Text: "When I saw her standing there at the train station, it was like a spotlight\
  \ shining on a Van Gogh amongst a crowd of black and white blobs. My stomach was\
  \ churning with excitement and nervousness. So was hers. \n\nShe drove the whole\
  \ five hours from Marseille to Chamonix; a ski town in the French Alps. It was her\
  \ idea for me to go with her there. I\u2019d met Clarisse less than two months prior.\
  \ I\u2019d traveled alone from Atlanta to Marseille, never thinking I'd ever be\
  \ back.  We had spent three days together before I left. It hadn't been enough.\
  \ \n\nThere must\u2019ve been at least forty people crammed in this bright red metal\
  \ box carrying us up towards Aguille du midi mountain top observatory. I\u2019d\
  \ never witnessed enormous snow covered mountain peaks like this before. Now I was\
  \ quickly floating upwards to the top of one. At the peak, there is an observation\
  \ deck made completely of glass from top to bottom, allowing you to look down at\
  \ the mountains below your feet. It\u2019s called \u201CThe Void\u201D. Clarisse\
  \ and I stepped into the void together, wearing matching slippers over our shoes\
  \ to keep from scuffing the glass. \n\n\u201CI can\u2019t believe I met a girl in\
  \ a bar in Marseille, and now I\u2019m standing with her at the top of a mountain,\u201D\
  \ I said. \n\n \u201COui! For me it\u2019s the same!\u201D she laughed. \n\nBack\
  \ in Marseille, I had a rare window into everyday life there. Marseille is a city\
  \ rich in history, ravaged by WWII, and scarred by a reputation of crime and poverty.\
  \ If you can look past the dirty streets, the fishy smell, the days with constant\
  \ wind gusts from the sea, and graffiti everywhere you turn, you will find a proud,\
  \ energetic people and an ever growing hub for art, cuisine, and entrepreneurialism.\
  \  \n\nIn some ways, Clarisse reflected her city. The loss of her father greatly\
  \ impacted who she is. She also has a brilliant, artistic mind with a stubborn yet\
  \ charming affinity for \"the French way\".   \n\n\"I could live on only bread,\
  \ cheese, and wine,\" she once told me. \n\nIn any city, you can never truly experience\
  \ all of its layers and depth. The same could be said for human beings. The blissful\
  \ enthusiasm she'd had for me when I arrived was fading, and the way she looked\
  \ at me began to feel as cold as the mountain air had been in Chamonix. She walked\
  \ with me all the way to the train again; to the very same place we'd reunited.\
  \ I kissed her goodbye. I knew it was probably for the last time. As the train began\
  \ to move away, a text buzzed in my pocket: \n\"C'est un au revoir, ce n'est pas\
  \ un adieu.\""
