Text: "This is not a travel story. It is a story of many travels. The location fits\
  \ with the manifold tale: a crossroad, where fourteen Kilometres of water, myths,\
  \ history, and opportunities divide two continents. \n\nThe legendary Pillars of\
  \ Hercules and their threat Non-Plus Ultra have collapsed into the sea under waves\
  \ of discoveries, their warning Non-Plus Ultra being more a challenge than a threat.\
  \ Today, the Strait of Gibraltar is a windy frame on the Atlantic Ocean and a gateway\
  \ to the American shores. On the narrowest point of the strait, Tarifa overlooks\
  \ the blurry profile of Tangier: behind them, the heavy shadows of Europe and Africa.\n\
  The silence and the Levanter run uncontested after each other on the paved streets\
  \ of the Old Town. It is low season in Tarifa. The city is sleeping, and we let\
  \ her sleep.\n\nAbsorbed in the hushed atmosphere of the hostel, few travellers\
  \ share a night of tales. \nMiriam says she prefers Tarifa in winter time. During\
  \ summer, beaches, streets, and pubs are flooded by thunderous tourists and amateur\
  \ kite surfers. In winter time, you find lone travellers in transit. They tell stories\
  \ of the places they have just been to with the raw enthusiasm of new experiences,\
  \ and the honesty reserved to a public of strangers. I guess she is right. \nOr\
  \ maybe not: a man from Birmingham is just back from a trip riding his motorbike\
  \ through the sinuous roads of Morocco\u2019s Atlas Mountain. To those who ask him\
  \ how it was, he sighs \u201CNot now. Tomorrow\u201D. That, it must be a good story.\
  \ \nOthers are more talkative. A German woman recounts of a travel she made years\
  \ ago: a husband, two daughters, and a boat, sailing from France to French Polynesia.\
  \ Along the way, storms, pirates and untamed bliss. A guy from Sarajevo came to\
  \ Tarifa planning to stay three weeks. That was ten months ago. In between, nights\
  \ spent in the timeless Sahara. An Italian boy is on his way back home after volunteering\
  \ in a village buried in the Moroccan dust, few Kilometres from Agadir. \u201CIt\
  \ took some time to get used to their life-style. But if you want to help and meet\
  \ extraordinary people, it is the right place\u201D. \n\nThat night I travelled\
  \ the world: I have been in places I will never explore, with people I will never\
  \ meet again.\n\nThe next morning, I left my work as volunteer at the hostel. At\
  \ 11 A.M., I watched Spain fading from the window of the ferry. Fifty minutes later,\
  \ I was looking at the maze of Tangier."
