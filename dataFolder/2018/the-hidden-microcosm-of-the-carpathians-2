Text: "The dispersed chalky light makes it impossible to sleep. We lean into yet another\
  \ u-turn on the Transfagarasan Highway, a concrete ribbon that meanders around the\
  \ desolate Carpathian peaks of Transylvania. These brake-burning turns make the\
  \ road passable for only three months each year. At this time, it has just reopened\
  \ and a trickle of cars bursts out from between the rocks down to the little village\
  \ of Arpasu de Sus, the forgotten terminus of the unused highway. \n\nArpasu de\
  \ Sus is a string of white two-storey houses where everyone knows everyone. Nestled\
  \ at the feet of the mighty Carpathians, it is the postcard Romanian village. Buni,\
  \ my host for the night, gesticulates towards her house. She hobbles her low centre\
  \ of gravity over the cobbles, waving to all the villagers on the way. Matters of\
  \ the stomach must be tended to immediately. \n\nThe Transylvanian meal begins with\
  \ a soured meatball stew. Before we can lift our spoons, Buni pulls out a plastic\
  \ CocaCola bottle refilled with a viscous transparent liquid. She twists off the\
  \ lid and takes a whiff of her plumy poison. Her grandson protests -\n\n- Buni,\
  \ you have a heart condition!\n- Not when we have guests \u2026\n\nPurring, she\
  \ pours a glassful for the guests, squinting her eyes likes a satiated cat.\n\n\
  - Is it your own brew?\n- No\u2026 it\u2019s Andrei\u2019s.\n\nI find out that Andrei\
  \ left Arpasu two years ago to work in the nearby city of Sibiu. After a disappointing\
  \ job search, he soon returned to the village to open a brewery in his cellar. The\
  \ villagers bring him fruits and he distills them into home-brew. He then returns\
  \ the finished product, charging a small helping for his own table. \n\nI hear Arpasu\
  \ has more blossoming entrepreneurs. Another less successful venture was the opening\
  \ of Arpasu\u2019s first ever strip club. In a town of two thousand, familiar faces\
  \ soon became a problem. When Bogdan ran into his daughter, the villagers put a\
  \ stop to the antics. \n\nWe all roar with laughter. Buni chuckles in a throaty\
  \ way, enjoying the fullness of her cottage that evening. The moonshine gets to\
  \ us. 'Noroc!' ('cheers!') We finish the night with a swig to Bogdan\u2019s health.\
  \ \n\nAs I leave early the next morning, Arpasu sleeps off the small-town revelries\
  \ of the last night. Only the whistle of the train breaks the stillness, as its\
  \ heavy wheels amble down the tracks. Moments after finding my carriage, I too slip\
  \ back into a nap, leaving Arpasu with the local gypsies commuting to the city and\
  \ the bear taking a shortcut through the woods."
