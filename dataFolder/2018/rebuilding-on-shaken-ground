Text: "It was my first day in Rishikesh and I had decided this place was magic. The\
  \ city, built around the majestic Ganges River, was seductive. Sitting on colorful\
  \ pillows in what would become my favorite local caf\xE9, I took in the simple presence.\
  \ The caf\xE9 owner had befriended us immediately, and was busy making veggie burgers\
  \ and mango lassies to welcome us. Nearby, a couple of young boys shared a single\
  \ pair of roller-skates, holding hands to catch their balance and skate as one.\
  \ They were content with all that they had. \nOutside the caf\xE9 there was a constant\
  \ buzz. The suspension bridge was only about an arms length in width. Yet the swaying\
  \ bridge made room for people, scooters, cows, and monkeys. The horns of scooters\
  \ trying to pass somehow fell in tune with the bells ringing from the ashrams just\
  \ up the eastern bank.  There was a pace that moved fast and then slow. The spirituality\
  \ that established this city encompassed both the modern and old. \nThe days leading\
  \ up to my arrival were a blur. We had been making our way westward around the globe.\
  \  India was on my list of \u201Cmust-see\u2019s\u201D, but \u201Cnot quite sure\
  \ how\u2019s\u201D. Jess had suggested we attend a yoga course in Rishikesh. The\
  \ ease of joining a program that would eliminate any planning was motivation enough\
  \ for me. At the time I had no idea how much I would need the healing of this experience.\
  \ The previous stop in our trip was Nepal. The Annapurna Trek had lured us in &\
  \ we arranged for a guide for a trek out of Pokhara. Gopi was a small Nepalese man\
  \ who was friendly, and had a way of capturing your heart one moment, then annoying\
  \ you to all ends the next. As we hiked Gopi had joked about Nepal & India. Nepal,\
  \ he said, stood for Never Ending Peace And Love. While India, he said with a cheeky\
  \ grin, stood for I\u2019ll Never Do It Again. He informed us that we\u2019d regret\
  \ leaving Nepal. Then the earthquake hit. The following days were filled with fear\
  \ and sadness. We witnessed courage and the strength of the human spirit. We made\
  \ the decision that it was time to move on to India. Nepal was in chaos, and needed\
  \ time and room to rebuild. Our hearts needed space to rebuild as well. \nNepal\
  \ had pushed me to the edge. It had shaken me to the core, literally and emotionally.\
  \ India would ground me again. The decision to push through the fear and continue\
  \ on our journey will forever be a defining moment. The connections made with other\
  \ students and the locals were life-changing, and too monumental to summarize in\
  \ this short essay."
