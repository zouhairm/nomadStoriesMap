Text: "I try to not take life too seriously all the time, which I believe has lead\
  \ to some great coincidences. Curious? I suggest you read and enjoy this little\
  \ story of mine.\nIt\u2019s a sunny and muggy January in the NE Australian Coast\
  \ and I\u2019m walking by myself, pretty thrilled. Cairns, at last, here I am.\n\
  In each direction I look, my eye catches some new mysterious and bizarre landscape.\n\
  To my left, the sky is so bright and clean that you can hardly distinguish it from\
  \ the equally vibrant blue ocean. \nOn the other side luxuriant shades of green\
  \ composed of perfectly balanced green leaf flora, imprint an unerasable picture-postcard\
  \ panorama.\n\u201CI\u2019m in wonderland\u201D. I can\u2019t stop repeating it\
  \ to myself, sometimes even suddenly out loud. I don't even try to force back my\
  \ child-like smile.\nFor now, I am enjoying the walk back to my hostel where sharing\
  \ stories & drinks make every evening so very social, by looking people in their\
  \ eyes and listening to true life stories.\nThe chat is getting interesting with\
  \ a friendly stranger and before I know it, a joint plan for tomorrow is made! Looks\
  \ like I\u2019m going to Kuranda, the rainforest market village!\nIf you are a railway\
  \ lover like me, this is a good out of town excursion.\nThe train journey offers\
  \ me changing views between impressive waterfalls and ravines. The itinerary includes\
  \ a scenic stop for immortalizing the Barron Gorge area. It truly would just be\
  \ rude not to take a picture!\nWooden houses and tropical flowers: this is my ultimate\
  \ idea of Paradise!\nI feel entranced walking across the local market, where locals\
  \ are selling their arsenal crafts. With the sound of nature filling my ears, the\
  \ unfamiliar beauty, I have even stopped caring about what the hot humid air is\
  \ doing to my face, let alone my hair! Snap back to reality - we have to run if\
  \ we don\u2019t want to miss the last train.\nBack at the hostel, I share another\
  \ beer with another friendly stranger, who is currently working here. I cannot believe\
  \ what I am hearing. He is not from Australia as I had naively assumed. He is from\
  \ Ireland, the green little land that I got to call home all of last year. What\
  \ more..? He is from that tiny little coastal town, where one year ago I saw a sign\
  \ that led me right to this moment: \u201CBook a ticket to Aussi Land!\u201D Isn\u2019\
  t that a coincidence? \""
