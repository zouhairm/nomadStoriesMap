Text: "When I traveled through Portugal I really didn\u2019t expect to arrive at my\
  \ last destination, the city of Porto, and found myself in Neverland. I was hosted\
  \ by Raul, known thanks to couchsurfing, who called his flat \u201CNunca Terra\u201D\
  , the Portuguese name of Neverland.\n\nRaul loves Porto, so I was lucky to visit\
  \ the city through his eyes and I soon fell in love with Porto, too. \n\nDuring\
  \ a walk on \u201CDom Luis I\u201D bridge, I noticed a kid lying on the other side\
  \ of the iron railing: he was shaking and was wearing nothing more than his underwear.\
  \ The wind was strong and salty, as carrying the force of the ocean, and the bridge\
  \ was vibrating because of it and also for the trams which were passing on the higher\
  \ level.\n\n\u201CDom Luis I\u201D bridge is 85 meters high and it has two decks,\
  \ Raul and I were walking on the lowest deck that\u2019s about 25 meters high and\
  \ under it, the Douro river flows.\n\nThe boy was waiting to jump in the river,\
  \ where in October the water is cold, but also deep and with a bad color. I turned\
  \ my head toward Raul and crossed his look, as he read my mind, he just said: \u201C\
  they do it for money\u201D and point my attention to another boy that was raising\
  \ money from the tourists on the shore. When the right amount of money was reached\
  \ his friend would jump. The kid, who was almost 12 years old, jumped in the dirty\
  \ water of the Douro river when his friend gave him the signal to do it.\n\nI was\
  \ curious and fascinated by what I had just seen: I was traveling in Europe, where\
  \ I visited a lot of cities before and Porto is the second most important city of\
  \ Portugal, I really didn\u2019t expect an underage kid jumped from a tall bridge.\n\
  \nI wanted to know more about that and I asked Raul to tell me everything he knew.\
  \ He took me to visit the Ribeira district, where the tradition to jump in the river\
  \ was born: there all the oldest people had jumped in the river, as did their children\
  \ and now their grandchildren and it has been something that happens since they\
  \ can remember.  At start kids, men or women jumped for fun, for refreshment during\
  \ summer, but sometimes when someone was very good at it, people threw coins to\
  \ the river to see kids diving to catch them. \u201CNow it\u2019s different\u201D\
  , Raul said, \u201Cpeople from other districts or cities also jump and no one is\
  \ going to do that for coins, so they raise money on the shore\u201D.\n\nThree months\
  \ earlier I was jumping from a 100 meters high bridge doing Bungee Jumping, but\
  \ I admired that kid to be so fearless."
