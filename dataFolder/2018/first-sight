Text: "At first, I was not able to recognize the marvellous construction that had\
  \ appeared before my eyes. Looking from the airplane, several thousand feet high,\
  \ its magnitude could climb all the way up and through the fuselage to reach my\
  \ unprepared heart. The ancient walls so full of powerful history that it would\
  \ be impossible, even for the least curious mind, not to wonder what is within that\
  \ palace. What secrets does it conceal beneath its roof?\nIt was my first trip to\
  \ England, a country I had always been very passionate about. From a very young\
  \ age, I would follow the British culture and make it my own. I would read about\
  \ the royals, learn about their lives, understand different British customs and\
  \ I clearly remember being absolutely fascinated about the subject. \nSo how fortunate\
  \ was I to have as my first ever view of the United Kingdom \u2013 well, a recognizable\
  \ view anyway, not just random fields \u2013 the very charming Kensington Palace.\
  \ It was an instant connection.\nFor most travellers, making a connection is an\
  \ easy task because they are so passionate about it and they expect to connect.\
  \ However, the kind of connection I felt at that very first sight was something\
  \ entirely new.\nHow could I explain it? I had not done anything, I was flying over\
  \ fields towards Heathrow airport, yet I felt this inexplicable feeling of belonging.\n\
  My eyes turned back to the palace as it slowly slid by as the plane kept going on\
  \ the way to Heathrow. Just like a magnet, I followed its image going by, unable\
  \ to stop myself and break that small visual contact that felt so incredibly strong.\n\
  Throughout my trips, I always felt connected to the locals because I was never one\
  \ for tourism. The joy was mixing with natives, learn about their real culture,\
  \ see places that are part of their daily routine, not monuments or touristic points.\n\
  I did that in England. I found this small bakery in the middle of Soho \u2013 the\
  \ theatre paradise, I must say \u2013 with the best cupcake I had ever tasted and\
  \ the waiter, noticing my accent, asked where I was from. Turns out we were from\
  \ the same city in Brazil. I wrote that down on my travel journal that night. I\
  \ always write everything down, so I can relive things whenever I miss them.\nIt\
  \ turns out the thing I want to relive most often is the sight of Kensington Palace\
  \ from the airplane. I am still not sure why, but no feeling ever struck me so strongly\
  \ as seeing that palace for the very first time. I guess it is because that is the\
  \ moment I knew I was home."
