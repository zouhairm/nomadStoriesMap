Text: "I was by myself in Vientiane, when I met a nice Australian guy in the hostel.\
  \ Apparently, both of his friends had an accident during the trip. One of them broke\
  \ his arm and the other one his leg. Then, he joked about bringing bad luck to other\
  \ people and said \u201Cbe on guard, now you are cursed\u201D.\n\nTwo weeks after\
  \ that, while being in Chiang Mai with a friend, we decided to visit a little mountain\
  \ village called Pai. We rent two motorbikes, so it would be easier to drive and\
  \ carry our backpacks.\nThe three hours drive was a very worthy experience, especially\
  \ because of the enchanting views and dense vegetation on the sides of the path.\
  \ The road was narrow, going up and down the hills, very steep and winding. Pai\
  \ was a bucolic town set on an isolated valley. We found an idilic tiny wooden hut\
  \ just a few meters from the riverside to spend the night. Unexpectedly, we had\
  \ a terrible time; it was freezing inside the cabin. We slept wearing so many layers\
  \ that we could barely move.\n\nOn our way back, after two and a half hours driving,\
  \ we saw a handwritten sign that indicated hot springs to our left. After such a\
  \ cold and long night we actually read \u201Croad to heaven\u201D. Shortly after\
  \ turning towards the baths, we realized that it was a gravel road, much steeper\
  \ and narrower than the other one. Nevertheless, we continued without hesitation.\
  \ I was enjoying the ride, driving quite fast after my friend. Suddenly, I fell\
  \ skidding and landing hard on my side. I injured myself quite badly because of\
  \ the gravel. In the hospital, they scratched my hands with a wire brush in order\
  \ to take out all the little stones from the wounds.\n\nThe following day, I had\
  \ a booked a cooking course which I decided to attend despite the injuries. The\
  \ class was held outdoors, under a covered porch. I will always remember how people\
  \ were staring at me entering the garden with electric blue band wrapped around\
  \ both my hands, half of my right arm and foot .\nWe were crashing peanuts and cutting\
  \ chilly to prepare Massaman curry when furious wind started blowing towards the\
  \ porch. Then, it started raining cats and dogs and all of a sudden, the power went\
  \ out. The wind was so powerful that it lifted part of the porch roof. At that very\
  \ moment, I did actually think that I was cursed. Luckily, we could finish the class\
  \ under the candlelight with no further problems. \nAfter that, I met the guy again\
  \ in Australia, who surely didn\u2019t expect me to be covered with bright white\
  \ bandage contrasting my tanned skin."
