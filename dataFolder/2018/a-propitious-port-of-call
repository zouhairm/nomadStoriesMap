Text: "It was an agonizing day and a half with bouts of sleep in between mad dashes\
  \ to the communal lavatory, unwelcome prayer sessions to the almighty porcelain\
  \ gods. I lay horizontal, staring at the top bunk for hours on end, gingerly sipping\
  \ the banana smoothie that my thoughtful neighbour had brought me, all the while\
  \ contemplating\u2026\u201CWas it the mayonnaise?\u201D I certainly didn\u2019t\
  \ feel fortunate at the time, but a memorable experience awaited me. I woke up the\
  \ next morning feeling more settled, and cautiously emerged from the hostel with\
  \ renewed sense of hope. Excited to explore Luang Prabang by foot, I set out on\
  \ the dusty roads in search of my favourite morning observance, a strong cup of\
  \ coffee. Once described to me as a jewel in the Laotian jungle, brimming with golden\
  \ wats, waterfalls and wonderful pastries, this town certainly did not disappoint.\
  \ I found a local caf\xE9 with views of the Nam Khan and sat there for hours as\
  \ local fishermen commiserated before continuing on with their daily routines. My\
  \ angelic 'Fruitshake Fairy' had told me about a volunteering opportunity that had\
  \ caught her eye the day before, a local bookstore that had set up a conversation\
  \ club for young Laotians to hone their conversation skills. An information sheet\
  \ outside the bookstore encouraged travelers and expats to show up at 5:00pm daily\
  \ to participate in a conversation exchange. The room was almost full when I arrived.\
  \ I noticed a young monk who was sitting quietly listening to the others around\
  \ him, while his excited companions exchanged names, countries, and pleasantries.\
  \ He appeared shy at first, but I could tell that he was eager to engage in conversation\
  \ despite his limited English vocabulary. When I explained that I was from Canada,\
  \ the young monk asked if I spoke French. I answered \u201Cbien s\xFBr\u201D, and\
  \ the previously reticent young man proceeded to speak French with me as if it was\
  \ his mother tongue. As a woman traveler, I knew this was a unique fortuity to speak\
  \ with a monk, as this type of interaction would be discouraged outside of this\
  \ setting. \u201CPhone\u201D, he explained, was a popular Laotian nickname, and\
  \ signified \u201Cwish\u201D. He shared tragic stories from his childhood as an\
  \ orphan, his passion for French literature, and his dream to move to Europe. Heartbroken\
  \ and unsure of how best to help him in this quest, I wrote down my contact information\
  \ as they closed up the shop, knowing deep down that Phone wouldn\u2019t be able\
  \ to reach out, but it was the right call to make at the time."
