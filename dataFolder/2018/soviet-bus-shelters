Text: "Bordered by snow capped mountains, and where not far off, canyons cut the ground,\
  \ it is here on this terrain, which is itself universally levelled out for miles,\
  \ I find the true collectivisation of knowledge and art and ideology levelled out\
  \ to the public in the decorative designs colouring the bus shelter in front of\
  \ me. It makes such a change from the unusual advertisements for chocolate bars\
  \ or movies or the latest heal your life fad book, that I\u2019m taken aback by\
  \ the boy in bright primary colours, elevated on the shoulders of his father and\
  \ colours emboldened by that beige carpet of desert like terrain where there is\
  \ little more than horse farms all the way to the Chinese border. \n\nAnd this is\
  \ perhaps what it means to be enlivened at the point of being exhaustively flat\
  \ out with nothing more than the tough labour of the working week stretched out\
  \ in front of you. Nowhere has that dichotomy of functionability and aesthetic been\
  \ destroyed for me as on that road out of Kazakhstan, on the easterly road from\
  \ Almaty, which seems to stretch on forever, and with no heavenly father above,\
  \ there is a new standard of higher worship in this child rising high in the hands\
  \ of the father land, the father and son a relatable image, easily collectivized\
  \ into the father of all, the USSR.\n\nThis is the very first bus shelter I come\
  \ across and the closest in proximity to Sharyn Canyon. Local people would have\
  \ caught the bus here to the nearest town, although it appears the most abandoned\
  \ spot for a bus I have ever seen. Where there are no highrise Soviet blocks to\
  \ fault the ideal, just the high-rise mountains, now snow-capped in October, the\
  \ joining of art and objects of use merged in a unification of political hope and\
  \ utilised.\n\nI fancy the driver who has dogemed space between the cars, beeping\
  \ his horn at any car interrupting this great spatial chase, consequently deserves\
  \ to forgive the sins of tourism; with this in mind, I keep my eyes peeled along\
  \ this road and feel no shyness in asking him to stop at every single one. The driver\
  \ certainly doesn\u2019t seem interested in the shelters, neither does the freelance\
  \ tour guide who seems to be under the impression that Sharyn Canyon was formed\
  \ as a sort of hollow rock phenonenon, as opposed to having once been a great river,\
  \ and informs me that the shelters are simply, \u201Cthe Soviet style.\u201D So\
  \ I adjust my self image to that of the eccentric tourist and find something seemingly\
  \ as monumental as the Sharyn Canyon itself that day."
