Text: "While deep in the rainforests of Argentina, I rescued a small monkey from a\
  \ snare of sorts. The monkey followed me there after. I called him Jasper. Jasper\
  \ loved mangos and bananas. We took long walks together and I told him of where\
  \ I came from, The States. I told him how in that land, the people are not free.\
  \ They have no pleasing rain forrests to explore and girls are hardly ever friends\
  \ with monkeys. I explained that it just wasn't done. Jasper seemed sad and told\
  \ me that I could stay with him and eat mangos and bananas. \nI was happy for a\
  \ time. But Jasper became sick. I didn't know what to do. We were so deep in the\
  \ rainforest. I took Jasper with me on a long journey, back to the states. I needed\
  \ to get medical attention for Jasper. After a lot of attention and rest, Jasper\
  \ was feeling better. He and I began to take walks in the city and eat mangos and\
  \ bananas. One day on such a walk, a tall man noticed Jasper. He told me Jasper\
  \ was a fine monkey. He offered me money for Jasper. I could never sell Jasper.\
  \ I told the tall man this and he became very angry. Jasper and I left in a hurry.\
  \ \nTwo days later, Jasper was missing! I searched for him everywhere. I looked\
  \ for him for months. And where did I find him? The Circus. The tall man made Jasper\
  \ wear a tiny hat and ride a bicycle. If Jasper performed well, the tall man would\
  \ give Jasper a mango or a banana. Jasper seemed so sad and unhappy. I dressed myself\
  \ as a clown and crept into the circus. There was Jasper! In a tiny cage. Without\
  \ thought, I grabbed the cage. I took Jasper on another long trip. We went back\
  \ to the rainforrest in Argentina, where we still live today. Jasper and I still\
  \ love to eat mangos and bananas. Jasper kept the tiny bicycle. He quite enjoyed\
  \ riding it."
