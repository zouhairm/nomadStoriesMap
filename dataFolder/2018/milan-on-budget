Text: "Milan on budget\n\nI know, probably, you cannot find Milan on \u201Ccheap student\
  \ destination\u201D, but it doesn\u2019t mean that you can\u2019t travel one of\
  \ the most expensive cities in Europe and don\u2019t spend a lot of money. So over\
  \ the weekend, I had a post-Erasmus reunion with my friends and Milan was the perfect\
  \ place, because of the culture and nightlife are booming even in the cold winter.\
  \ However, how did I manage to spend so little and see a lot in the capital of fashion?\n\
  \n1.       Trip itself\n\nMy trip was Bergamo \u2013 Manchester and back to Newcastle,\
  \ I did this because Bergamo is really close to Milan and Bergamo \u2013Manchester\
  \ has one of the cheapest tickets and it is not that far by bus, especially if you\
  \ spend on a couch just  1 pound with Megabus. Plus that way I visited Bergamo and\
  \ Manchester, so I 3 cities I have never been before.\n\n2.       Bergamo\nIf you\
  \ are going to Bergamo or Malpensa airport I really recommend to go to Bergamo it\
  \ is gorgeous towns and you can go up in the old town and see the Alpes and on which\
  \ side Switzerland is, by the way, they have the best gelato at Gelateria Gemma\
  \ and lunch would be cheaper than in Milan.\n\n3.       Food\nIt is one of the most\
  \ important parts of the trip in Italy: pasta, pizza, panzerotti, arancini and all\
  \ other words that make you daydream, but how make it cheap and still have the best\
  \ food coma? Here helps you to know locals, I had the best guides that I met on\
  \ my Erasmus, but there are other ways as Couchsurfing, meets and greets, facebook\
  \ groups, free tours. I suggest the famous Milan 'Aperitivo', you spend around 11\
  \ euros and you get one drink and all you can eat, you can go to Navigli canal they\
  \ have a lot of happy hours and the view is spectacular.\n\n5.       Sightseeing\n\
  There is so much to see in Milan, from famous Duomo di Milano to fashion streets\
  \ and again I really encourage try to meet some locals, they will know better were\
  \ and when best to visit museums and where is the best and most expensive shopping\
  \ street (just for looking, this is the trip on budget), but one thing you have\
  \ to do is go to Duomo terrace it is around 12 pounds, but you won\u2019t regret\
  \ it and remarkable Sforza Castle is for free to go around.\n\nAnd that is how I\
  \ managed to do my trip on a budget and I could even do a better job, but Italian\
  \ food was just too delicious to say no."
