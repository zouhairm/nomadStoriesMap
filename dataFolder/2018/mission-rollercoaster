Text: "Located in South West London, Thorpe Park was the big, red exclamation mark\
  \ on my map. As we drove closer in a small Vauxhall, we could see a tall, white\
  \ roller coaster rising high. My body felt strangely stiff. It wasn\u2019t my first\
  \ time in a theme park, but it would be my first time on a roller coaster. My parents\
  \ wouldn\u2019t let me go on one when I was younger, they were too afraid something\
  \ would go wrong. I don\u2019t blame them. \nWe went through security and I stepped\
  \ into craziness. I had a look around me. There were families, enjoying a day out\
  \ with their children - they were nowhere close to the big rides. There were teenagers,\
  \ out on dates, having fast food and milkshakes. There was a stall with gigantic\
  \ donut pillows!\nThe first ride was a so called helicopter; you just spin around\
  \ in circle. Sitting next to me was Ash. He\u2019s been going to Thorpe Park for\
  \ years. His younger brother, now in the states, used to work in the park when they\
  \ were teenagers. So Ash would sneak inside, with his brother\u2019s help, and he\
  \ would go from one roller coaster to another. That\u2019s why he asked me go with\
  \ him, to show me this new world. I was on my tour around London, but I never thought\
  \ roller coasters would be part of the plan. I fastened my seat belt, the ride started\
  \ and off we went. I had tears in my eyes when the ride stopped, and we were both\
  \ shaking. The ground felt like heaven.\nAs we were still wobbling around, he started\
  \ telling me how the park had been rebuilt in the 70s, and how it used to have older\
  \ rides, even wooden ones. Now all the rides were new and exciting, reinforced with\
  \ steel. He put an emphasis on steel. We kept walking around.\nThe next ride was\
  \ Nemesis. We waited in a long line, minutes went by. Our turn came, and as the\
  \ girl that worked there pushed down to secure my restraint, I felt terrified. But\
  \ then I realized something, I came off a plane a few days before that. I like flying,\
  \ it\u2019s my safe place. And now, I was in London, enjoying the sun (yes, the\
  \ sun!) and I had pie and chips the day before, one of the best food of London.\
  \ I closed my eyes, the ride took off. As the air rushed past my cheeks, I opened\
  \ my eyes \u2013 we were flying. Adrenaline took over the fear. I fell in love with\
  \ it.\nThorpe Park has different rides for different stomachs. It even has a beach\
  \ that works over the summer time if you really only want to get a tan. The ticket\
  \ price is affordable.\nI\u2019m dating Ash now. We\u2019re on a roller coaster\
  \ mission. Funny things happen when you travel."
