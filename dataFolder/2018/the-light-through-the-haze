Text: "Through the narrow cobblestoned streets of Havana, I fell in love. You could\
  \ feel Hemmingway\u2019s wounded spirit and sea filled gaze. You begin to understand\
  \ why the legend called this island his home. The colors and sounds of Cuba come\
  \ alive, not only around you, but inside you. They enchantingly begin to sway your\
  \ soul into the ebb and flow of local life.\nThe years of political instability,\
  \ war and revolution still hover thickly in the air. The incredible thing though\
  \ - through that heavy fog - the Cuban people let their light shine so bright that\
  \ eventually you no longer see the fog, only the light. \nValle de Vi\xF1ales. The\
  \ unique mogotes - rare mountain formations - with waterfalls of greenery draping\
  \ over them called to the climber within me. \nStanding in the A-frame that housed\
  \ the drying tobacco leaves your senses are flooded. The thousands of tobacco leaves\
  \ drying looked like leathery bats, hanging with ease from the rafters as high as\
  \ the eye could see. \nThe local family taught us their traditional ways in growing\
  \ and harvesting their tobacco. Teaching us that their cigars are pure: no pesticides,\
  \ no additives. Just authentic, pure cigars. Filled only of rolled tobacco leaves,\
  \ rituals and love. \n\u201CThe trick gentlemen, is to soak the tip of the cigar\
  \ in honey, that\u2019s how you get the women to take their clothes off.\u201D We\
  \ all giggled but knew there was an undeniable truth in his words. \nWith my blonde\
  \ hair and blue eyes, the cigars were a constant accessory on my face. As I dipped\
  \ my hand-rolled cigar into the raw honey, it dripped as it traveled to my lips.\
  \ Savoring every drop and inhaling the beyond natural, earthy flavor. It changed\
  \ me. \nI never expected a cigar would play a key role in transforming me from a\
  \ girl into a woman. I never expected the people and culture of Cuba to transcend\
  \ me into a euphoric state of realization. The realization that magic can live in\
  \ the oppressed. Then again, I did not realize the color that was missing from my\
  \ own soul before experiencing the indefinable mysticism of Cuba. \nIn the end we\
  \ did not only return home changed and full of gusto, salsa and rum. The shocking\
  \ twist that this eclectic world gave us was that we returned to the United States,\
  \ as the modern-day rebels of our own country. Craving purity and a revolutionary\
  \ call for authenticity. Convincing me that the \u201CLost Generation\u201D of Hemingway\u2019\
  s time has not disappeared, but still exists in the crevasses of those filled with\
  \ gumption, adventure, and Cuban cigars."
