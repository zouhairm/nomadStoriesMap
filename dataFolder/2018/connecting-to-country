Text: "Origins of my wanderlust lay rooted in my childhood connection to this vast\
  \ echoing country- home to the oldest existing indigenous culture on earth. I grew\
  \ up in the Central Australian desert, 850 kilometres inland from the closest city.\
  \ The family drive there was long and sweltering. With the windows down we\u2019\
  d breathe the dusty air, the vinyl seats sticking to our sweaty skin. As the terrain\
  \ shifted from farmland to bush to the iconic red soil plains we\u2019d spot emus\
  \ and eagles. But my favourite sightings were the Afghan Cameleers- first invited\
  \ to Australia in the late 1800s; they transported construction equipment for some\
  \ of our earliest infrastructure including the overland telegraph and Trans-Australian\
  \ railway.\n\nVoyaging deeper into the desert Dad appointed my brother and I as\
  \ sentinels. Our mission was to watch for Big Reds that could jump out without warning\
  \ potentially rolling cars if hit. As day drew to dusk the golden sun descended\
  \ on the shadowed plains blanketing the sky red. It beaconed welcoming us home.\
  \ Temperatures in our opal mining town scorched at 57\xB0C with parched red clay\
  \ caked into slabs. When dust storms swept through we\u2019d retreat into our dugouts-\
  \ underground homes carved from cool hard rock, naturally ventilated to a comfortable\
  \ 21\xB0C.\n\nHere I grew up with the Pitjantjatjara community. Through school plays,\
  \ art and song we learned of The Dreaming- the spirit and lore of the land. After\
  \ school my Aboriginal friends and I would sit on the monkey bars giggling as we\
  \ shared sweets and stories of animal spirits. On weekends families would go bush\
  \ for a barbie. The kids explored, taking kangaroo bones from dingo dens, later\
  \ rejoining the adults for damper baked on buried campfire coals. At home I\u2019\
  d sift through sand for precious treasure. Coloured rocks for chalk drawings; gypsum,\
  \ a flaky crystal believed to contain special healing energy; potch, opal with shifting\
  \ spectral hues; and tektites, black glass formed by the molten derby of meteorites.\n\
  \nYet my greatest joy was beneath the night\u2019s sky. I\u2019d drag out an old\
  \ mattress and lay under the stars, the warmth of the day seeping up from the earth\
  \ beneath me, the night\u2019s cool desert breeze gently caressing my skin. Starlight\
  \ filled the sky- the swirls of the Milky Way, moving satellites and shooting stars.\
  \ Here rapt in my childhood wonderment I felt a connection to something expansive.\
  \ Filled with a sense of belonging I\u2019d lay there in awe. This was my Australian\
  \ lullaby, my Dreaming Story."
