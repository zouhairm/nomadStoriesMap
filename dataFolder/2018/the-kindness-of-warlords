Text: "\u2018George Bush and Tony Blair!\u2019\n\nA long finger wagged between our\
  \ faces, and with a broad grin the Wagah border official handed back our papers.\
  \ Rolland and I shared nervous glances, at each other, then our American and British\
  \ passports. Only ten steps to the border, but India seemed a long way away.\n\n\
  The road to Lahore presented subtle changes, those that come with the crossing of\
  \ an imaginary line; differences barely perceptible in increments, yet so stark\
  \ when leapt by a plane.\n\nIn Lahore, we were led out of the train station and\
  \ down a nearby ally. Chai shops quietened as the call to prayer resonated across\
  \ the city. As we sat down, the large hand of Ahmed reach across the table to collect\
  \ our incorrect tickets \u201Cwhere do you want to go?\u201D \n\u201CIslamabad\u201D\
  \ I said.\nWithout a word he handed the tickets to his skinny friend / henchman,\
  \ and with the briefest of nods our tickets left the chai shop.\n\nOver tea we chatted.\
  \ Almost every sentence was disturbed by a new arrival, an obsequious handshake;\
  \ Ahmed beamed \u201CJust some business\u201D.\n\nSilently our tickets returned,\
  \ were handed to Ahmed for his approval, and gifted back to us.  \u201CYour train\
  \ is not until late. You should see Lahore. You must eat\u201D slowly, the pull\
  \ of an invisible string was drawing us into the life of a stranger wrapped in enigma.\n\
  \nWe entered a tuk tuk, and were rapidly bounced past brightly lit street stalls;\
  \ the orange blue sky giving way to black; minarets silhouetted before the final\
  \ flood of darkness.\n\nSoon we left the bustle of the city centre, the bumps in\
  \ the road became deeper, the streets narrower, the stalls less frequent. We were\
  \ entering a slum area on the outskirts of the city. We turned sharply down an ally,\
  \ just wide enough for the tuk tuk on an inhale. The urban canyon opened again to\
  \ a large house, rising up behind high compound walls. \n\nWe ate on the floor,\
  \ surrounded by an entourage never introduced. Rice dishes, chutneys, curried mutton.\
  \ Conversation hovered around the recent drone attacks in Waziristan, out in the\
  \ wild west, where Pakistan borders with Afghanistan. Ahmed told us of his regular\
  \ visits to the tribal areas, to the markets of Peshawar where hash, and guns, and\
  \ rocket launchers fill the stalls. After tea, we were once again mounting a tuk\
  \ tuk: the return leg not holding the same sense of unease.\n\nWe parted at the\
  \ train station with crushing bear hugs, and hand crippling shakes.\n \nOn the platform,\
  \ Rolland looked uneasy\u2026 \u201CI think we just had dinner with a warlord.\u201D"
