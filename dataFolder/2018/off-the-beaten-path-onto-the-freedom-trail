Text: It all started on the pulchritudinous Needles Highway in the beautiful South
  Dakota forest. My beloved family & I were en route to the famous Mt. Rushmore when
  suddenly my uncle pulled over for an "emergency" restroom break on the side of the
  road.  While awaiting my uncle's elongated cessation, I was investigative of our
  surroundings & managed to see an old beaten up sign that read "Sioux Springs".  With
  my profound interests in Native American history, I figured I would get out of the
  van & check it out. So, after crossing an old rickety bridge I hear Lakota in the
  distance, (which is the language that the Sioux tribe speaks) & I was instantly
  filled with even more curiosity, timidness & a yet desire to continue towards the
  voices, only to find a truly unique undertaking. A couple of young tribesmen were
  fixing the spring & loading large stones down the hill to one another, while over
  to my right their father was painting a ravishing scenery upon a teepee. I stood
  still in a daze completely astonished of what I had come upon until I hear, "greetings
  there brother!'' I uttered back "well hello there, I hope I'm not intruding but
  this is amazing!" One of the young tribesmen said "absolutely not, welcome! I proceeded
  to introduce myself & participated in loading the rocks to the bottom of the hill
  to "tidy" up the fragmented spring.  Not too long after, my family followed my footsteps
  & stumbled upon us & decided to speak a while with the painting father as we rebuilt
  the spring.  During these tasks, I proceeded to ask more about them & their truly
  unique lifestyles & learned quite a bit of interesting facts about the Sioux tribe.
  Shortly after finishing the spring, I decided to grab my guitar from the van & share
  my music with them all & it was truly a memorable moment. After rejoicing in song
  together I exchanged emails with Jared or "the turtle moccasin boy"  & have still
  remained to occasionally update one another & stay up to date on what is going on
  in our beautiful lives. Everything about that escapade was my kind of style. I am
  one who enjoys traditional history, to learn about it & how to be informed on how
  to not repeat it but I LOVE trailblazing & flowing towards truly uncommon, unusual
  & unearmarked wonders that lay awaiting discovery by that special someone. I feel
  as if this opportunity to go to Argentina & learn personally from Tim Neville, will
  be quite special, educational & beneficial for my future. Thank you so very much
  & take care.
