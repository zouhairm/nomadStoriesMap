Text: "When you think of Sydney, you might conjure up in your mind- Finding Nemo,\
  \ the Sydney Opera House, and of course, shrimp on the barbie. While my trip did\
  \ consist of trekking near the spectacular Sydney Opera House- there is so much\
  \ more many don\u2019t know about besides the regular, \u201Ctourist traps\u201D\
  .\nI stayed in a suburb outside Sydney called, Matraville. The streets are bustling\
  \ in the mornings with construction workers and students in their uniforms running\
  \ to catch the bus, small restaurants opening up, and in the air- the smell of strong,\
  \ delicious coffee. Australians admit they\u2019re indeed coffee snobs. And I tell\
  \ you, when I tasted a lick with extra espresso, I was addicted. Only a 20 minute\
  \ walk from where I was staying was the quiet retreat of Malabar Beach. Some locals\
  \ there never even heard of Malabar Beach. I found a gem. It is only a 25 minute\
  \ drive south of the city. We are creatures of habit, and I came to find most Australians\
  \ have their favorite places and stick to them. I for one like to explore every\
  \ nook and cranny. One dumb thing me and my cousins did- swim in a rock pool while\
  \ it's lightening. Victoria slapping the water yells, \u201CI\u2019m the God of\
  \ the ocean\u201D, like a lunatic trudging forward. I just died laughing taking\
  \ cover from the storm videotaping. What put the cherry on the cake was when walking\
  \ home from the beach a passing car pegged an egg at me. I yelled, \u201Cwhat the\
  \ bloody hell?\u201D I thought something fell from a tree, only to look down and\
  \ see an egg cracked on the pavement. Quickly looking up I caught a smirk on the\
  \ ranga\u2019s (red head) face driving away. Needless to say, we laughed all the\
  \ way home. The other place worth mentioning is Wattamolla- cove and beach nestled\
  \ between cliffs. We nervously climbed our way up one of the cliffs to take a jump\
  \ off. It was a rush! I made the mistake of flailing my arms out, but at least I\
  \ wasn\u2019t as bad as the drunk Aussie. He did a belly flop from 25 feet up. A\
  \ man shouts, \u201CHe\u2019s going to lose his budgie smugglers!\u201D I had no\
  \ idea what that meant, so I was enlightened on the Australian slang for Speedo...\
  \ Anywhere you go- explore, talk to everyone, try different things outside your\
  \ comfort zone, and most importantly, enjoy yourself."
