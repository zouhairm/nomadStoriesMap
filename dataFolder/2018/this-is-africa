Text: "It was for the savannah grasslands and wildlife I had purchased my new zoom\
  \ lens, not knowing that I would be returning home with unforgettable experiences,\
  \ not just my 3x5\u2019s. \u201CKeep tomorrow free, I want to take you around Cape\
  \ Town\u201D said Stephen. An articulate, knowledgeable man with dark hair and dark\
  \ eyes whom we had met at the bar and known for one hour. We were speechless, surprised\
  \ then completely thrilled. For a moment we thought why would a stranger do this?\
  \ But that moment lasted for what seemed like a split second. Our day with Stephen\
  \ was comprised of stopping in at small towns around Cape Town and seeing the major\
  \ landmarks. The town of Llandudno will always resonate with me. This picturesque\
  \ town housed million dollar mansions beautifully landscaped along the hilly winding\
  \ roads. Occupied by wealthy residents requiring the service of a maid, mostly Black\
  \ Africans. However, the residents banned public transportation into the town, making\
  \ it hard for the maids to reach their destination, which they often have to get\
  \ to by foot. This is one of many struggles Stephen mentioned about Cape Town. Parting\
  \ from Stephen, we joined a walking tour where we met Ken, our tour guide. Ken was\
  \ in his late twenties, tall and slim, tousled blonde-hair with inquisitive eyes\
  \ and a great story teller. After a couple of beers on a comfortably chilly evening,\
  \ Ken said \u201CMy mom would love to meet you both\u201D. \u201CWe\u2019d be glad\
  \ to meet her!\u201D we instantly replied. Dusk was falling rapidly as we were walking\
  \ to the car and I noticed that Ken had been wearing his backpack on the front with\
  \ one of his hands resting inside his bag. \u201CFor protection\u201D he reassured\
  \ me. Slightly scared but at the same time feeling relieved as we walked to his\
  \ car. It was a beautiful drive along the coast with the smell of the salty atlantic\
  \ ocean in the air. Ken\u2019s mom, who was a police officer during the apartheid\
  \ regime greeted us at the door and shared stories from her past. \u201CA troubled\
  \ city then is still a troubled city now\u201D she said, requiring to keep one rifle\
  \ and a hand gun for protection. \u201CIt\u2019s just not safe here, our home has\
  \ been broken into many times\u201D she said. As we were leaving, Ken handed me\
  \ a necklace with a shark\u2019s tooth; a beautiful memorable gift for a lifetime.\
  \ The landscape, nature and wildlife of Africa will always remind me how beautiful\
  \ it is, but it\u2019s the stories of the people, their struggles and the friendships\
  \ made that will forever and always bring me back to this land."
