Text: 'I decided to book a 10 stop ticket with Air Canada a few years ago! One of
  the stops I selected was Havana! With it being a communist country the stories or
  misconceptions about this place are cemented within the minds of many. I had no
  idea what to expect so I packed my backpack, made no accommodation arrangements
  and decided I''d ''figure it out'' on my own! I took a flight from Toronto to Havana
  and once I landed-I had no idea what to do. I didn''t speak or understand any Spanish,I
  didn''t have a phrasebook and I''d never been to Cuba. I asked if there was anywhere
  I could stay in English and I was directed to a female Taxi Driver. She gestured
  that she would be taking me to a few guest houses to stay until I found the one
  I liked. Every home we visited people refused for the oddest reason: Their homes
  weren''t ''good enough'' for me.....All I wanted was a place to stay for the three
  weeks or more I intended to stay and when they saw I was a woman they said ''Non''
  my house is not good. I was shocked-it was so different from what I''ve experienced
  in other countries or even trying to rent an apartment at home. Finally, our second
  last stop-the older lady that answered the door was so excited I arrived and she
  showed me the room I''d be staying in and gave me a tour of the house. It felt like
  an old and beautifully weathered 1950s era home with a roof top/balcony! I enjoyed
  my stay, she cooked dinner everyday and I always had something to look at. The house
  was filled with velvet and antiques EVERYWHERE!'
