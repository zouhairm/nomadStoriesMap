Text: "What would you do if you had one last summer night in Italy? I spent mine sleeping\
  \ on newspaper at the airport. \nBeing the budget traveller that I am, I decided\
  \ to stay the night until my morning flight back home. Walking around with my suitcase,\
  \ I found a door that led to a small chapel. I went inside, sitting on one of the\
  \ benches. And I closed my eyes, with memories from the past six weeks flashing\
  \ through my mind.  \nLast summer, I made the spontaneous decision to teach English\
  \ in Italy. I was nervous about going to a place where I was unfamiliar with the\
  \ language and culture. Yet the travelbug inside my head convinced me to take a\
  \ chance anyways.\nThis program was unusual in that it involved theatre in teaching.\
  \ I found myself shouting and singing to silly phrases like \"Happy llama\" (which\
  \ is stuck with me forever). \nThroughout my stay, I lived with three different\
  \ host families. One was a family of doctors in Venice, another a family of farmers\
  \ in Ravenna, and a family of artisans in Turin. Though each family was distinct,\
  \ their common thread was that they owned dogs (twelve at the farm!). \nMy classes\
  \ were filled with bright yet goofy kids who slipped into Italian more than I could\
  \ count. I sparked a connection with these students by teaching them English but\
  \ also sharing my experience as a Korean American. From their hand gestures of frustration\
  \ to their amused faces when singing Happy Llama, I felt grateful for that Google\
  \ search that led me here. \nThrough conversations at the dinner table, games and\
  \ lessons in the classroom, and gelato and spritz in my free time, I became familiar\
  \ with a place I was hastily searching for information not long ago. As much as\
  \ the destination is enriching, the people truly add a rich flavor to the experience.\
  \ \nAlthough the whole trip was memorable, I will say the fondest memory I have\
  \ is riding a boat to the island of Burano. Looking out the window, I could see\
  \ the sun setting and the waters glistening.  I turned my head back to face my two\
  \ friends, all of us excited to visit a beautiful island of colors. And then I looked\
  \ back at the sea, soaking in the present moment. \nI usually struggle to come up\
  \ with a fun fact on the spot whenever I'm in a social setting for the first time.\
  \ Previous answers were rather boring, like \"I lived in Virginia my whole life\"\
  \ or \"my mom named me after watching Kevin Costner on The Bodyguard.\" But now\
  \ I have one I can say with a grin: I lived on a farm in Italy for two weeks."
