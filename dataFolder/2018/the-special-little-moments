Text: "The great Nelson Mandela said:  \"If you talk to a man in a language he understands,\
  \ that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his\
  \ heart.\"\nI would like to share with you some of the most precious moments I have\
  \ experienced when speaking to people in their own language:\n\nSalamanca, Spain:\
  \ 'Little Girl Talk'\nIn a Chocolate Caf\xE9, where EVERYTHING on the menu was made\
  \ of chocolate, I met a little girl who was no more than five years old. I asked\
  \ her how her 'Death by Chocolate' cake was and she said, with a big chocolaty grin,\
  \ that it was really, really yummy. Having gotten such an enthusiastic recommendation\
  \ I ordered the very same thing myself. My little friend was wearing a scarf with\
  \ Anna and Elsa, from 'Frozen', on it. Naturally enough, that is the direction the\
  \ conversation would go in. We proceeded to sing \xBFY si hacemos un mu\xF1eco?\
  \ (Do You Wanna Build a Snowman?), which I had luckily been learning. That was my\
  \ eureka moment. That was the moment when I realised I was completely Ciara in Spanish.\
  \ That was the very same way I would have spoken in English to a little five year\
  \ old girl back home in Ireland. If I hadn't spent all those hours and hours cramming\
  \ all those Spanish verb conjugations into my head, that special moment could never\
  \ have happened.\n\nPerugia, Italy: 'The Dapper Italian Gentleman':\nI was lost.\
  \ Lost and late for mass...again. Just in that moment a most dapper looking, elderly\
  \ man appeared out of a side street. He wore a smart navy suit, well polished shoes\
  \ and a red and blue dickie bow. I asked him where the church was, to which he replied;\
  \ 'I'm ninety you know, and I'm terribly deaf. Your church is straight down there\
  \ (and he pointed towards another street)'. If I had not spent the previous two\
  \ years slaving over Italian grammar and vocabulary it is likely that I would still\
  \ be standing in the middle of all of those narrow, windy Italian streets, lost\
  \ and late and trying to find the church.\n\nThose little moments may have made\
  \ no impression on the girl in the Chocolate Caf\xE9 or the ninety year old Italian\
  \ man, but I will never forget them. For those little moments, which panned out\
  \ so casually and naturally, were the very reason I set out to learn Spanish and\
  \ Italian in the first place."
