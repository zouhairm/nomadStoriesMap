Text: 'A few years ago, I had attended a military exercise along with a few other
  batchmates as a part of an educational tour. We reached at a Godforsaken place,
  and was taken in a military vehicle to another location fifty miles away from there.
  On either side of the road, lay wilderness and huge sand dunes, wild shrubs and
  the air was filled with dust and heat waves.

  We reached an area filled with tents, which were camouflaged in combat cloth, and
  we were assigned tents for ourselves, where we were to sleep in sleeping bags. It
  was burning hot, and we felt hotter because we had to be wearing our uniforms. As
  the day progressed towards dusk, the temperature kept decreasing, till at the end
  of sunset, it was freezing cold. With sunset, the sky was covered in a canopy of
  stars, and if the ground was not infested with snakes and scorpions, one could spend
  the whole night lying and gazing at them.

  Imagine complete darkness, with a star-studded sky, and deadly animals below, and
  imagine the adrenaline rushing through one''s body. Those very few days were enough
  to make me decide to join the Army, and I have never looked back since then.'
