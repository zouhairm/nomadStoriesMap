Text: "There\u2019s a fine line between pressing the snooze button to uncovering the\
  \ comforts of lying in bed, reaching to the ceiling and getting on with the beginning\
  \ of the day. Let\u2019s just be honest, outside looked terrible with sleet blowing\
  \ onto the window outside, why did I even bother?\nDense up-slope fog pressed through\
  \ the gaps in the conifer trees, swaying in time with my thoughts to why I still\
  \ wasn\u2019t laying in the warmth of my bed. As the line of conifers became distant\
  \ stems of dark green, my eyes are drawn to a faint line of ice clinging precariously\
  \ close the shards of schist below. My feet begin to develop traction as I trudge\
  \ ever so closer to the summit; however my mind continues to drift back to the comforts\
  \ of home. Every step I gain elevation, the line becomes more clear, as if it was\
  \ progressing towards a barrier from me and my comfort zone. \nThick, grey fog began\
  \ to break with every movement toward the summit. Next thing I know, a feeling of\
  \ warmth begins to press onto the shivering skin of my cheeks. It began to feel\
  \ that I needed to take each painstaking step and if I didn\u2019t I would end up\
  \ in a world much too comfortable for what I perceived. \nWhat grew in front of\
  \ me became brighter and brighter. A pale blue light began to thaw any decision\
  \ to turn around. My cheeks, once red with cold air soaked in those first rays of\
  \ light as I passed from the depths of the inversion fog to into the pressing warmth\
  \ of what many would not know lay above them.  \nThat thin line between getting\
  \ out of bed and breaking through the barrier of pain and cold became an inversion\
  \ layer, drifting from the rippling surface of Lake Wakatipu to the crooked ice\
  \ peak of Ben Lomond, all that need is a simple decision. \nBen Lomond summit was\
  \ reached at 09:05am and what remained below became swayed in a complexion of New\
  \ Zealand\u2019s winter as the harsh conditions swelled beneath.\nThat morning in\
  \ New Zealand, I had a choice. Should I press snooze? Or should I take a risk into\
  \ an unknown void that would one day be the deciding factor that would guide me\
  \ to summiting some New Zealand\u2019s and Australia\u2019s most difficult peaks\
  \ or to saying \u2018yes\u2019 to a 48 hour non-stop hike to helping people in need.\
  \ \nA fine line can tip you any direction, but once you break that through that\
  \ layer anything is possible. Choose with your heart and just trust what's behind\
  \ that wall you are facing because it will be something truly beautiful."
