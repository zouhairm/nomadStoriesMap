Text: "\u201CI cannot go further than this, if you want to go, you have to do it alone\
  \ or I will lose my liscence in case of an accident\u201D, the guide, Laal said,\
  \ about 400 meters away from the mouth of the glacier. However, that wouldn\u2019\
  t stop my over enthusiastic fellow traveller Shaurya from venturing further towards\
  \ our destination. Encouraged by him, I trudged forward too towards the snout of\
  \ the Gangotri glacier, Gaumukh, named so because it resembled the mouth of a cow.\
  \ Even though the cow snout melted and receded about 1.5 kilometers in the last\
  \ 70 years, it is still named so, which might tell us something about India\u2019\
  s fixation with the \u2018holy cow\u2019. But my sarcastic mental monologue came\
  \ to a halt when i finally came face to face with the view. It made me forget my\
  \ fatigue of climbing 19 kilometers uphill, from the base camp Gangotri in a few\
  \ hours. The river Bhagirathi, one of the major tributaries of River Ganges flowed\
  \ though the valley and the roar of the water somehow amplified the silence of the\
  \ place which was surrounded with a panoramic view of the three Bhagirathi peaks\
  \ on one side and the Shivlinga peak on the other. Located 4255 meters above sea\
  \ level, the glacier was thousands of years old and far away both physically and\
  \ aesthetically from the bustling metropolis I am used to. Looking at the view,\
  \ I was suddenly reminded of the stories I had heard in my childhood of saints crossing\
  \ through here to reach Tapovan, which lay about 4 kilometers uphill, in their quest\
  \ to attain 'moksha'. An improvised temple made out of rocks and flags lay near\
  \ the boulder which marked the entrance to the valley. It had paradoxically lasted\
  \ so long that even Laal\u2019s father, or his father before him, who were also\
  \ guides had heard stories about it being there ever since they could remember.\
  \ The temple, the pristine river and the glacier itself evoked a feeling of respect\
  \ that pushed the cynical part of me aside. It was the last thing I expected. Being\
  \ a student of Sociology I consciously make it a point to side step the religious\
  \ sentiments. However at that point it didn't matter. I dipped my feet in the icy\
  \ waters and seeked its blessing like I had seen my grandparents do so many times\
  \ in the murky waters of the same Ganges when it reached its last stage in Kolkata.\
  \ As the cool water drops fell on my face, i felt ridiculously comfortable so far\
  \ out of my comfort zone."
