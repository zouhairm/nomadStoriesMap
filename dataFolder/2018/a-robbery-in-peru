Text: "The husband and wife had the kindest faces I had ever seen. Faces so kind they\
  \ made your heart hurt; with brimming eyes and patient smiles. Their every gesture\
  \ was a giveaway of their trusting inner lives.\nPerhaps that\u2019s why the thief\
  \ targeted their guesthouse to rob us.\nThe guesthouse, the cheapest we could find\
  \ in the Peruvian hiking mecca of Huaraz, was essentially a home with a few extra\
  \ rooms for travelers: a Christmas tree in the corner, a stew of something meaty\
  \ perpetually brewing in the kitchen.\nThey poured us steaming cups of coca tea\
  \ while we discussed our lives in halting Spanish, and played with the animals their\
  \ youngest daughter kept bringing out for us - rabbits, dogs, a kitten. Once, she\
  \ screamed with laughter after producing a terrified chicken and chasing us around\
  \ the living room with it.\nThe theft happened on our third night. I put everything\
  \ I valued in a bag before my friend and I left for dinner - passport, phone, money,\
  \ brand new camera - and checked the lock twice before we plunged into the chilly\
  \ streets.\nIt was my friend who first noticed something was amiss. The key swung\
  \ uselessly in circles when she put it in the door. We looked at each other with\
  \ alarm and rushed in.\nIt felt bizarrely like I had entered a real-life spot the\
  \ difference puzzle: everything was there, except for - the black bag near the bed.\n\
  After that, it was pandemonium. The whole family rushed upstairs; other guests were\
  \ yelling about their own stolen possessions. My stomach was backflipping, and I\
  \ choked back sobs that were gathering in my throat. What would I do without my\
  \ passport? We all marched off to the police station, where we were told to come\
  \ back in the morning.\nI didn\u2019t sleep well that night.\nAt about 7 a.m. I\
  \ leaped out of bed, found the male half of the couple, and frantically asked to\
  \ use the computer to begin making arrangements. \nAnd then, I took in the scene.\
  \ The cozy but tiny room, with intermittent electricity, the kitchen cupboards filled\
  \ with cheap staples, the worn clothing in the basket. I watched the way he started\
  \ up his painfully slow desktop computer, pottering around the house searching for\
  \ the mouse. He looked close to tears himself, offering heartbroken apologies for\
  \ the drama occurring under his roof, and I felt my anger melt away.\nThe last thing\
  \ I expected, sitting in an unfamiliar house with most of my physical links to home\
  \ ripped out from under me, was a feeling of gratitude. Kind faces were always free."
