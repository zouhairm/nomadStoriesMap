Text: "\u201CThey told me not to visit this country. Not solo at least. I should really\
  \ have listened to them\u201D, I think to myself walking my way through the canyon\
  \ trail. He had said it is a medium level hike, but the winter chill is not helping\
  \ and on top of that my growling stomach.\n\nI look around, there is no one in sight.\
  \ Except vast desert and shrubs. I sat on a big rock, take out the small piece of\
  \ cake and packet of juice. Sallah, the driver, had handed the snack pack to me\
  \ \u201C Here, it is a 40 min long hike you might need a snack. I have all your\
  \ stuff. Will see you on the other side\u201D before I could say anything he joked\
  \ \u201Cor not! Hahahha\u201D. I hope it was really just a joke \u201Cwhat if it\
  \ was not?\u201D\n\nI tried dismissing the thought and continue to sip on the juice\
  \ and stare at the Sky. The mighty blue of nothingness, unpolluted as ever. And\
  \ I, tensed as ever. A chilly wind brush past my hand, almost could not feel them.\
  \ \u201CI should have taken the gloves out of my bag\u201D \u201Coh, shit!\u201D\
  \ I turn scarlet as I rummage through my sling hoping to find my passport. Almost\
  \ skipped a beat, it was there,\u201CSigh!\u201D But all my stuff was in Sallah\u2019\
  s jeep, all of it.\n\nI decided to go on with the trail, occasionally checking my\
  \ phone for any signal. But who was I fooling? I was somewhere in the 720 sq. km\
  \ desert. On my own. I check my phone one last time, \u201CIt has been 40 minutes,\
  \ I should be nearing the end of the trail.\u201D\n\nPanting I tried conquering\
  \ the big sand dune. As I reach the top, I saw Sallah, waving at me. Abdul, his\
  \ help, was at the end of the dune, he screamed something in his language. I had\
  \ no idea what he said. But my happiness knew no bounds! Next I know, Abdul was\
  \ climbing towards me with a sand-board. He handed it to me along with his gloves.\n\
  \n6 seconds, a few scratches and tonnes of sand in my shoe later I had conquered\
  \ the sand dune. \u201CWhat took you so long? Come on, we have lunch and tea ready\u201D\
  \ Sallah said pointing at the spread of food. A few more Bedouins joined us.\n\n\
  There was still no one in sight, no signal on my cell-phone all I had was company\
  \ of 6 strange men in the middle of a desert. And the only thought that crossed\
  \ my mind \u201CThey were wrong, I knew this would be worth it. This would be fun.\u201D\
  \n\nOne of the Bedouins refilled my cup and said  \u201CYou know Sallah is the best\
  \ host around here.\u201D \u201CI know!\u201D I said, sipping on my 4th cup of the\
  \ famous Bedouin tea. Looking towards the sky, only this time content as ever."
