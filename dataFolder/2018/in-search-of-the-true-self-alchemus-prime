Text: "In January of 2015, I traveled from Fiji to Ecuador. On the way, having missed\
  \ two flights and barely made it onto my third plane, I met a stranger who inspired\
  \ me immensely. Like me, he wasn't supposed to be there, at least not in the seat\
  \ next to me. When I first saw him, there was a spark. Something about his ginger\
  \ hair under his suave beret, and his pensive blue eyes caught my attention. \n\n\
  As we talked, we found we couldn't stop. I learned he consults with clients to help\
  \ them balance their masculine and feminine energies, something I believe is crucial\
  \ for the future we are co-creating. At 30,000 feet, while traveling toward a new\
  \ sunrise from LA to Miami, he and I bonded over many topics; one of them was books.\
  \ Later, we wrote lists of the books that changed our lives. One of the books on\
  \ his list caught my eye: The Alchemist, by Paul Coelho. \n\nI was struck by the\
  \ fact that I hadn\u2019t yet read this incredibly famous book. I immediately purchased\
  \ it and read it in one sitting. The all-over-my-body-goosebumps came, and stayed\u2026\
  \ Soon after this experience, it was time to go on  a personal retreat to birth\
  \ my new venture. I was so inspired by The Alchemist that I chose the desert as\
  \ my retreat venue; I went to Joshua Tree National Park.\n\nThere, after a couple\
  \ of days of intense brainstorming and visioning, I went for my first sound bath\
  \ at the Integratron, which looks like a little half-dome spaceship in the middle\
  \ of nowhere. I felt a spaciousness arise in my brain. I went to the national park,\
  \ where I wandered, communing with teeming life in the vast desert. Inspired by\
  \ the Joshua trees, I returned to my work, now generating ideas for company names.\
  \ After my chart paper was full of more than two hundred ideas, something came:\
  \ \u201CAlchemist Prime.\u201D\n\nThis name encapsulated what I wanted to give my\
  \ future clients: collaborative leadership at its prime. And, the name resonated\
  \ with the way I had already named my blog (Integritus Prime), after my hero and\
  \ leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime.\n\nA week later we realized, much to my\
  \ effervescent delight, I learned that Alchemist Prime is an actual Transformer\
  \ who looks to nature for inspiration! The same day, during one of my meditations,\
  \ a new company name came to me, which was even more in line with Optimus Prime:\
  \ Alchemus Prime. \n\nA serendipitous connection with a stranger on a plane led\
  \ to articulating the essence of my company's name and purpose. Life continues to\
  \ support my mission. I have never looked back."
