Text: "I was addicted to moving on\u2014addicted to incomplete connections\u2014addicted\
  \ to the withdrawal of a possibility and the longing for that possibility. And so,\
  \ I fell in love with the unattainable: the man I met passing through airport security\
  \ I\u2019d likely never see again, the sex addict I\u2019d never satisfy, the steadfast\
  \ atheist who would never pray with me, the adventurous narcissist for whom I\u2019\
  d never be a priority, the man with a vasectomy who didn\u2019t want the child I\
  \ desired, the depressed man who\u2019d never be able to love me because he couldn't\
  \ love himself. A friend once told me, \"The more I got to know him, the more I\
  \ fell in love with London.\" I fell in love with unavailable men because of what\
  \ they represented for me: a place, a time, a death, a creation, an event. He\u2019\
  d been a romantic weekend in Paris, the month my grandfather slowly slipped out\
  \ of my life, a garden patch we spent a season tending, a breathtaking concert on\
  \ a Colorado summer night. I traveled through men. I gathered passport stamps and\
  \ learned something with each new experience: a new band out of Portland, how to\
  \ move my lips native-like when speaking French, which fly to fish with in a fast\
  \ current, how crystals form in solar cells, when to adjust the sails, how to make\
  \ herbal liqueur, the similar roles played by both a strip club bouncer and a mountaineer\
  \ guide, and how to remove a bullet lodged in the chest of a young Detroit gang\
  \ member. T.S. Eliot said, \u201CWe shall not cease from exploration, and the end\
  \ of all exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the\
  \ first time.\u201D And yet, despite all my \u201Cpassport stamps,\u201D I didn't\
  \ know what \u201Chome\u201D felt like. I fell in love with the incomplete nature\
  \ of a relationship. I traveled to the Caribbean just long enough time to fall in\
  \ love with its seductive turquoise waters (and the man captaining the boat), yet\
  \ left before I could see something disturbing in those waters. I fell in love with\
  \ an ER doctor sitting next to me on a flight to San Diego the night of a full moon.\
  \ It\u2019s easier to fantasize about a place or a person when you have an incomplete\
  \ picture. And so I repeatedly returned to that highly addictive and unhealthy space\
  \ of \u201Cwhat if.\u201D And in that space I longed to be rescued from my own patterns.\
  \ But it was in connecting with the most local and yet most resistant person available\
  \ to me where I found solace: myself."
