Text: "When I push the doors of Quiebra Canto, an old salsa bar in Cartagena, Colombia,\
  \ I am far from guessing that the night will create a ripple effect. Eight years\
  \ and hundreds of franco-colombian letters later, I smile as I look back to my seventeen\
  \ year old self embarking on her first solo trip. \n\nIn spite of my posh friends\u2019\
  \ description of Quiebra Canto as a place not recommended to tourists, I find myself\
  \ walking up the stairs of the colonial edifice. The door flies open before I can\
  \ touch it. I catch the glimpse of a dress rushing down the stairs in a color flash.\
  \ I tiptoe in. Around me, old photos of dancers fill up the walls. The wood cracks\
  \ under my feet. Breathing in my excitement, I soak up the smell of sweaty palms\
  \ and spilled aguardiente. A rumba blasts out of the large windows into the star\
  \ speckled night. I settle in. \nSoon, I start to fear l\u2019ll die of shyness\
  \ before I can muster the strength to have a conversation with an actual human being.\
  \ When David asks me to dance, I have already considered going home a thousand times.\n\
  \nIt always takes someone to lead you into their world. It always takes a yes to\
  \ start a conversation\n\nWhen I met him, David\u2019s sophisticated manners contrasted\
  \ with a mischievous wit. He explained those were the \xAB\_sassy leftovers\_\xBB\
  \ from his \xAB\_rude\_\xBB upbringing. Working as a lawyer in Bogota, David was\
  \ born in Santiago de Cali, a city about a hundred kilometers away from the Pacific\
  \ Coast. Known by its nickname, Cali was as famous for her salsa champions as she\
  \ was infamous for her history of drug and violence. \n\nDavid advocated in favor\
  \ of a sustainable form of justice. One not done in gunfire and blood.\_Through\
  \ letters and e-mails, he told me about events as they unfolded. Writing down imposed\
  \ a slower pace. One where words matter because they open a window into a foreign\
  \ culture. Where individual stories weave into historical patterns. \n\nOne day,\
  \ a turning point was reached. From the comfort of my Paris room, I read tales about\
  \ a treaty between FARCs and the government that seemed too eery to be true. The\
  \ peace process was starting in Colombia. Higher stakes, higher hopes, tougher fights.\
  \ And however uncanny it might seem, I related, deeply. Because of the ripple effect\
  \ of Quiebra Canto.\n\nThis is what traveling does. It connects and contrasts perspectives.\
  \ It makes even the most remote event feel human. It makes us care. \nSo the next\
  \ time you get asked to dance, accept. You never know what might come out of it."
