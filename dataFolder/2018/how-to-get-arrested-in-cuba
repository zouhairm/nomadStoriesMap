Text: "I was among the first Americans to visit to Cuba in the last 60 years.  It\
  \ was like taking a step back in time. The 50's cars and the black and white photos\
  \ of \"El Che\" everywhere we turned seemed like I had entered a forgotten world.\n\
  \nI wanted to write about my experience but no one would allow me to record them.\
  \ Not even on paper. All the quotes from real Cubans were taken afterwards according\
  \ to my memory.\n\nThe interviews come from Florida International University professors\
  \ Sebastian Arcos, Frank Mora and Randy Pasta\xF1a.\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe Cuban\
  \ government maintains control by arresting anyone who threatens their regime; creating\
  \ a culture of fear. Since 2010, the number of arbitrary arrests performed by the\
  \ Cuban government has nearly quintupled.\n\nMy conversations with the taxi drivers\
  \ were eerily cookie cutter. If the government suspects anyone of dissidence, they\
  \ will arrest and detain them to discourage further opposition. Formally, they would\
  \ throw the dissident in jail for decades. Now the government performs short term\
  \ arrests of 24 to 48 hours to send the same message, while avoiding international\
  \ repercussions [Arcos, 2017].\n\nSocial & Cultural Effects\n\n\_\u201CPeople say\
  \ that Cuba is going to change, I don\u2019t think so. There are roots which are\
  \ embedded deep into the hearts of the people of Cuba, they have been indoctrinated.\u201D\
  \_\_Rodriguez\n\nThe government uses neighbors and family members as informants.\
  \ \u201CWhen I was 10, I would say anything that I thought. My grandmother and mother\
  \ would tell me to stop. In this country, it\u2019s all about conformity. You must\
  \ be careful who you talk to. Your own neighbor could report you\u201D [Javier,\
  \ 2017]. \n\n\u201CThe Committee of Defense of the Revolution is a neighborhood\
  \ watch program for vigilance by block. Neighbors hear and report each other. Children\
  \ would turn in their own mothers.\u201D\_Jos\xE9, 2017\n\nCuban culture in generally\
  \ open, the people talk and communicate freely sometimes \u201Con the streets until\
  \ 3 in the morning\u201D [Jos\xE9, 2017]. But if anything, concerning politics,\
  \ human rights, and especially communism is brought up the people instantly shut\
  \ down. The fear created by the arrests and detentions creates an atmosphere in\
  \ which you\u2019re afraid to talk to anyone--your neighbor, your family [Arcos,\
  \ 2017]. \n\nI was perfectly safe in my trip through time. No week has been as educational\
  \ and beautiful as stepping back into Old Havana."
