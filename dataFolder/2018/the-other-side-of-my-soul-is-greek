Text: "The summer, equally-distanced raindrops curtain that could fall for hour, without\
  \ ever stopping its force, was my background noise. We only had one withered copy\
  \ of Magus to share, so we would be reading an hour at a time. One side of my soul\
  \ was already hers, a child with everything, but an adult with nothing. I was 15\
  \ and in love with Greece.\n\nYears after, I travelled 36 hours of July in a bus\
  \ to Athens, with no air-conditioning or idea of how people eat lamb when it's not\
  \ Easter. It was hot, sweaty and all the land around seemed burnt to oblivion. But\
  \ at night, the cold, shattering water didn\u2019t stop us from swimming away from\
  \ the shore and breathing in the calmest and alluring air I had ever inhaled. It\
  \ was Marathon. I was starting college that year.\n\nA new life later, when the\
  \ oleander was still young, I went back. I lived for weeks, then travelled for days\
  \ and one of my 1 o'clock caught me on a cheap ferry ride to Spetses, the island\
  \ where Urfe learned the mind is a maze of sea and pins, little churches and secluded\
  \ beaches. When the last ferry leaves the island, it strikes you that this could\
  \ be a place so beautiful, quiet and empty that it verged on the terrifying. \n\n\
  The island refuses to be chained in the description of belonging to some British\
  \ author locals know nothing about, so I have to figure it out on my own. An old\
  \ man smoking on a terrace, cats swarming around like mice and a silence that would\
  \ freeze you like a vivid nightmare, if not for a feeling of ancient and mysterious\
  \ laying around. I walk for yards full of lemon trees after yards full of mandarins\
  \ after big white houses In the quietness of a winter afternoon when no tourists\
  \ ever come here. But you see, I am not a tourist, nor a seeker. I am a reader.\
  \ \n\nAt the end of the asphalt road, Aghia Marina is empty and the sea blasts furiously\
  \ at my feet. I stopped on a red-brick cape and lit a cigarette. The waves are deafening,\
  \ the storm has already blackened the sky, so I opened my Kindle and read Fowles.\
  \ I felt his solitude, his isolation and I envied him for that. For Greece is joyous,\
  \ colourful, but underneath, it might be rotten, angry and enigmatic and he got\
  \ to the core if it all: Greece teaches one not to live alone, but to live.\n\n\
  As I walked back, I looked up the hill and in the middle of all those old, crumpled\
  \ pages, I saw it: majestic and impenetrable. A villa that could have belonged to\
  \ anyone, but I chose it to be Conchis\u2019. That year I quit my job to travel."
