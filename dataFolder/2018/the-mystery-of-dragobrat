Text: "Dragobrat is definitely not the highest and probably even not the most beautiful\
  \ among the Carpathian Mountains. It\u2019s kind of an outsider. In a mysterious\
  \ way there\u2019s constantly raining and clouds are feeling themselves like a part\
  \ of the mountain. Thanks to these rains, numerous waterfalls and temporary rivers\
  \ are popping out from time to time in unexpected places. \nOf course all these\
  \ natural causes make Dragobrat almost impossible to climb despite its humble height.\
  \ And of course there is no adventurer to be stopped by such small misfortune. \n\
  At the time, I considered myself as one (an adventurer, not a misfortune). So I\
  \ picked Dragobrad as one of the first mountain to climb in my adventurers\u2019\
  \ life. \nThe nature itself, as usually, was against this trip. It wasn\u2019t just\
  \ raining. Water came from every possible and impossible direction. It\u2019s like\
  \ the washing machine gone mad. \nThe way up on Dragobrat is restricted in case\
  \ of the rain. But nobody was actually on control so we took our chances with a\
  \ local guy who introduced himself as a guide and it actually seemed like he doesn\u2019\
  t really mind if some of us falls down and never comes back.\nIn addition to the\
  \ wall of rain, which was waiting at the very beginning, the fog started to crawl\
  \ around us.  I have to say I use to think that this kind of fog exists only in\
  \ the horror movies. And now it\u2019s here \u2013 becoming different shapes and\
  \ even changing colors a bit. I swear if I stayed there a bit longer I would feel\
  \ its taste. \nWhen we climbed high enough to reach the first clouds we were seeing\
  \ only each other heads. The rain suddenly stopped. We were shattered by extreme\
  \ silence. But after few minutes we heard the water. And it surely wasn\u2019t the\
  \ rain. \nI asked our guide, is there a river or a waterfall somewhere. He said\
  \ that there is actually one, every season it pops up in different places, because\
  \ of the rain and little earthquakes. But nobody knows where it\u2019s going to\
  \ be the next time. \nJust as he said this, I stepped out the way and steam of dirt\
  \ and water almost flashed me down. \u201COh, well, you found it\u201D, said the\
  \ guide. \nI save myself by grabbing the branch of tree.  \nThis humble 1500 km\
  \ seemed like Mont Blanc. \nEventually, totally wet, exhausted and angry I managed\
  \ it. \nThere were no rain, no clouds, no fog, no wind.  Instead I stared at around\
  \ twenty people with children who were sunbathing and swimming in the hot lake on\
  \ top. \nAnd they had cars there. \n\u201CYou\u2019ve never asked\u201D \u2013 said\
  \ my guide answering to my confusing look."
