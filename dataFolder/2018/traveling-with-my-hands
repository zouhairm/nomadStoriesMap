Text: "This is the story of my life, a single soul that is every day at the edge.\
  \ Nothing is sure for me. I don\u2019t have money, neither a house, sometimes I\
  \ have some friends, but they never lasts and my family is far away. But I never\
  \ fall, I am always walking on a tightrope.\nIt is my choice, traveling full time\
  \ alone with some bracelets to sell, made by my hands, which tell me If I will eat\
  \ or sleep under a roof. On one hand there is luck, on the other just the desire\
  \ of knowing the world.\nI could never find a balance between safety and freedom,\
  \ five years walking without stopping, sleeping every day in a different place.Where\
  \ will I be next week? That\u2019s is always a surprise.\n\nThis story begins ten\
  \ years ago, when I didn\u2019t know about life, I got lost with a Peruvian guy,\
  \ that invited me to hitchhike; we crossed the desert and we arrived to the door\
  \ of the jungle in the Peruvian Amazon. He went to juggle in the traffic lights,\
  \ I took his clown nose and I said \u201CI will go with you\u201D. With my young\
  \ energy I jumped and shared happiness to everybody, people stopped all around,\
  \ watching from the windows, the terrace and the street., kids were screaming. After\
  \ two hours I was tired and the money was enough to eat in any restaurant we chose\
  \ and to live a few more days. \nI could live traveling. I never knew how far I\
  \ will get, but the idea was growing fast in my brain.\n\nI went to travel for a\
  \ year around South America, during which I learned to work, playing a drum, juggling\
  \ and selling handicrafts in the street. Sometimes without anything to eat, sometimes\
  \ with money to go to a fancy restaurant and to sleep in a private room with hot\
  \ water. Somedays I woke up without a penny for a bread, with sleep in my eyes and\
  \ walking like a zombie to work and earn some coins for the breakfast, but the most\
  \ important fortune of all was the freedom, a permanent luxury.\nI travelled in\
  \ Colombia for two years, going to the most dangerous places of my country, dancing,\
  \ playing music and juggling, to share with the forgotten communities. Where nobody\
  \ goes by fear to the danger.\nI went where everybody said don't go, to Central\
  \ America and Mexico, to Europe without money, to the feared Turkey and finally\
  \ the most threatening place for a woman alone: Egypt. Arriving like a strong woman\
  \ to those countries where the women are hidden behind scarves and dresses, where\
  \ they cannot talk in the street, or go far from home. Awesome, I survived, enjoyed,\
  \ learned and I am sure my edge is now further away."
