Text: "The rain was hitting my back like a flesh drum, hitting and caressing its bent\
  \ surface. I adjusted the hood of the k-way down to the nose, and a blue curtain\
  \ fell on my sight. The van\u2019s engine was sputtering nearby, complaining after\
  \ the prolonged journey on the coast. I looked back. The rear of the Dyrh\xF3laey\
  \ lighthouse was popping out of the sea mist as if hanging out of space and time.\
  \ Its thick, white walls were standing firmly, guarding the cliffs that leaped into\
  \ the roaring waves. My freezing lashes and ringing ears were begging me for protection,\
  \ and I crunched on the soaked moss. I could hear the elements howling above my\
  \ head, inviting me to open my eyes back. I began to worry, slightly. I never thought\
  \ I could find the roots of my own existence, as a human being, in a specific place.\
  \ So far from home, too. \nThe black eye of the lighthouse was staring lazily in\
  \ the distance. In the back, humongous glaciers and silent volcanoes stood still.\
  \ Iceland is ancient, and vividly gaunt. When Vikings set foot on it, more than\
  \ ten centuries ago, the land was deserted and they took it. A marvellously fertile\
  \ spot in the middle of the great sea. They cut almost every tree to build houses\
  \ and boats, leaving its naked ground exposed to the elements. Nothing had changed:\
  \ the earth, extending for kilometres beyond my sight, green as Eden and flat as\
  \ the horizon, had been the same ever since, witnessing the passing centuries.\n\
  This was Iceland\u2019s renowned beauty. When I landed in Keflavik a week earlier\
  \ in the dead of night, I had such fear of it. It easily risked turning out to be\
  \ a clich\xE9. Been there, done that, got the t-shirt.\nAll had changed: I was there\
  \ watching the sea hit the black sand for eternity, the earth involving me in that\
  \ undying metamorphosis. I could finally see the bigger secret lying behind that\
  \ sight. A woman. A cold-faced woman with a rocky heart, bursting with magma. The\
  \ green eyes revealed a frothing consciousness, both young and incredibly old. Her\
  \ black skin was fertile, a home for many. I breathed in again, as if to shake her\
  \ hand. She hugged me instead. I confused my body with hers, in the stream of time.\n\
  A sudden honk shook me back to reality. Jan was waving his hand to gather us. Almost\
  \ slipping, I turned my back to the cliff, hanging onto the camera under the k-way.\
  \ Even though projecting myself on the approaching supper, I could feel one last\
  \ glance searching my soul, waiting for me to drop a shard of my heart. And I did."
