Text: "PROJECT PROPOSAL  \nAccording to given information of UNO (United Nations Organization)\
  \ there are more than 200 different countries with their own spiritual and material\
  \ culture. And only the nation can be the keeper of that culture. Taking part in\
  \ different kinds of projects of Public Fund \u201CThe Resources for progresses\
  \ of the youth\u201D we can learn deeper about Kyrgyz nation, its history and culture.\
  \ At the same time we are trying to spread out and share this knowledge to the wide\
  \ public via books, films, etc.  \nThe Public Fund \u201CThe Resources for progresses\
  \ of the youth\u201D since 2005 is implemented various international, educational\
  \ and cultural programs on the territory of Kyrgyz Republic. \nDuring 2013-2016\
  \ years, I participated in preparing and publishing encyclopedia \"My homeland -\
  \ Kyrgyzstan\" in several languages. This book contains information on traditional\
  \ knowledge of Kyrgyz people. In the process of writing a book have been identified\
  \ and researched interesting facts on the subject, which in summary form is included\
  \ in the book. It was fascinating adventure of the time for me, through the history.\
  \ Various sources say that in former times (15000 years ago) was a migration of\
  \ peoples from Asia to America across the Bering Strait. Pretum (nomad of the seas)\
  \ left their \u201Cmarks\u201D as in pre-Columbian America and the images of American\
  \ plants in the mural towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii, as reported by Italian researcher\
  \ Dominica Casella. For example, this book describes the presence of identical parts\
  \ in clothing and languages of ancient Kyrgyz and Etruscan. \nNowadays one of the\
  \ promising techniques to decode ancient inscriptions is the CECAPF method (consecutive\
  \ etymological and combinatorial approximation with phonetic feedback) proposed\
  \ as long ago as 1980 by F.R. Latypov, an etruscologist from the city of Ufa (Russia).\
  \   \nIn 1981 using the CECAPF method and phonoevolutional Parent Turkic hypothesis\
  \ (with an assumption that the Turkic language family had its origin during the\
  \ 4th millennium BC on the basis of linguistic traditions of the Ubaid culture in\
  \ the ancient Middle East), F.R. Latypov translated two thirds of the longest extant\
  \ Etruscan text  TLE 1 written in black and red ink on the linen wrappings of the\
  \ Zagreb mummy.  It was found that the text in question is devoted to the ritual\
  \ of human sacrifice and describes participants, sacrifice tools, embalming chemicals,\
  \ surroundings and goals of the ceremony."
