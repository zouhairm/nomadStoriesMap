Text: "At the tip of God\u2019s thumb, parallel with the tree tops, my surroundings\
  \ became worth every bit of the struggle in my breathing. Finally I was at the foot\
  \ of peace. Mariana, also grasping for air, yells out, \u201CIt wasn\u2019t that\
  \ bad, now was it?\u201D The difference between her and I was that scaling this\
  \ mountain was of her roots, and commonplace. These alluring views were just another\
  \ feature of her home. She looked over at me and, without having to ask, she could\
  \ tell I had never seen anything close to this beauty. I walked slightly closer\
  \ to the edge of the mountain and closed my eyes. As I stood in the center of where\
  \ the sun was shining, the rays pierced my soul, and for the first time in my life\
  \ I felt the true feeling of gratitude. \u201CChanel! Don\u2019t fall asleep on\
  \ me\u201D Mariana poked. I opened my eyes and smiled. I had no words. It was as\
  \ if my dialogue ran off with the wind and my thoughts got mixed with the gentle\
  \ undertones of the sky. Mariana grabbed my hand and spoke out \u201CWait until\
  \ you see what\u2019s next.\u201D \n\nEl Yunque was the first rainforest I had ever\
  \ experienced outside of the firm front cover of a National Geographic magazine.\
  \ The greenery was miraculous - much more vibrant and delicate than the plants in\
  \ the states. The flowers were as outlandish as the natives and in that moment I\
  \ couldn\u2019t believe that the same creator who sculpted myself was responsible\
  \ for this earthy masterpiece. \n\nSeparated from the bustling mainland by a deep\
  \ turquoise sea, the isolated island of Culebra, also known as Flamenco Beach reserves\
  \ its beauty for travelers determined to brave a small prop-plane or an hour long\
  \ ferry to reach its shores. Flamenco is sought after due to it\u2019s an incomparable\
  \ charm and lauded as the second most beautiful beach in the world. As I stepped\
  \ out onto the sun-kissed sand, which was so white it could have comprised entirely\
  \ of fine grains of diamonds, I realized the picturesque views were more than just\
  \ the peaks. \u201CNow this is the kind of place you fall asleep at\u201D Mariana\
  \ kids. \u201CThese waves have been rocking me to sleep since I can remember.\u201D\
  \ The two of us sunk our bodies into the shallow crystal waters and embraced the\
  \ echoes of the ocean as they soothed our bones. To believe that such unparalleled\
  \ beauty would one day be razed from the earth.\n\n\u201CHurricane Maria was a natural\
  \ catastrophe. The aftermath in Puerto Rico has become a man-made disaster, with\
  \ a death toll threatening to eclipse Katrina\u2019s.\u201D - NYMag\n\nWhere there\
  \ once was, there is no more."
