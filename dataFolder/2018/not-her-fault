Text: "Standing on the balcony of the travelers\u2019 hostel, I inhaled what felt\
  \ like freedom and smiled at the dried up anxiety in my clenched palms. It was my\
  \ first solo trip. In the streets below, the city was frozen in time, with hawkers\
  \ selling artifacts of the era bygone, and tourists haggling for the over-priced\
  \ leather bags. Somewhere at a distance, the evening prayers were beginning with\
  \ the temple bells and hymns. I was at peace.\nI heard a laughter from right behind\
  \ me and turned around. \u201CI love this Bollywood song, la la la\u2026\u201D She\
  \ hummed the music of a catchy Bollywood movie she had recently seen at a theater\
  \ in Rajasthan, India. Her eyes were gleaming with excitement of having just watched\
  \ an entertaining film amidst a lively audience. \u201CIt isn\u2019t this much fun\
  \ back home\u201D, she complained about the stark opposite movie theater experience\
  \ of London. That is where I met Rebecca for the first time.\nSoon we were like\
  \ long lost friends, chatting non-stop and hysterically laughing at our internal\
  \ jokes. Rebecca was on a break from her studies and had been travelling through\
  \ India for the past 3 months. She recounted how the Golden Temple of Amritsar was\
  \ surreal and the food she had at langar, the Temple community kitchen, was unbelievably\
  \ scrumptious. She was in love with the spicy Indian food and was eager to learn\
  \ some cooking. So I promised to teach her a bit at the hostel kitchen later. \n\
  She had a bag full of travel stories for the cooking session and I was all ears.\
  \ She gave a very descriptive account of her tour from Amritsar to Ajmer and finally\
  \ here at Udaipur. Then she recounted her visit to the famous 'Jallianwala Bagh\
  \ Memorial' at Amritsar. The Sandstone memorial stands tall amongst the seven acre\
  \ Bagh or park, reminding of the massacre that took place a hundred years ago, killing\
  \ thousands of unsuspecting commoners celebrating Baisakhi, an annual harvest festival,\
  \ on the orders of Colonel Dyer, an officer of the British Indian Army. She told\
  \ me how the local guides narrated the horrific story of a tank blocking the gates\
  \ and army men firing blindly at men, women and children alike for 10 long minutes.\
  \ How atrocious the British were to the Indians during their 300 years of rule!\
  \ [sic] I could sense an apologetic sadness creeping into her voice. Her eyes still\
  \ gleaming, but this time it was with guilt. She said, \u201Cthen the guide asked\
  \ me where I was from, and I couldn\u2019t bring myself to say I too was a British,\
  \ instead I said I was from France.\u201D"
