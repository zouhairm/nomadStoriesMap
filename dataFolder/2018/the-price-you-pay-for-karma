Text: "There is one image permanently emblazoned in my mind that captures the extreme\
  \ nature of Varanasi. After a gut-wrenching rickshaw ride through its crowded, dusty\
  \ streets, I was eager to catch my first glimpse of the Ganges. I made my way down\
  \ a colorfully painted ghat. It was almost sundown and the mystic river glimmered\
  \ before me. I removed my sandals and let my feet sink into the warm sand. I closed\
  \ my eyes and inhaled deeply.\n\nSuddenly, my nostrils were assaulted with an awful\
  \ smell of decay. I looked around frantically to find the source. There in the sand,\
  \ just a few feet away, was a decomposing human skull. Chunks of sinew were still\
  \ attached to the severed jaw, and bits of hair clung to the temples. Ironically,\
  \ next to that rotting skull was a beautiful, brightly colored sari. The juxtaposition\
  \ of these two items perfectly illustrated the omnipresent themes of Varanasi: life\
  \ and death.\n\nIn the Hindu religion, people surrender all material items before\
  \ they go on to the next realm. Yet in this world, money and worldly possessions\
  \ are still essential for survival. Spirituality comes with a price. Tour guides\
  \ roam the alleys and boatmen flock on the shore, all offering the best view of\
  \ the Aarti ceremony. Hordes of children sell offerings of marigolds. Men in slick\
  \ suits tout ringside seats at crematoriums. Solemn women solicit donations for\
  \ orphanages, all in exchange for good karma.\n\nWalking along the Ganges, my friends\
  \ and I were swarmed by people seeking money. We shooed small children and elderly\
  \ men away. I felt guilty. I wanted to give, but it was impossible to help everybody.\
  \ In my head, I attempted to compute my karmic balance and was pretty sure I came\
  \ up short.\n\nLater that night, we crammed into the back of a shoddy rickshaw.\
  \ As we pedaled down the street, all of us, including our driver, were distracted\
  \ by a boisterous wedding procession nearby. I leaned out to get a better view.\
  \ The rickshaw behind us crashed into ours and I was catapulted into the air, landing\
  \ smack dab in the middle of the ceremony. \n\nIn an overpopulated city like Varanasi,\
  \ it is easy to go unnoticed in a sea of people. I feared I would be stampeded by\
  \ cows or run over by another careless driver. To my surprise, a crowd of people\
  \ came to my rescue. A man helped me to my feet. My elbow was cut and bleeding,\
  \ but my faith in Varanasi had been restored. The second I found myself down \u2013\
  \ literally \u2014 I was uplifted by some very kind souls. Now that is good karma."
