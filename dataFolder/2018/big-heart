Text: "Poland? A country still hungover from Communism? Haha. WRONG!\nPoles are indulged\
  \ in alcohol 24/7? Guess again.\nPoland is a right wing 'white supremacist' nation\
  \ which doesn't welcome foreigners? Please.\n\nMy 6 week journey in Poland panned\
  \ out as a beautiful, life changing one. \n54 applicants were chosen through intense\
  \ scrutiny from a pool of 2800; each possessing their own unique stories that I\
  \ would start learning as soon as this programme started. \n\nArriving with an open\
  \ mind, I was welcomed by 3 incredibly beautiful Poles; 1 of which was the project\
  \ manager and would become a great friend. I was dropped off at a pre-booked hostel:\
  \ where I shared a room with people from Egypt, Turkey, Kyrgyzstan, Algeria, India\
  \ and Pakistan. I would later become friends with people from all over the world,\
  \ but nothing came close to befriending the local Polish people.\n\nWeek 1 started\
  \ with a middle aged woman picking us up: and she was a bit 'too nice', if you know\
  \ what I mean. Now, I'm a bit of a smart ass, so I realised that this can be one\
  \ of 2 scenarios: there's something shady going on or she is genuinely amazing.\
  \ As time passed, I realised that it was the latter: she turned out to be the most\
  \ amazing woman I had ever met! Now here's a woman belonging to the privileged middle\
  \ class, telling us that I am your driver for the amount of time that you are working\
  \ for me. Astonishing, right?  She was to visit a friend out of town for the weekend,\
  \ and wanted to give us the keys to her home and said \"you can do everything; just\
  \ don't burn down my home\". Unfortunately i couldn't take up that offer, as I had\
  \ already planned a weekend trip to Prague. \nShe didn't have a family, so we just\
  \ referred to her as out 'host mother'. \nComing to the work side: it was a cultural\
  \ volunteer programme. So we basically went to local summer schools and presented\
  \ our culture to the Polish youth. Volunteering in these schools was mind blowing\
  \ as well: mainly because of the love and respect that both fellow teachers and\
  \ students gave. The teachers, or co-workers would hang out with us after school\
  \ every day showing either entertaining us or showing us something new. There was\
  \ always a home cooked meal during the day; and it was always amazing.\n\nThe small\
  \ amount of Polish people that I had interactions with were amazing. I could go\
  \ on and on about my interactions with the local Polish people. But no matter what\
  \ I write, nothing will do justice to the experiences I had during the course of\
  \ the summer."
