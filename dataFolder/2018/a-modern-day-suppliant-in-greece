Text: "The day promised to end well. I had handled all the logistical issues and was\
  \ quietly enjoying my mixed baklava plate on a terrace overlooking the Nafplio Bay.\
  \ I wondered how to capture just the right picture of a sunset over Bourtzi Island,\
  \ which was turning the same color and gooeyness as the honey oozing from my now\
  \ empty plate. I had 15 minutes left before I was to meet the study abroad student\
  \ group that I was leading, and we would all be heading out by bus for an evening\
  \ performance in the ancient theater of Epidaurus. We had been reading the classical\
  \ tragedy in advance: Euripides\u2019 Suppliants. Also, I had told my students about\
  \ the spectacular theater structure, the actors and the chorus, the costumes, but\
  \ most of all, about the pristine setting of this theater where, when the lights\
  \ dim, nothing human-made ever shows and the distance between the 21st century and\
  \ the 4th century BCE simply vanishes.\nBut until the time of our departure, quiet,\
  \ except for the noisy Greek bus driver who had almost pushed me off the road when\
  \ I was walking over to the outdoor caf\xE9 for my well-deserved break. He was now\
  \ subjecting everyone near him to his tales of tourist encounters\u2014and near-misses,\
  \ no doubt!\nWith 5 minutes to spare, I thought I\u2019d better check on the arrival\
  \ of the bus that would take us on the hour-long drive over rural roads from Nafplio\
  \ to Epidaurus. No bus to be seen. Ten, twenty minutes passed, painfully slowly.\
  \ Still no bus. By now, my face had turned as dark and looming as the towering Palamidi\
  \ Castle behind me. I was, I am responsible for transporting 25 people to Epidaurus\
  \ and I have no budget to order taxis or... Where\u2019s that bus?! Panic.\nSuddenly,\
  \ a tourist coach appears, only half-full. I rush up to the driver, only to find\
  \ out that he is the one who nearly took me out earlier\u2026 \u201CThink honey,\
  \ think baklava,\u201D I tell myself. I politely ask him if he, per chance, has\
  \ room for another 25 people, given that we\u2019re all likely headed for the same\
  \ destination. Epidaurus, right? The play performance, right? He looks at me, surprised.\
  \ Can desperation speak for itself, without words? Are the Suppliants pleading with\
  \ me now? Or is this a gentle Greek guy, after all, trying to make it up to me?\
  \ Without much fanfare, Yiorgos says yes! That\u2019s his name. I find out just\
  \ now. I rush my people onto the bus and off we go. We made it, 15 fashionable minutes\
  \ late. That is, on time, in this country where the personal is always possible."
