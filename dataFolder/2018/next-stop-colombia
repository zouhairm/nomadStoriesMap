Text: "The sweltering heat hit me before I'd even made it through customs. This was\
  \ Panama. This was about as close as I would ever be to visiting Jurassic Park.\
  \ While I knew that Panama would be hot and muggy, think a 75,000 square kilometre\
  \ sauna, imagination is one thing but reality is another. I knew I would be doing\
  \ a lot of hiking so I packed for the occasion. Practical clothing, minimal safety\
  \ equipment, and nothing that I though I could buy in Panama. Something that I always\
  \ pack when I know I will be doing a lot of walking is Gold Bond body powder, as\
  \ I can go through it like water. The first couple of days were spent acclimating\
  \ and preparing for spending some time with the Embera tribe. I knew I would be\
  \ staying with them for a week and I was mentally decluttering and preparing for\
  \ a great time with minimal technology and maximum immersion in another culture.\
  \ \n\nMy stay with the Embera tribe was eye opening and enlightening. It's sobering\
  \ to see that the less you have, the happier you truly are, and that the world keeps\
  \ spinning even if you don't refresh your Facebook feed for a couple of days. I\
  \ was fortunate enough to go on a hike with the Embera men up into the mountains\
  \ and help carry, yes carry, down a 30 foot canoe that they had carved out of tree.\
  \ The next day, the group I was travelling with spent most of the day floating in\
  \ the river and recovering, while the Embera men sat around and made fun of us.\
  \ I was particularly happy to find that even in the middle of the jungle, Coca Cola\
  \ had still managed to make an appearance. To this very day, it was the best can\
  \ I've ever had. That night as we were all heading to bed, the men told us of another\
  \ canoe that needed to be carried down. Thinking that it was a joke, we agreed.\
  \ It was not a joke.\n\nSaying our goodbyes was bittersweet as the experience had\
  \ brought us all closer together and we were able to bond with the tribes people.\
  \ As we packed, I double checked that I had everything that I had brought, especially\
  \ my Gold Bond. I would need it for part of the hike out. I applied it liberally\
  \ and then put it back in my bag. They wrapped our bags in plastic and I didn't\
  \ think anything more of it until we got to the airport and unloaded. It was then\
  \ that I noticed a white powder around the zipper on my bag. My Gold Bond was not\
  \ closed properly and had leaked all through my bag. There's no experience like\
  \ heading into customs in Central America with white powder covering mostly everything\
  \ in your bag."
