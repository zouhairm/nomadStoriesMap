Text: "In the middle of the card game we were all playing with such novelty, as if\
  \ it was the first time, (yet in realty we would play these card games at least\
  \ 10 times a day) Jessica tapped me on the shoulder a couple of times and asked\
  \ me humbly and softly if I was busy. \u201Csome people want ta see you, by the\
  \ ttree\u201D she explained in her Guyanese accent. It was an unexpected and curious\
  \ notice to receive. As I approached the tree, I see Jess, Hannah and two local\
  \ Indigenous Amerindian ladies sat on the wooden plank that was elevated to make\
  \ a bench, in the darkness of our campsite. I then realised, that they had earlier\
  \ promised to sing some traditional Makushi songs for us. Makushi wasn\u2019t just\
  \ a language they spoke, it wasn\u2019t just the tribe they were from, makushi was\
  \ their existence.\nThe constant night sounds of the forest had become a humming\
  \ wave in the background.\nSo we sat gathered around with little lighting but from\
  \ the head torches of the research students and scientists in the near distance,\
  \ either playing cards in the hut or looking over data we had collected earlier\
  \ from the transects we had made into the forest. The moon seemed to have joined\
  \ us too in our gathering. \nThe two women introduced their first song they called\
  \ the \u2018welcome\u2019 song. Shyly, and softly they started their melody. One\
  \ lady started and the other joined in almost in sync with each other, each echoing\
  \ and cuddling the other with their warm but lively tones, it was intertwined, it\
  \ felt like a lullaby. Their small act of generosity and sharing a part of them.\
  \ I felt so privileged to have been presented with such a gift. I knew how special\
  \ it was \u2026 my heart was glowing like a fire fly, growing in light and defusing\
  \ softly and then again growing.\nI didn\u2019t know what they were saying, but\
  \ it was human, it was soul, it was laughter, it was raw and authentic. \n\u201C\
  Surama sitting in the valley, surrama you make me so happy\u201D they began another\
  \ song.\nWith each song there would be light hearted jokes from the other makushi\
  \ friends that had joined us. Each timely pitching in about the stories being told.\
  \ Moments of laughter would flood in the middle of a song because they forgot the\
  \ words, but they continued.\nIt felt like family, it felt like home.\n\u201CSurama\
  \ my dear dear home\u201D\nI felt closer to these people I had become friends with\
  \ more than some from my own country, not because we had a common ground but because\
  \ I felt a connection. Something I will never forget."
