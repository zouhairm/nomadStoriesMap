Text: "I am waiting, as everyone always do in Cuba. I\u2019m stuck here in Cabaigu\xE1\
  n, sitting on a concrete wall along the main State road. I am the only foreigner\
  \ in a long line of Cubans. We\u2019re all waiting for an \u2018almendr\xF3n\u2019\
  , a \u2018big almond\u2019, as they call here the old curvy American wrecks from\
  \ the 50\u2019s. They work as shared cabs, going randomly from village to village.\
  \ But today is Sunday and just a few of them are on the road. I am wondering if\
  \ I\u2019ll make my way till Santa Clara, when I realize that a smoky beat-up car\
  \ has just stopped in front of us. The driver gets out, takes off his mirrored sunglasses\
  \ and starts shouting his next stop: \u2018Placetas! Placetas!\u2019 It\u2019s my\
  \ destination, I have to get a seat. I am still bargaining a price with the driver\
  \ when my backpack is taken and fitted into the trunk, and in no time I find myself\
  \ sitting in the rear seat between a young couple and a sweat man with a straw hat.\
  \ \nAs we get out of the town I see a small mouth yawning from my neighbor\u2019\
  s legs. A lovely tiny black puppy with hairy ears is laying on her knees.\n\u2018\
  What\u2019s its name?\u2019 I ask.\n\u2018Pelita. And yours? Why do you speak Spanish?\u2019\
  \ This is how Cubans can be direct in approaching a stranger, and this young woman\
  \ with deep dark eyes makes no exception.\n\u2018My name\u2019s Marco, I am Italian\
  \ and Spanish is pretty similar to my mother language.\u2019 In five minutes Ana\
  \ takes me in a long conversation about dogs, food and coffee. She asks me why I\
  \ am traveling by \u2018almendr\xF3n\u2019, like a Cuban. In fact I could have booked\
  \ an air conditioned bus instead of sweating in this rusty hot carriage, which rolls\
  \ onto the unpredictable Cuban asphalt.\nI explain I wanted to see the country from\
  \ the Cuban\u2019s point of view. Her astonishment opens up in an \u2018En s\xE9\
  rio?\u2019, \u2018Seriously?\u2019 Ana insists with her questions, she wants to\
  \ know if Cuba is really as beautiful as tourists say. I realize how this is an\
  \ obvious question from someone who could never leave the country and was educated\
  \ in a self-referential socialist system.\n\u2018Yes, trust me. It\u2019s beautiful\u2019\
  . As I am answering I realize how it\u2019s almost impossible to find a specific\
  \ reason to explain this beauty, and I give up in working out a good one.\nThe reggaeton\
  \ music from the dashboard is filling the air of deep basses, while a dry landscape\
  \ runs out of the windows in the trembling hot air of this Cuban afternoon. Probably\
  \ the answer to Ana\u2019s question is everywhere around here, suspended between\
  \ the smell of diesel, Pelita, and the dusty cloud of noise behind us."
