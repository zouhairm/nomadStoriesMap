Text: "When once you have tasted flight, \nyou will forever walk the earth \nwith\
  \ your eyes turned skyward, \nfor there you have been, \nand there you will always\
  \ ...\n                                         Richard Bach\nWhose arrow that flies\
  \ today, \nhas sent me to the top of the unknown?\n                            \
  \             Luis Jorge Borges\n\nSo, our expedition was heading to the endless\
  \ deserts of Patagonia.\nWe walked along the glaciers and approached the Iguazu\
  \ Falls. In the morning, it was planned to climb Aconcagua. We went to swim with\
  \ fur seals and whales, watch the birds in the \xABAmerican Serengeti\xBB.\nFresh\
  \ morning. we are on the side of a great mountain. We rise uphill more and more.\
  \ The confusion of the seasons. We stopped at the shore of the lake, admiring the\
  \ scenery. Abruptly voices were heard. Stepping aside, passed a small detachment\
  \ of wild animals. Among them were lamas, vicunas, capybaras.\nThe plain shines\
  \ with diamonds, the pale dawn burns out on the horizon. Soon the moon will rise,\
  \ illuminate the mysterious light of the whole neighborhood.\nHigh in the sky over\
  \ the Andes, a condor hovers. And suddenly a heavy rumble is heard. To the black\
  \ cloud, smaller clouds join. A fiery thread of silver lightning flashed. The first\
  \ drops of rain fell on the grass\u2026\nAhead is possible, prairies, Niagara, Pamukkale,\
  \ Karlovy Vary, the ruins of the ancient city, lake Baikal, the Carpathians.\nBut\
  \ while my heart belongs to the \xABSilver Country\xBB.\nThe decision that pushed\
  \ me to the edge of the earth is a civil position.\nApril 22 - International Mother\
  \ Earth Day.\nIn the worldview of the inhabitants of a number of countries there\
  \ is a cult of Mother Earth, or Pachamama, as it is called in Latin America.\nThe\
  \ Earth and its ecosystems are our home, and people are closely connected with nature\
  \ - mountains, forests, rivers, living beings, inhabiting the planet.\nA person\
  \ can create, can destroy. A person is unique, he can develop, improve. But its\
  \ most important task is to fight not with the surrounding world, but with oneself.\n\
  Mankind must take knowledge of nature and unite them into a coherent system for\
  \ developing a picture of the world through which man could honor nature because\
  \ nature is worthy of reverence.\nThe Dalai Lama was right when he noted that today\
  \ more than ever before, life must be characterized by a sense of universal responsibility,\
  \ not only the nation to the nation, but also human to other forms of life.\nEach\
  \ of us is responsible for a great civilization."
