Text: "If happiness was a place, Tenerife would be it. It was so beautiful at night\
  \ and the gorgeous sea, colorful lights, loud music and happy faces made me feel\
  \ alive and free. The island\u2019s warm air and picturesque views had captured\
  \ my heart. This was my first trip abroad without my family and I decided it wouldn\u2019\
  t be my last. I even considered not returning to England.\n\nEvery night of that\
  \ trip, the girls and I would go out and explore the island. It was like a ritual.\
  \ On our journeys, we did not get bothered by too many men. On occasion, the locals\
  \ would greet us with a cheerful, \u201Cola guapa\u201D and we would, each time,\
  \ laugh it off and politely respond with \u201Cgracias\u201D. However, one particular\
  \ night, as we made our way back to our apartments we noticed a group of men in\
  \ the distance. As their faces became clearer, they began chanting and signaling\
  \ for us to come over. My friends and I were puzzled but we continued to walk. The\
  \ men did not stop chanting. Despite them being on the other side of the road, I\
  \ began to feel very uncomfortable. They clearly wanted something from us. The distance\
  \ between us felt small and the warm air that I thought fed my spirit felt toxic.\
  \ I looked in their direction and saw a small group of black women following behind\
  \ them. I observed the interaction between them, it was very flirtatious. \u201C\
  Maybe they\u2019re on a couple\u2019s holiday and their partners are drunk\u201D\
  , I told myself. We continued walking when my friend stopped us like she just had\
  \ an epiphany, \u201Cguys, those women are prostitutes\u2026and they think we\u2019\
  re prostitutes too.\u201D\n\nI froze. Seconds later, I saw the women behind the\
  \ bins with these men. My heart sank.\n\nThis unfortunate experience is not unique\
  \ to me. Countless black women explorers have had similar issues when travelling\
  \ \u2013 partly because thousands of African women get trafficked for prostitution\
  \ in Europe on a yearly basis, making it easy to mistake any black women to be amongst\
  \ them. What was distressing was the fact that in the eyes of these men were we\
  \ were not sightseers - we could never be. In that moment, unintentionally connected,\
  \ we were all only objects, not lives of value - barely adult English tourists,\
  \ and brave women who, like many African migrants, walked for miles, risked their\
  \ lives by getting on boats with dishonest men, leaving their motherland in pursuit\
  \ of a better life in Europe, alike."
