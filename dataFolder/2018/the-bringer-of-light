Text: "I stuffed my backpack and left.\n\nThere was an excited bustle in the air.\
  \ New Year\u2019s Eve had brought on a flurry of shoppers and diners out on the\
  \ street. A whiff of apple-flavored smoke hung in the air, as Egyptians devoured\
  \ their bowl of vegetarian koshary and settled into their first round of hookah.\
  \ Meanwhile, Google was proving to be unhelpful in directing me to the train station.\n\
  \nI asked a group of women by the sidewalk for directions, but their only reply\
  \ was a disoriented, puzzled look. I started to gesture the train chimney and its\
  \ revolving wheels with my hands, making a steady chuk-chuk sound.\n\n\u201CYou\
  \ want to go train station?\u201D said a high-pitched voice from somewhere behind\
  \ the women.\n\nI caught sight of a tall, abaya-clad woman, smiling slightly as\
  \ she came forward. There was a goofiness in her expression that instantly put me\
  \ at ease. The Lady in Black seemed both surprised and worried to know that I planned\
  \ to travel from Cairo to Alexandria by train, alone, late on the night of New Year\u2019\
  s Eve. She fidgeted restlessly for a few seconds, as if trying to make a difficult\
  \ decision. Then suddenly, she grabbed my hand and started walking towards the taxi\
  \ stand. I followed in a surprised daze. She was a woman, not a man. Surely I could\
  \ trust her.\n\nFor years now, Cairo has been consistently ranked as one of the\
  \ most dangerous cities in the world for women. Often during my daily commutes on\
  \ public transport, a strange man seated next to me would ask if I'm married. I\
  \ had learned the hard way that in Cairo, every woman must be accompanied by a man.\
  \ And yet, here I was, traveling solo.\n\nHead swirling with intermittent anxiety,\
  \ I watched curiously as The Lady In Black got into a taxi with me, and asked to\
  \ go to Ramses Station. Next thing I knew, we were scurrying across the brightly\
  \ lit station and towards the ticket window. Apparently, there was little chance\
  \ of a train going out to Alexandria that holiday night. Persuasion, urgent inquiries.\
  \ I followed the drama, trying to discern as much Arabic as I could.\n\nTwo hours\
  \ later, I was seated in an empty train carriage accompanied by a stout policeman.\
  \ The Lady In Black had explained my predicament to the officials, then turned to\
  \ me and said \u201COne police come with you to Alexandria in train. You are safe.\u201D\
  \ Gratefulness and relief were still pulsing through my veins. In a country steeped\
  \ with patriarchy, two women had braved the dark maze of uncertainty, and achieved\
  \ a purpose.\n\nShe was the Bringer of Light. She was \u2018Nour\u2019."
