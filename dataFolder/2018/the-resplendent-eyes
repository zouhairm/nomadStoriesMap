Text: "Hypnotized in such a warm culture, on an old yellow bus, my trip from Havana\
  \ to Sancti Sp\xEDritus had begun. Through the window, with the landscape, another\
  \ time was being lived. I was looking at the colorful cars and imposing buildings\
  \ that could not forget the past.\n\nFrom my side, suddenly, seated, I discovered\
  \ a form of connection: someone to communicate, to know the memories of what had\
  \ experienced. I was in touch with a local, finally. With my scratched Spanish,\
  \ struggling with my Portuguese, I asked him some questions. It was up to \"How\
  \ do you live here?\" for inspiring and existential doubts, because I love so much\
  \ about the soul of the other that I could not resist.\n\nI perceived in the depths\
  \ of his eyes a magnificent arrangement: the change of scenery, the panorama of\
  \ houses that passed through his iris and pupil, along with the vision of my Brazilian\
  \ origin talking to a Cuban, stuck in the language barriers, but understanding the\
  \ basis of each other\u2019s life, and knowing that we had the same feelings. There\
  \ we were immersed and we had made an exchange of continents to laugh and weep with\
  \ the stories. In parts of silence, he gently started to tell of how much he was\
  \ proud of his daughters, about how much he liked his city, the foods with the famous\
  \ Moorish rice that I was going to discover later to be my gastronomic fondness.\n\
  \nWith six hours of travel, between breaks to the bathroom and stops to the gas\
  \ stations (where I used to take ice cream in a huge pot), I tried to reflect on\
  \ how my Spanish was unexpectedly flowing in every moment and how I managed to abandon\
  \ my shyness in that first conversation in Cuba.\n\nIn the habit of returning to\
  \ the bus, we continued from where we paused. We pointed, we gestured to express\
  \ our emotions. We ran Brazil with my reports from Rio de Janeiro and went to a\
  \ Cuba of so many landmarks only by what was constructed verbally. Until, at a bus\
  \ stop, an acquaintance of my new friend arrives. We then set up a conversation\
  \ for three. And again we laugh and forget that night had come.\n\nWhen I got distracted,\
  \ I saw those two getting up, because they have reached their destination. With\
  \ a mix of ''saudade'', a word of my country that sums up the sensation of missing\
  \ someone, I hugged them. They put in my hands a note of Cuban money and left; the\
  \ thick darkness hid them on the road as I watched. Although, in my heart, those\
  \ beings were pulsing with the many tales they brought me without needing photos\
  \ or books to explain."
