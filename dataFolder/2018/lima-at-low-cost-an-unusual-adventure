Text: "Travel is one of my passions. I\u2019m looking for new places to visit all\
  \ the time. I\u2019m from Ecuador and years ago in my vacations, I decided to travel\
  \ to Per\xFA.  It was my first travel alone so I decided to buy my ticket to Lima\
  \ by bus. I wanted to try something different and I chose to travel by land.  The\
  \ day arrived and the day before the trip I said good bye all my friends and family.\
  \ I was anxious, a little worried but exited to travel.\nOn the bus I was thinking\
  \ about my trip, after a few hours I was on the border of Ecuador and Peru, I never\
  \ thought how I could feel in that moment but when I checked my Passport in Peru\
  \ I realized that I couldn\u2019t  go back. When I crossed the border I felt worried,\
  \ I had to travel 26 hours to Lima, in the moment that the bus arrived I had other\
  \ problem, I forgot to book my hotel. I felt scared until I remember the name of\
  \ a hotel from a review online, so I took a taxi and I went there.\nMy ideas about\
  \ my first travel in that moment were confuse, I was looking for money in my backpack\
  \ and I noticed a big problem\u2026 I lost my money!  I couldn\u2019t find it! I\
  \ took out all my clothes and my money dissapeared so I decided to enjoy with a\
  \ shoestring budget my adventure in Lima.\nMy hotel was in Miraflores, a beautiful\
  \ place in Lima. Early in the morning I left the hotel  to search my breakfast so\
  \ I found a place where they sold empanadas lime\xF1as. It was the first time that\
  \ I saw a lot of flavors of  empanadas. After that, I decided to take a taxi and\
  \ I asked to the taxi driver what tourist attraction can I met first?  The taxi\
  \ driver was very kind and he told me all the advices to meet Lima\u2019s emblematic\
  \ places.\n To walk around the historic center, admire its great balconies or go\
  \ to chinatown in Lima, are cheap things that you can do. Chinatown is a great place\
  \ where you can feel that you are in Asia. All around you is written in chinese!\
  \  If you want to buy cheap things you have to go to Gamarra, a place where you\
  \ can buy anything you want at low cost.\nAfter three days I had to return to Guayaquil,\
  \ I have a long ride in front of me, but the travel to Lima alone was a decision\
  \ that pushed myself to travel more, I grew up such as person and I understood that\
  \ our fears do not let us advance, I learned that traveling alone is feeding our\
  \ soul to be happy; that you can travel and enjoy with a little money the difference\
  \ is made by each one of us."
