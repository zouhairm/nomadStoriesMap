Text: "It was midnight and the storm was now blowing furiously.  Rain was hammering\
  \ into our faces and my forehead and cheekbones stung with a crawling icy numbness.\
  \  The rain regularly changed to sheets of sleet or hail forcing us to close our\
  \ eyes or drop our heads for a few seconds relief.  I could feel the hood of my\
  \ jacket whipping against the back of my neck and I cursed how I had neglected to\
  \ fold it away at the last stop.  It was becoming difficult to put one foot in front\
  \ of the other.  \n\nWe were climbing Croagh Patrick, Ireland\u2019s famous mountain,\
  \ which stands like a silent sentinel over Clew Bay in Co. Mayo.  As we reached\
  \ the middle section of the climb I knew we would encounter even worse conditions.\
  \  The winds which greeted us as we crested the ridge had reached an extraordinary\
  \ speed and breathing became shallow as air was forced down into the lungs and resisted\
  \ on the way out.  \n\nI glanced over at my companions Griffiths and Lenihan and\
  \ through a narrow but powerful head lamp beam I could see them on all fours and\
  \ leaning headfirst into the raging maelstrom.  I followed suit, taking handfuls\
  \ of the sandy gravel that lines the holy mountain.  The sinister winter night had\
  \ closed in tightly and Lenihans face bore a look I had seen many times before.\
  \  That of grim youth arrogantly demanding results off body and limb while Mother\
  \ Nature delivered yet another harsh life lesson.\n\nThe small church at the summit\
  \ took us by surprise.  It suddenly appeared and reflected the dull light of a head\
  \ torch.  Each man cracked a weary smile as the gable end appeared and again as\
  \ we touched the small red door on the east side.  Its harsh red paint had cracked\
  \ and become brittle and flaked away into the gale under our touch.  I slid against\
  \ the rough plasterwork and sat with my back to the locked door.  A momentary clearance\
  \ in the night cloud showed the warm lights of Westport far below.  Five seconds\
  \ beautiful reward after two hours exhaustive effort.   \n     \nWe each took turns\
  \ to drink from the water bottle and forced bars and bananas down our throats. \
  \ Food had never before tasted so bland or delivered so little comfort.  I even\
  \ resented the energy wasted to chew it.  We each stood motionless for a minuet,\
  \ started to get cold then looked at one another and turned.  No words were exchanged.\
  \  As we cleared the shelter of the small whitewashed building the furious tail\
  \ winds caught us across the back and shoulders and surged us foreword into the\
  \ inky night."
