Text: "The boat men poled us along in their mekoro, through water that was often shallow\
  \ and required strategic pushing and turning. The sun had grown low enough now that\
  \ we weren\u2019t pouring sweat when the grasses grew tall on either side, obstructing\
  \ the wind. They maneuvered the boats to make it through the narrow channels into\
  \ the larger pools, much the way life had propelled me here, from the confinement\
  \ of city life to the vast expanse of southern Africa. 10 years of 40-hour work\
  \ weeks to add to my 401k and pay my mortgage had earned me a month-long sabbatical.\
  \ I joined an overland camping tour through four countries with 13 strangers who,\
  \ much to my surprise, had become like family within the first few days together.\n\
  Two weeks into our tour we reached the Okavango Delta, where I shared a mokoro poled\
  \ by a man called Tarzan with a woman near my age who grew up one town away from\
  \ me in Connecticut. Meeting her halfway around the world was a twist of fate that\
  \ made me love traveling. Our seven mekoro drew close together, forming a raft about\
  \ 100 yards from a bloat of hippos. A few of the animals swam closer to investigate\
  \ us, baring their teeth and splashing around to show their dominance. None of us\
  \ needed convincing; we had seen videos of hippos killing crocodiles, lions, anything\
  \ that threatened them. I should have been intimidated by them, but I felt captivated\
  \ and vibrantly alive. Through my zoom lens, they looked goofy, with their whiskers\
  \ and bug eyes - more like Muppets than real animals. We sat in the calm waters\
  \ watching them quietly, only moving to pass a bottle opener between boats for a\
  \ sundowner beer or cider. In the peace of the moment, my lingering anxieties evaporated.\n\
  As the light began to fade, our crew turned the mekoro around and headed back toward\
  \ the island where we\u2019d set up camp. In our boat, Reena and I began discussing\
  \ life goals, our mutual desire to have children though we were both in the latter\
  \ half of our 30\u2019s and single. She wanted to go back to a corporate job when\
  \ this was over, liked the orderly nature of it, while I wanted a major change,\
  \ a completely different kind of life. I was beginning to understand that I needed\
  \ excursions like this to be my normal. The sun reached a cloud bank as it neared\
  \ the horizon, bright arms extending up in a final surrender. Back on the island\
  \ that night, I lay in my tent listening for roaming hippos in search of greener\
  \ grass, and wondering what exhilarating adventure the next day would bring."
