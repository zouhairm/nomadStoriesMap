Text: "\"So, what do you think?\" she asked, as she pried open the rusty rear doors\
  \ of the camper van. The white-haired woman smiled with wrinkles so deep they made\
  \ the Grand Canyon seem shallow.\n\nMy hand clung to the stack of crisp $100 bills\
  \ in my pocket.\n\nThe stench of mold from the soggy floorboards beneath the toilet\
  \ made me wonder if this van had ever been cared for, or if it was simply left to\
  \ rot on the rainy side of Big Island, HI. \n\nI knew that I was staring bumper-to-bumper\
  \ at a bad investment.\n\nOn July 4th, 2011, Danielle and I danced down the aisle,\
  \ newly married, wearing Indiana Jones fedoras and celebrating Independence from\
  \ our families. I admired Indy and his adventures, where people were as priceless\
  \ as the artifacts and the world's treasures were one red line away on a weathered\
  \ map.\n\nThree months later, from the hippie town of Bellingham, WA, we set out.\
  \ We packed what little we had: a few hundred bucks, love in our hearts and wanderlust\
  \ in our souls. \n\nOn the surface we were excited, but deep down, currents of fear\
  \ were eroding our optimism. It always worked out for Indy, but he took some nasty\
  \ beatings along the way.\n\nWe tried to settle in the hippie city of Santa Cruz,\
  \ CA. But three years later, our gypsy spirits had already traveled on, beckoning\
  \ our logic to follow. We listened, stuffing the doubt, along with our belongings,\
  \ back into boxes and moved to Maui.\n\nAs we unpacked a second time, we threw away\
  \ a little more uncertainty. Hawaii felt like home. Yet our travel-loving souls\
  \ started dreaming up new possibilities. Our goals were outgrowing the islands.\n\
  \n\"How about a cross-country road trip?\" our hearts whispered. \"We can't do that.\"\
  \ Logic fearfully replied.\n\nYet, as we began packing once more, for a nomadic\
  \ life on wheels, we tossed a bit more fear in the rubbish bin and set the compass\
  \ toward the mainland.\n\nI opened my hand to give the wrinkly woman the cash and\
  \ in that one act, let go of everything holding me back. That defining moment of\
  \ release paved the way to experience sunrises over Mt. Rainier, getting lost in\
  \ the winding trails of Yosemite, embracing the prickly exterior of a Joshua Tree\
  \ and witnessing the true depth of the Grand Canyon firsthand.\n\nAlthough that\
  \ camper van truly was a bad investment, it was also the starting point of our own\
  \ red lines across a weathered map.\n\nIndy would be proud."
