Text: "6 flights in 9 days. So begins the tale of my journey home, to Miri, Sarawak.\
  \ Perhaps it was my own fault for wanting to build a new life far away from my frail\
  \ hometown. Miri was once the pride and joy of the Malaysian Oil & Gas industry.\
  \ In the 1900s, when Big Oil was booming, the rich and industrious Royal Dutch Shell\
  \ decided to set up their operations on Miri\u2019s shores. It boosted the economy,\
  \ provided jobs, and brought over droves of \u2018Mat Sallehs\u2019 (colloquial\
  \ term for \u2018Westerners\u2019). Miri had transformed. But, it was still a city\
  \ perfect just for a family settling down; not a teenager with growing pains and\
  \ big dreams. I wanted to escape. \n\nFast forward 12 years later, I am 7000 miles\
  \ on the other side of the world. I have just graduated and have started my first\
  \ official job as a chemical engineer working amongst the \u2018Mat Sallehs\u2019\
  . It has been 7 years since I have returned to Miri. Faces and voices of my relatives\
  \ have become a blur. Miri had faced a reversal of fortune as the oil prices depleted.\
  \ Grand houses that were once the envy of the town now stood empty with \u2018to\
  \ rent\u2019 signs plastered all over the gates. I was not sure when I would next\
  \ return to Miri. My parents, however, had other plans and made a formal request\
  \ of me returning home. They did this in their typical fashion of guilt-tripping.\
  \ I, as a filial daughter, obliged.\n\nThe occasion that was sold to me was my grandparents\u2019\
  \ joint 80th birthday party. We did not truly know if they were 80 as all documentation\
  \ of their age had been lost but it was a fake age that was well received. It was\
  \ also a week before Chinese New Year and what better time to visit the relatives\
  \ and wish them prosperity and good fortune.  \n\nAt the party, I took photos of\
  \ my conservative grandparents shyly smiling over their lighted cake as the entire\
  \ restaurant sang happy birthday.  It was adorable, and I wanted to tease them but\
  \ I held my tongue. I did not know my grandparents well. The language barrier had\
  \ always been a factor and a saboteur of smooth conversations. As I took the final\
  \ photo, my grandfather gave me a cheeky smile and wink. And for once, I felt my\
  \ grandfather knew me or at least wanted to. \n\nI had discounted Miri as I believed\
  \ I had seen everything it had to offer. But it seems like I do not have to venture\
  \ far to find more life in Miri. The Mandarin classes I am currently undertaking\
  \ will surely come in handy the next time I visit.  I would do those 6 flights in\
  \ 9 days again."
