Text: "The cinema of Argentina is one of the nation's most beloved exports and has\
  \ in turn inspired a sense of wonder and mystery for outsiders who are fascinated\
  \ by the possibilities and potentials such a land has to offer. The subjects of\
  \ Argentine films are diverse and address a broad range of social and cultural issued\
  \ faced within the country, while also showcasing the rhythms of tango culture,\
  \ the inspirational architecture of Buenos Aires, San Miguel de Tucum\xE1n, and\
  \ C\xF3rdoba, as well as the nation's awe-inspiring landscapes. Argentina has be\
  \ a frequent contributor for major film awards and most notably \"La historia oficial\
  \ (1985) and El secreto de sus ojos (2009), have won the Academy Award for Best\
  \ Foreign Language film. Argentina's role as one of the major film industries of\
  \ the Spanish-speaking world has produced a wide variety of images and perceptions\
  \ of the country. \n\nMy project would involve traveling to the location and settings\
  \ of major Argentine films that address the culture, history, landscape, and identity\
  \ of the country. This act of \"cinematic tourism\" will attempt to look at the\
  \ contrasts between the actual and perceived Argentina and investigate how fictional\
  \ reconstructions through film inspire the real and the imagined. After traveling\
  \ through and witnessing firsthand Argentina's cities, landscapes, and cultures,\
  \ I will then reconstruct my experience and showcase how these films paralleled\
  \ or deviated from my personal experience. For example while in Buenos Aires I can\
  \ retrace the first step of Che Guevara's journey as shown in The Motorcycle Diaries\
  \ (2004) and accentuate the contrast between urban rural landscapes within the country\
  \ both historically and in the present day. This approach can be repeated through\
  \ looking at how numerous Argentine films intersect within these questions of contrasting\
  \ visions and identities the country has to offer."
