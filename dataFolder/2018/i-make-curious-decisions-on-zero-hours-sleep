Text: "It\u2019s 2am and the queue is hellishly long. Under the unforgiving light\
  \ families push their overfilled suitcases in the direction of the check-in desk.\
  \ A plump man and his toddlers noisily crunch their way through a packet of banana\
  \ chips.\nWe wait in the neon-lit departure lounge for two hours. I watch the second\
  \ hand of a large clock mounted above an advertisement portraying a dolled up woman\
  \ on top of a large skyscraper. I haven\u2019t the faintest idea what it\u2019s\
  \ trying to sell.\n\u201CCan passengers for flight TG484 please prepare for boarding\u201D\
  \ comes the nasal voice through the tanoy. It\u2019s quarter to four in the morning.\
  \ \nOn the flight I sit next to an Indian man who talks to me about philosophy.\
  \ I\u2019m falling asleep to his dulcet tones when he abruptly changes the subject:\
  \ \u201Cyou\u2019re not looking to buy a car, are you?\u201D\nAnd then we\u2019\
  re back in Australia, shrugging off the last scents of Asia and breathing in the\
  \ familiar air. I find myself following the Indian man (I still didn\u2019t know\
  \ his name) to his house. It\u2019s even more surreal on zero hours sleep. \nI suspect\
  \ the car has travelled far further than its alleged 218,000 kilometres. The bumper\
  \ is dented and bonnet rusted; the paint\u2019s peeling and there\u2019s some metal\
  \ sticking up at right angles on the windscreen. I will later discover that the\
  \ aircon doesn\u2019t work and the handbrake is faulty. I fall in love immediately.\n\
  \u201CShe\u2019s pretty reliable\u201D he assures. \u201CLooks it\u201D I say.\n\
  I give the car a spin on the melting tarmac of Cairns. I\u2019m terrified and forget\
  \ how the clutch works. They are silent in the back. I can feel my sweat being absorbed\
  \ by the porous seats. \n\u201CWill you do $800?\u201D I\u2019m too tired to even\
  \ consider looking at another car. \n\u201CDone\u201D he replies, emphatically.\
  \ It\u2019s the last thing I expected, but who can beat a touch of spontaneous madness?\n\
  I hand over eight crisp $100 notes. I don\u2019t need to call a mechanic to confirm\
  \ my insanity.\nIn exchange he gives me a tiny piece of paper on which we scrawl\
  \ our signatures. He then rips it in half. Apparently, this serves as both proof\
  \ of registration and insurance. I hope I\u2019ll never need to find out how. \n\
  We\u2019ve only been in Australia for three hours and I\u2019ve now got a battered\
  \ Daewoo Nubira and a heavily jetlagged companion. We\u2019re in Cairns, north-east\
  \ Australia. I\u2019ve got to get to Perth, west Australia. Term starts in thirty\
  \ days so we\u2019d better get a move on. \nMy eyes are bleeding and my brain delirious,\
  \ so I down some filthy instant coffee. \n\u201CReady to hit the road?\u201D April\
  \ says."
