Text: "Christmas took me by surprise this year. Not surrounded by tacky decorations\
  \ and annoying songs I\u2019ve barely noticed when December came around. Thinking\
  \ on my feet I\u2019ve decided to spend a few days in a small village of Hopkins\
  \ on Belizean coast. That\u2019s how I\u2019ve found myself sitting under a coconut\
  \ palm, drawing a snowman in the sand (what? It\u2019s white!), and trying to figure\
  \ out what\u2019s missing. I\u2019m not a big fan of holidays, but somehow sitting\
  \ there alone, with this beautiful tropical landscape all to myself, I felt weirdly\
  \ lost and melancholic. \n\nAlthough few people have cars in Belize, the public\
  \ transport system leaves something to be desired. Or, I should say, private transport,\
  \ since each local bus has a different owner, often the driver himself. Mine \u2013\
  \ painted in vibrant rasta colours old American school bus \u2013 has left me by\
  \ the main road, 10 miles from Hopkins. Undeterred I\u2019ve gamely settled in for\
  \ a nice little walk under the scorching tropical sun. Soon a pick-up truck full\
  \ of men stopped next to me. Although generally cautious, I\u2019ve been in Belize\
  \ for long enough now not to be afraid of taking a ride from strangers. Sitting\
  \ in the back of the car with the men and their drums, I\u2019ve learned that they\
  \ were from a Garifuna drum band and by the end of the short trip I\u2019ve gotten\
  \ myself invited to a concert in a local restaurant.\n\nI\u2019ve been fascinated\
  \ by the Garifuna people, who came to Belize when re-setteld from the Caribbean\
  \ islands by the British. Here they\u2019ve found the place to live their customs,\
  \ speak the language and celebrate the culture \u2013 all of which they couldn\u2019\
  t do back home. I loved their drumming, their dance, and their attitudes. Needless\
  \ to say, when the sun set I made my way to the concert.\n\nTravelling solo has\
  \ many advantages but eating out can be awkward. Fortunately the restaurant, which\
  \ was basically a shack on the beach, was charming, with long tables and excellent\
  \ food. I\u2019ve ordered a Panty Ripper \u2013 after 3 months in Belize the feminist\
  \ inside me still cringed at the name of a simple yet surprisingly delicious cocktail\
  \ made from coconut rum and pineapple juice \u2013 and settled in to wait. My friends\
  \ from the truck soon came in and started to drum. By then I\u2019ve met a few other\
  \ people, mostly local, but also a few lost tourists like myself. When the concert\
  \ started I was already feeling great, celebrating the holidays by having genuine\
  \ fun with a bunch of newly-met people."
