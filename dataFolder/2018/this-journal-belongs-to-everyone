Text: "On the night of March 23, 2016, I thought to myself, life can not get better\
  \ than this. As my legs were dangling freely off rooftop edge of Hotel Roessli in\
  \ Alpnachstad, Switzerland, I admired the stars that blanketed their way across\
  \ the sky. I could hear the faint noise of champagne glasses clinking together as\
  \ my friends cheered from Room 26. I was sixteen when I got to experience my first\
  \ adventure, but at the age of eighteen I experienced the greatest adventure that\
  \ I have so far encountered. \nDuring my senior year of high school I lost both\
  \ my grandfather\u2019s, a boyfriend, and a perceived sense of self. A friend of\
  \ mine suggested journaling to uncover what might be missing; which I believed to\
  \ be total nonsense. I had never written for my own enjoyment, but I decided to\
  \ try it out anyways. I then purchased a leather bound diary and turned to the first\
  \ page to read, \u201CThis journal belongs to ____.\u201D I wrote in this journal\
  \ so much that it became something my teachers would proceed to email my parents\
  \ about claiming that it was a distraction. Eventually, my thoughts became repetitive,\
  \ so I asked the girl next to me in class to write something in my journal. Moments\
  \ later, she handed it back to me and, in smeared ink, it read, \u201CToday I came\
  \ to school without a sock on.\u201D As simple as this entry was to her, I found\
  \ myself ecstatic every time I came across this piece and that was when my mind\
  \ suddenly sparked of a new idea. While I continued to write, I started to ask other\
  \ people to write in it as well. This journal soon became filled with stories of\
  \ strangers I met, whether they be sitting next to me on a plane flight or something\
  \ as simple as someone I met in a local cafe. The letters my best friend sent me\
  \ while he was stationed in Japan stuck out from the bottom of the pages, and the\
  \ photos I took of an elderly couple who told me their love tale added a splash\
  \ of color to this chronicle. \nAs my journal became filled to the last page, I\
  \ decided to go through and read all of the entries since day one. When I opened\
  \ to the first page, though, I noticed something different. My name had an \u201C\
  X\u201D through it and someone had written, \u201CThis journal belongs to Everyone.\u201D\
  \ As I traveled my way through the hearts and minds of others ink written works,\
  \ I realized that adventure does not always have to be across the world in order\
  \ to be experienced. In this case, it was in my own hands all along."
