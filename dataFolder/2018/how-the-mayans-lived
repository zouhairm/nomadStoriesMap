Text: "Food is a genuine representation of any culture. The best way to understand\
  \ the history of a culture is by learning how the people used to live and eat. We\
  \ learned about the ancient Mayans by spending time with the Cal family in Toledo\
  \ district in Belize. We were welcomed by Anita, the matriarch of the family trying\
  \ to preserve the Mayan lifestyle along with her husband Joe and four children.\n\
  As we were walking towards their house, we noticed it was surrounded by a lush garden\
  \ with plants ranging from small shrubs to huge trees. Later we learned that all\
  \ their daily necessities are obtained from this garden from walls & roof, clothes,\
  \ utensils, musical instruments, food and even soap.\nThe Cals live in a small room\
  \ with walls made from the trunks of palm trees and the roof made by weaving palm\
  \ leaves together. The floor is kept uneven so that the higher sections can be used\
  \ as \u201Cpillows\u201D while sleeping at night. Anita and her daughters sweep\
  \ the floor using a broom which is made with palm leaves from a tree in the garden\
  \ and the loose sand is used to reinforce the floor.\nThe best experience of our\
  \ stay was making corn tortillas. The process is long and arduous but at the end\
  \ of it, you are rewarded with fresh, delicious tortillas. They still use the ancient\
  \ Mayan method of grinding corn by hand using stone tools. We tried grinding the\
  \ soaked corn but lost steam within minutes. We were a bit embarrassed to see Anita\u2019\
  s daughters go through at least five pounds of corn effortlessly. Later we all sat\
  \ around a huge pile of ground corn paste and started making tortillas and baking\
  \ them on a wood fire. It was just a surreal experience.\nWhile rest of the lunch\
  \ was being prepared, Joe gave us a tour of the garden. They grow everything from\
  \ all-spice, chocolate, palm and gourds which are used as utensils. A fascinating\
  \ tree in the garden was soapberry. The berry can be rubbed on hands with some water\
  \ and it foams up like modern soap and is used to clean and soften hands.\nAfter\
  \ the garden tour, we washed hands using the soapberry and sat down for lunch. The\
  \ food was really basic but delicious as the ancient Mayans ate \u2013 palm hearts,\
  \ purple potatoes & chicken stew, corn tortillas and a chocolate drink made by grinding\
  \ cacao beans by hand.\nTime spent there gave us a glimpse of the ancient Mayan\
  \ lifestyle. The Cals are doing an excellent job and I hope more people take notice\
  \ of their work and lend a hand in preserving the wonderful and astonishing culture."
