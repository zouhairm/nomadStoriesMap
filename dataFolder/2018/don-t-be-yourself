Text: "Checking into one of the most extravagant hotels in the city, I looked around.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t how I imagined it would be \u2013 it was better. I was in Thailand.\n\
  Having landed just two hours ago, I had made a mental note to visit the spa at the\
  \ corner, check out why the McDonalds here sell beef (P.S. I\u2019m from India)\
  \ and how I could sneak out without my parent\u2019s knowledge to hit the hottest\
  \ nightclub in town. Little did I know that something as simple as an evening walk\
  \ would change my prospect of life itself!\n\nA couple of hours later, napped and\
  \ relaxed, I made up my mind to discover the mighty land for myself. I made an appointment,\
  \ checked myself in and started enjoying the massage. I was pleasantly surprised\
  \ to find the masseur nattering in English and started to have a conversation with\
  \ her. She was cheerful, attended to a few customers while requesting me to wait\
  \ and served me a Thai snack too. She soon resumed the massage and we continued\
  \ speaking. She was a native, single-mother to four boys and ran the spa along with\
  \ her sister. Within a few minutes, it became evident that life in the city wasn\u2019\
  t all pomp and gaiety. She struggled every day, wasn\u2019t educated so couldn\u2019\
  t work in an office and barely saved anything. I also asked her how so many women\
  \ were working in food stalls and local places, and why they out-numbered men. She\
  \ then told me that majority of the city comprised of single women \u2013 yes, women\
  \ ran businesses, sold food, checked people in hotels and owned stores.\n\nThe shocking\
  \ truth came next \u2013 most of them survived in the city because it didn\u2019\
  t mock or question their identity post their sex-change surgery. Thailand was cheap,\
  \ one didn\u2019t know too many people here and it could be conveniently done too.\
  \ While returning back to their home-town was an option ruled out by many, they\
  \ preferred living in the city, earning their bread and living a life on their own.\
  \ Most of these people previously held high-end jobs; had good families and some\
  \ were even millionaires. So why the need to settle in a place that purely survives\
  \ on tourism; has a shaky economy and makes life rather difficult? Simply because\
  \ it accepted people as they were.\n\nThis short and random interaction changed\
  \ my outlook on life completely \u2013 it isn\u2019t wealth, glamour or your position\
  \ that matters, in the end, it\u2019s all about being someplace you are accepted,\
  \ just the way you are. Everything else simply pales in comparison.\n\nLive and\
  \ let live."
