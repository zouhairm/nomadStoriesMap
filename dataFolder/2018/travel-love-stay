Text: "Australia was not really on my bucket list, however, my sister insisted that\
  \ we must go. We said goodbye to our family and friends and in August 2008, we arrived\
  \ in Sydney. I managed to cover three states in three months before I completely\
  \ ran out of money. Yet, the last thing I expected is that this major financial\
  \ crisis would be the path leading me to fulfilling my deepest travelling desires.\
  \ Similar to Elizabeth Gilbert, I fell for a charming Brazilian man with whom I\
  \ flew to Bela Vista located in the state of Goya, Brazil. I had never heard of\
  \ this place before and I am pretty much convinced I was the only international\
  \ tourist to have ever stepped foot in this backwater country town.\nAfter landing\
  \ in Goiania, we made our way southwards, enthralled by the vivid colours of the\
  \ landscape. The fertile earth was extremely red, the grass and plantations deep\
  \ green, the sky a rich blue, the white cotton clouds floated above like giant meringues\
  \ and grazing cattle decorated this \u201Cmirage\u201D in a range of varied tones.\n\
  Bela Vista is part of the Goiaina region and its population is about 21,000. Many\
  \ of its residents live in rural areas and work in agriculture, so there is a real\
  \ country feel to the place. The people I met here are warm and friendly and would\
  \ go beyond their way to make you feel welcome. The town centre has a few local\
  \ shops and restaurants, a popular church and the busiest bank I have ever seen.\
  \ Cars drive around playing loud Arrocha music and random firecrackers scare the\
  \ hell out of the street dogs. Luckily enough, we managed to avoid much of this\
  \ chaos by staying in a charming farm house. Surrounded by fish ponds, cows, horses\
  \ and organic crops, we relaxed in hammocks and observed Araras flying by.\nHere,\
  \ I tried Pequi (aromatic native fruit), Capybara (rodent meat) and a traditional\
  \ Fajoada (Brasilian stew) for the first time, it is not for weak stomachs or sensitive\
  \ eyes however, each taste is incredible. I also participated in a Pamonhas extravaganza\
  \ whereby a bunch of men and women gather to grate hundreds of sweet corn cobs,\
  \ turning them into pulp and then boiling them in corn husks. In this patriarchal\
  \ society women still cook, clean and serve while men keep piling up their empty\
  \ beer cans. Nonetheless, at the end of the day with the abundance of good food,\
  \ alcohol, music, and positive vibes, no one takes any notice of inequalities. A\
  \ reality far detached from my everyday life across the globe in the place that\
  \ I now call home- Australia."
