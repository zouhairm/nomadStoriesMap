Text: "We wanted to see the \u2018real\u2019 China, to get under its skin and experience\
  \ something Shanghai with its Gucci boutiques and Expo World Fair couldn\u2019t\
  \ give us. \n\nWe opted for the canal town of Xitang, just a short hop, skip and\
  \ a 3-hour train ride from the city. Chinese New Year commuters meant that the train\
  \ was the next level above \u2018packed\u2019, and we became pretty intimately acquainted\
  \ with our fellow passengers \u2013 even sharing lunches. 3 very sweaty hours later\
  \ we arrived at a station which, according to the guidebook was \u201Ca short bus\
  \ ride to Xitang\u201D, great we thought until we saw about 200 busses outside and\
  \ no idea which one was needed.\n\nXitang? I asked the first bus driver, who shook\
  \ his head. I repeated this process about 15 times until finally someone nodded.\
  \ The bus quickly filled up with locals before pulling away. After a short while\
  \ the landscape became more desolate and as time passed and a \u2018short bus ride\u2019\
  \ became a longer one I found myself wondering whether maybe I\u2019d not pronounced\
  \ Xitang quite right.\n\nChecking the guidebook again I found Xitang written in\
  \ Mandarin (something in hindsight it would have been handy to know earlier) and\
  \ I showed it to one of our fellow passengers. Her laughter was not immediately\
  \ encouraging, and nor was it when she shouted down the bus and everyone else started\
  \ laughing too. \n\nAfter about 40 minutes we reached the end of the line; a dustbowl\
  \ town with few discernible signs of life, apart from our, still-chuckling, fellow\
  \ passengers heading off in various directions. A group gathered though to try and\
  \ explain to the driver what had happened and to ask him to help \u2013 which, after\
  \ his allotted cigarette stop, he agreed to do. We set off again and we were soon\
  \ headed back in the direction of the station. Suddenly he began shouting and gesturing\
  \ to us, pointing at another bus further ahead up the street \u2013 it was the one\
  \ we needed and our driver was giving chase. As he drove, he pulled out a pad of\
  \ paper and a pencil, scribbling a note in Mandarin to explain to the next bus.\
  \ After a couple of minutes of adept but speedy manoeuvring he was able to make\
  \ it pull over and we got out thanking him in, I\u2019m sure incomprehensible, Mandarin.\n\
  \nWe did make it to Xitang soon after that, which was completely lovely, but had\
  \ been overshadowed somwhat by the wonderful people we\u2019d met on the way there.\
  \ We had to set out to encounter some part of real China, and the journey had been\
  \ packed to gunnels with authentic, beautiful human kindness."
