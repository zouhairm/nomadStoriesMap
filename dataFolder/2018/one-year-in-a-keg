Text: "Balkan powder keg is not just a saying, it is a reality and for those who do\
  \ not believe I recommend a trip to this corner of Europe. If you manage to understand\
  \ fully how Bosnia and Herzegovina is ruled simultaneously by three different presidents\
  \ and who is who I will give you a standing ovation. \nCrossing Balkan borders you\
  \ may have got the impression that even though you just stood two hours on the border,\
  \ your car was turned inside out by something that looked like anti-terrorist squad\
  \ lead by drug detecting German shepherds, in fact you did not leave the country.\
  \ Despite official territorial settlement people stay where they think they belong,\
  \ which in the case of this peninsula equals to common chaos. Going out of Macedonia\
  \ in the direction of Kosovo you may pass by Albanian flags,where you will be welcomed\
  \ by the black eagle flapping in the wind on a red background and you have not even\
  \ been in Albania so far.\n\nA reality seems more like fiction or a journey to the\
  \ past. Dealing with the absurdity of local bureaucracy in the gloomy corridors\
  \ of the police station, standing in a crowd that doesn\u2019t seem to know the\
  \ notion of a queue, inhaling the smoke of cigarettes everywhere, I had a flashback\
  \ from the movies, a sudden realization - so that\u2019s how socialism felt like.\
  \ I would never expect that given the economic situation of the country people can\
  \ be so relaxed grasping carpe diem and dolce far niente despite the crisis, still\
  \ calmly drinking a coffee for two hours enjoying the sun and not hurrying anywhere.\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t expect horse carriage and scooters passing by crossroads and pavements\
  \ breaking every possible rule. I would have never thought that being surrounded\
  \ by chaos makes you so calm inside and slows down the time, because once there\
  \ is not much to do the only thing left is to enjoy. I also didn\u2019t expect the\
  \ hospitability and kindness of others, shared rakija, cordial hugs, evening feasts\
  \ in group of friends while the band plays in the background. I never thought I\
  \ would experience so many contradictions. Everyone being late yet being on time,\
  \ night prohibition without a person short on alcohol, gigantic cross overlooking\
  \ the city with muezzin call in the background, Islamic school for girls facing\
  \ nightclub, a small universe of ticking bombs settled in harmony.\n\nSo if anyone\
  \ asked me two years ago to imagine all that, the last thing I expected was to live\
  \ there. But I did, one year and it was great."
