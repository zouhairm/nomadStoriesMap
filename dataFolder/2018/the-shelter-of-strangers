Text: "At the farmer\u2019s market in LA, a jumble of street-food stands out near\
  \ the old tar pits, I split off from my companions to find a meal and instead found\
  \ myself in conversation with a young girl from a tiny Sino-Korean border town who\
  \ had moved with her family to Texas - then LA alone as she couldn\u2019t stand\
  \ the quiet of anywhere else - and an older woman who had travelled back from Munich\
  \ where her partner lived, only the day before. \n \u2018What you eating there?\
  \ Looks delicious.\u2019\n \u2018Vegetable curry - Japanese, I think,\u2019 I stammered,\
  \ taken aback by the question from the blue. It was delicious though; the girl had\
  \ a keen eye. \n \u2018Mind if I join you?\u2019 \n I nodded without her seeing\
  \ as she was busy sitting down opposite me anyway. At this point the lady that had\
  \ been sitting quietly a seat away from me chimed in with a greeting. \n \u2018\
  Where are y\u2019all from?\u2019\n \u2018I\u2019m from England, south of London,\
  \ but not the South of London,\u2019 I replied, knowing that anyone could be one\
  \ of the many Londoners that became offended when I failed to make that distinction.\
  \ \n \u2018And I\u2019m from here, but I spend most of my time in Munich,\u2019\
  \ the older woman explained. \n \u2018That\u2019s cool,\u2019 I replied, asking\
  \ for recommendations for the place as I intended to visit the Christmas markets\
  \ there later that year. \n She obliged with tales of smoked fish and spiced wines,\
  \ illustrious and magisterial. We chattered on in a vain fashion, eating and losing\
  \ track of time until my brother came to retrieve me, abruptly cutting the new connection\
  \ short.\n \u2018Well I hope you enjoy Cali, and have fun in Munich this year.\u2019\
  \n She finished her food then got up and left. I never made it to Munich in the\
  \ end. \n \u2018I best be going too,\u2019 said my younger acquaintance, \u2018\
  I need to see a travel agent about going back home.\u2019\n I didn\u2019t think\
  \ to ask which home she meant. \n \u2018I thought you couldn\u2019t stand the quiet\
  \ there?\u2019\n \u2018Yeah, but I can never really stay in one place for too long,\
  \ y\u2019know?\u2019\n I knew the feeling well.\n\n*\n Hollywood towers in tall\
  \ white letters like an omen, a savage expectation to uphold its name, and whilst\
  \ I thought for a moment I\u2019d fear that pressure, I could see it worked on those\
  \ who lived here, from the strip down to the sea. \n Sweeping, impassable, the final\
  \ monarch of all oceans, the Pacific is awe itself. The furthest West, the furthest\
  \ East; it bookends the very earth, for a hundred million years its alpha and omega,\
  \ as it will stay for a hundred million more. \n In life it is not death we must\
  \ accept but impermanence."
