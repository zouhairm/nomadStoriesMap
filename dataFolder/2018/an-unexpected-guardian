Text: "At the base of the Chato volcano, my hiking partner and I met a stray dog.\
  \ He appeared quietly at my side. He was small and unremarkable, but I took an immediate\
  \ liking to him. I affectionately named him Chico.  \n\nChico stayed by my side\
  \ as we began our ascent. We soon passed other hikers on our way up the mud-covered\
  \ path. \n\n\"You're just heading up?\" they asked. \"You better hurry, you won't\
  \ be able to see anything once the sun sets unless you've got a flashlight with\
  \ you.\" \n\nWe didn't. But we had a stray dog.  \n\nWe were in search of the crater\
  \ lake at the top of Chato volcano, with its mineral-rich, emerald green waters.\
  \ We were quiet as we hiked through the thick cloud forest, both struggling to catch\
  \ our breath as we ascended the steep trail, dodging the bulging roots of the surrounding\
  \ trees. Chico was much more agile than we were; he had to stop often to wait for\
  \ us to catch up to him. \n\nI was thankful when a sign let us know we had reached\
  \ the top, but the crater lake was nowhere in sight. We aggressively continued our\
  \ search with a newfound energy, thankful to be on flat ground. The three of us\
  \ forged through the dense forest. \n\nChico's low growl broke my focus. I looked\
  \ down and discovered the cause of the threatening sound coming from the tiny body\
  \ at my feet. The cause was not of the garter snake variety that occasionally appeared\
  \ in my backyard during the summer. Its upper body was arched forward menacingly.\
  \ Another step and my exposed ankle would have been directly in its path had it\
  \ not been for Chico's warning.  \n\nI turned quickly to retrace my steps, relieved\
  \ that my canine protector followed. I was just about ready to abandon our search\
  \ for the crater lake when we stumbled upon its entrance. The burning sun was quickly\
  \ sinking in the sky, but I was determined to stand at the lake's shores. The descent\
  \ was steep, and as I was struggling to stay upright, I slipped and found myself\
  \ barreling toward the crater lake, as Chico deafeningly alerted all within earshot\
  \ of the danger unfolding in front of him.  \n\nAs I scanned my body for injuries,\
  \ I decided we had gone far enough. We would not reach the crater lake, but this\
  \ adventure was not for nothing. With the moon as our only light, we clumsily followed\
  \ Chico down to the base of the volcano.  \n\nAs I sat in the backseat of the taxi,\
  \ I looked over my shoulder to take one last mental photograph of my guardian, Chico.\
  \ But he had gone, just as quietly as he had appeared."
