Text: "By this point we had been in Bangkok for about 3 days.\nI don't know how much\
  \ you know about Bangkok but there are a lot of things to see and do.\nWith only\
  \ a few days left in the enormous city we were getting a tad stressed.\nWe got out\
  \ of bed, after a little sleep-in (we were on holiday after all) and ran outside\
  \ to get the train that we thought was only a little walk away.\nIn case you ever\
  \ think anything is a short walk at 12 PM in Bangkok, it is not! The sun was right\
  \ above us and we almost passed out as we walked out of the air-conditioned hotel.\
  \ Both me and my travel companion had too much pride to admit it was too hot to\
  \ walk so there we were, struggling towards the train to get to the Grand Palace.\
  \ We felt bad for sleeping in so we decided against buying breakfast, water, coffee,\
  \ anything at all. Not very wise. Not at all wise.\n\nWe finally got to the train\
  \ and then some bus and then finally we found our way to a temple, after of course\
  \ being told by a few shady Tuk-tuk drivers that the temple was closed but that\
  \ they would happily take us shopping(...). Declined. \nWe had a look at the reclining\
  \ Buddha while feeling the sun getting hotter (if that was even possible). We had\
  \ a look at our map and saw that the Grand Palace was really close by (as if in\
  \ that sun) so we decided to go for it but maybe have some food on the way.\nThe\
  \ hike started and there were no food stalls in sight. \n\nThe Grand palace and\
  \ the temples around are all enclosed in this area with guards surrounding it so\
  \ once you enter you kind of just have to go look at it all (that's what we thought\
  \ anyway). We entered the secured area, hungry as ever, thirsty as ever and hot\
  \ as ever. Pretty much we thought we were going to die on the spot. We started walking\
  \ aimlessly cause we knew we had to eat or drink something or we would actually\
  \ pass out. After what felt like an hour we saw a people in black everywhere going\
  \ into what looked like a market. Then the same black dressed people started putting\
  \ food and iced coffee in our hands, we tried to give them money, they shook their\
  \ heads and said \"Free, Free!\".\n\nA lady gave us a potato looking blob (I think\
  \ it was something else) and told us that they have the food for the Thai people\
  \ in remembrance of their dead king. \"Usually only for Thai, but today we invite\
  \ you\". I was close to tears at that point, maybe it was the heat or the tasty\
  \ blob or the kind people that saved me from passing out at the entrance of the\
  \ grand palace."
