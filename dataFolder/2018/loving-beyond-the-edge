Text: "I met Rodrigo during my exchange in the city of Valencia, Spain. It was love\
  \ for the first sight. We started dating quickly and our relationship became intense\
  \ in a few weeks. Like me and almost any Brazilian living abroad, he was crazy about\
  \ the idea of exploring other countries in Europe. We had the feeling that it was\
  \ our duty to take advantage of that semester to travel as much as we could across\
  \ the old continent. \nLife with Rodrigo was full of new experiences and I became\
  \ passionate to that vivacity. One day, he asked me if I would like to do a bike\
  \ trip with him. It was the end of our exchange semester and we were soon returning\
  \ to Brazil. In our schedule, we had only five days left between two other planned\
  \ trips: a week in Croatia and a Rock festival in Bilbao. Rodrigo said it was not\
  \ a problem. He had the dream of cycling over the Way of Santiago and we could adapt\
  \ the itinerary for the five days we had. \nAlthough I did not know how to cycle,\
  \ I omitted this information from him and accepted the proposal. After some research\
  \ in the Internet, we rent two bicycles and decided our trip itinerary. We were\
  \ going from Valencia to Santander and from there to Ponferrada by bus. In Ponferrada\
  \ we would pick up our bikes at the post office. From Ponferrada to Santiago de\
  \ Compostela by bike it would be around 250km. \nArriving at the post office of\
  \ Ponferrada, Rodrigo and me were taken care by Adolfo, the local employee who was\
  \ very curious about our trip. Adolfo gave us our bikes and helped us to assemble\
  \ the parts. In the meanwhile, he told us how experienced he was on doing the Way\
  \ of Santiago, and gave us some practical advices. Rodrigo and me were anxious for\
  \ starting the trip. However, before getting on the bikes, Adolfo noticed we were\
  \ using backpacks. Worried, he asked us if we were planning to do our trip carrying\
  \ the backpacks in our backs. We then realized how stupid and nonsense that was.\
  \ What should we do? Should we give up before even starting? Then, Adolfo saved\
  \ our lives. He got two thick strings and, with durex, he tied very tightly the\
  \ backpacks on the back of each bike. For five days, we left our backpacks tied\
  \ in the bicycle structure. Thanks to Adolfo, we have our backbones today. And not\
  \ just that. After I got on the bike, Adolfo did not take long to notice there was\
  \ something wrong with me. He asked me to change the bike's gait and I froze. He\
  \ helped me and with a five minutes tutorial I managed to survive a five days bike\
  \ trip."
