Text: "When I hear the name, images of a mad scientists\u2019 laboratory on a stormy\
  \ night flash through my mind. But instead of a laboratory, a hostel near the cloud\
  \ forest reserve of Monteverde awaits my discovery. Tarsicio and his wife Marianela\
  \ show me around the premises, and over a bowl of freshly cut fruit I learn that\
  \ my host has a love for architecture and has designed and built both the hostel\
  \ as well as the eccentric and brilliant octagonal shaped family home across the\
  \ garden that I am invited to view one evening himself.\n\nThe simple, minimalist\
  \ wooden design of the two houses incorporates ecological principles. In the garden,\
  \ recycle materials are used to border flower beds, and a friendly cat slinks around\
  \ banana trees. An old piano that the eldest daughter used to play stands in one\
  \ corner, a guitar and a few books in another. In the evening I play a few half-forgotten\
  \ melodies on the piano, the notes drifting softly over the hillside where a white\
  \ horse is grazing in the moonlight.\n\nTarsicio and I continue to have some inspired\
  \ conversations in a creative version of Spanglish. I learn that he and Marianela\
  \ are both artists and moved here from Ecuador 25 years ago. They wanted to immigrate\
  \ to Canada when Tarsicio passed through Monteverde and fell in love with it, so\
  \ they bought a piece of land, built the houses, raised their children and ran a\
  \ successful art gallery. They had elected an artists\u2019 life, doing sculptures\
  \ and pictures and could not imagine living any other way. When I ask if I can see\
  \ some of their art, I get the somewhat embarrassed reply that there is none left.\
  \ The financial crisis of 2008 changed their fate. No one had money to spare for\
  \ art, and as the months went by with the couple burning through their savings and\
  \ running out of means to provide for their family, they were forced to sell all\
  \ pieces and the gallery far below its value. Seeking solutions, they decided to\
  \ convert one building into a guesthouse. Tarsicio and Marianela jumped in at the\
  \ deep end, as they had no hospitality industry experience, but they quickly learned\
  \ how to swim. They are natural hosts, attentive, friendly, patient, respectful,\
  \ and the couple greatly enjoys meeting new people and learning about their culture\
  \ and lives.\n\nIn a sense Marianela and Tarsicio are still artists, practicing\
  \ the great art of turning lemons into lemonade, adapting to life and leaving the\
  \ visitor with a smile at the memory of their wonderful hospitality."
