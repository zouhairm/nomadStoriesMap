Text: "I looked out the window of our truck, my eyes filled with glaring whiteness,\
  \ as if we were progressing within a well-lit, blank canvas. Beaming with euphoria,\
  \ I turned left to my fellow traveler and observed that his expression matched my\
  \ own. Our situation seemed too surreal for us to be the ones experiencing it. Our\
  \ small party was currently traversing Langj\xF6kull, Iceland's second largest glacier,\
  \ with two local Icelandic guides en route to deep glacier caves.  These caves were\
  \ once only open to the scientists who made them, but as of 2010, they have been\
  \ opened to the travelers wishing to explore their depths.\nWhen the truck came\
  \ to a stop, we dismounted and shuffled into a narrow, metal chute descending into\
  \ darkness. Soon, the coarse, metal walls gave way to smooth ice and we equipped\
  \ our boots with ice-gripping crampons. As we walked ever deeper into the glacier,\
  \ the stark, white seemed to glow brighter and brighter until finally we reached\
  \ an open cavern. A collective gasp swept through our party as we took in the scene\
  \ around us.  From within the walls came a radiating light that flowed and morphed\
  \ in a way that mimicked those northern lights that this country is so well-known\
  \ for. The engineers that designed these tunnels seamlessly incorporated color changing\
  \ lights within the very structure of cave. The effect was both mesmerizing and\
  \ other worldly. \nOur celestial lights continually guided our journey, until we\
  \ came to a modest chapel carved from the ice. Here our guides were able to show\
  \ us how they measured the changing of the ice and how they knew how the ice will\
  \ look in the coming years.\nAfter brief silence, our female guide slowly began\
  \ to sing . From her mouth came Krummavisur, a traditional icelandic folk song.\
  \ She was soon joined by  her male compatriot and their harmonic ballad swept through\
  \ the tunnels, filling our ears and hearts. The echoes of the tunnel soon multiplied\
  \ their voices into a heavenly choir. Still surrounded by those heavenly lights,\
  \ each of us hopeful travelers were brought to a place outside of us. In that moment,\
  \ we heard the past while seeing the future; we were buried deep within the ice\
  \ while encompassed by lights from the heavens.  It was junction in time that transcends\
  \ physical experience.\nAs their lullaby closed, our guides began to usher us out\
  \ of the tunnel, back into the snow. With reluctance, each of us exited, understanding\
  \ that forever Langj\xF6kull would keep a portion of us within its depths."
