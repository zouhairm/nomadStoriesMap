Text: "I had been dreaming for a long time of travelling keeping art as my north star,\
  \ mixing ingredients to find the magic potion and share it onwards, I want to believe\
  \ that keeping the identity of the local culture is the global future.\nI decided\
  \ to listen deep inside myself, to take the string lying tangled inside of me and\
  \ to weave a new story. That\u2019s why I decided to live in an aboriginal town\
  \ in the center of Australia to connect with art. On my way I started to feel the\
  \ changes within myself. Looking up at the blanket of stars above, alone in the\
  \ middle of this vast nature something broke and I knew that the girl full of fears\
  \ had been left behind. \nMy destination was Yuendumu, a town of a population that\
  \ doesn\u2019t reach a 1000 in the mysterious and remote outback. The majority is\
  \ from Warlpiri tribe, they were ancient desert keepers, and there were also about\
  \ 400 dogs that barked the whole day. Giving the place a distinct sound. The town\
  \ is about 15 blocks, 3 shops, a school and the art center.\nThe art center is the\
  \ center of the town. The majority of those who paint are women of all ages. Although\
  \ at first it was difficult to engage, over time I made friendships. They gave a\
  \ skin-name \u201CNakamara\u201D and took me into their family structure.\nTheir\
  \ Art is known as \"the little dot\", it is a way of seeing the world, looking at\
  \ it from above. They say \"dream time\", but it doesn\xB4t refer to being asleep,\
  \ rather well awake with other eyes. They paint expressing stories about their past\
  \ and teachings this is how they pass on knowledge from generation to generation.\n\
  I thought that the loneliness of the desert would bore me, but I learned that boredom\
  \ is a choice. There was always a new adventure to go on. Like learning how to cook\
  \ kangaroo tail in a traditional way. They dig a hole in the earth, make a fire,\
  \ wrap up the meat, put it in the ground and then cover it with earth. Sitting on\
  \ the ground half the town came by to chat with us. There is no part of the day\
  \ that isn\u2019t social. \n\nThere is an expression that says \"In the least expected\
  \ places you will find the best people\u201D. The Aussie outback is a surprise on\
  \ each step, and I had the pleasure of crossing paths with incredible people that\
  \ inspired me. As I always say, places are made by the people. I don\u2019t know\
  \ if it was the intense color of the soil or the heat of the desert that seemed\
  \ to make it pulsate, Australia has many faces, like its endless routes, but this\
  \ is where it\u2019s heart lies."
