Text: "It was July. Humidity and heat clung like a child to mother. Sitting alone,\
  \ was a Japanese man, chestnut skin and an oversized backpack. Within the majesty\
  \ of Maruyama Park he stood out in shabby clothes. I sought reprieve in the shadow\
  \ of a sign detailing the history of Kyoto\u2019s oldest park, a once desolate area\
  \ in 1886 turned nationally designated Place of Scenic Beauty after its transformation\
  \ in 1913. The carved stone bench, beneath the shade of a shirakasakura, famed weeping\
  \ cherry tree, looked enticing.\n\n\u201CMay I sit?\u201D realizing too late he\
  \ wouldn\u2019t understand my English. Looking up from his hunched position, he\
  \ smiled, with sweat beading along his fading hairline, \u201CHai,\u201D gesturing\
  \ to the empty space.\n\n\u201CYou\u2026 America?\u201D he inquired, getting out\
  \ a small stack of paper from within the clutter and clothing of his bag.\n\n\u201C\
  Yes. Have you been?\u201D\n\nWith weathered hands, he creased and folded his paper.\
  \ \u201CIt is\u2026 dream. To America\u2026 I always want go there.\u201D His voice\
  \ was melodic, rhythmic, despite the low gravel. Fingers swaying like the branches\
  \ of trees, he focused. In broken English he recounted learning the language for\
  \ the sole purpose of going to America one day. Until he quit school to help his\
  \ family in the rice field, and struggled to find friends to practice. A dream,\
  \ even now, he carries in his heart.\n\nIn this sacred city of Kyoto, a place of\
  \ nearly 1.5 million people, here just outside the 1350 year old Yasaka Shrine,\
  \ at the base of the eastern mountains, it would seem easy for a foreigner to feel\
  \ lonely. But sitting next to this man, talking of America, I felt at home. It was\
  \ the very same heat in Florida, with ducks, here the Eastern Spot-Bill, waddling\
  \ into sculpted koi ponds, skittering pigeon feet on cobble seeking discarded crumbs,\
  \ and the wafting of fresh cut grass. \n\n\u201CFor you.\u201D\n\nI marveled at\
  \ the small floral crane in my palm. With worn shoes, the man stood, then bowed\
  \ slightly, \u201CThank you\u2026 for listen.\u201D\n\n\u201CWait! What is your\
  \ name?\u201D \n\nFrom his pocket he pulled a small rectangular card with cream\
  \ yarn tied to the top. He wrote in Kanji, \u658E\u85E4 \u9686, beneath that, Takashi\
  \ Saito. Bowing once more, he was off on his journey anew.\n\nMaruyama may be nationally\
  \ acclaimed, but it\u2019s not the surroundings that made it magical. It was the\
  \ beauty of Saito, willing to give a piece of his everything to a stranger, a gift\
  \ forged through gratitude in something as simple as being heard. All I could feel\
  \ was my own gratitude, and as though I was holding a piece of another home."
