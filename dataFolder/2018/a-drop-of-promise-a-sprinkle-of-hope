Text: "Sweat drips off my forehead as I fiddle with the hand pump, trying my best\
  \ to extract even a drop of water, but in vain. At a little distance, Neema eyes\
  \ me impassively, as if aware of the sheer futility of my attempts. In this hamlet\
  \ of rural Maharashtra, India, Neema and her husband Sanjay are considered extremely\
  \ lucky by most people, to have a hand pump within walking distance from their cottage\
  \ in a region where most women have to walk at least 3 miles, multiple times a day\
  \ only to fetch water.\nHowever, what these people don't know is that this hand\
  \ pump hasn't blessed them with as much as a drop of water in what seems like years.\
  \ As her baby, lying in a makeshift hammock, wails in the heat, there isn't enough\
  \ water at home to sprinkle on her face. The cattle have to satiate themselves with\
  \ the little moisture in the peels of the raw mangoes the couple grow in their field.\n\
  Neema knows I'm from the nearby metropolitan, traveling through these villages,\
  \ trying to develop a solution to the grave problem of water scarcity and impurity.\
  \ The first time I met her, I saw hope in her eyes and in those of several other\
  \ villages, only to have it turn into this identical impassive look on their faces.\n\
  I walk to her porch and extract my water bottle from my bag. I sprinkle a few drops\
  \ on the baby's face and some on the nearby ground, to keep the area cool. I then\
  \ hand her the bottle, along with two water purification pills. \n\"Put one in the\
  \ water, it'll purify it till tomorrow\", I tell her. \nShe does so without a word,\
  \ the slightest beginning of a smile playing on her lips, with the arrival of even\
  \ the little water, which means she can wait to fetch water till Sanjay gets home,\
  \ and wouldn't have to leave the baby alone, or worse, carry her along. She empties\
  \ whatever little is left into the cattle's water tank.\nI have to take her leave\
  \ now, to visit other nearby villages and scout for potentially useful water sources.\n\
  She knows I'll be back the next day, with a little water and a new contraption-\
  \ pills or tiny filters, or maybe this time, a long-lasting solution.\nShe smiles,\
  \ a full smile, as I embark upon the rest of my day, but not without the added weight\
  \ (and temptation) of a dozen fresh, raw mangoes."
