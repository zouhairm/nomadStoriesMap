Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t get me wrong. You\u2019re nice and everything, but I want\
  \ a real man\u201D I could still hear her say. \nIt had been a year since my girlfriend\
  \ and I had broken up, after I had found her in my bed with one of the students\
  \ from school. This had been her justification, which had since brought with it\
  \ a series of insecurities and prolonged depression. \n\u201CYou need to get out\
  \ more\u201D a friend had suggested. So here I was in Pattaya, Thailand, aboard\
  \ a bus to the Sanctuary of Truth, a famous Thai temple; and yet all I could think\
  \ of were the memories I was trying to get away from. \nI was jolted back to the\
  \ present by the commotion caused by dozens of passenger deboarding. We had arrived.\
  \ I stood up and followed the herd. \nThen my life changed forever. \nAgainst the\
  \ setting sun, I slowly made out the formidable form of this humongous work of art\
  \ which was this traditional Thai temple. It rose skywards with seven intricate,\
  \ gable-roofed levels, richly decorated with wooden carvings. The polished teak\
  \ structure shone golden in the glow of dusk, as the last of daylight seemed to\
  \ lick its way into every crevice of the building.\n\u201CBeautiful, isn\u2019t\
  \ it?\u201D \nI noticed a winsome, young Thai woman standing beside me, her light\
  \ brown eyes bright with marvel. \n\u201CIt is\u201D I nodded. \nAs I moved to explore\
  \ the interiors, I noticed how every last inch of the building was covered with\
  \ ornate imagery of Gods, Demons and everything imaginable to man, with the whole\
  \ complex surrounded by the lush green Chon Province. \nI was lost in admiration,\
  \ and before I knew, the sun had long set.\nI decided to head back to the bus stand\
  \ before I missed the last bus, when I noticed the Thai woman standing on the opposite\
  \ side. Our eyes met for but a split second before her bus arrived, and hid her\
  \ from view. Moments later, so did mine; with it the realization that I might never\
  \ see those light brown eyes again. \nIn that moment I reflected upon how, back\
  \ at the temple, standing between so many Gods and magical creatures, I had found\
  \ not one pedestal upon which I could kneel and pray. \nIt was then that it struck\
  \ me; the magic of this temple lay not in the promise of making our prayers and\
  \ dreams come true. It lay in reminding us that God had already given us the power\
  \ to do it ourselves.\nSo I stood there. Watched my bus leave. Mine, and hers.\n\
  Both sides of the station were now deserted. Except that I still stood on my side.\
  \ \nAnd on the other, so did she.\nYesterday we celebrated our first anniversary\
  \ together."
