Text: "I will never forget those eyes. Peeking out from the door of a dilapidated\
  \ hut were two piecing windows into heart and soul. They spoke of poverty. Of disease.\
  \ But of relentless joy. \n\nMy time in Laos had just begun. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ what I would find in that small village high up on the top of the mountain. I\
  \ had known of it for a few months as I planned the trip to check in on our ongoing\
  \ sustainability and water projects, but nothing could have prepared me for the\
  \ reality of what was in front of me. I had been exposed to completely foreign cultures,\
  \ languages, and lifestyles. The children marveled at my camera and light skin and\
  \ followed me around trying to understand where I had come from and why I was there.\n\
  \nThe eyes belonged to a young girl, four years old at most. She was dressed in\
  \ tattered rags and had her head shaved due to an aggressive lice epidemic. I wanted\
  \ to know her story. Where were her parents? Why didn\u2019t she have shoes like\
  \ the other children? Unable to communicate in the local dialect, all I could do\
  \ was wonder. \n\nEating lunch one day, I watched the children play soccer together\
  \ in the middle of the cluster of stilted huts. In pure camaraderie, they played\
  \ without teams or points. \u201CJust for fun\u201D, the village leader said. I\
  \ made eye contact with the girl. She motioned to me, as if she wanted me to join\
  \ them. I slowly made my way over, not wanting to misread her cue. \n\nInvited into\
  \ the game, I now had a chance to connect with the girl and her friends. In a moment,\
  \ a simple game of soccer broke down the barriers that language, skin color, and\
  \ socioeconomic status had uninvitedly constructed. We spent hours passing the ball\
  \ around and laughing with each other when we tripped or missed the goal. When we\
  \ needed a break, we shared meals together and pumped water from the well. \n\n\
  Somewhere on the other side of the world is a young girl who made me realize that\
  \ life is about holding on to what you have. Exuding with hope for tomorrow from\
  \ a light deep within, her eyes shone bright with life and zeal for tomorrow. \n\
  \nWhen I reticently said goodbye a few days later, her eyes told another wordless\
  \ story: \u201CDon\u2019t worry about me. I\u2019m happy here.\u201D"
