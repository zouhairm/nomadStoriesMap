Text: "We walked in silence up the high mountain, saving oxygen, as we were still\
  \ wet from the previous river we fought through and too far behind. The only comfort\
  \ we had was the two men behind us on the trail, late as we were. We looked back\
  \ at them: one in his fifties, the other about our age, with the most peaceful expressions\
  \ on their faces, as if completely unaware of the time. They were wearing plastic\
  \ covers, carrying only a small bottle of water. If they were not so obviously locals,\
  \ I would assume them crazy. We must have looked silly ourselves: small girls, huge\
  \ packs, hasting for six steps then leaning over for breath, repeatedly. \u201C\
  You will get nowhere like this\u201D said the older man kindly through a thick mustache.\
  \ \u201CI am Tarik. That\u2019s my son.\u201D We nodded and introduced ourselves,\
  \ still climbing in front. \u201CLook\u201D he held my arm and pointed at my feet\
  \ \u201CSlow. Slow breath. Mountains need respect.\u201D It was impossible. We were\
  \ in a hurry. Behind that mountain laid the strongest river of the trek. We had\
  \ to cross it to get to our gear on the other bank, and the water was getting higher\
  \ by the hour. \u201CAren\u2019t you worried about the river? It is almost dark\u201D\
  \ I said, panting throughout the sentence. \u201CWhy? We are here now, not there.\
  \ When time comes, we cross anyway. Worrying won\u2019t help.\u201D He was genuinely\
  \ confused about my attitude. For the next silent hour of climb, I kept rolling\
  \ his sensible words in my tired mind, becoming much more aware of the views than\
  \ of the future obstacles. We arrived at the summit: ranges of peaks and saddles\
  \ stretched before us: Rocky Mountains covered in snow, shadowing endless valleys.\
  \ Moments like these were why we left home in the first place, but this time it\
  \ was going to be shorter than ever. We savored the view for a moment and headed\
  \ down, to meet the infamous river. I was freaking out silently, while they got\
  \ barefoot and pants less, and started searching for the widest, shallowest part\
  \ of the river.We were hardly as ready but we took their lead, short of breath for\
  \ a new reason. Before long, the two strong men were beside us, combining arms with\
  \ ours. \u201CWhat if we won\u2019t make it?\u201D I released a last anxious thought\
  \ to the air. \u201CThat is not a very good thought\u201D Tarik smiled, tightened\
  \ his grip and started marching the human chain into the raging water. He was right\
  \ of course. I was ruining countless precious moments for nothing. When I made my\
  \ first step on the right side of the water, I promised myself never to forget this\
  \ lesson."
