Text: "I have been backpacking in Thailand for one month with limited rosources. Starting\
  \ from Bangkok, me and my travel mate took a flight to Krabi, where we tasted local\
  \ street food, and from there we took a ferry boat to Phi Phi Island, to enjoy some\
  \ good music and the amazing sea. We climbed up to the view point and snorkeled\
  \ with the local sea fauna.\nNot completely satisfied, we opted for another, more\
  \ remote, small island, Koh Lipe, where we stayed in a bungalow just 2 mins walk\
  \ from the beach. Close to a marine national park, we went on a long-tail boat day\
  \ to snorkel around the island. We enjoyed the peaceful state during the law season\
  \ and we got ready for the longest train journey we've done: from Hat Yai to Chiang\
  \ Mai. \nThe ferry transfer from Koh Lipe to Hat Yai happened in a stormy day and\
  \  we faced high waves on the route to the inland. I decided to go on the outside\
  \ of the boat to enjoy the feedom of the rain and the amazing view of the stormy\
  \ sea. \nThe train journey from south to north has been intervalled by a stop in\
  \ Bangkok, where we returned to the same hostel as the first time and refreshed\
  \ ourselves. On our way to Chiang Mai we witnessed the amazing panoramas that the\
  \ Thai rural areas offer. \nWe didn't spend much time in Chiang Mai, maybe a couple\
  \ of day, and we jumped on a van to Pai: this road has more than 700 curves uphill\
  \ in the mountains and lot of people feel sick during the journey. Thankfully, it\
  \ wasn't our case. \nIn Paid, we experienced the hippy atmosphere of this peculiar\
  \ place hidden in the Thai mountains. We went on a canyon, we visited when giant\
  \ white Buddha and we spent some time with the local elephant. In order to do all\
  \ of this, we rented a motorcycle upon arrival. painting isn't big, but it transforms\
  \ from day to night with lively street markets. Here, I also tattooed the symbol\
  \ of this experience in a local shop in the traditional way: a bamboo stick with\
  \ needles held together by some wax and string. \nDuring all the way back home,\
  \ I felt that I could never be the same again."
