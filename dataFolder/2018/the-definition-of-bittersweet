Text: "Everything was foreign. As soon as we sat down to the first place to eat, chopsticks\
  \ were put in our hands and a bowl of steaming noodle soup was placed in front of\
  \ us. We had just travelled for almost a full day, from our small hometown of Camden,\
  \ Maine, half-way across the world to the busy city of Ho Chi Minh, Vietnam. The\
  \ sidewalks were robust with people and the streets were filled with motorbikes\
  \ and then anything that could possibly be transported on them. This included families\
  \ of five, dogs, trees, mirrors, mattresses, and soon this turned into a fun game\
  \ of spotting the most eccentric objects. Soon, we were playing \u201Cfrogger\u201D\
  \ to cross the street to our school which meant not making eye contact with the\
  \ drivers, or they would take advantage and speed past. But all eyes were always\
  \ on us. It was uncommon to see many foreigners in District 11, where we lived.\
  \ Because of this, there was a wide range of emotion from the locals towards us.\
  \ At first we only received blank stares- some elderly people went as far as to\
  \ spit on us. Once they saw us in our plaid uniforms everyday, they understood we\
  \ were there to stay, and those stares turned to smiles. Before we knew it, we were\
  \ regulars at our local grocery, at the coffee shops and dinner places. We got to\
  \ know the talented ph\u1EDF girls who delivered the bowls by bicycle, one in each\
  \ hand, and the smoothie guy who knew I\u2019d either get strawberry or avocado.\
  \ And each time, he\u2019d attempt a new English word or sentence to say to me.\
  \ However, our six months were coming to a close and it was time to start packing\
  \ up our belongings. I had gotten so used to hand washing my own laundry in the\
  \ Vietnamese crouch, watching the morning exercisers in the park, walking down the\
  \ narrow fruit-market alley, haggling with the vendors, and I had even gotten used\
  \ to that sour, pungent, smell of the durian fruit that lingered in some streets.\
  \ The last thing I expected in that van ride through the city to the airport, was\
  \ the complex emotion of pure bittersweetness. As we drove by everything for the\
  \ last time, I pressed my hand to the glass and felt streaks of warm, salty, tears\
  \ fall down my face. I almost couldn\u2019t comprehend the overwhelming feeling\
  \ inside, of complete elation to return home, and then utter sorrow to be leaving\
  \ my newly made one. My home of busy streets and different faces, of foreign practices,\
  \ and amazing street food. Luckily, I brought home four cavities to remember the\
  \ deliciously sweet days of Vietnam."
