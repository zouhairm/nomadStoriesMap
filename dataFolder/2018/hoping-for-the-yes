Text: "Travelling is my dream. Specifically, travelling solo. \n\nWhy? \n\nWell, let's\
  \ just say travelling with my family can be\u2026tedious, whilst somehow also being\
  \ a whirlwind of rushing from one tourist magnet, snapping a photo with false, smiling\
  \ faces, and moving on to the next one. \nThat's just it. We're only ever looking;\
  \ never doing\u2026unless it's free and the attraction is worth the queue.\n\nI've\
  \ often thought: what's the point? Why are we here? With what we're doing we'd likely\
  \ be just as happy gazing at professional photographs of England, Tokyo or New York\
  \ for free; frankly an aesthetic much more beautiful than any photo my mum could\
  \ snap.\n\nHowever, if I could go alone, I'd make sure to disregard additional costs,\
  \ just do whatever tickles my interest, like hiking, bungee jumping, snorkelling\u2026\
  \ It would be anything I wanted; things that don't include standing on the sidelines,\
  \ snapping photos on my phone.\n\nHowever, there are many problems with this idea:\
  \ I'm barely an adult, my parents are protective as hell and my dad's the man to\
  \ go to for a blessing whenever anyone in the family has an idea or proposition\
  \ that isn't his. He's been committed to the idea that I go straight into university\
  \ to study Law now that I've finished high school, and I can't quite work out how\
  \ to ask his approval.\n\nNevertheless, I must break the news to him at some point\
  \ and I've decided, today's the day. Quite frankly, I'm 18 - when am I going to\
  \ stop letting my parents rule my life? \n\nBesides, I've already paid for my airfares\
  \ and deposited the money for my accommodation, I've even booked a two-week tour\
  \ of New Zealand and a month cruise along the west coastline of Australia. I can\
  \ do this. It's not like I'll be gone forever. Just long enough to appease my inner\
  \ travel guru!\n\n\nI've been amping myself up all day to tell them exactly this:\n\
  \"It's my life and I should get to decide what I do with it. At the moment, while\
  \ I'm young and capable, not anxious about twisting my ankle or breaking my back.\
  \ That's travelling.\nWhen I come back and I promise I will be, then I'll study\
  \ again. Maybe Law, or maybe I'll have changed my mind and I'll want to become a\
  \ doctor or an archaeologist. \nUntil then, I want to clear my mind; enjoy myself.\
  \ \nIt's my decision, and you can disagree with me, but that's your opinion...\n\
  \n\n\u2026And then came the moment of my declaration that I'd been dreading: the\
  \ response.\nThe last thing I expected was for mum to smile and dad to hug me to\
  \ his side; and for his answer to be 'Yes'."
