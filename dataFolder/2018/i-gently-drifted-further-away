Text: "I felt my fingers tingle and my stomach clench a little. Travelling amidst\
  \ the \u2018Padmavat\u2019 movie riots, when buses were being burnt down on every\
  \ other highway giving patient vandals employment, I wasn\u2019t too sure about\
  \ taking a beach holiday in the Southernmost tip of Gujarat. With an enormous rucksack,\
  \ I stood waiting for the bus, hoping it wouldn\u2019t be torched amidst my journey.\
  \ Despite my parents\u2019 efforts to bribe me out of the trip by seducing me with\
  \ a luxurious getaway if I complied, I wasn\u2019t enticed. I was eagerly looking\
  \ forward to revisiting a beach where I built endless sandcastles and collected\
  \ thousands of seashells\u2014currently occupying a huge fishbowl in my bedroom.\n\
  \nI reached the beach at after an eight-hour-long bus journey and was extremely\
  \ grateful for making it in one piece. I ate a semi-warm omelette with an extremely\
  \ sweet cup of coffee at a lovely sea-facing restaurant and didn\u2019t even realise\
  \ that my fork was seldom reaching my mouth and a little kitten who\u2019d found\
  \ refuge under my table was enjoying the bites the slid off of the fork. I was mesmerised\
  \ by a blue I was too familiar with, but somehow felt unfamiliar now. I realised\
  \ I couldn\u2019t wait any longer and found my way to the beach whose surf had coached\
  \ me in staying afloat. \n\nI looked for a familiar dome that was aligned with the\
  \ hotel I usually stayed at. The hotel was forced to close down on account of an\
  \ unpaid loan and hence, the once filled to the rafters beach lay isolated and neglected.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t complaining. I managed to cover half a kilometre in a mere five\
  \ minutes, letting my feet sink into the burning-noon sand. I lathered my skin with\
  \ a thick layer of sunscreen and ran straight into the foaming blue that greeted\
  \ my feet welcomingly. This was the first time I had travelled solo and I was a\
  \ little anxious about leaving my belongings unmonitored on the beach but there\
  \ was no one in sight for miles. That also tied my stomach in knots but each anxious\
  \ thought got swept away the higher the waves reached my body. I could hear my father\u2019\
  s voice in my head telling me \u201CThat\u2019s a bit too far out, come a little\
  \ closer,\u201D but that was just a voice in my head. I allowed the current to carry\
  \ me where it pleased. The glistening sunlight compelled me to close my eyes but\
  \ I still saw a bright red. I could hear the ocean and it sounded exactly like a\
  \ glass pressed to the ear. I never thought I\u2019d step foot into the sea that\
  \ once drowned an eight-year-old."
