Text: "I stepped on Albanian soil from Sveti Naum, Macedonian border cross point.\
  \ No queues, swift stamps in pasports and the Voila.  Before going to Albania I\
  \ had mixed feelings about this country. Stories about picturesque scenes were contrasting\
  \ with those of not so friendly behaviour towards foreigners. I even heard of tourists\
  \ being conned. \nMy final destination in Albania was the city of Shkoder which\
  \ was situated at the shores of the same-named lake on the Albanian-Montenegroan\
  \ border. I needed to cross entire country in order to get there. First, I got to\
  \ the capital,Tirana in two hours by a furgon. Poor road conditions did not let\
  \ enjoying marvelous countryside out of the window. Each time the driver increased\
  \ the speed my head was bumping to the roof of the car. But he was not the worst\
  \ one which I encountered in Albania. As soon as I reached Tirana I started looking\
  \ for another transport to Shkoder. One local resident promised to take me to the\
  \ nearest bus station. Barely speaking in English and communicating mostly via body\
  \ language we never got there.Instead he took me to his friend, a taxi-driver who\
  \ spoke no English at all. Actually he was not a taxi driver. Back home in Azerbaijan\
  \ we call such drivers \u201Ckhalturshiks\u201D i.d. people who provide taxi services\
  \ without official permission. Me and another tourist occupied last seats and we\
  \ set off. But before boarding I agreed to pay him 4 euros on arrival in Schkoder.\
  \ How surprised I was in Shcoder when he wanted me to pay in lek i.d. Albanian currency.\
  \ My surprise kept growing when I started converting the sum into euros. It came\
  \ out that he wanted me pay twice the fare. So we started complaining at each other.\
  \ I was doing it in English, him - in Albanian. It must have looked funny for by-passers.\n\
  We started looking for an unbiased third part. At last one English-speaking resident\
  \ decided to break a tie. When I explained him the issue he spoke with the driver\
  \ in Albanian which made the latter even more furious. But couple of minutes later\
  \ without further aggravation of alreary tense situation he got into his car and\
  \ drove away. Our mediator told me he was illegaly giving a ride for foreigners\
  \ and would be hugely fined in case police intervened into the case. So I think\
  \ he took a wise desicion. Perhaps you would take me for a greedy person. But wait\
  \ a second. We had a deal with him and his so-called hospitality spoilt my entire\
  \ percepton and expectations about Albanians, at least Albanian drivers."
