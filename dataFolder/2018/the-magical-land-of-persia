Text: "In May 2016, I met Ali, a young Persian man studying in the United Kingdom\
  \ for his PhD. I did not know a thing about Iran before, and his stories of flying\
  \ carpets totally turned me on... I asked him to take me to his country, and there\
  \ I was three months later, with my hijab and my camera. Ali's family welcomed me\
  \ in a beautiful flat in Tehran, with a typical breafkast i.e., naan bread, fresh\
  \ cheese, walnuts, tasty fruits, and chai tea. Tehran is a massive capital, crowded\
  \ by day and night.\n\nMy real Persian experience started when heading towards South,\
  \ to Shiraz... This is where I discovered wonderful bazaars with colorful Persian\
  \ carpets, many different spices, and extremely welcoming people. I was awed by\
  \ all these sensations, smells, tastes, feelings, welcomes. The city is home of\
  \ splendid mosques, with impressive colors, lights, decorations. We stayed at Masoud's,\
  \ our local host, who told us many stories about his city and made us taste the\
  \ best tea and food. Shiraz was also home of two famous Persian poets, Saadi and\
  \ Hafez. Their tombs are located in beautiful and relaxing gardens, where locals\
  \ read their poems and enjoy the shade under the tree leaves... When in Shiraz,\
  \ one also has to visit Persepolis, declared World Heritage Site by the UNESCO in\
  \ 1979. Its earliest remains date back to 515 BC! I felt so tiny while on site.\
  \ \n\nFrom Shiraz, we went to Isfahan, another city full of charms. Isfahan is indeel\
  \ also known as \"the half of the world\". The atmosphere in Isfahan was probably\
  \ my favorite, as I felt completely relaxed in the city. I discovered some other\
  \ mosques, as well as a very interesting architecture from the fifteenth century.\
  \ Isfahan was particularly busy during the evenings and nights, as Persians try\
  \ to stay indoors during the hot days of summer and enjoy life once the sun is down.\
  \ A funny story happened to me in Isfahan: I randomly ran into a Persian lady I\
  \ met in Canada! The world is so small. We all are citizens of the world. <3\n\n\
  I believe some people need to change their mind about Iran: it is not a dangerous\
  \ country at all. People are extremely welcoming, I felt a lot safer than in UK\
  \ or in Paris for instance. The Persian culture is amazing and very interesting.\
  \ I would love to go back to this pretty country some time soon."
