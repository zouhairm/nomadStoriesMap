Text: "\u2018Sophie, where are you? We are about to leave, meet us at the dive boat.\u2019\
  \nReplying with a quick \u201Cselfie\u201D of me sitting in my uncomfortable plane\
  \ seat at the start of my 25 hour journey back home, seemed like the best reply.\n\
  \u2018Hasta luego\u2019 were the last words I said to my dear Galapagos-Iguana dive\
  \ crew. Five guys with sun kissed skin, dark hair and the lung capacity of top athletes\
  \ developed a strangely enjoyable bond with this girl with sun burnt skin, sun bleached\
  \ hair and the lung capacity of a fish, who never really got the chance to say goodbye.\
  \ Goodbyes are not for me, they are too final and as a traveler I prefer to say\
  \ \u2018see you soon\u2019.\n\nReminiscence of 16 hours before: a million bubbles\
  \ flare up on the ocean\u2019s surface right before 6 divers surface with great\
  \ grins on their faces and electricity running through their bodies. Diving connects\
  \ more than anything else. The miracles seen underwater cannot be put in words and\
  \ pictures do not do them justice.  Roughly 46 minutes ago we fixated our masks,\
  \ inserted the regulators, held on to the weight belt with one hand and with one\
  \ step entered into the blue. Resting at 20 meters below the atmosphere where humans\
  \ are able to breathe we are swallowed by a shoal of rainbow fish, as a school of\
  \ rays passes beneath us. \nCovered in a washed-out salty towel, eating buttery\
  \ cookies the youngest crew member challenged me to climb up to the roof of the\
  \ dive boat. Without really noticing, the boat started its 2 hour journey back to\
  \ shore. \nSitting there on top of that dive boat, watching the sun set over the\
  \ horizon, the drilling sound of the motor swallowing our conversation, we became\
  \ friends. \nHe never went to University, he barely finished high school but he\
  \ followed his dream of becoming a dive master. In that exact moment he helped me\
  \ realize that life is about living in the moment and doing what makes you happiest.\
  \ He communicated with passion, the happiness just exceeding him in any possible\
  \ way. On that dive boat happiness came looking for me and I inhaled it all. A smirk\
  \ did not leave my face until weeks after, when reality finally caught up and I\
  \ realized that seeing them would not be as soon as planned."
