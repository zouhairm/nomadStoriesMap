Text: "I tightened my hands on the steering wheel; we were going through another one\
  \ of the 1000+ tunnels that dot the landscape of Norway. My friend, Lindsay, was\
  \ asleep in the passenger seat.\n\nWhen we started this adventure we knew nothing\
  \ of what would come. We were searching for the gravesite of Lindsay's grandfather.\
  \ Once Lindsay's mother found out that we were traveling to Norway she made Lindsay\
  \ promise that she would try to find her grandfather's resting place in the small\
  \ town of Feda, a lovely village of 400 people, only two hours from where we were\
  \ staying.\n\nWe drove through a tunnel, then over a bridge, then through another\
  \ tunnel, then another bridge, and then down a long, winding mountain road. I wish\
  \ I could write that the sun streamed down upon us and we found Lindsay\u2019s grandfather\
  \ with ease, however that was not the case. Stepping out of the car was shocking,\
  \ breathing the cold air paradoxically left me breathless. It was very cold and\
  \ heavily raining. The entire village and all 400 people were engulfed in a cloud.\
  \ It was impossible to see the top of the fjord that surrounded us. We were soaking\
  \ wet after just a few minutes of searching through the graveyard.\n\nWe were making\
  \ our third round through the cemetery. We had found Lindsay's great-grandparents,\
  \ but there was no sign of the grandfather's gravesite for which Lindsay's mother\
  \ wanted a photograph. We drove all this way and we surely weren't leaving without\
  \ a photo of the grave.\n\nWe were about to give up. I was making a final pass and\
  \ reexamining each headstone, some that were many hundreds of years old, to find\
  \ any clue of where her grandfather was buried. I turned around and saw Lindsay\
  \ approaching an older couple outside the church.\n\nShe spoke softly, \"Hi, I'm\
  \ looking for a grave. Do you know where Jahn Svindland is buried?\"\n\nThe woman\
  \ appeared shocked and said, \"Yes, he was my uncle.\"\n\nI tried to explain in\
  \ my broken Norwegian that Jahn was Lindsay's grandfather, making the two women\
  \ first cousins once removed. We spent the rest of the afternoon with the Svindland\
  \ family, even Facetiming Lindsay's mom so she had the chance to meet her relatives.\
  \ We walked to the house where her grandfather grew up and they took a family photo.\
  \ We soon parted ways, with Lindsay adding her extended relatives on Facebook and\
  \ promising to keep in touch. \n\nOddly enough, Lindsay's grandfather wasn't even\
  \ buried in Feda but we can surely say that the trip was more rewarding than we\
  \ expected."
