Text: "On my shoulder hangs a new leather holder. Inside is a copy of Suitcase magazine\
  \ and a mandatory set of toiletries. I came to breaking point only a week previously\
  \ and this was my way of dealing with it. Going and going solo. \L\LI knew that\
  \ if I were to ever have a chance of being published and escaping depression, it\
  \ was imperative that I finished my novel. I needed zero distractions in a quiet,\
  \ intimate setting with my head down and my thoughts wild for life again. And for\
  \ this, all I needed was the city of light. The city of Paris.\L\LSitting on my\
  \ apartments balcony, I open my trusty bilingual map, skimming the endless possibilities\
  \ of locations. I close my eyes, head in the sun and twirl my finger till it goes\
  \ dizzy, diving onto the surface of the paper. Solf\xE9rino, a metro station close\
  \ to the river Seine a little east of the Eiffel Tower. I\u2019m happy with that.\
  \ Alighting the stairs of the station with the tens of others around me, they swerve\
  \ and criss-cross in their already known directions. But I smirk in my uncertainty,\
  \ breathing in the open air. I tilt my neck, turning in a 360 degree pivot, absorbing\
  \ the architecture of a romanticism era, the Eiffel Tower striking proud in the\
  \ distance behind french, pigeon-littered rooftops. \L\LThere\u2019s sounds of busking\
  \ accordion players, bicycle bells and stilettoed foot steps upon the pavement,\
  \ they blow me away, literally with a continental breeze that wisps my hair with\
  \ the scent of freshly baked bread from across the street.\L\L I find my first,\
  \ rather posh Caf\xE9 and dive into Chapter fifteen. For three days straight I continue\
  \ to indulge in menus and words. \LHowever, on the morning of my fifth day in Paris,\
  \ three chapters later, I awaken to swollen eyes. A migraine so ripe that I can\
  \ barely lift my head above the pillow. \L\LI lose two and half days because of\
  \ the flare up, that I can only reason is a symptom of the continuous strain on\
  \ my eyes. I feel as though I have betrayed Paris, and neglected my book, my future.\
  \ Then, a news alert appears on my phone. \L\LDonald Trump has been elected President\
  \ of the United States. I\u2019m close to The Moulin rouge when I\u2019m finishing\
  \ the final paragraph of my final chapter. It took a lot of work and focus to get\
  \ to this point but I\u2019ve done it. The waiter brings my order of a celebratory\
  \ creme br\xFBl\xE9e and a white wine. It seems as though he wants to talk to me\
  \ but I\u2019m too engaged, too focused. \L\LWith a tear and hope for my future,\
  \ I write my last sentence. \L\L\u201CIt\u2019s the end of the world, my friend.\u201D"
