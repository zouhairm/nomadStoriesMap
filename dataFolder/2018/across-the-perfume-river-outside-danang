Text: "One night in Danang, Lotus and I take motorbikes along the stretch of road\
  \ near the ocean, where wind rocks tar-bellied fishing boats. Danang, two hours\
  \ south of Hue, is known for its imaginative bridges and modern feel. When asked\
  \ what she likes most about the city where she works as a maid, Lotus told me, \u201C\
  Money! Of course.\u201D \nTonight, we are visiting a Vietnamese man with cerebral\
  \ palsy whom Lotus calls \u201Cthe child.\u201D He lives in a village outside Danang,\
  \ past smoky fields of industry. We pull our masks tighter across our mouths and\
  \ tense over potholes. Eventually, the route angles past a grove of bamboo, and\
  \ we arrive in front of a one-floor residence, open like all in Vietnam. A woman\
  \ sits silent beneath a smoking Catholic altar, next to \u201Cthe child,\u201D named\
  \ Lap. When Lotus bends to speak with Lap, he dips and lifts his head, turning thoughtful\
  \ brown eyes to the ceiling. He is no larger than a child of ten.\nLotus has spoken\
  \ often about autism in her country. Many of her friends are fearful of having an\
  \ autistic child. In rural areas of Vietnam, autism is seen as demonic possession\
  \ or a curse. But Lotus has been silent when it comes to individuals with disabilities\
  \ here.\nLap turns his eyes to me. \u201CHow are you?\u201D he says. He moves on\
  \ his knees to plug in a fan. Although language of any kind is difficult to articulate,\
  \ Lap keeps up with Lotus\u2019s banter and studies our lips to learn new vocabulary:\
  \ shoes, water, trees, friends. \nLotus has told me she wants to save money to buy\
  \ Lap a computer. With a computer, he will finally be able to study his own language.\
  \ But she is afraid his family will simply sell the device for profit. \nAs we speak\
  \ with Lap, the mother sits and frowns. Lap's jeans are torn at the kneecaps from\
  \ crawling on the floor.\nLotus points to me: \u201CIs she pretty?\u201D she asks\
  \ in Vietnamese, and Lap nods his head. \u201CWhat about me?\u201D Khong, Lap says.\
  \ Ye tuan qua! \u2013\u201Cextremely beautiful!\u201D We laugh, sitting next to\
  \ Lap and waiting for the sky to grow orange.\nWhen it is time to leave, the mother\
  \ stands and walks to a back room. Lap watches us depart, craning his neck until\
  \ the last possible moment.\nOn the return drive, Lotus doesn't say anything about\
  \ Lap. Like others I\u2019ve met in Vietnam, she does not dwell on difficulty. She\
  \ speeds faster than before and tosses Vietnamese phrases at me: \u201CDo you have\
  \ a sweetheart? Where\u2019s your honey tonight?\u201D \nIn the cool flicker of\
  \ Danang lights, we are breathless, playful once again within the limitless bounds\
  \ of language."
