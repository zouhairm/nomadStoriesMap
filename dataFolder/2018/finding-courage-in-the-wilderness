Text: "My first experience of long term travel was when I left university and embarked\
  \ on a 3 month trip across the States. I had all the usual feelings of nerves, excitement\
  \ and trepidation, not knowing what was ahead but looking forward to all the new\
  \ experiences to come. From attending Mardi Gras in New Orleans to staying with\
  \ Najavo Indians in Monument Valley to sightseeing in the Big Apple, we really packed\
  \ it all in. With each day and experience our confidence grew and we thought we\
  \ were invincible. After one long driving day we decided to stop off at a national\
  \ park and do one of the walking trails. We arrived at Table Rock National Park\
  \ in South Carolina. We set out on the first trail we saw with visions of a nice\
  \ little stroll, maybe ending up at the waterfall we\u2019d heard so much about.\
  \ A little dip and a picnic, that\u2019s what idyllic travelling days are all about\
  \ right? We were walking and walking never reaching the waterfall and did talk about\
  \ turning back but we ploughed on regardless. Soon it was dark and we could no longer\
  \ see the markers directing us which way to go so if we turned back we wouldn\u2019\
  t have a clue where we were going. By this point we were both getting creeped out,\
  \ 2 girls alone in a pitch black forest, perfect setting for a horror movie right?\
  \ Would a bear stumble upon us accidentally or come up behind us and savage us in\
  \ a vicious attack? We were terrified. If you\u2019d have told me beforehand I was\
  \ going to be in this situation I would\u2019ve predicted that I would be hysterical,\
  \ an emotional sobbing, panicking mess. But this is when I surprised myself by staying\
  \ calm and thinking of the most logical way of getting us out of this situation.\
  \ I was on complete auto pilot and determined to not die here, eaten by a bear on\
  \ my once in a lifetime trip. With no signal on our phones, the only thing we could\
  \ do was call the emergency services. Believe me, I felt so stupid and embarrassed\
  \ dialling 911 but there really was no other option. Luckily they sent the park\
  \ ranger to come and get us, he arrived a couple of hours later (during which we\
  \ sat on the ground huddled together freaking out that every twig breaking was a\
  \ black bear stalking us). Soon enough we were in his truck and he delivered us\
  \ safely back to our car where we drove back into civilisation vowing to never be\
  \ so stupid again. What the experience did teach me about myself though is I can\
  \ keep calm under pressure and not crack in intense situations."
