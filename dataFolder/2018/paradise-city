Text: "Craic in Ireland means fun. So, when a Brazilian friend living in Dublin warned\
  \ me my hotel was in a neighborhood nicknamed \xB4Crackolandia\xB4 - I thought;\
  \ great, a land of craic!  Why was he being so dramatic? \n\n\u201CYou can\xB4t\
  \ go there. Stay with my family\u201D. \u201CI can\xB4t just invite myself!\u201D\
  \ I snapped defensively, annoyed not by the invitation but by the idea that I couldn't\
  \ protect myself.  \n\nAs night was falling, I finally arrived on rua Santa Efig\xEA\
  nia alone \u2013 only too aware that my stupid jokes had always been a way to cover\
  \ up my deepest fears.  \n\nThe tightness in my chest and throat subsided and S\xE3\
  o Paolo\xB4s inner city was becoming my new comfort zone. Next stop: nearby Paraisopolis\
  \ or 'Paradise City', where houses like uncomfortably stacked Lego blocks made from\
  \ peach-colored bricks and still visible mortar were covered with corrugated iron\
  \ over airy rooftops.  Small colorful shops on narrow and busy streets below contrasted\
  \ against the clear blue sky and the spacious, white and carefully constructed apartment\
  \ buildings circling the skyline. \n\nI sat on the 3rd floor rooftop, pondering\
  \ the structures of power and equality and my own cultural traditions as I sipped\
  \ on a never-ending Caipirinha and polished off a homemade Feijoada.\n\nThalita,\
  \ who was hosting me with her mother Angela, was studying her second degree \u2013\
  \ Architecture, doing an unpaid internship and working to pay for the private university\
  \ she had little choice but to attend. Her brother, working overtime and overseas\
  \ was helping too. \u201CLiving in the favela, I always wanted bigger and better\
  \ things\u201D she sighed. \u201C\u2026but without these streets, I would\xB4ve\
  \ never realized my passion for design and necessity.\u201D  \n\nI had never stayed\
  \ in a 5 star hotel before, but doubted they treated you as well as up in the hills\
  \ of Paraisopolis. That night, I had the best sleep of the whole trip. My bed was\
  \ small and simple and the bare concrete walls and bricks surrounding me ensured\
  \ a kind of natural air conditioning in the summer heat. There were no blood sucking\
  \ mosquitoes there either, like the ones who had been treating themselves to full-course\
  \ meals - on me, back in my hotel room. When I woke, I took a shower and used my\
  \ new robe, toothbrush and flip flops. Thalita had left a dress so I could change\
  \ out of my old clothes. \n\nAfter saying goodbye to my new friends and embarrassingly\
  \ but graciously accepting their parting gifts, I realized the importance of what\
  \ they had given me. I had stopped making stupid jokes."
