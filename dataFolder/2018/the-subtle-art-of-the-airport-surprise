Text: "Full of nervous energy, I fidgeted with the HAPPY-BIRTHDAY banner in my hands.\
  \ Would I pull this off? It felt like something that only happens in the movies.\n\
  \n\u201CSo, are you waiting for someone?\u201D\n\nThe question caught me off guard\
  \ and snapped me back to reality. \n\n\u201CI am\u201D I replied, ready to let someone\
  \ in on the surprise. \u201CHow did you know?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo one ever looks excited\
  \ to leave Las Vegas\u201D\n\nMy interrogator smiled softly and scanned the boarding\
  \ area. I did the same. \n\nNeatly uniformed gate agents worked with stoic efficiency\
  \ near rows of rigid steel-beam seating filled with weary travelers. The morning\
  \ sun seared through thick glass from the tarmac while drab nylon suitcases rolled\
  \ through the terminal in rhythm, melting into the sharp soundtrack of slot machines\
  \ whirring and dinging near the food court.\n\nI noticed how airports have this\
  \ detached, non-place quality to them. We retreat into our tech, searching for community,\
  \ the blue glow of our screens bathing us in familiar comfort. If someone asks,\
  \ \u201CHave you been to Minnesota?\u201D and you reply \u201Cjust the airport\u201D\
  \ it\u2019s universally agreed that doesn\u2019t count. \n\nWhich is why I was extra\
  \ excited about the plan I had in the works. Pulling off the extremely retro act\
  \ of surprising my sister right at her gate would breathe some sense of place into\
  \ this hangover holding tank. I had told Kate months before that I couldn't come\
  \ to Vegas for her 23rd birthday - work was busy, I would love to, but just couldn\u2019\
  t. Then I secretly booked my trip, packed a carry-on so I could stay within security\
  \ once I landed, and texted her over WiFi inflight to keep the rouse up. Everything\
  \ was going to plan.\n\nWaiting at her gate as her flight arrived, I was in full\
  \ birthday surprise mode, and ready to make a small scene.\n\nThe jetway opened\
  \ and arriving passengers breezed through. I lifted the birthday banner, and as\
  \ Kate spotted me, it was magic. Shock from seeing me out of context turned to excitement\
  \ then joy as we hugged at the gate. She couldn\u2019t believe I was there. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe it had worked out.\n\nAs we walked outside together into the arid Mojave\
  \ Desert air, buzzing with energy for the weekend, I felt an unexpected warm place\
  \ in my heart for a random gate in an airport that an hour before meant nothing\
  \ to me. Kate says even now, she always looks around her gate for familiar faces.\
  \ \n\nThe world felt a little smaller that day, knowing that a few secrets and good\
  \ timing could upgrade a non-place to the setting for a shared memory."
