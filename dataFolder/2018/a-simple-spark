Text: "The sweat and dirt covering my body ironically makes me feel more clean and\
  \ pure than the world of sterile hygiene chemicals at home in London. My days in\
  \ the rat-race are on pause as I have no desire and can see no sight of my return\
  \ to the \u2018comfort\u2019 of my western life. All I can think about is how blissfully\
  \ happy I am at this very moment in time as I look onto the Guatemalan streets of\
  \ San Pedro. We are sitting on the makeshift veranda and I can hear F\xE1tima breathing\
  \ heavily with concentration beside me as she parcels up masa dough using corn husks\
  \ for dinner. She is making tamales, like she has done for the previous forty-five\
  \ years. She has delegated the easier tasks to me of making Frijoles Volteados and\
  \ plantain.\n\nI met F\xE1tima one week earlier on my hitch hiking journey from\
  \ Xela to Chichicastenango. Fortunately I was collected by a young Guatemalan couple\
  \ (F\xE1tima and Dido) with a pick-up truck who were en route to \u2018Chichi\u2019\
  \ to attend the continent famous market to sell their colourful collection of vegetables.\
  \ I crouched in the back of the truck accompanied by tomatoes, courgettes, carrots\
  \ and eggplants rolling around my feet, and the dusty roadside air beating my face.\
  \ I could almost smell my excitement as we approached the bustling and vibrant streets\
  \ of the market. Fish, multi-coloured fleece\u2019s, pots, pigs feet, phone covers,\
  \ tortillas, hats, chickens. You couldn\u2019t dream up the array of what was on\
  \ offer on that cramped and friendly block of streets. The loud bartering and shouting\
  \ noises were blocked out by what my eyes were feasting on.\n\nUsing my modest Spanish\
  \ ability and their almost non-existent English we bonded immediately based on the\
  \ strange reality that we didn\u2019t need to break the ice by talking (as this\
  \ was impossible) but we were instead forced to communicate in more creative ways.\
  \ F\xE1tima and I, both being females in our mid-twenties, should have had a lot\
  \ in common but our lives were quite literally worlds apart. After much sign language\
  \ and shoulder-shrugging, F\xE1tima invited me to stay at their very humble home\
  \ in exchange for company and a helping hand. Our unique relationship based on non-verbal\
  \ communication blossomed as did my insight into their beautiful, simplistic lifestyle.\
  \ \n\nThis simple spark of friendship is incomparable to the familiar and shallow\
  \ friendship to which I have been accustomed. We connect on a fantastically unique\
  \ level of lack of common ground. Without words we can teach each other our different\
  \ universes."
