Text: "Having spent a quality time in the capital of the country , I was planned to\
  \ visit a place 2700 kms from Delhi which has nothing similar to it. At first i\
  \ was a little reluctant to accept it but today i consider it to be an opportunity\
  \ given to me as I explored the city.\nA few reasons to love it:\n\nThe Legendary\
  \ Marina\nIts the LONGEST beach in India. Evenings spent here are the best in Chennai.The\
  \ view is surreal , sky adorned with colorful skyshots. With evening snacks and\
  \ a cup of filter coffee watching waves roaring at the shore , the feeling is stellar.\n\
  \nVandalur Zoo- Largest & Oldest of its kind\nAlso called as Arignar Anna Zoological\
  \ Park , is said to be the LARGEST zoo of India in terms of area. Opened in 1855\
  \ as Madras Zoo houses Chitals , Lions , Elephants , Deers and More.Gives jitters\
  \ to watch them all.\n\nRoyapuram Railway Station\nHaving been to this was like\
  \ revisiting the colonial area. It is the OLDEST operational railway station of\
  \ India. The First trains to South India started from here.\n\nAnna Centenary Library\n\
  Chennai boasts of ASIA\u2019s LARGEST library . Its grand and systematically organized.\
  \ This 7 floored building has millions of books where each floor is dedicated to\
  \ specific subject, reading it and enjoying the ocean view in a centrally cooled\
  \ hall is a bliss\n\nAmma Unavagam (Mother\u2019s kitchen)\nWell i think its the\
  \ time to change the definition of pocket friendly foods . Now think of a place\
  \ where you could get an Idli for Re1.The government here takes care of each class\
  \ of people .They ensure everyone gets good quality food. And at this abysmal rates,\
  \ nobody would sleep hungry.\n\nWar Cemetry\nMade in the remembrance of those valors\
  \ who lost their lives during World War II . It has around 856 burials at one place.\n\
  \nCheapest Cinema Halls\nVelvet embellished movie hall. Must be expensive right!\
  \ Nope, that is where you are fooled . It just cost Rs 120 . Shocked ! Even i was\
  \ . Wait a minute i forgot to add they also have a ticket for Rs 10.\n\nBikers Paradise\n\
  Well if you are a biking enthusiast ,ride to it now .Chennai has got two most amazing\
  \ roads to ride viz OMR and ECR. Imagine speeding across the road which runs exactly\
  \ parallel to the beach\n\nThis is why i am in love with the city . As the famous\
  \ lyrics go, \u201CNamma Chennai Pola Vera Oore Illa\u201C. There is no chance to\
  \ find a place like Chennai."
