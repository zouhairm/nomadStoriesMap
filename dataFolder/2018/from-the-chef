Text: "Since I left home on my solo journey to London, I had probably uttered all\
  \ of 10 sentences to other human beings. When I left my apartment no one was home,\
  \ so I locked the door and whispered a quiet goodbye to the unit. At the airport;\
  \ \"Thank you\", \"No I am not checking a bag\". On the plane; \"Tomato juice and\
  \ water please\". \n\nWith wet feet and a tight grip on my polka dot umbrella, I\
  \ wandered the streets of London, England without aim or intention. Only stopping\
  \ for nourishment and the occasional espresso. I had a short timeline and I planned\
  \ to soak up as much of the city as I could, which I had already began to do through\
  \ the thin soles of my apparently very permeable shoes.\n\nEach night at the hostel\
  \ I quieted myself even more as I tried to leave my roommates undisturbed. At the\
  \ audition I attended, which was the reason I came at all, I uttered each word with\
  \ careful contemplation and the sole intent of leaving a shining impression. I sat\
  \ in the Adelphi Theatre on the West End and watched Kinky Boots in complete, silent\
  \ awe. Slightly drunken awe if I may add, as apparently alcohol portions in English\
  \ cocktails are far from modest. \n\nIt was my last night, and I wanted to find\
  \ something special for my final meal. London has a plentiful array of healthy on-the-go\
  \ options which kept me going through the trip, but I was ready to enjoy a sit down\
  \ meal before I said goodbye to the city. I had the advantage of not having a phone\
  \ in this moment. Normally, careful consideration and menu inspection would aid\
  \ in finding a suitable restaurant. But instead, I decided to make my choice based\
  \ on curiosity alone.\n\nI ended up at a pizza restaurant called Franco Manca, where\
  \ I was served by a warm french sounding man. I ordered the vegetarian special and\
  \ eavesdropped on the couple not two feet away from me while I gazed out the window,\
  \ waiting for my meal. \"From the chef\" he said when he dropped off my food. I\
  \ looked down at the table and saw a heart shaped pizza waiting for me. My face\
  \ smiled uncontrollably as the chef and other tables looked over at me. \"Somebody\
  \ likes you!\" The female half of the couple at the table to my right said to me.\
  \ She was almost as giddy about the heart shaped dough as I was. \n\nIt reminded\
  \ me of the many ways to connect besides through verbal communication. I spoke not\
  \ one word to the chef, but my ear-to-ear smile and empty plate showed my gratitude.\
  \ I realized that silence is not a lack of anything. It is an opportunity for something."
