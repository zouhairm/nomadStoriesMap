Text: "I was cocooned in my sleeping bag on the edge of a steep ravine. My hands clutched\
  \ the metal cup of tea I had just boiled from ice. In just a few moments, the sun\
  \ swam to the horizon, and pink cascades silhouetted the peak of Mt. Hood just above,\
  \ then Mt. Adams, Mt. Rainier, Mt. St. Helens and Lost Lake in the distance, with\
  \ a blanket of stars pulling away. For miles, the vast sea of bland earth tones\
  \ sparkled and turned into a vibrant kaleidoscope.\n\nMy brother had given me only\
  \ a day of warning, but I wanted to test myself. We took the US26 East toward Hood\
  \ early on the first saturday of August, 2017. At 11 am, we set feet on the Pacific\
  \ Crest Trail. Yocum Ridge was the goal. Our first obstacle was the Sandy River;\
  \ melted glacial water from the mountain. A mess of fallen logs span the river and\
  \ make the cross simple; though I did see a man fall into the river on my way back.\
  \ The trail then meanders to the crystal clear Ramona Falls. Our 40lb packs were\
  \ beginning to wear us down. \n\nThe trail is 9 miles in length, 3600\u2019 in elevation\
  \ gain. I must admit that we both seriously considered quitting. Five century-old\
  \ noble firs, hemlock and rocks jut out, closing in on a narrow dirt path all the\
  \ way. We were exhausted beyond thought, starving and sunburnt, but the endeavor\
  \ for discovery pushed us. On the last mile, the forest opened up to pristine meadows\
  \ of grass and lively wildflowers. We came upon a canyon, which on some longing\
  \ days with clear skies, I can still make out from a distance. Rolling hills and\
  \ mountain ranges beyond. Here we made camp. The only source of water is packed\
  \ ice scattered along the trail. Here we met others who were great company. I left\
  \ chapstick at home and my lips looked like tectonic plates. A kind, old woman gave\
  \ me hers. \u201CYou look like you need it more than I\u201D she said.\n\nThe night\
  \ came quick and cold. The stars were so bright I couldn\u2019t sleep. I sat up,\
  \ mesmerized. Portland city lights shone on the horizon. At 5 am, my brother awoke.\
  \ We gathered a few necessities and hiked a mile in the dark to another face of\
  \ the mountain.This northern face, as we soon learned, had better campsites. We\
  \ sat in wait. Deer walked below us in search of food. At 6, the sun broke through\
  \ the dreary fog, lighting up a new world.  The view was so surreal and beautiful\
  \ it brought tears to my eyes. We sat for hours, taking it in. I\u2019m more of\
  \ a sunset type of person, but to this day, that sunrise beats all the sunrises\
  \ and sunsets I care to remember."
