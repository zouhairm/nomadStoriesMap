Text: "After 1 week of hiking I take heart, turn around and look into the eyes of\
  \ our porter Dorji Nangmang Sherpa: \u201ECould you please try to not spit right\
  \ behind me?\u201CI ask.His face tells me that he\u2019 s unsettled.I add:\u201E\
  I mean\u2026you can spit anywhere\u2026but I really can\u2019t stand it that close\
  \ to me.\u201D That won\u2019t make it any better I realize and conclude that his\
  \ answer \u201EIt\u2019s okay, it\u2019s okay\u201C just covers his incomprehension.\n\
  Not all porters are Sherpas.This occupation has spread throughout the many tribes\
  \ of the Himalayans.Once they were the most notorious porters in the highlands who\
  \ became famous for being part of many first ascents.Dorji is a short, stocky fellow\
  \ with a little paunch and totally unsuitable hiking gear.He sweats like a horse,\
  \ just like me, although he doesn\u2019t drink anything while hiking, unlike me.\
  \ \nThere they go, a Sherpa and 2 saxonian lowlanders on their day`s march from\
  \ Chokang Paro to Mu Gompa, a lonesome monastery at the end of the valley.Back then\
  \ it was unsure if it was even possible to enter.Rumors were spread that a huge\
  \ landslide brought down the main track.The remote Tsum Valley branches off the\
  \ well-developed Manaslu Circuit.In Lokpa, the first village, we receive our permits.Dorji\
  \ struggles to communicate with the locals since he\u2019s from the Everest region\
  \ and speaks besides Nepali only his mother tongue Sherpa and a little English but\
  \ no Tibetan.Soon the path reaches the riverbed and reveals a rough-and-ready bridge\
  \ made of sticks and branches.A few porters walk ahead and we follow their lead.Mules\
  \ are left behind.\nThe 2015 earthquake hit this region really hard, so it was difficult\
  \ to acquire up-to-date information.More than 1,5 years later, the rebuilding of\
  \ the villages east of the river is far from being finished. Families live in stables,\
  \ men fix dressers, doors and ladders with improvised tools.Nevertheless, we experience\
  \ a warm welcome.We nourish on instant soups, which Dorji magically conjures.The\
  \ Buddhist families share their fireplace with us. \nThe day\u2019s final march\
  \ turns out to be twice as long as planned.It was simply impossible to find shelter.There\
  \ was no fresh food supply over the last days, since the landslide cut off the valley\u2019\
  s trade route.We also ran out of drinking water.Dorji\u2019s first estimated 4 hours\
  \ extended to a 6 hour trip and 2 more to come.I am running on fumes.The next morning\
  \ a 30min authentic spitting and coughing performance drives us out of bed.It\u2019\
  s Lars turn to loose it and I am the optimistic role model."
