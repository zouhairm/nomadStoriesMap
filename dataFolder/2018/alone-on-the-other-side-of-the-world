Text: "Making a local connection can be one of the most amazing events in a person's\
  \ life. I was asked during the senior year of my undergraduate program if I had\
  \ ever thought about teaching English as a second language, specifically, in Thailand.\
  \ Little did I know how much this decision would impact my life and making a local\
  \ connection was crucial to the adventure. I had absolutely no teaching experience\
  \ and even less Thai language experience. A few Skype messages with my singular\
  \ contact there, and with the head of the English language department of the school\
  \ where he taught, preceded my trip to Thailand. I knew nothing about Thailand save\
  \ what I had seen in movies up to that point. I am a student of History currently\
  \ working on my graduate degree, but studying History in the United States primarily\
  \ revolves around Western Civilization. \n\nUpon arrival in Thailand, everything\
  \ happened so quickly. I arrived on a Thursday evening and made my first local connection\
  \ face to face on the ground floor of Bangkok Airport. I saw my name on his sign\
  \ and, knowing I had no return ticket, this was my place for an undetermined amount\
  \ of time. The drive north was approximately eight hours and involved quite a bit\
  \ of napping on my part. The following morning I had an interview with the president\
  \ of the school. She checked my documents: undergraduate certificate, passport,\
  \ etc. It was a Friday morning. I met some faculty and visited some classes with\
  \ some of my future students. Certainly this was not the typical travel experience,\
  \ but I was quickly notified that I had a job and would start work on Monday morning.\
  \ That Friday night was my introduction to the rural Thai lifestyle that would impact\
  \ my life in so many different ways.\n\nMy main learning point is that one must\
  \ go and engage the public. Thai people are incredibly social. Thailand is not known\
  \ as 'the land of smiles'  without good reason. If you go out on the town alone,\
  \ you will be invited to a table by someone. I was lucky enough to have made a contact\
  \ before arrival and my friend introduced me to a local village that currently maintains\
  \ some of my amazing Thai friends this very day. They regularly tell me on Facebook\
  \ how much they miss me, and I miss them terribly. Unfortunate circumstances brought\
  \ me back to the United States and I have missed my Thai family ever since. I lived\
  \ in a rural rice farming community. I stayed positive. One never knows who they\
  \ might encounter. Travel. Explore. Make a local connection."
