Text: "The first time I visited Santo Tom\xE9, province of Corrientes in Argentina,\
  \ it was not with a purpose of knowing tourist attractions of the place. I had just\
  \ won a national prize for young journalists from Brazil, for this reason I had\
  \ a mission: create a report about the risc of Zika virus for Brazilian and Argentine\
  \ women. For this, I needed to go deeply into the lives of the residentes of Santo\
  \ Tom\xE9, learn about their customs, habits, how theys looked after their health\
  \ and their homes. What I did not know is that I would know that place in a diferente\
  \ way. \n    As journalists we learn that we need to see the world with more attentive\
  \ eyes, observe details, detect emotions and from this write so that other people\
  \ feel what we feel. In Santo Tom\xE9 I learned that to observe was as important\
  \ as to speak in journalism, after all, my Spanish it was not my best talent. In\
  \ a mixture of portuguese and Spanish the communication was effective. One of the\
  \ first people I met in the province was a gentleman named Os\xF3rio. \n   - Would\
  \ you answer some questions for a story? \u2013 I ask when I get to the door of\
  \ his house. For my surprise immediately he invites me to enter. Hospitallers and\
  \ friendly, I would define the residents of Santo Tom\xE9. Just like Os\xF3rio most\
  \ people were willing to talk and for me this is a differential in a place. Connecting\
  \ with the people who live there makes the experience much more attractive. \n \
  \  Separated from Brazil by a river called Uruguay, Santo Tom\xE9 is small. 709\
  \ km away from Buenos Aires, the province may not offer everything the capital offers\
  \ like big streets, countless squares, several shops and cafes, but if you are looking\
  \ for calm, the place is the right option. Walking through the streets of Santo\
  \ Tom\xE9, voices speaking in portuguese are very common, the province has a medical\
  \ course at the H.A. Barcel\xF3 Foundation frequented by Brazilians and Argentines.\
  \ \n    Today, I live in S\xE3o Borja \u2013 Brazil, city bordering Santo Tom\xE9\
  . Until I visited Santo Tom\xE9 I did not believe that I had a connection with Argentina\
  \ or that one day I would look for stories in that place. Today I see things differently.\
  \ I am connected to Argentina. Sometimes this connection appears while I think about\
  \ the Argentina ice cream (helado). Or about the narrow streets and trees with pink\
  \ flowers in the spring. Or even about Os\xF3rio, who invited me to his house without\
  \ hesitation. Hospitality and sympathy, we need this. Even if it is in a small and\
  \ distant province."
