Text: "It was the twelfth of October, and we were in the car heading towards Aragon.\
  \ My aunt, having grown up in Spain, had told us how there was a nice parade for\
  \ the celebration of the Virgen del Pilar. People would travel all the way to the\
  \ city of Zaragoza from neighbouring towns to leave flowers to the Virgin Mary as\
  \ an offering, making a huge pile in the central square. It seemed like a nice next\
  \ stop after the fast rhythm of Barcelona; a local festivity.\n    As we had no\
  \ idea where we were heading, we followed the instructions which GPS gave us: \u201C\
  ... turn left ... now turn right ... keep right ...\u201D. The Spanish northern\
  \ road took us through the Ebro valley from Catalonia to Aragon. Autumn had already\
  \ set in the Aragonese landscape, giving the land yellow and orange tones. Everyone\u2019\
  s eyes were lost in the distance, staring at the Christian and Moorish forts and\
  \ towers at each side of the road; with them staring back at us from the distant\
  \ mountains.\n    \u201CYou have arrived\u201D the monotone voice of the GPS notified\
  \ cheerfully. It was already afternoon and the parade was due to start soon. We\
  \ could see people walking along in the same direction so we decided to follow them\
  \ with the car, asking for directions; \u201CDisculpe, \xBFde pura casualidad no\
  \ sabe por d\xF3nde es la celebraci\xF3n?\u201D, \u201CS\xED s\xED, seguid por aqu\xED\
  , doblen all\xE1 y llegar\xE9is\u201D So we drove on until we found an underground\
  \ parking space that seemed closeby enough and went in, parking in what seemed to\
  \ be the last space left. As I walked up the stairs, I was wondering how close we\
  \ were to the event. A second later it was clear.\n    I stood speechless, looking\
  \ at a colossal mountain of colours with a golden figure at the top. Across the\
  \ street, people were still arriving to put more flowers at the base of the massive\
  \ pyramid that had at its top the Virgin. My family and I crossed the street to\
  \ get a better look at what was happening. We got close to a path left open by the\
  \ organisers that lead to a stage which was laid out in front of the Virgin. We\
  \ stood in awe of the size of the event, unrecognisable from the description my\
  \ aunt had given us. After some time, music started and people came pouring through\
  \ the path in front of the stage. Performers danced the jotas, in choreographed\
  \ fights with sticks and daggers, the clanging in rhythm with the music, while children\
  \ in traditional dresses threw petals, creating a trail of colours that gave the\
  \ scene the air of an impressionist painting with the sun setting on the horizon."
