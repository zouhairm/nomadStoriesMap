Text: "\u201CAnd no clicking photos during our 4-hour walk\u201D, said our guide before\
  \ stepping out. I groaned. Coming from a generation of \u2018If it isn\u2019t on\
  \ Instagram, it hasn\u2019t really happened\u2019, this was already a minus. We\
  \ followed the guide, stepped out of the air-conditioned caf\xE9, only to get blasted\
  \ by a gust of hot, summer wind. \nHalf a mile of trek later, we are staring into\
  \ a labyrinth. \u201CWelcome to Dharavi, World\u2019s 3rd Largest Slum\u201D our\
  \ guide shouts over the incessant din from inside. \u201CSpanning only 0.81 sq.\
  \ miles, Dharavi houses more than a million people. Ironic that one of the largest\
  \ slums in the world sits smack in the heart of one of the richest cities in India,\
  \ Mumbai\u201D, he says and walks inside.\nWe walk in too. Sunlight doesn\u2019\
  t permeate in some areas, and in other areas, there is no pathway. Even where there\
  \ are pathways, they are too narrow, so much so that even I had to walk sideways\
  \ to avoid getting stuck between the houses that flank the pathways on both sides\
  \ (I\u2019m a 5 ft, size 4 girl). The houses are 300 sq. ft., inhabited by an average\
  \ of 15 humans and an uncounted number of mice. Most of the houses do not have a\
  \ door \u2013 doors decrease the already meager floor space. Your curiosity of the\
  \ inhabitants is mirrored in their curiosity of yours.\nI peek into a house and\
  \ see a woman cooking. \u201CThe government has built low-cost shelters. Why not\
  \ live in a cleaner place?\u201D I blurted, unable to contain myself.\nRegarding\
  \ me with a smile, she said \u201CNo. We have everything we need \u2013 a roof on\
  \ our heads, schools, friends, and shops. Did you know the even though this is a\
  \ slum, it is self-sufficient?\u201D\nI gaped at her. The tour guide added \u201C\
  She is right. It is a billion-dollar industry. But the profits are shared amongst\
  \ a million. And those 1000 dollars, usually, feed a family of 10.\u201D\nThe woman\
  \ smiled. \u201CI am happy though, really\u201D she said. And yes, she did look\
  \ happy.\nGiven the conditions that the people were staying in, happiness was the\
  \ last thing I expected. The pervasive joyfulness in Dharavi dwellers surprised\
  \ me. Children ran without a care in the world and adults huddled over a shared\
  \ newspaper as if that was the only thing worth doing, at that moment. \nI realized\
  \ that, probably, happiness comes from the feeling of community, something that\
  \ we seemed to have traded for air-conditioned isolation, nuclear families, 8 AM\
  \ to 8 PM jobs and money. And it seems, we do not need as much to be happy as we\
  \ think we do."
