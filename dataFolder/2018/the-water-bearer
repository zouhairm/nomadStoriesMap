Text: "We were stopped at an invariable point on the road, in the immense belly of\
  \ the Atacama Desert. The landscape a broad camel\u2019s back, humped at the hills\
  \ far from the asphalt. We walked through the grave site of an abandoned nitrate\
  \ mine, one of many lost out there, and found amid rudimentary crucifixes a shallow\
  \ grave. Protruded bones were marked with a timber cross painted yellow, no doubt\
  \ by his wife, now forgotten. \n\nConfronted, I stood in the middle of the road.\
  \ We hadn\u2019t seen another vehicle for hours. The white lines along black gravel\
  \ were all that split the desert into a navigable zone. The land was a brown void\
  \ of moisture, the sky a blue void of white cloud. I looked up. \n\nIt was my birthday,\
  \ a day that fell within the constellation of Aquarius. The Water Bearer, I knew\
  \ as a symbolic figure tipping its urn, pouring water down from the cosmos. The\
  \ Atacama was one of the clearest places on earth to see the stars. Two points of\
  \ my zodiac were named, thought to mean \u2018luckiest of the lucky.\u2019 Maybe\
  \ out there that night I would see them. I pushed down on my hat, reassuring my\
  \ head the sun wouldn\u2019t penetrate. Droplets ran from my forearms, returning\
  \ salt to the plains. I turned one full circle. Parts of the Atacama haven\u2019\
  t seen rain in four hundred years. I adored desert places. I had flown across the\
  \ Pacific to see one landmark among the expanse, Valle De La Luna, with its Mars-esque\
  \ terrain, set aflame under resting sun.\n\nDriving on along the highway, our headphones\
  \ in, Javi the local guide paced the aisle, incomprehension on her face. \n\"Why\
  \ are you nod looging oud de windows? Id\u2019s raining! I caan\u2019believe\u2019\
  id! Can\u2019d you see de flowers!\" \nCracked earth sprouted purple flora, odd,\
  \ picaresque, out of place. \n\nAs we drove on the scatter of rain increased. By\
  \ the entrance to Valle De La Luna the umbrellas were out. We were denied entrance\
  \ due to flooding. The disappointment sank like a boulder. We drove on, and I looked\
  \ out the window at a grey sky. We wouldn\u2019t see any stars that night. The last\
  \ thing I expected.\n\nLaguna Cejar, our final stop, was a salt heavy oasis not\
  \ unlike the Dead Sea. We floated in its icy bowl cut through salt crust, laughing\
  \ at the utter rarity of the moment. We were told to leave quickly, the storm getting\
  \ closer. Vivid forks of lightning were moving toward us, the only points higher\
  \ than the expanse of desert floor. I raised my bucket of water, and tipped the\
  \ urn. I felt the dry salt wash away, watching clouds strike, purple flowers sizzle,\
  \ feeling luckier than lucky."
