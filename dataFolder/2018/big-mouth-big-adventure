Text: "Ever wondered what it would feel like, free falling 200 meters into a ravine,\
  \ zip lining thought the canopies of a natural forest, or diving the ocean in search\
  \ of a Great White?  Some of us like to talk big \u2013 but do you have what it\
  \ takes? I recently stopped talking about it and tried it in a destination, rated\
  \ as one of the top for adrenaline junkies and adventure seekers\u2026  destination\
  \ SOUTH AFRICA. From reading numerous blogs, articles on do\u2019s and don\u2019\
  ts to just applying some common sense, I embarked on a journey seeking BIG ADVENTURE.\
  \ Having told many of my friends that fear was not an option, I decided to take\
  \ on three of the most daunting experiences on the \u201CSouth African Adventure\
  \ Menu\u201D First Stop: Tsitsikamma Canopy Tours, Garden Route - if you ever had\
  \ a dream of whizzing through the forest, look no further than this adrenaline rush.\
  \  \u201CFlying\u201D from tree to tree like Tarzan evokes a primal instinct of\
  \ pleasure whilst you triumph over your fear of heights. Then onto Storms River\
  \ - Bloukrans Bridge where the \u201Cmother of all bungee jumps await.  Claimed\
  \ to be the worlds highest commercial jump from a bridge, this 216-meter monster\
  \ will immortalise you among your friends when it comes to bravery vs. stupidity.\
  \  But, then again, I am not here to talk, I am here to do! Having completed a safety\
  \ briefing, as standard with all activities, I cannot wonder whether this was more\
  \ than what I bargained for. I have always had the notion that \u201Cbungee is for\
  \ people who are undecided about suicide\u201D.  Final Stop. Diving with Death.\
  \ Having grown up with JAWS as a reference to sharks has captivated my imagination.\
  \ The sheer magnitude of these creatures cannot be underestimated.  Facing icy cold\
  \ waters, a swell of way over 3 meters and the stench of the Cape Fur seal colony,\
  \ a local delicacy for the sharks, I submerge myself into the steel cage with wide\
  \ eyes as I search for the shadow of one of the most feared apex predators of the\
  \ ocean.  and here it comes. The brute force of the shark brushing with the cage\
  \ sends chills up my spine in these icy waters and I wait for the return for a close\
  \ encounter that surpasses anything that I have experienced to date.  My appetite\
  \ for Adventure is growing and I cannot wait for the next ride.   South Africa,\
  \ you fueled my adventure addiction and you made me proud to visit your shores."
