Text: "I took a step back from the edge, cautiously weighing my steps, aware that\
  \ beyond was a sheer drop off 100 feet into the Ionian Sea. I took a deep, cautious\
  \ breath and gazed out over the water, glimpsing the mountainous terrain of Corfu,\
  \ Greece towering above the water. Two weeks ago, I wasn\u2019t even aware Corfu\
  \ existed. \nWe traveled to the remote island by kayak, a multi-mile journey that\
  \ was strenuous against the current. As we approached the island, our guide led\
  \ us to a ruinous, antiquated dock. The hike to the top of the island was challenging;\
  \ scrambling was required in many spots. Slightly ahead of the group, I was pulled\
  \ as if by gravity to the compelling view at the cliff edge.\nI walked away from\
  \ the edge and rejoined the group, who were huddled around an old church, barren\
  \ besides a worn, brass bell hung above the entrance with a rope trailing to the\
  \ dirt below.\nOur guide was weaving a story of the island, conjuring the dilapidated\
  \ church and the entire community to life. A monastery, now abandoned, was inhabited\
  \ on the craggy island by monks for centuries. Visitors, although infrequent, would\
  \ make a wish at the bell after prayer.\nOur guide grabbed the rope with care, as\
  \ if it was a fragile piece of glassware. She swung it so that the clapper sounded\
  \ the bell with one, resounding ding.\n\u201COne ring for money. I could use some\
  \ more money.\u201D Our guide said slyly, which was greeted with a collective snicker.\
  \ \u201CTwo for happiness, three for love, four for immortality, five for power,\
  \ and six for good loving, if you know what I mean.\u201D The group chuckled appreciatively.\n\
  Once we had cast our wishes at the bell, we descended to the dock and launched off\
  \ in our kayaks. Our next destination was a rock off the coast that offered a 35\
  \ foot leap of faith into the sea. Once we secured our kayaks, we swam to the rock\
  \ and began climbing. The rock was jagged and unforgiving; by the time I reached\
  \ the top, I had a plethora of scratches and my feet were bleeding.\nStanding on\
  \ the edge, I was filled with trepidation. My childhood fear of heights never left\
  \ me completely; I had been fighting it for years. The jump appeared much higher\
  \ from the top than I had anticipated. The overhang was slight and required a lateral\
  \ leap to avoid landing on the base. My palms began sweating. Two more people were\
  \ ahead of me, and already my heart was racing. Before I jumped, someone asked,\
  \ \u201CWhat did you wish for?\u201D\nI wished for love.\nI leapt from the rock,\
  \ and in that moment, I felt free."
