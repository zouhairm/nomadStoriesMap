Text: "I went to La Boca twice a week for 5 years, as a tour guide. It was the most\
  \ popular tour, by far. Located on the banks of the River, Boca was the port, welcome\
  \ and home of thousands of immigrants who, in the mid-nineteenth century, decided\
  \ to make South America their new home. I read they built their houses with corrugated\
  \ sheet metal, an easy-to-move material in case the river water rose. Also, they\
  \ painted the metal constantly to protect it from the recurrent flooding.  Using\
  \ leftover paint from the ships at the port, they accidentally transformed La Boca\
  \ into the now well-known multi-colored neighborhood. \nSometimes, tourists would\
  \ complain that the place was too touristy, not the \u201Creal Buenos Aires\u201D\
  . And I get it, what is genuinely Argentinian about a place where all languages\
  \ except Spanish are heard? Well, to begin with, 150 years ago they didn\u2019t\
  \ speak Spanish either! They tried to communicate in a varied mix of Italian, Spanish,\
  \ German, French. \nAs well, it was the first glimpse of Argentina the immigrants\
  \ saw, and it is the first thing tourists want to see. \nA century and a half ago,\
  \ music brought people together in the streets of La Boca, creating one of the most\
  \ eclectic musical rhythms in the world: tango. Today, it unites tourists mesmerized\
  \ by tango dancers on that same street.\n For neighbors, it was as well, the place\
  \ where they worked, either in the port or nearby factories. But in the 50\u2019\
  s, the port was moved and the factories closed (pollution maybe being the main reason,\
  \ still today the river is known for its high levels of contamination). Just like\
  \ that, La Boca lost its workplace, its colors and its wealth. \nDecades passed,\
  \ marked with poverty and unemployment, until an artist from the area named Quinquela\
  \ Martin decided to give back to the neighborhood and built the outdoor museum known\
  \ as Caminito. The goal weren\u2019t the photos, nor the scenery. It was to proudly\
  \ share the beauty of La Boca and to provide people from the area with a job. Now\
  \ Caminito is one of the main sources of income in Boca. Most people that work there\
  \ are from the area, and proudly protect and embrace the industry. \nIt was an interesting\
  \ experience to be the connection between these two worlds, to explain to a Japanese\
  \ man why it isn\u2019t safe to walk more than a few blocks, to take a picture of\
  \ an Englishman hugging the Maradona look-alike, or to watch an uncomfortable Canadian\
  \ trying to reproduce a sexy tango pose. And I wondered, isn\u2019t this as real\
  \ as it gets?"
