Text: "I closed my eyes to focus just on the soft drizzle running from a tall sprinkler\
  \ placed in the middle of Ljubljana's main square. It was mid August and I decided\
  \ I was going to join the children playing under the fresh water; me too I was looking\
  \ to cool off, me too I was looking to have some fun. \n\nA young man sitting in\
  \ one of the corners of the square was creating the soundtrack of this very moment\
  \ with his odd, beautifully-sounding instrument. The fast paced rhythm made my feet\
  \ move to the beat in the puddle created from the above water; I looked down to\
  \ my feet and saw they were now soaking wet. I was then a newly graduate and these\
  \ were my last days traveling before starting my new supposedly grown-up life, so\
  \ not even wet shoes couldn't ruin this moment.  \n\nWith the ephemeral company\
  \ of an ice-cream, I strolled along Jo\u017Ee Ple\u010Dnik's Triple Bridge across\
  \ the Ljubljanica river to time travel from the modern city to the medieval one,\
  \ with each step feeling the architect's love for the city. Surrounded by dragons,\
  \ on the vigilant eye of the hilltop castle, I could not know whether I was in a\
  \ beautiful capital of Eastern Europe or on the Game of Thrones set.\n\nA local\
  \ recommended me to visit the National and University Library of Slovenia, the architect's\
  \ masterpiece \"It is an impressive building with a history and meaning up to its\
  \ beauty\" she told me. So, here I was, in front of a massive construction, and\
  \ with my hand on the winged Pegasus door handle I opened to door to what it was\
  \ the house of knowledge. From the vestibule I got in front of a monumental, dark\
  \ marble staircase which led up to a dazzling reading room. From darkness to light,\
  \ from struggle to success; a metaphor of the student's journey, was what Jo\u017E\
  e Ple\u010Dnik's intended to build, a metaphor of life itself, I thought.  \n\n\
  I decided to rest on one of the staircase's step and I could not avoid thinking\
  \ whether I had already arrived at that illuminated part or not; I learned a lot,\
  \ both from the academic world and the living-on-my-own-for-the-first-time world\
  \ but honestly I felt like I was still climbing the stairs and light was nowhere\
  \ to be seen. I had bigger, scarier doubts than when I first started university\
  \ and now was time to go back and search for the light."
