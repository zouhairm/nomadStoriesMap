Text: "There I was, in a new city. Alone. No one to help me make the decisions that\
  \ could quite possibly make this one of the best expierciences of my life. The rain\
  \ had just let up as I was checking into my hotel. I felt stale from hours on a\
  \ plane yet all I wanted to do was explore this beautiful country. So, throwing\
  \ caution to the wind, I decided to venture out into the unknown. \nThe smell of\
  \ the rain on the pavement and the freshly mowed lawns of the townsfolk awoke my\
  \ senses in a way I forgot was possible. There were raindrops clinging to every\
  \ surface giving them new dimensions as the sunlight hit them. People walk past\
  \ laughing and happy for a break from the clouds. But I moved away from the crowds\
  \ of downtown just to walk. I ventured out towards the outskirts of town, up steep\
  \ hills and into beautiful neighborhoods filled with fine houses and perfectly groomed\
  \ hedges. \nAlmost assuredly I found the most wonderous view of the city. So I sat,\
  \ my back to the magnificent houses, watching the city below me. It wasn\u2019t\
  \ a glamorous picture to behold. For that view showed the poverty so stark in comparison\
  \ to the lavish houses I had just passed. Fences stood broken and in need of repairs,\
  \ lawns overgrown collecting unwanted children\u2019s toys. \nYet everywhere I looked\
  \ were smiling faces. There were no upturned noses at those less fortunate, just\
  \ kindness and happiness. I could tell that the people in this country that I had\
  \ the pleasure of viewing were fantastic people and that they were pure. Those are\
  \ the people that would bring me back to this very spot time and time again. \n\
  In the face of others people tend to put a hacade over their true characters. The\
  \ fact that everyone I saw was so joyous and open without knowing they were being\
  \ viewed told me everything I ever needed to know about the place that I was visiting.\
  \ It told me that I had found a place with a population of amazing people that would\
  \ welcome anyone to their table with open arms. Like your grandmother with a smile\
  \ on their face. If that doesn\u2019t sound like home to you I do believe you should\
  \ visit the city of Drogheda for yourself so you can experience the welcoming feeling\
  \ of the people that live there too."
