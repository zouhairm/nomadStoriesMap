Text: "As soon as we arrived at the hostel, the praises of Gokarna\u2019s not-be-missed\
  \ sunrise started surrounding us. Hushed conversations with locals revealed to us\
  \ one of Gokarna\u2019s best kept secrets - the Paradise beach.  Unwilling to pass\
  \ the opportunity, we decided to rent a few scooties and leave for the beach the\
  \ next night.  With activas trailed behind one another in the town\u2019s wilderness\
  \ where, shockingly, both signs and street lights have been deemed futile, I volunteer\
  \ to ride as a friend hops onto the pillion seat \u2013 both of us geared up for\
  \ the long journey ahead.\n\nExcept that it wasn\u2019t. Three minutes on the road\
  \ and the sound of our scooty skidding down the cliff and banging into the tree\
  \ deluged the midnight air. Moments of numbness were followed by the epiphany of\
  \ escaping death. A few minutes later, crisp autumn leaves crushing under our feet\
  \ voice our attempts to get up. None of our friends seemed to have realised that\
  \ one of the eleven scooties had broken out of the trail, and we decided to keep\
  \ it that way. After allowing ourselves a moment of respite, we head to the beach\
  \ with our now bleeding arms and a half torn jacket. \n\nAs we got on with the journey,\
  \ the night suddenly seemed more illuminated (a result of my suddenly heightened\
  \ senses, I\u2019m guessing). Everything else now felt trivial - the beauty of breaking\
  \ the circle of banality. An hour later, we reached the spot and locked our activa\
  \ only to be welcomed by the long hike that lay ahead. The walk uphill was accompanied\
  \ by casual cautions of wild snakes by our guide that, surprisingly, had little\
  \ effect on us.\n\nWhen we finally reached Paradise beach, worried friends applied\
  \ first aid but I couldn\u2019t stop smiling. The reflection of the strewn stars\
  \ in the glowing river multiplied the sky above me, leaving behind an ambience was\
  \ too calm to indulge in panic. Here I am, with bruised limbs and a jacket that\
  \ does little to comfort my freezing body but boy, the blanket of stars does help.\
  \ I lie down, stretch my legs as my curled toes run through the sand and simply\
  \ stare at the sky. It had been a long night, and a little before the dramatic sunrise\
  \ I longed for occurred - I fell into deep slumber. \n\nI bet the sun must have\
  \ been striking as it gradually embodied itself into the daylight.\nBut when I look\
  \ back, it is the starry night that seduces itself into my memories, every single\
  \ time."
