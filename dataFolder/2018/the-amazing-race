Text: "The last thing I expected was the burst of energy and adrenalin which I felt\
  \ when I ran to the sacred site the Incas called Intipunku (Sun Gate), soon after\
  \ descending from the highest peak of our trek; Kuychicassa at 4,450 metres above\
  \ sea level. \n\nI was with one of my closest friends Daniela walking the Inca Quarry\
  \ Trail in Peru \u2013 what an incredible chapter in my life, what an incredible\
  \ 40th birthday gift I gave to myself. The absolute freedom to be in the mountains\
  \ of Cusco with minimal civilisation, surrounded by mountains big and small, and\
  \ only a glimpse of the locals along the way literally took my breathe away. \n\n\
  After walking as slow as snail the past 48 hours, all seemed to have disappeared\
  \ when Daniela and I finally reached our tour guide after our descent. We asked\
  \ where to from here and she told Daniela and I to head back to the campsite as\
  \ it was too late to get to the Sun Gate. When I asked her if we could go tomorrow\
  \ she informed us we would never again get the chance to see such magnificence.\
  \ We would have to get there in 20 minutes, but she said it was impossible because\
  \ we were still an hour away to the destination. I did not travel 13,000kms to miss\
  \ out on anything on seeing the Sun Gate.  I turned to Daniela and said, \u2018\
  shall we run Dani?\u2019 There was no hesitation in her voice when she said \u2018\
  yep, let\u2019s do it\u2019. So, run we did. \n\nWe had endeavoured minimal oxygen\
  \ to our brains, ascending some scary steep dusty hills which even our hiking shoes\
  \ barely managed to save us from sliding down. We had faced the edge of some tracks\
  \ that if we slipped there was no return. I had literally crawled up and down these\
  \ hills, facing my fear of heights and yet none of this mattered as we ran as fast\
  \ as we could to the Sun Gate. \n\nWhen we past some people from our group we could\
  \ hear them yelling \u2018Go team Sydney!\u2019 We had given them the name Team\
  \ Adelaide along the trek and to hear them give us the same nickname almost felt\
  \ like we were attempting the \u2018amazing race\u2019. So, we ran even faster.\
  \ \n\nStill to this day I don\u2019t know where we got our energy from but when\
  \ I crawled up the hill one final time up to the Sun Gate with seven minutes to\
  \ spare before the sun went down, I knew I had accomplished more than I set out\
  \ to do. \n\nStanding under the arches of the Sun Gate, the sunset had never looked\
  \ more beautiful; it was last thing I expected to see when I began this trek and\
  \ well worth running towards in the final moments of one of our most challenging\
  \ days."
