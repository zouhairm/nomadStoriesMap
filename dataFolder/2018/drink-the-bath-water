Text: "Bath water is warm. Sourced from three hot springs located deep below the earth\u2019\
  s surface, over one million litres of water is delivered daily to the ancient Roman\
  \ baths of Bath, United Kingdom. \n\nMy first and only sip of Bath water was horrid.\
  \ Uncomfortably warm and rich in minerals, it tasted as though I\u2019d been hit\
  \ in the face with a steel frying pan and left to savour the rusty taste of my bloodied\
  \ gums. But, in spite of this, Bath water is something that everyone must try in\
  \ their lifetime.\n\nFor years untold, the Celts used the natural hot springs of\
  \ Bath as a shrine to their nurturing and life-giving deity, Sulis. Plunging themselves\
  \ into the tepid waters, the native population regarded bathing in the springs to\
  \ be a truly spiritual experience. \n\nThen came the spread of the Roman Empire\
  \ in Britain. No doubt hearing of the alluring springs in Bath, or Aquae Sulis as\
  \ they called it, the Romans travelled to the town in 60-70 AD. Soon believing the\
  \ waters to have healing and spiritual properties, they set to constructing their\
  \ own place of worship at the site of the hot springs. \n\nAs history has taught\
  \ us time and again, conflicting ideologies give rise to conflict. In the first\
  \ century \u2013 an era seen as barbaric compared to our highly lawful and civilised\
  \ 21st century lives \u2013 one would assume that this clash of belief systems would\
  \ result in violence. But conceived in this marriage of two opposing cultures came\
  \ instead something wonderful: Sulis Minerva. \n\nA syncretism of ancient Roman\
  \ and Celtic goddesses, Sulis and Minerva, this new divinity united the native and\
  \ Roman peoples to share and drink the Bath waters. And that was the last thing\
  \ I expected. \n\nAs watched my step on the uneven paving stones and gazed around\
  \ the grandeur of the bath house, I superimposed an image. I saw the healthy and\
  \ chronically ill immersing themselves into the sacred depths. Celtic natives cupping\
  \ their hands to \u2018take\u2019 the water. Roman upper-class and slaves sitting\
  \ side by side as equals under an elaborately carved limestone arch. \n\nAnd I reflected.\
  \ I reflected upon the terrorism and racism conceived due to ideological differences\
  \ in current day United Kingdom: the islamophobia and xenophobia; the terror attacks\
  \ that so often occupy our news headlines. And I wondered. If our ancestors could\
  \ assimilate their two seemingly incongruous religions to share in the beauty of\
  \ our world, why can\u2019t we? \n\nIsn\u2019t it time we all took a drink of the\
  \ Bath water?"
