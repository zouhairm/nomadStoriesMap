Text: "I was going to take that bus or yes or yes. I had to arrive in Tangier in time\
  \ to meet Anna the following day. It was about 9 am and I just wanted to leave the\
  \ leaden Nador sky behind. The atmosphere was heavy. I had spotted some zombie people\
  \ railing against each other by crushing a glass bottle on the street not far from\
  \ me. Was that irruption of violence due to poverty or to the thirst and hanger\
  \ of the Ramadan period?  \nWho knows how much time would have cost me to reach\
  \ the bus station without the prompt intervention of that young Marroquin man, who\
  \ I had just met in the plane. He had told me about the accident. The fire fused\
  \ some of his fingers together and his face partially looked like melted wax. The\
  \ monstrous morphology of his aspect clashed with the beauty of his gentle manners.\
  \ Thanks to him I was soon able to ask to the bus driver:\u201Chow long will arriving\
  \ in Tangier take?\u201D\u201COh, a couple of hours!\u201D  \nAfter 9 hours of bus\
  \ ride, the driver stopped the bus and invited us to leave the vehicle. That could\
  \ not be Tangier\u2026  My new Marroquin travelling friend prompted me to follow\
  \ the crowd that was moving behind the building facing the sunset. Throughout that\u201C\
  two-hour trip\u201DI had the opportunity to languish in my thoughts while new horizons\
  \ and ways of living fed my archive of imaginaries. We crossed the Rif Mountains,\
  \ which belong stretch along the northern Moroccan cost.  \nThe bus went up and\
  \ down turning streets, slowly but constantly. It stopped many times, in improbable\
  \ muddy villages made of arranged houses and recycled materials. Few people entering\
  \ and exiting the vehicle at every stop. I was looking out of the window at the\
  \ women in their black hijab conducting their daily routine. Suddently, the bus\
  \ turned and the landscape revealed wild marijuana plantations covering the mountainsides\
  \ as far as the eye could see. I was astonished by what in the word exists.  \n\
  When the bus made that unexpected stop at sunset, I was invited to join the all\
  \ they long craved Eftar, breakfast. The deep and ancient singing of the Monshed,\
  \ the Azan, was inaugurating that moment of peacful reconciliation. Asking nothing\
  \ in return, with spontaneity and simplicity, they served me a warm bowl of fuming\
  \ food. I sat next to my friend, who told me that soon we would arrive in Tangier.\
  \ I thought that Marroquin people were just really civilized. My new friend told\
  \ me I could sleep at his place that night. I trusted him."
