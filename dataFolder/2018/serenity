Text: "I have always been curious of the world. Specifically, I have always been interested\
  \ in people. What makes us who we are? What makes us different? Why do we value\
  \ certain things? It is because of this, that I have always been interested in different\
  \ cultures, religions, and diversity of what different regions of the world have\
  \ to offered. \n\nFor those who have travelled to Thailand, they have always left\
  \ with a desire to return one day. I wasn't sure why this was the case, until I\
  \ went to see it on my own. In 2017, I spent my birthday in Thailand. I didn't just\
  \ go to Thailand though, but rather in a town that was north and close to the border\
  \ of Myanmar. The town was Pai, and I wanted to go there because I have heard about\
  \ how mythical their local canyon was. So on my birthday, I decided to get there\
  \ in the way that I appreciate seeing the world best; by running! It was early dawn\
  \ when I left from my hostel. I mildly recall a party from the night before, and\
  \ as a result, nobody was around upon my departure. Well, that's not completely\
  \ true; one person endured the run to catch the sunrise with me. It was another\
  \ local traveller who happened to be from the same city and country that I was from!\
  \ Small world, eh? I recall telling her that I was planning on doing this the day\
  \ before, and to my surprise, she met me at her hostel bright eyed and bushy tailed.\
  \ At 5:30AM, the heat and humidity of Thailand had no intentions of easing up...\
  \ but I am glad we made that run. Upon arrival, we noticed that there were no other\
  \ fellow travellers there; just 2 Canadians to appreciate the humbling sun as it\
  \ greeted us atop of the canyon. Words cannot come close to describe the feeling\
  \ of ecstasy as we saw it for ourselves. From that day forward, I vouched to travel\
  \ and spend my birthday in a new country every year, and specifically to appreciate\
  \ the delicacy of mother nature. If you get a chance to read this, I highly recommend\
  \ Pai canyon. But don't stop there; our world has so many things to offer."
