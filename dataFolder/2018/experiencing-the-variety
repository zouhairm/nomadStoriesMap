Text: "\u201CPigeons, they're giant! Look at them!\u201D I couldn\u2019t stop taking\
  \ pictures of strange birds, wishing to send them to my best friend who hates pigeons\
  \ for no reason.\nEverything in that place looked amusing and incredible, starting\
  \ from poor pigeons to little cute houses at the shore of the Atlantic Ocean. The\
  \ phrase \u201CC\u2019est magnifique!\u201D came to my mind again and again. \n\
  I remember myself reading one book about France. Regardless of the fact that I fell\
  \ asleep while reading only the introduction, I was annoyed with the author\u2019\
  s habit to repeat the same idea in every paragraph that France is varied and its'\
  \ every place is unique and it doesn\u2019t look like anything you've seen in your\
  \ life. Even though I didn\u2019t want to hear that any longer, I found it intriguing\
  \ and saved it somewhere in the corner of my memory.\nSo here was I, in Les Sables-d'Olonne,\
  \ glad that I took my camera with an empty memory card, ready to take a picture\
  \ of every single moment. Posting some shots on social media, I would immediately\
  \ receive lots of comments, complementing landscapes, bright colours and indescribable\
  \ atmosphere, even if you\u2019d take a picture with closed eyes and shaking hands,\
  \ it would become incroyable, as French people say. Those colours! Being born in\
  \ a small town where the main shade of the sky and people\u2019s faces was grey,\
  \ I could appreciate the variety of the colours and I was always astonished by them\
  \ like a child.\nAlso, in such place, you must trust people as everyone could see\
  \ what\u2019s going on in your garden and passers-by could notice, by accident of\
  \ course, what channel you watched that Tuesday evening. If you're a greedy person\
  \ and, moreover, you are fond of seafood, then welcome to Les Sables! Once you try\
  \ the little ocean treasures, you won\u2019t be able to eat them in any other place\
  \ and nobody will blame you for that, since it's one of the main specialties of\
  \ the city. Strong winds and soft beaches, night fishermen and daily tourists, mysterious\
  \ swamps and clear sky, and all contradictory details which make your heart want\
  \ to come back.\nMostly people don\u2019t like to admit that they were wrong but\
  \ it wasn\u2019t the case for me that time. I joyfully agreed with the idea of how\
  \ varied and unique every place in France was. I haven\u2019t seen a lot yet but\
  \ I believe that it\u2019s more than enough for me to be able to judge.  Despite\
  \ of all the various moments of France, there are things, remaining the same: tasty\
  \ bread, smiling people, charming French and couples that are holding hands."
