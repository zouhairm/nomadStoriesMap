Text: "Last year was extremely hard for me. Applying to university and starting new\
  \ adult life was hard for me. All my imagination and expectation crashed but now\
  \ I understood that all of that made me stronger and a hard worker. I go out of\
  \ my comfort zone and find that I am able to do everything if I will try or at least\
  \ will get priceless experience that shapes my personality and make me batter. I\
  \ love to travel and concerning it I also want to go out of the comfort zone. I\
  \ traveled only within my little country, Kyrgyzstan. I have never traveled far\
  \ away from it and therefore I decided to apply to this program. Before I afraid\
  \ of traveling because the way luggage seemed to be tormented but now I find that\
  \ the main thing is whom you meet, where you were and what you see are the most\
  \ memorable thing. If in life nothing to remember the life was in vain within the\
  \ comfort zone. \nI changed my life now I try to get more work and more responsibilities\
  \ than in past. My last life was so calm that it made me angry. In such life, I\
  \ felt no development no discovery. It pushed me to change it. Now my purpose is\
  \ to do my best in everything which I do, get maximum of it and by this way get\
  \ maximum from life. If before I thought that taking a good job will contribute\
  \ me a good life, now I set a goal to fill my life with memories, friends, and photos.\
  \ It will be a good life for me if I could get maximum of fun from it and see many\
  \ interesting in the world. To do this I need to give up old principles. I believe\
  \ that I made a good decision even I give up the comfort.\nThe decision to take\
  \ more work and responsibilities in order to become a hard worker and stronger,\
  \ in reality, is very difficult. This pushed me to the edge but if I give up my\
  \ life will not become easier. I believe that I made the right decision the skills\
  \ and the personality which I will get at the end will help me to become happy.\
  \ Even my happiness seems strange. The point is that my life will not in vain."
