Text: "Everything starts one day, when my parents gave me the fantastic news of their\
  \ decision to make a family trip. I will introduce myself: I am 25 years old, studied\
  \ an English philology degree, I do work hard, but nowadays nothing makes me rich,\
  \ and my PASSION in life is travelling. But not travelling when I do have some free\
  \ days at work, I have the need of making my life just for travelling. \nSo, when\
  \ my parents gave me the big news of a (free) travel, you may imagine how my happiness\
  \ was increased. The destination was the Caribbean Sea. I can still remember, like\
  \ it was yesterday, the moment we get into the beach, swimming from the boat to\
  \ the seashore through that totally clear blue water, and I tread the soft white\
  \ sand. On that moment, Erick our 19-year-old guide told me if I wanted to see something\
  \ I would love. Well, adults were taking a beer in the beach bar but, a local offering\
  \ to show me something new? This beats even the coldest beer. Erick was a local\
  \ guy from the isle which works hard taking advantage of greedy Caribbean tourism\
  \ to make money for his poor family. His biggest dream was playing football and\
  \ becoming a professional. I can\xB4t express the feeling when a local guy with\
  \ such a different culture opens his heart in that way and tell you such personal\
  \ things. It makes you feel close to humanity. Arriving to Maho beach through motorboat\
  \ was impossible because of the danger of the planes landing so close. People on\
  \ the boat desist the idea, we only had 50 minutes untill our cruise boat leave\
  \ the island, and we still need to arrive to the boat port. Not me. Erick advised\
  \ me to swim until I reach the sand. Shark waters surround the place where we were,\
  \ but he will be coming with me. We both jump into the water and swim 20 minutes\
  \ until reaching the sand. I do feel safe with him. Thanks to this courage act from\
  \ Erick, I lived one of the most beautiful experiences in life. While we were swimming,\
  \ two different planes landed in the airport. Planes pass completely near from the\
  \ water, and watching this is a feeling I would never be able to explain. Do you\
  \ ever recognized a complete happiness feeling occupying every single part of your\
  \ body?  I completely did. We finally reach the sand, and had few minutes to see\
  \ the last plane landing and going back to the boat swimming. No words to explain\
  \ the sense overrunning yourself when you achieve something you\u2019ve been ages\
  \ dreaming of. Laces before swimming so hard where completely worthy!"
