Text: "Trekking Nepal lived up to the hype. Each mountainous bend unfurled to lush\
  \ terraced rice fields, gnarled and foggy thickets and the unbelievable expanse\
  \ of the Himalayas. Yet a less welcome surprise was a reticent guide.\n\nIf actions\
  \ speak louder than words, Shiva was screaming. He maintained distance and shot\
  \ back glances to check if I kept pace. I\u2019d given him no reason to withdraw;\
  \ I didn\u2019t complain when I pattered over landslides or pockmarked bridges jimmied\
  \ over pinballing waves. I was even ahead of schedule.\n\nYet I knew he could be\
  \ friendly. At one point we overtook two young porters saddled with nearly 100 pounds\
  \ of rice. Shiva greeted them warmly\u2013patting one on the back and squeezing\
  \ the other\u2019s neck. His emotional shift left me hurt, and then I supposed Shiva\
  \ didn\u2019t like me just because, a maddening yet unchallengeable excuse.\n\n\
  I took the afternoon as an opportunity to shake the chill in my bones, and hastened\
  \ to the kitchen for tea. Yet before I could fall into melancholy, an unfamiliar\
  \ voice lifted my daze. \u201CDo you want to learn a Nepalese game?\u201D I nodded,\
  \ and he pulled his bench closer.\n\nShiva dealt cards with smooth loops, and simultaneously\
  \ poured glasses of raksi, a fiery grain alcohol. I caught the name of the game,\
  \ Dumbal, but was so stunned he was talking to me that I barely comprehended the\
  \ objective. As I gazed on, Shiva stopped. He smiled, and gently laid his cards\
  \ and hands on the table.\n\nHis words were slow, but with every sip he gained momentum.\
  \ His hands only parted when he flicked his fingers toward the village where he\
  \ grew up, near Everest. Shiva\u2019s parents were avid agriculturalists and devout\
  \ Hindus from the Brahmin caste. Brahmins don\u2019t socialize outside their caste,\
  \ which groomed Shiva to be reserved, something he\u2019s working against.\n\nHis\
  \ confidence grew when he spoke of shedding caste rules and adopting leniency. He\
  \ lifted his glass and pointed it toward me, emphasizing he drank and socialized\
  \ with the non-Brahmin class. Furthermore, he gave his children the choice to practice\
  \ Hinduism, which is rare in Nepal. As the raksi sunk in, the chill in my bones\
  \ warmed to admiration for Shiva\u2019s desire of cultural change. Shiva gingerly\
  \ set his glass on top of the cards, and peered behind to the few lights embedded\
  \ in the mountains.\n\nShiva and I have stayed in touch, and our raksi-laden night\
  \ serves as a reminder that it\u2019s easy to confuse discomfort for dislike. He\
  \ gave me a new friendship and perspective. Also, I still play Dumbal."
