Text: "It was another normal Saturday morning. Fingers splayed over the cushions of\
  \ my bed, my hair danced in the air thanks to my personal AC system \u2013 a pivoting\
  \ pedestal fan. My eyes were closed, diverted, from the computer screen. It was\
  \ still frozen from my latest search for the bus schedule but my left foot was instead\
  \ tapping out my uncertainty. I cracked my eyes open. Squinting. The next bus to\
  \ Liberia left in twenty minutes and I hadn\u2019t packed a single thing. It was\
  \ a now or never moment and I was quickly slipping into the never.  Finally, my\
  \ phone vibrated. \n\nInstantly I shot off my bed, rummaging through the dresser\
  \ to assure I packed enough underwear before I walked out of the house, onto the\
  \ street, and into the cab that thankfully wasted no time speeding me to the bus\
  \ stop. My lack of a one-mil col\xF3n made it imperative for my cabby to strike\
  \ a deal with the bus driver and, before I knew it, I was the last passenger on\
  \ the bus heading to Liberia. Somehow, in a short twenty minutes, I had successfully\
  \ packed and begun my first solo journey on the Costa Rican bus system.\n\nI took\
  \ a bet traveling 5 hours for a less than 24-hour stay in Playa Tamarindo but I\
  \ expected nothing more than one fun night. The plan was to meet up with some friends\
  \ and check out Tamarindo\u2019s Halloweekend nightlife to see what another Montezuma\
  \ beaches had to offer - which turned out to be one memorable night. Together the\
  \ group of us danced on the bar, found ourselves in a local's apartment playing\
  \ games, and making late night craving runs for Trits, an undeniably genius combination\
  \ of cookie and ice cream in a cup. I thought it was a successful 8 hours stay but\
  \ it turns out my weekend would be even longer than I thought. \n\nOn a convincing\
  \ whim, I decided to stay an extra day. I packed away my fears of skipping class\
  \ and unquestionably invested in living life Pura Vida. I not only basked in coconut\
  \ oil on the beach but I found myself walking along the shores in search of a \u201C\
  friend of a friend\u2019s\u201D surgeon role-model who took us to his dream home.\
  \ Befit with a 360 view of Tamarindo, we watched a beautiful Costa Rican sunset\
  \ from the waters of an infinity pool. Shimmering over the ocean, the sky transformed\
  \ from a lurid, light pink into a cascade of dark, warm orange that glowed with\
  \ bold intensity over the Tamarindo beaches. I was incandescently happy. Happy to\
  \ know my love for the color orange was finally validated but also happy for 48,\
  \ short hours of beautiful, unexpected travel."
