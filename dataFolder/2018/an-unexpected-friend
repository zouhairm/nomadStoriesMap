Text: "I\u2019ll never forget that feeling. Anxiety tinged with panic, as I prepared\
  \ to leave all that I knew for nine months travelling alone overseas. Motivated\
  \ by unhappiness, I was to follow the well-trodden path of all those seeking an\
  \ escape from their everyday reality. It should have been exciting but instead it\
  \ was frightening - how could I cope, timid and shy, alone in a foreign country\
  \ where I barely spoke the language? \n\nBut then, something surprising happened.\
  \ On that first morning in Rome I met a stranger, a girl just like me. Only she\
  \ wasn\u2019t like me at all. Fun loving and care free, she lived every moment and\
  \ embraced all that was new, seeing life as an adventure for the taking. She took\
  \ me under her wing and I forgot myself \u2013 forgot to worry, forgot to be scared.\
  \ Suddenly, a foreign land sprang alive and I began to immerse myself in all that\
  \ was strange and new. Together we travelled in search of adventure and for whatever\
  \ may come our way. \n\nFrom Venice to Vernazza, Salerno to Sardinia, Puglia to\
  \ Paris \u2013 we walked and hiked and cycled, breathing it all in and trying to\
  \ forever commit each moment to memory. The sunny days seemed endless and we revelled\
  \ in the pure air and glorious sunsets, the freedom and the joy and the utter simplicity\
  \ of it all. Limoncello in Capri, Mirto in Sardinia, music in St. Mark\u2019s square\
  \ - the nights were long and we made the most of them, wandering, chatting and feeling\
  \ intoxicated by life. Even the simplest things were exciting and memorable, and\
  \ it occurred to me that this was life as I had never known it. Never had it felt\
  \ so wonderful to embrace every moment as it did through these nine months of freedom,\
  \ of exploration, of life. And still I marvelled at my companion. \n\nWho was this\
  \ girl, I wondered \u2013 where was she before I met her? Could I have been this\
  \ girl, had I not succumbed to mental illness and depression? I wondered at my luck\
  \ in meeting her, and at her fearlessness, her engaging nature, her spirit. How\
  \ I wished to be like her! \n\nThe days rolled on \u2013 Le Tour Eiffel at sunset;\
  \ Il Colosseo bathed in moonlight; the golden temples of Paestum and sunrise over\
  \ Capri. I lost my heart in those endless days, to the feelings within me and the\
  \ beauty around me. And one day I just knew. My friend was me \u2013 a \u2018me\u2019\
  \ deeply buried and long since forgotten. For so long trapped in a colourless existence,\
  \ in a prison of my own creation, I had been released by the wonders of this magical\
  \ journey and the freedom of a different life."
