Text: "I recall how time flew. How it can went away , making decisions, earning money,\
  \ chasing dreams that were always at a distance, with ability to aspire but inability\
  \ to reach that distance where dreams become reality. Until it all happened. One\
  \ fine new years eve. I was sitting at home and thinking out loud. Wondering where\
  \ life would take me as another year flew by. Being able to seek my destiny involved\
  \ taking hold of my dream. Night fell upon me and the world outside celebrated the\
  \ start of the new year , i decided to look ahead towards a warmest rising sun-\
  \ seeking the new sunrise.  Planning a new journey. \nI decided to there and then\
  \ give my career a break. Taking a new decision to pursue my dream as a teacher\
  \ , to go on my wanderlust and look beyond where i was that day. I took upon myself\
  \ to apply online for a teaching job somewhere in Northern Thailand.  Chiang Mai.\
  \ The beautiful land of green valleys in far away Thailand.  In less than week,\
  \ i was on my way to Bangkok.  Beyond Pakistan , this was to be a new challenge\
  \ but a beginning of my new dream that would become reality. Where i would do something\
  \ beyond my usual work , beyond banking, beyond sales , beyond the corporate world\
  \ that i decided to get away from - to find a reality within myself. Something i\
  \ would love to do- something i always wanted. \n\nThis was the last thing i expected.\
  \  That i would actually be able to take such a decision on the eve of the new year\
  \ and actually be able to go for it , taking a chance that i normally would shy\
  \ away from. Seeking the comfort zone over the years , I yearned to break the chains\
  \ and the barriers in my mind - to go beyond . Loved every moment of it . The people\
  \ i met , the children i taught , the place i visited the friends i cherished over\
  \ that time would always remind me the the beauty of life is making life worth living\
  \ - meaningful and radiant.  \n\nI was always a good writer . That moment on , i\
  \ decided to pursue my passion to serve the community and work with children and\
  \ to write aBout my experiences , bringing my true writing spirit to life.  I returned\
  \ , happy and contented. Revitalised and Refined as a writer. I got in touch with\
  \ UK online magazine editor and showcased my work and was accepted as a contributing\
  \ team member.  To my surprise , i continue to write for them till today and yes-\
  \ the last thing i expected was that i am still committed each day , a new story\
  \ becomes a new hope.  \n\nA new sunrise."
