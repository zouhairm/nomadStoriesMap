Text: "I had been walking non-stop for 8 hours trying to reach Gorakshep, the last\
  \ village before the harsh nature of the mountain complex of Everest make any human\
  \ settlement impossible. The monsoon season hid the beauty of those majestic landscapes,\
  \ most of the time. Many areas had collapsed, oxygen was missing, in fact I was\
  \ over 16.500ft, and visibility was very poor. From the haze behind me, I heard\
  \ shouts, caught by the fright, I turned back and saw a young man in his thirties\
  \ wearing slippers and a transport package; Paul. Paul was born and lived in those\
  \ mountains and he knew them like the back of his hand. Behind his fluent English\
  \ there were years of sacrifice and danger for a better future. Every morning from\
  \ the age of 6 he traveled, with other students, 2 hours by foot, to get to the\
  \ nearest school. The trails were dangerous and the weather unpredictable. He confessed\
  \ me that his greatest fear was the flu. I figured myself why; a few days before\
  \ I had met an elderly woman, Binsa \u201Cfearless\u201D, on a stretcher, she had\
  \ been traveling on it for 3 days to get to the nearest hospital. Binsa said , joking,\
  \ \"it's easier for me to die in a ravine than from sickness.\" That was the journey\
  \ necessary for a simple X-Ray. Paul, however, explained there were very few students\
  \ in his village and when there was the flu he almost never got sick. So, he was\
  \ supposed to walk all the way to school alone. He smiled and then exclaimed, opening\
  \ his arms, \u201Cthis is home\u201D. He had a humor that reminded a lot the English\
  \ settlers. I didn\u2019t hesitate to ask him what he was carrying. He laughed out\
  \ loud and told me \"shit\". I stared at him a few seconds trying to figure out\
  \ if it was another of his jokes. He showed me \u201Cthe goods\u201D in the bag\
  \ saying, \"that's our gold\"! At that height no bushes could grow and the only\
  \ fuel source was the yak dung, which was much cheaper than a gas cylinder that\
  \ had to travel on a yak for 7 days. The bag was carried on the back, but with a\
  \ band that was placed on the forehead. In his opinion, it was easier to handle\
  \ and less risky to fall and slide. His eyes were bright; he was having fun telling\
  \ me these stories. I took the chance to carry the \u201CNepalese gold\u201D, but\
  \ my neck couldn\u2019t support the weight. It was not the right time to injure\
  \ myself, despite a nice bamboo stretcher was waiting for me. \nThat hour passed\
  \ quickly and we soon arrived at Gorakshep. It was time to invite him for dinner\
  \ and spend a wonderful evening in a warm place."
