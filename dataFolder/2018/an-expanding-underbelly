Text: "\u201CWhatever you\u2019re thinking, it gets worse.\u201D\n\nSurprising words\
  \ to hear from Manuel while we were overlooking a gorgeous ravine and volcano mere\
  \ meters from San Juan Comalapa\u2019s city center. \n\nAs I gazed at the surreal\
  \ rainforest and delightful hue above, it dawned on me.\n\nA quick glance to my\
  \ left revealed an older man in uniform dumping trash directly into the ravine.\
  \ As I looked over the massive ledge to see where it was landing, I saw a vast sea\
  \ of bottles, cans and various liquids.\n\nAny job in the rural municipality is\
  \ a privilege, given its 14-percent employment rate, but its trash disposal system\
  \ was a harrowing sight. \n\nAlmost entirely indigenous, Comalapa \u2014 like many\
  \ other Guatemalan villages \u2014 has an unsavory history, Manuel explained.\n\n\
  Once a thriving Maya metropolis of commerce and institutional tradition, Guatemala\
  \ underwent an abrupt transition upon the conquistadors\u2019 invasion in the 16th\
  \ century, with natives becoming slaves in their own homeland.\n\nSensing my horror,\
  \ Manuel, eyes fixated on the countryside, repeated his mantra.\n\n\u201CWhatever\
  \ you\u2019re thinking, it gets worse.\u201D\n\nIn the 1980s, Manuel explained,\
  \ hundreds of thousands of indigenous Maya, accused of communist mutiny, were slaughtered\
  \ by the Guatemalan government. Hundreds of villages were destroyed, and millions\
  \ of locals were displaced. \n\nA Kaqchikel Maya himself, Manuel let his words trail\
  \ behind him; he was visibly scarred by the tragedy.\n\nAn ominous glance my way,\
  \ the first time Manuel had broken eye contact with the ravine, suggested there\
  \ was more to come. \n\n\u201CHere,\u201D he said, pointing at the greenery. \u201C\
  Here is where they brought the bodies.\u201D\n\nManuel explained that while Comalapa\
  \ is now known for its painters, during the genocide, it was a notorious dumping\
  \ ground for cadavers.\n\nWhile Manuel hasn\u2019t seen his sister for 35 years,\
  \ there are many unidentified cadavers in the ravine and throughout Guatemala. \n\
  \nManuel was right."
