Text: "No party please!, is what I thought about Ibiza. Until someone said, that party\
  \ is really just a very small part of the entire island. But I still had no plans\
  \ of going there, until two new travel-colleagues talked me into it.\n\nI arrived\
  \ with a heart that had just started to heal, from a love broken due to misunderstandings,\
  \ not at all looking and neither wanting to get involved with any man, and didn\u2019\
  t think much of the place itself either, other than, just another mediterranean\
  \ island. \n\nWithin my first week, staying at a flat with a few other girls, a\
  \ German guy named Niravan, who happened to know some of the girls, started coming\
  \ around to see me, very confidently wanting to know me more, and showed me the\
  \ whole island. \n\nIn a few days I found myself realising, that international families\
  \ and people from nearly everywhere live on this island, and it turned out to be\
  \ the first place where my answer to \u201Cwhere are you from\u201D, to which I,\
  \ the international blooded globetrotter, prefer to just say ,,Europe\u201D was\
  \ totally accepted without any further questions. \nI started feeling like, this\
  \ could be my place, here I am understood. And on top of that, it\u2019s in Europe!,\
  \ and it has so many all different and all beautiful places of stunning and all\
  \ cool nature. Next I began wondering if this might actually be the place I have\
  \ been looking for, the place to \u201Cdrop my suitcases\u201D, my kind of place.\
  \ \nThen it hit me that it gets all quiet, empty and deserted-like during the winters,\
  \ and I was sold. Finally I found a place to possibly settle, and finally make a\
  \ home base.\n\nOne of the loveliest girls from my flat (Bulgarian like my mother,\
  \ who died when I was 16 months old) became my best friend, and took me yachting\
  \ all the time. It became one of the two best summers in my life, and I ended up\
  \ staying the whole summer, well into october, till the season had ended, past all\
  \ closing parties, to which I didn\u2019t go, and fell deeply in love with Niravan.\n\
  \nNiravan is someone who loves to make fun of people, by making them fall for silly\
  \ untrue stories, and tried to make me believe in fish that fly, and that there\
  \ should be dolphins around this west-mediterranean european island. But towards\
  \ the end of my stay, he took me Jet-skiing along the wild coast of the north, and\
  \ I saw both flying fish and dolphins, but also a huge 1meter turtle up close.\n\
  \nThat following winter, at age 30, I felt homesick for the first time in my life.\
  \ Everything about Ibiza was the last thing I expected."
