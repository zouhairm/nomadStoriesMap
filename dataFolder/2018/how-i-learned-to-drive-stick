Text: "I swung my feet onto the cold floor of my canvas-walled tent, moaning and clutching\
  \ my stomach. I knew that working in the tiny, remote town of McCarthy, Alaska,\
  \ my idea of \u201Ccomfort\u201D would change, but this did not seem normal. I zipped\
  \ on a fleece, and walked through the gnarled spruce trees to the \u201Cguides\u2019\
  \ lounge\u201D\u2014the only Wi-Fi in the vicinity\u2014and called my mom in New\
  \ York.\n\n\u201CSounds like appendicitis, you better see a doctor.\u201D I groaned\
  \ that Anchorage was an 8-hour drive and that my shift in the Wrangell Mountain\
  \ Air office was starting. Once there, my boss, Laura, a warm, veteran McCarthyite,\
  \ greeted me as she bustled around the tiny office. Her blue eyes narrowed as I\
  \ explained that, well, my mom thinks I need a doctor\u2026\n\n\u201CYup, now,\u201D\
  \ said Laura, already searching the manifest for a spot on the morning flight to\
  \ Chitina, the closest town. Within 15 minutes I was on a 6-seat bush plane with\
  \ Austin, a young, red-bearded pilot, on his way to pick up clients. Another pilot,\
  \ Toby, had a car in Chitina I was to drive to Glennallen, the nearest town with\
  \ a clinic. Soaring over winding glaciers, braided rivers and mountain peaks, I\
  \ suddenly spit into my headset, \u201CIs Toby\u2019s car manual or automatic?\u201D\
  \ Austin wasn\u2019t sure. \"Maybe Toby\u2019s flyin\u2019 around up here,\u201D\
  \ he drawled, and then, flicking a switch, \u201CHey, Toby, you here?\u201D A moment\
  \ later, Toby responded\u2014the car was stick, which I had never driven.\n\nA true\
  \ bush pilot, Austin didn\u2019t let me panic and proceeded to explain driving manual.\
  \ The Chitina airstrip came into view. We landed and Austin approached the waiting\
  \ tourists to say, \u201CExcuse me, folks, this young lady needs the hospital. Would\
  \ y\u2019all let me get her set up with a car?\u201D After some nods and \u201C\
  Oh yes, no problems,\u201D Austin led me to the most beat up car in the lot. Removing\
  \ the 2x4 wedged under the parking brake, he gave me a ten-minute lesson. He told\
  \ me people had done WAY crazier to survive in Alaska, gave me a pat, and went to\
  \ his clients. I haltingly drove the 1.5 hours to Glennallen, only to be told the\
  \ clinic had no doctors or imaging machinery. I had to get to Anchorage.\n\nThere\
  \ was no way I was going to drive that car into real city traffic. I called Laura,\
  \ who miraculously arranged for a friend to close down her Glennallen office and\
  \ drive me the remaining hours. At the ER, I learned that my appendix had indeed\
  \ ruptured, and, later, that my pathology indicated cancer. Fortunately, Alaska\
  \ had just taught me: With a little help, I can handle anything."
