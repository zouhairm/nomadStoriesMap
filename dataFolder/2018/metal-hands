Text: "It was 9:00pm and we were in the back of a faded yellow cab meandering up a\
  \ dusty lane not far from Chandra Airport, Kolkata. We were searching for the couch\
  \ surfing apartment Nathan and I had arranged. As we drove, the lights of the cab\
  \ illuminated a weather beaten metal sign that read Pratapgarh. A minute or two\
  \ later we alighted into the cool night and gently rustled the watchman awake, handing\
  \ him a piece of paper with Prakash\u2019s name and apartment 23 scribbled on it.\
  \ He understood. Nathan slip the watchman a 100 rupee note as he turned to leave\
  \ us.\n\nPrakash opened the door, beaming, \u201Chello my friends, come in, there\
  \ are Kingfishers in the fridge and on the stove I\u2019ve cooked Biriyani\u201D\
  \ he paused a moment, hesitating, looking at us a little closer\u2026 \u201Cwith\
  \ chicken, you do eat chicken?\u201D\n\nWe did eat chicken. \n\nIt was both our\
  \ first trips to the Indian sub-continent and Prakash wasted no time before starting\
  \ to explain the more idiosyncratic aspects of what to expect. \n\n\u201CBook a\
  \ Volkswagen bus if possible\u201D\n\nWe continued listening\n\n\u201CThere are\
  \ dirty Baba\u2019s (bad) and there are clean Baba\u2019s (good)\u201D\n\nIs that\
  \ so? I thought, nodding knowingly.\n\n\u201CThe older generation would prefer you\
  \ to eat with your hands\u201D\n\nI\u2019m going to like this place.\n\nI had been\
  \ watching Prakash eat with his hands, forming a small hook with his forefingers,\
  \ holding the food there for a moment and then pushing the Biriyani into his mouth\
  \ with the back of his thumb. The process was juxtaposing against the put together\
  \ disposition he propelled. I realised in that moment, that the contradiction between\
  \ his cleanness of being and his ostensibly uncleanliness of eating was a localised\
  \ embodiment of India. A land of beautiful inconsistencies, that left you surprised,\
  \ engaged and perplexed by the complexities of the arrangement.\n\nWe heard a tentative\
  \ knock on the front door. \n\nPrakash stood and walked to it. Nathan and I peered\
  \ around his shoulder from our relative positions on the floor. Our host let out\
  \ a jovial sigh and beckoned his new guests in; Nathan and I were taken aback. Before\
  \ us stood what appeared to be a Metallica cover band, in full performance garb.\
  \ Prakash explained that he moonlighted as an event organiser and had a small metal\
  \ gig going on tonight.\n\n\u201CYou boys want to go?\u201D\n\nWe had been in India\
  \ for three hours. \n\nWe looked at each other for a moment, amusement settling\
  \ across our faces. We turned to Prakash and both let out a resounding \u201CYes\u201D\
