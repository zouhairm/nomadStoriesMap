Text: "Nature is bound by disruption; the universe has been crafted through a mysterious\
  \ expansion through which we derive beauty. I would like to show the world that\
  \ peace comes with acceptance of nature\u2019s imperfections. \nI came to this realization\
  \ while sitting upon a grassy hilltop on the Big Island. Looking out at the vast\
  \ expanse of nature before me, I traced the scars of the mountain. Following the\
  \ paths of former lava flows with my imagination, I saw a strange kind of destruction\
  \ that somehow facilitated the creation of new ecosystems. Biological diversity\
  \ is scattered and cracked. Somehow these varying consistencies of soil and shrubbery\
  \ seemed\u2026 serene. Rubble has no prejudice. \nStrumming my guitar, I fell into\
  \ a deep serenity that embodied my soul. Each chord acted as a catharsis of negative\
  \ thought. The melodies in my head rang true, we can find beauty in the imperfect.\
  \ Self-judgement became irrelevant as my insecurities were absorbed by the diverse\
  \ \u2018aina. The soft clouds above me seemingly held all of the answers; each occurrence\
  \ in life has meaning, so we must accept and move on. You see, these frozen water\
  \ particles in the sky have floated around the world seeing every visible emotion\
  \ and action of a human being. They dropped snow on my skin as I paced outside the\
  \ emergency room doors, hoping to see my father's smiling face once again. They\
  \ dropped rain onto my face, hiding the tears as I said goodbye to New Hampshire.\
  \ They colored the backdrop of pink and red, as my mother genuinely spoke, \u201C\
  your flaws are perfect to me.\" My personality had been molded by these experiences,\
  \ and like the grass and the clouds, painted my own personal portrait. \nThese elements\
  \ of nature provoked a new awareness of my surroundings. Judgement was pushed aside\
  \ and I was able to see society in a new light: a group of imperfect people making\
  \ mistakes and growing together. If nature is composed of irregular texture and\
  \ color, and personality is a product of one\u2019s environment, then as a result\
  \ the human race can never be uniform. Our beautiful cracks have illustrated a history\
  \ so magnificent, even the molten rock flowing miles beneath my feet is in awe.\
  \ I find my abstract perfection through exploration. Each element in the environment\
  \ has a purpose, therefore deserves to be treated with respect. This includes every\
  \ human being."
