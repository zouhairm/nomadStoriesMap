Text: "The floor made of sand creaked rhythmically under my feet. Ocean breeze flowed\
  \ through the invisible walls, surrounded by the island\u2019s lush jungle paths.\
  \ Giggling, they were building secret spaces among the comfy cushions, ignoring\
  \ my presence. I was marveling at the world that was unfolding before my eyes. I\u2019\
  ve been dreaming of this place for more than two years. Arriving felt like remembering\
  \ everything I knew and somehow forgot. \n\n\u201EMiss, what are you looking for?\u201C\
  \ \n\u201EThe treehouse,\u201D I replied to the voice behind the mangoes. \n\u201C\
  Oh, it\u2019s just there\u201D, Mon said, pointing at the sign \u201CWelcome home.\u201D\
  \n\nHome it became, with Mon\u2019s delicious massaman curry, its remote location,\
  \ misty mountains and travelers from all walks of life. The Earth was singing. Or\
  \ was it my five-year-old heart? Ever since \u201CThe Beach\u201D, the book by Alex\
  \ Garland, I wanted to find a piece of paradise as Richard did. What I found was\
  \ worse. It was real. \n\nLife was lived above the ground, 80 meters from the Long\
  \ Beach. Marilyn was in charge with her daughter Jessie. I feared her eyes for they\
  \ were deeper than the ocean where the glowing plankton swam. She fed us with homemade\
  \ yogurt, cooked ginger and stories such as, I remember Jimi Hendrix playing\u2026\
  \n\nThe little treehouse community consisted both from travelers and the cockroaches.\
  \ Days were filled with taking care of our home and each other. Whether it was watering\
  \ the plants, dusting the bookshelves or making mojitos in the bar, the treehouse\
  \ was filled with sweat and something else that did not belong to human origin.\
  \ Everyone seemed genuinely happy.\n\nKoh Lanta was an escape for starved generations.\
  \ Barefoot and curious, we were finding calm and joy in ordinary. Matt the Englishman\
  \ was a craftsman, constantly competing with the wood destroying bugs. Franco was\
  \ a coffee guy. Nothing could match that simple, shocking excitement of a cold bamboo\
  \ shower and Franco\u2019s coconut \u201Ccaf\xE9\u201D in the morning. He carried\
  \ smiles in his pockets.\n\nDid the Sea Gypsies, who have occupied the area for\
  \ hundreds of years, feel what I felt in this tropical heaven? The journey of the\
  \ sun reminded me that all things have an ending, but I did not want to leave. I\
  \ felt like I belonged. \n\n\u201CYou see that island there?\u201D \n\u201CYeah,\
  \ it seems quite distant.\u201D\n\u201CHave you ever seen The Beach movie?\u201D\
  \ he continued.\n\u201CSo many times\u201D quietly I replied. \n\u201CWell, that\
  \ beach is just there\u201D.\n\nThe traveler dusted the sand off his shorts and\
  \ left."
