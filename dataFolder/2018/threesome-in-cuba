Text: "After spending a couple of\_stunning\_days in Havana, it was time to get our\
  \ rental car and\_begin our adventure\_through this beautiful country. As we were\
  \ patiently waiting, our\_young receptionist approached\_us,\_to explain that our\
  \ car was broken.\_And\_due to limited resources, they wouldn\u2019t be able to\
  \ give to us another one. But they had a solution! They were going to give us a\
  \ taxi with a driver for the next 12 days. Our faces dropped. Our\_hearts sank\_\
  to the bottom of the ocean.\_Then and there, our romantic holiday for two, was now\_\
  suddenly a threesome.\n\_\nIt wasn\u2019t long until we learned, our Cuban driver\
  \ Henry, was also a stranger in this country. We knew that Cubans couldn\u2019t\
  \ leave their country but what we didn\u2019t know was that many have never even\
  \ travelled further than their own towns. This was mainly due to a lack of public\
  \ transportation. And the ban on Cubans staying in the hotels. Plus, travelling\
  \ was a luxury. And Henry was no exception. At that moment, we realised\_this wasn\u2019\
  t\_going\_to be\_an ordinary trip. This was the journey of a lifetime, for Henry\
  \ and we were going to be the drivers of it.\n\nHenry\u2019s favourite phrase was,\
  \ \u2018We\u2019re living in the 21st\_century\u2019. I wasn\u2019t sure if he was\
  \ aware of what that\_actually\_meant,\_in a country where neither technology,\_\
  nor toilet paper is available to most\_of the\_people. But how could we tell him\
  \ that in our 21st\_century, we didn\u2019t dance in town squares anymore, kids\
  \ didn\u2019t play on the street, we didn\u2019t hang out with friends much and\
  \ when we did, we were busy virtually chatting to other people on our phones. Our\
  \ 21st\_century was very different to the one he had in mind. And I guessed he\u2019\
  d figure that out on our first night at the hotel, whilst flicking through\_the\
  \ multitude of\_channels on his satellite TV.\n\_\nThroughout the trip, Henry would\
  \ convince us to pick up locals and drive them wherever they needed to go. He would\
  \ take us\_off\_the\_beaten track, allowing us to interact with\_an array of Cubans\_\
  and have experiences which we would never\_have\_had by ourselves.\_It turns out,\
  \ the threesome\_we\u2019d\_feared, was an unexpected delight."
