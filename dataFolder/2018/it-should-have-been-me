Text: "The humidity hit me right in the face as the plane landed at Newark Airport\
  \ and the air hostesses opened the passenger door. I stayed seated and glared out\
  \ the window still trying to comprehend the fact that I\u2019m in America for 12\
  \ months. It was cloudy and grey outside but it would be scorching hot by midday.\n\
  I felt anxious about going through US Customs and answering tedious questions about\
  \ what I\u2019m doing here, where I\u2019m staying, and when do I plan on returning\
  \ to the UK.\nNever, I secretly thought to myself. \n\u201COne year from today.\
  \ I\u2019m on a strict working visa contract,\u201D I whispered to myself with a\
  \ stern smile, hoping the officer would take me seriously.\n\u201COkay. Where are\
  \ you staying?\u201D He would probe me further.\n\u201CAn apartment in New York.\
  \ I have the address here,\u201D I rummaged through my paperwork indicating the\
  \ address on the letter in front of him but he waves me away. \nI walk towards the\
  \ baggage claim and take everything in. I was going to be living in the heart of\
  \ New York City, with a new job and maybe even a new guy. This was the perfect way\
  \ to leave my past behind me and start a new chapter.\nMy mind began to drift home.\
  \ Not another flashback, I thought to myself. I\u2019ve already had three. I blinked\
  \ my eyes open and shut as hard as I possibly could but I couldn\u2019t stop seeing\
  \ the hospital bed, the old terraced house and the white tombstone.\n\u201CAre you\
  \ okay?\u201D a stranger approached me.\n\u201CMhh-hmm\u201D I nodded in response\
  \ as I looked up at the man standing before me. He was tall and slim. I stared blankly\
  \ at him as I gathered my thoughts.\n \u201CUrm it\u2019s Mark? Mark Michael from\
  \ Honda? You weren\u2019t supposed to land for another 20 minutes but I got here\
  \ early.\u201D\nHe was tall and slim. He had dark brown hair and blue eyes, thin\
  \ lips that unveiled white pearly teeth. He looked New York. \nWe walked towards\
  \ to the exit. He lead and I followed suit. I noticed people waiting for their loved\
  \ ones. Families, friends, children, men in suits with names written in bold and\
  \ black ink all waiting for someone to turn up.\nIt was a long walk to the terminal\
  \ car park but Mark kindly offered to carry my bags. We stopped outside his silver\
  \ Honda car while he rummaged for the car keys in his pocket. He opened the trunk\
  \ of the car to store my luggage and handed me an umbrella.\n\u201CYou\u2019re going\
  \ to need this.\u201D\nI must have looked confused because I was staring up at the\
  \ grey sky. The sun was beginning to peek through the clouds.\nThe last thing I\
  \ was expecting was for it to rain in July."
