Text: "If you have ever gotten the chance to explore Gig Harbor, Washington, you know\
  \ that it has a lot to offer. Tourists love the calm waterfronts and the endless\
  \ choices of water activities. When I visited this town, I spent most of my time\
  \ down by the docks enjoying the beautiful scenery. Surprisingly, the water was\
  \ not the best part of spending my time down by the dock, there are plenty of locals\
  \ who live on houseboats, fisherman, and people traveling along Washington\u2019\
  s coast and are just stopping by. My favorite encounter was a man I saw on the water\
  \ in his boat, seemingly purposefully attempting to capsize his boat. \n\nAfter\
  \ watching him for a few minutes I joked with him, \u201CUsually you wouldn\u2019\
  t want it to do that.\u201D \n\nHe chuckled, \u201CI built this boat, I am testing\
  \ it.\u201D I looked at the boat in surprise, \u201CYou built that?\u201D He pointed\
  \ to the logo decal on the back of the boat reading \u201CGig Harbor Boats\u201D\
  \ saying, \u201CI work at a boat building company, I personally custom-make all\
  \ the boats.\u201D Introducing myself, I replied, \u201CThat\u2019s amazing. I\u2019\
  m Emberley.\u201D He shook my hand, responding \u201CJohn.\u201D \n\nWe talked for\
  \ a while until we found ourselves at the nearby shop. Quickly, I noticed the plenty\
  \ of boats out front. John guided me inside where I had the chance to meet the founder\
  \ of the company, Matt Smith. I had the chance to talk to Matt and John for awhile\
  \ as they gave me a tour around the shop.\n\n I asked Matt, \u201C How did Gig Harbor\
  \ Boats come to be? How did you decide to open your own shop?\u201D \n\n\u201C Well,\u201D\
  \ He pauses for a second, \u201C I grew up rowing and sailing, It was something\
  \ I was always interested in and enjoyed. Eventually I took up the task of building\
  \ my own boat. That boat caught people\u2019s eyes, I had people coming to me at\
  \ the dock asking about her,and my friends all wanted me to build their own. I started\
  \ building a few for my friends and that turned into more. It kept going until one\
  \ day I was building a small shop on my property and creating what is Gig Harbor\
  \ Boats. Forty-something years later and I\u2019m still here doing it so I guess\
  \ we have done pretty good. But really I just enjoyed doing it, plus it wasn\u2019\
  t that bad of a commute.\u201D He chuckled as he points to his home across the yard.\n\
  \n  Later on down the road, he would hire his son-in-law, John, to become part of\
  \ the company and help him extend his legacy."
