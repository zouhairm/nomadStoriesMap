Text: "I never thought that at the age of 17 I would be making one of the biggest\
  \ decisions of my life, moving country, alone. I had been brought up with travel\
  \ in my blood, my mother being an English hostess for British Airways and my father\
  \ being a South African backpacker and photographer. It was always our family\u2019\
  s plan to see the world together but when my father was diagnosed with cancer and\
  \ passed away, all the plans disappeared. We stayed in England for my whole childhood,\
  \ but I still had to urge to experience new cultures, countries and people.  As\
  \ money was never in our favour, I focussed on my education to be my door to the\
  \ world. At  17 it I had a pretty full plate, with trying to achieve my A-level\
  \ qualifications,  working two job and also applying to international universities,\
  \ understanding visa and permits at such a young age, but I was more than determined\
  \ knowing that it would provide me with a new life that I had dreamt of.  On the\
  \ 16th of June 2016 I received an offer to one of the top 50 Universities in the\
  \ world, University of British Columbia with an Outstanding International Student\
  \ Scholarship. Overwhelmed was an understatement. The realisation that I would get\
  \ the opportunity to finally see the world but also that I would be moving across\
  \ the world from my family was difficult. I was allowed to defer my offer from 2016\
  \ to 2017 giving myself a year to get used to being away from home but also spend\
  \ quality time with my family before I moved. In my year, I carried on working my\
  \ two jobs full time allowing myself to save money but also scheduling them in a\
  \ way which I could also use to travel. I saved up enough to take my mum on holiday\
  \ to the Canary Islands, backpack Thailand for a month, visit my family in South\
  \ Africa who I had not seen in 12 years and go to Venice for my birthday. All which\
  \ I independently funded. I found a new home in my backpack and a family with the\
  \ people in the places I visited who showed me their cultures. The year passed quickly\
  \ and before I knew it was packing my belongings in a suitcase and moving out of\
  \ my family home. On the 21st of August 2017 I got on a plane to Canada with a one\
  \ way ticket and two suitcases containing my life. I have now been living here for\
  \ 6 months attending the University and also working with the International Student\
  \ Recruitment team developing ways to reach out of other students around the world\
  \ to show that you can travel and learn no matter your background in life."
