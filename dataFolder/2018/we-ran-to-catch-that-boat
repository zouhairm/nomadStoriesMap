Text: "We are running in the little village of Huay Xai located in the north of Laos\
  \ to catch the boat that would sail on the Mekong river for two days and one night.\n\
  \u201CWe don\u2019t want to wait for the next boat\u201D, Jeff says. \n\u201CWe\
  \ saw the village yesterday and this is a tourist village. We need to see a local\
  \ one\u201D, Jeff insists.\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, we will catch it\u201D says\
  \ Val.\nWe continue experiencing this gorgeous sunny day, where there is a slight\
  \ wind to cool us down and keep us from being sweaty and make us keep going with\
  \ dignity to reach our destination.\nWe think to buy a couple of things for the\
  \ trip like water and something to eat. There is a local shop on the way and we\
  \ decide to stop there. Inside the shop, we notice this cute lady in her 50s, dressed\
  \ in a modest way, cleaning the floor and it appears she just opened the shop. She\
  \ says to us, \u201CHello\u201D in her language, \u201CSabai Dee\u201D and she continues\
  \ cleaning the pavement with her old broom. We go around the little shop in a rushed\
  \ manner and we decide to buy chips and water. \nJeff sees coffee and wants it but\
  \ there is no time for that. At this moment the cute lady in a cute manner offers\
  \ to bring a small cup with hot water so Jeff can put the coffee in there and drink\
  \ it. \nJeff finally gets his coffee and drinks it making him happy and wide awake.\
  \ \nWe thank the old lady saying, \u201CKhob Jai\u201D to her. She thanks us back\
  \ and bows her head. We continue running on the main road where on both sides there\
  \ are small houses and they are built in a humble and unexceptional base way on\
  \ both sides of the small road.\nWe keep running and we get close to the boat. We\
  \ move faster and there we see from up above there is the small harbour below. We\
  \ made it!  \nThe harbour is small but it embodies the spirit of the nature here.\
  \ The background is full of green trees with the blue sky and the clouds being amazingly\
  \ white, making them suitable for each other. The nature reveals itself on her majesty\
  \ and you can just stay still and contemplate upon it. The sight on the small boats\
  \ through all this nature is so charming. The nature reveals itself on her majesty\
  \ and you can just stay still and contemplate upon it.\nWe begin to move towards\
  \ the boats. There are different boats and they are all made of wood and with a\
  \ green color with clothes hanging outside. \nOur boat is the one really close to\
  \ the harbour and we ask if this is the boat to Luang Prabang. They confirm it is\
  \ and we are happy to know that we finally made it and reached the boat."
