Text: "15th July 2017. I landed on Istanbul airport, a tired and jet lagged but almost\
  \ hysterically excited 21 year old, who had stood in the line for 3 hours to get\
  \ past immigration, determined to use her 22 hour layover (yes, the things we do\
  \ for cheap flights) to visit the city of dreams, the city of Hagia Sophia.\nBut\
  \ when do things ever go as planned?\n\nPast Immigration, I entered the land of\
  \ Chaos. \nI had stood their foolishly along with a few other tourists who were\
  \ unfortunate enough to travel on that fateful night, when it happened. With the\
  \ tension that was palpable in the air, the bang felt like a bomb, and we ran clutching\
  \ only our dearest things. I, my passport, the man next to me, his little daughter.\
  \ Anywhere. Everywhere. \nIt was the night of the Military Coup in Turkey.\nOne\
  \ of those incidents that you see in the news, read and turn the page. Only now,\
  \ I could not turn the page when I heard the gunshots and no official was present\
  \ to tell me what in the world was going on.\n\nMy wishful tour of the 'City of\
  \ Seven Hills' turned into an exploration of the Ataturk Airport. \nI discovered\
  \ that check-in desks have massive space under them, and it smells like an old shoe-box\
  \ but its big enough to shelter me and the Palestinian mother. \nI learnt how we\
  \ can comfort solely with our eyes, mumbling reassurances without even knowing the\
  \ other person\u2019s name, that empathy has no language.\nLooking at her daughter\
  \ clinging to her, I knew achingly that from then on I would hug my mother a little\
  \ tighter.\nThe relief I felt when Saad, a Pakistani, asked me anxiously in heavily\
  \ accented Hindi, if I am from Hindustan made me realize how through all the veils\
  \ we wear of nationalities and race, we are bound by the same thread, governed by\
  \ the same fears.  \nAnd when an embarrassed shopkeeper invited me inside his shop\
  \ to hide, his face washed in guilt over what was no fault of his whatsoever, I\
  \ learnt how helpless we all are in suffering, but that\u2019s when our kindness\
  \ shines the brightest.\nI spent the night, hungry and without water, scared and\
  \ numb, running and hiding in the unlikeliest of places. I was finally allowed to\
  \ board my flight 29 hours later. Totally spent, I said goodbye to the city that\
  \ I couldn't visit but somehow had taught me the most it could. Taking off over\
  \ the sleepy spires of Istanbul, I dozed off feeling almost excited to have lived\
  \ through it, thankful for the courage it had planted in my heart that in the most\
  \ barren landscape of fear, I would be okay."
