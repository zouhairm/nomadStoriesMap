Text: "I had to get off my bicycle and push. Even though I was on tarmac, on the flat,\
  \ and had left my panniers at the Waitiki campsite, the gusts of wind were so strong\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t keep myself on the left side of the road. The traffic in\
  \ the opposite direction was light, November wasn\u2019t yet New Zealand\u2019s\
  \ peak season, but after Google image searching Cape Reinga for the last four years,\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to risk get myself squashed by a campervan now that I was only\
  \ ten miles away. I turned a corner and the wind abated. I pedalled on. Eight miles.\
  \ It started to spit with rain. Five miles. My quads were shaking from the short,\
  \ steep hills. Three miles. A family overtook in a car and they waved through the\
  \ window. I smiled through gasps for breath. One mile away. I kept pushing.\nI locked\
  \ up my bike and walked out onto the blustery outcrop that was almost the northerly\
  \ tip of New Zealand. The end of the highway, at least. In Maori culture it\u2019\
  s the edge of the mortal world too, where spirits leave Aotearoa for the underworld.\n\
  The wind whipped my hair. The air tasted of salt. Where the Tasman Sea met the Pacific\
  \ Ocean was bisected with a line of white chop as the currents clashed. A lone tree\
  \ clung the rocks, battling the spray. It felt like a special and sacred place.\
  \ I was overwhelmed, humble and grateful. I was so familiar with the views from\
  \ Instagram and now I was really in them. Footpaths were worn through the grass\
  \ as others before me had made their way to unofficial lookouts.\nI\u2019d made\
  \ it to my new beginning, the start of my top-to-bottom cycle tour. Next stop: Bluff,\
  \ the almost-most-southerly tip of New Zealand. As far as my legs could take me,\
  \ however long my head and heart would let me. I\u2019d left my job in a supermarket,\
  \ and the security it afforded, to find where the edges of my capabilities lay.\
  \ Riding 400 miles from Auckland hadn\u2019t touched them, neither had camping in\
  \ the sand dunes when the headwind had slowed me up so much I missed the tide window\
  \ and would have gotten stuck on Ninety Mile Beach. I was saying \u2018not yet,\
  \ maybe never\u2019 to the things that were expected of me, and had started something\
  \ else entirely.\nI looked out past the headland, past the rocks and the plants\
  \ too stubborn to be put off by salt water and poor soil, past the crashing waves\
  \ and brewing clouds. I was definitely doing the right thing. I had pushed my way\
  \ to one edge, and had 2000 miles more to ride before I\u2019d reach another."
