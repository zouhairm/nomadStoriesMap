Text: "I waded into the natural infinity pool overlooking the waterfall I had hiked\
  \ an hour to see and lay down on a huge rock overlooking the spectacular view. The\
  \ rock had a slipperiness to it that would arouse jealousy in your childhood Slip-n-Slide,\
  \ which should have been my second clue, right after the common sense of don\u2019\
  t lie down on the edge of a waterfall, but this place was magical. Colombia is beautiful,\
  \ with its mountains and jungles, and verdant colors that were such a change from\
  \ the gray sky and corn-yellow dreariness of rural Wisconsin, but as every fresh-faced\
  \ high school graduate embarking on their first journey outside of the walls that\
  \ swallowed up four years of their life, I was looking to find myself. What that\
  \ means, I don\u2019t know, but I sure hoped that somewhere between the Spanish\
  \ lessons and hikes through the jungle a coconut would fall on my head and I\u2019\
  d wake up with a renewed zest for life. \n\nThe last thing I expected was to have\
  \ the current grab hold of my leg and flip me around, pulling me towards the edge.\
  \ In the split second I realized I was going over this waterfall, I became hyper\
  \ aware of two things, 1. slippery rocks are extremely difficult to grab on to,\
  \ a lesson learned as my hands flailed desperately, and 2. there were only rocks\
  \ waiting for me at the bottom of this fall. My life flashed as I realized my parents\
  \ were going to get a call saying I had died falling off a waterfall in Colombia,\
  \ or at the very least was paralyzed from the neck down. I felt a pang of guilt\
  \ as I thought about my friends who would have to drag my lifeless body up the steep\
  \ slope we came down. What an inconvenient place to die.\n\nWham! I faintly heard\
  \ the screams of my friends as the water pounded down around me. I could still hear!\
  \ I felt for my toes and was amazed when they wiggled in response. I got up to see\
  \ our guide standing on the dry rock beside me, saying something in Spanish translated\
  \ for me much later by a friend as, \u201CNo one's ever taken a fall like that...\
  \ and lived.\"\n\nI didn\u2019t die that day, but a small part of me did. The part\
  \ of me that said it was okay to sit around and wait for life to come your way.\
  \ The part that would rather get hit with a coconut than seek out adventure. In\
  \ the coming days, I would count time with the fresh bruises on my arm and cut on\
  \ my elbow, made worse by a clumsy fall in the shower, and as I watched these marks\
  \ come and go from my body, I embraced the knowledge that I had done something worth\
  \ living for."
