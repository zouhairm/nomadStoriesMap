Text: "I wrestled with my right foot as it refused to yield from its soggy cage. The\
  \ much anticipated Ghanaian rainstorm had arrived when I least expected it and as\
  \ a consequence the hard, orange terrain of the village of Kasapin had become squelchy\
  \ and had turned the color of blood red. As I struggled to free myself from the\
  \ middle of the path my mind filled with terror as I contemplated the idea that\
  \ I might be stuck, permanently. I inhaled deeply, then exhaled. As I was just managing\
  \ to take control of the rational part of my mind once again, I was interrupted\
  \ by the typical village greeting, \n\n\u201C\u03B5te s\u03B5n?\u201D A deep voice\
  \ bellowed at me, muffled by the sound of pounding rain on tin roofs. \n\n\u201C\
  \u03B5y\u03B5!\u201D I responded with my best Twi, clearly lying. I was far from\
  \ fine.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t think so Obroni, why don\u2019t you come inside?\u201D\
  \ He gesticulated towards the 5 pieces of corrugated metal that constituted the\
  \ four walls and roof of his house. His openness was intimidating at first, but\
  \ his smile filled me with trust and besides, what else was I going to do?\n\nThis\
  \ is how I met Knox: the man that inspired me to live with trust rather than fear,\
  \ the man that showed me that true wealth expands beyond the car you drive and the\
  \ house you own, the man that taught me that generosity has no limits and that family\
  \ is more than just blood. \n\nAs I passed the whole afternoon with Knox, his wife,\
  \ and their six children, I was amazed at how their happiness shone through at every\
  \ moment, how the house was so full of laughter and warmth. Whilst Knox and I washed\
  \ the dishes after our mashed yam, I took the opportunity to ask the question that\
  \ had been on my mind since I arrived. I looked him in the eyes and asked, \u201C\
  Knox, what is it that makes you so happy? You and your family laugh so much and\
  \ in my country people live in mansions, drive the car of their dreams and they\
  \ never seem to even break into a smile.\u201D\n\nHe chuckled to himself, a boyish\
  \ intoxicating chuckle. His eyes met mine as he said, \u201CYou know what I do whenever\
  \ I\u2019m feeling sorry for myself? When I know my family are hungry and we haven\u2019\
  t got any food, when my children have malaria and we can\u2019t buy their medication,\
  \ do you know what I do?\u201D\n\nHe paused, allowing me to consider the question.\
  \ I shook my head. \n\n\u201CI find someone to help that\u2019s even more down than\
  \ me, that special someone that\u2019s stuck in the mud and needs a helping hand.\u201D\
  \ He looked at me and broke into a wide, cheeky grin. \u201CAnd today my friend,\
  \ that person was you!\u201D"
