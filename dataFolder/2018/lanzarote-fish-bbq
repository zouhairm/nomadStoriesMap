Text: "For the second year in a row me and my friend we went on this late autumn vacation\
  \ looking for some sunshine and warm weather. Last year we visited the Azore Islands\
  \ and this ear we went to Lanzarote island. \nWe did not want to just sunbathe and\
  \ swim all day. Although a bit slowed down the rhythm, but still quite actively\
  \ discovering this beautiful island. We had rented a car and each day we went on\
  \ a trip to see some interesting parts of the island \u2013 from breathtaking beaches\
  \ and caves to lava fields, cactus and aloe vera gardens, etc. \nAs we wanted to\
  \ try out some local food as well, our house owner suggested to go to the fish market\
  \ and buy some fresh fish that we could grill on BQQ.  We did as he suggested..\
  \ \nI love swimming and was so happy we had a small pool in or rental hose. Every\
  \ day I swam for about an hour.\nThat evening I was swimming and thinking about\
  \ the great BBQ we will have just in a short while. Swimming back and forwards and\
  \ all of a sudden I saw a cat sitting on the other side of the pool. My first instinct\
  \ was to get out of the pool and close terrace door that was wide open. I closed\
  \ the door and went back swimming. But the cat was still there. As if he came especially\
  \ for to our fish BBQ. How did he know that it was tonight? Fish was in the fridge,\
  \ so he could not yet smell it\u2026.\nAnd since that night cat stayed with us.\
  \ The next morning while walking around the shop and trying to remember everything\
  \ we had to buy, my friends 3year old son brought us to the cat food section and\
  \ said \u2013 we have to buy some food for OUR cat. \nSo for the rest of our vacation\
  \ \u2013 during the day we went to see some amazing places of Lanzarote and then\
  \ once reached our house, we were running to the terrace door to see if our cat\
  \ is still there sitting and waiting for us to come home. \nAnd he was! Our local\
  \ Lanzarote friend that made us feel belonging to this place and willing to come\
  \ back to our temporary home. \nThe day before leaving the island, we checked the\
  \ GPS coordinates he had around his neck.He was a local. Living quite far away,\
  \ but I remembered learning that cats can wander quite far away from their home,\
  \ but they know how to find their way back home. So we knew he will get home. And\
  \ so did we have to do \u2013 go home. \nBut now when we remember our trip to Lanzarote,\
  \ we do remember these gorgeous places we visited, but surely this trip is also\
  \ marked by our cat. How is he doing? Was he angry that we had to leave? Did he\
  \ find his way back home?"
