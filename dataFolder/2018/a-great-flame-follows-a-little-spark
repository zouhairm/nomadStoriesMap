Text: "I am in the middle of an unknown road trying to make my way towards Milan.\
  \ Soaked by sweat, rain and tears, I pray to get safely home. \u201CSometimes\u201D\
  , I think, \u201CI really need to stay inside my comfort zone\u201D. Riding in the\
  \ dark, I am far away from my shadows, or maybe I am just getting closer\u2026\n\
  \nEver since I came to Italy, I have felt envious of the people riding their bikes\
  \ through the narrow intimate streets. Suffocated by the subway and my own loneliness,\
  \ I made a decision that completely changed my mindset. I traded my last earnings\
  \ for a rusty old mountain bike. It got the name Atlas, and it became my free ticket\
  \ to see Lombardia. Atlas led me to many micro-adventures and helped me explore\
  \ and experiment with my inner strength. \n\nI will never forget how I felt on the\
  \ route between Milan and Bergamo. It started on a rainy day in November, at the\
  \ outer city limits of Milan. The tour included three cyclists, none wise enough\
  \ to check the weather forecast. The road headed East towards the small town of\
  \ Gorgonzola, through its trail of artisanal cheese tents. After 40k of continuous\
  \ riding, the landscape changed to reveal an industrial park with factory pipes\
  \ and chimneys billowing fog. Soon after, the air cleared and began to unveil the\
  \ most important landmark of the city of Bergamo, Le Mura Veneziane. Biking across\
  \ the cobblestone, I could feel the atmospheric history of these beautiful walls,\
  \ which for six centuries have divided the heart of Bergamo\u2019s history (Citt\xE0\
  \ Alta) from its financial core (Citt\xE0 Bassa). \nHeavy rain broke my bike lights\
  \ and interrupted the moments of serenity. Alarmed, I started riding homewards ignoring\
  \ the excruciating pain in my back. Avoiding potholes, garbage and animal corpses,\
  \ I wondered, \u201CAm I going to end up like this?\u201D \nI was fighting the rain,\
  \ the road and myself. I thought about my anxieties and fears\u202670k already.\
  \ The night became darker as every minute of never-ending pedaling hours passed.\
  \ I got a flat tire, slippery brakes, and every possible complication that made\
  \ me consider quitting.\n\nJust when I thought I was never going to see light again,\
  \ Atlas started glowing. Its muddy green frame was reflecting the city lights that\
  \ indicate the entrance to Milan. I was back home.\nThe group stayed outside to\
  \ celebrate the miscalculation, that cost us 140k of an ego-forging road. Cheering\
  \ with a Grunge IPA beer, we returned to reality. \n\nI held Atlas and looked up\
  \ at the sky. Above me, I could see the stars."
