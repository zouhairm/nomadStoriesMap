Text: "The smoke of the fire pit hit my face as the wind picked up. I stared at it\
  \ intently, focusing on the egg I had placed on the edge of the pit. The coca leaves\
  \ in my pocket began to crumple and dampen from my sweaty hand. I still hadn\u2019\
  t read them and damaging them would make that difficult. Seated in my family\u2019\
  s backyard in Cochabamba, celebrating our Koa, I was filled with love and gratefulness\
  \ towards Pachamama and towards the warrior who had set me on my way.\nThe lack\
  \ of oxygen in the Bolivian air greeted me with the worst case of \u201Csea sickness\u201D\
  \ I\u2019d ever experienced, but the view of the mountains through the panes of\
  \ the airport gate made it worthwhile. I was, at once, as thirsty for the adventure\
  \ that had brought me to this new place as I was for water to temper my nausea.\n\
  From the moment I connected with my host family, they encouraged me to embrace the\
  \ culture. They introduced me to a great many things, including to their monthly\
  \ Koa celebration. Koa, a celebration of thanks to Pachamama, a ritual of the Andean\
  \ people. It is joyous, vast, and no two celebrations are the same. One of its traditions,\
  \ the exploding egg, would introduce me to the warrior Elena, the Revolutionary\
  \ Woman I had come to picture during my studies.\nAn older indigenous woman, Elena\
  \ had fought numerous Bolivian rebellions. She\u2019d fought for the working class\
  \ for a quarter of a century. Initially, she did so to give her children a better\
  \ life. Eventually she fought so that all children might have a better life. Participating\
  \ in numerous marches and protests she launched a turning point in Bolivia, surviving\
  \ countless physical and mental attacks. Now, she lay on her death bed, beaten by\
  \ cancer. \nI sat with Maria Elena a few days each week, exchanging our stories.\
  \ Our first conversations were awkward, two strangers coming to terms with an end\
  \ of who they\u2019d been. But like all small beginnings our affections for each\
  \ other grew, as did our convictions for the pursuit of social justice across the\
  \ world. Her whispered words blew life into the kindling of my dreams, and when\
  \ she grew too weak to speak, I continued to fan the flames with my resolve. \n\
  Lost in my memories of Maria Elena\u2019s ordeals, I was startled by a small explosion\
  \ in front of me. My egg had popped, sending sulfur and small sparks of fire into\
  \ the air. The custom dictated that now my wish for Maria Elena\u2019s peaceful\
  \ passing was to come true. I reached for a coca leaf; it was golden, a sign of\
  \ good fortune. \nMaria Elena passed away a few days later in her sleep."
