Text: "I\u2019m not the bravest person in the world. A couple of my friends spend\
  \ most weekends skydiving to get their adrenaline rush but I\u2019m lucky because\
  \ I get high from a trip in a glass elevator in a hotel lobby. So, imagine how I\
  \ felt when I arrived in Zhangjiajie National Park in China and discovered that\
  \ I had to ride a glass elevator up the side of 200 metre cliff. \n\nMost Westerners\
  \ haven\u2019t heard of Zhangjiajie, but when I told friends I was headed for the\
  \ place where James Cameron filmed Avatar, they looked a bit more impressed. In\
  \ truth, I chose Zhangjiajie for its photographs of mist mountains. I had no idea\
  \ that navigating the National Park was going to be like crossing a minefield for\
  \ sufferers of vertigo. It was not until I was overtaken by young women in miniskirts\
  \ and high heels, smoking grandfathers and women carrying five-year-old children\
  \ that I realised what I was in for. To get anywhere here, you need to climb hundreds\
  \ of steps that snake around mountain edges, peaks and gullies with intermittent\
  \ spine-chilling lookout stops. After climbing for two hours I arrived at a ticket\
  \ booth at the top of Tianmen mountain. I wasn\u2019t sure what the ticket was for,\
  \ so approached the window tentatively. \n\nAfter the usual exchange of arm waiving\
  \ and bemused expressions, the attendant pointed behind him. I could see people\
  \ taking selfies, texting and jumping up and down. I poked my head around the corner\
  \ and instantly felt cold sweat ripple across my body. I thought the glass elevator\
  \ and cable car swinging thousands of metres above the ground, were the most terrifying\
  \ amusements I\u2019d have to overcome. That was until I came face to face with\
  \ the glass walkway attached to the side of a cliff that had nothing but air below\
  \ it for as far down as the eye could see. As I marvelled at the genius and horror\
  \ of the 60-metre-long, 1430-metre-high path, I swear I heard it starting to crack.\
  \ \n\nAt that point I flew. Flew like a flight footed animal \u2013 across well-manicured\
  \ paths, down stairways, down escalators built inside mountains, down cable cars,\
  \ down anything that lead down. I didn\u2019t notice the sign offering \u201CVisitors\
  \ Precautions\u201D that recommended not to go on the glass bridge if wearing high\
  \ heels. Later I learned that the sound of cracking is a special effect built into\
  \ some of China\u2019s glass walkways just to frighten the tourists."
