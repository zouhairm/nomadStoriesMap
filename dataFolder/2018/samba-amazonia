Text: "The boat is in the harbor, looming impressively with its three-tiered yellow\
  \ and green bunting. The ticket is bought, the berth purchased. I say berth \u2013\
  \ it\u2019s more like a coffin-sized area I\u2019ve rented for the next three days,\
  \ roomy enough to fit my hammock but not to avoid elbowing my neighbor (and receiving\
  \ his rebuttals) in my sleep. Provisions have been procured, mosquito repellent\
  \ sprayed, malaria pills quaffed. It\u2019s time to brave the Amazon River, three\
  \ days on a boat, from Leticia in Colombia to Manaus in Brazil, where I hope to\
  \ attend my first game of World Cup 2014.\nAs the boat moves away from the pier,\
  \ I\u2019m glad I arrived earlier than most and was able to set up camp on the middle\
  \ deck; down below, the sleeping arrangements are closer to the intestines of the\
  \ vessel and all their attendant noise, heat and smells. Here the breeze wafts freely,\
  \ the light filters clearly, the odors of river and jungle replace those of fuel\
  \ and labor. Mosquitoes are surprisingly absent; perhaps the motion of the boat\
  \ makes us too much like hard work. Rolling stones are harder to get blood out of\
  \ than stationary ones, apparently.\nThe open-air top deck hosts a sun-lounging\
  \ platform, a modest bar, and, most importantly, a 25-inch TV screen and satellite\
  \ dish. I am pleasantly shocked to learn that somehow \u2013 here, in quite literally\
  \ the middle of nowhere \u2013 we can get a signal and as a result, will avoid missing\
  \ the first game of the tournament, Brazil v Croatia. I should hardly be surprised;\
  \ after all, missing such a sporting occasion would be unthinkable in Brazil, even\
  \ if the miracle of its screening was the last thing I expected. More fool me.\n\
  Finally, the final day of the voyage arrives and with it the World Cup of World\
  \ Cups. The festival atmosphere that has been building steadily comes to a head\
  \ and by the start of the match, the bar has run dry. In the event, the heavily\
  \ partisan crowd is appeased by a satisfactory (if unconvincing) 3-1 win for the\
  \ hosts, and before I know it, the game is over, the day too, and the night gives\
  \ way to the inevitable hangover as we draw up in Manaus harbor.\nBefore the journey,\
  \ three days sounded like a long time to be marooned on a boat. However, Amazon\
  \ life is surprisingly addictive; there are worse ways to while away time than reclining\
  \ in a hammock and being lulled into lethargy. But though I have thoroughly enjoyed\
  \ my time on the boat, there is the city of Manaus to visit\u2026 and some sort\
  \ of football tournament to concern myself with."
