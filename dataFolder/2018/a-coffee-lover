Text: "From the rural villages to the paddy fields and from the paddy fields to the\
  \ most northern part of Thailand, I decided to spend my wonderful afternoon time\
  \ for a tasty coffee at the Golden Triangle where I can see the historic and colorful\
  \ Mekong River that flows from  the southern part of China and makes the frontiers\
  \ and limits of Thailand, Myanmar and Laos. Many people come to shopping here and\
  \ some of them come to visit a duty free on the island of Don Sao that belongs to\
  \ Laos by a long-tail speed boat. But as I mentioned previously, I would sit down\
  \ with a nice coffee in an excellent place, so I might do this boat trip later.\
  \ \n      From where I parked my car, I could smell something like a perfume. Yes,\
  \ it\u2019s aromatic and drinkable. Suddenly I remember that the smell of coffee\
  \ is calling me\u2026  \n      As a good lover of coffee, I went to sit down on\
  \ a unique bamboo chair in a simple bar with a spectacular chill-out terrace and\
  \ an extraordinary opera concert of crickets in order to drink one good coffee and\
  \ to clean my mouth with a great poem until the beautiful yellowish-orange sky and\
  \ the water surface illuminated by the sunset were gone. I know that the moon and\
  \ the stars will come to shine in the darkness of the night sky afterwards, but\
  \ I don\u2019t think  I will see them before flying home, because I planed to dine\
  \ out with friends in a street restaurant and eating a padthai that will come with\
  \ stir fried noodles, tamarind sauce, fish sauce, ground peanuts, soya bean shoots,\
  \ spring garlic, tofu and shrimps. So my day is quite full.\n      The coffee shop\
  \ where I\u2019ve been sitting and drinking my coffee is a simple hut built of mud\
  \ and emerald green bamboo with a large terrace that offers stunning views over\
  \ the Golden Triangle. It\u2019s not crowded. It\u2019s very recommended to come\
  \ here...\n      While listening to the grinder grinding roasted coffee beans, my\
  \ eyes can't stop looking at one board which says, \u201CWe just use the finest\
  \ Arabica coffee beans selected from our organic coffee farms to create the quintessential\
  \ flavor for our clients\u201D. And after reading this wonderful sentence, I feel\
  \ very pround of the coffee quality what they intend to offer to me. For this reason,\
  \ I can't either forget to ask them where those coffee farms can be found. They\
  \ said It would take about one hour and a half to get there by car. It\u2019s openned\
  \ to the public everyday... Yes, after this conversation, I may have to make another\
  \ trip to come visit this new landscape next time."
