Text: "\u201EHey, what are you up to, you \u2026\"\nI've never sworn in my life, but\
  \ since Iran, I am foul-mouthed while driving.\nAm I under stress?\nBloody hell\
  \ I am, and I boil my tension out shouting through the window.\nA rickshaw blocks\
  \ the pocket in front of me. I have less than a second to hit the breaks.\n\"Who\
  \ gives driving licenses to these bastards?\"\nI step on the accelerator and make\
  \ a frantic maneuver treading a hectic against traffic, to overtake a decorated\
  \ with dangling metal trinkets truck, glittering with animals, flowers, shapes,\
  \ faces, painted or assembled with pieces reflecting tape, masterfully arranged\
  \ on the bodywork. Horns honk. The road we drive on is flooded with vehicles, on\
  \ my left string donkey carts and cyclists.\n\nI am a legend, a diminishing shadow,\
  \ after just 38 years of service. My kind is dilapidated.\nI was losing all grounds,\
  \ before I met them, the boy and the girl. He took me, unwillingly he was a step\
  \ of destroying me until he started to repair me.\n\"Let the scrap rot.\"\nI've\
  \ heard it many times, but he believed in me and I survived. And despite my age,\
  \ I still live. I move.\nMy name is Opel Rekord, I never claimed of breaking any\
  \ records, but now I am in Karachi, on board he and she and their unborn child safely\
  \ tucked into the mother's womb, en route to India. What a dream they've got, to\
  \ have their child be born in India, and to trust me to take them there.\n\nA minute\
  \ ago we had an escort. A military vehicle accompanied us until we've crossed the\
  \ invisible line splitting Baluchistan and Sindh, in a busy Karachi neighborhood.\
  \ Now we are left on our own, and the traffic once pushed away by the escort now\
  \ rubs our bumpers.\n\"I love it, look, the color, the shape, the condition, the\
  \ age, the style of driving, it is craziness, just to imagine us in the whirlpool\
  \ of Karachi\". - I grin excitedly to my wife. Horns are honking.\n\"It was better\
  \ with the military support\" - she flashes back at me - \"I am much more relaxed\
  \ to know someone cares about our wellbeing.\"\n\"Please take a video - us driving\
  \ in Karachi. I can't do when driving.\"\n\"I can't either. I am too busy guiding\
  \ you, don't you see, it is like not you but I drive.\"\n\nThese two fellas are\
  \ such optimists. We've crossed grassy fields, deserts and mountain passes, and\
  \ we keep on going. My pistons hum in unison with the tiny voice of their newborn\
  \ Samira.\nMy name is Rekord, but I do not chase records, I am happy that my engine\
  \ runs smooth, and I will go over any extend to bring these three back home."
