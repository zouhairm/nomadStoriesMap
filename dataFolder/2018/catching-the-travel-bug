Text: "It was the summer of 2012, my mother had invited me to join her for a women\u2019\
  s conference in Torino, Italy. There was no second thinking my decision to go. I\
  \ had never been to Europe and wanted so desperately to have an adventure. It was\
  \ at a point in my life where it seemed less than exciting. I had been out of college\
  \ 2 years and working a job I didn\u2019t love. After all, you regret the chances\
  \ you don\u2019t take, not the ones you do. So without further hesitation, only\
  \ excitement, I packed my bags for my first taste of true travel and culture. \n\
  \ Upon our arrival, all I could think about was getting out and exploring. There\
  \ were just feelings of wonder and elation pumping through my veins. However, my\
  \ jet lag had gotten the best of me and upon entry into the hotel room, I collapsed\
  \ on the bed. There wasn\u2019t any worry though, we were staying 10 days and in\
  \ that time I would explore. That is the one thing about traveling to a far away\
  \ land, the jet lag. It is the worst part of any adventure, your brain can\u2019\
  t keep up with your body. \n After catching up on some well needed sleep, I got\
  \ up and ventured out of the hotel. At first I just explored my surroundings without\
  \ need or want for a map. This is the best way to discover a new place. I came across\
  \ a little cafe, where I sipped the best cappuccino. When the froth from the top\
  \ of it touched my lips, I instantly thought I was living \u201CLa Dolce Vita.\u201D\
  \ What was once a dream, was now a reality. I was sipping an authentic coffee beverage\
  \ in the place that had made it famous. While at the cafe I tried my best to learn\
  \ some Italian, but found it difficult to pickup.\n There was a want to fully immerse\
  \ myself in everything Italian, from cuisine to culture. As I walked the cobbled\
  \ stone streets, all I could think about was the rich history of it all. Throughout\
  \ my stay, everyday was a new place and a new discovery. I managed to learn how\
  \ the train system worked and escaped to Milan a few times. Besides the few gypsies\
  \ I passed before making the climb up, there was so much beauty to be seen. Each\
  \ motion up the stairs my heart raced as the picture of Duomo (the cathedral) enlarged.\
  \ Then before I knew it I was standing mid center in this magical living painting.\
  \ The scale of the cathedral was unlike any church or other place of worship I had\
  \ ever been to. The whole image of the square and this huge glorious building shook\
  \ me."
