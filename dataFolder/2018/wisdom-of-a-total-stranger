Text: "After 4 hours of the soothing lull of slicing water, the ferry is approaching\
  \ Wellington in the distance through the foggy mist. It had been adventurous 2 weeks\
  \ in the South Island of New Zealand, driving solo weaving through the island from\
  \ the earthquake-struck Christchurch to the sublime Tasman Bay while crashing with\
  \ locals as varied as a young and idealistic construction apprentice, lonely life-long\
  \ farm help, bubbly South African pizza chef living in Queenstown, and a bunch of\
  \ dare-devil rock-climbers who successfully egged me to try climbing a local cliff\
  \ barefoot. \n\nI don't know what got me the crazy idea to travel the country entirely\
  \ dependent on the generosity of the locals. I had a strange faith it will work\
  \ out. Well, for the first time in my life, I caught fish the size of my arm, rode\
  \ a quad bike to help chase a bull move to the right side of the pasture, waded\
  \ my way into twenty-some young calves to feed them milk while feeling strangly\
  \ like a Mary Poppins in the midst of it, chased black swans in Lake Wanaka, and\
  \ rode a cheaply rented 4*4 deep into a beaten road to a place called Paradise,\
  \ with a wooden sign that read Paradise, through a 2 hour coastal drive off of Queesntown\
  \ that looks like a road to Paradise.\n\nBut today isn't all roses and bubbles.\
  \ My fiance broke off the engagement over the phone the night before. I cried so\
  \ much I had to pull to the side of the road so as not to crash the car. As I'm\
  \ walking into the first hole in the wall bar I could find in the city, all I want\
  \ is to numb the broken heart with a gulp of red wine. As I'm downing the wine,\
  \ I'm intrigued by Asad, a Wellington community college security guard originally\
  \ from Somali, who just got the license for whitewater rafting instruction. He has\
  \ a shy demeanor, quiet voice, and sparkling eyes. He tells me about how happy his\
  \ life is at Wellington after his family escaped the genocide in Somalia. Casually\
  \ he tells me how he was burned alive when he was 4 years old. He stopped breathing\
  \ and people had left him with the dead bodies for 3 days. He tells me all this\
  \ with a smile.\n\nI always thought I travel so that I can see how differently people\
  \ love, live, and relate, yet so the same. Now I know I travel to know myself. The\
  \ best of myself reflected back in the lives of others who I meet along the way.\
  \ Even in the darkest days. I walk way from the bar with a warm wine glow and a\
  \ quiet confidence life is, in fact, good and well. And grateful for the wisdom\
  \ of a stranger."
