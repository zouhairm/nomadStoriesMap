Text: "March 2014\n\nInternational Conferences don\u2019t happen regularly in our\
  \ country, so you can be sure that the moment one was announced in Delhi, students\
  \ grabbed that opportunity with both hands.\nWe were no different, and excitedly\
  \ gabbed away about the excitement that was coming our way.\n\nThe plan was to stay\
  \ at a friend\u2019s place- but sadly, her mother took ill and we decided it was\
  \ best if we didn\u2019t pose an additional burden to the family.\nAs a group of\
  \ four, we decided to stay in one of the hotels approved by the local committee-\
  \ since the to and fro travel (and dinner) was included.\nThe decision didn\u2019\
  t satisfy my mother, however, and she warned me against it- but being the brash\
  \ young gun that I was, I told her she was worrying unnecessarily and that we would\
  \ be fine.\n\nOne of our group dropped out before the trip, but we weren\u2019t\
  \ too fazed- after all, three\u2019s still a crowd!\n\nWe took a flight that landed\
  \ at rush hour- but soon realised a flaw in our plans, as no cabs were available!\
  \ After much waiting, we got one, and were on our way to the location.\n\nHowever,\
  \ one hour turned into two, and was slowly going to three- and there was no sign\
  \ of any hotel.\nOur anxiety grew as the sky turned inkier, and our cab driver stopping\
  \ to ask for directions didn\u2019t help much to alleviate it.\n\nThe location turned\
  \ out to be on the Delhi-Ghaziabad highway- surrounded by barren land miles on end.\
  \ Being students, we didn\u2019t mind budget hotels- but this one seemed to still\
  \ be under construction, complete with a dirt road approach!\nAnd though we had\
  \ reached our destination, we relaxed only when we saw other delegates out and about.\n\
  \nWe thanked our driver profusely and proceeded to complete the formalities before\
  \ being escorted to our rooms- glad that it was only a small glitch in the trip.\n\
  \nThe last thing I expected was a threadbare room, and moreover, no inner latch\
  \ to lock the door.\nWe asked the manager to switch our rooms, but he flat out refused-\
  \ the rooms that were usable were all occupied.\n\nWe ended up barricading the door\
  \ with the desk- and took turns keeping watch through the night.\n\nThe next morning,\
  \ we vacated the room and shifted to another guest house- and the sleep I had that\
  \ night was one of the best to date (in my rather short life).\n\nLessons learnt-\
  \ trips can (or should) have an element of spontaneity, but its best not to be as\
  \ clueless as the younger me was. Do your research before going, and lastly- listen\
  \ to your mom!"
