Text: "\" Sun\u2019s gonna shine on Clarkesdale\u2019s door someday\"\n\nFrom where\
  \ I sit the sky hangs like a lead coffin lid - it\u2019s the rainy season in Mississippi.\
  \ Out in the far distance I can just see the edge of the huge concrete flyover that\
  \ bypasses this almost forgotten spot in America\u2019s history. From the share\
  \ croppers hut I\u2019m staying in the bleak landscape of cotton fields and bent\
  \ telegraph poles follows the long straggling road that is Highway 61. I\u2019m\
  \ here on a \u201CBlues\u201D pilgrimage with my old friend, Ray.\n We grew up gazing\
  \ through a camera lens that showed us a distant planet, a place where cars were\
  \ ostentatiously big and a man called Chuck Berry irrevocably changed the face of\
  \ popular music. They say that the blues gave birth to a baby and that baby was\
  \ \u2018Rock n\u2019 Roll\u2019 so that\u2019s why we\u2019re here. We want to find\
  \ out where the gestation began and it\u2019s the last thing I expected.\n For pilgrims\
  \ like us we are at the apex of the blues, Clarkesdale, Mississippi.  John Lee Hooker,\
  \ Sam Cooke, Ike Turner, they were all born here but you\u2019d never know it. Enter\
  \ the town and it\u2019s a wasteland of empty shops, rusting old gas stations and\
  \ abandoned movie houses. If this town were a dog we\u2019d probably shoot it.\n\
  The few people on the largely empty streets we\u2019re patrolling have never heard\
  \ of the Blues Museum we\u2019re looking for. They\u2019re mainly black but seem\
  \ to know nothing of this town\u2019s history.\n And then we find it in the town\u2019\
  s old rail building. In contrast to the rain-drenched streets outside it immediately\
  \ lifts the spirits. Superb cases of memorabilia surround us and a section\u2019\
  s dedicated to Muddy Waters. Eric Clapton and Paul Simon feature in the visitor\u2019\
  s book. \n Outside \u2018Chilly Billy\u2019 an avuncular bear of a man shouts \u201C\
  where you good ol\u2019 boys from?\u201D and tells us \u201Cyou all get yourselves\
  \ to Red\u2019s Juke joint tonight \u2018cause man it\u2019s cookin\u2019 there.\n\
  \ Red\u2019s is packed and the band is hot so it\u2019s the early hours of the morning\
  \ before we get back at the \u2018Shack Up Inn\u2019, an old 1920\u2019s share cropper\u2019\
  s cabin surrounded by waterlogged fields. The place drips with atmosphere. I sit\
  \ alone on the back porch with a beer. Bullfrogs croak. \nI reflect on Clarkesdale\
  \ and that old line \u201C Woke up this mornin\u2019 \u201D comes into my head.\
  \ I realise the town is like the music it reflects. It carries a little melancholy\
  \ in its streets that suits the place.\nTomorrow the sky will be low and grey again,\
  \ it\u2019s the rainy season in Mississipi"
