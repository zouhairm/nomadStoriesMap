Text: "\u201CYou may have a friend, but if something goes wrong even the police won\u2019\
  t interfere with their affairs. You are going in blind, it\u2019s not exactly safe\u201D\
  , warned my friends. I made a local connection with MadiVaanan, a Sri Lankan refugee\
  \ who lives in a tribal settlement for the islanders. The government of India allowed\
  \ them to settle down and form a community when civil war was tearing their world\
  \ apart. \n\nI knew it was risky, but that was a once in a lifetime opportunity,\
  \ a chance to enter the forbidden land, one that was not advertised on any tourist\
  \ sites. MadiVaanan, his name means the beautiful sky on a full moon night, was\
  \ a happy soul and since I did not form any pre conceived notions about them, we\
  \ made an instant connection. I wondered why people are so afraid, people around\
  \ the world are generally good, simple and happy. They may be a little scared about\
  \ the things they don\u2019t know or understand, but a smile would always be rewarded\
  \ back with a smile, or so I hoped. \n\nI really wanted to meet them. Even after\
  \ three decades, they were outsiders. MadiVaanan\u2019s parents were born in the\
  \ emerald islands, but he was born in India. I understood that he was struggling\
  \ with the thought that he neither belonged to India nor was he a Sri Lankan. But\
  \ for me it doesn\u2019t matter, he was a very happy soul, who was just happy to\
  \ make friends, so one who wanted people to see him as a human and not a representation\
  \ of any community. \n\n\u201CIs your food different\u201D, I asked him.\n\n\u201C\
  You can\u2019t take the thought of food away for a second, can you? Also you don\u2019\
  t look big for a man who loves food so madly\u201D Madi was in a jovial mood. May\
  \ be he was excited that someone is not judgemental about them and want to be friends.\n\
  \n\u201CI eat to savour the moment, not finish off the entire supply\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Yes, our cuisine is a little different. My mom and granny still follow the traditional\
  \ cooking style that they packed with them when they flee from the war\u201D I was\
  \ hooked, I was sure that I am in for an eye opening experience and my stories would\
  \ help people lose the fear about the aliens living inside the rain forests of Kerala.\n\
  \nWe decided to walk and not take his motorcycle to reach the settlement that was\
  \ 23 kilometres inside the forest. He knew some shortcuts and we walked for five\
  \ and a half hours. I still remember the look on the forest guard, who scorned at\
  \ me when we were entering the range. What he meant to say was that I will be lucky\
  \ to come back in a piece. I wanted to prove them wrong."
