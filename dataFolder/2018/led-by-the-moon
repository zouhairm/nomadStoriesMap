Text: "At the top of mountains, I can always see life\u2019s bigger picture better\
  \ than from the valley floor. There\u2019s some magic that happens when I fight\
  \ my way to the summit and gaze back down from whence I came.\n\nMt. Timpanogos\
  \ was the mountain of our choice. It\u2019s been known for its unmatchable view\
  \ of the city far below. We arrived at the trailhead just as the dashboard clock\
  \ showed midnight and began what would be a 10 hour, unforgettable adventure. We\
  \ had gotten so fed up with movie nights and make out sessions that we decided to\
  \ do something different; hike in the moon light. Our spontaneous timing was perfect,\
  \ for the moon appeared bigger and brighter than ever before. \n\nThe outdoors welcomed\
  \ us. It was as if nature wanted us to be there to enjoy her beauty. There were\
  \ times when our jovial singing would echo through the mountain range, as if the\
  \ land was singing back to us. The Moon bid us to follow him as he quietly drifted\
  \ across the sky, guiding us towards the top of this remarkable mountain. For us,\
  \ it was a chance to get away and breathe new air, a chance to reflect and be changed\
  \ by the experience we were creating. Or perhaps it was creating us.\n\nThe journey\
  \ to the top wasn't difficult until the last few miles when the path became just\
  \ shy of straight up, or so if felt. We found ourselves having lost the ability\
  \ to breathe normal for we weren\u2019t in the least bit prepared. After many rest\
  \ stops and pep talks, we reached the summit. It was just as the moon ducked out\
  \ of view and the sun was about to presents himself. No picture could do justice\
  \ to what our naked eyes saw as dawn broke. The rising sun made the horizon burn\
  \ like a raging fire while the valley floor was still speckled with street lights,\
  \ one by one flickering off.\n\nAs I felt the warmth of the sun hit my face, something\
  \ happened. I felt the stress and the burden of daily life be carried away with\
  \ the breeze. The weight of everyone\u2019s expectations and opinions vanished and\
  \ all that was left was me. The real me, the one I was born to be but had become\
  \ lost in all the chaos that comes from life. I found more of myself 11,000 feet\
  \ above sea level, and I wasn\u2019t the only one, those who were with me expressed\
  \ a similar discovery.\n\nWhen I suggested the hike and persuaded others to join\
  \ me, the last thing I expected was for it to change the way I look at life and\
  \ myself. But that\u2019s what happens on mountain tops. At the summit of Mt. Timpanogos\
  \ next to the metal shack is a special place for us."
