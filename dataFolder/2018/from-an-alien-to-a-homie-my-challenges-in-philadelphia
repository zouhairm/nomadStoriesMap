Text: "There is an old saying in the East that if you want to know better a foreign\
  \ city, go to their bazaars. Since bazaar is the place where the locals go, the\
  \ maxim intends to emphasize the significance making local connections. Nowadays\
  \ with so many means of media and technology, it is possible to get information\
  \ about any destination before actually going there. However the coin has two sides\
  \ and it is the locals that can let us know the other side.\nWhen I came to the\
  \ USA on a fellowship program, I was placed in Philadelphia. I did not settle at\
  \ the campus on purpose, and rented a room in the neighborhood where mostly African-American\
  \ community lives. Initially, I had my own challenges to get on with the people\
  \ in the area. On my first day when I moved in I felt myself like in the American\
  \ movies about the \u201Chood boys\u201D; the hips hop songs playing loudly, people\
  \ dancing outside energetically on hot weekend afternoons and barbeque apparatus\
  \ almost in every yard. I got excited and wanted to interact with the locals, but\
  \ when I did, I felt myself speaking in an alien language. With my significant achievements\
  \ in English language, I thought I knew English fluently, but here the communication\
  \ is more like a Rapping. People had no idea what I was talking about. I grew up\
  \ listening and enjoying rap and hip-hop music, but it had never occurred to me\
  \ that people might speak likewise. \nSince every effort is rewarded eventually;\
  \ I was able to be friends with the residents and to develop excellent American\
  \ accent skills. It was just a matter of time, and now people love to share with\
  \ me their thoughts, and at the same time to know more about my country. One thing\
  \ that still frustrates me though is my name. I did not want to choose any Christian\
  \ name to be called by, and told them my real name, Furkat. Later I realized it\
  \ was a bad idea. Now some of them call me by the name of \u201CFalcon\u201D or\
  \ \u201CFork\u201D which makes me laugh all the time. Recently, I asked some of\
  \ them to call me Stan, because I am from UzbekiStan and all the countries in Central\
  \ Asia are known as \u201CStans\u201D.  Despite the fact most of them still know\
  \ me by the former variants, it does not bother me. Because every time I go to local\
  \ house party I am introduced to the \u201Chomies\u201D as a type of bird or kitchen\
  \ utensil, I am at the center of their attention. They like to know about me, whereas\
  \ I love picking their brains. I have succeeded to become their \u201CMan\u201D."
