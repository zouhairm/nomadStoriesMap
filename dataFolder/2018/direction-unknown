Text: "Well overstaying the 2-day plan in Barcelona I realised it had already been\
  \ 10 days of beer, tapas, music; and breathtaking monuments. It was time I continue\
  \ the journey. As a solo traveller I would flow whichever pathway opened up. My\
  \ newly made friends Federica and Beatrice were living in Milan and offered to show\
  \ me around their city for a few days. This was perfect! I booked my flights for\
  \ the 16th of September. It was the 14th so I had a few more days to explore Barcelona.\
  \ Bing: up pops a confirmation email on my phone \u201CFlights Confirmed\". I click\
  \ on the link and realize in that moment I messed up\u2026Flights confirmed for\
  \ the 26th of September. I contemplate my options and two were worthy of consideration:\
  \ 1. Change the date, 2. Explore Spain and then make my way back to Barcelona in\
  \ 10 days.\n\nOption 2 confirmed, it was time to head south. I caught a train to\
  \ Valencia with Granada on the horizon. As I arrived in Valencia I signed onto Couchsurfing.org\
  \ to check out any events in the city, always such a wonderful way to submerge into\
  \ the city. I found an event run by a Spanish language school, it sounded great.\
  \ It was like a social drinking night held on campus with drinking games as the\
  \ incentive to learn. Granada was next on the cards.\nTravellers\u2019 tales and\
  \ murmurs around Granada told that the caves were inhibited by people. I didn\u2019\
  t know what to expect. I decided to give in to curiosity trekked towards the sierra.\
  \ Taking directions from people I passed by; I was invited into the first cave I\
  \ stumbled upon. This was a glamourous cave of which inhibiters had carved their\
  \ own real-estate. This was brilliant, solar energy, dome like caverns with bright\
  \ white walls, natural sunlight & chandeliers, even flat screen TVs and pumping\
  \ audio systems, well blowing my preconceived imagination of what living in a cave\
  \ would be like. I stepped out onto the deck and listening to some locals playing\
  \ flamenco guitar until the sun sunk beyond the bold mountains and soaked the sky\
  \ red.\n\nAt this stage I was content with missing the flight, I was to continue\
  \ south to Seville and then Tarifa. To me Tarifa was a major crossroad I was gazing\
  \ out onto the horizon and realised Africa was clearly visible. Within 6 hours I\
  \ had booked my ferry with the correct date. I may have missed my flight to Italy\
  \ but I surely wasn't going to miss my boat to Morocco. I stepped aboard with many\
  \ locals and some cargo including fruits, spices and a few goats. Solo travelling\
  \ is all about flow."
