Text: "Zhenia bought a used Nissan, dubbed Sven. I was to be navigator for the inaugural\
  \ adventure.\n \nWe had been roommates during tour leader training in Guatemala.\
  \ Eventually, Zhenia abandoned transient life. I remained faithful. Still, the bond\
  \ born of uncertainty in a new land remained.\n \nOn the road, we were reminded\
  \ why Guatemala is the \"Cradle of the Maya Civilization.\"  Shimmering beads of\
  \  Guipiles splatter every meter of every city block. \n \nAmid the chaos are woven\
  \ thousands of years of tradition. Take Guipiles, the Maya blouse and skirt. Maya\
  \ women sacrifice time and money to sow their own. A Guipil represents its owner.\
  \ Blue, yellow, red and white, the four colors of corn. The Maya are the people\
  \ of corn.  Every thread of Maya culture has its place.\n \nWe arrived in Huehuetenango,\
  \ three hours away. We ate in the public market \u2014 white beans with rice and\
  \ chicken.  Sharing a tiny table with a cowboy we learned of the Diego Olaverri\
  \ Viewpoint. \u201CYou'd better go now, if you're going to go\" he warned.\n \n\
  Guatemala is not the place to drive at night. Robberies are common, and emergency\
  \ services are not. But this was a test, after all. We arrived as the sun faded.\
  \ The view from over 3,000m was breathtaking. \n \nWe crossed paths with Domingo,\
  \ a shepherd. He was impossibly old for a working man, dressed in fading, colorful,\
  \ pants and cowboy hat. He told us he spoke Mam, one of over 20 Maya languages,\
  \ and was from Todos Santos. Todos Santos is famous for its Mam traditions and an\
  \ annual drunken horse race.\n \n\u201CHow far is Todos Santos?\u201D\n \n\u201C\
  One hour,\u201D said Domingo, indicating \"one\" with a gnarled index finger and\
  \ warm smile that contrasted sharply with a totally white eye.\n \nWe took to the\
  \ road in haste, passing villages where burros were as plentiful as cars. The route\
  \ abruptly plunged. We looked down an endless valley whose walls gradually dropped\
  \ into a sea of fog. The speed limit dipped to 30km. Signs warned to \"think about\
  \ family, break with motor.\" Houses hung precariously from the shoulder. Schools,\
  \ shops and football fields were crammed into minute spaces. An existence on the\
  \ edge, literally. \n\nOut of the brume appeared a house, a woman kneeling outside,\
  \ weaving at a waist loom. The ancient Maya artifact for crafting Guipiles. She\
  \ welcomed us with a glance, without missing a loop in the weave. A thousand years\
  \ faded away, her fingers moving with the skill of a hundred generations and billions\
  \ of painstakingly perfect movements repeated over millennia."
