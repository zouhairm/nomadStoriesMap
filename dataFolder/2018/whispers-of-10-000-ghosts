Text: "It was silent. No birds. Not even the expectant murmur of a crowd trying to\
  \ keep quiet. It was like a blanket had been thrown over the entire area preventing\
  \ any noise escaping. I realised at this point my camera was unnecessary; I knew\
  \ I would never forget this place.\n\nThe trees lining the perimeter were dead.\
  \ There was little to no grass and what was there, was struggling for life. Despite\
  \ the fresh air and open fields surrounding the buildings, it was clearly a 'death\
  \ camp' in every sense of the word. Life could not thrive here. \n\nThe corridor\
  \ was full of faces. They covered every inch of the walls, some with names and dates,\
  \ many with little or no detail. All of them stared at me with empty eyes and sallow\
  \ skin. Like they had died long before the photos were taken. My skin erupted into\
  \ goose bumps and my camera hung from my neck like a ten-tonne weight. \n\nShoes;\
  \ men's, women's and children's. One pair caught my eye, I had put a similar style\
  \ on the tiny feet of my two-year-old niece just weeks earlier. My heart caught\
  \ in my chest. It was with a growing sense of despair I realised I had been excited\
  \ to visit this place.\n\nHuman hair doesn't look the same when it's not attached\
  \ to the living. My body shook as my eyes fell on the braids pressed against the\
  \ glass, still adorned with ribbons but devoid of any shine, I tried not to picture\
  \ the little girl who once wore them.\n\nSpectacles - mangled, twisted and broken.\
  \ The space they occupied was tiny compared to the impact they made on me. I couldn't\
  \ help but liken them to the souls they were taken from. It crossed my mind that\
  \ they had probably been mangled, twisted and broken too.\n\nThey looked as innocent\
  \ as paint tins. Countless cans of 'Cyclon B', the evil brainchild of the Nazis.\
  \ Their weapon of mass destruction didn't need to explode to cause devastation.\
  \ \n\nThe gas chamber. I stood in the room of 10,000 ghosts. My heart raced. I glanced\
  \ around and my eyes came to rest on the walls, each one covered in scratch marks.\
  \ Tears poured silently from me like water spilling from a glass. The cold didn't\
  \ bother me anymore, it was the stale air, gas lines and nail gouges that drove\
  \ me from the room. I ran.  \n\nI flashed back to the morning, I felt 1000 years\
  \ wiser than I did getting onto that bus. This was not a museum, it was a piece\
  \ of history preserved beyond comprehension. Exhausted, I placed my redundant camera\
  \ back in my bag and rested my head on the seat as silence filled my ears. I had\
  \ been excited for this."
