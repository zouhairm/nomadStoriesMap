Text: "I relapsed again. I couldn't afford a therapist so the internet was my best\
  \ friend. In the past few weeks I gathered from the internet that I might be suffering\
  \ from depression with a dose of anxiety and the occasional panic attacks. The panic\
  \ attacks occurred anytime I thought of my father and how he was doing, Alzheimer's\
  \ and all. He was bed ridden the last time I saw him. I knew I needed help, but\
  \ the one person who could calm me down was my father, and he could barely talk.\
  \ So I searched and looked and I found something, a solution that has been there\
  \ all along. A hobby I set aside because of my 9-5. Traveling. Maybe that's all\
  \ I needed to improve my mental health. So without a thought, and with little money\
  \ in my pocket, I decided to just go. To leave this toxic place called work. This\
  \ place that has done so well to shut me out from the real world outside.\n\nI called\
  \ up my friend and he didn't even think twice. The next day we were going to ghost\
  \ on everyone, and journey to the magical Aburi Gardens hidden in  the Aburi mountains.\
  \ The journey via public transport was an experience I missed and it made it all\
  \ the more worth it. We made it just in time to the gardens to see the sun rise\
  \ above the trees. The expanse of green gave me this surge of sudden peace, and\
  \ I knew I was on a road to recovery, no matter how slow it was. My boss had not\
  \ called me yet so I knew I haven't been missed at the office. Not just yet. \n\n\
  This garden was born out of a vision of Ghana's first president Dr. Kwame Nkrumah,\
  \ so It's no secret how old these trees are. My friend and I settled in an uncompleted\
  \ building overtaken by fungi, to observe nature. The hunger pangs set in, and we\
  \ decided to ask around for a near by bar with cheaper food because the food in\
  \ the garden restaurants  were very expensive. We craved something local, something\
  \ Ghanaian. We were directed to a bar. My friend being a film enthusiast tried to\
  \ film the whole experience from buying the food to we eating it, on his phone.\
  \ Unfortunately for us the owner of the bar saw this and felt threatened. You see,\
  \ the locals in these parts come across as a bit closed minded when it comes to\
  \ social media and the camera in general. So he tried to engage my friend in a threatening\
  \ discourse which almost turned into a fight. I tried to end it all, by asking my\
  \ friend to delete the videos, and with that we ate our food and left the establishment.\
  \ I went on a journey to find peace, not create war. Still, it was a good day."
