Text: "Walking the streets of Marrakech is what I would expect Aladdin feels like\
  \ walking through Agrabah - it\u2019s magical! It was a treat to get lost in the\
  \ labyrinth of the souks - with all the beautifully hand-crafted leather, patterned\
  \ carpets, brightly painted ceramics, decorated tin lamps, and spices galore! What\u2019\
  s not to love?!\n\nIn the more quiet part of the market, I stumbled upon a beautifully\
  \ crafted leather briefcase and was also lucky enough to meet the creator who was\
  \ sitting inside his souk, working diligently on his next leather creation. Immediately\
  \ I knew he was different from the other salesmen - he had a stand-off approach\
  \ that allowed me to look at his bags without being so persistent for me to make\
  \ a purchase. It was a breath of fresh air. His name is Arib.\n\nArib is a shop\
  \ owner, leather worker, husband and father. He takes quiet pride in the work he\
  \ creates and puts all of his energy and love into his craft. I was moved not only\
  \ by his obvious talents but also his gentle demeanor. I found myself captivated\
  \ by him - I was lucky enough that he felt the same! We shared a conversation over\
  \ the custom mint tea that was filled with small talk and easy conversation. \n\n\
  As the days moved forward, I stopped by each day and had a kettle of mint tea with\
  \ him. I met his son, Jubair, who taught me how to make a leather bracelet out of\
  \ the scraps of leather his father discarded. Bracelets aside, Arib and I were able\
  \ to ask each other questions of religion and beliefs. We both found a trust and\
  \ bond between us that was forged by openness and curiosity. He has a wife that\
  \ has birthed six of his children, but in all honesty, he had no idea how many children\
  \ he actually has. He spoke of his wife lovingly though not having to be faithful\
  \ to her was natural.\n\nA connection formed between us within those days. The openness\
  \ to sharing stories and way of life was a gift. Arib and I come from two very different\
  \ worlds, with a different set of beliefs, which could very well be a recipe for\
  \ disaster. Curiosity, respect and understanding allowed us both to step into a\
  \ space together and truly get to know each other. We got to ask the \u201Cwhys\u201D\
  \ and \u201Chows\u201D of our cultures and lifestyles. We gave ourselves the opportunity\
  \ to really learn and understand the differences between us and in turn, led us\
  \ to valuable similarities. The love of the earth, craft and family are all the\
  \ same."
