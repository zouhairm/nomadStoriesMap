Text: "Confusion and anxiety hit my head the moment I landed at Heathrow International\
  \ Airport. This is my first trip with Contiki tour, which is a high energy tour\
  \ for young people. The moment I know that the tour is in such a big group, approximately\
  \ 40-50 people, I start to doubt if I should even be here. I consider myself as\
  \ an introvert; making friends is not something I am good at. \n\nOn day one of\
  \ the tour, our tour guide starts with network interaction to get us mingled better\
  \ for the next couple weeks. I get extremely uncomfortable by introducing myself,\
  \ swapping seats and talking to strangers during the bus ride. After couple days,\
  \ I find myself a few travel buddies in the group. We tend to stick around for dinner\
  \ and exploration in different cities. \n\nEvery night after dinners, we hang around\
  \ at the hotel bar to drink and socialize. SOCIAL! It is something I never thought\
  \ of myself doing it during my solo trip to Europe. In fact, the word \u201CSOCIAL\u201D\
  \ haunted me a lot prior to the tour. Look at me now; I am actually enjoying it,\
  \ like everyone else. \n\nDuring the tour, we depart from London to Paris with other\
  \ places that we visit in between these locations, I see so much about the world.\
  \ I get to learn that I am particularly interested in beautiful landscape. One that\
  \ attracts me so much is in Lucerne, Austria. I enjoy taking photos of the magnificent\
  \ landscape, but I always have difficulty taking landscape pictures of myself in\
  \ it. The good news is I have a bunch of new met friends. We start to take each\
  \ other photos and we take photos together too. \n\nTime pass like lightning, two\
  \ weeks tour just ends in a blink of an eye. On the very last day of the tour, I\
  \ realise how much I will miss these people that I have just met in such a short\
  \ time. I realise how much our friendship can develop in such a limited time. I\
  \ am amazed at myself and the people that I have met in this group. The trip has\
  \ not only bring me to see the world and to enhance my knowledge, but also to open\
  \ up my heart to try something I never want to do, which is to meet friends. The\
  \ last thing I have never expected from this trip is the lifelong FRIENDSHIP."
