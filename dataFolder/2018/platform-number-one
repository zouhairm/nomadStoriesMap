Text: "In front of me was a big, but almost empty rickshaw stand. Drivers were sleeping\
  \ covering their faces with towels in their vehicles. It was almost midday. Maps\
  \ showed the distance to be 50 miles. If hired a rickshaw, I would reach Kutch before\
  \ sunset. But as I hadn\u2019t registered for a tent there, I would have to return\
  \ that night only, and that\u2019s the real issue*.* Already conscious seeing the\
  \ new place and now traveling alone further in a rickshaw and that too in night,\
  \ I couldn't convince myself. However, returning without visiting the desert would\
  \ have been a lifelong regret. \n*Getting ditched by two friends at the last moment,\
  \ I was on my way to the Great Rann of Kutch to witness Ranotsav, a desert festival.\
  \ My first solo trip ever, that too, unplanned. **I had got to know that there are\
  \ no buses for the desert from Bhuj, the nearest railway station.*\n**And so, there\
  \ I was, sitting all alone, clueless on the stairs of Bhuj platform number one and\
  \ deciding what to do next.** \n**Finally, I decided to take chance and go for the\
  \ desert. I was not ready for the regret.**\nI hired a rickshaw and started for\
  \ something which now seems a memory of a lifetime. It was around 2.\nWhen we reached\
  \ the desert, light was still good. Buses were carrying people further to the main\
  \ desert area. From where the bus dropped us, there was a narrow road extending\
  \ into the desert.\nThe road ended into a round platform with a tower in the middle.\
  \ Following others, I too, climbed up the tower. And the view from there was simply\
  \ breathtaking. The blue sky and the water scattered all around the desert was giving\
  \ it a bluish tone amidst all white. It was like standing high above a white blue\
  \ ocean. *I could see the road that brought us to the tower, down below small children\
  \ with their parents playing in the roadside desert area, couples walking around\
  \ hand in hand, a small gathering near the foot of the tower where a small folk\
  \ band was performing and a few thinker souls sitting on the benches and looking\
  \ into the nothingness of the vast desert*. It was a scene of the lifetime.\nThe\
  \ sun had set now. People started returning to the buses. Spending half an hour\
  \ more browsing the shops, I called my driver for returning.\nThe road was dark\
  \ and dead as expected, but at last, I reached my hotel slightly after midnight.\n\
  Lying on the bed, I tried sleeping but couldn't. Just one thought echoed in my mind,\
  \ what if, at the station, I would have decided to return back without visiting\
  \ the desert ?"
