Text: "Cold air brushed my face as I opened the door and got out of the Nissan Qashqai\
  \ SUV. I was still dizzy and groggy from sleep and also from the steep winding roads\
  \ of the mountains. We went straight into the kitchen of the roadside house and\
  \ my nose picked the delicious aroma of spices which instantly startled my senses\
  \ delightfully. Large orange flames were alight, as if dancing against the logs\
  \ gagging the open hearth. An iron kadai was sitting on top of it, where our meal\
  \ was being prepared.\n\nI suddenly felt totally at home as we sat down on the benches\
  \ and started eating with our hands. As we savored the delectable yet simple and\
  \ extremely flavorsome chicken stew with boiled rice, the ordinary uniqueness of\
  \ my surroundings and the friendliness as well as the hospitality amazed me. The\
  \ lady of the kitchen was around, so were the other members of the family. It\u2019\
  s their home, where they lived and we strangers sat with them in their kitchen,\
  \ shared their food and space. We paid a nominal price but the experience was priceless.\
  \ I noticed, they shared their kitchen and space so naturally and easily with no\
  \ qualms. The sense of individual space is so dominant these days in our modern\
  \ lives, that sitting here in the remote corner of north-east India in Mizoram,\
  \ makes me ponder, how the space in their hearts and rooms have no walls. I sighed,\
  \ as I felt calm and restful in this perfect rendezvous of simple and delightful\
  \ spice and company. \n\nAs we washed our hands and got ready to finish the last\
  \ leg of our journey, I remembered a similar incident in this trip where we had\
  \ taken a coffee break in a similar house restaurant, where I used the toilet. My\
  \ friend who is a regular traveler in this region said I could take the left door\
  \ as a way to the toilet. When I entered the room, I was shocked to find someone\
  \ sleeping there. On my friend's insistence and my urgency, I reluctantly used the\
  \  toilet attached to this room. I emptied my bladder with the eagerness and speed\
  \ of an Olympic runner. As I came out, to my utter dismay, the man was awake and\
  \ he smiled at me. I forced myself to smile back and with utmost embarrassment rushed\
  \ out of his room. \n\nHis smile remained with me as the twinkle of the distant\
  \ mountain houses gradually faded behind us as our car moved ahead. \n\nI wonder,\
  \ in a world with such a hullabaloo on personal space, they didn\u2019t feel the\
  \ need for it, neither felt invaded of their personal space or privacy."
