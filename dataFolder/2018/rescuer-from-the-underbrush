Text: "I still uphold the notion that trekking the feral expanses in the scenic Gonarezhou\
  \ National Park is the most dauntless thing I've ever done since my only trip there\
  \ last spring. I felt so uncurbed the whole junket. The intrepidness probably stemmed\
  \ from the vastness the park offers.\n\n\"You couldn't have visited this entire\
  \ area during the war.\" Kembe, the burly guide to our small safari of three, shared\
  \ with us one breezy morning before a drive. \"Park was closed from the masses during\
  \ the liberation struggle and much of Mozambique's civil war. It was only reopened\
  \ in 1994.\"\n\"Right around the time I escaped my mother's womb.\" said Saru, a\
  \ spirited lady who completed the triad of our group. \n\nOn our fourth Gonarezhou\
  \ sunset, an eternal yellow-brown sundown that truly enriched the pristine red sandstone\
  \ towering cliffs of Chilojo, by the Runde River valley, over which the palatial\
  \ cliffs look, a fresh earthy whiff emanated from the moist riverbanks.\n\n\"Look!\"\
  \ Kembe pointed to a sturdy baobab tree just as a mighty bird donning a snow white\
  \ bod took flight flapping its large black wings thrice before letting glide as\
  \ it flew over the river for the cliffs. \"The African fish eagle!\"\n\"You've scared\
  \ it away,\" said Saru.\n\"Did you see those talons and those eyes? The king of\
  \ the air doesn't get scared so easily I'm telling you.\" Saru rolled her eyes,\
  \ prompting me to heighten my eagle laudation, \"I betcha it picked up a baby alligator\
  \ for lunch! Legend has it - \"\nKembe's grip on my left arm quietened me down.\
  \ I followed his glare - there she was, a stocky grey skinned fully grown bush elephant,\
  \ standing a few metres away from us. She was so close I could make out the wrinkly\
  \ black bristly hairs on her skin and the stark stench coming from her. Kembe whispered\
  \ \"Remain calm and silent.\" The elephant stood there and watched us. That's when\
  \ my phone alarm shrilled and the elephant tilted its head up and let out an agitated\
  \ rumble. She took a few charging steps forward before Kembe started pulling us\
  \ back slowly. Suddenly the elephant stopped and turned its head sideways.\n\nRight\
  \ there next to a dense underbrush was The Suni, a small reddish brown antelope\
  \ with red nostrils and black ringed bulging eyes in a stupor, staring at the frantic\
  \ elephant. The elephant studied the tiny mammal for several seconds - and the most\
  \ extraordinary thing followed, the elephant quietly turned and moved away. Saved\
  \ by The Suni from a raging African bush elephant - the last thing I expected."
