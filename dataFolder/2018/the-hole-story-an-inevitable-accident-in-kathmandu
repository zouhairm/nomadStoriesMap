Text: "Kathmandu undergoes constant roadwork. Uncovered manholes, open sewers, trenches\
  \ and random pits are all commonplace, and they appear and disappear daily. No caution\
  \ tape or pylons - just unexpected open holes. Combine these unpredictable chasms\
  \ with the scheduled power cuts that leave the city pitch black for most of the\
  \ night, and you have a recipe for disaster.  \n\nOne afternoon I was walking through\
  \ Sanepa with a friend, and we passed a series of deep, narrow holes in the road.\
  \ I clung to her arm and hissed, \"I have always been afraid to fall into one of\
  \ those.\" She recounted a story of nearly tumbling into one herself, and I had\
  \ to tell her to stop. \"No,\" I said, \"my knees are weak just thinking about it.\"\
  \ \n\n****\n\nThe following Friday I was heading home after a night of dal bhat\
  \ and Everest beers, and my taxi overshot my lane, pulling to a stop about 50 metres\
  \ up Lazimpat Road. I crossed the street and then, whoooooosh! \n\nI disappeared\
  \ down a sewage-filled rabbit hole. \n\nThe first thing I remember thinking was,\
  \ \"thank god I do not appear to have broken my pelvis,\" because I had been mid-stride\
  \ when I dropped into the trench. My legs were splayed akimbo and I was sunk into\
  \ the ground up to my ribcage. My knee throbbed and my right foot was strangely\
  \ warm. And slimy. And oh my god, what was that smell?\n\nThere was a flurry of\
  \ panicked voices, and a fleet of Nepali soldiers appeared. This had to be the most\
  \ surreal part of an already surreal experience - the local army conducts drills\
  \ at night along Lazimpat Road, and they just happened to be marching past as I\
  \ disappeared down the hole. Within seconds, two men had my arms and had hoisted\
  \ me out of the muck. \n\n\"Ma'am! Are you ok?\"\n\"THIS HOLE IS NEW! WHY IS THIS\
  \ HOLE HERE?\" I shrieked in surprise. I stood on the edge of the pit and tried\
  \ to parse what had just happened, and began to thank the soldiers for their well-timed\
  \ assistance. \n\nThe soldiers insisted on walking with me as I sloshed my way to\
  \ my apartment, asking my name and my country. The absurdity of what had just happened\
  \ started to sink in \u2013 I could barely answer them. I kept groaning, \"ewww,\"\
  \ and grimacing. It\u2019s hard to socialize (or have any ego at all) when you are\
  \ covered in human waste. \n\nFor the next few days, whenever I would run into my\
  \ friends they were absolutely horrified when I told them I had fallen into one\
  \ of \"the holes.\" \n\n\"Oh God! I've always been afraid of that!\" They would\
  \ exclaim in horror.\n\n\"Yeah. I know the feeling.\""
