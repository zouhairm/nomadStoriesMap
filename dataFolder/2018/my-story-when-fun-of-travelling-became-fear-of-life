Text: "It was my trip to Dudhsagar waterfalls when I learnt about my attitude towards\
  \ life. I was travelling illegally to falls after making some arrangements with\
  \ a local random person (guide) during the times of monsoon when the falls remains\
  \ closed for visitors. Initial 4 km of journey was to be walked along the slippery\
  \ and curvy rail track with abundance of dangerous insects. At a point, the guide\
  \ told me that we have to go through the wild bushes unnoticed from the Forest Officer.\
  \ Somehow we succeed but suffered numerous scratches and insect bites. I was remembering\
  \ all advertisements on the television which shows adrenalin rush and was feeling\
  \ proud of myself. What I didn\u2019t know was that actual adrenalin is yet to be\
  \ released. \nWe then reached a point where a water channel has to be crossed to\
  \ go further. I slowly started stepping into the water. The flow of water was very\
  \ fast and it seems increasing with each step ahead. By the time we reached middle,\
  \ I was neck deep in water and barely able to stand inside. I felt my sense of adventure\
  \ is now slowly turning into fear.  I was holding my guide\u2019s hand who himself\
  \ was struggling with the flow. With his approach, I realized that he was neither\
  \ trained nor was carrying any necessary equipments like rope, first aid kit etc.\
  \ The guide somehow found roots of an old tree in water and told me to catch hold\
  \ of it. One step ahead and the guide suddenly slipped into the water. The fragile\
  \ roots which we were holding could not bear the weight and broke off. To my worst\
  \ of fears, the water flow suddenly raised as if someone has pushed gallons of water.\
  \ I started screaming after being washed away with the current. My guide was nowhere\
  \ in sight and I was all alone flowing in the water. I tried to catch hold of any\
  \ rock for support but all in vain in such flow. I was feeling excruciating pain\
  \ after hitting rocks in between all over my body. Tears started rolling down my\
  \ cheeks thinking this might be the last day of mine. \nSomehow a group of 3-4 people\
  \ came into my sight after sometime. I shouted to them for help. One of them was\
  \ quick enough to respond and threw a rope toward me to which I hold on. Till today,\
  \ I do not know what happened with my guide. On my way back, I understood that being\
  \ adventurous and bold doesn\u2019t mean that one should break the laws and trust\
  \ any random person. It was a decision that changed my perspective towards life."
