Text: "I\u2019m on the Howrah Mail, one of India\u2019s most iconic trains, heading\
  \ for Srikakulam in Andhra Pradesh. I\u2019m sharing my compartment with two Indian\
  \ guys; one is talkative, and the other is not. Rushing by are the wet rice paddies,\
  \ and endless palm and coconut trees. I\u2019m also feeling hungry.\nI hear the\
  \ approaching cry of the chai wallahs. Tomato soup with croutons is offered too,\
  \ but I\u2019m nervous. I want to try it, but I\u2019ve heard that food and drink\
  \ can be drugged and once you\u2019re unconscious, they come back and rob you. Not\
  \ wanting to wake up in just my underpants with all my possessions gone, I resist.\n\
  Thankfully, the official Indian Railways food guy arrives; so I\u2019m on safe ground.\
  \ However, I\u2019m trying to order lunch without much success as he speaks zero\
  \ English, and I speak zero Telugu. Thankfully, the talkative guy in the bunk above\
  \ me rouses from his slumber and interprets. After several exchanges, I think I\u2019\
  ve ordered vegetable curry.\nOutside, rice paddies have all but disappeared, replaced\
  \ with fields and distant, alluring hills. Lush vegetation dominates, and being\
  \ monsoon season, a cool, grey gloom pervades. I see dhobi wallahs labouring on\
  \ the river banks, washing what looks like bed sheets or saris and laying them out\
  \ to dry.\nMeanwhile, the cleaner appears and sprays the carriage floor with a yellow\
  \ liquid and proceeds to mop. Our compartment smells sweeter and fresher momentarily.\n\
  The quieter guy, wearing a loud purple, green and blue striped shirt has drifted\
  \ off to sleep and is now snoring. Lunch arrives and the talkative guy climbs down\
  \ to partake. He introduces himself as Ravi Chakrabatti from Kolkata.\nWe laugh\
  \ about the quiet guy snoring soundly across the way. Ravi says it doesn\u2019t\
  \ matter what time of day it is, as this guy manages to sleep all of the time concluding\
  \ hysterically that, \u201Cmaximum snoring is there!\u201D\nRavi tells me that he\
  \ is an assistant manager for an automotive lubricant company and he is returning\
  \ home to Kolkata. Quiet guy has now woken up, and I discover he is a children\u2019\
  s clothing wholesaler from Nellore. He informs me that my station will be approaching\
  \ in about thirty minutes. I will be sad to disembark as this has been an inspirational\
  \ and enlightening railway journey.\nMonsoon clouds tower above the cooler hills\
  \ and hot plains below. We cross a railway bridge, arching over a wide and ponderous\
  \ river. The rhythmic clang and clatter of the train reverberates around the iron\
  \ framework before we arrive at last, in Srikakulam."
