Text: "I knew why I was in Peru, even if I didn\u2019t want to think about it, and\
  \ that was perhaps the strangest thing about it all. Your mother\u2019s death is\
  \ the kind of pain that nothing in the world can heal, a tangible pain that lingers\
  \ even after sixteen months, that nothing soothes except perhaps your physical displacement\
  \ to somewhere four thousand miles away with no memories. That was why I was in\
  \ Peru.\n Alejandro did not know\u2014who could have expected him to? I had a sense\
  \ he was dealing with his own pain as well. It was enough that we could sit there,\
  \ thirty feet above the Pacific Ocean on a rock outcropping, watching a sunset more\
  \ beautiful than anything we\u2019d seen in recent memory. He was a year younger\
  \ than I was, or perhaps two. He spoke English and played the guitar and that was\
  \ enough. We spent the better part of a week together\u2014he had nowhere else to\
  \ be, he claimed, except band practice. It was February and it was summer in Peru.\
  \ \n        There was a glorious slowness to the days in Lima. Everyone was late,\
  \ and no one seemed to mind. There were vague plans but they changed; people were\
  \ home, they wanted visitors; we visited, we ate, we drank chicha\u2014thick and\
  \ sweet. It had been my idea to climb the rock by the ocean. Everyone else was dozing\
  \ by the beach house but I was awake and watching as the sky lit up in a thousand\
  \ vivid shades of purple that I desperately wanted someone else to see. \n Wind\
  \ picked up from the Pacific, salty and damp, turning our hair frizzy as we breathed\
  \ it in and watched the lavender waves roll over themselves again and again. Alejandro\
  \ lit a cigarette and we sat, inhaling the warm wind and drifting smoke before finally\
  \ starting to talk: Colorado. Peruvian bands. Being the music-student son of an\
  \ engineer father, close to graduating but not close to knowing what to do next.\
  \ \n        I thought about my mom but for once, I didn\u2019t feel compelled to\
  \ talk about it. That reality would still be there when I went home\u2014if I went\
  \ home. For a moment, I thought about staying here in this country where it was\
  \ summer in February, where the capital smelled like car exhaust and mangoes and\
  \ the beach, where no one cared if you were late and where no one seemed lonely.\
  \ \n I looked over at Alejandro\u2019s thoughtful, bearded profile against the beginning\
  \ of the night sky. He, too, was lost in thought. \n \u201CI need to get out of\
  \ Peru,\u201D he said finally, and the warm wind blew our pain and our laughter\
  \ back towards the house."
