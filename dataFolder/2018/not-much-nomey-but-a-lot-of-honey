Text: "When my mom arrives from Moscow to Madrid to visit me, we usually escape to\
  \ places that we\u2019ve never been before. This time was not an exception.  After\
  \ trying to find some fewer expenses travel in Spain, we decided to change our destination\
  \ and just took tickets to Lisboa. Normally, due to my logistics studies I plan\
  \ and organize daily our trips, but that time my emotional level was low and also\
  \ was busy working.We decided that this time my mom organize places that we should\
  \ visit. I knew that she has got an amazing taste, but never knew that those places\
  \ that she had chosen will inspire me that much.\nSo one of the days, we just packed\
  \ some sandwiches, took some extra tog and went to the unknown destination.\nWe\
  \ arrived at the small city called Cintra by train. Rapidly, we found a restaurant\
  \ where we took an amazing cup of coffee with delicious raspberries cake. When we\
  \ wanted to write our review about the place on a famous platform, we were shocked.\
  \ Don\u2019t know how, but we've got talent to find best places. This restaurant\
  \ was a most rated place in the city. \nFull and happy we went to find a bus that\
  \ should take us to Cabo da Roca. At the beginning, I was not understanding where\
  \ we are going, but we took that bus. It was my crazies experience in bus ever,\
  \ he fully entertains people for that money. Seeing ocean, landscapes, small villages,\
  \ nature of the place. Wonderful. Until the moment when the bus started going on\
  \ narrow streets. Me praying to not fall down from the mountain. Tourists taking\
  \ photos.  Bus driver trying to do the best, but...When he tried to part ways with\
  \ a truck, even sleeping Japanese tourist started filming. Drivers shouting, people\
  \ crazy for the action, shocked. After 10 minutes of shouts and laughs, we continued.\
  \ \nWe arrived at this place, lots of people walking around, taking pictures. I\u2019\
  m a professional for finding best spots to sit, so I did this time.\nI sit on the\
  \ hillside, my mum repeated. I took out our sandwiches, clothed myself completely\
  \ from the ocean wind; and there sitting in the last point of Europe, eating homemade\
  \ food, you understand that you don\u2019t need that much to feel alive and happy.\
  \ Your family near to you, birds flying around, no wifi around, calm, old lighthouse.\
  \ From kilometres altitude you see waves beating stones, fish jumping from the water.\
  \ The eternal calm and peace in your soul and body.\nWhen you understand that you\
  \ are in the best place ever expected. Since then I love spontaneity and our low-cost\
  \ trips."
