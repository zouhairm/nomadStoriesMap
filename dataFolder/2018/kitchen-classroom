Text: "It took me weeks to learn all their names: who belonged to which middle-aged,\
  \ olive toned face. Names were just one of many hurdles I was learning to overcome.\
  \ I had ventured to Albania, the small Baltic country that snugs up to the western\
  \ side of Greece, to work at summer camps. The name Albania had only ever entered\
  \ my world through Harry Potter books as Voldemort\u2019s refuge of choice. Even\
  \ after making the decision to move there for a summer, I did little research. Thus,\
  \ I found myself in the fourth poorest country in Europe knowing nothing of its\
  \ past and even less of its present.\n Slowly, as I lived daily life in an agrarian\
  \ town at the foot of the arid Gramozi Mountains, I felt I was coming to know Albania\
  \ - Shqiperi in its own language. Slowly, as I woke every morning to bangs, chattering,\
  \ and smells from the kitchen, I came to know the kitchen ladies: Moza, Mile, Mirveta,\
  \ and Elvira. They all lived in town and could be seen early every morning walking\
  \ into the camp compound together, arm in arm, before quickly changing into their\
  \ white kitchen uniforms and colorful aprons. For those of us living at camp, they\
  \ became our mothers; making sure we had food on our weekends off, sneaking us big\
  \ buckets of petula (a puffy fried bread we dipped in bowls of white sugar), and\
  \ consoling us when the task of living in a remote town, working with children we\
  \ barely understood became overwhelming.   \n It was mornings I came to look forward\
  \ to the most and what I miss the fiercest. As summer began to wane, I chose to\
  \ stay. My world became a whirlwind, but the kitchen ladies grounded me, their kitchen\
  \ becoming both my sanctuary and my classroom. Together, we spent hours pointing\
  \ to objects and repeating words.\nSpoon. Fork. Knife. Lug\xEB. Pirun. Thik\xEB\
  .\n It was not just language I learned from them. Their lives had been marred by\
  \ a dark and isolating Communist regime. In a world where looking up to the mountains\
  \ towards Greece could get you arrested, joys were few but deep. The number of bad\
  \ days I had was not even a fraction of the suffering these beautifully time-worn\
  \ women had experienced from their country\u2019s totalitarianism and six months\
  \ of bloody anarchy. Yet, there they remained, the image of strength, raising children,\
  \ laughing ceaselessly, and purveying a happiness that was both grounded in harsh\
  \ reality and wholly youthful. To be taught this as an arguably self-centered youth\
  \ was a gift I would never have asked for and one few can bestow."
