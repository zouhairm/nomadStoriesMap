Text: "Well, this happens in the movies, right? You go out on a dinner date on a nice\
  \ evening in a hill station and see an environment like this and smile?\n\nMet this\
  \ little guy on a rainy new year's eve on the streets of Sikkim. He didn't speak\
  \ my language nor did I his.\n\nWe spoke one language called Football. And that\
  \ was more than enough to begin a game of skills. And certainly more than enough\
  \ to have a crowd applauding two guys play with rubber band wrapped makeshift sphere\
  \ they called Football.\n\nThe clouds above Sikkim had decided to break off the\
  \ New Year\u2019s Street Party and this sheltered alley with shut shops and exciting\
  \ game of football would have been the last thing people expected but adored anyways\
  \ the aluminium foil street soccer.\n\nPictures were clicked and people clapped.\
  \ And soon the rains faded and so did the crowd. It was just me and my date and\
  \ the little guy with a second hand tshirt to protect him in this chilly 4 degree\
  \ night. Not sure, how to call him up for a picture I extended my hand and hugged\
  \ him with my date capturing this camera shy guy.\n\nI tried asking him where does\
  \ he live in the best possible iterations of hand movements and spectacularly failed.\
  \ He just would not let go of his possession to tourist thieves like us. He just\
  \ mirrored that silent yet resilient look on his face. Upon prodding further, he\
  \ produced an ID and jabbered something repeatedly. \u201CD\u201D letter was christened\
  \ on it and it broke my heart.\n\nThe dreaded letter \u201CD\u201D in your voter\
  \ ID can spell \u2013 Doom, Deportation and Despair.\n\nI stood transfixed as I\
  \ tried to judge the direction of life of this illegal dangerous immigrant to my\
  \ society. Vanishing down a fleet of stairs in an instant, I ran after him. A labyrinth\
  \ of refugee camps underneath this famous street brought out a stark contrast from\
  \ that above.\n\nA family of eight Burmese eyes looked up at me as if judging my\
  \ purpose against the gloom of a single basement bulb. The language of understanding\
  \ has its limits and retreating was the best.\n\nTrips are a portal to happiness.\
  \ For they make you realize the things that you covet because you saw them in the\
  \ movies.\n\nThese expeditions reveal your true selves, to yourselves. They etch\
  \ out a demo of the life that you actually want in the next 50 years. \nBut hangs\
  \ in counter balance is a thread of lives that tug along the fringes of our humanity.\
  \ \n\nWe have been able to put a Mars mission into orbit but failed to tether a\
  \ rope of security around the hearts of this \u201CD\u201D company."
