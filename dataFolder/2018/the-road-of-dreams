Text: "Having emerged from presumably nearest to the bridge station, I found myself\
  \ on an uncharted boulevard, miserably lost in the middle of suburban Rome. Same\
  \ August sun that was just caressing the pure living art of the city centre was\
  \ now melting local malleable asphalt. An endless waltz of expressive cars and wayward\
  \ Vespas accounted for the absence of savvy pedestrians, main sources of information\
  \ on how to get to Ponte Milvio- the least acclaimed and yet perhaps the most influential\
  \ landmark in Italy.\nAlthough Ponte Milvio or the Milvian Bridge has had a rich,\
  \ eventful history, its recently discovered tender side is now its main attraction.\
  \  Here couples began the tradition of attaching padlocks to a public object as\
  \ a symbol of their love. The ritual that quickly spread around the world was first\
  \ invented by Federico Moccia in his book \u2018I want you\u2019. That book has\
  \ inspired me to study Italian and ultimately became the reason I ended up here.\
  \ Trouble was, while any road will lead you to Rome, nobody tells you the exact\
  \ one to take once there. With two hours until the flight home, even Tom Cruise\
  \ would consider the mission of finding the bridge and making it in time impossible.\
  \ \nAfter half an hour of going astray, when dramatic performance from the tear\
  \ ducts seemed inevitable, a sudden miracle impeded it- one of the bikes stopped\
  \ to give me a lift. Straightforward decision-making was soon followed by an unbearable\
  \ doubt- am I going to die by the hands of this suspicions stranger or will it be\
  \ his feverish driving that will get us both killed? Manoeuvring from one lane to\
  \ the other, our wheeled wasp took the lead in this dance- venerable Fiats gave\
  \ us way, Alfa Romeos cheerfully horned in approval and Vespas tried to copy our\
  \ movement. Freezing onto the driver, I cursed the traffic, this city and my lack\
  \ of better judgement.\nBut when we finally reached our destination, time froze.\
  \ It was like seeing a childhood celebrity crush and receiving an A+ for an ardours\
  \ project all at once. Unlike Coliseum\u2019s grandeur or the glory of Altare della\
  \ Patria, beauty of this bridge was quite, adorned only by melange of now banned\
  \ locks and luscious green trees around it. As I stood there, listening to Tiber\u2019\
  s meditative accompaniment, I\u2019ve realised that the only thing more important\
  \ than making a dream come true is having one. There was no more fear, anxiety or\
  \ need to catch that plane \u2013just desire to walk a new road instead."
