Text: "The traveller, as I have decided, is dualist. Half assured, half Philosopher.\
  \ They seek to find truth behind their actions, yet are, undoubtedly and unequivocally,\
  \ lost. Disorientated in efforts to reconcile their absent understanding of the\
  \ self. \n\n\"Why I am here?\", becomes their motto. Its truth lay adrift by its\
  \ immensity of understanding. In nature, it becomes a horrifying reminder of how\
  \ little we know.  \nOur lives are controlled. Driven by the madness in society\
  \ and the disorder of inequality.\n\n\"Are we really free?\" \nSo many people remain\
  \ shackled by society's prejudice. \nI've spent my life questioning this. It drives\
  \ me insane. Furious with angst and panic. Especially now. \nOf all times in my\
  \ life, I will be graduating next year. And I have no clue where my life is heading.\
  \ The reality is bleak, and self-doubt plagues my mind. \n\nI am lost.\n\nMy world\
  \ had been met by the cold hand of death. The previous year, the suicide of a friend\
  \ drove me away. I couldn't take the sadness. The campus remained a remembrance\
  \ of failure. \nI could not stop it, then, or change it, now. \nNo matter how hard\
  \ I tried. \nI transferred universities. Being closer to the familiar was the priority.\
  \  \nLost in a sea of second year students. I am the new kid. No-one wants to know\
  \ me. I, again, am alone. Go-figure.\n\nWith my newly set up student account, I\
  \ receive an email. \n'Calling all humanities students. Would you like to go to\
  \ India next month?' \nThe opportunity driving an instant reply, \"Yes.\" My eyes\
  \ glistening, as the words pool into my head. But more questions than answers immediately\
  \ come to mind. Nevertheless, I'd already made the decision to go. And no-one would\
  \ stop it.\n\nMy choice, already, I knew, will be epic. Intuitively, it may be the\
  \ best decision I'll make. \nAs easy as one payment, my godsend of a student loan\
  \ would come in handy. Luckily, I can make do with the, smallish, parting of money.\
  \ \n\"Could this be my chance for redemption?\"\nI'd spent my days at university\
  \ procrastinating about the future. This trip would be my chance to recuperate.\
  \ Gathering my strength before the looming year of my dissertation.\n\nI have arrived.\
  \ 3am. The warm, stagnant air lingers. The airport seems familiar. They all do.\
  \ Yet the darkened surroundings, remind me otherwise. This is my chance to mature.\
  \ To take control of my own. If, ever, there was a chance, this was it. To tell\
  \ him. \n\n\"Hi Dad.\"\n\"\u2026 I'm Gay. I'm sorry if this comes as a shock. I\
  \ just thought you should know.\" \n\n\"Love, Kyle.\""
