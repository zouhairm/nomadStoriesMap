Text: "Stories are the best way to remember or gather message, to express one\u2019\
  s self, explore the culture and to pass information to the new generation. Love\
  \ to travel and gather stories are inherited from my dad. One recent experience\
  \ is a tour to a beautiful Northeast mountain state of India named Meghalaya means\
  \ \u201Cthe abode of clouds\u201D in Sanskrit. \n\nInteracting with local people,\
  \ a strong suggestion to visit the oldest traditional house in the state was given.\
  \ The villagers had embraced their tradition very well. We were greeted Pynchong\
  \ and his family. It was pitch dark even though the sun did not set. A small bulb\
  \ in the middle of the room lit after few minutes, which could hardly fulfill its\
  \ purpose may be due to very gloomy wooden interiors. Khasi is the only tribe in\
  \ India where a male accompanies his bride to her home. The youngest female child\
  \ of the family gets the maternal property, this is how Pynchong and his wife inherited\
  \ the home. The other daughter's husband needs to build a house and the inheritance\
  \ continues. It was funny to realize that most of the boys would wish to get a bride\
  \ youngest in the family. A child acquires a name from his mother for the rest of\
  \ the life; Pynchong title is \u2018Khongjee.\u2019\n\nThe hut made of traditional\
  \ bamboo mat style walls and hay on the roof. Unchanged the wooden flooring, bamboo\
  \ walls, and the ceiling still adds the charm to their abode. There were many unique\
  \ features like old style fireplace and the tiny kitchen area with 2 small hearths\
  \ or \u2018chulha\u2019 which used wood or coal for the fire. Pynchong seemed to\
  \ be skillful and welcoming could make bamboo baskets, caps also burnt a traditional\
  \ hookah for us. The house required better restoration instead of it getting demolished,\
  \ being this old made with love and affection by the previous generations prevail\
  \ a historic hut in the country.\n\nAnother tale of the 900-years old \u201CMawphlang\
  \ Sacred Forest\u201D, famous for the rains and some very rare plants. The tribe\
  \ believes that the forest and its people are blessed and guarded by the Gods and\
  \ one gets curse if the \u201CRespect the Forest\u201D rule is unfollowed. We learned\
  \ many stories about how the clan\u2019s changed with the time, why nothing should\
  \ be taken out of the forest and of the sacrifice tombs.\n\nThere are several things\
  \ to learn and understand, how people ensure to continue their culture and beliefs\
  \ throughout generations. Meeting the locals, knowing their stories gave me a chance\
  \ to relive my country\u2019s vibrant and diverse culture."
