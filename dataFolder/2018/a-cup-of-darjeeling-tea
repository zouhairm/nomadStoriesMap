Text: "The chugging sound of the steam engine coming through the window draws me out\
  \ of the deep slumber. I peep out from the comfort of my blanket towards the foggy\
  \ window pane only to find the scattering darkness. It was a freezing morning in\
  \ Darjeeling and a glimpse of the beautiful town nestled in the lap of snow covered\
  \ peaks of Kanchenjunga held my attention for long, through the now opened window.\n\
  Stepping out in my faded yet warm blue jacket, I crossed a man with pulpy face and\
  \ stern eyes selling the morning paper on the railway tracks behind a carriage.\
  \ And a little distance away a young boy in a small eatery bends to offer a hot\
  \ steaming tea in a yellow porcelain cup, as he saw me walk towards him.\nI then\
  \ raise that dirty cup to my lips as the woodsy aroma fills up my nostrils. And\
  \ as the amber liquid slides down my throat I watch the morning sun drench half\
  \ of the colorful city in its warm light while the other half still lay in the cold\
  \ shadows. And I was mesmerized watching the powerful game play between the shadow\
  \ and the light. \n\u201CMadam, paisa?\u201D the young boy asked me and pushed his\
  \ grimy hand forward while holding the kettle in another. I place the now empty\
  \ cup on the table top and open the wallet to pay him only to find it equally empty.\
  \ I check for holes in my wallet when I remember feeling sick at the back of that\
  \ shared jeep last evening while arriving in Darjeeling. And leaving the bag alone\
  \ on the back seat for a few minutes flashed in my head like a bad dream!\n \u201C\
  Madam, paisa?\u201D the young boy asked again while knocking his fist on the table\
  \ this time. \nI helplessly start to check for some loose cash and coins in my pockets\
  \ when I hear someone order a cup of tea in a rough and a dry baritone and paid\
  \ for two. I look up to find the same old man who was selling newspaper, standing\
  \ there. He raised his cup while looking at me and left. And I was left speechless\
  \ over such a kind gesture. \nAmong the chaos of the bustling city I was left with\
  \ a content grin on my face. That was last thing I expected after the realization\
  \ of being pick pocketed in a stranger city. And I rushed back to my room find that\
  \ secretly stashed credit card somewhere in my rucksack all the while still holding\
  \ my grin!"
