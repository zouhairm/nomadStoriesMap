Text: "Two friends and I were in Amsterdam for a few days. To return to Portugal,\
  \ we had booked a flight from Brussels, and we were to go from Amsterdam to Brussels\
  \ by bus. But we missed our bus, and it was too late to get another one or to find\
  \ another way. So we missed our plane as well. We were really disappointed and very\
  \ worried, it felt like a nightmare. We went to search for flights but all of them\
  \ were now really expensive. So we had another idea: rides. We got a cardboard and\
  \ wrote \u201CAnywhere South\u201D, and we went to the roadside. And guess what,\
  \ it worked! Of course it took a long time to find a ride for the three of us, but\
  \ we did got a ride from Amsterdam to Antwerp. So we decided to visit the city before\
  \ trying our luck again with the rides. Then, we tried again and we made it to Brussels.\
  \ We stayed for the night, and tried again the next day. This time, a really big\
  \ truck offered to take us to Luxembourg. I loved the experience, as I\u2019ve always\
  \ wondered how it was like for these drivers to drive this huge trucks for a long\
  \ time, all across Europe. The driver was really nice, he showed us the truck, where\
  \ he slept and all that. And we went to have dinner with him at a service station\
  \ by the highway, where all the trucks stop. As you can imagine, from there it was\
  \ easy to find another ride, among all those trucks. We got our next ride, this\
  \ time to Lille, in France. So there we were, one step closer to our country. \n\
  Unfortunately, I can\u2019t tell you about every single ride we took, but all I\
  \ can say is that we made it to Portugal using this method, almost without spending\
  \ any money! After a while we realised it was really hard to get rides for the three\
  \ of us, but by then we were confident enough to part ways, so we took rides individually,\
  \ and we would meet each other on the destination. Sometimes, each of us went to\
  \ a different place, but that was part of the adventure. And some of the people\
  \ who gave us a ride, also gave us a place to sleep. It was awesome. We got to meet\
  \ local people and we got to visit a lot of cities, even small cities, that we never\
  \ heard of and we never thought we would end up there. It turned out to be more\
  \ exciting than our planned trip to Amsterdam. We visited cities like Amiens, Rennes,\
  \ Toulouse, Bilbao and Santiago. And we made it safe and sound to Portugal, with\
  \ an incredible story to tell, having visited a lot of cities, a lot of countries,\
  \ and having met a lot of nice people."
