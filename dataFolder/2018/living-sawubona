Text: "A few years ago, I found myself unsettled and in desperate need of an adventure.\
  \ I craved excitement, the unexpected and even some danger. I found my answer in\
  \ Cape Town, where I\u2019d scored a magazine internship. \n\nStepping off the 24-hour\
  \ flight, one of the first things I learned about the country is that it operates\
  \ at a slower pace. Though frustrating to some, I soon realized it allowed for more\
  \ meaningful conversations. In Zulu, a common greeting is sawubona, which translates\
  \ to \u201CI see you.\u201D It\u2019s a simple yet powerful thing to say to someone\
  \ else. One word affirms their dignity and worth and shows appreciation to the enormous\
  \ gift of their presence. \n\nIt's an ethos that seeped into my bones. I treated\
  \ every day and person as a rare gift, a chance to experience something I otherwise\
  \ never would.\n\nI got a daily dose of danger on my way to work by hopping inside\
  \ an overcrowded minibus, a rickety white van that would make mothers across the\
  \ U.S. pull their children closer. At the magazine, I worked on stories that allowed\
  \ me a glimpse of Apartheid\u2019s lasting power. I talked to white CEOs in expensive\
  \ houses and visited townships on the fringe of the city, where black families called\
  \ home a one-room shanty house made of cinderblock and corrugated metal. \n\nWhile\
  \ South Africa was changing my worldview, it was also feeding my soul. Once a month,\
  \ as dusk drew near, I climbed Lion\u2019s Head for a full moon hike. The conical\
  \ shape of the mountain allowed for a 360-degree view from the peak of a light show\
  \ unlike any other. The sun slipped below the horizon in the west, triggering a\
  \ slow-motion color explosion. As darkness settled in, deepening the oranges and\
  \ pinks, the moon steadily rose high above our heads in the east, paving the way\
  \ for thousands of stars to follow suit. By the end of the night, moonlight bathed\
  \ everything in a white-silver hue, guiding us safely back down the mountain. \n\
  \nWhen my internship ended and I returned home, I assumed I would have the same\
  \ itching feeling and look to again escape the monotony as soon possible. \n\nBut\
  \ rather than seek adventure elsewhere, I rediscovered worn paths I\u2019d taken\
  \ for granted and attended events I\u2019d always been too busy to go to. I saw\
  \ the humdrum place I\u2019d left with the reverence of a visitor and gained an\
  \ appreciation for the here and now. Bored, I realized, is a mindset we can change.\
  \ The truth is, each place we find ourselves has something special about it, if\
  \ we only allow ourselves to really see it."
