Text: "As a 24 year old woman who has never solo travelled before, I have always wanted\
  \ to experience independence within a different country. Always working extremely\
  \ hard as a support worker and a nanny, I would save my pennies religiously to save\
  \ for a holiday. After working for months on end I saw and ad for Australia. An\
  \ airline company was having a sale. I decided to have a look at their website to\
  \ discover I could afford two trips. I was so excited, I decided to book a trip\
  \ to the Gold Coast and Melbourne. I paid for the flights via online banking but\
  \ when it came to booking hotels I didn\u2019t have a credit card or debit card\
  \ so I was searching for another way of payment. I discovered my bank has cash passports\
  \ so I applied for one. A cash passport is like a prepaid credit card which made\
  \ it easier for me to book hotels and attractions. I also had to organise transport\
  \ for getting to and from places so when I got to the airport I went to a convenience\
  \ store and bought a bus card. In the Gold Coast I went to sea world, movie world\
  \ and Ripleys believe it or not. In Melbourne I went to the Victoria Market, Melbourne\
  \ Gaol and the aquarium. I love solo travel and I wish I had done it so much sooner."
