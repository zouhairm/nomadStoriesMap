Text: "My friend and I woke up knowing that it was the day we were to leave Odessa.\
  \ With our bags packed, we said our goodbyes to our host and left. Outside of her\
  \ apartment building the thick air, that hung above the cities streets, slapped\
  \ us in the face, taking our breath air. One weighted step at a time we wandered\
  \ to the bus station. \nAfter much confusion we jumped on to a mini bus that was\
  \ full of people and various pieces of luggage hiding within the dark blue interior,\
  \ appearing as if some people had decided to try for a new life across the Moldavian\
  \ border. \n It took some time to get out of Odessa, allowing us to see the city\
  \ for one last time. We darted between the lanes as we roared through the overcrowded\
  \ roads. With my head pressed against the window\u2014and my body pushed up against\
  \ the man beside me \u2013 I stared out and watched the aged buildings fly by that\
  \ stood behind arching trees. I needed no music to entertain me as the world that\
  \ surrounded me was alive and I could hear the melodies that the life of the city\
  \ was composing. \n After some time the bus started to slow down to a crawl as we\
  \ had reached an abandoned military checkpoint: the border. A wire fence stood on\
  \ either side of the road, with trees that led to a stream to the right and to the\
  \ left a vast field. Our passports were taken, our bags were checked and we were\
  \ told to wait. \n Our bus driver signalled me over whilst muttering some incomprehensible\
  \ words. Of course, I obeyed his command. My friend and I were taken to the wooden\
  \ office, where a number of soldiers resided, to find out that I was not able to\
  \ leave due to the fact that I \u2013 or at least they thought  \u2013 was wanted\
  \ by Interpol. The hours passed very slowly, made even slower by the death stares\
  \ that the older soldiers directed our way, leading me to doubt my own innocence.\
  \ Any attempt at communication was generally shrugged off or was aggressively dealt\
  \ with, which, as you can imagine, put us more at ease. \n To my delight I was informed\
  \ of my innocence and allowed to leave the border. Our bus had already left and\
  \ we did not know when the next one would be coming, or if we would be able to jump\
  \ on. Over the uneven tarmac we ventured, exiting on the side of Moldova and waited\
  \ with our thumbs in the air, putting our hopes into the people that drove on passed."
