Text: "I live in Barcelona for 4 months.  I\u2019ve never been here before moving,\
  \ so my life literally started from zero. The first thing I did, was getting lost\
  \ in the city. I closed my eyes and I took a deep breath, I could hear all its noise,\
  \ and with every step of the way I felt embraced by it. Images flutter and I am\
  \ chasing them one by one. After I catch them, I grab them with force, I taste them\
  \ and I devour them whole. The process repeats and requires a lot of time. I am\
  \ not nervous, I am just anxious to live everything I had already known about its\
  \ nights. The truth is I am not sure what to do with my eyes because they want to\
  \ be in all places at once.\nThe architecture here is different than everything\
  \ I now. It is a place where all diverse spaces connects. It has neighborhoods where\
  \ geometry is everywhere. Perfect squads separated by streets with platan trees\
  \ at every step. Sometimes looking up in the sky, you can make a synthesis of the\
  \ space and watching the facades you can imagine how the city looks from inside.\
  \ Visiting the museums  will make your experience go further and it is the best\
  \ way to find interesting stories about the old city. During the night the city\
  \ is still awake and sometimes it looks like it came back to life. All the lights\
  \  fascinate me, a lot of images that might well have no particular meaning are\
  \ going on with a more than generous flow behind my eyes. I realized  it is behind,\
  \ because at some point I closed my eyes and the pictures are still there. \nWalking\
  \ through Gotico neighborhood,  with its small streets, cozy pubs and fancy balconies,\
  \ and passing after it to Plaza Espa\xF1a where the boulevards are large, the experience\
  \ changes completely. \nTo taste the real Barcelona food, you should go to small\
  \ restaurants you find in the neighborhoods. What I like the most in this small\
  \ restaurants is the hospitality and of course the amazing taste of food. You can\
  \ stay there having lunch and find yourself making friends with the owners who are\
  \ usually serving you. Asking them what they love the most about Barcelona is basically\
  \ finding the best places to visit.\nOn top of all that there is the beautiful and\
  \ calm Mediterranean sea.\nI know now this is going to be my home for a long time."
