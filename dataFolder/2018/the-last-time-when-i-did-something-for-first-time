Text: "I firmly believe that we all have a list of dreams and goals. I got mine and\
  \ it is a whole challenge to achieve each point. \nIn this list, there are \"someday\
  \ of these\" dreams of. When? How? Who knows? Anyway, I will get them. If you like\
  \ to travel so much like me, perhaps you and I agree that one of the dreams of the\
  \ list mentioned above is travelling to any interesting destination. The last thing\
  \ I expected was to achieve one of them in December 2016.\nFirst, I would like to\
  \ ask you a question: Do you remember your first trip? Probably we were too young\
  \ to remember every detail, but surely we will remember how excited we were. Now\
  \ let\u2019s think of the first international trip we did. For me, this is higher\
  \ level, leaving my country to learn about other cultures, meeting new people and\
  \ getting amazed with new landscapes.\nNow, let's go into context; my dad received\
  \ recognition for his work, from his boss at the end of November 2016. \nThe following\
  \ days were busy, I did not expect to carry out all the process of getting my passport\
  \ for the first time and the U.S.A. visa. The most intense day was when we had the\
  \ interview at the Embassy, the four of us were anxious, but not purchased with\
  \ the day in which we got the mail that we could pass to claim our passports with\
  \ approved visas. Now the only thing was waiting for the flying day.\nEverything\
  \ was a complete adventure from the first hour of that day. We made a deal with\
  \ my sister, I would be by the window seat going and she would in turn coming back.\
  \ We sat, I preferred to see the clouds under us through the window, the majesty\
  \ of the Caribbean Sea, and the ships sailing beneath the waves toward the horizon.\
  \ I took many pictures. It was exciting to see everything from a different perspective.\
  \ Once on U.S. soil was on another planet. Immediately I got goosebumps.\nOur travel\
  \ was consists of visiting the parks. Something I which reflect and something I\
  \ did not expect, after the Orlando parks are in creativity that has the people\
  \ who design each of the attractions. I don't think that I\u2019m the only person\
  \ who thought about wants to live in the parks of Orlando. \nI had never felt how\
  \ I felt at that moment. Incredible experience.\nI liked so much this trip, so much\
  \ that I not expected to dream with this awesome travel on holiday\u2019s season\
  \ after several months. In the dream, we come back to Orlando but with more family\
  \ and friends so they live this beautiful experience also."
