Text: "After just three months of dating, I decided to move away with him. I had never\
  \ heard of Tallinn before, but I was in love, or at least I thought I was. In your\
  \ early twenties, you think you have everything figured out. \n    At our final\
  \ dinner in the States, it hit me. I was officially homeless, unemployed and had\
  \ a one way plane ticket to a country I had never been to. But as I stared into\
  \ his dark eyes, I was somehow completely calm and genuinely stress free. His large\
  \ Adam's apple bounced aggressively as his lips galloped information which I blissfully\
  \ ignored. His sculpted jawline and clean shaven face made him appear more somber\
  \ than handsome, but his features came together crisply to a sum of attractiveness.\
  \ I swam further into his gaze pretending to pay attention while I day dreamed a\
  \ life of adventure. I had no idea that the next one hundred days of my life would\
  \ teach me an invaluable lesson.\n    For his birthday we went to Paris. We ate\
  \ gelato on the Seine. It was warm, but not hot. The sun shined, lifelessly, hundreds\
  \ of fireflies drifting down creating a mirrored reflection on the river. We let\
  \ our legs dangle idly, our feet submerged in the cool river, while we enjoyed our\
  \ guilty snack. We laughed about how we would get fat together. For dinner, I surprised\
  \ him with reservations atop the Eiffel Tower. A preset four course dinner, paired\
  \ with wine I could not pronounce. Unlike our Russian neighborhood in Estonia, we\
  \ felt comfortable as two gay men eating dinner at the most romantic place on the\
  \ planet. In that moment, that almost undetectable sense of freedom became more\
  \ certain and harder to ignore because we were anchorless.\n    After just two months,\
  \ we were roommates more than lovers. It started when I suggested another trip.\
  \ Such a remarkable experience our expedition had been, that I did not want to stop.\
  \ He wanted to stick to frequenting Russian bars. We argued, but soon after, we\
  \ weren't even fighting anymore. The silence was worse. I grew bored, not of him,\
  \ but of my predicament. He told me we should stay in Tallinn and figure things\
  \ out between us. The next day I was on a ship, alone, crossing the Baltic Sea to\
  \ anywhere. I came to realize, that although I did love my boyfriend, it was the\
  \ traveling, not the companionship which kept me happy. I was young, void of any\
  \ commitment or responsibility, and selfish. We had shifted directions in our relationship\
  \ and individual paths. I had evolved while he had acclimated."
