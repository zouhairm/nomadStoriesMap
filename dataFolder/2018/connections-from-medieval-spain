Text: "We met threw a language exchange website, Carlotta and I. Each Wednesday, we\u2019\
  d meet in a different sun-lit square of Seville and chat. It didn\u2019t take long\
  \ to become more than just language \u2018tandems\u2019. When she invited me to\
  \ her hometown of C\xE1ceres, west of the geographic and cultural heart of Spain,\
  \ Madrid (which incidentally sounds much more romantic when said with the Spanish\
  \ \u2018th\u2019 at the end instead of the English \u2018d\u2019), I thought she\
  \ was just being nice. But soon I was watching the rolling, endless innards of Spain\
  \ \u2013 la meseta - drift past the windows of the Alsa coach bound for Carlotta\u2019\
  s hometown. \nC\xE1ceres rarely features on the Gran Vuelta de Espana, perhaps due\
  \ to its isolation from the main nerve centres of Spanish tourism. That\u2019s not\
  \ to say that it has been forgotten. The world\u2019s biggest TV show decided that\
  \ the medieval stone architecture, looming city walls and towers perched upon a\
  \ hill overlooking la meseta were perfect. \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 put the city\
  \ on the map, despite being assigned UNESCO World Heritage status in 1986. There\
  \ are few, if any, signs of modernity as you wind through la Parte Antigua. Carlotta\
  \ pointed out the nests of the town\u2019s famous cig\xFCe\xF1as which crown many\
  \ buildings and posts, adding to the air of timeless medievalism.\nEach November,\
  \ C\xE1ceres hosts El Mercado Medieval, when the city\u2019s history floods through\
  \ the cobbled streets on a tide of a thousand stalls and medieval characters worthy\
  \ of a Hollywood blockbuster \u2013 just more authentic. I was glad to have Carlotta:\
  \ for an outsider, it\u2019s pretty overwhelming. El mercado is divided into three:\
  \ the Jewish, Moorish and Christian quarters, reflecting the multicultural history\
  \ of the town. Carlotta showed me the best places to find Moorish tea (sipped from\
  \ beautiful painted glasses with a selection of Moroccan sweets), cochinillo (pork\
  \ belly cooked over an open fire in the middle of a medieval tent filling) and turr\xF3\
  n (Spain\u2019s nougat): don\u2019t leave without trying any of them.  \nThe intermingling\
  \ of the three cultures was striking. Muslim, Christian, Jewish: C\xE1ceres, was\
  \ shaped by each, and they were all celebrated equally. The multi-faith cauldron\
  \ of medieval culture made me feel more connected with the city and its people than\
  \ I thought possible in one day. Strange that in the midst of a medieval market\
  \ I found one of the best examples of tolerance, multiculturalism and how they connect\
  \ a local community to its past and present. We could all learn a lesson from medieval\
  \ C\xE1ceres."
