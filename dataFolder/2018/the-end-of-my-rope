Text: "\u2018I cannot remember a time when I didn\u2019t climb.\u2019 The rugged Pembroke\
  \ coast was a risky choice for the first spring climb. As the grey sky is reflected\
  \ in the water lapping beneath us, a flicker of recognition briefly lights his impenetrable\
  \ face. He knows we are of the same tribe! I wait for the words to come, to confirm\
  \ the connection, to grant me some ground to stand on. Instead, he checks the rope\
  \ clipped into my harness, and looks at me in anticipation of the command, ready\
  \ to begin the ascent. I suppress the growling desperation. \u2018Climb when ready,\u2019\
  \ I nod. He turns towards the cliff face and reaches for the first slippery hold.\
  \  \nSilence has become so resident in his life it drowns out all other noise. His\
  \ friends tell me he used to talk a lot. A limb was not the only thing lost that\
  \ day a year ago. \nHe makes his way up, smoothly, in control, inserting gear into\
  \ the rock, clipping the rope as he goes. I watch, transfixed, neglecting to take\
  \ in the imposing landscape. His right prosthetic hand stretches out to reach for\
  \ a tiny hold far above his shoulder. The exposed muscles on his back tense as he\
  \ pulls on the hold, shifts his weight onto it, and hauls himself over the top of\
  \ the overhang. Zero waste of energy. Shadows falling on his figure sharpen as he\
  \ anchors the rope, the sky threatening with rain. The signal for me to climb comes\
  \ with a caring look. He is thinking. I begin to paw my way up the limestone wall.\
  \ Twenty metres until the final ledge. I hook my left heel into a crack, twist my\
  \ body sideways, stretch out my left arm and wrap my hand around a sloping blob\
  \ protruding from the wall. Bringing myself up, I reach with the right hand, now\
  \ freed to make the final move. And I slip. \nHe was ready. Years of training along\
  \ this spectacular coastline help him arrest my fall. \nI reposition myself on the\
  \ rock and resume the ascent, the tight knot of desperation dissolving into intimate\
  \ confidence.\nThis time it is him, not me, at the end of my rope.\nI reach the\
  \ ledge, pull myself up and collapse next to him, spent. In the stillness of the\
  \ evening, for a brief moment, the Celtic sun breaks through the clouds.\nHe turns\
  \ to me. His eyes make a lacerating inscape into mine. He lets me see. No fluff.\
  \ Raw, un-medicated passion. The vulnerability is steely, too brittle to shatter.\
  \ He has been tying in with me for months now, trusting me with his life. I finally\
  \ connect the dots.\nMore was gained today than just the summit."
