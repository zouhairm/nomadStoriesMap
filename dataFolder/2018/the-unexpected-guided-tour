Text: "[...]The stay on my last island destination \"Tres Bocas\" is strange. I follow\
  \ the only (this time at least concreted) path through thick shrubbery, when after\
  \ barely 100 meters, a stray dog joins me and a few hundred further a second one.\
  \ Briefly I think of the aggressive dogs on the Way of St. James, with whom I once\
  \ had the \u201Cplaesure\u201D to make acquaintance. But these two dogs are very\
  \ dear and - um, please?- seem to show me the way I have to go. They walk ahead,\
  \ wait, bark briefly and then make a turn. I decide that these dogs probaly know\
  \ more about this area than me and I simply follow my two four-legged tourist guides.\
  \ Less than ten minutes later, I arrive at a small canal and walk it along with\
  \ my two guides. On both sides of the canal are partly simple, sometimes incredibly\
  \ luxurious houses. The evening sun slowly sinks towards the river and the rich\
  \ colors of the flowers in the golden evening sun try to outshine one another. Excuse\
  \ me if this description sounds cheesy but in reality everything was even more golden\
  \ and rich than any of the postcolored Lord of the Rings movies. \nThroughout the\
  \ journey the two dogs are not leaving my side.They scare away every other mutt\
  \ from the homes nearby that wants to bark at me. An exclusive guided tour, almost\
  \ as booked. All that is missing is the other dog explaining the local surroundings\
  \ to me. \nAt some point the concrete path just stops and goes into swampy mud.\
  \ I continue for about 200 meters and as I was thinking I probably shouldn't have\
  \ trusted these dogs so blindly, I met a very old, incredibly dear lady. She smiles\
  \ because of this unexpected Visitor from Germany. Although I understand less than\
  \ half of what she tells me I'm trying to answer as well as possible with my rudimentary\
  \ spanish skills (20%) and gestures (80%). She seems even more happy when she hears\
  \ I have been speaking spanish for only three weeks. All the while she is holding\
  \ and patting my hand, only letting me go after a few besos (kisses) and hugs and\
  \ the assurance that I'm on the right path.\nActually, the people in the Delta are\
  \ incredibly relaxed and friendly to me. When you ask for something and people realize\
  \ that you do not understand them right away, they explain it with hands and feet\
  \ until they feel like you do understood it. Both the dogs and the old lady were\
  \ proved to be right. Only five minutes later I eat empanadas on the terrace of\
  \ the only restaurant on Tres Bocas and drive with one of the last boats into the\
  \ sunset back to Tigre. \nWhat a great day."
