Text: "Sometimes we start the journey hoping to find answers, but we become answer\
  \ for others. I was in Erasmus meeting party when I said \u201CYes, lets do it\u201D\
  \ to a Polish boy who asked me if I wanted to go by hitchiking to Porto with him.\
  \ Because, I was planning to travel to Porto in a few days by bus and he was also\
  \ planning to hitchike as he was a hitchiker. But he tought I was drunk when I said\
  \ \u201Cyes\u201D, so he wanted to confirm next day. Yes, that would be my first\
  \ hitchiking experience. But it would not be the last one... After some months,\
  \ I would remember my Polish \u201Chitchiking teacher\u201D when I was on the road\
  \ hitchiking from Covilh\xE3 to Lisbon with my ex-boyfriend Jorge when a Portuguese\
  \ couple stopped their car in front of us. I always believed that being on the road\
  \ would bring what we needed. But obviously that time it was not for me...\n\nWhen\
  \ we got into the car, we learnt that the couple already passed us but they thought\
  \ it would be difficult for us to find a car in there; so they decided to return\
  \ to pick us. They started to talk and when Jorge told them I was from Turkey, both\
  \ of them looked at each other openeyed in shock. Soon, we would understand why...\n\
  \nThe company which the woman was working for asked her to go to Turkey to work\
  \ there for a while. But she was very confused as she did not know if she should\
  \ go or not because of her fears about the country and the difficulties she could\
  \ have as a woman in work environenment. That\u2019s why they decided to visit Fatima\
  \  and that\u2019s how their car stopped in front of us. We listened the whole story\
  \ bewilderedly, then we had a stop to have a coffee all together. I have talked\
  \ to her about the possible risks which could be anywhere but also beauties that\
  \ Turkey had. We arrived to our destination with their help. Obviously, they also\
  \ did.\n\nAfter some time, I learnt that she decided to go and she was very happy\
  \ and satisfied with all the conditions in there. Sometimes we start the journey\
  \ hoping to find answers, but we become answer for others. We never know what journey\
  \ brings. For sure, they did not know that they were picking up their answer to\
  \ the car then they decided to return and stop for us. We all ask questions and\
  \ look for answers somewhere. Sometimes we just need to stop to get them. If you\
  \ do not know where to stop, do not worry, universe will help.\n\n PS: Fatima is\
  \ a small town and important place for Christians which takes pilgrems and visitors\
  \ each year from all over the world."
