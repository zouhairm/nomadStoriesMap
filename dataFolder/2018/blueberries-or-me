Text: "There is a stink in the air. A familiar stink of wet dog, but laced with the\
  \ funk of rancid grease and rotting logs. It is either the fetor of fear steaming\
  \ off my flesh, or...I am trespassing over prime grizzly real estate.\n\nThe alder\
  \ brush is too thick to see through, as dark as a cave. If I hope to attain the\
  \ summit of this hill overlooking Wonder Lake, deep inside Alaska\u2019s Denali\
  \ Park, I will have to push through to the sunlight beyond.\n\nI kneel with ears\
  \ pricked for the slightest of sounds. No grunts or growls. Still, that scent\u2026\
  .\n\nAlways sing or talk while hiking through the backcountry, that's what the Ranger\
  \ told me. Moose and caribou don't sing. You must distinguish yourself from dinner.\n\
  \n\u201CGround control to Major Tom,\u201D I croak, the only lyrics that come to\
  \ mind through the fog of terror in my brain. \u201CTake your protein pill and put\
  \ your helmet on....\u201D\n\nAfter repeating these lines a dozen times, I emerge\
  \ from the thicket. Air has never tasted so sweet. Then I gaze downhill. And there,\
  \ not ten yards away, snout in the air, dark eyes on mine, stands ursus horribilis,\
  \ nine hundred pounds of muscle, teeth and claw, his coppery coat glinting in the\
  \ sun.\n\nMy heart flops like a hooked trout.\n\nIf everything goes wrong, the Ranger\
  \ told me, talk calmly and soothingly while slowly walking backward.\n\nSlowness\
  \ is a requisite now that all my joints have seized. But calm, soothing, and walk\
  \ have fled from my lexicon. A hoarse whisper of \u201CGround control to Major Tom\u201D\
  \ is all I can muster. \n\nHe holds my gaze for another thirty seconds. Then gives\
  \ his shaggy head a shake, and shoves his muzzle into a blueberry bush.\n\nAn inch\
  \ at a time, I stand, then back-pedal up the hill. The grizzly fill his stomach\
  \ before ambling away. And gradually, like the arctic gray frog that freezes solid\
  \ every winter only to thaw out each spring, something inside of me begins to melt.\n\
  \ \nFar below, the blue-black water of Wonder Lake glimmers with silvery eels of\
  \ sunlight. The taiga is a blanket of green moss, tiny pink clumps of moss campion,\
  \ wild purple geraniums and alpine bearberry. An arctic fox stalks a ground squirrel.\
  \ A hawk cuts a lazy gyre in the sky. \n\nThere is life everywhere, in every direction\
  \ I look, a frantic fecundity, a mad dash for life in a growing season that begins\
  \ and ends too quickly. \n\nAs I gaze across this vast wilderness, a profound indebtedness\
  \ envelops me\u2014a gratitude that a creature so blundering and egocentric as man,\
  \ is allowed to have a place in it all."
