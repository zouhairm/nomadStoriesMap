Text: "Its 11 pm at Haridwar railway station. Everything in and around the station\
  \ is closed down. There is no choice, but to spend the night on the platform itself.\
  \ I find a place to lie down and try to get some sleep, but I am unable to. The\
  \ chill in the air is unforgiving. I wonder if I had made the right decision to\
  \ travel solo. My father had suggested otherwise. He had warned me, \"I won't be\
  \ surprised if you come running home within a couple of days.\" It was harsh. I\
  \ had taken it upon myself to prove him wrong.\n\nThe night was cold and I ended\
  \ my restless slumber. It was time for that priceless cup of tea. In India, you\
  \ will find tea sellers at midnight even if the entire station bores a deserted\
  \ look. While I was slowly sipping in my tea, I heard a voice. It was an old white\
  \ blonde man rubbing his hands together to keep them warm. What grabbed my attention\
  \ was that he ordered tea in Hindi. It is the last thing you expect of a foreigner.\
  \ I was intrigued. On enquiring, I came to know he was an Englishman named Peter.\
  \ Here we were, at midnight on the station with our respective tea cups. What more\
  \ do you need for a nice and long conversation!\n\nPeter lived in Rishikesh since\
  \ childhood. His wife was an Indian. Living here, he had felt the need to learn\
  \ and speak in Hindi.\nImagine both of us conversing in Hindi. We both pulled each\
  \ other's leg. I joked, \"Your forefathers left in 1947 and probably, they mistakenly\
  \ left you behind.\" We had a laugh. The other joke was if he owned the brand Peter\
  \ England, but he had a good comeback. He responded, \"Yes, I do. I could hire you\
  \ as a sales boy. You seem quite witty!\" It was all good banter.\n\nAt the end\
  \ of the trip, Peter invited me for a impromptu stay at his house. He ran a yoga\
  \ centre. I quickly realised that the centre was majorly visited by foreigners with\
  \ few Indians showing up. I was like, perhaps, PM Modi has made yoga go truly global.\
  \ But, it was thought provoking. Indians invented yoga, but somehow it doesn't appeal\
  \ to most of us anymore. Perhaps, it is also time for us to connect to our glorious\
  \ traditions. \nOn the last day, Peter showed me around Rishikesh. How many times\
  \ would you bet for a Brit to take an Indian to show around in India? Probably never!\n\
  \nPeter is truly an inspiration. Hindi has helped him gain trust amongst the locals\
  \ whom he has employed at his yoga centre. He loves tea, follows yogic lifestyle\
  \ that includes organic farming, has married an Indian girl. He is our very own\
  \ old 'desi' dude!"
