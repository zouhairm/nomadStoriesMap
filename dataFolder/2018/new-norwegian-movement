Text: "I looked up sleepily to the illumination of the notice board. The words Oslo\
  \ Sentral shone towards me. I stood in anticipation of my exit. As I left the station,\
  \ I found myself on a clean, busy street; the feeling of affluence filled the atmosphere.\
  \ I walked slowly down the immaculate street, past the endless supply of exclusive\
  \ boutiques. I caught a glimpse of my reflection in a shop window, tired eyes and\
  \ pale skin, the results of the previous drunken night. I noticed the juxtaposition\
  \ of myself against the stunning city backdrop and fashionable Norwegians. I sighed.\
  \ The hard wind hit my face, which only added to the Nordic city\u2019s allure.\
  \ \nI see Ina walking towards me. She is donned in a beige trench coat, her blonde\
  \ hair hitting her shoulders as she walked and her luminous blue eyes smile as she\
  \ greets me with a kiss on the cheek.  She appeared so effortlessly chic and fashionable.\
  \ \u201CI can\u2019t believe how long it\u2019s been since I\u2019ve seen you,\u201D\
  \ Ina said as we walked along Oslo\u2019s renowned cobble stone streets. The next\
  \ few minutes carried out in similar vein as Ina and I walked and talked like old\
  \ friends.\nWe entered a relatively normal looking park; I looked up at rows of\
  \ very graphic and naked statues. We were at the famous Frogner Park, that held\
  \ many naked statues sculpted by the Norwegian artist, Gustav Vigeland. We looked\
  \ around at the park, Ina pointed out the penises on the male statues\u201Dlook\
  \ at that detail\u201D, then she pointed to a woman statue, where there seemed to\
  \ display a flat surface where their genitalia should be. \u201CWhere\u2019s the\
  \ vagina?\u201D  She joked every time we came to a woman statue. I think the joke\
  \ represented the new age of Norwegian thinking, a movement dedicated to feminism,\
  \ of equality, where the youth demand a fair chance for everybody. \nAs the pink\
  \ sky from the sunset lowered onto the backdrops of ships in the renowned Oslo harbour,\
  \ we sat at a restaurant nearby, my eyes looked to the menu as my eyes widened,\
  \ \u201Cthe cheapest meal on here is 300 crowns\u201D I said almost gasping, \u201C\
  don\u2019t worry, it\u2019s my shout\u201D Ina replied.  Oslo is so incredibly expensive\
  \ but the Norwegians understand this and will often pay for things for you, the\
  \ generosity of the Norwegians adds lengths to the feel of the city. I looked around\
  \ and realised that Ina had introduced me to a city rich in culture, filled with\
  \ a fresh outlook of a New Norwegian movement. It truly is a city, not for the tourist,\
  \ but a city for the affluent. Oslo. My sweet Oslo."
