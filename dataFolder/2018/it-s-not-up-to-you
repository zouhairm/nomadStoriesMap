Text: "The anxiety knotted within my belly leapt out of my throat with a cry, as the\
  \ sharp crack of lightning split the sky wide open. I barely recognised my own voice\
  \ against the heaving winds pressing the jungle closer. Yet we drove on, as the\
  \ dirt path ahead became more river than road, and the plastic sheeting doors of\
  \ the three-wheeler whipped water into our eyes.  \u201CI KNEW it would be hard\
  \ to get here but....\u201D I grasped John's hand tightly as I trailed off, unsure\
  \ where this thought was going. Unsure where my life was going. He shook his head,\
  \ patting my hand absentmindedly as he gazed into my soul. \u201CNo no no. Ask anybody\
  \ here. It is always harder to leave. It's not up to you. Choco will decide.\u201D\
  \n\nI hadn't expected to venture here; it was the result of frantically scouring\
  \ the internet at the end of a business trip. Weeks of daydreaming of the possibilities\
  \ from the comfort of my desk somehow still resulted in a 2am Spanglish whirlwind\
  \ of flights and accommodation and trekking adventures. I had booked my flight to\
  \ Choco after stumbling upon a hostel that promised a jungle meets island vibe,\
  \ organic food gardens and composting toilets, waterfalls and humpback whales and\
  \ turtle sanctuaries. This would provide the space I so desperately needed to reflect\
  \ on my career, my relationships, my values. Here on the Pacific coast of Colombia,\
  \ only accessible by light air craft from Medellin, I would decide whether to turn\
  \ my back on everything i'd worked so hard for. That was the idea, at least. \n\n\
  I soon learnt that life unfolds differently here. Bookings are lost, your basic\
  \ Spanish no use and the bad juju is strong. Here, boys yearn to be men, demanding\
  \ kisses and attention, and refuse your refusals. Fresh produce is limited to what\
  \ you grow and catch yourself, and the traditional means of living dies a little\
  \ with every elder.  But it is also here that the real men read your tarot and eye\
  \ gaze beneath waterfalls. Soccer games are dictated by the tide, and coconut oil\
  \ production by the moon. And the haunting call of birdsong summoning the day is\
  \ unlike anything you've ever heard, as you rock in your hammock in the thick salty\
  \ air and the tribal drumming fades with the night.\n\nAnd it is here where I wait\
  \ for the storm to pass or miss the four flights I need to get back home, to get\
  \ back to work. This is the last thing I expected, but perhaps exactly what I needed\
  \ to learn; that uncertainty is certain and the unexpected.... well. It's not up\
  \ to me. Choco will decide."
