Text: "\"We can travel the world together!\"\n\nMy biggest weakness has always been\
  \ naturally seeing the world through rose-tinted glasses. It's how I convinced a\
  \ guy I dated for just one year to quit his job and move across the world with me.\n\
  \nWith a couple of passports and two backpacks, we flew to the Land of Smiles.\n\
  \nChiang Mai itself feels like a city where East meets West. The city is full of\
  \ temples and delicious home-cooked Thai dishes. But even amidst the history clearly\
  \ seen throughout the city, you'll find Western food, modern toilets, and great\
  \ WiFi.\n\nGiven how it's an easy escape into the countryside if you want to escape\
  \ the busy city, it's just as easy to start feeling at home in Chiang Mai.\n\nBut\
  \ it's also easy to feel homesick. The holiday season came and passed, and I watched\
  \ my partner sink further and further into depression daily.\n\n\"Let's go home,\"\
  \ he told me as he booked a ticket back home.\n\nDid I want to let someone else's\
  \ mid-life crisis pull me back to a life of collecting furniture and home decor?\n\
  \nOr did I want to continue collecting passport stamps?\n\nSuddenly, I went from\
  \ never traveling alone to traveling solo in a foreign country.\n\nThe overwhelming\
  \ feeling of being alone hit me like a crashing wave on the plane from Thailand\
  \ to Indonesia. I tried hiding my tears from the 8-year-old girl staring at me from\
  \ across the aisle. I convinced myself I had made a grave mistake.\n\n\"There are\
  \ a lot of solo travelers here,\" my Balinese driver assured me as he drove me from\
  \ the airport to a hostel.\n\n\"I probably won't talk to any,\" I silently told\
  \ myself, being overdramatic, as usual.\n\nOnce I checked into the hostel, I closed\
  \ the curtain around my bed. I let the cyclone of depression continue pulling me\
  \ in as I held back tears and hateful thoughts.\n\nIn the weeks that followed, I\
  \ forced myself out of my comfort zone and learned exactly what it means to get\
  \ bitten by the travel bug. \n\nA day in the office can't replace a day of chasing\
  \ waterfalls with solo travelers from 5 different countries. An hour-long commute\
  \ can't replace driving past Asian rice fields. Bitter cold temperatures can't replace\
  \ an entire day on the beach of sharing stories. Small talk at the water cooler\
  \ can't replace learning how to say hello and thank you in different languages.\
  \ Watching the daily news can't replace visiting a temple and learning about an\
  \ area's hidden history.\n\nI'll choose a new passport stamp over a piece of Ikea\
  \ furniture any day."
