Text: "Have you ever thought about how the most interesting things in life happen\
  \ when plans change, leaving us to roll with the punches and play leapfrog with\
  \ fate? That\u2019s what happened to me last time I was in Haiti. I was stranded\
  \ when my passport somehow got shuffled into one of my fellow missionary\u2019s\
  \ luggage in the hours before the flight and I couldn\u2019t find it to board the\
  \ plane, and because of that one small incident I wound up meeting someone that\
  \ gave me ultimate bragging rights among my friends. \nI had gone to Haiti to help\
  \ check on the progress made in rebuilding schools and churches in the year after\
  \ Hurricane Sandy and, while there, had made some good friends. On the final day\
  \ of the trip, while helping us pack, one of those friends had accidentally shuffled\
  \ my passport into my companion\u2019s luggage. I remember watching the plane (and\
  \ with it my passport) take off and thinking to myself that luck had jumped by me,\
  \ leaving me stranded in an unfamiliar country with little money. Fortunately, my\
  \ friend Lionel was a former embassy worker that preached at one of our churches\
  \ in Port Au Prince. After I missed my plane he was able to take me to the embassy\
  \ and walk me through all the security checkpoints. As we bypassed the line I remember\
  \ hearing a very large man ask the security guard why I got to go ahead of them\u2026\
  \ that man, I later learned, was 12 year NBA veteran, Olden Polynice. It was my\
  \ turn to jump ahead in the leapfrog game of life. I passed through all the hoops\
  \ effortlessly and soon found myself waiting on a plane in the airport lounge again.\
  \ I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for a guaranteed seat, so I was put on reserve,\
  \ but I was at least now inside the airport. \nAs I sat waiting, I heard a familiar\
  \ voice greeting me. It was the big man from the embassy. I stood as he introduced\
  \ himself, and I was surprised to discover that he had played for the Seattle Supersonics\
  \ when I was a kid, and was the first Haitian ever to be drafted in the NBA. We\
  \ spent the next two hours discussing my church and his career, as well as his plans\
  \ to establish a Haitian basketball league as a means of creating jobs (constructing\
  \ stadiums, support services, etc.) and bringing joy to a place that had so much\
  \ hardship. When the next plane left, he was on it and I was yet again left behind\
  \ to spend the night with my friends. I would catch the plane home the next morning,\
  \ and returned home with an appreciation for the things that happen when you fall\
  \ a little behind schedule."
