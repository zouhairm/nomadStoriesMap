Text: "I jump and wonder mid-air\u2013What lives in the water? I know of caiman, piranha,\
  \ and electric eels to name a few, but the water is kicked with mud. How can anyone\
  \ be sure? Maybe something larger than we thought, darker shadows, or something\
  \ sharper? By the time the current carries me to where the riverbank inclines, I\u2019\
  m content with shadows.\n\nA short hike from the river, I settle into a hammock.\
  \ The jungle performers sin\u2013AM sopranos, afternoon altos, midnight mystery\
  \ guests. Everyone breaks into groups and I catch pieces of conversation. I\u2019\
  m reminded of Jaws\u2013Robert Shaw and Richard Dreyfuss comparing scars.\n\n\u201C\
  Getting ideas for your book?\u201D asks a traveler.\n\nI\u2019ve written short stories,\
  \ poems, articles, essays, technical manuals, proposals, and grocery lists, but\
  \ I haven\u2019t attempted a book. I was sure it was between the jungle trees and\
  \ leaves, maybe disintegrating with plant debris, getting picked apart by ants.\
  \ But thoughts of books slip from my mind while I'm here. Instead, I pierce my ear\
  \ with a porcupine quill, eat wild plants, and test a biting ant as a makeshift\
  \ suture.\n\n\u201CWhy do you read?\u201D the traveler asks. He thinks a moment,\
  \ perhaps about his own life. \u201CTo escape?\u201D\n\nLater, I wade into the water,\
  \ shuffling to deter stingrays. Everything I am stems from a hope for escape. I\u2019\
  m up to my hips now and feel something nibble on my toe. I get the urge to submerge\
  \ myself completely. \n\nWe spend an afternoon climbing a 70-foot tree. It doesn\u2019\
  t have the comforting low-hanging branches of trees I grew up with. This tree is\
  \ being consumed by a Strangler Fig, a species that overtakes the tree, spreading\
  \ tentacle-like vines and stealing sunlight.\n\nWhen I emerge from the canopy, I\
  \ see the jungle unfold like Alice\u2019s chessboard. Only 2-5% of sunlight ever\
  \ reaches the forest floor, and it makes for a lot of shadows. I fold into a Y-shaped\
  \ perch. If I could build a home here, I would \u2013 me, the shadows, and the Strangler\
  \ Fig.\n\nOn our last night, we drink a few beers. Chickens run beneath raised houses.\
  \ A skinny dog nearly disappears when it turns sideways. After dark, I shine my\
  \ light on the grass and thousands of crystalline orbs sparkle back. I know they're\
  \ spider eyes but this place makes me brave.\n\nBack home, I sit on the edge of\
  \ my seat and write. It\u2019s labored and unsure, but what matters is I\u2019ve\
  \ jumped, and plan to keep jumping. At least for a little while, I escape into the\
  \ words. The river flows on, and two things remain \u2013 travel the world and write\
  \ what I see there."
