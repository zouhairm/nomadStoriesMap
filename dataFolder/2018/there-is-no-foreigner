Text: "Amidst a myriad of colorful clothing, pungent perfumes, and diverse dialects,\
  \ the ebb and flow of city center marketplace pulsated with crowded masses native\
  \ to the bi- weekly bedlam. Warm smiles radiated interpersonal commerce, proving\
  \ a lingua franca of human experience that transformed the town square into a melting\
  \ pot of compassion, immune from unforgiving temperatures that plummet with dwindling\
  \ hours of daylight.\n\nOn the perimeter of the extravaganza, a young monk sat crouched\
  \ against a wall with poise, marveling at the spectacle of organized chaos before\
  \ her. Though coats and scarves were seen in plenty, she wore only a shining orange\
  \ toga that left nearly half of her right torso exposed to the elements. \n\nA younger\
  \ child, overly clad in winter attire, hobbled around the corner and stopped at\
  \ sight of the monk. The young monk giggled, then bowed her head before the child.\
  \ \n\nThe stand nearest them wafted smells of ancient traditional spices, and displayed\
  \ three hues of grain rice. Naive to the cost, the child began searching his parka\
  \ pockets for another nickel as the seller, observing the comedy, turned his coin\
  \ thrice in hand. After a moment, the man walked around his wooden kiosk and kneeled\
  \ down beside the little hooded child. On a piece of burlap sac, the man handed\
  \ the child enough rice for a small family meal.\n\nAs the child skipped out of\
  \ sight with the empty burlap cloth in hand, I could see tears streaming from the\
  \ spice merchants face looking upon the grateful young female monk, recipient of\
  \ the loving donation.\n\nShe stood and approached me. Her scintillating eyes emanated\
  \ purity. She cackled an uproarious laugh toward the sky as every. last. grain.\
  \ trickled like a rain stick from the bowl into my humbled hands. Tears welled in\
  \ my eyes as she bowed and whispered, \u201CNamaste.\"\n\nI proceeded to the spice\
  \ cart, bowing my head and holding my rice filled hands up in offering to the merchant\
  \ from whence it came. He sobbingly motioned with both of his hands for me to keep\
  \ it and took me in embrace until we regained our composure, having both been reminded\
  \ that it is not the gift that is sacred, but the giving. We smiled brightly at\
  \ one another. \u201CNamaste,\u201D I spoke, feeling whole, as a participant and\
  \ witness that borders of contrast prove only to be illusory when simple acts of\
  \ kindness paid forward lift the veil.\n\nThere is no \"foreigner\", we are all\
  \ tourists sharing this planet and when we treat others like \u201Chome\u201D it\
  \ begins to feel that way."
