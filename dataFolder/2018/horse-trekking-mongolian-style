Text: "Today was the day of the big horse ride, and I\u2019m not talking about the\
  \ Melbourne Cup. It was the day of the 24km horse trek. Or to be more apt, my worst\
  \ nightmare. The horsemen arrived with the beasts and I eyed them off, looking for\
  \ the lamest horse of the pack. Once astride, I  gripped at the reins tightly as\
  \ I was led off into the barren landscape by my leather-faced Mongolian guide. Some\
  \ had very relaxed horses. So relaxed in fact that mid-walk up a hill my cohort\
  \ Philip\u2019s simply sank down on its legs to lay down, with Philip still seated\
  \ on top.\n\nAfter our first stop, my guide decreed me fit to ride alone. I found\
  \ this out when he rode off and I was left with no choice but to make the horse\
  \ move by myself. It was a break up I certainly wasn\u2019t expecting. I wanted\
  \ to yell at him \u2018don\u2019t leave me! I\u2019ll be better, I know I can make\
  \ this work!\u2019. However, I decided to take it in my stride, or my horse\u2019\
  s stride to be more accurate, and focus on staying alive.\n\nThe ride was mountainous\
  \ and rocky in parts but my well-behaved horse helped to keep my uneasiness at bay.\
  \ The only minor hiccup occurred when it appeared we had lost half our party, and\
  \ my part of the group was left with two Mongolian guides that didn\u2019t speak\
  \ English. We took refuge at a deserted horse shelter whilst one of the guides rode\
  \ off to investigate. There was very little shade under the crumbling wooden frame\
  \ of the shed, and beads of sweat and anxiety formed on our skin.\n\nThe other half\
  \ didn't reappear but we started moving again regardless. Soon I could see our new\
  \ camp site in the distance, and my shoulders sank into my back in relief. However\
  \ it was at this point that fellow trekker Michael\u2019s horse flew out of the\
  \ pack, and started to gallop like a lightening bolt towards the gers in the distance.\
  \ Michael tried to stay atop but lost his balance as the horse made him sway with\
  \ its uneven footing, and he toppled to the ground.\n\nConcern filtered back through\
  \ the group as we made our way towards Michael\u2019s motionless frame. When we\
  \ reached him we were grateful to see his legs moving. It soon became obvious that\
  \ he had injured his collarbone. After relocating Michael to a ger to lay down,\
  \ arrangements were made for him to be taken to hospital. \n\nThis cemented my view\
  \ on the evilness of horses. I wasn't the only weary one though. Later that day\
  \ our main guide asked the group who would ride tomorrow. Everyone stared at each\
  \ other and eventually, very slowly, hands raised up. The ride must go on."
