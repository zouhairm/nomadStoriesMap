Text: "\"I'm going to go look for him,\" I say to my fiance of just three days.\n\
  With that, I put down my tea cup and exit the cafe that we had been sitting in,\
  \ squarely in the bustling Grand-Place in Brussels.\nIt is a dreary day in March\
  \ and the majestic buildings look down at the throngs of tourists.\nEven though\
  \ he dressed in the same unremarkable attire as everyone surrounding him, I spot\
  \ him immediately.\nHe is overjoyed to see me and gives me a hearty embrace. Fresh\
  \ off a train from London, he is now here and ready to explore a new country with\
  \ me.\n\nI had met Jim nearly five years earlier at a volunteer assignment in South\
  \ Africa. \nJust months before that fateful trip, I would have never have expected\
  \ to have made it there.\nI was at a point in my life where I felt very lost. I\
  \ was working a dead-end job with no opportunities for advancement. My current relationship\
  \ felt stagnant. I knew deep down that I had so much more potential. I knew there\
  \ was so much more to life. I had big dreams of exploring the world, but those dreams\
  \ felt so out of reach. Something had to change.\n\nWith a lot of courage, I brought\
  \ myself to quit the job that no longer inspired me and put some distance between\
  \ me and my partner. I took my first solo, international flight and spent a month\
  \ volunteering in South Africa.\n\nI could write an entire book on that experience\
  \ alone. As to be expected, volunteering left me profoundly changed. What was unexpected\
  \ was the close ties I would form with my fellow volunteers.\n\nWe were an odd mix.\
  \ Stacey and I were both 23 and Jim and Scott were both in their 50s. We had totally\
  \ different backgrounds, but we had one thing in common: our love of traveling and\
  \ volunteering. Throughout that month, we became like family. It truly broke my\
  \ heart to say goodbye to them on that last day.\n\nNow it has been nearly 6 years\
  \ since South Africa. For the first time since then, they will all be attending\
  \ my wedding in a few months. \n\nIt just goes to show you that you can make the\
  \ most important friendships of your life when you least expect it. If you have\
  \ the courage to leave everything and everyone you know, you will inevitably meet\
  \ new people; people that will change your life. Traveling has always been the greatest\
  \ of teachers for me and part of the lessons come from the friends you meet along\
  \ the way."
