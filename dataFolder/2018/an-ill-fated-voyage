Text: "My mutiny began, I suspect, like many others in maritime history. In rolling\
  \ seas, on a questionably seaworthy wooden boat, with a captain whose judgment I\
  \ was seriously beginning to question. It ended a day later. Dumped unceremoniously\
  \ onto a barnacled wharf on Vancouver Island, watching both bereft and relieved\
  \ as my mislaid hopes disappeared over the horizon. As mutinies go, my two co-conspirators\
  \ and I got off rather easy. We were quickly able to source food, lodging and safe\
  \ carriage back to Victoria, Vancouver Island\u2019s relaxed capital. Still, it\
  \ was an inglorious end to a bold mission \u2014 eight women trying to row an open\
  \ dory longboat 750 miles up the Inside Passage from Canada to Alaska. \n\nWe had\
  \ departed Victoria 7 days earlier to much fanfare. With the unofficial title \u2018\
  America\u2019s Cup for dirtbags\u2019, the Race to Alaska is a punishing contest\
  \ between soul and sea. The only rules state that you have to make it to Alaska\
  \ without a motor or support. It rewards masterful naval know-how, ingenuity in\
  \ the face of inevitable hardship and bulldog tenacity. Qualities, it quickly became\
  \ apparent, that I lacked. The other women on the crew bled saltwater: two Alaskan\
  \ ship captains, a tugboat captain, a shipbuilder, sailors\u2026and me. A bespectacled\
  \ Australian public servant. Ostensibly, brought along to be part of the human engine\
  \ of the boat. Extra support at the oars. No seafaring experience necessary. \n\n\
  The first few days of the race were briny and meditative. The early-morning slap\
  \ of the oars attracting mischievous otters who guided us through the various straits\
  \ of a byzantine archipelago. The islands were dense craggy landscapes robed in\
  \ cedar, fur and spruce. At night, we slept on the pitching boat, lulled by the\
  \ lapping waves and the howl of wolves. \n\nThe atmosphere darkened as we began\
  \ our approach towards Seymour Narrows, the graveyard of many ships and sailors.\
  \ The tide shifts dramatically at Seymour Narrows, funneling water down a narrow\
  \ channel, throwing up Charybdis-like capsizing whirlpools. A day out, I started\
  \ to panic. We had spent the previous night beached on a sandy island. A miscalculation\
  \ that seemed too basic a mistake for a crew attempting to cross one of the world\u2019\
  s most treacherous waterways. I learned many lessons from my time as an ill-fated\
  \ oarswoman. Panic is contagious and has no place on a boat. Captains are not to\
  \ be questioned. And that, when pushed to the edge, the spirit of a mutineer can\
  \ hide in the most unlikely of people."
