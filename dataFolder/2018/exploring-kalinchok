Text: "The scenic beauty of hills and mountains, the local lifestyle, adorable cottages,\
  \ denizens of Kuri village, the local delicacies, the fresh air away from the polluted\
  \ capital, the different feeling I experienced were the main highlights of my trip\
  \ to Kalinchok. Exploring the place was not less than coming across an adventurous\
  \ trip, although it was supposed to be a visit to a place where we expected to witness\
  \ snowfall. It was those yellow hills with a reflection of the setting sunrays that\
  \ kept me motivated to walk for some time as our jeep was denying to run in the\
  \ uphill off road. The 6-7 hour drive from the capital turned out to be a day-long\
  \ effort to finally reach a resort at Kuri village. It was already dark when we\
  \ reached, so I could see billions of stars in the sky with such clarity that it\
  \ looked like glitters spread in a black chart paper. Back in the capital, due to\
  \ heavy smog and dust, I had very rarely experienced such a beautiful view. It felt\
  \ like magic. However, the little more dipping temperature was troubling us. I danced\
  \ the night out with my friends in front of the campfire followed by the dinner.\
  \ The essence of the local food felt so pure and healthy.  \nBack in the room where\
  \ 4 of us shared one room with locked windows and doors due to excess cold, I felt\
  \ a little unconscious with less oxygen to breathe. My nose was burning a little.\
  \ Thank god, we had to wake up in the wee hour to climb the hill. \nThe relaxing\
  \ feeling I got when I finally reached atop the hill and capture the sunrise, visit\
  \ the temple there, the local \u2018chhurpi\u2019 I tasted while returning down\
  \ the hill and the tete a tete I did with the local women there in Tamang language,(as\
  \ I belong to the same community), all these feelings made me have not a slightest\
  \ regret for lying to my parents that the group trip was a collage tour.  Not only\
  \ the Hindu devotees but the place has been a center of attraction to many youngsters.\
  \ It was the onset of the winter, a perfect time to reserve a jeep or scoda and\
  \ play with snow at the top of the hills where there is a small temple of Kalinchok\
  \ devi a hindu goddess. However, we didn\u2019t get to play with snowfalls, apparently\
  \ the main reason behind visiting the place. Nonetheless, I don\u2019t have any\
  \ disappointment because the memories I garnered there, going on a trip to somewhere\
  \ outside the valley for a night away from my home, was incredible."
