Text: "It was 2017 Winter Days, blinky lights and pretty candles everywhere, music\
  \ playing in the background, faces beaming of happiness. It was Christmas Eve. We\
  \ were seven people, sitting, talking, eating cake. It was all so calm and chill\
  \ until one of us said, let's go on a trip!! A second later, six eyeballs rolled\
  \ towards him. Each one of us was looking at him in utter silence, waiting for him\
  \ to share more about this trip. Finally, he spoke, breaking the silence, \"We have\
  \ six days left before the next year kicks in. I want all of us to explore. This\
  \ trip will not be the normal day kind of trip. It will be more of exploring and\
  \ learning and making connections.\" By now six people present in that room were\
  \ intrigued by this description. We wanted to hear more of it. He continued, \"\
  We are not going outside our city. We will stay here, take a holiday, and we will\
  \ travel. We will travel around the city, on our bikes and cycles. We will experience\
  \ our city. We will establish a local connection.\" We were all startled. Our eyes\
  \ sparkled in anticipation. We were all in for this experience. It was different,\
  \ something new. It would help us learn and understand. \n\nNext day, the sun showed\
  \ up, and we got up. We packed our backpacks. Though we were not leaving the city,\
  \ we were in full feels of our trip. We started on our bikes, and as a naive traveller,\
  \ we continued. We saw the people, met the locals, ate the local food, took the\
  \ local transport, saw the sunset and sunrise. We went into the tiniest markets,\
  \ narrow roads, we covered every nook and corner. What we discovered, was an ethereal\
  \ beauty. We didn't buy any handicrafts, but we met the locales behind it. We saw\
  \ them, we talked them out, their lifestyle. We stayed at one of the local's house\
  \ for a day. We saw their culture and ate their food. Now we knew, so much more\
  \ about the temples, their architecture, the concepts behind what they do and why\
  \ they do. We were in that city for more than seven years, but never really took\
  \ time out to just sit back and observe. Those six days were the best decision and\
  \ investments. It was like we relived our seven years and more in only six days.\
  \ My tip for all of you is that before you step ahead to explore more about the\
  \ other cities, first take a round of your own home. Stroll around the footpaths,\
  \ have roadside tea, see the people, talk to them, eat at local joints, take the\
  \ common transport and experience the beauty your place, your home has gotten in\
  \ it to show you, Love!"
