Text: "Kateryna tugs the inferior rushnyk from my hand, fingering the frayed ends\
  \ contemptuously. \u201CI will call the best embroiderer.\u201D Her mouth is drawn;\
  \ her pale-blue eyes brim with concern. \u201CHer work is beautiful\u2026but these\u2026\
  \u201D She shakes her head in despair and gives the embroidered towel an open-palmed\
  \ caress as if it were a feverish child. \u201COk, let\u2019s go.\u201D She turns\
  \ abruptly. \u201CI will call her now.\u201D \nWe drive along the Dnieper, two hours\
  \ south of Kiev and modernity, to Central Ukraine where the soil is dark and moist\
  \ like used coffee grounds. Sown along the steppes, indistinguishable white cottages\
  \ with blue shutters replace the steel and stature of Kiev.   \nKateryna slows down.\
  \ \u201CWe are close. Look for a floppy-eared dog playing with goats.\"\nValentyna,\
  \ the embroideress of Frankivka, waves us down from her cottage stoop, \u201CHere!\
  \ Here!\u201D She throws her head back in silent laughter. Propping the door with\
  \ an elbow, she wrings her hands of kitchen juice, \u201CCome!\u201D Her husband\
  \ is bobbing on his toes behind her, motioning us inside. \nThe coolness of Kiev\
  \ has melted away. Valentyna is beaming. Her husband closes his calloused hands\
  \ around mine and guides me into the living room as we slip off our shoes.  \nOur\
  \ hosts lead us to a crowded end table loaded with goodies: yellow cherries, black\
  \ mushrooms, homemade pickles and sausages, a frosted bottle of Khortytsa vodka.\
  \ Draped across the couch is an array of tightly embroidered fabrics illustrating\
  \ biblical scenes--clearly not rushnyks.\nKateryna smiles proudly, \u201CVery beautiful?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201COh, yes!\u201D My ears flush with embarrassment. Valentyna\u2019s husband\
  \ stoops down and pours the vodka. \n\u201CBudmo!\u201D We clink glasses and put\
  \ them back on the table: Kateryna\u2019s is untouched; mine, empty. Valentyna\u2019\
  s husband throws his arm over my shoulder and guides me to a corner to show off\
  \ his incubator. Kateryna looks on anxiously. Concern is a permanent fixture in\
  \ her eyes.  \n\u201CTo the chickens!\u201D We finish half the bottle. \nKateryna\
  \ gently tugs my elbow and directs my attention back to the embroidery, \u201CWhich\
  \ do you like best?\u201D \nI can\u2019t stop smiling. \u201CThey\u2019re all beautiful\u2026\
  \u201D I choose an embroidered da Vinci\u2019s The Last Supper. Kateryna nods her\
  \ approval. Valentyna pulls the cloth from the couch, folds it gently, and nestles\
  \ it across my drinking arm like a baby. \u201C750 hryvnia.\u201D \nValentyna and\
  \ her husband walk us to the door. A floppy-eared shepherd, baby goats in tow, ambles\
  \ across the drive.  \nKateryna turns toward me, clearly unconcerned, \u201COk?...Let\u2019\
  s go.\u201D"
