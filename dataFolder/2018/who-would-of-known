Text: "The bus slowly pulled into S.Station with my belly rumbling from hunger. It\
  \ is a late, wintery Boston night. The store's on this side of the station are closed.\
  \ So i make my way outside, across the loading platform, to the other terminal.\
  \ Where i proceed to order food.\n After, i see two homeless people sitting at the\
  \ end of a high-rise table. I decide to sit at the other end of them. As i sat there\
  \ i started re-contemplating something that was on my mind earlier. 'The homeless\
  \ epidemic'. \n While on my layover ealier that day at the bus terminal in times\
  \ square i decided to step outside the front doors to smoke a doobie. When i did\
  \ i noticed a young man looking at me, i would soon learn his name was Lamont. Lamont\
  \ looked like a sad puppy dog that was lost. I waved it towards him and he accepted.\
  \ Then just like anytime two strangers blaze together, we formed an instant friendship.\n\
  \ I am a person who believes god puts us places sometimes in life to help others.\
  \ So i gave him a few cigs and a black hoodie that had yellow lettering on the front\
  \ that said GOD OVER MONEY. I knew it wasn't much, but i hoped it would encourage\
  \ him to stay strong and not give up. I didnt want to be any part of the straw that\
  \ broke the camel's back.\n Well wouldnt you know it! The second i handed him that\
  \ hoodie he started crying with gratitude. He told me how minutes before i walked\
  \ into his life and handed him that joint, that he was contemplating about jumping\
  \ off a bridge. We said our goodbyes, then i boarded my bus for Boston.\n Which\
  \ brings us back to S.Station. I wished their was something i could do for the 2\
  \ in front of me. So i prayed, i prayed god would bless their heart's and help them\
  \ like i couldn't.\n Well wouldnt you know it again! Just as the word's came out\
  \ of my mouth, came a young man in his 20's. He was wearing skinny, ripped jeans,\
  \ and a leather jacket. He was pushing a dolly with a couple milk crates, and some\
  \ pizza boxes on it. At the end of the table he stopped at the 2 people i just prayed\
  \ for. First he pulled out water and set one in front of each of them. As he pulled\
  \ out each additional item of food, he would point it at them. They each would shake\
  \ their head's yes, or no. After a few more seconds i then realised the young man\
  \ was a mute.\n I have always believed that actions speak louder than word's but\
  \ this gave it a whole new meaning. Who would of known i'd leave Boston that night\
  \ with a feeling in my heart that no money in the world can buy."
