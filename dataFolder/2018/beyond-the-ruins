Text: "Not long after I watched the sunrise from my seat, the Jordanian heat hit my\
  \ face through the window of the bus. As I leaned my head against the glass, I wiped\
  \ the drips of forehead sweat away with the sleeve of my linen shirt.\n \nIt had\
  \ been four hours since we left Amman. As we pulled up to the entrance of Petra,\
  \ I shook the exhaustion away and lifted my hair into an unflattering ponytail.\n\
  \ \nJust two weeks ago I had been sitting in my room, wondering where I could go\
  \ to escape the daily routines that were uninspiring. Friends and family members\
  \ insisted that I refrain from going to the Middle East, especially alone. It didn\u2019\
  t matter though because I was determined to immerse myself in Arabic culture.\n\
  \ \nVisiting a tourist destination made me wonder if I was cheating. Until I met\
  \ Mohammad.\n \nAs I wiped the lens of my camera, I noticed him walk towards me.\n\
  \ \n\u201CKefik?\u201D He asked.\n \nI became familiar with a few terms during my\
  \ time in Jordan and told him I was doing well. He smirked and responded with, \u201C\
  Not bad for a tourist.\u201D\n \n\u201CMohammad,\u201D he said with pride and lifted\
  \ his hand out. What I learned in the short moments of meeting him, under his wisdom\
  \ and accent, is that many people walk the same paths in Petra; however, not many\
  \ see the ancient city beyond common routes.\n\nThis compelled me to see what he\
  \ meant. I could not refuse his offer to hike. \n\nThe further I climbed, the more\
  \ I wondered why I allowed a stranger to guide me through narrow stones and sharp\
  \ rigid edges. I could taste the dust on the corners of my mouth, and other than\
  \ the blue sky above me, I saw nothing intriguing. Where was I heading? \n\nMohammad\
  \ wrapped his fingers around crumbled red rocks and put them in the palms of his\
  \ hands for me to see. Not only did the open space make room for echoed voices,\
  \ but I could hear the trickle of the rock drip through the cracks of his hand.\
  \ \n\nHe lifted a rock and swiped it across the cheekbones of his face. For a brief\
  \ moment, I felt like Indiana Jones, trekking into an unknown territory.\n \nFrom\
  \ prior research, I discovered that the history of Petra dates back to 312 BC. I\
  \ also knew thousands of Jordanians lived there long ago. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019\
  t know was that Mohammad was leading me to a cave amongst sand and rock. Or as I\
  \ like to call it, a \"little pocket\" in the enormity of Petra that his family\
  \ calls home. As we drew closer, I was welcomed with open arms and traditional hot\
  \ tea. \n\n \u201CWelcome to the real Jordan,\u201D his mother said."
