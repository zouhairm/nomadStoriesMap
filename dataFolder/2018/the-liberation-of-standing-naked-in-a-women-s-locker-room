Text: "My passport, weeks from expiring, looked untouched by time.  The corner of\
  \ it peeked out of the pocket of my windbreaker hanging in the woman\u2019s locker\
  \ room at Blue Lagoon.  A woman undressed next to me and folded her clothes into\
  \ a neighboring locker.  She shared stories about her tattoos and complimented the\
  \ fresh ink healing on my right shoulder. \n\nI watched the women around me, jealous.\
  \  They shamelessly undressed, exposing their bodies to the strangers around them.\
  \  My newly formed acquaintance began to drift away from our conversation and watched\
  \ me stand in front my locker, fully clothed, peering around at the women in the\
  \ room. \n\n\u201CAre you going to change?\u201D  Her question projected her uncertainty\
  \ about me as I stood frozen. \n\nI didn\u2019t quite catch on to what she meant\
  \ until after she walked away to partake in the mandatory bathing before we can\
  \ enter the lagoon waters.  \n\nI was being weird.  The kind of weird that\u2019\
  s awkward and it melts a little into creepy.  My insecurities about my own body\
  \ were prohibiting me from enjoying myself.  The women were fading out of the locker\
  \ room a few at a time as they finished their showers, and I still stood facing\
  \ my locker, looking at the tiny corner of my passport. \n\nWhat the hell am I doing\
  \ here?  I interrogated.  I knew why I was in Iceland; I\u2019ve always wanted to\
  \ go.  Disappointed that I\u2019d never put a stamp in my passport, I bought a ticket\
  \ rather last minute to make that happen before it expired.  I want to do this for\
  \ my life, and yet I can\u2019t find the courage to change into my bathing suit\
  \ let alone take off my socks, in front of a group of women.  \n\nAgain, what the\
  \ hell am I doing here?  If I hadn\u2019t been so absorbed in my own insecurities,\
  \ I would have noticed the amount of women with stretch marks, flabby guts, bald\
  \ spots, scars, and other markers on their bodies showing a little story about how\
  \ they\u2019ve lived.  \n\nI brushed my gaze over nearly every woman in that locker\
  \ room; it started to look as if I was judging them because I wasn\u2019t joining\
  \ them. \n\nI did not come six thousand miles to victimize myself.  \n\nI stared\
  \ my passport straight in the face and stripped down.  I stood naked in the small\
  \ line waiting for the shower, and marched proudly out to the Blue Lagoon wearing\
  \ my tankini.\n\nWhen the lagoon began to close, and I made my way back to the locker\
  \ room, I stripped without hesitation and chatted some more with my locker neighbor.\n\
  \n\u201CHey.\u201D  She laughed at me.  \u201CAre you going to put some clothes\
  \ on?\u201D"
