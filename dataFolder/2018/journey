Text: "I woke up in the tent. I shivered and felt the wind blowing cold. I went out\
  \ and looked around \u2013 I was lost. After dawn, I understood I have to go ahead\
  \ and find a way home. I had enough stocks for next month. However, I had to leave\
  \ it all beside a bottle with water and some food as a heavy bag would trouble me.\n\
  \ Low bushes extended far along the road and mercilessly damaged my knees. My throat\
  \ was dry and I regretted I hadn\u2019t got more water. The tiredness gradually\
  \ passed when a gleam of sunshine found its way down to the road and lighted the\
  \ skyline. The air was full of harmonious bird twittering.\nTummy-rumbling forced\
  \ me to stop and eat a tasty slice of bread. In the distance I noticed a shanty\
  \ and aimed for it. As I approached I saw there was a small town. I came up to one\
  \ of the houses and stayed doubtfully whether I should mount the shaky steps. Thirsty\
  \ forced me enter. \nSorry! Is anyone here?\nI felt impatience but remained immobile.\
  \ I heard someone stepping hastily. A woman came close to me staring in surprise.\
  \ She asked me something but I couldn\u2019t understand her.\nDo you know English?\n\
  The woman called someone. A firm small man came to the doors:\nWhy have you come\
  \ he..?\nI interrupted him:\nI got lost, and found your house. I need water as I\
  \ have no more \nHe looked at me with irritation and said:\nThere are some rules\
  \ in our community. You don\u2019t respect us. We won\u2019t answer on your questions.\n\
  I had had to leave the house but I didn\u2019t go away from the town even every\
  \ one ignored me. In the evening inhabitants gathered. They cooked meat on open\
  \ fire, sang and danced. Like an invisible man, I sat next to amazing sight and\
  \ ate tasteful veal dish. \nNothing changed during the next week. Finally, I relented\
  \ and tried to feel blessings of wild life. Citizens behaved themselves like they\
  \ couldn\u2019t see me, and I tacitly helped them with washing, fishing and hunting.\
  \ Nevertheless, those bold and courageous people inspired me. \nOne day in the morning\
  \ I walked a little narrow path and saw a boy who had climbed a tree to pluck a\
  \ fruit. Suddenly he fell down but I caught him. Honesty terrified the boy descended\
  \ and ran away. It turned out I rescued the chief\u2019s son. I had pleased them\
  \ with respect not only for heroic action but also for all I had done for them.\
  \ They admitted to show me the way home. \nI was grateful for lessons I learned.\
  \ I understood you have to accept moments of being completely lost, and realized\
  \ whenever you go the real adventure is life."
