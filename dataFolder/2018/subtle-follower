Text: "Hmm, the horizon \u2013 what was an arid stretch of brownness along the way\
  \ had melted into the dark, and turned itself into another vast stretch of dark\
  \ and thick moulds of undulating blackness. I could sense it that this was thick\
  \ foliage of a mahogany rain forest but it was still semi-dark with the moon helping\
  \ me to establish the outline of a city still asleep, with buildings and cars that\
  \ ventured to pass the night out of doors. The moon \u2013 where did it spring from?\
  \  I had suddenly chanced upon it \u2013 a naked African boy running in the sky\
  \ alongside our coach. It looked like a lonely child that had wandered all on its\
  \ own throughout the night, and it seemed curious about the little millipede wandering\
  \ around it. Was that a smile on its face? Can even a seemingly well-fed moon smile?\
  \ Yes, indeed it was smiling and seemed to love the company of the little, white\
  \ millipede trying to outrun it.  See, look at them, were they trying to outrun\
  \ each other, the millipede and the moon? But oh, that\u2019s a shame because as\
  \ much as the little millipede tried to inch ahead of the  moon, the moon always\
  \ managed to remain in front of the millipede, a smile of mischief on its face.\
  \ The moon did it as if there was no way in hell that the millipede could ever outrun\
  \ it, but it did it nicely anyway. And sometimes too the moon would sneak off briefly\
  \ into the dark clouds, as if it was doing a peek-a-boo with its new, weeny lovable\
  \ friend the silvery millipede \u2013 yes several times. And at those times that\
  \ it sneaked off into the clouds, I would look around and see that apart from the\
  \ moon, something much more consistent also followed. Unlike the moon, it was a\
  \ little bit more subtle and had followed us all through the journey unseen apparently\
  \ \u2013 from Abuja to Lokoja to Ijebu to Akure to Ibadan and now to the outskirts\
  \ of Lagos. It was everywhere with its power to overwhelm. It put us to sleep, and\
  \ laid a blanket of fear on our brows. It laid a siege on our journey and instead\
  \ of worrying about the bullets and guns, I should have feared it instead. The subtle\
  \ follower was there all through our lives and in our coaches, and perhaps when\
  \ it was time, the eternal struggle between light and darkness ensued. Was that\
  \ what was happening between the clouds and the moon even up there?"
