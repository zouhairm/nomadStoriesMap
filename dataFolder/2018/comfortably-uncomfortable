Text: "My father is the ultimate patriot, a man who loves his country so much, that\
  \ it makes it hard for him to see the value in other cultures. When I tell my family\
  \ I am moving halfway around the world, they cannot understand my desire to do so.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s too risky, you don\u2019t know anyone, why would you want to live\
  \ in another country?\u201D\n\nThe truth is I\u2019m terrified. I\u2019m leaving\
  \ my family, friends, partner, and life I know to live and work in a country with\
  \ strangers. I am filled with self-doubt and fear, and am fighting against everything\
  \ in my head that is telling me to remain comfortable.  After living in Australia\
  \ for six weeks, I am feeling empowered by the decision to do things that scare\
  \ me. This is how I meet a stranger on Facebook and agree to travel in his van,\
  \ the last thing I ever expected.\n\nMarty is a Melbournite, long-haired, big-bearded\
  \ nature photographer. He has a van that he needs to get from Cairns to Sydney,\
  \ a 27-hour drive, and is looking for someone to help split fuel and driving. I\
  \ am in search for an adventure to see the East Coast of Australia via road. \n\n\
  Wallaman Falls is Australia\u2019s tallest single drop waterfall and the first stop\
  \ on our road trip. The hike to the bottom greets us with views that remind me of\
  \ woodland fairy tales I used to imagine as a child. We watch in amazement as thousands\
  \ of gallons of water violently pour down with thunderous sound and turn into nothing\
  \ but rainbow mist by the time they reach the bottom. \n\nOur next stop is Airlie\
  \ Beach, where I meet Gary. Gary has an accent so thick I must intently stare at\
  \ him to follow along, even though we are speaking the same language. He invites\
  \ us to his house to have a beer on the deck overlooking the mountains. We end up\
  \ staying for hours, all of us talking and exchanging stories, and I realize it\
  \ is unlikely I will ever see Gary again. He is a neighbor of a friend of a stranger\
  \ I met on the internet, and yet his kindness and story has impacted me without\
  \ him knowing it. \n\nI appreciate that all of this, the people and places I have\
  \ been fortunate enough to cross paths with, would have never happened if I allowed\
  \ fear to keep me at home. If I had let my parents talk me into remaining stagnant.\
  \ If I hadn\u2019t trusted the universe to allow for a great experience. Security\
  \ and comfortability are nice feelings, but in a world where our time is limited,\
  \ forcing ourselves outside of comfort zones is what makes us feel alive."
