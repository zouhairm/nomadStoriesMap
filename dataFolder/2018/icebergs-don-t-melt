Text: "\u201CThe Iceberg!\u201D screams Chris.  Before you panic\u2026 we\u2019re\
  \ not on the Titanic. Jess and I look up from the apple crisps we are about to have\
  \ and snapped our heads to the right. \n\nMost people thought I was crazy when I\
  \ quit my corporate job in New York to travel on my own but something happens when\
  \ you lose a loved one. It makes you wake up to realize that you don\u2019t want\
  \ to keep saying \u201CSomeday I will\u2026\u201D That\u2019s why I set out on my\
  \ 75 day journey to cross off bucket list items to make someday today; I was hoping\
  \ crossing them off would make me feel alive.\n\nI am in New Zealand because I had\
  \ heard enough about how green and stunning New Zealand is and want to see it for\
  \ myself. The truth is no one can prepare anyone for the bold colors and variety\
  \ of natural scenes and climates here.\n\nI just met Chris and Jess on the Hooker\
  \ Valley Hike. We are sitting at the edge of a milky turquoise glacial lake, with\
  \ a giant glacier on one end, towering waterfalls surrounding us, and this glistening\
  \ ice structure floating in the middle forming two perfect archways. It looks like\
  \ a glass Stonehenge. \n\nI slowly breathe in the sweet crisp air and feel the sun\
  \ wrap around my skin. All my senses are aroused, screaming \u201CMan life is beautiful!\u201D\
  \ I feel small and insignificant as I think about how much longer this mountain\
  \ and Earth has existed than humans. \n\nSuddenly the ice-structure started to break\
  \ off piece by piece and sink. We run to get a closer look. \n\nIn a matter of seconds\
  \ the iceberg fully submerges and disappears under the water; not even leaving a\
  \ hint that it was there. \n\nWe all let out a big sigh, share a moment in silence\
  \ and smile. \u201CHow cool was that? We just witnessed something that no one else\
  \ in this world ever will.\u201D whispered Chris.\n\nIt was then that I realized\
  \ emotions don\u2019t have barriers \u2013 we all felt the same sense of awe and\
  \ connected in that moment. Nothing physical is permanent but that iceberg will\
  \ now last forever in our shared memories. \n\nI completed the most beautiful skydive\
  \ in the world, swung on the largest swing in the world, caved in the largest cave\
  \ system in the world, snowboarded in the blissful powder of Niseko Japan, got PADI\
  \ certified in the Great Barrier Reef and yet this simple moment stood out the most\
  \ to me.\n\nBeing alive isn\u2019t about the big thrill-chasing actions I had set\
  \ out for but it\u2019s about quieting the daily distractions enough to appreciate\
  \ and remember the small miracles that are happening all the time."
