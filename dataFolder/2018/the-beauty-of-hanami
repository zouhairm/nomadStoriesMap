Text: "\"The Japanese people,\" a professor had told us, \"are group-minded. They\
  \ divide the world into their in-group, uchi, and the outside, soto. You here, you\
  \ will never be on the inside.\"\n\nI had spent the day looping around Mount Hakone,\
  \ eating curry and browsing the tacky souvenir shops at Togendai, waiting for my\
  \ pirate ship to sail me back to the Tokaido checkpoint \u2013 the classic Hakone\
  \ experience.\nWhen I disembarked at Hakone-Yumoto that evening it was still early,\
  \ so I dug out my map to explore some more. A little shrine across the river caught\
  \ my eye.\nI set off and was soon in a quiet residential area where tourists didn't\
  \ venture. I checked my map again to see that I was going in the right direction.\
  \ The noise of chatter and laughter made me look up. Just ahead was the shrine,\
  \ and opposite the entrance a group of locals who had set up under a lush pink canopy\
  \ of cherry blossoms. Tarps, blankets, pillows, tables, coolers, grills... this\
  \ was no ordinary picnic!\n\"Oiiii!\" Some of the group had spotted me and were\
  \ waving. I smiled and waved back, about to turn to enter the shrine. \"Kochi, kochi!\"\
  \ Over here! A few people had gotten up and were coming over.\nI gestured behind\
  \ me. \"I came to visit the shrine,\" I pieced together in Japanese.\n\"No, no,\
  \ you need to sit down,\" the middle-aged woman next to me told me, another pulling\
  \ up a chair.\n\"It's okay,\" the grey-haired man beside me said as he shooed me\
  \ towards the group, \"the monk is here with us anyway.\" He pointed to the back\
  \ where a man in dark robes was cheerfully waving at me.\nBefore I knew what was\
  \ happening I was sitting in the middle of the group, chicken skewer in one hand,\
  \ onigiri in the other, a can of Asahi in front of me.\n\"O-sake!\" A young man\
  \ in a business suit handed me a small cup while yet another woman was trying to\
  \ find a way to make me hold a handful of meji chocolates, finally dropping them\
  \ in my lap.\nAfter the initial excitement wore off, we started talking. About Japanese\
  \ car culture and about Schwarzw\xE4lder Kirschtorte. I heard stories from the local\
  \ grocer and the head of the local fire department. He was retiring today. I learned\
  \ that Marilyn Monroe had asked one of them for directions in Tokyo, back in the\
  \ 50s.\nWe would only get interrupted when the next passerby needed to be kidnapped\
  \ into our little gathering. I asked the monk if inviting random strangers wasn't\
  \ a bit unusual. He pointed up to the flurry of blossom above us.\n\"Not today,\"\
  \ he said, \"that is the beauty of Hanami.\""
