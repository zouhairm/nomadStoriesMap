Text: "Our backpacking trip through India did not start in the best of ways as, shortly\
  \ after arriving in New Delhi, my partner and I found ourselves having to dodge\
  \ wave after wave of attempts at conning us into spending money we didn't have.\
  \ After a week of struggling to get anywhere or do anything in the north of India,\
  \ at the end of which we decided it was best to make for the south, we decided to\
  \ abandon the train system and fly from Varanasi to Goa. After doing so, we found\
  \ a little place - not found on the tourist maps - named Bogmalo where we met a\
  \ beach shop owner who approached us very softly in attempt to start a conversation\
  \ that would lead her to selling some of her stock. This was the start of a week\
  \ during which we developed a true friendship with this wonderful person who - once\
  \ we had gotten to know each other better - once asked us, almost in embarrassment,\
  \ what the internet was. \nWe learned of how she had been force to marry her present\
  \ husband - also her cousin - when she was 13 years old and he was 15. How she had\
  \ miscarried her first pregnancy, her body still to young and small, and how her\
  \ mother-in-law had forced her to get pregnant 4 times as her first 2 children had\
  \ been girls and despite the fact that the third had been a boy, she - still not\
  \ satisfied with the number of boys - had called her doctor to cancel her tubal\
  \ ligation so she had had another girl.\nWe also learned of how her own mother had\
  \ tried to suffocate her to death when she was but a baby and how one of her uncles\
  \ had saved her. How she had became a christian without being able to read or write\
  \ and how she had been shunned by her own family and struggled for years with her\
  \ husband because of this.\nMost of all, we learned of how amazingly kind and free\
  \ of judgement and bitterness this woman is even tough her life had been ridden\
  \ with pain, conflict, suffering and the very struggle for survival she faces on\
  \ a day-to-day basis.\nWe were invited to her very humble home and welcomed into\
  \ her family as if we had always been a part of it. We think of her and her strength\
  \ everyday and we hope that what little help and knowledge of the outside world\
  \ we were able to provide her and her family with was enough to bring a fraction\
  \ of the light she brought into our lives, into their own."
