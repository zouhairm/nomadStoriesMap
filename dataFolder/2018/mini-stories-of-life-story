Text: "I arrive 15 minutes early at the pool and start my swim. My master swim coach\
  \ softly provides guidance on what to do for practice. I proceed to follow what\
  \ he writes on the board. After the final workout, I stay a bit longer to swim more\
  \ laps. I cool down then walk to the hot tub. I have been using hot tub lately,\
  \ to take care of a muscle injury.  The jets massage the tightened muscle.  I get\
  \ out.\n\nAs I walked into the locker room, get ready for my shower, I see one last\
  \ swimmer left from master swim, she is finishing up with her makeup standing at\
  \ the mirror.  \n\nShe said, \u201CCan I talk to you for a minute?\u201D\n\nI said,\
  \ \u201CSure.\u201D\n\nShe forcefully said, \u201CWhy do you come in and stay late?\
  \ When you come early, you get ahead of everyone and you don\u2019t say hi to anyone\
  \ when we arrive.\u201D\n\nShe continued bluntly, \u201CYou don\u2019t benefit from\
  \ the extra yards, you know. After a while, it just becomes muscle memory.\u201D\
  \n\nWithout giving me time to answer, she proceeded with a louder voice, \u201C\
  And you didn\u2019t even say thank you for the swim cap I gave you for Christmas.\u201D\
  \ \n\nShe continued, \u201CMaster swim is a team. If you haven\u2019t noticed. And\
  \ you don\u2019t act like you are a part of the team. You don\u2019t need to do\
  \ 4000 yards.\u201D\n\nShe stormed over to her locker, picked up her bags.  \n\n\
  I said, \u201CWait, you didn\u2019t even give me a chance to respond.\u201D\n\n\
  I continue, \u201CI said Thank you for the gift.\u201D \n\nThen, the swimmer proceeded\
  \ to go on about how I said something different than a thank you.\n\nI said, \u201C\
  I\u2019m sorry that you didn\u2019t hear my Thank you.\u201D\n\nShe Then just walked\
  \ out of the locker room.\n\nI stood there, dumbstruck  In the midst of placing\
  \ my suit in the suit drying machine, uncertain what just happened. Holding back\
  \ tears. I look-up and saw an elderly lady getting ready for her swim. She looked\
  \ as if she was in her 70\u2019s.\n\nI said, \u201CGood morning, how are you today?\u201D\
  \n\nShe said, \u201CWell, it was hard getting out of bed this morning.\u201D\n\n\
  I said, \u201CI totally understand. There are days when I don\u2019t feel like getting\
  \ up, but then I do and I\u2019m happy I swam.\u201D\n\n\"I am glad I am here.\u201D\
  \ She stated.\n\nI said, \u201CI am glad you are here too.\u201D\n\nIn the shower\
  \ the warm water hit my face, tears welled up in my eyes.\n\nBringing It All Together\
  \ You will be tested by problem people.A healthy way in dealing with difficult people\
  \ will train you to handle stress more effectively and decrease the likelihood of\
  \ bad effects. This goes for not only in life, but on the course as well.]"
