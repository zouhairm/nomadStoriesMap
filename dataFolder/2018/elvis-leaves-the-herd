Text: "I reached down, and gave Elvis a quick pat on his broad neck. A smile was evident\
  \ on my face, it had been there since the rental car had pulled up at the farm only\
  \ hours before. While on Elvis, I felt like I could do just about anything. I felt\
  \ like I could take on the world. \n\n\u201CAnyone feel like going for a canter?\u201D\
  \ The tour guide asked. \n\nI put the reins in one hand, and put the other hand\
  \ up in the air. I stood up in the stirrups to make myself seem taller. \u201CYes!\
  \ Me!\u201D I eagerly exclaimed. \u201CI have my D+ Certificate at Pony Club!\u201D\
  \ I cockily added on, like it was a big deal. I had cantered before, but that was\
  \ on riding school plodders. \n\nSeeing the world between two ears was a view I\
  \ was no stranger to. I had never ridden a horse in such a breathtaking landscape\
  \ before though, nor had I ever ridden a famous horse. In my naive eyes, a horse\
  \ that was an extra in \u2018The Lord of the Rings\u2019 franchise was, well, a\
  \ famous horse. \n\nMountains surrounded us, snow capped and glistening under the\
  \ winter sunshine. Many of the trees that were visible were bare and lifeless. A\
  \ river, fast flowing and icy, rushed past the graveled shoreline where the sturdy\
  \ trekking horses were standing, patiently.\n\nI rode forward, and followed another\
  \ more experienced rider towards a line of trees that were nearby, towards a trail\
  \ that was almost hidden from the riverbank. She pushed her horse effortlessly into\
  \ a strong canter. \n\nI gave Elvis a light squeeze with my legs, \u201CCome on,\
  \ boy,\u201D I mumbled to the horse, urging him to trot. I rose - up, down, up,\
  \ down - with the bouncy gait, before sitting in the saddle and asking for a canter,\
  \ like I learned at the riding schools.\n\nHis stride changed from a bouncy trot\
  \ into the smoother and faster pace of a canter. For a few strides, everything was\
  \ perfect. Then, the sound of Elvis\u2019 hooves on the ground changed from an even\
  \ beat to a much faster beat. His hooves were matching the beats of my heart, as\
  \ I quickly grasped onto the fact that he was galloping. No, not galloping. Bolting.\
  \ \n\nI desperately grasped onto the mane, and remembered what I had read in that\
  \ one book. Pull, release. Pull, release. I sat up and pulled on his reins for a\
  \ second, before releasing. And again. And again. Until, finally, I slipped off\
  \ the side. \n\nI felt like I was flying while Elvis was bolting out of control\
  \ underneath me. In that split second between my legs leaving the soft, leather\
  \ saddle and me landing awkwardly on the dry, dusty ground, I  was actually flying."
