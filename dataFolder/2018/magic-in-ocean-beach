Text: "One year ago I was snowboarding in Whistler, British Columbia, for my second\
  \ season.  By spring my best friend Burge counted her american tips and the did\
  \ what a reasonable and prudent person would do with a wad of american cash. She\
  \ flew down to Ocean Beach, SD to volunteer at a hostel. Things were going pretty\
  \ good for me at the time. I had my frontside board slide down pat and I was enrolled\
  \ in college in the fall for an outdoor adventure program. I was also in a loving\
  \ relationship. But when that suddenly burned to the ground I felt a little lost,\
  \ for like, a second. Burge hooked me up with a Skype interview with her boss and\
  \ one week later I was on an airplane Southern California. Some hours later I was\
  \ walking down the sidewalk of this little beach town and as I I write this I can\
  \ clearly picture how I viewed this place for the first time. A bar sign read $2\
  \ Tacos and $3 Sculpin. My dad is a fisherman, and I thought \u201CWOW! They eat\
  \ sculpin here?\" If you don\u2019t know what a sculpin is, it is about the ugliest\
  \ fish imaginable and it\u2019s spines are poisonous.  I ordered one the next week\
  \ and when a bartender slammed a pint of beer down in front of me I told him I didn\u2019\
  t order it, before realizing Sculpin is also the name of a local IPA. The hostel\
  \ was easy to recognize because it is the only building on the street that is covered\
  \ in murals and has a peace sign on the top. I came during one of their bi-weekly\
  \ BBQ\u2019s on the patio in the back. It was booming with life! The patio is open\
  \ with picnic tables and comfortable chairs full of people sharing stories, music,\
  \ and love. There is a bar in the back where the BBQ was set up, I was given a beer\
  \ and a veggie burger and adapted to my new surroundings. I made a friend on the\
  \ pier named Kioke. He is a shark fisherman and would use wine corks on his line,\
  \ so I would save all the wine corks from the hostel and bring them to him. After\
  \ a tragic accident in which his nephew was shot, I shampooed, brushed, and braided\
  \ his hair so he would look presentable for the funeral. It was a 3 day, 16 hour\
  \ job. He will be forever grateful and it\u2019s good to have a man like him in\
  \ your corner. I spent my summer guiding coastal cycling tours, sunset cliffs walking\
  \ tours, BBQ\u2019s  bon fires and making lifelong friendships with travellers and\
  \ locals alike. I became a local that summer, making friends with everyone from\
  \ the homeless, the fisherman, and small business owners. It was such a beautiful\
  \ place that I am going back. In 2 hours."
