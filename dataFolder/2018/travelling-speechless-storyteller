Text: "I woke up on my birthday to a crisp morning in M\xE1laga, uncertain as to what\
  \ I might discover on my spontaneous day-trip to Ronda. On my own, approximately\
  \ 11 000 kilometres away from family and friends, in a foreign country, I was searching\
  \ for meaning to my heart-broken question of \u201Cpurpose\u201D. My journey to\
  \ this point is a story for another day.\n\nThis mountaintop city is dramatically\
  \ set above a deep canyon, the El Tajo, which separates the city\u2019s old town\
  \ from its new town \u2013 past and future \u2013 linked by a sturdy and steadfast\
  \ stone bridge called the Puente Nuevo. Underneath, the Guadalev\xEDn river runs\
  \ through the city, carving out this deep gorge which goes beyond my comprehension.\
  \ It stands in its natural beauty, sheer force and magnitude. I am speechless.\n\
  \nThough my mind struggles to grasp what my eyes were beholding, my feet seemed\
  \ to be comfortable, light and inquisitive. I would agree that Ronda is as the Andalusian\
  \ name suggests, \u201Cto walk easy\u201D. I left the old town behind and embraced\
  \ what was ahead, the new. My feet wandered by their own compass, strolling through\
  \ an era of Hispano-Moorish tradition inspired autumn gardens. This was the House\
  \ of the Moorish King \u2013 ceramic features, vines trailing over colonnades, flower\
  \ beds, steps and terracotta paving \u2013 the infamous Forestier\u2019s hanging\
  \ Gardens. The royal blue and kind white of the tiles together with the awakening\
  \ green of carefully chosen plants made the peacock seem to be artistically placed\
  \ for me to be able to capture this moment of creative vision. I was enjoying my\
  \ 14th century exploration to an unexpected secret water mine.\n\n231 wide, rock-carved\
  \ steps lead downwards in a zigzag pattern to the river.  This was the present where\
  \ the air was moist, cool and quiet. The ingenius system of overlapping vaults added\
  \ to the mystery of the adventure and with each thoughtful step 80m descending,\
  \ my anticipation welled. Finally, I was struck by \u201Cgorgeousness\u201D.\n\n\
  My eyes took a while to adjust from the clammy, dark grotto to the soft light outside.\
  \  In front of me was a steep, grey-brown, solid rockface gently hugging what seemed\
  \ to be an infinite, turquoise, transparent aquatic.  I sat down in the moment,\
  \ breathing in this special view and attending to the playful echoes of birds above.\
  \ Peacefulness. This was the present and the experience spoke words to my wild and\
  \ boundless heart.\n\nRONDA \u2013 Romantic in your essence; Obvious in your nature;\
  \ Notable in your magic; Dynamic in your presence; Appreciated."
