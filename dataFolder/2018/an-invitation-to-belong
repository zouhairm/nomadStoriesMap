Text: "\"Try it, pruebalo!\" he said, with a hint of frustration. He pushed the fork\
  \ closer to my mouth. \n\nI hesitated and glanced hopefully around the room for\
  \ support. Nothing. Instead, the women who were gathered around the prepared table\
  \ littered with salads, loaves of bread and wine, stared back, silently urging me\
  \ to accept the honour. \n\nThe asado tradition had originated years ago from the\
  \ Argentine Gauchos and what had started as a tradition had evolved into a religion\
  \ of sorts. The cooking methods passed from generation to generation had become\
  \ its beliefs and its parrilla or grill, the shrine.  I was to be its next disciple.\
  \ \n\nThe asado was a great leveler of social class in Argentina. Wealth, social\
  \ standing, age, job title, none of that mattered here. In a country where the divide\
  \ between rich and poor had widened, the asado humbled everyone.  An invitation\
  \ to an asado, was an invitation to their tribe and to belong. You didn't turn it\
  \ down.   \n\nThe roles were clear in the asado preparation which closely mimicked\
  \ the wider roles in society. The women gathered together in the small kitchen,\
  \ cackling, gossiping and preparing the accompaniments.  The air filled with a thousand\
  \ conversations punctured with laughter.\n\nThe men gathered around the parrilla\
  \ - a red brick chimney scarred with the ashes of asados been. In the middle of\
  \ the chimney, a simple stainless steel grill. The altar on which the meat would\
  \ be placed. The wood for the fire, which had been painstakingly chosen for its\
  \ flavour, stacked carefully in one corner of the chimney. \n\n\"We cook with heat,\
  \ not with fire\", muttered the chief Asador to me, lighting the coals gently. Immediately,\
  \ the sweet scent of pine filled the room. As the meat cooked, the smell of the\
  \ salts and fats enveloped the room.\n\nThree hours later,  it was ready.\n\nThe\
  \ searing hot salted meat was placed gingerly on a tray, the Asador parading it\
  \ proudly to the table. The women hastily clearing space on the table. \n\nThat's\
  \ where I found myself now. \n\n\"What is it?\" I asked with suspicion.\n\nIgnoring\
  \ my question he replied, suppressing a smile, \"It's a tradition for all foreigners\
  \ to eat the first meat of the asado.\" \n\nI closed my eyes and tasted the saltiness\
  \ of the meat. I chewed and with every chew, I realised what I was eating. Pig's\
  \ ear. I hid the urge to retch.\n\nI opened my eyes. The Asador was buckled over\
  \ in laughter, his eyes wet with tears. \n\n\"It's not a tradition at all \" he\
  \ explained. \"But, you're of one us now\"."
