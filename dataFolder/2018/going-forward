Text: "I sat in the darkness of a wet winter bus in a seat where the light filtered\
  \ grey and damp through the window's stained glass and the world on the other side\
  \ formed a picture of the most perfect nothing.\n\nI looked at my fellow passengers,\
  \ their heads bowed in surrender, abject and unconditional, each face lit from beneath\
  \ by the glow of a device, personal campfires holding back the darkness.\n\nMy Great\
  \ Aunt Madge used to tell me stories on cold nights - fairy tales, myths, legends\
  \ and a nod to an Ireland she\u2019d left behind in 1918. \n\nOf Africa, hot and\
  \ bright and made of noise and adventure.  No heart of darkness for Madge. Of lands\
  \ where furred creatures laid eggs and carried their babies in their pockets. A\
  \ giant ocean at the bottom of the world where the wind roared and the waves reared\
  \ sixty feet above your head.\n\nMagic carpet rides flew us around the world while\
  \ we kept warm by the fire in my grandmother\u2019s house where Madge had lived\
  \ since her Daniel had been taken from her, felled by a stroke getting off a bus.\
  \ He\u2019d been 53. \n\nI got off the bus and walked to work.\n\nThe first meeting\
  \ of the day was to \u201Cmetastorm in the thoughtspace to gain some velocity on\
  \ the silo reduction\u201D... Or whatever.\n\nA watershed is defined by the OED\
  \ as \u201CAn area or ridge of land that separates waters flowing to different rivers,\
  \ basins, or seas.\u201D or \u201CAn event or period marking a turning point in\
  \ a situation.\u201D\n\nA crumb of fat lodges in the wall of an artery; a thoughtless\
  \ comment sends love upstairs to pack its suitcase and book the next flight; a mobile\
  \ phone rings in the cab of a moving lorry; a gaze is held a moment too long and\
  \ a heart is lost forever.\n\nSo, on that winter morning with its stiletto wind\
  \ and freezing rain and ice-pick sunshine, in that maelstrom of linguistic despair,\
  \ I heard the phrase \u201Cgoing forward\u201D once too often.\n\nI went to Barcelona.\
  \ My wife drove me to the station at 4am. Washed my feet in the sea in winter; long\
  \ walks; food heaven at La Boqueria; a post office like a cathedral and a cathedral\
  \ like nothing on Earth. Nature inspired Gaudi on his own long walks. Sitting between\
  \ the mountains and the sea, Barcelona is a city close to nature. \n\nAmong such\
  \ things in a packed weekend we drank the perfect number of cocktails (one too many)\
  \ and talked the night away in the gracious and patient company of my goddaughter\
  \ and no better companion could be wished for or found.\n\nThe only decisions we\
  \ make are changes of direction.  Change direction when you need to."
