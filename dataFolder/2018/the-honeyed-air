Text: "Walking past a sports equipment shop, the last thing you expect to see inside\
  \ is a plethora of paintings hanging on the grey, unplastered walls and unfinished\
  \ works spread all across the dingy, lumpy floor of a twenty-five square metre,\
  \ dimly lit, claustrophobic shop. I was not even done swooning over Ashok\u2019\
  s prowess of rendering the nature on canvas when he declared that he wants to show\
  \ us around his village, Rohna, situated in the heart of Sonipat, Haryana. His eyes\
  \ lit up when he talked about the jaggery manufacturing unit that has been a major\
  \ source of income for his family for generations, in addition to his new found\
  \ love for painting. As I took the position of the pillion, I felt the one-hundred-sixty\
  \ cc engine roaring between my legs. It\u2019s been ten minutes since we left the\
  \ pseudo-town of Kharkhoda behind us and I find my locks flamboyantly flowing in\
  \ the soft, grainy winds of Rohna. With an expanse of agricultural land on both\
  \ sides of the narrow road, crops ranging from towers of wheat, cushioning my eyes\
  \ from the scorching sun on one side and sweeps of flooded paddy on the other. I\
  \ could taste the sweet aroma of running sugar before I could spot the smoking chimney\
  \ that produced it. As we closed in on the site, there was no factory; just three\
  \ pits, with a diameter of around six feet and a sugarcane crushing machine, turning\
  \ the rigid sticks into an alluring pit of saccharine joy. A dozen people producing\
  \ hundreds of kilos of jaggery a day, making sure that no drop of sweat trailing\
  \ their eyebrow led to the adulteration of the produce. The waste from the crushing\
  \ process acted as the fuel that kept that the furnace burning. As I stood there,\
  \ one of the guys in the plant spoke in Hindi, \u201Cbrother, have some,\u201D and\
  \ poured a big spoonful of golden, semi-liquid jaggery in my hand. As I rested a\
  \ small chunk of it on my tongue, I felt the volatility and heavenliness at the\
  \ same time. Sensing a faint, involuntary smile on my face, the workers merrily\
  \ gave me half-a-kilo of jaggery to take with me. As we greeted everyone and left\
  \ for the temple where half-a-dozen of Ashok\u2019s paintings are installed, I asked\
  \ him for directions for the same. He replied, \u201Cjust follow the sound of the\
  \ bells,\u201D and with that occupied the pillion seat, leaving me to steer ahead.\
  \ As I slithered on the petite leather seat and revved up the engine, I heard three\
  \ continuous bells from the north. I wore the helmet and put the motorbike in motion\
  \ towards the genesis of the sound."
