Text: "When I visit a new country, I like to try something I can't try in the UK.\
  \ In Jordan, I decided to try a traditional Hammam bath - and by \"traditional\"\
  , I mean naked. As a westerner, letting a stranger wash my naked body is just not\
  \ normal. So although I\u2019d visited Arabic countries that offered the service,\
  \ I\u2019d never plucked up the courage to try it, put off by horror stories of\
  \ creepy men and wandering hands. That was until I made friends with a non-creepy,\
  \ non-handsy local man in Amman, who's girlfriend worked in a public Hammam.\n\n\
  Diane and I were introduced the next day. She tried to explain the service she offered,\
  \ apologising for her broken English. But language wasn\u2019t a blocker between\
  \ us - it even resulted in a few giggles as Diane mentioned covering my body in\
  \ \"Moroccan soup\". It was the beginning of a friendship, and the way I saw it,\
  \ getting semi-naked and being washed by a friend was less daunting than getting\
  \ fully naked and being washed by a total stranger. So I agreed to a private Hammam\
  \ session with Diane.\n\nAfter stripping down to my pants and wrapping in a towel,\
  \ I came out from behind a screen to find Diane was also bare. Her hijab was off\
  \ and her hair hung over her shoulders, a towel pulled around her body too. I hadn\u2019\
  t realised there would be so much flesh on show between us. Diane wasn't fazed though.\
  \ Instead she handed me some sandals and led me towards the sauna door. Because\
  \ it was a private Hammam, I assumed I'd be on my own in the sauna for the allotted\
  \ 20 minutes. But as Diane ushered me in and plonked down next to me, I realised\
  \ I was wrong. We sat in the hot room sweating in silence for a moment, then began\
  \ to chat. She told me about working in the Hammam in Amman, and how she\u2019d\
  \ previously worked in spas in her home country of Syria. Until she'd had to leave\
  \ Syria for safety. Because she, her sons and her mother had to flee after her father\
  \ and husband were shot dead. My heart bled; but she forced a smile and told me\
  \ not to be sad for her. She was just happy that her children were safe.\n\nWe were\
  \ so deep in conversation that neither of us noticed that 20 minutes had passed.\
  \ Our bodies glowed red, glistening from the sweat dripping off us, but still we\
  \ sat there talking about our pasts and our present, our hopes and goals for the\
  \ future and the differences between our two countries. It was clear that we came\
  \ from two completely separate worlds, but at that moment, in that sauna in Amman,\
  \ we were the best of friends. I was humbled."
