Text: "He was sitting on a bench hunched over a route map when we spotted him. Mrudula\
  \ and I were late, having clearly underestimated the time it would take to complete\
  \ the horseshoe ridge walk to reach Pen-y-Fan peak and back on this rainy, foggy\
  \ day in Brecon Beacons National Park. After starting late and having made two round\
  \ trips in search of the car park from where to start our trek, we finally decided\
  \ to approach this bloke to end our misery and get started with our climb. I was\
  \ clearly in a hurry and don't remember much of him from this first interaction.\
  \ \n\nBut a couple of hours into our trek, when we decided to sit down and take\
  \ a quick snack break, we found him trudging along the same path, carrying his super\
  \ heavy rucksack. It was his bag that caught my attention this time. We smiled at\
  \ him, a habit we picked up from the generous smiles strangers exchange in the mountains\
  \ since we started trekking. He paused, waved, asked if we are doing ok and then\
  \ carried on. Within no time, we started on our path and got lost in the mountains\
  \ once again. This was a minor setback though, and we retraced our steps to the\
  \ same spot. We were not carrying any compass or maps and there was no way for us\
  \ to know the right direction in this foggy weather except by looking for familiar\
  \ faces going in the same direction. This time too he came to our rescue, unknowingly\
  \ though, as we managed to spot his rucksack and him. \n\nFor a 5 footer like me,\
  \ Justin came across as a huge guy, well built and super strong. Only after we started\
  \ speaking to him that we got to see his child like innocence and dreams. We spurred\
  \ each other on to climb the last leg of Jacob's ladder; he was so excited to know\
  \ that we come from India, the land of Himalayas. For someone born in UK, where\
  \ the highest mountains are merely 1500 m high, Justin nurtured the dream of someday\
  \ climbing the Everest. The more we spoke the more we exchanged stories of trekking\
  \ in UK and India. He told us about all the peaks in Brecon Beacon; it turned out\
  \ he was a construction contractor during the week and an explorer during the weekends.\
  \ He would camp in his caravan in one or the other national park of Wales and carry\
  \ this heavy rucksack all around to keep himself physically fit, for you never know\
  \ when life would throw up an opportunity to climb Everest. And when it does, you\
  \ want to be ready. As we made our way down back to the car park, he came to us\
  \ with these pretty hand made gifts to remember this friendship and Justin remains\
  \ etched in our memories forever."
