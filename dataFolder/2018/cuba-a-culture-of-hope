Text: "While only 90 miles separates Cuba from our closest US border in Florida, the\
  \ ideology that divides the 2 nations are worlds apart. Aside from a little extra\
  \ questioning in the airport regarding the nature of my visit and what camera or\
  \ recording equipment I had with me, I felt very welcome in this warm culture and\
  \ climate.\nStepping from the airport, you're instantly transported back 60 years\
  \ or so it seemed as cars from an era gone by here at home are happily buzzing on\
  \ the roads in Havana. The rounded shapes of the 50\u2019s era cars are a popular\
  \ image of the Cuban culture, but more so a visual reminder of the resilience of\
  \ the Cuban people. \nImagine a place where the part you need to replace in your\
  \ engine is no longer fabricated, thus no longer exists. In a society, where we\
  \ download and click to have something shipped same day delivery, it\u2019s a very\
  \ foreign notion for the populace to create the part you need. But in Cuba, you\u2019\
  d do just that; take a piece of metal and grind and weld and drill and shine until\
  \ you can put the engine together again. It is this ingenuity and make do attitude\
  \ that demonstrate the soul of the Cuban people. However, I\u2019d be remiss to\
  \ not point out that this ingenuity is born of necessity. \nSo while the black smoke\
  \ that arises from the exhaust of these countless vehicles gives note not only for\
  \ the necessity of the catalytic converter, but also the dark cloud that hovers\
  \ over Cuba\u2019s economy and social structure.\nSigns of political propaganda\
  \ and Ernesto \u201CChe\u201D Guevara are in no short supply in Havana. Nor are\
  \ the signs of poverty and neglect. A dichotomy clearly exists. Fine hotels cater\
  \ to tourists from around the world, because while there is a US embargo, there\
  \ is no such restriction for other countries throughout Europe or Canada. There\
  \ are some examples of beautiful, well-maintained homes as well, but a large portion\
  \ of Havana is shared by the people who struggle day to day. \nSpeaking to the people\
  \ on the street you soon learn that there is a sub-economy. Not only is there is\
  \ a blatant difference between the local and the foreign price for goods; doctors\
  \ may earn the same as teachers on the government payroll. Many people have a \u201C\
  side hustle\u201D and after completing their government duty, they may earn twice\
  \ as much driving a taxi on the weekends shuttling around those tourists. \nCubans\
  \ are a people of art and music and dance! There is a vibrancy to the streets of\
  \ Havana despite the challenges faced daily. It is a culture of hope."
