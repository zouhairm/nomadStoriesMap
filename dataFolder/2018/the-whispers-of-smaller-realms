Text: "South America is a harsh and unpredictable place, drenched in natural beauty,\
  \ epic cultural history and the warmth of down to earth people. I've been to many\
  \ cities but smaller, quieter places woo me to explore and learn. I often wonder\
  \ if the universe is trying to tell me something.\nI\u2019m in Bolivia headed to\
  \ Las Islas Flotantes. Some 45 minutes from Puno, my boat carves its way through\
  \ tall reeds revealing the golden islands before us. They are bunched together in\
  \ a small area of Lake Titicaca. Everything is made of straw \u2013 the floor, huts,\
  \ beds, even the boats!\nTotora grows in abundance here. They carve its roots into\
  \ cubes and tie them together with rope, making a platform that floats. Anchoring\
  \ it to the lakebed 16 metres below, they blanket the floor in straw creating a\
  \ soft mat.\nEach island has it\u2019s own President dealing with daily maintenance.\
  \ This one has a small pond carved in the middle and 32 people of the same family\
  \ living on it. There is no law or police, so if you don\u2019t get along with someone,\
  \ you carve up your island, float away and anchor somewhere else.\nThe Uros people\
  \ are very welcoming, opening their hearts as freely as their homes. Smiling, laughing\
  \ and serenading us with traditional songs, we float away on their baronial straw\
  \ boats. It\u2019s a unique experience you\u2019ll not find anywhere else.\nBy contrast\
  \ are the pre-Incan cemeteries at Sillustani. Located on Lake Umayo, the Colla people\
  \ would bury their nobility here, in tower like structures made of meticulously\
  \ carved stone called Chullpas. The stones sourced up to 300km away, were layered\
  \ like a cake and lean against each other to avoid collapse.\nWhen a father died,\
  \ he would be laid to rest in the open base of a pyre. Those deemed closest to him\
  \ were killed and entombed in other open crevices. With the natural cold and sunlight\
  \ peaking through, the bodies would mummify.\nThe Colla\u2019s believed water was\
  \ the giver of all life and the healing powers of the sun would rejuvenate the body\
  \ and rise from the dead. Located on a peninsular surrounded by sun and water created\
  \ the best possible conditions for resurrection.\nIt is a marvel of engineering\
  \ and cultural spirit that forged these structures \u2013 the adroit venture of\
  \ living on water and the monuments to life, death and resurrection. Bolivia is\
  \ a land born of the affirmation of life through death; through cultivation, rejuvenation\
  \ and resurrection. It\u2019s a tranquil place with an intriguing past where the\
  \ universe is always telling you something."
