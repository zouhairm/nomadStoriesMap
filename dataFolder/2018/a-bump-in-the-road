Text: "The sky was exceptionally blue. Then again, I was hours outside the smog screen\
  \ of China's capital. All around me, rolling hills boasted crumbled remnants of\
  \ the Great Wall. I was snapped out of my heaven-ward trance by the approaching\
  \ sound of tires crunching over gravel.\n\"The bus is coming,\" said my coworker\
  \ in Chinese, out of breath after pedaling me on the back of his bicycle a mile\
  \ from our summer camp to the bus stop. He quickly spouted off directions back to\
  \ Beijing, waved goodbye, and raced back up the road. As I frantically sifted through\
  \ his instructions, my mind still processing the fragments in Mandarin, the bus\
  \ screeched to a halt in front of me. \nAll conversations ceased as I made my way\
  \ down the crowded aisle. Being so far into the countryside, and by the look of\
  \ the passengers\u2019 awestruck expressions, I imagine I was the first blonde-haired,\
  \ blue-eyed individual they had ever seen in person. A hand shot up at the back\
  \ of the bus. It belonged to a middle-aged woman, smiling and gesturing to me that\
  \ there was an open seat next to her.\nShe beamed at me, her eyes studying the features\
  \ of my face. Before I could sit down, her questions began in rapid-fire Chinese.\
  \ \u201CWhere are you from? What do you do? Are you married? Why not? Do you have\
  \ kids? Why not?\u201D She absentmindedly began playing with my hair, taking long\
  \ strands between her fingers and studying the color and texture as the bus thumped\
  \ along. It wasn\u2019t until she asked where I was going that I remembered I had\
  \ no clue where the bus was taking me. \n\u201CDo you know how to get to Beijing?\u201D\
  \ I asked. She shook her head no, still twisting my hair in her hands. A gentleman\
  \ in front of me turned in his seat and in a reassuring voice, instructed me on\
  \ how to get home. As I thanked him, the bus suddenly tilted to the right, then\
  \ to the left, and then sharply dipped back to the right until we were sitting at\
  \ a 30 degree angle, the engine stalling.\nEveryone rushed to the right side of\
  \ the bus, turning the 30 degree slant into a dizzying 45 degrees. We all peered\
  \ out the windows at the tires, sunken deep into red clay. All eyes fell on me again,\
  \ waiting for my reaction. I gave a quick \u201CI guess we\u2019re stuck here for\
  \ a while\u201D shrug, and everyone chuckled a sigh of relief, as if accepting my\
  \ invitation to share this minor misfortune together. After all, I now knew the\
  \ way home, and as I looked at the faces on the bus, at the opportunities to share\
  \ new stories and ideas, I was no longer in a hurry to get there."
