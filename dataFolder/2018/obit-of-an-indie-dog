Text: "13 years of togetherness came to a tragic end when Chindi walked away one day,\
  \ without bidding  adieu. While loss helps us appreciate what we had, losing her\
  \ was a big price to pay. I still struggle with the guilt of her going perhaps on\
  \ the back of a garbage truck! Sadness is engulfing! \n\nMy kids knew all about\
  \ my street dog, Chindi and had seen me desolate. For our class assembly, when I\
  \ suggested we mime the story of Hachi, Japan's symbol of loyalty, they screamed\
  \ \"YES\" in unison.  For 9 years, he waited for Professor Ueno outside Tokyo\u2019\
  s Shibuya Station, unaware that his master had died at work and was never returning.\
  \ Hachi's grief resonated with me.\n\nSeeing clips of my skit, a Japanese friend\
  \ invited me to Japan. What was meant to be a way of running away from my agony,\
  \ became my way home. Japan became a pilgrimage!\n\nMy first destination was the\
  \ famed statue outside Shibuya Station. My heart started pacing as if meeting a\
  \ long lost love! The spot where he awaited had a plaque narrating his story. I\
  \ froze and tears welled up in my eyes as I touched the coldness of the metal. While\
  \ I was having my picture taken, someone shouted it was Hachi's birthday! This was\
  \ no coincidence!\n\nNext I went to The National Museum of Nature and Science which\
  \ has the actual stuffed body of Hachi. I stood before \u2018HIM\u2019; his tail\
  \ curled, standing majestic in his harness, picturing him afraid and lonely in the\
  \ cold climes of Japan.\n\nAt The University of Tokyo stands a statue of Hachi and\
  \ the Professor, reunited up in heaven. When I reached the gate, I excitedly said\
  \ just Hachi to the smiling, elderly guard. He led me in, his hand around my shoulder\
  \ as if he already knew that I may need his fatherly reassurance. I quietly bowed,\
  \ mouthing \u201CArigato\u201D as tears choked me. I circled around, eyeing them\
  \ both as if to make a permanent imprint in my heart. \n\nHachiko\u2019s cremated\
  \ remains lie buried next to his master's in \"Aoyama Reien\". How was I to find\
  \ my way in this maze of tombstones with Japanese inscriptions? Almost like a God\
  \ sent, a suited gentleman led me there. I was mesmerised by the main cemetery\u2019\
  s narrow roads and beautiful tombstones cocooned in the vibrant colours of fall.\
  \ I sat at the foot of his grave, for what seemed like eons. For the first time\
  \ in months, my head didn\u2019t feel in a tangle.\n\nJapan has left an indelible\
  \ mark on my heart - a sense of longing and emptiness. A past life connection, perhaps!"
