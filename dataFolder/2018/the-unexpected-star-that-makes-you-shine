Text: "You were in Los Angeles, California, wearing clothes of a 19 year old guy who\
  \ traveled a long way to get there. You made it. You were in the city that you wanted\
  \ to be in, watching at the palm trees dance with the rhythm of the summer breeze\
  \ in a clear blue sky. Mother nature is such a great composer.\n\nYou were living\
  \ a very sad phase in that time. You lost weight in an almost scary way because\
  \ you were barely eating, and you were more sleep than awake. However, you finally\
  \ decided to stand up and move on. You put a pair of shoes on, wash your face and\
  \ go out to discover a new place, a place that made you happy, curious, excited.\n\
  \nYou closed your eyes and decided to go to the first place that came to your mind.\
  \ Rodeo Drive was the place, this iconic street full of high fashion and pieces\
  \ of art known worldwide. \n\nYou walked into the stores, looking at evening gowns\
  \ and dresses that are draped in dramatic ways. It is amazing the art that humans\
  \ can make when they love what they are doing.\n\nSeveral hours were spent walking\
  \ around these stores. You felt that you discovered a new world with all the materials,\
  \ shapes and objects that your eyes were skimming in the racks. Any place can be\
  \ observed as a museum if you look at it from the right perspective.\n\nIt was time\
  \ for you to go back. But wait, didn\u2019t you see a delicious iced coffee with\
  \ chips and cream advertised somewhere? In the fourth floor maybe. It was not on\
  \ the way out but it seemed like a good way to conclude a nice day. \n\nYou took\
  \ the electric stairs to get there, conscious of how you were going up without doing\
  \ any movement. Why isn\u2019t life always this easy?\n\nYou walked across the shoe\
  \ department, which was as breathtaking as everything you saw that day. There was\
  \ a blonde woman with big sunglasses sitting down. Where have you seen that woman?\
  \ Where did you see that comic and iconic facial gesture? \nWas that your favorite\
  \ singer? The one that you have been following for so many years and inspired you\
  \ to overcome struggles in your life?\n\u201CYes, it is me\u201D, she said smiling.\
  \ \nShe was waiting for her husband who was shopping, she had no rush so she asked\
  \ you to sit down and talk in that iconic store in Los Angeles. You talked about\
  \ life, songs, your career, your experience in California. All of the things that\
  \ you wanted to share with her, were shared in such an unexpected way.\n\nA travel\
  \ experience doesn\u2019t require a plane ticket, as long as you are willing to\
  \ take the ride to a new experience. \n."
