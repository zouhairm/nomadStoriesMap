Text: "Originally, I wanted to move to Italy or Spain but I landed in Switzerland.\
  \ Nothing prepared me for Swiss German and learning was proving to be elusive. My\
  \ Swiss friends spoke to me in English but when they came together, my lack of skills\
  \ was forgotten. We were heading to the mountains for skiing/snowboarding. I was\
  \ excited but a little worn out already trying to follow the rhythm of conversation.\
  \ A friend waved me over. Apparently, we had a stowaway that had joined for the\
  \ ride. I was informed that he was Canadian/Swiss and liked speaking English. Well,\
  \ it was Canadian English but I  \nwas not picky. I jumped down next to him showing\
  \ him my blinding smile and my Afro hair that was big enough to introduce itself.\
  \ Adam\xB4s eyes grew just as big and looked like he would have run away. His closed\
  \ looks might have run off a less persistent person but I refused to be persuaded.\
  \ I peppered him with a rapid fire of questions and when we arrived I knew enough\
  \ of his early years.\nAdam knew the way for a somewhat easy run. My questions stopped\
  \ as I was mesmerized by the view going up the lift. The air tasted like breathing\
  \ in a cough drop and the snow twinkled. We ran into a couple that spoke English\
  \ and shared a laugh at being the odd ones out. My elation quickly fled as we reached\
  \ the top. His easy run turned out to be a black diamond which is for experts. I\
  \ am sure there are little skull and crossbones signs posted. My heart sunk. This\
  \ was the second time that I had been on skis. Pictures of my legs skiing down in\
  \ opposite ways kept bombarding my mind. The snow that I had just found breathtaking\
  \ was now blaring at me and stealing my breaths in a different way. It came out\
  \ in short gasps as I tried not to hyperventilate. However, my pride refused to\
  \ go back in the lift. To say I was sweating and had chills at the same time was\
  \ an understatement as I peered down the sheer cliffs on either side- no rolling\
  \ hills. I ended up getting down by crashing into the other guy in the group. Yes,\
  \ I do mean literally I would plow into him. We would both go tumbling into the\
  \ snow then we repeated the process in close range so that I did not send us both\
  \ over the edge. Somehow, I made it down in one piece in time for lunch. Apparently,\
  \ this is what was needed to melt the ice off of Adam and we continued with a mutual\
  \ happy conversation. There is nothing like a near death experience to start a great\
  \ friendship. Sometimes the least expected moments are what memories are made of."
