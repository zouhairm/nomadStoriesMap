Text: "It was the last thing I'd expected.  I didn't expect to be the main attraction,\
  \ the star of the occasion. \nIt was my birthday, and as a treat to myself, I\u2019\
  d gone on holiday to Thailand. Thailand was the first non-Western country I'd visited.\
  \ At that time, I hadn't even been to Eastern Europe.  \n\nI spent most of the time\
  \ in Phuket, where they are used to tourists from many different places. I had a\
  \ great time, enjoying the beaches and food and making friends with locals. I felt\
  \ at home in Phuket, since the climate and geography are like my home country. \n\
  \nOne of my new friends invited me to go with her to her home village, near Surat\
  \ Thani, and meet her family. This was a great opportunity for me to venture away\
  \ from Phuket - off the beaten path, where tourists don't usually venture. It was\
  \ a chance to see \u2018the real Thailand\u2019.  \n\nThis is the kind of encounter\
  \ I seek when I travel \u2013 a chance to witness how normal folk live; a chance\
  \ to engage with people in the less-than-sterilised environments that are normally\
  \ created for tourist. I'm also keen to try local foods prepared in the traditional\
  \ way. I'm less interested in restaurant preparations, and want to sample the real\
  \ cuisine of the place - what I call 'folk food'. \n\nI caused quite a stir when\
  \ I arrived in the village. The first thing I noticed was that there were lots of\
  \ people (especially children) at my hosts' house when I arrived. I wasn't sure\
  \ who they were or how many of them were my friend's relatives. People in this village\
  \ live quite simply - poor by western standards. However, they are very hospitable.\
  \ The women spent many hours cooking and preparing a feast for us (making sure that\
  \ I had less spicy dishes) \u2013 a great variety of traditional Thai foods using\
  \ fresh, local ingredients. \n\nWhile the women were cooking, I visited a nearby\
  \ park called Ratchaprapha - the site of a dam and hydroelectrical power station.\
  \ The surroundings were beautiful with great views of the lake and the dam. \n\n\
  I was later told that no black person had ever visited the village before and that\
  \ many of the villagers had never seen a black person apart from on television.\
  \ So, the visitors were there for the novel experience. The people in that region\
  \ have dark skin \u2013 some even darker than I am. But me being 'African' was what\
  \ differentiated me and was what they were curious to see.  \n\nSo, for my birthday,\
  \ and a couple of days after, I was fed and feted like a celebrity. I truly never\
  \ expected that."
