Text: "\"Have you charged your camera?\u201D he asks, his eyes avoiding mine.\nWe\u2019\
  re on our way to visit Rok\u2019s newly purchased house in Croatia, which is also\
  \ the last stop in my 2-month long trip across the Balkans. Shortly before, we\u2019\
  re visiting the monument Petrova Gora, a swirly, shiny silos-like structure atop\
  \ a naked green hill, erected to honor the fallen rebels of the region. I visited\
  \ it once when I was 6 but Rok warns me that it\u2019s in worse state now.\n\u201C\
  I forgot to charge it One Time. No need for the condescending tone\u201D, I protest,\
  \ knowing full well I can\u2019t confidently claim I\u2019ve done it.\nRok is from\
  \ Croatia, and I\u2019m from Serbia, a territory once united under a display of\
  \ brotherhood and might, later split into several, poorer countries. But we got\
  \ some good, tense jokes out of the ordeal.\nAt the parking lot, Rok launches into\
  \ stories I believe I\u2019d heard before \u2013 stories of how his grandfather\
  \ helped build this place, how his father used to take him here back when it was\
  \ still a museum, and how he then witnessed its slow decay, as its outer face disappeared\
  \ into the arms of thieves, one metal plate after another. The inside is reinforced\
  \ concrete, while the outer fa\xE7ade has thousands of stainless steel plates the\
  \ sun flickers off of to the very foot of the hill.\nThe uphill path is short and\
  \ overgrown, the weather rather nice with some ominous clouds approaching from behind.\
  \ We reach a concrete plateau, like many I\u2019d seen in similar communist squares.\
  \ The grey monotony is forbidding, the ghost of heroic presence dwarfing us all.\
  \ As we approach, Rok stops every few seconds as if to absorb what he\u2019s seeing.\
  \ I can almost see him comparing the tin tower against the memory of more steel\
  \ and less grass, the chrome giant stretching into the sky, hand enveloped in his\
  \ father\u2019s, on a nicer bygone day. But the more we approach, the more its grandeur\
  \ shrinks until I\u2019m right in front, feeling out of place. At the top of the\
  \ spiral staircase, I know the monument is only his now. My ilk has no business\
  \ here. Suddenly, a monument that was once built to honor brothers who battled oppression\
  \ and tyranny, is telling me that some places forever remain a battlefield.\nThe\
  \ wind is strong and it\u2019s hurting my cheeks. Rok says that the view reaches\
  \ Slovenia on one side and Bosnia on the other, though I can\u2019t confirm that\u2019\
  s true. We will not stay long, the clouds are closing in around us, and if he asks\
  \ me to take a photo of him, I will have to admit that my battery is empty."
