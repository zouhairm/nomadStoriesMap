Text: "Slogging through pouring rain at 4:00 A.M. doesn\u2019t sound like a perfect\
  \ vacation day. Nothing, however, could have dampened my spirits when headed for\
  \ a blind overlooking a lek frequented by the cock-of-the-rock in Ecuador\u2019\
  s Mindo Cloud Forest. In borrowed rubber boots, we picked our way carefully over\
  \ slick terrain while Ana, our private local guide with whom we\u2019d gotten close\
  \ throughout the week, aimed her flashlight at roots and vines that tried to hamper\
  \ our progress. It was all worth it, of course, as tiny spears of sun began peeking\
  \ through the foliage and the mating dances began. \n\nMystified after the incredible\
  \ spectacle, we trudged happily back up the steep trail. When we emerged from the\
  \ forest, we stood in awe as the fierce equatorial sun turned the recent downpour\
  \ to vapor, and the clouds rose from the rainforest to the sky. \n\nAna knew everyone\
  \ in Mindo, it seemed. Everywhere we went people greeted her with hugs or waved\
  \ to her from vehicles. So it was no surprise that as we headed toward our van,\
  \ the owners of the land called down to her from their little house perched up on\
  \ a hill. \n\n\u201CYou want to meet, yes?\u201D She already knew the answer. We\u2019\
  d taken every opportunity to engage with the locals during our stay, even having\
  \ had the opportunity to meet some of Ana\u2019s family. \n\nIt was a short hike\
  \ to the top of the hill. The house was small, with no glass on the windows. Anna\
  \ made introductions, speaking to the older couple in quick Spanish. They smiled,\
  \ then pulled us into embraces as if we were family. Ana turned to us. \n\n\u201C\
  They ask to join them for breakfast,\u201D she said. \u201CThis is OK?\u201D \n\n\
  \u201CSi, muchos gracias,\u201D I smiled, taking the woman\u2019s offered hand.\n\
  \nWe followed her to the back of the house, and I stopped to stare. Below us, in\
  \ every direction, the rainforest revealed its full splendor; lush green with the\
  \ last wisps of cloud drifting lazily toward the heavens. Breath stolen, I turned\
  \ to my host, eyes wide. Her gaze met mine, a knowing look. \u201CPrecioso,\u201D\
  \ she whispered, and I knew she understood. \n\nWe sat on mismatched chairs at a\
  \ homemade table, sipping thick, dark coffee poured from a dented pot and eating\
  \ empanadas cooked at the outdoor kitchen. For the next two hours, with Ana interpreting,\
  \ we chatted like old friends about the beauty of the land they proudly called home,\
  \ and the joy in the simplicity of life in the Mindo Cloud Forest. \n\nThe images\
  \ of that surreal day will stay with me forever; the day I had breakfast in the\
  \ clouds."
