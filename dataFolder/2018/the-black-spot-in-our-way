Text: "And here we are, victims of the most overwhelming happiness we had ever felt,\
  \ jumping from the boat before it gets to the beach, plunging to our chins, wetting\
  \ our clothes and laughing to the tears, we are just too excited to feel again that\
  \ stunningly warm soft water.\n\n\u201CDios te pague\u201D was the name of that\
  \ beach in \"Los Roques\".\n\nStanding on the almost white sand there was a humble\
  \ wooden shack, it was soft blue, just like if it has been fished out from the sea.\
  \ It had four trunks holding the roof,  three long and rough tables right under\
  \ it and two men with smiles brighter than a pearl, serving the food they had prepared.\
  \ We approached. And that was the first time we heard her name:\n\n-\xBFDid you\
  \ feed \u201CRoc\xEDo\u201D?\n-\xBFHow is Roc\xEDo?- we inquired\n-Roc\xEDo is my\
  \ friend- laughed the old Efraim\n\nThat's how we met him, the owner of the place,\
  \ at first he was shy, but us flattering his \u201Carepas\u201D (a typical venezuelan\
  \ food), loose him enough to tell us about how he lived there alone, swimming with\
  \ sharks and playing with \u201CRoc\xEDo\u201D.\n\nAt that point, we were extremely\
  \ curious to meet \u201CRoc\xEDo\u201D\n\n-I can take her out- Proposed Efraim.\
  \ The other guy rolled his eyes and said something about how hard was to pull her\
  \ in again, Efraim mocked him\n\n-Wait here-Said the old man.\n\nAnd there, after\
  \ a heavenly food served on plastic plates, in front of a dazzling immensity, of\
  \ a blue that purified you just by seeing it and to a shack that looked like home,\
  \ there, Roc\xEDo appeared running through us, and yes, she was the last thing we\
  \ expected. \n\n\"Roc\xEDo\" was this GIANT black pig. There came that laugh again,\
  \ that \"Los Roques\" laugh, the kind of laughter that just overgrows out of your\
  \ body, it was not a \u201Cfunny\u201D kind of laugh, it was pure emotion. There,\
  \ completely out of her habitat, swimming next to sharks and fishes, a black pig\
  \ that doubled our size was letting us pet her like a dog. At that moment we knew,\
  \ in \u201CLos Roques\u201D there were no limits for \u201Cpossible\u201D. \n\n\
  We played with her for an hour, and yes, it was really hard to pull her in again.\
  \ We said thanks and a minutes later, goodbye.\n\nI\u2019m never going to forget\
  \ Los Roques, it feels different there, like entering into another world, the water\
  \ its soft, like a caress,  and the sun, the sun seems to be singing you a song,\
  \ the happiest song you had ever heard, the kind of song you want to wake up to.\
  \ \n\nThe last thing I expected was to meet happiness right there, in a modest wooden\
  \ shack, shaking my hand in the shape of a sunshine."
