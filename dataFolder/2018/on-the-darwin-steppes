Text: "When I was 15 years old I participated in the excavation of Erebuni Fortress\
  \ which is an Urartian fortified city, founded in 782 B.C. and as a result of the\
  \ excavation we found animal remains. That was my first experience to realize where\
  \ we come from and learn about our origin. Further on, I started to deepen my research\
  \ in the understanding of the human origin. Consequently, during my studies I have\
  \ got acquainted with the theories of Darwin and stories about him. It had a great\
  \ influence on me, particularly, when choosing my profession. Thus, I have chosen\
  \ the path of biology and bioinformatics as a part of it, as these are extremely\
  \ powerful tools for a better understanding of our origin. I clearly understand\
  \ that my biggest aim is to explore the existing information on evolution and evolutional\
  \ biology and, as a best result, explore the roots of origins of humans. \nWhen\
  \ I was in my third year of studies, I read an article about caves in Armenia, where\
  \ traces of Neanderthals were supposed to be found. Owing to my curious and goal-oriented\
  \ nature, I continued my studies and found the authors of the aforementioned article,\
  \ who offered me to become a member of their research team. This was very important\
  \ to me as Darwin also participated in the voyage of \u201CHMS Beagle\u201D which\
  \ helped him to create his own theories. Thus, I started to be actively involved\
  \ in the researches carried out by the Department of the Early Archaeology of Armenia,\
  \ Institute of Archaeology and Ethnography of the National Academy of Sciences of\
  \ the Republic of Armenia. I assist in field expeditions sampling biological and\
  \ archaeological materials from caves and other places. I am proud to mention that\
  \ during our international expedition with Italian research group we have discovered\
  \ new caves with cave painting for the first time in the region. Ultimately, this\
  \ expeditions and fieldwork have broadened my knowledge and skills by inspiring\
  \ me to continue the path of achieving my greatest aims.  I want similar Darvin\
  \ travel to Patagonia."
