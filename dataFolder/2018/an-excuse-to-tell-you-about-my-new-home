Text: "I wanted to have a normal life: work 8 hours a day,  rent a room, have a pet,\
  \ and 15 days of holidays a year. But, they called me to work in Cabo Polonio. I\
  \ had no jobs for those days so I said YES!\n\nAnd suddenly, I was living  with\
  \ one Spanish, 3 Argentinian, 4 Uruguayans, a Paraguayan-Uruguayan girl and me,\
  \ from Venezuela. All unknowing people sharing the same piece of roof in the secluded\
  \ town of Cabo Polonio. \n\nEl Poderoso \"The Powerful\" was the name of our home.\
  \ It was the only ranch in Cabo Polonio with the walls painted by a Brazilian girl,\
  \ built with rest of a container's corpse, nobody knows how it keeps stable, I think\
  \ is the freestyle of many hands, nails and drinks.\n\nDuring the winter it becomes\
  \ a recreational space that allows the owner and his friends. The legend says that\
  \ nights there are so hectic, and when summer is coming and you start to clean,\
  \ you could find an alcoholic and drugged souls out of the walls and floorboards.\
  \ And if you're lucky, you may even resuscitate a punky. During the summer it is\
  \ a modest home. When it's windy, it rocks us like babies in the crib, if it's raining,\
  \ the roof metal amplifies every drop of water, if the rain is constant we can't\
  \ talk each other, because there is as hard as electronic show.\n\nEl Poderoso is\
  \ the typical house of fairy tales: it has dark wood, triangular roof, two doors\
  \ less than 2 meters high, exterior stairs that force you to concentrate well after\
  \ a \"hard night\" and most of the small glass windows remember you the wind, not\
  \ because it want, but because some glass squares are broken. There is no electricity.\
  \ We light with candles and our smiles. It smells damp from old house with waves\
  \ of perfumes, spray deodorants and seawater. It tastes like cold morning coffee.\
  \ You hear everything, but you can see nothing.\n\nThe children sleep downstairs\
  \ and the girls on the top floor, but we listen to each other's sighs. We call each\
  \ other without seeing each other, we listen while we dress and we sleep while the\
  \ others walk. If is a gray day, we get together side by side sitting in a circle,\
  \ with a round of mate, tellings stories and reading aloud and if we are very mystical,\
  \ we philosophize. If we have nothing to say we invite the silence to sit with us\
  \ sometimes, and it's not boring. We listen, we enjoy our breathe, our present.\n\
  \nI lived surrounded by grass, horses, toads, mushrooms, sand and sea; I lived with\
  \ people that I didn't know who they were, but I know who they are, people I call\
  \ FAMILY."
