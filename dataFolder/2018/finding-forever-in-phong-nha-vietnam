Text: "It began by putting on a lifejacket and a helmet with a headlamp. And then\
  \ a descent to some rocks at the mouth of the cave where the three of us, an American,\
  \ a Dane, and a Portuguese, followed our Vietnamese guide, lowering ourselves into\
  \ the cold water which led into Tra Ang Cave in Phong Nha, Vietnam. The light of\
  \ the mouth quickly disappeared as we swam deeper and deeper, around corners, through\
  \ large water filled halls, where, I imagined, a Tolkien dwarf kingdom might have\
  \ dwelled once in a different age. Columns of stalactites lined the king\u2019s\
  \ ceiling. Our guide signaled us to stop and turn off our headlamps to pitch black.\
  \ We became engulfed in silence floating there. In this deep crevice of the world.\
  \ Nobody breathed. We seeped into the nothingness. And then, after a moment, or\
  \ maybe an eternity, in joyous unison 3\u20262\u20261\u2026we howled! The sound\
  \ reverberated around the cave, like it would stay trapped in there forever. As\
  \ if the cave who had stood silent for a million years had finally found her voice\
  \ and would never now let it go. And we floated in the darkness and listened. The\
  \ cave\u2019s walls, trumpets, blasting the expressions of our happy souls back\
  \ and forth and all around.\n\n\u2026Were all stars to disappear or die,\nI should\
  \ learn to look at an empty sky\nAnd feel its total dark sublime,\nThough this might\
  \ take me a little time.\n\u2013 W. H. Auden\n\nOur guide told us when a stalagmite\
  \ and a stalactite join together they become married. He pointed at a pair that\
  \ were only millimeters from touching and said \u201CMaybe when we die, they will\
  \ get married.\u201D Maybe they will, I thought. Whatever the outcome of my life\u2014\
  my accomplishments, failures, impacts. They will all pale in comparison to the monumental\
  \ event of these two giant structures deep in this remote cave in this remote land\
  \ who have been chasing each other for millions of years finally coming together\
  \ as one. \n\nDaunting to be so insignificant. That anxiety of smallness in the\
  \ shadow of a mountain or in the darkness of a cave. But as our voices echoed through\
  \ the halls the essence of eternity was in the air. And for a moment, however brief,\
  \ we joined with that eternity and left a tiny mark on it. And that was the last\
  \ thing I expected.\n\nI like to think to myself that if I returned to that cave\
  \ alone and paused in silence, I might still hear the tremors of souls still, and\
  \ forever, ringing out through the darkness."
