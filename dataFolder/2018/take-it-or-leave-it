Text: "I was looking at the white sand, which reflected the sunlight flashing it directly\
  \ to my eyes; the turquoise green water going up the shore, its edge becoming light\
  \ and fleeting foam, and then going back to the restless whole\u2026that was happiness,\
  \ freedom, independence. He was at my side. His golden skin, reflecting the sunshine,\
  \ was even more appealing. His red lips and blond hair seemed even brighter facing\
  \ that vision. I could say I realised my dream, at last. I was where I wanted to\
  \ be, with the one I loved, everything was perfect.\nBut there was just one thing.\
  \ Was it possible that my imagination was tricking me again? The lighthouse at the\
  \ left corner of the view was slowly turning grey. I certainly remembered it was\
  \ white, when I first approached the dock from which I was admiring the stunning\
  \ panorama. As I laid my gaze on the subtle line where the sea switched place with\
  \ the sky, I saw a group of little grey stains spotting the light blue panel, coming\
  \ towards us. They got bigger and bigger, like a menacing storm approaching. But\
  \ I was still warm, I didn\u2019t feel the heavy wind which was carrying them. Unexpectedly,\
  \ from the bright surface of the sea, several grey pillars started to rise. They\
  \ looked cold and tough, unbreakable. Soon, the whole view was obscured by those\
  \ large blocks of concrete, and windows started to grow on them too.\nWithout realizing\
  \ it, I was in my apartment again, looking outside the window. The sky was cloudy,\
  \ the buildings were all around me, dense and crumbling. A young woman, probably\
  \ a mother without any expectation concerning her future, was waving a tablecloth\
  \ outside her tiny balcony. That was her life, her routine, and that was mine. Passing\
  \ a chequered shred on a lid, trying to dry each and every drop of water straining\
  \ on its metallic surface. I couldn\u2019t stop thinking I didn\u2019t want my life\
  \ to be like that. Always hoping for the better, always dreaming about a better\
  \ place and a better time. But then again, I found myself in the same apartment,\
  \ with the same people, far away from the one I loved, not doing what I loved.\n\
  There was just one move, a leap in the dark. However, that darkness could be friendlier\
  \ than the light I was in; that obscurity made of strangers, who might understand\
  \ better; that unknown place, which might be brighter and more comfortable from\
  \ the one I was in; that adventure, which might help me get rid of my fears. Was\
  \ I ready, was I going to discover it soon? That was my decision, no one else\u2019\
