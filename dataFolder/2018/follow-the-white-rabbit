Text: "What\u2019s the best way to visit a city, sometimes I wonder? That Wednesday,\
  \ Sara and I, a long time friend and travel companion, decided to aimlessly walk\
  \ the loud streets of Osaka. \n\nAfter Kyoto, the sheer visual noise of Osaka\u2019\
  s colourful, busy streets made us feel just like Alice: we had fallen down the rabbit\
  \ hole, but landed in a sunnier version of a Blade Runner Los Angeles rather than\
  \ Wonderland. And then came the white rabbit:\n\n- Do you speak English?\n- Yes,\
  \ I replied.\n- Pop singer. By the river. Now.\n\nThis Japanese man dressed in a\
  \ black suit and wearing small round glasses disappeared right after having delivered\
  \ his message in the busy crowd of Osaka. So by the river we went.\n\nIt always\
  \ surprises me where you can end up when drifting in a stranger city. Magic somehow\
  \ tend to happen when you give in to your wanderlust.\n\nAs we walked by the river,\
  \ something out of a Rammstein song started playing and four Japanese girls dressed\
  \ in neon colours with a mask holding chainsaw and giant scissors came out jumping\
  \ to the sound. As we were shaking our heads to the beat of a Powerpuff girls version\
  \ of Jason Voorhees, being two girls leaving in Ireland, we thought \u201Cwhat a\
  \ lovely day for a pint!\u201D. While we were sipping our beer, we noticed enthusiastic\
  \ grown men fans following the band choreography with exact precision. \n\nHowever,\
  \ our Irish influence didn\u2019t stop with beer: soon after we got our drinks,\
  \ it started to rain. We took shelter under a large street umbrella that was nearby\
  \ where we found Ishida.\n\nAs we noticed this older gentleman, mid 70s yet a younger\
  \ soul transpiring, wearing beige loose trousers, a green t-shirt and a hat, also\
  \ taking shelter from the rain, a smile crossed all our faces.\n\nIshida pointed\
  \ at us and spoke in Japanese. With merely an education in the Japanese language\
  \ from anime, neither of us could fully grasp what he meant. Which is when we realised\
  \ the universality of mimicry and smiles. Yet, it is the willingness to be vulnerable\
  \ and to putting the effort that truly bridges communication.  \n\n- Like (drink)?\
  \ Ishida moved his hand as drinking from a cup.\n- Yes! We said simultaneously.\n\
  - I show you Deep Osaka. And a big smile took over his face.\n\nFrom Wonderland,\
  \ passing by Blade Runner, I was feeling we were about to enter a Japanese gangster\
  \ movie. Or maybe Ishida was going to be another white rabbit leading us to a new\
  \ unforgettable adventure? As curiosity won over apprehension, to the Deep Osaka\
  \ we went."
