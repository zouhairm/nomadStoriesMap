Text: "I walked to the top of the concrete hill and looked out at the surrounding\
  \ mountains on the outskirts of Yerevan, Armenia. It was 2 p.m. and the green and\
  \ brown landscape across the hill was still and peaceful. I felt fully present.\
  \ My ears buzzed with the sweet sounds of song coming from the orphans and refugees\
  \ at Camp Aragats. I was in the safest place in the world. My heart was so full.\n\
  \nAnd Meline was by my side. \n\nMeline was seven-years-old and had big, yet soft\
  \ and beautiful brown eyes that lit up her sweet face. Her wavy brown hair was pulled\
  \ back into a ponytail, and her baby hairs curled to the front side of her face.\
  \ She was special \u2013 a free spirit who opened my heart. \n\nEveryday she would\
  \ come and find me, hug me behind, and then say, \"Menq dzez sireng gy\" (I love\
  \ you). It didn't matter if we couldn't speak each other\u2019s language; I felt\
  \ her love through gestures, hugs, kisses and quality time.\n\nShe showed me the\
  \ spot along the rainbow painted benches where she and her friends hung out. They\
  \ would take turns braiding my hair, tucking one piece over and under the other\
  \ while weaving in small pink flowers. Meline\u2019s energy was incredible, she\
  \ made me feel like a kid again, dancing all day and night, and finding joy in the\
  \ littlest of things like the games we made up. Our favorite game was, \u201CMeg,\
  \ yergoo, yerek, toon,\u201D (one, two, three, you) an Armenian take on Duck, Duck,\
  \ Goose.\n\nDuring a bonfire one night, I was holding Meline close to my chest.\
  \ I watched her eyes glisten as one of the counselors set off fireworks. She was\
  \ amazed by the sound, shape, and pop of fire in the night sky. Her small hands\
  \ rose into the air, as if she was trying to grasp the sparkles. I knew in that\
  \ moment why we were drawn to each other. I felt I understood her gentle soul.\n\
  \nThe next morning, I couldn\u2019t find Meline anywhere. She had unexpectedly left\
  \ camp early. My heart sunk as I began to think how I never got the chance to say\
  \ goodbye. I wasn\u2019t ready to let her go. There were still more hugs I wanted\
  \ to give her and more songs we had to dance to. I was crushed. But it was during\
  \ this sad time I realized how much joy she brought me. She cracked my heart open\
  \ and let light flow in. I was a stranger in this place, but I had never felt more\
  \ present and care free in the world. There was just something about her spirit\
  \ that latched onto mine and fed it with love. I am forever grateful to Meline for\
  \ opening my heart. I believe I will see her again one day."
