Text: "The last pint was nearly finished and the cab summoned when in the darkened\
  \ haven of The Honest Politician a cheerless song began to play. This tear-drencher\
  \ was the last thing I needed. It was condensing the misery I was hoping to dispose\
  \ of in the first place. With its pebbled beaches, pies and seagull cries, big museums\
  \ and little pubs, Portsmouth was brilliant. One week simply wasn\u2019t enough.\
  \ I missed my local friends already. Downing the remnants of my pint, now a bittersweet\
  \ parting cocktail of beer mixed with tears, I grabbed my backpack and lumbered\
  \ for the door.\nOutside it was already dark, and I approached the vehicle warily.\
  \ Courtesy of numerous cabmen in my homeland, who routinely added to one\u2019s\
  \ culture shock with their bad attitude bordering on antisocial behavior, the animal\
  \ part of my brain expected something slightly dreadful. \u201CHey, how you doing\
  \ tonight?\u201D The briskness and utter Englishness of the cabbie\u2019s voice\
  \ hit me pleasantly as my sorry behind landed on the back seat. \u201CGreat, thanks.\u201D\
  \ I managed a smile, but he was left unconvinced, sizing me up through a pair of\
  \ sunglasses, nighttime or not. The Brits are strange, but always in a dapper way.\
  \ \u201CCrikey, you sound like you\u2019re dead!\u201D His voice was quirky, as\
  \ if I was about to ride with a cartoon character. The humor in his intonations\
  \ contrasted with my misery even more than honesty contrasted with politicians.\
  \ \u201CWhere you from?\u201D The cab started along the street, passing dollhouse\
  \ buildings and dark shop windows so tempting to explore. \u201CRussia.\u201D \u201C\
  How d\u2019you like it here?\u201D \u201CIt\u2019s marvelous!\u201D I said, trying\
  \ to sound jolly and failing spectacularly. \u201CLooks like you could use some\
  \ cheering up,\u201D the cabbie said. \u201CI\u2019ve got something special here\
  \ to set the right mood.\u201D\nHe pressed a few buttons. Funky music started to\
  \ play. Out of the blue, a disco ball appeared in the middle of the car. Whoa! The\
  \ ball was sending lights bouncing all over the place, turning the cab into a fabulous\
  \ dance floor. The cabbie kept talking in his cartoonish voice. He was really a\
  \ DJ, hoping to win a lottery someday so he could concentrate on \u201Chis thing\u201D\
  , and he was joking non-stop. By the time we reached the station I was praying he\u2019\
  d win all the lotteries in the world. This was the weirdest and most delightful\
  \ ride in my entire life. Before leaving, I informed the cabbie that he was absolutely\
  \ gorgeous, but he knew that already. No point in being sad, I thought. I\u2019\
  ll come back. This place is just too marvelous to avoid."
