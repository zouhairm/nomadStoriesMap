Text: "\u201COh you\u2019re going to LOVE Berlin.\u201D\n\nThat sentence haunted me.\
  \ It came out of the mouths of my trendy friends in Australia. It was drawled by\
  \ strangers who wear berets in smoky pubs at night, and it was echoed by a slew\
  \ of fellow backpackers in communal kitchens.\n\nI finally arrived in Berlin with\
  \ my moleskine journal, my cousin Rose, and Great Expectations. In my sentimental\
  \ and romantic mind, Berlin was a mecca for the artistic youth of my generation,\
  \ a beacon for disillusioned twenty-something creatives trying to find themselves\
  \ somewhere between the 24-hour D\xF6ner Kebab joints, and the bilingual copies\
  \ of Brecht. Like them, I came to explore the fleamarkets, to dance till dawn in\
  \ a haze of techno clubs, and to take candid yet pensive pictures of myself in front\
  \ of street art. It is with this naivety and a hunger for risk that we decide to\
  \ explore an abandoned spy station on the outskirts of Berlin. Then, we got lost.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s autumn and the air is starting to bite, we have the forest to ourselves.\
  \ Grunewald forest is the largest area of green in the city of Berlin. So, we could\
  \ be lost for a while. When we finally spot a dog-walker, his tweed flat cap makes\
  \ him looks like he has stepped out of an Agatha Christie novel. He should have\
  \ been rambling the moors but somehow ended up in the wrong country. Hopefully,\
  \ he wasn\u2019t the murderer in that tale, because we need directions\n\n\u201C\
  Entschuldigen, wo ist um\u2026 Teufelsberg?\u201D Rose\u2019s 10th grade German\
  \ is tentative.\n\nHe grins \u201CAh! Yes! The Devils Mountain! Just that way.\u201D\
  \ His English is perfect. He waves his hand generally back the way he came: \u201C\
  You can\u2019t miss it.\u201D \n\nIt takes us two more hours to find it. The base\
  \ of the station is wrapped in barbed wire, the towers are huge and white, onn the\
  \ only hill in Berlin. Ironic, for a spy station. The magic is inside, you'll find\
  \ monsters painted in the corridors and the horizon framed by ripped canvas and\
  \ collapsing brick walls. The beauty of Teufelsberg is the reality of its deterioration,\
  \ and the determination to decorate it anyway.\n\nI didn\u2019t love the Berlin\
  \ my friends raved about. The Berlin I love can be found standing inside the dilapidated\
  \ golf-ball structures of Teufelsberg listening to the wind as it hums to you. It\u2019\
  s the loneliness of that view. It\u2019s in the intersection of history and irreverent\
  \ street art; it\u2019s even in the dodgy guy at a trestle table who definitely\
  \ doesn\u2019t own the place but will charge you a fee anyway. How do you get there?\
  \ Well\u2026 you can\u2019t miss it."
