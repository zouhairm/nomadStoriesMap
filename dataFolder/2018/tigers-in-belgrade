Text: "I hadn\u2019t actually intended to go to Serbia. It hadn\u2019t even occurred\
  \ to me. And then suddenly found myself wandering the Kalemegdan Fortress with a\
  \ new friend in Belgrade, as the sun set over the confluence of the Danube and Sava\
  \ rivers. And that\u2019s when the tiger strolled by, several hundred feet below\
  \ us, between the labyrinthine walls circling the fortress grounds, and I hadn\u2019\
  t been in Belgrade long enough to know about the zoo\n\nTo share the background,\
  \ I had been in Marseille, chatting with a hostel worker and he asked me how long\
  \ I had left, visa-wise, in the Schengen area. I blinked, stupidly, did some googling\
  \ and some backlog calculations, and, whoops, under three weeks.\n\nSo I turned\
  \ to the internet, and a week later, I had a hostel volunteer job in Belgrade, and\
  \ a new friend introducing me to the city, and was watching a tiger pace at the\
  \ base of the walls.\n \nMy friend let me gape for a good minute or so, at the walls\
  \ and the river and the tiger, before taking pity and leading me around the edges\
  \ of the fortress \u2013 two millennia old, my American brain kept bleating, blankly\
  \ \u2013 and catching glimpses of the animals still out lurking in the twilight.\n\
  \ \nBelgrade is low-key known as one of the Next Big Cities, with its history and\
  \ beauty and thriving culture, and legendary nightclub scene. The last night there,\
  \ I stayed in a hostel floating on the Danube \u2013 or maybe it was the Sava \u2013\
  \ drinking rakija with clich\xE9 melancholy and watching the sun set again, before\
  \ heading to Sarajevo in the morning, which is a story of itself.\n \nBut that tiger\
  \ sticks in my mind like a snapshot, prowling towards its den, as the sun glittered\
  \ dimly behind me and the lights of Belgrade began to glow, sprawling in the southeast,\
  \ and hinting at Sarajevo."
