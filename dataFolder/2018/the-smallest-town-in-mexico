Text: "My dad says in 15 years this town will no longer exist. People move away, their\
  \ children aren't staying, there is no next generation. There are only 22 kids in\
  \ town. The people living in San Agustin Zacatecas, Mexico have families that have\
  \ been living here since the town first began.\nThis town is almost forgotten, it's\
  \ a small farming town and in most cases, it gets lumped in with other neighboring\
  \ towns or completely lumped with the main town 20 minutes away. There is only one\
  \ school, a primary school located in the town's center. \nIt's strange to be in\
  \ a place where I have a history but was a stranger, never having been here and\
  \ communicating in a language I bearly used anymore. I was an American city kind\
  \ of person. I knew of only one house in town with wifi. I had no cellular connection,\
  \ it was hard to imagine what this community did for fun.\nI realized that everything\
  \ in this town was an event.Every morning I walked to the neighbor's house and bought\
  \ fresh tortillas. I talked to the women, we had long genuine conversations. Even\
  \ though I never met her, she had known about me since my birth. She told me how\
  \ much I resembled my aunts, a reincarnated version of their youth. Breakfast was\
  \ always with the family like every meal was unless a neighbor walked in and invited\
  \ us to eat with their family. Every meal was important, we talk about how our family\
  \ members were scattered across borders and about our plans for the day.\nSchool\
  \ graduations are an important annual event here. Each family is responsible for\
  \ a dish. My grandmother was in charge of condoches, thick wheat patties that are\
  \ cooked in clay brick ovens outside. Everything is made fresh by hand, the only\
  \ tools used were our hands. Everyone sits together talking about stories or legends,\
  \ our laughter being heard from miles. This all takes place late June, while each\
  \ grade level has put together a dance performance for the whole town. Each child\
  \ picks a godmother for that graduation ceremony which is a real honor. Everyones\
  \ dressed in their best clothing to gather in the schoolyard as it becomes a dance\
  \ floor with live music from local bands playing. Everyone from the youngest to\
  \ the oldest come out to dance and eats the night away. \nI realize how alive this\
  \ town really is, even the members and families that have moved away still come\
  \ back once in a while to visit. The true magic of this town and other small Mexican\
  \ towns is how people live for people and the lives they build around each other."
