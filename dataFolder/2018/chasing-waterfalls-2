Text: "The thought of cooling off in a refreshing pool beneath a waterfall had been\
  \ on my mind since we left the comfort of our air conditioned beach bungalow a few\
  \ hours before.  The combination of heat and humidity was so intense that my skin\
  \ and eyes stung from the constant flow of sweat.  The sun beat down on the paved\
  \ road, reflecting up on us without remorse.  I had only brought one liter of water\
  \ and was quickly running out.  How much further would this waterfall be?\n\nBrynna\u2019\
  s cell phone finally chimed, \u201Cyour destination is on the left\u201D.  Confused,\
  \ we looked around for the waterfall only to be painfully disappointed that what\
  \ used to be a waterfall was a dried up pile of rocks.  We spent close to an hour\
  \ scouring the area for any trace of water that we could cool off in.  Exhausted\
  \ and dejected, we started our way back to the bungalow.\n\nNot long after, it began\
  \ to rain.  Finally some refreshment!  After a couple minutes, the light rain turned\
  \ into a downpour with cloud to ground lightning striking within 50 yards of us.\
  \  The road started to flood and soon we were running through ankle high water trying\
  \ to remember which way would lead us back.  We had made it about halfway when a\
  \ concerned looking Thai woman saw us splashing down the street, drenched from the\
  \ ongoing monsoon, and motioned for us to come with her.  She pointed to a covered\
  \ outdoor area outside of her home and gestured for us to sit at the table under\
  \ it.  Eager to get out of the rain, we thanked her and took shelter for the next\
  \ 45 minutes, communicating with her as best as we could.  After the rain slowed,\
  \ we thanked her and walked the rest of the way back to our bungalow.  \n\nWater\
  \ is a powerful force of nature.  Rivers connect mountains to the sea, just as an\
  \ unexpected downpour connected three strangers from opposite corners of the world\
  \ together for a few enlightening moments that will inform my view of humanity and\
  \ the world for the rest of my life.  Rarely do we find exactly what we are looking\
  \ for when we travel.  Guide books advise us places to go and things to see, but\
  \ we all develop our own personal interpretations based off of our experience. \
  \ Brynna and I would end up seeing another waterfall along with the pink dolphins\
  \ on an organized boat tour a couple days later.  However, the most memorable moment\
  \ from my time in Khanom was the day we went chasing waterfalls, ended up drenched\
  \ by the monsoon rains, and experienced the kindness of a stranger."
