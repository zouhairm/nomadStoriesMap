Text: "Sonam came in carrying a tray with freshly brewed coffee and bright yellow\
  \ omelettes. She had a kind face with good, honest eyes.\n - What do you like about\
  \ Sikkim the most? You have seen the world when working for Qatar airlines, you\
  \ could have chosen to live anywhere, you are young, yet you have chosen to settle\
  \ here with your air b\u2019n\u2019b.\nA puppy just run into the dining room and\
  \ licked Hugo\u2019s hand. \n - I went to pick up Spotty last week. I jumped in\
  \ the car and went down the main road. I drive it often, after all it is the only\
  \ asphalt road in the state. I looked at the signs to Pakyong where we will open\
  \ our airport this year. People here work so hard. Can you imagine building an airport\
  \ at this altitude in Himalayas, on the land with no even grounds? The opening was\
  \ postponed year to year because of landslides and water eruptions, but we never\
  \ give up. I have turned off the main road going through thick jungles. I finally\
  \ arrived at magnificent Rumtek monastery. I could be sitting there for hours just\
  \ listening to the chants of Tibetan monks. Spotty was the weakest puppy around\
  \ so I took him in. He was a bit scared at first and shaky, wrapped in blankets\
  \ at the back seat of my car. I was going down the curly narrow serpentine of steep\
  \ dirt roads, looking at the terraced fields. The people here are poor, but they\
  \ are respectful and honest. Our economy in Sikkim is agriculture, we owe everything\
  \ we have to our land, and although it would have been easier or cheaper, we have\
  \ driven away all the big companies with their fertilizers and seeds - our whole\
  \ production is fully organic. We are the only state in India like that. We don\u2019\
  t have plastic bags in here and we place the rubbish bins even on your trek paths\
  \ in the mountains, all our energy is sustainable. I think of my people and I can\
  \ not be prouder of who I am. But then I drove back home, sat down with him at the\
  \ window, just like now, and looked at Kangchenjunga. Standing there blushed with\
  \ the warm light of the sun, she shone. Her five cones covered with silver shimmer\
  \ of snow are always so close. She is a goddess, still sacred and worshiped by so\
  \ many of us. She looks down at us with love, that\u2019s why we don\u2019t allow\
  \ people climbing it. When I look at her, I know I could never call any other place\
  \ home\u2026. - Sonam paused, looked at the peaks in the distance. She smiled gently.\
  \  \n- I will be making fresh momos for dinner, would you like to have some?"
