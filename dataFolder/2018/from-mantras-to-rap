Text: "Ahai and I met Rose and Anne in a Buddhist monastery in Sri Lanka. My friend\
  \ and I have been together for so long, that we regarded ourselves as a married\
  \ couple with no sex. So, when we met our British mirror, we liked to hang around\
  \ as in a double date. They were also best friends and they have also developed\
  \ mutual frictions due to long cohabitation.\nThe four of us departed by train to\
  \ the Adam\u2019s Peak. I climbed all the way with Rose. She was a good listener.\
  \ We exchanged some intimate stories and thoughts. All of us were joyful on the\
  \ overwhelming peak and its sunrise. There was bliss and we were part of it. \n\
  We moved together to Nuwara Eliya and we rented a big shared room in a guest house.\
  \ Once there, the British girls wanted to do things that Ahai and I couldn\u2019\
  t afford, so, we split into two groups. Ahai and I rented a couple of old bikes\
  \ from a guy who offered himself as a tour guide. We went to a waterfall and a Buddhist\
  \ temple. By the end of the day he invited us to a pub. I extended the invitation\
  \ to our friends but they declined because they were going to a massage. \nWe were\
  \ on the pub, drinking, eating and laughing, when I received a text from Rose asking\
  \ me where the place was. I sent her the location, glad that they were coming. Rose\
  \ and Anne arrived but not alone. They came with the police. Anne\u2019s phone has\
  \ been stolen and they were blaming us. It took me some time to realize what was\
  \ happening, but when I did, I transformed the energy of hope into fury. I took\
  \ my purse and I pour off all its content over the floor, so they could see there\
  \ wasn\u2019t any iphone there. Ahai was mad at me for been that mad. \nWe were\
  \ taken to the police station. A quiet woman performed a lazy revision of our bags\
  \ in a closed room. We were told that the police checked our belongings in our room\
  \ without our permission. I couldn\u2019t believe it. I couldn\u2019t believe the\
  \ police reacted in such a way just because they were foreigners and I couldn\u2019\
  t believe that for the British, we were suspicious because we were from Mexico and\
  \ Belarus and not from a first-world country. What an embodied lesson! \nThat night\
  \ we returned hastily to the guest house just to pick up our stuff. Two days after,\
  \ Ahai realized we didn\u2019t pay our share of the room. We were laughing because\
  \ we indeed became thieves. I texted Rose to transfer the money into a bank account.\
  \ She refused. I think she was not just ashamed as she wrote, but sad as me because\
  \ of our compromised promising friendship."
