Text: "It was too early for Italians to be considering dinner, but my American sensibilities\
  \ and our long day trekking across Rome\u2019s seven hills combined to wrap my girlfriend\
  \ and me into a fog of hunger. With food in mind, we abandoned the crowd in the\
  \ Vatican and turned south to every travel blogger\u2019s favorite Roman neighborhood:\
  \ Trastevere. \nTrastevere has a reputation for being tourist-filled and overpriced\
  \ in areas, but without a guidebook or wifi connection between us, we decided to\
  \ simply wander through the streets until a dish or menu on an outdoor table caught\
  \ our eye. Unfortunately, we also caught the eye of many salesmen, hawking the best\
  \ lasagna in town. Sporting backpacks and sunburns, we could have hardly been more\
  \ obvious in tube socks.\nWe decided against every restaurant until we came to a\
  \ smiling, salt and peppered Roman outside the door to Ristorante da Massi. He didn\u2019\
  t try to lure us inside the way so many in this burgeoning neighborhood did\u2014\
  we were already sold on the yeasty, fresh pasta scent alone, and he knew it as well\
  \ as we did.\nHis cacio e pepe sealed the deal, and I pushed on a wooden door in\
  \ front of him. It didn\u2019t budge. Our gatekeeper shook his head with a warm\
  \ smile. \u201CThe artists\u2019 entrance,\u201D he explained. He turned and led\
  \ us through another door, to a table in a brighter dining room. A small step down\
  \ led to the first room I'd tried to enter, packed with tables with a haphazard\
  \ grace.\nOver the next two hours, we sipped glass after sweating glass of cool\
  \ Pecorino and watched Romans pour in. Sometimes they came through the door near\
  \ us to greet Alberto, our host. Sometimes, they marched confidently through the\
  \ \u2018artist\u2019s entrance\u2019\u2014how, I never understood. But they all\
  \ made their way to the darker, more chaotic dining room behind us.\nTourists also\
  \ noticed the queue and, curious, wandered through the (correct) door. Alberto greeted\
  \ each weary parent and doe-eyed couple and seated them near us in the now-crowded\
  \ front room. My girlfriend and I enjoyed our suppl\xEC and this anthropology experiment.\n\
  Being immediately singled out as a tourist is so often disappointing\u2014and yet,\
  \ here we were, with a wall between us and the locals more tangible than any language\
  \ barrier, and I couldn\u2019t find it in me to feel excluded by my tourist status.\n\
  How long does it take to be allowed through the artists\u2019 entrance\u2014until\
  \ we are travelers, instead of tourists? I don\u2019t know, but for the first time\
  \ since I learned the distinction, I don't mind."
