Text: "The cold air blew across me, chilling me to my bones as I stood staring into\
  \ the distance at the mighty mountains of the Himalayan range in absolute awe. A\
  \ trip that I planned and was anxious about.\n'Himachal Pradesh', nestled in the\
  \ very heart of the Himalayas is not only a mere trekking destination. It was the\
  \ \u201CLand of Gods\u201D. \nOur trek began, marching our way under the sunlight\
  \ in an ant line. Sheru, our guide nervously introduced himself, something that\
  \ he must have learned newly. After trudging for a short while, we nestled adjacent\
  \ to a wild waterfall, sipping freshly harvested crystal clear water. \u201CBadiya\
  \ jagah hai bhaiji\u201D, I exclaimed to which I meant, what an astonishing place!\
  \ He smiles, \u201CWelcome home my friend\u201D. And my journey begins.\nAs we moved\
  \ forward to our first base camp, I felt the warmth of the campfire and bathed in\
  \ the light of the little stars above. I felt content, happy. \nThe following day\
  \ took us through twists and turns under a weeping sky. Drenched, we looked at the\
  \ ground beneath us, a narrow, slippery trail was the only way to cross the Death\
  \ Valley which was a clean 200-foot drop right into the Parvati river. This shoed\
  \ away a mother and her daughter back to base camp. For now, I witnessed both, the\
  \ good and the bad. The night, drowned in darkness, enveloped us in a deep slumber.\
  \ \nWe depart before dawn, reach the summit and witness the peaks so bright, laden\
  \ with snow this immediately brought to my attention, why it was called \u201CThe\
  \ Land Of The Gods\u201D. Sliding down the peaks we felt a love so divine. This\
  \ left me feeling loved and in turn loving everything that I was surrounded by.\
  \ \nIt all came to an end, abruptly. Soon I was departing home like a lost soul.\
  \ Days drift by and every day I felt more nostalgic until one day I hear my phone\
  \ ring. I pick up to hear a hesitant mutter, \u201CHello, my name Sheru\u201D and\
  \ the fire rekindled, I was filled with warmth. We spoke until he surprised me by\
  \ asking me to open a cafe with him, thus shedding light like those of a thousand\
  \ stars followed by bringing in turmoil and destruction to make apt choices for\
  \ my career goals and family expectations.\nI head back the following year to start\
  \ a small Cafe along with my presently, close friend Sheru leaving me with a feeling\
  \ of being loved and loving all those around. \nWith all said, I conclude saying\
  \ that, initially mistaken, believing it was my mere addiction for destinations\
  \ which followed by making a local connection.\nOne to be treasured forever."
