Text: "\u2018Thanks very much\u2026\u2019 I said hesitantly, uncertain in my spoken\
  \ Chinese as well as my desire to down a bowl full of beer at 11 in the morning.\
  \ \u2018Ganbei!\u2019 (or bottoms up) was the retort. No such reservations on their\
  \ part.\nThis was the warm introduction my friend and I received from a Mongol family\
  \ residing on the bank of the beautiful Sayram lake in the westernmost province\
  \ of China, Xinjiang. We had willingly intruded on their lunch, and they willingly\
  \ fed us, and more willingly still, made us drink. We were huddled in one of their\
  \ three yurts cross legged, food spread cross the flooring, stove crackling in the\
  \ corner. Outside the yurt\u2019s curtain door, lush green hilltops were dotted\
  \ with the family\u2019s livestock, some gathered by the stream that trickled down\
  \ the grassy verge. The lake lay majestically below, shimmering in the afternoon\
  \ sun, leaving no traveller wondering why its name comes from the Kazakh word for\
  \ \u2018blessing\u2019.\nWe spent the day eating, drinking, horse riding, chatting\
  \ by the stream. We asked if we could stay the night. Our friends seemed anxious,\
  \ both anxious to help and about the possible consequences of doing so. It appeared\
  \ the official directive from the authorities was that no locals were to host visitors\
  \ as it would detract from the newly built hotel complex by the entrance to the\
  \ lake. This seemed a travesty for hosts and visitors alike \u2013 depriving locals\
  \ from a valuable source of income and the chance to share their culture with those\
  \ wanting a taste of their nomadic way of life.\nThis was by no means the first\
  \ travesty I embarked upon in my travels in China. Encountering elevators up to\
  \ the Great Wall of China and a Dicos fast food restaurant filling a mountain cave\
  \ Buddhist shrine with the inescapable stench of fried chicken instead of burning\
  \ incense had me, well, incensed. Some of China\u2019s finest tourist locations\
  \ seem to be paying a high price indeed for comfort and convenience. Now it seemed,\
  \ by Sayram Lake, the locals would pay too. \nTo our eternal thanks, our new friends\
  \ gambled and put us up for the night. As I lay there in darkness, I wondered how\
  \ many more would have the chance to wake up beside the lake in a yurt, rather than\
  \ a hotel suite and canteen breakfast? And how long until there\u2019s a Dicos?\
  \ More pressingly, how will the lives of our newfound friends fare against the tide\
  \ of construction from China\u2019s East to West? Perhaps it may bring prosperity,\
  \ or it may just be that our new friends will have to, as nomads do, move on."
