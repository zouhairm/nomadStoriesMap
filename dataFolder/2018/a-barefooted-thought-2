Text: "Not a phone call for a week, just time in solitude, getting to know myself\
  \ and basking in the new found love of my God, all of it seeming so surreal, so\
  \ dizzying. Not sure what to do next or how to get my feet moving. Battling some\
  \ tough decisions ahead and strengthening many flaws of the last two years, I stepped\
  \ out of the Retreat Centre at Kerala. All I knew is I had to live life large with\
  \ a little money and another 3 days, before heading back to family, where responsibilities,\
  \ obligations and reality lies.\n\nOne good pair of shoes for the journey, a broken\
  \ trolley bag, which I had to pull around with my scarf, a life changing biography\
  \ of Moulavi Sulaiman and a very anxious heart was what stood helplessly outside\
  \ the big black gate. Not knowing anything of Fort Kochi or its people, was as exciting\
  \ and daunting at the same time, making my heart skip every beat.\n\nAs I got into\
  \ the train, I would ask the locals for advice and directions all the time, just\
  \ to make sure I was headed the right way. A long walk from the station to the bus\
  \ in the blazing sun with all kinds of stares and suspicious offers for help followed\
  \ me; firstly for being an Indian girl travelling alone and secondly cluelessly\
  \ struggling to pull my broken bag with a scarf. Evading every set of eyes, I found\
  \ my way and got into an hour long bus journey to who knows where and what!.\n\n\
  And whoa!!! \n\nLittle did I expect to be treated to such a pretty place with so\
  \ many backpackers and travelers around. It was a \u2018luck by chance\u2019 decision,\
  \ surrounded by helpful and smiling faces giving me a gust of confidence for the\
  \ next 3 days. Still getting comfortable with being alone and the proud feeling\
  \ of making it on my own, I set out to explore the town. Walking around the quaint\
  \ little town, so awed by the antique buildings and enticing scent of spices and\
  \ flowers, I felt an unusual yet extraordinary peace in my heart.\n\nAs the day\
  \ mellowed, I remember walking by the beach with the cool water tickling my bare\
  \ feet and feeling so blissful to watch the sun set, with travelers and locals alike,\
  \ all sharing such a beautiful view. In spite of having so many differences, lifestyles\
  \ and dreams, we were all there in this one moment together. Just the thought of\
  \ such a diverse yet simple gathering gave me a sense of freedom, belonging and\
  \ confidence to take on the world in all its forms. \n\nPeople and experiences are\
  \ the constant battles and trophies we win everyday; neither all the money nor the\
  \ big fat promotion can compare to that."
