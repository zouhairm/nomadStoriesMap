Text: "India is a giant which can stupefy people by its charm and an ever-changing\
  \ heterogeneous mass and I am a part of it. After a trip to Pune, I was on my way\
  \ back to New Delhi, which was a 28-hour journey in a train.\n\nI woke up at 9 am\
  \ in an ac compartment of a train, I wanted to brush my teeth but the public washroom\
  \ already looked dirty, the train came to a halt at a railway station named Vidisha,\
  \ in Madhya Pradesh.\nI spotted a clean drinking water dispenser but was in a dilemma\
  \ if I should leave the train or not.\nI: How long does the train stop here sir,\
  \ can I go, brush my teeth and come back.\nVendor: Ohh! Sir, for some 5-7 minutes\n\
  \nWithout a second thought ran to brush in a pair of boxer shorts, no money and\
  \ a phone with 10% battery.\nAfter brushing, I turned and before I could lift my\
  \ legs, I was having contractions, the train had left me, I kept running till I\
  \ could not see train anymore. Everything that I possessed got away, for help I\
  \ rushed to the control room, after telling the lady officer (LO) about my story,\
  \ \nLO:  A train is scheduled in 50 minutes overtakes your train at Agra (City of\
  \ Taj Mahal), you can take that train. Aaah, I am sorry son, but the train is approximately\
  \ 2 hours late.\nI had two hours, next, I remember was standing beside a 113 B.C,\
  \ Heliodorous [H] pillar, commissioned by a Greek ambassador H, few miles from the\
  \ station. Both of us were from far lands but I could connect to him,\nH:   Why\
  \ do you look so frightened, child?\nSir: You know what I did.\nH:   If I can come\
  \ to a foreign land and get a pillar build you definitely can chill and will be\
  \ good, trust me.\n\nMy thought process flipped, all I had to do was pretend that\
  \ I have ticket and board the train back.\nAfter getting into the train, I was starving,\
  \ had no plans to steal food from train pantry but could not resist. \nI had called\
  \ my cousin to collect my luggage from Agra station, train halts for two minutes,\
  \ I had to get down to find my cousin, get myself back in the train, by the time\
  \ this happened, the train had left too. \nI heard an announcement that another\
  \ train was heading to Delhi. As I entered the train, the ticket collector caught\
  \ me and I had no ticket, he wanted to imprison me for a month, finally only fined\
  \ me.\n\nTwo hours later I reached Delhi and my satiety centers felt embraced. Every\
  \ journey has something to impart, all we need is to instill the ability to recognize\
  \ what has been diffused within and always someone like H is there to help."
