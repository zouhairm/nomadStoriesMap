Text: "I egressed the smoky airport baggage claim to meet the beaming smiles of my\
  \ long-time friend and her new family bundled up in their scarves and winter attire.\
  \ I stripped off my cardigan as we piled all seven of us into a hoary sedan. A few\
  \ blinks later, I followed a hastily built bridge over barges, floating debris,\
  \ and other boats before I hopped onto my boat for the day alongside my Nubian fishing\
  \ guide and security guard armed with a locked and loaded AK-47. A quick sputter\
  \ launched us into the water of Lake Nasser as we headed on our fishing expedition.\
  \ The brisk winter air sent a chill down my back as I stood at the hull of the boat\
  \ watching my line float into the cerulean waves. The clouds rolled on with the\
  \ hours as our travels began to wind down. The bottom of the boat scraped against\
  \ the sand as we pulled into an island where a few of the local Nubian fisherman\
  \ lived. My new Nubian friend, Hamdy, ushered me into the diffused glow of evening\
  \ light outside of the shack. Hamdy informed me that I was the guest of the Nubians\
  \ and it was tradition to prepare a feast for their guests. As I began to speak\
  \ Arabic with the Nubians, I was met with perplexed countenances upon their sun-baked\
  \ faces. I glanced around before my eyes led me to an unoccupied carpet. Before\
  \ I knew it, the bowls and dishes were swiftly tossed onto the muted yellow rug\
  \ as the amiable men followed. Steaming off the fire, traditional tea was passed\
  \ to me in addition to stalks of vegetables with bread in preparation for the fish.\
  \ A saut\xE9ed tilapia landed on the mat in front of me. Although I couldn\u2019\
  t speak the Nubian language, my gratitude was evident in my actions. The Nubians\
  \ lived such a simple life on their little piece of heaven, and were still willing\
  \ to give me, a stranger, nearly all of what they had. I was in awe of the generosity\
  \ the Nubians showed me all evening long. The festivities winded down and before\
  \ I realized it, the boat\u2019s engine was running again. Shouts and arm waves\
  \ got smaller and smaller as the sun began to set over the hilly terrain while our\
  \ boat whizzed past the island."
