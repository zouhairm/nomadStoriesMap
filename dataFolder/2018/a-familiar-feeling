Text: "The light burned my eyes and the fumes burned my swollen throat. The air tasted\
  \ of dust and burning plastic and the spices sizzling in the wok behind me. The\
  \ fever was kicking in properly now, resulting in even more sweating than usual\
  \ for a farang baking on the roadside in Ho Chi Minh City. I clutched the bag from\
  \ the pharmacy and retraced my steps along this same stretch of road. I didn\u2019\
  t know how or where I crossed it earlier. I couldn\u2019t remember. The heat squeezed\
  \ my head. Piglets on spits turned greasily in the sun and men in conical hats smoked\
  \ around a doorway festooned with snaking cables. Motorbikes stampeded, careening\
  \ past, bearing riders and roses and a coffee table strapped across a passenger\u2019\
  s back with twine. The riders owned this road. The women, in thick elbow-length\
  \ gloves, hats and cotton face-masks, steered their beasts with stately grace. I\
  \ tentatively dipped a toe to the road again, losing my nerve when no gap materialized.\
  \ The bikes snarled and I leaped backwards onto the kerb feeling conspicuous and\
  \ silly that I couldn\u2019t get to the other side. Perspiration blurred my vision\
  \ and I heard giggling children. Their small shapes darted through somehow, though\
  \ I could barely look as they wove between the handlebars and hot mufflers. The\
  \ bikes came nine abreast in an infinite stream. I stared at the onslaught, wondering\
  \ if I was missing something, some trick. And then I looked down. A hand in my hand.\
  \ A tiny old lady, with thinning hair in a tight bun and a flapping dress, smiled\
  \ at me with eyes couched in wrinkles. She had apple cheeks like my grandmother.\
  \ I could see down onto her scalp, where the skin showed through her slicked-back\
  \ iron hair. She entwined her fingers in mine and without any signal she took me\
  \ out into the road. We went fast and slow, never fully stopping, as she marched\
  \ through the torrent of noise and motion. The bikes were on all sides as she danced\
  \ us over. She held out a knotted palm and we reached the far curb intact. She felt\
  \ like a grandmother, as she ran her thumb over mine before she let me go. The way\
  \ she pointed to the pharmacy bag before tapping my arm as if insisting I take my\
  \ medicine. Perhaps she recognized something in me too, beyond helplessness. She\
  \ dipped her head and adjusted her dress, pinching up its shoulders and then letting\
  \ them fall. She turned away and was suddenly gone in the crowd, the woman who battled\
  \ the bikes for me. Like most small acts of kindness, she never knew how much it\
  \ meant."
