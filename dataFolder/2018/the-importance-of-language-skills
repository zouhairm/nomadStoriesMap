Text: "\u201CBracelets, all silver! Ten dinar!\u201D\nI stepped back and averted my\
  \ eyes, having learned that eye contact with men wasn't wise for a young woman in\
  \ the Middle East, even if they were trying to sell you something. Failing to capture\
  \ my gaze, the robed man focused his efforts on my friend\u2014 \u201CSir! Sir!\
  \ Ten dinar for a bracelet for your wife, she will love you more!\u201D\nMy friend\
  \ shouldered past the man. I followed him, awkwardly. We were determined to see\
  \ as much of Petra as we could before it was time to return to the tour bus.\nThe\
  \ Treasury area was lovely, but crowded. Below the rosy splendor of sandstone cliff\
  \ carvings, countless visitors from around the world wandered, taking photos. Jordanian\
  \ entrepreneurs canvassed the crowds, selling everything from patterned rugs to\
  \ rides on camels and donkeys. I didn't feel the awe I'd anticipated. I expected\
  \ a historic site; this was a marketplace.\nAs I turned to avoid a postcard seller,\
  \ I wished for the tenth time that morning that I could explore the ancient Nabataean\
  \ stronghold alone\u2014 no tour group, no intrusive men hawking their wares, not\
  \ another human soul\u2014 just me, free to explore Petra\u2019s ruins at my leisure.\n\
  We trudged deeper into the stronghold, past various tombs and a stone theater. Sweat\
  \ ran freely down my back as we tried to slip by countless peddlers without interaction.\
  \ Men on camels kept trying to get my attention, their flattering words turning\
  \ into off-color jokes when I didn't acknowledge them.\nI felt drained and disturbed.\
  \ This was ridiculous! I wondered what would happen if they thought I didn't understand\
  \ them-- would they still try to sell me things? Perhaps it was time to put my Duolingo\
  \ lessons in Norwegian to good use.\nMinutes later, I was given an opportunity when\
  \ a man waved for my attention. I shook my head and walked on. \u201CDu er et sm\xF8\
  br\xF8d!\u201D\nHis gaze slid swiftly to a new victim, and I was left alone.\nI\
  \ felt untouchable! My friend lengthened his stride and looked at me curiously.\
  \ \u201CWhat did you tell him?\u201D\nI opened my mouth, then had to think\u2026\
  \ what had I actually said? The words had tumbled from my lips as if they were the\
  \ most natural thing, but I hadn\u2019t stopped to actually think them through...\n\
  My grin widened and I laughed. \u201CI told him he was a sandwich.\"\n\nWeeks later,\
  \ in Norway, I'd laugh again when I discovered that 90% of the population there\
  \ spoke fluent English. My language skills ended up being more useful to me in Jordan\
  \ than in Norway!"
