Text: "In the hot summer of 2008 I travelled to South India to visit the Parameswar\
  \ Secondary School project in Tamil Nadu. I spent three weeks visiting the place\
  \ and its surroundings, trying to impregnate myself from the culture and lives of\
  \ the young students and their families. I went to class with them, shared songs,\
  \ dances and games in the sandy playground. Every one of them was so happy to share\
  \ all these cultural differences with me and my sister and couldn\u2019t stop smiling\
  \ all the time. But there was one particularly smiley girl called Cabita who caught\
  \ my attention and whose I felt more connected with. \n\nOne day that we had cancelled\
  \ all the classes to play basketball all together, she took my hand and guided me\
  \ to a big rock apart from everyone. I saw a really old woman, who was almost lying\
  \ in that rock with difficulty to stand up and visibly marked because of the passage\
  \ of time. We couldn\u2019t understand each other, but thanks to the English classes\
  \ she had received at school, Cabita made me understand that the old woman was her\
  \ grandmother. I was told by the director of the center that Cabita was orphan,\
  \ that her unique family was her grandmother and that she was the poorest girl at\
  \ school. The old woman didn\u2019t know how to speak English, she was a pure Indian\
  \ without caste who knew her own language, Tamil. With all the weight of the imperturbable\
  \ and piercing sun on her body while grabbing strongly to the big rock just not\
  \ to fall, that woman gave me the biggest and sincerest smiles I\u2019ve ever seen.\
  \ Then I understood everything.\n\nSomething removed inside my heart in front of\
  \ that scene, which was really the last thing I expected. The brightness of the\
  \ woman\u2019s eyes was the one that Cabita owned and I was amazed and glad to know\
  \ that the strength and love of that grandmother had risen up an amazing person\
  \ with the joy of life inside herself despite the famine, poverty and all the difficulties\
  \ that life presented them day after day to survive. Cabita was also a non-caste\
  \ girl; in India they are considered the worst of the worst, the untouchable. And\
  \ there was I, staring at those incredible women: one who had already bitten the\
  \ hardness of life, and the other just beginning her early life as a woman in a\
  \ country where her voice could never be heard. And, among the thick smell of spices\
  \ that encompassed all around without letting you breathe, I could distinguish in\
  \ the old one the look of hope, of opportunity, of change on her precious granddaughter\u2019\
  s smile."
