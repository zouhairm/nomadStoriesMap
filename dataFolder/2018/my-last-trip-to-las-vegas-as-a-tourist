Text: "It was September 2010. My husband was attending a conference in Las Vegas,\
  \ the hub of huge conferences. We had been to Vegas once before so we were not too\
  \ keen on the gambling scene but we really wanted to check out Grand Canyon and\
  \ figure out what the big deal was. \n\nWe thought it would probably be the last\
  \ time we would make it out here in Vegas. We were not sure if Vegas would ever\
  \ fit in our plans again. We wanted to plan kids and kids do not fit with Vegas,\
  \ we thought. \n\nAfter 5 hours of driving, we made our way to the beautiful Grand\
  \ Canyon - South Rim. It was as grand as we had heard about. The sunset across the\
  \ canyon was mesmerizing. The weather was cool but thankfully I had a shawl and\
  \ of course my husband\u2019s hugs. \n\nFor a tourist spot that attracts millions\
  \ of visitors yearly, it did not have a lot of restaurant options. We found a small\
  \ local italian restaurant and had a nice pasta and wine dinner. \n\nThe next day\
  \ we woke up early and toured the area. We were not very well equipped to hike so\
  \ we just hopped on and off the bus tour. It was interesting to see the hikers look\
  \ like ants from the top. My mind even wandered to the thought of how these hikers\
  \ manage to not fall and come back alive.\n\nWe drove back to Las Vegas later that\
  \ evening. We were staying at the MGM hotel. We decided to spend the nights doing\
  \ what all tourists do. The sounds of winning on the slot machines, the lights,\
  \ the crowd, the drunk crazy people, it was all mesmerizing. Of course, this was\
  \ possibly the last time we would ever be in this place. So why not, live it up?\n\
  \nWhen I had first come to Las Vegas before this, I had not liked it. I thought\
  \ it was too dry, too bright and just outright weird. But this time, it felt more\
  \ lively. I think which hotel you stay in and what you do throughout the trip can\
  \ make a difference in your opinion in this town. \n\nOn a very high note (pun intended),\
  \ we called an end to our long fun night. The next morning, we woke up all ready\
  \ to go back to our North Carolina home. As we sat on the plane, I looked out through\
  \ the window. I saw a sign of UNLV. I wondered who went to study here in Vegas?\
  \ \n\nWhen I had said that, the last thing I expected was to move to Las Vegas.\
  \ But oh we did. 8 months later, life brought us to Las Vegas again. \n\nWe became\
  \ locals and stayed there for about 7 years. My husband did go to UNLV for part\
  \ of his law school. I called Vegas home and had both my kids here. Funny how things\
  \ happen so different in life than we ever expect them to be."
