Text: "Two chickens and a grumpy goat dashed past me through the narrow doorway as\
  \ I peered inside the hut. Dust whirled up behind them and into my lungs. Loosely\
  \ stacked bricks lined the perimeter and a brown thatched roof sat crookedly on\
  \ top of the makeshift family home.\n\nApart from a stack of firewood in a smoky\
  \ corner, the hut only contained wooden slats that doubled as beds. Lacking an outdoor\
  \ pen, the family was forced to share their home with the creatures. The pungent\
  \ smell of dung wafted from under the beds and filled my nostrils. \u201CPlease,\
  \ more water!\u201D his voice came from outside.\n\nI turned and made my way to\
  \ the man knee-deep in mud. Handing him another bucket of water, I watched as five\
  \ boys helped him mix it into the wet ground. His hands, cracked like the earth\
  \ around him, held a rusty shovel tightly. It was hard to imagine that just four\
  \ months ago, this rural village was completely submerged in water.\n\nPatihani\
  \ was just one village among 26 Nepalese districts to be hit with severe flooding\
  \ in 2017. 70 people lost their lives; 60,000 lost their homes. \n\nThe man nodded\
  \ a thank you in my direction, but his eyes didn\u2019t meet mine. As he bent back\
  \ down, I gaped at the hundreds of houses beyond his \u2013 tattered and temporary.\
  \ How does a country where people can\u2019t afford to eat rebuild itself? Where\
  \ labourers already work dawn til dusk, barefoot, for a meagre 500 rupees a day?\
  \ A country still recuperating from a 7.8 magnitude earthquake just two years ago,\
  \ which claimed the lives of almost 9,000? How does one rebuild something from nothing?\n\
  \nA little girl with pigtails looked over her shoulder at me, grinned, and yanked\
  \ out some loose bricks. I watched as she passed them to labourers; brick by brick.\
  \ The whole village was there. Men stacked bricks while women used their hands as\
  \ trowels to spread sticky mud over them. Inquisitive youngsters giggled as they\
  \ examined shell-shocked lizards whose hiding holes had been exposed under bricks.\
  \ \n\nWe had intended to buy the children school uniforms, but when we arrived in\
  \ Patihani we found ourselves standing in silence among the sea of dilapidated homes.\
  \ Which is why, 24 hours later, we found ourselves in a muddy production line instead\
  \ of fitting clothes for school.\n\nA tiny boy with big brown eyes dangled from\
  \ the handle of a water pump. It didn\u2019t budge. \u201CMore water?\u201D I asked,\
  \ pumping the handle for him.\n \nHow does one rebuild something from nothing? One\
  \ doesn\u2019t. A community does. Piece by piece... brick by brick."
