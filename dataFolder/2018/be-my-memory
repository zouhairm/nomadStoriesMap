Text: "It's too late to write poems when the dream poem went away; has strayed through\
  \ frequent insomnia or perhaps through the frequency of illusions. And the soul?\
  \ What do I do with him when, in exchange for his aspirations, he is destroyed by\
  \ a profound mischief? I only have to lose myself with him.  \nIt's February again\
  \ in my memories. You are my February, just as cold and abandoned. Please, come\
  \ back in August. Come back in August, with your sea smell and the eternal thought\
  \ of continuity. Today the ocean is deserted, even the color is gone. \nOne day\
  \ ago, the bright sky dominated the city. The only remaining sunbeams are lost.\
  \ The sun blinded the passers-by. \nI started attending the painting classes again\
  \ on Tuesday afternoon, a good opportunity to relax and let my imagination run wild.\
  \ But nothing changed in the painting room. As usual, the same colorless atmosphere,\
  \ the same walls that do not inspire. \nWith a half pencil, I drew a dark face.\
  \ It was him, without name and heart. I was sure that the boy from my painting was\
  \ real and that I will meet him in one of my travels. Meanwhile, the teacher, a\
  \ beautiful woman, 40 years old but still living alone, stared at me and shouted\

  \ compassionate eyes turned against me. \n\"I'm really fine!\" \nAt that moment,\
  \ she stared at me with wide eyes. \n\"Do not you see how happy I am?\" \nSuddenly,\
  \ I threw the brush out of the dusty window and ran lightning fast to the exit.\
  \ I needed air. I needed to found him.\n\"Ella ...?!\" \nI did not go to the painting\
  \ for a few days. I stayed in the apartment, away from the winter breeze and the\
  \ passers-by. Every attempt to survive failed. \nIt was 5:00 in the morning. The\
  \ city was still in full sleep. Although the moon was the master of the night, he\
  \ could not overcome the darkness. The light left slowly, slowly the lanterns. On\
  \ the main street of the neighborhood only light appeared in a window.  In a black\
  \ satchel with gold zipper I left an apple, a water bottle and my color palette.\
  \ I'm going to an unknown destination. Actually I knew exactly where I wanted to\
  \ go. I changed the course of the road to the opposite side and at an obscene speed\
  \ I head to the shore of the Argentine sea. I was slowly approaching the waves of\
  \ water, the cold smell of the shore. Right at that moment my adventure began because\
  \ I saw that what is forbidden ..."
