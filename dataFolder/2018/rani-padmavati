Text: "The Chittorgarh fort was in the shape of a fish, with 65 historic structures,\
  \ 84 water bodies, 7 large gates...  But I was interested in none of it. I headed\
  \ straight to the kund.\n\u201CRani Padmavati was the most beautiful princess of\
  \ Chittor.\u201D The cicerone with his colorful turban was animatedly telling his\
  \ group of tourists. \u201CRawal Ratan Singh had first heard of her beauty from\
  \ a parrot\u2026\u201D\nIt was one of those famous legends that talked of Rajput\
  \ honor. The men would rather get their heads severed than bowed. The women would\
  \ rather jump into the fire than be taken prisoners.\nThe word was jauhar. The ultimate\
  \ test of pride. \n\u201CEnthused cheers accompanied Rani Padmavati bedecked in\
  \ gold wedding finery while the crackling fire devoured her.\u201D The guide continued.\
  \  \nThe dry desert winds of Chittor had leached my face of any moisture it may\
  \ have had whereas my hair felt extra sticky after the dune bashing I had just had\
  \ in the open jeep. But it was nothing compared to the shivers that crept up my\
  \ spine in broad daylight when I stared into the kund.  \nThe enormous and blackened\
  \ kund where women burnt themselves alive when their husbands were killed. Out of\
  \ their own pride or societal propriety, I would never know.\nIt reeked of an inflated\
  \ sense of prestige and a firm hand on women where even the queen was supposed to\
  \ walk two paces behind the king. But then, has history ever been fair?\nThe woman\
  \ who accompanied the guide was clad in the brightest red skirt with the shiniest\
  \ of little mirrors on it.\n\u201CHas this place always been so crowded?\u201D I\
  \ asked her as she collected tips from anyone who would care to photograph her.\n\
  \u201CSince the ban.\u201D\nOf course, the ban on the movie had precipitated this.\
  \ The Karni Sena had claimed that their \u201Cqueen\u201D was being shown in a bad\
  \ light, thus demanding that it be banned in the state of Rajasthan.\n\u201CWhen\
  \ Alauddin Khilji showed his lecherous side seeking Rani Padmavati, she jumped into\
  \ the fire\u2026\u201D the woman narrated.\nThere was pride in her voice. And hurt.\
  \ Hurt pride that their queen had been objectified by the rogue invader Khilji.\
  \ \nAs the scorching sun turned melony and drooped to hide behind the fort, I felt\
  \ like telling the woman that Rani Padmavati was being objectified even today. By\
  \ the group of people who had taken it upon themselves to take offense because \u201C\
  their\u201D queen, their possession, their symbol of honor had been projected in\
  \ an unfavorable light.\nBut the proud Rajput woman would have none of it. She was\
  \ in another era altogether."
