Text: "Stepping off the plane after 48 hours of arduous (to say the least) travel\
  \ to reach solid ground in Havana felt like a God send. I\u2019d had less than five\
  \ hours sleep in the past two days, travelled through 4 countries, 6 airports and\
  \ lost my temper at 3 rambunctious children, but I\u2019d finally landed in this\
  \ city I\u2019d fantasised about.\n\nIt was close to midnight and 3 planes had arrived\
  \ at once to the tiny Havana airport. Madness ensued. With no English speaking staff\
  \ and limited signage it became clear that my peque\xF1ito knowledge of the language\
  \ wasn\u2019t going to get me far. A lesson I learned much more wholeheartedly during\
  \ my week in Cuba. \n\nThe last thing I expected was then for the security staff\
  \ to saunter out looking like dancers from a 90\u2019s film clip. Had I fallen asleep\
  \ from travel exhaustion? Khaki dresses, heels, fishnets and lipstick. I sat back\
  \ waiting for film cameras to appear. But alas, the Havanan airport security were\
  \ to be taken VERY seriously. Girl Power.\n\nAfter an ordeal at baggage collection,\
  \ every passenger filed out to the two cash tellers. Cuban currency isn\u2019t available\
  \ outside of Cuba; we all proceeded to form two lengthy lines. After an hour wait\
  \ period, to the heartbroken dismay of the travelers, one teller clocked off. The\
  \ scene felt like something from a slapstick comedy. I chuckled to myself, exasperated.\
  \ \n\nThe pushy taxi drivers, descended on the weary. Reluctantly, I piled myself\
  \ in to the back seat of the cab of the most high spirited driver I\u2019d ever\
  \ had the pleasure, or confusion, of meeting. In ecstatic broken English, he introduced\
  \ me to his girlfriend in the front seat; mentioning he\u2019d first met her salsa\
  \ dancing. The night before. \n\nHe asked if I liked music. Yes, something Cuban\
  \ I could connect with. At which point he blasted what could be described as electro\
  \ reggaeton, as he sped down the highway way over what any speed limit should be.\
  \ His speedometer was broken.\n\nWindows down and a very fast Bob Marley ringing\
  \ in my ears, I soaked in the sights whizzing past me in the darkness, laughing.\
  \ What on EARTH was this crazy place?!\n\nReaching La Habana in the early hours,\
  \ we weaved backstreets awash with people and music playing. This city was just\
  \ as alive in the darkness as mine would be in the day. Trying to find the Casa\
  \ Particular where my dear elderly host was wrapped in her dressing gown, was another\
  \ challenge. I was told to expect the unexpected in Cuba; if my first 3 hours wasn't\
  \ evidence enough, nothing ever would be."
