Text: "You can never prepare for the moment when the life will decide to test you.\n\
  \nIn 2013, shooting in the dark, I decided to go with a group of tourists on a hiking\
  \ trip to Abkhazia, a disputed territory on the eastern coast of the Black Sea.\n\
  \nI rented a place which turned out to be a half-ruined house high above the sea\
  \ owned by an old lady. Former Russian language teacher, she had no kids and made\
  \ her living by receiving tourists. After a war of secession with Georgia, there\
  \ wasn\u2019t much job in the city. All people, as well as buildings and infrastructure,\
  \ seemed to be stuck in postwar times. Covered with the traces of gunshots houses\
  \ sank in blooming nature, and locals sat along the only paved road in country.\n\
  \nMy neighbors decided to go to a market to taste some wine. They brought a bottle\
  \ with them to our place. Hostess treated me as a granddaughter, so she warned me\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t drink the alcohol here if you\u2019re not sure how it was made\u201D\
  . One part of me wanted to listen to her but the other wanted to rush into a culinary\
  \ journey. So I compromised: there would be no harm in one sip. It was the worst\
  \ decision ever.\n\nI got a food poisoning, and was running from my bed to bathroom\
  \ all night. Then I\u2019ve got a fever, and it was right 6 hours before the start\
  \ of the hiking trip. Hostess was running around me praying and trying to forbid\
  \ me to go. She called an ambulance but they told us to get to the hospital by a\
  \ taxi. Being stubborn, I couldn\u2019t put up with the fact that I won\u2019t be\
  \ able to go to the mountains. So I started to pack my backpack. Half-conscious,\
  \ of course. \nOld woman decided to help me and called my guides to pick me up.\
  \ I got into a car with a huge sheep-dog and three serious looking men while she\
  \ was crying and waving goodbye. I still barely remember how we got to the meeting\
  \ point but when we got there my only thought was \u201CI\u2019m not gonna make\
  \ it\u201D.\n\nThat day after a sleepless night I walked 12 kilometers with an empty\
  \ stomach. I couldn\u2019t pay attention nor to my group, nor to the charming landscape\
  \ around me. By the late evening when we got to our camping place I was devastated.\
  \ Exhausted, I fell asleep.\n\nBut all my struggles turned out to be worth it. I\
  \ almost pushed the limits but the efforts were rewarding. The first thing I saw\
  \ in the morning was a smoky mountain and the meadow covered with sleeping flowers.\
  \ The wind blew but everything was still and silent. The sun-drenched world was\
  \ full of harmony, and I felt ready to conquer peaks. Again."
