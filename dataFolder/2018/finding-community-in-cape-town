Text: "In June of 2013, I joined the company of six other college students to volunteer\
  \ for the non-governmental organization Happy Feet Youth Project in the township\
  \ of Langa in Cape Town, South Africa. The organization promotes creativity, independence,\
  \ and leadership by emphasizing the importance of discipline and honing one\u2019\
  s unique talents to better oneself and one\u2019s community. I began my journey\
  \ by wondering how a traveler connects rather than simply surveys; I did not want\
  \ to adopt a flippant tourist\u2019s attitude. I hoped to make a sustainable impact\
  \ that encouraged children to trust in themselves and find success on their own\
  \ terms despite the obstacles of living in a low-income area and in the wake of\
  \ the fairly recent abolishment of apartheid. \n\nWe were generously welcomed in\
  \ Langa, living in our host families\u2019 spare bedrooms to serve as elementary\
  \ school teachers, daycare workers, and after school leaders.  We lived and worked\
  \ among residents, learning the distinction between traveling and remaining a tourist\
  \ who merely snaps photographs for the sake of claiming one was there. We sampled\
  \ long sips of traditional sour Umqombothi beer in a metal pail and were shown how\
  \ a smiley--sheep head meat--is cooked and stripped over smoldering fires. We taught\
  \ elementary language and math lessons in the mornings and made dinner for children\
  \ at the end of each day after an afternoon of playing soccer and finishing homework.\
  \ We danced to the original beats of the young dancers\u2019 drums, clapping hands,\
  \ joyous chants, and heavy stomping of gumboots. We shared intimate details of our\
  \ lives and stories with one another in broken English and Xhosa.\n\nWe sampled\
  \ local wines in Stellenbosch and traveled to see the resplendent views awarded\
  \ by destinations such as Table Mountain, Lion's Head, Boulders Beach, and Cape\
  \ of Good Hope. We strolled down busy market streets lined with vibrant jewelry\
  \ and intricate carvings on our rest days. However, the bonds we made in Langa--the\
  \ small hands I held and quick feet I fruitlessly attempted to keep in tempo with--stay\
  \ with me most. When I think of the time spent in Cape Town, I hear the laughter\
  \ in their voices wondering why I cannot click my tongue to the full pops of Xhosa\
  \ phrases as we sip hot rooibos tea around heat lamps during the dreary, wet evenings\
  \ of South Africa\u2019s winter. Spending shared moments with this community pulled\
  \ me out of my Western, private comfort zone and literally into the arms of dozens\
  \ of warmhearted children."
