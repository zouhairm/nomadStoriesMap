Text: "Bombing down the Kinabatangan River, the sporadic shrieks emanating from our\
  \ guide (that may be animal noises, or perhaps he\u2019s just singing) are clearly\
  \ audible over the loudly thrumming engine. Oh the serenity! Mind you, if he\u2019\
  s good enough for Sir David Attenborough, he\u2019s good enough for us. \n\nToday\
  \ our goal is to see Pygmy Elephants from the boat. Rumour has it the Sultan of\
  \ Sulu was once gifted some from Java. They got out, established themselves in Sabah\
  \ and, in a curious twist of fate, survived longer than the originals in Java, now\
  \ considered extinct.  \n\nDown river we're surprised to be ushered out of the boat\
  \ and through 10 foot high grass flattened in great swathes. Huge un-pygmy looking\
  \ piles of dung steam gently. \u201CSssssh!\u201D Says our guide. \u201CElephants!\u201D\
  \ My heart feels like it\u2019s trying to climb out of my chest as a deep roar echoes\
  \ through the jungle. It sounds a lot like a boat motor. Actually, scratch that,\
  \ it sounds like a monster. An ear-splitting trumpeting noise shatters the air and\
  \ I begin to feel like I have a leading role in Jurassic park. \n\nA friend once\
  \ told me the thing to do if an elephant chases you is take off your clothes. The\
  \ elephant will trample them first. And run downhill, their knees can\u2019t take\
  \ downhill speed. The only downhill here is the 3 foot riverbank. The river has\
  \ salt water crocodiles in it. \n\n\u201CRelax!\u201D Says our guide. I try. He\
  \ knows his stuff. He\u2019s taken Attenborough here. Attenborough is still alive.\
  \ And they're pygmy, right? \u201CCome! When I say run, you know the way to the\
  \ boat?\u201D WHEN you say run?! Suddenly, ears wide, trunk swinging, an elephant\
  \ breaks through the thicket ahead. And she is not pygmy. She\u2019s bloody huge!\n\
  \nFollowed by her herd she rushes us \u201CRun! Run!! Back to the boat! RUN!!\u201D\
  \ yells our guide. I run. Soon all I can hear is my own labored breathing. Everything\
  \ feels magnified. I feel shaky, but poised. I suspect this is actual fight or flight\
  \ mode. My body gearing itself up to do exactly what eons of evolution designed\
  \ it for. \n\nThe roars intensify. And there she is again. \u201CRun, RUN! Faster!!\
  \ Go GO!\u201D yells The Boyfriend. Am I even going the right way? Panting, I throw\
  \ myself into the boat. Closely followed by The Boyfriend. Who is somehow bleeding,\
  \ covered in mud. His t-shirt, face, everywhere. \u201CWhat the hell happened to\
  \ you?\u201D I ask. He looks at his bleeding feet and mud caked torso, \u201CErm,\
  \ I was chased by elephants?\u201D he explains. The intensity of living rings deliriously\
  \ through tears of laughter."
