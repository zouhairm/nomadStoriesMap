Text: "\u2018Was it your first time?\u2019\n\nHer voice was not how I expected it\
  \ to be. Slightly courser and deeper than her small frame would suggest, with an\
  \ accent I couldn\u2019t quite place. European, maybe. Out of habit I nodded, before\
  \ realising I could finally speak.\n\n\u2018I like your shirt.\u2019 She laughed.\
  \ With my Filipino face and Australian accent, I suppose that was not what she was\
  \ expecting either after ten days of silent company.\n\nI met her on day one at\
  \ chore time.\n\nThankful I did not end up with toilet duty for my ten days here,\
  \ I grabbed the mops we had been given whilst ducking my head gravely with obvious\
  \ sympathy as I passed by those less fortunate. A shadow moved along the forecourt\
  \ in front of me and I looked up to see a girl, smiling as she reached across me\
  \ for a mop. She wore fisherman pants and a track jersey with the name of what I\
  \ assumed was her university. I smiled back.\n\nLater that night fire ants stormed\
  \ into my bed, following the scent of the crumby remains of my last sweet indulgence\
  \ before I signed myself up to the confines of the hermitage. It was a literal sting\
  \ in the arse \u2013 just in case the hard, concrete slab of a mattress was not\
  \ enough of a welcome. Scrambling up in pain and fists clenched, I yelped, but my\
  \ voice shrunk in obedience to the rules of the silent retreat until my frustration\
  \ slowly petered out into the night and the ominous peal of the bell rolled in to\
  \ signal a new day. \n\nRoutine eased my initial teething pains as I adjusted into\
  \ the rhythm of the monastery alongside my new friend, the track runner. The shag\
  \ of my mop swished across the floor in silent choreography with the runner girl\
  \ as our mops met from across the hall each day. No talking. No reading. No exercise.\
  \ We would sit, meditating, and I followed the wind running through the grass, rustling\
  \ the trees that grasped at the sun, as silence birthed life anew, regardless of\
  \ our voices not being amongst it. Within the confines of the refuge we seemed so\
  \ far away from the cacophony of the world that rushed around it.\n\nFinally, after\
  \ ten days, we stood across each other, our bags packed and having just been dismissed.\
  \ The path I entered through ten days ago weaved up the hills in the distance, and\
  \ I envisaged the sounds of the outside world welcoming us: touters bellowing in\
  \ Thai, tuk-tuk drivers weaving through and the sound of the ferry heaving in to\
  \ send us off.\n\n\u2018Well, all the best out there.\u2019\n\nWith that I watched\
  \ her run ahead of me, breaking into a sprint with the wind."
