Text: "The sewage smell beneath the beachfront bridge connecting Leblon and Ipanema,\
  \ two of Rio's most posh districts, didn't bother me.  I still swam in the ocean\
  \ every day, chilling between dips near Lifeguard Tower 9 with an aca'i or a caipirinha\
  \ served by roving hawkers, watching surfers and volleyball players and ladies in\
  \ skimpy tangas from behind my sunglasses.  \"Posto Nove\" on Ipanema Beach is Rio's\
  \ most famous outdoor meat market, and I'm not talking about the churrasco.\n\n\
  I didn't put two and two together until hostile bacteria took up residence in a\
  \ cut on my right index finger.  It was the worst pain of my life.  If I bumped\
  \ my right hand even slightly, I doubled over in agony.  Suspecting staph or strep\
  \ from the sewage actually gave me hope.  My body responds well to penicillin. \
  \ If that was the treatment, I might be back in fighting shape in time for Carnaval.\n\
  \nAccording to Google, a certain Dr. Campos of Copacabana ran a clinic with English-speaking\
  \ staff.  I spent the bus ride from Vidigal to Copa between 7 and 9 on the pain\
  \ scale.  My finger had swollen like a tire.  Cradling the unhappy digit, I ascended\
  \ one flight of stairs off Ave. Nossa Senhora and found myself in a tiny clinic\
  \ waiting room, clerked by a beautiful young nurse.  She struggled in English to\
  \ ask me what was wrong, wrote something down on a clipboard, and told me to wait.\n\
  \nIn less than ten minutes, middle-aged Dr. Campos emerged, glancing at a chart\
  \ and looking impatient.  He ushered me through a curtain to the exam room and sat\
  \ me down on the table, still palpably annoyed. \n\n\"So,\" he said in clipped,\
  \ accented English.  \"You have pain and swelling in your penis ... any discharge?\"\
  \n\nI blinked, flabbergasted.  \"No ... no, not my penis.\"  My mind went back to\
  \ the pretty receptionist and her clipboard.  \"Not my penis.  My finger.  Meu dedo!\
  \  Meu dedo!\"  I augmented my weak Portuguese by helpfully waving the afflicted\
  \ finger in his face.\n\nDr. Campos was briefly confused ... then suddenly relieved\
  \ and cheerful.  \"Oh!  It says 'penis' on here.  That's different.  Let's have\
  \ a look.\"\n\nI left the clinic with a scrip for amoxicillin, which erased the\
  \ pain in 48 hours like I had hoped.  What stuck with me, though, was the 180-degree\
  \ change in Dr. Campos' mood.  I think I understood what had been going through\
  \ his head before I cleared everything up: \"I have to look at the dripping genitals\
  \ of another stupid gringo who has never heard of condoms?  I hate Carnaval ...\""
