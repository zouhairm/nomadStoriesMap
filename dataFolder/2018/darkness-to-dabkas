Text: "In November, I traveled to Berlin where the hot news topic is the refugee crisis.\
  \  I was fascinated that a country with such a chilling history was accepting more\
  \ Syrian refugees than anywhere in the world. (A result of guilt?)\n\nI visited\
  \ Tempelhofer Feld, a decommissioned airport. Used by the Nazis during World War\
  \ II, West Germany during the Cold War, and finally as a commercial airport, the\
  \ City of Berlin left its future use up to its citizens in 2008. They chose public\
  \ space. I had never seen an airport-as-public-space before. The former runways\
  \ were bike, jogging, and kitesurfing paths. The surrounding grassy areas were perfect\
  \ for picnics and a wildlife refuge sat further afield. Beyond nature, I saw seemingly\
  \ out of place modular buildings near the hangar. \n\n\"What are they?\" \nRefugee\
  \ housing. \n\nWhat? \nRefugees were living in the airport? I got chills. \n\nI\
  \ saw a sign for a \u201Cmeet and greet\u201D event with refugees. It struck me\
  \ as odd. Is this a mutually beneficial thing? Curiosity got the best of me.\n\n\
  I arrived alone to a small home office and was greeted by Aihan. A former lawyer\
  \ from Syria, he walked (\u201Cwalked\u201D was his word; later, it was also apparent\
  \ that he meant ran, hopped, crawled, hid) to Germany. Upon arrival, he started\
  \ language classes with the goal of speaking well enough to go to a German law school.\
  \ In his two years, Aihan has a firm grasp of German and English and serves as a\
  \ bridge between the Syrian and German communities. While I was in his office, he\
  \ helped connect a Syrian family to a washing machine that had just been donated.\
  \ \n\nAihan and I clicked. I was surprised by how open he was: how he\u2019s afraid\
  \ he will never see his mother again, how he\u2019s been trying to get his girlfriend\
  \ over. When we neared the end of our time together, Aiham invited me to his birthday\
  \ party. Of course, I would go.  \n\nThere, I spoke with his roommates, two smart,\
  \ young men (also recently arrived from Syria) who shared their scary tales of escape\
  \ over treacherous seas. But it was mostly a night of celebrating. Aiham told me\
  \ I must eat because he had been cooking his favorite Syrian foods for days (and\
  \ DAMN, they were good.) The Syrians joyously pulled us into impromptu dabkas (Middle\
  \ Eastern circle dances); the sweet smell of apple tobacco filled the small flat.\n\
  \nI was teary most of the night. It was a moment of connections: seeing a dark history\
  \ relive itself in a new context. But more importantly, the spirit to live and find\
  \ joy eternally shines brightest."
