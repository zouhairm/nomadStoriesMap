Text: "Years of studying cumulated into a single accomplishment. I was accepted to\
  \ Pitt. Majoring in astrophysics, my sights were set on becoming an astronaut. So\
  \ dropping my classes one year later and buying a one-way ticket to Thailand was\
  \ the last thing I expected.\nOnly 20, I knew less about myself than there was yet\
  \ to discover. I knew I liked writing but I wrote for myself, and only myself. My\
  \ notebook was an alternate universe I could escape to and be who I wanted to be\
  \ with absolute freedom and no judgments of this alternate me.\nBefore my trip,\
  \ I was working as a waitress to save money. One customer was intrigued by my upcoming\
  \ travels.\n\u201CYou\u2019re a writer, aren\u2019t you?\u201D He could tell by\
  \ the way I held my pen. \u201CYou must write a blog about your journey!\u201D he\
  \ exclaimed.\nI told him, \"Oh, no I don't share my writing.\"\n\u201CYou\u2019\
  re going on a trip that 100% of people want to go on but only 10% will. The 90%\
  \ of us want to hear about it,\u201D he said. With that, I became a travel writer.\
  \ I could hardly believe it as I set up a blog and began writing, publicly, to the\
  \ online world.\nMy life headed down a road with unexpected turn after another and,\
  \ finally, I was beginning to feel alive. I watched the sunset over the periwinkle\
  \ waves of the Andaman Sea; a body of water I thought would only exist on a map.\
  \ I walked through the bustling rows of the Thong Sala market, igniting my palette\
  \ with exotic flavors. I woke in a bungalow having to decide whether to spend the\
  \ day hiking to a waterfall or practicing Muay Thai with a World Muay Thai Champion.\
  \ I walked across the world\u2019s largest religious monument, Angkor Wat; dazzling\
  \ at the detailed architecture done over 2,000 years ago. I spent my birthday whipping\
  \ a quad through the sand dunes of Mui Ne. I did yoga in a cave that was once used\
  \ for storing ammunition for the Vietnam war. I rock climbed limestone mountains\
  \ in Halong Bay. I became a Mahoot for a day, caring for elephants. And I wrote\
  \ about each and every wonderful, or not-so-wonderful, moment.\nThe blog was a surprising\
  \ success. I worked hard to write often enough to keep up with the demands from\
  \ my readers. I was touched. It felt like the me that hid between the pages of my\
  \ notebook was finding a place in this world. At the end of my trip, I danced under\
  \ a full moon and creative expressions came pouring out of me. The freedom found\
  \ in my writing was radiating from the inside out, destroying my comfort zone. Then,\
  \ the last thing I ever expected happened. The World met my soul."
