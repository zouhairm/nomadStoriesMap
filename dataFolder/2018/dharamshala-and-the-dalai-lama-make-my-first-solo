Text: "They say, \u2018desperate times call for desperate measures\u2019, and I was\
  \ in no less need to shake off the corporate burnout and the monotony of a city\
  \ life. So, while indecision loomed large over me\u2014should I travel alone or\
  \ wait for my friends to agree for a weekend trip\u2014I took a plunge I had been\
  \ meaning to take for long. I packed my bags, hopped on to a bus and left for a\
  \ trip right in the middle of a workweek.\nI was a bundle of nerves until what calmed\
  \ me was the crisp smell of lush greenery, the cool breath of whispering breeze\
  \ and the happy unhurried poise that I immediately felt on reaching the Tibetan\
  \ town of Mcleodganj.\nThe quaint suburban town of Mcleodganj, nestled in the higher\
  \ climes of Dharamshala, is a popular getaway oasis among north Indians\u2014pocket-friendly\
  \ and charmingly beautiful. With no itinerary to keep, I wandered along the length\
  \ of the Jogiwara Road that wraps this town like a scarf. Makeshift stalls garland\
  \ the winding main street selling Tibetan curios and semiprecious gems. Well-situated\
  \ hotels along the hill slopes are in plenty, but the view of the majestic Lower\
  \ Himalayas set against the backdrop of clear skies and rolling clouds is guaranteed\
  \ from any part of Mcleod.\nIt was pleasantly nice to enjoy a few songs, some stories\
  \ and a few tips for my stay with the three local friends I made in an eatery. With\
  \ walks, little chats with locals and the mesmerising natural landscape filling\
  \ my days, I couldn\u2019t have been more relaxed and further away from stress.\n\
  The seat of exiled Tibetans in India, Dharamshala is criss-crossed with colourful\
  \ prayer flags and dotted with Tibetan monasteries. The main temple of Tibetan Buddhism\
  \ or the Tsulagkhang Temple lies at the heart of Mcleodganj. The last thing that\
  \ I had expected on this trip was to meet the Dalai Lama and take home one of the\
  \ valuable life lessons. Excited to hear him speak, I sat along with the monks and\
  \ tourists. But half hour into it, restlessness got the better of me. Until a large\
  \ hand held my fidgety ones and said in a warm assuring voice, \u2018Let it go.\
  \ You have nothing to worry.\u2019 With wonder I took in the smiling face of the\
  \ old monk sitting beside me and slowly felt something heavy slipping away. I soaked\
  \ in the peaceful calmness and wisdom that the Dalai Lama shared, but what I learnt\
  \ more was to let go.\nVagabonding up and downhill this town was amazingly satisfying\
  \ and peaceful, even though I was alone. Perhaps, I learnt more of myself travelling\
  \ alone than I ever did before."
