Text: "The bravest decision I\u2019ve ever made while traveling didn\u2019t even have\
  \ to do with the trip we were on at the time. It\u2019s a silly, embarrassing hang-up\
  \ I have, that gets in the way of me telling stories about my trips the way I want\
  \ to. \nLet me explain. \nThere\u2019s a girl from school whose Instagram looks\
  \ like I wished mine did. Her summer vacation selfies are always in bikinis, boating\
  \ and/or waterskiing in exotic places. In each picture, she is lean and tan, toned,\
  \ and smiling with perfectly aligned teeth. Her dishevelment is always artistic.\
  \ She could be paid to promote anything from skincare products to yoga mats.\nI\
  \ kind of hate her.\nBut I hate myself more, I think. In the middle of my last trip,\
  \ to Houston with family, I was taking picture after picture at the zoo. We saw\
  \ the sea lions barking at each other, baby giraffes, and we imitated the exotic\
  \ birds. But I took only one picture of myself that entire day. And when I went\
  \ to write up my post, I didn\u2019t want to post it. \nI am not beautiful. My face\
  \ is pink and round. My hair is short and practical. I hate my huge thighs and my\
  \ prominent hips, and really everything about myself that isn\u2019t smooth and\
  \ elegant.\nSo when I go to put up the pictures from my trips, I only want to show\
  \ off the place. I only want to show the birds, the statues, the view of the sky\
  \ at dusk. And I won\u2019t for a second want to commemorate that I was the person\
  \ who was there, seeing it. I ought to look beautiful to be seen with these beautiful\
  \ places, right? All these things that I can do, and I still think that I have to\
  \ look like a model to be able to tell people that I went somewhere and enjoyed\
  \ it.\nWhich is such nonsense. \nSo when I wrote up that trip, I put my selfie front\
  \ and center. That\u2019s brave. That\u2019s stupid. It terrified me\u2014but I\
  \ was at the Houston zoo that day, and I had a great time. And no matter what I\
  \ look like, I get to enjoy that. \nDealing with body image issues like this is\
  \ my number one obstacle in travel writing. I\u2019ll hike and climb and zip-line\
  \ away, but the hardest, most dangerous thing for me is to post a picture of myself\
  \ on the internet doing those cool and amazing things. That\u2019s why my biggest\
  \ decision as a travel writer has been to say \u201CNo way Jose\u201D to those thoughts\
  \ and put up my pictures anyway. My life is not a product. I have the right to joy,\
  \ the right to happiness, and the right to exist as I am. Now, if I\u2019m enjoying\
  \ myself, I promised myself, no matter how I feel: I will Just. Take. The. Picture."
