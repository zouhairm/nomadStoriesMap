Text: "Exploring a new place for the first time gives one a feeling so deep, it shakes\
  \ the soul. Leaving behind a small piece of ourselves, only aching to return again\
  \ soon.Growing up, I had one dream: to see the world and the cultures residing in\
  \ far away places. To wrap myself up like a warm blanket with knowledge and  language\
  \ of life that was different from my own. I didn't have a game plan, I just knew\
  \ I needed to go. It wasn't until I moved to Los Angeles that an opportunity to\
  \ fulfill my dream occurred. I was at work, just another normal sunny day, when\
  \ my manager came in and asked us a question that changed my life. \"There is an\
  \ extra spot on our Italy trip, who wants to go?\" I don't think the words were\
  \ even completed, my hand was in the air. That was my moment. My dream was about\
  \ to be a reality. Six strangers embarked on an adventure a month later. We landed\
  \ in Rome, and quickly got on the speed train into Florence. There are no words\
  \ when one arrives in Florence, no simple emotion to describe. It is a feeling of\
  \ peace, love, happiness, togetherness. its a feeling of never wanting to leave.\
  \ It feels like home. I knew at that moment that I was made to see this amazing\
  \ world. Sitting on the steps of Piazzale Michelangelo, pink, yellow and a light\
  \ blue blended into the hills of Tuscany on our left and cascaded into Florence\
  \ on our right. I could've sat there forever. My heart felt heavy, knowing I couldn't.\
  \ \nThe six strangers quickly became six friends. In our AirBNB, on the local side\
  \ of Florence, was small cafe and an open terrace where locals gathered late at\
  \ night. All of them were so kind and welcoming, helping us with our Italian, laughing\
  \ and joking, drinking and enjoying every moment. I took in what life meant to the\
  \ Italians. Its a life worth living. worth exploring, worth giving. Life is meant\
  \ to be lived, to be happy. \nIn Rome, love surrounds you. its beauty at its finest\
  \ both in structure and in people. Old brick-faced concrete structures, impossible\
  \ to imagine the glory of what they once were stood high. Walking across the bloodshed\
  \ of the colosseum, hearing the cheering of those engaged in the fights of the prisoners,\
  \ \"To the death!\" I swear you can hear echoing in between the fallen travertine.\
  \ walking through the catacombs wondering what it once looked like.\nIn Sisely we\
  \ explored the wineries and landscape, while becoming friends with Marco and Vito.\
  \ Being welcomed into there home, fed like queens and dancing til early morning.\
  \ the last thing I expected, was to find myself."
