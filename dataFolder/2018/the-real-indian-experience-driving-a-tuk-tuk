Text: "\u201CYou want a real Indian Experience?\u201D\n\nI momentarily hesitate. Then\
  \ cautiously say \u201Csure.\u201D My drawn out speech and the skepticism in my\
  \ voice betrays my wariness of his offer.\n\nMy tuk tuk driver pulls over, pats\
  \ the front seat and invites me to come up front with them. He assures me I\u2019\
  ll be safe. I throw my bag into the back and climb up front. We whisk back into\
  \ traffic, horn blaring. We weave in and out of cars, motorbikes, and other tuk\
  \ tuks. I\u2019m tense. It is certainly an experience \u2013 like a real life Mario\
  \ cart game.\n\nHe tells me to relax and act like I should be there. Once I finally\
  \ relax he puts my hands on the handle bars and says \u201Cyou drive.\u201D I protest.\n\
  \nMe: \u201CI don\u2019t think that is a good idea.\u201D\nHim: \u201CIt\u2019s\
  \ OK. You look like Indian Woman in the dark. No problem.\u201D\n\nMind you I\u2019\
  m a pale white woman dressed in a Kurti and leggings. He is suggesting that because\
  \ it is dark, people will see my Kurti and assume I am an Indian National. Apparently,\
  \ he thinks no one will notice my pale skin, which is nearly luminescent in the\
  \ moonlight.\n\nI give him an incredulous look. He persists.\n\n\u201CReally, it\u2019\
  s Ok. In India licenses don\u2019t matter. If police stop us, you talk to them.\
  \ Tell them you have no license. It will be OK. No problem.\u201D\n\nI image what\
  \ that conversation would look like and run through my best impressions of a dumb\
  \ tourist. Can I really convince a cop I was dumb enough to think that this is even\
  \ remotely legal?\n\nAt this point a wave of reckless adventure washes over me.\
  \ I think \u201CWhy not?!  What is the worst that can happen?  I die in a tuk tuk\
  \ accident in the middle of India? At least I\u2019d die doing something I love\
  \ (traveling, not driving). Plus it\u2019d be a cool death story for my family to\
  \ tell.\u201D\n\nMy racing thoughts come to a close and with a huge grin I agree\
  \ to drive. He shows me where the accelerator on the handle bars is located and\
  \ how it works. He lets me take over but keeps his hands on the handle bars and\
  \ foot on the break, ready to take over in a moment\u2019s notice. It is exactly\
  \ like driving a 4-wheeler.  Not hard at all. I zoom along having the time of my\
  \ life.\n\nWhen we come up to stopped traffic or a round-about, I return control\
  \ to him. On the straight-aways I drive. It goes on like this until we are about\
  \ to turn onto the road my hotel is on. He has me resume my passenger status and\
  \ tells me I\u2019m a good tuk tuk driver but I go too slowly.\n\nI\u2019ll take\
  \ that as a compliment.\n\n*The driver\u2019s name has been intentionally left out\
  \ to protect his identity."
