Text: "New York is already inside my mind; it\u2019s been there since I was a child.\
  \ It represents progress, the future, success, and the freedom to be whoever you\
  \ want to be. Images of its skyline are ubiquitous. It is the ultimate destination,\
  \ a port, a haven, a world of possibilities. It flickers across our screens as a\
  \ backdrop to love stories, gangster movies, fashion shoots, on television, in magazines,\
  \ on billboards, and I see a glimpse of it nearly every day. I know the names of\
  \ the boroughs, the neighbourhoods, the parks. Arriving there for the first time\
  \ is a truly strange experience. It all seems oddly familiar, and yet unreal. The\
  \ subway stations, breathtaking buildings, the pretzel stalls, huge harbour views,\
  \ and surging crowds are no longer a film set, but reality.\nThere is something\
  \ so unique about New York that I\u2019ve never seen captured adequately, however,\
  \ and that is the people. Travelling there with our 3 children, under the chill\
  \ April sky in 2017, we thought we would explore museums, landmarks, eat hot dogs\
  \ and see the sights. We never expected the people of New York to welcome us as\
  \ their own. The many times we found ourselves lost in the labyrinthine tunnels\
  \ of the subway, kind, generous people gently pointed at our maps and guided us\
  \ to the right destination, recommending secret sights along the way, delighted\
  \ that we had crossed the Atlantic to see their city. Each one had a tale to tell\
  \ of their own arrival or their knowledge of Lower Manhattan, Staten Island, Central\
  \ Park. Every one of them apologised for the political situation (although we had\
  \ carefully never mentioned it). \u201CWe\u2019re so sorry about our President\u201D\
  , we heard, time and again. \u201CWe\u2019re so sorry, and we\u2019re sorry about\
  \ the Brexit. You\u2019re welcome here, and we\u2019re happy you\u2019ve come! We\u2019\
  ll get through all of this together.\u201D This from a young Chinese American woman,\
  \ and then a tall young African American student from Atlanta who\u2019d just moved\
  \ to NYC. Later, it was middle aged white women in hand knitted pink hats, sitting\
  \ on the train with their placards, then Latinas travelling to work. Each one paraphrased\
  \ the last. Near the Brooklyn Bridge, an older Jewish woman, smiling, clutching\
  \ a large bag of matzos for Passover, showed us the way, her New York vowels ringing\
  \ out, unforgettable: \u201CYou\u2019re such a beautiful family! Have a wonderful\
  \ time in New York!\u201D We followed her instructions, and did just that. Now,\
  \ it is the New Yorkers who are inside my heart, just as their city is inside my\
  \ mind."
