Text: My cousins and me were walking to the lake Huron that is close to my cousin's
  home. So we decided to see the sunset together on the beach, drinking beer and singing
  some songs that, today, I completely forgot. We took a seat in a good place, and
  started singing waiting for the show. It was a breezy day and the beach was very
  silent and deserted. Usually is very crowded, but for some reason that day seemed
  that we were alone on the lake. At a certain point we heard a noise coming from
  the bushes and the trees. I taught that it could be someone who was taking a walk,
  or someone who was taking out his dog as usual. But, from the bushes, came out a
  young and beautiful deer. It walked in our direction. We were paralized, scared
  and fascinated from what we're seeing. The deer kept walking and then stopped next
  to us, looking in sunset's direction. No one maked a move or said anything. We stayed
  in silence looking the sunset with our new friend. After the sun's gone the deer
  turned back, stared at us for a while, like he was saying "Goodbye guys, it was
  a pleasure" and then returned home, I guess. After that we realized that we didn't
  take a picture of that moment, but maybe is right, because sometimes you just have
  to live the moment and keep it in your mind forever.
