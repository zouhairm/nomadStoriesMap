Text: "Imagine taking a morning walk and being greeted with smiles so wide you can\u2019\
  t help but smile in return, and repeatedly being greeted with the word \u201Cnamaste,\u201D\
  \ a divine salutation from their soul to yours.  This is what you will find in India.\
  \ \n\nA jewelry vendor smiles and invites you into his shop. He has traveled far\
  \ to run his small shop during the winter, seeing his family only for a few months\
  \ when he returns home during the monsoon season. The young man I met was fortunate\
  \ to be able to bring his wife and four year old daughter with him for this season.\
  \ \n\nI entered his small jewelry shop and we instantly became friends.  Although\
  \ his English was good, at times I would have to muster up my listening skills although\
  \ I loved listening to him speak. As our friendship grew over the next few days,\
  \ he invited me to his home for dinner. I was excited to meet his family and to\
  \ have the opportunity to experience their culture on a more personal level. \n\n\
  I arrived and was greeted with more smiles and even hugs.  Saying they live modestly\
  \ is an understatement. They resided in the back of an old cement building. Their\
  \ living quarters consisted of only one very small room consisting of a double bed,\
  \ a small table, a night stand and one dresser upon which sat a television. There\
  \ was a tiny kitchen area and an equally small bathroom. However, the space was\
  \ neat and clean.  His wife spread a blanket on the floor where we ate. There were\
  \ no utensils so they taught me how to curl my fingers appropriately so as to easily\
  \ scoop my meal.  There were no modern luxuries such as a stove or microwave.  His\
  \ wife explained that she begins each morning steaming rice in a rice cooker which\
  \ I saw sitting on a stand beside the bed. The three of them share the bed and dresser.\
  \ There was no air conditioner so the door to their home remained open and a fan\
  \ was turned on to move the warm air around. The meal was delicious but the graciousness\
  \ of this family, combined with the conversation and laughter, is not something\
  \ one can easily forget.  \n\nThe generosity of strangers as one travels this world\
  \ should not go unrecognized. The lesson I learned from this trip is that they had\
  \ so little yet they were so happy, whereas I have so much and always wish for more.\
  \  There was no closet filled with clothes, yet their clothing was clean and colorful.\
  \ They told me it was an honor for them to have me in their home. Little did they\
  \ know that the honor was all mine."
