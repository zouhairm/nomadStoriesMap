Text: "Timidly handing over 600 rupees, I said: \u201CNew Delhi Train Station, please\u201D\
  \ all the while frightened by the prospect of entering the 5 am darkness. With a\
  \ lioness heart, I was a young woman shouldering a pack full of dreams and limitations,\
  \ launching into her first solo travel mission.\nTaxi lights illumined the dusty\
  \ dew that blanketed the New Delhi train station. Burdened with a 70 liter pack,\
  \ I stumbled through an infinite patchwork of human bodies while scouring the station\
  \ for a phantom train ticket. I needed to get to Haridwar, where with another, I'd\
  \ carry on up to an ashram in the north. These plans soon fell flat. There were\
  \ no train tickets available. Just when all seamed lost, a legitimate looking taxi\
  \ driver offered to escort me to a government tourism office where, he assured,\
  \ there were special tickets for tourists.\nAs the sun emerged I found myself in\
  \ a dodgy\ntourism office. I was not only offered the space to examine India\u2019\
  s tender of exquisite sights, but also the nature of my current vulnerability. I\
  \ was filthy, exhausted and enduring the unmerciful taunts of womanhood while being\
  \ subjected to a relentless tour package checklist. A match ensued.\nHot chai upon\
  \ hot chai arrived, provided by a scam artist looking to soothe my woes and open\
  \ my pocketbook. In a city of boundless size, I was clueless to my whereabouts.\
  \ The final score was a heavy blow to the heart: half my monthly budget for a package\
  \ that held me up in dirty Delhi for the next 3 days.\nArriving at the hotel, I\
  \ was led to a room of objectionable quality. Entering, I gazed around at the gaudy\
  \ drapes, and taking in the moldy air, noted the pandemonium outside.\nSurrendering\
  \ into the protruding springs of a 1 star hotel mattress, a silent wail from inside\
  \ opened up, questioning everything I was doing. What and why I was doing this and\
  \ how do I escape it? With the cacophony of the streets piercing my reason, there\
  \ appeared only one solution\u2026 to sleep. \nOnes awakening comes perfectly timed,\
  \ and so does Mother India in all her mysterious ways. The phone rang at exactly\
  \ high noon to inform of my guide\u2019s arrival.  \n\u201CAll you need to do is\
  \ step outside\u201D my inner lioness encouraged. \nThe mighty force of human will\
  \ took over. I began to tear off the garments of fear and trepidation, exchanging\
  \ them for an armor of courage and confidence. I resolved to bravely leave my old\
  \ reality behind.\nMoving hopefully down the stairs and pushing open the door, I\
  \ went into the heart. I went into India."
