Text: "\u201CBeware of Johannesburg!\u201D they all said as I planned my tour of South\
  \ Africa. I cautiously approached the massive city as a travel hub. Coincidentally\
  \ my fever for adventure kicked in shortly after arriving. \nSoweto is one of the\
  \ largest townships in the Johannesburg area, the population is unknown but estimates\
  \ start around 1.2 million. Townships were originally created during apartheid segregation\
  \ but today are growing into sprawling communities, unregulated by the government.\
  \ \n\u201CTshepo, Tshepo!\u201D I heard being called out as we walked the clay streets\
  \ of Soweto. Our tour guide proved to be the life of the party. He laughed as he\
  \ handed out slices of his orange to locals as if they were tic-tacs. I was included\
  \ in the morning greetings, hands flying for high-fives and interested hellos as\
  \ we strolled. Tshepo would sing and everyone would join in. The energy was contagious\
  \ and I found myself dancing and clapping along to football team chants.\nThe first\
  \ neighborhood we walked through was urbanized, with well built single room homes.\
  \ As we journeyed deeper through Soweto the homes became closer and less developed.\
  \ It was as if I was walking through a city that had been hit by natural disasters.\
  \ I stumbled through a muddy maze of collapsing sheet metal shacks. \nA little girl\
  \ in a school uniform ran up and grabbed my hand. I crouched down to look her in\
  \ the eyes and she giggled running her fingers through my hair. She proudly showed\
  \ off her street excitedly pointing to her favorite features. And just like that\
  \ she was gone, running off skipping over a large stream trailing from a community\
  \ bathroom. \u201CIt\u2019s the government\u2019s responsibility to clean our public\
  \ facilities but since they don\u2019t all Soweto families take turns cleaning them\
  \ the best they can.\u201D Tshepo casually responded to the sewer stream.\nI left\
  \ feeling discombobulated and on sensory overload. I wasn\u2019t invited to Soweto,\
  \ yet I was treated as a welcomed guest. Spending a single day in Johannesburg is\
  \ unfortunate; there is so much to explore. Like all big cities there are crimes\
  \ that take place but assuming something bad is waiting for you in Johannesburg\
  \ will only limit your adventure. The last thing I expected was to fall in love\
  \ with this city\u2019s energy. The people of Joburg are what make it so special,\
  \ a true celebration of community.  I hope you plan a trip to Johannesburg and make\
  \ it a high priority destination. I am optimistic that your journey will be just\
  \ as unexpected as mine."
