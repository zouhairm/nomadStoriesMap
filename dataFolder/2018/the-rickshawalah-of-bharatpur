Text: "02 missed calls, it was Dharam. I looked at the time, it was 06.00 am. Had\
  \ I not told him to come at 7.00 am? It was my last day at Bharatpur so I called\
  \ back lazily and before I could ask anything the excited voice from the other end\
  \ informed the arrival of the first batch of Siberian cranes and pelicans for the\
  \ season and I had very good reasons to believe him.\nThe Bharatpur Bird Sanctuary\
  \ is one of the most famous places for bird watching and photography in the country\
  \ and having interest in both, one fine afternoon last winter I landed at Bharatpur.\
  \ It was my first day and only a few hours were left for sunset.  So instead of\
  \ going for a trained guide, I hired a rickshaw, a tricycle type cart suitable for\
  \ one or two persons. It was economical as it could be hired on an hourly basis\
  \ and I could not cover a 29 sq. km area on foot, carrying my heavy camera bag.\
  \ So there I was, entered the sanctuary on Dharam\u2019s rickshaw.\nAt least 10\
  \ different species of eagles recorded here, the latest being the greater spotted\
  \ eagle, he mentioned as he started to pull the rickshaw. Yah! Everyone knows this,\
  \ thanks to the internet! I nodded casually. Peddling carefully as to make minimal\
  \ noise, he was not only showing different birds but was also differentiating between\
  \ the birds of same species, which in my view was not easy even for many regular\
  \ birders, at least not for me! Suddenly he stopped the rickshaw without making\
  \ any noise, pointed towards a tree hole silently. It was a pair of owlets, together.\
  \ I pointed my camera but the light was bad as the sun was about to set. You can\
  \ get very good silhouette of birds a little ahead, he told. I didn\u2019t express\
  \ but was little humbled for sure! \nWhile dropping me back that evening he asked\
  \ about next day\u2019s plan and suggested to start around 7 AM if it was not foggy\
  \ and reminded me to pack the lunch from the hotel. There itself I decided to give\
  \ him another day; I would still have 2 full days if not satisfied with his services.\n\
  He was on time the next morning. Time spent together the day before helped in developing\
  \ a good understanding of each other. Over the next three days, he helped me to\
  \ locate around 50 different species of birds including Siberian Cranes. This can\u2019\
  t be better for a first time visitor. At no point, I felt the need of any other\
  \ guide even though at the end of each day he used to ask me the need for a trained\
  \ guide for the next day. Well, who needs a separate guide if a person like Dharam\
  \ was your companion!"
