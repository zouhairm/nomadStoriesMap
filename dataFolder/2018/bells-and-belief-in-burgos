Text: "Ding\u2026dong\u2026ding\u2026 bells are resounding through the streets of\
  \ Burgos, Spain. As I was navigating my way around this unfamiliar city, something\
  \ awakened inside me, and told me to follow what sounded to me, like ominous reverberations.\
  \ Against my original plan to ignore the intense draw, I arrived at the origin of\
  \ the clanging, a cathedral a few blocks away holding noon mass. Gazing up at the\
  \ spires and gothic architecture, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder how, in a city\
  \ where I had only spent a few hours, I had managed to end up here and why. Why\
  \ was the pull to this specific place so strong? What was the purpose of me obeying\
  \ the sounds coming from a church tower in a city where I was completely alone?\
  \ Why was the yearning to be in that cathedral taking over my mind when originally\
  \ all I could think about was how early was too early to order chocolate con churros.\n\
  \nI hesitated at the door. Would I be intruding on a sacred ritual? Would the Spanish\
  \ people see me as a rude American barging in to their hallowed space? I bowed my\
  \ head for some courage (and in hopes of not being noticed by the locals) and crept\
  \ to the back row of the church. The service was completely in Spanish, a language\
  \ in which I am not fluent, but felt as though I knew exactly what was being said.\
  \ As we all stood together to sing hymns of praise, and tears began to well up in\
  \ my eyes, I had the deepest understanding of community and belonging. Even though\
  \ I was an outsider to the people of Burgos and an outsider to the members of this\
  \ congregation, I was not an outsider to their beliefs nor to the Kingdom of God.\
  \ \n\nWe may not have spoken the same language, but we worshiped the same God.\n\
  \nAll the anxiety derived from my self-doubt was had been quelled. He wanted me\
  \ to experience Him in a way that I never had before. He wanted to remind me that\
  \ He is bigger than the frivolous concerns we humans use as excuses to not follow\
  \ him (or, in my case, to not follow the bells). At the conclusion of mass, we all\
  \ shuffled out the door and the people of Burgos smiled and nodded in my direction;\
  \ we all felt an unspoken profound connection with each other and with our Savior."
