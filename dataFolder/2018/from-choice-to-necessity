Text: "After my graduation, I decided to test my own nomadic skills and resilience.\
  \ It seemed strange at first, as I broke free of the daily rhythm I had grown accustom\
  \ to. And although I was breaking free of the daily rhythm, I had security in the\
  \ Internship I would start in September (with pay and travel). \n\nOriginally my\
  \ decision was not accepted lightly with family members as I turned down solid Environmental\
  \ Careers for the opportunity to travel to Uganda. For me, it was my biggest dream,\
  \ to them a nightmare. Regardless, after 4 months of traveling across Canada and\
  \ Tennessee, and catching up with family, I was ready to start my Internship Training\
  \ for what would be one of the most rewarding and devastating experiences of my\
  \ life. \n\nMy stay in Uganda was riddled with challenges, as the organization I\
  \ traveled to report on dealt with rape victims (from the international community),\
  \ murders (of past children in the program) and a premature birth that left a mother\
  \ (and fellow staff) without her child. All among the daily chaos of negotiating\
  \ with street connected children.\n\nI became distant, focusing on work and building\
  \ connections in the community, which eventually lead to cross cultural challenges\
  \ in both the NGO-Christian Culture and Ugandan Culture. I would later loose my\
  \ job due to breached policies associated with dating someone in Uganda who was\
  \ in no way related to the organization. With the organizations piling concerns\
  \ for my safety and the stressful conditions within the organization, untold expectations\
  \ worked their way to the surface as I fell through the cracks culturally, all the\
  \ while praised for the quality of my research. \n\nI had expected things to go\
  \ a lot smoother, but I am glad it didn't. If it wasn't for the pain and anxiety,\
  \ I wouldn't have learned what I know now. No, I didn't expect to fail at my first\
  \ job out of university, or to find myself stranded, jobless with no money upon\
  \ my arrival back in Canada, or that nomadism would become a necessity and not a\
  \ choice. But of most value are the connections and inspiration I receive from BOTH\
  \ private and company connections individuals I met in Uganda. Some of the very\
  \ connections I lost my job over are the ones who have supported and inspired me\
  \ to press forward. \n\nNow lost in the place I once called home, I am filled with\
  \ more curiosity for what lays beyond these boarders. I don't want to fear the unknown\
  \ but to take the chance to discover, learn and inspire despite the dangers ahead."
