Text: "\u201CMichelle Obama cooked Red Snapper for you,\u201D said Mr Ban. \u201C\
  There\u2019s chicken soup and rice too, sister. Fill up.\u201D\n\nMr Ban\u2019s\
  \ mother sat proudly cross legged, ready to present Khmer delicacies to her foreign\
  \ visitors. She smiled - she did have a look of the First Lady. I wondered what\
  \ her real name was. \n\nThe sun was setting, blanketing the Angkor provinces in\
  \ gentle darkness. In the distance, the outline of buildings and pylons on Siem\
  \ Reap's Pub Street slowly disappeared. All that was left was the soft glow of lamplight\
  \ over our dinner party.\n\nAs family members shuffled along the bamboo platform\
  \ in the front yard of Mr Ban\u2019s home, the creaking of the canes started to\
  \ make me anxious. I glanced nervously through the gaps to the mud below. It had\
  \ already taken me ages to dry these trousers.\n\nA plump, whole fish made its way\
  \ onto the wicker mat in front of me, my eyes widening. The children began to fight.\
  \ The bamboo bounced; Michelle Obama\u2019s eyes flickered irritably between them.\
  \ Mr Ban\u2019s heavily pregnant wife scolded them at lightening speed \u2013 she\
  \ had picked up on the signal.\n\n\"N'yam! Eat!\"\n\nWe began. I dipped an ornate\
  \ spoon into the pot of watery soup, the warm, aromatic vapour hitting my cheeks.\
  \ Steaming hot spices filled the air. \n\nSurprisingly, my spoon hit something hard\
  \ - an unexpected chicken's foot. I tried to ignore my shock, internally chastising\
  \ myself. It floated in the pot, awkwardly.\n\n\"So,\u201D a fellow European visitor\
  \ whispered, \u201Chave you heard the story of Mr Ban's life?\" \n\nI had not. But\
  \ I had an idea. \n\nMr Ban was of an age to remember the traumatic history here.\
  \ The words Khmer Rouge were only ever said reluctantly, and in reference to the\
  \ destruction of ancient ruins.\n\nHis father was missing from mealtimes; his mother\
  \ treated like a precious jewel. We had seen the killing fields back in Phnom Penh.\
  \ I needn\u2019t ask any more.\n\n\u201CYes,\u201D I said politely, \u201CI know\
  \ the story.\u201D\n\nBesides, Mr Ban had told us many tales of his life. He had\
  \ travelled the world, and trained as a monk. He revelled in the ancient world of\
  \ temples and Angkor. His bright spirit didn\u2019t allow time for dwelling on the\
  \ more recent past.\n\nSuddenly, Mr Ban jumped up excitedly and switched off the\
  \ lights. We were plunged into bemusing darkness. His finger pointed over my shoulder\n\
  and straight ahead.\n\n\u201CFireflies, sister! Look at the fireflies!\u201D\n\n\
  His teeth gleamed in the moonlight. I looked at my new Cambodian family, my heart\
  \ full. A content silence fell over us as we watched the show."
