Text: "Ten pairs of eyes stare at us from the floor. These eyes belong to ten smiling\
  \ children who sit in awe of the two foreigners who will be staying with them for\
  \ the next five days. Angela, the grandmother to these children, stands in the kitchen\
  \ just outside our bedroom door. Her kitchen feeds the entire family; every morning\
  \ she makes 2 and a half pounds of corn tortillas. She sends her grandson to buy\
  \ chicken from the neighbor and her husband, the chief of the village, gets fish\
  \ from the mangrove waters that surround the town. Her granddaughters are beautiful\
  \ and full of curiosity, while her grandsons are mischievous and full of energy.\
  \ I tell her at breakfast that today is my friend\u2019s birthday. \nAn hour later\
  \ I am sitting on the back of a motorcycle with 3 cakes staked precariously on my\
  \ lap. I can feel the coolness seeping through the boxes as beads of sweat form\
  \ on my upper lip. Angela\u2019s son is driving and a pink pig pi\xF1ata hangs from\
  \ the handlebars. People in local shops that line the street stop and stare. I burst\
  \ into laughter several times and wave to the cows being herded along the road,\
  \ their muddy odor mixes with the sweet aroma of icing and fruit wafting from my\
  \ lap. \n5 hours later the birthday celebrations at Angela\u2019s begin. We all\
  \ laugh and drink and despite the language barrier we feel connected. All 10 grandchildren\
  \ help me light the candles on the cakes and we begin the march back to the birthday\
  \ boy. Everyone joins in singing the most authentic Happy Birthday I have ever heard.\
  \ Our voices drift into the street and squeals of joy erupt when we realize the\
  \ candles will not blow out. They are magic candles that come back to life with\
  \ even brighter light after every blow. Finally, with the help of all the children,\
  \ the candles are out and the cake is ready to be cut. It is delicious, sweet and\
  \ cold, the perfect treat on a balmy evening. Icing lines everyone\u2019s mouths\
  \ and with a burst of energy the children blindfold the birthday boy and give him\
  \ a stick. He is lead into the yard to the pig pi\xF1ata. After each hit a few candies\
  \ fall to the ground and everyone rushes in to grab them. Finally Angela\u2019s\
  \ oldest grandson manages to decapitate Ms. Piggy and candy flies through the air.\
  \  Squeals of delight surround me and I realize this entire time a smile has not\
  \ left my face. I pocket this moment of pure joy so that one day when I need to\
  \ I can open up the feeling again and smile."
