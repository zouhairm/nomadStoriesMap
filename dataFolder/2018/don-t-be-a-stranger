Text: "Summer was fast approaching, the early stages of 2015 leaving me with no strings\
  \ attached to the place I had called home since I was 12 years old. I decided it\
  \ was time to hit the road and see what adventures I could find. After a couple\
  \ of months on the road, I found myself in Austin, Texas. My favorite cousin had\
  \ lived there for a couple of years now and I had yet to pay her a visit. The second\
  \ night I spent in that great city was my favorite night of the entire trip. The\
  \ famous Scoot Inn in downtown Austin was hosting a concert by the Wood and Wire\
  \ and The Whiskey Shivers. Unbeknownst to me, my cousin had friends there that would\
  \ invite us all back to their place for an after party. The host, Anna, brought\
  \ out her ukulele and was gracing us with her lovely singing voice. As a musician\
  \ and a lover of music, I was sure I had never heard anything more beautiful. The\
  \ night\u2019s pleasant surprises were not yet done when Anna\u2019s roommate looked\
  \ at me and stated \u201Cyou play guitar don\u2019t you?\u201D \u201CActually, I\
  \ do\u201D I replied. She went into the house and returned with a gorgeous guitar.\
  \ Anna and I would play for about an hour to the joy of the rest of the group there\
  \ that night. I remember later my cousin telling me she thought it was incredible\
  \ that we were able to blend our music together so seamlessly, having never met\
  \ each other before. I smiled and told her that music is a universal language that\
  \ makes such things not only easy but inevitable. I wrote in my journal about it\
  \ that Anna seemed to know every song I suggested we play together but I did not\
  \ know the ones she wanted to play. As I told my cousin, this wasn\u2019t an issue\
  \ in the slightest.\nIt was a magical night that I will never forget. Playing music\
  \ with a group who started out as strangers but turned into the companions of my\
  \ memory forever is one of the most incredible experiences I have ever had. The\
  \ smiles and the joy going around were infectious and it was easily the greatest\
  \ night of that entire trip. I would only be in Austin for about a month before\
  \ the money ran out and I had to return home but I will never forget the words Anna\
  \ said to me as we left. Unfortunately, we would not hang out with them again while\
  \ I was there and I am not sure if I\u2019ll ever see her again. But as we were\
  \ leaving she looked at me with a smile that was unforgettable and words that have\
  \ stuck with me and I imagine will forever: \u201Cdon\u2019t be a stranger\u201D\
