Text: "I had just arrived in LX (El-Shish), or Lisbon as most profanes call it. After\
  \ taking the 64 kg of my carefully packed personal belongings which included everything\
  \ an exchange student sacredly believes she will need for a six-month stay in a\
  \ completely unknown country, I went out to the waiting hall, where my tired eyes\
  \ were desperately seeking a friend of mine who had promised to pick me up and surprise,\
  \ surprise! Not only was she not there, she would not even take my calls nor reply\
  \ to any of my texts and emails. So, I had no choice left but to use the rest of\
  \ my battery life to look for a place where to spend the night.\n\nThat night I\
  \ found out two things: hotels in LX in late August are full and having strategic\
  \ connections or luck is crucial to survival. In fact, that night did not end up\
  \ being so terrible after all. You wonder why? I met Pawel, as he presented himself,\
  \ married with two kids, spoke eight languages at that time and was learning two\
  \ more. He was the driver of my last cab for the night and had a very kind heart.\
  \ He helped me put my \u201Ctiny\u201D suitcases in the car, listened to my miserable\
  \ story, after which he drove me to a place where I could spend the night without\
  \ spending a quarter of my budget for the month. On the way he managed to educate\
  \ me on the importance of Fado, Past\xE9is de Nata and Vinhos do Porto in the cultural\
  \ and gastronomic heritage of the country. He also gave me his number in case I\
  \ would need another ride while being in LX. \n\nI did call him in many occasions\
  \ and sometimes he would even come with his own car, when having a holiday or an\
  \ extremely sore throat. I can remember a time when I was going back to LX with\
  \ a late flight and I called Pawel to let him know I was coming. That flight ended\
  \ up being delayed by more than three hours and soon there I was yet again, in the\
  \ same waiting hall, late in the night, hoping to see a familiar face. He had promised\
  \ to wait, so truly happy I was to see him there indeed. He could barely speak because\
  \ of his pharyngitis, as he insisted sticking to the scientific term. I tried not\
  \ to make him talk, the only thing I did need to ask him though was where could\
  \ I put the bag from the passenger seat, to which Pawel said something with his\
  \ rough, husky voice I will never forget:\n\n\u201CMy wife suggested that you would\
  \ be hungry so I bought you something to eat for tonight, this is for you\u201C\
  .\n\nAfter hearing this, the person who was not able to speak was me."
