Text: "My Metro docks on a station and I get down on the platform. On reaching the\
  \ road below ,I gauge the local vehicles.Well, there are two lines of Public transports\
  \ and either we are supposed to go to the rickshaw puller-a vehicle driven by a\
  \ man or to the Electric Vehicle driver, but it  isn't happening in a sequence and\
  \ hence, there's a lot of chaos. I wave to 1 driver,he approaches me with his Electric\
  \ vehicle and I board his vehicle. As I traverse the dense roads due to evening\
  \ traffic ,we are met with a huge procession of The local \u201CGurudwara\u201D\
  , a religious temple of the famous Sikhs.They are carrying the holy book of their\
  \ religious sect on a moving podium and singing and chanting. As the procession\
  \ moves slowly, and there is a lot of time due to the un-moving traffic ,I strike\
  \ a conversation. It was 15 years ago, when Ravi came to Delhi from Begusarai ,Bihar\
  \ with his family, looking for a better and safe living. Bihar is one of the most\
  \ heavily terrorized State of India.\nRavi opened a tea-shop, here in a nearby plywood\
  \ market and used to work full time selling sweet tea to the locals, until 1 year\
  \ back when he got an Electric vehicle financed from the bank. He handed over the\
  \ Tea-shop to his father and started transporting plywood to nearby cities on weekends\
  \ and carrying passengers to and from the Metro station and around on Weekdays.\
  \ \nHe offers me the \u201CKadha-parshad\u201D a sweet delicacy handed to him by\
  \ a turbaned person in the procession. I bow and take a little from him. I tell\
  \ him that I am an Architect, he doesn\u2019t understand what that is ,as he is\
  \ not literate ,I then explain to him that I make layouts of houses & beautify them,he\
  \ smiles and tells me about Sonam, his 15 year old little sister , studying in a\
  \ school in Delhi.\nRavi has dreams to make his sister a literate person, unlike\
  \ himself. Back there in Bihar ,there was no dearth of backward people who would\
  \ never even let a girl go to school. But now, his sister is growing into a better\
  \ human being with education and absence of guns . This is all the more the reason\
  \ he says proudly for the fact that there has been no turning back for him to his\
  \ birth city. \nThe procession clears up and He drops me off to my destination.\n\
  As, I get down and walk to my hotel room I am more respectful of my parents and\
  \ thankful for the peace that I enjoyed each passing day, when I was growing."
