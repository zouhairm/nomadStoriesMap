Text: "\"\xDCsk\xFCdara gideriken ald\u0131da bir ya\u011Fmur\" I hum happily as I\
  \ find a seat on the observation deck. This old Ottoman song is still popular in\
  \ the Balkans and has even been performed by international jazz musicians.\nThe\
  \ Bosphorus Bridge now fades progressively and the skyline of Istanbul uncoils like\
  \ a violet ribbon underneath a soft orange sky while the vapur, steamboat in Turkish,\
  \ sails to the Princes archipelago. The five islands, known as Adalar, lie in the\
  \ Sea of Marmara two hours away from the European side of Istanbul. The air is cold,\
  \ yet invigorating and pure. The peaceful scenery has been enlivened by a flock\
  \ of seagulls chasing the vapur, shouldering their way to the mid-length of the\
  \ passenger cabin to fling themselves down onto the pieces of bread thrown at sea\
  \ by a skipper. The dim roar of the vessel's motor seems to give the tempo of this\
  \ early morning of April, contrasting with the swiftness of the seagulls in flight.\
  \ The passenger cabin is unbelievably packed with middle aged women and men, some\
  \ with their children, and some people in their mid-twenties. \n\"\xC7ay istermisiniz?\"\
  \ the grey-haired tea vendor asks. \"Yes, please\" I order politely. Drinking tea\
  \ is one of the simple pleasures of life in Turkey. As the man takes the last transparent\
  \ tulip shaped glass from his tray, he enquires \"Nerelesiniz?\"- where are you\
  \ from, without the prying or discriminatory tone one may find sometimes. I explain\
  \ briefly where I came from and return the question.\n\"I'm from Istanbul but my\
  \ family's roots are in Macedonia.\"\n\"So, are you an Orthodox?\" I ask cautiously.\n\
  He shakes his head negatively saying: \"just like most of the passengers on board\
  \ going to the Saint George monastery today, I'm a Muslim.\"\nIntrigued, I wondered\
  \ why Muslims would go to an orthodox monastery when in 1923 there has been an exchange\
  \ of population between the orthodox Christians in Turkey and the Muslims in Greece.\n\
  \"That's because we believe that on each 23rd April and 24th September, Saint George\
  \ grants the wish of the pilgrim who unwinds a spool of thread along the pine-wooded\
  \ path from the bottom of the hill up to the Church and then lights a candle. In\
  \ fact, amongst the thousands of pilgrims, almost three quarter of them is either\
  \ Sunnite, Alevi or Kurdish.\"\nAs I hand out 1.50 Turkish lira for the tea, I thank\
  \ the vendor with a grateful \"\xE7ok teshekk\xFCrler\", thinking how the Turkish\
  \ people are more open-minded than what the politics convey, and far from observing\
  \ a radical form of Islam."
