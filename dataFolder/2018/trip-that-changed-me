Text: "Travel was more rewarding in old days I remember when the tickets were piece\
  \ of paper that you guarded with your life & researching meant looking at travel\
  \ magazines & books in dusty places of libraries Advance Hotel bookings & Airline\
  \ Travel were a luxury that only Super Rich had access to It was much tougher, but\
  \ definitely more rewarding I am asked regularly by younger people to validate my\
  \ claim, & I happily do so I have always maintained that Travel has helped me grow\n\
  Most of my old friends will now not allow me to tell this story How I along with\
  \ my girl friend Heena planned a trip to Himachal Pradesh in North India, & just\
  \ took along friends whom we hardly ever met or had met just a month back for the\
  \ first time My promise to them was simple \u2013 We are going to enjoy, like we\
  \ have never enjoyed ever It is going to be a trip that will be the best of our\
  \ life Events followed\n\u2022 Getting just 3 reserved seats for 7 of us in a train\
  \ journey of 24 hours we enjoyed more than we had in our 24 years of life Be it\
  \ small fights in passengers or be it entertaining the entire coach with our jokes\
  \ & antics; every single minute is remembered by us till date\n\u2022 It was in\
  \ a small 4x4 ft cabin of the taxi driver association outside the station Obviously\
  \ we awarded our business to the driver who offered most number of places to us\
  \ in our ten day journey Chakkibank \u2013 Dalhousie \u2013 Khajjiar \u2013 Dharamsala\
  \ \u2013 Kulu \u2013 Manali \u2013 Chakkibank with stay at alternate places The\
  \ most memorable 10 days planned in \xBD an hour after reaching\n\u2022 Plan was\
  \ simple\no Reach the destination, Hunt the hotel, Bargain\no Check in & start the\
  \ sightseeing (have lunch on the way & not at place)\no Return after dinner time\n\
  o Check out in morning\n\u2022 Rohtang pass \u2013 Best day ever\no 7 people from\
  \ tropical country see snow for first time\no Ankles twisted, Skin burnt by cold\
  \ snow, Clothes wet & everyone happy\no Food tastes like heaven\n\u2022 3 hours\
  \ later \u2013 Worst day of trip Lesson learnt \u2013 never keep all eggs in one\
  \ basket\no All valuables lost or rather left in a bag at same eatery\no 2 cameras,\
  \ 3 wallets, 3 Mobiles (nokia)and, Tickets-gone\nThe biggest loss according to me\
  \ was that the loss of happiness & good moodI remember it took few hours of reassuring,\
  \ comforting, cheering, calming, consoling & finally laughing at this all Only we\
  \ stop ourselves from enjoying, nothing else does\nWhat I value the most is that\
  \ I restored the mood at the last point of journey, & that, by far is the last thing\
  \ I had expected that I can do"
