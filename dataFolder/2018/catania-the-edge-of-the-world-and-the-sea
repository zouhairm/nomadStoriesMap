Text: "I have always been attracted to the phrase \xBBliving on the edge\xAB. I wanted\
  \ to live that phrase. I wished to constantly be on the edge of my seat, anticipating.\
  \ And so I packed a backpack and took off, heading to a city standing on the edge\
  \ of the sea, on the edge of the world \u2013 Catania, Italy. The scorching heat\
  \ of august afternoon made my mind hazy and everything happening around me seemed\
  \ surreal. What served as a wake up call was an excited shout coming from one of\
  \ the passengers, serving as a proof of the easy-going nature of Italians \xBBMa\
  \ che bella la Sicilia!\xAB I couldn't agree more. Getting around the city proved\
  \ to be a challenge and I cursed myself for taking French instead of Italian in\
  \ high school. A few encounters with the locals made me realise English is just\
  \ not going to work, so I invented a m\xE9lange of French and the bit of Italian\
  \ I knew. It got me somewhere. Okay, I admit, body language and flailing arms came\
  \ in useful as well. The first thing I desperately needed was coffee, the search\
  \ for it didn't last long, taking the ran down pavement, I passed a few trattorias\
  \ and came to a quaint little caf\xE9 where several elderly Italian men animatedly\
  \ conversed and revelled in the feeling of the cigarette smoke entering their lungs.\
  \ Entering the caf\xE9 I already formed the hopefully Italian version of my order\
  \ \xBBcaf\xE9 da portare\xAB. I said it once. Twice. By the tenth, differently pronounced,\
  \ version of the phrase, I received the same looks of confusion. I was pretty sure\
  \ the phrase wasn't all that wrong. The eleventh time I realised it was my mind-set\
  \ that was wrong. I was in Italy. Rushing to drink your coffee is equal to committing\
  \ a deadly sin. So I took a seat and received a \xBBproper\xAB coffee. Next destination\
  \ was the edge of the world. It was black, enormous, threatening to spill all it\
  \ has been keeping inside for years and swallow everything surrounding it in lava.\
  \ Volcano Etna, the highest in Europe. Rightfully so it seemed. Climbing it took\
  \ me to another universe, to a place where there is nothing but black, black sand\
  \ looking like it will swallow you. And the edge of it was a hole, going right to\
  \ the core of this ball we inhabit, greedily swallowing everything that comes too\
  \ close. And just like people, sometimes when it got mad, it could do harm, swallow\
  \ whole cities. But at that time it was quite calm just like my heart when my eyes\
  \ set on the captivating view the monstrous mountain has to offer.\nSabina Halilovi\u0107"
