Text: "The second time I travelled out into the world, it was to Ileret, Kenya. As\
  \ an electrical engineering graduate and teaching assistant for the study abroad\
  \ class, my goal was to support the undergrad students in connecting with and making\
  \ an impact on the needs of the developing community in the area. Everyday I would\
  \ go into a large research facility by way of pick-up truck, following dirt roads\
  \ paved only by the tracks of cattle, goats, barefoot feet, and other large vehicles.I\
  \ would go out into the community to see shirtless young children with colorful\
  \ brands lining their heads whose bellies had bloated from a lack of food. The contrast\
  \ from my everyday life was polarizing and made me strive further to make a difference.\n\
  \nI had to blog the entire experience,the purpose was to represent the program for\
  \ families of participants and those who had invested in the program. When I landed,\
  \ I didn't expect to be a voice for a community. Not only my own and the students,\
  \ but for the Dassanech people who would never meet the decision makers who created\
  \ the program to make a difference or the alumni panel who work in technology and\
  \ would go on to support the program in the future. My blog would be the first place\
  \ where they discovered the commercials they see on Africa on TV doesn't represent\
  \ all Africans. And that despite the circumstances that some face there actually\
  \ is happiness in the communities! \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the connections we\
  \ made while we were there- the head nurse giving us hugs once we restored electricity\
  \ in her maternity ward clinic where they had been delivering babies by flashlight,\
  \ or the smiles and handshakes we received when we gave out ceramic bowls, plates,\
  \ bags of rice, sugar to families affected by a torrentuous flash flood in the local\
  \ area. Now when future students visit, they will have the lasting relationships\
  \ we built there lifting them up to gain support and assistance further into the\
  \ program- we were now the first voices for future generations of Americans in Kenya.\n\
  \nThrough my experience, I was able to be a starting point in the changing narrative\
  \ of a small part of the very large African continent. I was able to tell the story,\
  \ not of impoverished people needing help, but of a resourceful and persevering\
  \ community who with proper resources and collaboration are able to support families,\
  \ children, and culture together. I want to dedicate my life to making an impact\
  \ for people abroad and locally through these stories."
