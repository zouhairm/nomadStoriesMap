Text: "This is a rather short story about a journey from my native town in Palanga,\
  \ Lithuania to the golden coast of California in San Francisco. All because of my\
  \ primal hunger for written word since about I was 12 years old. An adventure from\
  \ the Baltic sea to the shores of Pacific ocean.\nSince then I knew my professional\
  \ life will somehow be directly related to Lithuanian language.  In 1997 in Vilnius\
  \ a professor asked me: \u201CKestutis, do you want to go to study in America?\u201D\
  \ No more than after half second the answer was resounding \u201CYes!\u201D At the\
  \ I was studying Lithuanian literature and language. September of the same year\
  \ I found myself at the university of Illinois at Chicago. I Spent three years here.\
  \ Afterwards three more years in Chicagoland, trying to build my family, life and\
  \ my language skills. It happened so that last two years until 2012 it I and my\
  \ then wife spent in Daly city and San Francisco. Unbeknownst to us we visited areas\
  \ later I found were lived a man who ignited final and lasting magic of a written\
  \ word for me supposedly mature person. City with Golden Gate, North Beach, Haight-Ashbury\
  \ intersection, highway 1, Monterey, and the majority of California itself. Now,\
  \ five and a half years later, I finished translating from English into Lithuanian\
  \ my third book, which will likely be published this year. I believe John Steinbeck\u2019\
  s East of Eden is a masterpiece of English literature. After reading it in 2013,\
  \ I decided it was an injustice people cannot enjoy it in Lithuanian. Three of our\
  \ neighboring countries as well as many in the rest of Europe had it translated\
  \ years ago. So I translated it for three years, immensely enjoying the process\
  \ of reapplying this human drama into one of the oldest living languages in the\
  \ world. As biblical narrative tells us there is time for everything, therefore\
  \ every individual, consciously or not, is trying to leave a lasting imprint in\
  \ human soul. John Steinbeck, fulfilled this his way \u2013 passion of storytelling\
  \ though his writing, which became his channel for sharing his ultimate pleasure\
  \ with the readers. I believe translator is a companion of the author, the role\
  \ I will enjoy for the rest of my life. \nWithout making this local connection I\
  \ would have never known the impact an English word by an American can have on me.\
  \ I would have never read these Walt Whitman words in the whole new light:\nThat\
  \ you are here\u2014that life exists and identity,\nThat the powerful play goes\
  \ on, and you may contribute a verse."
