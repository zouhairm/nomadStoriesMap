  \ a great nightlife, the Latvian capital of Riga has become one of Europe\u2019\
  s most popular cities for a pre-wedding rite of passage.  If that doesn\u2019t hold\
  \ much appeal to the intrepid traveller, neither do the hordes of holidaymakers\
  \ arriving every weekend on cruise ships touring the Baltics.  However, wander outside\
  \ of the city\u2019s main squares and something very different emerges.\n\nWe drove\
  \ west towards the coastal city of Liepaja.  En route, we stopped at Venta Rapid\
  \ \u2013 Europe\u2019s widest waterfall.  Don\u2019t go expecting to see the continent\u2019\
  s equivalent to Iguazu Falls though - the waterfall is less than 2m tall.  It\u2019\
  s possible to bathe in the cascades and, in spring and autumn, watch from the banks\
  \ as flying fish jump over the rapid to swim upstream.  \n \nLatvians had assured\
  \ us that Liepaja heaves with party-goers at weekends.  Unfortunately, we were there\
  \ midweek.  Latvia\u2019s third largest city has a seemingly endless beach, yet\
  \ away from the shoreline, other parts of the city feel neglected.  Just a few cobbled\
  \ streets further inland, several buildings are in disrepair and are a symptom of\
  \ a struggling economy.  The silence of the empty streets, coupled with the mix\
  \ of uninhabited wooden and brick buildings, felt reminiscent of the end of Leonardo\
  \ DiCaprio\u2019s world in Inception. \n \nI\u2019m not sure we ever did work Liepaja\
  \ out.  It\u2019s a curious place, made stranger by its northern suburb of Karosta.\
  \  The Soviets used this as a secret military base and while parts of it have remained\
  \ abandoned after the Russian army left in 1994, you can now visit the prison for\
  \ a tour.  Alternatively, you can stay and be treated like a convict in the part\
  \ of the prison which has been converted into a hotel.  If that\u2019s your thing.\
  \  \n \nIntrigued to see what else we could find near Karosta, we ventured to the\
  \ Northern Forts.  The imposing row of abandoned concrete bunkers were built in\
  \ the late 19th and early 20th century by Tsarist Russia.  The stark structures\
  \ form an interesting juxtaposition with the sea on one side, Latvian woodland on\
  \ the other and, in-between, a colossal wind turbine in the middle of a tiny car\
  \ park used by visitors to the forts.\n \nWe headed to the airport impressed and\
  \ bemused by Latvia\u2019s countryside.  If a man on a stag do had told us about\
  \ these places, we wouldn\u2019t have believed him."
