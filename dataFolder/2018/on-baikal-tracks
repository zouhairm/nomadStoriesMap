Text: "We rose before the sun that morning and set out along the tracks skirting the\
  \ shore - 30km by foot from Kultuk to the station where we\u2019d catch the train\
  \ to Port Baikal. Rail ties are not spaced to accommodate the average human\u2019\
  s gait, and the loose rock that formed their base was hell on the knees and ankles.\
  \ A sudden rumbling had us scatter to either side as a train thundered past. We\u2019\
  d have to keep our wits about us. \nEntering a small hamlet, we were greeted by\
  \ dogs, friendlier than a pair encountered earlier. One of them followed us out\
  \ and stayed with us the remaining 25km. We named her Siberia.\nWe passed through\
  \ tunnels short and long, past rocky cliffs, valleys filled with trees in the full\
  \ blaze of autumn colour, and an old Soviet engine house, the red star long since\
  \ blown away. It reminded me greatly of my own land and the rocky north shore of\
  \ Lake Superior, where the tracks of the CPR, like those upon which we now tread,\
  \ cut through the vast, unending Taiga. But for a different language, Siberia and\
  \ Northern Ontario differ little - both having seen hardship and exploitation, fuelling\
  \ the fortunes of a distant Metropol. Both retaining a rugged beauty.\nAt long last\
  \ we reached our destination, two hours early. Old carriages stood to the side of\
  \ the tracks, in the midst of being turned into lodgings. Two women emerged from\
  \ a building and asked in Russian about the dog. Understanding enough from context,\
  \ we shrugged and shook our heads. They looked at each other and smiled, providing\
  \ us with reassurance that we would not be blamed for dragging this dog many miles\
  \ from home. We asked after the train. No reassurance here. I understood enough:\
  \ \u201Cno train\u201D. No train! But how could that be? Then another word: \u201C\
  zaftra\u201D. The word sounded familiar. In my na\xEFve hopefulness and desire to\
  \ see the plan to fruition, I interpreted it to mean \u201Cin the afternoon\u201D\
  . We asked after food, and were invited in: Tea, Georgian salad, chicken, and potatoes.\
  \ During this repast Taimoor spoke up, and my heart sank: \u201Czaftra\u201D means\
  \ tomorrow. \nThe morale of my company now shot, we paid for our meal and stepped\
  \ outside. The dog Siberia was gone and, with this final blow, we donned our packs\
  \ and started back to Kultuk. The sun shone clear the entire way, and the lonely\
  \ morning march was broken now by happy families out for recreation. On the train\
  \ to Irkutsk that evening, we sat exhausted and silent. Behind us, a party of drunken\
  \ Russians sang. I smirked. \u201CZaftra\u201D means tomorrow."
