Text: "The feeling of numbness crept into my mind as I wedged myself onto a train\
  \ at Baker Street, tired from the journey from Hamburg and aghast at the translucent\
  \ black haze in the tunnel which the train had scattered as it burst through. I\
  \ hurtled through the city and wondered when I\u2019d feel that familiar rush of\
  \ love for it. It had been over two years since I\u2019d moved out of London and\
  \ I had delayed a return visit all this time, for fear that I\u2019d never want\
  \ to leave again. \nThe train spat me out at Canary Wharf, an area I\u2019d loved\
  \ passing through on hot summer days, squinting at the sun hitting the windows of\
  \ One Canada Square. By night I had frequently sat on a bench near the Cutty Sark\
  \ and stared obsessively at its skyline from across the Thames. That night I waited\
  \ to be impressed, but the twinkling blue-white Christmas lights laced through the\
  \ trees were outshined by the garish orange news bulletins snaking around the Reuters\
  \ building, just like on any other evening.\nIn the morning I walked to West India\
  \ Quay, depressed by the blandness of the buildings and the nine-to-fivers in monochrome\
  \ suits scuttling around in their shadows, wincing at the sight and sound of Gucci\
  \ stilettos scrubbing out half-lit cigarettes on the tarmac. \nOn the DLR, I used\
  \ to gaze across the rooftops of Shadwell, watching people hanging out fresh washing\
  \ on their balconies. This time I was repulsed by the pungent stench of marijuana\
  \ infiltrating the carriage. The dizzying heat and thick air generated by hundreds\
  \ of agitated, sweating bodies made my chest heavy. Disembarking the train, I felt\
  \ like the last smear of toothpaste being squeezed out of its tube, propelled forward\
  \ by swarms of people; they were everywhere, blindly scurrying through London\u2019\
  s underground labyrinthine network of tunnels like trapped rabbits.\nOxford Street\
  \ was the biggest surprise. I looked sadly at the stained buildings and meagre Christmas\
  \ decorations of a street I used to adore, missing Hamburg\u2019s M\xF6nckebergstrasse\
  \ and its wooden market stalls selling homemade liquorice, Gl\xFChwein and smoked\
  \ meats. I glanced at the black filth under my fingernails, up at the concrete fa\xE7\
  ade of Centre Point and down the damp streets blackened by car fumes and felt empty\
  \ and strange. Where was my love for this place, the city I\u2019d fought my way\
  \ into and left so reluctantly?\nI battled my way through King\u2019s Cross and\
  \ boarded my train to the Midlands, achieving closure from somewhere that had plagued\
  \ me for so long. I smiled."
