Text: "I spent the three hour drive to Amsterdam curled up in the backseat of Samir\u2019\
  s station wagon. Samir and Willis head-bobbed to rave music the entire way, impervious\
  \ to the effects of alcohol. The night before we\u2019d tested each other in an\
  \ alleyway of bars called the Impasse de la Fid\xE9lit\xE9, the smoke of travelers\
  \ and Brusselians alike breathing life into the street. \n\nSamir, a stocky, lightly\
  \ freckled stoner and thrill-seeker, had invited me on a road trip after finishing\
  \ culinary school. Riding along with us was his friend Willis, a preppy, heavy-set\
  \ 23-year-old British Freemason and freelance sailor. I feared I would not fit in,\
  \ but accepted, determined to embrace what lay ahead. \n\nArriving midday, we stocked\
  \ up on wine, bread, cheese, and hallucinogenic truffles before driving north. Parking\
  \ the car on a country road, we plotted our campsite on a patch of grass abutting\
  \ a valley of variegated mossy dunes. We raised a green tarp, holding it in place\
  \ with six ropes pegged into the ground. As the sun bled its red rays over the the\
  \ tallest dune, we unstuffed our sleeping bags onto a patchwork quilt and lit up\
  \ two bamboo tiki torches, our work complete. To celebrate, Willis distributed three\
  \ cow horns filled with red wine.\n\nThe following morning, we ground up the papillose\
  \ truffles into a maggoty mush, spreading them over avocado toast. After the quick\
  \ meal, we climbed over the tallest dune blocking our view of the sea, surprised\
  \ to find we were minutes away from a crowded beach. As we retreated inland at the\
  \ sight of so many people, the landscape melted into what resembled an oil canvas,\
  \ inviting further exploration. I picked up a piece of olive colored moss with my\
  \ hands and admired its fibrous texture, seasoned with grains of sand, then followed\
  \ Samir and Willis as they ran through the valley.\n\nWe eventually wandered back\
  \ to our campsite to rest underneath the tarp, taking our shirts off. I eyed Willis,\
  \ lying in a reclining position sipping wine from his horn, and imagined him as\
  \ lofty Roman patrician, indulging in decadence at the height of the Empire\u2014\
  I felt foolish and I loved it. \n\nHeading to the beach, we built sandcastles then\
  \ relaxed in the sand, watching the sky break over our heads. The cumulus clouds\
  \ assumed an elephant chain connected trunk to tail, haloed by the refulgence of\
  \ the late afternoon. Despite leading me to dabble in bohemian degeneracy, trusting\
  \ these boys taught me to follow my fears, no matter how crazy of places they take\
  \ me."
