Text: "I got up early that day and braved the walk through the locals\u2019 village\
  \ to watch sunrise on Koh Mook Island. On my way, in the morning dusk, all of a\
  \ sudden: loud barking.\nA horde of dogs appeared and started circulating around\
  \ me, nipping my legs. My heart was racing, trying to compete all the tiny molecules\
  \ of the adrenalin rush, triggered by the possible danger and intensity of the situation;\
  \ but at the same time it sank, having recognised my uninvited companions from the\
  \ day before on their prowl between the wobbly, palm tree shaded bamboo bungalows\u2019\
  \ trash bins, seeking for some food of a sort.\nThe young sprouts, peeping out of\
  \ coconut shells alongside the dusty, shell rubble filled path, formed question\
  \ marks for the burning question, whether they wanted to play, or food, or they\
  \ wanted me to be their food. \nI\u2019m often defined to be audacious, somewhat\
  \ reckless, for being the solivagant woman, I am. Well, these most certainly wouldn\u2019\
  t have been the words to depict me, were I seen stroking the crowns of my new frenemies,\
  \ with shaking hands, whispering some hodgepodge quaveringly. I wanted to turn back\
  \ but they didn\u2019t let me. \u2018If they want to tear me to pieces they will\
  \ anyway, so I might as well just carry on and then at least I can say that I tried\u2019\
  - I thought. So I started walking really slowly, with my shivery hands still floating\
  \ between ears, perky and floppy; muzzles, short and long; and my fingers running\
  \ through fur, black and white, beige and chocolate brown.\nAbruptly, I was strolling\
  \ through the rickety stilt huts of the fishing village, with bunches of fur bouncing\
  \ around me joyfully. Some of them got bored on the way and disappeared. But there\
  \ was this one family that guided me all the way to the beach. \nAnd when we arrived\
  \ they sat down. We were all alone on the endless white stretch of sand of the enchanting\
  \ Pearl Island\u2019s Sivalai Beach.\nI sat down.\nAnd I watched the reflection\
  \ of the dawn sky in the puddles, low tide had left behind; and I watched the outlines\
  \ of the innumerable islands emerging on the horizon mystically; and I watched the\
  \ crabs teasing the pups who were chasing them playfully before the former vanished\
  \ into their hiding places in the soggy sand; and I watched the battered, rusty\
  \ long tail boats; and I watched one of the pups nuzzling up to my legs to doze\
  \ off for a minute on my damp towel.\nAnd we all watched the first sunbeams of the\
  \ rising sun illuminating the sky above this little paradise, this unforgettable\
  \ moment."
