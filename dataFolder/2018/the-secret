Text: "I looked down at my sandalled feet. Grey with dust. Adorned with specks of\
  \ mud and other substances I probably didn\u2019t want to think about. \n\n\u201C\
  They come from all over to work here. From Rajasthan, down south, everywhere. They\
  \ can make up to 250 rupee a day.\u201D I heard Dhaval say in broken English. \n\
  \nThis was the real heart of Mumbai. A world held together by bamboo sticks and\
  \ dirty, blue tarpaulin. The slums. A world I thought would be full of desolation\
  \ and sunken eyes.\n\n\u201CLook inside here.\u201D Dhaval led me down a tight fitting\
  \ corridor between two dilapidated buildings. A huge array of smells immediately\
  \ assaulted me. The acrid stench of metals being melted, the aroma of surprisingly\
  \ delicious smelling food wafting through from food stalls, as well as the ever\
  \ present odour of a million unwashed human bodies. I peeked through a doorway.\
  \ Two men gossiped as they mixed metals in a dark, dingy room. The sweat patches\
  \ on their shirts were the size of dinner plates. One man opened the oven, hitting\
  \ me in the face with a sharp smelling jet of boiling hot air. 250 rupee a day worked\
  \ out to be a little under 5 dollars. They wore no shoes. No safety glasses.\n\n\
  \u201CThey could get safety equipment if they wanted.\u201D Dhaval said lightly.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhy don\u2019t they?\u201D I asked, truly aghast. \n\n\u201CThey don\u2019\
  t want it! You see how hot it is in there?\u201D He laughed loudly and beckoned\
  \ that I should follow him. \n\nWe squeezed through an endless labyrinth of tight\
  \ corridors. On each side, doors leading to tiny houses half the size of my bathroom.\
  \ Some empty, others filled with laughter and the sounds of life. Women sat in the\
  \ doorway nattering and giggling whilst they shelled peas or stitched brightly coloured\
  \ fabrics. Schoolgirls linked hands as they knowledgeably pushed past us. Some wearing\
  \ shoes. Some barefoot. \n\nAt the end of the seemingly perpetual maze we stepped\
  \ out into blinding sunlight. A small park. Brown dirt, of course. No trees or grass.\
  \ Nothing green. On the walls surrounding the \u201Cpark\u201D ladies hung their\
  \ washing. Bright sarees and complex, hand stitched tapestries were splayed across\
  \ the walls. A few little boys played cricket in the dirt with sticks. I smiled.\
  \ Classic India. Another child smiled at me whilst playing with what looked like\
  \ the end of a hosepipe. All that desperation and hopelessness I\u2019d expected.\
  \ There was none of that here. \n\n \u201CEveryone is so happy.\u201D I told Dhaval.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhen you have nothing. You have nothing to lose. May as well be smiling.\u201D\
  \ He said with a cheeky grin."
