Text: "The bus is three minutes late, but three minutes are basically nothing: no\
  \ water, no money, no air. They could perhaps be an icy shower, the rest carefully\
  \ counted by a myopic clerk, the lungs contracted by terror, or the chamomile's\
  \ infusion time. \nFInally the long-awaited bus-spouted voice stroked my ears, and\
  \ in the queue to reach the comforting warmth of the transport I watched his breathless\
  \ carcass like a dog exhausted by a run.\nI only had fifty cents left in the inside\
  \ pocket of my jacket, in addition to the handful of little change scattered in\
  \ the bowels of my baldric. Sometimes I hope to really have holes pockets, worn\
  \ down by time, with an escape for the coins that I place carefully inside. Instead\
  \ it seems that my pockets are perfectly intact, with a zip to avoid unwanted losses.\
  \ So I'm theorizing the hypothesis that a black hole has come to create inside them.\
  \ Having no contrary evidence, I continue to delude myself of its actual existence.\n\
  I always say it, we eat money and we quench our thirst with time, that's how the\
  \ great hungry and thirsty of the world are born, from the south of the globe I\
  \ mean. \nSomeone clap on the bus, the applause is the unknown factor in the equation\
  \ of success. You never know how many applauses you will receive, the goal is to\
  \ convince a quarter of the audience that you deserve it, then they will think of\
  \ the other three quarters. Inviting them to follow their example, and set the vibrating\
  \ air molecules in motion, bumping into each other, producing the sweet song of\
  \ admiration. Clap, clap, clap ...\nOh finally the broken voice said something interesting,\
  \ I go down at next stop, I have more or less 30 seconds to dress up, the zipper\
  \ will obviously never come up all at once, but will always met some obstacle on\
  \ its way to the neck. Scarf, soon soon, the triangle of d\xE9collet\xE9 uncovered\
  \ will come out in any case so don't do a drama, I will not fall ill because of\
  \ that epidermal fragment in the cold. The baldrik, taken. I have to book shit,\
  \ because there are never any buttons working near me I always have to press them\
  \ all, until the non-broken survivor will illuminate the \"booked stop\" sign. Now\
  \ I just have to approach nonchalantly at the exit door and wait for the braking,\
  \ respectfully clinging to the pole to the side of the stairs to avoid embarrassing\
  \ falls, finally the doors will open and after three steps, with the fourth step\
  \ I'll touch the ground.\nAnd goodbye bus."
