Text: "Overheated, tired and afraid to cross the road is how is felt on my first day\
  \ in Hanoi. It was by no means what I expected when I left my home for a six month\
  \ trip in Southeast Asia. For a while I actually thought about taking a flight back\
  \ home, but when the first culture shock was over I decided to make the most out\
  \ of my time here. A few days after my arrival in Vietnam I started teaching English\
  \ in a homestay. In this safe environment I slowly started to adjust to the Vietnamese\
  \ customs. With the start of a new course new students arrived. While I was trying\
  \ to make a connection with all of them I realised there was an immediate click\
  \ with on of the girls.\nThe next weeks we spend many hours together, in but mostly\
  \ outside of the classroom. She showed me around Hanoi and her hometown, we discussed\
  \ the differences between our cultures, she tried to teach me how to pronounce here\
  \ name correctly and how to eat with chopsticks both without result, we spent many\
  \ hours in our favourite coffee shop, ate fresh spring rolls and coconut ice cream,\
  \ got pampered at the salon, talked until late, but most important of all we became\
  \ best friends. \nUnfortunately all of this fun could not last forever. After three\
  \ months it was time for me to continue my journey. I had to leave the city that\
  \ I had started to love, but it broke my heart to leave behind my newly found friend.\
  \ The unexpected happened as it still feels as if a piece of me has stayed behind\
  \ when I left Vietnam\u2019s vibrant capital."
