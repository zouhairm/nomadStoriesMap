Text: "We 10 girls were working hard for today\u2019s trek as we would pass the famous\
  \ Tengboche Monastery where Hillary and Tenzing offered prayers & took blessings\
  \ from the High Lama while going to summit the Unknown in 1953 .We were excited\
  \ & thrilled.After a hard day's trek we reached our \u201CSherpa Hut\u201D for \
  \ lunch. But suddenly the place began to shake.We had nowhere to go as we were surrounded\
  \ by mountains on the banks of  the river Inja khola. It was sheer luck that rocks\
  \ and boulders from the surrounding didn\u2019t came trumbling down. In a matter\
  \ of seconds the huts were in rumbles. We all were numb, we returned to our hut\
  \ & had our lunch. One of us said \u201CEarthquake best serve with lunch\u201D.\
  \ We were about done when we got another shake. This time the Sherpa people were\
  \ really scared & they started praying to the Mountains Goddess.  It was a strong\
  \ one.  But Jamling gave us a green signal to proceed  towards our trek to Deboche.\
  \ \nWe were informed that the epicenter was in between Kathmandu & Pokran with a\
  \ 7.9 ritcher scale.\nAfter reaching  Tengboche Monastery we felt two aftershocks.\
  \ The upper parts of the Monastery were visibly damaged & was in a sorry state.\
  \ Our next stop was just 10 mins down the valley but it was cut short & because\
  \ of the calamity. \nToday we realized the significance of what Jamling told us\
  \ while we were boarding flight to Lukla . He said \u201CThrow away your itinerary\
  \ as nothing here happens by plan\u201D. I think the same goes for Life too.\nThe\
  \ next morning the weather was little clear & we could get some glimpses of the\
  \ snow clads mountains literally face to face with us. The mountains were so very\
  \ near to us & huge but we girls only thought of going to Everest Base Camp. Our\
  \ next stop was Dingboche, but no green signal came from Jamling. We got to know\
  \ that EBC is not going to happen.It is always as it is \"Only when the mountain\
  \ calls, you can go.\u201D\n\nWe 10 girls were selected in \u201CFulfil your Everest\
  \ Contest\u201D from all over India & our prize was a trek to the EBC with \u201C\
  The\u201D Jamling Tenzing Norgay. \n\nAll of us were broken down, but the best part\
  \ was that we were safe. EBC was not a dream for us literally, it came by chance\
  \ and the passion wouldn\u2019t have grown much if we would easily get in there.\
  \ But the earthquake made us realized otherwise. For me Mt E! was a dream.\n\nNo\
  \ doubt that we were equally sad as we will miss all of us but we shared a collective\
  \ dream and was a collective survivor of the natural disaster & we knew that \u201C\
  We will go back stronger\u201D."
