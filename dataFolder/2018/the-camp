Text: "The port of Piraeus is the busiest passenger port in the world. From here millions\
  \ of holiday makers depart on ferries each year to the iconic Greek islands. I am\
  \ heading to the Skaramagas refugee camp, less than a kilometre from the port. There\
  \ are over 70,000 refugees in Greece, most of them Syrians and Afghanis, but also\
  \ Kurds, Iraqis and Pakistanis.  Skaramagas camp houses about 2,000 refugees.  I\
  \ see no directions to the camp.  \n\nI arrive at an unmarked gate, 6 metres high.\
  \ Behind it stand Greek soldiers carrying machine guns. On either side of the gate\
  \ are solid concrete walls, two feet thick, the same height as the gate. The concrete\
  \ walls form the perimeter of the camp.  There is no other way in or out. On top\
  \ of the gate and walls is coiled barbed wire. The camp resembles a prison.\n\n\
  One of the soldiers inspects my accreditation through the gate, yawns, and waves\
  \ me through. The soldier returns to watching television.  \n\nOn the right side\
  \ of the camp is the accommodation.  It comprises an assortment of shipping containers,\
  \ tents and open air stoves.  Next to the toilets are 2 large dumpsters, one marked\
  \ \u201Crecycling\u201D. Both are overflowing. The smell makes me gag. The camp\
  \ resembles a garbage tip.  \n\nMakeshift clotheslines are everywhere. My eye catches\
  \ an Afghani woman platting a young girl\u2019s hair. Around 30 children are playing\
  \ soccer. A ball has been fashioned from rags.  Despite the stifling heat and bitumen\
  \ surface, all the children play in bare feet.  \n\nI am approached by a man who\
  \ says his name is Samir. His English is poor.  He tells me he was a dentist in\
  \ Syria, running a successful clinic and that he owned a large house. His 3 children\
  \ wanted for nothing. Samir\u2019s parents, 3 brothers and 2 sisters were all murdered\
  \ in the civil war. Samir tells me that he paid smugglers to take his family to\
  \ Germany, but they were abandoned on the Greek island of Samos. \n\nHe notices\
  \ that I have an SLR Nikon camera and asks to see it. I show it to him, but only\
  \ reluctantly let go of the strap.\n\nOn my return to my hotel I open my backpack.\
  \ My camera is gone.  I have left it in the camp.  \u201CAt least I hope he gets\
  \ a good price for it\u201D I think.\n\nThe next day I return to the camp. I recognise\
  \ Samir, walking towards me.  Samir gives me a broad smile.  He is holding a package\
  \ in a plastic bag.   He bows to me and hands me the package.  I unfurl it.  It\
  \ is my camera.   \n\nI stare at it. Then I weep. But they are not tears of joy.\
  \ They are tears of shame."
