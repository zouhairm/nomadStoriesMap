Text: "Since when we were kids, we often ask for things we desired. Yet everything\
  \ has a price. I had the opportunity to visit Barcelona during the independence\
  \ referendum, and what I have learnt from the Catalan was no matter how much does\
  \ it cost, they were ready for the price.\n\nIn the afternoon on 30th September,\
  \ right on the La Rambla, a car parade just happened in front of me. Drivers honked\
  \ their horns with the flag of Catalonia flapping along and the pedestrians echo\
  \ with it. A woman was handing out leaflets stating the current situation of Catalonia\
  \ and the upcoming independence referendum. They want freedom. They want preservation\
  \ of their culture. They want approval of their identity.\n\nThe enthusiasm in her\
  \ eyes made me stop by and kept listening to her. She expressed how she desperately\
  \ want the culture of Catalonia to be inherited. And in return I let her know the\
  \ situation in my home town, Hong Kong. We, the Hongkongese, are also trying to\
  \ fight for our freedom and protect our own culture. Suddenly we had that sync.\
  \ The sense that we understand each other, I could see the sparks in her eyes and\
  \ so did she.\n\nPassing by the Pla\xE7a de Catalunya, reporters were having live\
  \ broadcast and people were occasionally shouting slogans. I approached a guy who\
  \ was holding a poster and started talking to him. He helped to translate what the\
  \ people from that big screen said. When the president said the referendum is illegal\
  \ and it is just a farce staged by Catalonia, the public was outraged. And when\
  \ a councillor of Catalonia spoke, the public kept nodding their heads and clapping\
  \ their hands. Even if I am not a Catalan, I felt the same way as they do, their\
  \ strong sense of identity and high pursuit of freedom tugged at my heartstrings.\
  \ At the end we both kept our finger crossed for our place and give support to each\
  \ other.\n\nI do not know what would the future of Catalonia be like, but I am sure\
  \ that the efforts of Catalans will not be wasted. Even when I went back to Hong\
  \ Kong, I will never forget how united their people are, and how I should work hard\
  \ in Hong Kong to preserve my own culture. Best wishes to Catalonia, and best wishes\
  \ to Hong Kong."
