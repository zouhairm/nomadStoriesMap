Text: "It had been 9 months since the last holiday. Burn-out levels were fast approaching,\
  \ and immediate action was necessary to avoid catching the dreaded \u2018workaholic\u2019\
  \ disease.\n\nIt had been 3 years since my first and last road trip and my heart\
  \ was set on another one. I decided on the princely state of Rajasthan to visit\
  \ the famed Ranthambore National Park and catch my first tiger sighting. And thus\
  \ a 3336 km odd road trip was planned around it. \n\nMy first stop would be Udaipur,\
  \ a.k.a. the Venice of the East. From there, I\u2019d drive to Jaisalmer, the \u2018\
  Golden City\u2019. Famous for its living fort, one that houses homes and shopping\
  \ streets. Next stop was Jodhpur, the \u2018Blue City\u2019, primarily meant to\
  \ be a stop-over destination. And at last, it was time to head to the jungle. The\
  \ nearly 500 km journey would have to be covered in good time, so as to make it\
  \ for the evening safari. A final safari on the following day, before heading to\
  \ capital city Jaipur. And then, back towards Udaipur and eventually home.\n\nI\
  \ was all set for my overdue holiday. As the clock hit 6AM, I began my 750km odd\
  \ journey. Keeping ahead of the pace in the first few hours would help not driving\
  \ in the dark. To help me stay on course, I had the company of Mark Knopfler, James\
  \ Hetfield, David Gilmour and more. After 220 kms odd, I made my first stop. A hit\
  \ of caffeine and I was back on the road. \n \nBut in a moment, everything changed.\
  \ A combination of braking hard, swerving, spinning and then a crash against the\
  \ divider left me in the ditch. My worst fears had come true. I expected that the\
  \ holiday may not be as enjoyable as I hoped. I expected that driving for 3000 odd\
  \ kms would be harder than I thought. I expected that I may not catch a tiger sighting.\
  \ But the last thing I expected was my holiday to come to a crashing end in less\
  \ than 6 hours since it began. \n\nAs I waited for a tow truck to arrive, I began\
  \ to contemplate the day\u2019s events. Every cloud has a silver lining and I realised\
  \ that I needed to appreciate life. But I didn\u2019t feel the same or magically\
  \ develop a new found respect for life. Instead, I wasn\u2019t able to fathom that\
  \ the holiday was now a pipe dream. As the tow truck arrived, I realised my phone\
  \ was lost under the seats. I retrieved it and took my place in the truck. For some\
  \ strange reason, I had an urge to check what song was playing at the moment my\
  \ day changed. Looking at my phone, I broke into a smile for the first time in 2\
  \ hours. The song? Pink Floyd - Coming Back To Life."
