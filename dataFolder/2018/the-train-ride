Text: "Cape Town train station was buzzing with students running to catch a train\
  \ that was departing within a minute. Locals were rushing to work bumping on Thandie\
  \ like she was the \u2018caution, it\u2019s wet\u2019 sign the cleaning lady put\
  \ while she mopped the floor. Like construction workers laying bricks on wet cement\
  \ the citizens callously left imprints on the white tiled wet floor.\nThandie passed\
  \ the check ticket area continuing blending in the crowds rushing to catch her train\
  \ to Simon\u2019s Town. This was her first time in South Africa and she wanted to\
  \ experience the vibrancy the locals of the Western Cape Province appeared to take\
  \ for granted. The train departed at its assigned time. Thandie excitedly sat by\
  \ a window sit in first class while looking at the fading sight of the Table Mountain.\
  \  \nThe air was crispy with the Indian Ocean\u2019s salty breeze. Passing the beautiful\
  \ mismatched in painting small hut-like houses by Muizenberg Beach was as refreshing\
  \ as the air. Thandie got off in St James station, walking to the St James Tidal\
  \ pool that was wavy with children and parents playing in the water. The atmosphere\
  \ reminded her of home, rich with family and friendliness. It made her feel like\
  \ the locals that were sunbathing by the shore. \nWalking back to the short 5 minutes\
  \ trip to the station, to catch a train to the next stop was uneventful. The sun\
  \ was scorching at 32 degrees and she regretted not putting on sunscreen. The next\
  \ station was to the hippy town of Kalk Bay. She took a stroll from the station\
  \ to the main road getting in Ice caf\xE9 a beloved by the locals. Getting her-self\
  \ a vanilla ice made out of natural ingredients that the caf\xE9 is infamous for\
  \ was a relief from the heat.    \nWalking on the main road Thandie observed her\
  \ surroundings passing by folks who were wearing shorts showing hairy legs with\
  \ and vests hiding their pot bellies. She crossed the street saw a sign \u2018global\
  \ beads\u2019 all types of beading was presented at an affordable.  She was in heaven,\
  \ literally. Time was lost through the thrill of networking with the local life.\
  \  \nBy the time she got back to the train station the sunset was running away from\
  \ her, leaving behind the depressing fragments of light through the darkness. Getting\
  \ to Simon\u2019s Town was fairly swift. The naval base was covered by the softness\
  \ of the night; the inviting smells of food were a welcomed offense by Thandie.\
  \ As she sat at the restaurant enjoying her fish and chips she realised she never\
  \ took pictures, she felt herself blind"
