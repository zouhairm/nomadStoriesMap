Text: "\u201CWonderful, isn't it?\"\nI was lying on a towel in front of the sea. The\
  \ sand wasn't so hot since the morning was just beginning. The little girl - who\
  \ apparently came out of nowhere - was talking to me, smiling like the sun, which\
  \ was then hiding in the trees behind of us.\n\"Yes, it is\" I said\n\"Yeah. Later\
  \ on daddy and Kal are gonna get some fish for lunch. It's delicious.\" She laughed.\
  \ \"We can get you some. Would you like some?\"\nI stood up a little and, getting\
  \ some sand spots off my forehead, I tried to explain to her what could've happened\
  \ if I said yes and her daddy refused.\n\"He came up with the idea.\" She clarified,\
  \ pointing the small hut behind her, fifty meters away. In the entrance, there was\
  \ a middle-aged chubby man, smiling and saluting.\n\"He said you would like it.\
  \ He likes it and I love it.\" I noticed certain enthusiasm in her voice. How couldn't\
  \ I say no to those eyes?\nHowever, she clearly didn't know (or maybe just forgot\
  \ to mention that) by wanting fish, her dad had sent her to ask me if I wanted to\
  \ go and get them. Yeap. To go fishing.\nIt\u2019s much different to be on a boat\
  \ to fish. The movement is more violent because of the effort You must make to get\
  \ the web on the ship. \nI was defeated uncountable times. I don't understand why\
  \ mister Ayala would be so patient with a young foreign stranger. Perhaps because\
  \ I was funny enough to keep him entertained.\n\"Don't pull so hard. Fish know their\
  \ stuff. They know how to fight\" he said.\nI gave up after I almost fell off the\
  \ boat. Mr. Ayala laughed and palmed my shoulder twice. He took the web and released\
  \ it from the water, making it look the easiest activity on earth.\nAfter repeating\
  \ it five times, his son sailed the boat full of fish to the shore. The little and\
  \ hungry Pim (Mr. Ayala\u2019s daughter) was hopping on the sand, making circles.\n\
  We arrived and, after opening their chests with a knife and cook them, we ate like\
  \ kings (and little queens) on the wood table of their modest house, in front of\
  \ the sunset.\nThe sky color was an epic battle between blue and orange, the water\
  \ dressed a turquoise color and the son was parting after a fun day.\n\u201CI want\
  \ to be a fisherwoman.\u201D Pim intervened. Mr. Ayala said if there was a way of\
  \ extract energy from his daughter, she would light up the world with just a little.\n\
  \u201CHer mother was a foreign traveler. Just like you.\u201D he explained that\
  \ the people in the town had named her \u201Cfish girl\u201D for obvious reasons.\n\
  The following days I learned many things from that family."
