Text: "It started with a book. The type of solid hardback that\u2019s really impractical\
  \ to take on a two-week adventure. But I heard it was incredibly moving, and would\
  \ give me a whole new perspective on Sri Lanka. So in it went.\n\n'Tsunami Kids'\
  \ shaped my entire trip \u2013 and set the scene for an emotional local encounter.\
  \ You might say that a book about four kids orphaned in the sadness of the 2004\
  \ Boxing Day tsunami wouldn\u2019t be an uplifting holiday read. But it gave me\
  \ the most humble respect for the ocean. No day more so than the day I met Kamani.\
  \ We\u2019d treated ourselves to a taxi \u2013 a cool ride in the dry heat. Our\
  \ driver, Ranuga, drove us an hour down the coastal road to the tsunami photo gallery\
  \ outside Hikkaduwa. Sandwiched between rattling train tracks and a bustling road\
  \ of rickshaws, it was tiny; no bigger than a shed. \u2018The images here will render\
  \ you silent\u2019 said my guidebook, so I had to see it. \n\nThis little shrine\
  \ was facing the sea. The same water that caused the devastation I would read about.\
  \ It was a badly-lit room of tarpaulin and bare earth, with a corrugated iron roof\
  \ and the odd skinny chicken. The laminated photos on the walls had curled from\
  \ the sea air. Their scenes left me speechless. But it was meeting Kamani that I\u2019\
  ll remember always; when she told me her story \u2013 the unlaminated version. She\
  \ runs the gallery where her home once stood. \n\n40,000 were lost in the tsunami\
  \ in Sri Lanka.\n\nKamani worries every day that the water will return, yet stays\
  \ to share her story with the world. \u201CYou don\u2019t know tomorrow\u201D she\
  \ says. \u201CIt\u2019s important for me to make positives from sadness\u201D. I\
  \ cried the tears you cry when you can only sympathise, not empathise.\n\nWe shared\
  \ a hug. As I turned to leave her home I noticed a hand-drawn poster. It was a list\
  \ of numbers; rows of zeros. Kamani\u2019s donations to the local cancer hospital.\
  \ I felt a swell of gratitude towards this wonderful lady \u2013 sharing her gallery\
  \ income with those less fortunate. Bound by the ocean for her livelihood, yet living\
  \ in awe of it. \n\nI saw a lot of parallels with the book I\u2019d carried with\
  \ me that trip. The Forkan Brothers built an orphanage in their parents\u2019 memory\
  \ \u2013 building hope from sadness. And Kamani was the same. I wanted Kamani to\
  \ have my book and learn of others in the world making their wave of impact. Writing\
  \ a message inside I made Ranuga promise its safe delivery on his next trip. My\
  \ small gift to the lady giving so much to others.\n\nI\u2019ll never know if it\
  \ made it. I can only hope it did."
