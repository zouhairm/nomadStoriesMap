Text: "I got a seat next to the window. I always do whenever I can. This way nothing\
  \ escapes my eye: mosaic of the cities, scenery\u2026 This time it\u2019s different,\
  \ though. The window seat is my watch post: I will see if we are in danger. \nThe\
  \ bus is taking me to Ukraine, a gorgeous city called Kharkov I\u2019ve been dreaming\
  \ for years to explore. It\u2019s in the East of the country, far from the war,\
  \ and tourists are welcome there. The only challenge is crossing the border. Or\
  \ so I\u2019ve read. \nThough dirty glass I see streets of Russian cities, unanimous\
  \ in their sameness, with golden domes of churches standing out from all the grey.\
  \ In the country the color array explodes with blue, yellow, violet and endless\
  \ green. For miles I see no houses \u2013 just tranquil nature.\nThe boy next to\
  \ me wants to chat. He is pale and skinny and looks like he should be travelling\
  \ with a parent, although he says he is 20. Just two hours in I learn all about\
  \ his college, his friends, his big brother with whom he\u2019ll be spending the\
  \ summer. And I tell him about my Ukrainian roots, my long-time ambition to see\
  \ the city where my mom grew up and my constant postponing the trip. When the Russian-Ukrainian\
  \ conflict unfolded my tickets were booked and after hours of internet browsing\
  \ and talking on the phone with the distant relative who\u2019d be hosting me, I\
  \ decided to go.\nWhen I see the first tank I begin to doubt my decision. The tank\
  \ is big and khaki, hidden in the bushes on the Ukrainian side of the border. It\
  \ is surrounded by multiple customs officers who don\u2019t seem at all comfortable\
  \ with the Kalashnikovs hanging of their necks. Tension poisons the air raising\
  \ my agitation to an unknown before level. All the people in the bus feel the same\
  \ way and try to adjust to the new reality: what used to be a trip to your second\
  \ home feels now like breaking and entering.\nWhen an officer comes to collect our\
  \ passports we deliberately move slower than usual, our motions are smooth and elaborate,\
  \ no one even dares to stretch.  A few hours later they ask us to step off the bus.\
  \ Tired officials check my documents, question me relentlessly on the \u201Cpurpose\
  \ of my visit\u201D, and finally I step on the Ukrainian soil. But as I get on the\
  \ bus again I realize that the seat next to me is empty. My skinny boy alongside\
  \ with the all other Russian men younger 60 wasn\u2019t allowed in the country.\
  \ \nThe rest of the way I think of him and his brother. And when I look out the\
  \ window all I can see is the same blue and yellow and endless green."
