Text: "Though it might seem like an African saying, this is just the title I came\
  \ up with for a travel story that took place on the border between Tanzania and\
  \ Mozambique.\nWe had come down from Kenya and would ultimately have to reach Cape\
  \ Town always on land and public transportation. Having come down by the coast,\
  \ the closest bridge over the Rovuma River was hundreds of miles and days of trip\
  \ away, but we were presented with the alternative of crossing it by boat.\n\u201C\
  It won\u2019t hurt to take a look\u201D, we thought.\nIt is true that no one had\
  \ mentioned a \"ferry\" or a \"ship\", and, as such, we could not exactly claim\
  \ to have been misled, but what was presented to us was barely above a rusty canoe.\
  \ Moreover, it was as packed with local travellers \u2013 simultaneously amazed\
  \ yet indifferent to our presence \u2013 as one would expect from any means of transport\
  \ in these parts, resulting in almost the entire hull being underwater.\nWe reconsidered\
  \ our options, came back-and-forth and ultimately settled for an intuitive \u201C\
  Go\u201D.\nThe trip started smoothly and so it continued until we reached the other\
  \ side, much sooner than expected. It seemed too good to be true and in fact it\
  \ turned out that this was just a sandbank. There, we were kindly asked for a second\
  \ charge for the passage, the alternative being to wait for the tide to rise, which\
  \ proved to be a much faster though less cheerful decision for us.\nEveryone reboarded\
  \ and the boat departed again. Soon, rain began to pour (which did not make the\
  \ hull less underwater) and, as we reached the middle of the riverbed, the sail\
  \ became much shakier. Minutes later, our ready-made captains casually point to\
  \ hippopotamuses to the not so far left and, a few moments after, we spot crocodiles\
  \ closer to our right. \nThis is the time when one of my friends chooses to wonder\
  \ if we had made the right decision, to which I was only able to reply, juggling\
  \ rationality, fear and wishful-hoping: \u201CWell, it\u2019s not like we could\
  \ have stayed in Tanzania forever\u201D.\nIn the end, the boat hanged on fine, fellow\
  \ travellers had a good time smiling at our unease, the hippopotamuses simply yawned\
  \ from time to time and the crocodiles stayed to our backs strolling quietly. Or\
  \ we just got distracted by the open imposing landscape. \nThe rain also stopped\
  \ and the moment we reach ashore the sun came out dazzlingly. We unloaded our stuff\
  \ and marched triumphantly to the border post.\nAs Neil could have put it, it was\
  \ a small step of our trip but a giant leap for our limits."
