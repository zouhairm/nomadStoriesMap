Text: "I remember the day when I have to take  train for  Kerala ,my elder brother\
  \ came to drop me at station ,he  wishes me for safe journey .It\u2019s going to\
  \ be 48 hour journey .I never travelled 2 day journey from train yet. This was the\
  \ first time I was going out from my home state to other state to do my graduation.\n\
  One thing that I love in Indian train is people who are travelling. In one compartment\
  \ there is 8 sleeping berth, everyone around is with different idea, sometimes u\
  \ learn something or sometimes u have to face irritating family, but they are polite\
  \ they talk to u share food with you, you never feel alone.\n After long journey\
  \ I finally reach my destiny, I can\u2019t forget that evening when I take one step\
  \ on station it\u2019s been clean and less crowdie unlike any Bihar station. People\
  \ are chatting but I don\u2019t understand, it\u2019s because I don\u2019t know\
  \ their local language. I was standing on stair of station observing everything\
  \ the smell in the air which tell rain just stop, road was clean and wet it look\
  \ like a beautiful scenery with hilly wet road sun was dawning pleasant flow in\
  \ air make you feel comfortable even I\u2019m standing is state where I don\u2019\
  t familiar with anything. \n All the time I spend their, understanding their culture,\
  \ people, their language, is going to end in few year from now, my graduation is\
  \ going to complete in few year. In this year I make many trip I almost travel my\
  \ whole country but I never forget when I make my first trip with my friends. I\
  \ was in first year. We are planning a road trip (bike) of 200km, we are 16 people\
  \ but we don\u2019t 8 bikes so we borrow some bike from our seniors. \nBefore the\
  \ trip was going to started lots of things going inside my head, I was afraid, confuse,\
  \ it all goes away when I put my helmet and start my bike. One thing I told to myself\
  \ I can do it. It all goes well nothing happen except one of my friends had little\
  \ accident but we all return back safely, thanks to god.\nAll the bad and good thing\
  \ that I experience in these year that\u2019s makes me more confident and strong\
  \ and independent .I use to  remember the day when i was afraid of thinking travel\
  \ solo but today I can say I can travelled anywhere . I never know that taking decision\
  \ to do graduate from Kerala is so much great. Now this state feels like my own\
  \ home, unlike my first thinking Kerala as any foreign country.\nI can say that\
  \ deciding to do go Kerala for graduation is one my decision that can justify the\
  \ topic of this scholarship \u2018A decision that pushed me to the edge'"
