Text: "I miss the way he understood me. I love words, but sometimes they are unnecessary.\
  \ He was a middle-aged Indonesian tour driver. And I am, well, from the other side\
  \ of the world and another generation. \n\nWe would spend hours in the car without\
  \ talking and I would analyse his hands and the family ring that he constantly touched\
  \ as if checking if it was still there. He would slow down if he saw that I was\
  \ looking attentively at a rice field or a woman washing the pavement. He would\
  \ come running as a child, pointing at Mimosa pudica or a Tickle plant - a plant\
  \ that closes when you blow at it. \n\nHis name was Mario and he encompassed the\
  \ whole world.\n\nJava is not an easy island to travel in. Not only because of the\
  \ distances, but also because of its contrasts that are not always pleasant. It\
  \ can be momentarily rich in colours, especially green, but also dusty, brown and\
  \ lacking in landscape. You have ancient Hindu and Buddhist temples that withstood\
  \ centuries, but on the other side of the road you see houses that probably won\u2019\
  t withstand the next earthquake. The sweet smell of humidity in Sukuh temple that\
  \ stands on the slope of a mountain surrounded by rainforest is not quite the same\
  \ as the smell of the air in the ferry that goes from Java to Bali. \n\nMario showed\
  \ us his country without trying to hide the ugly sides and without praising the\
  \ beautiful ones. He didn\u2019t judge our reactions and didn\u2019t try to impact\
  \ our opinion. He showed it the way it is \u2013 stopping at a pineapple farm or\
  \ a side road where a monkey family was having breakfast, but also noticing how\
  \ uncomfortable I would get with all the attention, pleasant and not, and would\
  \ tell the guide that we should get going as it was getting late, when it really\
  \ wasn\u2019t. \n\nHe was the biggest revelation and the saddest goodbye. We all\
  \ cried. Strange, we hadn\u2019t said a word to each other this whole time. It seems\
  \ that language is so important when you travel, but I learnt so much more from\
  \ what Mario showed me than from what the guide told me. He was showing me HIS country\
  \ with such an incredible love for it that all I needed to understand it was to\
  \ use my senses \u2013 smell, touch and see. \n\nI imagine him, sitting next to\
  \ his car, drinking that really strong Kopi Luwak coffee and having his morning\
  \ cigarette, pointing out a flower to a disinterested tourist and it breaks my heart.\
  \ A small, child-like, inquisitive eyed Indonesian man understood me better than\
  \ I did. We don\u2019t deserve Marios."
