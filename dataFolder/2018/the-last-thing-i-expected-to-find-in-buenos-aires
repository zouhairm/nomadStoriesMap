Text: "I bent down in the dimly lit room to fasten on my newly purchased glittery\
  \ gold and black shoes. They fit so well, my feet looked like jewels. This trip\
  \ was turning out to be better than I imagined. I didn\u2019t know that the gentle\
  \ sound of Buscandote, the warmth of embraced dancers, the taste of Malbec on my\
  \ lips, and the flickering candles could soothe such a broken soul. Who knew after\
  \ 11 years, I would be sitting here in Buenos Aires on my own. My past life with\
  \ him as a fading memory each day. I wonder how many people have sat here with same\
  \ sinking in their hearts.  I was proud of myself for taking a trip alone, yet my\
  \ inside was still jumbled up in nerves. It was time to see if my 4 months of lessons\
  \ paid off.  I stood up on my new heels strongly to visit the ladies room.  I was\
  \ surrounded by local milongueras of all ages who must have danced for years with\
  \ eclectic outfits and great bodies. I wonder if they could tell how new I was by\
  \ my shoes. I put on a thin layer of red lipstick and barely recognized myself in\
  \ the mirror. I had transformed into a feminine, strong, confident lady on the outside\
  \ with doubt and uncertainty of who I was on the inside. I went back and found my\
  \ seat. He caught my eye across the room with a constant stare that invited me to\
  \ dance. I stood up as he led me to the floor. His arm generously wrapped around\
  \ my back all the way to my other shoulder. I embraced him as if I was hugging someone\
  \ I had known for years. We both took in a gentle breath as the song began. His\
  \ leg moved to step left and mine followed. He paused and I paused. He began to\
  \ walk and I followed. Any slight twitch of his hand and my body followed. As the\
  \ music grew with intensity, I felt the energy between us grow. My eyes closed,\
  \ the music flowing through my blood I began to no longer think but to move with\
  \ certainty all over the dance floor.  The enormity of my grieving melted and left\
  \ me feeling open. The energy between us and all of the generations of people that\
  \ had danced here over the years filled my body. I was elegant yet strong. People\
  \ watched from afar as our intense connection could be felt by those around. The\
  \ music ended and I lingered in his arms for a few more seconds. The embrace broke\
  \ and he returned me to my seat. That tanda danced led me to find something I hadn\u2019\
  t expected in Buenos Aires, I now knew who I was again at that moment in time. I\
  \ was able to return home as a solid woman inside and outside, ready to embrace\
  \ my future."
