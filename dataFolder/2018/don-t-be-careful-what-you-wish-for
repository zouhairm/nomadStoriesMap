Text: "I think I wished cancer upon myself. I understand that might sound weird to\
  \ you, but I think it is true. And let me tell you - it is the best thing that has\
  \ ever happened to me. I couldn't have done what I did without it.\n\n While I considered\
  \ myself to be a lot more adventurous than the people I grew up with, there was\
  \ always a certain excitement missing in my life. Yes, I moved out at 16 to escape\
  \ my parents' divorce. Yes, at the age of 20,  I left my tiny town in my home country\
  \ the Netherlands, to move to one of the biggest metropolitans in the world. \n\n\
  And yet, there I was, in Istanbul. After a few months of playing tour guide and\
  \ stuffing my face with baklava, the novelty of this great city wore off and I found\
  \ myself stuck in a rut again. Let me rephrase this: I found myself stuck in my\
  \ comfort zone.\n\nFour years passed by. Four years of trying to find my passion,\
  \ trying to find meaning. And in the end, my life didn't look much different than\
  \ the one I had back in the Netherlands. I cooked and I cleaned and I wrote and\
  \ I fed the dog and my boyfriend.\nI made friends and I partied and I shopped and\
  \ I painted and I washed and I cried.\n\nOn a cold October night, I found myself\
  \ in the gym, not much later in the ER.\nA few days later I was diagnosed with cancer.\
  \ This is where it all started.\n\nI had to move back to the Netherlands because\
  \ my Turkish insurance would not cover my surgeries. I had to leave my boyfriend,\
  \ dog, friends and life behind, and eight years after I last lived at home, I found\
  \ myself living at my father's with his new wife and their five-year old. \n\nMonths\
  \ passed, and after two surgeries, radiotherapy and the complete removal of an organ,\
  \ I was allowed to go back to Turkey. Every three months I flew back and forth for\
  \ my checkups and body scans. And six months later I got the great news that I was\
  \ 'clean'.\n\nMy boyfriend's company collapsed because of the political situation\
  \ in Turkey. So all of a sudden, we had no reason to stay in Istanbul anymore. Because\
  \ of what happened to us, we got a serious case of 'f*ck you mentality'. I gave\
  \ myself a few more months to get back on track, and exactly 15 months after my\
  \ diagnosis, we were on a one way flight to Bangkok.\n\nWe don't have an address\
  \ or a home. For over two years we have been roaming the globe and enjoying every\
  \ second of it. I still have bad days because I am not 100% healthy yet, but that's\
  \ ok. Finally every day is an adventure and that is why cancer is the best thing\
  \ that ever happened to me."
