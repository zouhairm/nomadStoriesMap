Text: "I didn\u2019t grow up with dogs, I was kind of scared them. It wasn\u2019t\
  \ until I was in my 30\u2019s, and my partner said he wanted a dog, that I even\
  \ entertained the idea. A puppy came from the local rescue shelter and that dog,\
  \ quickly became an integral part of my life, so much so, that I came to the conclusion\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t actually imagine life without a dog.\nNepal was always on\
  \ the itinerary, it was simply a matter of time. One of the girls I taught with\
  \ asked at a team meeting \u201CDoes anyone want to come to Nepal?\u201D It wasn\u2019\
  t on the agenda at that point in time, however, when the previously mentioned relationship\
  \ came to an abrupt end, my thoughts returned to that question\u2026 Does anyone\
  \ want to come to Nepal?\nI arrived in Kathmandu ahead of Joj, and had a day to\
  \ wander the streets of Thamel, the more touristy area of the city. Dusty narrow\
  \ alleys, food vendors, knitted items, souvenirs and outdoor equipment stores as\
  \ far as the eye could see.  Yet, I couldn\u2019t help but notice all the street\
  \ dogs wandering around. I knew street dogs were a little dodgy, dirty, possibly\
  \ diseased, not one to be tampered with. There was one in particular that caught\
  \ my eye, curled up asleep in the sun outside a shop door. Without thinking, I went\
  \ and put my hand on it\u2019s furry head and immediately burst into tears.\nA couple\
  \ of days later I was up early, I needed to get outside. Nothing was open, the sun\
  \ was up and the streets were quiet and empty, a far cry from the usual tourist\
  \ bustle. By this time, I had been away from home for about a week, and I missed\
  \ my pup. I needed to find the dog that had caught my eye. I walked the empty streets.\
  \ The shop fronts were all sheathed in corrugated metal, slightly rusty, pulled\
  \ down tight to avoid prying eyes or fingers. On the other side of a street, there\
  \ it lay, curled up in the early morning sun. \nI hesitated, knowing that, from\
  \ many stories I\u2019d read, one shouldn\u2019t touch street dogs, yet, I needed\
  \ to. I went over, sat on the concrete steps and put my hand on it\u2019s head.\
  \ Next thing I knew, all these other street dogs had come over, crowding around,\
  \ wanting In on the action, nosing their heads up under my hand. Honestly, I was\
  \ a little scared, I'd only wanted to touch that one, and suddenly, I had 4 or 5\
  \ street dogs, right up close, leaning in. All the local Nepalese men in the street\
  \ were laughing at me, and I didn\u2019t care. It made my morning. A connection\
  \ I did not expect, yet we are all the same world-wide. Simple connection and affection."
