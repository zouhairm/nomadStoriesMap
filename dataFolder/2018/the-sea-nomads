Text: "The Billabong Stilt House deck stretches several meters into the Celebes Sea\
  \ off the coast of Mabul Island, Malaysia, creating a spectacular space to view\
  \ the turquoise waters. The marine life beneath captivates me, from the chocolate\
  \ chip sea star to the turtle poking its head out.\n\nWith the optical zoom of my\
  \ camera, I decide to explore. Suddenly, I notice a few people on wooden canoes\
  \ trying to capture my attention. \n\n\u201CMoney, baby,\u201D says a young girl.\
  \ Accompanied by her sister, she holds a gondola-like rowing oar in one hand. With\
  \ the other hand, she moves her fingers to her mouth to signal hunger. \n\n\u201C\
  No money! Do you want food?\u201D I ask. \n\nShe smiles! \n\nOn another canoe, a\
  \ man picks up a large plastic bottle containing a foot-long mantis shrimp to sell.\
  \ I wonder how he got the shrimp into the bottle. I explain that I have no cooking\
  \ facility: the instantaneous change in his facial expression tells a heartfelt\
  \ story about his survival needs. \n\nI share some of my food with the man and the\
  \ girls, and watch them paddle away. Driven by curiosity, I zoom in with my camera\
  \ to learn more about the girls. \n\nThey row towards an anchored boat house, no\
  \ more than five meters long and two meters wide. The size of a tiny trailer. The\
  \ boat house is old and has a central structure, covered with colorful sheets to\
  \ keep the sunlight out.\n\nFour adults and four children seem to live on the boat\
  \ house. A child is playing on the roof with a piece of wood. A lady is cooking,\
  \ while two elders and a mid-aged man are sitting near with a baby. The girls attach\
  \ the canoe to the boat and give the food to the adults. I assume they are a family\
  \ and work together to sustain themselves.\n  \nThe girls are part of the Bajau\
  \ Laut community, also known as the Sea Nomads. \n\nThe Bajau Laut live around Malaysia,\
  \ Philippines and Indonesia on small boats. They are known for their free diving\
  \ skills and ability to catch sea life. They set foot on land only to sell their\
  \ catch, get fresh water and buy boat parts. Tourism has created another channel\
  \ of daily engagement and trade for them.\n \nThe Bajau Laut are stateless. They\
  \ are denied a nationality. The children grow up just as their parents did on the\
  \ sea. They lack access to healthcare, education and jobs. As a result, they will\
  \ face multiple challenges in their lifetime. \n\nThe Bajau Laut are ignored by\
  \ the East and the West. \n\nI realize how easy it is to be a blind tourist and\
  \ how much I take for granted."
