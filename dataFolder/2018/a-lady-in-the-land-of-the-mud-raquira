Text: "- There is nothing that a good red does not solve!\nThat said, Mrs. Gloria\
  \ Hern\xE1ndez, offered me a black coffee as hot as the heart of the residents of\
  \ R\xE1quira: a municipality framed in one of the most beautiful regions of Colombia\
  \ called Boyac\xE1, known for its beautiful crafts made of terracotta and whose\
  \ activity for decades has been transforming the landscape of the region.\nI arrived\
  \ on a Friday, accompanied only by my backpack and the flight of the swallows in\
  \ search of the Desert of the Candelaria, to spend a weekend among the old walls\
  \ of the Monastery that rises there, in the middle of this arid landscape so propitious\
  \ for the reflection. Since it was a very sunny day, I went to a store on one of\
  \ the sides of the square to buy something to drink and from the beginning there\
  \ was a kind conversation that Dona Gloria, the owner of the store. He gave me the\
  \ precise directions to get to my destination, and he also suggested other travel\
  \ options in the nearby municipality of Villa de Leyva. His 18-year-old son accompanied\
  \ me to the Monastery of the Augustinian Fathers, which is about an hour away: a\
  \ beautiful building built in 1597 that expanded over the centuries and has a great\
  \ story to tell the visitors, with a small museum inside and a cave of an ancient\
  \ monk located inside a nearby mountain in perfect condition, something not to miss!\n\
  You can not be in Boyac\xE1 without delighting in its exquisite cuisine, so back\
  \ in R\xE1quira we enjoyed a delicious aguadepanela (sugarcane tea) accompanied\
  \ by almoj\xE1bana, and cuajada with bocadillo (a sweet made from a Colombian fruit\
  \ called guavaba and with a cheese kind more soft). That night with the help of\
  \ a telescope and taking advantage of the clear sky we could observe a beautiful\
  \ starry sky, returning to the municipality to plan my return home.\nThe next day,\
  \ just before leaving, I accompanied Dona Gloria's family to the kilns where they\
  \ made the ceramics and other elements with the clay that is extracted from the\
  \ surroundings of the area, an art that should not be missed, where I received as\
  \ gift some crafts on behalf of the workers of the place. Definitely R\xE1quira\
  \ became in a short time, an unforgettable experience for its history, the variety\
  \ of its landscapes, its customs and the hearts of its people, especially the nice\
  \ family of Do\xF1a Gloria, without forgetting the possibility of understanding\
  \ better the culture of this part of the country, making this trip the best experience\
  \ with local people I've had so far."
