Text: "In my heart I had always been a sailor. Neither getting married, nor having\
  \ children changed that. A couple of months after the birth of our 2nd son we quit\
  \ our jobs, resigned our lease, sold everything and bought a one way ticket from\
  \ Sydney to Athens.\nWe first spent 6 months in a campervan, slithering along the\
  \ European coastline looking at hundreds of boats. After a cold, rainy winter in\
  \ the UK making some extra cash for the journey ahead, we moved aboard Happy Dancer,\
  \ a strong English yacht. \nOur first sail out of the tranquil bay of Kilada, Greece,\
  \ ended in a near disaster as 30 knots of wind almost destroyed our transom against\
  \ the quay of Ermioni. After a very tight save, my Patagonian man quickly learnt\
  \ the ropes, and myself the local mooring manoeuvres. Before we knew it, we were\
  \ comfortably cruising through the Corinth Canal, on an eerie midnight, with over\
  \ 40 knots shooting us through the Bay of Patras.\nFast forward a zillion and one\
  \ out-of-this world cruising destinations, unforgettable encounters, new friends\
  \ and 2 years living aboard as a family, we find ourselves bound Eastwards towards\
  \ the Atlantic. We had just spent a couple of days reunited with another cruising\
  \ family exploring Rhodes\u2019 ancient ruins and chose a no-breeze farewell day\
  \ for a supposedly easy rump line trip to the next island.\nThe engine pushing us\
  \ along at a steady 5 knots, with seemingly no necessity for extra caution, I left\
  \ hubby in charge in the cockpit and went to have a nap with the kids. A couple\
  \ of hours later I wake up. No sooner have I turned on the kettle, do I notice water\
  \ up to my ankles. This is not a feeling you expect to have in your galley. \nMy\
  \ eyes, which went from sleepy to 150% open in the split of a second, moved towards\
  \ where a reverse waterfall was coming out of the lifting floorboards. Pure survival\
  \ instinct got me to speed forward to press my hand on the failing thru-hull. We\
  \ managed to avert disaster by bucketing out the access water the bilge pump couldn\u2019\
  t keep up with and securing the adequate replacement plug triply. \nIt wasn\u2019\
  t until long after we had arrived in plentiful save ports to follow, that the terror\
  \ hit home of how quickly everything could have been swallowed up by the Sea. We\
  \ are currently on a sailing break back home. Yet as much as I know we needed this\
  \ after almost tipping over the edge, I also know that the ocean will be calling\
  \ us again before too long. This time with a bit more caution, slightly older kids\
  \ and more experience in tow."
