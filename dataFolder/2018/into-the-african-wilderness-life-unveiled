Text: "For me, travelling has always involved self-exploration as much as exploring\
  \ new scenery. As I move around the world and interact with others I learn what\
  \ is truly me and what is merely customary; when something I once thought real drops\
  \ away outside the mutual agreement of those of my country or family of origin,\
  \ in places where it simply does not exist. With this spirit, on 6th August 2017\
  \ I stood at the edge of the wilderness, Africa\u2019s oldest nature reserve behind\
  \ me and an expanse of land that refused to conform to any paradigm, or abide by\
  \ any social constructs I had ever known, in front of me. I had waited a year to\
  \ get here, one of the few places I could experience the electricity of life untamed,\
  \ where life walked free and congruent over the plains, and man held no sway. I\
  \ was about to enter on foot, with 6 others, an area populated by lions, hyenas,\
  \ rhinos, and a myriad of other animals in the heart of Zululand; an area protected\
  \ from vehicles, construction and tourism. Much as I had longed for this experience\
  \ I was challenged by it, the desire for a deeper experience of life involved, ironically,\
  \ facing the fear of death. My mind, habituated to shielding me to my experiences,\
  \ whether through its interpretations or choosing my level of interaction, was at\
  \ last defeated by the louder voice of my body; there was no denying that I was\
  \ 60kg in an area of several hundred lions where I would stay for the next 8 days.\
  \ Feeling my body tremble I knew my mind couldn\u2019t choose the experience I was\
  \ about to have, this was not a land where man constructed the rules; my body would\
  \ track reality in every moment. As I followed Zondi further into the wilderness\
  \ I was both alert and relaxed: the level of presence required of me was such that\
  \ I was no longer a tourist in a foreign country, or even in my own life \u2013\
  \ I was a full participant.\n\nThe next morning I witnessed a wild dog bring down\
  \ an impala. Between the dogs, vultures, hyenas and the horn borer moths that over\
  \ the coming months would devour its horns, nothing was wasted, nothing was lost\
  \ from the system; even death itself served Life. Already my perspective had shifted:\
  \ it was not a question of my life or the impala\u2019s life, but Life, to which\
  \ we all belonged.\n\n48 hours later as I sat by the fire at night, while those\
  \ around me slept on the ground trusting me to keep watch, I was no longer looking\
  \ at the world; I was part of it. It was only now that I understood the veil I had\
  \ cast aside was not a house, tent or vehicle but my mind itself."
