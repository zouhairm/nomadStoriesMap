Text: "We dragged our bikes up the muddy track. Brown sludge caked the wheels, branches\
  \ stuck in the spokes, our panting was faster than our feet. Ofa the only English\
  \ speaker we knew in Tonga had mapped it out for us by pencil. It took us three\
  \ trips around the village to find the unmarked access. \u2018Eua island locals\
  \ stopped to stare. Sisters they called us, but Sam was the striking, tanned counterpart\
  \ to my pale, simple features.\n\nKids with billboard smiles waved at us calling,\
  \ \u201Cbye.\u201D Did they want us to stay or go? Ofa said \u2018Eua had very few\
  \ outsiders. He liked it that way. Let Vava\u2019u have the famous humpback whales,\
  \ Fiji the tourists. \u2018Eua was untouched. \n\nOfa was the owner of the lodge\
  \ where we were staying and our self-appointed tour guide. He had failed to mention\
  \ that after a night of rain the bike track would be a swamp of debris. When we\
  \ reached the top, a man laughed at our muddy exteriors, \u201Cdid you fall?\u201D\
  \ We hadn\u2019t. \n\nThe track morphed into another village on a dirt road.  Wild\
  \ pigs and horses roamed between thatched rooves. Sun baked the pavement. Sam had\
  \ grown up in Cambodia, she loved the steep cliffs. Born in Scotland, I was enamoured\
  \ with the banana trees. Sam shrugged. Ofa said \nTonga had resisted colonisation\
  \ in the 1900s. Everyone was given two pieces of land at birth, one to live and\
  \ one to grow crops. They couldn\u2019t be sold.\n\nWe cycled another hour before\
  \ I realised my bike was faulty. I had thought I was the rusty one. Ofa drove by,\
  \ offering us a ride. I nodded. Sam refused. Another guest, mentioned he was going\
  \ to buy Ofa a cushion for his jeep. Ofa said that a lot of foreigners break their\
  \ promises.  \nOfa was a new Jehovah\u2019s Witness. I had never met a Jehovah\u2019\
  s Witness before that wasn\u2019t on my doorstep. On \u2018Eua it is illegal to\
  \ work on Sundays. Ofa said many Tongan\u2019s Christianity was religious, his wasn\u2019\
  t.\n\nLeaving \u2018Eua, the ferry attendants prayed over the loud speaker. Women\
  \ and children slept on mats, men sat around the side to shield them from the crashing\
  \ waves. Sam and I laid out our sleeping bags, offering travel sickness pills to\
  \ our new Brazilian friends. They declined. I woke to find them scowling over me,\
  \ \u201Cwe want your happy pills.\u201D\n\nOn our final night we stayed on a resort\
  \ island, eating cereal to keep costs down. Manicured beaches, clipped palm trees,\
  \ the resort was a living postcard. But when I shut my eyes I saw only Ofa\u2019\
  s \u2018Eua. Its jagged bushes, uneven trees, rocks that collided with the sand.\
  \ Its imperfect perfection."
