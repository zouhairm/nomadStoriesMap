Text: In modern day Portland, Oregon, a young, impressionable woman, Cassidy Reynolds,
  stumbles across an idea, novel to her until that point; living without fear. In
  her life, she is constantly facing mundane fears; how to avoid awkward eye contact
  with people you sort-of know in the grocery store, how to pay your bills, to make
  the right choices, to live and work your 9-5, never becoming too successful too
  fast. The thought of traveling the world is an unreachable dream for her. Until
  a friend urges her strongly to follow her heart to an Art Show in Dublin, Ireland,
  Cassidy's only experience with traveling was a two hour drive to the coast. As the
  plane touches on Irish soil, she can slowly feel her world changing. The story follows
  Cassidy through her one week visit to Ireland. It touches upon the nervousness and
  excitement of International Traveling, as well as the pleasant surprise of getting
  lost in the wild, green of Ireland. The story focuses on candid thoughts and feelings
  that we, as humans, feel and face each day. From talking to an ex, to leaving the
  last red rose on someone's casket at a funeral, we tiptoe through life, as if we
  will make it safely to death. But some things, as little as boarding a plane and
  crossing an ocean, can leave us different people when we return; and no matter how
  we prepare for it, it will never be what we expected.
