Text: "I am standing at the edge of a precipice, eschewing the sheer drop to my left\
  \ and the steep, slippery slope to my right\u2014all the while being seduced by\
  \ the pristine waters of Mooney Falls below; but the only way down is to grip the\
  \ flimsy and muddy chain nailed to the burnt-orange stone wall and follow descent\
  \ of the makeshift steps. This is no dream. Paralyzed by this harrowing thought,\
  \ I understand this is the price I have to pay for a piece of paradise. My friends\
  \ disappear below me, unfazed and insouciant, and I am alone. The cacophony of the\
  \ waterfall crashing below tries to drown my fear and urge me on. I exhale, consciously\
  \ relax my muscles, and introspect.\n\nI remember my first day in Moscow, Russia.\
  \ It was the summer a record heat wave caused wildfires in the outskirts, and a\
  \ thick smog enveloped the city. I was sitting on my bed by the window praying for\
  \ a breeze, a miracle, a connection. I had no working phone, no internet or wifi\
  \ set up, no rubles exchanged, no friends, no family. The ineluctable ramifications\
  \ of my decision to move here were frightening and exhilarating. I had expected\
  \ to withstand long, frigid winters and develop a blunt attitude; instead, with\
  \ my sweaty shirt stuck to my chest, this was my pragmatic introduction to the endurance\
  \ that lies at the crux of the Russian soul, traces of which are visible on every\
  \ passerby\u2019s solemn physiognomy. This city is a juxtaposition of extremes,\
  \ neither good nor bad, in a perpetual state of change, both hot and cold, familiar\
  \ yet new, with melancholic undertones of nostalgia permeating its essence. This\
  \ day is etched vividly into my soul, a living emblem of this sensation, like a\
  \ video installation loop on my memory shelf, only ever a mere glance away. Not\
  \ only did I survive the heat wave that year, I went on to endure five consecutive\
  \ Russian winters. I hated it\u2014and I loved it. That first day had prepared me\
  \ for my current impasse.\n\nBack on the edge, still overwhelmed with fear but driven\
  \ to overcome it, I emerge from my reveries. My two choices are clear: play it safe\
  \ and go back, or face my acrophobia and keep going. Potential future memories of\
  \ a paradise well-earned flood my mind, and I know this will become my new favorite\
  \ place\u2014once I make it down. The turquoise waters beckon again, interrupting\
  \ my introspection, and, abandoning my diffidence, I make my choice, the only one\
  \ worth considering. With a first step down, heart pounding, I\u2019ve never felt\
  \ more alive."
