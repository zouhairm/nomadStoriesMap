Text: Barcelona has changed my life like when you read a book, you see a movie or
  somehow the information enters your head  giving voice and form to something that
  always had been there, polishing and giving strength to a hiden idea who lives in
  some corner of your brain and releasing light and fireworks that clarify a bit more
  of the uncertainty that surrounds us. Freedom is not false, but not easy either.
  Personally I understand freedom as absence of impediments to do what you want with
  your life, but the potholes are not always bitter present The key to the case is
  in knowing and evaluating. We are conditioned from birth to a lifestyle pretty prototypical
  where we get money for form a family and enjoy the few moments of peace that the
  holidays give us to give rein release our wishes, here we find a weapon of double
  edged because it's a good life, but like everything in the world what is good for
  some, even if they are a immense majority does not have to be ideal for everyone.
  But what if I could convert those desires, that things that i love doing and for
  what I've been willing to spend my life working in an office in my way of life?
  So necessary is for me a car, a house owned or a mobile last generation like to
  give up a life of travel, joy and knowledge? I had already made that decision time
  from a cloud of dust that haunted my mind and in Barcelona he joined to give shape
  to what today I consider the cornerstone of my way of being. As once a very wise
  and dear person told me, you can live happily with little, but also with less than
  little. My priorities have changed, I have known a life of abundance, riches and
  impediments and a more austere life but free and happy, the decision is made.
