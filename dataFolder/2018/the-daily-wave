Text: "They call Gjirokast\xEBr 'the stone city', a place where grand old Ottoman-style\
  \ houses hug the hillsides and locals tell you which stones to step on so as not\
  \ to slip down the steep cobblestone streets. But many of these glorious stone houses\
  \ are abandoned and severely dilapidated, with broken windows, crumbling walls and\
  \ piles of rubbish inside. Gaping windows and crumbling facades are the unfortunate\
  \ reality of heritage preservation in a poor country. \n\nThe people too are like\
  \ the houses: hardened by years under communist isolation, shattered by life circumstances\
  \ since, but resilient nevertheless, still standing despite the elements. Like Salaam,\
  \ a man I met while I was feeding street kittens.\n\nHe lived in the same house\
  \ as a family of stray cats, in a small stone room on a corner with a door that\
  \ wouldn't lock and a front porch crowded with rubbish. The cats scouted for scraps\
  \ underneath the nearby dumpster while he scrounged around inside it. Salaam's window\
  \ overlooked the intersection of one of the main pedestrian streets with a steep\
  \ little alley to a nearby hotel terrace, and it was there that we first met, he\
  \ looking down from his window, me looking up from the street, united by a wave\
  \ of the hand. A brief moment of connection before I continued on my usual walk\
  \ and he slumped back into a stupor.\n\nWe went on in this fashion for the next\
  \ week and it became my daily highlight. But one day, something changed. Salaam\
  \ came outside to greet me in person. And so we finally met, in the tumbledown,\
  \ rubble-strewn threshold of his house. He spoke no English and my Albanian was\
  \ limited to greetings, but we understood each other perfectly: he was hungry. His\
  \ eyes were rheumy red. He wore the same tattered old shirt and suit jacket each\
  \ day. But he was grateful to God for his blessings. I brought him food the next\
  \ day. And then again, whatever I could scrounge from breakfast leftovers at my\
  \ hostel.\n\nToo soon though, my time in Albania was over and I was at Salaam's\
  \ rickety door one last time, with a message in Albanian on my iPad that read \u2018\
  I go to Greece tomorrow. I wish you luck\u2019. We shook hands for the last time\
  \ and Salaam made a heartfelt speech in Albanian. I couldn't understand a word he\
  \ said, but I could feel the sentiment nonetheless.\n\nI asked if I could take his\
  \ photo and he puffed himself up with pride, this broken but beautiful old man.\n\
  \nAnd one last time, we waved goodbye, our wave saying everything it needed to say,\
  \ in a language understood by all."
