Text: "When I stepped off of the boat and onto the dock of Cay Cauke, Belize I had\
  \ no previous expectation of what would be nor had I secured any accommodations\
  \ for my stay. Immediately I was compelled by the clarity of the water below my\
  \ feet as I absorbed the additional scenery. It was late afternoon and the sun was\
  \ just beginning to droop on the horizon between a few palms that swayed in the\
  \ island breeze. I knew that I needed to get moving before losing all light. There\
  \ was a man on the dock who embodied Bob Marley with wisdom woven into the dreads\
  \ that lay down his back. \u201CExcuse me there\u201D I said admist the sound of\
  \ lapping water. \u201CI\u2019m wondering which direction I should head for a bed\
  \ tonight?\u201D \u201CWhat\u2019s you name?\u201D the Rasta man proclaimed energetically.\
  \ \u201CJohnny\u201D  I said. \u201CJOHNNY\u201D! \u201CListen man, you are brother\
  \ now and you\u2019re going to stay with me!\u201D and he abruptly grabbed my bag.\
  \ I knew that this scenario could have gone one of two ways but I still chose the\
  \ latter because I knew deep down that the proceedings events would entail interesting.\
  \ And so we went down the street stopping off once at the local revolving door house\
  \ which was the kind of place where you come and go but always leave with more than\
  \ when you came. So we continued went-ing until we reached the two last bungalows\
  \ on the culdasak a step away from the shoreline where the water is so still it\
  \ barely laps but it does. Now this wasn\u2019t the type of culdasak you might find\
  \ off Main Street middle America. In fact there weren\u2019t any cars whatsoever\
  \ - only bicycles and the occasional golf carriage. Their weren\u2019t any golf\
  \ courses or manicured lawns yet the place kept its shape. The layout of the island\
  \ was the shape a cucumber with a few open spaces between to roam and a 20 minute\
  \ bike ride from end to end. One held the idealistic cabana bar with lounge and\
  \ drink umbrellas. You could sit on half submersed stools and sip your fruit infused\
  \ concoction. On the other side if the mass was a huge white Gustavo house overlooking\
  \ a dishelved beach. This was neither nor was it the resort - this was the slums.\
  \ A bottling factory processed Coca-Cola cans and beer bottles were returned was\
  \ in eyesview across the street and strange ladies stared as the passer byer past.\
  \ Jahsunn finagled a key from under a rock and opened the dual dead bolts, swung\
  \ open the plywood door, and we enetered the  darkened opening. He flipped a couple\
  \ of switches which dimly illuminated the place. It took a moment for my eyes to\
  \ adjust..."
