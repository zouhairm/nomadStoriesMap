Text: "Known as the \u201Ccity of the sun,\u201D Natal doesn\u2019t disappoint me\
  \ \u2014 when I step off the plane, the sun kisses my face and welcomes me home.\n\
  It\u2019s been 3 years since I last visited my hometown in northeastern Brazil and\
  \ I suspect a lot will be different since the last time I was here. On the way to\
  \ my family's house we pass the Newton Navarro Bridge, which crosses the Potengi\
  \ River and connects Natal\u2019s north and south shores. The bridge offers a breathtaking\
  \ view of the the city and from it I see how Natal has grown since my last visit.\
  \ I open my window to feel the warm breeze and take it all in.\nI don\u2019t know\
  \ if it\u2019s the jet lag or the sheer excitement of being back home, but the next\
  \ day I wake up at 5:30am, look out my window and see the most beautiful sunrise.\
  \ So I rush outside and stand by the swimming pool, where I soak up the tranquility\
  \ for almost an hour. The rest of the day is spent on a beach soaking up the sun\
  \ and drinking all the coconut water and caipirinha I possibly can.\nThe most anticipated\
  \ day of my trip arrives on Feb.24, the day Natal\u2019s carnival begins. From my\
  \ apartment window I hear people laughing, dancing and partying like there\u2019\
  s not a single worry on their mind. At 7pm. on the first night of the carnival,\
  \ the music gets louder on the street in front of my apartment and dancing breaks\
  \ out. In all the time I lived in Brazil, I never attended one of these and the\
  \ experience is amazing. Let\u2019s just say, you don\u2019t know what a party is\
  \ until you\u2019ve been to a carnival street party. The street quickly fills up\
  \ with a sea of people, and I get to meet some of the neighbourhood kids I grew\
  \ up with. After 2 days of street parties, I\u2019m ready for something more relaxing.\
  \ So I retreat to one of my favourite places in the world, Pipa Beach.\nIt\u2019\
  s hard to describe Pipa, an incredibly beautiful place that everyone seems to fall\
  \ in love with at first glance. Pipa has a unique vibe to it, it\u2019s carefree\
  \ and home to many immigrants, who simply never returned home after visiting this\
  \ beach. That\u2019s the power of Pipa.\nFinally, on my last day in Natal I enjoy\
  \ the company of family and friends over a nice lunch and I leave with such a mix\
  \ of feelings and emotions. I knew the second I left my aunt\u2019s home that I\
  \ would miss the Brazilian way of living. Brazilians are an incredibly happy people\
  \ and the way they see beauty and happiness everywhere, and enjoy even the most\
  \ simple of things is how we should all appreciate life.\nI cannot wait to go back\
  \ and experience it all over again.\nUntil next time, Brazil."
