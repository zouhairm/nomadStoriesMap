Text: "It was a hot day in June. The jeep was driving me back to Bamako after a long\
  \ day in Kangabe. The wheels were cutting through bumpy roads, breathing out smoke\
  \ and dust. I let my eyes carelessly wander over the surrounding scenery, while\
  \ the air-con engulfed me with feigned freshness. \nMy thoughts were twirling aimlessly,\
  \ until the driver broke their dance: \"do you want to see an open-pit gold mine?\"\
  . \nI was exhausted, but the proposition was so enticing that I instantly said yes.\
  \ Treasure hunting suddenly became real!\nWe parked the car and stepped out to what\
  \ seemed to be an inferno. With a temperature of 40 \u02DAC, I wondered if life\
  \ is possible in such an arid land. The trees were painfully bare and eyed shyly\
  \ the ripe orange hanging in the sky. Everything succumbed to the heat. The colors\
  \ of the atmosphere were orange and yellow, as if the sun has poured its juices\
  \ on us, tainting the air with flaming colors that stalled my breathing. \nFew meters\
  \ down the path, the trees gave way to a massive open stretch of land pierced with\
  \ at least a dozen holes, resembling the craters of dead volcanoes. The crimson\
  \ soil was like dried lava. In and around those pits, more than 100 artisanal miners\
  \ were digging with their bare hands, their backs bent, as if pulled by the gold's\
  \ gravity. No one wore shoes. \"Their feet must have developed a natural protective\
  \ sole\", I thought. Equipped with rusty metallic pots and rudimentary tools, they\
  \ washed the soil panning for gold. \nMy face and neck were suffused with pearls\
  \ of sweat, glittering like the gold I imagined coming out to the surface. \n\"\
  We've been here since 5 a.m.\", a young man suddenly said.\nI calculate: that's\
  \ 12 hours.\n\"Have you found anything yet?\", I ask.\n\"Sadly no, not today \"\
  , he replies.\nI kept watching and waiting for at least an hour, dust filling up\
  \ my lungs, realizing that this is how some people make their living. \nSuddenly,\
  \ a cry breaks-out!\nJackpot! \nA man approaches me with his palm wide open. I look\
  \ at his parched skin, criss-crossed by lines diverging and intersecting randomly,\
  \ and spot a reddish powder spread delicately like scattered dust of a celestial\
  \ body. I sigh, taking my time to savour the earth's delights and indulge in mother\
  \ nature's abundance. It was gold in its purest form!    \nThat day, even though\
  \ I marveled at seeing a real treasure for the first time in my life, I couldn't\
  \ but wonder: \"how come that in a land where gold is a natural fertilizer, poverty\
  \ is the only thing that's growing?"
