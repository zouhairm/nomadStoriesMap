Text: "I was hitchhiking a loop around North America when I found myself in headwater\
  \ meadow highlands. \n\nChocolate Mountain was to the East, Mount Goode to the North.\
  \ Lakes with sandy shorelines sat ceremoniously surrounded by granite cliffs. The\
  \ alpine tarns were sapphire, jade, turquoise \u2014 many with red, orange, and\
  \ purple mineral deposits pooled in wonderful various dimension. Pika rabbits bobbed\
  \ in and out of their seas of stone. \n\nI\u2019d scour the highland paths and remove\
  \ crushed beer cans, caps, nails, broken bottles, barbed wire, all kind of plastic\
  \ and aluminum. \L\LI'd do supply runs and haul out rubbish for us a couple times\
  \ every week. \L\LWhen leaving, I hid my tent by climbing up massive granite slabs\
  \ of glacial debris, then I slid down on my back into the intricate caverns of immense\
  \ white stone which lay inside a petrified glacier. Ice-like but made entirely of\
  \ earth. \n\nOne evening I emerged from the woods and found a Forest Ranger poking\
  \ around the parking zone where the dumpsters were. He asked me why I was carrying\
  \ huge bags of charcoal and garbage, and I told him I was friends with Sebastian.\
  \ \n\nSebastian lived at the Eastern base of the Sierra Nevada, at the end of the\
  \ road, alongside the US 395. I was visiting some hot springs in the area, on my\
  \ way to an eco-village in Nicaragua, when he asked me to help him with his conservation\
  \ efforts along the peaks. \n\nAt seventy-one, Sebastian\u2019s clothes awkwardly\
  \ swallowed his tiny frame, and his boney butt crack was always poking out when\
  \ we worked. He put up bamboo fencing around the gardens so he could be nude on\
  \ his property without offending the neighbors. He also liked to honk and wave at\
  \ the oldest trees on the main roadways. He kept a garden with tomato, zucchini\
  \ squash, carrot, sweet pea, raspberry, pumpkin, blueberry, and broccoli. \n\nSebastian\
  \ believes that the best way to live is by devoting yourself to simple, respectful,\
  \ and honest crafts of the world.. so that all good projects ripen in good time,\
  \ like a cask of red wine. \n\nIn our region of the Sierra Nevada, you could come\
  \ up over a pass and see a landscape of wild beauty so perfect you\u2019d swear\
  \ it was your own fantasy crossing dimensions. \n\nIn the evenings I would crawl\
  \ body-sore into my tent and listen to the birds squawk at the sunset. At night,\
  \ a tea candle lit my tent, showing the shadows of ants and beetles crawling upsides\
  \ curiously. Everywhere I go, I find there's always an opportunity to connect with\
  \ the land and the people of it."
