Text: "My father, a sailing freak and aspiring circumnavigator of the globe asked\
  \ me to come to my second Baltic sea yacht cruise. Without hesitation, I said yes.\
  \ The last sailing adventure hasn\xB4t exactly been the easy-going vacation you\
  \ would dream of, while imagining a yacht cruise with your family. You probably\
  \ would expect chilled evenings with a bottle of wine (which we bought for the trip,\
  \ but never even opened), some shanty singing (which we were simply too exhausted\
  \ for) and the sun shining on your slowly tanning beachbody while you glide on the\
  \ calm waves of bliss. Well, we\xB4ve had none of that. Instead, I\xB4ve experienced\
  \ tiring nightshifts to reach the next harbour on time, bruises all over my pale\
  \ body, as the merciless waves tossed me from starboard to port side and serious\
  \ situations that, looking back, could have easily turned to lifethreatening ones.\
  \ Oh, and did I mention seasickness? \nStrangely, I suppressed all these bad memories.\
  \ I still had this romantic image in my head, that kept me wanting to do this all\
  \ over again. \nFast-forward to a night in last year\xB4s June. My bus, that should\
  \ take me from Germany to Poland, arrives on the shady parking lot. I turn to my\
  \ boyfriend and give him a hug to say goodbye. Without warning, I freeze. My arms\
  \ become stiff and entagle around my boyfriend\xB4s torso. Warm liquid starts to\
  \ moisten my fear-ridden face. I feel shell shocked. All these undigested feelings\
  \ of helplessness, all the anxiety and dismay come back. All at once. \u201EWhy\
  \ the hell am I doing this to myself? I could book a flight to Egypt, go to an all\
  \ inclusive 4-star hotel and just chill by the pool for two weeks straight. I could\
  \ relax for once! I don\xB4t need this stress! I\xB4ve got enough stress at work\
  \ all year. I don\xB4t need anymore during vacation. I can\xB4t freaking do this\
  \ and I don\xB4t want to. That\xB4s simply selfdestruction.\u201C That is basically\
  \ the flow of thoughts I have. But with more swear words, I wouldn\xB4t like to\
  \ expose you all to. I know, I should do it. As an 24-year-old anxious young woman\
  \ that\xB4s getting stressed even by a telephone call with a stranger, I should\
  \ do this to finally win some self-confidence and strength. Then it hits me. I\xB4\
  m not doing this for myself. I\xB4m doing this for my dad, whom I see once a year.\
  \ I think about his passion for sailing and his closeness with the sea and I understand\
  \ that this closeness gets me closer to him, as well. Still crying, I let go of\
  \ my boyfriend, take my backpack and enter the bus to Szczecin."
