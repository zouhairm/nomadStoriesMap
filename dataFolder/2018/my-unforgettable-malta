Text: "One day I decided to go to an interchange fair to get some information about\
  \ where to go. An interchange had been a dream of mine ever since I was too young.\n\
  When I suddenly saw a picture of what it turned out to be an amazing place, that\
  \ place was Malta! I wasn\u2019t really familiar with that country or its culture\
  \ at the time but I got a brochure and read about the Island and I thought: \u201C\
  That\xB4s the country I want to go to and that\xB4s the experience I want to have\u201D\
  . A place to study English that was not a regular destination (at least to my knowledge\
  \ at that time).\nStill I thought, that decision was pushing me to the edge. The\
  \ fear of the unknown is something we must cross over at some point and what we\
  \ get in return with the new experiences is totally worth it.\nI started doing research\
  \ about Malta (on websites, blogs and youtube), the food, the main religion practiced\
  \ there, the architecture, the history and the people. And I found myself getting\
  \ more and more fascinated about the Island and the prospect of one day going there.\
  \ \nSo that was my choice! Was it a good one? How would I know? I must have lived\
  \ and felt that!\nI had the chance to study in one of the best English schools in\
  \ Malta (EC), I met a lot of people and made some special friends from all different\
  \ places.\nI went to a Medieval Festival in Mdina (\u201CLa Citta Vechia\u201D or\
  \ also called The Silent City) where part of Game Thrones was shot, I went to the\
  \ Nutella and the Strawberry festivals, I visited the Popeye Village where the movie\
  \ was recorded, I was able to go to amazing beaches with cold water of the Mediterranean,\
  \ museums and catacombs, I saw unforgettable sunsets while drinking good wines at\
  \ the Djingli Cliffs.\nI got to eat some typical and local food like pastizzi (a\
  \ traditional savoury pastry that it\u2019s usually filled with either ricotta or\
  \ mushy peas) and Fenek (rabbit stew, considered a national dish since the Knights\
  \ of St John), I tried this amazing barbecue made by a Libian friend and I enjoyed\
  \ this tasty and juicy pasta made by an Italian roommate. I went through some situation\
  \ that the knowledge of other idioms helped me a lot. I felt I experienced a lot\
  \ of things and I was able to learn and soak it all in, even from the tougher moments.\n\
  So...\nI couldn\xB4t have done a better choice, Malta is still in my heart, my memories,\
  \ my soul and also on my body as a cross of Malta tattoo. Certainly it was a wonderful\
  \ experience that I\xB4ll carry with me for my entire life."
