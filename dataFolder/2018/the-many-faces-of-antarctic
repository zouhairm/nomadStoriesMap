Text: "Gliding in a vast frozen landscape, propelled by the stroke of my paddle, I\
  \ was astounded to witness the beauty and diversity of this often-thought-of hostile\
  \ environment, the one and only Antarctica.  Surrounded by the indescribable grandiosity\
  \ of mountains and glaciers and the friendliest of wildlife, I felt my heart and\
  \ soul open to the infinite possibility that is Antarctica; the possibility of what\
  \ this planet could be.\n\nKnown as the coldest, driest, most inhospitable continent\
  \ on the planet Antarctica conjures images of gale force winds over an empty white\
  \ landscape, but what I found was an ever-changing wilderness; the many faces of\
  \ Antarctica. The relatively flat crossing of the Drake lulled me into a calm that\
  \ was smashed upon arrival at the fittingly named Deception Island. In the relative\
  \ protection of the caldera, the rain and hail blew sideways. \n\nDown on the Peninsula\
  \ we awoke to not a breath of wind. An overcast day sprinkled with radiating beams\
  \ of light was perfect for our first kayaking adventure. Kayaking in Antarctica\
  \ is sensational; the taste of crystal clear air, the visual feast of grand mountains\
  \ and uniquely shaped bergs, echoes of calving glaciers and of course the stench\
  \ of the penguin colonies! Just as the landscape is sensational, the curious wildlife\
  \ fills you with wonder. There is nothing empty about Antarctica. Minke whales swam\
  \ under kayaks whilst spyhopping humpbacks winked at people on zodiacs. Seals frolicked\
  \ in the water then lazed contentedly on chunks of ice. The penguins so fast and\
  \ agile in the water waddled awkwardly on land, whilst multitudes of birds sailed\
  \ overhead. With no fear of humans, the animals are just as curious of us as we\
  \ are of them. This is humanity and nature as it should be, as I\u2019m sure it\
  \ once was, living in harmony with a sense of mutual respect. \n\nStill Antarctica\
  \ had more. Perfect blue-sky days and sunsets glowing with pink, orange and yellow\
  \ hues. The myriad of colours in Antarctica is surprising. Our final paddle revealed\
  \ a new face; a total grey out where the horizon blended between sea and sky. If\
  \ it weren\u2019t for the ice, you could easily imagine becoming disorientated.\
  \ Rather than being disappointed, I was grateful that Antarctica had let me see\
  \ yet another one of her faces. A breathless, quiet, grey stillness.\n\nAt the bottom\
  \ of the Earth I had found a world of possibilities, a deep connection between humanity\
  \ and nature and a blueprint for how life on this planet really could exist."
