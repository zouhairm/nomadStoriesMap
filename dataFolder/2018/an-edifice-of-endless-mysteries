Text: "I was at Sulaymaniyah Mosque, searching for a short guy who described himself\
  \ to be in a yellow coat. Him, who was hired by my Turkish friend to guide me around\
  \ until the time of my connection flight to India.\nI immediately approached when\
  \ I saw him. He was a friendly gent. \u201CSo, we should start seeing around?! I\
  \ have 5 hours in Istanbul!\u201D I reminded him. He gave a strange look, then said\
  \ \u201CWhy not?\u201D\nSo, did the tour begin with the Mosque.\nA colossal, architectural\
  \ magnificence it was. Reflecting the talent of old artisans and penmen in its embroideries\
  \ and calligraphies on the walls and pillars. It shouted of an exquisite culture\
  \ which I newly was encountering. Its tranquil, bright, colorful ambiance reverberated\
  \ a singular faith of billions on earth.\n\u201CThose amid the lamps of the chandelier,\
  \ are ostrich eggs!\u201D he suggested.\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\u201CThe Architect\
  \ Sinan put them there! Which now is a tradition at farms and greenhouses to use\
  \ them! The ostrich eggs are known to emit an unbearable odor for the pests -which\
  \ the human nose cannot detect! It has kept that big above dome clean of insects\
  \ for 400 years!\u201D he said.\n\u201CImpressive!\u201D\nAt mosque\u2019s courtyard,\
  \ the boy pointed to one of the four minarets which was at the left of the entry\
  \ gate. \u201COnce, the erection of the mosque was delayed. And the Iranian shah\
  \ Tahmasp, sent a chest full of precious gems to Sultan Suleyman, erroneously taunting\
  \ the Imperial fiscal to be deficient! Well, prudent was our ancestor. As Suleyman\
  \ in front of the messenger, fiercely declared that each stone of the edifice was\
  \ dearer than of those gems! He called the Architect, and ordered to mix them up\
  \ with the other rocks and use as a construction material! Well you see that minaret;\
  \ its name is Gem in my language!\u201D\nWhile his narration was flawless and the\
  \ history was sublime, \u201CAny of these things, not written in web-pages\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\u201CYou cannot find all, nor the better truth except where it was born,\
  \ carried out, and left its marks upon the descendants!\u201D he concluded.\nSome\
  \ hours later, \u201CHere\u2019s your money\u201D I said to him.\n\u201CWhat money?\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhich you did your job for!\u201D\n\u201CWhat job, Miss?\u201D\nAftermath,\
  \ when we found out that I mistakenly took him as a tour-guide, we laughed out loud.\
  \ He and I found it eccentrically funny. And he still didn't keep the money.\nBut\
  \ he taught me; That our world was wider than it looked, the history could be longer\
  \ than it has been yet written. And that a random person could've been a better,\
  \ richer, friendlier source of knowledge."
