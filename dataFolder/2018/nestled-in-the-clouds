Text: "My journey had reached its penultimate stage. I was waiting at the Leh airport,\
  \ ready to fly off to Delhi from where I'd board for Dubai the next day. I felt\
  \ content and relieved. My trip was everything and more than what I had expected,\
  \ the adventure I sought to have. Just over a year ago I had lost my mom, a month\
  \ back I had broken up with the love of my life and was now stuck in a job I hated.\
  \ Depression was starting to control my life and I knew I had to get away, from\
  \ life. . My reason to go on this solo trip was to get away from rut I was being\
  \ sucked into, to find myself again. As an avid adventurer I always enjoy elements\
  \ of randomness in my travels. \n\nAnd these two weeks had given me a new lease\
  \ of life. I had made some amazing friends, run into complete strangers who did\
  \ not give a second thought before running to my aid, and had more than a couple\
  \ of times cheated death. Leh was without a doubt the most beautiful place I had\
  \ ever seen. The ragged roads that took you to Khardungla were surrounded by brute\
  \ mountains that made you doubt if you were on the moon. The Nubra valley housed\
  \ turquoise lakes which were looked upon by multi Coloured Mountains stretched on\
  \ either side. And of course now I had earned the bragging rights of officially\
  \ having completed the holy grail of the Indian motor biking trail. \n\nAlbeit small,\
  \ the airport looked beautiful nestled in between all the Blue Mountains. I sat\
  \ beside a bunch of Americans who looked overjoyed and overwhelmed by India. Every\
  \ time an Indian pop song came on the tele they broke out into synchronised dance\
  \ steps. Their dance routine was however disrupted by an announcement on the loud\
  \ speaker. The announcer bellowed \" this is a message for Mr Shukla from Mrs Shukla,\
  \  Mr Shukla this is for your attention, \" I thought to myself, oh boy she's lost\
  \ herself in the airport. \nHe continued \" Mr Shukla, this is urgent, your wife\
  \ Mrs Shukla,.. \nWants you to wish you a very happy birthday\u201D\nThe whole airport\
  \ erupted with claps and laughter. Some even started singing for the young couple.\
  \ \nIndia had truly won me over again."
