Text: "It was my third year living in China and my second week in The Tongbai Palace,\
  \ one of the famous Taoist temples in southern China and I was hoping for a professional\
  \ opportunity in my life while I enjoyed a mystical experience.\n\nEventually I\
  \ got a great job for an international cosmetic company in Shenzhen but life had\
  \ a nasty surprise waiting for me.\n\nI went to Shanghai to leave my passport in\
  \ an agency to renew my visa. When I was outside a friend called asking me if I\
  \ was interested in working a few days handing out flyers at the entrance of a disco\
  \ 300 km away, \u201CWhy not?\u201D I thought, money is always welcome before starting\
  \ a new life. \n\nAfter an eight hour journey it was dark when I got to a very old\
  \ and rickety bus station. The sixty year old owner of the discotheque came by taxi\
  \ to pick me up accompanied by two towering Chinese young men. \nThey pushed me\
  \ into the taxi and we arrived at a building and upon seeing the bright red neon\
  \ lights I started to feel afraid. I didn\u2019t know any words in Chinese but I\
  \ understood what they wanted me to do for the coming nights\u2026 pole dancing\
  \ for Pakistani clients.\n\nIf they liked my dancing they would \u201Cpay me\u201D\
  \ by putting huge baskets with flowers on the stage. But how was I supposed to dance\
  \ with the pole? What would happen to me if I didn\u2019t get any baskets? How could\
  \ I escape from that place without getting hurt?\n\nSuddenly I was on stage, wearing\
  \ the only dress I brought: a typical red and white polka-dotted Spanish flamenco\
  \ dress. They asked me what song I wanted to dance to and I said, \u201CWaka Waka\u201D\
  \ by Shakira.\nThe whole thing was a disaster. Results : zero baskets.\n\n The next\
  \ night I only got two baskets and was given a ticket to prove it but a girl stole\
  \ it from me and hid it in her bra.\nA client invited me to a room and when he closed\
  \ the door I pushed him away and ran out to get my stuff and escape.\n\nWhen the\
  \ drunken owner found out he came to find me, I punched him and I ran away as fast\
  \ as I could. In that moment I was happy to have Viking blood in my veins.\n\nI\
  \ got to the train station but all the trains were full. I saw an old rickshaw and\
  \ I got in, after twenty minutes we arrived to a highway, I hitch-hiked and a nice\
  \ black car stopped. Luckily the driver spoke English; he was an important business\
  \ man in the fashion industry. I felt like my luck was finally changing.\n\nAfter\
  \ 5 hours I arrived to my visa agency in Shanghai, I got my passport and I cried\
  \ as a child\u2026the nightmare was over."
