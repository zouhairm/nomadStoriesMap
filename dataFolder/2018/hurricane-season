Text: "With the sun on my face and an umbrella in my drink, I dug my happy toes in\
  \ the sand. The water was an unreal shade of blue, like an Instagram filter had\
  \ been applied to real life. I was on an island, somewhere in the Caribbean, with\
  \ no clue as to the day of the week, and not a single care. Was I living in a Jimmy\
  \ Buffett song?\n\nFive months earlier, I quit the 9-5, packed up my condo and boarded\
  \ a cruise ship with a job in entertainment. I couldn\u2019t help but smile, when\
  \ I found that \u2018work\u2019 involved hosting sand castle building events, leading\
  \ dance parties and judging margarita competitions. I played on the beaches of Aruba,\
  \ ate dutch pancakes in Curacao, flew kites in San Juan, made friends from all over\
  \ the world and got paid to do it. Life was perfect. But, as it goes, perfection\
  \ never lasts long.\n\nAt 55, my dad was young and healthy. So, when he inexplicably\
  \ lost mobility in his left foot, we were at a loss. The test results were in, so\
  \ I called home. Looking through a porthole over Nassau, I was told my dad had ALS.\
  \ This cruel disease slowly takes away a person\u2019s ability to walk, talk and\
  \ eventually breathe on their own. There is no known cause or cure of any kind.\
  \ It is fatal 100% of the time.\n\nI retreated to my cabin and broke down. An hour\
  \ later, with a fake smile glued to my face, I hosted \u201980\u2019s Music\u2019\
  \ trivia on Lido. It was heartbreaking. The selfless, kindhearted man I loved was\
  \ undeserving of this fate.\n\nThe disease moved slowly, but eventually, I came\
  \ home from the sea to help care for my dad in Indiana. Full of gratitude and positivity,\
  \ he was a calming force. It's easy to care for a person like that. Putting a pause\
  \ on my adventures was simple, but I could see in his eyes that he felt he was holding\
  \ me back.\n\nOne night, an odd sound in his breath caused me to check on him. With\
  \ a dimpled smile, he said, \u201COh, Little Leah. I\u2019m fine.\u201D It was the\
  \ only time my dad ever lied to me. The next afternoon, he sat down for a nap in\
  \ his favorite chair and simply stopped breathing.\n\nAfter his diagnosis, my dad\u2019\
  s greatest worry was that he would be a burden to us. I\u2019ll always wonder if\
  \ that thought was in his head, as he was fading out of this world. What if he gave\
  \ up his fight for me?\n\nA year has passed since he left and my life remains on\
  \ pause. Lately, my inner wanderer feels the pull to get back out and see the world.\
  \ Do I stay? Do I go? How do you honor the man who gave you everything; his dimples,\
  \ his patience, his strength, his life? \n\nYou live."
