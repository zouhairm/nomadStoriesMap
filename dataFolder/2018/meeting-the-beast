Text: "It was dark, cold, covered in snow, glowing in the moonlight, the most magnificent\
  \ and terrifying place I had ever seen -the Grand Canyon. \nI made a long trip to\
  \ come and see you, I thought, but you don't even give a damn. Of course it didn't,\
  \ millions of people were coming to it every year. What was so special about me?\
  \ I was trying my best to capture the ancient magic the place possessed, but did\
  \ not seem inclined to share it with anybody, me in particular.\nMuch later, after\
  \ days and weeks spent roaming the steep slopes, it occurred to me that the canyon\
  \ did speak, had spoken even on that first night, was willing share its secrets\
  \ with those ready to listen. It takes effort to learn its language, to understand\
  \ that there are words hidden in silence. I got to know the great beast of the great\
  \ America, it was frightening and severe, but beautiful in the most mesmerizing\
  \ way. Every step up and down its slopes felt like slipping between sharp teeth\
  \ of a large dragon, that had fallen asleep a millennia ago.\nA few hours after\
  \ meeting the ferocious beast of the wild a moment came to see the dragon of the\
  \ civilized world, lying in the desert, surrounded by the graying mountains. It\
  \ seemed completely different from the silent canyon, Las Vegas they called it.\
  \ \nYou are such a fake, I told it. It must have found the words offensive for that\
  \ same day somebody stole my wallet. Perhaps the city was teaching me a lesson.\
  \ \"watch your mouth, woman, have resect, it seemed to be saying, I have sharp teeth\
  \ too, even sharper than those of the sleeping dragon\"\nThis was such a different\
  \ world. Being there felt like flying across half of the universe at light speed\
  \ and ending up on a different planet. I was in the US, but also in Paris, Rome\
  \ and Venice at the same time, everywhere and nowhere in particular, I was in Las\
  \ Vegas. It was buzzing, howling, whistling around me, so different from the vast,\
  \ cold canyon I had just abandoned.\nIt struck me suddenly: there was a voice heard\
  \ behind the silence of the canyon, one had to listen to hear but it had been there.\
  \ There was nothing beneath the conundrum of the city. When you let all the yelling,\
  \ screeching and shouting subside, tried to move past it, look into something deeper\
  \ that might have been lurking under the surface there was nothing to be found,\
  \ heard or learned. \nThe last thing I expected was to find so much emptiness and\
  \ silence in the middle of a crowd when the desolate, abandoned land had beed filled\
  \ with life."
