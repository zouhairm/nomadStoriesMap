Text: "It was rainy evening when my airplane landed after circling around Tokyo bay.\
  \ When I first entered the building of Haneda International Airport I\u2019ve spotted\
  \ one of the personnel conducting the military saluting to all of passengers.  They\
  \ say you should be ready and expect everything when you are travelling abroad.\
  \  But it is easier to say than do in practice.  This is particularly true when\
  \ you are travelling to Japan. I originally arrived in Japan knowing almost nothing\
  \ (except konnichiwa), with no real interest in the country and culture. By the\
  \ end of my six month contact I had fallen in love and didn't want to leave!  I\
  \ experienced events every day that made me smile, laugh, or think is this possible...\
  \ in fact, even after leaving I still learn more that keep the country and people\
  \ in a special place in my heart. There are amazing contrasts throughout the country,\
  \ technology right alongside simplicity - a temple priest riding a bike in his traditional\
  \ robes while chatting on the latest word of technology.  Trains running on time,\
  \ steel mills, oil refineries and crowded cities, even people who wash out their\
  \ soda bottles and peel off the labels before they put them in the recycling \u2013\
  \ I saw all of these things and even more. But it is a special kind of a story with\
  \ homeless beggars which in Japan don\u2019t deserve to be called so. The main reason\
  \ is that they are not begging for money or food at all. I\u2019ve gained an impression\
  \ they are living in a parallel world. Under the highways, pedestrian bridges and\
  \ in the shopping quarters, they live like in murky seaweed. Seen only in a certain\
  \ period of the night when everything is closed. During the day are visible only\
  \ the mountaineering tents or bigger cardboard boxes which are they using for sleeping\
  \ place.  Sidelined and for many invisible. The most of them are middle aged man.\
  \ All of them silently struggling. When you look them in the face, as if you can\
  \ read it \u2013 there\u2019s nothing. I was stunned by this scene. Particularly\
  \ because of my origin country which is not a high income economy and where beggars\
  \ are at every step asking people to give them money. In the past more rich people\
  \ than this one today, left numerous endowments. Nowadays there left not so many\
  \ enlightened, they all huddled.  In the end, I remembered an old Serbian saying\
  \ \u2013 Ours only what we give as present to others. In that moment one of them\
  \ covered himself with blanket and closed his eyes \u2013 for many of us a breathtaking\
  \ moment."
