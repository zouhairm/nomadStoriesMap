Text: "Obama  was a nicotine addicted professional road rally racer from Merzuga.\
  \ He was but an itty bit of a Berber man with a Buddha belly and an infectious laugh.\
  \  Although he claimed proficiency in English, our communication was more of an\
  \ amalgamation of bits of five languages and a heavy dose of pantomime.  I think\
  \ he gave us Berber names because he couldn\u2019t pronounce our English ones. I\
  \ became \u201CFatima\u201D and my husband \u201CAli Baba\u201D.  He  became \u201C\
  Obama Magnifique\u201D because of his frequent exclamations: \u201CC\u2019est Magnifique\u201D\
  \ was the refrain within each conversation.  \nDespite his four-wheel driving machine\
  \ and love of speed, our drive through a rare snow storm proceeded at no more than\
  \ 20 kilometers an hour.  Consternation was evident in his focused, white knuckled\
  \ approach.  When the snow turned to rain, relief was evident in the return of his\
  \ jovial manner.  There was a definite inverse relationship between his relief and\
  \ our growing uncertainty with the increased speed of our decent to the valley below.\
  \   In a memory etched in slow motion, as we rounded a corner, Obama made efforts\
  \ to avoid an unexpected van.  All movement stopped with the sound of the crash,\
  \ followed by Obama\u2019s expletive  and an eruption of wild gesticulations and\
  \ loud yelling.  Slowly, reminiscent of a clown car, 15 or so Berbers piled out\
  \ of the van to add their commentary.  Wearing fleece bathrobes for warmth, angry\
  \ suspicious expressions met my tentative smiles. Hands in pocket to manage the\
  \ chill, I found the tin of cinnamon Altoids.  Tin in hand and starting with a softer\
  \ appearing woman, I opened the box.  She gingerly accepted my offering and with\
  \ wide eyed astonishment expressed her approval.  Soon there was a line of Berbers\
  \ in front of me.  Some popped mints immediately into their mouths, others sniffed\
  \ before sampling and a few tucked the small lozenges into pockets for later consumption.\
  \  Obama's relief was palpable with police assisted resolution  and the eventual\
  \ repair of his beloved SUV.   We continued our journey with greater affection for\
  \ each other.   As our time with Obama came to a close, so did our laughing relationship.\
  \  Despite efforts to remain ever affable, his tears spoke the truth for him and\
  \ for us as we approached the airport. .  For the last six years Obama has occasionally\
  \ called to chat and we do, as best we can. They are conversations about children\
  \ and cars in a language we have grown to love, one cobbled together and bound by\
  \ a shared history."
