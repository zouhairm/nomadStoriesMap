Text: "Follow your dreams, I've been told, that's what I decided. In a flash, I saw\
  \ myself, walking with quite a big bag, under a blue sky. That's what I saw, and\
  \ my brain interpreted it very quickly\_: I was meant to visit New-Zealand. Speechless\
  \ when I arrived in Auckland after two days in the sky, I expected to see waterfalls,\
  \ but not that fast. Rain, this four letter word that joined me during the most\
  \ part of my trip.\nI could easily walk you throught all my adventures, but as much\
  \ as I enjoy your attention reader, I must spare your eyes. Certainly, even if there's\
  \ some kind of routine going on after a while, you do see something new very often.\
  \ On the top of that, I come from a project near Paris, meaning that my routine\
  \ back then was filled with concrete towers and grey sky, not very appealing, n'est-ce\
  \ pas\_?\nI could talk to you about that guy who found me walking, secretly starving\
  \ and took upon himself to find me some food and a shelter for the night. I could\
  \ tell you about that night when I was attacked by a possum who was attracted by\
  \ the curry smell on my hands after I had some rice. I could talk to you about how\
  \ fantastic and free I felt every morning when I woke up in my tent, even under\
  \ a pouring rain. I could talk to you about those rivers that offered me a freezing\
  \ bath in the mornings I decided to wash myself a bit. I could talk to you about\
  \ that night I met two french guys, and how we spent the night talking to each other\
  \ about mangas and other stuff we're into. I could talk to you about when I conquered\
  \ the north island after a fourteen hours walk. It might sound impressive to you,\
  \ reader, but what if I told you that none of this has any relevance to me now\_\
  ? Because the last thing I expected, while travelling with loneliness, was to meet\
  \ her. \nShe arrived in my life when I decided to stop hiking. My pockets full of\
  \ air, I went back to Auckland. Probably the less exciting place in New-Zealand,\
  \ but it was the theater of our romance. During my hiking I got a lot of time on\
  \ my hands. I questionned myself about why I went away. \xAB\_I think, therefore\
  \ I am\_\xBB, said Descartes. I ended up convicing myself that my motto was more\
  \ likely to be \xAB\_I walk, therefore I flee\_\xBB\_ It's all a matter of perspective\
  \ really. Some will argue that the glass is half-full, others will say half-empty,\
  \ while really it is just full, but with water and air. Now, I know I wasn't completely\
  \ wrong, because all that time I might have been fleeing, but I was still going\
  \ towards you."
