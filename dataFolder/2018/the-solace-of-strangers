Text: "Hurrying past selfie-taking tourists, Sandro leads me down cobbled lanes away\
  \ from the city centre. I exhale a sigh of relief and savour the nocturnal breeze\
  \ that envelops my body in a cool embrace. Old men with leathery skin sit outside\
  \ animatedly talking to cigar-smoking friends. Enamoured couples zoom by on motorini\
  \ as waiters emerge briskly from caf\xE9s, carrying trays with dinky espresso cups.\
  \ \u201CThis is the time of day when locals come out again\u201D, Sandro whispers\
  \ in his velvety tone, lilting vowels rendered with Italian musicality.\n\nMy journey\
  \ over here hadn\u2019t been as idyllic. In Heathrow Airport I had to switch off\
  \ my phone to avoid my father\u2019s aggressive phone calls. He was still furious\
  \ after finding out that I wasn\u2019t going to finish my business degree and that\
  \ I had no intention of taking over the family business. Unsure of what to do with\
  \ myself, I booked a flight to Florence. I encountered Sandro, a twinkly eyed, cheerful\
  \ waiter on my first night here.\n\nWe soon find ourselves in the wide, tree lined\
  \ square that is Piazza Santo Spirito, replete with Florentines, young and old,\
  \ whose Saturday ritual involves coming here after their passeggiata. Hands are\
  \ thrown up towards heaven, pinched fingers draw invisible lines while palms, pressed\
  \ together, are thrusted forward and back, all for semantic purpose. This is a nation\
  \ that converses just as loudly with its hands as with its tongue.\nAt one table\
  \ I spy four generations of a family sitting at the one table, twirling linguini\
  \ around their forks and sipping the house red, completely unaware of the feat they\u2019\
  ve accomplished. The nonna wipes tomato sauce off her infant grandson\u2019s chin\
  \ while the girlfriend of the teenage son laughs in amusement. This is the sort\
  \ of thing that would require a year\u2019s planning at home.\n\nAided by a lively\
  \ folk band, the centre of the piazza is magically transformed into a makeshift\
  \ dance floor. Strangers grasp my hands as we dance together in a circle, hitching\
  \ our skirts up and clicking our heels, laughing like old friends. \n\n\u201CSo\
  \ what\u2019s your secret?\u201D I ask Sandro, nodding towards the merry dancers\
  \ before me. \u201CThere is no secret. We work hard but we relax on Saturday night.\
  \ So what if the economy is just\u2026\u201D he scrambles around looking for the\
  \ right word- \u201Cterribile- we don\u2019t care. We have our health, our family,\
  \ friends\u2026 and vino buono,\u201D he smirks, raising his glass. \u201CWhat more\
  \ do we need?\u201D\nMaybe coming here to figure out what to do with my life wasn\u2019\
  t such a bad idea after all."
