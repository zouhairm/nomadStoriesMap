Text: "My bike\u2019s needle was long past E when I finally sputtered into Tinglayan.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t a very impressive village \u2013 just a haphazard grouping of wooden\
  \ hovels topped with sheet metal \u2013 but to me it rang of salvation.\n\n\u201C\
  Gas?\u201D I asked three kids playing on the road.\n\n\u201CInang,\u201D they answered,\
  \ and pointed to a shack.\n\nI rolled there in neutral and eased off the saddle.\
  \ I wiped the gravelly mountain dust from my eyes, took off my helmet, and discovered\
  \ that the shack was actually a shop. Packets of soap and shampoo in condom-like\
  \ wrappers hung from the ceiling, brightly colored candy lay on a makeshift counter,\
  \ and lo and behold, green Coca Cola bottles lined the road. \n\nGas.\n\nInang sold\
  \ them to me for twice the going rate, but I didn\u2019t care. Gasoline had never\
  \ smelled so sweet. She smiled at me with a wrinkly, toothless grin as I filled\
  \ up my empty tank, and then patted a small wicker stool next to hers when I was\
  \ done. Grateful, I sat down and stretched my legs.\n\n\u201CCoffee?\u201D she asked.\n\
  \nMy face must have lit up with joy, because she didn\u2019t wait for my reply.\
  \ She took out a big, beat up Thermos, and poured me a cup. \n\n\u201CDelicious,\u201D\
  \ I said. It was deathly sweet, but any liquid was honey to my throat. \n\n\u201C\
  My hijo also like motos,\u201D she said, nodding towards my bike, \u201CWhere you\
  \ from?\u201D\n\n\u201CRussia,\u201D I pointed to the flag on my jacket. \n\n\u201C\
  No, no. Where you from?\u201D she asked again, and mimicked driving the motorcycle.\n\
  \n\u201COh. Manila. Then up the coast to Laoag, across to Tuguegarao, and up through\
  \ Tabuk.\u201D\n\nShe nodded distractedly.\n\n\u201CManila. My hijo is in Manila,\u201D\
  \ she said.\n\n\u201CYour son? What does he do?\u201D\n\n\u201CHe go, fifteen, twenty\
  \ years. Long time.\u201D\n\n\u201COh.\u201D\n\nWith nothing to answer to that,\
  \ I looked around and noticed that the kids had followed me down, and were pointing\
  \ and laughing from a distance. Two wore straw conical hats, and none had shoes.\
  \ I waved. They ran away hooting.\n\n\u201CHe dead there,\u201D said Inang after\
  \ a long pause.\n\n\u201CWhat?\u201D\n\n\u201CHe never come back. Dead, I think.\u201D\
  \n\nAnother pause.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m sorry.\u201D\n\n\u201CLong time ago,\u201D\
  \ she shook her head, \u201CMore coffee?\u201D\n\nWe didn\u2019t talk after that.\
  \ We just sat there, out of the sun, and sipped coffee in silence, until I went\
  \ back on my way, hoping to make good time before the sun went down. I had places\
  \ to go and discover. \n\nInang?\n\nShe was content with waiting, I think. Waiting\
  \ for time to pass by. For someone to share some coffee with. And sometimes, maybe,\
  \ for something to remind her of her son."
