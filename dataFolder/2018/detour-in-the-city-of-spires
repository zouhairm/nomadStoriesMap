Text: "There\u2019s a saying that preparation is the key to success, but when you\u2019\
  re on your fourth pint of Guinness at the Merry Ploughboy Pub, and your new best\
  \ friend from Calgary asks if you want to go to Prague tomorrow \u2014 carpe diem!\n\
  Out came the Visa, and before we managed to leave the bar, I purchased the last\
  \ ticket on Ryanair flight FR7326 from Dublin to Prague, and booked an adorable\
  \ Airbnb along the Vltava River. With a hop in our step (and a slight pound in our\
  \ heads), we jetted off to Czech Republic \u2014 a country we knew nothing about.\n\
  It was glorious. The mid-July sun was a welcome change from the drizzle we experienced\
  \ in Ireland, and our airport taxi driver blasted Avicii\u2019s anthem 'Levels'\
  \ while we flipped through brochures of the river cruises and quaint restaurants\
  \ that awaited us \u2014 until suddenly \u2014 he took a sharp right turn. \nHe\
  \ drove across an overpass and down into an area of the city that looked like no\
  \ place for two young Canadian girls. There were no cars or people around, and the\
  \ ancient narrow buildings \u2014 once painted bright yellow and white \u2014 were\
  \ covered in graffiti and thick films of dirt.\nDread consumed us. Not only were\
  \ we in an Eastern European country synonymous with human trafficking and political\
  \ corruption, we didn\u2019t speak the language or have any local currency.\nOur\
  \ driver pulled up next to a rundown hostel and threw our bags out onto the sidewalk.\
  \ He motioned us to get out of the car.\nCautiously, we stepped out onto the empty\
  \ street, and tried to explain to him that we booked accommodations across from\
  \ the John Lennon Wall. He was adamant, through his broken English, that we were\
  \ at the correct place.\nMy friend shot me a sideways look and switched the data\
  \ on her phone from \u201Coff\u201D to \u201Con.\" She thumbed through until she\
  \ found the number for our Airbnb host, and made one very expensive international\
  \ call. \nThe driver had the wrong address. \nHe grumbled something in Czech, tossed\
  \ our bags back into the car and sped down the road before we could even get our\
  \ seat-belts re-fastened. \nJust as quickly as he diverted us into the slums, he\
  \ turned a corner into a fairy-tale land of cobblestone streets and Gothic buildings.\n\
  The rest of our trip offered a much different story of Prague. Known as \u201Cthe\
  \ city of a hundred spires,\u201Dnever have I seen a place with such beautiful architecture\
  \ \u2014 like the set of a Disney movie \u2014 and so alive with people, both day\
  \ and night. \nThough her underbelly is rough, the tourist haven of Old Town Prague\
  \ is magic."
