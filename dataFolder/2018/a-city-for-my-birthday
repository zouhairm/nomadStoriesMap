Text: "When you read about New York City they never tell you about the garbage piles.\
  \ They\u2019re everywhere, on every street corner, in the alleyways, clogging up\
  \ all of my photos. It is hard for me to reconcile the glamorous New York ideal\
  \ that I have come here to find, with all of this trash.\n\nMy new friends assure\
  \ me that you get used to it. They have been proud New Yorkers for ten years so\
  \ they know what they\u2019re talking about. They moved to the city while in their\
  \ twenties to chase dreams of working in the theatre. Until meeting me they have\
  \ not met anyone else from our shared hometown, Edmonton Canada, so far in their\
  \ time here. We bonded quickly over this coincidence, laughing about shared favourite\
  \ restaurants and landmarks. \n\nThey\u2019ve taken me here, on a wild detour from\
  \ our original UberPool destination of Bushwick, because I will be turning twenty-two\
  \ in ten minutes. \u201CA birthday surprise,\u201D the woman assures me as her husband\
  \ pays the uber driver off, in cash, to wait for us. We climb out of the car and\
  \ they lead me by the hand down a side street. We turn a corner and I am dumbfounded.\
  \ We\u2019re standing on the bank of the Hudson River, with all of Manhattan stretched\
  \ out before us. These strangers have, as much as possible, given me their city\
  \ as a birthday gift. \n\n\u201CI wanted you to see it like we do,\u201D the woman\
  \ says. At this moment I do. \n\nWe stand together and gaze at the lights of the\
  \ city. The man puts his arm around his wife, she puts her arm around me. The man\
  \ holds out his phone so that we can see the exact moment that I become a year older.\
  \ It is only us, and the Manhattan skyline. Us and a million lights stretched out\
  \ in both directions as far as the eye can see. \n\nI turn twenty-two secure in\
  \ the knowledge that we are just as small as any of those lights. I do not think\
  \ about the garbage piles. I think about people like this couple; people who have\
  \ come here from a place to familiar to me to carve out a piece of the American\
  \ Dream. I think about the fact that the New York that I have come to find: the\
  \ artist\u2019s haven, the poet\u2019s dream, the place where anything is possible,\
  \ doesn\u2019t exist. It can\u2019t. That fantasy isn\u2019t what makes New York\
  \ City special. It\u2019s her people, their stories, and the dreams that brought\
  \ them here, to populate these garbage ridden streets. They don\u2019t come to New\
  \ York for what the city is. They come here for the far-reaching possibility of\
  \ what she could be. For them, that is enough, and right now it is also enough for\
  \ me."
