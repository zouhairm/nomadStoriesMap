Text: "As the sun dipped, and rays of milky light melted into the ocean spray, Edgar\
  \ planted his feet on his board for another ride. A sanguine character, he had found\
  \ his redemption among the hallowed waves of El Salvador\u2019s Costa del Balsamo.\
  \ Speaking with him in a caf\xE9 earlier that day, he was forthright and honest\
  \ about the perils of his past, and the refuge that lay on this coastline. Gang\
  \ culture eats away at the soul of this otherwise tranquil nation, and the spectre\
  \ of violence still hangs over the country like the muggy summer air following the\
  \ disastrous civil war which ended in 1992. Edgar had resisted gang enrolment, but\
  \ some of his friends had not found the same good fortune. The desire for a sense\
  \ of identity was too strong to deny. With an estimated half a million Salvadoran\
  \ citizens associated with gangs in some form, and children as young as seven recruited\
  \ into the strata, escape for many youths starts to look less like luck, and more\
  \ like a miracle. \nEdgar told me that surfing had saved him. It gave life meaning,\
  \ smoothed hard corners and provided sanctuary from the trials of the past. He epitomised\
  \ the positivity and tenacity of the local population, never shy of providing a\
  \ smile or a friendly word. And his surfing was exceptional. On this day, I was\
  \ sitting on my board in the channel, away from the breaking waves. Shards of willowy\
  \ sea spray were drifting onto my cracked lips as the sun turned a bold late-day\
  \ orange. Further up the point, waves peeled tantalisingly onto the shallow rock\
  \ shelf, but they weren\u2019t fierce; indeed, they seemed as nonchalant as the\
  \ palm trees swaying in the hills above. And that\u2019s when I saw Edgar rise to\
  \ his feet again.\nHe set a course and began to weave arcing, graceful turns up\
  \ and down the wave face like a progressive artist\u2019s paint strokes on canvas.\
  \ His childhood rose to the forefront of my mind in this moment; the threats, the\
  \ constant fear, and the strength to resist as his friends melted into the void.\
  \ I was still watching as he turned smoothly off the top of the wave; his style\
  \ languid, refined. He ended his ride nearby and gave a little hoot and a smile.\
  \ As we paddled back up towards the point together, his oneness with this patch\
  \ of earth suddenly felt overwhelming, and I began to see it for more than what\
  \ it appeared on the surface. The desire to belong was strong here, and caused many\
  \ to choose the dangerous path. But Edgar had found his sense of belonging elsewhere,\
  \ and it was purifying to witness."
