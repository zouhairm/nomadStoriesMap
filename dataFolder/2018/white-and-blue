Text: "\u201CNo, I don't think i can do it\u201D. \n\u201CYes, you can\u201D. I didn't\
  \ believe in what he was telling me but, still, there was a voice inside me, like\
  \ a whisper. \u201CJust sign up, you'll then realize if you feel like going\u201D\
  .\nAnd that's exactly what happened.  I signed up on a list of people, the brave\
  \ (or crazy) ones who wanted to go on a two day hike to the highest hut in Europe,\
  \ Capanna Regina Margherita, 4554 meters high. After a few minutes I promised myself\
  \ I would try. \nIt was running in my blood, like a promise if you think about it.\
  \ Fisrt of all, the name in itself is a promise. In the memory of an Italian girl\
  \ like me, a \u201Ccapanna\u201D- that's the Italian word for hut - recalls the\
  \ name of the indian little house she played with when she was four and the name\
  \ of an house made of wood and built on a tree where, again, she used to play in\
  \ when she was four. At the same time, Regina Margherita, the queen the place was\
  \ named after, had the same name of the queen that same girl pretended she was,\
  \ when she was four, a child playing in the back yard on a little house built on\
  \ a tree. And last but not least, the place was built to conduct research activities\
  \ and that was the job that little girl choose when she became an adult.\nIn order\
  \ to keep that promise I didn't even know my blood made for me, when they called\
  \ me back to say there was a spot ready for me on the group I just picked my white\
  \ shirt and my blue pants and left. \nWe met in Gressoney, five people and a mountain\
  \ guide with an open smile on his face. He just told us \u201Clet's go, don't think\
  \ about anything but your steps\u201D. I trusted his smile and his peace even more\
  \ than the knowledge he had of his favourite mountains, the ones we were about to\
  \ climb. I trusted the atmosphere of the night before in the hut you sleep at before\
  \ the final climb, a bunch of strangers together talking like old friends. I trusted\
  \ my feet and the feeling hiking the mountains gives me, perfection and beauty inside\
  \ and outside. \nAt 4 am I woke up and just started my hike, step after step. And\
  \ at each step, the light became clearer and clearer, the air lighter and lighter,\
  \ our souls brighter and brighter. My mind was even clearer and overwhelmed with\
  \ even brighter thougths, white and blue like the snow and the sky and essential\
  \ like the ones of a four year old girl, playing and  pretending she is a queen\
  \ on a little indian house built on a tree."
