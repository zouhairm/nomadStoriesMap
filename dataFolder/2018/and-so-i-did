Text: "Day after day ordinary people do ordinary things in ordinary clothes living\
  \ ordinary lives, never pushing limits or exceeding beyond a standard of living\
  \ deemed acceptable by society. What even is society. Well technically speaking,\
  \ it\u2019s the aggregate of people living together in a more or less ordered community.\
  \ But really it\u2019s these norms we\u2019ve put in place that we consider to be\
  \ the right or of orderly way. I think I always knew I didn\u2019t want to be an\
  \ ordinary person and that I didn\u2019t want to accept ordinary mannerisms. People\
  \ go to work they come home go to sleep then they do it all over again . Constantly\
  \ moving. Quickly pushing through a hectic station to catch your morning commute\
  \ . Quickly trying to make it to the shops before closing  to get the milk you were\
  \ reminded twice about. Accelerating quickly to get away before the light turns\
  \ red, all for what ? \nWhen do we ever stop, observe , listen , smell , think ?\
  \ It\u2019s so very ignorant really to let time pass as though it\u2019s nothing\
  \ , to just accept a black and white world because what you see is what you get.\
  \ I spent the best of my time doing all these conventional behaviors and never really\
  \ noticed how quickly time does slip away. It was like a lightbulb moment for me\
  \ something I always thought about but never did anything about. As the saying goes\
  \ actions speak louder than words. Travel. You might say it was a decision that\
  \ pushed me to the edge , The edge of freedom maybe the edge of the world maybe\
  \ the edge of reality who knew I certainly didn\u2019t at the time. I wanted to\
  \ be more than content, I wanted to dream, I wanted to feel something other than\
  \ mere adequate existence and what I wanted more than anything what I longed for\
  \ more than anything else was to feel alive. So I decided to live. It was that click,\
  \ a snap moment, suddenly I couldn\u2019t believe that I\u2019d made it all so complex\
  \ trying to pinpoint what was missing when really it was myself that wasn\u2019\
  t there anymore. Myself that was waiting to be found. How naive of me. I had let\
  \ my life be dominated by a 9-5 that I had no interest in , controlled by the day\
  \ in day out normalities of work, home, sleep repeat. Don\u2019t get me wrong we\
  \ live in a world where we need to work to get by and that\u2019s absolutely fine\
  \ but to let something you don\u2019t care about consume you by mind and body and\
  \ soul is just not something I\u2019m willing to accept. I want to do more, I want\
  \ to be passionate , I want to help people and to help myself by helping people.\
  \ And so I did ."
