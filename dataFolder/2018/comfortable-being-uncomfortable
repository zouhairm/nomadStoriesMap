Text: "Unfamiliar words echoing and cigarette smoke sifting through every inch of\
  \ air around me was a starling welcome to a foreign land. The shock of meeting my\
  \ host mother for the first time was beyond overwhelming. I saw her notice the small,\
  \ silver cross hanging from the delicate chain around my neck and I desperately\
  \ wondered what she was thinking. With moments of re-acquaintance with my host student\
  \ and with the second tallest building in the country mounted over me like an adult\
  \ watching every move I made, I was somewhere outside of my comfort zone, somewhere\
  \ completely unfamiliar. \n\nI walked a few blocks, suitcase in hand, over the stone-covered\
  \ pathways, attempting to accustom myself to the dense accent of my host mother\
  \ and take in the new environment. With classic European architecture on either\
  \ side of the street and bicycles ringing past, it was evident that this land was\
  \ not Michigan. I had left my comfort zone and flown somewhere on the opposite side\
  \ of my everyday reality. As we approached a man standing in the center of our path,\
  \ I was introduced to my host father. Completely out of myself, possibly still overwhelmed\
  \ by the foreign atmosphere surrounding me, I gave my host-father a hug, only to\
  \ remember afterwards that Germans are more of the hand-shaking type of people.\
  \ Greetings were exchanged and we were soon on our way to what would be my home\
  \ for the next few weeks \u2013 a modern, three-bedroom apartment clustered among\
  \ rows of other relatively small abodes. Brick-layered, generously spaced homes\
  \ with large backyards were non-existent in my alter-comfort zone. These initial\
  \ moments on German soil were mere foreshadowing of what was to come. My outlook\
  \ on life would be greatly altered as I figured my way in an unfamiliar and often\
  \ uncomfortable reality.\n\nBeyond gaining knowledge on culture, language, and foreign-social\
  \ interactions, I learned how to gain something from every experience, awkward or\
  \ not. Adventure is exposure to new experiences, emphasis on appreciation of what\
  \ one has and a display of what else is out there. Journeys can strengthen what\
  \ one stands for while showing what others believe and why. It's also at the end\
  \ of a journey when one realizes how wonderful ordinary life is, regardless of living\
  \ outside of comfort. Outside of comfort is the best place to learn."
