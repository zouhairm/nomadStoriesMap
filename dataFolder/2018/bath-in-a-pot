Text: "Here we go... Last minutes of packing, time to go back home. I\u2019m breathing\
  \ in fresh Carpathian air for the last time and close the hotel door behind me.\
  \ And there\u2019s, as always, my green backpack on my shoulder. I affectionately\
  \ call it \u201CVoyager\u201D. Voyager is my go-to travel partner, for the last\
  \ few days we were seeking breathtaking adventures: swimming in the cold, chilling\
  \ to the bones, mountain stream, playing the longest musical instrument Trembita\
  \ (if you can call that horrible sound \u201Cplaying\u201D), enjoying the fascinating\
  \ views on the hills and so much more.\nIf you still wonder where Carpathians are,\
  \ I\u2019ll give you a hint \u2013 it\u2019s in the land of borsch, Cossacks and\
  \ beautiful women - Ukraine. And here, in Carpathian Mountains, is located the heart\
  \ of its cultural diversity.\n Time spent here is a kaleidoscope of memories, feelings\
  \ that are so perfectly mixed up: in chemistry, I guess, it would be called diffusion.\
  \ Despite the fact that I'm from Ukraine and it\u2019s my homeland, this trip to\
  \ Carpathians felt like a trip to another country. People here speak slightly different,\
  \ their language was affected by the influence of neighboring countries. You can\
  \ find here original traditions. So, to prove the locals I\u2019m to be taken seriously,\
  \ I had to try the one I call \u201CBath in a pot\u201D.\nIt is the largest pot\
  \ I\u2019ve ever seen. Fits 6 people. The water is slowly rising to 42\xB0C . \n\
  I had a pleasure to take,maybe, the largest spoon in the world, and mix the water\
  \ in a pot. In that moment I felt like the Wicked Witch from Enchanted forest who\u2019\
  s gonna make one hell of a delicious soup from these people for dinner. But then\
  \ I had to try this entertainment from another side. So, the next moment I sit in\
  \ a pot and feel like my blood is boiling. Next step of procedure leads to a mountain\
  \ stream. Water temperature there is no more than 5\xB0C. I think I\u2019m not ready\
  \ to jump there and I need more time to prepare. Well\u2026 Bullshit.  You can never\
  \ be ready for this. You just need to jump. Close your eyes and 3, 2, 1...   \n\
  The water is freezing, my body is shaking\u2026 But when I go out from the water,\
  \ it\u2019s the most wonderful feeling like I just was reborn. I left all my problems\
  \ and sorrows in the cold water and became a different person who\u2019s not afraid\
  \ to take the risk and who will jump into the stream 3 more times.  \n I proved\
  \ that sometimes you can find incredible experiences even within your homeland and\
  \ that you need to make a local connection even with the people from your own country."
