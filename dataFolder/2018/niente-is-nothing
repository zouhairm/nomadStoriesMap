Text: "Niente. Is nothing.\n\n I was warned about the children. Told many horror stories\
  \ about mobs of them, with grubby hands and knives pawing at your clothing; that\
  \ the kids would surround you from behind and start grabbing at your clothing, pick-pocketing\
  \ you or completely dicing off your pockets. I never got to see any of these supposed\
  \ horror stories.\n So when my friends and I were in Florence, Italy, seated on\
  \ a patio after dark, watching the Florentine night life wander by, droves of well-dressed\
  \ Italian teens, black leather and suede, yelling and laughing through the piazza,\
  \ and in the midst of all the wandering I saw a kid, probably 10 or 11, with a pathetic\
  \ look on his face walking up to various people with his hands cupped like a bowl\
  \ in front of him asking for money, I didn't think much of it-- or, better put,\
  \ I wasn't alarmed by it. I thought, cool, a gypsy kid! \n        He approached\
  \ us with this sad look on his face, lower-lip jutting out almost pouting, chanting\
  \ \u201Clire, lire, per favore, money, please, I'm hungry!\u201D He asked for the\
  \ time, not seeming to want to leave, and asked if we're Americans, this huge white\
  \ grin spreading on his dark, olive-brown face. Travis pulled out his video camera,\
  \ and the kid suddenly got incredibly animated, pantomiming he had something to\
  \ show us. Travis flipped out the 2 1/2 inch view screen and rotated it over so\
  \ the kid could see himself in front of the camera. And the kid began to dance.\
  \ \n He performed a little soft-shoe tap dance, clapping as he saw himself on the\
  \ screen. The kid, dressed in dark sweat pants, a red spring-jacket, and worn tennis\
  \ shoes, backed off from the camera, saying, \"aspettare, aspettare,\" wait! He\
  \ pulled off his coat and twirled it and threw it to the ground, proudly presenting\
  \ his white t-shirt with plaid lettering that read \"rock n' roll.\" He pointed\
  \ at the shirt and grinned at the camera, and then moon walked to the side, a quick\
  \ robot break dancing wave with his arms, and finished with a clap.    \n      \
  \   I hear all the stories of the \u201Cdirty gypsies,\u201D and I think of this\
  \ kid. I remember a story I read on why a lot of religious people pity the gypsies\
  \ for having no Book of their own. When God was handing out the different religions\
  \ the gypsies wrote theirs down on cabbage leaves, and soon the holy book became\
  \ a donkey's dinner. I think of this and I think about the kid, perhaps, clapping\
  \ at the story, and then shrugging, saying \u201Cniente, is nothing, no worries.\u201D\
  \ Yep. No worries."
