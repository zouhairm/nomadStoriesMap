Text: "So here I got this opportunity to fulfill my dream which I always wished for.\
  \ Visiting North was something which I always wanted to and the opportunity that\
  \ knocked my door and was waiting me to enter the most beautiful place. North was\
  \ just an about to be a marvelous experience for me. This was the last year of my\
  \ college life and I wouldn't have got an another opportunity apart from this to\
  \ convence my family and visit Manali, Amritsar, Dharamshala, Chandigarh, kasol.\
  \ North is like the Heart of India and especially such places are heartbeats. After\
  \ convincing so much I finally got the opportunity to go and then i was just waiting\
  \ for December so that I could just escape from here. Me and my friends reached\
  \ the station and soon our train was about to leave. From here the real journey\
  \ began of my life. Going alone with few of my friends with whom I was not that\
  \ close and no family members was the first time this was happening with me. As\
  \ the journey began our train traveling was super fun, where we got all excited\
  \ when we saw \"sarsoon ke khet\" as we saw it only in movies and now we were actually\
  \ here. After 36 hrs of traveling we finally reached Amritsar. In Amritsar we visited\
  \ wagha border in the afternoon where there was a blast, young girls were dancing\
  \ screaming \"India India\" and so do we, pure feeling of patriotism. Then in the\
  \ evening we visited Golden temple which was heavenly beautiful where you can just\
  \ sit and feel all the positivity around you. After that we left for dharamshala\
  \ and when I was about to enter dharamshala what I saw was the beautiful snowy mountains\
  \ which were so far from me yet felt so close to my heart. Dharamshala was beautiful.\
  \ My marjoly favorite place was about to arrive which was Manali. It was -10\u2103\
  \ when we reached at 5 in the morning, I could still remember. We had so much fun\
  \ in our rooms each day. Visiting solang valley and witnessing those mountains straight\
  \ in front of me, touching the snow and playing with it was so much fun. Leaving\
  \ from manali with heavy heart was not that easy. The journey was more beautiful\
  \ then the destination itself and I was in love with traveling. Kasol had it's own\
  \ beauty and Chandigarh was so beautiful. It was out last destination and then we\
  \ headed back to Mumbai. Those friends had become close to me. I swear I had some\
  \ different energy in me and that's the reason I could make up for this trip. I\
  \ would love to visit north again. It was the most beautiful and memorable experience\
  \ of my life."
