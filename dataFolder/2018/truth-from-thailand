Text: "When most Westerners think of Thailand, negative images might come to mind.\
  \ When I planned on studying in Bangkok for a year, some of the comments I got were,\
  \ \u201CTake some pictures with the lady boys!\u201D, but mostly, \u201CWow- be\
  \ CAREFUL\u201D with some wide eyes in accompaniment. After originally planning\
  \ to stay one semester, I extended my stay for another semester after falling in\
  \ love with the culture of the land of smiles. I am constantly asked by Thai people\
  \ why I decided to come to Thailand- for most \u2018farang\u2019 (foreigners), it\
  \ is for party and nightlife. But, I have always been genuinely interested in Thailand\u2019\
  s unique food, culture, and nationalism. The degree of trust and emphasis on relationships\
  \ has made me question how to be a better person to others in my everyday life.\
  \ After my time there, I learned the importance of friends in one\u2019s life in\
  \ a way that I did not before, and can understand why Thai people are so shy when\
  \ meeting someone for the first time- they put a great emphasis on trust and getting\
  \ to know someone and often friends put each other at a greater value. In Thai culture,\
  \ people put great emphasis on trusting and knowing someone before telling them\
  \ their true feelings. This can be both a good and bad thing, as it can lead to\
  \ people being very shy and maybe not being completely honest, but also leading\
  \ to friends who you know will always care about you. But, even if you are a stranger,\
  \ most people will always be helpful and kind to you (I find much more than at home).\
  \ My Thai friend Sap\u2019s brother owns a music studio, and I have performed at\
  \ his open mic a couple of times and we always help each other out; if he needs\
  \ a performer at one of his gigs, I can help. One time he had other engagements,\
  \ but took me to the hospital when I had no one else to turn to. When I expressed\
  \ my gratitude for him dropping me off at the airport when I left, he said, \"Of\
  \ course: you are my friend\". My friend Metta is nice to everyone even if they\
  \ might not always deserve it; even the farang who are offensive to Thai culture\
  \ without realizing it. I learned how to trust others, how to trust myself, and\
  \ the universe by putting positive energy from the inside outwards; you cannot change\
  \ the world around you until you manifest light in yourself first and foremost.\
  \ I think this is essential, this ability to fit in anywhere and be able to talk\
  \ to other people without being ignorant or self-conscious, and find the inner connection,\
  \ adaptability, and similarities of life."
