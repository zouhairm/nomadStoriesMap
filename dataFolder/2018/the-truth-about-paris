Text: "I had never ever wanted to visit France, especially I never was a big fan of\
  \ Paris, yet this was the very first city that I fell in love with, you know how\
  \ they say \"from hate to love is a single step\".\n  Eiffel Tower? Louvre? I have\
  \ never experienced something more boring than this. This is already a cliche that\
  \ exhausted me.\n  If you really want to get inside the country you are visiting\
  \ you have to walk among people of this country, enlist this is how I got the chance\
  \ to see Paris from another point of view. Of course, I got lost, but I will definitely\
  \ do it all over again. \n  At first, I panicked, but then I realized that I will\
  \ never ever get this opportunity of exploring the city from the inside. I was walking\
  \ on the roads I had never walked before, even in Google Maps, I checked. \n  Everything\
  \ has a romantic note there, every stone in the building has its own color, which\
  \ makes those buildings unique pices of art. Speaking of art, beside Musee du Louvre\
  \ there is Musee d`Orsay, which has a very interesting history. Did you know that\
  \ this museum once was a train station? Or that the first piece of art which was\
  \ presented for the exhibition in 1986 was the museum itself? No worries, I did\
  \ not know this too, until I spoke to the guardian of this edifice during my little\
  \ adventure. Well, after some time walking around beautiful places, I saw a park.\
  \ It was very green and full of people, but still, it was quiet. All the trees,\
  \ not just in the park, were cut in a certain square shape. Have you ever seen things\
  \ like these? \n Like a normal human being, I got hungry. Fortunately, I had some\
  \ money in my pocket, so I got into a very simple coffee shop, which was a real\
  \ basic Parisian local, with all this romantic surrounding style and I got the chance\
  \ to try my French-speaking skills, you know what? It worked. Did you know what\
  \ Parisian citizens think about the situation when you pay more than it is indicated\
  \ on the bill? They think that money is theirs. So, when you will be in Paris, please\
  \ make sure you do not overpay, enlist you do not want to say bye-bye to your money\
  \ or you really want to thank them for hospitality and service. \n In conclusion,\
  \ we can see that Paris is not a city only for lovers. It is a city for everyone\
  \ who is attracted to some exceptional beauty, to the feeling of falling in love\
  \ or to good coffee with croissants. Do not be afraid to talk to people even though\
  \ you do not know French, try it.\nDare to visit Paris. Dare to fall in love"
