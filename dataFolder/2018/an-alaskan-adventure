Text: "WWOOF \u2013 it\u2019s not the sound of a dog barking, but the acronym for\
  \ a working holiday that more long-term travelers are turning to as they look for\
  \ cheap ways to continue their adventures abroad.\n\nWorld Wide Opportunities on\
  \ Organic Farms is a website that matches farmers with willing workers. The farmers\
  \ receive free help around their property, while the \u201Cwoofers\u201D get a free\
  \ bed and meals (usually healthy organic food), a unique experience, and a primer\
  \ in small-scale organic farming practices. You meet the locals and learn about\
  \ the local area far better than you can by staying in hotels and doing package\
  \ tours. \n\nI decided to give woofing a go up in Alaska. The first place was a\
  \ totally \u201Coff grid\u201D farm, several hours out of Anchorage which is the\
  \ largest city in Alaska. Electricity was provided by solar panels and a generator,\
  \ while water had to be hauled from a nearby natural spring. They had about 25 goats\
  \ (many of which were milked twice a day), 4 sheep, 1 pig, about 90 chickens, 5\
  \ turkeys, 3 old Alaskan Husky sled dogs and an organic vegetable garden. \nWhile\
  \ the rustic setting was attractive, the ultra-basic facilities were the things\
  \ that made me leave in the end. I was housed in a log cabin about a mile away from\
  \ the owners\u2019 cabin, and it was certainly an authentic place to be staying.\
  \ After a few weeks I should be exploring more of this amazing state so I said farewell,\
  \ though not before my hosts took me on a ride in their bush plane across the Chugach\
  \ mountain range and over the sparkling blue Prince William Sound. \n\nThe next\
  \ woofing destination was with a couple who owned both a small 2.5 acre farm in\
  \ the city of Anchorage itself, as well as a 20 acre farm in Homer, a beautiful\
  \ town on the sea about four hours away. Bill and Judy were unbelievably good to\
  \ me, and really helped me enjoy my time in Alaska. They were very interesting people,\
  \ being ex-hippies while Bill was a Vietnam veteran and an outspoken anti-war and\
  \ Green Party spokesman. \n\nThe usual woofing guideline is that a woofer will work\
  \ for about 25 hours a week in return for food and accommodation. However Bill and\
  \ Judy certainly didn\u2019t make me work that long, and they also provided amazing\
  \ Alaskan meals every night, including locally caught King Salmon that would be\
  \ worth at least $50 a plate at a restaurant in my native Australia. \n\nFor more\
  \ information, go to the main woofing website: www.wwoof.org and click on the geographical\
  \ area you want to travel in. Let the adventure begin!"
