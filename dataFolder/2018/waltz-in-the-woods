Text: "I have needs. I don\u2019t consider myself high maintenance, but here\u2019\
  s the thing: The door has shut, footsteps have receded in hollow percussion down\
  \ the hall punctuated by the metallic clang of the stairwell door. The welcome committee\
  \ departed -- I am alone. \n \nMy new home is this 10 by 20 foot cinder block space.\
  \ The room is iconic government minimalist decor: a bed, a chair, a table, a teakettle,\
  \ a cup, a towel, a pair of \u201Ccold feet, no good,\u201D plastic slide-on sandals.\
  \ This is faculty housing for teachers of English at the Daqing Foreign Language\
  \ High School. I must breach the gates that surround this fortress of higher education\
  \ and find what I need. A mirror. Hangers. A squeegee to rein in the flood water\
  \ of my shower.\n\nDaqing, this \u201Csmall\u201D northern city in China of 2.9\
  \ million, emerged from the wetland hunting grounds of the Mongolian D\xF6rbet Oirat\
  \ tribes when oil was discovered in 1959. Once robust shopping malls stand in hollow\
  \ testament of bygone petroleum-based affluence. Past H&M and KFC, beyond local\
  \ liquor and roast duck, lies the \u201Cnegative level\u201D wherein, a clerk told\
  \ my translation app, I\u2019d find the what I was looking for. \n\nNegative level\
  \ shopping is a subterranean warren of white tile aisleways arranged in subtle orchestration\
  \ of domestic need: fish tanks follow meat counters that intersperse then give way\
  \ to crates of bok choy and napa cabbage. Pyramids of bright mandarins and magenta\
  \ dragon fruit crescendo then gradually fade. Visual delight yields to aromatic\
  \ as ground chiles tickle my nose.\n\nBack beyond the gastronomic fare stands a\
  \ man amid his ensemble of mercantile. House dresses, razor blades, bras, an orange\
  \ inflatable swim ring, and electric hot water bottles dressed as superhero forest\
  \ animals taken from the Island of Misfit toys cover the floor and line the walls.\
  \  His stature is slight. A royal blue shop jacket with pens tuck neatly in the\
  \ left breast pocket, his proud uniform. His eyes are bright with delight and welcome\
  \ for his unexpected foreign visitors.\n  \nMy Mandarin is virtually nonexistent.\
  \  \u201CN\u01D0 h\u01CEo\u201D and \u201CXi\xE8xi\xE8.\u201D Hello and Thank you.\
  \ It\u2019s a modest prelude. \n\nIn time I will come to refer to S\u0113nl\xED\
  n as Forest because Google translate is also my friend. Perusing his densely packed\
  \ tetris of housewares I spy the object of my desire wedged between thermal trousers\
  \ and furry hats: Hangers. I have just met the curator of my creature comfort. With\
  \ a sense of adventure and budding friendship our grand pantomime dance begins."
