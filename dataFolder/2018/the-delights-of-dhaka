Text: "\u2018Run!\u2019 \n\u2018The border is about to shut\u2019\n\nFive days earlier\
  \ as I sat reclining in an air conditioned caf\xE9 in Kolkata eating red velvet\
  \ cake and drinking (proper) cappuccino, the thought of running into India across\
  \ the Bangladeshi border at nightfall really was the last thing I expected. Who\
  \ ever heard of a spur of the moment long weekend to Bangladesh? Dhaka isn\u2019\
  t usually listed as a top mini-break destination but actually, it has its charms.\n\
  \nDhaka is the bustling, beating heart of Bangladesh. Walking through old city a\
  \ symphony of traffic noise invades the air.  Every which way streets are bursting\
  \ with stalls, restaurants, and 14.4 million people. A cycle rickshaw ride through\
  \ the city, joining the swathes of others, is a spectacular way to soak in the true\
  \ feel of Dhaka. You can lose an afternoon on a river boat ride, browsing the pink\
  \ palace and Lalbagh fort or mooching round the endless stalls of vibrant New Market.\
  \ \n\nBangladesh is a fascinating country with a turbulent history. The Muslim majority\
  \ state, created first as East Pakistan after partition (the division of British\
  \ India in 1947), did not become it\u2019s own independent country until 1971. The\
  \ border with Myanmar is currently saturated with 650,000 Rohignya refugees which\
  \ makes the political situation more unstable but travel around Dhaka is relatively\
  \ innocuous. The country\u2019s compassion on the Rohignya issue is reflected in\
  \ the helpfulness from the locals that I experienced in Dhaka.\n\nCut back to Kolkata\
  \ and how this began. On this particularly sticky afternoon, one month into an epic\
  \ three month romp around India, Emma and I sit pouring over a map arguing over\
  \ wether to go north to Darjeeling or west to Varanasi. One of us pipes up \u2018\
  Bangladesh is close\u2019. We look at each other, a familiar glimmer in our eyes\
  \ that often leads us into trouble. We are thinking the same thing. \n\nI remember\
  \ that glimmer, on hour twelve of a bus ride that was supposed to take eight, bouncing\
  \ across the Bangladeshi countryside on a seat that isn\u2019t attached. Night is\
  \ falling, the border is about to shut and there is grid lock traffic. The driver\
  \ swerves into the oncoming lane of cars. The whole bus is now rallying around the\
  \ driver, passports out. Eventually as we run across no man\u2019s land, I briefly\
  \ wonder, would I do it all again? But suddenly, we're through, in a tuk tuk, and\
  \ can breathe again. I get a flash to whizzing along the colourful laneways of Dhaka\
  \ in the sunshine, and I know I always would."
