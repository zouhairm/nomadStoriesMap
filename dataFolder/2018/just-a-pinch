Text: "Will it hurt?\" I asked. Expecting reassurance, I was instead waived over to\
  \ join our guide, Ronald, who had been leading us to our awaiting zip-line. As I\
  \ stepped forward I realized I was delaying our groups long-anticipated view from\
  \ the midst of the trees within the wildlife refuge of Hacienda Baru, Costa Rica.\
  \ We had approached the switch-back of compact dirt and woodblock staircases leading\
  \ to our first overlook when Ronald stopped us, pointing out the large ants moving\
  \ along the trail. Picking one up, he explained how the pinchers of leaf-cutter\
  \ ants are strong enough to be used in place of stitches. Before the group had time\
  \ to nod in understanding, he asked if anyone would like to help demonstrate. I\
  \ heard expressions of disbelief and confident declines, including a \u201Chell\
  \ no\u201D, up the line of participants already clad in their safety belts for the\
  \ paid experience that was well within reach. I began to reflect on the care we\
  \ were supposed to take to avoid potentially deadly animals from the information\
  \ sessions preceding our organized trip. Despite this, a flicker of curiosity supplied\
  \ the air from which I spoke up. I walked over and Ronald asked me to put out my\
  \ hand. As he pushed together a fold of my skin between the thumb and forefinger,\
  \ I instinctively jerked my head up to look at the foliage resting along the steady\
  \ incline of the path directly ahead. Soon I felt a pinch, and the pressure continued\
  \ to build as Ronald blew cool air on my hand. I was sure that the skin had been\
  \ broken when Ronald announced to the group that the insect would not stop building\
  \ force in its steady bite. Before I could begin to panic, he tore the body off\
  \ in one quick twist and I looked down to inspect the now consistent, dull tightness\
  \ in my hand. All that remained was the deep red-head in a literal death-grip. The\
  \ timing of his comment and the expression that followed let me know that Ronald\
  \ had a strong sense of tricky humor. Inspiring fear, but not long enough for those\
  \ impacted to feel reproachful about it. As I began to wonder how what remained\
  \ of the ant was going to be removed, Ronald rubbed his palm against the head and\
  \ it crumbled easily. All that was left was the pinch mark of indented skin that\
  \ would fade away within the next few minutes. Continuing up the steps to the platforms\
  \ from which we would catch a birds eye view of the rainforest, I knew the highlight\
  \ of my travels had splintered into the cause of a pinch rather than the expected\
  \ leap."
