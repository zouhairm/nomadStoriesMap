Text: "An ominous view through the taxi window set off a flight of butterflies in\
  \ my stomach. Entangled in fog and rain, the silouhette of Volcan baru loomed in\
  \ the distance against the dark speckled sky. With a 13.5 km hike each way, my friend\
  \ Emma and I expected to be hiking for the next 12 hours.\n\nIt was midnight when\
  \ the taxi dropped us off at the beggining of the trail. Wind blew water droplets\
  \ from the trees, splattering us with chilly sensations. I took a deep breath as\
  \ I hoisted my pack onto my shoulders and stared up at the night sky. Bright stars\
  \ provided us with a glimmer of hope as we made the first few steps through the\
  \ fierce wind and onto the dark trail. \n\nThe walk up was freezing and wet, but\
  \ the stars were bright and beautiful. The forest was alive with dancing shadows\
  \ as our flashlights shot through the trees. Creaking trees and tumbling rocks stimulated\
  \ our imagination as the foggy darkness engulfed us. We continued up the steep incline,\
  \ the pack felt as though it was getting heavier, and every step raised the intensity\
  \ of the burning sensation in my legs. \n\nI could feel my face throb with every\
  \ heart beat when I stopped for some water. Deciding to lighten the mood and focus\
  \ on something other than the sorenesss of our bodies, I grabbed my speaker to play\
  \ music. Ambient psytrance fit the scene perfectly as we continued through the mountains.\
  \ With every step of the hike we left behind any part of ourselves not strong enough\
  \ for the journey.\n\nAfter a long 5 hour hike, we had reached the summit. The peak\
  \ was hugged by a cloud, giving the native flora a mysterious foggy glow. Even though\
  \ our gaze couldn't meet either of the Panamanian coasts, the ocean made it's presence\
  \ known as dry salty mist whipped at our faces and soaked through our hair. We climbed\
  \ the jagged peak allowing the textures of the lichen to soften the feeling of the\
  \ cold rock face. Graffiti and satisfaction reflected throughout the eyes of those\
  \ at the top that day. \n\nAllowing the beauty of the mist to flow through our being\
  \ kept our appreciation of the moment from being clouded, despite the visibility\
  \ allowing us only to see coat to coat, rather than coast to coast. \n\nThe hike\
  \ down was magnificent, the sun shining through patches of mist onto vibrant flora.\
  \ Humming birds lit up the sky like a show of fireworks around brightly colored\
  \ flowers. Our hike down was again in tune to psytrance music, only this time coming\
  \ from the beaks of birds as they celebrated the new day."
