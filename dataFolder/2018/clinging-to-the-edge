Text: "\u2018Voc\xEA gosta de aventuras?\u2019 I must have looked at my guide with\
  \ a puzzled expression, so he repeated the question a bit slower. Do I like adventures,\
  \ I shrugged my shoulders, and replied a little, as we continued hiking in the unforgiving\
  \ sun. I guess he thought it wasn\u2019t common for a solo female to hike for days\
  \ through the mountains of Chapada Diamantina with just a guide and only basic Portuguese.\
  \ \n Waking up with the first rays of sunshine on the third morning I was in my\
  \ element. This was the day I had been walking for. The day we would reach the waterfall,\
  \ Mixila. We packed up the tent and left our bags to be picked up on our return.\
  \ The canyon narrowed as we progressed further along it.  The different layers of\
  \ sedimentary rock forming its sides looked as if they were pieces from a messy\
  \ game of jenga  piled on top of each other, one touch away from collapse. Our pathway\
  \ had disappeared into the side of the canyon. Following my guide I plunged into\
  \ the clear, narrow pool at the base of the canyon.The cold water sent a chill down\
  \ my spine as I glided to the other side, clambered across a few rocks and jumped\
  \ into the next pool. Reaching the end of the third pool I climbed the boulders\
  \ at the end and looked round the corner. To my disappointment, I couldn\u2019t\
  \ see the next one to jump into. My guide was waiting for me and pointed to the\
  \ edge of the canyon. My heart raced as I contemplated the next part of our journey.\
  \ He wanted me to scale across the side of the canyon, without my trainers or a\
  \ harness and a few days walk away from the hospital.  One slip and I didn\u2019\
  t want to think about what followed. \nFrom the comfort of swimming in the pool\
  \ the canyon had smiled back at me majestically with sunlight filtering  through\
  \ the layers of the rock, now as I moved to cling onto the sides it glared at me\
  \ menacingly. Petrified, I demanded that we moved extremely slowly and that he couldn\u2019\
  t move too far forward. He smiled and responded \u2018See, you can speak perfect\
  \ Portuguese.\u2019 With every drop of cold water that fell from my hair onto my\
  \ back, the fragility of life swept across my body. As we reached the end, I barely\
  \ had the chance to feel relieved, as I saw we had to climb a small waterfall. My\
  \ legs were weak against the force of the water so he used his as a barrier to stop\
  \ me from slipping.  I was so focused on every step, that when I finally stood on\
  \ a secure rock, I looked up and realised we had arrived. \n\nNow I understood why\
  \ he asked if I like adventures."
