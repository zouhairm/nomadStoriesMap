Text: "Japan is a relatively small island, if you consider it holds more than 128\
  \ million people.  The fact that big cities are so crowded, but you can also find\
  \ vast places where nothing but nature is found, is mysterious. This contrast truly\
  \ leaves you breathless. I felt, as we moved east, towards Koyasan, the soul of\
  \ this nation rests in local people, who hold their traditions very dearly. \nMy\
  \ family and I spent two nights in the Saizen Monastery, a choice I highly recommend.\
  \ You get the chance to experience how monks live their lives, and they warmly welcome\
  \ you. You may realize this lifestyle reaches to fuse itself with the environment,\
  \ and succeeds. It is a healing experience.\nDuring our stay in Koyasan, we kept\
  \ a vegan diet, and discovered, at least, seven ways of preparing tofu! Our light\
  \ meals were prepared with such dedication; you could feel nothing but gratitude.\
  \ \nThere is a beautiful hike called the Women Pilgrim\xB4s path, used to gone over\
  \ by the women who had no access to Koyasan two hundred years ago. It meanders through\
  \ the thick forest, a powerful landscape. You have to be careful with the bears,\
  \ though!\nWe also visited a huge cemetery, where the founder of Koyasan lays. Looking\
  \ up to the cypresses, some of them sixty meters high, took our breaths away. The\
  \ gravestones were surrounded by stone lamps with different sizes and forms, split\
  \ all over as if they just grew from the ground. The tombstones took up the landscape\
  \ until the horizon.\n How did I feel? Small. Lost in a place that knew nothing\
  \ about time. Aware of thousands of generations lying there, who lived lives I knew\
  \ nothing about.  I felt the power of this civilization deep into my soul.\nThat\
  \ was just a small part of what I experienced, as we kept traveling and met the\
  \ post towns built along the Nakasendo Trail. This rout joined Tokyo and Kyoto during\
  \ the Edo period, so these tiny villages were made to shelter travelers.\nThey really\
  \ keep that host spirit. I will never get over their kindness. We were often surprised\
  \ by a hot cup of green tea made by a widowed man, or were rewarded with some fresh\
  \ fruit in a little market. Maybe they were just surprised by our rounded eyes,\
  \ but I felt there was more than that. They wanted,..., needed, to share.\nWe have\
  \ so much to learn about this kind of lifestyle, where the connection between neighbors\
  \ is very well taken care of. I felt that connection because they gave me the chance\
  \ to be a part of it.\nAnd that is what traveling is all about, isn\u2019t it?"
