Text: "Oh my Good. You\u2019ll not believe. Snow is a real thing. I swear.\nWe were\
  \ in an all-you-can-see trip through Europe, travelling from Barcelona to Paris\
  \ to Berlin to Munich. Ok, in scale of sun, we are in sincere gradient. But it always\
  \ can come to rain. Rain I know. Rain is real. \nI was not planning to see snow\
  \ at all. As a skeptic Brazilian, I did not believe in snow. But life goes around,\
  \ you know.\nFirst was Berlin. We were going to the Mauer Park to see the collection-of-peculiarities\
  \ Sunday fair, in love with the wide German streets and breakfasts. Three little\
  \ white things in my arms and me and my boyfriend were like: \u201CIs this snow?\u201D\
  \ We were seeing dragons. Really. Little ones. Melting ones. But dragons.\nWhite\
  \ M&M\u2019s making reticence, I remember to think below the providential roof of\
  \ a closed store. Just us were laughing about the whether, of course. For the locals,\
  \ seems like plat du jour. For us, was carnival with white glitter and we were not\
  \ even sure that was really snow.\nIn Munich for the classic Neuschwanstein castle\
  \ visit, the invasion starts to get serious. Overnight, the streets have turned\
  \ into white. Out of nowhere. I swear. Same colors M&M\u2019s. By the train, going\
  \ to F\xFCssen, I\u2019m serious, everything was suddenly white. Like a cloud up\
  \ and down.\nAnd everywhere. You cannot find even one shape in those omnipresent\
  \ clouds. Was beautiful and sad like a tropical storm is beautiful and cruel.\n\
  Funny thing. Somehow, all that white remembered me of chocolate and hot mug. Milk\
  \ when you keep stirring to mix some houses or threes, in this case.\nAnd also a\
  \ joke. A bad joke. So I\u2019ll leave it for the end.\nWe choose to make the path\
  \ to the castle by walking. I put plastic bags on my tropical shoes and discovered\
  \ that, in the snow, we don\u2019t have legs. We have two sticks. Coconuts threes.\
  \ Seriously, we moved ourselves one centimeter at the time. Like we were obsessed\
  \ with putting our little Brazilian foot all the way, organizing the cold sand.\n\
  I was barely sure that the world was really keeping going, one white after another.\
  \ Everything seems the same no-milk ice-cream and, somehow, by not-seeing the mountains,\
  \ they became bigger. Transcendental stuff. As we know that there is a child under\
  \ the white sheet, I could feel the presence of the mountains under that special\
  \ one. We get historical places and also ghost clothes.\nAnd that joke was still\
  \ haunting that diamond moment: \u201Cin order to survive, we\u2019ll have to get\
  \ naked and hug ourselves\u201D. I blamed the movies, of course."
