Text: "The waves stirred up flotsam of plastic bottles and betel leaf baskets of daily\
  \ offerings. I let it bounce around my legs as I waded out in the warm water, still\
  \ cooler than the heavy air. The sand stayed in weird crevices like ear nooks and\
  \ in between my toenail and the pink flesh around it.\nI peddled an old bicycle\
  \ away from Old Man\u2019s Beach, the sun beating down on my exposed skin, still\
  \ salty from the ocean. When I pulled up to the gas station slash bodega slash living\
  \ room, I rang the bell on the handlebar to let the old man know the bike was back.\
  \ I greeted the owner of the cafe next door and sat down at one of the sidewalk\
  \ tables, macrame plant hangers swinging above me while scooters with surfboards\
  \ hanging off the sides rushed past just feet away. My watermelon juice arrived\
  \ with an ant in it. I\u2019d been in Canggu, Bali for almost a week and this was\
  \ routine on non-work days, except the ant. \n\u201CCan I ask you a question about\
  \ your culture?\u201D Lenga asked me. Of course, ask away, I was entirely engaged.\
  \ Lenga is the owner of the watermelon juice cafe next door to the homestay set\
  \ back from the beach traffic. She sat down and looked at me across the ashtray\
  \ on the table between us, brushing her bangs off her forehead with the back of\
  \ her thumb to reveal her dark-lined eyes.\n\u201CHow do Americans think of single\
  \ women?\u201D In the capital of Jakarta, where Lengga grew up, no one cared if\
  \ you were married or single. But here, in the small beach town of Canggu, she is\
  \ told to get married and have children, even though she is almost 50. I said I\
  \ think it is the same in America. In large cities, women are free to explore their\
  \ careers or art and create a family when and if they wanted to, but there was more\
  \ pressure in smaller towns to be a mom, to adopt the status quo. \u201CI think\
  \ they are more conservative here,\u201D she said, apologizing for her poor English.\
  \ I noted her English was very good and she said she\u2019s trying to get the girls\
  \ in her shop to practice more but they are intimidated by all the different English\
  \ accents. I told Lengga that she was the mother to the girls who worked in her\
  \ shop and she laughingly noted that I was the mother to the 740 Thai kids I taught\
  \ English. \nA week later, when I was gone from Canggu and Mount Agung was spewing\
  \ ash, Lenga texted me to make sure I was okay. She offered food and shelter if\
  \ needed, now or any time. As the volcano continued to erupt 18km away, I emailed\
  \ my worried mother and told her, it\u2019s okay, I\u2019ll be taken care of."
