Text: "I needed shelter. About 300 metres away I saw the glow of an Irish pub. The\
  \ cold had sapped all my strength and I feared if I felt the warmth I wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to face heading back outside again. I trundled towards it - my walk hesitant\
  \ despite my mind knowing I would proceed. \n\nI decided to order a beer. As I dithered\
  \ between Guinness and Murphy\u2019s Irish Stout, a local guy chimed in and recommended\
  \ I go with Guinness. We got talking and I told him of my adventures hitchhiking\
  \ around Ireland. I could see him becoming increasingly angry. He eventually accused\
  \ me of being \"totally naive\" and \"irresponsible\" for putting myself in such\
  \ risky situations and told me he would \"never let his sister do this\". I paused,\
  \ having found myself in the ever-common limbo state between brushing off his sexist\
  \ judgment and challenging it. A quote that I had seen earlier that day pressed\
  \ in on me, \"If you remain neutral in times of injustice, you have chosen the side\
  \ of the oppressor\". No change ever comes from sitting quiet.\_ There is definitely\
  \ a time and place to confront fear and prejudice but if you always let things slide,\
  \ for the sake of ease, or to avoid the label of being \"that crazy bitch\", nothing\
  \ will ever begin to improve. So I spoke.\n\_\nFor women to stop travelling alone\
  \ would be to acknowledge that we are to blame if anything bad happens and, by extension,\
  \ to collaborate in our own oppression. My gender is continually emphasized to the\
  \ detriment of my independence; my vulnerability is signalled rather than my strength\
  \ and courage praised. Half the world is to submit whilst the other half continues\
  \ to enjoy what it views as provocative and wilful when exercised by women. Men\
  \ corrupt cause and effect in order to perpetuate their sense of entitlement and\
  \ their social and political power. \_Is it really me who needs to change? We can't,\
  \ and won't, escape the possibility of attack whether we are in our own community\
  \ or on another continent. What has often been framed as a particularly pressing\
  \ problem for female hitchhikers, therefore, is in fact a problem that pervades\
  \ all societal contexts. The point is not to dismiss the issue, but to suggest its\
  \ misapplication in negative critiques of hitchhiking.\n\nI will not succumb to\
  \ the fear induced by the potential actions of others and stop living the life that\
  \ is mine. And one final note to the guy in the bar: I\u2019m glad I\u2019m not\
  \ your sister."
