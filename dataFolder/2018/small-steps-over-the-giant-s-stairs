Text: "The Giant\u2019s Causeway is a 60 million year tango between the lava flows\
  \ of the Antrim Plateau and the freezing tides of the North Atlantic Ocean. Chris\
  \ and I have been swaying together in a half-waltz for a minute or so, shuffling\
  \ in careful circles over its uneven stone columns rising out of the ocean. \nOur\
  \ guide had mentioned that we\u2019d be able to see the shore of Scotland if it\
  \ weren\u2019t so misty, but I have trouble believing there\u2019s more to the world\
  \ beyond this. \n\nIn the first few million years of their dance, a lava flow would\
  \ have poured into the valley, cooling into rigid basalt as the tides crept closer,\
  \ contracting and cracking into 40,000 perfectly hexagonal columns. Upon meeting,\
  \ the Atlantic tides started to erode the pillars to different heights over the\
  \ years, leaving gracefully tapering stone hills that look, as the Irish lore suggests,\
  \ like the beginning of a bridge across the ocean, meticulously crafted by a Giant.\n\
  \nThe Causeway is our last stop in a pilgrimage to see the best rocks in Ireland.\
  \ Chris and I have been together for about six months, and in that time I\u2019\
  ve allowed him learn more about me than anyone. I worried for weeks about asking\
  \ him to join me for what was supposed to be my first solo trip- worried that sharing\
  \ the experience might make it less important for me.\n\nI forgot this fear early\
  \ on as I realized that a second perspective added to every moment of the trip,\
  \ and it was far from my mind as we stepped onto the rocks of the Causeway. We\u2019\
  d spent the previous night and the morning hauling our packs between trains, busses,\
  \ and coffee shops from Ireland\u2019s southwestern peninsula to its most northeastern\
  \ point. Now, we were finally able to climb over these last contours of the Earth\
  \ to reach the edge of the island- the edge of the Earth as far as we could tell.\
  \ We laughed as we balanced on the tiny columns to climb over the hill, joining\
  \ the middle-aged group from our bus as they scampered across the rocks like children\
  \ on a jungle gym.\n\nThe rocks taper to a point about a hundred feet into the ocean.\
  \ I take Chris\u2019 hands as we walk out as far as we can and start to sway. We\
  \ match the rhythm with the waves that flow over the pillars and throw cold drops\
  \ of saltwater into the air. I lean against his shoulder, catching part of the view\
  \ through his glasses. The fractured rock refracts through the droplets on the lenses,\
  \ showing hundreds of permutations of the Causeway and the ocean. I\u2019m grateful\
  \ for the extra set of eyes."
