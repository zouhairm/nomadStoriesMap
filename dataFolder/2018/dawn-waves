Text: "The sky was soon to be set on fire. While Bali is often known for its brilliant\
  \ sunsets, rising early enough allows one to take in equally breathtaking sunrises.\
  \ The visual explosions of the dawn Bali skyline are all the better when floating\
  \ out in the ocean on a surfboard. In the moments before the sun rises one can feel\
  \ a sense of peace and serenity there, floating far out behind the breaking of the\
  \ waves Bali is so famous for.\n\nI had been on the Island of the Gods for four\
  \ days. My new friend Danny and I ran across the beach under the cover of darkness.\
  \ We each held a surfboard under our arms. I had always surfed occasionally since\
  \ I was a young man. When ever I visited a location with waves I was out there.\
  \ Now here in a surfing mecca I hoped to develop my skills and really learn how\
  \ to surf. As we pushed ourselves forward running across the sand it squished between\
  \ our toes. The break we would be paddling out to was a good 10 minute jog from\
  \ our home. \n\nAfter running down the beach came we upon a man trying to pull a\
  \ blue boat with a narrow hull and side skiff to the ocean. He seemed to be struggling\
  \ with the boat's weight. Perhaps high tide might have pushed it further inwards\
  \ than he had wished. When we came upon him as we ran down the beach Danny and I\
  \ dropped our surfboards and set about trying to help him get his boat to the water.\
  \ The largest man of the three of us, I went to the back of the boat and dug in\
  \ my heels and started to push. Danny and our fisherman friend pulled it by gripping\
  \ the ropes tied to the boat. \n\nNow with three people pushing and pulling the\
  \ boat, it slid across the black sand as though it was ice. When the boat was half\
  \ in the waterline and half out the man turned to us and smiled. He gently pressed\
  \ his hand to his chest to show his thankfulness. There were no words between us.\
  \ We did not know each other\u2019s names or stories. Danny and I not able to speak\
  \ Indonesian and he not able to speak English. Yet there in the morning darkness,\
  \ the stuff that makes up the sky before the sun rises, there was a bond. Two surfers\
  \ and a fisherman all from different worlds yet brought together with a random act\
  \ of kindness and a silent prayer of thanks."
