Text: "Dark clouds and a sweltering heat presage the coming of a storm. A horde of\
  \ children has gathered at the Municipal hall of Antananarivo despite the threatening\
  \ sky.\n\nMy curiosity has the better of me as I approach the crowd. Its appearance\
  \ nonetheless makes one ask, what\u2019s all the fuss about?\n\u201CWe are fighting\
  \ for our liberty.\u201D answers Ikoto, a 14-year-old protestor.\n\nIkoto is one\
  \ of them. One of those children left behind. In rural areas of Madagascar where\
  \ cattle are raised on large scale, parents forbid their sons to attend school to\
  \ become herdsmen. Their fate is sealed.\n\nIn an ultimate desire to make their\
  \ voices heard, they chant defiant slogans:\n\n\u201CHey humans! We are humans,\
  \ too! No to child labor!\u201D\n\nMora-Mora (slowly), the crowd fades away and\
  \ life returns to some semblance of normality.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m game!\u201D Ikoto\
  \ replies eagerly as I suggest we go for a walk to the Ikopa River.\n\nTogether\
  \ we venture in the chaos of Antananarivo.The increasingly dilapidated road hosts\
  \ various displays, mixing spoiled meat and stale fruits. The buildings of the colonial\
  \ administration rot slowly under the tropical winds. Cracked walls, peeling paint\
  \ in an explosion of pastel confetti; mirage of an unfinished film set. The whitish\
  \ colonnades become ochre, streaked with red waves betraying the last rainy seasons.\
  \  Schizophrenic-city drowned under exhaust gases; we would want to flee\u2026at\
  \ first.\n\nSitting by the edge of the river, Ikoto confides in me about his life.\
  \ He is an orphan. A \u201Czebus-keeper\u201D as he says, never without his ripped\
  \ backpack and a stick to electrify the zebus\u2019 hind legs. You can meet him\
  \ along the green-apple paddy fields; indefatigable, obsessed by the advance of\
  \ the mighty horned beasts.\n\nA time-out. An instant of peaceful introspection.\n\
  \n\u201CLong ago, before humans, THB beer, lemurs, God created the baobabs. They\
  \ were sublime, attracted all birds of paradise to their branches. Proud of their\
  \ beauty, the baobabs became arrogant. God, to punish them, turned them- roots upward\
  \ and boughs underground. They look like \u2018upside down trees\u2019 with their\
  \ large trunks and skeletal branches. They stand out the landscape like majestic\
  \ anomalies. Their sin of pride suits them so well,\u201D Ikoto intones solemnly.\n\
  \nI listen, enraptured by the tale.\n\nA slight mood floats in the air as we contemplate\
  \ the imposing scenery in front of us. The baobab is present, it remains upright\
  \ whatever the conditions. We consume, in moderation, those snatches of well-being\
  \ stolen from life."
