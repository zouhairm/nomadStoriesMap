Text: "Enchanting walls, cobblestone roads, and stunning architecture. The ancient\
  \ Roman city of York, England bellows with a rich history and many famous sights.\
  \  Buzzing with tourists hurrying around to visit the next TripAdvisor recommendation,\
  \ I found myself at a pedestrian cross with an elderly couple. Immediately intrigued\
  \ by the conversation that ensued, I had the choice to continue ahead and see the\
  \ sights on my checklist or to push aside my agenda and be present in the moment.\
  \  \n\nStories tell us who we are.  They inspire us, they connect us and they provoke\
  \ emotion\u2014excitement, sadness, joy, inspiration. \n\nCaptivated by their story,\
  \ I decided to continue listening as we strolled through the ancient gates and made\
  \ our way into the city. A  war veteran, an Olympic hopeful, journeying across the\
  \ world by boat, falling in love and starting a family.  Their days are now spent\
  \ together either playing with their grandchildren, going for Sunday drives, or\
  \ walking to the supermarket to get fresh fish.\n\nTheir story was simply beautiful.\n\
  \nThe last thing I expected was to discover that after all these years of travel\
  \ I had been doing it all wrong. It\u2019s not about the next destination or visiting\
  \ every tourist highlight.  And it certainly shouldn\u2019t involve rushing.  Traveling\
  \ is most impactful when you truly experience the culture, people, and way of life.\
  \  It\u2019s about slowing down and allowing yourself to be present in the moment,\
  \ engaging in conversation and listening to others.  By intentionally creating space\
  \ in your agenda and bridging cultural barriers, you discover so many amazing and\
  \ wonderful things. \n\nRegardless of the location in the world, everyone\u2019\
  s story is dusted with trials, triumphs, tribulations, joys, and celebrations. Every\
  \ individual has the choice to live out each day to the fullest, regardless of the\
  \ situations or circumstances they face. There is no \u2018perfect\u2019 story or\
  \ one that is better than the next, however, the ability to tell our story lies\
  \ within each of us.  At the end of the day, we are the authors of our lives. \n\
  \nI didn\u2019t get to see any of the sights on my \u2018checklist\u2019 that day\
  \ in York.  Rather, I spent the afternoon engaging in a beautiful and meaningful\
  \ conversation. To me, this is more memorable and impacting than marveling at another\
  \ statute or visiting another museum."
