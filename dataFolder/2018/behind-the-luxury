Text: "A large hill was all that divided the reality of where so many locals were\
  \ living and where many tourists came to stay on the island. Landing in Fiji I was\
  \ greeted with flowers, songs, and smiling faces. Sailing from the main island to\
  \ a private island with a small resort that we temporarily called home I felt as\
  \ if I was living a life other than my own and I somehow had entered this luxurious\
  \ lifestyle. An endless amount of drinks on the beach, snorkeling, and scuba diving\
  \ through endless coral.\nBehind the resort was a large hill with a local village\
  \ on the other side and George, a local of the island, invited us to visit with\
  \ him one day. We hiked up and over the mountain to the small village, Soso. Over\
  \ the past few months, Fiji had been hit by multiple cyclones that caused an extensive\
  \ amount of damage though you would have never guessed from the condition of the\
  \ resort. Throughout the village were houses that were barely standing, items from\
  \ households still floating in areas that had flooded, and debris coating the ground.\
  \ Walking through the village I quickly realized how much time and effort individuals\
  \ had put into rebuilding the resort to ensure tourists could still come and how\
  \ little time they have been able to spend to rebuild their own village. George\
  \ brought us to the elementary school on the island where the walls were coated\
  \ in pictures made by the students with various sayings ranging from \"God will\
  \ protect us\" and \"we can rebuild\". We spent the whole afternoon in the village\
  \ talking to the locals about their experiences and how they have handled the past\
  \ cyclones. I had the opportunity to talk to one of the elementary school teachers\
  \ and she explained to me that the members of the village have one large community\
  \ where they all support each other in times of celebration and in times of need.\
  \ The belief that everyone is family is one they hold close to their hearts and\
  \ live by. \nThat night when we returned to the resort a couple of the workers hosted\
  \ a traditional Fijian ceremony for us and taught us the importance of each item\
  \ and action throughout the ceremony. This day is a day that I cherish most throughout\
  \ my trip to Fiji. Being able to make a connection with the locals I find a much\
  \ more meaningful and valuable experience than any other I had on the trip. This\
  \ experience has changed my view on traveling as I now strive to obtain a more local\
  \ connection to the place that I am visiting and gain a more authentic experience."
