Text: "I was dangerously close to turning 30 and, like many na\xEFve 29-year olds,\
  \ my list was beginning to feel dwarfed by the metaphorical bucket.  I needed to\
  \ embark on the soul searching international trip, and quickly!  After some exhaustive\
  \ research and discussion with my more well-travelled friends, I decided on Argentina\
  \ for two weeks.  \n\nI boarded the flight to Buenos Aires with my brand-new suitcase,\
  \ Lonely Planet guide (with color coded tabs for quick reference), and sightseeing\
  \ itinerary.  After months of planning, I couldn\u2019t have been more prepared.\
  \  A short twelve hours later, I walked off the plane into the customs area, and\
  \ was instantly terrified.  Oh my god, I\u2019m in Argentina.  By myself.  Did I\
  \ mention the only Spanish I spoke was what I could identify from the Taco Bell\
  \ drive thru menu?  This was a horrible idea!\n\nNeedless to say, from every taxi\
  \ driver who attempted broken English conversation, even after I managed a \u201C\
  no hablo castellano\u201D, to watching the sun rise over the Andes on the bus to\
  \ Bariloche, I fell in love with the massive and diverse country.  This trip further\
  \ stoked my curiosity about this world we live in, and twelve years and thousands\
  \ of frequent flyer miles later, I\u2019m still falling in love with this planet.\n\
  \nHowever, I didn\u2019t realize what would be perhaps the most crucial lesson I\
  \ learned from that trip until years later.  As exciting as it is to plan and experience\
  \ solo travel, there is always an element of the unexpected involved, a departure\
  \ from the familiar, comfortable bubble of home.  And as life began to throw some\
  \ curve balls my way, as it tends to do, my solo travel became my touchstone.\n\n\
  Losing a job during the Great Recession?  No problem, I hiked a waterfall in Costa\
  \ Rica.  The end of a relationship?  A cake walk after scuba diving with sharks\
  \ in Fiji.  Massive career change?  Did I mention the ferry crash in Thailand? \
  \ As my real world departed from the researched itinerary, my fear began to dissolve.\
  \  I began to make decisions out of curiosity and trust, rather than anxiety, and\
  \ haven't looked back.\n\nTwelve years ago, in that Argentinian customs intake,\
  \ I learned to trust myself and know that, in the face of the unexpected, everything\
  \ would be ok.  And, after navigating this life without a highlighted guidebook,\
  \ I still believe that.  Muchisimas gracias Argentina, and I still miss your empanadas."
