Text: 'In 2013 my brother died in a car accident and shortly after I got fired at
  my job for "not being the same person anymore". It was a very stressful period of
  my life so one of my best friends, a magician from Barcelona invited me to come
  see him for some weeks with an idea of inviting another friend who went through
  a bad relationship break up and doing a road trip to a small village near Cuenca
  to visit another friend of ours who is a very spiritual person living in a small
  tent on a field. The trip was supposed to be a spiritual healing for both of us
  but ended up being something much more. Just before we went on the trip my boyfriend
  broke up with me, by cheating on me in front of me, his girlfriend broke up with
  him cause she wasn''t ready for a relationship. Three of us all heart broken and
  lost took our things and his car and went driving. We talked a lot, cored a lot
  and smiled a lot. The entire trip we were going up and down in our emotions trying
  to come on terms with our losses. We questioned ourselves a lot. The things we wanted
  to do with our lives, what was expected from us by the societies we lived in etc.
  At the end I gave my friends my notebook to write something in it and what one of
  them wrote: " I like to think of peoples lives as threads and every time we interact
  with someone, we make a knot that stays knotted for the rest of lives and the one
  we made on this trip is one of the most special knots in the thread of my life"
  made me thing how much I was loved by them and how much I want to live again.'
