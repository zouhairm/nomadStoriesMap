Text: "Sinaia was built on the hills of the Carpathian Mountains, landscape of Transylvania\u2019\
  s gruesome folktales and secular end of Mitteleuropa. However, the small town does\
  \ a fine job at hiding it. Today, overqualified Cross Country cars drive smoothly\
  \ on its newly paved roads, surrounded by colourful alpine cabins. In one of those,\
  \ Vlad opens a big bottle of sparkling water.\nVlad is a short man with vivid eyes\
  \ and a perennial smile, who hasn\u2019t tasted a drop of alcohol for nine years\
  \ and seven months. He serves me a glass of water before answering my rather ambitious\
  \ question. \u201CHow was life under Ceaucescu? Ah! Do you know what I remember\
  \ the most? Being cold and queuing. Often, being cold while queuing\u201D. Vlad\u2019\
  s laughter authorises mine. \nNicolae Ceaucescu was Rumania\u2019s omnipotent ruler\
  \ for 25 years until the popular Revolution of December overthrew him in 1989. Vlad\
  \ was 17 back then and celebrated the tyrant\u2019s death with the blissful ignorance\
  \ of youth. In the following years, the country experienced a turbulent transition\
  \ to democracy. As yesterday\u2019s bureaucrats became today\u2019s capitalists,\
  \ street names, political parties and resource-ownership changed but corruption\
  \ remained. Meanwhile, drinking gradually overtook politics as Vlad\u2019s main\
  \ source of enjoyment. Those were some dark years, he admits. \nBut something changed\
  \ at the dawn of the 21st century. For Vlad, it was a job offer. Horrendously rebellious\
  \ at school, he had always excelled in foreign languages. In spite of communist\
  \ censorship, the young Vlad frequently managed to watch the Hollywood recent blockbusters.\
  \ When a tour guide vacancy opened at Peles\u2019 Castle, his fluency in English\
  \ earned him the position. \u201CI realised life has so much to offer for those\
  \ who work hard\u201D. \nAccording to Vlad, Romania was also given a redeeming chance\
  \ when it joined to the EU in 2007. The country has since experienced strong growth\
  \ and low unemployment. But economics is a secondary issue for Vlad. What counts,\
  \ he tells me, is freedom. Freedom to speak one\u2019s mind, to travel unrestricted,\
  \ to love whoever we want wherever we want. \u201CEurope is the promise of more\
  \ human future\u201D. I ask him if I could write this down. \u201CWhy? These are\
  \ just silly thoughts\u201D. I still write it down. \nIn his mid-forties, Vlad is\
  \ now pushing himself through law school, to serve as a public attorney. \nIn a\
  \ time where nationalism menaces to tear Europe apart, I felt its heart had move\
  \ away from Brussels, Berlin or Paris to bit vigorously here in Sinaia."
