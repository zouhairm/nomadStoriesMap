Text: "The New Year night of 2012 was full of turns and unexpected moments for me\
  \ and my boyfriend so we were not really surprised havind found ourselves dancing\
  \ and singing at a private home party with happy Cubans. But we even couldn\u2019\
  t guess that a more interesting experiencing was waiting for us. Some days after\
  \ while coming back from a walk we heard one of the New Year guys calling us from\
  \ the balcony. That welcoming Cuban called himself Andrew. He seemed happy to see\
  \ us and after a short welcoming he invited us to his flat that was in a huge Spanish\
  \ colonial-style building. Just imagine our surprise! We hurried up to accept his\
  \ invitation.\nHavana is famous for its architecture and we were really interested\
  \ in Cuban style of life. Walking from the long and spacious corridors of that magnificent\
  \ building it was impossible not to feel sorry for the inhabitants and the same\
  \ time not to be angry at the local administration which was obviously not interested\
  \ in maintaining such a legacy. The painting on the walls was of different colours\
  \ if present at all. Some holes in the walls were hidden with pieces of carton.\
  \ We felt a bit lost and were struck by the contrast of the flat. It was small but\
  \ very cozy with simple wooden furniture of bright colours. The doors of the balcony\
  \ were widely open welcoming the sun and the atmosphere of the street. The flat\
  \ was fulfilled with the sounds of a huge TV set which was the only thing that connected\
  \ us with the reality. It was a huge LCD screen, one of the latest models, broadcasting\
  \ some typical Latin-American music and dancing.\nI remember the very beginning\
  \ of the conversation. \n\u201CWhat would you like to drink?\u201D asked Andrew.\
  \ \nBy that moment we had been in Cuba for more than a week and I really missed\
  \ black tea that was almost impossible to find in the hotels. \u201CA tea would\
  \ be wonderful, if it\u2019s possible!\u201D \nHe seemed confused for a moment.\
  \ \u201CYou are not in England or\u2026Switzerland! We drink coffee here\u201D,\
  \ he responded.\nTo be honest I did feel stupid. How could I be that egoistic? \u201C\
  Oh, I am so sorry. You are right! A homemade Cuban coffee would be great!\u201D\n\
  When Andrew served amazingly smelling and tasting strong coffee in little green\
  \ cups I was very thankful to our host for him having been insistent. I still remember\
  \ us chatting about our lives in different continents drinking the best coffee I\
  \ have ever tried in a little light-lit colourful Cuban flat. That became the precious\
  \ memory from the whole trip to sunny Cuba."
