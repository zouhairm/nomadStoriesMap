Text: "While in Tokyo, I\u2019m inspired by the film Lost in Translation. I buy myself\
  \ a pink wig and, canned cocktail in hand, go to find some karaoke. This loosely\
  \ made plan is waylaid, when a group of Japanese businessmen on their way to an\
  \ Izakaya ask me to join.\n\n\u201CDo you like sex?\u201D one man asks me. I can\u2019\
  t tell if it\u2019s a translation mishap or he\u2019s mistaken me for a prostitute.\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019m a lesbian,\u201D I tell them.\n\nNo one seems to understand. I\
  \ hold up one index finger. \u201CGirl.\u201D Then the other. \u201CGirl.\u201D\
  \ I press the tips of my fingers together in an imitation of a kiss. \u201CLesbian.\u201D\
  \n\nThe group looks on blankly.\n\nTime for my last resort. I make a crude gesture\
  \ involving a backwards peace sign and my tongue. The group bursts into laughter.\
  \ They already knew what lesbian meant. They were just playing with me.\n\n\u201C\
  Don\u2019t worry,\u201D Yuma, the best at English, says to me in a conspiratol aside.\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019ll get them back.\u201D\n\nThe izakaya is the kind of place I would\
  \ have never found on my own. Beyond dim alleyways and rickety stairs, we enter\
  \ a seemingly communal area. Everyone is seated together. The clientele is entirely\
  \ Japanese, and quite a few heads turn to me, the obvious foreigner.\n\nI make whatever\
  \ limited small talk that I can with the group. Every now and then, someone leans\
  \ over to Yuma to ask advice on how to talk to me.\n\n\u201CI am ninja,\u201D one\
  \ man tells me.\n\nTaking in his business suit and briefcase, I\u2019m skeptical,\
  \ but I want to be polite. \u201CThat\u2019s interesting.\u201D\n\nAnother gravely\
  \ tells me later: \u201CWe are samurai.\u201D\n\nThis is where I catch eyes with\
  \ Yuma. He smiles. \u201COh really,\u201D I play along, \u201CTell me more.\u201D\
  \n\nBy the end of my first drink, it seems the group is a mixture of ninja-samurai-doctor-lawyers.\
  \ Finally, the last of the group finds a chance to speak with me. Seeing his plan\
  \ come to a culmination, Yuma makes sure everyone is listening.\n\n\u201CWe are\
  \ firefighters,\u201D he says, to the dawning horror of the rest of his friends.\n\
  \n\u201CAre you?\u201D I ask.\n\n\u201CYes,\u201D he says. \u201CVery dangerous.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CDid you go to work today?\u201D\n\nHe nods.\n\n\u201CThen why are you\
  \ in a suit?\u201D\n\nHe pauses. Yuma can\u2019t hold it together any longer. He\
  \ cracks up. \n\n\u201COh,\u201D I say, to the group at large. \u201CSo you aren\u2019\
  t all ninjas? Or samurai? Or firefighters?\u201D\n\nEveryone, suddenly aware of\
  \ Yuma\u2019s part in this, start chastising him before finally joining in on the\
  \ laughter.\n\nYuma orders us another round and then smiles at me. \u201CI told\
  \ you we\u2019d get them back.\u201D It\u2019s good to know that even friendly pranks\
  \ can overcome language barriers."
