Text: "Going to Manali, Himachal Pradesh, was always on my list. After quite a few\
  \ family dinner table talks, we all planned it out and decided to go. We left New\
  \ Delhi at 8 am on a breezy October morning. Technically, I was with my family on\
  \ this trip, but my mind had already wandered away. I reached Manali at around 10\
  \ pm the same day after a really long 14 hours on the road. A lot of friends told\
  \ me to take the flight to Manali instead, but I didn't pay heed. Even the long\
  \ drive didn't feel as tiring, considering the views along the way. We hadn't booked\
  \ any hotel prior to leaving, as our driver told us that there are literally plenty\
  \ to choose from, with a hotel in every nook and corner of the small hill town.\
  \ As hungry as could be, we headed to a local restaurant perched on top of a quaint\
  \ little souvenir shop. And that turned out be one of the not so good dining experiences.\
  \ We were probably the last ones to come in, but that wasn't reason enough for the\
  \ manager to serve us downright horrible food. What was ironic is that we\u2019\
  d simply ordered for a few dishes that are the North Indian staple! After this,\
  \ we went to a hotel that the driver recommended: that was worse than the restaurant\
  \ we visited earlier. Adding to all this, it began to rain. As I was standing outside\
  \ this hotel, a man came by and asked us if we were okay. After having a little\
  \ conversation with him, he gave me an address of a hotel and I wrote down a few\
  \ places to visit too on my journal. He was a pashmina shawl seller hailing from\
  \ Kashmir and he requested us to visit his shop later if we wanted to. We headed\
  \ to the hotel which actually turned out to be pretty decent with good food too\
  \ and was conveniently located on mall road, which is the main market of Manali.\
  \ After a tiring night, the morning after was nothing like the day before. After\
  \ a hearty breakfast, we checked out mall road and the shops and then headed to\
  \ Hadimba temple which was a 20 minute drive uphill from the town centre. The temple\
  \ was tiny and quaint, enveloped by a blanket of pine trees and utmost serenity.\
  \ Spending an hour here, we went to the pashmina shawl seller's shop and bought\
  \ a few shawls of intricate design. He was really glad that we liked the places\
  \ he'd recommended. We formed an unlikely friendship as he told us about his family\
  \ in Kashmir and the art of shawls and embroidery. We enjoyed this over a cup of\
  \ Kashmiri kahwa tea that he was kind enough to offer us. I ended up making a local\
  \ connection in Manali."
