Text: "Breathing in deeply, I filled my lungs with tea-tree scented air, preparing\
  \ my body for the effort to come. The route I had planned to run was familiar only\
  \ in the sense I had researched it extensively, pouring over images on web pages\
  \ portrayed through the eyes of others. While it was near my parent's home in the\
  \ New England area, I had never explored Cathedral Rock National Park.\n\nI was\
  \ anticipating technical trails weaving through native bush-land, culminating in\
  \ a short scramble up and over large granite boulders, their forms rounded to appear\
  \ like large footballs, each balancing on the other in an illogical hierarchy. From\
  \ their tops I would be able to gaze across a carpet of quintessential colours and\
  \ see nothing but wilderness. Such a lure. Worth the effort. I start to run.\n\n\
  Gum trees lined the trail. Stringy barks and ribbon gums mostly. The scribbles of\
  \ moth larvae on tree trunks remind me fondly of Judith Wright's wonderful writing:\
  \ \"I peeled its splitting bark, and found the written track of a life I could not\
  \ read\". Crimson Rosellas dart through the branches and a Wallaby bounds into the\
  \ scrub, stopping a safe distance to watch me curiously. The soundtrack of cicadas\
  \ broken by the laugh of a Kookaburra. \n\nImmersed in the effort of my activity\
  \ and the play of nature, the miles fell away.\n\nI thought about my home in Snowdonia,\
  \ North Wales, for a period: my love of the mountains there and the variety of terrain.\
  \ Yet the one thing I miss is the richness of wildlife experienced when running\
  \ in the Australian bush. This place I grew up, and the place I now call home, so\
  \ different but both so valued. I had committed long ago to keep both in my life.\
  \ \n\nMy laboured breath kicks me back to reality. The track had steepened and I\
  \ was reduced to clambering up gritty rock slopes, ducking under branches and occasionally\
  \ escaping from an entangled ponytail. Finally I reach the top and drink in the\
  \ view. \n\nMy anticipation was surpassed, but the last thing I expected was the\
  \ cheery greeting from a fellow, sitting dangling his legs over the edge of a boulder\
  \ and wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with a Welsh dragon. \"It's so vast\". He said,\
  \ in an all-too-familiar accent. \"So different from where I live - all these trees\
  \ and bugs. It's not what I expected\".\n\nI smiled. He looked so happy and enchanted\
  \ and I understood."
