Text: "In the trip to the old town of Lijiang, China, I hiked at 4,680 meters at the\
  \ Jade Dragon Snow Mountain. Right after I came back to the town, however, altitude\
  \ illness hit me. I barely could breathe.\n\u201CNo!\u201D I was crying in mute,\
  \ \u201CMy nightlife...\u201D\nKnown as the best place for romance, night life is\
  \ the real thing that makes Lijiang famous. Main street turned into club street\
  \ with live bands everywhere. \nI was catching up my breath on street when I saw\
  \ a young Caucasian man with a suitcase standing on the sidewalk staring at his\
  \ front. What is a western guy doing on an empty street? \nWhile I was wondering,\
  \ he suddenly took out a guitar from the suitcase and started to play. I recognized\
  \ the song. His singing came along with melodies, gently but firmly, in Mandarin,\
  \ \u201CLong, long ago, you had me, I had you.\u201D\nPeople started to gather around,\
  \ \u201CForeigner singing Chinese! Come check this out.\u201D He seemed to get motivated\
  \ and started to sing louder and louder.\nHowever, rainstorm came without invitation.\
  \ People scattered quickly. \nHe found a spot under the tree and sat down. \nWhere\
  \ he\u2019s from? Why he\u2019s here? How can he sing in Chinese? Questions exploded\
  \ in my head. Should I go and have a conversation? I watched him for a while and\
  \ finally curiosity drove me to approach him despite of my physical conditions.\n\
  \u201CYou sang so well. Everyone loved it.\u201D \n\u201CThank you. Can we speak\
  \ in Chinese? I\u2019m practicing.\u201D He replied in Mandarin. \nHe\u2019s a medical\
  \ school graduate from Spain, had lived in Shanghai, worked as a doctor and then\
  \ as ambassador at the Embassy of Spain. One day he traveled here and decided to\
  \ become a singer. \n\u201CI write Chinese songs too. I want to have a concert tour\
  \ someday.\u201D\n\u201CI know every place here. You see, I\u2019m a local.\u201D\
  \ He laughed.\nI realized that in front me was someone seriously realizing his dreams.\
  \ I was fascinated. I told him I was leaving the town the next day afternoon. \u201C\
  Meet me in the morning then,\u201D He said, \u201CI\u2019ll show you around.\u201D\
  \nHow could I resist?\nThat morning, my local guide showed up with his bicycle.\
  \ We went through the hidden lanes in town, went up high to see the town roofs and\
  \ had tea at his friend\u2019s tea-house, an unexpected discovery from a local point\
  \ of view. \nYears later, he got his own album, had his concert tour in major cities\
  \ in China, and was in several TV shows. He\u2019s now back in Spain continuing\
  \ his career as a doctor. I learned these by reading his own biography book written\
  \ in Chinese. The book is called, \u201CLive as You Imagine.\u201D"
