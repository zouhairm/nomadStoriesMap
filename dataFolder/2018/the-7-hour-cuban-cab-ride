Text: "The last thing I expected was, to wake up our cab driver. Half way down the\
  \ freeway. Five and a half hours into a seven hour cab ride. For some reason my\
  \ first instinct, when realising the cab drivers\u2019 eyes were firmly shut behind\
  \ the wheel, was to wake up my mate, who was also asleep, but not in control of\
  \ a moving vehicle. I yelled loud enough to wake the both of them up, then quickly\
  \ suggested, what a great time for a coffee. A double shot espresso, followed by\
  \ a handful of chocolate coated coffee beans, and we were back on our way and all\
  \ was good with the world. \n\nAt the bus station in the stunning UNESCO World Heritage\
  \ seaside town of Trinidad, we were looking to buy bus tickets, traveling north\
  \ to Vinales, famous for its lush green limestone mountains, caves, and of course\
  \ fields of cigar tobacco. This is when our cab driver approached suggesting he\
  \ take us in his  taxi. Thinking there was some misunderstanding, I explained how\
  \ far we were going. \u201CYes, yes I take you. Same price as bus\u201D.  \n\nThis\
  \ was just one of many unexpected and memorable human encounters this remarkable\
  \ country offered us. While most are enticed to Cuba, by films of Che and the Buena\
  \ Vista Social club, or coffee table books and classic car filled instagram posts,\
  \ it is the people of Cuba that truly make this an unforgettable travel experience.\
  \ And it begins as soon as you arrive. After our joyous 36 hour journey form Australia,\
  \ we went in search of our first mojito. Tempted by the seductive sounds of live\
  \ salsa bleeding through the streets of Old Havana, we simply followed the music\
  \ and found ourselves in a tiny bar, far from any tourist guide books. Two older\
  \ gentlemen full of conversation, were the only other patrons. One strumming a guitar,\
  \ the other singing. This was not the band, simply two friends making music. Mojitos\
  \ in hand, the moment seemed almost too cliched, too Cuban, as the young barman\
  \ gestured to take the empty plastic water bottle I had from the plane.  Assuming\
  \ he\u2019d throw it away, he instead turned it into an instrument. Taking the blunt\
  \ side of a knife, he began rhythmically scrapping it along the bottle creating\
  \ the missing percussion section of this makeshift band. Perfect.\n\nNever have\
  \ I collected so many stories and memories from one location. Sure, you\u2019ll\
  \ walk the streets, see the cars, hear the music, swim the beaches, smoke the cigars,\
  \ but it's the people of Cuba that leave you with the most colourful images and\
  \ stories to share when you return home."
