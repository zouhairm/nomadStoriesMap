Text: "More or less world, status and overall wellbeing is firstly determined by money\
  \ - even though it sounds harsh, and secondly by the social security and wealth.\
  \ However, my trip to Kenya drastically changed me and my mindset, and indeed that\
  \ was the last thing I expected to happen.\nFor 2 years in a row - 2013 and 2014,\
  \ and again in 2016 Denmark was rated as the happiest country in the world. That\u2019\
  s really something. People in this country feel safe and secure, but is that the\
  \ key to the happiness? While Denmark is ranked on the top of the happiness list,\
  \ Kenya takes 112th place, which is closer being unhappiest country than the number\
  \ 1. But is that really truth?\nOf course, when you think about or hear words Africa\
  \ and Kenya, first things what pops in your mind are either elephants or poverty.\
  \ And yes, it is true. This country is very diverse and parts of it are very poor.\
  \ People are lacking basic household utilities, or houses at all, what in Europe\
  \ is being considered as the norm. Some people live in slum areas, where houses\
  \ are made out of mold or metal sheets, some live on the streets. You ask about\
  \ Internet, electricity, tap water or clean clothing? Nothing. But you know what?\
  \ I have never seen people being happier or as helpful as in Kenya! \nObviously\
  \ these people are having harder and more difficult lives than us, but maybe that\
  \ is how they have learned to appreciate good things in the life. When I donated\
  \ a bag of used clothes you cannot even imagine the warm hugs I received in a return.\
  \ Smile comes first and along with everything. I do not even know if it is possible\
  \ to meet a Kenyan person who is not smiling. It is kind of a birthmark they are\
  \ having wherever they go and cannot get rid of it no matter what.\nAlong with that\
  \ surrounded people are appreciated very highly. Family is not just the closest\
  \ blood related members, but also the whole village and every single neighbor, and\
  \ neighbors can be living miles apart and in some way even I am their \u201Cneighbor\u201D\
  \ now. People considered me as a family member and cared about me. And maybe that\
  \ is the key to the happiness. You love and care about people around you and they\
  \ will do the same. \nYou walk with a smile and happiness will walk along with you.\
  \ You are happy about the good things and will forget about the bad ones. You can\
  \ be the happiest person in the world no matter what is your geographical location.\
  \ Everything depends on you, your mindset and how you perceive life, people and\
  \ happiness."
