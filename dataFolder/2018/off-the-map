Text: "\"Australia? Y'all 've got the same Moos-lem problem as us,\" the retired marine\
  \ from Texas said.\n\nWe were in Wyoming, a group of strangers sitting around a\
  \ campfire, just outside Grand Teton National Park. Each of us had heard about a\
  \ free campsite, at the end of a long, steep, winding, dirt road, with a perfect,\
  \ unobstructed view of the great mountain range. The six of us, all different backgrounds,\
  \ sat together sharing food and swapping travel stories. The man's comment felt\
  \ sudden and out of place. I wondered if it was directed at me.\n\nI was born in\
  \ Iran just after the Revolution. Under the new regime, my family faced persecution,\
  \ so we fled. We lived as refugees for a year, waiting for the Canadian government\
  \ to accept us as immigrants, to find a new, safe home. We weren't exactly welcomed\
  \ with open arms. My dad, who spoke better German than English, earned his PhD and\
  \ worked as a professor in Stuttgart in the 70s. After we moved to Canada, the number\
  \ of accolades he'd earned in Europe didn't matter; his skin was brown. He found\
  \ work at Taco Bell.\n\nAround the campfire, everyone shifted in their seats. Some\
  \ glanced at me, but avoided eye contact, perhaps wondering if he could tell who\
  \ I was. The fire cracked and popped. A cascade of sparks showered the air.\n\n\
  Around the time America's issues with race became the forefront of the presidential\
  \ election, I began this 3 month road trip through the US. My Aussie boyfriend and\
  \ I drove 13,000km in our champagne-coloured minivan. As tensions rose in the country,\
  \ I found myself having conversations with complete strangers about who I am and\
  \ what I believe. Conversations online felt like fights, but coversations in person,\
  \ in parking lots, on hikes, and around campfires, felt like they went somewhere.\
  \ Maybe I put a face to the word, \"refugee.\"\n\nWe stuck around Grand Teton a\
  \ few days before moving on to Yellowstone. I suppose it gave the man from Texas\
  \ a chance to get to know us, but it also gave us the chance to get to know him.\
  \ The morning we were meant to leave, he walked over to our car carrying something.\
  \ \"This is the good stuff I was telling y'all about --here, take it.\" He thrust\
  \ a small packet of prescription moisturizer into my hands. I thanked him.\n\nI\
  \ didn't plan the road trip trying to change anyone or their mind, especially not\
  \ mine. Things rarely go as planned. \n\nAs we drove away, I could see him in the\
  \ side view, standing at the top of the dirt road, waving. I rolled the window down,\
  \ and waved back."
