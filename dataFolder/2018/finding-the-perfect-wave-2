Text: "The alarm woke me, but I have this annoying little habit of shutting it off\
  \ and going back to sleep. Pierre had to call me a total of four times for me to\
  \ finally wake up, I dressed as quickly as I could before taking my board, my coffee\
  \ and my barely awoken body outside.\nGingerly, I placed my board on top of Pierre\u2019\
  s and his fathers in the back of the white truck they drove, and before long I was\
  \ asleep in the backseat of the car. \nLong car rides have this unique effect of\
  \ putting me to sleep in seconds, and our weekly mission of finding a perfect wave\
  \ usually went better when I was sleep deprived.\nThree hours passed before I was\
  \ shaken awake by the bumps in the dirt road that was characteristic of the three-town\
  \ area we would be visiting for the weekend. Nagua, Cabrera, and Rio San Juan are\
  \ a trio of sequential small rural towns in the northeastern coast of the Dominican\
  \ Republic. \nOur first stop was a dud, the waves of Nagua were a chaotic mess of\
  \ stinging wind that blew even the sleep from my eyes, and waves that formed unclimbable\
  \ barrels that formed and collapsed into themselves in the manner of seconds. Pierre\
  \ kicked a few lying coconut shells in frustration, the sun dulled shells running\
  \ through the grass that bordered the beach.\nThe second step was a little gem of\
  \ a surf spot that Pierre\u2019s dad, from decades as a member of the DR\u2019s\
  \ surf community, had uncovered. \u2018I used to come here when I was your age,\
  \ kids,\u2019 the man had said before grabbing his own surfboard and walking away.\
  \ The older generation of surfers were weird that way, introspection and quiet were\
  \ a big part of their surf ritual.\nCoral Bay is a small residential area in Cabrera\
  \ that contrasts the small wooden houses with rusted zinc roofs of the town with\
  \ big mansions of exemplary architecture. But the hidden gem could be found in the\
  \ crystalline blue waters of the softly crashing waves of the beach hidden by the\
  \ residence.\nWithin moments of entering the beach, I would fall into the darkened\
  \ depths of the startling shallow water. My board saved me from injury from the\
  \ dark coral within, but I would taste its poison when I used my lips to take the\
  \ pieces of white marble-like rocks out of the board in search of air leaks.\nThe\
  \ trip had been delayed, our continuous search for the wave stopped as I dealt with\
  \ the damages to my board. But no matter the obstacle, even swollen lips from coral\
  \ poison in my lips, we would not stop in our search for the perfect ride until\
  \ the day was done."
