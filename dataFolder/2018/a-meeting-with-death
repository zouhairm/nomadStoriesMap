Text: "The dog\u2019s oozing red eye followed me as I was navigating the tiny, uneven\
  \ pathways snaking through Varanasi, its motions unnaturally slow and pained. As\
  \ the days passed, I noticed more dogs with red, bulbous eyes laying in distorted\
  \ positions, while cows with deformed horns inched along the alleys.\n\nBackpackers\
  \ spoke of the strange \u201Cvibe\u201D in Varanasi and the sicknesses travelers\
  \ seem to acquire while in this Indian town. Their vivid stories couldn\u2019t prepare\
  \ me for the reality. \n\nThe feeling of death, heavy and crushing under the humid\
  \ summer air, remained even as the bright sun appeared. Like the animals, people\
  \ moved slow and injuries abounded. My friend stubbed her toe, requiring a hospital\
  \ visit and a hostel roommate was bitten by three monkeys at a temple.\n\nShortly\
  \ into my stay in Varanasi, I became disinterested, distant. I wasn\u2019t attracted\
  \ to the city as I was to the rest of India. But to fully appreciate and understand\
  \ Varanasi, I had to encounter death.\n\nWhile out one evening, several men passed\
  \ by me carrying colorfully swaddled bodies. Used to experiencing death at a distance\
  \ in American culture, I wasn\u2019t sure how to react. It felt disrespectful to\
  \ be so close to someone\u2019s deceased loved one.\n\nA man soon approached, asking\
  \ to show me around the ghats. Not wanting to make a spectacle of the burnings,\
  \ but not wanting to close myself off from local encounters, I let him tell me the\
  \ history of the burnings as the orange embers and ashes flew around us.\n\n\u201C\
  Do you see any women here?\u201D the man asked. I then realized I was the only female.\n\
  \n\u201CThey are not allowed because they cry and crying is prohibited on the ghats,\u201D\
  \ said the man.\n\nFor centuries, Hindus across India have brought their dead to\
  \ Varanasi for customary burials. Hundreds of bodies are burned every day, the ashes\
  \ spread in the swirling Ganges river. Those fortunate to die here are said to obtain\
  \ moksha, freedom from the cycle of death.\n\nI sat near the funeral pyres, observing\
  \ locals tending to the fires, sifting through ashes and bathing in the river. These\
  \ men, covered in sweat and enveloped in the smoldering heat, were within inches\
  \ of death every day, yet they laughed and splashed in the water.\n\nThis proximity\
  \ to death made me realize how often my own culture tries to avoid its imminent\
  \ approach \u2013 to push it away with pills and beauty routines. But here death\
  \ was a tangible and persistent presence, not a finality. Only through seeing death\
  \ could I fully appreciate living."
