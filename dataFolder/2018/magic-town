Text: "As soon as you arrive, you move to a colonial city, with narrow streets and\
  \ striking architecture, you begin to decide which church you want to visit first\
  \ - they all have their history and historical value - one is bigger than the other,\
  \ one is adorned only with gold, but another has very important paintings.\nMexican\
  \ cuisine is very varied and some of its dishes are classified by UNESCO as world\
  \ heritage. There is a special dish that is only prepared between the months of\
  \ July and August and also part of the gastronomic heritage: Chile en Nogada, is\
  \ as its name says a preparation with the chile, but unlike what many will be thinking\
  \ that you end up with your mouth on fire, it's a sweet dish, all the chili peppers\
  \ are removed, just to avoid the spicyness and then its stuffed with a sweet walnut\
  \ sauce. They told me that this dish had been created by the nuns at the time of\
  \ the colony; the king asked for something unique, so the nuns used the fruits of\
  \ the season and created this delicious dish.\nMy mission was simple, try all the\
  \ typical Mexican food I could but my main objective was to try Chapulines (roasted\
  \ insects). I started trying the mole poblano, a special disch beause of its preparation,\
  \ it\xB4s very complicated but the taste is different from the rest of the mole\
  \ in Mexico, this one carries chocolate and for lovers of spicy, this dish is ideal.\n\
  While I finished eating a flood fell in Puebla, and as I like the rain I walked\
  \ to the hotel and ended up drenched, but before leaving the restaurant the girl\
  \ who attended me recommended me to go to the food fair that was going to be next\
  \ to the Church of San Ignacio, so I did that.\nIt was already night when I arrived,\
  \ but it is definitely the best place to try food and since I had not eaten I tried\
  \ everything, enchiladas, chocolate, elote, until I reached my goal: Chapulines,\
  \ I had seen them several times but I did not dare to try it, I had the idea that\
  \ the taste was going to be bitter, the guy who served them said to me: \"They wont\xB4\
  t bite you girl!\" and unlike what I expected, I liked the taste and even repeated\
  \ it.\nThe time I spent in Puebla was magical and definitely enriching, I have always\
  \ liked Mexican culture especially because of its vision of life and death and having\
  \ had the opportunity to be part of it for a moment was exciting, I have pleasing\
  \ memories of people, landscapes, food - especially taquerias - friends, music and\
  \ even tequila, I think all this is part of the experience of a Magic Town."
