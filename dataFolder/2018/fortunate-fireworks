Text: "I stole a banana from the crew mess, swiped out at the aft gangway, and set\
  \ off for my last day in Old San Juan. Over the three months I\u2019d spent squirreling\
  \ away savings on a Caribbean cruise liner, I\u2019d gotten to know my favorite\
  \ port. The colorful stucco and shady bodegas were a sunbather\u2019s reimagining\
  \ of my home back in Spain and my refuge from the sterile ship. Mangy cats trailed\
  \ me on my way past kite flyers and piragua vendors, to the walls overlooking the\
  \ cemetery. A familiar plaque pointed to the horizon where, 500 years before, the\
  \ fleets of Christopher Columbus and Ponce de Leon first appeared. As the sun slid\
  \ behind me, I teetered atop the wall and imagined I could see the Spanish coast.\
  \ One more day till home, I thought wistfully, picturing a two-month journey in\
  \ a rickety wooden box and feeling unusually grateful for the sparkling behemoth\
  \ that had brought me across the sea. \nSuddenly the island went dark. In this portentous\
  \ 2016 outage, Puerto Rico wasn\u2019t quite the gaudy paradise it had seemed. I\
  \ gathered the remnants of my lunch as the sky conspired with an exploded power\
  \ plant and the last of the light disappeared behind black clouds. I stumbled down\
  \ slippery cobbles that had seemed colonially quaint in the afternoon. Miserable\
  \ as my feline companions who had already taken shelter, I searched the suddenly\
  \ silent streets for a familiar sign. \n\u201CEy!\u201D A couple huddled in the\
  \ door of a bar offered me cover. I greeted them in Spanish as I wrung out my hair.\
  \ \u201CSpain?\u201D they asked at my accent. I admitted to an American passport\
  \ and Spanish residency. \u201CTwo countries that screwed us,\u201D my saviors laughed.\
  \ With a crackle, the sky flashed green from the cruise port. \u201CThey\u2019re\
  \ celebrating a year at sea,\u201D I offered as explanation for the sparks erupting\
  \ from my transient residence. \u201CDidn\u2019t think they\u2019d do it with this\
  \ rain.\u201D \u201CYou work on the ship?\u201D Turns out Juan and Jessica would\u2019\
  ve given up the glimmering oasis to escape blackouts and unemployment. I thought\
  \ of my cockroach-y flat back in Spain and the electricity bills I\u2019d sacrificed\
  \ my summer to avert, and San Juan felt like home in a different way. Drenched and\
  \ starry-eyed, we watched foreign fireworks stab the temporary haze. Tomorrow I\u2019\
  ll be back in Spain, I nodded, not so wistfully. Just as my summer at sea, I found\
  \ the dark sky of my last day unexpectedly illuminating."
