Text: "Kamala slowly woke up and got up headed to the window in front of the bed.\
  \ The faint light of the sunrise was breaking through the curtains. She had a feeling\
  \ that morning. She was melancholic and nostalgic, so she took her journal and started\
  \ to recall how she ended up living in a small village in the middle of nowhere\
  \ in New Zealand.\nFour years ago, Kamala moved from Paris to Istanbul to escape\
  \ from her life in the city. The life was passing smoothly, she could still remember\
  \ the call of the seagulls travelling from the historical part of the city on the\
  \ European side to the place that she chose as her home, the Asian side. She loved\
  \ to take a walk next to the sea, sitting on the rocks and enjoy the sunset. Kamala\
  \ loved the traditional and authentic life of people in Istanbul, the way they could\
  \ spend the whole day just sitting and drinking \xE7ay while the city itself was\
  \ rushed by the huge amount of tourists and workers. She got used to the city and\
  \ to her life there, to the smell of fish and the smiley simit sellers at every\
  \ corner. However, one day while she was taking pictures of the Blue Mosque under\
  \ the snow, she realized she wanted to move somewhere else. \nAs she did four years\
  \ ago, Kamala packed her things ready to abandon that place. Sometimes you just\
  \ get used to the feeling you live when you start a new life in a completely different\
  \ place. It is a mixture of excitement, fear and sense of unsuitableness. This makes\
  \ you feel that the only way to keep living is moving from one country to another\
  \ and it is not even a choice, but it is an essential need. This is what Kamala\
  \ was experiencing in that moment. \nShe undertook a 6 months travel through the\
  \ Asian continent. She was travelling to an ancient temple when she met Tane, a\
  \ man from New Zealand. Tane had the most interesting aspect Kamala has ever seen.\
  \ He had big and dark eyes, long hair and a constant smile on his face. Kamala thought\
  \ that he was the happiest and most peaceful person on earth. He was so fascinating\
  \ that she decided to stop her journey and discover the country of this man. \n\
  Some people are lucky enough to be born in the place that is also the home for their\
  \ souls, others needs to suffer and get lost to find it. Kamala understood that\
  \ as soon as she reached the city of Karamea. She could certainly keep travelling\
  \ but she found peace in that place surrounded by the incredible silence of the\
  \ Mother Earth. Then, someone knocked on the door, so she put the pen down."
