Text: "The camouflaged geckos darting through the dew-covered leaves may have escaped\
  \ my view altogether if I hadn\u2019t had my eyes on the gravel path the entire\
  \ climb. Surely the majesty of the Austrian forest demanded space in my memory,\
  \ but it was all I could do to fixate on the patterns in the mud my children\u2019\
  s shoes were leaving in front of me. I was afraid to look up, partly because I would\
  \ see the uphill path outstretched seemingly forever and more because my gaze might\
  \ meet the eyes of yet another hiker telling me in a language I did not speak but\
  \ could obviously understand, \u201CYou\u2019re crazy.\u201D When I put on my red\
  \ silk shirt and matching lipstick that morning I clearly had no idea what I was\
  \ getting us into. \n\nI didn\u2019t exactly picture it this way. I was supposed\
  \ to be in the passenger seat, dishing out casual backseat comments to my husband\
  \ like granola bars to the kids behind us. I\u2019d search for radio stations in\
  \ between peaks in the Swiss Alps and he\u2019d take the kids for potty breaks beside\
  \ the most majestic trees we\u2019d ever seen. I would snap photos; we would polish\
  \ off peanuts and get lost in an audio book.\n\nPlans changed. Active duty in the\
  \ US Navy, his time is not his own. Days before our road trip, he was called in\
  \ last-minute to cover unexpected staff shortages. To say the kids were crushed\
  \ would be an understatement. \n\nWhen we finally reached the summit, I knew the\
  \ easy part was over. I hitched my jogging stroller to the side of the chain link\
  \ fence with a giant \u2018Mommy Hook,\u2019 which in other circles would be a carabiner\
  \ large enough to rappel from a lofty peak. I loaded my baby into the backpack carrier.\
  \ I was nowhere near the size of my husband\u2019s 6\u20199\u201D frame and as I\
  \ adjusted the straps I was reminded of the giant-sized escapade I\u2019d brought\
  \ us on.\n\nMortified of heights, I inched out onto the swaying planks of the suspension\
  \ bridge and felt my heart race like I\u2019d leaped from an airplane. I clutched\
  \ the cable handrail and tried to squeeze a smile as my audacious and nimble four\
  \ year-old practically skipped ahead of me. The toddler on my back started kicking,\
  \ \u201CCome on, Mama!\u201D Sweating, I let go long enough to memorialize the moment\
  \ with a selfie- there was no turning back now.\n\nWhile the last thing I expected\
  \ that summer was to be road-tripping through five countries solo with four kids,\
  \ I reconsidered our unexpected disappointment as an excuse for exploration. We\u2019\
  re discovering fear, challenge and surprise are part of life and adventure is what\
  \ you make it."
