Text: "Humid as it was, the canopy of trees provided just enough shade for relief\
  \ from the heat. As I walked down the trail in the most beautiful gardens in Singapore,\
  \ I absorbed the glorious sight before me. Sunlight rained down in elegant ribbons\
  \ around me as I watched falling leaves dance in the wind. I began to move faster,\
  \ in efforts to catch up with my father, who had a slight advantage over me because\
  \ of his long legs. I was just a little girl. In my four years I had learned to\
  \ be curious. Constantly walking behind the group, I was always lost in thought.\
  \ On this particular day, I happened to be thinking about my stomach, an entity\
  \ that reigned in my small growing body. I begged my father for an apple from his\
  \ bag. The first juicy bit was pure bliss. Sweet, cool nectar slid down my parched\
  \ throat as I crunched on the puppy flesh. Absorbed in its shiny red exterior, I\
  \ did not notice the local who had descended upon me. Her long arms thick with dark\
  \ hair and beady black eyes stared me directly in the eye. Our heights paralleling\
  \ perfectly, it was as if I was interacting with a human for a split second. That\
  \ is until the coveted fruit was no longer in my possession. This mother had snatched\
  \ what was mine in an attempt to feed her young and keep their safety.\nAll at once\
  \ I stood there baffled like a buffoon. Seconds passed, then minutes before I truly\
  \ realized what had just occurred. The reality that I no longer had the privilege\
  \ of devouring that refreshing fruit on this hot day finally sunk in. I was disappointed.\
  \ \nMy father on the other hand, speechless after what he had just witnessed, had\
  \ other concerns. Sweeping me off my feet, he escorted me away with immense purpose.\
  \ The safety of his young was at risk and he was unwilling to stick around to see\
  \ what might happen next. We sped away into the gardens as the moment became a memory.\
  \ I never will forget that strange encounter with an unlikely local on that summer\
  \ day in Singapore."
