Text: "Like something from a promptly pliable Brian Adam\u2019s song \u2013 it was\
  \ the Summer of \u201917. I was twenty-three and soon to be in love. \nAmidst the\
  \ balayage of idyllic greys and dampened blues that, year-round, litter the canvas\
  \ of Dublin, I met the woman that would change it all.\n                       \
  \  \nGranted, a travel narrative would typically center-on an escape from home -\
  \ but not this one. \nThis was no typical woman and this won\u2019t be a typical\
  \ travel narrative either\u2026 After all, isn\u2019t travel all about exploring\
  \ the atypical?\n \nTogether we frequented Dublin\u2019s finest: the central oasis\
  \ that is St. Stephen\u2019s Green in the raucous red and blood-orange of Autumn;\
  \ New Year's Eve at Custom House Quay; the far flung reaches of D\xFAn Laoghaire\
  \ peer and Killiney beach. The latter resulting in us having to wade through the\
  \ midnight tide to return to the precariously parked car. \n\nKnee-high in water\
  \ and undeterred, we drifted further as if we were on the wave of some cosmic underpinning.\
  \ Dinner, movies, drinks, dancing\u2026 The local felt not-so-local. Thickets of\
  \ green sprung where previously it had been gouged grey.\n\nNot long after, we took\
  \ a trip to Waterford. Despite taking a wrong turn or two on the way down, we were\
  \ firmly on the right roadmap. \nIn Ireland\u2019s Ancient East I felt the stir\
  \ of the most primitive of all emotions: Love. \n\nIt surged me like the mellifluous\
  \ melody of her voice and the daring dance of her eyes so often had before. \nIts\
  \ teeming touch and alluring aura gripped me.  In bated breath I told her. She felt\
  \ the same. \n\nShe is my local connection as we continue to explore Dublin\u2019\
  s inlets and troves; she is my national connection as we are soon to traverse along\
  \ the M9 once more to spend St. Valentines Day in Kilkenny - geographically adjacent\
  \ to the feverishly fond memories of Waterford; she is my soon-to-be international\
  \ connection, as we prepare to digress to the cascading canvass that is Italy\u2019\
  s Amalfi coast.\n \nIt\u2019s now the Spring of \u201918 and the music shows no\
  \ signs of stopping. Long may it continue."
