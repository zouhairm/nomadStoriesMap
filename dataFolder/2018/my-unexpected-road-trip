Text: 'The last thing i expected

  Funny how you can end end up going on a vacation when you least expect it. This
  is my story of how i ended up in the mighty and majestic Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe.i
  have always been interested in traveling and getting to see new sights but i never
  got the opportunity as i am just a small town girl who can hardly afford to spend
  a night in a hotel. Growing up in an African country and being raised in a family
  where my dad was the sole breadwinner holidays were just a dream. Fortunate for
  me i just received a call from one of my friends asking me to accompany her on a
  road trip as her sister had dropped on her at the last minute.i agreed as i had
  nothing to do but i did not know where we where headed. Believe me at that point
  of time in my life the last thing i expected was to be invited to accompany a friend
  on the most expensive road trip i had ever experienced and all expenses were to
  be met by my friend. Our first stop was Hwange National Park were we got to go on
  a game drive and for the first time ever i got to see a lion and elephants up close
  it was the most amazing experience ever.people think that when you stay in africa
  you get to see lions and elephants all day everyday but thats not it we also have
  to visit national parks and most african families really cant afford  such trips.the
  last stop to the road trip was the Victoria falls, its one of the seven wonders
  in the world, i was amazed by the beauty and how huge the falls were.'
