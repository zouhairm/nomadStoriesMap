Text: "\"Should we turn back?\" My friend's hesitation to answer confirmed that we\
  \ were both equally doubting our spur of the moment detour. The local taxi driver\
  \ had insisted that we couldn't leave San Agustin without visiting 'La Chaquira'.\
  \ The site is accessible only by foot and after walking for 40 minutes along a desolate\
  \ dirt track in an exhausting heat, we were almost ready to admit defeat. We agreed\
  \ to continue for 10 minutes more and then, as if by magic, a sign appeared. \n\n\
  Everything about the San Agustin Archaelogical site in Colombia is a mystery. Over\
  \ 500 abandoned statues of mythical creatures and gods have been re-discovered and\
  \ it is believed that they were carved mainly between 50 and 400AD. They are the\
  \ remnants of an imaginative and creative lost civilisation who left behind a legacy\
  \ which we know very little about. \n\nWith minimal background knowledge I visited\
  \ La Chaquira open-minded, but the reality of the site was still the last thing\
  \ that I expected.  \n\nThe panoramic views over the Magdalena Canyon are simply\
  \ breath taking. The landscape is virtually unchanged in thousands of years and\
  \ the tranquillity was so extraordinary that I found myself almost paralysed with\
  \ a need to savour the experience for a while before I even considered taking any\
  \ photographs. With a complete disregard to the supposed main attraction of the\
  \ rock carving, we lay down on the wooden planks soaking up the energy whilst completely\
  \ alone in this very special place. They say that magical realism was born in Colombia.\
  \ After visiting San Agustin I do not doubt this for one second. \n\nThere are various\
  \ theories regarding the significance of the rock carving. Some suggest that the\
  \ figure's arms are raised upwards as if praising the Sun and that this location\
  \ was historically used as an observation spot. Personally, I see the figure to\
  \ be meditating, soaking up the spiritual energy present here and enjoying the spectacular\
  \ view. Perhaps the figure was carved here by someone who, just like me, felt compelled\
  \ to make an expression of their own experience in this extraordinary place.   \n\
  \nI never expected that the emotions evoked from a location could be more impressionable\
  \ than any historical artefact. It cost us nothing but a little intrepidity to visit\
  \ La Chaquira yet the experience was priceless. I left with a heap of unanswered\
  \ questions and a severe lack of facts, but with an unexpected knowledge and understanding\
  \ of this magical place."
