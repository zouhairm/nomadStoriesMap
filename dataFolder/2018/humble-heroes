Text: "Hurdling over pot holes and evading cow calamities, my fine ideals of comfort\
  \ were momentarily placed aside. As we manoeuvred in miraculous ways, the built-in\
  \ stereo of the rickshaw crackled aloud, in the attempt to drown out an unglamorous\
  \ engine blare. Approaching the Macheda district, in Jaipur, Rajasthan, tiny legs\
  \ ran beside as I slowly reached a halt. Though my last day at the street school\
  \ has sadly arrived, each welcome remained like the first.\n\nScrambling for their\
  \ books, five little children sat eagerly, ready to scrawl down from the board.\n\
  \u201CA for Aeroplane,\u201D I said. Tiny hands began to take off in the mimic of\
  \ soaring flights.\n\nWhat must it be like to fly up so high, how must it feel?\
  \ They seemed to wonder. I sighed. Perhaps they might never know.\n\nAs the fascination\
  \ for flying soon faded, there was silence in the room. I drifted back in recollection\
  \ of my month in Jaipur gone by.\n\nWandering through the majestic Pink City, I\
  \ sat between the enchanting walls of Nahargarh Fort, ready to watch the sunset.\
  \ The most romantic place in Jaipur, they said. I looked out to rest my gaze upon\
  \ a panoramic view of the city. Pink hues of the royal ruins merged into a dusky\
  \ amber sky. They were right, I wondered; the setting was so romantic, that the\
  \ view I began to romanticise. Sitting within the grandeur of the fort I started\
  \ to evade the intricate city that really lay beneath. The little district of Macheda\
  \ disappeared into the vastness of Jaipur\u2019s royal resonance.\n\nThe classroom\
  \ was quiet; five small faces urged me to continue.\n\n\u201CB for?\u201D I asked.\
  \ Their hands wavered up in excitement.\n\n\u201CB for Boy!\u201D Raghu shouted,\
  \ as his classmates echoed his answer. Stunting himself in a comedic display, laughter\
  \ spread through the room. He shouted again, as they pointed to one another in excitement.\
  \ Following his dictation with my chalk on the board, a look of pride struck across\
  \ his face. Scribbling down into their books, they smiled so wide, that from A for\
  \ Aeroplane, to B for Boy, a simple truth then struck. \n\nIt\u2019s neither what\
  \ they have nor lack, that makes their world any less; but innocent assurance and\
  \ pride in who they are, makes it all the more.\n\nI took off my rose tinted glasses.\
  \ The Pink City rid itself of its monochromatic name. What a city this is, I wondered.\
  \ Where from the tops of Nahargarh, I saw only royal resonance; but from the depths\
  \ of the Macheda district, I found its humble heroes. I smiled. But perhaps they\
  \ already know."
