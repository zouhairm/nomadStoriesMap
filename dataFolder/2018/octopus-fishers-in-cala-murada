Text: "The waves lapped playfully around my ankles as I squinted over the white sand\
  \ dunes of Cala Murada. A single white cloud drifted slowly across the azure sky,\
  \ and the wind playfully kicked up the sand. I could see, over one tall hill, the\
  \ appartment number 46 nestled beside of a rocky cliff. I turned to the water which\
  \ casted a green glow onto the sand, and I ran deeper into the ocean where the weight\
  \ of the water pulled on my legs until I had to leap in head first to continue forward.\
  \ The water was cool and it soothed my red skin, but it burned my eyes when I opened\
  \ them. It was silent under the water except for the gentle rustling of waves above\
  \ my head which rocked me slowly to and fro. I pushed hard on the soft ground and\
  \ emerged in a crash of water to don my goggles and snorkel. I pressed my face once\
  \ again into the water, my breathing became heavier, and I could hear the gentle\
  \ rustling again. I floated there, gazing down at the colors of light the waves\
  \ painted onto the sand. I swam over to the cliff face slowly, watching as the curious\
  \ organisms of the sea bustled past, always in a hurry to get somewhere. I saw the\
  \ glint of a shell that played beautifully in the sun, I took a deep gulp of breath,\
  \ and I swam down to touch it. Bubbles drifted noisily to the surface as I breathed\
  \ out slowly. I picked up the source of the strange light, a thin shell no longer\
  \ than the palm of my hand and gazed at it long enough to almost forget about the\
  \ gallons of water above my head. I swam towards the surface and broke through again,\
  \ proud of my amazing find. When I did, I noticed two other divers near the rocks.\
  \ They had long Spears and oxygen tanks and they sank quickly under the surface.\
  \ I submerged myself again and I saw the last thing I expected. Eight red limbs\
  \ flailed angrily at the aggressors in a cloud of ink and blood below the surface.\
  \ The man who\u2019s spear had impaled the creature fought rigorously to keep his\
  \ hold on it and it spat dark ink and blood back at him. The second man\u2019s spear\
  \ flew swiftly and silently threw the water, and, upon impact, the tentacles stopped\
  \ flailing. They had slain the octopus. A grand battle, knights against a dragon,\
  \ had taken place just below the reflective surface, but the English-speaking, sunscreen-bathed\
  \ tourists on the beach we\u2019re none the wiser. They only watched two Spaniards\
  \ emerge from the water with eight limp tentacles on the end of one of their silver\
  \ spears."
