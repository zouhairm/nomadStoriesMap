Text: "Zoe and I set out on a journey across the US with fierce eagerness. Naive and\
  \ only nineteen, we thought we\u2019d encounter individuals who could help us escape\
  \ the clogged minds that a London upbringing had given us.\nWe stayed with characters\
  \ across Milwaukie, Chicago and Memphis but our most memorable connection was when\
  \ we were rescued from a couchsurfer in Memphis. This time a problematic Pizza delivery\
  \ guy who failed to alert us to tornado warnings and with whom we spent a stormy\
  \ evening watching The Twilight Zone. Zoe and I felt zoned out ourselves and were\
  \ relieved that our next host was a friend of Zoe\u2019s neighbour.\nRon picked\
  \ us up in his beaten up Ford. He was shorter than I imagined, wore a beige linen\
  \ shirt, mardi gras beads around his neck and trainers reminiscent of Cica ones\
  \ worn by 90s children in sports class. His hair was wispy. He had a kind expression\
  \ and I felt safe shuffling into the car. As the engine started so did the Afrobeat.\
  \ Ron filled us in on the tornado damage, pointing out the high levels of the river.\
  \ Our first stop was Costco, where he explained he liked to go for lunch sometimes.\
  \ By lunch he meant perusing the aisles until you came to a try before you buy display.\
  \ We stocked up on samples of crackers and cheese, thimbles of organic apple juice\
  \ and broken pieces of fair trade chocolate. This was humbling and not dissimilar\
  \ to something I\u2019d have done back home, although not in the company of others.\n\
  We arrived at Ron\u2019s bungalow in the literary town of Oxford, Mississippi. By\
  \ this time we had an idea of what he did, drive writers around as they toured the\
  \ south with their latest publications, and what he\u2019d done in the past, run\
  \ an arthouse cinema in the 60\u2019s, been an activist for human rights, lectured\
  \ around Oxford. His digs demonstrated the vastness of his life and the busyness\
  \ inside his head. In short, he was a hoarder. However, he\u2019d cleared a pathway\
  \ for us.\nVenturing out for dinner it was clear Ron was admired in Oxford. He adored\
  \ soul music and was personable to everyone. We spent afternoons attending readings\
  \ at Off Square Books, and nights watching blues at The Blind Pig, where locals\
  \ guzzled smoked pastrami hoagies. We enjoyed sweet potato casserole sprinkled with\
  \ mini marshmallows at Ajax Diner, on Courthouse Square, where William Faulkner\
  \ thought and wrote in the 1920s. \nThe town was updated with modern outlets and\
  \ salons that wouldn\u2019t have fit in a Faulkner novel yet Ron was a protagonist\
  \ for an intriguing tale."
