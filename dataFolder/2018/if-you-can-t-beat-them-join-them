Text: "December 19th, 2017 I set off on a trip that would broaden my horizens in every\
  \ single aspect. I decided to backpack across Europe alone. Money was a bit short\
  \ and I had to do what every backpacker does, rough it. I started in Amsterdam and\
  \ made my way down to Budapest to ring in the New Year. Every hostel was a different\
  \ experience, but pretty clean and comfortable. By the time I reached Budapest the\
  \ only thing I wanted to do was rest. I had lost all interest in celebrating the\
  \ New Year, I was exhausted. As I walked to the hostel, I thought \u201CI\u2019\
  m just going to stay in, relax, have some food and kick back\u201D, boy was I wrong.\
  \ I followed the directions the the hostel and I approached what looked like an\
  \ abandoned building. All of the windows had wooden boards nailed down covering\
  \ them and graffitti covered the walls. I thought \u201CIt must be here\u201D, and\
  \ laughed while I looked for the hostel. When suddenly I see a sign on the wooden\
  \ door. To my surprise, that was the hostel where I was going to be staying at.\
  \ I started laughing out loud, what else could I do. I rang the doorbell and someone\
  \ opened the gate. I was not prepared for what I was about to see. The yard was\
  \ full of trees. Braws, underwear and shoes hung from the branches; graffitti covered\
  \ everything in sight, even the trees. I was greeted by a guy who looked as if he\
  \ had been run over bu a truck. As he checked me in the only thing he could talk\
  \ about was how drunk he had gotten the night before. He gave me a tour of the place,\
  \ the first room he took me to was the \u201CAnal Room\u201D. He explained that\
  \ the room was a party room where one could do whatever they wished, so if I arrived\
  \ and someone was having sex I could either join them or ignore them. The room looked\
  \ like an abandoned shack in a slum somewhere in Brazil where the police don\u2019\
  t even bother going. Next he took me to my room. The front door and bathroom doors\
  \ didn\u2019t lock and there were no lockers. The room was never cleaned, the only\
  \ thing they did was change the sheets and stock up on toilet paper. The foul smell\
  \ that was that room was something tou couldn\u2019t get used to. I had no other\
  \ option but to stay there. I was tired and yearning for a relaxing time, I wound\
  \ up at a party hostel instead. I went out for a meal and to think about what my\
  \ next step was going to be. The last thing I expected to be going through was happening\
  \ at that moment, so I decided to follow the motto \u201CIf you can\u2019t beat\
  \ them, join them\u201D."
