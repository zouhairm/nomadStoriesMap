Text: "I was newly get out of bed, still with bleary eyes, when I crowned the dune\
  \ from which I was going to enjoy the spectacular sunrise that the desert had proposed\
  \ to give me that day.\nI prognosticated that it would be a hot day, almost suffocating.\
  \ However, nothing made me predict that this heat would be stifled by the surprise\
  \ that the fate had prepared for me.\nAfter a quiet and pleasant morning, the time\
  \ came. It was time to taste a delicious couscous with vegetables, cooked with love\
  \ by expert hands, accompanied by a delicious \u201CBerber whiskey\u201D (Moroccan\
  \ tea). A delicacy!\nDuring my evening walk, nearly by chance, I was involved in\
  \ a Berber wedding. Ahmed and Naima. Or Said and Samira? Their names did not matter.\
  \ I was their guest of honour.\nThis Berber ritual prolongs for three days; they\
  \ were celebrating the third.\nThe bride wore a white dress, with a red hood covering\
  \ her face. The newlyweds wore floral-themed tattoos on feet and hands, painted\
  \ with henna. It was easy to deduce that it had been a beautiful job done with great\
  \ care.\nThe guests, relatives and friends were of all ages, but there was something\
  \ common to all of them: they belonged to the same race, community, social status.\
  \ And of course, they all had deep dark eyes, which transmitted the way of being\
  \ of those people: free men, nomads.\nFrom time to time I could feel sidelong glances\
  \ on me, full of curiosity and a little shy. \nAt that moment I was the different\
  \ one, the strange one; nevertheless, I felt welcomed, as one more.\nFor the occasion,\
  \ the couple had sacrificed a lamb, following the tradition. They offered to try\
  \ it; I could not refuse it. It was cooked in a way that I had never tasted. The\
  \ mother of the bride confessed to me the secret of the recipe; but I can not tell\
  \ it, it is still a secret!\nWithout knowing how, maybe letting me flow, I was dancing\
  \ to the rhythm of drums, played by callused hands, a sign of the hardness of daily\
  \ work. The drums were accompanied by Berber screams, whose meaning I did not need\
  \ to understand.\nBefore sundown the bride discovered her face to all those present.\
  \ The initial silence became a sound of admiration and joy.\nHusband and wife looked\
  \ at each other and it seemed to me that this love would last a lifetime.\nThe moment\
  \ was full of magic and mystery, but it was not a desert mirage. I knew I was witnessing\
  \ something unique. The day had given me the opportunity to live \u201Cthe last\
  \ thing I expected\u201D."
