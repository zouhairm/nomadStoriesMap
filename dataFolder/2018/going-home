Text: "Drakas. As if we were driving though the set for Captain Corelli\u2019s Mandolin,\
  \ crowds of roses surrounded the tiny doorways of the ancient cottages. The quiet\
  \ music from the tavernas near the shore seemed another world away.\n\nKostas still\
  \ slept on. Kiki began the steep climb up the hill towards home, her sandals crackling\
  \ against the chalk. I followed. Late evening, the village of Drakas was peaceful.\
  \ The noise of  zizigis created a dull hum in the air. I wandered up the hill, as\
  \ my eyes drunk in the dying sun beside the mountains; a rich array of orange, pink\
  \ and red hues against an indigo silhouette.\n\nWe passed Maurice, a neighbour,\
  \ on our way up to the house. The rich scent of olives was wonderfully fragrant\
  \ as we approached his orchard. Maurice looked the same as usual. He wore his old,\
  \ threadbare t-shirt and a cap, which was printed with \u2018REECE\u2019 after the\
  \ \u2018G\u2019 had worn away. His hands had wine red Zakynthian soil so deeply\
  \ ingrained into the creases of his knuckles and palms, it looked as if it would\
  \ never wash away.\n\n\u201CYeia sas!\u201D Maurice exclaimed. We exchanged greeting\
  \ verbally, but the slow, lazy nature of Island life meant that there were no shaking\
  \ of hands or embraces. He and my step mother spoke for a while, until a noisy squawk\
  \ interrupted the river of words. \n\nThe baby bird had awoken. His large brown\
  \ eyes searched the scene before him, and it became apparent he was unhappy to be\
  \ away from home. Thus, my little brother scrunched up his face like a dried up\
  \ prune and let out long wail.\n\nAt this convenient moment, Maurice excused himself\
  \ and waddled quickly, with a big stick in aid of his pursuit, back to his house.\
  \ Kiki cooed and soothed with gentle sounds, like the music slowing down before\
  \ the end of the song. Kostas settled, and we walked quickly up the hill towards\
  \ home, leaving the clustered, quiet household behind.\n\nAfter the arduous, hilly\
  \ trek, I finally saw the house, peeping over the top of a clan of lemon trees that\
  \ danced in the breeze. The house grew and grew the closer we got. As we were finally\
  \ within ten feet, the faint scratching of the thatched roof could be heard as the\
  \ breeze whizzed through the dry straw.\n\n\u201CElla!\u201D my grandmother yelled,\
  \ beckoning over the clatter of a pan falling to the floor in the kitchen. As Kiki\
  \ took Kostas to resume his slumber, I wandered into the kitchen. I smiled when\
  \ I saw the feta cheese and the cucumber, but it was the scent of the earth and\
  \ the brine that made desire pool into my mouth.\n\nOlives."
