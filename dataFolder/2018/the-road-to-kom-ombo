Text: "It is a long drive to Kom Ombo from Luxor. Flanked by the fertile Nile valley,\
  \ my driver Aslam\u2019s Peugot hums and sputters incessantly, the crunching of\
  \ rocks and the spewing of coarse sand whipping up dust in front and behind us.\
  \ Carts piled high with green stalks of sugar cane fall behind us, their donkeys\
  \ often in a laborious gallop, others trotting leisurely. Nothing jerks or juts\
  \ out suddenly, save the occasional security checkpoint or speed bump, poorly marked\
  \ by recycled tires wrapped around bent and rusty poles.\n\nWe stop to pick up Aslam\u2019\
  s friend Charley. At least I think that\u2019s his name. They were good friends\
  \ in Luxor. \n\n\u201CThis is my mother\u2019s house.\u201D We enter a cool, cramped\
  \ foyer, faced with a grey concrete staircase and a floorless back room carpeted\
  \ with tufts of grass peeking out from cracks in the floorboards and the stony heaps\
  \ of earth.\n\n\u201CPlease,\u201D Charley pats my back and leads me into a cool,\
  \ small room with a bed, table, and disassembled motorcycle piled on a sideboard\
  \ in the corner.\n\n\u201CVery nice, you can tell your mother,\u201D I compliment\
  \ him.\n\n\u201CShe passed,\u201D I apologize but Charley continues nonchalantly,\
  \ \u201CI come. Have a beer when wife sleeps or children sleep. Smoke and eat, play\
  \ cards.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat my baby! You like?\u201D He points to the skeleton\
  \ of the motorcycle. \u201CDuring nice weather I put back together and ride.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBut it\u2019s nice now!\u201D I counter, Aslam laughs.\n\n\u201CHe say\
  \ you say that about every summer!\u201D We all laugh. It\u2019s a good laugh, one\
  \ that bridges material desires of freedom and the frustrations of never quite realizing\
  \ them.\n\nWe begin eating as Aslam talks of the benefits of Egyptian bread. \u201C\
  Here, this is yours, laying a massive chicken breast on my plate.\n\n\u201CWhat\
  \ do you do, Charley?\u201D I ask. He hadn\u2019t mentioned anything of work before.\n\
  \n\u201CI run shop in Luxor.\u201D He spreads hummus on his bread before cutting\
  \ a piece of kofta with his plastic knife and then wrapping it around the lamb meat.\
  \ \u201CBut I have to close. The tourists. They stop.\u201D Emboldened by the cool\
  \ shade of his home away from home he continues, \u201CWhy? Why they no come?\u201D\
  \n\nThere isn\u2019t much else to say. \u201CI guess people are afraid.\u201D \n\
  \n\u201CI know. They stop. They stop it all.\u201D\n\nHe rolls a cigarette which\
  \ he and Aslam share. Aslam almost never has his own cigarettes.\n\nI open a beer\
  \ as the two smoke, the room growing hazy from the descending angle of the late\
  \ afternoon sun. \n\n\u201CI hope.\u201D\n\n\u201CThat\u2019s all you can do.\u201D"
