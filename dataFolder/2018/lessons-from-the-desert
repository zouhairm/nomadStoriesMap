Text: "\u201CAt night, when you go to the village, you find kids dancing to the folklore\u2026\
  \ and probably, some have not had supper.\u201D\nThe sun rises\u2014blood red every\
  \ morning\u2014torching the barren land for an even twelve hours and dousing itself\
  \ in the cool water of the lake every evening. The village of Ileret lies in the\
  \ Turkana desert in northwestern Kenya, east of Lake Turkana. The locals, primarily\
  \ Daasanach, live in huts of acacia and scrap metal, symbolic of their relatively\
  \ recent transition from a nomadic lifestyle. These quaint half-domes litter the\
  \ landscape as you near the village, where they become increasingly dense. Stooping\
  \ through the two-foot entrance, the tiny metal dome transforms into a spacious\
  \ and cooled room. Woven storage racks line the walls and ceiling, leaving the rug-covered\
  \ floor clutter-free\u2014the room is immaculate, far cleaner than most American\
  \ households where storage space is abundant. There is no electricity, but boiling\
  \ black tea is poured fresh from the family thermos. Samaki, freshly fried fish\
  \ from the lake, is offered. The room is dimly lit: light seeps in from between\
  \ the edges of the scrap metal, and under the walls, which are not quite flush with\
  \ the desert floor. \nOver tea and fish, we talk. Mostly, I listen. The Daasanach\
  \ are deeply connected with the land. Their survival is tied to their herds of cattle\
  \ and goats, to the rains coming when expected, to the lake not shrinking too far\
  \ inland. The massive Omo dams being built in Ethiopia spell an uncertain, and harsh,\
  \ future. \nThough English is an official language in Kenya, it is not necessarily\
  \ ubiquitous. Football is. First we played football, then we watched it, then the\
  \ walls of language and culture came crashing down and friendships were built in\
  \ their place. Through long conversations and quick observations from the back of\
  \ a bumpy lorry, I saw that happiness, too, is ubiquitous and walks hand-in-hand\
  \ with human resiliency. Their schools don\u2019t have air conditioning, they play\
  \ soccer barefoot, on dirt, rocks, and thorns, and begin herding goats at age seven.\
  \ Yet the more I got to know them, the more we were the same. A landscape charred\
  \ and desolate teems with ambition, community, gratitude, hospitality, hope. Humanity.\
  \ A family, desperate for rain, welcomes a mzungu, foreigner, with tea and fish.\
  \ \n\u201CHappiness is human beings appreciating each other.\u201D"
