Text: "Mumbai, a lot has been written and rewritten about this City of Dreams. Everybody\
  \ falls in love with this city or so it is said. How did I join the crowd of millions\
  \ who share an unshakable love for this place driven by dreams, love, and money?\
  \ \n\nDavid Gregory Roberts in his book \u2018Shantaram\u2019 said, \u201CIt's the\
  \ smell of gods, demons, empires, and civilizations in resurrection and decay. It's\
  \ the blue skin-smell of the sea, no matter where you are in the Island City, and\
  \ the blood-metal smell of machines. It smells of the stir and sleep and waste of\
  \ sixty million animals, more than half of them humans and rats.\u201D  There are\
  \ no better words to describe the poverty, pollution and the population of Mumbai.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s home to almost 18 million people but it never fails to seize your excitement,\
  \ no matter how many times you visit it. You start craving pani puri from the Chowpatty\
  \ once you are away. No street food will suffice your taste buds after you\u2019\
  ve eaten Mumbai\u2019s authentic Pav Bhaji, served with a spoonful of butter on\
  \ top.\n\nYou always manage to end up on its coast and every night, it urges you\
  \ to take a stroll on best sea face of Mumbai, Marine Drive. The magnificently lit\
  \ up Sophia Hospital to Adani\u2019s hoarding, everything is pretty from there.\
  \ The majestic Antilla draws your attention with every glance at the sky. Night\
  \ skies are filled with airplanes and helicopters yet you make a wish anyway, hoping\
  \ it was a shooting star.\n\nMarine drive can always be complemented by visiting\
  \ Colaba. Every sea breeze that hits your face in Mumbai, gives you the comfort\
  \ of home. If you\u2019re a believer in retail therapy, Causeway becomes your paradise.\n\
  To wind up all the budgeted shopping, Starbucks on the corner or Leopold\u2019s\
  \ on the Causeway is perfect.\n\nThere\u2019s a popular saying in Mumbai, \u201C\
  If you cannot find it anywhere, you\u2019ll find it in Chor Bazar!\u201D The market\
  \ spread across various parallel streets takes you into a completely different Mumbai.\
  \  \nMost of my time in Mumbai, I spent walking on Marine Drive from Nariman Point.\
  \ Mumbai Local rides from Churchgate to Lower Parel or Dadar was equally mesmerizing\
  \ as on the Sealink. I called South Bombay my home and the rest of it my muse. I\
  \ was so similar to all those people there and yet, so different. I have never felt\
  \ anything like that before.\n\nBollywood calls it home. So does business, crime\
  \ and fashion. Everybody eventually falls in love with the Financial Capital of\
  \ India. Everybody eventually calls Mumbai home. Because, it is."
