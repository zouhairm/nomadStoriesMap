Text: "A decision that pushed me to the edge!\nI wasn\u2019t happy. That realisation\
  \ hit me one morning. Something was missing - I had a save job, my own apartment,\
  \ nice colleagues & friends but still, I wasn\u2019t happy. Nearly 2 years went\
  \ by until it hit me again. I can still remember it clearly\u2014 it was one of\
  \ those unusual sunny days we do not have a lot of up in north Germany, from where\
  \ I am. I was lying in my parents garden, reading a book and suddenly this idea\
  \ popped up in my head: I want travel around the world!\nSo long story short - I\
  \ worked my ass off for another year, saved money for the flight ticket, a health\
  \ insurance, a little back up for my apartment, applied for work and travel visas\
  \ in Canada, New Zealand & Australia, hit rock bottom due to sheer exhaustion, got\
  \ back up, ditched some false friends along the way, quite my job, disappointed\
  \ my parents in doing so, managed to rent my apartment out super last minute and\
  \ was gone!\nThe other thing I can remember as it was yesterday was sitting in the\
  \ plan to Vancouver and crying happy tears! Feeling that a heavy weight coming off\
  \ my shoulders and sitting there in sheer disbelieve that I\u2019ve really really\
  \ done it! My round the world trip had just started!\nWhat should I say - I never\
  \ ever regreted my decision. I met some amazing people along the way and these memories\
  \ will stay with me forever and I am forever grateful for all of them! The good\
  \ and the not so good ones!"
