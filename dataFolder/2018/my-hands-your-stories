Text: "That's me, I'm seeing myself when I was little. I'm with that obsession again.\
  \ When I was a little girl, I used to touch the older building's facade while I\
  \ was walking. I imagined that my hands were wandering that house's story. My fingers\
  \ tripped in every breach of the wall, but then, they started their way in each\
  \ window sill again. When I turned the corner and the house ends, I looked my dirty\
  \ and injured fingers. The more damaged skin, the longer and greater was the route.\
  \ I can almost hear my mum shouting to me and brings me back to the reality.\n\n\
  \u201CAllegra, wake up! She must feel dizzy...\u201D, cried a voice.\n\nThat is\
  \ not my mum's voice, it has a foreign accent, it's a harsh english, like that who\
  \ try to seems native and he exaggerates it until he sounds contrived. I can open\
  \ my eyes and I only see some colours, bright colours. I just realized. Congo. But\
  \ that pain comes back. My finger. And that vision again: my hands, the facade,\
  \ my mum... Twenty years later, I'm thousand of miles from that old facade, too\
  \ far away, but I feel the same pain and it takes me back to that moment.\n\n\u201C\
  Look at her hands...\u201D, I'm listening that harsh english again.\n\nYes, they\
  \ are still injured. I would like to answer that they are not just wounds, but also\
  \ memories. They are moments with each people who share his story with me, but I\
  \ try to open my eyes and I feel dizzy. Then, when I'm going to come back to my\
  \ childhood, I feel a gentle caress on my thumb creased, and I think about that\
  \ old woman from Marrakech who, like a symbol of hospitality, invites me to her\
  \ home, where I tasted the best mint tea of the country, as good as hot...\n\nNowadays,\
  \ I think and I guess that, when I was little, that injured hands were just trying\
  \ to prepare for the uniques and personal stories that come to me. Now, the building's\
  \ facade becomes people with a real life stories. My hands don't have space for\
  \ more memories, each person has built the story of each travel. \n\nI open my eyes.\
  \ \n\n\u201CAre you ok? You were playing the drums with the little boy and a snake\
  \ bites your hand...\u201D, says that harsh accent while she is scrubbing with mud\
  \ my index finger.\n\nIt will be a new memory soon. A story.\n\nA person."
