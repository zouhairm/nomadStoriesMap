Text: "Easter Island is rarely referred to as a paradise, it is rather a mystery.\
  \ For the rest of the world this island with unclear location is home to the silent\
  \ stone giants. Many travelers find it too boring, too small, too secluded, or too\
  \ expensive. It might be tricky to enjoy.\nRapa Nui \u2013 the indigenous name of\
  \ the island \u2013 kept its authenticity, staying undiscovered for many centuries.\
  \ I knew I was in the most remote place on Earth the moment I entered its bungalow-style\
  \ airport. There is only one gas station on the island, two small supermarkets,\
  \ and very often no internet connection. Beautiful Rapanui people wear flowers in\
  \ their hair, drink fruity cocktails, smile happily, and radiate satisfaction.\n\
  For the urban residents this flare of laziness and detachment may seem irritating,\
  \ not to mention deadly dull. The best you can do is surrender. Every day I floated\
  \ among eucalyptus groves and sunny beaches, sunsets and sunrises, hikes and rides,\
  \ extinct volcanoes and ancient secrets. Every day spent here kept me in a state\
  \ of blissful admiration for the people, the nature, the food, the way of living.\n\
  In relaxation and serenity of the island it took me a while to notice the persistent\
  \ sound of siren one day. My husband and I decided to take a stroll to the seaside\
  \ just to find out that the whole area was surrounded by the police. A tall topless\
  \ local man emerged from the darkness and, glancing with white teeth, explained\
  \ in a mix of Spanish and French that Chile was struck by a strong earthquake, followed\
  \ by a tsunami warning on the island. All residents and guests were urged to gather\
  \ at the airport or outside the church \u2013 the highest points in the island\u2019\
  s only town Hanga Roa. I looked around and saw no signs of panic or hurry.\n\u201C\
  Is it obligatory?\u201D \u2013 I asked. \u201CDo you want to live?\u201D \u2013\
  \ the man smiled. Still incredulous, we picked our valuables, grabbed Pisco Sour,\
  \ and went to the church.\nAll the young people were already there, laughing, playing\
  \ guitar, drinking, and having an exceptionally fun evening. We lied on the grass\
  \ and watched unbelievably close stars, listened to that guitar, reflecting. I couldn\u2019\
  t have imagined that waiting for a tsunami would be so pacifying and festive. Half\
  \ a Pisco Sour bottle later, we got tired and went home to sleep.\nTsunami never\
  \ came, as it didn\u2019t come many times before. The tragic events of the big world\
  \ across the ocean echoed here that day, but somehow they transformed into something\
  \ unifying, cheerful, and enjoyable."
