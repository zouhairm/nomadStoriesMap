Text: "The least I expected my heart to be out of the calendar, the least I expected\
  \ was to take a notebook and a pencil and write each step, I do not want anyone\
  \ to tag my steps, I'm helmsman of my own boat, of my own heart, do not have a path\
  \ or way to know new cultures and love stories. Walking through the houses and touching\
  \ them imagining how life revolves like a whirlpool, although there are stops before\
  \ my destination I won\u2019t forget my roots, the last I expected that there\u2019\
  s farewells that I never allow because you just have to live without understanding\
  \ life, you just have to live without anything changing, just don\u2019t expect\
  \ life to give you. The last I expected was to sit down for tea in the streets of\
  \ San Juan, the last I expected was to drive an hour to greet someone, the last\
  \ I expected was to be a woman with a desire to know someone's smile, ask her about\
  \ her roots . The last thing I expected was that I would fall in love with broken\
  \ people to heal their wounds as if they were crystals, I study medicine but that\
  \ does not mean that I love broken people, life keeps giving lessons but I learned\
  \ to love myself sometimes, what last I was hoping too long for a cup of tea in\
  \ a country without even knowing its streets. I get lost in every corner of the\
  \ world trying to get the best out of me, but who was going to tell me that paradise\
  \ is not in the world, this is the last thing you expected, the unexpected is extraordinary.\
  \ In San Juan there is a man who is called the \"Grandfather of the sea\" since\
  \ he lives near the sea, he told me \"The least you expected was to fall in love\
  \ with the world and not with the people.\" And totally agree, the least I expected\
  \ was live counting my days to wait for the \"love of my life\" when the \"love\
  \ of my life\" is me. The last thing I expected in life was \"I love you\" of the\
  \ person who broke me but trotting worlds I am thanks to that break ... I can\u2019\
  t believe it, when there was no fear, I want to drink, dance, mourn for the losses\
  \ in the world but God tells me \"keep writing about me.\" The least I expected\
  \ was to sing to people I do not know but who applaud me, I want to sing to the\
  \ world, dedicate their songs to their roots and dedicate a flower to each widow\
  \ who lost there love. The last thing I expect from me is to write on each page\
  \ \"I do not know where I am, but I'll get there.\" The last thing I expect is that\
  \ I find myself drinking tea in an unknown country, writing my crazy stories and\
  \ divine stories. That\u2019s the last thing I expect."
