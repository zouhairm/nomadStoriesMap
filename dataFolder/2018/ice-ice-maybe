Text: "Arriving at the Icehotel, I am awed by its scale; an iconic marvel of organic\
  \ engineering. \nMy husband and I are exploring the wilds of northern Sweden and\
  \ tonight, for one night only, we have blown the budget to stay on a slab of ice.\
  \ Meticulous planning has involved digesting countless reviews of the world\u2019\
  s original igloo-inspired hotel, all extolling the virtues of sub zero slumber.\
  \  Hundreds of former residents claim that the reward for bedding down here is the\
  \ perfect night\u2019s sleep. So many people cannot be wrong. \nAs I struggle to\
  \ open the door of our Volvo hire car against a sharp blast of -15\xB0C wind, I\
  \ secretly hope that it is warmer inside than out. Perhaps it\u2019s too tough to\
  \ call. \nTen hours later, raw air stabbing my exposed face, I have my answer. As\
  \ in all relationships, there are winners and losers. It\u2019s my turn to be defeated\
  \ in the bedroom battle; the sleeping bag tug of war.  Extreme cold has pushed me\
  \ to my limits and I can stand it no longer. Suddenly, I remember the en suite bathroom.\
  \ I have found my exit strategy. \nCocooned in both of our arctic coats, I stir\
  \ hours later to vague murmurings coming from the bedroom. The voices are oddly\
  \ muffled due to the spacecraft inspired air lock that has, pleasingly, barricaded\
  \ out the cold. Unaware of my nocturnal defection in favour of warmer climes, my\
  \ husband is surprised to be awoken by a polite Lapp, offering a tonic of lingonberry\
  \ juice. \n\u201CWho are you?\u201D I hear him say. \u201CAnd what have you done\
  \ with my wife?\u201D\nLater, an enthusiastic receptionist asks if we enjoyed our\
  \ stay. \n\u201CWonderful, thank you.\u201D I find myself lying under the duress\
  \ of forced British politeness. \u201CThe best night\u2019s sleep of my life.\u201D\
  \nMy embarrassment is compounded by the well-meaning yet shameful presentation of\
  \ a certificate, confirming our membership of an elite club of intrepid travellers\
  \ who have survived the night. \nLaughing, we return to the car, only to be greeted\
  \ by an alarming sight. In our haste the previous afternoon, we failed to consider\
  \ a bottle of carbonated water, carelessly left in the drinks holder next to my\
  \ sunglasses. Plummeting overnight temperatures have caused the glass to shatter\
  \ and a violent explosion; a now frozen mass, holding my eyewear captive. \nA few\
  \ days on, I recount \u201CIcegate\u201D to a friend who finds the sorry saga rather\
  \ amusing. \u201CMy neighbours had no windows in the upstairs of their house for\
  \ years. They were freezing... for free. You paid for the privilege!\u201D \nI simply\
  \ cannot argue with that."
