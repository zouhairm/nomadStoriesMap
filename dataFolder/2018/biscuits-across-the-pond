Text: "The dark Italian river flowed past, stars tangled in its waters. A lost soccer\
  \ ball floated near the edge and David grabbed it, shaking it dry and dropping it\
  \ to the ground. My red-wine lips smiled, the world turning around me as we ran\
  \ like children, kicking the waterlogged ball back and forth. Monica and Brian were\
  \ a few feet behind us, occasionally cheering or yelling offenses at us based on\
  \ our soccer skills. \nSoon after, when our lungs were tight from running, one of\
  \ my violent kicks sent it sailing into the water. I nearly fell in, desperate to\
  \ bring it back. David grabbed my arm and pulled me up in time, the current carrying\
  \ the ball out of sight. \n I didn\u2019t want the night to end. I didn\u2019t want\
  \ Rome to end. It had been a miracle when I booked my ticket in the first place\
  \ and it had turned into more of a walking dream than my reality. Had it really\
  \ only been three weeks ago that I\u2019d bought the ticket? \n So instead of running,\
  \ walked with staggering, languid steps on the river\u2019s edge. White twinkle\
  \ lights gleamed ahead of us, luring us towards the party on the river. From far\
  \ away we could hear laughter and conversations, a hum of various languages and\
  \ lives swirling together. I wanted to run ahead, to throw myself into the middle\
  \ of the noise. But I also wanted to stay in the shadows, my hand trailing along\
  \ the giant stone wall, a thin layer of moss and graffiti covering it, memorizing\
  \ what Rome felt like beneath my fingertips."
