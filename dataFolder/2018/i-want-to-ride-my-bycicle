Text: "Cars honk behind me, a strange buzzing overtakes the air like a swarm of angry\
  \ bees, and my instinct is to duck and look behind me. As silly as I look in that\
  \ moment I am hardly the most interesting thing on the street. Leaning over the\
  \ handlebars, bare breasts sway to the rhythm of pumping pedals, sweat gleams on\
  \ heaving chests, it slicks hair to temples and necks.\nThe cyclists wear helmets,\
  \ because sorry but this is Canada and safety comes first you know, but little else.\
  \ The first cyclists pass me and crest the hill. Bums lift off narrow racer seats,\
  \ legs pumping, balls bouncing, to get every ounce of speed and strength for that\
  \ final push up the hill. My view of daffodil covered fields and the great ocean\
  \ blue is illuminated by full moons in broad daylight. \nI didn\u2019t know that\
  \ my visit to downtown Victoria would coincide with the annual Naked Bicycle Race,\
  \ nor do I see the cause of the collision. I hear it though.\nThe swearing comes\
  \ first. I turn my head in time to catch the moment when one naked body hangs in\
  \ the air. Inertia arrests the front tire while the bodies of rider and bicycle\
  \ flip over the handlebars and hit the ground. Two, three, four cyclists go down\
  \ in an orgy of tumbling, twisted metal and flesh. Bystanders groan and hiss in\
  \ sympathy as asphalt bites tender skin. \nOther riders stop to help and almost\
  \ everyone stands up, little the worse for some road-rash in unfortunate places.\
  \ They remount their bikes, but one woman wheels hers to the side of the road. The\
  \ front wheel turns with a wobble and a squeak and she limps alongside it. While\
  \ the bike could probably be fixed it\u2019s clear she won\u2019t be finishing this\
  \ race. \nA man taps her on the shoulder, a stranger by the way they shake hands.\
  \ He gestures to his bike, although I can\u2019t hear what\u2019s said, I see her\
  \ smile and nod, and I mentally congratulate him for his chivalry. \nHe lifts one\
  \ leg and straddles the seat, legs braced to hold the bike steady. The woman turns\
  \ to face the front, holding the handlebars in an awkward backward grip, legs spread\
  \ to straddle the front tire. Her breasts jiggle when she jumps, she grimaces and\
  \ wiggles when the front brake bites into her butt. He pushes off the pavement and\
  \ puts his feet on the pedals, I hold my breath when they wobble and almost fall,\
  \ unable to hold back a cheer when they steady and start down the road again. \n\
  A breeze picks up, cooling heated skin, caressing exposed nethers. As they wobble\
  \ past me I hear the man say, \u201Cnice day for it, eh?\u201D"
