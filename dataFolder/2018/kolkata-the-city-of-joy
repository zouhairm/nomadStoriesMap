Text: "There was dead silence in the river bank while I waited for my ferry to arrive\
  \ that I had never heard before, everyone there was just trying to absorb the feeling\
  \ of total relaxation, it was beyond any explanation how one of the noisiest city\
  \ can be so calm at the same time.\n\nToday was one of the most-satisfying adventures\
  \ of my life as I canoed through Kolkata city, in a quest to uncover the reason\
  \ behind its nickname \u201CCity of Joy.\u201D\n\nI was extremely looking forward\
  \ to seeing the river Hooghly from Howrah Bridge. I stepped in from the left sidewalk\
  \ and as I was finally there I took a minute to notice the surrounding. The last\
  \ thing that I thought would attract me got my attention, I was drawn to this alluring\
  \ melody coming from a flute.\n\n\u201CBabu, do you want to buy one of these?\u201D\
  \ he stopped playing the flute by sensing my presence.\n\n\u201CThis one costs 100\
  \ rupees.\u201D He asked, pointing at the topmost layer of the bamboo he was holding\
  \ the flutes with.\n\n\u201CSorry, I don\u2019t know how to play,\u201D I said.\n\
  \n\u201COh! But you could always learn,\u201D he said with adoration and resumes\
  \ playing the flute.\n\n\u201CDada, what is your name?\u201D I asked him out of\
  \ curiosity.\n\n\u201CAlok Roy,\u201D he answered.\n\n\u201CThis music of yours\
  \ is captive. How much do you earn in a day by selling these flutes?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \n\u201CNot much, but the appreciation that I receive by playing is worth more than\
  \ money.\u201D He resumed playing as I listened in silent amazement. I wanted to\
  \ interrupt him once more but vainly struggled for a voice.\n\nThe melody was still\
  \ reverberating in my head as I saw the ferry arrive.\n\nThe scenery of the sun\
  \ setting at the back of Vidyasagar Setu while crossing the river was spectacular,\
  \ and at that time I discovered something beautiful, I discovered that the most\
  \ exquisite kind of agony can easily be relinquished; by one\u2019s perception of\
  \ contouring a sunset. The feeling was too surreal to believe.\n\nOf all the places\
  \ I was today the only picture that was in my mind was that if twinkle in the eyes\
  \ of Alok explaining the joy of playing the flute despite being destitute.\n\nAnd\
  \ then there was this girl who was singing on the ferry for money. I closed my eyes\
  \ and took pleasure in her singing, I could clearly feel her wings of joy spreading\
  \ like a giant bird as she was drunk with the joy of singing, and it seems that\
  \ my heart would break with pride. Living for almost two decades in the city, I\
  \ experienced the tears of joy streaming down my face for the first time.\n\nBy\
  \ the time I was home the answer was loud and clear"
