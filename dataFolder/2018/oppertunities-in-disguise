Text: "If you\u2019d have told me twelve months ago that by 2018, I\u2019d have been\
  \ a volunteer in breath-taking Namibia, I would never have believed you! Last January,\
  \ I\u2019d been rejected for a yearlong placement abroad, had missed the deadline\
  \ to apply for Uni and was feeling pretty down. Four months later, I found a placement\
  \ that would change my mentality very quickly; A five-week project on a rural conservancy\
  \ in the heart of the Namibian desert. It was perfect, but the time between being\
  \ accepted and flying out was a very short two months. Cue the manic flight booking\
  \ and packing of bags!\nThe last thing I expected after my initial rejection was\
  \ to be stood in the back of a truck later that year with eleven other volunteers,\
  \ being driven down a rocky Namibian dirt track to our placement on Oana Conservency,\
  \ a bumpy two-hour drive south-east of Warmbad, three from Karasburg - our home\
  \ for the next five weeks. After the initial meeting, we soon became friends, helping\
  \ each other with any-and-everything. My tentmate helped me refine my photography\
  \ skills, showing me how to take night shots, and everyone always had some \u2018\
  interesting\u2019 ideas to add to the weekly blog I was writing!\nIt felt like a\
  \ dream, that I would wake up any minute back home. Instead I woke every morning\
  \ to the baboons calling, the geckos barking and the hot African sun warming my\
  \ skin. My excitement grew, and I threw myself into everything that came. We hiked\
  \ to and rafted down the Orange River, conducted ecological surveys of the water\
  \ quality, removed old fencing, built fences around vegetable gardens in Warmbad\
  \ school, tracked Kudu, Gemsbok and mountain Zebra up and down volcanic and quartz\
  \ mountains, set bait for leopards to be collared while trying to track them on\
  \ our drives, hunted for reptiles with a local expert, mountain biked, trekked a\
  \ dozen dried waterfalls and mountains, had sundowners on the rock faces around\
  \ camp and a few days at Fish River Canyon spa.\nIt\u2019s strange to think that\
  \ if I had been accepted for the yearlong volunteer project, I would not have visited\
  \ the deep south of Namibia, met any of the friends I now have and never would have\
  \ seen the incredible landscapes, been on any of the brilliantly exhausting hikes\
  \ or any of the wildlife that surrounded the camp. This lesson taught me never to\
  \ give up on finding alternative paths to where I want to go, even after failing!\
  \ Namibia was the best beginning for me and I\u2019m so glad I was rejected, which\
  \ is something I never expected!"
