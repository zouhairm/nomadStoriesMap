Text: "At approximately 4a.m. in the chill of an Australian winter (which is really\
  \ only a few degrees below comfortable for inhabitants of the more frostier climates),\
  \ a group consisting of myself and two friends, whom I\u2019ve known for over a\
  \ decade started up the base of Mount Warning \u2013 a just-under-an-hour\u2019\
  s drive from the city we\u2019ve grown up in. The idea beforehand had been simple\
  \ and idealistic: get up early, pack a picnic, and climb a mountain to watch the\
  \ sunrise. In winter, the summit is the first place the sun hits on the east coast.\
  \ A perfect view. We were sold.\nThe thing no one ever thinks about when committing\
  \ to these kinds of adventures is this \u2013 the beginning. Buffeted by great,\
  \ howling winds that hadn\u2019t forewarned us in our part of town when we\u2019\
  d driven off that morning, we started hiking up the path, nothing but the pinprick\
  \ lights of our headlamps and torches as guidance, completely surrounded by the\
  \ night. At the mercy of the elements, hundred-year-old trees creaking, twigs and\
  \ leaves crunching beneath our feet, and all manner of forest creatures stalking\
  \ about, we made jokes of slasher films and ghosts, paused to identify bush turkeys\
  \ that had startled us every ten minutes, and questioned our sanity only half-sarcastically.\n\
  The trek estimates a 2-3 hour hike, and about halfway in, the first light had started\
  \ to illuminate the darkness around us, our torches obsolete, our nerves less shot\
  \ with the possibility of supernatural creatures and murderers hunting us. However,\
  \ this oncoming light had everyone panicking for a new reason. We were struggling\
  \ to reach the top in time to see the birth of a new day.\nThe final climb to the\
  \ top involves a steep incline of rock, the only safety precaution being a few rusty\
  \ poles nailed into the ground at intervals all the way to the summit, linked by\
  \ an equally rusted chain to pull oneself along. Hands grip cold metal, our bodies\
  \ ache and burn despite the chill air. One friend slips, but rights herself sans\
  \ injury.\nAnd then we stumble out onto the man-made platform at the summit, providing\
  \ a 360-degree view of the volcanic basin below, entwined with rivers, bulging with\
  \ mountains, scattered with cities. The darkness makes everything softer, as if\
  \ we are intruding on a time of day we were never meant to be part of. We nestle\
  \ up together, exhausted, but entranced as we sip our hot tea and watch the salmon-pink\
  \ clouds turn into an epically mesmerising spectacle over the horizon."
