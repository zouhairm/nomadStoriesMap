Text: "A solo journey which pushed me from cliff, giving me wings to soar, keeping\
  \ my roots intact\u2026\n\nThe flight landed at Singapore. I stepped out of the\
  \ flight, intimidated by what to expect next. This has been the longest journey\
  \ of my life. \n        Born and brought up in a conservative Indian family, I was\
  \ aware of every little thing that could go wrong and was skeptical for things to\
  \ go right.\nI collected my cabin luggage with a fluttering heart and tried smiling\
  \ to put myself at ease.\n       The airport was buzzing with life and soon I found\
  \ myself amidst a sea of strangers from every possible country. People who travelled\
  \ for various reasons but had one common score. They were strangers under one sky,\
  \ keen to fly. \n     I clutched my backpack protectively to my chest and surveyed\
  \ around. Everyone had warned me not to go alone, but I was determined to prove\
  \ them wrong. Determined to expose myself to every possible danger, exploring my\
  \ potential, expanding my frontiers to the next level.\n  I nervously latched at\
  \ the straps of my bag as I moved towards the MRT station to board the MRT to the\
  \ hostel. The smell of coffee and laughter hung around. Airport is usually a happy\
  \ place, which lifts your spirits anyways. But unfortunately, not mine, this time.\n\
  \ Soon I found myself gaping at the metal box, which would transport me to my new\
  \ abode. Feigning calm, I tugged down the scarf and fumbled with the backpack again.\
  \ I wondered if I appeared messy, but I desperately wanted to fit in.\n        As\
  \ the train rolled over, I observed my surroundings and was overwhelmed by the versatility\
  \ of human race. A fellow passenger smiled at me and asked where I was from. Soon\
  \ we were more like a pair of friends meeting after a long time. My vulnerability\
  \ gave way to an unexpected ease, as I stared out through the big window at the\
  \ various landmarks she pointed at. My inhibitions started wearing off and I realized\
  \ that I could be anywhere in the world. We all are identical, sharing similar need\
  \ for love and acceptance. Latitudes are longitudes vary. But does that matter?\
  \ We all have the same wavelengths. And all of a sudden, I had a new perspective,\
  \ which made my fears vanish, replacing it with a newly found, childlike possessiveness\
  \ of my home, the world, wherein every country is just an abode, its existence insignificant,\
  \ yet significant. \nA new era opened for me and I could not wait to sprawl my wings\
  \ and take off!"
