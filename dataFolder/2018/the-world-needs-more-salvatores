Text: "I've spent one year in beautiful Bologna, and Italy now feels like a second\
  \ home to me. I had heard about the dichotomy between the North of Italy (home of\
  \ the polentoni) and the South (where the terroni live). 'But every country has\
  \ got its inner competition between regions and cities' I thought 'the South could\
  \ not be that different from the rest.'\nI started realising how wrong I was as\
  \ soon as in my taxi ride from the airport to the centre of Naples. The cab was\
  \ rushing down tiny winding steep streets while its driver was texting and/or negotiating\
  \ the price with the other passenger. A proper introduction to beautiful, exhuberant\
  \ Naples. Walking around it is like attending a 24/7 show. People yelling or gesticulating,\
  \ cars honking, scooters overtaking randomly, old ladies letting down buckets from\
  \ their balconies for their errand guy, shopkeepers rambling on about their products,\
  \ tourists gorging on outrageously delicious food and incredible Art. Only one thing\
  \ is sure there: there's always another surprise waiting for you just around the\
  \ corner.\nMine consisted in a coffee bar. As soon as I entered, I found myself\
  \ engaged in a conversation with the waiter, who kept asking me questions \u2013\
  \ where I was from, if I was traveling by myself \u2013 and complimenting me for\
  \ my good Italian. The thing is, I had just got lost and was still a bit shaken\
  \ up. I have a disastrous sense of direction and my map didn't take the relief into\
  \ account, thus at times not making sense at all. Napoli is scraping its way from\
  \ the port and historical centre to the top of the hills defiantly facing the Vesuvio,\
  \ offering beautiful views from countless uncertain stone stairs and hidden paths.\
  \ It's definitely part of the charm of the city, but following up routes that didn't\
  \ lead where I thought it would really freaked me out. But Salvatore's joyful chit-chat\
  \ made me forget all about my misadventure and eager to continue exploring. \nI\
  \ came back there everyday for my breakfast cornetto and cappuccino. He would always\
  \ enquire about my whereabouts of the day, giving me tips about the city or talking\
  \ about previous French tourists staying nearby. On my last day, he kissed me on\
  \ both cheeks. He'll never know how his natural self enabled me to upgrade from\
  \ a lost little girl to a proper member of the neapolitan community, who belonged;\
  \ just like that, by taking the time to chat with me over a small pizza margherita.\
  \ I hope Starbucks will never take root in Italy: the world needs Salvatores!"
