Text: "In 2011 I worked in Italy as a wine sales agent and one of my colleagues was\
  \ a smart guy that left that job just after some weeks.\nWe liked each other and\
  \ we kept in touch, although we were living in different regions.\nIn 2014 he proposed\
  \ me to try to begin a professional photographer for a digitalising project in the\
  \ archive of my city.\nThat was the beginning of a new step in my life: I opened\
  \ my VAT code and became a freelancer.\nThe work was hard but with interesting prospects,\
  \ even if it finished in few months.\nAfter that, I started to look for other jobs\
  \ but I was just finding bad employments and I was becoming really frustrated.\n\
  I couldn\u2019t understand why was so hard getting a good job for a 30 years old\
  \ guy, with 2 bachelors, one degree, one master and many professional courses, able\
  \ to speak in english and in spanish too...\nI really wanted to change my life.\n\
  I felt I needed to leave my country and try myself in a new challenge.\nAt the half\
  \ of July, my friend \u201Cappeared\u201D again telling me: \u201CI got a project\
  \ in Oslo, Norway. Do you want to go there?\u201D.\n2 weeks after I was there...\n\
  I remember the tears of my mother, the sad face of my girlfriend but I felt I had\
  \ to go.\nNo salary, just the opportunity the earn well if I worked well. Making\
  \ a good production in a big quantity and changing my life...\nSo I did it.\nI came\
  \ to a north country, with my simple english and just one only experience of living\
  \ abroad as erasmus student, years before, and I gave all the best of myself every\
  \ single day.\nI had to show to myself and to the others, Italy disappointed me\
  \ and didn\u2019t deserve my time, my energy, my brain, my hunger... my life!\n\
  Although I worked many hours alone every day, I built up great relationships with\
  \ local people and not only: I became a referral person of the community of the\
  \ italians living in Norway, attending to many events organised by the italian ambassador\
  \ Giorgio Novello and his wife.\nI was a white paper and I was writing a new story,\
  \ my story, since nothing.\nI stayed in Norway one year and half, even if at the\
  \ beginning I just thought to stay some months. I managed all the entire project,\
  \ taking almost 1.700.000 photos.\nAround the end of the project I had the opportunity\
  \ to remain in Norway, working as a bar manager in an italian wine bar, but I refused.\n\
  I felt my time in Norway was finished, even if I liked that country but I wanted\
  \ to back home. I was ready to back to Italy, proud and sure of myself.\nThat was\
  \ the beginning of my new life."
