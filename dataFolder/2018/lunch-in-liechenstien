Text: "After driving for hours through Germany we stop in the magical Principality\
  \ of Liechtenstein for lunch. The real-life fairy tale alpine nation. Two women\
  \ dressed in summer dresses pushing prams walk past. We stop to ask them what the\
  \ prevailing building on the hill was.\n \u2018The castle? Where the prince lives\u2019\
  . \n\nWithin an instant, we were in the middle ages, as if nothing had changed.\
  \ As if over the past centuries, not a thing had changed.  Ignorant to the messiness\
  \ of politics and the confusion of technology the city was quiet and felt like a\
  \ part of the world paused in time. \n\nThe women in summer dresses gave us directions\
  \ to reach the castle, and despite this we still got lost in the silent and serene\
  \ city. We lapped the city of Vaduz in 20 minutes by accident, eventually made it\
  \ to the castle at the top of the hill. The mountains and trees span for what looks\
  \ like forever and make it easy to shut out the rest of the world. You could see\
  \ the entirety of the city and probably the borders onto Switzerland as your reminded\
  \ that it\u2019s quite obviously one of the smallest country in the world. \n\n\
  Evidently the Austrian and German influences on the country come through in the\
  \ cafes and shops but the tourist office is determined to project its national identity,\
  \ selling distinctively local chocolates and passport stamps. \n\nLiechtensteiner\
  \ identity, however, is remarkably different to that of its surrounding European\
  \ countries. As if the people of Liechtenstein recognise the beauty of their land\
  \ and view it as valuable. In a way the natural environment creates an appreciation\
  \ for their nation rather than a constructed notion of national identity. Visiting\
  \ Liechtenstein, it becomes clear how influential geography can be on a country\u2019\
  s identity. \n\nAnd it\u2019s the women in the summer dresses that bring to life\
  \ the national identity, their respect for tradition and their surroundings that\
  \ makes Liechtenstein the faraway nation it is."
