Text: "My story begins in Marrakesh. My boyfriend and I were travelling to the Sahara\
  \ desert and had to spend a night there. Everything was ready, our Riad was waiting\
  \ for us with a taxi at the airport and we had rented a car from our hotel to start\
  \ right the next day our road trip. Everything started wrong: our flight was delayed\
  \ and we arrived in Morocco 2h later; it was 12pm and our taxi was not waiting for\
  \ us - there was no public transport at that time. We found the way to get to the\
  \ hotel and, once there, SURPRISE! It was closed!\nWe got in touch with the hotel\
  \ and called the manager as his phone number was in the booking page; we had no\
  \ answer. So there we were, two twenty- something Spanish guys with our backpacks,\
  \ all our desire to meet Morocco and without having any idea about where to spend\
  \ the night. We were near the Yamaa el Fna square so we decided to move around and\
  \ look for another hotel. We gave two steps and came across a really nice neighbor\
  \ who had seen our situation and decided to help: he offered us to stay at his place\
  \ for the night, offering some food and drink. Although at the beginning we did\
  \ not trust him, it was a strange situation and we were somewhat confused. Some\
  \ minutes later, and seeing that we were not really into it, he came out of his\
  \ house with a little girl and his wife. They invited us to go with them to a near\
  \ restaurant. That was the best decision we could have ever take: we got into a\
  \ small restaurant, just in the corner, and it was full of young and talkative natives.\
  \ We were there for a long time, had some dinner and danced with the people. That\
  \ was incredible, the smell of the place was genuine, and the taste of the meal\
  \ was delicious. We had the opportunity to get to know some people during our night.\
  \ I met a Moroccan girl; she was 21 and she was from Ouazzarzate, a place we were\
  \ visiting in the next few days. She gave me some recommendations, where to eat,\
  \ and where to stay. Never had we thought that our travel to Morocco would have\
  \ been so authentic. The next days went awesome! We followed my new friend\u2019\
  s advice and got around the cities as we have been there before, tried the best\
  \ restaurants and connect with the Moroccan\u2019s essence. At the beginning we\
  \ thought that lucky was not on our side but, after all has passed, this has been\
  \ one of the most authentic nights I have ever lived. As an advice, of course, it\
  \ is difficult to trust unknown people but, sometimes, and just sometimes, you just\
  \ have to let yourself go."
