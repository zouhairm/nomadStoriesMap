Text: "\u201CYou are drunk,\u201D said Shani, laughing.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m not!\u201D\
  \ I collapsed on the ground next to her. \u201CI\u2019m just happy.\u201D And it\
  \ was true: the metal thermos of Konyagi and orange juice that my host sister had\
  \ smuggled outside was still mostly full. The earth was fragrant and quiet, the\
  \ massive silhouette of Mount Meru like a starless bite taken out of the night sky.\
  \ We rolled onto our backs. \u201CI think that\u2019s Southern Cross,\u201D I said,\
  \ pointing, but every cluster of stars looked the same.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s strange,\
  \ isn\u2019t it?\u201D said Shani. \u201CWho you meet, and how, and when? We just\
  \ met but I feel like I\u2019ve known you forever. Do you feel that?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Yeah,\u201D I said, \u201Ctotally.\u201D I\u2019d arrived in Arusha alone and anxious,\
  \ but Shani\u2019s family had made me feel immediately welcome. Maybe it was the\
  \ pine-tree scent of Konyagi, faint on her breath, or the summer breeze sweeping\
  \ up from the Serengeti, but at that moment, I believed in fate and kismet and connections.\
  \ Maybe ten thousand years ago our souls were here, under slightly different constellations,\
  \ bound up in ibex or Mesolithic hunter-gatherers or intertwining cowpea plants\
  \ or the Hale-Bopp comet or the stars themselves. And we met there, at the end of\
  \ the last Ice Age, Shani and Kate, ibex and hunter, cowpea and comet, and now as\
  \ human beings we recognize something infinite and essential in one another.\n\n\
  Somewhere to my right, Shani burped.\n\n\u201CDid you hear that?\u201D she said.\n\
  \n\u201CYeah, maybe lay off the juice,\u201D I laughed.\n\n\u201CNo, I am serious,\
  \ someone is out there.\u201D\n\nThere was a moment of tensed muscles and total\
  \ silence.\n\n\u201CI don\u2019t hear anything,\u201D I said. But then we both heard\
  \ it: the unmistakable rustling sound of someone walking through the grass behind\
  \ us. I snapped on my headlamp, expecting to see one of Shani\u2019s younger brothers\
  \ swaying there in the breeze like pappus grass. Instead, a dark figure loomed in\
  \ the ghostly glow of the LED bulb.\n\nWe froze. He froze. His big, vacant eyes\
  \ seemed to suck up the light like black holes; his heavy horns curved like the\
  \ villain\u2019s mustache in a melodrama. It was a massive water buffalo. \u201C\
  Don\u2019t run,\u201D came a whisper from beside me. \u201CJust back up slowly.\u201D\
  \n\nWe backed up a few paces in careful unison. Then Shani broke. She turned and\
  \ ran, and then we were both running and laughing until our sides hurt so badly\
  \ that we couldn\u2019t take any more of either. In the morning, there were only\
  \ piles of half-dried water buffalo dung and the impressions of two bodies in the\
  \ grass\u2014and the kind of friendship you carry with you into the next life."
