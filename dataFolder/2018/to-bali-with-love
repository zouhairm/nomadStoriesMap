Text: "It was soon after my daughter turned one we planned a trip to Bali, Indonesia.\
  \ The trip was necessary because we felt overworked and tired and we knew a trip\
  \ like this will revive us. We planned the itinerary and were ready to say hello\
  \ to the magnificent land!                  \nWe finally arrived at the Island of\
  \ Gods! Our hotel was in Kuta and it took some time to reach there from the airport.\
  \ It was easy to communicate with people because most of them understood English.\
  \ Our hotel was comfortable and we just wanted to get some good sleep. The next\
  \ day we went to see the places close by. Kuta beach was intense with its frothy\
  \ pounding surfing waves and bustling markets on the shore.  It is the best place\
  \ to surf, party and forget rest of the world. Seminyak on the other hand was quite\
  \ sophisticated and calm. We lazed around the Seminyak's Petitenget beach and had\
  \ delicious sea food there. The next day we hired car service from Putu Arnawa.\
  \ He deserves a mention for the amazing service he provided us. His cars were so\
  \ comfortable with amazing drivers who suggested best of the places to visit and\
  \ all the local delectable Indonesian cuisines to try. Our driver suggested some\
  \ of the best local eateries, also called 'warungs' here. We went for a day trip\
  \ to Ubud and were mesmerized by the Balinese artwork, astounding array of temples,\
  \ its stunning and so diverse topography. While eating local food at warung, we\
  \ befriended some locals and they were so lovely. The Balinese people are amazing\
  \ with children; they offer delicious food, have kid friendly places and plenty\
  \ of engagements for your little one! \nThe next two days we explored the Kopi Luwak\
  \ coffee plantation, Kintamani volcanoes and the Balinese dance - Kecak and Barong.\
  \ We went for a day trip to Bali safari and marine park, which my daughter loved!\
  \ \nEvery place we went to we were always greeted with warm, welcoming smile. The\
  \ enchanting volcanic peaks at Kintamani, emerald green terraced rice fields of\
  \ Jatiluwih, natural trails at Ubud, and the Indonesian islands. It is true that\
  \ love emanates from every corner of Bali and you can find your spiritual awakening\
  \ here. I particularly loved spending time at Tanah Lot, which is home to the ancient\
  \ Hindu pilgrimage temple Pura Tanah Lot. It is a rock formation off the island.\
  \ There is something about the sunset backdrop and the way waves come crashing constantly.\
  \ It is \nBali reminds you that you need to stop, stare and admire the beautiful\
  \ thing called life!"
