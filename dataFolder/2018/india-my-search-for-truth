Text: "At 50, I let go of the life I knew and opened my heart to something I never\
  \ dreamed possible, traveling to India. I knew the perfect place to practice surrendering,\
  \ it was the motherland India.\n\nA friend recommended Kunal, my local guide, and\
  \ nothing could have prepared me for the Old New Delhi Market. The narrow backstreets\
  \ were utter chaos; overflowing with cows, goats, rickshaws, tuk-tuks, and people\
  \ amongst colorful shops.\_\n\nAs our overnight train departed, the sun set and\
  \ the sumptuous dinner was served. As we drank the deep dark wine, we shared stories\
  \ of love and loss and laughed all night as we sat in our modest bunks.\_It was\_\
  midnight\_when we were awakened by the attendant warning us the train was leaving\
  \ the station.\_Kunal jumped off as it started to move, still half asleep I stepped\
  \ into my flip flops, threw on my 15lb backpack, and as Kunal reached for my hand,\
  \ he caught me as I jumped!\_\n\nThe adventure had just begun; every-time I got\
  \ into a car I was prepared to die as we weaved in and out of none existent lanes.\
  \ It took all day to get to our destination; arriving at our Hotel I exited the\
  \ car frazzled and depleted. A welcoming plate of shrimp and vegetables was placed\
  \ in front of me, as I sat overlooking the busy street on the hotel terrace.\_As\
  \ Led Zeppelin ironically played in the background I yearned for my bed, comforts,\
  \ simplicity. I was physically miserable but emotionally satisfied in a way I had\
  \ never felt before. At that moment I understood how attachment creates unnecessary\
  \ suffering.\_\n\nSeeking the truth in all matters and learning to accept the present\
  \ situation, life became amazingly peaceful. Feeling refreshed, we visited the local\
  \ village, Baba, Kunal\u2019s Guru, prepared a magnificent traditional duck feast,\
  \ with my blessing he skillfully slaughtered it using a simple kitchen knife. Dinner\
  \ was prepared on an outdoor stove and we indulged in the natural alcoholic palm\
  \ tree juice. We ate on the floor using our hands as I enjoyed the most relaxing\
  \ buzz; suddenly I realized I was alone in the middle of nowhere with men I barely\
  \ knew.\_\n\nIn one moment all of my confusion became clear. Everyone suffers, it\
  \ was not exclusive just to my life. To truly experience joy, we all get to experience\
  \ pain. I looked into the wise eyes of Kunal my Guru and instantly compassion replaced\
  \ my anger, love my disappointment, forgiveness my fear. \_I would return with a\
  \ rewarding yet conflicting relationship with India, and my life would never be\
  \ the same."
