Text: "The dream of a lifetime\n\nWe are a couple of Quebeckers aged 53 and 61 years\
  \ old. We made the decision to sell everything and resign from our insurance business\
  \ to live the dream of our lives. Go around the world in a backpack for a period\
  \ of 2 years. Many of our friends and relatives thought we were crazy about going\
  \ on an adventure and leaving everything behind, but we received a lot of congratulations\
  \ and encouragement to live this dream and achieve our goal. My wife Brigitte saw\
  \ everything we needed to do to be safe (health and finances) all over the world.\
  \ After 18 months of preparations for the country we would like to visit, the impact\
  \ on travel insurance and the preservation of our rights.\n\nFollowing the goodbye\
  \ and beaks to our loved ones, we took off in July 2016 in Iceland with a single\
  \ trip to our first destination.\n\nIceland, an unexpected discovery by the beauty\
  \ of landscapes, volcanoes, galleons and green mountains. The roads along the fjords\
  \ and mountains plunging into the cold waters of the Atlantic Ocean make it a detour\
  \ a must. Iceland remains for us a favorite country.\nScotland and the medieval\
  \ castles are followed. The beautiful city of Edinburgh is a return to the history\
  \ of kings and queens with its cobblestone streets and castle on a promontory overlooking\
  \ the city and region of Edinburgh.\n\n\_The goal of improving our level of English\
  \ was present during this trip. To meet this challenge, we opted for professional\
  \ exchanges for accommodation and food. Our first experience is produced in Iceland\
  \ with a super hot family in a Edeir carnarde farm for harvesting. This experience\
  \ was really interesting and motivating. Our tastes, our desire to discover the\
  \ wonderful country and the improvement of our English took us to South London in\
  \ England for two weeks. After 2 months of cold and rainy weather, given our tastes\
  \ for climbs, seas and lakes, Crete has been our country of origin to recharge our\
  \ energy and gain strength.\nIn March 2018 after more or less 20 months of travel\
  \ we return to Canada. This wonderful trip made us discover countries of Europe,\
  \ Asia, Oceania and South America. Our memories contain fabulous memories and incredible\
  \ encounters with locals and travelers of all ages.\nChile was our last destination.\
  \ This country very diversified by its Patagonia, its glaciers, its cultural cities\
  \ and the wonderful area of \u200B\u200BSan Pedro de Atacama make it a great success\
  \ for the realization of this objective of life, to realize a world tour."
