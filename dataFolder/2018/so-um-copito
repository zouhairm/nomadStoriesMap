Text: "My last night in Porto surprised me more than what I could ever expect. Neglecting\
  \ the suggestions of a foodie friend, I went to another typical place, Casa Guedes.\
  \ I waited my turn more or less 10 minutes, slightly annoyed by an Italian family\
  \ who didn't respect the queue; when my turn arrived, after paying, I decided to\
  \ sit inside at the counter, next to a man, 70-75 aged, a portuguese version of\
  \ Ernest Hemingway, in his colorful hawaian shirt and his white beard. After a fast\
  \ chat with a french couple, about how yummy was my s\xE1ndwich de pernil, he winked\
  \ at me and then he offered me some of his wine, just one cup -s\xF2 um copito-,\
  \ because wine it's a pure liquid and, within 3 glasses, it is better than any medicine.\
  \ Me and Nunes, that was his name, started talking, first in French, because he\
  \ thought I was so, then in Spanish and at the end in a mix of Portuguese, Italian,\
  \ Spanish and French. He told me that he loved that place and that it was our home,\
  \ because without any of us, it was nothing. Then we discussed about the similarities\
  \ between Italy and Portugal, he really disliked Lisbon because people from there\
  \ just care to appearances. We agreed on how people nowadays have no more time and\
  \ trust for the others, so concerned in appearing instead of being. Then we shifted\
  \ the conversation on our lives: -I speak with you, not about you was his premise-\
  \ he was quite surprised by my plans, and my travelling alone, that in a quick analysis,\
  \ in his opinion I'm crazier than him. For his experience, he suggested me to not\
  \ trust women, especially the ones whose name is Amalia, and to read people's intentions\
  \ in the eyes, it's easier than how it seems. Then he let me try Bolinhos de Bacalhau\
  \ and, quite surprised about my strong will of doing the Camino de Santiago, he\
  \ asked me why. I replied that it's because of the people, their eyes, because I\
  \ trust humanity. I disappointed him, probably because I'd even trust Amalia, but\
  \ then he told me that if it wasn't for his age, he would have come with me, just\
  \ for verifying if a girl probably 50 years younger than him was right. Then he\
  \ poured me some other wine and asked to a very patient waiter, his favourite dessert:\
  \ bread with fresh goat cheese and apricot jam. Now, I don't eat cheese but I bended\
  \ the rules for Nunes. I promised him that we'll meet again before next year (he's\
  \ not sure to live more), so he'll wait me every Saturday from 7 to 8 pm at the\
  \ same place because he can't wait to hear my stories."
