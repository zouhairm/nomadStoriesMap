Text: "It was a boring Friday as Fridays are mostly boring. I was sitting in the office\
  \ and one collegue told that her friends organized a trip to Paris the next weekend.\
  \ I could accompany and didn't hesitate although I had no time to prepare or read\
  \ any travel book.\nWe arrived in Paris and I started my own adventure.\nI was standing\
  \ somewhere and I had no idea where I could find a metro station. I watched movies\
  \ about Paris and thought that I know this city. Paris's been my dream city. I assumed\
  \ that I can see the Eiffel Tower from every street of Paris. My plan was following\
  \ the direction of Eiffel Tower and walking there. This Tower is so high and highlighted\
  \ in every picture, I thought that it will be easy to spot it. Guess what? No, it\
  \ was a false presumption. I found a nice square without any view to the Tower.\n\
  \nI got a map but didn't know where I was because there was no signspot. While I\
  \ was desperately looking at my map, a boy asked whether he could help. He spoke\
  \ French. I can order coffee and buy delicious 'pain au chocolat' in French. We\
  \ agreed to use English as a common language.\nI told him my problem, he laughed\
  \ at me and offered his help. He told me that he has some official task to do but\
  \ it took only a few minutes and then he had a free afternoon. I accepted this plan.\n\
  We went to a vocational center where he did some kind of administration. I stood\
  \ on the corridor with a lot of French people, they were talking and I experienced\
  \ something from the everyday life of Paris. It was not like in the movies. The\
  \ corridor was tight and dark as you imagine an administration office.\nWhen he\
  \ finished his task, he showed me the Tower Eiffel. He knew where to stand to take\
  \ the perfect tourist photo with the Tower in the background. Did you know that\
  \ there's a small park next to it and that it flashes for minutes before they turn\
  \ off its lights?\nWhen I had enough of the Old Lady, we had lunch at a restaurant\
  \ which was located in a beautiful small street. Later we visited the Champs-Elys\xE9\
  es. He taught me how to pronunce Champs-Elys\xE9es and explained me how it looks\
  \ like at Christmas. He was an interesting person and it was an amazing day.\nThat\
  \ Saturday \xCD had my own travel guide. We agreed to meet Sunday, but he couldn't\
  \ make it.\n\nThis adventure happened 10 years ago but I still tell this story to\
  \ my friends. He showed me the face of Paris that I would never find if we didn't\
  \ meet that afternoon. And I am still grateful because he offered me his help and\
  \ time."
