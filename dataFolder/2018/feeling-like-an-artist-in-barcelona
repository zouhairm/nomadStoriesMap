Text: "Barcelona is quite honestly the most beautiful city I have ever laid eyes on.\
  \ \n\nAfter traveling to Paris for a few days, we were relieved to finally be at\
  \ the Barcelona leg of our journey. Don't get me wrong, the city of Paris is a beautiful\
  \ treasure, but our experiences there were less than ideal. I thought of it as the\
  \ most romantic city in the world, until a few days later, when we took a quick\
  \ flight to Barcelona. \n\nVery few cities I have visited, have what I call \"the\
  \ home factor\" where you could actually picture yourself living and existing there.\
  \ The city was fresh and alive, and it's people seemed vibrant and bright as we\
  \ pulled up to our hostel.  I have always had my nose in fantasy books about far\
  \ away lands, and I didn't realize it until just that moment, but this scene is\
  \ exactly what I was picturing in my head when I was reading about all those adventures.\n\
  \nWhen we went out to dinner, and found ourselves in a breezy causeway filled with\
  \ outdoor tables and bistro lights for dining. We sat down to a smorgasbord of delectable\
  \ food, and when the waiter poured us a luscious glass of red sangria, I realized\
  \ that I had been drinking piss all my life. \n\nJust as I thought it couldn't get\
  \ much better than this, a guitarist came up and started picking a beautiful melody.\
  \ It was at that moment, the combination of all of these things, it made me realize\
  \ that this was far more romantic than Paris, and it may have even been one of the\
  \ most savored moments of my life. \n\nFrom there, our experience was only enhanced\
  \ by the euphoric days exploring the city of Barcelona. Seeing the nearly 4,000-year-old\
  \ ruins made me realize that this city is an entirely other world. We were told\
  \ that the people of Barcelona are fighting constantly to free themselves from Spain,\
  \ and they take every opportunity to spit on the traditions of Spain. The Gemini\
  \ in me does love a good group of rebels.\n\nBut I think the quality that made the\
  \ city most special to me, was the artwork. I am no artist by any means, although\
  \ I have always admired from afar. I have always been quite jealous of what artists\
  \ can do with their talents and you can find it at every corner you turn. But it's\
  \ more than just the fact that art is everywhere you look in the city, it's that\
  \ Barcelona itself, is made of art."
