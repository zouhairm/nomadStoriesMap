Text: "Munnar is one of the most beautiful hill stations in South India. Last summer\
  \ we planned to spend a long weekend in Munnar. Since it was going to be a a fairly\
  \ long ride we started off from Bangalore on a Thursday evening after office. Friday\
  \ was a holiday because of Good Friday.and\nEnter Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary\nThere\
  \ is an entry check point at Chinnar Wildlife Sanctuary. Someone was collecting\
  \ Rs 20 from all drivers and without understanding why we also paid up and then\
  \ realized later it was not a regular ticket, just a tip or you can guess what.\
  \ There was really no need for that. The first thing that we noticed on entering\
  \ Chinnar was the big tamarind trees with ripe tamarinds. After resisting the temptation\
  \ to grap a bunch my friends finally decided to move on. I am not very fond of raw\
  \ tamarind so I was not that interested. \nChinnar Wildlife sanctuary is barren\
  \ and arid with thorny bushes and very little green vegetation. One can easily make\
  \ out that this is the rain shadow part of the ghat section. Although there is a\
  \ beauty of the vast expanse , it is really not a place to visit during summer for\
  \ normal tourists."
