Text: "I did not expect, one day in May odorous and serene, to walk the streets of\
  \ Hiroshima for about 7 km, along with Matsumoto.\n\u2026I still have a few minutes\
  \ to observe my Bom Dome, then I approach Matsumoto, which shows a face not very\
  \ convinced, I try to express a sense of satisfaction for what I saw, and always\
  \ communicating through our language, by now, Bungled, I ask him, kindly, if he\
  \ can accompany me to the Museum of Peace.\nWe resume the journey, I think between\
  \ myself-the visit to the museum will be different, and here I'll find what I'm\
  \ looking for-while these thoughts float in my head, suddenly I'm in the middle\
  \ of a park, it's a special park. \nIn front of me I have a monument, of which I\
  \ can\u2019t understand well the shape of the lower part, the top seems to look\
  \ like a missile, I raise my eyes and on the tip of this strange sculpture stands\
  \ a sculpture that portrays a little girl with arms open in flight of prayer . Something,\
  \ during my studies, has certainly escaped me, I have never seen on the books nor\
  \ heard of this sculpture.\n I have to deepen, perhaps the ignorant are just me,\
  \ I approach the monument, but suddenly I see no longer around me Matsumoto, has\
  \ disappeared \u2013 my God, left me alone in the park!-I couldn't say hello and\
  \ thank him\nArrived at the foot of the monument, magically close the eyes, I do\
  \ not know how, prominent a long flight, like a bird, to the top of the heavens,\
  \ where there are hundreds of children in front of me, perhaps thousands, however\
  \ many, of all ages, mixed between males and Females, they kidnap me, they take\
  \ my hand, I hear their breaths on their necks, their voices, their tales are overlap:\
  \ they talk to me about their classmates, the masters, the subjects they studied\
  \ at school, the games or favorite animals, the places where they grew up, of the\
  \ brothers, sisters, of their parents, grandparents, of their desires, of what they\
  \ would have wanted to become great, but above all they speak to me of a bad illness...\n\
  They tell me what the war was, not the one described in the history books, but of\
  \ another, ask me to tell my students the truth, what I saw today, ask me to spread\
  \ a message of peace, so that the horrors that have occurred do not longer repet.\n\
  Tacitly listen to their lesson in history, store everything in my head, then, among\
  \ the large group of children, here I see you advancing towards me, beautiful, smiling,\
  \ proud and pride in wearing your favorite kimono, stretch your hand towards me,\
  \ the Open: give me a crane"
