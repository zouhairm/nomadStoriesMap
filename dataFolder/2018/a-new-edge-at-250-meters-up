Text: "\"... things happen when you take risks.\"\n-Roadsworth-\nThe edge is one of\
  \ few places where you can find out who you are trully. It is when faced with hardship\
  \ and challenges that you discover the depths of your constitution and I believe\
  \ that if proper travelling does anything, it's challenge you. Often times though,\
  \ it is not enough to simply react to challenges. I believe that, often, one should\
  \ seek them out.\n\nOne night,  wandering in the streets of Hong-Kong,  I came across\
  \ a towering skyscraper being built on the shores of Victoria Harbour. I've had\
  \ a few experiences with urban exploration, but never in a foreign country let alone\
  \ this monumental and in such a crowded area. For long,  I sat in the shadow of\
  \ this colossus debating if I should try to conquer it. Eventually, I reckoned that\
  \ I did not leave the safety of home just to seek it here. I began scouting.  It\
  \ seemed to be properly blocked off from every side, with tall sheet metal walls\
  \ topped with barbed wire and bustling Hong-Kong provided an abundance of potentially\
  \ prying eyes, but after an hour I found a public bathroom that could possibly give\
  \ me access to the site if I managed to scale it. After 45 minutes of waiting for\
  \ a window of opportunity, I happily scaled the bathroom and started climbing down\
  \ the back in a hidden gap adjacent to the construction site,  when the shadow of\
  \ a man turned the corner, looked up at me and spoke to me in Cantonese, which I\
  \ do not speak; 2 minutes of victory. Resigned to this failure I came down to meet\
  \ with him, but as my eyes adjusted to the dark, it seemed to me that this young\
  \ man was dressed in a way that was peculiar but familiar to me. He donned a dark\
  \ hoodie, a small bagpack, cargo pants and fingerless gloves; clearly not a security\
  \ guard. He spoke English and asked me what I was doing here. I answered simply\
  \ ''I was going to try to climb this building''. He smiled and said ''me too''.\
  \ It turns out that he had gone to the top twice before already and knew the way.\
  \ After passing over the fence,between the barbed wire, behind night crews and walking\
  \ up 70 stories (\u2248250m) , we sat on the edge of the highest rooftop I have\
  \ ever been on, our feet dangling over the void, and looked out on one of the most\
  \ beautiful city view I have ever seen.\n\nWe travel to discover; about the world\
  \ and ourselves. But I believe that sometimes it's not enough to prod carefully\
  \ into those, sometimes we need to actively seek out the edge, and consequently,\
  \  push it further."
