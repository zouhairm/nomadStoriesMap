Text: "Salt exhaust in the air, sand sticking to my legs, the sweet taste of absinthe\
  \ going down my throat and the feeling of freedom still stuck in my chest trying\
  \ to find a way to get out. We were laughing under the shiny moonlight, talking\
  \ about the trips we would like to do when we had time, ignoring the fact that we\
  \ never would find such a perfect moment to travel as now. It was our moment. \n\
  \nBarefoot, kinda tipsy and with the silly smile you have when you are excited,\
  \ I walked to the hostel at 5 in the morning from the Black Sea shore, in Varna.\
  \ I borrowed my roommate\u2019s backpack and I heard their disbelieving laughs over\
  \ and over in my head while I was packing in the shadow my travel diary, a pen,\
  \ my passport, \u201CThe Dharma Bums\u201D and some clothes. I put my flip flops\
  \ on and I headed to the train station; the sun was going up and I was confident\
  \ that this crazy decision would change my life...and indeed it did. \n\nThe meandering\
  \ railway drove us through the Balkan mountains upon the rivers and villages. The\
  \ rattling of the carriage, my own compartment, the breeze caressing my face through\
  \ the window...I felt like I was going back in time, especially when we arrived\
  \ to Sirkeci Station at 6 in the morning: old men fishing across the Galata Bridge,\
  \ women covered with colored veils and the sound of the boats arriving to the port\
  \ from the Asian side of Istanbul, the city of the thousand minarets.\n\nI stayed\
  \ at Melik\u2019s flat, in Bah\xE7elievler\u2019s neighbourhood. I didn\u2019t even\
  \ knew where it was or what should I expect from my host, I\u2019d met him through\
  \ Couchsurfing an hour ago. I wanted to be totally immersed in the locale, dive\
  \ into the culture I\u2019d heard my parents talk about in my childhood, guided\
  \ by Turks of my age. I ended up drinking beer with 15 Turks, all speaking English.\
  \ His friends also cooked the tastiest lamb I've tried and other traditional dishes,\
  \ a homemade gastronomical tour.\n\nThe scent of the hot apple tea mixed with the\
  \ saltpetre and unknown spices exploded in my nose. All my senses were awake and\
  \ I perceived every stimulus impacting on me stronger than ever before. We chatted\
  \ about everything while on the way to his favourite places, some empty spots from\
  \ which we could glimpse the chaos they call home.\n\nCompletely wet, slipping on\
  \ the marble floor at night, wearing a black medical gown, lost and little bit scared\
  \ after the dolmu\u015F trip, I realized how far I was. I found myself as a traveler,\
  \ a young adventurer journalist with a whole world to write about\u2026"
