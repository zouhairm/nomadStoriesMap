Text: "I hadn\u2019t anticipated a reeking sheep as a fellow passenger, firmly held\
  \ on the lap of a large sweating man, in a stifling, overcrowded taxi, racing its\
  \ way to Essaouria. It bleated at companions, variously strapped to roofs, carried\
  \ by crazed riders on whiny mopeds, as reluctant passengers on rusty buses, slumped\
  \ across the shoulders of scrawny men, and carried in baskets of emaciated donkeys.\n\
  \        \u201CWhat are all the sheep for?\u201D I asked.\n        \u201CAlhamdulillah,\u201D\
  \ replied the man, shrugging his shoulders, clearly unable to speak English.\n \
  \       The following morning, as the rising sun flashed through a gash in the sky,\
  \ soaking the city in crimson, an abrupt wail emanated from the mosque, followed\
  \ by a blaring siren. Instantly, smiles of sharpened steel slashed the throats of\
  \ Morocco\u2019s four million innocent. I watched with fascination and revulsion\
  \ from the roof of the riad, as blood spilt in pools, livers and hearts dangled\
  \ on hooks, women washed intestines in buckets, and boys and men hacked knowingly,\
  \ laughing as they skinned carcasses - hanging from beams, on searing roof terraces,\
  \ by their hooves. Unremitting plaintive bleats had ceased. Drains flowed with the\
  \ satisfaction of hot blood. Screeching gulls filled the sky. Morocco, like Ibrahim,\
  \ had made its sacrifice. \n        Later that morning, I walked through narrow\
  \ streets, nauseating smoke filling my lungs. \u201CWe cut head in half. Good in\
  \ tagine with tomato sauce,\u201D cried one of the frenzied young men attending\
  \ a crackling fire. With glaring eyes and sooty face, he kissed a handful of brain.\
  \ In baskets beside him, were numerous severed heads. \u201CIs delicious. Try!\u201D\
  \n        \u201CA photo?\u201D \n        The man\u2019s eyes bulged with rage. \u201C\
  No pictures!\u201D he screamed, the knife used for plucking out brain, held firmly\
  \ in his palm.\nThe last thing I expected, as I reached the high wall of Essaouira\u2019\
  s medina, was to also arrive at the borders of my cultural comfort zone. Why had\
  \ Allah pressed Ibrahim to sacrifice his son Ishmael, or, as in the Christian Old\
  \ Testament, Abraham his son Isaac? What sort of dispassionate God demanded such\
  \ slavish obedience? \n        \u201CRonaldo!\u201D screamed a child, kicking a\
  \ sheep\u2019s head down the street.\n         Eid al-Ada seemed far removed from\
  \ Easter, with its wrapped leg of lamb, complete with cooking instructions. But,\
  \ it was essentially the same. Would I now retreat into a walled medina of cultural\
  \ certainty, create dialogue at my borders, or open myself to an ever wider vista\
  \ of reality?"
