Text: "The cabbie pulls up at a series of tarpaulins connected between red brick buildings.\n\
  \u201CFish market here.\u201D\n\u201CCheers mate.\u201D\nI hop out, fold the map\
  \ of Southeast Asia into my pocket and walk through to the Malacca fish markets.\
  \ Peddlers scan me without suspicion. CNN headlines haven\u2019t reached this place.\
  \ Yet. Stingrays hang from crucifixes, plastic sheets are covered with squids and\
  \ sardines, old ladies in worn aprons and kitchen gloves shout sales pitches. Blokes\
  \ sit at the back of the stalls, playing checkers, laughing like schoolgirls.\n\
  I approach a fishmonger lady. She gives me a toothless smile. Her leather skin belongs\
  \ in a Marlboro commercial. \n\u201CDi mana kapten ikan?\u201D (Where is the fishing\
  \ captain?)\nPterygiums fill her colourless eyes. She yells to the old men gambling\
  \ out back. A rake of a man stumbles forwards, cigarette to his lips, smoke wafting\
  \ up through his thinning hair, oversized sandals on his muscular feet, a torn black\
  \ shirt drenched in sweat and fish guts hanging over his wiry frame, glued to his\
  \ sinew shoulders.\n\u201CMembawa saya ke bandar Dumai?\u201D\nI\u2019ve asked if\
  \ he can take me to Dumai City. It\u2019s the nearest port in Sumatra; a hop, skip\
  \ and jump across the Malacca Strait away and my only hope of escaping the Singapore\
  \ police and a Changi execution. Right here, right now, this man is God. \nHe takes\
  \ a break from puffing his cigarette to look me in the eye and laugh louder than\
  \ anyone I've ever heard. I'm broken but this is it, this is everything, my life\
  \ or death is in the hands of this fishing captain I've just met.\n\u201CMembawa\
  \ saya ke bandar Dumai?\u201D\nHe continues laughing. Louder than before. Fuck.\
  \ I lean in close to his aged face, \u201Csatu ribu dolar. Membawa saya ke bandar\
  \ Dumai?\u201D I hold his eye with the deathly serious stare I will hold now until\
  \ the day I die. Can't be far off. I\u2019ve told him I have $1,000 for him if he\
  \ can take me to Dumai.\nHe doesn\u2019t answer. I'm dead. I place the money in\
  \ my pocket, turn to walk away. I take three steps, pray he speaks. \n\u201CSir,\
  \ yes, I take you. Dumai. No problem.\u201D\nGod, thank you! I turn back, hand over\
  \ the money and hug him close. I\u2019ll be broke soon, but I'll still be free.\n\
  \u201CWe leave two in morning, boss.\u201D\nHe points to a group of tiny boats bobbing\
  \ up and down in the harbour, looking unfit to cross an Olympic pool, let alone\
  \ the busiest shipping route on the planet.\n\u201COK, see you at two.\u201D\n\u201C\
  You crazy man, boss.\u201D\nI smile, wave him goodbye. No turning back now. In twelve\
  \ hours God and I are crossing the Malacca Straits."
