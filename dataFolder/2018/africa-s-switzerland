Text: "Driving through downtown Maseru in Lesotho (a mountain kingdom and the only\
  \ African nation that is completely landlocked by one other), is akin to driving\
  \ through the Centreville of most small capital cities in the third world. You have\
  \ \u201Ctall\u201D buildings on one side, a main mall on the other and cab drivers\
  \ pulling the most creative feats in rush hour traffic. Before long, we reach the\
  \ residential areas subtly yet also clearly divided by class. Once the last zinc\
  \ house is in the rear view, a long stretch of paved road nestled between two modest\
  \ hills welcomes us. One that only four years ago did not exist. \u201CAh, progress,\u201D\
  \ I think of my beloved country.\n\nAs the rain falls, the aroma of the red earth\
  \ is discernible through the closed windows of the hospital\u2019s Land Cruiser.\
  \ By the time we reach the base of the mountain, the rain has stopped, but the fog\
  \ looms heavily. The driver, Ntate Lesole (or Solankis as he is affectionately known)\
  \ stops the car, turns to look at us and in a cool, collected voice says: \u201C\
  We\u2019ll be driving through fog.\u201D\n\n\u201CAll the way?\u201D I think, and\
  \ as if hearing my thoughts, he says: \u201CAll the way.\u201D \nA two-hour trek\
  \ up the mountain will now last four or five.\n\nMy mother, who has been sitting\
  \ silently in the front seat (to allow us to acclimatize?), encourages us to snuggle\
  \ into the seanamarenas- the traditional blankets that have been made popular by\
  \ the \u201CBlack Panther\u201D movie. It\u2019s going to be a long drive.\n\nSolankis\
  \ puts the car back in gear and up we go.  \n\nThe fog, denser than cotton candy,\
  \ engulfs our surroundings as we trudge up, inch-by-inch, bend-after-bend through\
  \ nothing but whiteness. Blind. The road is narrow with only one lane per direction\
  \ and every bump silently rocks us out of our rudimentary naps. I take solace in\
  \ that not many people drive up the mountain unnecessarily. \n\nRising bright and\
  \ early the following morning at the summit of Thaba Tseka and walking through the\
  \ grounds of the modest hospital my mother effectively runs we greet nurse nuns,\
  \ groundskeepers and patients- the stench of hospital disinfectant masked well by\
  \ their hopeful smiles. \n\nFinally we reach the other side. A side not frequented.\
  \ A side so clear now that the fog has lifted- giving way to the gliding valleys\
  \ and scattered mud houses. A view that stretches far and wide and green; well beyond\
  \ the many summits in sight. I now realize that we didn\u2019t miss anything on\
  \ our way up- the fog was simply protecting all of this. \n\nIt was the last thing\
  \ I expected. It was beauty."
