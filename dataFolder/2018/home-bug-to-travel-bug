Text: "The last thing I expected was falling in love with traveling. For 18 years\
  \ of my life I have favoured my home. I could go days, maybe weeks in the comfort\
  \ of my bed. A bed is heaven. Now all I use the bed for is sleeping. \n\nI recently\
  \ came back from a 2 and a half weeks vacation in Australia and before that I spent\
  \ 3 months in a New York summer camp. This story isn\u2019t about my camp experience\
  \ so I won\u2019t go into too much detail. But what I can say, living in the US\
  \ made me cherish traveling.\n\nA few months after camp I went to Australia in their\
  \ summer time which is my winter time. I\u2019m British so it was upsetting when\
  \ I heard stories about Australian Santa Claus who apparently wears Hawaiian shirts.\n\
  \nMy adventure started in New South Wales where I was staying with a friend. We\
  \ went up to Sydney. It was the typical tourist stuff; bondi beach, opera house\
  \ and the harbour bridge. \n\nThe vacation wasn\u2019t just about exploring but\
  \ the people I met along the way, which brings me to my first road trip. A few days\
  \ into my stay I was persuaded into going to the Gold Coast in Queensland. Instead\
  \ of taking an hour flight, we decided to drive for over 8 hours. There was six\
  \ of us, two boys and four girls including myself.\n\nOn our way to the Gold Coast\
  \ we stopped off at the Big Banana cafe which sales different banana food items.\
  \ The list is almost endless. Unfortunately I don\u2019t really like bananas, thus\
  \ I took pictures against the giant banana that stood in front of the cafe as if\
  \ I did eat in there. \n\nThe next day we went to see sunflowers. Reader, are you\
  \ jealous? Now, this isn\u2019t the time to be jealous because after a 2 hours drive\
  \ we got to the sunflower field and the sunflowers weren\u2019t there. So instead\
  \ we ended up finding a field beside train tracks where we settled for an hour.\
  \ I don\u2019t know if running on train tracks is illegal but it was refreshing.\n\
  \nOur journey back was the most stressful, hilarious and outlandish experience.\
  \ We were an hour drive away when the battery in the car died but at the time we\
  \ didn\u2019t know it was the battery. We managed to pull over to a bike lane before\
  \ the complete destruction of the battery.\n\nWe all panicked, a few were on their\
  \ phones ringing for help and were told help wouldn\u2019t come until past 11 that\
  \ evening. A 3 hours wait. We had each other, hence we did what friends do best,\
  \ entertaining one another. Think about two drunk friends trying to get home. We\
  \ wasn\u2019t drunk but we were delirious by how tired we were, although we managed."
