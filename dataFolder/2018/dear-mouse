Text: "\u201CRemember, though \u2013 always hit them on the back of the legs. Never\
  \ hit them over the head, because you might kill them.\u201D\nThese are the last\
  \ things I ever would have expected to hear coming out of someone\u2019s mouth and\
  \ being spoken directly to me, let alone that person be a work colleague holding\
  \ a piece of lead piping which was normally stashed under the desk for \u201Cemergencies\u201D\
  .\nHowever, apparently this advice was strictly necessary at my new place of employment:\
  \ a hostel situated on a street which was home to a lot of unsavoury characters,\
  \ in the centre of Barcelona \u2013 a city which, so far, I had found to be both\
  \ occasionally frightening and consistently beautiful. \nI suppose my colleague\
  \ took one look at me - an awkward, dorky and incredibly na\xEFve young girl fresh\
  \ over from a sheltered life in England, land of tea breaks and apologising for\
  \ everything \u2013 and took pity on me.\nUpon hearing his advice, I wasn\u2019\
  t sure whether laugh or cry. So I did both. I laughed uncontrollably for the entire\
  \ sweaty metro ride home at the end of my shift, in sheer disbelief. Then, when\
  \ I made it home to my shared flat in the charming district of Gracia, I shut myself\
  \ away in my room to have a little cry. What am I doing here? Why am I so scared\
  \ and lonely all the time? Does everyone living in a city feel like this?\nThe last\
  \ thing I ever expected, however, was not actually the prospect of committing acts\
  \ of violence at work on a regular basis. In fact, it was a discovery that lead\
  \ to one of the most unlikely and unconventional cures for loneliness: a discovery\
  \ that somewhere, buried deep inside the hostel reception desk which I worked behind,\
  \ there lived a mouse. \nThough I never formally met this mouse I would often hear\
  \ it scuttling and burying somewhere beneath me, and in a weird way, that was enough.\
  \ I suddenly didn\u2019t feel so alone on the solo night shifts. I found myself\
  \ turning to that invisible creature for comfort when a drunk guest came and shouted\
  \ abuse at me, or when all the power shut off on the second floor. Together, dear\
  \ Mouse and I made it through that strange and wonderful period of my life. I checked\
  \ in hundreds, maybe thousands of people. People from Mexico, Indonesia, France,\
  \ Japan\u2026 Big groups, solo travellers, and everything in between. I often made\
  \ friends or contacts in them, and my confidence grew from strength to strength.\
  \ And I like to think that it was the luck of having dear Mouse on board with us,\
  \ but I never had to use that lead piping once."
