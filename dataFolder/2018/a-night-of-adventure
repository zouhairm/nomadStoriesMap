Text: It was the summer of 2015 when my best friends and I went on a trip to the Nilgiri
  mountains, the trip was a sudden move to tackle the heat and end the boredom, a
  small fun frolic trip on our rusty motorbikes was our idea but it turned out to
  be an absolute adventure.It took us 8 hours to reach our destination the most beautiful
  thing I like about Nilgiris is the aroma of the eucalyptus it refreshes your mind
  with an amazing spirit and because of that we still felt we could go on after all
  that day's ride,  soon it was midnight but for us the night was still young ,we
  decided to make a campfire and have fun in the cold wild forest, as we grouped around
  to collect the firewood we started to look for our flashlights but since the whole
  trip was a sudden move we forgot to bring them and then it was just headlights of
  our motorbike to help us .Things started getting creepier as the night unfolded
  due to some unknown reason the headlight of our bikes stopped working, we were deep
  in the forest and only had our cellphones, therefore we decided to use them only
  when there was a turn so we cautiously started walking by retracing our path towards
  the highway,somehow we missed a turn and to our surprise we started hearing water
  gushing, moving forward we saw that it was a small rivulet  with an embankment to
  check its excess flow during the monsoon ,we decided to sleep near the embankment
  but  were awakened by a sound and saw a herd of elephants , just opposite to the
  embankment. We kept quiet and slowly climbed the embankment reaching the top of
  it and as we moving away I accidentally slipped into a hole that was an opening
  to a cave, we explored the cave with our mobile lights to see if it was safe! to
  our amusement we saw painting carved on the walls with different animals and scenes
  of hunting but soon the mobiles were out of battery and suddenly we started getting
  a rotting smell inside the cave to our surprise there was a lot of blood and we
  ran like hell.With moonlight guiding our way we somehow reached the highway, the
  next day morning we found our bikes  with the help of rangers, they told us it was
  very risky what we did and not to repeat it, but what boggled our  mind was that
  cave which was nowhere to be found, soon it was turned as a hoax by the people,
  we always talk about it and wonder about the blood in the cave.It was a night shrouded
  in mystery where seeing the herd and exploring a prehistoric cave was the last thing
  we expected.
