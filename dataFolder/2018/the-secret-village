Text: "As a little girl, I dreamed of becoming an explorer and discovering the world\
  \ to find unknown peoples at secret places and study their culture. A part of me\
  \ was highly disappointed, when my parents told me, that there were no unknown peoples\
  \ anymore, but another part didn\xB4t believe them and I decided to prove them wrong.\
  \ Years later, I found what I had been looking for. In the Sierra Nevada of Santa\
  \ Marta, Colombia, I got to visit an indigenous village the Kogi live in.\n\nWhen\
  \ a local friend asked me to join him on his trip, I knew how lucky I was, as not\
  \ many tourists get this opportunity. After a four-hour scooter ride from the city,\
  \ on bumpy and dusty paths through the Sierra Nevada, the world\xB4s highest coastal\
  \ mountain range, we finally arrived at our destination. I was immediately fascinated\
  \ by the village, a formation of round, wooden huts, standing in the middle of a\
  \ tropical paradise, hours away from what we call civilization.\n\nThe inhabitants\
  \ were sitting together and looking at me, shyly and expectantly, but not in a defensive\
  \ way. I built a paper kite to break the ice between the children and me and it\
  \ worked: they looked at me curiously and then took my hands to show me their world.\n\
  \nThe Kogi wear white clothes, women have colorful jewelry and nobody wears shoes,\
  \ as they believe that walking barefoot connects them to mother earth. A child invited\
  \ me to its family\xB4s hut and I was surprised to see that they don\xB4t sleep\
  \ in beds but in hammocks. In the middle of the village, there is a hut, the temple,\
  \ where the Mamas, the wise men, get together every night to talk about recent happenings.\
  \ I learned that the Kogi\xB4s tradition is dominated by spiritual and cosmological\
  \ rituals, such as ceremonies and dances. All children attend school, which is why\
  \ younger people, unlike the elders, speak some Spanish. A challenging future is\
  \ waiting for the young generation, as the tribe often gets involved in conflicts\
  \ with the government, and it will be their duty to protect the Kogi\xB4s traditions.\n\
  \nAround 400 years ago, when the Spanish were about to conquer the American continent,\
  \ the tribe fled into the Sierra Nevada and has lived there ever since, leading\
  \ the same way of life it had back then. Only for about the past 40 years, they\
  \ have been in touch with civilization.\n\nMysterious peoples still do exist, and\
  \ I was lucky enough to get the opportunity to make a connection to one of the last\
  \ that have been able to maintain their precious way of life for over 400 years."
