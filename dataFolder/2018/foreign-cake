Text: "It was November 18th, almost midnight, and after three hours I was still at\
  \ the airport, waiting for the host who was supposed to pick me after my arrival.\
  \ Her delay was due to the weather, that decided to pour rain down on the day before\
  \ my birthday. Yes, I was about to turn 25 in like... almost 25 minutes, in a whole\
  \ different country, without any of my friends or family, completely alone. Now\
  \ you must be asking yourself: \"Ok, that's the last thing she expected her birthday\
  \ was meant to be.\". Although, dear reader, that was not my biggest surprise in\
  \ that night, because I was about to have a major one.\nI was sitting at one of\
  \ those relatively comfy sits of the Auckland Airport, in New Zealand, with my foot\
  \ over my charming rose gold suitcase, shaking my allstar on the sound of Kings\
  \ of Leon, when she appeared. Now you wonder: \"Who? A famous person?\" Sorry to\
  \ disappoint you, but no. Who suddenly showed up at the airport, with a little bit\
  \ of a wet hair, was my best friend! She has been living in New Zealand for quite\
  \ a long time now. I still remember the day we said our good-byes three years ago\
  \ when we finished college and she moved there. Then suddenly she is right in front\
  \ of me, with a piece of cake inside a bowl and a smile on her face. That was the\
  \ most perfect present I could receive - not the cake, but my friend's presence.\
  \ Ok, a little bit of both. \nOf course I was hoping to see her in NZ. After all,\
  \ I was traveling to the city where she was living. Although, what I would never\
  \ have thought is that a few minutes before my birthday, when everything looked\
  \ like lost, was when I was going to see her again. So we used the time to catch\
  \ up until the arrival of my host, that sent me a text a few minutes before that,\
  \ saying she was almost there, just parking the car.  \nOn the next day, me and\
  \ Isabella - my friend - went out to know the city. She took a day off from her\
  \ job to show me everything that she loved about Auckland, and it was the best tour\
  \ I could have. The city is pretty much small and with a lot of buildings, but we\
  \ can feel a different energy on the streets. People seemed happy to live there,\
  \ and it was not for less because I was already happy myself for being there too.\
  \ That made me realize that a trip is always a journey that leads you to a whole\
  \ new world of discovery and it is awesome to live this adventure, but it is also\
  \ very nice when we have a familiar face to enjoy all of that by our side."
