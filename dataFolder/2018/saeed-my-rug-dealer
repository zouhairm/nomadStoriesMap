Text: "Amidst the chaos of wild motor scooters, undefined alleyways, and captivating\
  \ sights and smells, we made our way through the mysterious souks of Marrakech under\
  \ intense sun and sweltering heat.\nAn elderly gentleman smiled, inviting us into\
  \ his corner rug shop. He offered me a cigarette and poured a fresh pot of mint\
  \ tea. Inside, carpets of vibrant colors and intricate designs were stacked from\
  \ floor to ceiling.  With a warm \u201CSalaam\u201D, Saeed began explaining his\
  \ treasured rugs: the type of materials used, knotting techniques, and each tribes'\
  \ unique style.\nOur brief encounter was enjoyable, as was the mint tea, and we\
  \ purchased a few small rugs.  He offered to hold onto them for us, providing we\
  \ joined him for lunch the next day.\nDespite the casual nature of our meeting,\
  \ Saeed's lunch offer was indeed sincere.  Upon arrival, we enjoyed a delicious\
  \ lamb tagine, with fresh khobz from a neighboring bakery.  We were also cordially\
  \ invited for dinner later that evening.\nWhile gorging on fried chickens over mounds\
  \ of couscous, Saeed asked about our plans during our stay in Morocco. Caroline,\
  \ Meg, and I were close friends, spontaneously travelling around Morocco with no\
  \ set plans.\n\"Are you all married?\"  \n\"No.\"\n\"Why not?\"\n\"Its hard to explain\
  \ Saeed, we're just friends.\"  \n\"Do you all live together?\"\n\"No.\"\n\"Why\
  \ not?  Do you always travel together?\"\n\"No, not necessarily.\"\nWe wanted to\
  \ go to the Atlantic coast.  As we said goodnight, he offered to drive us to the\
  \ bus station the following morning.\nSaeed cheerfully arrived at 7:30 in his Honda\
  \ outside our riad, with bus tickets to Essaouira in hand.  He sent us on our way\
  \ with prayers, blessings, and a sense of confidence.\nUpon our return to Marrakech,\
  \ we thanked Saeed and finalized our shipment of rugs back to Denver.  He had them\
  \ neatly stacked, each addressed individually to our respective addresses, our marital\
  \ status still confusing him.\nTo this day, when asked about Moroccans, I describe\
  \ a humble, friendly, helpful man.  My genuine rug dealer, Saeed, who still calls\
  \ me each New Year.\n\u201CHello Wilbert, this is Saeed from Marrakech, how are\
  \ you? How is your family?\u201D \nVery matter of fact, as if I wouldn\u2019t recognize\
  \ his voice, his distinct accent, or his strange international Skype phone number.\n\
  \u201CWilbert, can I speak with Meg, or Caroline?\u201D\n\u201CNo Saeed, they are\
  \ not here right now.\u201D\n\u201CWhere is Caroline?  How is Meg?  When are you\
  \ coming to visit us again?\u201D\nI\u2019m fairly sure he still thinks we are all\
  \ married."
