Text: "Over the last years, the popularity of South Africa as a holiday destination\
  \ has increasingly grown and whenever I hear people talking about South Africa,\
  \ they say that is one of the most beautiful countries in the world. South Africa\
  \ has always been on my bucket-list and there is no doubt that it is a beautiful\
  \ country but that was not the only reason that attracted me to go there. \n\nWhen\
  \ I went to South Africa, I was a student and had to save money for quite some time\
  \ before I could finally go and do the one thing I was always dreamt about doing\
  \ when going to South Africa: a safari. I mean who does not dream of seeing these\
  \ mighty and beautiful animals in their natural habitat? The morning of the safari\
  \ me and my friend were extremely nervous, not because we were terrified, but because\
  \ we were very excited to finally go on safari and have this experience. As soon\
  \ as we climbed into the SUV, the journey for us and 4 other passengers commenced.\
  \ Driving through the reserve and being away from all the noise was such a calming\
  \ experience. Just listening to the sound of the air and enjoying nature was delightful.\
  \ Seeing the animals in their natural habitat, grazing and living their lives without\
  \ any bars was so nice and also liberating to see. For most of the time, the animals\
  \ kept their distance and I feel like they were afraid of the vans, although we\
  \ were driving very slowly. There was however one exception, well actually there\
  \ were two! At one point, there were two lions standing in front of the SUV. The\
  \ ranger stopped the van. And there we were in the middle of one of the biggest\
  \ game reserves in Africa standing in front of two lions. All of us were staring\
  \ at the lions and the funny thing is they were staring right back at us and you\
  \ could see the wonderment in their eyes. This moment was so intense that it felt\
  \ like we were staring at them for 10 minutes although it probably was not that\
  \ long.\nI have never felt this terrified and lucky at the same time. Terrified\
  \ because these lions were majestic. I mean you see lions at the zoo but seeing\
  \ them in the wild, they are even more impressive. And lucky because ever since\
  \ I was a child, lions have been my favourite animals. I always hoped that we would\
  \ see lions but I never would have guessed that we would see them from so close,\
  \ especially since all the other animals kept their distance. Because of that I\
  \ felt even more blessed to have experienced something this magnificent. It truly\
  \ was a dream come true."
