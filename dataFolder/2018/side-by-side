Text: "The temple was beautiful, not that the monkeys cared. In the late afternoon\
  \ sun, its golden walls glowed, the monkeys lounging carelessly from the statues\
  \ within.\n\nAfter a weekend in Kirirom National Park, our host, Rick, had decided\
  \ to end our time in Kampong Speu, a district in the South West of Cambodia, with\
  \ a walk to the nearby temple. Outside,  people lingered. An elderly woman busied\
  \ herself with cutting a large Jackfruit, one of the country\u2019s most distinctive\
  \ (and smelly) fruits. Inside, families sat in silence while monks blessed them\
  \ with good fortune.\n\nWith the smell of incense burning around me, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but feel blessed with my own good fortune. This was one of the most serene\
  \ and beautiful places I had ever been.\n\nIn 10 steps, my discernments were shattered.\n\
  \nHe had approached Rick, flip flops slapping against the dusty ground and beckoned\
  \ us towards a red figure through the trees. A stupa, a Bhuddist Shrine, its glass\
  \ panes catching the light and hiding the dark shapes inside.  The local man slid\
  \ the glass panel open.\n\nThe skulls were stacked up and up, all sizes, from the\
  \ bottom to the top of each layer of the stupa. Bands of black and white, the colours\
  \ tarnished only by the faded cloths that lay amongst them.\n\n\u2018He has known\
  \ people who have killed and those who have been killed\u2019 Rick translated the\
  \ local man's words. \u2018There was often no choice\u2019.\n\nHe explained that\
  \ 40 years ago, a regime of \u2018madness\u2019 had conquered the country. Overnight,\
  \ cities were abandoned and people forcibly brought to the countryside to work in\
  \ the fields, or to be killed.  Starvation was for the \u2018peasants\u2019. The\
  \ religious, the educated, the foreigners; they faced much worse. \n\n\u2018Mass\
  \ pits\u2026 200,000 Killing Fields in Cambodia\u2026 One fourth of the population\
  \ murdered\u2026\u2019. I stood, listening to a history that felt just as foreign\
  \ as I was.\n\n\u2018\u2026And here.\u2019 The local man had gestured around him.\
  \ \u2018One of the Killing Fields\u2019. \n\n Side by side, the horrors of the country\u2019\
  s past had been intertwined with the present. Monks continued their daily duties\
  \ just paces away from their persecuted brothers. Families returned, hoping for\
  \ good fortune, to a place where misfortune was now marked with a tall, red stupa.\
  \ I looked around the silenced glade. The monks, in their flaming orange robes,\
  \ strolled by in the distance. Rick, our undeniably educated host, appeared lost\
  \ for words. \n\nIn the silence that followed, it became clear; we would have had\
  \ no place in this world 40 years ago."
