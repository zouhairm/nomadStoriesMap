  s my cow, bull actually. We will pick it up on our way back.\u201D\nWe were stuffed\
  \ inside Nikolai\u2019s 40 year old Lada as we hurled ourselves down the mountain\
  \ road.The shocks were shot.We bounced around like popcorn in an air popper.I was\
  \ halfway through Kom-Emine, a 400-mile backpacking route across the Bulgarian mountains\
  \ from Serbia to the sea.I ran out of money, stupidly thinking I could use my credit\
  \ card.Rookie mistake.There wasn\u2019t an ATM for 20 miles.  \nLuckily, Nikolai\
  \ gave me a ride.Dear god, what was that smell?I looked around and saw only Nikolai.A\
  \ very distinctive flavor of BO permeated the car, it was as if garlic was oozing\
  \ out of his pores.Not surprising given the raw garlic Bulgarians often eat.Many\
  \ a vampire must have met his fate in this Lada.Nikolai was chattering but with\
  \ his accent nothing was registering with me.Does this window work?Nope.Nikolai\
  \ laughed, \u201CBulgarska rabota\u201D(a common phrase, literally meaning Bulgarian\
  \ work but more like c\u2019est la vie in meaning).I chuckled.\nI hit the ATM and\
  \ then the market.I ran out of food 10 miles back so my stomach was growling like\
  \ a tiger on the prowl.I found a Svoge and pounced.Svoge is the best chocolate bar\
  \ in Eastern Europe, somewhere between a Hershey\u2019s and Milka.I snarfed it down\
  \ like the transient I was and gobbled up a croissant to boot.Resupplied we headed\
  \ back. \nHalfway up we spotted the bull. \u201CWe need to drive him back or the\
  \ bandits will take him.\u201D I thought he was putting me on but he was serious.\
  \    \n\u201COne of us should drive the car and the other the bull.\u201D  I hadn\u2019\
  t done a lot of driving since I moved to NYC so I took the bull.  I was from Idaho\
  \ after all. \n\u201CI will get him going and then you keep him going.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Ok.\u201D\n\u201CUp the mountain you stupid idiot! You want the bandits to get you?\u201D\
  Directed at the bull not me, I hoped.\u201CYour turn.\u201D\n\u201CMove.You big\
  \ dummy.\u201DI grabbed a stick and banged it on the road as I walked.\u201CDon\u2019\
  t make me use this.\u201DApparently, the bull took my threat seriously as it headed\
  \ uphill lickity-split.\n\u201CThat\u2019s enough.He will make it the rest of the\
  \ way.Good work.\u201DI jumped in the passenger seat and we headed back up. \nSure\
  \ enough the bull made it.Back at the hut we talked into the night over a bottle\
  \ a rakia.I told him of the summer on the farm tossing hay bails.He told me about\
  \ the stray dogs he had adopted (15 in all).The next day I was back on the trail\
  \ with a newfound confidence in my bull herding skills and a new friend."
