Text: "Here, watching the snow flakes flying out of the window of the shopping mall\
  \ and the cold wind of November blowing against the tall buildings. I'm in a book\
  \ shop, drinking my Caff\xE8 Latte and thinking about my last Canadian days. I can't\
  \ believe it. I'm really here, in Toronto, in a real metropolis beyond the Atlantic.\
  \ A city in which numerous features are getting along.\nThe rhythm of the city differs\
  \ a lot from my Alpine village. People from everywhere, with different nationalities\
  \ and different cultures, living together in a kind of uniqueness that creates the\
  \ spirit of the city itself. This has fascinated me since the first day, since I\
  \ was welcomed by my homestay family. They have suddenly made me feel at home, as\
  \ part of their Canadian-Filipino family. Even if I was abroad, even if I didn't\
  \ know them before. And I had the same feeling yesterday, when I was in a Turkish\
  \ caf\xE9 spending an afternoon together with some friends - a Japanese, a Korean,\
  \ a Canadian. This image represents in some way one of the features of Toronto.\
  \ A characteristic that can be recognized just visiting some of its areas.\nPassing\
  \ after the Art Gallery of Ontario and walking along Dundas St W, looking around,\
  \ you have the feeling to find yourself somewhere else \u2013 shop signs written\
  \ in Chinese, restaurants of any kind selling you the best of Chinese food. \nOther\
  \ side of the city, in the area of Gerrard St E, you can be delighted by the wonderful\
  \ view of Indian shops displaying an incredible variety of Indian fabrics with fabulous\
  \ colors and decorations.\nOther location, in the downtown area, you can enjoy the\
  \ evening and have some fun dancing at the rhythm of Latin music with friends and\
  \ lots of people coming from Latin America.\nThe last thing I expected in fact was\
  \ to find all these different cultures blending together to create the spirit, the\
  \ essence of the city. It's true I've recognized a lot of Canadian traits in Toronto\
  \ \u2013 the weather, the presence of nature as the Ontario lake, the squirrels\
  \ near the streets, the trees and the green areas perfectly recognizable just looking\
  \ out of a skyscraper. But also the importance of hockey, a national sport, evident\
  \ for example in the Air Canada Centre area where people is always ready to attend\
  \ the next hockey game. However, I would have never imagined to perceive the Real\
  \ Toronto in the fusion of cultures I've met living the city. \nI'm still there\
  \ looking at the people outside, walking on the sidewalk, thinking that what I feel\
  \ it is true."
