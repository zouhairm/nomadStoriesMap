Text: "I was taken aback as my slightly expensive phone (and I )\nwere proving to\
  \ take not only it's time but everyone else's as well. The shop keep and travel\
  \ guide seemed frustrated, so I decided on using some inventive signs. With this\
  \ I am able to connect and communicate with vigorous enthusiasm and fun I hadn't\
  \ expected.  Walking fingers turn to fingers dancing, turning in to fingers dancing\
  \ instruction. \"mama belle\" a local, uses this form of instruction from across\
  \ the room to help me in the dance of the tango. (A dance not easily attempted let\
  \ alone mastered. ) \nWith my two left feet the people laugh in delight, clapping\
  \ as I continue to thrive though my follies. \nSitting at a candle lit table in\
  \ the street off to the side, I have a traditional dinner served to me .  A table\
  \ for one please! Enjoying the dance and food and music. The guitars thump and strummed\
  \ as the dancers seem to have the uncanny ability to make it all fit together just\
  \ so. My means of communicating were not only to meet my basic needs, but also find\
  \ some of the most intriguing & interesting historical features and local activities.\
  \ That is my goal. To tell of being involved and included with the music, dancing,\
  \ culture& food. \n   The hiking & exploring had been thought to be left for last\
  \ rises swiftly this day to be number one on my  list. \nIt had not been high on\
  \ my list although I looked forward to it. \nPartially expecting to be tired from\
  \ extended hiking and walking , I actually found  this made me only more energetic.\
  \ Seeing  such ranches and the presidential palace,  I knew then the sipping of\
  \ the vast red wines had made the ways of the communication connection a bond. The\
  \ translate app seems to take away slightly the more human primal communication\
  \ and understanding between those with a language barrier. Frustrating and taking\
  \ far too long still the translation app proves golden yet still frustrating as\
  \ it has a mind of its own. With this it's highly recommended to make local connections\
  \ and other ways.\nSome of the people may be slight to those wasting their time\
  \ but   overall patience begets patience. Again I was never good at charades,but\
  \ I'm getting better every day. \nNonetheless I find myself at the mercy of the\
  \ local shop keeps and they seem to have quote signed up for this.  So here I go\
  \ & there I went.  Everywhere I am with my enthusiasm and inquisitiveness hand in\
  \ hand.\n       The beauty of this land shines out form inside each individual no\
  \ matter the language barrier."
