Text: "My eyes were drawn to the distant snow-capped mountains. Closer hills danced\
  \ as the bus propelled me towards the city of San Sebasti\xE0n. My excitement could\
  \ not dampen the severe sleep deprivation that plagued me! After arriving, I climb\
  \ the stairs from the bus station and immediately notice my first breathtaking view.\
  \ Wide eyed and open mouthed, I stare intensely at the massive structure. Tourist\
  \ mode fully on, I grab my camera and start taking pictures. I break my concentration\
  \ and commence a safety glance. There were a dozen eyes focused directly on ME.\
  \ In an instant I became the sculpture.\n      Naturally, when eyes gaze in my direction\
  \ longer than a few seconds it triggers slight confusion and anger. Now paired with\
  \ the extreme lack of rest, it transformed into shuddering anxiety and panic. Is\
  \ this how monuments feel? I think to myself. I start walking briskly through the\
  \ small crowd accepting the fact that I may just need to recuperate.\n    Tranquility\
  \ washes over me as I observe more stunning scenery. The large, ancient buildings\
  \ halt, and I arrive at a beach with a 180\xB0 spectacle. The florescent mountains\
  \ sweep across the atmosphere and naturally contrast with the orange sand: a magnet\
  \ for the humming turquoise sea. I was in a dream. The vision doesn\u2019t last\
  \ long because as I passed people on the walkway more staring happens. It\u2019\
  s as if it never even stopped! I feel the totality of the volcano of emotions rise\
  \ to the surface: panic, sadness, embarrassment, anger, confusion, guilt, & pain.\
  \ I start to question myself as I gaze into the eyes of the strangers who find me\
  \ so interesting. \nWhy do I feel so uncomfortable when people stare? \n       Almost\
  \ like a flash of lightening to my soul, a memory surfaces\u2026 I am in a store\
  \ at about 4 years old. I did not listen, and I get punished with a violent smack.\
  \ I am loudly reprimanded while being taken out of the store. Everyone in the area\
  \ looks at me intently during this incident. Mirroring emotions surface from this\
  \ echo creating an epiphany and immediate transcendence.\nThe terror of that recollection\
  \ softens. I halt, turn to the sea and feel the waves enter my soul through the\
  \ open windows of my eyes dragging away every trace of negativity and self doubt\
  \ that had been attached to that memory. A missing fragment returned to my shattered\
  \ soul. My heart opened a little more and I notice my once tinted windows getting\
  \ lighter and lighter. Love, forgiveness, and hope are the only emotions that remained."
