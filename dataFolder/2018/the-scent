Text: "I couldn\u2019t sleep in that city. In the day, I was tired. I wouldn't recognize\
  \ the place with the lights on. I wasn't the only one. The city livened at night.\
  \ Tiles were stuck to the walls, reflecting a thousand moons. \nI'm not sure if\
  \ I dreamed it. It was something of the night. It slunk down the paths. Lagos is\
  \ a city of misdirection. Every night it took a different way, and lost me in the\
  \ labyrinth.\nI'll mention now, my weakness for pastries. I've been lured here and\
  \ there, by the crusts of the world\u2014but this scent rapped my deeper being.\
  \ It wove around the cityscape\u2014up and down terraces. It took me to the coast\u2014\
  then dissipated. The sea breeze interfered, and led me back to the walls. It was\
  \ a simple scent\u2014even, but rich. It could've been a tart or a cake. The smell\
  \ promised something new.\nI looked during the day. I sniffed the street stalls.\
  \ I must've tried ten pastries. It wasn't there. With the sun, the scent retreated.\n\
  I had other places to see. Each day, I came close to convincing myself that the\
  \ scent was a hallucination. Maybe it was fatigue fiddling with my sensors.\nWhen\
  \ the night rolled out, something sluiced through my window. I thought it would\
  \ waft away if I focused elsewhere. I tried to think about the sea, rocking and\
  \ swirling. The scent took over.\n\"One final look.\" I said. I went down- passed\
  \ an accordion player. \n\"Ol\xE1.\" He sung.\nI let the scent pull me\u2014past\
  \ a mangy dog; a dismantled bike; and two drunk women. It took me to the edge of\
  \ old town and clung to the wall. \nI was drawn to the quay, where the smell was\
  \ strongest. It was lifeless aside from a bobbing boat. A  man with a fish gut stained\
  \ cap looked at me.\nI tried to explain the scent, using the Portuguese I could.\
  \ The man raised his shoulders to every word, until I mentioned the night.\n\"Yes.\"\
  \ He said. \"I cook in the night.\" He lured me onto his boat. \"I do fishing tours,\
  \ in the day.\" He coughed something dark into his palm and shook it overboard.\
  \ \"Open a hand.\"\nThere was a pie on the table. He scooped a portion and I had\
  \ to open my hand, so that it didn't splatter on the floor. \n\"Fish pie.\"\nThe\
  \ smell burned my nostrils, as if something in the dish was fermented. \"Eat,\"\
  \ He said. \"I cook here. There is an oven.\"\nI saw the state of his oven, a small\
  \ prism in the cabin. It was swiped with rot and blood. The scent was too much.\n\
  \"My lunch.\"\nI tasted a piece of crust. The rot was there.\n\"This is it.\"\n\
  I washed my sticky fingers in a fountain on the way home. I was sick for three days."
