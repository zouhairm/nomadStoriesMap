Text: "As a kayak guide I always use my best judgement and caution is key. But when\
  \ I'm getting out there for myself it can be the most freeing, exhilarating and\
  \ exhausting experience. The west coast of Canada can offer wilderness at its most\
  \ raw and untamed. \nThis trip was sorely needed, I was in the early stages of chemotherapy\
  \ and was still able to regain some energy between treatments at this point. I wanted\
  \ to be out on the water despite the physical risk. I needed to be surrounded by\
  \ air and space and mountains. My friend Rachel and I packed up the essentials for\
  \ a trip out to the BC coast. We paddled out to an island in Indian Arm just as\
  \ the sun was starting to set. As the clouds rolled in, so did the darkness. \n\
  Here\u2019s where my inner 5 year old self comes out! The bioluminescence in the\
  \ ocean is the most intense that I\u2019ve seen in years! I strip down and jump\
  \ into the black water. My body is instantly illuminated in a pulsing blue glow.\
  \ Rachel follows suit. I sweep my arms through the water, disturbing the living\
  \ plankton, and ensconcing us in primordial light. \nThe chill of the water is becoming\
  \ apparent\_but the night is still young! We get the kayaks back on the water and\
  \ head out into the fjord. I can see the paddle of my fellow kayaker hitting the\
  \ water which is otherwise indistinguishable from the mountains, each stroke producing\
  \ an ephemeral whirlpool of light. The barnacles are feasting on the plankton, scooping\
  \ them up with long feathery arms and creating a sparkling disco ball effect along\
  \ the length of the shoreline. Then the wind picks up. It\_throws\_waves up that\_\
  break over our bows and rolls in warm gusts across our salt crusted faces. I\u2019\
  m feeling my body weakening as we tuck in between the next island and the mainland,\
  \ the water turns to\_black glass, it\u2019s 3am, the air here is still. The bioluminescence\
  \ is concentrated in the channel and\_all the more entrancing in the silence of\
  \ the witching hour. The water is shallow and each stroke ignites a burst of sea\
  \ life that scatter, illuminated bodies leaving dust trails of light. I\u2019m starting\
  \ to feel giddy with fatigue, pushing myself as we cruise at what can only be described\
  \ as a leisurely pace back towards the cove.\nAt 4 am we hit the beach. Daylight\
  \ is creeping in. It is always with regret that I get out of my kayak after an adventure\
  \ like that. My sea legs reject the solidity of land and I stumble about like a\
  \ baby deer. I\u2019m sure I will spend the next three days sleeping. But it was\
  \ worth it."
