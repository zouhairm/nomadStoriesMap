Text: "It was February 2013, after months doing my intership and saving all the money\
  \ I was getting from, I decide it was time to visit my good friend who lived in\
  \ Helsinki, Finland.\nThe big day arrived, time to go to Finland! I got on a flight\
  \ from Porto Alegre to S\xE3o Paulo, then from there to Munich, and finally to Helsinki\
  \ - Finland.\nMy friend was Finish, we met in University August, 2011. She was an\
  \ exchange student in a Brazilian University and she was taking a Portuguese class,\
  \ that I was also taking, I was the only person besides the teacher that spoke English,\
  \ so we became really good friends and we use to hang out a lot.\nWell, back to\
  \ the story, when I got to the airport I was looking for my luggage. The airline\
  \ kept saying something in Finish I couldn't understand and I was not paying much\
  \ attention as well, after an hour waiting for my luggage I went to the airline's\
  \ counter and they told me (in English) that they have been trying to tell me that\
  \ my luggage didn't come to Helsinki, it was still in Munich. But they would send\
  \ it in the next flight and deliver my luggage in the address I was staying.\nMy\
  \ luggage arrived in the next day. I was very happy, the city was great, the food\
  \ was delicious, the people were nice, even though English is not their first language,\
  \ most of them know how to speak English very well.\nEven though was my vacation\
  \ time, my friend was working normal, so during the week days I need to explore\
  \ the city by myself. \nFirst day by myself, woke up, took a shower, had breakfast\
  \ and was time to go and explore the city. She had two sets of keys, so she gave\
  \ me one. I took the elevator downstairs and to get out off the building I needed\
  \ to unlock a door. I was there for minutes trying, I had lost how many times I\
  \ tried to open it. Finally, I see an old man going to the \"mail drawers\" and\
  \ I asked him in English \" Hi, how are you? I am having a hard time to open this\
  \ door, would mind helping me open it?\" . He looked at me and just shake his head\
  \ like a no, and pointing to his mouth. That means he didn't know how to speak English,\
  \ and that's how I made my first local Connection, I used my hands to try to explain\
  \ to him what I needed and he helped me out, from that moment on everyday we would\
  \ meet he would say \"moi (hello)\" to me.\nHelsinki was great, in this same trip\
  \ I went to Stockholm that was great and from there we took a ship to Turku in Finland\
  \ and that was great. It was two weeks of adventures and great time with great people."
