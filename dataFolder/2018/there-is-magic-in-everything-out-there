Text: "Please, close your eyes, take a deep breath and try to picture the Ecuadorian\
  \ Amazon Rainforest ! Ready ? Sorry, you\xB4re not even close, because this is beyond\
  \ everything you could ever imagine.\nI was looking for a true adventure when I\
  \ identified a lodge in the jungle and thought it would be perfect for a 'getting\
  \ out of my comfort zone' project. So after 3 flight connections, a sordid airbnb,\
  \ a 10 hours bus journey from Quito to Ahuano, a canoe ride on the Napo River with\
  \ a 60k backpack, I finally arrived at the most unique and splendid setting to uproot\
  \ myself. \nComfortably nestled in the heart of a luxuriant flora, rocked by diverse\
  \ tones of tropical fauna, everyday I was blessed by an amazing view over the Napo\
  \ and surrounding hills. And every night the wildlife woke up to enthral me with\
  \ its jungle symphony.\nI had read that the Amazon Rainforest hosts around 2.5 million\
  \ insect species, so I knew it wouldn't be easy for a city-dweller to be in amongst\
  \ a whole bunch of frightening and disproportionate insects. So I tried to focus\
  \ only on beautiful and colourful things. Thankfully, there is magic in everything\
  \ out there !\nBesides the serenity of the magnificent Pachamama (Mother Nature),\
  \ there's also the fascinating atmosphere created by indigenous traditions and believes.\
  \ I am a sceptical, so the least I expected was to experience a spiritual moment.\
  \ But I spent an amazing day with a Shaman, guardian of a biological knowledge transmitted\
  \ through generations of Rainforest survivors. I learned that within a half square\
  \ kilometer you could find over 1,100 species of trees. And that's why an expert\
  \ eye could see around 250 bird species in a day. He taught me how to crush up termites\
  \ to make a powerful mosquito repellent. Or, how they treat digestion problems by\
  \ eating crushed papaya seeds to eliminate parasites and toxins. Very useful when\
  \ there's no drugstore around...\nAfter sunset, he offered me a 'limpieza del alma'\
  \ ceremony, consisting in cleaning the overloads of negative energies. Somehow he\
  \ managed to expel harmful vibes accumulated in my body. Suddenly, I felt lighter\
  \ as though I could physically feel relieved. Even more surprising, he helped me\
  \ through meditation to establish a path between the consciousness I had of my limited\
  \ body and Pachamama. All my senses were more accurate, I could see through the\
  \ dark jungle night, I could hear animals more distinctly and feel the air caressing\
  \ each pore of my skin, one of the most intense experience ever."
