Text: "It was some 30 hours by bus through the Andes into the Peruvian Amazon basin,\
  \ then a three-day sail upstream by riverboat to Iquitos, the largest city on earth\
  \ to which there are no roads. \n\nThe decision to venture to the jungled metropolis\
  \ was made for me after a freak mudslide closed Machu Picchu. That night, I went\
  \ searching aimlessly for adventure, wandering the cobbled streets of Cusco fatefully\
  \ into a bright, noisy tattoo parlour in the midst of a drunken poker party. Empty\
  \ bottles of pisco and Coke for 'piscolas' fuelled one raucous bet after another.\
  \ In front of me, I fixated on a beer poster taped to a mirror advertising the qualities\
  \ of a particular pilsner with an Amazonian bikini model whose gaze felt magnetically\
  \ set on me.\n\n\"Peruana,\" laughed one of the players, ribbing me with his thumb.\
  \ Others chuckled. \n\nPeruana, like 'piranha,' is a pun describing women of Peru's\
  \ jungle, whose legendary beauty is often used to sell beer and cigarettes and can\
  \ apparently be a dangerous thing. They're said to sink their proverbial teeth into\
  \ you and never let go.\n\n\"Cuidado,\" said another, adding poetically: \"She will\
  \ break your neck with a kiss.\"\n\nThe table roared. Instantly a Plan B formed:\
  \ If I couldn't see the Lost City of the Incas, I would visit Iquitos, the mythical\
  \ City of Peruanas.\n\nPuttering up a chocolate-milky Amazon, I met Pierre from\
  \ France, who'd been here once before and was acclimatized to the temperature judging\
  \ by his sweat stain-less shirt. When we docked, the heat hit me from the boiling\
  \ lava-hot asphalt. Iquitos hasn't many cars but zillions of zipping two-stroke,\
  \ three-wheeled motocarros and motorbikes, giving it the frenetic feel of a fume-filled\
  \ go-kart track. Pierre was unfazed and had zero sweat streaming down his face.\
  \ Strangers meanwhile looked at me worryingly. Pierre returned to see Roc\xEDo,\
  \ who greeted us with her sister Mich\xE8ne. She cracked a joke in Spanish I didn't\
  \ get, then with a handkerchief sponged my brow pityingly. As a token of appreciation\
  \ and to break the ice, so to speak, I got four ice cream cones from a street vendor.\
  \ I returned seconds later and cartoonishly held four soggy napkins of what was\
  \ once ice cream. We set off for a mariposario\u2014or butterfly zoo\u2014Roc\xED\
  o and Mich\xE8ne each on their own dirt bikes. They graciously doubled Pierre and\
  \ I, respectively, zigzagging through the molten core of downtown, when a midday\
  \ rain mercifully drowned the heat, drenching us and washing the melty stickiness\
  \ from our hands. TBC."
