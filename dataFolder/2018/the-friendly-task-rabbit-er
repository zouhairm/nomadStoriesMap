Text: "I was posted to Naperville (a suburb of Chicago) on work in 2016. The lack\
  \ of public transport was a disturbing realization. I found that I'd to own a car\
  \ or simply take a cab everywhere.\n\nWhen setting up house, I ordered everything\
  \ I needed online, everything delivered home! The horrifying part came when my huge\
  \ mattress had to be returned and I was told to take it back myself! Having to find\
  \ local help, I scoured the internet desperately! Hearing of The Task Rabbit, I\
  \ found a local who willing to help out. On the evening of my appointment with John,\
  \ I was surprised by his pleasant smile. We struck up a conversation that kept flowing\
  \ all the while that John weighed my beastly mattress, got it packed up, carrying\
  \ it down the atrociously narrow staircase to his car.\n\nHe opened the back doors\
  \ and while he\u2019d push the now neatly-packaged mattress inside from one end,\
  \ it would simply pop out the other every time! Laughing at this, he quickly got\
  \ out his tools for Plan B! With supreme efficiency, he put the mattress up on his\
  \ car\u2019s roof and tied it up! As John began driving, the silly thing swerved\
  \ all over! We sighed with relief when he finally parked at the store!\n\nGetting\
  \ the beast off, we made the return. I thanked him and while parting ways, he asked\
  \ how I planned on getting home. I said I\u2019d book a cab! John said my house\
  \ was simply on his way back and he'd drop me back! Eventually, I accepted the generous\
  \ offer. When he started the drive back, we got chatting. John was astounded that\
  \ I could communicate in English, despite being from India. I told him that most\
  \ cities in India had English in school. He was curious about Indian languages.\
  \ I told him every state had a language of its own with several dialects! John was\
  \ very curious about learning as much as possible.\n\nFor my questions, he told\
  \ me he helped people with their tasks, apart from his regular job. He\u2019d done\
  \ several transports, helping people move their furniture. We discussed the nature\
  \ of our respective jobs before getting off! I warmly thanked him for helping, John\
  \ felt happy learning about a nation he would visit. John informed me that I could\
  \ call for his help anytime, after which he drove off smilingly. It was enriching\
  \ to understand a local and be understood. I carry the memory of this happy-go-lucky\
  \ Task Rabbit-er, wishing to make more friends wherever I go, seeking further nourishing\
  \ experiences while meeting delightful people around the world!\n\nAfter all, Knowledge\
  \ only grows when shared."
