Text: "I smiled, swinging my legs off the bench outside a humble, wooden cottage.\
  \ I observed the timeworn golden pagodas peeking out from the wall of green rain\
  \ forest before me, a shallow brook murmuring nearby. Chickens roamed around a group\
  \ of muddy, barefoot children standing in the yard. Keeping safe distance, they\
  \ curiously observed me and agitatedly whispered. I couldn\u2019t believe what just\
  \ happened.\n\nHitchhiking in Thailand was meant to be a piece of cake. But was\
  \ it? The first car I hailed ruined my whole trip. A seemingly kind man halted his\
  \ car after a mere ten minutes of sticking my thumb in the air. \u2018Bangkok?\u2019\
  \ I expectantly asked, hoping to reach the Thai capital by sunset. \u2018No problem!\u2019\
  \ the driver exclaimed. \n\nAn hour drive and a difficult conversation in simplified\
  \ English later, Thanapon (as he introduced himself) softly tapped his pocket. \u2018\
  Money\u2019, he demanded smilingly in response to my perplexed stare. In Southeast\
  \ Asia locals often assumed foreigners had thick wallets.\n\n\u2018No have\u2019\
  , I shrugged. Suddenly, the smile was gone from his face. He slammed the brakes\
  \ abruptly and screamed \u2018OUT!\u2019 Baffled, I looked at him but he shrieked\
  \ even louder, pointing his trembling index finger at the door.\n\nNot wanting trouble,\
  \ I obediently got off and reached for the back door to take my backpack. However,\
  \ before I even touched the handle, puff! \u2013 the tires screeched and the car\
  \ disappeared around the bend. Bewildered and lost, I gazed at the empty road in\
  \ the middle of nowhere. I didn\u2019t smile.\nI desolately trudged on the road,\
  \ almost hearing the sizzling early-afternoon heat. I didn\u2019t even have water.\
  \ There were no shops, no passersby, no cars whizzing past. When my hopes hit rock\
  \ bottom after four-hour peregrination, I rested below vast banana tree leaves and\
  \ exhaled exhaustively. Suddenly, a pickup truck materialized. I jumped onto the\
  \ road. \n\n\u2018Help, please\u2019 I desperately begged. A dark-skinned adolescent\
  \ with sparse beard looked at me with pity and then gave me a beaming smile. \u2018\
  Come my friend\u2019, he offered. \u2018My name is Ben\u2019.\n\nBen helped his\
  \ mother prepare dinner as I sat on the bench, musing about my adventure. Suddenly,\
  \ a roaring car engine broke the peaceful ambiance and Ploy, Ben\u2019s little sister,\
  \ ran past me with... my backpack! I turned around. Ben approached me, hands full\
  \ with shopping bags. \u2018Jake, meet my brother \u2013 Thanapon\u2019.\n\nI watched\
  \ as the man nonchalantly paced the yard. When he saw me, he froze and... smiled.\n\
  \nIt was the last thing I expected."
