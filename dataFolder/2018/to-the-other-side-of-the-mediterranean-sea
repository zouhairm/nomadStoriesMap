Text: "I live in a coastal city called Oran, since I was a kid, I've always dreamed\
  \ of exploring what's behind the sea, I see it every day, my high-school had a view\
  \ of the seaport, so every day, I check the boats, I was always wondering how Europe\
  \ looks like, many young Algerians cross the sea in a nearly impossible attempt\
  \ to reach Europe, chasing an illusion, a better life. \n\nMore than two years ago,\
  \ my friend died trying to cross the sea; to reach Spain, he didn't say a word,\
  \ he just went, I remember we played soccer match some couple of days before they\
  \ take off, then I heard about what happened weeks later, they didn't find the body,\
  \ I could have helped to prevent it, if he only told me, I was his friend, I couldn't\
  \ believe it, I always had hope, that he could've reached his destination, I wish\
  \ he did.\n\nI decided to go to see what Spain looks like, I got a visa rejection\
  \ from the Spanish embassy, I tried with the French embassy, and they granted me\
  \ a visa after waiting 8 months for an appointment, and two months for a reply,\
  \ I worked for a year to afford a round-trip boat ticket, and 100 \u20AC from the\
  \ black market, and a backpack.\n\nI finally was going to experience a boat trip\
  \ for the first time, I didn't feel sea-sickness though, I was so excited to reach\
  \ the destination, I took with me my friend's favorite football t-shirt, he loved\
  \ Barcelona football club, his family gave it to me.\n\nHere we're, the boat has\
  \ arrived in Barcelona seaport, the queue is quite long, I was so afraid, there\
  \ has been a terrorist attack in Las Ramblas, my name is typically Arab, Muslim,\
  \ and I'm also black, I was just stereotyping.\n\nI'm now in Europe, I couldn't\
  \ believe it, I imagined it in many ways, I started walking, what a different world,\
  \ I was alone, then I met a lot of people over 8 days period, things that I've never\
  \ expected, I spent my first night in 15 \u20AC room, a Moroccan hotel, I met three\
  \ Germans the first night in Pla\xE7a Real, I met an American traveler twice in\
  \ the same day, in two different places, we shared a pizza, we both were backpackers,\
  \ we just remained together, we couchsurfed, we met three other travelers from Australia,\
  \ Germany, and the US. \n\nFrom a lonely guy to sharing a paella in an international\
  \ dinner. I just couldn't believe it!\n\nHamza was with me all the way through his\
  \ t-shirt, I went to Camp Nou, I set for a moment and had a thought; is that what\
  \ my people are dying for? Is that what my friend died for? It's great, but it's\
  \ not paradise..."
