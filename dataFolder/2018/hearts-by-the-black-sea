Text: "I lived in Bucharest for a year, working for Ngos in exchange for accommodation.\
  \ \nHowever these lines are not about Romania, about what happened after, in Bulgaria,\
  \ where last summer I spent two months on the Black Sea working in a movie festival.\
  \ \nOnce in Balchik, the final destination, I got lost with other volunteers, unable\
  \ to find anyone who could speak English, carrying our suitcases in the dirt at\
  \ 5 in the morning after the bus driver made us get off in the wrong place. Under\
  \ the rain, we found shelter in a gypsy neighborhood and help in two policemen that\
  \ took the only black guy among us to the police station, since they never saw a\
  \ black person and this explains how remote was our destination. In Balchik, we\
  \ lived with 80 volunteers from all over Europe in a creepy hospital for children,\
  \ full of centipedes, no internet, a small plastic bowl as wash machine and cucumbers\
  \ (that non of us has the courage to eat anymore) at every meal. \nWe starved for\
  \ two months without working that much, since there were no tourists interested\
  \ in the festival; everyone was complaining except for me: I always like adventures,\
  \ even if after washing my clothes in our dirty bathroom I saw them flying away\
  \ in a sudden storm. \nI had the time to process my Romanian experience and pushed\
  \ others to visit Romania, only 3 hours away from where we were drinking beer in\
  \ the morning due to a water shortage. \nWe were jogging trying not to step on green\
  \ snakes, waving at dolphins and using our free days to travel, from Veliko Tarnovo\
  \ to Belgrade, where on the Danube\u2019s waterfront we realized it was unfortunately\
  \ time to go back. \nWhat makes me recall fondly Balchik is the palace where the\
  \ festival was located, the quiet nest of Queen Marie of Romania: a small castle\
  \ on the beach with a botanic garden where we were partying during the festival\
  \ and I almost broke my ribs whiel dancing drunk. \nAccording to her will, the Queen\u2019\
  s heart was kept in the Palace but after the region became Bulgarian, it was moved\
  \ to Bucharest where I heard about the Queen\u2019s heart without imagining it was\
  \ in Balchik. \nAfter hearing about it, I ran to look where the heart was held:\
  \ a small chapel in poor state. I realised that the important is what there is inside\
  \ the heart, not around it and or where it is kept. Even now that I live in Prague,\
  \ my voice gets shaky when I speak about Romania because that's where my heart is:\
  \ you leave it where you understand something about yourself and the world around\
  \ you."
