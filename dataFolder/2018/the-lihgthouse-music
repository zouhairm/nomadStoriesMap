Text: "Lighthouses have one amazing feature: if you once stood close to at least one\
  \ of them, whether it is big and majestic, or skinny and dilapidated, you\u2019\
  ll get forever the illness called  \"lighthouse fever\". In other words, you will\
  \ be hardly infected with the ineradicable desire to explore its history and learn\
  \ about the fate of those whom it has saved or killed.\nWhen you come close to any\
  \ lighthouse, sure, you will want to touch it\u2019s stone body, painted grey and\
  \ blue by time and the sea, and lean your ear to its cold plates to listen what\
  \ it whispers to you, only you. And after you\u2019ve talked to it you will be forever\
  \ doomed to look for the next lighthouse, and having found that, look for another\
  \ one, second, third. And so on to infinity.\nAnd one day after standing near Kronstadt\
  \ lighthouse in Russia, I picked up this eternal search virus, and now when have\
  \ vacation can\u2019t help roaming the world in search for lighthouses, old and\
  \ modern, opened or closed.\n\nMy recent amazing travel was dedicated to lighthouse\
  \ Ayr in the northernmost point of Wales. It stands on Talacre beach, at the entrance\
  \ to river Dee estuary. It was built in 1776 and became inactive in 1883. Alive,\
  \ it was painted with red and white stripes, and had a red lantern housing. Now\
  \ it is old and abandoned and I thought I would hear its grumbling and moaning.\
  \  When we met, Ayr was silent. But when I came closer I heard music. It was not\
  \ just music played by a man but \u2018something\u2019 created by \u2018someone\
  \ from outside\u2019. \nIt is so hard to describe its playing. When I think of it,\
  \ three words come to my mind: grief, hope, infinity. I read in my guidebook that\
  \ according to the local legend, a Ghost of a man died of love often walks around\
  \ the abandoned lighthouse.\nMy British friends told me later that there is nothing\
  \ mysterious, the music is quite explainable: to support the Ghost legend, the lighthouse\
  \ owner ordered from a local artist Angela Smith a seven-foot sculpture of a Guardian.\
  \ It was made of stainless steel with numerous holes. The wind, passing through\
  \ them, plays on the body of the Guardian the mysterious melody.\nYes, it seems\
  \ to be true. But, believe me, when you talk to Ayr, you never think of any reasonable\
  \ explanation. The melody is really magic. And I am so happy that Ayr talked to\
  \ me by its music! We spoke privately and I promised my new friend to deliver his\
  \ \u201Chello\u201D to other lighthouses, which are on my long travel list."
