Text: "It was my first trip all by myself, so I had to leave all tha fancy all-inclusive\
  \ hotels behind, and do it in my own way. I decided to go to France, a village named\
  \ Saint Emilio. \nWith a sparkle in my eyes and a breath in mt stomach, although\
  \ completely fascinated and intimidated at tha same time by all the idea of freedom,\
  \ I dumpet my backpack at the hostel and stepped out into the night looking for\
  \ one of the Ch\xE2teuax to have some typical macaroons and some wine. \nA few minutes\
  \ later, a young Italian writer, Guido, approached me asking if he may sit with\
  \ me. He couldn't speak English very well and I couldn't speak barely nothing from\
  \ Italian, so we manage to communicate making a crazy combination of languages what\
  \ made us able to understand each other. He offered to be my guide in the vineyards\
  \ and even thought we had met in a ilttle while, we became like instanteneous friends.\
  \ \nAfter a week or so of knowledge about Saint Emilio, we decide to backpack around\
  \ the villages of France, together. It was certainly the most unexpected friendship\
  \ and it was born in a little restaurante drinking some wine. \nHe became my very\
  \ best friend and actually my true backpack partner. Next month we are going on\
  \ board of our second adventure together, this time he will guide me - or try -\
  \ in a road trip through his own country, Italy. We have  already set up next trip\
  \ it will be here in Brazil. \nMy unlikely guide, turned into my professional shill\
  \ at being lost all over the country."
