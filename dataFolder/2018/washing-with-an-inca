Text: "I had just arrived to work on a farm in Yacca, a tiny community in the Apurimac\
  \ region in Peru. El Patr\xF3n had told me I needed a wash. Slightly offended, I\
  \ politely asked where the shower was. \n\n'Ricardo will take you over to it,' he\
  \ smiled a toothless smile. Then, he left the room calling back, 'The shower will\
  \ be strong today. Look after him Ricardo.'\n\nThe day was clear and bright as I\
  \ walked down the road with Ricardo, the oldest of seven siblings of the Huaman\
  \ family. \n\n'We don't have a modern shower Jack. We wash in the river. Our lifestyle\
  \ hasn't changed for many generations.'\n\nThere was a dull, groaning sound of rushing\
  \ water which grew as we walked, drowning out Ricardo's descriptions of how various\
  \ produce on the farm ripens seasonally.\n\nI then saw the Merino river for the\
  \ first time.\n\n'Are you sure that the river isn't flowing too fast today Ricardo?'\
  \ I asked in a higher pitch than usual. \n\nRicardo took off his t-shirt and sandals.\
  \ \n\n'Come,' he striding along the rocky bank of the writhing river. \n\nAfter\
  \ a hundred yards, he stopped. 'Watch, ok? In, wash, out, alright?' pointing to\
  \ a large rock downstream. \n\nBefore I had a chance to reply, he had launched himself.\
  \ \n\nWhile kicking hard underwater, he washed his hair popping out about ten metres\
  \ down from me. Scrubbing, and swimming every now and then, he directed himself\
  \ in the current towards the bank. He then caught the rock with his hands and swung\
  \ himself up effortlessly.\n\nHesitantly, I stood upstream but from the rock, Ricardo\
  \ called 'Let's go Jack! Arriba!' \n\nI couldn't go back to the house without diving\
  \ in. This was an initiation. I nodded to Ricardo and leapt in. \n\nShocked by the\
  \ cold water and propelled by a strong current, I kicked hard until I reached the\
  \ surface. Through coughs, I blurrily saw Ricardo in the distance laughing madly.\
  \ Rather than washing, I focussed on staying afloat. \n\nSwept along, I managed\
  \ to get in to line with the large rock. With shouts of encouragement from Ricardo\
  \ above, I caught hold of the rock's jagged face before I flowed downstream. While\
  \ my upper body was firmly clinging on to the rock, my legs were still caught in\
  \ the current.\n\nI struggled to breath drinking in water. I found a rock to push\
  \ my feet against. After a couple of attempts, I managed to haul myself up the rock\
  \ face and roll on to my back to splutter and cough. \n\n'That was fun,' I said\
  \ to Ricardo after I had recovered.\n\n'You wouldn't be a very good Inca Jack,'\
  \ he replied rubbing away tears of laughter."
