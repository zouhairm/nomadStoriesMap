Text: "The sun pierced through the thin white clouds, radiating the land. It was December.\
  \ Valentin, Juong and I climbed to the top of Children's Palace in Shenzhen. Below,\
  \ children shouted, ran and cried. Finally, peace.\n\nWe spent the weekend in Shenzhen,\
  \ the border city of China. The day before, we had nothing but troubles.\n0030 Supper\n\
  0130 Realise no hotels available\n0150 Found WiFi to check for hotels\n0225 Cafes\
  \ are closing. Phone battery 4%, no phone charger, 350RMB to our names\n\nPhone\
  \ at 2%. I desperately load Agoda. My hands were shaking from the cold. The streets\
  \ were no longer packed like the morning before. It was a ghost town with no rooms.\n\
  \nEventually, my phone gave way. It died. The caf\xE9 was closing. We had to leave.\
  \ It was 0230. We dragged our heavy feet out of the caf\xE9. We walked for almost\
  \ 18km that day, my feet protested every step!\n\nUnfortunately, only sex hotels\
  \ were open. They charged rooms per hour. When you are \"MMF\" it is not the best\
  \ to get a sex hotel to sleep.\n\nAt 0315, we turned a corner and found a pleasant\
  \ looking hotel in the middle of an alley! It looked decent, better than sleazy\
  \ sex hotels. Praying that the hotel is not going to be expensive, we inquired with\
  \ the receptionist.\n\n\"130RMB.\" Her dark long hair was tied up into a neat ponytail.\
  \ Ming, her name tag suggests, lifted her head, sighed loudly and told us that it\
  \ was a two-bedroom studio. We paid in cash immediately, went up and crashed in\
  \ the beds.\n\nThe morning after, we explored the area. There was not a tourist\
  \ in sight! We had absolutely no clue where we were. Google does not work in China.\n\
  \nWe found ourselves back in the bustling city. We reflected on the night before.\
  \ No WiFi, dead phones and no Google. It felt like we could have died.\n\nThen,\
  \ seeing the children with real physical toys, running in the sun and learning how\
  \ to spin a top from their grandmother, you realise something. Technology should\
  \ be a means of assistance.\n\nIt is easy to rely on technology and forget about\
  \ real adventures. Should we have booked a hotel before, we would not have indulged\
  \ in delicious breakfast congee in the back alley in Shenzhen. Nor a two-bedroom\
  \ hotel for US$20 and not seen the sex hotels in Shenzhen.\n\nAdventures are in\
  \ every corner. It is important to give up technology once in a while to appreciate\
  \ the rawness of the world. It is not every day where you see children playing with\
  \ spinning tops and running in the sun. In Hong Kong and Singapore, children spin\
  \ their tops on iPads."
