Text: "Every country smells different, too. Hawke\u2019s Bay, surprisingly, smelled\
  \ like my mother. Its vegetated slopes and valleys looked fertile and the Sun was\
  \ stoutly heating up the air. The air got confused: fierce westerly winds constantly\
  \ displace it, and now this potent January day-star makes everything perspire. \u201C\
  Why?\u201D the air blew a whistle. \n\nThe whistling started after I had arrived\
  \ at the smallest airport of my life. It was full of light and placidity and nothing\
  \ else. The message was clear: \u201CYou are not in Auckland or Wellington. Here\
  \ we listen to the air, the Sun and the mountains. Sit down and drink wine with\
  \ us. Don\u2019t get flurried! Calm down! \u201D And I calmed down. My friend looked\
  \ at me suspiciously. She still could not register that I flew all the way to New\
  \ Zealand to see her. \u201CYou are here,\u201D she said.\n\nThe mother smell was\
  \ coming from the ocean. Those vicious winds, the Roaring Forties, made the water\
  \ wave, made it look all sweaty and busy and grouchy. The air was salty. Every evening\
  \ we would spend on a porch, with wine glasses comforted between our index and middle\
  \ fingers. I inquired whether they do anything but drink around here. \u201CWe plant\
  \ flowers, occasionally,\u201D Sam said contemplating her deep ruby image in the\
  \ glass. \u201CMostly Russell lupins.\u201D Those are my mother's favorite.\n\n\u201C\
  There are no wars in New Zealand,\u201D my friend said. \u201CWe had the Maori Battalion\
  \ during World War II, you could see Maori men kneeling, performing haka in Greece\
  \ and North Afrika.\u201D She took a sip. \u201CBut the air is peaceful here.\u201D\
  \n\nWe flew to the city without having our luggage scanned. In Wellington I saw\
  \ some buildings taller than two stories for the first time since my arrival to\
  \ the country. New Zealanders are too relaxed and peaceful to conquer nature. Tall\
  \ buildings block the Sun. \u201CThat\u2019s not good enough,\u201D whistled the\
  \ Sun, the mountains and the air. My mother would agree. Tall buildings take away\
  \ the space that could otherwise be planted with Russell lupins.\n\nThe narrow road\
  \ dodged under the wheels. \u201CDid they shoot that hobbit village somewhere here?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CNo, that\u2019s on the South Island,\u201D Sam answered. \u201C\
  They have more mountains over there.\u201D \nAlthough she never lied to me before,\
  \ I knew that there is no place with more mountains than this here land. No other\
  \ place with as much sun and air as well.\n\u201CSay hi to your mom, will you?\u201D\
  \ said Sam. \u201CI\u2019ll be back soon. Don\u2019t drink without me,\u201D I replied.\
  \ We were used to farewells. \u201CDeal!\u201D she lied for the second time."
