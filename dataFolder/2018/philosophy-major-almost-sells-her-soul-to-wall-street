Text: "I stared at the Empire State Building for the first time in my life, and instead\
  \ of feeling excitement and joy, I felt disappointment and defeat. It was my first\
  \ time in New York \u2013 a city that I\u2019ve only seen in movies or dreamed about.\
  \ The fifteen-year-old in me, who used to stroll the streets of the East Village\
  \ through Google Maps Satellite View, was frustratingly trying to shake away the\
  \ gloom that present me felt. \n\nWhy the gloom? I managed to land a job in New\
  \ York with a startup that paid way beyond a college sophomore\u2019s expectations.\
  \ I didn\u2019t even care what the job was \u2013 I think the founder said it was\
  \ something to do with business development or marketing. I don\u2019t even know.\
  \ Before my one-way flight from Buenos Aires to New York, I received an email that\
  \ changed the trajectory of my entire summer. \n\nThe startup bailed on me. They\
  \ were going bankrupt, so obviously they couldn\u2019t hire an intern. When I received\
  \ the email, my vision blurred and I felt my world crumbling down. What do I do\
  \ now? \n\nFind another job? This late in the application cycle? I\u2019d be able\
  \ to land a minimum wage job, maybe. But it would still have to be relevant to my\
  \ major. I can\u2019t flip burgers on an F-1 visa. \n\nI also had no place to stay\
  \ and no money to afford anything. I slept from couch to couch to buy myself some\
  \ time to make the decision to stay or leave New York. I managed to buy myself three\
  \ weeks to decide \u2013 after which, I would have no place to stay or any money\
  \ to live. \n\nI reached out to everyone I knew \u2013 people who didn\u2019t even\
  \ live in New York but may have contacts who did. Eventually, I landed an interview\
  \ with a commercial bank on Park Avenue. Bear in mind that I am a philosophy major,\
  \ have taken one introductory level finance course, and barely understood the consumer\
  \ banking industry, let alone commercial banking. \n\nI left the fancy bank building\
  \ with a minimum wage job offer and a hunch in my stomach that my fantasy of living\
  \ in New York would be crushed if I take a job that I don\u2019t want (or am qualified\
  \ for). Logically, I knew it did not make sense for me to stay in New York as much\
  \ as my heart wanted to. \n\nMy hands were tied, so I booked myself a one-way ticket\
  \ to London and spent the rest of the summer couch surfing around Europe and working\
  \ remotely for a digital publication \u2013 at the same rate the bank had promised\
  \ me."
