Text: "September 26 2014. It\u2019s my birthday. And the only person I saw today was\
  \ this lady who gave me my first own passport. I don\u2019t think I could have dream\
  \ of a better gift! But this, I didn\u2019t know it yet. \n\nAugust 22 2015. Tonight\
  \ I\u2019m sleeping on a bench in the middle of Thailand..\n\nWait WHAT ? \n\nI\
  \ never saw that coming.\nBut that should not surprise me: I never see anything\
  \ coming. I guess that\u2019s because I stopped expecting things to happen or not\
  \ in my life. I mean why bother? It\u2019s always gonna surprise us anyway. I should\
  \ know because no one, myself included, imagined my life to turn out to be this\
  \ one. \n\nBut I wasn\u2019t brave enough to run across the world without a backup\
  \ plan so I settled to become an au pair in a neighboring European country. At least\
  \ that was the plan\u2026\nSo imagine when a couple of months later, I actually\
  \ landed in a country where I couldn\u2019t even recognize the characters on the\
  \ road signs, where the trees were higher than the buildings I used to see around\
  \ me and where you had to break your neck to be able to see the top of the building.\
  \  Of course, no surprise when the next day, the only answer I could give to the\
  \ question \u201CWhat do you think of China so far?\u201D was it\u2019s Big!\n\n\
  And that\u2019s how it all started, that\u2019s when I decided to NOT expect anything\
  \ anymore because all it does is spoiling the surprise of life. And also, because\
  \ it\u2019s impossible. \n\nNever in my entire life would I have expected to meet\
  \ the one to be my soulmate from Mexico in China. Never would I have expected to\
  \ be able to eat slippery noodles with chopsticks like a pro. Never would I have\
  \ expected to slide down the Great Wall of China! Never would I have expected to\
  \ take a mud bath in a cave, to eat a scorpion, to go to Hong Kong by metro, to\
  \ try (and fail) to learn mandarin, to make cr\xEApes without milk, to observe a\
  \ battle dance of flashy dragons, and the list goes on and on. \n\nAnd where is\
  \ Thailand in all that will you ask me, right? \nThat\u2019s my point: it\u2019\
  s pointless to expect anything in life. Because you never know what the future may\
  \ hold and if it can be scary sometimes, it\u2019s not only fear, it\u2019s also\
  \ a bit of excitement with a flavor of adventure sprinkled with just the right amount\
  \ of mystery that make every and each travel a great story. \n\nSure, never in my\
  \ life would I have thought myself capable of traveling alone in Thailand and even\
  \ sleep on a bench there, but that\u2019s what happen, and I can\u2019t wait to\
  \ to be surprised with the next last thing I expected."
