Text: "\xABZoe, please take the shoulder bag\xBB.\n\xABOk Daddy\xBB.\nRoger and Frederika\
  \ had left the car at the point where the plain changed. The vegetation became rich\
  \ and flourishing with a forest of oaks and junipers. On the left there was Mountain\
  \ Tiscali.\nFrederika, Zoe and Roger began to climb, behind them the rest of the\
  \ group, about twenty people. Their hiking boots made their way through the path,\
  \ crunching between stones and dry branches.\n\xABWhat will we find on the mountain?\xBB\
  \ Asked Zoe.\n\xABInside a sinkhole we should find the remains of an ancient Nuragic\
  \ village over 2500 years ago old\xBB.\n\xABWow, I expect some skull and maybe a\
  \ treasure. I cannot wait to get to the top\xBB. Said Zoe smiling and speeding up\
  \ the pace.\nThe light filtered faintly from the branches of the holm oaks and the\
  \ scent of the undergrowth made the climb pleasant. The granite mountain appeared\
  \ on the left, on the right there was the valley they had travelled by car. Their\
  \ view of the plains could be miles away, lost in vineyards, woods and bushes of\
  \ cistus. They stopped for a moment to see the view on a small clearing of the path\
  \ overlooking the valley. Roger approached the precipice to take a picture, right\
  \ next to a juniper tree that had its stem knotted on itself.\n\xABHey Roger, watch\
  \ out\xBB Frederika shouted.\nRoger took a step back, but Zoe approached, slipped\
  \ on a rock and fell down.\n\xABZoe\xBB Frederika shouted with his hands in her\
  \ hair.\nRoger grabbed Zoe's jacket and managed to stop her by a whisker, but his\
  \ phone fell to the ground and went to pieces.\n\xABI'm sorry Dad\xBB Zoe said softly,\
  \ hugging her father and receiving a hug from her mother.\nThe incident did not\
  \ let the good mood pass. After a narrow passage between two very long rocks they\
  \ reached the top of the mountain. A hole with stone stairs opened beneath them.\
  \ Frederika, Zoe and Roger suddenly realized that they were alone, no trace of the\
  \ group that had been following them. Zoe first sighted the Nuragic village \xAB\
  Amazing\xBB. The houses were made of stones with thatched roof, but seemed to be\
  \ just built. Roger looked up from the steps to give a look and almost fell to the\
  \ ground with amazement. The perfectly preserved village stood in front of them.\
  \ How was it possible? There should have been only ruins. At that moment, some men\
  \ dressed in a deerskin appeared near the houses. Frederika, was scared, looked\
  \ at Roger as he held Zoe tight. \xABIt's better to leave\xBB. Said Roger under\
  \ his breath. \n\xABSk'el' r Sharden\xBB a man shouted behind them, pointing a spear."
