  \ the Bazaar\"I say to the driver. My Mandarin skills are passable, the taxi driver\
  \ acknowledges my command, and with a toothy smile and twinkle in his eye we take\
  \ off. However in the opposite direction I thought we had to go. Oh well, in this\
  \ part of the world, going with flow is necessary. My trip of a life time to Western\
  \ Asia is all about embracing the unexpected and throwing away assumptions.\nXinjiang,\
  \ Kashgar a dusty, hot, grape growing Silk Road outpost. An ethnic Uyghur Turkic-speaking\
  \ Muslim region of China.  A magnificent region where East and West collide in colorful\
  \ and lively hub bub of buying and trading goods from across the Euro-Asiatic Steppe.\
  \ The Bazaar is the best place to go for people watching,eating delectable lamb\
  \ kabobs and Kashgar flatbread. The first time I encountered Uyghur cuisine, saved\
  \ my life. A few months back I arrived in a small town dehydrated with altitude\
  \ sickness.Unable to handle another Tibetan Momo, I discovered a little restaurant\
  \ and inn run by Uyghur's. A tiny and spotless hole-in the wall with the most warm\
  \ and welcoming family, and out of this world soup. The lamb broth mixed with local\
  \ vegetables and thick noodles instantly soothed my aching stomach. Now at the present\
  \ moment, I'm racing down the road in a taxi to a Bazaar. We zip by rows of giant\
  \ poplar trees and women wearing head scarves travel slowly on horse and cart  behind\
  \ us. Finally the taxi driver stops abruptly in what seems like the middle of nowhere.\
  \ Tumbling out of the taxi with my bag, and camera and look around cautiously. I\
  \  pay him 20 Yuen and ask him to wait. I spy a small market with a few sellers\
  \ and a couple food stalls. I think  \"Is this it?\" \"This is the famous famous\
  \ Kashgar Bazaar?\" I start to realize I have been......how would you say \"lead\
  \ down the wrong path\" I laugh at my gullible innocence mind an  wander into a\
  \ one table establishment run by a husband, wife and daughter. I sheepishly sit\
  \ down. I wonder to myself \"Am I welcome here\", being a loan woman traveler. The\
  \ man comes out from the kitchen and looks at me with what I perceive as an angry\
  \ intense stare and yells something in Uyghur. He darts back into the kitchen. .A\
  \ minute later he comes back with a huge bowl of grapes and plunks it on my table.\
  \ He winks at me and says \"Welcome\" My heart and mind open up a little bit more\
  \ at that moment.  I didn't make it to the Kashgar Bazaar that day, but I got an\
  \ unexpected glimpse into life rarely seen by outsiders."
