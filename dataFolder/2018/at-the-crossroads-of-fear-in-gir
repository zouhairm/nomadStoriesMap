Text: "Crouched midst the Hadmatiya farms, I clasped my knee in multiple fears as\
  \ my eyes searched for the glimpse of lions.\n\nAfter a 'lion-less' jungle safari\
  \ in Gir, I decided to go to Hadmatiya Village, about 25kms from Gir, where the\
  \ lazy lions, reportedly, napped in the afternoons. Gir happens to be the only place\
  \ in India where lions are found in their natural habitat.\n\n\u2018Outsiders rarely\
  \ come here to spot lions,\u2019 uttered the young farm boy (in Gujarati) while\
  \ casually twisting a twig in his mouth. It was an arid yet surprisingly dense farm.\
  \ Seven farmers and I headed inside. The deeper we went, the farther I came from\
  \ the main road not realizing that I was the only woman in the pact, unaware of\
  \ the routes of the farm, accompanied by strange men. Our pact leader, a tall, cold-eyed\
  \ man, asked us to shush by signing a finger on his lips. It was then that the farm\
  \ boy babbled, \u2018We\u2019ve never had women here for a glimpse of lions.\u2019\
  \ There was a peculiar awe in his eyes that I did not wish to decipher.\n\n\nI wasn\u2019\
  t so much afraid of the lions on the farm now as much as being cordoned up by strange\
  \ men! We had been walking for over an hour now with no certain sign of the animal.\
  \ Was I being tricked into a ruse?\n\nI am an Indian city girl, curious, friendly\
  \ and I am ready to trust strangers in an unknown town. I've grown up in a society\
  \ where the fear of mishap, of never trusting strangers, especially men, was instilled\
  \ in my grooming. All of this didn\u2019t strike me until that moment where as hard\
  \ as I tried to see the lion, which our pact leader had finally spotted, I couldn\u2019\
  t. And then he said, calling me close,\u2018Bend Over.\u2019\n\n\nSeven men circled\
  \ me; no way out. I couldn\u2019t even run away for the fear of lion turned me stone\
  \ cold. Was there really a lion in this farm or were there going to be seven animals\
  \ pouncing on me in no time? I trusted beyond my silently aggravated paranoia and\
  \ bent over. In no time there was an upset movement all around.\n\nAnd then, I saw\
  \ the eyes! The eyes came running towards me. A bulky golden-haired lion halted\
  \ just 15 feet away and roared. His coal black eyes stared at mine and a majestic\
  \ stillness followed. My gasp stuck in my throat. And then there was the second\
  \ roar. Slowly we stepped back and exited the farm. The farm boy had wet his pants.\
  \ I was cold sweating. I couldn\u2019t forget those eyes and then there was the\
  \ final roar echoing the farm.\n\n'The lion gives three threat calls before attacking,'\
  \ I was told later."
