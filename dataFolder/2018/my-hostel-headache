Text: "I've had some strange encounters in hostels all over Australia, including the\
  \ time I came across a Nun who prayed at random hours of the night. It is pretty\
  \ scary being awoken by a fully robed figure performing ancient rituals in the middle\
  \ of a dorm at 3 in the morning, believe me. But nothing prepared me for the the\
  \ night I spent at a Hostel in Canberra.\n\u201CJoe\u201D, an unpredictable (think\
  \ of the guy from the film Full Metal Jacket), self-appointed tour-guide for unsuspecting\
  \ travellers through his native town, is one of those people who likes to be in\
  \ everyone\u2019s business and insists on endlessly talking to anyone he can corner.\
  \ On this particular night, we would have the displeasure of sharing a room with\
  \ him.\nAt around 1am, we're all awoken to a lad screaming \u201Cah good Jesus,\
  \ please God, no, a calf spasm!\u201D. After my initial fright wore off, I burst\
  \ out laughing. But upon turning over to go back to sleep, I noticed some crazy\
  \ snoring coming from across the room. Peering into the darkness, I see that this\
  \ explosive sound is coming from \u201CJoe\u201D. It's so loud that my sister Sinead\
  \ has to go downstairs to buy ear plugs.\nBut no sooner has the snoring stopped\
  \ when \u201CJoe\u201D starts having a gibberish conversation with himself. We become\
  \ tense and a little on edge as he gets louder and louder. Suddenly, Joe jumps out\
  \ of bed and falls flat onto the ground, only to pick himself up and continue moving,\
  \ wildebeest-style, around the room. Finally, he stumbles out into the hallway and\
  \ we all breathe a sigh of relief.\nBut before I can turn back over, he returns\
  \ to the foot of my bed, inducing a terror in me that I have never felt before or\
  \ since. On the cusp of losing my mind, he makes his way back to his own bed, but\
  \ on the way there, he collapses over a chair. Recovering himself, and now with\
  \ renewed vigor, bounds towards me. Trembling with one eye open, I envision the\
  \ worst. But as he climbs up onto my bunk bed, I scream \u201Cwhat the hell are\
  \ you doing?\u201D and assume a murderous pose. \u201CSorry, wrong bed\u201D he\
  \ dazedly replies before climbing down on top of my friend Anita. \u201CIt\u2019\
  s not this one either,\u201D she nervously intones. Eventually, a lad from across\
  \ the room screams \u201CIt\u2019s this one over here\u201D.\nWith an hour remaining\
  \ before I have to go to work, Calf-spasm boy decides that now is the best time\
  \ to throw himself onto the floor with another agonising calf muscle attack. Suffice\
  \ to say, I went to work that day, over-exhausted, underpaid and vowing never to\
  \ return to the hostel life again."
