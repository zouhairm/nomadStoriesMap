Text: "I can\u2019t remember what day it was or even the date. All I remember is that\
  \ on this day we decided to be spontaneous and drive down to a nudist beach. I\u2019\
  ve always wanted to go because I liked the idea of being nude and not feeling bashful.\
  \ I also I figured it would give me an adrenaline rush since its not something that\u2019\
  s often done and its not exactly legal. But the idea of a nudist beach, where you\
  \ can be publicly nude and not be persecuted for it and where you can be free in\
  \ your own skin around other people who couldn\u2019t care less about how you look\
  \ or look at you in a sexual way. Well, at least that\u2019s the expectation I had.\
  \ Seemed like an amazing idea at the time.\n\nI think it must have been a Monday\
  \ because I remember that morning we woke up at Halit\u2019s home, his brother and\
  \ sister had gone to school and his parents were at work. We woke up, got dressed\
  \ and drove to Sandy Bay beach. It was Ellie, Halit and I in the car. We had packed\
  \ snacks in case we got hungry. It was a long drive because we weren\u2019t exactly\
  \ sure where we were going but a pleasant one nonetheless. We drove in between houses.\
  \ It was an elite area and the houses were a dream. As we drove, I would look out\
  \ the window and imagine myself living in those houses and wonder what kind of people\
  \ lived in them, too. The music in the car, as always, was on blast and we danced\
  \ and sang along like your typical varsity students getting up to no good.\n\nThe\
  \ way there was filled with hills going up and down. Ellie\u2019s car was small\
  \ and inexpensive and considering the area we were at, we were clearly three middle\
  \ class varsity students who were out of place but alas we did not care. We could\
  \ see the beach from the hill top as we drove. We had arrived. We parked the car\
  \ next to a house that under construction (as if those houses needed anymore renovations).\
  \ We got out the car carrying our snacks and some beach towels. We saw a man standing\
  \ there and we asked him for directions, \u201Cfollow the pathway all the way through\
  \ and you will see the beach right at the end. Good luck.\u201D, he said. Good luck?\
  \ What did he mean by good luck? I was soon to find to find out.\n\nAs we walked\
  \ along the narrow pathway, I began to panic. The walk was long and tedious and\
  \ seemed to not lead anywhere. The ground was muddy and the trees were too tall.\
  \ We finally arrived after hiking up a couple of rocks. The beach was quiet and\
  \ felt kind of dodgy. There were surfers and just one man laying on one of the rocks,\
  \ naked. It was nothing like I expected."
