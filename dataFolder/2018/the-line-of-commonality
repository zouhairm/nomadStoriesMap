Text: "My boots raise little pillows of dust from the road. There is a river below\
  \ me, and I think of the fly rod strapped ostentatiously to my pack. If I wasn\u2019\
  t so tired, I could scramble down the dry, rocky slope and catch something to eat.\n\
  But I am tired\u2014exhausted, actually. I\u2019ve been walking for 5 days, with\
  \ 65lbs of food and gear strapped to my back. I hiked out of a national reserve\
  \ the night before, then hitched a ride to a signpost saying, Reserva Nacional Jeinimeni,\
  \ 50km. I have 2 weeks left on my solo trek through the mountains of Chilean Patagonia.\n\
  My knees ache. The pack chafes my low back and shoulders. I had counted on catching\
  \ a ride to reserve, but the road is long, empty, and quiet. At the 33km mark, I\
  \ stop.\n\u201CAh, hell,\u201D I say to the silence and the red mountains. \u201C\
  I\u2019m not gonna make it.\u201D I stand in the middle of the road, completely\
  \ drained. I just\u2014can\u2019t walk anymore. I throw my pack in the dirt and\
  \ sprawl on top of it. Turning onto my belly, I dig for food. \nWhen they stop,\
  \ I\u2019m sitting in the dust, slowly chewing a can of tuna. It\u2019s two men\
  \ in a pickup truck. They\u2019re heading to town, the opposite direction as me.\
  \ They ask which way I\u2019m going. \u201CA la reserva,\u201D I say, and the driver\
  \ starts to pull away. I roll off my pack.\nHis eyes, dark brown like muddy water,\
  \ spark with interest as he taps the brake. \u201CYou fish?\u201D He\u2019s noticed\
  \ the fly rod. \nThe commonality opens a door in the wall between strangers. We\
  \ start laughing as they show me a trout they caught earlier, and I salivate as\
  \ they offer it to me, but the fish is too heavy to carry. \nI watch the wind blow\
  \ the dust away after they\u2019ve gone. The aloneness and exhaustion push down\
  \ on my chest. I\u2019ll be sleeping on the roadside tonight, a day behind schedule,\
  \ with food rations tight. I\u2019m behind a corner, so I\u2019m surprised by the\
  \ gray pickup as it bumps back towards me. The fisherman with the dark eyes smile\
  \ abashedly and says, \u201CWe came back for you.\u201D\nThe three of us fish until\
  \ the shadows grow tall. They show me their secret holes and riffles, and I hook\
  \ the biggest trout I\u2019ve ever caught. I tell them of my adventures, and they\
  \ tell me of their lives, and the vast reach of our differences blurs and disappears.\
  \ They marvel at a gringa hiking their reserves, but later, in confidence, the younger\
  \ one tells me he\u2019s always wanted to. When the sun leaves the sky that evening,\
  \ I\u2019m curled up in my tent on the reserve. The calamity and fatigue of the\
  \ morning are gone, replaced by a memory of unexpected kindness."
