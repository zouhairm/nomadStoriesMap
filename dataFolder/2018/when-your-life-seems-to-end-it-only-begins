Text: "Today is Valentine's Day and I'm going to find love 6213 miles away from home.\n\
  \nMy feelings are now a fabulous mix of childish joy and paralyzing fear.\n Almost\
  \ two months that I haven't seen him and everyday since, by his omnipresent, warm\
  \ and passionate texting, he made my dreams bigger. \n\"I can't wait to go through\
  \ Vietnam just you and me. I want to know everything about you and share everything\
  \ possible, maybe more\" His promise keeps resonating in my heart.\n\nWhen I arrive\
  \ in Laos, I want to embrace everything around me with open arms, feel the heat,\
  \ the dust, the noise. \nAfter few hours, I find Aur\xE9lien at a street corner,\
  \ my great adventurer who gave me the impetus to go so far on a whim.\n\nBut his\
  \ eyes are cold, his words are detached and mocking, his embrace distant. He immediately\
  \ takes me to meet his traveling companion. Who is none other than... his new girlfriend.\
  \ He doesn't plan to tell me. I will discover it by myself.\n\nAs a traveler, he\
  \ has only the taste of flight. Fly away from his own life. His travel program?\
  \ Leaving me here alone, fulfilling this dream with another girl. One passion: rework\
  \ his instagram photos and carefully choose the hashtags that will generate the\
  \ most thumbs in the air. \n\nWhen your dreams has become reality, for best or worst,\
  \ you can't go back anymore.\n\nMy bag weighs heavy.\n\nI call for help my friend\
  \ Bina who lives in Singapore.\n\"It is time for you to go on your own path. \n\
  Think about what prevents you from traveling alone. Write it down and go beyond.\
  \ I challenge you to accompany me to India in two days.Then you will have to continue\
  \ alone.\"\n\nA second later in my heart, I am already in Jaipur.\nI sleep on the\
  \ floor, freezing, gripping my bag with all my might, but gradually taking hold\
  \ of all my bearings. I hear sounds and I feel smells of another world that penetrates\
  \ me. The border between my dreams and reality has never been so thin. I'm letting\
  \ go years of mistrust. \n\nMy first real journey in Asia begins now.\n\nSix weeks\
  \ later, I crossed six countries, poured rivers of tears, made fabulous encounters.\
  \ Asia has stripped me of my bearings, and forced me to plunge deep into me, to\
  \ draw my greatest strength.\n\nThe last thing I expected was to find this kind\
  \ of deep love and confidence. I have never been so close to myself, yet devoid\
  \ of everything that made me who I thought I was. \n\nI gave myself a rose for Valentine's\
  \ Day, it is tattooed on my skin forever, pushing me forward, reminding me to offer\
  \ me the best."
