Text: "It was my first solo trip to Kashmir. Seeing solo woman traveller in Kashmir\
  \ intrigued the locals, especially the curious womenfolk. Why are you travelling\
  \ alone? Do you feel safe here? These are some of the questions that I had to constantly\
  \ give an answer to. And most of them had not travelled beyond the safe boundaries\
  \ of their village or city. But travelling alone outside their comfort zone was\
  \ something they all dreamed of. \n\nWhenever I travel, I always seek for two things,\
  \ one is local books and the other is music. On one such inquiry about it with the\
  \ local people, I heard about the new bookstore that had opened on the famous Dal\
  \ Lake in Srinagar. For me, that was the perfect setting for a bookstore. So, I\
  \ hopped onto a small boat and reached the bookstore. It was a store with a big\
  \ collection of local books and a small caf\xE9 overlooking the lake. I couldn\u2019\
  t have asked for more. As I immersed myself in books, I picked up a book by Rumi\
  \ and was reading its content when I heard a voice telling me that if I like Rumi\
  \ then I should read Forty Rules of Love. I turned around with a smile to see the\
  \ face of the voice only to be a greeted with a bigger smile by a young college\
  \ going girl who shared my love for Rumi. I told her that I was currently reading\
  \ it for the fourth time as it was one of my favourite books. She replied saying\
  \ that she had read it three times already. And there, in that bookstore blossomed\
  \ a friendship. We bought books and then sat in the cafeteria and over a cup of\
  \ kehwa discussed books, life in Kashmir and love for travel. She had never travelled\
  \ outside Kashmir, but she had no complaints.  She was content with her life there\
  \ and aspired to become an inspiring teacher. But there was one place she wanted\
  \ to go to, that was Konya, Turkey. We both knew why. I told her that it was on\
  \ my bucket list too and maybe we could go there together someday. It seemed like\
  \ a possible dream. The sun was setting over the lake and it was one of the most\
  \ beautiful sunsets I have seen in my life. We sat silently watching it, being hopeful\
  \ about our own dreams. As the skies were changing colour, she remembered that she\
  \ had to reach home before it became completely dark, rushing like Cinderella. We\
  \ hugged and promised to keep in touch. Just as she was leaving, she asked me my\
  \ name, we both laughed and realised that we had shared so much but had forgotten\
  \ to ask each other\u2019s name. Like they say, what\u2019s in a name, some connections\
  \ are more than that."
