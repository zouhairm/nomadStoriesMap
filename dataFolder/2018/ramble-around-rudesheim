Text: "The first time I traveled outside of the U.S. was the summer before my sophomore\
  \ year in high school. I was 15 years old when I traveled with a small group from\
  \ my German class, including my teacher, to spend 3 weeks in central Germany as\
  \ part of an exchange program. I loved every minute of it. I loved it so much that\
  \ I forgot to call home to let my parents know that I arrived safely. (Whoops!)\
  \ It has always been a dream of mine to return to Germany. Literally. I dream about\
  \ returning to Germany all the time. Now, 23 years later, I am a 38-year-old mother\
  \ to 2 teenagers, and am still in contact with my German exchange student, Dominique.\
  \ Early last year when my husband and I were discussing our summer trip ideas I\
  \ found affordable airfare that would take our family of 4 from the U.S. to Germany.\
  \ I messaged Dominique to see if he and his family would be available for a visit.\
  \ They were! The day we spent with them was the absolute highlight of our vacation.\
  \ We found Dominique and his delightful partner, Teresa, at the Niederwalddenkmal,\
  \ at the base of the Germania statue. After hugs and introductions they led us on\
  \ a trek through the Rhine River valley, downhill through the Riesling vineyards\
  \ to the picturesque little town of Rudesheim am Rhein. Halfway into our excursion\
  \ through the grapevines we came across a picnic table where we sat for a brief\
  \ rest. Dominique opened his backpack and pulled out a bottle of chilled Riesling,\
  \ plastic cups, and juice for the kiddos. Riesling is my favorite wine so this was\
  \ a treat, and oh so refreshing! During our break we chatted and told funny stories\
  \ while sipping our wine. We then we finished our hike into Rudesheim where we strolled\
  \ the cobbled streets, including the famous Drosselgasse, before taking the cable\
  \ car back to the top of the valley where our car was parked. Once in our rental\
  \ car we quickly followed Domi and Teresa back to his parent\u2019s home. (Germans\
  \ drive fast!) This is the same house where I stayed as a teen. Domi\u2019s mother,\
  \ Frau Neiss, prepared a feast for my family, meats from the grill, various salads,\
  \ and a fresh berry tart for dessert. I enjoyed being able to show my children the\
  \ beautiful home and garden I had told them about, not to mention how fun it was\
  \ to introduce them to the German family who I remember so fondly. If you\u2019\
  ve never been to the Rhine area of Germany, I highly recommend it. This is a truly\
  \ stunning area to explore, especially if you enjoy being outdoors as much as my\
  \ family does."
