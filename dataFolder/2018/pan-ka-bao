Text: "I keep petting the jungle dog in silence, until he shakes my hand and announces\
  \ himself as Pongphun. He speaks quietly, slow, and without much eye contact. His\
  \ english is pretty good and we begin talking about the farm, village, and the work\
  \ to be done. Pongphun seems like he's been a farmer for a while, he wears an old\
  \ button up shirt with holed up jeans, like a teenager would wear. He has only flip\
  \ flops on his dark feet, covered in years of dirt and sun. \n\nWe got ready for\
  \ a day in the field, putting on deodorant and clothes soon to be trashed, with\
  \ the sound of the voice still ringing in my ears. It was going to be a hot one,\
  \ but we had to wear pants to protect our legs from the sharp brush. I pulled a\
  \ buff over my face, and put my hat on. We went downstairs to brush our teeth. Pongphun\
  \ informed us that the sound came from the temple down the road, informing the villagers\
  \ a local Monk had passed away, so it was assumed today would be a gathering after\
  \ the days work.\n\n After breakfast, we collected Jackapples from the farm. Two\
  \ of us held up a tarp as Pongphun used a long stick to knock down the Jackapples\
  \ into the makeshift net, Within 30 minutes, we yielded some 15 pounds of apples,\
  \ which we cleaned and put in a basket. Later, we put on nice clothes, and all of\
  \ us walked to the temple together. We brought our gifts to share, and it seems\
  \ like the whole village was there.\n\n Kids skipped around chasing one another,\
  \ and adults made food and hung out with each other, like a big family. Some of\
  \ the younger villagers spoke simple English, so I hung out in a pavilion, chatting\
  \ up some local kids, laughing about our cultures and learning some new things too.\
  \ They were younger, and we laughed about and learned each others names. We stayed\
  \ and gathered in the temple to listen to Monks speak and read sutras for a while.\
  \ Pongphun introduced me to his friends and family, and translated for us. We stayed\
  \ up until almost 3am at the temple, when I left to go home and sleep.  Pongphun\
  \ stayed all night, because around noon the next day we stopped for lunch and he\
  \ fell asleep the rest of the day. When Pongphun took me to the bus stop our last\
  \ day together, we sat in his truck for a long time, talking. He didn't just share\
  \ his recipes and home with me, he shared with me his culture, heritage and his\
  \ livelihood. I watched him drive off onto the highway, knowing we may never cross\
  \ paths again, but the legacy he left was deeply embedded in the soil we tilled\
  \ in Pan Ba Kao."
