Text: "To avoid the touristic hordes, my local guide had intended to navigate us to\
  \ view the Koutoubia Minaret at smoggy dawn.  As with all good intentions however,\
  \ sometimes more important things take precedence.  For my travelling companions,\
  \ this took the form of a shopping expedition through Marrakesh\u2019s Djemaa el\
  \ Fna Square.  After a successful ransack of the souk, a chaotic maze of shops and\
  \ informal stands located within the medina walls, our travel group armed with their\
  \ loot of spices, colourful harem pants, scarves, medjoul dates and souvenir T-shirts,\
  \ finally allowed the guide to introduce us to his beloved mosque.\n\nThe Koutoubia\
  \ mosque is named after the manuscript sellers that used to peddle their wares outside\
  \ the walls. As only Muslims are allowed to enter the 12th century mosque, our party\
  \ was happy to stroll around the complex and view the pink stone Moroccan architecture.\
  \  Gazing at the looming minaret, I was amused to once again see the striking resemblances\
  \ to Moorish architecture found in the south of Spain.  \n\nMohamed, the guide,\
  \ tapped me on my shoulder and motioned for me to follow; and whilst the rest of\
  \ our party explored and photographed the gardens, the two of us hustled towards\
  \ the back gates of the garden.  Trying to pry the surprise out of Mohamed as we\
  \ dodged other pedestrians on the sidewalk proved impossible.  Mohamed stopped alongside\
  \ three men sitting against the garden fence.  An old man slowly stirred a pot on\
  \ a burner, and I was urged to take a seat with them.  After a rapid exchange of\
  \ Arabic and some dirham notes, a young man got up, and took out two ceramic bowls.\
  \  Whilst I watched intently, Mohamed said: \u201CYou wanted to taste bissara \u2013\
  \ this is the only way to do it.  The hotel is no good.\u201D The old man spooned\
  \ the rich soup made from broad beans, garlic and spices into the bowls.  He then\
  \ turned and picked up a canister to drizzle olive oil in spiral patterns.  The\
  \ bowls were finished off with a sprinkling of dry roasted cumin. \n\nSitting on\
  \ upturned crates covered in newspaper, tearing away pieces of flatbread, I swiped\
  \ up mouthfuls of this rustic, yet glorious soup.  In the background, the midday\
  \ Adhan - or call to prayer - started.  Dressed in my Indian punjabi \u2013 my most\
  \ conservative dress with its baggy pants and long tunic \u2013 and sitting amongst\
  \ four males in a conservative society, to the passers-by I must have stuck out\
  \ like a sore thumb.  But for me, this moment with my silent lunch companions was\
  \ truly authentic."
