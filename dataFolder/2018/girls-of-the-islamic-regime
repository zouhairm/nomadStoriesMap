Text: "I think I know something about young Iranian women until I realise Esta is\
  \ completely stoned. It\u2019s 8.00pm and we\u2019re about to cross the road \u2013\
  \ choked with traffic, tar lava-hot \u2013 in downtown Tehran. Esta\u2019s reddish,\
  \ half-moon eyes watch coolly the hot mess of metal between the venue and us. Horns\
  \ blare. Fumes swirl. Questions arise: Is Esta crazy? We weave Frogger-style through\
  \ angry vehicles, emerge unscathed and descend into the underground caf\xE9 where\
  \ a band will play. Here, Esta ain\u2019t alone. Herby smoke rolls overhead in the\
  \ dark space, where a sea of hip tehranis swells in black. I feel like pre-teen\
  \ Nikki Webster in my pink hijab. \u201CYou look fine. Pink is cool,\u201D Esta\
  \ assures me. The show starts: a local all-girl rock band who bang out Led Zeppelin\
  \ and Arctic Monkeys in leather boots and gothic tartan. Midway, footage is politely\
  \ banned. \u201CIt\u2019s illegal for girls to sing without a man in Iran,\u201D\
  \ Esta explains, stoking my inner-groupie. As decibels rise and the crowd head-bangs\
  \ on, Esta\u2019s friend hands me a bottle and gestures a swig. I wince as vodka\
  \ breathes fires into my belly. Where\u2019d she get this? I pass it to Esta and\
  \ ponder the likelihood of arrest in a country that issues lashes for boozing. No\
  \ one seems to care; all eyes are on-stage \u2013 except mine. I\u2019m suddenly\
  \ aware of the heady co-sex crowd and a couple canoodling nearby. The morality police\
  \ would mow through this place like kids in a koloocheh shop if someone tipped them\
  \ off. Post-gig, we surface into a civic jungle, where concrete slabs and brown-tinted\
  \ glass march skyward through neon haze \u2013 a 1980s urban aesthetic frozen in\
  \ time. Before heading home we farewell Esta\u2019s handsome friend, Ali. I\u2019\
  m keen to flirt but lack the cultural know-how; pre-marriage sex is forbidden, so\
  \ street-side tomfoolery seems downright wanton. Esta sighs as we depart. \u201C\
  God, he\u2019s gorgeous. And so good in bed.\u201D As we walk, Tehran growls around\
  \ us, throwing heat and smoke to the night. We dodge canyons in the pavement and\
  \ thick electric cables left sagging around like giant braids. \u201CSo, you have\
  \ a boyfriend?\u201D \u201CActually,\u201D Esta says, \u201Ca girlfriend.\u201D\
  \ Not that her parents know. Besides, homosexuality is illegal in Iran. \u201CWe\
  \ just keep it secret,\u201D she says. Back at my hostel, we share tea and stories\
  \ beneath courtyard lanterns. Outside, sirens whir. Cars screech. Finally, Esta\
  \ studies my hijab with those half-moon eyes. \u201CI never would have thought,\u201D\
  \ she says. \u201CThought what?\u201D A pause. \u201CThat Australian girls liked\
  \ pink so much.\u201D"
