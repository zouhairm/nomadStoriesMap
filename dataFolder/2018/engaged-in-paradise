Text: "Traveling has been a huge part of my life. I\u2019d like to share a couple\
  \ of amazing excursions everyone should go on while visiting Jamaica and share where\
  \ my husband popped the question. \n\nOur day started off bright and early in Montego\
  \ Bay. We took a nice air conditioned bus (AC is a must!) with a small group of\
  \ people down the coast of Jamaica to the Rio Grande River in Port Antonio, Jamaica.\
  \ It was a LONG ride, but our tour guide was so funny and entertaining. Plus we\
  \ stopped for snacks!\nWe arrived to the river where Jamaican men helped us onto\
  \ our own private raft in the water. It was such a peaceful and beautiful experience\
  \ floating down the Rio Grande. During the 40 minute Jamaican gondola ride my then\
  \ boyfriend surprised me by popping the question and I said YES!\n\nI\u2019ll never\
  \ forget that beautiful day. Our tour guides even recorded a majority of our day\
  \ and gave us a DVD, so we have footage of me cheesing like a dork because I had\
  \ just gotten engaged. Jamaica will always hold a special place in my heart. \n\n\
  Later that day we toured Dunn\u2019s River Falls. It was sooooo much fun! I recommend\
  \ getting there later in the day because it is less crowded so you won\u2019t have\
  \ to rush up the falls. We brought our swimsuits and water shoes and climbed climbed\
  \ climbed the gushing falls! It was quite the experience and our guide for that\
  \ was amazing and captured excellent photographs for us! Bring a towel + bring watershoes\
  \ + bring swimsuit and you\u2019ll have a blast!"
