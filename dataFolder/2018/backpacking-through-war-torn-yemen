Text: "The call to prayer sounds at eight, jolting me from my stupor. As the sun sets\
  \ over the Arabian skies, turning them fiery orange, it suddenly hits me: I am in\
  \ Yemen.  Specifically, its capital city, Sana\u2019a. \n\nI had spent the past\
  \ eight days locked in a make shift prison cell, held under suspicion of being a\
  \ spy. All my papers were in order. I had been granted permission to be the first\
  \ tourist in Yemen since the war. \n\nI spent three weeks gallivanting through this\
  \ wonderful nation before my arrest in Sana\u2019a. The country is a traveler\u2019\
  s paradise. \n\nAfter my plead of innocence was accepted by the Houthi officials,\
  \ I was given a fresh start.  A guide, whose name was Fuad, would show the real\
  \ Yemen. Before the war, he had led plenty of tours, These days the tourism trade\
  \ was finished, apart from this one last tourist. \n\nFrom Sana\u2019a, Fuad took\
  \ me high into the Haraz mountains. We visited small communities and incredible\
  \ historical sights. During the day, we hiked mountain paths. By night, we chewed\
  \ Khat in the dimly lit mud brick houses.\n\nUpon returning to Sana\u2019a, Fuad\
  \ introduced me to all his childhood friends, many of whom had studied in Canada,\
  \ in cities near to where I grew up. One evening, while of chewing Khat at Fuad\u2019\
  s house with friends, it all happened. The walls shook, and the air that was normally\
  \ filled with the sounds of Islamic prayer and music, rang with gunfire and explosions\
  \ of nearby fighting. \n\nIn the days to come I witnessed Yemen\u2019s war from\
  \ the balcony of my hotel. It was too dangerous for anyone to travel at these times.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t until the fighting came to my street that I learned of how deep\
  \ of a connection I had made with Fuad. With bullets ripping past him, and airstrikes\
  \ raining down from above, Fuad drove to my hotel and picked me up, he risked it\
  \ all. \n\nThe fighting lasted another four days before I could state my case to\
  \ the ICRC about getting out of Yemen. As all flights and transport where cancelled\
  \ in and out, hitching a ride with the ICRC was my only option. \n\nWhen the day\
  \ finally came to evacuate, Fuad was in tears, as was I. He had met me after my\
  \ interrogation, and we had explored this wonderful country. Fuad showed me the\
  \ real Yemen. But, it was finally time to say goodbye. \n\nFuad hugged me and said\
  \ one day we will meet again, God Wills It! I didn\u2019t realize until I was on\
  \ the flight and an ICRC worker told me that Fuad had followed our car all the way\
  \ to the airport. He truly risked it all, just to help a friend."
