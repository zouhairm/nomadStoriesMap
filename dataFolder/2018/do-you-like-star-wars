Text: "It was surprising to be in a Galway pub and have a complete stranger walk up\
  \ to me, gesture to his friend and say, \u201CThis is Joe, he likes Star Wars.\u201D\
  \nBefore I had time to work myself into a panic for not knowing how to respond to\
  \ that, the man continued, \u201CDo you like Star Wars?\u201D\nI practically had\
  \ to yell over the lively chatter and the sound of fiddles filling the pub. \u201C\
  I actually haven\u2019t seen Star Wars.\u201D\nI braced myself for the typical shock\
  \ and disappointment I got after uttering that statement. Instead, I got a smile\
  \ and a clap on the shoulder.\n\u201CDon\u2019t bother, it\u2019s shite!\u201D\n\
  Joe pipped up, \u201CThis is Mustard, he hates Star Wars.\u201D As an afterthought\
  \ he added, \u201CAnd he\u2019s getting married to a man!\u201D\n\u201CCongratulations!\u201D\
  \nMustard ducked his head and a fond smile passed over his face. \u201CGay marriage\
  \ is legal now in Ireland.\u201D\n\u201CI know! I was so happy to hear the news.\u201D\
  \ My heart warmed at the ease of the conversation. Having recently come out myself,\
  \ I was still in the process of racking up the courage to be more open when it came\
  \ to speaking of LGBT topics of any kind in public. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before\
  \ we wandered down the street to another pub and were, as the Irish say, having\
  \ the craic. \n\u201CWhere in Canada are you from?\u201D Mustard asked, once we\
  \ settled at a table with our drinks.\n\u201COttawa.\u201D\nJoe lifted his pint\
  \ up to his mouth, the cider sloshed slightly in the glass causing some to spill\
  \ out onto his shirt. He didn\u2019t seem to notice. \u201CI\u2019ve been to Sassasawan\
  \ before.\u201D\nI couldn\u2019t help but chuckle. \u201CYou\u2019ve been where\
  \ now?\u201D\n\u201CSassasawan.\u201D\n\u201CYou mean Saskatchewan?\u201D\nJoe nodded\
  \ emphatically, \u201CYeah, that\u2019s what I said! Sassasawan.\u201D\nThe corner\
  \ of my eyes crinkled up with laughter. \u201CNot quite, but points for effort I\
  \ suppose.\u201D\n\u201CFine. I bet you\u2019ll never be able to pronounce Mustard\u2019\
  s real name. It\u2019s got Irish spelling.\u201D Joe threw an arm around Mustard,\
  \ who in turn rolled his eyes.\n\u201CRight then. Give a girl a chance.\u201D\n\
  With a smirk, Mustard\u2019s name was spelled out for me. \u201CE-O-G-H-A-N.\u201D\
  \nA shot in the dark, \u201CEgan?\u201D\nJoe\u2019s smirk intensified. \u201CNot\
  \ even close!\u201D\n\u201CI have absolutely no idea.\u201D\n\u201COwen.\u201D\n\
  My eyes widened, \u201CSeriously? You\u2019re kidding!\u201D I looked over at Mustard\
  \ and he shook his head. \u201CWow. Alright.\u201D I held up my glass, \u201CHere\u2019\
  s to mispronouncing names.\u201D\nWith the clink of the glasses I knew that was\
  \ a night I would never forget."
