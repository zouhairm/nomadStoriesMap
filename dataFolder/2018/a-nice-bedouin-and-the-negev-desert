Text: "Every year, especially towards the end of winter and in summer, I feel a huge\
  \ need to leave my country to discover some new places, new cultures, which then,\
  \ in reality, translate into the discovery of a small part of myself. \nLast summer\
  \ I chose Israel. It was a long time that I had the desire to go to the desert,\
  \ to feel the sensation of being alone in front of the nothingness. Moreover, Israel\
  \ has always been a reality that I heard about but I had never been able to make\
  \ an idea of how it could really be. \nThe first day of August I arrived in Tel\
  \ Aviv with Achille, my backpack. I stayed there a few days before leaving for the\
  \ Dead Sea and Masada, an ancient fortress besieged by the Roman army during the\
  \ first Jewish War. Then I moved to Jerusalem and it was perhaps there that I began\
  \ to feel something new, different, inside me. It was Saturday morning, Shabbat\
  \ day, so I went to the Old City and while I was walking in the alleys towards the\
  \ Mecca, I met an elderly Bedouin,sitting outside of his small shop, who showed\
  \ me some stairs that led to a point where there was the possibility to see a beautiful\
  \ landscape. I followed the advice and then, going back, I stopped to thank him.\
  \ So he started asking me questions about my backgrounds and he told me some of\
  \ his story. At one point he asked me what was making me a little bit sad in that\
  \ period, he understood it from my eyes, my gaze. At that moment, I started to feel\
  \ so touched and I told him something briefly about it. He was very kind, he offered\
  \ me a cup of tea to relax and a few comforting words. What impressed me most was\
  \ this phrase: don't go against yourself if you are not ready but follow the wind\
  \ and let yourself be carried away. It has been very important for me, as if I felt\
  \ enveloped from a great energy and from a  great love for myself.\nA few days later\
  \ I left, with a different force, to the Negev Desert. I went by a bus full of young\
  \ guys in soldiers uniforms and after four hours I finally arrived at Mitzpe Ramon,\
  \ a small village in the middle of the desert. I walked to the hostel, which consisted\
  \ of three large tents, there was no electricity or connection for the phone, only\
  \ myself and four other fantastic people. I spent three wonderful days there, between\
  \ long walks, the view of the sunshine from the crater of Mitzpe Ramon, the books\
  \ and the listening to myself.\nIt was an unforgettable journey in which I felt\
  \ fear, silence and peace and on which there would be much more to tell about."
