Text: "The 3 C\u2019s of Life: Choices, Chances, Changes. You must make a CHOICE to\
  \ take a CHANCE or your life will never CHANGE. The greatest and most persistent\
  \ blockages to your progress in life usually come from a single source\u2014yourself.\
  \ My name is Hatini and i'm from Malaysia. Currently i live in italy. My life story\
  \ based of this 3 C's started 3 years ago. A decision that pushed me to the edge\
  \ when i have to choose between my career or love. I'm was in comfort zone as airhostess\
  \ for Qatar Airways. I'm pretty much enjoying my globerouter - this means you don't\
  \ get the \u201Clively\u201D experience you would at other times of the year. You\
  \ might missing some big event in your life such as a wedding, birthday or your\
  \ tipical cultural and religion celebration. Nonetheless, at the end of the day,\
  \ this job paid you well plus give you opportunity to exploring each city and get\
  \ closer to the locals around the world in the best 5 Stars hotel that you ever\
  \ could imagine of! All has CHANGED when i meet my husband, from a stranger that\
  \ i had meet in Prague, capital city of the Czech Republic, became my facebook friend,\
  \ then my husband at this moment. Of course every city around the one that i had\
  \ visited have their own unique beauty but still can't compare with the place that\
  \ where you leave your heart at. My CHOICE is to choose LOVE over my CAREER and\
  \ took a CHANCE to settel down with my husband in where he is original came from\
  \ -Porcia, Pordenone (an hour from Venice, in the north of Italy). Here i am, my\
  \ life totally CHANGED! The weather,  languages, cultural, foods, enviroment etc.\
  \ I have to started everything from zero but it's all worthy! Some of my friend\
  \ was thinking that i'm crazy to make this CHOICE of my life but it's doesn't matters.\
  \ Not many people have a guts to come out from their comfort zone. Somehow i did\
  \ it! And it's the best thing that i ever did, to CHANGED my entire life! Afterall\
  \ you only live once. Now our marriaged still growth strong each days. I never regret\
  \ of my CHOICE because as people always said, \"Between Career and Love, you hardly\
  \ get it both unless you are so damn lucky!\". In my story, i'm not that damn lucky\
  \ to have it both yet i'm lucky to had my love that always be my strong backbones\
  \ to supporting me. Because of him also i'm try to create my own career with handmade\
  \ stuff from home. Afterall, is not easy to get a job that you passionate about\
  \ in one of country side of europe. I'm still hoping to be that damn lucky one with\
  \ 3 Cs in my life!"
