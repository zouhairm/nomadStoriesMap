Text: "I waited for Rocco outside a caf\xE9 with no name on the Rue Tournebride across\
  \ from the church Sainte Cecile. I beat him there despite being twenty minutes late,\
  \ but he assured me that if I followed the marzipan scent it would guide me there\
  \ like the tantalizing coil of a beckoning cartoon finger. \"Like Looney Tunes,\"\
  \ he championed over the phone. It was late August and the streets were sticky and\
  \ still. It's the kind of sweating heat that turns a model's collar bone basin into\
  \ a bird bath, yet people still drank coffee. In the church courtyard, I watched\
  \ three Italian women in matching jean jackets ameliorate themselves from the heat\
  \ by splashing holy water from a gurgling fountain on their tan necks. They filled\
  \ their plastic bottles and one even took a sip as they walked out. \nRocco is the\
  \ ex-pat friend of my most traveled ex. She described him as a refugee from a Fellini\
  \ film. We had only briefly spoken over the phone when he announced how he detested\
  \ a faceless voice and asked me to meet him here. Rocco appeared like a mirage through\
  \ an undulating heat. The waiter walked up as soon as he sat down and Rocco ordered\
  \ two Aperol Spritzes.\nSmall, balding, and beady-eyed with a bolo tie, Rocco could've\
  \ been any character from a Fellini film. He dressed like a dashing lothario, looked\
  \ like the leader of a communist think tank, and smelled like the ripe end of a\
  \ wine cork. The waiter returned with our drinks and a plate of petit-fours. Rocco\
  \ thanked him and the waiter referred to him by name. Rocco crossed his leg, leaned\
  \ forward with a smile. There were tiny gaps between his teeth.\n\"Go on. Try. Tell\
  \ me that's not the greatest marzipan you've ever had.\"\nI did and I agreed, mostly\
  \ because I didn't have a wide reference base.\n\"The only one better might be in\
  \ Toledo. Adolfo's. You must go. In France, this is the best. Adolfo. That name.\
  \ People don't call it in America, no?\"\n\"One guy spoiled it for the rest.\"\n\
  \"Like you say, one bad apple. Estelle told me you travel for food.\"\n\"Yes\u2026\
  \"\nAs I said this a pigeon landed on the table. I lifted my arm to swat at it,\
  \ but the pigeon remained motionless. I caught Rocco's eye. He looked at me as if\
  \ whatever I was to do next would be a teachable moment. I lowered my arm slowly.\
  \ The pigeon began to peck at the petit-fours.\n\"He traveled for food too,\" he\
  \ said before placing the plate on the ground."
