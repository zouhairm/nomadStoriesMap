Text: "Just like the seven wonders of the world, Utah carries many wonders of it's\
  \ own. The state is divided into two parts; north and south. Southern Utah contains\
  \ the majestic Arches National Park,  beautiful Bryce Canyon, and the infamous green\
  \ jell-o. The north contains Temple Square, Bear Lake, the Bonneville Salt Flats,\
  \ and strangely enough, also green jell-o. \n\nThe Bonneville salt flats are both\
  \ alluringly beautiful and strange. It's a dystopian land that is straight out of\
  \ a science fiction thriller. Unfortunately, we weren't chased by rogue robots,\
  \ daleks, or zombies. I'm as disappointed as you are. There's a large area that\
  \ has been named the Bonneville speedway. In talking with my brother, we decided\
  \ to take a little day trip. There's nothing like a four hour road trip to drive\
  \ on a white desolate plain of salt at 110 mph (if you didn't roll your eyes, I\
  \ can wait). I was expecting a breathtaking landscape that you only see once in\
  \ a lifetime. A place that would make my friends envious and my stories exciting.\
  \ My traveling track record was against me and our time was running short. \n\n\
  Let me paint you a picture. It's 4:00 in the morning. You can see your breath scatter\
  \ in the morning air. Today's the day, the day you get to see one of the most photographed\
  \ spots in the state of Utah. You're so excited that you forget to eat. All you\
  \ can think about is getting there before sunrise. You sit in the pitch black car\
  \ for what seems like an eternity. You're stomach starts to eat itself. An alien\
  \ pops out of your chest and kills your brother, the car swerves into on coming\
  \ traffic. You're screaming and the last thing you see is the gnashing teeth of\
  \ an extra terrestrial being and beams of light from the cars headed right at you...Paying\
  \ attention now? Good. \n\nWith any adventure my brother and I manage to go on,\
  \ it always falls a little short. This one was of average height. We pulled up to\
  \ the speedway just in time to witness one of the most beautiful sunrises I have\
  \ ever witnessed. The salt was a dull blue that made it look like an oceanic ice\
  \ field. The rising sun cast a magnificent orange across the sky and reflected off\
  \ the pools of water scattered across the salt. They acted as perfect mirrors, reflecting\
  \ the sky and magnifying the beauty around us. Although it wasn't a place I could\
  \ see myself spending a lot of time and certainly wasn't the exciting adventure\
  \ I thought it would be, the sunrise and laughter was worth every minute."
