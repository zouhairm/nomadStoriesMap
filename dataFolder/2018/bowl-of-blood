Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t tell them you\u2019re American. They might think you\u2019\
  re here to kill them.\u201D\n\nI look at Pheng, my Mekong Smile Cruise guide, in\
  \ disbelief. The war ended 40 years ago. How could anyone think--\n\n\u201CAnd stay\
  \ on the trail. There are millions of unexploded ordnances in Laos. The U.S. dropped\
  \ a planeload every 8 minutes for 9 years. Over 80 million failed to detonate.\u201D\
  \n\nOh. \n\nWater buffalo graze along the mighty Mekong as Pheng provides more context.\
  \ These remote tribes now know the danger, he explains, but many are so poor that\
  \ they can\u2019t resist trying to recover bombs. They can sell the scrap metal\
  \ (it\u2019s worth $2-200, depending on size) or use it build guns and knives for\
  \ hunting. \n\nAelan, our chef, heads to the bow of the slow boat, a 60-foot vessel\
  \ adorned with blankets and used car seats. She ducks as she passes us, bending\
  \ almost in half to keep her head below mine, then helps the captain pull the unwieldy\
  \ watercraft ashore. \n\nSix fellow travelers and I follow Pheng past chickens and\
  \ homes made of bamboo and metal scraps. Yet, somehow, each windowless home has\
  \ a rusty satellite on the outside. Turning a corner, we see about 30 villagers\
  \ gathered around small tables.\n\n\u201CA wedding!\u201D Pheng exclaims.\n\nTheir\
  \ faded clothes look worn and prosaic, not festive. But\u2026 a fresh carcass hangs\
  \ from a tree branch. Meat is a luxury in these villages.\n\nAs I survey the scene,\
  \ the men at a small table motion me to join them. One pulls out a chair; I\u2019\
  m not one to say no. They cheer as I sit, and I smile widely.\n\n\u201CMy\u2026\
  \ Granddaughter,\u201D one man enunciates, pointing to the bride.\n\n\u201CWow!\u201D\
  \ I exclaim. \u201CCongratulations!\u201D\n\nAnother round of cheers and charades\u2013\
  and the grandpa passes me a bowl of blood. \u201CEat!\u201D he urges. \n\nMy inner\
  \ dialogue erupts. I\u2019m the kind of person who says yes\u2013just ask the crunchy\
  \ bugs I ate for dinner last night. But\u2026 this isn\u2019t crickets or mystery\
  \ dessert.\n\nIt\u2019s blood. \n\nI scan my memory\u2013what vaccines did I get\
  \ before this trip? What diseases come from drinking blood? Would my travel insurance\
  \ cover this?\n\nThis is one decision I can\u2019t go back from, I realize. Dropping\
  \ my head in a low bow, I return the bowl. \u201CI wish I could.\u201D Pheng motions\
  \ for me to rejoin him, so the grandfather shakes my hand. I thank him again, then\
  \ turn\u2013\n\nSmack! Right into the raw meat carcass. \n\nI smile one last time\
  \ at the men (\u201CI\u2019m okay!\u201D), then look down at the blood that\u2019\
  s now glistening on my shoulder and staining my shirt.\n\nOh well, I think. Better\
  \ on me than in me, right?"
