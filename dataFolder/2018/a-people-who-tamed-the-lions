Text: "The lion charged toward us, as angry as an irritated eel, and while my heart\
  \ beat so hard against its cage, the Maasai men didn't look unmoved. They didn't\
  \ have a choice, for standing strong and protecting the cattle would qualify you\
  \ for the rank of the bravest, or better yet they would join the elite warriors\
  \ of the community called The Moran. Like passing seconds, lion was less than a\
  \ metere away from us. and like the rest, my right leg, bent, rested on my left\
  \ leg, just above the knees. I knew deep down that if I had to survive this- I had\
  \ to do as I had been instructed to and so as I trembled with fear, I used a spear\
  \ to support myself. The few minutes before the lion walked away, seemed to me like\
  \ ages. I have never been so thrilled in my life, to think that the Maasai people\
  \ do this almost everyday. \nI don't regret leaving the city, with its intimidating\
  \ skyscrapers that tower above you, crowded streets that i call the labyrinths with\
  \ the robot people who walk on them, I don't regret leaving to come and to get lost\
  \ in the heart of this virgin jungle. Maasai Mara is a magical place, I was fed\
  \ up with reading about it in history books and watching documentaries about it\
  \ on national geographic, I wanted to get the experience by myself. \nI'm leaving\
  \ my Manyatta to head for the hills, my guide- the owner of the residence, Mr Mpeti\
  \ himself, is taking me to meet the Maasai people and to experience their culture\
  \ first hand, we are taking the cattle out to graze in the plains. The feel of golden\
  \ rays of the morning sun smooch my skin is uncomparable, a gourd of millet porridge\
  \ in my hand. A manyatta is the name the locals have christened their cottages,\
  \ built from mud, sticks and cow dung. This is the beauty of camping at Mpeti's\
  \ Camp. Forget El Dorado, this land is a combination of all the wonders of the world,\
  \ of the skies and of the universe.\nMpeti's residence is situated in the heart\
  \ of Maasai Mara, 300 kilometers from Kenya's capital city, Nairobi. People visit\
  \ Maasai Mara for various reasons, it is here that the wildebeest migrate, cross\
  \ Mara river, fight hungry and agile crocodiles to get into Serengeti, in search\
  \ of food and survival. It is a sight priceless. It is home to the Maasai people,\
  \ a Nilotic community living in this southern part of Kenya, famous for their love\
  \ of cattle keeping, hunting skills and bravery. For generations they have mastered\
  \ the skill of taming lions just long enough for them to keep their animals and\
  \ themselves safe."
