Text: "Dust specks flitted in shafts of light as I looked at the space I had just\
  \ entered. It was the courtyard of a dargah (mausoleum). Serene and unassuming,\
  \ it had a musty smell that belonged to historical sites. I turned to find an elderly\
  \ man- the caretaker- looking at me expectantly. Wordlessly, he led me to a tomb.\
  \ Marble-white and unmarked, the tomb lay comfortable in the silence, soon broken\
  \ by the caretaker\u2019s words: \u201CHere lies the emperor Aurangzeb.\u201D\n\n\
  Aurangzeb, the last notable Mughal emperor of the Indian subcontinent, was the son\
  \ of Shah Jahan and Mumtaz Mahal, whose love story inspired India\u2019s most famous\
  \ monument. It was his ambition that, school books taught us, made him murder his\
  \ brothers and imprison his father for his claim to the throne. He named his empire\u2019\
  s new capital after him- Aurangabad, a town in central India which now draws tourists\
  \ for its ancient Buddhist caves. It was here that I had travelled for a weekend.\n\
  \nIt was after my excursion at the Ellora caves that my taxi driver/self-appointed\
  \ tour guide suggested a visit to Khuldabad, just 3 km away. He delighted in the\
  \ information, as he said in Marathi-infused Hindi, \u201CWith you visiting Bibi\
  \ ka Maqbara tomorrow, it is fitting to see the emperor, no?\u201D Bibi ka Maqbara,\
  \ or the mini-Taj Mahal, is the mausoleum of Aurangzeb\u2019s wife, built in Aurangabad\
  \ by their son in 1660. My interest was piqued: I had heard from locals that the\
  \ small town was where Aurangzeb had been buried in 1707 in the dargah of his spiritual\
  \ teacher, Zainuddin. The taxi drove noisily on the gravel road, stealing glances\
  \ from the townsfolk; tourists clearly weren\u2019t common here.\n\nI found the\
  \ dargah easily enough: it was just off the town road. Twenty-something stairs led\
  \ up to it with paan-chewing locals sitting on the far ends, a beckoning that felt\
  \ like a rite of passage. This was why finding the tomb felt anticlimactic. \u201C\
  Aurangzeb requested this as his dying wish,\u201D informed the caretaker with a\
  \ smile, \u201CWhat need did his body have for monuments? He spent money on his\
  \ people, not himself. He was fierce, yes, but simple that way.\u201D The differences\
  \ between Aurangzeb and Shah Jahan now seemed tilted; my image of a moustache-curling\
  \ megalomaniac in the lovelorn tale of an exiled king didn\u2019t fit. The revelation\
  \ opened a barrage of questions at my newfound guide. With a tilt of his head, the\
  \ caretaker motioned to explore the rest of the town and its mosques. I gratefully\
  \ followed, on an unexpected afternoon of unlearning."
