Text: "For the first time in my life, I was comfortable in that darkness. As I lay\
  \ my back on the broken terrace of Munsabhanj Village School, all I could see were\
  \ those Constellations jutting clearly, unlike seen in my  own faraway city. Lately,\
  \ dwelling on the precipice of failure, quelling anxieties of mid-life crisis, I\
  \ found comfort in the brokenness of things. \n\nIn the tiniest village stood my\
  \ friend\u2019s dream, a school for tribal children - his vow to make a difference.\
  \ While I heard the elephants marching towards the lake, far at distance and insects\
  \ scurrying around me in darkness, my encounter with little Sayu wafted through\
  \ my mind.\n\n\u2018Why didn\u2019t you come to the school Sayu? My friend asked\
  \ this little boy who jostled his dusty, bare shoulders through the bushes. \n\n\
  \u2018It was my turn to sleep.\u2019 Surely a futile reason.\n\n\u2018That isn\u2019\
  t futile,\u2019 my friend said on our way back from the forest.  \u2018Every member\
  \ of the family takes turn to eat puffed rice soaked in water which makes them sleep\
  \ for longer hours. If one out of four is asleep, then they only have to worry for\
  \ three stomachs.'\n\nMy heart sank as if drowned in deep dry well. My gut shuddered\
  \ the realities of life right on my face. Miles away from my home I never imagined,\
  \ the skin of the earth was so parched by emptiness of humans, yet those uncomplaining\
  \ eyes stood out to me like a shrine. \n\n\u2018But why must they bare so many children\
  \ then?\u2019 I asked my friend, who kept collecting twigs bundling them under his\
  \ arms.\n\n\u2018Sayu isn\u2019t their son. His parents committed suicide. Some\
  \ prefer death over hunger. Many are left alone but the community adopts them willingly.\u2019\
  \n\nThere, inside my fretting mind was no space left to ask anything further. I\
  \ felt I was on the last chapter, last page and the final full stop of my story.\
  \ Suddenly, all my worries disappeared. My fragile heart woke to vulnerability,\
  \ which surprisingly made me feel alive. I realised our hearts find more comfort\
  \ in the unknown.  I removed my sandals and walked barefoot. The sole burned, the\
  \ thorns pricked, but that blood gushed life inside me.\n\nI helped my friend collect\
  \ more twigs that we weaved together throughout the day and under which I rested\
  \ my mid-life spine, starring at the pole star that just stays. In its stillness\
  \ is the existence of directions. \n\nI didn\u2019t know that this untraceable village,\
  \ in the middle of nowhere, will trace my inner compass and bring me back to my\
  \ centre. \n\nI later learned Sayu means goddess of love and fertility."
