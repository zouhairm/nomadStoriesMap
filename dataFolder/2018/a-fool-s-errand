Text: "Koh Phi Phi Don is one of the two Phi Phi Islands located in the south of Thailand.\
  \ It\u2019s small, and seems to contain infrastructure more-or-less exclusively\
  \ for tourism. From a bird\u2019s eye view, the island is shaped sort of like an\
  \ imperfect butterfly; cliffs and hills make up the top and bottom of the land,\
  \ and in the middle is a thin strip of earth flanked on both sides by crescent shaped\
  \ shores. If you climb up to one of the natural viewpoints, the scenes that greet\
  \ you will feel like nothing less than lost fragments of paradise. But all of this\
  \ beauty would stand as a nonsensical backdrop for the purpose of my visit there:\
  \ a drunken kickboxing fight.\n\nThere\u2019s a bar on Koh Phi Phi Don called \u2018\
  the Reggae Bar\u2019. As far as I could tell, it had very little connection to reggae.\
  \ The interior looks more like a gym than a bar, but with tables and chairs instead\
  \ of mats and punching bags. And as advertised, it has a full-sized, authentic kickboxing\
  \ ring occupying the main corner of the room. Patrons sit around the ring and drink\
  \ while two human sacrifices fight for their life as a show for the rest, the only\
  \ prizes being some drunken glory and a bucket of free alcohol. But when the bar\
  \ staff began to ask who wanted to be the next one to fight, my hand shot up right\
  \ away.\n\nI didn\u2019t have any real Muay Thai experience. That was part of the\
  \ fun. Anyone can choose to hop in the ring at the Reggae Bar and fight a complete\
  \ stranger. Anyone including a clueless, unfit student with a body type that might\
  \ be classified as \u2018that which resembles a stick insect\u2019. But this was\
  \ my way of engaging with local culture, and you really can\u2019t convince a fool\
  \ otherwise once his mind is made up. Soon, I was dressed up in kickboxing gear,\
  \ standing opposite a much heavier looking opponent, as fifty or so merciless pairs\
  \ of eyes watched us from the outside of the ring.\n\nThere isn\u2019t much to say\
  \ here. I threw some fists, and more fists were thrown back at me, much harder.\
  \ Despite my rival being a bit shorter than me, he still somehow managed to land\
  \ a kick directly into my skull, too. In this way, three rounds passed in a blur,\
  \ and my opponent was declared the winner. \n\nSoon after, I would share my complimentary\
  \ bucket of (medicinal) alcohol with some Thai locals on the beach. They took me\
  \ to sit and drink near one of the outdoor clubs, where they just watched foreign\
  \ tourists dance. It hadn\u2019t before occurred to me that sometimes when you go\
  \ to look at another culture, it looks at you back."
