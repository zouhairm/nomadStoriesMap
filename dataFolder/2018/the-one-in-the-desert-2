Text: "As I sat down on the decrepit sandstone brick beneath the welcoming shade of\
  \ the stone and palm wood ramshackle, that lay on the southeast corner of the Mandisha\
  \ village of the Bahariya Oasis, I felt a wave of perspiration rush from my forehead\
  \ down to the tail of my back. the small hut that only stood a few feet above me\
  \ was written with words of age and stories unknown to everyone but those that once\
  \ stood inside her doorstep and fed in her living spaces. cracks crept from wall\
  \ to the wood that stuck out from the corners that emulated a vined lattice.  scars\
  \ left their mark after sand and wind slowly whispered their way around the structure.\
  \ its windows without light. to me, the hut was lifeless and seemingly abandoned.\
  \  I sit back to feel another haul of sweat trickle its way around my dehydrating\
  \ body, ready for a few more minutes to relax beneath the shade of the perished\
  \ house before continuing on with the heavy weight of the sun, when I heard the\
  \ scrape of a leather heal step through the door. I see her.\n\n     curious, I\
  \ watch an elderly, tan skinned woman that had in-fact inhabited the shack. as my\
  \ pupils follow the slow steps of her thin brown legs towards the same brick I was\
  \ sitting on, her eyes were fixated on me as well. she roamed closer still watching\
  \ me until she sat on the same stone. she lost interest in me as she settled, gazing\
  \ off into the dusty village before our feet, bliss was riddled in the wrinkles\
  \ of her face as her mind wandered along the same paths the villagers walked. \n\
  \n\"do you live here? \" I ask.\nshe turned her slender head with lips closed and\
  \ easy eyes, instantly I know she doesn't speak English as she knew I didn't speak\
  \ a word of Arabic. she gently looked me over and went back to the streets of Mandisha.\
  \ absorbed to the natural beauty of this woman, I analyze her weathered face; with\
  \ a new word for every line on her leathery skin, with her ceremonial piercing \
  \ in the skin of her nostril, and the facial tattoos that spoke their own story.\
  \ I look back into her hazel eyes and see a kind spirit, un-withered by the life\
  \ that surrounded her.  I see shade those in the desert seek refuge in and the seemingly\
  \ derelict home, resilient from the years of time, with endless thoughts surrounding\
  \ the insides of her walls. she was the one in the desert. who was she? she was\
  \ beautiful \n \nas we sit wordless on the stone, I feel the cooling shade. finally,\
  \ the hut takes me into her arms. oasis"
