Text: In October 2015, my best friend Beto broke his relationship and call me to go
  to Miami to visit his friend Guga that used to live in his neighbourhood on childhood.
  Then at the same time, walking and talking I found the cheapest tickets in an app.
  So I bought and he also did it. But then he realized that he hadn't have his passport
  and visa updated to travell to US. Then he started a journey to get this before
  the day of the trip. Unfortunaly, he didn't get the visa and I had to travel alone
  to stay with his friend's house that I've met at the time when I knocked the door.
  Guga, was, at the time, marriaged and he and his wife were very friendly, but I
  had to go in a Halloween party that I've bought the ticket with Beto. Then I went
  alone, and there were me in the dark, when a real lighting angel apeared and started
  to talk with me. The funny here is that I was in a fantasy of devil and she was
  like an angel and we started to talk. And we still talk since that every week, also
  we make some bussiness together and talk about life. It was a real good experience
  of local connection and how life happen sometime in an unexpected way.
