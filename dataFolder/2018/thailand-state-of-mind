Text: "I sat facing the ocean as day became night. The sand was damp from the brief\
  \ interlude of fat, warm rain that characterizes the rainy season in Thailand and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but feel a heightened sense of wonder at the world. Wisps\
  \ of hair kissed lightly at my face as the heavy evening air rolled in from the\
  \ ocean but I was surprisingly unbothered by the wind tickling my nose, the passing\
  \ rain and the sound of tuktuks honking in the background. In only two months, I\
  \ had come to find an inner peace that I truly did not know was there. I did yoga\
  \ everyday and meditated occasionally, but often felt blocked and unable to fully\
  \ relax my mind and focus my intention. Somehow, in allowing the spirituality that\
  \ permeated the country and its people to enter my own soul, I was able to access\
  \ the inner peace I had so often attempted to attain. I let go of my inhibitions\
  \ and let the spirits enter my heart;  I completely let my guard down and unabashedly\
  \ let the song \u201Com\u201D escape my lips; I sat and focused on my breath and\
  \ my mantra while the rest of the world fell away. \n\nEvery morning, offerings\
  \ of fresh fruit, candied treats and incense were set out in front of homes and\
  \ businesses- gifts presented to the spirits of ancestors so that they may watch\
  \ over the home. The Thai people believe in these spirits and their power; believe\
  \ in the protection and the guidance they represent. Coming from western culture,\
  \ this practice was entirely foreign to me but the more time I spent there the more\
  \ the richness of the country\u2019s beliefs settled into my heart and mind. In\
  \ time, I could feel the spirits all around me, could sense their presence in the\
  \ night air blowing into my room, sense them watching over me as I walked alone\
  \ in a country where I constantly felt overexposed and vulnerable.\n\nIn meditating\
  \ that night on the beach, the complete weightlessness and peace that came over\
  \ me was unlike anything I\u2019d ever hoped to experience. There is a vibe that\
  \ pulses through the country, sets the tone for how life unfolds there. The beauty\
  \ of Thailand is that she offers you the chance to free your mind, body and spirit\
  \ of all negativity; to focus on the interconnectivity each of us shares with the\
  \ world. When I allowed that transformative lesson to enter my heart, the minor\
  \ troubles of day-to-day life had less of a hold on me. In moments when I would\
  \ have otherwise been overwhelmed, I allowed the zen life-beat of Thailand to take\
  \ over my spirit and guide me to true contentment- to peace."
