Text: "A thunderstorm rolled slowly over the basin, unloading thousands of gallons\
  \ of water onto the land. X-rays of lightening illuminated the canopy and I itched\
  \ a mosquito bite on my thigh. I was working as a translator in an eco-lodge learning\
  \ about their histories as indigenous stewards; how colonial contact changed their\
  \ river, how layers of migration formed their identities, how globalization is shaping\
  \ their futures. As I left the Amazon before the rains came I noticed my mosquito\
  \ bite had changed. I had a hole in my leg, but a friend was visiting and nothing\
  \ was going to ruin our adventure. So I ignored it. I carried the strange mark across\
  \ the iridescent Andes and when the itch became a wriggling I knew I bore the mark\
  \ of a parasite intent on building her home in my thigh. Her. I was to have a girl,\
  \ I just knew it. Beneath the fear of being parasitized, a maternal instinct blossomed\
  \ in my consciousness. Passivity became nurturance. I named her Diana. A parasite\
  \ with a hole through my leg was something to worry about. Diana was a blessing,\
  \ a frontier of trans-species motherhood. But I was grappling with a decision I\
  \ never saw coming, especially as a man. Should I abort Diana or carry her to full\
  \ term? Our trip continued with a visit to a community where I\u2019d volunteered\
  \ years back. I felt at home after months on the road and decided to break the news\
  \ that I was expecting! People of the highlands have all sorts of stories about\
  \ life in the Amazon but Diana was a new chapter in their savage narrative of life\
  \ in the jungle. They insisted I was doomed and that Diana was leaving my body at\
  \ night to infect others. She had to go. Some overdue research revealed she was\
  \ a bot fly with a 3 month gestation. It\u2019s tricky removing larvae in the third\
  \ trimester. Larvae. Diana wasn\u2019t so cute anymore. She had opposing hooks that\
  \ secured her deep in my skin preventing removal by force. Driven by fear, I covered\
  \ the hole in salve. She was cut off from oxygen and retracted her hooks. Before\
  \ long I saw movement near the surface. She was coming out! My excitement sent shock\
  \ waves through our womb and she withdrew into her safe space. I paced, hoping to\
  \ feel the familiar twinge, that \u2018being eaten alive slowly\u2019 feeling I\
  \ had come to love. But there was nothing. She recoiled, suffocated and died. In\
  \ another reality, I endured a few more weeks of growing pains. Diana removed her\
  \ hooks and burst through her parasitic birth canal. She transformed into a fly\
  \ and began the cycle anew."
