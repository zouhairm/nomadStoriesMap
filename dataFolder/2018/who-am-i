Text: "I want nothing; save for the warmth brought by a bed, shower, food, or embrace.\
  \ The few words I've learned while wandering, are the only things that assist me\
  \ in these efforts. In lands where the common tongue changes upon the color of the\
  \ soil; I set footprints that no tourist sees.\nClimbing aboard retired vehicles,\
  \ stewing in smells cattle would steer from. Eating at restaurants without kitchens.\
  \ Browsing supermarkets that slither and screech. Shopping in plazas where wares\
  \ are shouted. Strolling through alleyways where children con for coin. I take time\
  \ to tend to my feral pets, so tentatively affectionate.\n\nOver treacherous rock,\
  \ and forbidden fields, I climb. The path's I take, carry more hoofs than feet.\
  \ The sights I behold, no foreign soul has ever seen.\n\nI cheer with businessmen\
  \ and beggars for sports I've never played; I dance with felons; shake hands with\
  \ the homeless; sleep in bed-less beds; share smiles with faces that have no teeth;\
  \ and break bread with those who have no water. Show me the wilds of this world,\
  \ for I am\na Nomad.\n\nIn October, of 2015, I began a gap year. Little did I know,\
  \ one flight would start a world venture including every continent. During the first\
  \ few months in my journey, I found myself sitting in hostels across Europe, listening\
  \ to different people with the same story. They told me tales of pristine beaches,\
  \ snow capped mountains, and endless deserts. They described cultures and people\
  \ that were vastly different than anything I had encountered thus far. It didn't\
  \ take me long to buy a ticket to Morocco. In March, of 2016, my life changed again.\
  \ I found myself in situations most people could only conceptualize in daydreams\
  \ and nightmares. It completely changed the way I traveled. I grew comfortable around\
  \ people who were nothing like me. I developed a saying: people are people. Cultures\
  \ may change, but people remain the same, everywhere. While in Northern Africa,\
  \ I hitchhiked, nearly got robbed, battled elements on opposite ends of a thermometer,\
  \ made lifelong friends, and grew to understand what it meant to be a nomad. In\
  \ a place that has a nomadic culture from before the Roman empire I found the lands\
  \ calling me. I learned to cram my belongings into a single bag, survive by the\
  \ helpfulness of others, and dwell with people most others would cast aside. I\u2019\
  ve turned these moments into stories, and at the end of my adventure, these stories\
  \ will fill the bindings of a book.\n\nThe Short Tales of a Long Trip\nBy Michael\
  \ Aneson"
