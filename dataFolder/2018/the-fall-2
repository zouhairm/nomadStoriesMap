Text: "And then the worst happened. I lost my footing and an epic battle with gravity\
  \ began.  Grasping wildly at thin branches, my body hit the ground hard. Flashes\
  \ of leaves and bright sky, wind in my ears, I dug my hands into the earth, but\
  \ I continued to slide through the mud. How was I going to explain plummeting to\
  \ my death to my mother?  I\u2019m sure she wouldn\u2019t hold back an \u201CI told\
  \ you so\u201D, even at my funeral. Three months ago, I made a decision that pushed\
  \ me to the edge\u2026the literal edge of a mountain in Sapa, Vietnam. \n\nI quit\
  \ my job, stuffed a backpack to the brim and embarked on a \u201CTurning Thirty\
  \ and Terrified Trip\u201D through Southeast Asia, alone. Like many backpackers,\
  \ my eyes salivated at stunning pictures of burgeoning rice fields stretching for\
  \ miles in front of imposing mountains under a mist filled sky. I wanted in.\n\n\
  I booked a Sapa trek and overnight homestay with a local family through my hostel.\
  \ Transportation from and back to Hanoi, prepared meals and a guide for the two-day\
  \ 12 mile trek was all included in the too-good-to-be-true American dollar price.\
  \ \n\nThe moment I arrived, a cool fresh breeze wrapped its arms around my body;\
  \ welcoming me to the most enthralling place I\u2019d ever seen. The bright greens\
  \ and yellows of the terraced rice paddies were striking against a backdrop of rolling\
  \ hills and mountains peaking through stretches of clouds. \n\nWomen and little\
  \ girls of the Hmong tribe dressed in traditional clothing full of rich colors joined\
  \ our group as we began our trek. A young woman named Si, introduced herself and\
  \ became my walking buddy. Newly married and a newer mom, her one-month old baby\
  \ secured to her back, Si says, \u201CDon\u2019t worry, I help you.\u201D \n\nWhen\
  \ I wanted to quit, I looked over at Si. She hopped from rock to rock as if her\
  \ plastic sandals were suction cups. With the balance of a two-year old, I struggled.\
  \ The hills were steep with paths so tiny at points that only one person could pass\
  \ at a time. With the ground slippery from a recent rain and the sun merciless,\
  \ a thought entered my mind that crippled my aching body, \u201CDon\u2019t fall!\u201D\
  \ \n\nAnd yet it happened. I fell. I looked up at a seemingly endless sky \u2013\
  \ a sky I\u2019d never seen before back in Washington, DC \u2013 and wanted to cry.\
  \ I wanted to cry because I fell. I fell and I was turning thirty with no idea what\
  \ was next. I thought I would cry. Instead, I smiled. Rising to my feet, I truly\
  \ appreciated the panoramic masterpiece in which I stood. I took my next steps,\
  \ without fear."
