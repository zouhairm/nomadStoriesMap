Text: "The silence was punctuated by the sound of water gently lapping against the\
  \ wooden pier. In the distance, a lone bulb cast a minute glimmer of light, barely\
  \ illuminating the tin shed, its deep-green exterior blending into the darkness\
  \ that seemed to envelope us. I made my way towards it, cowering into my jacket\
  \ from the evening chill, the timber walkway creaking beneath my feet. As I got\
  \ closer, we could make out diners through the foggy windows and hear the steady\
  \ drone of conversation. \n\nI paused at the entrance, my freezing hands fumbling\
  \ on the rickety doorknob. Before I could push my way inside, the door creaked open\
  \ and I found myself staring into the deep blue eyes of a wizened old man, his face\
  \ riven by a thousand lines. Beckoning me in, he shut the door with alarming dexterity\
  \ and shuffled away. I sat at a wooden table, in a corner that accorded me the best\
  \ view of the tiny room. There wasn\u2019t much to it. The threadbare walls sported\
  \ the odd framed photo of a whaling boat. A large replica of a swordfish hung on\
  \ the far wall and a grimy old fishing net hid the ceiling above. A handful of mismatched\
  \ wooden chairs shared the space with towering piles of boxes and trunks. I could\
  \ see into the dimly lit kitchen, partially obscured by a small glass display containing\
  \ trays piled high with chunks of raw fish. \n\nA middle-aged lady bustled into\
  \ the room, pausing at each table to chat with the customers and replenishing drinks.\
  \ She looked over in my direction and hurried over. As she approached, she bellowed\
  \ in a heavy accent, \u201CHello! Do you want dinner?\u201D \u201CYes,\u201D I replied,\
  \ smiling gingerly up at her, \u201CCould I have a menu please?\u201D Looking perplexed,\
  \ she shook her head and said, \u201CNo menu. Come.\u201D Bewildered, I hastened\
  \ across the room behind her. Standing in front of the glass case, she pointed at\
  \ the chunky slabs of raw fish and said, \u201CMeat, ok?\u201D  Attributing the\
  \ mistake to translating error, I gently offered, \u201CYes, fish is ok.\u201D Brows\
  \ furrowed, she looked at me and said, \u201CNo. This is meat. Where are you from?\u201D\
  \ At that point I began seriously questioning my credibility as an omnivore, unable\
  \ to differentiate between fish and meat. Still confused, I replied \u201CBangladesh.\u201D\
  \ Her expression cleared as she exclaimed, \u201CThis is whale meat!\u201D Looking\
  \ at my astounded expressions she continued, \u201CYou are Bangladeshi. You like\
  \ shashlik? I can make you whale shashlik. You will like very much?\u201D she implored.\
  \ \n\nAnd that was how I found myself having succulent whale shashlik for dinner."
