Text: "People say the best things are the most difficult. I felt my soul longing for\
  \ change, so I chose to travel to Croatia! Six weeks working in a hostel in Dubrovnik.\n\
  First thing I saw when I arrived were the walls of the Old City. It was at night\
  \ and I could see the wide streets with its lights reflected on the stone floor.\
  \ I could hear people laughing and some jazz music at a nearby bar. The city vibrated\
  \ and I could feel it inside of me. \nI could talk about these feelings forever,\
  \ but this is a story about people.\nIf change was what I wanted, I'd made the right\
  \ choice. It was the first time I'd ever been in a place where what was written\
  \ on the signs made no sense. I could not even pronounce the name of the streets.\
  \ However, the most difficult was understanding the Croatians. My first impression\
  \ was not the best, people were hard and I was concerned about how the next weeks\
  \ would be.\nMy approach with the owner of the Hostel I worked with was gradual.\
  \ One day, she told me that she had always lived in the city with her family, but\
  \ when she was four they were forced to evacuate. During the war between Serbia\
  \ and Croatia, Dubrovnik was attacked and almost destroyed. A curiosity: the city's\
  \ roofs. The damaged roofs were replaced by new, orange ones. And viewed from above,\
  \ Dubrovnik is mostly orange.\nLater that day, I saw some bullet marks on the walls\
  \ and realized that the hardness of the Croatian people made sense, and that fact\
  \ made me want to know them even better. One thing is to read about a war and another\
  \ is to hear the story of someone and understand that what we learned in theory\
  \ was that person's life.\nDuring the time I was there I realized that Croatians\
  \ are people with good hearts, they're hardworking, caring. And that led me to a\
  \ reflection.\nDo people open themselves to really understand the local community\
  \ when they're travelling? Have they ever thought that maybe they're the hard person,\
  \ simply by not seein through the root of a custom or behavior? Getting to know\
  \ a local person without that understanding is not a real connection.\nIn Croatia\
  \ they went through deprivation, loss and grief. This shaped the way they interact\
  \ with the world. The story of one person made me have affection for an entire nation.\
  \ It made me open my mind, get over my initial judgments and to try to understand\
  \ what makes someone be what they are. \nI said goodbye to Dubrovnik while having\
  \ breakfast with my new friends, and I felt like I was a new person after this experience."
