Text: "\"Long may you run\" played the stereo, as we realized that we drove quite\
  \ far off Muscat. The Ramblers that we are, my brother and I; we were on a long\
  \ afternoon drive outside the city.\nOman's Settlement is confined along the coast\
  \ and so are the roads. With the Mystic Hajar Mountains running on one side and\
  \ the Turquoise Arabian Sea on the other, time wasn't a dimension anymore. Sigh.\n\
  I went on assigning characters to the massive rock formations over the mountains.\
  \ Despite each of it being asymmetric and \"Unique\", I could feel a certain sense\
  \ of order, a language in the vein of, connecting it all. Just when we were about\
  \ to take an exit, a small Brown Signage by the road reading \"Hawiyat Najm Park\"\
  \ got my attention and we followed it with curiosity. A couple of hours before the\
  \ sunset, it was still hot and sunny but the Cool breeze from the ocean made it\
  \ bearable and pleasant. \nWalking inside as the only visitors, we had no expectations\
  \ from the place marked by its remote location, only to prove ourselves wrong later.\
  \ The pathways guided by palm fringes on the sides lead to a colossal Sinkhole which\
  \ startled us right there! It was a Massive Sinkhole nearly 30m inside the earth\
  \ with an entr\xE9e made possible through very steep steps.\nAs I started stepping\
  \ down the Sinkhole, a board read \"Hawiyat Najm: The Falling Star\". Apparently,\
  \ the park is named after an old folklore which suggests the formation of the sinkhole,\
  \ out of a comet hit. The water inside was greenish and crystal clear making the\
  \ floor bed in sight. I dipped my feet into the water as I sat on a rock, seconds\
  \ before I feel a tickling sensation beneath my feet! Dozens of tiny fish nibbled\
  \ my toes, harmlessly, leaving me oblivious to my own self and the \"Civilization\"\
  \ that I belonged to.\nIt was the serene waters and the heat of the desert that\
  \ enticed us to take a dip. While the sky displayed the animated hues of the sunset,\
  \ we were soaking in the sanctum in full measure. It was strange how we had no idea\
  \ about its existence just a while ago. For nature is such a player, it hides the\
  \ beauty of it and we lost in our \"chores\", fail to seek it.\nOn the walk back\
  \ to our car, there was enough light to underline the silhouettes of the mountains\
  \ with each layer having a tint of its own. Walking away from the place we did not\
  \ utter a word. It was a feeling of contentment which we wished to hold on to for\
  \ some more time, I believe."
