Text: "I was sat on a bench overlooking a lake with lilies blooming on the surface.\
  \ This place looked idyllic. This bright morning the backpackers and the hotel goers\
  \ were united by the information pouring out of our audio headsets. The reality\
  \ sank in quickly; this place wasn\u2019t idyllic at all. I had sat down to listen\
  \ to survivor stories: stop 121 \u2018Loss of an infant\u2019, 122 \u2018Witness\
  \ to a killing\u2019, 123 \u2018Rape leads to shame.\u2019 Unknown voices spoke,\
  \ each turn on this field had a number, every number had a story, every story was\
  \ worse than the last. Men, women and children; no one was spared for no reason\
  \ other than: \u201C[it\u2019s] better to kill an innocent by mistake then to spare\
  \ an enemy.\u201D This was not just a field but a mass grave filled with over eight\
  \ thousand people. This tree was not just a tree but a tool used to smash skulls.\
  \ The location was Choeung Ek, fifteen kilometers outside the capital of Cambodia,\
  \ Phnom Penh. Known as the Killing Field, it is just one of the hundreds of places\
  \ where millions lost their life under the Khmer Rouge regime. \n\nFast forward\
  \ a few hours later and I\u2019m speeding through the traffic of Phnom Penh in a\
  \ tuk tuk. Driving beside me was another tuk tuk with two little girls. They excitedly\
  \ yelled out \u2018hello\u2019 continuously with wide smiles. I smiled and waved\
  \ back. We were going in the same direction creating a kind of tuk tuk chase, which\
  \ they found hilarious. Cambodia is known as the 'land of wonder' because of Angkor\
  \ Wat, but these two smiling faces marked Cambodia to me as the 'land of wondrous\
  \ smiles.' It wasn\u2019t just the two little girls; it was the old lady who smiled\
  \ and proudly showed me pictures from her travels and it was watching families gather\
  \ on the beach to celebrate New Years Eve with food, music and laughter. As I learnt\
  \ more about the country\u2019s recent dark history, the last thing I expected to\
  \ see were so many wondrous smiles. Yet behind those smiles there are moments to\
  \ help you remember that Cambodia is far from recovery.\n\nLets rewind back to this\
  \ morning. As I continued my walk through the Killing field, I glanced to my right\
  \ and saw an old man begging tourists for money through a fence. Then I remembered.\
  \  As I looked over hundreds of pictures of people who were brought to S-21 prison,\
  \ now known as the Tuol Sleng Genocide Museum. Then I remembered. This morning was\
  \ emotionally heavier than expected. Standing opposite the museum was my tuk tuk\
  \ driver. He smiles a wondrous smile and says: \u201Care you ready to go back now?\u201D"
