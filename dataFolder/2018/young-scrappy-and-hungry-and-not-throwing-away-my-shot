Text: "On April 2016, I found myself boarding a plane on my own for the first time.\
  \ I was on my way to Newark, NJ for a college tour and my family could only afford\
  \ one ticket. I had traveled without my parents before on a school trip. This was\
  \ different: no one was picking me up at the airport, I had no guide or itinerary,\
  \ and I had a strong desire to go on a reckless journey.\nI landed on a Thursday\
  \ afternoon, my schedule was clear until the next morning. As my parents drove me\
  \ to the airport, I half-joked about taking the train to New York City. My mother\
  \ threatened to turn around the car and take me back home if I so much as dared\
  \ thinking about it.\nHowever, once in the hotel, completely alone and over 2400\
  \ miles away from my mother\u2019s threats, I decided I would never forgive myself\
  \ if I missed that opportunity. It was not certain that I would go to school in\
  \ New Jersey. For all I knew, that was my only chance of ever going to New York.\
  \ \nI rushed to the train station before I could change my mind. My phone's battery\
  \ was at 36% and my GPS was playing tricks on me, I looked up the directions from\
  \ Penn Station and prayed that I would remember them. Once the train took off, I\
  \ typed a text to my parents and turned off my data, terrified of their wrath.\n\
  \nThe train stopped, I got out and blindly followed the hordes of commuters aboveground.\
  \ I was immediately hit by unknown sounds and scents all over. Dozens of people\
  \ started yelling at me, offering tours, Broadway tickets, and taxi rides. I smiled\
  \ awkwardly and walked in what I hoped was the right direction. It wasn't. Two blocks\
  \ later, I realized I was going West instead of East. I faked confidence and circled\
  \ the block hoping no one would notice my rookie mistake. \nOnce inside the Empire\
  \ State, I confidently pulled out my scarce life savings, it was barely enough to\
  \ go up to the 86th floor and it meant I would not be able to afford dinner. However,\
  \ that was the last thing on my mind as I stepped on the Main Deck and I got to\
  \ see in person what I thought I'd only see on Google searches. It was cheesy and\
  \ touristy, it also had been my dream since I was seven: to be able to see the Chrysler\
  \ building against the New York skyline.\nI spent four hours on top of the Empire\
  \ State, writing in my tattered journal and taking in the most beautiful sunset.\
  \ When I finally made my way back to the hotel I was not hungry and I was not scared.\
  \ For even if I never returned, that sunset at the top of the world would always\
  \ be mine."
