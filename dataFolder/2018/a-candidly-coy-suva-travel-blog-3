Text: "Welcome to Suva, Fiji\u2019s capital city - where the air is muggy, the coast\
  \ is concrete, and downtown boasts fewer trees than a New York City postcard. This\
  \ morning is consumed with the familiar screaming and shouting from the taxi stand,\
  \ mixed with the confabulation of babies in the apartments next door, Suva is full\
  \ of babies, and everyone is pregnant.  The heat is already sweltering so I take\
  \ a stroll down to MHCC, Suva\u2019s original shopping center, complete with air\
  \ conditioning, except on Sundays.\nThe fancy Australian coffee chain is filled\
  \ with expats sipping iced-lattes and complaining about the heat. Newspaper headlines\
  \ relay stories of tragic flash flooding in Nadi, Fiji\u2019s second major city,\
  \ where all the shimmering resorts are found. That's one thing Suva has going for\
  \ it, there may not be any beaches but there\u2019s hardly any storm warnings either.\n\
  In terms of night-life, Suva boasts an all-American 6-cinema complex complete with\
  \ current 3D movies and 1 liter disposable Coke cups that usually end up being kicked\
  \ into the ocean by unaccompanied minors.  For those seeking a more traditional\
  \ pass-time, Kava is the activity of choice.\nOften termed \u201Cgrog,\u201D the\
  \ kava root is a ceremonial drink, a staple for special occasions as well as being\
  \ consumed casually with friends.\_ It\u2019s effects are similar to those of Marijuana\
  \ but it\u2019s intake method is not; the crushed roots are folded by hand into\
  \ a bucket of water to produce a muddy texture which is then offered  to guests\
  \ one at a time by the Master of ceremonies.  The drink is sipped out of a hollowed\
  \ out coconut bowl which is filled to one of three sizes: the overflowing \u201C\
  Tsunami,\u201D the mid level \u201Chigh-tide,\u201D and the foreigners/beginner\
  \ bowl, \u201Clow tide\u201D.  Guests will usually be served first. As custom dictates,\
  \ remember to clap once before taking the bowl into both hands, and then knock it\
  \ back like a shot. Depending on the occasion, grog ceremony rules will vary in\
  \ level of observance. Not to worry, Fijians are very welcoming, follow their lead\
  \ and ask many questions. \nBeing a foreigner in Fiji can be the experience of a\
  \ lifetime, or a previous lifetime even. The best way to experience it is to allow\
  \ yourself to be flooded by the sensory perceptions of the kava root ceremony and\
  \ let yourself be taken on a journey to your tribal past."
