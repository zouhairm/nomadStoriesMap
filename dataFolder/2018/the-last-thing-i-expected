Text: "There was this point in my life when I didn't know which direction to go to,\
  \ I just knew which path I didn't want to stay on. Since little girl I've dreamed\
  \ about traveling the world. Left my home country with this idea, however I needed\
  \ to be back and thought I'll build up a life that I might enjoy there. But no,\
  \ once I experienced the traveler life I couldn't switch back anymore. New horizons\
  \ opened.\nThose five weeks that I spent in Romania with this thoughts in my mind\
  \ were quite energy draining and sad. I was eager to go again somewhere, anywhere.\
  \ I never considered Switzerland , although it's well known what a natural beauty\
  \ of a country it is. It was a last option for me, I don't even know why. Maybe\
  \ because it's Europe and too close? I accepted a job offer coming from Zurich for\
  \ 3 months. It was a way out of my sad stage of wanting to go somewhere but being\
  \ broke. 3 months in a beautiful country is not such a bad idea when you've got\
  \ no clue what to do with yourself and your life. I was sure once I completed my\
  \ 3 months work commitments I'll take off and go probably somewhere far away and\
  \ never look back. \nLittle did I know that once I land in Zurich and walk out to\
  \ the lake on a mid October afternoon I'll instantly fall in love with the place.\
  \ I can still remember that moment when time stopped for a second, my mouth dropped\
  \ open and I was mesmerized of the view I was staring at. I could see the mountains\
  \ in distance with snow on top, it was stunning. The falling leaves were colorful\
  \ and pretty, so much so that for a second I thought I'm in a fairytale. \n3 months\
  \ passed quickly and almost every day I returned to my spot by the lake to admire\
  \ the panorama that I liked so much. My heart started to feel strange when I thought\
  \ I have to leave. It didn't feel right to go away when I like it so much somewhere.\
  \ There was no need to leave. I got an extension, a one year contract and a big\
  \ smile on my face because I realized this is my place. Slowly I built up friendships\
  \ that will last forever I'm sure. Created myself a life, took up new hobbies, explored\
  \ the country, the world and got to know myself so much better. I found peace in\
  \ Switzerland and I truly felt home. 3 months turned into a year and slowly I completed\
  \ four years. \nThe last thing I expected was to settle down, yet still it happened.\
  \ From the initial 3 months I spent four amazing years in a country that I still\
  \ consider home."
