Text: "It's Monday morning, Prague's main train station is busy but the ticket desks\
  \ are processing customers quickly. \"Dobr\xFD den! Jedno do Plzne pros\xEDm\" I\
  \ say to the clerk in my best attempt yet at speaking Czech. \"Do Plz\u0148e?\"\
  \ she echoes back to me, stressing the \"nyeh\" sound that I had neglected to properly\
  \ pronounce. Nonetheless, my request is understood and I am handed a one way ticket\
  \ to the brewery city of Plze\u0148, or Pilsen as it is better known to speakers\
  \ of English and German. Taking the slip of paper in my hand, I smile as I walk\
  \ away from the desk, knowing I have successfully made a transaction without speaking\
  \ any English. \n\nIn the tourist blackspot that is Prague, one can get by on English\
  \ alone. However, despite being only about an hour away from the capital Plze\u0148\
  \ is a very different case. The fourth largest city in the Czech Republic often\
  \ feels like a much smaller town, giving off a very local vibe. Even with the sizeable\
  \ flow of tourists to the famous Pilsner Urquell brewery, English is not widely\
  \ spoken here. As a result of this, even a few words of Czech prove very useful.\
  \ \n\nDuring my first visit to the Czech Republic a year earlier I had no need to\
  \ learn the difficult Slavic language. On this occasion I travelled with my best\
  \ friend who was born in Plze\u0148. Over the course of this week I often joked\
  \ about the strange sounds of Czech, its lack of vowels, and how it made no sense.\
  \ Little did I know that this trip would be our first and last together.\n\nFollowing\
  \ his sudden passing in the year following our first time in Plze\u0148, I decided\
  \ that I would return to his hometown with a few other friends of ours and show\
  \ them around. This time out however, I felt it was absolutely necessary to at least\
  \ make some attempt at speaking the language. \n\nSo, with the help of a phrasebook\
  \ I taught myself some basic phrases, the typical traveller stuff; \"hello, goodbye,\
  \ please, thank you, I can't speak Czech, do you speak English?\"  While this wasn't\
  \ much it was certainly a major change from the words I already knew; beer and various\
  \ swear words.\n\nFast forward to our Bohemian pilgrimage. While my travel companions\
  \ act like your run-of-the-mill English speaking tourists, ignorant to the local\
  \ language, I find myself trying to make use the few words I now know, and feel\
  \ proud of myself when I do. \n\nIt may seem strange, taking pride in something\
  \ so simple, but having lost my direct connection to Plze\u0148 and its people I\
  \  feel I have to try and make one myself. And I will."
