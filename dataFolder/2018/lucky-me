Text: "This story  started in August 2014, when I decided to go from Saint-Petersburg\
  \ to Paris by my motorcycle alone. At that moment I\u2019ve never been in Paris\
  \ , it was my dream, to see and ride my bike in this gorgeous city.\n\nSo, I had\
  \ some plan but Universe decided that all my plans everytime have to change.. So\
  \ in 5 days I arrived in Amsterdam. There I\u2019ve met a russian friend of mine\
  \ Andrey. He was travelling on his motorbike as well but with company of his friends.\
  \ When he found out that I\u2019m going to Paris he asked me: \u201CWould you mind\
  \ if I go with you?\u201D.\n\nIn 2 days we arrived in Paris. It was late evening,\
  \ we were so tired, our couchserfing-girl wasn\u2019t online, so we just went to\
  \ the first cheapest hotel and left our bikes in front of the hotel. Next morning\
  \ I was taking a shower, imagining about our forthcoming great day in Paris, and\
  \ how we are drinking flavored coffee with divinely delicious croissants and\u2026\
  \ Suddenly my dreams were abruptly interrupted by shout of Andrey:\u201DYour bike\
  \ has gone!!!\u201D. Oh-la-laa!\nOur first day in the capital of France we spent\
  \ at the main commissariat of Paris. It was so romantic)). We returned to Russia\
  \ in 10 days on Andrey\u2019s motorbike. \n\n3 months later I received a letter\
  \ from \u201CLost and found\u201D of Paris. I was informed that my motorcycle was\
  \ found. I was extremely happy at that moment. But I had one big problem. To this\
  \ moment my bike was already out of register in Russian Police and I didn\u2019\
  t have the documents any more. But I had their copies. In this case a person can\
  \ transfer his rights to someone who can pick up your transport. My French friend\
  \ Christian took my moto to his house in Lille and his son repaired my bike and\
  \ was keeping it 2 years for me, because I had a possibility to go to France only\
  \ in 2016. By that time my Russian friends helped me to recover all documents so\
  \ that I could cross European border on my motorbike without any problem.\n\nSo\
  \ in June 2016 finally I was reunited with my motorbike. After that I started my\
  \ way to South of France to the volunteer project through Paris again. This time\
  \ everything was ok)). In 2 days I arrived to Frontignan. First day I\u2019ve met\
  \ a lot of great people from different countries and it was great. But when I saw\
  \ first time our camp-leader, I thought:\u201DOh, my God!! What an asshole!\u201D\
  . \n\nOn the third day I fell head over heels in love with him. \nIf my motorcycle\
  \ wasn\u2019t stolen - I wouldn\u2019t have met this guy - It was last thing I expected.."
