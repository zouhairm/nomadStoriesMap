Text: "I had always wanted to go to Japan ever since I was about 12 years old. I kept\
  \ telling myself I was going to do it next year...and then 2015 happened. My grandfather\
  \ who had always told me about how much he loved Japan and always shared his stories\
  \ passed away while I was at college. After that, I decided as soon as I finished\
  \ college I would do what it takes to save the money for Japan. \n\nI tutored, worked\
  \ a full-time job with overtime, did online surveys, and worked myself into a frenzy.\
  \ After a year and a half,  I had settled into a relationship and almost forgotten\
  \ about Japan until I saw a post on Facebook about a job opening for teaching in\
  \ Japan. At that point, I had found a good job and I was in what I thought was a\
  \ good relationship, but I just didn't feel happy. I decided to apply and ended\
  \ up getting the job.\n\nIn late 2016, after I decided to take the job in Japan,\
  \ everything started to fall apart again. My relationship ended on awful terms,\
  \ my dog died, and I was no longer excelling at my job. Then the election results\
  \ came in and that was the final straw for me, I knew this was a sign to go. I pushed\
  \ through all the negative thoughts in my head and came to Japan.\n\nIt was my first\
  \ time living or even traveling abroad since I was about 13. At first being there\
  \ felt so surreal, like a dream. Even now it sometimes feels like I'm living someone\
  \ else's life. I've had an amazing time and seem to make friends with new people\
  \ everywhere I go. I'm slowly getting better at Japanese, but it's almost time to\
  \ say goodbye to Japan. Some part of me doesn't want to leave, but another part\
  \ of me says that once again it's my time to leave the nest once again. Japan I\
  \ will miss you dearly."
