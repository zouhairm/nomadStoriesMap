Text: In 2014  I was happened to be in Aligarh on my way to Bareilly,  my friend Nimra
  choosed AMU for preparation of MBBS entrance test , I was staying there for two
  days as she requested me.  She came to see me along with her room mate who was a
  student of fine art . She interduced her to me as Lucy. Lucy was so intelligent
  and ambitious student of fine art  , she wanted to be professional and full time
  artist by creating good work of art , it  was her first encounter with a person
  who connected with the art world, she was very pleased and confident . She spoke
  gaily and lightly and she found it convenient to continue in the same tone . She
  looked down so that I had no means of knowing  how what I had said affected her
  and than a couple of minutes later I went to say good-bye to Lucy and Nimra. I thanked
  them for their kindness to me during my stay in Aligarh after a decent interval
  got up to go . Although,  after having very close and face to face meeting , i didn't
  share my contact with her neither she asked me  to pass on  .  Anyhow , she succeed
  to get manage it.  In my opinion it was co-incident to meet such a people .
