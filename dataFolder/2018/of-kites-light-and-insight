Text: "One evening on the rooftops of Jaipur, ten thousand birds whose colour and\
  \ manner of flight I had never seen before fluttered in the evening sky. It did\
  \ not take me long to realise they were actually kites. Though small and simple\
  \ in their handmade design, they flew so beautifully that mistaking them for birds\
  \ no longer seemed so foolish. The sun bled the last of its light into the sky,\
  \ glaring off of their bright colours that can only be displayed as boldly and shamelessly\
  \ here in India. It was then for the first time in what felt like an eternity, the\
  \ clamour of the traffic below became a soft drone, the intense animation of movement\
  \ and light became a calming blur, and pandemonium in it's most unruly form, somehow\
  \ became equilibrium.  I felt acceptance, humility, and peace.\nI lingered here\
  \ until the sun had set.  The kites set with it, reeled into the horizon by their\
  \ flyers on the rooftops. When I finally rose to leave, it seemed this moment had\
  \ more in store for me. Completely without warning, lights began lifting into the\
  \ sky from everywhere I looked. Like the kites, they were simple handmade lanterns,\
  \ released one after the other by children on every rooftop I could see. It was\
  \ not long before these fragile lanterns mobbed the evening sky in their thousands,\
  \ bearing the equally fragile hopes and dreams of those below into the sky. \n\n\
  This was but one of many moments of sponateous beauty I experienced in India. \n\
  \nAstutely observed by a fellow backpacker I travelled with as an 'assault on the\
  \ senses', This bizarre and wonderful place is quite certainly that, and comes at\
  \ you whether you are ready for it or not. While overwhelming and at times exhausting,\
  \ the pure and fierce barrage of life that constantly hits you here is invigorating\
  \ to the deepest parts of the human consciousness. Wherever you go, you'll find\
  \ yourself surrounded by joy, pain, majesty, poverty, life, death, and everything\
  \ in between.\n\nWhatever you may or may not believe, something I can only describe\
  \ as spiritual was astoundingly present everywhere I walked here, and brought a\
  \ peace one would think impossible to find amidst such chaos. A mere month here\
  \ was not enough, and while sad to leave, im certain I'll return here again. I hope\
  \ you might come too, and get your senses mercilessly assaulted as I did. For be\
  \ it a sound, a sight, a taste or touch, India is one of this world's very few places\
  \ in which everything that might cross your path, is simply nothing less than extraordinary."
