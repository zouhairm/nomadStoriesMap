Text: "\u2018What on earth brought you here?\u2019 \n\nIt was a pretty good question\
  \ when I thought about it. \n\nEric and Jason, best mates and lifelong Scots sitting\
  \ beside us, are both dying to know. The two had overheard my wife and I sighing\
  \ in satisfaction at Mother India Cafe\u2019s exquisite Saag Paneer and Tikka Makhni--that,\
  \ in and of itself, had been enough to warrant a raised eyebrow. It isn't often\
  \ that visitors to Scotland seek out the Indian food, and after hearing that we\
  \ were honeymooning from Seattle the two were unable to contain their curiosity.\
  \ \n\n\u201CSo you\u2019re telling me you got married in one of the rainiest places\
  \ in the world and decided to brighten things up a bit in Scotland?\u201D Jason,\
  \ a fast-talking, blue collar construction worker, eyes us skeptically. Erik, his\
  \ friend \u2018from the desk side of things,\u2019 is similarly bemused over the\
  \ lip of his beer.\n\nAfter several days of drizzle, the irony is not lost on me.\
  \ \n\nYet here we were, having the time of our lives. We had figured that our 3-week\
  \ honeymoon was the best chance for a full tour of Ireland and Scotland we would\
  \ get, but after ten days of meat-and-potatoes we needed to break up the culinary\
  \ monotony.\n\nYou would only find Mother India\u2019s Cafe by knowing what to look\
  \ for. The casual off-shoot of its famous progenitor down the road, it was refreshingly\
  \ different from anything we\u2019d had on the trip so far. My wife and I were careful\
  \ not to bash the fantastic meals we\u2019d found in Ireland, most notably at Muckross\
  \ Park\u2019s Yew Tree Restaurant, but we needed our spice fix.\n\nErik and Jason\
  \ understood. They\u2019d been weekly guests at Mother India\u2019s for years. They\
  \ were less kind about Irish cuisine, but we forgive them a bit of nationalistic\
  \ rivalry.\n\nThe conversation turns to the d\xE9cor as my wife and I admire the\
  \ rich woods and bright tapestries on the walls, but Erik points to the rows of\
  \ grayscale portraits instead. He draws our attention to one in particular.\n\n\u201C\
  The owner\u201D, he explains, and tells us a bit about him. Now a casual acquaintance\
  \ of our Glaswegian regulars, Monir Mohammed\u2019s shy, jowly smile disguises a\
  \ man who has revolutionized Indian cuisine in Glasgow. When I say as much, both\
  \ Erik and Jason seem pleased--they clearly have a soft spot for the Indian restaurateur.\
  \ \n\nA little book on the counter, \"Mother India at Home\", is his characteristically\
  \ understated biography. Erik throws a copy of it on his tab and hands it over after\
  \ a quick scrawl on the inside of cover:\n\n\u201CHappy honeymoon, E & J\u201D."
