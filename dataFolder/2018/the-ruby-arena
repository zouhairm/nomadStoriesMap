Text: "It was my first time in Andalusia. All around me in those weeks in Andalusia\
  \ had a flavor of ancient tradition, a strong echo of past times. I was not fully\
  \ aware of this until I arrived in Tarifa. It was September but still hot and plenty\
  \ of sun during days & relative warm during nights. It was one of the year perfect\
  \ time to enjoy beach life and to get lost in the narrow streets of the town center,\
  \ tasting local food & wine. \n\nIt was one of the first night in Tarifa. There\
  \ was music coming from the streets, the city was cheerfully lighted up, people\
  \ were walking all around talking, eating and dancing. It was the celebration of\
  \ the Virgen de La Luz (literally the Virgin of the light). Behind the b&b, a quite\
  \ noisy entertainer, screaming at the microphone, was calling and inviting people\
  \ to go and have look at the show. His voice was so attractive I could not resist\
  \ it. There was a small Plaza de Toros. The arena was white with ruby doors matching\
  \ the inside red bottom section, a preview of what was going to happen. Quite old\
  \ but well maintained, simple in comparison to the famous ones, nonetheless charming.\
  \ \n\nAs soon as I stepped my feet inside and walked through the ruby door, I felt\
  \ like entering into the famous arenas of the past, seen several times on movies\
  \ but this time, instead of ferocious beasts, the bull was there in all its proud\
  \ and tenacious posture. I would not say the bull was elegant but he was ready for\
  \ the fight, although zero were the chances to succeed. A secret admiration for\
  \ the fearless creature spread around my body .\n\nThe crowd loudly encouraged the\
  \ toreador to kill the bull. I was standing there but could not really realize what\
  \ time was, completely surrounded by people, being part of the whole and detached\
  \ at the same time. I stand there on my feet, my entire body was present but I was\
  \ looking at myself from the outside: numb and unable to make a move. Inside my\
  \ mind was running so fast, overwhelmed with only one thought left.....please make\
  \ the bull survive..I was sadly aware of the impossibility of my desire nevertheless\
  \ I wanted to grab this thought so desperately. \n\nThe more the toreador pierced\
  \ the bull again & again, the more I suffered. I was holding my breath, the crowd\
  \ pushed the toreador to make the final move. In less then a second everything was\
  \ over...I could see ruby only."
