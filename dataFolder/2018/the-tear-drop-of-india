Text: "I believe that riding which ever animal there is on Earth would be just a lack\
  \ of respect towards Nature, specially if we are talking about Elephants. Wise,\
  \ gentle, spiritual, huge creatures, we should most certainly follow as an example\
  \ to our personal inner achievements. \nWe arrived at The Elephant Freedom Project\
  \ after two hours on the road, so excited about the concept and of course getting\
  \ to see an Elephant is already a big moment but to touch one and walk together,\
  \ feed and hug, that I can tell it was the best memory I\u2019ve kept so far in\
  \ my life.\nHis keeper loved him like a son, together we washed him for hours in\
  \ the local river, we walked side by side through the unknown tracks of sriLanka\
  \ with a feeling of greatness, protection and gratitude. But it was more than this,\
  \ we learned all there is to know about elephants and we got to meet the local children\
  \ with their big smiles and cute faces staring at us like we were out of this planet.\
  \ I must confess it felt good.\nOne thing I didn\u2019t expect was the story of\
  \ Nilema, the Elephant. His private owner brought him to this sanctuary so that\
  \ he could get well treated before he started again with work. Holidays for Nilema,\
  \ they said. After resting and recovering, he will be giving rides to tourists again.\
  \ Nilema has no choice and neither has his keeper to be separated once again. \n\
  This Project is powerless towards higher families and animal exploration companies,\
  \ the only thing they can do is provide good moments of care and love when they\
  \ are dropped there to rest. \nThe founder believes that one day they'll have enough\
  \ money earned from conscious tourists, thanks to this project, to buy all the explored\
  \ elephants of SriLanka and keep them all for a permanent vacation right under their\
  \ arms. Nilema would be the lucky first one if he can make it until then. \n\n|\
