Text: "I try to make my way through the crowd. I'm completely surrounded by people.\
  \ I take advantage of the spaces I find, and I slip between them to keep moving\
  \ forward. My only thought is to reach an open space and give a breath of fresh\
  \ air to get rid of the trouble.  I just try to move forward as fast as I can. At\
  \ this point, I think that a bee in its hive could move more easily than me.\n\n\
  I am in Marrakech, it's mid-June, and there is a horrible dry heat weather which\
  \ I cannot get rid of. I'm lost somewhere in the central artery of the Spices Market.\
  \ It is a magical place, where your senses get a boost from the inducements they\
  \ receive from every corner surrounding you. Intense scents, both sweet and bitter;\
  \ unclassifiable colours; velvety carpets and worked wood with ancient techniques.\
  \ There is no other place in the world where the five senses work harder at the\
  \ same time.\n\nMy stroll tours between merchants stalls, which follow one behind\
  \ the other, covered with colourful awnings supported by somewhat disordered old\
  \ wooden beams. Shimmering rays of light sneak between the fine overtures of the\
  \ fabrics, leaving a dim atmosphere inside the enclosure. I stop before some Moroccan\
  \ merchants with their whitish djellaba and their worn babouches. I'm really lost.\
  \ It's easy to get lost in here. The boulevards and streets just cross each other\
  \ disorderly, resembling as if I am in a moving labyrinth. \n\nSweat drips down\
  \ my forehead, I feel them. My shirt is completely soaked. I desperately need to\
  \ hydrate, I'm extremely weak. Water evaporates from my body through each of the\
  \ pores in my skin. I'm exhausted and dizzy. I need someone to help me get out of\
  \ here. Suddenly I stumble over a raised cobble and fall to the ground. Everything\
  \ blurs, everything halts. Only peace. My senses turn off and my muscles relax.\n\
  \ \nI feel a citrus flavour running between my lips and fills me with vitality,\
  \ slacking my thirst. I slowly open my pupils, and a deep black look crosses my\
  \ eyes. There is a young lad staring at me. I turn to him with a: \"Thank you\"\
  . With his expression, I realise he hasn\u2019t understood a word. Next, I extend\
  \ my hand with my palm upwards in a greeting manner, he stays silent looking at\
  \ me and answers by squeezing my hand tightly. He quickly understands my gesture!\
  \ There are social interactions that cross cultural borders, gestures that are common\
  \ to all of us. No other word is needed. The boy runs away happily, turns a corner\
  \ and finally I lose sight of him."
