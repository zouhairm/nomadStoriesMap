Text: "I always feel like breaking into song when I think of Barcelona. The culture,\
  \ the atmosphere, the weather. It\u2019s so vibrant, natural and has a great relaxed\
  \ vibe. I can see why it\u2019s a tourist haven. It gives in copious amounts, from\
  \ breath-taking beaches, to quaint cafes sure to make your mouth water. I visited\
  \ Barcelona with my family for my 21st, it was definitely the best way to celebrate.\
  \ There is something so special about Barcelona. It\u2019s cosmopolitan, it has\
  \ it\u2019s own traditions, ways of doing things and ultimately you feel apart of\
  \ something.  \n\nLa Rambla\nLa Rambla a street in central Barcelona, thrives with\
  \ locals and tourists.  A tree-lined pedestrian mall, it stretches for 1.2 kilometres\
  \ connecting Placa de Catalunya in the centre with the Christopher Columbus Monument\
  \ at Port Vell. La Rambla can be thought of as the hub of the city, it has a lot\
  \ to offer, including stalls selling a variety of goodies, outdoor restaurants and\
  \ street artists performing daily.  \n\nBarceloneta Beach\nBarceloneta Beach is\
  \ truly stunning, with golden sands and rippling waves.  The most distinguished\
  \ and popular beach in the city. During the summer months it\u2019s tourist galore\
  \ from morning till night. You can walk along the promenade, which is over a mile\
  \ long, if you walk on it late into the night you will see people passionately dancing,\
  \ roller-skating, doing yoga, playing volleyball, swimming and working out at the\
  \ outdoor gym. I also thoroughly enjoyed looking around the Picasso museum. A picture\
  \ sure does paint a thousand words. I was awe-struck with the amount of emotion\
  \ that was portrayed in each and every painting. I found it fascinating trying to\
  \ work out what each painting represented. There was such a vast range of work and\
  \ so much talent by one man. I must say, I now view Art in a completely different\
  \ way, it comes in so many forms, shapes and stimulates so much feeling. Definitely\
  \ the best part of the holiday.\n\nCarrer dels Carders\nCarrer dels Carders oozes\
  \ character and charm. Alsur caf\xE9 caught our eye. I ordered a green tea latte\
  \ and a piece of lemon meringue pie and OH MY GOSH was that pie incredible!  Without\
  \ trying to sound like a M&S advert, that pie was unlike any other pie, it was on\
  \ a whole new level.  \n\nWhile I did think Barcelona would be a brilliant experience\
  \ I underestimated this spectacular city. It has endless amounts of charismatic\
  \ charm,it's like a sinewy man..extremely hot, but you don't expect so much substance,\
  \ vibrancy and personality."
