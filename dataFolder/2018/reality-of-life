Text: 'Today''s people have many more conveniences than the generation before. Today
  we enjoy the simplicity of life with electricity, for example. Modern appliances
  like refrigerators, microwaves, and electric lights were only dreams of overworked
  housewives 100 years ago. Today we have cars that get us from place to place faster
  than ever before, computers that do most of our thinking for us, and even probes
  and shuttles to explore space. In addition, our new way of life has allowed people
  to mix cultures. Today anyone can go to one of our huge shopping centers-another
  modern convenience and buy a Japanese television, clothing made in China, or a Swiss
  watch. This interchanging of both products and ideas has allowed today''s generation
  to have the best of all worlds. Unfortunately, negatives come with improvements
  in lifestyle. Life today is much more stressful and rushed than it was a century
  ago. People are always looking for more hours in the day. Time to relax or slow
  down does not exist in modern society. Life is more expensive, more hurried, and
  more competitive than in 1902. These things have contributed to the rise of things
  like depression, drug use, and divorce in the past 100 years.


  As we can all see, the last century has had its good and bad points, but, in my
  opinion, the good outweighs the bad. We can all consider ourselves fortunate to
  have come so far. The improvements of the twentieth century came with a price, but
  it was a small price to pay.'
