Text: "No matter how hard you are impressionable: you will never find \u201Cletzte\
  \ erwarten\u201D[1] in the heart of this country. This city is alive from the head\
  \ to the bottom, 24/7, winter and summer, visit for the first time or 99th. \nIt\
  \ was my first trip alone, being a teenager. Going up from the subway, I observed\
  \ the city, suddenly felt thirsty and decided to buy a water. Berliner shop looked\
  \ old and small, but when I came in I saw an army of multicoloredly dressed people\
  \ with a strange make-ups and hairs. They shouted so loud, and were crazy, most\
  \ seem to be drunk but funny simultaneously. I pulled out my phone to be sure it\u2019\
  s not a Halloween, but then put it back to my pocket because I remembered it was\
  \ a summertime right now! Then one of them gave me a Pride flag. A man said: \u201C\
  it\u2019s a parade, little, freedom day in the city of freedom! Have fun today as\
  \ much as possible!\u201D I thought that if I saw couple of such people in the small\
  \ shop it would be no amaze at all, but  hundreds! It was the last thing I expected\
  \ that day. \nCity of freedom? What it means?! Everything is allowed? No! It\u2019\
  s Germany, impossible! \u201CDas Gesetz ist vor allem, here\u201D[2]. You can feel\
  \ it with your soul and ..eyes. My eyes have been wondering till the Parade ended\
  \ up in the deep beer night. It felt like all Berlin people came out from everyday\
  \ boring routine to share their craziness with others mainly in Kreuzberg district.\
  \ By the way, to be among this crowd is a good way to practice German!\nBesides\
  \ my obsession on travelling alone I loved history of the Middle Ages. To be honest,\
  \ Berlin has nothing in common with this period. After noisy Parade days I decided\
  \ to change an atmosphere. An old sailor Friedrich helped to reach another bank\
  \ of river Spree. Coming closer I saw a beautiful old building, suddenly thought\
  \ \u201Cthat must be from the 19th century\u2026\u201D. \u201CThat\u2019s a Ballhouse\
  \ Riviera\u201D-he said. Although, there was an enclosure around the building, I\
  \ ran straight away to it. This place had a lot of fun, parties, beautiful men,\
  \ women and children, well-dressed, good mood, food and drinks, dances from the\
  \ 19th century till the times of Third Reich. What is left? Only building\u2026\
  \ At once my soul and eyes again were shocked, \u201Dmusic will never play here\u2026\
  again\u201D.\nI closed the door of the Riviera and told Friedrich that I hate and\
  \ love Berlin at the same time! \n\u201CWhy?\u201D, \n\u201CBecause the last thing\
  \ I always expect here is astonishing and frightening but unforgettable\u2026\n\n\
  [1]-last expectation \n[2]-The law is above all"
