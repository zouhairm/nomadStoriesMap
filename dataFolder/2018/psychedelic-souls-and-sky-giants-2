Text: "\u201C\xA1Cuidado!\u201D a voice shouts, as a quetzal\u2019s six-metre wingspan\
  \ catches a gust and soars upwards, rippling my hair as I duck. The giant bird lurches\
  \ as its reins pull taught, and begins to dance proudly back and forth on the rising\
  \ wind.\n\nHundreds more kites start to unfold around us: some miniature, some cartwheel\
  \ sized, and others lurid leviathans of painted rice paper stretched over colossal\
  \ bamboo frames. Cheers from the crowd echo around the tombstones every time a kite\
  \ takes to the sky, battling with the autumn wind. One mammoth multicolour creation,\
  \ two months in the making, crumples to the ground after ten minutes airtime. Locals\
  \ whoop.\n\nWinds chase lingering souls from this little Sacatep\xE9quez graveyard\
  \ and into the afterlife.\n\nPetals snatched off graves swirl around us in a psychedelic\
  \ cyclone. A single teal feather breaks free and spirals downwards. A boy jumps,\
  \ catches it and fist pumps the air. He uncurls his hand to inspect the treasure,\
  \ then presses it into my palm. Ancient Mayans traded with quetzal tail feathers\
  \ as currency. Enchanted, not tourist but amiga, I kiss his cheek.\n\nThe audience\
  \ swells, market hordes bursting over into the cemetery and between crypts. Freshly\
  \ laid flowers are trampled as people climb graves and jostle for the best view.\
  \ I aim for a safe place to stand but a kicked wreath lands at my feet and I falter.\n\
  \nStopped dead, I see an old man fight against the throng to hold up rope around\
  \ a newly dug rectangle. His silent grief unseen by the boisterous crowd. He's trying\
  \ to protect the grave. A kid barges past, flattening the makeshift fence, one foot\
  \ falling obliviously on recently churned earth. With a battle cry, he was gone.\
  \ Sighing, the elder rakes over the footprint with weary fingertips, picks up the\
  \ rope and returns to his vigil.\n\nAbout to make a clumsy gesture, I finger the\
  \ coins in my pocket but brush something soft. I pull out a turquoise feather. It\
  \ isn\u2019t much, but\u2026 I hold it out to the elder. His old eyes are startled,\
  \ then calm. A locket sized photo smiles up from between flowers as he presses the\
  \ feather to his lips. He produces a rusty Zippo and on the third strike sets it\
  \ alight. We watch synthetic cinders float away on the wind.\n\nAs dusk falls and\
  \ ritual kite burning begins, I pick my way slowly back. I imagine myself as a freed\
  \ spirit moving like chimney smoke toward the afterlife. A meaty sizzling and a\
  \ pang of hunger jolts me back to the mortal plane.\n\nNo longer quite just a tourist\
  \ at a kite festival."
