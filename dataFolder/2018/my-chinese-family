Text: "Jocelyn and I couldn\u2019t have been any more different. She was Chinese,\
  \ had never left China and had no interest in western culture; I was a thoroughly\
  \ westernized Indian who had travelled all over Asia. Like most Chinese college\
  \ students, she spent most of her time studying, whereas I wanted to travel, meet\
  \ new people and understand local culture better. I had grown up with no extended\
  \ family, and had always wondered what it would be like to be part of a large close-knit\
  \ family; as it turned out, she already had one.\n\nWe met in a calligraphy class\
  \ at Tsinghua University. It was friendship at first sight, no doubt kindled by\
  \ my selfish desire to befriend anyone remotely Chinese in my quest to learn the\
  \ language and culture, offering my nearly perfect spoken and written English in\
  \ return. We started spending a lot of time together.  \nOne day she invited me\
  \ to her hometown to spend Chinese New Year with her family. To the Chinese, family\
  \ is paramount and being invited to celebrate Chinese New Year with them is a great\
  \ honor. \n\nI was the first foreigner they\u2019d ever met, but was immediately\
  \ treated like a family member. Jocelyn gave me her bedroom and moved into the study.\
  \ When I tried to protest, she made an excuse about how the Wi-Fi connection was\
  \ better in the study which would be useful for her late night study sessions. Jocelyn\
  \ is a militant vegetarian but her mother, thrilled that I shared her love for pork\
  \ knuckles, made them for me regularly.\n\nHer great grandmother prepared a feast\
  \ and we all made jiaozi together, as Chinese families usually do for the New Year.\
  \ I noticed a bust of Mao, and the great grandmother explained that the bust reminded\
  \ her of how the Cultural Revolution had reduced her family to eating nothing but\
  \ rice for weeks on end; quite a contrast to the feast now on offer.\n\nThe women\
  \ of the family took me to the town\u2019s communal bath, where we all bathed naked\
  \ together. Some evenings, Jocelyn\u2019s cousins took me to karaoke bars where\
  \ I learnt some popular Chinese songs. Other evenings, Jocelyn and I would accompany\
  \ her father on his post supper strolls and he would try to improve my pronunciation.\
  \ \nThe youngest cousins were initially quite shy and would run away when I tried\
  \ to speak to them in my broken Chinese. Eventually they began to trust me enough\
  \ to hold my hand while walking and even take naps in my lap. \n\nI was with them\
  \ for two weeks, and by the end I had an extended family of my own for the first\
  \ time."
