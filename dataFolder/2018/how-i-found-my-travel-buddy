Text: "There are a few people in this world you feel a deep conection with. Do you\
  \ know that feeling when someone talks and it feels like he speaks directly from\
  \ your soul? You can have conversations for hours and you lose feeling for time\
  \ and space. Let's call them soul mates. I met one of mine in Paris and I didn't\
  \ see it coming.\n\n\u201ETomorrow a friend from russia comes to visit me. Well,\
  \ she is actually more then just a friend... but anyway you can stay and join...\u201C\
  , he said with a wink. That's the awkward way my couchsurfing host Rafa asked me\
  \ for a threesome.\n\nI got along with Rafa pretty well. We had some nice chats\
  \ but that was all. I had already spend one night at his place in the south of Paris.\
  \ It was a small student dorm room. I slept on a matress right next to his bed.\
  \ There was no space for privacy. Which is normally no problem for me but in these\
  \ circumstances... That's just not what I wanted.\n\nThe next day, I packed my things\
  \ and kind of fled. Aiming to find a last-minute host in Paris. I had similar situations\
  \ before and one of them ended up with me sleeping in a dingy motel room for $100.\
  \ Luckily it was different this time. Pretty fast I found a new host via the couchsurfing\
  \ App. So I made my way through the tram network of Paris to the other end of the\
  \ city.\n\nWhen I arrived, my new host Louis picked me up from the tram station.\
  \ His boss just told him that he will have to work the next day. Normally Louis\
  \ doesn't host couchsurfers when he has work but he didn't want to let me down because\
  \ it was already late at night and his apartment was a bit outside of Paris. It\
  \ would have been impossible to find a new host at this time, in this area.\n\n\
  At this point I was already grateful to have found Louis.\n\nHe worked till late\
  \ night but we took the time afterwards to cook delicious midnight meals and talk\
  \ for hours about life. I felt a conection to him right away. I ended up staying\
  \ at his place much longer then expected. When I finally told him I had to leave,\
  \ I could tell he felt the same way, by the look on his face. He promised to come\
  \ visit me in Germany and he did.\n\nToday we are planning our trip together to\
  \ Cuba... Well actually that's not true. We both don't like to plan our trips. So\
  \ we will just meet up in Havana and see what happens.\n\nFor two years I travelled\
  \ as a solo traveller. It was awesome! But as much as I love travelling alone it\
  \ is priceless to travel and make memories with a friend who feels, thinks and loves\
  \ life the same way as you do."
