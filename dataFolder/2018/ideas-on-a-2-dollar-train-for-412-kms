Text: "345 days since I left home. I\u2019m on a cheap train in Northern India, sitting\
  \ on the junction amongst wagons where wanderers and stowaways meet, I start writing\
  \ down my thoughts\u2026\n\n\"The heat and desperation force us to make poor and\
  \ impulsive decisions, but offer life lessons and new ways of appreciating life.\
  \ Ironically, those made by the lack of satisfaction of physiological needs result\
  \ in the most valuable lessons and hence, the consolidation of ourselves.\nThis\
  \ is the most important \u201Creality\u201D I discovered when I was 18 and left\
  \ my country with a 20-euro budget per day for a Eurotrip. One with little structure,\
  \ sleeping anywhere I could, eating a baguette throughout the day and learning from\
  \ strangers\u2019 hearts. A trip where entropy, stoicism and asceticism described\
  \ my day to day, inspired by hunger, weariness, and the self-inflicted sense of\
  \ limitation. I constantly thought of myself as Fogg, from Auster\u2019s Moon Palace,\
  \ who by own decision lived on the streets and internally criticized any other that\
  \ was not on the same situation, generalizing them as bourgeoisie. Misperceptions\
  \ like this and new feelings came up to the thinnest layer of my skin, I was envious\
  \ and self-centered. These feelings and hunger, made me accept leftovers, take bread\
  \ from restaurants, and even think of robbery. I got to know a new part of me, the\
  \ inner yet latent part of everybody we need to know to appreciate life by itself\
  \ and grow happier. And here I am, proving that formula to discover new \u201Crealities\u201D\
  \ and build upon them\u2026pushing myself to grow.\"\n\nAfter 25 hours, I found\
  \ myself in a van with reduced sitting space, the heat made me sweat from all pores,\
  \ the dust entered the windowless van and sticked to me, with a driver not familiarized\
  \ with breaks, only with a nepali-themed honk. My mind was overwhelmed and I couldn\u2019\
  t control the negative thoughts and feelings, but suddenly, I felt in peace. Ironically,\
  \ I had never felt so fulfilled, calmed and happy, maybe my focus on minimizing\
  \ all the factors which got me fed up made me use that strong energy in my favor\
  \ to create a peaceful state of mind, one I didn\xB4t know. I closed my eyes, felt\
  \ the wind, the dust, I stopped hearing and stopped being there\u2026I was conscious\
  \ of my-self, my body and my thoughts.\n\nFor me \u201Cthat\u201D is the outcome\
  \ of any situation that pushes us to the edge, we need to slow the pace, breathe\
  \ and wait to keep growing, learning and unlearning from ourselves. \u201CThat\u201D\
  \ was the start of my life, a nomad one."
