Text: "My name is Jessie Jordan and life has been a series of decisions that push\
  \ me to the edge. It's hard to know where it all started. I routinely get that itch\
  \ to hop on a plane and experience a new place. The other day I bought a cheap plane\
  \ ticket from Ft. Lauderdale to Baltimore for next weekend. I want see what happens.\
  \ I don't have anything planned, or even have a place to sleep yet. All I know is\
  \ that I believe in my self and the opportunities that exist all around me. I want\
  \ to tell you about my big adventure to the cheetah capital of the world \u2013\
  \ Namibia.\n\nWhen I met Dr. Laurie Marker aka \"the Cheetah Lady\" I was finishing\
  \ up an internship at the Natural History Museum in Pacific Grove, California. She\
  \ had just given an awe-inspiring talk, and I had a portfolio to show her. When\
  \ she saw my work, she said something like \u201CIf you can make it to our headquarters\
  \ at the Cheetah Conservation Fund, we would love to work with you.\" \nFrom that\
  \ moment on, I was dead set on getting there despite my dwindling funds. Plane tickets\
  \ were about $1500 at the time, and I barely had enough money to make next month\u2019\
  s rent. So I developed a GoFundMe page. \nI drew all 36 cat species of the world\
  \ and sent posters to the people who donated $25 or more. Eventually I reached my\
  \ goal and found myself in Namibia working with Laurie on a children's book. It\u2019\
  s a true story about an orphaned cheetah cub that she had raised. \nFor four weeks,\
  \ I was living out of a roundeval, which is basically a mud hut in the shape of\
  \ a circle. \nWhen I wasn't busy volunteering on the farm or gathering material\
  \ for the children's book I was painting landscapes and writing in my journal.\n\
  Some days I got to help feed and exercise the resident cheetahs on the sanctuary.\
  \ This involves standing in the back of a moving pick up truck waving meat around\
  \ to entice the cheetahs to chase their meal. I was almost struck by lightning -\
  \ TWICE. One night I snuck into the back of a land rover, so I could be part of\
  \ a scientific night safari with a few staff members. Another night, I dreamt that\
  \ I was alone in the bush and a cobra was biting me. I woke up to a baby mouse travelling\
  \ up my leg from the inside of my pajamas. One day I woke up to a baboon at my front\
  \ door.\nOn the taxi drive back to the airport someone robbed my phone right in\
  \ front of me at the gas stop. It turned into a wild goose chase. I never got it\
  \ back and was deeply upset at the time. Still, it was one of the richest experiences\
  \ of my life."
