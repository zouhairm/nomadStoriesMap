Text: "Nine o'clock on a January morning and the sun was already burning. Killing\
  \ a day in Phuket, I wandered down to the docks; I shunned the Ko Phi Phi-bound\
  \ horde of farangs and turned instead to the grubbier, industrial pier next door.\
  \ There, on a whim, I bought a cheap ticket to Ko Yao Yai, a place I had never heard\
  \ of, and sat waiting on a dirty bench in the sultry, rusting harbour, among the\
  \ small crowd of my fellow travellers, all Thai and largely Muslim, and the stacks\
  \ of cargo that travel to the islands on passenger boats: a 17-inch TV, a 'spin\
  \ mop'.\nI climbed precariously onto a pitching speedboat and took a seat at the\
  \ back. The three engines next to me whirred one by one into life. We coasted the\
  \ sticky harbour, past the ranks of corroded fishing ships under a pounding blue\
  \ sky, and then entered the brilliant sea. We picked up speed, watched Phuket recede\
  \ into a hot haze, and sped past islets of white rock.\nHalf an hour later we made\
  \ landfall on mountainous Ko Yao Yai. For someone used to the dull palette of northern\
  \ Europe, to arrive in such a place is to step into a blaze of colour - white, green,\
  \ blue. I walked across the glaring sand until I found an outcrop of black, Martian\
  \ rock. I picked my way across it; once or twice I slipped, and my shoes filled\
  \ with water.\nI trespassed onto the beach of a nearby resort, attracting odd looks\
  \ as I went from the sunburned Westerners baking on the sand, inappropriately dressed\
  \ as I was in long trousers, shoes, and socks. I turned away from the littered beach\
  \ and the tourist villas, and towards the interior - the sandy road that led towards\
  \ the mountains, to see what I would find. I followed this deserted path, past scorched\
  \ farmland, through forests of mangrove and palm, past rubber plantations (this\
  \ island, I later learned, still lives off rubber as much as tourism). And I kept\
  \ walking, on and on in the searing heat, dripping with perspiration, under the\
  \ fizzing tangles of electric wires. I could hear a faint, eerie wail rising from\
  \ the forest. Still I walked, out of water now and thirsty. \nSuddenly I was in\
  \ a village - a cluster of low, wooden houses with straw rooves. Every man on the\
  \ single, sandy street wore a skullcap, every woman a hijab. A sign in hand-painted\
  \ Arabic script indicated a 'Masjid al-Islamiyah'. I sank down in the breeze beneath\
  \ the palm trees, opposite a makeshift mosque with a fibreglass dome, and listened\
  \ to the muezzin intone over the loudspeakers, 'Allllllaaaaahhhh-u Akbar...'"
