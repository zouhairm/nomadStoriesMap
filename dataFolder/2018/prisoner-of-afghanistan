Text: "Mullah Karim is the leader of a Taliban group located in the Shindand area.\
  \ His left arm is unnaturally contorted and he is unable to straighten it. The bones\
  \ have mended improperly. Mullah Karim is seeking an opportunity to travel to India\
  \ to have his arm operated on. For this he needs money. \nKarim has two wives \u2013\
  \ one in Shindand, the other in Herat. But women are not enough for him. When my\
  \ interpreter Moshin met with him at Karim\u2019s home in Shindand to prepare for\
  \ filming, Karim showed him two bachi baazi, \u201Cdancing boys\u201D. These are\
  \ teenage boys, kidnapped from their families or from the street who are trained\
  \ as servants and sex slaves. Later, after several weeks have passed, I ask myself:\
  \ \u201CHow could I have trusted a man who rapes children?\u201D\nLate in the evening\
  \ of April 17, at a hotel in Herat, Moshin calls Mullah Karim and invites him to\
  \ come meet me. Upon arrival, Karim overflows with mawkish friendliness. I don\u2019\
  t like his eyes. I disliked them already in the photos of him that Moshin sent me\
  \ a few months earlier, after their first meeting. Then however, I didn\u2019t allow\
  \ myself to be conscious of it. My desire to be able to film ex-Soviet soldiers\
  \ now under Karim\u2019s command, blocked my natural intuitive ability to sense\
  \ danger.  \nFor the following day, Mullah Karim promises to arrange meetings with\
  \ both Russian Talibans, former Soviet soldiers. I am to meet with Mullah Naeem\
  \ in Shindand in the morning and with Ali Adraskan in the evening.\nThe alarm on\
  \ my cell phone wakes me at 3:30. I have a coffee. I have a bad feeling. Karim is\
  \ already waiting for us outside. In the driver\u2019s seat of their Toyota Corolla\
  \ there is a man who he introduces as his sister\u2019s husband. \nWe are able to\
  \ drive on without having our documents checked. After driving for about an hour\
  \ we approach Shindand, a small city that is regarded as one of the Taliban\u2019\
  s largest support centers in Afghanistan.\nOur car turns off the main road. \"We\
  \ didn\u2019t take this route last time\", says Mohsin quietly. A narrow winding\
  \ bumpy road takes us past numerous clay houses. Turns and curves, then I catch\
  \ sight of men with machine guns a few meters away. The car jerks to a stop. Men\
  \ surround the car in an instant. Through the windshield, a very young man points\
  \ a revolver straight at my face. I notice his European facial features. My life\
  \ is now different than before. It could end now. My body could stay here. I hope\
  \ sincerely that we are not tortured before being killed. I do not think about surviving."
