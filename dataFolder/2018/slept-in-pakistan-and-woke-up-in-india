Text: "Within minutes my body began to look like 20 years of soup stored in a latex\
  \ glove, while chirpy locals hiked right past without breaking a single sweat. Dressed\
  \ like the MS Paint version of a chubby Superman, I tied the soft woollen shawl\
  \ around my neck and continued the uphill trek. Words of motivation (and lies) rang\
  \ in my ears. Almost there, five more minutes they echoed as I dragged on like a\
  \ twisted troglodyte. 45 minutes of \u201Cfive more minutes\u201D later, the rocky\
  \ path finally gave way to aggressive shrubs and suddenly I was standing in the\
  \ last village at the tip of the country. \n\nIt was immediately evident that Turtuk\
  \ was an anomaly.\n\nHunched in one of the most remote corners of the world, this\
  \ predominantly Muslim hamlet has very little electricity, no wifi, language barrier,\
  \ and busy faces.  Everything the eyes could see that was once claimed by Pakistan,\
  \ now sits with India, only a handful of miles from the de facto border - the Line\
  \ of Control. It is little surprise that the village is ripe with geopolitical appeal\
  \ and geographical allure. \n\nTurtuk is surrounded by mountains so foreboding they\
  \ are practically fiveboding. Cutting through the middle was the brooding River\
  \ Shyok, Uyghur for river of death. And in an almost comical contrast to the cold\
  \ grey behemoths are the seven different hues of lush green grass, flowers on every\
  \ terrace and trees pregnant with apricots.\n\nThe narrow lanes lead deeper into\
  \ a surreal collection of houses stacked in cobblestones, nervously held together\
  \ with wood. A two-storey structure seemed to have galvanized when no one was looking\
  \ and was covered in grape vines with kittens strewn about in several stages of\
  \ anarchy. Through the spiral staircase to the second floor is a room barely lit\
  \ by sunlight, walls draped in arrows, rifles and trinkets, and in the centre stood\
  \ the direct descendant of the Yabgo Dynasty - a young gent clad in white t-shirt\
  \ and jean shorts - like a glitch in the conservative matrix. \n\n\"Give hundred\
  \ rupees first\" a precocious little girl grinned from ear to ear when asked for\
  \ directions to the way out. In a zone where mostly Balti is spoken by its 3500\
  \ residents, she had mastered an important command in English. For a village mired\
  \ between two politically divorced nations, Turtuk hospitality provided the most\
  \ important insight into the human condition \u2013 that a friendly smile is the\
  \ coveted currency."
