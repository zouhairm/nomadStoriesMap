Text: "Further is about distance, but also about the conception of distance in itself.\
  \ It's about how you imagine that crossing an ocean would lead you to a piece of\
  \ heaven and then realise what is really standing in front of you. So here I am\
  \ - a barely 20 year- old French girl- leaving Europe for the first time to discover\
  \ what is called the American Dream. It's been years since I live for it. I used\
  \ to study and work and earn money for it. And when I'm on the plane, that funny\
  \ dream is about to be achieved. In August 2017, I land in L.A. at 6 pm. But at\
  \ that time, I'm not aware of what I am going to experience there. A mix of terror\
  \ and astonishment. A real remake of that famous \"Blade Runner\" written by Davis.\
  \ Along the streets, I am facing the opposite of freedom. Hundreds of homeless people\
  \ are staring at me with the same odd look than Michael Jackson dressed like a zombie\
  \ in \"Thriller\". They are simply walking, and they only ask one or two dollars\
  \ to live.\nI run until my hostel door. At the top, a big pool on a rooftop attracts\
  \ many beautiful people. They are having fun, drinking cocktails around the pool\
  \ and laughing loud. I don't really find my way between those two extreme sides\
  \ of the society. I don't understand how they can live and exchange together. I\
  \ quickly understand that they do not exchange directly. They are divided by a law\
  \ - which is not really the law of nature - and they tend to stay away, living in\
  \ the same world that is however so antagonist.\n\nHow can I go further ? I sometimes\
  \ ask myself looking at this ignominy. A bunch of people is running on their gym\
  \ rolling carpets while others are naked in the same Street lying on the floor.\
  \ Nobody seems to care, the policeman doesn't know how to deal with it. \n\nNoon-\
  \ I didn't finish my salad. I don't want to throw it away, especially knowing how\
  \ people are starving here. I start to look for one or two people who would be happy\
  \ to have a free meal. It seems that they don't want to talk. The first one tells\
  \ me that she can't eat because she \"has no teeth\". The second one is lying on\
  \ the floor and tells me that he's \"not hungry\". It's the same story for the two\
  \ or three others. So I decide to finish my salad later. And I run at the train\
  \ station for Santa Monica Pier (...)."
