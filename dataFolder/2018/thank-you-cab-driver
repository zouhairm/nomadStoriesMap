Text: "I do not know how to decide. Maybe I am not brave enough. In front of me I\
  \ can see the endless Sea and an infinite sky. One can notice different layers of\
  \ deep blue colours. In the dark I can eye the bright blue from the Sea. The night\
  \ disbands and I am standing in the twilight for a couple of moments. The sun is\
  \ stretching her arms and if you are aware, you can hear her quite, drawn-out moan.\
  \ I still feel my insecurity. But what did my teacher used to say? \u201CJust do\
  \ it.\u201D That is easier said than done. I turn around to leave the sky and the\
  \ sea with it breaking waves behind me.\n\nI am going through the alleys of \"Hoi\
  \ An\". Different kind of lanterns adorn in all imaginable colours on every house,\
  \ every wall and every little bridge. Dainty looking Vietnamese women are crossing\
  \ my way. I am starting to go faster, until everything around me seems to merge\
  \ into one another. It feels like I am running through a play of colours, away from\
  \ the decision I have to make. \n\nAs we sink in the cooling seats of the cab, I\
  \ try to describe to the Vietnamese cabdriver that I want to go to the next bus\
  \ station, which would bring me to the next city. I am not sure if he understands\
  \ me but he signals us that he understands. After a while, I am totally absorbed\
  \ in my thoughts, my companion next to me says \u201CI think we are not driving\
  \ to the bus station\u201D. And before you can say knife we are standing on the\
  \ road side with our backpacks in front of a resort. The cabdriver did not understand\
  \ us, obviously. We grin at each other. \n\nMeanwhile everything around us seems\
  \ to shine orange, as if you put a smooth whiff of silk in the colour of blaze around\
  \ everything. The earth turns slowly away from the sun, which descends more and\
  \ more in the horizon. We are looking at my return flight ticket. I am supposed\
  \ to sit in the flight right now, back to Germany. I could not decide whether I\
  \ am taking the flight or not. I wanted to decide after the bus ride to the next\
  \ city, or at the airport. But the decision was made for me, just like that. It\
  \ was meant to be this way. I can see how he smiles at me, before the orange around\
  \ us turns darker until it is a nondescript colour of dawn. A little bit of blue.\
  \ A little bit of grey. I close my eyes to trust. And that was the last thing I\
  \ have expected. That some random cab driver will decide on my future. Sometimes\
  \ you just need to look what life plans for you, without making the hard decision.\
  \ So, thank you cab driver. Thank you for not sending me home."
