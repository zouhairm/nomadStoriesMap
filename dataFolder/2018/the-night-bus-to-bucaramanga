Text: "\"It's not what you think.\" The man sitting next to me chuckled and wagged\
  \ his finger back and forth as if to erase the thought. My friend Claudia had suggested\
  \ that if I didn\u2019t speak, I might pass for Colombiana. As if my fleece, hiking\
  \ boots, and general lack of fashion didn't scream \u2018gringa backpacker\u2019\
  \ to these natives in the homeland of flawless females. My seatmate not only knew\
  \ what I was but had correctly guessed the thoughts that widened my eyes as they\
  \ darted around the bus trying to take in the sudden burst of activity inside the\
  \ night bus to Bucaramanga.\n\nHe caught my eye again as he wordlessly took hold\
  \ of a small, soft package wrapped in plain brown paper and passed it over the seat\
  \ to the woman sitting in front of him. More than twenty packages made their way\
  \ from the back of the bus to the front where a young couple collected them in what\
  \ looked like a giant re-useable shopping bag on wheels. The bundles must have been\
  \ stashed before my friend and I had boarded the crowded bus in Barranquilla. I\
  \ glanced back, hoping Claudia could visually corroborate my neighbor\u2019s reassurance,\
  \ but her head was propped against the window and her eyes were closed.\n\nI\u2019\
  d been a little nervous to take the bus in this part of Colombia. Even friends in\
  \ Bogot\xE1 had advised against our route from the Caribbean coast to the mountain\
  \ town of Bucaramanga where we would visit Claudia\u2019s family. But I'd been traveling\
  \ for months by then and the universe had been good to me. My confidence, though,\
  \ did not stop my worst suspicions from flooding in as soon as I saw the parcels\
  \ emerging from seat bottoms.\n\nI watched the silent, seamless operation anxious\
  \ and impressed until the last package was safely stowed and the bag was lowered\
  \ to the broken asphalt on a dark corner about half a mile before the next town.\n\
  \nWhen the bus was rolling again, my neighbor turned to me, smiling conspiratorially,\
  \ and explained in a low voice that we had not in fact just helped traffic 100 pounds\
  \ of Colombian cocaine (he raised his eyebrow at me reproachfully), but rather 100\
  \ pounds of Venezuelan flour. \"Como?\"\n\n\"Yes, for arepas!\u201D He responded\
  \ to my timid Spanish in perfect English. \u201CThat man and his wife own an arepas\
  \ stand. Flour is subsidized in Venezuela so it is much cheaper for them to buy\
  \ it there and avoid the import tax at the border.\u201D\n\n\u201CThe driver and\
  \ all of these people don't mind helping them get around the law?\u201D\n\nMy neighbor\
  \ shrugged and smiled. \u201CTheir arepas are really good.\u201D"
