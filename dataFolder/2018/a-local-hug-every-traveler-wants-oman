Text: "When you travel to a new country or a new city, you want to experience the\
  \ place head-to-toe. Discover and indulge in its heritage & culture, language, traditions\
  \ and with the people. Every traveler seems to look for a \u2018connection\u2019\
  \ that is warm, a habby (the letter \u2018P\u2019 does not exist in the GCC) smile\
  \ to progress through the day. I traveled from Bombay; a city known for its hustle\
  \ and bustle, fast-paced life to a country entirely opposite, but in the stunning\
  \ Sultanate of Oman, you can make a connection with sensational beaches, spectacular\
  \ mountains and kind-hearted Omanis. Top 5 experiences you must discover on your\
  \ trip.\n#1. Majestic landscape of Jebel Shams:Best way to connect with nature is\
  \ heading to a destination about 250 Km from the city; 3000 meters above sea level.\
  \ Jebel Shams - part of the Al Hajar mountain range is known for offering the true\
  \ \u2018experience\u2019 of beauty. The place offers a camping site and serves as\
  \ a perfect spot to beat the heat; adding a bit of adventure to your trip. If you\u2019\
  re into trekking, there is no better place that offer routes; quite strenuous and\
  \ enthralling.\n#2. Walk at the turtle reserve, Ras Al Jinz:Oman is known for its\
  \ white-sand, virgin beaches with crystal-clear waters, most of which are secluded\
  \ that face the Indian Ocean with soaring sand dunes or rugged rocks. One of the\
  \ places to connect with wildlife is called Ras Al Jinz, it offers an ultimate experience\
  \ at night with Turtle Watching. The experience of observing green sea turtles laying\
  \ their eggs is a moment to remember and the tour begins in pitch dark (in batches).\n\
  #3. Desert adventure at Wahiba Sands:Oman\u2019s beauty lies in the deserts, but\
  \ to experience and connect with the authentic Arabian thrill, Wahiba Sands(239\
  \ Km) away from the main city, offers a magical stillness of the desert. During\
  \ the day, you can hop on to a 4x4 SUV and enjoy a unique sand dune bashing experience.\
  \ At night, light a bonfire and camp under the stars for a perfect conclusion to\
  \ your trip. \n#4. Local Shopping at the Old Muttrah Souk:The best way to connect\
  \ with the people, is to create \u2018wastas\u2019. (the Arabic word of building\
  \ a connection). The Souk which is located at the Muttrah Corniche is a must-visit\
  \ destination which is operated by the local market shop sellers - you will find\
  \ an array of Omani and artifacts. Built keeping in mind the Omani heritage, the\
  \ Souk offers a pleasant view under the modern timber roofing facing the beautiful\
  \ Corniche.\nGo, make your local connection now!"
