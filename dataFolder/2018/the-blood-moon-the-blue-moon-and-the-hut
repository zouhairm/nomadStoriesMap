Text: "I stood at the foot of Mount Hikurangi \u2013 the tallest non-volcanic mountain\
  \ in New Zealand\u2019s north island, on the eve of no less than three celestial\
  \ events; a super moon, a blood moon and a blue moon. The info board at the beginning\
  \ of the climb stated nine kilometres of easy farm road, but the litres of sweat\
  \ I donated to it would beg to differ.\n\nI\u2019d sought permission from the Ngati\
  \ Porou, the local Maori iwi, who revere the mountain as sacred. It is also the\
  \ first location in New Zealand to see the sun rise each morning and an excellent\
  \ vantage point to witness the once in 152-year event. The weather forecast set\
  \ the scene for a perfect night.\nAn unforgiving incline road snaking it\u2019s\
  \ way over rolling green farmland, littered by thousands of sheep. Nothing to compare\
  \ scale to but other violent rock giants that are as equally intimidating. Four\
  \ hours of uphill before the path turned to a near vertical goat trail. Pushing\
  \ through thick gorse and thistle with cow patties to soften the blows of my heavy\
  \ feet.\n  \nAt last, the hut! The bright red roof had been less than a freckle\
  \ for the past two hours, now it appeared rusty and faded.\n\n \u2018Lock your food\
  \ away at night or expect rats.\u2019 Was written on a cupboard inside.\n\nAllowing\
  \ for plenty of hiking time I arrived early. Time enough to cook a meal and bask\
  \ in the highland serenity. My intention after dinner was to get a sleep in before\
  \ attempting the summit in the early hours of the morning.\nAs the sun slunk behind\
  \ Hikurangi, it became eerie. A harsh lesson was learned: weather can change suddenly\
  \ on a mountain. Howling winds and battering rain on a corrugated iron roof are\
  \ like a toddler on a drum kit only paying attention to the symbols. The sweeping\
  \ clouds eclipse the eclipse.\n\n1:00am-As I lay eyes wide open the door to the\
  \ hut flings open. A small framed man with a glaring head torch burst in, interrupting\
  \ my lack of sleep. He immediately sits and peels a tangerine. Nick was his name,\
  \ informed me that he had every intention of reaching the summit despite the grizzly\
  \ conditions.\n3:00am\u2013Nick leaves the hut. I build the courage to follow knowing\
  \ full well there may be nothing to look see at the top. Regards to human safety\
  \ are gone, I endure the washing machine to cover another 2.5km of tussock and 400m\
  \ of vertical scree. It\u2019s terrifying. \nReaching the summit with nothing but\
  \ wind burning my eyes I\u2019m left feeling disheartened, but also accomplished\
  \ and relieved knowing I can finally start my descent."
