Text: "The last time I saw Rita, my bright pink lipstick mark was still glistening\
  \ on her right cheek since last night. We\u2019d spent the entire car ride from\
  \ Manresa to Barcelona chattering but as the lights of Barcelona drew closer, the\
  \ car grew silent. When we reached her doorstep, we hugged once, twice and ran back\
  \ to one another for a final one.\nA week into my youth exchange, she invited me\
  \ to meet some of her friends. Most movies had confirmed that Europe encouraged\
  \ \u2013 nay, expected \u2013 spontaneity, so I said yes. I got lost in the Barrio\
  \ Gotico. This area of the city was wildly akin to Hephaestus\u2019 labyrinth, and\
  \ Google maps had abandoned me. Now I was on the phone trying to describe something\
  \ apart from graffiti-ed walls to a woman I\u2019d never met before. After 10 minutes\
  \ of frantic talking, we realized we were under identical arches 50 metres from\
  \ each other. Despite myself, I kissed the air next to her cheeks; something I was\
  \ still getting used to. \nBarcelona\u2019s Pride Celebrations had a foam party\
  \ that we attended. The avalanche of foam drowned us. We couldn\u2019t breathe over\
  \ the blanket of foam encasing us. From a small window of fresh air, I saw a large\
  \ pair of brown eyes staring back at me wildly, just as panicked as I was. We didn\u2019\
  t need words to communicate. We grabbed each other\u2019s hands and made our way\
  \ out of that death trap. The cab ride home heard more personal stories than expected\
  \ of fresh acquaintances. \nShe always knew the perfect thing to say. It intrigued\
  \ me endlessly. The house party she was throwing gave me the perfect opportunity\
  \ to study her. In a room full of people, languages, and drinking games I was unfamiliar\
  \ with, I realized why.  Rita was always listening. She didn\u2019t hear you half-heartedly\
  \ or speak over you to prove a point. She listened to you because she actually wanted\
  \ to understand your perspective. \nRita had political posters pasted around her\
  \ house. She passionately spoke about Catalan identity with a holistic knowledge\
  \ of history and zero inclination towards violence. She translated songs for me\
  \ that had political propaganda and participated in the revolution. She wants to\
  \ study Conflict Resolution.\nShe rolled her own cigarettes and talked about feminism.\
  \ She\u2019d pour you local drinks, tell you history behind it and then agree that\
  \ your ex was an asshole. She\u2019d never let you talk yourself down. She would\
  \ dance to 80\u2019s songs like there was no tomorrow. She opened my mind to new\
  \ things. And now I have a home in her."
