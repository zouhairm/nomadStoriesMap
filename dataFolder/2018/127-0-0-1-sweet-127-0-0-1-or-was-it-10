Text: "Have you ever been grateful for a hiccup? Like relief-coursing-through-your-veins-reaching-your-sand-filled-eyes-in-the-form-of-mist\
  \ kind of grateful? Well, the hiccup that woke me up on my flight back to India\
  \ deserved it.\nWhy?\nCoz' the last scene I remembered from la-la land, had a deliriously\
  \ cute French dude morph into the smarmy auto-driver from Pathankot (Himachal,India)\
  \ I'd hitched a ride from, clamoring for a 'simple kiss' right next to the sleepy\
  \ railway station. Crossover much? I'd wondered snarkily as I looked around with\
  \ sleepy eyes.\nCue plane announcement, cue crying baby 1, cue crying baby 2. Voila!\
  \ Headache initiated.\nRecapping a few days..\nWalking into Pauline\u2019s place\
  \ in Toulouse was unsettling & I couldn\u2019t figure out why. The rooms were warm,\
  \ kitschy & everything you\u2019d expect out of a 20-something maker\u2019s home.\
  \ With translucent cupboard of a bathroom, a gazillion tea varieties & the quirkily\
  \ restored furniture seated next to a cozy little fireplace. It was Heavenly. But\
  \ decidedly out of my league when her monthly rent came up in a later conversation.\
  \ \nCity is worth it though. With all its majestic architecture, museums nothing\
  \ short of palaces, serene riverbanks with noisy sparrows, a town square replete\
  \ with a whammy of A Capitole, with each sycamore standing proof to it's place in\
  \ history & every shop boasting through bronze initials (hell, even Mc Donald\u2019\
  s Golden Arches were twinkling in bronze pride). This was a city with cobbled roads\
  \ that led you to quaint street lamp lit corners & with gourmet food popping out\
  \ of the tiniest of Cafes. Sigh.\n\nBut amid the jetlag fueled race towards finishing\
  \ my fest project, prepping for a talk & experiencing Toulouse, the original nag\
  \ was still there. It baffled me how everyone, especially folks like Pauline who\
  \ lived here temporarily, seemed to embrace the place, as their place. And there\
  \ I was with my room, with its half-filled suitcases, its bare walls & an absolute\
  \ lack of belonging when it came to Bangalore, a city I\u2019d been living in for\
  \ the majority of an year. I\u2019d gone from a starry-eyed, ever-surprised & nervous\
  \ kid to a cynical & slightly reticent woman. Through no fault of the city, I\u2019\
  d started stereotyping it & stopped understanding the reasons it celebrated for.\
  \ Stopped trying. Period.\nThe realization taught me a couple things, worth losing\
  \ sleep over. \nAfter landing home, I took my time unpacking.\nIt was time I connected\
  \ to Bangalore. And get myself a hammer for that darned Photo Frame."
