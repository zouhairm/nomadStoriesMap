Text: "Staring at my new black all-star my mind was full of thoughts while the speaker,\
  \ a man in his early thirties, explained theories about Earth, I was at an Astronomical\
  \ Observatory in a city close to my hometown in Brazil on a school trip, my best\
  \ friend John beside me was triggered by the new information he was receiving. I\
  \ was at my freshman high school year trying to find out what to do with my life\
  \ in the future, will I be a doctor? I thought. I needed a sign to know what to\
  \ do next. \nThe room we were in was small but the ceiling was high with red columns\
  \ on the walls, it was like a mini auditorium it even had a video projector. I reached\
  \ for my friends\u2019 bag for a piece of the chicken pie we took, it was forbidden\
  \ to eat inside but my stomach was starting to growl. Lowering my mouth to the bowl\
  \ John nudged me. But after he said anything everybody started standing, we looked\
  \ at the man that was speaking he was heading to the spiral stairs at the right\
  \ corner of the room. I ran to be one of the firsts to go upstairs leaving John\
  \ behind.\nWalking up, I found myself in a chamber with a huge telescope. There\
  \ were three other students in front of me in the line they told us to form, and\
  \ John was nowhere to be seen. My hands started shaking when I felt the cold in\
  \ there and my wool gloves weren\u2019t helping. And in a blink, I was next. As\
  \ I came closer to the telescope I lowered my back to put my eye on it, I put the\
  \ right one at the eyepiece.\nWow! Is that a real planet? I thought. The astrologist\
  \ at my side told me; that\u2019s Jupiter. Wait I can see Jupiter! Like the real\
  \ planet Jupiter? I kept thinking, even though it was just an orange spot on a black\
  \ screen. But it was different; it was not like on the computer. It was\u2026 Undiscernible!\
  \ I was amazed by that little dot. I couldn\u2019t help my thoughts; I felt my mind\
  \ spinning.  The biggest planet of all was so small. But here on Earth, I can see\
  \ every single corner of it! The world just had gotten insanely smaller. Seeing\
  \ Jupiter opened my mind to new possibilities. At that moment I decided to see every\
  \ place on Earth, every single one. \nAfter everybody was done we went outside to\
  \ see constellations but in smaller telescopes. And soon enough it was my turn.\
  \ I saw little light dots in the sky. It was so beautiful like a draw. And now I\
  \ wanted so badly to go see this stars close to the Eifel Tower! Or even at the\
  \ Empire State Building. I wasn\u2019t going to be any doctor to be stuck in a hospital;\
  \ I was going to be a traveler!"
