Text: "When I arrived in Guinea-Bissau to do some volunteering, I was far from expecting\
  \ that few days later I would be on the middle of nowhere, completely in the dark,\
  \ trying to come back to this incredible country.\nThis adventure starts when me\
  \ and my friends have decided to go to Senegal for a few days, during our stay in\
  \ Guinea.\nAfter visiting Senegal, when we arrived at our station after 36 hours\
  \ on a bus that rains inside, we noticed that our visa had a microscopical letter\
  \ who said that visa was only available for one entry on the country. Ok, we were\
  \ dumped on a place we didn\u2019t know anything or anyone with one of us sick without\
  \ food or drinks (because the trip should take \u201Conly\u201D 20 hous) and we\
  \ couldn\u2019t cross the border. What we do?\nPortugueses are known for their capacities\
  \ of manage unforeseen circumstances. We even have a special word for this that\
  \ is \u201Cdesenrascar\u201D! So, putting this supper power in practice, we found\
  \ where Guinea\u2019s consul from Senegal lives and we went there. We spoke to his\
  \ secretary but apparently Sundays are a very special days for him and they didn\u2019\
  t want to pass another visa for us.\nTwo hours after arriving the bus stop, we are\
  \ back on the starting point. As like a miracle, we remembered that we have a teacher\
  \ who teach the children of Guinea\u2019s president. After many calls, we finally\
  \ reach the secretary of the president and she, touched by our volunteer plan, manage\
  \ our entry without paying any visa! One problem was solved but after all this bad\
  \ luck is 10pm and the border was closed yet.\nAlthough, no problem! Our new friend\
  \ Mr. president told the police to let us in, we just must cross the border by walk,\
  \ without any lights on the road, any charge on the phones, only with a light that\
  \ an old man gave me on my birthday. On the Guinea side of the boarder, we already\
  \ had a car waiting for us to giving us a lift to the nearest village. After 3 hours\
  \ on the road, we finally went to our host family on Guinea who wait us with a typical\
  \ (and delicious!) soap. Probably it was one of the best meals I had on my entirely\
  \ life!\nOn the next day the president called us to go to lunch with him on the\
  \ palace of republic. So, we went to a beautiful palace with our working clothes\
  \ plenty of dust and dirt to go to lunch with the President of Republic.\nToday,\
  \ I don\u2019t regret even a bit of having gone to Senegal. If not, how can we have\
  \ one of my best life stories?"
