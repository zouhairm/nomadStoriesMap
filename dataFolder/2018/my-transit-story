Text: "My dad is in the Army. Hence, \"never settle\" has been an integral part of\
  \ growing up. I made new friends every two years, learned the diverse ways of living\
  \ across India & made local connection everywhere I went.\n\nThe last thing I expected\
  \ was to settle in a 9-5 corporate job. But here I am struggling every morning with\
  \ the city traffic. Not that I don't like my work - I love it. I love it for the\
  \ money I get - let's be honest. It helped me buy my first camera, sponsor all the\
  \ travel & satiate my wanderlust. It helps me work with people across the Asia Pacific\
  \ on their marketing campaigns, discover the differences between the cultures. I\
  \ just don't like the feel of sitting in a closed space, not able to look out and\
  \ see the sun rise & set. This feeling of \"unsettled settledness\" is what drove\
  \ me to start \"The Transit Story\".\n\nI don't want to just stop at traveling.\
  \ I want people to hear me and reach out to me to get help on how they should plan\
  \ their travel to a particular place. I am no expert but I do know I am better than\
  \ any money making agency. I follow three travel mantras:\n\n*Takeaway is the essence\
  \ \n\nI still enjoy the Kalimotxo I learnt from my  AirBnb host in Spain. Blowing\
  \ onto a coca k'intu in a gesture called phukuy looking towards the sun is something\
  \ I will always remember from my travel to Peru. Friendships made while you travel\
  \ is the most beautiful takeaway - make sure you stay connected and help each other\
  \ in the time of need.\n\n*Don't see all but live what you see \n\nI don't try to\
  \ cover everything at once. I save up at least 15 days of leave to explore one place.\
  \ Even the 15 days spent witnessing the great wildebeest migration in Kenya was\
  \ less for me to absorb the beauty of this country. You will experience authenticity\
  \ once you become comfortable in a place and people start knowing you. It's always\
  \ after few initial days that you will actually realize if you love a place or not.\n\
  \n*Let travel influence you \n\nI am now taking up Spanish and preparing to get\
  \ the DELE. I do believe had I not traveled to Spain, I wouldn't have understood\
  \ the beauty of this language. Try to make it a part of your life - it can be a\
  \ small gesture like saving a postcard to framing the photos and making a beautiful\
  \ wall out of it. If the culture really inspired you, dive deep into learning about\
  \ it more. Also, share! This world is a small place and everyone should get to learn\
  \ how each one of us is different from the rest. \n\nThis is my travel story!"
