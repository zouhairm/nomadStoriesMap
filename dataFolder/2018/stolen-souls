Text: "Planning my around the world trip, I was careful excluding programs I didn\u2019\
  t consider good for my taste, such as riding elephants, caring for caged tigers,\
  \ visiting the village of \u201Cgiraffe women\u201D. But, inadvertently, I found\
  \ myself as one of those human zoo tourists, in an agricultural village in Hoi An,\
  \ in Vietnam.\n\nI arrived at that rural area by chance, coming back from a day\
  \ in the beach. The scenery was pleasing and interesting. Suddenly, I was already\
  \ photographing some workers in their daily lives. Later, a charming little girl\
  \ appeared, and we interacted a lot. Among laughs, photos. I took some of her, and\
  \ she took some of me. My camera was almost a toy. We had a great moment.\n\nArriving\
  \ at the hotel, I reflected that what I'd done was not very different from the attitude\
  \ of those who already go out with the intention of framing a daily life that is\
  \ not their own. I thought of a way of retribution and decided to print some photos\
  \ and deliver them to the photographed. So I did it and, on my last day in Hoi An,\
  \ I came back to the village, without any camera, with the mission of finding five\
  \ people who had given their images to my lens. And it was one of the most exciting\
  \ experience I\u2019ve already lived.\n\nFirst, I stopped at a grocery store where\
  \ I bought a soft drink and showed the photos to check if the owner could identify\
  \ somebody. All the communication by signals, since the words were just \u201Cblah\
  \ blah blah\u201D. I understood that one of them was her friend by the smile she\
  \ opened and the gesture indicating she would deliver the photo.\n\nAnother woman\
  \ took me to a house, where teenagers were enthused with the photographs of the\
  \ super cute little girl. In the midst of laughter and excitement, I understood\
  \ they asked if I wanted money for the photos and, with the intervention of a teacher,\
  \ who appeared and spoke English, I could confirm they were a gift. She also got\
  \ a picture of another lady to deliver.\n\nOne of the men I was looking for was\
  \ fishing. I left his two portraits with a boy and I hope he understood he should\
  \ give them to the model.\n\nThen I found a gentleman who was working and received\
  \ his photo with great joy. That big smile with crossed over teeth was one of the\
  \ most beautiful I have ever won in my life.\n\nAfter those breathtaking minutes,\
  \ I felt better. The shoots I had taken were not just tourism photos anymore. Each\
  \ one was an individual memory. I felt as giving back some of the soul I had stolen\
  \ while photographing, as some Indians believed."
