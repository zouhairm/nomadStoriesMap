Text: I loved traveling since childhood but all we could go that time,  was at our
  grandparents and aunts houses that was in the other part of the country. My mother
  along with my brother and me had gone to our aunts place. My aunt was working in
  a boarding school in a small hill station. One day my brother and my cousin were
  discussing that they will go out to a near by place which was 15 kms from my aunts
  house. I overheard their discussion and said that I will also go with them, I was
  7 years old that time. The route was not very easy with some trekking so they were
  skeptical but agreed because I was tomboy that time and they thought I can do it.
  Then my younger cousin came, who was 6 years old. When she said that she will also
  come, my brothers confidently said OK if we take permission from my mom. So I went
  inside and came out without asking her and said that she said OK. We all went and
  it was at times very difficult to trek but I was really excited. I was getting really
  tired in between but didn't say it to my elder brothers. My younger sister was taking
  lot of breaks in between and my brothers were getting really annoyed. At one place
  she slipped from the hill and my brother caught her. We left at 11 am and came back
  at 6:30 pm. All the elders in the house were really worried when we came back. Everybody
  started scolding us. After telling our story we apologized. But in the end I was
  really happy that after all those thrills and scolding, we were able to do it and
  everybody is safe. Even today I feel that this decision pushed me to the edge at
  that time.
