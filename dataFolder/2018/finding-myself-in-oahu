Text: "Travelling to Hawaii has always been a dream of mine. For some people, its\
  \ Paris or Tokyo but for me Hawaii was paradise. It may seem unrealistic for a normal,\
  \ working-class girl from Belfast, to travel 7,000 miles to an isolated archipelago\
  \ in the middle of the Pacific Ocean on the other side of the globe. But I did.\
  \ \nWhen I arrived in Oahu in May 2017, I knew it was not going to be like any trip\
  \ I\u2019d ever been on before. The atmosphere was exotic and electric, whether\
  \ it was eating fish tacos from a food truck at Sunset Beach, getting my first tattoo\
  \ from Old Ironside in Chinatown, Honolulu, exploring the Jurassic Park trail at\
  \ Kualoa Ranch, meditating at the Byodo-In Temple or learning traditional Hawaiian\
  \ dancing and drinking Mai Tai\u2019s at a beach front Lau au, everything in Hawaii\
  \ was inspiring to me. I couldn't get enough.\n\nHawaii is not the place for a mundane\
  \ beach holiday, I couldn\u2019t merely sit idly by the Ocean, baking in the sun\
  \ with a glossy magazine. I wanted to, no I needed to explore the island and soak\
  \ in as much of it as I could. One day in 40 degrees heat I scaled the 232m Diamond\
  \ Head, a volcanic, tuff cone that dominates the coastline on Waikiki Beach, this\
  \ not only pushed me to the edge physically but spiritually too. It was breath taking,\
  \ the scenic panoramic views of Oahu and beyond were humbling and exhilarating.\
  \ I needed to see more. \n\nI travelled outside Honolulu to the North Shore and\
  \ stumbled upon the quaint town of Haleiwa, a haven for surfers and home of one\
  \ of the best burgers in Oahu, Teddy\u2019s Bigger Burgers, right next to the world-famous\
  \ Matsumoto shave ice. It was here, that I pushed myself to the edge, like never\
  \ before. Nestled in a secluded harbour in Haleiwa Town was the company, North Shore\
  \ Shark Adventures. I climbed aboard a little boat, emblazoned with shark stickers,\
  \ surrounded by other adrenaline junkies from the USA, Japan and Australia. As I\
  \ plunged into a cage in the Pacific Ocean, five miles from the coast, into the\
  \ most crystal-clear water, surrounded by dozens of ten feet long, Galapagos Sharks,\
  \ I thought to myself, if this is living on the edge, I like it. \n\nI experienced\
  \ so many firsts in Hawaii, from trying ahi-ahi tuna, getting tattooed, hiking a\
  \ volcano to swimming with wild, green sea turtles. Hawaii opened my mind and pushed\
  \ me out of my comfort zone to try new experiences, meet new people and live my\
  \ life to the fullest. I can't wait to see the rest of the world and what it can\
  \ teach me about myself."
