Text: "Why Vitoria? It\xB4s boring and right now too dangerous! The police is on strike,\
  \ in just 4 days there have been more than 70 homicides- insisted Leo convincing\
  \ me not to go to that un-heard city in Brazil.\nIt\u2019s a gut feeling- I assured\
  \ him. But maybe he was right, maybe it was a crazy idea. \nA week before my trip,\
  \ I was about to cancel when it came to me like if it would\u2019ve been a revelation:\
  \ I\u2019m not going on vacation, I\u2019m volunteering to help others. If everything\
  \ was perfect, what would be the point of doing a social project?... I looked once\
  \ more out the window of the bus, to feel the refreshing breeze -the heat inside\
  \ was intense; the view of the blue-green sea dissipated just like those thoughts\
  \ of fear and uncertainty and as the waves gently collided with each other to become\
  \ one, my memories were now a reality, I was at the right place.\nMy mind came back\
  \ to place: I was standing in the aisle, it was pretty crowded, as usual; we were\
  \ crossing the bridge that connected the city with another. I looked at Fernanda,\
  \ my project manager; we were so different in many ways, she was shorter, darker\
  \ skin, more robust outgoing and social than I.\nStill I couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ how the police whose priority to protect the citizens go on strike and leave the\
  \ city to chaos? It made me feel impotent, maybe she had a better knowledge of the\
  \ situation.\nThat was one way to look at it but from another perspective they had\
  \ the same salary for 7 years and needed a raise. She explained that even doctors\
  \ would go on strike sometimes, leaving people without any attention and just some\
  \ days ago a bus was burnt by the driver and passengers.\nIt\u2019s hard to justify\
  \ those actions but these events had something in common: people working extra hours\
  \ for a low salary that wasn\u2019t enough for a better life. I could understand\
  \ the frustration, my country Mexico, was in a similar situation in which society\
  \ is tired of not being heard by the government, meanwhile they get richer by doing\
  \ nothing.\nWe were more alike than I imagined. Our countries suffer from corruption,\
  \ poverty, violence, insecurity, poor education. Not all is bad, Mexico and Brazil\
  \ are rich in culture, traditions, landscapes and much more. We are friendly, sociable,\
  \ helpful, we have so much love for our countries and a huge desire to make even\
  \ a small change in our world.\nThis was one of the Project\xB4s main goals: generate\
  \ conscious in others and ourselves. And yes! Despite the risks Vitoria was the\
  \ best decision I could\xB4ve made."
