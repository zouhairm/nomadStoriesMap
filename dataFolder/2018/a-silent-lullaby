Text: "My breath was short and anxious. I could sense every single muscle of my body\
  \ tensing, the pressure building up, the sweat dripping out of every pore. Her honey\
  \ colored eyes drilled right through me. She looked old, tired, and yet still, I\
  \ was terrified. I was shaking. I could not look down. I risked not seeing death\
  \ crawl upon me. \n\nThe sun glowed over us, bathing the earth with the last lights\
  \ of the day, just as a mother would caress her child. Zebras and Antelopes now\
  \ gazed in peace. As if fauna and flora had written the perfect chant, the soft\
  \ melodies of the night started to play, whilst peace swept silently across the\
  \ savannah. The sound traveled as a silently performed lullaby and did not cease\
  \ as it enveloped the tranquil lioness and my terrified self. \n\nMy blood was pulsating\
  \ through my body and I could hear it in my ears, rapidly circulating at a galloping\
  \ pace. I was paralyzed. And then, I heard it. Muffled at first, and then distinctively\
  \ as the blood rushed back to my limbs. David looked at me, and his chuckles turned\
  \ into a growl. One that came from deep within, as if he was part of the landscape,\
  \ a movement of this elaborated musical piece. The lioness raised her head, as she\
  \ graciously backed away.\n\nI collapsed. \n\nThe nightly sounds of fighting hyenas\
  \ over carcasses in the distance and a familiar scent of burning wood in the campfire\
  \ made me slowly open my eyes. The last thing I had expected had come true. I could\
  \ still feel my heart beating. I let my sight wander carelessly about the tent,\
  \ to find David sitting across the bed. \n\nHesitantly, I cleared my throat: \u201C\
  Why did she leave? Why didn\u2019t you use your spear?\u201D\n\n\u201CWell, why\
  \ should she have taken your life, if she was not hungry? Why would I take her life,\
  \ simply to protect you from your foolishness? You are very lucky, that she was\
  \ not with cubs\u201D. The Maasai seemed amused by my bewilderment. \u201CYou see,\
  \ it is not a matter of life or death, nor them or us. Not of the animal and the\
  \ human. We simply learn to respect the other, we share our home with one another\u201D\
  \ \n\nJust then, the sun began to glow, humming the savanna back to life. There\
  \ was not a sound of roaring engines or clicking cameras. Nor of tourists pressing\
  \ their faces against car glasses, to observe the cheetah as it silently went for\
  \ its prey. The zebras gazed, just as lions fought over their morning catch. \n\n\
  He left my tent and a peaceful lullaby played in my head as I drifted back to sleep."
