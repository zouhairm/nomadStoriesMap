Text: "Still stunned from my sleep, I opened the window curtains of my room, lost\
  \ in the middle of that huge cruise, and without further ado I looked closer, with\
  \ staring eyes, to that amazed natural beauty.  In a blink of an eye, I dressed\
  \ up, full of adrenaline, and I ran to the top of that heavy luxurious ship, having\
  \ to climb many stairs because the craving of breathing fresh air and observing\
  \ those long waterfalls did not allow me to wait for an elevator. \u201CWe are getting\
  \ closer\u2026\u201D I though and I puffed. \n\nSomehow I was right when I felt\
  \ that I should not waste time but only admire all that fresh nature. I reached\
  \ the top of the ship, next to a huge chimney, and from there I could see those\
  \ water veils being born in the middle of tall green valleys, full of life. The\
  \ water was clear and gentle. It was getting down through the grey rocks, touching\
  \ softly the Antarctic Ocean. I couldn\u2019t wait to touch the ground, the real\
  \ land. \n\nAs soon as I left the cruise, I knew something was about to change.\
  \ Although I was surrounded by many people, I was feeling I was alone in my own\
  \ world but I didn't feel loneliness. Instead I felt like I had everything I needed\
  \ within myself. \nI walked through unbelievable steep paths of immense diversity\
  \ and even when I was feeling a burning in my legs, I did not want to stop. I couldn\u2019\
  t resist taking a picture of every single corner full of wild vegetation or the\
  \ beauty of the contrast between the black mountains and the clear blue of the sea,\
  \ to take home some physical memories of a discovery time. \n\nIt was getting late\
  \ and without expecting it, the best was just about to happen. Back to the houseboat,\
  \ and some time after it started moving on its way, I looked to the horizon, trying\
  \ to say a silent goodbye to paradise. Those short hours, lost in the middle of\
  \ Mother Nature, made me feel something I\u2019ve never felt before, some kind of\
  \ magical peace. It happens when the happiness of your heart overflows your body\
  \ because you can't handle masterful energy without feeling in peace with yourself\
  \ first. Suddenly, half of the sky turned black while the other half dazzled the\
  \ faded colors that stretched to the end of the visible sky. It was the midnight\
  \ sun. \u201CSo, this is what heaven feels like\u201D, I thought.  \n\nLife is precious\
  \ when it comes to meaningful feelings you can feel for being alive but nothing\
  \ goes far beyond the feeling you have whenever you admire the power and amazing\
  \ beauty of the earth. And this is the last thing I expected."
