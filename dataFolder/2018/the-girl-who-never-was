Text: "Belfast, Berlin and Hebron, all cities with walls dividing them, have one thing\
  \ in common - their divisions run deeper than the foundations of those walls. In\
  \ Hebron though, the conflict is so palpable that a mere 3-feet high wall on Shuhuda\
  \ Street does the trick. \n\nOn one side of the wall is the Tomb of the Patriarchs,\
  \ a holy site for the Jews. On the other is Abrahami Mosque, Muslims\u2019 place\
  \ of worship. \nOn one side are moneyed Jews, donning black. On the other are poorer\
  \ Palestinians, hijab-covered. \nOn one side are young Israeli soldiers with loaded\
  \ guns. On the other are young Palestinians armed with stones. \n\nI wondered if\
  \ Jews and Muslims ever acknowledge each other when they walk by the wall? The dividing\
  \ wall isn't tall enough to hide each other's faces. Perhaps the wall is tauntingly\
  \ short to remind both communities of the 'other' they shouldn't connect with. \n\
  \nI spent a few hours walking by the wall on the deserted Shuhuda Street. Avner,\
  \ my guide, explained that the Street was once the main street of Hebron. Now it\
  \ looked colourless, almost lifeless. All I saw was the brown of the dry sandy wind\
  \ that blew into my eyes and the grey concrete of the streets. Except for a living,\
  \ breathing Israeli soldier toting a gun in his hand, the only other sign of life\
  \ was the hateful graffiti splattered on the walls and on shuttered shops.\n\nSince\
  \ I walked on the Israel-controlled sector of the divided city, I was not allowed\
  \ to interact with the Palestinians.  \n\nFrom the door of a house on the Palestinian\
  \ side - a few feet away from of the wall - a girl, not older than five years, came\
  \ running towards me. The big camera I held, possibly,  interested her. Dressed\
  \ in a purple jumpsuit, her undone hair carelessly fell over her shoulders. While\
  \ still close to her door, she donned a sweet smile. But as she approached the wall\
  \ her smile progressively faded and confusion clouded her eyes. Placing her small\
  \ palms on the wall, which was almost her height, she tried to reach me. That little\
  \ Palestinian girl was the local connection I could never make, but I so desperately\
  \ wanted to.\n\nLater that day, it occurred to me that while the child was still\
  \ relatively further away from me, she could see me. As she came closer to the wall,\
  \ I became less visible to her, explaining the sadness in her eyes. What she didn't\
  \ see was the deep sadness in mine. \n\nFrom an early age, children of Hebron are\
  \ introduced to segregation. The dwarfed wall expertly makes the conflict permanent."
