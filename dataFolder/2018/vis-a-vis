Text: "1942\nThe earth rocked and groaned on bombardment. With each crunch of rubble\
  \ meeting chunks of metal debris, bones rattled and shook in fear, horror. The ack-ack\
  \ roared, spitting bullets from the slope above their half-dug trenches. The scene\
  \ exuded chaos in every direction. The tropical night sky, sable black, was full\
  \ of variegated fireworks and thick plumes of smoke. Streaks of smoldering vermillion\
  \ and ochre ignited the blank canvas. \nThey lay curled in the ditches, filled with\
  \ dry soil, dust and scrub. Echoes of hurried screams crept their way down the sparse,\
  \ rock-strewn hill from head-camp. Bruce lay still, awaiting further instructions;\
  \ awaiting his imminent death.  \nThey were well and truly sitting ducks; both to\
  \ the bombers and the hordes of mosquitos no doubt carrying malaria and dengue.\
  \ The half-dug trenches, a necessity for decreasing vulnerability, were a dog\u2019\
  s breakfast. This was obviously due to the fact they were dug with empty cans after\
  \ meals. This pubescent soldier wasn\u2019t the only one with little hope. The humid\
  \ night air pressed down upon them; tasting of salt, burnt rubber, fear.\n\n2012\n\
  I consciously appreciate my final morning of the balmy air. The breeze a warm breath\
  \ on the back of my neck. The mud bubbles between my toes with every step I take.\
  \ Atop the peak I look deep into this panoramic masterpiece. I see lights of Port\
  \ Moresby in the distance slowly going off as the sun rises over the coastal city.\
  \ This trip has woken me up from the ignorance I arrived with. I reflect on everything\
  \ back home and realize I have never been so appreciative of the small things. The\
  \ car rides with Mum on the way to school. My friends coming over for sleepovers.\
  \ The comfort of my bedroom. I want to find my own purpose and live a life like\
  \ these soldiers did. A life of pride, honor and success. Men out here sacrificed\
  \ everything. The only thing I have bled out here is privilege. \nThe terrain of\
  \ this old battlefield, our final campsite, was riddled of loose gravel mixed with\
  \ putrid mud, making the ground as slippery as ice. I can only imagine how hard\
  \ living here would have been for those brave men. Before I start the descent I\
  \ stop to read the large archway memorial constructed over the top of the trailhead.\

  \ Campaign.\n1925-1942\"\n\nAs a tear rolls down my face I knew it was time to go\
  \ home."
