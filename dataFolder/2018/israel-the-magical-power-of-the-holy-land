Text: "As we arrived Israel, the heat literally overwhelmed us after leaving the airport.\
  \ Unaware of what was yet to come and yet full of expectations, I looked out of\
  \ the window of the bus that was to take us to Bethlehem. \"House of Bread\", an\
  \ unusual name but I should realize soon that this name fits like a glove. \nAlready\
  \ the impressions of the day opened my eyes, before this quite miraculous night\
  \ managed to grab me completely as this magical land entirely enchanted me. Walking\
  \ across bare facades, the long, narrow, and hot streets of Bethlehem, I perceived\
  \ the scent of different spices and freshly cooked Arab coffee. By regarding the\
  \ bright colors of the silk shawls, the silver jewelery shining in the sunlight\
  \ and hospitality, I felt that there was more than one could ever imagine. And when\
  \ the evening came I encountered the person who was to change my life. A balmy night,\
  \ whose sensations I will never forget. Conversations about conversations, hookah\
  \ and Canadian whiskey with maple syrup: the last thing I expected in Israel. But\
  \ the journey should only begin here. He maintained a project with Palestinian families\
  \ and that night, I met one of them. We were strolling through the empty streets\
  \ of Bethlehem, where now and then an armed Israeli soldier was standing in the\
  \ corner, watching us with prying eyes, down to a small alleyway with a little,\
  \ bedraggled house that we moved towards to. A family of 15 people lived there but\
  \ the building seemed downright minimalist and yet, everyone was truly happy. So,what\
  \ does it take to be happy? After that night,the answer seemed clear: Being happy\
  \ means, having people around you, who will catch you if you fall. Materialistic\
  \ ownership seems trivial in view of this, as the people with whom one can share\
  \ much more (than just money) are the most important. We talked for a long time,\
  \ into late hours and as we left, the air was filled with the lovely smell of freshly\
  \ baked bread. Bethlehem, \"house of bread\", you have captured and enchanted me\
  \ as you showed to me what it means to be a human. Travelling connects people, it\
  \ opens ones eyes and shows again and again how small the world is, how equal every\
  \ human is at heart and that cultural, religious and political barriers seem surmountable\
  \ in interpersonal contacts. That spark, which ignited itself as we watched the\
  \ stars over Bethlehem sitting on the roof again after this miraculous encounter,\
  \ continued until the muezzin awoke us the next morning with his lovely Arabic song."
