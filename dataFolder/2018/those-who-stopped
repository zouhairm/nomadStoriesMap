Text: "We were standing on the corner of the main road in a desolate town located\
  \ in a forgotten part of the country. 'How did we get stuck here?' I thought to\
  \ myself. It was the afternoon but hardly a soul could be seen on the street. A\
  \ random dog trotted over to us and sniffed around our packs. I heard a familiar\
  \ sound, turned, and saw a small boy dribbling a worn-out basketball down the opposite\
  \ sidewalk. A lone car or truck would pass by every few minutes. Each time was the\
  \ same routine: Bret and I leapt to our feet, smiled wide, and stuck out our thumbs\
  \ in the guiltless plea for a free ride. No one stopped.\nEventually a rickety sedan\
  \ pulled over next to us. Toilet paper and wrinkled clothing were visible through\
  \ the rear window. A man with a great beard leaned over the passenger seat and asked\
  \ if we wanted a ride to the dollar store, smiling genuinely and pointing up the\
  \ road. The dollar store was a quarter mile away. \"No thanks,\" we said, grinning.\
  \ We laughed about it afterward, but I admired the man for some reason. He had very\
  \ little, but was the first person willing to offer help, even if that help was\
  \ insignificant. \nAnother 15 minutes passed before a dark blue minivan pulled aside.\
  \ A man and woman stepped out, walked to the trunk, and began rearranging their\
  \ belongings to make room for our packs. They were a French couple touring the US.\
  \ We drove through a few small towns and then into a forest where the trees were\
  \ all barren and charred from a recent fire. The couple dropped us off at an unmanned\
  \ information booth that we suspected would be close to our destination. We were\
  \ wrong.\nThe sun was beginning to set and there were hardly any cars on this stretch\
  \ of road. Bret and I resigned ourselves to camping out near the woods. But just\
  \ when all hope was lost, a silver minivan passed us and turned onto the shoulder.\
  \ The occupants were a mother and daughter, returning from a short vacation. \"\
  You know, we weren't gonna stop for you two, but then I thought that my son is the\
  \ kind foolish enough to hitchhike like this, and I would hope someone'd stop for\
  \ him,\" said the mother. \nExcitement. The sun was dipping below the horizon when\
  \ we finally arrived at a small gravel parking lot. Bret and I said thanks and departed,\
  \ walking a little farther to the edge of a great expanse. As the sun cast its last\
  \ rays, I looked out over the Grand Canyon for the first time. And I thought about\
  \ those people, the ones we never expected, who went out of their way to get us\
  \ here."
