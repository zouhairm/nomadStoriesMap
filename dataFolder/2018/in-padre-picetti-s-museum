Text: "Padre Juan Bautista Picetti showed me into his office, a tight, dusty space\
  \ within the Seminario Conciliar San Lu\xEDs. Equation-covered whiteboards took\
  \ up most of the walls; the rest bore posters of Pope Francis and the Sacred Heart\
  \ of Jesus. \nPicetti has taught science at this Catholic school in La Serena, Chile\
  \ since the 1950s. Physics and chemistry, he told me, meshed with the spiritual\
  \ realm he pondered as a priest. \n\u201CYou can\u2019t talk about God without knowing\
  \ all of this world,\u201D he said.\nPicetti\u2019s zeal had impressed the American\
  \ astronomers who arrived in the 1960s to study Chile\u2019s crystalline night skies.\
  \ \nI was interviewing some of them in La Serena, 300 miles north of Santiago. When\
  \ I asked Dr. Chris Smith, Head of Mission for the Association of Universities for\
  \ Research in Astronomy (AURA), how they had helped their host country, he brought\
  \ up the group\u2019s partnership with this elderly educator.  \n\u201CThis Padre\
  \ is an amazing teacher of science,\u201D he said.  \u201CHe teaches very hands-on.\
  \ And just as a concrete metric...out of this small school in regional Chile, five\
  \ PhD\u2019s in astronomy have come.\u201D\nI called the school and met Picetti\
  \ the next day. \u201CThe restlessness inside me was always to do science,\u201D\
  \ he recalled, in soft, Genoese-accented Spanish. He brought this interest from\
  \ his native Italy to this teaching post by the Pacific. Here, \u201CI pass my restlessness\
  \ on to the kids.\u201D \nHe showed me how in his \u201Cmuseum:\u201D two rooms\
  \ filled with dioramas and machinery. With some support from AURA, Picetti had built\
  \ and maintained this collection to show his students Newton\u2019s and Einstein\u2019\
  s theories. After six decades, his ardor for these principles still burned bright.\
  \ \n\u201CBoom!\u201D he exclaimed, pointing to a lens that focused sunlight onto\
  \ a tiny cannon\u2019s fuse. Later, he switched on a self-built machine that projected\
  \ graphite atoms onto a phosphorescent screen. \u201CLook at the symmetry,\u201D\
  \ he whispered, pointing at the pulsating honeycomb pattern. \u201CIt\u2019s beautiful.\u201D\
  \nOn his desk sat a shard-shaped glass plaque engraved with his name. AURA created\
  \ the Padre Picetti Prize in 2014 to honor Chilean science teachers. Picetti was\
  \ its first recipient. \nThis might seem a fitting cap to his career. But as we\
  \ spoke that day in September 2015, the teacher kept bringing up the future: his\
  \ students, that afternoon\u2019s class, and his hopes for a new teaching observatory,\
  \ built outside the city\u2019s lights, \u201Cso that little kids can come...and\
  \ see a bit of the Universe.\u201D"
