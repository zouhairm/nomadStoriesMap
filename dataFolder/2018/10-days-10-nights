Text: "I had the strong feeling that I should visit a warmer place saying goodbye\
  \ to the mountains. The Spanish magic has always triggered me but I was waiting\
  \ for the last push. It came and we were booking the tickets. I always wanted to\
  \ try out, how is to travel without a plan, without organizing appropriately. \n\
  With my friend, Agnes, we choose to find a place to sleep with couchsurfing. She\
  \ had already been an advanced couch-surfer. Of course, we found nobody who would\
  \ host us for 10 days. We decided we move as much as necessary. During these 10\
  \ days, we slept in 6 different places. From the airport we were hitchhiking to\
  \ the city. A pitiful driver took us and showed also hospitality offering a place\
  \ to sleep for one night.  First day \u2013 accomplished. Amazing host, food, everything.\
  \ For the next night we received an invitation from the above-mentioned site. 2nd\
  \ night \u2013 accomplished. In fact, not really, because we barely slept. Our host\
  \ forgot to mention, that his house is already full and that we share a tiny space\
  \ with his snoring, mostly male Indian family. In the end, nothing dramatic happened,\
  \ but we didn't accept any alcohol, and we slept in our clothes on the floor. In\
  \ the next morning, we were running fast from that ambiance. 2 nights, hostel. We\
  \ were in a room with 20 beds but I had my earplugs and a safe bed. The receptionists\
  \ were Hungarians. Getting better. 2 nights, couchsurfing in Barcelona\u2019s luxury\
  \ zone. View to the yachts and to the sea. 2 young gentry offered their couch. Their\
  \ life was about traveling, money, and consumption. The conversations and the walking\
  \ were nice. Fancy life. 3 nights in the countryside. We found a beautiful farm\
  \ with workaway.com. We were cleaning, cooking, cutting bamboos and collecting wood\
  \ in exchange for food and accommodation. The big house is built of stones, there\
  \ is a small swimming pool and Rosa, the cleaning manager assistant (to be PC).\
  \ I felt like in a soap opera. \nLast night at the airport. No sleeping, expensive\
  \ coffee.\nBarcelona: the architecture of the Catalan modernism has absolutely seduced\
  \ me. It is clever, brilliant, magical. The sea, the music, the atmosphere. The\
  \ small streets. I have to confess, I was in love. \nThanks to not planning, we\
  \ have seen the slums, the luxury part, the middle-class apartment-magic, the crowded\
  \ hostels dedicated to poor tourists, the countryside and Rosa, the cleaning manager.\
  \ We were exploring the city and more with our 10-days clothes- and survival kit.\
  \ Hero's journey."
