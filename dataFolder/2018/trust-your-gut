Text: "I had been sitting on an almost empty bus with 5 strangers for almost 4 hours\
  \ on the highway, and waiting for the moment when I finally get a glimpse of the\
  \ huge bamboo forests I've been dreaming to see all of my life. The bus finally\
  \ took an exit and stopped in an unknown city. The driver turned back to me and\
  \ pointed at a car. I knew what he meant. I had to take off the bus and get into\
  \ that car.\n\nAfter the first shock, I realised that I didn't have much choice.\
  \ Apart from some basic knowledge, I didn't speak a word of their language, so it\
  \ would have been another challenge to seek for help. So I hopped off the bus and\
  \ watched it merging with the long noisy serpents of vehicles which were non-stop\
  \ sounding their horns expressing their feelings towards fellow motorists. They\
  \ say, in Sichuan not only the food is spicy but the people, too.\n\nAs I was standing\
  \ there completely lost, the backdoor of the car opened. A relatively huge shape\
  \ of a Western looking figure squeezed out himself of the vehicle and quickly ran\
  \ to the front to give a bone-breaking hug to the fragile Chinese man who just got\
  \ out of the driver's seat. This was the point when all my worries were gone and\
  \ deep down inside I truly believed that nothing wrong was going to happen to me.\
  \ Li politely took my backpack and soon there were no concrete buildings or ugly,\
  \ polluted industrial sites around me anymore, only the lush greens and neverending\
  \ rows of 120 square kilometres of bamboo. \n\nLi stopped the car next to a fairytale\
  \ lake with some slowly moving bamboo rafts peacefully swaying in the water. He\
  \ started typing on his phone then turned to me pushing the screen into my face.\
  \ Finally, we managed to get into a conversation, thanks to the translator apps.\
  \ As I was unable to book any accommodation, he recommended a family owned guesthouse.\n\
  \n\"Clean, good air. Good food.\" - he promised.\n\nWith a genuine kindness in his\
  \ eyes, he was the type of human you instinctively trust, so the recommendation\
  \ had been accepted. I didn't only get a fantastic room in the middle of Shu Nan\
  \ Zhu Hai, the Southern Sichuan Bamboo Sea but also a local tourguide for the rest\
  \ of my stay.\n\nWasn't it worth trusting my gut and getting into that car in the\
  \ city which I still don't know the name of?"
