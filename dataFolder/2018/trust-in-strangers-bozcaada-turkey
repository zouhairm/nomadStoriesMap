Text: "It had been so hot the past few days in Turkey, that I could barely manage\
  \ to leave my hotel room in the city of \xC7anakkale. After suffering through the\
  \ heat for what felt like forever, I took the ferry to Bozcaada, a former Greek\
  \ island. When I finally arrived at the island's best beach I stopped to buy a bottle\
  \ of water. It turned out that the owner was an English speaking man who had just\
  \ moved from Istanbul to open a small beach bar.\n\u201CYou\u2019re from Australia,\
  \ right?\u201D I snickered at this Turkish man's poor read on my accent.\n\n\u201C\
  Not even close! I\u2019m from New York,\u201D I corrected him. When I returned to\
  \ the bar after my swim, I started speaking with him again. He told me that he left\
  \ the city for the quiet island life to open the small beach bar. \n\n\u201CI can\u2019\
  t believe that you\u2019re traveling alone as a girl here in Turkey,\u201D he said\
  \ to me. Yeah, I get that a lot.\n\n\u201CI see no reason to be afraid of the world.\
  \ What makes traveling my own country, where there is just as much hatred and violence,\
  \ any safer?\" He realized that I had a point.\n\n\u201CIf you\u2019d like I can\
  \ drive you back to town and we can get dinner. Only if you want.\u201D\n\nThose\
  \ who have not traveled a lot would probably tell me that this was a horrible idea.\
  \ But in my eyes, life is an adventure and you must take all of the opportunities\
  \ given to you. It's also about having good judgement; it's about knowing when somebody\
  \ has good intentions and when they have bad ones. Sometimes my intuition fails\
  \ me, but this evening it did not. I\u2019ve had my fair share of being picked up\
  \ by men who had the intention of getting laid, but I could tell that this man was\
  \ being genuine. \n\n\u201CDo you want a tour of the island?\u201D \n\nDid I? Hell\
  \ yeah. \n\nWe went to a spot above a cliff, where you could see a wrecked ship\
  \ off the coast, thanks to the full moon. I showed him how to use his camera, took\
  \ some shots of my own, found out that he had worked at a summer camp not far from\
  \ my hometown, and had dinner (for free) at his friend's restaurant right on the\
  \ marina. After many years of traveling, I've made an important realization: it\u2019\
  s important to trust your judgement and be careful who you go off with, but also\
  \ not to be afraid of every person you meet. Because in situations like this, trusting\
  \ a stranger resulted in nothing less than an incredible night. It can definitely\
  \ be a bit scary sometimes because as we know, not everybody has good intentions.\
  \ But, when you pick the right people, you\u2019ll end up having unforgettable experiences."
