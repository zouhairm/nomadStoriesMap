Text: "Strangers Though We Were\nBy The Dumb American \n(Mikey Rosenbaum)\n\n\nCypres\
  \ leaned against a tree in the Place Emile. The shade from the tree covered his\
  \ eyes but I knew it was him. Same beat up brown bowler. He dressed the part: slim\
  \ sunglasses, raggedy corduroy jacket. His beard giving him the illusion of age.\n\
  \nI beckoned him over to join me in listening. He declined. \n\nPapi, the redbearded\
  \ street organist, wove his tunes in and out of the Place. Although his sound exuded\
  \ summertime Montmartre, it was inauthentic, at least to Cypres. \u201CA monkey\
  \ could wind a wheel\u2026\u201D\n\nThe tension arose when Papi claimed to play\
  \ at Cypres\u2019 spot everyday for the last thirty years. This was false. He\u2019\
  d arrived a month ago, according to Cypres. \n\nTo a busker, the wind-up organ is\
  \ bagpipesque. It engulfs any attempt at playing (see: making money). You become\
  \ a victim to its sea of sound. Suffice it to say, there was competing sounds. This\
  \ encounter almost ended with Cypres smashing a heated Papi over the head with his\
  \ guitar but Cypres did not want to hurt the guitar.\n\nWe brought beers from the\
  \ \u201Cfamous market in Amelie\u201D down the hill to a park looking over the city,\
  \ strangers though we were. \n\nSurrounded by buildings our heroes struggled in,\
  \ we discussed the status of art in the modern age. Young artists living in Paris\
  \ have to live outside the city where it was more affordable. Paris was forcing\
  \ away what made it so wonderful. Cypres voiced his frustration. \n\n\u201CIs Paris\
  \ still the epicenter for art?\u201D \n\nHe pauses, thinks and says, \u201CForever,\
  \ yes. Probably Berlin is, now, though, but Paris will always be Paris\u2026\u201D\
  \ He trails off, lost in some thought melody.\n\nHe then tells of some opportunity\
  \ to present a symphonic piece somewhere in Norway, maybe? \n\nHe dreamed the melody\
  \ in a unique way. At a mountainside music festival, as he sings the end of his\
  \ song, lightning strikes, knocking the power out. He and the other musicians head\
  \ back to this glass house on the mountainside to stormwatch. In this lightning\
  \ dance, he heard the combination of power, destruction, beauty and wonder. \n\n\
  Inspiration comes from unexpected places. And sometimes not from a place at all.\
  \  Even lightning storms and beers in parks.\n\nThe jam turned out to be the buskers\
  \ I\u2019d seen playing in the streets. This bohemian epicenter I wanted to find\
  \ was already here. I was seeking it in places and things when instead that spirit\
  \ was in the faces and voices of the people I met, of the poets still rhyming in\
  \ the streets."
