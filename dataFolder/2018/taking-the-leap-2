Text: "In the misty morning, we parked the car at the lookout. Leaning against the\
  \ railing, cool condensation soaked into my sleeves as I strained to see what was\
  \ hidden below. Every so often the blanket of white would part, just enough to hint\
  \ at the canyon before us. Everyone told me Christmas in Sydney would be hot. Yet\
  \ here I was, damp and shivering, waiting for my companion to reveal what was in\
  \ store for us today.\nMeeting Clint had been a gift. He and his family had adopted\
  \ me for the holiday season after the two of us had met on a survivalist course.\
  \ They could trace their lineage back to the first ship of convicts sent to Australia.\
  \ The last few days had been a historical tour. Local streets and valleys donned\
  \ Clint\u2019s last name; areas where his forefathers had crosses the Blue Mountains\
  \ after their time had been served. I had put my feet into the river that had watered\
  \ their crops and walked their rugged horse and carriage trail. But today was not\
  \ about history, it was about mystery. In all his exploring, Govett\u2019s Leap\
  \ was one place Clint had never been.\n\u201CWhat\u2019s out there,\u201D I pointed\
  \ into the milky abyss.\n\u201CI can\u2019t tell you.\u201D There was a smile playing\
  \ on his face. \u201CWe will have see.\u201D\nFrankly, I didn\u2019t think we would\
  \ see much of anything. The fog was so thick as we descended I felt like I was sinking\
  \ into a cloud. Slipping my way across the stone, I clung to the handrail. I was\
  \ so busy watching my own feet that I didn\u2019t notice the mist beginning to fade.\
  \ At a turn in the path, I looked up and that\u2019s when it hit me. The veil of\
  \ white had lifted and there was a swath of rainforest as far as the eye could see.\
  \ Sulfur-crested cockatoos swooped across the tree tops and whispers of sun were\
  \ beginning to illuminate this secret world. I had been transported. The walls of\
  \ the canyon were alive with hanging swamps. Tendrils of fern hung and dripped all\
  \ around me. And out across the canyon a waterfall roared, its water pitched out\
  \ over the edge and caught in the wind where it whipped into a froth and mixed with\
  \ the ebbing mist.\nPerched on the lip of a sandstone cliff, the two of us stood\
  \ marveling.\n\u201CThis is incredible.\u201D\n\u201CThis,\u201D he replied, \u201C\
  is only the beginning.\u201D He gestured to a staircase snaking down the canyon.\
  \ It looked treacherous, it looked slick, and it looked a beast to climb back up.\
  \ But now that I had seen her, this mystical forest was calling me in. So with a\
  \ shared smile we started our descent, deep into the jungle you might never have\
  \ known was there."
