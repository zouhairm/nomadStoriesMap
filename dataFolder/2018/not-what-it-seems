Text: "When people think about London, they think about Big Ben, the palace, London\
  \ Eye, and so many different beautiful but turistic places. So of course, when i\
  \ went there for my first time, I was expecting those great buildings to shock my\
  \ mind. If I have to be honest, they were disappointing. Why is that? It's just\
  \ that when I went there, I just couldn't take my eyes and mind of a specific thing:\
  \ i was amazed by the beautiful mix of culture London is buildt with. Around the\
  \ streets you could see so many different people, cultures, and most important:\
  \ stories. Every one had it's own background and memories, and each one of them\
  \ was represented by the looks and attitude that person was having. Nowadays, when\
  \ people ask me if London is worth seeing, I can't stop speaking: The people of\
  \ London have my heart, and the way they accept each other without fighting or criticising\
  \ is so inspiring I want everyone to experience that, because it's a very good example\
  \ to learn from. \nI have a polish friend, she always tells me she felt like that\
  \ when she came to Barcelona, so the big question is: if they are some cities in\
  \ the world that could be considered as the most riches in the world (because the\
  \ knowledge of culture is the most valuous thing humans can have), why aren't there\
  \ more countries, or even cities, that copy that way of living and embrace more\
  \ the diversity? Personally, I think people are scared. They are scared about the\
  \ unknown. They are scared about embracing things that aren't the same. But fear\
  \ is an obstacle that our mind builds, and it's an obstacle that keeps us from leaving,\
  \ because as more as we learn from other people and their stories, the more we grow\
  \ as a person, and I can't wait to show the world the beautiful and unknown cultures\
  \ we have on the earth."
