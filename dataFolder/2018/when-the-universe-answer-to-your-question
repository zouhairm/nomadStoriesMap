Text: "I've always wanted to travel to Southeast Asia, but coming from a very simple\
  \ Brazilian family and having to work since I was 15 years old to pay for my studies,\
  \ I never expected to be able to visit it so early, at the age of 27.\n\nIt was\
  \ December 29th of 2014, the 4th day of a 28 day vacation around the orient, and\
  \ there I was, on the top of Ham Rong mountain in SaPa (Vietnam). \n\nThe blue sky\
  \ filled with white cotton clouds, the tree shadows on the trail and the rice fields\
  \ view made it the perfect spot to sit down and think about life. \n\nBut then,\
  \ in the middle of many gratitude thoughts I started asking myself \"What good things\
  \ have I done for humanity to deserve being here?\u201D, \u201CThere are so many\
  \ people in the world and I am the one having this amazing experience of being on\
  \ the other side of Earth, getting to see beautiful places, and feeling so happy\
  \ and lucky. Why me?\u201D, when suddenly I heard some laughs.\n\nWhen I looked\
  \ behind me I saw 5 Vietnamese girls, who were about their 20s, wearing colorful\
  \ clothes, hats and headbands, one of them had a yellow umbrella as well to protect\
  \ her from the sun. \n\nThey walked towards me and one of them shyly took a breath\
  \ of courage and asked \"Would you mind taking a picture with us? You are so beautiful!\"\
  .\n\nCan you imagine?! I had this tired face and a failed attempt of making a hair\
  \ bun, typical from a girl who had traveled overnight on a train and couldn't wait\
  \ to wash her hair. I was asking myself what the hell I had done to deserve being\
  \ there, and out of the blue, these nicely dressed random girls choose me to take\
  \ a picture with them and give me such a nice compliment! That\u2019s rare.\n\n\
  I could not believe that was happening, I felt so special at that moment that I\
  \ got teardrops at the corner of my eyes and a giant smile appeared on my lips.\
  \ I was the one pleased to take a picture with them, so of course I said yes and\
  \ got that moment captured to myself as well.\n\nSomehow, I believe that it was\
  \ a response from the universe, telling me that we can do good things just by the\
  \ words we say, a smile or hug we give, or even a silent moment at the right time...\
  \ Sometimes we don't realize the power we have to make others feel happy on a daily\
  \ basis.\n\nWhen people ask me why I am so passionate about traveling, moments like\
  \ this come up to my mind. Traveling is not only about visiting stunning places\
  \ and having fun adventures, it is about experiencing feelings that touch us in\
  \ such a way that we feel more alive than ever."
