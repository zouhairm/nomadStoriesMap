Text: "I have a suspicion our helper, Maheshari, thinks I am what is in Sinhalese\
  \ called \u201Cwadakata na\u201D \u2014 useless, good for nothing. She likes me,\
  \ but doesn\u2019t think I am capable of doing things on my own, especially when\
  \ it comes to her domain \u2014 the kitchen.\nHer conviction might have something\
  \ to do with the fact that I am white. It is a widespread stereotype in Sri Lanka\
  \ that western women are not very good with cooking, cleaning, and home keeping\
  \ in general. \nWhen I step onto her territory early in the morning to prepare myself\
  \ an omelet, she takes the frying pan from my hands the way she would take scissors\
  \ from a two-year-old. She smiles broadly, puts her palm on her chest and says,\
  \ \u201CMama hadanawa!\u201D \u2014 \u201CI will make!\u201D\nMaheshari spent almost\
  \ all of her adult life working as a helper after dropping out of school. At eighteen,\
  \ she got married. At twenty seven, she left for Jordan to work as a housemaid,\
  \ leaving behind two children. Two years in Jordan were followed by two years in\
  \ Saudi Arabia, and four and a half years in Kuwait with short trips home in between\
  \ to see family. \nHundreds of thousands of Sri Lankan women travel to the Middle\
  \ East every year to work as housemaids and support their families back home. Apart\
  \ from being away from the loved ones, they often suffer physical abuse from their\
  \ employers. Maheshari was lucky to work in good caring families in all three countries,\
  \ as much as you can use the term \u201Clucky\u201D towards a woman who couldn\u2019\
  t see her children grow up for years at a stretch. \nSince we don\u2019t speak the\
  \ same language, our communication is largely based on gestures and interjections.\
  \ That one time when Maheshari allowed me into the kitchen to make cookies, I fell\
  \ short of her already low expectations by not being able to switch on a blender.\
  \ Maheshari took the blender from me hastily. \u201CAh?\u201D she looked at me as\
  \ if to say: \u201CYou see, baby?\u201D She masterfully twisted it into place with\
  \ a longer and more drawling: \u201CAaaah\u2026\u201D Then switched on the button\
  \ and finished her \u201Cblender for dummies\u201D tutorial with a short and excited:\
  \ \u201CAh!\u201D \nMaybe it\u2019s not me being foreign or white that makes her\
  \ treat me this way, I thought then. After so many years of working abroad, she\
  \ is used to care for families that are not her own, to raise and teach children\
  \ born to other women. That is what she does naturally. Even if a child happens\
  \ to be an almost thirty-year-old Russian woman."
