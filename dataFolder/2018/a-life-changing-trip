Text: "The sun was hiding, creating a beautiful goldish pink landscape behind the\
  \ ginger hair of my friend in front of me. Although I was trying hard to pay attention\
  \ to her, I couldn\u2019t ignore the colours forming behind her. They\u2019ve always\
  \ made me feel emotions that no one has ever made me experience before. But, right\
  \ before my friend started yelling at me, I looked at her with the biggest smile\
  \ I could make. A strong feeling of warmth and joy was rising inside me.\n\n\u2014\
  Have you heard me? I\u2019ve just told you we\u2019re going to Norway! -she shouted.\n\
  \nMy friend and I had applied to a Norwegian university a few months ago, and now,\
  \ our dream had become true. I already knew the good news, but seeing her eyes shine\
  \ like she was about to cry from joy made me feel as if it was the first time I\u2019\
  ve heard those words.\n\nThat was the last thing I remember from that day. Time\
  \ has passed by at an incredible speed, and now we\u2019ve been in Norway for two\
  \ months. We are living in a small town called Moskenes, a fishermen\u2019s town.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ve been living the best days of my life. I\u2019ve met magic people,\
  \ young people with minds full of dreams, and old people with wise wrinkles around\
  \ their eyes. I feel like now, I know the world, but I\u2019m aware that I have\
  \ a lot more left to discover.\n\nHowever, and even if this experience has been\
  \ the last thing I expected for myself; today I cannot help feeling down. That\u2019\
  s the reason why I decided to take a long walk near the sea, and now tears are rolling\
  \ down my face, creating a salty flavour in my mouth.  It is night now, but the\
  \ sky isn\u2019t dark. There are thousand of stars above myself, shining strong.\
  \ The northern lights seem to dance in the sky, reflecting in the water. Even though\
  \ the dance in the sky is majestic and gentle, the water transforms everything into\
  \ a chaotic dance of stressed lights. The colours are green and yellow, but I could\
  \ have promised right there that they\u2019ve always belong in the blue sky. My\
  \ heart was full again, but my breath was taken away with the lights. The sky is\
  \ a beautiful metaphor of my life right now, of the life of all the travellers that\
  \ find a reason to go on by looking at a landscape: Light and dark, combined in\
  \ one for a moment, alone. \n\nLife\u2019s great. That\u2019s all I can tell you\
  \ right now. I don\u2019t know how it\u2019s going to be tomorrow, or next month,\
  \ but I know what I feel right know, and I know I\u2019m seeing life at one of its\
  \ best forms, and, right now, that\u2019s enough for me. I hope it\u2019s enough\
  \ for you too."
