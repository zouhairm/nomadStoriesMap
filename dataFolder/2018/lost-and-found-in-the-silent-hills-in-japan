Text: "Something was out of joint. Perhaps it was true what they say about your Japaniversary\
  \ \u2013 there's a fracture in time and nothing's new anymore, but nothing's old\
  \ either. The problem was either me or Tokyo, or both of us. It was February, a\
  \ false promise of spring and I went to visit Shizuoka without expectations.\nOur\
  \ host was Sohaku-san, a Buddhist priest. He told us that Mount Fuji was hiding\
  \ in the clouds, \u201Cit\u2019s a pity you cannot see, zannen\u201D he says, his\
  \ speaking peppered with Japanese. He had a full day of activities planned. We made\
  \ green tea, practiced zen-meditation, and after that, Sohaku took us to a Shinto\
  \ temple, his earthy tone robes in contrast to the white and blue of the Shinto\
  \ priest. In front of the temple, a big cherry tree, awash with pink, before the\
  \ blossoming time of cherries. It wasn\u2019t my first time to a Shinto shrine,\
  \ but it felt like it was, as the priests talked to us and performed ceremonial\
  \ dances. For dinner we followed Sohaku through a loud pachinko parlor and into\
  \ a hidden elevator to the top floor. We took off our shoes and went to our table.\
  \ There is something intimate about taking off your shoes that makes a public place\
  \ instantly feel private. Shoes on and you're a customer, shoes off and you're a\
  \ guest. A woman and a child were waiting. They came to meet us and the girl wanted\
  \ us to sign her scrapbook. In her way she was trying to break a culture wall. \n\
  There is this notion that the bigger the city the more diversity and acceptance\
  \ of others, but here in this small town we were talked to more sincerely than ever\
  \ during our life in Tokyo. Tokyo shop clerks were afraid to look you in the eye,\
  \ but Shizuoka people went out of their way to meet us. As I went to sleep I realized\
  \ that today I was a friend to this people, a fellow human. \nNext morning, after\
  \ eating Buddhist breakfast in the temple, we got on the bus to Tokyo. Sohaku was\
  \ waving until we lost him out of sight. The sky was clear and tall and there seemed\
  \ to be so much space to breathe. We saw Mount Fuji, finally deciding to show itself.\
  \ And I felt \u2013 different. Something weird, something dislocated came back in\
  \ place. I felt like a year before and I remembered why I love Japan. And Japan\
  \ loved me back. Shizuoka is written with the characters for 'silence' and 'hill'\
  \ and it made me climb hills in myself and see in silence. People  climb Mount Fuji\
  \ to find strength or meaning. I only needed to reach its foot. And go back to Tokyo\
  \ with a heart fresh like a blank page, only the cursor there, blinking."
