Text: "Careening off the edge of a poorly maintained mountain road, sideways, in a\
  \ battered old bus. Being held up by youths packing homemade pipe guns for a bit\
  \ of cash and a smartphone. Winning a postcode lottery despite not having a legal\
  \ address in the country. These are all things that, I thought, had more chance\
  \ of happening than what actually happened to me whilst travelling in Peru.\n\n\
  Being twenty-eight years old and well past my formative years, I was under the foolish\
  \ impression that I'd survived the phase of my life where holiday mishaps would\
  \ occur. The type of situations that arise through the folly of youth combined with\
  \ the buzz of excitement you get when you manage to flee your 1500 inhabitant village\
  \ for a while. I was, however, gravely mistaken.\n\nBe it a lack of health and safety\
  \ regulations, be it general clumsiness, be it karma, chance, fate or coincidence.\
  \ Be it whatever. I somehow managed to fall out of a third floor window. Fortuitously\
  \ I survived. The details of the event are rather murky in my mind but I\u2019m\
  \ told this is a symptom of my skull getting well acquainted with the concrete that\
  \ lined the streets of Aguas Calientes.\n\nI don\u2019t remember much from my trip.\
  \ Mainly because ninety percent of it was spent in a hospital bed succumbing to\
  \ narcotic induced fever dreams. But one thing that is crystalline in my head is\
  \ my memory of the people. Every single person I encountered. Taxi drivers, tour\
  \ guides, shaman in training, hostel staff and one particularly hilarious nurse\
  \ are as vivid as my thoughts five minutes ago. Smiling faces warmly invited me\
  \ to become entangled in the culture. Kind eyes offered affection and concern. I\
  \ could go on ad infinitum but nothing would truly convey the sense of wonderment\
  \ I was overcome with.\n\nFriends who visited Peru before me had gushed about how\
  \ magical it felt. Testimonies that I\u2019d previously listened to with a skeptical\
  \ ear now became increasingly more believable. Naturally it was a strange time for\
  \ me but I absolutely believe that even with a sober consciousness my perception\
  \ would be the same. And it makes sense. To behold, even just visually, Peru is\
  \ a land that will fill you with awe. Inhabiting this land must instill some element\
  \ of reverence that seeps out into the people you encounter.\n\nI try and live by\
  \ the tenet of \u201Cno regrets\u201D. But one thing I do regret is that I wasn\u2019\
  t able to experience Peru more thoroughly. What I am grateful for, though, is that\
  \ I\u2019m twenty-nine and Peru isn\u2019t going anywhere."
