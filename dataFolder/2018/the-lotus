Text: "\u201CBe still and watch for ripples,\u201D Ri-Shong advised as we sat in his\
  \ motionless rowboat on a lake in Shong-Shu. \n\nPastel pink lotuses of all shapes\
  \ and sizes gently grazed past our boat, unintentionally crowding the surface of\
  \ the lake and unruffled by the wind. I wondered where I could find ripples in the\
  \ densely occupied space.\n\nI examined the intricate timeline that wisely grew\
  \ on the old man\u2019s face and briefly questioned why I was never a part of it\
  \ until today. He turned to show me his weak smile that stretched from ear to ear\
  \ as he senses my gaze on the back of his head. After 20 years of lost communication,\
  \ the old man sure doesn\u2019t say much.\n\nFollowing the wrinkles and grooves,\
  \ I was reminded of what my mother had told me. In his steady hands, I saw the nine\
  \ children he could hardly raise. Along with his aged forearm, I caught a glimpse\
  \ of the poverty he had suffered in his youth, selling y\xF9l\xE1n flowers in the\
  \ middle of Taiwan\u2019s stifled and bottlenecked streets, weaving between idled\
  \ cars at red lights. On the bridge of his nose between his weary dark eyes, I recognized\
  \ the lanterns that glowed softly, hung on food stalls that stretched for miles\
  \ down the bustling night market streets. My mother had gushed about the dishes\
  \ he sold in his mobile food stall - his infamous r\u01D4 r\xF2u f\xE0n, a braised\
  \ pork rice dish, in which all of the passing tourists fell in love with.\n\nIn\
  \ all of his experiences hustling to sell trinkets, flowers, and food for a living,\
  \ I sat in awe with this resilient man whom I have never met until now. Travelling\
  \ through Taiwan, I had merely passed by locals that currently live in the same\
  \ conditions as he had. I was unaware of the hardships families and merchants endure.\n\
  \n\u201CYou see the lotus flowers around us?\u201D He broke the silence with his\
  \ heavy, low voice. I flinched abruptly, thinking he had heard what was in my mind.\n\
  \nI nodded with a sheepish grin, watching the smothered sun begin to set.\n\n\u201C\
  They emerge perfectly clean to the surface from a bed of mud and dirt,\u201D he\
  \ paused, shifting the position of his hands on the fishing pole.\n\n\u201CIn Buddhism,\
  \ it is a sign of rebirth. In many ways, the lotus is you,\u201D his tone suddenly\
  \ fell sorrowful. \u201CI was not around, so I am the mud that you escaped from.\u201D\
  \n\nI carefully grasped his shoulder, \u201CI also grew from the mud to the flower\
  \ I am now.\u201D\n\nThe sun had now faded behind the vast valleys, and his motionless\
  \ rowboat creaked beneath us as we sat in silence. The old man reeled his line in,\
  \ \u201CReady?\u201D"
