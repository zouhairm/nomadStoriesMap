Text: "My month long love affair with Panama was at its conclusion resulting in one\
  \ solid tan and one broken heart. By this point, I was becoming well practiced in\
  \ \u2018how to be nonchalant\u2019 in travel flings which of course would always\
  \ lead to an end but anyway, some me time was due (I kept telling myself). The loneliness\
  \ can ache at times when you\u2019re solo on the road but knowing the adventure\
  \ ahead gives you a certain type of freedom that can\u2019t be attained 8:30 to\
  \ 6:30 in fluorescent lighting. \nThe end of my Panama leg was abrupt but left me\
  \ with an immediate realisation. I met Daniel in my first hour in Panama City and\
  \ just hours before landing, I forked out $500 to get on the flight from Miami (because\
  \ I missed the fine print on the mandatory return flight required by state laws).\
  \ Frustrated and annoyed, a huge chunk of my travel money was gone but I knew life\
  \ was testing my trust. If I can go with the flow, where will it take me? If I ask\
  \ no questions and follow my gut, will I be guided exactly where I need to be? All\
  \ I knew was that I needed to get to Central and I needed to get there now. \nThe\
  \ humidity soaked my skin as soon as I exited at PTY late in the evening. It felt\
  \ good to be in tropical territory. An array of taxi drivers inundated the exit\
  \ and all competing for the newest arrivals. Quickly, I was scooped into a shuttle\
  \ and headed in the direction of a hostel in town. \nDaniel was tanned and fit (a\
  \ surfer) from Venezuela, as were all of his friends. The civil unrest had driven\
  \ most Venezuelans to seek new soil and so Daniel had wound up here. He owned three\
  \ hostels situated all around the country so I gladly accepted the opportunity to\
  \ accompany him on his mini tour to each coastal location as we took to the road\
  \ with his black Toyota Hilux and pup.\nI had spent almost a month with Daniel and\
  \ I could tell it was time to move on. The \u201Cgringo trail\u201D was the path\
  \ most trotted by westerners taking advantage of their well-earned dollars in this\
  \ comparatively affordable region of the world. In any event, flying was not a primary\
  \ mode for country hoping and the region was well connected via an intrinsic network\
  \ of \u201Cchicken buses\u201D (which, I calculated cost me US$3 per hour of travel\
  \ in Panama). I was back on the road, a little sad but recalled just one month earlier,\
  \ how I sat sobbing in the airport for my mistake. A mistake that in fact led me\
  \ to so many perfect decisions. I knew in that moment my duty here was to trust.\
  \ So, where would life guide me to next?"
