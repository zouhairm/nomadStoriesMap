Text: "My brother had lived in New Zealand for five years by the time I went to see\
  \ him. Eager to showcase a country he had come to love, Mark had plotted an ambitious\
  \ route. While I was happy to defer to his locally sourced knowledge I did insist\
  \ on two additions to his carefully crafted itinerary.  \n\nA breathtaking fjord\
  \ flanked by towering peaks, Milford Sound is a masterpiece of natural topography\
  \ gouged out of the coast of the South Island. This was my first addendum to the\
  \ travel schedule. My second demand was a stop off in Dunedin - a modest and charming\
  \ city with a distinctly British feel. While objectively a far less spectacular\
  \ location than Milford Sound, for me, this understated city occupied a very dramatic\
  \ spot on the globe. \n\nDunedin is the farthest populated place on the planet from\
  \ where I was born and raised in Ireland. The possibility of being as far away from\
  \ home as possible was nothing short of exhilarating. In anticipation, I practiced\
  \ feelings of intense liberation. With glee I braced for the exotic. \n\nDriving\
  \ into Dunedin I was caught off guard by a very familiar name - my own. \u2018Dowling\u2019\
  \ - a relatively uncommon Irish name, even in Ireland - was emblazoned across a\
  \ shop sign. By the time we arrived in the city center minutes later, I had been\
  \ taunted twice more by my own name. It had appeared over another business and then\
  \ again on a signpost for \u2018Dowling Street\u2019. Having come to Dunedin fully\
  \ armed with well-rehearsed feelings of adventure and heady alienation, seeing my\
  \ own name scattered throughout town was jarring. Dunedin was way off script. \n\
  \nI randomly inquired with a bartender about the prevalence of the name Dowling\
  \ in the area. She looked uncomfortable. Unbelievably, her last name was also Dowling\
  \ and she wondered with polite suspicion how I might have known that. She told us,\
  \ despite mounting evidence to the contrary, that Dowling was not a particularly\
  \ common name in that part of the country.  My expectations once again defied, and\
  \ fast running out of options, I gave myself over to the irony and humor of the\
  \ situation. \n\nI had expressly gone to Dunedin to feel every inch of the 11,945\
  \ curving miles that would separate me from where I was from. I had expected to\
  \ confront the enormity of the planet and to be squashed blissfully under the weight\
  \ of that encounter. Instead, I was reminded how wonderfully small this vast world\
  \ can sometimes be and how we are all connected in unexpected ways to even the farthest-flung\
  \ parts of it."
