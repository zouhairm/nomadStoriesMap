Text: "What if the hardest thing during a journey wouldn't be the one you're thinking\
  \ about?\n\nI was walking on the seaside, more exactly on the northwestern beach\
  \ of this island named Nusa Lembongan, in the south-east of Bali, when I realized\
  \ ... \nI was there, stunned by the magnificent landscape that Bali offered me.\
  \ Impressed by this monstrous volcano dominating absolutely everything around.\n\
  \nSo I said to myself, the hardest part during a journey is to \"realize\".\nThis\
  \ sublime thing, this wonderful show of nature offered to me, so small in front\
  \ of this immensity, made me realize that the hardest thing during the journey is\
  \ to realize.\n\nRealise that you are there!\n\_And then we remember myself back\
  \ at home, staring at the world map, saying to myself, one day I'll be there! I\
  \ remember that dream island, whose name simply amazes the whole world.\n\nAnd today,\
  \ me, Simon, I am on this small island, with under my nose and my amazed look, this\
  \ view, this dream come true, this expectation now truth.\n\nSo we take a few minutes\
  \ and we enjoy, we observe, we marvel, then we smile. Then comes a feeling of well\
  \ being and very soothing fullness that reminds us why we left, or rather, why we\
  \ are here.\n\n\_\nREALIZE THAT IT IS TRUE,\n\_... that it's real and enjoy it to\
  \ the maximum, not to regret. Forget the dream and live the present moment, forget\
  \ your ideas and prejudices, just to enjoy, savor.\n\n\_\nREALIZE AND ACCOUNT FOR\
  \ THIS TIME,\n\_... of this place, of this moment, fill with this beauty.\n\n\n\
  For this moment, like all past and all the next, are the moments that count and\
  \ that will remain in our memories.\n\nAll these things that make travel what it\
  \ is, an almost endless series of surprises and emotions."
