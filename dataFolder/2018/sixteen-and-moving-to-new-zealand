Text: "Warm air brushed my cheeks while my eyes took in the scenery around me. Hills\
  \ as big as the tallest building in The Netherlands lay stretched together in the\
  \ distance. I was 16, and I had just moved to New Zealand, a country that I had\
  \ never read about, let alone had seen. It was a shock to the system. No longer\
  \ could I go home, see my friends, family, or pets. I could not even speak my own\
  \ language anymore or eat all the favourite foods that we hoarded in the local supermarkets.\
  \ I hadn\u2019t felt so lost in my entire life.\n\nThat following year I got to\
  \ experience more than I bargained for. You were able to take hikes into the deepness\
  \ of the local hills in Richmond, Nelson. Walking between the trees and the fresh\
  \ scent of the ferns, you could hear the water trickling down it\u2019s path over\
  \ the rocks. Your reward came once you made it all the way to the top. A view so\
  \ magnificent it has been imprinted in my brain. In front of you was the whole of\
  \ the town, you could see the local vineyards for miles on end as the sun gave it\
  \ a warmish glow. \n\nGolden beaches, and blue oceans with flowers the color of\
  \ butter scattered everywhere, reminding me of the scent of coconuts. Jumping off\
  \ bridges into water so clear you could drink from it, and waterfalls the height\
  \ of a fully developed General Sherman tree. \n\nCampfires and barbeques on the\
  \ beach late at night while the full moon rose slowly with all it\u2019s white,\
  \ golden glory. Lighting up a sky as I had never seen before. A sky covered with\
  \ millions of stars together with the beauty of the Milky Way. It is the thing that\
  \ I miss the most to this day. The connection with nature and the galaxy above me.\
  \ \n\nThey say New Zealand is a country of adventure, but it is so much more than\
  \ that. It is a place where magic still flourishes, a place still untouched by the\
  \ insanity of the West. It is a country still full of secrets. \n\nThe most unexpected\
  \ thing that came out of this experience, was how much it shaped me into the women\
  \ I am today, nine years later. How it showed me that the world really is just one\
  \ big house with many rooms to visit. And why would you want to stay confined to\
  \ just one room? When there is a whole mansion to discover? This turning point in\
  \ my life turned my weakness into strength. Moving to me meant lack of stability,\
  \ yet now I have come to the realization that it gave me a passion to wander. To\
  \ see what other places could have in store for me. It is a strength to find a home\
  \ within the wholeness of this planet."
