Text: "\u201CWow, it looks like you\u2019re going to be the only non-Arabic speaker\
  \ this evening.\u201D Greta, my always chirpy German teacher, had just walked into\
  \ the pub clutching a picnic hamper of food and a couple of party hats. It was the\
  \ Christmas party. Confused, I asked Greta what that meant, my newly acquired non-Arabic\
  \ speaking status. \u201CSeems the only other people attending are our Syrian students\u2026\
  oh, and a couple of Turkish guys.\u201D She handed me a party hat. Her smile, always\
  \ fixed, seemed to waver a little at the edges. \u201CGood luck!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s funny, isn\u2019t it? His name sounds like \u2018Warhead\u2019.\u201D\
  \ one of the other teachers so helpfully added, as I returned from the bar and sat\
  \ back down with my new acquaintance. Wahid was 15, the youngest of the Syrian students,\
  \ though he looked much older. He had big, tired eyes and a burgeoning teenage moustache.\
  \ As we talked we veered from my limited and thoroughly incorrect German to his\
  \ much more impressively faltering English, and back again, smiling and laughing\
  \ awkwardly as we went, picking from the cup of pretzels when the conversation lulled.\
  \ He told me how he spoke Syrian, Arabic, Turkish, English, a little Greek, and\
  \ German. \u201CGreek!\u201D I blurted, \u201CI know some Greek. Kalispera?\u201D\
  \ He played along and we exchanged a few words. \u201CHow come you know Greek?\u201D\
  \ The question left my mouth as my mind pulled away and immediately realised the\
  \ obvious. He looked down at the floor, and just said, \u201CIn a camp.\u201D Right,\
  \ not on a Thomas Cook package holiday.\n\nThen he confessed. He\u2019d only started\
  \ talking to me because he wanted to know my secret: how did I just talk with Greta?\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s like you already know her.\u201D He said with a look of astonishment,\
  \ speaking on behalf of teenage boys the world over. I laughed. I didn\u2019t know\
  \ her \u2013 I was a student, just like him. Well\u2026not just like him. I shrugged,\
  \ \u201CBe yourself. All you have to do is talk to her.\u201D\n\nWahid\u2019s friend,\
  \ Mohammed, came back from the bar, nodding along to the music approvingly. \u201C\
  He\u2019s in a band.\u201D\n\u201CWe used to play at my university in Damascus,\
  \ but I don\u2019t think that even exists anymore.\u201D He said and laughed emptily.\
  \ And where were his bandmates? He didn\u2019t know. \n\u201CSo the band is on hiatus?\u201D\
  \ I offered. He nodded. \n\nThe cup of pretzels hadn\u2019t been refilled for a\
  \ while. It was late and I had to go. I said my goodbyes and as I walked through\
  \ the snow to the U-Bahn station, I imagined Wahid tentatively approaching Greta,\
  \ on behalf of teenage boys the world over."
