Text: Travelling liberates one in a way no other thing does,the beauty of it lies
  in the fact that you never know what your next destination has to offer you or what
  impact is it going to leave on you.I remember when I was a kid,I went to Kashmir
  with my family to see snowfall.I was intrigued by the lifestyle of the local people
  of Kashmir,because of the adversities they have to face even in their daily life,with
  ever nook and corner occupied by border security forces,and living under army influence,as
  some may know,that Kashmir is the bone of contention between India and Pakistan.For
  our trip across the whole Kashmir,we hired a tour guide cum driver to show us the
  spots.It was a 7 day trip,thus we happened to spend a whole lot of time with the
  guide and interacting with him,he was a man in his early 30s,married with kids and
  was interested in telling about his state's history and culture.I remember asking
  him on how does it feel to be under constant surveillance of national army,and he
  told me that it is quite an ordeal for people,as now and then,curfew is brought
  into action,where they cannot go out of their homes for 2-3 months,which sometimes
  extend to 6 months too,I was taken aback with the revelation and took a pity on
  their lives,I could see that even telling us about the thing made his face droop,I
  asked him about his children's education and he replied that is what keeps him going
  and makes him work more harder when there is off season of tourists,he also mentioned
  that he wants his children to attain a good level of education and make a better
  life for them,and wishes that his children do something for the valley to mitigate
  its chaos and diffuse the knowledge of peace and righteousness to its people,I was
  left shook by the optimism and kindness of the man,despite being suffering in a
  state,fighting with the surroundings,he does not want his children to leave that
  place and go settle somewhere else,but he wants them to stay and use their knowledge
  to enlighten the less privileged ones and make Kashmir a better place.I was touched
  and my respect for him skyrocketed.During the whole trip,we were accompanied by
  him and he made us aware of the tradition and history of places,with him taking
  pride in displaying his culture.The attachment that he had to his roots was inspiring
  and I consider that trip of mine to be an enriching experience of my life as it
  was not only travelling but the exposure to the quality of people that I met and
  felt a connection with.
