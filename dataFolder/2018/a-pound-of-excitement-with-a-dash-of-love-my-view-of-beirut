Text: "\u201CSometimes fate is like a small sandstorm that keeps changing directions.\
  \ You change direction but the sandstorm chases you. You turn again, but the storm\
  \ adjusts. Over and over you play this out, like some ominous dance with death just\
  \ before dawn.\u201D A statement by Haruki Murakami that pretty much sums up my\
  \ travel story. In 2015, I had to leave from Toronto, Canada to Beirut, Lebanon,\
  \ where my grandparents reside, to study in University there for a full year. As\
  \ melancholy as I was at first for leaving my family, it has been ultimately the\
  \ best life-changing experience and the start of the last thing I expected. \n\n\
  \ As the year begun, my adventure started when I first got to know a certain local\
  \ who took me by surprise and changed my view of the city. Our friendship began\
  \ early November, we were feeling hyped one night and and wanted to go out and have\
  \ some fun. However, having a middle-eastern-minded grandparents, kind of restricts\
  \ or limits the fun because of the political status of the country, so basically\
  \ as rebellious as I could be, I made sure they were sleeping then grabbed the key\
  \ and took off to Jbeil \u2013 Byblos, a place that is almost an hour away. It was\
  \ the first time I felt excited about breaking rules and oh it was worth it. Jbeil\
  \ was marvellous at night as it ever could be in midday. It took us back to ancient\
  \ Rome with its Phoenician charm that sits on the sea side of the country. \n  \
  \      \n        Our adventures heated up as the year passed, and one of the many\
  \ unforgettable events I had encountered that year was the stargazing event mid\
  \ February. He knew I had my head in space for so long that I couldn't miss the\
  \ chance of going and taking my eyes for a little swim in the vast ocean of stars.\
  \ We gathered as a group of friends and headed to a place called Iyoun Al Simen\
  \ just above Mount Lebanon far from light pollution and we stood there hours after\
  \ midnight, skywatching and sharing astronomical knowledge. One thinking of another\
  \ world that is out of reach is beyond one's wildest dreams, seeing it with one's\
  \ naked eyes is even more spectacular to describe. \n\n This local taught and inspired\
  \ me to read between the lines and make the best memories out of every moment spent\
  \ in this enchanting city. He showed me that living in Beirut was more than just\
  \ family reunions in the summer and busy people making their way in the city. We\
  \ have become closer than ever by the end of the year, which actually was the last\
  \ thing I expected from my trip to Beirut."
