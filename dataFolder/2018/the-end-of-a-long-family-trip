Text: "Minutes turned into hours. The sun left no shade to protect her growling stomach\
  \ from the beaming harsh rays or from Mo\u2019s rising anger. She watched Mo frantically\
  \ pace keeping an eye out for the bus, sweat glistening in his dark hair. Every\
  \ so often, he would kick up dust cursing his luck but Rayne didn\u2019t calm him,\
  \ held prisoner to her own fate. Instead, twirling her hair around her finger, she\
  \ examined the split ends that had grown since they got lost on their family trip,\
  \ when without warning, a black fog spread around her like a swarm of massive mosquitoes.\
  \ Out of nowhere, a rectangular box appeared with four deflated wheels, coated with\
  \ a layer of dirt giving it the illusion of a glass box. The bus was finally here.\
  \ \n\nMo warned Rayne that it would be a fast ride, but nothing prepared her for\
  \ the toxic scent it carried, stinging her eyes with tears. A beady-eyed man creaked\
  \ the doors open, greeting them with a lopsided smile from behind the wheel. Inside,\
  \ a child\u2019s wails pierced through Rayne\u2019s soul making her take a couple\
  \ steps back, but suddenly went silent without a whimper. The only sound that remained\
  \ was the echo of the driver\u2019s cackling laugh.\n\n\u201CYou better behave,\u201D\
  \ the driver shouted, waving his long, gnarled finger as they stepped onto the dimmed\
  \ bus full of cramped passengers. Rayne stumbled down the crowded aisle, stepping\
  \ over outstretched legs and various shaped luggage. Not a single person moved as\
  \ they made their way to two open seats, still as statues. As soon as they sat down,\
  \ the bus went flying down the streets causing luggage to slide down the aisle.\
  \ The lights flickered for a bit, then went completely dark. Rayne adjusted to the\
  \ blackness with long blinks, catching glimpses of stony stares when in the darkest\
  \ corner of the bus, she saw a familiar face. \n\nIt was unmistakably him. She could\
  \ recognize that curly hair and those eyes anywhere. Her brother was sitting on\
  \ the same bus with his head hanging low! Rayne tried to walk to him, to hug him\
  \ and cry freely in his arms, to ask if he knew where the other family members are,\
  \ to tell him how much she missed him as she recounted all of her adventures, but\
  \ the speed of the bus kept her glued to her seat. Resorting to wait till the next\
  \ stop, Rayne stared at the only face she had been longing to see for the past couple\
  \ months, sitting with a goofy smile plastered to her face on the creepiest bus\
  \ ride of her life."
