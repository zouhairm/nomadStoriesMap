Text: "I love to travel. I\u2019m the type of girl who is still talking about her\
  \ trip from three years ago. I\u2019m subscribed to that romantic idea of travel;\
  \ the \u201CEat, Pray, Love\u201D of it all. I am chasing the idea that somehow,\
  \ we inherently change as a person, just by stepping off the plane. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s how I\u2019ve found myself three months into a trip around southeast Asia, chasing\
  \ sunsets through Bali and scootering around rice fields. It\u2019s the picture-perfect\
  \ escape. Just imagine me, hands outspread, gorgeous landscape in the background.\
  \ I must be living the dream, right? Frankly put, not always. This hasn\u2019t been\
  \ all I thought it would be and I\u2019m definitely not in the place I thought I\
  \ would be when I started out. \n\nAnd we\u2019ve heard it all before. Travel changes\
  \ a person. It turns us into amazing storytellers, able to fill our lives with interesting\
  \ experiences and irreplaceable opportunities. It helps to break down superficial\
  \ barriers and have us experience different cultures. The sheer action of leaving\
  \ the familiarity of home behind opens us up to new opportunities and gives us the\
  \ space from the trivial problems that usually hold us down. \n\nBut sometimes,\
  \ the greatest change travel can bring is just a change in scenery. \n\nSo, now,\
  \ three months into a \u201Ccarefree\u201D trip through Bali, I must be living the\
  \ dream, right? Frankly put, not always. It\u2019s hard to accept that this might\
  \ not be everything I want it to be; to accept these three hard truths. Just leaving\
  \ your routine behind doesn\u2019t automatically erase the emotional tolls of being\
  \ stuck in it. Rather, the excitement of being in a new place, the new foods to\
  \ try and the new friends we meet can instead be distractions from addressing why\
  \ we felt the need to escape in the first place. \n\nYet, growth is never as they\
  \ dramatize in the movies \u2013 with a light bulb above your head or at the end\
  \ of a makeover montage. So, why do we expect it from travelling? \n\nLeaving behind\
  \ the expectation that I need a Hallelujah moment has been that freedom-embracing\
  \ moment. Shirking the picture of what this change has to look like and instead,\
  \ allowing for whatever may come has moved more mountains in my life than I could\
  \ pose against. And it sure helps that I\u2019ve been able to see a lot of great\
  \ mountains while I\u2019m at it. \n\nTravelling might not solve everything. But\
  \ where\u2019s the fun in not trying?"
