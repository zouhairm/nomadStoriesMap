Text: "I had a fight with my uncle in Guadalajara. I was there to stay with him after\
  \ 5 years with no chances to see him, and we had a fight. We had a fight on the\
  \ street and I run away from him, tired with entering shops, and males, and usual-worldwide\
  \ cemeteries of walking money human. I was 22, I was in Mexico and I got lost. Taking\
  \ a beer in a bar, a man had an overdose just beside. The ambulance came. After\
  \ a rough check, the man was left in the street to die. The horror had me. Walked\
  \ away, asked for directions to reach the hotel to my uncle: no help. Just in the\
  \ time I was captured by the cold chain of panic, in the deep night of Guadalajara,\
  \ my cousin Miguel, the son of my uncle's wife, called me. He reached me after 2\
  \ hours in the deep night of Guadalajara. It was 10 pm, maybe. I thought we would\
  \ have headed to the hotel but no, he started to hoover white lady and wild ride\
  \ in the uknown town of Guadalajara. \"Tranquilo\" told me, \"I already call my\
  \ mom and set things good\". I didn't know what to think of, didn't know what to\
  \ say, he just sniffed and spoke, spoke as a fire machine: and bla bla Guadalajara\
  \ is tough, bla bla here the narcos are tough, bla bla they throw granades in clubs\
  \ and bar and restourants and everywhere, bla bla, we're heading to a party now,\
  \ bla bla, careful with girls, double cover on it. We arriveded at the place around\
  \ 11 or maybe not: time progression collapses in my memory from this point and all\
  \ I remember is just a flow of fragmented streaks of colored sounds. Something made\
  \ the way to oblivion. The music, yes maybe the music: was something else: as a\
  \ shaman from Montezuma's throne have came to play before the end of times. \nSomehow\
  \ we ended with two girls in the car. I remember my cousin was throwing condoms\
  \ in the back seats. I was probably trying to breath in the mouth of a firing chica.\
  \ Then the car stopped and before I could realize what galaxy was where we landed\
  \ to, a cop was before me holding a machine-gun as long as a caiman, starring at\
  \ me. I was shitting in my pants. \"Now is gonna be jail in the deep night of Guadalajara\"\
  \ I thought, maybe, \"a jail 'cause I wanted to avoid mouls... there is you proud\
  \ now\". When I was about to puke, my cousin handed the just bribe to the officers\
  \ and we turned to be safe and I puked.\nThe day after I met my uncle at breakfast.\
  \ I glance him. \"I'm sorry uncle\" I said. We had a warm,  slow hug where I wept\
  \ out my panic. \"You stay with me now, underestand?\" he said. \"Yes\" I said."
