Text: "I\u2019m a slow human being. When I graduated and left the so far most important\
  \ place in my my life, the sorrow hit one month later. When we were saying goodbye\
  \ to each other, I watched my friends having either tears in their eyes or simply\
  \ weeping. I wanted to feel that too. Instead at the time the emotion came I was\
  \ alone in my room, in the hotel I was working in the South of France, throwing\
  \ up in the middle of the night and burying my head to stinking sheets to prevent\
  \ howling out loud. \n\nEven though I\u2019m lacking that accelerator in by brain\
  \ which is also known sometimes as spontaneity, my dancing body sometimes surprises\
  \ me. \n\nI was waiting a train in Marseille. A way too early, but I\u2019m those\
  \ people who rather wait forty-five minutes drinking coffee watching the flow of\
  \ people. That day I didn\u2019t get my coffee. Because before my nose could smell\
  \ the nearest train station snack bar, my ears heard the music. \n\nThey\u2019ve\
  \ put a piano in the hall, to let people use their talent of playing and others\
  \ to enjoy that. At that moment a young man was playing it. In black duffel coat\
  \ and black rolling luggage bag beside him. \n\nHe told me his name and I told mine\
  \ when we afterwards came back to this world and became those people who have to\
  \ run to catch their trains. I don\u2019t remember it, I\u2019m sorry. But he was\
  \ going to Toulon and had sweaty and friendly handshake. I was going to Aix-En-Provence\
  \ and had sweaty and happy smile on my face. \n\nI remember sitting on a bench nearby\
  \ him to listen, but I\u2019ve trouble remembering how and why I left by rucksack\
  \ somewhere on the station floor and took off my jacket and let the sound affect\
  \ me. Danced.\n\nIt was the first time for me to be abroad for a longer period of\
  \ time. My mother had taken me to the airport, she\u2019d insisted to do it. She\
  \ had already sent two daughters to the world without return ticket, but those are\
  \ probably the things impossible to get used to. I could feel her worry, but personally\
  \ I didn't feel like traveler. Is there something you\u2019re supposed to feel on\
  \ the edge of new and unknown? I was super sacred of course and actually I felt\
  \ like I had no interest to go at all. Fear transformed to urge of rejection. Nevertheless,\
  \ one of my greatest teachers said once: \u201DAsk yourselves: does doing this thing\
  \ kill me? You can manage with losing a little bit money and being ashamed it comes\
  \ to that\u201D. \n\nPeople kept running by, he kept playing on, I kept dancing\
  \ with the music. We had time for one more song and one more after that."
