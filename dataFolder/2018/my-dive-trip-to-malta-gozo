Text: "I wanted to go diving and looked for a destination which was not that expensive\
  \ and not that far away from germany. The worth seeing goal was gozo. My diving\
  \ buddy in germany was at Gozo 2 years before and she recommended it to me. So I\
  \ was looking for some dive centers on Malta to go there. I found a good offer of\
  \ the diving tour operator Nautilus and send them an enquiry for one week in Xemxija.\
  \ In my booking request I wanted to have a simple hotel but they told me that offered\
  \ one is okay. I was happy and booked for october.\nThen it was finally time form\
  \ y holiday. In Germany it was autumn - cold and windy and I made my way to the\
  \ airport. At noon, I arrived at the airport in Malta and went in to search for\
  \ my driver who should bring me to my hotel. After a few meters through the small\
  \ airport and always running after the people in front of me, I saw a nice lady\
  \ with my name on a sign and waved her smiling. After a friendly welcome, she asked\
  \ for my luggage. Oh .. yes, of course I have a suitcase with me .. but that is\
  \ .. still on the baggage conveyor belt .. Since I was so happy blindly followed\
  \ the people in front of me to the exit, I have also completely overlooked the luggage\
  \ belts. That started well. So I turned on my heel and told her I was going to get\
  \ my suitcase quickly. Easier said than done. Before I walked 3 steps towards the\
  \ arriving passengers, called me a security man and told me that I was going in\
  \ the wrong direction. I explained my adversity to him and he took me with a skeptical\
  \ look into a non-public area. There I had to sign a form that I really only forgot\
  \ my luggage and then he accompanied me to the baggage conveyor belt on which my\
  \ suitcase quite lonely turned his rounds. \nSo I grabbed it and hurried back to\
  \ my driver, who was now a bit acidified. After a relaxed conversation everything\
  \ was fine again and we drove on the left side of the street into a roundabout traffic!\
  \ I had totally forgotten that .. Of course you drive on the other side than in\
  \ Germany! I relaxed again and enjoyed the ride and the explanations of my driver\
  \ to the sights.\nThe next day I went in search of my dive center Mad Shark Diving\
  \ and met very nice people there, with whom I drove the next 5 days on diving trips.\
  \ We saw wrecks, the famous Azure Window and many great fish species. During the\
  \ crossing to Gozo by ferry I lost my way and did not find the parking deck again.\
  \ That was a fun! My new diving friends did not take their eyes off me since that\
  \ moment."
