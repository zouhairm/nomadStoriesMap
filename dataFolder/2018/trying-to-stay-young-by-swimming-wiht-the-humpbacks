Text: "I still can hear my coaches from swim team yelling at me from the edge of the\
  \ pool. Pushing me harder every day to be faster and stronger. But that was a couple\
  \ of decades ago. Now I found myself out in open ocean with rolling swells that\
  \ blocked any view of the nearby shoreline. The deep blue waters of the French Polynesian\
  \ that surround the little island of Mo\u2019orea. Water color so dense your eyes\
  \ start playing tricks. No longer did I have that luxury of the black painted lines\
  \ on the bottom of the pool. But rather the darkest of deep blue waters that offered\
  \ no guidance to where I was or going.\nSee, I was on an excursion with a group\
  \ that was trying to see the Humpback Whales. Surrounded by kids that were half\
  \ my age. My wife since gave up and is back on the boat. Sure she was now enjoying\
  \ a cold beverage and watching the rest of this determined group. We were not only\
  \ trying to stay with the guide, but also the whales that were not far off. Off\
  \ where the surface meets the light in the distance. I can see the guide\u2019s\
  \ extra-long flippers in the distance. It looked like she was standing still. So\
  \ the whales must be close. Already having put in a good mile of swimming. I felt\
  \ like I had enough in the tank to push it a little farther. In the back of my mind\
  \ I hear one of my coaches urging me to keep going. While my body is starting to\
  \ succumb to father time, my determination hasn\u2019t slowed.\nCatching up to where\
  \ the guide was leisurely floating. The first image of a mother and her calf became\
  \ clear. They were maybe 30 ft. below. Just stopping a little bit for a breather\
  \ before moving on in their migration. The calves are now about 10 feet long. But\
  \ small enough to require their mother to hover over them like most mammals do with\
  \ their kids. By now I am close to the guide. I look back down and see the mother\
  \ start to stir. With calf in tow they move off to the right of me just so slightly.\
  \ Then with just a little flip of the tail. Both head to the surface so gracefully.\
  \ Mom breaks the surface then the baby. Both of them stick their heads out of the\
  \ water and point themselves back straight down into the abyss and disappear. I\
  \ have been waiting months for this trip to have this once in a lifetime experience.\
  \ It was here and gone in a flash. But oh so worth it. Looking around I see only\
  \ one other from the group left. All others have gone back. Not only I out swam\
  \ all those younger than I. But to have an awe inspiring moment with nature was\
  \ the real trophy for me."
