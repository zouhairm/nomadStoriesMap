Text: "James leaned across the table. \u201CThere are 3 rules\u201D, he said, counting\
  \ them off on his fingers as he spoke. \u201C1. No pictures. 2. No posting online.\
  \ 3. You have to turn off location on your phone.\u201D I agreed, still trying to\
  \ figure out how my travelmates knew James.\nI was on a roadtrip around Tasmania\
  \ with three others. We'd started out the trip as strangers, brought together via\
  \ a Facebook post. A week later, and things were going well. An issue with the car\
  \ had brought us back south, ultimately to Bruny Island, six hours away from the\
  \ mountains where we were supposed to be. On the other hand, maybe exactly where\
  \ we were supposed to be. That's where we ran into James.\nJames lives on Bruny\
  \ Island. He has a piece of land there that he bought last year. Contrary to our\
  \ expectations, he does not grow weed. He is committed to living off the grid and\
  \ his rules are a part of that mindset.\nJames took over our itinerary. He told\
  \ us about the whaling history of the island and took us on his favorite walk along\
  \ the sea cliffs, telling stores as we went. We ate a potluck dinner with his friends\
  \ where I had the freshest fish I've ever tasted.\nBruny Island fits James. It's\
  \ tough to describe it. All of Tasmania feels a little extra wild, but on Bruny\
  \ that feeling is even stronger. It's an island at the end of the earth. It's small,\
  \ but it feels like like there are secrets that only years of observation could\
  \ uncover. James talked about that too, and how he was starting to be attuned to\
  \ the ones on his own property.\nAfter dinner we took a night tour of the lighthouse.\
  \ The weather was picking up, and rain lashed at us as we walked straight into the\
  \ wind. Grasses waved wildly, tree limbs glistened with water droplets, and clouds\
  \ obscured any view of the moon. I was ready to turn back right then, but instead\
  \ we pressed forward. We didn't speak as we climbed the stairs to the top, with\
  \ only the faint glow of a flashlight illuminating our faces.\nWe stepped onto the\
  \ balcony, shuffling our feet on the rain-soaked surface. We stared south toward\
  \ Antarctica. Even though I knew it was impossible, I felt I could sense it just\
  \ over the horizon. The harsh winds suddenly seemed friendlier, and I was aware\
  \ of how connected the whole earth is, through winds and oceans and people. I felt\
  \ at peace.\nWhen I look back on those days, James and Bruny Island are entwined\
  \ for me, both encompassing the same free, unhurried, raw thing. Because of James,\
  \ a piece of me will always feel at home on Bruny."
