Text: "I was the last AirBnB available in all Florence. The place was far, but my\
  \ host was kind enough to help me with my oversized luggage and offered me a cup\
  \ of coffee. After some small talk, he asked me about my plans for the night and\
  \ when I confessed I had a date with Netflix, he seemed horrified. He said his son\
  \ lived nearby and he wouldn't mind taking me out to show me around. I hesitated.\
  \ The plan sounded like a potential set up for a date and I had a boyfriend waiting\
  \ for me back home and no energy to do my make up. However, I did not want to offend\
  \ my host, especially after I might have damaged his spine with my luggage. So I\
  \ agreed to meet Diego, his son, and I was very glad to find out that, although\
  \ we got along pretty well, we did not have the slightest chemistry between us.\
  \ After few cups of gelato, he asked me if I would be OK if we picked up his buddy\
  \ Marco and go to his place to eat pizza. I agreed and Marco joined us a bit later.\
  \ Although he was everything the stereotype of how an Italian guy should be said,\
  \ at least according to American sitcoms, he did not speak a word of Spanish or\
  \ English. Even with Diego translating, it was hard to keep the conversation going,\
  \ so Marco decided play his guitar to pass the time. \u2018Is that B\xE9same Mucho?\u2019\
  \ I asked after he started playing. \u2018Do you know it?\u2019, he inquired, excited,\
  \ in Italian. I replied in Spanish that almost everyone knew that song in Mexico.\
  \ However, I had been so busy feeling awkward that I hadn\u2019t realised that our\
  \ languages were so similar that there was little need of a translator. Also, to\
  \ find a connection with home in such an unexpected place broke any language barrier\
  \ we could ever have. Marco continued playing and I joined in singing the firs verses.\
  \ Both of us managed to speak the only language we had in common that night. Near\
  \ dawn, Diego lit a cigarette and passed it to Marco, who smoked slowly. He breathed\
  \ in and then passed it to me. I took it and wrapped my lips around the edge, in\
  \ the same spot that Marco had put his. There was no contact between us that night,\
  \ but, somehow, that puff felt almost like a kiss. Before leaving, Marco stopped\
  \ me and asked if I could sing the song one more time. He wanted to record it in\
  \ his phone. I agreed. Marco had a recording and I had a smoke kiss. We both left\
  \ Diego\u2019s place with different kinds of souvenirs. I never saw Marco and not\
  \ even Diego again after that night. However, I still keep B\xE9same Mucho as my\
  \ ring tone for unknown numbers."
