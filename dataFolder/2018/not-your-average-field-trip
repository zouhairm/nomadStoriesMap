Text: "My professor had been talking about this field trip for the whole semester.\
  \ We were excited as any study abroad students could be, waking up at 5 in the morning\
  \ to take a 9-hour bus ride (with no bathroom or air conditioning) across the country.\
  \ The class was called Marine Conservation and we had been intensely studying sea\
  \ turtles and this was our chance to actually work with them in the field. \n\n\
  We headed up to Guanacaste, one of the countries most beautiful, and most impoverished,\
  \ provinces. The lush, dense jungle landscape gave way to flat, yellow savannah\
  \ grasslands that stretched for miles. \n\nWe were tasked with patrolling the beaches\
  \ at 3 am until 5 am, every night, to ensure that poachers weren't stealing the\
  \ eggs. After two nights of this, spending our days cleaning the beach from litter\
  \ and trash, and not seeing a single turtle, the students were all exhausted. I\
  \ remember hearing the other students complaining about how they couldn't wait for\
  \ the field trip to be over. Looking out over the vast, turquoise ocean, watching\
  \ the waves lap up against the ebony sand, black from the rich volcanic soil. I\
  \ never wanted the field trip to end. \n\nThe last day, all 27 sleep deprived and\
  \ sunburnt students piled into dingy-like boats and headed out across the water\
  \ to snorkel and look for sea turtles to capture and tag for research. It was only\
  \ a matter of minutes before the creams of agony began. Jellyfish - sea turtles'\
  \ preferred meal - were plentiful in the nutrient-rich waters and were enough to\
  \ dissuade many of the students from snorkeling. One by one, they eventually exited\
  \ the ocean.\n\nI veered off from the other students doing my best to avoid the\
  \ jellies that dotted the water, I thought to myself that there was no way I was\
  \ going to find a sea turtle, especially with the din that the other students were\
  \ making. I began to hum a tune to myself and considered turning around when I saw\
  \ her. A huge female green sea turtle, an endangered species, was resting on the\
  \ seabed. At about four feet across, and I knew by the sheer size of her that she\
  \ was at least 75 years old.  I must have made a sound because she turned, inky\
  \ black eyes looking up at me. Unblinking, she seemed to have an awareness about\
  \ her that cannot be explained, only understood by those looking into the eyes of\
  \ a sentient animal. \n\nWe looked at each other for a few moments, that seemed\
  \ to last forever, then she turned and swam away.\n\nAnd I don't think I've ever\
  \ been the same since."
