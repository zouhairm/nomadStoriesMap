Text: "It was eight in the morning in Brussels. Dark, malicious clouds hovered over\
  \ the little street by the homestay where I had spent the cold night. I washed and\
  \ started to pack up for the journey ahead to Brugge. This was my maiden trip across\
  \ the country and Brugge had stolen my heart from its very first postcard picture.\
  \ Gothic buildings with their mold colonies, cobbled streets from a bygone era,\
  \ the canals and watchtowers, tiny chocolate museums in every corner imaginable.\
  \ As I planned the day in my mind, I saw how windy it had gotten. Sequoia trees\
  \ around the neighborhood rustled and swayed in all glory, even when the sleet came\
  \ down like a volley of bullets. Suddenly, there was commotion in the common room\
  \ as someone turned on the TV. The voices grew louder and hysterical as I peered\
  \ in to hear that on this fateful day, a city-wide lockdown had been imposed as\
  \ a scale-4 terror alert resounded throughout Brussels. The Paris bombings had occurred\
  \ just a week ago and the apprehension of it happening again were rife. \n\nPeople\
  \ started trickling out of the homestay, everyone going to someplace known and safer,\
  \ till the city returned to normality. Army convoys passed through the main street\
  \ and everywhere, tension hung heavy like smoke. The metro had closed down, taxi\
  \ drivers were rushing home. That evening, I took a walk around Grote Markt, trying\
  \ to decide how to get home, as there was no vehicle going to Brugge. It looked\
  \ like a ghost town; everything was lit but closed, all tuck shops and cafes, like\
  \ somebody had left the lights on to come back, but had not made it. What till yesterday\
  \ was a vibrant marketplace had turned so quiet today that you could hear your breath\
  \ as it rose and fell. Every half mile, an armored car came into sight, it was as\
  \ if the nation was preparing for war. The entire year, Europe had been at strife\
  \ and this was like the final call, a careful leadership retaliating to the blatantly\
  \ corrupt ones.\n\nIn the chill bite of the next morning, around four AM, I picked\
  \ up my bags and started walking through a dark alleyway, my mind dead focused on\
  \ reaching the train station in one piece but my mortal fears conjuring up into\
  \ near-live figures beside me. It seemed like ages before a flickering light came\
  \ up on the horizon. I quickened my pace as Brussels Central came into view, as\
  \ though stopping for a second would cost me my home forever. In the hustle-bustle\
  \ of the platform, I felt warmer and with bated breath, waited for a train to arrive."
