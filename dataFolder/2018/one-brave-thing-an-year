Text: "Over the last few years, I had developed a methodology to walk out of my comfort\
  \ zone, one step at a time. This resolution of sorts led to the invention of my\
  \ \"one-brave-thing-an-year\" rule that I have been following for the past couple\
  \ of years. \nLast year, this was attending a ball night halfway across my country,\
  \ which was roughly seven hundred miles far. Over the years of changing cities and\
  \ moving back and forth between places, I have come to realize that the thing about\
  \ traveling is that it often turns out to be more exhausting than rewarding, especially\
  \ when the only reason you undertake it in the first place is that you think you\
  \ have to. More so when you are a postgraduate student with a busy academic schedule\
  \ and your ball partner is an old classmate you haven't met in the last decade.\
  \ I have traveled alone numerous times but it always seemed to qualify as commute\
  \ rather than travel. This time was different. I was interning in Mumbai, which\
  \ wasn't my city, to begin with; and I had to travel to Ezhimala, a completely unknown\
  \ small town in Kerala. The journey from each side consisted of seven legs including\
  \ a taxi, a subway, two auto-rickshaws, a flight, a train, and a bus ride to reach\
  \ the destination. Instead of complaining, the pleasure of researching for my own\
  \ trip, booking and arranging for amenities, and following it flawlessly to the\
  \ dot gave me the right mixture of dopamine and adrenaline to be thrilled for the\
  \ evening that awaited me.\nI had initially agreed to attend due to social obligations.\
  \ I was apprehensive for several reasons. To begin with, I am not a great dancer,\
  \ so ballroom dancing wasn't exactly my idea of fun. Also, considering myself an\
  \ introvert, I had willfully signed up for an evening to socialize with strangers.\
  \ However, as the DJ opened with the opening credits theme of 20th Century Fox,\
  \ I knew it had to be my night. I believe I managed and I may dare to say that I\
  \ managed quite spectacularly. For an evening with men clad in Indian Navy uniform,\
  \ beautiful ladies in evening gowns, swoon-worthy music, and dazzling wine, the\
  \ last thing I expected was to be completely at ease and enjoy myself thoroughly.\
  \ Surprisingly, I even became friends with the girl I shared my hotel room and am\
  \ still in contact with.\nIt was a night full of grandeur and I soaked in its brilliance,\
  \ giddy and charged up for my journey back. In addition, it made me change my annual\
  \ brave thing to a monthly affair."
