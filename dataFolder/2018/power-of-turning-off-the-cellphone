Text: "He called the day before and left a message the 3rd time around. My phone was\
  \ off as I had decided to only turn it on when needed.\nThe next day, as I walked\
  \ the 1 1/2 miles, I was excited and nervous as it was my first time doing something\
  \ like this.\nThe crisp early morning air was refreshing. The Spanish moss looked\
  \ beautiful with the morning light filtering through it.\nI get there 5 minutes\
  \ early. He comes on time. We shake hands. Exchange pleasantries. He asks me if\
  \ I got his message. \nThe expression on my face must have given him the answer.\
  \ He says people don\u2019t always give out the correct number. I assure him that\
  \ he has the correct number.\nI tell him why my phone is off. He looks down and\
  \ I cannot see his expression. Does he think me weird? Who keeps their phone off\
  \ even if they are on vacation? \nHe is talking and I am lost in thought thinking\
  \ that he is going to cancel. All that excitement and nervousness bundle up in my\
  \ stomach. \nI snap out of it when he asks me if I still want to go ahead as planned.\
  \ Yes, please!\nWe take the winding stairs to the second floor. There is no door.\n\
  The place is huge. He designed it. There is plenty of natural light and it is decorated\
  \ in neutral colors with two bright colored paintings on opposite walls. Elegant,\
  \ inviting and comfortable. I start to relax.\nHe seems a little nervous. He asks\
  \ me to wash my hands first. I like that. Clean hands are a must.\nHe explains what\
  \ we are going to do. Oh my!!! this is going to be a lot.\nI answer all his questions.\
  \ I have to be comfortable as this is all for me.\nI tell him what I want. He is\
  \ okay with all of it.\nThere is a bottle of local red wine open and airing. Smells\
  \ spicy. It has to wait.\nWe have to first finish everything we had to do with the\
  \ knife before we start drinking the wine.  \nMy knife skills get his approval.\
  \ \nAs soon as the skillets are on the stove, I reach for the wine glasses.\nI do\
  \ a toast to thank him for doing the cooking class even though I was the only student\
  \ that day. It was my first cooking class and it was also the first time he had\
  \ only one student in the class; that explained his initial nerves.\nThe meal was\
  \ delicious [fried chicken and grits among others] and so was the bottle of wine.\
  \ Cup of coffee paired with locally made dark chocolate with cranberries and pistachios\
  \ called it an end.\nGood decision to keep the phone off. The class being cancelled\
  \ or a different menu was the last thing I wanted to happen on my very first cooking\
  \ class experience."
