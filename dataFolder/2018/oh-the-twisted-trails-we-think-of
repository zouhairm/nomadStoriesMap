Text: "When you get stuck in your mind the world can be a scary place. Doctors and\
  \ therapists started saying things like \u201CSevere anxiety, depression, ptsd,\
  \ agoraphobia.\u201D I wasn\u2019t sure what I was experiencing, all I knew was\
  \ I felt empty, cold, and always afraid of what was to come. I was a prisoner in\
  \ my own mind, looking out at this beautiful world and seeing all the horrifying\
  \ possibilities. I knew that I wanted so much from life, I have always wanted to\
  \ travel and see the world. I\u2019ve always said that I\u2019m not meant for the\
  \ typical 9 to 5 with no windows, I\u2019ve always been so hungry for adventure,\
  \ for traveling.\nAs a child, my family took me on cruises to see the glistening\
  \ Sawyer Glaciers, the dusty streets of Tijuana along side mules painted like Zebras,\
  \ the hustle and bustle of the urban jungle of Chicago. \nThese past few years I\u2019\
  ve been scared of the world and what my days outside of those safe four walls I\
  \ call home may hold in store for me. I fell so far down this deep, dark hole called\
  \ depression and it felt like no one could hear me calling for help. Or rather,\
  \ no one simply knew how to help. I\u2019ve had to give up working full time because\
  \ my stress makes me literally sick. So, one day I was just sick to my stomach,\
  \ and tired of laying in the same position all day every day hoping for answers.\
  \ I simply got up and decided to walk. \nI live in a beautiful state in the Pacific\
  \ Northwest. Rain or shine, it\u2019s absolutely stunning outside. Tall pines standing\
  \ over me, beautiful mountain ranges cradling my town securely. It was a breath\
  \ of fresh air that my mind and body so badly needed. The twinkling rays of light\
  \ dancing between pine needles, the damp pebbles drying out after a night\u2019\
  s rain, the clean air that seemed to wipe my memories of the day and recall me to\
  \ that present moment. Wildlife around me causes so much joy and excitement it\u2019\
  s as if I\u2019m a child again. This feeling was more euphoric than any drug, more\
  \ relieving than and prescription the doctors could recommend. The last thing I\
  \ expected was that I could truly help myself by giving into nature, spending time\
  \ among the pine giants and soaking in sunshine.\nThe results are addicting. I\u2019\
  ve now purchased a Discover Pass so I can continue my adventures and travel through\
  \ the state parks around me. I still have big goals like backpacking Europe and\
  \ spending time in Japan, but for now I\u2019m just happy to have found myself in\
  \ the wild. I hope to help others in sharing my findings and continue telling my\
  \ story."
