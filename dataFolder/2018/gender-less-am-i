Text: "\u201COUCH\u201D! I yelled when someone stepped over my feet, \u201CGET ASIDE\
  \ IDIOT\u201D, the words hit me as my senses muster, I noticed myself being hindrance\
  \ in the middle of a subway. I took out my earplugs that have been playing the same\
  \ tatty song since ages, folded the museum map, as I stumbled with a girl, weeping,\
  \ a beggar, in India it is common, and so I disdain and decided to walk.\nI felt\
  \ a little hand across my waist, it was the same girl, I tried to twitch her hand\
  \ but she clutched tight, \u201Cwhat do you want?\u201D I screeched. \u201CSome\
  \ clothes\u201D, she wailed. \u201CI don\u2019t have any, go away.\u201D I strove\
  \ to ignore.\n\u201CNobody is helping me, my sister is hurt and bleeding, help,\
  \ I will give you money\u201D. As she finished she took out some pennies out from\
  \ her ragged pocket, the chill runs through my spine. Being Indian my thoughts about\
  \ \u201Cthese people\u201D have always been shoddy as I have grown up learning same.\n\
  \u201CDidi! Can you help.\u201D she beseeches. \u201COK.\u201D I replied. \u201C\
  She is sitting there, on the street\u201D as she points. \u201CDon\u2019t cry\u201D\
  \ I assured her but was uncertain myself.\nWe crossed subway, and there she was,\
  \ sitting on the street, I saw few people around her, staring; men laughing, and\
  \ women with disgust in their eyes. \u201CWhat\u2019s happening\u201D I mumbled.\
  \ \u201CMadam. Go away, it\u2019s a trick to thug money, don\u2019t fall for it\u201D\
  . A man from a group said. \u201CI know what I am doing, let me see\u201D. I said.\n\
  There, a 13 years old girl, covering her legs with a tattered frock, which was red\
  \ from ends. \u201CHey! What happened? Are you okay?\u201D I affirmed. \u201CI am\
  \ okay\u201D, she bawled. \u201CI am here, show me where you're hurt\u201D I assured.\n\
  She pointed her finger towards her groin, \u201Cwho hurt you there?\u201D I asked.\
  \ Being in India, the word rape came into my mind. \u201CI don\u2019t know, I woke\
  \ up like this, I asked people for help but they pushed me away, see, I have a bruise\
  \ here\u201D she showed me her bleeding elbow. \u201CShe is having periods, go away.\u201D\
  \ A lady in a crowd said. I stood there, gaped at that woman and asked, \u201CYou\
  \ knew it? Why didn\u2019t you aided?\u201D. \u201CShe is poor, it\u2019s disgusting.\
  \ I am going temple I can\u2019t touch her\u201D she replied. \u201CGo away\u201D\
  \ i squawked, the people around went off saying that I am going to die with a disease.\
  \ I took no notice and turned back to the girl, staring her for a moment, I thought,\
  \ where are we? On moon or in a pit? Using smart phones or being assholes? I helped\
  \ her or not that doesn't matter, what matters is being poor is questionable here.\
  \ \nGirls are not safe, guys are impostors, I am speechless and may be now\u2026\
  gender-less."
