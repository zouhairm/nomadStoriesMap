Text: "It is one of those rainy days with thunderstorm that have strong effects on\
  \ our mood. When I first arrived, I felt a bit emotional, even though it should\
  \ be a total new and exciting experience. We traveled through nice concrete road\
  \ to uneven mud road. Our bus was successfully colored to brown from bright white\
  \ and with scattered random decoration, which I considered somehow in artistic style.\
  \ Then we stepped out of the bus, I still couldn't believe I was then in a totally\
  \ new continent with everything exotic including air particles. I breathed deeply\
  \ trying to detect some minor chemical information transmitted through air, and\
  \ I began to ponder how will this village be like? Could it be colorful and artistic\
  \ like the bus with mud?  \nI encountered one of the most welcoming people in my\
  \ life in Ecuador. Everything there was colorful and cheerful, ranging from fruit,\
  \ vegetable, trousers and houses. I think this might be one of the happiest area\
  \ on earth or it simply doesn\u2019t belong to earth planet. But then, encountering\
  \ people eating raw worms directly pulled me out from my dream to reality. How could\
  \ this be possible? Those worms are still moving in your hands. Then you could either\
  \ slowly kill them by chopping off from their tails with your sharp teeth by small\
  \ bites, or trying to have minimum contact with the content and swallow them directly.\
  \ Either way, they are very nutritious and precious food in local area. \n\u2018\
  They are very juicy and extremely tasty!\u2019 said by a local.\nPeople not consuming\
  \ them often not because of ethical concern, or being scared of them, which might\
  \ be what us, as foreigner, would consider. While we always think of the future\
  \ or in a broad scale, like treating animal fairly or having sustainable development,\
  \ the local people would consider the present moment. Local eat them because it\
  \ tastes good but only buy them occasionally if they can afford. This is actually\
  \ one of the reasons why they can be constantly happy and contented as I observed.\
  \ \nThey do think about future, but it is not the priority because if without being\
  \ able to live well now. There will not be a happy future too.  If we work hard\
  \ to stay alive, active and try our best to be the person we want to be, we won\u2019\
  t regret whether the future is actually we thought about as in \u2018now\u2019.\
  \ We will then happy about our status in the future point of time. Or we can call\
  \ it 'present' at the future time point, because there is no \u2018future\u2019\
  \ but only \u2018now\u2019. \nLive long and prosper."
