Text: "...Since my very childhood, I have been dreaming to attend a dancing school,\
  \ especially in Latino style, as I always found it breathtaking and passionate.\
  \ Therefore, when we arrived to the place where dancing is as natural as breathing,\
  \ I decided that I would never lose the opportunity to learn from the \u201Cnative\
  \ dancers\u201D. Unfortunately, there were no free places in the majority of schools.\
  \ I have also heard that a great teacher came to give a master-class in one school\
  \ on a beautiful narrow street. I was so excited but again, I have had to enroll\
  \ a long time before his arrival. Being completely disappointed, I went with my\
  \ friend to a bar to rest and to enjoy the atmosphere of the night city, which was\
  \ full of fresh air after a hot day, a pleasant flavor of flowers, wine, and food.\
  \ We have met many people and made friends, as they were really open and welcoming.\
  \ One of them was a middle-aged man with a starkly expressed Hispanic appearance\
  \ and incendiary character. His name was Adrian and he was a tourist in San Telmo\
  \ just as we were. We were communicating, discussing and listening to a great calm\
  \ music in the background. I told him my story and about the miracle that brought\
  \ me to this amazing place. He was so impressed with my courage and proposed to\
  \ show me one of the most beautiful parts of Argentina\u2019s culture, which to\
  \ his mind was tango. We decided to meet next day at his office and you probably\
  \ will not believe but it was exactly that narrow street and a tiny dancing school.\
  \ I could not believe my eyes, I was dreaming about it so long and now this opportunity\
  \ came to me. However, it was far from the end of my surprise because that stranger,\
  \ that man from the bar was exactly that famous teacher that came some days before.\
  \ By casual coincidence of circumstances, just the same as I came to Argentina,\
  \ I met him and we have had an amazing day, full of dancing, learning, and fun,\
  \ communication with motivational, inspired and simply interesting people. That\
  \ case made me believe that everything is possible if we really want and search\
  \ for it. \nI  saw this in in films, read it in stories but now it was me, who could\
  \ hear every note of the breathtaking melody, to see the perfect movements of street\
  \ dancers and their passion, to wander around the city, full of old colonial buildings\
  \ and antique shops.  I have found myself in a completely different world. My soul\
  \ was resting in appeasement and pleasure. It was unbelievable but it was just the\
  \ beginning..."
