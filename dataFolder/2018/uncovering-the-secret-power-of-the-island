Text: "The air was hot and dry. Under a violent sunshine I hoped off the bus and started\
  \ on the path, lush with vegetation, to Cala Salada, one of Ibiza\u2019s most famous\
  \ coves.\n\nIn a few hundred meters all the hues of summer concentrated: the rocks,\
  \ ranging from ochre to orange to brick red, framed and connected, through a narrow\
  \ passage, the two sides of the beach; the vegetation, dense until the very surface\
  \ of the sea, glimmered of a light, intense green, as if it were trying to hold\
  \ the sunlight with all its strength; the cloudless sky was full of an almost solid\
  \ blue; and finally the water treasured all the colors of the surrounding elements,\
  \ reflecting them through its waves: from deep blue to the lighter and crystalline\
  \ shades of green, up to a touch of golden yellow, a gift from the rocks and the\
  \ rich seabed.\n\nI could have stayed there, in ecstasy, for eternity. \n\nA short\
  \ distance away, a boy, immobile, was staring at the infinite in front of himself.\
  \ Completely satisfied, he seemed one thing with the place. All of a sudden he turned\
  \ around and our eyes crossed. He was Italian, but living in Ibiza for some years.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI came here to become a DJ, but then I decided to remain because I fell\
  \ in love with the life of the place. I don\u2019t mean what usually tourists come\
  \ here for. Extreme fun, transgression, alcohol, drugs. That is NOT the real Ibiza.\
  \ Those excesses (and the industry behind them) often bring darkness and weakness,\
  \ which have nothing to do with the true essence of the island. Ibiza is energy.\
  \ Pure energy \". \n\nWithout even noticing, I found myself travelling along with\
  \ my new companion along a steep, sometimes dangerous path among hidden rocks and\
  \ inlets, while the sun fell steeply on the sea with an intensity I had rarely seen.\
  \ Then, in front of us, seating on apparently quiet waters, the guardian of Ibiza\u2019\
  s secret power: Es Vedr\xE0.\nA mysterious, rocky islet, with a dragon-headed profile,\
  \ completely uninhabited.\n\nBeyond the imaginary legends that described it as the\
  \ home of the sirens or part of the submerged city of Atlantis or the third magnetic\
  \ field on earth, the magic of that place was real: the red of the sunset had long\
  \ disappeared, but even in the darkness, those rocks and those waters emanated an\
  \ incredible energy, strong enough to make you lose orientation, such as crazy compasses\
  \ or birds. \nA sense of fulfillment pervading every fiber of your being. \nImpossible\
  \ to leave without an indelible memory and a will to return that cannot be silenced."
