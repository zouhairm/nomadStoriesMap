Text: "Fifteen years ago, the choice of a wealthy Pan-African Father to journey with\
  \ his only child, brought me to the riverine Ijaw town, the host of the only University\
  \ in the state and situated at Wilberforce Island.\nUnlike my very first time to\
  \ Amassoma from the capital city- Yenagoa that was a long tiring journey round the\
  \ island by water, my journey this time was a short peaceful ride that made me reflect\
  \ on the simple beauty of nature.\nThrough the winding path of the island decorated\
  \ at both sides with settlements, farmlands and mangrove forests all coloured green;\
  \ where untied hairdos of travelers are strewn by nature's wind and the grasses\
  \ at the way side bow in welcome as vehicles speed to their destinations.\nA prestigious\
  \ dignitary had linked the town to the city by road a few years after he established\
  \ the institution.\nAmassoma, one of the largest settlements in the Niger Delta\
  \ region of Nigeria. It developed a great deal with the establishment of the University.\
  \ The roads, constructed with interlocking blocks are mainly plied by motorcycles\
  \ and the houses are a mix of modern and ancient structures; a few mud houses still\
  \ stand tall amidst block houses. Unfortunately, a portion of the town's market\
  \ at the riverside recently burned down, a sad sight to behold as most sellers struggle\
  \ to start up business again.\nOver the years, I developed a desire for adventure\
  \ and my passion for writing intensified, so I returned with a bucket list in hand\
  \ and a soul ready to bask in the rich culture of the Ijaw people.\nWith a bag slung\
  \ across my shoulder bearing my camera, I walked to the river to check off an item\
  \ on my list. I followed the path where elderly women with wrappers tied tight at\
  \ their waist against the hem of a casual blouse, chattered noisily in Izon language\
  \ as they pounded boiled cassava in long wooden mortars.\nThe strong smell of ogogoro\
  \ diffused through the air and the common owigiri music tingled the ears of hearers\
  \ from a nearby bar.\nI approached the river, admiring the beautiful green of plantain\
  \ bunches at almost every shop and stopped at the pier as I looked at the beautiful\
  \ landscape, the graceful river that surrounds the island and separates it from\
  \ the town across, people paddling in canoes so far away they looked just like specks\
  \ on the horizon. \nI took a few pictures with my camera, placed it back in the\
  \ bag and kept it close by on the ground.\nLike a swimmer preparing for a swim-race,\
  \ I took a deep breath, exhaled and dived into the water."
