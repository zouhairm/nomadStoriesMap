Text: "After a blurry morning flight, my partner Chris and I received a bumpy landing\
  \ into Cairns. With a hopeful arrival to become certified divers, the glow of the\
  \ rainforest, the bat strewn, pink dusk and the hard showers crashing into the willowy\
  \ figs trees welcomed us to a stunning part of the world. \nTo me, the Great Barrier\
  \ Reef was something else. The world\u2019s oceans are home to over 370 species\
  \ of sharks, half of which occur in Australia, yes, you guessed it I have a fear\
  \ of sharks, which is a tough call when you want to be a diver. Suddenly, nerves\
  \ hit and it dawned on me -why was I going miles out to sea to get lost amongst\
  \ the deep of the largest living thing on earth? It\u2019s half the size of Texas\
  \ and goes deeper than 2000 metres and I was going in! \nOn our first day, we still\
  \ had training to do and my first jump into the water was full of daunt and determination,\
  \ it\u2019s always strange sinking on purpose and the facts about the dangers of\
  \ diving from the briefing rang in my ears.\nA challenging 4 dives later and we\
  \ had passed! My nerves had disintergrated and I couldn\u2019t be more proud to\
  \ be given the opportunity to get out onto Flynn Reef and navigate for the first\
  \ time without an instructor! \nIt had been a blissful lesson adapting to underwater\
  \ life and on our 5th dive we had more than adjusted. As we swam amongst the pure\
  \ and glorious wonders of the aquatic world, the oddities and beauty is something\
  \ undeniably magical. Just as I drifted in front, the coral walls became lost behind\
  \ me and the water seemed colder and far more vast in the distance, I turned to\
  \ find Chris, but was shocked to be met with a 2 metre grey reef shark drifting\
  \ above my head! I signalled shark and pointed in the direction where it was swimming\
  \ away from us. Then lost, we resurfaced, located the boat and descended once more\
  \ to make our way back. Once we\u2019d boarded the boat again and taken off gear,\
  \ I needed a moment to breath and reflect. I asked myself why I was afraid of such\
  \ a beautiful and natural wonder of the water that I saw gliding above me. Sharks\
  \ are older, wiser, graceful and more beautiful than anything I\u2019d seen before\
  \ in the wild. That shark taught me a very important life lesson that day. Face\
  \ your fears, you never know until you try and life is full of unexpected surprises\
  \ and even bigger ones if you give them the chance to unfold. I took a chance and\
  \ a shark shared it\u2019s habitat with me. Scuba diving is what I\u2019d describe\
  \ as a perfect balance of therapeutic adrenalin."
