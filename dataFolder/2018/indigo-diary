Text: "I was drawn to travelling since I got into the conscious age. \nI do not remember\
  \ when exactly it happened: after my thrilling summer camp in Greece, essay contest\
  \ winner trip to Toronto or volunteering work in Tokyo filled with most meaningful\
  \ connections. However, what I knew is that at some point it became my life aspiration\u2013\
  \ to move around and travel as much as I can.\nSo, let me get back to the point\
  \ where I, being completely lost in who I was and who I wanted to be, was bound\
  \ to fulfil a social duty and my parents\u2019 greatest desire - doing a university\
  \ degree in economy. Thus, I went for it. This happens when you want to be self-sufficient\
  \ and do things your own way, but at the same time have no idea how do you want\
  \ to do things your way. The only thing I knew by intuition is that I had to change\
  \ the surroundings, leave familiar behind. In that reality everything was set for\
  \ me whilst I knew I wanted to go into the world where nothing was set, thereby,\
  \ I still could get a chance in finding my own definition of me.\nWhat I was seeking\
  \ found me when my faculty collaborated with Portuguese Institute on a program which\
  \ would last for 2 years. I knew it was for me right away. \nOne day in a rural\
  \ town of Portugal the guy announced he was holding a talk about chakras. I got\
  \ interested in information I had zero knowledge on. He kept holding discussions\
  \ that after got accompanied by meditations every week. And it got to me, it felt\
  \ so right as if the missing puzzle I have been looking for finally was found. I\
  \ kept going religiously to all of the discussions and meditations, and an overwhelming\
  \ feeling of excitement kept growing more and more as if my whole being was approving\
  \ of all the new food for thoughts coming my way. \nThe thread of realizations kept\
  \ hitting me since that day and my journey towards healing began. Not knowing how\
  \ to love myself I got traumatized through the course of younger years and unconsciously\
  \ shielded myself from life in order to not get hurt. I discovered that I am so\
  \ much more than the definitions I gave myself and received from others. I found\
  \ myself amongst people with higher sensitivity and proneness to work with energy.\
  \ Moreover, I discovered I myself was one of such people. My conscious journey has\
  \ just begun and my path keeps unveiling at a high speed now.  i am aware that for\
  \ some this story might sound mystified but it is the realest and surely the last\
  \ thing I expected to ever happen to me."
