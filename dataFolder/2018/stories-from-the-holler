Text: "As we drove through the winding, narrow streets of rural Appalachia, I couldn\u2019\
  t believe what I was seeing.  There were houses in disrepair, stray dogs roaming\
  \ the dirt streets, and no signs of the life I came from just a few hours away.\
  \  \n\nWe reached our destination, an abandoned school, and a woman with a welcoming\
  \ smile greeted us.  Her nickname was Mama.  \u201CHow are y\u2019all doing?\u201D\
  \  Fine, we murmured, wondering what we would be doing during our three days of\
  \ service work.  \u201CWe\u2019re so glad to have you here.  C\u2019mon in.\u201D\
  \  She hugged each of us as we exited the van. \n\nThe water line from a major flood\
  \ stained and chipped the paint on the school wall, covering some of the names and\
  \ paintings depicting local history.  We would later add our names to the wall,\
  \ solidifying our bond with that place.\n\n\u201CWhen the coal mines stopped running,\
  \ the county shut down,\u201D Mama said as she showed us to our rooms.  \u201CThere\
  \ are no jobs here now.  The schools shut down, and some kids ride the bus over\
  \ two hours each day from the hollers to the nearest school.  You\u2019ll still\
  \ find the nicest people here, though.\u201D  Mama arranged for a bluegrass band\
  \ to play for us that first night.  The banjo, double bass, fiddle and guitars filled\
  \ the room with sweet music, sharing stories of local history, and of the hard working,\
  \ good-natured people.  \n\nThe houses told the saddest stories, though.\n\nOne\
  \ house we helped repair had a gaping hole in the side of it from a small electrical\
  \ fire.  The next house had a mold problem as a result of a water leak, and the\
  \ young boy who lived there was having respiratory problems.  My group worked on\
  \ another house installing siding.\n\nWhile taking a short break on our last day,\
  \ my group sat on the front porch watching two dogs wander down the unpaved road\
  \ searching for food, their rib cages sticking out awkwardly as they walked.  The\
  \ elderly man who lived in the house slowly opened the screen door to approach us.\
  \ He had five orange sodas cradled in his worn hands.  Without saying a word, he\
  \ handed each of us a soda.  He then walked back into the house, not to be seen\
  \ again. Our foreman told us that he was a retired army veteran.  That can of soda\
  \ was a small token of his appreciation\u2014perhaps the only way he could offer\
  \ his thanks.  \n\nIt\u2019s difficult to imagine that you could form a bond with\
  \ someone with whom you never speak, but I connected to that man through a can of\
  \ orange soda.  It\u2019s as if he knew that orange soda was my favorite."
