Text: "Dark blue melded with fiery orange as the sun set against a backdrop of trees.\
  \ The river below glowed. It was a kaleidoscope of colour just as Rodrigo had promised.\
  \ We watched the sun inch towards the river\u2019s horizon. Strangers really, but\
  \ a quick conversation on the street where I had been lining up my camera to accommodate\
  \ the town\u2019s three water towers had led to a tour around his gallery and a\
  \ day being guided by his photographic skill and local knowledge. The view we looked\
  \ at now had been captured by Rodrigo and published in a magazine. This sunset over\
  \ the Madeira River had been seen by thousands. It had given him the courage to\
  \ open the gallery and take many more shots of his home town; the river flowing\
  \ alongside the Brazilian rainforest was inspiration for most. Silent now, the river\
  \ flowed serenely to meet the great force of the Amazon some way ahead. Upstream\
  \ was the hydroelectric dam in its first stage of building. Here, the river was\
  \ broken and confused. Forced off its natural course and meander, the river was\
  \ being re-directed. Flooding had destroyed the bridge linking the two sides of\
  \ the river. The damage led to long delays as the morning commuter traffic edged\
  \ along an improvised bridge hastily erected by the army days before. The family\
  \ I stayed with had a Brazilian indifference to time and did not appear to be perturbed\
  \ by the delay. However, there was a flurry of exasperated sighs when they talked\
  \ of the dam taking away their long serving maid. She had left to take a better\
  \ paid job working there.\nI clutched the beaded necklace given as a gift from the\
  \ indigenous family Rodrigo had stopped to photograph earlier. He told me they had\
  \ lost their homes as the land once owned by them had been consumed by the river\u2019\
  s greedy flow. Mercury levels were their concern as the disrupted river was disturbing\
  \ toxins. Fears over the fish, their livelihood, were discussed. Language wasn\u2019\
  t needed to see the anger in the jerky hand movements as the elder pointed at the\
  \ river \u2013 once a benevolent friend but now a grasping foe.\nBack in town, a\
  \ power outage left us in darkness on the road where Rodrigo\u2019s gallery stood.\
  \ The government had given the go\u2013ahead to the dam after a huge electricity\
  \ failure in S\xE3o Paulo. The Amazon dam would provide S\xE3o Paulo, the powerhouse\
  \ of Brazil, with a reliable source at a cheap price. Not so for the people here,\
  \ their electricity and lives would remain as chaotic and disrupted as the flow\
  \ of the Madeira River."
