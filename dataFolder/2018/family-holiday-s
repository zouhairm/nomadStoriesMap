Text: "It was the night of my 18th birthday. White knuckled and stunned, I was standing\
  \ by a window in a hotel room in Las Vegas's \"New York New York\". My mother was\
  \ behind me on the floor with her knees up to her chest, whilst David sat opposite\
  \ her, staring at nothing.  All we could hear were the shrills coming from the hotel\u2019\
  s Big Apple rollercoaster. \n\nScrew this, I thought. With no sign of a re-match,\
  \ I turned on my heel and headed for the door. I wasn\u2019t going to be late for\
  \ Cirque Du Soleil. \n\n\u201CWhere do ya think you\u2019re going?\u201D David awakens.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI\u2019ve had enough.\u201D I snapped back. \n\nWeeks earlier my parents\
  \ had bought me an all paid expenses trip to America as a gift, promising that it\
  \ would be a trip of a lifetime. So far they\u2019ve kept their promise. Our family\
  \ holiday\u2019s are nothing short of an illusion; when we leave our home, we expect\
  \ our problems to be left behind only to arise in their borders. \n\nAs I stood\
  \ in Bellagio\u2019s foyer in line for the ticket box, I noticed an elderly woman\
  \ observing me from the other side of the room. She gave me a hopeful smile before\
  \ proceeding into the theatre, almost as if she understood my circumstances. Once\
  \ seated, I realised that everybody was sitting in groups. I guess these are the\
  \ types of events that you\u2019d only attend with loved ones. Ashamed, I felt the\
  \ heat of my emotions resurface. \n\n\u201CA friend told me this was overrated.\u201D\
  \ \n\nSitting next to me was the same woman from before.\n\n\u201CI hope your friend\
  \ is wrong.\u201D I mused back, glad to no longer look alone. \n\nHer name was Franca\
  \ and she was from San Francisco. In the half hour we had before the show, I learnt\
  \ a lot about her. She was open about her life and her intentions, she had nothing\
  \ to hide. Franca was about to embark on a year long solo world trip, a decision\
  \ that was decided after the divorce of her 25 year marriage. \n\n\u201CI see a\
  \ little bit of myself in you\u201D she said, tilting her head. \n\nThe lights were\
  \ dimming and the curtains were drawn back. We sat in the dark and admired the dancers\
  \ test the limitations of their bodies, oohing and ahhing.\n \nAs we walked out\
  \ of the foyer, we hugged each other goodbye.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ll need a tour guide\
  \ in Melbourne\u201D she says. \n\n\u201CYou got it\u201D I promise. \n\nI will\
  \ always remember Franca. To her acknowledgement or not, she had been the trip's\
  \ silver lining. She had come out of nowhere and instilled a sense of hope; showing\
  \ me an elegant version of reality. An acceptance that life is multidimensional,\
  \ that it can be both good and bad."
