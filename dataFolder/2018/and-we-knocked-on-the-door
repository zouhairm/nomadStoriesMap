Text: "We knocked on the wooden framed door, hoping someone would be at home. My father\
  \ looked up and down the narrow lane. It was the same even after thirty years. He\
  \ nodded approvingly at the tall set of brightly painted yellow walls of the surrounding\
  \ houses. After a few moments, a young girl stood before us, bemused at the sight\
  \ of the strangers. \n\u201CIs this the house of Goswami Prasad?\u201D My father\
  \ asked politely. \nThe girl paused and then called to her father. A middle-aged\
  \ man in a faded white t-shirt and dhoti approached the front door.\n\u201CKanhai?\
  \ Is that you?\u201D Goswami Prasad said with some recognition on his face. \nMy\
  \ father replied, \u201CYes, it is!\u201D\nThe front door opened onto a small marble-floored\
  \ courtyard. The steps in front of us led to a small prayer room with a temple dedicated\
  \ to Lord Krishna, the main deity worshipped in Vrindavan. \n\u201COffer your prayers\
  \ to Thakurji,\u201D Goswami Prasad said while directing us into their home. He\
  \ was referring to Lord Krishna\u2019s shine in the prayer room. We politely said\
  \ that our prayers to God had been offered for the day, not dwelling too much on\
  \ our religious differences. We seated ourselves in the living room, the men with\
  \ us and the women off to the kitchen. \n\u201CWould you like some tea?\u201D Goswami\
  \ Prasad asked. \nHe then proceeded to instruct his younger brother to go to the\
  \ nearby market to buy some tea. Goswami Prasad\u2019s wife came in holding a tray\
  \ of water. She handed me a disposable plastic cup that seemed to be filled with\
  \ what I thought tasted a lot like the shower water. Salty. I only took one sip\
  \ and placed the cup down on the table. My father and Goswami Prasad exchanged some\
  \ pleasantries and then he decided to head out, not wanting to intrude on their\
  \ afternoon any longer.  \n\u201CIs it normal to be offered water in plastic cups\
  \ in someone\u2019s home?\u201D I asked, genuinely interested in my father\u2019\
  s cultural background.\n\u201CThey probably didn\u2019t have any clean cups,\u201D\
  \ replied my father. I doubted it. \n\u201CAnd they couldn\u2019t make us a cup\
  \ of tea in the house either?\u201D \n\u201CThey probably didn\u2019t have time\
  \ to make tea since we came unannounced.\u201D \nI couldn\u2019t see how they didn\u2019\
  t have time to make tea in their kitchen, as one does when a guest comes to their\
  \ house. My father was not a stranger - he grew up with them.\n\u201COr is it because\
  \ you no longer are a Brahmin?\u201D \nI knew my father would never acknowledge\
  \ it, that he was being treated like outsider in his own hometown. Their supposed\
  \ hospitality seemed harmless, but I knew something wasn't right."
