Text: "I have always dreamed of traveling to far away places, experiencing their cultures\
  \ and seeing the beauty they have to offer first hand. This dream was my driving\
  \ force as I attended meetings with the chair of my department, my academic advisors,\
  \ the dean of my school, and filled out the mountains of paperwork needed for me\
  \ to study abroad in Florence, Italy. \n\nWhen I was accepted into the program,\
  \ I thought that this would be the most fulfilling year of my college experience.\
  \ One thing I could have never anticipated was losing my childhood best-friend,\
  \ Sophie, to an overdose in the weeks before. The loss left me devastated; even\
  \ as I boarded the plane and was filled with overwhelming excitement to finally\
  \ be traveling the world, I was grieving. As I took that long flight, I began to\
  \ wonder if going through with the trip had been a mistake, if perhaps I should\
  \ have stayed home to finish my senior year. Then something amazing happened; when\
  \ we were circling over Florence to land and I saw those terra cotta roofs I began\
  \ to really feel wonder.\n\nEverything about the city was new: the language, the\
  \ food, the pace of life. Even the sunlight was different, streaming down more golden\
  \ and bright than I had ever seen in New England. It was awe inspiring in a way\
  \ that made it almost impossible to feel the sadness. And within the first week\
  \ I found my favorite place in the world, the abbey of San Miniato al Monte. The\
  \ abbey is an ancient, peaceful place, up one of the steepest hills I have ever\
  \ climbed, with sweeping views of the city. I would walk a mile, climbing hundreds\
  \ of stairs, visiting time and again to take photos of the beauty, sit in the pews\
  \ and speak to Sophie, and to just absorb the tranquility. \n\nIt was such a healing\
  \ experience. That place in its unyielding presence and serenity helped piece back\
  \ together my broken heart in a way I never thought possible. Of course there was\
  \ so much more that happened in my time there - fun outings with friends, trips\
  \ to other cities, celebrating my twenty-first birthday - but none of these compare\
  \ to what San Miniato gave me. The last thing I expected after that crushing summer\
  \ was to not only find peace with what happened, but also to discover a new-found\
  \ passion for travel and the way it can heal your soul. I returned home at the end\
  \ of the semester healthier and happier than I had ever been. In the four short\
  \ months I lived there, Florence became my home, and I know that I will go back\
  \ to walk those steps again."
