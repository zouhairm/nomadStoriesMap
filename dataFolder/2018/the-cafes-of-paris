Text: "Dear friends,\n     Once upon the time, a French girl has introduced me to\
  \ the art of leisurely drinking among the sidewalk caf\xE9s of Paris.  It seems\
  \ a good time now to return to Paris (when is it not a good time to return to Paris?)\
  \ to visit some of the caf\xE9s where I had spent many a romantic time in my youth.\
  \ \n     In the 17th century, with the spread of the Arabic taste for coffee all\
  \ over Europe, the caf\xE9s of Paris offered a warm and cosy alternative to the\
  \ often dark and cold residential hotel of that time.  Indeed, one can trace the\
  \ history of Paris and sometimes of the world through its caf\xE9s.   \n     Revolutions\
  \ were plotted by men like Lenin or Robespierre in Paris caf\xE9s.  The Procope\
  \ on rue de l'Ancienne Comedie has been around since 1686.  It was almost 100 years\
  \ old when it received Benjamin Franklin and Voltaire.  It later claimed a few revolutionaries,\
  \ Robespierre, Danton, Marat and even Napoleon among its customers. \n     A new\
  \ artistic movement later known as Impressionism was, according to historian Roger\
  \ Shattuck, \"the first artistic movement entirely organized in caf\xE9s.\"  Unfortunately,\
  \ the old Monmartre caf\xE9s where Manet and Renoir once held court have long since\
  \ disappeared with time. \n     Many authors used to write their novels in Paris\
  \ caf\xE9s.  Hemingway wrote his stories in the Closerie des Lilas which, in the\
  \ 17th century, had been a lilac-shaded country tavern.  The Coupole, once an old\
  \ brasserie, had served as home to Henry Miller, Lawrence Durrell and Samuel Beckett.\
  \  Caf\xE9 de la Mairie was William Faulkner's favorite drinking place and Djuna\
  \ Barnes also set several scenes in \"Nightwood\" there. \n     At the crossroad\
  \ outside Paris' oldest church St Germain-des-Pr\xE9s, Baron Haussman cut a boulevard\
  \ through here during the Second Empire and in came what many would rate as the\
  \ most famous caf\xE9s in Paris: les Deux Magots (1875) which is situated just across\
  \ the old church and derives its curious name from two large Chinese statues that\
  \ sit high up at its center.\n     A cult among Japanese tourists, les Deux Magots's\
  \ price list also makes you feel like you are in Tokyo.  But as one sits on its\
  \ terrace, looking out to the church across the blooming flowers during a spring\
  \ sunset, one can hardly help but feeling that, after all, this is the place to\
  \ be to watch life passing by...  \n    Just like Hemingway once remarked, if you\
  \ are lucky enough to have lived in Paris, then wherever you go for the rest of\
  \ your life, it stays with you! \nLe"
