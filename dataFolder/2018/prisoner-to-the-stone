Text: "\u201CHurry up! You don\u2019t have to stop and take pictures of every little\
  \ thing!\u201D, the scold was loud and mortifying. Was I on holiday with my father?\
  \ English speakers in earshot looked at me with equal shock. He had awoken in a\
  \ dark mood, one I was becoming more and more familiar with.  I suggested we have\
  \ a couple espressos and linger over breakfast. We were tired. Foot-weary and worn\
  \ out from constant bickering. Not the reasons most people come home exhausted from\
  \ a honeymoon. I stood still for a minute, in the second city on our Tuscan itinerary.\
  \ Florence seduced me. I had never experienced her medieval beauty before.  Everything\
  \ was captivating to me and I wanted to bask in her glory. But we were running late.\
  \ The museum was about to open and we had to beat the rush. I apologized. We entered\
  \ the Galleria dell\u2019Accademia.\n\n One of the reasons I thought I\u2019d fallen\
  \ in love with my husband was for his love of art. His father had been an artist.\
  \ He painted and sculpted and my husband had the same eye for design. I assumed\
  \ it would be something we\u2019d forever enjoy together. But after all of the museums\
  \ and buildings of interest it became apparent he was a fan of his fathers work,\
  \ and his father's hero, Michelangelo, and not much else. Now Michelangelo in and\
  \ of himself is a fantastic alter to worship at. I had just assumed the love was\
  \ broader. As we made our way through the various displays of ancient pottery it\
  \ was very apparent what it was all building up to. Many tourists just blasted right\
  \ past it all in an eager scurry to see the grand finale. My husband wanted to be\
  \ one of them. In huge contrast, I wanted to savor everything but I could see his\
  \ discontent. As I marinated in the Italian master's work, I was becoming the master\
  \ of keeping the peace. I knew he wanted to see Michelangelo so I hurried along.\
  \ Maybe this would make him happy. We entered the Hall of the Prisoners. Some highly\
  \ defined, others still enslaved to the stone that shackled them. Bodies pulsated\
  \ in the rock. Were they stuck or simply unfinished? Was that their creator's intention?\
  \ Did they know any different?  \u201C I don\u2019t want to go over there, too many\
  \ people.\u201D He was looking over at the David. My husband was ready to leave\
  \ without a closeup of Him. I could feel the chains strain as I hinted at my desire\
  \ to see it and the pullback was hard and fast. A tempest brewed once again. Was\
  \ I stuck or unfinished? I squeezed out of my shackles and turned to walk toward\
  \ the David. I had to find out."
