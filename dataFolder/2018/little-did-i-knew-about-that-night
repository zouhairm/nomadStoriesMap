Text: The last thing I expected was few years back while I was traveling in my country
  the city called Rajasthan. a very interesting place after spending few days coming
  back from that place waiting on station for my train and I was with my grandmother
  she was not feeling good her health was bad he she feel asleep and I saw that place
  was not safe and it was night though but no so late people around me waiting enjoying
  as few had happy faces few had sad faces it was whole new atmosphere with mixed
  feeling and scenes which were unexpected for me. Few boys were there and they were
  about to leave but a small 11 years old girl sitting there which was me found out
  how a place can have so much to say and do at a same time life is same but place
  was risky the place where few bunch of boys coming towards me and they saw Me and
  felt I. Was alone though I was with my grandmother they felt I was very small so
  they thought they can kidnap me this was the first time ever I felt risky and my
  journey to my way back home could have delayed or would have never happened this
  I could have never expected but I just prayed and they just saw my face and what
  came to their minds I couldn't imagine they left the place and I heard one guy saying
  leave it she is a small girl..... Phewww thank God I came back home safely this
  was the last thing I ever expected just to even see or feel the fear of something
  happening to ourselves when we are far away from our parents and parents waiting
  for their child to be back home soon alot I have learned that made me lil more mature
  to understand and know the place and situations how happy things can be turned out
  to be sad or sometimes even dangerous still this was the last thing I Was expecting
  with me was even having that fearing of having dangerous around me, thank God my
  prayers got answered at the right time. Though my trip was just amazing. I thought
  of writing something which I experienced while I was traveling and was very young
  at Same time I love to experience different places but what I love to experience
  more it the atmosphere of that place which while traveling gives me new experience
  and adds up something which I can share or write about for me while traveling the
  most important thing is to explore the place and it's atmosphere well I am glad
  that I could share something which I experienced when I was a kid. Alot more stories
  I can go on writing if I get alot of new places to explore.
