Text: "Sitting in cramped quarters on the first leg of my journey, a 13-hour flight\
  \ to Seoul, gave me plenty of time to reflect. The Last Thing I Expected from my\
  \ trip to Costa Rica is that I would be flying half way around the world for a first\
  \ date with a retired Australian firefighter expat living in Bali. Lazily floating\
  \ in the pool of my compound, unbeknownst to me, is where this tall blonde auzzie\
  \ first spotted me. There for New Year\u2019s I stayed in this quaint surf town\
  \ while we struck up an affable friendship. At the time, I was in the end stages\
  \ of a relationship so I kept him at bay. He left early one morning for Panama before\
  \ I was up to bid good-bye. He found me on FB and so began a long distance friendship\
  \ winning his heart with a poem. For the next year and a half, every message I awoke\
  \ to was \u2018When are you coming to Bali\u2019. It took a death in our family\
  \ for me to book my flights. No \u2018what ifs\u2019 for me. The plan was to spend\
  \ 3 weeks with him, basically, a stranger. To appease my folks I had my back up\
  \ plan should things turn south and I do not mean Australia. Alternate lodging and\
  \ tours logged in my iPhone. He was there at 2 am to greet me at the airport, standing\
  \ tall and ruggedly handsome amongst the crowd of locals. Once I spotted him, my\
  \ fear that he would not show vanished as my second wind travel euphoria kicked\
  \ in. We spent the next 3 weeks travelling this vibrant, lush island by motorbike.\
  \ The advantage; you engage one on one with some of the friendliest people I have\
  \ ever met. Bali, the name alone evokes memories of emerald hills, tranquil sunsets\
  \ and ancient temples. Days began with a hot flat white java. Pay with little money\
  \ not big. From Kerobokan its west to Pura Luhur Uluwatu Temple, a stunning cliff\
  \ top location to witness the Kecak show and dodge sunglass-swiping monkeys while\
  \ watching the sun go down over the Indian Ocean. Then East to Ubud, known as the\
  \ craft villages, to visit Monkey Forest, for only Rp 30,000, Starbucks beside the\
  \ mesmerizing Lotus Pond Pura Taman Saraswati Temple; dedicated to the Hindu Goddess\
  \ Saraswati and stroll to Ubud Palace to enjoy the beauty of the Balinese dancers.\
  \ Head north to the awe-inspiring Tegallalang Rice Terraces. The dramatic terraced\
  \ fields undulate with the curve of hillsides. Truly, a breath-taking scene on your\
  \ way to view majestic Mount Batur, take a jacket. Pick up some Thai fisherman\u2019\
  s pants as souvenirs for yoga. Back to Denpasar airport and all too soon, it is\
  \ time to say Sampai jumpa."
