Text: "My trip in Morocco started with Leila, who was new to Couchsurfing but sounded\
  \ legit judging by her profile and messages \u2013 and we got along instantly. She\
  \ had a bubbling personality with a rebellious edge, wanted to know more about foreign\
  \ cultures and travel.\n\nWhen her parents asked me how I knew Leila, I didn't know\
  \ what to say \u2013 would they get worried, if I said I'd never actually met her?\
  \ This was a country with some conservative values after all, although cited one\
  \ of the more liberal Arab countries. Later I found out they were rather liberal-minded\
  \ themselves; Leila's mother even drank the occasional whisky at home, which I had\
  \ thought was a complete taboo for Muslims.\n\nLeila's passionate rants about life\
  \ as a young female Arab opened up a whole unknown world to me. Despite her parents'\
  \ open-mindedness, she couldn't help feeling societal pressures to behave 'appropriately'.\
  \ The fact that she plays gigs in bars late at night is seen as bad behaviour for\
  \ a young woman, making her unsuitable for a wife. Dating isn't allowed, let alone\
  \ sleeping in the same room with the opposite sex unless you're married. Still,\
  \ Leila's rebellious nature had not only caused trouble but also helped her follow\
  \ her passion for music.\n\nMaybe Leila's Western dressing style was partly why\
  \ people kept asking us whether we were sisters, though her curly hair and slightly\
  \ darker complex seemed to have nothing to do with my Northern European white skin\
  \ and then blonde dreadlocks! Even Leila's childhood friend who knew all of her\
  \ family asked her whether I was some cousin he had not met before. We did admittedly\
  \ have a lot in common despite our seemingly different cultures and became close\
  \ friends as the days went by. So eventually, we started calling each other 'my\
  \ long lost twin!' since everyone else seemed to see us that way anyway.\n\nLeila\
  \ hosted me first in her parents' home in Rabat and again in her shared flat in\
  \ Casablanca, and organised a friend of hers to host me in Tangier. We became close\
  \ friends and still keep in touch eight years later. Yet my 'twin' was nowhere near\
  \ being the only local to welcome me with open arms; I would later end up sleeping\
  \ in a zoo and being invited to a wedding in the Saharan desert, among another dozen\
  \ places around Morocco. The kindness and hospitality I experienced in Morocco really\
  \ taught me a lot about sharing good things with each other, regardless of how little\
  \ you have \u2013 a lesson I think we could benefit a lot from in Western societies."
