Text: "It was before Happy New Year, I was in Vienea for one day . I so like this\
  \ city , so beautiful and interesting. And maybe at evening I went to some park\
  \ in center . Before I came I saw some signboard that park open until 17 pm. So\
  \ but inside we\u2019re a lot of people, so I didn\u2019t care and came in. I was\
  \ sitting near the small pool and in one moment I realized that I\u2019m here alone\
  \ . So I went to check gates, but all was closed. It like movie, alone at home ,\
  \ but I was alone inside closed park. Second problem was that in one hour I need\
  \ went to bus station to move in another country. So I needed hurry up . First what\
  \ I did , I\u2019m cried and tried find some way , I was scared. After I made decision\
  \ that I need do something. I went to gate and started shout - I need help!!!\n\
  All people just went away and laughed.\nTwo girls came to gate and asked me about\
  \ what happend , I explained and said - Can you find on website of this park , number\
  \ of somebody and call. They tried find but nothing . After maybe 20 minuets , I\
  \ was so nervous and fed up and said - Can you call to police. First they heisted\
  \ and said that haven\u2019t money for it. I was astonished. \nAnd we saw one policemen\u2019\
  s car and they called them. \nPolicemen first said me - you are victory!!\nAh yes\
  \ so funny.\nAnd one old man came to me , and said one door was opened, I said it\u2019\
  s impossible. \nAnd after 5 m he came in park , and we together with police officers\
