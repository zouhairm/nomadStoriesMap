Text: "\u201CI was nearly 8 years old when I woke up in the morning; it was 5 o\u2019\
  clock, and the air was full of planes. We were very afraid. The radio stopped, there\
  \ were no newspaper reports and we couldn\u2019t get any information about what\
  \ was happening - the silence lasted for five days. We thought it\u2019s war, now\
  \ it\u2019s war.\u201D\n\nIt was clear to see that Co\u2019s memories were still\
  \ just as vivid in her mind 75 years on. I had moved to Groningen a couple of weeks\
  \ beforehand, studying journalism for an Erasmus exchange. When my professor first\
  \ assigned us the task of interviewing an elderly person about memories from their\
  \ youth, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect. Co continued, her voice faltering:\n\
  \n\u201CMy teacher was killed by the soldiers. He was 33 I think, a young man. My\
  \ parents sheltered me from the worst things, but I will always remember the constant\
  \ unsafe feeling that my father could be taken away. In 1944 people came from the\
  \ big towns to the villages and were lying in the streets. They were famished. They\
  \ were so hungry, it was horrible. The cities took the most damage, around 270 buildings\
  \ were destroyed in Groningen. The villages did not change much, but the villagers\
  \ were tired, broken. There were clouds because of the cannons.\u201D \n\nCo\u2019\
  s story transformed the youthful city into a battleground. As I cycled back over\
  \ the cobblestones into the Grote Markt, I didn\u2019t just see the lively stalls\
  \ and laughing students. I could envision the setting for the fierce Battle of Groningen.\
  \ The sky was swarming with thunderous planes, and paratroopers rained down towards\
  \ the small, copper-toned houses below. The canals swirled with blood while acrid\
  \ smoke rose up through the air, with buildings smouldering throughout the main\
  \ square.\n\nThe connection between the local buildings and the history books is\
  \ palpable, with bullet holes and slogans still recorded on the walls. Six stone\
  \ hands reach up towards the overcast sky as a tribute to the lost Jewish. The sculpture\
  \ was never finished, with a space for a seventh hand standing empty between the\
  \ grey palms. While some signs remain, many are hidden. The trenches in the leafy\
  \ Noorderplantsoen are gone - the Dutch have always excelled at reclaiming land.\
  \ Instead of smoke and debris, Groningen now has the cleanest air of any of the\
  \ big Dutch cities. Instead of tanks, there are bikes \u2013 hundreds of them. However,\
  \ once you start looking, the history and stories are everywhere, embedded in the\
  \ city walls."
