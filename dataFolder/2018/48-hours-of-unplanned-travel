Text: "48 hours of unplanned travel, yet we were a willing crew of three and two cast\
  \ members. We left our office in the Vaal to rush to Midrand to get instructions\
  \ to begin our challenge. Our paper was written (Genre-Period piece / Element-Ring\
  \ / Dialogue-Unbelievable), we couldn't believe it given the torture of renting\
  \ out costume and gear on a 0 budget, especially PERIOD PIECE. We spent a night\
  \ at a convenient store, researching gear and costume houses, while writing the\
  \ script for a two-hander episode we were looking forward to shooting the next day.\n\
  \nWe were lucky to get a rental facility that was fond of the 48 hour film project,\
  \ which gave us a superb discount and that encouraged us to look forward to our\
  \ day in the rural area between Gauteng and the North West Provinces,  a place where\
  \ Lisa, our actress used to call home growing up. The rehearsal drive we had was\
  \ one creative and memorable in our career phase. Production was successful and\
  \ everybody excited  and then it was a wrap and all paperwork signed. However, Lisa\
  \ got too excited! Who wouldn\u2019t to catch up with family and reunite with old\
  \ friends? Party over, as we had to begin post-production, but first, we had to\
  \ return  rental house's  accouterments for us to get to the edit suite! We literally\
  \ had 2 hours to pack, exit Forchville, and rush to Germiston, as they closed at\
  \ 6PM, yeah that\u2019s doable; except, Lisa has vanished in an area we are  unfamiliar\
  \ with and all phones are mute, since silent on set is required. We had to decide\
  \ between waiting for her to return then pay extra fees for another day or we proceed\
  \ without her, making it to the rental house on time and without penalties.\n\n\
  We left Forchville in a rush to make it to Germiston and then proceeded in the same\
  \ rush to get to Vaal to begin editing, we seated throughout post-production counting\
  \ down to the end of our 48 hours while now and then giving a glimpse to the online\
  \ platforms to check how other teams were holding up.Walking outside Africa mall\
  \ fulfilled,made me appreciate the skills  I possess by being deadline driven and\
  \ being surrounded by a disciplined team. Especially after a decision that pushed\
  \ me to the edge pushed me to rejoice in the 48 hours of unplanned travel, yet we\
  \ are a willing crew of three and one cast member.\n\nAs we leave the mall,back\
  \ to our office to celebrate that we managed to deliver our film on time, we discovered\
  \ that Lisa got engaged to her teen-hood sweetheart, during the time she was awol.\
  \ #Happy Travel"
