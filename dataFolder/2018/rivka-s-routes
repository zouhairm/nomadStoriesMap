Text: "The first time I ever traveled on air plane was also the first time I ventured\
  \ to Israel. My rabbi and my friend really encouraged me to attend the trip, I thought\
  \ it would be really boring because israel is viewd as a place of religious observance\
  \ and virture. \n\nWhen I arrived there after a long 13hrs plane ride It was a very\
  \ religious atmosphere. Attebding seminary was cooler that what I thought i could\
  \ be. At night yerusleam really came to life!  The music , open markets at night,\
  \ the chatter in the streets was all so vibrant and overwheleming a once. \n\nI\
  \ learned how to heckle various prices to what I was willing to pay. Heckleing is\
  \ like being apart of an auction with the guy at the potium that starts talking\
  \ super fast. It was an adenline rush so funny because the shop keeper is speaking\
  \ broken english yet you the comsumer are speaking your native tounge and so many\
  \ arm gestures are flying ...crazy stuff in the open markets. \n\nAnyways, while\
  \ attending seminary i met an extended portion of my family i never knew I had.\
  \ I never expected to run in to my family acriss the globe."
