Text: "Falling through a questionably clean glass was the object of my desire, the\
  \ prize of my years of learning, longing, and lusting. To say I\u2019d spent a year\
  \ studying Chinese in Beijing only to buy a bag of tea would be a bit glib, but\
  \ I won\u2019t say it\u2019s untrue.\nI don\u2019t exactly know what is so compelling\
  \ about drinking tea. It\u2019s simple, yet elegant, like the subtle bounce of a\
  \ tree\u2019s leaves riding the waves of a breeze.\nBack in the United States, I\
  \ developed a taste for Chinese green tea; my favorite was the relatively rare Anji\
  \ White. I obsessed over Anji White tea. I drank it every day. I gave it to friends\
  \ as birthday presents. I\u2019d even written poetry about it.\nAfter leaving school\
  \ in Beijing, I traveled to Anji county - the origin of Anji White tea - and found\
  \ the massive four square block radius of tea stores known as \u201CAnji White Tea\
  \ City\u201D. I approached a middle-aged, heavyset Chinese man smoking a cigarette.\
  \ He had dark skin and darker eyes; his face sunk under the weight of his ordinariness.\n\
  \u201CI\u2019m looking for some Anji White. You have any?\u201D I asked.\nHe laughed.\
  \ \u201CI sure do.\u201D\nHe reached his hands inside a giant bag, cupped them together,\
  \ scooped up a heap of dried leaves, and shoved them under my nose. The scent hit\
  \ immediately; I nearly cried.\n\u201CCan we drink some?\u201D I asked.\nHe pulled\
  \ out a rusty stool from underneath a rusty table, grabbed a handful of tea, and\
  \ threw it into a murky glass.\n\u201CAnji White is my favorite,\u201D I said. \u201C\
  I drink this all the time back in the US.\u201D\n\u201CMine, too,\u201D he replied.\
  \ \u201CI drink two liters every day.\u201D\n\u201CTwo liters?\u201D I said in my\
  \ best politely shocked voice. \u201CThat\u2019s impressive.\u201D\nWe spent 30\
  \ minutes talking; he\u2019s an Anji native, has hand-picked this tea every year\
  \ for 24 years, he\u2019s happy he doesn\u2019t work in an office, his daughter\
  \ just got married to a police officer, and he thinks my Chinese is amazing (Chinese\
  \ people are masters at lying about my Chinese speaking abilities).\nI told him\
  \ about my travels around China. I told him about tea culture in the US. And I told\
  \ him how drinking tea with him was a dream of mine.\nHe laughed. \u201CI dream\
  \ of going to the US one day. Maybe when I do, YOU can drink tea with ME.\u201D\n\
  I smiled. \u201CThat's my new dream.\u201D\nWe were two commoners coming from opposite\
  \ sides of the world, from opposite cultural spectrums, and we barely spoke a common\
  \ language. But beyond those hurdles, beyond the web of differences, we quickly\
  \ bonded.\nBecause that\u2019s the power of tea.\nSimple, yet elegant\u2026 like\
  \ leaves riding the breeze."
