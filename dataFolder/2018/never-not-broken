Text: "This is a story about scale, about planning, and about how you can be completely\
  \ wrong and still have a life-changing experience.\n\nIn the early days of 2017,\
  \ my friend Katie and I were lucky. We stumbled upon tickets to Iceland for $199,\
  \ round trip, and pulled the trigger immediately. Impulsively. We had no plans,\
  \ no money, and were about to travel around an extremely expensive country. Some\
  \ furious searching helped us decide that we would spend the $70 on a checked bag,\
  \ pack our own freeze-dried food and sleeping bags, then we would wear as many layers\
  \ on the plane as publicly acceptable. We decided to rent a regular van instead\
  \ of a camper van, because it would save us hundreds of USD.\n\nIt seemed like a\
  \ ridiculous plan for a country that many describe as alien, but we were confident\
  \ that we would be alright. We gave ourselves 12 days to get all the way around\
  \ the famous Ring Road, thinking that this would still be a stretch if the weather\
  \ took a turn for the worse. \n\nSo, when we landed, we immediately made our way\
  \ down the check list of necessary destinations, hastily bypassing ones we thought\
  \ we had no time for. And then we were done... In two and a half days. \n\n\"Crap,\"\
  \ we thought. \"This country is tiny!\"\n\nWith ten days to spare, and our fear,\
  \ as well as our sense of urgency entirely gone, we decided to drive the ring road\
  \ a second time. Much more slowly and deliberately this time. We stopped more often,\
  \ and for longer. We spent the early morning hours meditating or dipping into one\
  \ of the many geothermal pools throughout the country. And we met locals, Americans,\
  \ Europeans, and even some people from our own office who were on the first leg\
  \ of their honeymoon. It seemed we each had the same slow, meandering path, and\
  \ would meet each other again at every hot spring along the way. No need to make\
  \ plans, we all had the same idea.\n\nWe exchanged travel hacks with the travelers,\
  \ while the locals helped us dissect the intricacies, and simplicities, of the Icelandic\
  \ language (The names of places are basically just their descriptions), educated\
  \ us on the delicacies (highly recommend the hot dogs, and you have to try the fermented\
  \ shark, but only once. Once is enough for a lifetime), and even traveled with us\
  \ because they had the day off.\n\nEventually, however, we finished our second revolution\
  \ around the planet called Iceland, and as we took our last look around we knew\
  \ that we had been changed forever by the people, the place, and especially our\
  \ own poor planning."
