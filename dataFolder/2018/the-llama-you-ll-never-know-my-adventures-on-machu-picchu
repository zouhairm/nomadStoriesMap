Text: "Hiking Machu Picchu is a never-again opportunity. Capturing an award-winning\
  \ photo on said Ancient Wonder is, too. Or at least I think it would be. As I framed\
  \ the most amazing shot I\u2019d ever seen, a ten-year-old boy shoved me out of\
  \ his way to poke a stick at a llama.\n\nForlorn after five hours of intense hiking\
  \ that morning, I glared at the boy\u2019s parents, and sought out another llama\
  \ to grace me with his buck-toothed grin.  No llamas. My luck held.\n\nThe day had\
  \ started with my usual form. After 20 minutes of hiking down a mountain in the\
  \ dark, I had realized that my ticket was back in the hostel. \n\nAfter adding another\
  \ two miles round trip to retrieve my ticket, I grumpily hiked upward for twice\
  \ as long as the guidebooks had predicted. It was definitely the necessary photos\
  \ making me stop so often, though, not the life-sucking altitude.\n\nHiking with\
  \ a massive backpack the day prior was catching up to me, but I was poor, so the\
  \ hiking was my only option.\n\nBut I had triumphed! \n\nThen, I looked up.\n\n\
  The ruins were perched atop another peak. My body screamed for rest, but I wasn\u2019\
  t about to waste all that money and effort to stop now. I slugged back some water\
  \ and went through the gates.\n\nHikers coming down from the Inca Trail saw me along\
  \ the path. \u201CHave you seen the Sun Gate?\u201D\n\nUnable to speak, I shook\
  \ my head and guzzled down water I\u2019d purchased for a rich man's fee.\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s just a twenty minute hike and absolutely worth it.\u201D\n\nThat didn\u2019\
  t sound so bad.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019ll get the most awesome views ever.\u201D\n\n\
  I like awesome views.\n\nMy life was probably over anyway, so what the heck? I kept\
  \ climbing.\n\nFast forward two hours and I\u2019d managed to miss my entry to the\
  \ mountain peak I\u2019d paid extra to climb. I might have been okay with that.\
  \ I probably couldn't climb it anyway. Of course, I climbed a taller peak instead.\n\
  \nTen straight hours of hiking on just a Snickers bar and a few bottles of water,\
  \ and I had survived. I was half-blind and in more pain than when I ran the Chicago\
  \ Marathon, but I was alive.\n\nI\u2019ll never forget watching gray chinchillas\
  \ scramble across rocks, or the condors that flew overhead. The visions of stones\
  \ carried on ancient backs to the mountain top will always be with me. But I\u2019\
  ll never know what it\u2019s like to capture the world\u2019s most amazing photo\
  \ of a llama.\n\nI\u2019m not bitter. I just have a new life mission: to find that\
  \ kid again someday and unleash my own child on him while he\u2019s angling for\
  \ the photo that would redefine photo-journalism forever."
