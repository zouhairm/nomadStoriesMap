Text: I was in dehradun, all lost and beggared due to my hasty plan. I was roaming
  around that city with covetous eyes when I found messy path, all covered with bush,
  near a cricket ground. That byway was so different and bewitching, I by-myself moved
  to chase my curiosity which was behind that byway. I made my passage through the
  bush carefully. I was slowly and steadily feeling the gush around me. I was little
  scared and little fired up. Second by second everything around me started increasing,
  my curiosity, that bush, those breeze, on other hand my heart and mind was in battle
  where my mind was forcing me to step back and my heart was pushing me to the edge.
  Finally by removing that last bush I reached the edge. May be the edge of the world,
  my world. A beautiful curvy transparent river at the core of the unknown greeny
  backwoods. Everything around me was so fresh and real. I was far way from the engaged
  and nasty world, no honk from traffic, no rush for obligation, just me at the shore
  of river with that peaceful noise of jungle. My heart was nagging from happiness.
  I want to show this part of our world to every desirable person may be with the
  help of my words.
