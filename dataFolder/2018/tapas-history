Text: "After we had arrived in Madrid, Spain, we wanted to explore and find out more\
  \ about the Tapas culture along with what makes people eat so late in Spain and\
  \ go from Tapas bar to Tapas Bar, or as they call it: \"Salir de Tapas\". Soon after,\
  \ we had blended in with the people bar-hopping around us, and ended up experiencing\
  \ the sense and smells of the old center city streets in Madrid at night, the night\
  \ mist and early winter March dry air wind sliding through our faces, until we noticed\
  \ a tapas bar called: La Posada del Le\xF3n de Oro, located in La Calle Cava Baja\
  \ 12. \nRemember, we only had in mind a night out to try tapas with the locals,\
  \ but encountered this boutique/tapas bar that was inside one of the oldest buildings\
  \ in La Calle Cava Baja street in Madrid! The building dates back to the 19th century\
  \ and displays where wine and food supplies were kept through a \"see-through\"\
  \ floor. \nI have to admit, it was an excellent combination of modern and old architectural\
  \ charm inside the bar. This tapas bar is also a hotel that houses a very sophiscated\
  \ and chic flair to it, kind of what you would expect at a boutique hotel but just\
  \ in the Center of Madrid, Spain. \nWe even went on a little tour of this hotel\
  \ to explore its hidden treasures and were charmed by its character and unassuming\
  \ exterior. Then after we spoke to the staff looked around and took some pictures,\
  \ we asked for the menu, we ordered the traditional Spanish Tapas staples:\nJam\xF3\
  n Serrano de Bellota (cured Spanish ham), Sangria (Spanish wine with fruits) & Patatas\
  \ Bravas (spicy potatoes), with the exception of the Patatas Bravas & the Sangria,\
  \ the Jam\xF3n wasn't freshly cut.\nWith this disappointment, we decided to leave\
  \ and go \"de Tapas\" around the city, we made new friends, tried new tapas, and\
  \ along the way, we discovered a couple of things in this mini adventure:\nThe true\
  \ meaning of: \"Salir de Tapas\" is not only to enjoy delicious food, but to share,\
  \ meet, explore, and experience being alive. See, we had missed the whole point\
  \ of what this activity was all about, its not just about the food alone, its the\
  \ whole package that makes it worth your while, when you enter a tapas bar, you'll\
  \ notice people sitting up close, drinking, eating, smiling and exhausting the night\
  \ well into the early morning without a single care in the world. I believe this\
  \ is the Spanish way of recharging their \"batteries\" to \"attack\" the next day.\
  \ And this is repeated everyday of the year where its second nature to the Spanish."
