Text: "It was 11 pm on a hot December night, my body gently bounced as the plane wheels\
  \ hit the tarmac. I felt my heart smile and in that moment of impact tears began\
  \ to flood my eyes. \n\nOnce I walked out of the airport doors I was immediately\
  \ overwhelmed by the heat and the number of faces, my eyes scanned the crowd, and\
  \ I was relieved when I locked eyes with my friend. We were soon in his car driving\
  \ down a bustling highway, young men running in front of cars like gazelles on safari.\
  \ The medians were littered with limbs, young men and women lounging and laughing.\
  \ It was after midnight by now, well after my bedtime had I been at home, yet there\
  \ were swarms of people playing on the highway. \u201CWhat the hell are these guys\
  \ doing?!\u201D I asked my friend, he chuckled and said, \u201CWelcome to Lagos.\u201D\
  \n\nWe passed a few hours in his home with the company of his wife and delicious\
  \ food before we were on our way to the local bus station. I stood in awe as I saw\
  \ young men loading luggage onto the bus, carrying 100 lbs on their heads with ease.\
  \ I bought a few snacks from a local vendor and quickly found my seat. Just as we\
  \ were readying to pull away a last minute passenger boarded the bus, with all of\
  \ the over head bins taken, he began shuffling bags to make room for his own. Almost\
  \ as if rehearsed, nearly every man on the bus jumped up, arms waving. They were\
  \ speaking Igbo so even though I could feel their passion, the meaning of their\
  \ words was lost on me. I leaned over to the nearest seated passenger and asked\
  \ what was happening, \u201CThey are scolding him for touching the other man\u2019\
  s bag\u201D, a woman replied. She went on to explain that it is disrespectful to\
  \ board a bus late and move other people\u2019s belongings without their consent.\
  \ I agreed completely. Her answer and the passion of the men around me made my heart\
  \ smile again. These men were defending each other without a second thought, they\
  \ were not directly affected, and could have easily turned a blind eye, but chose\
  \ to defend the situation with a personal level of conviction. The men were back\
  \ to talking and laughing just as quickly as they began shouting. There were no\
  \ hard feelings. There was just community. \n\nI had been in Nigeria for less than\
  \ 6 hours and my connection to myself and the people around me was already so deep.\
  \ The journey to get to that bus seat felt like a lifetime and in many ways it had\
  \ been. I could feel an empty space I didn\u2019t know existed began to fill. Fill\
  \ with truth. Fill with family. Fill with love."
