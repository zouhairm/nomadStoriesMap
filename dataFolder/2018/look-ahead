Text: "Having faced heartache all my life I decided to up and leave my native land\
  \ to take on a new adventure in the unknown. See, my feet was yet to touch the surface\
  \ of a foreign country and my friends have encouraged me to take this giant leap.\
  \ I then decided to apply for jobs outside of South Africa. It was after two months\
  \ that I finally got an answer from a media company in Tanzania and then agreed\
  \ to an interview via Skype.\n\nHujambo Media seemed like the perfect place for\
  \ my new start. As an esteemed copywriter my skills would work perfectly in the\
  \ vacant Media Liaison position available. My virtual appointment was with the CEO,\
  \ Adla Mdee, according to my research he was quite the esteemed business and media\
  \ mogul, being named one of Forbes Magazine\u2019s triple SSS (Sexiest, Successful\
  \ and Self-made) and all. \n\n11:30 am strikes and my Skype account alerts me about\
  \ the meeting. I answered and I my eyes met his friendly face immediately. \u201C\
  Good morning Ms. Brown, how are you?\u201D, he started, \u201COh no need to be so\
  \ formal, you can call me Tasha, or Tash, that\u2019s what my friends call me\u2026\
  \ but you\u2019re not my friend so that would be awkward, not that I\u2019m trying\
  \ to be unfriendly\u2026\u201D my nerves got the better of me and I couldn\u2019\
  t help myself from doing my occasional verbal vomit whenever I was nervous.\n\n\
  Our meeting concluded and Mr. Mdee let me know that I would know the status of my\
  \ application in two weeks. There was more to our meeting though, it was chemistry!\
  \ Two weeks had gone by and I have not received any notifications yet. I decided\
  \ to wallow in my disappointment and go about my life in South Africa. I then received\
  \ a call on 15 February 2018, that would change my life forever. \n\n\u201CGood\
  \ morning Tash, this is Adla, but you can call me AD, atleast that\u2019s what my\
  \ friends call me. I am super disappointed to have turned down your application,\
  \ but there was more to our virtual conversation than just a job. I decided to hand\
  \ your resume to another company with my reference and they want you to start immediately\u2026\
  \ Now with all the formalities out of the way, as soon as you land would you please\
  \ accompany me on a date without us having to have an awkward employee and employer\
  \ relationship?\u201D \n\nI was stunned and I barely said a word. It was then that\
  \ realized I made a local connection in Tanzania. \n\nIt was when I got on that\
  \ plane that I knew my life was going to change forever. Without realizing it my\
  \ destination was where I would find myself waking up for the rest of my life."
