Text: "I clutched my partner as we rode his motorbike, our plastic-bag ponchos crinkled\
  \ as the sky released a monsoon onto Phuket. People poured from the streets seeking\
  \ shelter; waterfalls materialized over metal roof edges. I giggled as our ride\
  \ turned into a swim. Had I lost it? No, I had found it. In this moment. \nThis\
  \ is what it was to be alive.\nThailand\u2019s festivals, mountain wats, and turquoise\
  \ beaches had lured me to this country. Moving to Thailand was filled with personal\
  \ promises. I planned to live abroad, traveling and fulfilling my bucket list. I\
  \ expected extraordinary experiences. I expected the challenges of displacement,\
  \ culture shock, and isolation that would foster personal growth. I expected both\
  \ struggle and wonder.\nPerhaps I didn\u2019t expect enough.\nI quickly noticed\
  \ joy greeted me from unsuspecting places. Shopping for food was its own adventure,\
  \ \u201CPumpkin vines? That tangled green thing? I can cook it?!\u201D Weekly walks\
  \ up Monkey Mountain came with self-assured macaques squatting in the road, taunting\
  \ me and grabbing my legs for kicks (metaphorical mostly). Sweet music and pastries\
  \ awaited me at my favorite \u201CBookhemian\u201D caf\xE9. My bold pink motorbike\
  \ was my ticket to an adrenaline filled flight on a paved runway of daring pilots.\n\
  The \u201Cmenial\u201D things had become profoundly alive. I loved these simple\
  \ day to day things, an affair I hid from the bucket list that demanded my devotion.\
  \ Island life gifted me a key to an unexpected secret garden where bliss grew unhindered.\
  \ \nTwo days before the rainy bike ride, I stood on the small island of Koh Yao\
  \ Yai. An island free of tourist raucous. On a slender beach peninsula sprinkled\
  \ with palms my eyes followed the sandbar that disappeared into the blue-green bay.\
  \ I suddenly saw how far I had really journeyed.\nThe setting sun dyed a lone storm\
  \ cloud and its rain, gold.\nMy companion and I laughed, seeking shelter under a\
  \ generous cashew tree where local women filled their buckets with the fruit that\
  \ resembled upside-down hearts. The high hanging fruit invited my friend to help.\
  \ While language limited speaking, shared smiles crossed cultural borders. I watched\
  \ the three laugh together, gathering rose-colored hearts as the sun-stained rain\
  \ sprinkled around us.  \nThe moment appeared, waiting there to be lived. It was\
  \ simply standing in the rain pulling fruit from a tree. It was paradise.\nI suspect\
  \ most happiness is not of \u201Cepic\u201D proportions, it is the everyday bliss\
  \ that shines out of the little things around us."
