Text: "Everything you've ever heard about the Pantanal is probably true: It\u2019\
  s hot, full of mosquitos and absolutely  beautiful.\nOnce in the city of Corumb\xE1\
  , in the heart of the Brazilian State of Mato Grosso do Sul, I could already feel\
  \ why it\u2019s known as \u201CThe White City\u201D. When the sun strikes the hills\
  \ of limestone, a predominant mineral in that soil, it hurts the eyes of a young\
  \ boy  who came from the south of the country, where sun-rays are shy as a scared\
  \ puppy. \nTraveling with my parents, all the decisions to come should be  taken\
  \ as a team.\nIn the first hours inside the hotel, I could feel in my skin the hunger\
  \ of the mosquitos that, extraneous to the insect repellent, were trying to carry\
  \ me into the woods by their own. \nNext morning, I was surprised by my dad, with\
  \ an unknown man named Carlos. \u201CThis is our guide\u201D, my father said. Unhappy\
  \ with the prices of the hotel's services, my father sought for another person capable\
  \ of showing us the region. Born and raised in the Pantanal, he even claimed to\
  \ be half indigenous! \nWhile driving us to the \u201CEstrada-Parque\u201D, a 120km\
  \ road that crosses part of the Pantanal, I could see that Carlos was a small talk\
  \ figure.\nOnce in the aforementioned road, we could see a board that said in tree\
  \ different languages, \u201CHigh concentration of iron ore. Only surpass with prepared\
  \ cars\u201D. Anyone would return at this point, but not my family. \nBy the second\
  \ kilometer of the trip, we had a flat tire. It was really hot by then and the car\u2019\
  s air conditioning wasn't working. When everything looked terrible, we were surprised\
  \ by a flock of blue macaws and a group of capybaras at the river in front of us.\
  \ Pantanal starts to show its magnificence. Water by both sides, and all sorts of\
  \ animals. \nEvery stop meant a considerable decrease of our patience. Suddenly,\
  \ the car just died. Nothing. In the middle of the Pantanal, with no phone signal,\
  \ no food or water and without transportation. We were in the off season, so the\
  \ traffic of people was not so intense.\nOne hour and a half later, a guy passes\
  \ by with a truck to take us to the car shop. That moment, no talking, on the top\
  \ of the truck, I was able to observe the life surrounding me. The singing of different\
  \ birds, bugs; the movement of the alligators and bulls in  the water, concluding\
  \ that every moment of that trip was worth it. \nPantanal took me to my real state\
  \ of nature."
