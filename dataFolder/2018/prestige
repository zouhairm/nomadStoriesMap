Text: "The road to pedernales is half pavement and half speed bumps. The slow speed\
  \ is perfectly fine with us as we pass through the small seaside towns and military\
  \ installations that dot the south west portion of the Dominican Republic. Our destination,\
  \ the border town of Pedernales.\n\nIt is inexplicably diverse in terrain with steep\
  \ fertile green hills guarding an arid desert and salt lake to the north; blue sand\
  \ beaches, mixed water lagoons, and limestone cliffs surrounding ink blue water\
  \ holes. Pedernales is more of a traditional sleepy seaside town with the clear\
  \ distinct exception being the stark contrasting brown hills of Haiti right next\
  \ door. My friend and guide Victor is quick to explain that is very easy to take\
  \ a cheap shot at Haiti (this being a time before presidential leaders would comment\
  \ on such things) for its apparent lack of environmental protection. Look back at\
  \ 100 years of forced debt to the French and diminishing resources for cooking fuel\
  \ to see reason for such a barren landscape. \n\nAfter a 6 hour long car ride the\
  \ air is drier but still the heat is dragging me down. The market is slow in the\
  \ mid afternoon sun. \u201CUna cerveza por favor...the..le prestige\u201D I mumble.\
  \ The stall owner shouts Haitian creole to his friend. \u201CEske ou Daku\u201D\
  \ (Is this ok) the boy replies to his superior. The boss then carefully wraps the\
  \ can with a paper towel, almost wrapping it as a present \u201CMerci\u201D I say\
  \ unsure if I should have just said Gracious. \u201CYou know messing up the trill\
  \ on your r would have been a big mistake in the past\u201D Victor is quick to mention.\
  \  At least on the north side of this island. Dominican Soldiers from the early\
  \ Trujillo regime would command Black Dominicans of Haitian descent to say the word\
  \ \u201Cperejil\u201D. Any stutter, any flaw in your trill. Your body would end\
  \ up floating down the Dajabon river to be shark food in Manzanillo Bay. Not one\
  \ to leave an awkward pause I say \u201Cluckily the river here is dry\u201D.\n\n\
  I finally feel at ease with a cold one after and I take in the bight colors of the\
  \ can, showing off \"Medailles d'or\" (gold medals). How surprising Haiti could\
  \ make an unmistakably great beer. I imagine that If this was a super bowl commercial\
  \ I could fix all the tensions by uniting friend and foe by throwing respective\
  \ cervezas and bi\xE9res in one another\u2019s hands. Guzzling through large smiles\
  \ as the sun sets on the shared ocean. Looking at the hills from far away view I\
  \ instinctively want to feel pity, instead I taste achievement."
