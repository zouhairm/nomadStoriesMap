Text: "The last thing I expected, when at 21 years old, I left on my first solo trip\u2013\
  \ 2 months in Buenos Aires, Argentina\u2013 was to fall completely in love for the\
  \ first time. \n\nI\u2019d dreamt up an incredible trip. I\u2019d read endless travel\
  \ blogs, and fantasized over and over about this adventure. I was going to live\
  \ at a residence with students from all over Latin America, and volunteer at an\
  \ NGO that made libraries around the country. I\u2019d won a scholarship from my\
  \ university to conduct interviews in the Buenos Aires Jewish community, and I was\
  \ going to take bellydance classes with one of the most incredible teachers in the\
  \ world! \n\nIt\u2019s not hard to fall in love with Buenos Aires. That happened\
  \ pretty quickly. \n\nIn my first week there, I\u2019d already rode all over the\
  \ city on the public bus and subway, made friends with a taxi driver, and taken\
  \ a strip dance class with my roommates! \n\nMy second week there was tougher. I\
  \ was adjusting to a completely new culture, and it was so intense, that one day\
  \ I fainted and had to go to the hospital. At the end of that very difficult week,\
  \ I met him.\n\nI had been invited to a dinner organized by one of his best friends.\
  \ He was there by chance, since his parents were out of town. I noticed him when\
  \ he walked in. My first thought\u2013 he seemed snooty. \n\nWhen I went to go sit\
  \ down at the dinner table, the only spot left was beside him. I thought of going\
  \ to the washroom, and switching spots when I came back, so I didn\u2019t have to\
  \ sit next to him for the whole dinner! But we introduced ourselves, and right away\
  \ he made me laugh. After a really hard week, I was finally at ease. \n\nAt that\
  \ moment I had no idea that he would play a major role in why I formed such an intimate\
  \ connection with Buenos Aires. \n\nThat was almost 6 years ago. Since then, I\u2019\
  ve gone to Buenos Aires 5 times, and spent over a year and a half there. \n\nBuenos\
  \ Aires, I\u2019ve cheered in your soccer stadiums, I\u2019ve laughed and cried\
  \ in your cafes, I\u2019ve explored your streets, I\u2019ve danced in all of your\
  \ neighbourhoods, I\u2019ve sat in your parks, I\u2019ve enjoyed your ice cream,\
  \ I\u2019ve found treasures at your fairs, I\u2019ve befriended strangers on your\
  \ buses, I\u2019ve dined in their apartments\u2026Your magic has happened to me\
  \ over and over again. \n\nFor various reasons, my relationship with my love has\
  \ recently had to make a big transition\u2013 from my future husband, to dear friend\
  \ overseas whom I love from far. \n\nLuckily, my love affair with Buenos Aires,\
  \ has only intensified."
