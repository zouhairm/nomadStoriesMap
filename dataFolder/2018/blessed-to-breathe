Text: "I woke up hearing a sound of the lawn mower. It was an early morning in Paguera,\
  \ a little town located in the west of Mallorca island. I forced myself to get out\
  \ of bed and get down the stairs to the restaurant that I was working at. I was\
  \ not satisfied about my job so every little detail was making me angry. The smell\
  \ of the restaurant kitchen was ugly, happy customers faces seemed annoying and\
  \ most of all the heat was impossible to stand wearing a classic waitress uniform.\
  \ \u201CMr. and Mrs. Clemens are here. Why don\u2019t you serve them?\u201D Renato,\
  \ my colleague, noticed how displeased I was about this morning and tried to lift\
  \ up my mood. He knew that Mr. and Mrs. Clemens always leave decent tips. \n\nMy\
  \ favorite part of the day was chit chatting with Renato at the beach when the sun\
  \ was already down. \u201CYou never told me your story, why did you come to the\
  \ island?\u201D I asked and immediately noticed the change in his face. It took\
  \ him a while to start talking. \u201CMy family is in a debt. I took a part in a\
  \ crime selling cocaine and people died because of my fault. I have to save money\
  \ to cover the debt, otherwise my mother, father and two sisters will end up the\
  \ same as everyone involved in a drug market in Colombia.\u201D \n\nAt the moment\
  \ I started to shout inside and wanted to run away from him as far as I could. But\
  \ at the same time more then anything in the world I was ready to support him. Two\
  \ months of knowing this person were enough to perceive good in him. Ultimately,\
  \ who am I to judge?  \u201CI want to help you\u201D I said. He was more confused\
  \ than before and I knew why. I showed him that I care and he was not used to it.\
  \ I wanted to save him but actually it was him who saved me.\n\nThat night we spend\
  \ hours in silence feeling the waves of the sea taking all the bad energy out and\
  \ bringing in good vibes. All I could think about was shame. Shame of myself, not\
  \ being able to value what I was given and complaining about negligible things.\
  \ I have my lungs to breathe and my legs to climb the mountains, is there anything\
  \ else I could ask for?\n\nNext day I woke up hearing a sound of the lawn mower.\
  \ It was something rapturous about that morning in the island. The heat seemed differently\
  \ bearable and I felt a fresh smell of the grass that was just cut off. Got down\
  \ to the restaurant and saw Renato cleaning glasses. \u201CLook, Mr. and Mrs. Clemens\
  \ are here. Why don\u2019t you serve them?\u201D I whispered to him and got the\
  \ most grateful smile that anyone ever gave me."
