Text: "\u201CHow much longer until we reach the market?\u201D I asked looking down\
  \ at the sweat-stained collar of my t-shirt and wondered just how long we\u2019\
  d been walking. \u201C Almost there\u201D smiled our guide, Tom.  I looked back\
  \ nervously at my travel companion and her just kind of shrugged. The sweat continued\
  \ it path down my back as we marched over the uneven ground of Old Town Mombasa.\
  \ In hindsight, it was probably not the best decisions to pick up a \u201Cguide\u201D\
  \ on the side of the road especially when they are the ones offering the tour but\
  \ my curiosity got the better of me and at least I was not alone.  What was supposed\
  \ to be a quick trip to the spice market turned into a mini shopping spree at our\
  \ arms and bags quickly filled with jewelry and wooden knick-knacks from each shop\
  \ we passed.  After the third shop, it became apparent that our soft-spoken guide\
  \ was receiving a kickback from our purchases but we didn\u2019t mind.  After spending\
  \ the past 6 days in Kenya I quickly surmised that everyone had a hustle and as\
  \ travelers, we there to fulfill our role in the symbiotic relationship. Doorways\
  \ with intricate wood and metal carvings lined the narrow street signaling the strong\
  \ Arab influence over this part of Kenya. We dodged trash and fast-moving cars as\
  \ we tried to keep up with Tom, railed off facts about the area.\n\n \n\nOur pathway\
  \ alternated between faded red and gold colors, high school children socializing\
  \ and stares from those loitering in the street and women in various styles of traditional\
  \ Muslim dress. I was excited and uneasy because I realized we were in too deep\
  \ to stop the tour.  I began to feel uneasy but kept a brave face as I alternating\
  \ between looking forward and reach behind me to make sure my friend was near. Tom\
  \ stopped and waited for us to catch up, smiling again before continuing on. At\
  \ that moment I realized we were the only women on the street. Honestly, I was not\
  \ sure how to feel. We\u2019d found ourselves in a position where we needed Tom\
  \ more than ever I want to state that I never felt truly unsafe just, extremely\
  \ aware of my otherness. Despite similarities in skin tone and bone structure we\
  \ were worlds apart. We eventually made our way to the spice market, meat market\
  \ and the Somali area of Old Town. I\u2019d secretly wished for an in depth authentic\
  \ view of Old Town and that\u2019s exactly what we received. I did not image that\
  \ I would be confronted with the strange feeling of being out of sorts."
