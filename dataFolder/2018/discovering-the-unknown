Text: "I\u2019m not sure about you, but Oman wasn\u2019t exactly at the top of my\
  \ travel bucket list. I barely knew the country existed, didn\u2019t know anything\
  \ about it\u2019s history, political climate, food or culture. All I knew was that\
  \ there would be a lot of sand and that the temperature would likely be hotter than\
  \ anything I had previously experienced. \n\nOne of the most interesting elements\
  \ of Oman is its diversity. Cultures collide in the Arabian Peninsula and this creates\
  \ an incredible opportunity to meet people from different backgrounds with various\
  \ experiences, each bringing small parts of their own culture to life. Most people\
  \ I met spoke great English, which made communicating and connecting with locals\
  \ so much easier than I had initially anticipated. But more striking than the ability\
  \ to connect was the willingness and desire of people to do so. I felt they wanted\
  \ to learn about my background and culture and how it was similar or unlike their\
  \ own. Cell phones never made an appearance on tables, maybe because the tea and\
  \ shisha took up too much space, or perhaps because there was authenticity and intention\
  \ in meeting new people. \n\nSimilarly, the physical landscape of Oman changes frequently.\
  \ The often-beige city is quickly met with the vibrant blue and turquoise waters\
  \ of the Arabian Sea. The vast orangey-brown sand of the desert with its sparsely\
  \ scattered green shrubs sits against deep canyons, lush valleys and rocky mountains.\
  \ \n\nThe relatively plain architecture of buildings is juxtaposed with the grandiose\
  \ mosques. The only distinctive landmarks throughout the city are the mosques. All\
  \ other buildings are relatively low to the ground and for the most part look the\
  \ same and start to blend in with the beige rock and sand of the landscape. The\
  \ mosques initially stand out due to their size but appear much like the rest of\
  \ the beige buildings from the outside, but once you enter the grounds, the eyes\
  \ are dazzled with patterns and colours appearing in the most intricate tiled mosaics\
  \ and tapestries. \n\nI admittedly don't know what I expected to get out of Oman.\
  \ But what I discovered was that it is completely counter-intuitive in the best\
  \ way possible and filled with contrasts around every corner making it a place for\
  \ seemingly endless discovery. The unknown potential of Oman came to represent the\
  \ unknown potential of any country and this mysterious corner of the Middle East\
  \ opened my eyes to that possibility."
