Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s like a moderate hike, you guys should be okay!\u201D grinned\
  \ my free-spirited tour leader Don, as I looked up in dread at the speck in the\
  \ distance that would mark the finish line of the walk.  \n\nWe had driven up to\
  \ the Chittenden parking area, the starting point of our trail up Mount Washburn,\
  \ one of the most famous peaks in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming. \n\nAt this\
  \ point in time, I was already halfway through a roadtrip across the northern belt\
  \ of the USA, having visited nine states across ten days with a group of strangers.\
  \ The night before the hike, I had attempted to sleep in sub-zero temperatures on\
  \ a rocky terrain, shuddering my way through what had to be one of the most uncomfortable\
  \ nights of my life. \n\nRegardless I pushed on with the journey, telling myself\
  \ that it couldn\u2019t be that hard. Famous last words. Halfway through the walk,\
  \ I started to feel worse-for-wear. I would discover later in the trip that this\
  \ was down to dehydration, as I was not accounting for the extra water intake in\
  \ the high altitude of the mountainous state. \n\nAfter shuffling my way up the\
  \ first leg of the hike, I briefly waved to my companions that I needed to stop\
  \ for a moment. Looking out across the panoramic views that lasted for miles, I\
  \ took a deep breath to psych myself up and push past my physical barriers. \n\n\
  Motivated, I stood up raring to go and promptly threw up all over the flowers next\
  \ to me. \n\nAt this point, finishing seemed impossible. Concerned, a fellow trekker\
  \ reassured me that she\u2019d be willing to abandon the hike and go back to the\
  \ parking lot with me to wait for the others. I had a sudden epiphany. This woman\
  \ was prepared to sacrifice her adventure to care for someone she\u2019d only known\
  \ for over a week. Her generosity spurred me to continue on. I would not spoil this\
  \ chance for either of us. \n\nOn the way up, we made acquaintances with a group\
  \ of mountain goats, animals I had never encountered before. Our meeting reaffirmed\
  \ why I was putting myself through the paces. I travelled here to discover a new\
  \ world, and no amount of puking would change that. \n\nOnce we finally arrived\
  \ at the summit, the group gathered together for photo opportunities. On the edge\
  \ of the lookout point stood the sign, \u2018MT. WASHBURN, 10,243 ft\u2019. I posed\
  \ next to it proudly, before requesting my photographer to take one more snap.\n\
  \nMy grin firmly in place, I turned to the sign and flipped up my middle finger.\
  \ After all, I had a rather love-hate relationship with this natural wonder."
