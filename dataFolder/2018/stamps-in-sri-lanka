Text: "Someone else is in our room, she says. It was double-booked. They got here\
  \ first. Our would-be homestay host\u2019s concerned expression transfers to our\
  \ own faces as we begin to grasp the meaning of her words. My husband and I have\
  \ just arrived to the town of Mirissa, Sri Lanka. We are hot, sticky, and dehydrated;\
  \ sporting dusty backpacks and empty water bottles with no place to stay. Our belongings\
  \ are carried on our backs. We sold the rest, choosing this life for the next year\
  \ or so (despite our tendency to come up short when others ask what, exactly, we\
  \ are searching for). \nAs we sit on the porch trying to figure out a plan, our\
  \ would-be host reemerges from her house. She has just spoken to her Grandparents\
  \ on the phone, and they\u2019d be happy to take us in for a few nights. One of\
  \ the biggest lessons our travels have taught us so far is how these things tend\
  \ to work themselves out more often then when you go with the flow. Soon we find\
  \ ourselves being swept away into a bright blue tuk-tuk and driven through winding\
  \ dirt roads as the late afternoon sun lights up our bodies in polygonal patches\
  \ through the vehicle\u2019s open sides. A short seven minutes later our driver\
  \ slows squeakily to a stop in front of a white stucco house with a clay-red roof.\
  \ Two coconut-bearing palm trees tower regally in the yard. I am floored -- this\
  \ home is unexpectedly gorgeous. We are greeted by a smiling petite woman with pearl\
  \ white teeth who motions for us to come inside. This must be Grandma. I am relieved\
  \ to slip off my sweaty sandals and leave them outside the door. The cool indoor\
  \ red clay earth is a welcome retreat for the soles of my feet. Once inside, a man\
  \ -- Grandpa? -- shakes our hands and introduces himself as Ricki. His wife, Sayuri,\
  \ doesn\u2019t speak much English. Ricki speaks a little. \u201CI want to show you\
  \ something\u201D he says. We walk out onto the patio and I notice a large dusty-brown\
  \ book at the table next to the stack of thick envelopes. Ricki collects stamps.\
  \ He has books and books filled with hundreds, maybe thousands of stamps from all\
  \ over the world. \u201CThis hobby of stamps teaches you much about cultures. Much\
  \ about people everywhere\u201D Ricki explains. \u201CYou see in the pictures. You\
  \ learn about how culture is by the pictures. See in there we will start from the\
  \ beginning.\u201D Tears well up in my eyes as I inhale and look up at the stars\
  \ in the night sky. At this very moment I am absolutely certain we are in the midst\
  \ of finding what we are searching for."
