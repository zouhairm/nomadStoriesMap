Text: "There is a writer inside me, wishing to paint a new world only with my words.\n\
  There is a photographer too, who enjoy catching the reality in small pieces.\nAnd\
  \ there is a biologist with all the curiosity of a child and the science under my\
  \ arm to discover how the world works.\nI took the three of them to a journey and\
  \ none went back in the same way.\nThe island was as new and at the same time as\
  \ older, as just a volcano island could be. Its last eruption happened 12 years\
  \ ago. The lava repainted a new landscape in one day; the survivors needed several\
  \ springs to put new colors at the ground. \nWhen we arrived the slopes of the volcano\
  \ were covered with vineyards, small grapes hung down from their branches and the\
  \ islanders were tasting its last harvest of the sweeter, stronger and spicy wine\
  \ that I have ever tried. \nThe party started with a glass of the Cha wine, which\
  \ filled us with the local heat. After came the drums and finally the chorus. The\
  \ songs talked about \u201Cthe fire\u201D that rule the island life. All the people\
  \ in the tavern had experienced at least one of the volcano eruptions, some more\
  \ than one. The runs through the mountains, the fear in their veins, the sadness\
  \ over their losses\u2026 but, above all, the joy of life, after survive.\nIt\xB4\
  s impossible to separate Fogo\xB4s people from Pico, their volcano, it has been\
  \ giving live and death to their vineyards for more than a hundred years.  \nSo,\
  \ when two young men invited us to climb up to the crater the next morning, we had\
  \ to say yes.  No one should miss the opportunity to meet the origin of their wine,\
  \ their hopes and their nightmares.\nAt 6 a.m. our new friends guided us until the\
  \ summit of the volcano. They were five hours of struggle, every step the light\
  \ stones rolled back downhill and we felt like if we didn\u2019t move. But finally\
  \ we get there and we look at the sleepy heart of Pico: dark, impressive and deceptively\
  \ peaceful. \nThe photographer inside me almost cries, unable to capture the unmistakable\
  \ beauty of such a roughness place. \nThe way down was even more surprising, I have\
  \ never expected to ski a volcano, and that was the final present that Joao and\
  \ Nelson keep for us: an unforgettable experience.\nWe come back to \u201Cour\u201D\
  \ island, where my biologist side continued working, helping to establish the first\
  \ protected areas in the archipelago. \nThe writer in me wrote reports about endangered\
  \ species, but he kept unwritten the story of the night when I fall in love with\
  \ Cabo Verde and their people. Until now."
