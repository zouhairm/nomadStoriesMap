Text: "I\u2019ve never felt such a brisk and frosty wind coming against me. It was\
  \ when I first started to walk out from the car, which took me and my family from\
  \ Kathmandu to Kuri village. But graced with all the beautiful landscapes and glorious\
  \ sunset, I couldn\u2019t stop myself from taking a snap of it. The place is free\
  \ from unnecessary crowd, litter and anything mankind produces at easily accessible\
  \ places.  A 6 hour drive from Kathmandu, Kuri is a serene place which is the base\
  \ camp to the holy place Kalinchowk. Getting to Kuri is not an easy feat as the\
  \ trails are really daunting and filled with snow. After a difficult ride or hike\
  \ comes Kuri, which is a small settlement colonized mostly by Sherpas.\nExhausted\
  \ by the traveling and shivering in the icy cold weather, fire became our savior\
  \ as we got cozy in the fireplace. The tongba (millet-based alcoholic beverage)\
  \ also became a subsidiary. The hot dinner we had later brought a warm surge in\
  \ our body and no one resisted to a goodnight sleep. \nOverlooking the fact that\
  \ one cannot abandon the early morning sleep amplified by the cold weather, we missed\
  \ the opportunity to watch a perfect sunrise from the top of Kalinchowk. Nevertheless,\
  \ we started our hike taking high hopes in our minds that no further complications\
  \ would arise. The locals said that it\u2019d take about one and a half hour to\
  \ reach atop. During our total ascend, the hills covered with snow and the different\
  \ mountains gave its preview on the different aspect of the horizon. After climbing\
  \ for almost two hours, we reached the peak of Kalinchowk temple. Once you reach\
  \ the top, you can see the place surrounded by metal tridents and some mountain\
  \ peaks seem to be standing just next to you. The brilliance of the landscape from\
  \ the top justified our persistence. While the climb was an arduous task for us,\
  \ descending down the peak was comparatively easier. The splendour of the Langtang\
  \ range, Mt. Gaurishankar and other peaks made our descent even more effortless.\
  \ \nThe timing of our visit to Kalinchowk couldn\u2019t have been anymore perfect\
  \ as the place was fully covered with snow, the sky was crystal clear, the landscape\
  \ of the dwindling sequence of hills, lustrous range of mountains were spellbinding.\
  \ All of us were reluctant to depart such a remarkable ambiance but all our leftover\
  \ works wouldn\u2019t let us stop. So, we left the small settlement of Kuri with\
  \ a heavy heart taking away the breathtaking views and all the unforgettable memories\
  \ we had in the place."
