Text: "I landed in Reykjavik for the first time in my life. I bought the ticket on\
  \ a whim and just decided to go. I've always wanted to go. At the airport I was\
  \ able to get a car and be on my way to the airbnb I booked. 5 days of travelling\
  \ through Iceland. Let\u2019s go!. \n\nNot being connected to any internet made\
  \ it quite a difficult task. The signs were not in English and I didn\u2019t have\
  \ an idea what direction I was supposed to go in, so I just turned left and continued\
  \ until I ended up in a residential part of the city. I stopped next to the road\
  \ to ask a young woman for some help. She had a parrot on her shoulder. Her mother\
  \ came out of their front door and asked what the person we were staying with\u2019\
  s name was with her phone in her hand. Just by the person's last name she could\
  \ search it on an online database and show it to me on a map. I eventually got there,\
  \ checked in and took the first day easy. \n\nI later found out that the database\
  \ is of everyone in Iceland. It\u2019s a small population, no more that 350000 people\
  \ in the whole country. It\u2019s so family trees can be researched, and makes connecting\
  \ the dots between each Icelandic inhabitant possible. \n\nThe next morning I took\
  \ the car into the city. Ragner Axelson\u2019s photo gallery was right at the top\
  \ of things I had to do. I saw men with beards wearing jeans and red chequered shirts.\
  \ And as I had a coffee at the Kex hostel I found everyone I spoke to to be friendly,\
  \ and happy. The Harpa is the modern theatre and concert hall that was spectacular\
  \ to see and walk through. The materials used all reference the dramatic natural\
  \ landscape of Iceland. Black granite walls represents the volcanos and the jagged\
  \ glass windows the ice glaciers. \n\nI then decided to drive out of the city. I\
  \ wanted to see waterfalls, a black sand beach, long haired horses I've only seen\
  \ in pictures, and a landscape that almost never seems to end. And during this drive,\
  \ I found the best part to be that the sun only set for a couple of hours. So there\
  \ I was driving in daylight at 11 o clock at night. How crazy is that! \n\nThe Blue\
  \ Lagoon can be visited in the south, and you can find over 13 large waterfalls.\
  \ It\u2019s scenic bliss and a photographer\u2019s heaven. NASA apparently sent\
  \ Neil Armstrong to Iceland to train before his flight to the moon.  Just like that\
  \ taste of that one amazing Peking Duck I once had in China can be recalled instantly,\
  \ so too can the visual experience of driving in Iceland. And just like that, I\u2019\
  m there."
