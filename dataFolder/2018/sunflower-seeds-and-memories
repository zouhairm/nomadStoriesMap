Text: "I drove an inch and then another, and then a mile and I saw the miles he saw,\
  \ and I miss him all the miles.\n\nI was brave. I ran away from a house in Texas,\
  \ tiny and 15, buying a ticket at the counter and throwing up in the plane\u2019\
  s bathroom because I was scared for me and scared for the brothers I was leaving\
  \ behind.\n\nI call him and say I'll be landing, surprise, in two hours. He was\
  \ 3 hours away and was there, waiting, when I got off the plane. \n\nI was brave.\
  \ I traveled several states away for a concert, skipping school, feeling like a\
  \ rebel and then got lost and in a panic call and rat myself out. \n\nI was brave.\
  \ I traveled 27 straight hours in a car with my friend, westbound to LA. We hit\
  \ Big Sur and hit up a bar for 4 dollar PBR and I almost touched a seal but dared\
  \ not because I love them. He called me when he found out, heartbroken and a little\
  \ proud I never told him I was traveling so far away.\n\nI was brave. I first traveled\
  \ outside the US to Honduras for 2 months, and I did it alone. But I called him,\
  \ everyday. \n\nI check my tires. Dad always made sure I did. He was, at heart,\
  \ a tire guy, even when he drove big rigs across his home state.\n\nSo I check them.\
  \ Then I drove an inch, and another, driving and driving, anywhere in Kansas, because\
  \ I had to see what he saw.\n\nMy uncharted territory, and his affinity. But I'm\
  \ brave. \n\nI drive through the Flint Hills, trying not to think about what he\
  \ thought while singing Green Acres across this state, spitting sunflower shells\
  \ into a cup even though his dentist said to stop. I pass a semi, waving too furiously.\
  \ I stop and take pictures atop rocks carved out for this road and that. \n\nAnd\
  \ in boring ol\u2019 Kansas, I stood and looked and looked and it was beautiful,\
  \ with fading sunshine that lit hills on fire, plains that waved forever, and finally\
  \ I could wonder if he'd done the same, with his dog who was Lucky.\n\nI drive some\
  \ more because it's the only thing I have left. His miles. His Kansas skies, and\
  \ his Kansas sights. His every single mile marker. \n\nMy gas light comes on, and\
  \ I reach for my phone. And even though I knew I'd do it, it's still the last thing\
  \ I expected, that I'd be this lost. \n\nIt rings and rings and rings and rings.\
  \ \n\nI drive an inch. And then a mile. I miss him all the miles, but I know I'll\
  \ find fuel as I go."
