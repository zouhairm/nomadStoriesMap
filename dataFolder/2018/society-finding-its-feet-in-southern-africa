Text: "There were unsupervised toddlers sucking on sugar straws and running barefoot\
  \ through the unpaved neighborhood, amongst seemingly wild chickens and steers.\
  \ The tin-roofed houses were all rusting, and the concrete floor of the medicine\
  \ woman\u2019s home was far from comfortable. And in the community center, the leaking\
  \ roof and its considerable damage attracted the attention of other Westerners as\
  \ they discussed setting up a Go-Fund-Me for the repairs, but my eyes kept drifting\
  \ to a 1987 Encyclopedia Britannica, as I wondered what outdated information could\
  \ possibly be of use to our Zulu hosts.\n\nThe tribal village situated in the appropriately\
  \ named Valley of a Thousand Hills, just outside South Africa\u2019s coastal city,\
  \ Durban, appeared as much a work in progress as its residents, striving to bridge\
  \ long-held traditions while embracing as much of the modern world as they could\
  \ access.\n\nDays later, I traveled from Durban to Lesotho, a small country high\
  \ in the Drakensburg Mountains. By happenstance, my guide, Ndu, was from the same\
  \ Zulu village I had just visited. He passed candies into tiny, begging hands, while\
  \ asking these children why they weren\u2019t in school. Blanket-wrapped shepherds\
  \ posed for a photo, only asking a few coins in exchange. The coastal sun was gone;\
  \ the dense fog and persistent drizzle reflected the change in mood.\n\nA local\
  \ woman led me into a standalone, circular room, the floor a continuation of the\
  \ earth.\n\n\u201CIs this the kitchen room?\u201D I asked, referencing architectural\
  \ observations I made in the Valley of a Thousand Hills. \u201CThis is my house,\u201D\
  \ she replied. \u201CBut the building next door\u2026?\u201D \u201C\u2026is my neighbor\u2019\
  s house,\u201D then explained how families assisted each other in gathering rocks\
  \ and mortaring them together. And, Ndu whispered, without the government assistance\
  \ provided in South Africa.\n\nThis woman gave me local bread to sample, while Ndu\
  \ gave her groceries and the hand-me-down clothing his neighbors had donated.\n\n\
  I was humbled. It was obvious: despite the old books and leaky roofs, the Zulu were\
  \ not pitiful. They are thriving. They have homes and food and clothing and plenty\
  \ to gift their brothers across the border. They have lived through the breakdown\
  \ of racial barriers, the development of professional opportunities for their people,\
  \ and the breakthrough of civil rights in post-Apartheid South Africa. There is\
  \ a confidence that tomorrow will be better than today. And, this gives me hope\
  \ for all disenfranchised people, everywhere, even at home."
