Text: "My life goal was always to capture moments. I do this as a filmmaker, leaving\
  \ imprints of the people and places I see through my lens. I do this as an actor\
  \ who unearths moments of raw emotion in true or imagined circumstance. And lastly,\
  \ as I writer, I encapsulate moments with words. \n\nThis particular journey begins\
  \ at the end, a fifteen-minute drive from my home in Toronto, nestled in between\
  \ glass ornaments, macaroni art and mugs with \u201Cbest grandma\u201D scribbled\
  \ across them. \n\nMy grandmother, at age sixteen, embarked on an adventure, following\
  \ the love of her life to the Middle East. She marched every day; in high heels\
  \ through the farm fields he was working, demanding he look her way. My grandmother,\
  \ now ill, with worn wrinkles from years of smiling, cannot remember her own story.\
  \ Still, every time my grandfather outstretches his hand to hers I see a flicker\
  \ of that sixteen year old who knew what she wanted and went for it. \n\nThis inspired\
  \ my trip to where it all began. I arrived in this foreign country, expecting to\
  \ feel a connection, my own DNA made up of the stories of my ancestors here, my\
  \ grandmothers heel prints buried underneath the trod on soil. \n\nI saw her home,\
  \ heard the songs she once danced to. Yet, I couldn\u2019t capture her story. That\
  \ night I lay under the stars, in the middle of the Jordanian desert, feeling helpless.\
  \ The wind drifting overtop of me, light barely visible from a distant campsite.\
  \ I\u2019d spent all this time clinging to a captured moment, and the last thing\
  \ I expected happened to me:\nI felt nothing. \n\nI couldn\u2019t find my grandmother\
  \ here. I looked up, discerning that captured moments couldn\u2019t simply be reproduced.\
  \  While viewing, imagining and reading opened my eyes to what is out in the vast\
  \ expanse, it isn\u2019t the place, but the connections, the human element; the\
  \ hand outstretched to my grandmother that is everlasting. The specific moments,\
  \ like those distant stars above me, were gone. Faded, disintegrated into the night\
  \ sky like the millions before it. \n\nI stood up, a single 5\"1 girl, with arms\
  \ outstretched, pledging to take hold of my own adventures. I was ready to try foreign\
  \ spices in the aromatic marketplace, to feed camels with the locals, to take action.\
  \ And suddenly, there were footsteps behind me. A new friend who I'd learn had a\
  \ similar resolve, who\u2019d join me for the rest of my adventure. I placed out\
  \ my palm, realizing that when we stop trying to capture someone else\u2019s, we\
  \ can truly chase our own stars, together."
