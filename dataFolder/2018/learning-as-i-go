Text: "9/16/2016\nAs I sit sipping coffee in the courtyard at the hostel that Joey\
  \ and I arrived at last night I can\u2019t help but feel an overwhelming sense of\
  \ clarity. Seattle had its perks, but I already feel more at home in Portland. The\
  \ conversation of all the travelers surrounding me is intoxicating. I\u2019m beginning\
  \ to let go of things I know I can\u2019t control. I will fall in love one day,\
  \ but first I'm going to fall in love with myself.\n***\nI begin talking with a\
  \ silver-haired woman and I am immediately drawn to her. She speaks in a way that\
  \ makes me actually want to listen to what she\u2019s saying. We chatted while the\
  \ other travelers laughed and smoked at the tables beside us under the morning sun.\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to forget her. I remember my journal and slide it across the\
  \ table, asking if she\u2019ll write something for me. She doesn\u2019t hesitate.\n\
  \n\u201CWhen deciding where to go & when, stay in your heart & listen to your intuition.\
  \ If you get an opportunity to take \u2018The Phenomena & the Gift\u2019 out of\
  \ Oneness University in India take it, it will be one of the most special gifts\
  \ you can give yourself.\u201D \n\nJoey soon joined me and we had a cigarette with\
  \ two young men. One was a fairly outgoing guy from the UK, full of dry humor and\
  \ flirtatious gestures. The other was a more reserved American boy with a kind smile\
  \ and a soft demeanor; I could tell he was a writer.\n\nWe spent the remainder of\
  \ the daylight with these two new friends. We wandered into one of the city\u2019\
  s many dispensaries. I left with a cookie in one hand and a sticker in the other.\
  \ It read \u201CGet Stoned\u201D with a drawing of a rock underneath the lettering.\
  \ Hilarious.\n\nWandering through the Portland Art Museum I begin to feel the effects\
  \ of the magical cookie. I walk past a group of smartly dressed people staring at\
  \ a small sculpture on the second floor. I bite my tongue as I listen to them trying\
  \ to find meaning in every etch.\n\nWe leave the museum and float down the lively\
  \ streets, the day had almost completely slipped away. Before long, we arrive at\
  \ the flashing neon sign that reads \u201CVoodoo Doughnut\u201D. A line of people\
  \ snake out the front door and continue onto a small portion of the sidewalk. After\
  \ waiting our turns, countless varieties stared me in the face. As I try to form\
  \ a decision, my mind wanders back to the man I left behind. I remember the night\
  \ we met, drunkenly laughing over a bowl of cereal in his bedroom after we had left\
  \ our friends at the bar. I see a doughnut covered in froot loops on the left side\
  \ of the display. I buy it."
