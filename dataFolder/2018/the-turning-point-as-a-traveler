Text: "I have always dreamt of traveling the world \u2013 I would lay awake at night\
  \ dreaming of all the possibilities to see breathtaking landscapes, taste the ethnic\
  \ food, converse with the locals, and learn the rich history of each place I would\
  \ visit. At the time I had been finishing my university degree when I began questioning\
  \ the meaning of travel \u2013 I wanted to know what the stories behind the experiences\
  \ were. \n\nIt was on a cold winter night that I spontaneously booked a one-way\
  \ flight across the world to a tropical paradise to begin a story that would change\
  \ my life forever. A month later, I packed my bags and landed in Southeast Asia\
  \ with nothing more than my first-night stay booked. Fear should have been my initial\
  \ instinct but instead, I was overwhelmed with the invigorating sense of freedom.\
  \ Freedom to run, play, and laugh \u2013 and to see and do as much as I possibly\
  \ could. I was excited to experience and learn the stories of the people around\
  \ me and to take part in the unique culture. \n\nMy passion for writing and photography\
  \ became all too clear throughout this journey as I was always eager to wake up\
  \ at the crack of dawn each day to run around and capture the natural lives of the\
  \ people, the wild waves of the ocean, the majestic tropical jungles, and the sweet\
  \ goodbyes as the sun kissed the earth goodnight at the end of each day \u2013 all\
  \ to tell a story. A story for my own personal pleasure to look back on and for\
  \ the people that have read my stories or swiped through my photos in hopes of inspiring\
  \ a bit of joy, motivation, and wanderlust. \n\nI had trekked across Asia for six\
  \ months and had kept a travel journal with me every step of the way. When I got\
  \ home, I knew I needed to share the stories and experiences I had the opportunity\
  \ to be a part of \u2013 so, I started my own travel blog. \n\nMonths later, I felt\
  \ this deep nagging from within \u2013 that I needed to get out and explore and\
  \ to do and see much more. That initial one-way ticket had pushed me to the edge\
  \ of any life I had before it all began. I knew in this moment that I would never\
  \ be able to go back to the life I was living before. Travel has planted its roots\
  \ deep within my soul and I am forever wandering to find the experiences and stories\
  \ to set my soul on fire."
