Text: "Fast forward, and we were on the road en-route a little known place in the\
  \ Deccans of central India. Had read a small piece of article about Fireflies festival\
  \ at Purushwadi, that got me curious. Made some arrangements to crash in bed after\
  \ all day's ride. Early morning next day got acquainted with a local guy. Chatting\
  \ over a chai made us friends. Initially hesitant, he took care of our food and\
  \ stay and showed us around for following next couple of days. humble guy. \n\n\
  We were attended by his Mr. Junior, showing us around while he was away in his fields.\
  \ Bestowed with enthusiasm, junior made us walk to the top of a small hill in the\
  \ midst of jungle and down we found a small lake of clear water surrounded by trees\
  \ on three sides. As we sat there in canopy with the legs dipped in water and the\
  \ boy showed us some of his somersault diving skills. There was a pleasant calmness\
  \ and chill in the place as the wind gushed through, breaking the stills of water.\
  \ Sun came down leaving the horizon amber, the canvas of scattered clouds looked\
  \ mesmerizing. It was turning dark and we started briskly walking back home. It\
  \ was completely dark by now. We were super excited. It was almost the time.\n\n\
  We were welcomed to a snacks of Hot sweet-potatoes baked in a pit dug in the ground\
  \ and garnished with some spiced rock salt. After an early dinner. we were finally\
  \ ready to see the magic happen.\n\nHeaded a little deeper in the woods and wallah,\
  \ there were we. \nThe dance of fireflies. Unbelievably amazing, felt nothing short\
  \ of pure magic, what a night that was.\nThe whole of the forest was lit by tiny\
  \ magical creatures. It appeared I have entered the magical worlds of Pandora. Unreal.\n\
  \nIts fascinating, the wonders that swarm of theses tiny creatures can create. magical\
  \ mystical creations of nature. The sight filled my eyes.\n\nNext day, woke up early\
  \ and after a heavy breakfast with bhajji and chai flavored with exotic herbs and\
  \ homemade spices, we made our way to mountain top and soon we were in heavens,\
  \ walking through the clouds. there we laid on grass in silence for long and my\
  \ phone planted in time lapse capturing the moving clouds as the mist cleared. I\
  \ wanted to stay there forever.\n\nIt was end of the trip. Waving adieus to our\
  \ newly found friends. We hit the road with our hearts filled with happiness, until\
  \ the next trip which will hopefully hold more excitement in store."
