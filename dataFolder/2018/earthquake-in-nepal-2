Text: "It`s been already my fifth day in Kathmandu, so after seeing most of the things\
  \ around, I wanted to spend this day practicing my street photography skills. As\
  \ of hot weather I packed just my wallet, water and camera in to my bag. However,\
  \ I wasn't even expecting that I am going to sleep next two nights outside on the\
  \ ground with nothing. Five minutes before 12.00, I saw on the sky something I have\
  \ never seen before. The whole upper atmosphere was covered with birds of all kinds,\
  \ almost like a dark cloud, flying in to the one direction. It was one of the most\
  \ bizarre things I have ever seen. Shortly after, few elderly woman started to run\
  \ around, shouting. I was the only tourist there. I noticed sudden panic around.\
  \ Seconds after the earthquake began, the ground started to shake extremely violently.\
  \ I could only hear the movement of the plates, even thought buildings were collapsing\
  \ around me. At this point I realized its a disaster. As soon as earthquake finished,\
  \ I knew I had to get out of this small-scaled street Woman were crying, few people\
  \ were injured, everyone was just in shock. I just managed to run around the corner\
  \ to the temple area. After 30 minutes few birds flew suddenly away again in same\
  \ direction as before. At this point, we all knew what is going to happened after\
  \ 20 seconds. Few people were screaming, but, luckily, buildings around managed\
  \ to stay as they were. After, the situation was stable enough to start to think\
  \ what my next move is going to be. I was on the street again, witnessing a disaster,\
  \ collapsed buildings, wounded people, completely destroyed roads. After another\
  \ shake, I decided not to go to hotel, so slept on the ground with nothing. The\
  \ second night was even worst. This time was raining heavily all night! I was only\
  \ able to hide\_all my electronics under my belly, and that is\_how I spent next\
  \ 8 hours, wet and awake. In the morning I  I took my backpack, and I left. At this\
  \ point, I didn't even know where I was going to go. Luckily, I noticed few buses\
  \ on the street, so I took one to Pokhara, a city 8 h ride away from Kathmandu.\
  \ Driving trough city, I was able to see the real scale of what happened in past\
  \ two days! Third of the capital got destroyed. I returned to Kathmandu after seven\
  \ days. Buildings were still as I saw them leaving with bricks all around. I still\
  \ wasn't able to see much of international aid. The whole experience also changed\
  \ my view how people act in such a crisis,\_when it's not really their backyard."
