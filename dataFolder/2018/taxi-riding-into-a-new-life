Text: "\u201EHow long until Osh city\u201C, I asked Bakyt a little desperate. I couldn't\
  \ wait to get there! \u201EThree hours\u201C, the 24 year old taxi driver replied,\
  \ spitting Pipas shells out of the corner of his mouth. He had been munching on\
  \ them during most of the journey. I had tried some a few hours ago which ended\
  \ up in a mess and lots of the shells getting stuck in my teeth. The right technique,\
  \ angle and lip tension was essential to cleanly cracking those and surgically removing\
  \ shell from seed with the tongue. Eating Pipas was not the only skill I would start\
  \ mastering in the following months.\nPatience would be another.\n\u201CCome, drink\
  \ coffee\u201D, Bakyt said 10 hours earlier that day, pulling me inside one of the\
  \ containers/bazaar huts. Despite my meagre knowledge of Kyrgyz finding a Taxi ride\
  \ to Osh had proven suprisingly easy. I even managed to haggle a price of 1300 Som,\
  \ just slightly above what locals pay. But at this point the endless waiting started.\
  \ Waiting for more passengers, to fill the car, waiting for herders and their animals\
  \ to clear the roads, on their way down from the summer pastures, and finally sitting\
  \ out the very long journey. Planning ahead apparently was useless in this country\
  \ where the flow of time seems to follow different rules.\nThe 800 km ride from\
  \ Bishkek to Osh, over the snowy mountain chains separating the north and south\
  \ of Kyrgyzstan, had started out great. Once we cleared the rather run-down and\
  \ shabby outskirts of Bishkek the first view of the Tian Shan instantaneously took\
  \ my breath. Over 80% of Kyrgyzstans land mass is mountainous. So, no matter where,\
  \ you usually have a 360\xB0 view of mountains looming in the distance. And what\
  \ a sight they offer! Mountain ranges and valleys shine in red, green, brown, grey\
  \ and white due to the minerals in the stones and soils, vegetation, ice and snow.\n\
  But after 9 hours of the journey and some vodka, tea and cooked sheep lungs offered\
  \ by my fellow travellers, 3 funny, noisy grannies and Nurtilek, a mid twenties\
  \ outgoing man, my stomach was giving up on me. Also the constant blast of Kyrgyz\
  \ folk and Russian pop was getting to my head. I was starting to feel nauseous in\
  \ the stuffy car. Kyrgyz sociality is hard to decline, but saying no in the proper\
  \ way would prove to be one of my most valuable lessons. 5 months of anthropological\
  \ research and a job as German and English language teacher, at the Oshmu university,\
  \ awaited me. Armed with these valuable lessons it would turn out to be quite a\
  \ productive time."
