Text: "Fear instinctively gripped me as I realised that I had come this far based\
  \ on a whim, and was now standing at the edge of a cliff in Manali. I ran all of\
  \ four steps before I froze, but my legs buckled with the force of my harness as\
  \ my guide continued to run forward. I fell backwards into my harness which had\
  \ fortunately converted in to a makeshift seat and before I knew it we had taken\
  \ flight.\n\nOne rarely understands the grandeur of the majestic himalayas until\
  \ you experience it first-hand in a state like this. Floating through the clouds,\
  \ the world several metres beneath your feet, the blue sky on top of you, gliding\
  \ through the air with semi-controllable wings gives new meaning to a bird\u2019\
  s eye view. The experience of paragliding through the Himalayas is truly one-of-a-kind.\n\
  \nI was brought out of my stupor by my guide who asked me if I had my camera with\
  \ me and would like to take a picture. I realised I didn\u2019t have my camera but\
  \ my new iphone - a gift from my brother - was in my back pocket. I thought back\
  \ about my loved ones, a chosen few I would switch places with in a heartbeat, for\
  \ I know how much they would value and appreciate this moment so much more than\
  \ me. I wanted to take a picture for them, not to show off, not even as proof of\
  \ having pursued this adventurous sport, but just so that my loved ones could virtually\
  \ experience that surreal moment and somehow partake in the joy \u2013 which I probably\
  \ was not worthy enough of to relish on my own.\n\nYet, it was not a practical option,\
  \ my guide recommended against it for fear that the phone may slip from my fingers\
  \ and we wouldn\u2019t be able to recover it. I thought about it for a minute \u2013\
  \ two things could happen, either I could get a great picture but my view would\
  \ be limited to the perimeter of the camera lens, and once again continue to be\
  \ the person I had grown up to be \u2013 always thinking about others before myself,\
  \ or I could lose the cherished phone while trying to take the picture, feel sadness,\
  \ in turn hold my loved ones responsible for my loss and once again tread the downtrodden\
  \ path I had always followed, or this time I could try something new. My friend\u2019\
  s words rang in my ears \u2013 go out and live your life \u2013 you owe this to\
  \ yourself, and with that I felt a calming sense of relief. My guide asked me again\
  \ \u2013 \u201Caren\u2019t you going to take a picture?\u201D, he asked. I smiled\
  \ and said, \u201CNo, this one is for my eyes only\u201D and with that for the first\
  \ time in years, I was finally free \u2013 from guilt, remorse and me."
