Text: "\u201CLily!\u201D\n\nThe exclamation mark is more how I felt than how he said\
  \ my name.\n\nI lived in a community along Nepal\u2019s Indian border for four months\
  \ on a Fulbright Scholarship. There, I met Nabin. A bike ride took me through fields\
  \ of yellow-lime mustard, air saturated with the smell of ripe bananas, calls of\
  \ my name and invitations to tea. The daily dusty blue of the sky, the morning coo\
  \ of dark, moist air, the evening blaze of a sunken rose, were all quickly stroked\
  \ away by the unrelenting movement of the earth. The depth of my experience in Nepal\
  \ came through conversations and relationships that showed my community that I wanted\
  \ to learn. Over time, I evolved from being the random foreigner in town to being\
  \ \u201CLily\u201D.\n\nNabin said my name like that. \n\nAt 11, Nabin moved from\
  \ his mother\u2019s home to live with my host family in Kholesimal. My host family\
  \ owned a \u201Crestaurant\u201D (it\u2019s main sustenance being alcohol), a town\
  \ about 20 minutes by bike from his mother\u2019s village. Nabin worked my host\
  \ family\u2019s restaurant for his school fees and room and board. He frequently\
  \ brought his tip money of 20 rupees (20 cents) to his home, where his mother worked\
  \ a cornfield to support his younger sister and brother. I asked to visit his family,\
  \ and after we brought them ghee and a chicken, he held my hand the entire bike\
  \ ride home. \n\nNabin and I communicated with the language of our movements more\
  \ than with words. Although I was learning Nepali (the national language), his quick\
  \ tone did not lend to a nonnative speaker\u2019s ability to understand him, and\
  \ he felt the same about my English. We spoke through smiles and quizzical faces,\
  \ the motions of our hands and the ways our bodies danced. After a five A.M. run,\
  \ we shared tea and silence, went about our days, and played badminton in the evening,\
  \ or soccer, or music. I often found him washing dishes late into the night, singing\
  \ in his lovely cracked voice. \n\nBack at home in Montana, my mind often wanders\
  \ to Nabin. How he crossed the street and bought us pink cotton candy, when we sat\
  \ in the back of the bus and he told me he wants to travel to America, our swims\
  \ in the muddy river. I will never completely understand all that Nabin said to\
  \ me. The only shriveled words we understood from each other, \n\nwere each other\u2019\
  s names."
