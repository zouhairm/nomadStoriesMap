Text: "Sat in a rubber ring, floating down the Nam Song River in Northern Laos, the\
  \ sun starting to set ahead of me, it was beautiful and I was more than content.\
  \  I noticed some local teens playing and doing back flips into the water, they\
  \ smiled and waved I shouted \u2018Sabaidi\u2019 back, then one of the boys swam\
  \ over.   He introduced himself as Lei and asked if he could hitch a ride down river,\
  \ then with arms tucked into the back of our rings, we began our trip into the sunset.\
  \  \nLei told us he lived in a small village on the river and would normally swim\
  \ to work and back, I asked him about his family and here is the story he told.\
  \ \n\u201CMy parents live in a small village in Southern Laos, everyone knows eachother\
  \ and no one ever gets out. I walked into the house one day when I was 15 and my\
  \ parents introduced me to a girl I already knew, it was my friends sister, they\
  \ told me this girl was to be my wife, and the date was set for the next week. This\
  \ wasn\u2019t the life I wanted for myself, so I got together the small amount of\
  \ earnings I had and the next morning when my parents woke, I was gone. I hitchhiked\
  \ to Northern Laos where I was able to find a job helping on maintaining the river\
  \ to keep it safe for tourists to do water sports. I dreamed of working with tourists\
  \ but I knew I would never be offered that job if I didn\u2019t speak English. \
  \ A few days later I left my job and hitchhiked once again, this time to the Thai\
  \ border, here I used the money I had saved to buy English books and dictionaries\
  \ and bring them back across the border to my town. I was determined to learn English\
  \ as it is my dream to work with tourists. It was almost eight months after I had\
  \ left my family by this time, my English was passable and I was earning money,\
  \ only after this time did I make contact with my parents\u2019 village to tell\
  \ them I was safe and I was going to get a job working with tourists and everything\
  \ was okay.  My parents though, I never hear back from them.\u201D \nAs the sun\
  \ began to disappear and everything was plunged into a beautiful orange colour,\
  \ a small tear trickled down my cheek. Lei told us this is the best place to leave\
  \ the river to get to the town before dark; we hopped out of our rubber rings and\
  \ clambered up the banks. We told Lei how beautiful his story really was, and we\
  \ hoped he does open his own company one day; we would be his first customers. We\
  \ took one picture together and said goodbye, five months on and I still never forget\
  \ the connection we made on the river that day."
