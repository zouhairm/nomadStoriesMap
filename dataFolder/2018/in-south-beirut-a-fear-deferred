Text: "Deep in the south of Lebanon, in a town called Nabatieh, I met a Hezbollah\
  \ soldier for an interview about the militant group\u2019s involvement in the Syrian\
  \ War. To my surprise, the border between two of the world\u2019s most belligerent\
  \ nations looked like green mountains and pine valleys\u2014serene nature burying\
  \ last decade\u2019s bomb craters. It thrilled me to be here, so far from my daily\
  \ life as a student of Comparative Literature and Middle East Studies at Brown University,\
  \ where my knowledge of Lebanon and Israel/Palestine came from books with the word\
  \ \u201Cpedagogy\u201D in the title.\n \u201CWhat\u2019s your religion?\u201D The\
  \ soldier\u2019s question jolted me out of my trance. I hesitated. Before I left\
  \ for Beirut to work as a reporter for The Daily Star, my concerned family members\
  \ warned me not to reveal I\u2019m Jewish. Ever since I\u2019d studied Arabic and\
  \ expressed a desire to cover the Middle East, I had become accustomed to fears\
  \ flinging at me from all directions, but here in Hezbollah country, it was hard\
  \ to ignore the murals of Stars of David dripping with blood. \n Similar warnings\
  \ had followed me to Amman, Jordan the summer before. When crossing the border into\
  \ Israel, I\u2019d debated whether or not to declare my Judaism. An IDF guard wielding\
  \ a rifle interrogated me and my friend, an Egyptian-American with an Arab last\
  \ name. He asked us why we would study Arabic\u2014\u201Cthe language of ISIS,\u201D\
  \ he called it. Admitting my Judaism would have likely facilitated my smooth passage\
  \ through daily hurdles, but I felt that keeping my identity quiet allowed me to\
  \ witness a reality I never could have imagined among Palestinians in the West Bank.\
  \ In Hebron, I glimpsed a boy in a kippah, one of the Israeli settlers, glaring\
  \ at me from the Jewish side of Abraham\u2019s contested tomb. He tugged on his\
  \ mother\u2019s sleeve and pointed, and I suddenly became conscious of wearing a\
  \ hijab (as mosque etiquette requires), and speaking Arabic instead of Hebrew. I\
  \ will always remember his gaze, the strange moment of dissociation. I felt pressure\
  \ to claim some sort of allegiance: Us or them? But with a wave of relief and surge\
  \ of energy, I realized the role I most wanted to claim: travel reporter. \n Back\
  \ at the Lebanese border, this Hezbollah soldier\u2019s question felt like a test.\
  \ Yet I was curious what would happen if I told him the truth. \u201CJewish,\u201D\
  \ I said.\n \u201COh, I have some Jewish friends. It\u2019s awful so many have left\
  \ Lebanon,\u201D he responded. Disarmed, I thought to myself, therein lies the promise\
  \ and power of a good story."
