Text: "For me, that I have been always traveling all around the world from China to\
  \ New York passing through Tunisia and living in Spain, the idea of not being able\
  \ anymore to take a flight \u2013 or a train, or a boat, or any type of means of\
  \ transport \u2013 was just horrific.\nThe doctor verdict was talking about \u201C\
  anxiety\u201D, a word that in my life - till that moment and before my first panic\
  \ attack on a train - was just a reference to a sort of stress, maybe because of\
  \ the university, work, sentimental problems and so on. That word, instead, was\
  \ now blocking my entire life, starting from my studies and ending with the simple\
  \ possibility to take my car and move in Lake Como\u2019s proximities, where I was\
  \ born and were I still live, a territory of water, fresh air, mountains where one\
  \ of the most famous romances of all time has been settled and written (\u201CI\
  \ Promessi Sposi\u201D, by Manzoni).\nTime was passing by, and the only thing I\
  \ was thinking about was: \u201CI won\u2019t travel anymore\u201D. The fear of new\
  \ panic attacks and an increasing anxiety - connected to the new fear of closed\
  \ spaces, and open spaces with too many people, or generally all sort of unknown\
  \ spaces - were representing the end of my dream-life: to move and tell stories,\
  \ to narrate other people\u2019s lives, to be a journalist on the road. I was spending\
  \ most of the time in remembering all my experiences: the annual trip with the children\
  \ of my parish to the Vatican City and Rome, the year of my life as an Erasmus student\
  \ in Madrid, the beauties of Beijing and Shanghai visited with my parents as well\
  \ as my study holiday in the USA; and going on\u2026 the bus travel in Andalusia\
  \ - sleeping in hostels and taking 8 hours on each trip -, the \u201CBla bla car\u201D\
  \ experience to Valencia, the incredible people met all around Europe (from Portugal\
  \ to Croatia, from Ireland to the UK) as well as the unaccompanied minors met in\
  \ Turin, and the hosting families of Bochum and Salzburg.\nBeing in treatment for\
  \ many months helped me in getting my old life back. As traveling was still a big\
  \ trouble, a big occasion was approaching: the World Youth Day of 2016, an appointment\
  \ that for me and my friends had a very important meaning. But this was also a real\
  \ challenge for me: a place full of people, millions of young people, all together\
  \ in a place where I have never been before with the necessity of traveling. This\
  \ was the moment in which I took the decision that pushed me to the edge, or better\
  \ to life again: find the courage and take that plane to re-start my life."
