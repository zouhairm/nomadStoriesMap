Text: "Tears - of awe and bewilderment you must understand - began to fall. The golden\
  \ spin of prayer wheels blurred my periphery, safe guarding this bubble of absolute\
  \ presence. At this moment all that existed was now. As the monk blessed me with\
  \ his scriptures, I surrendered with closed eyes and rigid posture. The deep, incomprehensible\
  \ chant that escaped his lips began to slow. We rose from the cushions and made\
  \ our way through the maze of Tibetan flags. A mix of red, yellow, blue, green and\
  \ white material: nature\u2019s colours hanging from the ceiling.\n\nI\u2019d ventured\
  \ to Inner Mongolia to learn, like most tourists, more about the culture. Happening\
  \ upon a Buddhist Lamasery in the centre of Hohhot was unexpected. This autonomous\
  \ region has been dominated by the Chinese for over 60 years. With Mongolian culture\
  \ somewhat suffocated and a history rich in religious scrutiny; this shimmering\
  \ temple lured me like a child to fire. \n\nNow here I stood craning my neck to\
  \ see the face of a golden Buddha staring down at me. If this was a spiritual interrogation,\
  \ at least he was smiling. My monk friend waited patiently in the archway, unaware\
  \ that I had spotted him tapping on his iPhone.\n \nTo solidify the concept of a\
  \ 21st century monk further; he ushered me over with open arms. Who was I to decline\
  \ a blessing and a hug in the same day? My awkward demeanour caused my embrace to\
  \ resemble one meant for a dear friend, rather than an acquaintance. Even so, as\
  \ his left arm slid down my back and landed on my bum (giving it a wobble for good\
  \ measure), I leapt back in shock. \n\nI should have been appalled. I probably should\
  \ have sounded the alarm. Instead, I inwardly giggled at his expression. Like the\
  \ face of a man that has concluded a delightful, yet unremarkable exchange of conversation;\
  \ he stood there looking rather indifferent. Perhaps I gave him the wrong impression.\
  \ Perhaps he took advantage of the situation. Either way, our dinner conversation\
  \ that night would cause equal humour to open ears.\n\nThis local encounter did\
  \ well to remind me of something important: no matter the outer appearance or individual\
  \ life choice, ultimately all we are is human. As a female solo traveller, sometimes\
  \ it\u2019s necessary to remember to take a moment before jumping in to every opportunity\
  \ with open, trusting arms."
