Text: "What would make a 23 year old girl walk 600km by herself in 40 degree heat\
  \ for a month straight? Camping on the side of the road & sleeping on the ground.\
  \ Did someone make her do this? Was she held hostage and someone told her if she\
  \ didn\u2019t walk 600km they were going to kill her? Was she doing it for charity\
  \ or was she doing it for fitness? Or was it none of the above & she was just simply\
  \ doing it because she was bored & wanted to test herself. She wanted to show the\
  \ world that when you step out of your comfort zone it will change you. It will\
  \ also make you appreciate the little things in life like a car, a microwave, a\
  \ pudding cup and even the company of friends and family?\n\nI had been walking\
  \ 2 days straight through basically what felt like it was a desert. I hadn\u2019\
  t put into the equation that I wouldn\u2019t hit a town where I could top up water\
  \ for another 24 hours. I had ran out of water and was so thirsty. I didn\u2019\
  t know what to do. My theory was if I ate enough pudding cups it would rehydrate\
  \ me. I ate 5 pudding cups, it didn\u2019t rehydrate me, but dang they were delicious!\
  \ I started feeling really dizzy and couldn\u2019t see properly. That day I had\
  \ to resort to drinking water out of a dam. Dam water. I even felt like the cows\
  \ were judging me. I got down on my hands and knees and just surrendered, I laid\
  \ there for hours butt naked in a dam in the middle of nowhere, no one around to\
  \ judge me, just me, myself & nature. I knew if I could get through this, I could\
  \ get through anything. Obviously I didn\u2019t know the worst was yet to come.\n\
  \nI finally had crossed the border from Victoria to NSW! The moment I crossed the\
  \ border, I chucked my bag down & slipped on my flip flops. I felt SO free. I remember\
  \ walking back to where I hid my bag an hour later.\n\u2018OH CRAP\u2019 I gasped\
  \ when I rocked up to the spot where i hid it.\n\nAll that was left was my towel\
  \ & my hat.\n\nGone\u2026.\nEVERYTHING\u2026..\nMy bag, my tent, my gopro, my underwear,\
  \ my money, my food, my clothes\u2026..EVERYTHING. \n\nI was stuck there all alone\
  \ as the sun set with nothing, just the clothes on my back. What is the one thing\
  \ you would do, if all your things got stolen? You were stranded by yourself? Well\
  \ I did the most logical thing I could in that situation\u2026..\n\nIf you want\
  \ to continue to read my story of my 600km walk , I have just started up my own\
  \ travel blogging website and the full story is in the following link:\n\nhttp://aimeeadventures.com/blog/melbourne-to-canberra-solo-walk/"
