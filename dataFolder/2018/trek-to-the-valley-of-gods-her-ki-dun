Text: "After years of failed holiday planning, when friends suddenly call & compel\
  \ you to be a part of a Himalayan trek, you say YES! How can one say no to the Himalayas\
  \ & company of crazy friends? So, I agreed without questioning what was in store\
  \ for me.\n\nThe Trek prep involved exercising to ensure that the altitude of 13,000\
  \ ft. above sea level would be easy to scale. And so began the stair climbs, squats,\
  \ running, etc. I thought I was as fit as a horse, ready to take on Har ki Dun valley.\
  \ This illusion was short lived.\n\nDespite recovering from flu a week prior to\
  \ the trek, my cough returned making it difficult to breathe while climbing. Unfortunately,\
  \ the first two days of the trek were majorly ascends. My oxygen & BP levels were\
  \ in control which confirmed I didn\u2019t suffer from AMS. However, my clogged\
  \ lungs were unprepared for the pure air. \n\nBeing the last person on the trail\
  \ caused me to lose sight of my group many times which lead me to question my decision\
  \ to join this trek. I wondered if I should quit climbing & wait as the trekkers\
  \ made their way back. However, when such thoughts crossed my mind, I would look\
  \ across the valley, at the mighty mountains & think about how they had witnessed\
  \ & withstood it all. I could hear birds chirp & the cattle cry; the crystal-clear\
  \ gushing river & my inner voice say-\"I\u2019m here to befriend these mountains.\
  \ I can & will do it!\"\n\nWhile at Har ki Dun campsite, the weather turned nasty\
  \ with winds blowing & temperatures dropping. Hailing from the city of Mumbai &\
  \ being accustomed to the humid weather, I was freezing here despite my warm layers.\
  \ Even as I sat close to a bonfire, sipping hot soup, my oxygen & BP levels dropped\
  \ & I was advised to take Diamox tablet. \n\nSince I had the tablet post dinner,\
  \ I rouse 3 times in the dead of the night to urinate. In the freezing weather,\
  \ with sheets of ice forming on the tents, I had to step out & walk for a minute\
  \ to take a bio-break. On each return, I felt my heart beat racing for fear of dying\
  \ out in the cold.\n\nWe began our descend next morning. The medication ensured\
  \ my good health. I was able to enjoy the rest of my trek. I walked at a slow pace\
  \ to enjoy the natural scenic view & spoke with many people as I descended the trail.\
  \ There couldn\u2019t have been a lovelier experience, especially since the trekkers\
  \ were well past the age of 60!\n\n\u201CIn any given moment we have two options-to\
  \ step forward into growth or to step back into safety\u201D Abraham Maslow.\nBy\
  \ now you know the path I chose."
