Text: "After three weeks in Goa, I wanted to stay longer. The cheaper option was to\
  \ rent a house rather than hotel. I wanted space and freedom and after days of searching,\
  \ the choice came down to a beautiful apartment or an old traditional Portuguese,\
  \ Goan house surrounded by palm trees and garden, with a sandy path leading down\
  \ to the beach. \u201CGo for the traditional house, they told me. Everyone wants\
  \ the real Goa experience, they said\u201D. A snap decision was made to take the\
  \ huge old house with its high-pitched airy beamed roof, making it cooler through\
  \ the months ahead. I had wanted more nature and beach, so it was perfect. I was\
  \ up for this new experience!\nThe first night, a number of geckos congregated around\
  \ the lights for evening tea, bugs that I had yet to identify swarmed around the\
  \ huge room. I retreated to my mosquito net. I heard loud rustling noises coming\
  \ from inside the house, but I daren\u2019t leave the safety of the net to find\
  \ out what it was. After many nights of imaginary scenarios, I finally gathered\
  \ the courage to get up and find out. As I watched palm leaves being dragged in\
  \ through the roof, I discovered that squirrels were nesting above my kitchen sink!\
  \ Even the toilet wasn\u2019t safe, the resident frog lived there and no matter\
  \ how many times I danced around with the broom to flick him outside, he was insistent\
  \ that he liked it there. No fun when you need the bathroom at 2 am! The nights\
  \ were filled with strange animal calls and sounds of the wild. The rafters were\
  \ the extension of outside, mice ran across the top, squirrels scurried along the\
  \ walls. Geckos would often fall from the rafters with a splat and the frogs also\
  \ dropped in through the airy gaps, making their way to the bathroom. \nAs I sat\
  \ on the floor cushions of my traditional Goan dream house, brushing my arms of\
  \ insects traversing cushion mountain, I was on the edge, nowhere was safe or bug-free,\
  \ I felt itchy. As mosquitos buzzed around my ears and ants of all sizes went about\
  \ their organised business, I started to question the comfortability of the dream.\
  \ As I tucked my net around me, I wondered if my decision was the right one. How\
  \ was I going to cope for three months? It was true that I had wanted more nature,\
  \ I recalled as I peered through my netted cage, it was one of the reasons I came\
  \ here. As I looked around, it was clear that Nature had responded, softly blowing\
  \ her message through the breeze that cooled the room. \u201CHere I am, she had\
  \ replied, delivered right inside your home\u201D."
