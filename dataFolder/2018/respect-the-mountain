Text: "Respect the Mountain. Small or big, magnificent or simple - always obey the\
  \ rule. \n\nI was drugged with the smell of freedom and forgot that the freedom\
  \ has to be earned. I owe the freedom to the mountains and all I felt was the cold\
  \ wind biting my cheeks and lips, my snowboard getting heavier with every second\
  \ and the sweet smell of adrenalin running through my veins.  There was only me,\
  \ my snowboard and the mountain Ruapehu. \n\nIt was time to put the board on let\
  \ myself be as free as the wind and freestyle my way down. I clipped the snowboard\
  \ on and drifted away from the pick of the mountain down to the unknown, ignoring\
  \ all the warning signs. Green, yellow, red, black. My desire for an adventure was\
  \ bigger than any common cautiousness. \n\nAnd then I slipped, I fell, I rolled,\
  \ I kept going down further and further. All I felt beneath was the icy surface\
  \ and nothing to grip onto. Finally, I stopped. There was nothing around me, no\
  \ one was there, but the ice and the small patches of snow. I took my snowboard\
  \ off and realized that the mountain's angle is too sharp to walk or jump on. I\
  \ used my snowboard as an alpine axe, cutting into harsh ice. Two steps up and one\
  \ step down. I started giving up, hot tears were freezing on my cheeks and my arms\
  \ were getting weaker and weaker. I felt sorry for myself, I felt pity, I cried\
  \ but no one cared, the mountain didn't care. \n\nI stopped. I thought about the\
  \ future, about the people who will miss me, about the parents who don't even know\
  \ I am here, the friends who will be devastated and the people who loved me, the\
  \ people who taught me to be strong, the enemies who made me even stronger. The\
  \ laughs, the love, the warmth, the comfort, the trust, the sadness, the tears,\
  \ the coldness, the grief. I was yet to experience all that again. I started crawling\
  \ up, I wanted to live.  \n\nThat day I survived. The mountain got closed ten minutes\
  \ after my arrival. I was lucky that day. Today, I love my life, I appreciate every\
  \ moment and I strive to live it at its fullest. Mt.Ruapehu taught me the lesson\
  \ I will never forget \u2013 you must always respect the Mountain."
