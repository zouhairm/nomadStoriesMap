Text: "Rain lashed against my skin, each drop leaving a mosaic of goosebumps on my\
  \ skin. Around me the owners of the market stalls started bundling their wares into\
  \ bags and seeking refuge from the sudden downpour.\n\nMimicking the merchants,\
  \ I scampered to find somewhere to shelter from the celestial waterfall. As I turned\
  \ a corner, a sign caught my attention. I was instantly drawn to it like a dehydrated\
  \ wanderer spying an oasis amongst the desert dunes. The sign only had one word\
  \ written on it. Libraire.\n\nA small bell tinkled overheard as I pushed the door\
  \ open and entered. Whether we realise it or not, we all have weaknesses. Sentimental\
  \ attractions that we cannot hope to escape. From a young age, my weakness has been\
  \ books. Now I found myself inside an Aladdin\u2019s cave full of my weaknesses.\
  \ Under a pale high-vaulted ceiling, a forest of brown and white shelves sagged\
  \ under the weight of thousands of books. It was only when I stooped to examine\
  \ the books that I noticed they were all French.\n\nI was so engrossed trying to\
  \ decipher the titles that I did not notice a small man emerge from behind one of\
  \ the bookshelves. Recognising that I was not a local, he did not bother trying\
  \ to converse in Lithuanian but instead greeted me in French. Words, grammar and\
  \ syntax that I had not used in the seven years since my last French class flooded\
  \ through my mind as I tried to string together intelligible sentences in order\
  \ to communicate with him.\n\nSlowly, the remnants of a thousand forgotten French\
  \ lessons coalesced and the words began to slide off my tongue more fluidly. Marvelling\
  \ at how this seed of France had taken root in Lithuania, I asked him how he had\
  \ come to open his store. He told me that he had inherited his love of French literature\
  \ from his polyglot parents who had been professors of foreign literature before\
  \ the Soviet occupation during World War II. Despite the difficulty of obtaining\
  \ foreign books due to oppressive Soviet censorship regulations, his love of the\
  \ French classics blossomed. Upon Lithuania gaining independence, he had decided\
  \ to open up his store.\n\nThe rest of my time in this literary utopia passed in\
  \ a blur. I followed him amongst the shelves whilst he imparted his encyclopaedic\
  \ knowledge of literature to me. Occasionally he would pluck a book from a shelf\
  \ and hand it to me to peruse. Eventually the storm passed and the time came for\
  \ me to leave. So with an armful of books and promise to return, I walked out into\
  \ the puddle-filled street."
