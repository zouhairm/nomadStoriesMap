Text: "A storm surge of emotions shadowing my mind as the cruiser pulls up to the\
  \ matusadona. Golden yellow grass waving back at me across the savanna, dry dead\
  \ earth reaking of an unsaturated dust. A distinct smell lingered in the air, it\
  \ was the the smell of wildlife. \n\nThe time had finally come, I was going to experience\
  \ the secrets of the matusadona rangers. The men that trained day and night endlessly\
  \ devoting their lives to the conservation of the rhino were going to entroduce\
  \ me to one of the biggest most beautiful animals on the landscape. A lust for blood\
  \ makes it ever so obvious as to why only a select few ever get to experience the\
  \ hidden agenda of such magnificent beasts. Animals so protected that anyone seen\
  \ on the African land are shot dead on sight. No arrests, no room for poachers to\
  \ return. Security so tight that no one but the rangers know how many rhinos are\
  \ even in the area, not even I was allowed to know this. This life for them is a\
  \ war in itself blood vs blood, the only way they know how.  A secret reserve that\
  \ I was finally going to experience, an encounter that would come about once in\
  \ a lifetime. \n\nThe morning came, strict instructions on what to wear, camo gear,\
  \ almost an army styled attire, mudded up bodies stealthily crept through the bush\
  \ in search of the almighty creature of legend. The black rhino, an animal so rare\
  \ that it\u2019s believed the entire species will become extinct in under 5 years.\
  \ Reason enough to understand the dedication to the conservation. We scattered our\
  \ eyes peeled wide open always in constant awareness of the surroundings, always\
  \ in preparation of the worst possible scenario. Automatic assault rifles wrapped\
  \ around the shoulders of the scouts. Never ending attention focussed on the mission\
  \ at hand. No phones, no cameras no distractions no evidence no reason to question\
  \ the liability of the animals. The time was now, it was now or never.\n\nThe magnificent\
  \ animal emerges through the grass like a huge stealthy grey entity, so large it\
  \ engulfs the surroundings. The gentle giant ever so graceful in its element. So\
  \ peaceful, tranquil and bliss almost a picture of perfection."
