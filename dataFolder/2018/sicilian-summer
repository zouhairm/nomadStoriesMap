Text: "The car picks up speed and the slightly opened window allows the deep, pulsating\
  \ voice of the wind to delicately pound of my eardrums. To my right, the sun\u2019\
  s late afternoon rays transform the vast Conca d\u2019ora valley into a glistening\
  \ palette. Not a week earlier, I beheld this same valley, standing atop the lookout\
  \ tower of Duomo di Monreale. Perched less than 10 kilometers south of Sicily\u2019\
  s famed capital, Palermo, this place boasts more Byzantine mosaics than any other\
  \ church in Italy. Monreale\u2019s 800-year-old, high, richly-decorated ceilings\
  \ retell scenes of the Bible in deep blues and vivid golds, harmoniously complemented\
  \ by subtly loud ruby accents. I\u2019m suddenly uncomfortable at the slightly too-warm\
  \ August heat seeping into the car and my mind is redirected to endless days in\
  \ the Mediterranean. \u201CIl mare non \xE8 bene oggi,\u201D states my cousin Gianni.\
  \ As we submerge into the pristine, turquoise waters of Franchesi beach, I laugh\
  \ at his disapproval. Never have I allowed my limbs to become so exhausted from\
  \ pulling through the sea\u2019s stubborn resistance or floated on its salty surface\
  \ so peacefully as the beads of salt sizzle and pop in my ears. Then again, never\
  \ have I spent a day in the ocean, and had a full course meal waiting on the shore.\
  \ I marvel at the scene \u2014 old men chowing down on mortadella-filled panini,\
  \ still-dripping kids grabbing Nutella-splattered bread, and women carefully peeling\
  \ the ripest pears and plump peaches of the summer season before devouring them.\
  \ Back in the food-less backseat, my eyes wander upwards to the clouds, graceful\
  \ and elegant in the too-perfectly blue sky, a sudden feeling of jealousy towards\
  \ them takes over. I\u2019m envious that they can drift over any part of this masterpiece\
  \ they call Sicily. If they so desire, they can float to the northernmost tip of\
  \ this Southern island to the shores of Cefal\xF9. They can gaze down upon the brilliant,\
  \ patterned umbrellas protecting already too-tan beachgoers. Cefal\xF9 \u2014 inundated\
  \ with speedo-wearing men, aged 6 to 60, shore-docked blue and red-striped fishing\
  \ boats, and an overly-animated vendor hollering a catchy tune about his \u201C\
  fresh, crunchy coconut.\u201D But Cefal\xFA is over an hour away now and an airport\
  \ sign welcomes us. The last thing I expected was to be wiping away unrelenting,\
  \ overly emotional tears as I wave off family I met merely 3 weeks prior. An new\
  \ immense pride and adoration for my true motherland is almost as fulfilling as\
  \ the plate of Pasta Al Forno I enjoyed the night prior."
