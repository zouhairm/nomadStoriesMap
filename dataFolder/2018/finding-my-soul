Text: "Here we go! I am crying, I am sitting on the airplane admiring the sky, the\
  \ clouds, leaving my country and wondering what is going to happen?\n\nThe fear\
  \ is always the worst feeling you can feel but at the same time this feeling set\
  \ you free. I am flying, I am free. I am here.\n\nI have been saving money for years\
  \ to make this happen, searching how to find your \"special gift\", how to find\
  \ you, how to find yourself, your dreams, the spark that make you feel alive, that\
  \ keep you moving. Who are your family, who are your friends, who are you? What\
  \ are you doing here? Why do you need to belong to a country when you can be a citizen\
  \ of this lovely world. \n\nWell, someday I will figure it out, or maybe not. For\
  \ now, let's keep walking, searching, living, enjoying every minute, every breath,\
  \ every word, action and thought. I am in a unknown country, a different language,\
  \ new people, new culture, new music, new food, all I wanted, all I was looking\
  \ for. \nCreating a new life, a new me or maybe finding my \"me\".  \n\nAll these\
  \ buildings seems familiar to me, I think I remember them from the TV and movies\
  \ I used to watched all the time, all the history I read and listened since I was\
  \ a kid. There is a smell on the streets, there is a look on their eyes, I would\
  \ love to create a poem of every single detail. I feel incredible, I am lost.\n\n\
  Here is where my journey starts and I hope to continue until I die. My mind is a\
  \ book, all these pages, drawings, colours and pencils. All this love make me wanna\
  \ dance, but I need to start answering all my questions, I need to start with my\
  \ plan: talk with real people, double check with them if all I want to know is worthily,\
  \ is it necessary?, it will take me away?.\n\nSometimes I think I am living on a\
  \ world that I don't understand because I would love to live to make everybody else\
  \ happy, to be happy. Anyway, I am at a tea shop (one of the reasons I am here),\
  \ the amount of tea boxes is unpredictable, all sizes and colours, all tastes and\
  \ prices and I keep writing.\nIt is crazy how many pages I can write in one day.\
  \ It is crazy how many stories I heard, how many faces I saw, how I can't still\
  \ find an standard sound.\n\nThe tea is magic, warm and cold. I feel that talks\
  \ to me when I try to listen to what my body is feeling with each sip. I have been\
  \ living on this country for a month now, everything is taking shape, it has more\
  \ sense, I feel this is the start for something great, the last thing I expected\
  \ to find was there in that window."
