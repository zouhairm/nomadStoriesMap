Text: "When my mom arrives from Moscow to Madrid to visit me, we usually escape to\
  \ places that we\u2019ve never been before. This time was not an exception. After\
  \ trying to find some fewer expenses travel in Spain, we decided to change our destination\
  \ and just took tickets to Lisboa. Normally, due to my logistics studies I plan\
  \ and organize daily our trips, but that time my emotional level was low and also\
  \ was busy working.We decided that this time my mom organize places that we should\
  \ visit. I knew that she has got an amazing taste, but never knew that those places\
  \ that she had chosen will inspire me that much. So one of the days, we just packed\
  \ some sandwiches, took some extra tog and went to the unknown destination. We arrived\
  \ at the small city called Cintra by train. Rapidly, we found a restaurant where\
  \ we took an amazing cup of coffee with delicious raspberries cake. When we wanted\
  \ to write our review about the place on a famous platform, we were shocked. Don\u2019\
  t know how, but we've got talent to find best places. This restaurant was a most\
  \ rated place in the city. Full and happy we went to find a bus that should take\
  \ us to Cabo da Roca. At the beginning, I was not understanding where we are going,\
  \ but we took that bus. It was my crazies experience in bus ever, he fully entertains\
  \ people for that money. Seeing ocean, landscapes, small villages, nature of the\
  \ place. Wonderful. Until the moment when the bus started going on narrow streets.\
  \ Me praying to not fall down from the mountain. Tourists taking photos. Bus driver\
  \ trying to do the best, but... When he tried to part ways with a truck, even sleeping\
  \ Japanese tourist started filming. Drivers shouting, people crazy for the action,\
  \ shocked. \xA1After 10 minutes of shouts and laughs, finally we continued! We arrived\
  \ at this place, lots of people walking around, taking pictures. I\u2019m a professional\
  \ for finding best spots to sit, so I did this time. I sit on the hillside, my mum\
  \ repeated. I took out our sandwiches, clothed myself completely from the ocean\
  \ wind; and there sitting in the last point of Europe, eating homemade food, you\
  \ understand that you don\u2019t need that much to feel alive and happy. Your family\
  \ near to you, birds flying around, no wifi around, calm, old lighthouse. From kilometres\
  \ altitude you see waves beating stones, fish jumping from the water. The eternal\
  \ calm and peace in your soul and body. So you understand that you are in the best\
  \ place ever seen. Since then I love spontaneity and our low-cost trips."
