Text: "The year was 2004. I visited Marrakesh in early spring with my friend. He was\
  \ working in British Airways at the time. He knew that I was going through a tough\
  \ time due to the death of a cousin of mine in Kashmir Pakistan. I was very close\
  \ to my cousin who I had spent a lot of time with only months before. So her death\
  \ was a terrible shock to say the least.\n\nIn Marrakesh we did the usual tour of\
  \ visiting the beautiful city, trying the local cuisine and enjoying a show depicting\
  \ the nomad warriors of an era gone by. But I was looking forward to the desert\
  \ ride. But if truth be told my heart was not in the holiday despite my friend's\
  \ best efforts.\n\nOn the third day we planned a desert excursion on quad bikes\
  \ with a group of other travellers. the plan was to ride through the desert and\
  \ visit a village at the edge of the desert, where we will have a chance to sample\
  \ the authentic culture and hospitality of Marrakesh. \n\nThe desert ride and seeing\
  \ nomads en-route did remind me of my childhood trips to Kashmir. Driving on dusty\
  \ roads, seeing mountains in the distance always spurred on my imaginations. However\
  \ what transpired next was even beyond my wildest imagination.  We arrived at this\
  \ village, filled with houses made of clay. The design of the village, the children\
  \ playing around and looking at us with curiosity was a scene just like when I visited\
  \ Kashmir a few months ago. We parked our quad bikes and went inside one of the\
  \ designated houses who were there to host us. Entering the veranda, looking at\
  \ the clay pots and how people were dressed was as if I had been transported to\
  \ Kashmir. Of course non of us spoke the local language except for our tour guide.\
  \ I guess being in a village that reminded me of my ancestral place where I saw\
  \ my cousin the last time was too much for me to bear. It wasn't long before I started\
  \ to sob. Everyone was looking at me thinking what had overcome me. My friend explained\
  \ to the tour what I had been going through. The tour guide explained this to our\
  \ host. The elderly lady of the house came and sat next to me and started consoling\
  \ me as I broke down completely. She said to me via the tour guide that I can stay\
  \ here for as long as I want and that one day I will see my cousin again. \n\nNow\
  \ when I look back I can only wonder at how such a connection was made in all places\
  \ a desert in a foreign land."
