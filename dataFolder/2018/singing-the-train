Text: "She sang in low flowing guttural tones and rhythmically rasped a flattened\
  \ coke can with a dollar coin- \u2018shuk-a-shuk-a-shuk\u2019 went the beat like\
  \ a train. I clicked my fingers under the hot Outback sun, running out of fuel wasn\u2019\
  t so bad after all.\n\nThe fuel needle swung over \u2018E\u2019 like a pendulum\
  \ as I rolled into Marble Bar, a Pilbara town that makes up for its misleading lack\
  \ of marble by the presence of a bar- The Marble Bar Roadhouse; pub, gas station\
  \ and motel all rolled into one. That\u2019s where I met Genna.\n\nMy ears cocked\
  \ to the sound of her singing as I stepped out of the jalopy. Quartz that speckled\
  \ the red rocky land like hailstones crunched underfoot as I walked over to the\
  \ bench where she sat.\n\n\u2018What are you singing?\u2019 I asked.\n\n\u2018Nyamal\
  \ song, by Mangkayipirti\u2019.\n\nI\u2019d heard Oz has more languages than Europe,\
  \ and I\u2019ll bet I\u2019d come across the one with the most difficult pronunciations-Nyamal.\
  \ The artist\u2019s name bounced around my mouth as I tried to say it. She laughed,\
  \ waving her hands as though fanning air away from herself.\n\n\u2018Larry Brown\
  \ to you fellas. Singing the old train from Port Hedland to Marble Bar\u2019.\n\n\
  As she sang, heat rose from the widely spaced metal roofed houses as though they\
  \ were swaying to the music.\n\nJinyjipajarnu warranpa jarangkunu\nThe country keeps\
  \ going fast,\n\nMurti pilurru\nComing up fast,\n\nPajanpinyjarnu ngartarra\nFoot\
  \ stamping\n\nPinkarta jinyjipajarnu\nOn the pedal.\n\nTurns out Larry Brown had\
  \ traveled on the Spinifex Express, and sang his way across Western Australia, taking\
  \ in the creeks, hills, and watering holes in the lyrics of an Indigenous song style\
  \ called a Japi. Seventy years on since the steam train\u2019s last voyage and Genna\
  \ is one of less than twenty remaining that can speak Nyamal. But she\u2019s still\
  \ singing the train, keeping the experience alive.\n\nI learned a few words after\
  \ hearing the song, which I practiced with her until her old brown face wrinkled\
  \ into a smile and she clapped her hands. Delicate bush flowers swayed it the breeze,\
  \ celebrating my elocution.\n\nGenna waved as I went into the roadhouse to settle\
  \ up. Heat radiated from the pie warmer, the only music the hum of the cold drinks\
  \ machine. I exercised my Nyamal on the cashier. He was baffled. I gave it one more\
  \ shot, before switching to English and asking \u2018how much?\u2019\n\n\u2018Thirty\
  \ seven dollars mate\u2019.\n\nI sighed as I withdrew blue and red bills, glancing\
  \ out the window towards the empty bench. Here I was, only metres away from the\
  \ source, and the connection was gone."
