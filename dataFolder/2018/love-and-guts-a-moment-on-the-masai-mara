Text: "I was crouched between two buses, vomiting amidst the vast expanse of the Masai\
  \ Mara. In the pause between retches, I glimpsed the vibrant belt of green grass\
  \ where giant greys drank, the white egrets perched gracefully on their backs unperturbed\
  \ by the intermittent flap of flag-sized ears. The first rule of this part of Amboseli\
  \ National Park: Do not get out of the bus! I had to appreciate my precarious but\
  \ unique position out there, unsheltered, in the land of thunderous hooves across\
  \ silent plains.\n \nWe had been in camp only a few days, two dozen westerners accompanied\
  \ by twenty young yoga teachers from the slums of Nairobi. We had practiced together,\
  \ mat to mat, in the downtown center that offered free classes, threading our obvious\
  \ cultural and character differences into similar shapes in our bodies. One of the\
  \ teachers had arranged for us to build a school in his community, a remote Masai\
  \ village. \n\nThe bumpy half day drive passed with laughter and uncertainty, conversations\
  \ ebbing and flowing, marked by shouts of excitement for gazelles leaping across\
  \ the dusty road or a giraffe in the distance. Our camp, with plenty of fresh water\
  \ and catered food, was a luxurious anomaly in the apparent desolation around us.\
  \ We kept our shoes on to avoid the treacherous burrs spread across the landscape\
  \ like landmines. I woke each morning for coffee with the warrior guarding camp\
  \ as he stoked the last embers of the fire. \u201CAny animals last night?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \u201CJust hyenas,\u201D he replied plainly, tingling my every nerve.\
  \ \n\nWe made quick work of the school with rudimentary tools, mixing mortar on\
  \ the ground with shovels and water and setting stones at the command of local masons.\
  \ Masai men, draped in layers of red cloth and beaded necklaces, sat in groups watching\
  \ the women tie re-bar with metal wire and handsaw wood for the desks. Little boys\
  \ as sturdy as the cattle they drove made their way across the scene from time to\
  \ time. We finished with high-fives, hugs, and handstands and looked forward to\
  \ the next day's safari, but that evening I endured such a ferocious fever I wondered\
  \ if I'd make it through the night.\n\nYet here I was, feeling more alive, connected,\
  \ and grateful than I ever had, even as I vomited. With that thought, I took in\
  \ one last view of the motherland, gathered myself, and stepped back on the bus.\
  \ Casually I asked, \u201CAnyone want a kiss?\u201D Our bus full of new friends\
  \ burst out laughing, welcomed me back to my seat, but kindly declined."
