Text: "\u201CY tu novia?\u201D Isabela asked. \u201CTienes una novia, no?\u201D\n\n\
  I hesitated. \u201CNo. Ya no.\u201D \n\nThrough empty glasses slick with sour foam\
  \ I looked at the smile and into the eyes of a young Chilean woman and over the\
  \ sounds of live music and inebriated conversation, I lied. No, no girl back home.\
  \ It frightened me that love could be so easily dismissed. How quickly and spinelessly\
  \ I could sacrifice it to her coquettish accent, the tightness of her clothes, my\
  \ own smirking mischief. I excused myself.\n\n\u201CDe donde eres?\u201D slurred\
  \ a man next to me at the urinal trough.\n\n\u201CSoy Canadiense.\u201D\n \nThe\
  \ concrete walls were partly tiled with stained, cracked white squares, but they\
  \ ended suddenly as if the worker who\u2019d installed them had received an emergency\
  \ call and never returned. The floor, too, was concrete, split open by an earthquake\
  \ so the ground beneath could plainly be seen. Graffiti plastered the walls and\
  \ the distressed aluminum toilet stalls: revolutionary Chilean poetry and phrases,\
  \ some relating to the fomenting student protests and some to the Pinochet dictatorship\
  \ of decades past. \n\n\u201CCanadiense-shun! Que choclo,\u201D he said.\n\nI washed\
  \ my hands. Splashed water on my face. Wondered if the city, in extreme drought,\
  \ could reuse the water draining into corroded pipes. La Serena, nestled between\
  \ the Andes and the ocean such that a dense fog entombed it nearly every morning,\
  \ used finely-meshed netting on their crops to capture moisture from the air. But\
  \ closer to the ocean, the fog mixed with the sea, rendering it useless. Seawater\
  \ desalination was being developed to combat the rapidly depleting reservoir in\
  \ Valle de Elqui to the east.\n\nIsabela waited for me at the bar with Clara, Luis,\
  \ and Leo. We went back to my place where we could listen to records and drink pisco\
  \ from the bottle.\nShe and Clara slept in my bed and I slept on the floor in another\
  \ room. I felt this would remove temptation and leave me blameless. But I awoke\
  \ to her under my blanket with me and she said, \u201CHola,\u201D and kissed me.\
  \ A real kiss. Hard. Passionate. I took my time removing myself.\n\nWe had lunch\
  \ once after, and it was a nice lunch: ceviche and red wine. I told her I was leaving\
  \ Chile and apologised for my indiscretion. Admitted that in fact I did have a girlfriend\
  \ whom I loved very much. \n\nIsabela seemed unphased. \u201CEstaba solo un beso,\u201D\
  \ she said. \n\nSophie hadn\u2019t agreed. \u201CJust a kiss?\u201D she\u2019d asked\
  \ contemptuously when I got home. Mockingly. A terrifying thing to hear: hatred\
  \ in the voice of someone you love."
