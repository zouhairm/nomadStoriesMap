Text: "In her youth my mother had lived and loved Santorini. But the prospects of\
  \ getting a university degree forced her to move back to Denmark, where I\u2019\
  m from. It took her 19 years to return; this time with two children by her side.\
  \  \n\nClusters of small bright white houses with roofs like the blue sky arched\
  \ on top, scattered. This is the colour scheme that makes Santorini. But the colour\
  \ that stands vivid in my memory, is a sun-ripened red.\n\nWe were staying at a\
  \ small B&B in the outskirts of Fire. There were no more than twelve rooms, all\
  \ next to each other with the front doors facing a small swimming pool in the middle.\
  \ The B&B was a family-owned business, as most businesses in Santorini are. The\
  \ wife sat in the reception all day - every day. On some days her daughter would\
  \ join her, but besides her, the only other family member in the house was the grandfather.\n\
  \nThe first time I saw him, my heart skipped a beat. Everything about him reminded\
  \ me of my own grandfather. His skin was darkened from a lifetime in the sun; his\
  \ body was tiny and old, but planted in the middle of his face a big grin was constantly\
  \ visible. A black, bushy moustache sat on top of it. \n\nI instantly felt connected\
  \ with him. Despite an age gap spanding not just thousands of miles, but a lifetime,\
  \ he and I became friends. One day he came to my mom, as we were leaving to go to\
  \ the city. The grandfather insisted we came along. \u201CHe wants to show you something,\u201D\
  \ my mom explained. We all went around to an empty garage at the back of the house.\
  \ The walls where covered in white. A small wooden table with an old fruit press\
  \ stood in the middle. And in front of it, a woven basket filled to the brim with\
  \ bright, red tomatoes. \n\nThe grandfather held the tomato to my face, smiling\
  \ and waiting for my reaction. The size of the fruit made it look like it was about\
  \ to burst. The skin was sparkling in the sun light. He then took the tomato, put\
  \ it in the press, and squeezed. Just then I noticed the jar beneath, filling with\
  \ juice and pulp. \u201CHe is making tomato sauce the traditional way\u201D my mom\
  \ explained. In that moment, I understood. A big secret had been revealed to me.\
  \ I had been granted exclusive insight into an ancient ritual. \nBefore we left,\
  \ he leaned in and placed a kiss on my forehead. I never tasted the tomato sauce.\
  \ But I bet it was sweet."
