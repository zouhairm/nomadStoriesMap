Text: "Cara\u2019s cries pierced the hollow desert canyon below as she careened down\
  \ the rock face, landing with a crack as the rope caught her and slammed her back\
  \ into the wall. \nAmidst shrieks of pain, she looked down at me from her perch\
  \ and shouted that she thought she had broken her ankle. Panic exuded her every\
  \ pore.\nA thousand feet up in the air, anxiety coursed through my veins even as\
  \ I tried my best to maintain a calm demeanor and assess our escape options. \n\
  I wanted my baby cousin to know that she was going to be okay. But doubt kept creeping\
  \ into my consciousness: what if I couldn\u2019t get us down safely? \nEarlier that\
  \ day, Cara and I had decided to climb a thousand-foot ascent to a palm-tree lined\
  \ summit along a classic route in Mexico\u2019s world-renowned El Potrero Chico.\
  \ Now I was questioning our selection of such an ambitious climb on her first trip.\n\
  Trying to silence my inner critic, I took a deep breath and lowered my cousin on\
  \ to the small limestone ledge where I stood belaying her. \nI felt my gut wrench\
  \ as I delivered news I knew she wouldn\u2019t want to hear. The quickest and safest\
  \ way down was up, I explained. We had to finish the last climb of the day and reach\
  \ the summit of the mountain so that we could safely rappel down.\nMy heart sunk\
  \ as she pleadingly repeated, \u201CI can\u2019t do it, Wes, I can\u2019t.\u201D\
  \ \nA few minutes later, acknowledging the challenging reality of our situation,\
  \ she reluctantly agreed to give it a shot. As the rays of sun began to vanish,\
  \ I quickly climbed the final route, eager to get off the mountain before darkness\
  \ set in. \nThen, securing her from up above, I watched with a mixture of compassion\
  \ and awe as Cara agonizingly clawed her way up the same route that had felled her\
  \ twenty minutes prior. Her screams more reminiscent of a tennis star in the throes\
  \ of a championship match than a climber at the crag, I rejoiced when we reached\
  \ the peak and Cara lit up with a smile as she marveled in the magnificence of the\
  \ craggy peaks surrounding us.\nLater that evening, once back on solid ground, we\
  \ congregated with friends over tacos and beer, regaling each other with stories\
  \ of our day. As I recounted the theatrics of our day, I noticed the doubt I felt\
  \ earlier give way to an immense wave of gratitude. Gratitude for the lessons we\
  \ learned in the face of adversity, and also for the renewed vigor I felt toward\
  \ perfecting my climbing craft. \nApparently Cara agreed. Two days later back in\
  \ the U.S., I get a text. \u201CCara: Climbing in New Mexico this weekend. Wanna\
  \ join?\""
