Text: "The wind is full of surprises. Wind doesn\u2019t care where you came from or\
  \ where you\u2019re going, it just wants to live in the moment. Much of one\u2019\
  s experience in and around the wine country east of Cape Town, South Africa can\
  \ feel like the wind. The people, the music, the food \u2013 they grab your attention\
  \ and push and pull you in directions you wouldn\u2019t expect. For me, a great\
  \ place to start a holiday is with the tongue and the belly, so I decided to load\
  \ up my bicycle and drive into the heart of the Stellenbosch wine country. I don\u2019\
  t know wine, but my legs, my stomach, and my palate were ready. Hidden Valley, Waterford,\
  \ and Stark-Cond\xE9 filled day one. Day two began at Thelema Mountain, a family-owned\
  \ estate atop a lovely hill with stunning valley views. I\u2019m a sucker for a\
  \ good story and Thelema\u2019s location is paired with a history and a land they\
  \ are proud of \u2013 lovingly restored from a sad, forgotten and dilapidated fruit\
  \ farm. Two friends, Adam and Sun\xE9, walked me through rows of green vines, uncovering\
  \ the estate\u2019s history and providing precious insight. \u201COur altitude and\
  \ this red clay at our feet, this is what helps us. Without this clay we\u2019d\
  \ be nothing,\u201D Sun\xE9 said. \u201CThe wind doesn\u2019t hurt, either!\u201D\
  \ Adam chimed. I was fully engrossed in stories of wine production and local grape\
  \ selections, \u201CSouth African\u201D wine character, and how \u201Cminimal interference\u201D\
  \ was more than winemaking policy. \u201CWe should do our jobs, be inspired, share\
  \ inspiration and leave the grapes alone!\u201D I listened intently, but we were\
  \ interrupted by a howling gust of wind blowing Sun\xE9\u2019s hat three rows over.\
  \ They laughed, \u201CThat wind.\u201D These chilling, rapid-fire gusts were the\
  \ only interference allowed here. A harmony exists between the wind and the wine;\
  \ the grapes hold on even when whipped around. I imagine their strength and hardiness\
  \ translates directly into their bold characters. I am blamed for being a romantic\
  \ and told I would fit in well there. Adam jokingly offers me a job. Sun\xE9\u2019\
  s eyes twinkle a bit. I change the subject and entice them to join me on the terrace\
  \ for a glass. I fell in love with Thelema, its views, its grandfather-like oak\
  \ trees, the green summer vines, the colour-changing mountains of nearby Simonsberg,\
  \ the lazy peacocks, and the gale-force winds inspired me. I felt a resurgence of\
  \ old creativity and a longing to stay for years and learn how to create something\
  \ just as special as Thelema had -- with a little soil and a little hope and a strong\
  \ southerly wind. So I did."
