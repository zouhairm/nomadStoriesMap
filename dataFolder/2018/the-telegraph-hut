Text: "The southern alps were pale with distance and snow-capped. Like a spine, they\
  \ lay along the entire horizon until the earth fell away. The road I had walked\
  \ cut straight towards them as far as the eye could see through fields of dirt and\
  \ dead grass, undulating and empty.\nI was alone, and had arrived at the Telegraph\
  \ Hut, where I would be spending the night. \nIt was the tiniest little thing. Inside\
  \ there was nothing but a set of thin bunk beds, sturdily built out of the same\
  \ wood as the rest of the hut, a stone fireplace, and some fresh milk and granulated\
  \ coffee.\nBy the time night fell, It was so cold that anywhere outside of my fire\u2019\
  s small radius of heat was unbearable. I swathed myself in all the clothes I had\
  \ and, as I waited for my water to heat on my gas stove for dinner, began pacing\
  \ the room, now washed in the flickering glow of a fire. \nWhere had the coffee\
  \ and milk sitting on the shelf come from? It was fresh, so they can\u2019t have\
  \ been here long ago, and yet this hut was days away from the nearest sign of civilisation.\
  \ I was an eighteen year old girl and halfway through a 100km in midwinter where\
  \ I had expected to see no one. I was afraid.\nAnd that\u2019s when the first grenade\
  \ went off.\nI screamed aloud, at both the first and the second, but at the third\
  \ I rushed to the door to watch through the crack in the door. Hopeless - it was\
  \ pitch black out there.\nThen a fourth. By this point I was shaking.\nAfter the\
  \ fourth there was nothing but the crackle and spit of the fire for quite some time,\
  \ and the sound of blood roaring in my ears. I was hardly breathing. If I had to\
  \ run, I was ready. A few moments later I heard footsteps. And they were coming\
  \ towards my hut. \nKnuckles rapped on the old wooden door. \u201CHello,\u201D called\
  \ a man\u2019s voice.\n\u201CHi\u2026\u201D\n\u201CHiya, sorry to disturb.\u201D\
  \ \nI opened the door to reveal a young soldier. He stood at a respectable distance,\
  \ one hand in his pocket, another resignedly waving a cigarette to and from his\
  \ mouth. \u201CJust thought I\u2019d come apologise for the racket.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Oh, no problem,\u201D I lied. \u201CWhat was going on?\u201D\n\u201CThis is a military\
  \ exercise area?\u201D\n\u201COh!\u201D I gasped, \u201CI didn\u2019t realise that!\u201D\
  \n\u201CSorry miss.\u201D He looked down at his boots, stubbed out his cigarette.\
  \ \u201CWell now you now. Should also let ya know that we\u2019ll be coming back\
  \ at dawn. If it makes it better we\u2019ll be cooking up a mean breakfast. You\
  \ can have some too. Bacon and eggs, s\u2019that alright?\u201D\n\u201CThat sounds\u2026\
  \ fine to me,\u201D I stammered.\n\u201CGreat. And that milk and coffee was ours\
  \ too. Help yourself.\u201D"
