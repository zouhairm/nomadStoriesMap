Text: "I glanced at a few pictures of the property we were going to and was quite\
  \ content with the homestay I'd booked. Before we actually set out on the trip,\
  \ I received a ton of calls from the owner of the homestay wanting to talk to me.\
  \ He kept insisting that we should connect over the phone to discuss the stay and\
  \ I wasn't comfortable with the idea. So I shared his number with a male friend\
  \ and asked him to contact the owner, because he came across as quite a creepy man\
  \ to me. \n The day arrived, we stepped out of the Bagdogra Airport, jumped into\
  \ a local cab and headed over to our homestay in Darjeeling. A million thoughts\
  \ crossed my mind as we drove past the forest roads while witnessing the explosion\
  \ of colours at sundown. Little did I know that my experience had already begun,\
  \ starting from the day I began planning this trip to the untouched land of North\
  \ East of India. \n While in the cab, all excited to begin my trip, somewhere I\
  \ was a little skeptical about that man. It was pitch dark when we reached his property\
  \ and there he came, a young good looking man, with the brightest and warmest smile\
  \ and greeted us all. He put a Tibetan Khata, a silk scarf around our necks as he\
  \ welcomed us.  Sangam was his name, which means confluence of rivers in Hindi.\
  \ I walked up to him and introduced myself. And he exlclaimed, \"Oh Rachael, that's\
  \ you. It's so good to finally meet you.\" He was the perfect host, and I shed all\
  \ my judgemental notions about him at that very moment. I felt a sense of relief\
  \ and happiness to have actually met him. My friends teased, \"Ab karna uske saat\
  \ Sangam!\" (Literally in English: Go merge with him) Later that night he arranged\
  \ some tasteful local beers for us. We sat around a bonfire and spoke about our\
  \ families and our lives. His father, a retired army man, a former pilot and a police\
  \ officer now, shared with us stories of their ancestors, their home and the stunning\
  \ picturesque view we'd see at sunrise. \n I thought about it all night, how I was\
  \ quick to judge a person I never met. We were to leave the place the next morning\
  \ as our destination was Sikkim, and this place was only a stopover. But honestly\
  \ we all wished we could just stay there and extend our trip. Sangam's warm personality\
  \ and friendly gestures won our hearts and till date I'm in touch with him. Sometimes\
  \ you find people and befriend them unknowingly. This cute local friend I made,\
  \ was a lesson for me, to open my heart and to experience love (platonic here) in\
  \ all its forms."
