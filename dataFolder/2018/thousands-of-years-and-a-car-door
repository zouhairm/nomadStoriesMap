Text: "The car starts to wobble, and my attention is torn away from the lush rainforest\
  \ around me. \"What is it?\" I ask. \"A flat tire, sir\", the cab driver says, pulling\
  \ over. The convoy of vehicles that we were a part of continue, past us. \n\n\"\
  What? You can fix it, right?\" I ask, recollecting all the warning signs at the\
  \ check-post we had seen just a while ago.  \"DO drive a vehicle carefully & only\
  \ in a convoy. DON'T stop the vehicle in the Jarawa Area\", they said.\n\nWe were\
  \ driving through a stretch of the Andamans reserved for the Jarawa, a tribe whose\
  \ origins can be traced back to the first Homo Sapiens that settled Asia, over 30,000\
  \ years ago. Only a few hundred in number, they remain untouched by colonisation,\
  \ through the centuries, fiercely protecting their isolation.\n\nI start to get\
  \ a little nervous. The army officer was clear; \"The Jarawa are not to be spoken\
  \ to, or even looked at. They only use bows and arrows but kill outsiders. They're\
  \ okay only with the army translators peppered around the reserve; no one else.\"\
  \n\n\"Why'd you stop?\" I hear a voice behind me. A man walks up wearing jungle\
  \ fatigues. \"You've got to leave now!\" \n\nI tell him about the flat tire; he\
  \ looks around nervously. \n\n\"Okay, tell madam to stay in the car\", he says,\
  \ pointing to my wife \"And for God's sake, don't let anything shiny reflect sunlight.\
  \ They wouldn't know what to do with them, but they'll take them all the same.\"\
  \ \n\nAll of a sudden, he turns around and yells something in a strange language.\
  \ \n\n\"Who are you talking to?\" I ask, peering into the jungle. And out of nowhere,\
  \ three men materialise, no taller than young boys, no more than 50 feet away. I\
  \ realise I had been looking straight at them, without actually seeing them. \"\
  They've been there since you stopped. I'll help but we have to be quick!\" \n\n\
  As we change tires, I keep glancing nervously in their direction. They stand there\
  \ like obsidian statues, staring at us, holding crude bows and arrows. \n\n\"Go\
  \ now!\" The translator says. And as we pull away, we look back and the Jarawa men\
  \ haven't moved. I start to notice more faces as we speed up, looking at us through\
  \ the wall of green. Men, women, children; all naked and unafraid, looking at us\
  \ curiously. They looked like people out of time; unchanged in this pocket of the\
  \ world that was theirs.\n\nWe were the aliens, the intruders in their land that\
  \ time forgot. Thousands of years and a car door separates us."
