Text: "We started our trip at the break of dawn to the northeastern Indian province\
  \ of Meghalaya. It was a planned one day trip, with my office colleagues, to two\
  \ popular hill stations of Meghalaya \u2013 Shillong and Cherrapunji.\nSoon the\
  \ bus started for our first destination, Shillong, also known as the Scotland of\
  \ East India. We were all awestruck and amazed to see the oneiric sunrise. The sanguine\
  \ sun started peeking from in between the mountain valleys, which was as enchanting\
  \ as an amazing artwork. I could not stop myself from clicking pictures all the\
  \ way long as we were passing through scenic Ghats. During our sojurns at various\
  \ view-points, I was captivated by the serenity of the verdant meadows. We visited\
  \ many magical waterfalls and lakes including Elephant falls and gorgeous Umiam\
  \ lake. And ofcourse, the natural formations by stalactites and stalagmites at Mawsmai\
  \ Caves left us all in a state of awe. \nAs we continued, I kept watching outside\
  \ the window of the bus. I could feel the pristine air on my face and it was permeating\
  \ my body, helping me to heal this haggard body and mind of mine due to the exhausting\
  \ city life and busy routine. We were passing through picturesque villages surrounded\
  \ by undulating hills and villagers carrying water in their carrying poles and climbing\
  \ small steps leading to the chalets situated at some heights in the mountains.\
  \ I was lost in my own thoughts of comparing the lives of the people living in such\
  \ remote mountainous regions with limited luxury and facilities but in the lap of\
  \ the Mother Nature and the people living ostentatiously in big crowded cities.\
  \ \nSuddenly our bus stopped. As I was stepping down from the bus I heard some faded\
  \ screams coming from the mountain trench. I moved forward to unveil the source\
  \ of those screams and voila! It was Zip Lining. It was the last thing I was expecting-\
  \ a fun adventurous activity on this trip but here it was, in front me, my chance\
  \ to try the first adventure sport of my life. I was full of vim and vigour. I got\
  \ all geared up and signed the pre-requisites to enjoy this sport. However, as I\
  \ reached to the edge of the cliff, the vertiginous height gave me chills and slackened\
  \ my zest. But to avoid any compunction I mustered up all my strength and gave it\
  \ a shot. I was howling and shouting happily as I wafted to the other end. \nAll\
  \ in all it was trip that filled me with various emotions, gave me lots of experiences\
  \ and became an unforgettable trip that I will cherish all my life."
