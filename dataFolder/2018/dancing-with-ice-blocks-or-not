Text: "USA: the land of dreams, the land of mesmerizing sceneries, bright cities,\
  \ astounding parks and relaxing beaches. Many people were gained by her and I admit\
  \ to be a piece of this dreaming-America delicious cake. \nOn the whole everyone\
  \ thinks about metropolitan citizens as ice blocks, zombies, fast trains, a liar\
  \ and unfeeling world of men in suits. \nI have never believed in sterotypes and,\
  \ indeed, since my first step in the American land I have seen fire in those ice\
  \ blocks.\nI have been to Boston (MA) during the summer - if you are wondering so,\
  \ the warmth I felt wasn\u2019t due to the hot sun- I wanted to step into an American\u2019\
  s shoes. \nMetropolis are often thought to be empty during summer holidays, if this\
  \ had been true, my plan would have failed. But, hey!, can the Hub- as she is called-\
  \ stop? Never! \nWhen the students of her famous universities don\u2019t crowd them,\
  \ tourists, guides replace them. However, the night gives universities a beating\
  \ of their own life. And so, the Science\u2019s temple, the great MIT, becomes home\
  \ for Lindy Hop dancers- if someone of you don\u2019t know what it is (like me before\
  \ I went there), it\u2019s an afro-american dance.\nHow can a girl dance L.Hop without\
  \ even having heard about it before? Well, she lets the music take her. Oh, well,\
  \ right\u2026what about her partner? She doesn\u2019t need it, every woman can dance\
  \ with everyone- females or males, no discrimination, just a flowing dancing body.\n\
  Now let\u2019s go to that Wednesday when I dove into this spirit. Getting off from\
  \ the bus, a short walk and..here it is, the Gehry MIT Building, an intricated and\
  \ intriguing building that seems to be destinated to his almost secret second-life.\
  \ Serious, clever in the morning; bold and dynamic during the night. When I entered\
  \ the air was full of energy and music. The class-ballroom was a little bit further,\
  \ but finally I saw it and\u2026WOW!\nDancers: dancers with large skirts, dancers\
  \ tourning around the room, dancers everywhere! So let\u2019s go dance! \nA boy\
  \ may take you trying to teach you how to dance- or maybe you are better than me-\
  \ and you will often change partner ( probably with a fast lesson from each one\
  \ of them). No matter if you aren\u2019t able to dance, no shame or shyness, you\u2019\
  ll regret it! Dance until you are tired and sweaty (not too much\u2026you won\u2019\
  t catch a partner again!), meet new people, talk through the dance, the most universal\
  \ and easiest language of all time. And when you feel the explosive will to dance,\
  \ you are really putting yourself in a local\u2019s shoes."
