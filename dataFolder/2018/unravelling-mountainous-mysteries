Text: "\u2018You want ganja?\u2019 was the first question I was asked two weeks earlier\
  \ by a group of young men milling around in the bright sunshine beside Lake Pokhara.\
  \ \u2018Did you hear about the accident?\u2019 was their second question. An avalanche\
  \ during a big storm close to Thorung La Pass, the after effects of a cyclone that\
  \ had passed over the East Coast of India and translated into heavy snowfalls high\
  \ up in the mountains of central Nepal.\nUnsure of how far to proceed, I decided\
  \ to begin the trek and assess the situation as I went. The local economy relies\
  \ heavily on the tourist dollars that arrive during the short trekking season and\
  \ an accident of this magnitude would adversely affect numbers on the Annnapurna\
  \ circuit.\nPrecarious rope bridges decorated with prayer flags traversed me above\
  \ the creamy blue Marshyandi river, at first through lush subtropical forests and\
  \ then ever higher up into the rarefied atmosphere where vegetation and oxygen both\
  \ become a thin commodity.\nAt night I would sit eating Dal Bhat with my benevolent\
  \ hosts, toasting my feet by the clay furnace, beneath hanging bunches of fragrant\
  \ herbs and coils of cured meat. I stopped at Buddhist monasteries to chat about\
  \ the Impermanence of life and atop every hill, stupas in varying degrees of decay\
  \ stood with the painted eyes of a deity contemplating the valley below.\nI observed\
  \ the locals either habitually or superstitiously turn every prayer wheel they passed\
  \ and I adopted the custom, running my palm across the raised ribs of Sanskrit letters\
  \ at every opportunity.\nSome of the peaks on the edge of the Tibetan Plateau are\
  \ considered so sacred they have never been summited while others have claimed many\
  \ lives in man\u2019s pursuit to test himself in one of this planets most spectacular\
  \ and unforgiving domains.\nSo now here I am on my knees in the snow with head resting\
  \ against my makeshift walking stick, vaguely aware that I have all the symptoms\
  \ of acute mountain sickness. The only remedy for my condition is to descend to\
  \ a lower altitude, either back the way I came or to press on to the pass and down\
  \ the other side. Up ahead an eagle glides down in slow motion behind the roof of\
  \ the teahouse that signifies the physical and emotional climax of my journey. My\
  \ attempt at crossing the highest point of the trek has surreptitiously arrived\
  \ and if the Mountain gods are going to be kind enough to bless me with good weather,\
  \ then I have an ethereal compulsion to seize the chance."
