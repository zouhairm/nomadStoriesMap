Text: "My plane is due to land in Juneau just after 12 pm. I stare thoughtlessly out\
  \ of the window at a scene I thought only existed in National Geographic documentaries.\n\
  \nI recount the small fold of money I have left for the hundredth time. I had lost\
  \ my wallet in Minneapolis but couldn't afford to miss my flight, so had to accept\
  \ the fact that I made a bad-guy richer or a good-guy feel righteous. \n\nThe layover\
  \ in Juneau is three and a half hours. I know Mendenhall Glacier is only a 15-minute\
  \ drive from the airport, so inquire at the information desk. A 30-something-year-old\
  \ woman appears grateful for conversation. She says a taxi would take me to the\
  \ glacier and back for around $30. I look at my small wad of cash and sigh. We chat\
  \ a little more and I tell her about my wallet. She is full of empathy but advises\
  \ me not to let it ruin my trip. Once in a lifetime, she says.\n\nA mother and son\
  \ are sitting in the waiting lounge. I see from their body language that they are\
  \ close.\n\n\"He always talked about coming to Alaska, and I had to give in at some\
  \ point!\" \n\nThe boy smiles nervously but appears to enjoy our conversation. I\
  \ ask them if they want to share a taxi to the glacier.\n \n\"Apparently there are\
  \ a ton of bears up there...\" I lie to the boy, with a wide-eyed smile. We both\
  \ look to his Mother for an answer.\n\n\"That's kind of you but I think we'll wait\
  \ until we can put our bags down.\"\nI don't tell them that I can't afford the taxi\
  \ but thank them anyway. I wander down nearby roads; the mountains leering at me.\n\
  \nI am back in time for boarding. More people have landed, and I notice an aura\
  \ of arrogance. Only a handful of people fly into Gustavus every day, and I get\
  \ the impression each person feels more deserving than the next. \n\nThe plane is\
  \ only half full, so I take a window seat in quiet satisfaction.\n\nI step off the\
  \ plane and flinch away from the glare of the sun and the crispness of the air.\
  \ On the runway, I am approached by the mother. She says they heard I had lost my\
  \ wallet. Her son stands nervously behind her. She holds out her hand and offers\
  \ me $20. I touch her shoulder and thank her deeply. I am embarrassed by her kindness\
  \ and politely decline. I explain I am meeting a friend here. She insists that I\
  \ accept the money. In her eyes, I see a look sincerity that I wish I had shown\
  \ in mine when we spoke in Juneau. I take the money and hold her in the embrace\
  \ of a long-lost friend.\n\nI remember the look in her eyes more vividly than any\
  \ Alaskan landscape."
