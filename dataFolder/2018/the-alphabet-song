Text: "Buried deep within the pungent streets of a traditional Congalese fishing village,\
  \ I am sitting at the back of a classroom. Classroom in this sense comprises a small\
  \ square room with a dirt floor, wooden planks haphazardly nailed into desks and\
  \ chairs and a blackboard leaning drunkenly against the wall. Twenty students are\
  \ tightly packed into the dimly lit space. We are in the process of learning the\
  \ alphabet.\n\nTHOCK- the metal ruler slams into the blackboard next to the first\
  \ letter. \n\n\"Louder!\" \n\"a.\" \n\n\"Louder!\" \n\"A.\" \n\n\"LOUDER!\" \n\"\
  AYE!\" \n\nTHOCK \n\n\"BEE!\"\n\nTHOCK\n\n\"DEE!\"\n\n\"D DOES NOT PRECEDE C. AGAIN.\"\
  \n\nTHOCK\n\nSweat trickles down the teacher's creased forehead as he smashes his\
  \ way from A to Z in the humid classroom. I can feel the seconds ticking over on\
  \ my wristwatch as flies buzz lazily overhead. After an hour of this torturous performance,\
  \ a welcome distraction appears in the form of my guide Mama Stephanie. She suggests\
  \ that I teach the class the English alphabet.\n\nFor the first time that morning\
  \ every student's gaze is fixed on the front of the classroom, waiting to hear this\
  \ strange person speak. Unsure of my reception, I clear my throat and start somewhat\
  \ hesitatingly, \"A.\"\n\nThe class replies with gusto, \"Ayyyyyyyyyye.\"\n\nLaughing\
  \ now, \"B.\"\n\n\"Beeeeeeeeeeeeeeee.\"\n\nAll the way through to W where I have\
  \ a mental blank, \"Double...\"\n\nThe class cheerfully repeats, \"Dooooouble.\"\
  \n\nFinally, because I am having as much difficulty as they are, I turn to my friend,\
  \ \"Mama Stephanie, we have a song to help us remember the alphabet in Australia.\"\
  \n\n\"Go on Louisa. You will teach us this song.\"\n\nWith twenty pairs of brown\
  \ eyes following my every move, I dutifully warble my way through the alphabet.\
  \ Somewhat flatteringly, I can see little fingers tapping in time with the beat.\
  \ When it comes to their turn, however, the children still struggle to string the\
  \ letters together. \n\nFrustrated, I grab a piece of chalk and write the following\
  \ on the board:\n\nA B C D E F G \nH I J K \nL M N O P\nQ R S\nT U V\nW\nX\nY\n\
  Z \n\nThis time with the song separated into verses, it is much more successful.\
  \ Evolving, the tune soon loses its traditional sound and becomes more tribal, pointed.\
  \ The kids are clapping and some are beginning to sway to the new beat. The last\
  \ four lines are yelled, fists pumping the air, feet stomping the ground, eyes flashing\
  \ excitedly. W! X! Y! AND Z! They repeat it several times over for good measure."
