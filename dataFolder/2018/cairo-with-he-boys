Text: "This is a story of how flying to Cairo to meet a man ended up being one of\
  \ the best memories from my travels.\n\nWhen the plane landed in Cairo Diana was\
  \ fidgeting, like a kid who can't wait to run free. I could only think of the hundreds\
  \ of years in history I was about to discover, finally the places from tales of\
  \ pharaohs and gods that I had only seen through my history books and documentaries\
  \ were closer to me.\n\nAfter what seemed more than two hours, the driver finally\
  \ parked the cab outside our hotel. We had gone through highways and narrow streets,\
  \ where one can barely see traffic lights, and the cars and people make a chaos;\
  \ but all of that was gone once we could finally get some food and enjoy the view\
  \ of the pyramids from our hotel room.\n\nDiana was nervous walking from side to\
  \ side of the room, until I sent her to go check at the reception, he might arrive\
  \ soon, and if he didn't I would look for him, find him, and...bring him to the\
  \ hotel. She had waited to meet 'Memo' for 15 years! and I, the one who had been\
  \ her friend longer than that, didn't know about their story until she had to confess\
  \ and explain why she wanted to fly to Cairo instead of spending more time enjoying\
  \ Istanbul. This trip was about hope, illusion and adventure, unforgettable I thought.\n\
  \nMohamed was a cheerful and kind Egyptian man, he was nervous, maybe more than\
  \ Diana. The next day after our tour to the pyramids and the Egyptian Museum where\
  \ I had my share of joy, Mohamed and his friend picked us up from the hotel. We\
  \ went to a restaurant where we enjoyed local food, followed by a fun couple hours\
  \ at the bowling, where I proved to have a natural talent ;-)\n\nSuddenly Diana\
  \ was crying, she confessed she was waiting more from him, more than just as a friend.\
  \ 'Here the culture is different, here you don't see couples holding hands or kissing\
  \ openly in the streets, far from what we are used in South America' I said to her,\
  \ and the tears stopped.\n\nThe night ended in Feshawy, the oldest caf\xE9 in Cairo\
  \ as the boys said. But it was time to go back to the hotel, for we had an early\
  \ flight back to Istanbul the next day. I said goodbye, thanked our hosts for the\
  \ special night and went to sleep, a few minutes later Diana came crying again,\
  \ this time her tears were of joy, she had a long kiss goodbye, like in the movies\
  \ she said, one of those kisses that make you forget time and place, and everyone\
  \ else (the hotel staff) remains motionless, until the magic breaks. Until next\
  \ time Egypt!"
