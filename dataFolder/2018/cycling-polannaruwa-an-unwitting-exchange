Text: "Exhilaration and adrenaline mix delightfully as I nudge my push-bike up the\
  \ gently sloping road. \n\nA bike ride unlike any other; we\u2019re in Sri Lanka,\
  \ and the hum of excitement inside me combines with endlessly beeping horns, bhangra\
  \ blaring from buses executing overtakes with aplomb, and the barking of dogs who\
  \ rouse themselves from sleep to chase after four British girls on bikes, eliciting\
  \ amused yet fearful shouts of \u2018PEDAL!\u2019 from Sarah, who brings up the\
  \ rear. \n\nI feel altogether calmer once in the cobbled sanctuary of the Polannaruwa\
  \ ruins complex. The pre-modern Sinhalese ruins, resplendent in warm stone hues,\
  \ evoke a sense of timelessness as the jungle grows around them and visitors patter\
  \ by respectfully with modern-day gadgets. I\u2019m kept in the present by the hot\
  \ grit between my toes \u2013 shoes aren\u2019t permitted \u2013 and the smiles\
  \ and sun cream bottle I share with my companions. \n\nLater, turning off from the\
  \ main paths, we freewheel along a brilliantly orange dirt track through the jungle.\
  \ I imagine creatures peeking through the foliage. We stop to capture the satisfyingly\
  \ smooth lines of a well-preserved Lotus Pond on four smartphone cameras, then set\
  \ off again \u2013 uphill now, and wobbly around the potholes. I\u2019m grateful\
  \ as I hear a moped behind slow to overtake cautiously, and it takes a moment to\
  \ register what\u2019s happened when my rucksack is hoisted from my bike basket\
  \ and three men, grinning widely, gather speed and top the crest of the hill. \n\
  \nResignation sets in fast, though the sense of shock and vulnerability linger as\
  \ we somberly pedal to the guards at the ruins\u2019 gates. \n\nI have to smile\
  \ as my friends earnestly charade the theft for the guards, and when the police\
  \ officers who later arrive invite the four of us into their car\u2019s rear three\
  \ seats. Wide-eyed, we survey charts of livestock theft and typewriter-laden desks\
  \ at the police station. Already it dawns on us that this is a travel experience\
  \ of a unique order, and I\u2019m not too sad if I\u2019ve unwittingly traded a\
  \ camera and iPod (carrying songs chosen in poor taste during my teenage years)\
  \ for our \u2018ticket\u2019 to this.\n\nThe dismay of Pubu, the paternal owner\
  \ of our hostel, and the sympathetic shoulder-tousle he gives me that night are\
  \ the humanity-affirming gestures I need. I\u2019m quietly pleased that the shock\
  \ mugging of that morning will keep my eyes more open to the diversity of people,\
  \ and our interconnectedness, as our Sri Lankan journey continues. Polannaruwa remains\
  \ a favourite anecdote of the trip."
