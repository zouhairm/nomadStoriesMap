Text: "It was a local trip To our relatives place which is some 4-5kms away from my\
  \ place.\nA good sunny atmosphere made me expect it to be a pretty good day.\nOur\
  \ mode of travelling was public transports. Publuc auto rickshaws packed by peoples,\
  \ still auto driver adjusted sit for me and my mom. One can learn adjustment by\
  \ them. The amazing thing one can experience in an auto rickshaw is looking out,\
  \ the other vehicles, shops, roads, markets, with co passenger talking in background.\
  \ Those co passengers always gets into some talks like politics, daily travelling,\
  \ inflation, or drivers taking extra fare or sometimes a general talk.\nAnd this\
  \ was all I was experiencing.\nAfter not so tiring journey we reached there house.\
  \ They were getting ready to go to a local science centre and gardenit was none\
  \ other than The Raman Science Centre and Raman Planetarium Complex at Nagpur. It\
  \ is an interactive science centre affiliated with Mumbai's Nehru Science Centre.The\
  \ centre was developed to promote a scientific attitude, portray the growth of science\
  \ and technology and their applications in industry and human welfare, and hold\
  \ science exhibits. The centre is named after famous Nobel Prize winner Indian physicist\
  \ Chandrasekhara Venkata Rama.\nWith a small nano car we reached with them. Guards\
  \ there in gate where strict but  helpful in guiding people. We bought tickets to\
  \ enter the place. Beautiful bushes and flowers welcomed us. Moving further animals\
  \ were in cage.. This made me sad.\nBut there were a variety of animals, must say\
  \ that it was a good collection. Then we saw a kids corner, ladders, swings kids\
  \ enjoyed well. There were small hut like roof with a stone table and bench for\
  \ friends and families to have food with such a beautiful view and tasty street\
  \ snacks. There were so many scientific plus historic instruments and things which\
  \ not only amused people but also inspired them.  There was a Planeterium too but\
  \ unfortunately it was housefull. \nIt is a place with cheap rate tickets and easy\
  \ to reach. It is a place full of knowledge and nature. \nThis is how I and mom\
  \ enjoyed an unexpected local trip to that centre.\nA must visited place."
