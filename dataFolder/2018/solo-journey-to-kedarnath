Text: "How do I step out? What if I do? What if I don\u2019t? This dilemma is killing\
  \ and I can\u2019t afford to spend a lot of time thinking about it or she\u2019\
  ll know. One thing I\u2019m sure of is I can\u2019t not-go so I start answering\
  \ myself one by one. If I don\u2019t, I\u2019ll never know what it\u2019s like,\
  \ and this isn\u2019t the time to have cold feet. To top it, I can't add it to my\
  \ list of regrets.\nIf I do, I may or may not regret it but I\u2019ll have a new\
  \ life experience in my kitty and I always wanted to do it so why not when I\u2019\
  ve got the chance; irrespective of the fact that I\u2019m not prepared for the blow.\
  \ In that light, I\u2019ll never be.\nHow? Is the most difficult one that I fail\
  \ to translate in words. All I can tell myself is, \u2018JUST DO IT\u2019 (no, I'm\
  \ not a Nike fan).\nI\u2019m going on a pilgrim that had devastating floods 4 years\
  \ ago and my family was skeptical already. Despite my constant efforts at building\
  \ their confidence that everything\u2019s ok now, the unpredictability of the Himalayas\
  \ keeps winning at maintaining their fear. It took me courage to overcome the same\
  \ fear and then the realization that I\u2019ll be alone just added to my anxiety.\n\
  Without telling my Mom that my friends ditched me last minute I decide to take this\
  \ one alone. Coming from a traditional Indian family, going on a trip for a girl\
  \ is forbidden before marriage, let alone a solo one.\nBeing the youngest of 4,\
  \ I happen to be the most pampered with some liberties; at the same time, I have\
  \ to carry the baggage of being responsible for my parents and myself so my \u2018\
  liberties\u2019 aren\u2019t questioned. While lying to her that my friends will\
  \ meet me at the bus station, I avoid a stable eye contact with her. Mother being\
  \ mother smells when their kids are up to something. I quickly stuff my bag and\
  \ leave 2 hours early for the bus station which is 20mins away for me. Hurriedly,\
  \ I leave and speak to her on my way while she tries to talk me back home accurately\
  \ suspecting that I\u2019m alone but I try to pacify her and maintain the same story\
  \ of \u2018waiting friends'.\nFrom buying a single ticket to being seen alone through\
  \ the journey to eating alone and trekking to the temple alone, I see many raised\
  \ eyebrows on my way because they\u2019d expect a \u2018hippie-looking\u2019 foreigner\
  \ girl to travel alone but not a \u2018simple-looking\u2019 Indian girl. Many a\
  \ times I lie to a few people that my friends are ahead of me to avoid any trouble.\
  \ Continuing the same story, I spend the night with one eye open & step out at the\
  \ crack of the dawn for another day of confident nervous travel\u2026"
