Text: "It is a very personal story,but this decision taught me so much about myself\
  \ and form my attitude towards the world.2,5 years ago I met my boyfriend while\
  \ he was traveling in Hungary. It was an undeniably love at first sight. traveling\
  \ determined this relationship from the very beginning. Oh those 6 AM flights to\
  \ Tel Aviv, or how many times I rushed from the airport directly to the office with\
  \ sand in my shoes. But one year later we wanted more. On day he called me a big\
  \ smile on his face that he got a dream job in Amsterdam....and I started crying.\
  \ But those were not the tears of joy but sadness. He got a job in the city I dislike\
  \ the most in the entire planet. But we already agreed to move and I quit my job.\
  \ But I knew me moving to that city will push me to the edge.\nIn the begining I\
  \ was so eager to find a job. I called everyone and applied for everything. I was\
  \ full of hope,energy and curiosity. I set my mind and decided to focus only on\
  \ the positive and the good and put aside my negative impressions. Hey...I was with\
  \ the love of my life, what could go possibly wrong? I had zero doubts that I can\
  \ manage to get a decent job and find friends with whome I can enjoy whatever the\
  \ city can offer. As time passed, we went several years \"sunshine trips\" to Spain,\
  \ Italy and Portugal- just to enjoy life. But I could not manage what I wanted and\
  \ started to lose hope. But stayed strong and got new hobbies, yoga, more painting\
  \ and drawing. I mastered new skills of cooking. I tried several meetup groups and\
  \ Facebook groups to feel that I am understood and belong. In Budapest I have amazing\
  \ friends and the city offers plenty of creative activities even if you don't have\
  \ money. Amsterdam does not...\nNo matter how hard I tried I felt that I failed\
  \ and I was alone. Then I got a job that made everything even worse. In the same\
  \ year I had an abortion as well, because we planned a round a world trip for a\
  \ year. \nThat was the moment when I felt that I lost everything and I should give\
  \ up. At the same time his career has been boosted more than ever."
