Text: "It was more of a tournament than a trip. Well, just turned the other way.Gwalior\
  \ fort is an archaeological site that was to be visited.In the evening we reached\
  \ there and moving further all got busy capturing photographs, time passed and yet\
  \ not booked the tickets for visit! Later, only few were willing to explore, also\
  \ the guide charged Rs.800 for an hour. It was getting dark and our guardian instructed\
  \ to cancel the plan, as most of us were unwilling for it.At this point my nerves\
  \ were filled with anguish and despair, my excitement dropped.Next day, I decided\
  \ that even though we had to catch the train in noon I\u2019ll explore it till its\
  \ depth, and I managed to get the permission(which I got it after many requests)\
  \ and rushed. But this time, I managed to hire a guide who just charged Rs.200 which\
  \ kept me in doubt about his authenticity as he charged less than yesterday, but\
  \ still took a chance. \nEntering in, was like entering a maze, without the guide\
  \ I would have surely lost inside. It was divided into several sections that seemed\
  \ identical except the carvings, as the carvings of a particular section were peculiar\
  \ and unique, resembled to the activities performed like, in temple room the carvings\
  \ of lotus and bells created a suitable decorum for the prayers and meditation.\
  \ Also in evenings when the lamps were lit, it created beautiful ambiance as the\
  \ light reflected from the mirrors gave an impression like designs in a kaleidoscope,\
  \ as different pieces gave beautiful designs similarly different flashing lights\
  \ formed beautiful designs due to reflection. Entirely, the fort was just a charming\
  \ beauty consisting of blue enamel work resembling 'Tomar' dynasty.\nAfter my exploration\
  \ I thanked the guide for an avid explanation of all the details of the fort and\
  \ while paying I asked that why did he charged less then others and he replied that\
  \ very few people are interested in knowing ancient sites and if people will charge\
  \ more just for the guidance than no one will keep interest in knowing and there\u2019\
  ll be diminishing response from the people to acquire details about history, so\
  \ by charging less I maintain the dignity of my culture. Listening to this I was\
  \ awe-struck.Money isn\u2019t everything, and guide proved that, sometimes others\
  \ interests and willingness also matters. Every journey teaches something and this\
  \ time it taught me that sometimes making a connection with people and knowing them\
  \ helps a lot. I caught the train in noon and held my head high with pride."
