Text: "Vi\xF1ales is the oldest part of Cuba, geologically speaking. A UNESCO World\
  \ Heritage site, the region is an emerald green carpet of farmland punctuated by\
  \ massive limestone outcrops. This is tobacco country. \n\nLeaving our regular guide,\
  \ Julio, we set off into the valley with Luis. He takes us to a thatched \u201C\
  drying barn.\u201D There, we meet Diego, a farmer. He's slight but wiry. He has\
  \ the sun-burnished look of a man who spends nearly all his day outside.\n\nDiego\
  \ demonstrates how cigars are rolled. He's got a live one in his mouth, puffing\
  \ away.\n\nWe're told the farmers must sell ninety percent of their crop to the\
  \ government. But they\u2019re allowed to keep ten percent. \"Of course,\" Luis\
  \ translates for Diego, \"it's a big ten percent.\"\n\nDiego now circulates for\
  \ inspection and sample a home-made cigar. Each family has its own recipe, passed\
  \ down through the generations. The leaves can be prepared with water, sugar, honey,\
  \ rum, even tea. \n\nI\u2019m not a smoker. I drag on the cigar like a snorkel,\
  \ cough, and pass it along. Diego laughs and says something to Luis.\n\n\"He likes\
  \ your hat,\" says Luis.\n\n\"Thanks!\" It\u2019s a cowboy hat, with a fake leather\
  \ brim and a straw crown covered in swirling brown and orange. I had bought it a\
  \ week earlier.\n\n\"Can he see your hat?\" Luis asks.\n\n\"Sure.\" Diego takes\
  \ my hat, running his fingers around the brim. He puts it on his head and adjusts\
  \ it. It suits him better than me. He looks smart.\n\n\"He wants to know, where\
  \ did you get this hat?\"\n\n\"In Mexico.\"\n\nLuis translates, and Diego's eyes\
  \ light up. Travel abroad is something he cannot do.\n\n\"He wants to buy your hat,\"\
  \ says the guide. Diego watches me and puffs. \"Will you sell it?\"\n\n\"If he wants\
  \ it, he can have it,\" I say. It would have been cruel to refuse. Visitors recommend\
  \ leaving simple items like toothbrushes and sneakers for the locals. A man like\
  \ this needs a decent sunhat.\n\nDiego asks for a selfie with me. We go outside\
  \ for photos, which will eventually make their way onto a Facebook that neither\
  \ Diego nor Luis will ever see. \n\nAs we turn to leave, Diego grasps my hand in\
  \ his. With the other, he presents me with a bundle of his cigars. They're worth\
  \ US $40 on the open market. The hat cost me some loose change.\n\nBack in the village,\
  \ Julio returns to greet us and notices my hat is gone.\n\n\"Mister William, where\
  \ is your hat?\"\n\n\"I gave it to the farmer.\"\n\n\"Oh no! Why you are doing that?\u201D\
  \n\n\"What\u2019s wrong?\"\n\n\"Diego tries to get a new hat off someone every time!\
  \ He has a whole house full of hats!\""
