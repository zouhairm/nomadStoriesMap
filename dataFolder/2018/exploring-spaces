Text: "When I think of the ocean, I think of a vast amount of space that has been\
  \ unexplored, occupied by various forms of life and that thought used to send a\
  \ chill down my spine. But then I compare this to the world on a personal level\
  \ and I know the world needs exploring.\nYou will find the magic right at the tip\
  \ of the island, yet it is an attraction that remains the focus of Zakynthos. The\
  \ \u2018blue caves\u2019, known for its reflective light which drenches the rough,\
  \ rocky walls with stunning colour.\nStanding on the tour boat, the blazing sun\
  \ burned a spotlight on my back as I faced the waves below. It may have only been\
  \ a few seconds, but I could feel myself hesitating on the edge, the captain held\
  \ out his hand for guidance and urged me to dive in. I took it, this was something\
  \ I needed to experience.\nThe water was a fresh shock but as I accustomed, I took\
  \ in my surroundings.   A wave of reality hit me as I realised that I was facing\
  \ something that I wasn\u2019t entirely comfortable with; being out in the open\
  \ water was never something I had gotten used to. The thought that there was unknown\
  \ life lurking below me, fish freely circling around my feet was unreal. We had\
  \ also been informed that this area was not far from where shipwrecks occurred (shipwreck\
  \ beach) and this just made the swim even eerier. \nHowever, the water was calm\
  \ and after a few seconds of kicking my feet and pondering on whether to head back,\
  \ I found myself gaining courage, wanting to venture and explore further. The surrounding\
  \ water branched off into different coves, their white stone walls towering dauntingly\
  \ over us, but all garnering this air of mystery, pulling me into their presence.\
  \ I swam further, still wary of what was below but highly intrigued. \nI was not\
  \ disappointed as when I swam into a cave\u2019s sparkling light, I felt a strange\
  \ sensation, magic. I was engulfed in darkness from the surrounding stones, yet\
  \ I felt the blue lights shining strikingly across my face, across others.\nThe\
  \ caves emanated a vibrant life of their own, the blue light of the water\u2019\
  s reflection dancing against the stone. It is almost as if the waves are painting\
  \ their own stories, the rich history of the island comes alive through its own\
  \ walls. \nThe island has plenty to offer. But discovering its secrets really makes\
  \ you fall in love with its beauty. This is especially when nature creates such\
  \ a beauty to explore. To venture so out of my comfort zone, yet to experience such\
  \ magic was something I did not expect."
