Text: "A week into landing in Mumbai, I had fallen in love with the city. The loud,\
  \ colorful metropolis bustled with exotic sights and interesting people unlike my\
  \ drab old hometown. It was full of surprises: slip into a tiny lane and you\u2019\
  d land in a busy flea market, turn a bend and you\u2019d run right into an Iranian\
  \ cafe with the best bun maska in town. \nIt was sometime around then that I decided\
  \ to meet a friend of mine who lived there. I looked up her address and asked our\
  \ receptionist what the fastest way to reach her place was. \n\u201CThe local train,\
  \ ma\u2019am \u2013 no hassle, super cheap!\u201D\nThe Mumbai local train (or locals,\
  \ as Mumbaikars call it) is the easiest way of navigating a city which is notorious\
  \ for its traffic jams. As I stood on the platform waiting, I smiled as a gentle\
  \ swoosh of wind hit my face and a distant hoot reached my ears \u2013 I loved trains.\
  \ \nBut as the train arrived, my jaw dropped. I stood and gaped as coach after coach\
  \ bursting with people passed by. There were people everywhere: people hanging from\
  \ the sideboard, people pressed up against the window grills - there was no way\
  \ I could get in. Looking around for a way inside, I heard a woman shout. \n\u201C\
  Hey! Here!\u201D She waved at me, beckoning me to get inside. Seeing my helpless\
  \ expression, she grinned and caught my hand, yanking me in within the blink of\
  \ an eye. In a single breath, she yelled instructions at me over the ruckus in the\
  \ background. \u201CDon\u2019t move too far from the door, else you won\u2019t be\
  \ able to get out! Hold on to your purse tightly; things get stolen around here!\u201D\
  \ I nodded hurriedly as she disappeared into the crowd.   \nIn the few minutes that\
  \ I spent pressed up against a partition wall, I got a vague idea of how things\
  \ worked around here. The crowd was composed of three groups: veterans who have\
  \ been travelling the same routes for pretty long and helped the new ones, people\
  \ who weren\u2019t frequent travelers but knew what to expect, and total newbies\
  \ like me. As we moved on, people spilled out at every stop as more ones pushed\
  \ in. Finally, I got down at my stop (\u201Cgot pushed out\u201D would be accurate)\
  \ with the woman who had pulled me in, thanking her profusely, exhilarated by the\
  \ experience.\nI met my friend at a chic cafe nearby for some coffee. When I got\
  \ up to leave, she inquired how I was going to get back. \n\u201CThe local, of course.\u201D\
  \n\u201CAre you sure? It does get busy at this time.\u201D\nI smiled at her as I\
  \ thought of my unknown friend\u2019s outstretched hand, pulling me into the bustling\
  \ train.\n\u201CHell yeah.\u201D"
