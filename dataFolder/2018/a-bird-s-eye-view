Text: "Swallows flicked in and out of the eaves. From the shaded alleyways we emerged,\
  \ blinking, into sunlight bouncing off waterlogged fields. On one side, a water\
  \ buffalo, a white egret perched on its back, was tugging a wooden plough. On the\
  \ other, a dozen women wearing scarlet waistcoats were bent double, like a flock\
  \ of brightly coloured wading birds, deftly thrusting rice seedlings into muddy\
  \ water.\n\u201CLooks like we\u2019ve travelled back in time,\u201D I commented,\
  \ stopping to take some photos.\n\u201CThings are not what they seem,\u201D Yan\
  \ replied. \u201CThey all have mobile phones now.\u201D\nI\u2019d flown down from\
  \ Beijing to visit Yan's hometown for a long weekend. We\u2019d spent the morning\
  \ in the village of Xizhou, where I had been wowed by the traditional architecture:\
  \ intricately carved wooden doors with motifs of phoenix and crane, and delicate\
  \ murals on whitewashed walls. Yan had told me, rather cynically, that the locals\
  \ had been ordered to paint them to charm tourists.\nWe walked alongside irrigation\
  \ channels where farmers were opening sacks of fertilizer, and as a whiff of rotting\
  \ algae invaded our nostrils, we arrived at the shore of Lake Erhai, whose waters\
  \ stretched away, shimmering and calm. On the far side, hoary mountains retreated\
  \ into the haze, as though embarrassed to watch man fiddling with nature.\nYan approached\
  \ a fisherman who was squatting on the rocky jetty plucking a chicken. After a friendly\
  \ haggle, we climbed aboard a flat bottomed boat and were poled into open water.\n\
  \"They rely on tourists for income now. The lake is so polluted that fishing is\
  \ severely restricted.\" Then he pointed.\nAbout fifty metres away, in a boat like\
  \ ours, was a man in a straw hat leaning over something. After a few seconds a huge\
  \ bird jumped from the bottom of the boat and dived into the lake.\n\"It\u2019s\
  \ a cormorant,\" said Yan. As we slowly drifted closer, the black bird popped back\
  \ out of the water and into the boat. It dropped a fish from its beak onto the deck\
  \ and was rewarded by a tiddler from a bucket. It spread its oily wings and made\
  \ a keening cry.\n\"It\u2019s so well trained!\" I exclaimed.\n\"Actually, it has\
  \ a ring round its neck,\" came the reply, \"to stop it swallowing the big ones.\"\
  \nReturning later to the village by a different path, we passed an ancient Taoist\
  \ temple. Over its flaking facade were plastered four giant Chinese characters.\
  \ Yan helpfully translated the government's directive:\n\u201CBuild a harmonious\
  \ society.\u201D\nHigh above, wheeling and soaring, just being themselves, were\
  \ the swallows."
