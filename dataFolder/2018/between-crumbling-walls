Text: "When I was twenty, I decided to go live in Jerusalem for six months. I\u2019\
  ve always thought of Israel as a place of violence. A place of ancient holiness,\
  \ yes, but also, primarily, conflict and destruction and subjugation. So when I\
  \ arrived in Jerusalem, it was with mixed feelings. \n\nThe first day, I walked\
  \ the ancient blood-soaked stones and ate olives from the shuk with my bare hands.\
  \ I sweat in the overbearing heat. I bought falafel for lunch and chocolate-coated\
  \ ice cream for dinner. All around me was violence, as I had anticipated. I hid\
  \ in the bomb shelters when the sirens went off; I covered my body and avoided eye\
  \ contact with men across the street; I watched Muslims and Jews throw stones at\
  \ each other. Jerusalem is a place of broken promises, of anger and pain, of fervent\
  \ ideologies and their loyalists. I used to eat at a caf\xE9 with crumbling walls,\
  \ where the owner, a Moroccan Jew named Amar, would feed me pita bread with extra\
  \ hummus. One day, someone smashed the windows.\n\nAnd that\u2019s when I saw a\
  \ different side of this holy country. \n\nAmar picked up the broken glass because\
  \ he had to, even though it pricked his fingers and caused him great shame. But\
  \ he also did it because he brave. People could smash his windows once a week, and\
  \ Amar would still pick up the glass with his bare hands, and still serve extra\
  \ hummus to his customers at no charge, and still open the doors at 6 A.M. because\
  \ this was his life, and his restaurant, and he would fight for it. The people in\
  \ this country \u2013 of all backgrounds \u2013 do not give up hope that the violence\
  \ will end.\n\nEveryone I met there felt a submission to something greater: a god,\
  \ the city, newfound lovers, the desert heat in the Negev. I picked lemons on Kibbutzim\
  \ with Israelis who worshiped the power of the earth and trees. I drank tea in a\
  \ high tower with Arabs in Bethlehem while soldiers put up barbed wire on the other\
  \ side of the city.\n\nIsrael is a place of pain. But it is also a place of passion,\
  \ of resistance, and of longing for peace and justice. It has meaning to so many\
  \ different people. On my last day there, I ate watermelon on sand-colored Roman\
  \ stones, under the blinding sky. I watched the families walk by \u2013 Muslims,\
  \ Jews, Christians, and atheists, in the same place, loving the same land. It is\
  \ the most complex and wondrous country. I was shocked that this land held more\
  \ than just an endless war. But the truth is that most countries, and most people,\
  \ are not what they seem at first glance."
