Text: "\u201CPeople see him as a God.\u201D The words hung in the air like the thick,\
  \ muggy humidity that is typical of the densely forested landscape of southern Xishuangbanna.\
  \ Sam and I stood there silently staring at a picture of one of the most famous\
  \ men of the 20th century. It was late afternoon, and the coffee table sized picture\
  \ of a man, who is inseparable from the identity of modern China, hangs tightly\
  \ to the outside wall of an uncompleted building towards the center of a small Dai\
  \ ethnic village. In the west, we grew up having very mixed feelings about this\
  \ man, and even though I was born in the years post-cold war, we were still well\
  \ learned to the \u2018democracy vs. Communism\u2019 narrative that seemed to signify\
  \ the struggles and conflicts in the post WWII era world. Before coming to China\
  \ my preconceptions were clear, I knew about the cultural revolution, Tiananmen\
  \ Square and the other human rights issues that correlated in a less than positive\
  \ approval rating in many westerner\u2019s minds. But what about the Chinese people\
  \ themselves? What do they think about Mao Zedong? \nSam, my guide and interpreter,\
  \ with his pitch black hair and darker skin tone that often differentiates the Dai\
  \ people and other minority groups in Yunnan Province from the Han Chinese, gave\
  \ me the Dai people's answer. \u201CHe is seen as a father, a God.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ pictures of the legendary Chinese Communist party founder were posted everywhere\
  \ throughout the Dai village settled in the valley of the mountains, in a region\
  \ that feels much more like a southeast Asian country rather than typical China.\
  \ I found it ironic for there to be so many of these pictures amongst a group, known\
  \ for its spirituality. As my mind was pondering the steep complexity of Sam\u2019\
  s response to my question, I finally blurted out and remarked, \u201CWhy? What about\
  \ the cultural revolution? When the Buddhist temples were burnt and the monks beaten?\u201D\
  \ Sam, in his usual response to my questions pertaining to politics and other things\
  \ not associated with Dai culture and Theravada Buddhism (which was his specialty\
  \ and why I hired him) shrugged indifferently, and said, \u201CThat was a long time\
  \ ago, most people have forgotten now.\u201D  \n\nBefore we moved on from the picture\
  \ and made our way up a dragon style staircase to the town's Theravada Buddhist\
  \ temple, a thought crossed my mind that i dared not utter but remained with me\
  \ long after I left China and Asia, 'Mao once said religion is poison. Now he's\
  \ revered as a God...is he turning in his grave?'"
