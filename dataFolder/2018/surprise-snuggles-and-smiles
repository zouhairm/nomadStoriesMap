Text: "Flights were...okay. Expensive, but not the worst they could've been. They\
  \ were also LONG. Thirteen plus hours from Toronto to Taipei (a place I'd never\
  \ been before, or considered going to), a seventeen hour layover, then another nine\
  \ hours to Brisbane?\n\nI like travelling and all but did I like it enough to spend\
  \ that much money and time on a trip I could easily do in a year's time?\n\nI picked\
  \ up my phone and scrolled through the hundreds of photos I'd screenshotted of my\
  \ baby nephew over the past few months. I looked at his cheeky smile, his chubby\
  \ arms and legs, the tiny hairs on his head. I watched the videos of him giggling\
  \ like crazy at a dinosaur chomping noise my sister made up.  The decision became\
  \ clear. It was easy. Yes, eventually that would all be worth it - just to see that\
  \ little man, even if only for a few days.\n\nSo I did it. I booked the flights.\
  \ I counted down the days. I spent the excruciatingly long hours on the planes.\
  \ I made my way through immigration to spend the day outside exploring Taiwan, and\
  \ not willing away my life in the airport. \n\nThen finally, I was home. Only this\
  \ time, it was a surprise.\n\nIf anyone ever asks me \"what is the best day in your\
  \ life?\" or \"what day would you go back and re-live?\", the answers are simple.\
  \ The day my nephew was born. The day I surprised my family at home for Christmas.\
  \ \n\nI will never forget the look on my mother's face when she opened the door.\
  \ The way her jaw dropped in complete shock, and she shrieked \"Oh my god! What\
  \ are you doing here?\" \n\nI will never forget my sister and father crying at my\
  \ sudden appearance.\n\nI will never forget my sister instantly thrusting my nephew\
  \ into my arms for a much-delayed cuddle.\n\nI will never forget my nephew and I\
  \ quickly becoming best mates.\n\nIt was a shining example of why travelling is\
  \ so wonderful. They're always in my thoughts and heart. Even though I feel so far\
  \ from them at times, I'm really not."
