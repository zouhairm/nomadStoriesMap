Text: "The Museum of Death in New Orleans is no stranger to falling ovations. When\
  \ I bought my ticket, I was told just how many people had fainted or vomited that\
  \ day. Possibly I would become another number in that Thursday\u2019s statistic\
  \ as I made my way through displays that housed everything from antique embalming\
  \ tables to photos of gruesome crime scenes and the worst parts of World War II.\
  \ \n\nThe museum claims to exist to educate people about death, but when I first\
  \ headed through the curtain, the museum seemed like a weird niche place \u2014\
  something strange for tourists to take in so they could report back to friends and\
  \ family later about their little foray into the macabre. Fascination with death\
  \ is something humans have always had after all. \n\nAt first, this was what it\
  \ was for me as well. I took in the death masks of everyone from Robin Williams\
  \ to Hitler with a sense of detachment. I looked at artwork and letters from infamous\
  \ serial killers and wondered vaguely why we would want to have museum exhibits\
  \ about them at all. I was purposely holding myself at arm\u2019s length from the\
  \ exhibits out of fear that I might join the unintentionally unconscious. \n\nIt\
  \ wasn\u2019t until I hit the second side of the museum that I was forced to actively\
  \ feel. Staring at piles of war victims while footage of 9/11 played on a loop drastically\
  \ shifted the mood. I was no longer looking at antique death gowns and mortician\u2019\
  s tools. I was looking at real people who had lived and died in horrible ways. \n\
  \nIt was an assault on my senses\u2014the grisly photos coupled with firsthand accounts\
  \ of what happened on that fateful September day. All combined, it was dreadful,\
  \ sobering, horrible. \n\nI could finally see why people often fainted or lost their\
  \ lunch. \n\nAt the same time though, I could see the value in it and while I\u2019\
  m not sure I got the education the museum intended to offer, I did get one. There,\
  \ faced with the worst of what mankind can do to one another and the fragility of\
  \ life as a whole, I felt a profound sense of heartbreak. Most of what I saw and\
  \ heard that day were images and stories of unnecessary death and suffering. \n\n\
  When I walked back out through the curtains, I did so with a sense of empathy for\
  \ all of humanity that I have never experienced prior to my trip into this strange\
  \ little piece of New Orleans. \n\nFalling ovations and vomit may be commonplace\
  \ at the Museum of Death, but maybe they\u2019re missing the statistic that truly\
  \ matters."
