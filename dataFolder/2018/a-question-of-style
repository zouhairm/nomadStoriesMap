Text: "\"Can I take a picture with you?\" . This question punctuated my month-long\
  \ trip to Seoul, South Korea.\nWhether it's at Sungkyunkwan University, at the restaurant\
  \ while I eat for the first time with chopsticks , or in a club next to the women's\
  \ toilet. Clearly, the Korean people like to take anything and everything in pictures.\
  \ They live with a smartphone in their hands and my blond hair didn't go unnoticed.\n\
  \nHow can I do that we don't see this difference? Those blonde hair in the middle\
  \ of these pretty brown heads?\nI decided to change my look and become a real Korean\
  \ student.\n\nEvery day, my outfit was accessorized with Sushi or Donuts socks,\
  \ a pink cap and other little things that only the Korean have the secret. Question\
  \ style, there is no saying, the Korean are formidable opponents and redoubling\
  \ imagination and creativity. We can dare everything. \n\nI managed to blend in\
  \ with the crowd. Then, during a visit to the palace, we decide to dress in Hanbok\
  \ with some friends. This is the traditional Korean outfit.\nIn this outfit, in\
  \ front of this historic and majestic monument, I suddenly understand that everything\
  \ is not superficial. Korea is also a beautiful country steeped in history.\n\n\
  Seoul is a city with many faces. Seoul is wild as its mountains, traditional as\
  \ its culture and its monuments and living like these inhabitants.\nThis trip reminds\
  \ me every day to be myself and that difference is a strength because after it comes\
  \ acceptance ... and often it is the traveler who accepts."
