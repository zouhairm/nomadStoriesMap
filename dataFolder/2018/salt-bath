Text: "I woke up early, before the alarm clock, not knowing what to expect. My backpack\
  \ was ready in a corner of the room, I had separated a suit for the trip. I got\
  \ dressed, took my belongings, and with two other friends, I waited.\n\nI was prepared\
  \ for the worst. I kept medicines in the bag to combat soroche, such as dipyrone,\
  \ acetaminophen, and aspirin. A body moisturizer and a lip balm, eye drops and a\
  \ nasal fluidizer. There could be no room for error, for four days I would be isolated\
  \ in an inhospitable region.\n\nIt was the second night of the trip. An entire lodging\
  \ of salt, floor, walls, tables. All around, only greenery. The dark sky announced\
  \ rain. Most travelers were Brazilian, so it was easy to pretend they were not so\
  \ far from home.\n\nThe characteristic noise of rain began and gained strength.\
  \ Our guide, Valerio, warned that we would have to wait to see if we would be able\
  \ to watch the sunrise at Uyuni Salt Flats. The water began to invade our salt fortress.\
  \ That rain in December was not expected.\n\nDespite the fear of losing the highlight\
  \ of the trip, near the end, the balance had been positive. Simple but comfortable\
  \ accommodations with hot bath and delicious food. The hours inside the car were\
  \ offset by the breathtaking scenery at every stop.\n\nThroughout the days, I was\
  \ stripping myself of vanities and guilt. I have been learning to live with less,\
  \ to live simple, I have been learning to stay offline. \n\nThere, in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, with no sign of the outside world, all that mattered was nature, the\
  \ connection with people, and especially myself.\n\nDecember 30, 2017. Penultimate\
  \ day of a difficult year, facing the unemployment that plagued Brazil, and which\
  \ gave me monthly crises of anxieties. The penultimate day that made up for a whole\
  \ year.\n\nWe spent almost two hours in the car before we saw the first white spots.\
  \ First, a dirty salt, mixed with the wet floor of last night's rain. The white\
  \ rose and gained space, until it dominated the whole landscape.\n\nSilence dominated\
  \ the car, and the only noise was of the wheels kneading the salt. The magic was\
  \ happening as we moved into the desert. The rain had turned the salt into a mirror,\
  \ which reflected the sky. I was prepared for a trip with incredible scenery, but\
  \ that went beyond all the photos, videos and reports. The salt took away everything\
  \ bad that I carried throughout the year, and returned it renewed for the following\
  \ year."
