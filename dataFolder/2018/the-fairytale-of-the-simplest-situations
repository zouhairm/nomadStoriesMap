Text: "It was a sunny Sunday afternoon in Bali, the weather had been nice and hot\
  \ for a few days, despite the rainy season. Once again, Camila was considering how\
  \ to spend her day on her own, her friends were either too hungover or too boring\
  \ to come with her. But she was craving for adventure, for something unique and\
  \ authentic, that no one had experienced. She googled \u201Cthings to do in the\
  \ area\u201D. She found a mention of an ancient royal Palace in the remote village\
  \ of Kerambitan on a very old blog and knew immediately this was it. She took her\
  \ scooter and rode, feeling alive, free and whole. \nShe arrived in the village\
  \ and saw it. It was a traditional Balinese compound, made of several buildings\
  \ and courtyards, magnificent in its royal aura, but it had seen better days for\
  \ sure. As she walked towards the heart of the structure, she felt intimidated because\
  \ she was in someone else\u2019s home, but willing to get till the end of her crazy\
  \ idea. \nSomeone must have listened to her prayers, as she found an old man sitting\
  \ in one of the courtyards. He greeted her friendly, invited her to sit down and\
  \ grab a tea. He said he was Oka, the Prince of the compound. They chatted for several\
  \ hours. She felt like listening to a fairy tale, when he told her the story of\
  \ his family, of his ancestor who fought against his brother for the reign of their\
  \ father, lost and founded a new kingdom.  And she felt melancholic when he mentioned\
  \ the present days, when there is no more room for a King in a Republic and maintaining\
  \ such a Palace is too costly. \nHe enjoyed having someone to talk to, the first\
  \ visitor in several months and the first deeper conversation since his son visited\
  \ him the previous week. Oka was feeling lonely in the Palace. There was something\
  \ in Camila\u2019s eyes that reminded him of his defunct wife, the same light and\
  \ vitality he fell in love with the first time he saw her. He burst into tears and\
  \ blessed the Gods for this visit that was taking out so many emotions and memories.\
  \ \nHe showed her the entire Palace, including the temple and all the ancient areas\
  \ for representation. It felt good to turn on those lights and see those rooms one\
  \ more time. Talking with the young Western woman made him feel so alive, she was\
  \ listening so carefully and respectfully. For Oka, it was the best afternoon in\
  \ a very long time, for Camila an amazing travel story and connection. \nShe left\
  \ before dawn feeling grateful for this connection; she would have never expected\
  \ such a great afternoon."
