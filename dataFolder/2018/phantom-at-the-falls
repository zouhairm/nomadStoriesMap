Text: "The collectivo taxi winds through the Mayan jungle towards Roberto Barrios,\
  \ a pueblita deep in Zapatista territory near the Mexican border with Guatemala,\
  \ home to a set of remote tropical waterfalls. Rounding a corner, I spot a cluster\
  \ of huts nestled in a wide clearing. We pay the driver and climb down into thick\
  \ brush as giant bugs scurry over our bare feet. A steep path covered in leaves\
  \ and vines twists down to a sun dappled pool. Groups of  tourists are splashing\
  \ about. I can see the sheen of sun tan lotion on the water and we decide to head\
  \ deeper, past another set of falls to a wide, clear plunge pool.  We spend the\
  \ afternoon skinny dipping and exploring the shallow falls, until the sun goes down\
  \ and we build a fire in a deep crater sheltered by a rocky outcrop. Arturo talks\
  \ of his last trip to Roberto Barrios, when he was caught by the Zapatistas. \u201C\
  They came at night, Surrounded me, ten of them with machetes. They told me I had\
  \ to leave and put me in a truck, drove me 20 miles out of the jungle. Didn't hurt\
  \ me, but those guys are scary man.\" Its far too dark to try and leave, and we're\
  \ used to sleeping under the stars, so decide to stay round the fire under glow-worm\
  \ constellations, listening in awe to the ethereal shrieks of howler monkeys.  We\
  \ are all relaxed, warm and content, when a tropical storm starts, instantly soaking\
  \ everything and deluging the crater which slowly starts to flood. We take it in\
  \ turns to scramble up the steep sides of the crater, scavenging for wood while\
  \ the rest stand sheltering the fire. After many exhausting hours of battling nature,\
  \ we have built a huge fire and attempt to sleep in the shelter, shivering in damp\
  \ clothes. Waking just as dawn creeps into the crater I notice the rain stop; the\
  \ noise of running water replaced by panting. In the half-light I see a huge dark\
  \ animal, its head in our food bag; I stare silently at it, trying to convince myself\
  \ its a stray dog and slip back to sleep. In the warmth of the morning sun, the\
  \ tribulations of the night melt away, and danger seems impossibly far from this\
  \ unspoiled paradise. I tell Arturo about the nocturnal visitor; He gulps in surprise\
  \ as he whispers back to me \u201CDon't tell the others- That was definitely a jaguar!\u201D\
  \ I really can't tell if he's messing with me. He suddenly brightens up, with a\
  \ huge grin, \u201CJust try not to think about it!\u201D I stare across the water,\
  \ misty in the morning sun, pondering what may be sleeping in the undergrowth on\
  \ the far side."
