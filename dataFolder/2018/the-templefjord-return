Text: "The dream to go to Svalbard was to experience the northern lights, the coldest\
  \ weather, the polar bears, the walruses, the seals and the lively loneliness. My\
  \ wife and me, we experienced all of it but only after overcoming something we\u2019\
  d never dreamt of. \n\nIt started with the agency forgetting us for a 10-hour Templefjord\
  \ return ride. Our bad luck could\u2019ve been rectified only via riding a huge\
  \ snow mobile with a tutor, the only fellow rider. My wife and I were non-drivers\
  \ and afraid but extremely excited. I gambled to undertake the most exotic unreal\
  \ challenge that conspired to blind snowmobiling.  \n\nThe start was easy but staying\
  \ alive became impossible, quickly. I had to ride on slant slopes. At minus 30 degrees\
  \ Celsius, there was a risk to drift and drown in the iced sea on the right. Wife\
  \ didn\u2019t know how to swim; I didn\u2019t know how not to drift and strictly\
  \ drive on the left. Perilous slopes started the riskiest challenge. \n\nWe overcame\
  \ the risky challenge somehow but we also had to overcome an unseen icy revolution.\
  \ We had never driven on an ice crossover. The tutor went over the icy part easily.\
  \ We followed him with obvious ignorance and without slowing down. We revolved for\
  \ 360 degrees twice to cover 200 meters. The first revolution was scary but in the\
  \ 2nd one, the ice under our bike was broken but we luckily escaped in minutest\
  \ seconds. \n\nWe reached the end, where we had only one small home to sit in. We\
  \ saw multiple seals & walruses. We locked ourselves inside for safety & to eat.\
  \ We heard knocks and the voice of the invisible polar bear, which we desperately\
  \ wanted to see but we kept quiet to stay alive. The tutor kept his huge rifle ready.\
  \ After an hour of furious scare, quietness and anticipation, we couldn\u2019t hear\
  \ anything and that allowed us to move out, to push back.\n\nWe shook away some\
  \ fear but requested that both of us shall sit behind the tutor for riding back.\
  \ It was unaccepted. We started slowly but we had to rebound through blindness because\
  \ of extreme negative temperature, an infuriating blowing wind and an unreal sweeping\
  \ ice storm. The fear of encountering polar bears was simmering. The tutor became\
  \ unseen. We had zero visibility of the way back, the broken ice, the slopes, the\
  \ dangerous animals and everything else. We luckily survived. \n\nUnlimited efforts\
  \ of fighting the climate, giving up fear, moving forward and winning against never\
  \ experienced moments, kept us alive, made us stronger and got us back."
