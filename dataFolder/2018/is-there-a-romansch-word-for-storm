Text: "High above blissful Flims, I internally screamed, \"one day, when you\u2019\
  re a decrepit old woman you will wildly cackle. Now Bear Grylls this situation and\
  \ get on with it!\" The hike began wonderfully \u2013 some fat marmot sightings,\
  \ gorgeous wild flowers, and the dinging of distant cow bells. The weather was fine\
  \ too.\n\nMy first unexpected challenge; angry, grazing cows. Realising the unison\
  \ of clanging bells meant they were charging toward me, I ran through the muddy\
  \ terrain while fleeing the mob protective of their calves. Fair enough. I was in\
  \ their territory. With a safe amount of distance to catch my breath, my next exploit\
  \ was to traverse a waterfall. The precariously placed log was slippery, as was\
  \ the sudden scramble up the steep hill.\n\nThe last thing I expected was the grumbling\
  \ storm lurching from behind me. The trail sign pointedly declared I was one hour\
  \ away from the closest cable car to the village below. I quickened my pace as large\
  \ rain droplets blurred my glasses and vision. Scrambling got more tiresome as hills\
  \ became streams from the deluge. Now I did feel panicked, which is understandable,\
  \ right? Solo hiker, an unanticipated storm, and not a human (or angry cow) in sight!\n\
  \nAlone. No one knew where I was. I was trying my best to quell the rising panic,\
  \ but I was discombobulating. It began to overcome me. I abruptly vomited on some\
  \ wild flowers. A low point, yes. I did find a rock to cover 'the fear', mentally\
  \ calculating that this cancelled out the biological reaction to my predicament\
  \ \u2013 leave no trace. Instantly, I was calm and continued.\n\nIntermittently,\
  \ I crumpled to rest, wiping my fogged glasses and hiding uselessly under my umbrella.\
  \ I could hear rumbling machinery in the near distance. The cable car! No. Once\
  \ closer, I could see it was a yellow earth mover. Who on earth would move earth\
  \ in this weather? Who on earth would hike in this weather? I waved and attempted\
  \ to ask for directions, pointing to my water-logged map. In my terrible Romansh\
  \ and his broken English, I learned I had another 10 minutes of the trail ahead\
  \ of me. \n\nFinally, I was able to fling my rain-soaked and muddied self on to\
  \ a cable car seat. Mirroring my muddy presence were other local drenched hikers.\
  \ Vigorous sign language, defiant pointing to the sky, and further broken conversation\
  \ meant I too was not alone. We celebrated with a high five and sharing of drenched\
  \ snacks. Was this the adventure I had expected when I set off on my alpine hike?\
  \ In some ways, absolutely!"
