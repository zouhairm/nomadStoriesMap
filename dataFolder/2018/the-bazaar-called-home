Text: "There are no boards to welcome you, but when the landscape oscillates between\
  \ green fields full of coconut trees to desolate boulder-filled lands you know you\u2019\
  re in Hampi\nHampi\u2019s local bazaar had been more than a marketplace in the 7th\
  \ century; it was a place of gathering for celebration and prayer. The Virupaksha\
  \ temple, with its peculiar carvings, lies to its north. Massive stone pavilions\
  \ that once housed market booths, line both sides of the road which was the pathway\
  \ for warriors of the prosperous Vijayanagara Empire to ride their chariots to the\
  \ house of their gods. \nI imagined the once bustling bazaar nestled amidst the\
  \ relic; brought to life by vendors, citizens and even nobility of the Empire who\
  \ also called its premises home. But I would learn from Siva that the remains had\
  \ also been home to over three hundred families up until 2011.\nSiva was one of\
  \ the few dozen teenage boys trying to convince tourists to rent motorcycles from\
  \ them.\n\u201CYou want a bike?\u201D he asked me, with the smile of a charismatic\
  \ salesman.\n\u201CI don\u2019t know how to ride one,\u201D I confessed.\nHe looked\
  \ at me with an expression that can be best described as a mix of confusion and\
  \ amusement. Laughing, he offered to drive me around.\nBefore we began our excursion\
  \ I sat on the floor in Siva\u2019s home, taking in the aroma from the mix of rice,\
  \ lentils, tamarind pulp and a trove of spices. His mother Anjamma was treating\
  \ me to Bisi bele bath for breakfast. \u201CDid you know we had a home in the bazaar?\
  \ I used to run the best canteen in Hampi there,\u201D she said, proudly.\nLike\
  \ them, the natives of Hampi made a living by catering to the needs of tourists\
  \ and pilgrims. But that was before the night in July 2011, when government officials\
  \ painted red crosses on all their houses and the following morning declared that\
  \ bulldozers were on their way to demolish them.\n\u201CThe house had been in my\
  \ family for centuries,\u201D Siva told me, \u201Cbut now it is rubble. They told\
  \ us that the land belongs to the government and we were encroaching illegally.\
  \ We were moved to these huts, with promises of money that never came, to help us\
  \ build new homes and start over.\u201D\nThe demolitions were a consequence of Hampi\
  \ being declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 2011. Adorned and spruced up,\
  \ it was thrown open to visitors from all over the world as a time capsule preserving\
  \ a glimpse of the region\u2019s magnificent past. In the process, the personal\
  \ history of Hampi\u2019s own saw a violent erasure. Like Siva\u2019s home, it is\
  \ lost forever."
