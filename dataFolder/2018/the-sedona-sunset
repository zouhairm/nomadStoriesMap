Text: "I began my trip in America with constant planning, but slowly became more lenient\
  \ as I grew confident travelling alone. Whilst in Sedona, an Arizona town known\
  \ for its beauty, I impulsively visited one of many local landmarks to witness the\
  \ sunset. An Uber driver took me out of town to a formation known as \u2018Bell\
  \ Rock\u2019. As I left the car, its large red shape stuck out in the distance.\
  \ Other vehicles were dotted around the car park. The driver gave me his number\
  \ so I could contact him later. Having the number as a safety net, I walked on at\
  \ a brisk pace to reach the top of Bell Rock by sunset. I didn\u2019t even reach\
  \ the base before it got dark.\nA mountain covered the sun. Bugs swarmed around\
  \ me. Though it was darker, the heat remained. I smiled at hikers as they returned\
  \ to their cars. Each one added to my uncertainty. By the time I started to ascend\
  \ a thin incline, I was sweating, covered in bites, and broken by this failed excursion.\
  \ I then checked my phone: It had no reception. I retreated down the vague, darkened\
  \ path, checking my phone as I went. The parking lot was virtually empty, and I\
  \ was left looking down a pitch-black road. The sun hid behind the mountainous rocks\
  \ this road clung to. I began to walk, sweating from both heat and dread.\nHeadlights\
  \ shone behind me. Afraid and desperate, I put my thumb out. The car stopped, and\
  \ an older couple apologised, explaining that they had no room. I smiled and said\
  \ I understood, trying to hide my distress. Luckily, something made them change\
  \ their minds. They readjusted some furniture on the backseat and I crawled in.\
  \ They were a Finnish couple, both of whom travelled here long ago. Now they had\
  \ returned to stay. I explained that I was trying to see the sunset before I left,\
  \ but through sheer unpreparedness had instead left myself abandoned in the darkened\
  \ desert. They understood, and took a detour.\nWe arrived at the top of an outlook\
  \ called Airport Mesa. Others gathered to watch the sunset. The sun emitted an mellowed\
  \ light across the yellowing landscape. Shimmers of white and cool blue broke out\
  \ behind the clouds. I saw the Sedona lights below. The couple took photos of the\
  \ sunset. After a few moments, the sun vanished on the opposite end of town. The\
  \ couple drove me back, and wished me luck.\nThis image of the Sedona sunset remains\
  \ one of the most calming and pure I have witnessed, and it only came about through\
  \ a poorly planned trip to the desert and a desperate attempt at hitchhiking."
