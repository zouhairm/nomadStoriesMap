Text: "I watched the dust settle along the dirt road. The first car in hours, a back-heavy\
  \ blue produce truck, rattled alongside the railroad tracks, rustling the tall grass\
  \ that leaned against the old wooden fence. A warm breeze played with my hair as\
  \ I sat in the shade of the Paestum station, waiting for the train that was scheduled\
  \ to arrive in an hour. I was pouring over my journal, scribbling in every detail\
  \ that came to my subtlety panic-stricken brain. Never had I been so aware of being\
  \ alone. At eighteen, I\u2019d never ventured so far from home, let alone done so\
  \ in another country where home was a volunteer apartment shared with a dozen social\
  \ drunkards in the heart of vibrant Naples. I\u2019d managed to make a good day\
  \ for myself, but now that day was over. I needed to write. I needed to breathe.\
  \ I needed a hug. While I etched my anxiety into my book, an old man strolled towards\
  \ me along the country lane. I felt him pause, and I tensed, afraid to look up.\
  \ His hand hit my shoulder like a bolt of lighting. Should I have screamed? Was\
  \ it too late to run?  His voice came like a stream of water through dry rocks.\
  \ \u201CBella scrittura,\u201D he told me, his eyes creased from years of easy smiles,\
  \ his teeth like the columns of the ancient temples on the horizon. He pointed to\
  \ the scribbles on my page. It took me a moment to make the connection. My own smile\
  \ broke my chapped lips. \u201CGrazie,\u201D I replied. I wanted to tell him he\u2019\
  d just made my day. That, for a second, and how funny it now seemed, I thought he\
  \ was going to hurt me. I wanted to ask for his name, but I didn\u2019t know how.\
  \ He patted my shoulder like I was his own grandson, nodded, and then shuffled away,\
  \ his gap-toothed grin lingering in the thick farmyard air. I would never see this\
  \ man again. The memory of him would be challenged in the coming days, weeks, months,\
  \ when newer, bigger adventures would take the place of this one. Yet, as I stared\
  \ out the train window at the green fields that shifted into grey, graffiti-laden\
  \ concrete structures, and Valencia-orange-coloured apartment complexes, my eyes\
  \ twinkled with promise. I would not forget him. A man I had only known for a split\
  \ second had shown me more humanity than any English-speaker I had or would meet\
  \ that year. He sparked a tiny flame of confidence in me that hot spring afternoon.\
  \ I have beautiful writing, I thought. I must have beautiful writing. Grazie mille\
  \ signore, I hope you\u2019re still smiling."
