Text: "If you\u2019re a frequent user of squat toilets located in rural Nepal, you\u2019\
  ll probably know not to look too closely, or breathe in.\nNepal is the diarrhoea\
  \ Capital of Asia and this was disgustingly obvious. When I had to go, I closed\
  \ my eyes and pretended a sparkly white toilet was below me with shiny blue tiles\
  \ under my hotel flip-flops. As my mind was in the clouds, the toilet roll slipped\
  \ through my fingers and went down the grimy pan into the depths of hell.\nPanic\
  \ kicked in.\nI ran out of the shack to my concrete home to find my roommate, dragging\
  \ her after me in pure confusion. No words were made as all I could do was howl\
  \ with embarrassed laughter. Thankfully, she still followed.\nWe squeezed into the\
  \ tiny shack and stared down the squat toilet at the disaster. Although toilet rolls\
  \ were sacred, the bigger issue was that the plumbing was blocked.\n\u201CHow do\
  \ we sort this out?\u201D Despite all of our training for a range of situations,\
  \ this was not covered. Should I do something about it or just leave it for someone\
  \ else to deal with? I was tempted\u2026\nBefore we could flee the scene, three\
  \ teenage villagers turned up to see what was happening, attracted by our fits of\
  \ laughter. Giggling away, they were whispering in Nepali, probably saying \u201C\
  what idiots.\u201D\nWe had to do something now. We\u2019d been caught.\nMy roommate\
  \ and I grabbed two sticks and lodged them on either side of the soaking, stained,\
  \ toilet roll to hike it out. The first time it plopped straight back it, splashing\
  \ sludge dangerously close to our flip-flops.\nDetermined not to be defeated, we\
  \ launched another assault, while laughter increased from the audience that was\
  \ getting larger by the minute. Even the local resident lizard stared: if I could\
  \ understand lizard then I\u2019m sure he would have been calling us stupid too.\n\
  Two more attacks and the toilet roll was impaled by two very poopy sticks and held\
  \ as far from our bodies as our arms would allow.\n\u201CWhat do we do now?\u201D\
  \ We asked each other with blank faces.\n\u201CBurn it.\u201D\nNepali rubbish is\
  \ either dropped on the floor or burnt. I\u2019m not sure if you\u2019ve ever tried\
  \ to burn a stinky, soaked toilet roll but it doesn\u2019t work well. We held a\
  \ lighter to it, we burnt an old piece of dry toilet roll and held it to the wet\
  \ one but it was impossible. This memory could not be burnt. It would have to dry\
  \ out. So every day for the next few weeks, we walked past my stinky mistake.\n\
  If leaning over a diarrhoea covered squat toilet isn\u2019t classed as the edge,\
  \ then I don\u2019t know what is."
