Text: "The event occurred in Buenos Aires, more specifically in the \u201CTren de\
  \ la Costa\u201D. During the train ride I sat in front of an old man who was reading\
  \ an old book which pages had already turned yellow. Beside him, on the other seat,\
  \ lay a stack of old books. I watched through the window without paying much attention\
  \ to my surroundings until the man touched my shoulder with his index finger. When\
  \ he got my attention he started talking to me. The teachers had warned us that\
  \ we were no longer in our quiet little town where most people knew each other;\
  \ we were in a big city full of dangers. However, I thought it was discourteous\
  \ to ignore him, so I decided to talk to him, but without lowering my guard.\n-Do\
  \ you like reading books?\n-Yes.\n-That is good. I'd like to give you these books.\n\
  -You do not even know me. Why do you want to give them to me?\n\u2014Soon I will\
  \ move to a nursing home and I do not want these books to be kept there. I want\
  \ to give them another chance, but nobody accepts them, they always reject them.\
  \ Is it because they are deteriorated?\n- Can be. I like new books. On the other\
  \ hand, I have a box full of old books at home that I never read.\n-Please, do not\
  \ reject them. Keep them.\n- Why do you force me to accept them?\n-I have to get\
  \ off the train now. Promise me that you will read them.\n- Okay. I promise.\nThe\
  \ man got off the train and said goodbye cheerfully. As for me, I was wondering\
  \ what I would do with those old books with torn and loose pages that were bothering\
  \ me in my backpack. I had only made the promise to please him, but I did not intend\
  \ to read any of those books. My friends advised me to throw them away or to leave\
  \ them somewhere for someone to find them. Before leaving the books on the train's\
  \ seat, I decided to leaf through them just out of curiosity, and in one of them\
  \ I found a piece of paper, it was a note that said: \"Thank you for giving my books\
  \ a new home.\" After reading the note I began to feel a little guilty and I was\
  \ convinced that I would regret if I got rid of them.\nOne of the books that the\
  \ man handed me was incomplete, the first 12 pages were missing and the book had\
  \ no end. I tried to look for it on the internet but I didn't have the title of\
  \ the book so it was impossible and it's a shame because the story was really interesting\
  \ and I still do not know the end. I have been waiting to know the name of that\
  \ book since I was 13 years old, it has been a while, but I do not lose hope of\
  \ being able to find it someday."
