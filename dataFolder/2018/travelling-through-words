Text: "The sudden whiff of mustard from the fields our train whizzed past brought\
  \ me back to reality. Our journey of almost 56 hours on the train was about to end.\
  \ Chuckling at my impulsive decision of joining a group of seniors I never really\
  \ knew to a trip to the northern part of the country all the way from the south\
  \ was certainly not expected! What could I say, the travel bug in me was quite potent.\
  \ I found the train journey, a journey within itself because the train was surely\
  \ taking me to a place but it was the people climbing in and out throughout the\
  \ journey that took me to many places in their heads and heart. It was the unnoticed\
  \ minuscule things in the eyes and hands of the people, the changing hues of green\
  \ in the fields from the two ends of the country, the scents of hair oil preferences\
  \ changing that aroused the poet in me.\n\nIn Himachal, it was the homespun life\
  \ of the people that I enjoyed exploring along with the uncharted places telling\
  \ stories more than pictures could tell. Amongst all these people, the gardener\
  \ lady at our cottage had piqued my interest. She seemed lost and desolated but\
  \ probably it was my relentless small talks that she gave in and shared her traveling\
  \ stories.\n\nI discovered little things like how the sun turned their eyes epicanthic,\
  \ how they considered people of the plains unhealthy because they didn\u2019t have\
  \ the habit of walking, how they differentiated northerners from southerners on\
  \ the basis of color. Spending time with her and the other locals around, I realized\
  \ people held more history, more stories in them than any museum could.  I\u2019\
  d always tell the gardener lady my observations and she\u2019d smile listening while\
  \ her fingers danced out around the strings of the headgear all older women seem\
  \ to wore.\n\nThe week passed and my time of departure came and while I stood there\
  \ packing dejectedly, the cottage owner came up to me and handed me pullas- a woolen\
  \ handmade shoe worn by the locals. He said the gardener lady had left them for\
  \ me. the surprise plastered on my face left him with a sigh and said that the lady\
  \ had lost her husband, children, and grandchildren right in front of her eyes and\
  \ had detached herself from everyone, communicating barely with nods and waves after\
  \ the tragedy. And the pullas she left for me was an invitation to come back, this\
  \ time to her home cause a daughter ought to live with her mother, not a motel.\n\
  \nThat very moment I realized no matter how many places we go to, it was always\
  \ in a person we find a world."
