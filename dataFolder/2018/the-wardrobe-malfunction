Text: "When you visit Edinburgh, the one thing that everyone says that you HAVE to\
  \ do, is to climb Arthur\u2019s Seat, the mythically famous hill which looms over\
  \ the city. Before I went, I didn\u2019t really understand the magnitude of this\
  \ trek. I mean, it is right in the centre of the city. How big can this hill actually\
  \ be? The answer = big. Not Mount Everest big, but still big.  \nEven when I arrived\
  \ though, I didn\u2019t treat it with enough reverence. It was just kind of there,\
  \ something I was going to tackle because everyone told me to. I didn\u2019t even\
  \ give it a proper slot in my itinerary. It was in the sidelines, as something to\
  \ fit in amongst other activities, if I had a free hour or two. \nThe morning before\
  \ I climbed Arthur\u2019s Seat, I had met another solo traveller in the castle.\
  \ He was Australian, really good looking and a firefighter. We clicked straight\
  \ away - what was not to love? We hung out for the rest of the day and, as he was\
  \ leaving the following day, it was him who suggested we should nip up the hill.\
  \ Good idea. It wasn\u2019t dark yet, we had completed everything else we wanted\
  \ to see. Why not?\nSo I, dressed in skinny jeans and heeled Chelsea boots, slipped\
  \ and stumbled up this hill. Holding on to the Australian\u2019s hand as if my life\
  \ depended on it. To be honest, on the way back down, my life DID depend on it.\
  \ My boots had absolutely no grip at all and the stone steps carved into the hill\
  \ had been worn away into smoothness by the tourists. One tiny misstep I would have\
  \ slipped down the whole hillside and probably broken my back on the steps for good\
  \ measure. \nIt was so worth it though. Potentially it wouldn\u2019t have been if\
  \ I had succeeded in paralysing myself due to dodgy wardrobe choices but, in hindsight,\
  \ I can assure you it was a wonderful experience. We arrived at the top just as\
  \ the sun was setting over the city. We could watch the lights turn on one by one\
  \ and were completely surrounded by the beautiful pink that streaked across the\
  \ sky. It was as if we were a part of the sunset itself, in its very heart. It was\
  \ emotional and caused me to glow with an overwhelming peace. All was right within\
  \ the world at that moment. It was completely magical and a fitting way to end what\
  \ was already a beautiful day."
