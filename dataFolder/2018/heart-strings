Text: "I wake up at 4:00 am, disoriented, and find myself crumpled into a ball, hugging\
  \ my ukulele case as the bus driver announces we are in Budapest. Stepping off the\
  \ hot overcrowded bus, the cold air is like a slap to the face, and the sun is just\
  \ beginning to break through the city skyline. My stomach rumbles loudly from a\
  \ mixture of hunger and nerves as I fumble my way through the city to Mexik\xF3\
  i \xFAt M, the designated pickup location, making a couple wrong turns along the\
  \ way and using up all my forints.\nI have 6 hours before boarding the Angoville\
  \ bus and teaching my first English class. Besides for the TEFL coursework, for\
  \ the past couple months I have been preparing for the week by learning several\
  \ easy children's songs in English on the ukulele. The food stores lining the subway\
  \ station are still closed and I have run out of forints anyway, so once I am at\
  \ Mexik\xF3i \xFAt M, I take out my ukulele and begin plucking to pass the time.\n\
  \"I see trees of green\nRed roses too\nI see-\"\nI here a cough near me, and look\
  \ up from my fretboard, nearly jumping from the steps, startled. A man is standing\
  \ right in front of me. He has long hair, dirty clothes, and a wide smile. I try\
  \ to motion to him that I have no money to give, and begin to back away, checking\
  \ the nearby exits of the subway. The man smiles and he begins speaking gently and\
  \ pointing at the instrument, but quickly realizes I am scared and cannot understand.\
  \ He hurries around the corner.\nMy heart is pounding as I quickly pack up my things,\
  \ clip on my backpack, and start heading to find people, when I see the man has\
  \ returned with a woman and a guitar. He smiles, sits on the steps where I had just\
  \ sat, and plays a fluttery riff that ends in bold, beautiful chords. As he begins\
  \ to sing in Hungarian, the woman points to my ukulele case, and I finally understand.\n\
  I briskly open up the case, sit by the man, and we figure out how the fluttery riff\
  \ translates to ukulele. Since I play guitar, I then learned the ukulele chords\
  \ by observing his hands. We began to play together, and it was as if our swirling\
  \ melodies echoing throughout station summoned the sun and the bustling city life\
  \ began. As the subway became busier, we explored playing other songs, and the woman\
  \ laid a hat in front of us.\nAs the time neared to my departure, they counted the\
  \ forints in the hat, and motioned to a nearby bakery. Before saying goodbye, we\
  \ all got a short breakfast together and, despite the language barrier, I had made\
  \ two new friends."
