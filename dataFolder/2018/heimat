Text: "\u201CYou shouldn\u2019t go there.\u201D I just can\u2019t recall how many\
  \ times they said that (in Spain, in France, in Germany) that I shouldn\u2019t visit\
  \ Poznan. \u201CI don\u2019t know, I just feel I should.\u201D \u201CWhy would you\
  \ go there? You don\u2019t know anybody there, nor the language.\u201D True. I had\
  \ no clue, however (given my contrary nature) I did. While on the bus I wondered:\
  \ \u201CThey did have a point.\u201D And in front of me, blurry, appeared the words:\
  \ \u2018unknown\u2019, \u2018dangerous\u2019, \u2018mortal\u2019, followed by the\
  \ syllogism \u201CAll men are mortal, he\u2019s one man, thus he\u2019s mortal.\u201D\
  \ \u201CAnyway, I\u2019m already here, so\u2026 for whatever comes.\u201D \n\nAt\
  \ the station, there she was, already waiting for me: Jola Banowska, the Polish\
  \ artist at whose studio I was to stay at. \u201CYou don\u2019t need to study a\
  \ whole degree in arts to learn the techniques, but you do need to have something\
  \ to say.\u201D I was to spend a week or two with her, having come to an end my\
  \ first trip around Europe. \n\n\u201CAnd, since you\u2019ve been travelling, I\u2019\
  d like you to focus on a theme, one word: Heimat.\u201D \n\nI knew the word from\
  \ my German classes, the difficulty to find an equivalent in Spanish: is it patria\
  \ (homeland)? Is it hogar (home)? \u201CHeimat und was ist Heimat f\xFCr dich.\u201D\
  \ (\u201CHeimat and what it is for you, what it means to you.\u201D) Wow! I was\
  \ really not expecting that at all. For a moment I tried to fill the concept with\
  \ one image: the silhouette of my country, my city, something sort of geographical\u2026\
  \ but I just came up with places (the Swiss Alps) and motifs (curtain tiebacks in\
  \ France, artificial flowers on graves in Spain) from Europe that had made me think\
  \ of my own family. \n\n\u201CWhat a theme, Jola!\u201D \n\nShe smiled with satisfaction,\
  \ knowing she had triggered something on me. \u201CWhat a way to finish this trip,\
  \ with such a question!\u201D (I thought to myself back then). But even more, (I\
  \ would say now) what a way to end up realising (though I couldn\u2019t admit it\
  \ at the moment) that in fact I didn\u2019t belong anywhere, that I could identify\
  \ myself as part of\u2026 everywhere? At the time, due to what I realised (those\
  \ motifs that made me feel at home), I just came up with the epithet \u2018Mother\
  \ Europe\u2019, but come to think of it, after all these years I think it happened\
  \ to me somehow what happened to Ivan Ilych: a whole life knowing the syllogism\
  \ (Yes, the same: \u201CAll men are mortal\u2026\u201D), but just till the end of\
  \ his days realising what it really meant: \u201C\u2026 he does not know more; he\
  \ knows deeper.\u201D So did I."
