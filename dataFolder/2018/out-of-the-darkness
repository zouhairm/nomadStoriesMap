Text: "When I first considered studying abroad in Copenhagen, one of the first things\
  \ to stand out to me was the peace and security enveloping the city, allowing for\
  \ a low crime rate and high personal safety. Realizing that I would be living on\
  \ my own in a foreign country for an entire semester required safety and security\
  \ as a major decision factor.\n\nHowever, this weekend\u2019s events have led me\
  \ to realize one should never rely on one\u2019s safety today. Within the blink\
  \ of an eye, anything can happen to destroy one\u2019s lasting confidence and security.\
  \ The terrorist attacks this weekend in Copenhagen were a shock and a tragedy to\
  \ all. How such evil and violence can penetrate and traumatize harmless people is\
  \ as infuriating as it is heartbreaking. My trust is the world is slowly fading.\
  \ To live in a safe and harmonious city is nonexistent. To evade fears and suspicions\
  \ of others is no longer noble and virtuous.\n\nThe events of the weekend coincide\
  \ with an exhibit I viewed today at the Aarhus Museum of Modern Art. The disturbing\
  \ yet famous exhibit, called \u201COut of the Darkness,\u201D poses this question:\
  \ How does one create meaning and understanding in a world lacking cohesion, a world\
  \ that is going through a dramatic process of change? The display attempts to overthrow\
  \ the safety, comprehension, and familiarity one has with the world, communicating\
  \ this as a thing of the past. It portrays art in a different way: art without structure,\
  \ without understanding, without harmony, ever seeking the impossible control and\
  \ comprehension. The exhibit leads us through a series of galleries, each unique,\
  \ but relating in a sense to the previous gallery. Through displays such as disturbing\
  \ statues, jarred dead horse parts, torture devises, and unsettling images, the\
  \ exhibit stirs up confusion, bewilderment, suspicion, and unease.\n\nIn the same\
  \ way today, many look at the world in hope or in despair. In many respects, our\
  \ age is defined by the fact that for the first time in the history of the world\
  \ we are standing in the face of a global challenge and a collective fate; a potential\
  \ abyss or a potential\_revival.\n\nEvery day is a choice. We can see the world\
  \ clouded in darkness, or in light. Tragedy and fear are inevitable, yet we can\
  \ only experience the light if we also experience the darkness. We cannot let these\
  \ tragedies alter our outlook on the world, and our journey through life. Let us\
  \ together keep pushing through, and take the path out of the darkness."
