Text: "Prepare yourself for the story about a little  girl who traveled alone to Japan.\
  \ The girl who was afraid of everything because It was her first flight, and first\
  \ trip alone. She didn\u2019t know their language and even the alphabet was kind\
  \ of dark magic. She needed to belong only to  herself. But you know what? She did\
  \ that!\nThat girl it\u2019s me. A small girl from Poland \u2013 from the middle\
  \ of Europe. Ready to do everything to make her dreams come true.\nThe trip was\
  \ amazing, including the 16 hours of flight. I lived with a host  family so I had\
  \ the biggest opportunity to see their daily routine  and to understand their culture\
  \ and behaviors. I\u2019ve never tried sushi or any other Japanese  food before\u2013\
  \ so I tasted the original one. And there is only one word for this \u2013 DE-LI-CIOUS.\
  \ The best thing was that my host mother didn\u2019t speak English, so I needed\
  \ to trust her what is on my plate. The only thing that I could recognize it was\
  \ rice. Rice, rice everywhere, every day. Eating and watching their rituals, the\
  \ kids behaviors and wondering how amazing it is to be part of this. Observing them\
  \ every day surprised  me with  something different. You see that European and Asian\
  \ cultures are totally distinct.     \nThis moment when you understand completely\
  \ nothing and you are trying to ask about the way a person who doesn\u2019t speak\
  \ English . It\u2019s the moment when you realize that hands are very useful during\
  \ the communication .  I needed to believe that \u201EWho enquire doesn\u2019t get\
  \ lost\u201D. But honestly ,  It is so hard to ask about anything when you know\
  \ two words in their language. \nWhen you travel alone you can be proud of yourself\
  \ even in the simplest things. Like for example \u201EYeeey I caugh t  the right\
  \ train\u201D or \u201EI\u2019ve bought the ticket \u201D.   \nEven in the toughest\
  \ moments,  you are trying to look for the bright sides. Even in the crowded train\
  \ when you can\u2019t almost breathe. You know what is the bright side of this situation?\
  \ That the Japanese  don\u2019t sweat.  \nTravelling alone perfectly shows weaknesses\
  \ , faith in  yourself and who you really are in the stressed situations. You can\u2019\
  t pretend a different person that you really are. It\u2019s the moment when you\
  \ can\u2019t lie. When you put everything in adventure and experience of something\
  \ new. \nIt\u2019s the moment when you realize that everything is different than\
  \  you saw on  Internet or TV. That plans are totally backgrounded . First You have\
  \ to see to understand and to find out about the real appearance  of the place where\
  \ you are."
