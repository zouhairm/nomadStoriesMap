Text: "God created a beautiful world but much of its beauty has been ruined by humans.\
  \ So, I left my home and embarked on a solo trip to feel the enchanting nature in\
  \ the mountains of Sikkim. \nFrom the plains of Siliguri, the warm temperature slowly\
  \ changed into breezy cold air and I gained altitude. My only companion as well\
  \ as driver,Pema,was a short fellow of Sikkimese origin. Like most I initially kept\
  \ to myself; a tentative tour plan in my head and an open eye to enjoy the scenes\
  \ en route. Pema was constantly trying to get at ease with me which I felt a little\
  \ weird. But by the end of the first day we started to chat more. With the uncertainty\
  \ of getting good weather at higher places I was a bit dubious, but he kept me on\
  \ the high hopes with his optimism. The next day I continued from Gangtok, where\
  \ I had a nice sleep, to Lachen. The road was tough and my heart skipped a beat\
  \ at sharp turns. Lachen was my stopover; a village with only about four to five\
  \ wooden houses and the gushing sound of Teesta river as it flowed down fiercely.\
  \ I was tired of the day\u2019s journey and the he came to me and took me to a local\
  \ gathering. It was a small festival of some kind and Pema introduced me to the\
  \ people over there. Within moments I felt a bonding with the locals and started\
  \ enjoying. I was offered a local drink called Tongba, which I would not have tasted\
  \ if not for Pema. Later I dozed off and with the sunrise I left for Gurudongmar\
  \ lake;  a fresh water lake, 17,800 feet high above sea level. This time I felt\
  \ a stronger connection with Pema. He has become a friend; a person who was moulding\
  \ my tour plans and leaving me with more surprising experiences. As we reached Gurudongmar\
  \ Lake I felt the air to be thin and it become tough to breathe. Unsure of how long\
  \ I could enjoy the views, I stood quiet with a dizzy head. But soon he came beside\
  \ me and amplified me with confidence. Within minutes I was walking with him along\
  \ the edge of the lake to the other end; a place where nature is all you have. I\
  \ saw wild deer and a giant glacier which, maybe most people does not know that\
  \ it exists there. The sights were just beautiful; maybe I am lacking words to describe,\
  \ something beyond my expectations. \nAs we headed back my closeness grew with him.\
  \ When I look back, this tour feels a touch more memorable. Maybe it was for my\
  \ new friend, Pema.  After all he was the one who showed me Sikkim differently;\
  \ exploring and getting to know more about the land and the culture it has within."
