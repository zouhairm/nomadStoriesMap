Text: "If you\u2019re ever worried about solo traveling or are just nervous about\
  \ visiting a new country, try making a local connection *before* you get there.\
  \  I am an authority on this subject because several years ago I got the itch to\
  \ go to Costa Rica.  The idea of visiting rain forests, beaches, volcanoes, and\
  \ natural hot springs beckoned.   But, I was a single mom of a 6 year-old boy that\
  \ had a huge sense of adventure, but was at a total loss with how to make the trip\
  \ happen.\n\nI started to mention the trip idea to friends and colleagues to see\
  \ if anyone knew about Costa Rica.  I hit the jackpot when a friend said she knew\
  \ someone who was actually from Costa Rica.  I dropped any sense of shyness and\
  \ reached out.  It was the best thing.\n\nI soon met up with Amanda who was very\
  \ excited to tell me all about going to Costa Rica, filled me in on Tico culture,\
  \ customs, and sayings.  I had a crash course on the Pura Vida lifestyle, which\
  \ terrain to avoid, what to do, and what not to do.\n\nBefore the end of lunch,\
  \ I already had a full itinerary complete with practical tips (like take mosquito\
  \ spray with a high concentration of Deet and make sure your rental car has 4 wheel\
  \ drive).  I imagined myself already at the Tercolis bridge overlooking crocodiles\
  \ and iguanas.  I easily pictured myself at the Villa Caletas Hotel catching the\
  \ sunset over a drink.   I walked away with phone numbers of local taxi drivers\
  \ and some of Amanda's family members that owned a canopy adventure company.\n\n\
  I also found out the best places for seeing specific types of monkeys down at the\
  \ Manuel Antonio National Park.  Amanda also went into good detail about places\
  \ like Quepos and provided me more local contacts at Jaco Beach.\n\nI gained so\
  \ much travel confidence just by making a local connection before ever leaving California.\
  \  In the end, I incorporated many of Amanda's recommendations into my actual trip.\
  \  I still had room to add other adventures.  In the end, we went ziplining, saw\
  \ a variety of rainforest birds and animals, went to a butterfly farm, played at\
  \ different beaches, hiked up to volcanoes, and had the adventure of a lifetime.\
  \  Throughout my travels, my first trip to Costa Rica remains a great memory and\
  \ it was all thanks to my willingness to make a local connection."
