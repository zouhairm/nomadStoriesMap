Text: "\u201CBeautiful, isn\u2019t he?\u201D Her strong accent filled my ears and\
  \ my thoughts were interrupted while soft fur slowly glided in between my fingers.\
  \ \u201CToo bad his days are counted.\u201D \n\nA disease, perhaps. Or maybe age.\
  \ My naivety would never allow me to fully grasp the ugly truth. Still innocently\
  \ sipping a much-needed cold beverage, my eyes drifted from black and white coat\
  \ to meet the stare of the old lady who caught my attention. \u201COh, I\u2019m\
  \ sorry. I didn\u2019t mean to intrude. Is he yours?\u201D \n\nSharp green eyes\
  \ closed for a second while purring loudly, clearly enjoying the attention. \u201C\
  Oh, no, no, I don\u2019t own animals. Especially cats. They\u2019re like a plague\
  \ here in Greece. Only here for the tourists.\u201D \n\nI still couldn\u2019t quite\
  \ understand the concept, or why someone would think bad of such elegant creatures.\
  \ The lady, however, clearly unfazed by my wandering mind added, \u201Cand when\
  \ the season is over, so are they.\u201D \n\nThe thought made my blood run cold.\
  \ What did she mean by that? Surely, there should be institutions and charities\
  \ taking care of those poor souls \u201CExcuse me?\u201D \n\n\u201COh, you know.\
  \ The tourists feed the cats. Once summer is over, they starve, and some are just\
  \ poisoned to avoid the problem altogether. I don\u2019t agree with this particularly,\
  \ but there isn\u2019t much to do when the island is empty. Maybe a quick death\
  \ isn\u2019t so bad after all.\u201D \n\nThe lady didn't see my face go sour, nor\
  \ my sudden lack of appetite. Pushing my dish aside, pointed nails punctured my\
  \ skin while the wildcat crawled onto my lap. Startled by the abrupt movement, I\
  \ froze, while the cat, with no regards whatsoever, happily started to eat from\
  \ my abandoned plate. I caressed his ears, still adjusting to the new weight. The\
  \ creature was clueless about his future, and my heart sank upon realizing this\
  \ could be one of his last meals. \n\nGreece was one of my long-dreamed holiday\
  \ destinations, one that I had planned visiting for so long. Yet, I couldn't even\
  \ begin to imagine the reality of these animals. Cats, like other unseen animals\
  \ around the world, were not a priority. Hopelessly, I tried the best to accommodate\
  \ the now satisfied soul on my arms. For a wild creature, he was very trusting,\
  \ which made me sadder. Those who wanted to harm him probably would. \n\nAfter an\
  \ overbooked, delayed flight,  I finally arrived in Germany, twenty-four hours late.\
  \ Stuttgart was colder than Rhodes, and I could feel him shaking inside the cradle.\
  \ \"Shhh, baby boy, it's over now. You're finally home.\" And this is how I got\
  \ my most precious souvenir of all."
