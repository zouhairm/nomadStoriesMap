Text: "Incessant winds blew coarse grit onto the delivery room counters and tools.\
  \ Faded tables with orange, dirt-stained creases were the best any hospital had\
  \ to offer. I scrubbed each of the two available tables with whatever scraps of\
  \ clean fabric I could find. Equipment was sanitized by bleach or boiling water.\
  \ As I was finishing my daily cleaning, a swollen skeleton stumbled into the delivery\
  \ center. She was ready, or thought she was ready. I watched the midwife check her\
  \ pulse. Good. Dilation? Good. Minutes of moaning turned to hours. Finally, a tiny\
  \ foot poked out. The pallid blue skin starkly contrasted the light pink table.\
  \ Then, all at once, the baby came. The umbilical cord was wrapped around her neck,\
  \ her mouth open in a silent scream. Without hesitation the midwife grabbed one\
  \ of the small, filthy cleaning towels, wrapped the baby, and handed her to me \u2013\
  \ dead.\n\nIn Africa, death is second nature. Before volunteering I knew the statistics,\
  \ but I had no experience with their meaning. Now death faced me. Walking down the\
  \ road greeting street kids gives no solace when you know they will be dead in a\
  \ few weeks. Still, I could see from their emaciated faces that they appreciated\
  \ my compassion.\n\nI encountered these same expressionless faces everywhere I turned.\
  \ A year later, while working in a refugee camp, they peered up at me again. However,\
  \ this time they were the result of a different medical disparity.\n\n\u201CSabah\
  \ alkhyr, Jamilla.\u201D Dr. Zyoud poured the last drops of morning coffee into\
  \ a small paper cup. His kind eyes were bloodshot, his forehead wrinkled with worry.\
  \ Dust blew through the open windows; solid glass was a luxury too expensive for\
  \ this hospital.\n\n\u201CSabah alkhyr, Dr. Zyoud,\u201D I felt ashamed for my well-rested\
  \ body. \u201CWorking the night shift again?\u201D\n\n\u201CEvery day, Jamilla.\
  \ If I don\u2019t, no one will.\u201D\n\nCrowding in refugee camps causes disease\
  \ and depression to spread almost instantly. The high demand for doctors creates\
  \ a starved healthcare system where each doctor is required to work many hours each\
  \ week between multiple facilities. Hospitals are mere blocks apart, yet the equipment\
  \ and cleanliness separate them by decades. Poverty keeps many from proper healthcare.\
  \ The doctors do their best, but inferior conditions are often to blame."
