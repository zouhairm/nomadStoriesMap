Text: "\"I want you to meet my spiritual family in Wadi Rumm\", said by Arab archaeologist\
  \ with big brown eyes and a compelling grin. Meeting Narzi at the entrance to Petra,\
  \ I am enchanted by his idea that we know each other from past-lives. Born in one\
  \ of Petra's caves he is driven to find the origins of the rose-red-city. \nIt's\
  \ 1994, I am 40, travelling alone, blonded by Australian sun. Female. Jordan has\
  \ only recently opened its borders to Western tourists. However after a week I meet\
  \ another backpacker who says yes to the trip into Wadi Rumm.\nI hire a jeep in\
  \ Aqaba and Narzi drives like a zealot through the desert, on an invisible road.\
  \ We stall in unbelievably beautiful tangerine sand-drifts, and I lie spreadeagled\
  \ under the blue while the boys dig out the jeep. \nAfter two hours we meet a lone\
  \ shepherdess with goats. But Narzi stays at a distance, I guess, is respectful\
  \ for lone Bedouin women. She makes coffee on a tamarisk-stick fire, but her smile\
  \ is cool. When she rubs her two index-fingers together, suggesting friction, glancing\
  \ at Narzi: 'Man! She means body-friction', I remember that women don't travel alone\
  \ in an Islamic culture.\nSkidding into an amphitheatre of sheer purple cliffs the\
  \ camp is revealed at dusk. Two hand-woven goat-hair tents are black-marks clouded\
  \ by mauve- smoke.\nWadi Rumm, Valley of the Moon, illuminated by a full moon that\
  \ first night as Narzi tries to convince me of our destiny as a tryst with the gods.\
  \ Fortunately, he is gone the next day and I wander in the sublime desert with a\
  \ young daughter of the family, embalmed in silence, farting goats, and the trill\
  \ of a thin tin-pipe. Same, day after day, until a member of the family attempts\
  \ to sell me to his friend for three camels: \"Go with him, now! You are his woman.\"\
  \ A moment so bizarre, I walk out of the tent into the desert night. My friend,\
  \ Forrest, has ridden out of camp on a camel a few days before. He is making a lone\
  \ trek to Ethiopia.\nOffered sizzling goat-eyes from a fire - a goat slaughted and\
  \ its blood oozing into the sand at my feet is challenging, but it's Jebel Rumm's\
  \ towers that mark each day as sublime. At 1734 metres high its shades of purple,\
  \ pink, and indigo ask for homage. I read about T.E Lawrence's mad love for his\
  \ Arab Corps when he visited this area during the 1917-18 war. \nWhen the family's\
  \ matriarch, Rhianne, dropped her head to the sand repeatedly on her prayer mat\
  \ at dawn, I am stilled by reverence for people who have been disposed from their\
  \ land."
