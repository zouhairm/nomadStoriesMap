Text: "Grappling with the paraphernalia, I skid down the dunes bordering Bana, a small\
  \ village in Rajasthan, India. The team catches up, breathless. Perks of a trainee\
  \ archaeologist, eh?\nI see the elders resting on jute beds while kids play by the\
  \ canopies of small adobe blocks. On noticing us, they come running, curious about\
  \ our gadgets. In the huddle, there\u2019s a kid with a sprightly demeanour. Deva.\
  \ An eight year-old who can\u2019t take his eyes off a miniature Mickey Mouse badge\
  \ on my backpack. I take it out and pin it to his shirt. Beaming with joy, he asks,\
  \ \u201CWant to see something?\u201D I nod and follow.\nFive minutes and we\u2019\
  re at an oasis. Calm water, date palms and flowering cacti. Ordinary yet sublime.\n\
  \u201CTell you a secret?\u201D\n\u201CGo ahead, kid.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s a magic\
  \ pond. Long back, when my mother went away, father brought me here with her golden\
  \ necklace I loved. He threw it in the water and cried. Didn\u2019t know why he\
  \ did that, but, it made him feel better, stronger. I come here whenever I have\
  \ a wish. And, it works! You try!\u201D Smiling at him, I close my eyes. Then, it\
  \ hits. I glance around. This is the Oasis- site for the ancient Baror civilization.\
  \ The site for the excavation. By day after, what I see now, wouldn\u2019t even\
  \ exist! Deva\u2019s magic pond!\n\u201CDeva, remember what the necklace looked\
  \ like?\u201D\n\u201CNo, but it\u2019s golden.\u201D Perfect, I think.\n\u201CWant\
  \ to find it? You can keep it with you, forever, you know!\u201D\n\u201COkay, but,\
  \ I don\u2019t know how to swim.\u201D\n\u201CI can help you get it!\u201D\n\u201C\
  Can you?\u201D, he asks in wonder.\n\u201CYes!\u201D\nI take off my boots and safa,\
  \ the traditional Rajasthani turban. The scarf around the neck stays.\nWater\u2019\
  s warm and comforting. Lucid aquamarine. Diving in, I search amid the glinting liquid.\
  \ Suddenly, my hand catches hold of a metallic string. Reaching the surface, I shout,\
  \ \u201CLook what I found, Deva!\u201D Awestruck, he grabs the necklace. \u201C\
  This is it!\u201D, he exclaims. \u201CIt\u2019s hers. It\u2019s my mum\u2019s.\u201D\
  \ He hugs me tight as I scratch his elfin head. A happy dance ensues. \u201CSee!\
  \ I told you we\u2019d find it, it\u2019s your mum\u2019s, we had to find it!\u201D\
  \nKeeping it close and planting a few kisses on it, he says in a tiny voice, \u201C\
  Never letting go of this, not telling dad, he\u2019d toss it again somewhere.\u201D\
  \ \u201CNever do\u201D, I chuckled.\nA week passes. Deva, even happier, has a part\
  \ of his mum to watch over, closer. As I board the bus, leaving behind the old desert,\
  \ I smile. We\u2019re heading homewards, the other corner of India- Mumbai. I meet\
  \ Mother in two days; would she notice my bare neck? I\u2019m too happy to bother\
  \ about it anyway."
