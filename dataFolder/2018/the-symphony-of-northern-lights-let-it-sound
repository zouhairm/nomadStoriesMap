Text: "No matter how we live - we always want to catch our happiness. Wherever we\
  \ go traveling, we always want the same during our journey... \n\nWhere is my home?\
  \ Apartment, hall and kitchen? Maybe it is a meadow, where I play like a princess.\
  \ Everywhere is homelike. Or maybe somewhere is it not so homelike?\n\nReader is\
  \ an observer! Are you here? Do you see these drops of delight of our dear universe,\
  \ which are given to us by simplicity of life? Simplicity or greatness?\n\nCan it\
  \ be true that someone can settle for a night's lodging in the open and for a meal\
  \ not from restaurant's menu, but from a chance event? A lot can happen on the way...\n\
  \nToday only a total ascetic who travelled in the mountains of Caucasus, searching\
  \ for ancient mystical constructions - dolmens, can allow himself, to at least slightly\
  \ unveil the  view of the world.\n \nI just thought that no one of us thinks about\
  \ the world. But what do we know about it, besides consumption?\nI stop, the Symphony\
  \ of Northern Lights (or SNL) starts to sound clearly in my mind.\n\nI am happy\
  \ for this world like a child and for the first time in my life I decide to start\
  \ winter hitch-hiking through Russia, in Murmansk city, in order to see how the\
  \ nature's power plays SNL.\n\nI go towards the New Year. How? How didn't I freeze\
  \ during my travel and where did I stay overnight without money, where did I eat\
  \ all these 5 days traveling with casual cars on my way to the SNL? \_\n\nWhere\
  \ did I celebrate and meet 2018? There are no enough signs to describe it. I can\
  \ describe it so colorfully, that your stomach will start to salivate and your thoughts\
  \ will become twisted in a tornado. \n\nI can talk about people who can warm you\
  \ up with their souls, so delicate and with tremor that you will start to feel it\
  \ in your heart.\n\nI can continue for everyone and about everything with interest,\
  \ truthful and profound but what about rules of the contest?\n\nEverything is common\
  \ in this life - both small things and big things, when you are open-minded to the\
  \ world around you.The more tight is your connection with this world and everything\
  \ what is inside this universe, the higher is your level of perception.This is how\
  \ my happiness and, I hope yours too, worries about us. \_Reader is observer!\n\
  This is the direct relation, ladies and gentlemen! The End.\n\nP.S. The SNL is ringing\
  \ inside me now. Because I didn't see it in Murmansk. Global warming\u2026 This\
  \ is a real story of humanity with continuance."
