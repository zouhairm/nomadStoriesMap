Text: "Here I was, in a small Italian village called \u201CSanta Maria Rezzonico\u201D\
  . I had found this place online while looking for a weekly market. Well, I must\
  \ have done something wrong because this \u201Cvillagio\u201D was literally empty.\
  \ Instead of hearing the chippering sound of the passionate Italian language, a\
  \ silence lingered in the hot air. As I strolled around, looking for just one actual\
  \ person, I started to feel being watched. At first, I couldn\u2019t get a proper\
  \ grasp of who or what it was, but then I saw their \u201Ceyes\u201D: Heaps of door\
  \ knots staring at me. It didn\u2019t feel creepy, though. Their presence had a\
  \ magical attraction: These doors made me wonder about the secret that was lying\
  \ behind them. Their antique look was just the prolog of said mysterious story.\n\
  \n\u201CCiao, ragazza,\u201D one said. \u201CIf you have any questions, just ask\
  \ me. I\u2019ve been around for some time.\u201D Indeed! The grey paint was already\
  \ coming off. The scratches on the surface reminded me of the wrinkles on the faces\
  \ of the elderly. It made me think: When people\u2019s lives leave a visual footprint\
  \ on this earth, beauty is present. When their experiences, struggles, and happiness\
  \ become visual, their very existence is an artistic masterpiece in itself. \u201C\
  Come, sit with me,\u201D the door invited me. It sounded like my granny, and I instantly\
  \ sat down on its lap. Sitting there I realized how intertwined the past and present\
  \ are. Resting cross-legged on the doorstep, I connected with every person who had\
  \ ever walked through this grey wooden door.\n\n\u201CYou know I haven\u2019t come\
  \ around much,\u201D the door said. \u201CI am sorry to hear that,\u201D I replied\
  \ as my own wanderlust immediately felt the deepest sympathy. \u201COh, don\u2019\
  t be! I may not have traveled but I am not who I used to be either.\u201D This door\
  \ made a great point! Only because something is immobile doesn\u2019t mean it is\
  \ unchangeable. The door probably looked the same as ever. However, the pretty mobiles\
  \ vines growing up the fa\xE7ade changed the entire reality of the immobile door.\
  \ Hence, even if we believe to be stuck, our lives can still alter. Ultimately,\
  \ this means: My fixed and unmodifiable past does not have to determine my present\
  \ or future.\n\n\u201CYou are boring,\u201D the door said. \u201CExcuse me?\u201D\
  \ I replied. Apparently, this cranky old thing had expected more excitement from\
  \ a traveler than my pensive silence. \u201CCome on, let\u2019s take a picture together,\u201D\
  \ I heard myself say. And I swear, if its door knots had not been so rusty, I would\
  \ have heard the door rolling with its eyes, \"Today's youth!\""
