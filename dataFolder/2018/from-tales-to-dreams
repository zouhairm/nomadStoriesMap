Text: "Looking down as the sun bathes the fields that stretch between the Dragon Gate\
  \ and the country he swore to protect, the 18th century Portuguese leader Count\
  \ of Lippe never imagined that, nearly 300 years later, would be himself to tell\
  \ this story to the tourists flashing their smartphones at the QR Codes strategically\
  \ inserted in the ash stoned walls of  Gra\xE7a (Grace) fortification. Impetuously\
  \ rising on top of a steep slope and rocky outcrops that unnerved even the bravest\
  \ Spanish invaders during the War of the Oranges, the garrison town of Elvas is\
  \ the largest bulwarked dry-ditch system in the world, and one of the 15 Portuguese\
  \ World Heritage by UNESCO. Rui Jesu\xEDno, the town\xB4s historian, impersonates\
  \ one of the several historical figures that could, in the future, explain us how\
  \ exactly the Fort was tight-proofed from unwanted wonderers. \"Anyone daring to\
  \ enter through the Dragon Gate, with the intention of invading it, hardly touched\
  \ the door. First, a jet of boiling water that was thrown through a hole purposely\
  \ made in the middle of the dome, the spears firing from the perforations along\
  \ the arcade, culminating with the hidden cannon in a large cavity in the ceiling,\
  \ throwing boulders at anyone who could get there\". Gasping at their deadly faith,\
  \ we gather on the terrace of the Governor\xB4s House, the highest point of the\
  \ Fort, accessed by a narrow and circular staircase that still maintains its original\
  \ wood and is therefore quite fragile. \u201CWe could even offer you the opportunity\
  \ to take pictures with characters such as Marques de Pombal, or Count Lippe himself\u201D\
  \ the historian reveals, glazing at the breathtaking panoramic view over the picturesque\
  \ town. Leaving the wars behind, we take coverage under the scars shadow provided\
  \ by a large olive tree in the historical center, along a big imperial ice cold\
  \ beer, the only way one survives the 40\xBACelsius of the Alentejo summer. Nearby,\
  \ an old lady in colorful attire sings the story of Gil Fernandes, the young knight\
  \ who faced the Spanish invaders to prove himself worthy of the princess but tragically\
  \ died by their swords after the king refused to open the gates upon his return.\
  \ With a name borrowed from the patroness of the Fort we just visited, the lady\
  \ assured that he was immortalized as the brave Knight of Elvas. With closed eyes,\
  \ I wonder if he is also one of the historic figures Mr Jesu\xEDno mentioned, and\
  \ if I could just scan a QR Code with my iPhone and listen to him unburden his tragic\
  \ love story."
