Text: "I awoke in a van surrounded by swollen, wet faces full of concern, staring\
  \ down at me. \u201CWhat happened?\u201D I croaked, confused. \n\u201CYou passed\
  \ out. Hypothermic shock,\u201D one bystander answered. \u201CYou are safe now.\u201D\
  \nIt was only hours early I had been driving through the sinuous roads of Iceland\u2019\
  s southern region, the thick, luxuriant mountains enveloped the landscape ahead\
  \ of me. My travel companions and I were full of excitement for the next adventure\
  \ on our Icelandic Bucket List. Silfra.\nWe arrived at our destination to a friendly\
  \ handshake from Carlos, our guide for the next hour. Carlos was a 26 year old Spanish\
  \ university-drop out, who came to Iceland under the intention of staying for only\
  \ a few weeks. That was four years ago. \u201CAlright everyone,\u201D Carlos sang\
  \ out of his snorkel gear, \u201Ctime to get wet!\u201D \nWe dressed in our dry\
  \ suits, and specialised snorkel gear, waddled in our laughably large flippers and\
  \ prepared for the coldness ahead.\nSilfra is the only place in the world where\
  \ one can snorkel in between the crack of two continental plates, and contains the\
  \ clearest, glacial water in the world, which at this time was about 2 degrees celsius.\
  \ This was something of little concern, yet was a decision that pushed me to the\
  \ edge.  \nUpon entering, within seconds, my hands, feet and face went numb, with\
  \ the rest of my body cold yet protected from the dry suit. But it was only a fleeting\
  \ thought compared to the sights that embraced the group.\nThe clarity of water\
  \ was unimaginable, as if looking into air. Small, beige fish swam around my legs\
  \ as I floated along, the strong currents guiding all our bodies through the meandering\
  \ maze of melted glacial water. All of us were mesmerised by the amalgamation of\
  \ colours underneath the surface; differing blues, browns and greens dominated my\
  \ vision, as I bumped into rocks and blunt coral along the water\u2019s edge. Remembering\
  \ what Carlos had recommended earlier, I removed my snorkel and took a large gulp\
  \ of my surroundings. It was no different to sipping from a glass of icy water at\
  \ home; fresh, clean and cool. \nFor 45 minutes we continued in this way, taking\
  \ in the enthralling sights beneath, finally exiting at a small metal ladder near\
  \ a wooden wharf. This was when the confusion hit, my mind began to wander, my heart\
  \ rate slowed and an immense pain overcame my body as others around me chatted,\
  \ unaware of my decline. Darkness hit and I awoke in the van surrounded by swollen,\
  \ wet faces. \n\u201CHypothermic shock. You are safe now.\u201D"
