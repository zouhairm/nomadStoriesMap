Text: "Turtuk:  The slice of Humanity between Two warring Nations.\nImagine One Fine\
  \ morning you woke up to find that overnight your Nationality changed nations? Would\
  \ you Flight or Fight. Maulvi Abdullah Karmapa, played a decisive role that morning\
  \ & extoled the villagers of Turtuk to stay& decide for a decent family life. \n\
  Settlement with India was chosen by the awakened Turtuk Villagers on the morning\
  \ of 14th Dec 1971.\nWe manipulated in the barren hills  besides nearly 200+km road\
  \ from the Leh district. The decision to travel onwards from Nubhra valley to this\
  \ village led to treacherous winding roads, falling rocks and getting close to Pakistan\
  \ and China.Finally the legendary and the only connection, The Wooden Bridge over\
  \ the furiously flowing River Shyok (means River of death) was in front of us. \n\
  \  Earlier some people were involved in blowing up this bridge. They were exposed\
  \ and later forgiven by the Indian army. This won the hearts for ever. Indian troops\
  \ won back Turtuk and three more villages \u2013 Dhothang, Tyakshi (earlier called\
  \ Tiaqsi) and Chalunkha \u2013 from the Pakistani territory, 23 years after it had\
  \ gone  to Pakistan.\n\u201CWhy did they not capture the whole area\u201D? Asked\
  \ one old man in the village.The sudden accession of  just few villages from the\
  \ Baltistan, brought  pain for hordes of families & paid a heavy price for the enmity\
  \ of two nations. An invisible wall rose that night and many perished under its\
  \ shadow. The marriages got split across the LOC. Turtuk has moved on since 1971.\
  \ Even though the streets seem to be as narrow  social stratifcation in terms of\
  \ House quality can be seen, even though people seem to be happy lot\nTurtuk has\
  \ a Caf\xE9 too for its curious & tired travellers. Hot  noodles besides the local\
  \ Buck Wheat based dishes were available for guests. The serenity of the surrounds\
  \ seemed to have the lasting impression on the local people.\nThe best part of the\
  \ visit was meeting Faisal Khan alumni of Delhi University, trying to learn Guitar.\
  \ He is the future star as he says confidently. The village is a unique combination\
  \ of  co existing Muslims and a few Buddhist families, an old Monastery, Mustard\
  \ & Wheat fields, green vegetables, gigantic mint plants, chirpy young urchins,\
  \ and very serious looking young girls, so eager to know about Delhi & India.\n\
  \ Small gifts like Diaries, Pencils, fancy  colour pens for these  curious kids,\
  \ with  stars in their eyes would have done the trick.We all hope sincerely that\
  \ Turtuk  continues to prosper."
