Text: "Wandering through Old Havana, it seems everything is broken. People are constantly\
  \ bartering for parts: car seats, tires, steering wheels, mattresses. I meet him\
  \ by chance during a Sunday morning walk. Busy maneuvering an indistinct tool, he\
  \ looks up and I say, \"Buenos d\xEDas.\"  He replies, \"Buenos d\xEDas\" and cocks\
  \ his head, his attention mostly on his project but also on me. \n \nHe is perched\
  \ on a step with what I now see is a wrench in his hand and a motorcycle tire squeezed\
  \ between his legs. He is disheveled. His short-sleeve navy dress shirt tattered,\
  \ with patches of dirt; his khaki pants are baggy and stained; his loafers, aged,\
  \ the soles thin and discolored from wear.\n \nWe chat in Spanish. I comment on\
  \ his baseball cap. \"Have you been to Arizona?\" He answers my question with a\
  \ question. \"\xBFEres americano?\" I respond, \"Yes, I am American.\" He drops\
  \ his wrench and tire and flashes a wide smile. Everything on his face illuminates\
  \ including his brilliant hazel eyes. He stands up and shakes my hand.  He is Tom\xE1\
  s. I am Kelly.\n \n\"\xBFTe gusta la m\xFAsica?\" Tom\xE1s asks. He is speaking\
  \ fast and I struggle to follow. He shouts, \"Glenn Miller\" and \"Nat King Cole.\"\
  \ I reply, \"Yes!\" He moves to his feet and motions toward the door.  I'm not sure\
  \ what to say or do. The door is ajar but I dare not follow.\n\nTom\xE1s has a guitar\
  \ in hand. Unlike the recycled parts I have seen in Cuba, his guitar is in great\
  \ condition. He strums the strings and says, \"Glenn Miller,\" and plays \"In the\
  \ Mood.\" The frail man I encountered minutes ago has transformed into an energetic\
  \ stage performer.\n \nI ask Tom\xE1s if I can take his picture. As if I am a photographer\
  \ and Tom\xE1s my model, he poses with his treasure.  He turns his head left, then\
  \ right, repositioning the guitar as he moves his hands cautiously down the spine\
  \ of its body.\n \nTom\xE1s is 73 years old. His country is poor; at least that's\
  \ what he wants me to know.  He loves the United States and cups his hand over his\
  \ mouth when he talks about his government, touching my hand gently, in a fatherly\
  \ way to make sure I understand.\n \nI explain to Tom\xE1s that I must go and he\
  \ ducks inside. I stay. He presents me with two business cards: Tom\xE1s Guitarrista,\
  \ Cantante y Bailarin, Professor de Guitarra. I am grinning from ear to ear. He\
  \ is a singer, dancer and teacher. Tom\xE1s asks me to send him copies of the pictures\
  \ and we embrace. He kisses me on the cheek goodbye. I often reflect on our time\
  \ together and wonder if he received the photos."
