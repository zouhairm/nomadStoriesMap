Text: "The world is huge. And you don\u2019t realize just how small of a space you\
  \ take up until you leave what you know to explore what\u2019s out there. I had\
  \ this revelation when I traveled to Sydney, Australia to be an au pair. Being a\
  \ live in nanny was not something I always dreamed about, but going to Australia\
  \ was. As a college student with a small budget, I figured this would be the best\
  \ way for me to make my dream a reality. I spent three months living with a loving\
  \ and welcoming family on Sydney\u2019s north side. \nBefore my trip, I didn\u2019\
  t really know what to expect. Movies and the media told me to be prepared for crocodiles,\
  \ spiders that can eat you, and lots of sunshine. The first few weeks of my adventure\
  \ were mostly about finding all of the differences between the midwest farm fields\
  \ of America and New South Wales suburban life. I marveled at how the English language\
  \ could be spoken in such a different way with so many abbreviated words! I also\
  \ noticed the obvious differences of driving on the other side of the road and the\
  \ countries love for tea time and tim tams. \nAfter the initial culture shock wore\
  \ off, I could concentrate on all of the similarities I found between my life growing\
  \ up and the daily life of the kids I was looking after. Living with a family made\
  \ it effortless to create a local connection. I knew all the moms at tennis camp\
  \ and I babysat for a few families in the neighborhood. I was fully submerged in\
  \ family life (which was a big contrast to the university life I was used to). I\
  \ felt a part of their community. \nIf I had to describe the vibe of Sydney and\
  \ its people in one word, it would be \u201Cchill.\u201D Even though I was near\
  \ the city, nothing was fast paced. I loved passing by Bondi beach right as work\
  \ got out to see everyone rush to put their surfboards in the water. Walking through\
  \ the botanic gardens at lunch time was like one giant picnic. When I traveled up\
  \ the coast to smaller beach towns the locals were even more chill. The laid back\
  \ beach life vibe caught on to everyone passing by. It made it impossible for you\
  \ to be stressed out or worried. One of my favorite Australian terms that I brought\
  \ back with me is, \u201Cno worries, mate.\u201D\nNow that I realize just how big\
  \ the world is, I can't help wondering about all cultures of the world. I want to\
  \ experience the small details of daily life and see what makes communities so different.\
  \ But more importantly, I want to see what makes them all similar."
