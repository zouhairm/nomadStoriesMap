Text: "The cold saturates the skin off its moisture. A gruelling journey of 72 km\
  \ on a terrain not kind to mankind with harsh temperatures ranging from \u2013 30\
  \ degree to \u2013 40 degree, all to be done solo. My fingers have been anaesthetized\
  \ from the cold dosage of breeze for I have lost my gloves from past two days and\
  \ continue my journey forward. My shoe string budget suspended my feet at the hands\
  \ of cold as the second hand gum boots was the only option I could have afforded\
  \ to attempt my trek on Chadar.  This cold comfort for change gave me a chance to\
  \ experience the feel of a local\u2019s feet walking on the frozen Chadar with no\
  \ insulation boots. There are constant spaces where the river still gushes down\
  \ its path with turquoise blue water casting spells of stare for the eyes that look\
  \ at it. The wind often roars to break the monotony of silence and patrols the frozen\
  \ river as I stare deep into the cold waters for a while. Get wet and you are as\
  \ good as dead. But, what would it feel to be naked of all the clothing, of all\
  \ the alluring desires and immerse your-self completely likes a suspended animation\
  \ attached to a string of faith and hope? Sometimes, fairy tales frighten the child\
  \ within you with all the fears and doubts surrounding but it is necessary for every\
  \ human to not only be strong but to feel strong. I chose to go with my inner calling\
  \ of tasting the turquoise blue water. The cold starts to grip my body as I begin\
  \ to loose myself and slowly surrender to the pinching cold to trick my mind. My\
  \ feet growing numb, I begin to take deep breaths and reaffirm my belief in the\
  \ spiritual energies and jumps into the river chanting: Om Namah Shivaye. Within\
  \ fraction of seconds into the water, my senses begin to loose their sensing ability\
  \ as I quickly place my legs firm enough to gain a fortunate grip lasting for substantial\
  \ seconds. This position put me right at the bottom, giving my body the narrow chance\
  \ to take three dips one after the other. The state of mind was transcendental to\
  \ thoughtlessness and I was embraced in a zone of nothingness. The whole body was\
  \ soon a dead weight and I was anchored by the helping hands of some local ready\
  \ to bring me back on the frozen surface of Chadar. The moment and everything associated\
  \ with it was mine for the taking from the dip and I realized: \u201CSometimes all\
  \ you need to take is a leap of faith\u201D."
