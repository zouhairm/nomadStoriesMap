Text: "I had told myself that there was no way I wasn't going to swim while we visited\
  \ Capri. The air hung heavy and hot, my hair stuck to my face where drips of sweat\
  \ rolled down my skin. The light coating of sea spray that splashed onto my legs\
  \ was cool and refreshing, enveloping my body in relief from the sun as as I struggled\
  \ to walk over the smooth, grey rock beach and into the water.\nMy friends barrelled\
  \ down the beach. In their loud, screaming voices they threw themselves around me\
  \ and into the waves. My hair whipped against my face as I was picked up and tossed,\
  \ as if I weighed nothing, deeper into the sea as we pulled further and further\
  \ away from the beach. I let myself sink under the water, opening my eyes against\
  \ the sting of the salt as a grin spread across my face. In front of me, there was\
  \ nothing but aquamarine and legs that attached tanned calves and pale thighs, where\
  \ bathing suit shorts pulled away from skin that hadn't been kissed by the sun,\
  \ that treaded water to keep their heads above water. \nIt was Kyle who pulled me\
  \ to the surface, a boy I would never have met if it hadn't been for this trip,\
  \ and three-hour long bus rides through Tuscany watching cartoon movies on a small,\
  \ black iPod Nano. He pulled me against his body, and his laugh was the first thing\
  \ that I heard when I broke the surface of the water. Laughing at my gasp for air\
  \ as all I could focus on was his hand pressed against my back and the sun burning\
  \ against my fair skin. His blond hair darkened with the water, pressing against\
  \ his forehead as I laughed along with him; not entirely sure what the joke was\
  \ but still thriving off the happiness I felt with them.\nFaith splashed water at\
  \ us before diving underneath of the waves as we spun around to launch our attack\
  \ at her. We laughed as we struggled to tread water and fill our lungs with air\
  \ before dropping under and chasing after her. \nI chased Faith and Kyle through\
  \ the water, just as I chased the dream of staying here, on this beach, in this\
  \ water forever and never having to leave. \nIt wasn't until I got home that I realized\
  \ I had lost my necklace. My necklace with the four-leaf clover that must have fallen\
  \ off somewhere between Capri and Rome. It was then that I promised myself I would\
  \ go back to Italy and trace my way back to the coast of Capri; in hopes of finding\
  \ my four-leaf clover and the piece of me that I left in the Tyrrhenian Sea."
