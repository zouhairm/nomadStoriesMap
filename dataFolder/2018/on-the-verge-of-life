Text: "There are some moments in life when you feel free and then there are those\
  \ rare times in which you feel liberated \u2013 like the burden of the world has\
  \ been lifted off your feeble shoulders.\n\nNot too long ago, in January 2016, I\
  \ visited a friend in Melbourne. The trip was long due and the expectations from\
  \ the beautiful city had only risen over time. After countless hours of research,\
  \ I made an almost-perfect itinerary, which I eventually found itself in the form\
  \ of a crumpled paper in my bag.\n\nUpon landing in Melbourne, my friend proudly\
  \ announced his plan to take me away to the Grampians, a national park nestled in\
  \ a corner not too far away from the main city. Adventures are always welcome, but\
  \ I would\u2019ve preferred wandering in the by-lanes of the city first, at least\
  \ until the jet-lag faded away, before unravelling hidden crevices.\nAfter a 3-hour\
  \ long drive meandering through green pastures of land and encountering a few kangaroos\
  \ here and there, we finally made it to the Grampians National Park by lunchtime.\
  \ The prospect of climbing up the exhilarating mountains and sauntering in the forests\
  \ made me lose my appetite. So instead of digging into a meal, we decided to start\
  \ our little hike.\n\nAfter a lot of walking, tripping and falling, we reached an\
  \ observation deck packed with plenty of tourists. All I wanted was one photograph\
  \ to capture what my eyes were seeing, but before I could take my camera out, my\
  \ friend pulled me away into a reclusive spot and said, \u201CJump the security\
  \ railing and sit on the edge of the mountain. It will change your life.\u201D\n\
  \nAs adventurous as I think I am, I avoid flouting rules that could land me in danger.\
  \ My hesitation conflicted with my impulse. I don\u2019t know what it was, but it\
  \ felt like all the energies that were held captive inside me would find a release\
  \ in that bold trespassing feat. Without overthinking, I gave in to my instincts,\
  \ used all my arm-strength and leaped on the other side of the metal fence. The\
  \ mountain had a protrusion, just enough for one person to sit. I delicately balanced\
  \ myself and got to the tip of it. And there I was, under an azure sky, dangling\
  \ my feet at an unfathomable height, overlooking the verdant valleys. I was there\
  \ just for a few minutes before the guards came by, but that experience has made\
  \ an everlasting imprint on my heart. Although the fear of falling was so palpable,\
  \ there was a deep-rooted sense of liberation that I had never felt before. \n\n\
  And as my friend predicted, it did change my life."
