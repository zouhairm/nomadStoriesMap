Text: "I stared up at the Cathedral windows and vaulted ceilings with the feeling\
  \ I always get stood within one of those holy places and said a prayer to my own\
  \ version of God.\n\nI had left the hostel before sunrise that morning, bored of\
  \ the noise and the ongoing parties of those coming to Prague only for the price\
  \ of liquor, and I had wandered her streets in the silence of a new day.\n\nSt Vitus\u2019\
  \ cathedral stands tall and proud over the Vltava and the rest of the city, the\
  \ most perfect Gothic silhouette looking more like a fortified castle than a place\
  \ of worship. I started up the seemingly everlasting hill and made it to the entrance\
  \ just as they were opening the doors for visitors.\n\nThat is how I found myself\
  \ quietly stood in a corner looking up at the awe-inspiring building surrounded\
  \ only by a few jet-lagged Australian families and one small Czech nun on her knees\
  \ rosary beads in hand, saying a silent prayer.\n\nIt was this nun, maybe only five\
  \ minutes later, who opened a can of Coca Cola and held it out to me, I smiled and\
  \ accepted, my crippling British politeness hiding the worry of a caffeine and sugar\
  \ high at 9am. \n\n\u201CDo you travel alone?\u201D She asked me in English.\n\n\
  The question startled me, this trip around Europe was the first one I had ever done\
  \ on my own, a fact I was very aware of and still coming to terms with. After a\
  \ short hesitation I nodded to her question.\n\n\u201CNo person ever travels alone,\
  \ for every new memory is a new friend\u201D\n\nSilence again as I sipped my Coca\
  \ Cola and she hummed tunelessly, I was unable to speak for this woman was addressing\
  \ the exact fears I had been having of feeling isolated despite having an entire\
  \ continent at my fingertips.\n\n\u201CYou have been to Prague before, yes?\u201D\
  \n\nI again nodded and this time managed to reply: \u2018Yes, I have been here twice\
  \ when I was young, how did you know?\u2019\n\n\u2018Because you carry your friends\
  \ in your eyes, and I could see them here with you when you walked in\u2019\n\n\
  Shortly after we parted ways and I found myself writing this brief conversation\
  \ down as quickly as I could whilst sat on a wall. I snacked from a pack of marshmallows\
  \ and finished my can of Coca Cola and considered that from this interaction with\
  \ my nameless nun from St Vitus cathedral she had made herself a memory of this\
  \ place, and in doing so, made herself my first new friend of many more to come."
