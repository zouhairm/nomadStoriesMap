Text: "The sky was a pale shade of grey. It was drizzling all morning. I sat with\
  \ my little notebook, pen and a hot mug of tea. In front of me lay the beautiful\
  \ panorama of the gigantic Himalayan mountain range. I was sitting in the balcony\
  \ of Caf\xE9 Illiterati, a quaint coffee cum bookshop in sleepy McLeod Ganj, a hilly\
  \ suburb in the Kangra district of Himachal Pradesh in India. \n\nI had just quit\
  \ my steady, well-paying job, taken an overnight bus from New Delhi and landed here\
  \ with no itinerary - just one backpack, some money and a hunger for adventure.\
  \ It was here at Cafe Iliterati that I met my Tibetan friends for the first time.\
  \ Twenty-seven-year old Tenzin Phuntsok was a poet and a talented musician. He was\
  \ a monk in Tibet till 10-years-old, before he had to flee to India. Jamyang Dolma,\
  \ 21, on the other hand, was born in India. She had come to McLeod to visit her\
  \ long distance boyfriend 29-year-old Shiwapa Kunkyab Pasang, who worked as a language\
  \ translator. I bonded with them instantly.\n\nOutside the Dalai Lama temple, I\
  \ bumped into Jamyang the next day. She made me taste laping - a bowl full of flat\
  \ noodles soaked in delicious, tangy gravy. After eating, Jamyang offered to walk\
  \ with me till Cafe Illiterati, albeit, via a shortcut through the forest. She lead\
  \ me on as I jumped, stumbled and made my way through the mountainous forest, trying\
  \ my best to keep up pace. After few minutes of trek, I jumped off from a height\
  \ on the road, and there it was - Cafe Illiterati! If I had taken the main road,\
  \ it would\u2019ve taken me forever to climb uphill. Only the locals knew these\
  \ shortcuts through the mountains and forests and I was lucky to be their friend.\n\
  \nOne day, Jamyang and Shiwa took me to watch a football match final organised by\
  \ the Tibet Sports Association. We sat on the mountain-top and cheered for a team\
  \ I've never heard of before. At dinner that night, Shiwa spoke solemnly about his\
  \ memories of Tibet and how he misses his family. On my last day, Jamyang made me\
  \ gatecrash a Tibetan wedding. While all women there looked stunning, I was in my\
  \ Harry Potter teeshirt, torn denims and sneakers. My friends came to see me off\
  \ at the bus stand and gave me a book called \"A Home in Tibet\" and a white-coloured\
  \ traditional Tibetan silk scarf called 'Khata' that symbolises goodwill. I left\
  \ each one of them with handwritten postcards. \n\nThis was three years back. And\
  \ I\u2019m still in touch with each one of them. Who knew a local connection would\
  \ turn into lifelong friendships?"
