Text: "I probably should have told my brother that we were stranded in the midst of\
  \ a tsunami warning. I probably should have alerted he and his girlfriend that we\
  \ might be about to die. But I didn't want to wake them so I went back to bed and\
  \ pretended it wasn't happening. \n\nIt was southwest Mexico. The midnight air was\
  \ thick with the kind of heat that hits you hard as you step out of a rattly aeroplane,\
  \ your hair suddenly much too close to the back of your neck and you are always\
  \ wearing too many clothes. We were staying in a guesthouse that backed onto a thick\
  \ green national park and eventually the Pacific Ocean. It was a 10-minute walk\
  \ to the beach along a single rocky path that wound past a gentleman with one leg\
  \ named Jos\xE9 who collected the 10-peso entrance fee and down to palm covered\
  \ sand and ladies selling tacos pescado (fish) at twice the usual price. \n\nA lady\
  \ called Blanca owned the guesthouse, her kids were noisy as they played in the\
  \ yard, the TV a backdrop to their laughter. It was her voice we heard in the night:\n\
  \"Amigos, are you ok?\"\nWe looked at each other as the building shook, it felt\
  \ like minutes but it could have only been seconds, my hands were tight on the railing.\
  \ It had started with a banging. Slow at first and becoming more rapid, something\
  \ like a train might sound as it whips past in close proximity. I watched the glass\
  \ panels in the door shake continuously, what was happening? As the ground grew\
  \ still we staggered back to our beds, eyes shiny with adrenaline.  \n\nHours later\
  \ it was Blanca again: \n\"Amiga, the TV says a tsunami is coming. I am taking the\
  \ ni\xF1os to higher ground.\"\n\nWithin seconds she was gone. I grabbed my phone,\
  \ there was no reception. I heard the TV switch off and a car pull away. Why had\
  \ she told only me?\nI blinked the sleep from my eyes and walked outside. I could\
  \ trace the hill between us and the ocean looming in the night sky. How does a tsunami\
  \ travel? Would it wind up the path and take Jos\xE9? Does he sit there at night?\
  \ It seemed peaceful. Something chirped in the bushes and I could almost believe\
  \ that none of it had happened. \n\nI looked at my brother's door and pictured us\
  \ dragging our possessions as we ran into the night, ocean licking at our ankles.\
  \ I was tired. I wished I didn't know. \n\nI climbed back into bed. \n\nIt was only\
  \ the following day that we discovered the earthquake was the biggest to have hit\
  \ Mexico in 100 years. We asked a waiter if he knew more about the tsunami warning.\n\
  \n\"Tsunami?\" he said. \n\"Is that a type of fish?\""
