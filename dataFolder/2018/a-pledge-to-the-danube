Text: "An honest man is always resolved to keep his oaths, or so my father used to\
  \ say. Thus having promised myself a visit to Vienna for years, I got around the\
  \ expensive tickets by flying through Budapest, where I had to stay for one night.\
  \ How short-sighted man can be, to focus so much on his final destination and think\
  \ nothing of one brief sojourn that comes in between.\n\nAs I arrived at the Budapest\
  \ airport, eager to see the city and anxious to not miss the bus, I started rushing\
  \ out. That is, until my sight froze onto a young lady wearing a green fluttering\
  \ dress, not because of her alluring looks or her distressed countenance, but because\
  \ of the many coins she dropped on the floor. Trying to be chivalrous, I asked \u2018\
  Would you like-\u2019\n\u2018No thanks!\u2019 she interrupted as she hastily rushed\
  \ away. \nI exited and hopped on a bus to the city and quickly noticed a pair of\
  \ piercing blue eyes looking straight at me. Clearly, the man was having a conversation\
  \ with somebody next to him, but for the entire journey it felt as if he was speaking\
  \ to me. \u2018Are all Hungarian people this quaint?\u2019 I asked myself. \n\n\
  Later that afternoon I climbed the Gell\xE9rt Hill, sat beside the freedom statue\
  \ and thought it fitting to read a chapter from my book by Nietzsche. After a few\
  \ pages, a voice interrupted from behind,\u2018You'll never understand it\u2019\
  . I turned round to see the man on the bus, \u2018Art precedes philosophy, and Goethe\u2019\
  s Faust is the sub-consciousness to what you\u2019re reading\u2019 he continued.\
  \ And thus started a most heart-warming conversation - with the man on the bus,\
  \ Kamil. He later offered to show me around his hometown and snuck me onto a tour\
  \ bus where he works and at night didn\u2019t let me part until I tried at least\
  \ five different shots of P\xE1linka. After a brief tour that felt like a year-long\
  \ friendship, Kamil pointed to the river bank and said \u2018Be there tomorrow at\
  \ noon, and I\u2019ll bring you my copy of Faust\u2019. I agreed and left off to\
  \ sleep.\n\nAnd there I waited, looking at the imposing verdant freedom statue that\
  \ now stood across and above the Danube. At the strike of noon, I saw the girl in\
  \ the green dress looking at me! She smiled, started walking towards me and then\
  \ stopped right in front of me. She didn\u2019t utter a word, took a book out of\
  \ her linen bag and said \u2018My brother is sorry he couldn\u2019t make it, but\
  \ he was resolved that you should have this\u2019. I thought I should return her\
  \ kindness and buy her a coffee,\n\u2018Would you like-\u2019\n\u2018Yes\u2019 she\
  \ interrupted again, wearing her brother\u2019s smile."
