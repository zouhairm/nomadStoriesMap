Text: "Were we about to be trafficked? If so, what would the tabloid headlines scream\
  \ the next day? These baseless fears ran through my weary tourist mind as my Jordanian\
  \ taxi driver to an unknown destination. Through a mess of broken English and nonsensical\
  \ Googletranslate Arabic, he\u2019d promised to take me to \u201Ca friend\u201D\
  \ who was willing to drive me from the seaside town of Aqaba to iconic Petra.\n\n\
  The taxi driver stopped outside a house in the middle of suburbia and indicated\
  \ I should get into a white van. A quiet young boy with camel eyelashes sat in the\
  \ passenger\u2019s seat. I looked at him and he looked at his lap. I got in uncertainly.\
  \ Eventually a man that must\u2019ve been his father lumbered heavily into the driver\u2019\
  s seat, flashing a smile in a bright flash of infamous Jordanian hospitality. \n\
  \nHe drove his mute passengers down the Desert Highway. It was endless, winding\
  \ its way through a landscape of desolate beauty. The red-gold dessert stretched\
  \ like a Martian canvas around us, in no rush to reach the horizon. The sky was\
  \ a crisp light blue, full of promise. I felt I was travelling through a surrealist\
  \ painting, or a Dr Seuss book. \n\nAll the while, my driver explained Jordan\u2019\
  s history, provided thoughtful commentary and even told jokes through gesture. If\
  \ charades existed as an Olympic sport, he would\u2019ve won gold. When we passed\
  \ neat rows of agriculture, he would mime a gnawing squirrel so I\u2019d understand\
  \ it was a corn farm. When we drove passed tents stamped with the UN logo, he even\
  \ managed to explain that Jordan had taken in Syrian refugees.\n\nThe boy watched\
  \ father\u2019s generous interpretive dance with me with great solemnity. This three\
  \ hour road trip with his father was clearly part of a greater story of respect\
  \ and safety. \n\nHe eventually dared to ask a question about the expansive lake\
  \ we were driving past. With equal seriousness, his father began to explain. I saw\
  \ his father begin to mime an epic story of a giant octopus, blowing out expanses\
  \ of water through a straw. I wished I knew Arabic. It took me back to the road-trips\
  \ my own father had taken me on in through the Australian dessert, where he\u2019\
  d spin stories with no end to sustain me for thousands of kilometres.\n\nWhen I\
  \ eventually arrived in Petra, I meandered past its towering mausoleums and experienced\
  \ the majesty of an ancient civilisation etched into stone for posterity. But I\
  \ knew that on my way here, the awe of a young son that I had witnessed was no less\
  \ precious or lasting."
