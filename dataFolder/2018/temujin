Text: "A treasured meeting of mine happened in Jiuzhaigou National Park, China. After\
  \ a hair-raising journey to Songpan in Sichuan, involving a bus, narrow gorge and\
  \ some bees (don't ask), we had set off to the national park on horseback, planning\
  \ to spend two days in the park exploring its stunning, crystal lakes and hot springs.\n\
  Songpan itself is an interesting town in the Sichuan mountains. Many of the locals\
  \ have similar features to their Tibetan neighbours and there are several mosques,\
  \ Islam apparently being brought with servants and slaves when Ghengis Khan took\
  \ over much of Northern China. I had been reading about Ghengis or Temujin as he's\
  \ also known and as we headed over the mountains on horseback and one of our guides\
  \ began to sing, I was reminded of him again. \n I had no idea of what his song\
  \ was about, but the oscillation of his song, winding with beautiful twists and\
  \ turns, reminded me of the calls to prayer and local songs I had heard in Morocco.\
  \ It was stunning and as we took in the sweeping valley below, for a moment I could\
  \ picture some far-off scene from history. Arriving in the park, we decided to wander\
  \ up to see the hot springs. Jiuzhaigo is popular but November is the start of 'off-season'\
  \ so we had it to ourselves. We passed mirror-still lakes, eye-catching with bright\
  \ emerald and turquoise shades, from algae that grows on the dead trees and other\
  \ leaf litter on the bottom. \nAny picture you see will never do it justice but\
  \ we couldn't stare at them forever and eventually, after a short walk we reached\
  \ the hot springs. Hot might be exaggerating. Known for their skin cleansing properties\
  \ (possibly due to their acidic nature) the spring were nonetheless a soothing tepid\
  \ temperature and pleasantly bubbly. After a while I hopped out, wrapped my towel\
  \ around and sat on the side, the afternoon sun and steam warming me as I relaxed\
  \ and read.\nAfter a while, I became aware of one of the gatekeepers approaching.\
  \ I smiled at him and, perhaps buoyed by this he pointed to my book and made a vague\
  \ book gesture with a questioning expression. I'm not sure if he really asked but\
  \ at my mention of Temujin his face lit up with understanding and he smiled. A semi-awkward\
  \ sign conversation followed. Was the book good? Did I like Temujin? It wasn't \
  \ very complex but for a moment, it was a small yet perfect moment shared by two\
  \ complete strangers who couldn't even speak each other's language and when I look\
  \ back on that trip and that day, I smile and treasure it."
