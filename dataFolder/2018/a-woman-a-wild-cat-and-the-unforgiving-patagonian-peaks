Text: "As I lay 18km into the depths of Torres Del Paine National Park, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but smile. With 42km of rain, hail, snow, and sunshine ahead of me I felt\
  \ as if I was the only person in the world.  Day one my body hurt, day two my mind\
  \ ached. My bones were wet. The wind tore through so ferociously, at first I forgot\
  \ where I was. A constant state of fatigue and water logged skin only seemed worth\
  \ it all when I\u2019d catch an avalanche in the corner of my eye. Or for a short,\
  \ sweet moment; sporadic sun beams casted across the land and illuminated the whole\
  \ spectrum of colours at play in Chilean Patagonia. Day three my stove ran out of\
  \ gas and I forced down raw eggs to keep me sustained. It began to snow relentlessly\
  \ and I remember whilst peeing at 3:00am the undeniable feeling I was being watched.\
  \ Given the following day I kept seeing puma footprints walking with me, I feel\
  \ as though I may have cheated death. (Just to be a little dramatic)\nOn the final\
  \ morning of my five day, 60km solo hike- I sat. I opened myself entirely, for the\
  \ first time, to all that surrounded me. In a faraway valley, below a grand pink\
  \ kissed mountain; I watched the world wake up. It was there, almost instantaneously,\
  \ that everything seemed so very small. Menial problems we acquired in our humdrum\
  \ living seemed so very far away from this reality.   \nI understood, in one epiphanic\
  \ moment, that every atom has a time and place in the world. Nature is always moving\
  \ around us, in no particular direction. It can catch us unaware and throw us off\
  \ of our feet. It can soothe, ignite and disturb even the deepest, most hidden corners\
  \ of our being. It is the truest form of realisation and acceptance that we as humans\
  \ are a mere speck of dust floating. Drifting in a galaxy of everlasting, unpredictable\
  \ wilderness. 'This Earth will swallow us whole' I wrote in my diary.\nOn my return\
  \ back to the sleepy town of Puerto Natales, the last thing I expected was to be\
  \ greeted by locals in awe of my accomplishments. \n\u201CStrong Woman\u201D was\
  \ a term often heard. However rare it was to see solo female travellers trail through\
  \ their lives in Summer they definitely did not expect this lady to come probing\
  \ with her camera in the dead of Winter. However foggy my memory gets, I try to\
  \ hold on to what I know is real. The emotion materialised by natures sheer beauty\
  \ will never cease to amaze me. The warmth a person can bring into your life is\
  \ overwhelming."
