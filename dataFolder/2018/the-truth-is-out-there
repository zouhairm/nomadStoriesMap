Text: "When I was traveling to Italy in March last spring, the last thing that I expected\
  \ was to fall in love with a stranger. The experience, centered around historical\
  \ and cultural explorations, emerged into an avalanche of emotions, discoveries\
  \ and spiritual enrichment. Despite economic difficulties, the country remains one\
  \ of the most charming lands with global heritage. We started our journey in the\
  \ capital of Lombardy, Milan. The amalgam of developed industries is mesmerizing\
  \ starting from arts, fashion to education and finance. Although Duomo and Sforza\
  \ Castle are among the main attractions, I was interested to understand where do\
  \ the Italians get the indescribable soulfulness and genuine life satisfaction.\
  \ For this we also visited less touristic areas and engaged into informal discussions\
  \ with the locals. The outcome was (not) surprising, considering the modern era\
  \ we live in currently. It turned out that espresso, pasta and family are the main\
  \ drivers for a balanced life. \nOn the second day, we planned to visit the medieval\
  \ town of Verona. On the way there though, our sight was captured by amazing crystal\
  \ waters surrounded by the magnificent Alps. It is the largest lake in Northern\
  \ Italy, Lago di Garda. The landscape, breathtaking views, unimaginable clear water,\
  \ makes your visit worth a lifetime. We had lunch at a beautiful terrace with the\
  \ sound of water embracing your ears and smell of blossoming flowers caressing your\
  \ nose. I urged to contemplate with the nature and memorize these images and feelings\
  \ forever in my heart. \nWhen we arrived in Verona, we felt a truly warm welcome.\
  \ We lived next to the Arena di Verona however our hearts led us to the famous House\
  \ of Giulietta. Despite being a fiction story, it left our hearts beating and emerge\
  \ into the philosophical thoughts about true love. The locals here seemed even more\
  \ joyful. After discussions, our list got extended with one more item called \u201C\
  wine\u201D. Locals say that wine not only has medical benefits but keeps the family\
  \ together. \nOur last point was the city of canals, Venice. Although my expectations\
  \ were high, the city gave me vague impressions. Despite historical background there\
  \ is lack of organization, which gives a special charm to the country as such. One\
  \ thing is certain in Italy: money, power and technology cannot make you fully happy\
  \ if you don\u2019t have espresso, pasta, wine and family. I discovered this stranger\
  \ called Italy with my own eyes and completely and utterly fell in love."
