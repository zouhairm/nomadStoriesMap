Text: "Somewhere between the Middle Atlas Mountains and Merzouga, a village in the\
  \ Sahara Desert, we take a break.\nI stumble over the worn rocks which stretch from\
  \ the dusty gravel road to the small creek at the base of a rough-rocked mountain.\
  \ On the far side of the cloudy water there\u2019s a wide bush sprouting from a\
  \ pile of pale rocks with discarded clothes hanging from its branches like a carelessly\
  \ decorated Christmas tree. A flash of plum purple and another of bright orange\
  \ peak out from the dusty whites. I study it as I enter the water, stepping carefully\
  \ on the rocks and enjoying the cold water as it sloshes against my feet.\nAway\
  \ from the crowded Muslim cities, I\u2019ve swapped my modest clothing for western\
  \ summer essentials and I enjoyed the reprieve of shorts and a singlet. Though I\
  \ kept a scarf close at hand, to drape over my bare shoulders on the rare occasions\
  \ we meet other travellers.\nOverhead, the sky is pale blue, the sunlight clear\
  \ and crisp. It beats down at a steady 38\xB0C and shows no sign of cooling. It\
  \ seems hotter, surrounded by the dry dirt roads and dusty rock faces with the smell\
  \ of hot earth and sweat in my nose.\nThis isn\u2019t a particularly picturesque\
  \ part of Morocco, unlike the sweeping vistas and gorges in parts of the Atlas Mountains,\
  \ it is barren and dry, the rocks and mountains jutting up randomly from the grey\
  \ earth. It looks alien, like we\u2019ve stumbled onto the Moon or Mars.   \nA cry\
  \ goes up from one of my companions. Standing shin-deep in the cloudy water, his\
  \ attention is fixed on his cupped hands held in front of him. When I make my way\
  \ to him, he offers his hands to me and I peer inside to see a small, black frog,\
  \ sitting contently in the creases of his palms.\nI laugh. The speck of life seems\
  \ strange in the barren and grey landscape. But that\u2019s what Morocco is like,\
  \ splashes of the spectacular and fantastical mixed in with modern cities, bare\
  \ landscapes, sweeping vistas and the clash and chaos of crowds. This small, alien\
  \ spot, between the Atlas Mountains and the astonishing beauty of the Sahara Desert,\
  \ is an unexpected pleasure.\nIn the days that follow, we\u2019d wander deeper into\
  \ the desert. But for now, I linger in the water, squinting against the bright sunshine\
  \ until we see figures approaching. The creek is a popular spot for the local nomad\
  \ people who travel through this part of Morocco, and we\u2019re inappropriately\
  \ dressed and are in mixed company, so we make our way back to our minibus and climb\
  \ on board, leaving it to the local men."
