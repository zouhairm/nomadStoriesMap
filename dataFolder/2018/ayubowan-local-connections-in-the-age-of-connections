Text: "The architecture took me back to my sojourns in Hanoi and Bali. Common sightings\
  \ of Tata, Ashok Leyland and Bajaj delighted me while road signs in 3 languages\
  \ reminded me of home. Even the rupee currency and the faces of its people, recognizable.\
  \ \nThe first person I spoke to, Mr Perera, conversed with me in Hindi. Decked in\
  \ a white safari suit, he was a bubbly and stout middle-aged man, who picked up\
  \ pieces of the language when he worked with Indians in the Middle East. It could\
  \ be why he did not recognize my Hindi was non-native as well. \n\nI was not comfortable\
  \ flagging the rickshaw of just anyone to get to my outskirt city hotel. Concerns\
  \ like inflating the fare to what and whom I should contact if anything untoward\
  \ happened to me replayed. It was from there, I found Mr Perera, through the ride-sharing\
  \ app I occasionally used back home. \nI did not know my exact location but through\
  \ the app, Mr Perera, peer-rated 4.8 out of 5, was able to locate me and my hotel\
  \ with ease. We both knew the route suggested according to real-time traffic and\
  \ the destination arrival time. The fare was also transparent and I could even pay\
  \ from the card details already inputted in my account, which was great, given the\
  \ ATM dispensed me merely a few Lankan rupees.\n\nHow did we live and travel before\
  \ such business models became our lives? I was very proud of the innovations we\
  \ have and will continue to have, but the more I thought about it, my bright eyes\
  \ faded. Drivers like Mr Perera would only receive t a paltry amount of the fare\
  \ from the company. I questioned how I was able to outsource my trust to a third\
  \ party I had never seen rather than the person right in front of me? \nTo charter\
  \ the unchartered. To learn about another country and its culture through the locals.\
  \ To exchange our stories and forge an authentic relationship based on human connections.\
  \ Wasn't that the whole point? \n\n\"Yeh Independence Square.\" He smiled brightly\
  \ at me, signaling me to get off at an uncalled stop. I knew where this was heading.\
  \ Scrambling through the notes I had, to which, he profusely refused. He just wanted\
  \ to me to see his country's sights in my short transit. \nAs I stood in awe of\
  \ the history of the square and Mr Perera's generosity, I marveled at the merge\
  \ of internet connections, smartphones, apps and innovation. It has given people\
  \ like Mr Perera, the ability to earn a living, and me, a peace of mind, as a solo\
  \ traveler. I however pondered if there was a better way of using these tools."
