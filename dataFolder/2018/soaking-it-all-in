Text: "\u201CNaked! No Clothes! Ok!\u201D \n\nA thin, elderly man in a tank top barked\
  \ at me as I paid my way into the Long Nai Tang Hot Spring, the oldest soaking spring\
  \ in Xinbeitou.\n\n\u201C42 degrees!\u201D\n\nMy Fahrenheit to Celsius conversion\
  \ was spotty but I nodded that I understood it was hot.\n\n\u201CShoes!\u201D\n\n\
  I was to remove them.\n\nHis arthritic finger pointed to the ladies\u2019 side of\
  \ the spa. Inside, an intimate alcove held a few wooden benches. I peered around\
  \ the corner and slowly entered the soaking room, joining about a dozen Taiwanese\
  \ women, bathing or resting. Quiet.\n\nThe women directed me with friendly gestures\
  \ toward a wall with cubicles to store my clothes. They were kind, yet clear there\
  \ were rules to follow. Protocol and custom guide everything in this country. \n\
  \nLuckily a couple ladies spoke enough English to instruct me. A topless woman who\
  \ had lived in the States told me how to wash before entering the pool, and where\
  \ to stand so the water runs the right way. How to get in the water, how to sit,\
  \ how to take breaks.\n\nThey watched me, the only westerner, as I prepared to enter\
  \ the pool. As my comparatively large and clumsy laowai body slipped into the water,\
  \ nervous eyes pleaded with me to go slowly. Immediately the reason became clear.\n\
  \n42 degrees Celsius is 107.6 Fahrenheit. Hot tubs have to be hacked to exceed 104.\
  \ I was legitimately cooking.\n\nI rapidly realized the etiquette of the pool was\
  \ a safety precaution \u2013 even a slight ripple on the surface would scald any\
  \ skin that wasn\u2019t yet blanched, awakening parts of the body that had gone\
  \ dormant from pain. Even though I sat on the highest bench, it was all I could\
  \ do to stay submerged for three minutes before gingerly climbing onto the ledge.\
  \ They smiled at me, and nodded. \n\nI stayed for a time, testing my resolve in\
  \ the water, enjoying the camaraderie of the small space. Women who took care of\
  \ themselves, and each other. Marks from cupping or scraping on their backs. Small,\
  \ calm, happy conversations in a meditative space. One woman sat deep in the pool\
  \ the whole time I was there. The fiercest show of control I have ever seen. \n\n\
  Later, I ate beef noodles and egg scallion soup with a Taiwan beer at Jacky\u2019\
  s Hot Dog Bar. As I ate, my skin still stinging an hour later, my body felt like\
  \ your tongue after eating really hot soup, simultaneously sore and numb to its\
  \ normal function. But my soul felt restored - whether due to the properties of\
  \ the waters or the community that was shared with me, I\u2019ll never be able to\
  \ say."
