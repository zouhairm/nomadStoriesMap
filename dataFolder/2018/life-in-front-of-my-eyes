Text: "A luggage filled with dreams and expectations being held by a girl who just\
  \ turned 18\u2026 this is the memory I have of me crossing the doors of the airport\
  \ and finding myself at a country completely different and unknown, replete of opportunities,\
  \ possibilities and new things to be explored. That was my first international trip\
  \ ever, with other 49 students \u2013 friends and strangers at the same time sharing\
  \ that unique experience.\nFrom the bus window I was looking at everything with\
  \ astonishment\u2026 San Francisco was bursting in colors even though it was winter.\
  \ Those trees in a stunning green, so majestically tall, gently blocking the lazy\
  \ sunlight; all of those cars on the avenue, coming and going, mixing in colors\
  \ from blue to yellow; the houses in pastel tons perfectly organized on that California\u2019\
  s quiet neighborhood. Just like in the movies, or perhaps more mesmerizing. \n We\
  \ were going to a very special place and my heart was beating happily fast while\
  \ my curious eyes were trying to save every single piece of that experience forever\
  \ on my mind. \nI was the first student to leave the bus. \n\u201CYou must be back\
  \ on the bus in 20 minutes\u201D was the last thing I heard and then everything\
  \ seemed to move in slow motion. \nNo clouds outside, only the deep blue sky, the\
  \ reflections of the sun on the water and the extraordinarily red Golden Gate Bridge.\
  \ In front of me, my biggest dream. Marvelous, wonderful, magnificent and unbelievable.\
  \ \nI had to close my eyes for a second and felt the dry air gently touching my\
  \ face and messing my hair, took a deep breath and told myself it wasn\u2019t a\
  \ dream. Not that time. At that day I could finally tell that dreams do come true,\
  \ you just need to make it work. \nWhen I opened my eyes, all of my friends and\
  \ tourists were striking funny poses and taking pictures. I was wondering how I\
  \ could save that moment for a lifetime. Not me in front of a worldwide famous spot,\
  \ but all of those humans, so different from each other, so unique, smiling and\
  \ sharing that piece of their lives. It was like a canvas and I was also a part\
  \ of that frame.  \nAt that moment, the jet lag didn\u2019t matter, or how far I\
  \ was from home, but how connected I felt to that instant moment of joy and peace.\
  \ I felt small close to the bridge, but I felt part of something big, part of a\
  \ memory that would never fade from the memory of 49 other human beings."
