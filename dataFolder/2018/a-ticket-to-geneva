Text: "It's not very wise!\nWhen you know you will have absolutely no money to go\
  \ back, then it's stupid to experiment! Especially when the mercury shows freaking\
  \ -10. From the top floor of the youth hostel, the uncanny howling of the Swiss\
  \ wind over half-frozen Geneva Lake doesn't let you sleep. But still, I got to go.\
  \ By then it became a project to me.\nHow's it possible no one recognizes Chaplin\
  \ here? Whenever I am asking they are giving that bizarre look. Or they are just\
  \ being surprised to see a girl struggling with a heavy trolley bag in this snow?\
  \ It started snowing since morning. Everything is just under a thick quilt. Even\
  \ the local people are not seen on the road in this end December winter and a silly\
  \ Indian girl is looking for the communal cemetery!\nThe plan was basically to visit\
  \ Chaplin's grave in Corsier-sur-Vevey. And I was running out of the budget. In\
  \ the time of crucial decision making my brain stops working. So in a trance, I\
  \ just bought a one-way ticket to Vevey from Geneva and then kept going. Yes, I\
  \ accomplished my project and bravely took the train to Geneva without a ticket!\
  \ Near Lausanne when the ticket checker came, my brain again started behaving differently.\
  \ And I was showing him the Geneva city pass, all my empty bank cards and even my\
  \ Indian debit cards which were not going to work here anyway! He smiled at me,\
  \ \u2018I am going to the other compartment and then coming back.' It clearly meant,\
  \ \u2018Please get off!'\nI have a morning flight to Paris from Geneva. So I have\
  \ an entire night to walk. The road sign shows Geneva airport straight heading across\
  \ the autoroute. I have no idea how to reach there. I, trembling in the light rain\
  \ and snow, and my trolley again started scrolling down the streets. I was optimistic\
  \ enough that I would reach, definitely in time, no matter how absurd it sounds.\
  \ I saw a middle-aged man garaging his car. I approached towards him and asked,\
  \ \u2018Is this the way to Geneva airport? How far is it?' He was surprised, visibly,\
  \ and he looked around me, \u2018This is the highway. How will you go?' \u2018I\
  \ am planning to walk.' \u2018Are you crazy? Look at the snow!'\nI had to explain\
  \ all from the scratch. And then what happened I really didn't expect. He drove\
  \ me to the station, bought me a ticket to Geneva, and asked me repeatedly to be\
  \ sure if I really had a ticket to Paris! When I was asking for his bank details\
  \ so that I could reimburse, he just said, \u2018I was also young someday, and there\
  \ was somebody to support my craziness! Keep going!'"
