Text: 'I have not been to much places...I hv, when I was small...but then I don''t
  exactly remember...i travelled a bit during my internship as a dentist...Since my
  parents were protective,I was pretty sure I wouldn''t be able to travel anymore
  with friends and have fun once i leave college and go back home...I travelled to
  coorg also known as madikeri jn karnataka ,india as my last resort of freedom to
  travel and explore.it''s called as the "Scotland of India".

  This place is of tourist attention and has a pleasant climate...Its quite similiar
  to kodaikanal which is in Tamil Nadu..

  One can get to see the top view from Rajaseat and its mesmersing with fog covering
  your head...You can smell coffee everywhere which makes you feel warm in the cold
  weather...they even serve flavored corn in a cup and raw mangoes...which are my
  favorite...

  Next you can go to the musuem where you get to see Tipu Sultan''s fort...he was
  a ruler ..one can get a see a large elephant statue in the fort premises...its believed
  that if you walk under an elephant...all your fears will vanish..Our next stop wad
  Golden Temple.It was built in name of Late monk Rimponchi..once you enter the temple...you
  can see how naive and pious the monks are...even the tiny lilttle ones...Their prayer
  can make your mind and heart at ease...The temple design is spectacular where hundreds
  of people come and visit everyday...

  There was one more place to visit...Dobare..where three are elephants and get to
  river raft.But due to the time limitations...we had to backup from Madikeri to our
  place...

  Thus this was the last thing I expected and I could do to my last few days of freedom.'
