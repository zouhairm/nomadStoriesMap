Text: "Sunny afternoons aren\u2019t always sunny. Despite the advertisement of a 4.6\
  \ billion years old star, some sunny afternoons have been guilty of clouding the\
  \ murder of a brown-eyed childhood by her teacher. 18 years later, after a life\
  \ of sunny afternoons that changed from molested to mostly sunny, it was time for\
  \ her to seek brighter nights. \n\nStanding at the entrance of Nizamuddin Train\
  \ Station, she was welcomed by a chaos that mirrored the one brewing inside her.\
  \ Squalls of hungry children competed against the obedient electronic announcements,\
  \ while the rancid smell of human faeces littered on the railway tracks waged its\
  \ own war against the odour of communal sweat and aromatic food stalls. \n\n\u201C\
  You\u2019re lucky,\u201D the ticket officer said. \u201CSomebody made a last minute\
  \ cancellation to Calicut.\u201D The chugging printer confirmed the passage to a\
  \ new life as she left behind a door key hidden under the flowerpot, some soiled\
  \ dishes in the sink and a devastated father sobbing in his room. \n\nNot that the\
  \ navy blue sleeper berth promised a sound sleep, the clanking wheels of \u201C\
  Shatabdi Express\u201D were able to rouse memories that until now haunted only her\
  \ dreams. \n\n\u201CThe white rose pinned on her birthday dress by the grandmother,\
  \ the dark room she woke up to after every nightmare, the animated folktale recited\
  \ by her grandfather, the lifeless laughter dying ever since, the race to the house\
  \ with her cousins, the lingering footsteps to the hostel, the youth of her father\
  \ and the decay of his sanity.\u201D \n\nTwo days on her own and insanity had already\
  \ taken a liking to her. Distractions arrived as \u201Cpackaged platters, stinking\
  \ toilets, and \"Metamorphosis\" by Franz Kafka until she was finally greeted by\
  \ a new morn nodding in attestation as she announced, \u201CNow I get to write the\
  \ story.\u201D \n\n\u201CSunny afternoons may not be sunny.\u201D she wrote. But,\
  \ there\u2019ll be the starlit night in Thar desert that\u2019ll remind you of the\
  \ beauty that is yet to be seen, the intoxicated stories of sex workers in Bangkok\
  \ that are yet to be heard. And when you least expect it, there'll be that 3 a.m.\
  \ morning illuminated by glowing waves of paradise beach sharing with you the biggest\
  \ secret of life, \u201Cmiracles come upon those who are brave enough to seek.\u201D\
  \na"
