Text: "This self - made, silent, black and white, slow motion movie, often haunts\
  \ me. \n\nToo tall and too heavy for one thin tuk tuk driver to pull us both on\
  \ foot, the movie begins when Lori (colleague and friend from Thammasat University)\
  \ and I, arrived separately at the annual Monkey Festival, ready to celebrate at\
  \ Prang Sam Yot, a 13th century Khmer style temple high on the hill.  The tuk tuk\
  \ driver carefully watched me take my easy-to-find small bright pink purse from\
  \ my light, black, cloth shoulder bag, thoughtfully packed for the occasion.  Passport,\
  \ credit card, 3000 baht, extra memory sticks for my camera, all in one place. \
  \ I paid the driver the fare we agreed upon and tipped him well for physically pulling\
  \ me in his chariot.  A friendly Thai smile appeared on his face.\n\nHundreds of\
  \ the revered macaque monkeys greeted us, anxious to snatch my shiny rimmed eye\
  \ glasses and the food from Lori's visible brown bag.  Heroes and symbols of prosperity\
  \ and good luck, they inhabitant the Pra Prang Sam Yot Buddhist temple and the town\
  \ of Lopburi year around.  The monkeys attract the tourist trade bringing success\
  \ and a better life to the local business owners and residents, so today all gather\
  \ together at this yearly catered event, to \u2018eat, drink and be merry.\u2019\
  \ \n\nAt the opening ceremony, my arms raised high to photograph the brightly colored\
  \ balloons coming down upon us, while what must have been a small sharp thin knife\
  \ is cutting a straight neat four- inch slit into my cloth bag now dangling behind\
  \ my back.  And while the monkeys are playing, picking bugs from their fur and eating\
  \ their colorful buffet, we followed the parade of yellow, white and orange streamers\
  \ toward the center near the large ancient Buddha.  Over the crowd, my name was\
  \ called on the loud speaker.  At the information booth, my bright pink purse void\
  \ of all but my passport and credit card was lying on the small counter waiting\
  \ for me.\n\nLingering now, the perfect \u2018set up\u2019 in slow motion . . .\
  \ . . the tuk tuk driver\u2019s smile; the crowd of locals, tourists and monkeys;\
  \ the balloons; my raised arms; the slit in  my hanging cloth bag; and the final\
  \ unexpected sound of my name."
