Text: "The computer glow illuminated my face as I sat scrolling through different\
  \ operas playing at the Sydney Opera house at two a.m., I was still jet-lagged after\
  \ moving to New Zealand, so I propped myself up in bed and decided to make my New\
  \ Year\u2019s Plans.  My intention had been to go to Sydney and see Carmen for the\
  \ New Year, but I came across an ad that was colorful and piqued my interest. Sydney\
  \ Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras February twelfth through March fifth. I watched videos\
  \ of the parade and instantly decided that was what I was going to go to Sydney\
  \ for.\n    I immediately signed up as a volunteer for the Parade and was directed\
  \ to my parade manager, Frank. Frank and I started communicating on Facebook and\
  \ he eventually invited me to stay with him for the duration of my week and a half.\
  \ Two months later I arrived in sunny Sydney at the end of February. Australia has\
  \ opposite seasons as the US so while my friends back home were getting pelted with\
  \ buckets of snow I was relaxing on the white sandy beaches of Bondi. \n    Frank\
  \ signed me up for a plethora of volunteer opportunities to score me points so that\
  \ I could get into the big volunteer concert party on the last day for free without\
  \ having to buy a ticket at the premium of $150.  The bonus of having these volunteer\
  \ opportunities is that you got access to the event after you finish your shift.\
  \ Thanks to Frank I had the opportunity to go to an Harbour party, a rooftop pool\
  \ party, indie films, and much more. The best one of all was getting front row seats\
  \ for the parade route. \n    The week before the parade was gorgeous and a breezy\
  \ 75-80 degrees but on the day of the parade Mother Nature decided to throw us a\
  \ curve ball. The parade doesn\u2019t start until five o\u2019clock but the volunteers\
  \ have to be there much sooner because patrons are already lining the streets trying\
  \ to get the best view of the parade. The day went by with some cloud cover and\
  \ teasing of rain but as the parade starts so does the rain.  I\u2019m soaked down\
  \ to the bone with lipstick smeared across my cheeks wearing a makeshift poncho\
  \ with hair gel running down the sides of my face and back of the neck as I hand\
  \ out Mardi Gras beads in exchange for kisses on the cheek from patrons. As the\
  \ parade comes to a close all the volunteers start trailing behind waving to the\
  \ patrons as we all walk to the ending spot to get ready to dance the night away\
  \ at our All Night party."
