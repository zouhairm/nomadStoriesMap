Text: "\u201CArmenian and Azerbaijan are enemies more than 20 years\u201D thought\
  \ Aysel, \u201Cwe can\u2019t live with Armen together, even our parents doesn\u2019\
  t assent our engagement\u201D, and I must not keep an appointment with Armen a year\
  \ ago in this border village. And now, I am pregnant, what should I do now, keep\
  \ a child or have an abortion?\u201D. Then she get angry on herself and say loud\
  \ \u201Care you out of your mind, he is your man and you will have a child together\u201D\
  \ add Aysel walking down to Armen\u2019s house in this sunny day. \n\nHer terrible\
  \ thoughts have been disappeared when she sees Armen with admiring smile. Armen\
  \ embrace her and said \u201Chello my darling, I love you more than the entire world\u201D\
  \ and she calm down and melt in his affectionate embrace.  Armen doesn\u2019t tell\
  \ her that 30 minutes ago Azerbaijan\u2019s army has begun to bombard at Armenian\
  \ army locations, and as an answer Armenian army now shooting at civilians of Azerbaijan\
  \ villages and already 20 people from both sides today has been killed. How can\
  \ Armen tell such tragic news to his pregnant wife?  \u201CWhat a damned war, which\
  \ has made enemies to people, who lived friendly many centuries with each other,\
  \ who have made families and children together in these beautiful places\u201D thought\
  \ Armen. \n\nThey sit hugging one another under the unripe apple tree in Armen\u2019\
  s garden and look at the clean sky and fabulous nature of village Aygepar, which\
  \ means garden dance translated from Armenian. \u201CWhat will be with us, with\
  \ our child\u201D asked Aysel. \u201CEverything will be good, don\u2019t worry\u201D\
  \ answered Armen with hesitant voice, \u201Cthe war will end soon, I have heard\
  \ in news\u201D adds he. Although nobody knows when the war will be ended after\
  \ hundreds of dead bodies, hate and animosity. \u201CWe can even go and live in\
  \ other country; we will even be accepted as political refugees. The world is open\
  \ for us. That\u2019s why don\u2019t think about that, now the most important things\
  \ are your health and our child. Thankfully to god you both are healthy\u201D said\
  \ Armen with firm and glad tone of voice. \n\n\u201CBut how we can leave our houses,\
  \ our parents, relatives, our birthplace, our motherland\u201D continued Aysel with\
  \ blaming voice looking at Armen handsome face. What should Armen answered? His\
  \ heart aches and bleeds too. Only life can find answers to these questions. \u201C\
  Our love, our family is stronger than this disgusting war and artificial hate between\
  \ our nations, we will survive, god is with us\u201D said Armen. Armen look at the\
  \ pretty brown eyes of Aysel and kiss her in lips."
