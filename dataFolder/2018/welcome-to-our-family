Text: "I say to myself, \u201CThis looks about it,\u201D as I take a right off of\
  \ the circumventing highway on Koh Samui to head up into the mountains in search\
  \ of the Secret Buddha Garden. Avoiding disaster on the road is part of the excitement,\
  \ but now I\u2019m happy to be scaling a palm tree covered foothill in search of\
  \ this magically-sounding place. Fewer and fewer motorbikes appear as I travel up\
  \ and deeper into the range, all while catching glimpses of an elephant sanctuary\
  \ and viewpoints that help make you forget about the one you just passed. \n I feel\
  \ close as I top the ridge and enter a high valley with farms and tourist-less fruit\
  \ shake stands; a telltale sign that the attraction exists only for the willing.\
  \ After passing a few painted wooden posts encouraging me to keep going, I arrive\
  \ in a small gravel lot where the fee for the Garden is 25baht. Perfect, I\u2019\
  ll take a day pass and a mango shake for recovery, so 75baht.\n A welcoming staircase\
  \ of over 50 steps took me down into what felt like a family reunion retreat in\
  \ the middle of the forest, complete with two gentle waterfalls at opposing ends\
  \ and their feeding river running right through the middle of the grounds. To my\
  \ right are two stone housing units that are displayable but not habitable, and\
  \ as I continue to walk and observe, the entire scene comes to life. Below my feet\
  \ are stone carvings of turtles and fish, next to a shelter is a tiger, and in certain\
  \ stages of the Garden there are human figurines that hinted at relatedness.\n The\
  \ further I traveled from the entrance staircase, the more royal the scene felt.\
  \ Then with reverse attendance in an amphitheater came a depiction of a royal figure\
  \ at the top with lesser decorated attendees seated below him, all armed with either\
  \ weapons or instruments. There also stood a large stone bird with a snake in its\
  \ beak, and before leaving the Garden at the bottom end stood a Giant with a club\
  \ resting on his shoulder. \u201CSafety,\u201D I said. At that point I look up and\
  \ see two other figurines just outside of what was understood as the \u201Cmain\
  \ attraction.\u201D \n Standing between two trees and looking directly at the top\
  \ royal figure were most likely his parents and they were staring and smiling at\
  \ him from across and outside the Garden. After seeing that I felt connected to\
  \ it all, and no matter where I stood in the Garden, a figurine was watching me.\
  \ This was a loving family, and his parents with one arm around each other were\
  \ looking back at him saying, \u201CSee honey, he\u2019s safe.\u201D"
