Text: "As soon as the warm sweet Moroccan air filed my lungs when I stepped out of\
  \ the plane, I knew there was magic in this place. This was the furthest I had ever\
  \ traveled from home and the environmental differences were already blindingly apparent.\
  \ Literally blinding, I\u2019d never seen the sun so bright, it made the dusty ground\
  \ sparkle in such a captivating way I nearly tripped over my own feet!\n\u2018This\
  \ is it\u2019 I\u2019d thought to myself at that exact moment, I\u2019d traveled\
  \ thousands of miles away from home, totally alone. I could feel my stomach starting\
  \ to fill up with emotion. The familiar sensation of anxiety starting to rise like\
  \ the heat waves rising over the dusty horizon that lay ahead of me. But this time\
  \ it was different. This time \u2013 I reminded myself - I was in control. The anxiety\
  \ started to fade, it was being pushed out by a calm excitement which was beginning\
  \ to light up the path of my adventure ahead, just as the sun was for my two left\
  \ feet. \n\nAfter having lived through some rather traumatic events in the last\
  \ few years of my life I\u2019d developed an anxiety that became so intense it took\
  \ over my world entirely and had stopped me from living. For a long time, my whole\
  \ existence had been spent watching time between four walls which I learned to dependently\
  \ despise.\nExactly three months ago, I woke up that morning and knew a decision\
  \ had to be made. I could either carry on living in the safety of my numb, routine,\
  \ predictable existence, or, I could break the cycle with an act of courage,\nNow,\
  \ I realise booking a trip to the Sahara dessert, to sleep in one of the most humanly\
  \ hostile environments on the planet, just to see what the night sky truly looks\
  \ like is a rather extreme comfort zone to tackle. But when you\u2019ve been pushed\
  \ to the edge in life and have encountered extreme isolation, I figured that maybe\
  \ the best rope to pull myself firmly back onto the ground was a rope made of equal\
  \ measure. Bringing a dream to life, now that really is an extreme. Most people\
  \ go their entire lives without living their dreams. I decided that day that I would\
  \ not be one of those people.\n\nAs my eyes and stomach finally adjusted to my new\
  \ surroundings I took one last deep breath, filling my lungs with all that I needed\
  \ to treasure this perfect moment. Taking one last look around at the starting point\
  \ of my adventure I caught eyes with a young Moroccan woman, she smiled softly at\
  \ me and I knew I was ok. \n\nThe Sahara was calling and I wasn\u2019t going to\
  \ keep it waiting any longer."
