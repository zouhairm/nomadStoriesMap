Text: "\"You're not a real Cuban if you can't dance\" someone said to me on my first\
  \ day in colourful and vibrant Havana.\nThe sounds of wind instruments, drums and\
  \ singing were everywhere. In every bar, restaurant and street corner and you could\
  \ not resist the urge to dance.\nVenues like La Musica where the locals party is\
  \ the perfect place to watch dancers, bands and try out your best salsa moves. I\
  \ was given a few dance lessons by willing men who could clearly see I was not local\
  \ with my slightly rigid and uncertain moves. \nThe night had been recommended by\
  \ my casa host, Maria Elena. \nHer house was in the heart of Old Havana and as my\
  \ taxi took me down a dark, derelict street I had questioned whether staying in\
  \ someone's house had been the safest choice. But once inside, her house was amazing\
  \ and not what I had expected at all.\nBy morning I stood on the balcony from her\
  \ lounge overlooking the street below and it felt completely different. It was buzzing,\
  \ full of people greeting their neighbours and cars driving up and down. \nMaria\
  \ Elena spoke little English but with my limited Spanish and generic hand gestures\
  \ we got by. She gave me tips on what to see and do. Where to eat. Where to party.\_\
  She thought I was crazy travelling around Havana on my own and she looked after\
  \ me. Breakfast was prepared fresh at the same time everyday and while I felt like\
  \ I was intruding in her home, it was homely and welcoming.\nOn Friday night she\
  \ was going to La Musica just around the corner.\n\"You have to go to the party,\"\
  \ she said. She invited me to go with her friends but I politely declined and said\
  \ I would see her there. \nI arrived there early not realising Cubans rarely stick\
  \ to times advertised. But I wasn't the only one. Three other girls from Europe\
  \ were as confused as me.  They asked me to join them at a table and we chatted\
  \ over a rum and coke until the room was full around us.  \nOnce the entertainment\
  \ started, the atmosphere was incredible. The music was loud, people sang along\
  \ and it wasn't\_long before I was joining in with the group dances, still envious\
  \ at the women who moved their hips and feet so beautifully and effortlessly. As\
  \ I tried my best to copy them men would grab me and direct me through the moves.\
  \ They certainly weren't shy and loved to show off their dancing ability. \nThanks\
  \ to Maria Elena's recommendation I had enjoyed one of my favourite nights in Havana.\
  \ They say dance is good for the soul, but mix it with friendly Cubans and you have\
  \ a very happy soul."
