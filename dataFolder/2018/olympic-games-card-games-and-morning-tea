Text: "During a 23-hour layover in South Korea, freezing temperatures and a lack of\
  \ winter gear narrowed my search for a place closer to the airport, where I found\
  \ a guest house a short distance from the subway station.\n\nAfter a warm greeting\
  \ and a quick tour from my hostess, I asked if she thought a trip into Seoul was\
  \ worth braving the elements, being a Saturday night (and my last on vacation before\
  \ returning home).\n\n\u201COh, no,\u201D she replied, \u201Cit's much too cold,\
  \ and most people will be at home watching the Olympics. You should come down to\
  \ the kitchen and watch with us.\u201D \n\nWe seated ourselves downstairs, where\
  \ half a dozen others watched as the women's speed skating commenced. She explained\
  \ this was a strong sport for Korea, and we all cheered as they took match after\
  \ match. As a language lover, I looked up the phrase for \u201Cvery good\u201D in\
  \ Korean: aju joh-a.\n\nI repeated the phrase after another successful run for the\
  \ Korean team, much to my hostess' delight, and thus started this sport where we\
  \ went back and forth with our phones' translation app, filling in the conversation\
  \ blanks when words were met with trying faces.\n\nA few hours later, as my attention\
  \ span waned, she mentioned this card game, Godori (Go Stop), using hwatu\u2014\
  flower cards\u2014that she played with a guest the week before for nearly four hours.\
  \ Seeing my intrigue, she ushered me upstairs to play.\n\nThree hours and 27 games\
  \ later, I conceded to both my hostess and to sleep, as she took the tie-breaker\
  \ with her 14th win. She thanked me for the competitive and entertaining match and\
  \ apologized for being a late riser. I assured her I would stick around for a proper\
  \ send-off, having an evening flight and zero plans.\n\nMid-morning the next day,\
  \ she invited me to participate in a traditional Korean tea ceremony. I graciously\
  \ accepted, and met her back in the kitchen. She explained we were drinking Korean\
  \ green tea\u2014otherwise known as Panyaro tea, had to let it steep for three minutes,\
  \ and would each receive three cups, the second being the most flavorful.\n\nAfterwards,\
  \ we both shared how blessed we were to have met the other, and chatted about lifestyles,\
  \ gratitude, and mindfulness for an hour past my checkout time, at which point I\
  \ politely excused myself. Neither of us wanted to leave... but then, that's often\
  \ the best way to leave, and I headed to the airport having made one last\u2014\
  and lasting\u2014connection on my soulful, spontaneous three weeks through Southeast\
  \ Asia, planned one day at a time."
