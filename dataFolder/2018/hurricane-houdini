Text: "Entering the confines of the gas station store felt especially odd.\n \nThe\
  \ lunar landscapes surrounding it \u2013 the red canyons, the spray-painted greens,\
  \ the desert teasing rivers of Zion \u2013 were a world apart from these stifling\
  \ shelves of rainbow candy and beef jerky.\n\nEven before Jay Patel said \u201C\
  Hello!\u201D, I felt sorry for him.\n\nI had met many Jay Patels before.\n\nFirst\
  \ gen South Asian immigrants, with the American Dream writ large in their eyes,\
  \ toiling through, stuck - day after day, year after year \u2013 homesick behind\
  \ dreary counters, at motels, restaurants and convenience stores.\n\nWhile I, a\
  \ fellow Indian, on a temporary US deputation under a tolerant boss, solo-tripped\
  \ from Alaska to Key West, checking off one by one, all of my American travel fantasies.\n\
  \nOn that purple evening in Hurricane, Utah, my guilt & geographical kinship, yet\
  \ again, compelled conversation.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s beautiful around here!\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CBeautiful?! Yes. But Addis Ababa was my town.\u201D\n\nI took a visual\
  \ check. Jay, bespectacled, snowy hair on a slight frame. Nothing to suggest senility.\n\
  \n\u201CYes. Addis.\u201D he spoke, mind reading \u201CMy first shop after leaving\
  \ India.\u201D\n\nEthiopia! Grasslands with red bottomed baboons, source of the\
  \ Blue Nile, inspiration for Bob Marley \u2013 what little I knew of it was fantastic\
  \ enough. Canned sardines no longer had my attention.\n\n\u201CBut\u2026 but\u2026\
  \ but\u201D, I stumbled headlong into 'good' dictators and active volcanoes.\n\n\
  Then recently deceased strongman Meles Zenawi had kept Jay and Ethiopia safe from\
  \ mayhem. In all of the whole wide world, Ethiopia was Jay\u2019s happy place. The\
  \ Danakil Depression, in whose boiling world only microbes aptly named extremophiles\
  \ survive, was the \u2018real\u2019 alien landscape, Jay added.\n\nJay had only\
  \ begun. From Ethiopia, he had moved - out to the sunny hills of Tuscany, onto the\
  \ foggy moors of North Yorkshire. His children\u2019s education made his shop hop\
  \ again, across the pond to the academic meccas on the US East Coast. Now with his\
  \ kids all settled, his itchy feet had brought him out to the vastness of Utah.\n\
  \n\u201CI loved it here but it\u2019s time\u2026\u201D he tantalized.\n\nWhat...\
  \ what next?\n\n\u201CSouth America looks good\u2026 Peru? Venezuela, maybe?\u201D\
  \n\nI left Jay\u2019s store in a daze, his pencil scrawled e-mail ID clutched in\
  \ hand.\n\nI felt sorry for myself \u2013 for my slaughtered sense of superiority.\n\
  \nI kept looking back, half expecting the store and gas station to disappear with\
  \ a poof.\n\nIt stayed put, that strange little shop\u2026 under the starry Utah\
  \ sky, a magic beacon for anonymous adventure."
