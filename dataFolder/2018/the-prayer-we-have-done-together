Text: "It was midnight, with a crescent moon and dark starless sky. I celebrated new\
  \ year in the subway on the route to the shrine. It was my first experience of the\
  \ new year in Japan. My friends murmuring downheartedly. It was already a new year\
  \ and we were far from home, but we were stuck in a subway, really?\n\nThere were\
  \ several Japanese people riding the subway with us. From the looks of it, they\
  \ looked fine and didn\u2019t mind celebrating new year in a subway for a while.\
  \ Maybe because they were used to it or maybe because of the shouganai mentality\
  \ that has long deeply internalized in the Japanese society. If you cannot help\
  \ it, then do not dwell over it. Quietly comforting for a strenuous mind.  Accepting\
  \ the fate was never meant to surrender.\n\nOne of the Japanese girls who wore light\
  \ brown coat and light igari makeup were looking at us. \u201CHappy new year!\u201D\
  \ she said with accented English. Several others looked at us warmly. There were\
  \ no words. But somehow, the meaning filled the air and caught me of understanding.\
  \ Turn out it only took a split second of warm bonding with strangers to mend the\
  \ disappointed feeling. \n\nJapan was quietly strange yet beautiful. \n\nAfter getting\
  \ off, we were greeted by an overcrowded mass along the road to the Hokkaido shrine.\
  \ It was like all people in Sapporo were coming here to perform hatsumode or first\
  \ shrine visit of the year. It reminded me of home. Walking to the Eid prayer place\
  \ together with a lot of people. It was crowded but calming. It almost felt like\
  \ I walked with the subtle sense of familiarity.\n\nThe coldness was beyond words,\
  \ but everything was so vividly pleasant. The smell of wood, the piling snow on\
  \ the tip of every edge, the hazy cloud of every breath, and the same rhythm of\
  \ people\u2019s steps. Then we paused and embracing the silence. Listened to the\
  \ quiet. The people in front of me, they began to pray so earnestly. Eyes closed\
  \ so tight. Hands clasped together like a knot. It was me afterward. I could feel\
  \ their eyes on me. Maybe because I was a foreigner or maybe because I was a foreigner\
  \ who wore a hijab. Still, it was a fleeting moment of serenity. Quite surprisingly,\
  \ I sensed a sheer of gratitude.  Experiencing the culture, I began to learn that\
  \ prayer is a universal language. At last, in the midst of crowded foreign amity\
  \ and icy cold scenery, I caught a glimpse of tranquil familiarity."
