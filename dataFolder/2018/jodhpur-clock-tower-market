Text: "The balloon sellers smile, amidst the cacophony of the tinkling bells of the\
  \ cycle rikshaws, the loud haggling of the street vendors, and the mooing of the\
  \ possibly frightened cows, possibly finding their way home. She wonders why she\
  \ is being photographed. The 9 year old balloon seller pulls her 5 year old assistant\
  \ along, desperate to sell me a couple of colourful balloons. Their excitement is\
  \ palpable when I hand them two glasses of cold lassi- they become children again.\
  \ Their \u2018mother\u2019 is furious; she slaps them both- twice. A glass of lassi\
  \ is not making her any money; they rush off with their wet eyes as bait for the\
  \ group of American tourists, leaving me to feel helpless. She looked back at me\
  \ fleetingly, wiping her tears, mischievous glint back in her eye, a half smile,\
  \ and a full spoon of lassi in her hungry mouth, before she disappears-lost in the\
  \ chaos.\n\nA closer look at the street vendors, and I meet a breastfeeding single\
  \ mother, tenderly clutching her infant close, while the other hand displays the\
  \ strength of a sharp negotiator. Time is money, she says. She is unsure of who\
  \ the father of her child is; a dark past that we don\u2019t venture into. Of one\
  \ thing she is certain; an education, and a bright future for her baby girl. Her\
  \ determination to live life on her own terms, and to live to fight another day\
  \ is sure to give us a strong young woman one day.\n\nOn my way back, away from\
  \ the chaos of the clock tower market, the rikshaw driver tells me a story that\
  \ sends my mind into utter chaos. \nA story of the Udaipur Royals: pressurizing\
  \ his family into leaving their homes, to make way for luxury developers.\nA story\
  \ of the illiterate: manipulated by politicians & Royals to riot against the release\
  \ of a film. (Apparently, it portrays in bad light, the Rajastani Royals from the\
  \ 1400s)\nA story of his friends and loved ones: who went missing or got hurt in\
  \ the riots.\nA story of the same politicians: who now claim the movie glorifies\
  \ Rajput past, & so lifts the ban on its release in the state.\nI wonder, what about\
  \ the lives lost, the critically injured? Don\u2019t poor lives matter? Being Illiterate\
  \ can really be fatal in India.\n\nI came back from Jodhpur refreshed and with a\
  \ new perspective on everything I see around me. The people of Jodhpur have made\
  \ me question the ordinary, to find the extraordinary lying deep within."
