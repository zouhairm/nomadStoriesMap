Text: "For years I heard speak of my grandmother and therefore me being direct bloodline\
  \ to Livingstone. The African tour I chose included visiting Livingstone\u2019s\
  \ statue and Victoria Falls in Zimbabwe\u2019s. I embarked apon my adventure with\
  \ love and adventure in my heart.\nSpring of 2013 my tour arrived in Zimbabwe, we\
  \ pitched our burlap tents in a campground walking distance from Victoria Falls.\n\
  Throughout Africa I braved long walks on my own, braving the African sand dunes,\
  \ ocean shores and now Zimbabwaes touristy yet wild African jungle and plains. My\
  \ first day I braved a walk encountering many grey monkeys and met a local boy named\
  \ King who offered to walk with me. \nWe walked past the gates to Victoria Falls\
  \ that my alleged ancestor once visited.  We also walked to the biggest tree in\
  \ Africa the Babao tree. We began to walk back to the gates of Victoria Falls that\
  \ the African natives actually named Cloud that Thunders and a heard of elephants\
  \ walked in front of us crossing the road from the woods near the river feeding\
  \ into Waterfall on the opposite side. I was ecstatic as all through Africa I loved\
  \ seeing the wild elephant herds. My bones craved taming a wild elephant myself!\n\
  The last elephant, a large male, did not turn into the woods with the other elephants,\
  \ it instead began to run towards us! My spirit was ecstatic, my prayer manifesting,\
  \ perhaps my ancestors spirit! Then, my new local friend King said, \u201C Run!\
  \ Elephant trampoling!\u201D And he took off running down the road opposite of the\
  \ direction we were headed. Surprised , I took off running after him. A few yards\
  \ I was a bit winded from running and firmly decided I was not going to be able\
  \ to out run a wild elephant. In my mind I began to spin fire, a form of psychic\
  \ self defense. I also yelled ahead to King if he would take take a picture of it.\
  \ He turned and turned again, agreeing. My mind rapidly found new solutions to what\
  \ was about to be the best then worst moments of my life.\nKing took two photos\
  \ of me and our trampling elephant friend. One of me in the middle of the road and\
  \ one as I crossed the road with the slowing elephant behind me. Capturing our amazing\
  \ wild African experience.\nPrayers and mental work can certainly change outcomes\
  \ and save lives! We both relaxed to the elephant joining its family, looked at\
  \ a few other monkeys and made it safely out of the wild danger zone. He walked\
  \ me back to the more populated village area and agreed to meet up with me later."
