Text: "\u201CWhat happens if you get horribly lost?\u201D \u201CWhat if you get super\
  \ sick or hurt yourself?!\u201D \u201CWhat if you lose your passport or your money?\u201D\
  \ \u201COr if you don't have a good time and get lonely?\"...The voices of self-doubt\
  \ that resonated within my comfort zone shouted loudly in my head as the mouse hovered\
  \ over the \u201CConfirm Purchase\u201D button on my computer screen. With sweaty\
  \ palms and a racing heart, I sat there trying hard not to listen to my own inner\
  \ dialogue.\n\n\u201CBut what if...\u201D\n\n*Click*\n\n    I couldn't believe it.\
  \ What was I doing?! It would be my first time traveling solo abroad. With no idea\
  \ of what to expect, I had stubbornly settled on going all in. Why, if this is a\
  \ trip of many firsts, then I have to embrace them all, I told myself. The date\
  \ was set, and the plan was...well, honestly, there was no plan. With just a small\
  \ carry-on backpack, my passport, and all the courage I could muster, I set off\
  \ on the soul-searching adventure I had been dreaming of for years.\n\n    It wasn't\
  \ until I was walking out of the doors of the airport in Lisbon, Portugal that reality\
  \ finally fully washed over it.\n\nThis was it.\n\nThis was my time.\n\n    The\
  \ October air felt warm and inviting against my face as I noticed a different kind\
  \ of smile slowly spread across it. All of my anxieties seemed to have no place\
  \ here, and the once self-doubting inner chatter was replaced with boisterous words\
  \ of excitement and encouragement! I felt energized in a way that was as foreign\
  \ to me as the languages that filled the space around me.\n\n    After a long day\
  \ of travel, I began my trek up the seven flights of stairs to the very top floor\
  \ of the building to my Airbnb, swearing to myself that next time I would pack even\
  \ lighter. The lights for the stairwell weren't working, so I ascended in total\
  \ darkness with just the flashlight from my phone to guide me. I knocked on the\
  \ bright green wooden door labeled \u201CSurfer House\u201D once I reached the top\
  \ and, (a couple of short-breathed-seconds later) I was greeted by my host, a friendly\
  \ young man named Paulo. \n\n\u201CYou made it!\u201D He cheerfully exclaimed in\
  \ his accented English. And in more ways than one, I had.\n\n    I spent the next\
  \ two weeks hopping trains and making friends along the way, never truly alone.\
  \ Catching early morning sunrises was the norm, and mundane \u201CHey, how are you?\u201D\
  \ pleasantries were no longer my go-to greeting.\n\nEach day discovering more silent\
  \ victories.\n\nEach day proving to myself just how capable and independent I really\
  \ am."
