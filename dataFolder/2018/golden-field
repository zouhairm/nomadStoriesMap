Text: "It was a polar day, four o'clock, sticky fog exaggerated noticeable cold. A\
  \ field was surrounded by majestic, grim fiords. Even thou we were in the valley\
  \ of great acoustic, nature was stubbornly silent, neither a sea sound nor a tweet.\
  \ That raw landscape was the background  of the real \"human race\". Competitors\
  \ were dressed in enormous gum suits twisting their bodies. They were frustrated\
  \ because the season was almost over. Main judge - frigid, acquisitive farmer made\
  \ a speech in the fragmentary English: Rotten strawberry NO! Wet strawberry NO!\
  \ Eat strawberry NO! After he read numbers of rows as they were racetracks, competitors\
  \ launched unconsciously to their positions getting on their knees into the mud.\n\
  \ In the first orders worked sisters, veterans of field work. With the speed of\
  \ machines they were dipping their numb fingers inside the strawberry shrubs and\
  \ filling up the baskets with fruits. Further picked a women destroyed by years\
  \ spent on this field, wicked and hated. She were stealing bigger strawberries from\
  \ others shrubs. In the silence full of tension, fuming, not saying a word pickers\
  \ rushed in their rows. Ecstatic scream disturbed it. Women around her sixties had\
  \ full basket and started to run. BUM! Fell down and strawberries dumped on the\
  \ mud. Meanwhile she was trying to save as much fruits as she could, somebody run\
  \ over them to reach the weighting point. Farmer was commenting the content of baskets\
  \ : rotten, bad, minus one kilo. Became visible how unlucky guys tried to make good\
  \ their losses hiding big rotten strawberries in their baskets. \n Fog rose and\
  \ sun was heating the gum costumes. Fifteen minutes of break because till eleven\
  \ strawberries have to reach shops. Humble meal consisted pasta with an instant\
  \ sauce. Even during the break everybody let their eyes follow nervously the field\
  \ in order to detect fruits. Conversations initiated by them were related always\
  \ to strawberries: how many kilos, its ripping - off, for sure next year they will\
  \ not come here again. Later, somewhere took place an argument, somebody was caught\
  \ eating strawberries, farmer got mad.\nFinally after almost fourteen hours of marathon,\
  \ while farmer were driving away systematically with thousands of kilos of strawberries,\
  \ competitors were finally slowly coming down from the field. Women who has very\
  \ sick son in Poland said deeply satisfied \"I earned around 35 Euros today, but\
  \ tomorrow I'll try better\". Till today I cannot believe how the strawberry can\
  \ alter a man."
