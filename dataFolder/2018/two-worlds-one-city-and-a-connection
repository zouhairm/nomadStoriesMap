Text: "I lived a secluded life in the comfort of my surroundings. I grew up in a quiet\
  \ street, with modern homes which occupied your average family of 4. I was accustomed\
  \ to the beauty of Cape Town, its bluest beaches and fancy bistro\u2019s. When I\
  \ started studying, I made friends from all walks of life. After getting to know\
  \ a few of them intimately, I had realized how out of touch I was with people and\
  \ how they lived. I began questioning everything I had known and came to the decision\
  \ that I would explore my city for all its glory. I was apprehensive about what\
  \ to expect but I wanted to gain knowledge and experiences and I refused to turn\
  \ back. I had read up on the \u2018Cape Flats\u2019 which came about in the 1950\u2019\
  s under the apartheid era. It was areas specifically laid out for non-white people.\
  \ These areas were home to low-income earning families and were infested with violence,\
  \ drugs and gangster activity. My friend, Quinton who lived in Lavender Hill offered\
  \ to be my tour guide. It was not home. Run down flats, houses that gave off the\
  \ effect that they were built on top of one another, make shift washing lines and\
  \ plenty of people walking in the street and sitting on corners. When I got to Quinton\u2019\
  s home we immediately set off for a walk around the neighborhood. While we walked\
  \ my eyes wondered around. It caught the attention of a girl who looked like she\
  \ was in her late teens. Neatly dressed, her hair tied in a bun, sitting on the\
  \ steps of an orange painted house with broken fencing and windows. We made eye\
  \ contact and she smiled, I took this as an invitation to introduce myself. Her\
  \ name was Layla, an 18-year-old resident who grew up in Lavender Hill her whole\
  \ life. We got to talking and I explained to her that I was trying to gain personal\
  \ knowledge outside of the way I live. She began telling me her story. She lived\
  \ in a single parent household with her mom and younger brother; her father had\
  \ been jailed for possession of drugs. She recently finished school and was looking\
  \ for work to help support her mom. At eighteen, I had no worry or care. My only\
  \ worry was the outfit I was going to wear to a party. I made a connection with\
  \ Layla. I was taken aback by how she smiled through our whole exchange and how\
  \ humbled she was under her circumstance. I realized how privileged I am in my own\
  \ comfort, how shocking it was that I did not realize my very own privilege and\
  \ how one beautiful place can be worlds apart from the poverty and living conditions\
  \ many people experience."
