Text: "July 2017. Sulawesi Island. Toraja. I took my tea in the morning, accompanied\
  \ by the roe of a refreshing rain. Without really knowing how and why, I put on\
  \ my backpack, and I started in a direction that only my feet knew. It did not take\
  \ me long to reach a wide field of rice where, as if from the ground, there were\
  \ some traditional wood-carved cottages with huge boat-shaped roofs, painted in\
  \ bright colors that couldn't avoid to marvel your eye. In the field at their center,\
  \ boulders were lifted, creating a mysterious atmosphere, as pictures from a magazine\
  \ with druid ruins. On one of the stones, a calf was tied. I didn't find anything\
  \ strange about it. I had no way of knowing what fate was awaiting him. I was getting\
  \ close to the animal. He was looking at something extremely profound, in a peaceful\
  \ way. I only had a book and an apple in my backpack. I gave him the apple, which\
  \ he was quick to bark and leaned down, gratefully. I sat down beside him and took\
  \ out my book. He was playing, and he gave me crazy tails as far as the chain allowed\
  \ him. It was late, and I had to go to the hotel. I returned to Sedikit (\u201D\
  little\u201D in Indonesian), as I had baptized him in three days. Meanwhile, more\
  \ oxen were added to it, bound to boulders. I brought apples to Sedikit every day\
  \ I stayed there, and I was trying to chase the flies that were hooting him, and\
  \ he was looking at me, having something in his gaze that I was not even distinguishing.\
  \ It was the day I had to leave. One of the locals told me that there was going\
  \ to be a funeral ceremony, which is considered a real attraction. I could not miss\
  \ such a thing. There was a lot of people. Dressed in traditional costumes, doing\
  \ ritual dances, accompanied by macabre and sinister chops and screams. I approached\
  \ the calf that became my friend. Suddenly I had heard a resounding thunder. I turned\
  \ my head and saw that one of the oxen, with his stabbed throat, fell to the ground\
  \ and struggled. I was not the only one who saw that. Sedikit also saw him. He was\
  \ crying. So that's why he was here. He had to be sacrificed because the tradition\
  \ said that the animal's soul would help the soul of human to pass into the afterlife.\
  \ I could not help him, and his desperate image made me cry. He knew what he was\
  \ waiting for. That was in his eyes. A question for help. A cry for justice. We\
  \ could not help him. I gave him the last apple and I left, because I do not think\
  \ I could watch them killing him. His gaze was forever engraved in my soul..."
