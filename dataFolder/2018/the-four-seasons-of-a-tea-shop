Text: "On an Autumn day, on the campus of Beijing Language and Culture University,\
  \ fallen leaves crunched under my feet, as I darted toward the on-campus tea shop.\
  \ My stomach filled with anticipation of what varieties of tea I would find inside.\
  \ The sounds of bicycle bells rang in my ears, motor scooters inched through the\
  \ crowd, and multilingual chatter filled the air. I arrived at the teashop door;\
  \ disappointment filled my stomach as I pulled on the locked sliding door. As started\
  \ to leave, a voice boomed from the nearby convenient store telling someone that\
  \ I am here.  Xiao Yue, a petite woman, emerged with a bright smile, as she anxiously\
  \ opened the door.  I am greeted by the fresh aroma of tea leaves; glass shelves\
  \ adorned with a drum-like metal tin filled with tea. With my novice level of Chinese,\
  \ I purchased fragrant jasmine green tea and an earthy red tea. Xiao Yue gave me\
  \ a small gift of a rare pu\u2019er tea and the friendship of a local. \n In Winter,\
  \ during the Chinese New Year, I gathered my courage and returned to the tea shop.\
  \ This time, I met Taylor, a Chinese language teacher and a friend of Xiao Yue.\
  \ We conversed in Chinese and English as Xiao Yue poured cups of tea.  As we talked,\
  \ Taylor invited me to dinner at a \u201Csecret\u201D restaurant on campus nestled\
  \ behind the workers living quarters on campus and known to few foreigners. As we\
  \ entered, the restaurant engulfed us in the scent of cigarette smoke and cooking\
  \ oil. I ordered Kung Pao Jiding, a sweet and spicy dish of rice, peanuts, chilies,\
  \ and diced chicken. As we parted ways, I realized how a decision to visit Xiao\
  \ Yue deepened my ties to the community. \nIn the Spring, I stopped at the tea shop\
  \ and found Xiao Yue talking with two women who were smoking cigarettes and watching\
  \ Chinese dramas. To my surprise, they were the cashiers at the convenience store,\
  \ the voices I heard my first visit to the tea shop. I introduced myself, and the\
  \ cashiers asked how to translate Chinese words into English. The shop filled with\
  \ laughter, and at that moment, I realized the power of language to connect people\
  \ across cultural barriers.\nIn the Summer, before my return home, I made a final\
  \ purchase from Xiao Yue\u2019s shop. For the first time, I conversed with Xiao\
  \ Yue without a translator.  Before my departure, she thanked me for being a good\
  \ customer and friend.  Xiao Yue, in her way, taught me I realized that that tea\
  \ is not only a drink but a leaf that creates friendships and unites cultures one\
  \ cup at a time."
