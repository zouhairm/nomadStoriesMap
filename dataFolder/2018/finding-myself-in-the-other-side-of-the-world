Text: "A few hours ago I arrived at this national park, the one that the girl at the\
  \ tourist office in Phang Nga recommended to me. The area of \u200B\u200BPhang Nga\
  \ is beautiful, surrounded by huge limestone mountains and hills, covered with vegetation.\
  \ I stopped here by chance; I was on my way to Krabi, but the truck driver that\
  \ picked me up stopped here, and I was already marveling at the beauty of the place\
  \ through the window, so I considered it a sign that my driver stopped here and\
  \ I decided to explore the area. After buying provisions for the night I headed\
  \ to the national park. I hitchhiked a very kind man on a motorcycle; when he stopped\
  \ he called someone on the phone and handed it to me, since he could not speak any\
  \ English and he wasn\xB4t sure about what I needed. I arrived at the park and approached\
  \ some guys who seemed to work there. I told them that I wanted to sleep there and\
  \ one of them answered \"Yes, sure! Pitch your tent wherever you want, just don\xB4\
  t go too far into the jungle, snakes come out at night.\" I love how easy-going\
  \  people is in Thailand, everything works smooth and simple. So I went inside and\
  \ found a nice little waterfall, with some pools to take a bath, and flat areas\
  \ which seemed perfect to pitch my tent. There was also a small shelter with a roof,\
  \ which was very helpful when it started raining just a little after I arrived.\
  \ When it stopped I hurried to set up my little house so that I could leave everything\
  \ ready just in case of more rain, and I had a shower in the pool of the waterfall,\
  \ accompanied by the bites of the fishes who seemed to enjoy my legs. I loved spending\
  \ the night here, alone in the middle of this rain forest, with all the noises of\
  \ the jungle, the sound of the water continuously falling, and nothing but nature\
  \ around me. At night I lay on my back inside the tent, with the door open and I\
  \ began to see all the fireflies flying with their blinking light, which shone so\
  \ brightly in the darkness of the night. You could only see a little bit of the\
  \ clarity of the stars high in the distance, where the towering trees of the jungle\
  \ ended, but everything around me was completely black, interrupted only by those\
  \ little bugs of yellowish light. I felt so lucky to be here, in the midst of this\
  \ beauty. And I also felt proud to have the courage to be there alone, without fear,\
  \ or loneliness, or afraid of darkness or anything at all. I felt more alive than\
  \ ever, and with all the possibilities of the world opened right in front of me."
