Text: "\u201CBhaijaan, be a little careful.\u201D said Ahmed calmly as I tripped on\
  \ hundreds of sandals kept outside the Dargah. Ahmed was a feeble 8 year old boy\
  \ who was appointed to do the mighty task of protecting everyone\u2019s footwear.\n\
  \n\u201CChotejaan, will you not get me the best spot today?\u201D I asked.\n\nHe\
  \ laughed and asked me to follow him.\n\nIn the hustle bustle of busy streets of\
  \ Old Delhi, stands the mighty shrine of Saint Nizammuddin. If Old Delhi is the\
  \ new exciting episode of \u2018Westworld\u2019, then Nizamuddin Dargah is your\
  \ old familiar FRIENDS mischief.\n\n\u201CBhaijaan, I found a space for you\u201D\
  \ Ahmed draws my attention towards him as I am lost in the fragrance of thousands\
  \ of flowers spread all over. Hues of green all around with a red floor full of\
  \ roses.\n\nI met Ahmed when I went to the Dargah first time a few months back.\
  \ We went for tea once Qawali finished.\n\n\u201CDo you want some biscuits with\
  \ your tea?\u201D\n\u201CYes, Bhaijaan\u201D he said shyly.\n\u201CWhich one?\u201D\
  \n\u201CParle G, obviously.\u201D\n\nHe became my best friend at the Dargah over\
  \ the next few months.\n\n\u201CMaati ke tum deeware\nJo sunyo hamri baat\u201D\n\
  \nAhmed quickly signals me to stay silent as Qawali starts.\n\nThis is what I live\
  \ for, I think to myself when all my senses take a hit of dopamine as soon as Qawali\
  \ starts: the soothing air on my skin, the flower petals weaving their magi, the\
  \ innocence on Ahmed\u2019s face and Qawali.\n\nAll the deadlines and pending bills\
  \ seem so small when I see how happy the little Shehzada is in the moment. I forget\
  \ about my worries as my body gets a sudden urge to sing along now that I know the\
  \ song.\n\n\u201CKhusro rain suhaag ki so main jaagi pi ke sang\nTan mora man peehu\
  \ ka\nTan mora man peehu ka so donon ek hi rang\u201D\n\nMy friends ask me why I\
  \ go to Dargah every weekend and I never had a clear answer. However, in that moment,\
  \ I knew.\n\nIt was because I do not have to force my body to sing along; because\
  \ I do not have to act happy; because nothing is more pure; because Ahmed.\n\nMy\
  \ closeness to Ahmed was because of a very integral reason; I search for a little\
  \ me in him every time I meet him. Ahmed never asked me about my religion or age;\
  \ he was never worried that I am a stranger. Ahmed imbibes the spirit of Dargah:\
  \ it does not matter if you are a Hindu, Sikh or Christian; you come, you sit and\
  \ lose yourself in the sea of lights hanging all around trying to illuminate cold\
  \ Delhi evenings. In a flock of strangers, no one really is a stranger.\n\n\u201C\
  Bhaijaan, tea?\u201D he asks as the Qawaali finishes.\n\u201CLet\u2019s go Chotejaan.\
  \ Get me a Parle G too.\u201D"
