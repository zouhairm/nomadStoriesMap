Text: "A track lay before me in a gentle swell of elevation that peaked and troughed\
  \ amidst a sea of ferns rooted in glacial drift.  Trepidation struck, though the\
  \ urge was too strong to ignore, as raw emotion pushed me to spend an evening alone\
  \ on top of a mountain engulfed by pristine rainforest, as the Gregorian calendar\
  \ journeyed into a new era in Aotearoa. \n\nThe trail swiftly increased in gradient\
  \ as I figured I could possibly reach the summit in time for sunset. With this thought,\
  \ I hastened my pace with increased vigour, although not for long, as I was startled\
  \ by an awe-inspiring sight amongst a thicket of trees where the fabled glacier\
  \ K\u0101 Roimata o Hine Hukatere serendipitously appeared across the expansive\
  \ valley. \n\nM\u0101ori mythology tells a story of Hine Hukatere (the avalanche\
  \ girl) mourning the loss of her childhood sweetheart\u2019s misadventure, which\
  \ explained her forlorn expression amongst the cold crumbling greywacke rock earnestly\
  \ exposing her once genial complexion. Time stood still for my first encounter with\
  \ the ice maiden, where her upper lip was glossed by clouds with a crystallised\
  \ tongue. I promised her a second return from a higher point. \nDoubtful, her icy\
  \ tears continued flowing into the fast-running milky river below. \n\nWith heavy\
  \ panting the summit neared. Exposed alpine grass eerily settled in the heavenly\
  \ stillness, where a panoramic sweep of iconic natural landscape before me was hard\
  \ to fathom. A graceful melt of burnt sienna occurred as the sun stealthily slid\
  \ behind a mountain and started to smoulder into the ocean. Sauntered glints of\
  \ the last solar rays tingled and faded amid mountain peaks heavily dusted in snow.\
  \ Reacquainted with the avalanche girl, I anticipated a magical serenade with the\
  \ final setting of the year. Alas, she shyly retreated deep into the valley below\
  \ as the dimpsy came upon, preparing her slumber and reminiscing past escapades\
  \ with her beloved Wawe. \n\nMythed, I descended as time pressed towards the ominous\
  \ twelfth hour. Nearing the bottom, I took rest on a moss laden log beside an upturned\
  \ trunk of a once proud podocarp tree. There displayed was an array of glow worms\
  \ glistening in its roots, enchantingly humming bioluminescence. Above these globule\
  \ starlets were the true constellations dispersed on a pure matt canvas giving an\
  \ uncanny natural symmetry of resonance, incomparable by machine. I pensively advanced\
  \ towards my pervasive reality, albeit glinting with a closeness of the aesthetic\
  \ serenity nature yields."
