Text: "We followed him, red earth beneath us, rising clouds; a cardinal mist of sand\
  \ kicked up by our feet.\n\nIt had been three arduous days, driving down the west\
  \ coast of Australia. Barren landscapes, unsealed roads, the remnants of a once\
  \ pristine RV now coated in a thick layer of memories. At least that\u2019s how\
  \ I like to think of it. Encountering lightning storms in the Geraldton desert,\
  \ our only form of shelter being a large, metal vehicle. Now encrusted with the\
  \ remains of a chronic plague of bush flies at the Pinnacles, hindering any chance\
  \ of us getting our deposit back on the RV. \nBut we were here, miraculously we\
  \ made it. Albeit smelly, tired and extremely sunburnt in the traditional British\
  \ style. We made it to Monkey Mia our last stop, where we met Tau, our Aboriginal\
  \ guide who enveloped us in the mysticism of this hostile yet breath-taking terrain.\
  \ \nIt was six o\u2019clock and the sun had set abruptly over the horizon as we\
  \ began the tour. \n\u2018Pick up the earth in your hands and greet it\u2019, he\
  \ said, an accent soothing in its unfamiliarity. I did what he said out of respect\
  \ for a foreign tradition. Hands on the soil, introducing myself to this alien territory,\
  \ an act that would stir up a few dodgy looks back in the North of England. But\
  \ here I feel I have unearthed a profound understanding of this ancestral connection\
  \ to the land. \nTau set up a fire a few feet from the dunes. Naively expecting\
  \ him to be rubbing sticks together, I looked over in amusement as he pulled out\
  \ a Zippo from his back pocket and lit the pile of wood. However, it succeeded in\
  \ making part of me feel at home on the other side of the world, this modern object\
  \ igniting an ancient practice.\nI watched him stoke the fire, placing fresh fish\
  \ he had caught that day over it while others in the group talked between themselves.\
  \ Tau lit the sandalwood incense beside him and began to play his didgeridoo.\n\
  For that moment I was still. For that moment everyone was still. \nWe were transported\
  \ back. The meditative vibrations playing tribute to a simpler time. The flames\
  \ married the incense rising in the air. I followed it, my eyes watering from the\
  \ smoke. In my tears stars twinkled; big ones, small ones, red ones, all clustered.\
  \ Their emu constellation, a Coalsack nebula, splayed over this Australian sky.\
  \ At that exact point in time, everything seemed so much bigger than me. This small\
  \ sunburnt girl from the north of England had been part of this great adventure.\
  \ Australian dust forever on my hands."
