Text: "A pleasant surprise came to me one spring season. I had won an art contest\
  \ promoting bear safety. My poster had won, they said, because I had drawn the bear\
  \ at a distance. They wanted to emphasize that bear safety is about preventing an\
  \ encounter, not defense against an attack. The prize was a bear viewing tour in\
  \ Katmai National Park; three hundred miles southwest from where I lived in Anchorage,\
  \ Alaska. So, it was that I found myself squeezing into a small sea plane alongside\
  \ my father and the crew. \n We flew out of Homer, the little fishing town on the\
  \ southernmost tip of the Kenai Peninsula.  Within a blink of an eye, civilization\
  \ was lost from view, and there was nothing below us but the grey waters of the\
  \ Cook Inlet. Before us loomed the great Alaska Range, blanketed in snow. \n The\
  \ day was beautiful and clear, but as we descended to land on the beach, a thick\
  \ fog masqueraded the bright blue sky.  The plane bounced and rattled, spewing up\
  \ the sand behind it until coming to a stop.  The air was cold and wet under the\
  \ fog, and smelled of spruce trees and sea-salt.  The tide was low, and we began\
  \ walking down the beach.\n \u201CWhere\u2019s your gun?\u201D My dad asked.\n \u201C\
  Don\u2019t have one.\u201D The guide said.  \u201COnly flares and mace.\u201D\n\
  \ My dad\u2019s eyebrows knitted together in concern. He had never liked bears.\
  \  \n \u201CWalk close together so we appear bigger.\u201D  The guide instructed,\
  \ pointing to a lumbering mass visible through the fog no more than a hundred feet\
  \ away.\n  My dad gripped my shoulders as we approached the huge brown bear that\
  \ lay in the sand. He was as big as an SUV. My senses heightened from adrenaline,\
  \ I could see every individual strand of brown fur.  I could see the sharp nails\
  \ on his paws that were bigger than my head.\n I remembered my art contest. Weren\u2019\
  t we not supposed to be close enough to see such detail? Yet, here I was, purposely\
  \ imposing on their territory. \n  I wanted to stop and turn back. I told myself\
  \ this was crazy; I was certain that I was walking towards a mauling.  \n We weren\u2019\
  t but thirty feet from the bear.  \n \u201CHey, bear.\u201D The guide said. The\
  \ bear opened his amber eyes, and regarded us with a kindness I hadn\u2019t expected.\n\
  \ \u201CDid you know that in some cultures, bears are the most peaceful creatures?\u201D\
  \ the guide asked. \n I hadn\u2019t known, and wondered why that mythology had been\
  \ forgotten. I thought of how fear distorts reality; if I had allowed it to overcome\
  \ me, I wouldn\u2019t be having this experience. What then were my other fears in\
  \ comparison to a bear?"
