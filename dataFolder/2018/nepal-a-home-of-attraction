Text: "\"oh! wow, look at that beautifully Pashupatinath temple surrounded with the\
  \ attractive high mountains, feels me that I am roaming in the temples of India\"\
  -- a quick response when i first capture that moment from my bus. As soon i step\
  \ out from the bus, couldn't stop myself and run to the exit of bus station, but\
  \ suddenly i fall down then my father picked me up --- said, you are in mountain\
  \ region and thus path are not straight and plane, so be care yourself. The narrow\
  \ and zig-zag road made on the high altitude greenish mountains resembles like it\
  \ wear some jewelry made by nature, added more happiness. The beautifully designed\
  \ houses on the up and down of the hill; the melodious sounds coming from stream;\
  \ the aroma coming from the flowers; that golden moment when ray of sun on that\
  \ snowy mountains which hinder themselves behind the greenish mountain, connect\
  \ my heart with this place.\nAfter coming out from the temples, we put our-self\
  \ to stop at the food stall, order for food and started looking at the beauty of\
  \ the place. One cute boy carry number of cups filled up of Tea, in his sweet Nepali\
  \ language - sir, you want a cup of Tea and Biscuit with his smiling face, i couldn't\
  \ stop myself from taking a cup of tea and he go for serving other tea & snacks.\
  \ His smile with sweet Nepali language added in the beauty of the place and feels\
  \ me with joy. Now i took my camera and we started moving ahead and in short while\
  \ we reached at the place to climb high and watch the view of city. As the sun ahead\
  \ towards its set-down, the beauty of city started set-up. \n\"OMG-OMG!! I couldn't\
  \ believe, can't stop myself right now to go there, please-please, uff how could\
  \ control myself\",- a reaction came when i was standing at some height on the mountain\
  \ and watching the spectacular view of the city at night, just want to furl this\
  \ moment in my heart. That particular moment from morning to night connects me like\
  \ I am at my place at India i.e., as local connection, but then that passport, divides\
  \ my dream that I am outside of my country.\nAt last, paid $10 to taxi driver and\
  \ drag out my luggage and with partial happiness, check-in and close the windows\
  \ and fly high over the mountains. with waiting for fresh morning at my land i.e.,\
  \ at Delhi."
