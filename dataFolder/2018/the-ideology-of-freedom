Text: "When I came to Israel in November 2017 I hadn\u2019t expected that the conflict\
  \ between Israel and Palestine would affect my life and turn my whole world around\
  \ in way I had never experienced before.\nI came into this country as an artist,\
  \ that adventurous independent travel girl, that was always willing to take the\
  \ more challenging path. I was traveling with a street-performance I called \u201E\
  Touching I\u201C. What is the essence of touching? These question brought me to\
  \ pack my rucksack and travel to one of the most sensitive places on earth. But\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find what I found in the end. \nInvestigating Jerusalem\
  \ was like swimming in a pool of diversity. Where Christianity, Judaism and Islam\
  \ were spiced with tensions and misunderstanding. From this city which is meant\
  \ to be, according to the old testament, the origin of humankind many different\
  \ stories where formed over decades of different rulerships. Jerusalems was always\
  \ in constant transformation until today when US Pr. D. Trump recently declared\
  \ it as the capital of Israel.\nBy the time of T. declaration I had made my way\
  \ to Bethlehem which is under control of Palestinian authority. Crossing the checkpoint\
  \ means to enter a new reality. There I met a guy named David.\nI came to the country\
  \ to learn something about touching and got deeply touched by the story of a man,\
  \ who grew up in a traditional jewish family in America. He was born in Israel and\
  \ decided to come back in 2010 to travel the palestinian areas. Thanks to his american\
  \ passport he was able to cross the checkpoint which for Israelis is an offense\
  \ by law. He was not willing to follow any of those ideologies and settled down\
  \ in Betlehem. Not to be against the system but to be a silent statement that points\
  \ its finger on nonsense stories that causes human beings so much pain and sorrow.\
  \ \nInevitable for me not to fall in love with such an sensitive human being that\
  \ sees the world as unity, as existent in a common universe. A man who treats his\
  \ historical archenemy with respect and welfare.\nWhat began like a fairytale on\
  \ the roof of his old restored house in Bethlehem, in a night gemmed with stars,\
  \ sitting in a porch swing, talking about life and eventually ending up in tender\
  \ kisses had turned into a lection that is teaching me now the master discipline\
  \ of letting go what you love the most. \nI remained deeply touched by the stories\
  \ of this complex part of the world and of course by my personal experiences that\
  \ will linger for a long time."
