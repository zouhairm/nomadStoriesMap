Text: "You know being in the summertime is always the boring choice. You stay in your\
  \ house, play videogames Buuut not in my case. I was born to travel. It was just\
  \ a morning like this and I got a call from my friend. \"MANALI CHALNA HAI\"(LETS\
  \ GO TO MANALI). I mean if it was in my hands, I would have straight away said us\
  \ but first of all, I needed to ask my parents and BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THEY SAID\
  \ YES. I got to work to pack up and we were leaving the next day (I got the message\
  \ from my friend late...... IDIOT). After the 8 hour journey, I was amazed to see\
  \ the natural beauty hidden in the hills away from the hustle and bustle of the\
  \ city. But you never expect what happens when you are in a group of 20 people and\
  \ the smallest of all. \n\nIt all started when we decided to go on Kheerganga Trekking\
  \ which is a 5-hour walking distance to the top of the hill. Being the shortest\
  \ I was also the fastest. But in all this, I lost my group. In my defence, I was\
  \ told that you couldn't get a room after 7 and it was already when I reached the\
  \ top. I thought that I was just being obnoxious and they would be coming just now\
  \ but for an hour straight no one came. I took out my phone and started showing\
  \ some other travellers to recognise them but no one seemed to know where they were.\
  \ There was not a single bar of signal that I could contact them. I had already\
  \ booked a tent for me and the others so I just went back sat with the tent owners\
  \ and had a cup of tea to relax. The owner's name was Taechung Kumar But he said\
  \ that you could call me Kumar. I thought that maybe my friends were here till now\
  \ so I took my chances and went once again to the other end to search for them.\
  \ Kumar also accompanied me and also his dog (Reiki). We started to look from the\
  \ top of the hill and the last and finally, we found them. They were also looking\
  \ for me so yeah I was happy to see them once again.\n\nThey had already found a\
  \ room a room they wanted to stay in but I decided as Kumar had helped us a lot,\
  \ we should stay in his hotel stay only as a form of repayment. The next day we\
  \ had to reach Manali but the rush wasn't helping at all. I knew that Kumar had\
  \ some contacts in Manali. So I asked him if he could get us a room and said \"\
  DEKHTE HAIN\" and after some time he called again that he got us a room nearby.\
  \ So I thanked him and that was how I got an unexpected friend who helped me the\
  \ whole time on my trip and I try to keep in touch with him even today whenever\
  \ possible."
