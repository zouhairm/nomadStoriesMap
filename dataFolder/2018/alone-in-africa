Text: "Alone, I set off for Livingstonia, an historical missionary town on a mountaintop.\
  \ I decided to go backstreet, having read that a direct route involves lethal hairpins.\
  \ Not long after turning, \u2018Betty\u2019 the Landcruiser lost control and I found\
  \ myself facing a ditch. Children surrounded the car, fascinated by a trapped Mzungu\
  \ (white person). Then: \u201CStop! She is our sister!\u201D Locals congregated\
  \ to offer advice in broken English. Eventually, in desperation, I let an enthusiastic\
  \ villager drive Betty out of the bog. Everyone assured me the road ahead was safe\
  \ so I kept on. Not long, I was stuck again. Villagers gathered, this time sinister,\
  \ one man like Cyclops but strangely dwarf-like. In retrospect, I should have turned\
  \ back, but crossing two catastrophes had pushed me out the other side to a feeling\
  \ of no return, so on I went, this time with a new driver: swathe, overconfident\
  \ and wearing a tightly fastened suit jacket. An \"assistant\" jumped in on my other\
  \ side; a sensitive character. Stuck between a rock and a hard place, I suggested,\
  \ pinned between two African men, that they drive me all the way to Livingstonia.\
  \ I've later found out that the mountain had experienced four weeks of solid rain\
  \ with little to no sunshine. Daylight fading and we were stuck once more. Villagers\
  \ again, this time at night in the form of a mad, wrangling, desperate crowd. One\
  \ man screaming at me ludicrously, \u201CLook, madam! Look what I am doing!\u201D\
  \ as he shoved branches under Betty's wheels. I begged everyone to stop but they\
  \ pushed on, heaving at Betty, who was signalling exhaustion or complete refusal\
  \ to cooperate; she wouldn't start. It was over. I would spend this night in the\
  \ car. I did not sleep well and certainly not when the rain came, thick, full, angry,\
  \ early the next day. We started the engine and Betty reluctantly coughed back to\
  \ life. We never could have imagined the road to be worse, but it was an increasingly\
  \ deep river of thick, turbulent mud. God only knows, after a white knuckle ride,\
  \ we found ourselves at the top, rumbling through a quiet, unsuspecting Livingstonia.\
  \ Parting ways with my unlikely chauffeurs, I found a sleepy lodge overlooking the\
  \ valley, down across to the liquid marvel of Lake Malawi, the Mozambique border\
  \ brimming on the horizon. I fell asleep with a chorus of gospel voices echoing\
  \ across the mountain. Favourite shop names noted in town: \u201CBlessings Executive\
  \ Barber Shop & Phone Charging\u201D, \u201CGod is With You\u201D - general store,\
  \ \u201CYes I Can Corner Shop\u201D."
