Text: "You expect certain things when you climb Mount Kilimanjaro.  You expect to\
  \ summit, and that reaching the summit will be difficult.  You expect it to be cold,\
  \ such that you will wear each and every layer of clothes that you packed.  And\
  \ you expect it to be amazing, a once in a lifetime experience, as you take in that\
  \ view from the very top of Africa and realize just how incredible is your achievement.\n\
  When I summited Mount Kilimanjaro earlier this month, each of these expectations\
  \ was met and then some.  It was challenging, to be sure, but beautiful and rewarding,\
  \ and something that I will remember for the rest of my days.\nWhat I did not expect\
  \ was to befriend a new travel companion.  When I signed up for the trek, I was\
  \ a party of one.  It was, quite literally, to be a solo mission up the mountain\
  \ \u2013 just me and the guides and porters.  Then, about a month before leaving\
  \ for Tanzania, I learned that one other person also had signed up for the trek.\n\
  Questions raced through my head.  Was the other person a he or a she?  If a he,\
  \ would he be a European Adonis?  Or, as my one of my girlfriends speculated, a\
  \ wizened Nepalese man who would regale me with stories of climbing Mount Everest?\
  \  Would he or she be nice?  And fun?  Would we get cranky after days spent in close\
  \ quarters without the ability to take a shower?  What if he or she did not like\
  \ me?  \nAs it turns out, I needn\u2019t have worried.  My trekking partner was\
  \ an American of the male persuasion, of about my age, and a seasoned traveler.\
  \  Both of us were (and still are) on sabbaticals, having quit our jobs for a time\
  \ to travel, and during the trek, we realized that we travel well together.  We\
  \ easily fell into conversation and never ran short of topics of discussion.  We\
  \ also quickly overcame the slight awkwardness of having to share lodging \u2013\
  \ no one gets complete privacy on the way up the mountain \u2013 and we each came\
  \ to appreciate the other\u2019s preferences and habits.  \nAs of this writing,\
  \ my new friend (yes, just a friend) and I are planning to spend a few weeks traveling\
  \ in Italy.  It can be hard to find a good travel buddy, as even the best of friends\
  \ sometimes make poor travel companions.  But if our experience to date is any indication,\
  \ we will have a wonderful time in Italy and there will be more travel adventures\
  \ to come.  And when I think back, I am glad that I was brave enough to possibly\
  \ go it alone, for I otherwise may have missed the opportunity to meet someone new\
  \ and share my travel experiences."
