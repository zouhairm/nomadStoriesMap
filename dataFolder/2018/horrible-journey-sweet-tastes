Text: "\u201CHow you decided yourself?\u201D It\u2019s Exams time, Sports is merely\
  \ a free time activity. No, I will not allow. Never, Ever! \nNobody can stop me.\
  \ It\u2019s my Life, my decisions! I replied. \nSpendthrift! Have no money, \u201C\
  Pinching pennies\u201D for your studies. Her emotions and care forced me to rethink!\
  \  \n\u201CYou are not the victim of the world, but rather the master of your own\
  \ destiny.\u201D \n\u201CGo for it now. The future is promised to no one.\u201D\
  \ A sound interrupted my thoughts; \u201Cbig brother\u201D supported my decision.\
  \ \nTry to understand, that\u2019s not a safe place to visit, affected by long violent\
  \ and militant ethnic conflict.\nNo, No\u2026., \u201CDon\u2019t try to frighten\
  \ me, Mom?\u201D My decision is final.\nO.K, Your choice! Ultimately \u201Cit\u2019\
  s your choices and decisions that determine your destiny.\u201D But always remember,\
  \ never make a decision when you are Angry, Hungry and lonely. Mom replied.\n\u201C\
  Don\u2019t go outside, stay here and never make an eye contact with the locals.\u201D\
  \ Coach directed us while waiting for bus to Imphal inside travel agency. \nAs we\
  \ moved out, \u201Csomeone grabbed the neck of my teammate,\u201D the situation\
  \ was saved by another local! \nThe moment we started dinner, a loud and noisy shot\
  \ heard outside made the situation grim. \nThank God! The bus came but only to add\
  \ fears with broken glasses and injured passengers.  \n\u201CSome outsiders were\
  \ forced to flee their places naked by the militants,\u201D travel agent added fuel\
  \ to the fire.\nThen I realized that my decision really pushed me to the edge and\
  \ decided to drop again.\n\u201CYou may not control all the events that happened\
  \ to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them,\u201D said one of my team\
  \ mates, and helps to gain some confidence again. \nIt\u2019s December, Christmas\
  \ time, the decorated huts with buntings and stars, full blooming moon \u201CAt\
  \ Dead of night\u201D made me tranquil as we started our journey through hillock.\
  \ All of a sudden, a gunman in black, behind the Pine hurled a brick towards the\
  \ driver, shocked everyone! By God\u2019s grace we managed to escape.\nWe reached\
  \ late, Competition was already begun but with high confidence I played to clinch\
  \ bronze. And finally I realized that my decision really pushed me to the edge but\
  \ gives sweet tastes."
