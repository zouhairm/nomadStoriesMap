Text: "Two police plunked cushioned office chairs down next to us, gesturing emphatically\
  \ for us to sit.\n\nVillagers had advised my husband and me to station ourselves\
  \ across the street from a security checkpoint. Now the officials were concerned.\n\
  \nThe issue was not our hitchhiking intentions, nor our hard-earned permits to travel\
  \ independently in a restricted zone. Apparently, the worn wooden bench we\u2019\
  d adopted was not sufficiently comfortable to wait upon. In Bhutan, hospitality\
  \ is paramount, but this seemed comically excessive.\n\nA handful of cars passed\
  \ by before a patrol car pulled up. The officers, with whom we had been sharing\
  \ local mandarin oranges, suddenly stood at attention. To our surprise, a familiar\
  \ face emerged from the jeep: Lieutenant Kuenzang Dema, who we'd recently met through\
  \ a friend of a friend. As an intrepid woman who's realized her childhood dream\
  \ of joining the police force, her story is indicative of the rapid social change\
  \ gripping Bhutan as it modernizes.\n\nKuenzang ordered her subordinates to secure\
  \ us a ride. The police were now doing our legwork, interviewing each driver for\
  \ a suitable match. We basked in the absurdity of our VIP hitchhiking status. Where\
  \ else, but this pervasively Buddhist kingdom, would law enforcement go to great\
  \ lengths to ensure the utmost comfort of random travelers?\n\n\"So, do you remember\
  \ me?\" posed the forester driving a tiny hatchback bumping its way toward our common\
  \ goal of Trongsa.\n\nMatt and I admitted, regrettably, we didn't. It turns out\
  \ we had once played volleyball together at the far end of this Himalayan nation.\
  \ With a population of 800,000, Bhutanese can uncover a connection to nearly everyone,\
  \ but as foreigners we never expected to be part of such serendipitous overlap.\n\
  \nThe inherent interconnectedness is surely influential in the generous conduct\
  \ of Bhutanese; cultural norms place the community before the individual. However,\
  \ it goes both ways. Communal benevolence also reinforces the value of the individual\
  \ to the community, thereby strengthening both.\n\nUpon reaching our humble hotel,\
  \ we offered gas money in the customary manner of insisting at least three times\
  \ lest the receiver appear greedy. The forester still refused, so we \u201Caccidentally\u201D\
  \ left a sack of oranges in the back seat instead.\n\nBhutan showed us that anyone\
  \ can create opportunities to reach out to someone--familiar or foreign--with kindness,\
  \ even if the gesture seems as out of place as an office chair on the side of a\
  \ dusty back road."
