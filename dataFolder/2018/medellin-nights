Text: "The room is cramped, the ceiling is low and a steamy fog drifts through the\
  \ dance floor. Her dark hands are laced around his neck and their bodies shadow\
  \ one another in a salsa rhapsody. \n\nShe is tall and wears a red dress. He is\
  \ unremarkable but it doesn\u2019t matter. All that counts in Colombian salsa is\
  \ the poetry your bodies make with the music and the two of them moved together\
  \ like a red paintbrush across the night sky.\n\nI stir the melting ice cubes in\
  \ my pina colada. It\u2019s hard to imagine Medellin as the former \"murder capital\"\
  \ of the world when my biggest worry now is being on the wrong side of a passionate\
  \ dip. \n\nLuis had invited me to see his home city when we met four years ago on\
  \ my first trip to South America. Medellin\u2019s reputation made me nervous and\
  \ I\u2019d politely declined. \n\nBut here I was a few years later with a stranger\
  \ I\u2019d once crossed paths with in an Ecuadorian museum, and in a salsa bar that\
  \ drug lord Pablo Escobar could\u2019ve once ransacked. I wondered if I\u2019d become\
  \ more brave or simply sought out more fear. \n\nOne night, I\u2019d asked Luis\
  \ about growing up in Escobar\u2019s era. He remembered it well: the sound of shooting,\
  \ the smell of blood, the penetrating fear that struck everyone. \n\nI was quiet.\
  \ Thirty years later, we sat eating warm cheese empanadas in a park where people\
  \ had killed.\n\n\u201CAnd now they walk among us,\" Luis had told me, nodding at\
  \ an old man sitting on the street opposite us, alone. \n\nI\u2019d asked about\
  \ it so casually, as if his life were a chapter from a mystery novel. Then here\
  \ was this old man, broken by history, and here was Luis, a living artefact of Medellin\u2019\
  s transformation and the reason why people like me could come here today, ask about\
  \ Escobar and dance salsa.\n\n\u201CEverybody knows salsa,\u201D an unfamiliar voice\
  \ tells me as I watch the woman in red. \n\nHis name is Matias and he\u2019s from\
  \ Venezuela. I know enough of Venezuela\u2019s political situation to know he\u2019\
  s not here on a holiday like me but his whole face is smiling, from the crinkles\
  \ around his eyes to the dimples in his cheeks. \n\n\u201CWe start from when we\u2019\
  re babies, and it\u2019s a necessity of life,\u201D he says cheekily, asking me\
  \ if I want to learn.\n\nSo we float into the sea of couples, hand in hand, laughing,\
  \ and not realising what was about to happen. \n\nHere was I, a tourist passing\
  \ through and ready to leave tomorrow. Here was Matias, working out his next move\
  \ in a nightmare. And here we were together, two strangers creating poetry in Medellin\u2019\
  s history that nobody would ever read about."
