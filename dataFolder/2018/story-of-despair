Text: "Sunday, April 10, 2016 in the third hour of the first half of the day on a\
  \ spring fresh wind dazzles my view, directed to the distance, where the horizon\
  \ is visible, and waves wash the edges of my vessel.\nMy name is Thomas Gill, I'm\
  \ 30 and I'm floating on my new  yacht in the Gulf of Mexico. \nIn fact, I'm unemployed.\
  \ You probably ask where the unemployed yacht comes from 300,000 euros. So I have\
  \ a very rich wife, or rather her family. My wife, she is Mrs. Margaret Gill, the\
  \ most delicate creature and the kindest person in the world, with the most beautiful\
  \ laughter. \nWe met in September 2006 in the sands of the Arabian desert, then\
  \ I was a student at a medical university in Michigan, hungry for knowledge and\
  \ incredible adventures, it was love at first sight. I knew she understood me like\
  \ no other.\nTogether we visited many different places on the planet, for example:\
  \ the raging waves of the Pacific Ocean or the vast sands of the Sahara. But life\
  \ changes.\nThree years after the meeting, I made her marriage offer, in the same\
  \ place in Egypt. To the  Zaffe's wedding march, we gave each other a  marriage\
  \ vow. Later we moved to Louisiana. \nAfter the wedding, I insisted on going to\
  \ Peru. Margaret was pregnant, during our trip to where she had a miscarriage for\
  \ the first and last time and did not leave the place with the house named, it was\
  \ unbearable.\nOnce we laughed and swore, and now, we do not talk at all, only silence.\
  \ Previously filled with laughter, talk, and plans for future travel, the place\
  \ became a place of return, where it was like torture, and photos from travel only\
  \ aggravated the situation. She left me.\nSo after my dismissal from the general\
  \ practice, I jerked at the gift given by Margaret's parents to our wedding, a yacht\
  \ to the shores of the Gulf of Mexico, to think. But the unexpectedly started storm\
  \ did not make me wait long, and now I'm plowing the waves, somewhere near the Cuban\
  \ islands.\nI like freedom. But when I close my eyes, I see her smile, I hear her\
  \ laugh. Most of all I like to think about our travels. The most memorable  how\
  \ we visited the oldest museum in Europe in Vienna, and the festival of fireworks\
  \ in Kyoto,and the first time we tried the croissants in one of the small cafes\
  \ in Paris and this unforgettable night of Buenos Aires. We never saw the stars\
  \ brighter, and the sound of guitars playing tango still sound in my ears.\n\"I\
  \ miss her,\" and at that time decided to return home. There it all began and ended,\
  \ to where she is no more."
