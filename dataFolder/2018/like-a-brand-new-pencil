Text: "Rwanda is the land of 1000 hills and 1000 smiles. There is not a flat surface\
  \ to be found here. Steep, tiered farm plots patchwork the mountains, living quilts\
  \ tended by hands, bent backs, and garden tools. A line of women in colorful dresses\
  \ work a field, hoes rising and falling in a gentle cadence. Wide-smiled children,\
  \ beg for pencils and empty water bottles.\n\nWe drive to the Virunga Mountains,\
  \ a range shared by troubled countries: Rwanda, Uganda, and the DR Congo. They are\
  \ home to the last 880 mountain gorillas, nearly extinct due to poaching, conflict,\
  \ and encroachment. The farms reach right to the edge of the Volcanos National Park.\n\
  \nI am passionate about being here to see the gorillas in their habitat. To just\
  \ watch them be. To feel some connection with our closest cousin. Every article\
  \ I read highlights more atrocities, more losses, and I am afraid time will run\
  \ out. \n\nThe following day is trek day. We rise predawn for the park's opening\
  \ ceremony. Traditional dancers sing songs to guide us to the gorillas. We sip hot\
  \ tea and slip tips in their jar while our permits are hand-processed. \n\nWe meet\
  \ our guide, porters, and guards - a professional group. It's a three-hour trek\
  \ to last night's nest site. Early trackers will radio us coordinates. It is well\
  \ organized. They want everyone to find the gorillas; their survival depends on\
  \ it.\n\nWe bushwhack through dense, giant vegetation - ferns, bamboo, stinging\
  \ nettles - and rain. Mud sucks our boots. Fire ants provoke yelps, slaps, and stripping.\
  \ It's funny when it isn't you. \n\nWe stop. Listen. Move forward. The radio crackles.\
  \ We listen harder. \n\nThe gorillas are ahead of us. We increase our pace, nearly\
  \ a run. The guide stops. Puts his hand up. Points.\n\n\"There.\"\n\nHe makes gorilla\
  \ grunts. We step into the group, moving with them. We catch their musk, mixed with\
  \ sweet dung, earth, and leaves.\n \nTiny, wide-eyed, wild-haired babies cling to\
  \ their mothers. Juveniles scramble up vines, swing, tumble, wrestle, fall from\
  \ trees. They beat their chests and grunt. A baby wobbles on new legs. A young female\
  \ charges, slapping my camera. They lounge about, peeling and eating their bamboo.\n\
  \nThe 400-pound silverback sat leaning against a tree, his huge back to me. I crept\
  \ around to catch his face. He turned. I froze. He held my eyes for a long moment.\
  \ He seemed, thoughtful. Then he got up and walked away to eat his bamboo in peace.\
  \ \n\nWet, muddy, and standing in gorilla poo, I smiled like a Rwandan child, who'd\
  \ just got a brand-new pencil."
