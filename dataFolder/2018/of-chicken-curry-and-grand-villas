Text: "\u201CAre you sure, we can squeeze this one in?\u201D my buddy quizzed, as\
  \ we slurped away liquid sambhar off a green banana leaf just outside the gates\
  \ of the Meenakshi Temple in Madurai. My buddy and I were on an impromptu back-packing\
  \ trip; our own little Temple Run! And the place in question was Chettinad, a group\
  \ of small villages set up by the trading community of Nattukottai Chettiars famous\
  \ for the grandiose of the architecture of their villas built in the early 1900s\
  \ (yes, they have their special chicken curry, too!). Chettinad was out of the way,\
  \ out of the agenda and out of the budget; hence out of the question! But\u2026\n\
  \nThe next morning, a rickety state-run bus dropped us at a dusty village crossroad\
  \ and a yellow signboard led us into a village, not to find a soul in sight. The\
  \ splendid imagination of an artsy district that is Chettinad was slowly meeting\
  \ with a thud, but the last thing expected was a deserted village\u2026\nA young\
  \ boy on a bicycle informed us that we are in the Ramachandrapuram village and pointed\
  \ us to a narrow lane ahead. On both sides of the forsaken lane ran plastered brick\
  \ walls fencing the villas. We stopped and rattled the Iron Gates of one of the\
  \ houses. A frail old man popped his head out and scoffed at us in coarse Tamil.\
  \ After our many earnest requests and passing him a hundred rupee note, Rajan, the\
  \ caretaker threw opened the gates informing us that nobody actually lived in these\
  \ villas anymore; the masters had settled on foreign shores decades ago. \nThe Chettiars\
  \ had travelled all over the world on account of their many businesses which inspired\
  \ them to replicate the foreign building styles and luxuries in their family homes.\
  \ They brought in building materials from distant lands and fused them with vernacular\
  \ techniques and symbols creating their own blend of architecture - the pitch and\
  \ gable roof covered in terracotta tiles supported by Burma teak columns, the courtyard\
  \ houses approached through high arched openings, Italian tiles, Belgian glasses,\
  \ ornated rosewood carvings finding their match with imagery of Gajalaxmi on the\
  \ doors or a stucco fa\xE7ade of Shiv-Parvati; quintessentially a Hindu home done\
  \ in borrowed foreign taste.\n\nMy buddy and I often reminisce; had that day lived\
  \ up to our dramatic imaginations about Chettinad, we would have only been partaking\
  \ in a curated museum like tour of the place and not in the fulfilling experience\
  \ of self-discovery and adventure that unfolded; but, of course, no Chettinad Chicken\
  \ curry for us!"
