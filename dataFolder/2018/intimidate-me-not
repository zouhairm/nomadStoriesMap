Text: "The MP3 plugged into my car speakers and I start it A-Z so there are no repeats.\
  \ My feet, in the most comfortable slip on shoes I own, ease off the clutch to feel\
  \ the gas engage. I have not owned a manual long and at this point I drive by feel\
  \ and sound. It feels as though she judges me any time I stall. I am itching to\
  \ stretch her legs on the highway. I can tell when to shift to second, to third,\
  \ to fourth, which I hold until I see the city limit sign, and then I let the car\
  \ stretch into fifth gear. Except, I nearly piss myself and turn around within the\
  \ first 30 minutes due to being trapped in a whiteout behind a gas tanker and a\
  \ big rig right behind me. I had to pull off to the side and slow right down to\
  \ let them both get ahead of me. I was not taking risks in my tiny sports car, studded\
  \ tires or not. I made sure to relax my white knuckles every so often. I promised\
  \ my mom I would go slow. Luckily, after an hour, the weather cleared and the roads\
  \ were dry. \nNot every trip is a languorous, meandering journey. No, they are grueling\
  \ 8-10 hour hauls, if you go twenty over the speed limit every chance you get on\
  \ good, clear roads with quick fuel ups and quicker bathroom breaks. Daylight hours\
  \ cut short which does not bode well for covering a lot of territory. I never stop\
  \ doing scans of the ditches for movement, dark spots or the eye shine. I do not\
  \ like driving at night because being blinded by headlights is a form of sensory\
  \ torture. There is nothing to really focus on while my eyes adjust. I hope I do\
  \ not crash. The friend I am visiting in Edmonton for the weekend can drive Highway\
  \ 16 back and forth to Prince George, any time, in any season, with her little bug.\
  \ I could too. I pumped myself up with spoken words of encouragement, interspersed\
  \ by neurotic laughter and I admit I felt crazy in that moment. \nThe decision that\
  \ pushed me to the edge was when I decided not to let the highway intimidate me.\
  \ I fortified, pushed pass all my fear and undertook the road through the Rockies,\
  \ all by myself. It does make me feel good, strong, the way it should. I am in control\
  \ behind the wheel by feeling how the car wants to drift on the asphalt. I realize\
  \ that the smallest, imperceptible correction on the steering wheel at those speeds\
  \ ripple out in bigger movements. I am forced to be calm, not react suddenly or\
  \ be in a hurry. It is about fine touches, steady breaths and foot control. I travel\
  \ with purpose because I am more than capable of handling the road ahead."
