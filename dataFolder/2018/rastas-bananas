Text: "As I sat at the boarding gates awaiting departure, thinking to myself, \u201C\
  what in Michaels name have I got myself into?\u201D It would have been a lot cheaper\
  \ and more comfortable travelling to an exotic island somewhere in the Caribbean,\
  \ sipping pina coladas whilst precariously balancing in a hammock. But alas, I am\
  \ Sudan bound, to spend 2 months on a saddle (or the floor) with no formal ablution\
  \ facilities. It does make for a far more interesting tale tho. \nMy arrival into\
  \ Sudan was rather uneventful as the plane touched down in a plume of dust. It is\
  \ indeed a dry country with a silver sliver of the Nile cutting through the land.\
  \ The locals are extremely friendly and welcoming and although my time in Sudan\
  \ was short it was very enjoyable enjoyable. We cycled down through the country\
  \ to sign out of Sudan, cross the bridge to Matema and sign-in to Ethiopia. There\
  \ is immediately a stark difference as the scenery switched from dry, flat landscape\
  \ to beautiful green rolling hills speckled with cattle, people and villages every\
  \ few kilometers. \nWe cycled down to Shashemene, the capital of Rastafarianism\
  \ in Africa where I took the opportunity to check out the Banana Gallery and chat\
  \ to a few of the residents of the 12 Lions Rasta community.\nThe Banana Gallery\
  \ is a simple, rustic, one room gallery in the artist, Banda Payne\u2019s house.\
  \ He left St Vincent in the Caribbean (apparantly the pina coladas aren't that good)\
  \ in 1994 and has been a local resident ever since, never having returned home.\
  \ As Banda says \u201CAfrica be his home now\u201D. \n\nHe produces all-natural\
  \ art work, creating images using the different colours found in the husk of banana\
  \ trees. We spent several hours on his porch chatting about bananas, life and everything\
  \ in-between along with his loyal corgi named \"Judgement\" and neatly rolled joints\
  \ by his side ready to smoke on the hour.\n\nThe rusta community in Shashemene has\
  \ decreased in size, as a lot of them left when times were tough, but the ones left\
  \ behind are all generally well educated, usually from the uk or the states and\
  \ live a simple existence in Ethiopia. It was indeed an surreal afternoon, most\
  \ of which I hope to remember."
