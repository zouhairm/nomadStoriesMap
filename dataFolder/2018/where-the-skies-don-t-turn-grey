Text: "When I decided I was dropping out of university to travel, I was SAD. I wasn\u2019\
  t sad in capital letters; I had seasonal affective disorder. I had to get away from\
  \ Montreal, which, at the time, seemed to be the problem. Montreal had been ruined\
  \ for me. There were so many places I dreaded to go, scared to run into the ghosts\
  \ of boyfriends past. In fact, Montreal had, in some ways, became the ex I was running\
  \ away from. While Montreal may not have been in actual ruins, it might as well\
  \ have. \n\nThe program I had applied for would get me a job teaching french somewhere\
  \ else in Canada. I wasn\u2019t allowed to pick the place; they would pick it for\
  \ me. I liked the russian roulette twist to it. \n\nThe last thing I expected was\
  \ to be sent in British-Columbia. See, there is a long history of Quebecers moving\
  \ to BC to pick cherries in the Okanagan Valley for a whole summer as part of some\
  \ kind of divine illumination. A modern-day pilgrimage. Only with a different kind\
  \ of worshiping, which only has in common the standing on your knees part. A journey\
  \ where most people don\u2019t end up seeing god, but they definitely end up seeing\
  \ something from all the drugs. I used to make fun of those people with the ex I\
  \ was now running from. And yet, here I was, packing my life into one suitcase with\
  \ a plane ticket for Vancouver. \n\nAs clich\xE9 as it may sound, taking a step\
  \ back from your life as it is can help you see the bigger picture. I wasn\u2019\
  t happy back in Montreal, but not because of my depression or my ex. I wasn\u2019\
  t happy in Montreal because I had been there for so long, I could feel the city\u2019\
  s walls closing in on me. I was feeling like Luke Skywalker in Star Wars. Or as\
  \ if I was part Jigsaw\u2019s games, if you have a more twisted mind. \n\nWhile\
  \ moving to BC is not a permanent step for me, it has been the awakening I needed.\
  \ Perhaps, the infamous enlightenment people come here looking for, without the\
  \ standing on my knees and popping pills part, don\u2019t worry Mom. I don\u2019\
  t want to work a whole year at a 9-to-5 job I hate just to be able to afford a one\
  \ week trip; I want my whole life to be an adventure. I want to buy a van and drive\
  \ from Alaska to Argentina, teach english in Taiwan or sail around the world. I\
  \ don\u2019t want to sit back and wait for things to happen anymore. The most important\
  \ thing I\u2019ve learned on that journey is that while things are never black or\
  \ white, when it comes to living and traveling, there are two types of people :\
  \ settlers and nomads. Those who do and those who don\u2019t."
