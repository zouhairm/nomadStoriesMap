Text: "\"I still can't believe you're here,\" Emily said, equal parts amused and amazed.\
  \ We all laughed. Loopy from sleep deprivation, we were riding off the high of my\
  \ improbable last minute decision. A few hours earlier I was finishing dinner and\
  \ putting my laundry in the dryer. I stopped in my housemate Helena's room. She\
  \ and two my two other housemates were headed to Melbourne airport in 45 minutes\
  \ to catch a flight bound for New Zealand's South Island. They'd been planning the\
  \ trip for months and had asked me to join but work obligations and my rapidly dwindling\
  \ savings had forced me to say no. I watched as Helena folded clothes and put them\
  \ in her bag. \"You know, it's not too late,\" she said. Her Danish accent never\
  \ failed to charm. Matt, another roommate, popped his head into the room and joined\
  \ the persuading. \"C'mon, Mel. There's still one spot left in the van.\" \n\n\"\
  I can't,\" I told them. \"I'm sorry.\"\n\nFast forward an hour and I was en route\
  \ to the airport with my closest (and possibly only) friends in the Southern Hemisphere\
  \ and a bag full of still damp clothes. I was thrilled by my own boldness-- this\
  \ was the most impulsive thing I'd ever done. With less than 30 minutes to spare\
  \ before we needed to leave, I'd thrown caution to the wind and booked a last minute\
  \ flight.\n\n\"I can't believe I'm here either,\" I laughed. The four of us, each\
  \ from a different country, were crammed into a van which was currently winding\
  \ its way down a road flanked by water the exact shade of blue cotton candy. We'd\
  \ all left our own set of pressing concerns behind us in Melbourne. A recent break\
  \ up, the never-ending struggle to pay the bills, an impending medical procedure\
  \ and a nagging, ceaseless anxiety about the future all trailed behind our shabby,\
  \ beat-up van like invisible party streamers. It felt like if we drove fast enough,\
  \ they'd stay behind us, dancing frantically in the wind.\n\nBy the time we reached\
  \ Lake Wanaka it was dusk. The campsite was deserted except for some ducks paddling\
  \ in the ice blue lake. Snow-capped mountains framed the water and the shoreline\
  \ was accented with beautiful, gnarled little trees. The four of us rolled up our\
  \ pant legs and waded in, taking pleasure in shrieking as the cold turned the flesh\
  \ of our ankles and calves bright pink. I closed my eyes and breathed deep. When\
  \ I returned to Australia, there would be problems to sort through. But for now,\
  \ I was on a tiny island on the bottom half of the globe, standing in the bluest\
  \ water I'd ever seen."
