Text: "My subject will be: traditions and modernity in Buenos Aires. I would live\
  \ to speak about festivities with \"asado\",tango and sports as rugby or soccer.\n\
  \nI'm a songwriter from Barcelona and I love to travel, so I do home exchanges as\
  \ I did in Paris,London,Milan, and three times in New York.\nNowadays I'm writing\
  \ a book about my three home exchange experiences in New York: where I played in\
  \ a concert, in open mics and jams.I played baseball in Central Park and I did a\
  \ lot of good experiences.\n\nNow, The Big Apple is part of my soul and I have some\
  \ new friends who are part of my heart.\nDo you know why do you need me? I'll tell\
  \ you!\n\nBecause I'm an original and adaptable person who likes to introduce me\
  \ in new cultures, living as one more argentinian person. I'm healthy,empatic,expressive\
  \ and I always have wanted to make a tv programme about travels in a funny way with\
  \ surprising,unexpected and creative experiences.\nSo, my mother tongue is spanish.\
  \ This is very important too and I have worked as a volunteer in the newspapers\
  \ and press area of Davis Cup tournament 2000 in Barcelona. \nMoreover, I know a\
  \ lot of argentinian people because my mother has an apartment in Castelldefels,\
  \ a town near Barcelona over the sea, where you should eat in good argentinian restaurant.\
  \ I was a tennis coach there and this town is plenty of argentinian people. \n\n\
  And for finishing,I like \"Mate\",of course, and my favourite sport is soccer. I'm\
  \ a player and we have the best player in the world in Bar\xE7a team.\n\nWhat more\
  \ do you need?,\n\nEsme"
