Text: "Passport, some old canvas shoes, and a good excuse to jump on a plane - Done!\
  \ Leaving for the other side of the world to go to New Zealand was an easy decision.\
  \ After making my way through the wonderful green valleys of the North Island, it\
  \ was time to check out the southern part by taking the earliest ferry I could get.\
  \ But being young, unemployed and therefore up for any adventure that would come\
  \ my way, I couldn't stand the fact that I was stuck on this gigantic boat for 3.5hrs\
  \ with a horrible WIFI connection. What to do?\n\n\"Sorry, would you mind if I join\
  \ you in this sunny spot?\" A simple question that would lead to many more. A man\
  \ in his early-sixties, wearing a navy long sleeved-shirt and a friendly smile that\
  \ was framed by his grey beard, quickly pushed aside his belongings laying around.\
  \ Exchanging names and accents, it was the start of a conversation that made the\
  \ ferry ride go by within a blink of an eye.\n\nNigel had just come from visiting\
  \ his mother. Being used to travelling between both islands, he always has his notebook\
  \ on him to learn Mandarin. Yes, I know. Interesting, huh? Self-drawn comics about\
  \ some Chinese characters, showing each other's handwriting in different languages\
  \ and laughing about the pronunciation of certain expressions I tried to imitate.\
  \ \n\nOur conversation went deeper. We talked about the past and whatever the future\
  \ may hold for us. Naturally - me being German - history and cultural differences\
  \ were some of the topics too. As the sun above our heads slowly reached her brightest\
  \ position, there we were \u2013 sitting on this round shaped seating island on\
  \ the ferry talking about life, blending into the cacophony of noise between other\
  \ guests paying for thin coffee and overpriced souvenirs.\nAll of a sudden Nigel\
  \ put on a very serious face. He looked down on the floor like he was searching\
  \ for missing words laying around somewhere. \"You know, talking about Germany,\
  \ there's something I wanted to let you know.\" I held my breath. I could feel the\
  \ full length of every passing second. What was it that I needed to know?\n\n\u201C\
  Bratkartoffeln*\u201D, he said. \u201C\u2026 My favourite German word is Bratkartoffeln.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI looked at him with a blank expression, then we bursted out in laughter.\
  \ I was happy for two reasons: 1. We had finally made it to the South Island and\
  \ 2. Thanks to this cool stranger, I had a very pleasant conversation that is still\
  \ alive via E-Mail to this day.\n[*Fried potatoes]"
