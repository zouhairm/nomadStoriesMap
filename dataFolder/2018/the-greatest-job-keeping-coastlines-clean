Text: "\u201CI\u2019ve done a lot of things in my life, mostly for really short periods\
  \ of time,\u201D bellowed Captain Rowsan from the ship wheel, \u201Cand of all of\
  \ it, I never expected the thing I like most was picking up other people\u2019s\
  \ trash.\u201D \n\nThe captain was tall and skinny, dressed in jeans, Ray-bans and\
  \ an unwashed cobalt t-shirt. His real name was Robert. That had come out in one\
  \ of his stories. The captain told us many stories, Koharu and I, as our miniature\
  \ tug boat swirled around the crystal blue waters of Auckland\u2019s inner harbour.\
  \ We were visiting \u2018clean, green New Zealand\u2019 on an ocean conservation\
  \ project--she from Japan and I from the US. \n\nThe captain was more than local;\
  \ he knew the inlets and islands intimately. As we turned sharply, pulling into\
  \ a stop, water splashed up in our faces and we looked across the stern to see who\
  \ was more wet. If you counted locks of hair, I certainly won. \n\nThe boat still\
  \ now, the captain called us over to the side of the vessel, where he\u2019d taken\
  \ one of the kayaks out onto the water. Holding the captain\u2019s hand, we each\
  \ stepped in--I was much clumsier than Koharu with my feet. Paddles in our grasp,\
  \ the captain pointed to where we were supposed to go--under that bridge--and pushed\
  \ our kayak out away from the boat. \n\n\u201CHave you done this before?\u201D I\
  \ asked Koharu. \n\nShe hadn\u2019t. One paddle up, one paddle down. We moved along--albeit\
  \ far from in sync. The boats looked so much larger, like blown up paper cranes,\
  \ as we paddled past silently. Pointing at the bridge or other obstacles was our\
  \ main form of communication as Koharu\u2019s English was slim and my Japanese was\
  \ non-existent. It was that or let out a short squeal. \n\nBut we made it to the\
  \ rocks without problems--other than our own sluggishness. Docking, we emerged from\
  \ the kayak with garbage bags and gloves in hand. I took the top of the rocks and\
  \ my companion the bottom. The shale was slippery and moving along was something\
  \ akin to stepping stones. My trash bag grew, developing a stomach of shoes, microplastic,\
  \ straws, tampons and punctured footballs. When I tied it up, I pulled back my bangs\
  \ and looked out. I could still see some plastic, but it was better, much better.\
  \ \n\nMy arms were sore. My knees ached from my fall. Across the rocks, Koharu smiled\
  \ at me as she tied the knot off on her garbage bag. Our coastline: simple, fragile,\
  \ but oh so beautiful. How refreshing it was, picking up other people\u2019s trash."
