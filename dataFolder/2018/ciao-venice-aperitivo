Text: "\u2018Attentione!\u2019, screamed the Gondolier as he approached the pier asking\
  \ me to clear the space and interrupting my selfie. Sun had almost set, and the\
  \ lights had come on by the Rialto Bridge, Venice looked surreal. While I was grasping\
  \ my temporary new reality, I felt content with my first solo trip so far.\n\nLuca\
  \ spotted me before I could, \u2018Bounasera Praakee\u2019, he greeted me with a\
  \ smile and a kiss on my cheek. I had panicked that afternoon at the thought of\
  \ being alone in the \u2018city of love\u2019 and messaged members on Couchsurfing,\
  \ an app to meet locals. Luca had been quick to respond to my request to hangout\
  \ and had guided me to our meeting point. And there he was, dark hair, light sparkling\
  \ eyes, and a charming Italian accent.\n\nWe walked away from the crowd into tiny\
  \ streets for \u2018aperitivo\u2019. Over a very well made spritz and delicious\
  \ seafood appetizers, we dwelled in conversations about our lives. I woke up to\
  \ the traffic flowing through the veins of Mumbai while he did to the sereneness\
  \ of the water flowing in the canal. As I whined about the chaos of a big city,\
  \ his complains were around preserving the old Venetian life from the overzealous\
  \ flow of tourism.  \n\nThe next few hours, our bantering continued as we walked\
  \ around the historic centre of Venice and he marvelled me with many curious historical\
  \ anecdotes, legends, and traditions. I was thrilled to hear about the miracles\
  \ of San Marco and seeing century old stories come to life in mosaic.\n\nThe night\
  \ sky settled in, but I was bright eyed and bushy tailed. As we sipped on Prosecco,\
  \ the sweet sound of an accordion filled the air, Venice was truly magical! Our\
  \ conversation flowed through the realms of culture, history, to the mysteries of\
  \ the cosmos. What stuck with me was his narrations of the history of Venice - arrival\
  \ of the relics, the injustice of the poor baker, the old lady of mortar and many\
  \ more. I was smitten with Venice, seeing it through the eyes of a Venetian. A nervous,\
  \ unexpected journey turned into a my very own time travel through the history while\
  \ making a human connection that defies social stereotypes. \n\nEven after 3 years,\
  \ we have a unique friendship and a message from Italy always brings a smile to\
  \ my face. We met in Rome the following year and nearly missed each other in Japan\
  \ the year after. The thing about travelling is, it opens you up to endless possibilities.\
  \ Possibilities of meeting a stranger across the world and forming a long-lasting\
  \ connection. \n\nSalute!"
