Text: "We\u2019re woken up by adhan, the calling for morning payer that comes from\
  \ the mosque's minaret. It is deep, loud and persistent to start our day before\
  \ the sunrise.\nFez is a labyrinth. Alami our \u201Cfollow me\u201D guide is a man\
  \ who\u2019s age is tricky to tell, but he has been here long enough to shake hands\
  \ at least two or three times per turn. Every street, corner and abandoned house\
  \ has a story just like the luxurious \u201Csecret knock\u201D backyards and Mosques\
  \ where we're not allowed to walk in. It is his pride and joy to show us around,\
  \ because he knows just as well as we do, that there\u2019s no way we could see\
  \ that much without him. \nIf the streets were full of trash the night before, then\
  \ today they are \u201Cclean\u201D and full of little shops. The air feels thick\
  \ and busy. The scent changes from sweet spices to raw meat, eggs and cats. We see\
  \ old men drinking mint tea on the ground, while next to them someone chops off\
  \  the head of a chicken. Needless to say that our European minds have a bit of\
  \ a shock, but that seems more normal than the camel and shark heads hanging in\
  \ the local butchery. \n\u201CBonjour\u201D and \u201C\u0434\u0435\u043D\u044C \u0434\
  \u043E\u0431\u0440\u044B\u0439\u201D - literally everybody tries to get our attention\
  \ since they all have \u201Cthe best deal of the day\u201D, \u201Conly for you,\
  \ my sister\u201D. Selling is in their nature and after a while the uniqueness of\
  \ their product is lost.\nAfter two marriage proposals we reach the leather tannery.\
  \ It is the epicentre off \u201Cthe smell\u201D since they put the leather in cow\
  \ urine and pigeon poop, for the acid to make it soft like \u201Ca baby\u2019s skin\u201D\
  . This production has been maintained since medieval era and is 100% manual labor.\
  \ The view of men washing, rubbing and colouring leathers all day long in colourful\
  \ pools of liquid is something that leaves us speechless. This place looks like\
  \ we\u2019ve traveled in time. There\u2019s no white collar, but there\u2019s something\
  \ else - life, laughter and interaction. There' a sense of community. As I am taking\
  \ in the view I hear a voice behind me.\n\u201CBrother, I will give you 1000 camels\
  \ for your sister.\u201D \nIt\u2019s casual. I am a thing here. So just as casually\
  \ we move on.\nBecause it's a different world. The only thing that reminds us that\
  \ we\u2019re still on the same planet is the free wifi in cafe before we leave Fez.\
  \ Almost 90% of the people are on their phones, stuffing down camel meat burgers\
  \ as if it was chicken. Does it taste like chicken? You will have to go there and\
  \ see for yourself. The point is - it might be different world, but people cave\
  \ the same thing - to be a part of it."
