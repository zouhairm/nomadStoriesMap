Text: "I was never very interested in Bolivia. I have always loved traveling so there\
  \ is nowhere I wouldn\u2019t like to visit, but honestly, this was a country that\
  \ had never been part of my dream journeys. In fact, if one of my best friends hadn\u2019\
  t moved there, it would probably still be an unknown piece of land in a map to me\
  \ and my sister.\nThe trip we did to Isla del Sol is particularly stuck in my memory.\
  \ We were travelling to Copacabana by bus to later take a ferry to the island. As\
  \ usual, I expected to close my eyes and appear in our destination after a fantastic\
  \ nap. However, that proved to be impossible on this occasion as there were so many\
  \ things I didn\u2019t want to miss. It was a non-stop succession of curious architecture;\
  \ people who weren\u2019t travelling on the bus but used it to transport produce\
  \ to somebody else waiting a couple of blocks later; shoeshiners who covered their\
  \ faces because it\u2019s embarrassing for them to have that job and they don\u2019\
  t want to be recognized; people getting on the bus to sell several kinds of things\
  \ (snacks, short poems and photocopied books among others); signs warning criminals\
  \ that if caught, would be burnt; and stops in the middle of nowhere where old ladies\
  \ would get off (to go where, I don\u2019t know, as there weren\u2019t any buildings\
  \ in the area).\nOnce in Isla del Sol, we did a short trekking to cross the island.\
  \ Since my sister was suffering from height sickness, we advanced very slowly, and\
  \ I had time to soak up the views, the blue sky, the glistening water of the lake\
  \ and specially the lack of people and the silence. We didn\u2019t hear birds singing,\
  \ the roar of traffic or waves crashing on the shore. It was the calmest place I\
  \ have ever been to. However, it started to get darker and night fell. The term\
  \ had never been more accurate: it felt as if a thick blanket had suddenly fallen\
  \ on us preventing any light to be perceived. By the time we got to our hostel,\
  \ it was so late that we feared that there would be nobody to welcome us. Luckily,\
  \ after a short wait, a lady took us to our very modest room, where, tired after\
  \ such a long day, I felt proud of myself for having taken the determination to\
  \ travel there.\nTraveling around Bolivia was a surprisingly enriching and eye-opening\
  \ experience in so many ways that is difficult to point out exactly what made me\
  \ fall in love with it. It wasn\u2019t because I went through crazy and unbelievable\
  \ situations, it was about the small things I felt there and the Bolivian daily\
  \ life pieces I witnessed."
