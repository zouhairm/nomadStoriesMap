Text: "Half awake, in a daze \u2013 all the warnings were ringing in my ears \u2013\
  \ women...alone...at your age...shouldn't travel alone....what if.... \n\nThe place\
  \ was Nimaling \u2013 the last night of Markha valley trek. Everything was good,\
  \ as we settled to sleep  in our small tent.. But, in a short while, after some\
  \ restless tossing and turning, my friend sat upright and opened the tent. She was\
  \ feeling sick, scared and claustrophobic. Tired, sleepy and alarmed \u2013 I felt\
  \ fear and tension in my blood. \n\nWhat would I do??\n\nMe (50) and my friend (30)\
  \ chose this trek, despite very strong opposition from all corners. True, none of\
  \ us had trekked before or even travelled alone. Family, friends, tour-operaters,\
  \ fellow travellers \u2013 all tried to dissuade us \u2013 \u201Clook at your age.\u201D\
  \ \u201Conly you two \u2013 no \u2013 you should not travel alone.\u201D \u201C\
  women shouldn't travel alone.\u201D  \u201CNo mobile \u2013 what if something happens?\u201D\
  \ \n\nSome inner desire  propelled me to take the chance. I decided. She joined\
  \ in. We researched and prepared. And we took the plunge. Walking along the backdrop\
  \ of the clearest blue sky and white feathers of clouds, passing massive mountains\
  \ of unusual colours,  crossing  the river through ice-cold water, and the inviting\
  \ warmth of the homestay by the evening \u2013 I've forgotten and left behind \u2013\
  \ the old world and its customary warnings. Last night \u2013 We had almost done\
  \ it \u2013 brimming  with pride and satisfaction, we happily chatted till late\
  \ in night.\n\nAnd then, the warnings came rushing with her sickness. Sudden and\
  \ sharp \u2013  they hit me hard \u2013 like a icy-cold splash. Is this altitude\
  \ sickness?  What if it's serious? Could it be fatal? Will I fall sick too?\n\n\
  Somehow, dispelling the thoughts, I focussed on the crisis in front of me. Suddenly\
  \ my fear dissipated. I composed myself and calmed her.  My mind started thinking\
  \ clearly. I went to search for our guide. He was nowhere to be found. Cold and\
  \ worried, I went into the make-shift kitchen. The locals \u2013 cook  and helpers\
  \ were very helpful. Together we arranged our sleeping in the dining-tent. She kept\
  \ sipping water with sugar n salt. In between resting and checking on her, we survived\
  \ that long dark night. Although physically and emotionally exhausted \u2013 We\
  \ dealt with the crisis. She felt better by morning. We stretched our limits and\
  \ felt liberated. \n\nAnd, YES, breaking free of our fears, blasting the conditioning\
  \ of age and gender, we completed Markha valley full trek...women...alone...first\
  \ timers....even at 50."
