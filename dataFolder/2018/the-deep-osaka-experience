Text: "It was on a Wednesday afternoon, while wandering Osaka\u2019s busy streets,\
  \ that we met Ishida. After a small rainy outburst, much like the ones we\u2019\
  re used to experiencing back home in Dublin, we took shelter under the same street\
  \ umbrella as our friend to be and began our whimsical little adventure. Ishida\
  \ smiled and in his broken English started to chat with us. We replied in our even\
  \ more broken Japanese, filling in the gaps with some English words. Once Ishida\
  \ noticed the beer cups we were holding, he offered to take us to a drinking den\
  \ where we could get cheap prices and in the process show us a less touristy side\
  \ of Osaka, which he labelled \u2018Deep Osaka\u2019.\n\nWhile I felt ecstatic at\
  \ the prospect of being shown the city by a local, Tina, my long time friend and\
  \ traveling companion, was slightly less enthusiastic, with concerns of organ harvesting\
  \ misadventures starting to form in the back of her mind. What a team we were!\n\
  \nOn our way, Ishida told us he was a retired construction worker, while we also\
  \ told him a little about ourselves. Then we reached our destination: a little shop\
  \ with only a blue \u2018noren\u2019, traditional Japanese fabric divider, at its\
  \ doorway, selling all manner of alcohol as well as providing its customers with\
  \ a little space, containing a few standing tables, where one could have local food\
  \ and drinks. We noticed all the customers were men - most of them wearing suits.\
  \ The only women, aside from us, were a young girl and the \u2018Obasan\u2019, an\
  \ old lady who we assumed owned the establishment, both working in the shop. With\
  \ a boyish, impish smile, Ishida told us these men came here \u2018day-by-day\u2019\
  \ (every day) after work. He and the Obasan advised us on which local sake and tapas-like\
  \ dishes to sample.\n\nBefore long, we were all happily chatting together, as best\
  \ we could. We puzzled our new friends when we told them Tina was from Brazil and\
  \ I was from Portugal - how had we met with the Atlantic between us?! - which we\
  \ clarified by relating how we had worked together in Dublin. Then it was my turn\
  \ to be puzzled, by amusing our local friends, thinking one of our dishes was \u2018\
  hebi\u2019, meaning snake, (imagining myself trying new and adventurous foods),\
  \ when in fact we were eating  \u2018ebi\u2019, also known as shrimp.\n\nIt was\
  \ an unforgettable afternoon, where we felt deeply connected to the open hearted\
  \ people of Osaka. And bonus, we left with all our organs!"
