Text: "The last thing I expected to see in the wilderness surrounding the rural Japanese\
  \ town I lived in were Finnish people. I mean this is a town almost no one has heard\
  \ of, and all year I hadn\u2019t spotted any other gaijin (foreigners), so where\
  \ did the Finns come from?! \n\nLet\u2019s back up a minute. The town in question\
  \ is Koumi - a charming, mountainous area, home to  around 5000 people in the prefecture\
  \ of Nagano - smack in the middle of Japan. You haven\u2019t heard of it right?\
  \ Neither had I when I signed up to go to Japan as an English teacher. In fact I\
  \ didn\u2019t know much about Japan before I got on the plane. It\u2019s often said\
  \ there are two types of people - one who does everything possible to prepare before\
  \ a big change, while the other just dives right in and hopes for the best. I definitely\
  \ fall into the latter camp. When filling out the application form that asked me\
  \ which area of Japan I wanted to live in, I couldn\u2019t tell you why I didn\u2019\
  t just hop on the Internet and do some research. Instead I walked over to a Japanese\
  \ colleague I was working with at the time, and asked her what I should put down.\
  \ She said, \u201CUm.. do you like mountains?\u201D I said, \u201CSure they\u2019\
  re nice.\u201D And she said, \u201CYou should go to Nagano.\u201D So I wrote that\
  \ down and sent off my application. And that\u2019s how I ended up in Koumi. But\
  \ I digress. Back to the Finns.\n\nSummer in Japan is a festival bonanza. You can\u2019\
  t turn a corner without bumping into a parade dancing down the street, donning their\
  \ yukatas (summer kimonos), beating taiko (drums) and the smell of yakitori (grilled\
  \ chicken on sticks) wafting through the air. The town of Koumi has its own share\
  \ of festivals, one of them being the Finland Midsummer Festival. Why Finland, you\
  \ ask? Turns out Finland and Japan have long enjoyed a rich volume of cultural exchange,\
  \ with Friendship Societies established to promote the relationship between the\
  \ two countries. Koumi has even built a \u2018Finland village\u2019 out in the forests\
  \ near the lake, complete with log houses and saunas that are so typically Finnish.\
  \ So the Finns come along once a year to hang out, and everyone enjoys Finnish food\
  \ and drink and learns how to play the kantele (a traditional Finnish instrument).\
  \ The day ends with a dazzling bonfire lighting up the night sky, in which little\
  \ wooden gnomes are burnt\u2026 but maybe that\u2019s a story for another day. \n\
  \nI wasn\u2019t really expecting to hang out with Finns deep in the mountains, but\
  \ the beauty of Japan is you never really know what to expect."
