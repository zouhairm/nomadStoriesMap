Text: "You could feel the weight of the world at this southern protrusion of land,\
  \ wrapped like a tentacle around the base of our planet, stretched and fractured\
  \ into endless islands, untethered, wild, disorienting. I'd felt alone in prior\
  \ travels, but this was a unique sense of loneliness, like if you just kept walking\
  \ into that rocky abyss of las Torres, you'd just float away into the atmosphere,\
  \ leaving behind some spectral version of yourself hovering over it all in quiet,\
  \ eternal reflection. \n\nA day prior, I'd flown for what seemed like a lifetime\
  \ to get to Patagonia. The night prior, I'd learned that a man I never thought had\
  \ a chance was now the 45th president of my country. There was no time to reach\
  \ friends and family back home in Vermont before losing cell service completely\
  \ and beginning a three day backpacking trip into Torres Del Paine National Park.\
  \ \n\nRain tortured our steps for the first few hours of the hike and gradually\
  \ turned to snow as we set camp for the night. The camping area was compact and\
  \ about half full. We found ourselves packed into a small lean-to with a half dozen\
  \ other twenty-somethings from all walks of life. We were the first people they'd\
  \ seen who could confirm the news that had been clamoring around the trail all day.\
  \ \n\nOur conversation was heavy but uplifting. I felt the responsibility of my\
  \ country like a weight on my shoulders, as though I carried my backpack still while\
  \ we huddled together around the small fire, cooking our meager dinners in the dark.\
  \ I wished I could stay there, far away from home, with these sensible people from\
  \ all over the world. \n\nWe agreed to hike to las Torres at dawn to witness a sunrise\
  \ reflected on the tall granite edifices, the namesake of the park. A few inches\
  \ of snow canvassed the ground when we woke, and as we hiked the overcast sky broke\
  \ to the dewy mist typical of this rugged country. As the sun breached the horizon\
  \ opposite the towers, excited, echoing voices were rendered suddenly mute, and\
  \ we sat against the scattered boulders watching as the rocky faces began to glow.\
  \ \n\nTorres del Paine has been eroding away for tens of thousands of years. It\
  \ is erosion that is to thank for many of its most striking features. Magnificent\
  \ glaciers ooze like putty down the sides of these peaks, taking with them sediments\
  \ and particles, tiny pieces swept away by rock and ice. They are battered and whittled\
  \ and exposed, yet there they have stood year after year, silent and humble as the\
  \ world has changed."
