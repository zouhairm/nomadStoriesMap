Text: "The first question strangers ask me when I reveal my impending leave to a new\
  \ place is, \u201CDo you have a friend there?\u201D It is always asked with immense\
  \ trepidation. An even more horrified expression ensues when they realize I will\
  \ walk into this place stripped naked of any protective shield that companionship\
  \ provides. This reaction is a subconscious homage to connection. True connection.\
  \ It is the most important part of the human experience. We want so desperately\
  \ to be understood and loved by someone in our environment that many of us never\
  \ summon the courage to venture beyond the neighborhood where we grew up. \nI am\
  \ not like that. I get a secret thrill from walking into a room full of strangers.\
  \ I can watch interactions and relationships as an outsider. However, every so often,\
  \ I find the softness in a person that completely unbridles my theory. \nI am out\
  \ of my element. Vulnerability does that. I sat at the bar of this remote log cabin.\
  \ Massive snow-striped buttes surround us in the darkness. The wood is warm, a stark\
  \ contrast with the whipping white snow outside. The crowd has dwindled and it is\
  \ just us. We share very little in common. We were raised in different parts of\
  \ the world and speak different languages, yet we share eye contact that is intense\
  \ and unrelenting. We recognize a part within each other that we understand intimately.\
  \ He tells me that his wife has offered him an opportunity. \u201CWould you like\
  \ to have another woman?\u201D, she asked him. The defeatedness of it all puts a\
  \ crack in my belief. \u201CWhat if she is giving this to me to justify someone\
  \ else for herself?\u201D It is not a question. He has already considered it. He\
  \ is telling me because I am safe. In that instant we know each other. Our hearts\
  \ are one beating chasm. He stares off into the night, almost certainly seeing in\
  \ his mind's eye, the wife he has loved for so long in the arms of someone else.\
  \ The unexpected truth behind his eyes unseats me. It is a truth so undeniable that\
  \ it rattles in the emptiness somewhere between my hips and heart. Even if you manage\
  \ to find someone to hold for a life\u2019s worth of trials and temptations, she\
  \ can break you beyond repair. She can take the trust you share and obliterate everything\
  \ in its wake. I don\u2019t know how to answer his sadness. Just as I meet his eyes\
  \ to tell him so, the wind picks up and the lights go out. We sit there in the dark,\
  \ listening to each other's breath. In and out, using the only words of his I understand,\
  \ \xC9g elska \xFEig. I love you."
