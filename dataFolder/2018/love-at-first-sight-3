Text: "In 2015, I got this amazing opportunity that took me across Europe. For a travel-bugged\
  \ person from a small landlocked country in Asia, such as myself, it was not a small\
  \ deal. Throughout my time in Europe, I got to visit amazing places, meet amazing\
  \ people but it was this town called Bruges in Belgium that actually connected with\
  \ me, and I with the town. The moment I set foot off the train, I knew that this\
  \ place was going to be amazing-er than the other amazing places I had been to.\
  \ The narrow alleyways and canals welcomed me into the town and also led me through\
  \ the hidden treasures that the town held. \n\nThe memory of that place is still\
  \ fresh in my mind even though I do not remember what I had for breakfast earlier\
  \ today. It was a crisp cold day in November; but I remember Bruges as a warm town\
  \ in every aspect, except the weather. This was the town that successfully tickled\
  \ all of my senses. This beautiful town of beautiful people looked absolutely beautiful\
  \ by day and gorgeous by night, the smell of hot cocoa in every corner that could\
  \ only be beaten by the taste of it, the sound of horse carriages running through\
  \ the cobbled streets in narrow alleyways, the artful gothic architecture telling\
  \ history of the place; everything about the town was noteworthy to me. Not only\
  \ that, the town consists something for everyone, whether you are a chocoholic or\
  \ beer-o-holic, Bruges has just the perfect spots for you to get your fill, if you\
  \ are an art lover, Bruges hosts a number of notable art installations and museums,\
  \ if you are a people person, you are in luck, because the people there will love\
  \ you too. \n\nIt was not just how the place looked but how the place felt that\
  \ made me fall in love with Bruges. The people of Bruges is another hearty reason\
  \ why I wish to go back everyday. Polite, friendly and generous is how I would describe\
  \ every person I met in Bruges. Also, I realized that to make a local connection,\
  \ you don't necessarily have to go talk to people about local stuff, you just need\
  \ to experience them and live them. Taking a boat ride in the canals, bicycling\
  \ around the town, savoring over the waffles and fries, all helps you make a connection\
  \ to the place and people. To me the few days in Bruges was an absolute bliss and\
  \ if you decide to visit there, I promise Bruges will welcome you with the same\
  \ warmth as it did me."
