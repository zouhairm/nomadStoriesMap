Text: "I was lucky enough to be chosen to participate in the work training two years\
  \ ago.The training took place in Vienna.Even though it was for 7 days,I had a lot\
  \ that happened to me.In addition to the fact I have never been abroad,I was the\
  \ only one from KZ who was going to participate in the workshop.\nAll my worries\
  \ were related to the airports.I was afraid that I will mix up my flight,will be\
  \ late or there will be some issues with my docs.As a matter of fact,I had transit\
  \ tickets,through Istanbul. \n  I have never been to the airports before,So I was\
  \ pretty exited seing folks in a hurry there.By the time I arrive to Istanbul,I\
  \ was awake.I was in love with     Turkish language and culture.I wished If I could\
  \ stay there for a while to explore and walk the city.It is with sadness that I\
  \ said to myself that I pressed for time.\n  You have definitely got lost walking\
  \ down the streets,having lunch in the new places,so do I. For three hours I wandered\
  \ the streets of Vienna lost.After 2 days I felt at home.I am not in a habit of\
  \ going to the bed late,but during my trip to Vienna I hardly went to sleep.I decided\
  \ not to deny myself the simple pleasure of existence.So I spent evenings tasting\
  \ goodies,visiting museums and going to shopping.What better way to be a tourist\
  \ than doing these stuff?As it turned out,Vienna is very expensive city.\n  All\
  \ of a sudden I was informed that my flight from Intanbul to home was delayed for\
  \ almost a day.I was so happy that I will have a long day in Istanbul to explore\
  \ the city. I slept for 2 hours in order to save the time.Since Turkish hairdressers\
  \ are famous I decided not to lose my chance to get a haircut there.I tried to \
  \ explain to hairdresser what I want by using all my movies vocabulary. \n  All\
  \ my expenses were covered in Vienna.I wish I could say the same for Turkey.I tried\
  \ to reduce my costs there.I took the metro,visited must go places and tasted street\
  \ fast food called doner,drunk a turkish tea by the sea.\n  I figured out that all\
  \ travel stories end with some kind of change.It can be huge or very small.I had\
  \ these two different trip at once and they are totally different.It does not matter\
  \ how long your trip will last,how much many you have,what you know about this city.After\
  \ all, every place you visit will influence you in a way.  \n  Now I see the airports\
  \ as the place for new adventures, new beginnings. \n  Just keep travelling!Travel\
  \ changes us.Every time."
