Text: "It\u2019s the Valle De Ferriere, Amalfi Coast, and this is what I saw. \n\n\
  \u201CI could lament for hours, days, years. Like a paradise personified. A place\
  \ where nothing else matters but the colour of the sky, the texture of the leaves\
  \ and the direction that the water flows, that the wind blows. The longer you feasted\
  \ your eyes, the more you saw. Even the most meticulous detail became as clear as\
  \ the water of the pool you swam in, water that felt like an Arctic hug triggering\
  \ an almost orgasmic rush of blood all the way down to your toes, followed by a\
  \ feeling, a firm rival to severe pins and needles, but everywhere. It was pain,\
  \ but a good pain. These pools were not big, they didn\u2019t need to be. Venturing\
  \ closer to the top you\u2019d pass many of them, some more individual, others packed\
  \ together, but always resembling something magical, rid of all dialogue apart from\
  \ the life already residing there. It was like experiencing the healing properties\
  \ of a modern-day Mount Olympus and what felt like witnessing the history of a Forbidden\
  \ Kingdom lost long ago.\nItaly emits heat, but the further you went, the higher\
  \ you got the less you felt it. The air became breathable, cool, so out of place\
  \ to what was normal that it felt somewhat impossible.  It is the backdrop to my\
  \ perfect Utopia, the idyll Nirvana. The valley is tall, creating a pathway constructed\
  \ by nature out of a delicate but strong, shapely but unorganised chaos of stepping\
  \ stones, steps and steeply inclined slopes of land that lead the way as the centre\
  \ of the gorge, between the hills on either side. Slowly the narrow valley carves\
  \ out the minor tunnel towards the waterfall. Where the natural world is considered\
  \ luxury, this was it. A cave-like space with a high roof, endless, the blue sky.\
  \ It articulates a simple but extraordinary existence; where sunlight peers through\
  \ the cracks in the walls but also in a larger direct beam above you where the mountains\
  \ don\u2019t quite cut off daylight, but leaves a gap. It still became dark, enough\
  \ for the light that did shine through to feel like you\u2019d gone from day to\
  \ night to an enchanting sunrise. The waterfall itself is grand, water cascading\
  \ down before breaking back into the pool that lay underneath it becoming once again\
  \ mellow and unconcerned. Some found its way across the top of the waterfall and\
  \ into smaller streams that travelled down each side of the valley, before sprinkling\
  \ a misty rain, a light veil of tiny water droplets integrating back throughout\
  \ the valley."
