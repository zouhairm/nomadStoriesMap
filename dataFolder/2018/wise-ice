Text: "His movements are effortlessly smooth. Steady and self-confident he climbs,\
  \ taking his time and radiating a relaxation that is contagious. He hasn't said\
  \ much so far. Neither have I, it's not necessary. Roman, my guide today, is 74\
  \ years old, wears a traditional felt hat and a neon pair of modern sunglasses.\
  \ The edges of his kind and sly smile hide behind white, bushy sideburns.\nThe rock\
  \ around us, that had seemed rough and impermeable from afar, now reveals steps\
  \ and handles. It is, as if the mountain allows us to enter, to inhabit it temporarily.\
  \ \nWe are climbing Cima Solda, a modest peak in Southern Tyrolia. Roman stops and\
  \ looks down. He points to an area of grey rubble far below. \"There\", he says,\
  \ \"that's where the glacier ended, when I was 6 years old. And here, where we stand\
  \ now, that's where it reached when I started as a mountain guide. All gone now.\"\
  \ He spares me a clumsy reply, turns and continues his steady pace uphill. I look\
  \ up, to where blue and black tongues of ice are reaching into the rock. It makes\
  \ me sad, that something so frighteningly massive has withdrawn into nothingness.\
  \ \nOnce we have reached the glacier my eyes become fixed to Romans feet. His crampons\
  \ touch the ice almost tenderly, his steps are silent. He is home. Black abysses\
  \ rupture the white glory of the old ice. Smudges of dirt cover the surface. But\
  \ there is this vulnerability in the dripping, tender, blue-turquoise edges of the\
  \ crevasses. They fold into the surface of the ice, like worry lines on an old face.\
  \ This ambivalence moves me deeply. Roman has stopped to look into a stream. I sense\
  \ a sadness from him. The very material of the glaciers existence is digging a winding\
  \ creek through its ancient body. Gargling, splashing and whirling it tells its\
  \ story of impending doom in a curiously cheerful tone. Romans life and character\
  \ are etched by the landscape around us. We smile at each other briefly, as if to\
  \ confirm that it's okay to just stand here. As I watch the water, time is losing\
  \ its shape and meaning. Instead I feel my heart beating in a steady rhythm that\
  \ is connected to everything around me. \nRoman looks at me and chuckles in an almost\
  \ boyish way. I know he sees me. As we continue our ascent, I finally understand\
  \ what makes me want to laugh and cry at the same time: The mountains are allocating\
  \ a place for me, that I couldn't have chosen better. That I might not even know\
  \ existed, without them. It I follow Romans wise pace and I am filled with pristine\
  \ gratitude."
