Text: "Flying Alone\n\u2018Mom, I just landed!\u2019\nNervously I follow the couple\
  \ that was sitting opposite me. The guy was wearing a beautiful fitted blue suit\
  \ with a traditional head-wrap. He was carrying something that looked like a mini\
  \ spear, which gave me the impression that maybe he was a chief. The girl kept catching\
  \ me stealing glances at her boyfriend and every time she would draw closer to him.\
  \ I felt sorry for her, she looked like those typical \u201Cbeauty but no brains\u201D\
  \ type of girl that only has her beauty and vagina to offer. Still trying to look\
  \ like I knew where I was going, I grab my suitcase and start to wonder about the\
  \ airport.\nI walk out through the shiny glass doors, and I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ my eyes! There it was, standing tall and majestic, commanding all the respect.\
  \ The wind was like its halo. My jaw dropped to the ground. The pre-eminent Table\
  \ Mountain welcomed me to the \u2018Mother City\u2019.\nI showed the bus driver\
  \ my address on my phone and he showed me to the Oranjezicht bus. The journey took\
  \ a good 30min to town and all these places we were driving past looked exactly\
  \ like how I\u2019d seen them on TV: the brightly beautifully painted houses, the\
  \ white sand and the harsh wind. It was a relatively hot day, but I felt a strong\
  \ need for my cardigan. Durban is very warm. I had a lot of adjusting to do ahead\
  \ of me. \nThe driver shouts \u2018Adderly Street\u2019 and looks at me through\
  \ the rear-view mirror. I get off the bus. \n\u201CHey you\u201D she hugs me and\
  \ takes my bag. \u201CMy name is Zama, I\u2019ll keep your bag with me and you can\
  \ go sort out your life\u201D, she consoled. \u201CIf you get lost, just ask the\
  \ security\u201D\nI walked to the Cape Peninsula University of Technology Bellville\
  \ campus and asked the fat guy at the helpdesk for the Science Faculty. He looked\
  \ annoyed after all I was disturbing him while he was enjoying his juicy beef burger.\
  \ He punched on his computer and signalled with his hand for me to come and look\
  \ on the screen. He showed me a picture of a map and with food I his mouth, he said\
  \ we\u2019re here, pointing somewhere on the map, and you should go there. I gave\
  \ him a blank look and walked away.\nThat was a complete waste of my time. I had\
  \ no idea where I was, now somebody showing me directions through the map that I\
  \ couldn\u2019t even recognize was VERY helpful.\nI walked to the security guard\
  \ who saw from my gait that I was not from the area. He gave the directions to the\
  \ Science Faculty and gave me his number. He sent me text with the names of people\
  \ that I should contact for any assistance."
