Text: "Lines are slipping from U Wisein into U Wisara into Bo Gyoke Road as the map\
  \ rotates madly in my hands. I look for Sule Pagoda and see plastic tables beneath\
  \ moulding British buildings, selling fried entrails. \u201CDon\u2019t panic if\
  \ you work out someone\u2019s following you,\u201D my expat friend Emma\u2019s words\
  \ ring, \u201Cit\u2019s just the government spying on you.\u201D I cross the road.\
  \ \n\nSquinting at the map, I hear a sparrow-like voice:\n\u201CWhere you want to\
  \ go?\u201D \nA lady in an orange silk longyi stands close.\n\u201CSule pagoda,\
  \ this way?\u201D I point down the road. \n\u201CYes, Sule Pagoda there. You follow\
  \ me.\u201D\nShe\u2019s like Aung San Suu Kyi, all cheekbones and slenderness with\
  \ hair in a soft updo. \n\u201CCome?\u201D \n\u201CWhat is your name?\u201D I ask\
  \ over a few people\u2019s heads. \n\u201CMyat,\u201D she turns back, \u201Cwhat\
  \ is yours?\u201D\n\u201CClaudia.\u201D\nShe trots ahead. \u201CWhat is your country?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CAustralia.\u201D\n Myat slows to my side. \u201CWhy are you in Myanmar?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CTo visit my friend,\u201D I explain, \u201Cfrom university.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Why is she in Myanmar?\u201D \n \u201CFor her job. She works in Yangon, making websites\
  \ for an NGO.\u201D \n\u201CNGO? Which NGO?\u201D \n \u201CADRA. Do you know it?\u201D\
  \n\u201CNo, not this one.\u201D She shakes her head.\n\nWe come to a four-lane crossing.\
  \ Myat steps into it, arms outstretched, and calls: \u201CCross!\u201D \nWe resume.\n\
  \u201CWhat else are you do in Myanmar?\u201D\n\u201CWe\u2019re going to Bagan and\
  \ Inle Lake on the weekend, I\u2019m very happy!\u201D\n\"How you get to Bagan?\u201D\
  \n \u201CWe will ride the bus.\u201D\nSule Pagoda is suddenly close. The pathway\
  \ is flooded with pigeons pecking at tribute rice. Its two-millennium-old golden\
  \ spire holds one of Buddha\u2019s hairs, and tickets are triple price for foreigners.\
  \ We amble around the spire, hands tucked behind our backs. \n\u201CWhat is your\
  \ job?\u201D Myat\u2019s eyes fix on the spire. \n \u201CI\u2019m a student. I study\
  \ teaching.\u201D \n \u201CAh, teaching.\u201D She looks to the ground.\n\u201C\
  What about you?\u201D I ask, \u201Cwhat is your job?\u201D\nShe says nothing. Golden\
  \ Buddhas dot the walls, each hallowed with flashing blue lights and gazing devotees.\
  \ Myat pauses at one, produces an orchid stem and bows. We leave, passing computer\
  \ shops and bored taxi drivers. \n\u201CI can show you city,\u201D Myat offers\n\
  \u201CCome drink tea. Meet my boyfriend, from Germany!\u201D her eyes shine, eager\
  \ like a schoolgirl\u2019s. She trots off down a narrow street, shadowed by moulding\
  \ buildinsgs.\n\u201CCome!\u201D\nI follow, brain screaming, until my feet halt.\n\
  \u201CMyat, thank you for taking me to Sule, I must go.\u201D \nShe shrugs and skips\
  \ down the street. \n\nAt home, I ask Emma about my afternoon with Myat:\n\u201C\
  Do you think she was a spy?\u201D \n\u201CNo,\u201D she smirks, \u201Conly men are\
  \ spies.\u201D"
