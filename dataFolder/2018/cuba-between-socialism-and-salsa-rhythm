Text: "That year we went to dive into the morbid charm of La Havana, get the salsa\
  \ rhythm in our blood. Were looking forward to find out how one of our former \"\
  brothers\" is doing. Wanted to get in touch with Cubans and get an idea how GDR\
  \ might have looked like without the peaceful revolution.\n\nNever expecting how\
  \ much this experience will burn itself into our memories. Still struggling for\
  \ words to describe how we felt. Shocked? Surprised? Ashamed? Fascinated? No clue!\n\
  \n\"Cuba, quiero bailar la Salsa\", isn't how Cuba presented itself to us at all.\n\
  \nWhat we saw were shabby houses, broken cars, bent bicycles, giant potholes and\
  \ the most stunning beaches we had seen by this time. What a contrast!\n\nAnd the\
  \ Cubans, the Cubans were always in a good mood, never complaining. But dancing\
  \ in the streets? No, no we saw none. \n\nSpeaking Spanish and being from former\
  \ GDR was the door opener per se.  Getting into conversations had always something\
  \ bitter sweet. One family member had to double check, that nobody is harking outside.\
  \ Talking that open to foreigners always had the potential risk of being calumniated.\
  \ We felt guilty in a certain way to bring them in such a precarious situation,\
  \ but it felt so good to get to know about all the facets. Inquisitive like a first\
  \ grader we squeezed all information out.   \n\nLearning all about the food - voucher\
  \ - system, made us stop eating rice at the Bed & Breakfasts (casas particulares).\
  \ Never asked again for another piece of butter or an egg. \n\nWho would assume\
  \ they have the most educated doctors and a very high standard of education in general?\
  \ But what is it worth when you don't have the techniques? \n\nLiving with all these\
  \ limitations, being banished from the most beautiful beaches in the world, I admire\
  \ the Cubans. I admire them for their positivism, how they deal with it and how\
  \ less they wish. All Cubans we talked to, had just one wish - freedom, the freedom\
  \ to travel, not more!\n\nKnowing how it is, to be captured in your country, not\
  \ being allowed to see the world or even family, we felt with them. \n\nSo our memories\
  \ about Cuba are somewhere between sky-high shouting for joy & saddened to death.\
  \ \n\nUsing their own slogan, is all I have to say now:  \xA1Viva Cuba libre!"
