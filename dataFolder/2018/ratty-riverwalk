Text: "Vivid. That\u2019s the best word I can use to describe my experience in the\
  \ Big Easy\u2019s famed cultural and party district, the French Quarter. On an unusually\
  \ quiet spring evening, my friends and I leisurely pedaled our bicycles through\
  \ the residential area of the district. We admired houses coated with yellow, pink,\
  \ and blue pastel hues. Residents sat nonchalantly on their porches or balconies,\
  \ enjoying a comfortable evening. The air was humid and calm. The streets were even\
  \ calmer\u2026 Or so we thought. \n\nWhen we finally wandered to the nearby Mississippi\
  \ River we were met with an unruly sight. In stark contrast to the previous scene,\
  \ an intoxicated female twenty-something was squatting on the river bank with her\
  \ skirt pulled up and her underwear on the ground. She was taking a dispassionate\
  \ poop. We awkwardly made eye contact, but she was unperturbed. Perhaps this was\
  \ a regular routine. Baffled, we continued to walk along the waterfront and away\
  \ from Miss Excrement.  \n\nThomas, Jesse, and I proceeded to sit on a bench and\
  \ admire the vastness of the river. A rustling noise was heard in an adjacent trashcan.\
  \ \u201CWhat was that?\u201D we wondered. An oleaginous creature swiftly emerged\
  \ from the bowels of the garbage can. It scuttled down the metal rails, sprinted\
  \ across the walking path, and hid in the grass. Beady eyes poked through the damp\
  \ blades of greenery. The animal waited cautiously and then scurried back to the\
  \ trashcan. Upon further examination, we realized the creature was a rat. With ease,\
  \ the rodent climbed back to the top and dropped inside for a late-night snack.\
  \ Jesse aptly named the rodent, \u201CPat the Garbage Rat.\u201D We began cracking\
  \ jokes and analyzing the rat\u2019s every move. \n\nTo many, rats are grotesque\
  \ animals with little to admire. However, for us, this rodent was a source of entertainment.\
  \ Being from Alberta\u2014proudly proclaimed a \u201Crat-free province\u201D\u2014\
  the resourcefulness of the rat impressed us. Travelling inadvertently broadens your\
  \ perspective both in trivial and meaningful ways. I can\u2019t say that admiring\
  \ a rat or witnessing a woman poop on the side of the Mississippi River were necessarily\
  \ enlightening experiences. However, what I can say is that stumbling upon something\
  \ foreign is memorable. I\u2019m sure one day my friends and I will reminisce about\
  \ Pat the Garbage Rat. For better or for worse, these images, sounds, and feelings\
  \ will be etched into our brains for years to come. It\u2019s these unusual experiences\
  \ that form the foundation of an unforgettable trip."
