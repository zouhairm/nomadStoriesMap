Text: "I knew nothing more about it than the Cuban cigars, confusing the events of\
  \ her complex political history, I read in Wikipedia that the river Menderes penetrates\
  \ the city from north to south and I saw that day and when I  vised it penetrate\
  \ my heart too.\n On my first day I encountered great difficulty because everyone\
  \ did not speak English, I did not meet anyone who speaks English. I have used sign\
  \ language, and I do not know where this will lead me, I pointed to a taxi driver\
  \ and with great difficulty tried to tell him that I wanted to go to the hotel.\
  \ I was so angry I could not get the information well. Suddenly, I found myself\
  \ outside a taxi and paid twenty dollars as requested by the driver , I looked to\
  \ the right, to the north and everywhere\" I was looking for a hotel as I was trying\
  \ to tell the driver and I really did not find any hotel where a taxi driver left\
  \ me\", there is a nightclub just at the end of the street.  An elderly lady walks\
  \ across the street and refers to me, I understand she refer me to where I sleep.\n\
  I found myself in the morning. I woke up and she called me for breakfast ,We did\
  \ not understand each other. But I  decided to pay her for my stay.. We do not speak\
  \ the same language but Over time, my relationship with the old lady and her family\
  \ became a wonderful friendship, A doctor, a teenager, an old lady and me, in the\
  \ same house.\nI went with the boy to a downtown nightclub, everyone here was dancing\
  \ brilliantly, I did not speak or move like others, did not integrate into the dance,\
  \ I saw a beautiful girl advancing towards me and holding my dance and helping me.\
  \ I told her I was not good at dancing. I did not speak Spanish well, smelled her\
  \ perfume, her hair combed carefully and simply, made me enter the general atmosphere\
  \ of the place, started my feet moving without knowing and interacting with the\
  \ salsa rhythms simply and spontaneously. We laughed and danced and walked together\
  \ on the way back home and I put a big kiss on her cheek, The language was not the\
  \ means to contact us, it was something else, and I wish I knew then. The truth\
  \ is that I began to represent everything I wanted. It's better to tell others what\
  \ I wanted. I took great care of the look on my face because this look will make\
  \ others know what I felt or wanted.\n I knew I was somehow integrated into dance,\
  \ moved with others until I became without feeling mastered dancing,   So life is\
  \ an enjoyable salsa dance,"
