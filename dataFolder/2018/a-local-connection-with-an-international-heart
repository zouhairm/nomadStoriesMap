Text: "\u201CAlways a schlep coming here,\u201D the grey-haired man seated beside\
  \ Liz said with a chuckle.\nSheepishly, she nodded in agreement and mustered a meek\
  \ smile.\n\u201CI\u2019m visiting my daughter and her husband in Russia,\u201D the\
  \ man continued before adding proudly, \u201Cthey\u2019re pregnant.\u201D\n\u201C\
  That\u2019s wonderful,\u201D Liz replied warmly. \n\u201CYour first time abroad?\u201D\
  \ the man asked with an expectant grin. \nThe question made her thoughts drift to\
  \ the chilly winter\u2019s morning that changed her life forever. \nLiz was taken\
  \ aback when the attractive, slightly rugged man introduced himself at Cape Town\u2019\
  s crowded station. \n\u201CWhat takes you to Bellville?\u201D he asked.\n\u201C\
  Job interview,\u201D she replied. \nLiz had her sights set on becoming a hotshot\
  \ journalist. \nShe checked her watch again, nervously tapping her foot on the train\u2019\
  s filthy floor. \n\u201CLiz,\u201D he said reassuringly. \u201CThe trains were delayed\
  \ and there\u2019s nothing you can do. It is what it is.\u201D \nTwo months later\
  \ there hung a heavy haze of hostility in Liz\u2019s family\u2019s home.\nHer father\
  \ was an obstinate man, unwavering in his beliefs and rarely willing to compromise.\
  \ \nLiz yearned for him to accept her relationship with Acel, but he wouldn\u2019\
  t budge. \nLiz spent the next day crying inconsolably, rereading the texts between\
  \ her and Acel.\n\u201CHow badly are you bruised?\u201D she wrote him minutes after\
  \ he fled their property. \n\u201CI\u2019m fine, Liz. Nothing as badly bruised as\
  \ my ego.\u201D \n\u201CI want to be with you!\u201D\n\u201CMe too. But it is what\
  \ it is.\u201D \nWith Acel gone for good, Liz reluctantly moved on with her life.\n\
  A year had passed when she found herself in an icy little Russian town called Oymyakon.\n\
  She was sent to cover the village\u2019s unusually extensive blizzards and freezing\
  \ temperatures. \nCraving a steamy cuppa, she hunted down the town\u2019s best coffee\
  \ shop.\nLiz was about to place her order when she heard the barista tell a gentleman\
  \ in front of her they weren\u2019t serving flavoured coffee due a delivery shortage.\
  \ \nIt must've been a regular customer because the apologetic barista went on to\
  \ give a lengthy explanation. \n\u201CAg, it is what it is,\u201D the customer replied.\
  \ \nLiz went cold. No, she told herself, it couldn\u2019t be.\nThe man turned around\
  \ to leave. \n\u201CNext please,\u201D she heard a woman call out.\n\u201CMa\u2019\
  am? Hello?\u201D the voice came again, this time clearly irritated. \nLiz looked\
  \ up to see she had reached the front of the line. \nSorry, she mouthed and gestured\
  \ for the woman to wait. She turned to the grey-haired man beside her: \u201CI\u2019\
  m here to start my life with the man I love.\""
