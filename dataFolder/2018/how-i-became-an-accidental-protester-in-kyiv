Text: "While I was living in Kyiv I received this text from a friend of mine \u2018\
  Would you like to see the inner workings of the Ukrainian political machine?\u2019\
  . I had travelled to Ukraine for this exact purpose and I responded with an optimistic\
  \ \u2018Yes, of course!\u2019. Little did I know that the next morning I would find\
  \ myself a part of the machine. \n\nI met my friend at the meeting point on Kyiv\u2019\
  s main square. More and more \u2018protesters\u2019 began to arrive and I realised\
  \ that these people were not the youthful and energetic activists which I had expected.\
  \ Hundreds of pensioners poured in from every direction and congregated in beige\
  \ swarms around the square. \n\nSoon, the \u2018coordinators\u2019 of the protest\
  \ began to arrive, they were mostly glamorous young women who clutched expensive\
  \ looking handbags. These \u2018coordinators\u2019 screamed at the pensioners to\
  \ organise into a column, a cohort was quickly formed which straddled the square\
  \ from end to end. I found myself assigned to a group of five elderly men, using\
  \ my broken Russian I managed to find out that we were about to march up towards\
  \ the bank of Ukraine and stage a protest there. \n\nA girl in her early twenties\
  \ came over to us and waved her expensive phone like a baton, she ordered us to\
  \ march up the hill. Slowly, the beige column of pensioners worked its way up the\
  \ hill, some men wore grey suits, they looked like Soviet bureaucrats. The women\
  \ wore summer dresses and some looked like they had just come from their Dacha,\
  \ they wore gardening gloves and brown headscarves. \nWhen we arrived at the bank\
  \ of Ukraine the column dispersed, and the pensioners started snacking on homemade\
  \ sandwiches. I asked my friend what we were supposed to do now and he replied \u2018\
  Wait'. So we waited, but as my friend explained, we were not permitted to leave\
  \ the protest area or we would not receive our \u2018compensation\u2019. \n\nAfter\
  \ waiting for around 5 hours in the hot Kyiv sun we were then ordered to congregate\
  \ in the nearby underground shopping mall, this is when the strangest of things\
  \ happened. Somehow, the young girl who was assigned to me had memorised the faces\
  \ of everyone she was responsible for. She walked up to me while I was loitering\
  \ on a bench, taking advantage of the free Wi-Fi, and handed me an envelope with\
  \ the word \u2018compensation\u2019 written on it. Inside was a bank note worth\
  \ around $1. That\u2019s when I realised that I had accidentally taken part in a\
  \ legendary \u2018paid protest\u2019 and had earned $1 for a days work."
