Text: "It began in a small town, just a short train journey from home and while this\
  \ seems to be not so far to travel for a story based upon adventure, I found it\
  \ myself an incredible journey a long way from comforts within my small family home\
  \ embellished by fields and beautiful wildlife. In short, this story is not just\
  \ adventure beyond the mundane lifestyle I'd accustomed to, but rather a terrifying\
  \ leap to develop into a stronger person. \nBirdcall is a magical morning alarm,\
  \ setting your mind a world apart filled with hope and magic ready to embrace each\
  \ day with a new prospective. Nothing seems impossible when a mind is freed by nature,\
  \ however this soon changed in the year 2014 as discovery and challenge were afoot.\n\
  Never had I imagined myself living in a house as a self-proclaimed geek and music\
  \ lover living with three girls on a dance course; this arose to me to be exciting\
  \ and absolutely frightening! We cohabited harmoniously (mostly), regular house\
  \ parties and pizza nights, all after a day's 'hard' work at university. Until,\
  \ I was struck by the most corrosive and volatile feeling I'd ever been unfortunate\
  \ to come across, homesickness. Lingering notion of emptiness and void within my\
  \ soul which no amount of pizza or nights out could overcome, I tried several methods\
  \ and techniques, usually long walks discovering the countryside not far from the\
  \ bustling streets to bring myself to peace and as these got more regular, the anxieties\
  \ and stress withered.\nA journey is a venture through high\u2019s and low\u2019\
  s and that\u2019s exactly how it happened, strength to strength on each walk, night\
  \ out and lecture I grew a close group of friends who would regularly invite myself\
  \ and housemate to Dungeons and Dragons which is where the real changes began! Little\
  \ by little, each session would obscure my vision of reality and introduce new perspectives\
  \ on the world, a sensational rhythm of joy to carry. As a high elf of Mirealark,\
  \ duties must be fulfilled to maintain the status of city guild and ensure no sentient\
  \ beings caused disturbance. Night by night, we treaded carefully around misty mountains,\
  \ collecting artefacts from a world once unknown to modern civilization and conquered\
  \ trolls and villains galore with our wisdom and dexterity intact! A fruitful partnership\
  \ formed alongside a hungry yearning to travel and explore new realms as I did so\
  \ many nights as a high elf and this is all made possible by fighting, doing what\
  \ makes you happy and encouraging others to do the same."
