Text: "For the past 6 days we had been driving across Turkey and finally we were close\
  \ to the Georgia border. So very close, except suddenly, our car wouldn\u2019t start.\
  \ \n\nA group of men watched as we tried to start the ignition, curiously gazing\
  \ at the rare visitors. After many attempts, we admitted defeat and approached our\
  \ gawkers. We needed a \u201Cmachina master\u201D. They knew just the man, Emir.\
  \  \n \nDown dusty backroads, we were led to an alley lined with closed garages.\
  \ The men knocked on the first shop. An older man hobbled out. A cigarette hung\
  \ from his mouth as he stared us down. He had gray hair, a stubbly white beard,\
  \ and a wrinkled tan face. His coarse hands were a tribute to decades of repairs.\
  \ \n\nAlthough closed, Emir agreed to help us and went straight to work, toiling\
  \ under the hood of our car. Shortly after he approached us, ready to give the prognosis.\
  \ In one hand he held the car\u2019s starter. The other hand gestured slicing his\
  \ neck. It was dead.\n\nTaking a break, Emir invited me to join him in the shop\u2019\
  s back office. He signaled me to sit on a worn out couch against the wall. Like\
  \ a true Turkish gentleman he offered me tea.  We sat in silence at first, slowly\
  \ sipping our drinks. It was clear he wanted to initiate conversation, but all he\
  \ could do was wave at my glass and offer a refill. \n\nI noticed a large world\
  \ map on the wall and with my best charades attempted to show him my trip route.\
  \  I traced where I had drove from, all the way in Liverpool. My finger continued\
  \ down the long road ahead to \u2018Mongolistan\u2019, a land so far away. Emir\u2019\
  s eyes were wide open, his mouth dropped in awe - he had never even been to Istanbul.\
  \  \n\nHe suddenly rose and handed me two new wooden fold-able chairs. Beaming,\
  \ he explained that he made them himself, pointing out their details and durability.\
  \  They were a gift for my journey. I wanted to decline, he already was fixing my\
  \ car, how could I accept another gift? But he was persistent and I could see how\
  \ much this gift meant to him. He wanted to be a part of my grand adventure, so\
  \ I accepted the benches, leaving his tiny shop with more than I had arrived with.\n\
  \nFour weeks later, in the Mongolian Steppe, I couldn\u2019t help but think of Emir.\
  \ Two children from a nearby yurt had come to visit our campsite. As they ran around\
  \ laughing and playing with our belongings, I knew I couldn\u2019t let them go home\
  \ empty handed. I gave each kid a chair and watched their faces light up. My trip\
  \ was about to end, but the gift of the chairs could live on."
