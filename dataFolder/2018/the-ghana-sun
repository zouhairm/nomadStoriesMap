Text: "I hopped off the bus and stretched after a long 6 hour journey. I made my way\
  \ down the main street of Gbledi, squinting up at the searing Ghana sun. A drop\
  \ of sweat slid down my neck as I eagerly walked toward my accommodation. It took\
  \ me about 45 minutes before I realized I was lost. I shrugged it off as it was\
  \ still fairly early in the afternoon and instead of getting help, I found a nice\
  \ spot, perched underneath a large shrub and shaded from the scorching sun. I accidentally\
  \ lost myself in reading for almost 3 hours. I stood up, a bit shaky on my feet\
  \ and a lot more tired than before. The sun was a lot closer to the horizon now,\
  \ a deep colour of orange as it hung above a wispy grey cloud. It wouldn\u2019t\
  \ be long before it set. I was nervous knowing I had yet to find my bed for the\
  \ night. I was so sure it was that way\u2026 Another hour passed and I was concerned.\
  \ The streets were quiet now. My feet dragged along the dirt path leaving crevices\
  \ in the dusty surface. I was growing hungrier with every step and slowly becoming\
  \ exhausted.  \n \u201CHello!\u201D A voice bellowed from across the street. \u201C\
  You look like you can use a cup of tea.\u201D I squinted through the impending darkness\
  \ and just managed to make out the silhouette of a man through the candle light.\
  \ His English was spoken slowly, but confidently; he was easy to understand even\
  \ through the thick accent. He gestured for me to come. I was apprehensive but approached\
  \ him with a smile. \u201CHello there,\u201D I said before introducing myself. He\
  \ then introduced himself as Sabul. His eyes were warm and his smile wide. \"Here,\
  \ drink this,\" he said. \"Feel good.\" I smell the cup and grasp a hint of ginger.\
  \ I sip tentatively. Immediately my taste buds explode with an overwhelming bitterness.\
  \ I struggle to keep my eyes open from the taste. It was like biting into a lemon\
  \ dipped in citric acid. Sensing my discomfort, Sabul laughed and gave me a firm\
  \ pat on my shoulder. \u201CBitter is better. The Western World has forgotten how\
  \ to eat\u2026 forgotten about the herbs.\u201D I felt very grateful to have met\
  \ Sabul and I told him that before asking if he could point me towards the town\
  \ centre. Sabul shook his head. He said there was a bed for me inside and that it\
  \ would be much safer for me to travel after sunrise. I was so thankful. He offered\
  \ me some bread before I slept and left me with a drink of water and a length of\
  \ foam on which to rest my head. The next morning I left, feeling unbelievably lucky\
  \ such a gentle man had helped me in a time of need."
