Text: "\u201CIt's like a f***ing warm bath\u201D the lady said. I was sceptical. As\
  \ much as I wanted to believe that this lady with her Jack Russell and 30 year-old\
  \ faded denim jeans was indeed a local who knew the best swimming spots along the\
  \ river, a very small, microscopic part of me wondered why she would share such\
  \ an idyllic location with this odd group of young adults, their not quite so young\
  \ parents, and a dog. It was this same small, microscopic part of me that wondered\
  \ if we were perhaps being led down the garden path - both figuratively and literally.\
  \ I mentioned this to my sister as we followed Meg down the dusty 4WD track, but\
  \ she just laughed, saying that watching NARCOS had made me lose faith in humanity.\
  \ After all \u2013 this was New Zealand. \n\nJanuary in New Zealand is my favourite\
  \ time of year. It is the peak of summer, and for Christchurch, a city lying on\
  \ the east coast of the South Island, this time of year brings with it air that\
  \ falls heavy with heat of the kind that doesn't disappear, but instead lasts for\
  \ days on end. It was against this backdrop that I found myself following the lady\
  \ with the Jack Russell down a 4WD track skirting the banks of the Waimakariri River.\
  \ \n\nThe Waimakariri flows down from the Southern Alps, gifting the riverbed with\
  \ various amounts of gravel sediment and sulphates as its waters make their way\
  \ to the sea. The effect of this is that the soil along the river's edge becomes\
  \ rich, and the willow trees that line the riverbed look like they've been taking\
  \ protein shakes. As Meg led us off the 4WD track and into the willows their leaves\
  \ were like a disco ball sprinkling circles of light onto the forest floor, and\
  \ while Meg's jeans remained a faded blue and the odd mushroom along the ground\
  \ a beige, the were the only outliers in this green room I had found myself in.\
  \ \n\nSoon enough Meg pulled back the curtains of the willow trees branches, and\
  \ we arrived at the real show. There was the \"f***ing warm bath\" that she had\
  \ promised - an expanse of water that glistened in the afternoon sun. As we lay\
  \ there, Meg and I, star-fishing side by side, I thought - to float in water really\
  \ is bliss. It is like you are freed from any earthly ties you have, and instead\
  \ it is just you and the water molecules making room for you, there together, with\
  \ no other purpose but to be. I don\u2019t know how long I floated there for. It\
  \ could have been hours, although it was probably only minutes. Water has a habit\
  \ of distorting time, especially in a warm bath."
