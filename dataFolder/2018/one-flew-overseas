Text: "When the day finally came, I was excited and nervous. I had never been on the\
  \ other side of security, never been outside of Oregon much, and I never dreamed\
  \ I would push myself off the edge of my comfort zone. \n\n After our airplane landed,\
  \ we got in a bus to Waldshut in Germany, were my class was going to stay. Driving\
  \ through all the towns was amazing. It felt like being lost in an alternate universe.\
  \ It looked like my town back home, except the some of the buildings were traditional\
  \ and the signs were in German.     \n\n After that we traveled to a town called\
  \ Rotenburgh. It was the most beautiful place I have ever seen. It looked like it\
  \ came right out of a fairytale book, with towers reaching to the sky. We stayed\
  \ there for three days, and it was the best time I of my life before or since. One\
  \ night for fun, we walked the wall that surrounded the town. It was so peaceful,\
  \ and amazing knowing that I was walking on the same wood that had been there for\
  \ hundreds of years. It was an experience I have never felt in my home U.S.A, especially\
  \ on the West Coast where everything is new. Later we walked to the top of the highest\
  \ tower. I can\u2019t describe how it changed me. I felt as if I could see the whole\
  \ world, it was so vast.\n\n After that life changing moment, was another soon to\
  \ come. We went to the main amusement park called Europa-Park. Now before this point,\
  \ I had only been to small local amusement parks, and I was really scared of roller\
  \ coasters. That day I made the decision to face my fear. We waited in line for\
  \ a long hot and sticky 30 minutes, and I have never felt more anxious. The moment\
  \ of dread finally came, I was almost shaking as I felt the holster lock down. It\
  \ started the suspenseful climb up the track. Oh, I thought I was going to die.\
  \ Then I looked down, the world was getting farther and farther away. Then I felt\
  \ my mind switch, I suddenly felt calm. I couldn\u2019t understand it. It was similar\
  \ to the tower in Rothenburg, all of my troubles seemed inconsequential in comparison\
  \ to the world, which is why I want to see as much of it as I can. Going to Germany\
  \ was by far the best thing I\u2019ve ever done, and by far the best medicine I\
  \ have ever taken."
