Text: "Have you ever wondered what I would be like to accomplish one of your biggest\
  \ travel goals? I have. And I need to admit last June I felt like one of the happiest\
  \ girls on Earth  when I bought a ticket from Europe to Peru for 200 dollars. Yep,\
  \ for 200 dollars, that\u2019s not a typing error :)\nEveryone asks me: how did\
  \ you find out your passion for the Spanish language and interest in Latin America?\
  \ To be honest, I think there is no correct answer. I would love to say that I woke\
  \ up one day and screamed loudly \u201Chey, I\u2019ve just found the true passion\
  \ of my life!\u201D, but it didn\u2019t really work like that. Although I was born\
  \ and raised in Poland, I believe a piece of my heart has always belonged to Latin\
  \ America. To its culture, its history, its joy of life. By the way, I bet I was\
  \ a Maya princess some lives ago, I bet I was. \nWhen I booked a ticket, my boyfriend\
  \ and I literally started counting down the days till our flight. I knew it was\
  \ going to be legen -wait for it- dary! I couldn\u2019t wait to see Machu Picchu,\
  \ and the beauty of the Peruvian nature. I was so looking forward to drink Inka\
  \ Kola for the first time and start my nearly 2-days-lasting jungle trekking. Oh,\
  \ I think I looked happier that ever on a Christmas shopping. \nAs we all know,\
  \ time goes by too so fast. Before I knew it, we were in Peru, walking down the\
  \ street in Cuzco, shopping at a local market, picking up a handful of coffee beans,\
  \ and searching for a restaurant that served an alpaca steak. Everything went a\
  \ bit too perfect, that\u2019s why I decided to add some spice to my life and\u2026\
  \ buy me an ice cream. Living on the edge!  \nUnfortunately, my body didn\u2019\
  t feel the same excitement. Suddenly I got a fever, I could hardly walk, I started\
  \ to refuse food and water. Pretty weird symptoms of a person who was preparing\
  \ for their dream trip to Machu Picchu, aren\u2019t they? My boyfriend took me to\
  \ the closest emergency room as soon as possible. \u201CIt\u2019s a serious food\
  \ poisoning!\u201D, a doctor said. They put me on a drip and told me to that probably\
  \ I would not be able to go to the ancient Inca ruins the next day. \nOh, c\u2019\
  mon, I couldn\u2019t imagine not going there. Although I felt tremendously weak,\
  \ I took medications as prescribed by the doctor and decided to take a bus to Machu\
  \ Picchu. But can you imagine what was the last thing I expected? Nope, neither\
  \ our driver took a poor rute and got lost, nor the entrance was closed. \nThe truth\
  \ is that I went to Machu Picchu with my boyfriend, but I left it with my fianc\xE9\
