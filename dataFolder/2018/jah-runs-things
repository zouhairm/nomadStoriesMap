Text: "The old green pick-up crawled onwards, tired engine revving hard as we began\
  \ the final ascent on a heavily potholed road towards the Freshwater Lake. Being\
  \ more-or-less a tree-covered mountain, Dominica has a unique climate and since\
  \ leaving town thirty minutes earlier, we had cooled as we climbed higher into the\
  \ cloud forest, to arrive at our destination shivering. The dub reggae that accompanied\
  \ us everywhere on our trip, fizzled to nothing on the stereo and we were enveloped\
  \ by a grey, misty silence, broken only by the occasional flap of birds wings. Whatever\
  \ few extra layers were pulled on as we jumped from the back of the truck, while\
  \ 2500 feet below, the island sizzled.\n\nHeading toward the lake, its deep darkness\
  \ was intimidating. A stiff breeze blew a current across the surface as I examined\
  \ the abundance of plant life thriving at the waters-edge, the likes of which I\
  \ had never seen before; prehistoric looking ferns, mosses and tiny coral-like flora\
  \ which looked like it would be equally happy on the lakebed. These, coupled with\
  \ the verdant mist-shrouded peaks that surrounded us, relics of a volcanic past,\
  \ gave the impression of a lost antediluvian world. We explored what we could of\
  \ the perimeter trail, as rain-laden clouds began to descend quickly, obscuring\
  \ our view of the wild and deserted landscape and we decided to move on to our next\
  \ destination.\n\nOnly a short downhill ride to meet the start of the Boeri Lake\
  \ trail, we turned off the empty track to be met by an odd sight; six adults, standing\
  \ still & silent, backs towards us at spaced intervals. \u201CWhat\u2019s going\
  \ on?\u201D I asked warily as we slowed, each of our party sizing up the scene,\
  \ when all but one of the group began to creep slowly forward. We realised we had\
  \ stumbled upon a game when one man leapt around suddenly, yelling \u201CRED LIGHT!\u201D\
  \ causing his friends to cry with laughter. We approached smiling, warmed by this\
  \ innocent spectacle, responding likewise to a cheerful \u201Cgood evening!\u201D\
  \ The group asked where we were going, warned us sternly against starting a trek\
  \ so late in the day and invited us to instead join them for some punch; we accepted\
  \ without persuasion. \n\nGathered around their car boot, chatting and sipping until\
  \ dusk, we felt welcomed and happy. The friends had driven into the mountains that\
  \ day to \u201Cjust enjoy life\u201D - a sentiment that they all seemed to take\
  \ seriously and as we said very fond farewells, the words on a business card pressed\
  \ into my hand said it all: \u201CJah Run Tings\u201D."
