Text: "Here\u2019s a story of myself taking a run-up both for my first travel experience\
  \ and for my life. \nDuring my high school studies, I won a six-month scholarship\
  \ to study in Argentina. When I received the envelope with my destination, it was\
  \ saying I was going to live in Neuquen. I checked on Google and I discovered that\
  \ it was a city in the middle of nothing, surrounded only by miles of land. That\
  \ was really odd to me, you know, in Italy every city is close to the other and\
  \ we don\u2019t have such extended spaces.\nAfter landing in this whole new country\
  \ without even knowing the language, I was told at the airport that the one that\
  \ was supposed to be my hosting family had some family problem and could not receive\
  \ me, I had been assigned to a new temporary family! I think that was one of the\
  \ hardest experiences I have dealt with in my life. I didn\u2019t even know their\
  \ name and how to communicate with them, I was only 17 years old and it was the\
  \ first time for me being alone on the other side of the world! I took a deep breath,\
  \ I decided to go on and not to tell my Italian family anything about it to not\
  \ get worried for my situation.\nI made my best to know my new family and to understand\
  \ their culture, it took a while but after a little I understood that they were\
  \ trying to do the same thing with me. My host sister began to stick small papers\
  \ with Spanish names on everything in the house so that I could learn their name\
  \ faster. After one month we started to get along quite well, unfortunately that\
  \ was exactly the time when I should have left them to join a new family for the\
  \ other five months. I was really concerned about moving to the new family when\
  \ I finally got some luck: a couple of days before leaving they told me that they\
  \ were really going on pretty well with me and if I wanted to, I could stay with\
  \ them for my whole experience in Argentina. I was so happy and I obviously took\
  \ that chance and had really great time with them. My amazing Argentinian host family\
  \ became soon my second family. \nI had the opportunity to travel a lot and to discover\
  \ those large spaces without any kind of human construction that are all over the\
  \ country. I was breathless, it was so strange to me, my eyes couldn\u2019t see\
  \ anything but nature and there was nothing between me and that beautiful landscape.\
  \  This country took a place in my heart and in my soul and awaked in me curiosity,\
  \ since then my hungry of travelling and discovering every country of this amazing\
  \ world has never stop growing."
