Text: "If Rajasthan can be counted on to have one thing, it\u2019s dust. Scooped up\
  \ from the surrounding desert and always seemingly in a rush to settle on your eyelashes,\
  \ the dust never seems to go away. Even late at night outside of this roadside restaurant,\
  \ the dust becomes mixed with the insect-repelling incense seeping out into the\
  \ night. The sad yellow lights seem to create tangible beams of matter, almost like\
  \ pillars of dust leading me to my dinner. \n\nMy driver, a dark skinned man wearing\
  \ battered sandals, switched off the car and left me sitting in the backseat to\
  \ join the other drivers in a roadside chai.\n\nStepping my foot out into the dust,\
  \ I immediately regretted wearing open sandals. The dust seemed to settle around\
  \ my toes and create a footprint in my sandal with every step. \nStretching and\
  \ slightly shivering from the desert cold, I begin the slow trek towards the roadside\
  \ restaurant to grab whatever I could off the menu that I hoped wouldn\u2019t make\
  \ me sick. \n\nAs I reached the outskirts of the dust beams, a small Indian Pariah\
  \ street dog limped across my path. It\u2019s back leg seems to hang low, barely\
  \ grazing the floor with each lurch and it\u2019s curled tail wagging happily in\
  \ the air. A usual sight in India and an ancestor of the dingo, I get the familiar\
  \ pain of guilt knowing that were I back home, this dog would have been scooped\
  \ up immediately by a passerby and given a good home. But in Rajasthan, this small,\
  \ ancient breed was just another feature of the landscape. Peppered around roads\
  \ and gutters. \n\nThe dog was slowly but confidently making its way towards a small\
  \ figure crouching on a nearby rock. The figure, a small man wrapped cloths stained\
  \ yellow and orange by the desert was coaxing the dog forward with a combination\
  \ of an outstretched hand holding a biscuit and a whistle. He wore a loosely bound\
  \ pagari, and in the soft light sprawling across the desert from the restaurant\
  \ he looked almost like a old tree stump.\n\nThe dg reached his outstretched hand\
  \ and eagerly began sniffing at the food on offer. The old man caught my eye waggled\
  \ his head with warmth as the dog gingerly began nibbling at the biscuit. \n\nThe\
  \ old man dropped what was left of the biscuits and dusted his hands off. The dog\
  \ sniffed the remnants in the dust and continued to eat. The old man gave a little\
  \ chuckle as he looked lovingly at his canine companion. \n\n\u201CThe dog only\
  \ likes to eat biscuits,\u201D he said in a thick accent. \u201CParle-G biscuits.\
  \ That\u2019s how you know he is truely Indian\u201D."
