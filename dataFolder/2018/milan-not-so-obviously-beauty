Text: "Milan is the economic and fashion capital of Italy, but it is also one of the\
  \ most underestimated destination of the country. This is because, unlike many other\
  \ places such as Rome or Venice, its beauties are less obvious.\nFor example, few\
  \ people visit the Basilica of Sant\u2019Ambrogio, one of the oldest cathedrals\
  \ of Milan, where you can admire a golden and precious stone covered altar dated\
  \ about 853 AD, or the unseen church Santa Maria at San Satiro, whose apse has been\
  \ painted with the illusion it\u2019s 9,70 meters deep, while it is 97 cm only!\
  \ \nAnd what about watching a movie over the roof of the Duomo surrounded by its\
  \ magnificent spires and a unique view of Milan? Talking about movies, in Milan\
  \ you don\u2019t have to decide whether to go first at the restaurant or at the\
  \ cinema: you can do both things at the Cinema Anteo. The theatre has seats and\
  \ tables and every day you can choose between the aperitivo show (6pm) or the dinner\
  \ one (8:30pm), and Saturdays and Sundays there is also a lunch show (1pm).\nSome\
  \ of the majestic buildings of the city are museums: four of them are part of a\
  \ circuit called \u201CMuseum houses\u201D, private houses of noble families which\
  \ contain private collections like the majestic clock collection of the Poldi Pezzoli\
  \ house, or the three hundred artworks held at the free-entrance Boschi-Di Stefano\
  \ Foundation. Not to mention the first private swimming pool of the country, nestled\
  \ in the huge park of the astonishing 1930\u2019s Villa Necchi Campiglio. \nTwo\
  \ steps away from Villa Necchi Campiglio, there\u2019s another special place. This\
  \ area, so close to the chaotic city centre and fashion district, is known as the\
  \ district of silence. Thanks to the positioning of the surrounding buildings, this\
  \ block is particularly quiet and hides an uncommon host: a flock of pink flamingos\
  \ which can be spotted from the grating of the private Villa Invernizzi.\nLast but\
  \ not least the love of Milan for its trams. To the locals trams are not just means\
  \ of transport. The ATMosfera (meaning atmosphere) is a restaurant-tram, a real\
  \ tram that brings you around the city while having dinner. It\u2019s so appreciated\
  \ you have to book weeks in advance. Another special tram is the one and only sauna-tram\
  \ in the world. A real old wooden tram wagon parked in the garden of the QC Milan\
  \ thermal baths that can reach 75\xB0C, hidden from the traffic and the eye by the\
  \ ruins of the roman walls that surrounded Milan. Definitely something that will\
  \ make you exclaim \u201Cthis is the last thing I expected\u201D!"
