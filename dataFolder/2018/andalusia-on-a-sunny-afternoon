Text: "Seville, what a great city, the smell of orange lingers like an expensive perfume.\
  \ Everywhere you\_ smell the sweet zest - which has lured many tourists to pick\
  \ a ripe fruit and taste the \u201Cdelicious\u2019\u2019 juices, all too often dropping\
  \ it as soon as their lips touched the flesh.\_These bitter fruits are for looks\
  \ only.\nAnother Sevillian scene, it is noon, you are sitting at a sticky table\
  \ in the sunshine on picturesque San Salvador Plaza. The waiter immediately asks\
  \ something in rapid Spanish directed at you, you just smile and say \u201CSi!\u201D\
  . A moment later two small beers arrive in front of you - embarrassing or happy\
  \ error?\_\nWhether it is eating beautiful yet bitter oranges or receiving accidental\
  \ beers for lunch, moments like these define our travels and are the spark to our\
  \ most cherished memories.\nOn my quest for more memories I decided to journey from\
  \ Seville to Cordoba, another Andalusian gem. Whilst enjoying the final rays of\
  \ sunshine outside Cordoba station an older gentleman with typical greyed beard,\
  \ friendly blue eyes, which sparkled with life, stopped me. He commented on the\
  \ scenic sunset photo I was taking, both of us marvelling at the beauty of the colours\
  \ and setting light. We soon discovered we were both enjoying a walk and did not\
  \ take long to decide to walk together.\_\nThe old man had lived in my home country,\
  \ Germany, in his youth, in the wild 70s, way before I was born. He saw me as an\
  \ opportunity to practise his rusty German, whilst I could improve on my broken\
  \ Spanish. We eagerly chatted often meeting in the middle of Spanish and German\
  \ or throwing in a curveball of English, to make each other understood. No matter\
  \ how broken the language, conversation flowed with life and philosophies. Although\
  \ my pronunciation of \u201Cpero\u201D particularly amused him, a hard German \u201C\
  rr\u201D rolling off my lips, untypical of the softer Spanish tones.\_\nAll we were,\
  \ two strangers escaping the solitude of a\_Sunday afternoon\_walk. Every so often\
  \ he would take me by the shoulder to stop and discuss a point in more detail. Mimicking\
  \ and gesturing loudly. I often found myself thinking about the importance of standing\
  \ still and truly listening to the other. How often do we feign interest by occasionally\
  \ \u201Cuhm-ing and yeah-ing\u201D\_nodding in consent when we only heard half of\
  \ the story. \nSadly this could not last forever. As I ran for my platform we hastily\
  \ blew Spanish kisses on each cheek and exchanged contact details. A warmhearted\
  \ goodbye to a brief happy encounter."
