Text: "9th of September2015, Wednesday \n\nGood morning love! I want to wake you up\
  \ with something fantastic and very special that happened to me today around 6:25-\
  \ 6:30 am.\nI woke up around 6:10 am and after wearing something (because I still\
  \ was in my pajamas), washing my teeth and doing my bed, I went out for my daily\
  \ morning walk.  The white flowers in the brahmasthan had bloomed again and I took\
  \ two of them, one of which I gave to the Iranian lady that I met at the stairs\
  \ close to the Saayut flower tree (unfortunately it doesn't have anymore flowers,\
  \ but it's growing some strange cone buds).  Then I started to walk again towards\
  \ the wooden beam but not with a special purpose in my head. When I reached there,\
  \ after saying hello to the guard  who takes care for the fallen leaves or trees\
  \ and flowers that grow in that area (in the Thai Sawadika), at the edge of the\
  \ road I stopped. I still was very sleepy. My eyes were half closed and kind of\
  \ covered with a light white curtain. However, in the long straight road I started\
  \ to distinguish something unusual. Somebody was coming, dressed up in a orange\
  \ color outfit. \n\nI rubbed my eyes. Maybe I was perceiving something wrong. It\
  \ couldn't be what my mind was telling me it was. Of course that the night's sleep\
  \ gave more credibility to the dreams than to reality. I decided to stay and watch\
  \ further. I was wondering who could this person be? I couldn't distinguish if it\
  \ was a male or a female. The person had worn a cloth rolling it around the body\
  \ like a saree but here it's not in the tradition of Thai people to wear such a\
  \ dress in a casual day and the way how the saree was draped did not belong to the\
  \ Thai tradition. Sarees are worn only by women and when the silhowette came closer\
  \ I noticed jaw openly that it was exactly what my \"everything can happen\" kind\
  \ of sleepy mind was thinking.\n\nI couldn't believe this. In a lost Thai village\
  \ in the middle of nowhere right to the jungle I was being witness of this awesome\
  \ almost non realistic scene."
