Text: "My experience traveling to Instabul ,Turkey was the most memorable experience\
  \ on a spiritul and political way. I originally visited Instabul because my friend\
  \ who lives there but she is from Washinton DC originally posted on FB she qas going\
  \ to leave Rurkey. There waa political unrest at the time and she was contemplating\
  \ her own safety in Turkey . At the ime the airport was bombed and refugees were\
  \ pouring in from Syria. I decided to book two tickets and visit the country that\
  \ I had only dreamed about. \n     We took KLM and had reservations at Takim Square\
  \ hotel which had a great del on Booked.com for 117 Euros for 4 days which seemed\
  \ a perfect amount to sty and see alll the attractions. We had a lay over in Germany\
  \ which is n international  hub for most other countries. When we got in I didnt\
  \ have a phone so we depended on seeing my friend therw at the airport. She was\
  \ waiting at the enterence and claimed she thought we were coming i  the day before.\n\
  \     We stayed at a hotel called Taksiim Square hotel which had another hotel connected\
  \ to the small one we were staying at. The stars were aligned for the man who owned\
  \ it upgraded our room because the tourism was at an ultime low in May. The gentleman\
  \ who owned thw hotel gave us the 200 square foot room which had the sorm look with\
  \ the smallest bathroom I have ever seen. We could out of a dirty window  down town\
  \ to a with large infrastructure of buildings covered on seagull dung and buildings\
  \ so old with laundry wires on top where people would be arranging their laundry\
  \ in terms of color. Rob and I my husband and I had been jet lagged and took a nap\
  \ and at 5pm this sound of a voice wailing was being channeled on the sky like a\
  \ hymn in Arabic. It was the call to prayer which happened 3 times a dy in case\
  \ you firget to pray at 5am in the morning. The hymn was beautiful and eerie in\
  \ a way that it permeated the city. We called our friend Ellie and looked forwars\
  \ to what my dream was to visit which was in our walking range the Hagia Sofia where\
  \ Constantinople moved Christianity flourish under a seccular regime. \n     The\
  \ Hagia Sofia was the most amazing museum I have ever been too. It represented the\
  \ east meets west and I was aurprised that it had two levels of church. It had been\
  \ descamated from the Moors and some if the Christian art was erased by Muslims\
  \ who covered the paintings of achetype paintings of Jesus and Mary with designs.\
  \ Muslims cannot paint pictures of people because its against their religion. Fascinating"
