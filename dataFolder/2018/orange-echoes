Text: "It all started with an orange cloth. This cloth was not meticulously woven\
  \ or stitched with silks and satin. It had tears and loose threads all faded from\
  \ the sunlight. She was told it's purpose and it's origin before given the time\
  \ to give it her own. \"Previously worn and blessed by a Buddhist monk\" they said.\
  \ She was handed a portion of the monk's robe, maybe 3 inches wide and just long\
  \ enough to wrap around the trunk of a fairly old tree. \"Pick any tree you'd like\"\
  \ they told her. \"Tie the cloth around it as it will act as a  symbol of protection\
  \ from future human destruction. Free to grow until nature takes it course.\" \n\
  \       She looked around for a moment, suddenly noticing each and every tree as\
  \ she stood in the midst of the forest. Some were already cut down, others burnt\
  \ and ridden with the stale smell of ash. The grip of her hand grew stronger around\
  \ the cloth as hope seemed to fail her. But there was life left too, a canvas of\
  \ greens and light reflecting off of tiny rain droplets in the creases of the leaves.\
  \ And that made her \nhappy. So with two bare feet, she journeyed into the robbed\
  \ forest to give back a tree its true purpose and protection. \n     It wasn't far\
  \ before she found it, you know 'the one' that tree that just stood taller than\
  \ all the rest. Yet she walked up to it hesitant as she realized that she would\
  \ be saving this single tree, none of the rest. Then that tree, the chosen one,\
  \ grew smaller in the reflection of her hazel eyes as all the others casted a hollow\
  \ shadow over the braids of her hair. A sensation of insignificance swallowed her.\
  \ The same insignificance she had been given as a child, a predisposition of what\
  \ things are supposed to be. \"Big is bigger than small, and small isn't really\
  \ anything at all\" these words punched her skull from society's arrogant past.\
  \ \"NO\" she screamed in the bitter silence. Echoes. Her presence echoed. Because\
  \ her purpose wasn't to be large, it was meant to be heard. Her purpose was to speak\
  \ for the ones who could not, and she realized this orange tethered cloth was more\
  \ than just a savior of a single tree. But rather a voice for all of the unspoken\
  \ living. \n     She walked out the forest that day, though she never really left.\
  \ A few rotations around the sun later, her embodiment returned. Despite every cloud\
  \ and shadow, she could still see that faded orange cloth through the forest made\
  \ of trees"
