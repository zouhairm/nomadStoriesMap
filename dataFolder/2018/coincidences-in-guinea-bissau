Text: "It was another hot day. By the smell of almost cooked rice coming from the\
  \ houses I knew it was around noon. While walking from one village to another to\
  \ interview a family about living inside a national park in Guinea-Bissau, I was\
  \ approached by a young tall Guinean woman who asked me if I could help her with\
  \ some money to go to Buba for a medical appointment. Inside the park only the shells\
  \ remain of medical infrastructure built and abandoned by NGOs. Buba, the closest\
  \ city outside the park, has the only medical center in the area. \n\u201CI am pregnant,\u201D\
  \ she said. At that time I could not tell if it was true or not.  \nThe park is\
  \ crossed by a large red sand road. I had travelled this road many times to go to\
  \ different villages. I saw people walking long distances carrying goods to sell\
  \ in the cities outside the park, small kids in damaged bikes who often lost their\
  \ floppy shoes because the distance to the pedals was too far for their small legs,\
  \ and a few motorbikes. People could also hitch a ride with a truck that crosses\
  \ the park once a day, but they have to walk until the red sand road. \nI took a\
  \ few seconds to decide. I had been advised to buy local products to give to people\
  \ as an appreciation for their collaboration, however, not money because it could\
  \ lead to the wrong message. \n\u201CYes, I will help you,\u201D I said. I remember\
  \ thinking \u201CI hope it\u2019s true.\u201D \nBack in Portugal I gathered some\
  \ clothes from friends and neighbours to offer to the local communities as an appreciation\
  \ for their time and meals spent with me. Every day, amongst other clothes, I always\
  \ carried two little identical striped dresses, one pink and one purple. They belonged\
  \ to twin sisters born in Guinea Bissau but living in Portugal whose adoptive mother\
  \ boosted my dream to go to Guinea Bissau. I did not wanted to separate these two\
  \ dresses. But on the last day of my fieldwork I still had them in my bag, so I\
  \ decided to give them even if it had to be separately. On this very same day I\
  \ went into a village and saw two lovely identical one year old twin sisters, one\
  \ a little bit shorter than the other. I approached them with a big smile on my\
  \ face and dressed them with the two little dresses. They fitted perfectly.\nAt\
  \ the same time a tall, smiling woman came out of the house saying \u201CThis is\
  \ the second time you are helping me, thank you.\u201D\n\u201CIs it?\u201D I reply.\n\
  \u201CYou helped me two years ago to go to Buba for my medical appointment,\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CThese girls are my children.\u201D"
