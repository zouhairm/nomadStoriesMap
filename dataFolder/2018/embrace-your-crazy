Text: "\u201CTake the reins!\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat!? Me?\u201D\n\nUnrelenting wind howling\
  \ wildly in my ears, heart pounding, the abandoned guide bar hangs terrifyingly\
  \ bare before me. Take hold, or the next gust of wind, we plummet. I\u2019m starting\
  \ to see a trend. I grab on and inadvertently dive us towards the treetops.\n\n\
  And that\u2019s when you catch your breath. The welcoming landscape reaching out\
  \ to you, reassuring you, like its people. Lush green hills spilling into white\
  \ sandy beaches, crystal clear water running from aqua through turquoise and teal;\
  \ there\u2019s a reason Abel Tasman National Park boasts a world-famous coast track.\
  \ Nature this excruciatingly beautiful is meant to be experienced, not Instagrammed.\
  \ Kiwis understand that. Pull out the kayak, hop aboard a catamaran, strap on your\
  \ trail boots and go, get your hands dirty, explore.\n\nThe barriers to entry are\
  \ low: jandals (flip-flops), kindness, and healthy curiosity will get you surprisingly\
  \ far. But you\u2019ll need to re-learn what\u2019s obvious here: relax, trust,\
  \ adapt.\n\nBlessed with vistas like this at every turn, you take heed when Jacob\
  \ from Cobb\u2019s Diner recommends a *particularly* breathtaking view. At Cape\
  \ Farewell, peering down steep cliffs at crashing waves, the lack of fenced-off\
  \ perimeter starts to feel natural. Freeing. Even the dual-lane, hairpin turns of\
  \ Crown Range Road don\u2019t phase you. You are James Bond. Wonder has replaced\
  \ fear.\n\nSitting atop a lawnmower strapped to a kite, sailboats the size of thumbtacks\
  \ below, I\u2019m starting to understand the nation\u2019s propensity towards self-effacement.\
  \ And its humour. How this book-reading, hot-cocoa drinking, home-body has now zip-lined\
  \ in complete darkness, been hurled out of a plane from 15,000 ft, sloshed inelegantly\
  \ down a hill via zorb ball, and risked mild hypothermia to see glow worms, escapes\
  \ me. Aotearoa, I have no idea how you\u2019ve brought this out in me.\n\nAnd...\
  \ Thank you.\n\nFlash of colour as a figure falls from the sky, in the distance,\
  \ screaming. Nick\u2019s crackled voice blares in through the headset: \u201CDon\u2019\
  t mind him, that\u2019s just Tom. He\u2019s a local.\u201D Oh, it registers. Those\
  \ were whoops of excitement, not screams of panic. Surplus of adrenaline? I\u2019\
  d have that too if I decided to skydive from a microlight. To think, I was worrying\
  \ about riding tandem in one and not falling out\u2026\n\nMy internal barometer\
  \ readjusts. For the hundredth time this week.\n\n\u201CSweet as.\u201D It feels\
  \ great."
