Text: "My expectations about my mission trip to Colombia were completely flipped in\
  \ the week that I was fortunate enough to spend in the South American country. I\
  \ was under the assumption that nobody would speak any English. I clearly would\
  \ have to revert to a primitive form of caveman communication based on grunting\
  \ and pointing. I expected the countryside to be sprawling with drugs and crime,\
  \ with the locals looking a lot like Danny Trejo (I did see a few episodes of Narcos\
  \ after all). We most certainly would be camping out in the jungle for a week, without\
  \ any modern necessities that I have come to enjoy as a spoiled American. Once there,\
  \ we of course would be treating the patients in makeshift tents since there was\
  \ no way the Colombians would have modern medical facilities. Very quickly I realized\
  \ how wrong I was.  Most of the people had a general semblance of English, with\
  \ all the doctors being fluent. I did not see any crime, and the only person that\
  \ looked like Danny Trejo was our bodyguard Carlos.  Our lodging was not a hut in\
  \ the jungle, but a very nice hotel complete with plenty of Colombian coffee. Finally,\
  \ we saw the patients in a gorgeous open-air hospital, with waterfalls, indigenous\
  \ birds, and every medical necessity I would have seen in Chicago. It took about\
  \ a day or so to reconcile what I had been trying to prepare for, and what reality\
  \ shook out to be. As humans, we try our best to prepare for situations that we\
  \ are thrown into. It\u2019s less mentally jarring when something new pops up and\
  \ you\u2019re ready to deal with the possibilities of that new situation.  Now one\
  \ expectation that I was completely certain of in Colombia was the sugar. I was\
  \ under the full assumption that the sugar industry there packages its sugar in\
  \ tiny knapsacks tied together with a string. Each individual knapsack with one\
  \ serving of sugar. What I disappointedly found out was that the sugar was packaged\
  \ in little plastic packets, not unlike sugar in America. I realized that I won't\
  \ always have my expectations met whether it be about different countries, hospitals,\
  \ or sugar packaging. What I do know is that even if your expectations are not met,\
  \ you can still learn about yourself, others, and the world if you are open to what\
  \ this planet can offer. I may not have my knapsack, but I do have some sugar I\
  \ smuggled back to Chicago. The day I find my tiny knapsack, that little package\
  \ of sugar is going in there, reminding me that only I control what my expectations\
  \ are."
