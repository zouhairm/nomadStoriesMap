Text: "As I clambered my way atop the massive bouldering hill, the vast expanse of\
  \ the hauntingly beautiful Kingdom Of Vijaya Nagara came into full view. Colossal\
  \ aggregations of boulders, towering like carefully balanced blocks of Jenga, were\
  \ scattered across the undulating terrain of the Deccan Plateau.\n\nRusty ochre\
  \ hues were interspersed with shades of jade green as clumps of coconut palms and\
  \ lush paddy fields encroached the landscape recklessly. River Tungabhadra cascaded\
  \ regally, separating the glorious city of Hampi from Virupapura Gadde \u2013A quaint\
  \ little village that had blissfully disconnected me from the rest of the world.\n\
  \nI perched on the edge of a granite boulder. The sun drowned against the backdrop\
  \ of strumming banjos, thrumming darbukas and voices of hippies chorusing in an\
  \ alien language.\n\n\u201CDidi! You want adhrak wali chai?\u201D A meek voice interrupted\
  \ the floating rhythm.\nI look around to see a tiny dark boy with spiky black hair\
  \ carrying a Thermos flask in one hand, and a stack of paper cups in another. He\
  \ cannot be more than eight years old.\n\n\u201CPlease Didi! Buy one cup!\u201D\n\
  Having lived my entire life in India, dirty kids tapping on tinted car windows clutching\
  \ their growling stomachs begging for money, adolescents selling Pani Puri at musty\
  \ corners of crowded streets, and children in rags selling selfie sticks and shades\
  \ at traffic signals is an everyday reality. Yet, I feel my stomach clench.\n\n\u201C\
  It be very taste! Please Didi!\u201D he pleads.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t you go to school?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CI go. I in third class. But I sell chai here in evenings.\u201D\nThere\
  \ is no remorse in his tone or sadness in his face. Just a pair of expectant eyes,\
  \ hoping I\u2019d buy his chai.\n\nOne more chai sold. Twenty more rupees. Perhaps\
  \ tonight he doesn\u2019t have to go to bed still hungry. Perhaps. \nI buy a cup\
  \ of ginger tea \u2013I hate milk.\n\nHe turns to leave -\u201COye! Want some candy?\u201D\
  \ I call.\nHis face breaks into a smile revealing his missing upper incisors, the\
  \ mention of candy lighting up his face.\n\nYes, the suffering in this world is\
  \ beyond my control and above my power, but I realize that the remedy doesn\u2019\
  t lie in the flick of a magic wand. Just like the large monolithic craton that metamorphosed\
  \ into the Deccan plateau, making way for civilization, making way for life; change\
  \ will come gradually, but steadily.\n\nSo we laugh, and eat gooey chocolate, licking\
  \ the wrapper clean as the sun disappears into horizon \u2013 I battle the world\
  \ just like how nature did- one breeze at a time, I do it one smile at a time."
