Text: "Embarking on a trip to South America after graduating felt like an opportunity\
  \ to not only visit the continent that had filled me with wonder but to taste life\
  \ with no constraints. My plan was that I had no plan, no route and no idea of the\
  \ challenges that lay ahead.  \n\nBy the time I reached Cusco I realised that I\
  \ would need to prepare for the sub-zero temperatures awaiting me in Chile or to\
  \ simply throw caution to the wind and change course. A strong instinct told me\
  \ Mexico was next, so I booked a one-way flight within the hour. I realized in this\
  \ moment there were no limitations to where I could end up - well maybe not the\
  \ St Regis in the Maldives. Within the next 3 weeks, I found myself in Asia. After\
  \ a few months of intense temple exploration, I was faced with a decision; to fly\
  \ from Thailand to Europe; or somewhere where I\u2019ve never thought to go before.\
  \ I went with the latter.\n\nI finally arrived in Kazakhstan, after a 19-hour soul\
  \ breaking layover in Novosibirsk airport with no food, no electrical socket and\
  \ no Wi-Fi (thankfully Nelson Mandela's 600-page autobiography kept me company).\
  \ After getting swindled by the taxi driver, I arrived at my hostel to a large group\
  \ of American military students, who were apparently studying Russian. At this moment\
  \ I knew I was in for an unusual experience. \n\nI spent a few days meandering through\
  \ the streets of Astana, taking in the ostentatious buildings and less than subtle\
  \ landmarks that pay homage to Star Wars. This wasn't as easy as it sounds since\
  \ it was -6, combined with intense Siberian winds and I had no jumper, coat or jeans.\
  \ I layered as many t-shirts as possible until I looked like a snowman. Soon enough\
  \ the bitter cold convinced me to get an overnight train to Almaty, crossing the\
  \ legendary Central Asian Steppe.  \n\nThe journey was seemingly perfect until the\
  \ conductor bribed his way into my cabin whilst I was asleep. I awoke in panic;\
  \ the truth is every woman faces terrifying moments in her life. Unfortunately,\
  \ this was one of mine. I used my instinct to escape unharmed but vowed to be more\
  \ vigilant. The next day turned things around. From getting stuck in deep snow whilst\
  \ trying to reach a mountain lake to having horsemeat with locals, my time in Almaty\
  \ was eventful.\n\nEvery moment of travelling Kazakhstan was unanticipated. I realised\
  \ having expectations when travelling is like wearing a blindfold. When I took it\
  \ off, I was surprised to find a country worthy of the mystique that surrounds."
