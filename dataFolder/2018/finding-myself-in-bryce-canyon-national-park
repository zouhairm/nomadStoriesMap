Text: "I have a penchant for nature and the outdoors, feeling the call of the wilderness\
  \ deep inside my bones. My bucket list of trails to traverse and mountains to climb\
  \ has been getting visibly longer as the years pass. One such adventure was hiking\
  \ the Mighty 5 National Parks in Utah. A lot of people were surprised when I said\
  \ that I really wanted to go to Utah, but one day I saw a commercial touting the\
  \ beauty and majesty of the Mighty 5 and I was instantly hooked. \n\nBut the last\
  \ thing I expected was how life changing this trip would be. \n\nAll the parks were\
  \ magnificent in their own right but Bryce stripped me bare. Bryce is the second\
  \ oldest National Park in Utah, after Zion, and the moment I stepped off the bus\
  \ at Bryce Point I knew I was in for something special. \n\nThe sun had yet to crest\
  \ over the peaks, and being at varying elevations between 6,600 to 9,100-feet the\
  \ cool air gave me goosebumps. I quickly pulled on my jacket before starting the\
  \ initial descent into the canyon.\n\nI had made it down several switchbacks before\
  \ the world opened up and subsequently swallowed me whole. That initial view of\
  \ the sun shimmering off the pink, yellow, cream and orange hoodoos brought tears\
  \ to my eyes and almost brought me to my knees. I had never in my entire life seen\
  \ anything so raw and unrelentingly beautiful, it absolutely took my breath away.\
  \ \n\nEvery step I took deeper into the amphitheater of hoodoos brought about a\
  \ surge of happiness as I became positively giddy from the immense beauty of it\
  \ all. The word Hoodoo is sometimes used to describe folk beliefs and practices.\
  \ The Spaniards believed that Native Americans worshiped these statue-like \u201C\
  enchanted rocks\u201D and I can understand why. If you looked at them long enough\
  \ you started to envision people dancing, huddling in a circle, or standing sentinel\
  \ over the land.\n\nWinding my way from the Peekaboo Trail to enter the ethereal\
  \ world of the Fairyland loop trail I felt like I had landed on Tatooine. With it\u2019\
  s layers of pink, cream and orange hues the rock beneath me and colored rocks around\
  \ me reminded me of candy corn. I felt like I was walking through a fairy tale.\
  \ \n\nHiking through this park brought about a shift inside, a deeper appreciation\
  \ for the hidden gems the world provides. It has sent me on a continuous hunt around\
  \ the world for more earth shattering views. A simple, yet majestic reminder of\
  \ what nature provides in a world that has stopped looking."
