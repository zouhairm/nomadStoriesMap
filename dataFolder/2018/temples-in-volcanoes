Text: "A soft smell of sulfur hit my nose like a veil from the earth core coming to\
  \ the ground as I climbed up the small mount of Zendan-e-Soleyman. The thick snow\
  \ surrounding the mountain and apparent absence of movement created a sense of profound\
  \ remoteness.\nI travelled in Iran for more than a year, but mainly to major towns,\
  \ and I had been fighting my hesitation to go to visit more remote places as there\
  \ are a few hindrances a foreign faces in Iran. However, many remarkable places\
  \ in Iran are off the beaten track. Takht-\xE9-Soleyman and Zendan-\xE9-Soleyman\
  \ are not just a group of remote ruins; their historical relevance stretches up\
  \ to our days and even touches major religions, Islam, Judaism and Christianity\
  \ alike. \nThere are many tales about this complex. Zendan-\xE9-Soleyman is believed\
  \ to be the place where King Solomon would trap evil spirits. A small volcanic conical\
  \ void core mount, it was crowned by a temple in pre-historical times circling the\
  \ 65-meter crater. The little volcano, still active, has the ruins of the Median\
  \ temple. The Medians professed a pre-Zoroastrian religion known as Mazdaism. With\
  \ the advent of Zarathustra, Mazdaism evolved to Zoroastrianism and determined the\
  \ construction of Takht-\xE9-Soleyman around the artesian lake 3 kms from Zendan-\xE9\
  -Soleyman. The artesian lake inside the fortification is traditionally believed\
  \ to be created by King Solomon. Around it, there are the remains of a large fortified\
  \ citadel which features the remains of a Zoroastrian temple that hosted 1 of the\
  \ 3 Royal Fires of the Sassanid.\n\u201CIt\u2019s believed that Solomon, Zarathustra\
  \ ans Jesus were here,\u201D my travel companion told me while strolling around\
  \ the citadel. \u201CIt\u2019s relevant to all religions and it marks the beginning\
  \ of the monotheist temples, all a replica of the original Zoroastrian temples\u201D\
  \ he added. \u201CVery few,\u201D he mentioned proudly \u201Care aware that all\
  \ three major religions nowadays had their origins in Iran. We are all Zoroastrians\
  \ in the end.\u201D\nThe sulfur we were breathing added a sense of urgency. The\
  \ magnificence of nature around the citadel made me think of the fragility of humanity\
  \ and its civilizations. It was the most remote place I had been to in Iran, and\
  \ made me think of all the beautiful places I could be missing. The snowy paths\
  \ had only our footsteps; we played like children in the snow, while listening to\
  \ the sound of the winds. The rays of sun faded and the sun set quite rapidly, leaving\
  \ the pond with a dark blue color."
