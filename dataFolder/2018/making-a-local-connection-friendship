Text: Each of us,down to the smallest tenants of Earth,needs communication.Communication
  occupies one of the most important places among human needs.At the same time, a
  person needs friendship.What is friendship?First of all,the word"friendship"has
  different meanings.First value:familiar.The majority of people,we consider to be
  friends are actually just our knowing,those whom we single out from the surrounding
  us faceless masses.We know their concerns,their problems,we consider them to be
  close people.There is no complete revelation,we don't trust them with our most secret
  desires.Gossip,envy,enmity is mixed with many connections of this type.Often behind
  outwardly cordial relations deep conflicts are hidden.Of course,this isn't outlier
  to us people,there is a certain closeness between us.But why call friendship so
  different in fact the types of relationships?The second is collective solidarity.In
  the latter case, friends are those who fight on our side,say,during the war.On the
  one hand,friends,on the other enemies.In this solidarity,there is nothing private.What,in
  this case,do we understand the word "friendship"?Intuitively,it evokes in us an
  idea of a feeling of deep,honest and frankness.Empirical research also shows that
  the vast majority of people just imagine friendship that way.For someone friendship
  its understanding,for others it's an ability to spend free time unforgettable.For
  me,friendship is above all,a sense of support for a loved one and a strong certainty
  that he or she will come to the rescue in a difficult moment.But friendship is not
  created so easily and simply.We choose our friends by the criteria that suit us.For
  someone makes friends is easy, for the rest, it is like a test by fire.I'll tell
  you honestly,I'm an introvert.It is difficult for me to make friends and support
  them for a long time.For people like me,I can share my 3 ways how to start dating:Firstly,friend
  should be willing to sacrifice his time,help.Try to treat attentively to others,rejoice
  at their successes.Secondly,develop to become a truly interesting person.Be optimistic
  person,smile more often-all this will attract people to you.Thirdly,find the points
  of contact with the person you want to be friends.The basis of a strong friendship
  is a common interest.To sum up,I want to say that everyone can make friends if he
  or she wants.In friendship two people equally should cherish their relations,protect
  them.And then,in my opinion the friendship will be really strong and solid
