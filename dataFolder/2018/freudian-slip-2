Text: "It was a balmy Saturday morning and I was abruptly awoken by my IPhone alarm.\
  \ Too early, even for the roosters on the cherry farm I was visiting in eastern\
  \ Portugal. Despite the serene location and breathtaking landscapes, I was there\
  \ to help a friend harvest the cherry crop to sell. As we drove up the winding roads\
  \ to the local farmers' market, I got nauseous. Not from carsickness, but from nervousness.\
  \ I did not speak the language, yet I was posing as a local. Selling fruitful goodness\
  \ to the masses.\n\nFor two days we plucked perfectly plump cherries off the tree.\
  \ So ripe, they fell into your hands. They were the most beautiful shades of red-\
  \ dark to bright. Something I had only ever seen in a stock photo. The taste was\
  \ even better- sweet and juicy. I was confident that our cherries would be a hit,\
  \ considering I addictively consumed copious amounts myself. I was just concerned\
  \ customers would be turned off by an outsider trying to peddle goods, on their\
  \ turf.\n\nIn the town square, we set up our booth amongst other crafts, baked goods\
  \ and fresh produce. We carefully placed our products to attract customers. My friend\
  \ gave me a couple phrases, but insisted our large sign and obvious bright red cherries\
  \ or \"cerejas\" is explanatory enough. The morning had slow foot traffic. The town\
  \ elders eagerly sized up the array of vendors and swarmed their best goods. They\
  \ meticulously searched everything before they made their choice. At lunch, the\
  \ families arrived and would quickly choose. Just a snack for restless children,\
  \ before heading to the nearby stage to enjoy the singers and dance troupes.\n\n\
  We were almost sold out by late afternoon. I was a getting anxious to finish up.\
  \ It had been a long day of standing and engaging. It was a fun atmosphere and I\
  \ wanted to unwind as a local. I reflected that in my sales pitch. \u201CCervejas.\
  \ Cinco mas!\u201D People came over in a hurry. I also noticed a couple faces of\
  \ disappointment. \n\nAfter the last cup was sold and car packed up, we decided\
  \ to enjoy the last hour of the festivities. I was pleased with myself. I lived\
  \ a life that wasn\u2019t my own, as a Portuguese cherry farmer. Just then, one\
  \ of the locals came over with a beer and invited me to join. \n\nHe quipped, \u201C\
  You were shouting beer all afternoon. You deserve one now.\" \n\nEvidently, due\
  \ to my exhaustion or excitement, I started shouting \u201Ccerveja\u201D which is\
  \ beer. Cherries are \u201Ccerejas.\u201D However, on a beautiful afternoon like\
  \ that, both cherries and beer would have hit the spot."
