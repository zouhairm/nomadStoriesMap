Text: "Walking, or I should say wandering, for what feels like hours through the different\
  \ terminals of the cold airport in Amsterdam. Every once in a while, I look up because\
  \ of the familiar sound. The sound of a language which I recognise. It\u2019s my\
  \ own, but somehow, I still seem surprised by its frequent use. It doesn\u2019t\
  \ seem normal anymore. So, I just keep wandering, through the cold industrial corridors\
  \ of the airport. It\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock in the morning and I feel detached. I\
  \ know around a few more corners there are people I love dearly waiting for me.\
  \ I should quicken my step, but instead I hesitantly linger. I don\u2019t really\
  \ feel excited, I guess I feel numb. This is it, this is the end of the adventure\
  \ I was longing for- but also hesitant, excited and scared for at the same time.\
  \ Not that many months had passed since I was at this same airport, filled with\
  \ adrenaline, about to embark on an adventure I would never have expected.\n\nIt\
  \ had taken me only a month and at the same time years to prepare for this journey.\
  \ Within a month I decided to take the plunge, book the flight ticket and go to\
  \ the other side of the world, which had always felt like an unreachable goal. Simultaneously,\
  \ for years I had dreamt about traveling to New Zealand. Although I had been wanting\
  \ to travel for years, there had always been something holding me back. The weeks\
  \ before I left I realised that fear was probably the most important component which\
  \ had kept me from traveling on my own. Fear of fears. \n\nNonetheless, the feeling\
  \ of complete freedom hit me immediately when I was waiting for the passport control.\
  \ The thrill and excitement were accompanied by my heart racing exponentially. I\
  \ embarked on a rollercoaster ride of uninterrupted unexpected experiences. This\
  \ ride and the feeling of complete freedom that came along with it was the last\
  \ thing I expected. During my travels the fears I had before entering the backpacker\
  \ life didn\u2019t come true. Where I had feared to be overwhelmed by the continuity\
  \ of changing environments, I had realised the circumstances of the life I was living\
  \ offered a beforehand unimaginable freedom. \n\nBut, the cold in the industrial\
  \ airport corridors emphasise the reality I am in. I can no longer imagine being\
  \ able to enjoy the freedom the past months offered me, if I close my eyes. Because\
  \ there it is again, that strange familiar sound."
