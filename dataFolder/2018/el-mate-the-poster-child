Text: "Coming to Buenos Aires, I noticed that most people here are sun people.  When\
  \ a sunny day appears everyone is outside playing football (soccer for those North\
  \ American people who just have to be different), sun bathing, talking to friends,\
  \ and sipping mate.  Mate, the traditional herb drink, is a central marker in Argentinean\
  \ lifestyle.  I remember one day I went to the Reserve with my Spanish teacher and\
  \ all her alumni and when I looked around not one group of people was without their\
  \ thermoses of hot water and their mate in the traditional pumpkin or wooden gourds,\
  \ sipping away on a hot, sunny day, relaxing and chatting with friends as they shared\
  \ this communal drink. There were literally over 50 people sitting in the small\
  \ green patch and at least over 100 passing by; not one without their mate minus\
  \ the runners and bike riders.\n There is nothing like a well prepared mate.  Of\
  \ course, there are many different types of mates and different ways to prepare\
  \ it.  There are whole books dedicated to this discussion.  El Mate is the poster\
  \ child of Argentina, if not of South America.  I remember as I went through customs\
  \ in Uruguay, the Uruguayan customs man was making fun of Luli, my Argentinian friend,\
  \ because of the way she prepared her mate.  He remarked that he could tell she\
  \ was Argentinean because of the gourd she had her mate in.  It was very untraditional,\
  \ but in her defense, we were traveling and had to make due with her neon green\
  \ plastic mate cup so she wouldn\u2019t damage her others.  There is no where you\
  \ can go within Argentina without someone carrying their gourd and a thermos.  El\
  \ Mate and the Sun: two important symbols of Argentina.  \n  One day, I went to\
  \ the park and read in the shade of a tree.  When I looked up I noticed that everyone\
  \ was in their shorts or bikinis sunbathing, sipping mate.  No wonder they have\
  \ the sun on their flag.  These sun people can\u2019t get enough, although the cities\
  \ weather is so temperamental and we\u2019ve had an equal amount of rain as sun\
  \ during the year, you could almost say they were hinchas por el sol (sun fanatics).\
  \  I could almost see them routing for the sun as they do for their football teams.\
  \ I have to admit I felt out-of-place as I sat in the shade of a tree in black pants\
  \ and a black shirt, without sun and without mate.  I took a deep breath and reminded\
  \ myself that I am not Argentinean therefore; I didn\u2019t need to be a sun person."
