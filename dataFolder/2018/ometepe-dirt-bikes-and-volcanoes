Text: "Nicaragua is a favorite for travelers visiting Central America. Go exploring\
  \ in colonial towns such as Leon and Granada, go \u201Cash boarding\u201D down the\
  \ side of a live volcano, or tour the hundreds of islands that make up Granada.\
  \ In Nicaragua, you can still travel under the radar and have great experiences.\
  \ Part of my trip consisted of visiting the island of Ometepe. Ometepe is quite\
  \ an amazing island in the middle of Nicaragua lake and it's a great place for the\
  \ adventuress soul. Ometepe is made up of two volcanoes, Concepci\xF3n and Maderas,\
  \ around which everything revolves. Volc\xE1n Concepti\xF3n, which is still active,\
  \ is the monster of the two and is located on the north side of the island, close\
  \ to the main docking point of Moyogalpa. Adventure seekers from all over the world\
  \ travel to Ometepe Island just to climb Volc\xE1n Concepci\xF3n. The day finally\
  \ came for us. We were finally going to hike Volc\xE1n Concepti\xF3n. Our alarms\
  \ buzzed violently at 5:30am and we rolled out of bed with just enough time to throw\
  \ together the day\u2019s necessities\u2013snacks, 2 liters of water for each of\
  \ us, our phones for pictures, and sweaters in case of weather changes during our\
  \ hike. Throughout the 8 hour climb, our guide demonstrated his uncanny ability\
  \ to spot wildlife and fascinating plants that we would have never have noticed\
  \ on our own. We saw a lot of monkeys, and they became very active when they spotted\
  \ us. The climb half way up was lush, which was very beautiful to see. After we\
  \ past the mid-way point, the real challenge began. It became very windy, and we\
  \ were suddenly in the clouds. All the sudden there were no more trails, just rocks\
  \ and gravel. We were actually climbing up the side of a volcano; grabbing rocks\
  \ with our hands and using our walking sticks to pull ourselves up. My head started\
  \ to play games with me, but I shook it off and kept on going. We conquered the\
  \ volcano! Tired from the uphill climb, our descent was taken fairly slowly. My\
  \ legs wouldn't hold my body up anymore and I kept falling down on the slippery\
  \ rocks. The three of us ended the hike covered in dirt and clay and a few bruises\
  \ from some slips and tumbles. Thinking back to that day, I cannot believe I did\
  \ that. I cannot believe I climbed up a very steep volcano and risked my life. I\
  \ will never forget how hard that climb was. These are memories that you can't buy,\
  \ these are the memories that will last with you forever. Life is an adventure,\
  \ go out there and explore it."
