Text: "When we first left for our trip to Iceland, we really didn't know what to expect.\
  \ If you ask someone, anyone in fact, what they think about Iceland, they will tell\
  \ you that it is the most beautiful country in the world and that they absolutely\
  \ want to go there sometimes. I felt so lucky to leave and I couldn't wait to start\
  \ the journey. At our arrival to Keflavik International Airport we could immediately\
  \ see how much that land is different from ours (Italy), but we still had no clue\
  \ on what to expect. We spent the first day and a half in Reykjav\xECk, the capital,\
  \ wondering through lovely little and colorful houses and really expensive coffee\
  \ shops. I have to be honest by saying that cities (if we can call them that) are\
  \ note very interesting: lovely sure, but you don't have much to see after one day.\
  \ The real journey started when we left Reykjav\xECk and headed to the Eastern coast\
  \ through the only asphalted road of the island, the Hringvegur. First thing the\
  \ next morningwe left to see Seljalandsfoss and Svartifoss, two of the most amazing\
  \ waterfalls I have ever seen ( though Iceland is full of amazing waterfalls ).\
  \ Sure, they are amazing; but the thing I appreciated the most and didn't expect\
  \ at all, which started to change my vision of things, was traveling to get there:\
  \ only us in the middle of infinite nature, no one else on the horizon, only few\
  \ traces of humankind and freedom, freedom everywhere. We started to see, to experience\
  \ the greatness of the pure and untouched nature; the freedom from the stress of\
  \ everyday routine, the sense of being one with the land. That feeling kept growing\
  \ during our long movements through the Hringvegur and the many dirt roads of the\
  \ Highlands, and reached the highest point when we explored Jokuls\xE0rlon and the\
  \ Diamnond Beach. Not only a phenomenon unique in his kind, but a place that shows\
  \ the greatness, the mightiness and the huge power of nature itself. It gave us\
  \ a real sense of connection with earth and all the natural elemnets, the feeling\
  \ that modern life hasn't corrupt everything yet, that you can still be free from\
  \ the frustrations and futile concerns of our daily life; that in fact you are so\
  \ little and you don't have to feel that importante at all, you don't have to carry\
  \ all that weights on your shoulders, but just live. When I was there I didn't realize\
  \ all this at first, but on my way back I started to miss all that feelings and\
  \ sensations. The last thing I expected was to experience that freedom."
