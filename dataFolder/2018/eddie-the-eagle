Text: "He stood from where he had been laying, belly down in the stream. He didn\u2019\
  t look any different sopping wet than he had before; maybe his black athletic pants\
  \ were clinging a bit more around his ankles, but we had all been sweating so much\
  \ on our hike in the 80% humidity that there was little perceptible difference.\
  \ Droplets still dripped down his face, but this time it was river water escaping\
  \ from his dark, wet hair rather than the sweat on his forehead, their path diverted\
  \ by the huge grin on his face. His arms shot up in the air, leaving spray in their\
  \ path that- just for an instant \u2013 gave him wings that made him look like the\
  \ nickname we\u2019d given him: Eddie the Eagle. \u201CI FEEEEL good\u201D he exclaimed,\
  \ his upraised fists dropping to point to all of us still taking our packs off on\
  \ the riverbank, inviting the chorus of \u201Cdun na na na na na na\u201D that followed.\n\
  I had decided against going to Taman Negara, the 130 million year old rainforest\
  \ in peninsular Malaysia, because I was afraid. I\u2019ve scared away plenty of\
  \ black bears, given many a rattlesnake a wide berth, and dug countless ticks \u2013\
  \ and similar looking flecks of dirt \u2013 from my flesh over the years. But tigers,\
  \ elephants, and pythons were a different story. The peace that washed over me upon\
  \ deciding not to go was brief, soon replaced by a flood of regret at being in one\
  \ of the most biodiverse countries in the world and NOT visiting the jungle. It\
  \ was in that moment I decided to go; when my regret over something not done outweighed\
  \ all my other fears combined.\nI had been invited to join an international school\
  \ group\u2019s backpacking trip, and Eddie was the guide. He had spent the majority\
  \ of his career on a disaster relief team, and his usually playful eyes fell to\
  \ the ground as he told us of how much death he\u2019d witnessed. That\u2019s why\
  \ he\u2019d come \u201Chome to the jungle\u201D, and it truly was his home. Even\
  \ more than the house with a wife and five young daughters in town, he said he belonged\
  \ here. He smiled at the memory as he told us about sleeping in the river, his head\
  \ on a vine - \u201Cnot a snake!\u201D he warned - to mask his scent from animals\
  \ hunting him during his wilderness survival training. And of the baby panther he\u2019\
  d nursed back to health, recognizable still in the wild by the green paint his uncle\
  \ had spilled on it\u2019s left ear.\nAs he stood in the stream, fish splashed near\
  \ his hand that held the bread the porcupine had left after chewing through his\
  \ bag the night before. \u201CFeeding my friends\u201D, he said. No, his family."
