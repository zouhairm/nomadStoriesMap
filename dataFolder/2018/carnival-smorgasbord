Text: "We spent all day in a 200-square foot apartment. \n\nThere's a window, but\
  \ all we can see is a cement wall. As I cross things off my to do list my eyes start\
  \ to glaze over. Around 5 p.m. I slam my computer shut and suggest a stroll to the\
  \ nearest bar. We need to stretch our legs and see daylight before it's gone.\n\n\
  Every time we've passed this restaurant there has been live music pouring from the\
  \ entrance. Today is no different. In fact, it seems even louder than before. \n\
  \nWe enter and grab a table toward the back. It is larger than it looks from the\
  \ outside. We are the only gringos here. \n\nA man brings us a menu. He has paint\
  \ on his face. We take a closer look around. There are green, sequined hats, blue,\
  \ metallic wigs, and bright tops in every color of the rainbow. A sign above the\
  \ stage tells us that we're celebrating Carnival.\n\nThe man returns. Silas wants\
  \ a gin and tonic. I order a Smirnoff. He explains that the Smirnoff is two for\
  \ one. Okay, no problema - two Smirnoffs and the gin. \n\nHe seems confused and\
  \ tries again. Smirnoffs are THREE for the price of TWO.\n\nFine. Three Smirnoffs\
  \ then. My Spanish is worse than I thought. \n\nWe breathe a sigh of relief. Neither\
  \ of us are sure what he'll bring back from the bar. The man returns with a shot\
  \ of gin, three shots of vodka, and some tonic.\n\nThis is not what I expected.\
  \ I anticipated one of those fun, fruity bottled drinks. I'm embarrassed. I remember\
  \ now that Smirnoff is a brand of vodka too.\n\nNo worries, I'm flexible.\n\nWe\
  \ settle into our drinks and sway to the music. The band is extraordinary. \n\n\
  An audience member takes the stage to sing. Even she has an amazing voice! A young\
  \ man brings us an assortment of plates: chips, bread, pico de gallo, spaghetti,\
  \ potatoes, and hot dogs.\n\nThis surprises us.  \n\nDid we order food? How much\
  \ will it cost? Is this a typical Mexican Carnival menu? \n\nBefore long the young\
  \ man returns with more food - this time tamales.\n\nWe eat up. We're laughing now.\
  \ I guess we don't need to cook when we get back to the apartment. Silas wonders\
  \ aloud if we have enough pesos to cover the meal. \n\nWe sip our drinks and dance\
  \ some more. The young man reappears, with nuts and a lime wedge.\n\nAs our vodka\
  \ disappears, I ask the man for our check. I don't know what to expect. \n\nIt reads\
  \ 162 pesos, not even ten dollars. They only charged us for the three shots!\n\n\
  My Spanish isn't good enough to ask why all to food is free, so I leave a generous\
  \ tip and hope no one chases us down the street."
