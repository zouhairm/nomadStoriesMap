Text: "My entry permit was ready and it was time to visit the home of the woman I\
  \ loved. Her descriptions of her city were so detailed that I was confident in finding\
  \ her house without the help of Google Maps. On a cold wet winter's day, crossing\
  \ the Enguri Bridge, I made my way across the border, with the blessing of the Russian\
  \ military.\n\nThere was just one problem: I was alone. My girlfriend wasn't waiting\
  \ for me and neither was her family. No one had been home for twenty-five years.\
  \ \n\nI arrived in Sukhum, the capital of a land haunted by the horrors of a war\
  \ that resulted in the ethnic cleansing of a quarter-million Georgians. Normally,\
  \ on a trip like this, I\u2019d be running on an adrenaline high; here I was overcome\
  \ with melancholy. In my girlfriend\u2019s homeland without her, I had entered Abkhazia\
  \ on her father\u2019s birthday, and she had asked me not to send her any photos.\
  \ A Russian sniper had taken his life, and with it the life she might have had;\
  \ raised on stories and thoughts about what could have been, her identity had come\
  \ to be defined by a forbidden home. \n\nBarred from ever returning by a series\
  \ of rigorous security screenings and the danger of retribution, her response to\
  \ the photos I would eventually send her was heart-breaking. Despite being too young\
  \ to even remember the days of yesteryear, she responded with a single word: home.\
  \ I\u2019d never associated with the traditional concept of home; for me, it has\
  \ always been wherever I happen to be living, not somewhere I long to return to.\
  \ Yet, I was broken by my inability to bring her home and perhaps offer her some\
  \ kind of closure. As a traveller, you rely on locals to guide you through foreign\
  \ lands; she had to settle for a vicarious experience of her homeland through me,\
  \ a foreigner who, until recently, couldn\u2019t find it on a map.\n\nCrossing back\
  \ into Georgia-proper, the anguish and longing of an entire nation was heavy on\
  \ my shoulders. I never did find her house, even Google Maps unable to help me navigate\
  \ the remains of a place whose entire soul had been destroyed. I had just entered\
  \ a land wet with the blood of genocide, free to return as many times as I liked,\
  \ thanks to my EU passport. Meanwhile, the woman I loved and a million others remain\
  \ unable to cross that bridge, left with dreams of what might have been, memories\
  \ of their homeland slowly succumbing to time, chasing a past that year by year\
  \ recedes before them."
