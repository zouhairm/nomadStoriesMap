Text: "Sebastiana asked me when I would next leave for Panajachel. When I asked why,\
  \ she replied \u201CWe will dress you in Marque\xF1a traje so that everyone knows\
  \ where you are from!\u201D \nI had secretly hoped I'd get a chance to wear the\
  \ Mayan traje since first arriving in San Marcos, six weeks ago. The clothing that\
  \ the women wore was breathtaking. Each town has its own specific design. In this\
  \ way, a woman can wear her traje anywhere else in Guatemala and everyone will know\
  \ where she is from. In San Marcos the traje included a navy, striped corte with\
  \ a scarlet patterned belt and a dark red, huipil embroidered with flowers. \nOn\
  \ the day in which I was to leave for Panajachel, Sebastiana was ready for me as\
  \ soon as I stepped out of the shower. I was attacked by her and three other cackling\
  \ women who entered my room, stripped me down and started fussing with the mess\
  \ of clothing they had brought to stage me in. It took nearly ten minutes of poking\
  \ and prodding to get me dressed to their liking. They were laughing the whole time--\
  \ and I\u2019m talking unrestrained, side-splitting laughter. \nSandra braided my\
  \ hair as the others chatted animatedly in colloquial Kaqchikel. I pushed back the\
  \ horribly uncomfortable suspicion in my gut that they were judging me. When they\
  \ finished, the women examined me from head to toe like a hunk of meat in the marketplace\
  \ and then asked me whether I had a boyfriend. \nI replied that no, I did not. Sebastiana\
  \ smiled and said \u201CWell, now that you are \u2018guapa\u2019 you can meet someone\
  \ in Panajachel.\" I laughed uncomfortably at that.\nI didn\u2019t know if I should\
  \ take that to mean that I was unattractive before, or if they were just accustomed\
  \ to seeing me in clothes they considered suitable for an effeminate man. \nI didn\u2019\
  t exactly feel beautiful. Walking down the path to la launcha set for Panajachel,\
  \ every Marque\xF1o would snicker at the sight of me\u2014 that is, if they didn\u2019\
  t point outright and cackle with mirth. The corte was constricting and I had to\
  \ waddle, taking tiny steps to traverse slowly to the lake.  When I picture beauty\
  \ and grace, a penguin is not generally the first thing that comes to mind.  \n\
  When I arrived in Panajachel, I finally had the opportunity to look in a mirror.\
  \ My feelings of low self esteem were immediately erased. I looked beautiful. The\
  \ clothing, though stiff, fit well. Sandra\u2019s work on my hair was gorgeous.\
  \ I felt like a Marque\xF1a\u2026 and proud! I penguin-waddled the rest of the day\
  \ with a new found boldness, and a skip in my tiny step."
