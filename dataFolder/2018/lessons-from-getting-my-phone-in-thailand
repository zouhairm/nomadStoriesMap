Text: "My trip to Thailand was one of the best experiences of my life- It was my first\
  \ time traveling internationally. It was a bit of a culture-shock once we landed,\
  \ but I learned more about myself and the world out there that I had yet to experience.\
  \ While I had the best time in Thailand, on my first full day in Bangkok, I was\
  \ the victim of pickpocketing. Not even realizing the \u201CBeware of pickpocketing\u201D\
  \ signs around the temple- of course-until after I fell victim 5 minutes after arriving.\n\
  \nI have come up with a list of some Do\u2019s and Dont\u2019s for traveling abroad\
  \ with links to handy items below:\n\nDo yourself a favor and DON\u2019T bring a\
  \ backpack to use as your daily bag. I bought a Longchamp \u2018Le Pliage\u2019\
  \ Backpack specifically for this trip, thinking it would be the easiest way to travel\
  \ so my hands would be free. I loved that it had a zip top and flap to cover- figuring\
  \ this made it extra safe, but it didn\u2019t, and my new iPhone was stolen. After\
  \ reading tons of articles, the best choice would be a crossbody or messenger-type\
  \ bag. I always bring my Canon DSLR and GoPro with me on trips, so I like a roomier\
  \ bag.  With these bags, you can zip them up and keep them in front of you, making\
  \ travel a bit safer.\nDO write down the names, addresses, and phone numbers for\
  \ the places you are going to visit! Do not soley rely on technology, because we\
  \ all know things happen. The person in our that had the hotel address kept it in\
  \ his email and once we reached the town, his phone didn\u2019t work and we spent\
  \ the next two hours walking around town trying to find the hotel- not the best\
  \ situation.\nDON\u2019T over-pack. I was in Thailand for 12 days and I fit everything\
  \ in one carry-on and purse, but it was still too much! I\u2019ve been spoiled by\
  \ being able to stuff an insane amount of stuff in my carry-on knowing, as long\
  \ as it fit in the overhead, I was good! Imagine my shock when learning, first-hand,\
  \ that most international carry-on items are subject to size AND weight limitations\
  \ when I arrived to check into my flight. I bet you can guess how my experience\
  \ went. I was forced to check-in my bag and pay ridiculous checked baggage fees.\
  \ Save yourself the trouble and pack smart. It\u2019s also a good idea to invest\
  \ in a handheld scale to be certain you\u2019re good to go.\nDO have fun. Remember\
  \ to enjoy your time on your adventure. Go with the flow, roll with the punches,\
  \ and fully embrace the surroundings and cultures. Appreciate your opportunity to\
  \ see a world different from your day-to-day life!"
