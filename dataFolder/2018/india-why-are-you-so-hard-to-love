Text: "Deciding to travel is one thing. But to do it by yourself is a completely different\
  \ ball game. To disconnect yourself from the comforts of life back home is easy,\
  \ but to be truly independent in unknown territory is another. I literally plunged\
  \ myself into the deep-end when I embarked on a solo trip to India in May 2017;\
  \ an exhausting, yet invaluable experience. They were so many elements to take in;\
  \ the heat, the day-to-day commutes, the hassling and the hustle and bustle of India.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI want to go to Victoria Terminus!\u201D I plead with my illiterate\
  \ rickshaw driver as I point to it on a map on my phone. A dizzying 30-minute journey\
  \ and 500 rupees later I was lost in the streets of Bandur, the party region of\
  \ Mumbai, trapped amongst the thousands of people, trying to carve my way through\
  \ the traffic.\n\nWithin hours of landing in Mumbai,  this crazy, mosh-pit metropolis\
  \ of a city had sucked me in, chewed me up and spat me back out within minutes.\n\
  My first day in India had given me a taste of the things that would become very\
  \ familiar to me; frustration, nausea, tiredness. \n\nIt is the sheer unexpectedness\
  \ of India that seemed to catch me off guard; like the trespassing cow standing\
  \ outside my bedroom door in my Hampi guesthouse and gate-crashing a wedding in\
  \ Pushkar. Not even my recent travels could prepare me for the next month I was\
  \ about to endure.\n\nIt\u2019s the constant human interaction that\u2019s the biggest\
  \ culture shock; thousands of selfies with locals, constant haggling of prices with\
  \ shop-clerks and rickshaw drivers and random people who want to know everything\
  \ about me, only to discard me once they know I\u2019m not buying what they are\
  \ selling. Personal space does not exist, and that eroded my patience.\n\nI remember\
  \ sitting on one of the many Ghats on the Ganga in Varanasi, to my left people are\
  \ burning their deceased, while the cows and dogs watch on and the children play\
  \ in the river. I was in sheer awe.\n\nI left Delhi exhausted, irritated and struggling\
  \ to figure why this country was so hard to love. \n\nOnly when I was truly outside\
  \ my comfort zone, did I feel as close to the edge as I did. I wanted to be challenged\
  \ and India succeeded. But the beautiful thing about it? Hindsight. Only now when\
  \ I look back do I truly appreciate the people I met, the places I visited, the\
  \ cultures I immersed myself in and even the long sleepless nights on trains and\
  \ buses. \n\nI was given a harsh lesson. But do I plan to stop? I'm just getting\
  \ started."
