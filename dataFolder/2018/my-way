Text: "The last thing I expected was to be standing in this square, in the same spot\
  \ as the millions of pilgrims that came before me.\n\nThe cathedral\u2019s crumbling\
  \ facade is covered in scaffolding which, through the sweat in my eyes, could be\
  \ its exposed skeleton. The blue sheeting that flaps in the breeze against these\
  \ rusted bones is the colour of my filthy pack. The bag was a lighter hue once,\
  \ before being blessed by six weeks of dirt, during the walk from St Jean.\n \n\
  Because the building\u2019s grandeur is partly hidden, I turn around to watch my\
  \ fellow pilgrims make the final steps of their journeys. \n\nAn elderly man with\
  \ a determined gait marches into the square. When he stops in the middle, he has\
  \ such a look of surprise on his face, it\u2019s as if he put on his boots one day\
  \ and started walking, never expecting his feet to lead him here.\nA pair of walkers\u2014\
  Italian flags fastened proudly to their packs\u2014sink to their knees. Tears mingle\
  \ with sunscreen before finding the ground.\nA young peregrina, eyes squeezed shut,\
  \ throws her head back and whoops into the sky. \nPilgrims just meeting for the\
  \ first time, embrace each other like old friends, ignoring the smell of the hard-earned\
  \ sweat that wafts off their bodies. \nPeople snap selfies. They cry. They shake\
  \ hands. They gather in smiling groups and pose, dented hiking poles raised to the\
  \ sky.   \n\nBut the ones I notice the most are those that hobble across that imaginary\
  \ finish line, their bodies only just being held together with plaster, Ibruprofen\
  \ and hope.\nI notice them because their story is mine. \nEvery morning on the Camino,\
  \ I would lace up my boots, curse under my breath and walk out the door of the previous\
  \ night\u2019s albergue. Five kilometres down the road, I would have to sit on the\
  \ side of the path, remove my boots and massage my aching feet, while I endured\
  \ the embarrassment of watching pilgrims thirty years my senior overtake me. \n\
  By midday the pain would have seeped from my body, via my head, into my heart. Every\
  \ day would be the day I gave up. Until a message would come back from my heart\
  \ to my weary body, via my head: KEEP GOING\u2014in an endless loop.\nSometimes\
  \ I would cry on creaky wooden pews in dank churches lit only by candles. Other\
  \ times I raged to the sky on stretches of road when I thought I was alone. \n\n\
  I don\u2019t really know what kept me going. \nBut whatever it was makes me turn\
  \ now, back to the cathedral to gingerly walk up the steps towards its open doors,\
  \ knowing my fellow pilgrims are following behind me."
