Text: "I\u2019m fifteen, and in Kochi, India. It\u2019s absolutely chaotic. The colour\
  \ of saris vibrant and the masala chai the most delicious thing ever. Myself and\
  \ six others arrive at the Christian orphanage Don Bosco, where we are to stay at\
  \ for eight days, incredibly nervous about us foreigners being in these boys home,\
  \ but as we step outside onto the cracked basketball court, the sound of drums echo\
  \ out from the concrete walls of the building and we are enveloped in the most touching\
  \ welcoming ceremony. \n\nA small boy of about eleven approaches us with a tin dish\
  \ of fire and circles it around our faces, while another draws on our foreheads\
  \ with sandalwood paste. The smell is intoxicating. We follow the drummers, all\
  \ wearing traditional Keralan outfits and body paint, down the hallway and into\
  \ a room where chairs are set up , with ours at the front facing the \u201Caudience\u201D\
  . One by one each boy comes up and presents us with a rose. I catch the eye of one\
  \ about my age and he gives me the sweetest nervous little smile then looks away.\
  \ \n\nBy pure luck we were at Don Bosco during Christmas, and on our third night\
  \ we were invited to a joint celebration with the boys and girls centres. A stage\
  \ was set up on the basketball court, and we all sat on the grass beneath fairy\
  \ lights, huge multi coloured star shaped paper lanterns, and homemade santa hats,\
  \ strung from the hoop to the trees and the balcony of the building. The girls performed\
  \ a traditional dance item, each of them in a different coloured sari with intricate\
  \ henna snaking up their arms, and gold jewellery adorning their wrists, necks and\
  \ ears. The young boys stood in a tight group dressed up as angels and kings and\
  \ sung carols in Malayalam, their high pitched voices spreading across the field.\
  \ We were transfixed. And in complete awe. These children, younger and the same\
  \ age as us, had no family yet their smiles and joy for life radiated from their\
  \ bodies. \n\nWe danced together in the intense night-time heat to Bollywood hits\
  \ and Indian remixes of pop songs we had heard back home. This night, we broke through\
  \ the barrier separating them and us. We ate dinner sitting together in a circle\
  \ on the grass, attempting to shovel dal makhani, rice and paratha into our mouths\
  \ with just our one hand, chatting and laughing together. As they talked about sports,\
  \ football, and how they wanted a love marriage, not an arranged marriage, it made\
  \ us realise that even though our circumstances were worlds away we weren\u2019\
  t so different after all."
