Text: "I left home in 2015 and I came back after two years and a month. I took classes\
  \ in NYC, Boston and San Diego. I drove through a snow storm in Massachusetts. I've\
  \ been in New Hampshire just for a concert; I went to ski in Vermont where I had\
  \ my first s'mores. I was in Miami for the Spring Break. I drunk fresh coconut water\
  \ in Dominican Republic. I've been in D.C. during the cherry blossom season but\
  \ was raining. I went to a Naval Academy Ball in Maryland. I lost my baggage in\
  \ Montreal, Canada, during the jazz festival. I\u2019ve been sick in Rhode Island.\
  \ I did boating through the Niagara Falls. I jumped in Saco River in Maine by a\
  \ tree during a Floatchella party. I've been in Chicago with no wind at all. I had\
  \ 4 months of rain in LA. I got married in Las Vegas. I drove through the Route\
  \ 66 in Arizona. I've been in Seattle with no rain. I had my honeymoon in Hawaii.\
  \ I drunk tequila in Tijuana. I peed in the Yellowstone National Park. I run in\
  \ the prairie next wild horses in Montana. I\u2019ve been on a continental divide\
  \ in Idaho. I run on the white sand of the Great Salt Lake in Utah. Ive seen the\
  \ northern lights in Alaska, snow in Texas and wild crocodiles in Louisiana. I drove\
  \ till Mississippi just because I wanted to be able to say I\u2019ve been in half\
  \ America. Most of the people can't experience so much in a whole life and I feel\
  \ so blessed for what I did in only 2 years. 25 states for 25 months. Hope my future\
  \ will be filled with new adventures around this beautiful world. Life is a gift\
  \ and we can't waste our time on this earth. Find what makes you happy, spread love\
  \ around you, never take anything for granted and always be thankful. Now I\u2019\
  m ready for leaving again to China for teaching English to kids and in the meanwhile\
  \ learning Chinese. Or maybe not, maybe I\u2019m heading to Argentina.."
