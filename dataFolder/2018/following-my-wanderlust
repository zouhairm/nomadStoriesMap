Text: "Have you ever wondered, what it would be like to drop everything and travel\
  \ the world? Well, four months ago I decided to bite the bullet and take a trip\
  \ to France for me the trip that started it all. So, with a little preparation,\
  \ and a few boarding passes later, I was ready for the adventure that would soon\
  \ further my wanderlust. Arriving in Paris, I honestly didn\u2019t have a clue on\
  \ what to expect, but I was ready to explore the city and see the history and the\
  \ culture throughout it. My first goals were to try the impressive cuisine France\
  \ had to offer, as well as to find my hotel. Searching for a restaurant was more\
  \ difficult than I expected, but my decision landed me on a petite kebab caf\xE9\
  , the food was spectacular, and the gentleman running the caf\xE9 was kind, energetic\
  \ and very interesting. After traveling for 24 hours, I was exhausted and ready\
  \ to call it a night. I set off to explore more of Paris, walking to different shops,\
  \ cafes, and at last, the Eiffel Tower. Even a mile away, it towered over everything\
  \ else around. I walked back to the hotel to prepare my belongings again, to travel\
  \ to Confolens, France the following day. I found a ride share service called BlaBla\
  \ Car, and over the next five hours I had a lovely conversation in French and in\
  \ English with the driver, as well as the other passengers. Arriving late to the\
  \ farm, my host family welcomed me, and had prepared an extravagant dinner. After,\
  \ they wanted to explain the duties and responsibilities I would have on the farm\
  \ to prepare me for the following day. Most of the work was with animals, which\
  \ for me was amazing. Two months down the line, I met a French woman who wanted\
  \ to show me Oradour-sur-Glane, a historical city destroyed by a German Waffen-SS\
  \ company on June 10th, 1944. Seeing the destruction and the brutality that once\
  \ took place set an uneasy feeling throughout the entire village. Every building\
  \ was destroyed; there were old rusted, twisted, hunks of metal that were once the\
  \ automobiles of that time. It is now a memorial site for the lives lost on that\
  \ day. What I found the most disturbing was a baby cradle with over 20 bullet holes\
  \ through the side. It has changed my outlook on life and honestly, I never expected\
  \ to see history like this in person, but I\u2019m grateful that I had the opportunity.\
  \ Overall, my journey to France was amazing and at times, the last thing I expected,\
  \ but I\u2019m looking forward to another adventure soon and seeing more of what\
  \ the world has to offer."
