Text: "\u201C All passengers must alight. Welcome to Leh\u201D declared our exhausted\
  \ driver. It had been a grueling and miserable 15-hour journey in this crammed jeep,\
  \ with frequent stops for vomiting, caused due to altitude sickness. Before I could\
  \ complain any further I checked myself. At 17 I had embarked on this solo journey\
  \ to one of the remotest parts of India, after many arguments at home,  \u201Cto\
  \ discover myself\u2019\u2019. \n\n\u201C What can I do today?\u201D I asked the\
  \ cheerful receptionist the next day. \u201CGo to the Phyang Gompha, it is nearby,\u201D\
  \ she said\n\nIn the early 2000\u2019s Google maps did not exist and asking around\
  \ was the only possible way of getting around. I soon learned that \u2018nearby\u2019\
  \ meant 15 kilometers away. The presence of the Indian army is huge is Ladhak due\
  \ to its strategic importance to India and the person I asked for directions was\
  \ a soldier. He offered to give me a lift in the army truck. The city girl in me\
  \ was inclined to refuse but the only other option was to walk, so I agreed. \n\n\
  \u201CHello. I show you. If you want\u201D said a woman in broken English, dressed\
  \ in the traditional Ladhaki Goucha. I had been staring at the beautiful frescos\
  \ on the wall, wishing there was someone who could tell me about it. And there she\
  \ was, Jinpa. Jinpa took me by the hand and showed me around the monastery and the\
  \ 900-year-old museum. Her English was broken and I did not speak a word of the\
  \ local language, yet there seemed to be an instant connection between us. She introduced\
  \ me to one of the Lamas who told me stories about the Gompa. \n\n\u201CCome home,\u201D\
  \ said Jinpa. I had been warned all my life about strangers and yet at that moment,\
  \ I decided to follow her. She offered me butter tea and some traditional biscuits\
  \ and told me about her life. Her grandfather came to India to flee the Chinese\
  \ persecution. The winter in Ladhak is harsh but Jinpa doesn't mind the cold because\
  \ she says \"heart warm\". When the time came for me to leave she stood up and went\
  \ to the kitchen. \u201CGive me your hand,\u201D she said and placed an exquisite\
  \ looking prayer beads. \u201C What is this for,\u201D I asked. \u201C This will\
  \ help you to trust your instincts,\u201D she said.\n\nOn my way back I hitchhiked,\
  \ just like the locals. While the lonely and arid mountains of Ladhak offer many\
  \ jewels, none is as valuable as the wisdom of the people who inhabit this small\
  \ yet enlightened ex-kingdom. They understand the Buddhist teaching of \"each of\
  \ us is connected through the heart to the entire universe \u2013 and so if you\
  \ get into the mind, you will see the universe\u201D."
