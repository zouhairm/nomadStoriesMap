Text: "The pleasant aroma of filter-coffee from my cuppa mixed with the fragrance\
  \ of \u2018rath-rani\u2019 vine climbing onto my balcony, the pungent muddy smell\
  \ from the floor of court-yard sprinkled with water for drawing \u2018rangoli\u2019\
  , collaborating with the loud chiming of bells from the nearby vibrant hill-top\
  \ temple of Goddess Devi, wafting in the thick morning air, intoxicated me. With\
  \ detached mind, while I sat cross-legged on the Swing in my court-yard sipping\
  \ coffee, my eyes scanned the early morning usual sights at the backdrop of the\
  \ temple, when I heard a knock. \u201CAre you Lakshmi? Ramesh from Chennai sent\
  \ me for the darshan of Devi\u201D, an old lady stood smiling at the door. Hailing\
  \ from a family of atheists, I had only viewed the hill-top temple from my balcony.\
  \ Also, I had no acquaintance named Ramesh. As, I was about to decline, she pleaded,\
  \ \u201CBeta, you are my only hope to fulfill my last wish of the darshan of Goddess.\
  \ Shall we start to the temple, now?\u201D Something prompted me to take her hands\
  \ and lead the way to the hill. I had not had many outings in childhood or with\
  \ the workaholic husband of seven years. Being a recluse, my whole day was spent\
  \ in solitude within the four walls. \nEn route, the lady started singing hymn of\
  \ Goddess encompassing the beauty of the hill. In tune with the lyrics, the enchanting\
  \ scene emanating from nature engulfed me and blossomed happiness. It was the celebration\
  \ of nature, scattered colours embellished with pleasant sounds, divinely fragrance\
  \ of flowers, bird\u2019s flight giving a sense of freedom and pleasure. The trees\
  \ that flirted with the winds were like the messengers of Goddess, seeming to bend\
  \ their variegated branches, to bestow benediction upon my soul. On that eventful\
  \ day, it seemed, as if, I was flying and rest of the human habitat vanished into\
  \ the white maze of cloud. It was just me and her, caressing my mind so intensely.\
  \ \nI blindfolded followed the lady into the temple. I was mesmerized with the exquisite\
  \ stone carvings of ancient India. Minutely carved zodiac signs, various figurines\
  \ zoomed to life. I felt being transformed, melted and amalgamate into the serene\
  \ divinity. Finally, my eyes rested on the glowing diminutive idol of Devi and my\
  \ whole body shuddered. Momentarily, a flicker of light emerging from her sparkling\
  \ diamond nose-pin entered me. My hands rested on my stomach, I felt a life kicking.\
  \ Yes, my daughter! After seven years of futile attempts. The gift of life from\
  \ Mother Nature, the Goddess!"
