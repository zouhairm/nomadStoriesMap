Text: "Grief and fear led me to India, deep into the healing home of Ayurveda.  \n\
  \ \nAgain, I sit naked being lathered in oil, weeping as tears stream down my face,\
  \ my nose running like never before.  With a mixture of surprise and grave concern\
  \ my therapist, Shanti, asks if I am too tired and do I want a massage?  \u201C\
  Yes, it\u2019s ok\u201D I say, perplexed by her concern, surely many people have\
  \ much to release here?  \n \nAnother therapist who speaks better English is called.\
  \  I reassure her I am simply tired and to tell Shanti I am ok.  She offers a foot\
  \ massage, which I accept, but no tissue. Given my emotional state, I assumed that\
  \ would be an obvious need.  Eventually I ask for one and she passes me a towel\
  \ which is later used to lay my face on but I don\u2019t mind.   \n\nSmothered in\
  \ oil I lay on the mattress on the floor while she massages me with her feet.  She\
  \ grips the ends of a towel hooked over a rope suspended from the ceiling to hold\
  \ her weight.  Once done, I move to the massage bed for another massage as she sterilizes\
  \ the mat on the floor with disinfectant and a towel using her feet much the same\
  \ way you might clean a floor.  I give her a tip, take my medication and leave.\
  \  In the Ayurvedic garden I sip warm herb infused water.\n \nShanti is signalling\
  \ me to the bathing area.  Each day a different bathing lady washes me, but never\
  \ Shanti. I\u2019m ushered into a room, adjoining the usual one, where a small,\
  \ weathered portable aluminium bath awaits. A few sprigs of medicinal herbs float\
  \ in the water.  She instructs me to feel the water temperature, I feel it\u2019\
  s too hot. \u201CIt\u2019s fine\u201D she says, yet swiftly adds a small bucket\
  \ of cold.  I still think it\u2019s too hot.  She undresses me and I step into the\
  \ bath. \u201CNo like a baby\u201D she says.   \n \nI lower myself into the small\
  \ bath, my legs hanging over the edge to fit and I relax into the soothing water\
  \ as she sits just outside the door.  \n \nWe laugh as she remarks, \u201CBig baby,\
  \ you baby, you have baby!\u201D.  My mind drifts as we laugh and I recall a farewell\
  \ letter from a colleague a decade ago \u2018no matter how stressed you are, you\
  \ always find something to laugh at.\u2019  The words give me strength, both then\
  \ and throughout my life since.  \n\nMore laughter as another therapist approaches,\
  \ we all laugh at my indignity, yet I am so relaxed.  A male voice approaches, snapping\
  \ me out of my state of peace, but I need not worry, Shanti fiercely guards my door.\
  \  It was at that moment I notice my pubic hair and realise how completely naked\
  \ I am."
