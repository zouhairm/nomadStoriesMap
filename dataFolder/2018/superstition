Text: "I walked along the narrow wall of mud separating one rice paddy from another\
  \ while Achmad explained the 100 day growing cycle of rice. In one plot we could\
  \ see rice grain scattered on top of the mud. In another, a seven day old batch\
  \ had sprouted six inches above the soil. \n\nApparently the rice will eventually\
  \ be transplanted further into the paddy where it will continue to grow and, God\
  \ willing, will survive the numerous swooping birds until harvest.\n\nBack on dry\
  \ land Edwin tells me that his friend once floated a candle into the middle of a\
  \ rice paddy to see a hovering ghost head above the flame. \n\nMy surprised reaction\
  \ prompts the two college students to begin an Indonesian / English banter between\
  \ the two of them about something called \u2018Jumping Candy\u2019. They laugh while\
  \ trying to translate the meaning of one of the local ghost stories common to Indonesia.\n\
  \nAccording to Muslim tradition a person is bound in burial sheets when they die,\
  \ their legs and arms wrapped tightly together like a mummy with the sheets tied\
  \ above their head with a string. If the deceased person\u2019s family forgets to\
  \ untie this string before they are put into the ground, that person will come back\
  \ as a ghost called the \u2018Jumping Candy\u2019. Jumping, because their feet are\
  \ tied together and they cannot walk. Candy, because they are wrapped up like a\
  \ piece of candy. The ghost\u2019s face is exposed and in order to escape an encounter,\
  \ you must run in a serpentine path since the ghost can only hop in a straight line.\n\
  \nI ask if they believe these spooky stories and they give an emphatic yes, everyone\
  \ does. They in turn ask if we have ghost\u2019s in America and I tell about haunted\
  \ houses and explain that some people believe in ghosts, while other think they\
  \ are actually demons and still others do not believe they are anything at all.\
  \ \n\nSeeing is believing in America, we can be a skeptical crowd. Aliens are not\
  \ a shared obsession it appears and they find it preposterous that we could believe\
  \ in life on other planets.\n\nRiding my borrowed bicycle back through the crowded\
  \ streets, between two devout Muslin men who\u2019s faith in the intangible is strong,\
  \ I smile at how far-fetched my own Western beliefs must appear to them. \n\nThey\
  \ use the word tolerant often and I\u2019m grateful that we are tolerant of each\
  \ other\u2019s explanations of the uncertain in this mysterious world."
