Text: "\u2018Leave your phones at home and prepare for the real Bolivian boondocks\u2019\
  \ warned a website for gringos heading for the Pampas tours of wetland on the hem\
  \ of the Amazon. We had readied ourselves for the alligators and piranhas on our\
  \ swamp tour, but a light dip in online information on the tour\u2019s base-town,\
  \ Rurrenabaque, suggested that any forecast of imminent danger instead lay in the\
  \ prospect of being nipped by professional thieves that lurked amid the brush. Tour\
  \ guides, \u2018sick\u2019 pedestrians and the town\u2019s notorious moped gangs\
  \ were not to be trusted, the website cautioned. I promptly unpacked my digital\
  \ camera and packed a sense of unease. \nOur journey out of La Paz bore no consolation.\
  \ Our bus, as well as having to brave the Slip \u2018n\u2019 Slide of Bolivia\u2019\
  s finest glac\xE9 mud, was at various points stopped by anti-trafficking police\
  \ patrolling entries to and from the jungle, their hefty guns auguring unfavourably\
  \ for our concerns of savannah-town crime. Seventeen hours later, in dipped moonlight,\
  \ we trundled into Rurrenabaque.\nWe were swiftly bundled off the coach into the\
  \ town\u2019s pastel boulevards, flanked by thick banana-tree marginalia that parroted\
  \ the verdant jungle above. Weaving through the darkened streets in search of our\
  \ hostel, lo, we were met by the silhouette of a forewarned moped gang approaching\
  \ us. Five or six big burly men draped over a single moped, like a bunch of swollen\
  \ grapes balancing on a smoky rolling coin. They pulled up and teetered alongside\
  \ us, muttering a chorus of loose slang. We considered panic, looking amongst us\
  \ for an indication of proceeding. But all frenzy dissolved when one of our group\
  \ whispered; \u2018Have... you seen their T-Shirts?\u2019\nThe stout horde, with\
  \ the all the machismo that you might envisage from a pack of Bolivian petrolheads,\
  \ were sporting a range of fluorescent t-shirts with such slogans as: \u2018Figure\
  \ Skating Champion 2001,\u2019 \u2018Belieber 4ever\u2019 and \u2018Sk8r Girl.\u2019\
  \ Their expressions carried no hint of irony, and it seemed they were entirely unaware\
  \ of their fangirl fashion. They drove off, and we were left scratching our heads.\
  \ \nWe were welcomed on our savannah tour the following day by a portly, diamante-clad\
  \ tour guide, who told us that the town received a weekly import of second-hand\
  \ children's apparel from Canada that was the town\u2019s only clothing source.\
  \ Of all the tropical sights that the week offered, the most enduring remains those\
  \ beefy Bolivian men unwittingly declaring their allegiance to Western pop culture."
