Text: "Spa Day at Lake Titicaca\n\nOn the Bolivian shores of Lake Titicaca, I pushed\
  \ my way past the overwhelming marketing shouts of the boat tour operators.  Carefully,\
  \ I walked across the rickety, wooden boat dock and arrived where the captains were\
  \ readying their well-experienced vessels. \n\nI approached a sun-weathered boat\
  \ captain and asked if he would take me to the floating islands.  Within minutes\
  \ I was off traversing the highest navigable body of water in the world as I happily\
  \ accepted the captain\u2019s invitation to stay on an island with his family.\n\
  \nThe main dwelling where the family lived was a single room that appeared furniture-less.\
  \  The guest accommodations, a  physical representation of the family\u2019s spirit,\
  \ was a smaller, separate building, with comfy sets of bunk beds and amenities the\
  \ family seemed to have deprived themselves of.\n\nAfter a day of exploring, I approached\
  \ as the mother told the two girls to wash up for supper.  The oldest grabbed a\
  \ well-used, plastic bucket, taking it to the shoreline and scooped up ice cold\
  \ water.  The youngest scoured the rocky shoreline and picked up two perfectly flattened\
  \ rocks.  They sat down on a small slab of cement that extended from the housing\
  \ foundation and each took a rock. Fully clothed, they dipped their tiny hands into\
  \ the bucket and splashed water on their exposed skin while they used the rocks\
  \ to rub against their skin, in the manner which you would use a washcloth.\n\n\
  Captivated by the scene that unfolded before me; I sat with the girls, reached into\
  \ my backpack and pulled out my liquid soap and shower scrunchie.  They looked at\
  \ the items with the inquisitiveness and innocence of a beginner\u2019s mind.  I\
  \ dipped the scrunchie into the frigid water and poured liquid soap onto the scrunchie.\
  \ The girls' eyes widened as I rubbed my hands quickly over the scrunchie to create\
  \ a rich lather.  I then washed their legs as they laughed and giggled at my touch.\
  \  They squeezed the soap onto their hands and playfully made it stretch between\
  \ their fingers.  As children will do, they curiously put their hands to their mouths\
  \ to taste the frothy, sweet-smelling lather.  I raced to stop their hands and vigorously\
  \ shook my head as I urgently said \u201CNo\u201D.  More giggles ensued.  Sheer\
  \ delight and loud shrieks erupted when they learned that the soap made bubbles.\n\
  \nA delicious smile comes to my face when I think what further mischief may have\
  \ come from the items I left with those girls."
