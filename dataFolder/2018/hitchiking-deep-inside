Text: "April 2012.\nA phonecall from my mother just learned me that my grand mother\
  \ passed away. I talked with her about that 6months ago, before to leave France\
  \ to go in Australia. At this moment, she said to me \"don't come back if anything\
  \ happened, but do something of your travel which worth it\". \nI already had in\
  \ my mind the idea of hitchiking in Australia. I didn't expect doing more than 20000km\
  \ hitchiking during these 6months which followed this call!\n2weeks were enough\
  \ to quit my job in Melbourne and to prepare myself. First step was Tasmania, like\
  \ a test for me. After 2weeks, I will know if I want to do that in the main land.\n\
  After 8days, I knew already I wanted to keep going for few months. I experimented\
  \ in 8days the hights and lows which are compulsory part of a travel like that.\
  \ When I landed in Launceston, I had no idea where to goi, my plan was to hitchike\
  \ and go in the same direction of the first person who pick me up : Burnie. There,\
  \ I met Leo, a german backpacker with a van who spontaneously asked me if the day\
  \ after I wanted to go to Table cape. I promised myself to be yesman. And I was\
  \ for the next 6 months. What I didn't know at this moment is I wont spend 1 day\
  \ with Leo but 6! walking, discovering, talking, that was an amazing journey. After\
  \ a night in Cradle mountain, Leo had to go to Devonport so I continued alone. On\
  \ Day 8, in Queenstown, the low arrived: A guy just destroyed my tent with me inside\
  \ during the night and kick me. I couldn't find him after that but I stayed there\
  \ for the reste of this cold night. This experience gave me the taste of keep going\
  \ during few months. And that's the best choice of my life!\nDuring the following\
  \ months, I discovered the great ocean road, I met some amazing people who gave\
  \ me a roof, food, and share with me more than everything : their time. I crossed\
  \ the nullarbord plain with a guy who was running away queensland cops and was going\
  \ to western australia because cops don't share informations between theses states.\
  \ I climb some 70m high tree close to esperance, worked in an aboriginal community,\
  \ be picked up by great moscou circus and so many stories to tell. The last one\
  \ of this short story will be Pieter, who originaly picked me up for 300km. Then\
  \ we spent 5 days together around Ayer's rock and king's canyon. But the crazy part\
  \ of this story is one month later, after he went to Darwin and me to Cairns, I\
  \ saw a car stopped to pick me up. That was Pieter. Same guys, same scenario, but\
  \ 1month and 2500km."
