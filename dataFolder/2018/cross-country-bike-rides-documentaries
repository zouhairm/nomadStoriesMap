Text: "Over the last decade, I have traveled across the country and around the globe,\
  \ visiting new places such as India and Costa Rica, exploring new cultures such\
  \ as the Creole culture in southern Louisiana, and attending amazing events such\
  \ as the Cannes Film Festival in Cannes, France. However, out of all the travel\
  \ experiences I\u2019ve had, I\u2019d say my most significant experience would be\
  \ when I cycled across the country to raise awareness about poverty in America and\
  \ created a documentary about the whole experience. \n\nIn the summer of 2011, I\
  \ joined a group of cyclists from the Lasallian Volunteers to cycle across the country\
  \ to raise awareness about poverty in America. Dipping our wheels in the Pacific\
  \ Ocean in Warrington, Oregon, we cycled 3600 miles from west to east, stopping\
  \ in 52 cities across 13 states, ending our journey two months later by dipping\
  \ our wheels in the Atlantic Ocean in Long Branch, New Jersey. Along the way, at\
  \ each city, we connected with social service providers, homeless shelters, food\
  \ kitchens, and the underserved population, hearing their stories and struggles,\
  \ sharing our experiences, performing volunteer work ourselves, and capturing it\
  \ all on camera. That's right! My particular assignment on this journey was to produce\
  \ and direct a feature-length documentary of this experience, as well as take photos\
  \ and post weekly update videos throughout the ride. The weekly photos and video\
  \ updates gained a nationwide following, earning the attention of several local\
  \ and regional news stations. In December of 2011, the documentary premiered in\
  \ Rome, Italy to a standing ovation.\n\nI found this experience especially meaningful\
  \ because in addition to the fact that I just cycled across the country, I was able\
  \ to connect with people from many socioeconomic stratifications and witness the\
  \ contributions they made to their communities in hopes of breaking the cycle of\
  \ poverty in America. I was able to capture their story on film and share that story\
  \ with the world, all the while seeing the country, meeting new people, volunteering\
  \ and giving back to communities, and honing my craft. \n\nHowever, my biggest takeaway\
  \ from this experience was that although the experience seemed daunting at first\
  \ (I would have to cycle 3600 miles AND produce a documentary), I realized that\
  \ if you take a small leap of faith and push yourself outside your comfort zone,\
  \ the rewards are priceless! This is a life-long memory I will treasure forever."
