Text: "To \u201Cget lost and never come back\u201D has two meanings.  One, your partner\
  \ or loved one clearly doesn\u2019t want you in their life anymore.  Or two, to\
  \ get lost in a world of travel and never return.  I did return.  Circumstances\
  \ drove me to.  But I am forever lost in my favourite country yet \u2013 Iceland.\
  \  \n\nIceland\u2019s popularity is rapidly booming.  For those willing to pay the\
  \ price, this destination is an escape from their busy lives.  It is a chance to\
  \ explore a country so beautiful, so spectacular that, for me, I simply can\u2019\
  t resist the desire to return.  \n\nIceland in winter? A bold idea some might say,\
  \ but who could resist the charm of the land of fire and ice.  Furthermore, working\
  \ on a local cattle farm for the month of February was a chance to develop a local\
  \ connection, experience Icelandic lifestyle and explore pockets of this country\
  \ that were perhaps off the beaten-path.  \n\nWith no two words of English, the\
  \ farmer, Gottfre\xF0, my friend and I developed a playful relationship where singing\
  \ in the cow shed became a regular pastime.  Our working routine consisted of feeding\
  \ the cows on our own before Gottfre\xF0 joined us for the milking.  After naming\
  \ all 30 cows, knowing their individual personalities and certainly getting up close\
  \ and personal with each one, we also developed a local connection with your not-so-typical\
  \ Icelandic local.  Family lunch was standard, consisting of meat and potatoes.\
  \  One day the wife asked \u201CDo you know what meat that is?\u201D  \u201CFoal\u201D\
  \ was the answer.  The common saying, \u201CI\u2019m so hungry I could eat a horse\u201D\
  \ immediately lost all meaning for us.  \n\nOn days off, we went up the mountains\
  \ \u2013 trekking, exploring plummeting waterfalls and falling down icy slopes.\
  \  Night times, after our evening routine with the cows and Gottfre\xF0, were taken\
  \ up by hunting the Northern Lights.  Fortunately, they graced us with their presence\
  \ on more than one occasion.  The striking and awe-inspiring display of dancing\
  \ colours and patterns were an absolute highlight of our adventure in Iceland. \n\
  \nOur connections formed in Iceland with both Gottfre\xF0 and his wife, the cows,\
  \ the mountains and the Northern Lights, are not something you can ever forget and\
  \ strengthened my love for this country.  Iceland is a majestic world unto its own.\
  \  I will forever be lost in my memories of this wild and enchanting country.  The\
  \ plan to return is imminent."
