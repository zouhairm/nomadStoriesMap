Text: "The invigorating sea breeze at Marine drive in Mumbai can be the only therapist\
  \ you need to get rid of all your woes. Sitting by the tetra-pod stones, I found\
  \ myself contemplating about my rock bottom phase. I glared at the noisy waves and\
  \ asked myself, \"What do you want from life?\" The only answer I got was \"Escape\"\
  . So, I unlocked my phone and booked a flight to Bali, Indonesia. Being from a conservative\
  \ Indian family, I had never traveled solo to another city, let alone another country!\
  \ However, I always knew I wanted to break stereotypes. So, there I was at the airport,\
  \ extremely nervous, questioning myself about my sanity to make this outrageous\
  \ decision. \n\nAfter hours of cursing myself and feeling nauseous on the plane,\
  \ I could see the serene blue waters through the white fluffy clouds. I was actually\
  \ feeling the high I thought is only made up in the cliched movies. As soon as I\
  \ landed, all my fears disappeared and one thing I discovered in just a few minutes\
  \ was, even though the people here weren't very rich, they were content, happy and\
  \ very hospitable.\n\n My resort, La Joya Biu Biu was on a cliff in and was not\
  \ very expensive, so I didn\u2019t have very high expectations but it left me stunned\
  \ by how exquisite it was and how it made me feel so close to nature. I spent my\
  \ evening in the Jacuzzi at the edge of the cliff watching the alluring teal shades\
  \ of the ocean waves hitting the moist mighty rocks with salty wind blowing my hair.\
  \ I took all the time to absorb that enchanting moment and I realized, even though\
  \ life was pushing me to the edge figuratively, being pushed to the edge literally\
  \ wasn\u2019t bad at all. That evening was the highlight of my trip. \n\nI fearlessly\
  \ started exploring hidden spots with untouched beauty. I was confident enough to\
  \ talk to strangers and delve into their stories. The exotic green rice fields in\
  \ Bali, so soothing to the eyes are something one should never miss.  What I liked\
  \ the most here though, was their vibrant and colorful culture. I actually visited\
  \ many of the local houses to experience their food and lifestyle. I still can\u2019\
  t get enough of their Nasi Goreng which is a type of fried rice. The markets in\
  \ the villages have some antique articles to offer and one can find some of the\
  \ finest spices to tickle your taste buds.\n\nI think this trip was one of my best\
  \ decisions and even though life may push you to the edge sometimes, don\u2019t\
  \ forget, the world is yours and you can pick your own divine edge to escape to."
