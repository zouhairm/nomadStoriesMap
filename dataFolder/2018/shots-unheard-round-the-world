Text: "I hadn\u2019t intended to do a silent meditation retreat while in Costa Rica.\
  \ However, exploring cloud forests and rafting through rapids hadn\u2019t yet cured\
  \ the news addiction I\u2019d been nursing since the months before the last presidential\
  \ election. \nSo I joined thirty other participants in five days of complete silence.\
  \ We weren\u2019t even supposed to make eye contact with others, as it required\
  \ \u201Cenergy\u201D we needed to be directing inward. By the third day, I was going\
  \ slightly nuts. Walking was my best defense against insanity. I\u2019d watch hummingbirds\
  \ by the feeders, pet the resident cat, or follow a hopping toad through the forest.\n\
  On one of my walks, I saw a guy named Paul staring intently into a tree. We\u2019\
  d spoken during a social mixer before the retreat. He was about sixty and lived\
  \ in Las Vegas. A former tennis pro, he\u2019d been, in his words, \u201Cexactly\
  \ good enough not to make any money.\u201D Now he coached tennis and invested in\
  \ health clubs.\nRather than bother him, I cast my eyes down and kept walking. As\
  \ I passed, he motioned me over, a minor flouting of the rules that I appreciated.\
  \ He pointed at a nearby tree were two howler monkeys sprawled over a branch. Contrary\
  \ to their booming Jurassic Park shrieks, they were cute. Long, curling tails, distinguished-looking\
  \ beards. After a couple of minutes, the monkeys darted away. Paul and I shared\
  \ a smile and went our separate ways.\nI ended up achieving the meditative equivalent\
  \ of a runner\u2019s high for much of the rest of the retreat. Then it was over.\
  \ I could speak again, but I didn\u2019t really want to. Before leaving, I went\
  \ down to the retreat center\u2019s gift shop to get a WiFi signal and check in\
  \ with my girlfriend. Paul was there browsing the sweets they sold that were made\
  \ on-site by residents. One message from my girlfriend just said \u201CVegas,\u201D\
  \ followed by a broken-heart emoji. With a couple of clicks, I was reading about\
  \ Stephen Paddock murdering over seventy people at a Las Vegas concert a couple\
  \ of days earlier. My eyes swung to Paul. \n\u201CDid you hear about Las Vegas?\u201D\
  \ I asked.\nHe shook his head no. I thrust my phone towards him. His already fair-skinned\
  \ face went white. \n\u201CYou can use my phone to make some calls if you want,\u201D\
  \ I said.\n\u201CThanks,\u201D he muttered, but he handed the phone back to me.\
  \ He took a moment to compose himself then gestured with his eyes towards the jungle.\
  \ He took a couple of steps before turning back to me. I fell in stride next to\
  \ him, turned off my phone, and we walked in silence for the next two hours."
