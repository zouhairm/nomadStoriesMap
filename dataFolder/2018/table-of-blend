Text: "As I browsed rows of typical Japanese house in the cold winter, I was a bit\
  \ shocked. On the window of one of the houses, there was a paper written, \u201C\
  Welcome, Syauqi!\u201D with a smiley face. This must be the place.\nI texted my\
  \ host that I am outside, not sure of how to open the gate. Then I heard footsteps\
  \ going down the stairs, door being unlocked and opened. Finally, I met my Couchsurfing\
  \ host for the first time. He welcomed me to his house, which is warmer than the\
  \ 4\xB0C outside, a temperature that is not familiar to some Indonesian like me.\n\
  \ \u201CHave you had dinner?\u201D I asked hungrily, \u201CI bring some Indonesian\
  \ food, maybe you want to try some, if you let me use the kitchen.\u201D\nHe did,\
  \ so I heated beef rendang and cooked Indonesian style noodles. My host also helped\
  \ me with the cooking, with the utensils, and appliances. Finally, foods were ready\
  \ and I served them on the table.\n\u201CHow do you eat in Indonesia? Chopsticks\
  \ or spoon or forks or something else?\u201D asked my host.\n\u201CTraditionally,\
  \ with our bare hands. We also usually eat with rice.\u201D\nThen he took some rice\
  \ for both of us and washed his hands. I washed my hands as well, before sitting\
  \ down. \u201CItadakimasu!\u201D (bon appetit!) we said and we began to eat with\
  \ our bare hands.\nSo, there we were, an Indonesian and a Japanese, in a Japanese\
  \ house, eating Indonesian meals and Japanese rice, with Indonesian and Japanese\
  \ manner mixed.\nDuring the dinner, we exchanged ideas about the cultural difference\
  \ of Japan and Indonesia. Turned out he had interest about Indonesia as his older\
  \ brother had lived in Indonesia for a year. He was surprised to learn some unexpectable\
  \ things about Indonesia, and I was also surprised to hear some unexpected stories\
  \ of Japanese society. We exchanged stories, we laughed, we discussed a lot of things,\
  \ and we shared a lot of insights about our own cultures. It was nice 3-hour dinner,\
  \ and it was a good start to mingle with my host.\nSeveral weeks before that, I\
  \ had doubt on Couchsurfing. I was afraid if my host is a serial killer or I would\
  \ experience bad things. Maybe my host was also afraid if the food I bring is poisoned.\
  \ In the end, both of us are human being and despite our difference and the fact\
  \ that we had not met each other before, we can connect with each other, just like\
  \ our dinner table full of Indonesian and Japanese things all blended. Believe me,\
  \ it was delicious."
