Text: "One day being tired of the road and people I went where hills and deserts thrive.\
  \ That was the place where I met a hermit who feeds peacocks on every sunrise and\
  \ sunset. I heard how birds are thanking him. I rested in a giant banyan tree. Those\
  \ trees have their roots outside the earth, therefore they stay alive forever. I\
  \ was thinking about a human, the being and the eternity. I felt very close and\
  \ very distant to this world at the same time. I wanted to embrace everything and\
  \ everybody and to sing about it. Then I heard children jollying.\n\nSeveral families\
  \ live in a hilly field. Some strawy little houses, wicker fenced shower, several\
  \ cows and a field of yellow flowers (these are for insects; everything among them\
  \ grows for humans). That is enough. I enter one of the houses and see a woman covered\
  \ her face with a veil making a paste for chapattis. I sit by her side. I have a\
  \ pair of small sized psalteries with me. She points to them and asks what is that.\
  \ I am so happy I have brought them with me. I can use it as a substitute for language.\
  \ I play. More listeners are gathering around me. Everybody looks very curious and\
  \ giggle \u2013 that is probably the first time an alien is visiting this family.\
  \ Few minutes after I am being served chai \u2013 black tea with milk, spices and\
  \ sugar. It is the fine gesture of Indian hospitality and a good reason to rest.\
  \ \u201CBetter mood means more sugar\u201D, - smiles toothless old man, \u201Cyou\
  \ will be full of energy\u201D. Oh, if I could only somehow transfer that laughter\
  \ to you\u2026\n\nHallowed be. Let the things happen and flow. We are destined to\
  \ feel and to know so much! It is common to believe one needs less and less as time\
  \ passes. Mother Theresa wished people not to live without life and not to love\
  \ without love. I am wishing the same too for all of us."
