Text: "Woah, WOOOAH, WoAH, woaH. There are many way to describe \u2018woah\u2019 and\
  \ similarly there are many ways to describe New York. The city where everything\
  \ goes and everyone fits. It\u2019s just a matter of finding your \u2018woahhhh!!!\u2019\
  . \n\nIt\u2019s hard to write about an experience during it, or even days after.\
  \ It takes time for the present to become past and for you to be able to look back\
  \ on it at all. To process, understand and make sense of it. There\u2019s no real\
  \ time frame on how long that may take. One day you definitely wake up and it clicks.\
  \ I think I\u2019ve always been like that \u2013 from adventures I\u2019ve had in\
  \ New Zealand (see \u2013 \u201DA \u2018remarkable\u2019 story. The New Zealand\
  \ Story\u201D), and a year spent in Norway. I see clearly later on. No different\
  \ here. Especially looking back on the first few weeks in this outrageously outrageous\
  \ city.\n\nI think it\u2019s only right to introduce my \u2018partner in crime\u2019\
  , before I dive further into my ramble. Elise. My better, funner half. Who shares\
  \ the same drive and goals as well as being my wonderfully lovely girlfriend. We\
  \ both moved to Brooklyn at the start of September. With aspirations, intensions\
  \ and ambitions to both live and work in New York. Now, I know what you may be thinking\
  \ \u2013 \u2018oh god\u2019 here we go again, another cliche -the grass is always\
  \ greener on the other side and a better life awaits in fresher waters. And to some\
  \ extent that is not wrong \n\nAs I was saying and as the sub heading of \u2018\
  part one\u2019 suggests, the first few weeks here were quite exciting to say the\
  \ least. An element of naive optimism was practically radiating out of us both.\
  \ The jobs we would find and the places we would base ourselves in. The purpose\
  \ we would find to live, work and survive here. It was nothing but exciting. So\
  \ many plans and ideas. Naturally anything felt possible here. Days were spent working\
  \ on self profiles, resumes and cover notes online. We sought after work in all\
  \ shapes and sizes. However it was too distracting being where we were for the first\
  \ time together and the allure of exploring this great city, meeting new people\
  \ and generally having the craic was too, too much.\n\nDays quickly turned into\
  \ buckets lists, activities and exploration voyages to every burrow, bustling bar\
  \ and beautiful new spot. Seeing the brilliantly, blissful craziness that was New\
  \ York City. I could probably write another ten blogs about all the happenings we\
  \ got up to.  \n\nTo be continued.."
