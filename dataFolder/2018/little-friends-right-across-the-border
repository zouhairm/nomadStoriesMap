Text: "Through the windows of the bus, the impressive Andes mountains were highlighted,\
  \ always there, on sight. Always gentle, inviting everyone to deep reflections over\
  \ the hugeness of the Universe.\nEngrossed amidst the cinematic landscape by my\
  \ side, I felt on my back the sweet touch of a child finger, poking me.\nThe girl\u2019\
  s look focused right on the packet of biscuits I held on my hands. After an intense\
  \ wordless dialogue, I agreed to the request, cheering up the young child and her\
  \ parents, who stepped off the bus a few minutes later.\nThe funny episode was part\
  \ of the time I spent in the Argentinian province of Mendoza.\nThe region, known\
  \ for producing more than 70% of the country\xB4s wine, offers all the conditions\
  \ for any tourist\u2019s dream trip. \nBut I was there to experience the adventure\
  \ of living away from home, with the bonus of collaborating in a local NGO, which\
  \ supports kids who live in poor neighborhoods.\nKids who are not used to having\
  \ ice cream at Plaza Independencia, the city\u2019s largest square. Kids whose parents\
  \ are unlikely to get together and try the notes of a typical Malbec.\nIn a sunny\
  \ afternoon, I arrived at the NGO and was welcome with a solemn \u201CMorning, teacher!\u201D\
  , coming from \xC1ngel, a 5 year-old boy. But in that relationship, marked with\
  \ different kinds of exchange, the role of teaching was his.\nAmong my masters was\
  \ the cute Luc\xEDa, who told me about what she did not like in her area. She mentioned\
  \ the people who lived in the streets, the women who were abused by the husbands,\
  \ and the garbage thrown in the acequias, channels used for the distribution of\
  \ water.\nI told her that Brazil had the same problems. I took a map and showed\
  \ her the nearness that made us neighbors in the world. Since we are so close, we\
  \ can help each other, right?, she said.\nWhat she didn\xB4t know is that she, as\
  \ well as her fellow colleagues, had already helped me a lot, with the overdose\
  \ of affection we had shared over those weeks, through the easy smiles, the tight\
  \ hugs and the rewarding conversations.\nAs the end of the experience got closer,\
  \ I said goodbye to the little ones. On the last day, I held \xC1ngel in my arms\
  \ and told him I was going to take him to Brazil with me. He waved his head positively,\
  \ but his mom, who watched closely, smiled and said: \u201CI'd rather you come back\
  \ one day!\u201D\nI will come back to see my dear neighbors again. I will be back\
  \ sure of seeing them with the same energy, the essencial fuel to the changes the\
  \ next generation needs to be happier than ours."
