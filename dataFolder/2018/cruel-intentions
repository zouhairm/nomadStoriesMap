Text: "I hold onto the window ledge as I attempt to coax my foot out of my mud encrusted\
  \ boots. That almost orange, smooth stained wood of the Himalayan guesthouses has\
  \ come to be synonymous with the removal of soggy socks and sharp, fresh air.\_\n\
  \nA high pitched, unintelligible obscenity draws my gaze from the dirt under my\
  \ fingernails on the window sill to the barren plateau outside the window. Dry,\
  \ hard ground is masquerading as a paddock. The noise has come from a young boy\
  \ in the middle of it. He is short and stocky, with a thunderous brow. \n\nHe is\
  \ taunting two dogs; a young, skinny pup with fluffy black fur - almost husky-esque\
  \ in his features. The other is a true scrapper; white, scruffy and a mix of god\
  \ only knows what.\_They cower from him as he pushes them and drags them by the\
  \ scruffs of their necks. He antagonises them and pits them against one another,\
  \ gritting his teeth as he does so.\n\nHis cruelty is a surprise amongst the prayer\
  \ flags.\n\nThe boy toes the puppy when it lies at his feet, the force of his kicks\
  \ growing stronger when it fails to react. As my foot finally frees itself from\
  \ the snugness of my boot, the boy walks away; done with his king of the pack act.\
  \ Bored.\n\nI make my way outside and bend down next to the puppy, who pays me no\
  \ attention as I begin to stroke the soft down of his fur. I run my fingers across\
  \ his belly; my fingers drum his ribs along the way and I wonder how long this little\
  \ dog will live. I look up to the mountains surrounding us and with a start, I wonder\
  \ how long the boy will live.\n\nAs if by apparition, the boy appears with the older\
  \ mutt and pushes him onto the pup. He wants them to fight. We do not speak the\
  \ same tongue, but I hold my palm up; Stop. He lifts his chin to me and pushes the\
  \ older dog once more; hoping for something, anything.\n\nI wonder if it is loneliness\
  \ or maybe jealously that has filled this boy with enmity. If it's the never ending\
  \ snake of foreigners delighting in the momentary novelty of his Himalaya and his\
  \ mother's guesthouse, that has tainted him with malevolence. Perhaps, when at the\
  \ mercy of Mother Nature and the oppressive rule of poverty, a child just wants\
  \ to have some kind of control. \n\nOr maybe, he's just cruel.\n\nJust days later\
  \ and a mere 24 hours since I was in Nepal, I am sitting on my lounge when I hear\
  \ of the earthquake. As the death toll rises and I recall those remote villages,\
  \ I think of that little boy and his dogs. \n\nI am reminded that it is usually\
  \ the world that is cruel first."
