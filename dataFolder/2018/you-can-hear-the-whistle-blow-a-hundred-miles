Text: "It\u2019s 2:00am. The train is wheezing past sleeping villages. I have an alarm\
  \ set for 4 tomorrow morning. And right now, I am looking outside into the dark,\
  \ trying to put into words the last 72 hours of my life, spent somewhere in the\
  \ Himalayas.\n\nThis year,  I decided to take my very first trek, alone. The trek\
  \ to Kedarkantha started from Sankri, a quaint village, made of folklores & little\
  \ girls with the warmest smiles.\n \nI woke early and started for our first camp\
  \ site, Juda-ka-Talab, accompanied by my guide , Pramod bhaiya . We walked through\
  \ a meandering forest trail lined on both sides by huge Pine trees, that smelt of\
  \ stars, snow & sunsets. Who knew what lay nestled between those trees, within the\
  \ dense jungle. Maybe there\u2019s a little hamlet, with a babbling stream. A grandma,\
  \ sitting by the fireplace in her wood hut , knitting and narrating tales of the\
  \ ancient times- of magic, of adventures, of misadventures, of dark nights and of\
  \ the morning sunshine. Or maybe, between those pine trees , somewhere, lay the\
  \ magic Faraway tree , home to Silky, the pixie. Evening at the campsite came with\
  \ hot soup and bonfire. I marvelled at the virgin snow all around- a blank canvas,\
  \ the sun & the moon used a myriad of colours on. The night saw little sleep and\
  \ the temperature had gone way below zero degrees. We set off at 3:30 am for the\
  \ summit climb, with the snowtrail lit by torchlight. Stars twinkled overhead ;\
  \ the dead silence broken only by the frequent whistles of Pramod bhaiya. And then,\
  \ we had the first downpour of snow. The swirling snowflakes had their own stories\
  \ to tell. It was surreal. \nThe last few kilometres were excruciating. It was a\
  \ 60 degree steep climb. I pushed on, one step at a time. With every step, I got\
  \ to know a little bit more about myself. I discovered the strength I had. Because\
  \ it\u2019s not the body that you got to tame, but the mind. And then, I took that\
  \ one final step. I looked down. That\u2019s when it all made sense. As I looked\
  \ at the endless peaks, the coloured sky and the valley below- time stopped for\
  \ me. I was in God\u2019s own land. No rules existed here. The peaks of the mountains\
  \ were resplendent with the changing colours of the sun. Magic had befallen on our\
  \ little world.\n\nIt was 24th of February,2018. I had conquered my fears. \n\n\
  There are a thousand stories within you. There lies the strength of a thousand Suns\
  \ within you. There are a thousand versions of you. You just need to reach within\
  \ your own self and find those. One step at a time."
