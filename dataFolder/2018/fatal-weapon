Text: "Fatal Weapon\n\nWhen I lifted the heavy suitcase to place it on the inspection\
  \ table, upon the request of the customs officer, I was smiling, and looked confident\
  \ and calm. I was comforting myself by thinking that it\u2019s only a standard procedure.\
  \ Since I was travelling alone, this huge suitcase is certain to attract the attention\
  \ of the customs. \n\nOh, 30 kilograms ... that\u2019s a bit heavy to lift up. I\
  \ was indeed exhausted! Nonetheless, I smiled even more cheerfully, when I looked\
  \ the officer in the eye. \n\u201COpen the suitcase and step aside\u201D, he ordered\
  \ me. While I was unzipping it, I swiftly recalled how I had packed my stuff. His\
  \ rushing questions were distracting me, yet I answered with full confidence: \u201C\
  No, I do not have anything to declare\u201D. Was I lying? No. In fact I did not\
  \ have any of what he listed: neither tobacco, no alcohols, nor electronics, nor\
  \ gold, nor raw food, nor plants, nor souvenirs ... only a small amount of foreign\
  \ money!\n\nWhen he flipped the bag open, his face changed. He took a deep breath,\
  \ looked at me, and instructed me to stay away from the suitcase. In a matter of\
  \ seconds, four more officers were inspecting every single item in my luggage. Those\
  \ are not customs personnel, I thought. I suspected them to be from the intelligence\
  \ apparatus.\n\nAmid my embarrassment, as everybody was looking at me, I caught\
  \ a glimpse of my belongings piled up on the bare table: on one side of the bag\
  \ were my clothes and underwear; on the other side, the four officers were going\
  \ through my purchases. What were they looking for? What did I miss to declare?\
  \ It was my first time to attend an international book fair, so I bought as many\
  \ books as I could afford, and as much as the weight-limit would allow. \n\nThe\
  \ chief officer signaled to me to follow him. My stomach sank to my knees. \n\n\
  What was supposed to be a mere 5-minute routine procedure had turned to be a very\
  \ long interrogation. All questions posed were answered, truthfully and honestly,\
  \ except for one: mine. Why are books forbidden in reactionary regimes? \n\nI was\
  \ desperately seeking an answer for my question. I was seeking knowledge: the exact\
  \ weapon I was carrying in my luggage."
