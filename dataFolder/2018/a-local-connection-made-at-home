Text: "In 2004,\n\n     Leading into my junior year of high school, my mother presented\
  \ my sisters and I with information on hosting a foreign exchange student. In my\
  \ memory our family farm had hosted two such adventurous youths from overseas, mom\
  \ remembers a few more. The two candidates, in a manila envelope, were from Germany.\
  \ Both pleasant enough profiles, nothing really for us to decide on but we were\
  \ given the choice. We chose the one on the right.\n\nA week before school started\
  \ we made the two hour drive to the big city of Omaha and met Thomas at the airport.\
  \ His first impression of our vehicle was absolutely priceless. Thomas\u2019s jaw\
  \ dropped as we lifted his bags into the back of our ford F-350, he was flabbergasted.\
  \ \u201CI have never been in a car so big!\u201D he exclaimed. His English was amazing.\
  \ We exited the city via I-80 and headed for our own patch of rural \u201C...Good\
  \ Life.\u201D One of the first things I did was showed off my car, again leaving\
  \ him bemused that I, at 16, had a car. \n\nThomas was a hit at school, everyone\
  \ enjoyed a conversation with him, he even took a pretty girl to prom. At home though\
  \ is where I got to know him. Things like riding go-karts and shooting .22s and\
  \ swimming ponds made our place like an amusement park. \n\nWe also worked very\
  \ hard together. Running a farm with mom and a couple kids means everyone pitches\
  \ in. Moving irrigation pipe in the midday sun, high 90\u2019s temp and humidity,\
  \ he never complained. We could give Thomas a truck load of firewood to split and\
  \ he would not bear the least hint of a grimace on his face. \n\nWhen Thomas left\
  \ it was sad but we knew how crazy happy he was going to be to get home, we took\
  \ it as consolation for saying goodbye to our friend. \n\nIn 2012 I was flying home\
  \ from Qatar and we had a stop over at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. I walked to the\
  \ gate and found Thomas in a black leather jacket leaning on his car. I was impressed\
  \ by his first car. I was flying out early but we had time for some fun so he took\
  \ me into town for an evening that was satisfyingly saturated with great conversation,\
  \ food, and drink. When we parted ways he left me with a bottle of peach brandy\
  \ his grandfather had made. Our parting toast was followed with silent mutual respect\
  \ and a quick awkward guy hug. \n\nKnowing people, really knowing people, from somewhere\
  \ else is part of what crafted me into the person I am now. Getting to know Germany\
  \ with a local, even though it was only for a night, is another such experience\
  \ I will never forget."
