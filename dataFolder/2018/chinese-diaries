Text: "It\u2019s been already one year since I came back from China. And no matter\
  \ how weird it may sound, I still don\u2019t know how to define this experience.\
  \ \n\nWhen I decided to apply for the program that would send me for an academic\
  \ semester in China, I hadn\u2019t exactly realized where I was going. Everything\
  \ was triggered by a simple desire to go somewhere far away, to live something completely\
  \ different from what I had already experienced. \n\nEven though I had in my mind\
  \ that I was heading to an Asian country where people have different characteristics\
  \ from those I have been accustomed to and where the language is composed of ideograms,\
  \ I certainly did not have in mind that I would 'land' in a place where I would\
  \ see everywhere thousands of Asians, that is, people with slanted eyes, black hair,\
  \ porcelain skin and a teenager\u2019s stature. As well, I did not have in mind\
  \ that I could not understand any of the ideograms I would come across. Beyond the\
  \ fact that among the billions of the Chinese population, the non-Asians are few,\
  \ the ideograms for a western culture person look more like a painting than a language.\n\
  \nAnd somehow like that, during my first days in China, I found myself wondering\
  \ around Hangzhou, the city I lived in, having the impression of being an external\
  \ observer, of not being part of this strange society. I was feeling like I was\
  \ in a parallel universe, where nobody could speak English, where I could not eat,\
  \ because I couldn\u2019t order in Chinese, where I couldn\u2019t see sun and sky,\
  \ but something that reminded me of clouds, but Chinese called it \"smog\" and where\
  \ people wore oxygen masks as if they were some sort of accessory: pink masks, black\
  \ masks, blue masks, masks with patterns...\n\nBut, maybe, I was just overreacting,\
  \ because I expected all the other people to look like me. And all the cultures\
  \ to be the same with mine. And every person in the world to celebrate Christmas\
  \ and New Year\u2019s Day (as if they were all Christians or Western civilization\u2019\
  s citizens). \n\nAnd somehow like that, I lived my small, different, exciting, intriguing\
  \ story that was a bit like a movie. A movie consisted of smaller, interesting stories\
  \ that all together make a unique series of events. It was not the classical, happy\
  \ ending story with the beautiful girl and her prince. It was the story of a girl\
  \ (a grown up girl), who an October morning \u2018was landed\u2019 in Hangzhou,\
  \ in order to \u2018open her wings\u2019 and 'discover' her place in this strange\
  \ world called China..."
