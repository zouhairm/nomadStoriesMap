Text: "Over December break the country I decided to set my sites in was Italy. I knew\
  \ I wanted to eat as much pizza and pasta as humanly possible, have my Lizzie McGuire\
  \ moment at the Trevi Fountain, and ofcourse see the Colosseum. You know, the usual\
  \ touristy wishes one has when traveling to Italy. However, what I found in the\
  \ beautiful city\u2019s of Rome and Venice far serpassed my expectations of what\
  \ I originally had in mind. Both city\u2019s, though vastly different, were both\
  \ equally beautiful and intriguing. When in Rome, if you just set aside your itinerary\
  \ and walk the winding streets you are sure to run into random ruins and beautiful\
  \ little coffee shops that serve up the perfect cups if coffee. Venice is a bit\
  \ more tricky. This city is more like a maze. The alley ways are lined with old\
  \ buildings and connected by bridges which run over the canals that allow the gondoliers\
  \ to pass through. In each city I found myself setting down my planner and allowing\
  \ myself to get lost, which is something I vertically never do, I am a planner at\
  \ heart. So, Italy will forever hold a place in my heart, not only because of its\
  \ beauty, delicious food, and abundant history, but also because of its ability\
  \ to let me wander and explore without having to follow a strict schedule and map."
