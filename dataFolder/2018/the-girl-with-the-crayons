Text: "To truly understand kindness, perhaps we would all do well to look into the\
  \ eyes of a child. What more than to look into the eyes of a child who has suffered\
  \ so much. Who yet in a single moment, with one action, can break all perceptions\
  \ of man you\u2019ve ever known to be true. It was the last thing I had expected\
  \ to see, a gesture so small, but yet so big. On a mission to restore hope to an\
  \ impoverished nation; it was me who found hope; faith in the connection between\
  \ man. Because the truth is if you take hope out of life, you do not have hope at\
  \ all. \n\nAs tears streamed her face, she had once again lost the thing that meant\
  \ most to her. She scrambled across the ground, knees battered and bruised searching\
  \ for the crayons, with a gasp of disappointment and sob of despair, they were nowhere\
  \ to be found. In a moment of personal tragedy; a desperate plea for help, she looked\
  \ up and there was the girl with the crayons. Her dark brown eyes a lit, you could\
  \ feel the depth of her insightful empathy, the face of an angel her selfless mercy\
  \ was evident. She kneeled down and without a thought opened her hand giving the\
  \ young weeping girl in the dirt, not one, but all of her crayons. \n\nAs the crying\
  \ girl took the crayons, she rose from the dirt; a new spirit, a resurrected soul.\
  \ A grin suddenly appeared on her face stretching ear to ear, joy had been restored\
  \ as she ran off in delight. The girl with the crayons then took my hand and climbed\
  \ up into my arms, laying her head to rest on my shoulder and quickly falling into\
  \ a deep slumber. There she rested for the remainder of the afternoon. Her head\
  \ nestled into my neck the stiffness and discomfort became insouciant, as the realisation\
  \ set in that I had become her safe haven. \n\nThe children of Heaven Homes know\
  \ what it is to suffer after their villages were tormented by Ebola, they stand\
  \ the only survivors of this broken land. In a place haunted by a loss, how is it\
  \ that the face of its victims can be so full of hope? Her smile captivating, her\
  \ charm contagious, her benevolence breath-taking. To give a child a crayon would\
  \ seem a simple gesture. But when a crayon is all you have left, your only possession,\
  \ what would it take for you to open your hand and give up that crayon to a friend\
  \ who had lost hers playing in the dry dirt and mangroves? It was the girl with\
  \ the crayons whose altruistic grace reminded me what it is to truly love another.\
  \  It is the girl with the crayons who imprinted a memory I will never forget."
