Text: "It's often the fleeting interactions that stick with you.\nWhen I travelled\
  \ on the Isle of Skye, I hitchhiked for the first time. I\u2019d randomly picked\
  \ a day trip and (when the bike hire guy didn\u2019t show up) started off down a\
  \ narrow and very long road.\nIt was me and my green day pack under the sky in Scotland,\
  \ the Cullin range keeping me company on the horizon. I was pretending I\u2019d\
  \ make it on foot.\nBut when I heard an engine I stuck out my thumb.\nIt just happened.\
  \ I was shocked with myself.\nA tiny woman in a huge truck pulled over. She had\
  \ silvery hair, a brisk voice and was sitting on the wrong side - an American truck\
  \ on a one-lane Scottish road. She didn't exactly smile at me, but when I hesitated\
  \ there was a warmth in her voice as she said, \"I know what it\u2019s like to hitch.\"\
  \nI took a deep breath, and got in. She could see I was nervous, so she started\
  \ talking.\nI think it was her that made me first realise how there are truly different\
  \ models for living life. She was Swiss. About 4 years earlier, in a well-paid city\
  \ job, she\u2019d realised she felt disconnected with the hustle and anonymity of\
  \ her life. So she quit, in her late 30s, quit everything with no plans. She stumbled\
  \ on to Skye and, in its slow pace of life and friendly residents, felt connected.\n\
  She worked as a cleaner now, and that was fine. She got to live where she loved.\
  \ The truck was new \u2013 before, she\u2019d relied on rides from locals herself\
  \ o get from house to house across the island.\nShe paused at the end, glanced at\
  \ my quiet face, then told me I wasn't going to Suishnish. There was nothing there.\n\
  She took me to Elgol instead, left off by the pier so I could catch a ferry to a\
  \ lake set in a valley with walls so steep it was only accessible by sea. I jumped\
  \ out and looked at the steely water, the steep slopes of the hills dropping into\
  \ their own reflections. I could see the ghosts of other islands across the bay,\
  \ kelp whirling against their pier in the waves. A seal's head broke the surface\
  \ for a moment then vanished.\nLoch Coruisk was more my sort of thing, she said.\
  \ Turned out she was right, whatever it was she could tell about me.\nShe drove\
  \ away.\nI thought about it, waiting for the ferry, counting the dregs of my bank\
  \ balance in my head. Giving up a comfortable career to travel, then to just be\
  \ somewhere you felt connected with yourself and the world. Financial insecurity.\n\
  But she looked so content, dropping me off at the pier, heading away in her big\
  \ truck."
