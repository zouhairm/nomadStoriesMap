Text: "Dark eyes stare unblinking back into mine. My breath slow and deep, matching\
  \ his. I felt him seeing deep into my soul; my fears, every journey, every need.\
  \ My emotions threaten to surface. Smooth dark hands sooth water over my forehead,\
  \ I close my eyes, holding my face upward. His open hands trace my cheeks, across\
  \ my exposed shoulders and down my arms. I open my eyes as he shifts his attention,\
  \ looking out toward the lily filled billabong.\n\nI glance at his black skin stretched\
  \ across his bare chest. The scars below his throat, signs of tribal initiation.\
  \ He was once a warrior, now an elder, with contrasting grey hair, silver streaks\
  \ of wisdom. In a native tongue, he calls out to the spirits of the land, tiny hairs\
  \ on the back of my neck stand up. My gaze follows the sound of his voice.\n\nPurple\
  \ and mauve waterlilies bob in the breeze, on green mats floating on the water in\
  \ front of us. To the far side of the lagoon, brolgas, elegant dancing cranes ignore\
  \ us, showing off to one another, deep sounds like a digeridoo. I drink in the view\
  \ of the vast floodplains, wetlands with rich grass and grazing buffalo, tiny black\
  \ dots on the horizon. The distant ranges rise to the sky, the shape of a giant\
  \ sleeping serpent.\n\nMy tears mix with the water on my cheeks, anointing me. Relief\
  \ surged through my body, unknown sadness replaced with a force of life I didn't\
  \ know was missing. I felt my libido for life awaken inside me, I was turned on,\
  \ plugged in, connected to powerful energy in this outdoor cathedral, this sacred\
  \ land. \n\nI became aware that I was being watched, I look over at my guide, his\
  \ smile beaming. Without a word, we seem to speak.\n\nThis is sacred Australian\
  \ Aboriginal land, a country marinated in superstition, a land of myth, legend and\
  \ ceremony. A 'blessing' is a cultural necessity.\n\nBy the flickering fire light,\
  \ long after the sun made way for the stars, my guides share stories of creation,\
  \ dreamtime and how everything and everyone is connected.\n\nAgain, my body covers\
  \ with gooseflesh with a rush of recognition. Stories told throughout the world\
  \ share a commonality, a similarity that goes beyond reason. Transcending religions\
  \ and culture, geography and time, the story of oneness connecting us all.\n\nThis\
  \ is my story, this is your story - this is OUR story."
