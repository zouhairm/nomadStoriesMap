Text: "This is not a typical travel story about wild and exotic travel destinations\
  \ or far-flung adventures. In fact, this story takes place in a city that would\
  \ currently not even make it into the Top 100 cities for the next short trip. Dresden,\
  \ the Eastern German town that I called my home for the past four years, is a city\
  \ that many associate with heavy bombings during World War Two, the former DDR regime\
  \ and more recently, with far right agitation. \n\nIt is not an obvious choice for\
  \ waxing lyrical in a travelogue and, for a while at least, it wasn\u2019t even\
  \ somewhere I felt particularly happy. I had just handed in my final college paper\
  \ and, after a week of recovery (spent replenishing my fridge, reviving social media\
  \ accounts, and decorating my tiny one-room flat), loneliness and anxiety started\
  \ to creep up on me like an old and unwelcome ghost from my past. During my busy\
  \ but carefree college years, I had never taken the time think about what steps\
  \ to take after graduation. Seeing each and every one of my close friends leave\
  \ and move on to more interesting projects and places, the fear of missing out on\
  \ opportunities and adventures started to grip me like a vice. Though I was still\
  \ living in the city I had chosen to live in for its burgeoning creative community\
  \ and vibrant student scene, I suddenly felt like the leftovers from the day before\
  \ - with an uneventful summer ahead of me. \n\nIt was when I signed up for art class\
  \ and started to explore the city with pencils, that I noticed the Moon Palace Hostel\
  \ and without further ado asked for a summer job. Mysteriously, you only seem to\
  \ notice hostels when you go travelling - unaware of the opportunity to connect\
  \ with the guests who visit your city. During my first shift serving breakfast,\
  \ I met Agata, the hippie Polish cook with green hair and mermaid leggings, Victoria\
  \ a bold Argentinian photographer on sabbatical and Bavarian Lucie who had initially\
  \ travelled to Dresden for a woodworking contest. We could not have been more different\
  \ at character, but early morning shifts, broken breakfast plates and a mutual sense\
  \ of loneliness drew us together.\n\nOn our first day off, the four of us spent\
  \ the afternoon at a nearby lake - Agata practicing her hula hoop skills, Lucie\
  \ painting a henna tattoo on my ankle and Victoria plugging in a new film spool\
  \ in her analogue camera. We knew that this was the beginning of an unforgettable\
  \ summer, reminding me of the quote of Into the Wild: \"Happiness is only real when\
  \ shared\"."
