Text: "We are sitting back to back, sharing a sandwich I picked up from a stand a\
  \ few feet away. It\u2019s early and the city is beginning to come alive with locals\
  \ and tourists alike. We are sitting in silence and it is the most peace I have\
  \ felt since arriving here. His name is Kim; a Cambodian native I met the day prior\
  \ at a local street market. After discussing our love for literature and food, I\
  \ agreed to let him show me around Phnom Penh and be my personal guide into its\
  \ dark past.\nWe finished our sandwiches and headed towards The Killing Fields.\
  \ We chatted back and forth about the heaviness that clung to Cambodia like a residual\
  \ plague. \u201CAnyone you see over the age of 45 has lived through a nightmare.\u201D\
  \ He explains.\nAs the day progressed, I learned all about the history of Cambodia:\
  \ the wars, the bodies, the regime, the families torn apart. I walked through fields\
  \ of bones and museums full of stories and blood-shed; each room weighing heavier\
  \ on my chest than the last. I stood in open fields with mass graves under my feet\
  \ and felt as if I was suffocating beneath clouds of smoke. \nAs an empath, I felt\
  \ the energy consume me. Pain, anger, and confusion crashed into me like waves with\
  \ stories to tell. I broke down. I left the S-21 Museum from building C and sauntered\
  \ my way towards Kim. I apologized to the fallen for not being strong enough to\
  \ read their stories. \nI cried in the back of his tuk-tuk and as he squeezed his\
  \ hand on my shoulder, he said, \u201CNow, I show you something.\u201D \nThankful\
  \ for the loudness of the tuk-tuk to muffle my embarrassing sobs, we pressed on.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t long before we arrived in a neighborhood. Around us, children kicked\
  \ a ball back and forth and stopped to laugh long enough for the dust to settle\
  \ back into the Earth. Women hung laundry on clothes lines. He turned and gave me\
  \ a warm smile. \u201CWhere are we?\u201D I asked. \u201CThis is my home.\u201D\
  \ He said. \u201CIt isn\u2019t much, but we are happy. We are moving forward. While\
  \ our past is dark and full of great sadness, we are still here.  While we may not\
  \ have money, we are free of war. Our children can play in the streets. My wife\
  \ can watch over our kids and I can work to provide for them. Today, I show you\
  \ what Cambodia was. Now, I show you what Cambodia is. Let\u2019s eat.\u201D \n\
  A young boy came to greet him and they talked back and forth in Khmer. The sun was\
  \ setting, the heaviness had lifted, and I walked into his home with an empty stomach\
  \ and a softness for the Khmer culture and for the warrior that stood before me."
