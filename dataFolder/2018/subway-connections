Text: "Late summer air hung still around the crowded bodies standing over me. I somehow\
  \ managed to quickly take a seat next to my friend as we rode on a packed, Manhattan-bound,\
  \ A train from Brooklyn. Laughter erupted from the group next to us. They were covered\
  \ in colorful face paint, holding various Caribbean flags while some wrapped themselves\
  \ in the fabric to clothe their shirtless bodies. Across the way, children were\
  \ fast asleep on their parents\u2019 shoulders with bedtimes extended well into\
  \ the night while next to them, a couple of young women freshened their complexions\
  \ for their night had just begun. \n\nFor a second, I thought back to my time as\
  \ an outsider looking out at the softened Manhattan skyline through airport windows\
  \ with sincere intimidation. Preconceived notions had steered me clear of cities.\
  \ I had grown weary of society and its daily events of hated and intolerance, so\
  \ I sought comfort in solitude, in nature and in the undisturbed, thinking they\
  \ were the only places a person's mind could heal. Yet here I was: in a restless\
  \ city animated by 8.5 million individual representations of ideas, beliefs, and\
  \ cultures coming together like a colorful mosaic across its five boroughs. My heart\
  \ yearned to reconnect with something real which I believe led me straight to this\
  \ city.\n\nMy mornings began with early commutes from the 125th Street station in\
  \ Harlem to wherever my heart felt like pursuing its quest. Days began and ended\
  \ sitting next to humans from all walks of life. I watched overworked strangers\
  \ willing to give up their seats, while others were too tired themselves to care.\
  \ Once in the subway, it didn\u2019t matter where our days had taken us. We were\
  \ here, in this unpredictable environment, sharing these bizarre, amusing, or silent\
  \ moments. We were all equals on this ride that was taking us to the same location.\
  \ I could easily recognize a stranger\u2019s struggles and I could feel them acknowledging\
  \ mine. The subway lighted a sense of community that I\u2019ve never in my life\
  \ experienced. Humanity began to inspire me again and my heart rejoiced in the solidarity\
  \ I shared with the people beneath this city.\n\nTrack vibrations shook me right\
  \ into a conversation my friend had started back on that noisy A train. Our discussion\
  \ attracts the attention of a friendly, bearded man and we gladly get his opinions\
  \ on our heated Game of Thrones debate which has us laughing until our stop at Washington\
  \ Sq. station. Another simple end to an extraordinary day in New York City."
