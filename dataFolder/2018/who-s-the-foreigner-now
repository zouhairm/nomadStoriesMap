Text: "Before going into the significance of the question in the title of this story,\
  \ let me take you back a few days.There was a long weekend coming up and after doing\
  \ my research and asking around, I decided on a small town in the northern state\
  \ of Uttarakhand. This place was called \u201CRishikesh\u201D.Before leaving for\
  \ Rishikesh, I got in touch with a travel company that arranged tours and retreats\
  \ and one of the items on their agenda was white water rafting. Soon I met up with\
  \ the company that had arranged a small bus to help with the transportation to the\
  \ river. We arrived at our destination and a few meters away from us near the riverbed,\
  \ I saw a line of inflatable river rafts. As I sat in my place on a raft, this young\
  \ foreigner, sat on the raft. Must have been a tourist. I looked into the clear\
  \ river and suddenly heard a voice.\n\u201CAttention travelers! Welcome to the Dreamliner\
  \ and I\u2019m your captain, Derek. I will be in charge of this vessel for the duration\
  \ of this trip and you are all my responsibility.\u201D \nIt was the foreigner,\
  \ and he was standing on the far end of the boat, standing tall with a beaming smile.\
  \ He made everyone comfortable, made sure all safety precautions were taken and\
  \ properly instructed us on our rowing techniques. Soon we were off on the river\
  \ and Derek began to talk about disturbances(called \"drafts\") in the river. Once\
  \ we came close to a draft, we had to hold tight to our oars and keep rowing, harder\
  \ and faster. After an hour of strenuous rafting, we reached an area that looked\
  \ like a campsite and all the rafters parked their boats near the riverbed for a\
  \ quick break. I decided I\u2019d do some exploring and saw there were some naturally\
  \ made paths into the green mountains from where we were sitting. I made sure I\
  \ didn\u2019t go too far in case I got lost. I kept walking along the trail but\
  \ I became so engrossed in the wild that I lost track of the trail.I started calling\
  \ out for help and as I kept running, I fell and felt a stinging sensation on my\
  \ leg. From a sting, it became a burn and I had no idea what it was. I sat up and\
  \ examined my leg and saw it was a bit red. \n\"You've been stung by a nettle plant\"\
  . \nIt was Derek. Apparently, he followed me to make sure I was okay. And he was\
  \ no foreigner to this place- he had been living here for the past 25 years. \n\
  After applying some ointment on my leg, he looked at me and politely asked-\n\"\
  Who's the foreigner now?\"\n\n(Please excuse the lack of flow in the story. I had\
  \ to cut it short by 11,000 characters)"
