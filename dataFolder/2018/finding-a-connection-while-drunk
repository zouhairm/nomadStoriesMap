Text: "It was a 40 hours journey to my temporarily new home, a route that included\
  \ two airplanes, one bus and two taxis. I left Bras\xEDlia on a Friday night and\
  \ two days and 3.7 thousand km later, I was standing in front of a three-floor old\
  \ building, close to the tourist center of Cuzco, in Peru. There was where my adventure\
  \ started: through the Worldpackers volunteer program, for 40 days, I would work\
  \ as a bartender in a hostel four days per week in exchange for a bed and two daily\
  \ meals, a deal that saved me more than US$ 900.\n\nIn order to that, I had to leave\
  \ behind a well-paid internship and a jealous boyfriend (ex by the time I went).\
  \ My main goal was to learn Spanish and to try something new and unexpected (even\
  \ though I wasn\u2019t sure what that would be). When I arrived, my new boss Tete,\
  \ a relaxed and young Argentinian, said I could take the day off to get some rest\
  \ but that I should be at the bar around 10 p.m. because the staff would go out\
  \ together.\n\nAfter a nap, a shower and my makeup routine, I was ready and excited\
  \ to discover Cuzco\u2019s nightlife and to meet my coworkers. At the time, the\
  \ group consisted on two Brazilian girls, an Argentinian guy, an American couple,\
  \ an Australian man and a Danish guy, plus Tete. We all hanged out and drank beers\
  \ until we decided to go to a club named Chango, in the main square of the city.\
  \ When we got there everyone was a little bit tipsy. Because we worked at the hostel,\
  \ we all got free drinks. It\u2019s safe to say that soon enough I was drunk and\
  \ dancing like no one was watching.\n\nEven with my blurry drunk vision, I spotted\
  \ a handsome guy nearby the place that we were at. He was tall and had impressive\
  \ green eyes. He approached me very nicely and introduced himself as Martin. He\
  \ told me he was Peruvian and studied anthropology. We talked all night long, as\
  \ if we were old friends reunited, without having to try hard, something that had\
  \ never happened to me. \n\nWhen my coworkers decided to leave I joined them, even\
  \ not wanting to, because I still didn\u2019t know my way back to the hostel. Martin\
  \ got my phone number and texted me soon after we said our goodbyes. A few hours\
  \ later we would be together again and then everyday afterwards until the one that\
  \ I left. I never really know what to expect when going on an adventure, but the\
  \ last thing I imagined was to quickly fall in love. Even less to get my heart broken.\
  \ But that is a story for another time."
