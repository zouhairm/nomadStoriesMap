Text: "The only difference between the real and the imaginal realm is belief. In our\
  \ imagination we can create anything to be true. We believe we can fly, that our\
  \ human experience is limitless. In reality, words like 'impossible' tend to frequent\
  \ our vocabulary.  I have chosen the pathless woods, and here I have chosen to blaze\
  \ my own trail and find the place where I can create with boundless possibility.\
  \ \nOne morning I am scrambling to fit breakfast into my routine before I take off\
  \ for work. The next morning I am in my hammock on the playa in Uvita, a quaint\
  \ pueblo located on the southern pacific coast of Costa Rica. My curls were unkempt\
  \ with particles of sand and salt, and sea crabs were scampering back to their little\
  \ holes dug out in the sand. Wooden baskets of fruit hung from the tops of palm\
  \ trees as safekeeping from small animals. There was a massive celebration happening\
  \ just over the brush of trees, and some friends and I decided to create a camp\
  \ close to shore called \"Shanti Village\". Our days were filled with making decadent\
  \ jungle cakes out of cacao, dancing around bonfires to the rhythms of drum and\
  \ flute, and running wild into the ocean, sunkissed and free. Little did we all\
  \ know that our journey had just begun, for there was a mission that called for\
  \ our attention...\nOne afternoon, a young man found his way to our camp. He had\
  \ clay all over his body and shells that adorned his knotted hair. \"I was told\
  \ that there is a Rainbow Gathering to be had in Pavones, and you are the ones who\
  \ must create it. It is tradition, and there is no one else who is able to seed\
  \ The Gathering,\" he said with an acute look on his face. \"Well. That settles\
  \ that,\" we decide. \"We must fulfill this prophecy.\" And so it begins.\nWe pack\
  \ up Shanti Village and all seven of us head south to Pavones in a big caravan with\
  \ a van that we called The White Buffalo. Upon our arrival we were greeted by a\
  \ farmer and his son who invited all of us to stay on their property. It was acres\
  \ of jungle filled with biodiversity and a river that flowed for miles into the\
  \ ocean. After one eve of spending the night, we all shared a dream. This was the\
  \ place. \nThe farmer and his son were delighted to have us and agreed to allow\
  \ for The Rainbow Gathering to take place. For two weeks we toiled, gathering stones\
  \ and clearing out fields for campsites. By the full moon, hundreds of people gathered\
  \ to celebrate exuberantly. We all had forged ahead in the pathless woods to find\
  \ ourselves on The Red Road."
