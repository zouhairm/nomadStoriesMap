Text: "The last thing I never expected was that still miss me a lot the huge and boundless\
  \ country. It happens to me, that I'm Italian, and I use to live between narrow\
  \ streets and buildings that clutter too much with them superb history, art and\
  \ poetry; all of that \n even now makes me claustrophobic.\n\nI spent only one year\
  \ of my life in that foreign land. Still, sometimes I'm suffering still that sense\
  \ of claustrophobia, which I was able to win there, on that place so big as so empty.\n\
  \n I remember that Jeep and the possibility to raise my nose to the sky every time\
  \ I wanted it, I always raised the nose because it is not true that \"we are all\
  \ under the same sky\", the sky is different, the sky changes, the sky reflects\
  \ as a mirror the country that hosts it. And that sky seemed so far away, unattainable\
  \ and I was never able to see that boundary line that usually joins the sky with\
  \ the earth.\n\nAnd then those expanses of land stark, cold, wild and cruel, just\
  \ capable of welcoming refineries and equally powerful hostile, strong and solitary\
  \ animals. I have never seen so much sweetness and peace in the eyes as in those\
  \ noble and primitive creatures.\n\nEvery early morning, I couldn't wait that  much\
  \ the curtain of the garage, opens up; it was separated me from millions of deceptive\
  \ crystal grains that shone in the darkness and then slowly dissolved  in something\
  \ else. I had never seen such a snow, the real one,the one that doesn't leave you\
  \ alone in just a day.\n\nSo yeah, I never thought that Canada would knocking in\
  \ my heart and find a place to reside forever."
