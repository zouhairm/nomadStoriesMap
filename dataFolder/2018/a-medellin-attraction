Text: "It was a four-hour ride from Puerto Triunfo to Medellin through beautiful Colombian\
  \ countryside. He had stayed the night at Puerto Triunfo, half way between Bogota\
  \ and Medellin, so he could visit Hacienda N\xE1poles, the erstwhile estate of the\
  \ infamous drug lord. Rohan checked out at quarter to six, hoping to catch the sunrise\
  \ at the Magdalena River, before making his way to Medellin. It had become a tradition;\
  \ relishing in the early shades of orange, wherever he went. Shortly after, he got\
  \ on to his rented motorcycle and made his way to Medellin. \n\nHe checked in and\
  \ headed to the tiny cafe he had crossed on his way up. It was an adorable cafe,\
  \ overlooking the city, just at the corner of the hill. He walked in and realised\
  \ that there was no one else there. Perhaps 9am was early for Medellin, he quipped\
  \ to himself. Armed with his obscurely adequate Spanish, he walked up to the counter.\n\
  \n'Un cafe, por favor.' He noticed how his request puzzled her and he wondered if\
  \ he had said something wrong.\n\nGabriela looked up from her register startled\
  \ by the familiarity of tone from a rather peculiar accent. She looked up, perusing,\
  \ as if trying to gauge his heritage and origins with just her inquisitive stare.\
  \ She was undisputedly perplexed. Chiseled face, wide shoulders and a distinct shade\
  \ of caramel, he could pass off as Mexican. She had met many Mexicans over the years\
  \ though and his accent was anything but Mexican. Yet, there was something charming\
  \ about his voice, something musical. \n\n'Sure. Would you like anything else?'\n\
  'No. gracias. How much is that?'\n'800 pesos, por favor. Could I ask you something\
  \ if you don't mind?'\n'Sure.'\n'You don't sound like you're from here?'\n'Si, I\
  \ am from India' he responded, a sentence he had practiced and used many a time\
  \ before.\n'That's lovely, are you liking it here?'\n'Yes I am, I've just ridden\
  \ from Puerto Triunfo. Your country is beautiful.'\n'Your Spanish is really good'\n\
  'Thankyou. Here you go, keep the change.' \n\nGabriela smiled at him. Rohan wanted\
  \ to keep the conversation going, but his skills of the language had been hindered\
  \ by his inability to talk to a gorgeous woman. \n\n'There's a club not far from\
  \ here. My friends and I are going there tonight. You should come.' she said, passing\
  \ him the coffee.\n'That does sound tempting.'\n'It'll be fun. You'll see what real\
  \ Colombian hospitality is like.'\n'Sure, why not?'\n'I'm Gabriela.'\n'I'm Rohan,\
  \ nice to meet you Gabriela.' This is turning out to be a great day he thought to\
  \ himself."
