Text: "If Paraty were a woman, it would be some sort of beauty queen, soccer team\
  \ muse or any beauty title worth it, because of its enormous prettiness. Brunette\
  \ with emerald-green eyes - which are its sea. Long hair, plentiful and vigorous\
  \ - which is its forest genuinely Atlantic. Dazzling curves of its islands, stones\
  \ and waterfalls. An authentic Brazilian beauty.\nThe mysterious city is rich in\
  \ legends, like the one with the dragon, whose head was buried where the main town\
  \ church is located, and whose tail is found deep in the city's water channel. Or\
  \ the one with the thirsty bride, seen by her groom after being dead, drinking water\
  \ at the port's fountain. According to the legend, when her distressed fianc\xE9\
  \ asked to dig up her body, it was found completely turned over with scratch marks\
  \ all over the casket.\nThe inn that hosted and my mom, the perfect travel companion,\
  \ was located at the top of a hill. So we decided to take our daily climbing as\
  \ an act of penance and an exercise to thicken our cabs. One day we climbed that\
  \ hill four times. As I did it, I kept cursing a friend who proposed I should stay\
  \ there and promising I would get even. Paraty nighs were inebriating, as jazz bands\
  \ kept playing in each corner. It was one huge party.\nThus, to celebrate a remarkable\
  \ trip, when we were about to leave we took one last tour. We chose a light and\
  \ speedy boat to go to some fabulous islands nearby. But in the recondite corner\
  \ of my soul lied a certain fear of things going the wrong way while the arrival\
  \ home was so close. I went anyway, defying that feeling and filled with a gut that\
  \ moves us when traveling.\nStill at the port, the weather closed. A sailor who\
  \ tried to sell me some boat ride cursed me for choosing another boat, affirming:\
  \ \"one hour until it rains. A lot.\" As we started our tour, the rain came, persistently,\
  \ and wet all our things. I looked up and saw an airplane in the sky, but I soon\
  \ forgot about it. It was impossible to stop by the islands for a swim - there were\
  \ tons of lightning! We decided to go back to solid ground. And then, we saw what\
  \ appeared to be a sunken ship, only to find out it was that airplane that had crashed.\
  \ Heavy silence and sadness. A feeling of impotence. The people inside the plane\
  \ died. One of them was a minister of the Supreme Court - Teori Zavascki.\nOnce\
  \ more the thought that death has no capacity to alter the circle of life arises.\
  \ And the lady called Paraty continued exuberant in its beauty, charm, mystery and\
  \ joy."
