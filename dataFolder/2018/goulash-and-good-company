Text: "I had been traveling for two weeks: Boston to London, London to Madrid, Madrid\
  \ to Milan, Milan to Florence, Florence to Dubrovnik. \n\nIn London I missed my\
  \ train by minutes; in Madrid my taxi wound through the streets, raising the fare\
  \ until it was almost double what I expected; in Milan a man forced pigeon food\
  \ into my hand and demanded money for it; in Florence, bed bugs left giant red welts\
  \ on my arms, legs, and neck; on my way to Dubrovnik, the bus driver pulled over\
  \ in the middle of the night, insisting that I had the wrong ticket, and threatening\
  \ to leave me in the street if I didn\u2019t give him 50 Euro.\n  \nAt 4 AM, when\
  \ the bus pulled over at the next rest stop, I looked up flights home. This trip\
  \ was supposed to last three months, but I wasn\u2019t sure how much more of this\
  \ I could take. \n\nI arrived in Dubrovnik and met \u201CMama,\u201D a small Croatian\
  \ woman who ran a hostel with her husband. Upon meeting me she hugged me like one\
  \ of her own children. It took all of my willpower to stop myself from burying my\
  \ head in her shoulder and sobbing.\n\nHours later, I arrived early to dinner, sunburnt\
  \ and content from my day exploring the old city and swimming outside the ancient\
  \ walls. Mama was in the kitchen with an apron on, she seemed happy to see me. \n\
  \nI saw a stack of folded napkins and started placing one in front of each chair.\
  \ She tutted, and pushed me to sit. Whenever I tried to help, to chop onions or\
  \ fill the water pitcher, she silently pushed me down into my seat until I finally\
  \ stayed put. \n\nChastened, I admired the view from the dining room window. A sparkling\
  \ blue bay and red roofs of the old city, all set apart from the lush green mountains.\
  \ When the sun began to lower and the sky turned pink, she started setting the table.\n\
  \nOther travelers staying at the hostel downstairs started to trickle in. We chatted,\
  \ mostly in English, until \u201CPapa\u201D arrived, carrying several bottles of\
  \ amber-colored wine.\n\nThe food was extraordinary. Salad made from the garden,\
  \ hearty goulash with bright green peas, fresh baked bread that was both crunchy\
  \ and soft, lemon cake for dessert. Even the wine was delicious. Papa makes sure\
  \ our glasses stay full throughout the meal.\n\nWhen the sun had completely set\
  \ and the view out the window was nothing but dark blue peppered with yellow lights,\
  \ I excused myself and drunkenly wandered to my bed. \n\nI pulled out my laptop\
  \ to cancel the flights I had started to book for home. Tomorrow morning I leave\
  \ for Athens. I won\u2019t quit now. My adventure is just beginning."
