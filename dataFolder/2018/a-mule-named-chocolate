Text: "\"Would you like to cross the Chihuahuan desert riding a horse?\" \nThere might\
  \ be many questions arising from this invitation as: \"How do these strange ideas\
  \ come to your mind\"? \nBut, my answer was \"yes.\" \nAfter two weeks, with my\
  \ beloved geologist friend, passionate and skillful horse rider, we drive for 12\
  \ hours to the far west. From Houston megalopoli, we find ourselves, among the coyotes,\
  \ at Terlingua, surrounded by ghost towns on the banks of the Rio Grande. \nAdventurous\
  \ spirit? I do not know. I only remember the enthusiasm and the curiosity to find\
  \ something hardly signaled by the maps but above all the feeling of lightheartedness\
  \ leading to an unknown destination. \nAt dawn, we meet our guide Linda, a fifty-year-old\
  \ former rodeo champion. Red hair and sun-aged face, she had moved years back to\
  \ this little village becaming its beating heart. When we asked her, what led her\
  \ to this choice of life she said: \"you will understand it at sunset.\" \nWith\
  \ a stableman, an elder couple and a retired physician, we are going to cross the\
  \ river, delimiting the US-Mexico border, on a tin boat. I pause to observe the\
  \ floating object and for the first time I think I'm reckless. Linda urges us to\
  \ board saying that in the event of sinking, the water is not that deep.\n\"Do you\
  \ know how to ride?\" \n\"Sincerely no,\" is my embarrassed answer. \"Ok then we'll\
  \ give you a mule. He has a flatter back, so it's easier to keep the balance. I\
  \ expect a donkey not much higher than me, and here it is this imposing quadruped,\
  \ named Chocolate, reminding of his wonderful black mantle. \nChocolate is strong\
  \ and patient, he knows the path but he gets nervous when we begin to drive a cliff\
  \ to get to the top of the mesa. My anxiety increases until I realize that Chocolate\
  \ is the first that does not want to slip along the ridge. Sometimes we have no\
  \ other choice than relying on others and destiny. After half an hour of complete\
  \ silence, interrupted by small rocks rolling down to the bottom, we reach the plain\
  \ from which we can enjoy a panorama of a stunning beauty. Thirsty and dehydrated\
  \ by the sun, we sit on the dusty ground. The sunset light enhances the nuances\
  \ of red mesas highlighting the veins. My friend in a soft voice asks me \"How don\u2019\
  t you get excited by the power of the earth? Can you understand how the earth's\
  \ crust has shifted, crossed, dismantled? This vision makes me shiver. \" After\
  \ understanding Linda's choice, we set out to get to our Mexican guide's home on\
  \ the riverside."
