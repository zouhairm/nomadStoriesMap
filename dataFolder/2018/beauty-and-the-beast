Text: "He was an unexpected detour on a tour of the tropical paradise that is the\
  \ stunning south coast of Sri Lanka. \n\nAn unforgettable sight I could have easily\
  \ missed had my attention not been drawn toward the temple grounds in which he stood.\
  \ \n\nHe was clearly distressed, swaying back and forth unable to communicate his\
  \ pain though it radiated from every inch of him. People moved around him, snapping\
  \ photos and fanning themselves against the relentless heat but I was unable to\
  \ take my eyes from him, and unable to ignore the complete juxtaposition he represented\
  \ belonging to the country I had, over the previous week, fallen completely in love\
  \ with. \n\nMy adventures in Sri Lanka began in a beautiful colonial home in the\
  \ heart of Anghama, surrounded by coconut trees and strangers who quickly became\
  \ lifelong friends. \n\nSunshine Stories is a surf and yoga retreat run by a young\
  \ couple with a love of soulful movement and the rare luxury of being able to bring\
  \ their boldest dream to life. It was a beautiful, enriching experience and one\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to end. \n\nEnd it did of course and off I went to explore\
  \ the crystal waters of Hiriketiya, dance Christmas Eve away and trek barefoot in\
  \ search of espresso upon waking with the sun. \n\n\nAs it came time to leave I\
  \ cheerfully squashed my (excessive) backpack into the tuk tuk and felt my excitement\
  \ build for the next part of the adventure. \n\nAs we rounded a bend, I came face\
  \ to face with a statue of Buddha as high as my two-storey home and, because the\
  \ magic of chaotic traffic is mesmerising, quickly flicked my eyes away. \n\nIt\
  \ was then the driver said, \u201Clook elephant\u201D, and I turned my head back\
  \ in surprise. We were in the middle of an urban sprawl with barely a tree in sight,\
  \ how could there be an elephant?\n\nThere were in fact, two. Both unable to move,\
  \ chained by their necks and legs to the only two trees on the temple grounds. \n\
  \nI raced from the tuk tuk to the fence and stood watching him. He swayed in a frenzied\
  \ dance, mad, trapped and terrified. Back and forth, back and forth, as tall as\
  \ ten humans and shackled, with no room to move in any direction. My heart tore\
  \ from my chest as I stared into his wild eyes, tears blurred my eyes and I turned\
  \ on my heel and ran demanding the tuk tuk driver take me away. \n\nAs we sped the\
  \ streets of a country that had broken my heart, I made a silent promise to set\
  \ him free. On that day, our brief connection was, for him, a sliver of light in\
  \ what had no doubt been a lifetime of sadness."
