Text: "Before I met my husband, I was leaving on a hitchhiking journey to every country\
  \ in the world in one month, kicking off an epic travel blog. For him, I paused\
  \ my plans.\n\nFour years later, in July of 2017, we were planning a 6-month stay\
  \ in Mexico with our cat and dog. It was our first out-of-country visit. By February\
  \ 11th of 2018, we had our itinerary, paperwork and 6 months of online Spanish lessons.\
  \ We were on our merry way and we crossed the border on the 13th.\n\nWe quickly\
  \ realized we could hardly speak our online-learned Spanish well enough to pay for\
  \ gas, but we pushed on to our AirBNB cabin in a small town in the middle of Mexico.\
  \ When we arrived, we spent an hour trying to ask for our room and thank our gracious\
  \ host through a thick language barrier. \n\nThe cabin was beautiful, but my husband\
  \ and I were both in the middle of culture shock, riding out the waves of anxiety\
  \ and fear, and we soon noticed that our kitty, Wu, hadn\u2019t recovered from her\
  \ post-car lethargy at all.\n\nWu almost died to a condition known as \u201Cmegacolon\u201D\
  \ when she was 9 weeks old, and she hadn\u2019t used the litterbox since we\u2019\
  d left, despite a dose of laxatives from her vet. She seemed to be shutting down.\n\
  \nWe looked for a local vet and came up empty-handed, so we gave her another pill\
  \ and went to sleep. In the morning, her condition was worse. After an hour of panicked\
  \ research and a talk with her vet, we had a deadline to quickly restore her health\
  \ or lose her.\n\nWe could drive the planned eighteen hours to our next AirBNB or\
  \ drive seven hours back across the border to get her to a vet who was waiting for\
  \ her. \n\nMuch as it pained me, we packed the car and drove back to the United\
  \ States with one trembling, sleepy kitty less than 24 hours after getting our first\
  \ passport stamps.\n\nThe clinic met us that evening and in less than an hour, she\
  \ was no longer in grave danger. The veterinarian told us to take her home to Colorado\
  \ and not travel with her again.\n\nThe next morning, we cried our way home, fearing\
  \ for her and feeling as though we'd failed at our trip at the same time.\n\nFive\
  \ minutes from home in Colorado and Wu was looking better. Meows chimed from the\
  \ back seat and suddenly our beloved kitty seemed okay. As soon as she set foot\
  \ in the house, she pranced straight to her litter box to prove to us that she was\
  \ indeed feeling more like herself.\n\nAs for us? We\u2019re headed back to Mexico\
  \ for attempt number two soon, after recovering our losses from attempt number one."
