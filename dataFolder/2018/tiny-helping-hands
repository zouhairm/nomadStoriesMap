Text: "How do I sneak away from the dinner table and to the bathroom without anyone\
  \ noticing the river of blood flowing from my thumb? Okay, I just need to make sure\
  \ none of this blood gets on the pretty white carpet, maybe I could-\n\n\u201CMama,\
  \ can I take my new Indian friend to get the bread out of the oven? Do Indians eat\
  \ bread?\u201D He\u2019s 7, exactly half my age, and he sticks his tiny white hand\
  \ on my reddish-brown one, carefully placed to conceal my secret and drags me to\
  \ the kitchen before his mother can swallow and respond. Oh, this child is good.\
  \ \n\nIn the kitchen, he gently hands me kitchen roll, and at first I miss his question,\
  \ staring out of the window. It\u2019s like the Alps are falling in, kissing the\
  \ sunny yellow walls like the most beautifully suited lover one could have. He impatiently\
  \ tugs at my hand causing another trickle of blood, and I focus on his face. \u201C\
  You didn\u2019t like the sausage soup? That\u2019s why you were picking at your\
  \ thumb isn\u2019t it?\u201D\n\nThere\u2019s no way he\u2019s seven.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019\
  s a nervous habit. I don\u2019t eat meat, and I have no idea how to tell your mother,\
  \ I hinted at it yesterday but...\u201D \n\nHe rolls his blue little eyes as his\
  \ mother walks in, and then holds my hand supportively, wagging his eyebrows to\
  \ urge me to speak. I push my embarrassed eyes to meet my host mother\u2019s and\
  \ stutter out, \u201CI uh, I don\u2019t eat meat, I\u2019m so sorry I never mentioned\
  \ this before.\u201D\n\n\u201COh, is that all? I was so worried! You should have\
  \ said something!\u201D she says while hugging me. She walks to the side to get\
  \ me some salad and save the bread from the oven as her son chirps out all the plans\
  \ he has to introduce me to Hinterzarten and Germany. He pulls out a notebook, starts\
  \ a list and says, \u201CDon\u2019t worry mama, I\u2019ll take care of her.\u201D\
  \ And that he did, teaching me to ski, explaining what teenagers in the street to\
  \ stay away from, getting me to walk him to school and help with homework and joyously\
  \ introducing me to everyone with \u201CThis is Saba. Saba doesn\u2019t eat meat.\u201D\
  \ \n\nSix months away visiting a foreign country can be daunting, and probably never\
  \ more so than when you\u2019re fourteen and hitting puberty. But when you\u2019\
  re taught to live instead of visit, when you have a tiny guide accepting you as\
  \ family and walking through German life through his pure and loving understanding,\
  \ it ends up feeling like home. My experience of Germany is unlike my experience\
  \ anywhere else - actually falling into a country, living it, breathing it and being\
  \ dragged inside by a tiny little hand."
