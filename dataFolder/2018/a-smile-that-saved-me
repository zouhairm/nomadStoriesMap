Text: "A backpack loaded with clothes, travelling essentials and all the cash I had\
  \ got. Anxious, self-conscious and cautious was the state of mind. It was the beginning\
  \ of my first ever solo travel.\nSince I was a student, I hadn\u2019t enough money\
  \ to book a flight or even sleeper class of the train. So, I decided to go for a\
  \ full desi experience; budget travel and cheap but healthy food.\nI was in general\
  \ coach of the train and it was there I made one of the biggest mistakes \u2013\
  \ the mistake of keeping all the cash in my backpack. Well, I was just being smart.\n\
  The only thing certain about the Indian railways is that their timing is uncertain.\
  \ At night, the train stopped at a station and someone from the crowd said that\
  \ the halt time was more than 20 minutes. So, I kept my backpack in the common drawer\
  \ and took out a couple of notes and left the coach to eat something.\nI felt free\
  \ thinking I had time. I searched but I could not find any food joint nearby, someone\
  \ advised me to go little further. I peeped back to see how far I\u2019ve come and\
  \ felt a little strange inside.\nThe shop, however, came and I bought some snacks.\
  \ Next thing I know the train was moving, it shook me completely, and so I took\
  \ the snacks and ran with all my might. I was far from the train and farthest from\
  \ the coach I was in. The train speeded up and I felt I was going to lose it but\
  \ then I saw a hand from the gates of a sleeper class and I ran well off to catch\
  \ it. Next moment I was sweating, panting and lying on the floor of that coach.\
  \ The guy winked at me and I smiled back clearing the sweat off my face.\nI was\
  \ on the train, relieved but I was still nervous about my backpack. What if someone\
  \ had stolen my bag? I felt trembling inside, I did not know anyone neither had\
  \ I made an acquaintance on the train except that old guy who smilingly moved his\
  \ stuff so that I could place mine.\nI anxiously waited for next station to arrive\
  \ and when it came I ran my ass off to general coach. It only took me seconds to\
  \ reach from where I had left, but the gate from which I had come out was closed.\
  \ I knocked it a couple of times but nobody opened it, this was again a shocker.\
  \ I ran towards the other gate of the coach and found it jam-packed. I somehow made\
  \ my way in and when I reached to the gallery, I could see the other end where the\
  \ common drawer was. I glanced at it but could not see anything and it was then\
  \ my eyes moved a bit and I saw that old man smiling at me, I smiled back and I\
  \ knew I was doing just fine."
