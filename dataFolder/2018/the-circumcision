Text: "\u201CMy boy.\nTo be circumcised.\u201D\n\nThis was the message that I woke\
  \ up to receive on a December morning in 2015, followed by a photo of a boy dressed\
  \ in a glittering white suit. This was almost as out of the blue as it sounds, but\
  \ the story begins when I was backpacking in Turkey three months before.\n\nA friend\
  \ and I were visiting a farmer\u2019s market in Tire, in the western province of\
  \ Izmir, when we met Ali, a local farmer who had just started learning English.\
  \ He showed us around the colourful stalls selling everything from figs to felt\
  \ slippers made by the town\u2019s ke\xE7eci (felt-masters), before insisting that\
  \ we come to his village to try his own produce. We spent the afternoon drinking\
  \ tea in the mulberry-covered village square and eating walnuts with his family.\n\
  \nWe kept in touch, but mostly stuck to topics like the weather or public transport.\
  \ So when the invitation to a \u2018S\xFCnnet\u2019 circumcision ceremony arrived,\
  \ I must confess I was amazed. Ali explained that the nine-year-old boy in the photo\
  \ was his son Eren, and the S\xFCnnet an occasion of dancing and feasting to celebrate\
  \ Eren's transition into manhood.\n\nIn a moment of spontaneous madness, I booked\
  \ my flights and arrived at Izmir airport clutching a pink party dress with little\
  \ idea of what was to come.\nMy nerves were immediately dispelled. Ali\u2019s daughter\
  \ Eyl\xFCl took me by the hand and didn't let go of it all day. Our first stop was\
  \ the ladies\u2019 Kuaf\xF6r, where I was met by relatives smiling and chatting\
  \ as the hairdresser rolled their hair into beautiful curls. \nTo make me feel at\
  \ home, they had switched the TV to the only English channel and we all laughed\
  \ at the universally funny clumsiness of Mr Bean while pink eyeshadow, lipstick\
  \ and foundation were applied to our faces.\n\nEren fastened his fur-trimmed cloak;\
  \ the time had come for the evening festivities. As we entered the village hall\
  \ sparklers shot into the air and the family took their seats on plush red thrones.\
  \ Guests took to the dance floor, men stretching their arms and circling rhythmically\
  \ in the Zeybek folk dance. \u201CLike Eagle\u201D, smiled Ali, gesturing to the\
  \ crowd.\n\nAli asked if I could stay longer and feeling more confident with my\
  \ Turkish, I explained I had to return to work; \u201CHayir, i\u015Fiyorum\u201D\
  . \n\nThree years on, as I prepare for my Turkish GCSE and the family\u2019s first\
  \ visit to England, I now know that \u2018i\u015Fiyorum\u2019 means \u2018I am peeing\u2019\
  . I hope that for our next meeting I can convince my friends that my bladder problem\
  \ as well as my Turkish has improved!"
