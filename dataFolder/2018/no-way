Text: "- No way, this cannot be the address.\n- I told you Madam, this is it, Rue\
  \ Mandakan #175, 48930, Zankud. \n- No way.\n- If you want I can help you with your\
  \ luggage Madam.\n- Yes Sir.\nThe night is falling, and of course the wind has come\
  \ up to greet the arrival. The entrance door looks slightly opened, which gives\
  \ the ambience a less confident flavor. The address might be correct, but for sure\
  \ it isn\u2019t what was decided. \nIf she knew, the lady would have brought her\
  \ comfortable and soft writing clothes. The luggage full of stuff for the meeting\
  \ for water optimization in agriculture projects looks useless surrounded by XIX\
  \ century paintings, sculptures and magnificent galleries. \nThanks to magic, candles\
  \ are progressively giving light and colours to the textures discerned. The whole\
  \ space seems to be abandoned but ready for the arrival. \nSuddenly the phone rings,\
  \ the sound comes from the hall of entrance, where the luggage still waits for the\
  \ settlement. The projects scheduled have been reassigned to the Comfort Audience,\
  \ and they will start working in their own way and with their own money; but they\
  \ ask the lady to be opened and ready for sudden questions they would need from\
  \ her. As egoist as it sounds.\nRue Mandakan, let\u2019s discover it. \nThe night\
  \ has completely conquered the sky, the silence of the road is just interrupted\
  \ by some noises from the factory on top of the hill. \nThe lady needs water and\
  \ she needs food too. \nA matt black pick up appears quietly, the battery doesn\u2019\
  t share any sound, the driver wants to speak, but the verbal language doesn\u2019\
  t easily match between cultures. \nFinally she is able to jump inside, the music\
  \ fom the radio decorates the quiet drive. The young man recognizes the lady, but\
  \ he doesn\u2019t know what to say. She wears skin colours he has never seen; her\
  \ smile looks tired but strongly inspired by kilometers walked. \nHe tries to hide\
  \ his smile when she looks so funny and focused. She is a writer she says. She also\
  \ travels for photography. While she shares some of her thoughts, the car just arrives\
  \ to the factory. The lady looks at the driver completely astonished; it isn\u2019\
  t what she was thinking about when needing water and food groceries. But she ends\
  \ up sitting in the dining room of the factory, surrounded by the energetic workers\
  \ of the night ship. She doesn\u2019t understand the words they say, but quickly\
  \ gets the tone and music of their voices, which is more than enough for her to\
  \ feel warm and strangely loved by those unknown faces."
