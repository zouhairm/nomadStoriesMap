  \ translations: \u201CCAUTION AVALANCHE\u201D and \u201CAttention Climbers!! IF\
  \ YOU GET LOST, DON\u2019T try to go down the mountain!\u201D \n\nSome people wake\
  \ up thinking, \u201CI want to climb Hokkaido\u2019s highest peak.\u201D My fiance\
  \ is one of those people, and I\u2019m the type who says yes before knowing what\
  \ she\u2019s getting into.\n\nWe loaded the tram that ascends 500 meters up Asahidake,\
  \ a peak in the backcountry ski haven that\u2019s Japan\u2019s largest northern\
  \ island. The hollow wind sound offered no comfort at the mid-mountain station.\
  \ Suddenly, I had the nervous poops for the third time that morning. The toilet\
  \ bowl water was already brown from the sulphuric, volcanic activity surrounding\
  \ us. \n\nOutside in the frigid alpine air, patches of blue sky defined a mass of\
  \ white looming over us. I took a deep breath and thought longingly of a steaming\
  \ onsen, beer, and other comforts of civilization that the austere Japanese mountains\
  \ lack. \n\nAt the point where most skied down from the tram, we stuck skins to\
  \ the bottom of our skis to ascend 691 meters. Beacons on, packs buckled, and heel\
  \ risers up, we joined the skin track someone else had already broken. \n\nThe skin\
  \ flew by for about 300 meters as I focused on the cadence of each step, letting\
  \ the skins glide my skis forward. Then the comfort of solid snow dissipated into\
  \ ice and rock.\n\nLike a gangly and awkward fawn, I tried to gain purchase on my\
  \ skis. A steep drop off threatened on the left, and the slope stretched into the\
  \ white abyss on the right. \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s hoof it up from here,\u201D Zeno,\
  \ my fiance, said. \n\nThe gear switch allowed time to scarf down some chocolate\
  \ clusters and a half frozen hard-boiled egg. Zeno pointed out a block of clouds\
  \ that had crept up the mountain. I followed his lead and clicked out of my skis,\
  \ then shoved them into my backpack straps. \n\nToe-kick, toe-kick, toe-kick. My\
  \ neck ached from staring at the ground. I thought of nothing else but how not to\
  \ sail down the mountain. \n\nThe false summit offered five feet of visibility on\
  \ a wide enough ridge to collect oneself. Only the most essential of thoughts passed\
  \ through my conscious. I need more layers. Where\u2019s my helmet? Put on the big\
  \ puffy and mittens. \n\nWe scurried up the last 100 feet and took a selfie. The\
  \ wooden stake marked Hokkaido\u2019s highest point in elegant characters, at 2,291\
  \ meters. I grinned wide at the camera, eyelashes frozen together. Only the present\
  \ moment existed."
