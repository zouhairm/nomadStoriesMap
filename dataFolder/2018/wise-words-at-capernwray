Text: "No matter how I sit, sprawl, or scrunch, my twin bed under the eaves feels\
  \ like it\u2019s shrinking every minute. I can\u2019t get comfortable. I can\u2019\
  t focus. After two and a half weeks of constant travel, I\u2019ve done very little\
  \ but read and befriend a couple of sheep during my three-week stay at the Hogwarts-like\
  \ castle in the north of England, resulting in restless claustrophobia. There\u2019\
  s only a week and a half left before my Oxford Summer Programme literature courses\
  \ start and I have seven more novels to finish. This knowledge and the illusion\
  \ that the low ceiling is getting even closer aren\u2019t helping my focus, so I\
  \ mosey down the stairs to the cafeteria. Maybe some fresh air and coffee will clear\
  \ my head. \u201CGet me sorted,\u201D as my English friends would say. \nA woman\
  \ named Nicky I\u2019d met my first day here sits next to me. She\u2019s talking\
  \ to a few other people at the table about sheep. I suppose this makes sense. There\
  \ are a lot of sheep in the north of England. I sip my coffee and listen as the\
  \ conversation transitions somehow to giraffes in Kenya until a few people finish\
  \ eating and leave the table.\n\u201CYou\u2019ve been to Kenya?\u201D I ask Nicky.\
  \ \n\u201CThree different times. On missions trips.\u201D\n\u201CWhat was your favorite\
  \ experience?\u201D\n\u201COh dear. Let me see!\u201D She laughs and regales me\
  \ with a couple of her adventures before growing quiet; obviously thoughtful. \n\
  \u201CWhat if everybody took a year to do service somewhere they\u2019d never been?\u201D\
  \ She stares wistfully past me.\n\u201CI bet it would do everyone a lotta good,\u201D\
  \ I say, smiling crookedly. I feel sheepish.\nNicky senses my discomfort and looks\
  \ at me. I shake my head. \u201CJust feeling a little privileged all of a sudden.\
  \ I\u2019m studying at Oxford for the rest of the summer.\u201D\nShe smiles warmly.\
  \ \n\u201CWe\u2019re all trees, you see. And sometimes, as we\u2019re growing, especially\
  \ in the beginning, we have to experience things that help us put down strong roots\
  \ before we\u2019re full grown. A spindly tree with no roots can be knocked over\
  \ by a\u2015a sheep that rubs up against it. But if you take the opportunities you\
  \ have to grow your roots, you\u2019ll grow strong. Then, once you have a strong\
  \ trunk, your branches can grow out wide and strong too, providing shelter to others.\
  \ We\u2019re all different, you know. Some grow to be the tall trees that take the\
  \ lightning; some don\u2019t grow very tall but spread their branches out wide;\
  \ and some will always have to be supported by sticks and wires. But for some reason,\
  \ we\u2019re all here.\u201D She covers my hand with hers and winks at me before\
  \ getting up."
