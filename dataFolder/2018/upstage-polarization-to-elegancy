Text: "I a virtuoso backpacker, without Google\u2019s edification went to a city completely\
  \ different from my life in Udaipur to bustle of the city of Nizams, Hyderabad;\
  \ once a diamond trading centre sojourning nature. Hitech City of Hyderabad was\
  \ a roundabout in the technologically flourishing state. 'Dialogue in Dark' a curious\
  \ place to have my lunch at where in I went losing all shiny objects to a locker,\
  \ to enter into a room which was dark & at next door greeted by Mazhar, my host,\
  \ we were to test my senses, he explained me to hold a handrail so I don\u2019t\
  \ tumble in dark. Moving forward he asked me what material is the handrail made\
  \ of, to which I replied Bamboo. After that we exchanged pleasantries & to my amusement\
  \ I found that he is blind. We went over a bamboo bridge where my sense of smell\
  \ was tested by recognizing various herbs to which he commended as I recognized\
  \ them all.After we came in front of a wall where various faces were tactile & to\
  \ recognize who they belonged to, I can be boastful by saying that I did very well\
  \ by guessing correctly. We played cricket in dark , where I was bashed by Mazhar.\
  \ A tending voice of Ankit who served lunch in dark,but what left me perplexed was\
  \ how to pay as I couldn\u2019t guess value of notes to which Ankit rescued me by\
  \ what size of note had what values.\nWhile returning I was on a juncture what I\
  \ wanted to see as I wanted to do something for my soul which was ravished by the\
  \ lunch experience. The next morning I left to enter the nourishing complex of Gurudwara\
  \ Saheb Ameerpet. I went to kitchen to serve people in queues waiting for Parsad\
  \ trying to keep no-one waiting & with a smile. After some time an old lady who\
  \ had been serving alongside me asked to join her & eat as the kitchen will close\
  \ soon. I resisted saying I wanted to serve more people coming in but she was caring\
  \ enough to let me do it.\nShe recognized I wasn\u2019t from Hyderabad in our conversation\
  \ & asked how come I was not seeing the city around. I told about my day before\
  \ & didn\u2019t know how to convene the feelings which led me here, but she understood\
  \ & said \u201CI too come here everyday to feed my son.\u201D I was amused as I\
  \ hadn\u2019t realized she was accompanied by someone so I asked casually \u201D\
  We should ask him as well to join.\u201D She replied \u201CHe is with god now. I\
  \ have fed him well in the queues prior.\" I thought he was in the temple praying\
  \ & absent mindedly asked\u201D What does your son do?\u201D To which she had teary\
  \ eyes, a smile & I realized what she meant by he is with god."
