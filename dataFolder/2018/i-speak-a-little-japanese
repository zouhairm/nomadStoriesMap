Text: "I owe who and what I am to my time spent in Japan 17 years ago. I had just\
  \ graduated, my father had just passed away, and I had left home to spend two years\
  \ in those beautiful and enigmatic islands. My time in Japan was an epiphany, a\
  \ crucible out of which I became, well, me.\_\n\nIt was there that I met an extraordinary\
  \ woman. Kimiko Kobayashi. She ran a small English school, driven by a passion for\
  \ language that she thought would bring cultures together. \n\nWhen she interviewed\
  \ me to teach at her school, I clearly did not fit into her ideal image of an English\
  \ teacher. Perhaps I would have made a better first impression if I had been less\
  \ male and more Caucasian. She wasn\u2019t prejudiced, but she knew what would be\
  \ most appealing to her students. Nevertheless, she took a risk and hired me.\n\n\
  She taught me the language, and opened my eyes to the hidden Japanese world that\
  \ was either inaccessible or so easily overlooked by foreign visitors. She explained\
  \ the culture, driven by her passion to be a bridge between two cultures. She was\
  \ elegantly Japanese, gracious with the occasional faux pas from her gaijin employee,\
  \ gently instructing or gracefully overlooking as required. She introduced me to\
  \ her family, and made me feel part of it.\n\nShe always looked so young to have\
  \ grown-up children, even though she carried herself with the composure and elegance\
  \ of an older woman.\n\nShe sent her son, Sei, to study near me in Brighton. I hoped\
  \ that she would join him, and see the country whose language she had spent her\
  \ life teaching, but had never visited.\n\nOver the years we lost touch, but in\
  \ advance of an upcoming trip to Japan, I tried to contact Sei on messenger. He\
  \ was stalling, the little grey balls flashing. \nHe was mustering his broken English\
  \ trying to phrase one of the hardest things to ever have to commit to words. His\
  \ mother, my friend, had died 3 years ago. In his poignant words, \"she has gone\
  \ to a place where no one of us can reach.\"\n\nThis is written in tribute to Kimiko.\
  \ My sensei in generosity, hospitality, and humility. She followed her dreams with\
  \ a gentle but unbreakable resolve. A woman who carried herself with the dignity\
  \ of age, but with the passion of a young girl, and the infectious giggle of a toddler.\
  \ I will miss you tremendously.\n\nIn the vain hope that this will echo to that\
  \ unreachable place, I owe you an immense debt of gratitude. Arigato gozaimashita,\
  \ sensei."
