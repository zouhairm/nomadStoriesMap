Text: "The year is 2008 and after waiting for what looked like an eternity Alicia\
  \ was finally having a school break, super excited for the summer trip to Angra\
  \ dos Reis, every year she would go on vacation with her parents and brother to\
  \ visit their family, but this year was special because Mr and Mrs overprotective\
  \ decided she was finally old enough to go visit the beaches she heard so much about,\
  \ since Eva and John weren\u2019t big fans of going out and Ali was too young they\
  \ had never given the permission to go, but now she was finally going, unable to\
  \ take that huge smile off her face.\n Angra is an extremely calm place in Brazil,\
  \ known for its beautiful beaches and its sunny weather a lot nicer then the place\
  \ Ali grew up in, S\xE3o Paulo is a very cold and rainy city, full of noises and\
  \ people running all the time.\nFive hours in the car and they arrived at their\
  \ family\u2019s house too exhausted, so they went straight to bed to rest for a\
  \ couple hours, waking up only the next morning, Alicia as always was the first\
  \ one to wake up, and without losing any more time went asking uncle Arthur to take\
  \ her to some beautiful beach, and so they went, but only after lunch as her mother\
  \ demanded.\nIt was happiness and similes all over the place, Ali had no idea she\
  \ would be real close of facing death. For a minute of distraction admiring the\
  \ tiny church at the horizon line over the sea she went following her cousin into\
  \ the see, until she couldn\u2019t feel sand under her feet anymore and soon enough\
  \ couldn\u2019t find oxygen to breath, 30 minutes after that is all she remembers,\
  \ lying in the sand, her lungs burning and everyone\u2019s terrified faces.\nTen\
  \ years later and Ali didn\u2019t get over that burning feeling in her lungs, having\
  \ nightmares every now and then, a sort of trauma she believed, and never went back\
  \ in the sea again but she couldn\u2019t bare that fear any longer, she had moved\
  \ to Angra 2 years after the accident.\nIt had been a cool tour, Ali, her brother\
  \ Tom and a few friends were in a boat, joking and laughing, actually getting used\
  \ to the proximity of the sea, until Tom decided to throw Alicia in the sea, for\
  \ her to overcome her fear, although extremely reckless that is what he did and\
  \ jumped right after her, and there it is again, the fear, the panic growing in\
  \ her stomach, but she had to live, then she calmed herself and thought about the\
  \ swimming lessons she took 2 years ago and started to swim with some difficulty\
  \ at the beginning but getting better and better, overcoming her fear."
