Text: "I always thought myself an expert conversationalist but the prison bars through\
  \ which my new Pakistani friend greeted me through tested these abilities. Thai\
  \ prison signs dictated to never reach through the bars. In Bangkok the detainees\
  \ at the Immigration Detention Center aren\u2019t allowed to physically touch their\
  \ visitor. It didn\u2019t matter to him. The wide smile on this hefty, middle-aged\
  \ refugee lifted us both up. \n The Thai segregate the prison by sex. Visiting hours\
  \ are the only times families see each other. On the other side men hugged their\
  \ wives and held their kids. I stood there, fingers wrapped around the bars, shouting\
  \ for a man I\u2019d never met: Jaqob. Slowly one face turned, gesturing ensued,\
  \ and before I knew it a portly Pakistani stepped up to the bars. His goofy smile\
  \ and salt-and-pepper comb over contrasted with his orange suit. The noise of fifty\
  \ different people trying to communicate echoed off the tin roof, filling the concrete\
  \ bunker. I drew a slow breath, wondering how to proceed. \nJaqob filmed birthdays\
  \ and weddings for the villagers in his hometown. Extremist Muslim clergy visited\
  \ his town, bringing in sweeping reforms. They threatened violence against Jaqob\
  \ and his family for being Christians. Jaqob left his video business (the only one\
  \ in town) with his wife and daughter. The nation of Thailand imprisoned him for\
  \ overstaying his tourist visa by three years. His family remains at large in Bangkok.\
  \ \nHe loves romantic comedies. His favorite is called Chauri. His daughter\u2019\
  s birthday was last Friday. I asked him how old she turned. He smiled the smile\
  \ of proud dads everywhere and told me: \u201CEleven.\u201D This is his third year\
  \ being \u201Cprocessed\u201D in the detention center.\n I ended our conversation\
  \ with one hour left for visitors. After years of blabbering on about nothing important\
  \ I finally ran out of words to say. I apologized. Jaqob shrugged. He didn\u2019\
  t fault extremists for running his family out of town. He didn\u2019t rage at the\
  \ Thai government for imprisoning him. He just smiled that day, living in the moment,\
  \ happy not to be alone.\n I couldn\u2019t rationalize Jaqob\u2019s calm. Incarceration,\
  \ from my perspective, merited more than a shrug but what could Jaqob do? He laughs\
  \ even among fifty screaming inmates. I stress out when my Internet slows down.\
  \ Jaqob taught me that serenity comes from giving up control. He showed me that\
  \ only when you relent can you smile and laugh, even through prison bars."
