Text: "After reading the same sentence again and again for the past 20 minutes, I\
  \ distractedly closed my book. He had barely moved. His eyes slowly examining the\
  \ air. I was staring through my viewless window; outside, all was white. He smiled\
  \ kindly while a man handed him a small package. Both his palms were upturned, willing\
  \ to receive whatever was given. My curiosity arose about the stranger sitting two\
  \ seats to my right, interrupted by an unsettling command: \u201CWoman, never touch\
  \ a monk\u201D.\nI had many questions for that pale, bald-headed man. Moreover,\
  \ an unspoken apology. He had barely moved since our departure, looked like an ivory\
  \ carved monk. \n\u201CSo, why is your robe dark orange?\u201D - my mind had been\
  \ duelling to find a topic to prompt conversation. \u201CI\u2019m a forest monk.\u201D\
  \ \nHe used to be a financial consultant, which anyone could be, he added. Then\
  \ a jazz musician, a more skilled craft in his words. When he decided to travel\
  \ he became an english teacher, which required more specific abilities to engage\
  \ the students. For the past four years he had been living in a buddhist monastery\
  \ in the northern mountains of Thailand, eating what people offered, living in the\
  \ moment, isolated from the world for months in a row. It was very difficult at\
  \ first, he confessed. Rice with ants or fried cockroaches were disgusting to his\
  \ Polish palate. But observing the generosity of people, giving the little food\
  \ they had to the monks, made him feel the essence of the Buddhist philosophy. Focussing\
  \ the mind on being fully aware of thoughts and actions, but particularly of speech,\
  \ is the path to compassion and mindfulness. This truism finally made sense to me.\n\
  As we spoke, he had the most peaceful visage, a tender smile, a bright deep look.\
  \ There was truth and conviction in his words. I could feel his full presence, as\
  \ if he was not an earthly being\u2026 I had yet to apologize. I had been assigned\
  \ the seat next to him, but he requested that I move. A monk cannot touch a woman.\
  \ That is the greatest offense for a Thai and there were many aboard the airplane.\
  \ I sat cornered at the window, grumbling under my breath. By the end of our conversation,\
  \ feeling ashamed, I had learned a greater lesson.\n\u201CNow I know I will die\
  \ in this robe\u201D. \u201CWill you reach Nirvana?\u201D, I asked daringly. With\
  \ water clear blue eyes, this enigmatic monk assured me: \u201CIf you don\u2019\
  t spend your days dwelling in a desired future or in the past, if you accomplish\
  \ to live in the moment, you have reached Nirvana.\u201D"
