Text: "She smiled at me through rusting teeth. It was a characteristic the villagers\
  \ wore like a trademark. She was the Mother of my \u201Csavior.\u201D I knew this\
  \ not because she told me so-her tongue moved only to a sound incomprehensible to\
  \ a foreigner of the remote mountain jungles of Flores, Indonesia. She spit sideways,\
  \ her spidle coloring the trodden sod like a great splash of orange paint. Cultivation\
  \ of tobacco and coffee was all these people knew.\n \n  I was directly ushered\
  \ to the seat of honor- a plastic chair of forest green. Mothers stole timid glances\
  \ while bright coffee colored eyes darted between the folds of their skirts, clearly\
  \ glad for a little excitement on this humid mid-morning. So this is what celebrities\
  \ feel like. \u201CMister, you want kopi?\u201D asked the boy to my left. At sixteen\
  \ years old, he spoke better English than I\u2019d hoped for in this remote region.\
  \ He was the reason for my recent rise to stardom, rescuing me from a most unpleasant\
  \ journey back to civilization.  \n\n Van Kempo found me hopelessly bouncing my\
  \ scooter through an entanglement of rocks I had mistaken for a road. The promise\
  \ of a waterfall had drawn me into this dual with death. Where was this thing anyway?\
  \ Where in the world was I? Roadmaps where about as useless as a GPS here. I drove\
  \ until I could drive no further. I wouldn\u2019t find this magical waterfall anyway,\
  \ it was too hot, I\u2019d had enough adventure for a day, and I should probably\
  \ call my mother if I made it out alive.  Then there we were, Van Kempo and an idiot\
  \ tourist, laughing for pure comedy\u2019s sake.  \n\nHe was the reason for the\
  \ soothing taste of sweet, rich coffee on my tongue. Groves of banana plants and\
  \ clusters of coconut trees engulfed the little village. I did my best to answer\
  \ Van Kempo\u2019s questions of where I was from in between bites of biscuits and\
  \ plump juicy mango. \u201CI come from America.\u201D Approval. It wasn\u2019t often\
  \ a foreigner got lost in their backyard, so they insisted to feast me on dried\
  \ sardines and rice. Mother served with that same orange smile.  Van Kempo did take\
  \ me to the waterfall, puffing on a cigarette the whole time. \n\n As the jungle\
  \ readied itself for the peaceful quiet of dusk, I waved my thanks and settled into\
  \ an hour drive back to Labuan Bajo. It was true, these people lacked most conveniences\
  \ the world would deem as necessities. What was even more true was that they shared\
  \ something with me I didn\u2019t realize I needed. Something purely human. A rarity\
  \ worth crossing the oceans for."
