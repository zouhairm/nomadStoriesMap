Text: "I was walking lost in a polluted road in \u201CHabana Vieja\u201D (the old\
  \ Havana) \u2013 Cuba, with no trees, just the colored old cars, looking for a place\
  \ to take a rest in the dusk, when I saw an old club on the side of the road: \u201C\
  La casa del tango\u201D (The house of Tango). Across the window, in the dark, I\
  \ saw people looking at a little concert in front of a Carlos Gardel's blow... I\
  \ said \u201Cwow\u201D and decided to get in. All along there were historical artifact\
  \ of the tango era: magazines, records, objects, pictures and paintings about tango,\
  \ but why here in Cuba? The singer, a woman with a ruffled long dress, and the guitarist\
  \ were Argentineans; I just listened them till the final applause, then trying to\
  \ talk to them, so I discovered they were hosted by Ruben, the owner of this place,\
  \ a seventy years old smiling man; Ruben told me that he organizes a tango festival\
  \ in Havana every year in June, but you can't find it on internet: you must be invited\
  \ directly; then he told me about his father, a cuban tango dancer, the founder\
  \ of the house and about the tango's diffusion on the island; even Gardel was there\
  \ like his big portrait caressing cuban children was showing to me. I said \u201C\
  wow\u201D again. Ruben invited me for a beer and then I offered a pizza to everyone.\
  \ Cultural exchange. During the dinner he talked about some young lucky cuban people,\
  \ the richest, in a way, that travelled, coming not there, 'cause the dance level\
  \ is too low.\nHe said he couldn't study outside the island and the poorest cubans\
  \ coming there could not even them, so their tango didn't grow up and they do a\
  \ mix of salsa and tango. He says that he's not a tango dancer, but he dances anyway.\n\
  The other people dance on the street on Sunday afternoons: he gave the address to\
  \ me.\nI couldn't film this interview, but maybe the following Monday for the tango\
  \ practice will be possible.\nSo maybe 'cause I'm a tango dancer too or maybe 'cause\
  \ I'm just curious, I decided to stop in Havana for another week.\nIn Paseo del\
  \ Prado, a busy road with a pedestrian area (busy too) in the center, finally I\
  \ danced with such beautiful and graceful cuban girls before talking with one of\
  \ the organizers. Luca organizes a \u201Cmilonga\u201D (tango meeting) once a month\
  \ but they don't want to go to Ruben's place 'cause he indirectly doesn't want them\
  \ to go there, making conflicts. So, which is the truth? One thing is sure: Ruben\
  \ is jealous about them and they are jealous about his ballroom."
