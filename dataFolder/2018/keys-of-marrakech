Text: "You can get lost in Marrakech. Easily. Everyone told me.\nI didn\u2019t want\
  \ to, so I willingly accepted that second-hand map. I studied it in every detail,\
  \ drawing traits and signs on that intricate maze of paper. It was my keys of the\
  \ city.\n\nThen we landed.\n\nIt took little to understand that if time was a place,\
  \ this would be Marrakech.\nThe past ages, now immobile elsewhere, live here today.\
  \ And today lives the present, in its bold nonchalance, in its inexorable pass.\
  \ Here you find the future, perhaps fertile, certainly next.\n\nIt\u2019s hot, in\
  \ Marrakech. And you thinks it\u2019s hot while peering the profile of the snow-covered\
  \ Atlas from the walls of the El Badi Palace. It looks like a mirage, that mythical\
  \ mass that supports the sky.\nBut the masters of this sky are others. The storks,\
  \ with their nests too big to seem real, with\ntheir bickering, perennial guard\
  \ of a city that worships them. They\u2019re not afraid, now accustomed to the swarm\
  \ of life and noise, even when the dirge of the muezzin shakes the buzz of the city.\n\
  \nLife in Marrakech is repeated, as the call to prayer, but it is never the same.\n\
  It is the tired trampling of an encyclopedia of the world: it\u2019s the dried shark\
  \ eggs sold in the bazaar, it\u2019s a mint tea with a view on the flat roofs, it\u2019\
  s the women with veils who take care of the flower beds as if they were their garden,\
  \ it is the young and forward-looking king that has understood that from Morocco\
  \ can pass the future of a greener world.\n\nMarrakech is in the Jemaa El Fna Square,\
  \ the placid heart that pumps life in the city\u2019s veins.\nShe is in the contrasts\
  \ that nourish and terrify, a barbaric beauty that is purified every evening in\
  \ sunsets of fire.\nLetting the maps stay in the place where they belong, in your\
  \ luggage, maybe you\u2019ll find your way through the tangle of alleyways in the\
  \ Medina; you\u2019ll come to the Marrakech of Cyber Park. In the regenerating shade\
  \ there is a prize for your first time travel. You will walk in a suspended place,\
  \ drawing long shadows on palm trees, fountains and signs that talk about urban\
  \ development and reducing water consumption. In this oasis, children play, males\
  \ with males and females... females sitting close to their mothers. \n\nThe city\
  \ doesn\u2019t make the effort to hide or embellish herself. She is there, with\
  \ her derelict and her blessed, and she is stretching in the sun with her offspring\
  \ of cats.\n\nTo discover her you do not need a city map. Marrakech only waits for\
  \ you to want to travel in time."
