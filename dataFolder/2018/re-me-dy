Text: "This is one of my real trip. Real by any normal known definition. For me, travel\
  \ can mean many things. My favorite one, which also my least favorite is travel\
  \ through dream. It\u2019s exciting, scary, tiring, confusing, and torturing even.\
  \ \nI believe that God talk to us through so many ways. I like to think that we\u2019\
  re born with part of big plan to keep balance on this universe, so when the plan\
  \ you made after you were born go to complete different direction with your initial\
  \ plan, then you will fight it. You will try to remind yourself in any ways possible.\
  \ \nI\u2019m a girl with logic, so sometimes, even me rejecting this nonsense theory.\
  \ I\u2019d tried my best to ignore them. But then about two years ago, I started\
  \ to get these pieces. I got the same dreams over and over again. I get the message\
  \ from the first one. I know what I\u2019m supposed to do, but I didn\u2019t do\
  \ it right away, so they continue to bugging me. I hate the fact that I\u2019m freak\
  \ like that, considering to paying attention to something that might not even real.\
  \ But I also hate the fact that I keep betraying myself by denying it even more,\
  \ because I know that the pain, the long, even the memories feel real, so I start\
  \ to listen to them. Don\u2019t care how ridiculous it seems.\nI took this trip\
  \ to think about that. I deserted myself on that island to be with myself, away\
  \ from everyone, so that I can think clearly, whether I should do it or not. I stay\
  \ there for ten days to do nothing. It was only one day where I got out to a seminar,\
  \ hoping that I found someone who can understand this. But I met this woman instead.\
  \ She just happened to sit next to me during the break-time, and willingly tell\
  \ her story, without me asking. Just like that. Just that one story and I get my\
  \ answer. \nHer story reminds me that our teamwork will always funny like that.\
  \ Some of us have to agree to hurt someone in order to keep this world exists. Bad\
  \ now, doesn\u2019t mean because it was bad then. Also doesn\u2019t mean it has\
  \ no good later. They will keep take turn. Even after we long gone, maybe it\u2019\
  s our bad doing that start a very good output later. Or maybe it\u2019s our good\
  \ deed that will cause a major disaster for everyone. Who knows, right? No one will\
  \ live that long to see the outcome of their life.\nI\u2019m glad that through this\
  \ journey I can put more pieces to my puzzle. I may not see any great view, back\
  \ then. I also didn\u2019t take any picture. But above all, I me(e)t me. I get to\
  \ realize that I\u2019m good, but also bad person. I am both. Well, we all are."
