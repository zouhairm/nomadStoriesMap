Text: "The final ascent up Kilimanjaro has to be made at midnight, before the snow\
  \ starts to melt. You have to hike for about 6 hours the day before, then you get\
  \ around 4 hours to eat and sleep, and then it's up to the top. For a long while\
  \ you can't see past your headlamps. The altitude sickness and exhaustion start\
  \ to kick in and people shout ridiculous nonsense at each other. Nothing is quite\
  \ real. I remember knowing my body moving, and the cold biting my face, but everything\
  \ else was questionable. My knees kept caving and my thigh muscles twitched at intervals.\
  \ \n\nThen this bright orange and purple ball of flame pushed through the snow and\
  \ revealed the grandeur of what we had been struggling through for hours. I could\
  \ see the top now, just a few steps away. Some of my friends were already there.\
  \ The sun renewed my energy and my spirits and I shoved myself further on.  \n\n\
  That's what I remembering thinking just before I collapsed. I still don't know what\
  \ exactly happened, but my foot slipped and suddenly I was on the ground shivering.\
  \ The next minute two tour guides had me by the armpits and dragged me to the bottom\
  \ as quickly as they could. \n\nOnce I realised what was happening I struggled to\
  \ be set free. I had to make it to the top, I would make it to the top, they had\
  \ to let me try again. 7 months of training, playing 4 sports for a year just so\
  \ I could make sure I was fit enough. All to get dragged all the way back down by\
  \ the two fastest men I had ever seen. Everything I had trained for and seen, wasted.\
  \ \n\nAs far as mountains go, the climb up Kiimanjaro is quite short. Three days\
  \ up, and two days down. There are a few other routes you can take, but this one\
  \ is the easiest and least time consuming.  \n\nThe first day is gorgeous and lush\
  \ with jungle trees, and vines. It's also the steepest day. The next day is flatter,\
  \ moorland. The plants and animals in this climate zone look like they escaped from\
  \ a fairy tale.  \n\nThe food leaves something to be desired, and set the tone for\
  \ the remainder of the trip. Dinners consisted of a flour meal called 'ugali\u2019\
  , a couple of burnt and rubbery sausages. Breakfast isn't much better; watery, flavourless\
  \ porridge with tea or hot chocolate, and a slice of toast on the side. Lunch was\
  \ always the best meal, a sandwich with some fruits and a granola bar. Thinking\
  \ back on it now I wish I had savoured every meal. \n\nI never made it to the top\
  \ that day. But I made it to my top. And someday I'll go back and conquer the actual\
  \ peak."
