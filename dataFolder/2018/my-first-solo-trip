Text: "I always thought being in the comfort zone would never let me explore my dreams\
  \ in a way one is born to do.\nI was ten; my first trip was overland with my family.\
  \ Travelling became an adventure I love, so every chance there was I say 'yes',\
  \ as a teenager. Opportunities were coming; travelling with the school, with friends,\
  \ travelling for youth exchanges projects, and more with my family.\nUntil the age\
  \ of 17, I always travelled with someone, once or twice every year. As a matter\
  \ of fact, there were those myths that travelling solo is fear; 'the world out there\
  \ is different from here', 'being alone is sad', 'a new place is unknown'. Those\
  \ myths were letting me back and stay in my comfort zone. I was at an age that I\
  \ am a young adult closer to eighteen and I was responsible for my own decisions.\
  \ \nOne evening, I chatted with a foreign friend on social media, barely know her,\
  \ only met in the previous year on an exchange project. Talking to her pushed me\
  \ to take a decision and travel solo for the first time. She offered me to pick\
  \ me up from the airport, Brussels and live with her. Surfing the Web for cheap\
  \ flights and booked, this was all without telling any relatives until printed the\
  \ tickets. I was still worrying. Will she pick me up from the airport? What if I\
  \ get lost? How will I communicate in another language?\nFrom time to time, the\
  \ moment to go to the airport arrived. My heart is pounding. I arrived. This is\
  \ crazy. Finally, I met my friend. It was late at night, it was dark, we drove to\
  \ her house in France and she gave me her spare room to sleep.\nI couldn't believe\
  \ that I had done this. I had nothing planned for my trip. The next morning, I headed\
  \ out to walk in the small town. There were shops, park and people in the streets.\
  \ At some point, I found tourist information and popped in. Started collecting some\
  \ leaflets to inspire myself where I should go.\nI planned for every day. After\
  \ all, it was a dream came true. I went to different towns; catching the trains\
  \ and walking from a place to another, communicating with local people to take me\
  \ a photo. I wasn't afraid of nothing anymore. Even when I got lost an hour before\
  \ I had to catch the train to head back to home. I stayed calm and enjoyed my adventure.\
  \ In reality, I was full filled with lone energy that I can integrate with anyone.\n\
  This trip put me in a step where I had learnt more to be responsible for myself\
  \ and take actions on my decisions. The dream one wants in this world, we have to\
  \ make them exists."
