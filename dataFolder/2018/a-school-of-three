Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s scary that he has a knife!\u201D\n\nThe little girl pointed\
  \ at our guide\u2019s ankle and clung to her mother. If only she knew how safe that\
  \ knife made me feel. Jose didn\u2019t mind her and gave a big, comforting smile.\n\
  \nI was annoyed on his behalf. We weren\u2019t supposed to be with this family of\
  \ four. We weren\u2019t even supposed to be on this boat, but the tour company had\
  \ a mix up, so here we were. I turned to look out over the side of our little, square\
  \ motorboat and enjoy the wind pulling at my hair. I wondered how long it would\
  \ be until we found one, a whale shark, here in the Sea of Cortez. We had been told\
  \ that the whole process would be fast. After spotting a shark, we were expected\
  \ to be in the water following our guide within seconds. My friend was happier in\
  \ the boat, so before I knew it there were six of us in the water chasing something\
  \ yet unseen.\n\nThe wind was causing the waves to thrash, and at first I found\
  \ it hard to keep myself oriented. Jose instructed us to stay close, but as quickly\
  \ as he\u2019d said it, he dashed off in the direction of the beast. I had always\
  \ been a strong swimmer, but I struggled to keep pace. I also struggled to see through\
  \ the water churning ahead of me. The family of four must have been new to the sport,\
  \ because they continuously attempted to feed me their flippers. After a struggle\
  \ to break off from the pack, I was finally able to look into the serenity of the\
  \ water below the waves. The sight before me was a treasure I will never relinquish.\
  \ A massive turquoise fish with spots from head to toe rose through the murky water.\
  \ The gentle swaying of its tail gave the illusion of a leisurely pace, even as\
  \ it raced out of sight. Moments, mere moments. That\u2019s all we had with the\
  \ creature.\n\nJose quickly directed us back to the boat, and we began again. Jump,\
  \ swim, race. Jump, swim, race. The speed clearly began to take its toll, and for\
  \ the final jump only two splashes were made.\n\nUntil now, we had all clung to\
  \ the surface, glancing down longingly at the great fish below, but seeing as now\
  \ I was the only patron in the water, Jose could afford to relax. In an instant\
  \ I watched him transform from the vigilant guide into a shooting dart as he dove\
  \ deep into the water to join stride with the passing shark. To his surprise I followed,\
  \ and despite the snorkel between his lips, his excited smile beamed at me from\
  \ across the great spotted fish. Then together we swam, a school of three, gliding\
  \ through the depths of the Sea of Cortez."
