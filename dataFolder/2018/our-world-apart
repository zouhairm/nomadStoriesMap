Text: "I reached out into the morning light and caught sight of the Andes across the\
  \ water as I stepped out onto the deck and into the day.\nI wasn\u2019t sure how\
  \ I got here. Or rather, I wasn\u2019t quite sure how the series of choices I made\
  \ brought me into Jorge\u2019s backyard, where I stood gazing across the Pacific\
  \ from an island perched on Chile\u2019s southern edge.\nAfter a year of teaching\
  \ in Concepci\xF3n, Chile\u2019s second largest city, I rode south to find some\
  \ space and quiet before I returned to the US. One of my best friends from my time\
  \ there enchanted me with stories of Chilo\xE9\u2019s shingle-style churches, the\
  \ island\u2019s tradition of witchcraft, and curanto\u2014 a dish prepared by burying\
  \ a fire in the earth to smoke delicate flavors into meat and fish alike.\nI never\
  \ sampled curanto, but after Jorge spied me hitchhiking he invited me to join him\
  \ and his wife Rosa for pastel de jaiba, a creamy Chilean crab cake \u2013and then\
  \ into their home. The next day we set off in a Zodiac to collect ocean life from\
  \ the sea floor. Jorge slipped into his wet suit, and disappeared into the water\
  \ knife in hand to return laden with oysters, polyps, and a bounty of marine life,\
  \ which vanished in our mouths.\nEverything we enjoyed, everything Jorge shared\
  \ with me with a disarming kindness and expansive generosity is threatened by the\
  \ exploitation of Chilo\xE9, and the surrounding archipelago\u2019s natural resources.\
  \ Not long after we met, Jorge wrote me in May 2016, when a red tide washed up dead\
  \ marine life on the island\u2019s shores. The planned construction of bridge linking\
  \ Chilo\xE9 to the coast would likely accelerate the environmental damage through\
  \ increased accessibility.\nWith Jorge, I found a haven from the mad pace of the\
  \ world that is now at risk from this same force. Before I left, he and Rosa took\
  \ me to work on their boat, hauling buoys and setting lines into place.\nOne night\
  \ we came back from a day at sea, and walked up the deck and into a neighbor\u2019\
  s home to celebrate his birthday. (He had spotted us tying up, fifty meters from\
  \ his front door.) Jorge and Rosa\u2019s unexpected welcome, the openness of everyone\
  \ I met to take me in and accept me as a friend and companion touched and startled\
  \ me. But like the marine life, Jorge and his community depend on a fragile balance\
  \ being maintained, which can so easily be washed away. As I sung feliz cumplea\xF1\
  os, sipping beer with friends-and-strangers, I felt utterly lost. Or perhaps it\
  \ was that Jorge had found me, as he did right from beginning, tumbling along a\
  \ road."
