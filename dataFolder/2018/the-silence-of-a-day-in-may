Text: "The silence of a day in May \n\nI love hills, the street going up and down\
  \ make you feel like you have owned the experience and thus, deserving of what the\
  \ city has to offer. If you climb up one side of the street, next time you come\
  \ down the other, it is the only way to piece it all together.  When you bike or\
  \ drive through a city you can piece together the most important sights to visit\
  \ when arriving for the very first time. \nI have learnt that what brings most thrill\
  \ and joy is the familiarity of buildings, and even if we discover a new place,\
  \ could nonetheless feel connected already, as if you have walked through it before\
  \ and at the same time, all the details we so enthusiastically discover brings the\
  \ joy of seeing for the first time.  \nThere are no bad roads to take. Wherever\
  \ you go, what you see is utter beauty and just wondering around will still lead\
  \ you to gorgeous places, colours, trees and flowers, and meticulously painted coffee\
  \ shop signs. And just by entering one, you become part of the local social life.\
  \ In the morning, those who enter for an espresso and a croissant, while reading\
  \ the newspaper, chat about what their day might bring and how the decisions of\
  \ politicians affects them. Each and everyone has an oppinion and is not afraid\
  \ of voicing it. There are no chairs or tables, so the conversation is open to everyone\
  \ and everyone is welcome to join in. \nIt is difficult to find a favourite place\
  \ in Rome. There are too many places worth seeing, too  many corners behind which\
  \ some other beauty is awaiting you. A fading color on the side of a church, and\
  \ the coolness inside for those who are escaping the already burning sun. And by\
  \ entering its wooden door you leave behind the noise of motorinos. The contrast\
  \ is sharp: it directs you attention towards inside and inside yourself. And as\
  \ you slowly walk through, next to the walls, you recognize a painting of Caravaggio,\
  \ and another one, right in front of you, not separated by glass  or any other structure\
  \ and if you tried to reach it, you could, as it\u2019s just there, so close, as\
  \ you might believe for a second that it has been just finished and the busy painter\
  \ just stepped out for a glass of limoncello. \nAs I sit down, I can hear the old\
  \ priest behind me whisper words of prayer and I let it be my words of prayer, too.\
  \ I sit before him and I feel I am allowed to join in. His silence conveys what\
  \ is the most important: when outer beauty fills you, you need your silence to let\
  \ it sink in, and make it your own."
