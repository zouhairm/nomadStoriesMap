Text: "Koh Phi Phi is Thailand\u2019s island superstar. Having lived in rural Thailand\
  \ as an English teacher for seven months, I tended to steer clear of such tourist\
  \ destinations and their hedonistic vacationers. Nevertheless, we decided to do\
  \ a long-tail boat tour of the surrounding islands. After impressing the driver\
  \ with my less than impressive ability to speak Thai, we settled on a reasonable\
  \ price and climbed into the boat. \nOur driver was a round, convivial Thai man\
  \ named Ameen who wore a Bob Marley scarf around his head like a du-rag. Every now\
  \ and then as we bounced over the waves Ameen\u2019s voice boomed from the stern,\
  \ \u201CTeachaaa! Teacha, you fine?\u201D To which I would stick a thumb in the\
  \ air and shout back, \u201CSabai dee, ka!\u201D \nThrough broken conversation,\
  \ we quickly built a friendship with Ameen.  As the sun began to set, we regretfully\
  \ mentioned that the three hours we had paid for were up. \n\u201CMai bpen rai!\u201D\
  \ Ameen roared. \u201CYou like I take you place very beautiful for sunset!\u201D\
  \ \nWe happily said that yes, we like very much, and as Ameen steered the boat around\
  \ the corner of a limestone tower, we fell silent at the sight before us. The cliffs\
  \ huddled shoulder to shoulder creating a quiet cove, and the setting sun cast a\
  \ rosy glow on the subdued waves. At the base of the cliff were seven long-tail\
  \ boats retired for the evening and tied side by side. One man with a long, dark\
  \ braid sat stirring rice over a portable stove and as our boat sidled up next to\
  \ his we were welcomed with small bowls of rice. \nOver dinner we asked Ameen about\
  \ his work, and were shocked to find out that for months at a time Ameen lived on\
  \ that very boat. Every day he ducked and climbed and was at the constant beck and\
  \ call of tourists. At the end of the day, he only made about twelve dollars, most\
  \ of which was sent to his mother in Bangkok. In saying this his jovial smile flickered\
  \ for a second, but he beamed again, raising his drink, \u201CI have nothing!\u201D\
  \ he cried. \u201CI am happy!\u201D\nIn time, the sun was tucked away and stars\
  \ like scattered embers winked down upon us as we reclined against the sides of\
  \ the boat listening to reggae music drifting out onto the Andaman sea.  Time slipped\
  \ away, and it was suggested that we sleep on the boat. \u201CWe treat like VIP,\u201D\
  \ Ameen said, arranging life jackets for us to lie on. \u201CYou are family.\u201D\
  \nDrifting to sleep, we faintly heard music beginning to throb as tourists flocked\
  \ to the beach for full moon parties. But for us, all was still and simple, and\
  \ we too were happy."
