Text: "Darkness began to surround us as the sun set behind the Himalayas. We continue\
  \ up a stone path leading us to the third largest Hindu temple in the world - Pashupatinath.\
  \ The smog in the air seemed to grow thicker as the light slipped away. As we came\
  \ over the hill I start to see several lights in the distance. Getting closer I\
  \ see they look like small bonfires scattered along a brown, polluted river. \n\n\
  \"Those are bodies, you know?\"\nI turn my head following the voice. \n\"Those are\
  \ dead bodies. This temple is a funeral ground.\"\n\nAnd so, it was. \n\nHundreds\
  \ of Hindus a day would travel from Nepal, India, and surrounding countries to bring\
  \ their dead within hours of their passing. Their dead are carried to a diagonal\
  \ cement wall next to the river. Here family members take turns splashing droplets\
  \ of hope onto their loved ones praying for their reincarnation. Though part of\
  \ their funeral ceremony, it is a foreign concept to me. \n\n I see five men sitting\
  \ on the ground to my right. Wearing all orange with marigold necklaces and faces\
  \ covered in peeling white paint, they're easy to spot- Hindu priests. I make eye\
  \ contact with one. His eyes are dark and empty. As though he has been in a place\
  \ of death for too long. Chills run up my spine. \n\nMovement in the corner of my\
  \ eye draws my attention. A troop of thirty monkeys run by me, easily climbing up\
  \ and down buildings. My once excitement to see these creatures is replaced by fear\
  \ and caution as I see their human-like abilities. \n\nCrossing over a bridge I\
  \ look to my left and see a smaller fire than the others; a child burning. My stomach\
  \ drops. I have never seen death in such a tangible way before. My mind doesn't\
  \ know how to process it. In America, we don't talk about death often. We are all\
  \ about living life to the fullest and not thinking about the end. It was different\
  \ here. \n\nI watched a trail of smoke rise up into the sky drawing my attention\
  \ to the main temple. The hue of the evening light reflected off of its gold covering.\
  \ \n\nAs I try to process everything before me I come to my conclusion. Life has\
  \ value and purpose, but it will end. Someday we will all end up in a fire of our\
  \ own as we leave this world. May we not waste the time we are given."
