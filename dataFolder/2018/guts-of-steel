Text: "Breeze whisking through my hair, the smell of food cooking mixed with the salt\
  \ water seeped into my nostrils. As I looked around I was completely shocked. No\
  \ patches of grass anywhere, the buildings were old and not very well kept. Children\
  \ walked around with poles filled with beautiful handmade bracelets, trying to help\
  \ support their families in any way possible. Stray dogs ran around scavenging for\
  \ food, something we were warned about before we landed on the island. \u201CDon\u2019\
  t touch the dogs\u201D rang through my ears as we walked past them. \n\nI thought\
  \ back to the beginning of my trip. I woke up at four am, to my dog licking my face\
  \ and lights shining in my eyes, laying in my own queen bed. I knew that these people\
  \ didn\u2019t get to have luxuries like I did but I was still shocked. \n\n Walking\
  \ through the water, I looked around at all the stores and noticed that a lot of\
  \ people were out front picking up trash. The further I walked, I realized the spots\
  \ where there were plots of empty land were covered in trash. I stepped down into\
  \ the ferry and the faces of tired, hard-working people smiled at me and my family\
  \ as we piled in. The ride was an hour and a half of jolting over waves. My stomach\
  \ churning, I thought about the locals who made this trip everyday must have a gut\
  \ of steel to ride this. We jumped out and walked through the marketplace, in the\
  \ direction of our waiting driver. Chickens ran past us, and people greeted us with\
  \ soft faces. They asked us where we were from and always joked about the cold after\
  \ we told them we lived in Minnesota. Then asked us kindly to come look around their\
  \ stores. Finally making it to the end of the strip of stores we found our driver\
  \ and started on our two-hour trek to the ruins. As we drove from town to town,\
  \ each one got worse. This was something I wasn\u2019t prepared for at all. The\
  \ \u201Chouses\u201D we saw I would consider shacks. The people were wearing raggedy,\
  \ old, unwashed clothes. The realities that not everyone got the chances like I\
  \ have in my life really hit me. As we conversed with our driver I was taken aback.\
  \ He said many of these people live off of practically nothing. It opened my eyes\
  \ to see that these people work hard to just make it by.  Remembering back to the\
  \ kids selling bracelets on the island, it shows how resilient these people have\
  \ to be. It shocked and humbled me that what I consider \u201Cmy necessities\u201D\
  \ are very different than theirs."
