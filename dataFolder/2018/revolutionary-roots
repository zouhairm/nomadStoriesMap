Text: "Uncle *** had been the kind of uncle everyone has or if they didn\u2019t, they\
  \ wanted. Immovable in most respests and therefore stubborn but always there. He\
  \ was the one who\u2019d told us all the family history with all the enthusiasm\
  \ of someone who was there even if most the events happened before he was born.\
  \ It was at his funeral in the Irish Catholic area of Kensal Green cemetery in London\u2019\
  s now fashionable North West that one story in particular became an obsession. Years\
  \ before he\u2019d recounted how the family had left Galway when Cromwell had stormed\
  \ the country. The family had split in two with one half travelling to Barbados\
  \ and the other to Argentina. They never met again but my half returned to Ireland\
  \ eight generations later, but what of the other half? In so many respects travel\
  \ is about people. People are the lynch-pin in cultures that bring it alive and\
  \ provide the breath of intrigue that draws the curios from their homes to the heights\
  \ of the unknown. This is the story of how a family fable led me to Ireland and\
  \ on to Argentina where I discovered a country, a people, a family and a a certain\
  \ Uncle Che."
