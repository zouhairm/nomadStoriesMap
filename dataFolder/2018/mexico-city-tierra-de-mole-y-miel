Text: "It\u2019s mid-morning when we stop at a curbside food stand just outside of\
  \ Mexico City\u2019s San Juan Gourmet Food Market. \u201CAren\u2019t we going in\
  \ there?\u201D I ask Carla. \u201CNo,\u201D she says, \u201Cthe magic actually starts\
  \ right out here.\u201D Se\xF1ora Rosa is already set up for the lunch rush when\
  \ we snag one of the small red plastic stools surrounding a hot comal and three\
  \ women furiously patting masa with bare hands. Their morning began before sunrise,\
  \ prepping ingredients and packing up freshly ground masa de ma\xEDz from their\
  \ hometown, about a 90-minute bus ride outside of Mexico City. It\u2019s taken two\
  \ hours for the group to ultimately settle at their unmarked sidewalk post across\
  \ from the market, one which Se\xF1ora Rosa has \u201Cowned\u201D for years.\n\n\
  Carla exchanges a warm greeting with the ladies and asks for the \u201Cregular.\u201D\
  \ Se\xF1ora Rosa smiles, takes out a palm-sized scoop of purple masa and starts\
  \ forming her signature offering, a tlacoyo. She shapes the dough in her hands,\
  \ which are weathered from years of grinding and kneading and patting. With a quick\
  \ flick of her spoon, she stuffs the tlacoyo with fava beans and fresh cheese, closes\
  \ it up, and throws it on the griddle. The result is a flat, football-shaped snack\
  \ topped with nopales and cheese that chilangos, the local term for Mexico City\
  \ residents, enjoy huddled up on street corners for a quick lunch or afternoon snack.\
  \ It\u2019s delicious. I notice that the corners of Se\xF1ora Rosa's eyes turn down\
  \ when she smiles. What really comes through from that sheepish smile though is\
  \ her serene dedication to nurturing passersby with her delicacies, even in the\
  \ context of this dirty and bustling pedestrian thoroughfare. This contrast indelibly\
  \ becomes etched into the mind.\n\nIn general, Mexico City is a land of contrasts.\
  \ It\u2019s the mundane nestled up against the extraordinary. One walks into the\
  \ exquisitely tiled facade of the Casa de los Azulejos, an 18th-century palace,\
  \ to find a Sanborns department store selling blenders and pantyhose. Taggers have\
  \ taken over abandoned buildings to create beautiful street art scenes. World-class\
  \ restaurants that marry modern culinary techniques and ancient local ingredients\
  \ sit right next to street stands run by third-generation ma\xEDz farmers whose\
  \ tlacoyos will knock your socks off. Mexico City is a fascinating coalescence of\
  \ two extremes, like mole and miel: gritty and spicy, coating your tongue with intrigue\
  \ and possibility while also being pure, sweet, and refined\u2014giving you the\
  \ feeling that magic happens here."
