Text: "Luis Guerrillo Pedroso Bolivar is running. He just runs, running  is the only\
  \ way to save himself. \nHis pursuers are behind him: he can only imagine their\
  \ dirty breaths, their inhuman faces, but he can hear them shouting loud. They are\
  \ three hunky men, and they\u2019re armed. They smell of urine and rotting flesh.\
  \ \nThe blood of slaughtered animals is running at the sides of the streets, dyeing\
  \ them red. Luis Bolivar hurts a man pushing a cart and he sees his pursuers behind.\
  \ Now, they\u2019re five men: there are also One-Eyed Carlos holding a machete and\
  \ Mu\xF1oz holding a stick.\nIn front of the covered market, a lot  of people are\
  \ crowding together. Bolivar crawls between rough and brand legs. A man hits him\
  \ in the kidney and Bolivar goes blind for a while. When he opens his eyes , he\u2019\
  s still inside the market. He runs upstairs. He\u2019s looking for his pursuers\
  \ through the window and he sees them while they\u2019re hitting people in the crowd.\
  \ One-Eyed\u2019s machete shines over the heads then it disappears: the Colombian\
  \ prisoner is yelling with agony in the middle of the crowd. His hand is in a pool\
  \ of blood. I\u2019m watching the entire scene from Lisander\u2019s house and I\u2019\
  m feeling bad. \nBolivar is at the second floor of the market. He\u2019s watching\
  \ down: I can see a terrible fear on his face. This preason is a big insane society.\n\
  Luis Bolivar jumps down to the patio and he remains there for a long second. He\u2019\
  s still alive: he\u2019s back on his feet. \nOne-Eyed\u2019s angry voice touches\
  \ Bolivar\u2019s ears: he\u2019s running away. \nLuis Guerrillo Pedroso Bolivar\
  \ is hopeless. He runs and he hurts the meat counter: beef heart and pieces of pork\
  \ tumble all around. Bolivar runs between the stands, his pursuers are reaching\
  \ him. Entering the stadium, they look like some gladiators.\nI\u2019m still watching\
  \ the scene: it\u2019s the last thing I expected to see during my Bolivian journey."
