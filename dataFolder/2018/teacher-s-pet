Text: "The Pink City is a harsh blend of rich scents, bright colours and choking smog.\
  \ I was on a month placement, teaching children basic English in a makeshift classroom\
  \ deep within a vast slum.  Every morning we\u2019d swerve off the main drag of\
  \ downtown Jaipur between modern, gleaming skyscrapers and glittering palaces of\
  \ the Raj, our tuktuk spluttering exhaust fumes over chai and roti-peddlers in their\
  \ lean-to tents packed tightly against the terracotta palace walls. We\u2019d rumble\
  \ down a rutted track with severe trenches on either side oozing oily water, thick\
  \ with rotting trash that festered as the heat bore down from above. \nTwins Puja\
  \ and Priya were always sure to graciously leave their single set of battered sandals\
  \ at the door before entering class. One would wear the left sandal and the other\
  \ the right. Rakesh would be carried over the bare concrete threshold on sister\
  \ Anju\u2019s hip, his eyes lined with black charcoal paint by their mother \u2018\
  so that he cannot see the darkness in the world\u2019.\nAnd famously late to arrive\
  \ each day was Hansa. Her once yellow and red Winnie the Pooh dress on back-to-front,\
  \ presumably so she could see to button it up, as she had no one left to get her\
  \ ready for school.\nTeachers shouldn\u2019t have favourites, but I allowed myself\
  \ a particular affinity with the bright-eyed and ashen-faced Hansa. I longed for\
  \ a way to improve her circumstance and my heart would heave at her genuine \u2018\
  thank you, Mr\u2019 every afternoon that we\u2019d part ways again, watching her\
  \ totter back to the clay-walled alcove with tarpaulin roof she called home.\nIn\
  \ their five or six years on this earth these children have seen more hardship than\
  \ I ever will, and whats fascinating is that they had no idea. Their beaming smiles\
  \ and wide eyes a total contradiction to the injustice the world has served them.\n\
  Four short weeks passed as quickly as the freight trains that crashed back and forth\
  \ on the viaduct overhead. I knew my efforts of the past month wouldn\u2019t make\
  \ a trace of difference to their fortunes, but I got a quiet satisfaction knowing\
  \ that for those few hours in the day these innocent kids were safe from the cruelties\
  \ of the outside world within our little schoolhouse. \nHansa, my ray of hope in\
  \ this destitute corner, raised a tiny arm in farewell as my rickshaw rattled back\
  \ down the potholed track towards the highway for the last time, and I sat back\
  \ on the torn up leather seat wondering where the future will permit her to end\
  \ up, choking back guilty, smog-stained tears."
