Text: "As usual, I chose the seat by the window. It had just snowed the night before\
  \ and I wanted to absorb the view as much as I could while staying indoors. Being\
  \ a sunny California native, I wasn\u2019t particularly keen to anything below 60\
  \ degrees fahrenheit.\n\n\u201COne kaffi latte with porridge and berry preserves,\
  \ ready at the bar.\u201D the barista announced.\n\nIt was my first adequate meal\
  \ in Iceland. Much better than the cheap airport wine and leftover potato chips\
  \ from my plane ride.\n\nI clutched the warm mug with both hands. The ceramic rim\
  \ never strayed farther than several inches from my lips at a time. I studied passerbyers\
  \ along the vibrant streets of Reykjavik, like some house cat on a ledge. Immersed\
  \ in comfort, the melted ice invading my boots no longer bothered me. Moments later,\
  \ I noticed a woman pushing a stroller approach the door.\n\nI got up to hold it\
  \ open for her, assuming she could use a hand. She thanked me, parked the stroller\
  \ outside (the babe clearly still in it), and walked in.\n\nMy shrunken face revealed\
  \ my puzzled state.\n\n\u201CYou\u2019re not from here are you?\u201D she asked.\n\
  \nMy cheeks became flushed. How could she gather that just by the way I held open\
  \ the door? I thought.\n\n\u201CNo,\u201D I said. \u201CI\u2019m visiting for the\
  \ first time. It\u2019s a beautiful country.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, it is. Geographically\
  \ and culturally.\u201D\n\nShe went on to explain how it is encouraged to leave\
  \ babies outside in their strollers while they nap when visiting a store or restaurant.\
  \ That fresh air is good for them, and because of how low the crime rate in Iceland\
  \ is, trusting your neighbor comes easy.\n\nI chuckled. -a side effect of my culture\
  \ shock. I heard before that crime rate was low here, but I never imagined to this\
  \ degree. Coming from a country where Amber Alerts are issued, this concept was\
  \ completely foreign to me.\n\n\u201CThe police, for example, do not even carry\
  \ guns.\u201D she continued.\n\n\u201CNo guns?\u201D I thought. One of the best\
  \ countries in the world no doubt, and their law enforcement don\u2019t even carry\
  \ guns.\u201D\n\nIt spoke volumes. I couldn\u2019t resist comparing their policies\
  \ to the United States\u2019 and wondering how different things would be if my country\
  \ at least tried to follow in the steps of theirs.\nI looked over to the baby. Envying\
  \ a life where infants could nap amongst strangers, and active shooter drills didn\u2019\
  t take place in elementary schools. A nation not desensitized to a pro-slaughter\
  \ agenda.\nThe thought left me hungry for a change that I then knew was possible.\n\
  \nTwo doors were held open that day."
