Text: "\"When you have nothing you have nothing to lose\", Bob Dylan used to say...In\
  \ my case, when I had nothing I decided to travel. \n\nDuring my internship in Sydney,\
  \ Australia, I had the unfortunate of losing my job and house on the same day. And\
  \ with no place to go, I was invited by my Aussie friend to visit the east coast\
  \ town Byron Bay, located 763 km from Sydney. It was supposed to be a just road\
  \ trip to explore the beaches and relax. But it actually changed my life. \n\nThe\
  \ experience during my trip was beautiful and I could get very close to my Aussie\
  \ friend and his wife. They were both modern hippies and lived in a house in the\
  \ wild, close to the ocean. My accommodation was a big campervan and feel quite\
  \ comfortable with it. I used to wake up early every day with the birds singing\
  \ and the sunlight crossing the car's window. \n\nThe Byron Bay lifestyle enchanted\
  \ extremely me by their wildlife, the perfect waves and the healthy food. During\
  \ four days I could get involved in the local vegan-friendly community, sharing\
  \ stories and recipes like we had known each other since a long time ago. They also\
  \ tried to teach me how to surf but was a disaster, of course. Instead, we could\
  \ drive around the coast to see the dolphins and turtles. But what actually made\
  \ me feel more connected with them was the fact that they accepted me into their\
  \ lives, like a part of the family. \n\nWe visited the Natural Parks located near\
  \ Byron Bay during the day and explored a glow worm cave at night. This caves can\
  \ only be found in Australia and New Zealand. To arrive there it is necessary to\
  \ do a bushwalk at night through the Gondwana Rainforest, located in the Springbrook\
  \ National Park. Once you get there you can see the cave illuminated by breathtakingly\
  \ beautiful light that looks like the Milky Way. \n\nDuring one year living in Sydney,\
  \ I had the opportunity to visit lovely places, charming beaches and mountains,\
  \ but was only in Byron Bay that I could feel the local connection. It happens when\
  \ we open ourselves to the new, in order to exchange knowledge, when we listen to\
  \ locals stories, visit their city not only as tourists but also as humans who respect\
  \ the local culture. \n\n But what happened after Byron Bay? I find a new house\
  \ and job in Sydney. My Aussie friend, who was also unemployed, got a job in Sydney\
  \ too. I could finally retribute the amazing hosting experience, by cooking vegan\
  \ meals, introducing him to my Brazilian friends and teaching him Portuguese."
