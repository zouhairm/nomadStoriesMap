Text: "To hear him say it seems like I was there. \"The night was black as ink\",\
  \ he said; \"the rain descended as if some dam in the heavens had broken free; thunder\
  \ rent the angry clouds like explosion of dynamites. Chain lightning showed electric\
  \ poles falling around, the noise of it, nearly deafening. Finally, a crash more\
  \ terrific, more terrible, than any, the mortal man has ever heard, brought me to\
  \ my knees.\" Though he was not a praying man, on his knees he wailed, \"Oh Lord,\
  \ if it is thy will, let this cup pass over me.\"\n\nI have seen it in photos, and\
  \ through books, I've been to \"the end of the world\" and backimmersed in the eclectic\
  \ blend of Latin and European culture, sailed through the Atlantic coastlines and\
  \ shimmering lakes, visited the vineyards of Mendoza and explored the scenic surroundings\
  \ of the leafy boulevards, snow-capped mountains, elegant architectures and the\
  \ delights of the Pampas.\n\nOh, the awe inspiring Iguazu Falls\"poor Niagara\"\
  \ is nothing to be compared to its stunning and magnificent display of nature. Ah,\
  \ the steaks, most delicious and succulent. Tasty!\n\nIn my wildest dreams, I've\
  \ always longed to bask in the romance and opportunity of the \"silvery one.\" A\
  \ cocktail of wanderlust. The birthplace of tango. The Shangri La of South America.\
  \ The home of festivals, f\xFAtbol, gaucho culture, striking mountains and beautiful\
  \ landscapes. Oh Argentina, when shall I see thee?\n\nBut John my neighbor sensationally\
  \ smothered my dreams. He had just returned from La Plata in Argentina. And as he\
  \ shared his experience of the April 2013 rainfall with me, cold chills ran through\
  \ my veins. I felt John was armed with pins, and, bang! bang! bang!, he was bursting\
  \ my balloons. My balloons of hope and dreams of a life time adventure. Honestly,\
  \ it was the last thing I expected.\n\n\"In 12 hours it rained what it normally\
  \ rains in the entire month of April.\" The city was almost crippled. Flash floods\
  \ and widespread power outages. People waited for hours for rescue on trees and\
  \ on roof tops of flooded homes. Dozens of victims lost their lives by drowning,\
  \ while others were electrocuted by fallen power lines. Three days of national mourning\
  \ was declared. Alas, \"a catastrophe without precedent\"! \n\nBut Argentina does\
  \ not have a monopoly of the devastating effect of climate change and the absence\
  \ of drainage works. Other nations of the world have their own fair share. It's\
  \ been five years since. How I wish things have changed."
