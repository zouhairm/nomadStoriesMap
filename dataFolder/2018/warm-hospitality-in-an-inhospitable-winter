Text: "Crunching through knee-deep, dazzlingly white snow, I\u2019m trying to keep\
  \ up with my three children as they advance down the hill-side and approach the\
  \ Skelleftea River in northern-Sweden.\n\nDespite having an old friend and local\
  \ guide, Anders, leading our way, my mother\u2019s brain is going into overdrive,\
  \ assessing the dangers of thin ice, a gushing river of icy cold water and the concern\
  \ that someone could wander off as we weave our way through the tall pine trees\
  \ in this vast wilderness.\n\nSuddenly, my kids stop, excitedly pointing to some\
  \ footprints they\u2019ve spied in the snow. Anders confirms they were made by a\
  \ moose, and if we are lucky, we just might see one. I hurry to catch up and mentally\
  \ add being charged by a moose to my tally of mother worries.\n\nThe feeble winter\
  \ sun, masked by thick white clouds, has not been up for long. The landscape looks\
  \ like a black and white filter has been applied to it \u2013 the trees and water\
  \ are shades of deep grey, with the only contrasting colour being the pure white\
  \ of the snow-drenched countryside.\n\nWe\u2019re now at the bank of the river,\
  \ and the kids are daring each other to take off their two layers of gloves and\
  \ test the temperature of the water. Anders explains that the water in this area\
  \ is pure enough to drink, thanks to the lack of urban development, and the natural\
  \ filtration system provided by the surrounding mountains.\n\nI begin to relax,\
  \ and pick up a rock to skim over the river. Once, twice, three times the stone\
  \ hops across the opaque water. The ripples widen and then disperse. The kids begin\
  \ scrabbling for skimmer rocks of their own, while Anders lowers some strong-smelling\
  \ Swedish sausage into the water, in the hopes of luring a crayfish.\n\nWe don\u2019\
  t spot a moose, and there\u2019s no crayfish biting today, so we turn back the way\
  \ we came, sinking into our original footprints, like Hansel and Gretel following\
  \ the scattered bread crumbs.\n\nBack in the township of Skelleftea, the red and\
  \ yellow barn-like houses rise out of the snow, appearing as beacons of warmth and\
  \ light, places where you can be greeted within by a roaring fire, a hot chocolate\
  \ or blueberry soup, and the often reserved but earnest hospitality of the northern-Swedish\
  \ people.\n\nAnders beckons us inside his home. We duck under the jagged icicles\
  \ that hang over the front door, and step into the warmth of his cottage, suddenly\
  \ aware of how numb our hands and feet have become. And yet, our hearts are warm."
