Text: "It almost doesn\u2019t seem real. Sleep\u2019s rubbing at the corner of my\
  \ eyes, pink skies are drawing the sun into the river\u2019s reflection and she\u2019\
  s staring at me dead on, unmistakably so. \n\nI\u2019ve spent the last two hours\
  \ sleeping on the flannel of a stranger\u2019s shoulder, awkwardly sat on one of\
  \ the old car seats scattered across the wooden slow boat whilst the world carries\
  \ on as we\u2019re in this vortex of stillness. My mind is still hazy and nothing\
  \ feels exactly as it is, but I can make her out clearly. She\u2019s stood in the\
  \ doorway of one of the turquoise boats, plants at her feet and arms crossed over\
  \ her chest. More out of habit than anything else, I halfheartedly smile at her\
  \ as I swing my backpack over my shoulders and gather my belongings. She doesn\u2019\
  t smile back.\n\nA local taps my shoulder and invites me to his bar that evening.\
  \ Before I can even form a response, he rushes onto the next person. She still stares.\
  \ \n\nThis is what she now knows; watching travellers invade the tiny riverside\
  \ town of Pakbeng for a night before re-boarding the boat to carry them further\
  \ down the Mekong to Luang Prabang. Turning from her, I watch people head up the\
  \ banks of the river towards the scattering of guesthouses and local restaurants,\
  \ claiming their place for the night. As I shut my eyes, I try to imagine this place\
  \ five, ten years ago; before Laos was on everyone\u2019s travel list. Before the\
  \ need for homestays and cheap tourist bars. Before the slow boat would dump tourists\
  \ on the town every night. Before us. Before it was more than it is; when it was\
  \ just Pakbeng.\n\nI can and I can\u2019t. If I close my eyes, I can erase what\
  \ I see in front of me, but I can\u2019t modify it. The river reflects the orange\
  \ sun as it sets; locals still sit between the scattering of rocks along the edge.\
  \ But my mind can\u2019t comprehend what this town was before tourism arrived and\
  \ the ways we must have changed this community. And it hurts. Somewhere inside of\
  \ me, my heart aches for her and for this town. I couldn\u2019t imagine my hometown\
  \ any way other than it is. I don\u2019t think I want to. We have a responsibility\
  \ as travellers, and we so often get caught up in the whirlwind of it all that we\
  \ forget to stop, breathe and realise that these are peoples' lives and communities\
  \ and cultures we often entrench on.\n\nSo I turn back, catch her eyes, and with\
  \ a sad smile on my face, I nod my head at her in acknowledgement. She smiles back.\
  \ No words are said; none are needed.\n\nAnd it almost doesn\u2019t seem real. Except\
  \ that it is."
