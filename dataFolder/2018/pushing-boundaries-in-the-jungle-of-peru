Text: "I spent six days in Puerto Maldonado, Peru. I was staying in some jungle hostel\
  \ with no windows, only nets against mosquitos. A young gorgeous Amazonian girl\
  \ and her friendly boyfriend were drawing a mural of Bob Marley, birds and insects\
  \ were chirping, my body, that is made to survive up to -25\xB0 C of cold during\
  \ Lithuanian winters, was hardly sweating and getting ready for the \u2018spiritual\u2019\
  \ ritual in the hut of the 90-year-old shaman deep in the village surrounded by\
  \ palm-trees and other widespread trees and bushes where a small kitten was jumping\
  \ in the mud and some chickens were hanging around. For my big touristic surprise,\
  \ the shaman was nothing like the \u201Ctypical\u201D Indian wearing a feather crown\
  \ and leather accessories, but just a regular villager with shorts and a dirty tee-shirt,\
  \ holding a plastic bottle of Ayahuasca drink.\nSo, one of those nights I came to\
  \ the shaman, together with the Spanish guy that I met in the hostel. We had different\
  \ reasons to travel through our inner worlds, so our trips were very different.\
  \ While he was fluttering in the air with his huge smile seeing colors and flowers,\
  \ I was meeting my inner demons, as I call it. The confrontation with myself kind\
  \ of reminded me of the horror version of the Alice in Wonderland with a thousand\
  \ more details. It was a scary trip, since I was there alone with unknown people,\
  \ having a very strange experience, surrounded by the blind darkness and cockroaches\
  \ promenading by me, but once I woke up, I knew that there is nothing in life I\
  \ should be scared of anymore. It felt like I was on the very edge of everything,\
  \ my security, my life, my thoughts, my inner boundaries, my fears and my strength.\n\
  I don\u2019t know if that had any influence, but the next day, during the trip through\
  \ the jungle, I did something that was unexpected to myself. I encouraged the guide\
  \ and the Dutch guy to go swimming in the lake, full of caimans, piranhas and anacondas.\
  \ It was raining cats and dogs. The line, where the drops were hitting the surface\
  \ of the lake and jumping up, was bright white with a bit of foamy blur around it.\
  \ It was the most magical experience. The rain, the heat, the calmness and the sounds\
  \ of the jungle, along with the feeling of revival, merged me with that white line.\
  \ While I was swimming in the lake, I knew there are piranhas and caimans around,\
  \ but I sort of ignored the existence of anacondas. Luckily, I only saw one later,\
  \ when I was already on the boat. It was as thick as my arm and extremely scary."
