Text: "Had a lazy Sunday already, sans any activity, and I wilted at the mere thought\
  \ of how mundane the upcoming weekdays would be.\n\nThe clock ticked past two. I\
  \ knew it was time for bed. But my soul didn\u2019t. Thoughts kept lurking in my\
  \ mind. I was desperate to travel. Not necessarily somewhere less visited or one\
  \ that entices adventure seekers. A simple beach or a countryside setting would\
  \ be enough to rejuvenate and pacify my restless, eighteen year old soul.\n\nI had\
  \ already been chiding myself for having cancelled two trips prior to this- a duo\
  \ bicycle ride to Puri and a solo trek in the Himalayas. I knew I shouldn\u2019\
  t succumb to these negative outcomes. \n\nSoon I found myself stuffing all the essentials\
  \ into my waist pouch for the one day trip to Puri. My half-asleep sister, not able\
  \ to decide if she should disrupt the plan herself or wake up someone else, finally\
  \ bolted the door as I left my house, all pumped up, at 3:30 am.\n\nThe connecting\
  \ train from my hometown was just before dawn. I took the earliest train leaving\
  \ Howrah at six. Holding an unreserved ticket and getting a seat for the nine hour\
  \ journey was a matter of high fortune. The train took long halts and had a delayed\
  \ arrival. A short bus ride; and I could hear the startling sound of the lapping\
  \ waves.\n\nThe gushing waves and the sense of playfulness it instilled in me while\
  \ I let the water reach my feet and recede was something I had been fantasizing\
  \ to live for a very long time. I stood on the soothing sand which was gradually\
  \ being washed off by the invading waves; recalled the sudden planning and the journey.\
  \ I didn\u2019t know this would actually happen. Last night, as I was aimlessly\
  \ messaging my friends, little did I expect being welcomed by the warmth of the\
  \ beach the very next afternoon.\n\nHardly had I delved into the pleasure of enjoying\
  \ how the ocean juxtaposes serenity and aggression when the sun finally called it\
  \ a day. I quickly headed towards the Rath Yatra. It wasn\u2019t long before I came\
  \ back for an evening stroll on the sand. Oblivious to time, my soul continued cherishing\
  \ everything that happened around.\n\nThe overnight return journey was not mollifying\
  \ like the sand but indeed special. I was taking back memories from my first solo\
  \ trip which I would later reminisce on. The eventful train journeys, the spontaneity\
  \ and the baffling festival crowd- there was plenty to gossip. But grandma was more\
  \ interested in the finances. I calculated. 550 INR it was.\n\n\u201CThat\u2019\
