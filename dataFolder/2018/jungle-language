Text: "The water was cool, a welcome relief from the warm, heavy jungle air. I watched\
  \ it part in ripples round my ankles, as I stepped gingerly, bare-toed and unbalanced,\
  \ into the muddy river bed of the Amazon. \n\nI had arrived 2 days earlier, backpack\
  \ and rubber boots in hand. Travelling by what can only be described as a toy plane,\
  \ I was plonked somewhere in the green depths of the Ecuadorian Amazon. Thankfully,\
  \ a group of indigenous tribes-people\u200A - \u200Athe Waorani\u200A - \u200Awere\
  \ waiting as I touched down. They welcomed me with dancing, singing, and generous\
  \ smears of sticky red achiote seed dye across my cheeks.  \n\nOn this third day,\
  \ having hiked 6 hours so far through thick undergrowth and endless mud, I was ready\
  \ to bathe quietly in the bright, clear water of the river. I stripped down and\
  \ stepped in, wincing as my bare, tender feet found the hidden pebbles of the river\
  \ bed. I was knee-deep when the current picked up, and my already graceless stance\
  \ became a wild flail. With wide eyes, and arms every which way, my hands reached\
  \ out to grab onto thin air. \n\nI heard a giggle nearby and looked up. A girl my\
  \ age was sitting on a rock nearby and observing my inelegant attempts to make my\
  \ way into the river. In that moment, I saw myself through her eyes - which were\
  \ kind and open, utterly without malice. I accepted her wordless invitation to forgo\
  \ embarrassment, and quickly abandoned my failing efforts to stay upright as the\
  \ two of us collapsed in fits of laughter. \n\nMy knowledge of the Wao language\
  \ being, regrettably, limited, we attempted small talk in broken Spanish - was I\
  \ married? No. Did she have children? Yes, two - but we saw more of each other in\
  \ that splashing moment of joyful unselfconsciousness than any conversation could\
  \ show us.\n\nLater, we cooked a fish I\u2019d caught. She showed me how to scale\
  \ it, cut it, and turn it over the flame, just so. Her hands told me what her words\
  \ could not. The fish tasted of mud, and sun, and the greenness that is held, it\
  \ seems, in everything the jungle touches. We ate together without speaking - enjoying\
  \ the same food, the same hot, heavy air, the same orchestra of dusk-dwelling birds\
  \ and insects.\n\nI think of her now when I glance around a London tube carriage,\
  \ filled with expressionless, downcast faces and suspicious side-glances. Her fullness\
  \ - her beaming openness - surprised me out of my own city-shy reticence, and gave\
  \ voice to the silent kind of understanding that can, if we let it, exist between\
  \ any two humans."
