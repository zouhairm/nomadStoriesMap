Text: "Taiwan. Inconspicuous. Tiny. A freckle on the face of Asia sitting on the Tropic\
  \ of Cancer in the Pacific Ocean. Taiwan is a crucible of cultures, culminating\
  \ in a society of quiet daredevils unafraid to look hazard in the eye. \n\nThe sunshine\
  \ was a startling departure from the usual February sky. I had come to celebrate\
  \ the most important holiday of the year, the Lunar New Year, with my friend\u2019\
  s family. Lunar New Year, or Spring Festival, is a celebration throughout Asia.\
  \ It\u2019s a feast of insane proportions, difficult to tell where one meal begins\
  \ and the next ends. Red couplet poems are hung on doorways. Homes are meticulously\
  \ cleaned in preparation to bring in the new and leave behind the old and the dirty.\
  \ \n\nHualien is an unassuming town located to the south of Taipei. It had just\
  \ endured a massive 6.7 earthquake, among numerous aftershocks. Pieces of earth\
  \ jutted out from mountain roads like broken pieces of glass. Buildings had collapsed\
  \ into 45 degree angles. But, Hualien locals had yet to be shaken.\n\nThe second\
  \ night of the festival, I sat in the backseat of a car having little understanding\
  \ of what was next on the agenda struggling to decipher conversation with my limited\
  \ Mandarin. I hung in limbo, as any outsider does, waiting for the next clue of\
  \ what was to come as the sun rapidly disappeared over the palm trees. My friend\u2019\
  s uncle sat in the driver\u2019s seat and slurred something in a deep, timbered\
  \ voice. \u201CFireworks,\u201D my friend whispered.\n\nIn the steamy, warm winter\
  \ night overlooking the thick greenery abutting the ocean, we arranged the bottle\
  \ rockets to prepare them for flight. A few took off a few seconds after lighting.\
  \ The rhythm of the explosives became imprinted in our brains. This made it all\
  \ the more shocking when the two of us realized the rockets we had just lit had\
  \ not zipped into the sky. There were only a few seconds to take cover before they\
  \ exploded. Few things bring transcendence equal to looking into someone\u2019s\
  \ eyes as we both realized that the bottle rocket, in all probability, would explode\
  \ in front of our eyes at any second. \n\nWe clumsily pulled each other away from\
  \ the impending explosion and laughed hysterically as if we were laughing in the\
  \ face of our own fragility. We were almost kids again, but the joy of knowing the\
  \ danger invigorated us in a way that childhood ignorance never could. Together,\
  \ we had experienced the coming of a new year, a new risk, and another opportunity\
  \ to stare into the eyes of the unexpected."
