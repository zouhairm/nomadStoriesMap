Text: "I was so fearful of something going terribly wrong during my travels that before\
  \ I embarked on my solo backpacking adventure through Europe, I tried to plan out\
  \ every detail to absolute perfection. I planned the route, set myself a daily budget,\
  \ extensively researched hostels and I even tried to study the public transport\
  \ maps of the cities I was visiting. Embarrassingly, the first thing I realized\
  \ when I arrived in Prague was how useless all of my planning had been. The exact\
  \ moment it dawned on me was when I found myself traipsing up and down some unknown\
  \ street in Prague, completely lost and at my wits end. The minute I arrived in\
  \ the Czech Republic my phone ceased to be of any use to me. I couldn\u2019t call\
  \ anyone for help, I couldn\u2019t look anything up online, and I had no idea how\
  \ to find the hostel I was meant to be staying at. To top it all off, I had stupidly\
  \ made the decision to backpack with a massive duffel bag. It felt as though I was\
  \ carrying the weight of all my failure in that duffel bag. The burn marks on my\
  \ shoulders served only as my punishment for being so ridiculously clueless. \n\n\
  I had wanted to go to Prague for as long as I can remember. My Uncle is an artist\
  \ and he once spoke to me of how inspired the city had made him feel. I remember\
  \ gazing longingly at a painting he had done of Charles Bridge and thinking to myself\
  \ that one day, it will be me standing there on that bridge.\nI threw my bag on\
  \ the floor and plonked myself on it trying desperately not to cry. I sat there\
  \ looking out at the beautiful city before me; with its narrow-cobbled stone streets\
  \ and breath-taking Gothic architecture; I asked myself for the 100th time that\
  \ afternoon, just what had I been thinking? How could I possibly have thought I\
  \ could do this on my own? I should have never left the safety of my home, and I\
  \ definitely should have invested in a more comfortable backpack. \n\nSuddenly,\
  \ I remembered a brief conversation I had with a fellow traveller. She told me that\
  \ google maps still works if you have no network on your phone. Holding my breath\
  \ and praying to the universe to have mercy I turned on my location, opened google\
  \ maps and stared at my screen. I have never been more relieved in my life as I\
  \ was in that moment when that beautiful blue dot appeared. I was saved! My decision\
  \ to travel solo pushed me over the edge because it challenged me, and it proved\
  \ to me that although I may have terrible taste in luggage, I was just as independent\
  \ and capable as I had always believed myself to be."
