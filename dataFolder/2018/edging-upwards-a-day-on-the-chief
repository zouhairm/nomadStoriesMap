Text: "We left the gravel road after 9am - late, considering how far we had to climb.\
  \ It was a battle through the dark, sloping forest with our heavy rucksacks and\
  \ our feet were damp in our socks from fording streams by the time we reached the\
  \ base of The Chief. For some reason I had decided Canada\u2019s celebrated 700m\
  \ granite dome would be a good introduction to \u2018multipitch\u2019 rock climbing.\
  \ It loomed over us, the shrubs clinging to its face no more significant than algae\
  \ on some great sea creature. \n\nWe began to climb and were soon above the swaying\
  \ pine tops. The rough granite and sharp pieces of gear were already leaving their\
  \ red marks on my hands; a necessary sacrifice to the mountain. We climbed into\
  \ the sunlight and the rock was hot against my cheek as I balanced on each tiny\
  \ hold, my world reduced to that within reach of my sweaty fingers. \n\nOccasionally,\
  \ with a dizzying shift in perspective, I could turn. Howe Sound\u2019s sparklingly\
  \ water peppered by dark islands stretched from the town of Squamish to the distant\
  \ ocean. Endless snow-capped mountains, vast yet dwarfed by perspective, stood resolute\
  \ beyond. I pitied the stuffy passengers in their bug-like cars below. We were clinging\
  \ to the edge of a giant tank in which eagles larger than any back home soared,\
  \ their cries mocking the interlopers in their world who inched painfully higher.\
  \ Each item we carried seemed poised to jump gleefully back to the safety of the\
  \ earth. Squashed sandwiches and slippery sun cream were gripped with such ferocity\
  \ it weakened our already tiring muscles. We climbed past flora contorted by their\
  \ own balancing act and along a spine of rock which dropped away on both sides to\
  \ the forest far below.\n\nOur late start and my inexperience had slowed us and\
  \ the calls of fellow adventurers above faded. The sun retreated, and cold shadows\
  \ emerged like winged beasts from every recess.  Small talk was left at pitch 14\
  \ when my nervous chat was met with a tense\n\n\u2018Shut up and keep climbing\u2019\
  \n\nOur eyes struggled to pick out holds in the flat light. Our twitching muscles\
  \ screamed their exhaustion. Darkness fell. The final pitch was a wriggle up though\
  \ a large crack. My rucksack caught, I fumbled the best hold in the blackness and\
  \ then I was lying flat beneath the starry sky, 13 hours after my feet had left\
  \ the rich earth. This was life on the edge, and it was brilliant, but perhaps there\
  \ was an element of relief as our quivering legs hit the solid trail down. Not that\
  \ either of us would admit it."
