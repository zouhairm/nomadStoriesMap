Text: "It was about 6AM when my family and I arrived at the Na Pali Coast Kayak Tour\
  \ departure point on Kee Beach, located on the north face of Hawaii\u2019s verdant\
  \ island, Kauai. Saturated in the half light of pacific mornings and guided equally\
  \ by the boisterous voices of our two guides and the crashing waves of the ocean,\
  \ we tumbled out of the van onto the sand. It was this trip that pushed us all to\
  \ the edge. \n None of us were prepared for the trial that was getting these ruddered\
  \ seafaring beasts into the water. I\u2019d compare the effort to rescuing a beached\
  \ whale. Despite the doubt that had wriggled into our hearts, the majesty of the\
  \ coastline was already making the effort worth it. Emerald cliffs wove in and out\
  \ of Hawaii\u2019s famously translucent coast like a giant had messily sown earth\
  \ and water together, and silhouettes of other islands were slowly appearing through\
  \ the mist. \nOur two sun-baked guides (one with a belly like a personal floatation\
  \ device, the other comprised of dehydrated sinew) wasted no time in getting the\
  \ oceanic show on the salty road. The adventure soon became an effort in multitasking,\
  \ as managing the rudder, keeping your strokes consistent, and sneaking glances\
  \ at the lush cliffs took all of one\u2019s attention. \nOur first stop came after\
  \ our guides took us through a tunnel which led out into a spherical hole with walls\
  \ about 100 feet high. Shattering the reverie our bulky guide dove into the water\
  \ and came back up holding a limpet. Shucking it with a practiced hand he tossed\
  \ it to me and said, \u201CEat it.\u201D I slurped the limpet down (which actually\
  \ tasted pretty good from the natural salt)  and whilst in the act of chewing my\
  \ guide cheerily informed me, \u201CMake sure you chew it good or else it\u2019\
  ll latch onto your throat.\u201D I chewed the poor thing to a pulp. \nIt was three\
  \ hours, multiple caves, and two sea turtles later that we took our first actual\
  \ rest, pulling the kayaks ashore in a small cove. The exhaustion was intense, and\
  \ our arms had trouble moving the homemade sandwiches up to our mouths. Our group\
  \ was passed out like rocks. Too soon after arriving we set out again, passing cheerfully\
  \ waving tourists in speedboats taking a very different tour of the Na Pali coast.\
  \ Our sweat-soaked faces did nothing to hide our envy. \nIt was a straight shot\
  \ to the end of the adventure, where we were promised our guide\u2019s homegrown\
  \ mangos. When we finally spotted the far shore, my arms and I almost wept with\
  \ relief. That mango was the best thing I had ever tasted."
