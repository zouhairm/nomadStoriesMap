Text: "Sun is setting with a partial view of Bandra - Worli Sea link, Mumbai. I stuff\
  \ the remaining half Vada Pav into my mouth and take out my mobile phone to find\
  \ ten missed calls from Mom, ignoring I find the camera thumbnail to capture the\
  \ frame, find a bench to grasp the view one last time before I leave the city. \n\
  \nA man of my father's age, clean shaved and dressed in brand new old-fashioned\
  \ clothes leaned his back on a street light post, stared the sea link with a wrinkled\
  \ forehead, scratched his hair while turning to the honking traffic sideways and\
  \ gazed the skyscrapers across on the horizon that will start glittering with the\
  \ dusk. Something told me, he felt lost in the chaos. He was not overwhelmed. I\
  \ went up to ask if I could help him in any way. \n\nHe stared again. Pointing towards\
  \ my phone, he asked how to use the box. Where was the road on the sea heading to?\
  \ What is the wire \u2013 like strings hanging in everyone\u2019s ears? Higher the\
  \ heights of buildings, wider the spans of slums. Why are people not talking enough\
  \ with each other? Why is no one keeping an eye on everyone? The city is dotted\
  \ with ugly hoardings. Has every road been tarred and every footpath been paved?\
  \  How much should one earn to live here? \n\nLife was ahead of Doordarshan that\
  \ he had watched every Sunday. Getting a chance to play carom board was always a\
  \ treat. Getting back to the room by sunset was a rule. Leaving the room at sharp\
  \ 7 in the morning was awaited whole night. He loved helping with Kitchen chores\
  \ there that served 900 people. That had made him feel responsible and proud. At\
  \ this point, he fidgeted. A lady behind was shouting at a street side vendor selling\
  \ balloons. He wanted to say more but stopped. But then he continued.\n\nUnlike\
  \ others, he never had visitors who would tell stories from outside. He had lived\
  \ the same life every single day. He worried how time had stopped for him for 22\
  \ years straight.\n\nHe missed his tiny Home and the high walled sunset from his\
  \ window. He missed the routine breakfast, lunch, and dinner provided to him. He\
  \ missed how he never had to think of his survival. He smiled on forgetting to recall\
  \ his name at once but he remembered the number. He missed the vertical grills fitted\
  \ in windows where he used to sandwich his face between the rods and dream. He had\
  \ found his freedom in the constraints. Now, he wished to be in no other place but\
  \ that room that had seen his every emotion and every trick to escape.\n\n\nSomething\
  \ told me his home was a PRISON."
