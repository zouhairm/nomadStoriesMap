Text: "\u201C\xBFPuedes limpiar esta mesa por favor?\u201D\nI peer up through the\
  \ fingers of my hand held to shade my eyes. Between rays, I find the soft tica voice;\
  \ Pam grins beside a cluttered picnic table. My salt-waterlogged brain is slow to\
  \ process her request, but I quickly prop up my bones to help. She wipes the tabletop\
  \ and places a bud vase of ivory orchids at its center.\nMy muscles protest the\
  \ sudden movement\u2014understandably so. After a day of surfing at Playa Grande,\
  \ they\u2019ve carried my board a mile along the shore, across a crocodile-infested\
  \ estuary, and to siesta at Playa Tamarindo. I stretch and survey the scene. Wooden\
  \ chairs positioned in view of an arbor overlook the receding tide and emerald wilds\
  \ of the jungle. A white surfboard erected in the sand is inscribed with a brush\
  \ dipped deep in the ocean palette: \u201CLindsay & Ricardo.\u201D\nAs I pull at\
  \ my body\u2019s seams, fireworks spider across the sky, beckoning guests to their\
  \ seats. The blasts send a dog running, leaving the distressed cries of its elderly\
  \ owner in its wake. I sprint after the frantic canine careening towards the road,\
  \ and shout ahead to two ticos selling coconut oil at the roadside. They stop the\
  \ vehicles and help me corral the animal. \nWhen reunited with her pup, language\
  \ is no barrier; gratitude is etched on her face, joy spilling from her tearful\
  \ eyes. Her hand grips mine, leaking pura vida. The surreal warmth of it lingers,\
  \ following me home to Toronto, Canada, two days later.\nMy flight lands. Within\
  \ hours, my dad, Papa Rut, is having a heart attack. Here I sit in the cardiac ward,\
  \ my hand now gripping his, post-emergency coronary angioplasty. The ocean is still\
  \ in my hair and the sand still between my toes. Snow silently, violently whips\
  \ at the window. What beautiful chaos.\nA stretcher rolls in helmed by Jenny the\
  \ paramedic, whom I met 15 days ago in the seat beside me on my flight to Liberia,\
  \ Costa Rica. After she tends to her patient, I approach. Bewildered and in awe,\
  \ we embrace, compare trip notes, and marvel at the common threads exposed. \nNow\
  \ stable, Papa Rut is moved to a local hospital. We\u2019re met by family friend\
  \ and staff member, Leslie, who says her coworker, Alex, also just returned from\
  \ Costa Rica. Minutes later, I\u2019m shaking Alex\u2019s hand in the cafeteria.\
  \ Upon asking about his travels, he lights up and recounts his past three weeks:\
  \ daily surfing, including a sunrise session on the morning of his sister\u2019\
  s wedding, for which he\u2019d painted a surfboard.\nI smile. \u201CIs her name\
  \ Lindsay?\u201D"
