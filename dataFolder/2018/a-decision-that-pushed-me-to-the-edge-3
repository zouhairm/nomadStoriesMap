Text: "A decision that pushed me to the edge\u2026\nWritten by Christina Summers\n\
  \nWhere does one begin to tell the story of where the edge began\u2026. 21 years\
  \ ago, is a good start.\nI was 20 years old when I gave birth to my son. He was\
  \ the best thing that had ever happened to me. I worked very hard doing difficult\
  \ jobs to barely scrape by every month as a single mother. For many years my son\
  \ and I were very lucky to have the love and support of my family to help out with\
  \ the daily duties of life when I was at work. It does take a village to raise a\
  \ child. .\n\nAt 29, unexpectedly I met the most amazing man. Our fairytale did\
  \ come with a few hiccups, but because there was so much love, we persevered and\
  \ married 3 years after we met. I was very lucky to gain an amazingly gifted stepson\
  \ through this union. Now, I had 2 boys whom I could love unconditionally.\n\nFast\
  \ forward to late 2016, when my family was torn apart. The life we built; was built\
  \ on sand, not concrete. It was a very painful realization. I left my husband and\
  \ filed for a legal separation.\n\nIn Oct of 2016, I realized that I had slowly\
  \ become a shell of the person I once was prior to meeting my husband. Personally,\
  \ I had lost myself so gradually over the years fulfilling these other roles; I\
  \ did not have anything left for me. I just spent the past year and a half trying\
  \ to put the pieces back together of my broken heart. Might I say it was not an\
  \ easy task.\n\nI had never booked a ticket for a plane ride for myself in 10 years,\
  \ let alone a whole vacation. In Nov of 2016, I booked my first solo trip to Cancun.\
  \ Immersing myself into the local culture and learning the language has become very\
  \ gratifying for me. I am a bold woman with a heart of gold and the soul of a warrior.\
  \ Being in a foreign land allows you to really test your personal strength and power.\n\
  \nTwenty years ago if you told me I would be living in Winnipeg, a mom to two grown\
  \ men, writing a short story for a chance to travel write in Argentina. I would\
  \ have laughed, but yet here I am doing that very thing. I am a creative mind, a\
  \ soul full of love, with an incredible sense of what is beautiful. The ability\
  \ and intellect to decipher it all; then put it into an article that would allow\
  \ the reader to believe he or she was right there along with me on the vacation.\
  \ I have been doing this in my own way when blogging about my trips on Instagram.\
  \ I allow people to come on vacation with me and to experience all the wonderful\
  \ things about the resorts I travel to."
