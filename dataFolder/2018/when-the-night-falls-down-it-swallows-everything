Text: "You need to wait for Thursdays, find the cargo ship leaving from Buenaventura\
  \ that will take you to Bahia Solano city in 24 hours. Otherwise, twice a week,\
  \ a small plane flies from Medellin and picks you there, offering mountains and\
  \ jungle rooted in red soil. Bahia Solano is a crossroad town where houses spread\
  \ out : we are in the wettest region of America. The rain dictates day-to-day life.\
  \ Landslides kill hundreds of human beings and animals every year, constantly sculpting\
  \ the territory. The government does not watch. Men and dogs, backs on the jungle\
  \ and faces to the Pacific, travel by motorcycle or boat. Huina is one of the nearby\
  \ town : an atiendita as a single business, a hotel where three French people slum\
  \ it with bottles of rum, Diego the sailor, and a school. Children \u2014 varnished\
  \ shoes, ironed uniform\u2014 stand out in this raw landscape doomed to the mud\
  \ by centuries of storms. A bakery is embedded in the mangrove, a mustachio old\
  \ Spanish-looking man has the only coin-operated telephone able to join the outside\
  \ world. No internet. The immoderation of a world without its usual noises. A population\
  \ of afro-descendants and natives is concentrated here, keeping churches, alabaos,\
  \ and beliefs for themselves \u2014 inventing entire worlds within their own hands.\
  \ Their exiles are so old that only the music remains. Arms are not \"productive\"\
  , but dreams have memories. When the night falls down, it swallows everything, clearing\
  \ its throat ; only the crabs remain. One of those night, we met Diego. A long time\
  \ ago cocaine took men hostage : the ruins of Escobar's times are hidden all around.\
  \ We won\u2019t miss those stilt palaces, walls oozing off dead paint. Corpses of\
  \ plastic items, left-overs of an air-conditioned kitchen, a broken roof. Thousand\
  \ of hermit crabs reign as kings ; the bats are waiting for their turn in the silent\
  \ rooms. \"We don\u2019t want a road network from Medellin: it would promote traffic\
  \ and large industries\", explains Diego. \"Because of drugs, industrial fishing\
  \ is prohibited : at least our ocean is alive ;  humpback whales come here to mate,\
  \ more than elsewhere\". We\u2019ll sleep on the sailor\u2019s terrace. A rumor\
  \ in town says he guaranteed prosperity to the entire beach the day he dug up 1000\
  \ kg of cocaine from the Pacific, and shared the gains with he whole population\
  \ of Huina... Who cares for the truth ? The night opens its fingers, mixes the ocean\
  \ with the river. Planktons glow like underwater fireflies... It\u2019s their own\
  \ way of dying, some may say."
