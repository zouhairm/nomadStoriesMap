Text: "In my life, everyone seems superficial. When I make decisions, I don\u2019\
  t know if I really decided or if the expectations of others pushed me to make that\
  \ decision. \nMy confidence is like the daylight. Sometimes it\u2019s there, strong\
  \ and energetic. Other times I only doubt myself and can\u2019t even remember when\
  \ I felt good about me as a person the last time.\nDecisions are hard to make. Especially\
  \ if they decide over what you are going to do your whole life. I have been too\
  \ insecure to chose a major, job or even a life goal.\n\nEven though everything\
  \ needs to be planned, in order for me to relax, I decided to go on a journey that\
  \ takes me nowhere. \n\nHiking though Patagonia- where doubts can endanger you more\
  \ than in the normal, superficial, arrogant society. \nYoung adults have other problems\
  \ too. I remember how my grandma always used to talk about \u201Cthe good old times\u201D\
  . People were less sensible, didn\u2019t have mental problems& did not lack confidence.\
  \ Sensitivity is something I experience during some painful experiences- like falling\
  \ down a hill or tripping over rocks. Gashes and scrapes make me cringe. \nSoon\
  \ I begin to realize that what is really hurting is my self-consciousness. Fuck\
  \ the others that doubt you! I was the one that doubted myself the most. They keep\
  \ their chins up like royals, but mine is higher at the moment, because I made it\
  \ to the top of the Cerro Torre."
