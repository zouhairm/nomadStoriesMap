Text: "The sun shone bold and bright across Grundy Lake, casting shadows beneath trees\
  \ that danced with the wind. It was early morning, but I was lively and eager to\
  \ visit the cliffs. Other campers in the park were groggily pushing their tent flaps\
  \ open, slowly collecting themselves for the day.\nMy friends and I hustled through\
  \ the narrow path towards the cliffs, backpacks slung over our shoulders and feet\
  \ bare. We came to a clearing of rock, with a tree growing at an implausible angle\
  \ over the lake. I awed at nature\u2019s extreme tenacity to create and sustain\
  \ life.\nThe lake was dark, almost unwelcoming. But the sun challenged that polar\
  \ opposite. There was an equal presence of fear and fervor, aversion and appetence.\
  \ Adrenaline is what conquered.\nI jumped the smallest rock first. The brisk water\
  \ hit me fast, and when I climbed back up the rocks, the wind off the lake breathed\
  \ bitterly on my back. This didn't deter me- I headed for the next cliff, which\
  \ was a few feet taller than the last one. When I peered over the rock, however,\
  \ it seemed much higher. With unease, I braced myself, and faithfully leapt. To\
  \ my surprise, the jump was even more thrilling than the last!\nMy friends headed\
  \ over to the largest cliff, and out of curiosity, as did I.\n\"King Kong\" lived\
  \ up to its name. This massive cliff was frightening at best. A knot formed in my\
  \ throat when I saw what was below King Kong.\nThirty-five feet of nothingness,\
  \ followed by the dark, cold lake.\nOne by one, my friends and other campers hurled\
  \ themselves over the cliff. Watching them slowly dissolved my fear, but my anxiety\
  \ only worsened every time I imagined the height.\nEventually, my persistent companions\
  \ urged me to jump, offering support and encouragement. I began to feel confident.\
  \ I stepped back so that I couldn\u2019t see the bottom, and put myself in a stance.\
  \ As I deeply inhaled crisp, fresh air, my muscles became less tense. On tenterhooks\
  \ I glanced over at my friends, still enthusiastic. A sudden surge of energy and\
  \ courage shot through me. My eyes lit up with determination. I lunged forwards,\
  \ and dared not close my eyes as I soared over King Kong.\nTwo seconds. That is\
  \ how long I had been falling- but it felt like both an eternity and a fleeting\
  \ moment all at once. I surfaced to hear a crowd of people cheering for me at the\
  \ top. Overcome with gratification, I felt that in that moment, I could do anything.\n\
  The decision that quite literally pushed me to- and beyond- the edge, ended up being\
  \ oh-so-fulfilling."
