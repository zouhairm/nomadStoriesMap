Text: "\"HOOOOONK!\" They love to honk here. They honk to tell you where they are.\
  \ They honk to tell you to get out of the way. They honk for place and they honk\
  \ for space. Quite often they honk because someone else honked \u2013 a kind of\
  \ keeping up with the Joneses, with horns and hooters. They honk to exert dominance\
  \ and they honk, mostly, out of reaction. A contagious wave of Mexican honking rippling\
  \ from vehicle to vehicle. A mass migration of metallic and mechanical wildebeest\
  \ all whistling by at unnerving speeds, all part of this discordant beeping crescendo.\
  \ \n\nProblem is, I need to cross the road. \n\nThrough the hazy halitosis of the\
  \ smog and fumes I spot a gap. With a deep breath and a final prayer to any god\
  \ who may care to listen, I step onto the road in death defying docility. Now amongst\
  \ the herd of cars, trucks and bikes their horns now angrily honk at me. It feels\
  \ personal. I take it to heart. But there's no time for pity, I see the refuge of\
  \ the footpath within reach and with one desperate jump I leap to safety.  \n\n\
  The strange thing is, you get used to this chaos after a while. A few days of practise\
  \ and it becomes easy \u2013 a bit like Beirut itself. \n\nBustling Beirut is a\
  \ city at relentless rush hour. Synonymous with the horror and violence of its not\
  \ so long ago civil war, it is astonishingly energised and enigmatic. Having been\
  \ tagged the spot where East meets West, it is striking to see just how interpenetrative\
  \ all its influences are. For a city that was ravaged through culture clashes, everyone\
  \ seems to get along just fine. On Rue Hamra coffee shops are thronged with cutting\
  \ edge hipsters mingling with traditional Lebanese tradesmen. Outside as the rain\
  \ shines up the dusty path, worshippers of various faiths walk to their temples\
  \ as Muslim mosques reside happily with Christian cathedrals. Downtown, boutique\
  \ fashion stores share streets with market sellers whilst Audi's and Porsche's hug\
  \ the kerb amongst scooters and old vans. Along the Avenue de Paris fashionable\
  \ and feisty twenty-somethings stroll the promenades with burka wearing mothers,\
  \ taking a moment to catch a Mediterranean sunset and all whilst the whole town\
  \ is a constant Tower of Babel as conversations blend between French, English and\
  \ Arabic.   \n\nAs i walk through twisting lanes and alleyways, passing armed soldiers\
  \ chatting to bar-goers, it's hard not be astounded with Beirut's live-and-let-live\
  \ attitude. Enough musing though, I need to concentrate - there's a dual carriageway\
  \ coming up..."
