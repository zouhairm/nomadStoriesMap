Text: "One week before my teaching contract in China ended, my husband emailed me\
  \ a Dear John. I banged my head on the cold marble floor of the apartment, and howled.\
  \ English words I'd never taught my middle schoolers at Tongling Number 1 poured\
  \ out of my mouth. Gone was the diplomat, the role model teacher. Now it was time\
  \ to lose my mind. My upstairs neighbor came flying down our grubby stairwell, and\
  \ hammered on my door. \"Are you being murdered? What the hell is going on? Open!\
  \ Open!\" Honestly, I have no idea what she said. Like everyone in that city of\
  \ one million, she spoke no English. For the past months, whenever we'd met in the\
  \ stairwell, we'd simply smiled at each other. Even had I wanted to invite her in,\
  \ then what? My Chinese was laughable. Every time I tried to say something, I was\
  \ met with total bewilderment. In the cultural overload that is China, I'd finally\
  \ given up. I was stupid, a gaijin, always needing another teacher from the high\
  \ school to be my minder, my guide. Except it wasn't so straightforward. I'd learned\
  \ to get around perfectly well by myself. No longer did I recoil at the deep green\
  \ vegetables sold by farmers squatting in the street, knowing they'd used raw latrine\
  \ waste on their crop. I could dodge the crazy traffic coming every which way down\
  \ the street. People still stopped in front of me, open mouthed with amazement at\
  \ meeting their first westerner, and screamed HELLO!! as if speaking to some exotic\
  \ zoo escapee. It no longer bothered me. I simply stepped sideways and kept on walking.\
  \ I'd adapted, as all happy expats do.\nMy neighbor pounded on the door for an hour,\
  \ but I wouldn't obey. I was furious, as well as crazy. Mind your own goddammed\
  \ business, lady. I don't give a rat's that it's China. Go away. This westerner's\
  \ grief is personal. No audience allowed. \nShe stopped the hammering, but didn't\
  \ leave. We eyed each other through the peephole. Finally I wiped the snot off my\
  \ face and spoke in English, as evenly, as slowly as I could manage. \"I'm OK. Bad\
  \ news. From America. No murder. No bad guys. Please leave.\"\nSo, she did. She\
  \ was Chinese but she knew this foreigner was going to be OK.\nThat night, I mourned.\
  \ I sat in the dark, numb, until there were more tears left. Ahead lay the loneliest\
  \ homecoming of my life. After that, an unexpected new life, one I'd started, unplanned,\
  \ in China."
