Text: "I think I\u2019ve got away with it.\n24 hours later and I\u2019m having my\
  \ doubts about that.\nA quick consultation then I\u2019m wheeled back the way I\
  \ came, smiling awkwardly at the nurse in the slightly-too-small lift, then re-negotiating\
  \ the crowded clinic waiting room, my wheelchair skimming past a jumble of women\
  \ and babies and voices. Beige swing doors, then the x-ray room.\nBack upstairs,\
  \ I\u2019m reassured there are no fractures visible; soft tissue damage alone accounts\
  \ for my ankle being twice its usual size, for the lurid green bruising, and my\
  \ inability to put even the slightest weight on it. I\u2019m certified fit to fly\
  \ home from Yangon later that day and kitted out with crutches.\nA concerned nurse\
  \ asks me where I\u2019m going now, so I explain I\u2019m heading straight to the\
  \ airport, silently wondering if I should trouble her to help me arrange a taxi.\n\
  \u201CHow long before your flight?\u201D\n\u201CWell, about 10 hours, but I\u2019\
  ve got a big book!\u201D\n Nope. Although I\u2019ve been discharged, I\u2019m invited\
  \ to stay in the hospital until the staff leave for the day, ushered into a spotless\
  \ white bed, brought fancy coffee and lunch. Then the curtains are closed so I can\
  \ take a nap. My head sinks into the fluffiest pillow in Myanmar.\nI\u2019m supposed\
  \ to be on a final souvenir dash now, but I haven\u2019t been dashing anywhere since\
  \ yesterday morning. Turning to my left to re-position my injured ankle, I\u2019\
  m suddenly falling again, or my body thinks it is; a vivid visceral memory that\
  \ takes me by surprise. Lurching left, downwards, rolling on the grass - get away\
  \ from the hooves. Right ankle wrenches but nothing else hurts. I\u2019m OK. Could've\
  \ been nasty, but I think I've got away with it. The horse is nearly at the horizon\
  \ before I can sit up. He\u2019s still galloping. \nSince then, I\u2019ve been reliant\
  \ on the kindness of strangers, and there\u2019s been a lot of it. The people at\
  \ the stables sending for their doctor, the lady at my hotel sneaking me extra rations\
  \ at breakfast \u2013 in bed no less. The backpackers with their whip-round of painkillers\
  \ and \u2018medicinal\u2019 cheroots. And now the kindest nurses I could ever imagine\
  \ caring for me when I\u2019m no longer even their patient. When I\u2019m wheeled\
  \ out to my taxi later, I\u2019m astonished to find 2 nurses accompanying me to\
  \ the airport. They only take their leave once I\u2019m safely in the terminal,\
  \ and I could not be more grateful.\nThe hospital surprises me once more with an\
  \ email that\u2019s waiting for me when I arrive back home. I have an unexpected\
  \ souvenir from my time in Myanmar - a broken ankle."
