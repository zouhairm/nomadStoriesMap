Text: In Halifax, Nova Scotia there is a park past the downtown core, train, and suburbs
  that will amaze you. When you go there in the summer, the trees are full, green
  and gorgeous. the main and small trail will embrace you and will be there for an
  entire morning if you are new to it. History pops up at different locations near
  the coast and there is a sense of wonder about it. one could spend an hour just
  sitting near the coast and look out to the wide ocean and landscapes across the
  water. For those who have a dog, a lot of the trail you are able to unleash your
  dog. it is just certain areas and when you enter or exit you leash them up. The
  park is so beautiful and a place to have to see more than once to catch everything.
  there are benches and places to rest if need be and a map of the park placed throughout
  different intersections and posts to tell you where you are. For those who want
  to see nature, history or get there workout on, this is a place to do it. You forget
  you are in the city, it is a park, a forest, a place for a great time.
