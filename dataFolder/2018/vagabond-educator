Text: "India is world's second most populated country in the world. There's cut throat\
  \ competitions to qualify in government higher education institutes. There's extremely\
  \ high pressure on students to perform from a tender age. Students suicide rate\
  \ is rising each year. The education system is the same which began in the colonial\
  \ period. The conventional formal education has slowly made it difficult for the\
  \ students to survive the competition. \n\nI call myself a 'victim' of the education\
  \ system which did not give me a line of thought to even think on exploring my deepest\
  \ interests or passion. Till high school, the education system never gave me a line\
  \ of thought to explore my potential. I was nearly in the excellent category when\
  \ it came to academics, therefore, it was assumed that I will take up science subjects\
  \ in Grade 11 as science subjects are considered for the brilliant and humanities\
  \ for the low achievers, therefore, I automatically took science; no questions asked,\
  \ no answers expected. However, by the time I graduated from one of India's top\
  \ engineering college,  I knew I had enough of following the bandwagon and decided\
  \ to take a road less travelled. I could see that there so many others who were\
  \ suffering like me and therefore, I started finding answers.\n\nFailing to find\
  \ answers in the conventional education system. I took a decision which proved to\
  \ be one of the more crucial decisions of my life. I decided to travel. I travelled\
  \ across my country India for 115 days. I visited the most rural learning centers\
  \ to urban schools. I met educationists and discussed my ideas on education. I did\
  \ extensive field work; I travelled with an India map marking schools / learning\
  \ centers which rejected the conventional system and helped students figure their\
  \ innate passion and interests. It was a snowball sampling because people in general\
  \ aren't aware of the alternate education spaces; therefore, I visited one space\
  \ and got to know from them about more similar centers. Vagabond me was ecstatic\
  \ to see some of the most empowering education spaces. During my travel, except\
  \ for two nights, I didn't have to bother about booking hotels- I slept in local\
  \ people homes; people, especially in the rural areas, always gave space to sleep\
  \ with a heartfelt smile. I ate delicious indigenous food. I talked in sign language\
  \ in places where I couldn't understand vernacular dialects. The whole travel gave\
  \ me so much of insight not only on education but also about me as an individual."
