Text: "Dubrovnik has a ghostly feel to it at dawn. Quiet cobblestone streets, empty\
  \ except for the stray cats that slink down the alleyways and creep through the\
  \ gutters. I think back on the last three days: walking the city walls, skinny-dipping\
  \ off the Croatian coast, sitting on the Iron Throne, and finding a local cat nursery.\
  \ A cat there reminded me of my childhood pet, triggering a flood of memories. It\u2019\
  s strange how you find traces of your past in new places.\n\nI get on the bus and\
  \ sit next to a girl with a shaved head and combat boots. Her name\u2019s Miha and\
  \ she\u2019s Croatian, born and raised in Dubrovnik. She\u2019s gentle and softly\
  \ spoken. Kind eyes and a shy but contagious smile. She reminds me of my mother.\n\
  \nShe\u2019s on her way to Zagreb for a design job. I ask if I can see some of her\
  \ work. After some hesitation, she removes a sketchbook from her backpack and hands\
  \ it to me. I hold it like a newborn and leaf through the pages, intoxicated by\
  \ this intimate snapshot of her creative essence. Her drawings are raw, messy even;\
  \ thick, dark strokes and occasional dabs of colour tug at my insides.\n\nI look\
  \ out the window at the Croatian coast: the rugged cliffs, the golden light of the\
  \ rising sun twinkling across the deep blue of the Adriatic Sea. My heart aches\
  \ as I think of all the beauty I\u2019m leaving behind.\n\nMiha and I talk about\
  \ family. She lives with one of her brothers in small apartment in Dubrovnik, which\
  \ has been passed down for generations, and has a couple more brothers scattered\
  \ throughout Croatia. Her father wasn\u2019t around and her mother died when she\
  \ was a teenager. I can feel the heartache when she talks about her mother. Her\
  \ story is remarkably similar to my own: absent father, brothers scattered across\
  \ Queensland, and a dead mother. We talk about the grief of losing our mothers.\
  \ There\u2019s no pretending or hiding behind humour or sarcasm or apathy. The rare\
  \ sort of conversation you can only have with someone who has experienced the same\
  \ trauma. We are naked together. Vulnerable. Then, silent.\n\nThe weather becomes\
  \ moodier as we approach Zagreb. Flashes of lightning in the distance and the pitter-patter\
  \ of rain on the windows. \n\nWe are both relieved when the bus arrives in Zagreb,\
  \ but it\u2019s bittersweet. We may never see each other again. It\u2019s like the\
  \ gut-wrenching feeling you get when you wake from a dream and you are separated\
  \ from that best friend or lover that your brain has tricked you into believing\
  \ that you have known your whole life."
