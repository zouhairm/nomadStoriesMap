Text: "We should have known it. Like an omen, hundreds of birds were flying over our\
  \ heads and taking place in the boat where we were, and then, as a second sign,\
  \ we saw dark clouds, lightning and thunder like an apocalyptic spectacle far away\
  \ on the horizon. Even with that, the morning in Punta de Choros was warm and clear.\
  \ \nMy partner and I decided to go to the dry Chilean north instead stayed in our\
  \ cold and green Patagonia, we knew the forecast was announcing rain during the\
  \ night but as we were talking with the locals less we believed that. Since ten\
  \ years they had a hard drought and a long time they hoped for rain. So without\
  \ doubt we continued to our main destination, Elqui Valley, a magical place surrounding\
  \ by big hills, with a spectacular clear sky. \nAt dusk while we were driving, the\
  \ most unexpected thing happened: small drops of water were covering the car\u2019\
  s glass. We couldn\u2019t believe it, and just for one moment we thought we were\
  \ wizards from the south, who under a basic alchemy made rain fall over this land\
  \ that was screaming for it.\nOn the night, we arrived to Pisco Elqui, a small town\
  \ in Elqui Valley, the electricity was cut so it was completely dark. We were sit\
  \ alone in the town\u2019s square when suddenly we heard the loud rumble of thunder,\
  \ then lightning and finally the strongest downpour that I ever saw. Sitting in\
  \ silence, perplexed, we started to hear an ecstatic celebration in the street,\
  \ and just in that moment we realized what we were witnessing: little kids that\
  \ never saw the rain before, teenagers with only a childhood memory of it, and adults\
  \ that couldn\u2019t believe the miracle falling on their faces and on their lands.\
  \ We felt a deep happiness, it was an exceptional moment, a collective ecstasy,\
  \ an unexpected apotheosis.\nOn the next day, the unexpected fierce rain kept everything\
  \ closed and the people were hiding from the cold and the rain in their poorly prepared\
  \ houses, so we decided to leave. We had a pure and innocent happy feeling\u2026\
  \ until later, when we knew what happened next: many floods, mudslides, and an uncertain\
  \ number of victims. Our chest tightened. We were there and we saw the happiness,\
  \ we were there and we couldn't even imagined the tragedy happening later, we were\
  \ there and with all the signs that the nature gave to us we could not have predicted\
  \ that."
