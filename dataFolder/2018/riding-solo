Text: "My decision wasn\u2019t extreme. My decision was comparably simple. One that\
  \ people do every year. Yet for me, it was completely out my comfort zone. \nIt\
  \ was the decision to travel alone. \nI felt as if I was running out of time to\
  \ travel. It would surely be an easy decision to leave home and travel continental\
  \ Europe by myself. Yet, it was never that simple. \nThis decision took me to the\
  \ edge due to societal norms that come with travelling. In the UK, there\u2019s\
  \ a pack mentality throughout your life. Until adult life, being alone is viewed\
  \ as a sign of weakness. You\u2019re always encouraged to have allies.\nI had booked\
  \ my flight just six days before. That rare impulse kicked in. I knew exactly where\
  \ I wanted to start \u2013 Berlin. \nMy flight was booked. The rush of adrenaline\
  \ was euphoric, but it turned to regret as I wasn\u2019t prepared. I hadn\u2019\
  t planned for a trip that I was going on, by myself, in six days. I have always\
  \ been an individual but have found comfort in groups. It\u2019s why I had the same\
  \ regret the day I was leaving to get my flight. \nNo maps. No internet.\nUpon landing,\
  \ I found the correct train. Instead of getting off at the comically close station\
  \ Warschauer Strasse, I departed at Ostbanhof. An extra 15 minutes-walk turned into\
  \ a massive detour, making a quick half-mile stroll a 45-minute exercise, as I lugged\
  \ my suitcase around in the heat. \nI wasn\u2019t sure how easy it would be to make\
  \ friends while travelling. My room was not a sociable one. I sat with a donner\
  \ kebab and wondered if I had conjured up a romanticised vision of travelling in\
  \ my head. \nA tour gave me the push I needed. Soon, I was getting drinks bought\
  \ for me and socialising with Frank, Angie and Sandee: three middle-aged metalheads\
  \ with a crazy gothic style. Not my image of what my trip would be like, but that\u2019\
  s what it was about: expecting the unexpected. That week before was manic. The first\
  \ day in Berlin was horrendous. The next few days? An epic warm-up to a trip where\
  \ I would travel over 4,000 miles. \nIt wasn\u2019t perfect. One of my suitcase\u2019\
  s wheel broke a week in and I ended up spending the last week carrying a suitcase\
  \ with a spiky rod sticking out the side of it. Travelling isn\u2019t fun if it\
  \ brings no challenges. Without the wheels falling off your metaphorical suitcase,\
  \ it\u2019d be too easy.\nI came to realise that playing it safe teaches you nothing.\
  \ My decisions pushed me out of my comfort zone. My decisions confronted who I was\
  \ as a person. My decisions made me the confident man I am today."
