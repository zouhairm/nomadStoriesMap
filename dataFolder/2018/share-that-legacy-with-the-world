Text: "When you enter the gastronomy school, the first thing you're advised is to\
  \ read and experience everything you can about the food. For a 16-year-old boy like\
  \ me, it was a dream to get to cook with the biggest ones in Spain or France, to\
  \ travel the Asian continent learning from the oriental culture that is so enigmatic\
  \ here in South America, or to have the opportunity to walk through the Oakland\
  \ beaches in search of inspiration for new dishes.\n\nFor me the reality was different,\
  \ my age and economic situation didn't allow me to emigrate to these destinations,\
  \ and I simply had to settle for learning from the books and YouTube videos I'd\
  \ find.\n\nBut what if instead of imagining what the different culinary cultures\
  \ would be like around the world, I would focus on what is inside my country?\n\
  It was so during my holiday at the end of the year, I borrowed some money from my\
  \ parents and my brother, took my bags and together with my cousin Daniel, we set\
  \ out to discover the cuisine that Colombia offered us.\n\nAfter arriving at the\
  \ bus terminal, we set out to head to what would be our first and most enigmatic\
  \ stop, Nuqui. This Chocoano municipality was known as the Cancun of the Colombian\
  \ Pacific.\nWe got there, and it could not be more incredible, we stayed in a small\
  \ cabin overlooking the ocean, next to the Diaz, who from the beginning welcomed\
  \ us as members of their family. During the following days we learned about their\
  \ farming and fishing processes, and they taught us how to prepare the traditional\
  \ Nuqui ceviche, which consisted in taking the fillets of the Nicuros (traditional\
  \ fish from the region) and cutting them into strips, then pour them in lemon juice\
  \ and orange with a touch of salt and pepper for 7 hours, and serve them with ayahuasca\
  \ leaves cut very finely.\n\nIt was there, when I understood the reason for this\
  \ trip, the food not only connects you to a place, but connects you to its roots,\
  \ its history and its legacy, that was the reason for studying gastronomy, sharing\
  \ that legacy with the world .\n\nAfter Nuqui, the experience could not be more\
  \ rewarding, we hunted with blowguns next to the Yucuna tribe of the Amazon rainforest,\
  \ we learned the Arabic origin of the Almoj\xE1bana (a traditional Colombian dough)\
  \ in the oldest streets of Tunja, and even prepared and ate culonas ants in the\
  \ city of San Gil.\n\nIt was the best experience of my life, and I already have\
  \ plans to repeat it again."
