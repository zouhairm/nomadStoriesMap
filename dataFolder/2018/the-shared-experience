Text: "When travelling in Northern Italy along the Cinque Terra, my aunt and me decided\
  \ to hike between Levanto and Montorosso. We had been craving to see the view from\
  \ the mountains of these historic fishing towns and so decided to do the hike between\
  \ them. Now unfortunately our climb did not begin in the best of ways, seeing as\
  \ we had enjoyed a rather large glass of the local wine the night before, we set\
  \ off later than one should on a long hike in the middle of July in Italy. Well\
  \ within the midday sun we embarked on the trip and being of Scottish descent this\
  \ was more of a feat that we expected.\n\nThe hike itself was like none I'd ever\
  \ had before. It was as though we were speeding through photographs of the worlds\
  \ ecosystems, getting glimpses of each before darting to the next. We hiked between\
  \ sun baked boulders with cracked trees, lush woodlands and along sheer cliffs with\
  \ the views of a clear waters below. As the hours slipped by we came upon the sign\
  \ telling us that we were close to the ridge that would overlook Montorosso. \n\n\
  Aching all over and more than a little dehydrated we were close to our primary goal\
  \ of seeing the view of the town. As we approached there was a tangible excitement\
  \ in our climb and looking back there is a tangible regret to the memory. When thinking\
  \ back on the moment we reached the peak of the mountain and had that very view\
  \ we craved, there was barely a pause before I had slipped out my phone and begun\
  \ filming the view.\n\nThe very view that we had become dehydrated, physically tired\
  \ and had worked hard to get to, I was viewing through the screen on my phone. The\
  \ last thing I expected from my memories of travelling and hiking in Italy was to\
  \ only be able to recall the photos and videos I took, as I had failed to actually\
  \ be present to the experiences as they were happening. Technology has improved\
  \ travelling but I can't help but wonder that in our eagerness to show our travels\
  \ to the world we are perhaps becoming secondary viewers to our own memories. \n\
  \nSharing our travels can be rewarding for both you and others, but at what point\
  \ do we stop seeing our experiences through the lens of a phone or camera and see\
  \ them instead through the lens of a cultural or spiritual awakening? While it might\
  \ seem clique what is the point in travelling if not to learn and allow questioning\
  \ to your own thinking? \n\nI for one, have learnt the worth of sometimes just keeping\
  \ the phone down and truly being present in the moment it counts."
