Text: "April 25, 2015. Kathmandu, h. 07.00 a.m. \nThe sun is shining. \nThe air is\
  \ sticky and smells of sugar, rice, lentils, spices and fried food. \nThe streets\
  \ are narrow. \nPeople selling, buying, talking, eating.\n\u2018Butter lamps are\
  \ good for mental energy, light one to help you when you go in the mountains\u2019\
  .\n\nH. 11.15 a.m. \nSome clouds appear in the sky. \nThe air is dense with incense\
  \ smoke. \nMultitudes of birds on the roofs of the temples supervise Durbar square.\
  \ \nGreen, pink, red, yellow saris waltz around the image of Kal Bhairav. \n\u2018\
  It\u2019s festival today: pray, butter lamps, flowers and candy for the god\u2019\
  .\n\nH. 11.56 a.m.\nA strong wind blows. \nHundreds of birds all together quickly\
  \ fly away. \nA blasting noise. \nThe earth shakes violently. \nSome people run,\
  \ others fall. \nThe earth stops shaking. \nCollapsing buildings, cracked streets.\n\
  The air is thick with dust and rubble. \nA mother cries for help, her little boy\
  \ is buried under the remains of Narayan Temple. \nOur clothes, our hair, our skin,\
  \ all is brownish-orange. \nAn English woman hugs me tight. She is crying and shaking\
  \ violently. \u2018We are alive\u2026 I'm a nurse, I must go and help\u2019.\n\n\
  H. 12.15 p.m.\nClouds are thick in the sky and it is getting darker.\nIncense and\
  \ spices no longer fill the air. \nThe streets are deserted. \nDeafening silence\
  \ around me, I can hear myself breath. \nThe small square where I lit my butter\
  \ lamp in the morning is still crowded with people praying loudly while holding\
  \ on to each other in a human chain anchored to the metal bars and prayer wheels\
  \ around the small temples. \nPeople screaming, people crying, people dying. \n\u2018\
  You are right to leave, there's nothing more here for you\u2019 \u2013 says a young\
  \ Nepalese with terror in his eyes. \n\nApril 26, 2015. Kathmandu airport, h. 03.25\
  \ p.m.\nThe sky is grey after the drizzling rain during the night.\nThe cold tarmac\
  \ in front of the airport keeps shaking from aftershocks. \nI squeeze myself in\
  \ the sweaty and confused mass of people pushing its way in the terminal building.\
  \ \n\u2018We apologize, all the systems are down so we have to do manual check in.\
  \ We are doing our best to get you all back home\u2019 \u2013 says a young woman\
  \ at the counter talking to me in a poised, professional manner with tears in her\
  \ eyes.\n\u2018Are you all right?\u2019\u2019\n\u2018Some of my relatives and friends\
  \ are missing\u2026 Here is your boarding pass\u2026 Please, pray for us, pray for\
  \ the Nepalese people\u2019.\n\nH. 09.40 p.m. \nThe airplane door closes. \nIt is\
  \ dark outside.\nThe pouring rain is crying for a broken Nepal."
