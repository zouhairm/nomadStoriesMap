Text: "Sometimes people  do crazy things for love. In my case, i lost my mind and\
  \ my body in an unexpected journey at the door of the end of the world.\nI can\u2019\
  t tell how i finished there: In a stop bus, in the middle of nothing. It was the\
  \ second time i get stranded there\u2026 alone. I was in San Carlos.  A truck stopped\
  \ and my journey began, again.\nThrough the window i saw the green extended for\
  \ kilometers. Mountains and volcanoes began to appear, shamefully. The trucker talk\
  \ to me, but all in my head was: i'm lost in a beautiful world and i don't know\
  \ how far i can go.\nAfter almost seven hours of getting on and off of trucks, I\
  \ arrived in Temuco between in a beautiful sunset, peacefully red as fire and silence.\
  \ \nIt didn't matter to me, walk or be in a car. You don\u2019t need to think ample,\
  \ just don\u2019t die. Everything feels wonder, even a broken heart. So, I keep\
  \ my journey, met a few people and  cows until Puerto Montt.\nWhen  arrives to Puerto\
  \ Montt you\xB4ll see the city and islands, at your right, the austral road to Magallanes.\
  \ In your back, Calbuco, an active volcano who brightness cause\u2019 lava, but\
  \  have snow. It's all a postal. \nThere, friends was waiting for me with \xAB milcaos\
  \ \xBB. Two day after  I went  to Chilo\xE9, cross the Chacao river. It was morning\
  \ when  i start to walk. A couple took me to Castro, de capital of the island. In\
  \ the way, rain and fast wind became in a sunny day.\nEverything was full of tourists\
  \ and my pockets, empty. I decided to join a group of backpackers and camping at\
  \ a beach called \"Los Piojos\". It was already eleven o'clock at night when we\
  \ set up the tents.\nBetween guitars and wine, I could see the stars while I was\
  \ in the sand. A campfire sheltered me what my clothes couldn\u2019t do. What led\
  \ me to this situation? I thought,  just  a partner asked me the same.\nI breathed.\
  \ \"I met a girl, we fell in love. We went to Chillan, angry for some stupidity.\
  \ She stopped talking to me, I decided to return to Valpara\xEDso, I ended up in\
  \ San Antonio\u201D. Others started to hear my story.\n\u201CSpending the night\
  \ in the bus of a driver, I decided to go for her to Concepci\xF3n. I didn't find\
  \ her. I was going back to the north when an intuition called me to the south\"\
  .\nI felt happy, the cold, the people, the clean air, no pressure. The green of\
  \ the road, the height of the mountains, even the sand in my pants and the hunger,\
  \ made me feel that I was free.\nMy parter said \"poor thing\" hugging me. I laughed,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t be happier. It was at the entrance to the end of the world."
