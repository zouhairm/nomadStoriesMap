Text: "I grew up as a dreamy child in New delhi. In hopes to see the world, I now\
  \ find it is not in a time bound itenary trip that you understand the world but\
  \ it is a onward journey. All the lonely People, where do they all come from. All\
  \ the lonely people, where do they all belong?\nIn this busy world, sometimes you\
  \ find the answers and sometimes you stumble on the right questions while moving\
  \ to realize how minute your troubles are. \n\nMy story added a new chapter in April\
  \ 2017, when I finally packed my bags, mustered guts and decided to go for an impromptu\
  \ trip after a busy day of back to back meetings.  I was a bit apprehensive to travel\
  \ alone from Mumbai to Lonavala, as I am from Delhi and I hadn't much idea of Maharashtra,\
  \ its culture, dos and donts as I had never traveled alone. I was a bit scared yet\
  \ exhilarated to be on my own in a totally new place , looking out for myself and\
  \ making my own decisions. \nAt first I had decided to rent out a vila to myself\
  \ , but as it was off season and at a secluded place taking in consideration I was\
  \ traveling alone, I decided to rent a hotel near to the market place. The auto\
  \ rickshaw driver showed me a few hotels around the main market, which i finally\
  \ liked and thanked him for. I checked in after raising some eyebrows as to why\
  \ i was traveling alone, but the hotel manager turned out to be a really helpful\
  \ fellow. I ordered chicken biryani for dinner which the hotel staff brought promptly\
  \ after which I retired to sleep. \nNext day, I checked out nearby places to visit\
  \ and also asked the hotel manager for a few suggestions, he sweetly helped me put\
  \ together a plan much elaborate than google suggestions. Thus, I began my day by\
  \ visiting Narayani dham, then a walk to the Bhushi dam followed by a journey through\
  \ Sahyadri mountain range leading to duke's nose. In the afternoon I had a very\
  \ simple Maharashtrian fish thali and spicy Dabeli. usually auto wallahas in Delhi,\
  \ where I have grown up are rude to strangers, dont ply by meter and overcharge\
  \ but in lonavala and khandala I felt very different, hearing family stories and\
  \ talking to people all around I didnt even know. It felt very personalized to have\
  \ random conversations with the locals and someone looking out for you. If someone\
  \ does happen to go to Lonavala or Khandala and wants to travel in a auto all day\
  \ with multiple stops, you can safely connect with Suresh Bhaiya at 09158814809.\
  \ Whoever you are, Wherever it is, wish you a safe and beautiful journey ahead."
