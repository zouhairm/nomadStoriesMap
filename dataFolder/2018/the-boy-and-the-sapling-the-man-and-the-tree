Text: "Sometimes, the most compelling stories aren\u2019t the ones with the most grandeur.\
  \ These stories are all around us, and they can be written into the most unassuming\
  \ of places. I was somewhere amongst sun-drenched valleys in rural Sicily when I\
  \ learned that if a picture is worth a thousand words, then a landscape must be\
  \ worth a million.\L\nSimone\u2019s farm is in the sticks, accessible only by a\
  \ single winding road which snakes through the mountains. He stands now, puffing\
  \ on a cigarette beneath the shade of a giant persimmon tree in the center of his\
  \ farm, unbuttoned shirt flowing in the breeze. His skin has been richly bronzed\
  \ and toughened by decades of working beneath the harsh sun. A deeply-lined face\
  \ frames a set of pale blue eyes, as piercing as they are kind. Seeing us approach,\
  \ his mouth widens into a toothy grin.\nIt\u2019s the busy period of the olive harvest,\
  \ and I am volunteering help in a small eco-village. Today, one of the friendly\
  \ community members, Crescenzo, has invited me to visit an old friend- Simone.\n\
  \u201CWe might be able to take some fruit\u201D he chuckles, as we walk over to\
  \ join Simone under the tree. \LWithout one common language to communicate in, the\
  \ three of us still manage to converse together using a concoction of Sicilian,\
  \ Italian and English. I gaze upwards; persimmons encircle an enormous stump like\
  \ a galaxy of golden orbs for meters up into the sky. In the staccato of Siciliano,\
  \ Simone says something to Crescenzo, who turns to me to explain:\n\u201CSimone\u2019\
  s family has been on this land for generations. He says he planted this very tree\
  \ as a sapling when he was a child.\u201D\nI look at Simone, who stands there grinning,\
  \ clearly having read my astonished face.\L I don\u2019t know how old Simone is,\
  \ but I would guess that he is well into his 80\u2019s- as old as the tree that\
  \ towers above us now. I realize that there is a story woven into this land. Preserved\
  \ in a tree or behind a pair of knowing eyes, these are stories that unfold like\
  \ no book. A boy and a sapling grow together into man and tree, the course of a\
  \ life transpires in a partnership of person and place. To see the passage of time\
  \ manifest in the aged figures before me is strangely wonderful; even more so to\
  \ know that my presence in that passage is a mere blink. I can\u2019t help but wonder-\
  \ how many more untold tales lie latent in this land and beyond.\nSimone plucks\
  \ a nearby persimmon and offers it to me. Accepting the invitation eagerly, I bite\
  \ into the fruit and let the sweet, delicious nectar fill my mouth."
