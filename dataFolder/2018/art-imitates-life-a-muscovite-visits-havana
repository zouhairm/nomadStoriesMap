Text: "During my first long-haul flight, the drunk man beside me vomited onto the\
  \ back of a seat. I was a young Russian girl, about to turn 21 and itching to travel\
  \ as far as possible away from my comfort zone. A twelve-hour flight from Moscow\
  \ to Havana, locked in an enclosed space with the stench of nausea, was a great\
  \ start.\n\nMy fair complexion is mediocre in Russia, but exotic in Cuba. I couldn\u2019\
  t walk down a single block in Havana without hearing wolf whistles or tongue clicks.\
  \ When a virile Cuban yelled at me from a doorway for the umpteenth time, I broke.\
  \ As my introverted anxiety turned into an adventurer\u2019s adrenaline, I approached\
  \ my perpetrator and demanded his name.\n\nSomething unexpected happened: my voice\
  \ pricked a hole in his confidence. Sensing his weakness, I hurled questions at\
  \ him and found out the following: he had a girlfriend. He\u2019d won the US green\
  \ card lottery. He was leaving to Miami in a week. He was an artist. I asked him\
  \ what the building was. He invited me inside. \n\nAs a culture-loving Muscovite,\
  \ I'd stepped into paradise. Brightly coloured columns held up the tall ceiling\
  \ that towered over vintage German machinery. Artwork covered every surface. It\
  \ was the largest art studio I'd ever seen and my foe-turned-friend was also my\
  \ host, insider and guide.\n\nThe first artist he introduced me to was short, skinny\
  \ and serious. His art superimposed images of sneakers hanging over electricity\
  \ cables onto maps of the world. His voice tingled with nostalgia as he explained\
  \ that this was a homage to his \xE9migr\xE9 friends.\n\nThe second artist was a\
  \ voluptuous, middle-aged woman, who showed me portraits of orishas - ethereal beings\
  \ with with striking eyes and voluminous hair, figureheads of santer\xEDa - Cuba\u2019\
  s fusion of Yoruba and Catholicism.\n\nThe third artist was a short, wiry, frisky\
  \ man with dancing eyes. He and his prints had been profiled in the New York Times\
  \ - skeletons in real-life situations, life defying death.\n\nThe fourth artist\
  \ moonlighted as a producer in a prestigious film school. His print was of two heads,\
  \ tongues intertwined. When explaining the double entendre, he lowered his voice\
  \ - being tongue-tied meant living under censorship.\n\nIt was here (not a five-star\
  \ hotel with an artificial swimming pool, but the \u201CTaller Experimental de Gr\xE1\
  fica\u201D) that I got to know a country and its people. Flirtatious and serious,\
  \ vivacious and struggling, celebrating life and admonishing it - a culture both\
  \ wildly different and astonishingly similar to my own."
