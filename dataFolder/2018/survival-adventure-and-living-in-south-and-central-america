Text: Ok so this is part of my travel story everyone says i should write a book but
  honestly im not a great writer but i should learn. so there was a time in Panama
  when i used my skill as a painter to gain some money (by the way my travel lasted
  two nearly two years whith no saveings and i just have to make form my own back)
  so i met this guy and he wanted me to paint someting for him he paid me for the
  work i did and then asked me to do something  eles for a lot more money so when
  i finishe dthe other thing he didt pay me i eneded up spending all that money i
  made because i thought i could get more. i had to leave panama because i only had
  one day left on out of the 3months permited there so i had to hurry i was in a place
  called boquete and my mission was to get to costa rica. i had no money nothing just
  a bottle of rum which i stole from the guy because he didt pay me anyway i was off
  i hitch hiked all the way up to bocas del toro to a small town called changuinola.
  a old man said this town is dangerous at night and i should find a place to stay
  i told him i had nothing and i hitched all the way from boquete he tried to help
  me but couldt it was starting to get dark and i had to get out of the town so i
  didt get robbed so i made my way to the banna farms were i asked some locals if
  i could stay in there in my hammock they said ok. the next day was the last day
  i was aloud in panama so it was kinda stressy. i had a drink of my rum and a coconut
  i got from a tree and then hitched from a guy in a taxi to the boarder woop. but
  there is this problem at that boarder there are people that like to get money form
  tourist by selling them a sticker so my plan was get my stamp then they cart do
  nothing so i got my stamp and made my way to the bridge were this guy stopped me
  and said i need to get a sticker to leave i was like no im not getting it i have
  my stamp and carryied on walking until a guy in a millitary cotume stopped me and
  said the same thing but i had no cash and i couldt say that because i might not
  get into costa rica so i just kept to the pain and said no im not paying for it
  after a long time they let me go got in costa rica no problems its 8am and i was
  already drunk i hitched another ride from a taxi driver again all the way to a city
  called limon its was like not  were i wanted to go so i had a tille bit more rum
  left i sold it to this guy for some bus money so i could get to a place called puerto
  viejo got there and found a place to voulenteer.
