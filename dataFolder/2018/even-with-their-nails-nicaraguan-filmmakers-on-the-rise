Text: "On a month-long family visit to Nicaragua two years ago, I was determined to\
  \ answer the question: how was Nicaragua\u2019s national cinema thriving in the\
  \ absence of a film industry infrastructure?  I booked my flight and packed my audio-video\
  \ equipment.  It was a passion-project.  I had no permits, no budget, nor crew.\
  \ I emailed local journalist-historian Karly Gaitan-Morales, who had just published\
  \ the first-ever comprehensive book on the history of Nicaraguan cinema.   Gaitan-Morales\
  \ guided me with a list of filmmakers to interview.  But as I looked at the list,\
  \ I was intrigued by the fact that the majority were women with impressive filmographies.\
  \ \n\nIn Managua, I borrowed my uncle\u2019s van, loaded it up with my video equipment,\
  \ and solicited the help of my untrained 15-year-old cousin.  Although I was used\
  \ to the unruly city traffic, this was my first time in the driver\u2019s seat.\
  \  I should have been more terrified, but I was blinded by my mission to bring visibility\
  \ to the work of Nicaraguan filmmakers. \n\nThe result of my work was 'Even With\
  \ Their Nails', a 30-minute documentary that celebrates women filmmakers in Nicaragua.\
  \  The title originates from the Spanish idiom 'hasta con las u\xF1as,' which means\
  \ pulling oneself up by the bootstraps.  \n\nSince film financing seized at the\
  \ end of INCINE (1979-1990), the only government-funded production house, the sustainability\
  \ of a national cinema has not been feasible given the urgent economic needs of\
  \ the country.  Yet filmmaking has persisted for almost 30 years with minimal resources.\
  \  What I discovered, is that without a government-regulated film industry, there\
  \ has been an ideological shift in the practice of filmmaking.  This shift is reflected\
  \ by the increase of women-centric narratives, socio-ethical perspectives, and relevant\
  \ concerns within indigenous and youth communities.  Filmmakers today, the majority\
  \ who happen to be women, have embraced a \u201Clearn-by-doing\u201D philosophy\
  \ that makes them industrious in the absence of a film industry. \n\nThe increasing\
  \ number of Nicaraguan women working behind the camera is a significant trend within\
  \ Central America.  Some attribute this phenomenon to the reconfiguration of gender\
  \ norms that occurred after the Sandinista revolution.  But access to digital equipment\
  \ has also opened a space for women to acquire more leadership positions during\
  \ production. Women filmmakers are now the pride of Nicaraguan cinema, and courageously\
  \ continue to produce inspiring work."
