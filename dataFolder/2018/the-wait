Text: "The Wait\n\nThere is a reason why this remote region in north Canada it's called\
  \ THE Yukon. Neighbor of Alaska, this is a unique place and the little town of Whitehorse\
  \ is its gateway. Things start to get surreal on the way: buffalos on the side of\
  \ the road, frozen rivers and forests. A white blanket covers everything that meets\
  \ the eye. You can even walk on water (a frozen lake). Its pretty obvious mother\
  \ nature is the ruler in this place. You are a guest so all you can do is watch,\
  \ listen and bring a jacket.\n\nUsually there is only one purpose when you travel\
  \ north in the winter; to see the northern lights, and that's exactly what took\
  \ me there. As you arrive your wait starts. What I didn't know was all the other\
  \ adventures this wait would bring. The right context can lead you to the most amazing\
  \ stories. In THE Yukon you can find that feeling we travelers pursue; being taken\
  \ away from our common life and dropped in a playground, where we can find the unexpected.\n\
  \nFor me the unexpected started with Gui, a French bushman who lived with his dogs\
  \ on a trailer in the middle of nowhere. This amazing character took me on the back\
  \ of his snowmobile across a frozen lake to dogsled with his \"babies\" through\
  \ the frozen forest. Dusk on a white canvas on the journey back. At that moment\
  \ I laughed; \"My dad would love this!\". Followed by an old couple dancing to fiddling\
  \ in a local bar of shotguns and skins only a couple of blocks away from the finish\
  \ line of the Yukon Quest. At last a bonfire observed by a white fox. Another world.\
  \ I only wish waiting could be like this on a more regular basis. \n\nThen, when\
  \ you least expect it, the phone rings. It's Nancy on the other end, the owner of\
  \ the only hostel in town. \"Go right away to the spot I told you\"- she gave us\
  \ a hand drawn map- \"the lights are coming\", and we didn't even stay at her hostel!\
  \ \n\nHere I am, turning 25, looking at the night sky being able to see my breath.\
  \ Nothing, not even the endless power of imagination, is able to grasp the utter\
  \ beauty of a dancing sky of color. Pure poetry as a good friend of mine would say.\
  \ I'm feeling so small and yet part of the universe. I AM this dancing light, I\
  \ exist because she's dancing for me and she does while I look at her. I'm being\
  \ deeply touched by her, modifying my brain by this new meter of beauty. This is\
  \ why you wait; this is why I displaced myself 7,427 miles. In this moment everything\
  \ makes sense. All the choices I made make sense. I am 25 now and fully satisfied\
  \ with where my life has taken me."
