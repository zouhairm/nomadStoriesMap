Text: "\u201CBut what makes you think that you can survive without our support in\
  \ Varanasi?\u201D My father, the patriarch of a conservative Brahmin family, asked\
  \ me as I announced my decision to leave my parental house to pursue further studies\
  \ in a faraway city.\nVaranasi, it is believed, bestows Moksha upon the visitors\
  \ who seek liberation from the bondage of life and death. I didn\u2019t desire Moksha\
  \ for the term was too complex to be understood by my teenage mind. At the tender\
  \ age of 15, my sole desire was to escape the hostile family environment which was\
  \ characterized by routine fights between my parents. Varanasi, I believed, would\
  \ provide me refuge and liberation albeit of a different kind. I had to appear for\
  \ the entrance exam of a prestigious school and secure top rank to get a full scholarship.\
  \ I was fully prepared to embark on a life transforming journey. Was I?\nWith 600rs\
  \ in my pocket and a dream to chase I ran to the station which was not very far\
  \ from the place where I was born and brought up. It was my maiden solo journey\
  \ into the anarchical world that was out there to swallow the dreams of thousands\
  \ of escapists like me. The Indian railways welcomed me with its signature blue\
  \ coaches, jam-packed bogies and an eternal struggle to find a space to fit in.\
  \ It was the dead of night and I had managed to carve out a temporary niche for\
  \ me in the coach. The train reached Gorakhpur at dawn from where I had to catch\
  \ another train to reach Varanasi- my destination. To my pleasant surprise the ticket\
  \ examiner had not come to check our tickets and I decided to save some money by\
  \ not buying a ticket for the onward journey. As I reached Varanasi at mid-day I\
  \ was shining very bright just as the overhead sun did.  My brightness proved momentary\
  \ as the ticket examiner at the Varanasi station caught me without ticket and I\
  \ had to pay a fine of 350 rupees. It was the first lesson of my liberated life.\
  \ More lessons were to follow. I somehow managed to stay for 2 nights in a dormitory\
  \ and saved some money by walking to and from the exam center and by avoiding breakfasts\
  \ and lunches. I appeared for the exam and solved all the questions. On my journey\
  \ back home while taking a nap in the train I was liberated from my black & white\
  \ sleepers. \nI reached home late at night and nobody noticed my bare feet. The\
  \ results were declared in a month and finally I got my ticket to learn lessons\
  \ ,this time, in the school of my dreams in the city of Moksha."
