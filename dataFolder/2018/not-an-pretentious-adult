Text: "I just became an adult. During my flight, away from home and my parents for\
  \ the first time in the supposedly most important day of the year, I turned 18 \u2013\
  \ which is the legal age in Brazil. Sitting there, anxiously waiting for the beginning\
  \ of my first business trip, nothing had changed. It is just a presentation, and\
  \ then I will be back.\nEverything was carefully placed to provide a great experience\
  \ to the experts, and I was one of them. I could truly believe that all the politicians\
  \ in Washington D.C. would find that 4-chandelier lobby extremely simple, but, to\
  \ me, it was above anything I have ever seen. Is it being an adult?\nNonetheless,\
  \ the joy would not invade my body inside the superb bedroom. I needed to go somewhere\
  \ else. In the next morning, I walked around looking for a place to have breakfast\
  \ spending less than a US $20 bill. Luckily, I did not find it.\nI went so far in\
  \ the January cold that I almost forgot about the existence of my nose and fingers.\
  \ It made me wonder if anyone could be truly happy with the weather. The serious\
  \ expressions and the fast steps answered me.\nIt was a rash assumption. I met Joseph.\
  \ Happily, opening and closing the doors to those pretentious experts. None of them\
  \ seemed to notice Joseph\u2019s presence, but he was there, smiling and greeting.\n\
  Ironically, everyone seemed to notice my presence. Tour guides showing the grandiosity\
  \ of Washington D.C. They were trying too hard. I felt more connected to the city\
  \ when I got lost and met an old lady, called Janet, trying to understand the embed\
  \ epitaph in the Lincoln Memorial\u2019s wall.\nBefore the presentation day, I had\
  \ a terrible night. I could not stand that enormous bedroom by myself. I decided\
  \ to wait for the sunrise in the 4-chandelier lobby.\nJoseph was there. I started\
  \ a modest conversation. A safe approach? The weather. He talked about how beautiful\
  \ D.C. is during the summer. He tried the safe approach too. Why are you not sleeping?\
  \ Oh, my anxiety is killing me.\nIt was a beautiful sunrise.\nIn the next morning,\
  \ I managed to find an under $20 place to have breakfast and managed to save the\
  \ transportation money using the bus line. All thanks to Joseph. He was not used\
  \ to acknowledgment. Thus, he made me want to return to Washington and chat with\
  \ him again.\nAt this point, I realized that I was not an adult because I turned\
  \ 18. The people around me seemed adult-like and, standing there, I did not want\
  \ to be one of them. I want to be like Joseph as he greets everyone passing by."
