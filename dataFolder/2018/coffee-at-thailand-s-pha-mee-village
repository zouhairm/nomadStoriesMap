Text: "Coffee for the people of Doi Pha Mee village in northern Thailand means much\
  \ more than being a vital staple. For them, the coffee they produce is a symbol\
  \ of love from the late King Rama IX who helped transform the community from an\
  \ opium plantation to an example of community-based tourism.\n\nPha Mee, which literally\
  \ means \u201CBear Mountain,\u201D is a community located in the nothern Thai province\
  \ of Chiang Rai where the Akha tribe continous to observe its long-standing tradition\
  \ of coffee production, farming, and cotton weaving.\n\nIts homegrown Arabica coffee,\
  \ however, was King Rama IX's contribution almost five decades ago for the Akha\
  \ tribe to turn their backs against planting opium, a substance derived from the\
  \ poppy plant used to produce illegal drugs.\n\n\"Our King liked this community\
  \ to do farming, to avoid all the illegal things. In the old days, they don't have\
  \ much choice. They grew opium which is wrong. What our king planned for his people\
  \ is that he wanted them to have a better life,\" the community's Polwang, or local\
  \ leader, said as translated in English.\n\nPolwang said this royal heritage is\
  \ one of the key highlights Pha Mee wants visitors to learn more. \u201CThis to\
  \ promote the community so that people would know more about Pha Mee and the relationship\
  \ between the people and how they respect our King Rama IX.\u201D\n\nHe added that\
  \ King Rama IX thought of coffee production as the solution for the community's\
  \ livelihood woes following his two visits to Pha Mee, the last of which was in\
  \ the 1970s.\n\nTourists can also experience how the Akha tribe produces the Arabica\
  \ coffee in Pha Mee, from how they sort the seed of the coffee cherry to roasting\
  \ the beans in a clay pot until the beans are crushed to make the coffee powder.\n\
  \nOther activities available in Pha Mee is cotton weaving which makes the traditional\
  \ Akha clothes, visit the Busaw Homestay for a picturesque view of the Chiang Rai\
  \ highlands, and ride the Akha Swing \u2013 a giant swing made of wood and bamboo\
  \ where you can shout your heart out.\n\nVisitors, however, are encouraged to contact\
  \ Local Alike, a social enterprise that provides tours to local communities, first\
  \ before scheduling their trip to Pha Mee.\n\nLocal Alike is a partner of Thai AirAsia's\
  \ Journey D program which aims to improve the tour programs, accommodation and quality\
  \ of services, and English communication skills of local communities.\n\nAfter visiting\
  \ Pha Mee, tourists can also drop by the Wat Rong Khun, or The White Temple, and\
  \ Singha Park."
