Text: "Enter the tiny village town of Muang Ngoi approximately a one hour boat journey\
  \ north from the boat station in Nong Khiaw up the Nam Ou river. This remote paradise\
  \ features beautiful private river side bungalows with stunning Forrest views from\
  \ decked balconies where you can truly take in the scenery. \nUpon exploring the\
  \ tiny village town I met some local gentlemen who informed me of this beautiful\
  \ water cave I could hike out to, In which I did but only went swimming in the mouth\
  \ of the cave as it was well lit and I unfortunately did not bring a head torch\
  \ to explore the rest of the cave system, however I decided to cross the river and\
  \ continued my hike up an un-graded, un-bichamised dirt road used by local villagers\
  \ where quite often you see many tractors filled to the brim with bags of rice harvested\
  \ from the many villages along the way. \nApproximately two kilometres down the\
  \ track there was another river crossing and then I came to this magnificent village\
  \ called Ba Na, upon crossing into the field I offered help to the workers in which\
  \ the humbly accepted and was given the opportunity to help them out for a few hours\
  \ until we finished and headed for shade where we drank Lao Lao (a type of home\
  \ brew rice wine if you will) whilst sitting down I was informed of another village\
  \ if I crossed yet another river in which I happily did continuing up yet another\
  \ dirt path I was covered in leeches and made it to Huay Bo village where myself\
  \ and a friend did a home stay in a tiny shack with no electricity or running water.\
  \ We met a local villager who offered to take us out hunting in the jungle early\
  \ the following morning... an offer we could not say no to. \n\nEarly morning we\
  \ awake and meet up with our now local friend who took us out far into the jungle\
  \ to fish in the streams and shoot native birds in the trees. Trekking through dense\
  \ jungle and rapid streams we make it to a great little spot too cook up the fish\
  \ and native jungle vegetables we had collected earlier. Surround by jungle we cut\
  \ up bamboo to make a fire and hollowed out a longer piece of bamboo to stuff our\
  \ catch and vegetables into to cook. Upon cooking it started heavily raining so\
  \ we built a shelter to prevent the fire from going out and managed to collect wild\
  \ parmellos from a tree we took shelter under and enjoy the wild flavours of fresh\
  \ fish and jungle vegetation boiled together simply in bamboo whilst indulging in\
  \ Lao Lao waiting for the rain to cease."
