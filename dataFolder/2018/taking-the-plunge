Text: "\u201CWell it looks like the rocks end here.\u201D I announced slightly annoyed.\
  \  \u201CAnd it looks like we have to go back like I said five minutes ago \u2013\
  \ I mean, unless we swim across.\u201D I added jokingly. \n\n\u201CWell\u2026we\
  \ technically could swim?\u201D\n\nIt was one of those summer days \u2013 so bright\
  \ you had to squint at the reflective white light that reached every inch of the\
  \ sandy beaches, and so incredibly hot and humid that the cool and clear turquoise\
  \ water need not entice us further. We were spending it the best way we knew how\
  \ \u2013 searching for adventure in the trails of Hong Kong. The cerulean water\
  \ sparkled like the diamond studded watches cushioned in the well-lit display windows\
  \ of luxurious stores situated only a few hours away in the dense bustling city.\
  \ \n\nWe had strayed off the trail to examine the rock pools; intricate worlds which\
  \ existed in beautiful little teacup lakes down by the rocky shores. We then followed\
  \ the craggy shoreline, thinking it may eventually run tangent to the trail \u2013\
  \ until we reached a dead end. Thick tropical foliage had emerged to our left, a\
  \ deep blue ocean to our right, the way we came shadowing behind us, and ahead,\
  \ the edge of a cliff. We stood one story high, gazing down into an enchanting cove\
  \ inlet cupping the sea with a wall of jagged rock.  It was a half kilometer swim\
  \ across to a four story cliff which we would have to scale upward completely unequipped.\n\
  \nMaybe it was the heat, maybe it was the disappointment of turning back...maybe\
  \ it was the allure of an adventure, but after a short discussion on logistics,\
  \ we sprinted off the edge - plunging into the salty water.\n\nIt was reviving.\
  \ It was like swimming in cool liquid sapphire. After this short swim we made it\
  \ to the base of the steep cliff. Amethyst sea urchins lounged in the crevasses\
  \ of the rocks below the water - their purple spikes ready to skewer an ill placed\
  \ foot. We found an urchin-free zone and began to scale. Luckily the cliff wasn\u2019\
  t sheer. Soaked and dripping, we managed to scramble ungracefully onto a flat area.\
  \ The climb up was slow, and became a constant search for convenient footholds.\
  \ By the time we reached the top, we were almost dry from the sun\u2019s radiant\
  \ strength. We stood on the edge, listening to the sound of waves while breathing\
  \ in the smell of the ocean and the fruity smells of the forest. We were up so high\
  \ on a quaint open plain, and could see just how far we had come."
