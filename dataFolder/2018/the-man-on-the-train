Text: "\u201CMind if I join you?\u201D I took care to pronounce each word carefully.\
  \ \u201CJe peux m'installer ici?\u201D I am more than proficient at the French language\
  \ \u2013 fluent, even - yet my family delight in telling me that it doesn't matter\
  \ if I use French or English, given the great speed at which I speak. \n\nHe did\
  \ not mind, gesturing to one of the vacant seats that faced him. The dining car\
  \ was just busy enough that I didn't have the luxury of choosing a table to myself.\
  \ I sat down, nodding briefly in thanks, and gazed out the window. Darkness met\
  \ my gaze, and I wondered what of the Italian countryside might have otherwise been\
  \ visible. \n\nSmall talk ensued. We discussed the comfort of the train, the lengthy\
  \ journey ahead. I'd never travelled on the Thello service, and was quietly thrilled\
  \ to be on this overnight train from Venice to Paris. My journey had been well researched\
  \ \u2013 for me, there is as much joy in anticipation as in execution. My private\
  \ cabin was basic, but my romanticism more than compensated for that, and the warm\
  \ prosecco and questionable cannelloni I was served. I\_ looked forward to being\
  \ lulled to sleep by the train's rhythmic progress, and waking up to a new day in\
  \ a new city. \n\nI conveyed as much to my companion (in French, bien s\xFBr) and\
  \ enquired into his travel plans. Xavier is a sculptor, and was commuting from Venice\
  \ to Paris, having a studio in each city. He preferred the tranquillity of train\
  \ travel to the irritation of busy airports and cramped aeroplanes. He was, as it\
  \ transpired, having sculptures installed at the Pompidou Centre that week. I realised\
  \ Xavier must be a man of some talent, and also some renown. Politeness prompted\
  \ him to invite me to the installation. We exchanged email addresses; he bade me\
  \ goodnight and we retired to our respective cabins. \n\nParis proved delightful\
  \ as ever \u2013 an intoxicating mixture of returning home and making new discoveries.\
  \ I'd forgotten about my encounter with the man on the train. I was surprised to\
  \ receive, two days later, an email containing an invitation to breakfast and the\
  \ installation of Xavier Veilhan's sculptures of Richard Rogers and Renzo Piano\
  \ at the Pompidou Centre.\n\nAnd so on a Thursday morning in October, I found myself\
  \ at Caf\xE9 Beaubourg, conversing with artists, fashion designers, and art collectors\
  \ \u2013 among them the inimitable Hubert Neumann. The whole delightful episode\
  \ married my loves of Paris, of art and architecture, of fresh croissants and good\
  \ coffee, of meeting new people. Parfait."
