Text: "\u201CYou have reached the voicemail box of 8-1-4-\u201D\nAs I hung up, my\
  \ imagination ran rampant. How did things get to this point? We had been days away\
  \ from starting a new chapter of our lives together. Now, 1500 miles from Erie,\
  \ in the middle of a disaster zone, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that everything\
  \ that could go wrong, was. \n\u201CShe didn\u2019t answer, Jill. I\u2019m going\
  \ to go for a walk\u201D\nThe family that I was staying with had been lucky. Their\
  \ house was one of the few bastions of safety in the neighborhood. It was not even\
  \ a block away from where the destruction began. Jill was in the middle of making\
  \ dinner. Tater-tot casserole was the best that she could scrounge up given the\
  \ state of the grocery stores.\nNot even a week before the neighborhood had been\
  \ under 4 feet of water and, in some places, as much as 9 feet. The roads were lined\
  \ with mountains of ruined belongings and debris. Imagine going around your house,\
  \ drawing a line at four feet up the wall. Everything below that line was now gone.\
  \ Drywall, flooring, furniture, everything that touched the water was a total loss.\
  \ 33 trillion gallons of water, polluted with human waste and toxic chemicals, flooded\
  \ the area. Over two hundred thousand homes had been affected by this disaster,\
  \ nearly four times as many houses as the entirety of my hometown. Yet, with 6.5\
  \ million people in the greater Houston area, it just felt like a drop in the bucket.\
  \ \nA few more blocks of destruction passed while I was lost in my head. I had spent\
  \ days tearing out the refuse. Working myself to the bone trying to prevent the\
  \ spread of black mold. Helping the desperate return to a semblance of normality.\
  \ Already it was impossible to be in most areas without a respirator and the situation\
  \ was getting more dire. \nJill\u2019s word echoed through my head, \u201CSometimes\
  \ the reason for why you are somewhere isn\u2019t for your benefit, but because\
  \ someone else needs your help\u201D\nThe whole reason I was on this stupid trip\
  \ was to help others, and look where it\u2019s lead me: Single, penniless, and homeless.\
  \ \nIt was at that moment I realized that I was completely lost. The remnants of\
  \ one ruined block appeared much like another. As I tried to get my bearings, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t comprehend what I was seeing. Bathed in the golden hue of a streetlight,\
  \ there was a large red van with \u201CERIE, PENNSYLVANIA\u201D  written on the\
  \ side of it. A small crowd was gathered by the tailgate.\nMy curiosity got the\
  \ better of me and I approached the Red Cross vehicle."
