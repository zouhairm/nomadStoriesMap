Text: "I reached Phnom Chisor in a small \"tuk-tuk\" through a muddy road. It was\
  \ merely a trail and climbed 600 steps up the mountain. The smiles of local children\
  \ greeted me at the entrance where two monstrous lions stood.Two grandmas were selling\
  \ raw mangoes and I stood there for a moment to inhale my childhood smell. I bought\
  \ one raw mango and a bite of it took me to my beloved place, my grandfathers house\
  \ where there were many mango trees and I enjoyed the raw mangoes in the summers.\
  \ \n\nI started climbing the small steps towards the temple that was hidden behind\
  \ a big Buddhist monastery. I turned around a corner and a majestic site greeted\
  \ me.\n\nThe broken stones were an essence of human scent here and there through\
  \ the red and blue flowers. The black and green stones laying all over the temple\
  \ were placed gently across the horizon as if he had lost his love and the sorrow\
  \ had made him for-lone.\n\"I have waited for you my love... for centuries...\"\
  \ whispered the handsome temple.\n\"Why are you broken? Does my touch sooth your\
  \ pain?\" - I asked.\n\"See through me, my love!\" \nI walked through, mesmerized...\
  \ Thinking... \n\nThe broken heart can feel the love and all tiredness washes away...\n\
  The cold stones gives pleasure and I watch across the square window into the curved\
  \ horizon.\nThe harsh edges brings an ecstatic happiness and I laugh out loud...\n\
  The empty chambers of the temple echos back and laughter gurgles through the broken\
  \ spaces rushes out through the doorways and corridors and quadrangles into a vast\
  \ landmass...\n\nI go back to time. There were people praying and the oil from their\
  \ lamp had trickled for ages making the stone darker. The turmeric and red color\
  \ on the goddess is still  vibrant. There were people praying different gods in\
  \ the same temple. There were people building blocks of small caves to stay in.\
  \ There were hymns gurgling through the stones and the birds had sang those songs\
  \ through time. There was laughter. There was beauty. There was peace.\nThe saffrons\
  \ of the Buddha had interposed with Red of the Goddess Kali. It was as if religion\
  \ didn't matter. It is only love that can be felt through the harsh stones which\
  \ embedded the secrets of lost lives. \nI was a messenger of this era. He had touched\
  \ my heart and in one such moment, I fell in love with this majestic temple who\
  \ was standing alone. \n \nFrom far  below you could see a single soul standing\
  \ across the huge gateway, waiting to etch a memory so that the love of this moment\
  \ may not be forgotten."
