Text: 'I don''t know from where should I begin but here I begin from childhood I have
  a curiosity for himalayas ,how it formed and what is there role for Indian subcontinent
  etc etc but when i got the first chance to visit the gateways to himalayas Haridwar
  and Rishikesh ,it was a treat to my dream that became true I enjoyed but one question
  arises to me that what is beyond these town so in 2012 after 10 years I got the
  chance to visit beyond Haridwar and Rishikesh,I trekked to 3500 MTR kedarnath temple
  around 300 km from Haridwar that was the beginning of my dream ,I was novice to
  himalayas at tha time no idea about geology and geography,next year I visited gangotri
  and gaumukh around 4000 MTR height that was 4 day trek I did in 2013  now my thirst
  for seeing himalayas is getting bigger,watching solo trekkers gives me motivation
  and I think that they are also find of himalayas,next year in august 2014 I visited
  badrinath and vasudhara falls that is also between 3000. -3500 MTR height now I
  am in the phase of becoming novice to experienced trekker and I am sure I will never
  forget till I die the experience the felling I got,next year 2015 I got married  and
  my wife is also enthusiastic about himalayas so we decided that we will celebrate
  our honeymoon in himalayas so this year we again did trek of 4500mtr height in valley
  of flowers Uttarakhand ,surely my love for my wife and himalayas is

  Synonymous I love both of them,in 2016 I along my wife visited world famous ladakh
  and explored many places around that place,and surely I can say it was like a bee
  on flower petal ,it was extremely beautiful.

  I love himalayas because of its beauty and people they are happy and they help us
  in every situation ..there are lot of situation in which people of himalayas helped,one
  thing I want that children of that region should get good education and also a good
  medical facilities,in the end I would like to say that I have tried to put my views
  in this story but as my mother language is not English I am not sure I have puted
  in proper way,I love himalayas and will dedicate my life for them,please give me
  oppurtunity to know the different world'
