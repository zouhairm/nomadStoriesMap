Text: "Being nearly blinded in one eye by a bug bite is not on any traveller's list\
  \ of must-dos, much less so in a country notorious for its lack of connection to\
  \ the outside world.\n\nCuban society operates in a way so different to others that\
  \ many tourists find it impossible to penetrate, particularly when complications\
  \ of currency, language and confusing public transport come into play.\n\nI now\
  \ had to navigate this world with one eye shut.\n\nI frantically dashed through\
  \ Vedado, the buildings morphing from concrete to neoclassical. My search for relief\
  \ landed me in a cheerless kiosk by the university. The store only accepted moneda\
  \ nacional - the local currency I had not yet acquired.\n\nI thought bitterly of\
  \ my previous destination, Mexico - but not of its glorious beaches, nor its atmospheric\
  \ ancient sites. I found myself nostalgic for convenience stores, for multinational\
  \ corporations, for a capitalism I resented but understood.\n\nTurning to leave,\
  \ I found myself face-to-face with a grinning, sympathetic student. He thrust a\
  \ bottle of water into my hands, waving away my attempt to reimburse him with valuable\
  \ convertible pesos. As did an elderly couple, later that day, at Coppelia - Cuba's\
  \ answer to an ice-cream chain. 'We're grandparents', they explained matter-of-factly.\n\
  \nThat night, Marisol steered me toward a deck chair and gently placed a damp cotton\
  \ pad over my eye. She knew I understood, but didn't speak, Spanish; she chattered\
  \ endlessly about Fidel, about baseball and about her un-Cuban hatred of smoking.\
  \ I tried to relax, my good eye focused on a pastel ceiling. But I have never been\
  \ one to sit still; much less to ask for help. Cuba not only thrust community on\
  \ me, but rendered me dependent upon it. \n\nThree weeks passed. I returned to Havana,\
  \ eye now healthy. I politely told Marisol - in crude Spanish - that smoking was\
  \ expensive in Australia; I wandered through Vedado, both convertibles and moneda\
  \ jangling in my pocket.\n\nDistracted by the thunder of the sea against the malec\xF3\
  n, I misjudged my steps and tumbled into the hot concrete. Blood trickled down my\
  \ leg from a substantial gash.\n\nWith no mirage of a supermarket chain in my mind\
  \ this time, I continued my walk to the museum. I was soon surrounded by a gaggle\
  \ of curators. Some held bandages and disinfectant. Others nodded at me sympathetically.\
  \ Others still were simply interested in the commotion. Somehow, all were an equally\
  \ important part of the process.\n\nMaybe I needed them, and maybe that was okay."
