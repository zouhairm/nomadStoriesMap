Text: "After 16 hours of a bus journey from Rosario, my hometown, I finally arrive\
  \ to Mercedes, Corrientes. The journey does not finish there; next, a van takes\
  \ us to Colonia Carlos Pellegrini. The asphalt transforms from a hard grey to a\
  \ deep red, which comes from the soil. That same soil invades the wheels of all\
  \ the cars. Almost as if it were a baptism with the nature showing you when you\
  \ enter its territory.\nLos Esteros Del Iber\xE1 always attracted me in a very incomprehensible\
  \ way. \nIt has been 21 hours since I am in the traffic; however, I do not feel\
  \ tired any more. The landscape soften all my senses. I am amazed at the animals\
  \ and vegetation that appear in front of me through the window.\nOnce I reach my\
  \ destination, Estrella and Jos\xE9 welcome me, they are husband and wife, and they\
  \ have two children, Marco and Joaqu\xEDn.\nJos\xE9 is one of my tour guide during\
  \ my stay. He takes me around the town and pointing at an old woman who is drinking\
  \ mate in her yard he tells, \u201CLook how much stress she has\u201D. She tells\
  \ me that her only worry is to know what she will eat today. She has animals, a\
  \ vegetable garden and a mud house. She does not need anything else to feel well,\
  \ to see her life going by.\nWe continue our sightseeing, he points at a house,\
  \ whose owner is a girl that has now two jobs, she could put everything to her house,\
  \ but she does not enjoy it. She is all day out to pay for her belongings.\nRoutine\
  \ happens; it is not forced. You eat when you are hungry; you sleep when you feel\
  \ tired.\nIn Colonia, time does not move slowly, it does not move directly. There\
  \ is no mobile phone signal, no lights in the street. A few places have WI FI and\
  \ just other few inns have a television antenna.  There you live the present time\
  \ intensively.\nEverything matches the rhythm of nature and in one of those excursions\
  \ at night, you are asked to turn off the flashlights and intensify your senses\
  \ in order to listen to the nature in its highest extent. \nThe silence is so immense\
  \ that can hug you; it invites you to listen to your pulses, to listen the music\
  \ that comes from you inner part.\nThe rhythm of you blood pumping synchronizes\
  \ with the red soil, the natural cycles and the sound from the grasshoppers, but\
  \ for all those things, it is necessary to make a stop in the pathway, to turn off\
  \ the lights, to stop the clock and listen. In that precise moment I understood,\
  \ why I should visit that place."
