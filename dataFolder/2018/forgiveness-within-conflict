Text: "There's a row of bullet holes scarring the street. It's hard to envision a\
  \ world where an endless echo of bullets passing through the air circumnavigating\
  \ you was all that kept you alive, or close to death. \n\nWar has no allies, only\
  \ enemies. It's during times like these that we forget the precious delicate intimacy\
  \ of life. Sarajevo, for most of the 90's was a city lying under a tarpaulin of\
  \ seige. Religion and Culture, which for the previous 50 years had bared the fruits\
  \ of a delicate fragile relationship were now lying under a sea of doubt. It's in\
  \ these moments, when our eyes glaze over naked plaster walls with a hundred bullet-holes\
  \ like a slither of memories, that we discover our fallacies, our own prestige that\
  \ we've never had to take a walk in these shoes. \n\nOur connection to this world\
  \ is vague at best. A little under 20 years before, ghosts walked these streets.\
  \ Military personnel with camouflaged khaki uniforms, carrying long black rifles,\
  \ stalked these streets, searching for anything that fit the label that they were\
  \ trained to erase from history. Shells and mortars rocked the city, cracks of violent\
  \ rage rampaged throughout the valley, the serenity disheveled by a thousand feasting\
  \ eyes hellbent of gunfire and anihilation - but why?\n\nIf you were raised to believe\
  \ a certain higher power, it was surely through environmental factors. If you were\
  \ raised to follow different cultural traditions, then you to were following a trail\
  \ of thought bred into you. Sarajevo lies at the crossroads of not one, but three\
  \ cultural crossroads: Bosniaks, Croatians and Serbians. It's denominational philosophies\
  \ spread to two forms of Christianity: Orthodox and Catholism, and one form of Islam.\
  \ It was a schitzophrenic city, inside a nation of three separate personalities\
  \ yet it carried with it the greatest of resilience. There was an eagerness to rebuild,\
  \ a beauty in the landscapes now sunk into the souls of the locals - Bosnia for\
  \ all of its grey, only had to be peeled back to reveal its shades of rainbow lights.\
  \ \n\nWhat Sarajevo taught me was that fear only stands in your way, if you dwell\
  \ among the ghosts. Strength lies not within the infathomable, it lies within the\
  \ obtainable. Today, memories of the past are there as guides to remind us of a\
  \ chapter in the past. Our stories are not yet completed, we are complex beings\
  \ with an acutely complex novel to complete."
