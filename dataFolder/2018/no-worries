Text: "One doesn\u2019t often go to Mexico for adventure. Not nowadays. Not really.\
  \ So I flew to Cancun without expecting anything like in Hollywood movies. \nI rented\
  \ a room in a private house in Tulum. The first thing I saw in the yard was an old\
  \ van, all rusted out, covered in graffiti, sporting one seat inside.\nLuis and\
  \ Ivan, friends of the house\u2019s owner, would normally be around somewhere, often\
  \ sleeping on the floor in the sitting room. One day Luis said they were going to\
  \ Mahahual and Bacalar for a couple of days.\n\n\u201CDo you want to come?\u201D\
  \ he asked. Of course I did.\n\u201CThen we\u2019ll put another wooden box into\
  \ the van to sit on.\u201D\n\u201CWhat? Does THIS van actually move?\u201D\n\u201C\
  No worries, the engine is new, the rest doesn\u2019t matter.\u201D\n\nSo, who said\
  \ Mexico wasn\u2019t for adventure anymore? The following day Luis and Ivan packed\
  \ the van with tents, their girlfriends, food, and other necessities.\n\nIn Mahahual\
  \ we found a nice spot to camp. The guys decided that erecting tents without beer\
  \ would be too complicated. Luis went back to the van, but 5 minutes later, it still\
  \ hadn\u2019t moved.\n\n\u201CDid you fall asleep in there?\u201D we asked.\n\n\
  Instead of a reply Luis waved in the air with the gear shifter. For this he had\
  \ to open the window. The glass lowered to its\u2019 normal limit and then continued\
  \ to sink through the rusted metal on the bottom of the door, falling to the ground.\
  \ Fortunately, it didn\u2019t break.\n\n\u201CNo worries,\u201D said Luis \u201C\
  I\u2019ll go to the shop on foot.\u201D\n\nWhen he got back we started a fire. We\
  \ talked about the weather, a hurricane was moving from Honduras to the north.\n\
  \n\u201CIt goes inland,\u201D Ivan said, \u201Cno worries, we\u2019re safe.\u201D\
  \n\nA few hours later the beer was finished, the tents were up, and the guys had\
  \ fixed the van window with a screwdriver wedged through the door.\n\nI went to\
  \ my tent to sleep. After a while the tent started shaking and dancing. A whistling\
  \ sound was growing louder and louder. The hurricane! I looked outside just in time\
  \ to see another tent flying past. The guys managed to catch it. Struggling with\
  \ the wind, we pulled the other tents down and went to sleep in the van. Despite\
  \ the wind lashing through all the uncountable holes, we were warm, 5 people in\
  \ a small van.\n\nIn the morning Ivan dismantled the gear box from under the floor\
  \ of the van, took the shifter and went in search of a mechanic. He was back in\
  \ 2 hours, put the fixed gear box back in place and tried to start the van. It worked!\n\
  When we headed off to Bacalar, we didn\u2019t realize it was only the start of our\
  \ adventure..."
