Text: "It was 8:00pm, when I emerged from the Cit\xE9 Metro Station on Line 4 in Paris,\
  \ France. Standing at street level at the top of the underground staircase, was\
  \ Aur\xE9lien, a French man I met the night before at a friend\u2019s gettogether\
  \ in a Le Marais bar. He was tall and handsome, and smiled as I neared. We were\
  \ on a first date in the oldest inhabited part of Paris, \xCEle de la Cit\xE9, (Island\
  \ of the City). We embraced each other with a hug and a kiss on both cheeks and\
  \ headed towards the iconic Notre-Dame Cathedral. \n\nThe mid-spring evening air\
  \ was crisp, as we walked along the shadows of Marie Antoinette\u2019s memory, where\
  \ centuries ago she was imprisoned in the nearby Conciergerie building, during the\
  \ French Revolution. In all the uncertainty and change in Parisian life, one thing\
  \ remained the same, Notre-Dame. \n\nThe plaza in front of the cathedral was filled\
  \ with locals and tourists from all over the world, admiring the illuminated western\
  \ facade. The structure loomed above everything in sight, with its two towers concealing\
  \ the famed bells of Notre-Dame. Its French Gothic architecture told the story of\
  \ the Catholic Church in France, with sculptures of the Portal of the Virgin, Last\
  \ Judgment and St. Anne. The stain glass windows painted the cathedral with colour,\
  \ as the gargoyle statues looked down upon us.\n\nEven though I was surrounded in\
  \ Parisian history, my attention was consumed by the sweet and charming man named\
  \ Aur\xE9lien. We continued our walk down Rue du Cloitre-Notre-Dame towards Pont\
  \ Saint-Louis, a bridge linking the two natural islands of the Seine river, in Paris.\
  \ While crossing into \xCEle Saint-Louis (Saint Louis Island), we passed a band\
  \ playing the Edith Piaf song, \u201CLa Vie en Rose\u201D. As the singer sang the\
  \ lyrics in French, Aur\xE9lien recited to me his English translation, \u201C\u2018\
  eyes that make mine kiss, a laugh that gets lost on his mouth\u2026 he is for me,\
  \ me for him.\u2019\u201D\n\nHe took hold of my hand, leading me along the cobblestone\
  \ and down a staircase that took us to the edge of the Seine river. We sat there\
  \ on a bench, where we chatted under the night\u2019s sky. Aur\xE9lien then gently\
  \ kissed me on the lips as it started to rain softly, but as his kisses intensified,\
  \ so did the downpour. We ran in the rain through the streets of Paris, before he\
  \ stopped to kiss me again, this time underneath the shelter of an archway. I slept\
  \ in his arms that night, for he showed me that there are genuine kind men out there,\
  \ who are caring and sweet. La vie est belle, (life is beautiful)."
