Text: "I can still taste the vomit in my mouth as we pull into the driveway. The car\
  \ rolls to a stop, and we sit completely still, aside from trembling hands and deep\
  \ breaths. We\u2019re alive.\n\u2026\nI step off the crowded, hot ferry and onto\
  \ the dock. I\u2019ve just returned from a short trip to Zanzibar. I look across\
  \ the parking lot and see Albert, my host family\u2019s driver, waiting for me.\
  \ I run into his arms; it feels like home. We can\u2019t speak the same language,\
  \ but it never seems to matter \u2014 we always understand one another. We climb\
  \ into the jeep as the sun sets, leaving the bustle of Dar es Salaam behind as we\
  \ make our way back to our small village 30 km away.\n\nThe roads are so dark. There\
  \ are no streetlights along this highway, and I start to focus on how dim the jeep\u2019\
  s headlights are; they do little to illuminate the road ahead. I have a weird feeling;\
  \ something doesn\u2019t feel right. Suddenly, I see him. A teenager, his innocent\
  \ face in the light before me. The sound of his fragile frame colliding with the\
  \ front of the car. And then he\u2019s gone, his body cloaked in darkness.\n\nHow\
  \ can so much unspoken communication happen in the span of two seconds? I look over\
  \ at Albert. He\u2019s afraid. He doesn\u2019t\u2019 want to stop; I can feel it.\
  \ I come from a place where you\u2019re expected to stop; he can feel it. Albert\
  \ starts to shake as he pulls the car over to the side of the road. I\u2019m scared,\
  \ too, but it\u2019s somehow obvious that our fears aren\u2019t the same. He understands\
  \ things I don\u2019t. Not yet.\n\nWe\u2019re in a dimly lit area now, and I suddenly\
  \ see a mob of people coming at us from all directions. Albert scrambles to roll\
  \ up his window as someone throws a giant rock in the direction of his head. An\
  \ angry crowd claws at the car, beats on the doors and windows. As quickly as we\
  \ made the unspoken decision to pull over, we make a similar silent decision \u2014\
  \ to get the fuck out of there.\n\nAlbert lays his foot on the gas, and we speed\
  \ away. In the rear-view mirror, I see a group of men climb into a white pick-up\
  \ truck. They try to catch up to us as Albert weaves between cars on the road. I\
  \ roll down the window; I can taste seasickness from earlier today in the back of\
  \ my throat. Albert tries to pull me back inside, afraid of the men catching up\
  \ to us. I black out.\n\nI come to just as we pull into the driveway. Our friends\
  \ stare at my vomit splattered across the side of the car. I\u2019ve never felt\
  \ so afraid in all my life, but somehow we\u2019ve lost them, we\u2019ve made it,\
  \ and we\u2019re alive. But is the young boy?\n\nWe\u2019ll never know."
