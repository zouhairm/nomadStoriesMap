Text: "\u201CA man who does not feed on his dreams grows old soon\u201D W. Shakespeare\n\
  \nIt was a cold morning; the wind hit my face, a blast of icy air when I got out\
  \ of my car. I had the feeling that morning of being absorbed into an enchanted\
  \ realm. \n\nI started climbing up the first hill; it seemed like being inside an\
  \ amazing story by Tolkien. Surrounded by the greenest fields that one has ever\
  \ seen I began to feel the fresh air shaking my hair while the forest rustled \n\
  \nSo imagine yourself in a place with a secret story, a torrent of questions plaguing\
  \ your mind. \u201CWhat could have happened here years ago?\u201D \u201CA battle?\u201D\
  \ \u201CCould this be some kind of giants\u2019 settlement?\u201D The limits of\
  \ your fun are set by your imagination, and that was what happened to me when I\
  \ lost my mind inside the Fairy Glen.\n\nFinally, similar to certain moments in\
  \ one\xB4s life I reached the peak of the highest hill and there it was before me,\
  \ the absolutely stunning Fairy Glen, surrounded by hills, a forest and a very colorful\
  \ dale with a lovely small lagoon as well. Also, while I was waking up from this\
  \ enchanting dream, I discovered the last thing that I would have never expected,\
  \ some awesome ruins which immediately took my breath away, an ancient castle above\
  \ a hill and which seemed to be under a staggeringly beautiful spell. \n \n\nImmersed\
  \ in this enchantment, I started running over the hills ahead, losing my mind in\
  \ the Scottish landscape and its folklore, feeling like a highlander, wielding a\
  \ sword to face the red jackets during the eighteenth century and fighting for the\
  \ rights and freedom of the Scottish people.\nIt was as if I were escaping from\
  \ a persecution, giving free rein to my creativity. That is the magic of Scotland,\
  \ the Isle of Skye and the highlands; they submerge you in a Gaelic world where\
  \ one wears a kilt like a pure highlander. \n\nFollowing the path, I abandoned the\
  \ route to pursue the sound of the wildlife and the flight of the seagulls with\
  \ the aim of reaching the coast. It was at that moment when the wind carried with\
  \ it the sound of the waves, the call of that rough sea, its indomitable soul and\
  \ angry tides. But always after the storm comes the calm.\n\nThe sky was quite clear\
  \ and the sun shone above the clouds, forming elegant golden shades and then I saw\
  \ it, a white shore and a perfect bay for any wandering soul in need of rest from\
  \ their trip. An idyllic place to feel free and lose the horizon, a haven of peace,\
  \ I stared at nothing and thought about everything."
