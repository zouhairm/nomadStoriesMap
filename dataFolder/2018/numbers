Text: "Its mid afternoon in a beer tent on the outskirts of Hanoi, and on our last\
  \ few days of a month long trip in Vietnam. I am there to get lost in a visual chaos;\
  \ to distract myself from the internal turmoil that has plagued me for the last\
  \ year since leaving a high demand group\u2026or the word we all dread being associated\
  \ with, A cult. \n\nWe had come in search of our favourite dish. A sour tofu, tomato\
  \ dish and a cold glass of beer Hanoi. The place was packed. We stood out as tourists\
  \ and the only women in sight. We quickly became a source of conversational hum\
  \ for the groups of older gentlemen. \n\nBefore we knew it we had ten very elegantly\
  \ dressed men all in their 60\u2019s sitting and laughing at our table insisting\
  \ they share their bottle of Vietnamese wine as they find out we are Canadians.\
  \ \n\nA kind, stoic in disposition, man who had been quieter then the rest reaches\
  \ out to shake both of our hands.  Under a single shirt cuff, the turbulent history\
  \ of Vietnam comes to life, as the sleeve pulls back from his arm revealing a tiny\
  \ series of numbers tattooed across his wrist. His POW tattoo.\n\n In that moment\
  \ every Viet Cong tunnel, airplane remains, and photographs in every museum we had\
  \ seen during the trip had humanized the horrors of war with a humbling realization\
  \ that this is still very fresh and just a few short decades ago.\n\nThe man winked\
  \ with a tiny grin.  It was a tiny moment of the past coming to meet us in the middle.\
  \ A cross cultural, cross generational therapy session if you will.   We may carry\
  \ pieces of the past with us into the present, they may shape who we are but not\
  \ we we become. We as humans choose who we want to be. We are resilient."
