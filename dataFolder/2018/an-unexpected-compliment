Text: "The damp air of Chicago hit my face and I snuggled into my fur jacket. My heart\
  \ started to beat like a hammer and I felt a shiver go up in my spine. First time\
  \ travelling all alone was going to be the best experience of my life, my sister\
  \ had told me but I couldn\u2019t understand why I was so nervous about. \nI was\
  \ 19 years old, spending an exchange semester in USA. I had lived a protected life\
  \ back in my home city in Pakistan. Venturing to Chicago alone from my university\
  \ in Memphis had been my decision. I wanted to break my fear of being on my own\
  \ and wanted to develop self confidence which I knew would only come when I venture\
  \ into horizons unknown all on my own. \nMy first stop was going to be Millennium\
  \ Park. I could not believe it! I was finally going to see the Cloud Gate, which\
  \ I had only viewed in Hollywood movies! I made my way through the traffic and took\
  \ a million pictures in front of the significant sculpture. The sun beamed through\
  \ the damp air and finally, my confidence was settling in. \nI turned away to embark\
  \ on my next destination when I felt someone tap me on my shoulder. I turned around\
  \ to see a girl-around ten years old-in pink shirt, her shoulder length auburn hair\
  \ gleaming against the sun beams. She gave a wide smile: \u201CYou should just know\
  \ that you are very beautiful! I love your skin color, I wish I had it.\u201D\n\
  I was dumb founded. I had always been extremely insecure about my dark skin color;\
  \ many times, relatives in Pakistan had made me feel that I was not beautiful enough.\
  \ And here, this little girl, who did not even know me, took out time to tell me\
  \ she loved it. I was speechless for five seconds, thanked this little girl and\
  \ shared with her a miniature camel that I had bought all the way from Pakistan.\
  \ The girl and her mother were visiting Chicago from Utah and invited me to stay\
  \ over at Utah with them. \nThat little girl is 14 years old today. I am her biggest\
  \ confidant since 4 years now. She pours her heart out to me over email and I share\
  \ my daily musings with her. Who would have thought that a little compliment will\
  \ turn into an everlasting friendship, spanning more than 4 years? I am getting\
  \ married this year. Kate and her mother will be coming to Pakistan where I will\
  \ host them in Karachi. I am mesmerized at the wonders that take place in this world\
  \ and this one encounter has encouraged me to travel all over the world, alone.\
  \ Because, who know, which new friends I could possibly meet?"
