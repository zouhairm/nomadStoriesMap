Text: "It was February, I had just gotten back from spending the holidays back home\
  \ in New York City. Here I was again in Los Angeles, a new year but my soul yearning\
  \ for more than the cultureless environment I\u2019ve chosen to live in. Seeing\
  \ stars at the film studio I work at just doesn\u2019t fill the hunger I feel. I\
  \ needed to experience more. I needed a \u201Csoul cleanse\u201D. Where can I go\
  \ for a soul cleanse, on my own, that isn\u2019t too far in case I chicken out?\
  \ It came to me almost immediately. San Francisco. It has culture, art, the outdoors.\
  \ Yes! I spent three days researching the perfect Airbnb. Learning what each neighborhood\
  \ had to offer and which one sounded the most \u201Cme\u201D. I found the perfect\
  \ spot in Pacific Heights. The host herself was a traveler, and since this was my\
  \ first time doing this I wanted to land somewhere wher I could lean on a local\
  \ expert. I then booked a bay tour cruise, a tour of Mt. Muir and an evening drinks\
  \ tour in North Beach. I\u2019d return back to LA the next day at 2pm. With enough\
  \ time to have breakfast by myself at the mission or somewhere in between. \nWhen\
  \ I arrived in San Francisco, I was stunned and enamored by the fact that I could\
  \ smell the bay from the airport. My plane had been delayed by an hour so I was\
  \ in a terrible mood up until that very moment when the smell of the water hit my\
  \ nose. As my Lyft driver and I cruised through the hills and up to my pacific heights\
  \ Airbnb. I fell even harder for this charming little city. My host and I ended\
  \ up staying up until midnight chatting about life. The next day I befriended a\
  \ couple from Dallas who was on my same bay cruise tour and mt Muir tour. At night,\
  \ turns out I was the only one who had signed up for the drinks tour so my tour\
  \ guide invited her friends. When the tour ended at 9:30pm. We decided we would\
  \ stay friends and we all just kept eating and drinking in North Beach. The Dallas\
  \ couple came and joined us, and bought everyone drinks. So there we were these\
  \ out-of-towners having the time of our lives with the locals. We had breakfast\
  \ near the mission district the next day, and I headed to the airport with a full\
  \ belly and a full heart. I went alone, but left feeling like I\u2019d made a lifetime\
  \ of friendships. It was all very \u201Ceat,pray,love\u201D, but in 24 hours and\
  \ in San Francisco. I had never done anything like that for myself. I felt so proud\
  \ of myself. I felt so alive. I felt rewarded by the universe. I\u2019ve never been\
  \ the same. The question is, where will I go to next?"
