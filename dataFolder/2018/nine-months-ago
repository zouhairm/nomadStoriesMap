Text: "My heart still feels excited because there's something I can't believe... \
  \ Have you ever had the feeling of not being in the place where you know you are?\
  \ At this moment there are more than 14,000 km away from my old home in Mexico but\
  \ my brain is not able to realize the distance, I'm in Vietnam and 9 months ago,\
  \ I didn't even think about this country; maybe some references of a war and the\
  \ image of a cone-shaped hat were the only things that came to my mind if I heard\
  \ that name.\n\nVietnam has taught me to be happy through the kindness of people,\
  \ the place is amazing, and I love everything I see, but I'm not going to describe\
  \ landscapes and pagodas with huge golden Buddha's that will leave you speechless.\
  \ I'm going to talk about how people here change your life, how they smile and talk\
  \ to you on the street, even if you're very sorry to say: \"I don't speak Vietnamese\"\
  .\n\nBeing Vietnamese means more than eating noodles and loving rice, it means having\
  \ a smile every day, it means getting lost in a multitude of motorbikes that have\
  \ no order or sense while you try to dodge the noise and chaos wrapped in the smell\
  \ of food that chases you all over the city. Also means forgetting, not having grudges,\
  \ moving forward, not wondering why the world is upside down and why nothing now\
  \ seems real. Being Vietnamese means to have small eyes but a big smile, and when\
  \ you see that, even if you had the worst day of your life, you won't be able to\
  \ avoid smiling back. \n\nYou've surely heard that when you hit bottom you should\
  \ be happy because you have nothing else to lose, you just have to go to the other\
  \ side to go out and it's absolutely real. At the darkest point of my existence\
  \ I thought that there was nothing in life to be happy for, I felt so sad that I\
  \ turned my life into a checklist routine and a I felt that it did not matter if\
  \ I was here or not , it seemed that nobody was going to need me and in the middle\
  \ of that sadness I realized that it was true, nobody needed me because nobody needs\
  \ anyone, everyone's life continues with or without you, but then you realize that\
  \ the only person you need is you and now that you're in the train of life at least\
  \ you have to take that train into the places that will make you happy. And that's\
  \ when I made the decision to start this trip, looking for experiences that help\
  \ me to fix my heart. \n\nSo, If you think you're alone and the world is too cold\
  \ to you, take a flight, come to Vietnam and let them fill your heart with happiness\
  \ and rice."
