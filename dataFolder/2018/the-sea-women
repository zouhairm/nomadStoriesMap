Text: "The woman bobbed in the ocean, little white waves lapping gently against a\
  \ jet-black wetsuit that glistened in the morning sunlight. I could see a small\
  \ round face, lined with age and framed by long dark hair streaked with pearls of\
  \ seawater. \n \nShe floated for a while, taking time to regain the strength needed\
  \ for another dive. Then she pulled the round mask down over her eyes and took a\
  \ long, deep breath before rolling forward and disappearing into the cold clear\
  \ waters.\n \nIt started with a rumour of mermaids down by the sea shore. \u201C\
  You must go and see\u201D the barman had whispered with a smile, conspiracy written\
  \ across his lips. \u201CBecause if you aren\u2019t quick, they might slip away\
  \ into the ocean forever.\u201D \n  \nOver cheap shots of soju \u2013 the local\
  \ spirit that tastes like lashes of fire \u2013 I learned where I might glimpse\
  \ a Haenyeo, one of the legendary Sea Women that inhabit the tropical Korean island\
  \ of Jeju. It mattered not that I couldn\u2019t swim, nor would my fear of water\
  \ hold me back. I knew at once that I had to meet one.\n  \nIt was down at the water\u2019\
  s edge that I finally found her. She was one of a group but my eye was immediately\
  \ drawn to her \u2013 old, even by the standards of the Haenyeo, perhaps more than\
  \ 80. She was already eager to enter the sea, dressed in black and wearing the large\
  \ flippers that would propel her into the depths on a single breath.\n \nSalty spray\
  \ stung my eyes as I watched them prepare. The women gathered on the rocks, nodding\
  \ in agreement that the signs were promising; today would be a good day for diving.\
  \ I perched nearby, watching as they slung their baskets and floats over their shoulders\
  \ and then launching themselves into the ocean.\n\nThese women were doing something\
  \ special. Together they worked, diving in turns to the sea floor in search of the\
  \ conch shells that would bring them prosperity. One would always keep look out;\
  \ the currents here are treacherous and not every Haenyeo always makes it back to\
  \ shore.\n \nIt went on for hours; the old woman filling her floating basket, pausing\
  \ for breath and then diving back into the depths. On land she was frail and slow,\
  \ but in the sea she was free, soaring like an angel levitating in the twilight.\n\
  \nUntil, finally, the baskets were full and the Haenyeo swam back to shore \u2013\
  \ exhausted but content with the day\u2019s catch. And as I watched these women\
  \ of the sea slowly trudge away I felt a conflicting mixture of amazement and deep\
  \ sadness, secretly ashamed at my own reluctance to enter the water."
