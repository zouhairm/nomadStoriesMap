Text: "I was homesick. The pain in my shoulder from my pack was unbearable. My blisters\
  \ were raw and blending together. It was my birthday and I yearned to be with family.\
  \ My guide, Gautam, handed me a Mars bar and said warmly, \u201CRemember this. The\
  \ tough and painful parts. It is easy to remember only the good, but you should\
  \ remember and enjoy the bad as well. It makes the good better and the experience\
  \ real.\u201D I smiled and nodded, but I really just wanted to lie down. \n\nThe\
  \ Himalayas are like no other place on earth. No mountains feel so cold and harsh,\
  \ yet somehow warm and inviting. They draw you in. You can\u2019t get enough. Trekking\
  \ in the land of snow leopards and avalanches makes you feel a lack of control that\
  \ is terrifying. Yet, the crisp air and raw beauty of the landscape evoke a feeling\
  \ of unparalleled power and joy. No pain is enough to keep you from wanting more.\
  \ Every stimulation, no matter how sharp or soft, is warranted and appreciated.\
  \ \n\nLiving a birthday in the Himalayas is a gift in itself - truly. Yet, in the\
  \ last few miles that day, I felt a stronger urge to quit than I\u2019d ever experienced.\
  \ Gautam looked back at me with an encouraging glance. Was there mischief in his\
  \ eyes? I wearily placed one foot in front of the other, wondering why he was rushing.\n\
  \nWhen we finally arrived, I was so tired, I didn\u2019t question the large number\
  \ of people sitting in the small home where we would stay. Through the hot jab of\
  \ pain in my shoulder, I slowly started to hear what Gautam was saying. That twinkle\
  \ in his eye shone brighter. The smiling faces that filled the room slowly came\
  \ into focus, and in their midst, the unimaginable: a birthday cake with my name\
  \ on it. Here, in the Himalayas.\n\nSuddenly, the pain evaporated. Even with my\
  \ pack weighing me down, I felt light. All I had hoped for was a bed. Instead, I\
  \ received a great act of kindness. These beautiful people wrapped me in warm hugs\
  \ and bright smiles. They played music and sang blessings. As if through magic,\
  \ they had brought me home for my birthday.\n\nI had heard Gautam\u2019s words on\
  \ the trail, but they didn\u2019t resonate until I sat there, in that small mountain\
  \ village, surrounded by my family of strangers. Time slowed down as I watched the\
  \ ancient Shaman play a beautifully-carved, three-string instrument. In an instant\
  \ I\u2019d been pulled from exhaustion into elation. The stark contrast of a low\
  \ moment and a high one took my breath away."
