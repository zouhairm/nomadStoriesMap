Text: "My first cat was named Portia. She was a tiny marmalade-coloured fluff-ball,\
  \ given to me on my first birthday. She was there when I took my first step, on\
  \ my first day of school, when Mum became sick, and when Dad left. Amidst my ruined\
  \ life, she was a constant. We became nomads, and every time we moved, Portia would\
  \ hide in the packing boxes, yowling until Mum rubbed butter into her paws. During\
  \ our ninth move, Portia was attacked by another cat. She lost the ability to clean\
  \ herself and her eye oozed a horrible, strange pus. Mum would spend hours rubbing\
  \ medication into her wounds, singing quietly to her. When Portia died, Mum yowled,\
  \ and all the butter in the world couldn\u2019t soothe her. The next house didn\u2019\
  t have a cat. It wasn\u2019t home.\n\nYears later, my nomadic life led me to Rome.\
  \ I love its grimy cobbled streets and baroque wonders. I feel comfortable amongst\
  \ its chaos. One day, I stumbled across Largo di Torre Argentina, an ancient square\
  \ with four Roman Republican Temples and the remains of Pompey\u2019s theatre. It\
  \ was the site of Julius Caesar\u2019s murder. Like most ruins in Rome, it is now\
  \ a series of grass-covered low walls and columns. This one is different though.\
  \ In 1929, when the ruins were excavated, the lower-than-street-level tranquillity\
  \ encouraged local stray cats. \u201CGattare\u201D, or cat ladies, would feed them.\
  \ Decades later, in 1993, two women used an underground cavern to store food to\
  \ feed the cats. It is now an underground cat sanctuary. \n\nI felt something against\
  \ my leg. His eyelids were stuck together. He looked bedraggled, a marmalade-coloured\
  \ fluff-ball. He meowed and pawed my leg. I sat down. He jumped on to my lap. He\
  \ stayed for hours. I felt at home.\n\nDonations to the Largo Torre di Argentina\
  \ Cat Sanctuary can be made\n at http://www.romancats.com/torreargentina/en/introduction.php"
