Text: "The Sleeping Woman\n\nWhenever we looked up we had to lower our gaze: look\
  \ at the ground, embrace the earth. This is a land where land means everything,\
  \ and if you forget the trembling of culture within its earthquakes and stepping\
  \ of revolutionary painters, non-invited conquerors, and deep beliefs, there is\
  \ no place for you here. \nFar-off the Blue House of Fridha Kahlo and her heart-breaking\
  \ old, yet current paintings of fetuses and broken bones, lie the stones of impressive\
  \ civilisations of nomads who settled for a while, and if the eye is keen, one is\
  \ able to see the pyramids from Mexico City as if  some oneiric adventure mixed\
  \ with hot chilli intensity stumbles upon. This, is pure fire of ancient wars and\
  \ fast-pumping hearts, and spirit like this, makes me grateful. Yet, pyramids aren\xB4\
  t the only ones that claim fire in the heart. I always look for mountains. Wherever\
  \ I go. \n\nThe Popocateptl was in my mind already, long before I truly stepped\
  \ in front of the path that leads the way up, where a sign clearly states: \xB4\
  Do not go further\xB4. The roar could happen any moment. I could see the boys from\
  \ a scene previously depicted by a friend, avoiding stones, avoiding death. \nI\
  \ had to concentrate, I had a different peril in my bag: to achieve my first high-mountain\
  \ experience. We went left, leaving the prohibition to its own end on the right.\
  \ In front of \xB4El Popo\xB4,another awe-inspiring volcano rested in its own glory.\
  \ She was not active anymore. And she, was a she: Iztacc\xEDhuatl, \xB4The sleeping\
  \ woman\xB4. My boyfriend\xB4s face was white. The girl is 17.15879 feet high. \n\
  The plan, was to rest at 12.795.28 feet and wake up at 12 PM, pitch dark, to go\
  \ straight up the woman\xB4s knee, breast, and finally her head. By 7pm the tent\
  \ was made, we finished our cup of tea, and went to sleep. Easy. At 12, I woke up\
  \ and prepared the backpack. I even got to drink another cup of hot tea and suddenly,\
  \ I wanted to throw up. I wanted to sit down immediately. My legs were trembling\u2026\
  altitude, had created a void.\n\nWhen I entered the car I realised ice had eaten\
  \ the windows outside and inside with a thin layer, the same way the mountain\xB4\
  s body had swallowed me. The film I started to hallucinate varied. The boys were\
  \ running away from lava down the mountain, indians escaping the Spanish, the blood\
  \ of Aztec sacrifices poured, the green of the jungle, the turquoise of the sea,\
  \ the veins of the country\u2026 This, was undeniably the first of many climbs.\
  \ Ice sets in, and I waited."
