Text: "\u201CColleen!\u201D I said, shaking my friend\u2019s shoulder while she snoozed\
  \ in our shared room. \u201CThey\u2019re here!\u201D \n\nI pronounced this as if\
  \ \u201Cthey\u201D were physical beings whose hands we could shake in greeting.\
  \ She glanced out the window to confirm what I had seen, and then we sprang into\
  \ action. Our heads racing faster than our fingers, we struggled zipping up coats\
  \ and shoving fingers into gloves before dashing out into the hallway. We pushed\
  \ open the doors of our guesthouse and stumbled out into Grundarfj\xF6rdur, Iceland.\
  \ Immediately, the freezing night air pounced on us, and there were hardly any lights\
  \ illuminating the town, save for little green streaks spreading their fingers across\
  \ the sky.\n\nWhen we first set out on this journey to circumnavigate the Ring Road\
  \ in late October, seeing the Northern Lights, amazingly, wasn\u2019t on my to do\
  \ list. A year and a half prior, Colleen and I had taken a month-long backpacking\
  \ trip through Europe, with every day meticulously planned out and every train ticket,\
  \ hostel, and tour booked in advance. \n\nNow in Iceland, on a two-week vacation\
  \ from my first post-grad job, I just wanted the room to do whatever we wanted,\
  \ whenever we wanted to do it. \n\nOur beige Suzuki Vitara, who we named Gaud\xED\
  , would be our train and bus tickets. In exchange for castles and museums, we had\
  \ Iceland\u2019s strange, dramatic terrain, its volcanic peaks rising above unearthly\
  \ lava fields and winding glacial rivers tumbling into waterfalls. If we happened\
  \ to stumble upon the Aurora Borealis, great. But Colleen had already spotted them\
  \ on a previous trip to this country, and I was content to leisurely drive and see\
  \ what we found. In other words, we weren\u2019t making any special effort to chase\
  \ down the Northern Lights.\n\nBut just a few days before our journey was to end,\
  \ we found ourselves gazing across the water at Kirkjufell Mountain, an emerald\
  \ glow illuminating its silhouette. Across the sky, the Aurora Borealis filled in\
  \ the spaces between the stars. At first, other travelers squealed in delight as\
  \ camera shutters fluttered. But the excitement eventually gave way to a communal,\
  \ awestruck silence. Even the cool air, once so unkind, now felt refreshing, as\
  \ the Northern Lights reminded us of the wonders that were out there and the possibilities\
  \ they held. And I realized how lucky I was that the universe, in a rare show of\
  \ mercy, had put something in front of my face that I should have been seeking but,\
  \ stupidly, wasn\u2019t."
