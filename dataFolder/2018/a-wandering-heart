Text: "Feels like home, I could live here. The thoughts come easily as another city\
  \ disappears from view hidden by clouds, a peaceful mountain retreat shrinks in\
  \ the rear vision mirror, a colourful port town leaves the memory card in my camera\
  \ full.  These thoughts return, time after time, I\u2019m giving my heart away like\
  \ an unfaithful lover.\nAnd so it begins again. I find myself disconnected from\
  \ my normality, the allure of the unknown, amidst it all again. The unfamiliar skyline\
  \ of hundreds of high rise apartments, the dramatic white caps of the Andes form\
  \ the horizon, far from the flat coastal plain of Perth left behind. Rugged castles\
  \ and cobbled streets that trick the mind as they straddle each other first above\
  \ and then below, in existence for a thousand years, my Australian mind can\u2019\
  t comprehend. The smells and stickiness of a market, beetle juice on the ground,\
  \ a billum bag swung over a shoulder, a language that I feel I should understand\
  \ but can\u2019t. Vehicles of all shapes and size vying for a piece of the road\
  \ in a city of millions where rules are just guidelines and horns reign supreme\
  \ while I try to stay within the lines.\nYet my mind somehow finds its way to the\
  \ familiar, always searching to connect the new experience with those locked in\
  \ the mind\u2019s recesses. While in a Latin American city, I watch a young family\
  \ sitting only a few metres from me and feelings from half a lifetime and half a\
  \ world away return. On a western Scottish isle at the end of the world, guitar\
  \ playing youths sit on a jetty at dusk, my senses transporting me to a warm Moluccan\
  \ island night, a childhood visit to my father\u2019s homeland, where every gathering\
  \ involved a guitar, often a jetty and an abundance of laughter. A misty, humid\
  \ city on a clifftop where it never rains and dominating my thoughts is the question\
  \ of which place in Australia it is most like, the answer is none!  A morning walk\
  \ through a foreign urban streetscape may not be my usual suburbia but it is still\
  \ just a morning walk, a chance to clear my head and calm my heart. Conversations\
  \ with the old and the young, the exiles and the ones who stayed that allow me the\
  \ ongoing discovery of humanity, one that I find matches my own experience and shows\
  \ me I belong.\nThe excitement of holding the map for a new destination gives way\
  \ to the confidence that comes from recognition of my surrounds and suddenly it\u2019\
  s not so foreign, and maybe I\u2019m not so foreign either, and there goes my heart."
