Text: "\u201CDuck, duck, duck\u2026.clear!\u201D I yell to my fellow travellers, packed\
  \ into the back tray of a ute, driving through thick scrub in rural Cambodia, somewhere\
  \ between Siem Reap and Battambong.  Slowly they raise their heads, looking forward\
  \ past the cabin for any signs of civilisation and wonder how much longer we have\
  \ of this.  All we can see is scrub.\n\nI\u2019m travelling with three of my girlfriends,\
  \ backpacking our way around Cambodia.  Karen had heard of a fantastic Khmer cooking\
  \ course in Battambong, a town renowned for it\u2019s French colonial architecture\
  \ and as the last strong hold of the Khmer Rouge regime.  The travel agent in Siem\
  \ Reap told us it would take four hours to get there, and in true Cambodian style,\
  \ it takes eleven.  However, that\u2019s part of the attraction of Cambodia -  it\u2019\
  s an unpredictable adventure.\n\nHaving finally arrived, we head to a local restaurant\
  \ called \u201CThe Smoking Pot\u201D.  The owner, Vaneek, cooks up delicious Khmer\
  \ Thai infused dishes and we sign up for the cooking class the very next day.\n\n\
  First stop, Vaneek takes us on a tour of the local market to buy the food fresh.\
  \  He introduces us to fruit and vegetables that aren\u2019t common at home - dragon\
  \ fruit, mangosteen, star fruit, rambutan, milk fruit, soursops, longans, lemuts,\
  \ toleps, sarays, water apples and durians.  Down the meat aisle we see the variety\
  \ of meat that is eaten in Cambodia - skinned frogs, small birds, crickets, tarantulas,\
  \ chickens, beef and catfish all laid out on table tops.  Fridges and freezers are\
  \ not common, and later on we see two guys on the back of a ute with massive blocks\
  \ of ice that they chip and drop off to the restaurants each morning.\n\nBack at\
  \ the restaurant, we pick four dishes and are given the recipes.  Khmer Curry, Khmer\
  \ Fried Mushrooms with Pork, Tom Kha Gai (Chicken in Coconut Milk Soup) and Tom\
  \ Yam Goong (Hot and Sour Prawn Soup).  Vaneek may have battered pots and pans,\
  \ but he could out cook me any day!  Whilst waiting for the meals to cook, we asked\
  \ Vaneek about his life during the reign of the Khmer Rouge back in the 70\u2019\
  s.  He and his family escaped Cambodia and ended up in a refugee camp on the Thai\
  \ border.  Many of his family were killed.\n\nI highly recommend including a cooking\
  \ course in your next itinerary: it gives you such an extraordinary opportunity\
  \ to interact with locals; learn about their background and traditions; plus pick\
  \ up new skills that you can bring back home.  I will definitely be including this\
  \ on my itinerary in the future."
