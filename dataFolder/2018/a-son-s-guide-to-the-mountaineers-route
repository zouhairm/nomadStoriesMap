Text: "My trail guide pulled the orange helmet and rope out of the back of his F-150.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but ask, \u201CWhat the hell are those for?\u201D. My dad\u2019\
  s response, \u201CYou never know...\u201D put me on edge. It\u2019s tough having\
  \ your dad as a trail guide. It\u2019s personal and now it was about to get dangerous.\
  \ \n\nMt. Whitney, the crown jewel of California and the contiguous US. boasts its\
  \ highest point at 14,495 feet high. When words like, \u2018Mountaineers route\u2019\
  , \u2018class 4 climb\u2019 and \u2018possible death\u2019 started to enter the\
  \ conversation, I began to worry. \u201CWhat exactly is a class 4 climb?\u201D\n\
  \n\u201C4 is easy enough. Think of it as climbing straight up with your hands and\
  \ feet, just not on a solid granite wall. It is the first of the classes that can\
  \ be classified as fatal.\u201D he confidently poured out his knowledge, as if out\
  \ of a textbook. My heart sank in my stomach at my father\u2019s poor bedside manner\
  \ and we began without further question.\n\nMy pack, 40 lbs, seemed like a feather\
  \ compared the weight of dread of what awaited us. By midday we reached the final\
  \ assault. A waterfall of stone spilled down the corner of the mountain showing\
  \ us our path. Ever so carefully we made it to the precipice 800 feet up.\n\n\u201C\
  Whew. That was tough, but not too bad!\u201D I extorted. My father grimaced, \u201C\
  That wasn\u2019t the class 4 climb, this next part is, 200 feet up.\u201D\n\nI was\
  \ climbing the stairs of a giant. A sea of loose rock fell two or three thousand\
  \ feet below me. The ranger was right, certain death seemed like a real possibility.\
  \ Suddenly I slipped, ever slightly. I looked down in horror as the loosed pebbles\
  \ dramatically bounced ledge to ledge below me.\n\nI was in over my head, stuck\
  \ on a mountainside. Air escaped my lungs, my heart exploded yet I weakly muttered,\
  \ \u201CDaaaad. I...I\u2019m stuck.\u201D \n\nHe cursed under his breath, \u201C\
  What do you mean? Stuck?\u201D \n\n\u201CI\u2019m stuck, I can\u2019t go anywhere.\u201D\
  \ We paused, both stuck.\n\n\u201CYou have two options. You can go up or you can\
  \ go down. But you can\u2019t stay there.\u201D his words bellowed while he remained\
  \ out of sight, on the mountainside. There would be no rescue helicopter, no sudden\
  \ transportation device from a starship, no magic carpet ride. My eyes closed. I\
  \ breathed. I reached up and felt the ledge. I think I blacked out as I scrambled.\
  \ Eventually, I felt it. Flat rock. All the way up to my elbow. I lurched my body\
  \ over the edge to the top. On my back, facing the sun, I gulped the thin mountain\
  \ air. I was king of the mountain until my dad found me and said, \u201CGood job,\
  \ now its time to go back.\u201D"
