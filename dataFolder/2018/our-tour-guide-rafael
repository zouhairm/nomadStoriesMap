Text: "In October, 2015 my boyfriend and I headed back to Central America, this time\
  \ to Nicaragua. We had backpacked Costa Rica the summer prior. We were excited to\
  \ explore a new country in Central America because we had fallen in love with it.\
  \ In all honesty though, I was nervous about backpacking Nicaragua. From what I\
  \ had read, it\u2019s much less developed than Costa Rica, the crime rate is higher,\
  \ and there aren\u2019t as many tourists, which always makes me feel safer and more\
  \ secure. All my butterflies fluttered away once I left the plane and began engaging\
  \ with the local people of Nicaragua. They were some of the nicest, kindest people\
  \ around. \n\nOur first stop was Leon. We stayed at a lovely hostel called La Tortuga.\
  \ We booked all of our tours through them on arrival. On our last day in Leon we\
  \ went on a \u201CTurtle Tour\u201D, which was a boat ride at sunset to a beach\
  \ where we would release baby turtles. The organization\u2019s goal is to keep the\
  \ ocean populated with turtles that have become endangered. The trip was absolutely\
  \ magical and memorable. Ironically, when I think back to our tour, the memory of\
  \ the tiny, baby turtles scurrying to the ocean with the sun setting in the distance\
  \ isn\u2019t my first though, but of a man named Rafael. \n\nRafael was our tour\
  \ guide. Rafael told of us his life, his struggles, his hopes, and his dreams. He\
  \ explained that had been working as a tour guide for many years. He had dreams\
  \ of being a journalist to expose the injustices Nicaragua faces, at the hands of\
  \ other countries as well as it\u2019s own government. Rafael was passionate about\
  \ justice and the people of Nicaragua. But Rafael was stuck, he needed to support\
  \ his family. He woke up in the early hours of the morning and walked an hour to\
  \ the bus. The bus then took almost two hours to Leon and then he needed to walk\
  \ or take local transport to his job. He then had to work a full day guiding tourists\
  \ around the country he loves and is so passionate about. Our tour ended around\
  \ 9pm, maybe later. He then had to make his way back home. He traveled many hours\
  \ twice a day, every day to support his family. \n\nRafael made a large impact on\
  \ the both of us. We talked about him often in the weeks after returning home. After\
  \ returning home, we adopted a cat that we were fostering. We named him Raffie after\
  \ Rafael. I often think of Rafael and hope his dreams of becoming a journalist came\
  \ true. But I fear he may still be guiding tours, but definitely impacting anyone\
  \ who has the pleasure of interacting with him."
