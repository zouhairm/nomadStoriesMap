Text: "Tranquility\n\nSince i belong to a family where i&apos;ve seen my dad travelling\
  \ now and then due to his journalism profession, i was kind of or probably very\
  \ beguiled by the idea of travelling. \n\nI would preferably find my career in travelling\
  \ rather than being in some ho-hum kind of a corporate job, where you have to complete\
  \ your 9 to 5 shift every freaking day and still strive for promotion. Actually,\
  \ i desire to travel every nook and corner of the world but i still have a long\
  \ way to go, as so i believe in this wise old saying &quot; A dream doesn&apos;t\
  \ become reality through magic, it takes sweat determination and hard work&quot;\
  \ so definitely i&apos;ll have to work towards it completely.\n\n\nI was fortunate\
  \ enough to get a chance to experience the beauty and serenity of one of the most\
  \ beautiful hill stations in India, Manali. It is amidst the mountains with&nbsp;\
  \ captivating views, the enthralling beas river, the abiding redolence of the pines\
  \ and every little thing that could make you feel in heaven. I have this affinity\
  \ for places like this. I was there with my family and some of my closest cousins,\
  \ so the trip just became merrier. \n\nThe evenings in Manali were like none others,\
  \ it was a totally different feeling, a good one though infact the happiest one.\
  \ The streets of manali, the cute little eateries, everything was so good. The most\
  \ ecstatic moment was when i sat on the banks of the beas river, the sound of the\
  \ gushing waters of the river, the fog surrounding the area and the amazing picturesque\
  \ made me feel like i was dreaming, a dream i would never want to wake up from."
