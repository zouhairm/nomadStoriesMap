Text: "Brazil is dominated by its vast cities and even vaster rainforests, but lying\
  \ not too far from Rio de Janeiro sit the two small, lesser-known settlements of\
  \ Paraty and Ilha Grande, and it was here I really fell in love with the country.\n\
  \nAfter spending three days exploring the mesmerising natural beauty of the Iguassu\
  \ waterfall complex, a short flight took us into the chaotic hub of Sao Paolo. Peering\
  \ out of the window as we came into land, there was not an open space in sight;\
  \ coming from the relative calm of the waterways, I could feel my adrenaline building,\
  \ ready for city life.\n\nPersonally, I love big cities, and I\u2019d read and heard\
  \ how intense Sao Paolo could be. At first sight it was quite intimidating - building\
  \ upon building, sleek tower blocks and slums intertwined, and that frenetic energy\
  \ you often feel at major airports felt very strong once we were on the ground;\
  \ a moderate police presence combined with large groups of fast talking Brazilians\
  \ certainly reinforced the sense that Sao Paolo would be a turbulent experience.\
  \ However, no sooner had we landed then we began the 5-hour drive away from the\
  \ city, north-east towards the coast and into the State of Rio de Janeiro and the\
  \ seaside resort of Paraty."
