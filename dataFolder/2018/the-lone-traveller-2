Text: "This experience goes back to 3 years ago, a winter vacation in the beautiful\
  \ lands of Spain. I am an Indian who was studying in France at that time. The winter\
  \ break was nearing so was the urge to travel. With initial umpteen number of mishaps\
  \ and cancellations, finally I decided to spend the 15 day long vacation with two\
  \ people, one whom I barely knew and one whom I hadn\u2019t even met before. It\
  \ might seem normal to a lot of people as everyone is used to solo traveling. But\
  \ being an Indian, I have always been accompanied. Moreover this was within a 3\
  \ months span on which I had moved to France. Emotions were taking a roller coaster\
  \ ride; there was excitement, vulnerability, panic and distress. All of these emotions\
  \ with a new adventure ahead. Surely thrill did triumph. \nThis vagabondage begun\
  \ with the first pit stop at Barcelona. I haven\u2019t visited any city as energetic\
  \ and lively as this one. The vibe is absolutely enthralling! The following days\
  \ we explored Valencia, Costa Brava, Seville, Madrid, Granada, Malaga and Ibiza.\
  \ Each day was filled with Patata Bravas, Tapas and of course Cava. Each city was\
  \ an adventure by itself. Ibiza during the winters is a total opposite of what it\
  \ is during the summers. And being someone who enjoys partying, I fell in love with\
  \ the beauty Ibiza had to offer. Treks to distant secluded beaches and cliffs. Ah!\
  \ brings back beautiful memories.\nGranada was the city that pushed me to doing\
  \ something I never thought I could do or would ever do. It was just another day\
  \ of exploration, but what changed was that the friends I was traveling with disappeared\
  \ the morning I woke up. The best that could come out of this situation was that\
  \ I was dwelling in a hostel. Firstly I was shook by what had happened, and how\
  \ overnight things went out of control. And how I wasn\u2019t even aware of the\
  \ tiff between the two. But I somehow got myself to wake up and seep in what the\
  \ city had to offer. Suggestions from fellow hostelites , embarking the city begun.\
  \ And to this day I can still say that I haven\u2019t seen a more beautiful sunset\
  \ or enjoyed exploring by myself.\nIt was an adventure that changed me. Since then\
  \ traveling alone in the far forgotten lands hasn\u2019t scared me anymore but has\
  \ made me curious and strong. It was something that could have gone in the complete\
  \ opposite direction with me moving back to my comfort zone, but I feel I did accomplish\
  \ responsibility and the individuality. The biggest lesson that I learnt was that\
  \ all we need in this world is our self."
