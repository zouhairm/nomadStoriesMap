Text: "Standing outside a rusty fence in the heart of Coimbra, the air was filled\
  \ with cigarette smoke and exhaust fumes. The cold stings my nose. I was filled\
  \ with anxiety as I stumbled through the gate and into the home my father\u2019\
  s parents for the very first time. \n\nIt was never a secret that my father disagreed\
  \ with his family, it was the reason he moved across hemispheres. For me, every\
  \ school Grandparent\u2019s Day was spent watching friends bond with their grandparents\
  \ while I stood alongside the teacher. 20 years later, I was finally getting my\
  \ own Grandparents Day. Equal parts unnerving and exciting the evident language\
  \ barrier seemed like a slight hiccup in my well thought out plan. I was going to\
  \ meet my grandparents and figure out \u201Cwho I was\u201D like the entitled millennial\
  \ everyone assumed me to be. \n\nMy grandfather slowly and ineptly rose from his\
  \ chair in the garden, no longer the agile man of his youth. He softly opened his\
  \ arms as I approached. The anxiety continued to build as I tentatively hugged the\
  \ man I had never met or spoken with. The awkwardness usually experienced when hugging\
  \ a stranger disappeared and a wave a warmth came over me. The feeling was something\
  \ you wouldn\u2019t find in the contents of a Hallmark card. It felt like home.\
  \ He released me then, carefully shuffling around the corner and into the house,\
  \ lead me to the kitchen table where my grandmother was sitting. \n\nThe size of\
  \ twelve year old child, no doubt weighing the same, my grandmother had a stern,\
  \ tired face. Where my grandfather was softness, my grandmother was the opposite.\
  \ So tough it seemed like she ate glass for breakfast. It was the perfect combination,\
  \ the perfect balance and clearly the work of 60 dedicated years of marriage. They\
  \ moved seamlessly around the cramped kitchen. There was something serene about\
  \ the simplicity of their relationship. Such a contrast to the 21st century I lived\
  \ in, drowning in technology and constant social inadequacy. No words, no text messages,\
  \ no instagram - just love and comfort. \n\nNow fragile, retired farmers, my grandparents\
  \ never attended school but somehow were the most educated people I\u2019d ever\
  \ meet. They were educated in life. They didn\u2019t speak English, I didn\u2019\
  t speak Portuguese, yet somehow this was the most meaningful conversation I\u2019\
  d ever had. Looking into the gentle eyes of the people responsible for my large\
  \ lips, menacing eyebrows and firey temper was soul stirring.  It was at this moment\
  \ I began to understand who I was."
