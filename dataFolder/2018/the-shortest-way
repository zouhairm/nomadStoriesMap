Text: "It was a dark and stormy night...not exactly. Actually it was a sunny, hot\
  \ morning. But that day the bus was crowded of voices and people. It\u2019s so hot\
  \ in here, I feel dizzy, why everything is getting dark?I don\u2019t remember much\
  \ of that day, except  that I woke up in an hospital. The doc. told me: \u201CIt\u2019\
  s a neuronal dysfunction. You gotta take some medicines, rest, quit sport; step\
  \ by step you get used to it\u201D. \nFrom that day nothing has been the same. The\
  \ strong woman I used to live inside was moving somewhere else. She became a small\
  \ silhouette that I could not recognize. The more she moved away, the more was growing\
  \ a new woman, fragile, scared, unable to control her body or leave home without\
  \ vertigo and panic attacks.\nI needed to travel. I\u2019ve been travelling for\
  \ a lifetime: the journey makes me feel strong, sure, free; it makes me meet unexplored\
  \ worlds outside and inside of me. Brazil, a big country full of contrasts and spontaneity.\
  \ I book the flight, I buy the guide, the rest will come. A little inner voice tells\
  \ me that I'm nut: I'm alone, sick and I'm going to get lost in a 200millions inhabitants\
  \ country. A coin has chosen for me the night before leaving. Heads I stay, tails\
  \ I go. TAILS!. It's easier when a piece of copper chooses for you.\nRio\u2019s\
  \ amazing. People are always ready to help the trembling lady with vertigo .They\
  \ have a powerful drug against panic attacks. It\u2019s called caipirinha.\nI move\
  \ to Iguazu falls. They remind me that water finds obstacles, but it always manages\
  \ to overcome them and it keeps flowing. My journey continues: miles, flights, faces,\
  \ buses. Recife, Pipa, Natal, and down to the last stop: Salvador with its decadent\
  \ charm that reminds me so much of my hometown. \nOne day a french guy tells me\
  \ \"You can not leave without doing the Tiroleza: a jump into the sea from a 70mt\
  \ high mountain\u201D. It's the last thing I would do in my life, but I'm curious.\
  \ I venture into a trek and I find a road sign: way to Tiroleza-2hours and \xBD\
  .\nI say to myself: \"I get to the top just to glance and get back down\". I arrive\
  \ on top and I\u2019m destroyed.\nOn the top there is a thin guy who wields ropes.\
  \ He asks me the weight.\n\"Oh no! I'm not here to jump\".\n\u201CWhy not?\".\n\u201C\
  No way!I suffer from vertigo and I'm tired, please show me the shortest way to get\
  \ down\".\nHe doesn't speak, just indicates the pulley on the edge and says: \u201C\
  that's the shortest way\u201D.\n20 seconds after I was there, hanging over the ocean\
  \ with my vertigo left behind, all alone, waiting for me on the edge."
