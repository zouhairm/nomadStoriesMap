Text: "I urged the little grey pony into a canter. Left hand gripping my Mongolian\
  \ bow, right hand on the reins, ready. My hand flew back to my quiver. Arrow. Nock.\
  \ Draw. Loose. Hit. The next target came up quickly. Arrow. Nock. Draw. Loose. The\
  \ pony had tripped\u2026 Miss. I cursed as I had lost my chance at a medal. Here\
  \ came the final target. Hit.\n\nIt was the first ever International Horseback Archery\
  \ Competition between China, Hong Kong and Korea, set in Qinghai, greater Tibet.\
  \ I was new to the sport and had barely made it onto the Hong Kong team. Surrounded\
  \ by pros and masters of martial arts, I felt sorely out of my depth. One competitor,\
  \ Master Kim, could floor a man twice his size using just his thumb!\n\nWhen we\
  \ first arrived, we spent two days on a whirlwind tour of Qinghai. After receiving\
  \ blessings from the Living Buddha, we walked around the Ta\u2019er Monastery. We\
  \ were intrigued by the Yellow Hat Sect monks and the intricate murals. At Qinghai\
  \ Lake, we got caught in a freezing downpour, and warmed ourselves up with cat stew.\
  \ Finally, we arrived at our competition ground. It was a stretch of dusty road,\
  \ surrounded by lush grassy hills, devoid of people.\n\nThe competition began and\
  \ the idyllic pastoral scene became a pandemonium of life and colour. Folk music,\
  \ flags, and drumming filled the air. Thousands of people materialised, covering\
  \ the hills. All of them were there to support their local competitors, eager to\
  \ watch three days of mounted and foot archery. One local girl took a particular\
  \ shine to me and became my guide, staying by my side for the entire competition.\n\
  \nNow it was time for the foot archery. I squinted up at the target. It was 50 metres\
  \ away and halfway up a hill, a hard shot. I stood there, waiting for my opponent\
  \ to turn up. Suddenly someone was pushed through the crowd towards me. He spun\
  \ back, furious and started a heated argument with two men. My guide leaned over\
  \ to explain that no man wanted to compete against me because I was a girl. If he\
  \ lost, he would be ridiculed by the village.\n\nI was stunned. As the youngest,\
  \ smallest and most inexperienced of the team, I had spent the week in awe of my\
  \ competitors. To find out the opposition was terrified of me, was invigorating.\
  \ I met the gaze of my guide, and smiled as a steely determination set in. I would\
  \ show them what a girl could do.\n\nEventually they reached a decision. The original\
  \ man grabbed a bow and marched towards me, glowering. This was it. Deep breath.\
  \ Arrow. Nock. Draw. Loose\u2026"
