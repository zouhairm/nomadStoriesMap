Text: "There are many things you should be doing at 10pm in the evening; drinking\
  \ with friends, having supper, sleeping\u2026climbing a volcano should not be one.\n\
  \ As our rickety old mini bus pulled up into the lay by, an unexpected cold breeze\
  \ hit my skin as I stepped out, the first and only time I was to experience this\
  \ in Indonesia. We followed our guides hand as he pointed up towards the towering\
  \ peak of Merapi, an active volcano feared by the locals and marvelled at by travellers.\
  \ Translating literally into \u2018mountain of fire\u2019 Merapi is one of the few\
  \ volcanoes in the world where you can see the bright red lava lake inside.\n We\
  \ set off traversing the dark and dingy paths, stumbling on the small rocks and\
  \ crashing into huge boulders. My head beginning to pound from a mixture of the\
  \ cold and altitude sickness. 8,000 feet up and counting was no place to be as the\
  \ clock stuck midnight.\n The aim was to be at the top by sunrise, a cruel trick\
  \ played on travellers to stop us being lazy \u2013 or so I thought.\n We left behind\
  \ the muddy tree lined slopes and hit the crumbling skree, edging nervously towards\
  \ the top, the fiery heat bursting out of pot holed vents along the way. Boulders\
  \ dislodged by travellers up ahead cascaded down the steep dark slopes, whistling\
  \ past our ears with the shout \u2018Rock!\u2019 only coming after a brush with\
  \ death.\n As we finally made it to the plateaux and headed towards the crater,\
  \ sunlight was beginning to peak through the sheet of cloud in the distance as if\
  \ the horizon was on fire with a warming glow. \nTentatively working our way upwards\
  \ to see the reward, I scrambled to the edge, hit the peak and looked over.\nBefore\
  \ me was a sea of rock, not molten, not red like the depths of the sun, just rock.\
  \ Annoyed and frustrated I turned around to proclaim my disappointment and as I\
  \ did there it was, the sight that took my breath away. The sun, rising triumphantly\
  \ against the dark night, but more spectacularly then I could have ever imagined.\
  \ The clouds parting before me, as if Moses himself had struck down his staff and\
  \ proclaimed to God, revealing the rainbow of reds I was looking for. \nWe rested\
  \ whilst enjoying the show from one of nature\u2019s greatest events, one that amazingly\
  \ happens everyday. All that was left to do was descend.\nThere are many things\
  \ you could be doing at 8am in the morning, having breakfast, heading to work, sleeping\u2026\
  the last thing I expected was to find climbing down a volcano after a glorious sunrise\
  \ should be one."
