Text: "\u201C\xA1Yanapaway!\u201D he screamed. \u201C\xA1Yanapaway! \xA1Asnu!\u201D\
  \ These desperate pleas began the story of The Great Donkey Rescue of Peru.\n It\
  \ was a cold winter evening in a valley of the Cordillera Blancas Mountain Range.\
  \ We had just set up camp and decided to explore our surroundings. With snow-covered\
  \ peaks above us and beautiful pastures around us, we meandered through meadows,\
  \ hopped over rippling streams, and admired the wild horses in sheer tranquility.\
  \ Suddenly, out of nowhere, a sweat-soaked boy came barreling towards us.\n He begged\
  \ us in a dialect we did not understand, and tugged on our clothes until we reluctantly,\
  \ but hastily ran with him over a hill to a field below where four more boys were\
  \ flailing frantically, moving as if seizures had overtaken them. As we approached\
  \ the commotion an odd scene came into view. A young donkey, asnu in Quechua, was\
  \ shoulder deep in thick mud, distraught and hee-hawing loudly. Fear plagued its\
  \ face, and the faces of the five boys who were undoubtedly going to get in trouble\
  \ for this quagmire.\nWithout wavering we jumped in to assist, but soon realized\
  \ that we needed more experienced help. After assuring the boys we would return,\
  \ we raced back to camp to get our local guide. He looked shocked as we approached\
  \ disheveled, muddy, and completely out of breath. But without missing a beat he\
  \ sped off with us over the hill.\nWhile shouting commands at the children, he wrapped\
  \ a rope around the donkey\u2019s neck, and began gently pulling while petting its\
  \ face.  As its front legs began to surface he threw us a rope, telling us to wrap\
  \ it around them and pull up. I had never wrapped a rope around a donkey\u2019s\
  \ legs, and had no idea how to even start that process, but somehow a few seconds\
  \ later, it was done.\nAs the donkey continued to emerge, our guide urgently shouted\
  \ at us in Quechua. Instantly two of the boys shoved us aside and hastily loosened\
  \ the rope around the donkey\u2019s legs just as its hooves were able to touch solid\
  \ ground. \nThe donkey thrashed so powerfully that it swung his hind legs out of\
  \ the mud and began bouncing wildly all over the place. We all backed away to give\
  \ the newly freed, hysterically happy donkey all the space he needed. Sitting stunned\
  \ on the damp ground, elation began filling us from the inside out as we considered\
  \ the reality of what had just happened. Our guide turned to us, let out a sigh,\
  \ and helped us up. He draped his arms over our shoulders and we walked back to\
  \ camp in contemplative but joyous silence."
