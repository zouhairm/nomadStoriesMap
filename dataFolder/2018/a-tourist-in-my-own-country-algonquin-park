Text: "Standing at the top of the cliff, looking out over the lakes and forests I\
  \ felt like a could conquer anything. I wondered why it took so long for me to come\
  \ out, climb up, and enjoy it. \n\nI've never been seen as an outdoorsy girl. I\
  \ hate sitting outside, I don\u2019t like bugs, but I love nature when I can really\
  \ enjoy it.  \n\nAlgonquin Park is one of the most beautiful places that I\u2019\
  ve ever been to. While it\u2019s in Ontario, where I live, it is a few hours away\
  \ so I had never made the choice to go out and see what really was there to enjoy.\
  \ When my relatives from Belgium came to visit and we planned a trip to Algonquin\
  \ I realized what I was missing.\n\nHiking at Algonquin was beautiful. While the\
  \ trails were a workout leading to a few minor injuries, and the bugs were brutal,\
  \ it was completely worth while. The nature, the views, we\u2019re all so breathtaking\
  \ I felt like I could have stayed there forever. \n\nI was astounded that something\
  \ so unique and amazing had been at my fingertips my entire life. When I thought\
  \ about the wonders of nature I had forgotten about exploring my own backyard. It's\
  \ easy to overlook what has already been handed to you. \n\nThis was my first experience\
  \ hiking. I had no idea what hikers really go through when they are completing their\
  \ climb. Although Algonquin has easier trails, the tougher ones are worth it if\
  \ you really want an amazing view. More important yet are the people that you take\
  \ up the mountain. Hiking with my sister and my family made each moment worth more\
  \ as they were filled with laughs and joy. \n\nI can still picture how it looks\
  \ from the top, like nature is all that there is, no cities, no pollution, no problems.\
  \ If you take the time to really look at or enjoy something that you had been avoiding,\
  \ it can be such an amazing and rewarding experience. In fact it was one of the\
  \ best days I think i\u2019ve had. Not to mention I have some beautiful photos to\
  \ remember it by.\n\nGet out and enjoy the world around you, even if you don\u2019\
  t think it will be exciting. It can surprise you, and you can make some amazing\
  \ memories."
