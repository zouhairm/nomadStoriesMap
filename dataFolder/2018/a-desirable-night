Text: "That wasn\u2019t a day of \u201Chigh expectations\u201D because it was quite\
  \ spoiled by impressions of the previous one. Our host, that weird guy, took me\
  \ and my friend to a pub for a meeting. I was drinking my first glass of wine yet,\
  \ surrounded by completely strangers, in order to overcome my anxiety. At that exact\
  \ minuet he came in. He was huge, with a charming smile. He shook hands with everyone\
  \ and sat in front of me, saying \u201Chi, I\u2019m Rodrigo, but you can call me\
  \ Rod\u201D. To him I was exotic as well as he was to me. He sang a song in my native\
  \ language with his tender accent, fully amazed me. Rodrigo told he came here to\
  \ see his brother, who was as charming as Rodrigo, Augustin, and who was at the\
  \ pub, too.  He conquered my friend\u2019s heart, while Rodrigo was singing songs\
  \ to me in Russian. Although he wasn\u2019t local, I felt like I\u2019m home. The\
  \ world was my home. We chitchatted about this and that, smoked and laughed, while\
  \ the magic of this evening was sneaking into our hearts. I was having a time of\
  \ my life and didn\u2019t want it to end. So I asked them to join us later knowing\
  \ they definitely would. Entwined with the night, we roamed seeking for adventures.\
  \ There were 6 of us when we left the pub moving to another. All from different\
  \ places, speaking different language we had no limits or barriers then. Eventually\
  \ we split up, made a deal with our host we\u2019ll come back to him and stayed\
  \ with the brothers. I turned off my brain and was living a moment, it was instantaneous\
  \ indeed, when the time was up. We looked at each other like we were acquainted\
  \ for a long time. We could keep silent and it wouldn\u2019t be awkward. We spoke\
  \ with instincts. A sensual look, a passionate kiss, sharing each other\u2019s numbers.\
  \ I was confident I will see him again. But that was just one fleeting blink of\
  \ an eye, one moment that was perfectly right.  We said goodbyes with words and\
  \ I guess for good. I never saw him again and never had a chance to use his number.\
  \ I\u2019d reached out, but no one would be there. Maybe I regret it didn\u2019\
  t last forever, but that blast of life will remain a part of me. The night was desirable\
  \ and everything reminded: It\u2019s a good thing, to be alive."
