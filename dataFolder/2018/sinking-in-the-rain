Text: "As I said many times, when we come back home, we'll speak Maori better than\
  \ English. \nThe proof of the pudding is next to me. It\u2019s in my boyfriend Rocco\
  \ giving thanks to Mother Nature in maori taken by surprise while driving back from\
  \ Milford Sound to Te Anau. \nHe's shouting \"Kia Ora, Papat\u016B\u0101nuku!\"\
  \ from the rooftops (Thanks to Mother Nature). I taught him that and this is the\
  \ first time he pronounces it correctly. I look at him and I smile. His joy is deep,\
  \ penetrating.\nThere\u2019s no car coming on the road. We\u2019re alone, floating.\n\
  It rains cats and dogs, British people say. I say: \u201CIt rains Noah\u2019s ark\
  \ here!\u201D.    \nThere are rainfalls everywhere. I can hardly believe my clouded\
  \ eyes. It looks like the sky is falling down over our heads. \nWe turn off the\
  \ radio to listen to the sound of water. I am dazed, scared, overwhelmed, but happy\
  \ at the same time.\nIn this remote spot I can feel the power of Nature. Sometimes\
  \ we forget it, \u2018cause we\u2019re too busy dealing in little trifling things.\
  \ \nI hold in my hands the pounamu (greenstone) necklace which a maori woman gave\
  \ me blessing me before leaving Waitangi some months ago. Jade emits a sort of energy,\
  \ I don\u2019t know why. I whisper: \u201CThanks for all this water flowing from\
  \ the sky and sinking into the Earth. It reminds us of the life cycle: we are as\
  \ fleeting as the clouds where we come from and the ground is ready to host our\
  \ tired bodies\u201D. In the meanwhile, the rain abates a bit. \nMy boyfriend stops\
  \ the car. He\u2019s pointing out three rainbows on the left. We park for a while,\
  \ kiss under a pierced lilac poncho, have a glass of Pinot gris toasting in honour\
  \ of  Papat\u016B\u0101nuku.\nThen we get back in the car looking like drowned rats.I\
  \ strip down to my shorts and put on my coat while I drives in his underwear turning\
  \ up the heat. \nThe radio turns on again by itself magically. It starts raining\
  \ again.The song playing in the background is \u201CA hard rain is a-gonna fall\u201D\
  \ by Bob Dylan. We start laughing and singing like a couple of kids. \n\"Kia Ora,\
  \ Papat\u016B\u0101nuku!\", I think. \u201CI like Bob Dylan too! Good choice!\u201D\
  .\nWe\u2019re singing in the rain, sinking in the rain."
