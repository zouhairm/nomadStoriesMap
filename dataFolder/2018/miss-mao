Text: "I stared at the glossy red statue before me. Its beady eyes stared back, between\
  \ them a crimson nose that stretched out like Pinocchio\u2019s. The statue\u2019\
  s voluptuous body and features were unmistakably female, yet its face - and I knew\
  \ that face - was unmistakably Mao Zedong.\n\u201CHe killed my father.\u201D \n\
  The voice belonged to Gao Zhen, the artist of the piece whom I had met hours earlier.\
  \ It was a blazing Saturday in July with unnaturally clear skies for Beijing. I\
  \ had been  studying Mandarin in the capital city for a month, and decided to take\
  \ the opportunity to explore the 798 Arts District. Once-abandoned factories line\
  \ the streets of this zone, the arched ceilings, like sawtooths, reflecting the\
  \ Bauhaus-influenced style of the East Germans who helped build them soon after\
  \ the formation of the People\u2019s Republic of China. Since Robert Bernell, an\
  \ American, brought his Timezone 8 Art Books shop to the area in 2001, artists and\
  \ designers have moved in steadily, enticed by the availability of vast open spaces.\
  \ \nIt was next to one of these revamped buildings, in the trendy Cafe Flatwhite,\
  \ that I encountered Gao Zhen. He was a slight and bald man of 60 years, with thick-rimmed\
  \ glasses that matched his all-black outfit. I must have impressed him with my Mandarin\
  \ in our brief conversation - after a few minutes, he invited me to his home studio.\
  \ \nImmediately after walking in, I was greeted by a statue of Christ, only this\
  \ particular one had seven men standing around him with rifles aimed square at his\
  \ chest. Among them? Mao Zedong himself. The motif of modern China\u2019s first\
  \ and most important leader is found across Gao Zhen\u2019s art, from the \u201C\
  Miss Mao\u201D statues depicting him as an obese woman, to the photograph gazing\
  \ up at Mao\u2019s portrait in Tiananmen Square, representing the way that his presence\
  \ is still felt over the nation. Gao Zhen together with his younger brother Gao\
  \ Qiang form the Gao Brothers, internationally-acclaimed avante-garde artists who\
  \ repeatedly test the limits of expression in China. \nIt\u2019s not common for\
  \ the duo to invite outsiders due to the content of their art. Chinese authorities\
  \ have often raided the home, removing items the state deems \u201Coffensive.\u201D\
  \ Gao Zhen isn\u2019t fazed, though. \n\u201CMy father was imprisoned during the\
  \ Cultural Revolution. They told us he committed suicide. But we know that is not\
  \ the truth.\u201D For now, they continue to host secret showings. And as time passes\
  \ and the past grows murkier, critiques of Mao continue to become more widespread."
