Text: "Don\u2019t get too close to the edge. Everyone would tell me. Growing up, I\
  \ was fed this feared warning. They were so afraid of being at the edge or even\
  \ near it. As I got older, I realized, it\u2019s actually liberating being close\
  \ to the edge. The only way to go from there is down, or back to the original route\
  \ you took to get there in the first place. But, who wants to repeat the same journey\
  \ twice, am I right? So, boring. You\u2019ve pretty much already seen everything\
  \ on the way. True? And now you\u2019re at the edge. Figuring out what to do next.\
  \ You wait, you wonder, you watch. Should I go left? Maybe right? No wait, that\u2019\
  s stupid. It\u2019s all going to lead back to the same road. I step a little closer.\
  \ My foot scrapes on the cliff\u2019s border. Rocks fall. No sound of them hitting\
  \ anything on the way down. Where did they go? Was something down there to catch\
  \ them? I think to myself. Just some rocks. Lifeless, stone-cold rocks. With every\
  \ pun intended.\n\nI walk along the entire perimeter close to where land stops.\
  \ I can\u2019t go further. For there is nothing more in the straight beyond. My\
  \ feet can no longer plant one foot in front of the other, and be supported by solid\
  \ ground. I look up. I look left, then right. Shoulders hunched forwards, I kneel.\
  \ I take in a deep breath, and now I look down. I see everything, and yet I see\
  \ nothing. Patterns, and shapes. Clusters of green. Rapids winking up at me as the\
  \ sun strokes his slippery beard. Whoever says that being too close to the edge\
  \ is dangerous, are so terribly wrong, and clearly missing out on the fullness of\
  \ life.\n\nIt\u2019s thrilling, sneaking a peak for what\u2019s over the edge but\
  \ not really knowing. I see an opportunity. A blazing trail, where other footprints\
  \ have trodden before. It\u2019s so subtle, but they\u2019re there. An indication\
  \ of human contact. I know where I need to go. I pick up pace. Faster. Faster still.\
  \ I am running now. Leaves rustling, trees wave in my direction. I slip, I fall.\
  \ Grazed knees. I hit my head. But I get straight back up again. The breeze is cool,\
  \ carrying with it the scents of earth and sky. A bird smacks into my face. So much\
  \ beauty to inhale. So much ugliness to exhale. I\u2019m choking on a swarm of flies.\
  \ Nature is magnificent. Truly.\n\nFinally, hours later, I arrive at no particular\
  \ destination. Scratched and bruised. But I look up. And I know that I made the\
  \ right decision. The perspective from the edge could not define what I see before\
  \ me now. I am alive. And I miss nothing.\n\nIt\u2019s time for another adventure."
