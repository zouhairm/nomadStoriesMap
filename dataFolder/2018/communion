Text: "The last thing I expected was 200 bottlenose dolphin \u2013 I mean, swimming\
  \ with dolphins has to be the number one once-in-a-lifetime-can\u2019t-be-engineered-bucket-list\
  \ thing, right?  Maybe it\u2019s a close second to seeing the Northern Lights, just\
  \ less predictable.  But hey, that\u2019s Galapagos for you \u2013 dream-fulfilling.\
  \  A smorgasbord of animals \u2013 animal soup \u2013 an entre of aquatic lizards\
  \ with a side of scales, feathers, and sandpaper skin with fins.\n \nThere\u2019\
  s a profound beauty in being appraised by a wild animal; I am transfixed in amazement\
  \ at such a close encounter, although the sensible bit of my brain (left or right?\
  \  I don\u2019t remember\u2026) tells my body to try and maintain a degree of space\
  \ between us.  I\u2019m swimming with a juvenile sea lion now \u2013 I say swimming\
  \ \u2013 I\u2019m bobbing around on the surface and it\u2019s moving like sentient\
  \ mercury in water.  It eyeballs me with curiosity for a while and then spots my\
  \ GoPro and really starts to show off\u2026it seems the social media effect hasn\u2019\
  t bypassed the sea lion world; it plays up to the camera enough to guarantee the\
  \ first video footage I post.  It takes a lot to knock 200 dolphins off the top\
  \ spot, I\u2019ll tell you. \n \nAnd then suddenly, here I am out of the water on\
  \ God\u2019s arid platter, where both land and air is hot and dry.  Why is there\
  \ nothing here now except sandal destroying volcanic rock?  I can barely walk on\
  \ the black, piercing surface.  Therein lies another wonder of the Galapagos; the\
  \ juxtaposition between the most alive moments and the most vacant landscape, but\
  \ for the blue sea and sky which pervades both.\n \nIf like me, your childlike imagination\
  \ continued with you into adulthood and you create a metal narrative appropriate\
  \ to the unusual landscapes you\u2019re in, as if it\u2019s the backdrop to a film\
  \ (just me?) then Galapagos is definitely The Land Before Time.  Three-year-old\
  \ Dawn scrambles further across the hot rock to the abundance of shoreline, discovering\
  \ prehistoric ocean dwellers under overhangs and scattering the crabs at each step.\
  \  I happen suddenly upon a fur-seal whose Littlefoot eyes tell me it\u2019s there\
  \ to seek peace.  I don\u2019t signal it to the group, and leave in the knowledge\
  \ that we understood each other.\n \nThat\u2019s the thing with Galapagos \u2013\
  \ you\u2019ll connect with wildlife in a way you never thought possible.  Perhaps\
  \ it\u2019s the closest we can come to touching the void between man and beast \u2013\
  \ who\u2019s observing whom here?  I don\u2019t know.  I yearn for the sacred protection\
  \ it deserves so that others might find out."
