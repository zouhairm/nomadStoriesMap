Text: "Vast expanse of barren land with an enigmatic sense of emptiness, thats what\
  \ sums up the landscape on offer as you drive across LEH, a town in its namesake\
  \ district located in the Indian state of Jammu & Kashmir. For a city dweller like\
  \ me, who is used to concrete skyscrapers & overcrowded places, I was definitely\
  \ awestruck after reaching the valley nestled among snow clad Himalayan peaks. The\
  \ place has an innate capability to instantly teleport you to an ethereal world.\
  \ With every passing day it grows upon you, all thanks to the absolute lack of any\
  \ flora & fauna including human settlement. But that made me a little sad since\
  \ I thought my insatiable craving for human connect (Yes, I am that guy who goes\
  \ to cafe just to watch people) will remain unfulfilled during the trip. But God\
  \ had other plans.\nOne day while returning from visiting a monastery, we came across\
  \ a celebratory social gathering, a marriage. Being uninvited and not being local,\
  \ we all were a little apprehensive in the beginning, but the quirky me made the\
  \ first move and requested the hosts to allow us to be a part of the celebrations.\
  \ They were exceptionally kind and as the chilling wind picked up pace we found\
  \ ourselves settled inside a colourful tent full of charming people. We were welcomed\
  \ by a local drink, brewed in open field just next to the portable marriage hall.\
  \ That bad boy surely packed some punch. It knocked off couple of layers of protective\
  \ gear we had on and got all of us talking, perfect ice-breaker!\nWe realised that\
  \ this was far from the usual elaborate, weeklong big fat Indian wedding. It\u2019\
  s a simple oneday event with close knit people much like the westerners. The gifts\
  \ exchanged were essentials like butter, sugar, rice, contrary to the traditional\
  \ Indian custom of giving flashy, useless stuff. We all sat on ground and were served\
  \ with sweets, biscuits, dry fruits. Initially, people were a little shy but soon\
  \ the conversations became more frequent. Their stories about constant fight with\
  \ mother nature for basic needs of life unknowingly taught us serious life lessons\
  \ and made us appreciate all those luxuries of life which we take for granted.\n\
  Amidst the heavenly surroundings with setting sun at their backdrop, the bride &\
  \ groom exchanged vows and we remained witness to the most spectacular wedding ceremony\
  \ of our lives. The deep connection which I felt that day with those locals as we\
  \ all danced away to darkness still lingers on my mind as the happiest memory of\
  \ that trip."
