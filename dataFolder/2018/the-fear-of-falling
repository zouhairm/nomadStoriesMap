Text: "Nicolas and Tomas tell me it\u2019s safe. They say it doesn\u2019t matter if\
  \ I\u2019ve never ridden a horse before. They say their steeds are gentle.\n\nWe\u2019\
  re on horseback on our way to San Juan Chamula, a town three miles from our starting\
  \ point in San Cristobal de las Casas. Ten-year-old Nicolas, and twelve-year-old\
  \ Tomas are my guides for the day\u200A\u2014\u200Ashy boys barely tall enough to\
  \ mount the speckled geldings they ride.\n\nI\u2019m petrified as my four-legged\
  \ companion, Pajarito, a chocolate-colored horse who is a bit underfed and in need\
  \ of a good brushing, jerks through the wet boulders and steep slopes of the unmarked\
  \ path we follow. \n\nDeciding to ride today was a way to prove to myself that I\
  \ could do things on my own. For the past year, I\u2019ve struggled to be more independent\
  \ and break my reliance on others\u2014afraid to fall if I\u2019m left alone. Mounted\
  \ here on top of Pajarito, I can\u2019t help but draw a parallel to my own real\
  \ fear, and I wish there was someone here to take the reins instead of me.\n\nDespite\
  \ my anxiety, I follow Nicolas and Tomas as they take me through a trail of shifting\
  \ landscapes: forests with naked trees that cradle the sky, perfectly squared acres\
  \ of green and yellow farmlands that extend and ripple like waves. It\u2019s a world\
  \ so far removed from what I\u2019m used to, in a country that runs through my blood\
  \ but isn\u2019t quite mine. I try to enjoy it, but Pajarito\u2019s trot is quickening.\n\
  \nUp ahead, the boys seem to have forgotten I\u2019m there. Trotting faster and\
  \ faster, they put a significant gap between us. Pajarito, sensing we\u2019re being\
  \ left behind, begins to gallop furiously and I, not knowing how to stop him, begin\
  \ to scream. \n\nI let go of the reins and grasp his saddle desperately, thinking\
  \ of nothing but the fear that has settled inside my entire body and is now pouring\
  \ out of me in a loud, deep, unintelligible yell of terror. Everything around me\
  \ is a chaotic blur of color. I hear no sound except for the clattering of hooves.\n\
  \nI close my eyes and fall, no longer feeling Pajarito\u2019s warm body, only the\
  \ gravity pulling me quickly onto the rough grass below me. When I open my eyes,\
  \ I\u2019m lying face down in the middle of a clearing. My nose and right arm sting\
  \ in pain. \n\nI lie still, feeling the adrenaline still pounding in my chest. What\
  \ I\u2019ve been scared of all day has finally happened, though now with the initial\
  \ shock settling, I realize that perhaps, like life, the fear of falling is much\
  \ worse than the fall itself. I\u2019m scratched and bruised, but feel far stronger\
  \ to face what scares me."
