Text: "The air smelled both clean and of dust, occasionally gusting past with the\
  \ scent of scrub and dead grass. The northern Arizona sky blazed nearly white with\
  \ heat. The only sounds were the noxious thrum of insects whirring past, the grasping\
  \ sounds of my father and brother climbing on the other side of the rock, my own\
  \ excited breathing. \n\nThe rock was creamy white and speckled with lichen. We\
  \ were examining pink fossils of tubeworms and ammonites; delicate, spiked legs\
  \ of ancient crabs were embedded here and there. I wanted to find a prize, a badge\
  \ of scientific honor to carry home from the desolate Arizona Strip, proof of the\
  \ amazing contrasts of geologic time. A collector\u2019s greed pushed me further\
  \ and further out along the ridge.\n\nBefore scurrying off on my own, I had paused\
  \ near my father. He told me how God had brought forth the seas and the rock, and\
  \ also something about space, and as usual I internally sighed and dismissed his\
  \ religious cosmogony and felt a little embarrassed at how simple he seemed. I already\
  \ knew better about the formation of the continents and the natural origin of things.\
  \ \n\nLeaving him, I worked my way over the edge, thinking perhaps I could find\
  \ something to pry away in the cracks between the formations. Clinging to the top\
  \ and stepping down, I was startled by an insistent buzzing to my right.\n\nI couldn\u2019\
  t move; all color and heat had left the world. A rattlesnake was in the shade of\
  \ the ledge, less than a foot from my side.\n\nSome part of me recognized that the\
  \ sound was more of a buzz than a rattle because it was young. I had heard that\
  \ baby rattlesnakes can be more dangerous than adults, because while carrying the\
  \ same venom, they are more likely to feel threatened and strike.\n \nI stared at\
  \ its head, saw its eyes fixed on me; the tongue flickered. The buzzing never ceased.\
  \ I don\u2019t know how long we contemplated each other.\n\nEventually the snake\
  \ began to edge further back under the rock, its upper portion heading to the left,\
  \ head still focused on me, while the lower half unrolled to the right. Running\
  \ diamond patterns backed into shadow. \n\nWhen I was able to move again I stumbled\
  \ down the hill to the truck. I was trembling so badly it was difficult to run.\
  \ The nearest town was over an hour away over terrible roads. I had been singled\
  \ out on that rock; I had been lucky, but I had also been considered; I had been\
  \ spared. I knew that those feelings were of a religious quality as well."
