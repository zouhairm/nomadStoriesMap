Text: "As I stood there, in the middle of the street, being the only one who wasn't\
  \ carrying a stick or holding a rock, and with my backpack hanging from my shoulders,\
  \ I had to pretend that everyone else's eyes looking at me weren't intimidating\
  \ at all.\n\nWhile making my way through the angry faces of the teachers fighting\
  \ for better conditions for them and their families, I could only think of that\
  \ damned failed course that had brought me all the way to this moment:\nI remembered\
  \ my professor giving me the news, and my friends convincing me it was a good idea\
  \ not to tell my parents and retake the course in another state, more than 800 kms\
  \ away from home.\n\nAfter what it felt like an eternity later, with the sun relentlessly\
  \ burning my skin, I finally arrived to where I thought was my best chance of getting\
  \ to safety; I was wrong.\nIn front of me, with their guns, helmets and shields,\
  \ the barrier of policemen looked impenetrable and angry. \nI, standing right in\
  \ front of them, had never felt so vulnerable in my life before, though not afraid.\
  \ There seemed to be hundreds of them, all in blue and ready to attack.\n\nThe civilians,\
  \ who were standing a couple meters away, and formed a more colorful barrier, held\
  \ their ground and stared right back into their faces... not letting up.\nEveryone\
  \ was ready for anything, except me, still with my backpack hanging heavy from my\
  \ shoulders, and the mid-day sweat flowing down my neck.\n\n\"It\u2019s my last\
  \ day\", I thought.\nAnd ironically, it was the last day of classes and thus the\
  \ last day I was supposed to be at Tuxtla (an hour away from my friends and the\
  \ safeness of San Crist\xF3bal de las Casas).\n\nIt had been exactly a month since\
  \ we had arrived in Chiapas, but only a week since I was stuck in Tuxtla, due to\
  \ the manifestations \n\nThrough my mind crossed every daily trip, back and forth\
  \ between cities to study for a couple hours at Tuxtla while living at San Crist\xF3\
  bal. I also remembered how last night I had been forced to silently break into the\
  \ room I had rented the couple nights before that, but couldn\u2019t afford anymore:\
  \ the sneaking in the middle of the night, the not knowing if by the time I opened\
  \ the door there would be a new guest, and the fear of not leaving before the owner\
  \ arrived in the morning\u2026\n\nBack to myself, I was still standing there, like\
  \ the tip of the arrow, like ready to attack as well, with everyone behind me. The\
  \ cops, looking as menacing as no one has ever been before\u2026 and against all\
  \ my instincts, I stepped forward."
