Text: "Today is Sunday. And, in the tropical island of Moorea, Tahiti\u2019s little\
  \ sister, everyone goes to church. \nLike a good Christian,  me too I arrive to\
  \ St Joseph\u2019s, a small white church with a red roof, just on time: time for\
  \ a delicious after service Tahitian lunch.\nAs luck would have it, I\u2019m seated\
  \ next to a big mama. \nA true food connoisseur, I say to myself smiling with gratitude.\
  \ \nShe gives me a strong hug that nearly cracks my ribs, then equally gracefully\
  \ she takes my plate and dumps a little bit of everything on it: boiled taro, firifiri\
  \ or Tahitian doughnut with coconut milk, po\u2019e, a sticky banana pudding, poisson\
  \ cru, the famous raw fish marinated in lemon juice dish. \nWhat surprises me is\
  \ that there is no particular order in which the dishes are served. After all, why\
  \ bother if they all end up in the same place? \nMore, more, I keep wishing. More,\
  \ more, just a bit more.\nThen, she dumps something that smells like\u2026 like\
  \ roadkill\u2026 no, roadkill smells way better. Still, it looks like white fish.\
  \ I\u2019m puzzled. What could possibly be?\n\u201CThis, fafaru, raw fish marinated\
  \ in mitifafaru, seawater infused with rotting fish for ten days. This, delicious.\
  \ You must eat this,\u201D she says proudly.\nBut, I am not that eager. Forget the\
  \ smell, only the word rotting makes my stomach clench in disgust. And I have to\
  \ eat this? Please, no more!\nTo be polite, I take a bite, an itsy bitsy tiny one.\
  \ But, I spit it out right away. \nMy reaction amuses her terribly. She now tells\
  \ everyone about my love affair with fafaru. Soon, they are all half laughing, half\
  \ hiccuping. However, it\u2019s not a cruel, mocking laugh, it\u2019s warm and hearty.\
  \ I have no choice other than joining the laughter, hoping that the worst is now\
  \ behind me. But hope is never as close as we hope it to be. \n\u201CMore, try more.\
  \ With this,\u201D she continues, handing me a bottle of something that looks like\
  \ milky sak\xE9. \nIt would be wonderful if that\u2019s what it was. But I\u2019\
  m pretty sure it\u2019s not. And guess what? I\u2019m right.\n\u201CThis is Miti\
  \ Hue, fermented coconut milk with juice of river shrimp,\u201D she explains in\
  \ a cheerful tone. \u201CThis, delicious. You must try this.\u201D\nWonderful! Just\
  \ wonderful! Another delicacy. Just what I needed! \n\"Was the river shrimp left\
  \ to rot as well? Otherwise, what\u2019s the point of trying?\" I want to ask. \n\
  But, my self-preservation instinct tells me some things are best left unknown. Instead,\
  \ I thank her and check out the po\u2019e. It smells absolutely fantastic. \nMore,\
  \ more, I keep wishing."
