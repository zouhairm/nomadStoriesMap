Text: "I\u2019m stopped at a junction, engine idling. Crows stare down from their\
  \ vantage in the sky. The main path stretches westward. Down that road is the iconic\
  \ American Southwest, land of sculpted red rocks and flourishes of life.  I turn\
  \ away, veering onto a lonely road in the middle of nowhere New Mexico. Clouds of\
  \ dust track my passage. Today\u2019s destination is a different desert, a place\
  \ of bones and barren earth. \n\nUnmarked roads branch away, sometimes headed somewhere,\
  \ other times not. I question my course. This is land to get lost in after all.\
  \ A mangy dog watches me approach. I pass and he slinks off teeth barred. My only\
  \ company for miles. Eventually, my destination appears. Relief floods through me.\
  \ I\u2019m on the right path, but a knot still sits in my stomach. \n\nThree days\
  \ prior a storm blew through. It left behind landscapes dusted in snow. Only tracks\
  \ from one other vehicle mar the surface. I\u2019d come to escape, guess my wish\
  \ came true. \n\nA dry riverbed, an arroyo, hides from view. I walk into it. When\
  \ precipitation comes water collects here. Run-off shapes soft sedimentary rocks\
  \ into steep slopes and peculiar formations. Land here is foreign, planetary. I\u2019\
  m reminded of earth only by scattered sagebrush or rabbit tracks. This is a Badland.\
  \ \n\nI follow traces of water into strange territory. Each stride breaks though\
  \ a crust of snow and sand. Each step strips my fear and worry. There is no place\
  \ here for life\u2019s uncertainties. Here, in the cold, in the dry, I can release\
  \ the vastness of knowing. Replace it with the simplicity of existing. \n\nMushroom\
  \ shaped rocks cap slender spires of grey lining my way. These hoodoos rise ten,\
  \ twenty, and even thirty feet upwards. Their precarious positioning mirrors my\
  \ internal struggle. Rise up into the sky but risk falling. I come across one toppled\
  \ over, its tower crumbled from beneath. I breathe deep and move on.\n\nThe knot\
  \ in my stomach has grown. Ahead is an exposed beach of sand, free of snow, basking\
  \ in sunlight. Feeling sick, I lay down. Above a turkey vulture hovers waiting for\
  \ opportunity to present itself.  I\u2019m carrion, a devourer, never satiated and\
  \ always seeking. I wretch. \n\nIn land that doesn\u2019t doubt I sought solace.\
  \  I brought with me a lifetime of pain and self-doubt. De-Na-Zin Badlands took\
  \ my fear, devoured it for me. Buried it in a place too barren for something so\
  \ complex.  I stand up, turn around, and head back."
