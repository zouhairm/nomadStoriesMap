Text: "It was a late Eastern Europe summer of 2011. Not too hot nor too cold. Everyone\
  \ is mentally preparing for a winter freeze. It was my last day at summer job. My\
  \ friend caught my attention with an adequate idea where should I spend my hardly\
  \ earned money. Under our freshmen logic Eurotrip sounded like a riot against adulthood\
  \ and while the whole roundtrip cost only 200$ it happened to be the best decision\
  \ I have taken.\n\nApparently, late summer was only convenient for the ticket prices.\
  \ Our trip started at the edge of winter, when cold is inadequate to what we feel\
  \ and at particular moments you start to doubt your manhood. However, the first\
  \ part of the trip was finally over and luckily now we are going South. Three youngsters\
  \ probably unleashed for the first time in their lives looking for some action in\
  \ biggest cities of Europe. Bonjour Paris!\n\nFourth and last day in Paris brought\
  \ us to dilemma, whether we should go to the airport now and stay there for the\
  \ night or go sleepless dark and early in the morning. Simple pros & cons helped\
  \ us to decided and stay for a night in this mesmerizingly live and beautiful city.\
  \ We bought a bottle of overpriced cheapest wine from a nearby walking stranger,\
  \ sat somewhere at Champ de Mars and started our sleepless night with an occasional\
  \ laughter and freeze before Eiffel tower sparkles. What weirdly becomes most memorable\
  \ experience, considering now it is not allowed.\n\nAt 3 am we started our journey\
  \ to the airport. Short walk, subway, metro, short walk, shuttle bus, short walk\
  \ - airport, is what we planned but the most scenic subway which was disturbed by\
  \ four strangers and occasional noise of inconsistently flashing billboard light\
  \ already had something other in mind. \n\nThe timetable was lying. No trains were\
  \ coming for another two hours. Wakeup call came across with exaggerated panic of\
  \ the reality that trip might end here.\n\n'Bonjour!'\n\n'What? Hello!'\n\n'Woo\
  \ woo parle France?'\n\n'No'\n\nThe only other person at the station was a little\
  \ French woman and it was the last thing we expected to get the overview and a solution\
  \ to this situation from a local elder, who would probably not even speak English.\n\
  \n'Hello, you are waiting for a train, yes? Yesterday they informed about a strike.\
  \ Seems it was true. Where do you need to go?'\n\nShort walk, wait, run, bus, run,\
  \ bus, run, shuttle bus, run - airport, is what we have got with a perception of\
  \ a broken stereotype just because of this little French lady and her simple 'Hello'."
