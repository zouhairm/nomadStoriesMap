Text: "I was putting on my makeup before a Christmas gathering when the phone rang.\
  \ A call from Australia? The muffled voice of the Designated Person Ashore of a\
  \ medical tall ship in the South Pacific asked, \u201CWhat are the chances you would\
  \ be interested in joining our ship in Tahiti?\u201D My heart leapt at the offer.\
  \ Sailing. Serving. South Pacific Islands. It sounded like an opportunity of a lifetime.\
  \ One hour later, after a google map search of where Tahiti was, and an empowering\
  \ talk with my family, I gave a confident YES! They booked my flight that evening,\
  \ and three days later my father drove me through a snow storm to the airport. Though\
  \ mom worried about the crew I was to be alone with out at sea, I countered that\
  \ maybe one day I\u2019d tell my kids about this decision that led me to meet their\
  \ dad. Once again I found myself kissing them goodbye and sitting on the edge of\
  \ my seat, waiting for the next adventure.\n\n I fell in love with Tahiti\u2019\
  s island culture and way of life. It was easy and simple. Family mattered. Providing\
  \ for strangers like me, mattered. Sailing was simple. I fell in love with the sea,\
  \ the stars, a bunk that rocked me to sleep, with setting sails to catch every bit\
  \ of earth\u2019s magical wind. I began writing. I felt so close to the earth and\
  \ to myself. What to do for a month at sea but read, write, breathe? I simply existed.\
  \ I studied the sea, felt the wind, watched the waves for hours on end. As we braved\
  \ storms, I learnt to rely on the crew and on my own strength. My skin grew tough\
  \ and leathery from weeks in the harsh sun. Having no communication to the outside\
  \ world taught me how little things mattered.\n\n I spent an entire year onboard\
  \ the Ruach. From Tahiti to Australia to Papua New Guinea, I sweated profusely,\
  \ cried liberally and laughed freely. I taught island locals how to feel the wind\
  \ and change the sails. I cooked in the galley providing food and belonging to everyone\
  \ onboard, from locals to the Deputy Prime Minister of PNG. I got to speak up for\
  \ a country that is often overlooked. I played my role on this ship that continues\
  \ to provide health care to an 84% medically unreached PNG. I look back on that\
  \ cold Canadian Christmas with so much gratitude for that telephone call. Saying\
  \ Yes inspired a new way of life that continues to have a ripple effect bringing\
  \ wellness, simplicity and family wherever I go. Oh, and about that boy that I might\
  \ tell my kids about one day? He\u2019s a Pakistani German and is coming to meet\
  \ my mom next month!"
