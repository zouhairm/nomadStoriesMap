Text: "My first mistake was thinking that booking a walking tour over the Meetup app\
  \ was a good idea. Turns out, tourist-y stuff? Not their niche. So, when the promised\
  \  umbrella toting tour guide never showed \nup at the Hong Kong ferry terminal\
  \ for the walking tour of Lamma island? Less than surprised. Frustrated, but not\
  \ surprised - I only had two full days in Hong Kong, and there's was so much to\
  \ see!\n\nBut, damn it all, I had planned my day around hiking across Lamma island\
  \ and I wasn't changing my mind now! I bought my ticket to Sok Kwu Wan, and marched\
  \ onto that boat, head held high!\n\nMy second mistake was turning right at the\
  \ ferry terminal exit, instead of left - apparently there's a historic fishing village\
  \ that I completely missed. Either way, I turned right and headed in the direction\
  \ of Yung Shue Wan, the ferry terminal on the other side of the island.\n\nLamma\
  \ island isn't big, being less than 14km\xB2 (8.7 square miles, for those of you\
  \ from the 3 countries that haven't adopted the metric system), and with a population\
  \ of 5900 at the last sensus. It seems to run primarily on tourism, and foreign\
  \ expats. There are no roads, so the only real way to get from Sok Kwu Wan to Yung\
  \ Shue Wan is to walk the 14.6 km trail. \n\nAnd walk it you should! It really is\
  \ a beautiful trail, winding through a tropical forest and over peaks - not towering\
  \ peaks, but respectable vistas none that less. The Hong Kong Electric company,\
  \ which has a plant on the island, maintains a series of ecologist information boards\
  \ along the way. Little things, about the micoecology of forrest slopes, or the\
  \ animal life in estuaries.\n\nIt's a very peaceful hike, reading and walking, and\
  \ enjoying the view with a skewer of pineapple from one of the small carts dotted\
  \ along the way.\n\nGrowing up, I sometimes liked to watch old movie filmed along\
  \ the French Riviera - small, pale houses rose up through dense tree cover, always\
  \ clustered around a beach or dock. When I got to Hung Shin Yhe beach (after several\
  \ more wrong turns), all I could think was \"it feels like being in a Wes Anderson\
  \ movie\". The sand was a pale gold, and it was almost entirely empty, except for\
  \ one man reading on the beach. The only sound were the crashing waves and the muted\
  \ excitement of another group of tourists. Even the light felt like golden nostalgia.\
  \ I stayed awhile, watching the ocean, before heading back to the trail.\n\nA group\
  \ would have ruined it, I think."
