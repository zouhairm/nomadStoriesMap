Text: "Konglor is a lovely village in Central Laos. It's a small community in a valley\
  \ surrounded by the \u2018Stone Forest\u2019, and it is home to a cave, which is\
  \ 7.5km long and passes through a mountain, emerging at the tiny village of Ban\
  \ Natan. The journey through it is best taken by canoe.\nWe embark. Our driver has\
  \ a serious headlamp capable of piercing the inky black, ours are weaker.\nSoon\
  \ my head resembles a window-wiper as it sweeps from side to side, face upturned,\
  \ trying to decipher the surreal formations on the walls and ceiling of this wonderland.\n\
  After a short distance, we stop and get out.\nA path leads through the cave that\
  \ is almost lunar.\nStalagmites and stalactites abound, crystals shimmer, and rock\
  \ formations sprout from everywhere. With each step, the shadows thrown by our lights\
  \ on these formations are altered so they come to life and appear to move. The shapes\
  \ and sizes vary wildly. It\u2019s phenomenal.\nBack in the boat we go, and proceed\
  \ upriver. The cave then opens up. It\u2019s an enormous cavern, over 100 metres\
  \ high in places.\nThen things get weird! The driver kills the engine - voices are\
  \ approaching. Soon, we see headlamps and hear an engine. I assume that it's just\
  \ another group.\nNot so! Here we have a local farmer wading waist deep through\
  \ the water. Then, we can discern 2 shiny dots.\n\u2018What are they?\u2019\nSlowly\
  \ emerging from the gloom, appears the rounded body and horned head of a buffalo!\
  \ On a leash!\nI\u2019ve seen some things, but never did I see a man taking his\
  \ buffalo for a walk. In a cave! Down a river!\n\u2018Does that guy...? Does he...?\
  \ Do you see...? Is that a buffalo?\u2019\nThe open-mouthed, slack jawed \u2018\
  Eh, uh-huh\u2019 we each respond with is as much a question, a statement of astonishment\
  \ and a vote of confidence in our collective sanity!\nThe rest of our ride is, unsurprisingly,\
  \ relatively uneventful. All the while the ceiling and walls remain outlandish and\
  \ captivating.\nWe emerge in to the blinding sunlight at the other end to a wall\
  \ of grey cliff on our left and a sea of green foliage to our right. From above,\
  \ a beautiful shade of blue looks down upon us.\nWe alight and climb up the bank\
  \ to a leafy little shady glade and rest and refresh a short while before making\
  \ the return journey. This is much faster as we travel down river, over a few small\
  \ rapids and arrive back to our starting point.\nWe stroll over to the idyllic little\
  \ lake at the mouth of the cave and go for a swim in the perfectly refreshing water.\n\
  What a day! Magical! As for that buffalo? Well..."
