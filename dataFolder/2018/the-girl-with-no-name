Text: "They were all dogging, begging for me to buy their trinkets. \"One dollar,\
  \ lady! One dollar only!\", they chanted in unison. \nI just smiled like I always\
  \ do with relentless vendors throughout Southeast Asia.  I shook my head. \"T'lai\
  \ na!\", I exclaimed.  It means \"too expensive\" in Khmer tongue.  Finally, the\
  \ young squad saw another tourist coming out of the temple and turned to her.  \n\
  I walked slowly towards the main gate, my head bowed down, eyes locked onto my dusty\
  \ feet.  The nail polish is chipping and the veins of my feet appear lumpy.  It\
  \ was a little past noon and the heat was over 36 degrees.  \"Two more temples,\
  \ madam\", I remember the tuk-tuk driver saying.\nI'm parched. I can feel the sweat\
  \ dripping down my body. \"Two more temples, madam\", I keep hearing.\nI was lost\
  \ in my thoughts, my head still bowed down as I kept walking.  Then I saw another\
  \ pair of dusty feet plodding next to mine.  They were unshod, muddier....and smaller.\
  \  I turned to look at the little human striding down the path with me.  \"One dollar,\
  \ lady\", she said softly, showing me a handful of familiar-looking bracelets.\n\
  She's about twelve.  Her hair was tied in a low ponytail.  Her crispy chocolate\
  \ brown skin looked dry and inflamed, probably by the extreme heat in Siem Reap.\n\
  I slowed down my pace.  I wiggled my wrist to show her the wooden bangles that I\
  \ was wearing.  She had that look in her eyes, not of envy but of awe.  She murmured\
  \ \"Beautiful.\"\nShe kept walking next to me.  This time, she wasn't humming prices\
  \ of her beads.  She told me she doesn't go to school. I asked why.  \"No, no...no\
  \ money...poor...\" Suddenly she stopped to say \"Smell good!\", pointing her finger\
  \ at me.  I smiled, pulled out a small bottle of perfume from my tote bag and offered\
  \ it to her.  It's a sugary sweet vanilla-infused perfume that I've been using for\
  \ years.  She shook her head.  I almost laughed seeing how frantic she got.  I told\
  \ her I'm giving it to her as a gift.  Still, she shoved my hand away.\nI then pulled\
  \ out my camera and asked her to smile.  She willingly obliged with a bashful grin.\
  \  I said \"Akun\" which means \"Thank you\".  \nWhen I was about to head for the\
  \ exit, though, she tugged my elbow gently and said \"One dollar\".   I was baffled\
  \ for a second.  Then she pointed to my camera.  I was giggling when I handed her\
  \ a dollar.  I didn't even get her name.  \nShe'd always be \"the girl with no name\"\
  \ on my photo gallery, but that chance meeting was a game changer - I decided to\
  \ become an ESL teacher."
