Text: "A place I never expected was San Cipriano. I first went there in the late 90s,\
  \ and getting to this small ramshackle village in Colombia was part of the adventure.\
  \ Located on the Pacific side of the Andes, the journey entailed a bus from Cali\
  \ and getting off 25 minutes before getting to the port of Buenaventura. There are\
  \ no roads nor any way of getting to this small village other than a single old\
  \ train track to a disused coal mine up in the jungle-topped mountains. To my surprise,\
  \ the ingenious people of San Cipriano had devised wooden contraptions that they\
  \ placed on the narrow gage tracks and run using skateboard wheels. After negotiating,\
  \ one of the men set me and a couple of villagers on the device and we started moving\
  \ as he propelled us by using a big stick and pushing, as a punter would do on the\
  \ river Cam, or the gondoliers in Venice. Only that instead of water, we were flowing\
  \ through tracks and careening deeper and deeper into the jungle.\n\nI was exhilarated\
  \ by the speed, but also the sense of leaving the chaotic world behind and immersing\
  \ myself into a green tropical tunnel. As we advanced, the humidity seemed to increase,\
  \ as did the density of the jungle. After thirty minutes or so, we were there. The\
  \ destination was a single dirt road with wooden shack homes, and to the right hand\
  \ side, a beautiful pristine river with crystal clear water. There was a bigger\
  \ house where they rented rooms, and I stayed for three amazingly peaceful days.\n\
  \nI very quickly met most of the people in the friendly village, and spent hours\
  \ chatting with a fun group that gathered outside a small shop where they also served\
  \ coffee. What amazed me was how time runs differently in San Cipriano. Yes, one\
  \ could go on adventurous walks or swim in the river. But the best was just standing\
  \ still and letting the place and its people dictate the experience\u2026 it rained\
  \ on and off on the afternoons and we just sat under the eaves of the \u2018caf\xE9\
  \u2019 contemplating the surroundings or absorbed in thought. Conversations would\
  \ be extended, people spoke as if savoring every word, and nobody there seemed embarrassed\
  \ by prolonged silences, or at least that\u2019s what it seemed to me at the time.\
  \ I know that behind the idyllic experience I had there are many hardships and travails,\
  \ or that what for me was picturesque and remote can be a real drawback for the\
  \ people living there, but I always left San Cirpriano feeling that a day there\
  \ was worth three in the outside world."
