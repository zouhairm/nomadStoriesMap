Text: "Alarm clock finally rung at 7a.m. After visiting Neuschwanstein, Linderhoff\
  \ and Herrenchimsee castles it was time to pay a visit to king\u2019s Ludwig last\
  \ and not so famous castle Scachenhaus.  The weather conditions were ideal for a\
  \ hike to an altitude of 1866m. We advised the rest of the group that the hike to\
  \ the castle and back will take us only 5 hours but no one was paying much attention,\
  \ so we decided not to bother them with other details of the hike. \nAfter one hour\
  \ in a train from Munich we got off at Garmisch-Partenkirchen and we took a road\
  \ to the Partnach Klamm waterfalls. The beauty of the landscape and fresh Alpine\
  \ air made us sing \u201CI am Barbie girl in an Alpine world\u2026\u201D Our voices\
  \ quit when out of sudden our stroll turned into a 90 degrees steep hike. That steepness\
  \ lasted for a good three hours and we realised that actually it was 5 hours of\
  \ hike in only one direction. Just before reaching our \u201Ccastle\u201D we met\
  \ interesting Bavarian guy that asked us where we were from. After hearing words\
  \ China and Vietnam he proudly said: \u201CShanghai is not China. Vietnam is not\
  \ yet China!\u201D That comment kept us in a good spirit till our destination. We\
  \ did not have much time to spend at the peak because we needed to head back before\
  \ the sunset. After taking few selfies we chose an easier route to go back which\
  \ took us to Ferchensee instead of Garmisch.\nAt Ferchensee the last bus was gone\
  \ a long time ago. Called the taxi, no response. We were in the middle of nowhere,\
  \ with no human being to help us. It was obvious that we will spend our night in\
  \ the woods. And then out of sudden in this middle of nowhere a man was jogging\
  \ towards us. His apparel was so colorful that it was easy to notice him in the\
  \ dark. DW asked him for a taxi number but he said: \u201DYou know there is a car\
  \ (pointed in distance it was VW T4, mini truck), you can sit at the back. I will\
  \ ask my employees to take you to the Elmau and there you will take a shuttle for\
  \ Klais.\u201D\nWe were happy and confused at the same time. It was the best open,\
  \ dark drive of our life. And imagine this: suddenly we are in the yard of the castle\
  \ that is a luxury hotel. And then we got into a Mercedes shuttle that took us to\
  \ the train station. The driver told us that we were lucky because we are about\
  \ to catch the last train to Munich in this quarter, because from tomorrow railway\
  \ will be reconstructed.  After 50km of hiking we were saved by the manager of Schloss\
  \ Elmau to whom we never had a chance to say thank you."
