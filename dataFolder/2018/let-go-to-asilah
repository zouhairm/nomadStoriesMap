Text: "At 40 km south of #Tanger, the small city of # Asilah cited artists, has an\
  \ undeniable charm. The white and blue alleys of its medina, its many doors, its\
  \ craftsmanship, its sea air, its delicious fish, the feeling of peace and serenity\
  \ that emerges ... I had the pleasure of staying there 3 times , and each time Assilah\
  \ conquered me a little bit \U0001F49C\n\nMe who loves medinas and loves to lose\
  \ me in the maze of alleys, I was served! It's impossible not to succumb to the\
  \ charm of this ancient Portuguese stronghold, its many towers and the panoramic\
  \ view of the port that is offered from the Mirador de Caraquia!\n\nThe medina is\
  \ quietly visited, we enter through one of the many gates of the ramparts and we\
  \ let ourselves be guided by his instinct ... At every corner, flower pots, cats\
  \ taking a nap, beautiful colored doors , works of art ... Every summer, from mid-June\
  \ to mid-July, the walls of the Medina are adorned with the most beautiful canvases\
  \ of the streets, the artists giving free rein to their imagination during the annual\
  \ festival known as Cultural Moussem \U0001F58C\U0001F3A8\n\nIn Asilah, it is good\
  \ to take your time and stroll through the alleys, before making a small stop and\
  \ enjoy a delicious mint tea typical of the northern region (the same as in Chefchaouen\
  \ \U0001F609)!\n\nWhat better way to enjoy this serene atmosphere than to stay in\
  \ a pretty riad? My favorite address: Riad Hotel Al Alba! Located outside the medina\
  \ (about 10 minutes walk), beautifully decorated in shades of white and blue, the\
  \ kindness and hospitality of the riad guests will extend the feeling of peace that\
  \ surrounds us as soon as we arrive in the city. city \u200B\u200Bof artists ...\
  \ The rooms of the riad are charming, equipped with pretty bathrooms, bedding very\
  \ comfortable.\n\nThe breakfast is hearty and delicious: freshly squeezed orange\
  \ juice, fresh fruit, toast, olive oil, honey, olives, pastries and pastries (for\
  \ the most greedy), salty briouates (a real delight \U0001F60D) mashed tomatoes\
  \ with olive oil ... only good things to fill up with energy and to discover the\
  \ treasures of Assilah! And to taste good fresh fish, Casa Garcia and Chez Pepe\
  \ will delight your taste buds! \U0001F41F\n\nBig favorite for this pretty northern\
  \ coastal town and its charming Medina \U0001F49C"
