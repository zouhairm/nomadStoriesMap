Text: "Under a sun that had been absent for months, I was sauntering past Red Square\
  \ when I heard a catcall: Devotchka! Devotchka! \n\nThe guy was my age, with a wide\
  \ smile and laughing eyes. I lingered. His name, he said, delighted at his good\
  \ luck, was Dima. He was loitering on a street corner with his buddies, eating sunflower\
  \ seeds and passing a Coke bottle filled with what I was sure wasn\u2019t water.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019d been warned against gopniks, Moscow\u2019s subculture of street hooligans.\
  \ I didn\u2019t know if these were gopniks or not, but here was a chance to practice\
  \ my Russian. If they started acting dodgy, I\u2019d run.\n\nDima and I chatted\
  \ as we walked. He was 22, he said, living with his Mama and Papa, studying to be\
  \ a bus driver. I was telling him about teaching ESL when, nodding intently, he\
  \ strode face-first into a street sign. His buddies threw their heads back and roared.\
  \ No, I decided, these were not gopniks, just run-of-the-mill fl\xE2neurs. \n\n\
  Our escapade took us to Moscow\u2019s underworld of tracks and tunnels. Flaunting\
  \ the taboo of never making eye contact on the Metro, Dima smiled hello to everyone\
  \ we passed. They glared, as good etiquette dictated. \n\nOn the escalator to the\
  \ surface, Dima named things for me in Russian: man, woman, book, hat, shoe. Across\
  \ the way, a Militsia descended in full regalia, all crisp folds and shiny buttons.\
  \ \n\nDima elbowed me. \u201CMusor,\u201D he whispered.\n\n\u201CMusor!\u201D I\
  \ echoed. The Militsia snarled at me, feral and loathing. Dima\u2019s buddies roared.\
  \ \n\nTopside, Dima pointed to a trash bin. \"This is musor. Musor is also what\
  \ we call Militsia.\"\n\n\u201COh,\u201D I laughed. \u201CIn America, we call them\
  \ \u2018pigs.\u2019\u201D I pushed up my nose and oinked.\n\nOne by one, his friends\
  \ trailed away. Dima and I strolled through snowy Victory Park as the light dimmed.\
  \ We met an old man among the bronze memorials, hands clasped behind his back. Dima\
  \ greeted him, introducing me as American. \n\n\u201CWhat do you think of Moscow?\u201D\
  \ the man asked.\n \nHow to reply? It was made of contradictions\u2014palaces and\
  \ cathedrals stood two streets down from broken roads and decaying krushchyovkas.\
  \ People were cold, aggressive, black-humored, but also somehow the friendliest\
  \ I\u2019d ever met. Complete strangers often went out of their way to help me find\
  \ the Metro. Today I\u2019d thought I was going to get mugged, but had instead made\
  \ a friend. \n\nFinally, I said, \u201CIt\u2019s a big, beautiful city.\u201D The\
  \ man nodded his head, as if to say, \"I thought as much.\" He wished us a good\
  \ evening and shuffled away, alone, into the deepening twilight."
