Text: "\u201CChe bella sciarpa, dear, your scarf matches my coat!\u201D The older\
  \ man\u2019s voice easily carried over the expansive Piazza della Rotunda, and I\
  \ found myself grinning back in spite of the obvious ploy to draw me into the caf\xE9\
  \ he managed.\n\nTruth be told, I needed a damn break.\n\nI\u2019d left my apartment\
  \ in a full-blown panic attack not ten minutes prior, stumbling into the cobblestone\
  \ street and trying to anchor myself to reality with frantic lungfuls of cold January\
  \ air. These health issues had morphed a thrilling trip into a crash-course in how\
  \ to survive when absolutely nothing goes to plan, and I was determined to salvage\
  \ my last few days in Italy.\n\nSo, when Massimiliano (\u201CPer favore, friend,\
  \ call me Massy\u201D) waved me over to his ristorante with a kind smile, I obliged.\n\
  \nMassy was a short, lean man with gray hair, a cheeky laugh, and an unmatched love\
  \ for life. I\u2019d never met someone so well suited to their career. Whether he\u2019\
  s psychic or just shrewdly perceptive remains up for debate, but he certainly caught\
  \ the exhaustion etched in my eyes because he\u2019d guided me to a wicker chair\
  \ with a stunning view of the Pantheon\u2019s portico not ten meters away before\
  \ I\u2019d even given my name. I accepted the steaming cioccolata when he returned,\
  \ exhausted and suddenly grateful it wasn\u2019t the highly concentrated espresso\
  \ I\u2019d initially sought.\n\nWe sat on the porch of his empty caf\xE9 for two\
  \ hours, trading life stories and marveling as sunlight began to pour over the Pantheon\u2019\
  s coffered dome. It was easy to imagine Emperor Hadrian rebuilding this grand temple\
  \ in 117 A.D. and I found myself intoxicated by a fresh warmth and ancient history,\
  \ drawing strength from my new friend and his world. When I finally rose to leave,\
  \ feeling better than I had in weeks, Massy left me with words set firmly in the\
  \ present:\n\n\u201CStrangers are how we can know the world, s\xEC? We talk to strangers,\
  \ and we learn about the world. About ourselves.\u201D\n\nI have no memory of what\
  \ prompted that response. I\u2019m not sure it matters. In that moment, I finally\
  \ knew why he\u2019d taken the time to sit down with a haggard young American: I\
  \ was one more global reality, someone with the key to a bit of the world, a bit\
  \ of himself he\u2019d yet to discover. I was so caught up in my gratitude for his\
  \ company that it never occurred to me that, for him, I was a conversation worth\
  \ having.\n\nI would only realize later that he\u2019d managed to talk me down from\
  \ the panic attack that could have ruined the rest of my time in ancient, beautiful\
  \ Rome."
