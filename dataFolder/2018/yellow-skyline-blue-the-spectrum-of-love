Text: 'I was deeply in love with a girl from Thailand. The first was true blue, nurse
  & police officer. Her vocation was found in the healing of others, as is it with
  me. Honorable, hard working, loyal and heart warming. But alas, it could not be.


  We separated before we met, but I still carry her in my heart. We''re still friends
  too. My hope is that she will find the Prince of her heart, she deserves as much
  for her dedication to family & work.


  The lady I met, Kate, was beautiful too. Sane qualities, fierce and regal. Wise
  beyond her years. We decided to meet, & so we did. Booked for my birthday in August.
  At the time, a calamity occurred & she begged me not to come. The fateful date of
  a significant terror event which actually rocked the world. I told her, "I won''t
  live in fear." So I came.


  My heart is strong, like that. And I noticed how strong the people of Thailand were
  on response. A calm, measured response. Brave people who love their country & king.

  It was one of the happiest moments in my life. Defiant & humble, much to aspire
  to be.

  And the parallel between our Royal family, Prince Charles, in particular was easy
  to see. So I left with hope and a renewed respect. A King who cares about his country,
  the environment, the loves he has. All duty bound, and honorable, at lesft on my
  eyes.


  I hope to return, some day. But Thailand will always be in my heart.'
