Text: "In a mind for a once in a lifetime experience, we went for The White Water\
  \ Rafting in Rishikesh. Only with the excitement for rafting we started off from\
  \ Delhi to Rishikesh, without even knowing where we will be staying or who is going\
  \ to take us on rafting. But before we reached we did finalize a place to stay in.\n\
  \  The camp that we stayed in took us on trekking and rock climbing. The tents were\
  \ pitched on the bank of the river, with the backdrop of mountains, the stones and\
  \ rocks in colors of grey, blue and indigo besides the usual hues. The camp organizer\
  \ had also arranged us the instructor for rafting. The last thing I, actually we\
  \ expected was a little boy giving instructions and our lives in his hands and words\
  \ literally. He is a local from the city, as we were all beginners in speaking Hindi,\
  \ it was quite a task for both him and us to understand one another. Ours was actually\
  \ paid for a 16kms rafting, but from what we heard from our friends who have been\
  \ to rafting earlier, we paid extra for a 24kms rafting.\n  With all smiles and\
  \ jitters we rowed into the river. The last thing, to be honest that we never expected\
  \ happened. We successfully crossed the first two rapids. The third rapid called\
  \ \"The Three Blind Mines\" is apparently the most dangerous rapid of the river.\
  \ Well, it has three rapids in it, of which the first two are the fiercest. We didn't\
  \ realize that even after crossing the first one blinded by the adrenaline rush.\
  \ Soon into the second one the boat just toppled against the waves. With no time\
  \ to think of what happened, all of us were struggling, almost drowning in the water.\
  \ Each of us on different directions in the river trying to reach the bank or the\
  \ boat which our little instructor managed to turn it around. With a five to ten\
  \ seconds window we all made it out alive. It just didn't end there we were supposed\
  \ to continue the rafting until we complete the entire 24kms to get out of the river.\
  \ In spite of the fear and shock we stepped into the boat. Even in the river was\
  \ a pit stop on the rocks of the sides, to refuel our energy. A plate of hot maggie\
  \ did help us get out of the shock and shiver.\n  The tremble lasted for weeks.\
  \ But we all had an experience of our own to share and talk about for hours. The\
  \ endless conversations about what would have happened if we hadn't made it. The\
  \ trip was not only an item crossed of from our bucket list but also the realization\
  \ of the compassion and living in the moment."
