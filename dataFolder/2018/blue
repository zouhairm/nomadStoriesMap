Text: "Blue is planet earth\u2019s favorite color. It dominates the mind and body\
  \ of the earth. If earth could ever think; it would think that water is its creator\
  \ and lover. If earth could ever visualize itself; it would see millions of square\
  \ miles of vast pure blue. No wonder our fascination with the amount of blue we\
  \ see all around that earth. From natural hot pools bubbling with warmness in the\
  \ middle of the ice cold mountains of Iceland, to the open oceans that surround\
  \ with their mighty dominance the tiny exotic Philippine islands.\n\nYes, the Philippines,\
  \ that\u2019s where the story begins.\n\nThe location: Oslob municipality in the\
  \ Island of Cebu, the Philippines. The time: December 2016, marking the end of a\
  \ new year and 30 years of my youth. Embarking onto a challenge of being a true\
  \ adult with the heart of a little kid still so inspired to roam the earth but shyly\
  \ scared at the thought of deep oceans.\n\nIt was the 26th of December when I encountered\
  \ him\u2026 \u201CBlue\u201D.\n\nThere just a mile into the North Atlantic Ocean\
  \ away from the near shore, riding on one of the small Palawan kayaks with 13 other\
  \ travel buddies.\n\n\u201CWe are going to stop next to these other kayaks here,\
  \ and you are going to slowly get into the water.\u201D instructed the kayak operator\
  \ calmly as we were getting  closer to the spot.\n\n\u201CPlease don\u2019t make\
  \ any splashes with your snorkeling gear and don\u2019t come too close.\u201D\n\n\
  \ \u201CDon\u2019t scare the shark please\u201D!\n\nThe first few seconds into the\
  \ water were nerve wracking, but as soon as I breathed into my snorkel and dipped\
  \ my head inside that realm, I had transformed. The graciousness of movement unlikely\
  \ of a giant, the flickering white dots on his silvery grey body seducing my eyes\
  \ into coming closer, the peacefulness by which he slowly opens his toothless mouth\
  \ to catch the little organisms in the water was not only enchanting but life changing.\n\
  \nIf you had asked me just a month prior how would you feel like playfully swimming\
  \ with a whale shark in the middle of the ocean, I would have called you either\
  \ crazy or stupid. Yeah I found myself in travelling, but I wasn\u2019t the type\
  \ of person who was completely at peace when dealing with instinctive fears of unknown\
  \ depths, faraway lands, and huge mermaids!\n\nI had lost my fear in the Philippines\
  \ December 2016 with a shark that was not really a shark in the stereotypical \u201C\
  Jaws\u201D sense, No, he was \u201CBlue\u201D the huge mermaid dotted friend."
