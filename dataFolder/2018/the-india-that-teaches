Text: "I met Gopal last summer, when I decided to spend one month in India doing some\
  \ volunteering with street children. I found a place in an Indian NGO, called Smile,\
  \ in Kolkata, where I taught children basic English, played with them, provided\
  \ meals and support to their mothers. That summer was muggy, as summers in India\
  \ are. The NGO\u2019s facility was right at the boundary of the so called \u201C\
  inner ring\u201D, on a dirt road surrounded by some impressive Bargads. I arrived\
  \ in a humid, middle-July afternoon, on Smile\u2019s rusty van, my shirt stuck on\
  \ my skin, already one with it. Greeted by four or five stray dogs and a little\
  \ group of children, I was invited to join the volunteers for dinner. The first\
  \ time I met Gopal, he was sitting on the floor, drawing some freaky figures on\
  \ a sheet of paper. As I entered the room, he gazed right at me. I will never forget\
  \ such an intense look, so vivid that I felt as if a bullet had pierced my heart.\
  \ Later on, I was told that his family was one of the thousands emigrating from\
  \ Bangladesh during the last refugee wave. Having to look after two little children,\
  \ his mother was struggling to find a job when they arrived in Kolkata. During the\
  \ month, Gopal became my little brother: he spent all the day next to me. He did\
  \ not speak any English but the little we were teaching him, yet we could understand\
  \ each other perfectly: sometimes I would talk to him in Italian and he would reply,\
  \ seriously, in Bengali, then we would exchange a conspiratorial glance and burst\
  \ out laughing. At Smile we worked all the week from 8am to 6pm: streets were our\
  \ classrooms, slums our schools. However, Saturdays and Sundays were free, so I\
  \ could stroll around, visiting this city of contrasts. Misery could be seen at\
  \ every dusty corner, where beggars lived with just a rug as bed, and where little\
  \ children with filthy hair and grimy faces stared wide-eyed at the passersby, begging\
  \ for some food. Yes. Kolkata has two faces, symbolised by the Howrah Bridge: above\
  \ it, the hectic and modern Kolkata passes by, underneath it, flows the traditional\
  \ city, with its ancient rituals, as bathing in the river. One day I brought Gopal\
  \ with me. We went to the Maidan, the large park by the banks of the Hooghly River,\
  \ which houses the Victoria Memorial, a white, majestic building. Nearby, I bought\
  \ some Laddus from a street seller, and we watched a Cricket match. Gopal was so\
  \ amazed by players\u2019 speed, that he wanted to try as well. At sunset we moved\
  \ near to the river. Around us, people bathing and praying in the Hooghly."
