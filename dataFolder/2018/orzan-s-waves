Text: "It\u2019s morning and there\u2019s nothing good in the air. The rain falls,\
  \ ceaseless, since the previous night. The wind has risen and blows furiously creating\
  \ high waves. I venture out, trying to explore the area, even if everything suggests\
  \ to remain seated in a warm caf\xE8. I run into few people, along the promenade,\
  \ most of them are joggers. On the beach only one man with his dog. The area has\
  \ been closed by the police to beware of the danger the sea can cause. The sea,\
  \ that, during summer days, is quite calm and shine of all the possible shades of\
  \ blue, today, in a windy day like this, creates huge waves, high as walls; waves\
  \ that break with such a violence , on the water\u2019s egde, to discourage every\
  \ possible approach. A sea you can admire, from a distance, from a safe place; you\
  \ would never dream to be close to it. Nevertheless I come near it, attracted by\
  \ its music, by its strenght, but attracted, above all, by those tiny figures, that\
  \ seem to me, at a first glance, buoys, then, small black dots, that dive and seems\
  \ they are reharsing a dance, but, at a second glance, I identify as surfers. Someone\
  \ told me about those characters who, regardless of whether the weather is good\
  \ or bad, at the dawn, take their surf and face the sea; I didn\u2019t think I would\
  \ meet them today, but  it seems that this is the perfect day. They are several\
  \ and between those who go up the stream and those who wait in the line up, they\
  \ will be at least a dozen. I want to get closer, to be able to take a photo. I\
  \ slightly raise the police security tape to pass and I find myself in the forbidden\
  \ area; I  walk down the slop, trying to be unseen, even if nodoby cares about me,\
  \ and  finally reach the beach. And there it is, the right image I want to shoot.\
  \ Right in front of me, one of them is doing stretching before facing the waves,\
  \ leaning on his surfboard stuck into the sand. It is a posh, sinuous image and\
  \ the constrast between his diving suit and the colour of the sea is perfect. I\
  \ focus the lens and ready to steal the shot, when, suddently, he turns and greets\
  \ from the distance, waving his hand. I\u2019m alone there, so he\u2019s saying\
  \ hallo to me, I think. What I can do is to get close to him and ask permission\
  \ to take a photo.\u201Dhola\u201D he says. \u201Chola, que tal\u2026can I ask you\
  \ a question\u201D? He nods so I ask \u201C isnt\u2019 it dangerous to surf , today\u201D\
  ? \u201Cnot at all, bye\u201D and running with his surfboard under the arm, I see\
  \ him heading off to the deep sea."
