Text: "There's a little-known stretch of no man's land in Patagonia between Chile\
  \ and Argentina. Travelers on that winding gravel road have already had their passports\
  \ stamped as having officially exited Chile but they don't officially enter Argentina\
  \ until 7 miles later, when they get to another checkpoint and have their documents\
  \ inspected once again. Does this road belong to Chile or to Argentina? I never\
  \ did find out, even after driving it three times in one day.\nLeaving Chile seemed\
  \ simple enough: get our passports stamped then hit the road. Seven dusty miles\
  \ later we came upon a little outbuilding next to a pole that crossed the road.\
  \ There were men in military garb inside the outbuilding and I asked them if they\
  \ could please retract the pole. After asking to see our passports they pointed\
  \ back the way we'd come, indicating we needed to return to Chile. I said no, we\
  \ need to get to El Calafate and catch a plane in three hours. They kept pointing\
  \ to our passports, saying we needed a stamp. I showed them the stamp we'd just\
  \ gotten from Cerro Castillo but they shook their heads, no; we needed something\
  \ else. \nWe got back in the car and raced the seven miles back to Cerro Castillo.\
  \ There was a large tour bus parked outside the passport control building and I\
  \ could see the line out the door. Our plane wasn't gonna wait so I apologized profusely\
  \ and cut right to the front of the line, looking for the same woman who'd stamped\
  \ our passports earlier. What followed was a complete farce: we were both pointing\
  \ to my passport and yelling, she and I, and were both unable to make the other\
  \ understand. She just kept shaking her head and pointing to the stamp she'd put\
  \ in 30 minutes ago. This couldn't be happening. It felt like the Twilight Zone\
  \ as we headed back to the Argentinian checkpoint and braced ourselves for more\
  \ misunderstanding. I was prepared to resort to bribery. The same fellow looked\
  \ at our passports and, again, shook his head and pointed back to Chile. Unreal!\
  \ \nThen my mom opened her backpack and came out with two sheets of paper; paper\
  \ I hadn't seen since we'd left the Houston airport a few weeks earlier. As soon\
  \ as the border guard saw them he said 'yes!' and quickly stamped our passports.\
  \ What were these magical items hiding in my mom's bag? They were the receipts for\
  \ the Reciprocity Fee we'd paid in advance, in Houston. At the time we'd had no\
  \ idea what they were for but our travel agent had insisted we'd need them. She\
  \ was right!"
