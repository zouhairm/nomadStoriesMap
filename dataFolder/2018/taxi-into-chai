Text: "I left my ashram with only a 58 litre pack just shy of dawn. Darkness and dust\
  \ smothered the Himalayan air. The streets of Luxman Jhula brimmed a silent humming.\
  \ I could hear my footsteps echo as I moved across the bridge hovering over the\
  \ Ganga River. The bridge swung lightly as I stepped off to reach the taxi stand.\
  \ It was perfect, except my taxi wasn\u2019t there. I searched for the name of my\
  \ travel company on the two taxis already posted up and didn\u2019t see it.\nOne\
  \ of the drivers noticed my apprehension as I compared the discrepancy between my\
  \ receipt and the parked cars. He aggressively and said, \u201CMadame! You need\
  \ taxi!\u201D\n\u201CNo no, I have a taxi I\u2019m waiting for.\u201D\n\u201CYaaas,\
  \ Madame. This taxi. My taxi!\u201D\n\u201CNo, this one,\u201D I said. I showed\
  \ him my receipt stating the company and my 300 rupee deposit, a remaining 500 rupees\
  \ owing. He held the receipt and gave the number a call. We waited. He gave a blank\
  \ stare and hung up.\n\u201CNumber is nothing. Oh Madame, this taxi is no more today,\u201D\
  \ he said flatly.\nWhat\u2026 I thought. \nI felt my heart as it consumed my chest,\
  \ reaching to my collar bones and over the tops of my shoulders. Soon I felt it\
  \ in my entire body. I\u2019m scared, I thought. And it\u2019s dark. I felt my mind\
  \ beginning to seize. The man from the other taxi walked over. They exchanged a\
  \ word in Hindi and just stood, watching me.\nThe second man reiterated, \u201C\
  Your taxi is no here Madame. Your taxi is no longer.\u201D\n\u201CYes, it is,\u201D\
  \ I was getting frustrated. I felt my face heating. \u201CI already paid 300 rupees,\
  \ I only owe 500 now.\u201D\n\u201CNo, Madame, come with me for 1,000 rupees.\u201D\
  \n This wasn\u2019t right. I felt desolate. I felt nervous. I felt unprotected.\n\
  I was overwhelmed and felt I was approaching danger. My face was heating, beating,\
  \ and red and wet with salt. The drivers exchanged another word in Hindi. I only\
  \ understood there mannerisms as they shifted from aggressive to empathetic. The\
  \ first driver reached for my ticket and dialled his phone again. This time he spoke\
  \ on the phone, giving my heated face a feeling of calmness. \nHe hung up and said,\
  \ \u201CMadame, your taxi will be here in 10 minutes only.\u201D\nHe eyed the other\
  \ driver who graced us both with a tender smile. They both looked at me. Watching\
  \ close. \n\u201CChai?\u201D said the second driver.\nThe depth of my breath was\
  \ back. My tears began to dry, my face began to cool and my pounding heart settled.\
  \ I nodded.\nI sat with a chai in hand, protected by the darkness of the night by\
  \ my two new friends. My taxi arrived. I felt befriended. I felt safe. I felt protected."
