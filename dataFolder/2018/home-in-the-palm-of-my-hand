Text: "Javier was at home in the ocean. He dove underneath the waves, resurfacing\
  \ with handfuls of sand from the depths below. When he floated on his back, letting\
  \ his body rise and fall with the surf, there was just the hint of a smile on his\
  \ face. Watching him, I wished more than anything to feel at home here too.\n\n\
  I used to love the ocean. When I was a child, I spent hours splashing in the surf,\
  \ willing the water before me to churn even more ferociously. I never feared mysterious\
  \ sea creatures biting at my feet, never felt myself wrenched from the coast by\
  \ a riptide, never almost drowned. But one day, as if by magic, I felt afraid.\n\
  \nI was particularly afraid of this ocean, a stretch of the Pacific attached to\
  \ Manzanillo, a hot and humid city in Mexico. The waves crashed relentlessly against\
  \ the shore and there were dangerous currents along the coast. All I wanted to do\
  \ was go back to the beach, but I couldn\u2019t. I had made a commitment to Javier.\n\
  \nEarlier, I had inquired noncommittally about surfing, which everybody seemed to\
  \ do in Manzanillo. Then I was presented with Javier, who was tall and full-bodied\
  \ with just enough quiet dignity that the ocean should be afraid of him. I told\
  \ him honestly that I was terrified of the sea. He just smiled and replied that\
  \ with him, I would be safe.\n\nBut in the rippling water of the ocean, I didn\u2019\
  t feel safe. The surfboard felt like a clunky liability. Javier showed me how to\
  \ take the board through the oncoming waves, holding tight and bracing as the water\
  \ crashed over us. After passing under a wave I would lift my head, gasping, and\
  \ rub the salt from my eyes before bracing for the next one.\n\nAnd then, in the\
  \ distance, a big wave reared its head. I trembled on my surfboard. Javier looked\
  \ at me, told me to get off my board. \u201CDame tu mano,\u201D he said softly.\n\
  \nI slid off my board and slipped my hand into his. The wave towered over us. Together,\
  \ we dove underneath.\n\nA torrent of water crashed over us. I squeezed my eyes\
  \ shut, the world black while the ocean howled around me, trying to pull me along\
  \ with its current. And while water bombarded every inch of me, Javier\u2019s hand\
  \ stayed firm around mine, our palms pressed tightly together, fingers interlaced.\
  \ \n\nI wondered vaguely if Javier always held his students\u2019 hands underneath\
  \ the rough waves. But it didn\u2019t matter. Underneath that broiling water as\
  \ the ocean crashed overhead, a stranger extended a hand to me. And in the rough\
  \ ocean waters, I finally felt safe."
