Text: Am a medical student ,the life of a medical student is with full of books. But
  i dont like to stay full time books. At that time i created a page Yathrikar_traveller
  in instagram,Thats the turning point of my life,I created it for a timepass but
  i got so many travellers from that page.Its a page of full of traveling quotes now
  its 16.9k followers. One day i need a trip i dont know where i have to go. I catch
  two frnds from that page and i decide to go with them, the speciality is we three
  dont know where we are going and we three join the trip in three different places.
  After the third one join we simply talk a about a place and we decide thats our
  target and it was a newyear trip. The place is GOA(INDIA), some times the planned
  trips may put me boring but this was an amazing one, we three two boys and one girls,there
  is no rules and restrictions and we shared our money and food each other.. we reached
  there around 11pm 31st december,we simply walk through the road and we reached a
  beach. The reaction from the people to her is very bad they try to abuses her at
  that time we  react it in bad manner ,we enjoyed it with a ride and night sleep
  in beach,watching sun set and sun rise.. its an amazing trip in ma life and this
  is the day that i dreamed before..
