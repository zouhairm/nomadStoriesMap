Text: "After we remove our shoes, the waiter bowed and greeted us with an \u201Cirasshaimase\u201D\
  \ and some other words I couldn\u2019t recognize. With bare foot we followed him\
  \ to one of the low free tables. We sat crossed-legged over a cushion and we ate\
  \ Okonomiyaki, a kind of pancake in which you can put vegetables, shrimps, bacon\u2026\
  \ The light, coming from a wooden squared ceiling lamp, was dim and the tables were\
  \ separated by panel dividers. That reflect the high value that Japanese people\
  \ give to privacy. I looked at him, how could I be in love with him? He was shorter\
  \ than me, without my dream wide shoulders and, besides, he had a JAPANESE face!\
  \ Before going to Japan I thought that all Japanese guys looked very feminine and\
  \ had no sex-appeal at all. But Little Prince answered me: \u201COnly the heart\
  \ can see clearly; the most important things are invisible to the eye\u201D. We\
  \ talked about trivial things, such as what where the ingredients of the okonomiyaki,\
  \ and about more philosophical issues like passions and paths in life. Then I realized\
  \ that even having grown up in a very different society, religion and influences\
  \ we both have the same concern whether we are taking the right path in life or\
  \ not. I remember something he told me: \u201CIf someday I\u2019m tired of working\
  \ as a doctor, the fact of having people in front of me with the need to be healed\
  \ will make me work hard and never give up. This is something other professions\
  \ don\u2019t have\u201D. And afterwards, he explained me something that surprised\
  \ me, considering that Japanese people tend to keep to themselves. He told me that\
  \ he couldn\u2019t say a last goodbye to his brother, who died because of a thymus\
  \ cancer with 15 years old. After speaking about his feelings for a while, he changed\
  \ the subject and we ended up discussing and laughing if the rubbish I saw on the\
  \ beach the previous day came from Korea by the sea or it was from Japan. We went\
  \ out at 10pm, it was already dark and I felt the humidity of the air on my skin\
  \ and hair. I looked up and saw a lot of stars shining in the sky, it was so beautiful.\
  \ I turned to him and said: -I\u2019m happy I chose Izumo instead of Tokyo to do\
  \ the internship.  Then he asked: - I have sake from Kyoto at home; do you want\
  \ to try it? - Sure, let\u2019s try it- I replied, keeping my excitement and desire\
  \ to run and shout as loud as I could. After that night I can confirm Japanese Gods\
  \ understand Spanish, because they made my dream come true. The dream I prayed for\
  \ in the shrine we visited some days before with Mai."
