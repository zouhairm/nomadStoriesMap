Text: "Morning of September 10th , 2017, and Havana was deserted. That night a strange\
  \ visitor had came to the capital: hurricane Irma. Everything was silent, no one\
  \ was in the streets and the roar of water was the single noise you could hear.\
  \ Since midnight the entire city was without lights and water and completely isolated.\
  \ The scene was different than what I had expected.\nAs soon as I turned the corner\
  \ I found the life I had learnt to know in the days before. Even if the water swamped\
  \ almost the half of the city, even if everything was closed, the strong and positive\
  \ spirit of the locals remained the same. Walking I met three or four children playing\
  \ in a puddle like it was the most wonderful game in the world. Up ahead, there\
  \ was an entire barefooted family sat on a fallen tree trunk like it was a ship\
  \ that could go anywhere they wanted. All of this happened under the serious eyes\
  \ of Jose Mart\xEC\u2019s marble bust with the inscription: those that don\u2019\
  t believe in immortality, believe in history.\nI strongly believe in the history\
  \ of these people, in its honesty, in its dignity. I kept on walking until I arrived\
  \ at a park, it was full of fallen trees, but a group of children was playing  f\xF9\
  tbol like it was an obstacle course. I sat at the feet of Simon Bolivar\u2019s bronze\
  \ statue and I started to take pictures of them. At certain point I noticed a man,\
  \ not too young not too old, who was setting up an improvised bookstall. He was\
  \ selling a lot of weird things so that unusual scene stimulated my curiosity. I\
  \ came closer and I started to browse. Without a specific question he started to\
  \ tell me his entire life. He was a bookseller, but he hadn\u2019t a bookshop, so\
  \ he decided to be a peddler. He told me he wasn\u2019t sorry for that, because\
  \ this permitted him to know a lot of people and to share his books in inaccessible\
  \ places.\nThe inhabitants had a deeply-rooted sense of culture, because most of\
  \ them remembered how it was difficult to go to school in the past few years. So\
  \ hurricane Irma, that brought poverty, where the misery was a daily problem, taught\
  \ me that the temperament and the self-respect of those people can\u2019t be crushed.\
  \ As result I realized that the different hurricane is the hurricane inside me.\
  \ Cuba taught me to take a good measure of things, that happiness isn\u2019t an\
  \ object, but as someone wrote, it is in \"kids laugh when they're hungry an' they\
  \ know supper's ready\". That\u2019s what Cuba taught me. Cuba unchained an hurricane\
  \ inside me, and it didn\u2019t stop when I left."
