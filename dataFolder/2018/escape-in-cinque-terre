Text: "Last year I undertook my first travel in solitary to discover the coast of\
  \ Liguria. While my train was moving away from home, I was torn between excitement\
  \ and anxiety. I reached my youth hostel at midnight  in La Spezia, where I was\
  \ welcomed with warmth and kindness. My fears immediately faded away. The following\
  \ day I woke up early leaving to Cinque Terre. It is an area registered as a worldwide\
  \ heritage site since 1997, made of five colorful quaint towns located on the rugged\
  \ coastline. A hiking trail connects these villages, distant from each other by\
  \ one hour walk. \nAfter passing a gate to pay the fee access, landscape immediately\
  \ takes your breath out. It was eight when I started climbing and the sun was already\
  \ hammering. Through the foliage of olive trees, I contemplated sunlight glowed\
  \ in reflects of mineral waves. I had to stop many times along the way to stare\
  \ at these sceneries submerged by a gratitude to live such a stunning experience.\
  \ Even more when I realized hikers had disappeared in the distance. I was only surrounded\
  \ by a peaceful silence. It magnified my sensitive consciousness of the present\
  \ : my body, my emotions and Nature. I listened to the subtle breeze in the foliage,\
  \ the snap of twigs under my feet, and soothing lappings of the waves far away.\
  \ Leaves drew a delicate pattern of shadows on the steep ground, dancing with the\
  \ mild blast of air. I was absorbed by my thoughts and lost all sense of time and\
  \ reality. I did not know how far was Vernazza, my first waypoint. I suddenly felt\
  \ a sense of weakness and the tears run down my cheeks. It was a combination of\
  \ overwhelming beauty and hardship of loneliness. After a few minutes sitting next\
  \ to a trickle of water, I arose and continued my route in the middle of pine woods\
  \ and vineyards. Later another gripping spectacle mesmerized me. I had finally reached\
  \ the end of the first section. As soon as I entered in the village I was transported\
  \ by the dazzling animation of vibrant streets, full of trattorias and fish stools\
  \ without forgetting the staple of Ligurian cuisine, handmade pesto with its inimitable\
  \ taste. I rambled along the wharfs of the small marina, before I escaped from the\
  \ crowd to delight a deserved swim in this picturesque bay. From village to village,\
  \ the trail was even more breathtaking. I ended on the heights of Manarola where\
  \ I assisted at a shimmering reddening sunset, with a glass of white wine made in\
  \ a vineyard I had passed earlier."
