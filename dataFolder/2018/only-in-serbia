Text: "Arriving in Belgrade the first thing my Serbian cousin Ivan said to me after\
  \ 6 years was, \u201CMichael, you can sleep at my place, eat my food, drink my drinks,\
  \ you can even kiss my wife, but don\u2019t ever drive my [email\_protected]%$&\
  \ car!\u201D. A few days later, I received a phone call from my cousin Monica (Ivan\u2019\
  s sister) who lives in a little village called Kovin, an hour away from Belgrade.\
  \ My childhood holidays visiting Kovin consisted of feeding farm animals, using\
  \ an outside toilet and spending time in a tiny home with 6 other family members\
  \ sharing stories over Baba\u2019s home-cooked meals. Monica told me my uncle desperately\
  \ needed a ride from Kovin to Belgrade and somehow convinced me to take Ivan\u2019\
  s car to pick him up.\n\nThe next thing I knew I was speeding down a dead straight\
  \ road doing almost double limit with Serbian rap blasting through the speakers\
  \ of a ferociously fast European sports car, equipped with two pieces of information.\
  \ The first was that in Serbia you can drive as fast as you like, you\u2019ll never\
  \ get stopped by police. The second, a 20-dinar bribe can get you out of any trouble\
  \ with the cops. Apparently, you don\u2019t offer less as they\u2019ll get offended\
  \ and with any more than 20 you\u2019ll get milked. While staring off into the distance\
  \ at old war-torn buildings on the side of the road, flashing police lights in my\
  \ rear-view quickly stole my attention and my heart sank. \n\nA spine-chilling middle-aged\
  \ man with a thick black beard approached the car and began screaming at me. Now\
  \ I can speak Serbian, but when people speak quickly I have no idea what\u2019s\
  \ going on. So, I said \u201C\u017Dao mi je ne razumiju kada brzo govorite\u201D\
  \ (Sorry, I can\u2019t understand when you speak fast). He stopped, staring at me\
  \ for what felt like an eternity. \u201COdakle se?\u201D (where are you from?),\
  \ he questioned. \u201CAustralia\u201D, I responded. All of a sudden, this angry\
  \ Serbian policeman became the bubbliest character ever. \u201COh Australia, I love\
  \ Australia!\u201D. He began telling me about his daughter studying English and\
  \ his family in Sydney. Then just like that, he wrote me a ticket, smiled and was\
  \ gone.  \n\nI picked up my uncle, smoothed things over with Ivan and told my family\
  \ about what happened. They told me in Serbia it\u2019s extremely rare to receive\
  \ an on the spot speeding ticket, so I reached into my pocket and pulled out the\
  \ piece of paper. It wasn\u2019t a speeding ticket, it was his daughter\u2019s number.\
  \ As I looked down at Maria written on this crumpled bit of paper, I remember thinking\
  \ one thing - only in Serbia."
