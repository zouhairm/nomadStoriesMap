Text: "Morning,\nthere it was, the blast of the sun warming my eyes as the smell of\
  \ eggs, bread and coffee become stronger as I wake up, it was obvious morning but\
  \ I couldn't say what exactly time it was or when I fall asleep, my smartphone just\
  \ ruined out of battery, which didn't make a difference when you're in a place where\
  \ there is no wifi, no 3G, a real natural santuary where only peace of mind and\
  \ human face to face communication is allowed, and after a busy year of technology\
  \ and work, this is the nirvana for me, or should I say \"Mount Roraima\". Here,\
  \ in between Venezuela, Guyana and Brazil, the Mount is far more beautiful on the\
  \ top, than seeing from afar.\n\nLooking behind I can see Pareitepuy, the village\
  \ where our path began 4 days ago, climbing, walking, sharing meals and hugs. \n\
  You can enjoy alone too, put some headphones and immerge in your thoughts, I guarantee\
  \ that no one will disturbe you. \nMake sure to stop and silence everything around\
  \ you when you give a step on the top. My first step there I felt myself like Neil\
  \ Armstrong, I didn't arrived at the moon, but my inner self felt like it, the journey\
  \ is hard, you have to be prepare for it, mentally and physical, I felt my emotions\
  \ mixed when I thought I couldn't go to the top or when I slipped from a rock, but\
  \ I was there, finally in my own moon.  \n\nOn top of the mount you can feel the\
  \ cold of the clouds that shroud around, experience a unique opportunity to feel\
  \ the little black frogs, a expecie smaller than a finger, pass thru a incredible\
  \ magic field of crystals or bath into the natural waters, at night we can see the\
  \ stars closer and brighter than the camp fire in our cave, provided by the warm\
  \ of human interactions and in the morning with the adrenaline from adventure such\
  \ as the quicksand, I didn't know about it, but Mount Roraima has quicksands and\
  \ I just noticied it because I felt in one, every move I made was one step more\
  \ deep in, there was no one around to ask for help, just me, the backpack carried\
  \ and some flowers a few meters ahead, and they were my only chance, I throw myself\
  \ and grabbed the flowers pushing they as I fell the root breaking, able to push\
  \ myself out I breathe the adrenaline of almost dying and smiled for that blessed\
  \ and safe ground that I was. \n\nIn our way back to the city, Leticia, my adventure\
  \ friend asked me \"so... Now do you now how to answer that question?\"\n\"Which\
  \ one?\"\n\"About what to do with your life\"\n\"I think I did more than that, I\
  \ found life gratitude.\""
