Text: "I always had a dream to go to Peru for two reasons. Firstly, I wanted to visit\
  \ Machu Picchu as most of people around the world do. Secondly, as a surfer I love\
  \ to travel chasing the waves and Peru has one of the best and longest waves to\
  \ ride. However, I was worry about to take my board with me because I was going\
  \ to do the Inca trail. And it means leave my board behind. When I arrived, I realised\
  \ that I could take my board and left in the hotel that I was staying, and this\
  \ is normally what tourists do, they leave their belongings behind and taking just\
  \ the essential to the trail.  \nI arrived in Cuzco on the night before my four-day\
  \ track to Machu Picchu. Everybody says that you should allow at least two days\
  \ in Cuzco before you start the trail to get acclimatised to the altitude. I couldn\u2019\
  t match my flights to do that, so I worked out my state of mind to not have any\
  \ problems with the high-altitude symptoms. And It worked. The trip was breathtaking.\
  \ The Inca trail ahs an unique energy, the perfection of the track with its huge\
  \ stones most of time hard to walk on, its vegetation, the high mountains with women\
  \ shapes.  I was amused with all this beauty. I had an incredible experience in\
  \ Cuzco and Machu Picchu, but it was time to return to Lima. Once I arrived in the\
  \ airport I asked the drive to take me to Miraflores, the most famous of Lima\u2019\
  s suburb. It is o green that it's a big contrast with the others parts of the city,\
  \ which it looks like a desert. I found a super nice and cosy B&B right on the beach\
  \ in a calm and quiet area. I went for a walk in the neighbourhood and I was impressed\
  \ with the beauty that surround me. The walkway by the cliff made you feel as you\
  \ flying, the sea under with the surf pumping, the friendly people who I was crossing.\
  \ I went down the cliff to the beach. Once I arrived I saw a guy taking photos of\
  \ the surfers. We start talking and I asked him if he knew someone who I could rent\
  \ a bodyboard from. He told me that he was a bodyboarder and that he could lend\
  \ me one of his boards.  I couldn\u2019t believe it! The first person I talked with!\
  \  We went for a surf and I felt that I was exactly in the right place in the right\
  \ time.  Life always surprises you when you less expect.\nI really fell in love\
  \ with Peru and its people. People are very friendly which makes your trip much\
  \ more enjoyable. The synchronicities that happen there blowed my mind. The energy\
  \ of the country is amazing, and it is a bucket list place to be felt and seen."
