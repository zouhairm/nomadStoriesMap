Text: "I was feeling a mix of a bird in a cage and a fish out of water. I was asking\
  \ to me \u201CHow would you like to live your own life?\u201D So what better way\
  \ to find a path if not when you're completely lost?\nOn the 11th of October 2016\
  \ I started a trip around the archipelago of Canary Island with my backpack, my\
  \ fear and myself...I stayed a month in Tenerife, renting a house and a car but\
  \ still unsatisfied with myself. I understood that the \u201Cproblem\u201D was inside\
  \ me. \n I changed my plans and I bought a boat ticket to go to another island,\
  \ Gran Canaria. I started feeling the adrenaline of making one way tickets.\n I\
  \ arrived the next morning at Arguineguin, a small typical town in the south; I\
  \ didn\u2019t know where I could sleep until a kind girl brought me by car up to\
  \ a beautiful beach where could camp.\nThe days on this beach were totally fantastic,\
  \ no phones, no pc, no television, just a tend and some wood to make a small fire;\
  \ to get some food or beverage everybody had to walk from the beach around two \u201C\
  mountains\u201D called \u201Cbarrancos\u201D every time, but finally it became the\
  \ daily training for the body and the soul.\n In this place I started to feel freedom\
  \ in my blood. Day by day we were waking up with the sun and go to bed with the\
  \ moon, playing guitars and flute and dancing around a fire, smiling just because\
  \ you were sitting on the sand and near the Atlantic ocean in a perfect company,\
  \ eating typical food as \u201Cpapas arrugadas con mojo\u201D(potatoes with sauces\
  \ based on garlic) and \u201Cchurros\u201D, a sweet Spanish snack of fried dough\
  \ and sugar. It is the life of some of locals people. They teached to me how much\
  \ are beautiful and important the small things\u2026and the churros! \nI was slowly\
  \ forgiving my past, my mistakes, breaking down my mind\u2019s limits, and going\
  \ completely through my life and really I was living my own dream, travelling around\
  \ incredible isles, on my own, feeling lost and free.\nAfter fourteen days I decided\
  \ to go to Fuerteventura where I cannot forget the moment after twenty nights living\
  \ in a car, in front of a sunset on the beach of Punta de Jandia, in the south,\
  \ when I finally felt that happiness that seemed so far away. I felt my soul completely\
  \ free from every chain, my past become for me the best teacher I\u2019ve ever had\
  \ and I was feeling completely free.\nEverything that happen in our life is something\
  \ that can make us better people. I learned the secret to be able to say THANK YOU.\n\
  I dedicate this life to my grandparents and to my friends that are lights in the\
  \ universe now."
