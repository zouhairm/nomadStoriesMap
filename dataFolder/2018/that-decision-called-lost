Text: "A brief history about me, i am a girl from conservative army family (you can't\
  \ have sex before marriage, have a religion is a must). I am obedient girl that\
  \ never ever made any hassle to my parents in our little village, till.. i graduated,\
  \ had job in capital city of Indonesia, Jakarta. Joined expatriate group that made\
  \ me having new experience : dark life, i entered a club with the colorful traffic\
  \ light and loud full music that made my blood and body following it. It was only\
  \ one club, but i had experience to enjoy more than 5 best clubs in Jakarta every\
  \ week for the rest 3 years. Never ever this history of me be in my parents' ears.\n\
  My life was full of disguise truth, every Saturday was clubbing till 4 a.m and Sunday\
  \ is Cathedral time with parents, Monday till Friday worked with robotic persons\
  \ around my cubicle desk, i felt it awesome life! The best part to mention : I met\
  \ partner of crime in time. He is gorgeous man, he loves me. He took me to few countries\
  \ i never been. I really don't care about countries i stepped on, i wished to be\
  \ with him only. I made the scenario to my parents about my old phone broke so they\
  \ couldn't call me at all while i had too much fun in Hongkong and Macau for a week,\
  \ eating the real Chinese food, facing angry faces of them, shy to enter the toy\
  \ store (in my country, impossible to have this kind store) and very small hotel\
  \ to stay but expensive, got asked passport when entered casino in Macau because\
  \ of my baby face. Another scenario to Cambodia for another a week, visited beautiful\
  \ Angkor Wat temple while i wear my sexy dress that made me couldn't enter the sacred\
  \ temple, meh! We faced drunk Aboriginal in Darwin, Australia. \nHe promised me\
  \ to take me to see Europe, but we broke up. I lost him, I don't know what to do?\
  \ All i know, i flied for 26 hours Jakarta-Oman-Amsterdam by my self. Red light\
  \ district canals, Cannabis, Stoned feeling are Amsterdam, Finally before i die\
  \ i know what the taste of SNOW in Munich Germany, Beautiful old city Prague will\
  \ always in my mind. Glamorous city and wonderful Opera in Vienna amazed me, I can't\
  \ believe i walked for 5 km with 15 kg backpack to my hostel because in Venice Italy\
  \ no vehicle allowed! In winter very rare to see kissing couple in romantic city\
  \ called Paris. I experienced the fast train under the sea Paris-London, i thought\
  \ i could see fish, but no.  The decision that made me travel 8 countries in 40\
  \ days, just lost feeling. Yes, i know i could alive without him, but different"
