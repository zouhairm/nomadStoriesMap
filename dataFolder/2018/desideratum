Text: "When the light pierced the cloudy skies, and while the hospital walls were\
  \ lit gold, I made my decision then and there. This hospital visit differed from\
  \ the last one I made with professor Leo two months ago. Back then, I had someone\
  \ by my side who helped translate, and who too had once broken a leg. The Doctor\
  \ told me I\u2019d be on crutches for the remaining two and a half months of my\
  \ semester abroad, and I was saddened. But Leo filled me with inspiration after\
  \ the visit; that only in two months would the cast come off, and most importantly,\
  \ that I could continue my semester experiencing Peru with some of the best people\
  \ I\u2019ve met. I took his inspiration and hung it round my neck close to my heart\
  \ like a cross pendant, and through rain, mud, sludge, and rock, I slogged on.\n\
  But now I found myself alone in the large hospital room, without any empowering\
  \ words. I managed to battle salmonella in a remote Amazonian research station,\
  \ before being rushed to Cusco. On my fifth day in the hospital, Leo visited and\
  \ brought back bad tidings; that I\u2019d be released from my program in four days.\
  \ Leo did what he could to let me stay, but management didn\u2019t care. Leo gave\
  \ what advice he could before he had to go, but the gravity of this decision shocked\
  \ the bedridden me. I was entirely on mu own and faced with a grave decision; to\
  \ leave or stay in 96 hours. \nWhen faced difficulties, I used to seek solace in\
  \ the council of others, because I found out that others had suffered likewise.\
  \ But now I had no way of contacting my friends, and efforts to voice my feelings\
  \ to the nurses were feeble. A feeling of remoteness washed over me. There was a\
  \ rift between me and my dreams, and as it grew so did my estrangement from the\
  \ world. To build a bridge and cross the abyss beneath was terrifying. In this abyss\
  \ lay all my fears of traveling alone, and the what else would befall me if chose\
  \ to stay in Peru. The rift between me and my dreams would grow, until nothing remained.\
  \  \nAn icy shaft pierced my heart whenever I\u2019d think of all my friends, all\
  \ the good and the bad times we faced. But it was all over now; the dream of the\
  \ last two months was coming to an end, and my adventures would cease. But it was\
  \ not over until I said it was over; I chose to endure the following weeks on the\
  \ road in my condition no matter what it meant\u2026 I\u2019d be brave and endure\
  \ it all until the date on my original round trip ticket came due, and only then\
  \ could I accept that my journey would end."
