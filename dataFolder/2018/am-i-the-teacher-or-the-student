Text: "While backpacking through Australia we were asked to teach a French class in\
  \ a small town private school as a part of a cultural & language exchange for our\
  \ couch surfing host who happened to be the principal of the school. I can remember\
  \ standing in front of our new class of Australian middle school students, introducing\
  \ myself. I've done this a million times all around the globe but this time it was\
  \ different. I am a M\xE9tis Woman from Canada. When I introduce myself in another\
  \ country, I generally stick with one title \u2018Aboriginal\u2019 because it sums\
  \ up that I am a part of the people who are original to the land, original to Canada\
  \ eh! Besides most people outside of Canada, and sadly some Canadians as well, are\
  \ not familiar with the word M\xE9tis. On our first day I started off my introduction\
  \ with \"My name is Nicole, I am an Aboriginal Woman from Saskatchewan, Canada.\"\
  \ I took a breath to collect for my next sentence when I saw the smiles dropping\
  \ from their faces, mouths a gape, gasps and furrowed brows; it was mass confusion.\
  \ What was it that was confusing them? Was it Saskatchewan? Most people have no\
  \ idea where or what Saskatchewan is. Finally one of the students put his hand up.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYes, Josh?\u201D \n\n\u201CUmm... Teacher, did you say that you were\
  \ ABORIGINAL?\u201D \n\n\u201CYes! I am an Aboriginal Woman originally from the\
  \ province of Saskatchewan. Saskatchewan is a province in Canada.\u201D \n\nMy smile\
  \ quickly grew and a giggle escaped me as another moment of silence followed. *insert\
  \ cricket noises* They all looked so serious, they all looked stumped and so very\
  \ concerned. I just stood there with my head tilted and a big grin on my face as\
  \ we stared back at each other. Finally their teacher broke the silence to say:\
  \ \n\n\u201CNicole said that she is an Aboriginal Woman from CANADA. She meant that\
  \ she is Aboriginal to CANADA\u201D. \n\nThe students once again attempting to process\
  \ the sentence when suddenly it clicked. Josh, the same student that asked for clarification,\
  \ exclaimed out to his classmates: \n\n\u201CShe is ABORIGINAL, ABORIGINAL to CAN-A-DA!...\u201D\
  \ \n\nAll at once they seemed to lip the sentence to themselves. Their teacher then\
  \ gave a nod to indicate that I should continue with my introduction. These students\
  \ from that moment on were always very careful and very gentle in our interactions\
  \ and seemed to hang on my every word. I was an alien that they had never even heard\
  \ stories about, an alien from a foreign land. The word, the one word that was changed\
  \ forever I\u2019m sure.  Aboriginal."
