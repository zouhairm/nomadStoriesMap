Text: "(trek day)\nThe world dimmed out \nThe next day I woke up in a couch. I couldn\u2019\
  t grab back my memory but the place seemed nice. What made it even beautiful is\
  \ that a little girl cam running into the room and screamed,\u201D yay! Mommy! Daddy\
  \ woke up !!!\u201D\nThen a women came in the room with a pleasant smile and said,\u201D\
  \ Don\u2019t mind Emma. She calls all men daddy.. And do you want something to eat?\u201D\
  \nI was pretty confused. Then the women told me that I was passed out a mile away\
  \ from the house and she happened to see me when she was searching for her dog.\n\
  None of the other guys was there at the house. As welcoming as they were, I was\
  \ concerned. I had a delicious breakfast at their warm house and Emma blessed me\
  \ with so much happiness. In return, I thought Emma some math.\nThey called themselves\
  \ nomads and that they live away from the world without any connection. Literally.\
  \ They didn\u2019t have any electronic items and they made their own food and lived\
  \ a happy life.\nIt was so relieving to be in that place. Their presence enlightened\
  \ my soul. I kissed them goodbye and promised them that I will comeback and live\
  \ with them if that wasn\u2019t a problem.\nI smiled and started running down that\
  \ beautiful hill. Half hour down, I saw my lambo parked in the muddy road. Nothing\
  \ was weird and the location was so beautiful that I never wanted to leave.\nI would\
  \ be lying if  I said that the thoughts of ditching the world and living with them\
  \ didn\u2019t cross my mind. Intervals of tall trees in grassy land with soft sunshine\
  \ and soothing warm breeze was all so beautiful.\nWhen I reached the lambo, except\
  \ for the Allie-the vodoo girl, everybody else was passed out. She stared at me\
  \ in a weird way and said,\u201D You were kissed by a dark spirit\u201D\nHours passed\
  \ and we were starving. I took a walk with Allie back to the highway to ask for\
  \ help.There were literally no cars passing in that road. She had an hypnotizing\
  \ effect on me and I nodded along as she said her crazy idea. To lay in the middle\
  \ of the highway like the scene from the notebook.\nTick tok Tick Tok,time passed\
  \ and the fear disappeared. We heard a voice,\u201D No car ever crosses here child\u2026\
  \u201D an old man\u2019s voice\n\u201CYou might not want to be here alone when the\
  \ sun sleeps\u2026\u201D\nHe took us to his house that was a couple miles off the\
  \ highway. His wife Margery greeted us with love. It was an abandoned city and Ben\
  \ took us to a walk. Everything was beautiful and perfect except for one thing-\
  \ Sanity.\nSo much more to say.. this is just a fragment of my story.."
