Text: "Birches, birds singing and even smell reminded my motherland I hadn't seen\
  \ for 5 months - Russia. I would be really confused but modern trains kept reminding\
  \ me that I am in Germany, going to Bremen. I was starving and as vegetarian I was\
  \ scared not to find any food in the country of currywirst and klopse.\nJone, my\
  \ Chilean friend, insisted to leave our backpacks before we will find a place to\
  \ eat. The wooden door of our host reminded me the color of zucchini. In front of\
  \ it the tiny woman, Sara, in wide bright pants was smoking.  It was my first couchsurfing\
  \ experience and I saw it only as a free bed and the way to save money. Sara,our\
  \ couchsurfing host, hugged us and offered to share dinner. I didn't expect such\
  \ warmness from the person I met 2 minutes ago. My stereotyped mind was more expecting\
  \ to face thrifty German culture than hippie girl with a flower in her hair. \n\
  The whole house smelled with cinnamon and vanilla. Three girls, other housemates,\
  \ in wide pants and dreadlocks were cutting fruits, laughing and swinging there\
  \ hips to the rhythm of jazz music played in gramophone. The tough German language\
  \ sounded like twitter. Girls turned out to be vegetarian too and in 5 minutes the\
  \ table was covered by salads, pies, potatoes and sandwiches. Jone and I were tired\
  \ after journey and Sara showed us the whole house with its weird African sculptures,\
  \ black-and-white photos, film posters and piano. Sara offered us the whole room\
  \ while she decided to share bad with her housemate. \nWhen I woke up, it was completely\
  \ dark and Jone was not in the room. I found her sitting on the blanket on the pavement\
  \ in front of the house. Sara lighted candles and poured Jone's Chilean wine. I\
  \ returned to my room and joined girls with chocolate I saved from Russia.\nAnd\
  \ three people from different part of the world were sitting in the middle of the\
  \ street, watching stars and sharing their stories. Sometimes strangers were crossing\
  \ the street, waving us. We offered them wine or chocolate but most of them refused.\
  \ In one of the most capitalist country Sara and her housemates were the girls who\
  \ shared everything with each other. Even their salaries. And there, under the stars,\
  \ talking about communism and sharing, first time in my life I started to believe\
  \ that world based on honesty and love may exist. At least here. In Germany. This\
  \ night I didn't want to see the sun rising."
