Text: "It is natural that people barge into your personal sphere and do not leave\
  \ space to your loneliness in Lisbon. If you let them do it, you are never alone.\
  \ \nHowever I am attached to my solitude. After four months in Portugal, my new\
  \ friend knew it.\nIt was november and we left the city going south.\nDuarte explained\
  \ me that we were going in the \u201CReserva Natural do Estu\xE1rio do Sado\u201D\
  . It was a cloudy and drizzly day and we were surrounded by the water of a river.\
  \ Damp!\nLater I read the sign \u201CCarrasqueira\u201D. It was the name of the\
  \ village where I was about to spend a weekend. What impressed me were the straw\
  \ huts scattered among the Portoguese classical blue and white houses and the perception\
  \ that nobody lived inside. \u201CThose huts are the typical cabanas de palha of\
  \ Carrasqueira. And yes, about 300 people live here in the summer. Now it is november\
  \ and there is a fourth of the inhabitants\u201D, told me Duarte. \nWhile we were\
  \ around the village, I saw a lady watching curiously outside her window. Then Duarte\
  \ went inside a white and blue house. Oh, it was a tasca, a tavern. Inside there\
  \ was an old couple not expecting customers for dinner. They stared at us for some\
  \ seconds and then the man shout a Boa tarde!\nIt was the turning point towards\
  \ attentions, justifications because nobody expects people during the winter, reports\
  \ about their life and questions about ours. We did not order, but the table was\
  \ filled up with fish-based dishes and red wine and they sat with us. Two hours\
  \ passed eating and chatting in a homey atmosphere. \nBefore the sunrise I left\
  \ Duarte in his \"cabana\".\nAfter a minute walking in the desolated streets I was\
  \ on a path between a large rise field and an ochre beach. Istinctively I went on\
  \ the sand. My boots were getting wet. When I looked up, an old huge pile-dwelling\
  \ pier stood in front of me. \nI walked on the creaking pier up to the end where\
  \ the lasting poles of the destructed boardwalk stuck out the water. \nI was standing\
  \ on the border looking at the seagulls in the pink light and smiling. A familiar\
  \ shout made me feeling too romantic. Bom dia, Italiana! The owner of the  tasca\
  \ was on his wooden boat with other fishermen inquisitevely staring at me. \u201C\
  What are you going to do today?\u201D, asked me.  \nSo they docked the boat and\
  \ I got on. Bye bye, dear solitude.\nWe sailed in the pink and flat water. I was\
  \ going to be a fisher for a day. \nWho could expect that I would return to Lisbon\
  \ knotting new bonds with people to my net filled up with fresh fish?"
