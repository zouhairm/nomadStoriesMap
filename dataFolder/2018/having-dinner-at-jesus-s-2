Text: "The mid-afternoon sun warmth was brushing my back while I was dunking my feet\
  \ with all of the strains of the day into Rio Iso water. That icy surprise didn\u2019\
  t prevent my being enchanted by the flow of the water and made my thoughts stream,\
  \ too. \nAll the faces I had met on my way started going by - all those caring faces\
  \ I had met on my Camino de Santiago until that moment. I was in Ribadiso, a small\
  \ town almost 40 km to Santiago de Compostela. \nOver the centuries, along this\
  \ Camino walked by saints and sinners, people have truly learned what hospitality\
  \ is. \nOne of them was Juan, an old man waiting for pilgrims in a tiny chapel of\
  \ the countryside village Cacabelos, ready to witness their step into history with\
  \ a sello on their credencial. Or Maria Paz, ospitalera in Airexe that bumped into\
  \ me, lost in a village where the only inhabitants seemed to be a bunch of cows.\
  \  She kept asking how she could help me in Spanish, when I could only answer in\
  \ Italian. Juan, Maria Paz and other tender gazes made us pilgrims have the same\
  \ gaze on each person we would have met on the way to Santiago: pilgrims welcoming\
  \ other pilgrims.\nThanks to those travel companions, I heard of the hostel Ave\
  \ Fenix in Villafranca del Bierzo, a cute town built in grey stones among gentle\
  \ hills. Farmers there built a semi-natural beautiful pool called Playa Fluvial\
  \ in the closest point where Burbia river skims the town.\nAs soon as I entered\
  \ Ave Fenix I understood why pilgrims suggested that I go there and be hosted by\
  \ its owner Jesus Jato and his family.\nI would have never expected to be welcomed\
  \ as somebody who finally comes back home after a long journey. They didn\u2019\
  t even allow me to stand while I was in line asking for a bed: they made me sit\
  \ and offered me a tub filled with water, salt and vinegar to dip my feet and nurse\
  \ my blisters. After such a devoted reception, Jesus invited me to join the community\
  \ dinner at the hostel. \nWe entered a charming rustic dining room with stone walls\
  \ and exposed wood beams. There were just two long tables with benches, where I\
  \ could sit side by side with people from all over the world and taste sopa de trucha,\
  \ chorizo, cocido maragato combined with a glass of full-bodied Bierzo.\nWhat\u2019\
  s your name, where are you from and why are you walking along the Camino de Santiago:\
  \ those were the questions to meet those faces, sharing a trip that goes beyond\
  \ the mere walking.\nBeing hugged with such a familiar warmth makes you free to\
  \ be authentic, free to be yourself."
