Text: "The traffic crawled and my energy waned as I entered Calcutta. It was late\
  \ at night in the final days of an unforgettable 5 month journey through Northern\
  \ India. My ribcage rippled through my skin - evidence of the kind of weight-loss\
  \ that arises out of necessity, when survival mode kicks in and the body lets go\
  \ of everything that it does not need to carry. This was the first of many journeys\
  \ through India. In truth, I was exhausted and delighted to be en route to the sweet\
  \ coconuts and honey-skinned beaches of Southern Thailand.\nThe morning light stirred\
  \ me from my slumber and my gaze fell on the framed artwork beside my bed. The goddess\
  \ Kali stood naked on the body of her consort Shiva; her black skin glistening with\
  \ power, her blood-soaked tongue lolling out of her open mouth. Draped in a garland\
  \ of severed heads, her hands held a sword, a noose, the grotesque head of a demon\
  \ and the hand gesture which signifies that one should have no fear. In the Hindu\
  \ Pantheon, Kali is the energy of absolute freedom: She who destroys all that is\
  \ standing in the way of liberation. Calcutta is a city devoted to the fierce face\
  \ of the divine feminine and it is home to one of the four most powerful Devi temples\
  \ in all of India - The Kali Ghat. \nThe temple entrance swelled with thousands\
  \ of devotees, for this was a very special day to celebrate the goddess. The air\
  \ was thick and sour. The floor was sticky with the spilt blood of goat sacrifices.\
  \ The atmosphere intensified as I was pushed toward the main alter. The crowd was\
  \ writhing with an energy unlike anything I have ever felt. As I was squashed into\
  \ the main room I was shocked to see that the statue of Kali was not the glistening\
  \ woman that I had pondered as I drank my morning cup of tea. The deity herself\
  \ was completely abstract - a giant, bright orange, football-shaped form with three\
  \ thin black eyes, draped heavy with thousands of red hibiscus flowers. One of the\
  \ temple Pandits grabbed my arm and heaved me up onto the alter. He took oily orange\
  \ paste from the wall and smeared it across my forehead. I froze, in awe of the\
  \ sheer mayhem of my situation. The Pandit demanded money and wide-eyed, I handed\
  \ it over. He snatched it from my fingers, laughing maniacally as he threw me back\
  \ into the sea of people below. I somehow managed to swim my way to the exit and\
  \ collapsed down on the floor beside a group of women. One of the older women turned\
  \ to me with a knowing smile. \"Kali is love\" she said."
