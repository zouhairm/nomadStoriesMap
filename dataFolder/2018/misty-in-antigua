Text: "Misty\u2019s name belied her sunny disposition. I always looked forward to\
  \ our tutoring sessions in high school, when I would sit with her for a couple hours\
  \ on the weekend and practice English. That was years ago, when I was 16 and Misty\
  \ was 8. Although I hadn\u2019t thought of her for years, her sweet smile flashed\
  \ across my mind as my plane descended into Guatemala.\n\nGuatemala seemed far away\
  \ from my adolescence in south Georgia. It wasn\u2019t so much a country to me as\
  \ it was an explanation for why Misty had chickens in her yard and why there were\
  \ so many shoes lined up on her front porch. It was the place I toted whenever my\
  \ high school friends referred to \u201Cthe Mexicans\u201D in our town\u2014actually,\
  \ some of them are from Guatemala. Though I couldn\u2019t place Guatemala on a map,\
  \ I still felt worldly.\n\nWhen Misty\u2019s 15-year-old sister made local headlines\
  \ for running away, it was to Guatemala she was bound. These are the stories less\
  \ heard, of the homesick teenager who wants to return to a place where she knows\
  \ the language and culture and fits in with her friends. I remember being confused:\
  \ Why would you want to go back there, to that place so many people run away from?\n\
  \nAnd now here I am. And it is beautiful.\n\nBack in Georgia, Misty seemed like\
  \ a cute little name for a cute little girl, albeit incongruous with the landscape.\
  \ Georgia is steamy and humid and alive with airborne water, but never does it manifest\
  \ as mist. Nothing that cool, that delicate, that evocative.\n\nBut when I woke\
  \ up this morning in Antigua, I awoke to a vibrant city hushed by mist and shrouded\
  \ mountains in the distance.\n\nI never knew the status of Misty\u2019s family\u2019\
  s paperwork\u2014we didn\u2019t ask that sort of thing. But I did know that she\
  \ was a citizen born in the United States, and her sister wasn\u2019t. And as I\
  \ taxied on the runway in Guatemala City, I imagined her parents dreaming of their\
  \ homeland as they held their baby girl and decided what to call her. Knowing she\
  \ might never see Guatemala, they decided to put a little piece of it into her name\
  \ so that she would never have to run away to feel connected to her lineage.\n\n\
  Misty is 16 now, the same age that I was when we met. I have no idea where she is\
  \ or what she\u2019s up to, but I think of her every time I look at these mountains,\
  \ and I hope she can return here freely one day to see the beauty of her familial\
  \ home. I hope she can come and go freely, slipping in and out of the two cultures\
  \ she can rightfully own if she so chooses. I hope that she sees mist."
