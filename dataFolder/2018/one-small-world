Text: "The day after my final master\u2019s jury I was sitting under the roof with\
  \ mixed emotions. Called my mom to tell that I was going to the Himalayas, she hung\
  \ up the phone yelling how I could take such a big decision. So immediately called\
  \ her up to apologise and made a new story of reaching home in 10 days.\nThen I\
  \ booked a ticket to Delhi. Next day went to railway station to find, I had missed\
  \ the train, I felt as if it was my last chance to go to Spiti or to live. So ended\
  \ up boarding the next train without tickets. From Delhi after three days on road\
  \ met some random guys. Instead of taking my way I went with them to Chitkul and\
  \ stayed in their tents by the riverside. Waking up I found there was no direct\
  \ bus to Spiti, I almost thought I had to go back, but hitchhiked till Nako. But\
  \ Spiti was far ahead, and the bus was supposed to have left half n hour before\
  \ I had reached. Still, went to bus stand, fortunately, the bus was delayed, met\
  \ few travellers and got down in Tabo. Tabo seemed dull until I found an old monastery\
  \ hiding behind the new face. Falling in love with it I spent so much time that\
  \ I again missed a bus to Spiti. \nGiving up after few hours we started walking,\
  \ on the other end of Tabo we got some vehicles. After reaching Kaza again similar\
  \ fate hit us, we didn't find any means to go to Key monastery. This time some taxi\
  \ driver dropped us for free, telling us to get down before village. Once he dropped\
  \ us near the trekking trail of key monastery there was no limits for our happiness.\
  \ \nThe two others climbed the mountain pretty fast and the trail got steeper hence\
  \ they were invisible. I dint loose hopes by that. Suddenly I felt like I can\u2019\
  t take a step further out of exhaustion and if I had slipped I would be gone. It\
  \ took all courage to put the next step. That feeling found its way back after a\
  \ while and this time tears started rolling down my cheeks and I thought it\u2019\
  s the end of my life. Unknowingly voice dint reach lips, but I stood there like\
  \ a rock against the cold winds being not able to think of taking one more step.\
  \ As time passed I felt like hours, on the other side since my fellow travellers'\
  \ dint see me for 10 minutes they came back looking for me and helped. When I reached\
  \ the monastery the view made me feel as if nothing had happened. Stayed there for\
  \ a night gazing at stars.\nNext day, on the way back, an old lama started speaking\
  \ in my language and said he studied in my city, with goosebumps I returned back."
