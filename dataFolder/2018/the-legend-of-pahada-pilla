Text: "What first caught my attention was his messy mop of hair. It seemed to flow\
  \ with the breeze as he bounded effortlessly towards base camp. I, however, trudged\
  \ along, feeling the effects of the altitude and my seven-kilogram pack. Utterly\
  \ unprepared for this multi-day hike, alone and in a foreign country, I was determined\
  \ to complete it. The moment he turned around, everything changed. Those eyes of\
  \ his, one blue, the other brown, locked onto mine. Immediately convinced he knew\
  \ all the secrets to a happy life, I was further drawn in by his warm greeting.\
  \ Conspicuously eyeing my attire, it was impossible for him to contain his laughter.\
  \ There we were, hiking in temperatures barely above freezing in the mountains of\
  \ Nepal and I was wearing a pair of toe shoes. My new hiking companion was one of\
  \ few words. As a minimalist, he had only the necessities. He showed me the best\
  \ paths to follow, his favourite shrubs, the best streams and was wonderful, welcomed\
  \ company. \n\nAfter arriving at base camp and settling in for the night, we arranged\
  \ to meet early the next morning. I felt confident he would know the best spots\
  \ for watching the sunrise. Sure enough, when I emerged from the hostel, he was\
  \ already there. As the sun rose and cameras clicked, our breath was taken away.\n\
  \nThe descent was remarkably easier; covering in one hour what had taken us nearly\
  \ three the day before. The moment we parted ways was bittersweet. As he gently\
  \ kissed my tears away, once again I found myself utterly unprepared and alone in\
  \ the mountains. He had shown me his heart and shared with me his secrets to happiness:\
  \ live simply, give openly, accept graciously and never forget to stop and smell\
  \ the flowers along the way. \n\nFeeling lost without having caught his name, I\
  \ asked the owner of the next teahouse. Short, slender, fit and spry, her jet black\
  \ hair was knotted into a bun. She was well into her sixties and grew up in these\
  \ mountains. Surely she would know him. Lighting up with laughter when I showed\
  \ her our photos, she sighed \u201CAh! Him! I don\u2019t think he has a real name.\
  \ Doesn\u2019t seem to have a home either but I let him sleep inside. Everyone feeds\
  \ him and takes care of him too. Did you meet him? You like him, yes? I think he\u2019\
  s a good very good boy.\u201D And then, with a twinkle in her eye, I finally received\
  \ the answer I so desperately sought. \u201CYou want to know what I call him? Pah\u0101\
  da Pill\u0101. That's Nepali for Mountain Puppy.\u201D"
