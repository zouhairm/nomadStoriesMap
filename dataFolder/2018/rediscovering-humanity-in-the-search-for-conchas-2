Text: "As the 27th person climbed into our outdated fishing boat and the river water\
  \ threatened to spill over and drown us all, I looked around to see if anyone else\
  \ seemed concerned with our potential river bottom fate.\n\nMy eyes were met with\
  \ nothing but smiles and laughter. The women and girls of the afro-ecuadorian town\
  \ of Santa Rosa, located in the Esmeraldas province in Ecuador, do this daily. We\
  \ were off to gather \u201Cconchas,\u201D or freshwater mollusks.\n\nThe process\
  \ involves weaving through the intricate maze of mangrove roots in thigh deep mud\
  \ to locate the hidden shelled creatures. On average, they collect 300 to 500 conchas\
  \ per day, which requires several hours of work. Ten mollusks sell for one U.S.\
  \ dollar.\n\nDespite its small monetary payoff, this process has become a cultural\
  \ and familial tradition. They make sure to leave the small mollusks behind so their\
  \ children and grandchildren can continue their work.\n\nAs someone who lives in\
  \ northern Minnesota, only a couple hours from the Canadian border, the heat and\
  \ humidity of the region were starting to get to me as we slowly crossed the river.\
  \ As our boat was not in the best shape, the smell of gasoline permeated the air.\n\
  \nBy the time we reached the shore, I was dizzy and nauseous. Determined to continue,\
  \ I marched on in the footsteps of the local women to the beach. Unable to stand\
  \ without waves of nausea, I sat on a piece of driftwood and began to dig into the\
  \ sand.\n\nI lagged behind the rest of the group, moving from driftwood to driftwood,\
  \ until finally, sweating and on the verge of losing my lunch, I let them go on\
  \ without me and rested on the wet sand.\n\nImmediately after noticing my absence,\
  \ two of the women, Mar\xEDa and Yaris, came to the rescue. In their accented coastal\
  \ Spanish, they asked what was wrong, scooped me up, and practically carried me\
  \ down the beach to the coconut trees.\n\nThere, they gently sat me down and ordered\
  \ the only man in the group to fetch me a \u201Cpipa.\u201D I was presented with\
  \ a green coconut almost the size of my head, the top cut off with machete. Mar\xED\
  a told me the water inside would cure me.\n\nI brought the coconut to my mouth and\
  \ let the cool, sweet water trickle down my throat while Mar\xEDa sat beside me\
  \ stroking my back. The sick feeling began to fade.\n\nI was struck by the generous,\
  \ caring, and joyful way these women live their lives. Though, in terms of material\
  \ things, I had much more than they had, they did not hesitate to help a stranger\
  \ in need.\n\nWe are all human after all."
