Text: "I need to wring my brain of every thought other than grinding my feet into\
  \ the pedals, but the slosh of a half empty water bottle between my legs continues\
  \ to break my focus. As my cycling partner and I swim across this endless Saharan\
  \ ocean, thirst repeats like a mantra in my mind. I\u2019m so thirsty. I\u2019m\
  \ thirsty. Thirst. Dry. The moment we realized we were lost, we cut ourselves off\
  \ save for one sip of water at each passing mile. Not drinks. Tiny, delicate sips.\
  \ The act of swallowing the drops of tea water has no satisfaction, but I find slight\
  \ relief in swirling it with my tongue to savor the wetness. Our supply dwindles\
  \ with each hour, a trickling hourglass in this sea of sand. We have no idea if\
  \ we will find help at El Gouera, the nomadic village we hope we are directing ourselves\
  \ toward. All we are certain of is that no one is coming to rescue us. No one knows\
  \ where we are. It is the closest to death I have ever faced and the fear is black,\
  \ but faintly tantalizing.\nWe break for lunch; a few crackers with tomato paste\
  \ and peanuts. What had been a white mosaic of cracked dirt bleached by the sun\
  \ has melted into shifting sand, impossible to cycle through. I take a handful and\
  \ clench it in my fist, but no matter how hard I squeeze, it slips out the bottom\
  \ of my palm in a constant, calm release. With a face of sandpaper, lips splitting\
  \ apart like a poorly glued paper m\xE2ch\xE9, and matted hair clinging to my neck,\
  \ I envision the red lipped, sun-dressed social butterfly I once was. Guilt bubbles\
  \ in my throat at the seriousness of it all. \nWhy have I done this to myself?\n\
  But I know the answer even as I ask it. Even engulfed by fear and thirst, it\u2019\
  s impossible to ignore the beauty in our isolation. Sand sweeps high and low in\
  \ lazy waves. The wind cuts the tips of the dunes sharply and ripples the sand.\
  \ From afar, she is a smooth, tanned back but when looked at closely you can see\
  \ her epidermis texture. \nI throw another fistful into the air. It dances for a\
  \ moment, slipping into a thin piece of silk before realizing the dangers and falling\
  \ back into its larger body once more. To live on the road is to grasp the essentiality\
  \ of discovery. The pain, suffering, and ugly compliment the ecstasy, joy and beauty\
  \ in this complex planet we inhabit. There is not one without the other. And to\
  \ travel is to seek out with hungry fervor the naked truths the world is willing\
  \ to reveal to me. This is the why I put myself in life threatening positions. This\
  \ is why I must risk it all."
