Text: "I was born in Somalia in 1987. Moved to Kenya in 1992 as a refugee. Resettled\
  \ in New Zealand in 2004. Graduated with a BA in 2010 and moved to Melbourne. Worked\
  \ for awhile as a social worker and gain a scholarship to study in EU in 2016. Travelled\
  \ a little bit in EU while I was studying. I love traveling and learning about different\
  \ cultures and deconstructing my culture. I have always had a dream to write a book\
  \ but I even have the folder on my laptop. I just don\u2019t know how to get around\
  \ that and since life happened, I never have time to explore that side of it. This\
  \ would give me an opportunity to explore that. I write a lot - but I write for\
  \ emotional therapy and I really don\u2019t know whether I am a good story teller\
  \ or not. I shared once my work and the response was good but I am too scared to\
  \ share because I just feel it\u2019s too personal and maybe people will judge me.\
  \ As the years went by - I worked a lot on my shake factor which was conditioned\
  \ into me due to my cultural background. I feel like I am in a good place to be\
  \ authentic and myself. I also think this opportunity will help me navigate these\
  \ things. Every time I speak to people, it\u2019s like I am healing them, I can\
  \ access their emotions and provide them with platforms where they do not feel judge.\
  \ I want to leave that behind me as my legacy when my time is up and I feel like\
  \ literature will allow me to do that. \n\nThanks"
