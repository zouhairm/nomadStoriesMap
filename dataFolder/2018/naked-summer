Text: "I found a summer work in Nanjing.\nDoubts rushed between \u201CI want to be\
  \ at home\u201D and \u201CI want to travel\u201D.My doubts prompted fear, and then\
  \ fear turned into anxiety, then anxiety, believing that stress makes it growing\
  \ stout in the mirror, disguised itself as unwillingness. \nAt last, the orange\
  \ suitcase fell out onto the conveyor, so here i am.\n- Hello! Are you a Sayat?\
  \ I heard a female voice. She was a HR agent.\nThe rhythm of life the cooks lived\
  \ during the working hours swept everything in its path. Melodies of hissing pans\
  \ and shouts from all directions WHEREISTHATF*DUCK!?Later one of the comments came\
  \ on my head HOWDAREYOU, STUPID,TOPOURTHE COCONUTMILKONTHEOYSTERS!It was my favorite\
  \ chef in the kitchen. Slightly overweight Chief Ming. In free time, he often laughed\
  \ and kindly joked at me, told vulgar stories and was the first real teacher. Only\
  \ thanks to him, I learned how love cooking in general. However, Chief Ming taught\
  \ the most important lesson in July. According to ridiculous circumstances, if to\
  \ be more precisely, by sympathy for me coming from one elderly lady-client, I got\
  \ an expensive bottle of red wine as a tip. I showed it to the chief, he smiled\
  \ maliciously and said that tonight we would have plans. Frankly, at that moment\
  \ it seemed to me to love wine means to drink it in a right way: a good outfit,\
  \ a good restaurant and everything in that spirit.\nHowever, I was deeply wrong...\n\
  The evening has come and having sat down in the chief\u2019s car, we have gone to\
  \ other end of city. In Nanjing  I gradually became imbued with a new feeling for\
  \ me. Feeling of happy loneliness.Loneliness warmed and generated only a tangible\
  \ sense of freedom.\nThe car stopped at a small filthy Uigur dirty tavern.I felt\
  \ not comfortable. But We laughed and poured expensive wine into plastic cups, and\
  \ drank it after spicy shish kebabs. Of course, it was terribly still, and it was\
  \ extremely funny. \nWhat was the lesson he taught me? What was important in those\
  \ three hours spent at a dirty table?\nThe moment when I stood on the edge. Does\
  \ it happen every day?! In Nanjing, I brought many new impressions, images and people\
  \ to my memory. My world has become wider. I always stand on the edge of the world\
  \ I am familiar with, but every day it becomes a bit wider. Quite a bit and this\
  \ allows me to take a small step forward and again get up on the edge. This is life;\
  \ we are always on the edge. On the edge of discovery, love, sadness, new acquaintances,\
  \ just about anything!"
