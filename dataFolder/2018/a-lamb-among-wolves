Text: "\u201CWe stop\u201D\nThe truck driver looked at the red numbers above his head\
  \ and gave me a smiling nod. I tried to respond the same way, but my face muscles\
  \ hardly moved after a soggy nap.\nI glanced at the driver \u2013 with his eyes\
  \ fixed on the road, he was humming the same unfamiliar song as before. Only the\
  \ scenery outside had changed since I closed my eyes \u2013 tree-covered slopes\
  \ turned into a flat countryside, dotted with shabby structures.\nNot long after\
  \ we slowed down and drove into a large parking space, surrounded by eerie one-story\
  \ buildings. I felt my senses waking up after a drowsy day for the evening dusk\
  \ was already falling. My uneasiness grew with every disappearing red sunbeam; this\
  \ shady place was to be my campsite.\nWhen the sun was still at its highest point,\
  \ I was stuck in a gas station near the border, trying to hitch a ride to Czechia.\
  \ When I saw yet another truck roll into the station after hours of talking to unwilling\
  \ drivers in the heat, I decided I would go anywhere the road would take me. After\
  \ a reluctant conversation, I shook hands with Bogdan and was heading to Slovakia\
  \ in an air-conditioned cabin.\n\u201CSlovakia \u2013 sleep, morning \u2013 Hungary.\u201D\
  \ Sure!\nWe parked next to a dozen other trucks and my chauffeur pointed towards\
  \ a tiny green spot in the middle of the lot. I replied with as much enthusiasm\
  \ as I could manage. Sleeping in a tent surrounded by truck drivers wasn\u2019t\
  \ the most venturesome thing I ever did, yet it wasn\u2019t the most appealing one\
  \ either. However much boldness I thought I had, it didn\u2019t stop my anxiety\
  \ from popping in to remind that I was still a 20-year-old gal.\nI took my backpack\
  \ and walked past the men who seemed to be as surprised by my presence as I felt\
  \ uncomfortable in theirs. I approached the square of lawn only to find out that\
  \ it was already occupied. Two pairs of eyes were watching me with no less confusion\
  \ than the others.\nTwo small sheep broke the awkward silence and went back to their\
  \ initial activity of nibbling on scarce tussocks of grass. Well, this could have\
  \ been worse. Discretely as I could, I picked the cleanest spot and got to business.\n\
  Sitting at the entrance of my tiny tent I looked at the sleeping neighbours. Even\
  \ the human ones were retreating to their cabins and soon silence befell on the\
  \ island of lambs.\nA lamb among wolves, that\u2019s what I thought of myself. Yet\
  \ the wolves lived in my mind and the only lambs were those outside. I fell asleep\
  \ clutching my pocket knife, leaving my inner frightful sheep outside."
