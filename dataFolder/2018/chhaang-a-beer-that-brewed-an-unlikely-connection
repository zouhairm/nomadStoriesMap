Text: "Taking a breather after a tour of the Stok Palace Museum, I was surveying the\
  \ vast expanse of the Ladakh valley while popping steaming momos at the outdoor\
  \ cafeteria. Just then the server came over and asked if my food was ok. We got\
  \ talking and I learnt about Chhaang \u2013 a locally brewed beer. With a spiked\
  \ curiosity I ventured deep into the village in search of Chhaang and stopped at\
  \ a general store to enquire about it. Leaving her shop unattended, the kind shopkeeper\
  \ walked me to the next door house requesting for Chhaang. Though the family knew\
  \ her, they were reluctant in letting me in. Realizing the issue, I poked my head\
  \ through the half-opened gate and requested to oblige me with their brew. Perseverance\
  \ paid off and the grandma of the house nodded and allowed me in.\nAs I sat there\
  \ in their front yard surrounded by their livestock; the younger son poured me a\
  \ mug straight out of the bucket. There I was sitting in a Ladakhi home, drinking\
  \ Ladakhi beer with a Ladakhi family who till 10 minutes ago were unknown to me.\
  \ In that moment, I could\u2019ve been Ian Wright.\nI neither wanted to overstay\
  \ their welcome nor wanted to tempt myself with the third helping of Chhaang; hence,\
  \ I chugged my second drink and after clicking a few pictures of the kids and noting\
  \ their address with a promise of mailing them the copies as a token of appreciation,\
  \ I headed back to my hotel 10km away in Leh.\nA month later when I developed the\
  \ photos back home in Mumbai after my 5300km road trip, I wasn\u2019t sure if any\
  \ courier service would reliably deliver it to the tiny hamlet of Stok. They stayed\
  \ in my drawer for 2 years till I revisited Leh in \u201815. I tried to go back\
  \ to the house but lost my way in the village. Thence, I reached Stok Palace Museum\
  \ and showed the photos to the museum keeper and enquired if she knew where they\
  \ lived. Her eyes lit up; from the top storey of the palace she pointed out the\
  \ house and guided me to the correct route. This time around, the man of the house\
  \ answered the knock and though he was a bit hesitant initially, when he saw his\
  \ kids\u2019 photos, he quickly welcomed me in. And this time, instead of the front\
  \ yard, I was invited to their living room. Unfortunately, the Chhaang was over\
  \ but I was treated to their delicious Butter Tea while the family gathered around\
  \ and gleefully saw their photos. After my cuppa and a few clicks later I left with\
  \ a promise that I\u2019ll return with their photos once again in a few years\u2019\
  \ time. Perhaps, for another beverage."
