Text: "I met T-man while sitting at yet another beach bar. My crew were devouring\
  \ gourmet hamburgers and I was stealing their french fries and staring at the sea.\
  \ The narrow beach ran up from the water to the base of a short wall, on top of\
  \ which sat the street level cafe, open on all sides. A small boy, six or seven,\
  \ jumped around on the sand below, bare feet and skinny legs, dark blue shorts,\
  \ light blue button up shirt. His school uniform. He buzzed up to a couple on lounge\
  \ chairs and did some cartwheels, seeking attention.\n\"Isn't your father looking\
  \ for you?\" asked the man, more interested in his food and his companion. The boy\
  \ scampered back to his own play and met my eyes. I smiled at him. He bounced his\
  \ way closer and continued his games on the wall. He hoisted himself onto straight\
  \ arms and hand-walked back and forth on the ledge, glancing my way. I smiled again,\
  \ encouraging him.\n\"I walkin' on my hands!\" he said.\n\"I see that!\" I laughed.\
  \ \"A little monkey.\" And he plopped back down to the sand and thumped his chest\
  \ like a gorilla, giggling. \nAway and back, this time he hopped up on the wall\
  \ into the sandy dining room, flexing his scrawny muscles, leaping down to the beach,\
  \ full of uncontainable energy. He pounded his chest, flung open his school shirt\
  \ and ran circles holding it open like a cape. \"I Superman!\" he was saying when\
  \ suddenly, mid-stride, he glanced towards the bar and stopped. The chef stood outside\
  \ the kitchen door, a tall, thick man with a backwards hat and a white apron. He\
  \ called out to the kid.\n\"Your Mamma waitin' for you,\" his voice was soft but\
  \ formidable, his eyebrows stern and lowered. The boy rushed over to his shoes,\
  \ fumbling with the buttons on his shirt. He glanced back at the chef, who stood\
  \ watching him, arms crossed on his round belly.\n\"I heard you!\" he whispered,\
  \ respect and fear in his timid voice. I had heard about physical discipline in\
  \ Caribbean cultures. I felt sad for the boy, but amazed at the same time, watching\
  \ his transformation from pure ball of energy to intense focus as he pulled on his\
  \ socks and worked at his shoe strings. Once he'd gotten control of the laces, though,\
  \ he glanced back my way and smirked. I smiled back. He trotted up to the chef,\
  \ who placed a gentle hand on the back of his head and walked him to the entrance.\
  \ As they waited, the boy peeked shyly up at his father, who almost smiled back,\
  \ but instead leaned down and spoke sternly, quietly. I sighed. I hoped I hadn't\
  \ caused trouble."
