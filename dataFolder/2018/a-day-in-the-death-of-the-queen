Text: "The last thing I expected while on holiday from America was to bear witness\
  \ to the solemn island pageantry of the Queen Mother\u2019s funeral.  Tonga\u2019\
  s capitol city, Nuku Alofa, was awash in purple and black bunting as schoolgirls\
  \ in pigtails marched to the royal cemetery where the dignitaries were gathering,\
  \ many wearing their thatched tuvalas, or grass skirts. \n\nA few days earlier,\
  \ I had hopped up from Aukland to round out my New Zealand trip with a visit to\
  \ see old friends who were running the Peace Corps on the islands.  Just prior to\
  \ my arrival, the octogenarian queen had died and her funeral coincided with my\
  \ short stay.\n\nVery faintly at first, the sad refrain of the military band\u2019\
  s dirge could be heard accompanying the walking procession of the Queen\u2019s catafalque.\
  \  The cemetery began to fill with Tongan military officials, police officers in\
  \ their dress uniforms, foreign delegations, and everyday Tongans wanting to say\
  \ goodbye to their queen mother.  At long last, the casket, draped in the Tongan\
  \ flag and held aloft by dozens of royal pallbearers, entered the compound.  \n\n\
  Dressed as I was in a tee shirt and cargo shorts, I watched and listened from a\
  \ respectful distance.  Then, a matronly hostess noticed my awkward ogling through\
  \ the chainlink fence.  \"You are welcomed to attend the funeral, but you may want\
  \ to change into more appropriate clothes,\" she said in a kindly and forgiving\
  \ manner.   I nearly ran back to my friends\u2019 nearby house to borrow a black\
  \ sarong and black polo shirt and returned to take a seat in the back row.\n\nIt\
  \ made little difference that I could not understand the prayers or hymns offered\
  \ up in the Her Majesty\u2019s name.  I was, for a moment, a local \u2014 sharing\
  \ in the respect and sense of loss for a departed monarch whose good deeds, while\
  \ unknown to me, had garnered the Queen Mother the profound affection and loyalty\
  \ of her subjects.  Moments like these are why we travel."
