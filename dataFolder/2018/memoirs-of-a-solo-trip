Text: "\u201CGo to cities that light a spark in your heart, a place where you find\
  \ your lost soul, that\u2019s where you are meant to weave your story.\u201D I was\
  \ taking a flight to Paris via Istanbul heartbroken. Yes, I was disappointed and\
  \ heartbroken. No, I wasn't coming out of a relationship, I was a victim of unrequited\
  \ love but that wasn't a problem because I was capable of burying my feelings and\
  \ moving on. All I knew that the trip was going to help me relax and what\u2019\
  s better than breathing in Europe for a while? Paris, France, There is something\
  \ about airplanes that I love the most, the feeling of having left somewhere and\
  \ not arriving anywhere. My first night in Paris, how could I spend it sitting in\
  \ an apartment? I shared a love-hate relationship with Paris, as funny as it may\
  \ sound. I may not be able to justify the beauty of Paris in words. The city artistically\
  \ designed with lights that enhance its historic architecture. It\u2019s hard not\
  \ to fall in love with the city so I did fall for it or maybe because someone made\
  \ me fall for it. My first sight of the Eiffel tower, I found a friend, a companion,\
  \ a man who talked me out of my home sickness. The picnic at \u2018Champs de mars\u2019\
  \ was ticked off my bucket list with him taking pictures of me and me sipping on\
  \ a classic wine. With the illumination of the Eiffel tower I felt like my life\
  \ couldn't get any better. The street lights highlighting the city also make it\
  \ a perfect location of your worst nightmare. I was mugged, not once but thrice.\
  \ Who has the time to even think about romance in such an intense situation? My\
  \ friend and I were on our way to board a train to Bordeaux from Paris. Travelling\
  \ cheap is difficult, especially in Paris. We had three suitcases and no motivation\
  \ to spend on a taxi, so we decided to take a train. The underground Parisian metro\
  \ is well connected and linked to multiple stations. Now, that was troublesome,\
  \ changing trains, hopping between stations with three suitcases. A man had stalked\
  \ us all way and came up to us disguised as a helper. How I wish I had known then\
  \ that he was there with a knife. Thank God for the train that arrived and with\
  \ a few people that walked on us, the man took a step back and left. My heart was\
  \ about to explode. This was one of the most scariest incident amongst the three\
  \ and this experience changed my life. In that heavy moment the first person that\
  \ crossed my mind was my mum. \u2018Fear and Paris brought out the best in me, my\
  \ unconditional love for my mother.\u2019 Lesson learned."
