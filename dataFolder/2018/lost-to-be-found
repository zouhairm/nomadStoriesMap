Text: 'Born in the middle-class Indian family had its perks and loss. We grew up learning
  to be satisfied with whatever we have, or perhaps whatever was destined in our lives
  by the ultimate Almighty. Reusing the clothes worn by our elder siblings or sharing
  the room; almost everything. As a child, I followed the rule-book of society and
  kept my thoughts shut up in the dark corner of my mind. I tried to fit in the container
  that, which as a child I didn''t realise, was limiting me and narrowing my perceive.
  It was a happy land, the happiness defined in the dictionary of the society, and
  I had a smile, crooked smile. The textbooks taught me about the wars our ancestors
  fought, the science behind the formation of the rainbow and how the people build
  the culture of any region.


  But, it failed in many ways. Later, I found a new teacher - Traveling. That was
  the moment, a decision, that pushed me to the edge. The girl who was in the shelters
  and confinement had now opened her wings to explore the world that was beyond her
  vision. The girl that was lost in the systematic and the organized world found the
  randomness in travelling, kaleidoscopic perspective of the world. I realised that
  there was more to the materialistic and objective world - I found myself.


  Solo travelling helped me to increase self-confidence and trust. I finally understood
  the true meaning of a independent woman.'
