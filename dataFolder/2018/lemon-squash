Text: "Lemon Squash? I can still hear the sound of her voice, inquisitive, delightfully\
  \ low pitched and thick with her native Fijian twist in tongue. The interrogative\
  \ marked well by the way the \u2018a\u2019 was lengthily pronounced.\nWe were due\
  \ to wait another 6 hours for our flight to Samoa and the Nadi airport wasn\u2019\
  t providing much excitement. \n\nBoredom had quickly overcome us and we opted to\
  \ celebrate our upcoming trip with a freshly bought duty free gin and tonic to accompany\
  \ and elevate it to what is so simply and aptly named, the gin & tonic. Served in\
  \ plastic cups, the draught definitely lifted our spirits and made us feel like\
  \ kings seated in our crumbling fake leather seats. As we were living our gin reverie,\
  \ three Fijians dressed in airport security uniforms turned towards us, attracted\
  \ by our \u2018glow\u2019 and the fizzy lemony smell. \n\u2018Lemon Squash?\u2019\
  \ one of them had asked turning to us.\n No it wasn\u2019t lemon squash but that\
  \ didn\u2019t seem to phase our newly found friends. Being half French I couldn\u2019\
  t refuse any drink to anyone as it wouldn\u2019t be decent otherwise. The smiles\
  \ and inquisitiveness were so genuine that it was impossible not to be drawn by\
  \ them.\nMy grandfather use to always say that the best way to make new friends\
  \ is to sit down and pass on the drinks one has to share. \nConversation came naturally\
  \ as the sound of our cups thudded together. We told of our stories traveling around\
  \ the world for a few months and were told of theirs. They were almost done with\
  \ their shift and were waiting for the last Japan Airlines flight to touch ground\
  \ after a 3-hour delay. Feasting on wasabi-flavoured crackers we all munched away\
  \ listening and inquiring as the occasional crisp and cracking sound would punctuate\
  \ our friendly chat. We decided to ask them for a recommendation for our return\
  \ trip as we were due to stop in Nadi for 48 hours. \n\u2018You can come to our\
  \ village, it\u2019s only 15 minutes away, I\u2019d be happy to invite you to my\
  \ house\u2019. We exchanged phone numbers. The lady in front of me, Assela, even\
  \ said that she would wait for us at 2am on our arrival as her shift finished at\
  \ midnight anyway. It was too good to be true and yet it happened. Assela and her\
  \ family took care of us for two days, introducing us to her Fijian way of life\
  \ and culture and treating us like real guests of honour where really we were just\
  \ two scrubby backpackers who had only by chance, discovered another side of the\
  \ Fiji, not the postcard version, the real one."
