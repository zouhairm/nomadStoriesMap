Text: "\u201CGirls, it\u2019s raining\u201D I kind of whisper like it was the biggest\
  \ shocking affair in the world stretching my neck towards the airplane\u2019s porthole.\
  \ The greyest sky I have ever seen. On the 31st of July, Ethiopia, Africa.\nWhat\
  \ about my sandy-sunny expectations?\nThis should have been the first hint that\
  \ this travel would have been a continuous series of surprises.\nMy friends and\
  \ I are going to the religious mission in Adwa, a small city in the north of Ethiopia\
  \ where we\u2019ll be volunteering for local children. We leave Addis Ababa airport\
  \ to fly to Axum, then we reach the town on a too-well-equipped minivan. The way\
  \ forward is a tight street without edges. Ethiopian music on the background and\
  \ over the window car huge, rounded and so green mountains rising from the ground.\n\
  Eis, the autist, tells us about the hyenas living up there.\nI expected a spare,\
  \ sandy landscape with elephant and giraffes.\nWhat a fool!\nThe Equator is a stone's\
  \ throw away from us: here the green is explosive!\nMoreover it\u2019s the rainy\
  \ season: the best moment to see the harvest flourish.\nCows, donkeys, goats walk\
  \ along the street brought by different aged people, even 6 years old children.\
  \ No pigs, as Ethiophia is a Christian ortodox nation with growing muslim communities\
  \ and for both pork meat is forbidden.\nLeaving behind the fairy atmosphere given\
  \ by the countryside we get in the urban center. Here the only street seen for km\
  \ branches off in many side streets. These are not made by asphalt but by clear\
  \ elegant hazel stones (though is one of the most poor city I\u2019ve ever seen).\
  \ \nThe nose gets caught by a pervading smell of berber\xE8, the most used typical\
  \ spice. Hibiscus tree, small shops and building sites nearby the street. Almost\
  \ all the workers ar surprisingly women. \u201CLook at the scaffolding: they are\
  \ made of stuck-stitch!\u201D, I say to a friend.\nMeanwhile pedestrians walk all\
  \ around. The street belongs to them. There are no cars, only small blue taxi with\
  \ three wheels that reminds me of the typical thai \u201CTuk-tuk\u201D. I soon understand\
  \ that the car horn is essential here as it takes the place of turn-signals! This\
  \ makes me amused but now I realize I\u2019m far from home and my comfort zone.\n\
  Still raining. Someone never minds and continues with his activities. Children instead\
  \ start running by the women who open the front doors to welcome them. Everyone\
  \ is children of everyone. Hospitality is the most important value. There is room\
  \ for everyone, even for me."
