Text: "Night. The only source of warmth that kept me from shivering was a campfire.\
  \ Even though it was August, nights in Sharyn Canyon in Kazakhstan are surprisingly\
  \ hostile. It was so miserable to cross over 200 km in a hot and stuffy bus from\
  \ Almaty, expecting to admire the view of the canyon during a moonlight, observe\
  \ a meteor shower and hear the sound of Kazakh wilderness, but instead, we had nothing\
  \ except for the campfire. Too dark to see any cliffs, no meteor showers, we were\
  \ supposed to drive back to Almaty with a tourist group at the same night. But,\
  \ fortunately, an idea came to my mind.\n\u201CWhat if instead of going back to\
  \ Almaty we spend the night here and see the canyon during a day?\u201D I asked\
  \ my friend. We intentionally came here to see the well-known rocky cliffs of Sharyn\
  \ canyon. Though we had neither a tent nor sleeping bags we decided to stay, even\
  \ without a means of transportation back to Almaty. \nEventually, we stayed alone\
  \ in the canyon having no idea where to spend the night. However, we encountered\
  \ an outdoor resort where we found an empty yurt (round nomad tent). We met no one\
  \ in the resort and we snuck in. The yurt was comfortable with cushions and elegant\
  \ carpets, but having no blankets to take over, I expected a freezing night; however,\
  \ the idea that we were in stranger\u2019s house kept me up with worry. I was afraid\
  \ that the owner of the resort could find us overnighting without a permission and\
  \ therefore fine us. I could not fall asleep. \nWe set off early. After a night\
  \ of shivering and fear, the only thing that I was dreaming of was sleep. Since\
  \ we had almost no water left and were sweaty due to a rising temperature and physical\
  \ activity, the way to summit the rocky peak was the most challenging. With every\
  \ step, my shoe was filled with sand and due to poor friction, I was constantly\
  \ sliding down. Combined with my drowsiness and thirst, I cursed the idea of being\
  \ here. I wanted to surrender, but my inner voice insisted on struggling to overcome\
  \ hardship.\nWhen we finally summited, we sat on stones next to a cliff being literally\
  \ on the edge of a precipice, admiring the fascinating view of a sunrise. We saw\
  \ all the beauty of canyon that was hidden during a night tour \u2013 a steep contrast\
  \ between a blue sky and orange rocky peaks, miles of untouched landscape. Soon\
  \ after as we wandered back and put our hands out to hitchhike, I realized it was\
  \ the first true sunrise I\u2019d seen with no skyscrapers blocking the sun."
