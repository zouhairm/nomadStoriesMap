Text: "'God Bless America' it says on the smoke stack on the side of the road. \n\
  I\u2019m not sure why everything here is on fire. \n\nEventually I arrive at my\
  \ destination after twenty hours riding through the cornfields of Indiana and exchanging\
  \ hello's with a somewhat technologically advanced Amish community.\n\nChicago -\
  \ The Brick City. Another place that once caught fire and has since been replaced\
  \ with red brick apartments that you weave between on the L train. For my second\
  \ visit here I make my way through Union Station. This building is triumphant and\
  \ cosy. I am at first confronted by the tall ceilings and golden railings, but then\
  \ I feel myself comforted by the sense that this building desires to keep you hidden\
  \ away from the untrained symphony of horns and sirens that fill your ears as your\
  \ feet reach the pavement.\n\nI wait on an unknown corner for my tour guide to pick\
  \ me up. We met in a fast food line in Detroit. He finds me with relative ease which\
  \ is the sign of a true local. The sole location of this tour is his community.\
  \ As we drive, we make comparisons. In my community there\u2019s a little Vietnamese\
  \ shop. In his community it\u2019s world renowned pizza. \n\nIn the centre of the\
  \ road is a grass island. Where I come from this patch of well-kept greenery marks\
  \ the entrance to the \u201CGarden City\u201D, designed to greet visitors and distract\
  \ them from the concrete and rubble that otherwise defines my hometown. Sometimes\
  \ as kids we would run across the island if the traffic light felt too far away.\
  \ On this day in Chicago the grass looks just as beautiful, just as tempting to\
  \ flit across. I\u2019m told it\u2019s not unusual to see young folk here either,\
  \ they are probably holding guns. Each turn we make there is another patch of grass\
  \ that separates one gang from another. I still can\u2019t help but translate his\
  \ story into my own place. I imagine myself dodging bullets as we take a short cut\
  \ for ice creams. \n\nMy tour is an honest tour. An internet search tells me about\
  \ the gun violence that holds Chicago captive. Instead his honesty leads us to the\
  \ good stories. Always tell the good stories he reminds me, our hope lies in those.\
  \ The good stories need time to soak in, so this part of the tour is on foot. I\u2019\
  m introduced to a Pastor who was once an addict, and a health centre that was once\
  \ a factory. Three hours of good stories that you can\u2019t find online. Back home\
  \ a lot of people don\u2019t believe in the possibility of transformation. Face\
  \ to face with Chicago, the brick city \u2013 I have to."
