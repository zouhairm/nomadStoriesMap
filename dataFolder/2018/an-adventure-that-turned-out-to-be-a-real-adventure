Text: "It all started on a Friday, when my and two friends decided to have a little\
  \ adventurous day trip. We arrived to San Cipriano by driving less than two hours,\
  \ just before arriving to the city of Buenaventura and local people received us\
  \ very kind and full of joy. The first thing we did was leave the car and jump into\
  \ the famous \u201Cbrujitas\u201D, a very handmade way of transportation made of\
  \ wood and a motorcycle that went by an old train rail. We sat on the benches, grabbed\
  \ each other and started the journey. After several hundred meters crossing a very\
  \ dark tunnel we arrived to a new world, kind of magical, with huge leaves, trees\
  \ and all kind of big insects. We continued riding our \u201Cbrujitas\u201D for\
  \ 20 minutes until we arrived to this beautiful place. It is a small community where\
  \ the fun is to take big lifesavers and float in the currents of the river.  It\
  \ was wonderful during the day. Then it came the time to go back and that is when\
  \ the real adventure started. \nAfter some minutes of driving we stopped because\
  \ of traffic, but after an hour we knew it was not going to move, people started\
  \ getting out of their cars and asking what was happening. The reason for the traffic\
  \ was a strike from the truck drivers and they were going to stay there all night.\
  \ Fortunately we were a couple of meters away from the only point of return and\
  \ we went back, to the nearest city. We drove to Buenaventura, it was already getting\
  \ late and dark and it was raining, that city is known because it is dangerous and\
  \ we had no idea were to go. When we arrived to the city we had to look for a hotel\
  \ to spend the night, but before we could begin we got a flat tire! The car stopped\
  \ and we were in the middle of nowhere. After some time a taxi driver passed by\
  \ and helped us arrive to the nearest gas station were we could get some help. As\
  \ it was closed he helped us arrive to the nearest hotel, but when we arrived his\
  \ car wouldn\u2019t start. We had to help now to look for more help. Finally we\
  \ could find a room to spend the night. The next morning we were happy to go back\
  \ but now our car did not want to start! After all we had been trough this was not\
  \ a big problem, so we solved it and started our journey. We did not have time to\
  \ eat breakfast and a car ride that was supposed to be 1 hour and a half turned\
  \ out to be 6 hours because of the traffic, so we arrived, tired, with the same\
  \ clothes and with no food in our stomachs. But home, finally home."
