Text: "It was my first day in Srinagar, the capital of Kashmir, which is an Indian\
  \ state and is known for its everlasting beauty. It is often said in India that\
  \ beauty comes with its own shortcomings and Kashmir is not spared from this saying\
  \ as it is terrorized by some people and it remains secluded from people for almost\
  \ half a year.\nThere is this theory of life which says that beauty and truth always\
  \ comes out. You can\u2019t prevent them from emerging.  I decided to find and explore\
  \ this beauty.\nSo, I checked into my hotel in Srinagar and after taking some rest\
  \ I got ready to explore the beauty and the hidden truths about the place. I chatted\
  \ with the waiter, who was a Muslim, for about fifteen minutes and asked him about\
  \ the riots and acts of terrors that prevent Kashmir from growing and developing.\n\
  His name was Iliyas, and he told me that even in these terrorizing situations Kashmir\
  \ has this peaceful vibe which makes you forget all your troubles. I requested him\
  \ to show me the city\u2019s magnificence and he agreed willingly. He took me to\
  \ the beautiful hills covered with golden snow. Iliyas took me to his home and we\
  \ had lunch there. He told his sister to make Paneer korma and Tandoori roti, an\
  \ Indian spicy dish.\n After lunch, Iliyas\u2019s son Imran brought me some special\
  \ kashmiri tea and I enjoyed it a lot. I was already absorbing the peace which Iliyas\
  \ was earlier talking about. The place was like heaven. I was looking at the sun\
  \ directly and the sun was smiling. \nIliyas and I then took a horse ride in the\
  \ depths of the hills. On our way we chatted a lot. I asked him about his wife and\
  \ he went silent. He always smiled if he didn\u2019t have any answer to my questions.\
  \ After some time he told me that his wife died in a bomb blast last year. I was\
  \ shocked to hear his story and I was amazed by his outlook towards life. He taught\
  \ me a great lesson.\nThe day was over and we had some herbal tea in the hotel.\
  \ I explored Kashmir emotionally, I met many people during my trip but Iliyas stayed\
  \ with me. That is the beauty of traveling,you take away things that become a part\
  \ of you and they live with you always. \nAfter I left Kashmir I heard the news\
  \ that riots have started there, around the same hotel in which I stayed and from\
  \ that day I pray every day for Iliyas\u2019s well being. I don\u2019t know if he\
  \ is alive or dead, but he will always remain alive inside my heart. I traveled\
  \ more after meeting Illiyas. I went on different trips to interact with the local\
  \ people and hear their stories."
