Text: "We\u2019d stolen only a handful of moments alone before I\u2019d agreed to\
  \ follow him to Calabria. I\u2019d travelled all day on three different trains to\
  \ get down to the toe of the boot. And now, one hand holding his cigarette out the\
  \ window, the other steering, he drove us up the mountain, winding closer towards\
  \ my first glimpse of his tiny hilltop town.\n\n\u2018This place, the people, it\
  \ is a little bit strange.\u2019 \n\nLike all his words in English, he said them\
  \ deliberately, the sentence hanging with an invisible question mark and a cautious\
  \ chuckle. Yet when he spoke in his native Italian, his words were so deep and muffled,\
  \ they had to be prised from the earth before I had any hope of understanding them.\n\
  \nHe said he knew why I liked him. He wasn\u2019t, he said, like other Italians.\
  \ It was true. In all my visits to this country, I\u2019d never met anyone quite\
  \ like Piero. It wasn\u2019t because of his gold and blue features, it was his dreams\
  \ for the world and his place within it. They were of change, equality and peace,\
  \ but they came from a position of great despair. In the dead of night, for all\
  \ the glorious vistas his town offered of the stars beyond, Piero was trapped within\
  \ its crumbling walls and the views of its people who had never left.\n\nWith nowhere\
  \ to go, our days were finally just for us. We swapped languages and stories, music\
  \ and sides of the bed. We cooked, we ate, we walked. Hand in hand, up and down\
  \ stone stairs, squeezing between houses and ducking under strings of clothes that\
  \ had for generations concealed the giggles and secrets of children. We were greeted\
  \ every few steps. The girl from the other side of the world, here with their favourite\
  \ son.  \n\n\u2018But you know, really, I am alone. There is no one here who understands.\u2019\
  \n\nThey were the words of a young man bursting with aspirations, in a town without\
  \ work, no money to leave, and far too much time to think. \n\nLate in the evenings,\
  \ when the others had staggered home from the pub, Piero would find someone willing\
  \ to share the icy night for one last wine and cigarette. Their words would slip\
  \ into dialect and while I couldn\u2019t catch them in the clouds of smoke and mist,\
  \ I knew they spoke of escape.\n\nBut one night, wrapped in scarves and a veil of\
  \ red wine, we sat with the group of friends who had come to accept me as one of\
  \ their own. Amidst the laughter, I saw Piero wiping tears from his eyes.\n\n\u2018\
  Why?\u2019 I asked. \n\n\u2018You. Here. With my friends, in my strange little town.\
  \ It\u2019s a wonderful, magical thing.\u2019\n\nAnd it really was."
