Text: "In 2008 I embarked on a journey that would forever alter the course of my life;\
  \ living in Costa Rica. I booked the three-month volunteer position on a whim. At\
  \ 22, I had no experience with solo travel and I would sooner get by with hand gestures\
  \ than with all the Spanish I spoke. I was paradoxically terrified and exhilarated.\
  \ \nWith no concept of my safety beyond the rusted bars of my San Jose hostel, I\
  \ spent my first three days writing in my journal, eating stale pop tarts and awaiting\
  \ my adopted mother. \nWhen Sandra finally arrived, I was instantly drawn to her.\
  \ She was a vibrant, 30-something woman with a soft, warm face and gentle brown\
  \ eyes. Her laughter created space in a room and everything felt lighter in her\
  \ presence. Although her English was choppy, I felt like she understood me. We became\
  \ fast friends.\nFor the next ninety days, I lived with this Tika and her family.\
  \ They welcomed me into their middle class home and enthusiastically shared their\
  \ \"Pura Vida\" lifestyle. \nWhen I wasn't exploring, I spent much of my days with\
  \ Sandra. One of my favourite pastimes was going with her to the grocery store.\
  \ I was intrigued by the strange labels and oddly confused with the overconsumption\
  \ of powered milk. What struck me most was watching Sandra, week after week, set\
  \ food aside because she couldn't afford it. Each trip was a humbling reminder of\
  \ my first world conveniences and made me greatly appreciate the food on my plate.\n\
  I wrote everyday and found it fascinating to see my words come alive as I experienced\
  \ ups and downs, hardships and excitement, trials and errors; I could literally\
  \ see my personal growth expanding with every stroke of the pen. I knowingly packed\
  \ two books to house all my memories.\nAs I wrote my closing words in my first journal,\
  \ I came home to find a new book on my bed. Inscribed on the inside cover was a\
  \ note from Sandra, saying that after a day of searching, this was the closest to\
  \ a journal she could find. She went on to explain that she knew the importance\
  \ of writing to me and that she wanted to ensure I had another book to complete\
  \ my thoughts. \nOverwhelmed by her selflessness, I clutched the book to my chest\
  \ and cried. This incredible woman, who set groceries aside, went out of her way\
  \ to find me a journal. Never has a gift meant so much. \nThis book now serves as\
  \ a reminder of my time in Costa Rica, the importance of opening your heart, spreading\
  \ love in the world and living with the knowledge that there is always enough."
