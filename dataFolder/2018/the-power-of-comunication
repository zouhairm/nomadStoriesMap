Text: "\u201CTraveling \u2013 it leaves you speechless, then turns you into a storyteller.\u201D\
  \ \u2013 Ibn Battuta. We had not money and we couldn't let ourselves to travel over\
  \ the world, but we had some relatives in Uzbekistan and this was my first journey.\
  \  It was 10 years ago, when i was 9 years old. Our family wanted to go to Uzbekistan\
  \ to meet our relatives, but my purpose was to find new friends. I was just a child,\
  \ my life depended and still depends on new feelings.\nWhen we came near to border,\
  \ guards were searching my bag, i was surprised and i had asked myself: \"Why he\
  \ is searching me? Why my mom didn't say him anything? Why he has a gun? What is\
  \ going on?\" It was long and bored procedure. I was tired, but after 2 hours we\
  \ were in the Shargun, feeling of great enthusiasm again woke up. \nFirstly, we\
  \ went to the bazar (market), we bought something to eat. Then we went to my uncle's\
  \ hail. I saw there many and big rooms, cow, donkey, grape vines (I have tested\
  \ these kind of grapes there for the first time) and unknown faces. These people\
  \ were my uncle, his wife, his daughter, and his son-Let's call him Johny, later\
  \ one of he became my best friend. \nJohny was 14 years old, but our friendship\
  \ didn't start from this moment. We were from different planets. Our insights were\
  \ coordinately different. He was from rich family, but i was not. He was elder then\
  \ my physically and mentally. When we were together, he was talking about books\
  \ math, physics, critical thinking, for that time it was not interesting for me,\
  \ but i had a great memory, i remembered all thing which he said, i wanted to have\
  \ such kind clever friend. I wanted to achieve him, but he didn't want a poor and\
  \ stupid friend like me. He said that he doesn't want to see me.  I knew that to\
  \ achieve him i have to do 2 things:\na) To read more books\nb) To become rich\n\
  Becoming rich was impossible, but i didn't want to give up. I read a lot of books,\
  \ synchronized with all what he said before. After 2 years i became more clever\
  \ and we traveled to Uzbekistan and planned to visit my uncle and i went near to\
  \ their hail, gave a knock and he opened the door. I was happy to see him, but he\
  \ had a problem. His father died some months ago, because of this they had some\
  \ financial problems, but i didn't notice that our family became more stronger in\
  \ financial side. After long conversation, supporting him, we became the best friends.\n\
  I didn't give up and life said me \"Hello\", we are still best friends and i am\
  \ not sad."
