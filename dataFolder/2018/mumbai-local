Text: "It's early February and the last reminders of winter in South Mumbai are sweaters\
  \ and coats hanging off balconies to dry in the pale sun before being packed away\
  \ for the rest of the year.\n\nAt CST Station, I get into a relatively empty compartment\
  \ on a local train going up the Central line.\n \nI don't see him get on, but this\
  \ wiry, barefoot boy of about ten swings past me as we pull off and attaches himself\
  \ to the handlebars on the open door of the train car.\n\nHe's wearing a torn, red\
  \ jacket that's several sizes too big and it glows vividly in the yellow light of\
  \ the winter sun. The dirt on his body looks like it may never wash off, but he\u2019\
  s at ease on the open ledge, sailing with his eyes closed, his jacket billowing\
  \ behind him as the city sweeps past.\nSome men start bothering the kid, pestering\
  \ him with sharp remarks and scowls. The boy seems used to such reproach and gets\
  \ off at the next station, disappearing into its dense morning rush.\n\nAs he leaves,\
  \ a momentary hint of concern pervades the compartment. It is the kind that accompanies\
  \ the sight of a street animal in peril, and little more.\nI look around, trying\
  \ to read the faces of the other passengers to figure out what just happened.\n\n\
  A kind light shines in the earnest eyes of a ragged old man who explains that the\
  \ boy is a drug addict and part of a nameless gang of homeless kids who get high\
  \ and wander aimlessly on the local trains.\n\nThe man is about sixty, deeply wrinkled\
  \ and is wearing a stained, clay-brown shirt with longer-than-necessary sleeves\
  \ that almost hide the ancient scars on his right hand, which is missing a thumb\
  \ and index finger.\n\n\"Does anyone do anything about these kids?\" I ask.\n\n\"\
  Nobody cares,\" he says sadly, the creases on his face deepening until he is quite\
  \ lost in the intersecting folds of skin that seem to lay the geography of his difficult\
  \ life. \"Few make it past their early years. They fall off the trains or get caught\
  \ between the platforms in their stupor. Only the luckiest survive. You can often\
  \ spot them from their mangled limbs.' He offers a shy smile as he sees my eyes\
  \ drift towards his twisted hand and excuses himself, shuffling to the exit as his\
  \ station arrives.\n\nIn a moment he's gone, swept away in the rush of departing\
  \ passengers at Kurla Station and instantly replaced by a surge of boarding commuters.\
  \ \nVacuums do not exist in Mumbai.\n\nThe city makes space for everything, and\
  \ everyone. And when it can\u2019t find a use for them, it packs them away until\
  \ the next season."
