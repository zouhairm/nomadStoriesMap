Text: "\u201CSos vos de Rusia?\u201D \nThis question woke me up. I knew that Spanish\
  \ in Argentina is different from Spanish in Spain, but I didn\u2019t think I would\
  \ not be able to understand such a simple question. \n\u201CAre you from Russia?\u201D\
  \ she repeated in English. \n\u201CYes, how do you know?\u201D I replied. \n\u201C\
  I saw these funny Cyrillic signs on your phone. Wake up, we are landing soon\u201D\
  . \nI looked at my neighbor; dark long hair, bright black eyes and apparent soft\
  \ skin. \n\u201CIs someone meeting you at the airport?\u201D she continued the conversation.\
  \ \n\nNo way, I thought. Are they all that open and friendly to strangers? All those\
  \ warnings of \u201CLatin America is dangerous \u201C and \u201CYou should not trust\
  \ strangers\u201D immediately appeared in my mind. However, I could not resist that\
  \ warm energy only Latin people have... And that is how my adventure began. \n\n\
  It was a week of dancing, eating \u201Casado\u201D, re-learning Spanish and attempting\
  \ to understand cultural differences. I have to admit, it was weird to listen to\
  \ the girl I just met sitting next to me calling her friends, screaming: \u201C\
  Let\u2019s party tonight, I met an amazing Russian at the airport!\u201D It was\
  \ weird to start dinner at 10 p.m. and to know that they actually dance salsa instead\
  \ of tango. Moreover, to be kissed on cheek by each new arriving \xABamigo\xBB was\
  \ definitively somewhat awkward for me. All these were weird but absolutely amazing!\
  \ \n\nTraveling for me is not about the places anymore. Buenos Aires is marvelous,\
  \ but Ricoleta, La Boca or Florida Street would not be the same if I had been there\
  \ alone or even in a touristic group. I believe that the only way to understand\
  \ the place you travel to is to spend time with the locals. For instance, I wouldn\u2019\
  t be able to \u201Cfeel\u201D tango music if I had not heard the stories of my new\
  \ friends as they told me what their Italian and Spanish grandparents had been through\
  \ when they immigrated to Argentina. \n\nI am sitting on top of a rock in Bondi\
  \ beach, Sydney, as I am writing this text. And right in front of me I glanced a\
  \ group of loud and laughing people, drinking something. They are sharing one cup\
  \ with a stick in it. I recognize \u201Ccalabas\u201D and \u201Cbombilla\u201D.\
  \ This Argentinian \u201Ctea ceremony\u201D explains their culture the best: live,\
  \ laugh and share. Suddenly, I feel being part of it. Now I know that If I say a\
  \ word in Spanish to them, they would accept me to their circle, offering their\
  \ drink, smiles and stories. I am sorry my reader, something is calling me to made\
  \ this of a better day."
