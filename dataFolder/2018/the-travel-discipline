Text: "I was looking for the line connecting all my travel experiences. To be honest,\
  \ I am not a travel-aholic, but a travel lover instead, I don't travel for the seeking\
  \ the new, I prefer the pleasure of discovering something I can't even imagine,\
  \ I don't travel to escape something, while traveling is for me a fuel to energize\
  \ again and to face what I fear. \nI am certainly a person with a vivid imagination,\
  \ when walking somewhere I get seduced and magically fascinated by a detail or a\
  \ life scene bringing me far from reality and from a place seeming always similar\
  \ to itself, when I choose a travel destination is for me a need to open my spirit\
  \ to a new life stage, a ceremony to become a person each time closer to my real\
  \ self.\nTravel is the best discipline I know to reconcile energies and life expectations,\
  \ travel is for me as thinking aloud, an activity to make thoughts become experiences.\
  \ I traveled in Italy and abroad, often on uncontaminated islands and mountains\
  \ when I really felt free, but also in crowded cities where I felt free in a completely\
  \ different way, getting lost in the chaos of a metro or in the unfamiliar yet warm\
  \ sound of a festival in a lost village of Puglia.\nThere is always a deep need\
  \ behind all my travel itineraries, a need to discover myself through discovering\
  \ people and cultures, it is often said that travel opens the human mind to the\
  \ new, but I believe that even more often travel is what you need to feel complete,\
  \ to reconcile with your soul and to live well. \nTravel is a decision that pushes\
  \ me to the edge, each time in a different way, the conscious choice to stand in\
  \ front of my real self. \nThere is an episode that can describe the feeling I look\
  \ for when traveling, this summer I was spending some hours in a beautiful beach\
  \ in Spain, I was with some friends, it was windy and the see was rich in rocks,\
  \ girls where thirsty, boys were hungry, sand was really hot and nobody followed\
  \ me on the water. I found a cliff where the see was mingling with heart, and for\
  \ me this represented the moment I was expecting all the holiday, the moment to\
  \ dive in water, again and again, alone, having so much fun that a couple of persons\
  \ I didn't know probably perceived my joy from the beach and followed me, they joined\
  \ me into water, each time diving in the sea I was feeling closer to myself and\
  \ to this new unity, fighting and winning the humble fear to be alone facing my\
  \ limits."
