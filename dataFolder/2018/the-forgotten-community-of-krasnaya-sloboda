Text: "Krasnaya Sloboda is a Jewish settlement across the river from Quba, a small\
  \ town in central Azeibaijan.  It is a community of Mountain Jews called the Tats.\
  \ Until we arrived to Azerbaijan I never heard of this town and didn't not that\
  \ Tat communities still exist. Frankly, they look like any other Azeri people and\
  \ if they didn\u2019t wear yarmulkes I wouldn't know that they are Jewish.\nWe loved\
  \ our visit there albeit the entire time I felt like I am in a Jim Jarmush movie.\
  \  The village's main street is all large beautiful expensive brick houses and mansions\
  \ but looks completely abandoned and except for few speeding cars we barely saw\
  \ any people on the street the entire time.  However, I had a constant feeling that\
  \ we are being watched and followed.  Every person we met said Shabbat Shalom and\
  \ tensely waited for a response. After responding the same we were immediately interviewed\
  \ about who we are and why are we there.  After I mentioned having roots in Israel\
  \ they usually relaxed and became extremely nice. It took a while to find the synagogue\
  \ because even though people here are trying to be helpful their ability to explain\
  \ directions is lacking. Usually they are throwing their arms around pointing to\
  \ some vague direction in the horizon while the actual location has nothing to do\
  \ with their description. Probably, because no one here uses maps\u2026the fact\
  \ that we noticed in all of the Caucuses.\nAfter visiting the synagogue we stooped\
  \ at local chayhana (tea house) which turned out to be a social club for the few\
  \ remaining elders in the entire village. As we walked in, the conversations stopped\
  \ and an interview began.  Once they realized that we are Jewish the atmosphere\
  \ became all warm and friendly.  Soon more and more elders poured in to check us\
  \ out.  I was right feeling being watched because the rumor of our visit spread\
  \ around the village in no time and they all came in to see us. The ones who already\
  \ got the \"411\" on us were now conveying the information to the new ones in their\
  \ language, which as we learned is very similar to Farsi; the Tats came here thru\
  \ Iran several hundred years ago.  Once they learned that we live in New York the\
  \ excitement grew even further because most of them have relatives in Brooklyn\u2026\
  \nAfter several cups of tea and small talk and before we said our goodbyes we took\
  \ pictures with the eager elders.  The whole experience was just lovely and heartwarming.\
  \  We walked to the famous Arched Bridge and crossed back to Quba."
