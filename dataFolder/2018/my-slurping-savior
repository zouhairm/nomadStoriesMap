Text: "It was the middle of the night, around last-call, though you couldn\u2019t\
  \ tell from all the lights. At street level, Tokyo has a way of blending night and\
  \ day, due to blinding storefronts drenching the pavement in fluorescence. The hubbub\
  \ never dies there, tall buildings stretch up into the black night while below on\
  \ the bright streets one young tourist is on a search for some magnificent ramen\
  \ to end his night on. It was on those streets that I would meet a merciful local\
  \ and continue a long tradition of \u2018Help the poor tourist clearly out of his\
  \ element\u2019.\n\nWhen I entered the ramen restaurant I thought I knew what to\
  \ do. Walk over to the vending machine and hit the most faded button on it for the\
  \ most popular option there. Hand the printed slip of paper to the chef. Claim an\
  \ empty stool and wait. Breathe in the wafting green onions, musky pork belly, and\
  \ savory broth. Listen to the bubbling water, the chop of knife on cutting board.\
  \ Watch the steaming cloud surround everyone, patrons bent over bowls, ties over\
  \ shoulders as they loudly slurped up sustenance. When I took my seat at the bar\
  \ though, the large, square-jawed ramen chef across the counter yelled a brusque\
  \ question at me. I was taken aback, having never been asked anything before. I\
  \ looked back in dumb shock, unsure of how to answer. Everyone was focused on their\
  \ bowl and I didn\u2019t blame them. I\u2019m sure the ramen was that damn delicious.\
  \ I looked back at the ramen chef, silently begging the universe for mercy. I heard\
  \ a quiet voice beside me say something in Japanese to the ramen chef who nodded\
  \ and laughed and turned back to his cutting board. I turned to the guy beside me,\
  \ and used my rudimentary, embarrassing Japanese to thank him. The young man in\
  \ the suit smiled and nodded his head.\n\u201CWhat did the chef ask me?\u201D I\
  \ was curious to find out what I\u2019d bungled.\n\u201COh he was wondering if you\
  \ were okay with some vegetables on top. Like cabbage and stuff.\u201D\n\u201COh\
  \ of course. I\u2019m fine with anything.\u201D\n\u201COkay I told him to make it\
  \ like mine, so it will be the same. I hope you enjoy it!\u201D\n\u201CThank you!\
  \ I wish I knew enough Japanese to get by. Sorry for the trouble.\u201D\n\u201C\
  No it\u2019s fine! You gave me a chance to practice my English actually.\u201D\n\
  \u201CWell I\u2019m glad I could be somewhat useful.\u201D \nWe both shared a laugh.\
  \ \n\u201CActually, if you\u2019re free after, I can show you another ramen place\
  \ that\u2019s great as well.\u201D He said.\nAnother bowl of ramen right after already\
  \ eating one? This was my kind of guy.\n\u201CAbsolutely! I never say no to more\
  \ food.\u201D"
