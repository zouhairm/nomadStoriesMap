Text: "As a gift for this family, I should have bought apples - not the rosy red kind\
  \ that I'm used to in the UK but the awful sour green ones that we refer to as cooking\
  \ apples. They can't get enough! All day long they demolish tonnes of fruit. This\
  \ amongst other intriguing habits have been revealed to me in my trip to Minsk.\n\
  \nHaving picked up a smidgen of their language, I can now count to ten and say 'a-pri-cos'\
  \ and 'conserv-erani-babi': apricots and baked beans - not served together of course.\n\
  \n Reading is a little more challenging - there is a character that looks like an\
  \ 'a' but sounds like a 'd', a 'w' that sounds like an 's' and a symbol that looks\
  \ like 2 back to back 'k's which makes a 'z' sound. \n\nAll in all, my most successful\
  \ communicative exploits are through sign language. They can tell me when it's time\
  \ to eat and sleep and I can ask them if it's okay to gave a drink. The basics are\
  \ covered but by some miracle I've been able to achieve much more.\n\nThe oldest\
  \ daughter, Tanya - or 'Danya' in a Belarussian accent taught me a weird spiritual\
  \ trick. One person stands still with their hands clasped together and closes their\
  \ eyes and another walks round them in circles placing one hand in front of the\
  \ others eyes. After 2-3 minutes of this revolving and humming a Russian folk tune,\
  \ the first person open their eyes and attempts to push their hands together but\
  \ cannot. It is as though your hands are suddenly magnetically opposed or you're\
  \ holding an invisable ball. I can't pretend to know the scientific static energy\
  \ based explanation for this but I will always remember the excitement of coomunicating\
  \ such a phenomenon without the tools of language to assist. If this was not a connection\
  \ with the people then I don't know what is."
