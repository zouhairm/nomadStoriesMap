Text: "I arrived in Buenos Aires a few days ago. I\u2019m still setting myself into\
  \ this chaotic, colourful and noisy world, which reminds me of nothing from my delicate\
  \ Italy. The streets are dirty, men whistle at the girls in the streets and every\
  \ corner contains a danger\u2019s excitement. However, more than the street\u2019\
  s danger, this morning I have to deal with a much more serious problem: a ridiculous\
  \ coldsore on my lip. And tomorrow I will start a Spanish course. Not a great first\
  \ day at school. How can it be so hard to find a pharmacy? I was going down the\
  \ usual road to the market, but the umpteenth protest demonstration forced me to\
  \ walk another path. I stop, and sigh. When I look up, I notice an elderly man watching\
  \ me. He wears a long coat, sunglasses and his hair is as white as snow. His gaze\
  \ settles on me, and then he fades. Finally, the pharmacy! Once done, I see a library\
  \ with a particular name, Il Malinconico Ruffiano. It seems interesting, I enter.\
  \ Books everywhere, mostly old and used, vinyls, newspaper clippings and a familiar\
  \ da Vinci portrait hangs. I hear Etta James\u2019s voice from a gramophone. There\
  \ is an intrinsic inclination to beauty in this library that attracts me. I pick\
  \ up a Pavese book. I smile sadly, last time I had a copy in my hands I recited\
  \ the words with Suzanne. Suzanne, who is now on the shores of another tropic. A\
  \ voice calls me back to the present: Conoces a Pavese? It's the same gentleman!\
  \ Despite my hesitant Spanish we discuss literature, and as if the speech would\
  \ gently follow a planet\u2019s revolutionary motion, we end up talking about the\
  \ obsession of all Argentines, tango. He is also a tango shoemaker, and he proclaims\
  \ to be able to teach me how to dance. I believe him. The day after I find myself\
  \ at the milonga, he comes with a gift: he made tango shoes for me! The only thing\
  \ I now expect is the unexpected. He doesn\u2019t invite me to dance. I wait patiently,\
  \ but still he offers no signs of interest. When a boy asks me to dance, I hesitate,\
  \ but then, noticing him tilting his head, I accept. Dancing, I feel so light and\
  \ free. Sat again, he blames me declaring that our date seemed to deny the intimate\
  \ connection established during our previous meeting. Here my first essential lesson\
  \ on tango, and on Argentineans. We argue like an old couple, and I laugh thinking\
  \ of the jealousy. I beg him to forgive me, and he did. Since that night we went\
  \ to the milonga every Sunday. Jorge became my closest friend in those months of\
  \ my Argentinian dream."
