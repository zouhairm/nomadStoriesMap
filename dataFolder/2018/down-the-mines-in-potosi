Text: "Looming over the city of Potos\xED, Bolivia, like some prospectively sentient\
  \ monster, is the red, brown, crusted, and impassably barren face of the Cerro Rico\
  \ mountain. Where its extensive silver deposits once brought great wealth to the\
  \ Spanish Empire, today it stands as a pyramidal parable of exploitation: this mountain\
  \ has been implicated, Eduardo Galeano estimates, in the deaths of some eight million\
  \ men. \n This unfathomable number circulates in my mind as I approach the entrance\
  \ to one of the thousands of mines that perforate Cerro Rico, almost to the point\
  \ of collapse. Despite the perpetual risk of accident and silicosis, thousands of\
  \ men\u2014the bulge of coca leaves in their hamster-like cheeks jarring with their\
  \ lean, beaten bodies\u2014still enter here every day, often with some tourists\
  \ in tow. I have decided to probe the limits of my claustrophobia by being one of\
  \ them. \n Our guide, Juan, takes us through the imperceptible membrane separating\
  \ the world of Pachamama, the earth mother, from the altogether darker underworld\
  \ of El Tio. We soon pass a curious effigy of this malevolent spirit, a horned creature\
  \ with flowing locks of colourful ribbons surrounded by offerings of coca leaves,\
  \ empty bottles of pure alcohol, half-smoked cigarettes, the whole scene punctuated,\
  \ unmistakably, by his absurd cock of rock. \n Death hangs in the stifling air.\
  \ \n We penetrate further into this abyssal place, a fetid phantasmagoria of distant\
  \ shouts and imagined screams, of susurrous hisses and sonorous clatter, which seems\
  \ to be getting louder and louder...\n \u201CRun! Run!\u201D\n My vision takes on\
  \ a horror movie aesthetic, all blurred images and intermittent light, as my boots\
  \ struggle for speed in the squelching mud. We stoop into an enclave seconds before\
  \ some miners and their cart\u2014threatening to come down on us, almost literally,\
  \ like a ton of bricks\u2014hurtle by.\n This sprint leaves me desperate to catch\
  \ my breath. Yet in here, well over 4000m above sea level, this is a fruitless task.\
  \ I mistakenly remove the protective bandana from my mouth to allow more air to\
  \ enter; instead comes fear in a mouthful of dust, each particle a ghost engaged\
  \ in alveoli assault.\n I want to leave. We stay for two more hours, crouching,\
  \ scuttling, clambering, suffocating. It's a singularly oppressive experience, haunting\
  \ my dreams for weeks. But the singularity of it leaves me with no regrets, at least\
  \ not for myself. That this is the daily reality for so many men, however, is regrettable\
  \ in the extreme."
