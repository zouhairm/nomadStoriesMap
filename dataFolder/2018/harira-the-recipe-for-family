Text: "I kept sipping. She kept staring.  With every bite of my harira, I had the\
  \ undivided attention of a curly-haired doe-eyed toddler who was focused on studying\
  \ my every move.  She watched me measure every serving and guide each spoonful to\
  \ my mouth.  She had the same bowl of harira, one just for her, that she was being\
  \ fed to her as she glowered. To her right sat her devoted mother, focused on feeding\
  \ her growing daughter.  To her left sat her protective father, holding her hand\
  \ as his eyes looked on scanning Medina Square.  It was clear she was an only child.\
  \  \u201CMom,\u201D I uttered under my breath.  My mother warmly glanced my way\
  \ as I leaned in beside her and whispered, \u201CWhy is that little girl staring\
  \ at me?\u201D  My mother set her teacup down as I proceeded to place my bowl on\
  \ the picnic table we shared with the Moroccan family. She turned me towards me,\
  \ looked into my eyes with a prideful gaze and whispered: \u201CYou are unravelling.\u201D\
  \ She repositioned the wrapping of my scarf around my face, tucking in the loose\
  \ fabric under my chin.  My mother converted to the Muslim faith six years prior,\
  \ and had shown me how to properly wrap a hijab in the past.  I decided to dress\
  \ like my mother dressed every day while in Morocco; everything covered, including\
  \ your head and neck. It was working, until we came to this small eatery in the\
  \ middle of Marrakech.  I continued to enjoy my meal.  She kept staring.  As I tried\
  \ to divert my attention elsewhere, I could feel her eyes scanning the melanin of\
  \ my skin.  The warmth of my discomfort grew as I tried to focus on something other\
  \ than the ogle of an inquisitively adorable three-year-old.  I darted a few glances\
  \ her way, but she never disengaged. Her eyes were stuck on me.  The breezy evening\
  \ sky lured others in to join our family-style seating for a bowl of the chickpea\
  \ and pumpkin-based bisque offered for the US Dollar equivalent to about thirty-five\
  \ cents. Harira is most notably known as the national soup of Morocco, shared amongst\
  \ family usually during Ramadan. I looked at my bowl; one more spoonful left.  I\
  \ lean into my bowl and scraped the final serving. I look up at my number one fan,\
  \ whose eager eyes were yearning for my reaction, and offer the serving to her.\
  \  To my astonishment, the little girl pursed her lips, and took a slurp.  My eyes\
  \ widened in disbelief as I smiled with endearment. Her face was full of happiness\
  \ as she looked up to her mother and father; all she wanted was to share.  In her\
  \ eyes, we were family too."
