Text: "We\u2019re getting our kicks on Route 66 and as we\u2019re on the Mother Road,\
  \ it\u2019s only fitting we\u2019re travelling as a family. The mother: the tarmac.\
  \ My dad: the driver. My sister: the navigator. Me: the writer. \nWhen you picture\
  \ Route 66, you imagine a straight road where the concrete continues to expand under\
  \ your tyres. Actually, it\u2019s an old road that parallels the newer Interstate,\
  \ and thanks to Eisenhower removing it from the Highway System in 1985, it\u2019\
  s easy to lose track. But sometimes getting lost means you find what you\u2019re\
  \ looking for. That\u2019s the kind of philosophy you need on the road. No itineraries.\
  \ No hotels booked. You find what you find, you sleep where you sleep. You enjoy\
  \ everything. \nOur last pit stop, in Paris Springs, Missouri, we went to a gas\
  \ station. Most of them on the road are shut down and, like the Tinman, they need\
  \ oil to function, but some are near enough to an Interstate that they get business.\
  \ Browsing outside the shop, we met Gary, the owner, who\u2019s about 60-years-old.\
  \ He took us into the garage, which was filled with old cars, wax models, memorabilia\
  \ from the 60s and cardboard cut-outs of American icons. He turned on the radio\
  \ and gave us some chilled Root Beer, a staple in America but something I had never\
  \ tried before. It tasted like a blend of bubblegum and cough mixture. \nIt would\
  \ be a clich\xE9 to say that the garage was like stepping back in time. It wasn\u2019\
  t, the waxy appearance of the figures, the 2D cardboard cut-outs and the ice-cold\
  \ taste of root beer kept me solidly rooted to the present. But it allowed me to\
  \ imagine the road back when it was a thriving community, before it lost to the\
  \ Interstate and lots of places became ghost towns. \nGary wasn\u2019t going to\
  \ charge us, so we gave him $20 and in return he gave us two Missouri fridge magnets\
  \ for me and my sister to put in our first homes and a Black Cherry soda for us\
  \ to share on our last day. \nWe left with Gary telling us we\u2019re beautiful\
  \ and that we had to remember him for his pretty blue eyes. And they were pretty,\
  \ as if the bright blue Missouri sky was reflecting back into their little pools.\
  \ He told us to drive safe and make good memories together. \nAs I turned around\
  \ in the back seat, waving goodbye through the window, his figure started to get\
  \ smaller, standing over the Route 66 sign painted on the road, waving with an old\
  \ gas pump in his hand. \nA quick pit stop turned into an hour that we would remember\
  \ for a long time. That\u2019s why no one has a schedule on the Mother Road."
