Text: "It\u2019s a glorious, sunny day & I\u2019m on the back of a silver scooter,\
  \ zipping through the breathtaking mountainous boulder heaps of Karnataka\u2019\
  s Hampi Island. Hampi is a remote collection of ancient Hindu sites & monuments\
  \ (loosely termed an island, as you have to cross a river to get to the main tourist\
  \ drag) & an UNESCO World Heritage site. The landscape looks like a vision of Mars\
  \ from a vintage sci-fi film, all red dust, arid heat & huge rock formations, which\
  \ seem placed with amazing precision by some unseen hand. Beautiful, jaw-dropping\
  \ hill-top temples & shrines surround.\n\nMy friend Andy & I rented the scooter\
  \ this morning, as he\u2019d heard about a beautiful lake out in the mountains &\
  \ we planned to go swimming. Hampi is sparsely populated & the place still has the\
  \ wild, kinetic energy which drew hippies here during the counter-cultural heyday\
  \ of the 60\u2019s. The staff at our hostel warn us off driving aimlessly, telling\
  \ us \"Be careful, bandit country\".  We pause for a beat to consider this intel\
  \ but I can tell immediately from Andy\u2019s impish grin that we\u2019re be heading\
  \ out anyway.\n\nAs we near the spot we start to see signs, in English & Kannada,\
  \ warning us of alligators in the lake. Just as we start to feel lost we stumble\
  \ across a gathering of local teen boys parked seemingly in the middle of nowhere\
  \ & ask them if they know the way to the lake. Suspiciously, they just point directly\
  \ behind them. It seems too easy, yet, certain our bike is about to be stolen, we\
  \ head tentatively into the vegetation anyway. Stumbling over rocks & being scratched\
  \ by dry herbage, we\u2019re about to turn back when we stumble across the azure\
  \ lake. Completely deserted & easily the size of 2 Olympic pools, it\u2019s worth\
  \ the wait.\n\nWere there truly alligators here? Andy doesn\u2019t seem to care\
  \ and is already halfway to the water. Suddenly a local, elderly gentleman appears\
  \ and greets us. \u201CAlligators?\u201D I ask \u2013 he laughs and shakes his head.\
  \ \u201CIs safe\u201D he says \u201CChai?\u201D There is nothing on the small beach\
  \ - no hut, no stall, he doesn\u2019t even have a bag. Curious, I reply \u201Csure\u201D\
  . Off into the bush he goes and returns with a small amount of kindling. He proceeds\
  \ to squat and make a small fire underneath a boulder. From nowhere appear a bottle\
  \ of water, a tiny tin saucepan and some paper cups. \u201C10 rupees\u201D he says\
  \ with a grin. Before long other locals appear to sample the man\u2019s lush, spiced\
  \ tea - we've found the best chai in Hampi! \u2013 the boys at the side of the road\
  \ had simply been earlier customers!"
