Text: "Curiosity can be a wonderful quality. It can also push you to places where\
  \ there is seemingly no return. \n\nThere is a bay in the Cinque Terre in which\
  \ stands a jagged, double platformed cliff face. The lower ledge is frequented by\
  \ adventure junkies wanting to dive into the tepid waters below. There is, additionally,\
  \ another vantage point from which only those who dared, leaped. I had been lying\
  \ in the bay for hours, observing these cliff jumpers, yet I had not seen anyone\
  \ make the leap from the very top. \n\nA young Italian boy sat next to me.\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019s not that high you know\u201D\n\n\u201CEasy for you to say, you\u2019ve\
  \ probably done this your whole life\u201D I said.\n\n\u201CI\u2019ve actually grown\
  \ up in a landlocked region of Italy. This is my first visit here\u201D.\n\nFeeling\
  \ ashamed, I put more effort into learning about Julian and his upbringing.  \n\n\
  \u201CBut I would say I\u2019m really quite lucky to live here. There\u2019s so\
  \ much to see and even more to discover\u201D\n\nWith that he stood up and made\
  \ his way towards the cliff edge. I followed suit.\n\nClimbing up to the first ledge\
  \ of the rock face, I glanced towards Julian, whose turn it was now to make the\
  \ jump. He turned towards me, smiled and leaped off the edge, surfacing in the water\
  \ below.\n\nIntending to head back but thinking I could get a better view from the\
  \ top of the cliff, I fed my sense of curiosity and ventured upwards. I could see\
  \ as far out as the blue haze in the distance, past the luxury yachts and quaint\
  \ caf\xE9s. I drew in a deep breath of sea-salt air. \n\nDeciding it was time to\
  \ return, I attempted to climb back down the rock face. However, the steep ascent\
  \ made for a dangerous and unstable descent. I couldn\u2019t climb back down. I\
  \ had unknowingly climbed up a one-way path and the only way down was to jump off\
  \ the edge. \n\nI felt trapped.\n\nI would definitely injure myself trying to walk\
  \ down, so in that split second I made a decision before my rational thoughts could\
  \ kick in. I jumped. \n\nReckless.\n\nStupid.\n \nPlunge. \n\nMute. \n\nNoise.\n\
  \nAs I resurfaced, the formerly loud crowd had gone silent. I searched for Julian\u2019\
  s face in the sea of concerned faces. I smiled and he began to clap, causing a contagion\
  \ of applause. In that moment I understood what he meant by his words before. Discovery\
  \ can apply not only to physical places we\u2019ve found but also to our capabilities\
  \ we\u2019ve uncovered along the way. Curiosity can lead to many new discoveries;\
  \ of places and of self, but the latter can only occur when we have the courage\
  \ to push ourselves over the edge."
