Text: "Every year hordes of tourists descend upon Japan for hanami \u2013 the celebration\
  \ of the cherry blossom or sakura to the locals. I\u2019d decided 2017 was my year\
  \ to witness this great spectacle; and a huge bucket list tick to boot. Little did\
  \ I know this decision would push me to the edge. \n\nThe flights to Osaka were\
  \ booked and I began to research the trip. But my joy turned to pain as I read historical\
  \ records for the last ten years and realised I had made a terrible mistake. It\
  \ seemed I would miss the revered \u2018full bloom\u2019 by at least one week. \n\
  \nI wracked by mind for a solution. There was nothing I could do; the flights could\
  \ not be changed. My chances of seeing cherry blossoms were slim at best! My only\
  \ option was to hold the faith. \n\nThe date grew closer. Reports of \u2018first\
  \ bloom\u2019 came in from Okinawa. Day by day reported sightings inched their way\
  \ further north. My hopes of seeing cherry blossoms were fading. \n\nThen something\
  \ strange happened. The somewhat predictable bloom times in the southern parts had\
  \ not continued into the Kansai region. First bloom in Osaka and Kyoto just wasn\u2019\
  t happening. \u2018Maybe tomorrow\u2019 was the official word, but this went on\
  \ for over a week. \n\nThen finally, first bloom was reported, and the predicted\
  \ full bloom in Osaka was the day of our arrival. However, there was still a chance\
  \ storms would wash the blooms away, so I held the faith. \n\nWe touched down at\
  \ Kansai airport around midnight; a night\u2019s sleep then first stop Osaka Castle.\
  \ \n\nWe eagerly made our way to the castle grounds. For a moment time stood still.\
  \ Blushing cherry trees lined the walkways. A gentle breeze blew and delicate flower\
  \ petals drifted to the ground like confetti, littering the walkways, delighting\
  \ tourists and locals alike. \n\nFamilies and friends gathered along the riverbank\
  \ for the traditional Japanese hanami party; spreading picnic blankets and sharing\
  \ a meal to celebrate the arrival of the sakura. Street vendors peddled all kinds\
  \ of food and drinks, adding to the fair-like atmosphere. \n\nAs I reached out to\
  \ touch these coveted flowers I was fighting back tears. I tried to look away but\
  \ my husband caught the glisten in my eyes. He laughed, yet he understood - I had\
  \ invested every ounce of my being into this day. \n\nHolding the faith to see those\
  \ tiny flowers had pushed me to the edge but, standing there surrounded by cherry\
  \ trees in full bloom, it was worth it. Yes, I unashamedly admit there were tears;\
  \ happy tears. The moment was perfect."
