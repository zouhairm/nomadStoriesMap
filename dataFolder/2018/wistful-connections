Text: "Many moons ago, and what it seems another lifetime ago, I took my first trip\
  \ outside of the United States. I was leaving the Americas behind for a bit for\
  \ European shores for a taste of culture with a side of adventure. Due to it being\
  \ my first experience abroad, I took what seemed to be the sensible approach and\
  \ booked a tour catered specially for young adults. Even tough it was a packaged\
  \ tour most of the time you were left to your own devices to explore. As it was\
  \ common, and probably still is, London was the tour\u2019s departure point and\
  \ I could not have been more excited about this. Ever since I could remember it\
  \ had been a must go destination for me. The stomping grounds of Shakespeare, Charles\
  \ Dickens and the Beatles, hunting grounds of Jack the Ripper,  the streets where\
  \ Oliver roamed, over which Mary Poppins flew, the city that survived the Blitz.\
  \ The myths, tales and stories that had cast a spell on me since childhood would\
  \ finally come alive before me. \n\nIt was the mid 90s and there was a renewed vitality\
  \ permeating British culture. This extended to the arts, music and even to politics.\
  \ After the fall of the Berlin Wall and the end of the Cold War, there seemed to\
  \ be a prevailing sense of hope in the air. An excitement for the possibilities\
  \ the future could bring. And London seemed to be the center of this energy. Cool\
  \ Britannia \u2014 or Cruel Britannia, depending on who you asked \u2014 was everywhere.\
  \ \n\nBefore my trip I was deeply entrenched in the British music scene. I enjoyed\
  \ grunge but upon hearing Blur I took a sharp turn towards Britpop. And I had just\
  \ arrived in London, then capital of cool, at the height of Britpop. After checking\
  \ in to my hotel I quickly ventured out into the streets and it was amazing. The\
  \ simple act of walking about was rush. People would grab guitars and suddenly at\
  \ the street corner there was an Oasis sing a long. From Carnaby Street to Camden\
  \ there was this thriving energy. It is the closest I've come to experience to maybe\
  \ being around in the 60s. After a lifetime of feeling like a lone wolf, like the\
  \ odd one out, I finally felt I belonged. Here, in London. It was a feeling I\u2019\
  ve never forgotten and don't believe I soon will. \n\nTimes change, and so do we\
  \ all. London is still a magnificent place to visit. A beacon of history, art and\
  \ culture. It molds itself to your needs and expectations, as it probably did with\
  \ me many years ago. And if you're lucky enough to tap into it's soul, it is an\
  \ unmistakable experience."
