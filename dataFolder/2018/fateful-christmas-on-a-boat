Text: "It was a magical christmas '15 on the Spanish island Tenerife thanks to the\
  \ random encounter with an awesome guy that took us on a tour on his ship.\nAfter\
  \ we had set sail and were a bit further out he offered to use his equipment - glasses\
  \ and fins - to take a dip in the ocean. \nI\u2019ve never really found joy in getting\
  \ wet, so I passed.\nSabrina on the other hand has spent most of her life in the\
  \ water so she didn\u2019t let this opportunity slip.\nShe changed into her bikini,\
  \ took the glasses and fins and jumped in.\n\n\nShe happily splashes about in the\
  \ water and Carlos and I smile at seeing her having fun.\nShe looks at the ship\
  \ from underneath the surface for a few seconds, and Carlos and I start to chat\
  \ and forget about her for a moment.\nWhen I look in her direction again I see her\
  \ just diving under, swimming away from the boat.\nEven tho the wind is blowing\
  \ harshly Carlos and I suddenly hear roaring engine sounds to our left and both\
  \ immediately stand up to see where it\u2019s coming from and inhale sharply when\
  \ we see the quickly approaching source of the sound:\nA black air cushion boat\
  \ is darting towards Sabrina\u2019s path at relentless speed from maybe 50 meters\
  \ away, and she is still under water without a single clue of what is coming for\
  \ her and would reach her in less than five seconds.\nCarlos and I immediately start\
  \ jumping up and down waving shouting yelling for the guys on the boat to notice\
  \ us over its thundering engine, and for a seemingly never ending moment it seems\
  \ completely hopeless - our words just thin air in the wind that is easily carried\
  \ out to sea and lost forever. Desperation hits me like a plank across the face\
  \ and sends a jolt through my spine as the black danger is ferociously closing in.\n\
  And just three short seconds before the inevitable impact Carlos thunders the loudest\
  \ HEEEEEEEYYY!!!! I have ever heard coming out of a person\u2019s throat, and signals\
  \ the now alert driver to stop his boat. Which he immediately does as he slams on\
  \ the brakes.\nAnd to this day today I am still incredibly amazed by how quickly\
  \ this vessel managed to slow down, from unforgiving speed to a complete halt within\
  \ not even two meters; It seemed impossible. And just as it stops, a head pops out\
  \ of the water mere inches away from the exact center in front of the boat where\
  \ the ship\u2019s engine\u2019s propeller would\u2019ve relentlessly plowed through\
  \ and cleaved her head to tiny pieces.\nSabrina looks obviously shocked and aghast,\
  \ but she\u2019s alive and well.\nCarlos had just saved her life."
