Text: "\u201CIt's been 167 days since I left home and this trip is not even half over.\
  \ Embarking on this bike trip has probably been one of the best decisions I've ever\
  \ made, and the journey thus far has been nothing short of amazing. Every day is\
  \ like school without the classroom. Always learning. Always encountering. Always\
  \ moving. Being able to do it in ways that fuel my passions is priceless. Reading,\
  \ writing, capturing, seeing, listening - being. To have an endlessly changing horizon\
  \ and for every day to have a new and different sun.\u201D\n\nThose words were from\
  \ April of last year. \n\nIt seems I always find myself reading through old journal\
  \ entries, reminiscing about what a simple life it was. It feels surreal to think\
  \ that trip, that lifestyle of living, was my reality last year - what feels like\
  \ a lifetime ago. A lot has changed since then.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\
  \u2800\u2800\u2800\nEight months and some 12,000km pedaled. My bicycle was my home\
  \ and it took me on a journey from Canada to South America. Sounds intimidating,\
  \ but that was just what I did. If you can ride a bike, be willing to sacrifice\
  \ a few of life\u2019s many luxuries, sleep in less-than-ideal quarters, and don\u2019\
  t have anything better to do than to repeat that process over and over every day,\
  \ I\u2019d say it's anyone's game.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\
  \u2800\nAfter a while, time seems to do something weird, it slips a little. Schedules,\
  \ appointments, days of the week - they all start to become meaningless. And the\
  \ only sense of time comes from the rising & setting of the sun, the seasons. I\
  \ don\u2019t know what the epitome of being content is - but I would like to think\
  \ that is the closest I have ever been to feeling it.\n\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\
  \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nIt started to become my life, what I did. Cycling terrible\
  \ roads, sleeping in questionable places - and learning - experiencing so much.\
  \ Every smile was from an old friend, and every pause felt like home.\n\nI left\
  \ my life in Canada to escape routine, to set off on a grand adventure, and to experience\
  \ more of this beautiful world we get to call home - but it seems I traded one life\
  \ of routine for another."
