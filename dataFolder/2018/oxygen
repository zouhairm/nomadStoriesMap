Text: "I come from a lazy background. I also love to eat. \nI've always been a chubby\
  \ girl who couldn't actually stay fit cause, you know, Italian cuisine, and gym\
  \ is boring.\nUntil I discovered I had some minor health issues that prevented me\
  \ from having a full bright life. I couldn't even eat pizza without feeling bloated,\
  \ having my eyes and lips burst out in allergic reaction and keeping up with stomach\
  \ pain for 2-3 days. My body was crashing.\nI felt stupid. I just turned 29 and\
  \ my body was not responding like one of my age. I owe it to my body to be healthy\
  \ and fit. I wanna live this life fully, and I cannot do that if I can't even enjoy\
  \ simple nights out with friends cause my body is demanding healthier choices.\n\
  So I decided to be healthier. But I was still lazy, you know? Gym was always boring,\
  \ and I couldn't do it just because I wanted to.\nSo I thought: what do I wanna\
  \ do in this life? Travel. Discover. Live everything. \nI should do that: get healthier\
  \ to travel. So I set a goal: I wanted to experience something grand, something\
  \ that could be the drive on this journey. I decided I wanted to climb up Mount\
  \ Everest (Base Camp).\nAnd so I did.\nI trained for months with that goal in mind.\
  \ That was a bit crazy cause I never reached a mountain higher than 2000mts, and\
  \ I never trained for something that difficult.\nI did it. And it was the most enlightening\
  \ thing I ever did. I'm afraid of heights, I'm hungry, I'm a sleeper so in those\
  \ condition I could have gone insane. I actually slept (?) at -9\xB0, feeling the\
  \ cold so hard that I couldn't even fall in deep sleep. I had hallucinations and\
  \ severe physical problems while doing this. I walked twice on a swinging 100mts\
  \ high bridge. I did it. I was pushed to the edge of my physical and psychological\
  \ abilities. \nOne hour far from my final target, I was having severe problems with\
  \ my breathing and starting to feel dizzy. I didn't have enough fuel in my body\
  \ to go on. I was alone on that mountain, I couldn't call anyone to help me or drive\
  \ me there. I just needed to decide: can you or can you NOT make it? I decided.\
  \ I DECIDED I could. I decided I could reach the base camp, I could live a happy\
  \ life, I could become the person I wanted to be. Right there. I stepped forward.\
  \ I got to the top of my journey. It was the most explosive feeling I ever felt\
  \ in my life. Now I know I can do everything. And I want to. I want to do it again.\
  \ But not only there. Everywhere. I wanna experience everything I possibly can in\
  \ the world."
