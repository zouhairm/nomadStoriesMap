Text: "A cluster of life events have left me wondering at the crisp age of 19 what\
  \ life is truly about. Society has created this perception that happiness is found\
  \ when you land a good paying job, find a wife, move into a big house and have top\
  \ of the line materials (clothes, cars, toys, etc). This perception of happiness\
  \ couldn\u2019t be more wrong. A last minute decision lead to me driving half way\
  \ across the country with my cousin, just my 60L back pack, her suit case, and a\
  \ car. We crashed at a friends house just out side of Halifax for the first 4 days,\
  \ and while we were there we went to a few off trail hiking spots and visited some\
  \ friends that we haven\u2019t seen in a while. After Halifax we drove out to Glac\xE9\
  \ Bay, where we saw family I haven\u2019t even spoke too in years. We spent some\
  \ time at our family homestead, lookin at old photos of my great grandparents and\
  \ grandparents that passed years ago. We wrapped up our last minute trip after 12\
  \ days. This trip has greatly impacted my life. No there wasn\u2019t any near death\
  \ experiences or exciting encounters but it has made me realize how wrong the original\
  \ perception of happiness was. Happiness isn\u2019t about what you have or where\
  \ you work, happiness comes from relationships and adventure, doing the things that\
  \ you truly love. As the movie into the wild states \u201Chappiness is only real\
  \ when shared\u201D."
