Text: "Dear reader, have you ever been to a place where you could hear the voice of\
  \ a culture?  While you take your time to answer the question you are more than\
  \ welcomed to meet the voice of Montblanc the medieval town of Spain.\nOn a warm\
  \ summer day I was greeted by a sense that came from far away nowadays resting within\
  \ the giant walls of Montblanc. That sense took me back to time when dragons where\
  \ real and love was pure and sensual as a red rose bleeding from the arms of loved\
  \ one. St. Jordi gate is like a teleport. Once you go through, you end up surrounded\
  \ by Romanesque and Gothic monuments that will whisper to you all the secrets they\
  \ have heard about maids and their mistresses. By taking your time and looking on\
  \ the road, it is almost possible to walk in the footsteps of knights. Step by step\
  \ recreating historical moments of the fight with the dragon and gatherings at the\
  \ Placa Major where market took its place.\nAt the beginning, I was cautions about\
  \ the moment of time I was experiencing, but then I fell in love the way you fall\
  \ asleep: slowly, and then all at once. I dare to say it was not the peasant\u2019\
  s robe that was hanging loose around his waist or brown sabots that reminded me\
  \ of little gnomes. Noir Leveche the hot-summer Mediterranean wind passing through\
  \ his thick strand of brown hair that led me to believe that I have been here before.\
  \ Suddenly, selling fresh beef and brewed ale was not just a question of my common\
  \ sense, it was a tradition that I urged to be a part of. \nI followed the wind\
  \ that led me through the razzle-dazzle of markets inhabitants into the small garden\
  \ encircled by tall deliciously green bushes. In the middle was a grey headstone\
  \ that gave me shivers, although, it was one of the warmest days in Montblanc. I\
  \ took few steps closer and noticed engraving that looked as old as the world. It\
  \ said: \u201CEl que busca la verdad corre el riesgo de encontrarla.\u201D (Who\
  \ searches for truth runs the risk of finding it). With a fear of being close to\
  \ finding the truth, I let my body slowly slide down next to the headstone. I closed\
  \ my eyes in hope of not letting reality interfere with my beliefs. From then on,\
  \ all I could hear was my own voice greeting people in the market, the enchanting\
  \ sound in the background and the delightful smell of fresh beef and ale."
