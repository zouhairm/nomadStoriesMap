Text: "It was a balmy Saturday morning and I was abruptly awoken by my IPhone alarm.\
  \ Too early, even for the roosters on the cherry farm I was visiting in eastern\
  \ Portugal. Despite the serene location and breathtaking landscape, I helped a friend\
  \ harvest her cherry crop to sell. As we drove up the winding roads to the local\
  \ market, I started to get nauseous. Not from carsickness, but from nervousness.\
  \ I did not speak the language, yet I was posing as a local. Selling fruitful goodness\
  \ to the masses. \nFor two days we plucked perfectly plump cherries. So ripe, they\
  \ fell into your hands. They were the most beautiful shades of red- dark to bright.\
  \ Something I had only ever seen in a stock photo. And the taste was even better-\
  \ sweet and juicy. I was confident that our cherries would be a hit, considering\
  \ I addictively consumed copious amounts myself. I was just concerned customers\
  \ would be turned off by an outsider trying to peddle goods, on their turf. \nIn\
  \ the town square, we set up our booth. Other vendors had crafts, baked goods and\
  \ fresh produce. I watched as they organized signage and placement of products.\
  \ My friend gave me a couple phrases, but insisted our large sign and obvious bright\
  \ red cherries or \"cerejas\" would be explanatory enough. Luckily, the morning\
  \ had slow foot traffic. The town elders eagerly sized up the array of vendors and\
  \ swarmed their best goods. They meticulously searched everything before they made\
  \ their choice. At lunch, the families arrived and would quickly choose. Just a\
  \ snack for the restless children, before they headed to the nearby stage to enjoy\
  \ the singers and dance troupes. \nWe were almost sold out by late afternoon. I\
  \ was a getting anxious to finish up. It had been a long day of standing and engaging.\
  \ It was a fun atmosphere and I wanted to unwind as a local. I reflected that in\
  \ my sales pitch. \u201CCervejas. Cinco mas!\u201D People came over in a hurry.\
  \ I also noticed a couple faces of disappointment. After the last cup was sold,\
  \ we went to enjoy the last hour of the event. I was quite pleased with myself.\
  \ I lived a life that wasn\u2019t my own, as a Portuguese cherry farmer. Just then,\
  \ one of the locals came over with a beer and invited me to celebrate. He quipped,\
  \ \u201CYou were shouting beer all afternoon. You deserve one now.\" Evidently,\
  \ due to my exhaustion or unintended excitement, I started shouting \u201Ccerveja\u201D\
  \ which is beer. Cherries are \u201Ccerejas.\u201D However, on a beautiful afternoon\
  \ like that, both cherries and beer would have hit the spot."
