Text: "Exiting the Sea of Bengal after an epic free-diving session, I see a gap-toothed\
  \ boy running my way. He splashes to a halt in the water before me. \n\n\u201CMing-gah-lah-bahr!\u201D\
  \ he exclaims. (It means hello.)\n\nTapping his chest, he says, \u201CLwin.\u201D\
  \ Then he pleadingly touches my snorkel. \n\nI\u2019m not wild about letting a stranger\
  \ put my snorkel in his mouth\u2026 but, I realize, it's possible he's never seen\
  \ what's under the water before.\n\nHe places my mask over his face; it drops to\
  \ his shoulders. Laughing, I tighten the strap, and he dives into the sea. \n\n\
  Emboldened, three younger children approach. One points at my GoPro, then looks\
  \ at me with questioning eyes. \u201CIt\u2019s a camera!\u201D I say, although I\
  \ know she can\u2019t understand. She stares back. I crank my hand in a circle,\
  \ miming an old film camera. She still doesn\u2019t get it.\n\nFinally, I think\
  \ of a way to speak her language: I point it at myself and take a selfie. \n\nTheir\
  \ eyes light up, and they ecstatically strike a pose. I\u2019d read that many Myanmarese\
  \ have never had their photo taken, so I pass them the camera. The girl grabs my\
  \ wrist and pulls me into the frame. Using my fingers to count along, I croon, \u201C\
  One, two, THREE!\u201D\n\nOn three, I toss her into the air and catch her.\n\nShe\
  \ squeals with glee. When I set her down, she throws her hands up and repeats what\
  \ she\u2019d heard me say: \u201CAhn, doo, fee!\u201D\n\nGuess we\u2019re doing\
  \ it again! Aung, Dedan and Htay take turns using the camera as we play on the beach.\
  \ Their counting improves with each daring stunt.\n\n\u201CAhnn, doo, free!\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CWahn, too, FREE!\u201D\n\nSoon, Lwin rushes towards us. He\u2019s seen\
  \ something exciting underwater, he motions, and needs my camera to document. My\
  \ wrist in one hand and my camera in the other, he hurries out to the reef where\
  \ he saw\u2026 \n\nA turtle! \n\nEvery few minutes, he lifts his head and shouts\
  \ words I only understand from his hand signals. A crab! A big fish! Another big\
  \ fish! \n\nI\u2019ve never seen anyone this excited about anything, I think to\
  \ myself. And I\u2019m pretty sure that, given the right support, Lwin could be\
  \ a genius at marine biology. Or a world expert on climate change!\n\nThe sun drops\
  \ to the horizon; it\u2019s time to head to my hotel. Lwin hands me my GoPro and\
  \ my snorkel. I take the camera, then hesitate. It\u2019s my last day in Ngapali\u2026\
  \ but Lwin will be here for the foreseeable future. \n\nPushing the snorkel back\
  \ towards him, I say, \u201CFor you.\u201D\n\nHis brows wrinkle, then comprehension\
  \ sends them shooting up to his salty hairline, his wide smile more magnificent\
  \ than any sunset."
