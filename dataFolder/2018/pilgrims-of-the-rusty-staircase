Text: "Somehow, after ten years of snowboarding I still often have to travel alone,\
  \ even to relatively close destinations. Sergiyev Posad is one of Russia's prime\
  \ religious centers just 70 km away from Moscow where I live. Its ancient Trinity\
  \ Lavra monastery attracts pilgrims from all over the country. I was, however, drawn\
  \ by an unusual snowboard park built by locals defying the standard rules of creating\
  \ such constructions with jumps and other freestyle elements. Curious of what it\
  \ might look like I decided to get on the road by myself \u2013 my buddies were\
  \ too lazy to leave the capital. \nMy smartphone's lockscreen showed a brisk -20\xB0\
  C early in the morning of February 23 as I pulled my heavy roller bag to the train\
  \ station. It was a lucky sunny break; you don't get a lot of moments like these\
  \ in Moscow winter. The only thing that was missing \u2013 I wished I was with my\
  \ gang. But as arrived I was in for a surprise. \nHardly did I step out of the bus\
  \ with my cargo when I saw a bunch of people carrying broad shovels to a flight\
  \ of stairs leading to the nearby ski stadium. The first thing I understood was\
  \ they were snowboarders. The second thing I realized was they looked like foreigners\
  \ about to get those stairs ready for riding. After I said \u201CHi\u201D I knew\
  \ they were Europeans filming for the famous Method Magazine. I bumped into an international\
  \ crew of four pro riders and a cameraman right in this place on the outskirts of\
  \ the provincial city. They were accompanied by a local who'd brought them there\
  \ and a Russian photographer. \nI observed the process closely as I had seen a street\
  \ spot ridden only on video. At first, they removed all the snow from the stairs\
  \ (residents must be grateful). Then they trampled the powder on the makeshift acceleration\
  \ line to make it flat. Finally they shaped the giant road-facing snowdrift that\
  \ was used to slide off from and pick up speed before jumping on the handrail. All\
  \ this took about an hour of energetic shoveling and stomping. \nI was freezing\
  \ standing there watching. But also excited to see something come out of nothing.\
  \ For them it must have been exotic to slide down a rusty line of handrails which\
  \ used to be bright yellow long ago at the decadent ski stadium in this Siberian-looking\
  \ city. But for me it was quite a picture to see well-dressed European boarders\
  \ brighten up this sad spot. \nAfter all, it was worth leaving the old places for\
  \ something unpredictable. I went on to find the snowpark I was looking for."
