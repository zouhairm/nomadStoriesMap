Text: "Even though the sun had already crossed the last quarter of sky, I decided\
  \ to go out to feel the autumn air. Alone, my music, my rithm, my dimension. Walking\
  \ up the gently hill that conduce from the main square to the residental area, I\
  \ noticed that every single house of the street had a garden. Lots and lots of tiny\
  \ and perfect front gardens, with perfect shaped bushes and perfect flowers shining\
  \ upon them. At the centre of this frame there was the apple tree. Not a majestic\
  \ tree, but beautiful. Just one or at most two per garden. All around the trunk,\
  \ a constellation of ripe red friuts, to bold for that meek place. The fuzzy colored\
  \ apples fired up the shadowed grass under the branches. But my wonder was for the\
  \ basket.\nIt seems that there are lots of apple in Estonia. It\u2019s a fact. Smartly,\
  \ Estonians, instead of throw apples they can\u2019t use way, they donate them to\
  \ anybody who needs or wants them. And how they do it is just awesome. Try to think.\
  \ You have too much apples for you and your whole family. You daily eat them fresh,\
  \ you produce kilos of jam and you bake apple pies evey week end but you still have\
  \ thousands of apples. So, you leave a basket of apples in front your garden\u2019\
  s gate. Quite an idea.\n\u201C\u041F\u043E\u0436\u0430\u043B\u0443\u0439\u0441\u0442\
  \u0430, \u0434\u0435\u0432\u0443\u0448\u043A\u0430, \u043F\u043E\u043B\u0443\u0447\
  \u0438\u0442\u044C \u044F\u0431\u043B\u043E\u043A\u043E\u201D.\n\u2013 What? Can\
  \ I really take it for free?\nI stumbled on her garden exactly when she was collecting\
  \ some apples for her basket. \u201C\u041F\u043E\u0436\u0430\u043B\u0443\u0439\u0441\
  \u0442\u0430\u201D she said again with a very unexpected smile. I figured out the\
  \ singularity of that moment. I hadn\u2019t seen a smile for a month, exactly since\
  \ I got there. In all likelihood, that was also one of her rare smile, I\u2019m\
  \ quite sure of it. I\u2019m Italian, we are smiling people and I missed a smile\
  \ so bad.\nWell, I did understand Russian but she probably thought that was a better\
  \ idea to try in English. \u201CTake an apple, if you please\u201D. I took one,\
  \ and than two more. That spontaneous smile encourage me so much.\nI\u2019d searched\
  \ in my new words storage to find the word \"ait\xE4h\" to thank her kindness and\
  \ I involuntarily beamed at her. Maybe to friendly from me because she replied with\
  \ a nod and go back home.\nI first thought \u2013 Wow! Free apples! \u2013 What\
  \ a shallow thought. The second thought that comes to me just out of the blue was\
  \ \u2013 Damn! Incredible! \u2013 and I felt a warmth sensation coming from the\
  \ chest. I hadn\u2019t understand what she did was just normal.\nEstonians don\u2019\
  t smile that much. Actually, they don\u2019t smile at all. But they are hearted\
  \ people. I set off again with my music in the ears and my backpack little heavier."
