Text: "The dust filled my nose like a blast from a steam engine as I hopped off the\
  \ the jeep. Eager children quickly invaded my space to paint the Indian flag on\
  \ my face for a quick buck.\n\nI had awaited the day I would witness the daily ritual\
  \ that is one of India\u2019s most notable events. The Wagah Border ceremony isn\u2019\
  t just about rivalry, the mutual forehead-high kicks, energetic hype-men that could\
  \ out-hype the ones at American sporting events, and outlandish headgear are believed\
  \ to be a display of brotherhood. The gate that was built after a macabre amount\
  \ of blood was shed over a man-made line is opened daily for a few of minutes as\
  \ the Border Security Force on each side performs a coordinated choreography to\
  \ show each is better than the other.\n\n\u201CYou must go down to the stage and\
  \ dance before the ceremony. Only women do it,\u201D my chauffeur explained to me\
  \ as we made the mile-long hike from the parking lot to the arena. \u201CIt is a\
  \ celebration of us being better at women\u2019s rights than Pakistan.\u201D\n\n\
  I had seen those extraordinarily lofty kicks as a display of incredible athleticism.\
  \ I hadn\u2019t foreseen participating in a discomforting tradition that basically\
  \ celebrated the plight of women that will be seated on the other side.\n\nThe arena\
  \ was filled to the brim. I photographed the Indian flag against the blue sky. The\
  \ national fervour beat down on me as much as the late afternoon sun\u2019s unfettered\
  \ rays. Everyone in the audience adorned the Tricolour in some form. Even the hype\
  \ man, who skipped around asking women to come down to the centre, had it printed\
  \ on back of his otherwise stark white tracksuit. \n\nAfter the nearly hundred women\
  \ took their victory lap, they burst into uncoordinated dance moves to the best\
  \ of the worst Bollywood songs. I stepped down to see if maybe I would feel the\
  \ pride. If the presence of my rights would dawn on me. If I could forget the lack\
  \ of rights of women seated across the gate that was actually a lot less imposing\
  \ than I had imagined. I looked up at the men cheering from the stands and saw the\
  \ brotherhood. The men who gazed at my knees visible between my tall boots and sweater\
  \ dress as I had climbed up the stairs were now waving a massive flag. My chauffeur\
  \ had escorted tourists to Wagah Border almost everyday in the past year. \u201C\
  I will still sit with you ma'am. In Punjab we don\u2019t let women venture alone\
  \ when it gets dark,\u201D he had insisted. He was clapping on the beat in the distance.\n\
  \nWas this what I was expected to shake my hips for?"
