Text: "I\u2019ve been told several times over that travel puts your mind at ease\u2014\
  especially when you\u2019re out alone. Lithuania was a treat all by itself, and\
  \ wow, would I love to go there again!\n\nOn the bus to the country, I met a French\
  \ guy with whom I could share a few experiences in Poland and ask about Lithuania\
  \ because he seemed to know more than me (haha!). I reached Lithuania at 6:30 in\
  \ the morning, and what I didn\u2019t know was that my watch was an hour behind\
  \ the actual time. I\u2019d told my Host that I would come over at 7:30, but then\
  \ what I didn\u2019t know was that the time was actually 7:30! My watch was an hour\
  \ behind and since I thought I had an hour, I went to McDonalds. And my dear friends,\
  \ I did not go there to eat\u2014I went there to use the bathroom! Yes, you read\
  \ it right.\n\nI even brushed in the toilet\u2014sure, go ahead. Laugh!\n\nSince\
  \ my hosts weren\u2019t at home, I had to drop my bags off at her workplace and\
  \ I did just that. Right after which, I hung out with this amazing person, Akvile.\
  \ She showed me around the place, all the local sights that needed to be seen\u2014\
  the ones that are invisible to usual tourists. The environment of the entire place\
  \ seemed to be at its peak! She took me to a bar and there she introduced me to\
  \ this fantastic and authentic Lithuanian dish called Potato Pancakes!\n\nShe took\
  \ me to the top of the Three Crosses (which I didn\u2019t know was actually quite\
  \ a prominent monument in Vilnius), and I could see the entire city from there!\
  \ It was absolutely breathtaking and I could feel my lungs expand uncharacteristically.\
  \ You know that feeling when you forget how to breathe? Yeah, that\u2019s how I\
  \ felt.\n\nAfterward, I met my hosts in the city center and said goodbye to my newest\
  \ friend. My hosts were incredible! They showed me all around the place, told me\
  \ loads about the country\u2014its heritage, food, and music; what made Lithuania\
  \ unique to all! They even told me something I was in fact, surprised to know! My\
  \ hosts had been to India!\n\nAfter reaching my hosts\u2019 place, they made Potato\
  \ Pie for dinner alongside Lithuanian bread and a rather special drink they call\
  \ \u201CKefir\u201D. I was so moved with their hospitality, that I had to make something\
  \ for them\u2014something Indian. So, I made carrot halwa. Come on, who doesn\u2019\
  t love this sweet dish? Yum! We all went to bed later, looking forward to tomorrow.\n\
  \nI believe sometimes, a person just knows what they\u2019re supposed to do. With\
  \ me, I believe it\u2019s living this nomadic life.\n\nAfter all, the world has\
  \ so much that we have to see!"
