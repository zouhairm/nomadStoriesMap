Text: "I left a life behind and moved to the resort town of Big Sky, Montana for a\
  \ year. I arrived at employee housing four days before off-season ended and spent\
  \ the days alone and missing family. The days passed and I caught the first bus\
  \ up the mountain for the resort's employee check-in. This is where I met Michelle.\
  \ Fifteen years my senior, Michelle knew the resort business and flew by the seat\
  \ of her pants. We clicked because our rough, sarcastic sides complimented each\
  \ other.\nOne week we opted to take a Yellowstone stagecoach tour, a perk of employment.\
  \ We arrived at the tour office and signed in. Our snowcoach resembled a yellow\
  \ school bus on thin bulldozer tracks. Michelle and I did a happy dance as we drove\
  \ through the west entrance. After an hour, our guide cheerily announced our descent\
  \ into Yellowstone\u2019s active volcano. \u201CFor the rest of the day, our chances\
  \ of death are higher than many in the world.\u201D I laughed as Michelle glared.\n\
  The day displayed a stunning Yellowstone. Bison milled between rivers and geysers\
  \ like dinosaurs navigating volcanic hot zones. Mountains in white sat proudly above\
  \ rivers dancing in the sun. The Old Faithful viewing platform was calm enough for\
  \ a lone bison to graze between the geyser and boardwalk. On the last leg of the\
  \ tour, our guide told us of a bison carcass resting a couple miles out atop a hill.\
  \ With boyish glee he yelled, \u201CI see movement! I think it\u2019s a wolf! See\
  \ that white streak along the hill?\u201D Everyone grabbed binoculars. Sure enough,\
  \ a pack of wolves followed a white alpha in a race across the hill. They ran along\
  \ the bank before turning our direction. The wolves ran the miles in two minutes\
  \ and stopped thirty feet from our vehicle. \nThe seemingly playful romp morphed\
  \ into a food-source showdown between alpha and challenger. The white wolf jumped\
  \ on a brown pack mate at the front of the chase and the pair rolled until red stains\
  \ marred the snow. Gaining its feet, the brown wolf limped far enough away to signal\
  \ submission. After consideration, the alpha turned the pack and left in a direction\
  \ unwelcome to the defeated. In minutes, all that remained of the wolves were the\
  \ fight grooves and traces of red in the snow. Our tour ended shortly after but\
  \ this marked the start of my self-discovery.\nUp to that point, I went through\
  \ life and work focused on those I missed back home. Yellowstone slapped me awake\
  \ and I endeavored to collect as many adventures as I could fit in a year."
