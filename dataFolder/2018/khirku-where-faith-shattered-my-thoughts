Text: "Nestled in the Dhauladhar ranges of India, is a beautiful village called Khirku\
  \ - a place still untouched by the tainted brush of time. A quiet village, where\
  \ cooing birds bring in the sunrise and the songs of the forest play second fiddle\
  \ to your thoughts. There are no signs that point the way, but if you stick around\
  \ a local is sure to guide you to this silent haven. \n\nBut for one night each\
  \ year, Khirku lets down its guard. The quiet houses are draped in lights, as the\
  \ villagers prepare to celebrate Nuala \u2013 a night long festival dedicated to\
  \ Lord Shiva. We all know Indian culture is synonymous with faith, and Khirku is\
  \ no exception. As luck would have it, I was invited by a few local friends to attend\
  \ this magical night. \n\nThe trek up to the village wasn\u2019t difficult. I did\
  \ stop to catch my breath, but the starry skies from the forest trail distracted\
  \ me from my fatigue. Khirku welcomed me with a bang. Singers hailed praise to the\
  \ Lord as I was greeted by my local friends and led towards the Dham \u2013 a feast\
  \ prepared by the village priests. Sitting cross-legged and eating on plates woven\
  \ from green leaves, Dham is one of the tastiest meals I\u2019ve ever had. There\
  \ were 7 courses, all served with rice and by the time I was done eating, I needed\
  \ all my strength to get up with my bloated stomach.\n\nThe Dham isn\u2019t there\
  \ to just feed you; it is the much-needed fuel for the night ahead. As the music\
  \ grows louder and the intoxication sets in, the Gaddi dance begins. This dance\
  \ is native to the Gaddi tribe of Himachal, a beautiful communal dance where you\
  \ step in a dancing circle as you sway to the beats of the drum.\n\nI\u2019m not\
  \ much of a dancer and was sitting on the balcony, when I witnessed something spectacular.\
  \ One man broke away from the circle and started swaying out of control. I thought\
  \ he\u2019d had a bit too much to drink, but was muted by what I saw next. The villagers\
  \ stopped and circled this man as his frenzy escalated. There is a belief that on\
  \ Nuala, the spirits possess some dancers and grant them powers to foresee the future\
  \ and bless the village. This man leaped around the circle with his eyes closed,\
  \ as people stood their ground with bowed heads and folded hands basking in the\
  \ light of their messenger. The frenzy ended as soon as it started, and the man\
  \ was escorted to the temple.\n\nNuala was the night my stoic thoughts were shattered\
  \ by faith. I stepped into the circle and danced the night away, humbled and exalted\
  \ by an experience I\u2019ll never forget."
