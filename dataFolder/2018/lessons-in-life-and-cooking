Text: "Shashi is an excellent cook. She is also a Brahmin widow. For the Brahmin of\
  \ Rajhastan, especially in the rural areas, this has ramifications.\n\nShashi was\
  \ born in a village in the north of India. Like most girls in that part of the world,\
  \ Shashi was trained from an early age to cook and run a house. In other words,\
  \ to be a wife. When she was in her early twenties, she entered into an arranged\
  \ marriage with a man from Udaipur and had two sons with him. When Shashi was 31\
  \ and her sons were young, her husband was murdered by his business partner.\n\n\
  \u201CAs a widow,\u201D Shashi says, \u201Cyou are already suffering. As a Brahmin\
  \ widow, you are made to suffer more. It\u2019s almost as though it\u2019s your\
  \ fault.\u201D For 45 days, she had to remain at home with her head covered, wailing\
  \ during the day. Other women from the village joined a wailing roster to wail with\
  \ her. Once the sun set, she was allowed to eat but couldn\u2019t eat or drink during\
  \ the day. Once the 45 days had ended, Shashi could stop wailing but had to remain\
  \ at home, her head covered, for a year.\n\nLife was tough for Shashi and her young\
  \ sons. Brahman widows can never remarry. They are not supposed to do menial labour.\
  \ She started taking in washing from hotels, but had to do it secretly. She started\
  \ cooking in a local restaurant.\n\nAn Irish tourist complimented Shashi on her\
  \ food and asked if she could teach him to cook the dishes he had enjoyed there.\
  \ Shashi spoke no English and couldn\u2019t write Hindi. She was nervous for her\
  \ first lesson and laughingly says that she spilled a lot of food, her hands were\
  \ shaking so much.\n\nFrom that first lesson, came more. Five years on, Shashi has\
  \ quite a following. \u201CI had never heard of Lonely Planet. But now I know that\
  \ Lonely Planet means busy,\u201D she laughs. She can speak English fluently enough\
  \ to deliver a six-hour class of masala chai, pakora, \u2018magic sauce\u2019 curry\
  \ base with variants, biryani rice and a range of breads, with jokes in between.\
  \ She can also translate the ingredients and methods orally into French, Swedish\
  \ and German.\n\nEntering Shashi\u2019s house, you learn a lot about spice. You\
  \ also learn to feel the food you\u2019re making and how to work the chapatti or\
  \ parantha dough. You also learn about triumph in adversity and about seeking opportunity.\
  \ Perhaps you learn that where there\u2019s light, there\u2019s hope and to be thankful\
  \ for the situation you were born into and to be grateful for people like Shashi\
  \ who are willing to share their experience and craft with you."
