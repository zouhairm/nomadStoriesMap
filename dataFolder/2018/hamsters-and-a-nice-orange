Text: "The Andean mountain range traces the west coast of South America for approximately\
  \ 7000km. When it reaches Colombia it splits into three parallel mountain ranges\
  \ called cordilleras. The centre of the eastern cordillera there is a savannah.\
  \ It is a wide plain that was once a glistening sacred lake, ruled by the Muiscas.\
  \ Now, it is the turbulent and grungy city of Bogot\xE1. \n\nBogot\xE1 is overflowing\
  \ with street art. I am meeting Nice Naranja, which translates as Nice Orange, to\
  \ explore the city's more off the beaten track murals. We weave our way through\
  \ polluted narrow streets, riding at times alongside impatient taxis and other times\
  \ on bicycle routes ridden with potholes. Of the many he shows me three stand out.\
  \ One by local artist Guache of a colourful and whimsical corn stretching 19 stories\
  \ high. Another is an explosive abstract  painting in desert hues. Nice explains\
  \ that it is by the Colombian painter Carlos Jacanamijoy, he says it explores Colombian\
  \ shamans and their healing capacities. The third is by the pioneering female artist,\
  \ Bastardilla. It pictures an androgynous indigenous person with a fire ablaze around\
  \ their neck. Their palm is flat before their chest bearing seeds. In the blue field\
  \ behind the protagonist are several more people, each with an eternal flame gripping\
  \ their neck, offering seeds. At the end, Nice asks me to accompany him the next\
  \ day to Palermo Sur, a very low-income barrio high up in the mountains. \n\nThe\
  \ following day, I climb with Nice up to the mountain until tar becomes dirt. Concrete\
  \ buildings eventually give way to houses built like patchwork from corrugated iron\
  \ and plastic drop sheets. We arrive at the house of Pedro and Maria, a mother and\
  \ son duo who had lived in their hut for 25 years. Windows were broken and mismatched\
  \ plastic covers various sections of the house. Nice and I set out to paint for\
  \ the day. From where we are, there is no hint of  the noise or smog below. We spend\
  \ the day decorating the house with colourful shapes and pre-Columbian symbols,\
  \ chatting to Pedro. Maria tucked herself away in kitchen. At midday, she waddled\
  \ over to us with plastic plates stacked high with chicken and rice. We accepted\
  \ the plates in disbelief. Yet, it was not until we were leaving that we realised\
  \ the extent of their kindness. Maria and Pedro had used the last of their gas to\
  \ feed us.  \n\nNo matter where you are when you look at mural, you can be sure\
  \ of the boundless love and passion behind it."
