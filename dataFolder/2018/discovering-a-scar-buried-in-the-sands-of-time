Text: "Inch-long running down my father\u2019s left temple is a scar. \n\nIncurred\
  \ someplace between India and East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) are two countries he\
  \ still refers to, as one home. Scars are pregnant-stories but father remembers\
  \ none. Growing up, \u2018it\u2019 summoned dinner-table interest, until my adolescent\
  \ imagination combined with his military career made it easier to pin the nettling\
  \ matter to a faux-battle.\n\u2026\n\nFew travels bring missions any more noble\
  \ than to just endure them; like my trip to father\u2019s second hometown: \u2018\
  Bali \u2013 Dewanganj\u2019, a town 100 kilometers West of Kolkata. City-cradled,\
  \ creature-comforted I dislike the idea the instant it comes up. \n\nBali means\
  \ \u201Csand\u201D and Dewan-ganj is \u201Ctraders-land\u201D. Like most of India,\
  \ BDG has unfailing history (vaunted terracotta temples) and tradition (silk thread\
  \ producers). Hardly impressed, I want the trip to end before it begins. \u201C\
  I have work. Come on, it\u2019s only one night. Check the river. It\u2019s one angry\
  \ fellow. Last time it ruined us, only \u2018sand\u2019 remained\u201D. A murderous\
  \ river, heat and dust, limited electricity, unlimited boredom - I yield for I love\
  \ him. We fly to Kolkata, catch a train, board a bus, hop on a ferry, and walk the\
  \ last seven kilometers. \u201CBack when I was a kid getting here was a pain\u201D\
  . Wasted, I mumble \u201Csure\u201D\n\nIn minutes I deduce houseflies as far more\
  \ devious. Scents assault - burnt and fresh cow dung, and fish in varied stages\
  \ of decomposition. Sidestepping a \u2018battery-charging-for-night TV\u2019 queue,\
  \ I sense the place as an unreal film-set: bulls seem timid; temple bells dubiously\
  \ metronomic, shopkeepers with patience larger than their inventory. Each hour brings\
  \ that recurrent question \u201CWhy here? Why not snowy mountains, or powdery beaches?\u201D\
  \ Left on my own, I try conversation. Locals speak in my mother tongue but I trip\
  \ on the inflections. Confusing open with closed-ended answers, I give up to watch\
  \ my rural-day trickle by.\n\nOnboard our return ferry, a voice puts father in a\
  \ daze: Rana (father\u2019s name)? Rakhal! You!\n\nThe two don\u2019t shake hands\
  \ as much as grab the other\u2019s elbow. Rakhal\u2019s moist eyes messes his syntax,\
  \ \u201Cwhy you came? no one remains. all gone\u201D \nI want time to pause, to\
  \ pick crumbs of a shared childhood, and piece its loves and losses. Our boat has\
  \ crossed over. Pointing at father\u2019s left temple, Rakhal asks, \u201CRemember?\u201D\
  \ Silence. Pulling up his trouser leg, he laughs, \u201CCome on Rana. Mango tree.\
  \ That summer. Caretaker chasing us\u201D \n\nI look at Rakhal\u2019s exposed ankle\
  \ - \u2018another\u2019 forgotten gash"
