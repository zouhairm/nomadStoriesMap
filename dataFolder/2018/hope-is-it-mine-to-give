Text: "Gathered around a table on the rooftop patio of the Amman Pasha hotel, our\
  \ home for the next two weeks. The sun slowly slipping below the horizon bathes\
  \ our leader in its red glow. He is interrupted by the crackle of a loudspeaker\
  \ atop a minaret. The Muezzin begins the Maghrib prayer. The meaning lost in translation,\
  \ but as the words float over the rooftops, a certain peacefulness permeates this\
  \ crisp night. \n\nTen days earlier, I received a text from a friend asking If I\
  \ would be interested in travelling to Jordan to interview refugees for potential\
  \ resettlement in Canada. Of course I did, but as we are both teachers felt that\
  \ this was a near impossibility. I was up to the task to make this dream a reality.\
  \ Emails were sent. Letters of reference and intent were written. And just when\
  \ I thought it would be a no go, permission was granted and three days later I found\
  \ myself on a rooftop in Amman.\n\nThe days blended as I met with Iraqis, Syrians\
  \ and Sudanese. A skipping record, stuck on the same track, stories of loss, threats,\
  \ and destruction. Fear the underlying tone, casting a dark shadow over the refugees.\
  \ An elderly gentleman sits across the table, glassy eyed, weary from the journey.\
  \ His house burnt down. He has lost everything. His wife is sick and yet, there\
  \ is still a glint of hope in his eyes. I realize, it\u2019s my reflection. Hope,\
  \ is it mine to give?\n\nIf the days belonged to the refugees then the nights belonged\
  \ to me. Wandering the streets of Amman provided a refreshing release from the regimented\
  \ protocol of the interviews. The distinctive sound of an oud being plucked draws\
  \ me from the crowd. Each step up the long staircase lined with antique typewriters\
  \ and telephones takes me up and out of the day\u2019s melancholy. Nearly a hookah\
  \ at every table, the fruity smelling she-sha mixes with the myriad of spices wafting\
  \ from the kitchen, cumin, nutmeg, and cinnamon, the few I can name. We get a table\
  \ on the balcony where we can savour our dinner and appreciate time with friends.\
  \ A final sip of my Turkish coffee, one too many as it turns out, reveals the grounds\
  \ and no matter how hard I stare, the fortunes of the refugees are not mine to see.\
  \ That night, I fall asleep feeling fortunate to call Canada home.\n\nStacks of\
  \ documents aligned on an old wooden table. Each one a family trying to find a safe\
  \ haven. When I close my eyes, I am transported back to Amman. Pages become faces,\
  \ faces become families, standing in line, and hope fills my heart."
