Text: "It wasn\u2019t my first train ride. That had been from Haridwar to Varanasi;\
  \ eight hour delay, no information, scrambling to read the passing signs in the\
  \ dark to figure out where I had to get off. I befriended one of the young guys\
  \ in my compartment who was making his way to Calcutta, 48 hours on the train. He\
  \ called his friend who worked as a controller for me, relaying the updates, trying\
  \ to make sure I wouldn\u2019t miss my stop.\nThis particular train ride was just\
  \ a few weeks later and much shorter for Indian standards: four hours, from Agra\
  \ to Jaipur. I reached my assigned bench, took out my journal and started writing.\
  \ \nAt this point in my travels, I had gotten used to the constant stares. The man\
  \ next to me was not shying away, peering at the page trying to discern my frantic\
  \ handwriting. When I looked up and smiled, he said, you write, very much writing!\
  \ I laughed and said, yes, that there was a lot to write about. \nOur conversation\
  \ began there, and through his limited English and some sign language, I learned\
  \ that he was traveling with his wife to visit his family for the weekend. He worked\
  \ as the manager of the train station in Varanasi. He asked me where I was from,\
  \ where I was traveling, and if I was alone. His wife sat across from us and smiled,\
  \ but I don\u2019t think she understood or spoke any English. \nAfter some time\
  \ he took out a plastic bag and offered it up to me with the words, try, try, sweet,\
  \ try! He pointed to his wife and explained that her mother had made the contents,\
  \ and he placed one in my hand. It was some kind of mashed nut and fruit, mixed\
  \ and molded together into a ball, and it crumbled as soon as I tried to pinch a\
  \ piece into my mouth. Good, good! I nodded my head enthusiastically, and for the\
  \ rest of the train ride this man made it his purpose to introduce me to all the\
  \ foods that passed through our compartment. First it was a mixture of nuts, tomatoes\
  \ and onion, which he bought and insisted I have half, even though it was so spicy\
  \ my nose started running. At each stop different vendors came on board, screaming\
  \ through the aisles about the goods packed into their brown baskets. My train buddy\
  \ looked at me: you try? Try! and he bought me a samosa. \nDeepak (his name, which\
  \ he penned at the top of the page in my journal) later asked to take a photo with\
  \ me, and made sure I added myself to his Facebook right there on his phone. He\
  \ has since stayed in good touch, writing me messages, his most recent comment on\
  \ a photo: me and my wife miss u"
