Text: "A few months back, I graduated to the first kind. These are memories from a\
  \ trip I can\u2019t forget; a trip that took me to Leh, Nubra Valley and the majestic\
  \ Pangong Lake. The trip starts from Manali-Leh highway which is One of the world\u2019\
  s highest motorable roads. To arrive in Leh, the capital of the ancient Kingdom\
  \ of Ladakh, we must cross five high mountain passes through the mighty Himalayas.\
  \ The Himalayas were spectacular with some strange landscapes\nIn the fragile Himalayas;\
  \ they were submerged under water thousands of years ago, and these granular pointy\
  \ structures were formed due to constant erosion of the mountain soil in the harsh\
  \ climatic conditions. Through those mighty landscape and breath taking scenery\
  \ we reached Leh, I always fell short of words in trying to describe this lovely\
  \ city. Very humble and honest people live in this part of the world, and some greens\
  \ survive the harsh weather too. And during evening it was time to see the beautiful\
  \ sunset from shanti stupa which is a magnificent landmark situated on a hill top,\
  \ from where the sunset paints the stark brown mountains in golden colours, in the\
  \ backdrop of a pure blue sky. Soak in the peace as you sip your evening tea from\
  \ the top of the world. The chilled nights are passed with Lugdi(a famous alcohol\
  \ from Manali made from rice) next day it was time for Ladakah via drive through\
  \ Nubra valley and across the world\u2019s highest motorable pass, \u2018Khardung-La\u2019\
  , at 18,380 feet. A remarkable attraction of Nubra valley, the other being its sand\
  \ dunes. Locals claim that these camels were used by traders during days of the\
  \ famed \u2018Silk Route\u2019, and originally belong to central Asia. How did the\
  \ sand reach this attitude? It is evidence that this great valley was once submerged\
  \ underwater. The skyline of Nubra valley is dominated by  a giant Buddha statue\
  \ at the valley's biggest monastery, and is a sight to behold against the backdrop\
  \ of dramatic blue skies. When it snows the local means of transport is yak last\
  \ but not the least was visit to famous Pangong lake \nSurrounded by stark brown\
  \ mountains, bluer than the sky, and so clean that you can see pebbles at its base.\
  \ Words and pictures can do no justice to its beauty. \nLadakh is home to a very\
  \ fragile and sensitive eco-system."
