Text: "You know that feeling when you\u2019re on a 350 cc bike, riding pillion on\
  \ the scary Himalayan mountain roads for 9 hours in freezing cold that has numbed\
  \ your legs and arms (despite layers of clothes and warmies), and you know you\u2019\
  re awake only because you\u2019re still moving (you\u2019d fall off the bike if\
  \ you fell asleep, and surely they would stop if you fell off the bike!)? When every\
  \ bone in your body is stiff, and the chronic lower back and leg pain you\u2019\
  ve been lugging around painfully for 15 years seeps through even the frigid numbness,\
  \ to accompany the tiredness. After hours of vomit-inducing hairpin turns, each\
  \ of which made you scold yourself for agreeing to go on this biking trip through\
  \ Bhutan and thus so far out of your comfort zone that the zone\u2019s a dot to\
  \ you, you see two girls coming down a hill asking you to stop because you\u2019\
  re finally at the farm-stay you\u2019ve been dreaming of the past few hours. \n\n\
  You shower, and let the nearly-scalding hot water hit your shivering body with the\
  \ satisfaction of cutting into a perfectly cooked steak. You then eat a hearty meal\
  \ put together by these kind Bhutanese people for six weary, cold, and unexpected-till-the-next-day\
  \ bikers from across the border in India. Come morning, you wake up breathing clean\
  \ mountain air in the gorgeous town of Paro, to the sound of puppies and the smell\
  \ of coffee and red rice cooked with ginger. You meet the loveliest people of a\
  \ nation with the world\u2019s highest happiness index, ignore health troubles and\
  \ your debilitating fear of heights to ride pillion upto 4000 meters to the Chele\
  \ la pass (the highest motorable road in Bhutan) and then trek up to the ridiculously-gorgeous-but-inexplicably-built-and-positioned\
  \ (on the sheer side of a mountain) Tiger\u2019s Nest Monastery. You get that sick-in-your-stomach-with-equal-parts-awe-and-fear\
  \ feeling, when you\u2019re crossing a valley on a narrow bridge thinking about\
  \ the legend of Guru Rinpoche (he introduced Buddhism to Bhutan) flying to the monastery\u2019\
  s current location from Tibet, on the back of a tigress. \n\nYou shake your head\
  \ in wonderment at this gorgeous land of the kindest, most generous-beyond-belief\
  \ people, who worship the god of fertility so reverently that their homes have drawings\
  \ of phalluses on the walls. Back home, you realize you haven\u2019t conquered your\
  \ fear of heights or turned into a biker overnight, but something within you (something\
  \ fundamental, visceral) has changed, and you can\u2019t wait to hit the road again.\
  \ You know that feeling?"
