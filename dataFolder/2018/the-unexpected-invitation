Text: "Living in a beautiful dream, where everything was almost perfect. I had everything\
  \ I have ever dreamed and desired. My family, my friends, my house, my mom, my boyfriend;\
  \ all that makes a person happy. Although nothing lasts forever. Suddenly my life\
  \ was going down, and all I tried to protect was gone\u2026 I had no way out, all\
  \ my fears knocked me and I wasn't ready for that change, so when I less expected\
  \ I received an invitation from someone that I really didn't know well, that person\
  \ was my grandfather; at that time he lived in Argentina so he invited me with the\
  \ amazing intention of showing me  his incredible city. I had never been there,\
  \ but all my entire life I wanted to go. \nAt that point all was like a dream, I\
  \ had never known my grandfather and with nothing left he invited me. So, when life\
  \ is telling you to go ahead, why are you gonna say no? so I took the invitation\
  \ and start a new adventure, not just because of knowing a new city but to meet\
  \ him either. When I arrived in Buenos Aires, I felt complete\u2026  a city with\
  \ amazing people, landscapes, a lot of history, amazing wine, delicious meat, meaningful\
  \ streets, the \u201Cpath\u201D of beautiful colors, awesome dance such as tango,\
  \ and so more. Even I liked that cemetery called \u201CLa Recoleta\u201D where Eva\
  \ Peron was one of their main characters. Until that moment, the experience was\
  \ amazing the mixture of food, music, love and a little of adventure was the best\
  \ medicine I could ever take. \nAlso, my grandfather was happy because not only\
  \ the fact of sharing with me that experience but for giving me the opportunity\
  \ of know another city and reshaping my mind and my perspective on life without\
  \ boundaries. Every moment and second was worth it, moreover, since that moment\
  \ my life changed, the way I react and solve my daily problems have something to\
  \ do with it. Having the opportunity to experience those amazing feelings at that\
  \ turning point of my life, has given me the opportunity to live as it were the\
  \ last day. That experience taught me that no matter how dark the sky could seem\
  \ always there will be a star waiting for you to see it. We spend most of our time\
  \ looking the \u201Cproblem\u201D but when you decide to take the risk and get over\
  \ those paradigms of life; you just turn around and realized that everything you\
  \ have always seeking for, have been there all the time; its just leave blindness\
  \ and things will happen when you less expected. Blessings could take any form,\
  \ in my case was that invitation that gave me the chance of being a brand new me."
