Text: "Do you know how it feels standing on a cliff on the extreme point of Europe?\
  \ At the beginning, the wonder captures you in a contemplation mood, as if you are\
  \ in a sort of natural temple, but there is no silence around you, the strong wind\
  \ blows and ruffles your hair. It is amazing and scaring at the same time. Here\
  \ you can see the real strength of the ocean, which 140 meters under your feet crashes\
  \ his blue-green waves on the rocks. This magical place is in Portugal not so far\
  \ from the capital Lisbon, and it is called \"Cabo da Roca\". \nI started my journey\
  \ from Lisbon one day in July, reached the \u201CCais do Sodre\u201D train and ferry\
  \ terminal, charged my Viva Viagem card at one of the many automatic cashes near\
  \ the platform, and board the train to Cascais. The 45 minutes trip, led me through\
  \ gold sand beaches, ocean, colorful terminals; until this pretty, little, marine\
  \ village with grey or red sloping roofs houses. It made me think about snowing\
  \ on a beach, or snowing sand or sandy snow globes\u2026 by the way while I was\
  \ trying to figure it out, I walked to find the bus terminal, looking for the number\
  \ 403 that would help me climbing that cliff. Found a seat near the window and watched\
  \ how people, cities and street became as tiny as I could put in my pocket and took\
  \ away with me, better than a static photo, just a miniature of that moment.\nAfter\
  \ 15 minutes the bus stopped in a free parking and opened the doors, suddenly the\
  \ sky fuses itself with the ocean, in a huge hug, and I was the little one, amazed,\
  \ and grateful to be there, to see, feel, and hear that symphony of sounds, colors\
  \ and emotions. The atmosphere in general here is a bit dramatic and no one want\
  \ to change this. In fact, tourists are not attracted by: the red and white lighthouse,\
  \ the surprising fully stocked bar, the souvenir shop or the monument where the\
  \ quote of famous Portuguese writer Luis Camoes is engraved. People of the world\
  \ want to see the end of the Europe \"where the land ends and the sea begins\",\
  \ and probably experience what people thought until 14 century.\nProbably in the\
  \ past whoever would have visited this cape saw the end of the world, where a 21-century\
  \ girl saw a steppingstone to a new adventure!"
