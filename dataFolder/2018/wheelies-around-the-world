Text: "My travel story doubles as my life story because travel and adventure have\
  \ been ingrained in the makeup of who I am for as long as I can remember. I was\
  \ raised in a family that believes in the importance of learning about other cultures\
  \ and absorbing as much of what this world has to offer as is possible. Both my\
  \ mom and dad passed down their love for adventure to my sister and I, but each\
  \ in their own ways. My mom taught us the importance of saving our money so we could\
  \ travel to distant countries and learn about other cultures and see the wonders\
  \ of this world. My dad taught us the importance of the natural world around us\
  \ through camping, hiking and other outdoor activities. Our whole childhood was\
  \ filled with camping/hiking trips to our favorite national parks and grand adventures\
  \ to dozens of countries around the world. Thus, it's no wonder why my sister and\
  \ I have such strong cravings to see the world. It\u2019s innate. It\u2019s within\
  \ us. \nHowever, on August 2nd, 2015, I embarked on a hike that would change my\
  \ life forever. My friend and I were on one of our typical weekend adventures when\
  \ I experienced a fall that sent me 45 ft. down the side of the mountain. When in\
  \ a near death situation, everyone talks about how they saw their life flash before\
  \ their eyes. But that\u2019s not what I saw. While I was falling, the only thoughts\
  \ that were swarming my mind were, \u201CI can\u2019t die, I still have so much\
  \ more to see in this world\u201D and honestly, I think that\u2019s what saved me\
  \ because in that moment, I was able to grab a hold of the side of the mountain\
  \ and the falling stopped. But when I tried to climb my way back up to the trail,\
  \ I noticed that my legs wouldn\u2019t move. 7 hrs later, I was taken to a hospital\
  \ where I was told I had shattered my L2 vertebrae and would never walk again. \n\
  I was terrified. Not of my inability to walk, but of how this would affect all of\
  \ the things I had planned for myself and all the places I had yet to see. Travel\
  \ is already tough enough WITH legs, so how am I supposed to make my dream adventures\
  \ come true without them? But as time passed, I got stronger in my rehabilitation\
  \ and more comfortable with my new life and my new body. I returned to school and,\
  \ eventually (about 10 months later), built up the courage to apply to a study abroad\
  \ program in Vienna. Those 8 weeks in Europe saved me. All of my fears were washed\
  \ away and I developed an even stronger yearning to see the world, despite any disability\
  \ working against me."
