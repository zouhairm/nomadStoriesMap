Text: "A NOMAD IN SWEDEN AS A WORKING VOLUNTEER TOURIST\n*WORKAWAY *WWOOF\nMy experience\
  \ started from Alicante airport to V\xE4ster\xE4s terminal. A friend of mine was\
  \ waiting for me there and I stayed a few months living with her family. She is\
  \ Swedish, married and has two beautiful Viking kids. I had met her during her Erasmus\
  \ in Valencia, where we had been University classmates. Now she works as a Swedish\
  \ teacher for refugees. Living in Sweden I have realized the high amount of refugees\
  \ who are in this country from Irak, Eritrea, Syria and  many others. When you meet\
  \ some, you cannot even imagine the story they relate on their life (teachers, doctors\
  \ or army pilots). During my stay in Norberg, i teached spanish and lindyhop dance\
  \ for the small community.\n\nAfter that, I went to a guesthouse in Dalarma region.\
  \ It was snowy and we had to prepare the Julbord which is the pre-Christmas dinner\
  \ buffet.  \nDuring Christmas I moved to H\xF6gan\xE4s in South Sweden to stay with\
  \ a family looking after five kids in a sheep farm. Most of these children were\
  \ a bit complicated (hyperactive, autistic or ill). However, we spent together these\
  \ days around the Christmas tree with lots of presents.\n\nThen, I crossed half\
  \ the country to arrive at Soller\xF6n, a Viking island inside a lake, on New Year's\
  \ and stayed in a farm owned by two Swedish girls. There were also two volunteer\
  \ boys from Argentina living there. The unexpected thing was that one of my hosts\
  \ used to cut herself. She had bleeded a lot other times she had done it. She was\
  \ in hospital few days a week. The decision which pushed me to the edge was when\
  \ I went down to the basement and saw a puddle of blood. It was then when I began\
  \ to search for other host.\nThe day I moved to a horse farm in  Eksh\xE4rad,she\
  \ suicided,which is a very common thing in Sweden. \nDutch people owned that farm\
  \ whith dogs and plenty of horses for ridind tours .\n I lived with three other\
  \ Dutch volunteers there for two weeks. You really feel \u201Cinto the wild\u201D\
  \ living in Sweden countryside farms. We get warm using the old swedish firewood\
  \ kitchen!.\n\nLater, I moved to an ecological village in Vetlanda where I fell\
  \ in love with a Latvian horse since I learnt to train him to ride.\nIn February,\
  \ to celebrate Saint Valentine\u2019s Day on my own, I travelled to Karlsborg to\
  \ live in a farm near a Nature Reserve in a camping site. Soon came a German boy\
  \ to help me at the farm.There were sheeps, a fjord horse,a shetland pony and a\
  \ friend black labrador dog Otto \u201Cthe adventures mate\u201D."
