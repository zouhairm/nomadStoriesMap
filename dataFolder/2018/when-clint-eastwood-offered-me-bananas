Text: "I turn to the direction of the car that rushes down the highway. Hitchhiking\
  \ on Hawaii seemed easier in my head. It has been an hour now; me trying to catch\
  \ a ride. Warm wind strokes my cheeks and I can catch a glimpse of the sun painting\
  \ colors in the sky. For a short moment, the beauty of this island distracts me\
  \ from my exhaustion. \n\nThen the car stops. Disbelief is replaced by hope and\
  \ I run towards what seems to be my ride. The driver introduces himself as Clint.\
  \ \u201CExactly\u201D he declares. \u201CJust like Clint Eastwood\u201D. I can\u2019\
  t help but smile. I throw my belongings in the back and sit down on the passenger\
  \ seat. He offers fresh bananas, I offer travel stories. More than once along the\
  \ way, I burst out in laughter because of the faces we pull. Even though the drive\
  \ is long, I don\u2019t feel tired anymore.\n\nWe slow down on a dusty road and\
  \ I notice wild flowers to my left. looks pretty, but something feels off. \u201C\
  This must be it.\u201D He turns to me, smiling. \"Excited?\". While grabbing my\
  \ bag, i shout \u201COf course!\u201D We exchange numbers and I give him a big hug\
  \ thanking him for bringing me all the way. I jump out and watch him drive off.\
  \ I am a little sad to see my new friend leave.\n\nI move up to a shack about fifty\
  \ feet ahead.\u201CHello?\" I say, then i knock. \"I am here for the voluntary farm\
  \ work, this was listed as the current address online \u2013\u201C A crackly male\
  \ voice interrupts me. \u201CThere is no work!\u201D I am puzzled. A man with grey\
  \ hair slowly opens the door. Sadness is now visible on his wrinkled face. \u201C\
  My wife and I managed the work on this farm together. Sadly, she died two years\
  \ ago. I may have been the better farmer, but she really was the heart of this place.\
  \ Even-though I tried deleting our website, people somehow still find their way\
  \ here. You will have to leave. I am sorry.\u201D The man sighs. As he closes the\
  \ door, i am left alone behind it. What now? I have no back-up plan. With six dollars\
  \ in my pocket and the next hostel being ten miles away, desperation starts to crawl\
  \ up in me. I lower my head and fight back tears. This was not how I imagined my\
  \ trip to go. I look up again and spot the flowers that I saw earlier. That is the\
  \ moment an idea flashes trough my head. I long for my phone and dial the last number\
  \ i saved.\n\nClint came to pick me up right after i called. \"A bed and fresh bananas\
  \ will be waiting for you.\" he announced. Now,being back in his car, I look out\
  \ of the passenger seat window to watch the sun set behind the volcanoes. My heart\
  \ fills with gratitude."
