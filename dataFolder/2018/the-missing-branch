Text: "Ever since I learned my family came from Hungary I dreamt of exploring the\
  \ rich historic land of the real life Dracula. \n\nI've always been shy so I often\
  \ avoid situations where I need to meet new people and when I finally got to Budapest\
  \ my trip was all about the sights. I stayed on the Pest side of the Danube where\
  \ the nightlife literally doesn't stop until sunup. I adventured up the Danube bend\
  \ where I walked down an 800 year old staircase and the only sounds were birds chirping\
  \ and the cobblestone streets and smell of wood burning stoves whispered secrets\
  \ of the past. I journeyed out to Lake Heviz, a naturally occurring sulphur lake.\
  \ I doubted its healing powers but I can honestly say it cured my tendinitis; even\
  \ if it did smell like rotten eggs.  \n\nHungary was magical, not only in the traditional\
  \ ways, but in a way I never expected.  I found beauty in the rundown buildings\
  \ and I learned that locals take such pride in their history that they won't fix\
  \ buildings that had been destroyed by the Nazis but instead treat them as a reminder\
  \ of what they've survived. Many of these buildings, even with trees growing through\
  \ them, have been turned into bars where people of all ages and circles come together\
  \ to share a pint and a laugh. \n\nI was nervous to meet my family for the first\
  \ time but the moment I saw them I instantly felt at home. With them I realized\
  \ my life had been missing something, an important branch of my family tree. I didn't\
  \ know who I was or what I came from. I can't even put into words how inspiring\
  \ and humbling it was to see the alluring river Tisza that my grandma loves so much,\
  \ the simplistic beauty of the church she was married in, or the small farmhouse\
  \ house she was forced to leave at gunpoint. I learned how small my problems are\
  \ compared to those of others. \n\nThe trip was one I'll never forget but what I\
  \ reminisce about most is my family. They opened my eyes to the truth. It wasn't\
  \ just about seeing castles and lakes, it was a glimpse of a new life, a simpler\
  \ one focused on family and happiness. I had always hoped to see where my grandparents\
  \ call home but I didn't expect to connect so viscerally to my newfound family that\
  \ saying goodbye moved me to tears.  I've learned to not fear new people but instead\
  \ to truly listen to and experience what they have to offer. If you ever get a chance\
  \ to explore your heritage, I urge you to do it. You will discover a new self and\
  \ just might find a piece of you that you didn't know was missing."
