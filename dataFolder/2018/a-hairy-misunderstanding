Text: "\u201EYou have to cover up your shoes or go barefoot,\u201C one of our groupmates\
  \ explained.\nI was staring at my feet wondering about how I should cover up my\
  \ flip-flops with these plastic things she pointed at. \n\u201EUrg, I should have\
  \ put on shoes for that,\u201C I said to my sister who then just decided to go barefoot\
  \ inside of the temple we were about to visit.\nIt was one of the options we had\
  \ for the day in Bikaner, the second stop of our three-week trip in northern India.\
  \ When our travel guide explained all options back in the hotel, my sister and I\
  \ decided to join our travel mates to the \u201Ered temple\u201C, which was at least\
  \ what we understood. \nLater on, I learned that the building called Karni Mata\
  \ Temple is a holy place for the people in this country.\nNaked on my feet I lined\
  \ up next to my sister to get access to the inside of the temple.  \nThe line led\
  \ us to something I considered as an inner courtyard, which ground was constructed\
  \ with black and white squares. Despite our burned skin, nohing in here was red.\
  \ Was is just the outside? How stupid that I had not pay attention to that.\nBy\
  \ slowly moving forward, I looked down to my left and spotted something which made\
  \ me really upset.\nGrabbing my sisters hand but without taking my eyes off the\
  \ not so tiny shapes, I whispered in her direction, \u201CCaro look, there are rats!\u201C\
  \ \nBut like if they were caught up at something they hided back to the shadow,\
  \ running over themselfs. When I was about to look up to see my sisters reaction,\
  \ I caught a glimpse of the inside of the temple and what I saw then left me spechless.\
  \ It was not just the two, the whole place was full of rats bigger than our feet.\
  \ Surprised I turned my head around and saw right into my sisters face, who just\
  \ stared back at me with a horriefied look.\n\u201EDidn\u2019t you say it is called\
  \ the \"red\" temple?\u201C I asked.\nWe were staring at each other, still holding\
  \ hands and then could not help but laugh. We simply misunderstood one word and\
  \ did not notice it until we stood right in between the rats. How typical for us!\
  \ \nAmused by our own stupidity, we overcame our inhibitions to tiptoe forward inside\
  \ of the building, making sure not to step into the stinky excrements or - even\
  \ more important - on the worshiped creatures. They were not shy at all! \n\u201E\
  I can not wait to tell dad about our bad english skills,\u201C my sister giggled\
  \ while she unpacked the camera.\n\u201EYeah,\u201C I laughed,\u201Cand to wash\
  \ my feet!\u201C"
