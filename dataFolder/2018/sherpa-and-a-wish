Text: "\u2018Dheere Dheere chalte rahna\u2019 (keep walking slowly), He said and his\
  \ tiny body caring a 22lbs sack disappeared behind the huge bolder. I was stood\
  \ to grasps the oxygen and my lungs were pumping rapidly to support my effort in\
  \ the thin air. He is young, as young as his city pals who are yet to attend their\
  \ high school. His eyes were deep and smile was so innocent that we could trust\
  \ upon him anytime. \n\nI was exhausted completely, the chilling wind with sweaty\
  \ undergarment makes my situation more miserable. Last night I was almost awake,\
  \ the bittering cold often shiver in my spines and nocturnal hypoxemia keeps me\
  \ awake most of the part of night. We started today's trail after sun came out.\
  \ In front of me waves of boulders, barring my each steps. But I knew this was the\
  \ final hurdle I need to manage, I knew there is a heaven waiting out there after\
  \ this. \n\nIt was my long-time dream, a well-kept wish to reach the final destination\
  \ \u2013 The base of highest mountain in the Himalaya.  The unparalleled beauty\
  \ of Mother Nature keeps me in daydreams with yak bells jangle and flaking vertical\
  \ prayer flags.\n\nFar across, I can imagine a small hut in a base of gentle stream\
  \ and a middle aged women, making chapatis for her younger offspring. As my little\
  \ friend narrate his story of his family. His elder brother never came back from\
  \ the deadly blizzard few years earlier ferrying load in a high pass, still they\
  \ don\u2019t have much choice. I know the earning from the season will kept their\
  \ kitchen warm till the snow melts and route opens again for tourists next year.\
  \ Often it happens for few pennies extra, load take tolls to these mates, even sometimes\
  \ only to keep promise to their city agents. For us it is touching the dream, but\
  \ for them the way of life. I can clearly visualize how a wish and a survival can\
  \ coexist in same journey, same destination.\n\nI choose to back in mountains always\
  \ but maybe they don\u2019t."
