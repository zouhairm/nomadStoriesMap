Text: "Paris. The well-known city of Paris. The city of light. The city of love. That\
  \ was all I knew when I arrived there for the first time in 2013. First time in\
  \ France, first time in Europe. And if magic exists, as an old lady full of wisdom\
  \ and mystery, she definitely walks through those old narrow streets and such a\
  \ breathtaking architecture.\nAfter four days in that amazing city I got in touch\
  \ with max, a friend\u2019s brother, and my only contact in Paris. He suggested\
  \ going to the cinema. I thought that would be great! It was an Almod\xF3var film.\
  \ With French subtitles and Argentinian actors. I couldn\u2019t deny. So he gave\
  \ me the address of his shop, to go and fetch him the day after. \n\u201CSaint Honor\xE9\
  \ 20\u201D, the paper with the address said. Well, I found the street and it looked\
  \ like a piece of cake. I walked until I found the address, but, to my surprise,\
  \ there was no shop there. I had Max\u2019cell phone, so I tried calling him from\
  \ a phone booth. But I reached his voicemail. I waited and called him several times,\
  \ but got no answer at all. \nOoops. What could I do? He might had written the number\
  \ wrongly but I couldn\u2019t check with him. So then, I suddenly remembered that\
  \ the night before at the bar, there was this guy called Perlim, who was Max\u2019\
  \ boss. So, he would definitely know the right address. He had given me his card\
  \ in an attempt to flirt with me and I was very happy to have kept it. So, I called\
  \ Perlim\u2019s mobile, but even though I speak good French, he was speaking very\
  \ fast and the line was breaking, so I couldn\u2019t really solve the address problem.\n\
  Discouraged and in despair, I headed the subway to go back to the hotel. Bye movie,\
  \ bye Almod\xF3var. The last thing I expected was to find Perlim going out from\
  \ the turnstile. Yes. He was miraculously going out at the very same time I was\
  \ trying to get in. Wow. That was insane!\nOf course he gave me the right address\
  \ and I could finally go to the movies with Max. The film was hilarious. But what\
  \ called my attention the most was this unexpected ending. Particularly, because\
  \ this guy, the one who \u201Csaved my day\u201D was humorously called \u201CPerlimpinpin\u201D\
  \ by his friends, which evokes a magical powder used in kid stories. And that, my\
  \ friends, seeing Perlim\u2019s face in the overcrowded station of Ch\xE2telet was\
  \ a magical moment for me. So be careful, if you happen to go Paris, because you\
  \ have \u201CRue Saint Honor\xE9\u201D, but you also have \u201CAvenue Saint Honor\xE9\
  \u201D. Tricky, right?"
