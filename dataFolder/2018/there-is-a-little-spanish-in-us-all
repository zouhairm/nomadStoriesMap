Text: "Us gypsy folk are a little irresponsible when it comes to having enough money\
  \ in the kitty to finance our travels.\n\nMany of us have been there at some point\
  \ and I won't promise I won't go there again - travel bankruptcy that is, Mine ultimately\
  \ led me to my spirtual home Galicia. \n\nI was lucky enough to have aupaired two\
  \ beautiful little Spaniards in Galicia, the north of Spain for six weeks before\
  \ setting off on my bicycle or bicicleta in Spanish. I cycled that stunning country\
  \ like it was nobody's business stopping by the beaches of A Coruna, then the end\
  \ of the famous Camino Santiago de Compostela, Vigo, Pontevedra, then onwards to\
  \ Portugal's Lisbon, Oporto and then to the South reknowned for it's party vibes\
  \ in Cadiz, Sevilla, Granada and Almeria.\n\nIn two months I had seen and felt what\
  \ it was to be part of the Spanish lifestyle and I hadn't even hit Barcelona yet.\
  \ I had fallen in love with the country, its food, scenery and its people. Emersing\
  \ myself in a culture that is so different to my Kiwi upbringing was a unique experience\
  \ and looking back one of the best things my soul has experienced.\n\nIf all my\
  \ travels across Europe (and I have been back many times now), I look most fondly\
  \ at my time in Galicia. I was in a small town called Oleiros across the bridge\
  \ from A Coruna where I was a live in aupair with who I now call my Spanish family\
  \ of Javier, Suzanna, Alex and Miguel. I am in constant contact with them four years\
  \ on and believe I will be for life. I long to go back for them and for the culture.\n\
  \nThe Spanish have a fantastic life balance, where fun and family come first and\
  \ work is purely to fund it. From what I saw there was no huge emphasis on material\
  \ things, that so many of us get caught upwith. No, the biggest focus for those\
  \ in the northern part of Spain was what time will we go to the beach and what can\
  \ we pack for lunch.\n\nI have never met such generosity. Every evening there would\
  \ be new local produce for me to try and boy did I become addicted to the jamon\
  \ (or ham). Suzanna made the best paella I will ever try and the Galician cheese\
  \ wheels are something my waistline hated me for and my taste buds adored. Galicia\
  \ is also known for Tortilla, a potato and egg delicacy I have since not been able\
  \ to replicate. I was in heaven, Spanish heaven and often try to keep that Spanish\
  \ flame ignited inside me while operating in the world of duties and bills.\n\n\
  In only six weeks I felt like a local and found my spiritual home in Galicia Spain."
