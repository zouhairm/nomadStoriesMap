Text: "I took a seat in the waiting room at the Winston Scott Polyclinic in Bridgetown\
  \ Barbados, to see the results of my tuberculosis test. As I glanced around the\
  \ room, I noticed the man sitting in the chair across from me was staring very intently\
  \ at me. I shifted awkwardly in my seat, avoiding eye contact until he spoke to\
  \ me. \"I'm making you uncomfortable, I know, but you have freckles.\u201D \n\n\
  He was tall, perhaps in his early 40s, with dark ebony skin and dreadlocked hair\
  \ tucked under a grey tam. He wore jeans faded from the sun, a broken pair of sandals,\
  \ a weathered green shirt, and a long beaded necklace. To my unsophisticated eyes\
  \ at the time, he was vastly intimidating. I was debating whether I should respond\
  \ or politely ignore him to continue playing \u2018flappy bird\u2019, but he got\
  \ up from his chair and came to sit beside me. I locked my gaze with his and realized\
  \ I may have been wrong about his age, there was a limitless wisdom and depth in\
  \ his pupils I had never seen before. This stranger masterfully began to engage\
  \ me in a conversation about the origination of freckles. He spoke with enthusiasm\
  \ and charisma that rid me of my initial anxiety. I began to feed back into the\
  \ dialogue various details about my personal history, and he responded with fervoured\
  \ interest. \n\nAfter I listened to his rambles for almost 20 minutes, he let himself\
  \ slouch back in the chair while crossing his arms in front of him, \u201CYou know,\
  \ you show the same power as the original Eve. The world should be wary of you and\
  \ all that you are destined to change.\u201D The nurse opened the door to the observation\
  \ room, and called out my name for me to come forward. I stood up, and my stranger\
  \ did too. I turned to him and grinned, \u201CWho are you?\u201D \n\n\u201CMy name\
  \ is Emmanuel. You have great strength, enjoy your journey.\u201D Then he turned\
  \ on his heel and sauntered off down the hallway humming a Soca tune with a little\
  \ dance in every step. \n\nThe nurse asked me if I had known the man I was talking\
  \ to, I replied with a no, and asked her if he had already seen the doctor. The\
  \ nurse allowed herself a smile, \u201CNo sweet pea, he showed up about 15 minutes\
  \ before you sat down. I watched him talk to you and now he\u2019s gone.\u201D I\
  \ told her his name and she went deep into thought as she read over my tuberculosis\
  \ results, \u201CEmmanuel...hmm, God is with us. Well, God is with you today young\
  \ lady; you\u2019re tuberculosis free.\u201D I walked away from the clinic that\
  \ day, free of disease, electrified with curiosity. I never saw Emmanuel again."
