Text: "I fell in love with the idea of Cuba - a place closed off, that I knew so little\
  \ about. I used to stare at the island on a map and plan some impossible trip. When\
  \ flights were announced from the U.S., it turned into an improbable reality. I\
  \ prepared myself the best I could: I learned Spanish; read history books; and skimmed\
  \ travel guides in bookstores. I still wanted to keep a sense of spontaneity and\
  \ discovery so I left my itinerary blank.\nI flew into Camaguey, a spot on the map\
  \ I knew nothing about. I arrived at 4 p.m. and outside the airport I crammed into\
  \ a local bus, guagua,  heading into town. I took a random bus stop and walked out\
  \ onto an unsuspecting neighborhood next to a train station. The last train already\
  \ left so I found another guagua to the eastern edge of town.\nWhere the Carretera\
  \ Centrale, spaning across Cuba, meets the eastern edge of the beltway around Camaguey\
  \ there is a punto amarillo, which provides a meeting point for hitch hikers and\
  \ drivers. I arrived at dusk, sat on my bag next to everyone, smiled and lit a cigarette.\
  \ A girl my age, Junia, introduced me to her friends, and they agreed to get me\
  \ get all the way to Las Tunas - halfway to Santiago on the coast. We hopped into\
  \ the back of a cattle truck and raced into the coming night. I don't know how far\
  \ we got before our ride ended, but it was dark and there was only a petrol station\
  \ in sight. Junia, her friends, and I put some money together and Junia walked under\
  \ a street light, strut out her leg and fanned out the money. The act garnered attention,\
  \ but not the results we wanted. \nAfter an hour, a tarp covered camion slowed down\
  \ for us. The tobacco truck had been converted into a make shift bus and was filled\
  \ with people headed east along the carretera. I saw matching gym bags with the\
  \ Cuban flag wedged in the front. When Junia and I sat behind them, we discovered\
  \ they were part of the Cuban National Women's Baseball team heading home from a\
  \ tournament abroad. Some of the team were going all the way to Santiago, so I said\
  \ goodbye to Junia at Las Tunas and rode onward.\nEvery town we passed where a baseball\
  \ player got off had a crowd of people cheering with signs no matter how late. Sometimes\
  \ a bottle of rum made its way to be passed around inside the camion too. The night\
  \ ride hummed on and I fell asleep. One of the coaches and the last two players\
  \ on board woke me up; it was 3 a.m. and I had made it all the way to Santiago.\
  \ And the best was yet to come."
