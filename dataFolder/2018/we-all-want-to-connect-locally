Text: "Every traveler seems to want to meet new people and experience other cultures\
  \ on their journeys \u2013 in short; we all want to connect locally. However, how\
  \ do you actually define what it means to make a local connection?\nDoes it mean\
  \ you move in with a local for a year, abandon your native tongue, and commit to\
  \ do only as the locals do? Or, can it be as simple as finding an authentic meal\
  \ or having a chat with a local at the pub? The difference is in the depth of relationship\
  \ that you build based on the amount of time you have.  Whether you have one day\
  \ or one year, every interaction is a connection to what it means to live in a place.\
  \ Is one experience really better than another?\n\nAs a traveler \u2013 or even\
  \ worse, as a tourist \u2013 it can be very difficult to come face-to-face with\
  \ the normal, day-to-day life of a place, especially if faced with barriers of language,\
  \ culture and ethnicity. Having been lucky enough to spend a year living in an Indian\
  \ community, I have made some particularly good friends. India has always been on\
  \ my wish list of countries to visit, but I\u2019ve never felt 100% comfortable\
  \ about travelling there as a female on my own. I met many people who had been to\
  \ India and they seemed to either love it or hate it. I wasn\u2019t ready for it\
  \ at the time \u2013 but now that I\u2019ve finally visited, I wonder why I waited\
  \ so long. I can say that I definitely love India \u2013 and I can\u2019t wait to\
  \ go back!!!!\n\nThere are many different ways to see India: everything from do\
  \ it yourself backpacking to the opposite end of the scale, flying from city to\
  \ city and staying in luxury 5-star accommodations. I actually started my time in\
  \ Delhi staying at a 4-star property and spent time visiting a number of higher\
  \ end hotels just to see the difference in service and comfort. I\u2019m so glad\
  \ I did as it\u2019s given me a much better idea of the different levels of service\
  \ available. If it\u2019s in the budget, splurging on a nicer place is a great option.\
  \ \nFor my actual travel time I was fortunate to take part in a comfort small group\
  \ trip. This meant private transfers between cities; small, basic but comfortable\
  \ 3 star properties; and having a fantastic guide to assist us all through the 8\
  \ day trip. For me this was the perfect introduction to India and all it has to\
  \ offer. The people are beautiful and friendly, the food was fantastic, and there\
  \ are so many different options as far as levels of comfort go that there\u2019\
  s an option for every budget and comfort level!"
