Text: "An excerpt:  \"I\u2019m not sure anything could have prepared me for the extremes\
  \ of human experience on display in Port-au-Prince. All is presented in striking\
  \ contrast. There are the business people in high fashion clothes, bold prints,\
  \ bright colors, crisp, and ironed, walking the streets, carefully avoiding rubbish\
  \ piles, and stagnant water. There are the people taking a sledgehammer to a pile\
  \ of rubble to remove the twisted rebar. While, Ferraris navigate the hills of Petionville,\
  \ the colorful Tap-Tap\u200A\u2014\u200Aa painted pick-up truck\u200A\u2014\u200A\
  serves as the main form of public transportation, swerving in and out of traffic.\
  \ Commuters hang off the back, as if riding a trolley. I saw children throwing rocks\
  \ at the wild dogs, while others, in matching school uniforms, walk hand in hand.\
  \ \n\nEvery busy street is a market, where men and women set up \u201Cshops\u201D\
  \ on a portion of the narrow sidewalk. Products available for purchase street side\
  \ range from socks to auto parts to tropical fruits. In downtown Port-au-Prince\u200A\
  \u2014\u200Aclose to the presidential palace\u200A\u2014\u200Athese street shops\
  \ are larger in size, with one proprietor taking up a half a city block. The backdrop\
  \ of these shops were ruined facades of buildings destroyed by the 2010 earthquake.\
  \ To my eyes, the damage was still raw, exposed, and painful. But daily life moves\
  \ forward, and merchants integrate the jagged walls into their displays like a post-apocalyptic\
  \ vendor fair.\n\nTraffic came to a dead stop on the only road into town. This was\
  \ a regular occurrence. It was approximately a four-lane road, but cars were packed\
  \ in five deep, inching past each other in a game of cat and mouse. Somehow, hoards\
  \ of motorcycles weave through this mess. Pollution poured through the open windows\
  \ of our Land Rover with no air conditioning. The Tap-Tap slowly lost customers\
  \ who determine they are better off walking. It is dark. My eyes, throat and lungs\
  \ start burning after an hour passes of direct pollution inhalation. Before us,\
  \ a Haitian couple is sitting across from each other in the bed of the pick up truck,\
  \ stopped in traffic. Like many others, they are impeccably dressed (suit jacket,\
  \ tie, dress, heals). They look relaxed. They are flirting, smiling, talking in\
  \ hushed tones. I imagined them sharing an intimate table for two in a swanky Manhattan\
  \ eatery. They wouldn\u2019t look out of place. The world around them seems bleak\
  \ to my foreign eyes, but to them, this is a Tuesday.\""
