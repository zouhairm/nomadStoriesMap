Text: "In the summer of 2017 on a trip in the south of Spain, as I was witnessing\
  \ one of my prettiest sunsets on the top of a sand dune which meets a forest and\
  \ then the Atlantic I was filled with the excitement of discovery. The same evening\
  \ returning to Cadiz my travel buddy and I decided to take the first ferry to Tangier.\
  \ The moment I step foot in the port of Tangier, the entire scene has changed, it\
  \ was as if we were put in a twisted time/society machine, our surroundings felt\
  \ entirely different and on the top of that it was a totally new continent. We were\
  \ thrilled begin our adventure within the walls of Tangier. As we started walking\
  \ for the city a local joined us in our walk. First, we were a bit suspicious, we\
  \ passed through little streets that seemed like a labyrinth, Hisham seemed a bit\
  \ too helpful. In the hostel we asked for some tips before beginning our discovery\
  \ of this new city, but we didn\u2019t know that the journey had already begun.\
  \ We were in the set of a film played numerous times. Hisham was waiting for us,\
  \ before we had the time to think we started to walk with him as he was telling\
  \ us our itinerary. We found ourselves in the market crammed with people in which\
  \ our guide knew a lot and they all treated us very kindly, they offered us some\
  \ local street foods. It was a Friday, a special day for Muslims, and people were\
  \ dressed in traditional robes. Hisham said that because we are Turks we were going\
  \ to get discounts everywhere and we just wanted to believe It. We then started\
  \ climbing across the narrow streets of Tangier filled with children playing, through\
  \ the colorful Jewish quarter up to the walls. On our way back, we arrived in the\
  \ cloth market, everything happened so fast, we were being offered countless options\
  \ without having the time to think; which made things so immersive. We bought some\
  \ Moroccan cashmere. Hisham next brought us to drink Moroccan tea in a local caf\xE9\
  \ where literally everyone was smoking keef from a pipe. We were offered to buy\
  \ some hash realizing slowly that we were in a game. Later Hisham brought us to\
  \ a traditional restaurant of which the owner took us upstairs to a hall with no\
  \ other customers and offered us a feast of delicious Moroccan food. The hash dealer\
  \ reappeared, offering lower prices which we finally accepted. We ended the evening\
  \ on the rooftop of our hostel that had a great view of the city. Although we spent\
  \ six times what we had planned to the Tangier experience with locals was worth\
  \ living."
