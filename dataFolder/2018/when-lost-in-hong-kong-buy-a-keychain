Text: "The sun hung half-mast between a sprawl of fishing boats, painting lines of\
  \ pink where its reach still touched. I walked the promenade along the bay, somehow\
  \ managing not to choke on the errant tapioca bubble that had lodged in the straw\
  \ of my milk tea. \n\nI'd lost myself in Hong Kong earlier that day. My sense of\
  \ direction is something of a running joke. It's the reason Hong Kong's MTR appealed\
  \ to me; branching into every territory, the train provided efficient and thoughtless\
  \ travel. Missing one train meant a two minute wait for the next. Buses are different.\
  \ Having lived in small town America all my life, I had yet to internalize something\
  \ so instinctual for city dwellers.\n\nBoarding the wrong bus was almost a certainty,\
  \ and one I exploited well. I'd apparently decided I was going to Stanley rather\
  \ than the Geopark. Tourists flocked to the stalls while I regarded the market with\
  \ a wariness befitting one entering a bear cave. My tastes tend to stray toward\
  \ hiking, but I shrugged and supported the local economy until prolonged close contact\
  \ chafed at my skin. I escaped to the bay to watch the setting sun. \n\nThe half-lidded\
  \ sun at last closed its eye, leaving boats as shadows upon equally murky water.\
  \ Lights blinked sleepily into existence from the slanted roofs of each stall, and\
  \ with reluctance I returned to the market, obliged to buy at least something. Ignoring\
  \ vibrant \"Love HK!\" stalls, I stepped into the calmer din of a local woodcutter.\
  \ My fingers trailed idly over the zodiac, the three wise men, Buddha.  Finding\
  \ nothing, I'd entertained the dreaded thought of visiting one of the tourist shops\
  \ when my hand paused. I rubbed my thumb over the intense face of a pig, its teeth\
  \ bared as it rode upon the back of a carp.  I held it for a long while, then checked\
  \ the price.\n\n\"You made a good choice,\" the shopkeeper said.\n\n\"Did I?\" Curiosity\
  \ overcame a rare impatience. \"What does it mean?\"\n\nFlipping the keychain over,\
  \ he pronounced the characters laid bare before the lantern above us.  He then translated:\
  \ \"May you have safe travels, wherever you may go.\"\n\nHe wrapped the keychain\
  \ in paper, ignorant of my stunned silence.  With my affinity for spontaneous detours,\
  \ much could have gone wrong. Had the bus driver been less kind. Had I passed a\
  \ less than welcome crowd. Yet, here was a keychain I'd chosen at random, wishing\
  \ me safe travels as though knowing how lucky I'd been.  It could have been encouragement,\
  \ or a warning.\n\nI'd just liked the look of it."
