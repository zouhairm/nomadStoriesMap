Text: "I climbed down from the station platform and looked across at the barrio. \n\
  \nThe Lower West Side, a suburb of Chicago is home to a small Mexican community\
  \ called La Villita. This community clings to their culture. The local festivals,\
  \ family-owned grocery stores, and Mexican restaurants that use authentic recipes,\
  \ generations old, are what has kept this neighborhood from losing its charm. \n\
  \nIn a vast warehouse, normally the turf-covered home to community soccer clubs,\
  \ vendors have set up for the 6th annual Tamal y Atole Festival. The bouncing sound\
  \ of the banda bleeds out into the street, a hand gesturing at me to \"come inside,\
  \ enjoy the festivities\". \n\nMy eyes adjust as I step into building and the smell\
  \ of the sweet corn masa enters my nostrils. Queues of people tangle together as\
  \ they wait to taste the \"Best Tamales in Chicago\". Dozens of vendors have lined\
  \ up along the perimeter under pop-up canopies, each with several massive hot pots\
  \ of the deliciously steamed dough wrapped in corn husks. As soon as one steaming\
  \ pot empties, someone immediately brings a new one balanced gingerly on one shoulder,\
  \ somehow navigating the excited crowds to resupply their temporary shop. \n\nI\
  \ wander through eager lines of wide eyes taking it all in. Most of the vendors\
  \ have traditional tamales filled with chicken or pork, while some have opted for\
  \ sweet fillings like pineapple or cream.  As I wander the maze, another vendor\
  \ offers a thick, buttery drink. The warm Atole has a pungent scent of vanilla and\
  \ cinnamon. I have no problem waiting in line to try the delicious wares each vendor\
  \ has to offer. It's getting dark by the time I leave, wandering back through the\
  \ neighborhood toward the train station, I can see the other party goers walking\
  \ along the sidewalks back to their nearby homes. This is a place where people are\
  \ proud of where they come from and they are happy to share it. \n\nUnlike other\
  \ festivals and markets that have become gentrified and comfortable, this festival\
  \ stays true to the culture of its people. Whether you travel to a distant country\
  \ or a neighboring state, you will find a local connection if you are open to it.\
  \ Find the communities that are proud of their history, you will find the greatest\
  \ adventure here, just outside of your comfort zone."
