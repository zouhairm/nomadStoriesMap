Text: "On a stormy, autumnal afternoon we made the pilgrimage to the best, local onsen\
  \ we knew. Situated on a hill, the onsen overlooks an industrial Nagoya city. We\
  \ arrived around 4 in the afternoon - manoeuvring our way through the vending ticket\
  \ machine and parting with 500Y each before entering the onsen zone. We made our\
  \ goodbyes and arranged a time to meet post-onsen experience. \nI ducked through\
  \ the \u201Cladies only\u201D curtains and headed into the bustling changing rooms.\
  \ After quickly undressing and beelining to the onsen itself I was greeted by a\
  \ large, steaming room full of different pools. Just as an aside - I had heard there\
  \ was an electric bath but was certain there would be signage and warnings. I spent\
  \ time in the main, large pool before sampling a jet pool, outdoor and a large calcium\
  \ pool in which the water felt incredibly soft. I made my way to a deeper jet pool\
  \ - I sat down by the jets - feeling the blast against my skin. After being thoroughly\
  \ pummeled by the water - I spotted an older lady sitting in what appeared to be\
  \ a rest spot... I headed over feeling relief at seeing a wide submerged seat. On\
  \ sitting back, just an inch, I felt a twitch run along my back, jerking up I pretended\
  \ not to be shocked and tried sitting back down again. This time there was a definite,\
  \ jarring electric current. Fully naked I leapt back - much to the amusement of\
  \ my older companion who began laughing (in a kind way). We got chatting and in\
  \ very broken English/Japanese I was able to explain that I didn\u2019t like electricity\
  \ in water - she, on the other hand, was fully seated in the current and was so\
  \ relaxed and comfortable. We chatted further and she proceeded to invite me to\
  \ her home for dinner with her family. In the theme of \u201Csaying yes\u201D on\
  \ my trip - I said I would love to and my partner and I were treated out to a lovely\
  \ local sushi restaurant with this lady and her family (husband, daughter and granddaughter).\
  \ Our visit to Nagoya ended shortly after but we still remain in contact on Facebook\
  \ - and would love to see each other again where possible. I feel so grateful to\
  \ meet such kind, personable people - despite the language barrier we created a\
  \ friendship we would love to see last."
