Text: "I adjusted my goggles, replaced the scarf over my mouth and hooked my ski poles\
  \ over my wrists. I Waddled up to the edge of the trail and wondered if anyone looked\
  \ at me and silently judging the blatant \"novice\" vibe I was giving. It was only\
  \ my second day of skiing since coming to New Zealand, and although I had caught\
  \ on quite quickly, I still had very little control over my speed and movements.\
  \ The line behind me was steadily growing, so I stopped procrastinating and pushed\
  \ off. The wind whistled in my ears, and the cold air hit the tiny strip of exposed\
  \ skin where my scarf had slipped from under my goggles. I skied fairly fast, my\
  \ muscles ached from the turns I was attempting, my body ever tense in preparation\
  \ for a fall. I came around a tight corner and fed off the adrenaline the run was\
  \ giving me. The sound of the snow scraping against my skis was one I had learned\
  \ to love. I had finished the first difficult part, and now had an easy decline\
  \ to take a break before the next section. I felt an intense cramp in my left hip,\
  \ so I very slightly lifted my foot to stretch it out. My ski got caught and I flipped\
  \ forward, face first into the snow. My skis came undone from my shoes, and my poles\
  \ went flying as I tumbled down the mountain. I skidded to a stop, laying like a\
  \ starfish, waiting for the pain of a broken limb to surely start showing. After\
  \ a couple of minutes I deduced I was just fine, and sat up to start the difficult\
  \ job of retrieving my skis. I looked up the mountain for them, and saw a skier\
  \ collecting my skis, poles, and even my beanie as they made their decline. They\
  \ skidded to a stop and pulled off their mask, before handing me my belongings.\
  \ \"You were looking good there before that big fall.\"\n\"People always think I've\
  \ been skiing for years, but it's only been two days. Funny how you can look so\
  \ put together on the outside whilst you're screaming internally.\" \nHe laughed\
  \ and said, \"Isn't that life though? The people who seem the most \"put together\"\
  \ are usually the ones with the most issues. Standing at the top of the hill everyone\
  \ has the same thoughts, 'am I going to fall and break a limb? Or am I going to\
  \ ski right off a cliff?' No one knows what's waiting for them down the bottom,\
  \ or how their journey is going to go, but we all push off anyway don't we?\" \n\
  \"I suppose you're right.\"\nHe winked, \"You don't suppose, you know.\""
