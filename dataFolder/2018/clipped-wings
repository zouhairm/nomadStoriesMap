Text: "\u201CYou better clip her wings before she flies away.\u201D\n\nThe words buzzed\
  \ in the back of her mind like a mosquito itching for its next draw of blood. She\
  \ swatted the thought away and drew her attention to the speed they were gaining\
  \ down the winding back roads of Spice Isle. Her stomach was turning uneasy from\
  \ the jolting stops of the tour van, but she was appreciative of each tree that\
  \ their Grenadian guide introduced and the local pride that inflated his enthusiastic\
  \ speech.\n \nThe trees boasted their bounty of spices and fruits. Each tree seemingly\
  \ breathing in the guide\u2019s proud words and sparkling with self-worth.\n \n\
  Crumbling houses sat scattered among newly built structures. The guide pointed to\
  \ a two-story concrete house in shambles. Hurricane Ivan devastated the island over\
  \ a decade ago, severely damaging over 80% of the country. The sliced-open remains\
  \ were now home to several plants. Strings of green leaves created shields over\
  \ the collapsed concrete. The branches were heavy with rich spices but they grew\
  \ high in triumph.\n \n\u201CResilience,\u201D smiled the guide. The leaves fluttered.\n\
  \ \nNot an ill word was spoken about Grenada, she noticed. The guide even said that\
  \ the prison at the top of the hill is filled with people who just wanted a free\
  \ ride to the prison\u2019s peak view of the island.\n \nShe thought about her own\
  \ life back in the States. How many moments had she let drown in stress or frustration\
  \ when all she needed to look for were the green leaves growing through the cracked\
  \ concrete? She thought of herself. The doubt in herself. The guide never doubted\
  \ a tree\u2019s significance.\n \nDriving through town, several men whistled and\
  \ shouted \u201CBeauty!\u201D as they passed by. She was squished in the front seat\
  \ between the door and her partner. The guide looked over to her partner saying,\
  \ \u201CYour girl is getting quite a few looks around here. Why aren\u2019t you\
  \ married yet?\u201D\n \nHer partner defended the relationship explaining that they\
  \ were young and taking their time. At age 23 and 24, there was no rush to tie the\
  \ knot.\n \nThe tour guide jested, \u201CYou better clip her wings before she flies\
  \ away.\u201D They all laughed.\n \nShe couldn\u2019t help but hear the buzzing\
  \ mosquito carrying the weight of that comment zip back into the forefront of her\
  \ mind. Her wings were no one\u2019s to clip. Her wings were hers to spread as far\
  \ as possible. Go as far as possible. The pride of Grenada and dignity of the spice\
  \ trees surged within her. And she will go far, she thought to herself."
