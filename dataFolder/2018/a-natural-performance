Text: "Witching hour finds me on a mossy Lakeland rise, the air chilled with odours\
  \ of leaf-drop. My borrowed lens seeks out the milky smudges and silvered pinpricks\
  \ collaged across the draped dark while Ben\u2019s soft hues narrate the skies,\
  \ gifting insights of long-ago and far-away. This nocturne casts me in a performance\
  \ of a forgotten vernacular. Act One: the bloodied blade of a bushcraft knife; sharp\
  \ arts of notching, shaving, sharpening on oiled gritstone. The eternal eclipse\
  \ of the kill a visceral reminder of red-clawed nature. Mirroring Ben, neck wrung,\
  \ carcass pierced with blade then finger, heart and breast ring-pulled skywards\
  \ sliced and seared over smoky flames, with wilted nettle tips, freshly picked.\
  \ My blood-blackened nails and frost-finger stings persist long after the earthy\
  \ tang. Act Two: the masterful ease of a wildwoodsman parodied by apprenticed fatigue.\
  \ Tacit wisdoms on friction in Lime, Hazel, Wild Rose honed into architecture of\
  \ bow-drill, spindle and hearth. Kindled muscles beget an alchemic ember; a will-o'-the-wisp\
  \ transmuted to gold on knife-curled birch tinder, preciously dry. Ben\u2019s exhaled\
  \ breath over unhurried smoulderings of smoky green, my watchful stillness a silent\
  \ wish. A flared Whoosh! is spiritual reward for my toils and a promise of warmth,\
  \ food and tall-tales in dark shadows. Act Three: days cold in the early light;\
  \ for some, a frigid rousing in the night-cold camp shower. Fire-warmed shelter\
  \ from nagging midges and other harms; my chiselled Willow whistle a child's toy\
  \ until Roy points out that its toot, achingly shrill, could save my life one inky\
  \ night. A Sycamore spoon sculpted smooth, its purpose rendered on a soupy harvest\
  \ of wild mushrooms: peach-scented, saffron-scorched chanterelles, squat grassy\
  \ ceps, woolly milk caps with their gluey ooze. Heather, knowing and well-named,\
  \ ensures we avoid \u2018their eternal sleep'. Rubbed glassy with a quiet thumb,\
  \ spoon and whistle rest in a pocket as palpable evidence of my endeavours. Six\
  \ years since I was in these sceptred lakes, feasting on the hovering capstones\
  \ and riven depths, hosting one-pot suppers and supping hoppy essences. At some\
  \ point, I up-scaled exotically, boots ruddied by the muds of the Okavango and seasoned\
  \ by limpid Bolivian salts. Back here, now, this hushed and sparkling space is a\
  \ reconnection to treasured familiars of wet viridian, moonlit drystone and tea-dunked\
  \ biscuits. A realisation that my path back is not a finale, but an unfolding motif\
  \ of my wayfaring."
