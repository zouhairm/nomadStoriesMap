Text: "A Walking Tour of A Medieval City: Finding the Unexpected in Prague\n\nOn the\
  \ train from Munich after a week of beer, sausages, and pretzels at Octoberfest,\
  \ I thought I'd top it off the trip with a visit to Prague.\n\nOld Town Square\n\
  \nMy feet are feeling sore. The soles of my worn Converse tennis shoes\nare letting\
  \ me know it. I feel like I've covered every cobblestone street over two days to\
  \ see Wenceslas Square, the Charles Bridge, Prague Castle with St. Vitus Cathedral\
  \ looming large over the landscape, and the Astronomical Clock. Prague is a city\
  \ made for walking, the best way to see the Old Town Square area and beyond. Plus,\
  \ every little side street holds transports you back to the 19nth century.\n\nKafka\
  \ Museum \n\nGo down a stairway by the Charles Bridge and onto Mala Strana street\
  \ and you'll be close to the Franz Kafka Museum. But it is easy to walk by it, and\
  \ the only indicator is a fountain with two green sculptures of men peeing. Inside\
  \ the museum, Kafka's artistic \"Metamorphosis,\" so to speak, is on exhibit. The\
  \ standout is a dim hallway with black file cabinets, some with video installation,\
  \ you can pull out and see various works the author wrote. But what you learn is\
  \ what a constant source of inspiration Prague was for him.\n\nThe Sex Machine Museum\n\
  \nOld Town Square and Astronomical Clock is the Sex Machine Museum, although it\
  \ is also easy to miss. Located at Melantrichova street, the museum entrance is\
  \ painted all in red and teems with activity. I flippantly comment on how busy it\
  \ is and the churlish girl behind the counter says \"well, people really seem to\
  \ enjoy it.\" \n\nAfter paying 10 euros, I sit in a chair straight out of some carnival\
  \ scene that lights-up to measure my apparent sex appeal. I have to admit that I\
  \ chuckled at that. However, the real exhibit begins with a life size sex doll behind\
  \ glass then the entrance to a small cinema that shows some of the first adult movies\
  \ ever made. From there, there are three floors to explore every oddity created\
  \ in the quest for sexual pleasure. It's not until you get to the last floor, however,\
  \ that you see all manner of \"machines,\" one of them being a stationary bike with\
  \ an added attachment. No need to comment as the old adage \"some things are better\
  \ left to the imagination\" applies here.\n\nThe point here is if you only have\
  \ a few days or less in Prague, don't spend your time on just the common sites.\
  \ Make sure you treat yourself to something unique you'll always remember and may\
  \ even laugh about."
