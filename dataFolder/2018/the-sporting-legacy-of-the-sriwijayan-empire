Text: "12 goals. 2 choreos. 5 pyro shows. 3 fights. 1 pitch invasion. Ugly Palembang,\
  \ the major Sumatran inland port, offers little for casual-sexing backpackers and\
  \ hipster bloggers. The drab city lacks tourism. Locals never see foreigners. My\
  \ pale skin and big nose got me a lot of unwanted attention when I attended a match\
  \ of local Football club Sriwijaya FC. Opponents Persegres, already relegated, lost\
  \ 10-2. But the highlight was the young, riotous fans. To our right; hordes in black\
  \ battled with the police who struggled to contain incoming fans. Gold and black\
  \ A3 sheets were distributed around me as a giant banner unfurled and pyrotechnics\
  \ fizzed. Great acrid smoke stung the nostrils. A chorus of defiance for 90 minutes;\
  \ legions of the young and hopeless of Palembang taking the chance to be heard.\
  \ At full time, they continued to try and score against the police, fists and feet\
  \ invading the hallowed turf. Fans brawling against fans, smaller boys and girls\
  \ dashing for cover. Most Indonesian Football enthusiasts are usually volatile,\
  \ hormonal, rash teens. The result is a fan culture that is exceptional; compelling,\
  \ punchy and vibrant. The attendees sing, sway and clap to a raw celebration of\
  \ the city by those who try not to think about tomorrow. It is behaviour you will\
  \ never see at Old Trafford or The Emirates. Other travellers can lie to themselves\
  \ about \u201Cmeeting the locals\u201D, laying hungover in hostels playing Tinder\
  \ with their compatriots. I am the one making local connections in the environment\
  \ that these locals care about the most; their Football stadium. But there is more\
  \ to Sriwijaya FC than pyro and riots. Palembang was the former home of a medieval\
  \ empire for 800 years. This empire took advantage of its strategic location within\
  \ the Straits of Malacca, between wealthy centres of power from Africa to China\
  \ via Persia, to profit from the transport of goods using the region\u2019s seasonal\
  \ monsoons. Its merchants sailed from one location to the next, buying and selling\
  \ goods ranging from ivory to nutmeg, marking up prices along the way. Favourable\
  \ connections with the ruling Chinese helped bring the empire to prominence, putting\
  \ other regional maritime merchants at a disadvantage. This Sumatran empire grew\
  \ ever more powerful until the emergence of the Mongol Yuan Dynasty broke access\
  \ to discounted Chinese goods and changed the course of Sumatran history forever.\
  \ Javanese armies overran the Empire in the 13th century. That empire\u2019s name?\
  \ Sriwijaya of course."
