Text: "\u201CMake sure you hold hands wherever you go\u201D Mum says, seeing us off\
  \ at the airport. I look at my sister and laugh, but the look on Mum\u2019s face\
  \ is dead serious, despite us being practically middle aged.\n\nMy sister gives\
  \ my hand a little squeeze and says \u201Ceverything\u2019s going to be fine\u201D\
  . I roll my eyes and groan. I shouldn\u2019t have told them about seeing a therapist.\
  \ I was expecting high fives for getting professional help to deal with crowds;\
  \ I got patronising hand-holding instead.\n\nWe arrive in downtown Tokyo to complete\
  \ sensory overload: all encompassing, utterly mad and absolutely wonderful. We excitedly\
  \ explore everything at once, going from place to place in a total frenzy. After\
  \ our millionth time exclaiming \u201Coh my gosh look at THIS!\u201D exhaustion\
  \ hits hard and it\u2019s time to head to our hotel. \n\nSmall (ok huge) problem\
  \ - it\u2019s peak hour. I think back to all the Tokyo documentaries I watched leading\
  \ up to our trip and recall that the footage of Shibuya Station Masters physically\
  \ cramming people into train carriages was the slap in the face that made me go\
  \ to therapy. That\u2019s where we're headed to right now. I suddenly can\u2019\
  t swallow. My sister grabs my hand and leads us into the depths of the subway.\n\
  \nI brace myself for the chaos that is a peak hour crowd. But this Tokyo crowd is\
  \ a different beast to what I\u2019m used to: everybody is moving in the same direction,\
  \ quietly, peacefully. The orderliness of this horde makes me uncharacteristically\
  \ calm and before I know it I\u2019m flowing into the train, my sister a step behind.\n\
  \nOnce inside, the train is full to the brim but whisper quiet. The doors shut and\
  \ I turn to face my sister but she is not the person behind me. The train starts\
  \ moving and I spot her face, a couple of people back from the doors, still on the\
  \ platform. She gives me a sad little wave as the train pulls away.\n\n\u201COH\
  \ NO!\u201D\n\nMy lamentation is as involuntary as it is loud, cuts through the\
  \ silence of the train and echoes along the length of the carriage. Nobody looks\
  \ at me. I don\u2019t know where to look or what to do and for a moment I think\
  \ I may lose it.\n\nI get out at the next stop and try to not get swept along with\
  \ the crowd heading towards the exit. I head to the wall and stand with my back\
  \ to it, knowing my sister will be along on the next train. The platform empties\
  \ out as I wait. For a brief moment I am all alone in a city of nine million people\
  \ and it feels worse than any crowd I\u2019ve ever encountered. \n\nMum was right.\
  \ We should\u2019ve held hands."
