Text: "The horizons were dark and the soil beneath my feet damp and loose.\nA local\
  \ was calling out everyone to witness the Theyyam performance that happens in Payyanur,\
  \ Kerala every once a year. It was a spectacle like no other.\n\nIt was four in\
  \ the morning when I woke up to the sound of the door banging loudly.\nA local man\
  \ held a torch in his hand and led me to the back of an open truck and gestured\
  \ me to get on. The ride was bumpy but then slowed down on approaching a large temple\
  \ decked in oil lit lamps.\nI walked in with the other locals alighting from different\
  \ trucks and followed the crowd to the temple. \nOn almost entering the door, I\
  \ heard the sound of a Harley booming across the paddy fields that surrounded the\
  \ temple. \nI looked back and saw a tall and built man, with tattoos of red and\
  \ black, get off the bike and walk toward the back of the temple. \n\nI was shocked\
  \ at the sight but also very curious. \nConch shells started playing from inside\
  \ and the performance would begin soon; so I rest my thoughts for a while and enter\
  \ the temple. \nMats were spread on the ground for people to sit on and I picked\
  \ a good spot up front. \nA drum started beating at the back and two other drums\
  \ joined. The women started howling at the back and I turned startled.\nThe lights\
  \ turn on and I hear a pair of anklets walk onto the stage. I turn around to see\
  \ a huge man dressed in a striking red costume, heavily mirrored headgear and fearsome\
  \ face paint. It was the same biker!\nIt is the story of Lord Narasimha they said.\
  \ The singers start chanting the hymns and the dancer starts moving his head and\
  \ torso in a circular fashion. He places one foot at a time like treading over a\
  \ stone path laid over a turbulent river and excites the winds with his hands shaking\
  \ and asking for rain. \nThe show ended with a violent death and a sense of repent\
  \ in the antagonist. The lights were out and the music dies slowly. The people start\
  \ getting up to receive their prasadam and I walk toward the dancer. In the corner\
  \ room behind the stage, all the priests sat around the man and took turns blessing\
  \ him and giving him the sweet of God. \n\nI walk back to my truck amazed by this\
  \ man and the cultures that permeate through this land. I looked at my inked arm\
  \ and where I stood that moment. It is amazing how one can feel belonged by the\
  \ smallest of instances."
