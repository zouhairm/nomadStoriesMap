Text: "When I was planning my six week solo trip to India, couchsurfing with a relative\
  \ stranger in the middle of the Thar Desert was never at the top of my \u201Cto\
  \ do\u201D list. \u201CCouchsurfing\u201D in and of itself is a generous term: when\
  \ I say we were sleeping in the desert I mean exactly that - we drove around the\
  \ dunes until we found a flat enough spot, laid our blankets on the sand, used our\
  \ packs as pillows, and relied on the moon to light our way as we wandered up and\
  \ down the undulating hills. If you asked me a year ago if I'd ever do this I'd\
  \ say you were wild, but there was something about Mithali and her spirit for adventure\
  \ that inspired me to take a chance. \n\nJaisalmer, also known as the \u201CGolden\
  \ City,\u201D is a state in the Southwestern region of Rajasthan that isn't too\
  \ far from the Pakistan border. It's known for its magnificent fort, which was built\
  \ over eight hundred years ago and consumes the surrounding flat desert landscape.\
  \ Among backpackers, Jaisalmer is known as the place you go in India for the best\
  \ camel rides around. As a first time solo female traveler I knew I wanted to do\
  \ a camel ride but was apprehensive navigating negotiating it with camel jockeys\
  \ on my own, so I decided that I'd go with the safe route and book a tour. \n\n\
  I was in Pushkar for a week before I headed the eight hours west, and during that\
  \ time I met Mithali, a fellow 27 year old who was on holiday from her hometown\
  \ of Jaisalmer. You don't meet a lot of Indian women who travel on their own, so\
  \ when she and I started talking I was intrigued to get to know her. One day over\
  \ thali and chai we were talking about Jaisalmer and I asked her if she\u2019d ever\
  \ done one of these infamous camel rides. She chortled and told me, \u201Cyes, but\
  \ if you really want a real experience of my city you have to sleep in the desert.\
  \ That's what me and my cousins would do when we were growing up. Hey! Let me take\
  \ you out one night to show you.\u201D \n\nMithali's earnest excitement to show\
  \ me a more authentic side of her city inspired me to scrap my plans and do this\
  \ overnight stay with her. My first night in Jaisalmer we went out to the Thar Desert\
  \ around sunset and set up a fire. It wasn't like we needed it - the full moon lit\
  \ the desert up with a muted underwater blue filter so bright that we could see\
  \ everything clearly. We set our alarms for 4:30 AM to see the stars once the moon\
  \ had set, and when we woke we laid in our blankets and oscillated between sleepily\
  \ staring at sun rising in the horizon and dozing off again as the day began to\
  \ heat up."
