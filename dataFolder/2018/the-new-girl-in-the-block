Text: "Tales of the Mughal Empire and East India Company loom in the air the moment\
  \ she landed in Delhi. Her eyes never got tired applauding what a remarkable work\
  \ the British architect Edwin Lutyens had done with this place. But today, it will\
  \ not be about our pasts or futures. This time it will be about her. \nLittle did\
  \ it occur to me that standing in front of the book store in Dariyaganj, the experience\
  \ will influence me so much. \nSurrounded by massive heaps of books, she was the\
  \ girl whose eyes were filled with excitement, a girl who span when she wore a brand\
  \ new dress. She knew nothing of tragedies. Sadness never made its acquaintances\
  \ with her. She was the girl with an ear to ear smile, spreading life into the lifeless.\
  \ \nLooking around, she observed the place carefully. I could not keep myself but\
  \ noticing her although I was already occupied and thoughtful which books I was\
  \ to buy today. \nHer mom stood in a corner letting the girl to explore as much\
  \ as she wanted. She had a little time before it gets night and they had a tight\
  \ schedule. I concluded from their conversation. \nShe held the books with eagerness\
  \ and kept moving on, placing the books carefully back into the shelves. But with\
  \ one book, she stood reading the blurb and I could not wait to know her more. I\
  \ approached her.\n\u201CI would recommend it to you anytime. The protagonist never\
  \ ceases to surprise me.\u201D\nShe smiled a smile to me and that moment, I knew\
  \ I had not read anything like this in the books or movies. \n\u201CThe books are\
  \ expensive though.\u201D She replied honestly.\n\u201CYes but 200 INR per kilogram\
  \ books shouldn\u2019t be too much for an avid reader, I guess.\u201D\n\u201COh\
  \ my God, they\u2019re not 200 INR per book? Are you serious?\u201D\n\u201CExactly,\
  \ the banner says so.\u201D\n\u201COh no, I got confused. I will have to do my rounds\
  \ again now. Thank you so much.\u201D\nAnd there she was. Just like that, the excitement\
  \ came back to her face. This time I did not disturb her. In her head, she still\
  \ did the calculations. I could hear her babbling to the books in the most promising\
  \ manner that she will come back for them. The lazy days were gone. She was elevated\
  \ as ever. \nShe cherished every moment of it. Observing her from a distance, I\
  \ picked up a book for myself. Not everyone gets to see such enthusiasm every day."
