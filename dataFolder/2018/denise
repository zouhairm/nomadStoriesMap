Text: "The sticky heavy Louisiana heat hit me as the cab door opened. I was dropped\
  \ off at the only place I could think of: Caf\xE9 Beignet on Royal Street.\n\nIt\
  \ was 10am, and the New Orleans French Quarter was already full of other tourists.\
  \ With my faux alligator carry-on and a backpack stuffed to full capacity, I stood\
  \ out. My friends weren\u2019t getting in until 8pm, preventing me from checking\
  \ into the Airbnb they had booked. This left me with at least 10 hours to explore\
  \ the city on my own. \n\nResisting the iconic pastries, I proceeded to waddle aimlessly\
  \ around the Quarter with my luggage. The worn and decadent architectural details\
  \ of a Spanish and French heritage bewitched me as I passed. Cast iron galleries,\
  \ reminiscent of vintage black lace, gleamed against happily colored stucco facades.\
  \ \n\nAs I bummed my way down Decatur street, passing beignet eaters with a preference\
  \ for Caf\xE9 du Monde, I heard her: \n\n\u201CBaby! Baby! What are you doing?\u201D\
  \n\nShe called to me from the door of a tiny yellow building. \n\n\u201CYou look\
  \ homeless carrying all those bags! You tryna\u2019 get robbed?\u201D\n\nI paused\
  \ long enough for her to pull me inside a tiny office. \n\nHer name was Denise.\
  \ \n\nAllegedly born in the kitchen of a famous plantation home, Denise was a Cr\xE9\
  ole of Color who proudly inhabited the Crescent City. She earned a living giving\
  \ tours of the Quarter\u2019s haunted locals, and pulled out a stack of pictures\
  \ to prove her contact with the other side. Glowing white spheres surrounded a dancing\
  \ couple in period dress. The lady dancer looked an awful lot like Denise; the young\
  \ man in the tuxedo was her son. She informed me that the spheres were \u201Cspirit\
  \ orbs,\u201D and the picture was taken when they were extras in a movie. \n\nDenise\
  \ lived outside of NOLA for a short period, right after Katrina. Since her return\
  \ to the \u201Crehabilitated\u201D city, rent had gone up. She had moved into a\
  \ tiny apartment with shoddy air conditioning, and it was getting harder to make\
  \ ends meet. Meanwhile, my Airbnb was just one of the many renovated homes listed\
  \ in a formerly working class neighborhood.\n\nAfter some time chatting, Denise\
  \ called her contact at the H\xF4tel Place d\u2019Armes (one of the stops on her\
  \ tour). She arranged for the hotel to hold my bags until that evening. \n\nBefore\
  \ my send off, I received a hug and a reminder to drink lots of water.\n\nDenise\
  \ had a vibe, an eccentric warmth. That same warmth radiated from all the good folks\
  \ who took me into their city, and made me wonder who NOLA would be without them."
