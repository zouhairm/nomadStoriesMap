Text: "Well there I was all laid back and having nothing to care about,food was put\
  \ on my platter,all was taken care of.Until now, I decided that it was enough and\
  \ it's time to throw myself out there.Without giving a second thought I decided\
  \ to pack my bags and make my own way all by myself.Got my tickets done and the\
  \ day finally arrived.I was excited.Tucking away my emotions in a corner I embarked\
  \ on a journey far from home.I was still unsure of my decision and with each step\
  \ I felt doubt getting the better part of me.But still I moved ahead because that\
  \ was what I had been longing for all those years.I boarded the train,my old man\
  \ came to see me off.Well the bright eyed guy of nearly 60 years showed no sign\
  \ of emotions infact he was brightened up probably due to the fact that his boy\
  \ has finally taken his stand.I was again burdened by a bag handed over to me by\
  \ my father,the bag contained some traditional food items much delightfully savoured\
  \ by people from my tribe and that must have been mom's way of saying farewell son.\n\
  \  So I boarded the train,laid my luggages to rest,just kidding.Finally the train\
  \ journey kicked-off.My co-traveller we're all ladies except for two hunking dudes\
  \ who would munch on food every now and then.The ladies were very kind to me as\
  \ they kept on offering me food each time they ate,for a couple of times I denied\
  \ but as I felt my denials piling up I didnt want them to perceive of me as a rude\
  \ guy, finally I loosened myself up a bit and like the shameless brat I used to\
  \ be during my childhood accepted their kind gesture.They seemed to be from a very\
  \ humble background and had left home in search fro greener pastures.We talked and\
  \ giggled and finally after two nights and two days of journeying their destination\
  \ had arrived,I was courteous enough to escort them till the door.We bade farewell\
  \ and wished the best for each of us.I was now all by myself and to beat the boredom\
  \ I had to resort to buying myself a bottle of whiskey which the attendant stored\
  \ secretly lest a thirsty passenger should spring by.Owing to the fact that I am\
  \ a music fanatic by heart and soul I didn't feel lonely anymore accompanied by\
  \ booze and wonderfully mastered masterpieces from the 80's and 90's that crafted\
  \ the face of music.\n After a night and day of enjoying my own company I reached\
  \ ernakulam,a train station in Kerala,an Indian tropical coastal state,also called\
  \ 'God's own country's.I finally reached Alleppey next to which was The Great Backwaters\
  \ of Kerala."
