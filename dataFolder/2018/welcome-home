Text: "I\u2019m writing this days after returning from Senegal.  This excursion was\
  \ originally set as a vacation and I ended up being moved, physically, morally and\
  \ spiritually, to an extent so profound that it awakened my sense of culture and\
  \ history, restored my love for writing and afforded me a clear path of focus which\
  \ was the last thing I expected to experience.  I came back with an understanding\
  \ that my progression is about amplifying my instincts.\nTraveling has been a part\
  \ of my upbringing.  By having the opportunity to explore different environments,\
  \ encounter new languages, dialects and accents and from being exposed to various\
  \ cultures, I created myself.  I was adopted at 2 years old and to this day am unaware\
  \ of my specific ethnicity and roots.  I yearn to find connection to my physical\
  \ characteristics, ideologies and behaviors which travel has aided me in.  This\
  \ was my third time visiting Africa, but it was the first time I became aware of\
  \ the intersectionality between Africa and African Americans as it relates to our\
  \ inherit culture.  On Goree Island, an island which housed slaves during the Trans\
  \ Atlantic slave trade, I was overwhelmed by locals who picked up choice phrases\
  \ in English (they knew many other languages as well), in order to connect to Westerner\u2019\
  s in hopes of making a sale for the day.   The same few people trailed me during\
  \ my 7 hour visit and knew my name in a matter of seconds.  I was impressed with\
  \ their persistence, annoyed with the pressure to buy something, yet fascinated\
  \ at the way these people adapted to and retained knowledge from those they were\
  \ surrounded by with such ease.  Nevertheless, after failed attempts to communicate\
  \ with me in French or Wolof and concluding I was American, one phrase remained\
  \ consistent: Welcome Home.  I am now more aware that my culture is rooted in communication\
  \ (verbal and non verbal), story telling and survival.\nI met other young travelers\
  \ who were backpacking, working on Ngor Island as surf instructors or simply visiting\
  \ as I was while listening to live music by the pool of  the hotel\u2019s outdoor\
  \ entertainment area.  These connections, paired with my own sense of solace from\
  \ being in Africa, relit a passion inside of me that had burned out years ago. \
  \ I felt an urgency to use my words to express my travel experience and my new sense\
  \ of focus and understanding of self.  This trip reconfirmed my need to live as\
  \ my true self by amplifying my instincts.  Engaging in writing again helps me live\
  \ my best life."
