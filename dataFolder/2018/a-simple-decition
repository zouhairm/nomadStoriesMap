Text: "I believe in two ways of ending up in the very edge. First, you make a simple\
  \ decision and you think it's normal decision like many others. Second way, it's\
  \ when you make a decision very quickly because of lack of time!\nThis story is\
  \ about first variant when a simple decision brough me to the very edge. It was\
  \ the kind of the edge that transformed my inner and outer world. I always wanted\
  \ to travel, to see the world, to get to know different nations and their cultures.\
  \ So when I saw advertisement for job on a cruise ship to decide what to do was\
  \ very easy. \nThe ship seemed for me an affordable, adventurous opportunity to\
  \ travel, to improve my English and on top of that to earn some money. Later I understood\
  \ it was a mirage. But I believe that it helped me to extant myself beyond of what\
  \ I though I was capable physically and psyphologycally.  \nFirst you face totally\
  \ different environment. I'm talking about metal machine around 300 metres long\
  \ and 12 decks high. You just keep getting lost between the corridors with cabins\
  \ and decks. And your cabin looks is like a luxurios wardrobe in term of space two\
  \ metre on two metre. Yes, exactly, forget about privacy! Your emotions and verbal\
  \ languagde are in sight. Onboard you don't have space to run, hide and cry. So\
  \ just one way is to be tough and at the same time don't go in conflict with other\
  \ nations. I figured out that the best way to do it is do not implement your rules\
  \ and ways of doing things. Just follow local ship rules and not question it. Plus\
  \ to all, you are working up to 12 hours. In addition you always get numerous trainings.\
  \ Maybe when I describe this people think that they can't do it. Trust me a lot\
  \ of us able to do this and even more! For example, like parties, every break run\
  \ to the beach, have a drink at the crew bar,  plus to all these activiies my favourite\
  \ was a gym. Besides there is also opportunity for a romance! But be ready that\
  \ crew will talk around about it. \nI hope this story doesn't sound scary! It's\
  \ actualy very positive. Looking back I think about myself as a superhero who could\
  \ manage a lot of things in one day. I was teached how to be safe, professional,\
  \ how to love and respect others. My inner borders are extended and filled in with\
  \ new experience and opportunities. All of that would never arrised if I didn't\
  \ make that simple decision to travel and work on the ship. It's wonderful feeling\
  \ when you overcome yourself and mooving to your dream!"
