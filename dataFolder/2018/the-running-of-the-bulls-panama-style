Text: "My husband and I spent seven winters on Isla Taboga, Panama, where we immersed\
  \ ourselves in the life of a small, authentic Panamanian village. Each year, we\
  \ chose one off-island destination to explore. Roughly the size of South Carolina,\
  \ Panama delighted us with its varied micro climates and cultures. In verdant mountain\
  \ villages, cooler than the lowlands, life is slow and easy. The farmers of the\
  \ Azuero Peninsula live much as they did 100 years ago, offering a glimpse into\
  \ the past. Mangrove jungles filled with monkeys frolicking in the trees overhead\
  \ leave one wondering who is observing whom.\n\nThe year we decided to visit the\
  \ western part of the country, we headed west on the Panamanian Highway in a rented\
  \ Toyota Yaris with 65 miles on the odometer. Once we passed Santiago, hitherto\
  \ the farthest west we had ventured, the highway changed from a four-lane, smoothly\
  \ paved road to two rough, potholed lanes. Broken slabs of cement shifted and rumbled\
  \ like wooden planks under our wheels. We followed locals who knew what they were\
  \ doing to avoid trashing our rental car.\n\nFurther west, we noticed that cars\
  \ heading toward us were flashing their lights. Figuring it was the international\
  \ signal for \u201Ccop up ahead\u201D we sent telepathic gracias\u2019s as we slowed\
  \ down. But when a Panamanian cowboy on horseback, galloped by on the right shoulder\
  \ of the road frantically waving a red flag, we were stumped. As we crested the\
  \ hill, we saw a sizable herd of big Brahma bulls, cows and calves, drooling, snorting,\
  \ and running straight toward us, kicking up dust in their wake. \"Stop!\" I screamed,\
  \ not trusting these bovines to move to the shoulder and march in a single file.\n\
  \nThe cows surrounded our car. One with wide, frantic eyes and long streams of drool\
  \ looked right in my window, fogging it up with his cow breath. A young calf made\
  \ a beeline for the grille of our car and actually made contact. Bam! We heard and\
  \ felt the impact. I instinctively reached for the door handle to see if he was\
  \ okay, despite cows with heads bigger than my torso just outside. \u201CStay in\
  \ the car, Irene!\u201D said Dan. (Good idea.) We backed up slowly and... no calf.\
  \ Others were sniffing the front of our grille but the calf had ambled off.\n\n\
  Once the path was clear, we slowly moved forward until we found a safe place to\
  \ check the damage. Dan got out and looked but, amazingly, there was not a scratch!\
  \ I was worried that the little guy had a headache. But at least we didn\u2019t\
  \ have a huge damage deposit to pay!"
