Text: "We had broken down on one of the long yellow roads in Midlands Province, far\
  \ from any of the mining towns with their cut-up man-made landscapes of gauged cliffs\
  \ and rubble-mountains, far - thank God - from the enchanted siren-laced Nyanga\
  \ mountains with their lush deep-green which surreptitiously hides the ghosts of\
  \ the people who entered and never emerged, far from Gweru with its banks and supermarkets\
  \ and jacaranda trees and all the surrounding little hills - rounded or pointed,\
  \ individual as breasts.  \n\nWe climbed boulders to find signal, but to no avail\
  \ - the sun was high in the sky, and some of us lay like lizards on rocks while\
  \ others stood watch for passing cars. \n\nAnd yes - after some time (who can tell\
  \ the time at times like these?) a truck came along, a truck carrying hundreds of\
  \ mangoes, and the driver stopped. We explained that we had a flat tyre, we tried\
  \ his phone to see if it had signal, but no luck. So we abandoned our jeep and got\
  \ into the back of his, amongst the heaped and leaping mangoes. His name was Nyasha\
  \ (God's-gift), and as we trundled along he played the radio. The songs that always\
  \ played were 'Hello' by Adele, and 'Disappear' by Winky D, and we sung along. Ugh,\
  \ it was hot. Yes, Nyasha said, and that was because Nyami the river-god hasn't\
  \ struck us for years - all the river beds and the ground are dried up\u2026 \n\n\
  Of course, it was a coincidence. Probably. Or it was one of those beautiful moments\
  \ which hover just between serendipity and divine providence and you don't even\
  \ want to dwell on it, you're too happy to ask questions. Because it started to\
  \ rain. Yes, really. Great lashings of cool cool rain which quickly obscured the\
  \ roads and the boulders and made the world look how it does through eyes full of\
  \ tears. We laughed and whooped as we hurtled through the blurry landscape.\n\n\
  As an apricot sun sunk and began to melt across the sky and behind the boulders,\
  \ we reached a road-side stop - one of those surprise clusters of shops and a few\
  \ houses and an outdoor bar with a faded 'Coca-Cola' painted huge and red on the\
  \ wall. The mango man bought bread and plantains. He brought out a little grill\
  \ and lit a fire inside, and suddenly there was a new colour in this black-and-white\
  \ night, a colour as glowy as mango flesh, a colour which danced gently and romantically\
  \ and then melted down below the lines of the grill. He sliced a plantain deftly\
  \ in the almost-dark and he placed each coin on the fire to soften it and bring\
  \ out the sweetness."
