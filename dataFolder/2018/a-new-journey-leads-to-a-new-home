Text: "There is an infamous saying by the Roman philosopher Gaius Plinius Secundus\
  \ that says \u2013 'home is where the heart is.' it is indeed so. I would rather\
  \ spend time in the comfort of my home where I can sit back and enjoy myself. I\
  \ have travelled to a few cities and towns within South Africa and some have really\
  \ stuck with me: the people, the mood that lingers and just the town itself. That\
  \ was when I realized that home is not just one place. It can be numerous places\
  \ caught up in one \u2013 the heart. In August 2016 I fell in love with a beautiful\
  \ soul who was born in the Northern Cape province of South Africa. Later that year\
  \ in December my now boyfriend, Levert and his family invited me to join them on\
  \ vacation as they headed home to the town, Warrenton, where his grandparents spent\
  \ the last years of their lives. I was anxious due to the fact that I was born and\
  \ raised in the Western Cape province and has never travelled outside its borders.\
  \ Nevertheless, I looked forward to joining them on their journey. As we travelled\
  \ from town to town the air became dryer, the earth red and the galaxy seemed to\
  \ have dropped. I could count the stars without the help of my specs. I was amazed\
  \ by the stretched out landscapes covered in dry brown almost dead grass. The endless\
  \ mountains paved our way forward to our destination. For me it was a different\
  \ world. The people were much more humble than those back home. Even though we shared\
  \ the same language the way they speak sounded different. Soon preparations for\
  \ Christmas started as jolly spirits and laughter accompanied. My boyfriend\u2019\
  s family welcomed me into the comfort of their home. The weather was not the way\
  \ I know it. It was out of the ordinary. One moment you feel the sun burning right\
  \ through the roof and the next moment a thunderstorm strikes without any warning.\
  \ And I am not exaggerating. Still I loved being there. Petrichor. The rustic smell\
  \ of the ground penetrated my lungs as the rain poured down on it and I felt oddly\
  \ very grateful at that moment. Soon it was the dawn of the New Year and in celebration\
  \ the locals prepared scamby \u2013 a local homebrewed beer. Do not misjudge the\
  \ power of scamby. It will have you dancing and later tumbling over your feet. I\
  \ have witnessed it. Two weeks have flown by and again it was time to pack up and\
  \ leave. While placing my bags into the car I gazed around and a strange saddening\
  \ feeling came over me. That is when I realized that I have made a local connection.\
  \ I\u2019ve a new found home."
