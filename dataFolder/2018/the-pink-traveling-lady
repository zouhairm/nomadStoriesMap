Text: "I was walking down a busy street of Florence, with a friend, fighting through\
  \ the hubbub. It was a warm, sunny afternoon with a mellow, lemon-yellow tinge all\
  \ around. I was particularly overwhelmed by the sublime work of art, David, by Michelangelo,\
  \ that I had seen in the morning and we both distinctly felt that the city transmitted\
  \ an ethereal vibe of artistic emotion. It was the kind of place where you start\
  \ knowing that you, as a human being, is an art in itself, that throbs, pines, dances\
  \ and flows timelessly. Around that time, suddenly she arrived, almost like a breeze.\n\
  \nShe was dressed in pink from head to foot. She had painted her face in white.\
  \ She had Bohemian jewellery, complete with a veil and headband. There were other\
  \ people around who were disguised as statues and stood on either sides of the road\
  \ but she was different. She was an art in motion. She was bubbling and bursting\
  \ with life while spreading some strange joy around. She was almost like one of\
  \ the statues coming alive, except dressed in colours. In no time she was holding\
  \ our hands and saying, \u201CPhotu, photu!\u201D\n\nBoth of us separately clicked\
  \ pictures with her. She also pouted adorably while posing with the man I was walking\
  \ with. We tried to strike up a conversation but unfortunately we didn\u2019t know\
  \ her language and she didn\u2019t know ours. We smiled, she giggled animatedly\
  \ and thus exchanged unsaid words.  She exuded such energy and rhythm in all her\
  \ movements that we were pleasantly amused. We couldn\u2019t understand her ethnicity,\
  \ race, religion and language. Yet we interacted organically, the way human beings\
  \ used to do thousands of years ago. \n\nWe both were students and didn\u2019t have\
  \ enough money to donate. So at the end, when she forwarded her palm expecting,\
  \ we had to nod our heads to say no.  She didn\u2019t complain. She vanished in\
  \ the thin air within moments and curiously we could not see a trace of that vibrant\
  \ pink anywhere. \n\nI often remember her like a strange and exotic dream, like\
  \ a morning breeze, like an exquisite art. I often remember her like I remember\
  \ David, from that same city. While I upload her picture on Facebook and tell others\
  \ her story, she has probably changed her colour and face and her bright shade of\
  \ pink to be another art in motion, roaming uncannily around the streets of Florence."
