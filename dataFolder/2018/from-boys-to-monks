Text: "When two of my students came to me one day saying they would be missing two\
  \ weeks of class, and wouldn\u2019t be able to complete any of the homework I was\
  \ about to assign, I was suspicious. It was no surprise that they didn\u2019t want\
  \ to do it, they were eleven-year-old boys, but I couldn\u2019t possibly let them\
  \ fall two weeks behind.\n\nThey quickly assured me they wouldn\u2019t be allowed,\
  \ or even have time for homework as they were going to live in a temple as monks\
  \ for the duration of their absence. Now I was intrigued.\n\nIn Thailand many men\
  \ choose to spend time as a monk at some point in their life for a variety of different\
  \ reasons and periods of time. It is an extremely honourable thing to do, not only\
  \ for oneself but also for one\u2019s family.\n\nThey explained that they would\
  \ be novice monks, unable to become a fully ordained monk until adulthood. Nevertheless\
  \ they would be living in the temple among other monks and participating in the\
  \ same everyday activities. They would spend their days practicing silent meditation\
  \ and prayer, collecting alms, and studying the principles of Buddhism. I had many\
  \ questions, and sensing my interest they invited me to come to visit them in the\
  \ temple for the morning prayers and collection of alms.\n\nThey gave me directions\
  \ to the temple and I arrived just as the sun was rising. Many of the others who\
  \ had woken up at 06.30 to give alms to the monks were very curious as to what I,\
  \ an obvious foreigner, was doing at a temple so far off the beaten track. I explained\
  \ that two of the novice monks were my students, and found myself flushed with pride\
  \ at the devotion and maturity these boys displayed as they took on the role of\
  \ a novice monk.\n\nWith their freshly shaven heads, striking orange robes, and\
  \ bare feet they were hardly recognizable as the young energetic boys I was so used\
  \ to seeing in my class. They walked with purpose as they collected the early morning\
  \ donations of food, the only food they would eat that day. As the monks circled\
  \ the temple I dropped bananas, bread, and juice boxes into their baskets.\n\nThe\
  \ morning ritual of collecting of alms in the form of food and donations is not\
  \ seen as charity, but a spiritual act that connects the community to the monasteries.\n\
  \nOnce back in class, it took weeks for their hair and eyebrows to grow back. A\
  \ constant reminder of their time as monks and the remarkable transformations I\
  \ saw in each of them. A reminder that some of the most educational experiences\
  \ in life cant be taught in school."
