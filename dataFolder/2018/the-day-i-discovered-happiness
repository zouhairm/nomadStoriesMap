Text: "I- like most other people I know- travel to escape the monotony and stress\
  \ of everyday life. I can leave my job, my worries and burdens behind for a brief\
  \ yet well needed breath of fresh air and a new outlook on what it means to truly\
  \ feel alive. \nI knew heading to Nicaragua I was in for the trip of a lifetime,\
  \ but what I didn't realize going in was that the most memorable experience was\
  \ going to be  the one I would have least expected.      \nThe island of Ometepe,\
  \ located within the Lago Colciboca is truly heaven on earth. It is a small island\
  \ with towns built around two volcanos, with beaches of black lava sand and warm\
  \ waters. Lush vegetation covers almost every foot of this magical island, with\
  \ insects and animals I'd only ever seen in textbooks.\n     We had heard rumblings\
  \ around town of a party deep in the jungle down a dark road, far from any other\
  \ bars or hotels and decided to check it out. The walk into the jungle was long\
  \ and pitch black. Guided by nothing but a wimpy phone flashlight and the distant\
  \ pounding of dance music- we made it. \n     The party was nothing spectacular,\
  \ mostly other Canadians getting drunk and sharing their adventures. My friend and\
  \ I decided to take a walk further into the jungle to create our own adventure.\
  \ \n   Another pitch black road through the trees, but this time I noticed something\
  \ different. A colony of lightning bugs were swarming in the grass seemingly lighting\
  \ the path for us! I was so excited as I had never witnessed them in the wild. As\
  \ we continued down the path we reached the waters edge. At first it was silent,\
  \ but as my ears adjusted I could hear the chirping of the crickets, the crashing\
  \ of the waves on the rocks and leaves rustling in the breeze. Again I could see\
  \ all the lightning bugs around us glowing in the night. Then I looked up. There\
  \ were more stars in the sky than I could even dream of, all twinkling. I felt an\
  \ immediate wave of peace wash over me, like nothing I had felt before. This was\
  \ the most connected to mother earth I had ever been.\nI had been struggling long\
  \ and hard with depression in the years prior, and had a hard time remembering what\
  \ pure bliss felt like. For the first time in ages; i was happy. Truly and honestly\
  \ happy. Who knew that something so simple could resonate so deeply within. \nIt\
  \ wasn't the moment I would have expected to make the biggest impact on me, but\
  \ to this day I still smile when I think of that beautiful island and the joy it\
  \ made me feel."
