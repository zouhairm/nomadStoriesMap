Text: "I started travelling a lot when I got 18 and became legally permitted to do\
  \ it on my own. When I was younger, I could not indulge my passion for travelling\
  \ that much, so I went to art school, learnt languages and played tennis. One day\
  \ I started a new chapter of my life - Irish dancing. I was born in Kazakhstan and\
  \ it was a very strange choice of pastime for the girl from my country. There was\
  \ not a single shop to buy the needed equipment. Therefore when my friends invited\
  \ me to join them for a trip to Ireland, my heart almost stopped beating. What it\
  \ meant was that I would finally buy the hard shoes!  Preparing for the trip, I\
  \ found a shop in Dublin that specialized in this kind of stuff, chose a model I\
  \ wanted and was already dancing treble jig in my mind. The plan was to spend two\
  \ days in Dublin and then leave it and go all around the country enjoying its rural\
  \ landscapes. \n\nIt is hard to describe Kazakh people as the most hard-working\
  \ ones, but the shops in my country are open 7 days a week. We got to Dublin on\
  \ Friday night\u2026a moment of drama. I travelled thousands of miles to buy a pair\
  \ of hard shoes, but the shops were closed. Bad luck. On Sunday night we had to\
  \ leave the city. \n\nThe journey to our next destination was long and we were travelling\
  \ on a tourist bus. Halfway through we stopped to have a break. The driver, an old\
  \ Irish man, came up to me and asked about something. We started a conversation\
  \ and by its end he new my story. \u201CYou do Irish dancing? I did it too when\
  \ I was your age. Don\u2019t worry, you will get your shoes\u201D. He made a phone\
  \ call. \u201CWhat is your size\u201D, he asked me during our next stop. \u201C\
  36\u201D, I whispered with my eyes full of surprise. \u201CPerfect! My niece called\
  \ all the shops in the nearest cities and there is one in Cork. We will go to Cork\
  \ while the tourist group will be on the excursion around the park\u201D, he smiled\
  \ in the most optimistic Irish way. \n\nHe drove me to another city, found the shop\
  \ and I made my long-awaited purchase. No way there was any person happier than\
  \ me on that day. I could not expect anything like that for sure. \n\nThis great\
  \ deed of the driver reassured me that kindness and compassion does exist and it\
  \ is around us. It is shown in the small and big things and it makes our lives better.\
  \ I am extremely lucky to have experienced such a thing and I hope that one day\
  \ I will help someone as much as the Irish driver helped me. \n\nP.S. I won a number\
  \ of competitions in my shoes and I dedicate it to that driver from Ireland."
