Text: "One week in and I was ready for a change. I was consistently experiencing the\
  \ exhilarating fast paced and busy streets of Kao San Road, Bangkok-a street that\
  \ truly never sleeps. It was a combination of New York City and New Orleans, streets\
  \ at night turning into dance floors filled with faces from all over the world.\
  \ Not a day went by without scorpions, exotic insects, balloons, night shows, Muay\
  \ Thai fights, and buckets. \n\nPai, Thailand-surrounded by hot springs, the Grand\
  \ Canyon, waterfalls, and bungalows. It was the town where I learned to ride a motorbike,\
  \ slept in an open bungalow with mosquito netting, walked along dangerous mountain\
  \ edges, and fell asleep with the harmonizing tunes of toads and insects. \n\nI\
  \ had anticipated the relaxed flow of this town: yoga, plant-based diets, less artificial\
  \ noises and more blends of nature, and hippies. The days filled with outdoor activities\
  \ while the nights revealed the town's secrets. \n\nBy sundown the first night,\
  \ I came across the \"Don't Cry Bar.\" The owners of this bar were not your typical\
  \ Thai locals-they had relaxed voices, long black dreads, bright neon colored pants\
  \ and tops, and reggae inspired vibes. \n\nI was intrigued. I would have never expected\
  \ to see such strong Jamaican influences in Thailand. As the night progressed, I\
  \ noticed the hidden Jamaican influences all throughout the town. We moved next\
  \ door, a restaurant that I visited during the day with bright colorful murals of\
  \ lions, superheroes, and other miscellaneous art. Nonetheless, the bar turned restaurant\
  \ was completely different at night. The murals were no longer just paintings on\
  \ the walls but more so illuminating, animated art pieces. All the tables were turned\
  \ into art stations with glow in the dark body paint.\n\nEverything was tranquil\
  \ yet dynamic. There was a reggae band playing tunes while others were swaying back\
  \ and forth to the beats or drifting into conversations and sharing hookah smokes.\n\
  \nThe town became enchanted. The night was led by the colorful bright red, green,\
  \ and yellow lights that lined the streets from bar to bar. \"Follow the lights\"\
  \ was the advice I got from the bar owners, and that I did. It was surreal-a night\
  \ where I couldn't believe how strategically everything was placed in this town\
  \ and hidden to only bloomed at night. \n\nTo this day, I try to grasp and store\
  \ all the memories of that night. It was full of experiences and emotions transcending\
  \ into a world of disbelief."
