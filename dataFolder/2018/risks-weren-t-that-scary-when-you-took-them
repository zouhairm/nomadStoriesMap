Text: "I did not know how and where to start to share my experience with you.  Once,\
  \ I saw posters of this opportunity in Argentina, my eyes got a flame. It was my\
  \ dream for a long time. I am a frequent and very budget traveller. For the whole\
  \ past year, I was working to save up for a travel across Asia with carry-on luggage,\
  \ 2 t-shirts and 2 shorts and a big dream in my pocket.  I started in Malaysia.\
  \ I was taking public transports everywhere I go as it was cheap and much more fascinating.\
  \ I was staying in the hostels every night and it was one of the best experiences\
  \ in my life; as I like to say \u201C Closer to people and closer to culture\u201D\
  . I have met unforgettable people along the way, who helped me plan every next step\
  \ or direction I took. As I planned little in advance to explore more and to find\
  \ secret places (which I found only thought communication with locals). Sometimes\
  \ it was challenging, as for example staying in a 12 people dorm in the jungles\
  \ of Malaysia, with mouse running around and cold showers, but I have never regretted\
  \ my choices. Never. It taught me a life experience of how not only value surroundings,\
  \ but how to love your inner self. I came to that moment of \u2018truth\u2019 when\
  \ (surprisingly) was wearing dirty clothes, was exhausted after a long hike and\
  \ knew that I still need to go to cold shower. And it was one of the greatest moment\
  \ in my life. The best things came unexpectedly, as I am a big fashion-lover and\
  \ went truly beyond what I though I am .  That trip was 2.5 month long and included\
  \ travels around remote areas of Malaysia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Japan; if for\
  \ that time , I only needed one carry-on luggage, then that\u2019s everything I\
  \ need if I will every decide to just take one bag for whole my life. Nothing else.\
  \  \nThis trip to Asia was not the only trip that I have experienced in my life,\
  \ but one of the most challenging and life-changing once. I still remember my hiking\
  \ to the crater of active volcano and another one in a gas mask to the most acidic\
  \ sulfur lake with a blue lava at night; i remember it all and it always stay with\
  \ me in the most difficult time of my life to keep my face up and still be \u2018\
  closer to the ground\u2019 (to still feel everyone around you). I would be very\
  \ grateful to get another unforgettable experience in Argentina."
