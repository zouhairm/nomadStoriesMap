Text: "While studying in Germany, I met an amazing person who became like a sister\
  \ to me during my time away from all my loved ones. My friend would always talk\
  \ about her country with such reverence and love, that it was impossible not to\
  \ fall in love with it just from her stories, but she went one step further and\
  \ invited me to spend our school break with her and her family for one month! \n\
  \nHow can I describe Georgia?! Nothing that I say can do it justice. I do not mean\
  \ that the Country itself is like a mystic city like El Dorado, but what mesmerized\
  \ me the most, was the hospitality with which Georgian people, welcome foreigners.\
  \ \n\nThus bringing me to the topic at hand, which is that the last thing that I\
  \ ever expected when arriving in Georgian soil, was to be treated like royalty (lol).\
  \ My friend's family went to pick us up at the airport, and when we arrived at their\
  \ house, they had flowers for us and a cake with the Georgian and American flag\
  \ drawn on it. During my whole stay there, I was treated like part of their family\
  \ and everywhere we went people were so atentive; always offering something to eat\
  \ and drink. \n\nThe second thing that I was not expecting was to be met with such\
  \ a natural wonder. Georgia sits along the Caucasus mountains, and has many rivers\
  \ flowing throigh it. My wonderful host took me to many regions within Gerogia,\
  \ where I got to try all the amazing food and discover the slight differences that\
  \ exist from the small villages to the bigger cities. At some point, after my visit,\
  \ I learned that tolstoy was inspired by Georgia for some of his writing and having\
  \ been there, I can understand why. \n\nImagine being able to go to the village\
  \ and eat fresh chesse made by your friend's grandma in the morning, and in the\
  \ afternoon be strolling the streets of Tblisi (Georgia's capital), which is filled\
  \ with ancient looking structures as well as modern architecture. In the weekend\
  \ then you travel to the seaside town of Batumi, where you sit down on the rocks\
  \ and listen to the sound of the wakes crashing against the shore while gazing at\
  \ the magnificent sight of the mountains touching the ocean and the sky just cascating\
  \ them, thus forming an everlasting  image of true beauty. \n\nLast but not least,\
  \ the food!! As aforementioned, Georgians have many traditions that surround food,\
  \ like supras or feasts. In such events, one will be able to find Badrijani (eggplant\
  \ with wallnut paste), Khachapuri (Georgian bread with chese and on ocasion with\
  \ beans)."
