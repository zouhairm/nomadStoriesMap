Text: "I never knew his name. That seems rude in retrospect but for everything there\
  \ is a time and season, and in Bangkok for two weeks that muggy March, it was enough\
  \ that we knew each other by sight. I was at the Airbnb up the road where the traffic\
  \ fell off and the expats congregated around tranquil rooftop pools; he sold chicken\
  \ feet to the hookers working that street.\n\nI don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever\
  \ touched the cold, rubbery foot of a chicken but it feels like death. In parts\
  \ of Asia, they are a delicacy. The Chinese call them Phoenix Claws and will happily\
  \ nibble upon them in dimsum restaurants or slurp them in soup. In Thailand, it\u2019\
  s nutritious poor people food, grilled and served with sticky rice. They\u2019re\
  \ scrawny leftovers bought for cheap off the processing plants where it\u2019s a\
  \ waste byproduct. They hung an iodine yellow, pinned to a rack with clothespins,\
  \ in the haze of the smoke rising off the grill, framed against the lean, hungry\
  \ faces of the working girls stretched out beside the sidewalk in a tired daze on\
  \ a rattan mat that seemingly belonged to nobody and everybody.\n\nI think of that\
  \ one street as quintessential Bangkok: Arab tourists with hookahs outside the pool\
  \ joint staffed by women in tight Hooters-blouses; elderly Europeans enticed from\
  \ their upscale apartment buildings by indifferent French cuisine; Indian uncles\
  \ furtively soliciting ladyboys; a cross-section of Thais just going about their\
  \ lives; a raucous beer garden blaring 80s hits and stuffed full of white men with\
  \ nowhere to go; and vendors selling every type of food of the ladies liked \u2013\
  \n\nSpicy noodles with seafood, just like mama used to make. Crunchy, crispy bugs\
  \ for protein and the selfies with the adventurous tourist. Fat, sour pork sausages\
  \ spiked with rice. A drinks cart with multicolored syrups. And the chicken feet.\n\
  \nThe vendor, his round glasses perched on his nose, would briskly fan the coals\
  \ while talking to the girls. He was a man accustomed to giving the girls what they\
  \ needed - food, encouragement, a listening ear, a wolf whistle, a naughty joke.\
  \ For me, he had a wiggle of the eyebrows (jocular, not disrespectful) and a wide\
  \ smile that revealed four teeth, rotted brown. One night, when a party spilled\
  \ into the street, he stopped and kept an eye on me to make sure nobody followed\
  \ me home.\n\nAnd that was how I knew I had a friend. Sometimes, one is handed a\
  \ gift of great value for no good reason at all and all one can do is be grateful."
