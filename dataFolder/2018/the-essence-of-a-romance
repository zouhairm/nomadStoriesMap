Text: "I had not planned to do the Manali-Leh, but then Thinles wrote me that he was\
  \ going home. \"I have to take everything back, including the jeep. Can you help?\u201D\
  \ Although Thinles had studied abroad for several years, he remained a son of the\
  \ Himalayas, and the prospect of traveling with him one of the most legendary roads\
  \ on earth was almost irresistible. \nManali was beautiful at 5 in the morning.\
  \ The mist of the monsoon blended with the smells of the end of summer. We had to\
  \ leave early because Thinles had to reach Ladakh within the day. The journey normally\
  \ takes 48 hours, but we did not have all that time. \nThe road begins with an ascent\
  \ to the Kardung La. On this pass, which is the first of a long series, Thinles\
  \ pulled out incense and the katagh (the ritual white scarf). The spirits of the\
  \ mountains are powerful and their protection must be sought respectfully. From\
  \ there, the roads runs down quickly, almost precipitates in tight curves, and Thinles\
  \ knew them one by one. This was reassuring, because the track often became a path,\
  \ and sometimes it simply disappeared in the streams filled with glacier water.\
  \ \nOnce arrived in the great floodplain that opens up after the Lungalacha Pass,\
  \ we treated ourselves to a short break. Tea and rice with lentils in a nomadic\
  \ tent. My legs were already shaking for the jolts of the road and our hosts received\
  \ us with exquisite courtesy, but we had to go.\nIn the last part of the journey\
  \ I was only hoping it would end soon. Adrenaline, altitude sickness, fatigue. When\
  \ we were about to reach the last pass (17,480 ft), I staged a mutiny: We stop here.\
  \ Any piece of desert will do, as long as it does not move. Minutes later the son\
  \ of the Himalayas stopped our jeep in Pang, a few tents for high altitude travelers.\
  \ Without the slightest attempt at being civil, I entered the nearest one and fell\
  \ on a mattress. \nBut why is this road legendary? \nThe Manali-Leh climbs over\
  \ some of the highest passes in the world, travels through deserted valleys, washed\
  \ by gigantic rivers still in formation. You move between peaks never touched by\
  \ humans and under the glaciers from which the great waterways of Asia are born.\
  \ Masses of golden rocks can suddenly crumble down and change the geography of the\
  \ land. You travel between a swirl of colors and immense spaces that can elate and\
  \ can kill you in no time. And maybe this is the reason. The road is legendary because\
  \ it is beautiful and terrible, that is the essence of a romance."
