Text: "Crackles in Argentina\n\nSometimes you let life take turns which you realise\
  \ much later would have been better prevented. Slamming the brakes can be hard though,\
  \ especially when the road ahead is unknown. But slowly with time, the path not\
  \ taken begins to nag at the heels and creeps up on you, lying next to you at night,\
  \ amongst all of your belongings in your comfortable flat, while all you want is\
  \ to sleep outside on the grass underneath the stars - and not in between walls\
  \ built by your career. \nIt is not easy to walk away from it all, but the feeling\
  \ of wasting life away without taking in the world pushed me to step over the edge\
  \ of safety nets of steady income and an everyday on repeat. \n\nSitting underneath\
  \ the dark sky I can see the nearest galaxy, the one under which I was born and\
  \ under which I will die. Thousands of stars sweep over the horizon lit up in clouds\
  \ of dust, a sight London\u2019s pollution normally hides from me. I am in Argentina,\
  \ seated by the campfire amongst a small group of strangers. A block of wood falls\
  \ into the fire with a dull thud, a crackle and then a spark. The boy on my right,\
  \ Alejandro, pokes the wood lightly with a stick he has been carrying around all\
  \ week, drawing in the sand and pointing to the horizon. \n\nI follow the stick\
  \ with my eyes, through the flickering haze of the bonfire, which draws a pattern\
  \ on the night sky that mimics the flow of water that ran over my feet at Lago de\
  \ Pajaro in the early morning, the sun geometrically shifting the shape of my toes\
  \ and the small stones on the sand. I slowly drift away embraced by the heat of\
  \ the fire and a rather strong local wine, until a kind voice picks me up, which\
  \ beckons me to listen to a story of a little house on the hill. The woman on my\
  \ left, Maria, has been the kindest host in Porognal, where we are right now, a\
  \ forest-rich village not far from the border of Bolivia. As she takes a swig of\
  \ beer, a whiff of smoked fish fills the air as the man opposite me turns the freshly\
  \ caught trout lying atop the flames.\n\nTravelling, while moving, I went back,\
  \ to standing still, to remembering the little things which bring me joy. I lay\
  \ in the grass and look at the clouds passing over the white tipped mountains.\n\
  One must not forget this -"
