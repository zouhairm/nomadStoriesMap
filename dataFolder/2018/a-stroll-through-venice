Text: "Lorna stepped out of her Airbnb rental apartment and was taken aback by the\
  \ view she somehow managed to overlook earlier. The deep azure body of water before\
  \ her glistened in the afternoon sun. She wasn't staying on the main island, but\
  \ rather directly across from it and could see the majesty that was Venice from\
  \ across the way. She checked her cell for any texts from her daughter, Michelle,\
  \ who had to stay home last minute, and then walked over to the water taxi stop\
  \ to wait. The taxi soon arrived and Lorna boarded it. She needed to eat soon; her\
  \ stomach was growling. The afternoon sun was still strong and the breeze off the\
  \ water felt refreshing. Once on the main island, Lorna started off down an alley-sized\
  \ street. The stone of the buildings beside her felt cold to the touch; they looked\
  \ weathered and ancient. Lorna recalled how everything in the States was new compared\
  \ to Europe. Even the oldest buildings weren\u2019t old next to these. She meandered\
  \ along, hoping to find a place to stop and eat. After a few more paces, past all\
  \ the shops and people, she found herself now in a slightly less populated courtyard.\
  \ She spotted restaurant in the corner with outdoor seating. The friendly host set\
  \ her up at a small table with a tiny tealight candle by the outskirts of the roped\
  \ in seating area. She set her things down and sat back in her wooden chair like\
  \ it were a Lazy Boy, amazed that she made it. As she ate, she began to notice the\
  \ people congregating by the roped in area. The courtyard was becoming more crowded,\
  \ and noisy as well. They were all staring at something\u2026 She soon realized\
  \ what the commotion was about. A soccer game was on TV. Recalling that the World\
  \ Cup was going on at the moment, she figured that this must be an important game,\
  \ based on the loud cheers now erupting from the crowd. Lorna had to admit that\
  \ she knew almost nothing about soccer. The crowd could have been made up of anyone,\
  \ yet they all understood and appreciated it with the same intensity. She could\
  \ understand that feeling, as she had felt it so many times yelling at the TV with\
  \ her parents during baseball season. Turning back to the screen, she tried focusing\
  \ on the game. It looked like a lot of men in uniforms running around, but then\u2014\
  the crowd erupted in noise. Goal! Lorna felt the excitement in her chest, no longer\
  \ the guilt that felt earlier that day. She was going to love telling Michelle everything\
  \ about this trip. And best of all, it was only the first day."
