Text: "I heard him over the barely audible sound of my own gritting teeth. \u201C\
  Too tense, jie.\u201D\n\nWith the deft, trained hands of a baker, Xiao Zhang works\
  \ on the aching muscles of Beijing\u2019s Dongcheng district. As he ruthlessly kneads\
  \ my shoulders in this study of tension and release, it becomes clear that I am\
  \ the dough. \n\nMassage centers staffed by the vision impaired have proliferated\
  \ in mainland China since the 1990s, in step with the country\u2019s burgeoning\
  \ prosperity. The fate that led me here was a mix of fatigue and frugality: sessions\
  \ can cost under 15 USD an hour. At this price, there are few frills, so I lie face\
  \ down in a room with two other clients, as if inpatients at a hospital. I wasn\u2019\
  t here for decadence anyhow. Massage is but one practice within Traditional Chinese\
  \ Medicine, and the movement of chi needs no privacy. \n\nXiao Zhang uses the honorific\
  \ jie, -elder sister- not knowing that we happen to share the same last name, but\
  \ I surmise from the wrinkles blooming around his eyes that I am the younger. The\
  \ deep grooves of his forehead were borne from decades of squinting, furrowing,\
  \ holding a cell phone inches from his nose. He\u2019s been legally blind since\
  \ childhood.\n\nHis voice lights up when I inform him of the coincidence, and we\
  \ propel into instant sibling status. An audiovisual symphony ensues as I watch\
  \ his red Adidas nimbly tapping, a guide cane of sorts, in rhythm with the low whirr\
  \ of a standing fan and his staccato chatter. It is my new brother\u2019s sixth\
  \ year as a masseuse, though he\u2019d like to work abroad, so long as there was\
  \ Chinese food. I wonder what he\u2019d think of General Tso, of crab rangoons,\
  \ and whether generations ago, we were closely related. \n\nUnlike most Beijingers,\
  \ Xiao Zhang\u2019s commute mercifully involves no hurtling about underground or\
  \ kickboxing his way out of buses at rush hour. Staff reside on site, preparing\
  \ meals on two-burner electric stoves plugged into water stained walls. I remark\
  \ on the distinct aroma of chives stretching in from the kitchen and am playfully\
  \ invited to stay for dinner. \u201CShared food is much tastier,\u201D he grins,\
  \ \u201Ceven if you eat less.\u201D \n\nI sit up after the hour, renewed. Again,\
  \ traveling has afforded me semblances of family: those who help you stand taller,\
  \ relax into your own body. Those who intermittently coo and fuss about your eating\
  \ too much, or not nearly enough. \n\nTwo masseurs plop down at a worn vinyl sofa\
  \ to a well deserved plate of homemade dumplings. As it turns out, they work on\
  \ real dough too."
