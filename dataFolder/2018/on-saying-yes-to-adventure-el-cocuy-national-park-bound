Text: "The last thing I expected was to say Yes. I\u2019ve just arrived at the final\
  \ stop of my whirldwind trip around Colombia. I\u2019ve saved the \u201Cbest until\
  \ last\u201D - I\u2019m pumped about spending the next five days in the Adventure\
  \ Sports Capital of Colombia, San Gil. But before I\u2019ve even had time to put\
  \ my backpack down, I\u2019m accosted by a chap with a cheeky grin who says: \u201C\
  you've got to join our El Cocuy adventure\u201D. \nFresh off the nightbus, I\u2019\
  m struggling to process such a random proposition. El Cocuy? Like the Colombian\
  \ Andes near Venezuela that reopened to the public two weeks ago? The one with peaks\
  \ that rise up to 5,330m, glaciers, and those funny Frailejones plants that look\
  \ palm trees crossed with cacti? Yes.  \nI still don\u2019t know why I didn't say\
  \ no. I\u2019d been so excited about this part of my trip. Santander is a Department\
  \ reknown for its mountain bike trails, rafting and great hikes. I was joining hordes\
  \ of other adrenaline-junkies-on-a-mission. \nBut the promise of Adventure was too\
  \ alluring. And I wasn\u2019t the only one wooed. Six of us were on board. We spent\
  \ the day lapping up anything we could find about getting there, what to bring and\
  \ what conditions to expect. It quickly became clear that rain, snow and changeable\
  \ weather were guaranteed. Other information was harder to come by. The park had\
  \ been closed for over a year, mainly due to concerns from the region\u2019s indigenous\
  \ group (the U\u2019wa) about the environmental impact of tourism. The park had\
  \ been reopened under highly restrictive circumstances. Up-to-date information was\
  \ scarce. We would have to find it out for ourselves. \nIt took us just over 14\
  \ hours to drive 254km - most of the journey followed a meandering dirt track. We\
  \ passed a handful of villages, and glimpsed only a couple of small shops. Thank\
  \ goodness we\u2019d done a big shop before leaving. We arrived in the administrative\
  \ centre of Guican and held our breath, unsure whether our adventure would be allowed\
  \ to bloom. Authority can be tricky to negotiate. On this particular occasion things\
  \ were made difficult  but not insurmountable. Photocopies of insurance, proof we\
  \ would use a guide, and hard cash were demanded. We were eventually back on the\
  \ road.\nAnd how to best summarise what followed? Yes, it was exhausting, cold,\
  \ and wet and the hikes were tough. And yes, I can\u2019t say I wasn\u2019t pleased\
  \ to get back to the warmth of the hostel and the promise of hot food. But boy has\
  \ the unexpected marvelousness of this adventure made its mark on my memory bank."
