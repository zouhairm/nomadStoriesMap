Text: "The Trenchtown Community, located in the parish of Saint Andrew & Kingston,\
  \ is one of the first squatter communities in the capital region of Jamaica. Home\
  \ to Bob Marley, rocksteady & reggae music, and two of the best soccer clubs\u2014\
  it is primarily an impoverished self-built community where violence prevails, creativity\
  \ and resourcefulness abound. \n\nBob Marley and his mother left home in Nine Mile,\
  \ Saint Ann's Parish and arrived in Trenchtown when Bob was 12 years old. He had\
  \ a room in what is now known as Culture Yard in Trenchtown. This community lived\
  \ together, made music together and fostered a Rastafari community where Bob Marley\
  \ flourished and developed his influential musical style and one-love world philosophy.\
  \ The move was great for Bob, and provided the space for his talents to develop\
  \ since Trenchtown became the breeding ground for many musical legends.\n\nCurrently,\
  \ Culture Yard is run by Rastafarians. They are making reggae music, growing herbs\
  \ (basil, thyme, scallion, cannabis, etc), and living with the belief that one love\
  \ along with rasta values of health and sustainability is the best way to live.\
  \ Our uncle David took my sister and I to Trenchtown and Culture Yard. He used to\
  \ babysit Bob's first two children, Cedella and David \"Ziggy,\" who were both born\
  \ in Trenchtown. He showed us the house and rooms in which Bob Marley lived, as\
  \ well as the field where he, Bob and others played  soccer.\n\nOnce we arrived\
  \ at Culture Yard, Stoneman, one of the of the managing community members, immediately\
  \ treated us like family. He gave us a tour of their small museum and talked to\
  \ us about the present role of Culture Yard in the Trenchtown community. Stoneman\
  \ said we had good vibes so he and the other Rasta brethrens welcomed us like family!\n\
  \nThe Trenchtown community was notorious for violence in the 1970's and still is\
  \ considered unsafe, but it has remained a hub for creativity, music and the belief\
  \ of keeping one\u2019s spirit strong and the world peaceful. Bob Marley's credos,\
  \ found in his music, are very much alive in Culture Yard. The resourcefulness necessary\
  \ to create and maintain this community is testament to the people\u2019s dogged\
  \ determination to survive and live despite great odds. Culture Yard remains positive\
  \ and inspiring despite the issues and challenges that exist. I was so grateful\
  \ to be have been part of this community, even for just one day."
