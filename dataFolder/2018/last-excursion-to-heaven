Text: "I inched towards the railing and looked 20000 feet below, my heart raced imploring\
  \ to step back.\nFlashbacks of last night made its way into my mind.  I begin to\
  \ fumble with my stick.\nSuddenly I started to see what happened a few hours ago.\
  \ I began, my Yatra to a place which not many people know of but in my religion\
  \ if you get there once in your life time, it is considered a huge thing! After\
  \ all, not everyone is blessed enough to be there.\n I was okay in the beginning\
  \ but as we descended higher I was the first one to run out of breath which was\
  \ the last thing I expected as everything was going so smooth that at times it was\
  \ too good to be true! \nA point came when I told my brother, I can walk no more.\
  \ My brother completely annoyed scolded me saying how fat I have become that I couldn't\
  \ push myself ahead.\nMy face grew hot and head bowed with shame! Wasn't I working\
  \ out for the past 2-3 months? Wasn't I trying to control myself?\n\"What is up\
  \ with you?\" My brother's words boomed into my ears making me jump a little.\n\"\
  Nothing.\" I said impassively. \"You go ahead. I don't want to ruin your trip.\"\
  I opened the torch of my phone and let him go.\nThe soothing breeze came to my rescue.\
  \ It was giving me the confidence that I needed. One by one, piece by piece whenever\
  \ I struggled it took care of me.\nI looked above at the infinitesimal sky, and\
  \ was mesmerized by its beauty. It was covered with infinite number of stars. Wasn't\
  \ it itself a miracle?\nAt exactly 5:40am I could see the sun rising. The view in\
  \ front of me was captivating. To say it was beautiful was an understatement, it\
  \ was a blessing to be there, all the pain was definitely worth it.\nFor the next\
  \ 6 hours, we did Vandana, from one Tonk to another we went to 24 different tonks.\n\
  Finally, we were standing at the entry of 24th and What happened in the next three\
  \ minutes, I am going to remember this my whole life! As my feet made contact with\
  \ every stair of the crisp white marble, my calf muscles began to ease up.\nWe were\
  \ there inside for approximately half an hour but it was all in a Haze. I joined\
  \ my hands, closed my eyes.\n\"What are you doing? Step back!\" My brother's sharp\
  \ voice filled with concern bombarded my introspection period, \n\"I am alright,\
  \ stop yelling!\" I riposted and slowly stepped back.\n\"You are insane! Don't you\
  \ care for your life?\" So it began, my brother reprimanded me right in the middle\
  \ of the road but who cares I was already enchanted with the sudden serenity that\
  \ I have founded within myself."
