Text: "The sun is balmy against our skin, clear blue skies and verdant green Himalayas\
  \ envelope us, the air free from the noxious fumes of our trite existence. We are\
  \ in Rishikesh, Yoga capital of the World and Adventure hub for Indians, to shoot\
  \ rapids, on the Ganges, the holy river of the Hindus. We need this break from our\
  \ individual lives to feel close to each other again.\n\n\u201CPaddle, paddle guys!\u201D\
  \ The guide\u2019s command reverberates in the air as the raft cartwheels on a mighty\
  \ hydraulic. By now we have fought our way through rapids benign and mighty, coursing\
  \ through narrow passage ways, withstanding rough currents, riding on waves low\
  \ and high. Oblivious to the temples and ashrams dotting the hillside, our shrieks\
  \ of fear are followed by peals of ecstatic laughter as we conquer new obstacles,\
  \ together. \n\nIt is her first adventure sport, as for me, I have a jumped off\
  \ a few cliffs before, something she is inspired by. Reassurance from me coupled\
  \ with the safety statistics of White Water Rafting have emboldened my sister- my\
  \ little one, into accompanying me on this trip.\n\n\u201CDon\u2019t worry, I got\
  \ you\u201D  ,as always my words to her, before we get on the raft.\n\n\u201CHigh\
  \ Slide!!!\u201D The guide\u2019s command drowned by the roar of the water as the\
  \ ferocious rapid flings us to the left and within seconds our raft capsizes. I\
  \ feel myself being pulled deep into the formidable blue darkness of the river,\
  \ my ascent blocked by the overturned raft above. I struggle to come up for breath,\
  \ limbs flailing, feeling claustrophobic.\n\n \u201CIf the raft overturns and you\
  \ are trapped below, push it to a side to come up\u201D the guide\u2019s words come\
  \ back to me. I push with all my might and after much struggle resurface. Once free\
  \ I swallow the air in gulps.\n\nI frantically scan the scene for my sister who\
  \ is nowhere to be seen. The realisation that I have endangered her hits me like\
  \ a rough wave, fear and guilt rising up in my chest making me nauseous.\n\nI spot\
  \ her further downstream, struggling against the current carrying her away from\
  \ me. I shout her name, our eyes meet momentarily. Her eyes raw with fear, boring\
  \ into mine, pleading for help.\n\nHelpless against forces taking me away from her,\
  \ struggling to stay afloat in the Ganges, I spot rescue kayaks speeding in both\
  \ our directions. I am relieved that we will be safe but choked with the realisation\
  \ that from this moment onwards I will never be able to reassure my little one with\
  \  \u201C Don\u2019t worry, I got you\u201D ever again."
