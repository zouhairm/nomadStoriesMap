Text: "I first met Phillipe at a Group Relations Conference while touring Paris. A\
  \ poem I wrote about Shiva and the group dynamics in the conference really impressed\
  \ Phillipe. He offered me a room in his apartment in Montparnasse which he shared\
  \ with his girlfriend Marie Louise. I accepted with alacrity.\nPhilippe is from\
  \ Togo but is French in every way that counts. He is a gallery owner cum lawyer\
  \ in the making and has a studio in St Germaine, the heart of Paris. \nPhillipe\
  \ and I took a while to get used to each other. When he announced that Marie Louise\
  \ was travelling on work, my Indian warning bells ran wild. I had read somewhere\
  \ that Togolese men follow polygamous practices which did not help. Phillipe showed\
  \ me to my tiny room and bathroom \u2013 both of which didn\u2019t have a lock,\
  \ I was alarmed to note! \nWhen we knew each other better, he was tickled by my\
  \ hyperactive imagination. The story became a source of much amusement to him and\
  \ his Parisian friends! \nPhilippe\u2019s hospitality while he showed me how to\
  \ get around in France, special meals that we enjoyed \u2013 the introduction to\
  \ snails which I abhorred and a Spanish tapas bar with a sensuous\_flamenco dancer\
  \ are some charming memories we fashioned together.\nIn a moving biography of Marie\
  \ Antoinette, Stefan Zweig reconstructs her as an ordinary girl who became queen\
  \ and was unprepared for it. A friend of Phillipe\u2019s went into impassioned defence\
  \ of the execution, stating there is irrevocable proof she was a spy. Phillipe had\
  \ his own interpretation. \u2018It does not matter if she was a victim or not. She\
  \ has shattered the myth of invincibility.\u2019\nSeveral years later when I visited\
  \ Paris again with my husband, Philippe hosted us in his cosy studio apartment above\
  \ the gallery. \nThe three of us took evening walks along the Latin Quarters and\
  \ enjoyed many wonderful conversations. Philippe treated us to a Togolese meal one\
  \ evening and we relished smoked fish, cassava crumbs, plantains and beans with\
  \ a bottle of Chardonnay. \nThrough Phillipe, I discovered the beautiful work of\
  \ Togolese artists such as Komlan Kavi. The bold strokes and vibrancy bring alive\
  \ a sense of cultural milieu. \nWe were saddened when the terrorist attacks happened\
  \ in Paris recently. Phillipe said he was only a few streets away at the time. \n\
  \u2018It\u2019s not a nice place to live anymore.\u2019 \n\u201CCome and live with\
  \ us.\u201D I said. \n\u2018Not possible. I will come for a working holiday. And\
  \ I cannot do water. I like my toilet paper!\u2019\nWe laughed with a shared sense\
  \ of the many absurdities that define our friendship."
