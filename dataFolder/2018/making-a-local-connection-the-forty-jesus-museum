Text: "Being traveler gives you experiences that you were not able to find in your\
  \ own home. It gives you knowledge, introduces to you multicultural friends that\
  \ believe different social norms, different weather, different food, and probably\
  \ different ways of life. My travel to Kenya\u2019s port city Mombasa was an amazing\
  \ that taught me the long history of the people in the city and their Arab world\
  \ and Europe business relationship. During my stay in Mombasa, I paid three hours\
  \ visit to Fort Jesus Museum that was built in 16th century by Portuguese and designed\
  \ by Italian artist Giovanni. The site hosts a hundreds of multinational visitors.\
  \ I learnt a lot from the museum including; the military materials used at that\
  \ time, ancient drawings, caves, ancient utensils and grinding materials as well\
  \ as the long time history of Oman and East African Communities especially the cities\
  \ that lies along the seashores. During the tour, I asked a museum docent for how\
  \ many people attend to visit per day. The docent replied \u201CThough it depends\
  \ on the season, normally the museum receives approximately 2 to 3 hundreds\u201D\
  . The Omanis build again the Fort Jesus and made the walls very thick in order that\
  \ weapons do not penetrate and until know it is very difficult to easily collapse.\
  \ All the building was not re-innovated and still appears very good though it were\
  \ built before 500 years. The military barrack, watch tower, passenger steps, ammunition\
  \ caves, conference room, mosque, well and water reservoir and the fence of the\
  \ center are all ancient and look very attractive. The other elements I have glanced\
  \ were; canons that were used to bomb for the enemies, gone grinding stones, drums,\
  \ weapons and life bullets belonging to the old guns, gold, Omanis doors made by\
  \ gold and silver, and other drawings and very attractive decorations."
