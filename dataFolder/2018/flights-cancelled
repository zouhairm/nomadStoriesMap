Text: "\u201CFlights Cancelled\u201D Flashed on every marquis. SJO airport had been\
  \ grounded due to the volcanic ash blown in from the Turrialba Volcano. I had just\
  \ been informed I had four more days before I could get another flight back to Miami.\
  \ My trip so far had been brief and with this delay I was going to get to see parts\
  \ of Costa Rica I thought I would have missed.  \nI returned to the city center\
  \ and found a hotel in La Sabana district of San Jose. I knew I wanted to experience\
  \ the rainforest. I found an excursion to Barulio Carillo National Park set to leave\
  \ the hotel in the morning. The trip included a guided hike and a zip line course.\
  \ I had never been one for heights, and definitely not one to launch myself into\
  \ the air from a perfectly secure structure, but I had never been one to be stranded\
  \ due to volcano and that seemed to be working out.  \nWe arrived at the park and\
  \ began our hike. The energy of the forest buzzed. It smelled like both decomposition\
  \ and new life. This magical place was equally intimidating and inspiring. As we\
  \ approached our zip line course, my heart started to flutter.  The crew hustled\
  \ through a quick safety lesson and before I could hesitate, we were on the platform.\
  \  We started out with some shorter lines, maybe 20ft. in the air.   They were fast\
  \ and exciting but hadn\u2019t put a real fear in me yet.  Then came our final line.\
  \  A 700m line well above the canopy across a ravine that left the jungle floor\
  \ an unsettling distance from my feet.  \nAs I took my place on the platform and\
  \ the guides hooked me into the line my ankles began to shake.   One guide saw my\
  \ trepidation and told me I was welcome to walk the several miles down the trail\
  \ back to the base. And then in the same breath, he launched himself down the line,\
  \ soaring through the air arms out wide. I was alone on a 3\u2019x2\u2019 platform\
  \ hundreds of feet in the air.  I looked back at the steps that would lower me safely\
  \ to the ground.  I could make the hike in an hour or so.  Then my gaze drifted\
  \ back down the line.  About a half mile away the guide had landed on the platform.\
  \ I thought quickly of all the things I had accomplished that I never would have\
  \ dreamed of with out the magic of that Costa Rican volcano. I took a deep breath\
  \ and let the warm air of the rainforest fill my lungs and my soul with the beauty\
  \ of this place.  With that breath I realized in front of me was the chance to fly\
  \ through the jungle like the vibrant birds I had seen on our hike. As I exhaled,\
  \ I leapt."
