Text: "Finally, the fueling was done and the long waiting was over. The bus bossed\
  \ out of the service station with irregular raves that caused the passengers to\
  \ spill drinks and kiss chairs. After travelling for about two hundred kilometers,\
  \ we reached a small town called Palapye. The uneven bus raves resumed as we entered\
  \ another service station. Musendo (the bus conductor) was off the bus before it\
  \ could stop. He reemerged with a 20-liter container of water. The two gentlemen\
  \ behind me whispered \u201Cthe bus is over- boiling\u201D. \u201CDumela Rra\u201D\
  \ I politely greeted Musendo with a voice mixed with agitation and confidence. \u201C\
  Morena Lokae\u201D Musendo replied with a breezy voice of a youth who just scored\
  \ a deciding goal. \u201CTsala yame, I need you to tell me what the delay is about,\
  \ and when are we going to reach the border?\u201D my questions were all gravitating\
  \ towards one intention: My refund. Apparently, I hit the right notes, as Musendo\
  \ replied to my intent with the question: \u201CObathla refund?\u201D before I could\
  \ celebrate my victory, the jovial youth continued \u201CSee Rra, bus this one overheating,\
  \ border delay a two hour\u201D Musendo had successfully chopped the command of\
  \ the English language in his mouth, for free! I wanted to laugh, but then I was\
  \ humbled by his honesty, and his jovial mood was somehow infectious. I went back\
  \ into the bus with a mixture of awkwardness, victory and gratification. As much\
  \ as Musendo and most young people in Botswana struggle to dialogue in good English,\
  \ it is not their fault. From the deputy sheriff, to the president\u2019s office,\
  \ Setswana is the language of communication. I resentfully eyed at her as I pondered\
  \ on how someone can eat a boiled egg in a bus? and sipped coke straight from the\
  \ two-liter plastic bottle. Good eating habits and basic diet is something that\
  \ has vexed me in Africa. I strongly believe that nutrition must be emphasized from\
  \ early childhood. I guess as I was deliberating on the nutrition anguishes of Africa,\
  \ I slid into a blissful sleep. I woke up to ear-splitting shrieks of women. The\
  \ bus had made an emergency braking and the smell of burning tyres attested to that\
  \ fact. In front of us, a light gray overpowering silhouette, the bull elephant\
  \ crossed the road majestically and vanished into the forests of Nata. This reminded\
  \ me of the splendor of Africa, yet the presence of the cross-border traders reminded\
  \ me of the poverty in Africa.  We arrived at the border at ten in the morning,\
  \ this was exactly two hours delay as Musendo had said."
