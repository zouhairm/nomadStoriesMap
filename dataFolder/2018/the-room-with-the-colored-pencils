Text: "The sign said open, so we walked inside \nA lady kneeled at the fireplace,\
  \ stoking the flame, was surprised by our presence \n\nI want to remember that experience\n\
  Remember that room and the smell of the fire wafting through the air as the embers\
  \ cracked and disintegrated under bright orange flames\n\nArt hung from the walls\
  \ and seemingly filled all the spaces in between \nOn the table by the window sat\
  \ a stack of sketchbooks and hundreds of colored pencils \nAn artists\u2019 space\
  \ \n\nAn older man dressed in green appeared around the corner, undeniably the artist\
  \ \nHe was a kind man with an aura that filled the room with an inexplicable serenity\
  \ \n\nAs he spoke, heat rose from the crackling logs and filled the space with an\
  \ exceptional warmth, a contrast to the brisk coastal air whirling outside the window\
  \ \n\nHis work was filled with depictions and stories of life long before my own\
  \ on the Isle of Skye \nThe Isle, a piece of land that encompasses so much of my\
  \ own history wrapped up in the towering summits and mystifying beauty \nHe says\
  \ it\u2019s enough to drive you mad \n\nMy eyes scanned the room in what seemed\
  \ to be a meditative fashion, as they crossed over the walls and the tables, the\
  \ windows and the door\nBetween the warmth of the room and the wandering of my eyes,\
  \ I became lost in a daze as I pondered the evolution of my own life \nWondering\
  \ if I too would someday sit in a studio of my own, filled to the brim with experiences\
  \ that were enough to drive me mad\n\nI felt a strange connection to this artist,\
  \ one I can\u2019t fully explain in words\n\nAs we prepared to leave, I realized\
  \ I had not told him my name \nWhen I did, he told me of his neighbor, the one who\
  \ shares my name \nHe said she also shares his birthday - the 16th of February\n\
  A day before my own \n\nBefore we left, he sat at the table and flipped on the lamp\
  \ as he pulled out his most recent work and a single colored pencil \nFor a moment\
  \ time had stopped and all was still as I pressed the shutter on my old film camera\
  \ \nA memory captured in time\n\nA feeling I can\u2019t fully explain came over\
  \ me when I pushed open the door to walk outside\nI felt a tear stream down my face,\
  \ cold as ice, as it mixed with the crisp January air\nIt felt as if I was saying\
  \ goodbye to someone I\u2019d known forever\n\nAs we walked through the fence and\
  \ down the road, I looked up to see him waving goodbye through the window of the\
  \ room where we were, still warm with the burning fire \nThe room with the colored\
  \ pencils"
