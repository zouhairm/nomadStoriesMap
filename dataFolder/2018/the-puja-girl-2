Text: "Every night she comes carrying her basket looking for me calling Puja Puja\
  \ and then her face breaks into delight when she sees me and she runs pointing at\
  \ her basket of little wax shapes with a wick protruding.\n\nI smile and fill up\
  \ with a joy I can\u2019t quite fathom.  I hand over the rupees and she squats beside\
  \ the Mother of all Life and lights each one with clear serious intention on her\
  \ face and I watch her wondering what is this? What is this about? I simply love\
  \ to sit and watch her, watch her face, her joy, her intention and try to read it\
  \ as she lights one after the other and lets them float down the wide river.\n\n\
  There is a magic, a mysticism happening here that I feel so Grateful to be included\
  \ in but totally at sea to understand.  This magic, this mysticism is everywhere\
  \ here and yet what is it? I look around me at this amazing place\u2026.full of\
  \ colour, smells seeing two realities at the same time\u2026.one a sea of colour\
  \ and activity, the air shimmering a strange gold but from what...is it the smoke\
  \ from funeral pyres or dust or the temples which dont seem to be quite solid. \
  \ One blink and it is the dirtiest, smelliest place I have ever been with people\
  \ trying to sell me a tour to see a burning body\u2026.what is this place?\n\nIt\
  \ is 1996, I am not remotely aware of the world wide web or mobile phones,  all\
  \ I possess is my lonely planet book to fill in the gaps.  I only came here because\
  \ I liked the sound of the name \u2018Varanasi\u2019 and a friend told me it is\
  \ like \u2018Lourdes for the Hindus\u2019.  I was annoyed when I realised I had\
  \ arrived during a festival so it would be packed even more than usual...and the\
  \ only room I could get was in a tiny room in an overcrowded home at one of the\
  \ Ghats which if I looked and listened with my heart rather than my head and eyes\
  \ was perfect...perfect because outside this was where this beautiful Being found\
  \ me each evening.\n\n22 years later there has not been a day that I do not find\
  \ myself going back there, to that city of the Golden temples, that festival of\
  \ Lights, to that magical experience with the Puja girl who most likely recognised\
  \  how I had no clue and did for me what my Soul so much wanted me to do there...Diwali\
  \ in Varanasi....magic on earth...the colours, the smells, the people along the\
  \ steps, the boats on the water, the temples, the lights on the water, so much life\
  \ happening in one place, one Golden place, the home of Shiva, Mama Ganga and a\
  \ beautiful Puja girl."
