Text: "A beautiful tree growing on the fifth floor of a building in ruins on the streets\
  \ of Havana inspired me to make a film. It was called, \u201CThe Tree\u201D. This\
  \ tree magically also witnessed the unfolding of invisible bonds.The story begins\
  \ in May 2015. I was walking on a crowded sidewalk of downtown Havana. \nAn Asian\
  \ guy with a guitar on his back was walking toward me.As we crossed paths, he grabbed\
  \ my attention.I wanted to talk to him and ask him if he was an artist participating\
  \ in Havana Biennial.I was too shy to speak to him. The first time in my life I\
  \ stood in the middle of a sidewalk watching a stranger walk away. Still I had the\
  \ thought to just approach him and exchange some words.As he got further away, I\
  \ turned and continued on my path in the opposite direction. Next month, I was in\
  \ the Havana Art School.I had gone there looking for a pianist for my thesis in\
  \ order to perform a composition. \nA poster in the hallway captured my attention.As\
  \ I got closer, I recognized a familiar face on the left corner of the poster; the\
  \ guy I passed on the sidewalk with whom I had wanted to speak. I learned that he\
  \ was an artist attending the Havana Biennial and was, as well, scheduled to make\
  \ a presentation at the art school.I wrote that date in my journal. However, I completely\
  \ forgot it and did not attend.My whole energy was directed on my thesis, the last\
  \ film I was to make in Cuba before graduating in July 2015.In August, I left Cuba\
  \ to return to my home in Costa Rica. October 2015, I went to Japan, for the first\
  \ screening of my short film, \u201CThe Tree\u201D. One evening there was a forum\
  \ of Latin American Cinema where I was asked to speak about the International Film\
  \ School of Cuba and to share the process of making the film. Afterwards there was\
  \ a dinner for the participants. Sitting next to me was a Japanese guy who started\
  \ speaking with me in Spanish. He was a filmmaker and musician.The moment he told\
  \ me that he had been in Cuba, I had a flashback of his image \u2013\nboth at the\
  \ sidewalk and on the poster. I just could not believe it! Who could imagine that\
  \ you would cross paths with a stranger in Havana, avoid your strong desire to speak\
  \ to him, and months later find that person sitting right next to you in a restaurant\
  \ in Yamagata. Another amazing detail to this story is that the tree, the inspiration\
  \ of my film, can be seen from the sidewalk where we crossed paths.\nSurrounded\
  \ by symbolical trees that magically manifest invisible bonds, we are all the leaves\
  \ of one tree."
