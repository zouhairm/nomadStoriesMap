Text: "Dear friend, my footsteps write the words of a story that has not yet come\
  \ to an end. I write you the memories that Caracas made me feel.\n\nWhen you start\
  \ your trip to Caracas, get lost in the labyrinth of its streets, but let the Vargas\
  \ coast be the first thing you remember. Look out the window of the plane and you\
  \ will see how the sky and the sea merge in unison with an expanse of sand full\
  \ of umbrellas and people. Wait to get to Maiquet\xEDa airport and look carefully\
  \ at the floor, you will see a superposition of colors created by Carlos Cruz Diez.\
  \ This art would cover large areas of land throughout the airport. You will have\
  \ to go from Maiquet\xEDa (Vargas), to Caracas, the beautiful city with the red\
  \ roofs, and that's where the adventure truly begins. \n\nCaracas is a valley, yes,\
  \ a valley. The whole city is surrounded by mountains that cover it, known by all\
  \ the people like \"El \xC1vila\" or \"Waraira Repano\". Do not think twice and\
  \ climb it. \"El \xC1vila\" is a national park, so you can climb on foot and walk\
  \ until you reach the top, or admire a huge precipice that takes you to the nothing\
  \ by cable car. You can also take as a reference to get to \"Hotel Humboldt\" on\
  \ one of the peaks of \"El \xC1vila\", but not stay, it has been closed for a long\
  \ time. Up there you will observe the whole city, and only silence will you hear.\
  \ If you pay attention and it begins to dusk you will see how the whole valley is\
  \ magically illuminated by the lights of the houses, and it will be time to descend\
  \ because the environment will become frozen and lonely. If you like to camp, you\
  \ can do it without problem, but try to be accompanied. Caracas at night is beautiful\
  \ dear friend, an old Venezuelan legend says that \"El \xC1vila\" was a great anaconda\
  \ that exploded because he could not have Mar\xEDa De la Onza as his wife. Mar\xED\
  a De la Onza (Mar\xEDa Lionza) is also part of the Venezuelan legends and she is\
  \ a pillar in some cultures.\n\nAlready properly in the city, do not think too much\
  \ about what you are going to do. You can look for a tourist guide, or simply lose\
  \ yourself. Yes, lose you. Who knows what he wants, does not know what to expect,\
  \ so walk, enter the subway and get on the first train. The Caracas\u2019s subway\
  \ is the least expensive means of transportation in the entire city, so you have\
  \ no excuse. Get to know the subway from head to toe. When you embark on your trip\
  \ to Caracas rememeber, is more than a city, it is the house that saw this young\
  \ man born and from whom I could not fall out of love.\n\nE.M."
