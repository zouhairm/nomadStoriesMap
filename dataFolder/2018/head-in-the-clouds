Text: "\u201CCome on, I have a surprise for you\u201D,  my friend Adam ushered me\
  \ to his car.  Ever the joker, I was dubious as to what was in store.  After giving\
  \ him several sideways glances, he encouraged me to guess what we were up to.  As\
  \ part of my round-the-world trip, I had opted to bypass all of the touristy things\
  \ in London to travel a few hours south-west by train to visit him in Exeter.\n\n\
  After 30 minutes of my wildest guesses, we arrived at Dunkeswell Airfield where\
  \ we were greeted by David, an accomplished member of the Somerset and Devon Ultralight\
  \ Club.  Together, they had hatched a plan to take me for a fly in David\u2019s\
  \ white, QUIK GT-450 Flexwing microlight. Which is basically a hang glider attached\
  \ to a two-seater kayak powered by a go-cart engine. I eagerly agreed to give it\
  \ a whirl!\n\nAs David prepared our craft, I was asked to don a pink and purple\
  \ jumpsuit and was handed a helmet.  After a brief safety instruction, he started\
  \ the engine and we were off, rattling towards the runway.  Radio calls were made\
  \ and after just a few meters of runway, we were in the air, buzzing into the sky\
  \ at about 1,200 feet per minute.\n\nAs we reached our cruising altitude David was\
  \ chatting to me about the region we were flying above and the microlight trips\
  \ they regularly do to France.  In front of us, as we leveled out, was a large white\
  \ fluffy cloud.  Much to my excitement, we heading straight for it.  In a transcontinental\
  \ 747, its uneventfully boring to burst through clouds, but today, as we casually\
  \ bumble towards it at 50 or 60 miles per hour we actually get to experience the\
  \ cloud.\n\nAs we enter it, I was bright-eyed with wonderment as I reach out my\
  \ hands to touch it.  The damp cool mist envelopes us and then in seconds, we appear\
  \ out the other side of the cloud, back into to the sunshine. \n\nI swung my head\
  \ around to see the cloud, now in the growing distance behind us and watched it\
  \ disappear.  The last thing I expected that morning was by that afternoon, I\u2019\
  d be literally touching the sky with my fingertips.  David offered me the hang glider\
  \ bar to have a go at the controls.  After a few minutes, a yaw left,  then right,\
  \ I handed the bar back to him.   After floating across the white cliff faces of\
  \ the Jurassic coast and doing an isle of wight fly-by.  We headed back around toward\
  \ the airfield.\n\nWell before we landed though, I had already hatched up my own\
  \ plan to look into becoming a microlight pilot.  Just so that I could redo this\
  \ moment, over and over again."
