Text: "From rainforest to red dirt, I have forged a home on my meanderings. In my\
  \ Falcon ship wagon, I am comforted on the roads windings. With a welcoming country\
  \ and ample places to stop. I rest over each night on a circuit that begins in humble\
  \ mountains. This is my new way of life. Not just a traveller or a wandering nomad,\
  \ but I have become an actual snail with a shell. I have created a richness of time\
  \ and space. It fulfils my desire of reflection. With many fast events in a short\
  \ few years one can ponder for days the effects of past decisions. For the rest\
  \ of my life will I live with those choices but now with ever more emphasis on what\
  \ shall I choose next? Well, I choose the road today, again and tomorrow. For newfound\
  \ friends I do uncover and on the roads I meet these others. Quick to speak from\
  \ soul to soul we find no point to discuss the weather. Deeper content is much better,\
  \ much easier it is to speak freely. When to connect with a local means to talk\
  \ truthfully. \n\nI stopped at the shop in place called Moore, to get a fresh breakfast\
  \ that was fresh out of order. I was offered a sweet treat in its stead, but no\
  \ matter for food when a 'soul meal' was ready to be had. She gave me almonds to\
  \ make up for the missed desire after I spoke my mind honestly we connected with\
  \ hearts on fire. She told me she was a full-time musician, and invited me to play\
  \ on her guitar. So I did, with my sorrow! I sang as best as I could and she went\
  \ to listen through the hole in the wall. She had shared a song or two and I tapped\
  \ along bewildered with her truth. So soothing was her voice and her sound a sanctuary.\
  \ From the rumbling road I had come forth sally. \n\nI had come through this town\
  \ many times before. But when you stop and meet someone for the first time, a world\
  \ within a world begins to surface and like stars joining a picture emerges. I saw\
  \ myself and this newfound friend upon a stage together singing country hymns. From\
  \ my daydream I woke again in the shop. She served a customer, I sat and played\
  \ with a 3D puzzle. My heart and mind leaped out the window to the blue sky and\
  \ white fluffy puff. As I looked down, there sat a business card on the table. Moore\
  \ Realty it read. Only my comprehension was of Moore Reality. As my newfound friend\
  \ came over I described the layers of its meaning. One message that was quite clear,\
  \ that of Morality. This sign is for both of us said her emotion. Deeper we went\
  \ sharing what this meeting had meant. A new found friend she found in me."
