Text: "50\xB0 22' 34.6404'' N, 4\xB0 8' 37.8276'' W, Plymouth, 2:00 PM.\nI had barely\
  \ been in England for an hour but I already had an appointment, with a local guy\
  \ named Lucas. As I waited on the sidewalk I started to examine every people coming\
  \ by trying to figure out if one of them could be my guy. I was so focused on my\
  \ task that I badly startled when a voice coming from behind me said \u201CHey!\
  \ You are Lucile, aren\u2019t you?\u201D\nLucas was a very tall and longilineal\
  \ man dressed in black from head to toe, hood on and even wearing sunglasses to\
  \ complete the costume. He looked like a secret agent or a star hiding from his\
  \ fans. Yet when he smiled at me I guessed there was just a nice English man behind\
  \ these sunglasses. \nIn the beginning I was so focused on our talk, anxious to\
  \ miss a word with his strong Cornish accent that I barely looked at the surroundings.\
  \ We were walking down long streets framed by series of residential houses with\
  \ their typical English porches when all of sudden, around the corner, we arrived\
  \ in an open space: the Seafront. There was nothing but a blue field of water before\
  \ us, isolating the UK from the continent. As I looked right I spotted a red and\
  \ white lighthouse and a little further a ferry similar to the one I took in the\
  \ morning. The sea breeze made me shiver but I was amused to see that most girls\
  \ around me were wearing light dresses or shorts while I was wrapped in a wool cardigan.\
  \ I shared my observation with Lucas and he told me \u201CCome on, here is the sunniest\
  \ place in England, it\u2019s our \u201DC\xF4te d\u2019Azur\u201D. And it\u2019\
  s summer girl, so there\u2019s nothing odd!\u201D We both laughed and decided to\
  \ head to the Barbican to find a place to eat. \nThe area was crowded and Lucas\u2019\
  s voice melted too often with the surrounding English brouhaha; I was losing the\
  \ train of his words. We paused in front of street musicians who played a joyful\
  \ folk tune and we swung gently with the crowd. Then we finally found the place\
  \ Lucas targeted: a Cornish Pasties\u2019 restaurant. I had no idea what a pasty\
  \ could be but I soon smell a tasty scent and discreetly eyed at our neighbour\u2019\
  s plates: they were like empanadas made of flaky pastry. My starving stomach approved.\n\
  As I sat there listening to seagulls calls and breathing the iodized air in front\
  \ of my new pal I felt good. It was as if I were at home even if I was on the other\
  \ side of the Channel. A small touch of excitation titillated my heart, reminding\
  \ me it was just the beginning of a new adventure..."
