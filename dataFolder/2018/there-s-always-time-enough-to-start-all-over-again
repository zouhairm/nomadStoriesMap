Text: "My history is about my travel back to Brazil. I consider it a travel, because\
  \ when you live abroad for a period of time (I mean, not as a tourist) and you have\
  \ to face the returning, that experience is kind of hard.\n The strange feeling\
  \ starts when you look to the clouds and think about  all that was left behind and\
  \ all the undefined that you're gonna face when back home. You feel that you achieved\
  \ your goals, but at the same time you find yourself in a blind spot: a new routine,\
  \ no job, the feeling that you're about to start all over again. In my case, I was\
  \ fast on looking for opportunities to achieve the goals that I had established\
  \ for me when coming back to Brazil.\n Before taking the decision to apply for the\
  \ au pair program in the USA, I worked as a math teacher in a traditional school,\
  \ but always dreamt of working in a bilingual one. However, the fact of being so\
  \ shy to speak in english just frustrated all the opportunities that I had until\
  \ then.\n After the program, I'm safe to speak in english and fortunately could\
  \ work in a great bilingual school. But, if you're feeling happy for me while reading\
  \ it, you can't miss what's coming next!\n The months were passing by and even doing\
  \ a great job, being loved by my students, and receiving the feedback that I always\
  \ expected, something started to go really wrong (and I had no idea about what was\
  \ that). I faced uncountable nights of insomnia, my health was completely messy,\
  \ and for some reason I wasn't happy anymore. It took me a long time trying to get\
  \ better and to understand what was happening, and then, during a class, it came\
  \ loud and clear to me: I wasn't born to be a teacher.\n Here, you will think: that's\
  \ easy, just quit and find another job. But, what to do when you spent the life\
  \ you had since now, investing your time and money to become an admirable teacher?\
  \ It's not an easy decision, but you know what, you're right! I did the best for\
  \ me, and quitted my job at the end of the year (yes, I was responsible until the\
  \ academic year ends).\n To finish my history, I can ensure that not being a teacher\
  \ anymore is the decision that pushed me to the edge. And why? That's simple: I\
  \ was about to sink in my own sadness, and now I feel alive, willing to travel the\
  \ world, and most important of it, show everybody who's reading it that there's\
  \ always time enough to start all over again and be happy. Never be afraid to change,\
  \ life is full of possibilities and you're capable of anything, trust yourself!"
