Text: "\u201CWhat does this say?\u201D Katy handed her phone displaying the phrase\
  \ \u03B2\u03C1\u03B5\u03AF\u03C4\u03B5 \u03C4\u03BF \u03AC\u03C0\u03B5\u03B9\u03C1\
  \u03BF to our waiter. Neither of us could read the Greek alphabet and we stared\
  \ at him with anticipation. An assortment of languages created a dynamic din surrounding\
  \ our own animated table of eight Americans. Cigarette smoke wafted through the\
  \ open alfresco ceiling of the traditional Greek restaurant into the heavy Mykonos\
  \ night air. Our waiter peered closely at Katy\u2019s phone, black curls falling\
  \ over dark eyes. \u201CIt says \u2018Find\u2026.\u2019\u201D he started, and unable\
  \ to articulate the proper word in English, threw his arms up and gestured to the\
  \ endlessly starry sky. Katy and I exchanged a knowing laugh and understood perfectly\
  \ what our Greek waiter meant: Find the Infinity. \n\nWe\u2019d been sailing the\
  \ Greek isles for the past four days in a catamaran aptly named The Zeus. Earlier\
  \ our quintessential Greek captain Babbos had pulled us into a cove named Super\
  \ Paradise. Katy wanted to explore a gorgeous boutique hotel, San Giorgio Mykonos,\
  \ on the cliff overlooking the sea. I offered to accompany her, and Babbos dropped\
  \ us off at a little wooden dock for us to hike up to the hotel. We toured the grounds\
  \ with a friendly caretaker. We were shown the garden, where vegetables were grown\
  \ for the restaurant and herbs were made into syrups for drinks at the tranquil\
  \ poolside bar. At the bar there was a chalkboard sign showing the three cocktail\
  \ options: The Holy Rose, Lord\u2019s Passion, and Find the Infinity. \n\n\u201C\
  Find the infinity,\u201D Katy and I both breathed to ourselves, then turned to each\
  \ other and exclaimed, \u201CFIND THE INFINITY!\u201D For some inexplicable reason,\
  \ this phrase meant something to us both. Maybe it was the same significance, maybe\
  \ different, but ultimately we decided we wanted to get tattoos of the phrase in\
  \ the Greek alphabet. Katy entered the phrase into a Greek translator in her phone\
  \ to show to a local, to ensure that before it was etched permanently on our bodies,\
  \ the translation meant what we thought it meant \u2013 which lead to the scene\
  \ in the Mykonos restaurant. Something inside me changed during the trip and the\
  \ discovery of this phrase. I was able to experience the connections, the freedom,\
  \ and frankly, the simple feeling of happiness that I hadn\u2019t even realized\
  \ were missing in my life. And this glimpse into something previously unknown left\
  \ me wanting more. I learned then that there are infinite opportunities, places\
  \ to see and experiences to have in this world. It is up to me to go find it."
