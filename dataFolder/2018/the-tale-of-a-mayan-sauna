Text: "We covered our pots, preserving the flavors and keeping our food warm, went\
  \ upstairs to change and soon after, came back down to the kitchen, wrapped in our\
  \ towels. Seeing as the sauna is rather small, it can only 'comfortably' fit four\
  \ people. We were the fifth and sixth persons, so we happily waited for our turn.\
  \ Besides, privacy for us would make the sauna much more satisfying - I say this\
  \ with a sense of practicality. After twenty (ish) minutes the first group began\
  \ to file out; one by one; each of them naked; each of them so utterly, completely\
  \ focused and content with what they had just felt and experienced. Each of them\
  \ radiating warmth, glowing with satisfaction and emulating a sense of happiness.\
  \ They all marched over to the outdoor shower, fully comfortable with one and other;\
  \ laughing and beaming with positivity; acting as though they had known each other\
  \ for decades...when in actuality, it had been less than a day. Eager to try this\
  \ magic sauna, I stripped down to the nude; Suz immediately behind me, and together\
  \ we crawled - yes, crawled - through a hole, similar to the door hobbits enter\
  \ in the shire, found what we could only assume was a seat and sat down; it was\
  \ eerily silent, pitch black and of course, hot. \nA Mayan sauna, in shape, or at\
  \ least for this one, was similar to an igloo; domed outer walls with a small hole\
  \ that acts as an entrance. The warmth comes from radiant heat that is produced\
  \ by a wood stove furnace; directly attached to the structure. Unlike the saunas\
  \ back home, all excess heat/ steam is released through a vent - making the process\
  \ of heating very progressive and long, but certainly potent when it reaches its\
  \ full potential. There is no light, except for ominous red candles that glow in\
  \ the corners, sounds are well regulated and kept to a minimum and the height of\
  \ the entire sauna is merely three feet - your head literally grazes the roof, even\
  \ when you sit. It is an experience everyone must endure at some point in their\
  \ lives. Now, our first session was very enjoyable. We loved it. There's something\
  \ truly gratifying about saunas; the release of toxins, opening of pores, burning\
  \ of calories, and cleansing of skin are all good for purifying and recharging our\
  \ body, mind, and soul. We felt sensational. All was well. It's when we got out;\
  \ that's when things started to get weird, go sideways and so began the origins\
  \ of my discomfort.\ncamducketttravel.wixsite.com/camduckett/single-post/2016/11/04/The-Tale-of-a-Mayan-Sauna"
