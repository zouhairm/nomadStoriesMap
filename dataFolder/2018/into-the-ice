Text: "I quit my job at the end of 2016, spent a few weeks traveling around the U.S.A\
  \ before going to Poland with my friend, Bo. I spent my time in nature. I saw the\
  \ leaves turn in Blue Ridge, Georgia. I caught trout in the clear waters of the\
  \ Caney Fork River in Tennessee. I fell asleep under the stars and woke to hang\
  \ gliders in Alabama. \n\nWe flew to Prague and took a bus to Poland. In Prague,\
  \ we stayed at the Mad Hatter hostel and experienced Prague's energetic nightlife.\
  \ We walked around the city center and drank hot plum wine while waiting on the\
  \ Astral Clock to sound -  it is actually disappointing unless you take pleasure\
  \ in watching people stand around for 30 minutes to only have their expectations\
  \ crushed.\n\nI was the happiest I could remember. No job, no worries, and enough\
  \ money to make it through a year without working. But I didn't know what I was\
  \ going to do once I returned home. What I would learn in Poland would help me make\
  \ decisions.\n\nThe first day in Poland was a turning point for me. Sixty-two people\
  \ met the night before and woke up eager and excited to study the Wim Hof Method.\
  \ Little did we know what we had signed up for. After a relaxing morning our instructors\
  \ told us to change into a bathing suit only and meet outside, in below freezing\
  \ weather without shoes or shirts. After a couple hours of walking around outside\
  \ through the woods and playing some games we returned proud and shivering. We took\
  \ turns in the sauna and forgot  how cold it was outside. \n\nAfter lunch our instructors\
  \ had us put on warm clothes over a bathing suit. Not thinking much about it we\
  \ followed along, nice and warm, through the snow lined paths, over the gravel that\
  \ had previously bit into our feet and came to a waterfall. We were all in disbelief\
  \ until the instructors told us to chose a partner, we were going into the pool\
  \ of the waterfall. Bo and I had been divided into different groups so the Spanish\
  \ girl standing next to me and I paired up. \n\nWe stumbled over frozen stones,\
  \ bodies numb, minds in disbelief that we were walking into sub freezing water.\
  \ Once we reached the water our feet were already numb so it took me a couple more\
  \ steps to realize how cold it was. As the water passed my waist I started to have\
  \ trouble breathing. My mind was in a panic. Every part of me wanted to run but\
  \ I forced myself into shoulder high water and my body allowed me to breath again.\
  \ It was painfully cold but it showed all of us our inner strength and ability to\
  \ overcome obstacles."
