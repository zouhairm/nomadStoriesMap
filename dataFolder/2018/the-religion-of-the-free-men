Text: "That day the weather was chilly, and I was sitting in a terrace with three\
  \ others. Two of them were Moroccan, plus my cousin and I. We were talking about\
  \ religion, and as you may know, you have to watch out when you talk about subjects\
  \ like those, because people can get offended. \n\nIn fact, I did offend them. Don't\
  \ get me wrong, I was the one defending the religion, not them. I, the Spaniard,\
  \ was defending my belief that something greater than us exist. For them, there\
  \ was nothing judging their acts or taking care of their steps.\n\nIn that terrace,\
  \ with the wind moving the tent, we felt free to talk. We met by mistake. We were\
  \ simply two Spaniards traveling around Morocco with no money, smiles on our faces\
  \ and blind faith in the people. It was in that moment that I realised the value\
  \ exchange we were offering. They were opening the door of their houses for us,\
  \ and in exchange we were giving them freedom of speech, with no judgement.\n\n\
  We stayed together for almost the whole trip because they became our friends. They\
  \ had friends and family in almost every place we visited, and they always had someone\
  \ waiting for us at the bus stop, to take us to his house, to offer us home cooked\
  \ food, a place to sleepand a revealing conversation.\n\nI learned about the Berber\
  \ culture. Berber means wild man, and that is how Arabs called the people living\
  \ in the Atlas mountains when Morocco was colonized. On the other side, Berber call\
  \ themselves free men, and that was how they felt before colonization. I learned\
  \ how the French language was imposed to the Berber culture, as France helped the\
  \ Arab government fight against the free men, and how suddenly two languages were\
  \ imposed in a country which didn\u2019t belong to them. Berber was delegated as\
  \ a non-official language.\n\nI learned so much. I focused myself on absorbing and\
  \ swallowing as much knowledge as possible, because that was the only thing they\
  \ were asking me to do for them. They didn't need to ask me with words, I could\
  \ understand what they wanted, and they wanted this message to flow, for people\
  \ to know that Moroccans are not just Arabs, and that a bigger culture exists behind\
  \ the curtain.\n\nI could see in the eyes of the free men how important their culture\
  \ was, and I tried my best to honour them by focusing on the little things. So,\
  \ next time you go to Morocco, ask the waiter for a tea with a lot of kaskusha,\
  \ which means foam in Berber language, and enjoy the taste of freedom."
