Text: "The US is already quite a different place from Europe. Cars are bigger, roads\
  \ are bigger, food is bigger, people are bigger, distances are bigger, EVERYTHING\
  \ is bigger. That's why me and my friend Elena decided to get a 7 hours Megabus\
  \ from the crowded and warm Los Angeles to the quirky and - hopefully - smaller\
  \ San Francisco, to experience another side of California. We did not know what\
  \ was going to happen to us. \n\nIt was warm, and I am talking boiling hot warm\
  \ to the point that we were red as shrimps because of the sunburn and all we wanted\
  \ was to sit on an air-conditioned bus and head to our hostel in San Fran, which\
  \ was waiting for us at 8pm. We got on the bus, fought for our seats and quickly\
  \ run out of water. The journey begun, so we put our earphones in, pulled down our\
  \ sleeping masks and we couldn't have been more eager to get to our destination.\
  \ But fate wasn't on our side that day. \n\nAfter three hours on the road - and\
  \ literally having just made our first petrol stop of the drive - the driver pulled\
  \ over on the side of what a giant sign said was Harris Ranch. All of us looked\
  \ at each other very confused, until he awkwardly announced to the speakers that\
  \ there was something wrong with the engine or tires of the bus and he had been\
  \ instructed from his HQ to pull over and wait for a mechanic which was - the closest\
  \ one I mean - 3 hours away. We all looked outside at the desert-like surroundings\
  \ and, with a sigh, started to try and get over the smell of cow that was coming\
  \ from our neighbour.\n\nAfter the warmest 4 and a half hours of our lives the mechanic\
  \ came. He had a look at the bus and, shaking his head, said we couldn't continue\
  \ as a tire was broken. We could either wait for a tireman (4 hours away) or wait\
  \ for a rescue bus (which was apparently 3 hours away). We choose the latter. \n\
  \nTime was just not going by, but our stomach was definitely feeling it. Me and\
  \ Elena were starving, and the only thing Harris Ranch served was meat and, for\
  \ us two vegans, that meant starving. We bought an apple from the small local store\
  \ who apparently only sold jerk meat and apples. And we waited. For 6 hours. When\
  \ we started to lose our hope - and we had seen the sun setting and the stars coming\
  \ out - the bus showed up. It was 11pm. By the time we got to our hostel almost\
  \ in tears of joy it was 3am. We begged the uber driver to stop at a 7/11 to get\
  \ something to eat only to find out the hostel kitchen was closed. We hate raw courgette\
  \ and hummus. What a journey."
