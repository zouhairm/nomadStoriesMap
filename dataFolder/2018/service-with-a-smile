Text: "We were just about to embark on the Trans-Siberian railway and for one of our\
  \ last meals prior to the week long journey across Siberia, we trekked across Saint\
  \ Petersburg to try Georgian food. It was a scene many travelers will be familiar\
  \ with as we traipsed past countless restaurant options, our stomachs beginning\
  \ to growl ever more assertively. The conversation between us had died a death as\
  \ our brains fixated on priority number one: must eat now.\n\nPraying our guidebook\
  \ would come good, we finally arrived at our destination. We walked straight past\
  \ the inconspicuous and uninviting restaurant exterior. There was an eery empty\
  \ stage in the dusty restaurant, no other customers, and we weren't sure if they\
  \ were even open. No staff were present and we edged our way inside anxiously.\n\
  \nOut popped an effervescent man who greeted us with a typically brash and hostile\
  \ welcome. No smiles, just a glare. This only added to our awful first impression,\
  \ which was topped off when he refused to serve us the beer we so desperately needed.\
  \ Let's eat and leave. Get this over with.\n\nMr. Comedian eventually burst out\
  \ laughing after 15 minutes of this hilarious charade, a smile broke out across\
  \ his face, and he brought us two beers as he finally took our extremely ambitious\
  \ food order. It is safe to say we hadn't yet got to grips with Russian humour.\n\
  \nWhat arrived was a tradition Georgian Khachapuri dish, which was described as\
  \ a bread boat on the menu. We were too curious to resist. What the menu didn't\
  \ say was that this bread boat could probably sail across the sea to Finland with\
  \ a 4 man crew if push came to shove. It was big, and it was strong. \n\nThe crust\
  \ on this oval shaped boat was about two inches thick, and the centre was filled\
  \ with a foot long pool of melted cheese and raw egg. The highlight of the show\
  \ was when our man once again descended upon us to scramble the egg into the cheesy\
  \ mess in the centre of our boat. The giant creation was just waiting to be torn\
  \ apart and to burn the roofs of our mouths. \n\nAfter a valliant effort on our\
  \ part, our favourite waiter returned, pointed at me, clenched his jaw, and said:\n\
  \n\"I am not letting you leave until you finish this. You. Not her. You.\" \n\n\
  I laughed nervously, remembering how funny he'd been earlier in the night, and tried\
  \ my best.\n\nI did finish it, but only after snacking on the remains for the following\
  \ two days. It wasn't exactly service with a smile, but on a cold Baltic night,\
  \ our man's Khachapuri hit the spot."
