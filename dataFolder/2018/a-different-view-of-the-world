Text: "He\u2019s wearing a faded shirt with Pop-eye on it. Short dark hair and missing\
  \ a few of his teeth. He\u2019s running barefoot down the street towards us with\
  \ others in tow, a little girl in a dirty sundress, a small boy in a yellow jersey\
  \ with a piece of fruit in his hands and a dozen others. They kick up a dust cloud\
  \ behind them. The van I\u2019m in comes to a stop on the corner and the doors slide\
  \ open. We are greeted with the smiling children and their raised hands, palms facing\
  \ the sky. We unload the medical supplies and plastic tub full of soup. The children\
  \ line up with bowls and cups of various sizes and colors waiting patiently for\
  \ their turn to scoop out what they can. The elderly follow and the adults bring\
  \ up the rear. The world seems to slow as I struggle to take in a new view. One\
  \ that is not filled with the wealth that western world seems to vomit forth. As\
  \ I refocus, one of the children has come up to me and taken my hand. He lightly\
  \ pulls me down the uneven, dirt road towards where the other children are kicking\
  \ a ball. Each laughing and yelling as they receive it. I join in, as do some of\
  \ the other volunteers. All of us laughing and running with the children. This is\
  \ an escape. They don\u2019t have to worry about chores,  when they will eat next,\
  \ or how they will survive in a world they do not fully understand. In these moments,\
  \ they can enjoy being kids and enjoy freedom that comes with it. One of them, the\
  \ one with the piece of fruit, has stayed off to the side. He watches the older\
  \ boys run but seems perfectly content to hang on tightly to that fruit. It is not\
  \ until I start picking the kids up and spinning them that he decides to join the\
  \ group, making sure he has safely set his fruit next to a broken fence to ensure\
  \ that it will not get smashed. He makes his way over, arms raised, ready for his\
  \ turn to soar through the sky. Afterwards he runs to collect his fruit, giggling\
  \ as he makes his way down the street away from us, only looking back to wave. Through\
  \ the dust clouds to the end of the street and out of sight. I wander towards the\
  \ van, taking a moment to look back. One of the boys, Pop-eye shirt, has come to\
  \ see us off. With his broken English, he wishes me well and his hope to see me\
  \ again. I put my hat on his head and tell him the same. I would make multiple trips\
  \ back to this little town. I have yet to see the boy with the Pop-eye shirt or\
  \ the one who coveted that piece of fruit but I have hope that I will cross paths\
  \ with them again one day."
