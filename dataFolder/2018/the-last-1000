Text: "I got dumped. I am broke. The travel fund is empty.\n \nRealization #1: I cannot\
  \ keep traveling on my own the way I had been as a couple the last year; #2, I possibly\
  \ cannot keep traveling at all. I had no plan B to begin with, no safety net. For\
  \ four months, I have been sustaining myself by volunteering at a guesthouse for\
  \ accommodation and eating free food at a Sikh Temple while I come up with a plan.\
  \ I also had to borrow $1000 while I turn myself back around. This is the last thing\
  \ I expected.\n \nSometimes, it takes me hitting rock bottom to realize that I need\
  \ to take measures to change a situation. I don\u2019t know how much more rock bottom\
  \ things can get right now. The thing that I dreaded happening when it hadn\u2019\
  t happened has happened. One thing I am asking myself a lot right now is: how much\
  \ does one need to be happy? As I\u2019m finding out, the answer is: not a lot.\
  \ \n \nAnd so, rather than buying a flight home with the last $1000 and come home\
  \ defeated, I\u2019ve decided to dare myself to grow. I bought a bicycle. The plan\
  \ is to cycle to Europe.\n \nI have fundamentally always been a conformist. I defined\
  \ myself by my job, by what I did, what I looked like. I worked not only to define\
  \ this mind-made self, but also to maintain some form of security for the future\
  \ and to save enough to allow me to travel. We\u2019re all guilty on different levels\
  \ of building our lives for the future, along the way forgetting that we live in\
  \ the present. But does seeking security for the future bring us happiness in the\
  \ now? \n \nEverything is impermanent. At one point, we are bound to lose everything:\
  \ our family, our partner, our money, our job, our own life. What will there be\
  \ left when everything else goes? The world is not a safe and comfortable place.\
  \ It is full of challenges and hurts and to think that we can ride it unharmed is\
  \ a misconception.\n \nSo I\u2019m stepping out of my comfort zone. I have decided\
  \ to let go, look at all this uncertainty right in the fucking eyes. It sounds scary\
  \ and crazy, and in some ways it is, but it was one of the simplest decisions I\
  \ ever made. There never was a plan B.\n \nI want to challenge myself, see what\
  \ I am made of, and live so fully that it will hurt me to leave when it\u2019s all\
  \ over. I want to show myself that nothing really matters as much as I used to believe\
  \ and that I am an infinitely small part of a greater whole. The universe has got\
  \ my back. Our hours are counted and the best we can do is to stop worrying and\
  \ ride this great big wave called life."
