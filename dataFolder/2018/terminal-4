Text: "It was just days before Christmas 2007 and Heathrow Terminal 4 was in chaotic\
  \ madness. Last-minute shoppers were running around the terminal trying to find\
  \ the perfect holiday gifts for their loved ones, coffee addicts were queuing for\
  \ what look like miles to try the new Starbucks Peppermint Latte, and passengers\
  \ were wondering if they ever going to board their flight.  And let\u2019s not even\
  \ get started on the cheesy Christmas jingles that were apparently on replay since\
  \ early hours. But Nadia took no notice of it. She was listening to the \u2018Best\
  \ of Motown\u2019 on her new I-pod. Marvin Gaye was currently playing\u2026\u201D\
  and I heard it through the grapevine\u201D. Classic. This was Nadia\u2019s third\
  \ year at Oxford University and like every Christmas holiday, she was queuing at\
  \ the bag drop of Air France to head back home to Paris. She loved her university\
  \ course and charming Oxforshire, but the holidays could not have come at a better\
  \ time. She was exhausted and homesick. There she was lost in sounds of Motown when\
  \ suddenly she felt a tap on her shoulder. Startled, Nadia turned around and took\
  \ off her earphones. A red-eyed lady, apparently from crying, and dressed in a blue\
  \ Punjabi outfit was looking right at her. She looked upset, tired, with baggies\
  \ under her eyes and biting her lips. \u201CExcuse me, but do you think you can\
  \ please look after my suitcase for a few minutes?\u201D said the lady to Nadia\
  \ in a strong Punjabi accent. Since 9/11, passengers were always told to be wary\
  \ of unsupervised luggage or any suspicious activity. And Nadia knew that. But Nadia\
  \ could tell the lady was desperate for help, for a bit of love. \u201CUhhh sure.\
  \ But where are you going?\u201D replied Nadia. Tears started to flow from the lady\u2019\
  s eyes, and in a shaky voice, she replied \u201CTo the bathroom\u201D. And off she\
  \ went. Nadia felt awkward and a bit nervous but she felt the lady\u2019s pain.\
  \ Sure enough, just a short while later, the lady came back and thanked Nadia with\
  \ a hug. Nadia felt even more awkward. The lady noticed right away. She smiled.\
  \ She noticed Nadia\u2019s young age and understood this must have been an awkward,\
  \ unexpected situation for her. But she was obviously a generous, kind young lady.\
  \ \u201CThank you so much. Let me buy you coffee. I could do with some company before\
  \ boarding for Karachi. My name is Salma\u201D. Nadia was not sure how to respond\
  \ but felt she could not turn down the kind offer. Plus she seemed genuinely nice.\
  \ \u201COh right. Thank you, Salma. I\u2019m Nadia.\u201D This was the start of\
  \ an unlikely friendship."
