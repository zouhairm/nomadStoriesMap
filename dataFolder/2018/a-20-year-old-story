Text: "I was thirty-one years old when I visit Chile, back in 92. My brother was making\
  \ a world trip with his boy friend. He is one of those persons that could be a member\
  \ on the club of the 100. A club that in the 60\u2019s & 70\u2019s meant that you\
  \ have visit 100 countries. Something that is easier to fulfill now a day. And where\
  \ many of his countries have another name. Chile was and is Chile, although was\
  \ at that time the Chile of Pinochet. I was leaving in Buenos Aires. I just broke\
  \ up with the love of my live. Can we still say that? Can I still say that? \n\n\
  He planned this trip not to contradict the Flat Earth Theory. Just part of his interest\
  \ of seen new places, meeting different people. Gosh if you just think that he was\
  \ 15 when he traveled to USA and you see a 15-year-old boy today. It looks like\
  \ we were different in character, in interest, in human relations\u2026 My other\
  \ sister, closer to the age of my brother, tells me that as a kid he used to take\
  \ a planisphere and tell her: I gonna go here and here and there\u2026 And he did.\
  \ \n\nWe flight from Buenos Aires to Mendoza. We knew that some taxis cross you\
  \ to Santiago. The price was cheap for somebody that work in Zurich. They even decide\
  \ not to wait for a fourth person to make it cheaper. An old Chevy SS. My brother\
  \ in the front, his friend and I in the back.\n\nI had flying in 2015 from Lima\
  \ to Buenos Aires on a day time. It flights on the cost line and around Atacama\
  \ take direction south-east. Los Andes at that point are high and dry. It is like\
  \ that until Santiago. Where we cross the road was OK, sometimes gravel paths. You\
  \ still can call them mountains but the passages are naturally low. All the days\
  \ that it took San Martin to cross the Cordillera, south from the Paso Cristo Redentor,\
  \ it took us just 3 hrs. This crossing today is used to buy cheaper goods. So you\
  \ can be surprise with a 4 hours\u2019 waiting line. \n\nIt was a November weather\
  \ in Santiago. There Spanish differs from the Argentinian only in the intonation.\
  \ We have a triple room in the 4 stars Hotel just across from El Palacio de la Moneda.\
  \ Exactly were in 1973, Allende, first socialist president elected in South America\
  \ was kick out from office for Pinochet. The kick included his murder. I still have\
  \ in my retina the b&w photo where he holds in his hands a machine gun, present\
  \ from Fidel Castro. I could see the difference on the fa\xE7ade from the Palacio\
  \ where a plane drops a bomb. \n\nto be continue"
