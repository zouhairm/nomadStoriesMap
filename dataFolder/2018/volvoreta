Text: "Fuerteventura, Canary Islands, summer of 2015. A group of volunteering people\
  \ was coming into a nursing home carrying the best medicine, Music. I was one of\
  \ them; my drug? A drum. After singing a huge music repertoire, we decided that\
  \ we should talk to those who had so much to tell. I approached a woman who had\
  \ been looking quietly at us from an armchair. Why her? I could never tell, but\
  \ it was magical.\n\nShe was ninety, and when I started to talk to her I never got\
  \ a verbal answer. A nurse came and told me that my new friend was Isabel, and she\
  \ was Galician. She also said that although she had lived in the Canary Islands\
  \ for almost her whole life, the last years she had only spoken Galician. It\u2019\
  s intriguing how Time plays with the brain. I could only speak Spanish and English,\
  \ I had always been pretty proud of that, but apparently it wasn\u2019t helpful\
  \ in that moment. I was sad we couldn\u2019t communicate; something inside made\
  \ me want to see her smile. So, that\u2019s exactly what I was determined to do.\
  \ I decided to use the oldest language ever spoken, the one that can be traced back\
  \ almost to the beginning of the human being. I grabbed my little drum and started\
  \ to play it while I was humming; then I handed the drum to her and she started\
  \ to play it too. There were no words, only percussion, music and laughter.  \n\n\
  \ And suddenly the rhythmic beats of our duet made me remember. I did know a Galician\
  \ word. I stopped humming, smiled looking proudly at her and raised my palms toward\
  \ my face, crossed them and put my thumbs together. My voice formed the word \u201C\
  Volvoreta\u201D while my hands started to flap. With one of the most genuine smiles\
  \ I had ever seen, she copied me and said the Galician word that means \u201Cbutterfly\u201D\
  .\n\nAnd miraculously, she began to sing. And her song wasn\xB4t in Galician, it\
  \ was in Spanish. With tears filling my eyes I started to play my little drum. She\
  \ kept singing, song after song, some of them unknown to me, some not. The nurses\
  \ were in awe because of what was happening in that room. \nAfter two hours, we\
  \ had to say goodbye. I was never going to see her again, I was leaving the Canary\
  \ Islands in two days, but there was not a trace of sadness in me. I hugged her\
  \ sincerely and I left. But before I went through the door, I turned around and\
  \ did the \u201CVolvoreta\u201D, and she did the same. We smiled. I had tried to\
  \ make Isabel enjoy that evening, but I never expected that the joy she felt it\
  \ was just a small piece compare to the happiness that she had given to me."
