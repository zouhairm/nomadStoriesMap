Text: "I\u2019m high on a ridge in the mountains. It\u2019s 2AM and my headlamp flickers\
  \ \u2013 the warning sign that the batteries are low. I have no idea where I am;\
  \ a speck of light moving across an island in the Atlantic. I can feel the dark\
  \ of the mountains around me and I know that I still have forever to go. \n It\u2019\
  s hard to say when dawn came. A different rhythm takes hold and I hardly notice\
  \ that it\u2019s a new day. A bank of clouds rolls into the valley below. I have\
  \ not slept but I\u2019m wide awake as I drop down to the village of Encumeada where\
  \ I can finally get some real food. Cup after cup, my body soaks up the soup that\
  \ a volunteer is ladling out. The chef-de-post brings me to a runner who\u2019s\
  \ dropping. The night has beaten him to a pulp but he manages a smile as he gives\
  \ me three batteries. I skip down the trail to the pines below. It feels like a\
  \ dance though soon enough I know I\u2019m going to be climbing again. I\u2019ve\
  \ made it through the night and now I have all day to cross the mountains of Madeira.\
  \ A rope runs along the side of the trail and a gully falls away to my right. I\u2019\
  m running towards a wall of granite. How do I get around it? No idea. Just follow\
  \ the trail and the answer will come. Hours later I\u2019m in a different valley\
  \ facing a different peak. \n Midday at the school gymnasium in Curral das Freiras.\
  \ I struggle to stand upright after bending down. I eat some chocolate but I\u2019\
  m weak and scared of what\u2019s to come. I see Patrick, Simon and Janie; the Swedes\
  \ I met at the start-line twelve hours ago \u2013 high-fiving each other as they\
  \ head out into the heat again. I feel very much alone. It will be a long time before\
  \ I make it to Pico Ruivo. Between the sinews of valleys I can see the ocean on\
  \ the horizon. This is the heart of the trail where beauty and suffering are one.\
  \ My mind knows that there is still forever to go. Bizarrely, the aid-station below\
  \ the summit has a little store. Grimed with sweat and dirt, I stand there dreading\
  \ the reply to my question. I can\u2019t believe it! They have triple-A batteries\
  \ for my headlamp. I make the most of the setting sun before being swallowed by\
  \ the night once again. \n At 4AM \u2013 thirty hours and 115 km after setting off\
  \ from the other side of the island \u2013 I can see the lights of Machico at the\
  \ end of the trail. I have almost crossed the island. Janie is in front of me. \u201C\
  Hello Sweden!\u201D I shout. She tries to smile. Everyone hurts. At the end of the\
  \ last descent I reach the asphalt. People are clapping and I\u2019m trying hard\
  \ not to cry."
