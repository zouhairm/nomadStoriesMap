Text: "\u201CSometimes you feel insignificant, but then you walk on these lands and\
  \ it lifts you up. You realize everything is connected and that you are as important\
  \ to the planet and is it to you,\u201D says master basket weaver April Churchill\
  \ Davis.\n\nDavis gingerly glides her dainty fingers over a spruce branch as she\
  \ intertwines the history of basket weaving with that of Haida Gwaii, a remote archipelago\
  \ in British Columbia, Canada. The strength and longevity of the spruce interwoven\
  \ into goods used by the Haida people symbolizes that of the islands and their indigenous\
  \ inhabitants, both of which have been brought back to life after near depletion.\n\
  \nOnce you step foot on these islands, blanketed with lush, mossy, enchanted forests,\
  \ white sandy beaches that stretch for miles with nary a soul, and totem poles that\
  \ tell tales for days, you sense a spirit that lifts and transports you back in\
  \ time. To a time as far back as possibly 13,000 years ago when the native Haida\
  \ people first inhabited these islands and developed a culture deeply connected\
  \ to the land and sea. They built longhouses and totem poles to signify their lineage\
  \ as they developed a rich culture on the more than 100 island villages they once\
  \ occupied. \n\n\u201CThese villages were exceptionally vibrant before contact was\
  \ made,\u201D says local resident Jag Brown. \n\nYou hear the term \u201Ccontact\u201D\
  \ repeatedly while exploring the islands. In 1774, Haida Gwaii was visited by the\
  \ first European. Before colonial contact, the population was roughly 10,000. \n\
  \nBrown stands before the site of a former longhouse nestled between giant cedar\
  \ and spruce trees. Almost 90 percent of the population died during the 1800s from\
  \ smallpox and other diseases, he says. By 1900, approximately 300-350 people remained\
  \ and colonizers took over. Haida Gwaii, which means \u201CIslands of the people,\u201D\
  \ was a former British colony_an invasion that brought war, brutality, and residential\
  \ schools.\n\n\"After the invaders arrival, it was forbidden to raise totem poles\
  \ or practice our culture or language. It numbed generations but we are starting\
  \ to recover,\u201D says the spirited Joelle Rabu.  \n\nAs I listen to elders tell\
  \ their tales on these remote lands, sorrow sweeps over me as a displaced person\
  \ who left my birthplace of Kenya many years ago. But the spirit of the people and\
  \ lands gives me hope for their future. These emotions overwhelm me almost as much\
  \ as the beauty of this sacred land and leave me feeling more connected to a country\
  \ I now call home."
