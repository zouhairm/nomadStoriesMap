Text: "My conscience about travelling is more about staying grounded to your roots\
  \ rather than having a wayward over adventurous beliefs. This doesn't mean that\
  \ you exclude the excitement part. Being excited and joyous about what is to come\
  \ is always a big positive but it's about a small thing that I have learnt,\n\"\
  If you want to enjoy being around the world, you first need to be a connoisseur\
  \ of your own backyard\"\n\nI am born & brought up in Mumbai. I've heard elderly\
  \ people around me since my childhood saying that this is the most busiest city\
  \ of our country, \" Mumbai never stops \". Listening to all those aspects, I never\
  \ gave a thought to it but while I grew up I understood it by my own experiences.\
  \ I come from a middle class family who had to shift away for two years from Mumbai,\
  \ not so far but on the outskirts of the city. Thanks to the demolition of my previous\
  \ residence in order to re-establish a new one. Unfortunately it hasn't started\
  \ yet and the builder is still playing around with the procedures. \n\nThe place\
  \ I shifted to is called Badlapur. Can be easily called an emerging place which\
  \ might soon be known as a proper city in the near future. People get up early,\
  \ catch trains and go towards Mumbai for their daily routine and jobs. They come\
  \ back late and either have a drink or two near the railway station or just quietly\
  \ walk back to their homes and sleep.\nI was doing my bachelor's at that time and\
  \ from the word go I started hating each and everything about that place. Very seldom,\
  \ got out of the house and wasn't willing to live in this place for more time. \n\
  I always loved my city but moving to Badlapur I understood how much I am crazy and\
  \ addicted to Mumbai. The speed and mainly the feel of the place is just unimaginable.\
  \ I have travelled to places like Manali, Vadodara, South India and would love to\
  \ visit as many places possible in my lifetime. But coming back to where you belong\
  \ is the utmost important thing in a travellers life. It's the same feeling that\
  \ you get when you start packing your bags for a pleasureful trip.\n\nEventually,\
  \ with some efforts I got back to the place I loved the most. It took two years\
  \ but I got back. We live in a rented apartment, leaving our own house behind. But\
  \ gives immense pleasure and peace to the mind and soul.\nSometimes it's impossible\
  \ to know where you are headed without reflecting on where you have come from. Understanding\
  \ your heritage, roots and ancestry is an important part of carving your future.\
  \ Period !!"
