Text: "Mao hops like a mountain goat up the side of the hill while I suck wind behind\
  \ her. I have to remind myself to look up. After all, what is the point of climbing\
  \ a mountain if you don\u2019t take in the view?  I stop to soak up long valley\
  \ beneath us. Dirt paths fork like lightning up the mountains- between the muddy\
  \ rice paddies. A long cloud meanders along the bottom of the valley and covers\
  \ the base of the mountains- giving the illusion that the earth we are standing\
  \ on is floating high in the air. Mao is a Hmong woman who has spent most of her\
  \ life in the valley village and is guiding me on our hike. She has stopped to converse\
  \ with two farmers who are giggling at the awed expression (and likely the tomato-like\
  \ complexion) on my face. Clearly this spectacular view of nature is nothing out\
  \ of the ordinary for them.\n\nMao speaks to the farmers, who smile and give me\
  \ an approving nod. \"I told them that you are a teacher,\" Mao translates excitedly.\
  \ She has been doing her best to convince me to move to Northern Vietnam to teach.\
  \ The school in her village was built just five years ago. Prior to it\u2019s construction,\
  \ there was no formal education system here. I smile as I consider for a moment\
  \ how many of my students in Canada would feel about this situation: \u201CNo school\
  \ would be awesome!\u201D, \u201CWhen are we ever going to use this stuff anyways!?\u201D\
  \ I smile as I picture them eagerly discussing what they would do if they weren\u2019\
  t burdened with the responsibilities that come with becoming educated. \n\nNot long\
  \ after we've left the farmers, three children- about 7-10 years old appear on the\
  \ path. Their backpacks are too big and hit the back of their legs as they walk.\
  \ They take turns jumping and balancing on the mounds of clay built up to contain\
  \ the water in each paddy. I think of my own childhood, jumping like this from snow\
  \ banks on the street and I recognize the universal innocence of children.\n\n \u201C\
  Are they skipping school?\u201D I ask Mao, confused. \u201COh no,\u201D she laughs,\
  \ \u201CThey are just walking home for lunch!\u201D I turn to look back at the school:\
  \ a tiny block down in the valley. The oldest child nudges her brother and points\
  \ to a house, about 100 steep meters down the mountain amid the paddies. I watch\
  \ in amazement as they casually hop down from ledge to ledge until they are at their\
  \ house. These children scale a mountain twice a day to attend school. Mao giggles\
  \ at the awed expression on my face. Clearly this perspective of education is nothing\
  \ out of the ordinary for them."
