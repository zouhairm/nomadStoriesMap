Text: "In September 2017 I flew with my partner Tristan to Buenos Aires to visit my\
  \ family as it was many years since I last saw them. Therefore, it was a very exciting\
  \ trip for both of us because I would introduce Tristan to them. I lived in Buenos\
  \ Aires for many years and it was a very dirty and dangerous place. There were lots\
  \ of bad things that did not improve like transport and safety. I gave a big hug\
  \ to my parents when they picked up us from the Airport and on the way to my parents'\
  \ apartment, they explained to us that Buenos Aires improved a lot. I told my Dad,\
  \ \" The last thing I expected was to find a city so well looked after and improved\
  \ in so many ways\".  My Dad said: \"Yes, is incredible and you will enjoy travelling\
  \ by bus as they have been upgraded\". \n\nOn Saturday Tristan, my parents and I\
  \ visited the bookshop \"El Ateneo Grand Splendid\",  the second most beautiful\
  \ bookshop in the world. Tristan and I took a book and sat down in one of the boxes\
  \ as my Mum took us some lovely photos. We were both impressed at how beautiful\
  \ this bookstore is and enjoyed our visit.  Afterwards we went to visit Recoleta\
  \ Cemetery where we wandered through the last resting place for many of Buenos Aires'\
  \ most influential people. On Sunday, Tristan and I took the bus to Plaza de Mayo,\
  \ the political hub of Buenos Aires where the Casa Rosada (Pink House) is located\
  \ and that houses the office of the President. We reserved a free guided tour in\
  \ English and enjoyed it as the guide was excellent, explaining every single detail\
  \ about each part of the Casa Rosada. It is one of the must see attractions of Buenos\
  \ Aires.\n \nOn Monday, 18 September 2017, we flew with my parents to Iguazu in\
  \ one of Aerolineas Argentinas  newest aircraft Boeing 737/800. We enjoyed the flight\
  \ as the service was excellent and had a wonderful trip for three days in Iguazu.\
  \ Back in Buenos Aires we appreciated how special, stylish, beautiful, creative\
  \ and unforgettable this city is. Sexy and alive, this beautiful city gets under\
  \ your skin and has become a big hit with growing numbers of foreigners who visit\
  \ Buenos Aires. I am very happy to have seen so many improvements in my hometown\
  \ like seeing more policemen which makes it a safer place to visit. The President\
  \ of Argentina transformed this city into an attractive destination for tourists\
  \ to visit. I hope all the readers of my character travel story enjoyed reading\
  \ it and that you will visit Buenos Aires one day soon."
