Text: "When I decided to journey out to a place not known to me four years ago, I\
  \ had never anticipated myself amongst a society so immersed in its soul.  When\
  \ knocking at the future\u2019s doors, I had seldom prepared for the wonders of\
  \ the city of Cape Town to welcome an ordinary girl from the dusty roads of King\
  \ William\u2019s Town. \nFor every time the moment of truth comes, I always opt\
  \ for what the soul desires. I now find myself amongst the finest of human beings\
  \ who thrive to deliver. If I had known, I would have prepared a daily kindle for\
  \ my humour. As I\u2019d be walking about the streets of a city so unknown, it spoke\
  \ to my heart a language of only three words: Love, humanity and success.  \nThe\
  \ Mother City made it far too easy for one to observe the relationship between passions\
  \ and drive to become better. Its walls yelled to me a sound of freedom as I saw\
  \ daring graffiti stuck perfectly against it. It motivated my right mind to believe\
  \ that it was home. \nIn fact, leaving home in search for a destiny not known to\
  \ me was a chance most of us small town lovers could not do. It instilled hope within\
  \ my family that my return would be fruitful. Little had I known that I\u2019d encounter\
  \ most challenges a young person barely does, fighting for a chance to serve as\
  \ a voice in media. I like to consider myself as one standing out as a cultured\
  \ young woman in a modernised realm. \nEven though the need to succeed pushed me\
  \ to the edge, I had to try harder to keep myself within my love for the villages\
  \ and admired the spirit which wove together all the people. Being a city mover\
  \ allowed a concentrated observation of how other people lived. \nOften the living\
  \ conditions would be appalling but people prevailed. I had to realize the developmental\
  \ inequality around me. When travelling forty kilometres away from the city, reality\
  \ then introduced itself as means of homelessness and poverty. Yet again, I was\
  \ from a dusty town but was never affected by that. It was hard to believe that\
  \ most of the people who had been pushed to the edge to leaving what they know to\
  \ search for their destinies ended up either on shanty outskirts or perhaps, a better\
  \ place.  \nThe opportunity I had received to better my life is one I am forever\
  \ gleeful for. Even though the Mother City is a daring place for a small town lover,\
  \ it presents itself as a stage where only dedication thrives.  The motivation to\
  \ finally penetrate the world of providing for people\u2019s mind becomes even stronger."
