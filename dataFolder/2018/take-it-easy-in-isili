Text: "My day in Isili was almost over and I was sitting outside my Italian friend`s\
  \ house with the feeling of gratitude for the most adorable day I had ever had while\
  \ travelling. It was a warm night with clear sky\u2013the one you will never have\
  \ in my home town in Russia in the middle of October. That was beyond words. My\
  \ trip surpassed the expectations. Sardinia showed what it has apart from beaches\
  \ in promoted destinations. So what does Isili taste like?\nIsili is a small town\
  \ in the southern Sardinia, hidden in the middle of nowhere, with just around 2,5\
  \ thsd people and almost no tourists. So, I was completely off the beaten track.\n\
  It happend thanks to Stefano, an Italian, oh I am sorry, Sardinian guy (we all know\
  \ how Italians stress the exact region they are from) who I met at Couchsurfing.\
  \ He impressively presented his home town and kindly invited me to visit it. Keeping\
  \ to the south I was very anxious to explore the island and meet locals.\nHaving\
  \ started the day with a cup of cappuccino with brioche (as a true Italian) I arrived\
  \ in Isili in the afternoon. Stefano made me feel like home immediately.\nThe best\
  \ connection among people who just met can be established by having a meal together.\
  \ I trust it but Italians do all too well. I was offered some pasta and homemade\
  \ wine. No help was accepted\u2013Stefano cooked with consummate skill on his own.\
  \ We talked a lot trying to insert every Italian or Russian word each of us knew.\
  \ I was so inspired and anxious about the day in Isili.\nAdmittedly, Isili occurred\
  \ to be a very small town\u2013it seemed like Stefano felt very proud of hosting\
  \ me, so I was pleased as well. We were walking through narrow streets with small,\
  \ one- or two-storey, colorful houses. Just a 20-minute walk and the town was over\
  \ but with a gift of a breathtaking view to the mountains and valleys. Moreover,\
  \ Isili shared with me its largest treasure\u2013The nuraghe Is Paras. There are\
  \ many nuraghes in Sardinia but this one is the highest and best preserved one.\n\
  Stefano continued to show the best around Isili\u2013Gennargentu National park with\
  \ wiild horses situated on the Giara's Gesturi plateau at 550m height. I always\
  \ saw horses as an attraction in a big city but never did ones out in the wild.\
  \ I was riding a bike enjoying the view, weather and my company thinking how big,\
  \ diversified, and wonderful our world is.\nI could not have imagined the richer\
  \ experience of tasting an unknown town, its spirit and identity. Isili called to\
  \ take everything easily and open mind."
