Text: "While pursuing my undergraduate degree in engineering, I fell for someone that\
  \ I truly believed was my one and only soulmate. SPOILER ALERT: he wasn\u2019t.\
  \ Things didn\u2019t work out and subsequently, I spent my last year of school trying\
  \ desperately to be okay on my own.\nThat\u2019s when the idea came to me \u2013\
  \ when I graduate, I should spend my savings on a trip to Europe. I\u2019m young,\
  \ I\u2019m single, I should be able to bounce back from this financial recklessness,\
  \ right?\nAt this point of my post-breakup phase, I was very pessimistic about love.\
  \ To me, love was a conscious decision to give someone else power over your happiness.\
  \ Soulmates don\u2019t exist. I needed to connect with me or I would inevitably\
  \ get lost in another. I planned the trip solo, but later had a friend come on board.\
  \ The fact that I was willing to spend 2 months in Europe alone is a testimony to\
  \ how devoid of human connection I was. \nThe first stop in Europe was Ireland.\
  \ I had a Gaelic girlfriend from my internship helping us get settled in. I didn\u2019\
  t know what to expect from Ireland, but when I saw a gay pride flag waving next\
  \ to the Irish flag, I felt at ease. I cannot speak for all African Americans, but\
  \ for me personally, there\u2019s always a bit of fear in the back of your mind\
  \ that you will not be well received by fair-skinned brethren. People who support\
  \ LGBTQ rights tend to support diversity and this vanquished any fear of being a\
  \ black sheep in Ireland.\nThat was my first realization regarding the importance\
  \ of human connection. Ireland is a gorgeous country but it\u2019s the people that\
  \ make the land more than just a beauty mark on the face of the earth. \nThen came\
  \ the night I will never forget. Outside an Irish pub, tipsy and gay, I found a\
  \ soulmate (who was also tipsy. And gay). There was no kiss in the rain. No love\
  \ at first sight. Instead, it was just me and a GBF (gay best friend), sharing cigarettes\
  \ and experiences, good and bad, that made us who we are. We talked the entire night,\
  \ every conversation filled with candid content. Things I hadn\u2019t even admitted\
  \ to myself yet. Things I never imagined I would share with another human. That\u2019\
  s when I realized what a real soulmate is. I completely opened up to someone and\
  \ he fully accepted and loved me even though we just met. A soulmate doesn\u2019\
  t have to be a lover. In fact, I think it\u2019s far more intimate that way. Now\
  \ I know the real definition of soulmates: people destined to meet along their journey\
  \ to help each other grow into the best version of themselves."
