Text: "Like many a wild night, mine kicked off with meeting a musician. In my head,\
  \ he will always look like Jimi Hendrix. He chain-smoked as we gabbed about topics\
  \ reserved for when you\u2019re inexplicably trying to impress someone. I was alone\
  \ without a plan in Victoria Falls, and had something inexplicable to prove.\n\n\
  The hostel soundtrack increased in volume; a sign to migrate where conversation\
  \ could continue without shouting. I agreed to come back to his house for dinner.\
  \ We loaded up on red wine and cornmeal at the supermarket, before driving until\
  \ familiar sights peeled away and the road got bumpy.\n\nOne by one, buildings disappeared.\
  \ Streetlights vanished via the rear view mirror. Tarmac became a single lane of\
  \ dust and dirt.\n\nFew encounters as a solo female traveller made me question my\
  \ ability to get out alive. But in that little yellow car on that dusty road, I\
  \ was scared of turning up on the news to murmurs of, \u201CSilly girl \u2013 she\
  \ should have known better.\u201D Scared I didn\u2019t have anything resembling\
  \ a weapon in my bag. Scared of Jimi\u2019s basement filled with rusty medical tools,\
  \ where he trusses up besotted backpackers and sings Foxy Lady before he kills them.\n\
  \nFear tugged at my clothes and whimpered right up until Jimi\u2019s front door.\
  \ I was shown in to the kitchen, where he handed me a glass of wine. I watched as\
  \ he rolled a joint and hummed along with the placating cadence of Bob Marley, stirring\
  \ a pot on the stove. His every movement spoke a language of effortless cool, and\
  \ my inner dork faltered in its presence.\n\nAbetted by wine and weed, the tone\
  \ of discussion shifted dramatically. Jimi moved close enough that I had to tilt\
  \ my head to look at him. What I glimpsed in his eyes unnerved me\u2026and I suddenly\
  \ didn\u2019t want to know where this was heading.\n\nI never found out, because\
  \ his hand swept sideways and collided with my wine glass. The amount of blood that\
  \ sprayed outwards was truly alarming. All air of cool abandoned, Jimi ordered me\
  \ about his house so I could patch up his deep, angry pink gash, and remove blood\
  \ and glass from just about every conceivable surface. With his hand out of action,\
  \ I took over cooking dinner.\n\nWe ate in total silence, ambiance irrevocably tainted.\
  \ Jimi looked sorry for himself. I sheepishly requested I be taken back to my hostel.\
  \ Awkward goodbyes were exchanged \u2013 contact details were not \u2013 and Jimi\
  \ (or whatever his name was) simply drove away. That was that. No rusty medical\
  \ tools. No chorus of Foxy Lady.\n\nNot exactly a rockstar exit."
