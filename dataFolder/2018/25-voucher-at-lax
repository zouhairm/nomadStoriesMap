Text: "It was a pub and in the end it was an easy choice. I was marooned in a hotel\
  \ I hadn't booked, in a country I should've left hours ago. When your flight's cancelled,\
  \ if you're lucky, you get a hotel room and a voucher. Except that my voucher was\
  \ $25 which, in a hotel like this, won't buy you much more than a pint and a sandwich.\
  \ Which is exactly what I wanted. The hotel had 4 restaurants. The first one was\
  \ a mock-up, like a grocery shop where you buy food and then eat it elsewhere. Vegan\
  \ this and gluten free that. Then there was one with no tablecloth and orange cutlery\
  \ and I knew instantly that my $25 voucher wouldn't be good enough for a glass of\
  \ water. There was a sushi place, which was too expensive, and then the pub. It\
  \ was the cheapest. And it had beers and sandwiches. And a 6'1 blonde girl standing\
  \ in it. She looked like she hadn't planned to be there. Like she had plans to be\
  \ elsewhere but no real urge. She looked like she had looked at all options; the\
  \ sushi place, the orange cutlery, the mock-up, and chose the pub. An easy choice.\
  \ She asked for a menu, and asked about today's special, and then she sat down on\
  \ a sofa and picked up a menu. I knew what was on the menu, because I could read,\
  \ and I knew what today's special was, because I'd listened, but I asked either\
  \ way.\n\"Can we afford today's special?\" \nI made a point of looking at my $25\
  \ voucher, like I wasn't even sure what it was. \n\"We can't afford anything\" she\
  \ said, \"not with $25 in this hotel.\"\nI smiled to myself.\n\"I'm just gonna have\
  \ the second cheapest sandwich they have. And the second cheapest beer.\"\nShe looked\
  \ puzzled. And curious.\n\"Second cheapest?\"\nI nodded. \"Rule of thumb\" I said,\
  \ \"second cheapest is usually best.\"\nShe nodded. Then she asked \"do you want\
  \ to sit down?\"\nI nodded. Smiled. Sat down beside her. She was incredibly tall.\
  \ It was obvious even though she was sitting down. She looked like a model, but\
  \ not quite. Harder, tougher. Like she woke up every day of her life and fought\
  \ crocodiles in the water and then ran marathons before climbing up mountains. A\
  \ body like a nuclear powerhouse, a brain like a calculator. Always burning energy.\
  \ \n\"Let's go\" I said \"we can eat later.\"\nI grabbed her hand and walked across\
  \ the room and past the lobby. And then we were outside in the warm air of Los Angeles\
  \ at night. I pointed at the LAX sign, just a few hundred yards away. \n\"So?\"\
  \ She asked \"What now?\" \n\"Doesn't matter. We have nothing to do. And all the\
  \ time in the world to do it.\""
