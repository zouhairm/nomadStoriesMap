Text: "\u2026 has more to show than tango. The buses of Buenos Aires definitely aren\u2019\
  t a part of this rhythm. There are no schedules just traffic jams, closed streets\
  \ and tourists, like me on that cloudy warm day of autumn, asking if the bus would\
  \ bring them to the right place. My friends were waiting for me because I was supposed\
  \ to bring the dessert for the asado, a barbeque. But first I had things to do in\
  \ the city. The first bus made me get off on the next station, because it wouldn\u2019\
  t even bring me close to my first destiny: \u201Cfacultad de medicina\u201D. I had\
  \ chosen the right number, the red \u201C60\u201D buses belonged to my favorites,\
  \ but they had very different routes. When I got in the next one, feeling a little\
  \ lost, the driver and the man in the first row started smiling at me and promised\
  \ to advise me when we arrive. Since the man in the first row with his long scraggy\
  \ grey hair had a lot of instruments I decided to sit in the second row. The bus\
  \ went on and both guys went on singing and laughing and chewing coca leaves. When\
  \ they noticed I turned around all the time to see if we had arrived, they invited\
  \ me to sit with them. It didn\u2019t take long until I held a charango in my hands\
  \ strumming one and the same chord in a very easy rhythm. They told me this stringed\
  \ instrument was inspired by the guitars and earlier built with the bodies of armadillos.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t even play the guitar and the charango has twelve strings, but\
  \ it didn\u2019t matter because Jos\xE9 played the flute so beautifully. \u201C\
  Ya pasen la gorra\u201D, the driver motivated us to pass the hat around, like my\
  \ new friend normally did to earn his livelihood. We just wanted to play. After\
  \ almost two hours which passed like a second I had to get off. Jos\xE9 decided\
  \ to help me. I was really late and only knew the name of the street I wanted to\
  \ go. So first of all we sat down at the stairs of the university and I tried to\
  \ show him the only song I knew on guitar until we were attacked by a giant grasshopper.\
  \ Jos\xE9, who already was my hero of the day, saved me, but the bug took us back\
  \ to reality so we went on. We sang and we laughed all the way until we gave up\
  \ and I really had to go home. I bought a pen to write down my number just in case\
  \ he had the chance to call me, but it was quite obvious we wouldn\u2019t hear from\
  \ each other anymore. Anyway we shared a great moment together and at this moment\
  \ I felt really poor because I couldn\u2019t return anything for the happiness and\
  \ wisdom he gave me. But there was confidence and an open ear."
