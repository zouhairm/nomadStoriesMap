Text: "A gunshot pierces the silence, jolting me back to reality, until she loses\
  \ me in her story once again. She lacks size and stature, but exudes extraordinary\
  \ passion. Her voice is quiet and collected, but strong and knowing. This is Hana.\
  \ \n\nHer words are the catalyst for my imagination, transforming the brittle dirt\
  \ below my feet to thick mud, and filling my quiet surroundings with the screams\
  \ of an almost forgotten time. \n\nWe are walking through a forest, about two hours\
  \ from the centre of Ho Chi Minh city, Vietnam. Trees and shrubs overhang the path,\
  \ casting dark shadows at the base of our feet. Some traces of history still linger,\
  \ from the famous Cu Chi tunnels to the rusted war tanks I keep seeing. Each has\
  \ their own story to tell and I learn more as the winding path leads us deeper and\
  \ deeper into the undergrowth.\n\nAfter rounding another corner of the trail a picket\
  \ fence comes into view. Hana holds up a hand, motioning for me to stop. Her eyes\
  \ narrow. \n\u201CWatch,\u201D she says, before picking up a stick and poking the\
  \ pile of leaves within the fence. The ground appears to flip, revealing a pit of\
  \ blood stained spikes. \n\n\u201CThis for Americans,\u201D she says with a grimace.\
  \ We walk on.\n\nI ask Hana several questions about the area as I try to understand\
  \ specific aspects of its history. She answers my questions with ease, until I ask\
  \ about her own family\u2019s involvement in the war. Then she pauses and considers\
  \ her words carefully. \n\n\u201CMany of my family were in the war,\u201D she says,\
  \ \u201Cand Agent Orange still haunts our lives to this day.\u201D\n\nI screw my\
  \ eyes shut. Agent Orange. The defoliant chemical sprayed over Vietnam during the\
  \ war, which affected over four million people. The chemicals ability to morph genes\
  \ meant that newborn babies many generations later were born horribly deformed and\
  \ disfigured.\n\nAnother gunshot, closer this time. We are approaching the shooting\
  \ range now. Hana tells me that the tour is coming to a close and asks if I have\
  \ any further questions. I tell her no, and she reaches out to shake hands. As she\
  \ retracts her hand I notice a small, partially formed sixth finger. \n\nI walk\
  \ away, stunned. Maybe I was wrong to question her on such a personal level, but\
  \ my close friendships were never formed from small talk. People say that history\
  \ shapes who you are, but until today I never considered the overwhelming injustice\
  \ of that."
