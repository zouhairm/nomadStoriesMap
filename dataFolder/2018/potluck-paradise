Text: "Wanting dirt & adventure I found Tony's sailboat off San Blas, Panama: Encouraged\
  \ by this swarthy sailor's offer to explore unknown waters, I sold the idea to my\
  \ parents, who I would be holidaying with, on its promised interaction with Guna\
  \ Indians. Snags arose when they invited friends Ken & Jo to join us also: All appeared\
  \ ready & able so I locked-in this exciting departure from hotels.\nWe arrived by\
  \ air and from the sea-ruffled crowd stepped Tony. He ferried us to his boat via\
  \ dinghy; a precarious act of balancing bums & baggage, then climbing aboard from\
  \ the water with no ladder: 'Lost' by other guests, he explained.\nWe soon met Ishmael,\
  \ our first local. The farmer invited us to trek to a waterfall. The terrain grew\
  \ steeper, intersecting creeks & Jo wanted to clarify how much further it was. Ishmael\u2019\
  s response \u2018Not far\u2019 didn't convince her or Ken. Much later, we found\
  \ them back at the farm; Jo under a palm and Ken in a wheel barrow. Admiring the\
  \ spectacle it was hard to read Ken\u2019s sobriety with mischief still tugging\
  \ at his eyes; but the pair were dragging anchor.\nFrom all they'd seen with missing\
  \ ladders & cramped bunks there was no denying they felt trapped. Making matters\
  \ worse Jo was sick and hushed tones gave-way to active escape plans. Flying in\
  \ we'd noted a resort: Some frontier luxury. Could Tony give passage to this terra\
  \ firma? Below deck, 'regressing' into my narrow bunk, I succumbed to lapping water;\
  \ leaving the adults to discuss options. Reality set in: We had to set sail. Jo\
  \ hoped to hell her ginger tablets would do the trick.\nAnd Tony\u2019s promise\
  \ to explore unknown waters? Code for him also being unfamiliar with the island\
  \ chain, depositing us for long hours: on Potluck Paradises: Standing around on\
  \ beachless slices of heaven doesn\u2019t do a body any good, so you pass much time\
  \ scouring driftwood furnishings for the love of someplace to sit!\nLastly, and\
  \ furthest from our minds, came the outstanding monies in addition to our 'deposit'.\
  \ I faintly recalled details but hadn't kept records. Ken argued it was unreasonable,\
  \ the boat so poorly neglected. Unyielding, Tony located an email showing agreements,\
  \ but with little remaining cash the compromise was to later transfer the remainder\
  \ via Western Union.\nThe final resting place of our thoughts was on debt: A regret\
  \ to remedy before being able to enjoy memories of lovely moments. Despite this\
  \ I would venture again into unknown waters in a Caribbean heartbeat! ...Just better\
  \ bookkeeping next time!"
