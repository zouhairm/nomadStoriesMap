Text: "When a beautiful Portuguese woman you fancy invites you to spend six weeks\
  \ with her at her family\u2019s estate, you don\u2019t hesitate.  Not if you are\
  \ young and unattached, as I then was.  That was many years ago, when Salazar was\
  \ Portugal\u2019s dictator.\n\nThe estate, the Quinta do Robalo, was in a resort\
  \ area overlooking the beach town of Vila Nova de Caparica, just across the Tagus\
  \ River from Lisbon.  It was grand and exotic, with 50 acres of terraced gardens.\
  \  My friend Katarina\u2019s father was very eccentric.  Katarina\u2019s mother\
  \ had been his eighth wife.  He was an ardent smoker, often smoking two cigarettes\
  \ at once.  He kept a brand new 1939 Alvis in the garage.  \u201CCouldn\u2019t get\
  \ parts after the war started, so I just left it there,\u201D he told me.  The main\
  \ house sported a great white hunter\u2019s lifetime of trophies, lions, cape buffalo,\
  \ kudus, etc.  The piano Liszt had brought to Portugal was in the salon; it sounded\
  \ terrible when I plonked the keys.  I found a Degas pastel in a corner, its cracked\
  \ glass held together with sticky tape.   \n\nFor 48 years, I treasured those memories,\
  \ but nothing lasts.  A career and a yen for new places kept me from returning,\
  \ but I knew that I would go back one day.  That day came when Sir David and Lady\
  \ Linda invited my wife and I to meet them in Porto for a few days.\n\nWe flew to\
  \ Lisbon and set off by car for the Quinta do Robalo.  All we had was a 48-year\
  \ old crude hand-drawn map showing its location.  I didn\u2019t recognize anything.\
  \  We got near it, but the estate seemed to have vanished.  We spent an abortive\
  \ hour making wrong turns and ineffectual inquiries to local residents.  I was ready\
  \ to give up \u2013 we\u2019d probably see little more than the quinta\u2019s gate\
  \ if we found it \u2013 but my wife said \u201Clet\u2019s go back to that dirt road\
  \ and go down it a little further.\u201D  \n\nBingo.  We saw a distinctive fa\xE7\
  ade of the Quinta do Robalo in the distance, but couldn\u2019t find the gate.  Some\
  \ locals were passing the afternoon chatting by their cars.  We asked them for directions.\
  \  We took one\u2019s response for \u201Cfollow me.\u201D  He drove off, we followed\
  \ him, and in two minutes we were at the Quinta do Robalo.  Then came the last thing\
  \ I expected.\n\nIt was an abandoned, utter ruin.  We wandered for hours wondering\
  \ how anyone could allow the marble balustrades to topple, weeds to grow in the\
  \ empty swimming pool, and brilliant bougainvillea to grow through the salon in\
  \ which Liszt\u2019s piano once had been, emerging through the roof.  The 1939 Alvis\
  \ was gone."
