Text: "It was the pleasant month of September up north but as I walked out of Anna\
  \ International Airport in Chennai, a gush of sultry wind brushed my face. With\
  \ a terrible mix of Tamil and English, I boarded an autorickshaw that played some\
  \ folk music on the radio, or that is what I could make by the tune of it. It took\
  \ me over 40 minutes to reach Thiruvanmiyur bus station, from where I was to catch\
  \ a bus for my long-pending Pondicherry trip. \n\nThe road from Chennai to Pondicherry\
  \ was canopied with trees, the view of Bay of Bengal running all along on my left\
  \ side, Annas adorned white lungis, and mostly chequered shirts and the women on\
  \ the bus wore colourful silk sarees. I barely knew about the place and was always\
  \ sceptical as to how it would turn out. Well, it surpassed my expectations and\
  \ left me speechless. This quaint little town was a careful blend of history, culture\
  \ and art. Famous for its French quarters, the colourful buildings stood along the\
  \ coastline gazing at the promenade beach. Already a little impressed with the vibrant\
  \ charm, and the planned streets, I found out that based on planning from the French\
  \ period, the city had been divided into the French quarter--Villa Blanche and Tamil\
  \ quarter--Villa Noire. The city where life is not rushing, a getaway from everyday\
  \ hustle, a gentle reminder to slow down in life and move with the flow, a city\
  \ like this gives life its own perks. I woke up to chirping birds that morning,\
  \ staring at deep coloured architectural buildings from the balcony of my rented\
  \ room and tantalising sweet smell of flowers that wafted in the breeze made me\
  \ want to go for a detour trip to Auroville village. \nWandering on the streets\
  \ was an extreme charm as I tried to contain my happiness that I finally made it\
  \ to this town after days of planning. Till date, several streets retain the \u2018\
  Rue\u2019 (french for street), there are still villas in French architectural style\
  \ on one side, and thinnai-fronted houses in the Tamil side. It was this co-existence\
  \ and confluence of French and Tamil heritage which made the place irresistible\
  \ and unique. If you are a peace-lover, not seeking to hurry up your travel, I highly\
  \ recommend hiring a bicycle. Cycling in clean, broad roads of White town gave me\
  \ a perspective to witness things in a new way. While cycling my way through, I\
  \ could see this town was home to age-old French legacy, precariously maintained\
  \ in today\u2019s modern ways.  With each pedal, each second, I was falling in love\
  \ with an emotion that is Pondy."
