Text: "Sea Turtle Camp wasn\u2019t exactly as I\u2019d pictured it. There were no\
  \ walls, and the ceiling was comprised of tin sheets strung together. I gingerly\
  \ tied my mosquito net around a top bunk on the end, claiming it as mine. The camp\
  \ assistant was a harsh girl whose humor had either been lost from her for years,\
  \ or never existed. From her demeanor you would think that campers were being punished\
  \ for a life of violent crime, and not a ragtag group of travelers. But our fellow\
  \ travelers more than made up for the severity of our overlord, and I was shocked\
  \ that people from so many different corners of the world had somehow found this\
  \ remote piece of sand, and these feeble boards, and were staking out bunks.Food\
  \ was served in metal bowls that were routinely scraped, refilled, licked by cows,\
  \ and then ready for re-use. We were quite used to meals consisting of rice and\
  \ beans. Turtle camp would be no different, but now the rice was accompanied by\
  \ small rocks. At turtle camp you sleep and rise as the sun does. But in the twilight\
  \ you tell stories of your home country and make friendship bracelets out of coconut\
  \ strings. By night we took watch over the turtle hatchery inspecting the nests\
  \ for babies. The baby turtles were fragile and precious and so delicate I felt\
  \ wicked for imagining these small creatures could battle the waves. In the morning\
  \ we went straight to work so we could finish before the heat of the day set in.\
  \ Most of the daytime work involved moving sand. Sand is heavy. Empty turtle nests\
  \ were dug out and replaced with fresh clean sand from the water\u2019s edge. We\
  \ used old rice sacks which we would fill with sand, dump, and repeat. A world without\
  \ electricity is a very different one. We wove together tree palms, wore clothes\
  \ we found washed up on the beach, and tried balancing on ribbons tied to trees.\
  \ One afternoon the guys returned from a trip to pump water with their heads down.\
  \ In hushed tones we were informed that a dead raccoon was found in our drinking\
  \ water. With our clean drinking water compromised morale was low. I had rationed\
  \ a few more Gatorades for the next few days, but that was hardly anything to be\
  \ overjoyed about. We all decided to descend into a different level of hygiene and\
  \ to only bath ourselves in the sea. Every aspect of turtle camp put me in a new\
  \ untested scenario and pushed me tremendously."
