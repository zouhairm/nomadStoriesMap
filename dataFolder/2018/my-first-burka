Text: "Mirroring the waters of the Bosporus Strait, the wild and rushing river of\
  \ people flowed from unknown starts and branched into terminals; bottlenecking and\
  \ bathroom-breaking throughout the long hallways of Istanbul\u2019s Ataturk airport.\
  \ The city\u2019s legacy was not lost on me as I awaited my next flight on an island\
  \ of chairs and observed the stream of travelers; culture clashing, clamoring citizen\
  \ ambassadors from all corners of the world.\n\nMoving toward me, together and walking\
  \ in rhythm, were five women in full burka and one man, in blue shorts, t-shirt,\
  \ and sandals. Unlike my clothes, which felt glued to my body after 19 hours of\
  \ flying, the burkas moved like windsocks around the women\u2019s hips, knees, and\
  \ ankles in the rush of steps down the international terminal. There were five 'windsocks',\
  \ each a different shade of blue; from the blue-white of a fluorescent bulb to a\
  \ deep, dark navy.\n\nI had spent years travelling, studying cultures and teaching\
  \ tolerance but all of that understanding escaped me with this first encounter of\
  \ women in burka. My unthinking self was triggered, especially by the juxtaposition\
  \ of such a casually dressed man in their company. This cerulean battle between\
  \ beachwear and burkas made my blood boil with what I saw as great injustice. My\
  \ mind was taken over by a frenetic firing of assumptions, fears, and biases that\
  \ each seized my nervous system; shortening my breath, tightening my muscles, scrambling\
  \ my mind. \n\nSo, I began to ask questions.\n\nWho was this man to this covered,\
  \ flowing, band of blue women? Where were they going? Where were they from? How\
  \ were they all connected? \nImmediately, my muscles relaxed, my breath slowed,\
  \ and my torso leaned forward, as if my whole body wanted to know more. It was this\
  \ method of detached curiosity that later let me enjoy a balcony in Izmir at the\
  \ edge of a thundering storm. The air thick and still with impending rain and electricity,\
  \ with the call to prayer cutting though from a nearby mosque. It\u2019s how I could\
  \ sit in a holy space in Istanbul so close to the synchronized spin of faithful\
  \ dervishes that I could feel the breeze from their whirling garments on my face.\
  \ \n\nWhere the news, politicians, and one-sided stories fill our subconscious minds\
  \ with what we should be afraid of, curiosity moves us from what we think we know\
  \ to discovering what we don\u2019t. And in an airport terminal of the city built\
  \ on bridging multiple worlds, my own demons were revealed and bested by a series\
  \ of simple questions."
