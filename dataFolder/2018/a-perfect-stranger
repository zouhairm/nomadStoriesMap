Text: "Just buy tickets and come cause I never know whether you will see me in this\
  \ country tomorrow, said my close friend who works in CERN, that huge collider beast\
  \ hidden underground within the boundaries of several European countries.  And well,\
  \ I am quick to pack and here I am landing already in Gen\xE8ve airport. I was curious\
  \ about this expensive country and something pushed me to find out what makes Swiss\
  \ banks so solid, Swiss chocolate so popular and Swiss watches so precise.  You\
  \ can smell the difference even in the air-everything is so blooming and looks luxury.\
  \ People dress very handsome. Even how they walk says that they feel on top. Even\
  \ lake swans are extremely white and look very happy. And Swiss francs-they are\
  \ so colorful that you just do not want to pay with them but just keep for yourself.\
  \ I walk further along Gen\xE8ve lake and watching the Chinese Mont Blanc-why Chinese,\
  \ you say. Because local friends explain me that you do not see the real mountain\
  \ all the time-it is hiding behind the clouds but for cameras of Chinese people-it\
  \ is right there. Lake has 50 shades of blue, I think and definitely only one white\
  \ color-of those multiple yachts and sailing-vessels slowly cutting through the\
  \ light rise of water. Taking my time I fall under the shadow of Botanical garden\
  \ trees overlooking the lake. I feel somebody observing and following me for some\
  \ time already and I make my steps quicker. And suddenly stranger appears just before\
  \ me and with his hand gesture makes me look above my head-somebody hiding up in\
  \ the trees-a carrot bushy tail. I laugh and thousands of French words are muttered\
  \ into the air. But well, I just speak English. But the stranger is so enthusiastic\
  \ and energetic that he wants to tell me everything and among those utterances I\
  \ catch the main meanings. The feeling of loneliness disappears and you just dive\
  \ in the pleasant atmosphere of your new friend. And you come to the conclusion\
  \ that among all that luxury and status, people feel very alone and they just need\
  \ such a stranger, a human at their side to share hidden emotions and feel alive.\
  \ We are all sometimes like animals in the zoo hiding deep inside our carapaces\
  \ but even here there is a big difference- animals are put there involuntarily and\
  \ we, people, hide on purpose. Sometimes it is worthy to give a hand to a stranger\
  \ and follow the unknown route-who knows what is looking for you ahead? Just step\
  \ in in this adventure and feel alive."
