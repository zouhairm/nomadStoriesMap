Text: "It\u2019s 4 am in Quito, as we start our trip through the Andes to the Pacific\
  \ cost.\nAnother trip, among curves, changes of altitude and ear pressures. It is\
  \ past 10 am and I\u2019m going to check my cellphone. But IT\u2019S NOT THERE!\
  \ My new indigenous Colombian bag, disappeared! I don\u2019t have my cellphone,\
  \ wallet, pocket money, nor any sort of girly stuff. F* word - and tons of tears.\
  \ I check again the bag and my analog camera is still there. It survived that evil\
  \ attack. A couple of hours more to arrive to our destination: Pedernales.\nThe\
  \ bus stops on a field, with clay ground, a lot of people and many tents selling\
  \ food. We take a moto-taxi to the center, to find some hostels. It\u2019s hot like\
  \ hell, and we are wearing our winter clothes. At Quito it\u2019s cold.\nThis is\
  \ a strange town. We don\u2019t quite understand what happened here: clay roads,\
  \ all buildings are in construction. It is a town made of scaffolds and bricks,\
  \ you can\u2019t find a church - which is very strange even to the smallest village\
  \ in South America! Hostels are too expensive or don\u2019t exist at all. We ask\
  \ a local and he says that the hostel fell down! Then we remember: it was the earthquake\
  \ that happened in April\u201916! The epicenter was here, with a 7,8 richter scale.\
  \ Now everything makes sense.\n It\u2019s getting hotter, and the backpacks feel\
  \ heavier. We find a bench with a shade. On our left side we gaze at the Pacific\
  \ Ocean for the first time. On the right side we take a glimpse at a seafood restaurant:\
  \ our stomachs growl, we are almost without money due to the evil person from the\
  \ bus.\n On the restaurant we ask for one meal to share. And when the waitress came\
  \ with the tray she says: \u201Can extra dose\u201D with a blink. That was the best\
  \ seafood rice ever.\n At the end of our meal we ask to the owner if he knows some\
  \ cheap place or camping to stay overnight. Without hesitation he invited us to\
  \ stay at their place with them. The grandmother and the wife are the cooks, the\
  \ daughter is the waitress. At home - which is only one room made of wood at the\
  \ 1st floor - live the mother, father and the little one year old Jos\xE9. They\
  \ live there since the earthquake, when they lost everything. They restarted their\
  \ lives, armed only with a mattress and backpacks full of, mostly baby, clothes.\n\
  \ They welcomed us with open arms. They shared their home, their stories, their\
  \ family and meals with us. We lived two days eating fresh seafood and as in a family\
  \ we didn\u2019t pay a cent.\n Thank you, evil thief."
