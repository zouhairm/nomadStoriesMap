Text: "The Cannes Film Festival takes place annually in the south of France for 12\
  \ days in May. One of the largest of its kind in Europe, its location is also a\
  \ renowned holiday hotspot for the rich. Last year I decided to take advantage of\
  \ my status as a student in Cinema Studies to apply for accreditation, totally aware\
  \ that I could not afford to travel with my meagre undergraduate allowance, not\
  \ to mention pay the rental of minimum 50 euros per night for a bed in the city\
  \ (my bad, I only checked the prices a week before the start of the festival, as\
  \ compared to my essays, which I only finish the day before the deadline).\nThere\
  \ were of course cheaper housing options such as camping at the outskirts of the\
  \ city for 30 euros per night but I could not find a companion in time. On the train\
  \ to Cannes, just as I was alighting, I struck up a conversation with an old lady.\
  \ It turned out that she is a long-term employee at a rather renowned distributing\
  \ company. She told me that she was a frequent festival attendee, that she would\
  \ be staying with her friends and that she would be leaving for Monaco on the twenty-first.\
  \ I hesitated whether to ask her if she could spare me a bed for the night(s) and\
  \ when I finally worked up the courage, she was gone. \nI ended up staying at a\
  \ hostel in Nice for less than 20 euros a night and spent a nauseating 2 hours to\
  \ travel from Nice to Cannes each morning for 3,50 euros, repeating the painful\
  \ routine in the evening. And just in case you are wondering, I did try other ways.\
  \ \nFor one I tried to take the train without having to pay the 7 euros fee. One\
  \ night I saw the inspector board the train and in a hurry to escape, forgot that\
  \ it was the last train. Determined not to take a cab (plus the area is not covered\
  \ by Uber), I decided to walk home. It took a long time before I was stopped by\
  \ the police; I was on a highway with some roadworks on the side and the road workers\
  \ spotted me and called the police. The police officers were kind to not write me\
  \ a fine but less so when they did not give me a ride home, explaining that they\
  \ would be travelling out of their jurisdiction and would thus not be covered by\
  \ their insurance. They called a cab for me and I paid 50 euros for the ride. \n\
  Oh and yes, the festival. I never thought that people would actually stand the whole\
  \ day in the sweltering heat just for a few shots of the celebrities on the red\
  \ carpet and on the rare occasions, an autograph. But I guess everyone is crazy\
  \ in their own way."
