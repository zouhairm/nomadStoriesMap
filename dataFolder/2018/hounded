Text: "\u201CJolene! What were you in for this time?\u201D We are interrupted by the\
  \ arrival of an older woman, grey hair disheveled as she swaggers into the bus station.\n\
  She claws at her face with a gnarled hand. \u201CThis guy broke my thumbs so I beat\
  \ him with a piece of firewood.\u201D \n\nAfter six months travelling on Greyhound\
  \ buses through backwater American towns, nothing surprises you. Almost. \nAround\
  \ me, fluorescent lights reflect off tiled walls and tired lino floors, scuffed\
  \ by generations of restless feet. The passengers around me look bleak and bone-weary,\
  \ waiting for buses long overdue. We had been delayed in Dallas, Texas, for two\
  \ hours. When we were unexpectedly offloaded so that drug dogs could search the\
  \ carriage, no one was surprised. Juggling bags and baggage, we were all trying\
  \ to get home. \n\nCarrying 18 million passengers a year, Greyhound coaches are\
  \ a symbol of the American soul. More often than not, they are seedy, dangerous\
  \ and carry the stench of desperation. \"You'll get mugged!\" is the frequent cry\
  \ of well-meaning friends. \n\nThe young Hispanic man in front of me, Jesse, watches\
  \ my bags. \n\u201CWhere are you coming from?\u201D I ask when I return from the\
  \ restroom. He lowers his voice: \u201CPTX.\u201D \nLike any out-of-towner trying\
  \ to blend in with the locals, I respond with a nonchalant nod and pretend I know\
  \ what he means. I take in his flimsy grey clothes and brown paper bag, containing\
  \ a few meager possessions. The realization rolls in: he has just been released\
  \ from Texas Penitentiary: most likely Hutchins State Jail (I google it later).\
  \ \n\n\u201CLike my new jewelry?\u201D Jesse\u2019s cheeks crinkle upwards as he\
  \ points to his ankle monitor. As we sit on the bus, sweltering in a heat that soaks\
  \ through our shirts, we talk. Upon release from federal prison in the US, you are\
  \ given a one-way Greyhound ticket to wherever you call home - if you have one.\
  \ \n\nJesse has been away for 10 months. \u201CI used to be a really good boxer.\
  \ Look me up \u2013 you\u2019ll see!\u201D He scrawls his name on a napkin, thrusting\
  \ it at me to keep. Within eight years, almost half of released prisoners will be\
  \ back behind bars: this bus can be a gateway to freedom or a transfer back into\
  \ disrepute. \n\nAs we arrive in downtown Austin, I ask \u201CWhat comes next?\u201D\
  \ \n\"Starting over\u201D he pauses. \"Making amends.\" \n\nA disembodied voice\
  \ regurgitates departure times and hopeful optimism gives way to a glimpse of anxiety.\
  \ I farewell Jesse with a nod, staying on-board rather than watch my friend wait\
  \ for a family and a future that may not come."
