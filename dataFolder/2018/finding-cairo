Text: "I thought we were waiting for a gap in the traffic before we crossed the road.\
  \ Sure, as any half-baked clich\xE9 about Cairo will tell you, the traffic is wild.\
  \ However, a moment must come when there will be fewer cars going less fast than\
  \ the current stream of metal salmon on wheels that is careening down this Cairene\
  \ street.\n\nThat moment might have come, but Uncle Hatem was not going to wait.\
  \ Grabbing the three of us with his powerful hands, he concluded that it was an\
  \ absolute winner of an idea to yank us out in front a car and a bus. Both vehicles\
  \ were traveling at speeds that would leave most people thinking \u201Cgee they\
  \ are going quite quickly and I don\u2019t have a deathwish so no thanks I won\u2019\
  t cross the road just yet.\u201D\n\nWe got to the sidewalk with time to turn around\
  \ and see how fast the motor-salmon had been going, which I suppose is exactly enough\
  \ time. I thought I could smell smoke from my spinning legs but it was just the\
  \ stalls of roasting shaabi (of the people) sweetcorn wafting from Tahrir Square.\n\
  \nWalking into the sunset and down to the river, we got on a boat. Having stumbled\
  \ down awkwardly, I sheepishly watched the man carrying his bike, stacked with bread,\
  \ jump on board. In between parents and their children, he lumped two barrels of\
  \ milk onto the peeling, green boat.\n\nGezirat Al Dahab (Island of Gold) is a jarring\
  \ departure from the cityscape. It sits in the middle of the Nile, in the shadow\
  \ of El-Moneib bridge, surrounded by water and the concrete of Cairo. The island\
  \ has one shop and no cars but mud roads and donkeys carrying loads: the quietest\
  \ place in the loudest city. Stepping aside to allow carts to pass, a cool breeze\
  \ nudged us through claustrophobic paths, shallow valleys between clustered, minimal\
  \ storey homes. Previously prohibited from building upwards, the 2011 revolution\
  \ gave people the chance to expand their houses: nobody from the government came,\
  \ the people did it themselves.\n\nThe pathway opened up for us to stand at the\
  \ edge of endless green farmland, in the middle of Cairo. \n\nMy host insisted that\
  \ Cairo merely does a rendition of disorder. In the spaces where there should be\
  \ official rules, there is a clear, shared Cairene knowledge. Cars don\u2019t slow\
  \ down because they know we are sprinting across the road and people build their\
  \ own housing blocks because they know the government won\u2019t. \n\nBeneath the\
  \ disarray lies a system. Ten days in, I needed perfectly tilled farmland to realise."
