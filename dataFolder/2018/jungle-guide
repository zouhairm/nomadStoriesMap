Text: "A scream. A long harsh cry in the jungle. I can\u2019t be certain whose it\
  \ is. And Wellington won\u2019t tell me. From the first few seconds, he froze. All\
  \ at once, he stopped his quiet walk. (His soundless and falsely nonchalant walk).\
  \ I saw him recovering. His back contracted. He craned his neck, the face towards\
  \ the scream, as if he tried to hear better.  The cry echoed. And a calm smile came\
  \ on the lips of my guide. Not the smirk he always has when I speak. No. There,\
  \ it was a deep satisfaction smile. A hungry smile. Without a look at me, he left\
  \ the path we were quietly following, and embarked in the deep green on the left.\
  \ Tense, fast and noiseless. Thanks to his machete, he is moving through the jungle,\
  \ focused. I\u2019m now trying to follow, clumsy and noisy, stumbling, trying to\
  \ avoid the branches he moves away for him before letting them go on me. He pauses,\
  \ several times. He cranes his neck, always. Few seconds, sometimes more. And, hearing\
  \ a signal my ears can\u2019t detect, he adjusts his steering, and resumes his path,\
  \ still fast and silent, a hoping smile lighting his face. I\u2019m wondering. Which\
  \ animal is it ? Jaguar ? A thrill of excitement crosses my back. I am struggling\
  \ to follow Wellington who, without even running, avances with a great speed. Feline,\
  \ habile and silent. I\u2019m afraid he is losing us. He issolely focused on the\
  \ animal hunting, and seems to have forgotten us (the camp location and me). Still,\
  \ I try to eliminate the fear from my mind, and to trust him. He seems so certain,\
  \ of his moves, of his direction, of what he hears and sees. I only can trust him.\
  \ The jungle is his home, and here, he strongly looks like an animal tracking his\
  \ prey. We\u2019ve been walking for half and hour. The forest is very thick. Green\
  \ and brown everythere. Very few light reaches us. But where I only see vegetation\
  \ walls, Wellington finds his path, our path. His moving his machete, perhaps unconsciously,\
  \ only focused on the beast. He is making a new halt. This time, longer. I hear\
  \ a thousand sounds I cannot identify. He hears the only one he is waiting for.\
  \ This time, the cry is roar, very closed to us. I am tiggling : happiness. The\
  \ victory on your face, in your eyes, young guide,  tells me we are reaching our\
  \ goal. Beautiful victory on your face. And suddenly, I know. I know that I want\
  \ to stay here, with you. I want you to learn me every secret of the jungle. Every\
  \ secret you seem to know. Every secret I want to discover with you."
