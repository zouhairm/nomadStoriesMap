Text: "As a middle-aged man who has lived a life of excess. I mean everything I have\
  \ done, I did it to the extreme until there was nothing left, especially red wine.\
  \ I always wanted to escape to a yoga retreat, that somehow was connected to a wine\
  \ bar, yet for some reason,  I could never find one.\nFinding myself at 38, single,\
  \ burnt out and a body full of red wine. I decided this was a great time to live\
  \ out my dream of escaping to a land of Namastes. I didn't give too much thought\
  \ about it; The only specific factor was that the destination was Bali. \nI googled\
  \ Yoga retreats Bali. On the screen before me, popped up many locations, so  I went\
  \ with my intuition and clicked on Canggu Beach. Now I am a guy who looks for \"\
  signs\" and here at the top of Google search was a Singles Yoga Retreat,  a 30-day\
  \ yoga retreat in Canggu Bali and it was on sale. \n In under a week, I was on a\
  \ plane on my quest to become a Yogi.  \nAfter landing late the night before I woke\
  \ up on my first morning,  a little taken back by the scene before me. I swear I\
  \ had landed on the set of The Beach, with Leonardo ordering his takeaway Soy Latte\
  \ in front of me. Scattered around this Eco-friendly Yoga retreat, were pretty young\
  \ men and women from all over our vast globe, talking in their native tongue and\
  \ lounging on outdoor couches.\nI have never felt more miscast than ever. Checking\
  \ in for my first yoga, I can say the thought crossed my mind to run.\nNow in Yoga,\
  \ there is no judging, so once I let my ego stop talking my head off, I found myself\
  \ loving and being happy with my decision. My emotions turned into great happiness\
  \ when I discovered my tribe. People over 30, who were all traveling solo with a\
  \  burn out the story, similar to mine.\nI had found my cast of The Beach. I can\
  \ say my month spent in Bali was one of my happiest months in my 38 years. I did\
  \ downward dogs; I meditated, I made friends from all over the globe. I laughed\
  \ with these new friends, cried as well, ate fresh food cheaply, swam in the ocean.\
  \ I spoke to anyone and everyone, cause traveling solo you have too. I made friends\
  \ with the locals, and naturally, I fell in love with Bali. \nFor anyone thinking\
  \ of traveling alone, visiting Bali or taking up Yoga. Do it. These three pieces\
  \ of a recipe have changed my life. I'm not saying it will change yours, but if\
  \ I learned anything on this trip. Anything is possible. You just need to jump."
