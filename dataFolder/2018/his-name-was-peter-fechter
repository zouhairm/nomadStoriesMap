Text: "My plane landed after a long journey of flight delays and layovers. Too tired\
  \ for any kind of adventure my body told me, \u201C...rest first and tomorrow you\
  \ will explore\u201D. The next morning, I prepared myself for all that Berlin had\
  \ to offer and possibly more. \n\nWalking towards city center I was met with great\
  \ familiarity. Like any other large city the streets were bustling with tourists,\
  \ tour guides and the occasional red hop-on-hop-off bus that promises to take you\
  \ to see the city highlights. \u201CNot necessary\u201D I thought as I continued\
  \ to walk on my own. I like to travel by foot. \n\nWith no personal itinerary, I\
  \ took a dull right onto Zimmerstrasse and quickly noticed that the touristic streets\
  \ of Berlin began to anti-climatically fade into that of an abandoned alley. The\
  \ space became eerily quiet with the occasional person passing by. \u201CAm I not\
  \ supposed to be here?\u201D I thought to myself. But I kept walking. \n\nAcross\
  \ the street, I noticed a simple reddish-brown totem pole. It looked lonely, a feeling\
  \ I knew well. It\u2019s presence possessed a cryptic one that was difficult for\
  \ me to decipher from afar so I walked over to see what it was. \n\nStanding face-to-face\
  \ with the structure I immediately felt the world stood still. It was just me, this\
  \ structure and no one else. Inscribed on the cold surface were the words, \u201C\
  ...er wollte nur die Freiheit.\u201D which directly translates to \u201C...he just\
  \ wanted freedom\u201D. I then realized that this was a haunting reference to the\
  \ Cold War and right before me was the \u201CMemorial to Peter Fechter\u201D.\n\n\
  Peter Fechter (1944-1962), born during the Nazi Germany Era, was only one of the\
  \ thousands of individuals who attempted to escape East Berlin through the Berlin\
  \ Wall. But, his death was one of the most controversial deaths of its time.\n\n\
  Towards the end of the day I spent a generous amount of time researching his life.\
  \ I wanted to know who he was, why he died and what he did to deserve his demise.\
  \ The more I learned about his circumstances the more I began to feel for him. Filled\
  \ with a panel of emotions, I wished that I could have changed the course of history\
  \ where he actually survived. But history cannot be changed. \n\nDuring my remaining\
  \ days in the Berlin there was not one day where I did not visit his memorial in\
  \ hopes that others may also stop and acknowledge his existence the way I did. I\
  \ will never forget the day I discovered the young man who risked his life for chance\
  \ at freedom. His name was Peter Fechter."
