Text: "We crept to the ditch and stared. The hippopotamus, calf-deep in mud, stared\
  \ back across the 50m. We noticed a part of his back had been gouged out - likely\
  \ from when he had been chased out of his herd. Our guide casually leaned on his\
  \ rifle and reminded us not to get attached, an aging lone hippo is vulnerable and\
  \ \"predators lurk all 26,000 ha of Lake Mburo National Park\u201D.\n\nGoogle tells\
  \ you the park is four hours outside Kampala. We had driven almost six, and another\
  \ two to find a guide. By then, time had become quicksilver, laced with new experiences\
  \ - Aaliyah had ensured our journey involved admiring where the equator bisects\
  \ Uganda and tasting new meats from a roadside market.\n\nShe is nothing one might\
  \ expect of a targeted activist from a conservative country hostile to LGBTQs. She\
  \ led a team monitoring rights issues, had shared a stage with global luminaries,\
  \ and would in fact be taking a persecuted couple over the border the very next\
  \ day. But that day with us, all was normal. She bought shades, and modelled a silver-rimmed\
  \ pair together with a megawatt smile and Yankees cap for us. \n\nLater, Marco rode\
  \ shotgun, and we were stopped by police who had spotted his white face. The officer's\
  \ ask was subtle: \u201Cif I check the car, you know I\u2019d find something wrong.\u201D\
  \ Aaliyah tensed up before taking charge. \n\nAs we made our way further out though,\
  \ people were less likely to recognize her and she began to relax. First, she pointed\
  \ out her childhood school. Then she noted, with some heat, that grazing cattle\
  \ have replaced the wild animals - I tried not to show how impressed I was with\
  \ the cows\u2019 almost foot-long horns. Later, she talked of how her vehicle had\
  \ once stalled in the middle of cannibal land right where she had warned the tourists\
  \ about on their outbound trip. Her jokes were told with a low, gravelly voice -\
  \ it was easy to see the charisma that galvanized thousands to her cause.\n\nAaliyah\u2019\
  s guffaw brought me back to the ditch; her assistant waved from the car with a bottle\
  \ of Uganda\u2019s finest beer in each hand, even as the bull took a step forward.\
  \ While its fate was sealed, the he remained deadly, so we retreated for a long\
  \ ride back.\n\nAs the shadows grew long, Aaliyah sighed frequently that there was\
  \ no place quite as beautiful as Uganda. It is stunning; but her visions were more\
  \ resplendent than what our eyes could see because she saw a better, more humane\
  \ world. In the fading light, she whispered, \"even though I've been advised to\
  \ get out due to threats, I could never leave.\""
