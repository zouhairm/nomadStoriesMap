Text: "The way to the soul \n\n     The endeavor to walk the \xAB way saint James\
  \ \xBB started in March when I was thinking of new ways to travel. This project\
  \ involved minimization, a flexible mind, sharing a bedroom in a dormitory, and\
  \ walking endlessly at it first seemed! I really felt that if I could achieve that\
  \ walk I would gain a different sense of life fulfillment that would add strength\
  \ within myself, but what I didn't know is that it would bring way more that I would\
  \ expect...\n\n       Walking every day 20 to 30 km was an incredible feeling. A\
  \ friend told me you enter the Camino like a tourist and you end it like a pilgrim.\
  \ Indeed, there is a shift happening that you realize when you look back at your\
  \ experience.\nThe first few days come along with the excitement to enter the Camino\
  \ and meet new people, and I feel like we all still carry the vibrations of the\
  \ modern lifestyle but slowly shift into a different mode... \n\n       Walking\
  \ the Camino is a powerful teaching for patience because walking has its own pace\
  \ and one cannot cheat with the time. And it is the same in life, when we rush without\
  \ respecting a natural flow of things, we end up banging our head against a wall.\n\
  \n I remember John and Jean, the two deans of the Camino, they were so young inside!\
  \ Jean started in Paris in late August and had the goal to reach Santiago on his\
  \ birthday at the beginning of November. He would walk every day with the same pace\
  \ and dedication, the same discipline and routine but always making sure to keep\
  \ a smile on his face and showing so much wisdom! He taught me to stand up for my\
  \ own beliefs and how it was important to please ourselves before trying to please\
  \ others. \n \n One person I had a chance to meet on the Camino, Joel, a French\
  \ fellow who had long been walking the Way Saint James told me: \n\n\"When you let\
  \ go of your material possession, it is like a hot-air balloon releasing sand bag\
  \ to climb higher in the sky, your consciousness is rising up.\"\n\n It is proved\
  \ to be true! \n\n As we are all back from the Camino, sharing together we realize\
  \ how powerful the experience was. Some talk of  \"The Camino Hangover\", which\
  \ is to me when two completely different worlds are encountering each other creating\
  \ an instant chaos until you can process everything you learnt along the way, absorb\
  \ and can benefit from both experiences.  It leads you to open to the new you that\
  \ you got a chance to expand during the experience..."
