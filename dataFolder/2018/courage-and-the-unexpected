Text: "On a surf trip, two other women and I decided to take the opportunity to adventure\
  \ in the sun. Our paths crossed with an overweight, 50+-year-old gentleman by the\
  \ name of David, an author of a newly finished book - titled The Soul\u2019s Dominion.\
  \ His book stemmed from a beautiful poem by Amelia Earhart \u2013 Courage. With\
  \ curious eyes David glanced at us then our boards, mumbling under his breath, \u201C\
  Looks like fun, I\u2019ve never been surfing.\u201D By coincidence or fate, we had\
  \ a spare board, so we invited David to join.\nThe ocean is a fickle creature if\
  \ you do not know her enough to understand her, you will think she is trying to\
  \ kill you when she is simply helping you move. She must be respected and to underestimate\
  \ her power can be deadly.\nWith periodic checks on David, the three of us girls\
  \ were enjoying our rides when suddenly we realized that Davids aggressive and frantic\
  \ waving was not out of excitement, but fear. Through a lull in the breaking waves,\
  \ we could hear the panicked cry for help. Reaching David and working to get him\
  \ back to shore he spoke incessantly about the water and his fear.\nIt was in this\
  \ moment that my mind and thoughts went silent. All I could hear was the deafening\
  \ sound of the waves crashing in front of us and the sporadic splashing made by\
  \ my feet as I kicked with all my energy. Soon, even that went silent and it was\
  \ as if I was hearing the ocean through a shell, that deep listening that happens\
  \ when one holds a conch up to their ears. It was peaceful and serene and yet it\
  \ was only there for a moment.\nThe ocean is powerful; it\u2019s beautiful and exhilarating\
  \ to experience this strength and it is why I love to surf, to revel in her intensity.\
  \  But when lives are in danger, the once freeing and majestic ocean becomes an\
  \ uncontrollable monster, waiting to swallow you whole.\nFinally reaching the beach,\
  \ I could see any courage David once had for this new sport had been overwhelmed\
  \ by the intensity of the experience. I realized that here is where you find the\
  \ nucleus of adventure, the reason for courage. When all of the glamour is removed,\
  \ experiencing nature and exploring the wild is dangerous. You will have moments\
  \ of serenity and they can just as quickly be followed with moments of elated chaos.\
  \ It takes courage to step beyond the mundane and truly experience what nature and\
  \ adventure can give you. It is as Amelia Earhart states in her poem of courage\
  \ \u201CEach time we make a choice, we pay with courage to behold the resistless\
  \ day\u2026\u201D"
