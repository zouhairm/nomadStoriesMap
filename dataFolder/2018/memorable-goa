Text: 'I think Passion for Travelling comes with your soul,its the greatest thing
  happens when your inner voice strive for it.I planned for Goa with my buddIes

  those were the early days of Christmas & i felt like this will be the memorable
  trip of my life as i never before there.I saw it in movies & in pictures only &
  wondering how beautiful this place ll be.The journey started & comes to an end after
  9 hrs of hectic travelling ( but after reaching panaji which is the capital city
  of Goa felt like this 9 hrs journey is not going to be a worthless).Basically Goa
  is the Most famous & well known Tourist place in india & is visited by large numbers
  of international and domestic tourists each year for its white sand beaches as well.We
  accommodate in a resort near candolim beach which itself was a master piece of modern
  architecture. Goa is historical place ruled by Portuguese  & we all were excited
  to be the part of this Portuguese safari in india.The western side of panaji which
  have places like Candolim, Baga Beach,calangute Beach,curlies  we decided to heading
  towards it one by one, after all night life of Goa is amazingly great because of
  late night parties,pub,bar,restaurants, etc.Among this all the places, the place
  i rate higher than others was Baga Beach because of life style of peoples living
  there,Restaurants, food etc.there was something in that place which makes peoples
  to go crazy, they were dancing on music with a glass of beers in there hand,laughing,chilling
  & were cherishing each & every moment. we ended up there with our dinner & get back
  to our resort.After covering the western side of goa we planned for east.Which includes
  the places like Old goa,Basilica of Bom jesus, back water casino''s etc.Even though
  Goa has portuguese background the locals are still much familiar with Marathi as
  well as Hindi languages.After travelling for half & hour we reached to Basilica
  of Bom jesus which is also called as Old goa church was the Classic presentation
  of Historical architecture & is famous for its mind blowing art which takes breathe
  away.After finishing lunch in a local restaurant we headed towards the back waters
  of Goa where we had a session in Casino & ended up that night in high.Goa is the
  place where i actually find myself with lots of variety of food,Beaches & yes most
  importantly the beautiful peoples.All i can say travelling teaches & introduce you
  with everything so keep travelling,As life will take ur breath away one day'
