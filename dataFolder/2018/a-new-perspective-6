Text: "Venice is a city known for its romantic ambiance and iconic beauty. What they\
  \ do not tell you, is a lot of people come to see it. The tourists flood the streets\
  \ in hordes and the local inhabitants exploit naive travelers. Venetian authenticity\
  \ is greatly diminished by the \u201Ccheesy Chinese toys\u201D and designer knock-offs\
  \ sold by corner swindlers. As a fourteen-year-old boy who imagined a city of romance\
  \ and enrichment, the trash-filled canals and crowded streets were immensely disappointing.\
  \ The days passed and my family was ready to leave in hopes that our next Italian\
  \ destination would not be so unbearably American. We awoke at 5:00 in the morning,\
  \ hastily packed our bags, and promptly left the small flat we stayed in. As we\
  \ fled to the ferry, something was profoundly different. The streets were empty,\
  \ the air was fresh, and the city was quiet. Old Italian men vigorously palavered\
  \ over coffee and sfogliatelle in the city square. Beautiful young women gathered\
  \ their groceries from the local market just as the vendors laid out fresh seafood\
  \ caught just hours before. On the docks, striking young men hauled supplies off\
  \ boats and sang fisherman songs. The entirety of that morning, I heard nothing\
  \ but the sound of waves gently lifting the docks, Venetians opening up shop, and\
  \ the elegant words of the Italian people. I was in disbelief that a place that\
  \ had been so scarce in culture could be so fruitful in a matter of hours. A new\
  \ breath of life was given to Venice that morning, and in my mind, Venice became\
  \ the essence of romance."
