Text: "At the last year, I\u2019ve known new places that I\u2019ve never been thought\
  \ to be. I didn\u2019t think about how the people could be, could speak with me,\
  \ and if I will to feel me good. But I just faced it and ran to the unknown: find\
  \ out the Europe. \nFirst stop: Paris, France. I was going out the airport, very\
  \ excited for the experience, but so scared. So I asked me. What to do now? I\u2019\
  ve planned this adventure for almost twelve months, and now I don\u2019t know what\
  \ to do. I don\u2019t know, if I need some help, who will to do this.   However,\
  \ I didn\u2019t listen the voice of fear and up to the bus but when I down, was\
  \ the wrong point, because I was so nervous, misunderstanding the travel information.\
  \ I tried to use the smartphone, but it wasn\u2019t working. That was a terrible\
  \ situation that someone that want to cry. Well needes to continue to anywhere.\
  \ I was going straight, after I was backing to the same point that I down. I was\
  \ lost. First time in a different country, and lost. But someone was walking near\
  \ me and saw my face desperate. She, with long  blond hair, a smile face, came and\
  \ asked to help me. Soon, I accepted the help and she took me to the subway station\
  \ . Along the way, our talk travelled by great China\u2019s Wall, by Rio de Janeiro\
  \ and its beauty landscapes. When we arrived at the Vavin Station, she sad good\
  \ bye to go to her class. She leaved the station, but brought me peace and assurance\
  \ that no matters where we could be, we always will find some angels to make our\
  \ day happy and finish how or better than we planned.\nSecond Stop: United Kindon.\
  \ I see a beautiful  strawberry cake e go inside the coffee shop. When I ask to\
  \ the staff, he begin to laugh. O don\u2019t understand anything, so I repeat again\
  \ to him. Finnaly he says that my accent is so funny. So I don\u2019t care about\
  \ and I eat my cake and my tea. Very happy, I go outside and the man comes quickly,\
  \ laughing so much about my accent in the strawberry word. I laughed so much too\
  \ and said good bye, but I learned one lesson. I learned that independent of our\
  \ position, people are always humans, and in anywhere, we need to be spontaneous\
  \ and real, because we can make a difference in anoher lives. \nI lived a lot of\
  \ adventures travelling by Europe, but what the people said or did for me, mattered\
  \ much more, and I never can forget. So, that we could be people like these one,\
  \ because the human relationship are the most important thing ti the life."
