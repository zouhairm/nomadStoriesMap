Text: "In 2012 my love affair with Ireland began.  My dad wanted to go on a trip -\
  \ he chose Ireland.  I\u2019m forever grateful.  This moody country won my heart\
  \ almost instantly.  Dublin is a great city but give me the west coast of Ireland\
  \ any day.  Dad and I did, what I would say, is your typical \u201Cfirst trip to\
  \ Ireland\u201D tour. We toured castles, the Ring of Kerry, drank in pubs, and rode\
  \ in a hot air balloon. We toured Guinness Storehouse and ate fish and chips in\
  \ what can only be compared to a truck stop diner.  I did most of the driving with\
  \ him yelling about how close cars and cliff edges were and me yelling back at how\
  \ close busses and other cars were.\n\nWe took a Ring of Kerry tour and as the bus\
  \ slowed the tour guide pointed out a house with faded Gaelic lettering it read:\n\
  \n\u201CTeach Na Failt\xE9\"\n\nAs he said the words, tears filled my eyes.\n\n\u201C\
  Isn\u2019t it written beautifully!  This old Gaelic word means \u2018come and feast\u2019\
  \ or as you may have heard \u2018Bed and Breakfast\u2019.  \n\nThat afternoon our\
  \ Bed and Breakfast host told me Teach na Failt\xE9 actually means House of Welcomes.\
  \  From that moment forward, house of welcomes  became an anthem of my heart.  Teach\
  \ Na Failt\xE9 was the answer to what I want to be when I grow up.\n\nWhen I returned\
  \ to the States I began my quest for a house of welcomes.   However, nothing prepared\
  \ me for the residuals of Ireland. \n\nIn 2014 I spent my entire wedding fund and\
  \ went back.  I spent a week in Doolin. This tiny village has approximately 800\
  \ people, no ATM, and the most  breathtaking scenery. In Doolin, I began to find\
  \ me.  I opened to the possibility that I am more creative than I let myself believe.\
  \ This trip was just another version of Teach Na Failt\xE9.  I was welcoming me.\n\
  \nIn April of 2017, I went back to Ireland. I looked for a job and traveled the\
  \ country to see which area would be most suited for my heart.  I found the area.\
  \  There\u2019s a bed and breakfast in need of some TLC on the coast.  It will be\
  \ mine one day, but for now, I\u2019m back in the States.  My hopes to move to Ireland\
  \ have not worked out as I wanted. There are some things I need to accomplish before\
  \ I live in the land of luck.\n\nYet Teach Na Failt\xE9 doesn\u2019t ring any less\
  \ true on this side of the ocean.   In 2012, I didn\u2019t know that the bus driver/tour\
  \ guide was speaking to my identity as a human being.  I didn\u2019t know the cry\
  \ of my heart could be contained in three simple, gaelic, words.  So please, come\
  \ and feast at my dinner table.  You are more than welcome!"
