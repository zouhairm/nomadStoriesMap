Text: "My breathing was heavy, my palms were sweaty, and I could hear my heartbeat\
  \ ringing in my ears. I looked down at the the gorge-barely a trickling creek, since\
  \ it was March, height of dry season. I imagined it a flowing river, surrounded\
  \ by lush vegetation...but I would never get to see it. I continued to walk forward,\
  \ and without looking back, I threw myself off the edge! I was completely weightless---until\
  \ the massive rubberband I was attached to snapped back and my body flung back up,\
  \ defying gravity. I bounced a few more times, until the bungee cord was lowered\
  \ and I was detached from the velcro cuffs binding my ankles. As I walked the rocky\
  \ path that lead back up to the top, I felt clean and renewed, the second time I\
  \ had such a feeling of elation the past week. As I hiked upward, I reflected on\
  \ recent events and what ultimately led me to jump. \nA few days earlier, as the\
  \ train from Jaisalmer (via New Delhi) rolled to a stop at the station in Haridwar/Rishikesh,\
  \ I stared out the window. I was overcome with a feeling of pure excitement. Even\
  \ though I had traveled and embarked on \u201Cscary\u201D adventures, I had never\
  \ felt quite like this before. We grabbed our bags--which were as big as we were,\
  \ since we were traveling for three months--and headed into the crowd of rickshaw\
  \ drivers, all eager for our business. We got as far as vehicles could go and walked\
  \ across the famous Ram Jhula bridge, over the Ganges river, sacred to Hindus. We\
  \ walked down a footpath, bustling with not only people selling wares, but also\
  \ dogs, cats, chickens, and cows!\nWe came to a sprawling complex composed of pink\
  \ buildings-Parmarth Niketan, a world famous ashram, AKA our new home. We spent\
  \ the next four days in silent meditation, eating only fruits and vegetables (all\
  \ organic, of course), and practicing yoga. We dipped into the icy Ganges, its crystal\
  \ clear waters coming straight from the Himalayas, cleaning our bodies, but more\
  \ importantly our spirits. \nListening to the world-famous Pujya Swamiji was life\
  \ changing. He spoke of peace and ending suffering; he empowered us to bring the\
  \ lessons with us and to change the world. We gave colorful floral offerings to\
  \ Mother Ganges and chanted each night (Ganga Aarti), waking up early in the morning\
  \ for prayers in Sanskrit; even though they weren\u2019t understood, did not lose\
  \ their power. The whole experience left us feeling refreshed and optimistic, which\
  \ led us to bungee jump 83 meters before moving on to another incredibly holy city-Varanasi."
