Text: "In Southern New Mexico, sits the wild Organ Mountains. I was nervous but eager\
  \ to go into unknown territory. I knew little on navigation and nothing on the desert,\
  \ expect it's dangerous. I did research to  find any trails to the top, nothing.\
  \ Next, I asked around town. Repeatedly I heard, \"You shouldn't go up there, it's\
  \ dangerous,\" or \"I've been here my whole life and I've never been up there.\"\
  \ I was dumbfounded. How  can you live so close to something so beautiful and not\
  \ be curious? Frustrated, I decided to check it out myself.\nI found a couple cars\
  \ parked at Baylor Pass in front of a yellow sign. \"WARNING! You can die in these\
  \ mountains, don't attempt climbs/hikes without the ability, equipment, or time\
  \ to finish.\" I look in my bag, some water and a snack. Noted. \nI kept thinking\
  \ of rattlesnakes, mountain lions, getting lost; then I would look up and see the\
  \ mountains high overhead. After hours in the blazing sun, I made it. 360 degrees\
  \ of endless desert. I was powerful yet tiny.\nA giant cairn sat at the top. I went\
  \ to add my own rock when I see a penny heads up. It stops me cold. It wasn't just\
  \ good luck from a heads up penny. Someone left it for someone else to find; creating\
  \ a feeling, an emotion they wanted to share. Maybe they just wanted to spread a\
  \ little luck. I realized right there I was happier than ever before. I was out\
  \ of my comfort zone to try and experience something. No expectations of what, just\
  \ something. I found more than I could have expected, and I continue to look for\
  \ that something everyday.\nNow I take a penny everywhere I go. If I find that \"\
  something\" place, the bottom of the canyon, top of the mountain, middle of the\
  \ island; I leave my penny hoping that someone will cross my path. The choice we\
  \ make to go out to explore and live life should be honored, recognized, cherished.\
  \ Luck is discarded as superstitious hoopla. When you look for it; it evades you.\
  \ When it happens upon you, it's a gift. Though, it's not about finding luck, but\
  \ giving it. \nI place the penny on a cairn, a  symbol that marks a path. Trails\
  \ across country are hard to navigate, especially as time passes and the path becomes\
  \ overgrown. With cairns, even if you can't see the beaten path you can follow and\
  \ find your way. In using the cairn, I hope to show the one who finds the penny\
  \ that this is the path they have chosen. If they can realize how important this\
  \ trip, or all their trips are, then they can share it with others. Spread the gift\
  \ of discovery."
