Text: "\u201CDo you have a passport?\u201D My friend texted me in the early hours\
  \ of what was forming into a sweltering New Orleans summer morning. That text conversion,\
  \ promptly turned into an incredible opportunity to leave the United States. When\
  \ I made the request to my manager, I was prepared to quit my film gig. However\
  \ I was told, \u201CNo one should ever give up a free vacation.\u201D That\u2019\
  s right, FREE. It was a miracle and to it top off, I was getting a chance to see\
  \ the blue domed churches and amazing sunsets in rocky Santorini (Thira), Greece.\
  \ I was too excited about the journey laid out to care about any worries or fears.\
  \ My mother handled that, just fine. As I rushed to prep for my travels, family\
  \ and friends sent their well wishes and heartaches. Continuously saying, \u201C\
  Girl, I couldn\u2019t be you. I didn't realize what they meant until I boarded the\
  \ plane. It hit me like Newton\u2019s apple\u2026.gravity. This is an insanely long\
  \ flight for a lady from country Alabama. I wasn't prepared for it. However, my\
  \ travel buddy quickly calmed my nerves with the trip itinerary. Excitement budding,\
  \ I had never thought to ask for it before. What I understood to consist of Amsterdam\
  \ and Santorini, manifested into including Paris, London, Cairo, and Dubai! I was\
  \ in pure heaven! Grinning like Charlie with the golden ticket, I was blind to the\
  \ adventure that awaited me in this version of the Wonka Factory. The next 12 days\
  \ where filled with crisp smokey air, amazing views, bipolar weather, French terrorism,\
  \ lots of food, and drama! Each morning was renewed with local bites and a newspaper.\
  \ For 20 minutes, I was able to fade into foreign letters and silky nodes that waltzed\
  \ under my fingers. Afterwards, I\u2019d ready myself for the group\u2019s choice\
  \ of activities. Usually it was some cliche touristy trap that consumed the day.\
  \ Although, the Great Pyramids of Giza was a must-see. I hadn't ever witnessed such\
  \ wonders. It was boiling hot and we were not inclined to trek through the dusty\
  \ terrain. Yet, after bumpy ride with my salivating sand chariot, I was able to\
  \ experience this ancient creation. It was surreal. At that moment, another \u201C\
  apple\u201D fell. I was the first in my family, to leave the US and even more, visit\
  \ an African country. I called my mom and heard her voice crackle to the same fact.\
  \ She was proud that I took such a huge leap. Even though, nothing had gone as planned\
  \ and fears remained, the family didn't know that. They only knew that I, their\
  \ daughter, sister, and cousin, had flown around the world to be their eyes."
