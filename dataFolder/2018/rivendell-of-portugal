Text: "Just woken up from a golden slumber, Portugal stretches its back, gently turned\
  \ to the rest of Europe, and stares wistfully in the deep Atlantic waters. Spilled\
  \ over the Iberian hills, its hair suffocates the trees during summer, causing wildfires\
  \ during which black ash falls down upon the wet skin of girls and boys bathing\
  \ in the river T\xE2mega. Just as black confetti during the February Carnival. And\
  \ if the girls and boys suddenly feel sad, covered in the kindled skin of trees\
  \ consumed by fire, then they may seek consolation in the calm verses of Fernando\
  \ Pessoa.\n\nRiver T\xE2mega - with its vinho verde vineyards, its \u201Cislands\
  \ of love\u201D where many of the locals were conceived, its medieval bridge that\
  \ Napoleon failed to cross - seems like a fairy place out of Tolkien\u2019s mind.\
  \ Like Rivendell.\n\n\u201CRivendell of Portugal\u201D. This is how a Portuguese\
  \ musician describes the town of Amarante to a Polish girl on the plane to Porto.\
  \ Soon they will be gripped by passion, then she will be deceived. He will sail\
  \ away, playing his contrabass on a cruise ship like some young conqueror headed\
  \ to the New World. She will gaze westward, feeling what Portuguese women felt when\
  \ their beloved men would choose a ship in the ocean over the ship of tears in the\
  \ female eyes.\n\nDoes this story bring a mood too blue? I can tell another one.\
  \ Like that of Andr\xE9s: a witty Spaniard who arrives in Amarante to be a volunteer.\
  \ Oddly enough for a guy wearing a black leather jacket and smoking like a chimney,\
  \ he takes over the local free zumba classes to quickly become the \u201Czumba leader\u201D\
  \ of a group of middle-aged women in their fight against calories (easily burnt\
  \ on the steep cobblestone streets in Portugal, but also easily gained in a land\
  \ where a bakery lurks around each corner). He goes on to meet his soulmate Lisa,\
  \ a Londoner flute player working in the local orchestra.\n\nOr another story: that\
  \ of Tiago who brings clouds closer to children. The young Amarantean decides to\
  \ spend a year of his life in the former Portuguese colony of Cape Verde. While\
  \ co-creating theatre plays with the locals and cleaning the international debris\
  \ brought by the sea, he comes up with the idea to give a paraplanning session to\
  \ each child who proves to have read \u201CThe Little Prince\u201D. In no time the\
  \ words of Saint-Exup\xE9ry reach every child who wants to have a bird's-eye view\
  \ of their island-planet.\n\nAnd they saw the world differently: through the new\
  \ perspective of their eyes and through the words of the other."
