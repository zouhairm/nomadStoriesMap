Text: "June 24, 2013\n \nThere is something surreal about sitting on a dirt floor.\n\
  \nIncessant flies flutter about while rain drops slowly fall through the scrap metal,\
  \ plastic, wooden, rustic roof of sorts in a methodic hum.\n\nChildren run around\
  \ screaming as they play with no shoes on, a baby cries in the home next door.\n\
  \nFingers run through your hair, twisting braids while the little girls whisper\
  \ in their native tongue, thinking you do not understand. The girl in pink continues\
  \ to try to form a likeness of a braid, with no avail. The older girl, wearing a\
  \ child\u2019s dress as a shirt, continues to help her learn the craft.\n\nThere\
  \ are no men around, and you catch the word, \"botella,\" as one of the three women\
  \ shakes her head. They are standing together by the fire where the woman in a Ralph\
  \ Lauren navy polo is making tortillas out of the corn and water mixture the woman\
  \ in the dirtied white blouse just mashed with a rock.\n\nYour shoulder is tapped,\
  \ so you slowly swivel your head, as not to disturb the masterpiece being created.\
  \ The pantless, shy boy stands there with a kitten in his hand, beaming through\
  \ the water droplets glistening on his eyelashes. He remembered you told him \"\
  me gusta gatitos\" the day before.\n\nThe girl in the blue Abercrombie shirt giggles,\
  \ the shy boy still beaming, holding out his gift. Nine pairs of eyes watch as you\
  \ accept the gift, accepting one of their own.\n\nThe kitten has a white string\
  \ tied around its neck with a dull silver heart dangling. It barely looks two weeks\
  \ old.\n\nThe children love the kitten well, giving it spoiled cow\u2019s milk to\
  \ lick. They each take turns letting the kitten lay in their laps. Excitement lights\
  \ their eyes and time passes as they care for the little creature.\n\nDusk settles.\
  \ All nine pairs of eyes known that it is time to go. Nothing good happens after\
  \ dark.\n\nSweet good-byes fill the room. Tears fall faster than the rain dripping\
  \ inside, tapping on the makeshift bed in the one room home.\n\nYou give the kitten\
  \ to the little boy and make him promise to take good care of it. He is your last\
  \ goodbye.\n\nYou head towards the bus; heart wrenching, mind racing.\n\nAs you\
  \ step onto the platform, your leg is tapped, so you slowly swivel your head, as\
  \ not to show the tears. The pantless, shy boy stands there with the white string\
  \ dangling a heart in his hand, beaming as he gives you the gift. He makes you promise\
  \ to take good care of it.\n\nFebruary 28, 2017\n\nYou touch the dull, silver heart\
  \ on a frayed cream string. Promise kept."
