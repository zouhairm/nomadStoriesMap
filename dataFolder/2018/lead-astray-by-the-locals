Text: "I can\u2019t say there weren\u2019t warning signs\u2026 but I\u2019m not one\
  \ to back down from an adventure!  I\u2019m a tom boy and an explorer, so perhaps\
  \ it\u2019s this combination of things led me into this series of shenanigans with\
  \ the local boys of Montezuma. \n\nThe first red flag perhaps was the fact that\
  \ I had agreed upon the road trip with the local artisan lads thinking we were going\
  \ to nearby Santa Theresa. It was only after I\u2019d packed my hammock, my insect-repellent\
  \ and a jumper and got to the point of departure, that I realised I was wrong. Suddenly\
  \ the overnight trip had gone from the nearby Santa Theresa to somewhere \u201C\
  Only four hours away\u201D \n\nI didn\u2019t want to bail now, with two older brothers,\
  \ I have a real affiliation for being \u2018one of the boys\u2019 and so I grabbed\
  \ a $3 can of rum and coke and got stuck into the Dutch courage! \n\nIt was nightfall\
  \ by the time we left, but we were staying at Alec\u2019s uncle\u2019s place so\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019ll be fine\u201D. Six hours later we stopped at a dead end street,\
  \ and Alec put back his seat, it was time to sleep. Realising we weren\u2019t parked\
  \ outside his uncle\u2019s place, I sat a moment, pondering on my life decisions!\
  \ In the moonlight I could see some trees, and hopped out to investigate, hearing\
  \ the sound of waves, I grabbed my hammock and found some trees to sleep under for\
  \ the night. \n\nI awoke to an illuminating sunrise over a beautiful expanse of\
  \ sand, assuming this is where we would spend the day. But alas, back to the car\
  \ it was. Finally arriving at another beautiful beach, I went for a swim, got stung\
  \ by jelly fish, and joined the boys drinking on the beach to distract from the\
  \ welts now forming on my legs. As the hours passed by and the cans passed our hands,\
  \ I realised, there was definitely no designated driver!\n\nTurns out it would be\
  \ me to sober up and drive us home. \u201CWe\u2019ll take the back streets so it\u2019\
  s faster\u201D they assured me\u2026 But the backstreets weren\u2019t so much streets,\
  \ more like 4WD tracks for bush bashing through the jungle which we bravely tackled\
  \ in our little sedan. Until six hours later, so close to home, we reached a flooded,\
  \ croc-infested river crossing. We wearily waded through, checking its depth, only\
  \ to learnt it was too deep to cross. Peering at a map in the dimly lit car, to\
  \ our dismay, we realised there were no other roads, the road we took this whole\
  \ way, was our only way back. I looked at the boys, and said, \u201CThis one will\
  \ have to wait til morning\u201D and with a smile, grabbed my hammock, climbed a\
  \ fence and slept once more in the trees."
