Text: "I understood why it was called Death Road the moment I laid eyes on it. The\
  \ mountains and valleys surrounding the trail were breathtaking while the road itself\
  \ was spectacularly carved around the mountains.\n\nThe surface was loose and slippery.\
  \ Rocks the size of melons could send you over your handlebars. Cars would drive\
  \ up the road with no care for us cyclists. There were no barriers alongside the\
  \ cliff, one mistake could send you to your death. It was now or never. As we began\
  \ the decent, my girlfriend Beth lost control and nearly knocked me off my bike.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t believe she had convinced me to ride down one of the most dangerous\
  \ roads in the world. Not the most convincing way to start a bike ride named after\
  \ death.\n\nThe ride was tough. It required 100% focus as any small error could\
  \ take my life. My body was tense with anxiety. The rough road did not coexist well\
  \ with this, as every bump felt like a punch to my limbs. My hands didn\u2019t feel\
  \ any better. I have never held onto anything as tightly as those handlebars in\
  \ my life. An hour into the 4 hour ride my body began to cramp. I focused so hard\
  \ on avoiding danger that I forgot about the 600m cliff drop that was next to me.\
  \ It was the least of my worries.\n\nAt some point I\u2019d lost Beth behind me.\
  \ I was worried. As I turned a corner I saw the rest of our group had stopped so\
  \ we could catch up but Beth was still nowhere to be seen. 10 minutes went by and\
  \ then 15. Still no sign of her. 20 minutes passed and I started to fear the worst.\
  \ Finally, Beth rode around the bend with a goofy smile on her face as if she has\
  \ been riding around the local park. She was completely fine. I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but laugh, even though 2 minutes earlier I could have cried. I didn\u2019t let\
  \ her out of my sight from that point on.\n\nAfter more hours of gruelling cycling,\
  \ we saw the finish line. A pub, in the middle of a valley. By now I could barely\
  \ feel my legs or my hands. We pushed to our endpoint and celebrated as if we had\
  \ just won a gold medal. We had survived. Physically I was a wreck. My hands were\
  \ aching and my body was so sore that I could barely walk. Mentally I wasn\u2019\
  t too much better. I was tired from concentrating so hard, worrying about Beth and\
  \ trying to stay alive. I\u2019ve never been more relieved that something was over.\
  \ As terrifying as the last few hours were, they were equally as thrilling and enjoyable.\
  \ Taking on Death Road was a decision that pushed me to the edge, but thankfully\
  \ not over it, literally and figuratively!"
