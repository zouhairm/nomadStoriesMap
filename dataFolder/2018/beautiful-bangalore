Text: "During the spring of 2016 I was lucky enough to be sent to Bangalore, India\
  \ for a three month secondment as a tax advisor. I couldn't believe my luck when\
  \ the head of our team told me there was a space for me to go if I wanted to. India\
  \ had always been somewhere I'd love to travel to one day; to immerse myself in\
  \ the colours, sounds and aromas of the country along with exploring the cities\
  \ and off the beaten track destinations. So of course I said yes! I had three months\
  \ to prepare myself for the trip and ensure I had all of the necessary vaccinations.\P\
  \n\nThe first day of 'work' was two days after I first arrived; the first few days\
  \ were spent adjusting to the new time zone and getting to know the six other UK\
  \ employees who had been sent to work at the same time as me. Almost immediately\
  \ after I had sat down at my desk a beautiful bindi was plastered onto my forehead\
  \ and a gaggle of the girls on my new team circled me to ask about my life at home\
  \ - did I have a husband? Had I been to India before? Was I a vegetarian?! The answer\
  \ to all of the above was no, apart from the final question and the response to\
  \ my being a non meat eater was brilliant. A foreigner who didn't eat meat! I was\
  \ the star of the office for ten minutes and that lunchtime I was offered a taste\
  \ of so many different curries and accompaniments. I couldn't wait to try more and\
  \ that day I decided I would try as many new dishes as I possibly could and attempt\
  \ at least one cookery course so I could replicate some of these delicious goodies\
  \ for my friends and family at home.\P\n\nJust before leaving the office that day\
  \ two girls, Trashika and Aishwarya, offered to take myself and the other UK girls\
  \ to buy sarees and have henna at a local market. We all excitedly agreed to share\
  \ a taxi there and talked about which colour saree we'd like to find and looked\
  \ at photos of the latest henna designs to inspire us on the way. We finished the\
  \ evening with dinner at the girl's favourite local restaurant and sampled a host\
  \ of new dishes, not realising that we'd tried one of our favourite treats of the\
  \ trip; gobi manchurian. YUM! I went to bed full of happiness about what else would\
  \ be in store during the trip and with my gorgeous turquoise saree hanging up next\
  \ to my bed. I was in love with India at first sight, smell and taste."
