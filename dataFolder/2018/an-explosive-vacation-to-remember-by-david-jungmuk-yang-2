Text: "Now in my thirties, thirty-two to be exact, I look back on the summer of '05\
  \ and realize how fortunate my family and I was. Religious folk would swear our\
  \ guardian angels were working over time that summer. I was twenty and had just\
  \ started college. Being one of two adult children who had recently flown out of\
  \ the nest, my mom wanted to savor the little time she could find to spend with\
  \ me and my older sister. \nWe visited a famous attraction every few days and in\
  \ between we would explore London\u2019s everyday life.  The next attraction we\
  \ would plan to visit is Buckingham Palace. My sister was not keen on seeing this,\
  \ so she suggested we go early the next morning while she slept in. \nThe next morning\
  \ my mom and I woke up early to catch a bus/the tube down to Buckingham Palace.\
  \ Last minute instead we decide to get breakfast first at a Burger King by our hostel.\
  \ Upon walking out, we immediately noticed a swarm of people gathered in one area.\
  \ We suddenly noticed a lot of smoke coming from the group of people; before we\
  \ could even think of what happened, we see my sister and her friend running toward\
  \ us from the hostel. We embrace in hugs, as my sister tells us terrorists had bombed\
  \ some double decker buses and \u2018the tube\u2019 (subway). She had heard about\
  \ the events on breaking news in the hotel room, and thought we were on those same\
  \ buses. She told us she had called a bunch of relatives back home in California,\
  \ and that everyone was panicking. Even worse, and keep in mind this is back in\
  \ 2005 before smart phones, our cell phones were not working to the U.S. from out\
  \ of the country, so we had to pay a lot of money to use the hotel\u2019s phone,\
  \ call long distance, and let our extended family know we were alive. \nThe next\
  \ twenty-four hours the hotel was on lock down. And our lives went on for the next\
  \ ten plus years, and we managed to put that day behind us. I went on to graduate\
  \ college, earn a graduate degree, and start a career in the business management\
  \ industry. But to say that day didn\u2019t have a profound effect on me would be\
  \ a lie. Because it did, and not in a bad way. This day taught me to relax and enjoy\
  \ my youth, to live in the moment, not be so concerned with the future because everything\
  \ will fall into place. That if you work hard you\u2019ll get where you\u2019ll\
  \ want to be. This fateful day gave me a newfound look on religion, God, life in\
  \ general. What was stopping us from getting on that bus? Was it a lucky coincidence,\
  \ or something higher up at work? A guardian."
