Text: "The sun shone that evening on the edge of the world. Watching it sinks into\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean, I could understand how religion, maritime traditions and pagan\
  \ beliefs often mixed in the folklore of Cape Finisterre and the Coast of Death.\
  \ Looking back, those 14 days of walking had led to an unexpected yet logical end.\n\
  That romantic idea of picking up the bag pack, leaving home and following the Portuguese\
  \ Coastal Way toward the tomb of the apostle clearly had some flaws. Three days\
  \ and 90 kms later, my swollen ankles refused to move and I did not know if I could\
  \ move more, much less reach Santiago de Compostela.\nSitting on the Portuguese\
  \ bank of the River Minho, I looked at Spain from my childhood, its wild beauty\
  \ and how it opened its arms to me. In that same place, many years ago, I had left\
  \ my country and crossed a border for the first time. Again, fear and a cry for\
  \ the unknown flooded my chest. I could cross as a pilgrim or return home.\nA wooden\
  \ staff made from the branch of a tree in my hand and half the baggage donated,\
  \ I kept walking.\nThe pain was a loyal companion in those days,  making me slow\
  \ down and enjoy the journey. Arrived on the estuary of Arousa, I followed the same\
  \ route as the remains of St. James on his ship journey to Compostela, in 44 AD.\
  \ Seventeen centennial cruises along the river banks identify this part of the Camino\
  \ de Santiago as the Translatio, the origin of all paths.\nHaving reached Santiago,\
  \ the facade of its cathedral still under reconstruction made me realise that it\
  \ would not be the last time I would take off my hiking boots and lay on the ground\
  \ of Plaza de Obradoiro. Reaching the long-awaited goal was not followed by the\
  \ inner firework I had imagined. I could only finish and rest when I could not walk\
  \ any further. \nFinis Terrae, meaning Land\u2019s End, was the name given by the\
  \ Romans to the point they believed to be the most Western corner of their vast\
  \ Empire. Up until this day, those willing to extend their adventure from Galicia\u2019\
  s main city follow this ancient path. I watched as fellow pilgrims burnt some of\
  \ the clothes wore on the pilgrimage and threw the ashes into the wind. Ends and\
  \ beginnings, how thin was the line between them.   Having danced on my own wild\
  \ edges I now knew the secret was to always keep walking."
