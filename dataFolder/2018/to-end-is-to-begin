Text: "\u201CThis time I\u2019ll quit!\u201D I heard the inner voice from deep within\
  \ talking to myself. After 3 years enduring a boring office job and not being able\
  \ to find my life\u2019s purpose, I decided to quit before figuring out what to\
  \ do next.\n\nThen the next thing I knew, I was heading towards a remote island\
  \ in the far south, 1,500 km away from Tokyo \u2013 Yakushima. Rain started to fall\
  \ as soon as I reached the edge of the forest, covering the whole landscape in a\
  \ white blur. But soon enough, the morning sun peeked its intense gaze from behind\
  \ the mountain range and weakened the foggy spell. The moment its light reached\
  \ my eyes, time froze, and I could see golden particles bouncing on the surfaces\
  \ of countless droplets in slow motion. Sounds gathered and amplified in my head,\
  \ I heard the thumping of my heart, rhythmically blending in the chirping of some\
  \ faraway birds, the murmuring of the stream beneath, and the fluttering breath\
  \ of the forest in front.\n\nOne step through the forest\u2019s threshold, I found\
  \ myself at an enchanted land with trees so dense sunlight could hardly touch the\
  \ carpet of dead leaves, fog lazily hanging in the far background, damp moss and\
  \ entwined roots dominating all surfaces. Except for some thin ropes or pink flags\
  \ here and there marking the direction, there was almost no sign of human intervention.\
  \ That opened to hikers the chance to explore the forest freely: to choose a rough\
  \ and steep path or go by an easy roundabout route; or to examine a far corner before\
  \ returning to the main trail.\n\nHere, nature was left to its own cycle, many big\
  \ cedar trees were the result of two or three generations rising up and falling\
  \ down at the same spot, decomposed materials from the formers became nutrients\
  \ for the latters. Among them, Wilson Stump was one of the most magnificent examples\
  \ of the forest\u2019s great vitality, with the estimated age of over 3,000 years\
  \ and the capacity of accommodating dozens of people inside. From a certain angle,\
  \ the hollow formed a big heart looking out to the canopy above, like the great\
  \ love of our Mother Nature. Finally, marking the end of the trail was the mightiest\
  \ of all \u2013 Jomonsugi, an ancient cedar of around 3,000 \u2013 7,000 years,\
  \ towering above like a great grandfather trying to protect his descendants. In\
  \ front of \u201Chim\u201D, I felt myself so insignificant, but at the same time\
  \ so powerful as a part of this vast universe.\n\n\u201CWhat if I show the world\
  \ this beauty through my words? Becoming a travel writer \u2013 how about giving\
  \ it a try?\u201D"
