Text: "Picture it. A six day trip to Montecatini, Italy. Nothing but blue skies, culture\
  \ and perfectly crafted pasta. An island of delectation, where the evening sun breeds\
  \ romance and class, and the peach walls embrace the kiss of the evening light.\
  \ But how to get there? \n\nA 36 hour bus journey, of course. \n\nThe school had\
  \ a budget, and it seemed the best way to stay in budget was of course, a 36 hour\
  \ bus journey. Not a flight, not a train, not a boat, a 36 hour bus journey. \n\n\
  But who could resist a trip to Italy with your best friends, classmates, and even\
  \ your crush who you'd often pictured drenched in Italian sun. If a bus journey\
  \ was what it was going to take to get there, then so be it. \n\nRoughly 12 minutes\
  \ into the drive and the back row students decided to release the beautiful melody\
  \ Gangnam Style into the busses sticky air. However, a few food/toilet stops later\
  \ and a certain speakers death, and we all began to settle into our new humid home\
  \ on wheels. Seating arrangements had dilapidated and the crumbs of our food were\
  \ now deeply ingrained into the fibres of the chairs. Gangnam Style was gone and\
  \ the quiet hum of the radio was beginning to become that of a comforting purr.\
  \ \n\nSkip ahead a few nauseous rocky hours, and we had reached France. More toilet\
  \ breaks, more snacks, more conversations, more miles and soon we were in Switzerland.\
  \ More food, more laughing, more sleeping, more driving, more stretching, more drinking,\
  \ and soon we were almost in Italy. \n\nThe closer we got the thicker the air became\
  \ with sweat and excitement. More crackers, more cola, more sleeping attempts broken\
  \ by the fever of an upcoming holiday, a holiday that we knew would be a memory\
  \ we clung to on cold days.  \n\nMore sweating, more wriggling, more laughing, more\
  \ singing and finally, we were in Italy.\n\nFields of sunflowers brushing the sides\
  \ of the stretches of road, golden-tinted skies and a welcoming warm air. A 36 hour\
  \ drive completely wiped away from our memory and replaced with the unmistakable\
  \ heat and glory of a place far from home. It was a paradise.\n\nThe week went so\
  \ quickly. Infinite sunshine, ice-cream on tap and a library of fond memories created.\
  \ \n\nThe last thing I ever expected, however, was that all these doting memories\
  \ I have of Italy, are now clouded by the halcyon hours of a bus journey, I now\
  \ crave so dearly. 36 hours of complete joy and freedom in the smallest space possible.\
  \ Infinite rain, crackers on tap and a library of non stop laughter. Picture it."
