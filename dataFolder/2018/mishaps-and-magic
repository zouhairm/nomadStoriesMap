Text: "I screamed as the boiling hot water splashed on to my hand. \n  The day before\
  \ the teakettle lid decided to fall off and spill boiling water over my hand I had\
  \ arrived in Annecy, France. The sun was shining over the mountains, glistening\
  \ off of the lake in front of me as I laid down on the old wooden dock. The swans\
  \ (that\u2019s right, there were actual swans) glided on the lake near me. Later\
  \ I walked into a jewelry shop in the city center near the lake. The man that owned\
  \ the store told me that he liked to think of himself as a healer. He and had long\
  \ white hair that almost looked silver, and reflected in the many glass jewelry\
  \ pieces around the store. \n But all of this is as if it never happened as a sat\
  \ there with my hand in a bucket of ice water. After awhile the throbbing pain started\
  \ to suffice, probably just going numb from having my thumb sit in ice-cold water\
  \ for the past 20 minutes. I decided to go visit the healer I met the day before.\
  \ When I walked in the silver-haired-healer appeared from a back room. After explaining\
  \ to him the mishaps of the day before, he pulled up a chair and told me that he\
  \ was going to take the pain away from my hand. He then proceeded to perform a reiki\
  \ treatment on me. As I sat there with my eyes closed, I was expecting nothing to\
  \ happen. And then all of a sudden my thumb started to throb with a burning pain.\
  \ It was as if the kettle was standing over my thumb pouring the hot water all over\
  \ it once again. I opened my eyes as they started to water, gasping and grunting\
  \ from the pain and I watched the silver hair healer moved his hands around mine.\
  \ \u201CStay calm,\u201D he said, \u201CI am trying to pull the pain out of you.\
  \ I can feel my finger tips screaming from the heat.\u201D I clenched my eyes shut\
  \ and gritted my teeth, taking a deep breath. All of a sudden, every single ounce\
  \ of burning pain I was feeling disappeared. I opened my eyes as my jaw dropped\
  \ to the ground as I stared at the healer sitting before me. \u201CI do not feel\
  \ anything anymore,\u201D he said. Here I am one year later writing this story,\
  \ staring down at my thumb that was once bright red and covered in blisters, and\
  \ now, there is not even a scar to be seen. After thanking the silver-haired-healer\
  \ I walked down to the lake. Slipping off my shoes and dipping my toes in the water,\
  \ taking in the ominous views of the mountains and gliding swans around me, staring\
  \ at my hand that was no longer in pain, I knew for sure that Annecy had to be one\
  \ of the most magical places on earth."
