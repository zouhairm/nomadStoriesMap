Text: Recently, I had the chance to begin the journey by myself for the first time.
  The excited, the fear and the worry, it happens all the time when I decided to get
  out of a journey. But I don't see it as an obstacle. Cause the aim of this trip,
  it my dream. That dream is a few times wanted to watch the MotoGP race and see the
  work of photographers of the track. Yes, it is the main drive in pushing me to leave
  out from my comfort zone with alone for the first time. But another important thing
  that courage, the courage to follow it, which makes me dream has achieved. Courage
  gives me the courage to come out of the classrooms of the University, out of the
  same place to meet many people in the bus station, out of to talk with many people
  on the bus with the same destination. But, many reasons to travel is different,
  to sleep on a hard mattress on the bed instead of sleeping in soft beds. Go out
  to eat a local food. Cause the supermarket; it's strange for us. It is the charm
  of these things go. In those days, if I choose not to step out of the traditional
  frames. These stories would not have happened. If I chose to keep a dream in my
  mind and hurry go to sleep to the dream every night. By choosing to not push the
  limits of my own to pursue a dream to touch away, I would have been a dream. Not
  real.
