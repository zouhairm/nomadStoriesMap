Text: "The train was piercing through forests and fields, rivers and roads, past and\
  \ future.\n\nSome guy was singing in his headphones \u201CAnd the first thing that\
  \ You want\u2026 Will be the last thing you ever need.\u201D*\nThe music was nice\
  \ and easy, but what could this lyrics possibly mean?  He just shrugged his shoulders\
  \ and quickly forgot about this.\n\nHe was 22. He just graduated from college with\
  \ a degree in philology and was on his way to a new city. He didn\u2019t expect\
  \ anything in particular. He was just ready for anything that comes his way - as\
  \ his dad taught him to do. \n\nHe broke up with his last girlfriend and say goodbyes\
  \ to his college friends easily. Things changed, and he could acknowledge that,\
  \ but, at the same time, he wasn\u2019t struggling. Of course he had feelings, just\
  \ like any other human being. He was a normal person, but...When it came to feelings,\
  \ he was a beginner. You know how it is. It takes some level of maturity to allow\
  \ yourself to have strong feelings. This kind of courage is not trendy nowadays.\
  \ Fathers don\u2019t educate their sons about feelings that often. They don\u2019\
  t teach them how to swim in the Ocean of Feelings. Neither did Odysseus\u2019s father\
  \ teach him any of this.\n\n\u201CThings happen. You just need to always be ready\
  \ to deal with anything coming your way.\u201D HOW to deal with this \u201Canything\u201D\
  \ was never really discussed.\n\u201CThe last thing I ever expected is that Life\
  \ is a Vocabulary, and I am applying my own lived-out and felt-out meanings to words\u201D\
  \ \u2013 he wrote in the preface to his own vocabulary years and years later.\n\
  The train was piercing through letters and words, phrases and stories, feelings\
  \ and meanings, new stories and new senses\u2026**\n\nHe felt like he was about\
  \ to die so many times, but he was always alive after. The Ocean of Feelings never\
  \ really killed any man. *** and ****\nHe was about 40 when he met her. She was\
  \ so good with words and  feelings and in with all other subjects he studied after\
  \ \u2013 dancing, art, psychology, life\u2026etc. She was just as good as he was.\n\
  \nThey lived through many stories and  adventures before they met, so both were\
  \ ready for a much bigger adventure.\nThey were ready to live happily ever after\
  \ and withstand it*****\n\nSuch a tremendous challenge. Be ever Happy.\n\nThe last\
  \ thing I ever expected that all these tales about Love are True.\n\nMusic, used\
  \ in the text:\n*Wilco - How to fight the loneliness\n**Morris Albert \u2013 Feelings\n\
  \ *** Stereophonics \u2013 Graffity on the train\n  **** John Legend \u2013 All\
  \ of me\n   *****Nina Simone \u2013 Just In Time"
