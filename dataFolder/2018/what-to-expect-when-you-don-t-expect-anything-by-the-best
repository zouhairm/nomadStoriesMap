Text: "Not always we have the oportunity to live in another country, but when the\
  \ opportunity comes what are you first thoughts, what do you have to do with all\
  \ that feelings, througt it away, ignore it, live with them. No, you just have to\
  \ close you eyes and try to survive, yes survive, because everything you are going\
  \ to live after all is new, you\xB4ll be more alone than ever, so you have to trust\
  \ you, you\xB4ll be your best company, but in the second touhgt, that\xB4s not the\
  \ first reason you wanted to take the risk, to know yourself, to be with you, all\
  \ the people you met over there are going to tech you something, and you\xB4ll have\
  \ to take only the positives things and litter the rest. there still good people\
  \ outside, there still good dreams, don\xB4t let the fear stop you. In my last trip\
  \ to Canada I met awesome peolple, I discover things I would never know if I did\xB4\
  t take the decision to go and axplore the world, now I now I love travel, I love\
  \ to walk down the beach, into the forest, ride a bike to go to my job, to contamplaite\
  \ the sunset, to talk with people, why the act in the way the do, and the most important\
  \ what can I change for me to be better than yesterday, to never give up, and never\
  \ stop dreaming. My first day I remember I was totally lost, afraid, but you have\
  \ to start telling youself what do you want, if you there is because you are strong\
  \ enought to take chances in your life to live new experiencies, so I woke up and\
  \ try to start my day just like if I was in my own home, and try to talk to the\
  \ people just like they were family, so this makes me feel more confortable, and\
  \ at that day I never stop to think about fear I just continue day by day and one\
  \ morning I really believe that was my home, I did everything with confidence, people\
  \ knew me and the most important I trust them, and they trust me. so I start to\
  \ be happy even if I did\xB4t think about it, it just happend, so the question is\
  \ you need to know you have to ignore the fear, live with it, fight with it, or\
  \ just close you eyes for a moment, thing in all you have throut it and continue,\
  \ let in the fear loose force on you, is hard, but at the end of the day the memories\
  \ are the best you could have and thats the ones that impulse you to try again and\
  \ again and never stop living the way you ever want to, just believe in yourself,\
  \ try your best and the best always will come for you, even if you are not expencting\
  \ anything. so always write about your memories is the best way to live it again\
  \ and want to try again."
