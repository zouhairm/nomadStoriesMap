Text: As I was exploring India I found it very easy to connect with people and always
  flat on their smiles. Each and every person I have connected helps me to study their
  natural and beautiful nature by exploring it's beauty. Mainly I have explored Goan
  beauty. Goan foods, cultures, peoples everything that I have met. I was very nervous
  during my trip but this people helped me not only to explore but also to study this
  beauty from heart. I have met most wonderful persons in my life during this trip.
  They teached me how to conquer over our fear and to start new journey. The sunset
  and sunrise at beaches, konkani katar (songs). I had almost blowned away by this
  beauty. While exploring this sights I was totally mesmerized. I couldn't get over
  this excitement and people's around me. In this crowd also peoples fully supported
  me. Their lovable behavior, talk, fun that we had I never going to forget. Very
  cool,calm and peaceful on this land, watching different festivals like San jao,
  viva carnival, Indian all religions weddings. Every beauty, cultures had been filled
  in my heart and eyes. While connecting with this people never realized me who am
  I to them. They all treat as their family member. Always make me smile dance feels
  as I'm something to them or not. Number one beautiful places like beaches, waterparks,
  gardens, temples, churches, restaurants, zoos etc which teaches lots about nature.
