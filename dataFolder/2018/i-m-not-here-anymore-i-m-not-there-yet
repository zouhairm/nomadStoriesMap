Text: "My story happened to me in the highest city in Europe in Davos in the Swiss\
  \ Alps. A story about how I stepped over myself, remaining alone with the fear of\
  \ unknown peaks.\nSpending a month in Davos and working in the botanical garden,\
  \ every time I look at the tops of the Alps - I wanted to rise higher. It is not\
  \ easy to move in the environment of such mountainous landscapes. I always wanted\
  \ to stop and take a deep breath of cold alpine air. Impressions, like feelings,\
  \ disappear with time, so sometimes you need to stop to enjoy this moment. Nature\
  \ gives strength for a long time to come. I realized that it is very important to\
  \ learn how to keep it.\nDuring my stay in the mountains I managed to catch the\
  \ most amazing season. Green forests acquire a new color contrast due to chaotically\
  \ applied bright colors. In my first hike, from a height of over 1,900 meters above\
  \ sea level, I managed to track this natural transition to mountain ranges. In such\
  \ moments nothing is important, only you and what happens to you here and now.\n\
  After overcoming the height of 1900 meters, I decided to explore the National Swiss\
  \ Park, from which I lived in an hour and a half drive. I felt very good, because\
  \ during my stay here I gained incredible calm and a sense of security under any\
  \ circumstances. For the first time I learned to trust myself and my feelings, surrounding\
  \ people and their mutual help. I entered a huge forest, focused only on the signs\
  \ and the dotted line on the map. Having overcome the narrow rope bridge over the\
  \ mountain river, it became clear that today everything is in my power. Soon on\
  \ my way began to meet signs of \"bear roads\" and warning signs in the style: \"\
  Please take the headphones out of your ears, listen to the song of nature! Do you\
  \ feel good now? Enjoy! \". I independently crossed the territorial border of the\
  \ states, heading to the park from Switzerland and having cured my way already in\
  \ the north of Italy.  \nI'm not here anymore, but at the same time, I'm not there\
  \ yet. Just me, my backpack and camera.\nI did it, I could!\nWhat is now quite clear\
  \ to me: any opportunity to experience new emotions is always worth crossing the\
  \ established foundations of life. Here I mean the comfort zone, habits and even\
  \ irreparability of some things. Live right now, but do not forget to stop sometimes,\
  \ especially on mountain peaks, to remember the landscape around you. To return\
  \ home, you knew that, even though you are already here, some of you will always\
  \ remain there."
