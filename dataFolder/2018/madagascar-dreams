Text: "I said goodbye to my only friend at a rain forest hostel in Ranomafana. I was\
  \ shaking with fear while jumping out of my comfort zone and knowing very little\
  \ of the local language. I saw no other choice as my friend had ran out of travel\
  \ funds and planned to stay local, while I had an entire island to explore.\n\n\
  After I wiped my tears away, I immediately met two beautiful girls around the same\
  \ age drawing together at the hostel. I love art and clicked with these girls instantly.\
  \ Claire was from England and Ankita was from India. I told them about my fears\
  \ of traveling alone after solid conversation about travel and art and they invited\
  \ me to join their journey.\n\nThe next morning, we hopped into a packed taxi brusse\
  \ together. There were so many people that I sometimes closed my eyes and dreamt\
  \ I was somewhere more comfortable. \n\nAround 11PM, we were still making it to\
  \ the coast. The view of the starlit sky during a taxi brusse stop reminded me of\
  \ what a blessing this adventure was. I had never experienced the view of that many\
  \ dancing stars. I had never even seen clouds in the galaxy. I could not stop looking\
  \ up.\n\nMy new friends were professionals at traveling inexpensively. When we finally\
  \ did make it to a hotel, I stood quietly as they negociated the hotel price. We\
  \ paid 1/3 less than offered in signage on the walls. They had been traveling a\
  \ lot longer than me, and needed to save all they could. When it came to interests,\
  \ my new girlfriends really enjoyed relaxing and sipping on cold beverages for hours\
  \ on the beaches and shopping in touristy shops. Myself.. I wanted to do and see\
  \ so much more.\n\nI spent days snorkeling and paying for little sailboat rides,\
  \ and nights hanging out with Claire and Ankita, but my travel dreams kept growing\
  \ larger. It took at least a week to gain the courage, but I arranged for two local\
  \ sailors to take me across 1/4 of Madagascar via their tiny sailboat made of a\
  \ baobab tree. They spoke nearly no English, but I had the approval of every local\
  \ I trusted to ask with the help of hotel employees translating. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ I walked alone along a wild, salty horizon to my date with the two village sailors.\
  \ I was escorted by three wild dogs, which felt like little angels with an overly\
  \ friendly presence.\n\nI quickly realized just how little I could communicate with\
  \ the sailors, yet we seemed to understand each other well enough. The first exciting\
  \ understanding, was both of the sailors pointing at the sea and yelling \u201C\
  BELUGA!\u201D"
