Text: "My first night in Kathmandu, I try to befriend a gal who tells me her boyfriend\
  \ is arriving tomorrow and if I want to make friends, I should go rafting. I hadn't\
  \ thought to go rafting. A week later, I'm 16 km south of Tibet, next to the Bhote\
  \ Kosi River at Borderlands rafting camp\n\nAt Borderlands, I see a guitar and ask\
  \ to play it. People gather around and one of the local raft guides, Kamal, suggests\
  \ I stay and play music for guests for room and board. I meet Wade, one of the owners\
  \ to discuss.\n\n\"The boys have to like you. Not the other way around,\" he says.\
  \ It's an all-male staff except didi or 'aunty' who cooks the Nepalese staple dal\
  \ bhat for the boys. I concur, hike the Annapurna Circuit then head to Borderlands.\
  \ I stay four months. \n\nAt Borderlands, I live out of a thatched roof hut shared\
  \ with canyoning guide Dave. The two screens in lieu of windows are torn. We sleep\
  \ next to the pigs and the dogs. We have squatters, not toilets, and iodized water.\
  \ The only power source is a generator. Lamps provide night light. There is an outdoor\
  \ shower with views of terraced hills and locals collecting thatch.\n\nI play guitar\
  \ every morning next to the river and every two nights during dinner for guests.\
  \ After playing, I walk to the staff house for dal bhat. The constant fresh air\
  \ gifts me the best sleeps of my life and I bond with the boys. \n\n\"You have to\
  \ know the rules before you play the game,\" Durga, the manager, says after I tell\
  \ him I like Nabin, a raft guide. He says Westerner and Nepalese matches don't work.\
  \ He's long seen tourists hook up with or marry local guides. He says his daughter\
  \ is beautiful but dark like him, so she'll be hard to marry off. He teaches me\
  \ about life and love. \n\nNabin and I connect through music. He hand-drums while\
  \ I sing and play guitar. His brother Niroj and I bond through words. I casually\
  \ teach him English with Antoine de Saint-Exup\xE9ry's, The Little Prince. Dave,\
  \ I grow to trust with my life. \n\nAs I hang over the third cliff, water rushing\
  \ by, I wrestle with a tree, look up at Dave and have a moment. \"It's not natural\
  \ to go backwards over a cliff!\"\n\n\"It's true,\" utters Dave, \"But if you do\
  \ this one, you have to do the next one because there's no path out.\" My life is\
  \ in Dave's hands above and Niroj's below. I rappel down.\n\n\"You come back one\
  \ day,\" Durga invites. \"Bring your husband and your family. Don't forget us.\"\
  \ I don't plan on forgetting anyone. You can't unlearn, you can't undo, you can't\
  \ un-know a bond that's true."
