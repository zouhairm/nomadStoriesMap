Text: "The best travel stories often come from the worst moments. \n\nOne St. Patrick\u2019\
  s Day, I had the fortune to be in Dublin, Ireland. It was a long enough layover\
  \ that there was time to visit Malahide Castle. \n\nThe plane landed an hour early\
  \ and customs was quick. I was on my way to the bus stop when I encountered the\
  \ escalator. Not just any escalator, but a long, narrow plummet. \n\nWe all have\
  \ our weaknesses. Escalators are mine. I looked for the nearest elevator, headed\
  \ toward one, pushed through some doors, got inside, down to the lower floor, out,\
  \ and encountered doors that would not open. What was going on? I could see the\
  \ public bustling past on the other side and I appeared to be in some sort of maintenance\
  \ area. \n\nThat\u2019s when I realized I was behind security in the Dublin Airport.\n\
  \nI got back in the elevator and to where I started only to find that the doors\
  \ I\u2019d pushed to get in would not let me back out. I called \u201CHelp!\u201D\
  \ whenever I saw someone. This caused no small ill ease. One man even backed away\
  \ slowly, looking around like he was hearing voices. Finally, an airport worker\
  \ let me out with a gentle admonishment to go quickly; I could be fined. \n\nI white-knuckled\
  \ the escalator, abandoned the idea of a bus, and found my way to the first cabbie\
  \ in line.\n\nCabbies are the unsung heroes of the travel world. Cab drivers have\
  \ come through when I\u2019ve hit transportation impasses in Sedan, France and Midtown\
  \ Manhattan. They have also given some of the best tours. In this case, the brown-sweatered\
  \ cab driver, who had once been a history professor, proceeded to give me a tour\
  \ of the town of Malahide where we saw locals in shamrock green coats and hats and\
  \ strapped-on ruddy beards heading to the St. Patrick\u2019s Day Parade in Dublin.\
  \ He pointed out the golf course on a flat, grassy island out in the Irish Sea.\
  \ Then, he took me to Malahide Castle. He said he\u2019d just wait for me in the\
  \ cab, but instead he gave me a complete tour of the green grounds, pointing out\
  \ different kinds of exotic vegetation, and detailing the history of the buildings,\
  \ some of which had never known roofs in an effort to avoid paying high taxes. The\
  \ castle belonged to the Talbot family for 791 years; Richard Talbot was one of\
  \ Henry II\u2019s knights. \n\nWe were back at the airport in plenty of time to\
  \ get through security. Since he had been cab driver and tour guide, I paid him\
  \ for both. He was astonished. \n\nMoral of the story? One moment\u2019s misfortune\
  \ can lead to the next moment\u2019s opportunity."
