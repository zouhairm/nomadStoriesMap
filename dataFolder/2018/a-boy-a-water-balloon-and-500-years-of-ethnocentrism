Text: "When writers use the old cliche, \"There is no joy like...\" and do not finish\
  \ with, \"a boy and his water balloon,\" they are mistaken. This particular boy,\
  \ with his joyous grin and bulging water balloon, hangs out of an apartment that\
  \ is flaking and crumbling like old paint. He taunts us.\n\nIt is hot. It is March,\
  \ and the town is colorful and wet. We are a 2-hour train ride, 1-hour bus ride,\
  \ and 30-minute taxi ride away from the nearest international airport and we don't\
  \ speak the language. \n\nThe town is called Aguas Calientes, fitting for a town\
  \ that enjoys occasional, rapid-fire water fights for apparently no reason. Water\
  \ balloons, water buckets, and water guns, really anything you can get your drenched\
  \ hands on, is fair game. As far as we can tell, it is a festival where the country's\
  \ old patriarchal heritage is thrown out the window, and with it comes water. Local\
  \ girls scramble to find perches in the apartments that tower over the town's main\
  \ cobblestone pathways to hit the cutest boys. It is, I think, a scene straight\
  \ out of a French movie, albeit with less nudity. \n\nWe wind our way through the\
  \ steep alleys searching for our apartment while dodging water. For the greater\
  \ part of our, rather confused, journey we are ignored. We are tourists; our luggage\
  \ acts as a white flag.\n\n3-year-olds are funny that way. They usually ignore white\
  \ flags. The dangling boy with the water balloon is no different. As he pops in\
  \ and out of the apartment window, black hair askew, it becomes clear he is making\
  \ a difficult decision. It may be the most difficult decision he has ever made.\n\
  \n\"Should I peg these tourists with this water balloon? Or should I use this, surprisingly\
  \ huge for a toddler, bucket?\" he wonders, probably with less editorial.\n\n\"\
  Look,\" I whisper to my unsuspecting partner, motioning to the boy. \"Do you wanna?\"\
  \n\nThe boy waits in anticipation, smiling and knowing.\n\nWe look up at the child,\
  \ take a moment to give him our consent with a grin, and sprint. \n\nCatching my\
  \ breath at the other side of the alley, I stop. This 3-year-old, I think, the one\
  \ almost too small to be left unsupervised this close to a window, is amazing. He\
  \ speaks without words, he waits for consent, and although we look so much different\
  \ than him, he includes us.\n\nAfter 5 years of traveling to countries and feeling\
  \ bad for my nationality and my country's history with the places I visit, I finally\
  \ feel forgiven.\n\nThere is no welcome like that from a boy and his water balloon."
