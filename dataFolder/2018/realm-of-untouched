Text: "A new venture in the winters took me to the Untouched wilderness of sikkim.\n\
  A small state in India. Which beholds immense amount of treasure that no pirate\
  \ could conquer. In the sultanate of skies where mountains serve as thrones where\
  \ no king ever sat. There's a stretch of highway through which it takes around 4hrs\
  \ to reach sikkim.. That place had some immense scenic beauty I had ever seen in\
  \ my life.The river along side us that was full up to the brim was more bluer than\
  \ the color itself that I have ever seen.And the mountains sculpted around it. I\
  \ was stuck.I could feel the depth in my eyes like that of a newborn has when it\
  \ opens it's eyes for the first time.There were small lights glowing in the mountains\
  \ from people's homes. Crickets chirping. Cold air was blowing at my face while\
  \ driving. I didn't wanted to turn on the music. Be distracted by thoughts. I wanted\
  \ to take it all in. To be one with the place. I checked into my hotel and went\
  \ to the room. Lying in the bed I was wondering what tomorrow holds as you can plan\
  \ a trip but not a Journey. \n. The red skies and the green mountains reminded me\
  \ of those English poets that I used to read in school whom I couldn't relate to\
  \ as a kid. Yet now I know.. I was well accompanied by mountain, streams, vast skies.\
  \ Himalayas which is the highest range in the world was beside me which wrapped\
  \ the clouds around it like shawl in winter.It was cold around. My chattering teeth\
  \ made it clear that I was in the Himalayas.Early chilly morning in that village\
  \ where we stayed was a sight to behold. The Rocky mountains of night tucked there\
  \ peaks with snow in the mountains. I had some tea before leaving for Yumesdong.\
  \ Those roads made me wanna be free as those gypsies who are too wild to tame. From\
  \ a height those roads seemed like a serpent wrapped around the mountains. With\
  \ leaves turning orange mountains blue and white my camera was overwhelmed with\
  \ such vivid colors. When we reached yumesdong it seemed like arctic with no trees\
  \ or a person as far as eyes can reach. Rocks snow and streams showed me what kind\
  \ of winter was described by poets.by Living in the tropical regions I didn't really\
  \ knew what harsh winters looked like. Yet there were those purple flowers blooming\
  \ as the ray hope. Teaching us the nature of life. After sometime We had to take\
  \ our leave keeping  vivid live images in our minds."
