Text: "As I sat atop a hill overlooking a remote village called Khun Don in the PaO\
  \ speaking region of Myanmar, I placed my ear against a sky blue section of PVC\
  \ pipe resting in a trench. For the past week, a group of dedicated volunteers and\
  \ locals have worked tirelessly to dig this trench and connect a mile and a half\
  \ long pipeline to a concrete tank and various taps. The story of why we were here\
  \ is one of water. People in rural Myanmar often lack access to clean water, or\
  \ water at all. Many walk incredible distance to obtain water, while others settle\
  \ with disease-ridden water close by. Health problems are abundant because of unsafe\
  \ drinking water in these rural areas. \n \nThe group that I travelled to Myanmar\
  \ with looks for villages that have the need for water and that are willing to help\
  \ with the construction process. All of the money for the projects is raised in\
  \ the USA and spent on supplies in Myanmar. Construction is not the only goal of\
  \ our group, however. Just as much if not more time and effort is focused on education\
  \ of the villagers that we work with. We teach them how to sterilize their water\
  \ by boiling it. We give the people clean containers and explain to them that it\
  \ is unsafe to drink from old motor oil canisters. Giving people access to water\
  \ is not so useful if they do not use it correctly. \n\nAs I sat upon that hill\
  \ with my ear eagerly pressed on the pipeline, I heard the water coming through\
  \ the pipe for the first time, and I burst into tears. Crying was not something\
  \ that I had expected to do on this trip. But the sound of water flowing from the\
  \ mountain spring down to the village invoked powerful images in my mind. I thought\
  \ of all of the people that would benefit from having access to this water. I imagined\
  \ the children of Khun Don playing in the spray of the faucets on a hot and humid\
  \ Myanmar day. I considered all of the time we saved people from having to carry\
  \ water across a large valley. But most importantly I realized that these outstanding,\
  \ hardworking people would no longer have to worry about getting sick from drinking\
  \ water. As I sat there with tears flowing down my face, one of the project mentors\
  \ came down to check if I had any problems hearing water. When she saw that I was\
  \ crying, she insisted that this amazing project could not have been completed without\
  \ each individual here. We had helped deliver something of infinite value to the\
  \ people of Khun Don, Myanmar, and I will never forget the emotions that made me\
  \ feel."
