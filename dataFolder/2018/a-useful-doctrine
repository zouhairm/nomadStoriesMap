Text: "It is the middle of Summer in the Alps. I am soaked to the marrow, my right\
  \ knee is comically swollen, and I have eaten a single carrot in 17 hours. A charnel\
  \ fog is obscuring everything on this high crest and skin-splitting gusts are threatening\
  \ to drive me into a valley 2,400 metres below. I am more concerned, cold, and physically\
  \ degraded than ever before in my life. I am having a wonderful time.\nI should\
  \ explain.\nMy friend Sam often has wonderful ideas. We have been friends for 10\
  \ years and a month previous, with a glint in his eye and several beers in his gut\
  \ at one of our regular outings in the weary Northern town we grew up in, he first\
  \ proposed to me a \u201Cnice hike\u201D through the French, Swiss and Italian Alps,\
  \ the Tour du Mont Blanc. \nSat in the pub, we began our research, which revealed\
  \ the project to be a 170-kilometre trek with 8,900 metres of ascent lasting around\
  \ 11 days. In retrospect this information should have detained us, but Sam and I\
  \ have a knack for quieting our reservations with a 3-word doctrine: \u201Cthis\
  \ is fine.\u201D Bespelled by the effervescent truth of such a statement, the information\
  \ we just discovered served only as a minor speed bump to our bravado-powered clown\
  \ car, by now hurtling towards the Ryanair website. When the haze cleared the next\
  \ morning, the trip was booked. \nA month later, having completed a minimalist training\
  \ regime, we are stood in a field in rural France, burdened like dray horses and\
  \ with a morning sun blistering our pallid Lancastrian faces. Our first couple of\
  \ days are predictably infernal: the skin of my feet winces with each step and my\
  \ muscles feel like they\u2019re sloughing off my femurs like a slow-roast as we\
  \ drag ourselves uphill. \nWe are not made for, nor have we prepared ourselves for\
  \ anything like this. By the close of the first day we are at a low ebb, by the\
  \ second we are below sea level, and by the third we are mining the bowels of the\
  \ earth. At our nadir, though, both of remember the fervour of the night we planned\
  \ the trip, and the words which will guide us through the trip: this is fine.\n\
  It is surprising what you can get used to if you convince yourself that things are\
  \ broadly fine. Before too long, the sheer power of ignoring our problems has melted\
  \ our aches, lightened our packs and blown open the previously bolted realm of possibility.\
  \ We are still tired, still sore and still wondering why we came here, but we have\
  \ taken control of ourselves and our situation: this is fine."
