Text: "Deciding to walk around Japan with nothing but Google Maps taught me multiple\
  \ lessons in humility. By the end of several disasters, I knew not to be careless\
  \ with place names. I knew not to walk illegally down the sides of freeways because\
  \ I hadn\u2019t rerouted early enough. I even knew when to give up and find public\
  \ transport\u2013\n\n\u2013except that obviously I didn\u2019t, because if I had,\
  \ I would never have ended up at the top of that mountain in Hakone.\n\nI was trying\
  \ to get to Hakone Kowakien Yunessun, a hot spring theme park featuring caffeinated\
  \ and alcoholic baths. I had always found the idea of public hot springs embarrassing,\
  \ but I was happy to get naked with strangers if it meant bathing in green tea.\n\
  \nThe theme park was only meant to be a thirty-minute walk from the station. Somewhere\
  \ past the hour mark, I began to suspect that I wasn\u2019t anywhere near where\
  \ I was supposed to be. The neat concrete pavement \u2013 which had grown narrower\
  \ as the forest ate into it from both sides \u2013 had given way to gravel. The\
  \ reassuring stone barriers that had seemed to hold the looming mountainside in\
  \ place were now nothing more than worn wooden fences.\n\nI peered closely at my\
  \ phone. No reception. I kept walking.\n\nThen the road disappeared entirely.\n\n\
  Two enormous logs stood vertically before me. The one to my right was crowned by\
  \ some rocks that were arranged to look a little like one of those ojizousans, or\
  \ stone guardians, present everywhere from temples to roadsides in Japan. The log\
  \ to my left was capped by an upside down noodle bowl. Surrounding both pillars\
  \ were a series of misshapen branches and bamboo logs tilted precariously against\
  \ one another.\n\nI looked past the stone guardian, and the noodle bowl, and the\
  \ rusty chain that connected them, and saw a patchwork of bare branches, autumn\
  \ leaves, and foliage that was a dark, \u2018Japanese\u2019 green that I\u2019d\
  \ never seen in the bleached leaves of Australia. It was impressive, but it was\
  \ also totally unfamiliar, and I finally admitted to myself that I was lost. I had\
  \ arrived at the edge of a path, on the edge of a mountain, well outside the edge\
  \ of my feeble mobile network reception.\n\nI felt triumphant.\n\nDespite Google\
  \ Maps, despite location and navigation services, despite every advantage given\
  \ to me by modern technology in one of the most technologically advanced countries\
  \ in the world, I had gotten lost on a mountain. I smiled at the foreign landscape,\
  \ at the logs, at the noodle bowl, and said to myself, \u201CWell done.\""
