Text: "Sometimes, situations in life inadvertently pushes you into the deep end of\
  \ the proverbial swimming pool, where you have only two options. So what do you\
  \ do? You can either flap your hands like a headless chicken and drown, or you take\
  \ the challenge head on and rise to the surface. \n\nThis is exactly what happened\
  \ to me in 2009, when I had the opportunity to work in Uzbekistan during the economic\
  \ recession that had plagued half the world. Fortunately for India, it did not affect\
  \ us until the latter half of 2008. Since I had been rendered jobless and I thought\
  \ of using this chance to cure the peripatetic state of mind that I was in, I went\
  \ for it! \n\nFor the first month or so it was like a honeymoon period, where I\
  \ was coming to terms with the destination and the fact that I was going to be away\
  \ from my family for the first time in my life. Uzbekistan is honestly not one of\
  \ the best places to reside in because of the underlying effects of the Communist\
  \ Regime, the language problem and the fact that it was acute winter when I went\
  \ there. However, I spent my time in taking extensive walks around the capital,\
  \ Tashkent where I was based and familiarising myself with the people, the culture,\
  \ the food and the language. I started behaving and moving around like a local so\
  \ that I could feel at home.\n\nI did quite a lot of inbound business with the local\
  \ Destination Management Company or DMC that I was employed with, but after almost\
  \ 10 months I had had more than my share of roughing it in this country without\
  \ any support system to bank on and even though I am all about experimenting with\
  \ a potpourri of cuisines, I was acutely yearning for homecooked food.\n\nWithout\
  \ any opportunities on the horizon in India, I started getting homesick, morose,\
  \ increasingly negative and was fast losing interest in my job at hand. Then like\
  \ a blessing in disguise, the Vice President of the company that I was dealing with\
  \ in India for sending us business mentioned to me that he was in need of professional\
  \ tour directors for his outbound groups to various parts of the world.\n\nAfter\
  \ heaving a huge sigh of relief and profusely thanking him, I immediately packed\
  \ bag and baggage with an excuse to my employer that I wanted to go for a holiday\
  \ as I had a wedding in the family, and beat a hasty retreat back to India. This\
  \ was on account of him not treating me professionally and I knew that if he knew\
  \ the real reason, he would have made matters difficult for me.\n\nI was lucky,\
  \ but not everyone is."
