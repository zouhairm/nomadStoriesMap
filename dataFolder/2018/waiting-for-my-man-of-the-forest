Text: "It was hot and humid. I was dressed in a long sleeved shirt, trousers with\
  \ leech socks tied tightly around my knees and a wide brimmed hat. I wore a trusty\
  \ pair of \"Adidas\" kumpongs on my feet that I bought for 10 Malaysian ringgits\
  \ (about \xA31) which the locals in the Kota Kinabulu market assured me would help\
  \ me to navigate the jungle terrain better than any expensive boots I had brought\
  \ with me from the UK. \n\nExternally I looked the part of a true explorer. Internally\
  \ my head was spinning and I felt nauseus due to a uneasy relationship between the\
  \ malaria pills I was injesting and my own body chemistry. \n\nWe had been hiking\
  \ in the Danum Valley rainforest in Malaysian Borneo, cautiously traversing the\
  \ slippery roots of the towering fig trees for over two hours, almost entirely uphill.\
  \ My heart was pounding in my chest and my breaths were coming quickly and although\
  \ I was invigorated by the lush landscape and the cacophony of insect song around\
  \ me, I felt the need to rest for a moment. \n\nI urged my guide, husband and two\
  \ others in our group to hike on without me, knowing they would loop back in about\
  \ thirty minutes and meet me at the jungle pool which was to be our rest and swimming\
  \ stop. They agreed and continued walking upwards while I turned back and headed\
  \ about a quarter of a mile downhill towards the meeting point. \n\nWalking alone,\
  \ fully immersed in the Borneo jungle, my senses immediately heightened and I began\
  \ to worry about the teeming, unfamiliar life forms that surrounded me. I walked\
  \ quickly to my destination, but slowed down in awe when I reached it, visually\
  \ taking in the sight of the paradise oasis surrounded by thick, moss covered trees.\
  \ A cool pool of water was fed by a cascading waterfall that began high in the jungle\
  \ and the earthy smell of vegetation hit my nostrils.\n\nThere was a lopsided picnic\
  \ table on which I placed my bag and I began to undress into my swimsuit. The water\
  \ was cool and inviting after the intensity of the heat as I began to immerse myself\
  \ more deeply, I heard a rustling in the trees behind me. Thinking the rest of my\
  \ group had arrived, I turned abruptly, only to see before me a young, curious adolescent\
  \ orangutan emerging from the undergrowth, eyeing me with curiousity. \n\nI stood\
  \ motionless, breathless, and even though I could feel the fish nibbling at my feet,\
  \ all time stopped as I maintained eye contact for a full minute with this man of\
  \ the forest before he turned and disappeared back into the jungle."
