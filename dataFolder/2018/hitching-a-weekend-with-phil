Text: "Two girlfriends and I hadn\u2019t made many specific itineraries when we flew\
  \ to Maui from Vancouver, BC. We simply couldn\u2019t have passed up a round trip\
  \ cheaper than going home to Ontario if it also meant we could be warm and camp\
  \ on beaches. Turns out our backpacks were too large to ride public transit so we\
  \ had to navigate the island with our thumbs up. It was getting dark when we were\
  \ walking the side of the highway hoping to get from Kihei to Lahaina; not exactly\
  \ a comforting predicament for 3 19yo ladies. Phil pulled over in his beat up pickup\
  \ and when he told us he could only take us halfway because he was hiking the windmill\
  \ trail, we knew we had hit the jackpot. If it weren\u2019t for our comfort and\
  \ strength in numbers, things may have ended up differently, but we accepted his\
  \ invitation to join on the hike and crash at his loft that night. We met up with\
  \ a friend of Phil\u2019s and hiked the windmill trail by headlamp, turning them\
  \ off at the top. From Pu\u2019u Kukui we could see many of the towns scattering\
  \ the shores of the island, and islands beyond that, not to mention the stars. We\
  \ bonded quickly with Phil and were so intrigued by how knowledgeable he was on\
  \ the islands\u2019 culture and nature, and appreciated how keen he was on sharing\
  \ information. He didn\u2019t have plans for the weekend and one thing we did know\
  \ that we wanted to see in Maui was Hana. Conveniently he had a season camping pass\
  \ to Hana National Park and accordingly we met back up a few days later and headed\
  \ down the infamously windy and lush highway. It was everything we imagined and\
  \ more; from the plethora of great waterfalls to beaches red and black, to the overwhelming\
  \ canopy and breathtaking twilights. Hana breathes with you and never lets you forget\
  \ that you\u2019re in a biodiversity hotspot. We were constantly surrounded by a\
  \ pleasant humidity and so many endemic plants pointed out by Phil. We collected\
  \ countless lilikois on the Pipiwai trail and enjoyed them under mist from a waterfall\
  \ and a fierce afternoon sun. You could sense the local communities\u2019 strong\
  \ ties to the land and its blessings, while still feeling welcomed at the campground\
  \ and secret swimming spots. Everyone we encountered had an air about them that\
  \ was blissful and aware of the immense beauty around them. We met people from all\
  \ over the world who found this tiny niche of diverse evolution where we could all\
  \ find a sense of belonging. Phil guided us and taught us so much, so needless to\
  \ say we were thankful our bags were too big."
