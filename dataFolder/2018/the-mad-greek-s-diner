Text: "We got off the freeway for gas. We had been in the desert for the last few\
  \ days. We'd seen the lights of Vegas, the great darkness the Grand Canyon became\
  \ at night, miles of road, and an exhausting number of alien roadside attractions\
  \ and repetitive gas stations. We got gas at the first place we saw. It was pricey.\
  \ We filled up and wanted to grab something to eat. They had exactly what you'd\
  \ expect, but expensive, so we decided to leave. \n\nDriving down Baker Blvd, we\
  \ passed alien caf\xE9 after extra-terrestrial diner ad nauseum. We came to a blue\
  \ building surrounded by white statues. \"Oh God, no more,\" I thought. But Angelica\
  \ said \"look!\"\n\nIt was no alien caf\xE9. It was The Mad Greek, a roadside diner\
  \ painted a labyrinthine patchwork of blue and white, littered with various statues\
  \ and golden topped columns. The blue ceiling beams were covered in the word \"\
  welcome\" in every language. Between the old photographs, marble, indoor plants,\
  \ and paintings of Greek landscapes, we marveled celebrity patrons of old \nWho\
  \ had written dedications to the Mad Greek.\n\n\"What will you have?\" an older\
  \ woman asked us. We decided on falafel, babaganoush, and Greek coffee. We asked\
  \ her about the Mad Greek. She frowned. \"He died not too long ago. But, his son's\
  \ over there,\" she said pointing to a man waiting for food. \n\nWe walked over\
  \ to the man and congratulated him on his caf\xE9 and gave our condolences for his\
  \ loss. He told us about growing up with the Mad Greek, the diner that was his father's\
  \ dream, and how he's tried to keep it alive. They expanded recently, he said, to\
  \ a location across the border in Nevada. They also had many billboards. It was\
  \ wonderful that he was keeping such a thing going, I told him. The desert needs\
  \ unique things to contrast the corporate gas stations and alien apparel shops.\
  \ They called our food. He smiled and thanked us for our business.\n\nWe got our\
  \ food in a brown paper bag and two small cups of dark, grainy, coffee. Angelica\
  \ wanted to get some sugar for hers. As she did that, I looked up and was taken\
  \ aback by a wordy black and white letter board with the heading: Famous Greeks\
  \ (Hellenes). It included Plato and Socrates, but also Odysseus, Achilles, and Pegasus.\
  \ Of course, the Mad Greek himself was there. Below that, there was a section for\
  \ honorary Greeks. I smiled when I saw the crew of the Mad Greek listed near James\
  \ Joyce and St. Paul. It went on to include you, our customers, and that beautiful\
  \ lady. \"They listed you, Angelica,\" I said."
