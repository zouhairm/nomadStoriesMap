Text: "The relentlessly hot bus meandered through dusty desert towns to a kibbutz.\
  \ On arrival I sat on the western shore of the Sea of Galilee, overlooked by the\
  \ Arbel cliffs. A lonely turtle struggled to swim through the current. Ripples chased\
  \ each other in an unpredictable fashion that only nature can master. Inquisitive\
  \ dragonflies hovered by the reeds and flocks of migrating birds beat their wings\
  \ against the tough, gusty wind. \n\nI\u2019d found my sanctuary.  \n\nEarlier that\
  \ week, huddled in a heap and scrunching into a ball of loathsome energy, I sobbed.\
  \ Workplace bullying had put my life under a dark cloud of pessimism and finally,\
  \ my spirit broke. \n\nQuitting my job, I booked a one way ticket to Israel. The\
  \ flight was lively and surreal; black brimmed hats and kippahs sat atop many heads\
  \ and on landing everyone cheered. Stepping from the plane, the 48 degree air enveloped\
  \ me. Sweat crept across my skin as I realised I was still wearing English attire.\n\
  \nIn Ginosar my home was a bed and a kitchen, perfect simplicity! I shared a garden,\
  \ and the social warmth of the kibbutznikim abounded, \u201CYalla, come join us.\u201D\
  \ Lazy cats and dogs lay in various shaded positions to escape the day\u2019s heat.\
  \ A feast with gigantic proportions of sweet meat, salad and hummus was laid out.\
  \ By nightfall, I\u2019d noted Hebrew phrases to practice and made new friends.\
  \ \n\nIn the quiet of the A.M, I went to seek the waterside again. Looking across\
  \ the still lake, the tension I\u2019d been carrying began to leave. In that moment\
  \ I gained an impervious tranquillity. Waves of relief and a manic happiness lifted\
  \ me from the dock and I waded in. Sharp stones sank into bare feet and invigorated\
  \ my senses; the stinging numbness that had invaded my life melted into pure sensation.\
  \ \n\nLiberation! Freedom! Hurrah! Alive with vigour I wanted to shout but caught\
  \ the bubble of energy in my throat with a childish grin. It felt like the discovery\
  \ of a new room in an old house. Although, this wasn\u2019t the moment of release\
  \ I\u2019d had in mind. I expected dancing in the streets with copious amounts of\
  \ alcohol, a celebratory indulgence. Here I was, silently standing in a lake; a\
  \ solitary figure with innumerable possibilities and a thousand realities to explore.\
  \ \n\n The rising sun spread reflections of bamboo stalks on the burnished, liquid\
  \ surface. Sleep willed me towards my bed. With a happy heart and my mind at rest\
  \ I ambled home. After such fever of anticipation, I recalled my week and thought\
  \ \u201CDepression has no hold here.\u201D"
