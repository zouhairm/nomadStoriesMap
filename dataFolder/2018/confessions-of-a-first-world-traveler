Text: "Women and men walk past me carrying loads of produce on their backs. They are\
  \ hovering over due to its heavy nature. Today I am in Ollantaytambo, Peru where\
  \ family ranks over everything here. When it comes to responsibilities, there are\
  \ no gender biases. \n\nMy best friend Gabby and I flew into Peru early in the morning\
  \ and took a taxi straight to our hostel. The moment we arrived, I immediately saw\
  \ the dirt that was dusted all around the floor. It was uncomfortably small for\
  \ a room holding 10 other travelers. There were fewer outlets than people, one bathroom,\
  \ a creaky twin size bed for each person and the wifi was non-existent. I silently\
  \ complain to myself about the conditions but carry on not wanting it to ruin my\
  \ vacation.\n\nWe came to Peru to see Machu Picchu. But today, we are horseback\
  \ riding. So after we unpack, we venture on to the main square where our guide Pedro\
  \ is waiting with two horses. I hop on, ready for my ride across the town.\n\nPedro\
  \ is a local and only speaks Spanish. Gabby speaks English and Spanish so she begins\
  \ to ask him questions about the town. I fall out of earshot and am left to my own\
  \ thoughts. \n\nI focus my attention on all the houses and locals. I wave to everyone\
  \ I see. They all wave back with a smile. A city that thrives from tourism, it's\
  \ no wonder why they are so kind. Each house we pass has tin roofing with several\
  \ car tires weighing it down. I hear the soft patter on the tin roofs before I feel\
  \ it on my face. It was starting to rain. I look up at the houses once more. I watch\
  \ each owner hang up a tarp on their patio to block the rain. Their calm demeanor\
  \ tells me this is common routine.\_It suddenly begins to downpour on us and we\
  \ turn around because it's has obstructed our pathway.\n\nAfter exploring the town,\
  \ I realize quickly that my complaints of the hostel are what people consider \"\
  first world problems\". I think to my life in Los Angeles and how I've grown accustomed\
  \ to the flashy lifestyle. I've become blind to the day to day of an underdeveloped\
  \ country like Peru. Half the country is living in poverty with limited resources.\
  \ Yet they are surviving and are happy.\n\nThere's a lesson to be learned from their\
  \ simplistic ways. For the rest of my trip, I reset my mind. I am now grateful for\
  \ my creaky bed, dusty floor, and wifi-less room. I have more than I could ask for\
  \ in my life and from now on I plan to appreciate it all."
