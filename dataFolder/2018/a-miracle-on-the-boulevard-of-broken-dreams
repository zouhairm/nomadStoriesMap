Text: "We chased after our desires, by booking a one-way flight to Los Angeles, and\
  \ our only plan being 'to make it.' My partner and I shared the same internal yearning\
  \ for adventure, and a burning passion for musical success. \nDay by day, we headed\
  \ ceaselessly to the famous Hollywood Boulevard to play music on the street, but\
  \ with the competition of gangsters' hustling hip hop CD's and five versions of\
  \ Jack Sparrow fighting for attention, it was hopeless. I\u2019d heard people calling\
  \ it the Boulevard of broken dreams; the place where once-auspicious artists come\
  \ to take their last bow. Homeless people lay on every street corner, drug addicts\
  \ beg for their last pennies, and street artists fake smiles as they live in despondency.\
  \ It seemed so funny to me that a street which hosted red carpet events also housed\
  \ so many forsaken souls. That a disinherited ex-marine stood holding a broken cardboard\
  \ sign just metres away from one of the biggest record companies in the world. \n\
  But in this seemingly futile place, a miracle happened. \nWe were almost finished\
  \ playing our set, when a group of three, suited men in sunglasses stopped to listen.\
  \ About half an hour later, we were escorted to one of the most famous hotels in\
  \ the world, \u2018The Hollywood Roosevelt.\u2019  \LIt felt like a crazy dream\
  \ - moments ago we had been dragged from the street and were now sitting in a Tropicana\
  \ bar, celebrities like Miley Cyrus and The Killers were walking in the midst, drinks\
  \ and salads were on the house. We were given a gig at the hotel, $200 a night,\
  \ and promised links to all the major record labels. \nWe were living like Kings.\
  \ Through the day, we hit Santa Monica beach. We rollerbladed down Venice beach\
  \ boardwalk, hair gliding in the air. We sat on the lifeguard huts watching the\
  \ sunset over the horizon. By night, we drove through the city to gig in Hollywood.\
  \ We met photographers, models, we were asked to be interviewed, and people wanted\
  \ to have their pictures taken with us. It was like some crazy, but wonderful dream\
  \ that we never wanted to end. \nIn that moment, I remember realising that no matter\
  \ what happened, we had made it in our own way. We had made what most people told\
  \ us was impossible, achievable. \nEven if we never ended up on the Hollywood walk\
  \ of fame, we have our own Hollywood story to tell."
