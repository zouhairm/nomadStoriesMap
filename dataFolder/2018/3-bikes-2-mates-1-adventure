Text: "Mauricio, a Bolivian mountain biking legend, changed our riding plan. \u201C\
  Let\u2019s do the Silluntinkara trail, it's an easier 30 km trail, will only take\
  \ 3, maybe 4 hours,\u201D he said. Given this would be an easier trail, we took\
  \ the bare minimum, a few muesli bars and some water. No need for extra layers of\
  \ clothing. Immediately, I started to fall behind. How on earth were they riding\
  \ this? Occasional breaks in the dense foliage revealed steep drops hundreds of\
  \ feet to the valley below. Progress was slow. By 2.30pm a sign showed we\u2019\
  d only done 3 km. Visions of having to spend a night in the jungle started to form.\
  \ Matt, suggested turning back now rather than going on and getting stranded in\
  \ the dark. Mauricio insisted, \u201CNo, bad idea. It\u2019s too steep to push the\
  \ bikes up. The trail will get better. Vamos!\u201D My heart sank. We pushed on,\
  \ aching shoulders from carrying bikes. Frustration and anger clouded my mind. Somewhere\
  \ along the way Matt startled a snake that bit at his leg, thankfully sinking its\
  \ fangs only into his knee pads. Sun light started to fade.\nIn a bizarre encounter,\
  \ we passed 3 ornithologists whilst trying to catch up with Mauricio. \u201CVamos!\u201D\
  \ Mauricio directed us down a long steep chute. We formed a chain and passed the\
  \ bikes down. Dead end! Matt suggested we go back to the ornithologists and ask\
  \ if we could get shelter. \u201CThey don\u2019t want to help us,\u201D Mauricio\
  \ answered. Matt and I decided that we couldn\u2019t continue on in the dark in\
  \ the jungle.\n\u201CVamos!\u201D Mauricio bellowed.\n\u201CWe are staying here!\u201D\
  \ Matt shouted back mutinously. \u201COK! Fine!\u201D Mauricio replied and was gone.\
  \ Silence, except for the river flowing calmly next to us, contrasted with my inner\
  \ turmoil. Disbelief, panic. We\u2019d been abandoned by our guide!\n\u201CWe go\
  \ back to the scientists,\u201D said Matt. Once there, we explained our dilemma.\
  \ The scientists turned out to be gracious hosts and we shared stories with our\
  \ good Samaritans, curiously asking them about what Mauricio had said, that they\
  \ hadn\u2019t wanted to help. \u201CNo, he never spoke to us.\u201D\nAt last dawn\
  \ broke. We thanked our saviours profusely for their kindness. We returned to our\
  \ bikes. As our journey continued, curiosity about how Mauricio had fared was in\
  \ the back of my mind. Had he managed to make it out? Would we make it out?\nAfter\
  \ 4 hours we reached a tiny village. We were out of the jungle! We discovered that\
  \ Mauricio had taken 5 hours longer to complete the trail, almost falling off a\
  \ cliff and taken clean off his bike as his neck caught a vine."
