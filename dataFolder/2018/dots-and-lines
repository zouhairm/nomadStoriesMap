Text: "The hot air of Northern Territory\u2019s dry season whipped across my freckled\
  \ face as I shuffled through the red dusty plains of Arnhem Land, and towards the\
  \ Aboriginal man I could see carefully watching me. \n\nHe was sitting on the ground\
  \ surrounded by earth coloured paints and tiny brushes, with a large wooden instrument\
  \ lying across his legs. As I drew closer I recognised that the instrument was a\
  \ didgeridoo, and the man was using his tiny brushes to paint it with miniature\
  \ dots and lines. \n\nI progressed towards him as I kicked up the terrain between\
  \ my bare toes, a distinct Australian layer of red dust beginning to settle over\
  \ my feet and all the way up my legs. I knew he would not understand my language,\
  \ and in return I would not understand his, so instead we continued to observe each\
  \ other until I found myself down on the ground next to him. \n\nI had not looked\
  \ at someone for such a long time without speaking, but I never once felt a moment\
  \ of discomfort. His hands, which were covered in dried paint, opened as if welcoming\
  \ me to be with him, and his face scrunched up in wrinkles as he smiled at me with\
  \ his eyes.\n\nWe broke eye contact and he went back to slowly painting in dots,\
  \ alternating between the seven earthy tones of paint sprawled out on the ground\
  \ in front of him. I watched him paint and admired his work, but the longer I observed,\
  \ the more I began to understand that this wasn\u2019t about dots and lines at all.\
  \ He gently took my hand and guided it across the top of the didgeridoo, scathing\
  \ the sides of the rough surface and pointing out different painted symbols to show\
  \ me what they meant.\n\nHe did not speak, but he was telling me a story.\n\nI watched\
  \ intently as he traced my fingers over the paintings, maps were coming to life\
  \ and I could see stretches of land, people, and animals all disguised within. The\
  \ dots and lines that initially appeared to be fragments of a simplistic art piece,\
  \ were instead woven together to illustrate the chronicle of this man\u2019s home\
  \ and its people. \n\nThough I would never entirely grasp the history hidden within\
  \ it, I felt fortunate to have been given an insight into the cultural depth of\
  \ his painting, and I nodded in gratitude to the man as I stood up to leave, noticing\
  \ as I did so that there were hundreds more Aboriginal people spread out across\
  \ Arnhem Land. \n\nEach of them had tiny brushes and didgeridoos of their own, and\
  \ as I shuffled my way back to the shelter, I wondered of all the stories they would\
  \ one day tell."
