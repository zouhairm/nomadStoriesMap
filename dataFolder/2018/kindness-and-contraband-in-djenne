Text: "I clenched the rickety motorbike seat as we weaved through the ancient alleys\
  \ of Djenne on our way to a clandestine alcohol seller. This was the last thing\
  \ I had expected when I arrived in town earlier that evening. The previous day,\
  \ a local in Mali\u2019s capital city had advised me against spending New Year's\
  \ Eve  in Djenne, a World Heritage Site with settlements dating back to 200 BC.\
  \ A small and isolated town with deep Islamic roots, he warned, Djenne was conservative\
  \ and would not offer much fun, especially for a young woman traveling alone.\n\n\
  Captivated by images of its historic mud architecture, I went ahead anyway, arriving\
  \ at dusk on the last day of December. \u2018You are alone?\u2019 the guest house\
  \ proprietor asked curiously. I nodded with some wariness, but she checked me in\
  \ without further comment, then offered to get her son Adama to show me to a dinner\
  \ place nearby \u2014 \u2018so you don\u2019t get lost at night.\u2019\n\nAdama,\
  \ laid-back and elegant in a billowing black kaftan, walked me to a small cafe.\
  \ Spicy aromas wafted over the plastic blue tables arranged outside. After waiting\
  \ for me to receive my order of couscous, he said he had to leave for mosque, but\
  \ would be going to a party afterwards \u2014 \u2018do you want to come?\u2019\n\
  \nPleasantly surprised, I accepted the invitation, and sipped through several mint\
  \ teas until he returned from prayers with a few friends. Knowing that alcohol was\
  \ taboo in Djenne, I hesitated when one of them suddenly asked if I drank. But my\
  \ caution soon turned to surprise as they began discussing a plan to get wine for\
  \ me, waving aside my protests that it was not necessary.\n\nWe took a short bike\
  \ ride, bumping along slowly enough to take in the mellow buzz of a community winding\
  \ down for the day, and stopped outside an inconspicuous store. My new friends spoke\
  \ briefly with a brisk elderly man. He disappeared behind the cluttered shelves\
  \ of food and returned with a small bottle wrapped in a black packet, which he handed\
  \ over with happy new year wishes.\n\nAdama tucked the packet into his pocket, and\
  \ we rode on to the party. In a sparsely furnished courtyard, a small but animated\
  \ crowd chatted and danced to an eclectic mix of Malian music and Western pop. I\
  \ barely touched my drink, enjoying the strangely calming energy of a party without\
  \ alcohol. As we chanted through the midnight countdown, I thought of the warning\
  \ I had received about Djenne, and marveled at how easily stereotypes and apprehensions\
  \ dissolve in the warmth of human connection."
