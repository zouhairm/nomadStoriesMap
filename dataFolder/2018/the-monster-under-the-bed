Text: "4 a.m.\nThere I was, staring at the ceiling, lights on. I was tired and sleeping\
  \ would do me good after the 12-hour flight I took from Brazil to England. But I\
  \ just couldn\u2019t. Turning the lights off knowing that I was completely alone\
  \ in that room felt humanly impossible for me. I didn\u2019t know what I was more\
  \ afraid of, the dark or the loneliness, but the key word was exactly that: fear.\n\
  I never feared independence. I craved it, actually. Growing up in an overprotective\
  \ home, I could think of nothing more satisfying than being able to call my own\
  \ shots. For a 15-year-old teenager, spending some time abroad felt like the only\
  \ way to achieve utter freedom. Therefore, I was very sure of my decision when I\
  \ talked to my parents about the opportunity to spend two weeks studying in London\
  \ during the summer. For the next six months I searched for tips on how to organize\
  \ my bags, the \u201Cmust see\u201D places, and what type of clothes I should pack.\
  \ Every time I passed a mirror, I would stop and practice sentences with a British\
  \ accent. Excited didn\u2019t come close to describing me. It never even crossed\
  \ my mind I would have trouble with the most trivial thing: sleeping. It only hit\
  \ me when I was perfectly settled in my dorm at the university; all I could think\
  \ about was my room back at home, which I shared with my little sister. Before her,\
  \ I shared a room with my mom. Never for a day in my life had I slept by myself.\
  \ Now I was alone and scared.\nAs a result, the following days weren\u2019t great.\
  \ The city tours didn\u2019t amuse the sleepy and tired me. I lacked the focus to\
  \ pay attention to conversations and metro rides were the nearest I got to relaxing.\
  \ On the third night, though, the situation changed. There was a flood in my new\
  \ friend\u2019s room. Since no other room was available, she had to crash with someone\
  \ for a few days before it could get fixed. Bingo! Another person in the room. With\
  \ the sleep problem out of the way, I became more open to the things I was experiencing.\
  \ Each time I went to bed, I felt like a different person from the one I was earlier\
  \ that day. I didn\u2019t know how to describe it then, but I know now: I was maturing.\
  \ And the realization only came when my friend announced her room was fixed and\
  \ she would be returning to it. That night I turned off the lights and slept. I\
  \ was no longer scared."
