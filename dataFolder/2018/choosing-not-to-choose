Text: "Sunlight gently warmed the small tent, tugging me from sleep. A strange rustling\
  \ near the tent drew my attention as I crawled out, my gaze darting up to find that\
  \ a herd of alpacas had me surrounded! I shouted in surprise, drawing the attention\
  \ of some nearby locals. A little girl wove through the herd, eventually clearing\
  \ a small path for me to join them. She gestured excitedly to my hair, a disarrayed\
  \ blonde mop of curls that fell around my face. I knelt down and she cooed in excitement\
  \ as she played with it, fascinated. Not many strangers passed through here, after\
  \ all, I thought to myself. Perfect. I had been looking for somewhere no one knew\
  \ who I was, hoping that I could maybe finally figure that out.\n\nAn elderly woman\
  \ wrapped in brightly colored shawls came forward from the group that had gathered.\
  \ She held a small cloth bundle carefully in her arms. Looking me up and down, she\
  \ began speaking. Staring at her bewildered, unable to understand or respond, I\
  \ gestured to the tent, the mountain ahead, and smiled as if to reassure her. Clearly\
  \ not convinced, she was quiet for a moment. Her eyes settled on my uncovered head\
  \ and lit up. Unravelling her cloth, her worn hands revealed a small pile of beautiful\
  \ textiles.\n\nThese textiles are the pride and joy of many of these villagers,\
  \ with few options for creating an income here in the Peruvian Andes.\n\nInspecting\
  \ me thoughtfully, she eventually reached into the pile and pulled out a small brown\
  \ cap with a knitted flower woven onto the left side. Examining the soft little\
  \ item that she had placed in my hands, I debated what to do. I hadn\u2019t purchased\
  \ one yet, I was waiting to find one that stood out, that said \u2018I suit you\
  \ perfectly!\u2019. The woman turned back to her cloth and began packing the others\
  \ away, certain that she had chosen correctly. Without thinking, I fumbled out the\
  \ word \u2018wait\u2019 in Spanish. Looking up at me, she clasped her hands around\
  \ mine and nodded vigorously. Apparently, this was, in fact, \u2018it\u2019.\n\n\
  As I stared at this hat, something in my mind clicked. It was silly to worry about\
  \ all the other options I didn\u2019t get to see. I needed a hat, plain and simple.\
  \ Weighing whether it was the perfect one or not hadn\u2019t gotten me any closer\
  \ to what I actually needed. The woman impatiently tapped me, pointing to my head\
  \ and then to the mountain, insistent that I put it on. So I did.\n\nWith that,\
  \ a grin spread across her face. She was satisfied that I was now properly prepared\
  \ to take on the mountain."
