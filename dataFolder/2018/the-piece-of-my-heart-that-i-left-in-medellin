Text: "A few days before Christmas we are preparing our trip to visit family in Medellin,\
  \ Colombia. This time adding a twist visit. My husband who is active duty United\
  \ States Air Force, myself and our then 6 year old Ali collected over 500lbs of\
  \ gently used clothing, shoes, toys and baby supplies that would meet us there in\
  \ Medellin. \n\nOnce arriving and after much thought we decided Valparaiso, Colombia\
  \ would be the place to share our collected gifts. A small village outside of Medellin\
  \ with a humbleness about it that allows you to quickly fall in love. \n\nMy husbands\
  \ family grew up in the area before moving to the city,  so finding families in\
  \ need came quite easy for us. We began at a local nursing home in town where we\
  \ were treated like local celebrities. Such a warm greeting we received from the\
  \ seniors who more than anything wanted to know more about us and what brought us\
  \ there with bags of clothing. From there we move on to the homes of some of the\
  \ local farmers.Again humble hardworking families who actually gave us even better\
  \ gifts than we had to offer arepas, empanadas, and juice squeezed from oranges\
  \ right in their front yards. The day was going as planned but we had to take a\
  \ break and re-organize and restock the items for Christmas morning deliveries.\
  \ \n\nChristmas morning we are picked up by a farm hand Juan Jose who tells us he\
  \ a has the perfect home for us to visit. We arrive and are greeted by five angelic\
  \ smiles. Three boys and two beautiful girls. As my daughter Ali\u2019s eyes light\
  \ up we hop out of the truck. The mother briefly tell us the story of her deceased\
  \ husband and his murder. She was struggling, not struggling like what I have seen\
  \ but struggling to keep food on the table and milk in their glasses. While I find\
  \ Ali has quickly made two best friends Valentina and Sophia I see nothing more\
  \ than happiness in the eyes of all three of the girls. Despite the language barrier\
  \ Ali is mesmerized by the two girls and is quick to tell me that on that day, Christmas\
  \ Day, it was also Sophia\u2019s 6th birthday. \n\nAlthough it was Christmas Day\
  \ and Sophia\u2019s birthday there was no sign of celebration in the home. We take\
  \ a chance of asking the mother if we could take the three oldest to town for some\
  \ ice cream, she agrees! \n\nWe had an absolute blast in town getting to know the\
  \ girls and celebrating Sophia\u2019s birthday and Christmas in a new way! Long\
  \ story short we now have best friends in Valparaiso and go back to visit every\
  \ single opportunity we get."
