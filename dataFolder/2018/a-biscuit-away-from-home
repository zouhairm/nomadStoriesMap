Text: "Certain smells trigger off vivid emotional memories, taking you back in time\
  \ or place. Some remind you of the places you\u2019ve visited, others \u2013 of\
  \ home. They make you feel connected. \n\nIt\u2019s that deeper level of connection\
  \ I needed when I dropped everything to live in Madrid.\n\nI looked for it in the\
  \ faces of busy Madrile\xF1os, sweltering squares and the bitter aftertaste of caf\xE9\
  \ con leche. I thought I\u2019d find it in the luscious oasis of Retiro. I almost\
  \ felt it in my favourite pieces in Prado. But it wasn\u2019t quite right.\n\nI\
  \ found it in a parallel universe occupied by the cloistered nuns of the Corpus\
  \ Christi monastery.\n\nBraving the stifling heat on the crowded streets of the\
  \ golden city, my head is heavy from the sticky smell of hot asphalt and the nearly-blinding\
  \ reflections from the whitewashed buildings. To escape the human beehive Madrid\
  \ turned into, I quickly cross Plaza del Conde Miranda, and somewhere at the back\
  \ of my head I find a trapped memory surrounding this place. What was it I\u2019\
  ve heard or read about it?\n\nMy eyes turn to the imposing building in front of\
  \ me and I remember \u2013 the biscuits! Behind the walls of the Monastery of Corpus\
  \ Christi is a convent of cloistered nuns who bake. Keeping up a tradition and recipes\
  \ as old as Madrid itself, they sell homemade biscuits to earn a living. Desperate\
  \ to escape the heat and the buzz, and suddenly craving the baked sweets, I follow\
  \ the side street searching for the right door. It\u2019s not obvious, but I find\
  \ it, call in and enter.\n\nIt\u2019s dark and cool, and very quiet \u2013 the noise\
  \ from the outside doesn\u2019t get through the thick bricks. Cloistered nuns make\
  \ every effort to avoid contact with plain mortals and earthly distractions. They\u2019\
  re as focused on keeping still as I am on moving, and I\u2019m grateful for this\
  \ moment of peace. \nI find the rotating table and the biscuit menu. Without wasting\
  \ too many words, I swap coins for cakes. It\u2019s a basic transaction, but right\
  \ here it feels special.\n\nOutside, I find a patch of shade and sit down to open\
  \ my box of sweets. As I bite into the crumbly biscuit, I savour the powder sugar\
  \ dust and smooth almonds. It smells like my grandmother\u2019s kitchen on a Saturday\
  \ evening when she\u2019d bake \u2018something sweet\u2019 for tea. I may be thousands\
  \ of miles from where I grew up, I may not know a soul within this city\u2019s walls,\
  \ I may not speak the language well, but right now, with the nutty aroma filling\
  \ my nostrils, I connect with Madrid and make it home. And all it takes is a cloistered\
  \ biscuit."
