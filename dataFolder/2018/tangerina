Text: "My journey began when a fever dream told me I needed to go to Tangier, filling\
  \ me with an uncontrollable need to speak my mothertongue, Spanish, again. I felt\
  \ a pressing urgency to arrive. Although the allure of the night train to Tangier\
  \ had captivated me, I only had my shoe money after an ATM swallowed my card a day\
  \ before arriving. I spent half my Dirham on a bus ticket and asked the vendor when\
  \ it would leave, he responded \"Soon,\" so I rushed to catch a seat. \nThe woman\
  \ before me was crying, we didn\u2019t understand each other I settled on a universally\
  \ curative phrase I knew she\u2019d understand. \u201CChocolate?\u201D she nodded\
  \ so I walked to the candy stand. I bought every sweet in sight, yet I'd spent only\
  \ $4. The act liberated me from the ascetic lifestyle I had led until now. I treated\
  \ myself to a 1Dh cookie and was hooked. After 5 hours of practically evaporating\
  \ from the suffocating humid air, my appetite kicked in. I disembarked the bus and\
  \ asked the driver when we left \"5 minutes, we're leaving right now.\" I sprinted\
  \ to buy a sandwich and made it just in time.\nIt's important to say: I get lost.\
  \ To say on occasion would be an insult to sailors, simple wrong turns, and well-intentioned\
  \ map makers. This has never stopped me, in fact, I often find an improvement on\
  \ my way to my set plans. Fear of getting lost stops people from encountering things\
  \ they hadn't expected to find. Upon arrival in Tangier I happened upon a tiny corner\
  \ stand, tucked behind a sheet. A small happy man came out to show me the way, his\
  \ intricate directions joined by a chorus of input. The crepe vendor to he: \"No,\
  \ no, it's faster to go right, then around!\" I didn't care: I had found my cookie\
  \ vendor. I came here every day after. \nGiving directions in Morocco is not simply\
  \ a passtime, it\u2019s a way of life. A collaborative, full bodied effort, and\
  \ a point of pride. Leaving my hostel, I'd pass the same man every day, who kindly\
  \ accepted my first rebuff of goods the first time.\"That's good. Stay healthy!\"\
  \ Each morning, on my way to town, I'd pass the same man on the same corner. He'd\
  \ smile and remind me, \"This way, Miss,\" his face beaming. There was something\
  \ to love and admire even in the hash dealers of the city. \nOn my last day in Tangier,\
  \ I approached the cookie man's stand. He raised his arms up to the sky, his face\
  \ lighting up. Seeing me again he grabbed the small, familiar package, placing it\
  \ in my hand. He said \"Ya no eres turista, eres Tangerina!\" You are no longer\
  \ a tourist, you are a citizen of Tangier."
