Text: "For everyone at some point in their lives, comes an understanding that life\
  \ isn\u2019t the way it was imagined 5-10 years ago. The puzzle maybe the same,\
  \ but the image is constantly changed. For me, this realization moment knocked on\
  \ my door on one December evening, the day before my trip to Wien.\nI opened the\
  \ door, and it was the friend that I would be traveling with for the holidays. He\
  \ informed me that he was not going on the trip that we had planned a month in advance.\
  \ No worries, a solo-trip is the best way to challenge yourself, right?. (Despite\
  \ the last minute hiccup, he is a very intelligent man.)\n\nAfter the trip, I understood\
  \ how lucky I was to go on this trip alone. I met up with him to share my pictures\
  \ and stories from my travels. One conversation that I prominently remember was\
  \ about a day I spent in Wien. I was walking around center, and I decided to go\
  \ to the art museum. To get to which, I had walked through this park. It was a beautiful\
  \ day as the sun rays pierced through the trees, and the pathways hidden under a\
  \ blanket of shadows casted by the tree canopies. I am periodically checking my\
  \ Google map to ensure that I am not lost. Although, letting yourself be lost is\
  \ the best way to explore, find, and open new experiences. However, I have a friend\
  \ who worked as a cognoscente and claimed that the Rubens exhibition was one of\
  \ the best that year. Finally, I arrived on the round square where two twin buildings\
  \ where facing each other: one was the art museum and the other was the natural\
  \ museum. I followed my map, and it took me to the Museum of Natural History. I\
  \ bought a ticket, went inside, and suddenly I was surrounded by a group of 10-years\
  \ old. They had come here to explore thousands and thousands of different kinds\
  \ of stones. I imagined the horror depicted in each muscle of my face. I admit,\
  \ that museum was one of the best experiences I have ever had. Not many institutions\
  \ can boast of having real samples from the moon, asteroids, as well as a full-scale\
  \ model of a moving dinosaur.\n\nMy incomplete companion interjected, \u201CHow\
  \ could you spend a whole day on wasting your time in the park and in the children\u2019\
  s museum?\u201D \n\nLittle did he know, that the hotel room we booked in advanced\
  \ had a window in the bathroom wall right in between the toilet and the bed. \n\n\
  What can I say, I enjoyed each and every moment of my trip."
