Text: "BEWARE OF MONKEY MENACE reads the rectangular blue sign with white lettering\
  \ at the base of the Badami Caves. I stand with my back to the hot sun, chuckling.\
  \ Since the moment I stepped off the plane onto Indian soil, nothing has been expected.\
  \ My senses have been flooded with new experiences. The streets are vibrant with\
  \ colorful saris, flowers in the hair, intense smells of curries and car exhausts,\
  \ and the constant movement of people ringing in my ears. Even the dirt has an incredible\
  \ red hue that I can\u2019t say I have ever seen anywhere. Whether walking through\
  \ a local market or down a crowded street, it is as if, the sub-continent of India\
  \ soaked up the most vibrant parts of life from the surrounding sea and land, leaving\
  \ the rest of the world, bland. As I walk around the complex, an example of 6th\
  \ century Indian rock-cut architecture, situated on the west bank of manmade lake\
  \ between two rocky hills, I am transported into another time. The caves, carved\
  \ out of the red sandstone hillside at the base of a ravine, consist of four temples.\
  \ The magic of India can be seen within the spirituality of its people, and these\
  \ exemplify India\u2019s rich religious diversity. The first cave is devoted to\
  \ Shiva, the two middle caves are dedicated to Vishnu, and the fourth is a Jain\
  \ temple all connected with stone steps. Lost in my thoughts of a long lost dynasty,\
  \ I find myself stopping dead in the middle of the trail. A small monkey is standing\
  \ directly in the middle of the path and I am unsure how to proceed when I feel\
  \ a sharp tug of a bangle on my left wrist. I look down to see another monkey running\
  \ away from me. Once safely nestled in his tree hide-out, he waves at me, my bangle\
  \ in his hand. In utter disbelief, I stand shell-shocked, when I hear my guide \u201C\
  I\u2019m so sorry. They like sparkly things.\u201D His eyes were full of sorrow.\
  \ Looking at the monkey still staring from his tree, I just smile. In that moment,\
  \ I was grateful. Growing up poor, I put a lot stock in possessions. However, witnessing\
  \ the beautiful chaos of India and what poverty outside of the United States looks\
  \ like, I realized the value of experiences. India is a country full of frenzied\
  \ cities, luxurious palaces, colossal temples, and vibrant people. In a land where\
  \ ancient structures are intertwined within the fabric of bustling modern life,\
  \ it can be easy to get lost in all the happenings. But, when you least expect it,\
  \ you may have things put in perspective and you might learn something about yourself."
