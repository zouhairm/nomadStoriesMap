Text: "I\u2019m dying. This is it. This is where I will meet my demise; on this hill\
  \ that feels as if it were inclining at a 90-degree angle. \u201CJust leave me here.\
  \ I won\u2019t make it,\u201D I semi-jokingly said to my friends about half-way\
  \ up. I kept getting told what was waiting for me at the top of the hill would be\
  \ worth the climb so I decided to suck it up and keep going. I was not disappointed.\
  \ \nI have always heard people talking about the Italian Riviera but just assumed\
  \ it was not within my travel budget. I mean the name alone exudes elegance, and\
  \ for some reason I always pictured a stoutly man wearing a monocle and carrying\
  \ a cane when I thought about it.\nHowever, when I did a little research and started\
  \ asking some of the locals, I was surprised to learn that a short train ride away\
  \ sat the Cinque Terre (pronounced cheenk-we tear-ah) villages that make up part\
  \ of the Riviera coast. I was told that all five villages could be done in one day\
  \ since it was only a five-minute ride between each, but if I really wanted to explore,\
  \ I should pick just a couple. \nThe village chosen, Manarola, was one of the most\
  \ famous for its breathtaking views and friendly locale. It was made a UNESCO World\
  \ Heritage Site in 1997, and upon arriving it wasn\u2019t hard to see why. \nWhere\
  \ I expected to see fancy five-star hotels and world-class dining was an older,\
  \ picturesque village made up of towering, brightly-colored buildings surrounding\
  \ you on all sides. The village itself was built into the side of a rocky outcrop\
  \ that looked as if one swift wind would send them crashing into the bay below;\
  \ yet was still begging to be explored. \nThe best view can be seen from a very\
  \ steep hill to the right of the bay that leads to the hauntingly beautiful local\
  \ cemetery. It combines such a sense of balance between the end of life and the\
  \ beauty of life, that you can\u2019t help but sit in silence as you take it all\
  \ in.\nThe magnificent pink and yellow buildings stand out perfectly from their\
  \ rocky surroundings and are complimented greatly by the crystal-clear blue waters\
  \ in the bay just below them. Even the small details like the pristine white row\
  \ boats that line the coast and colorful umbrellas from the local cafes seem to\
  \ create a world almost too good to be true.\nManarola may have been here for hundreds\
  \ of years but with the lack of attention it gets compared to its neighbors, it\
  \ makes it feel as if you\u2019ve stumbled onto a secret place no one else knows\
  \ about. Like you have your own secret gem of the Riviera."
