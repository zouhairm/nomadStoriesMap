  at your\u202F feet.   \n \nGanga Stotram,Sri  Adi Shankaracharya (8th CenturyC.\
  \ E.)   \n\nPatitodhwarini (uplifter of the fallen ones), Sureswari (Goddess of\
  \ God\u2019s), Naraka-Nivaarinni\u202F(Saver of all passion of hell ), Moksha Dayini\
  \ ( liberator of birth cycle), are few of the names by which River Ganga (Ganges\
  \ ) is regarded, in our ancient scriptures. Like every great civilization, our civilization\
  \ also flourished on river banks. Being the largest river flowing entirely inside\
  \ the nation with her hundreds of tributaries and contributories Ganges is considered\
  \ the most important giving birth to numerous myths, stories and folklore.   \n\n\
  In the Puranas (Indian mythology) many stories are told to us about Ma Gange. From\
  \ her birth in a cosmic hole created by Lord Vishnu to her descent to earth to liberate\
  \ the 60000 cursed souls who unknowingly insulted great sage Kapil and many more.\
  \ Various historians have tried to decipher those coded stories to rebuild ancient\
  \ history.  \n\nI have felt her motherly affection and was urged to travel along\
  \ her course to the source Gowmukh in Gangotri glacier. I did complete my journey;\
  \ move from the mouth to her source, covering three  important places  in mythology\
  \ - her estuary at the Bay of Bengal on Makar Sankranti  Mela (fair),Prayag ( the\
  \ confluence of  Ganga,Yamuna and the mythical underground river Saraswati ) in\
  \ great Kumbha Mela held once in 12 years and finally Goumukh where Goddess Ganga\
  \ descended from heaven to be tamed by Lord Shiva in his tresses and allowed to\
  \ gently come down to earth along with  Varanasi  ,  Haridwar and Hrishikesh . \n\
  \nThose journeys gave me a glimpse of our great civilization and rich culture. There\
  \ are thousands of sects with their varied beliefs and philosophy from all corners\
  \ of India; yet they converge under one single umbrella called Sanatana Dharma \u2013\
  \ the Hindu way of life. My numerous encounters with them, listening to their stories\
  \ on the banks of this great river and witnessing her almighty strength humbled\
  \ me and I bowed to her greatness.  She is the Nectar of Immortality of our civilization.\
  \ This is just the prelude to that story."
