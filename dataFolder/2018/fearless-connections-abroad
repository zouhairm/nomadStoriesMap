Text: "Sounds of motors and horns flooded the densely populated streets of Ho Chi\
  \ Minh City, the business and financial hub of Vietnam. Motorbikes were the majority\
  \ of the vehicles and impressively flowed together like a school of fish. When one\
  \ moved, the rest would sense it and follow or turn ever so slightly so as not to\
  \ crash. \n\nJust across the busy road was the Central Park of Saigon. There, dance\
  \ music could be heard motivating a crowd of people in what appeared to be a massive\
  \ outdoor Zumba class. Old and young mostly women danced in unison following the\
  \ moves of the leader who was at the front.  The energy in the city was buzzing,\
  \ and so was I from all the commotion. I hurried across the dangerous traffic towards\
  \ the park. My heart was racing from the adrenaline rush of making it to the other\
  \ side.\n\nLike an obvious Millennial tourist, I took my phone out to video the\
  \ scene for my Instagram story. Just as I was putting away my phone, a young Vietnamese\
  \ boy wearing glasses and holding a large book bag approached me asking if I spoke\
  \ English. His accent was thick, but I could understand him. \n\nThough he looked\
  \ friendly, my fear-based American upbringing kicked in warning me not to talk to\
  \ strangers. Quickly I shook the silly antiquated idea out of my head and responded\
  \ with a friendly smile saying, \"Yes, I do.\"\n\nThe boy grinned back at me, then\
  \ politely asked in broken English, \"You practice, with me?\"  \n\nI thought about\
  \ my plans for the day that consisted of more lonely sightseeing and graciously\
  \ decided to entertain his request. \n\nThe boy and I stood there in the park getting\
  \ to know each other in basic English. A few moments later another young Vietnamese\
  \ girl asked if she could join us. They didn't know each other, but both had the\
  \ same goal to advance their English speaking skills. To my surprise, two more young\
  \ students approached us a few moments later. At first, I struggled to keep up with\
  \ the conversation. They were all so eager to practice that they would practically\
  \ cut each other off.  \n\nI was astonished by the drive and determination they\
  \ had to learn and their ability to approach a stranger displayed a fearlessness\
  \ I admired greatly.  I felt fortunate for the opportunity to connect in such a\
  \ meaningful way with them and to be able to give something back to this beautiful\
  \ country I was visiting. \n\nAfter all, a significant purpose of my solo-adventure\
  \ was to push through my fears and connect with others outside of my privileged\
  \ American bubble."
