Text: "The last thing I expected when I boarded my plane to Bristol, England for graduate\
  \ school was learning to accept one of the largest accomplishments of my life can\
  \ from what I thought was my biggest failure. \nI sold off everything, basically\
  \ except for my cat, before I left Arizona. Arizona hadn\u2019t felt like home to\
  \ me in years. My progression was hindered. I remain more confident than fearful\
  \ in taking the leap with my decisions. I had multiple paths but arrived in Bristol\
  \ in the hopes of earning a Master\u2019s degree in Comparative Literatures and\
  \ Cultures within in one year. I yearned for new beauty! I was met head on with\
  \ a program that felt completely rigid compared to coming from a university known\
  \ for being number one in innovation. There were endless struggles making me feel\
  \ I couldn\u2019t progress- made me question what type of writer I was. This was\
  \ a side of Nichelle I had not known. Writing essay after essay made my gut sink\
  \ deeper month after month. I had many friends, I went out to concerts, I was an\
  \ athlete, and a life model. Nothing made me feel wholly better. The main problem\
  \ was fighting between university standards and who Nichelle was. Where was the\
  \ happy-medium? I looked at myself in the mirror for months thinking I was a failure.\
  \ I felt my world crashing. Extreme sickness and a torn knee occurring simultaneously\
  \ with this essay dilemma shook me. My mind felt different- thoughts were raging\
  \ on in ways I couldn\u2019t understand. It was exhaustion times 10! I constantly\
  \ worked against multifarious disadvantages in life in order to take part in such\
  \ special opportunities living overseas. So much sacrifice was made to make it this\
  \ far. How was I to get around this obstacle of feeling like I had tried everything\
  \ and more already? Defeat tried to swallow me but I refuse to ever give up in life\
  \ and lose my smile. My pride was getting the best of me. I grew up knowing I must\
  \ always find new winding paths to reach all my goals. I finally walked away for\
  \ the better. I realized it was another learning experience. These trials and tribulations\
  \ lead to a meaningful triumph. These struggles are what we learn from the most.\
  \ I learned how to accept taking a step back, refreshing my mind, and looking for\
  \ another path instead of hammering my head against a wall. THAT realization is\
  \ one of my greatest accomplishments. One can never prepare for everything in life.\
  \ The last thing I expected was to find beauty in the struggles I endured while\
  \ living in England."
