Text: 'Woking again and again each and everyday  for the better tomorrow is one of
  the greatest thrust of human being.we all are dreaming many a days and assuming
  ourself either in the peace land or in the war land.the main difference between
  these two dreams are depending upon  your daily life,daily adventure ,jobs and many
  one.

  There are two types of persons here,one are those who are deemed to there daily
  life,routine, cycle and they are just passing there time in fulfilling all the needs
  of their families. And they are thinking that they all are accomplished with several
  life achievements,but the truth is that ,they are bored with there life,just passing
  on..

  We should have the thrust of travelling, exploring, knowing the many of the countries,
  places there life styles,wearing sense, not only from my country, many of the countries
  persons will know about the peace land and the heaven of earth,there are the several
  places where  one should spend a lot of time by watching the scenic beauty the amusing
  beauty of earth land paradise,where the long distances are covered by grasslands,
  where the earth crust is covered by oceans ,mountains, streams,hot water,cold water,
  snow,snowfalls,and a many lot.if i have given the time of watching this beauty whole
  a day ,i will explore it express it in many lines .many pages,and the people will
  know about ,what is this earth,what we want from our self,the whole attacks or the
  whole scenic beauty in which one can easily get lost,life is not about giving up,life
  is about the thrust of knowing several changes and nature.

  From my view those persons are very much optimistic beacuse they are having the
  vast interest in exploring the nature.those are really fortunate because they are
  born in the golden green  nature,hot streams,lakes,oceans,mountains ,hills,and snowfalls.,the
  reason behind this title ''paradise through retina'' is not a single 3 words title
  ,where as these are the thrust of a traveller like me,who always want to live the
  golden opportunity of watching and feeling these all things in an another country,

  After hearing only ,one can write  lot about a place,so think that ,if that person
  will able to view all these golden panorama''s from his or her retina,he will give
  them a living structure,

  Several lines never describes any place ,the thrust of travelling and exploring
  can.

  Many of people will know the place,and will create a peacefull world,where there
  is only lots of love affection and care for every opposite persons.


  That''s the life.'
