Text: "I rarely expect anything from a trip because I feel like I never know enough\
  \ about it to assume whatever can come out of it. Although, there is one thing that\
  \ makes me choose a place - that is for me the best method I could ever find - and\
  \ it rarely leaves me unsatisfied: the comparing of places to settings that I have\
  \ seen or appreciated in a movie; because everything in them feels just so outstanding.\
  \ I am a Movie lover and, as such, I always wish to see some of them as reality.\n\
  I do play a little game in my head when I choose a place to visit: I tell myself\
  \ 'will that make me inclined to think I am someone else for a moment?' You may\
  \ believe as a silly and immature game, but really it has made me see unbelievable\
  \ things, because it transports you into that lively bubble that movies can represent\
  \ sometimes.\n\nEarlier this year, I took on a splendid trip to Peru for about three\
  \ weeks. And, like many countries, this one reveals something about itself. When\
  \ you think about it, mostly your thought revolves around cliches (mountains, lamas,\
  \ warm people with funny hats, spicy food but not so much, and so on,...). So, that,\
  \ right there, is the cliche material, obviously. \nBut, as I said, I didn't expect\
  \ much before going because you only feel this euphoria that absorbs all of your\
  \ energy - whether it is good or bad- before going on such a trip. \n\nI do remember\
  \ several things from Peru but I am only going to underline one: the Humantay Lake.\n\
  It was nearly the end of our trip but none of us wanted to keep the awful final\
  \ memory that was stuck with us at the moment (because of previous unexpected fails\
  \ too). High of its 4200 meters, this lake is truly a representation of a superior\
  \ entity, whatever that means. Climbing to get there is no picnic, with all its\
  \ mud and slippery roads, it took ages to get there.\n\nAlthough, it appears my\
  \ yearning for playing a glamorous part in a glamorous movie set was almost fulfilled.\
  \ We had to experience a cavalcade running in our direction, while there was no\
  \ way of moving backwards! Sometimes, it literally felt like we needed to jump on\
  \ some side of a mud hole not to die really!\nBut boy, once you surpass all of this,\
  \ you wish you had never seen any of it, because you'd have to leave it then! Its\
  \ multicolored water, shaped with the reflection of a gleaming snowy mountain looking\
  \ at you and smiling with the sun, along with our faces... That was the last thing\
  \ I expected from my trip to Peru and, it was genuinely gorgeous..."
