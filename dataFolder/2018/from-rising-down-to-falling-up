Text: "While the bus of stately proportions was running over the last 34 hours, the\
  \ only thing I could entertain myself with was shifting gaze from the endless highway\
  \ to the detective series to our driver\u2019s liking. Having passed rows of traditional\
  \ farmhouses and wind turbines smothered in the fields of rape, doors of the bus\
  \ finally opened and I found myself right at the railway station. I heard somebody\
  \ whisper: \u201CRaise your head.\u201D I looked up: down from the top, a ginormous\
  \ building was sweeping its examining eyes over me. I was so enchanted with its\
  \ look that everything in-between and around us ceased existing. In the city where\
  \ I knew nobody its main resident was the first to welcome me with open arms. As\
  \ far as I remember I\u2019ve always longed for reaching the top of society. Somehow\
  \ living in a ritzy mansion, I felt so enormously jealous looking through the windows\
  \ at the ordinary people. I was standing by the fireplace while they were hurrying\
  \ outside on a cold rainy day. They had their hands free and could walk wherever\
  \ they wanted while I was holding the baby from dawn to dusk. My arms became home\
  \ for other\u2019s child while the walls of their mansion became my prison. The\
  \ hosting family seemed to be never satisfied: they said I cost them too much yet\
  \ they felt no ease. Instead of helping with the baby 30 hours a week I was always\
  \ at their disposal. While other young people from my Au-Pair agency waited forward\
  \ to the weekends to enjoy life, I had nothing to wait for. My rights were infringed\
  \ yet giving up seemed to be disgrace I couldn\u2019t outlive. It would never end\
  \ until the end of the contract no matter how many times I was to get over myself.\
  \ Working without a single day-off last five weeks became a kind of the last straw.\
  \ I realized I didn\u2019t help the family. Instead of it I inadvertently pandered\
  \ to the human rights violation. I wish I could witness baby\u2019s first steps\
  \ and words. But not to be another brick in the wall of hierarchy structure where\
  \ their own children were indulged and the rest of human beings \u2013 treated the\
  \ way I was, I decided to leave. Looking straight into the squinty eyes of my hosting\
  \ father I said: \u201CI quit\u201D. Those two words became the key which closed\
  \ one door and opened me the way to freedom. It was the first time when I preferred\
  \ giving up to fighting. Instead of feeling like a loser I spread my wings and rose\
  \ like a free bird I used to be. With a huge suitcase in my hands, I went back where\
  \ I felt at home \u2013 to the Cologne Cathedral."
