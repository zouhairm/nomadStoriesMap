Text: "It was a Sunday in County Clare, Ireland. About twenty American students, including\
  \ myself, heaved out of an 'Lucky Charms' green bus. \n\nWe were at the Cliffs of\
  \ Moher, and it was storming. And I was in shorts. \n\nMy classmates began trudging\
  \ up the muddy slopes to heading towards the Cliff\u2019s edge. I watched their\
  \ feet sink in the mud, almost as if the dirt purposely climbed higher. All of the\
  \ visitors were falling, fumbling for someone\u2019s arm elbow to clutch. I stood\
  \ with my back to the visitor\u2019s center observing. \n\nI have vertigo. Even\
  \ though I loved to hike and see the bird\u2019s-eye-view on a mountaintop, there\u2019\
  s always a moment of doubt that breaks the very fabric of that glorious view. I\u2019\
  m quickly sedated by the gravity I feel sitting on my back as I look down, even\
  \ from a small distance of just a of couple feet. \n\nSo I watched as groups of\
  \ tourists struggle like ants up a muddy hill battering the coastal winds and summer\
  \ rain. Some of the tourists formed circles at the base of the cliff near the Visitor\u2019\
  s Center, working up the hillside in rotating circular movements.\n\nI wondered\
  \ how these people could allow their eyes to miss a second of the splendor of the\
  \ cliffs. It was a harsh view and certainly not the picture-perfect Instagram moment\
  \ many no doubt had prayed for, but a beautiful view none the less.\n\nThe swollen\
  \ skies drifted between shades of angry and sleepy grays while the sea bathed the\
  \ fronts of the Cliffs with stormy blue hues. The Cliffs withstood the blows and\
  \ waved their shaggy grasses back to the wind. It made the gusts against my back\
  \ feel like gentle caresses. \n\nI turned to go inside the center when a friend\
  \ grabbed my hand and started walking us up the hill. \n\n\u201CDon\u2019t be ridiculous,\u201D\
  \ he said. \n\nI dragged my feet, but with almost two feet in height difference\
  \ I succumbed to matching his dominating stride. We were walking up the hill. Hand-in-hand\
  \ wading through the sea of grasses that looked so serene from the visitor\u2019\
  s center and now appeared sharp and menacing. \n\n\u201CI think I\u2019m going to\
  \ be sick,\u201D I whispered.\n\nHe squeezed my hand. I squeezed back and pushed\
  \ on.\n\nI kept my eyes directly on my feet, noting the stark contrast my white\
  \ legs made with the dragging black ponchos my compatriots wore around me. We took\
  \ a small turn to the right and suddenly my feet were on the knobby edge of the\
  \ earth.\n\n\u201CLook up,\u201D he said. \n\nWhen I did, I was breathless. It was\
  \ glorious."
