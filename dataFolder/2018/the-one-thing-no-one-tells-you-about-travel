Text: "When I stepped off the airplane and onto the soil belonging to a cold and drizzly\
  \ Berlin recently, I felt a mixture of things. Anticipation. Fear. Excitement. Regret.\
  \ Optimistic.\n\nI wasn\u2019t supposed to be on this trip alone. I\u2019d booked\
  \ the last minute deal for my on-again-off-again boyfriend at the time, hoping the\
  \ ability to explore somewhat foreign lands would help him him fall in love with\
  \ travel the way that I did and kickstart the recovery of his depression. But at\
  \ the last minute, he changed his mind.\n\nFacing Berlin alone was not something\
  \ I had wanted, nor was it something I was looking forward to. But, travel is always\
  \ an opportunity that is hard to say no to - alone or otherwise.\n\nWhilst there,\
  \ I discovered a new thrill of dining alone in quirky restaurants. The Dungeons\
  \ were particularly fun - gruesome history is kinda my thing - and one of my favourite\
  \ experiences was stocking up on snacks and hopping on a sightseeing bus tour. Whilst\
  \ it rained outside, I snacked away, warm and content, listening to Berlin\u2019\
  s history.\n\nAt Topographie des Terrors, I had a reality check and realized that\
  \ though my heart hurt and though I was sad over a boy, my problems were nothing\
  \ compared to the horrors that had gone on throughout Germany\u2019s history. My\
  \ situation and my feelings seemed almost laughable in comparison.\n\nMy realisation\
  \ that maybe with time I would be okay came the evening I arrived at Museum Island\
  \ and gazed in awe at Berliner Dom. With the sun just beginning to set and creating\
  \ the most stunning backdrop for such a beautiful building, I realized that getting\
  \ here wasn\u2019t so easy, but it had resulted in a moment of clarity and content.\
  \ I took in the astonishing view and knew deep down that he could not take that\
  \ away from me.\n\nBut as I let myself into an empty hotel room at the end of each\
  \ day, I did not expect to feel such a strong pang of loneliness. The sharp but\
  \ dull ache I felt in that moment made me realize that there are some things people\
  \ don\u2019t tell you about travel.\n\nTravel opens your eyes to new cultures, new\
  \ experiences and memories to last a lifetime. It\u2019s one of the best things\
  \ anyone can do in the short lives we have. But it can get lonely too, especially\
  \ when you\u2019re faced with an empty hotel room for an entire evening in a foreign\
  \ country, not quite knowing what to do with yourself. I know now how to take precautions\
  \ to avoid feeling this way. \n\nI knew I\u2019d feel a lot of things during my\
  \ visit to Berlin. The last thing I expected was to feel loneliness."
