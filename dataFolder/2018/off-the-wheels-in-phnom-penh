Text: "It wasn\u2019t the best way to meet the parents. Covered in blood, broken nose,\
  \ fractured skull and glass stuck in my arm. Good thing her Dad was a doctor.\n\
  I\u2019d met Devy on Christmas Eve 2008 after taking advice to, at least once when\
  \ in Phnom Penh, visit The Heart of Darkness. I recruited an Israeli & an American\
  \ girl who was keen on him & absconded to Cambodia\u2019s most infamous club.\n\
  I saw her as soon as I cleared security.\nStunning & staring at me.\nInvoking ANZUS,\
  \ I sent my American to enquire the purpose of her interest. This wasn\u2019t my\
  \ first time in the jungle. I knew the risks.\nThe report was positive, she was\
  \ drinking real drinks.\nDevy drove me to my lodgings that night & many more. I\
  \ drove once to prove I could.\nBy day I did the tourist thing & she picked me up\
  \ when she finished work.\nThen she quit her job. We could spend days together.\
  \ Or weeks.\nDitching her car, we jumped on a bus to Siam Reap so I could wander\
  \ around the temples of Angkor. Aside from one irritable tuk-tuk driver & having\
  \ to move hotels after being kicked out for returning too late, we enjoyed ourselves.\n\
  We convinced the Israeli that two men slow dancing is OK, tagged the Angkor What?\
  \ Bar with a Canadian I\u2019d met in Laos & renewed old alliances with a Kiwi to\
  \ see off a Japanese guy who thought Devy was for sale.\nAll in all, we\u2019d had\
  \ our fun, but my visa was running out.\nWe returned to Phnom Penh for a week before\
  \ I dashed to Hanoi.\nTwo days before I left, Devy took me out for dinner. After\
  \ a month of mockery for wearing a seatbelt, I didn\u2019t buckle up.\nHitting the\
  \ concrete traffic divider is a memory of three frames.\nDevy was awake but shaken.\
  \ The car was upturned & my window smashed. Lifting myself over the shards I turned\
  \ to help Devy but was pushed away by the gathering throng.\nShe emerged; shins\
  \ bleeding from crawling over glass.\nOne phone call & her family was inbound. A\
  \ quick exam by her old man & into a car, not to medical care, just the police station.\
  \ Fines are promptly paid in Cambodia.\nUS$2000 later we were off to hospital where\
  \ Devy\u2019s father truly proved his clout. We bypassed ER to radiology. The staff\
  \ weren\u2019t happy with my lack of paperwork until he made a call. Without knowing\
  \ what was happening I was ushered inside to be scanned.\nUpon my exit we had been\
  \ joined by another elderly Khmer. Devy helpfully identified him as the chief doctor,\
  \ her father\u2019s old friend.\nNo brain bleeding or bruising & no fee for treatment.\
  \ Goes to show, no matter where you are, it\u2019s not what, but who you know."
