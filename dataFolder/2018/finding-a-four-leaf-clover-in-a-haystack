Text: "There\u2019s always been something about the Shamrock that intrigues me. Maybe\
  \ it was my Mom\u2019s collection of pressed four-leaf clovers gathered by my late\
  \ Grandpa and the way she spoke of his \u201Cgift\u201D for finding them everywhere\
  \ he went. Whatever the reason, I\u2019ve always wondered: is the \u201Cluck of\
  \ the Irish\u201D a real thing? And Is finding a four-leaf clover actually as hard\
  \ as finding a needle in a haystack? \n\nIn 2014, with my family and my World Map\
  \ printed spinner luggage set in tow, I headed off to Ireland in search of answers\
  \ (and of course, my lucky charms). \n\nMy appreciation for the Shamrock is paralleled\
  \ only by my appreciation for an Irish folk duo called Hudson Taylor that I discovered\
  \ on YouTube in 2011. As fate would have it, they would be playing at the Sea Sessions\
  \ surf festival the day after we arrived in Dublin. As a super-fan, you can imagine\
  \ my excitement at finally being able to see these talented musicians perform live,\
  \ and also my disappointment at discovering (after purchasing tickets) that Bundoran\
  \ is on the opposite side of the country. We scrambled to rearrange accommodations\
  \ and rent a car and 4 hours later arrived in Bundoran ready to explore the quaint\
  \ Irish surf town. \n\nThe next morning, after a good night\u2019s sleep, we decided\
  \ to start the day with a traditional Irish breakfast. I was chipper as can be,\
  \ as I was about to see my favourite band play live in less than 12 hours. Half\
  \ an hour into our eggs, mushrooms, grilled tomatoes, and beans I interrupted a\
  \ joke about black pudding to say that I thought I had seen Alfie Hudson-Taylor\
  \ walk by. As I went to take another bite of my eggs, I dropped my fork and stated\
  \ with complete confidence that Harry Hudson-Taylor had just walked by the restaurant.\
  \ The next thing I knew, I had chased my mother out of the restaurant and down the\
  \ street and was face to face with my favourite artists.\n\nI\u2019ll spare you\
  \ the details, but all you really need to know is that I got so nervous that I defaulted\
  \ to the weather as a topic of conversation. I did get a great photo op and few\
  \ winks from the stage when they saw me in the front row later that afternoon. \
  \ I wasn\u2019t nearly as charming as I would have liked to be, but to be fair,\
  \ it\u2019s pretty difficult to prepare for a conversation you never expected to\
  \ have. \n\nI still have no idea how hard it is to find a four-leaf clover, but\
  \ I bet the odds are comparable to finding your favourite band walking past your\
  \ breakfast place. \n\nFinal verdict: the \"luck of the Irish\" is definitely a\
  \ real thing."
