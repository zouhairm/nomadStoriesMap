Text: "I was always trying to tidy my life up, but often inspiration comes from the\
  \ unexpected moments, when our plans collapse. Nowadays I know it is at this point\
  \ when magic happens. In my case, 11.000 miles far from my home. \n\nFour months\
  \ ago, I arrived alone to a surfer town as a backpacker. I decided to take a break\
  \ from the busy and polluted city where I used to live. It was so hard but I knew\
  \ I was in my comfort zone and I was not as happy as I could be. The most easterly\
  \ mainland point in Australia, Byron Bay, was my choice. This small town is well-known\
  \ for having an alternative lifestyle, a high concentration of free-spirited and\
  \ creative people and an organic, ethical and plantbased food culture. \xA1It was\
  \ like a dream! As soon as I arrived, I bought an a\xE7ai bowl and I sat down on\
  \ the grass to enjoy a live music concert. On the following day, I started a Yoga\
  \ and Meditation Retreat. I can still remember, like it was yesterday, how this\
  \ combination gave me goosebumps. I soon understood why this spot has just suddenly\
  \ caught on. It was love at first sight and I was quickly surprised myself calling\
  \ the town home. I felt I had always been there.\n\nA lot of people arrive every\
  \ year to this hidden gem in their roadtrip, gap year or vital journey looking for\
  \ changing their lives. Byron Bay spreads good vibes from the beginning. The Welcome\
  \ to Byron sign clearly shows this with its message: Cheer up, slow down and chill\
  \ out. And it is not only an advertising slogan. Wherever you go, you can see suntan\
  \ and smiling surfers walking barefoot and living in an endless summer or young\
  \ couples making healthy grocery shopping with their wood baskets full of avocados\
  \ or free range eggs.  Out of the blue you suddenly realize you want to be one of\
  \ them. And then something inside your mind changes. Byron Bay brings you a strong\
  \ feeling of freedom thanks to its way of living. \n\nDuring my time here, I have\
  \ met people who think Byron Bay is a paradise but others compare it with La La\
  \ Land film set, where living a beautiful but sweetened australian dream is possible.\
  \ Nevertheless, everybody, both locals and tourists, accord being happy in Byron\
  \ Bay is easy. There everything flows. \n\nThat is how I found my place on earth.\
  \ Byron Bay made me feel everything is possible. Now I am awake. I was asleep before.\
  \ I am sure that everybody have their own Byron Bay somewhere in this world. Sometimes\
  \ it appears just when you need it. This is the magic of Byron."
