Text: "From the first view the Khakranagla village was no different from other places\
  \ in Rajasthan. I was greeted by heat, clay houses and loads of colours.\n Few women\
  \ were washing their beautiful sarees, others were sitting on the floor and cutting\
  \ vegetables for lunch or making little fire to fry chapati. The kids were running\
  \ naked or half naked and playing with broken bricks. \nBut this was no ordinary\
  \ village. There were no middle aged or older men here, just young boys who looked\
  \ at me with the big wonder in their eyes. They pretended to have some matters to\
  \ attend closer to me and watched every step I took. \nThe village was mainly inhabited\
  \ by women of all ages from young to elderly and they all belong to Bedia caste.\
  \ For few hundred years they been working as prostitutes and it goes from generation\
  \ to generation. They can not get other jobs or be accepted to any schools or universities.\
  \ They must dedicate they life to sell themselves to men. You would think it is\
  \ a modern world and places like that only existed ages ago but is happening and\
  \ nobody really wants to change that. \nI met Lata, young women with long dark hair\
  \ and the most beautiful smile. She was playing with her 2 months old daughter and\
  \ looked both happy and peaceful at the same time.  Lata works in Dubai as prostitute\
  \ but had to go home to give birth. The father is a \u2018\u2019special client\u2019\
  \u2019 who was a regular and paid her more money for having sex without protection.\
  \ She told me all kids in the village are born like that. Even though NGOS started\
  \ to encourage women to use female condoms and donated boxes of them, the ladies\
  \ found hard to accept the importance of using these strange things and most of\
  \ them had chosen to give themselves to the hands of fate.\nLata was even proud\
  \ of what she does. In Dubai the money is better, and she can support her family\
  \ back home. She even had a TV and a mobile phone.  The young woman shared that\
  \ many high range people come to the village including military generals and politicians.\
  \ The prices are very different, but the top one is paid for the virgin girl -14000\
  \ rupees. As older you get as less money you earn, but you never retire. \nI had\
  \ a mixture of emotions coming to me. I looked at Lata and her new born daughter\
  \ who in 13 or 14 years will have to continue the family tradition and most likely\
  \ sell her virginity for top dollar to a wealthy and powerful Indian men. \n I am\
  \ still struggling to accept it and I am not sure I ever will."
