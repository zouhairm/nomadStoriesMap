Text: "It was in 2014; I had the determination to learn Spanish.  In one year I traveled\
  \ Spain from North to South, and there I ultimately fell in love with the language.\
  \ \nMy love of Spanish brought me to Argentina. Argentina's massive, vertical landscape\
  \ promised adventure and scenery overdose, fast forward, it delivered all 200% of\
  \ my expectations. \nI started my journey with a 26-hour flight from Kazakhstan,\
  \ but when I landed in Buenos Aires, right away, I understood that I came home.\
  \ Later I understood why. \nI took Spanish lessons during the day and at night,\
  \ me and my schoolmates explored the city: danced in authentic tango bars, ate delicious\
  \ food and met ridiculously friendly people. \nI booked Spanish classes throughout\
  \ the country: Buenos Aires, Bariloche, Mar Del Plata and Iguazu. This way, I kept\
  \ meeting like-minded people and explored the country. I met students who volunteered\
  \ and helped local communities, also I met those who learned winemaking business.\
  \ We came from different parts of the world but yet we were so similar in our aspiration\
  \ to get to know this country better. However, the country was incomprehensible\
  \ in a single visit. You may start your journey up in the north in humid and yet\
  \ spectacular Iguazu falls and end your trip down south together with penguins in\
  \ the Arctics. In between these extremes, there is my favorite part: Patagonia.\
  \ I decided to take a bus and partially cycle throughout this plain. Argentinian\
  \ Patagonia is mainly a steppe-like terrain. While passing this endless land I felt\
  \ like being back home: a vast land proudly stretching and majestically showing\
  \ off its scale. I felt that I am just a small molecule cycling there with no real\
  \ chance of overcoming that distance.  I even thought that I pushed myself too hard\
  \ and overestimated myself. However mile by mile I felt stronger and yet humble\
  \ to be able to leave my footprints in this land and I wished that Patagonia remembers\
  \ me as I remember it now. \nArgentina without any flattering was the best country\
  \ I have ever visited.  Although, I did not reach the southern edge of the world\
  \ that time and this was the perfect excuse to come back"
