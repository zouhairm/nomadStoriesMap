Text: "\u201CHola, que tal?\u201D, our russet eyed cab driver, R\xFAben, chimed with\
  \ a glowing smile as we hopped into his humble taxi. Christmas day in Cusco was\
  \ a vibrant blend of popping fireworks and laughter on an otherwise normal day in\
  \ the storied Incan capitol. We clunked over the cobblestone streets of the city\
  \ center before slowly winding and ascending our way up above the bustle and hum\
  \ below. \n\nPassing ancient ruins and picnicking families playing f\xFAtbol alongside\
  \ imported Eucalyptus groves, Ruben slowed the car as we came upon several horses.\
  \ He rolled down the passenger window and asked the guide at the rear of the group\
  \ if he might be able to help us fulfill our sought adventure of a horseback ride.\
  \ The young man was happy to oblige and quickly bounded downhill and out of sight.\
  \ \n\nWe chatted with R\xFAben as we waited for our escort to return. Emily, with\
  \ her flawless Spanish and inquisitive nature opened the conversation while my attempt\
  \ and eagerness to speak the local language got smiles and laughs from them both.\
  \ R\xFAben himself had not learned Spanish until he moved to the city in his early\
  \ teens. Growing up in a remote Quechua village in the Andes he told us with regal\
  \ yet solemn eyes that his hometown was \u201CPara\xEDso,\u201D paradise, and  \u201C\
  we didn\u2019t have much but we had all that we could need: good pasture, dark soil\
  \ and cool, clean water.\u201D\n\nEmily and I listened intently imagining a more\
  \ simple life free from the cobwebs and entrapments of \u2018modern\u2019 life.\
  \ \u201CQue maravilloso!\u201D she exclaimed, envisioning what it would have been\
  \ like waking each morning setting out barefoot into the fields of multi-colored\
  \ maize. \u201CIt was wonderful.\u201D R\xFAben said his eyes and gaze now sinking\
  \ slightly. \u201CUntil the mine showed up\u2026\u201D     \n\nOur horses emerged\
  \ from the wooded hillside before he could finish the story. He tossed me a cellphone\
  \ and instructed us on how to get ahold of him when we were ready to be picked up.\
  \ We didn\u2019t know it at the time but R\xFAben would become a good friend over\
  \ the next week, happily sharing his knowledge of the many wonders to be found in\
  \ a land his ancestors had roamed for untold generations.  \n\nWe trotted uphill\
  \ and asked our guide the names of our steady steeds as the cab bounced away down\
  \ the soft dirt road. \u201CApache and Wayra,\u201D he told us. Wayra.  Quechua\
  \ for wind.  An apt title for a noble creature. We rode on the back of a breeze\
  \ as I wondered what this place might be if left free from the conquest, change\
  \ and modernization that had molded its current state."
