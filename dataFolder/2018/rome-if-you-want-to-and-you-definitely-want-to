Text: "\u2018Rome is so\u2026 basic. You only need to spend, like, a half day there.\
  \ Everybody knows that when you go to Italy, you go to Florence.\u2019\n\nThat was\
  \ the advice I received when I told anyone that I was going to Rome. I was excited\
  \ about the trip but the entirety of my social network told me that I shouldn\u2019\
  t be. So, despite my best inclinations otherwise, I started looking in to other\
  \ Italian cities in which to spend my time. Goodness knows that I didn\u2019t want\
  \ to be basic. If I was going to go to Italy, by God, I was going to do it right.\n\
  \nSo I researched how to fit Rome into a day or two. I knew better than to try to\
  \ cram The Eternal City into one day. The eternal city is forever. That\u2019s worth,\
  \ at least, a couple of days. The internet led me to a perfect, handsome, spacious\
  \ apartment. \n\nI was ready.\n\nI arrived in Rome, jet-lagged but excited & made\
  \ my way to the flat. When I arrived, a man named Giuseppe was in the apartment.\
  \ He wasn\u2019t my host. He explained that my host was away on holiday & that he\
  \ (Giuseppe) was handling the check-in. During our chit-chat, he found out this\
  \ was my first time in Rome & I found out he was a chef\u2026 who was about to open\
  \ a restaurant\u2026 in a 1000+ year-old structure. He also found out that I\u2019\
  d never been on a scooter or had proper Roman pizza. I thanked him for checking\
  \ me in & pulled my sight-seeing notepad out of my messenger bag. He asked what\
  \ that was. I told him. He laughed. He asked what I wanted to see & I began to rattle\
  \ off this site & that. He laughed again. He told me to meet him downstairs in 20\
  \ minutes.\n\nOkay\u2026 ?\n\nA strange man in a foreign country just told me to\
  \ meet him & I was about to do so. I went downstairs & found him on his scooter,\
  \ holding a helmet. He told me that he was going to show me Rome. Not processing\
  \ the sheer insanity of what he said, I went with it\u2026 and fell in love with\
  \ Rome. In an afternoon that found me eating pizza by the scissor-ful, walking through\
  \ orange groves, gazing at the city through keyholes, and weaving in & out of traffic\
  \ on a small, motorized vehicle, I realized that I wasn\u2019t going to be heading\
  \ to Florence. \n\nInstead, day trips to Pigneto found me eating ice cream and photographing\
  \ street art. Wandering Centro Storico led to an all-night pasta, wine, sandwiches,\
  \ and dessert extravaganza with a mother-daughter pair of chefs. I walked with models\
  \ in Prati. I lived the Rome of my dreams by forgetting to think before I acted\u2026\
  \ which led me to remember exactly what I wanted in the first place."
