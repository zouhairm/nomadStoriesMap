Text: "My most weird or unusual experience which I encountered on the foreign turf,\
  \ no doubt the clear winner was the fine dining experience I had summer this year\
  \ in the Nice City (France)\n\nThe plan was going perfectly well until the last\
  \ night of our stay. We were invited to a fine dining experience which we misread\
  \ as a special dinner. It was a funny yet awkward situation when we see our self-wearing\
  \ casuals shorts and crocs among the well suited and sophisticated gentlemen and\
  \ the lovely ladies in the gowns. \nWe were caught a little off guard but we try\
  \ to blend in by settling down a table in the corner. We were soon approached by\
  \ the manager who politely requested us to consider coming back in a semi-casual\
  \ dress, but being the last day of the trip we had nothing left in our closet. He\
  \ offered us a same fine dining experience in a different restaurant. We were relieved\
  \ and pleased to accept the offer to avoid any further awkwardness.\nBefore I start\
  \ digging into food, let me share one secret that I was vegetarian for almost my\
  \ entire life until last two years where I started with the taste of chicken. It's\
  \ very common for Indians to live a vegetarian life. I did not get used to eating\
  \ any other meat than chicken.\nI almost fainted when the chef started the show\
  \ with the Duck Liver to being with. I had really hard time trying chewing it for\
  \ first few seconds before swallowing it with a glass full of wine.\n\nI could hardly\
  \ recover from the first surprise, the moment later he throws another bomb us by\
  \ serving us with a dish of Rabbit Legs. I could imagine all the cute rabbits I\
  \ played with them when I was a child. I never ever imagined french dinner will\
  \ bring such an emotional touch to our dinner table.\n\nTrying to move on after\
  \ the first two disasters, the third one was waiting around the corner for us when\
  \ I saw an Octopus leg on my plate. Yes, it has the tentacles which I imagined struck\
  \ on my face like a suction cups. I decided to give up by choosing other dishes\
  \ which has normal creatures like Fish and baby mushrooms.\nAs the movie is not\
  \ complete unless it's a happy ending, I was thrilled to see the desserts which\
  \ look like a piece of art. It's hard to describe but in short, I can say it looks\
  \ like a lemon ball with a pungent taste biting on your taste buds with a chilled\
  \ sense brought by liquid nitrogen. The specialty in desserts is French chef's forte\
  \ as I could eat all the Macaroons, Pastries and cookies like a 5-years old child."
