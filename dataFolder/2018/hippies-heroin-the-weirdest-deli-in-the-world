Text: "Have you ever been to Boulder, Colorado? Hippies, a thousand bike shops, and\
  \ super crafty beer fill the land.   \n\nToday I decided to check out the town.\
  \ \n\nI wandered up Pearl Street which is the main drag. As I passed a couple of\
  \ older gents I heard one say \u201CI had to snort heroin just to come down\u201D\
  .  \n\nWhoa...\n\nNext, I wandered into a small deli that looked like a medieval\
  \ forest filled with hobbits and fresh bread. I took a seat in an odd nook a few\
  \ steps above the kitchen area. It was like my own little tree house.\n\nA moment\
  \ later, a kind young gal asked if I had ever tried mate. I said no and she whipped\
  \ up five samples of various house made mates. Peach, mango, green, black, outer\
  \ space, who knows.\n\nThe green one was my favorite. It tasted like butter beans\
  \ and topsoil.\n\nShe wandered off as a fella with harry potter glasses took her\
  \ place. He asked if I wanted a mate.\n\n\u201CWell, I just tried a few\u2026\u201D\
  \ I replied as he handed over a full glass of green mate.\n\n\u201COn the house\u201D\
  \ he smiled.\n\nWow. Thanks!\n\nMy new friend filled me in on the deli concept.\
  \ He explained there are these little delis all over the world and the entire staff\
  \ lives together at each location in a commune. \n\nHe said most join the communes\
  \ because of hard times. Lost souls looking for a helping hand. They stay free and\
  \ work at the deli until they can get back on their feet. \n\nA few moments later,\
  \ a homeless man entered the restaurant demanding free food. The staff politely\
  \ escorted him out as he shouted profanities of which I had never heard in my life.\
  \ Fascinating but sad at the same time. \n\nAfter I finished my salad my server\
  \ asked if I wanted dessert. I was about to ask what they had when he placed a full\
  \ banana, coconut, organic milkshake in front of me.\n\n\u201COn the house\u201D\
  \n\nWow. Thank!. \n\nI finished the shake and was paying the bill when I heard\u2026\
  \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s your name?\u201D\n\nI turned to find a short, rabbi looking\
  \ guy with an odd native American headband staring at me. \"Trey\", I replied...\
  \ \n\nHe then asked, \u201Chave you ever had a chai latte with hemp milk\u201D?\n\
  \n\"No\"\n\n\u201CHere, take this one with you, it\u2019s on the house\u201D\n\n\
  As I was leaving, I realized I have never met a nicer, more amazing restaurant staff\
  \ in my life. They really seemed to love each other, their job and their customers.\
  \ I loved the fact their whole mission is simply about caring for people. Their\
  \ customers and their own. \n\nI passed the homeless guy outside as I left and gave\
  \ him the chai Latte.\n\nTrey"
