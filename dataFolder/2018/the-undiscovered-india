Text: "....And finally I'm at the airport after a long journey hmmm.... so! Time to\
  \ search for a placee yay!! As I'm in India let's leave like an local Indian that\
  \ is I will eat Indian local food, stay at a normal place oh BTW I'm in Ahmdabad.\
  \ Well I decided this place coz for last few years many presendents came to India\
  \ and visited it so here we go... well back to where i will be living its a house\
  \ in local area and we will be taking a bus fiest and then by auto. Auto I can't\
  \ wait to travel in that it will be my first time!!  So exited...!!!\nLet me tell\
  \ you you should definitely try it ones (auto ride) well they got lots of autos.\
  \ Well about the place where I am staying is homily even the owner is a nice person\
  \ it felt life i'm talking with a friend oh and even told about few places to visit.\n\
  well it's afternoon so I m first going to visit sabarmati ashram yes you heard it\
  \ right  well almost  everyone knows gandhiji so let's start our journey from there\
  \ and get some history of it...\nWell this ashram was started by gandhiji he selected\
  \ this place as it was situated between a jail and a crematorium as he believed\
  \ a satyagrahi has to go rather if the place. Gandhi said \"This is the right place\
  \ for our activities to carry on the search fortruth\_and develop fearlessness,\
  \ for on one side are the iron bolts of the foreigners, and on the other the thunderbolts\
  \ of Mother Nature.\" The dandi March was started from here its March for the law\
  \ made by britisher for salt on 12 March 1930. Gandhi even vowed that he would not\
  \ come back until India gets its freedom.\nWell that's a history for now buy it\
  \ definitely have a long one I gave a short. You need more free time to spend as\
  \ its a nice place near nature \nNow I am going to university road well you must\
  \ be thinking why at university at this time when you should be having dinner. Well\
  \ we are going there to have dinner you thought about right thing street food. About\
  \ this place there's probably no history. During night students come here to eat\
  \ there are many kinds of cuisine available and they definitely smell great. That's\
  \ not the only thing you get here there are even cloth stalls for both different\
  \ types of things shirts n styes and many more and are cheap I think the types of\
  \ cloths the collage students wear you can find all the college students here and\
  \ a better place if you want to take a survey for college students. It's not the\
  \ only night market they got many another place is near sardar Patel stadium it's\
  \ much bigger"
