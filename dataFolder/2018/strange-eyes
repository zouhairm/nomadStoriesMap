Text: "The distant rumbling brought my sleepy head off my mother\u2019s shoulder.\
  \ After a month in Europe my ears were trained to the approaching metro, today\u2019\
  s transportation being the ever-crowded Metro de Paris. Despite my quiet Midwestern\
  \ upbringing, I had embraced this foreign land with its strange cuisine and funny\
  \ languages. Before my parents could blink I was sprinting through hordes of Trafalgar\
  \ Square pigeons, excitedly greeting caf\xE9 patrons along the Rue Neuve and volunteering\
  \ for street performances in the Piazza Navona. \n\nAs the metro jerked along the\
  \ track, I heard the metallic screech of an opening door and felt a rush of hot\
  \ air caress my face. Despite the crowd, I caught sight of the small figure entering\
  \ the car. Peering through passengers\u2019 legs, I watched as she deliberately\
  \ made her way through the car, eyes downcast, hand outstretched, looking like a\
  \ ragged ballerina performing a perfectly choreographed dance to a silent song.\
  \ She was so like me; slight frame, brown hair, freckles splashed across her six\
  \ or seven-year-old face. As her steady dance neared she found my small Converse-clad\
  \ feet and glanced up. Our eyes locked. A breath caught in my throat choking off\
  \ the eager greeting on my lips. \n\nI stared into her strange eyes for what felt\
  \ like hours, trying to puzzle out what I saw in that level gaze. How could a face\
  \ be nearly my own yet have eyes I couldn\u2019t begin to comprehend? Consumed by\
  \ confusion, I startled when my mother\u2019s hand gripped my shoulder. I glanced\
  \ up at her reassuring face; a face I looked to for everything a six-year-old could\
  \ ever need. Looking back into those strange eyes a shred of realization bubbled\
  \ into my brain and flowed down through my chest, squeezing my heart so tightly\
  \ it threatened to shatter. \n\nA coin was pressed into my hand. I blinked away\
  \ unbidden tears as the girl lifted her tiny, dirt-lined palm. Gazing into those\
  \ eyes I begged mine to say what I knew my mouth couldn\u2019t. A whisper of a smile\
  \ floated across her face. Beaming back, I willed every trace of joy in my small\
  \ body to be hers, knowing it was all I could offer. She would never see the effect\
  \ this moment in time would have on me; that I could never forget this glimpse into\
  \ a life that had chosen her and spared me for reasons unknown.\n\nWithout another\
  \ glance she disappeared to the sound of a metallic screech, leaving me with the\
  \ caress of hot air on my face and something new lodged in my heart that I couldn\u2019\
  t yet understand but would never lose."
