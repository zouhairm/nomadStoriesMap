Text: "Undulating sand dunes below me, galaxy of stars above me, cool breeze surrounding\
  \ me, and I lay the footprints, as I trek in the Khoori desert of Jaisalmer. Suddenly,\
  \ a tiny but bright star followed a semi-parabolic trajectory, caught my unshakable\
  \ attention, and I hardly blinked my eyes for a few seconds; something magical I\
  \ saw for the first time in life.\n\nI heard the noise of ghoongroos (jewelry that\
  \ women wear on ankles while dancing) approaching towards me. It was a group of\
  \ four; three men and a woman. The men were dressed in green wearing white dhotis\
  \ and colorful turbans. The woman was in a typical traditional attire wearing multicolored\
  \ ornaments made of beads, stones and crystals: her eyes- a perfect reflection of\
  \ unblemished pearls.\n\n\u201Ckhamma-ghani!\u201D, I greeted.\n\n\u201CNamaste!\u201D\
  , the woman replied.\n\n\u201CYou know Hindi!\u201D, I exclaimed.\n\n\u201CYes,\
  \ and we know six other different languages\u201D.\n\n\u201CWhy you learnt those\
  \ languages?\u201D, I questioned.\n\n\u201CSo that we can communicate with tourists\
  \ in their language. We have to do this to earn a living. He is my husband. We both\
  \ run a juice shop in the Jaisalmer Fort, and these two are my brothers who are\
  \ camel drivers. We\u2019re not much educated but our health is our greatest asset\u201D\
  , she explained.\n\n(After a few moments of silence)\n\n\u201CYou look exquisite\u201D\
  , I complimented. The man looked at her, smiled, and shook his head. It instantly\
  \ revealed their compatible relationship; that too, they both loved each other.\n\
  \n\u201CThanks! jewelry that a woman wear is the identity of any culture\u201D.\n\
  \n\u201CWhy are you carrying this wooden stick?\u201D, she asked.\n\n\u201COh! This\
  \ is my companion flute. I carry it to every place, I visit. It makes me feel secure\
  \ and confident\u201D.\n\n\u201CWould you like to merge the sound of your flute\
  \ with other musical instruments they play, while I perform?\u201D, she asked, pointing\
  \ towards a decorated ground.\n\n It hit all the chords of my heart; I agreed instantly.\
  \ \n\nAfter an hour of wonderful evening, I asked the woman to allow me to leave.\
  \ She bent on her knees with one touching the ground and other acting as a pedestal.\
  \ I took a step back but she insisted me to go on. She took my leg one by one on\
  \ her right knee, and tied her \u201Cghoongroos\u201D on my ankles. \n\n\u201CThe\
  \ sound of your flute added silver lining to our performance\u201D. \n\nI hugged\
  \ her tightly and said to myself- \u201CThis is the greatest reverence, I ever received\
  \ from anyone\u201D.\n\nWe all have an in-built universal compass of compassion\
  \ in our souls, which always points towards the good."
