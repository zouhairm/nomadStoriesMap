Text: "There we were, rolling in the dirt of Black Rock City, Nevada. Even the name\
  \ conjured those same feelings of riding my ten-speed, aged nine, down the notorious\
  \ Nelson road, in small town, Gympie. Full speed ahead, my BMX gang in cahoots,\
  \ hoping to make time, with front teeth intact. Except there were no hills here,\
  \ rather a vast, flat, demon\u2019s land, where pale fourty year olds have to do\
  \ just that, let go and free fall. An ornamental bicycle, being the only form of\
  \ transport across the hot stretch. \n\nWe peddled through the dust as colourful\
  \ onlookers yelled, \u2018welcome home\u2019. I knew I would have to get into the\
  \ spirit of the desert and fast. I felt far from home and dormant butterflies began\
  \ to scatter through me. Smiling faces of strangers became familiar. Hugs from bronzed,\
  \ good looking Germans, on illuminated, concave paths, made me begin to feel a belonging.\
  \ This was what I needed. Even if it was just a week. Arid through the day and alive\
  \ with rainbow, glittery lights and love by night.  \n\nRiding through the dust\
  \ storm of day two, I reflected on the decision to fly across the world. My wife\
  \ and I had one week to decide whether we would forgive or forget\u2026US. We were\
  \ burnt out and the daily rut was overwhelming. We were tired of the circular conversation\
  \ and finally an ultimatum would put a stop to it. Just like heading into the dust\
  \ storm, we had no idea where we were going. \n\nCuban soul music, soft at first,\
  \ became louder. Spellbound, we followed the art car through the desert. Soon the\
  \ dust in my teeth didn\u2019t bother me. Twenty years ago, dance music had brought\
  \ the two of us together. Blindly, we shadowed the sound, and all though I couldn\u2019\
  t see it, I knew she would be smiling. We peddled in time.\n\nSymbiosis would be\
  \ the theme. At night, we would dance and drink others sweat, embracing others with\
  \ vigour and familiarity. By day, we spoke deeply about life and love in giant,\
  \ man- made sculptures. The place charged through me. Free from small talk, I could\
  \ show affection without caution. I was home and had forgotten the reason for the\
  \ holiday.\n\nThe last night we gathered around the \u2018Burning Man.\u2019 We\
  \ had tirelessly read all the offerings left by feeling wanderers. Elegies of love\
  \ lost and heavy ache; we wrote our own. Never reading aloud. The flames engulfed\
  \ the statue and our words. Seventy thousand stood silently, watching the sparks\
  \ fly. I watched and cried.  I understood what the desert had to teach. The desert\
  \ wasn\u2019t home, she was."
