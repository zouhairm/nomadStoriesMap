Text: "It was before i was about to leave for a trip with my two friends who were\
  \ ready to explire with me . It started at my grandmother's place where i disputed\
  \ with my elder brother then imbecause of the fight i was kind of injured and thought\
  \ that i have the money and courage and i can do it , i wanted to go out on a trip\
  \ till i am healed so i told my mom that i am going with them but its shifted early\
  \ and now the story goes , \nIt was not easy to travel alone at any moment at begenning\
  \ . So i prepared every emergency thing which can be last to use to survive . *MyTripToKheerganga\n\
  I went to gurudwara near kasol village and there i felt peace and safety leaving\
  \ home and coming to dangerous mountains . I stayed for a day and then i took the\
  \ bus to Barsaini which is last bus stop of the road and its pretty high for the\
  \ starting point of trek . \nThere i started a small trek and reached to  Kalga\
  \ Village  , It was new for me and so i booked a room for a day and i thought because\
  \ it was common hall of gurudwara at Manikaran , nakear Kasol Village i might be\
  \ able to charge my phone there 'but' there was no electricity from last month and\
  \ only hope was sunlight at day and torch with batteries at night. I wasn't scared\
  \ but lonely and that loneliness made me stay the whole day . \nThen next morning\
  \ i planned to go to kheerganga trek and as i had already covered 1/30th of it i\
  \ thought i can make it . \nHours went by but i didn't get any chance to go out\
  \ of that comfirtable peace , the sun , the trees , the oxygen and the delight of\
  \ being there. So i just created a room like hkme there and put my clithes in the\
  \ closet set for each day . \nI was happily reading novels and touring with my smaller\
  \ phone with buttons and listening music with guitar jammers nearby . \nIt was so\
  \ good that i was loving every sense of it. Thats why then i started to think about\
  \ my life and how to make it better and why the conflict occoured and i was there.\
  \ \nAt peace when you sit and start thinking , your body leaves your soul and it\
  \ goes around in the field to walk where your eyes can see and that was it . It\
  \ was going to home . It was saying to forgive and let go and be happy once again\
  \ with the relation given by god not me.\nSo i travelled back and said sorry and\
  \ it won't happen again and this time i made a promise to be the guy who was wiser\
  \ than me and who was managing the living up there. \nThere i found what i was seeking.\
  \ My courage and my will to see behind the unknown and unpleasants."
