Text: "Legend has it that Char Bagh or \u2018the park of life\u2019 in heaven was\
  \ recreated on earth by Brahma to preserve every element of the human race and maintain\
  \ harmony on earth. \nWhile many are aware of familiar ones, namely Humayun\u2019\
  s Tomb, Taj Mahal, and Ram Bagh, few know about the Char Bagh at the British Council,\
  \ Connaught Place, the perfect amalgamation of modernity infused with the classical-\
  \ a pleasing blend of aesthetics, style, and minimalism. \n\nMy experience: \n\n\
  \u201CWith a waft of aroma numbing your body and heightening your senses and pulling\
  \ you away from the hustle- bustle of a scheduled life, you are instinctively pulled\
  \ towards the Char Bagh. As you take a tour of this fresh take on Eden, the audacious\
  \ pigeons that are perched on the ledge joining the goliath pillars break your spell.\
  \ It seems they aren\u2019t pleased with this intrusion of their territory and are\
  \ reporting your crime to the towering giants. \n\nSome young readers murmur and\
  \ nibble snacks in two of the Baghs while others argue over the curriculum in the\
  \ other. A curious wind ruffles the pages, yet no one is perturbed, such is the\
  \ effect of this place. One Bagh is ruled by its queen- a stone statue of a female\u2019\
  s face, symbolizing the fives senses. A water bodyguards the queen as she holds\
  \ fortress and surveying her empire. \n\nThe core of this universe is an illusionary\
  \ fountain right in the center of the garden. Holding gravity and symbolizing virtue,\
  \ focus, and composure. Water gently cascades over the surface, a silent harmony\
  \ as if an orchestra is being composed in the distance and the notes are reaching\
  \ you as whispers. \n\nThe palms in the corner soil beds, giggle with pleasure,\
  \ roused by the mischief of the summer breeze. \n\nAs I sit there, soaking in the\
  \ autumn sun, nestled in this paradise, a winged intruder, lured by the fallen crumbs\
  \ spilled around me, breaks my solitude. It looks at me as if saying that it pardons\
  \ me for my trespassing and wants nothing but peace if in reciprocity I generously\
  \ share a part of my snack with it. I smile and spill some more crumbs and my companion\
  \ shrugs and settles down next to me. \nSurrounded by a comforting silence, two\
  \ visitors shed of all inhibitions and worry and let the magic of Char Bagh, awe\
  \ us. \n\nI felt complete in that moment as if I was standing at the precise border\
  \ of yesterday and tomorrow, and I just felt so complete. I believe that is the\
  \ charm of Char Bagh, it stops time or simply transports you.\u201D"
