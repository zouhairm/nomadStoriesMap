Text: "Inishmore Island received record rainfalls the night prior. The hike to the\
  \ top of Dun Aonghasa Fort now involved wading through knee-deep water. While others\
  \ refused, I slipped off my shoes and socks. I tiptoed into the mud until I was\
  \ submerged into the pool of stagnant water. I tried to move quickly, but the muddy\
  \ water clung to me. I slowed down my pace and focused on strides. \n\nI made it\
  \ to the end of the pool and sat on the wet ground to place my socks and shoes back\
  \ on my feet. Groups of people hung back on the other side of the pond, too afraid\
  \ to get muddy. I stammered to my feet and trekked through the muddy, rocky terrain.\
  \ Further ahead, green pastures engulfed the land. I stumbled twice up the steep\
  \ incline, but the blue sky, green grass, and cattle cheered me on. I saw the stone\
  \ structure up ahead with people climbing through the narrow opening. One foot moved\
  \ in front of the other faster and faster up the steep incline. I crept through\
  \ the opening in the stone and stood dumbfounded by the three-hundred foot drop\
  \ that looked out into the endless blue waters.\n\nI found a new thinking rock at\
  \ the cliff\u2019s edge. I was never one for bucket-lists; I never understood why\
  \ only in the face of death people became motivated to follow their dreams and passions.\
  \ Nearly five months prior, however, I found myself falling into another bout of\
  \ depression. A feeling that began to consume my life more often than not. I contemplated\
  \ suicide every day. There was one thing though; I couldn\u2019t die without seeing\
  \ Ireland. I wanted to know what home felt like. Maybe it was due to lack of experiencing\
  \ a family structure, or maybe it was because I never fitted in growing up. Either\
  \ way, I lacked a feeling in Allentown, Pennsylvania that I gained at the top of\
  \ the fort. The breeze caressed my shoulders and kissed my cheeks. The sun beamed\
  \ down illuminating the white crests of the crashing waves far below. Now, I sat\
  \ at my rock at the cliff\u2019s edge in paralysis. The cliff was a large, open\
  \ flat space. I looked out until the rocky cliff\u2019s end merged with the horizon.\
  \ There was no security from the edge or protection from vulnerability, yet there\
  \ was a feeling of safety that held me in place. The island helped me with a lot\
  \ of reflecting, and Ireland reminded me that home may not consist of a family,\
  \ or be where you lay your head down to sleep every night, but it is a feeling of\
  \ connection that can be found in every corner of the world."
