Text: "\"Caroline, we're not hungry now.\" It's difficult to explain to a Senegalese\
  \ woman, on a plane to Italy, that on our airplanes you have to get hungry at that\
  \ precise moment. Not a minute later, even if his son is cardiopathic and risks\
  \ dying at any moment on this journey for hope. \"Mum speaks only wolof, the child\
  \ is called Ousmane and has the tetralogy of Fallot. It should be operated as early\
  \ as possible in Italy\" this I heard from a Spanish volunteer while I drank my\
  \ Italian coffee at the home of volunteers from an orphanage in Mbour, after two\
  \ weeks spent changing diapers. It was July 2015. After all these little orphans,\
  \ there was a normal child to be saved. A child who had a mother, a stubborn seller\
  \ of shea butter in Dakar. In January 2016 I'm back in Senegal to take mom and son\
  \ and accompany them to Italy. In the Embassy, \u200B\u200Bthe woman looks at a\
  \ map. She asks me where is Senegal and where is Italy in a broken French, while\
  \ a woman took care of their visa for medical expatration. The baby coughs. I pray\
  \ that he will not die there and not before arriving at the hospital in Italy. He's\
  \ so beautiful, and her mother terrified, in all her extreme dignity. The day to\
  \ leave is here. At the airport I whisper \"dress, in Italy there is snow\" and\
  \ I wear heavy clothes .. No. In Africa no, not there. Perhaps by plane, where only\
  \ part of the \"Senegalese self\" of this family will ascend. Who knows. Fathou\
  \ leaves me Ousmane and go to pray his God. We wait our fly. Ousmane is sick, resists,\
  \ does not cry, dreams of a bicycle when he arrives in Italy. Bear it, but only\
  \ for his fucking bicycle. \"Caroline, how can I know tonight if I need something\
  \ to eat? How can I know now to buy it now? Why there are no people on the street?\
  \ Why do you have all the broken horns? Why throw all those things away?\" ... I\
  \ have not had any answers yet. \"Caroline, I thought in the hospital that Ousmane\
  \ was dead, and I tell you to remember that God is great.\" An African child in\
  \ Italy teaches you that \"in Italy there is a lot to eat even in toys\", that the\
  \ bicycle.. You can accept it but only if you can share it with other children once\
  \ at home. An African child laughs, laughs even with a gash on his chest and while\
  \ he is waking up from anesthesia. An African child does not know how to discard\
  \ a gift and two years later, in his Senegal, on a terrace drowned by the dusty\
  \ wind.. he asks you to go to school. And he does it with those deep black eyes\
  \ that pierce your soul."
