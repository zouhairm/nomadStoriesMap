Text: "Hello everyone, I'm Federico and I'm 26 years old - already too many - and\
  \ I NEED to travel. Last year, I went to Cuba, in May, and that experience was exiciting.\
  \ Havana with his Malecon end fantastic Hystoric centre, Case particular allowed\
  \ me to know a lot of strange but funny people but above all the fantastic nature\
  \ (I left a piece of my heart in Vinales). This experience, open my mind, and enticed\
  \ me to try new experience and travel, travel and travel. Ops,I almost forgot, our\
  \ guide, known in Havana, PEDRO. Pedro, is the perfect example and incarnation of\
  \ Cuban's spirit. He has only one problem, sorry two: eat and sleep (and when dosen't\
  \ drive, drink). With Him, we had some trouble, some drawback, about one each hour,\
  \ but this was part of our trip.\nI learned to appreciate, Cuban's spirit (it does\
  \ not take much to love their natural heritages), despite their conditions that\
  \ a European would hold to the poverty line, they live thei life \"Suave\". \nI've\
  \ a dream, find a job that allow me to turn around the world, to documentate how\
  \ many fantastic peolple, live in the Earth.\nI think, that nowadays, too many television\
  \ news and newspapers, do phycological terrorism, it's true that there are much\
  \ disaster caused by man, but I think also that 80% of population have good soul.\n\
  But I want to prove it, with people stories, around the world, people with a different\
  \ culture than mine, people who have passed different storier than mine, people\
  \ that think oterwhise than me.\nI want to export, my thoughts but learn some from\
  \ \"strangers\", I want to learn something from a different nature of Italy, how\
  \ it lived industrialization, world of work, opinion, mores.\nI'm lucky to have\
  \ been born in Italy, because, we've some beatiful places and a vast mix of culture,\
  \ in a relatively small territory, we have a fantastic history of our origins but\
  \ that unfortunately you cannot breathe anymore.\nI hope to realize, my dreams,\
  \ my desire to travel, visit places and meet people that can change me for the better,\
  \ even if it meant staying away from my affections.\nReturning to the Cuban experience,\
  \ the best feeling I felt, was when during a storm I saw children playing football,\
  \ without problems, with a big smile, I'm back baby too.\nTheir rudimental market\
  \ and shop are very original, and create that direct relationship between people.\n\
  I've not shared, some point of views, about their culture, expecially about love,\
  \ relationship between married couple.\nEven if I don't win, I'm happy to have shared\
  \ something.\nFederico"
