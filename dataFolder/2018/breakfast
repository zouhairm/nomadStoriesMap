Text: "Still blurry eyed I grunted at my room mate to take the lift alone, I\u2019\
  d take the stairs. I hoped the transition from the soft crimson carpet of the corridor\
  \ to the firm marble of the staircase would sharpen my senses. I could no longer\
  \ blame the jet lag, I just don\u2019t do mornings. Echos of clanging crockery increased\
  \ with every step. On the first floor I found my room mate stood 2 places ahead\
  \ in the queue. I held my bit of paper between my thumb and forefinger, rolling\
  \ the corner into a tight, rigid tube. Having observed those ahead of me I was confident\
  \ of what was expected. I handed over my deformed ticket and raised my hand, palm\
  \ up, expecting the imminent arrival of a boiled egg. It landed, I grasped it, smiled,\
  \ and used the only Chinese word I know; \u2018xi\xE8xi\xE8\u2019. I turned towards\
  \ the tables, then heard something said behind me with an urgent tone. Please don\u2019\
  t be talking to me. I looked back over my left shoulder. She was talking to me.\
  \ I knew I couldn\u2019t say \u2018xi\xE8xi\xE8\u2019 again, it was clearly out\
  \ of context, but being the only word in my vocabulary I had no choice. Xi\xE8xi\xE8\
  . The slender lady, expressionless, turned her whole body in the opposite direction,\
  \ making my casual glimpse over the shoulder moments before look lazy and disrespectful.\
  \ Her arms were moving but the details of her actions were hidden from view by her\
  \ torso. She swivelled smoothly, then thrust her fist towards me. Had this been\
  \ a football match I\u2019d have clenched my own fist and bumped hers in a \u2018\
  great goal, pal\u2019 kind of way. But this wasn\u2019t a football match, I was\
  \ holding an egg, it was more like rugby. I looked her the in eyes and saw not frustration\
  \ as I\u2019d have expected in the face of such communicative ineptitude, but empathy\
  \ and a willingness to please. Her eyebrows raised and her gaze dropped to her hand.\
  \ She was giving me another egg! I quickly passed my first egg from the right hand\
  \ to my left then raised my hand, palm up, much as I had done before and collected\
  \ the second egg. I nodded cautiously, not daring to use any words for fear that\
  \ I\u2019d be burdened with a third egg. With another elegant twist normal service\
  \ was resumed. Meanwhile I stood stiff, becoming increasingly aware of the silence\
  \ that had fallen upon the dining room and the eyes that had fixed upon my back.\
  \ With a deep breath I turned around. The eyes all shot down, all but one pair.\
  \ An old man sat alone with a huge smile pulled out the clunky chair next to him\
  \ and pointed. I laughed, and walked towards the empty seat."
