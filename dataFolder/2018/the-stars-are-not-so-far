Text: "Darkness had already descended and it was time for me to change from outdoor\
  \ shoes to indoor slippers. Gopal was barefoot when he returned from the well fetching\
  \ a pail of water. So did his mother and sister.\n\nI was lying on a cot outside\
  \ the hut gazing at the twinkling stars. The prominent Milky Way looked like a stone\u2019\
  s throw away. The silence and absence of electricity was boon for my noise-thrashed\
  \ ears and city-lights blinded eyes. It was bane for Keya, Gopal\u2019s sister.\
  \ The lighted wicker fuelled by kerosene is Keya\u2019s only chance to a bright\
  \ future. The blaring of the radio is her only source of news. Electric supply had\
  \ arrived in the village a few years back, but this household is yet to afford the\
  \ luxury.\n\nGopal\u2019s mother, a lithe woman, was busy preparing meals for us-\
  \ rice, lentil soup and crispy deep-fried spiced lentils. I was happy to give my\
  \ junk-food rich diet a break and eat something simple. For Gopal\u2019s family\
  \ it was a lavish meal. Deep frying involves extensive use of oil. They cannot afford\
  \ to waste so much oil for one meal. But, that night they had a guest in me, that\
  \ night was special.\n\nThe current population of Bamnia village of West Bengal\
  \ are principally Brahmins- the exploiters of the caste system which plagued India.\
  \ Gopal narrated how Bamnia village was populated by tribes before their arrival.\
  \ During the heyday of the Brahmins they tortured and finally drove away the tribal\
  \ from their own land. The villagers now denote the ex-tribal population of the\
  \ village as the \u2018Hui people\u2019. Thankfully, the violence of the previous\
  \ generation was replaced by an open-minded approach of the current generation.\n\
  \nNext morning at 6AM the village was wearing a cloak of mist, a usual event in\
  \ winter mornings. Soft rays of the rising Sun illuminated the eastern sky. The\
  \ villagers were already on the dirt path, walking to their farmlands. They are\
  \ hard-working people. In an hour I will bid adieu to the village.\n\nThe postmaster\
  \ rang his bicycle bell. A tensed Gopal received the envelope. Sweat beads dazzled\
  \ on his forehead in a chilly morning. The corner of his eyes crinkled. Now he was\
  \ smiling. Tears of joy appeared. The mother and sister sensed the good news and\
  \ overwhelmed with happiness they thanked the various Hindu Gods and Goddesses.\
  \ Gopal, a post-graduate student in the nearest university got a white collar job\
  \ with one of the leading multi-national giants."
