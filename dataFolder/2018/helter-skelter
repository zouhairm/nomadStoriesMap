Text: "Approaching the Liverpool bus station, a typical passenger would have taken\
  \ in the industrial landscape with interwoven symbols of British charm. Marveled\
  \ at the ancient docks with glistening piers, the glass-encased shopping center\
  \ among the rosebush-lined avenues. My mission was different.\n\nThe Beatles songs\
  \ that hummed through my childhood were longing to be revived. I was commanded by\
  \ an itinerary jam-packed with quirky pit stops and obscure tributes. Beginning\
  \ with a journey through the city\u2019s core.\n\nThe pubs were drawn into a deep\
  \ sleep, hung-over from the previous night\u2019s shenanigans. But the tearooms\
  \ were incandescent, caffeinated from the buzz of the early-risers. Just as my destined\
  \ tea haven, purposefully placed next to a local bookshop. A Fab Four fortress.\n\
  \nAs I leafed through the treasure trove, the shop owner peaked his head into my\
  \ book-walled cavern. \u201CBeatles fanatic, huh? Well I could bend your ear\u2026\
  \u201D\n\nAnd the characters of Liverpool came to life. Figures featured in songs\
  \ that became cult anthems. \u2018The pretty nurse selling poppies\u2019 wandered\
  \ into his shop on occasion. Eleanor Rigby\u2019s inspiration was an astute woman\
  \ of the town, a local celebrity. Through his eyes, Liverpool sprouted, bloomed\
  \ into a scene brimming with personality.\n\nYearning to linger and absorb, but\
  \ dragged away by the itinerary\u2019s siren calling, I pressed on.\n\nWhen the\
  \ cobblestones trembled. Muffled screams punctured the air.\n\nA blurred mass of\
  \ combat boots and ink-colored veils had emerged from the crooked path, and my fight\
  \ or flight instincts were ignited. One, two\u2026before the third second struck,\
  \ paralytic shock jerked into a survival-mode sprint.\n\nThey charged forward, swallowing\
  \ the serene Britishness that defined the very streets, the moment. Crying out for\
  \ justice, redemption, safety\u2026Refuge. I reached for it as I swerved down a\
  \ dodgy alley. Taking a breath.\n\nThere had been mutterings of protests throughout\
  \ the U.K., but they were mere warnings scrolling innocently on news stations. The\
  \ empty threats had now transcended from digital platforms to reality.\n\nResurfacing\
  \ from the alley in a numbed trance, the city dwellers vibrated a sense of panic\
  \ and disruption to their perfectly proper afternoon. It had shifted.\n\nI immediately\
  \ understood that what was left of my relentless itinerary was abandoned. Maybe\
  \ I would return to the bookshop and offer the owner a cup of tea. Relish the simple\
  \ moments, the local tales. Because the mission had transferred. The bucket-list\
  \ could wait."
