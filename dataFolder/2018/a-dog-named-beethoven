Text: "I graduated university, packed my bags, moved to Ecuador and was assigned to\
  \ a volunteer work project in a remote village, deep in the Andes Mountains. With\
  \ only rudimentary Spanish, communicating became an exhilarating and unsettling\
  \ daily feat. I formed my mouth around unfamiliar words, jumbled sentences stumbled\
  \ out and then I stood bewildered at rapid responses fired back. There was also\
  \ a great cultural divide. The villagers lived in poverty, no running water or electricity.\
  \ They were very traditional, living three generations to each home, and strong\
  \ gender roles were the norm. They were kind, but mystified by my presence: a lone\
  \ professional American female in their midst. Moments of true communication were\
  \ euphoric, but there was often exhaustion, frustration trying to understand, and\
  \ be understood. \n It was a small joy to occasionally retreat in my apartment from\
  \ these challenges and inquisitive stares. On one of these days, I heard snarling\
  \ and grunting from my bedroom. I investigated with trepidation.\n A small, black\
  \ curly haired dog rolled around in my laundry basket of dirty linens, writhing\
  \ in intoxicated revelry. The sight was ridiculous and I burst out in a big laugh\
  \ at the intruder. He stopped momentarily to stare at me, and then resumed rolling,\
  \ snorting in the basket. \n This was Beethoven, my neighbour\u2019s dog, but he\
  \ really belonged to the street as a local sentinel. Standing alert in the dirt\
  \ road, he barked announcements of impending pedestrians, clattering mules, and\
  \ salsa blaring trucks.\n But he never barked at me, always greeted me with a sniff\
  \ at my feet and jaunty tail wag. He visited me at home occasionally, but his home\
  \ and heart were in the street.\n Once a month, I took the bus to the city that\
  \ departed at 5am. Bleary eyed, I'd emerge into chilly twilight, and sit on the\
  \ dusty curb, slightly shivering, alone. A scritching tick tick of his nails and\
  \ paws on the street, as he'd walk to me and it was a comfort that made me smile.\
  \ 'Beethoven!!' I\u2019d proclaim and ruffle him under his dirty stinky dog chin,\
  \ until he'd emit a grunt of happiness, plonk next to me with a sigh.\n Under shimmering\
  \ stars, the Andes Mountains a silhouette embrace around us, we\u2019d have one\
  \ moment of perfect contentment, complete understanding. Then, he\u2019d hear the\
  \ bus arriving from the distance, and leap to his feet, yip and yowl into the air,\
  \ and strut impatiently awaiting its arrival.\n My dutiful funny friend, in my mind,\
  \ he is always there standing watch."
