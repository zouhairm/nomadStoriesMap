Text: 'Finish the Tallinn, otherwise you will not be able to ride a camel "my father
  threatened me on December 30, 2013. My sisters and I wished we could take a camel
  ride through the desert on our holidays in Morocco. What we thought would be a great
  experience that we would always remember, was like that but not in the way that
  we would have liked.

  "Come to hurry girls that before sunset you have to take the walk," warned my mother,
  who very excitedly hired a 30-minute walk for my sisters and I for the sand giants,
  the desert dunes. At that time we were 14, 17 and 19 years old, and all we wanted
  was to have some good times in our particular Christmas.

  Everything was fine, when once deep into the desert and with the sky darker than
  it should have been, the cameleer brought the camels down and us, and to which we
  confused we asked him why? What was going on? The man told us that he wanted to
  show us the highest dune, that we should follow him. Quickly my older sister reacted
  and we all got on the camels communicating this man that we wanted and we should
  go back to the hotel, at first he refused, between us crossed looks full of fears,
  and in my case, the little sister, with some that another tear. We were lucky that
  this man regretted his plans and agreed to return us with our family, those 30 minutes
  of sweet waiting contemplating the beautiful desert, they became two long and harrowing
  hours wondering where their girls were and if they would return.'
