Text: "As I sat in Newcastle airport awaiting my flight to New York, tears overflowed\
  \ as I wondered if I was making a huge mistake. Was it too late to change my mind?\
  \ Should I go back home to my comfort zone, huddled under the protective wings of\
  \ my parents?\nAbsolutely not.\nThis was the trip I had always dreamed of. Just\
  \ 3 months earlier, I'd booked a two-month Trek America tour before I could talk\
  \ myself out of it.\nAnd now it was time.\nThe first month blurred by in a sea of\
  \ unusual activities, notably a trip to the corn palace (as the name suggests, a\
  \ palace made of corn \u2013 I couldn\u2019t resist buying a souvenir corn pen).\
  \ I had no time to worry about my anxieties as I was caught up in the bustling travel\
  \ lifestyle.\nThe second month stirred a new feeling within me.\nAs new members\
  \ joined our tour, one in particular caught my eye. Falling in love certainly wasn\u2019\
  t on my agenda and I was determined to stick to it. But love has a funny way of\
  \ showing up when you least expect it.\nDom was Australian and had booked the last\
  \ space on the trip after his original plan fell through. Although fate doesn\u2019\
  t rank highly in my reasonings, I had to admit that this was something along the\
  \ lines of destiny.\nFor the first few weeks, we built a respectable friendship.\
  \ We partied through Vegas and watched in awe as hundreds of hot air balloons ascended\
  \ with the sun at the celebrated Albuquerque Balloon Fiesta.\nWe finally admitted\
  \ our feelings during our final week. We spent our last day together in New York,\
  \ falling in love as we ambled through Central Park.\n10,439 miles away, we began\
  \ our journey apart. Christmas came in the shape of a shoebox filled with mementos\
  \ of our trip and thoughtful gifts over materialistic treasures. We revealed our\
  \ future hopes and dreams \u2013 mine of travelling and writing, Dom\u2019s of travelling\
  \ and photography. But our first goal was to do everything in our power to be together.\n\
  A year later reunited in Edinburgh, Dom turned in a flurry to face me holding an\
  \ engagement ring that sat daintily in a delicate lilac box. I was speechless, as\
  \ was Dom. The speech I imagine he had rehearsed endlessly remained in his heart.\
  \ The ring said everything that needed to be said. And I followed it with an almighty\
  \ yes.\nLove is difficult to define. It hits you when you least expect it, catching\
  \ you off-guard as feelings take over. Just when you thought it was impossible to\
  \ love someone more, the following day will prove you wrong for the rest of your\
  \ life as love continues to grow."
