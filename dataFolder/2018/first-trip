Text: "I remember the feeling of my first state of traveling, on a Friday night at\
  \ my hometown with some friends. As usual, the expectations were high, not knowing\
  \ of whom I was going to find on this particular night. And it was not a beautiful\
  \ blond Australian girl passing by on a road trip with her friends. It was Australian,\
  \ definitely, but a man instead. An older man than me, alone, sitting on a bench\
  \ on the street, outside a bar. His demeanor, his observing of everything, his attention\
  \ to minor details, embracing emotions and watching people go by like he was watching\
  \ a movie.  Curiosity takes over me and leads to him. I asked for a cigarette, he\
  \ asks my age, i replied: never mind, actually, I was just curious. Where are you\
  \ from? Australia, mate. And you? From here? Nice place, he said. He was a talker,\
  \ a big one, and I was a listener. He told me a lot of stories about many different\
  \ places, and his feeling of blessedness due to that. His most interesting tale\
  \ was about his first time alone in Europe. At 9am, while waiting for a bus to Stansted\
  \ Airport on his way to his next European destination, he saw a girl so beautiful\
  \ that he still smiles when mentioning it. She was waiting for another bus at the\
  \ same stop. Whilst observing, thought that she might be on her way to work. She\
  \ left before his bus. When he arrived at the airport, he couldn\u2019t leave. Thus,\
  \ he stayed in town so the next morning he could be there, at the same station,\
  \ at the same time. And she came. He approached and asked her name. He invited her\
  \ for a coffee but she said no. So he said nothing. The next day he was there again,\
  \ greeted her and asked if she would go for a coffee. Once more she said no. Then,\
  \ on the third day she asked if he was going to do this everyday and he answered\
  \ yes. That morning she didn\u2019t go to work. They married and are still together\
  \ to this day, both living in England. And she still doesn\u2019t like to travel.\
  \ He believes he travels for both, and when goes back to his home, always tell his\
  \ stories and adventures to his wife. And she loves that.  Sometimes the trip is\
  \ just the idea that makes your emotions and thoughts fly. Your own self traveling\
  \ through the stories around, without taking your foot from the ground. And how\
  \ Life embrace the stories and feelings of one another. Which tells us something\
  \ about Life, the most important journey of all. I would say that this man, this\
  \ conversation, was definitely my first trip."
