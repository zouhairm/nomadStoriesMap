Text: "A week in Gasp\xE9sie was a welcome break from the stifling intensity of the\
  \ city in late spring. Up north, the air was still cool and crisp and it filled\
  \ my lungs deeply. We finished cleaning the cabin we had rented and prepared to\
  \ go our separate ways. \n\nI waved goodbye to my friends. No, I don\u2019t need\
  \ a ride back into town. It\u2019s 40 miles out of your way in the opposite direction.\
  \ I have three hours before my train departs and the bus will arrive within the\
  \ hour. \n\nI looked over the Gulf of St. Lawrence as I waited. If I watched carefully,\
  \ I could see more whales breaching the surface. Blue and Humpback whales had made\
  \ their presence known throughout the week, and I was not tired of that sight.\n\
  \nTwo hours and 30 minutes before my train leaves. The landlady arrived on her roller\
  \ skis. She cross-country skied in the winter and wanted to keep in shape in the\
  \ warmer months. \n\nI shared stories of our week with her, about how we were charmed\
  \ by the friendliness of the locals, how we dodged bear poop on hiking trails, and\
  \ how we nearly hit a moose driving back to the cabin one night. \n\nShe laughed\
  \ and told me we were lucky it left us alone. Because of their size and how dangerous\
  \ they can be, she\u2019d much rather deal with a bear than a moose. \n\nTwo hours\
  \ and fifteen minutes before my bus leaves. She asks me what am I still doing here?\
  \ The bus is not running today. \n\nI turn on my phone to call my friends and it\
  \ immediately dies. Playing Depeche Mode for everyone to dance to by campfire, in\
  \ retrospect, was not a responsible use of my battery. \n\nI walk towards town as\
  \ quickly as I can. The woods that used to look so mysterious and romantic now looked\
  \ impassable and ominous. Faire du stop. I stick out my thumb. Cars pass without\
  \ slowing down. One hour and 45 minutes to departure.\n\nMy thoughts become tangential.\
  \ A bad situation reminds me of other bad situations. What was I doing with myself?\
  \ Did I really think a week in a different place could somehow fix my issues at\
  \ home? Am I really the kind of person who drains her cell phone battery for Depeche\
  \ Mode? Panic and hopelessness set in. Seventy-five minutes to departure. \n\nA\
  \ car pulls over in front of me. My thoughts spill over into my mouth as I explain\
  \ my gratefulness and anxiety to him. He smiles and listens to my broken French.\
  \ Thirty minutes to departure. We share life stories over coffee at a caf\xE9 near\
  \ the train station. He tells me, don\u2019t worry so much. Enjoy the moment. Who\
  \ knows when you may be back."
