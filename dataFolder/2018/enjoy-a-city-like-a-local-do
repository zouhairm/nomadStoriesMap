Text: "It was a cool Spring-Wednesday evening in London. My Latvian friend, Nikola\
  \ and I were on the floor of my dorm room having a conversation we\u2019ve repeated\
  \ about a hundred times before traveling. Nonetheless, after the cold winter chill,\
  \ we knew we needed the sun badly. Lisbon, Morocco, Madrid\u2026the list was awfully\
  \ tempting. Before I knew it, in a matter of minutes we were both booked for Ryan\
  \ Air on a direct flight to Barcelona, Spain. How exhilarating and simultaneously\
  \ terrifying. Prior to my transfer to UK, I\u2019ve received discouraging comments\
  \ with regards to the countries in the EU. So much so that whenever a European country\
  \ is mentioned, I can hear soft whispers in the breeze bringing words of precautions\
  \ against pickpockets and gypsies. It\u2019s that constant. I already had a visual\
  \ of Barcelona in my mind probably littered with strangers that hover over foreigners\
  \ and a disorganized, less-developed city. Naturally I braced myself I was determined\
  \ to hide my belongings discreetly, not to interact with overly friendly locals\
  \ and try to have as much as fun in isolation. But that all proved difficult the\
  \ second I landed because Spain felt like a big warm embrace the minute you step\
  \ onto her soil. I wish I can articulate how the atmosphere felt as accurate as\
  \ possible. For me, the best part of Spain was how it felt so alive in essence,\
  \ in spirit, physically, almost sensually. Everything was vibrating positively and\
  \ it made us all positive. We stayed in the heart of Barcelona, just close by to\
  \ Parc de Montjuic where he hiked. The weather and breeze rejuvenated our internal\
  \ system. Halfway through, we met two French men who was absolutely kind enough\
  \ to point us in the right direction. I remember laughing at my pre-empted notion\
  \ of Barcelona. It was not at all disorganised. In fact, the metro was better than\
  \ any that I have gotten on. Plaza Catalunya, Park Guell and Barceloneta beach were\
  \ all absolutely stunning places culturally rich with beautiful people, language\
  \ and cuisine. I met my friend Claudia, a local who taught us how to enjoy the local\
  \ paellas and Tarta de Santiago. There was no part of the entire trip that I felt\
  \ insecure or disappointed. We even caught the fiesta for the Segona Pasqua and\
  \ went with the singing and drumming parade down the street. How absolutely lucky\
  \ of us, we soaked in as much as we could of the joyous and welcoming atmosphere.\
  \ It was Spanish experience at its best. I\u2019ll definitely have to return."
