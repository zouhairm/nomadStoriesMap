Text: "\u201CThe elves still live in these rocks,\u201D our guide said, his eyes tracing\
  \ the fault lines along the rift valley to the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. \u201CSo they\
  \ say.\u201D\n\nI yanked the hood of my dry suit over my head, and from the small\
  \ oval left of my face, raised an eyebrow at my brother, Brent. These Icelanders\
  \ took their elves seriously. I wasn\u2019t sure I believed in elves, let alone\
  \ that they\u2019d want to live in a place like this. \n\nSilfra fissure was one\
  \ of many channels marbling the brownish marshland of Thingvellir valley. It lay\
  \ between the tectonic plates of North America and Eurasia, and was so deep that\
  \ it tapped into an underground glacial spring. Year round, the water temperature\
  \ remained around two degrees Celsius, and thanks to Brent\u2019s idea of a good\
  \ time, we were about to go snorkeling in it. \n\nRed-cheeked from the wind and\
  \ shivering in our clammy wetsuits, our group flipper-walked through the quagmire\
  \ to Silfra\u2019s fringe, like astronauts on a space mission. The water\u2019s\
  \ surface was crimped with capillary waves and speckled with snow-salt. I dragged\
  \ Brent to the back of the group and we watched as one by one the others slipped\
  \ into the icy water, gasping as it stole their breath. I cursed Brent as I got\
  \ in, my hands and feet nettling, unprotected. Adjusting my mask and snorkel, I\
  \ braced myself and put my face underwater.  \n\nThe glacial water was translucent\
  \ as air, and for a moment I forgot how to swim, to breathe. I was floating in the\
  \ hallway between continents, lit with ultramarine blue. Starfished on the surface,\
  \ I crooned through my snorkel, drifting in the wrong direction, too enchanted to\
  \ care. I could see more than forty metres below, right to the rubble and sand on\
  \ the bottom. It looked like moonscape.  \n\nOnce or twice, I put my head above\
  \ the water and looked around. It was like taking off 3D glasses. We were a foolish\
  \ sight, swimming in our slow wonky line, flippers flailing above the surface and\
  \ snorkels spluttering in the air.\n\nAt the narrowest part of the fissure I dolphin-kicked\
  \ down, and stretching out my arms, could just bridge the gap between the walls\
  \ with my fingertips. These continents would drift two centimeters apart next year,\
  \ and another two the year after that. All around me, algae swayed gently on the\
  \ rocks like green troll hair. Down here, it wasn\u2019t entirely impossible to\
  \ imagine elves living somewhere behind these rocky walls, one perhaps pressing\
  \ a finger to mine from the other side."
