Text: "Burrowed amongst the Sierra Aitana rests the Moorish municipality of Sella.\
  \ \u2018El Paradiso\u2019, the village people call it. This captivating commune\
  \ has a population of 600 and prior to our arrival our host tells the tale of a\
  \ thriving community. With the youth willingly continuing life in their safe haven\
  \ and a female mayor things were promising. Little did I know, an underlying force\
  \ was overcoming this Valencian village.  \n\nStanding on my terrace, the landscape\
  \ before me is one of almighty mountains watching over a valley of agricultural\
  \ terraces. The blushing blossoms of Almond trees are an ode to a once booming industry\
  \ that now provides only for locals. Orchards are now strung with remnants of old\
  \ trees succumbed to neglect. \u2018El Forno\u2019 has been a family business for\
  \ over a century. The baker\u2019s children have flown the nest to study with no\
  \ intention of taking over their artisan legacy, yet Maria would rather douse the\
  \ flames of her oven than have them give up on their dreams. \n\nAt the bottom of\
  \ the town lies the mill of Amable, a curious character who inherited the once prosperous\
  \ establishment through his ancestors. A man armed with hands muscled through the\
  \ labours of life; Amable is in his golden years. Having grown weary of the upkeep\
  \ his humble habitat requires, he would love to sell up and cross the world to Central\
  \ America or Indonesia. When asked why, he simply replies \u201CI know this village,\
  \ there is nothing left for me to learn here.\u201D\n\nThe elders\u2019 outlook\
  \ on the world showcases a strangely calm approach to the end of their vital crafts\
  \ to the community. Whilst these human livelihoods wane, it appears that Nature\
  \ is choosing to reclaim the village. Downpours that lead to landslides have garnished\
  \ Sella with the title of \u2018Climate Change Emergency Zone\u2019. Drought also\
  \ plighted the village for 4 years and I can\u2019t help but watch, as not only\
  \ the landscape but also the inhabitants prepare for a natural rebirthing of phoenix\
  \ proportions. \n\nStanding for the last time on this terrace, I now gaze upon a\
  \ valley of change. A time-honouring testament to the heritage of a hidden history,\
  \ Sella has proven to me that life goes on. Who knows what will become of the heirlooms\
  \ of humanity that lie in Sella\u2019s stories of grain to gastronomy. What new\
  \ stories will the inheritors of its charming casetas imbue in its labyrinthine\
  \ streets?"
