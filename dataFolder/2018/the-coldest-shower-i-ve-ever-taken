Text: "I'm dizzy as I hit it again, not sure if I'm sitting or standing. My mind is\
  \ a thick soup of laughter teetering perilously on the edge of panic. I reach down\
  \ to find a pocketful of sand and not much else. The dramamine helps but there is\
  \ still that screeching. Just trying to follow the coastline home, to lay down in\
  \ that bed and feel safe for a minute or two. Another sip and I might even sleep.\
  \ That pigeon hole isn't easy to find though. Getting there is even harder. The\
  \ winding path, it's often easier just to park along the way. Get out and walk to\
  \ the shore, have a quick cigarette and watch the waves. Pure indifference. It always\
  \ seems to be route 1. Iceland to New Zealand to Australia and home. Back out to\
  \ California to find that coastline. There isn't anything like the west coast. It's\
  \ fulfillment and wonder and beauty. At midnight in the mountains on the tip of\
  \ the Kaikoura Peninsula. Glacier water pumped into a showerhead placed high on\
  \ the wall in the middle of a concrete stall in the middle of a parking lot in the\
  \ middle of nowhere. My head is pounding as the water cascades over again and again.\
  \ The lights of oncoming cars smashing into my eyes. My feet begin to rip so I place\
  \ them back into my boots. Barefoot and wet but quiet. I can hear the waves outside\
  \ the van as another car passes in and out of the night. Gentle rumbling overhead,\
  \ a banana will get me through. Tomorrow I'll have some relish. I've never seen\
  \ so many curtains in my life. Not a single ounce of sun allowed in or out. 45 minutes\
  \ later and my toes have thawed and now have the warm tingling feeling that you\
  \ get when you have a snowball fight for too long right at the wet end of winter.\
  \ You have to cross \u2018em to really remember that they're there. Time slowly\
  \ expires as the nights turn into weeks. The days stay the same and suddenly it's\
  \ a year. You're 26 and tired but nowhere near finished. At least you hope, as that\
  \ tractor trailer comes around the bend at 120k. His sneeze could be your funeral.\
  \ As you flip dive through the windshield and down the hillside what would you be\
  \ thinking? Not bad. Shit. Well done. I fucked it. 50/50 but only 20/200. But is\
  \ that really the correct measurement? Is it the number of tricks or that one you\
  \ stomped bolts? That one you remember forever. Until your heart gives out and your\
  \ brain disintegrates. Then it's just you and forever kickin it while god of wine\
  \ plays on repeat. I bet heaven tastes like dramamine."
