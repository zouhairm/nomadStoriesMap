Text: "Building up a local connection in my conception it\u2019s not only having touch\
  \ with a local community, the connection must approach the city. We must look for\
  \ every wall in the streets, the one that shows a popular urban art and the one\
  \ that only show us a simple brick and it\u2019s cracks. Look for every building\
  \ that rises from the ground, the one that receives a great museum, mall or a so\
  \ much loved soccer stadium and the small houses that keeps a family that wakes\
  \ up early in the mornings having a reunion in kitchen\u2019s table for a breakfast\
  \ together, the only moment they really appreciate their company because kids are\
  \ in school all day as long as their parents are at work. We must look around the\
  \ parks, see how the plants and animals interact with each other and then with the\
  \ city and the routine of who passes by there. We must hear the sounds of vehicles\
  \ in a avenue, the sirens of ambulances, the song of birds contrasting with the\
  \ urban noise and even the steet cats in the alleys. Is necessary search for a lake\
  \ and see how the old ladies and kids feed it\u2019s ducks and doves around there\
  \ and appreciate a concert in a park or a huge presentation of an orchestra in theater.\
  \ When you already made a connection with the city and it\u2019s own treasures,\
  \ you can open your mind to know how people live their lives there. Sit in a bench\
  \ next someone is one step for having a good conversation, as like sitting next\
  \ someone in the bus or subway. You can ask tips for the locals, like where found\
  \ the best coffee in the city, the most cheaper outlet, a market to buy fresh fruits,\
  \ where find a hot bread, drink a local wine and even what you can do for have fun\
  \ at nights. You can also ask how to get a daily newspaper, the weekly magazine\
  \ and the last album of a popular singer of the country. You must ask about the\
  \ history of the city and the nation, about the wars they have already been and\
  \ the current political scenario. Someone can explain the causes they are fighting\
  \ for and how they are working for solve their social problems. A interesting point\
  \ for knowing is how the olders and the youngers look for the economics and politicals\
  \ structures of their country, sometimes they are together and sometimes there is\
  \ a lot of divergences in the values. It\u2019s also good having contact with foreign\
  \ residents there so you can see a point of view from someone that had to adapt\
  \ their own culture to another, like you are doing while analyzing the city that\
  \ you are traveling. Then you can enjoy it."
