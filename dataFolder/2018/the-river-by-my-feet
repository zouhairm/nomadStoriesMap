Text: "I was walking near the river Tejo, watching the sun disappear behind the clouds,\
  \ and the magnificent view of the blue colours turning red, orange and pink in the\
  \ sky. When this happens Germans use to say that \u201Cangels are cooking cookies\
  \ in the oven for us\u201D.\n\nFor the first time ever I was alone, and I was loving\
  \ every minute of it! It was my first time in Lisbon and in Portugal. The light\
  \ of this city dazzled my eyes ever since I arrived here. The narrow streets in\
  \ the old part of the city specially in the neighborhoods of Alfama, Bairro Alto,\
  \ or Mouraria near the Castle, made me feel very comfortable and at home. It was\
  \ amazing how this city recovered from the major earthquake and tsunami it suffered\
  \ in 1755, not so long ago, and still managed to maintain some of its traditional\
  \ features of that time. In these three neighborhoods (Alfama, Bairro Alto, or Mouraria\
  \ near the Castle) we can still encounter standing buildings whose construction\
  \ remained prior to this catastrophe.  \n\nAs I was walking, I noticed an old woman\
  \ approached me, silently and gently, and showed me her hands filled with wrinkles.\
  \ She was telling me something in Portuguese, I guessed, and pointing to the lines\
  \ of her hand. The minute after she was grabbing my own hands and telling me more\
  \ words in Portuguese. I only understood \u201Cvida\u201D, \u201Camor...\u201D.\
  \ \nI am sorry, I am afraid I do not understand what you are telling, sorry, I replied.\
  \ She did not even care for my reply and continued examining my hands carefully.\
  \ Strangely enough, I did not feel insecure, she seemed somehow familiar to me,\
  \ and her hazel-doe eyes were so tender and smooth. She pointed to my ring finger\
  \ and I laughed immediately. Yes, you are right, there is no man, I am not married,\
  \ I said while nodding my head. And she waved her head, like saying yes, yes, and\
  \ started blowing plenty of kisses, and embracing her own chest, acting like a true\
  \ enamored mime. \u201CSaudade\u201D was the last word she said, a feeling often\
  \ expressed by the emotive Fado music of this country, which means a mixture of\
  \ nostalgia, yearning, longing. She gave me a warm hug and left.\n\nI laughed to\
  \ myself and enjoyed the last minutes of the river breeze. Maybe love is just waiting\
  \ for me in the next corner of this city, who knows. I looked at my guide and headed\
  \ my way to the next city delight: to eat a traditional pastry from Lisbon, the\
  \ \u201CPastel de Nata\u201D which is served in a busy pastry shop in Bel\xE9m quarter,\
  \ normally filled with glutton tourists like me."
