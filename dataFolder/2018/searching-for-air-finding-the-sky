Text: "It was 3:05 AM and I was already awake, shivering after a fitful sleep. My\
  \ brain groggily recited synonyms of the word \u2018cold\u2019 just for emphasis.\
  \ Frigid. The alpine landscape looming just outside the thin walls filled me with\
  \ nervous adrenaline. Arctic. I donned my last layer and tied my boots, bare fingers\
  \ fumbling with the laces. Numbing. I steeled myself in front of the door, then\
  \ stepped into the night.\nI took a moment to thank the moon for illuminating the\
  \ trail, as my headlamp\u2019s batteries had succumbed to the cold the night before.\
  \ The wooden huts of high camp clung to the mountainside and, precarious as they\
  \ appeared, I couldn\u2019t help but feel I was leaving security behind as I began\
  \ my ascent. Sitting just shy of 17,800 feet above sea level, Thorong-La pass is\
  \ the highest point on one of Nepal\u2019s most breathtaking alpine treks. The Annapurna\
  \ Circuit is also breathtaking in the literal sense; upon reaching high camp I\u2019\
  d lost all hope of catching a fully satiating breath.\nI set out earlier than most,\
  \ knowing the trek would be painstakingly slow and lacking in the oxygen department.\
  \ My lungs screamed in protest with every step. For the first time, I doubted my\
  \ ability to simply put one foot in front of the other; the altitude was taking\
  \ its toll. Other trekkers soon caught up as I labored on, unable to catch my breath.\
  \ Less than halfway up I sank into a snowbank, utterly spent. My body ached with\
  \ fatigue. The remaining 1200 vertical feet seemed insurmountable. Minutes passed\
  \ as I dejectedly studied the ground. I decided I had to turn back. Just then, I\
  \ heard passing hikers croon in awe.\nLifting my head, I followed their gaze to\
  \ the summit of Thorong Peak. Alpenglow. A golden haze had settled atop the massive\
  \ peak, announcing the sun\u2019s arrival. I sat, dumbstruck by the cosmic light\
  \ show. Westward, the sky was dark, awaiting the inevitable wash of daylight. Stars\
  \ shone stubbornly, not yet surrendering to morning light. Eastward, a fiery hue\
  \ dominated the horizon, seeping slowly into the shadow that blanketed the nightscape.\
  \ It was an ethereal battle of twilights; both dawn and dusk hung in the air, temporarily\
  \ uncertain as to whose turn it was. I wanted to pause that moment, to stay inside\
  \ that fleeting liminal space, though I knew it was impossible. One can\u2019t reason\
  \ with the sun, after all.\n\nBitter cold wrenched me back to reality. I stood decidedly,\
  \ teetering on numb toes. With renewed resolve, I continued upwards. Slowly, slowly;\
  \ just as the rising sun."
