Text: "The first tears of that trip streamed down my cheeks, their wet trails cooling\
  \ my face against the abrasive heat of the West African coast. He stood right in\
  \ front of me, close enough to hug, to embrace, to comfort. He was 5. I was 19.\
  \ Complete opposites from opposite sides of the globe. He didn\u2019t understand\
  \ our words or sympathy but there he stood, resilient, and confused. The last thing\
  \ I expected on my first trip abroad was to meet a modern-day survivor. \n\nEight\
  \ months prior, unconcerned about money, safety, or shots, I announced to my parents\
  \ that I was going to Africa. Not being selected had never even crossed my mind.\
  \ And luckily my interviewer agreed.\n\nAs the youngest student selected to travel\
  \ to Ghana as part of my college\u2019s holiday abroad program, I stumbled through\
  \ a fall quarter filled with endless hours of trudging through fact-riddled African\
  \ history books, heated debates, and grueling papers. Yet I managed, and when winter\
  \ hit, we were en route to the Republic of Ghana.\n\nOur professors warned us that\
  \ we would constantly push the barriers of our comfort zone. We would come face\
  \ to face with poverty, guilt, illness, and sexism, and the trip would bring us\
  \ both distress and anguish as we discovered the roots of slavery and racism throughout\
  \ the country, and peered directly into the gruesome history of the international\
  \ slave trade.\n\nAnd they were right. But hospitalization, dehydration, nor diarrhea\
  \ would stop our group. I was the first to be sick. I spent Christmas night on a\
  \ toilet, stomach cramping in the severe heat, drifting in and out of awareness\
  \ while my headlamp hung from my neck and a three-inch cockroach flirted with my\
  \ feet. Each time the toilet seat slipped from its base, I would come-to, adjust,\
  \ and drift off again. Memorable, yes, but nothing could have prepared us for the\
  \ day our driver lost his way.\n\nToward journey\u2019s end, our rickety bus rumbled\
  \ down a road in search of the Fort of Good Hope. Instead, we happened upon a simple\
  \ orphanage. Children, clothed in hand-me-downs, gathered in the courtyard for their\
  \ annual photo. That\u2019s when we met Mark, who was sold into slavery by his very\
  \ own parents just five weeks prior. He had been owned by another human. His small\
  \ stature and oversized clothes could never tell the story behind his sheepish expression.\
  \ Here we were, a group of American college students grasping to comprehend the\
  \ idea of slavery, yet little did we expect it to stare back at us, through the\
  \ eyes of a former slave."
