Text: "At the age of thirty-two, I ventured outside of my home country, India, for\
  \ the first time. For someone with traditional middle-class upbringing this was\
  \ a normal thing. To put things into perspective - I took this trip with my mother,\
  \ who, to celebrate her fiftieth birthday, was also venturing out of India for the\
  \ first time. Between us, we clocked over 80 years of never having left the country\
  \ we were both born in.\n\nIf you\u2019re thinking, \u201Cgreat, another middle-aged\
  \ lady celebrating her fiftieth on a cruise ship,\u201D you\u2019re not even close.\
  \ My mom had been an active CouchSurfing host for over fifteen years;  the time\
  \ had come for host to become the hosted.\n\nWhere did I figure in all of this?\
  \ A breezy \u201Cwhy don\u2019t you come along? It\u2019ll be fun!\u201D from her\
  \ sparked a desire in me that had been repressed for far too long. A desire strong\
  \ enough for me to overlook the fact that I had just agreed to spend four weeks,\
  \ with my mother, backpacking across Europe and sleeping in strangers\u2019 homes.\
  \ \n\nWhat we would experience during the one month in Europe was the travel equivalent\
  \ of a hallucinogen-induced trip. We were bombarded with brand new experiences every\
  \ single day, and they were miles off the beaten track. In Amsterdam, our Norwegian\
  \ host took us out to lunch at a cafe inside a shipping container, right next to\
  \ a hotel inside a crane. Real life or dream sequence? Bit of both, as Amsterdam\
  \ is wont to be. In Copenhagen, we lived with my mom\u2019s old CouchSurfing buddy\
  \ and her coterie of humans and three pets (a dog, a cat and a desert lizard), where\
  \ she took us mushroom-picking, to Tango class, and even a vegan community luncheon;\
  \ I can still see that whole baked parsnip when I close my eyes. Our first dinner\
  \ in Berlin was at an underground, anarchist people\u2019s kitchen in gentrified\
  \ Friedrichshain, where dingy interiors and grunge music belied its warmth; a large\
  \ sign over the bar said, \u201CTHIS IS A SAFE SPACE. IF YOU FEEL DISCRIMINATED\
  \ AGAINST, PLEASE COME TO THE BAR AND WE WILL PROTECT YOU.\u201D Typical Berlin:\
  \ a furiously pumping heart covered in grime. In Krakow, we stayed with a lovely\
  \ Polish girl and her fox terrier, who could play fetch for hours on end and slept\
  \ in my bunk the entire time we were staying there, stinking up my blanket with\
  \ his farts. I didn\u2019t mind. What can I say, it was cold!\n\nThey say you never\
  \ forget your first time, although we made darn sure it was near impossible to.\
  \ Still, I had the trip route tattooed on my arm, just in case."
