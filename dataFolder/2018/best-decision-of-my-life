Text: "It was 2006 and I was in a failed relationship and dissatisfied with my career.\
  \  I needed to do something about it but I was hopeless in finding a solution. One\
  \ day, I was putting some documents away and I found my passport. I had a smile\
  \ on my face while looking at it. I used to travel a lot, explore different countries\
  \ and culture. Somehow, this relationship made me forget my passion for traveling.\
  \  Looking at my stamps, there were so many different places I have been to. Then\
  \ I realized what I had to do. I grabbed my computer and booked a flight to Cambodia\
  \ next week. I didn't tell him. The only person I told was my boss, who didn't like\
  \ the short notice trip. \n\nWhen I arrived at the airport, I did what most tourists\
  \ do: exchange dollars for local currency. Everyone knows that the exchange rate\
  \ at the airport is the worst, but I had no choice. There was not Cambodian currency\
  \ to exchange available in my city.  I was very surprised to know that, Cambodians\
  \ prefer dollar than their Cambodian Riel. Some of them actually only accept dollars.\
  \ \n\nI was introduced to a local guide by the hotel manager. who would help me\
  \ to explore Angkor Wat. Everything there seemed extremely cheap. I had delicious\
  \ a meal with beer for less than 10$.  \n\nMy guide came to pick me up on our first\
  \ day exploring Angkor Wat. The landscaping was magnificent. I was lucky to have\
  \ enough time to appreciate and not only take pictures. Anywhere you go, there are\
  \ children trying to sell you something. People there live a very simple life but\
  \ they seem very happy. When you observe them, they are always welcoming you and\
  \ smiling. I saw monks in their orange traditional costume and I had the privilege\
  \ to take some great shots with monks and the temples.\n\nI was surprised how they\
  \ could be so happy in such poor economy, On the other hand, I had a well-paid job\
  \ in a bank, a nice apartment, traveling the world and I was so miserable. In the\
  \ end of my fourth of my Angkor Wat, I knew I had to change my life. I came back\
  \ to Brazil, asked for the divorce, quit my well-paid job and decide to move to\
  \ Canada and study psychology. It has been 3 years I am leaving in Vancouver now.\
  \ I work part-time as a nanny and full-time pet sitter. I earn way less than I used\
  \ to, but I am way happier. I have a simpler life, in a safer country but I am still\
  \ able to travel. And traveling is something I will never stop doing, no matter\
  \ where I live."
