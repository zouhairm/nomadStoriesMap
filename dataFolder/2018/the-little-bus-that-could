Text: "When asked to think of examples of marine vehicles, we might conjure up images\
  \ of yachts, cruise ships, trawlers and submarines. When asked to think more abstractly\
  \ our thoughts might stretch to jet skis, hovercraft or amphibian planes. But if\
  \ I told you that your run-of-the-mill bus could (sort of) achieve the same feats\
  \ as these modes of water transport, you\u2019d call me crazy. However, this is\
  \ indeed what I discovered on a trip to Iceland last Summer.\n\nWe \u2013 myself\
  \ and a team of charity volunteers \u2013 were headed to Landmannalaugar near the\
  \ island\u2019s centre to begin the epic trek of fifty-eight kilometres along the\
  \ Laugavegur trail. The team faced a week traversing Iceland\u2019s incredible wilderness,\
  \ accompanied by thundering crystal waterfalls, bubbling lava fields and steaming\
  \ sulfuric geysers.\n\nHaving touched down at Keflavik airport and acquainted ourselves\
  \ with one-another, we were met by a somewhat rickety-looking bus driven by our\
  \ trail guide, Gumi. This was to be our four-hour transfer to the first camp. For\
  \ the most part, the journey was smooth. We drank in the breath-taking, alien scenery\
  \ as we passed through endless natural countryside. \n\nAbout three hours into the\
  \ transfer, the bus began off-roading as we neared our destination. The pleasant\
  \ part of the journey was over. Driving over wildly uneven plains of volcanic rock\
  \ and sand, the bus vibrated violently. Our backs were pummelled by the constant\
  \ juddering of the seats. On a number of occasions, the bus seemed close to tipping\
  \ completely over. \n\nThen came the river crossings. The first time our path was\
  \ blocked by a wide flow of water, it seemed that we would need to find an alternative\
  \ route. Little did we know that river crossings were but a trifle to the Icelandic\
  \ folk. Without hesitation, Gumi drove head-on into the water. To our complete amazement,\
  \ the bus lost little speed, and emerged at the other side within seconds. This\
  \ trick was to be repeated numerous times to equal success. Only once did a river\
  \ prove to be too much of a match for our many-wheeled stallion, when we had to\
  \ take a small detour to a narrower stretch. \n\nHaving simultaneously been utterly\
  \ amazed and thoroughly battered, we at last arrived at the first camp. We were\
  \ rewarded for our plight and patience with a stunning view over a glistening fjord,\
  \ encompassed by towering, snow-capped hills. The night was then rightfully spent\
  \ soaking away our cares in the natural hot springs and indulging in homemade local\
  \ cuisine."
