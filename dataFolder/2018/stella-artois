Text: "Have you ever heard of Goon ? If you are in Australia and are hoping to get\
  \ drunk real quick, Goon is the answer. It is basically wine which is sold at a\
  \ nominal price for an obnoxious quantity. What's really surprising is how good\
  \ it tastes and couple of glasses down you find yourself dancing to Bollywood songs\
  \ with newfound friends from different continents on the terrace of your hostel.\
  \ It's surreal. It's unforgettable. \n\nMy two girlfriends and I were staying at\
  \ a backpackers in Surfers Paradise, Goldcoast, Australia and this night started\
  \ with Goon and drinking games. The next thing on the agenda was to make it to a\
  \ night club. Goon had already cut our troop of 3 to 2 but as young adults we still\
  \ had hope. The two of us started the long march to the club, only to be barred\
  \ from entering the club, my friend had forgotten to carry her passport. \n\nWe\
  \ probably should have given up but like I said we had hope. We trudged our way\
  \ back to the hostel collected the passport and were returning to the club when\
  \ the last thing I expected happened. On our way back we bumped into a guy from\
  \ Belgium who was lost. You wouldn't believe it with smartphones, internet and GPS.\
  \ Despite that we met a guy who had lost his phone and couldn't remember the name\
  \ of his hostel. \n\nDesperate times call for desperate measures, I decided to take\
  \ this guy under our wing. We ditched a night of partying to help him out. It's\
  \ important to remember that, my friend and I were not the two most rationale creatures,\
  \ all thanks to the Goon but I wouldn't change this night given the option. What\
  \ followed was pretty darn hilarious. I googled all the hostels in the 5 km radius\
  \ from where we were and started naming the one's in the vicinity. We also tried\
  \ to walk around the block to see if he could recognize the streets. After literally\
  \ walking around for an hour and a half we finally hit the jackpot, he recognized\
  \ the name of his hostel. You wouldn't believe me if I told you that the name of\
  \ his hostel was Down Under. Yes. DOWN UNDER. The irony of the entire situation\
  \ was not lost on me!\n\nFor all the effort we had put in the mission we were promised\
  \ Stella Artois. The night ended with us sitting on the sidewalk and having long\
  \ conversations about life and our experiences. Importantly, the promised beer !\
  \ Such experiences make travelling worth it, it's not just the sights, the buildings\
  \ or the places; it's also the people and the experiences which makes seeing the\
  \ world a beautiful experience."
