Text: "I decided to work abroad as an English teacher in Segovia, Spain. When I arrived\
  \ I was exhausted from the 14hour plane ride and had my purse stolen on the metro,\
  \ which had my passport and wallet. Desperate for help I rushed to the US Embassy.\
  \ I had to process an original passport that would arrive in a week. The morning\
  \ only brought more bad news.  The Spanish government emailed me that if I couldn\xB4\
  t open a Spanish bank account by the end of the day I wouldn\xB4t receive my salary\
  \ till March. (It is extremely difficult to open a Spanish bank account as an American\
  \ and even more so when you do not have a passport). Once my passport arrived, I\
  \ fled to Segovia where I was welcomed by negative degree temperatures and non-stop\
  \ snowfall. A coworker let me stay in her home until I found a place of my own.\
  \ Working full time without pay made it difficult to find a lease that wasn\u2019\
  t too expensive. To add to my stress, my aunt on my dad\u2019s side passed away\
  \ from heart problems. She was the first of 8 to pass away.  The feeling of being\
  \ 4,000 miles away and unable to hug him hurt my heart. To make some extra cash,\
  \ I began to give private English tutoring classes. I had saved enough money for\
  \ a deposit at a flat. A day after I moved in, I received the devastating news that\
  \ my grandmother had passed away in her sleep. Two incredible losses within weeks\
  \ of each other was soul crushing. As soon as my parents found out they marched\
  \ to Mexico for the funeral. I couldn\u2019t afford a plane ticket so my only option\
  \ was to mourn alone. A month into my job the Spanish government has yet to pay\
  \ me. I couldn\u2019t even contemplate asking my parent\xB4s for money because I\
  \ didn\u2019t want to add another expense to their plate. Seeing my students excited\
  \ to learn made my time worthwhile. Everything began to fall into place when I created\
  \ a routine. Problems would occur anywhere it didn\u2019t matter what country I\
  \ was in. This bad luck couldn\u2019t last forever. I knew my decision to live abroad\
  \ would come with its consequences. Nevertheless, I stuck to my ambitions no matter\
  \ the reckless path it took me on. One of my downfalls but also my strongest qualities\
  \ is that I can be quite stubborn. Others would agree that I also carry too much\
  \ pride. Stubbornness and pride together can get the better of you but I believe\
  \ in moments of distress they give you the strength to push forward. I was definitely\
  \ pushed to the edge with my life changing decision but I do not regret it."
