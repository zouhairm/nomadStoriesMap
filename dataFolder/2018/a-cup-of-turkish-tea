Text: "It was six in the morning. We arrived in the city of Istanbul by plane and,\
  \ after a lot stuffs to check in the airport, we caught the metro.\nThe wrong one.\n\
  My boyfriend and I started to discuss in the metro, in italian of course, because\
  \ we were tired and we already lost ourself and we didn\u2019t know how to reach\
  \ the hostel. \nWe arrived in the last metro stop and we decided to go out to understand\
  \ better what to do. \nBut suddendly a man that was close to us in the metro with\
  \ two big olicans stopped us asking if we needed help. I immediately replied that\
  \ we didn\u2019t. Of course. We were in the suburbs of the city, at six in the morning,\
  \ for the first time in Turkey, stopped by stranger, I could never trust him. \n\
  But he was so kind, as someone that has understood immediately the situation without\
  \ speaking a word of Italian, that we decided to talk with him.\nHe explained us\
  \ how to reach the city center but he also added \u201CI live very close to here,\
  \ why you don\u2019t come in my house for cup of tea?\u201D \nWe are from Napoli\
  \ and we saw this offer like it happens with a cup of coffee in our city. So we\
  \ decided to go with him. His house was a mess. He was sorry for it and he explained\
  \ us that his family was out for holiday and he was very happy that his wife was\
  \ out for a little because \u201Cthe marriage is not easy\u201D, he said. \nHe started\
  \ to tell us about his family and finally our conversation touched upon the more\
  \ different topics: life, religion, differences, politics, traditions and so on.\
  \ Everything in front a good cup of the traditional turkish tea. Altought we had\
  \ some difficulties with the languages we could understand exactly each other. \n\
  I was immediately in love with their culture and that hospitality so close to ours\
  \ and to that one of all the people from the South. \nOur trip couldn\u2019t start\
  \ in a better way. We spent some hours there, then he went with us until the bus\
  \ stop, avoiding that we lost again, showing us some stuffs of that quarter and\
  \ finally we said goodbye promising to call him during our days in Istanbul."
