Text: "Ethnic tastes of Kerala are best tried out in the rustic villages where the\
  \ flavors and spices are not marred by chemically enhanced additions. The ever spicy\
  \ Kerala fish recipes garner more followers by the day. Tucked away in a corner\
  \ of Kochi is the island of Gothuruthu where sardines retain the ethnic flavors\
  \ that makes the Kerala fish recipe popular\n\n\n\nApproximately 24 km away from\
  \ Kochi, Gothuruthu is an island in the Periyar River that boasts of a history dating\
  \ 600 years back. Methodical studies state that this island was formed as a result\
  \ of a flood in the early 14th century. Gothuruthu is set at a place where there\
  \ was once an ancient port city called Muziris . It is believed that the name of\
  \ the island came from the Portuguese name of the island San Diego.  \n\n\nEvery\
  \ year lot of celebrations and cultural programmes takes place here and it is part\
  \ of the life of inhabitants here. Owing to this, the island is known as the 'Island\
  \ of Festivals'. The island has plenty of legacies related to culture, tradition,\
  \ lifestyle and cuisine of the past through the people who live here today. Sardine\
  \ is one of the most common fish found in the coast of Gothuruthu. Found in large\
  \ numbers, it is a popular variety in the local cuisine. I was always under the\
  \ impression that you couldn\u2019t prepare more than ten dishes from sardines but\
  \ my belief was shattered the day I met Rosamma Chedathy(local name for sister).\
  \  Rosamma Chedathy can quite easily prepare 20 dishes with sardines that include\
  \ cutlet, pepper sardine, stew, and fry or even roasted. \n\nA one hour bus journey\
  \ from Kochi takes you to Gothurthu and from there; a ten minute walk takes you\
  \ to Rosamma\u2019s house. A humble and down to earth woman with a gift of creating\
  \ heaven through your plates, she is the representative of a generation that is\
  \ ready to share the secret recipes of the Gothurthu cuisines. \n\nHer passion for\
  \ the craft is evident when she declares that cooking is an art. The confident tone\
  \ with which she seems to declare that she is one amongst the artists of cooking,\
  \ her statement turned out to be more than confidence as I tried out the magic she\
  \ created by preparing five sardine dishes with absolutely no qualms within a an\
  \ hour and that too artistically. A sardine stew, crispy sardine cutlet, spicy boiled\
  \ sardine, sardine fried in banana leaf, hot red sardine curry, she announced as\
  \ she served the items one by one. Each of these goes well with traditional pancake."
