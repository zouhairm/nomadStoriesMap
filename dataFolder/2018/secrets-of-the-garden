Text: "It was a few days into my stay in India before my hosts carved out time to\
  \ take me to the Rock Garden in Chandigarh. Described somewhere as the second-most\
  \ visited Indian tourist destination after the Taj Mahal, clearly hyperbole, it\
  \ held neither name recognition nor gravitas for me. I was in for an incredible\
  \ surprise. Perhaps that was the feeling it evoked over forty years ago when this\
  \ hidden treasure was inadvertently discovered. \n\nDisplaced from his village north\
  \ of Lahore by Partition in 1947, a young Nek Chand Saini escaped the threat of\
  \ massacre. Leaving all possessions behind, he fled into an unknown future. Traveling\
  \ sixty miles on foot, he spent weeks encountering various dangers, not the least\
  \ of which was fording the swollen River Ravi. Reaching the north of India, he eventually\
  \ settled in the newly developed state capital, the City Beautiful, a modern concrete\
  \ city under design by celebrated architect Le Corbusier. Employed as a road inspector,\
  \ Nek Chand quietly initiated a rogue project of his own.  \n\nIn 1958, he covertly\
  \ began what was to be a lifelong occupation. Built on public lands, without permission,\
  \ the secret space was detected by authorities some eighteen years into the trespassing\
  \ sculptor\u2019s artistic vision. Luckily, the magic of its artistry shielded it\
  \ from demolition. Given a staff of laborers to direct, and working strictly without\
  \ plans or sketches, Nek Chand set about supervising construction of his dream.\
  \ Earth was moved to build walls, bridges, staircases and winding paths.\n\nNek\
  \ Chand\u2019s kingdom of deities had now become what I was awed and humbled to\
  \ discover for myself. The bright sky on the day we spent at the garden held no\
  \ memory of the monsoon-like rain of the previous day.  Moving through tiny arches\
  \ and constricted spaces into a broad ambulatory, passing through sunlight and shade,\
  \ crossing footbridges and passing towering waterfalls, the journey through the\
  \ garden set a spellbinding mood.  \n\nIt was, however, the collections of mosaic\
  \ statues that inspired wonder. To stand before the stone figures is to stand in\
  \ marvel of the healing power of the creative spirit. No life escapes adversity.\
  \ Nek Chand is not the last to be forcibly expelled from his native home. He is\
  \ not the last to witness horror, nor to fear death, nor to cross uncertain waters.\
  \ But human resilience can be seen in his endurance and in his tenacity. It can\
  \ be found in becoming absorbed in a personal, meaningful endeavor, and sometimes\
  \ in a well-kept secret."
