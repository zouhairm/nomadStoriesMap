Text: "I remember perfectly the day I first stepped on Mount Vesuvius. I was enjoying\
  \ my Erasmus year in Naples and my mother and sister had come to visit.\nAfter a\
  \ few tiring hours under the sun visiting Pompeii, we took an offroad bus that took\
  \ us almost to the top. After a 20 min hike along a steep slope that was no joke,\
  \ I made my first breathing stop and wow: Naples and its surroundings extended before\
  \ my eyes. Millions of houses cramped in big chaos that reached to the sea.\nTruth\
  \ be told, seeing a volcano live is much less exciting than you would think. The\
  \ crater is way too big to visualise it as the image that\u2019s in your head. It\
  \ simply looks like any other risk or crag. The best I took from that day was the\
  \ highest views of Naples I got, that I was barely relating with the ground I was\
  \ standing on. \nThat\u2019s why, at first, I didn\xB4t feel that connected to the\
  \ neapolitan symbol, but, alas, was I wrong! Vesuvius has been like a friend in\
  \ the shadow that you don\u2019t miss until it\u2019s gone. \nI started loving it\
  \ those autumn days when it would peek between the lowest clouds and an orange-filled\
  \ sunset. The worst thing was when, in winter, I would walk to the 'lungomare' (seafront)\
  \ to discover that I could only see the same thing that from any other point in\
  \ the city: clouds. Clouds as big as similar among them and of course, covering\
  \ Mount Vesuvius. In those moments I thought that if only i could have seen it,\
  \ the walk and the cold would have been worth it. \nThat\u2019s how I realised why\
  \ neapolitans cared so much about their volcano, far from seeing it as a danger,\
  \ for them it\u2019s something to be proud of. It actually is danger itself: almost\
  \ a million people live where the danger zone locates if it were to erupt. They\
  \ don\u2019t even care. That\u2019s the neapolitan way of life, if it\u2019s not\
  \ a problem today, why worry? They would rather enjoy the wonderful Mount that represents\
  \ their city so well.  \nThe last days I spent in Naples I would stare at it every\
  \ time I got a chance. My head was full of feelings and thoughts that I didn\u2019\
  t know how to process. I had spent the last 10 months of my life learning about\
  \ a city, a language and most of all, its people. But that was the effect the volcano\
  \ had on me, it was a safe place. A friend to visit that won\u2019t bother you with\
  \ questions or ask for explanations, it\u2019s silently keeping you company. I learned\
  \ to love that volcano and it will always put a smile on my face whenever I see\
  \ it."
