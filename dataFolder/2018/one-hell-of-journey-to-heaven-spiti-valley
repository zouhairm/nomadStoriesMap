Text: "A journey into myself.\nSometimes all we need is the journey rather than reaching\
  \ the destination.\n\n4am, we left Kullu, Unsure, dozy, tired. Took a dare to catch\
  \ a glimpse of Himalayas. Spiti Valley.\n\nTraveling in the Himalayan roads and\
  \ taking the back seat of the bus made it much scarier. The roads filled with challenges,\
  \ twists and turns, but HRTC drivers taking the wheel, made it look like effortless.\
  \ Hats off.\n\nAfter recharging our self in Chacha-Chachi dhaba, we could able to\
  \ get a ride to the Chandratal lake.\nTo thrill ourself, took a spin to the crazier\
  \ side by travelling in the rough roads of Himalayas on the back of the taxi.\n\n\
  On the way walking to the lake, one eye restlessly searching the lake and other\
  \ embracing the infinite landscapes of the mountain range.\nTo feel the purest form\
  \ of water, one has to be determined enough to stand in the freezing cold water.\n\
  \nNever thought I could able to experience such Dreamscapes of Himalayas in this\
  \ age. One will be wonderstruck to witness the calmness of the scenic view of lake\
  \ in between the mighty mountains.\n\nAfter a day break in Batal, meeting Mr.Tenzing\
  \ (Our uncalled driver/guide/caretaker) was all we needed. It is a astonishing thing\
  \ to meet such modest people in those remote places. Indebted.\n\nThe best part\
  \ is, late night conversation never fails to bring the group come closer\n\nThe\
  \ unplanned Bliss.\n.\nThis is what happens when you meet right people in the most\
  \ least expected places.\n\nKaza. A small city, kind people, amazing food and breathing\
  \ taking view with heart warming hospitality will make one forget all the worries\
  \ ever existed. \nKomic. World's highest village(15087 ft) with World's highest\
  \ restaurant offering some fine food, makes anyone to leave everything just to grab\
  \ a bite.\n\nHikkim. World's highest Post office (14567 ft) is one of the main attraction.\
  \ To write a post to the loved ones (or to yourself) is a must.\n\nThis land has\
  \ some magical breeze which makes one rethink about the purpose of life.\n\nExploring\
  \ the Himalayas, reaching some highest points of the world made me realize how insignificant\
  \ place we occupy in this whole wide earth. Roaming in the streets of Kaza, waking\
  \ up in between the mountains, savoring the Himalayan dishes, with the kindest mankind\
  \ around. \nHomed."
