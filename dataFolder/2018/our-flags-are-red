Text: "I wouldn't necessarily call myself a patriot.I\u2019d finally made it to the\
  \ beautiful city of Amritsar,Punjab.It's a place that subtly engulfs you with it's\
  \ culture and tradition right from the get-go.The Punjabis are known to be a vibrant\
  \ folk full of fun and enjoyment.In other words,they love a good party.On the streets,the\
  \ women are usually seen wearing a colourful salwar-kameez,while the men are always\
  \ seen to be sporting a turban,which,apart from being an essential part of their\
  \ daily-attire,is more a symbol of pride and their beliefs.In a nutshell,for a person\
  \ of the Sikh faith to be considered a bona fide follower,they must willfully obey(apart\
  \ from some other requisites)the 5-Ks i.e.Kesh(never cut or trim any hair on their\
  \ body),Kangha(use only a wooden comb twice a day),Kachera(wear a non-elastic cotton\
  \ undergarment),Kara(wear a steel/iron bracelet),Kirpan(carry an iron dagger).There\
  \ are a few must-visit sites while here,but what I\u2019d like to focus on is my\
  \ experience at the Wagah Border.I made my way there one Thursday evening with my\
  \ fianc\xE9e and a couple of friends.Before I delve any further,the Wagah Border\
  \ is a part of the line which separates India and Pakistan.On watching both nation\u2019\
  s flags pulsate several metres above,the gravity of where I was set in and I realised\
  \ that one will not find a more enthusiastic and in-your-face display of amicable\
  \ patriotism anywhere else in the country(quite possibly on either side) that compares\
  \ to this.A playlist of patriotic Hindi songs boomed and distorted through the speakers,inspiring\
  \ the patriots in attendance to leap to their feet and dance.I looked over the gate\
  \ to see if the Pakistani zeal matched ours.It didn\u2019t.There was a highly-skilled\
  \ one-legged male dancer who was made to enthrall the crowds while the attendees\
  \ sat in their chairs.I wasn\u2019t surprised to see that the women(burkha-clad)\
  \ and men were seated separately.The ceremony commenced.It was a series of somewhat\
  \ comical dance-like but well-founded moves performed by soldiers of both nations.My\
  \ unforgettable moment came at the very end when both flags were slowly lowered,almost\
  \ in unison with the setting sun.My skin veiled in goosebumps as I pondered over\
  \ the many lives that were and are being lost over an age-old animosity.To this\
  \ day,it\u2019s a hatred that continues to make bloods boil and convince youngsters\
  \ to join the armed forces,while I get to lethargically remember their sacrifice\
  \ from the safety of my home,set miles away from the borderline."
