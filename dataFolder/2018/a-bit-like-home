Text: "The immense heat. The incredible deep humid heat I felt as I got off the plane.\
  \ At that moment a question popped my mind: this will be the weather during all\
  \ my staying? The answer came in the days after: yes...this is Macao. Be prepared\
  \ for 40\xBAC and a heavy rain capable of destroying the most resistant pair of\
  \ shoes. \nUntil 1999 Macau was under portuguese administration and was an important\
  \ point of connection between Europe, Japan and China. Macao is now a Special Administrative\
  \ Region of the People's Republic of China, but this connection between several\
  \ cultures remain. The link to Portugal is way stronger than I would had imagined:\
  \ I knew I was in China, but it remind me a lot of the Portugal I grew up during\
  \ the 80\u2019s: the intricate designs of portuguese pavement; the streets names\
  \ in portuguese (and cantonese), the old portuguese id plaques in old portuguese\
  \ cars and even portuguese pastry and coffee. \nOn the arrival day one quite unexpected\
  \ thing happened and would put a smile on my face afterwards. \nArrived early morning\
  \ after a long journey: an early departure from Lisbon, a quick stop at Rome airport\
  \ madness, a 12 hours flight to Hong Kong and a 60 minutes ferry boat sailing until\
  \ arriving to Macao. Feeling a bit jet lagged tipsy I went for a lunch with F\xE1\
  tima, a portuguese living in Macau for the past 17 years. The restaurant, located\
  \ in the old town, was in the 2nd floor of an old building with some 80\u2019s feel\
  \ to it. Something in there felt home, but not sure of what. After lunch I decided\
  \ to return to the hotel with one of my coworkers, so I could organize the next\
  \ day of work and sleep for a while. Before I could think about anything else, millions\
  \ of drops started to fall in this jungle of led lights buildings -  sparkles and\
  \ lights bring good luck and fortune. In 2 minutes our feet were submerged as we\
  \ were trying to find our way back to the hotel.The stairs and paths became waterfalls\
  \ and all the small references were now gone. We tried to ask some women for information,\
  \ but our empty cantonese knowledge seemed a problem. After some walking we found\
  \ a open store: a hairdresser. We entered and try to ask our path back in english.\
  \ She looked at us with a wide smile. Started to speak in english but then just\
  \ asked in a flawless portuguese:\nAre you portuguese? You were speaking in portuguese.\
  \ We can speak in portuguese!\nOur eyes opened and our jaws fall. This was the most\
  \ unexpected thing in Macao. Suddenly it felt a bit more like home."
