Text: "WE FOLLOW THE ROAD\n\n\nWe follow the lines where the road leads us\n\n\nThere's\
  \ a long way \nA long way to go...\nAround the World\nThe true word has many meanings\n\
  \nLOVE\n\nI came here to learn how to live\nInside me there is an immense cosmic\
  \ will \nA big interstellar space searching\n\nYour eyes \nAre a deep sea of summer\
  \ fires\nAnd Everywhere I go\nI look for Them\n\n....\n\nThere is no plain to take\n\
  These moments away from us\n\nI love you\n\n...\nCROSSROADS OF FATE\n...\n\nThings\
  \ change\nPeople change\nSeasons changes\nLife changes\n\nWhat were The chances\
  \ ? The probabilites\n\nI know your heart\nI know\nI know you can\nI believe in\
  \ you\nCourage \nEnergy\nStrenght\n\n(Es muss sein)\n\nI Am going to live anyhow\n\
  \n(I am going to be happy... Maybe..)\n\nRUNAWAY\nRUNAWAY\nRUNAWAY\n\nFLY\n\nGO\
  \ INTO THE WILDS\n\nDISCOVER\n\nwhat truly matters\n\nclear Sky, Water, Earth and\
  \ sun\n\nThere is no DEPRESSION\n\nNO ANXIETY\n\nYour Body is your body\nYour will\
  \ is your will\nYou are free\n\nThe Wind will guide you\n\n(Don't give up)\n\nLife\
  \ is what you make of it\nLife is what you do with what you are given\nA step is\
  \ not just a step\nA step can not be just one more step\n\nOn The road, trying to\
  \ understand color\n\nThe clouds look like something I Dreamed of\n\nOne Day....\n\
  \nOur time will end\nThere wiil be no tomorrow\nWe die.\n\nGifts are ungiven\nSwords\
  \ are shattered\nThe smoke vanishes\nThe stars fade\n\nThe body fails\n\nAfter everything,\
  \ what stays ?\n\nof the essence?\n\nYour name?\n\n\nLeoa Concha Branca\n\n Remember?\n\
  \nOur adventures\nThe beach that turned desert\nThe fire that fell off\n\n- Why\
  \ girl -\n\nAfter all this time\nhow can the travel tear us apart? \n\nDISTANCE\
  \ is bigger than a thousand years of despair\n\nSOLITUDE is a wall made of lost\
  \ conversations\n\nSilence is void of silence\n\nAnd The idyllic can never be forgotten\n\
  \n...\n\nDanger Danger\nThe machine is overheating\nBut the car must keep going\n\
  Untill we get there\n\nPeople come\nPeople go\nAnd so does The tide\nBut do we...\
  \ Do we follow?\n\nThe road Goes as The road Goes\n\nTrue Friendship lasts forever\n\
  True love has no limit\nSo we Said\nSo we thought\nBut MAYBE your are busy now\n\
  \nIs there sill time?\n\nI Wish you were here\nI love you\nI miss you\n\nError!!\
  \ Error!!! The system Does not compute\nThe material reality breaks\nLife colides\
  \ with the dream\n\nThe river parts its ways\n\nAnd since we can run no longer against\
  \ it\nWe let go\nSo the horizon can rise"
