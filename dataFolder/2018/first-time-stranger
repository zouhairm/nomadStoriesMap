Text: "I had never really felt like a stranger before. Not in the Philippines, not\
  \ in Russia, not even in China. I was a stewardess at the time, flying as I would\
  \ ride the subway. I had always found a way to relate to a place and its people.\
  \ But this night in Japan, trapped in the overcrowded futuristic streets of Osaka,\
  \ filled with giant illuminated billboards, I was brought back to my most childish\
  \ state. \nI had taken the hotel shuttle to the main station. After wandering through\
  \ a giant electronic shopping mall, it was late already and I decided to return\
  \ to the hotel. But I stepped out in a huge crowd marching quietly in the opposite\
  \ direction. Surprised, I decided to follow. I was the only foreigner and everyone\
  \ was glancing at me, perplexed. A Policeman, guiding the crowd with phosphorescent\
  \ sticks, noted my intrigued look and mimed a firework with his hands. \nAfter a\
  \ half-hour walking, we heard the distinctive firework's sounds. I couldn\u2019\
  t even see the show before its end. Then, faster than I could realize, everyone\
  \ was gone. I was standing alone in a square surrounded by midsized tiled buildings.\
  \ It hit me: I had nothing to find the hotel. No map, no address. My phone\u2019\
  s battery was dead. I found three students speaking English who happily escorted\
  \ me to the central station. \nThe shuttle service was finished. I just had in mind\
  \ the name of a station I had overheard the captain speak about. It was my best\
  \ shot. I entered in the station to find myself in front of a huge subway map in\
  \ Japanese. The English language wasn\u2019t available at the vending machines.\
  \ A man eventually understood the name and got the ticket for me. I felt as a child,\
  \ unable to read and to understand anything, completely dependent on others. \n\
  After the train ride I emerged in an empty industrial area. After five minutes cogitating,\
  \ I saw a woman walking peacefully on the sole street. I approached her. She didn\u2019\
  t speak English but I somehow told her I was looking for a hotel close-by. I understood\
  \ she would show me the way to some place. We walked for fifteen minutes and managed\
  \ to talk, although we had no language in common. I had almost forgotten my concerns\
  \ when I noticed a building that resembled my hotel. My impression was confirmed\
  \ as we came closer. \nI thanked the woman who politely declined my invitation for\
  \ a drink. I felt so relieved, I was home ! \nThat night I humbly learned that you\
  \ can be a stranger in any place. And that you must always have the address of your\
  \ place."
