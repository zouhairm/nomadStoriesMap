Text: "We all fall in love. And when we do, we wish it lasts for eternity. And then\
  \ destiny strikes. Or Gaud\xED, in my case. \u201CPlace free?\u201D he asked, in\
  \ broken English, with his eyes scrunched up, protecting them from the sharp Catalonian\
  \ sun. He squatted next to me, so close it made my jaw stiffen. I had chosen the\
  \ least comfortable spot in the whole of Park G\xFCell, but it allowed you to see\
  \ Barcelona in front of you, just like a snowflake caught on a teaspoon. Dami\xE1\
  n, as he introduced himself, had a wild looking dog with him, a cross between a\
  \ wolf and a German Shepard, called Lobo, as I later learnt.  Dami\xE1n's eyes are\
  \ one of those colors you can never quite describe, something between eucalyptus\
  \ and pine green, ocean deep. He could be from anywhere - he has long, strawberry\
  \ blonde hair, casually braided to one side, yet pitch black eyebrows and eyelashes.\
  \ He looks like one of those 'ideal men' women compose from actors and singers.\
  \ My head is running wild. I cannot place him. He fishes a foam ball from his navy\
  \ blue pants, throwing it towards the chubby palm trees on the left. Lobo's rapid\
  \ start leaves us coughing, with the thick, orange dust slowly settling down on\
  \ our bodies. I nervously try to protect my laptop.\u201CYou write?\u201D he asked\
  \ again, sending those imaginary butterflies fluttering down my throat. Few hours\
  \ later, the sun begins to hide behind the mosaic chapel underneath us, greedily\
  \ taking its last rays of heat away. I wish there was an explanation for me to be\
  \ curled up in the arms of a stranger, whose words I cannot understand and face\
  \ I cannot recognize. I wish I could go home and forget his lips on my ear, gurgling\
  \ a sad melody I cannot comprehend. I wish I stayed in my tiny apartment today and\
  \ wrote about the 'Decision that pushed me to the edge', hoping to be selected for\
  \ this scholarship. I was expecting many things, when I moved to Barcelona last\
  \ year. I was expecting new, rich friendships, a warmer life and never-ending beach\
  \ picnics with my boyfriend, who I came to this magical city with. We were so in\
  \ love back then, I would wake up early and stare at him sleeping. I would prepare\
  \ jam\xF3n sandwiches for him and then carry them on my tiny bicycle across the\
  \ Gothic neighborhood to his office, freezing, surrounded by its stone cold walls.\
  \ I would scream so loud glasses broke when he proposed. With a diamond ring so\
  \ beautiful I could stare at it for hours, without blinking. \nThe last thing I\
  \ expected was to meet someone who made me hide that ring."
