Text: "Last year, I completed a six-month study abroad in Morocco.  I met two very\
  \ interesting people on the train. The first person was an older gentleman my friend\
  \ and I met our first day in the country. Both my friend and I were extremely jet\
  \ lagged and fell asleep on a train from Casablanca to Fez. For the first hour or\
  \ so of the train ride we had our own cabin, but as the trained filled a family\
  \ joined us. They are talking to each other in their native tongue, when the nice\
  \ old man, with only a few teeth left to his name and in the traditional Moroccan\
  \ covering called a Jalaba, offered me a tangerine. I accepted and it was the best\
  \ fruit of any kind I have ever tasted. Full of flavor and juice it gave me new\
  \ life and I was able to hold a conversation with the family. I did not know enough\
  \ French or Arabic to speak for myself, but luckily the daughter spoke broken English.\
  \ Translating for both me and her father. The man is obviously cracking jokes and\
  \ even points to me and says I look a little like him. I was flabbergasted, I never\
  \ thought I looked like a Moroccan, but nevertheless I enjoyed the compliment. After\
  \ about an hour of back and forth, the nice family disembarks off the train and\
  \ we said our goodbyes. That experience has and will continue to stick with me for\
  \ the rest of my life, and it is a testament to the Moroccan peoples' generosity\
  \ and kindness.  \n\nThe second person that I met was a young man about my age on\
  \ my way to Casablanca for the weekend. This was the first time I was traveling\
  \ completely on my own and I was exhausted from the four-hour train ride. Close\
  \ to the end of my journey, this man enters my cabin and is silent at first. We\
  \ exchange hellos and we begin to make conversation. In my mind he looked a lot\
  \ like a Moroccan version of Dave Franco and I was intrigued on what he had to say.\
  \ I do not remember his name, but he was an engineer going to Casablanca in hopes\
  \ of finding a job. He spoke perfect English and he was asking where I was from\
  \ and why I was here. I told my story and, why I was going to Casablanca. He then\
  \ asked me if I was religious and I said no but I was curious about other religions\
  \ outside of Christianity. He then begins to tell me everything about the Quran\
  \ and the meanings behind the passages. I chime in with some knowledge I have and\
  \ we engage in a little debate. He taught me many things I never knew and from that\
  \ new-found knowledge I gained much more respect and understanding of Islam."
