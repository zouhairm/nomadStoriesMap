Text: "\u201CWho made you so beautiful?\u201D; \u201CIt was God!\u201D - answered\
  \ the boy. It's Sunday morning, I wake up with the sun kissing my face and I go\
  \ and wash it in the tank with water for the day. Suddenly, I see a little boy hanging\
  \ around with a charming smile that overflows with simplicity. With the innocence\
  \ of a four-year old, he seems embarrassed. The happiness of this barefoot boy moves\
  \ me. \nIn August 2000, with six more young volunteers, I go to a mystical African\
  \ country (Sao Tome and Principe). At school, I teach the \u201Csubtraction\u201D\
  \ to second-year students. One day one of them realizes that I don\u2019t have a\
  \ rubber so he sneaks out of the classroom, runs about a mile to his house, returns\
  \ to school with a surprising perfumed rubber and says in an apologetic tone: \"\
  I just don\u2019t want you to lack anything.\" I was so moved by his concern that\
  \ I couldn\xB4t scold him, and I kept on reflecting on his words\u2026 The immense\
  \ desire   these children have to learn leaves us speechless. They really fight\
  \ for their dreams and life goals. Although they feel that some dreams could be\
  \ difficult to realize, they do not give up despite the difficulties. However, it\
  \ has its downs too. One afternoon, a young woman with a baby on her lap violently\
  \ tells me: \u201CHere, take him to Portugal! He's beautiful, isn\u2019t he?...\
  \ Now he is yours!\u201D I was shaking. She was offering me the son! She looked\
  \ desperate. And now I was too!\nSeptember 9, I feel feverish. It's five o'clock\
  \ in the morning, I hear the rooster crow, the church bell ring, and the sun is\
  \ already bright. I rise, I cross the mosquito net that covers us all, I get up\
  \ from the floor and... I lose my senses. I have malaria. Concerned as a family,\
  \ my friends make me laugh but I also hear them praying for me. Everyone shows their\
  \ affection: offering me flowers, their best bunch of bananas, teaching me to gnaw\
  \ sugarcane when I am thirsty. It fascinated me how generous these people were and\
  \ how detached they were of material things. I visit a blind woman who gets by alone\
  \ in a wooden house. As soon as she hears the guitar, she starts singing. My intention\
  \ is to encourage her, but her impressive strength and cheer encourages me.\nBefore\
  \ this experience, I considered myself rich and happy. Unexpectedly, In Africa I\
  \ discovered my poverty. How surprising life is! I traveled with the intention of\
  \ teaching, of giving, but I returned with the certainty that I received and learned\
  \ much more in this archipelago... without water, without light... with everything!"
