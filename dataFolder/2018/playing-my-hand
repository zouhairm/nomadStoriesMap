Text: "I was sitting on a promenade with my back to the city, as I closed my eyes\
  \ and felt the wind against my face. Mindful that this moment would be over soon\
  \ & I would have to go back to my regular life. I breathed in the crisp sea air\
  \ as droplets of water landed on my arms when the waves crashed against the jagged\
  \ rocks of the Promenade Beach at Pondicherry. I felt zen.\nIt had been two days\
  \ of exploring the cross-cultural union territory and I have to say, it's one of\
  \ the best places in India. Narrow streets lead to wooden doorways with yellow ochre\
  \ walls, decorated in foliage. Blue and grey buildings dot the French Quarters.\
  \ By simply taking a stroll or cycling down the alleys, you are transported to a\
  \ foreign lane. The last thing anyone would expect when they visit this Indian city\
  \ for the first time is for it to be so incredibly whimsical and French.\nMy friends\
  \ and I started our morning with a visit to Auroville, A universal township where\
  \ people irrespective of their culture and countries live in harmony. As we entered\
  \ the town, the path led us to a green trail from where we walked for a while until\
  \ reaching the Matrimandir, A magnificent golden edifice of spiritual importance.\
  \ The rest of the day was well spent exploring and sampling authentic French delicacies.\
  \ Our day ended with a touch of the proverbial French romanticism when we strolled\
  \ down the Promenade beach just as the last rays of the sun setting bathed the city\
  \ in a red and orange glow.\nWhile looking over the sea, I was unaware of a certain\
  \ change that was taking place. From the corner of my eye, I glanced towards my\
  \ friends and noticed they were getting their palms read by a woman. \n\"Come on\
  \ Ananya. Try it.\" My friend snapped me from my thoughts.\n\"But, I don't believe\
  \ in it.\"  I said peevishly. I looked at the Palmist who had shown up where I was\
  \ sitting, contently mulling over my thoughts.\n\"Don't be a spoilsport.\" She urged\
  \ me. I fell into the inevitable trap of succumbing to peer pressure & let the palmist\
  \ take a peek at my hands and decide my fate based on a few lines and shapes. The\
  \ last thing I expected to hear from someone was how I'd get into not one but two\
  \ major road accidents in my life. Deciding to take whatever she said with a grain\
  \ of salt, I wondered what went into the process of palm reading. The news of my\
  \ inevitable 'misfortune' did not deter me. It challenged me to find happiness in\
  \ travel. The day made me fall in love with the sea. It made me fall in love with\
  \ Pondicherry."
