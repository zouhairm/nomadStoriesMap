Text: "Icy winds whipped at our faces on top of the Mid-Atlas mountains in central\
  \ Morocco. From Azrou, we slowly pedaled through cedar forests, stopping to marvel\
  \ at the Barbary apes that live among the trees and snow. As we cycled on, the forests\
  \ faded into a white, empty expanse. The sun hung low on the horizon, and we scanned\
  \ for a sheltered area to camp. With the only trees far off in the distance, we\
  \ settled for a muddy clearing near the road. \n\nAs we unloaded our bags, someone\
  \ whistled at us from above. Three figures waved, inviting us up the hill. They\
  \ carried our bicycles into the main bedroom of their adobe hut and ushered us into\
  \ the sitting room. They insisted that Joe and I sit on cushions closest to the\
  \ wood stove, and they poured us glasses of hot, syrupy tea. Huddled together by\
  \ the fire, we shook hands, and Mohamed introduced us to his father and younger\
  \ brother. We spoke a jumble of English, Spanish, French, and Arabic, substituting\
  \ hand gestures when words failed us. With our basic vocabulary, we shared the story\
  \ of our bicycle trip\u2014the journey from Europe to Morocco\u2014and answered\
  \ questions about our lives. \n\nMohamed started to prepare a tagine, meticulously\
  \ washing and peeling vegetables. I asked Mohamed who taught him how to cook. He\
  \ explained that he learned during his service in the military. He found a plastic\
  \ binder and pulled out photographs taken while he was on duty: Mohamed in his uniform\
  \ standing in a field of flowers, sitting on a throne, smiling next to his bride.\
  \ After traveling with the military, he was content to be back. Although it was\
  \ not much, it was home. \n\nWe crowded around the table when the tagine was ready.\
  \ Using bread as our utensil, we ate savory chunks of beef and vegetables from the\
  \ communal dish. After dinner, we sat exhausted and sated. Mohamed's brother began\
  \ to sing a famous tune from the region. He closed his eyes and bobbed his head,\
  \ consumed with the rhythm in his head. I responded with a french lullaby, and we\
  \ continued exchanging a Moroccan song for a French one. Finally, exhausted of songs\
  \ and stories, Mohamed prepared cushions and blankets for us to sleep. Outside the\
  \ wind howled. My heart swelled with gratitude for the generosity of our unexpected\
  \ hosts. Headlines and well-meaning friends warned us about the dangers facing us\
  \ in Morocco. Instead, we found unparalleled hospitality and kindness. This is how\
  \ we change these misconceptions: one friendship at a time, making the vast world\
  \ a little more familiar."
