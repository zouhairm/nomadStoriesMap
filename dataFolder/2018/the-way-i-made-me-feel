Text: "The first steps were the hardest. \nThe path wasn't steep,nor was it dangerous\
  \ or something. It was just the amount of mud I was stuck in that made it hard to\
  \ walk. I even got the feeling to be lost at some point because I seemed to be in\
  \ the middle of a pond. \nBut then I saw them,tourists,walkers,merrily hiking on\
  \ that sunny Bank Holiday.\nI didn't even know what Bank Holiday was until that\
  \ day and I didn't properly understand the privilege of having such warm temperatures\
  \ in May in the Lake District. To me that was just a less-wet day of sun in which\
  \ I could enjoy some nature and finally stay outdoor. \nI hurried to follow them\
  \ because I wasn't really sure I knew where to go. Right and left,turn and straight,up\
  \ you go,these were the only directions I got from the woman at the caf\xE9,who\
  \ was pretty excited about offering to the Italian girl information and a delicious\
  \ scone,with jam and cream,of course. \nAnd there I was,on the Catbells Lakeland\
  \ Walk. And after an hour of climbing a green mountain ridge was in front of me.\
  \ All around I could see the blue of the lakes at the feet of the mountain slopes.\
  \ And as I was taking a breathtaking picture as everyone else on the summit I felt\
  \ like I was not really getting the best from that place. Something was missing.\
  \ I kept on walking,reached the end and rewarded my walking day with a meatpie and\
  \ beer at the Dog and gun in Keswick.\nI wasn't really looking like a lady at now,sweat\
  \ in a pub,looking at my refelction on the glass of my ale. I was answering some\
  \ clients' questions,clearly interested in what a young girl was doing all alone\
  \ in that place on Earth.\nSuddenly I got the idea. Was it the fresh flavour of\
  \ the hop that reminded me about the things I really liked? Well,I don't know. But\
  \ I went out of the pub with a plan.\nThe moon was still in the sky as I got out\
  \ of bed the day after. The air was pink and some sort of lilac and smelt like some\
  \ scent I didn't know. I took a deep breath and tried to feel like a book heroine.\
  \ And started running. I have always liked that feeling of freedom you've got when\
  \ you run in the early morning,like you're stealing time from the rush of the day.\n\
  The shoes sank in the mud,stepped on the grass,tapped on the ground. Step after\
  \ step,following the uphill path. I could hear my heart beating faster and my face\
  \ dripping gently. \nAn effort.\nAnd there I was. I was there. Just me and the silence\
  \ of the mountain,downing. And I felt insanely alive. I took a step.\nThe last step\
  \ was magic."
