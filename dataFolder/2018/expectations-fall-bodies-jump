Text: "I look at this little notebook that is now filled with thoughts, fears, lists\
  \ and wishes from over two years. My sister gave it to me as a gift from Tel Aviv\
  \ and it instantly evoked all the feelings and the atmosphere this city gave me\
  \ when I was there. On the reverse \u2013 or the front page, as I assume because\
  \ of the other reading direction in Hebrew \u2013 there is a picture showing Miriam\
  \ Weissenstein in 1941 while she is jumping in the air with bended knees, her hair\
  \ flying around her head with a natural smile on her face. In the background you\
  \ can only see sky, except of a lining of the scenery of the city at the bottom\
  \ of the page. It is exactly the image I have in my heart which was so different\
  \ to what I expected arriving there: More sky than city, more horizon than in cities\
  \ where you have the feeling that the streets carry on endlessly like for example\
  \ in Berlin and more dancing bodies than you can wish for. \n\nEvery day my friend\
  \ and I were walking from Levinsky Market to the Suzanne Dellal Center for Dance\
  \ and Theatre to get to our dancing classes with the feeling that around every corner,\
  \ behind every market where nuts or colourful plastic animals were sold, the sea\
  \ will emerge right away. When we finally entered the square in front of the theatre,\
  \ with a little ice cream shop at the corner and the spread palm trees surrounding\
  \ us, we instantly felt invited to dance. The ground of the square was of a smooth\
  \ marble surface reflecting the sun. Besides this yellow colour as well as pomegranate\
  \ juice, my main conjunction is dance. The extensive amount of great dancers I read\
  \ about that emigrated to Palestine, later Israel, the dancers of the famous Batsheva\
  \ Dance Company and the dancers in bars, clubs and street corners all around the\
  \ city.\n\nOn the one hand, my expectations were answered, seeing the people of\
  \ different religions on the streets as well as the ubiquitous presence of women\
  \ and men of the military. Contrary to these expectations, this aureate city shows\
  \ its force and political tensions not only in confrontation, but also or instead\
  \ within their attitude in dance \u2013 in a wild consistent gaze, in high jumps\
  \ and a down-to-earth connection through their legs. You can sense the urge and\
  \ fight to move freely and fearlessly through out the city. I remember exactly seeing\
  \ the shiny gold of the endless horizon over the Mediterranean Sea from the window\
  \ of the training studio \u2013 being everywhere and precisely in Tel Aviv at the\
  \ same time!"
