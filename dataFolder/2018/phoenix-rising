Text: "\"You can have these on one condition,\" my mentor, Phu, says- onyx eyes flashing\
  \ under warm lanterns.\n\"You must spin fire with me tonight.\" He exclaimed, laughing\
  \ away the doubt seeping through my expression. \n\nI looked down at my hands. My\
  \ palms cradled 5 handmade wicks- like cotton flowers with metal stems- made to\
  \ connect to my hula-hoop and set aflame in a celebration of dance.\n\nDoubtful\
  \ fireflies of \"never\" buzzed around my head. \nI've never done this before. \n\
  \nThen again-\nI'd never been out of the country before. \nI'd never traveled alone\
  \ before. \n\nYet here I stood, a solo, female traveler.  An American farang on\
  \ the cobblestone streets of Pai, Thailand. This is what I had asked for: to play\
  \ with fire. \n\n\"I can feel it in you,\" he insisted: \n\"You have a fire in your\
  \ soul that must be matched, you are ready\"\n\"Okay,\" I conceded, \"Where and\
  \ when?\"\n\nAt sunset, I gathered travelers from my hostel and told them of my\
  \ plan to spin fire. Met with a mixture of confusion and excitement, I found myself\
  \ leading an ex-patriot pod across dark bridges and silent roads to a bar amusingly\
  \ named \"Don't Cry\". I clutched my clear, plastic circle and inspected it for\
  \ sturdiness, mentally rehearsing my movements and emergency plan.\n\nPhu was a\
  \ lithe, wily fire-master. His enthusiasm emulated the flame. He had been spinning\
  \ fire for ten years throughout Thailand. Travelers and locals alike traveled to\
  \ Pai to attend his fire trainings.\n\n\"Fire spinning is an art in Thailand,\"\
  \ he explained. \"I came here from Burma for freedom, and fire gave me that.\"\n\
  \nHe showed me how to dip the wicks in kerosene, and lit them with an unconscious\
  \ flick of his wrist. I was the swollen cotton- saturated with experience and knowledge,\
  \ ready to be set ablaze. \n\nA sacrifice to the flame, I stepped into the circle.\
  \ Engulfed in foreign cheers and blurry faces, I began spinning.\nI was the phoenix,\
  \ wings outstretched, lost in the vortex. Reborn through experience, trust, connection.\
  \ Eventually the wicks subsided and I surrendered the stage once more to Phu to\
  \ a sea of muted cheers.\n\n\"Good, now do it again\" he instructed. And again,\
  \ and again, until I had lost myself fully. \n\n\"I won't always be here to guide\
  \ you\" he said at the end of the evening, \"You must master the fire on your own.\"\
  \n\nAs he leapt once more into the crowd, I watched in awe of his freedom. I stood\
  \ silently in gratitude, for he had given me mine."
