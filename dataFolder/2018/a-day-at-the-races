Text: "Sumbawa is between Bali and Timor. It\u2019s hot and dry, with very few tourists\
  \ but some of the best surfing anywhere.\nMy surfing friend Umar convinced me a\
  \ day at the races would be fun. Eddie was my guide as Umar had race preparations.\
  \ \nFor the long road trip, I felt bummed about a day away from perfect waves. I\
  \ didn\u2019t feel like small talk with Eddie, but he was excited.\n\u201CBig races\
  \ Mr David. Many famous horses.\n\u201CIf Umar wins, first prize is TV!\n\u201C\
  In Bali, they call our ponies \u2018bonsai horses.\u2019 But you should see jockeys!\u201D\
  \nDompu races was chaotic. Hot, noisy, busy. The thick smell of clove cigarettes.\
  \ Lots of race goers.\nMy T-shirt was drenched with sweat! But the locals looked\
  \ cool in batik shirts and Kufi hats. The women glamorous in hijabs and heels.\n\
  \u201CWhere\u2019s Umar\u201D I asked. \u201CAt owner\u2019s camp with Guntur (his\
  \ horse). Important horse and owner have strong partnership!\u201D\nThe track was\
  \ dusty. People everywhere. Chaos.\nThe marshals blasted their whistles, and chased\
  \ the spectators off the track with a swiping rattan.\nThe jockeys were tiny boys.\
  \ In stockings and bike helmets, they looked wide eyed.\nA loud shrill and the first\
  \ race was underway. The tiny jockeys held tight, a cane in each hand, rhythmically\
  \ slapping the horse\u2019s rump. What a spectacle! As the horses roared past, Eddie\
  \ yelled \u201CGuntur is Bahasa for thunder.\u201D\nAt the first corner, boys from\
  \ the crowd lept onto the track and caned their horse\u2019s. \u201CThey\u2019re\
  \ jockey\u2019s brothers. They do dangerous but important job\u201D explained Eddie.\n\
  The race was quick. On the last bend, a jockey was thrown from his mount. He landed\
  \ heavily, but was quickly to his feet, covered in dust. The horse just kept running!\
  \ Finally, trainer, jockey and horse were reunited with smiles all round.\n\u201C\
  Guntur in race 2\u201D said Eddie. \u201CThat rich guy wants to bet with you?\u201D\
  \ Behind sat Amir whom I\u2019d met surfing. He waved. \u201CMy father has 12 horses\
  \ racing today. His favourite Petir is racing against Guntur.\u201D\nEddie said\
  \ that Petir is Bahasa for lightning.\n\u201CMr David, bet Amir. Today, thunder\
  \ will beat lightning!\u201D\nRace 2 was more riotous confusion. Petir just beat\
  \ Guntur. Lightning beat thunder.\nAmir wouldn\u2019t accept the winnings. Instead,\
  \ he took us to the food stalls. \u201CGuntur raced well and won second prize\u201D\
  \ said Amir. \u201CIt\u2019s a satellite dish.\u201D\nI knew that Umar\u2019s home\
  \ was tiny. There was nothing electrical, no TV. I wondered what Umar would do with\
  \ a satellite dish.\nAmir read my mind \u201CMy father will give Umar first prize\
  \ as well. He already has too many TV!\""
