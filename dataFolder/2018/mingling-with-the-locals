Text: "The moment I arrived in Havana I could not wait to start exploring Old Havana,\
  \ I had everything planned. I read the guide thoroughly and I planned my day! My\
  \ walking map was marked with landmarks, piazzas, certain streets, and restaurants\
  \ for a whole day of walking and exploration. \nI arrived to Old Havana, equipped\
  \ with my map, camera and good spirits set off to my \u2018girl in Havana\u2019\
  \ exploration of the city. I got off at a bus stop that seemed to be in the middle\
  \ of nowhere, I could not recognise street or place that I knew from my prep work.\
  \  As I was walking and looking around for street names and trying to figure out\
  \ my map and where I was, I saw a smiling couple I smiled back and asked for help.\
  \ \nThey offered to guide me and started walking with me and said: \u201Cwhy don\u2019\
  t we take you to Che Guevara house where you can drink his favourite drink?\u201D\
  . Sensing adventure I quickly agreed! I followed my local guides through very dilapidated\
  \ streets and started to wonder whether this was a good idea. There were no other\
  \ tourists in sight and I had no idea which part of the city I was. \nAfter a short\
  \ walk we arrived at The Bar, the one deemed as Che\u2019s house and ordered drinks\
  \ that I insisted to pay for, since they offered me such a warm hospitality. I enjoyed\
  \ more chat time with the couple, not necessarily the drinks! I learnt a lot about\
  \ their daily struggles, earnings, and their day to day life. They didn\u2019t complain.\
  \ Although, they were poor financially, their spirits were happy and positive. And\
  \ this is the biggest lesson I learnt in Cuba. You don\u2019t have to have a lot\
  \ to be happy. \nOnce we finished our drinks I announced that I better get going\
  \ if I wanted to see all the beautiful places in Havana. The couple insisted they\
  \ will take me to one more place. In fact, they took me to an illegal shop that\
  \ was run at the back of the house, behind washing lines, well hidden in the backyard\
  \ of the old house. You could buy cigars, rum, and caned coke. I can only assume\
  \ they thought they are helping me to get a good deal as that\u2019s how their life\
  \ is; deals, swap of products, as there\u2019s shortage of everything in shops so\
  \ you must make it happen, however I kindly declined. If I was caught at the airport\
  \ with such products, they would have been confiscated and I\u2019d have been in\
  \ trouble! I said my good byes and thank them for short and wonderful time spend\
  \ together. I really enjoyed that local encounter and I remember this experience\
  \ as my \u2018mingling with locals\u2019."
