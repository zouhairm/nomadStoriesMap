Text: "It was as if the dead eyes of the fish head floating in the center of the soup\
  \ bowl were staring right at me. The word Ribbit came to mind, it\u2019s more of\
  \ a sound then a word really, the sound a frog makes to be precise. It was also\
  \ the code word my father had given me. This was in case I got kidnapped because\
  \ that happens over there. This was his concilation when he realized that he had\
  \ lost the war and I was going. At least we had a code word. Nothing was stopping\
  \ me, I was on the mend from a broken heart and this trip was my tincture. \n  \
  \  It wasn\u2019t easy, it took six months slaving away in a warehouse. Mandatory\
  \ overtime, sore muscles, and  frustrated bones. It led to plane tickets, a stop\
  \ over in London where I cried myself to sleep having for the first time felt completely\
  \ alone. It led to getting lost in Bangkok and loving it,  enchanting train rides\
  \ through rice paddy fields, solemn temples canvassed in hallowed chanting, learning\
  \ to communicate with hand gestures, frustration, relief, and now fish head soup.\n\
  \    In Chang Mai there was an event called Monk Chat, a clever concept where westerners\
  \ could meet with monks and learn about their lifestyle and the monks could practice\
  \ their English. This is where I met WeLai, over the course of several Sundays we\
  \ learned a good deal about each other. He was from Laos, and had come to Thailand\
  \ to attend the University so that he could better the lives of his family. I also\
  \ learned that he was concerned about his mother, who he hadn\u2019t heard from\
  \ in several months. This is what led me to a small hut in his village now filled\
  \ to the brim with people and his mother patiently smiling opposite me, and me nervously\
  \ staring down at a floating fish head. I thought of my fathers face looking down\
  \ at me when as a child there was a pile of uneaten peas in front of me. I grabbed\
  \ a piece of sticky rice rolled it up dipped it in the grey soup and swallowed it\
  \ down.  \n    In Thailand there\u2019s an expression, same same but different.\
  \ I'm not sure what any of us are really searching for when we travel. Maybe ourselves,\
  \ maybe the thread of humanity that deep down connects us all. Eventually you come\
  \ to realize the whole world over we\u2019re the same, only slightly different.\
  \ In the next city I found an internet cafe and emailed WeLai to let him know his\
  \ mother was healthy. I then emailed home and told my parents all about my trip\
  \ and the fish head soup, I ended the letter with Ribbit of course. It\u2019s still\
  \ my father's favorite story."
