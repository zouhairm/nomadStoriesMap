Text: "As the sun set slowly in the west, we were still walking down the roadside\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. No cars driving by, not a soul to be seen. I was holding\
  \ tight the piece of a carton with the \u201CBUDAPEST\u201D written on it, cursing\
  \ myself I let my friends decided to take the ride from the man who wasn\u2019t\
  \ going exactly in our destination. It is well known among hitchhikers to do anything\
  \ in order not to get stucked  in small cities in Slovakia. And yet here we were,\
  \ just 3 girls walking down the empty road, hoping we were heading toward highway.\
  \ I must say, view was incredible. Grass on fields were gently dancing, moved by\
  \ a warm wind. Small fawn gracefully run through The Green Sea just to disappear\
  \ in the dark forest. As we were walking another hour, feeling sweat under the heavy\
  \ backpacks, I had to sing \u201CHakuna Matata\u201D, which was the only way to\
  \ prevent my friend from crying and being more scared about what we\u2019ll do.As\
  \ the car came around the corner, we lifted our thumbs, brought back big smiles\
  \ on our faces, having all our hopes in that slowly-driving, grey car, which at\
  \ that moment seemed to move even slower that it actually was. When he stopped next\
  \ to us, I saw 2 people inside- driver who was a 40-looking man, and in the similar\
  \ age woman. Man jumped out of his car, looked at us and just started laughing.\
  \ He had something, which made us trust him. As he put our backpacks inside the\
  \ trunk, we got in and woman started talking to us, about how she and her husband\
  \ used to hitchhike when they were younger and how many people had helped them,\
  \ so they wanted to return the favor. Man introduced himself as Daniel and woman-Victoria.\
  \ When Daniel found out we are from Poland he was extremely pumped. \u201CI love\
  \ polish movies! Especially Boys don\u2019t cry! Duck is the most you can achieve!\u201D\
  , and so it begun, whenever Daniel was talking to us, he was shouting some quotes\
  \ from polish movies so often, we got confused what he was actually saying.\u201C\
  Hey girls its really hot outside don\u2019t you think?\u201D he said while pulling\
  \ up to the small, old gas station.He jumped out of his car and run into the shop.\u201C\
  here you go!They were my favourites when I was a kid\u201D said Daniel and gave\
  \ each one of us a delicious, life-saver cold, chocolate ice cream.Again showing\
  \ us that altruistic people still exist in that cycle of fitting in a society.Those\
  \ kind of people, people willing to help you without any reason,makes you still\
  \ have hope,which you are loosing living in a big,always busy city."
