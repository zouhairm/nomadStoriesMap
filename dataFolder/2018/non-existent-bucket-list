Text: "As a line of bubbles travelled my way and the night air was turning with a\
  \ rainbow of colors suddenly, my eyes searched for the culprit of my teabreak disturbance,\
  \ but as soon as I as saw the little boy smiling and asking possibly every tourist\
  \ around \" Do you want my bubble makers, they are amazing, small prized at 10 RS\
  \ and bigger one at 20 RS\". With a smile etched on his face as he wandered to next\
  \ customer when one refused, I couldn't help but ask him what he did during the\
  \ day, \" Do you study?\" And as joyously as ever he replis \" Ha Didi(Yes Sister)\"\
  . And there started a long conversation which was filled with food, talks and later\
  \ selling bubblemakers with him. An incident that is etched in my life forever,\
  \ a person that matters to me so much, wouldn't have been possible in the first\
  \ place if not for a crazy bucket list of a crazy friend of mine. \nSitting there\
  \ on her bed making a non existent bucket list to be completed in two days before\
  \ her leaving the place for years to come,  the last thing I had in my mind  was\
  \ meeting beautiful strangers over the next two days...\nHunching a ride next morning,\
  \ researching, planning, bookings, crazyiness on the way as we sauntered to our\
  \ bucket list station."
