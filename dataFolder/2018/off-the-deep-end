Text: "I was about to embark on my first big international trip. My family hadn\u2019\
  t taken big trips growing up. I wasn\u2019t able to study abroad, and I\u2019d never\
  \ been outside North America. Moreover, just two years into my first real job with\
  \ limited disposable income, I wasn\u2019t sure I had the means to travel.\nThankfully,\
  \ a friend whose dad worked for a major airline was able to get me a standby ticket\
  \ at an affordable price. It was settled: I\u2019d visit my sister who was studying\
  \ abroad in Paris, and we would spend a long weekend in Amsterdam. The decision\
  \ to fly standby and its implications for the logistics of my trip forever changed\
  \ the way I\u2019d think about travel.\nOr rather, traveling in mid-June when flights\
  \ to Europe are jam-packed. Not a single standby passenger made it to Europe from\
  \ my airport that day. After having a friend introduce me to his Boston-based friend\
  \ with a spare bed, I jetted off to Bean Town, where I got to dine on some great\
  \ Italian in North End before finally making it on my flight to Europe.\nMy first\
  \ order of business upon arriving in Amsterdam was to convince a KLM agent to not\
  \ cancel my return trip to Paris for missing the first leg of my trip that morning.\
  \ After telling me that this was not how it worked, she issued my boarding pass\
  \ to Paris and I had a coffee just in time for my sister to arrive from Paris. It\
  \ all worked out, and I was hooked on triaging problems and planning on the fly.\n\
  After three days of exploring Amsterdam and five days of enjoying Paris, I was having\
  \ a coffee in the Marais thinking about what I might do that weekend, when I got\
  \ the text from my sister that she was headed to the bus terminal for her (pre-planned)\
  \ trip to London. I told her I\u2019d be joining her. After getting thoroughly lost\
  \ with an Uber driver (and apologizing in French, English and Arabic), I made it\
  \ to the terminal to board the bus 5 minutes before departure. I connected with\
  \ another friend of a friend to crash for the night, but when his roommate returned\
  \ for my final evening in Europe, I was back to planning on the fly. Finding myself\
  \ thoroughly homeless by 2:00am, I resolved that I would explore some of London\u2019\
  s 24-hour attractions before heading straight to the airport where thankfully I\
  \ was flying first class back to the US.\nNot only did this trip show me that I\
  \ could travel, it underscored that I enjoyed it, particularly planning on the fly\
  \ and calling an audible. As a result, I\u2019m more likely to stumble upon a great\
  \ spot or unique experience."
