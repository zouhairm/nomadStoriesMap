Text: "In the monastery down the street from my grandfather\u2019s house, there was\
  \ a courtyard filled with bonsai trees from the 1800s, carefully pruned and thriving\
  \ green in the humid open air of Saigon. I stood at the edge of this vignette framed\
  \ by colourful ceramic tiled gates depicting sooty dragons and chipped clouds. A\
  \ low-key heaven. My fingers wrapped around the iron gate bars vibrating with sounds\
  \ of midday street traffic, as I craned to see more. I was waiting for the Master\
  \ who had invited me for lunch, simply having agreed the day before to present myself\
  \ at 12:30. \n\nNo older than I, at 23, he was one of the monks hired to preside\
  \ over my grandfather\u2019s funeral. He had the face and build of a regional title-holding\
  \ athlete. Wrestler? Flyweight boxer? Turns out, he was just a healthy vegetarian\
  \ who did push ups. \n\nThere was to be no official business over lunch, between\
  \ the Master and I, just mutual curiosity\u2014I about his young monastic life,\
  \ and he about a visitor from overseas, an English speaker. My aunt had broken out\
  \ into giggles after he had ridden far enough away on his moped: the audacity of\
  \ this flirtation in the midst of funeral arrangements! Though On-Paper Prudes,\
  \ like everyone else in Vietnam, my family was wizened to the folly of the young,\
  \ and humanity of the heat.\n\nWhen the Master came for me, he simply bowed, the\
  \ muscles in his face long adapted to force solemnity. But, I grinned back ridiculously,\
  \ delighted to be led anywhere new, on this first trip abroad. I followed his fluttering\
  \ orange robes, through the lush forest of bonsai and whispers of monks relaxing\
  \ in the shade of the building as we passed: \u201COoh, who is THIS?\u201D \n\n\
  The Master led me to the administrative office with mahogany furniture topped with\
  \ stacks of paper anchored by stones, their corners flapping free in the cross winds\
  \ of three slowly turning fans. \n\nWe were immediately set up at a fold out table\
  \ with huge plates of rice, steamed spinach and tofu. I showed my gratitude by diligently\
  \ transferring the small hill of food into my cheeks. Capable of only a peculiar\
  \ mix of halting Vietnamese, mostly English, through my fingers, concealing my chews,\
  \ I listened instead, to the Master's mid-country accent.\n\nMonkhood was a good\
  \ path to care, discipline and education for children in the precarious economic\
  \ tightrope of existing. He was 15 when his family sent him here, he said. But now\
  \ as an adult, he's actively chosen this life. He paused to take a sip of water,\
  \ and smiled at me."
