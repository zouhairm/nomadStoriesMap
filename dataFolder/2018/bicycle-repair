Text: "With a pretty bad day behind me I sat in his bathroom that doubles as a kitchen.\
  \ He shouted something at me in Vietnamese. In a friendly kind of way. People in\
  \ Vietnam tend to raise their voice for a lot of occasions. He points at the washing\
  \ powder. I didn't get the hint so he grabs it and throws the powder over my hands.\
  \ The white powder looks funny on top of my dirty hands. I hold my hands under the\
  \ water. I try to get all the grease off, with no luck. The worst comes off though.\
  \ I look down, my white dress is no longer white, even my legs found a way to get\
  \ dirty. \nWhen I get up to get out I see how small his house is. Two by three meters\
  \ I guess, there's a single bed and the kitchen. The pavement is filled with motorbikes.\
  \ There is a small place in front of his door where there are no bikes parked. That's\
  \ where he sits. With my bicycle and a toolbox.\n\nIt was one of days ridiculously\
  \ hot days. My body was sweating from places I didn't know could sweat. The sun\
  \ was high in the sky. A rare sight in Hanoi. Usually the smog is so bad the sun\
  \ is well hidden. Today she was out and about. Not a good thing in a city such as\
  \ this one. \n\nAround ten minutes ago I was shouting at my bike, the chains kept\
  \ on falling off. I was on my way to see the temple of literature. Risking my life\
  \ in the heavy Hanoian traffic on a simple cycle. I put the chain back on my bicycle\
  \ several times already and I was ready to give up. When he grabbed me by my arm\
  \ I was just about to give my bike some well intended kicks. I turned to who-ever\
  \ grabbed my arm. A small Vietnamese man was standing there looking at me. He had\
  \ a kind face. Wrinkles that suggested he had a live filled with many smiles. Back\
  \ home I would've probably wondered what he wanted, but not here. Vietnamese people\
  \ tend to be genuinely kind. He pulled me towards his house and pointed at the bathroom.\
  \ After handing me the laundry powder he grabbed a small iron box underneath the\
  \ kitchen sink and took it to my bike.\n\nI sat on his \"porch\" when he was tightening\
  \ my chains. Making sure they wouldn't fall off ones again. When he was finished\
  \ he laughed at me, wiped his hands, lifted a teapot and poored me a tra da. We\
  \ sat next to each other in silence."
