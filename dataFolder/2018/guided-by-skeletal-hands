Text: "The morning is a blanket of bleak gray clouds. I\u2019ve done a poor job packing,\
  \ so I stand there, shivering in my thin windbreaker. I\u2019m alone, not entirely\
  \ sure which way I\u2019m headed. It\u2019s not exactly how I\u2019d imagined one\
  \ of the most profound days of my life beginning.\n\nAnd then I hear the bells toll,\
  \ as they have for over one hundred and fifty years. I follow the sound and eventually\
  \ reach Westminster Abbey. I went on a whim, the lone person on my trip who felt\
  \ that it might be worthwhile to wake up early and explore.\n\nI have no plan, no\
  \ expectations. I simply feel drawn to the history of the place. Unsure how to proceed,\
  \ I step up to a guard and ask, foolishly, \u201CIs poet\u2019s corner inside?\u201D\
  \ He replies with \u201CIt was this morning. I hope it\u2019s still there.\u201D\
  \ As I enter, I hear him repeat his joke to a coworker. I am a skilled source of\
  \ amusement.\n\nWestminster Abbey is an echoing masterpiece of a building, one usually\
  \ filled with tourists, but today, there is no one. I am entirely alone with my\
  \ thoughts. I step from one moment of history to the next--share an intimate silence\
  \ with Chaucer, contemplate existence with Queen Mary of Scots.\nWhat I was in no\
  \ way prepared for was to step onto the grave of Charles Dickens and immediately\
  \ begin to weep.\n\nSuddenly, the power of the written word strikes me in a way\
  \ I\u2019d never experienced. Here lie the bones of a man whose now-skeletal fingers\
  \ had long ago crafted words that had changed my life forever. In high school, I\u2019\
  d read A Tale of Two Cities and been heartbroken by its beauty. In high school,\
  \ I\u2019d torn through Dickens\u2019 pages and decided, \u201CI will be a writer.\u201D\
  \ He did that. He set me on that road. That man, here, beneath my feet. And he had\
  \ no idea.\n\nI have never been religious. I find it impossible to believe that\
  \ a divine being has set a path for me. And yet, as I stand there, something unfamiliar\
  \ washes over me. Years ago, I read a story, and that story led me here. In a way,\
  \ it shaped my fate. In a way, Dickens\u2019 hand plotted a course for me that I\
  \ was unable to waiver from. And suddenly the universe has a bit of meaning. I finally\
  \ understand that we all had the power to affect and guide one another. I will use\
  \ that power.\n\nI step out through the grand church doors filled with a purpose\
  \ I had not had when I entered.\n\nMy only regret is that I never did get to reassure\
  \ the guard that poet\u2019s corner was still where it had been when he last checked,\
  \ but, somehow, I don\u2019t think he\u2019ll mind."
