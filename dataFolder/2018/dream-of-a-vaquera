Text: "\u2018Sueno can smell it,\u2019 Adi threw his words over one shoulder as he\
  \ bounded ahead on a creamy Andalusian horse. I tried to ignore the emotion he alluded\
  \ to. Fear. A blanket of snow covered Spain\u2019s highest mountain range. My pounding\
  \ heart fell into a rhythm with my horse, Sueno, who weaved between rows of skeletal\
  \ cherry trees that led to the vanishing point of the sierra. \nOne hour earlier\
  \ I waited at Adi\u2019s front door. He answered with a grin, skin folds and smile\
  \ lines enveloping his eyes. Moments later he reappeared with his weathered riding\
  \ boots. A year had passed since our last ride but we spoke like old friends as\
  \ we saddled the horses. I could barely lift his father\u2019s saddle, heavy with\
  \ steel stirrups and the weight of tradition. \n\u2018My father was a vaquero,\u2019\
  \ Adi explained. \u2018A cowboy. If he belonged anywhere, it was on the back of\
  \ a horse. He galloped down these mountains with a lit cigarette between his teeth.\u2019\
  \ \n\u2018Just like in Sergio Leone films,\u2019 I said. \n\u2018I never saw those\
  \ movies,\u2019 Adi shrugged. \n\u2018Did you ever want to be a vaquero?\u2019 I\
  \ asked. \n\u2018When I was a child. But now I\u2019m just an industrial prostitute\
  \ who owns some horses.\u2019\nI didn\u2019t have to ask about Adi\u2019s line of\
  \ work. The open cut mine glimmered like a distant moon as I drove along the serpentine\
  \ road to his house. \nHe changed direction. \u2018Why did you come back to Spain?\u2019\
  \n\u2018It\u2019s a long story,\u2019 I said, and the words didn\u2019t come. I\
  \ watched the dying sunlight melt into the sierra like a burnt-out wick. \u2018\
  It\u2019s beautiful here,\u2019 I could only offer.\nAdi twisted his mouth and tilted\
  \ his head to the side. The look of polite disapproval.\n\u2018You don\u2019t think\
  \ so?\u2019 I asked.\n\u2018I do. But sometimes, the mountains close in on you\u2026\
  \u2019 He broke off his speech and a strange whistle rose from his mouth as if he\
  \ was being starved of air. \n\nMaybe we all want to run from something. I drove\
  \ to Madrid to escape a harsh winter. Then I kept driving south to escape the city.\
  \ I half-listened to the radio and made out a few words. 1978. Plaza de la Constituci\xF3\
  n. Rubber bullets. Crowd of protesters. When I passed through towns, flags were\
  \ draped from open windows high above the streets. \u2018Rivers of blood and gold,\u2019\
  \ said a stranger in Murcia, pointing to the colours of the flag. \n\nBefore I left\
  \ Adi, he played me an old ballad about men who loved the idea of the frontier so\
  \ much that they couldn\u2019t leave it alone. They destroyed it. I don\u2019t remember\
  \ the words but I know how it felt. The fear rises up your throat. We ride on."
