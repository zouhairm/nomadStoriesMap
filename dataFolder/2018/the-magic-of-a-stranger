Text: "My mind was so preoccupied with how to make Zoe\u2019s last night in Los Angeles\
  \ special that I\u2019d forgotten my precious ear buds. I felt vulnerable without\
  \ my tiny shields protecting me from human interaction while riding the metro this\
  \ morning as Max, the regular with the slick, silver ponytail and kind eyes plopped\
  \ down in the seat next to me. He wore a pinstriped suit far too big and was eager\
  \ to talk about football, so I obliged. Turns out Max was also performing at the\
  \ Magic Castle and offered me a coveted invitation to see him in action at the infamous\
  \ and exclusive, Magician\u2019s Clubhouse. \n\nThe striking, white Victorian-era\
  \ French chateau looked out of place nestled on a hill overlooking the busiest intersection\
  \ in Hollywood. The gridlock was worse than ever tonight but for once, inching one\
  \ kilometer in thirty minutes didn\u2019t bother me. Sure, my sweat was drenching\
  \ the snug suit I bought just for this occasion but I couldn\u2019t complain. After\
  \ all, I was on my way to a \u201Cmagic castle\u201D with the girl of my dreams.\n\
  \nThe walk along the red carpet out front was movie-premiere-worthy and we were\
  \ our own paparazzi, trying to capture the perfect selfie like our social media\
  \ lives depended on it. Gatekeeper to this palace of mystery and intrigue, a monstrous,\
  \ bronze owl greeted us atop the middle shelf of a mahogany bookcase. Its beady,\
  \ ruby gaze sharply contrasted with Zoe\u2019s sapphire eyes as I leaned toward\
  \ her while whispering the password into the winged beast\u2019s ear. As the aged\
  \ wood groaned, the cabinet slowly parted to reveal a hidden passage into the castle.\n\
  \nIt was as if we\u2019d stumbled through a portal to another era, with infectious\
  \ 1920\u2019s jazz roaring and the scent of old perfume in the air. We wandered\
  \ into a room where an intimate crowd gathered around a self-playing piano, hammering\
  \ out a version of \u201CLet It Be.\u201D The haunted piano would continue to take\
  \ song requests all night long from the rowdy guests.\n\nThe last show of the evening\
  \ starred Max and he selected Zoe to come up on stage, asking her to name any playing\
  \ card. He then unsheathed a long, thin sword and produced a deck of cards. As she\
  \ threw the deck high up in the air, he stabbed at the flourish of cards raining\
  \ down, piercing the sword through a lone card in one quick thrust. Revealing the\
  \ spiked card to be hers, Zoe shrieked in astonishment and ran off the stage into\
  \ my arms. She\u2019d go on to vanish from my life forever but thanks to Max, I\
  \ will forever remember the night when everything was real"
