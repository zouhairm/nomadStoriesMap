Text: "What I remember most is their wedding album. I can\u2019t remember their faces\
  \ or names, but I remember their photos. Generations from around the world filled\
  \ every frame of it, just as generations filled their home, which they graciously\
  \ opened to us. \n In 2015, at the start of the New Year, I went to Israel and the\
  \ West Bank. We arrived in Bethlehem on Orthodox Christmas Eve and snow was expected.\
  \ I came with a university program, and I was helping facilitate by taking photos\
  \ & video so that we would have our own album of memories. Moments like visiting\
  \ the Dome of the Rock and the Western Wall. \n My first dinner was with a local\
  \ family in Bethlehem, and it was a chance for me to be present without a lens.\
  \ Their home was perched on top of a hill, near the Church of Nativity, stacked\
  \ amongst many on top of one another. The family was generous and gracious. They\
  \ brought out their China & linens, and served Maqluba for a table of eight. Their\
  \ daughter graduated from Bethlehem University, and her husband was considering\
  \ an MBA in Germany due to border visas. A child and remodel was floated.\n We talked\
  \ about our lives - California, it\u2019s openness and ease. It\u2019s youth, built\
  \ on orange groves and freeways before retiring to coffee and Baklava around heat\
  \ lamps and Arab\u2019s Got Talent. Life at this moment was good, and their family\
  \ treated it with tenderness. Because 14 years earlier an Israeli tank shell had\
  \ burst through their home and exploded in that same room. That shell traveled through\
  \ their bedroom, their living room, and into the corner where their cabinet of China\
  \ stood. They were showered with drywall and anti-tank shrapnel. \n Their brother\
  \ could have picked up his ringing cellphone in that bedroom. Their father was about\
  \ to leave the T.V. to go downstairs. They both survived, and asked us why. We had\
  \ no answer. So we sat, looking through their wedding album; and, we left dinner\
  \ alongside other patched walls in Bethlehem, which those same shells had passed,\
  \ continuing on to meet others affected lives.\n The owner of Maxim\u2019s in Haifa.\n\
  \ The father of Tal Kehrmann on Bus 37.\n A memorial to Barusch Goldstein. \n How\
  \ each person organizes their own self-narrative is beyond difficult, but connecting\
  \ our lives in the moments between brings closure. Those are the choices we have.\
  \ What and how we choose to remember.  \n On our last day it snowed. We had Shabbat\
  \ dinner in the Old City, and the last photo I took was of children throwing snow\
  \ outside of Damascus Gate."
