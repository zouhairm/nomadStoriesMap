Text: "\u2018THE LAST THING I EXPECT\u2019\n \nWhat you can expect from a lunch at\
  \ your grandma\u2019s? I thought the same as you , a great meal time with my family.However,my\
  \ family was preparing a surprise for me . And after lunching they said some words\
  \ that I was expecting hear from a long time: you are going to travel abroad for\
  \ the first time.\n The place couldn\u2019t be different, Italy , the country where\
  \ my great grandparents met each other. My family always had the dream that someday,\
  \ some member of us would visit the place where all our story began.\nAnd 1 month\
  \ later , here we go .\n\nNovember 17th \nDay 1\n2p.m\nAfter 14 hours, I arrived\
  \ in Floren\xE7a. Unfortunely, I just had  8 hours in there cause I had to take\
  \ the train to my destiny , Montalcino. But I couldn\u2019t miss 1 minute in that\
  \ travel, so I enjoyed the city at most.\n10p.m\nAfterwards of a day full of historic\
  \ monuments and of course many pasta, I understood why I always loved that country.\n\
  \nDay 2\nBy morning I arrived in Montalcino , a commune in Toscana. As I only had\
  \ 2 days there, I used my first day to visit all the wineries and know a little\
  \ more of the town,visiting the museums and castles around .\n\nDay 3\n6a.m\nI woke\
  \ up with the sun, and I don\u2019t regret it. My hotel is localized in the highest\
  \ point of the city, so the sunrise couldn\u2019t be prettier. While I took my shower\
  \ I remembered something my grandma\u2019s used to say to me:the street where our\
  \ family used to live still the same. So why not search for histories they left\
  \ behind? \nLapine was the name, I called a cab and went there. It is a typical\
  \ street of an old and touristic town, full of antique and souvenirs stores. Although,\
  \ other thing distracted me, a wine store named  Prissinoti. I found it strange\
  \ cause it is my family last name. \nThe shop was full but I was able to saw a man\
  \ behind the balcony.  Half bald,and bearded .If wasn\u2019t for the beard I could\
  \ swear that that man was my father. I wanted to talk with him,however I waited\
  \ until the store close. By the end of the day I had many souvenirs and questions\
  \ on my bag. I went to the store and introduced myself . The man got impressed because\
  \ of my similarity with the rest of the family. And after some talk, we discovered\
  \ something that I would never expect: we were family! It happens that my great\
  \ grandfather had a daughter before wed and this man is half cousin of mine.\nAnd\
  \ after meeting my \u2018secret\u2019 family, I came back to Brazil with more than\
  \ just souvenirs in my pocket , but with many stories to tell."
