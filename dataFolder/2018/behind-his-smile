Text: "There I was, standing in front of my grandpa\u2019s grave. On a mountain in\
  \ rural Guangdong Province, suspended between a layer of thick fog, I watched as\
  \ my mother paid respects to her father. It was the first time either of us had\
  \ visited his grave or this town, but it was a town that was home to my grandpa.\n\
  \nI remember him as a man of few words. He spoke only Hakka Chinese which I don't\
  \ understand so our exchanges were short and helped by the wide smiles we shared.\
  \ But there was a lot of weight behind his smile. He had a family in Guangdong but\
  \ fled to Hong Kong fearing political unrest. Eventually, thinking that he would\
  \ never be able to return, he met my grandma and started another family\u2013my\
  \ family\u2013in Hong Kong. I knew that there were people in China with whom I shared\
  \ blood, but to me they were essentially strangers. I never met them and out of\
  \ respect for my grandma, didn\u2019t particularly want to. When my grandpa passed\
  \ away, we made arrangements for him to be buried in Guangdong beside his first\
  \ wife as he wished. But again, in consideration of my grandma\u2019s feelings,\
  \ we never visited his grave. It wasn\u2019t until after she passed away that we\
  \ felt it was finally time to visit him.\n\nThe 6 hour bus ride dragged on as I\
  \ tried to navigate my own emotions. What if these people who were supposed to be\
  \ my family weren't nice? Through them, would I learn anything bad about my grandpa?\
  \ With these thoughts churning in my head, the bus made its way to this town that\
  \ held so much significance to my family.\n\nThere, I learned more about my grandpa\
  \ than I ever anticipated. I learned about his will to survive. He was poor but\
  \ worked hard to earn money for his children so that they could go to school, walking\
  \ for hours to reach a market where he could sell his wares. We retraced his steps\
  \ on those unpaved streets, passing by farmers herding sheep, imagining what he\
  \ might have felt as he walked down them. We visited the home he lived in growing\
  \ up. Although now moss-covered and crumbling, we got to see remnants of him, seeing\
  \ his name etched onto the walls.\n\nAny apprehension that I felt about my 'new'\
  \ family members quickly dissipated. We shared a big meal of local food together\
  \ and they chuckled as we looked in awe at the plates of colourful braised meats\
  \ that were served. Then we cried together in front of my grandpa\u2019s grave,\
  \ announcing to him that we were finally here together like he would have wanted.\n\
  \nAnd as I stood in front of his grave reliving it all, I thanked him."
