Text: "-  This!\n\nI say, pointing at a random item on the menu. It's time for the\
  \ lottery, my best moment of the day. There are perks in being lost in translation\
  \ and one of them is that I can get good, unpredictable food.\nThe owner is staring\
  \ at me repeating the same sentence three times as if by exposition I could instantly\
  \ learn Korean and understand her; but we all do the same, don't we? \n\nWith a\
  \ smile, she grabs a piece of paper and writes 8:30. Ok, that's when I need to be\
  \ back and collect my dinner; it gives me a bit more to go around Gyeongju and have\
  \ a final look at the old capital with its temples, ponds and tumuli: burial mounds\
  \ under which are resting the once powerful kings of the Silla dynasty. Here Korea\
  \ took shape more than a thousand years ago.\n\nIt's my last evening here so I try\
  \ one of my favourite travelling hobbies: enter a takeaway and order something random.\
  \ With all these language barriers, the chance of actually getting what I want are\
  \ small anyway. I can dive into Korean food and be surprised by some dishes I would\
  \ never order on purpose. It's like hitchhiking or Couchsurfing, but with food.\n\
  \nWell, it's time; I receive my bag and I'm going to eat at the small hostel I checked\
  \ in. I'm the only foreigner: February is the low season so there are just local\
  \ families from Seoul or Busan visiting. \n\nI guess it must be something with chicken,\
  \ I can judge by the smell. Ha-yoon is in the kitchen as well, cooking while her\
  \ kids are playing. Time to unveil my dish of the day! And it's\u2026\n\nA chicken!\
  \ Yes, that's why it smelled like one. A full, plain grilled chicken. Just chicken.\
  \ I ordered the only thing I could have had home. \n\nI try to find some peculiarity,\
  \ some Korean hint in this bird but there's none: well', it's part of the game I\
  \ guess. I look outside to a tourist billboard and its motto: \"Gyeongju: expect\
  \ the unexpected\". Yes, of course. Seriously. How ironic.\n\n- You got some chicken,\
  \ I see. \n- Yes, Ha-yoon. I'm not going to have it all. Would you like to share?\n\
  - Sure, maybe I can trade with some of the Jajangmyeon I'm cooking.\n\nAn interesting\
  \ development.\n\n- It's a base of noodles topped with\u2026\n- No please, don't\
  \ tell me. I like the taste of surprise.\n\nI look out again to the tumuli of the\
  \ Silla Kings, wondering if there was Jajangmyeon back in their time, and further\
  \ into the dark Korean night. So dark it could be a night in any other corner of\
  \ the world, to be honest. Luckily, the smell of Asian spices is there to remind\
  \ me where I am."
