Text: "It all seemed like such a good idea at the time. But that was before the endless\
  \ climb. Before the unforgiving stone bed. Before the thundersnow.\nI had no one\
  \ to blame but myself, and nothing left to do but count the seconds between lightning\
  \ and thunder, my mortality suddenly and totally realized as the hail began to fall,\
  \ furious from an angry peak, the violence stopped just inches from my face by a\
  \ millimeter of plastic.\n\u201CGranite,\u201D I had been informed just hours before,\
  \ \u201Cis a wonderful natural conductor of electricity. That\u2019s why so many\
  \ of the trees here are fried.\u201D\nLightning illuminated the manic sky. I shut\
  \ my eyes and waited for the booming gauge of proximity to sound.\n\u201COne-Mississippi,\
  \ two-Mississippi, three\u2026\u201D\nWhen I had been invited to climb Mount Whitney,\
  \ I thought it would be a fun weekend with friends; a jovial campout. I volunteered\
  \ to bring paper plates.\nI\u2019ve always had a reverence for mountains, but, an\
  \ East Coaster born and bred, I had no true understanding of them. A recent California\
  \ transplant, I had even less familiarity with the Mighty Sierra, let alone their\
  \ crowning peak.\nAbout a week before the trek, I learned I had agreed to summit\
  \ the tallest mountain in the Continental U.S.\n\u201CEven better,\u201D I thought.\
  \ \u201CFortune favors the bold.\u201D\nUtterly unprepared for what lay ahead, I\
  \ had asked to borrow a sleeping bag from a friend. When the hulking thing arrived\
  \ at my doorstep, a day before the hike, I realized I would have to choose between\
  \ bringing it or my tent. There wasn\u2019t enough room in my pack for both.\nUp\
  \ at trail camp, 12,000 feet high, I foresaw a peaceful night beneath the stars\u2014\
  cold, maybe, but beautiful. Who needs a tent?\nThen the clouds turned a sickening\
  \ black. There was barely enough time to crawl under the rainfly that would make\
  \ the night\u2019s shelter.\nAs the hail grew heavier and the countdowns shorter,\
  \ I cried. Then, for the first time in my life, I prayed.\n\u201CDear God, I\u2019\
  m so sorry for my ignorance. If I live through this, I promise to never take your\
  \ Creation for granted again.\u201D\nThe storm lashed out until the morning call\
  \ to rise. Not that anyone slept.\nWe had 99 switchbacks and 2,500 feet to go, each\
  \ footfall of it iced over in the night, slick glass steps leading up a sheer precipice.\
  \ \nIt wasn\u2019t until the last of them flattened out at the summit that the magnitude\
  \ of what I had done set in. The clouds parted, and the awe of God\u2019s view washed\
  \ over all fears, all self-doubt as imperceptible as the details of the world below."
