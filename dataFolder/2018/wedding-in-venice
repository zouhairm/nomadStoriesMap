Text: "We were in 1995. I was 35 years old and my girlfriend was 30. We had been dating\
  \ for 15 years (with a break in between) and we lived together for 5 years. We were\
  \ very  passionate and happy. But we needed an adventure to maintain a healthy relantionship.\
  \ And what better adventure than to marry ... in Venice !? I looked at Z\xE9 (my\
  \ girlfriend) and said: What if we married? She: Marry!? For what? Are not we well?\
  \ Me: We are! But what if, we went to Venice ... to marry? She: Venice!? Ok, let\u2019\
  s do it! But how is this done? Me: I have no idea. I do not know anyone from Portugal\
  \ who has done this, nor do I know of any history. But I'll try to find out. 3 months\
  \ later, after much work in arranging the necessary documents, and with the help\
  \ of the consul of Portugal in Milan, we arrived, alone, in Venice on 10 August\
  \ 1995, two days before the wedding day. Meanwhile, the portugueses couple friend\
  \ who should have gone with us as witnesses had to cancel the trip at the last hour.\
  \ So, meanwhile, we had to find new witnesses there. Until the night before the\
  \ wedding day, we tried to find someone but we were not able to, until in St. Mark's\
  \ Square on the esplanade of Quadri caffee, on the table next to us was a French\
  \ couple laughing and drinking champagne. Z\xE9 looked at me and said: I'll talk\
  \ to them and tell our story, and I'm sure they'll agree to be witnesses to the\
  \ wedding. And she was right. They were surprised by the story and accepted the\
  \ invitation right away. In that moment we began to celebrate, precisely with champagne.\
  \ The next day we had a meeting on the place and went for the wedding that was scheduled\
  \ for mid-day. Z\xE9 was the bride, I was the fiance, the photo reporter and videographer\
  \ (all at the same time) and the French couple as witnesses (whose name I'd rather\
  \ omit because they were not really a couple because they were in Venice in a \"\
  sin\" weekend). It was a unique moment and also a little crazy because I had to\
  \ ask the several times to stop the ceremony so I could shoot the video. But they\
  \ were all very friendly and understood the situation because it is not every day\
  \ that someone goes from Portugal to marry in Venice. It's been 22 years and we\
  \ are still together and inlove, now with two children, and it is promised that\
  \ soon we will return. Although we tried several times, we never heard from the\
  \ French \"couple\" again. Maybe one day!"
