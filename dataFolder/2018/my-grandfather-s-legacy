Text: "The mythical Great Indian War. The freedom struggle of 1947. \n\nIndians\u2019\
  \ love for our homes and our homeland is as old as time itself. \nPerhaps it is\
  \ this love that took me to Shimla to visit the house that my great grandfather\
  \ built for his family in the 1920's. \n\nBut what I came away cherishing the most,\
  \ was his intangible legacy. \n\nGoing into an experience such as this, included\
  \ time travel. \n\nIt was no co-incidence then, that the house resembled a giant\
  \ Tardis! \n\nI saw the nearly hundred years old house standing tall and proud atop\
  \ a mountain like an old wise man. It was surrounded by pine trees. As if they were\
  \ sentries guarding a historical secret. \nWhat was this secret?\nI had to go inside\
  \ and find out!\n\nBut I forgot that time travel can be slippery! So was the narrow\
  \ path leading up to Firgrove Cottage (it is still known by its colonial name like\
  \ most buildings in Shimla.) This path was covered in moss and overgrown with wild\
  \ grass. It didn\u2019t help that it was the monsoon season. I had to use my umbrella\
  \ as a walking stick. Is this how those brave souls went up this hill too?\n\nAs\
  \ I stepped inside, time turned back (to when guests were treated no less than gods\
  \ in Indian homes!)\n\nA very simple family now lives in this house. I had no idea\
  \ what to expect. But the matriarch invited me inside and offered me, a complete\
  \ stranger, hot food within minutes of me having entered her house! Before I knew\
  \ it, I was enjoying the most flavorful and irresistible homemade rice and curry\
  \ with a generous pouring of clarified butter on top, served in an old-fashioned\
  \ brass plate! \n\nI imagined that this warm hospitality was from when my great\
  \ grandfather used to live here.\n \nHe was a simple businessman who opened the\
  \ doors of his house; this very house, to the freedom fighters who fought for India\u2019\
  s independence from the British. Mahatma Gandhi was one of his guests. \n\nThe romantic\
  \ in me wanted to believe that it was an act of dissent on his part, carried out\
  \ right under the noses of the colonizers. The British, who found the Indian summers\
  \ unbearable, made Shimla their summer capital, and called it Simla. And who wouldn\u2019\
  t feel at home among the pine-scented coolness of the Himalayas!\n\nAs I stepped\
  \ outside again, the setting sun had turned the air cold. A blanket of fog had descended\
  \ over the city below. But I could see that my great grandfather\u2019s legacy had\
  \ survived, even though spinning wheels and nationalistic jargon were no longer\
  \ needed."
