Text: "Standing at such a height, looking at the city. It looked so small up from\
  \ here. No people. Just buildings, highways, and houses people call home. Pink city.\
  \ The most underrated, beautiful, complicated city I ever traveled to. From the\
  \ chaos of Johri Bazar to the peaceful sunrises, here, at Nahargarh; this city gives\
  \ you everything it has. \n\n \u201CYou know, Rang De Basanti was shot here. That\
  \ jumping scene. I always loved it here. Have you seen the sunsets here? They are\
  \ beautiful. Sun painting fort and sky into different shades of happiness\u201D\
  \ \n\nhttps://scontent.fdel12-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/s2048x2048/28580390_1527523180679356_324935726_o.jpg?oh=026caf6684352013287f828862badb4e&oe=5A99BEDA\n\
  \nAzim. He spoke incoherently and too fast. \u201CLook at that building, yeah that,\
  \ it was my Grandfathers home. I always came and watch the sunrise here with him.\
  \ It was my favorite part of the day. During his teens, there were fewer rules.\
  \ He could sit here till night, and I am pretty sure, he jumped from here once.\
  \ Only if we could too\u201D \n\nhttps://scontent.fdel12-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/s2048x2048/28580222_1527519490679725_1139407680_o.jpg?oh=674dbfa9d597d40e1123be2c0697a3ea&oe=5A99DE75\n\
  \nThe freezing earthy breeze hit my face quite a few times, but city sparkled in\
  \ so many shades and colors. Standing here at the highest point didn\u2019t feel\
  \ dangerous or crush-worthy, it was calm. It made me calm. No one to judge or ask\
  \ questions about my identity or my caste. \nPeople didn\u2019t need introductions\
  \ here. They were their naked selves, only if you look at them long enough. Aza,\
  \ Isha, Sanjana. Three names. Three identities. Thousands of men. But here, only\
  \ Mohtarma(Lady). \n\nhttps://scontent.fdel12-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t35.0-12/s2048x2048/28555234_1527519420679732_325065275_o.jpg?oh=5779ffc81c6e36dfafc075c41be64dd0&oe=5A99C380\n\
  \nThousand of steps lead to the highest point of Nahargarh Fort. People rarely go\
  \ all the way up. \nThe city looks smaller and smaller the upper you go, houses\
  \ looking like mere land. \nSky nearer, heart beats faster. \nBrown walls standing\
  \ still after decades, reminding of the great warriors, who fought to save this\
  \ artwork, to save the dignity of their land, their culture. \n\nThe more dazzling\
  \ and quite the city is the more I lose myself in its serenity. \nThere's only me.\
  \ Just me."
