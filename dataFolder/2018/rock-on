Text: "\u201CYou can make a harness,\u201D Concho grinned.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t a suggestion.\
  \ We were at the base of a cliff, gearing up to climb.\n\nI was supposed to be in\
  \ Prague. But, a promise sealed with rakija \u2014 the Serbian answer to vodka \u2014\
  \ had sent me to Zaje\u010Dar, a town in eastern Serbia. With no published routes\
  \ and new climbs put up by locals, Zaje\u010Dar limestone was off the beaten path.\n\
  \nLooking up at the cliff, I let my gaze flow along the deliciously technical finger\
  \ holds. Still, my sense of self-preservation pulsed in counterpoint to the metal\
  \ blasting from Concho\u2019s speakers. The problem was, I only had my climbing\
  \ shoes. I\u2019d left the rest of my gear at home.\n\nApprehensively, I pulled\
  \ on Concho\u2019s extra harness and stopped: way too big.\n\n\u201CYou can make\
  \ a harness,\u201D he said.\n\nI could hear his amusement. I\u2019m okay with fun\
  \ and easy climbing, but Concho, a Zaje\u010Dar native, rocks the fierce independence\
  \ of the original Yosemite climbers. No harness? Make your own.\n\nHe carefully\
  \ laid out his gear on a tarp. Worn but serviceable slings in a jumble of colors.\
  \ Steel locking carabiners far heavier than the aluminum ones I\u2019d use. Lengths\
  \ upon lengths of cord. Pointing to a sling, he said, \u201CContraband from the\
  \ Alps.\u201D A carabiner, \u201CMy brother found it in France.\u201D The cord,\
  \ \u201CCan never have too much, right?\u201D\n\nYes, yes you can. I\u2019d never\
  \ seen that much cord in a climbing bag. But cord was cheaper than other gear. Far\
  \ from its dirtbag start, climbing now caters to weekend warriors with a bankroll.\
  \ Concho worked odd jobs to fund his climbing.\n\nHe wiggled his red climbing shoes,\
  \ \u201CNew from Italy.\u201D They finally cleared Customs after a month and were\
  \ too small, but the pain was worth it. \u201CI\u2019ll just climb faster.\u201D\
  \n\nI tucked my left shoe under my right, trying to not draw attention to how new\
  \ they looked. Or to think about how easy they had been to order online, on sale,\
  \ with two-day shipping.\n\nI picked through his gear and rigged a harness. Not\
  \ safe, but not unsafe.\n\n\u201CThis is ex-Yugoslavia not America,\u201D he laughed\
  \ at my qualms as he tied into his end of the rope. \u201CYou\u2019ll catch me?\u201D\
  \ I looked at the rope connecting us and at the one anchoring me to a tree.\n\n\u201C\
  In theory.\u201D\n\nRock on, he signed, smearing chalk war paint on his face. He\
  \ dusted his hands once more with chalk and flew up the climb. \n\n\u201CEasy?\u201D\
  \ I asked, lowering him. He gestured at me to continue until he lay sprawled out\
  \ in the mud.\n\n\u201CScared shitless,\u201D he responded, eyes closed and arms\
  \ crossed in a hug. \u201CI guess I trust your harness now.\u201D"
