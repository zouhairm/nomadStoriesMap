Text: "\u201CWalk with confidence, don\u2019t make eye contact, no stopping, no sudden\
  \ movements.\u201D I silently repeated these words, quickly trying to unlearn everything\
  \ I knew about crossing a road. \u201CHold your camera tightly, or it may be snatched\u201D\
  \ Thian added as Hanoi\u2019s Ho\xE0n Ki\u1EBFm Lake shimmered like a mirage across\
  \ from us. He had introduced himself earlier that day, welcoming me into the shade\
  \ of his fruit stand and granting my lungs temporary relief from the humidity. My\
  \ sweat mingled with thousands of others in the narrow alleys of a city holding\
  \ its head far too close to the sun. \n\nHe had started his business two years earlier,\
  \ at the age of fourteen. Every day he worked selling fruit, occasionally acting\
  \ as a guard across Hanoi\u2019s incessant stream of traffic. His parents would\
  \ have preferred for him to be in school. He respected their beliefs but found it\
  \ hard to listen, attributing his exceptional English not to years of schooling\
  \ but conversations with travelers on the street. \n\nHe worked to make money but\
  \ also to watch the bikes. They had a particular beauty, displaying the products\
  \ of the land and professions and daily patterns of its people. They were an emblem\
  \ of the Vietnamese hustle, a communication of culture. Despite skipping school\
  \ Thian did not believe he was missing out on education. As we watched a motorcycle\
  \ packed with dozens of live, quacking ducks fly by I could not disagree. There\
  \ were entire families on these tiny vehicles, boys in suits and girls dolled up.\
  \ We stood there transfixed, intoxicated by this all-permeating scent of petrol\
  \ mixed with perfume, blurred colours, sound, and motion. There was an incredible\
  \ vibrancy to it all that seemed to soften the frenetic edge of the city. \n\nThian\
  \ acted as a human shield when we stepped off the sidewalk, my breath beastly. He\
  \ laughed at my attempt to part the sea of blaring horns by carefully mimicking\
  \ his highway shuffle. His confidence masked my fear. Upon reaching the opposite\
  \ kerbside he prompted me to take pictures of the astonishing motorcycle cargo,\
  \ pointing out the ones he liked best. Unknowingly, allowing space for me to appreciate\
  \ what I had just achieved. \n\nIt may be foolish to attribute the growth in my\
  \ ability to manage disorder to a sixteen-year-old boy who could create calm amid\
  \ chaos, but recalling that first day on the cracked pavement in Hanoi is a very\
  \ reassuring thing indeed."
