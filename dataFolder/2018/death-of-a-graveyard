Text: "I could feel my toes curling, heart pounding, blood rushing. It was one of\
  \ the top 3 times I had felt the most anxious; after my dad first caught me smoking\u2014\
  a near sacrilege for a middle-class Indian girl. And when a stalker followed me\
  \ home and stole our porch lights as proof \u2018He Was There\u2019.\nIn the end\
  \ though, wanderlust triumphed over fear. And I began my 200-mtr-long walk from\
  \ my hotel at Clark Quay to Fort Canning station on the downtown line. That day,\
  \ I was headed to the 20th century Bukit Brown cemetery that is home to about 1\
  \ lakh graves.\nIt was my 5th day in Singapore. After several museums, cafes, antic\
  \ stores, gardens and then some more gardens, I had exhausted my 15-items long list\
  \ of places-to-visit, including Gardens by the Bay, Marina Bay Sand, Art Science\
  \ Museum, Botanic Garden, Chinese Garden, Singapore Zoo, Sentosa, Orchard Road and\
  \ Universal Studios.\nSo on my second last day there, out of options, I decided\
  \ to visit my first cemetery. Something, I had always seen as a rather morbid passion\
  \ of tomb tourists. Moreover, having always feared the paranormal, I could never\
  \ quite walk into an obvious \u2018ghostville\u2019.\nTwelve stations later, when\
  \ I reached Caldecott station, the cemetery was still 5 km away. So I hailed a cab,\
  \ despite being low on cash.\nThe driver was an elderly man, around 60, I reckoned.\
  \ At the mention of the destination, he first sized me up, then with a bemused look\
  \ asked, \u201Cbut why there?\u201DAs I tried to explain to him about the history\
  \ buried in the hills of Bukit Brown, my tryst to get over my fears, and the wanderlust\
  \ that makes you do things, he cut me short and gestured me to hop in. After that\
  \ he didn\u2019t talk much, except telling me that I might not see what I expected.\n\
  I didn\u2019t know what he meant. But asked no questions. My mind was filled with\
  \ fear and anxiety, and my eyes preoccupied with the galloping meter.\nIn fact,\
  \ I looked up only when he announced, \u201Cwe\u2019re here\u201D.\nWhat I saw,\
  \ scared me more than any ghostly apparition could. The deads were gone and so was\
  \ the graveyard. There were no gothic archways, no willowy trees, no elaborate tombs;\
  \ only hectares of land dotted with yellow boards erected by road authorities.\n\
  The Singaporean government was digging up graves to make way for roads, houses and\
  \ shopping centres. It was displacing the departed to accommodate the luxuries of\
  \ the living; and taking away the one thing that death promises, peace.\nI saw no\
  \ ghosts that day. Only a reminder, this life is all we got.\nCarpe Diem."
