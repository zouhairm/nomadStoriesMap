Text: "I worked in a bank for four years. At the beginning it was fun.\n\nBut in the\
  \ last two years, I started feeling like I had enough.\n\nFor various reasons. Lack\
  \ of morals, unfair rules, firing pregnant women. I am sure you know what I am talking\
  \ about, banks.\n\nThanks to their immorality I was able to sue them. It was a battle\
  \ that lasted six months.sue\_them. It was a battle which lasted six months.\n\n\
  At one point I had to decide between bringing them to justice or take the money\
  \ and run. My first idea was to go for justice.\n\nThat meant to keep working in\
  \ the bank. And unfortunately to be unhappy. So finally I chose to take the money\
  \ and be free.\n\nThen, I found myself with money in my account, for the first time\
  \ in my life. I did not have a mortgage, wife, cat or dog. And I thought:\_\n\n\xAB\
  I am totally free, now what?\xBB\nI spent weeks thinking about what to do. I had\
  \ a lot of headaches and I could not sleep well before I made the decision.\n\n\
  In that period of time, I felt exhausted. It is amazing how your mind can be your\
  \ worst enemy. I changed my plans a million times.\n\nSome friends suggested me\
  \ to visit Australia. They had been there and told me that it was an amazing place\
  \ to travel.\n\nI bought the travel guidebook and everything looked great. However,\
  \ I kept thinking about it for a while.\_\n\nFinally, I realized it was the perfect\
  \ time for me to travel and see the world. I had never thought of that. I thought\
  \ I was going to work in the bank until my final days.\n\nI did not know it at that\
  \ time. Life can become an amazing adventure."
