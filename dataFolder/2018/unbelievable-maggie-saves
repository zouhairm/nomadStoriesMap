Text: "Some choices lead to the border of life and death.  Taking a caravan of aid\
  \ to Bulgaria, we decided to avoid the toll and take the road from Osijek to Vukovar.\
  \ Suddenly there were burnt out vehicles in the ditches and a tree across the road.\
  \ Unaware that a conflict had erupted between Serbia and Croatia, we were heading\
  \ towards the border of two countries at war. Ten stubbly militia emerged from the\
  \ barricades and ten rifles pointed aggressively at four innocent travellers.  Doors\
  \ were flung open.  I knew the instant fear of having a gun slammed into my temple.\n\
  \u201CPistole,\u201D said one, pointing at the glove compartment. I was meant to\
  \ hand over my pistol. Amidst the CD\u2019s I failed to find a pistol. Brits do\
  \ not, as a rule, carry a pistol in their glove compartment- or gloves for that\
  \ matter.  By this time the driver, Alan, had been man-handled for reluctance to\
  \ hand over his camera, and taken round to the caravan door. There would obviously\
  \ be a gun fight as hoardes of fighters swarmed out, flinging grenades at them.\
  \ The door opened slowly and there they were\u2026boxes and boxes of tampons that\
  \ the Bulgarians had asked for. The military looked puzzled. They were expecting\
  \ something with balls to confront them, but these\u2026 these\u2026 lady things.\
  \ It fell to me to converse with our assailants.  My knowledge of Serbo-Croat was\
  \ non-existent, as were the English skills of the leader. I tried German: wir sind\
  \ englische Touristen und wir sind verloren.\nA light came on in the commander\u2019\
  s brain.\n\u201CMarrrgaret Thatcher!\u201D\nRunning on expectation-of-death adrenalin,\
  \ you can be sure that any word might come tumbling out.\n\u201CScheisse!\u201D\
  \ \nI know many would have chosen that exact word to describe our revered former\
  \ leader but in this case it did slip out. It had the desired effect. The guns were\
  \ lowered and there were guffaws of laughter. A joke about a world leader transcends\
  \ barriers. Maggie had saved our lives. In minutes the tree was moved and the caravan\
  \ sent packing, with instructions on how to avoid death. Heading into the early\
  \ evening sun for the toll road they should have taken earlier, the four occupants\
  \ decided there was only one thing to do: travel ten minutes from danger, lower\
  \ the caravan legs and put the kettle on. A stiff British lip and a nice cup of\
  \ tea were the perfect antidote to a near death adventure.  As an eerie footnote,\
  \ I still have a press cutting from a few days later: some foreigners were shot\
  \ dead \u201Cjust past the village of Bobota, on the road to Vukovar.\u201D"
