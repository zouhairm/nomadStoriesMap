Text: "July. Noon. I was standing on the forecastle of \u201CProfessor Molchanov\u201D\
  \ research vessel, breathing in Arctic fresh air, when I heard the announcement\
  \ from our captain: \u201CLanding in 30 minutes!\u201D Heart was pounding like a\
  \ beast, as we were approaching Bukhta Tikhaya, which translates as \u201CQuiet\
  \ Bay. \nI remember myself being completely overwhelmed after just one first step\u2026\
  \ My mind was torn between 2 options \u2013 to run around and touch everything,\
  \ be a discoverer, be this irresistibly curious kid, or to spend the rest of our\
  \ landing time there, standing and simply gazing around, stunned. The local color\
  \ palette included all shades of blue, grey and brown, with sudden pops of color,\
  \ provided by rare polar poppies and saxifrages, and the local \u201Csoundtrack\u201D\
  \ was restrained to 3 main ambients \u2013 wind, waves and bird screech from the\
  \ Rubini Rock(beloved nesting place, aka \u201Cbird market\u201D). \nAnyway, it\
  \ was pure joy, not only mentally, but physically as well, since we could finally\
  \ put our feet on something solid and stable, after being sort of trapped on the\
  \ ship for 11 days\u2026\nWe had only 2 hours to explore the island, so no lingering!\
  \ \nThe expedition crew fell apart \u2013 some were chilling on the shore, some\
  \ were strolling uphill-downhill, seeking for a polar fox, some were taking measurements\
  \ and collecting soil samples. \nAfter catching Zen moments and silently wowing\
  \ at solemn calmness of gorgeous surrounding, I went for a prominent checkpoint\
  \ - the Northernmost Russian post office, located at 80\xB0 N. Basically, it\u2019\
  s a cozy tiny 1-storey building, with gift shop and post office under one roof.\
  \ Inside, we were saluted by 2 young people, Nikita and Anya, who, as it turned\
  \ out to be, voluntarily worked there from May to August. They were delighted to\
  \ see new faces and share some stories about their life in the Far North. \u201C\
  We live just next door with the lady that cooks everything for us\u201D, said Nikita,\
  \ smiling. \u201CIt may be hard to imagine, but all our food is delivered here by\
  \ icebreaker, way in advance, all in one portion, which is 1,5 tons. We have to\
  \ download all music and movies in advance, and turn the lights on only when tourists\
  \ come. Also I don\u2019t freak out when I look out the window and see polar bears\
  \ walking by, it\u2019s all natural!\u201D\nThis day made me think about people\
  \ not appreciating the commodities they have, constantly nagging about minor issues,\
  \ sinking into comfort. Our unity with nature is being wiped out, but is this the\
  \ right thing we\u2019re heading to?"
