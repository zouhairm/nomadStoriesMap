Text: "As far as formalities are concerned, a first name is all you need when you\
  \ meet a stranger. He gave his as John. Mine was simply David. Two simple old school\
  \ names reflecting nothing of the unbearable melancholy of the self.\nHe had a six-speed\
  \ bike, minimalistically austere, with worn out pedals. Mine was three-speed rental\
  \ with some added razzmatazz and a light to go with. I am sure my bike had seen\
  \ all the streets of Berlin and its fair share of tourist hands. His squealed of\
  \ small cities, back roads and lonesome highways.\nWe shared a room at the youth\
  \ hostels that night, two strangers in a room meant for eight. He held a picture,\
  \ a wistful smile tagging on his dry lips. His wife and daughter, and he hadn\u2019\
  t seen them in 6 months. Once those words were out, the story just flowed through\
  \ the wounds he carried. A story I bet he did not want to tell but had to, to avoid\
  \ holding it all in.\nHe was from Moldova, lured to Germany by a company that promised\
  \ more than what it was willing to deliver. Two months of hard work and he walked\
  \ out without pay. They found a loophole to exploit on the contract, harvested his\
  \ labor and left him poorer. He had been cycling since, one odd job at a time, one\
  \ indifferent town to another. Along the way, his passport got lost and so was waiting\
  \ on his embassy to get him a new one. More money needed, more strange towns to\
  \ see. He said the names of some of these towns with some bitterness, each word\
  \ a stinging reminder of his unpleasant ordeals there. These ones he kept to himself:\
  \ there are things a man just has to keep to his heart, though the risk is that\
  \ these bitter moments act as a tannery, hardening a man\u2019s heart into bitter\
  \ leather. That\u2019s the world we live in, a tannery for good hearts.\nIt\u2019\
  s sad how the world breaks dreamers, when the idealistic spark of optimism is crushed\
  \ by human greed and manipulation, turning the wide-eyed wanderer into a cynically\
  \ bitter pessimist. The heavy machinery groans on and empathy is exploited as a\
  \ weakness. While on the ground, they spit heartless words like \u201Cgrow up\u201D\
  \ or \u201Cbe realistic\u201D where being realistic is a euphemism for losing one\u2019\
  s humanity for personal selfish reasons.\nOut there, there are still some dreamers\
  \ who cycle on, a mile at a time. There ought to be a place for dreamers. My spirit\
  \ cycles with the Johns of this world. There is a smiling wife and teary daughter\
  \ at the end of that lonesome cycle track. I live for that teary hug beyond the\
  \ grips of human greed and \u201Creality.\u201D"
