Text: "There is a woman standing in front of me. \n\nShe is a local woman with the\
  \ face of a grandmother. Her skin and eyes proudly reflect the years of her life\
  \ and the hours in the sun spent gathering food from her garden. She is petite,\
  \ yet the way she stands reflects the strength developed from maintaining her home\
  \ and land over the years. She lives alone. She is a stranger. She is lovely. \n\
  \nAfter I settle into her casita, she invites me into the kitchen: a separate one\
  \ room stone building. When we step inside we leave the desert heat of May outside\
  \ only to be greeted by the more humid heat of cooking. She does not seem to notice\
  \ nor mind the heat, but smiles warmly and gestures around the space. We don\u2019\
  t speak, but rather smile at one another and nod a lot. I am uncomfortable, but\
  \ as with the heat, she does not seem to notice, nor mind. \n\nAn hour or so later\
  \ the lovely woman sits across from me at the heavy wooden table inside the unassuming\
  \ casita, and while we have shared the intimacy of her kitchen, we still do not\
  \ share the same language. Awkwardness accompanies the platter of chicken in Adobo\
  \ that sits before us, and it does not seem gesturing will support us in the same\
  \ way it had previously done in the kitchen. What now? What do we say? How do we\
  \ say it? Moments pass, and eventually the only option is to try - to begin. \n\n\
  Guided by a pocket English-Spanish dictionary, and the remnants of junior high Spanish\
  \ tucked somewhere deep in my mind, we speak. She tells me of her children & grandchildren\
  \ in The United States, and I tell her of my parents and brothers in Utah. Her English\
  \ is more limited than my Spanish, but somehow the awkwardness subsides & the conversation\
  \ begins. Somehow we enter into a conversation that moves beyond words - beyond\
  \ the vast contrast of two foreign languages - and into meaning. We realize there\
  \ is more to connecting than words. We step over what appeared to be a barrier &\
  \ realize that beyond the differences of language, culture, and age - there is familiarity.\
  \ We are able to understand each other, & even though the words may not be perfect,\
  \ the conversation is.  \n\nIt\u2019s been nine years since I sat across from that\
  \ lovely woman in Cuer Navaca, Mexico. I do not remember her name, but I remember\
  \ her. I remember feeling welcome in her home. I remember how in each moment I spent\
  \ with her I found a new appreciation for her kindness. I remember the woman who\
  \ opened not only her home to a young American graduate student, but her life."
