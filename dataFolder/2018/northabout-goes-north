Text: "A bump in the night can be a scary thing. When you\u2019re asleep aboard a\
  \ 49ft aluminium yacht in an ice field 60 miles South of Greenland, it can be terrifying.\
  \ Awoken by a sudden sideways lurching and a screeching crash, my first thought\
  \ was - \u2018not good\u2019. \n \u201CIt sounds worse than it is\u201D reassured\
  \ our skipper. Mike is a seasoned ice navigator; having already negotiated Northabout\
  \ through plenty of ice on a leg of the Polar Ocean Challenge last year\u2026 \u201C\
  that one came out of nowhere!\u201D. \n  The bergs are unavoidable. What started\
  \ as a solitary lump of ice appearing on the horizon after seven days of open ocean\
  \ soon became a labyrinth of meter-thick ice floes stretching as far as the eye\
  \ could see. \u201CMight need you up the mast again mate\u201D. \n  We had been\
  \ trying to make land for two days, probing the ice field for weaknesses before\
  \ finally discovering a passage clear enough to reach the coast, all be it 100 nautical\
  \ miles west of our intended landing point. We\u2019d initially hoped to make Prins\
  \ Christian Sund on the South Eastern Coast, supposedly one of Greenlands more impressive\
  \ fjords, but the most recent ice chart from the Danish Meteorological Institute\
  \ suggested this was going to be impossible. We received these reports daily, giving\
  \ us some indication of the density of the ice pack surrounding Cape Farewell through\
  \ coloured blobs on a map of Greenland (green - low density, through to red - high\
  \ density), with corresponding \u2018eggs\u2019 indicating percentage of coverage.\
  \ When we left Iceland, our intended destination was green/yellow - do-able. By\
  \ the time we were within a few hundred miles of the coast six days later, it was\
  \ very red. The ice around the coast is extremely unpredictable, and had shifted\
  \ to block our path; our plan had to evolve. Plan B was to head 120 miles South\
  \ of Cape Farewell in order to avoid the notoriously strong winds and high seas\
  \ close to the coast, and approach using the much calmer West Greenland Current.\
  \ A solid plan, but even the daily satellite ice charts struggle to keep up with\
  \ the speed at which the floes move, and we soon found ourselves in a maze\u2026\
  \ \u201CMight need you up the mast again mate\u201D.\nWe had departed Portishead\
  \ in England almost three months prior, on a crisp morning in early April, led by\
  \ our skipper Mike - an ex SAS officer turned delivery yachtsman, and Dave - our\
  \ first mate and seasoned Yacht Master. We were delivering Northabout for her upcoming\
  \ role as support vessle for various Arctic expeditions... the best was yet to come!"
