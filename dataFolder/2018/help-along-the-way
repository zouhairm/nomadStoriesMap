Text: "My stomach flutters with excitement, my breath catching in my throat as the\
  \ plane descends through the clouds, the airstrip coming into view far below. My\
  \ breath fogs up the glass as I peer down, the city blow appearing almost like a\
  \ toy it's so small. The plane makes a smooth landing, and I disembark before grabbing\
  \ my luggage--a suitcase and small duffel--before walking down the ramp and into\
  \ the airport.\n\nI make it through quickly, and once I exit the security checkpoint,\
  \ I slow to a stop, shocked. There are hundreds of people, all dressed in rags,\
  \ their hair unkempt and their bodies stick thin with hunger that has gone unsatiated\
  \ far too long.\n\nI turn in a circle, my eyes wide as I take everything in, the\
  \ visions I'd had of how my trip would go evaporating in my mind. This isn't anything\
  \ like the pictures I'd seen in the brochure. I walk through the crowd, my heart\
  \ pounding in my chest as the people here part before me, their eyes following me\
  \ warily as though expecting me to either yell at them, or something far worse.\n\
  \nThere's fear in their eyes, and I can't fathom what may have put it there. I approach\
  \ the doors slowly, a woman in a pantsuit with an armed guard at her side waiting\
  \ for me, a sign with my name on it in her hands.\n\nI wrestle with myself for a\
  \ moment before turning back and seeking out the family who looks as though they\
  \ need the most help. My eyes are immediately drawn to a small family, with a man,\
  \ woman and child. I approach them and pull several granola bars from my bag, offering\
  \ them to the family hesitantly.\n\nThe woman takes them slowly, looking from me\
  \ to the bars as if unable to believe I've offered them to her. The man keeps a\
  \ mistrustful eye on me as he scoops the little girl into his arms and rests a hand\
  \ on the woman's back protectively. The woman hands the bars to her husband, I note,\
  \ taking in the small bands on their ring fingers. \n\n\"Thank you so much!\", tears\
  \ welling up in her eyes. \"You have no idea how much this means to me\", she murmurs\
  \ as she wraps me in a warm hug. When she pulls away, she holds a hand out to me,\
  \ \"My name is Vera Leyanna\", She says, introducing herself. \"I am Lucy Naveer\"\
  \  I say as I reach out, shaking her hand with a smile.\n\nI smile at the family\
  \ before turning back to the woman with the sign. \"Maybe we'll meet again someday\"\
  , I say to Vera before walking out of the airport with the representative that is\
  \ here to pick me up with the hotel I reserved for my stay."
