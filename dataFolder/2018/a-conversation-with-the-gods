Text: "Ten hours, two boats, one coach and a motorcycle ride later, I had finally\
  \ arrived on the small island of Flores in northern Guatemala. After a long day\
  \ of travel, there is nothing more satisfying than a brilliant sunset, an ice cold\
  \ beer, and the feeling of being settled- if only for a few days. \nAfter 3 days\
  \ spent on a beautiful yet, isolate beach in Livingston I was pining for good conversation.\
  \ I sat next to T\xE9o by chance on the crowded, dusty coach that passed its prime\
  \ years ago. He was a young man with big brown eyes lined with thin glasses and\
  \ a wide, albeit infrequent, smile. The ride was chaotic as music played while passengers\
  \ hollered and laughed each time we jumped due to the uneven road. At first T\xE9\
  o was reluctant to chat, but softened as the conversation progressed. He complimented\
  \ my less than perfect Spanish and I learned he worked as a tour guide while studying\
  \ archaeology. We bonded over our mutual passion for learning about indigenous cultures\
  \ of Latin America. \nSo there I was, beer in hand, looking over Lago Pet\xE9n Itza\
  \ and before I knew it, I had plans for the next day. The purpose of my visiting\
  \ Flores was to experience the iconic Tikal national park and T\xE9o offered to\
  \ take me on a private tour. I accepted this once in a lifetime opportunity and\
  \ was greeted by my new friend at 4pm the following day, with his motorcycle in\
  \ tow.\n\nAfter an hour of marveling at the countryside as the sun descended over\
  \ platano fields, we arrived at the gates of Tikal. Upon entry I could feel the\
  \ park\u2019s vivacious spirit. The jungle could swallow the former Maya city whole\
  \ if left alone for a few weeks. Every tree had a story and each animal a role in\
  \ this ancient, yet thriving ecosystem. \n\nAs we made our way to the temples, I\
  \ was overcome with emotion. It was as if my history books had materialized before\
  \ my eyes and I was written in to the story. We neared the plaza and the apices\
  \ of the twin pyramids were just visible over the canopy of the forest. The sheer\
  \ scale of the shrines was overwhelming. The site\u2019s energy was electric and\
  \ in that moment I wondered if the spirits had anything to say. Suddenly there was\
  \ a roar of thunder. A lightning storm erupted and the pyramids were illuminated\
  \ by the dancing lights in the sky. From below you could make out their silhouette\
  \ against the natural light show. The beauty of it was powerful. I knew that the\
  \ gods were putting on a show to welcome me to their former home, and that makes\
  \ me smile to this day."
