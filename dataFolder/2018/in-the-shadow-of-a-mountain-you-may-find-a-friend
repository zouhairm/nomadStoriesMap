Text: "Sun-filled beaches, humming waterfalls, street markets and glorious architecture.\
  \ That is not where the night took me then. It shouldn\u2019t have taken me anywhere,\
  \ for I was finding myself in San Cassiano; a charming village hiding below where\
  \ the Italian Alps peak. There, the ski lifts finish before the sun sets, the snowcats\
  \ shut their engines about when you\u2019d spot the first marten sneaking behind\
  \ the trees, and the local \u201CApreski\u201D bars go dark with enough time spare\
  \ to hop on the passing snowmobile, getting a lift down, to feast on \u201CTiroler\
  \ Speckknodel\u201D accompanied by wine.\n\nI was meant to follow the pattern, run\
  \ the last slope while admiring the sparks, once brightly reflecting in the snow,\
  \ going dull in the rhythm of my turns, as the sun slowly set behind the mountain.\
  \ Instead, I took a little too long to capture the perfect Instagram from top of\
  \ the ski resort, or perhaps I\u2019d spent more time polishing off the glorious\
  \ Kaiserschmarren, fully embracing a place that takes combining Austrian and Italian\
  \ cultures to such degree, where even the star-receiving dish is multinational.\n\
  \nBefore long, I was stuttering a timid \u201Cgrazie\u201D for a torch the cabin\
  \ owner was offering, and I prayed my skis were under enough control to take me\
  \ all the way to my hotel. I would be lying, however, if I said the darkness wasn\u2019\
  t somewhat multiplied when every direction I turned my head to, there were foothills\
  \ and mountain peaks, and the moon was just a bit too gloomy to rely on for light.\n\
  \nLittle did I know, as I was ploughing my way through where I hoped the slope was,\
  \ silhouettes of conifers passing by, the occasional snowflake landing on my cheeks,\
  \ I would make a friend that night. A whole clique, to be precise. I was an outsider\
  \ to the group when I first spotted the tiny footsteps, making me stop to gaze towards\
  \ where they disappeared. This is not a fairy-tale, and I did not take off my equipment\
  \ to shake hands with a bunch of marmots. But as I stood there, watching their shadows\
  \ jump around, playing in the trees, bitter snow cracking underneath their paws,\
  \ I was left in a complete awe.\n\nI couldn\u2019t tell you if the shivers down\
  \ my spine were caused by the breath-takingly peaceful experience, entirely in the\
  \ hands of nature, or if it was the breeze of the 10pm-time nearly 2000m above sea.\
  \ What I am sure of, though, is that the image of that moment, which Instagram shall\
  \ never see, will forever remain at the back of my mind, evoking feelings of calm\
  \ that I\u2019ll keep failing to put into words."
