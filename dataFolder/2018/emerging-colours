Text: "From the window in front of me, I could see the white sky behind the trees,\
  \ naked because of wintertime. The smoke of the chimney was white too, and it went\
  \ from side to side, falling in love with the wind.\nThat was my new, unexpected,\
  \ observation point; my new house in Brussels.\nFor how long? I didn\u2019t know\
  \ yet.\nIn some moments, my old life in the South of Italy seemed so far that I\
  \ could not even imagine it was mine. It appeared as a ghost only when the shine\
  \ of my new adventure was covered by the normal life\u2019s habits. In a supermarket,\
  \ for example, looking for something to eat I wouldn\u2019t have found. In those\
  \ moments I had some kind of melancholy, just few seconds of dejavu. \nFortunately\
  \ they disappeared in the space of a moment, when the efforts to speak in an understandable\
  \ French recalled all my attention to the present moment.\nI had never imagined\
  \ that destination for my thirties, but life can be so surprising!\nI was determined\
  \ to overcome my prejudices about the weather and the North, so I went out for a\
  \ walk bringing my camera with me. I always feel I can see better the world through\
  \ the lens of my reflex. \nI started my exploration without any map, to open all\
  \ my senses to the street. The smell of a Turkish Pide, a particular colour of the\
  \ roofs, a little park just around the corner. My signposting was all about details.\n\
  The wind of January was blowing, strong and cold, bringing a thin rain on my face\
  \ and I was freezing, but not enough to stop my exploration.\nI felt alone, and\
  \ a little lost, so I started to watch the people I met directly in the eyes, no\
  \ matter what they could have thought. I desired a contact, in someway.\nSometimes,\
  \ the cold or warmth are inside us, and from there they can spread over the entire\
  \ body and even more, outside, to reach the others.\nI remember precisely the sensation\
  \ of being hugged with no arms nor chest; just a clear look with a smile. A girl\
  \ on her bike gave me that sense of humanity I strongly needed in those first days\
  \ of my new life, and suddenly my blood began to circulate warmer and warmer, my\
  \ fears started to be rarefied as the clouds in the sky over me.\nAll of a sudden,\
  \ something amazing happened.\nA shy sunlight brightened the leaves in the park.\
  \ All the buildings, and streets, and people were emerging from the grey, with their\
  \ own colours.\nAnd so did my heart, full of hope."
