Text: "After a summer of interning in Scotland and travelling around this country\
  \ I now called home, I knew I needed to pursue areas outside of my newly formed\
  \ comfort zone. With my internship approaching its end, I seized an opportunity\
  \ to tour a country I had so long dreamt of. On a dismal, damp night in September\
  \ I flew over to Dublin, Ireland. After a long bus ride from the airport, I arrived\
  \ at the outskirts of the city feeling as though I had stepped into a sort of twilight\
  \ zone. My eyes glanced nervously from my map to the surrounding streets spotting\
  \ finally the hostel I had booked. After a weary night\u2019s sleep, I awoke with\
  \ a renewed sense of adventure. Finding my travel group in the cramped lobby, I\
  \ filed onto the tour bus shortly after sunrise. We began journeying along the crag-ridden\
  \ coast with views more spectacular than any postcard could hope to convey. We waded\
  \ through hordes of tourists in Galway, admiring eccentric street performers and\
  \ various shops advertising the most authentic Claddagh rings money could buy. We\
  \ journeyed on to the Cliffs of Moher on a frightfully stormy day, looking out at\
  \ the dizzying heights with fearful courage. Nights spent in towns between destinations\
  \ allowed a glimpse of true Irish culture as I sat in on \u201Ctrad\u201D sessions\
  \ of local musicians and danced with stout old Irishmen. On our last tour stop,\
  \ we ventured to an area in central southern Ireland. Killarney struck me as a quiet\
  \ church town free of the usual tourist traps and clamor of the bigger cities. Cottage-style\
  \ houses and brightly colored shops lined the streets. The sun, still prominent\
  \ in the sky, illuminated my path as I wandered alone aimlessly for hours. I found\
  \ myself drifting farther away from town and closer to a more rural landscape offset\
  \ by the grand outline of St. Mary\u2019s Cathedral. Soon I stumbled upon the quaint\
  \ 19th century Thatched Cottage marking the entrance to Killarney National Park.\
  \ I realized quickly the sort of Eden I had entered into. The sun glinted behind\
  \ age-old oak and yew trees as my mind fell into a dreamlike state accompanied by\
  \ the occasional hiker stopping to say hello. A ragged wooden fence lined the heavily\
  \ trodden trail adding to the wonder of such an arbitrarily discovered countryside.\
  \ As the sun steadily set, I moseyed back to town with a sense of serenity I had\
  \ never before felt. A piece of me remains in those hills. It has beckoned to me\
  \ every day since to uncover more fully the beauty that lies within."
