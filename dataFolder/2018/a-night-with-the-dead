Text: "I put my camera away. I didn\u2019t want to take any more pictures. In fact,\
  \ I regretted the ones I already took. It just didn\u2019t seem right anymore, like\
  \ I was trespassing on their special moment. \u201CDon\u2019t worry. You can take\
  \ a picture,\u201D Miguel assured me with a smile. \u201CMy whole family is here.\u201D\
  \ He pointed to the graves around us and then to his two young children playing\
  \ games and eating candy. HIs wife, Marcela was starting a fire under a small grill\
  \ a short distance away.\n\nI had come to Mexico to experience Day of the Dead.\
  \ Walking through the candlelit cemetery among families preparing to spend the long\
  \ night graveside, I felt very removed from my surroundings and the people around\
  \ me. I was witnessing this fervent celebration of life and death, but I wasn\u2019\
  t experiencing it. It was during this moment of dejection that Miguel waved me over\
  \ and introduced himself.\n\nMiguel explained that we were at the grave of his father.\
  \ His grandmother was buried just over there, behind the tall candles that illuminated\
  \ the orange marigolds strewn about the tombs. His aunts, uncles, and others were\
  \ about us as well. \u201CTonight we celebrate a family reunion. My father always\
  \ enjoyed having guests. Tonight you can be our guest.\u201D An ancient man, perhaps\
  \ his grandfather, looked up from under a straw hat and nodded approvingly.\n\n\
  As the piney smell of copal incense filled the cool night air Miguel explained that\
  \ his family comes to this cemetery every October 31 to celebrate the lives of their\
  \ ancestors. This felt completely foreign to me. We seldom talk about death like\
  \ this in my family. We never visit the cemetery. Yet here I was with someone I\
  \ had just met sharing an intimate moment with three generations of his family among\
  \ the graves of his ancestors.\n\nAs Miguel described his father I could almost\
  \ feel as though he were sitting there with us. I was starting to understand the\
  \ true importance of Dia de Muertos as a day of celebration and reunion. We shared\
  \ stories and jokes. I practiced my broken Spanish with the children and passed\
  \ around a bottle of fiery mezcal liquor with the adults. The night lingered on,\
  \ lit by candles, laughter, and memories."
