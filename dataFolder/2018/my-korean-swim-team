  \ for me. \n\nAfter a five-minute skype interview I had found myself living in Daegu,\
  \ South Korea teaching English for a year. Looking for a way to bring my routine\
  \ at home to the land of kimchi, I had asked my boss about swimming pools in the\
  \ area. Saturday morning at 8 am, he picked me up.\n\n\u201CThey have actually never\
  \ had a foreigner in the building\u201D He corrected.\n\nThe Korean was exchanged\
  \ at a high velocity.  My head swung just as fast. Chan took out his credit card,\
  \ signed a piece of paper and triumphantly announced, \u201CYou are on the team!\
  \ You start tomorrow!\u201D\n\nMy fears of being the slowest swimmer were replaced\
  \ with the reality of being the fastest. Even more, attention was drawn to the tall\
  \ girl with light hair as I was tasked with leading the lane. The only small obstacle\
  \ was that I couldn\u2019t understand the coach. \n\nI stumbled through the practice\
  \ and my teammates grew curious about me. They approached me in the shower and poked\
  \ at my tattoos, offered me yogurt and asked where I was from. The drills and sets\
  \ were different but the strokes were the same. At the conclusion of each workout,\
  \ we held hands and cheered \u201Cfight-ting!\u201D the Korean version of good luck,\
  \ go fast and great job all in one.\n\nMy teammates\u2019 curiosity grew into acceptance\
  \ and then bloomed into full-blown friendship. Even though I knew nothing about\
  \ my friends, not even their names, they all became so special to me. Three days\
  \ a week for 9 months, we shared a lane; a little sliver of the world where a girl\
  \ from Alaska and a group of Korean swimmers shared their love water and swam. \n\
  \nI grew accustomed to taking off my shoes and placing them in a special locker.\
  \ I even adjusted to eating eggs in the shower. I had conversations based entirely\
  \ on body language and google translate. I was gifted tea when I was sick and boxes\
  \ of permission on Korean Thanksgiving. \n\nOn my last practice, I tried to say\
  \ thank you. I tried to say that this group of people would be one of my most cherished\
  \ memories from Korea. That swimming had always been what was familiar to me, and\
  \ in a land where the food, language, rituals, and traditions where different I\
  \ still had a home in the pool. Thanks to them. \n\n I didn\u2019t know how to say\
  \ any of this. I had barely learned the names of the four strokes. So I held hands\
  \ with my teammates as we stood in a circle one last time and took part in a tradition\
  \ I had learned to love as we cheered \u201CFight-ting!\u201D"
