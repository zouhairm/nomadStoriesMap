Text: "I would like to start telling my  worst Stories  in 2017. It was interesting\
  \ to say the least. Honestly, it was one of my down years. It wasn\u2019t awful,\
  \ but if I were to rate from a 1-10 scale, it would be receiving a solid 5. While\
  \ 2017 met me with multiple struggles and issues that were many times out of my\
  \ control and unbeatable, it was not the worst I have ever had. But it was some\
  \ kinda tedious year cos this year I had to enroll in residency degree  it\u2019\
  s sort of medical degree so from this started my all problems . \n\nThe first half\
  \ of 2017 got off to a decent start. I came into the year very motivated to make\
  \ it better than the last. My 2016 kind of fell apart during the last month, but\
  \ I survived and claimed that 2017 would be my year. I was wrong. While the year\
  \ seemed to be going okay for a couple of weeks, many of the problems that plagued\
  \ the end of the previous year came rushing back. The problem was, I pushed a lot\
  \ of those issues under the rug and acted like they would solve themselves, and\
  \ obviously they didn\u2019t. I had to solve those problems myself and figure out\
  \ what was best for me.\n\nI did figure out what was best for me. I acted on it\
  \ and did what I needed to do. Through that I discovered who my actual friends were\
  \ and was able to get rid of the snakes and toxic people in my life. While that\
  \ decision would ultimately make me happier in the long run, the short run was hard\
  \ to deal with. Here\u2019s an example of how I felt. There is a scene in an older\
  \ Disney movie called Treasure Planet. It\u2019s a flashback where the main character\
  \ is only a kid and he wakes up one morning to see his dad walking away from their\
  \ house and onto a ship with all his belongings. He runs down the stairs to find\
  \ his mother crying with her head down. He runs desperately to catch up to his dad,\
  \ but his dad reaches the ship and it takes off, leaving him reaching out towards\
  \ the ship as it pulls away. He would never see his dad again. Well in my situation,\
  \ I was the main character, the mom weeping was my heart, and the dad was my life\
  \ slipping past me faster than I could catch up. I truly felt like I was losing\
  \ control of everything I had. My life at the time felt like it wasn\u2019t mine\
  \ anymore, and if I didn\u2019t do my absolute best to get it back, it would ruin\
  \ me forever. In spite of this I have been surviving since I had come cross with\
  \ some difficulties. And currently whatever happens I try to lift my mood up!"
