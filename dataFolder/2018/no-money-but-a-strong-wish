Text: "It's been 2 months since I had arrived from the city of thousand lights, Seoul.\
  \ When I stepped for the first time in Astana airport I felt that something really\
  \ important to me was left there behind. All my international connections: lovely\
  \ faces, different languages, cultures. And now I'm back home and sitting on my\
  \ couch and know that routine is going to void me soon. \nTwo months I was checking\
  \ flights from Astana to somewhere where my friends are: Seoul, Jakarta, Sao Paolo,\
  \ Mexico, Bogota. My budget was about 500$ and it was not enough. No money but a\
  \ strong wish. One singer said in his song: \"Where can I get money? -Better ask\
  \ why you do have legs\" This expression gave me an answer: hitchhike than. So I\
  \ opened google map and was thinking where can I go. The Internet is a great power.\
  \ I found a lot of information about everything I could confront in my journey.\
  \ So it gave me good option is going to Mongolia and get the Chinese visa there.\
  \ From Astana to Ulan-Bataar is 4177 km. \nWhen I told my family about a thing I\
  \ want to do everyone started to dissuade me. Just imagine that your 20 years old\
  \ child is going to hitchhike through Siberia. Though is not winter, this is still\
  \ dangerous. This decision that pushed me to the edge. \n500 $ on my balance and\
  \ wish travel around the world. So that's how everything started.  I have prepared\
  \ everything in couple weeks and started my journey at 18 of May 2016. 700 km in\
  \ one day was pretty good for the first time. I was encouraged about this. But nothing\
  \ lasts forever. While I've been sleeping in a tent first night, I was frozen that\
  \ I felt my heart was pricked by coldness. That day I start hating cold. I could\
  \ come back home that day, but I decided to do finish what I started. With a smile\
  \ on my face journey was saved. \nDay by day I was passing through Russia. 4177\
  \ km for couple weeks. When I arrived in Ulan-Bator I've found that only Russian\
  \ citizens can get the visa there and whole my plan was cancelled. So started my\
  \ journey back to Kazakhstan. More than 8000 km I've passed and didn't gain anything\
  \ as I thought. But when I fell asleep on my bed I understand that I've done a really\
  \ incredible thing that most people would never do in their life. For 30 days I've\
  \ just spent 80$ and got a lot of stories to tell and share with the world. That\
  \ summer I discovered my traveller nature and couldn't resist anymore. \nA few weeks\
  \ later I made another trip to Georgia, Turkey, South Russia. But it's another story\
  \ for next time."
