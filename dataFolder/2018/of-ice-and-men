Text: "Tiny spikes under my barely-worn purple hiking boots gripped the ice beneath\
  \ me. These precious pieces of metal were all that stood between me and sudden death.\
  \ \n\nI froze. As still as the ice on this Icelandic glacier and half-way up a jagged\
  \ frozen hill, my entire body seized. \n\n\"I can't do it,\" I said nervously to\
  \ our guide, Thor, as the group continued onward. He smiled, trying not to roll\
  \ his eyes. \"Yes, you can. Just lift your foot.\" I tried. It wouldn't budge. \"\
  I think I'm just going to go back to the bus.\" \n\nThor chuckled, as if he's heard\
  \ this one before, and pointed to the vast landscape behind us. \"You remember where\
  \ it is?\" I glanced back at the rocky terrain of marbled ice and volcanic ash.\
  \ Our bus just a memory now, parked safely somewhere on the other side of this frozen\
  \ obstacle course. \n\nWe were already an hour into our hike. Thor was right. Somehow,\
  \ I had to do this. \"I'm scared,\" I confessed with tears in my eyes. \"It's going\
  \ to be fine. You can do it.\" His words sounded valid. He seemed sincere. I gazed\
  \ up the steep hill at the rest of my group. They were doing it! I can too. I must.\
  \ \n\nI didn't tell my family back home I was doing this today. It was out of character\
  \ for me to be this outdoorsy. I couldn\u2019t have Thor phone home and tell everyone\
  \ I just refused to get off a glacier. They'll say it couldn\u2019t possibly be\
  \ me and they\u2019ll hang up. I'll be stuck here forever. How did I get myself\
  \ into this? I could've just gone to a spa.\n\nI leaned forward. My heart thumped.\
  \ I quickly glimpsed down at the drop to my early grave. I was putting all my faith\
  \ now into these borrowed crampons and the words of an exasperated Icelandic tour\
  \ guide. \n\n\"Just tell me I'm not the first person who's freaked out up here,\"\
  \ I said, feeling completely defeated. \"You're not,\" Thor sighed. He held out\
  \ his hand. He could've been lying. I was cool with that. I needed to believe I\
  \ wasn't Iceland's wimpiest tourist ever.  \n\nI took Thor's hand and lifted my\
  \ foot from behind me. Cautiously, I carried it forward. It worked! I tried it again\
  \ with the other foot. And again. He let go. Those tiny little spikes crunched into\
  \ the ice and guided me up the hill. \n\nSuddenly, I was standing at the top. I\
  \ was shocked. I did it! It was one of the greatest moments of my life. I felt so\
  \ alive. I felt so free! I felt so-- \"You coming?\" I peered into the distance\
  \ at Thor waiting with my group at the foot of an even taller icy slope. \n\nIt\
  \ was going to be a long day."
