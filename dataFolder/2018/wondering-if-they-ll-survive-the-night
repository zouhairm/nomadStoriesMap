Text: "The last thing I expected was to travel five thousand miles away from home\
  \ and for wild dogs to be the thing that scared me most. Little did I know it wouldn\u2019\
  t be myself I would be scared for? Before embarking on my journey I ran through\
  \ some worst possible scenarios in my head: I would be terribly homesick or become\
  \ too ill to volunteer or my character wouldn\u2019t be strong enough. I was 17\
  \ when I decided to embark on a volunteering mission with 17 other students for\
  \ 17 days to Kolkata, India. \n\nOne of the things I struggled with since coming\
  \ home and following years is why me? Why do I get to eat everyday and have an education?\
  \ What makes me different? Nothing. It was pure luck that I wasn\u2019t born in\
  \ Kolkata. I met amazing children who would be so better than me in my position,\
  \ who are so bright and funny but trapped by their situation. It doesn\u2019t make\
  \ sense that some people can eat to excess every night while others struggle to\
  \ find food just to survive.\n\nOne night we were walking back from a cricket match\
  \ late at night. I was used to seeing the streets crowded with people, colours,\
  \ smells and noises. But the streets became more deserted until it was just us,\
  \ the wild dogs and people sleeping on the streets. Of all the things that shocked\
  \ me or made me nervous I never would have expected that seeing and hearing wild\
  \ dogs roam the streets would hit me so hard. \n\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\
  \uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\n\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFC\uFFFCMost people\
  \ slept on the ground over a thin sheet, with their few possessions scattered around\
  \ them. I saw a mother and a father sleeping side-by-side and in- between them their\
  \ perfect tiny baby. A baby who was not yet aware of the life she\u2019d been born\
  \ into. By now she\u2019ll see that as normal. She won\u2019t know any different.\
  \ A baby sleeping on the side of the street shouldn\u2019t be normal.\n\nOne man\
  \ I passed was curled up slightly, clutching his sheet, dreaming. He was like a\
  \ child. It hit me how completely and utterly vulnerable these people are. Anything\
  \ could happen to them at night. Someone could come up and steal the only belongings\
  \ they have in the world. The dogs could attack them. Someone could just snatch\
  \ that baby away from the little family. Anything.\n\nSleep is the most peaceful\
  \ part of my day. I let go of any stress or worry I\u2019ve been feeling and let\
  \ my mind and body rest. I know nothing bad will happen to me. I feel safe. These\
  \ people can never sleep easy.\n\nNobody should have to live like that. \n\nJust\
  \ managing to survive the day and wondering if they\u2019ll survive the night."
