Text: "Kaikoura, New Zealand. At 4am in the morning you can't expect much from someone\
  \ who needs two espresso shots to start functioning. Kaikoura is dark and quiet,\
  \ the exception being the 6 of us on this little bus. The prospect of swimming with\
  \ wild dolphins is more effective than any caffeine I've encountered so far. Whilst\
  \ the guides help us into our wet-suits and supply us with snorkels, they explain\
  \ how to interact with the rare dusky dolphins (high-pitched noises as they respond\
  \ to high level frequencies). I am still contemplating how to sing through a snorkel\
  \ and breathe at the same time when the guides get us onto a boat to start our search.\n\
  \nThese are proper wild dolphins; not kept in specific areas nor fed to lure them\
  \ towards tourists. They could be in a playful mood, or refuse to interact with\
  \ you. It is about appreciating the free will of the animal. We enjoy a stunning\
  \ sunrise, excitingly discussing how many dolphins we might see. One each would\
  \ be amazing, but even if it's just two dolphins we'd be more than happy. \n\nThe\
  \ boat slows down and someone squeals as we see a fin break the surface close to\
  \ our boat. Then another, and another. The speaker on top of the boat buzzes, before\
  \ a crackling voice says: \"It appears we have located a pod of approximately 400\
  \ dolphins.\" Wait... what?! We stare at each other in stunned silence. But there\
  \ is no time to adapt to this completely unexpected and overwhelming number of dolphins,\
  \ because the first two snorkelers are being asked to jump off the boat.\n\nAnd\
  \ here. I. go. \n\nFor a split second I look through the glass of my snorkel and\
  \ just see a turquoise square. The Jaws soundtrack threatens to enter my mind, but\
  \ then I'm surrounded by dolphins. They fly past from my right and left, and soar\
  \ underneath me. I gape - and swallow a mouthful of salt water. Coughing violently\
  \ I surface, only to see fins everywhere. It is magical. I quickly empty my snorkel\
  \ and dive under again.\n\nBefore I can open my mouth again in sheer amazement,\
  \ I remember to sing. Well, sing... I'm cooing at dolphins in a high-pitched voice.\
  \ Which makes me feel like a complete idiot, until I see a dolphin in front of me\
  \ slow down, look straight at me; and turn around.\n\nTrying to explain it won't\
  \ do it justice. When a wild animal decides to swim with you, being just as curious\
  \ about you as you are about them, is like nothing else. It makes you feel so small\
  \ but utterly alive.\n\nGo experience it. You won't be disappointed."
