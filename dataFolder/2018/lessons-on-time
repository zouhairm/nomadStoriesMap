Text: "Time waits for no man.  My grandmother often said these words to me. If my\
  \ grandmother were alive, I would take her to the Ethiopian countryside and show\
  \ her images of time standing still. \nBeyond the limits of Addis Ababa, pastoral\
  \ scenes reminiscent of distant times abound. Yoked bullocks plough fields. Women\
  \ thrash bleached stalks of grain. Streams of cows, donkeys, goats and sheep make\
  \ their way to pasture and traversing isolated landscapes seemingly devoid of life.\
  \ \nPeople work hard and everyone here works. Previously, children could not carry\
  \ heavy earthen ewers. The advent of the plastic-bottle revolution means that even\
  \ the tiniest pair of hands can carry a bottle of water. Families eke out a miserable\
  \ living through the continuous badgering of tired soils with the help of manual\
  \ tools hailing from another epoch. I descend the vehicle and talk to a laborer\
  \ nearby. His family works this land. He won\u2019t sell his produce. The market\
  \ is too far away.\nI had never seen so many self-possessed, miniature adults posing\
  \ as children. They carry water, fetch wood and tend cattle. Their conversations\
  \ mirror that of adults. Their games mimic adult preoccupations. In a tiny structure\
  \ behind the hut, a woman squats on her haunches and starts preparing a meal. She\
  \ does not look directly at me. She whispers harshly to the children who scatter\
  \ in all directions and proceed to go about their daily business. She then looks\
  \ at me and smiles a smile of recognition before returning to her tasks. Looking\
  \ at them, I am reminded of Galeano who once said that the truly poor do not know\
  \ that they are poor. Perhaps this accounts for their smiles, their hospitality\
  \ and the way they toil unreservedly; their only reward, the right to subsist. \n\
  After a few days, I felt stuck in a motion picture frame. The scene never changed.\
  \ The people repeated the same laborious gestures day after day against a backdrop\
  \ of languid blue skies. The scenery, the props, the dialogues; everything was identical\
  \ to that which had passed before. The only things that may have changed over time\
  \ were the protagonists. They enter the scene every 9 months and generally exit\
  \ every 40-55 years or so. On occasion, one may need an extra, but not very often,\
  \ and never for very long. I think I stumbled upon the exception to my grandmother\u2019\
  s old saying. I sat in my tent for three days and all throughout, I couldn\u2019\
  t shake the feeling that time was in fact waiting for these men and their circumstances\
  \ to change."
