Text: "My mom and I wanted a weekend getaway somewhere near General Rodriguez, where\
  \ we live. She told me that she had always wanted to go to Carhue, a city of Buenos\
  \ Aires, which name means \xB4green place\xB4.\nI had no idea where it was. She\
  \ told me that there were some well-known hot springs. I researched a bit and chose\
  \ a hotel with a thermal pool. That's how we decided to go to Carhu\xE9 on July\
  \ 7, without knowing what we were going to find.\nWe travel about seven hours. We\
  \ sing, we drink yerba mate, we listen to the silence of the field, we try to hook\
  \ a radio, we observe the small houses in the middle of the impressive hectares.\n\
  Carhu\xE9 is full of low houses, few places to eat and few businesses. In the afternoon\
  \ they nap nap, and on non-working days no one goes through the streets. The bikes\
  \ are loose, everyone helps each other, the people are hospitable like any hidden\
  \ place in Argentina. They take care of you, no matter where you are from.\nWe decided\
  \ to hire Norma Berg, a tour guide who, apparently, was the only one who made trips\
  \ to Epecu\xE9n, the neighboring city, a city covered by salty water.\nNorma arrived\
  \ at 14:30 sharp with a 4x4 truck. At that precise moment, this place, so inhospitable,\
  \ seduced us and remained in our hearts forever.\nEpecu\xE9n or \xB4eternal spring\xB4\
  , many years ago, was a tourist city, recognized by its lagoon Epecu\xE9n of healing\
  \ thermal waters. It received many tourists per year that were submerged in its\
  \ mirrored lagoon. But the city suffered a flood that forced its entire population\
  \ to evacuate, remaining alone and underwater.\nAfter more than twenty years the\
  \ water went down and the beautiful Epecu\xE9n was left, painted white by the salt,\
  \ with its trees made only trunks, without leaves, without green. It was no longer\
  \ an eternal spring.\nNorma, along with her family, had left Epecu\xE9n at age 18.\
  \ She showed us where his old house was and the important points of the town. Norma\
  \ spoke of Epecu\xE9n with love and her eyes got wet, blue eyes, darker than the\
  \ sky. The memories of his hard adolescence, seeing his house and all his city and\
  \ his life flooded, were reflected in his personality, in his way of speaking, in\
  \ his smile.\nNorma saw us and all the tourists who passed through Epecu\xE9n taking\
  \ pictures as if it were a tourist spot. But for her, it was the memory of a true\
  \ tragedy, already forgotten by all Argentines. \nWhen my mother invited me to Carhue\
  \ I thought we were going to a simple spa. But Epecuen flooded my whole body with\
  \ unforgettable memories."
