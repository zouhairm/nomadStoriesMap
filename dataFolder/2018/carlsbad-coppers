Text: "Silence. Everyone in the restaurant turned. Their eyes floated over my brother\
  \ and I. \u201CWe don\u2019t know you,\u201D said their curious glances. The flock\
  \ of vultures we had seen above Carlsbad on our way into town had been fortuitous.\n\
  \nI sported a full beard and a black and white checked button down. My brother,\
  \ unwhiskered, wore a bright yellow t-shirt. Perhaps our attire had betrayed our\
  \ West Coast origins.\n\nA group of policemen standing in the opposite corner seemed\
  \ to note us as we took our seats. The family at the table next to ours scooted\
  \ closer to their table. A middle aged man peered over his shoulder. The white of\
  \ his cowboy hat matched his mustache.\n\nOnce my brother and I were behind our\
  \ menus, the restaurant resumed its paces. I decided on my order soon enough. Around\
  \ us, the d\xE9cor suggested a couple steps forward from the 90s\u2019 farmhouse-revival\
  \ chic.  A Texas-lite twang filled the conversations. Given that we were just over\
  \ an hour\u2019s drive from the panhandle, this made some sense. The policemen had\
  \ taken their dinners to go. Our waitress stopped by to ask what we would like.\
  \ \n\nAfter dinner and dessert, my brother and I had stepped down from the curb\
  \ when a voice called from our left: \u201CEvening, gentlemen.\u201D\n\nWe turned.\
  \ A police cruiser stood just up from the doorway to the restaurant, window rolled\
  \ down. The officer on the driver\u2019s side kept on his shades and a welcome-to-town-stranger\
  \ smile. A fellow policeman sat on the passenger side. How long had they been waiting\
  \ there?\n\n\u201CEvening,\u201D my brother and I replied with ease, as we approached\
  \ the cops\u2019 car.\n\n\u201CWhat brings you guys into town here?\"\n\n\u201C\
  We were going to go and check out the caverns tomorrow,\u201D my brother said. This\
  \ was, in fact, true. And, when you consider that the Carlsbad Caverns are one of\
  \ the more heavily advertised National Parks in the US, this seems pretty reasonable.\n\
  \nThe driver\u2019s side officer followed up. Where are you two from? What\u2019\
  s the weather like there now? Staying in town tonight? Not original stuff, but I\
  \ suppose it gets the job done, answers being Seattle, rainy and cold, and yes-just-found-a-place-up-the-street.\
  \ Be sure to lock your car doors, they said.\n\nMy brother and I decided to banter\
  \ a bit with them. This display of theirs made sense. We were unknowns drifting\
  \ into town. Still, we felt compelled to provide an example of Seattle civility.\n\
  \n\u201CDo you know where we can get some good coffee?\u201D my brother asked. \n\
  \nThere were a couple spots they recommended."
