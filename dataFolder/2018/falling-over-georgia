Text: "When I decided to do something adventurous and daring for my birthday one year,\
  \ I had no idea it would put me at 14,000 feet in the sky with a man strapped to\
  \ my back, looking out over the North Georgia mountains and the Atlanta skyline.\
  \ Though that is exactly what happened.\n Before this day, I had never been on a\
  \ plane, but I had always wanted to go skydiving. I dreamed of being in the sky,\
  \ falling through clouds, feeling the wind whip past me during freefall, the exhilaration\
  \ of the earth coming quickly towards me. I wanted to fulfill that desire. \n My\
  \ friends and I went to Skydive Monroe for our adventure, an hour from Atlanta.\
  \ Once we signed in, received training, and waited for a while, we were flying high.\
  \ One by one, we left the safety of the plane, myself being last as I heard their\
  \ screams quickly get drowned out by wind and distance. When I kneeled at the edge\
  \ of the door, I saw crisp, open air. The roar of the plane's motor and the rush\
  \ of the wind drowning out every other sound. It was absolutely stunning. \n Upon\
  \ leaving the plane, I immediately fell through a cloud, into the ether. A split-second\
  \ blackout later and I was plummeting head first towards the ground. However, there\
  \ was no fear, only pure adrenaline as a smile was plastered on my face. 60 seconds\
  \ seems like a long time to be falling, but it sadly went by quickly.\n A quick\
  \ jolt as the chute opened was all I felt and everything stopped, now coasting downward.\
  \ In those awestruck moments, I admired mountain ranges, clouds, the Atlanta skyline,\
  \ and everything in between. There was no sound, no worries; I couldn't stop smiling.\
  \ I was truly at peace. Far below, I saw my friends, marked by their unique parachutes.\
  \ But, thankfully the fun wasn't over quite yet. Next, my instructor put me in control,\
  \ allowing me to steer. The daredevil in me had us doing spins, banking this way\
  \ and that, loving every exciting moment. Unfortunately, the adventure eventually\
  \ ended as we came to land, a fun corkscrew in the last moments before touching\
  \ earth once more as we slid to a stop on our butts. \n Since then, I have been\
  \ unsuccessful in my attempts to reproduce the tranquility I felt that day. There\
  \ is nothing nearly as breathtaking, thrilling, and serene as being in the sky without\
  \ the confines of metal surrounding you. My only wish is that others take the chance\
  \ to experience the same, telling themselves \u201CWhy not?\u201D before they take\
  \ that first step into oblivion."
