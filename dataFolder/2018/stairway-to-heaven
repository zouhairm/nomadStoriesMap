Text: "The soulful song of the first call to prayer was starting to fill the air as\
  \ I waited for my my friend that I affectionately call my Mysore bestie, to meet\
  \ me for our day\u2019s adventure.  There was no one on the streets yet, a rare\
  \ sight in India. It was a Sunday morning, and just barely 5am. We decided to make\
  \ the trek up the 1,008 steps of Chamundi Hill before we both departed back to our\
  \ native lands. Chamundi Hill is a pilgrimage site for many who come to Mysore.\
  \ At the top of the hill is Chamundeshwari Temple, a Hindu temple erected for the\
  \ goddess Chamundi, one of the avatars of Durga, a fierce goddess. My friend and\
  \ I were keen on discovering what Chamundi would have in store for us.  \n\nWe started\
  \ early in the morning to beat any of the afternoon heat, as well as to avoid any\
  \ crowds. As we climbed I was enamored with the sights. It was very much a microcosm\
  \ of modern India.   There were ancient altars along the path, but there were also\
  \ people running the steps training as well as devoted elders making their weekly\
  \ pilgrimages. But the people that remain etched in my memory was a young couple\
  \ that were making their pilgrimage together. They not only climbed the steps, which\
  \ were pretty steep, but they were adding vermillion powder to the steps with their\
  \ fingers as they went. They did it with such grace and love that as I watched in\
  \ awe I thought, I hope whatever their wish is, it comes true.  And then I thought\
  \ about all the vermillion smudges before I saw the couple, and all the people who\
  \ had done this before them. Chamundi Hill instantly felt just a little more magical.\
  \  \n\nI don\u2019t know what I originally thought would happen when we finally\
  \ got to the top, but it wasn\u2019t at all what I expected. The sun was finally\
  \ starting to really shine as my friend and I each bought our flower offerings to\
  \ give to the goddess Chamundi. We made our way through the temple to throw our\
  \ flowers to a small black statue in the altar. When we left the temple, I looked\
  \ at my friend and I knew we both felt renewed. We had spent a month assimilating\
  \ not only to India but to a strenuous yoga practice. Our bodies and minds were\
  \ constantly being pushed to the limit, and on that Sunday morning, we were rejuvenated.\
  \ It was the last thing I expected, but the very thing I most needed, very much\
  \ like India herself. I purchased a blessed mantra with some vermilion that I still\
  \ wear as a necklace to this day to remind me that the very thing you most need\
  \ will find you in the end."
