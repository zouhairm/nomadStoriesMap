Text: "I look at the ground when I walk. Too many things threaten to take me down.\
  \ This is not the case on Nepal\u2019s Annapurna Circuit, considered by many to\
  \ be the best long distance trek in the world. I haven\u2019t seen the ground in\
  \ days. My neck is tight and my eyes desperately squint for a break in the trees.\
  \ By this point, we had knelt at waterfalls, petted wild goats, and stumbled from\
  \ sweeping plains to high mountain passes. Still, we felt no closer to Kande.\n\n\
  I feel my heels bruise in my hiking boots, a thicker, deeper purple with every step.\
  \ Muddy laces lap at my ankles. I find comfort in the rhythm. The same comfort in\
  \ my pulsing fingers under the pressure of my rings. I push forward with every beat.\
  \ One more moment of this behind me. I am slick with morning rain and sweat. I can\u2019\
  t tell them apart. I drag the back of my hand across my forehead and smear it with\
  \ mud. It hardens instantly. The feeling gives me goosebumps. I was not prepared\
  \ for this. I am gripping a walking stick that belongs to an American man ahead\
  \ of me and a backpack that belongs to a Swiss woman behind me. My left knee is\
  \ under a bandage wrapped by one of our porters. My head in swimming in an Aspirin\
  \ handed to me by our tour guide. I am held together by these people. \n\nThere\
  \ are ten of us on this trek. Rattling breaths have replaced conversation and forced\
  \ smiles have replaced laughter. I am at the center of the pack. One of the older\
  \ porters walks alongside me with my weight in bags on his back. He shakes his grey\
  \ hair away from his eyes, adjusts the ropes on his shoulders, and asks me how I\u2019\
  m doing. I pant that I\u2019m better off than him and somehow still worse off. He\
  \ humbly chuckles and tells me that he does this every few weeks. I ask him how\
  \ he manages the pain. He asks me how I manage mine. Before I have a chance to answer,\
  \ he pulls me into a conversation about my home in Toronto, his home in Kathmandu,\
  \ his daughter, and my parents. A few hours later, he nudges me and nods his head\
  \ towards a path in the distance. This is how he manages his pain, he explains.\
  \ Love.\n\nAs soon as I realize what he means and where we are, I hoist my walking\
  \ stick across my shoulders, pull ahead of the pack, and race to the final set of\
  \ stone steps. I am the first one to reach the tea house in Dhampus Village. I collapse\
  \ onto the wet grass in exhilaration and spread my limbs across it. Eyes closed,\
  \ I laugh wildly into the air. When I open them, I fall silent. I have never seen\
  \ the sky before this moment."
