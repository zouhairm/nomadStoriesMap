Text: "I had decided to travel to India because I feared it; it was the country where\
  \ men married their daughters off to strangers and burned their wives with acid.\
  \ Not only was it a radical nation, I had arrived utterly and completely alone.\
  \ My thought had been\u2014get the toughest one out of the way and then you won\u2019\
  t be fearful of any other place you choose to go.   \n\nWhen I landed in Kolkata\
  \ I quickly understood I was in another planet, where the smog swallowed people,\
  \ and the people were endless constellations that left you breathless. I was hyperaware\
  \ of my insignificance in the universe while simultaneously understanding that each\
  \ particle in the crowd contributed to a thriving humanity. \n\nAs an American,\
  \ it was easy to make friends. It was hard to keep them. I had been jumping tables\
  \ at dinner each night, learning to eat with my hands. \n\nI met Anandi in the evening,\
  \ she caught me on the dinner line & introduced herself. \n\n\u201CHi, I\u2019m\
  \ Anandi. Dr. Panchali asked me to pick you up at the airport and show you around\
  \ but I was at the lab that day and couldn\u2019t go, I\u2019m so sorry!\u201D She\
  \ sported a short haircut, simple clothing, no makeup and wide, curious eyes.\n\
  \ \n\u201COh, it's ok! Great to meet you!\u201D I said, as I followed to her table\
  \ with my dhal & rice to continue our conversation. \n \nI learned she studied Ayurvedic\
  \ Medicine and spent half her time testing plants in the lab. A quiet soul. Our\
  \ spirits aligned and we fell in step, bonding over our passion for self-development,\
  \ love of nature and humanitarian efforts. She taught me how to meditate, never\
  \ once failing to ask,  \u201CHave you meditated today?,\u201D and inviting me to\
  \ her room to practice the exercises she loved. She taught me how to be patient,\
  \ to find time for the things that are most important and, she taught me how to\
  \ heal.\n \nWe traveled to the ancient river Ganga at sunset, where she would guide\
  \ me, a foreigner, into the depths of her life as an Indian girl.  We spoke of her\
  \ childhood, her hometown, her relationships, and the state of feminism. Anandi\
  \ quickly became the best friend I\u2019d ever had. Showing me repeatedly that as\
  \ long as light is within you, it will reflect in whom you meet and where you go.\
  \ Light attracts light, like magnets. That is why we were able to find each other.\n\
  \ \nWe parted with promises of long lasting friendship\u2014she would come to see\
  \ me in New York, and I would return to her when the universe permitted it. As only\
  \ the universe knew when the time would come."
