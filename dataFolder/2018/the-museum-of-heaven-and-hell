Text: "It\u2019s a sunny day in Salt Lake City, but I\u2019m missing it. Instead,\
  \ I\u2019m standing in a cavern twenty feet below street level, staring into the\
  \ jaws of hell. This is not a metaphor, either. The jaws of hell really exist. They\u2019\
  re ten blocks from the Mormon temple, near a diner-cum-mafia front. If you pass\
  \ by quickly, the building looks like the ramshackle auto shop it used to be. But\
  \ if you stop and take a beat, you\u2019ll find hints of what\u2019s inside: a concrete\
  \ plaque reading \u201CRalphael\u2019s Church School\u201D; handmade crucifixes;\
  \ and, above the door, a plaster goddess, her face demure but welcoming. If you\
  \ accept her invite and knock, the door might crack open, and you will meet Ralphael\
  \ himself\u2014his hair wild, his clothes covered in paint. He will not look surprised.\
  \ He will simply nod, then lead you down winding stairs into the basement. \u201C\
  This is hell,\u201D he will say, motioning to a hole in the wall ringed by sharp\
  \ teeth. He is asking if you want to go in. You nod, and go into the dark.\n\nAt\
  \ least, that\u2019s what I do. \n\nI do it because you have to go through hell\
  \ to get to heaven. This is not a metaphor, either. Ralphael, a former Mormon dissatisfied\
  \ by the Church\u2019s silence about the divine feminine, has created a rambling,\
  \ DIY museum for a female God he calls the Queen of Heaven. The resulting museum\
  \ represents that theology in sculptural form, its four floors ascending from purgatory\
  \ to a light-filled heaven four stories up. The journey between is guided by the\
  \ Queen herself, a swishy-haired creature who beckons from banisters, hangs from\
  \ rafters, and peers out of a lion's mouth. Walking, you sense that she\u2019s trying\
  \ to tell a story through Raphael as much as he is trying to tell one through her:\
  \ that in a town built on sameness, there is room for difference. That old stories\
  \ can be reshaped, retold. That outsiders can be insiders. \n\nI am here because\
  \ I am trying to believe that, because I was a Utah Mormon, too, before I left\u2014\
  tired of places where men were constantly in charge. I am back here, standing in\
  \ hell, because I\u2019m trying to understand what I left, wondering if exile is\
  \ a place or a condition.\n\nSo far, I am still in the basement, a river of groundwater\
  \ beneath me. I\u2019m suddenly spooked. I want to leave. But Ralphael shakes his\
  \ head. \u201COver here,\u201D he says, pointing to what looks like a small crevice.\
  \ \u201CI call this Escape from Egypt.\u201D And he\u2019s right: a few claustrophobic\
  \ moments of faith later, we are climbing out of captivity and into the light."
