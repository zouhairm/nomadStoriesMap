Text: "Miloli\u2019i is a small, unincorporated village, self-described as \u201C\
  the last Hawaiian fishing village\u201D.  A few years ago, my dad built a small\
  \ timber frame bungalow in a neighbouring subdivision. In lieu of a hedge, the property\
  \ is lined with prolific lilikoi (passionfruit) vines and agave plants. One Sunday\
  \ morning, I joined my father at the local church. I have to admit, I was a little\
  \ unsure. I never grew up going to church; in fact, religion itself is fairly foreign\
  \ to me. Upon arrival, I was welcomed with open arms, overwhelmed with well wishes,\
  \ and offered delicious freshly squeezed orange juice. After a sermon, three women\
  \ strummed ukuleles, serenading us with beautiful hymns in native Hawaiian. We ended\
  \ with a feast of fresh fruit and pork wrapped in taro leaves, an island favourite.\
  \ I felt a warmth that comes from feeling like part of a family. One of the young\
  \ boys, an impressively outgoing ten year old, asked us what we had planned for\
  \ the rest of our day. We told him we planned to go to Honomalino beach. His bright\
  \ face darkened suddenly. He warned us that on the path to Honomalino, there is\
  \ a shrine, and we must be silent as we pass it, lest we anger the spirits. If I\
  \ was skeptical, I hid it well. The young boy spoke with such severity that we assured\
  \ him we would obey. \nOne of the island\u2019s hidden gems, Honomalino beach, is\
  \ just a twenty minute hike from the church. The path winds along the coastline,\
  \ through lava rock and jungle, until it emerges to reveal a breaktaking bay; a\
  \ black sand beach decorated with coconut trees. The beach is pristine, secluded,\
  \ and sparsely attended. The water is warm, clean, and refreshing. \nWe had followed\
  \ the young boy's instructions, perhaps as more of an indulgence than out of true\
  \ belief. We were silent as soon as the shrine came into our view, and only resumed\
  \ speaking when it had left our sight. I thought no more about spirits. I had heard\
  \ stories about night marches, the ghosts of ancient Hawaiian warriors, but I dismissed\
  \ them as myths. That night, strange dreams came. I awoke to the sound of someone\
  \ walking on the lava-rock gravel outside. I heard the front door open and close.\
  \ I carefully crept out of bed. After loud snores from my father's room confirmed\
  \ he was sleeping deeply, I turned on the kitchen light. I searched the small house.\
  \ No one was there. Was it all just a dream? I had never been confused between dreaming\
  \ and reality. I started to wonder what I believed in."
