Text: "Her hands moved deftly and with reverence, tearing the petals and stems of\
  \ geranium flowers and folding them carefully into woven cloth. \u201CStand here\
  \ and close your eyes,\u201D she instructed. It was October and I had arrived in\
  \ Cuzco two days earlier to acclimate for a horseback trek in the Andes. I had wandered\
  \ from the Plaza de Armas into a courtyard flanked with small shops. Now I stood\
  \ in one of them with Berta, the fifth-generation owner, surrounded by handspun\
  \ alpaca wool and vibrant textiles. \u201CApu Ver\xF3nica, Apu Ausangate,\u201D\
  \ she murmured, calling upon sacred Inca spirits for my safe travel. Berta, with\
  \ her round face and striking black braids, shook the ceremonial bundle in the tradition\
  \ of her grandmother, moving it outward along my limbs and releasing staccato breaths\
  \ to bless my journey. Given the uncertainty of the next seven days, I welcomed\
  \ the luck. Our group would cover 40 miles of mountainous terrain outside Cuzco,\
  \ topping out at the 15,213\u2019 Salkantay pass and culminating at Machu Picchu.\
  \ \nThe trek removed us all from modernity. Quickly I sunk into a new way of life\
  \ \u2013 email and commute forsaken for sunshine, physical exertion and the smell\
  \ of wild mint. My mount, a sturdy quarter horse bred in Uruguay, carried me from\
  \ peak to valley, hooves cracking against rocky landscape. With each rhythmic step\
  \ I relaxed into the remote topography, worry dissolving from my shoulders. \nDay\
  \ three was the challenge and we woke early, ready for the pass. Up and further\
  \ up we followed each other on narrow switchbacks. \u201CStay tight to the mountain\
  \ here,\u201D our guide advised with a shout over his shoulder as we skirted a crumbling\
  \ section of trail. I trusted my horse but scrutinized dislodged stones as they\
  \ lurched down the slope. I let my breath go after navigating the precarious passage\
  \ and realized I had been holding it. Descending from the pass through towering\
  \ boulders into ancient Inca territory, I also realized I missed risk and its attendant\
  \ quickening pulse. \nInto cloud forest, then verdant valley we rode, first passing\
  \ avocado trees and later, noisy trucks. I understood, reluctantly, that our curative\
  \ isolation neared its end. Machu Picchu was extraordinary, but the assault of tourists\
  \ shocked. I came to Peru for that sanctuary, but the trek to reach it transcended\
  \ the destination itself. \nOn the tarmac in Lima, Berta\u2019s ceremony flashed\
  \ in my memory. I saw her clear eyes and knew she played a role. More than just\
  \ safe, my journey had been exceptionally blessed."
