Text: "Bodies dripping wet, looks of relief on some faces, others laughing, should\
  \ have warned me for what was coming!  At the best of times being on water out of\
  \ my depth was something that I just don't do.  I don't live by Nike's 'just do\
  \ it' when I am on water.  The orange life jacket was done up extra tight, would\
  \ it help if I really went under.  What if the boat did upturn?  Everyman for themselves.\
  \  Why did I ever succumb to this?  Well, the weather was good, the sun shining,\
  \ others seemed to have enjoyed themselves on the boats preceding us.\n\nMy knees\
  \ started to shake as I wondered would it be safer to sit at the front of the boat.\
  \ No, common sense would be that you would be thrown about. In the middle you would\
  \ get wet, really wet - just look at those on the boat coming in to the dock now.\
  \  If I sat at the back, it should be fine.  Or should it? All these thoughts going\
  \ through my muddled mind! I was scared, really scared.  I chose the back row! Too\
  \ late to change, the boat had filled up.\n\nThat slow movement away from the dock\
  \ was just teasing my mind.  It could not get any worse.  The sun was still shining,\
  \ the waterfall glimmering.\nWhat was that sudden thrust? It had started, that slow\
  \ movement now turning into hell on water.  Sharp movements to the right, then to\
  \ the left, all on the boat screaming with delight.  I can't see in front of me,\
  \ oh my eyes are closed, tightly closed and they are not going to open.  \n\nSoaked\
  \ to the skin in just a few minutes.  My heart is pounding with fear.  Another dumb\
  \ decision that was pushing me to the edge.  Screams to the left, I can't see my\
  \ eyes are closed, are we safe or are we going under.  A sudden turn and we are\
  \ dumped on I presume we have just got as close to the waterfall as we can get.\
  \  More screams.  More laughter.  Are they serious? How can one laugh when you are\
  \ soaked to the skin being thrown from one side of the boat to another? They are\
  \ seeing what is going on.  My eyes are not going to open till I am back on dock.\
  \  Fear, total fear.  How can one explain what one feels when there is total fear.\
  \ \n\nMy mind heads to the small train that runs around the park - that is what\
  \ I should have just stuck to!  Just like a child a gentle ride, probably a bit\
  \ of a let down.  I am an adult.  I should be able to handle fear.  Screams again\
  \ and I shudder.  The boat is suddenly slowing down, I can feel the gentle lap of\
  \ waves at the side of me as we slide into dock. They don't call this the Devils\
  \ Throat for nothing!"
