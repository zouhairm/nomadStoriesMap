Text: "I sat down on the ground and started to listen. Listen to the sound of wind\
  \ and waves crashing on the rocks. I asked myself what exactly brought me there,\
  \ to the edge of the world, the place, as written by Portuguese poet Lu\xEDs de\
  \ Cam\xF5es, \u201Cwhere the land ends and the sea begins\u201D, Cabo da Roca.\n\
  I was 17, working in one of the Cracow's main square restaurants in Old Town. I\
  \ started that job to get the feeling of doing something, as I thought, that if\
  \ I keep doing nothing, nothing will never change for me. The only thing I enjoyed\
  \ about working there was people, who were coming to our place to have a traditional\
  \ polish dinner, usually, ordering \"pierogi\" (polish dumplings) as the main meal\
  \ with local vodka \"Soplica\". They were summing up their emotions after the day\
  \ in one of the most mysterious cities in Eastern Europe, while I was curious why\
  \ so many people from all over the world come to see this place, as I strongly believed\
  \ in my country, Ukraine, there are many undeservingly less popular places, where\
  \ tourists from abroad are mostly seemed to be an exception from the rules. That\
  \ time I did not find my own answer, but I found out something much more important\
  \ to me. I got the feeling that I need to go on the road.\nIn one day I gave up\
  \ on that job, passed the last exam in my uni and booked the cheapest possible flight\
  \ from Cracow, as I did not really care where to go, but the fact that I need to\
  \ explore. Accidentally and fortunately, that flight was to low-cost Paris airport\
  \ situated 80km to the north of the French capital in a provincial town of Beauvais.\
  \ I got my 500$ in cash, my backpack with a tent and started a month-long journey\
  \ just after I turned 18, which was such an amazing gift to myself.\nIn the beginning,\
  \ I had no plan of my moves, but while checking the cheapest bus-tickets from Paris\
  \ I found the one for just 2 Euros to Bordeaux, the capital of the same-called french\
  \ province in the south-west of the country. I spend some time looking for possible\
  \ hosts on Couchsurfing, who later became my free personal guides in burgeois France,\
  \ after what I hitchhiked to explore unexplored Basque country, Asturias, Galicia\
  \ and later Porto, Coimbra and finally Lisbon, next to where I was sitting on the\
  \ edge of the most western point of the Eurasian continent.\nJust sitting and thinking\
  \ of what I had come through and where I was at that particular moment, celebrating\
  \ my life.\nThe life, where goals have no sense without the actual process of achieving\
  \ them."
