Text: "Then we met her.\n\nLudmila. \n\nHer name formed to her. As if she\u2019d chosen\
  \ it. \n\nA sky-blue platok swaddled her chubby face, like little blue riding hood,\
  \ ostracizing a forehead full of curling ashen bangs.\n\nWe were smuggled cargo,\
  \ smashed between old Russian women, busting Tupperware out of crinkled sacks. \n\
  \n\u201CWhat\u2019s her name?\u201D little-sky-blue-riding-hood pleaded, using a\
  \ much frailer woman\u2019s legs as cushions. Almost laying, to get closer. \n\n\
  \u201CVera.\u201D\n\nHer face spoke before she did. \u201CThat\u2019s Russian!\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CShe\u2019s so krasivaya,\u201D she continued, staring at Vera, her eyes\
  \ gleaming with memory, wet with the past. Perhaps a daughter. Or a daughter that\
  \ had been, before. \"I'm Ludmila.\"\n\n\"Ochen priyatna. I'm Ben. And yes, she\
  \ is beautiful,\" I agreed. Me, too, now gazing at her, filling with memories. \n\
  \nThe small boat\u2014the one we weren't supposed to be on, but were\u2014spit and\
  \ popped into action, gurgling water, as we crawled away from the dock.\n\nThe pink\
  \ horizon melted, on the milky, smooth water out the submarine windows behind our\
  \ heads. Long wrinkles tightened in the sheet of brightening silk behind us, opening.\
  \ \n\n\"I\u2019m going to sing her a song,\" Ludmila declared.\n\nFive Russian ballads\
  \ later, Ludmila having closed her eyes and touched her chest, then Vera's chest,\
  \ in multiple songs, as if to say, you don't need to understand the words: feel\
  \ them\u2014after all that, we inched across the open sea, the back end sagging\
  \ into the water, ten people over capacity. A trail of white diamonds, left behind\
  \ by the sun, led to a hazy island. The trailhead beamed on the railing, where we\
  \ discussed life and love and religion, with Ludmila. \n\nMe translating, Vera nodding,\
  \ asking me to ask.\n\nAnd, like that, discussing love, life, religion, with Ludmila,\
  \ who\u2019d only been a hand inviting us onto a boat, a boat we shouldn\u2019t\
  \ have been on, exactly two hours ago\u2014like that, we distanced ourselves from\
  \ the silent scream of the Solovyetski Islands. Harbored from its ambient past,\
  \ by the warmth of a Ruskaya dusha. \n\nThe same Russian soul which had steadied\
  \ its flame in Solzhenitsyn, too, during his imprisonment on these very islands:\
  \ \u201Cknow languages, know countries, know people.\u201D\n\nAnd for the first\
  \ time in three days, no longer trapped, on an island off which we\u2019d been told\
  \ no boats would depart until summer, six months from when we\u2019d arrived, for\
  \ the first time since then, we hugged and took photos with \u201Cothers who were\
  \ alive, who were traveling [our] road, whom we could join to [ourselves] with the\
  \ joyous word \u2018we.\u2019\u201D"
