Text: "10 portuguese guys from an academic musical group in a travel through Switzerland.\
  \ The next stop is a little village near Geneve, Switzerland, in the day of the\
  \ World Cup 2014 semis, Brazil vs. Germany. We didn't know what to expect, and it\
  \ turned out to be the best night of our trip.\nWith the help of a local contact\
  \ it was possible for us to spend the night here. Our host had everything prepared\
  \ to receive us and gave us a barn to spend the night.\nSo, what ? We are spending\
  \ the night at a barn? First surprise was, the barn had awesome conditions, two\
  \ floors and everyone of us had it own straw bale, ready to make us despise some\
  \ of the beds we had in the past few days.\nSecond surprise happened when our host\
  \ told us the game will be projected in that barn for all the people in the village.\
  \ All set up for kick-off, the locals provided us with a delicious craft beer and\
  \ grilled meat. \nSuddenly, we were in the middle of a local tradition, every match\
  \ day, the entire village join to watch the game with drink, food, and a lot of\
  \ happiness and good mood.\nThe match starts, the portuguese boys cheering up for\
  \ Brazil and our hosts as naturals from the German part of Switzerland were waiting\
  \ for a German victory. Early in the game, 1-0 for Germany and we feel like an aliens\
  \ as we were the only ones not celebrating that goal. A few minutes later the second\
  \ goal and this is when I realize my friends are out there screaming the German\
  \ goals too. At that moment, we were in just for the fun and every goal revealed\
  \ a new toast. At the end seven german goals celebrated for zero german borned persons.\n\
  The party proceeded sharing hometown stories, playing some music and making several\
  \ new friends in that village. In the next day we talked about this lovely night\
  \ in the middle of nowhere when no one of us barely expected it.\nIn that day we\
  \ realize how easy is to connect  to someone, just get together some beer, some\
  \ food, watch sports or play your music, just do it with a smile, that's the universal\
  \ language and will work out  well most of the time."
