Text: "\u201CNo way...\u201D I was keep telling myself while approaching the building.\
  \ After 3 days of walking on the mountain\u2019s highest slopes, the only thing\
  \ I was wishing right now was a good bed and a hot meal. \nI was with my friends\
  \ on a seven days hike on the main Fagaras ridge, a 70 km long trail on the highest\
  \ mountains of Romania.  I planned carefully every day, from where to start, how\
  \ long to walk and where to sleep. Due to the facts that most of the shelters were\
  \ situated at a much lower altitude than the trail, every night we have to decent\
  \ and every morning we had to climb back to reach our path.\nThat day we reached\
  \ the half of our journey and we were happy because the weather was good to us,\
  \ the shelter was closer and we were reaching the B\xE2lea Lake, a very touristic\
  \ spot on the Transf\u0103g\u0103r\u0103\u015Fan road. But the secrete behind our\
  \ joy was that we were reaching the civilization after days of eating our dry food\
  \ so we were dreaming of big delicious portions of carbohydrate food.  \nAll my\
  \ dreams vanished in front of this shelter that was looking like a barn. To reach\
  \ it we crossed the tunnel under the mountain and, on this side, the entire valley\
  \ was covered with thick fog and the air was smelling like rain. We could only see\
  \ a tiny fraction of the road that goes to Vidraru dam. Stuck to the mountain wall\
  \ a weird house that was supposed to be our home for tonight was awaiting us. \n\
  While we were approaching, a kind man appeared from the house and invited us inside.\
  \  The main room was decorated in a Romanian traditional style and, in the middle\
  \ of it, from a rustic chemin\xE9e, a good fire was warming the place up and spreading\
  \ in the air the smell of fresh burning wood. While we were waiting for the food,\
  \ the host offered us a very good homemade blueberry alcohol, which is a very common\
  \ tradition in Romania. My friends and I were absolutely speechless. Finally, the\
  \ food arrived and it was beyond delicious. I am not sure if it was like this because\
  \ of the dry food I had in the past days or because of the fact that it was served\
  \ in these ceramic dishes that are perfect to keep and enrich the flavors.   \n\
  We were tired after all the hiking so soon we went to sleep. In the morning, I opened\
  \ my eyes and see in front of my bed how the clouds were dispersed by the wind and\
  \ under them, the entire valley was appearing. \nThe experiences I had here were\
  \ the last things I expected when entering. I understood that, if you give it a\
  \ chance, even a strange place can surprise you."
