Text: "We walked along \u0130stiklal street and ended up Taksim square, the heart\
  \ of Istanbul, and a critical space for Turkish culture, lifestyle and politics.\
  \ So vital, that when the government had announced they would build homes in its\
  \ place, the people took to the streets to protest. \n\nAs I stared at the statue\
  \ of Mustafa Ataturk in the center of the square, a man approached my mother and\
  \ I. In America, when a strange man walks up to you, you move away or pretend you\
  \ don't see him. This man however, began to give us a history lesson in English!\
  \ He told us how Ataturk was a military victor, the father of modern Turkey and\
  \ how the statue was a gift by the Italians. \n\nHe then asked where we're from,\
  \ usually a signal to run, but we responded, \"California.\" \n\n\"No. Where are\
  \ you really from?\" He said.\n\nI always find this question amusing; some ask to\
  \ remind you of your roots, others to create a bond of linage. \"Egypt\" I said.\
  \ \n\nIt turned out he was Syrian. We chatted for a bit, he told us that Syrian\
  \ refugees were common in Turkey, housing over 2 million who fled from war and devastation,\
  \ forced to start over on foreign soil. I couldn't believe how many had been displaced,\
  \ only a fraction of those who were forced to run, but glad the country would give\
  \ sanctuary when others had turned their back.\n\nIt began to rain. My mother pointed\
  \ to an old metro tunnel for us to take shelter; we parted with the kind man and\
  \ ran in. \n\nWhat looked like an unappealing, cement, underground Turkish metro\
  \ from the outside turned out to be a beautiful, intricately detailed railway tunnel,\
  \ filled with vibrant Islamic style art. Taken aback by the detail, we realized\
  \ we'd quickly lost our way in the miles long transit. \n\nWe stumbled by a small\
  \ shop with a man offering us goods. Unfortunately, neither my mother nor I spoke\
  \ Turkish and had no luck using sign language. The Turkish man grinned; he began\
  \ to walk away, and turned for us to follow. Alone in the shop, we were a bit nervous.\
  \ To our confusion, he walked us over to his Apple computer, opened Google translate\
  \ and stepped aside for us to type.\n\nAs absurd as it sounds, his determination\
  \ to understand was the last thing I expected. I felt sorry having assumed he had\
  \ an ulterior motive, and having brought my domestic skepticism and guard to a country\
  \ that exuded generosity even from its refugees. Kindness without the expectation\
  \ of gain was a foreign concept to me. Suddenly I understood how travel was also\
  \ an examination of perspective."
