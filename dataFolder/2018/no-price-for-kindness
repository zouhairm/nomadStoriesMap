Text: "Menengai Crater, part of the Great Rift Valley, extends to the edge of Nakuru\
  \ town located in the central-western region of Kenya. It was morning and already\
  \ hot when I arrived to the top of the Crater. I had lived in Nakuru for two months\
  \ but hadn\u2019t yet visited the extensive park area, so I was due for a trip.\
  \ The official park entrance where the main road reaches is not far from the town\
  \ centre, but I wanted to try a different way up. A pikipiki (motorcycle taxi) took\
  \ me on a side route which bypasses the park entrance fees and loops a few kilometers\
  \ away from the designated parking at the top. \n I began to walk along the widest\
  \ looking trail there was, but only ten minutes later my path began to branch into\
  \ several more lines in the grass, no longer passable as trails. That was when I\
  \ noticed a boy there. He was a tiny kid, I\u2019m guessing around six or seven\
  \ years old; he didn\u2019t have shoes but did style a baggy t-shirt and shorts\
  \ with a good number of holes. He was by himself but looked like he was from the\
  \ area\u2014as opposed to myself who was an obviously lost tourist. He began by\
  \ saying a few things in Kiswahili but my vocabulary was embarrassingly limited.\
  \ There is only so much that gestures can communicate, but I did get one word he\
  \ said: \u201Cbarabara\u201D which means road. So I smiled and nodded to that, then\
  \ followed him when he turned around to walk away. \n I don\u2019t know how he knew\
  \ to take me down, nor why he decided to help me, but he did and I\u2019ll admit\
  \ I was quite shocked with the whole situation during the time we hiked together.\
  \ The trail was steep and rocky, but it was second nature to him and he knew exactly\
  \ which branches of the trail were better than others. I would definitely never\
  \ have made it down alone. Two very sweaty hours later I reached the bottom of Menengai\
  \ Crater with my six-year-old local tour guide to whom I paid a heavy price of the\
  \ three bananas and avocado I carried with me. We spent only a little while at the\
  \ base\u2014enough time to finish up the food in my bag before we climbed back up.\
  \ I got his name which sounded like Waishira but in all honesty I won\u2019t ever\
  \ know exactly who he was, or even whether I\u2019ve spelled his name right. I wish\
  \ I could have offered him more than fruits, and I wish I could have told him what\
  \ a kind and excellent companion he was for me. I went back two times after that,\
  \ but never ran into him again. Now all I can do is share this story of the spectacular\
  \ young kid who helped me to the bottom of Menengai Crater."
