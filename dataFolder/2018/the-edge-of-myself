Text: "As I closed my eyes, the smell of copa blanco filled the room. There were flowers\
  \ and crystals adorning each entrance of the Osho Hall. My hands touched the cool\
  \ marble floor, and I could feel the sense of sacred space where about 100 people\
  \ would take a journey with the medicine. There was a warm wind blowing through\
  \ the trees and the insects\u2019 everpresent tone kept the rythym of my heart beating\
  \ softly. \u201CHow did I get here?\u201D I thought to myself in the melody of a\
  \ song that begins with those words. A question I often asked on these days of solo\
  \ travel. \n There were countless decisions that brought me here, but the main one,\
  \ the one to turn my life upside down was made months before; the decision to leave\
  \ the life I once knew. A cozy yellow house with a white picket fence steps to the\
  \ beach, my boyfriend and dog, the 9-5 job. There were times when I wanted to return\
  \ to that safety net, but now there was no turning back. I was on a mission of self\
  \ discovery through the exploration of the world around me, the culture, and coming\
  \ in tune with my most authentic self through experience. A solo time, where I would\
  \ not be defined by the standard life I found myself in. I needed to find out what\
  \ else I was made of and what else was out there. \n Echoes of memories, fantasies\
  \ of the future, and the continuation of coming back into the present moment swirled\
  \ around my monkey mind as portuguese medicine music beat along my ear drums. The\
  \ guides would continue to play all throughout the night as a way to ground the\
  \ journey; to have something to come back to if you strayed too far. \n\n\u201C\
  Lets go become better people\u201D, he said, looking knowingly into my eyes as our\
  \ palms touched. We were sending each other off into the unknown to gather more\
  \ experiences as individuals and evolving selves. \n\nComing here was a decision\
  \ brought on by synchronicities on my path to open up to the unknown through spiritual\
  \ community and the deep inner alchemical work of the soul.  It was my third night\
  \ since arriving. I was diving in. It was as if the universe was conspiring in my\
  \ favor to take these steps towards transformation. There were many glimpses of\
  \ realization from the spirit of the medicine. \nAs I came back from the long journey\
  \ within, so the day began. The golden rays of the early morning sun danced across\
  \ the evergreen jungle as did all the beautiful souls dressed in white. \nThe decision\
  \ to say yes to the experience of life pushed me to the edge, the edge of myself."
