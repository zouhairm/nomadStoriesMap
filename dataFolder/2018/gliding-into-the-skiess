Text: "The time when i was almost about suffocate myself in work, i decided to take\
  \ a break of two days in order to get myself in my senses. The only thing I could\
  \ think of was mountains and inhaling fresh air into my lungs.\n\nThat is when i\
  \ came across a eye catching Para- Gliding pics of few people, there i was this\
  \ was the place i wanted to escape from work and go to..\n\nI decided to take local\
  \ public transport to reach my destination.  was memorised by the beauty of Bir\
  \ and Biling located in Himachal Pradesh.  The mountains were full of greenery and\
  \ colourful flowers. My eyes were already feeling sense of relaxation. We decided\
  \ to trek from Bir to reach the para gliding point which was almost 8000 ft. above\
  \ the ground level. Then the journey started through puzzled routes. the trek involved\
  \ seeing monkeys and cliffs and rock climbing. It almost took 4 hours to reach on\
  \ the top. By then it was already night and we decided to stay in camp for the night\
  \ so that we could do gliding in the morning. In the nights it was like we were\
  \ in the sky could see every stars so close to us, as we could hold in our hand\
  \ and make a wish. Nothing seemed impossible by then. \n\nNext day morning we woke\
  \ up with a beautiful view of Sunrise and we could see the para gliding point as\
  \ well.  This was the time for I was there, no fear but lot of anxiety. Had never\
  \ done this before. having all this thoughts in mind,  we jumped from the cliff\
  \  with para- gliding bag.... and there it was in the middle of the sky and land.\
  \ Could have not thought or asked for anything better. Seeing every bird, every\
  \ mountain and every temple and human development from the sky was just beyond one\
  \ eyes imagination. After a good 1 and half hour flight we landed  and could not\
  \ believe that i did this... my heart was full of happiness and calmness which i\
  \ wanted. \n\nThis was my best vacation and i glided into the skies...!!!"
