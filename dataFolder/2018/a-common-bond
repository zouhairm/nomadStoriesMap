Text: "High across the valley, the ruin of Monts\xE9gur began to appear as the sun\
  \ burned through the mist.  Steam rose from the ground below. In the distance, you\
  \ could just make out the outline of the Pyrenees on the Spanish border. \n \u2018\
  Laisse! Leave it,\u2019 a voice boomed from nowhere. \n Half-hypnotised, I hadn\u2019\
  t noticed the huge white dog sniffing round my rucksack. The dog strolled off towards\
  \ his owner. \n  \u2018Ahh. Sentier Cathare,\u2019 said the man. I nodded. Today\
  \ would be my last day hiking the 250km trail of Cathar castles from the Mediterranean\
  \ to Foix, capital of the Ari\xE8ge. The man held out his hand, \u2018Bertrand,\
  \ and this is Max.\u2019 he said, scratching the dog behind his ear. \u2018I\u2019\
  ll walk with you.\u2019\n I didn\u2019t refuse. I thought I\u2019d be glad of the\
  \ company.  As we climbed the hill he started to laugh at my red shopping bag that\
  \ I swung from side to side.\n \u2018No, No. Put it in the rucksack.\u2019 \n I\
  \ tried to explain it was easier to reach my supplies without stopping. He laughed\
  \ again. I think he was amazed I had gotten this far. \n He said he was retired,\
  \ and spent his time watching rugby, fishing or taking Max for walks.  \u2018Ten\
  \ kilometres every day.\u2019\n I found it hard to believe. Bertrand must have been\
  \ at least thirty pounds heavier than me.  I reminded him about Ireland\u2019s recent\
  \ victory over France in the Six Nations rugby. \n \u2018I don\u2019t care about\
  \ the national team, only Toulouse,\u2019 he said. \n The path steepened again.\
  \ He looked at me in despair as I struggled to keep up.\n \u2018You need walking\
  \ poles.\u2019 \n \u2018Another thing to carry,\u2019 I replied. \n Up ahead, I\
  \ could see some sort of monument: a dagger in a clenched fist with a list of names\
  \ on a pillar below  \u2013 a memorial to Resistance fighters killed by the Germans.\
  \  I noticed one of the names had been permanently covered. When I asked Bertrand\
  \ he gave an open-palmed shrug.  Later, after some research, I found out it was\
  \ the name of a collaborator.\n \u2018My father was in the Resistance,\u2019 said\
  \ Bertrand.  I pointed to the names. He shook his head. \n \u2018My grandfather\
  \ \u2026 Normandy,\u2019 I said, searching for the correct French.\n Bertrand smiled.\
  \ We shared a common bond. Somehow, through the acts of my grandfather, I had gained\
  \ his respect. We stood to attention, the sun glistening off the marble, remembering\
  \ the sacrifices of our respective relatives.  Max sat still between us. I thought\
  \ about all the torment, this beautiful region of forests, vineyards and mountains\
  \ had been through.  I smiled back at Bertrand. Neither of us needed to say anything\
  \ more."
