Text: "I was navigating myself through the back alleys of old town Dubrovnik, in search\
  \ for space and true character to be revealed. Then, glancing back down behind me,\
  \ I stopped to take a photo at the top of the stairs.\n\n\"Best street in the city,\
  \ yeah?\" said an older man with a salty beard and kind eyes, reminding me of my\
  \ father. \n\nI'm sure he's seen it being captured millions of times by now. \n\n\
  We began to chat, or tried to in the midst of the language barrier. He insisted\
  \ I sit on his bench. He was selling cold drinks and an assortment of small souvenirs.\
  \ He asked me what I wanted, and offered me it for free. I continued then to sit\
  \ by him, drinking an ice tea, learning more about him as tourists passed by - eying\
  \ his mini fridge while the hot sun beated down. \n\nHe is only one of the 700 who\
  \ lived in the old town of Dubrovnik today. The rest is now filled with apartments,\
  \ hotels, etc. He has been selling his items and drinks to tourists for 7 years\
  \ during the summer time, but been living there for over 50 years. \n\nI was going\
  \ to give up on Dubrovnik short after arriving, quick to judge it by it's tourists\
  \ and over photographed beauty. I took plenty of photos that compositionally and\
  \ visually may be appealing, but this encounter was just another reminder of how\
  \ much human connection and photographs of people mean to me. He completely changed\
  \ my impression of the city, showing me there is still something true beneath the\
  \ exploitation of the city caused by the mass amount of cruise ships."
