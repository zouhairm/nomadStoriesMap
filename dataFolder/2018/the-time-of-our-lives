Text: "The sun was brilliant, blinding, even at dusk; especially at dusk, when it\
  \ was sinking beneath the ocean, it\u2019s rays bouncing off the cerulean waters.\
  \  The heat enveloped you as if to constantly remind you of it\u2019s dominance\
  \ this close to the equator.  Not that you could ever forget; when you\u2019re used\
  \ to overcast skies and the dull daily chill, a comforting warmth is not something\
  \ you take for granted.\n\nI\u2019d read how you could walk the entire perimeter\
  \ of Gili Air in just an hour and a half, but despite it\u2019s modest size, you\u2019\
  re still somehow able to find yourself solitary on stretches of sand that spread\
  \ seemingly onwards for miles.   It\u2019s hard to be distracted when the glowing\
  \ sun embarks on it\u2019s journey below the horizon right in front of you, but\
  \ I was distracted by a figure on the dusty kerb.  His tanned torso was bent low\
  \ over a multitude of wooden plaques, each delicately embellished with an intricate\
  \ wooden carving.  Sensing my curiosity, Nyoman and I began a fragmented conversation,\
  \ the value of which I carry with me every day.\n\nI  discovered it \u201Cmight\
  \ be\u201D Nyoman\u2019s birthday tomorrow - his father says so, but his mother\
  \ is adamant it isn\u2019t until January.   More perplexing still was that this\
  \ confusion seemed to bother me more than Nyoman himself.  How can you not know\
  \ your age - or, furthermore, how can you not mind not knowing your age?!  \u201C\
  It makes no difference to me how old I am,\u201D he stated concisely.  His words\
  \ hung still in the air, echoing the tranquility of the approaching evening.  Here\
  \ I am, stood before Nyoman, younger than he is and yet feeling the weight of growing\
  \ older hovering low over my head like a dense cloud, bringing with it all the suffocating\
  \ pressures of what to achieve and when to have achieved it by; a ticking time bomb,\
  \ forever pushing me towards whatever is next on my to-do list without offering\
  \ precious time to stop and appreciate all the joys I\u2019ve previously experienced\
  \ and the moment I\u2019m in right now.\n\nUnconcerned with the frivolities of birthdays,\
  \ Nyoman sits peacefully, savouring the journey of the sun, fulfilling his passion,\
  \ occupying his mind and honouring his artistic talent by creating these ornaments\
  \ to sell right here on the street.  Time passes with him calmly doing what he enjoys,\
  \ greeting each morning as it comes and not viewing it as just one of many in a\
  \ year, a decade, an era\u2026 a bullet point in a check-list.  To see each new\
  \ day as it\u2019s own unique, special gift is the most valuable present I could\
  \ ever receive."
