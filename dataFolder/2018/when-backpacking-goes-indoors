Text: "It was raining in the desert. I had watched the dark cloud get closer and closer\
  \ as the night began, making the golden colors of dusk become dark and monochrome.\
  \  \nMy brother, Alex, had just graduated from college and we had a few weeks to\
  \ visit as many national parks as we could. We decided to go to Utah; days spent\
  \ exploring in the orange deserts and nights camped under the stars. We had wondered\
  \ into Moab after spending a day hiking and wandering around Arches National Park.\n\
  Tonight was the night we had planned a hotel. Only a mishap with the booking left\
  \ us almost $100 short and a room that had been booked for a night some three weeks\
  \ previously. After a week of sleeping in a windy tent in any spot of public land\
  \ we could find, we were tired and in desperate need of a hot shower.\nIn frustration,\
  \ Alex had walked away. He had made the booking and we were both tired, hungry,\
  \ unsure of what to do next. Although we were twins, we are complete opposites.\
  \ I was a planner, slow to walk and enthusiastic about stopping for the moment.\
  \ He didn\u2019t care where our next meal came from as long as we had climbed to\
  \ the top of whatever mountain was tallest in the vicinity. We had done well so\
  \ far: he only teased when I insisted we stop to buy toilet paper and snacks before\
  \ heading out into the wild, when I forced sunscreen onto his freckling ears, and\
  \ I never paused when he picked a trail we had no idea how much distance we were\
  \ about to cover.  But now I realized we had reached a point where the adventurous\
  \ spirit had been dampened by a little slap of reality. \nThe fat, cold raindrops\
  \ were falling with increasing frequency.\nHe came back sooner than I had expected\
  \ with two tiny pieces of receipt paper in his hand. He had gotten tickets for us\
  \ to go to the movies. We drove over to the tiniest theater I had ever seen. We\
  \ usually make a point to not do anything we could do at home while we're somewhere\
  \ new; have to try the local foods only or take in the sights. But eating that buttery\
  \ popcorn and sitting in comfy seats seemed like a luxury. Even better, the rain\
  \ had stopped.\nA local from the theater had told us where we could go to camp some\
  \ ways out of town. We set up the tent in the dark, chatting about the parts of\
  \ the movie we had liked best.\nThe next morning, the sun rose and we woke to the\
  \ most incredible view of the desert and mountains. To think, if we had gotten the\
  \ hotel we'd be waking up to a back alley or car-park. Sometimes, things have a\
  \ way of working out."
