Text: "I was once homeless for a spell and living in my car. I should clarify: I was\
  \ homeless in the privileged sense, in that it was my own choice.\nI was introduced\
  \ to rock climbing at UCSD. Originally, it was a combination of my love of the sport\
  \ and disillusionment with the sanitized approach to life and learning I saw on\
  \ campus which lead me to turn to the backroads of America. I suppose idealist-me\
  \ craved the \u201Creal\u201D America, the mountains, rivers and rocks, and rejected\
  \ the people I saw living for work in the city. So I hit the road. It was not the\
  \ glamorized #vanlife seen on Instagram, I ate way too many canned beans for that,\
  \ but it gave me access to a whole new beautiful world. It was only in these wild,\
  \ uncivilized places that I began to fall back in love with people.\nThe outdoor\
  \ climbing community is small and frequents the same places and campgrounds. Two\
  \ such campgrounds were the affectionately named \u201CPit\u201D outside of Bishop,\
  \ CA and \u201CThe Bivy\u201D at Smith Rock, OR. At the end of each day, people\
  \ from all over would gather to share food, beer, stories and laughter. And alternatively,\
  \ after that first campfire-coffee in the morning, the connectedness of the night\
  \ before was jokingly lost as we\u2019d race each other to the \u201Cpit\u201D toilet;\
  \ nobody wanted to be the last to the loo.\nAt the Bivy, I remember a young concert\
  \ cellist who, suffering from burnout, had taken her cello on the road to \u201C\
  feel the earth under her feet\u201D again and reconnect with the world on a visceral\
  \ level. That night, while we lounged around the fire, she put her $30k instrument\
  \ in the dirt, and played Bach\u2019s Cello Suite Prelude No. 1, the notes reverberating\
  \ off the nearby cliffs. The entire campground sat around the fire in silence long\
  \ after she\u2019d finished, most of us in tears, as we listened to the sounds of\
  \ the crickets slowly crescendo back into their natural hum. Even they had paused\
  \ to listen. \nGood people came and went, like a revolving family circus of hitch-hikers,\
  \ jugglers, musicians \u2013 all of them climbers. The camaraderie between us is\
  \ hard to put into words. Magic, maybe? There was just something so compelling and\
  \ inclusive about it. Women, men, people of color, amateurs and pros alike, gathered\
  \ nightly around the fire in campgrounds for the sole purpose of being close to\
  \ rocks.\nI suppose there is no greater an equalizer and connector than sleeping\
  \ on the same patch of dirt and sharing the same pit toilet with strangers. I might\
  \ have gone for the rocks, but I stayed for the people."
