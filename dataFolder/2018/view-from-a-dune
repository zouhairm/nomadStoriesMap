Text: "We were travelling from Paris to Spain in an old bottle-green Citroen Saxo.\
  \ The journey would have taken more than ten hours and we had already decided to\
  \ stop halfway, near the Atlantic Coast. Approaching our destination, we began to\
  \ see road signs that apparently indicated a dune: sometimes called \u201Cdu\u201D\
  \ or \u201Cde Pilat\u201D, sometimes just \u201CPila\u201D. As we still had three\
  \ hours of daylight, we decided to stop.\nThe road signs led us along a road lost\
  \ in a forest, where pines stood up on its sides hiding the sun, until we reached\
  \ a big parking almost empty. It was a weekly winter day, but the surroundings showed\
  \ signs of their summer habits: there were some nice areas to picnic and a group\
  \ of wooden houses selling souvenirs.\nWe followed an uphill sand path where we\
  \ could see how the forest changed: trees were smaller and the ground was drier,\
  \ the grass grew barely in spots. As we proceeded, the sand increased and the trunks\
  \ came out of it, with their roots covered. All of them were skinny and spare, and\
  \ they let distinguish the sand suddenly stood up in a wave-like mountain, of which\
  \ we couldn\u2019t define the height. The climbing was difficult, but it was worth\
  \ it: at the top, a breathtaking view was waiting for us. The sand went down softly,\
  \ in harmonious rounded shapes, reaching the sea where we could see a gulf that\
  \ we recognized as Arcachon Bay. A small inhabited island appeared from the water\
  \ just in front of us. The expanse of sand continued for kilometers, between the\
  \ sea and the endless forest with no signs of human life: it was definitely an amazing\
  \ landscape that I couldn\u2019t expect to see in Europe.\nWe decided to reach what\
  \ it seemed a higher top, but the sand didn\u2019t let us determinate the real distance,\
  \ and we walked for half an hour finding sand hills covering other sand hills. A\
  \ big moon was visible in the sky and the dune looked like a Martian landscape with\
  \ small canyons shaped by the wind.\nWe lost the point we wanted to reach so we\
  \ stopped where the dune went down almost vertically covering the forest: the skeletal\
  \ branches of the trees came deadly out of the sand. We finally understood that\
  \ the dune was moving landward, eating the forest.\nWe came back with a strange\
  \ feeling, leaving the sand back and breathing the fresh air of the pine forest.\
  \ We thought every trip should be like the dune: with no directions, unstoppable\
  \ and unexpected. We got back on the road, without knowing it would be the last\
  \ journey of our old bottle-green Saxo."
