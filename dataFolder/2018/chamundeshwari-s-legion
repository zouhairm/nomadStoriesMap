Text: "As winter slowly crept in towards the end of September, I decided to leave\
  \ Bangalore, the city I have called home for the past three years, for a weekend\
  \ trip to Mysore. As trips go, this one was a fairly easy one to make. I found myself\
  \ in Mysore with a singular, primary goal: climb the steps leading up to the Chamundeshwari\
  \ temple. \nAn important piece of information that I had managed to miss was provided\
  \ by my Uber driver: I would have to climb a thousand odd steps to get to the temple.\
  \ \nWhat started off as a definite goal soon turned into, 'well, lets see how it\
  \ goes' in my head. The fact that there was a well tarred road leading upto the\
  \ temple deterred my initial plan of climbing all the way up and I decided to just\
  \ climb around a hundred of them instead, take a few pictures and then an Uber to\
  \ the top of the hill. \nOff I went, with monkeys and a cow to welcome me at the\
  \ first step who were sprawled out and lost in their own sensibilities, and up the\
  \ first few steps. Time had seeped into the stones around me and their creases were\
  \ darker than the ones on my grandmother's hands. The first few steps in and the\
  \ world suddenly but surely felt isolated, like these were only building blocks\
  \ that mattered. \nMore monkeys appeared as I breathed in the quiet of the space\
  \ while managing to take pictures to my heart's content. I had lost count of how\
  \ many steps I had climbed so I decided to go up a little further and then a little\
  \ more. Soon I had climbed enough to have decided that I was going to get to the\
  \ top, on foot. It was too late to give up now. \nThe older couple leisurely walking\
  \ down past me, the younger one, trying to go unnoticed as they huddled in closer,\
  \ the numerous birds that I would never be able to differentiate between and the\
  \ monkeys that were so accustomed to humans that they simply sat and went about\
  \ their business - they were all motivation to keep climbing. \nAs the temple appeared\
  \ before me, standing tall in the distance, I realized that Chamundeshwari's city\
  \ had already consumed me, even before I had got to her. Her legions of devotees\
  \ and visitors, human and otherwise, had provided me with a journey already filled\
  \ with an otherworldly aura. Getting to her was the goal but the bond made with\
  \ the world around her felt like a distant home that I'd always known of but never\
  \ visited. \nEven as someone who identifies as a non religious individual, Chamundeshwari\
  \ had managed to capture the spirit of my soul within the steps leading to her."
