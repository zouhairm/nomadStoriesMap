Text: "My news feed was littered with chaos, consumption, and sadness.  Try as I might\
  \ to shift the focus to the positive, the algorithms of social media were winning.\
  \  They were suffocating my soul.  Irritated with life, I booked a ten day island\
  \ hop banking on Hawaii's sun and surf to be my salvation.  Almost as if the universe\
  \ were intent on punishing me for my lack of perspective, the forecast grew more\
  \ bleak by the day.  But I hadn't bought the travel insurance.  We were going. \
  \ \n\nThree days at a Maui yoga retreat would start our cleanse.  Beyond excited\
  \ for the ease of breath and communion with likeminded individuals, my newlywed\
  \ husband and I practically skipped through the door like schoolgirls after summer\
  \ break.  Unfortunately, we ran abrubtly into a Berlin wall of man-hating vibes,\
  \ sordid stories and the oft dreaded spiritual cliches.  After a couple days of\
  \ hiding out, narrowly escaping the storms of our fellow inmates, we ventured out\
  \ on the long and winding climb to Haleakala's famous vista.  I had seen yoga-wear\
  \ clad Instagram superstars posting pictures up here; it would be incredible!  Of\
  \ course we arrived to 20 ft visibility at the peak and a cloud filled crater. \
  \   \n\nOn Oahu we rose at 4:45am to hike Makapu'u Point for sunrise.  Armed with\
  \ stout dedication, undeterred by rockfalls, broken paths, newly installed razor\
  \ wire and chains strong enough to hold the gates of Hades, we made our way to the\
  \ cutest little off-limits lighthouse you've ever seen.  The navigational beacon\
  \ slowly pulled its light-fingers through pea soup clouds.  My spirits fell again.\
  \  Sipping cold coffee, I begged the dawn to burn them off.  It didn't.\n\nFinally\
  \ aboard our flight to the Big Island we looked at the forecast for Hilo; solid\
  \ rain as far as the app could see.  An hour later we stepped into the musty terminal,\
  \ questioning the wisdom of carpet in the islands, and watched the drizzle turn\
  \ to a downpour.  This had become pure comedy.  We were chasing storms and we had\
  \ forgotten our rain jackets.    \n\nI stepped out of the rental car at our final\
  \ destination and, as if on cue, the rains held their breath.  Before me lay the\
  \ perfect paradise: a lush jungle with peak-a-boo ocean views, sturdy repurposed\
  \ swings and a cerulean pool.  Awash in the tranquil mist I closed my eyes to the\
  \ coqui frog's sweet call, \"ko-Keee.  ko-Keee.\"  The past week faded gently. \
  \ Here, where every structure honored the past that created such an ethereal present,\
  \ peace finally prevailed."
