Text: "Nepali buses are never full. This is the mantra doormen seem to tell themselves\
  \ as each new passenger is pulled on, as if the words themselves could conjure room.\
  \ This space manifests in micro-shifts and the rearranging of cargo. This is true\
  \ in Pokhara and it\u2019s true in Kathmandu. It\u2019s also true 6000 feet high\
  \ on the Annapurna Circuit.\n\nOnce you hit Jomsom, the trail sours: dangerous roads,\
  \ leeches and landslides prevail. Most fly out, but I travel cheap. I took the bus.\n\
  \nThe hulk in question is one of these Indian hand-me-downs: body like a shipping\
  \ container, a hundred shades of chipped paint, wheels tilting like the axle\u2019\
  s superglue is wearing off. It\u2019s a Wes Anderson paradigm. The doorman, Krishna,\
  \ pulls me on and we\u2019re off.\n\nIt\u2019s packed with Himalayans, their sacks\
  \ of veggies and a five-track Bollywood CD blaring on tin speakers. There\u2019\
  s a man in the front cab, his leg in a splint. After two weeks of hiking my legs\
  \ feel how his looks, so I grab the only seat left; a sack of potatoes. The bus\
  \ starts jostling over the road* and I grip the top of the sack to stabilize myself.\
  \ It\u2019s more like riding a bull than sitting on a bus. \n\n*Road: A packed dirt\
  \ trail that narrows quickly on mountain cliffs. Alchemists will tell you water\
  \ plus earth equals mud, but the Nepali will add that mud plus height means landslides.\
  \ Three hours in, the first drops splatter the windshield. \n\nI\u2019ve a clear\
  \ view out the bus door, a view straight down a 1000 foot gorge as the bus\u2019\
  \ wheels start spinning through mud. The driver is gunning it uphill and Krishna\
  \ is hanging out the door yelling. The rain has started forming small creeks in\
  \ our tracks.\n\nWe\u2019re sliding up the mountain in centimeters. Krishna is pushing\
  \ the bus now and I\u2019m looking at the 10 centimeters between wheels and cliff\
  \ when a sunbeam breaks across the valley. It illumines a boarded-up town. \n\n\
  Roads have wrought a double-edged sword on the Circuit. Remote hamlets receive more\
  \ access to reliable energy, aid and medical support, yet the increased number of\
  \ cars and rutted tracks discourage nature-seeking hikers \u2014 the main economic\
  \ asset for these villages. Towns in the Kaligandaki valley have been hit particularly\
  \ hard as people fly over or bus through. \n \nAs we make it over the hill, the\
  \ rain stops. The bus quiets. The driver shuts off the music and only the cranking\
  \ gears infect the air. The splinted-man lowers his head like an actuary, counting\
  \ the measurements between life and something more uncertain."
