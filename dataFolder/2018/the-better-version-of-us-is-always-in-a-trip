Text: "Last spring I and my boyfriend arrived to Istanbul from different countries\
  \ to two different airports \u2013 Ataturk and Sabiha Gokcen. I didn\u2019t have\
  \ time for exchange money before flight and had 10 euro and my credit card. \nBut\
  \ when I arrived suddenly I realized that I\u2019ve lost my credit card!\nI decided\
  \ Ok, don\u2019t panic! My boyfriend has given me the bus number to the hotel, I\
  \ took a breath of amazing wet air of Istanbul and caught the bus. \nCity was so\
  \ unusual, so motley! In 5-7 minutes I had to be in a right place, but 15 minutes\
  \ left, 20 and 25 and it was still not my bus stop. I had been worrying of cause.\
  \ I was in a huge city without money, I didn\u2019t have my credit card, I didn\u2019\
  t have roaming, I didn\u2019t speak Turkish. \n\u201CCould you help me please?\u201D\
  \ I asked the Turkish guy in the bus. I showed that guy the hotel I needed and location\
  \ Taksim. \u201CI\u2019m sorry, I don\u2019t know this city so well, but as I see\
  \ you are going to the opposite direction\u201D. \nProbably that guy saw in my eyes\
  \ how nervous I was.\nHis name was Hassan, he was from Marocco. It was his couple\
  \ of days trip to Turkey and he was going for his business. But he delayed his plan\
  \ and we went out at the next bus station.\nWe walked a little, then we went by\
  \ subway, then changed the branch line and went again and the third line we choose\
  \ could bring me exactly to Taksim. All the way we talked about our countries \u2013\
  \ Kazakhstan and Morocco, it was very new information for both of us. He was so\
  \ nice and polite person, I thanked God I asked exactly him for help. And what was\
  \ very nice too \u2013 he paid for our tickets himself every time albeit I didn\u2019\
  t ask for that.\n\u201CHere I leave you, in some minutes you could find your place\
  \ there, I should be in hurry\u201D, Hassan said. I wanted to give him my business\
  \ card, I opened my bag and saw two mandarins and got laughed. \u201CWhat?\u201D\
  \ he asked. I answered: \u201CLook! I\u2019ve brought Morocco mandarins from Kazakhstan\u201D\
  . He recognized mandarins from his country. It was really funny.\nAs I got known\
  \ later my boyfriend mixed up information about airports and bus numbers \u2013\
  \ so my bus was for him from Ataturk airport and his number was for me from Sabiha\
  \ Gokcen. But as Russians say \u201CIt wouldn\u2019t be happiness but misfortune\
  \ helped\u201D. I was happy to meet that nice guy and I hope once I could go to\
  \ Morocco and meet Hassan again. I know a little about this country, but what I\
  \ know exactly is there are excellent kind people there. And this is the best way\
  \ of knowing new countries \u2013 by connecting with people."
