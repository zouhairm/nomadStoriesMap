Text: "In March 2017, I headed to Cuba with two girlfriends. Just prior, many restrictions\
  \ for Americans to travel to the Caribbean island had been released and the three\
  \ of us were beyond stoked to see miles of tobacco plants in Vi\xF1ales Valley,\
  \ the brightly colored homes in Trinidad, and classic cars lining Havana\u2019s\
  \ streets. \nWe obtained a people-people visa and set up different events in Cuba.\
  \ One of these was a dinner with a local Cuban family. Just prior other friends\
  \ had traveled to Cuba and met a family which was the highlight of their trip. The\
  \ three of us contacted the family and weren\u2019t sure what to expect when the\
  \ taxi dropped us off in front of their home. However, any fear or uncertainty we\
  \ had quickly dissipated as a young 19 year-old boy, Randy, and 12 yr-old sister\
  \ waved from a window. \nTheir parents excitedly ushered us in and spoke to us in\
  \ broken English as we offered back our best broken Spanish. As a University student,\
  \ Randy studied English and could speak fluently. After socializing in the family\u2019\
  s living-room for some time, dinner was ready and we sat at the table. Randy excitedly\
  \ explained to us that because Cuba is a communist country, everything is regulated\
  \ by the government- even the food. We happened to be there during the month of\
  \ the potato (for only one month of the year can they eat potatoes) and Randy was\
  \ beyond excited as he explained potatoes are his favorite.\nThe food was some of\
  \ the best I\u2019ve ever tasted- ever. The beans were seasoned to perfection and\
  \ the potatoes were delectable. Randy piled his plate HIGH with potatoes and his\
  \ mother knocked his elbow in disapproval. As we ate and chatted, I asked Randy\
  \ if he ever thought of leaving Cuba. Randy chuckled and began a short discourse\
  \ on the hardships which come with a communist country and dreams for the future.\
  \ \nThrough this dinner, I noted that while in completely different situations,\
  \ we\u2019re all the same. We have frustrations with our governments, with our leaders\
  \ and certain policies. We imagine lives where we can pursue dreams, be who we want\
  \ to be and go anywhere. We fantasize about safe communities and neighborhoods where\
  \ everyone knows they belong- that we don\u2019t need to fit a certain mold or look\
  \ a certain way to be accepted. The connection the three of us made with Randy and\
  \ his family that day will be one that I always cherish. Randy reminded me that\
  \ as breathing human beings, we have more similarities than we have differences\
  \ as a Cuban and American."
