Text: "\u201CYou are too late. They are gone,\u201D grumbles\_our guide in\_a deep\
  \ matter-of-fact tone, pointing his walking stick at a scattering of footprints\
  \ that have indented the dry soil. Barobi, a senior man from a local village, epitomises\
  \ the essence of a Motswana. Although a friendly character, he is somewhat careless\
  \ in his approach, leading our sunrise bush walk at a rushed pace and blaming us\
  \ for the wild animals\u2019 absence. His wrinkled face and dark deep-set eyes speak\
  \ many tales I wish he\u2019d tell; each notch in his skin suggesting a strenuous\
  \ day in the African sun, a lifetime of providing, a part of Botswana\u2019s fight\
  \ for independence.\nAmbling deeper, our heavy steps crunch through the tinder-dry\
  \ grass where bushfires have recently scorched the ground. Unwillingly I sense myself\
  \ become pessimistic as a doubtful veil casts over my faith in seeing the Okavango\
  \ Delta\u2019s wildlife.\nOnce again, our apathetic leader draws to a halt. \u201C\
  Over there...\u201D he lazily nods towards the horizon, \u201Cyou see?\u201D Lifting\
  \ our heads, we squint into the distance. Those with the best eyesight react first,\
  \ our expressions becoming brighter as one by one we identify the vast number of\
  \ darkened creatures that emerge from a sea of shadows.\nCreeping ever closer, we\
  \ gradually face a scribbled line of blue wildebeest. After a catastrophic loss\
  \ to the population less than a decade ago, these Brindled Gnus are an unusual sight\
  \ in the Botswana bush, making this an event experienced by few others. Barobi encourages\
  \ us to walk on but a trickle of hesitation seeps into my mind. Little more than\
  \ a bare, burnt plain lays between us and these wild beings.\nAn eerie atmosphere\
  \ sweeps over the great plateau. Hundreds of dishevelled manes turn in unison as\
  \ their glassy black eyes cast distrust upon us. Two tribes, humans and beasts,\
  \ silently stare at each other, analysing the danger that each might pose. We stand\
  \ transfixed, sharing a flicker of nervous appreciation for this surreal meeting\
  \ before a light-hearted note of musical birdsong fractures the stillness.\nAll\
  \ at once, movement begins to snake its way through the herd. Motionless creatures\
  \ blend into a stampede of ungainly runners as a moment once so intensely\_quiet\_\
  morphs into a thunderous roar. Our bodies tremble. The wildebeest now wary of our\
  \ human stance begin their escape for safety, an army of hooves smashing into the\
  \ ground. All that remains are the dents among the dust, evidence of wildlife that\
  \ will no doubt offer hope on Barobi\u2019s next expedition."
