Text: "Diogenes walked down the road towards the shore. it was about midnight, and\
  \ he was roaming hither and thither. The air held the cold of winter, and the sea\
  \ waves seemed interminable and haunted by ghosts and unobserved spells. He sat\
  \ under a formidable amount of big rocks as a huge chunks of angelic seashells littered\
  \ all over the shore. The only noise was the cracking water-wheel on the other side\
  \ of the shore and the jingling waves. Unexpectedly a rapturous voice broke the\
  \ night. He was a fisherman with a harpoon and a trawl on his left shoulder. One\
  \ foot in the grave and old as the hills.He was muffled inside a heavy Green coat,\
  \ moving and Bending forward to keep his balance. Diogenes said:  \" I can see that\
  \ your harpoon is undefeated and you are unbeaten as far as a traveler can tell.\"\
  In a cheerful voice the fisherman replied : We cannot avoid old age because it is\
  \ the most incredible journey towards foresight and sapience. we can only meet it\
  \ with open arms.\u201D There was a flood of thoughts circling in the shepherd's\
  \ mind as the strong breeze carried him backward. Diogenes lowered his voice and\
  \ said : \u201Cit's not the age of the body but that of the mind that matters. The\
  \ change is inevitable like the turquoise waves and the rising tide.\" The Fisherman\
  \ seemed to be undefeated like a good chess-player who knows how to exploit every\
  \ move and turn every small advantage into a greater one. The Fisherman replied\
  \ in an overpowered voice that urged Diogenes to listen: \u201CAge can be a prison\
  \ or a prison without bars and who holds the key will unchain his chains and liberate\
  \ his soul. Those who advance with an unflinching determination and decisiveness\
  \ are the real philosophers and poets, they are earthly prophets and eternal gods.\
  \ They are the nomads and earth lanterns.\" The rain started to clatter down in\
  \ huge drops.There was thunder and everything around looked eerie and menacing.\
  \ While a sudden gust of wind sent an avalanshe of rain across the Fisherman\u2019\
  s wrinkled cheeks that looked like Nazca lines. He nodded his head and added: \u201C\
  I feel like a red dot, a Grammar mistake in the text of the world.\u201D Diogenes\
  \ added:  \"You can call me the fervent traveler, I have always felt that I belong\
  \ to the desert, a whirling desert inside my soul. The dunes of the desert and the\
  \ state of timelessness urges me to go ahead and find a way for a change, like a\
  \ vagabond, a cloud, a host of gathered stars. I was born to ramble and rove till\
  \ silence spreads and the towns are sleep.\u201D"
