Text: "The day began with me lugging my suitcase back to my bedsit in the pouring\
  \ rain at 2:00am. I was in my first month at the University of Limerick at the time\
  \ and just returning from a 5-day workshop in Brussels, a little worse for wear.\
  \ After going through a period of depression a few years ago, I was in two minds\
  \ about whether to seize the opportunity to follow an Erasmus programme. UL wasn\u2019\
  t my first choice either, but one major pro was IntSoc, as it was fondly referred\
  \ to by its members, a student group that organised fortnightly trips around Ireland.Only\
  \ just making it to campus some 4 hours later, I made my way onto the crowded coach\
  \ bound for the national park of Killarney. From what I had seen of Ireland so far,\
  \ I had come to realise that its breath-taking scenery undoubtedly makes it one\
  \ of the most underrated countries in the world. This park, however, looked like\
  \ something straight out of a movie scene; woodland that stretched out for miles,\
  \ void of any other human beings other than our little group. The nature trail led\
  \ us to a massive lake surrounded by a background of furry green hilltops and, to\
  \ complete the harmonious setting, a lone deer quietly grazing. Trying to put its\
  \ subdued beauty into words really doesn\u2019t do it justice. At that moment, I\
  \ knew it was worth the lack of sleep. The opposite side of the park was equally\
  \ spectacular. Picture a forest that could have been handpicked out of a child\u2019\
  s book of fairy tales, leading to the centrepiece - a stunning waterfall, nestled\
  \ between the trees, like we were stumbling upon some mystical secret. The aura\
  \ of the place was so enchanting that the cold didn\u2019t even bother me anymore.\
  \ Everything else melted away in awe of all that hit my senses. We rounded off the\
  \ day by going for dinner in a charming little pub, packed with locals, in the nearby\
  \ town. By the end of the day, I had made the acquaintance of 2 Americans, a Canadian\
  \ and a French girl. The coach ride back to Limerick was equally entertaining. IntSoc\
  \ had a long-standing tradition of one of getting everyone to sing along to Irish\
  \ tunes, in a fun attempt to keep everyone\u2019s spirits up on the long journey\
  \ home. Maybe I was still buzzed from the thermos full of coffee I had brought along,\
  \ but ultimately, it felt good, knowing that miles away from family, friends and\
  \ familiarity, sleep deprived and indescribably cold, I had thoroughly enjoyed myself.\
  \ That day had been like a sign that past demons wouldn\u2019t hold me back any\
  \ longer, if I didn\u2019t let them."
