Text: "Never having ridden a motorcycle before, it seemed like a thrilling fantasy\
  \ to rent one for a day. I could never have predicted the horrid yet heartening\
  \ events I was to face, as I almost lost my life before witnessing the humility\
  \ of unknown people in Vietnam.\n\nRenting bikes did not require a license in Da\
  \ Lat. At 9am, I stormed down the stairs and sped outside. My smirk radiating confidence\
  \ out of having no idea what's to come. Lyn received me with a smile. But when I\
  \ said, \u201CI've never ridden before\u201D it turned into trauma. So a brief tutorial\
  \ began. Starting up switching gears, we went onto inclined streets. No control\
  \ for me, anxiety for her. Our bumps, sharp turns, and ascents, we finished in 20\
  \ minutes.\n\u201CIt's a bad idea entrusting you this scooter\u201D.\n\u201CI can't\
  \ argue\u201D.\nThe day began. Sunlight glistened on the empty street. I was glad\
  \ the helmet had no front glass, as the chilled lake breeze made the forehead sweat\
  \ disappear. I'd halt to check navigation, struggle with acceleration at sharp turns,\
  \ get ankle jerks trying to brake with my feet. The rains began to pour down mercilessly\
  \ next. A slippery highway with drops bombarding my eyes, turned out a disaster.\
  \ A gulp of uncertainty passed as I began to wonder if this was another bad decision.\
  \ I eventually stopped by closed shops, where a stranger helped me drag my scooter\
  \ under a roof. A disappointed me was comforted as he stood there and shared his\
  \ patience.\nAfter a while, I was able to cover glorious Pagodas, waterfalls, museums.\
  \ I stood by Buddha statues, incense odour, and calm monks, as the vibe tried to\
  \ comfort me. However, my mind was on the fence between the thrill of the scooter\
  \ ride, and the the potential risk I had taken over-confidently.\nRiding back on\
  \ a national highway now, eyes steady on the road, the mirror reflected a truck\
  \ moving with fierce momentum. In a split second, as a turn was coming up I skid\
  \ and slipped over to the side of the road. Almost. The heavy scooter on my leg\
  \ as I fell, I spazzed just in time to avoid being run over by the truck. A candid\
  \ Bollywood moment.\nTowards the end of the day, riding back to town, I did manage\
  \ to gain some control. Too soon to learn but there was not much anxiety anymore.\
  \ Perhaps I had accepted the need for a risky leap to achieve the brilliant experience\
  \ riding."
