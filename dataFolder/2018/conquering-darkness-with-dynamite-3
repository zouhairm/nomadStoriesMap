Text: "Into the darkness of the hole we descended. Down a rickety wooden ladder balanced\
  \ delicately on the earthen wall. Technicoloured mineral rocks rose in a mountainous\
  \ pile above the entry into the mines. \n\nDreadful memories of whimpering entrapment\
  \ plagued me from my days of hopeless depression... I'd travelled to Latin America\
  \ alone to seek a deeper purpose of living. \n\nThe air below the surface was suffocating\
  \ - more so as the city of Potosi in the southern Bolivian plateaus is situated\
  \ at an altitude of 4,000 metres above sea level. Dust swam in the brightness of\
  \ the beams shone from our head-torches. We found a shaft to our right and tracks\
  \ below our feet, surprised that we could stand upright at 160 metres underneath\
  \ the ground.\n \nCrisscrossing corners, we stumbled upon the God of the Underworld.\
  \ Shaped like a ram sprouting horns and wearing a garland of long confetti as a\
  \ scarf, the El Tio watches over the mines and protects its workers. Our guide Michael,\
  \ an ex-miner himself, poured a carton of 96% alcohol around the statue, lit a cigarette\
  \ and stuck it onto the 'O' of El Tio's mouth as a sign of worship. Cans of beers\
  \ sat at his feet as the miners attempt to please their almighty deity.   \n\n\"\
  They call him El Tio instead of 'El Dio' ('The God') in Spanish because the Natives\
  \ could not pronounce 'Dio'\u2026\", he chuckled. Silver discovered in the Cerro\
  \ Rico ('Rich Hill') by the Spanish in the 16th century prospered Potosi into the\
  \ wealthiest city in the world\u2026 until the silver ran out. Miraculously, it\
  \ is still a working mine after 500 years.\n\nThe earthen walls seem to close on\
  \ us as we crawled on all fours up to the enclave above. Gathering courage and hoisting\
  \ ourselves upwards, we found Ivan, clad in blue garments and bent hard at work\
  \ although it was a public holiday. Ivan is a senior miner; short of a mine owner\
  \ but having more rights than the younger workers transporting rocks in the three-tier\
  \ cooperative mining system. \n\n\"I work an average of 8 hours a day, up to 18\
  \ hours if the yields are high. At other times, I have businesses in Santa Cruz\
  \ de la Tierra,\" he said rather cheerfully, sucking on coca leaves rolled in a\
  \ ball on the left side of his mouth. \n\nThe power of perseverance and an uncanny\
  \ knack for survival was exactly the inspiration I needed to fight the illness that\
  \ has affected me since adolescence.  \n\nBefore we left, I gifted Ivan a roll of\
  \ dynamite I'd bought from the Miner's Market. Ivan's grin of gratitude echoed my\
  \ sentiments."
