Text: "Pa... pa, pa\u2026 pa-pa. The clave is in my step as I climb the stairs of\
  \ 125th Station. The bright September summer blinds me, and when I open my eyes,\
  \ I\u2019m in East Harlem. Wide-eyed young student, I came here not knowing much,\
  \ but knowing enough to come from the other side of the world. On this languid afternoon,\
  \ the streets are shockingly ordinary. I\u2019m at ease, my brown skin is a good\
  \ disguise. After all, curry and salsa both refer to spices. With gawky, preconceived\
  \ ideas in my mind, I turn towards Marcus Garvey Park. I pass red brick low-rise\
  \ buildings that have just the right amount of grain. The cracked wrinkles in the\
  \ concrete form root-like patterns : as if these streets, seeped in afro-cuban rhythms,\
  \ could tell the story of mambo. \n\nI enter the park from Madison Avenue, boulder\
  \ blanketed by the green shadow of the tall trees. I\u2019m lost, so I ask the only\
  \ passerby for directions. He laughs a little as he looks me up and down. I am clearly\
  \ out of place. Finally, I sit down in an amphitheater, a bit anxious. It looks\
  \ like a zoo amphitheater before a parrot show. I am not sure it was worth coming\
  \ anymore. But I might as well stay. \n\nHours later, my heart is ablaze as I walk\
  \ back towards the subway. I revel in the the night, my heartbeat drumming like\
  \ timbales. I never expected what just happened, I will remember this evening, siempre\u2026\
  \ I relive it over and over. I remember, almost as if it were a dream, laughing\
  \ and dancing, being plunged into the heart of El Barrio. The audience, Puerto Ricans,\
  \ Cubans, Mexicans and other countries the MC did not call, roared with joy and\
  \ pride - and I along with them - as the MC joked about Latinas being late. \n\n\
  Suddenly, a beautiful woman MC came out on stage, sporting her Latina sass and curves.\
  \ She announced a name and the crowd went wild. \n\n\u201CTito Puente Juniorrr!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI know this name! I thought to myself. Impossible! The stage filled with musiciens\
  \ and the crowd, young and old, got to their feet as Tito Puente Jr. sauntered on\
  \ stage, suave. He talked, like a father to his people. He was there for his people.\
  \ Just like his father, he came to play for free, to keep the legacy and the history\
  \ alive, effortlessly regaling us with stories about the barrio. The birthplace\
  \ of latin jazz, suddenly this commercial sentence gained meaning. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe how lucky I was to be there. Then, the band began an animated rendition\
  \ of Oye Como Va and the flute, eerie and earthy all at once lifted me to my feet.\
  \ And we danced."
