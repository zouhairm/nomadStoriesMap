Text: "I woke up in a grey office cubicle on a rainy October day sometime in 2013\
  \ in an a-ha moment realizing that my life was going to pass by if I didn't stop\
  \ waiting for a perfect time to travel or for friends to stop being broke, or for\
  \ a perfect partner to come along and travel with me. It is there and then, I decided\
  \ to become a solo traveler. A solo. female. traveler. \nA week later I was on a\
  \ plane to the Big island of Hawaii. I was psyched about the whole idea of me, a\
  \ shy girl from a small Belorussian village settling down half a world away from\
  \ home in the US and becoming a world traveler. It gave me tons of energy. \nOn\
  \ my last leg from LA to Kona, I sat next to a couple of yogis. The free spirits\
  \ were living off their backpacks and planned on staying in a hostel on Kona coffee\
  \ plantation. All they had was a post card with its name and no address. I was mesmerized\
  \ by their care free life approach and couldn\u2019t help but offer them a ride\
  \ in my rental, although it would add two hours to my trip to the yoga retreat I\
  \ was headed to. We ended up in the middle of plantation after midnight with cameras\
  \ pointed at us and surrounded with \"NO Trespassing\" signs. There was no sign\
  \ of a hostel. I laughed at the idea of getting arrested after 18 hours of traveling\
  \ on a coffee plantation for trespassing. How pathetic would that be? I dropped\
  \ off my new friends at the nearest hostel down the road and drove off.\nNext morning,\
  \ I woke up in a room with a net instead of glass windows to the sound of the ocean,\
  \ rain drops falling with a juicy splash into the leaves of coconut palms, and a\
  \ chorus of birds celebrating the sunrise. I was in paradise and no longer tired.\n\
  In one week I circled the island twice. I saw the throat of an active volcano, looked\
  \ down on the sunset from one of the world tallest mountains, swam with manta rays,\
  \ snorkeled in hidden tidal pools bustling with coral reef life, dipped my feet\
  \ into the olive sands of the rarest Green Sand beach, and sunbathed naked on the\
  \ Black Sand beach. I could never expect from myself to be able to take off the\
  \ bathing suit and swim in the Pacific Ocean naked...what a liberating experience\
  \ it was!\nIn one week my life turned upside down and never changed back. I travel\
  \ often, I dive deep into the culture of each country, and I am no longer shy to\
  \ meet new people and being a solo traveler. Life is a journey that is meant to\
  \ be lived and filled with memories and experiences. All you need to do is open\
  \ yourself to opportunities!"
