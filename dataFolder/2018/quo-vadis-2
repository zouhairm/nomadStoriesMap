Text: "The American dream! Is it bitter or sweet? On a cold day of January, 2014,\
  \ I boarded on an Italian airbus and flied over the cold and deep waters of the\
  \ Atlantic ocean in order to reach Buffalo. Buffalo is a small American city in\
  \ the state of New York, very close to the American-Canadian border. The city was\
  \ founded by European-Americans in 1789; however, its first inhabitants are assumed\
  \ to be the nomadic Paleo-Indians (7000 B.C.). Buffalo experienced significant economic\
  \ growth during the first industrial revolution. However, in the years that followed,\
  \ the nationwide trend for deindustrialization brought the city to knees. Nowadays,\
  \ Buffalo is a famous destination for nature lovers and aspiring academics.\n\n\
  Quo vadis? The purpose of my visit to Buffalo was purely professional. I was supposed\
  \ to spend a semester at a prestigious academic institution in order to improve\
  \ my skills in engineering. But how would I achieve my goal? By attending courses\
  \ offered by international experts in field and by spending long hours in the library.\
  \ Soon I started to feel the unbearable weight of my monotonous routine. I developed\
  \ a profound desire for sunbathing and I wanted my sneakers back; it had been already\
  \ two months I was wearing this pair of black snow boots to walk back and forth\
  \ to the campus. Within a few weeks, I had become nostalgic of my previous unconfined\
  \ reality. I had missed the warmth of my beloved Sicily, its daily confusion and\
  \ its lovely people. I had set for a place that was not my Ithaca and this place\
  \ had fooled me. I was too young at the time to be patient and to understand how\
  \ my sad American experience could be part of a bigger plan.\n\nOedipus Rex. Oedipus\
  \ Rex is a masterpiece of the ancient Greek tragedy. Sophocles created a king who\
  \ was not born to rule, but was born to fulfill a prophecy. Oedipus killed his father,\
  \ Laius, and married his mother, Jocasta, before blinding himself in despair. Freud\
  \ was particularly touched by Oedipus\u2019 story since his tragic destiny could\
  \ had been ours. The ancient Greeks knew it from the very beginning; our fate is\
  \ sealed upon our birth. \n\nInterpretation of dreams. I have many dreams. During\
  \ the day, during the night. For example, I want to write a book. I want to travel.\
  \ I want to understand the simple things and the complicated ones. I want to learn\
  \ to appreciate the good and the bad moments. I dream because I\u2019m curious about\
  \ my future. I would like to discover my destiny."
