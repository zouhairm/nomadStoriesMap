Text: "This is the last part of my climb on kilimanjaro.\n\nI remember an infinite\
  \ time, trapped by an empty mind. The thoughts that night struggled to come out,\
  \ pushed with exhaustion and came out defeated. Because up there, every single part\
  \ of my head conformed to the temperature and every single effort focused on my\
  \ body. \nThat night my body and I questioned each other. A part of it gave up several\
  \ times, another push of the will ignored the tears and kept on walking. My body\
  \ and I stopped up for down every minute, about for another minute yet. My body\
  \ and I listened and quarreled as perhaps it never happened.\nMy body and I pulled\
  \ the first 2 hours straight, we thought about going back the next hour, and giving\
  \ up even in the last 45 minutes. It was hard because I went against the will of\
  \ my body. He was screaming, quivering, suffering, and I did not listen to him.\n\
  I did not listen to him when he exposed me the problem, I ignored him when he asked\
  \ me to follow him, I did not notice when he stopped loving me. Love for myself\
  \ darkened his presence, as he did with my body. \nOn the door, when he was ready\
  \ to go, I turned, and awareness took hold of reality. At the exact moment when\
  \ I realized the principle of freezing that was taking place, I began to fear for\
  \ my life, for our history. The unconsciousness lost her on that mountain, virginity\
  \ in step with the fear of losing him. My body.\nHe reacted, and I decided to react\
  \ too. Run after him, as I always do on finishing things. I chase him not to let\
  \ him die. To not let us die.\nNumbness, freezing.\nI began not to see each other\
  \ better, misty and whitish. Joseph took my gloves off, reached my hands in prayer\
  \ and put them in his mouth, down to his throat. He blew hard, until exhaustion.\
  \ They said I began to pick up color, my cheeks burned with a warm rose. I began\
  \ to feel pain in my hands and knees. Feeling the pains in that case was synonymous\
  \ with recovery, life, just like in life.\n10 minutes, now 5. We looked up. For\
  \ once no boulder in front of us, no infinite expanse, if not that of heaven.\n\
  After 4 days we could see the end. Those 5 minutes were finally apparent, real,\
  \ existing.\nThe last kilometer of Africa's roof traveled in the 5 hours longer\
  \ than my life. I pursued my soul on that ground, grabbed it from life and decided\
  \ to fill it like this. He hid several times between uncertainties and errors, but\
  \ recognizing it was the simplest of games. His hallmark never lost it: was the\
  \ unconscious one."
