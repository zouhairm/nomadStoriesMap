Text: "A mototaxi with no passengers leaves the air filled with sand and dust. I squeeze\
  \ my bag against my chest while entire families keep walking as one man. A mototaxi\
  \ bumping down the hill, like Moses crossing a red sea of bodies, does not seem\
  \ to worry anyone but me. We are walking up the cerro that here looks like gruy\xE8\
  re cheese under a blanket of bright crosses signaling each hole. The sandy hills\
  \ on the edges of the city reveal what Lima actually is: a desert by the Pacific\
  \ coast. However, these cerros in Villa Mar\xEDa del Triunfo district are like no\
  \ others. Everywhere you look, you see graves.\n\nPeruvians inhabit a world of superlatives.\
  \ They cook the best ceviche, some say the Inca people were three meters tall, and\
  \ Peru owns the broadest variety of papas: 5,000 types. Nueva Esperanza cemetery\
  \ is the largest in South America, a man with a brush in his right hand and a can\
  \ in his left one explains me. Nueva Esperanza means New Hope and he is hoping for\
  \ a new client to come and hire his services. November 1 is a good day for business.\
  \ He is almost finished painting in light yellow a wooden cross with no name while\
  \ a woman in a red tight t-shirt unfolds her arms and gives directions a few steps\
  \ away.\n\nIt is the first time I celebrate All Saints Day since I was old enough\
  \ to skip family gatherings. In the town where my mom grew up, bones lay behind\
  \ granite instead of underground, like a beehive made of stone. I still wonder what\
  \ my grandad thought about me not attending his funeral. Since he passed, I look\
  \ for answers in the graveyard of my childhood memories, where my grand-aunts wore\
  \ long grey skirts, carried discreet bouquets of carnations, and talked in whispers.\n\
  \nNueva Esperanza instead is hectic the way a market is on a sales day: you can\
  \ buy pairs of socks for three soles at the entrance, women cook arroz con pollo\
  \ in restaurant-size pots, and kids play hide-and-seek. Just some graves away from\
  \ the freshly painted cross, a man my age calls two guitars and one trumpet walking\
  \ up the cerro. The band honors the dead while the living sing the chorus and pass\
  \ a green glass bottle. In Nueva Esperanza, the young man later says: \u201Cwe celebrate\
  \ the dead doing what they liked best, and this conchasumadre loved cumbia and beer\
  \ as much as his own mother.\u201D My grandad was more of a wine person, I remember,\
  \ and the first true adventurer I ever met. I paid the cost of being thousands of\
  \ miles from my loved ones but I know he would be proud I have made it this far."
