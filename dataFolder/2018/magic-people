Text: "It was Magic. Almost 10 years ago, \nWe were flying , and all we knew was that\
  \ we wanted to let things happen.\nOur plane was arriving to Fez at 10pm and all\
  \ what we had was a backpack, and ticket back in 10 days from Marrakesh. \n\nWe\
  \ arrived to the airport in Fez, and made our way to the city with a couple that\
  \ was driving in that direction.\nRight where they left us, we found an only 5 rooms\
  \ Riad, own by an lovely couple, where we decided to stay for the night.\nWe woke\
  \ up to a beautiful surprise. Farah (one of the owners) led us to the roof terrace,\
  \ where he had a magnificent breakfast and tea already waiting for us. The honey\
  \ was delicious! and they were adorable. \nWe chatted with them while enjoying the\
  \ food altogether, and they recommended to us a couple of places to visit in town\
  \ (and also gave us some fresh mint, to smell while visiting the area where they\
  \ manipulate the leather, as it can get pretty smelly). \nIt was then when we shared\
  \ with them our only plan for the trip:getting to Marrakesh in 9 days.\nWe spend\
  \ the day walking around Fez, and before going to bed, we said goodbye to Farah\
  \ and Badi, as they were not going to be there the next morning.\n\nWe woke up ready\
  \ for our adventure and found right outside the room a note that said: Call him\
  \ from the reception phone, and make your way to Rissani, you wont regret it!. The\
  \ note had a name, Hassan, and a phone number on it.\nHassan answer the phone, and\
  \ just listening his voice made us feel comfortable. \nHe said that he had a place\
  \ where we could stay in Rissani, and that if we wanted to rent a car, we could\
  \ make our way there for the evening. \nWe drove the whole day through beautiful\
  \ landscapes that were changing from busy roads leaving Fez, to forests, fields\
  \ full of crows, little towns and the magnificent Atlas mountains.\nWe got to Fez\
  \ when it was already dark, and Hassan was waiting for us right at the entrance\
  \ of the village.\nWe followed his car and got to a beautiful little riad where\
  \ we met Hassan's brothers, drank some mint tea and chatted for hours.\nWe woke\
  \ up to a beautiful desert.\nHassan treated us since the very beginning like if\
  \ we were family. He was good friends with Farah and Bady, and as he said: \"a friend\
  \ of them is a friend of mine\".\nWith him we visited the desert, Bereberer communities,\
  \ and he spent 3 days with us driving all the way to Marrakesh,  stopping by in\
  \ beautiful villages and landmarks.\nMeeting them made our trip."
