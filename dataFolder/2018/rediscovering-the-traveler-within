Text: "The last thing I expected to do was travel to Southern France. I was busy raising\
  \ two young daughters, caring for an ill father at home, preparing for a move across\
  \ the country and growing a business.  Life felt hectic and full. Why did this dream\
  \ of going to the South of France have to take center stage in my mind right now?\
  \ It was a thought that would not leave me alone. It seeped into my dreams and wiggled\
  \ its way into everyday conversations. After three months of trying my best to brush\
  \ it aside, I knew I had to listen and I booked my trip.\n\nAs I found myself staring\
  \ out the airplane window over the icy realm of Greenland, I wondered if I had made\
  \ the right decision.  We were days away from closing on a new house, I had never\
  \ been this far away from my children before and I honestly had never felt my heart\
  \ beat this fast in my chest.\n\nBreathing deep and closing my eyes for a moment\
  \ I realized this was an adventure into the unknown. I had traveled in my 20\u2019\
  s alone but I had not exercised this liberty since becoming \u201CMama.\u201D It\
  \ was as if I had to dive deep into the depths of this new experience, much like\
  \ the vastness outside of my window, to reclaim the pieces of myself that I had\
  \ buried and forgotten about. The carefree, travel-seeking, adventurous woman I\
  \ had been before babies, bottles and diapers was still here beneath the surface.\
  \ \n\nI sat on the airplane transfixed by the miles and miles of snowy mountains\
  \ below and the adventure that lie ahead and within. Little had I known when I booked\
  \ my ticket to France that I would be unearthing lost pieces of myself that I had\
  \ forgotten to pack in my suitcase of life. \n\nAs the plane touched down at the\
  \ Marseille Provence Airport and I fumbled my way at the bus ticket counter to purchase\
  \ a ticket to Aix-en-Provence, I knew I couldn\u2019t go back now. I was here, I\
  \ was alone and I was ready to awaken the neglected traveler within."
