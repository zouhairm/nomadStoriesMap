Text: "I'm a versatile writer contributing a wide-ranging variety of travel articles\
  \ to newspapers, magazines and websites; scroll to the bottom of the page for a\
  \ full list. These may be straightforward destination pieces, food and restaurant\
  \ reviews, light-hearted and informative round-ups or more evocative personal narratives.\n\
  \u200B\nLiterature, museums, architecture and history are often recurring themes\
  \ in my culture-based stories. I'll give just about any activity a go, but I'm particularly\
  \ happy when writing about hiking  and skiing. I first strapped on a pair of skis\
  \ in the Swiss Alps at the age of two, and haven't stopped (or even broken a bone)\
  \ since. I'm also something of an expert on river, expedition and luxury cruising.\
  \ For more, click on the CRUISE WRITING tab on the menu above.\n\uFEFF\nThe destinations\
  \ with which I'm most familiar? \u200BAs a 20-year resident of Sydney, I know Australia\
  \ well, and make frequent domestic trips. I spent another 20 years living in Switzerland,\
  \ speak fluent French, and return to Switzerland and other European destinations\
  \ at least twice a year.\u200B And lastly, I also lived in Chengdu in China  for\
  \ three years and return to China regularly.\u200B I'm a committed sinophile, wish\
  \ I spoke better Mandarin, but draw the line at eating chicken's feet in dim-sum\
  \ restaurants.\n\u200B\nIncidentally, I don't just confine myself to travel writing.\
  \ I also write other feature\narticles on a wide variety of topics, including health\
  \ and wellbeing, history, culture and food"
