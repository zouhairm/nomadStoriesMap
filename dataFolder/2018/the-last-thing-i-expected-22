Text: "\"It did not look enormous from the bottom though!\" I complained almost tearfully\
  \ to R., whisking sweat away from my temples, which became wet in the next few seconds.\
  \ It really is time to manage my expectations: every hiking, I note to myself \"\
  this one will take 40 minutes.\" Harum scarum. For the fourth hour, the August sun\
  \ mobilizing the rest of its forces had been stonily incinerating us.\n\"Shall I\
  \ get the water from my backpack?\" My companion inquired irreproachably-obligingly,\
  \ without, it seemed, paying attention to merciless Altaic heat.\nOn this trip,\
  \ we found our way at the very depths of the Altai Mountains. Such at depths that\
  \ the unspoilt purity of the local lakes made it possible to witness their bottom.\
  \ Such skyward that even in August, snow-covered caps of peaks rose. Such far that\
  \ indigenous Altaians, no longer diluted by foreigners, grinned hostilely witnessing\
  \ a stranger. That is because of shamanism according to which any living being,\
  \ be it a bush, an insect or an animal, had a soul. Therefore, they treated nature\
  \ utterly deferently (that is not anticipated from a Westerner perceived beforehand\
  \ as a barbarian). \nVis-a-vis the mountain we climbed, was another one covered\
  \ with a dense green forest. I had never saw before such a green color! The sun,\
  \ in its turn, enlivening greenery, covered it with the ethereal flickering cloth.\
  \ Thousands of hectares of this green and golden rampancy, bordered at the bottom\
  \ by a wide mountain river, forced to believe in the impeccable perfection of this\
  \ world.\nWhen R. and I finally reached the top falling exhausted to the ground,\
  \ I greedily glared at this omnipresent greenery and at a bizarre tracery of the\
  \ houses at the foot. Then suddenly my head was turned to take a picture of R. in\
  \ my memory. I definitely knew I would not see him again. I definitely knew he was\
  \ scarily able to live another few months: the last thing I expected to hear at\
  \ the beginning of our last meeting was the news of his incurable illness. Did he\
  \ know that he was everything to me from the moment of our acquaintance three years\
  \ ago? You know, the greatest power rests in weakness. However, I was not so strong\
  \ for loosening confession.\nIf somewhen my memories return me to this place, I\
  \ will manically describe you each engraved detail of his simple and infinitely\
  \ kind smile going hand in hand with immaculate strength of the Altai Mountains.\
  \ Moreover, despite of everything, I will tell you that everything was in order.\
  \ In absolute order."
