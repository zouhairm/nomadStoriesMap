Text: "Traveling literally saved my life. It took me out of depression after my divorce\
  \ in 2013 and into the unknown, where I started to interview random strangers about\
  \ their love and loss experiences so that I could prove three things for people\
  \ going through heartbreak:\n1) You are not alone. \n2) There is nothing wrong with\
  \ you\n3) There is a point to heartbreak--Discover Your Authentic Artist. \n\nI\
  \ started in Peru, hiked the Inca Trail where I received my inspiration to began\
  \ The Love Story. Then I wandered to NY, Boston, Montreal, Philly, and Washington\
  \ DC and began interviewing strangers about their love, loss and transformation\
  \ stories. When I got back to Los Angeles, I continued the project with artists,\
  \ indie and established, for a stand to take away the stigma of depression and lower\
  \ suicidal ideations by focusing on artistic expression to express pain and overcome\
  \ adversities. In 2006, I founded a nonprofit publication called The Love Story\
  \ (www.thelovestory.org), where I interview how people have transformed pain into\
  \ passion, and now I am taking the show on the road once more. \n\nI started travel\
  \ journaling and writing my narrative in the third person pov so I can begin mastering\
  \ compassion in the protagonist (myself), while capturing love stories of people\
  \ who have transformed pain into artistry. \n\nThis is the theme of journaling programs\
  \ I am building out: Fiction, Based on a True Story told in Third Person, presented\
  \ in a journal entry. \n\nNow I am on the path of fusing journaling, journalism,\
  \ and the personal journey. \n\nMy big project is to transform pain into a Three\
  \ Act Love Story:\nAct I: Discover Your Narrative --> www.thelovestory.org/discover-your-\
  \ narrative (Artist-Inspired Journaling)\nAct II: Call to Adventure --> www.breakyourheartopen.com\

  \ (Showcase Journaling)\n\nGiven this scholarship, I will be continuing the project\
  \ in Argentina to explore the indigenous creative expressions of the people. \n\
  I will be: \n1) interviewing artists + Continue creating the Program of Artist-Inspired\
  \ Journaling\n2) Adventure Journaling + Continue creating the Program of Adventure\
