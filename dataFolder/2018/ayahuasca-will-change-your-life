Text: "Despite being called \u201CThe Gateway to the Amazon,\u201D many young tourists\
  \ only know Iquitos, Peru, for the popular brew that comes out of the nearby jungle.\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019ll change your life,\u201D locals say.\nHere\u2019s what Wikipedia\
  \ has to say: \u201CPeople who have consumed ayahuasca report having spiritual revelations\
  \ regarding their purpose on earth and how to be the best person they possibly can.\u201D\
  \nOk, so that doesn\u2019t sound too bad.\nBut here\u2019s what the next paragraph\
  \ says: \u201CVomiting can follow ayahuasca ingestion [as well as] nausea, diarrhea,\
  \ and hot/cold flashes.\u201D\nThe thought of a group of people vomiting in a room\
  \ together sounds absolutely horrendous. And if the brew doesn\u2019t work its \u201C\
  magic\u201D on you, then you\u2019re just a spectator to this literal shit show.\n\
  Despite, people come in droves for the experience.\nPrior to my trip, I read that\
  \ a lot of expats ended up settling in Iquitos. I took this to mean that the city\
  \ must have a lot to offer foreigners. So in my planning, I set aside two days to\
  \ explore.\nBig mistake. I realized very quickly that there wasn\u2019t actually\
  \ much to do or see in Iquitos. All the sights, sounds and activities were outside\
  \ the city, in the jungle, obviously.\nWhile rethinking my itinerary at a bar, I\
  \ met a rattled Australian. She had just arrived to both a hostel and a city that\
  \ were much different than what she saw online. She too was gravely disappointed.\
  \ So her first order of business: a drink to calm her nerves. The second: \u201C\
  the first boat out of town.\u201D\nSo why were foreigners like us being caught off\
  \ guard by the gritty, underwhelming city, while others love it so much they establish\
  \ roots?\nThat question was later answered while I was socializing at a popular\
  \ expat restaurant. An American at a table nearby said she \"came for the ayahuasca\
  \ 7 years ago and never left.\u201D \n\u201CYou should try it; it\u2019ll change\
  \ your life,\" a group of \"artists\" echoed.\nWhen I told them I was from LA, their\
  \ eyes lit up and they tried selling me other drugs. Lovely. Because I was a foreigner,\
  \ I must be there for the ayahuasca, and because I was from LA, I must be into partying\
  \ and drugs.\nClearly foreigners looking for the ayahuasca experience are in such\
  \ abundance that we're all just thrown into the same pot. So no one comes here for\
  \ the amazing experience right across the river? Even locals quickly dismissed it\
  \ for the region\u2019s newer main attraction.\nMe, I\u2019ll take the humidity\
  \ and bugs of the jungle over vomiting and diarrhea any day \u2013 and so that was\
  \ what the Australian and I did."
