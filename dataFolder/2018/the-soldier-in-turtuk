Text: "It was not an easy decision. To be away from family for 5 weeks with no connectivity.\
  \ My responsibility towards my family verses an internship. I finally packed and\
  \ reached SECMOL campus at Phey, Ladakh. I planned a solo trip to visit the places\
  \ nearby.\n\nI was scared and excited at the same time.I for sure knew that this\
  \ could be my only chance to visit these places.Will I be able to do this 3 day\
  \ trip to a place called Turtuk that is merely 7 kms away from Pakistan and Pengong\
  \ Tso that required 26 hours of travel in shifts.These places are at a higher altitude\
  \ than Phey.The \u2018what ifs\u2019 constantly discouraged me from taking this\
  \ trip.There were thousands of thoughts constantly pushing me back but at the same\
  \ time, once in lifetime opportunity overweighed everything else and I went for\
  \ the trip. \n\nI traveled to Turtuk. Upon reaching the village, we were stopped\
  \ by the military check post where they checked our documents.I wasn\u2019t aware\
  \ of was I had to trek half a mile to reach that village. I stood at the threshold\
  \ of the village. The view was nothing less than entering a paradise or a fairytale.\
  \ \n\nI got a small lodge that gave me a basic bed & beddings for the night which\
  \ was more than sufficient.There was no network & electricity in that area.As I\
  \ roamed around, I met Mr Riyaz. He spoke about the history, demographics and other\
  \ details about Turtuk.\n\nOn our way back we were again stopped by the army personnel.They\
  \ started talking. Nothing in particular but a general conversation. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure if it was a good idea to divulge the information about myself. After all\
  \ a novice solo traveler has her own fears to deal with.I got down from the car\
  \ and we spoke over the cup of tea. They were from a small town in Uttar Pradesh.They\
  \ wanted to know about city life, general things. Later I realised that they wanted\
  \ to feel connected. They stay in those frigid conditions all the year round with\
  \ practically no emotional support. They survive in the extreme climate with bare\
  \ minimum supplies. The conversation was just meant to feel normal again. \n\nWe\
  \ continued our journey but I had a satisfaction after that conversation. I was\
  \ able to give a few minutes of my time to the brave men who are keeping a watch\
  \ to keep me safe at home. This was one experience that pushed me to edge.I challenged\
  \ myself at every point in this journey and am glad that I did. I was able to learn\
  \ a few good things about myself, which I felt but never experienced."
