Text: "The Foothills of Southern Alberta is a special place.  If you really look you\
  \ can find spectacular adventure and rich culture all along the eastern side of\
  \ the wild Rocky Mountains. \n\nGinger is the tiniest person I have ever met, but\
  \ her kindness and strength make her appear twenty feet tall.  She hunts game with\
  \ her husband to feed their growing family, and thoughtfully utilizes as many pieces\
  \ of the animals as possible. \n\nI remember the first time I went to visit her.\
  \ We needed to prepare our Eagle Whistles for an upcoming Sundance ceremony, and\
  \ she volunteered to help me. \n\nPulling up to their property I feel an attack\
  \ of nervous butterflies. The sign affixed to the rusted gate says, \u2018No Trespassing.\u2019\
  \   Pulling my little car in past the foreboding gate I close it behind me and continue\
  \ up the winding road to the blue house beyond the trees. Stepping out of my car\
  \ I\u2019m greeted by the familiar smell of woodsmoke. \n\nShe opens the door and\
  \ quickly brushes a long black strand of hair away with the back of her blood-stained\
  \ hand revealing a welcoming smile.  \u201CHi, Angel! Glad you could make it. Come\
  \ on in!\u201D  \n\nI enter the house behind her; Ginger motions for me to follow\
  \ her into the kitchen.  As I slip off my shoes I'm stopped by a very large turtle\
  \ in my path. She bends down to scoop him up, \u201C This is Star!\u201D  Holding\
  \ Star up with both hands I find myself face to face with a basketball-size creature\
  \ staring back at me with beady little eyes.  My face gives me away and she easily\
  \ reads my curiosity and slight horror about the blood-stained hands and forearms.\
  \ \n\n\u201C Oh, David just brought in an elk so we\u2019ve been busy with that.\u201D\
  \ \n\nGinger wears a bloodied apron that looks too large for her petite frame; moccasins\
  \ peek out from underneath the bottom. My eyes are drawn to the intricate sky blue\
  \ floral beadwork woven masterfully over the prairie yellow of the hide. She motions\
  \ to the mounds of elk meat and pans of thinly sliced pieces sitting on the kitchen\
  \ table.  The cardboard covering the floor and table are soaked darkest red. \n\n\
  She pulls out a chair for me to sit down. \u201C I\u2019ve been craving dry elk\
  \ meat for weeks now. Do you know how to cut meat?\u201D\n\nBefore I could answer\
  \ she hands me an apron and a knife.  \n\n\L\u201C This one is pretty sharp.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI set the knife down beside the pan of dripping flesh, roll up my sleeves,\
  \ and tie the apron around my waist.  \n\n\u201C I\u2019m ready.\u201D"
