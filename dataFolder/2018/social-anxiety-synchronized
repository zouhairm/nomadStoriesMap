Text: "I feel grounded as the dimmed lights slip down the earth plastered walls. A\
  \ contained intensity gathers my attention as the Persian jeweled rice reaches our\
  \ table. The pomegranate seeds vibrantly contrast the steam that billows from the\
  \ pilaf. My girlfriend leans into my ear and whispers, \u201CDooset daram eshgham.\u201D\
  \ I feel safe, stimulated, and...\n\n\u201CWhat do you do?\u201D the imposing couple\
  \ brashly asks, breaking me out of my muse. Only ten minutes earlier they were bragging\
  \ about some vague business venture. They proceed to defend themselves as if to\
  \ insist they were telling the truth. My mind is suspicious, anxious, and overwhelmed.\
  \ My anxiety heightens. My pulse quickens. Heat races to my face. The uncontrollable\
  \ perspiration begins. I excuse myself in an unsuccessful attempt to calm down.\
  \ The rest of dinner is unbearable.\n\nFor years social anxiety plagued my soul.\
  \ It's prevented me from enjoying a Key West sunset in Mallory Square and laughing\
  \ in unison as my friend Monica struggled to free herself from a rope swing in Alaska\u2019\
  s rainforest. Three years ago I felt safe, stimulated, and whole but social anxiety\
  \ ruthlessly took away the night I meant to propose. In its wake, I remember remnants\
  \ of unlived memories, burdens of wasted potential, and heartbreak over missed opportunities.\
  \ The last thing I expected was for my anxiety to dissipate the same way it reared\
  \ its ugly head. \n\nOn a cloudy morning in Bangkok, a woman named Anna is welcomed\
  \ into Suneta Hostel by Nattida\u2019s kind smile. Anna released her blonde hair\
  \ at the table and sat in front of me. I smile and ask, \u201CYour flight wasn\u2019\
  t awful, was it?\u201D With a detached look, she assured me it was. In mid-conversation\
  \ we are interrupted by a muscular guy wearing a tight cutoff and paisley shorts.\
  \ He asks, \u201CWhat do you do?\u201D I\u2019m taken aback by how often this question\
  \ is asked. Anna tells us she is a manager for Adidas. By design, he gives a long-winded\
  \ explanation of the company he runs. As Anna pushes for details he fumbles with\
  \ his memory. The truth is ultimately revealed by his look of guilt and downcast\
  \ stare. \n\nI read his expression and a burst of insight overtakes my prefrontal's\
  \ tendency to amplify judgment. It felt like opening my eyes to see the monster\
  \ sprinting towards me. I gained the power to anticipate and respond to its attacks.\
  \ My mind went from misinterpreting other\u2019s feelings to understanding each\
  \ person on a deeper level. I never expected the same question that ruined my life\
  \ to promise me freedom."
