Text: "Everywhere is noise. I meditate in Spain in England in France in India. And\
  \ the rattling of my brain is like a lawn mower constantly at work. Or that kitchen\
  \ light that\u2019s too bright and fuzzingly humming. Sometime I can sink into the\
  \ abyss of calm but context is important. \n\nI\u2019m about to venture to Argentina\
  \ to spend one month in the sivinanda ashram in barilloche. So I will be there already\
  \ in Argentina. The theme of my story is about how the place , the people, the language\
  \ , the food, the culture and the rhythm of life infuse within us a certain energy.\
  \ I am drawn to Argentina to South America from the pangs of my wild heart. For\
  \ I know in these lands are great teachings and much to be learned. \n\nMy story\
  \ would offer insight to others searching to raise their vibrations and truly transform\
  \ their lives in the face of modern sickness and adversity. Three years ago my health\
  \ was very bad and I almost lost my life. I was on the edge. Now I\u2019m off The\
  \ precipese of disaster I strive to share my healing story with others to inspire\
  \ and empower my fellow man l, enabling each of us to wake up to the profoundly\
  \ healing potential found within all of us."
