Text: "New York City, The big apple, The city that never sleeps.\nBeing a simple country\
  \ boy from a small rural town in New Zealand, half a world away. I wasn\u2019t always\
  \ fond of big City\u2019s that always seemed to be fast paced with lots of bright\
  \ lights, crowed with too many people and traffic bumper to bumper making it impossible\
  \ to get around. I was more entertained more by the idea of being in the slow paced,\
  \ peace and quiet of small country coastal town like which I grew up in. Where I\
  \ would never be stuck in traffic and could wave to all the friendly faces I knew\
  \ as I drove down the main street of town and yet 5minutes later I could be by surrounded\
  \ by nature on an amazing beach or break taking forest walks.\nSo my first time\
  \ going to New York city, I was really nervous and unsure of what to expect.  I\
  \ had heard a lot of good things about it, but i was I sure that it would be too\
  \ crowded which would make it hard to get around like you were constricted like\
  \ a sardine in a can. That it would be just blocks and blocks of big uninspiring\
  \ concrete buildings with no character that couldn\u2019t compare to what nature\
  \ had to offer. That it would be difficult to sleep with all the noises from cars\
  \ or other traffic from the road below or the lights shining so bight right outside\
  \ my window.\nTo my surprise on my first day out exploring with my local guide I\
  \ was absolutely blown away, the City was so much more than what I thought it would\
  \ be. For such a small city it seemed so big and spacious, yet you could easily\
  \ get around on foot or by using the simple to understand subway system which never\
  \ seemed packed at all. You never quite knew what would be around the next corner\
  \ or the next block. Like stumbling upon many different street performer\u2019s\
  \ or artists, or discovering something you didn\u2019t expect like the high line\
  \ walk or be it just relaxing in central park, forgetting that you in the middle\
  \ of a busy city and letting it take you miles away. The amount of different cultures\
  \ and types of cuisines you could experience from one borough to the next was amazing.\
  \ I even got the privilege of going into the crown of the statue of liberty (which\
  \ was not as big as you would think). Then catching a Knicks game at Madison square\
  \ garden and seeing an off Broadway musical. A feeling I soon won\u2019t forget\
  \ was getting to experience the incredible sobering feeling of being in ground zero.\
  \ \nThere was just so much to see, do and experience. \nNew York City was not what\
  \ I expected it to be."
