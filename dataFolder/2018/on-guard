Text: "His real name was for his mother and the police. Everyone else knew him as\
  \ Magrelo. \"Skinny\". An appropriate nickname for the diminutive frame outlined\
  \ on the summit of the favela. He always looked tiny, weighed down by the Kalashnikov\
  \ on his narrow shoulders.\n\nA few weeks into my stay, I saw a rare sight at the\
  \ locale that Magrelo patrolled. Tourists. A middle-aged couple hesitantly got off\
  \ their motorcycle taxis. They seemed on edge amidst the rough shacks and narrow\
  \ stairways. The signs of human life -  the funk blasting on the radio, the underwear\
  \ drying on a rooftop, the graffiti proclaiming passions and loyalties on every\
  \ wall - appeared to make them even more uncomfortable. \n\nThey had to be there\
  \ for the view. From the top of the favela, one could see miles of ocean curving\
  \ into Leblon and Ipanema but the drug trade usually kept away all but the brave\
  \ and the foolish. The hawk's eye view had strategic value for the dealers. It let\
  \ them see when trouble was brewing in the streets below and alert their companions.\
  \ That was what Magrelo was doing when the couple approached his lookout, delighted\
  \ as they took in the breathtaking vista. The photos would be totally worth their\
  \ harrowing ascent. \n\nThey were struggling to capture the panorama in a selfie\
  \ when the woman spotted Magrelo.  As he moved towards them, she clutched her bag\
  \ closer. Her nervous motion wiped out Magrelo's smile. He had been about to offer\
  \ to take a picture.\n\nLife had not been kind to Magrelo. A broken home, a hopeless\
  \ school, and discriminating employers all stacked the odds against him. Yet for\
  \ all the stoicism he maintained in the face of life's injustices, he was stung\
  \ by the tourist's instinctive mistrust. He indignantly said to no one in particular\
  \ that he was guarding the community, not robbing. He sat pensive the rest of the\
  \ day, eyes on his slum, his world.\n\nYears later, the teenagers with war weaponry\
  \ would be replaced by uniformed men with equally heavy arms. Outsiders would flood\
  \ in after \"pacification\", the creation of peace, their fear replaced by a mild\
  \ embarrassment about the lingering poverty in the midst of the \"favela chique\"\
  \ - the fashionable slum. The drug trade would go on, but no one would worry too\
  \ much because everyone trusted that only the poor got caught in crossfire. \n\n\
  The famous view would become even more coveted after beautiful people started flocking\
  \ to it but in my mind, it would always be associated with Magrelo, watching over\
  \ his troubled paradise."
