Text: "Caught in the curfew in Srinagar, pelted with stones by masked teenagers, who\
  \ probably had no idea what the pelting stood for as long as they were paid, we\
  \ had been rescued to a military camp by the army.We had seen crowds attack our\
  \ camp with fire and the army forming a security line to defend us. We were strangers,\
  \ bound by the fact that all of us were at the wrong place at the wrong time. Some\
  \ of us were tourists and some on a religious pilgrimage, who were the actual targets\
  \ of the riots.  Hours turned into a whole day. \nFinally we got to leave for the\
  \ airport to fly out of this paradise turned hell.Our driver ,Yunus and 3 of us\
  \ in a jeep. Being back home is all we cared about. It would give the much needed\
  \ false sense of security. After all, out of sight is out of mind. We followed the\
  \ convoy. Yunus instructed us \u201CDuck below the seat. You don\u2019t look local.They\
  \ can\u2019t distinguish you from Yatris\u201D. \nSomehow we managed to venture\
  \ away from the convoy.  Suddenly we were stopped by a barricade & 4 masked men\
  \ surrounded the jeep.They asked Yunus \u2013 \u201CWhere are you coming from?\u201D\
  . He replied \u201CThey are from Mumbai. Tourists to Ladakh. Let them go. They are\
  \ students not Yatris\u201D.The man looked confused. He asked his partner \u201C\
  \ What should we do?\u201D. I started crying. I kept repeating \u201C Please let\
  \ us go\u201D, I could not take my eyes off the knife in his hand.  All I could\
  \ think of is the painful death which awaited us. How would it feel to be stabbed.\
  \ His partner replied \u201CKill the bastards\u201D. I couldn\u2019t believe this\
  \ was happening. Did I hear it wrong? I closed my eyes and covered my face to stop\
  \ seeing what would follow.\nAnd the next thing I knew was the car zooming at an\
  \ unimaginable speed. Yunus\u2013 the young lad who was a decade younger than all\
  \ of us had the presence of mind to press the accelerator in those seconds of debate\
  \ between the terrorists. And we sped to freedom.\nThe value of life can only be\
  \ imagined when it is at stake.\nYunus dropped us to safety and headed back to his\
  \ village amidst the chaos.\nWe touched Mumbai only to know there was a cloud burst\
  \ in Ladakh, the following day.\nYunus was unreachable as Ladakh remained isolated\
  \ with all communication cut.\nAfter a week we heard from him. His village was washed\
  \ off. His family had been rescued and he was alive. That\u2019s all I wanted to\
  \ hear to feel some solace. \nLife and time has moved on since but I stay bonded\
  \ to him and the 2 co-travellers in some strange unexplained way which can only\
  \ be described as surreal."
