Text: "It has been almost 50 years ago now that my parents first met in the city of\
  \ Vienna.  My father was a young career diplomat at that time in his first international\
  \ posting.  My mother was a young scholarship student doing her postgraduate program\
  \ abroad.  Although their homes in Bangkok were mere blocks apart, my parents never\
  \ met until their first encounter in Vienna. They fell madly in love and after a\
  \ brief courtyard; were married and soon started a young family.  \n\nUnfortunately,\
  \ twenty years on we were faced with a tragedy.  My parents were in a car accident.\
  \  My father passed away but miraculously, my mom survived.  She sustained injuries\
  \ that took months to treat.  However, the most challenging injuries were invisible\
  \ to the eyes.  Losing my father took the wind out of her.  As she was physically\
  \ unable to attend my dad's funeral rites, my mom never had closure.  \n\nIn 2004,\
  \ I brought my mom back to Vienna and it would be her first time back to Vienna\
  \ in over 30 years.  It took a lot of courage for her to return again as the gravity\
  \ of my dad\u2019s passing would oftentimes dwarf past memories of happier times.\
  \  Our trip together was a walk down memory lane.  There was one place my mom really\
  \ wanted to see and that was the small chapel she and my dad got married in.  It\
  \ was a quaint chapel located amidst a vast meadow plain.  This chapel was in the\
  \ outskirts of Vienna so we had to take a public bus there.   We got on a  bus but\
  \ soon realized that we had no idea if we were headed the right direction.  An older\
  \ couple, impeccably dressed was seated close to us and kindly offered to help.\
  \  They suggested that we get off the same bus stop and they would take us in their\
  \ car to this chapel.   After many hours, we were not making any headways.  It had\
  \ gotten late, so the couple took us to a local eatery and even paid for dinner\
  \ despite our cries to the contrary.  We shared with this couple about my dad\u2019\
  s life, about his dreams and aspirations and the tragic circumstances of his death.\
  \  Although this couple was a complete stranger to us only a few hours ago, the\
  \ connection we had felt as though, they were able to see straight through into\
  \ the souls of our hearts.  As the evening drew to close, the couple kindly drove\
  \ us back to our hotel in downtown Vienna.  We bid each other farewell with hugs\
  \ and kisses and were overcome with a profound sense of sadness for it truly felt\
  \ as though we were saying goodbye to two dear and long-standing family friends."
