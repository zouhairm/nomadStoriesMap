Text: "San Francisco, California. The two of us had been walking for hours under a\
  \ scorching sun, squeezing out our days in the city, not sure we would ever return.\
  \ Despite our stiff legs and emerging blisters, we set off for the iconic Golden\
  \ Gate bridge. Not even the chilly breeze nor the thick fog that dominated the bay\
  \ could dampen our spirits. A stroll down the bridge, contemplating the boats. The\
  \ breathtaking views. The feeling of being on top of the world.\nLips cracked after\
  \ hours under the sun and the wind, the excitement was gone after our peregrination.\
  \ Exhausted, wishing for teleportation, we knew we still had a long walk to the\
  \ hotel, so we started out in our quest to find a bus. To our despair, the driver\
  \ of the only bus that passed by closed the doors as we na\xEFvely handed him a\
  \ $20 note. I had that feeling of being lost in the unknown, that mix of fear and\
  \ excitement: you know eventually you\u2019ll figure it out, but you can\u2019t\
  \ help thinking what if I don\u2019t?\n\nFinally, a bus! I asked the driver for\
  \ directions. He told us to get in at once and didn\u2019t even let us pay. We mortifiedly\
  \ accepted under the askance looks of the other passengers.\nAt the final stop,\
  \ the driver told us to stay. We exchanged a nervous look, knowing we were still\
  \ far from the hotel, so we stayed.\nIt turned out he was a Tunisian refugee who\
  \ had come to the US in search  of a better life. He had worked everywhere, from\
  \ bars to taxis. He kept saying how much he yearned to live in Europe, especially\
  \ in France or Spain, our homeland. 'I so want to visit Spain. Where should I go?\
  \ What food should I get?' He sounded as if he were about to travel there, although\
  \ he manifestly knew it was a far-fetched dream.\nHe kept talking about California\u2019\
  s problem with homelessness and drugs in a passionate, yet resigned way. He accepted\
  \ the harsh reality for thousands of people, but repeated all the mantras of the\
  \ so-called American dream\u2026 if you don\u2019t make it, it\u2019s because you\
  \ don\u2019t work hard enough.\nWe learned about his pride in his achievements:\
  \ his job, his health insurance, his plans to bring his family to the US. He infected\
  \ us with his enthusiasm, but we didn\u2019t miss the struggles he had gone through.\n\
  By the time we got to the city centre we noticed the hour we had spent talking to\
  \ him had changed us.\nWe knew we would never forget him, our guardian angel who\
  \ had taught us a lesson about optimism.\nThe last thing we expected was to meet\
  \ the embodiment of the American dream, and for it to be so humane."
