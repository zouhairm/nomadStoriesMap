Text: "Hi everyone!\nI\u2019m Daly, and I hope you're going to enjoy my story. \n\
  Maybe a smart person that wants to win a writing trip to Argentina, wouldn\u2019\
  t tell you about this country, would choose another one, because maybe you would\
  \ like to give this opportunity to someone that never went there. By the way, even\
  \ though I\u2019ve travelled a lot in my almost 21 years of life, going to Argentina\
  \ was the most beautiful, unexpected, amazing, extraordinary and emotional adventure\
  \ that I\u2019ve ever experienced. So I decided to share with you my memories about\
  \ this wonderful country.\nMy grandma's grandmother came from Argentina, but after\
  \ moving in Italy, she had to face war and poverty while rising her children, so\
  \ she didn't think about teaching them spanish. That\u2019s why my granny knows\
  \ just 3 words in this language.\nWhen I heard this fact I was very happy, I've\
  \ always felt the sensation to belong to this country, but I wasn't sure. Until\
  \ I get there.\nI have to be honest, at first, when the plane landed, I didn\u2019\
  t realize that my biggest dream had just become reality. But the next day, when\
  \ I saw the \u201CObelisco\u201D in Plaza de la Rep\xFAblica, I cried the hell out\
  \ of myself!\nI thought: \u201CI\u2019m finally here, where half of my blood belongs\u201D\
  . I felt happy and free.\nBut most of my happiness didn't come from places, food\
  \ or music. It came from people and from the connection that I've established with\
  \ them.\nThey are spontaneus, creative, kind, funny and they have a big heart. I\
  \ was hosted by a loving family, leaded by a sweet woman called Rosa, who since\
  \ day one treated me like if I was part of her family.\nYou can feel their warm\
  \ hearts and their beautiful souls in every occasion. No matter what they're doing,\
  \ they'll always help you if you need and they'll always do it with a smile on.\
  \ Still today I am convinced that this experience wouldn\u2019t have been the same,\
  \ if I\u2019d have met different people, if I wouldn\u2019t have been infected by\
  \ all this joy in the air and this little sparkle in the eyes of every single person\
  \ that I got the honor to know. They took care of me, they showed me their traditions,\
  \ they made me understand that life is beautiful. They made me discover things about\
  \ myself I didn\u2019t even noticed. Those places were beautiful, yes, but what\
  \ I miss the most today is people. While I was there I lived like if I was one of\
  \ them and that's thanks to\npeople. Just thanks to them I can call Argentina \u201C\
  home\u201D and I can call argentinian people \u201Chome\u201D too. My beautiful,\
  \ colorful, overseas HOME."
