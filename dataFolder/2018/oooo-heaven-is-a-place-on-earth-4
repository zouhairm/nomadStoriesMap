Text: "It turns out that Eden is in Utah.\n\nAfter navigating our 36-foot RV, Hopper,\
  \ through rush-hour traffic in Los Angeles, parallel-parking that monstrosity in\
  \ the narrow alleys of San Diego, and surviving the 101 degree temperatures in Nevada,\
  \ our whole crew was feeling a bit like Tom Hanks in \"Castaway\". Melanie, a fellow\
  \ traveler was one more 500-mile drive away from forming an intimate relationship\
  \ with a volleyball. Halfway through Utah on our journey to the Bonneville Salt\
  \ Flats, it was agreed that we needed to stop ASAP and find somewhere to cool down\
  \ for a while and do some swimming. \nUtah did not seem very promising for this\
  \ mission. As we were driving, the land surrounding us would be the result of a\
  \ desert growing vertically into the sky. Just dry mountains and rock. Luckily,\
  \ our resourceful leader, Chelsea, had found a place that looked like it could provide\
  \ some relief. She had pulled up her map on her smartphone, and just looked for\
  \ any blue spot. The blue dot closest to us was in a place called Mona.\nMy expectations\
  \ were low. I was just happy to be heading somewhere to swim for a bit and not be\
  \ driving. When we approached the area that Google told us the blue spot would be,\
  \ I started to question Chelsea's map reading ability. We were driving through a\
  \ neighborhood in the valley of a mountain. A man was riding a horse down the sidewalk,\
  \ and clearly that was normal because exactly zero other people were staring at\
  \ him the way we were.\nWe turned onto a dirt road that seemed to be going right\
  \ through someone's field, and entered an archway of trees. We parked on the side\
  \ of this road in the shade, and hopped out to search for this oasis. \nOn the other\
  \ side of the trees, there it was-- A pond in the valley, surrounded by green and\
  \ bushes and cattails. Kids and adults were flinging themselves from rope swings\
  \ that looked extremely worn, but besides those ropes, the whole place looked untouched.\
  \ It felt like we had somehow passed through a portal and fell right into 1950s\
  \ America. \nWe took off our shoes, our sweaty, driver's seat t-shirts, and walked\
  \ around the pond to a spot closer to the mountains, hidden by tall grass. Stepping\
  \ into the water, my feet touched slippery moss on freezing stones. The water was\
  \ pristine, and reflected the mountains behind us.  \nWe spent the day in that little\
  \ Garden of Eden, floating in the clear water, swinging from the rope, writing in\
  \ our journals. The Bonneville Salt Flats were amazing, but Mona, Utah was Heaven."
