Text: "\"In Morocco, my friend, nothing has fixed price!\"\n\nPeople are wrong to\
  \ assume that the joy of life comes solely from human relationships, it's all around\
  \ in anything you can experience. An interesting world comes not to those that wait,\
  \ but to those that step forward into unfamiliar territory and try. I've been to\
  \ many great souks of the world, from the Middle East to Africa, but nothing prepares\
  \ you for Morocco\u2019s persistence, which intimidates the uninitiated. You have\
  \ to allow for things to happen in life, mostly to yourself, so the trick is to\
  \ embrace the experience, make some low cost mistakes, and try your hand at bargaining\
  \ with the best in the world.\n\nAsk anyone that knows me, I have no shame in asking\
  \ for cheaper or discounted prices, in this respect Morocco is my Mecca. \n\nI cross\
  \ the medina towards the less popular alleyways, to see the local women yell and\
  \ scream at the store keepers... this is the place for me. If you want good food,\
  \ eat where the locals eat. If you want a good deal, shop where the locals shop.\
  \ They are under no obligation to sell it to you, and they won't sell at a loss,\
  \ so why not make a sport of it and have some fun.\n\nSo, I present to you JoJo's\
  \ rules for sparing with the locals;\n- Get your blood sugar up before diving in.\n\
  - Have an idea of what it is worth here (not back home). Know what your limit is\
  \ and where to draw the line.\n- Always learn a few Arabic phrases to engage them\
  \ with, it is courteous and will get you far. \n- Know that they have an arsenal\
  \ of sales tactics up their Djellaba sleeve, so leave your emotions at the medina\
  \ gate and never fall for the peasant talk \"I need to feed my kids/family/village/camel/goat\"\
  . I repeat, they will never sell at a loss. \n- These guys are masters at getting\
  \ you to buy things you didn't know you wanted, but can't live without, so don't\
  \ go buying the first item you find, use that as an experience to gauge value, and\
  \ take this knowledge into your next negotiation\n- There will always be a few that\
  \ refuse to budge, waiting for the next pasty white foreigner, so shake their hand,\
  \ tell them \"Shukran\" for their time, and go to the next shop. In fact they will\
  \ likely chase you up the street/alleyway shouting please of \"oaha, oaha!\" (Ok,\
  \ ok!)\n\nMany a time I've heard the odd profanity with a shaking clenched fist,\
  \ and been told that I \"am like Berber woman\" (Berber woman are renown for being\
  \ tight with their money). \n\nFor me, it's the ultimate compliment for a woman\
  \ traveller in Morocco."
