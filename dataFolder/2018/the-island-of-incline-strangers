Text: "The island of Capri? Yeah right, it should be called the island of incline.\n\
  \nThe thought soon became my mantra as I slowly trudged my way up to my flat for\
  \ the weekend. The flat was situated at the very top of the island\u2019s numerous\
  \ slanted paths that wound through the town like a maze. As I carried my backpack\
  \ filled to the brim, I felt intimidation creep in as around every corner loomed\
  \ another set of steep stairs. Little did I know there were 15 buses circling the\
  \ island, no doubt filled with better rested people than I.\n\nUpon reaching what\
  \ felt like the summit of Mt. Everest, I could finally take in my surroundings.\
  \ Looking down upon the jagged rocks and turquoise water framing the picturesque\
  \ city, a feeling of complete awe overpowered me. I noticed ceramic, hand-painted\
  \ tiles identifying the buildings that stood before me; my flat was called la turista.\
  \ \n\nCuriosity overcame me as I ran inside while simultaneously stripping off my\
  \ bags so I could begin exploring the island. I blissfully strolled through the\
  \ town center, as vendors seduced me with their offerings of fresh seafood and Limoncello,\
  \ and children played calciol in the streets. Islanders were out and about, despite\
  \ it being noon, and one even called out a jaunty welcome as I walked by.\n\nSoon,\
  \ the crowds of tourists began to thin, and I found myself walking through secluded\
  \ streets of homes and small farms. After about 10 minutes without a soul in sight,\
  \ I spotted an elderly man approaching down the road. The local must have noticed\
  \ my aimless disposition, as he began waving his arms towards me. As I moved closer,\
  \ I realized he was trying to give me directions, despite the fact that I did not\
  \ speak Italian and him not an ounce of English. He pointed towards the Tyrrhenian\
  \ Sea then continuously turned his body left, right, right, left. I somehow began\
  \ picking up on his message, thank you Italian nonverbals. Overcome with a sense\
  \ of adventure, I followed his directions without knowing where they would lead.\
  \ \n\nA long downhill hike later, I stumbled upon the legendary Blue Grotto, a site\
  \ I never would have found without the help of the stranger. As the only tourist\
  \ there, I had the opportunity to take in its magnificence in solidarity, just as\
  \ a local would. I felt an overwhelming sense of gratitude and awe wash over me.\
  \ By that time, the man was likely a mile away, but I called out to him in thanks\
  \ anyways as I felt a single tear of joy stream down my face."
