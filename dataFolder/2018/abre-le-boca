Text: "I wonder how many people will talk of the lonliness that you become accustomed\
  \ to while traveling. I wonder if anyone will talk of the alienating feeling that\
  \ comes with coming home. I remember arriving in the dusty village of Palomino,\
  \ Columbia one morning after heading to the morning dark crisp edged bus station\
  \  in Cartagena, the daily hot windy city that blew dust into your very bones, the\
  \ city with the sweet old woman who could still dance circles around you in the\
  \ kitchen every morning as you salted your egg, that  hot unobtainable city crawling\
  \ with sand and ancient stones. I stood there, waiting for the bus, watching an\
  \ electrical wire spark and snap on the wind down the beach a bit. Sometimes I love\
  \ riding the bus more than anything else. When the ocean is a green you've never\
  \ seen before and the palm trees become one strong moment that challenges your vision\
  \ to tearing. Getting lost down the beach so that the girl next to me can deliver\
  \ a birthday cake to her friend. I wish I had had the courage at that moment to\
  \ talk to her in my broken spanish and see if I could stay for a little while. \
  \ I went to the beach every day at sunrise and came back at sundown. I couldn't\
  \ believe the silence that was beckoning me. \nThe calm cool static that brought\
  \ only the most tender to me as I ran into the sea again and again, becoming comfortable\
  \ with myself. That is what traveling alone teaches you more than anything, how\
  \ to move along while holding strong to yourself when you know that's all you've\
  \ got left."
