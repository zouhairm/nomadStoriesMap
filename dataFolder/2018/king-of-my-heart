Text: "King of my Heart\n\nYou were the least that I expected \nDidn't see that coming\
  \ when I checked it\nOut of something bad, too much drama, to get this\n\nOutside,\
  \ the air is fresh\nI walk to the shops out of the mesh\nOut of cash but a heartbeat\
  \ in my chest\n\nA change of faces, a pretender is gone\nHis own stupid actions\
  \ got a narcissist done\nBut I must admit, I had no problem with his kind of fun\n\
  \nI try to explain to you my point of view\nAnd it's a real surprise to listen to\
  \ you\nA true gentleman out of the blue\n\nWe sat together for a few drinks\nAnd\
  \ you poured me some red wine and you made me think\nMy tears break on the plastic\
  \ cup's brink\n\nPlease don't ever go out of reach\nSomeday we might even go out\
  \ to the beach\nWhen we meet again on the dark city street\n\nYour words mean the\
  \ world and you said I'm amazing\nI'll find my luck in life and you see through\
  \ my skin\nYou were the best and that knife you gave me my favourite thing\nNot\
  \ only by your name you're the real King \u2665\uFE0F\n\nI decided to send in a\
  \ poem because it was the least that I expected to meet someone like this in a smal\
  \ simple tourist shop in Egypt. Sometimes the best conversations and memories are\
  \ made when we don't expect them and they can make us forever happy to remember\
  \ what life is about:)\nIt was the first time that I ever really was MYSELF. Traveling\
  \ shows you a part of your soul and the soul of the whole world with so many amazing\
  \ people. It is my heartfelt goal to see as much of this beautiful world as I can\
  \ and to meet more amazing people like Mina <3"
