Text: "I arrived by tuk-tuk in San Marcos La Laguna, Guatemala, a quiet town beside\
  \ volcanic Lake Atitlan and home to several Mayan ethnic groups, most notably the\
  \ Tz'utujil and Kaqchikel people, and a significant international expat population.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t long before a boy around the age of 10 years old with dark, short\
  \ spiky hair, wearing a graphic t-shirt, and jeans, noticed I looked lost and offered\
  \ to guide me, for a small sum of money, to \u201CLa Cambalacha,\u201D the school\
  \ where I was to volunteer, \u201CJust give me one Quetzal. You look poor,\u201D\
  \ he said. I smiled. I followed him past a pack of wild dogs in the road. \u201C\
  They won\u2019t bother you.\u201D We departed from the paved road onto a densely\
  \ forested trail where I exchanged \u201Chellos\u201D with the few people we walked\
  \ past - nomads in feather earrings, a man carrying a hatchet, a Mayan woman wearing\
  \ kaleidoscope colored garments. \n\nAt the gate to the school, its founder, Gabriela,\
  \ greeted me - and my new friend. \u201CMiguel,\u201D she said. \u201CHe\u2019s\
  \ a student of ours.\u201D She showed me around the spacious grounds; bleacher seating\
  \ for performances, a mirrored room for dance, art supplies, and a cluster of huts\
  \ nestled among the trees - my home for the next week. We stepped inside my hut\
  \ where several scorpions clung to the walls of the room. \u201CThey shouldn\u2019\
  t bother you,\u201D said Gabriela \u201CBut if you get stung, don\u2019t worry!\
  \ You\u2019ll be fine after a day in bed.\u201D\n\nThe next morning, I headed to\
  \ my first class. With a guitar in my arms and 20 children in front of me - including\
  \ Miguel, we sang a classic Spanish nursery song, \u201CLos Pollitos,\u201D or \u201C\
  Little Chicks.\u201D First in Spanish, then slowly in English. As the days went\
  \ by, I added new songs to their repertoire, including the call and response, \u201C\
  Hola, Hello.\u201D \n\nWhile the kids accompanied the music with shakers, tambourines,\
  \ and other simple rhythm instruments, Miguel seemed more interested in my guitar.\
  \ So, I offered to teach him how to play a class favorite, \u201CHola, Hello.\u201D\
  \  It didn\u2019t take long for him to learn - he already knew the guitar chords.\
  \ During my last class, Miguel lead the song this time. And then we sang our goodbyes."
