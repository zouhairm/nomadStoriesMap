Text: "I am perched on a rock-hewn ledge overlooking the haphazard sprawl of Lisbon\u2019\
  s Bairro Alto district. Before me, the sun dies a glorious death over whitewashed\
  \ houses with red-tiled roofs. It is my last day in the city and I am lost. I have\
  \ been tipped off that Mariza, the reigning queen of fado, will be singing an intimate\
  \ set at a bar in Bairro Alto. After spending the evening manoeuvring a labyrinth\
  \ of alleyways with my nose in a map and trying to wangle directions out of flat\
  \ cap wearing hipsters, I\u2019ve finally given up. It seems an encounter with Portugal\u2019\
  s melancholic, 200-year old music is just not meant to be. The aroma of salted fish\
  \ fills the air shaking me out of this reverie. I follow my nose to an old man selling\
  \ sardines and salt cod in a cobbled alley. He flashes me a tobacco-stained grin\
  \ and gestures to the bacalhau hissing angrily in his skillet. My stomach growls\
  \ expectantly. I order a plate. Above us a surly grandmother hangs her husband\u2019\
  s Barney-purple underpants on a clothesline. The vendor surveys me for a moment\
  \ before asking, \u201CYou lost?\u201D I nod, my mouth still full, and mumble a\
  \ reply, \u201CI\u2019m looking for Mariza\u2026the fado singer...\u201D I fish\
  \ out a scrap of paper from my back pocket and show him an address scrawled in eyeliner.\
  \ He glances at it and then looks up at me, rheumy grey eyes magnified behind thick\
  \ brown bifocals. \u201CSon, for fado you don\u2019t look, you listen.\u201D \n\n\
  Later as I wander through a warren of lanes waking up for the night, I ruminate\
  \ on his words. And almost on cue, the music finds me \u2013 plucked nylon strings\
  \ forming minor harmonies that ebb and flow like waves on a beach in the Algarve.\
  \ I round the corner to a packed lantern-lit tavern. Inside, an audience listens\
  \ in respectful silence as two elderly men sitting by the bar coax emotion out of\
  \ the rosewood bodies of their guitarras. Next to me, a woman with blonde braids\
  \ gets up and moves to the front. Dressed in a casual white shirt and jeans she\
  \ could be anyone. The light catches her face and I realise how wrong I am. Mariza\u2019\
  s voice belies her slight frame as it springs forward with a force I do not expect,\
  \ quivering like raindrops on a leaf. And before I know it I am transported to a\
  \ time when girls pined for their lovers on storm-battered coasts and fishwives\
  \ begged the sea to return their men to dry shores. Fado means fate in Portuguese.\
  \ And in that moment, I have no doubt that this evening has been written in the\
  \ stars."
