Text: "It was a fine morning in Lindi. We were walking the path to the school perched\
  \ on a sloping hill surrounded by divine rural greenery. Arrived on time, we greeted\
  \ the teachers sipping on rainwater.\n\nNo one seemed to have taken notice of a\
  \ teenage student half kneeling on the porch, his elbows touching his thighs, head\
  \ down, torso leaning forward. Position unbearable for long stretch of time, with\
  \ the sun soon to peak only making it worse. It was evidently a punishment.Snap.\n\
  \nFast forward the length of a session - 45 minutes. To my astonishment the stoical\
  \ figure of the disgraced pupil was still squatting there - shivering with muscle\
  \ strain, the pain carving furrows on his face where tears and sweat would merge\
  \ into a running river.\n\nOf course I was aware corporal punishment is deplored\
  \ as a method of discipline in Tanzania. I also knew the law allowed every school\
  \ up to four canes. Caning was part of the culture there, a normality I was yet\
  \ to witness.\n\nThe teachers were congregated at one side of the porch trying to\
  \ dispel the heat, oblivious to the ordeal developing two metres away from them.\
  \ Mr. M. - the second master of the school - was sitting across in his chair shouting\
  \ questions at the sinner, the tone of his voice suggesting he was demanding his\
  \ remorse. Standing next to the teachers as if I was one of them (perpetrators),\
  \ utterly shocked I reached for my phone to film the injustice. Technology fail\
  \ has never angered me this much before. The phone was dead just like the young\
  \ boy\u2019s spirit shattering before my eyes. \n\nUnleashing the full power of\
  \ his middle aged muscled hand, Mr.M. violently battered the boy with a cane. Unabashed\
  \ by our presence, he delivered hit after hit on the wretched flesh, on knuckles,\
  \ on limbs, on a spine that was giving in underneath the relentless lash. The guy\
  \ was taking pride and joy in his duty.\n\nI stood there in silence, helplessly\
  \ confronting the villain in my head. The internal fight was dragging for eternity.\
  \ My instincts and basic humane empathy were kicking in and trudging impatiently\
  \ on my heart. The reason though - compromising the team and our mission - crippled\
  \ my courage. Tears rolled out frantically onto my cheeks \u2013 a despair attempt\
  \ in demonstrating disgust and commiseration.\n\nAlas, I was urged to look away,\
  \ rushed out of the devils porch and offered a \u201CThere was nothing you could\
  \ do\u201D. Wasn\u2019t there? \n\nThe politics behind it had won.\n\nRumour had\
  \ it, the boy got caught with a woman earlier that day..."
