Text: "I don\u2019t really know what a proper adventure is, but I\u2019ve realize\
  \ that a trip is not just on an exotic country. That\u2019s why my memoir of London\
  \ is full of unusual events. I have been there for few months; I was doing an internship\
  \ during my second year of University and in the meanwhile I was working in a caf\xE8\
  \ to save some money and to pay the rent. Because yeah, London it\u2019s pretty\
  \ expensive. Anyway, it was one of those nights. And what I mean by that is that\
  \ I worked from 9 am to 9 pm and then I had the great idea of hanging out with a\
  \ couple of friends. So I agreed to go to North London, around Camden, even if I\
  \ used to live in Peckham, and of course, I ended up losing the last train home.\
  \ 3 am, and I was considering to call an Huber when I heard \u201Chey\u201D. It\
  \ turned out to be a guy I saw on the tube the day before. I was reading Infinite\
  \ Jest and he approached me, asking me what I was reading. So he said that I had\
  \ a really strong American accent, which is weird because I\u2019m not even an English\
  \ mother tongue. I told him that it\u2019s probably because I\u2019ve  definitely\
  \ watched too many movies. He laughed and the conversation was over. When I saw\
  \ him again he had lost the last train too. Now I have to precise a thing. He wasn\u2019\
  t really the nicest guy a girl would like to meet at night. A tattooed guy who looked\
  \ a bit like a skinhead, and he was also kind of tipsy at that time. His name was\
  \ Alex. \u201CYou know I\u2019m not trying to rape you, right?\u201D that\u2019\
  s literally what he said. I kind of laughed, which confused him a bit but he smiled\
  \ back. We started walking, looking for the next bus stop and he started talking\
  \ about his life. He was a Dante fan, and a vegan. I originally thought he was a\
  \ weird hipster. Born and raised in South East London he left exactly when it began\
  \ to be a decent place where to live. \u201CIt\u2019s not honest anymore, that place.\
  \ I used to go out with the messed up kids but know they sell you shoes for 300\
  \ pounds\u201D he told me. Basically he left the right place on the right moment.\
  \ But I understood. A need of being real. Really real. Not society kind of real.\n\
  \ I have never seen Alex again. We spent 30 minutes together. Then he took a bus\
  \ and I took another one. He didn\u2019t ask me out, or for my number, he didn\u2019\
  t even try to hit on me to be honest. \u201C Well, goodbye\u201D he said. \nOriginally\
  \ I though he really needed to talk because London it\u2019s like that. You try\
  \ to approach even lamp posts. Just after I realize that it was me, that really\
  \ needed to talk with somebody. And that happened, so thank you."
