Text: "I was in college when my mother died. The pain of that loss left me unable\
  \ and unwilling to pursue my chosen field of Filmmaking and I wound up a caregiver\
  \ for special needs adults. Born in Los Angeles, I had lived in Japan, Israel, New\
  \ York, and traveled far and wide searching for something. I found that something,\
  \ not a world away, but in the air. In the bathroom no less. \n\nMy clients hired\
  \ me to take their special boys to New York and warned me that an \u201Caccident\u201D\
  \ could happen. I\u2019d never done this before but I went ahead with open eyes\
  \ and a open heart. \n\nUp to this point, I\u2019d been struggling with my self\
  \ worth in the seemingly unending grief but still needed to make a living. \n\n\
  So I boarded the plane and felt that sorely missed, much needed flash of excitement\
  \ at the prospect of traveling again. There would be no exotic dishes, No language\
  \ barrier, and no unexpected surfing in Tokyo Bay with some random French travelers.\
  \ Yet I felt like something good was near. Turns out, it was very near; down the\
  \ aisle in the tiny  bathroom at the back of the plane.\n\nThe pilot announced our\
  \ imminent arrival to JFK and I breathed a sigh of relief. Then it happened. One\
  \ of my clients had had the aforewarned \u201Caccident\u201D \n\nSo with great trepidation\
  \ and a churning stomach, we made the slow walk to the bathroom. I joked around\
  \ about the situation with him to lessen the discomfort, more for myself than him;\
  \ he was used to this. And it was only after a bunch of awkward stalling that I\
  \ told him to drop his pants. With the sanitary kit his mom had packed I stormed\
  \ the beaches of Normandy and got him cleaned up like new. \n\nAfter I sent him\
  \ back to his seat, I washed my hands and stood outside the bathroom, still in disbelief.\
  \ The stewardess said she\u2019d admired my ability to keep a good humor and gave\
  \ me a shot of top shelf whisky. \n\nAs I walked back to my seat I laughed as I\
  \ thought \u201CI\u2019m ready to be a dad; if I can do this to a 30 year old man,\
  \ I can handle a baby\u201D \n\nAnd that\u2019s when it hit me. All the emptiness,\
  \ all the sorrow, all the infinite darkness that clouded my future, just dissolved.\
  \ A single tear fell from my face. I could be a dad. And if I could be a dad, then\
  \ there was a future for me. Suddenly the weight I\u2019d carried for two interminable\
  \ years was lifted. \n\nSuddenly life had meaning. And I hadn\u2019t found it a\
  \ world away, or even across the country. I had found it in the cramped confines\
  \ of a bathroom in a Boeing 737 jetliner."
