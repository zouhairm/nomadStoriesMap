Text: "It\u2019s just supposed to be lunch, but a trip to one of Havana\u2019s oldest\
  \ and most famous restaurants requires digestion of a different sort. Cuba has already\
  \ been more confounding than I expected, and La Guarida, in a few hours one afternoon,\
  \ presents the entire range of bewildering impressions this country leaves on the\
  \ uninitiated. \n\nWe\u2019ve heard plenty about this legendary eatery in an old\
  \ building in central Havana but are still brought up short as we approach on unkempt\
  \ streets and arrive at a door that exposes a scene of extreme disarray. Our eyes\
  \ dart over scaffolding, piles of bricks and lumber, cavernous rooms open to the\
  \ sky, and a staircase that looks as if it may not bear our weight. \u201CWe\u2019\
  re going to EAT here?\u201D my sister asks, alarmed.\n\nThe former mansion, now\
  \ subdivided into a partially abandoned tenement, unfolds from thick wooden doors\
  \ caked with dried paint. Beckoned by a headless goddess, we take our first steps\
  \ upward, turning to view our progress as we climb. On the second level, we gape\
  \ at a dreamlike scene: rows of flapping white fabric in a vast room of open windows.\
  \ Surely we\u2019ve stumbled on an art installation of some sort, an entry in the\
  \ Whitney Biennial perhaps, not the simple airing of tablecloth and napkin laundry\
  \ from the restaurant above, as we discover on closer inspection. We savor each\
  \ new surprise as it reveals itself: ornate curlicues on half-there banisters, grand\
  \ and graffitied arches, a bulky sculpture next to a rusted water tank on a landing.\
  \ On the top floor, we finally reach the restaurant, as startling in its elegance\
  \ and finished state as a pearl in an oyster. \n\nThe meal is satisfactory, the\
  \ surroundings attractive and relaxing, but the story is not about the establishment;\
  \ it is about the unveiling of it. Like Cuba itself, this place has sprung from\
  \ long neglect to newfound stardom, a fresh idea bursting from ruin, a color-splash\
  \ of vitality amid decay and disrepair. It\u2019s Communist-era living space turned\
  \ privately-owned paladar, and the old-new friction is raw. I feel protective, wanting\
  \ to keep parts of Cuba covered up, shielded from what is coming, preserved in its\
  \ imperfect, faded, messy splendor. But that\u2019s not my call, any more than it\
  \ is to want the opposite \u2013 for parts of this inefficient, maddening place\
  \ to get it together at times throughout my stay here. After a week, the country\
  \ is more of an enigma to me than it was before I arrived, both its treasures and\
  \ their shells the last things I expected to find."
