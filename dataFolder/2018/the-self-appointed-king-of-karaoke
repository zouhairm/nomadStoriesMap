Text: "I stand alone, holding a half drunken margarita in one hand, and a microphone\
  \ in the other. A cold rain splatters against my face, sending shivers down my spine.\
  \ Was that shiver caused by the brisk Berlin air or by my nerves finally acknowledging\
  \ that I\u2019m about to perform karaoke to a crowd of a thousand foreign faces?\
  \ I have yet to decide. \n\nNot knowing much about the German capital outside of\
  \ the usual tourist clich\xE9s, I\u2019d been urged by a colleague to visit Mauerpark\
  \ on a Sunday for an unforgettable experience: public karaoke. Held at 3pm in the\
  \ 'Bearpit', this public display of entertainment is managed by local icon Joe Hatchiban\
  \ who provides a portable karaoke system to willing participants to perform to crowds\
  \ in the thousands. I am shocked to see that on this day, even with the light shower\
  \ of rain, the small amphitheater is almost at max capacity.\n\nAfter painstakingly\
  \ finding a seat, I spot a man stumbling through the crowd selling jars of what\
  \ appears to be homemade margarita. Usually I wouldn\u2019t advocate day drinking,\
  \ but I know that without copious amounts of liquid courage, my vocal chords will\
  \ refuse to cooperate. So, I order three servings and down them in quick succession,\
  \ recoiling slightly more with every sip.\n\nAfter every performance, I wave my\
  \ hands like a madman attempting to signal to Joe that I was ready to bare my soul,\
  \ but time was running out. The rain began to intensify and I could sense that the\
  \ crowds were ready to disperse, until finally, our eyes met. I was summoned. Struggling\
  \ to push through the mass of bodies, I wonder if it is too early to crowd surf.\
  \ Definitely. Save for that after the performance. \n\nAfter introducing myself,\
  \ and crying out \u201CAussie, Aussie, Aussie\u201D to reinforce the stereotype\
  \ that Australians are nauseating tourists, I take the microphone and scroll down\
  \ to The Beatles on the portable karaoke system. I select my song of choice, and\
  \ the familiar sounds of \u201CTwist and Shout\u201D fill the arena. Nervous though\
  \ I was, I am instantly instilled with a Ferris Bueller-esque sense of confidence.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019ve rehearsed this moment a thousand times. Every late night Singstar\
  \ marathon, every drunken night out, every solo concert I\u2019ve performed in my\
  \ car. I have a carefully choreographed routine at this point. I even encourage\
  \ the audience to join in, and create a four-part harmony during the bridge. \n\
  I finish the song with a victorious fist in the sky, and a thunderous applause ensues.\
  \ The King of Karaoke has claimed his throne."
