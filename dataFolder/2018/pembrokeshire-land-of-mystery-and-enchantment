Text: "\u201CYou want to go to the start, is it?\u201D the robust bus driver asks\
  \ with a hint of mockery. \u201CYes!\u201D I proclaim grandly. He states \u201C\
  there\u2019s 86 kissing-gates along the Path mind you\u201D as if warning me to\
  \ avoid passing through with fellow walkers! In the name of being \u2018green\u2019\
  \ and despite the driver\u2019s jibes, I\u2019ve decided to pay the small fare and\
  \ board the Poppit Rocket in Cardigan. It\u2019s not, as one would assume, a rusty\
  \ fairground ride, but the 405 bus service that stretches the length of the rambling\
  \ Pembrokeshire coastline from St Dogmael\u2019s to Fishguard. \nI sit next to an\
  \ elderly walker who is spouting off loudly in Welsh to his black Lab. I see I\u2019\
  m not alone with my rucksack as I squash it next to several others, amongst hiking\
  \ boots and walking sticks. I plan to tolerate this journey to St Dogmael\u2019\
  s where I\u2019ll begin the most challenging section of the Path. Distracting myself,\
  \ I absorb the rugged cliff tops that surface outside as the bus navigates narrowly\
  \ around the coast.\nI\u2019ve chosen a potentially a good day for my walk to Newport\
  \ Parrog, but the smouldering clouds that peer from the horizon suggest otherwise.\
  \ As we meander along, I look back over to the sea where the cloud\u2019s reflections\
  \ have stained the surface like dark ink. The frequent steep hills that rise before\
  \ me do not bode well if the rain comes. Yet I suppose, west Wales in late spring\
  \ can be a gamble.\nHaving swiftly experienced the Abbey ruins that nestle within\
  \ the tranquil St Dogmael\u2019s, the wind ushers me to the official start/finish\
  \ plaque at Poppit carpark. In the distance, the Path undulates gently, so I am\
  \ prepared for the 15.5 miles set ahead of me. Onwards, I stay close to the Teifi\
  \ estuary that seeps down to the sands, blotting the reeds in the bordering marshland.\
  \ As the gateway for Cardigan Bay, the Bay is only just visible, with wetland plants\
  \ and woodland birds aplenty. \nHere the Blue Flag waves in the breeze. A good sign.\
  \ Because Poppit Sands is set in a cove, the wind howls deeply, encompassing and\
  \ agitating the straggly grass that sprouts sporadically in the dunes. I take the\
  \ quiet steep single track to get a better look over Cardigan Bay. The crash of\
  \ waves alert me to the rocks below. Looking down to the rock pools, the flooding\
  \ water leaves no mercy for stray barnacles and sea anemones that float limply to\
  \ the surface like remnants of disregarded washing up.  I need to decide which direction\
  \ to take from here. For now I reflect on the wild Welsh welcome I\u2019ve already\
  \ received."
