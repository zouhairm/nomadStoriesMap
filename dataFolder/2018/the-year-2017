Text: "The year 2017 was rife with pleasant surprises & decisions that were scary\
  \ in a good way. Like you would feel during a sky dive- it might be terrifying to\
  \ take that initial leap, but you know in your heart that if you do, it would be\
  \ one of the best experiences of your life. In 2016, I moved abroad for studies\
  \ to a country I never imagined myself living in - Germany. I was always fascinated\
  \ with traveling to different parts of the world, visiting places I\u2019ve only\
  \ read about in books, experiencing the cultural shift from one continent to another,\
  \ & also sharing my experiences on paper with the rest of the world.\nEurope & its\
  \ rich history has always captivated me. The reason I chose International Relations\
  \ for my Masters, was to learn more about the world. Living in Europe has not just\
  \ been interesting & beneficial for me academically, but personally as well. Visiting\
  \ countries ravaged by the WWII, the opportunity to go to the museums & locations\
  \ that has documented the horrors of the war - is an experience etched in my heart\
  \ forever. \nThe local connection I developed in Berlin was not just with its people\
  \ & places, but with the city itself. It is a different experience to read about\
  \ the wars & warlike conditions in books, but to actually walk down the streets\
  \ & visit places that were once bombed to the ground, is a whole different experience\
  \ altogether. Standing on the ground right where the Berlin Wall once stood, visiting\
  \ Checkpoint Charlie - the border where people once needed visas to cross over from\
  \ the Soviet sector to the American sector, standing on the ground of what was once\
  \ a concentration camp - where millions of people were murdered, serves a constant\
  \ reminder of the world we once lived in. The country which was once destroyed as\
  \ a result of fascism, today stands tall as one of the most multi-cultural countries\
  \ in Europe. I found Berlin, especially, one of the most vibrant & liberating cities\
  \ in Europe. I have visited around 20 places across the globe, but within 2 years,\
  \ I have connected with Berlin unlike anything before. I have shared some of the\
  \ most memorable moments on my travels with my dorm mates. While traveling together,\
  \ we found the cheapest trips (30-50 euros), lived in the cheapest hostels & backpacked\
  \ on foot across the town. In hindsight, these were some of the most amazing moments\
  \ of my life. The connection I developed with this city, is unlike any other experiences\
  \ I have ever had before."
