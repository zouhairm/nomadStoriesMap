Text: "The train leaves promptly in the afternoon, whisking us away to a far-off kingdom\
  \ amongst the imposing mountains. Steeped in rich tradition, this journey is made\
  \ by hundreds of thousands of Sri Lankans each year. We begin to climb up-country,\
  \ as a sheer rock face confines one side of the train, while gorgeous views of cascading\
  \ ravines and valleys can be seen from the other. After approximately three hours\
  \ the train arrives at its final destination: Kandy. \n\nI am here to experience\
  \ the Kandy Esala Perahera, one of the oldest and most awe-inspiring Buddhist festivals\
  \ in Sri Lanka. Perahera loosely translates to pageant, which comes from the Sanskrit\
  \ word \u2018parihara\u2019, a ritual that involves the parading and display of\
  \ sacred objects. \n\nSwarms of people spill onto the platform at the Kandy train\
  \ station, packed so tightly together that they resemble a powerful gush of water\
  \ headed downstream. We allow ourselves to be carried towards the main Perahera\
  \ route by the stream. Thousands of people line the footpath and many shopfronts,\
  \ trying to edge closer to the street to get a better view of the occasion.\n\n\
  We turn down the offer for seats worth 5,000 LKR and instead choose to stand on\
  \ a side street with locals. Although this is the third time that I have watched\
  \ Perahera, there is something distinctly different and new about this experience.\
  \ Perhaps it was the fact we were sitting with locals, who always seem willing to\
  \ lend a helping hand or have a friendly chat with strangers. Or perhaps it was\
  \ the beautiful young Sri Lankan girl adjacent to us, who was immaculately dressed\
  \ in a gorgeous pink outfit; her eyes reflecting feelings of genuine astonishment\
  \ and awe at seeing the festival for the first time. Perhaps it was the fact that\
  \ it wasn\u2019t the most comfortable or most pleasant way of viewing Perahera,\
  \ but it felt the most authentic.\n\nAs the procession-like service roams the streets,\
  \ the city comes to a complete standstill \u2014 if only for a brief period. It\u2019\
  s complicated and confusing, yet simple and direct. Nothing seems to matter except\
  \ for the beating of drums that ring out like waves throughout the city\u2019s thoroughfares\
  \ and alleyways; the decorative lights that adorn the graceful elephants dressed\
  \ in ornate and colorful costumes; the dancers that move in a rhythmic tandem; or\
  \ the Sacred Tooth Relic that sits in its throne atop the Maligawa Tusker. All the\
  \ while onlookers gaze on, seemingly entranced by the ritual unfolding in front\
  \ of them."
