Text: "From the outside, I'm content, from the inside my heart is beating faster than\
  \ normal. Not so much fear, instead rather the thrill of going where most would\
  \ avoid. My friend Yeison made a connection with a graffiti artist who welcomed\
  \ us to watch Brazil vs. Germany at his home. \nIn the coming hours, Brazil will\
  \ experience defeat that will go down in history forever. A night we'll remember\
  \ for the rest of our lives.\n\nI'm looking out the city bus window seeing the reflection\
  \ of my face through the glass. The sun is starting to fade away as the bus forces\
  \ to shift gears climbing up the hills of Sao Paolo. Into the heart of the favelas\
  \ we go.\n\nAs I step off the bus, I can feel the street life atmosphere hit my\
  \ body as were walking with Borgo to his flat. Kids in the streets are walking around\
  \ wearing their Brazil National team colors; yellow and blue scattered everywhere.\
  \ Flags hanging from the windows and outside all the shops we pass. The whole country\
  \ is filled with spirit and aspiration as their hours away from a rude awakening.\
  \ Little do they expect.\n\nBorgo, the graffiti artist we're staying with, explains\
  \ in Portuguese \"I'm not the biggest fan of f\xFAtbol, but when Brazil is playing,\
  \ I support 100%.\" We arrive at his flat and his walls are covered with an array\
  \ of colors from his friends who pick up a can, shake the marble inside, and spray\
  \ their name as a tag that represents... \"I was here.\"\n\nThe people of Brazil,\
  \ divided from their government, are united as a country to support their national\
  \ team in the 2014 FIFA World Cup as the host nation. In order to have a chance\
  \ at raising the trophy they must defeat the techincally sound German squad in the\
  \ semi-final.\n\nIn preparation for the match, steaks are being grilled in a charcoal\
  \ fire. Fresh lime and salt seasoning fill the smoke in the air. Samba music playing\
  \ in the background as friends from the favela are gathered around as the only plugin,\
  \ is currently being used for music. As the match is about to begin they unplug\
  \ the music and plug in the TV.\n \nEverything was going smooth, till Brazil finds\
  \ themselves losing 5-0 to Germany in the first 28' min of the match. By the 5th\
  \ goal, the TV was unplugged, and the speakers were back to playing music. The country\
  \ is shocked by the score. The match comes to an end, and kids are on the street\
  \ tearing down banners of Brazil and lighting them on fire. \n\nThe score finished\
  \ 7-1 to Germany, and I'm staying the night in the heart of the city as flames begin\
  \ to rise."
