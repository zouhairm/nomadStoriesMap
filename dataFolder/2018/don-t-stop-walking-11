Text: "The lights jolt you awake with all the tenderness and patience of a cattle\
  \ prod. I blink slowly until I can bear the brightness as three elderly men wearing\
  \ backpacks rush by; one of them has a large clam shell hanging off his pack.  \n\
  The room is filled with the zipping and unzipping of bags and jackets while people\
  \ stage whisper: \u201CI\u2019ll meet you downstairs.  No, wait, I\u2019m going\
  \ to whisper my entire life story, here, right in front of the people trying to\
  \ sleep. \u201D \nOthers are scurrying around looking for their belongings with\
  \ squinted eyes and ruffled hair.   \n\u201CWhat time is it?\u201D I ask Beth who\
  \ has brushed locks and a packed bag.  \n\u201C6.30,\u201D she answers, rolling\
  \ up her sleeping bag.        \n\u201CI\u2019m sleeping 15 more minutes.\u201D I\
  \ squash my pillow over my face.   \n\u201CWe have to be out of here in half an\
  \ hour.\u201D  \n\u201CWhat? Why?\u201D  \n\u201CThose are the rules.\" Her pupils\
  \ pause on mine and I\u2019m rudely reminded that this former monastery is run by\
  \ off-duty nuns and everything makes outrageous sense.   \nI slide my sore muscles\
  \ over to the bunk ladder and my hamstrings squeal with each step down.  \n\nYellow\
  \ Iodine floods into the tender pink flesh of my blister and I clench my teeth as\
  \ the sting rings through my skin. \nI look out the third story window and find\
  \ the black night curtain has lifted to reveal a grey, rainy day and a stone sinks\
  \ into the pit of my stomach. I have not prepared for rain. I have not prepared\
  \ for any of this. \nI tie back my hair, flick my hood over my head and pull the\
  \ drawstring tight. \n\nWe reluctantly make our way out of the large building, rain\
  \ hammering down and the morning now springing an elegant blue-grey line across\
  \ the horizon. The trail of pilgrims ahead of us make quick steps through the pinching\
  \ cold.  \nCow bells ding as the large animals are led along our track and we begin\
  \ to step in time to their sound.  It\u2019s been such a long time since I have\
  \ seen one of these beasts in one piece. I forgot they live before they die.\nI\
  \ put my hand on one of the soft warm hides, beathing in the wet grass, disrupted\
  \ soil and I feel my tired skin alive with the exhale. \nA road sign in the shape\
  \ of an arrow reads: \u201CSantiago \u2013 820kms.\u201D  \nMy blister begins to\
  \ burn when I notice a flash of something red obscured by the branches of a tree.\
  \ \nI take a step in closer - an old school stop sign covered in graffiti leers\
  \ out from the leaves.  \n\"Don\u2019t\" scribbled boldly above the \"STOP\" and\
  \ \"walking\" underlined below it."
