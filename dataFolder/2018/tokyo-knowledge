Text: "It was dark out by the time I got off the Ginza subway.  The walk back to my\
  \ hostel was especially frosty as the autumn wind stung my face, but I wasn\u2019\
  t ready for the night to conclude, so I casually wandered around the streets of\
  \ Asakusa until a discreet sign for a bar caught my eye.    \n\n\"Tokyo Knowledge-Tourist\
  \ Friendly!\"  \n\nNormally, I would avoid a place catering to tourists while traveling,\
  \ but there was something particularly inviting about an unassuming sign sitting\
  \ in front of a concealed stairwell.    \n     \nWhen I walked in, there were two\
  \ young guys sitting at the tiny bar, drinking & laughing.  They seemed to be genuinely\
  \ startled by the sudden appearance of an American girl.  But I was comfortable.\
  \  Knowledge was the size of a small living room with scattered d\xE9cor consisting\
  \ mostly of custom skateboards & edgy street art.  Rap music played in the background\
  \ while a Mission Impossible film was silently projected onto an empty wall.\n \
  \ \n\u201CWhat brings you here?\u201D Akira asked me in perfect English.\n\nI sat\
  \ down and we launched into conversation, switching between English and Japanese\
  \ while consuming an endless amount of whiskey.  \n\nOver several hours, more regulars\
  \ came through the door and it became apparent that they were all close friends\
  \ who hung out at this bar every night like they were in a 90\u2019s sitcom.  To\
  \ them, I was both a celebrity and a familiar friend who instantly earned the nickname,\
  \ \u201CKawaii-chan\u201D.  \n  \nSo, I went back.  Every single night.  After a\
  \ week we all seemed to forget that I wasn\u2019t actually a regular.  Akira and\
  \ I would flirtatiously joke about me becoming his mail-order bride so I\u2019d\
  \ never have to leave Tokyo behind.       \n\nEven though they welcomed rowdy western\
  \ tourists with open arms, most of the foreigners who came in were ex-pats.  They\
  \ were always eager to get drunk & loudly slur in broken Japanese about their anime\
  \ obsession or fetish for Asian women, despite the clear discomfort of the demure,\
  \ local girls forced to listen.     \n\nThe night Akira kicked some of them out\
  \ by \u201Cshutting down\u201D early, I realized I had truly been accepted.  \n\n\
  \u201CStay.\u201D His voice rang like a command, but a gentle one.  \n\nBefore I\
  \ could reply, he had picked my bag off a bar stool and placed it into a wall cubby\
  \ as a silent gesture.  I didn\u2019t need to be convinced though.  \n   \nWe stayed\
  \ for a few more hours until he had to lock up his bar.  Then we paraded down the\
  \ street, letting our laughter fill the emptiness as the sun began to rise."
