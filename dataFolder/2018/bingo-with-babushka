Text: "It was day four of my weeklong Saratov project, working with Russian teenagers\
  \ to rehearse and perform a musical in English. But there had been a miscalculation.\
  \ \n\n\u2018It is ok, I invited grandmother.\u2019 My host Anya reassured me as\
  \ she teetered towards the flat\u2019s large iron door. We were in a \u2018Khrushcyovka\u2019\
  , a standard communist-era concrete block. The flat had a living room, bathroom\
  \ and kitchen, and Anya had relinquished the sofa for me, with her sleeping in the\
  \ kitchen. She was happy to make this concession, and beamed with pride to her colleagues\
  \ that she could accommodate the school\u2019s English visitor in a flat all of\
  \ her own. However, missing a night with Mr right? No way. Anya switched on the\
  \ TV, threw me a smile and locked the door behind her.\n\nLost in a babble of Russian-dubbed\
  \ Pretty Woman, I jumped at hearing the key in the lock. Behind the door stood a\
  \ frown, barely visible under layers of woollen armour against the December snow.\
  \ I offered my hand, but it was swatted away as she removed her outdoor shoes.\n\
  \nUnwrapped and defrosted, Babushka barked instructions at me. I, bewildered, followed\
  \ her to the kitchen where she set up at the tiny table, arranging the contents\
  \ of a small bag - several bingo boards and one hundred tiny wooden barrels. The\
  \ set was clearly well used and well loved. Another soviet-era relic. She returned\
  \ all the barrels to their functional linen home and gestured at me, shaking the\
  \ bag. I reached in and pulled out a rough barrel, about a centimetre long, with\
  \ the number 2 burned on its base. \n\n\u2018Two?\u2019 I offered.\n\n\u2018Nyet!\
  \ Dvar.\u2019 She grunted. Not satisfied until I repeated the word with precision,\
  \ she eventually accepted my attempt. We checked our boards and she placed the barrel\
  \ over the number 2 on my board. I nudged the bag towards her. She nudged it back.\
  \ Silence. Apparently I was calling out all the numbers. In Russian. She refused\
  \ to tell me the numbers before I\u2019d at least made a stab at what it might be!\
  \ We only moved on once my pronunciation was satisfactory.\n\nShe didn\u2019t speak\
  \ a breath of English, and my Russian didn\u2019t extend beyond awkwardly thanking\
  \ her and telling her I was full. And yet, we passed the evening laughing and sharing\
  \ our ideas, thoughts and dreams. Instead of a language barrier, we found a communication\
  \ opportunity, and used every jot of mime, expression and body language at our disposal.\
  \ \n\nThe evening didn't just teach me the numbers 1-100 in Russian. It affirmed\
  \ my belief in a shared, universal humanity."
