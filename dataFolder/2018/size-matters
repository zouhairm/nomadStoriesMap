Text: "Kruger was scorched; trees stripped and splintered by starving elephants. Heavy\
  \ with the stink of dust and diesel. We\u2019d skipped the crowded south, where\
  \ day visitors watched lions through their iPhones, and drove North, to the warm\
  \ comradery of locals flagging us down to share their luck.\n\nLuck. The magic ingredient.\
  \  \n\nOf the \u201Cbrochure\u201D safari species, the giraffe\u2019s ridiculous\
  \ proportions, blunt tufted horns - the ossicones - and comically bland expression\
  \ should make it the joke of the bush. But this is an elegant animal; herbivorous,\
  \ deliberate, with a hypnotic lolloping grace. They are common in Kruger, too numerous\
  \ to stop for every group, but there was something about the way these two bulls\
  \ were facing off that made us slow. After a pause, 6 foot of muscular neck was\
  \ swung like a golf club, thundering into the other with such momentum his knees\
  \ buckled. \n\nIn battle, the giraffe is a different animal. Size matters, and a\
  \ few casual blows often decide the contest, but the smaller of our bulls was persistent\
  \ and the pair traded several punishing strikes. The crack of bone-on-bone shattering\
  \ the bush. The larger bull swung, striking it\u2019s opponents legs and jarred,\
  \ it\u2019s ossicones caught below his rivals knee. He was stuck. Contorted, twisted\
  \ and stuck. \n\nThe smaller bull braced, hooves planted firmly, then swung into\
  \ the body of his opponent. Again and again. The large bull bucked and yanked, his\
  \ neck rippling as his tried to free himself but he was helpless, his weapon tethered\
  \ and weakening with every blow. His knees crumbled, his neck folded. Was it broken?\
  \ Another shattering crack and 600kg of defeated muscle slumped into the dry grass.\n\
  \n\u201CIs it dead?\u201D I breathed, unable to look away. \n\nThe victor took a\
  \ few laboured steps, limping forward, the body dragging weightily behind. Another\
  \ step, a kick, and his leg was free. The head thumped limply to the ground. \n\n\
  \u201CHe\u2019s still breathing\u201D whispered Matthew, \u201CJust\u201D. \n\n\
  I watched his chest rise, slow and shallow, as the minutes dragged by. \n\n\u201C\
  This is awful. We\u2019re watching him die\u201D\n\nThen, in a burst of movement,\
  \ he was on his feet. Not dead, but defeated.  \n\nBeneath the leaf litter, besides\
  \ the parched streams, high in the trees, every creature was living out its own\
  \ drama, in a vast patchwork of beauty and brutality. A false step or unlucky moment\
  \ for one, another day alive for another. As one giraffe limped away alive, another\
  \ won the right to mate. \n\nPerhaps this time, we had all struck a little lucky."
