Text: "We idled at the intersection, waiting to enter the stream of congested chaos.\
  \ Across from our Renault rental, a carriage-toting donkey inched forward into the\
  \ traffic. A bus barreled by\_clipping his\_face, knocking him back.\n\n\u201CWe\u2019\
  re gonna die!\u201D quipped my travel companion. That was her tension-breaking joke\
  \ for every hint of danger\_on our five-week European trek. But this was Morocco,\
  \ where livestock had just been assaulted by the public transport. The joke was\
  \ now a very real possibility.\n\nWhy had I let her talk me into this? I\u2019m\
  \ a planner, and she had us ticking every box for irresponsible traveling.\_Our\
  \ ferry arrived\_at midnight. The pier in Tangier was miles from any hotel. Having\
  \ not exchanged Euros for Dirhams, we hopped a free shuttle with no idea where it\
  \ might drop us. Had we done research, we might have known we\u2019d be bombarded\
  \ by drug dealers at our destination. Perhaps nothing was worse than neglecting\
  \ to tell family and friends where we were going, and now our only connection home,\
  \ my Blackberry,\_had no reception.\n\nA night train to Marrakech had us feeling\
  \ safe among tourists again. Browsing leather walls and spice hills in the Medina,\
  \ she was a master haggler. I had somehow negotiated a higher price for a shirt.\
  \ When she insisted we find a camel to ride, we detoured off the beaten path once\
  \ more. I agreed to drive us to the coast using a compass and roadmap as a guide.\
  \ Agadir had no camels but plenty of pickpockets. They only stole a DV tape from\
  \ me so it was\_a cheaper,\_less stressful endeavor than my haggling.\n\nThree days\
  \ we spent committing traffic offenses across Morocco, scouring for that most common\
  \ tourist attraction. Our last night, as we slept in our hatchback parked outside\
  \ a shopping center, police woke me to move our car. It was two in the morning as\
  \ I drove on empty looking for a safe street to park. She woke once to tell me to\
  \ look for a better spot but passed out again.\_There was nowhere else to go. I\
  \ would have to keep watch. All night I craned my neck at every ominous sound from\
  \ the darkness, until dawn.\n\nI learned a lot about myself on that trip. I learned\
  \ how to watch over someone. I learned the value of dabbling in the unplanned. It\
  \ forces you to be more present in the moment. You get a whole new perspective of\
  \ the country. At the very least, you come away with a story. After returning the\
  \ car, we went to catch a ferry. Along the way, I spotted a camel on the beach.\
  \ The owner overcharged for rides. I let her do the haggling."
