Text: "In Costa Rica\u2019s Nicoya Gulf, a few dozen kilometers off the coast of P\xE1\
  jaros, the fishermen of Isla Chira are just beginning to pull their old boats in\
  \ to the mangrove-speckled beaches on the Palito shore. Night is descending; a storm\
  \ is coming in. The low rumble of a motorcycle breaks the silence of the cool waves\
  \ lapping on the beach, and soon all the men are gone, but two. \n Gabriel Cruz\
  \ is preparing his boat to ride out into the storm with another man. They will spend\
  \ the next twelve hours on patrol for poachers, moving up and down the clock of\
  \ night and listening eternally for the casting of a net; enforcing the laws of\
  \ the protected waters. They tell me this storm won\u2019t be enough to stop the\
  \ poachers, so they must honor their agreement. I ask the men the most difficult\
  \ part of this responsibility, and they both reply, without any hesitation, \u201C\
  the loneliness.\u201D\n Years ago, over-fishing in the Gulf drove the fishermen\
  \ to establish regulations for themselves\u2014 they banned trawling nets and committed\
  \ to using small size seven hooks to avoid juvenile fish. \u201CBut,\u201D Gabriel\
  \ says, \u201Cthere are always people who don\u2019t go by the rules.\u201D\n Now\
  \ Gabriel is bringing the gas can down to the water\u2019s edge, where his boat\
  \ sits tilted in the mud waiting for the tide and for the veil of night to fall.\
  \ I will go out with him tonight to comb the bruisey darkness for the lights of\
  \ poachers, to listen for the spray of water from the casting of a net. We will\
  \ drive the line between the buoys of the past and I will lose the count of hours,\
  \ until he lets the engine die and runs his boat aground onto a sandbar in the middle\
  \ of the Gulf, the spine of a submerged and unseen creature. The fisherman will\
  \ leave the boat and I will follow him, not knowing where he is going, where I am\
  \ going, where we will end up. Then he will point down at the water moving at his\
  \ feet, and I will see the sparks of bioluminescence glinting in the surf\u2014\
  \ thousands of microscopic glowing creatures filling the water with the light of\
  \ existence, and I will understand why the men agree to spend these long nights\
  \ patrolling in the cold; what they are protecting; what they have to lose. These\
  \ fireworks will go on bursting in the cool swells of the ocean long after we have\
  \ gone, and that night we will find no poachers, but in a few hours the sun will\
  \ rise and the fishermen will take their boats out once again, and the air will\
  \ fill with the sound of many hooks\u2014size seven\u2014 hitting the water as they\
  \ cast their lines."
