Text: "I worked with a company that sells fine art on-board cruise ships and employs\
  \ people from all over the world and I am talkin' I am hanging out with an ah-BUNDANCE\
  \ of South Africans, people from Poland, Mexico, Serbia, Ukraine, and many many\
  \ more. The training that I attended ended and out of the 80 people at training\
  \ in Miami, Florida, there were only five of us left before we went onto our ships.\n\
  And where did the handful of people from around the world want to go to?\nDISNEYWORLD.\n\
  Throughout the day, I watched moms and dads get frustrated with their children for\
  \ jumping on booth seats around lunchtime when they should've been eating, Disney\
  \ workers giving out free stickers to little kids, and families looking longingly\
  \ at those who signed up for the FastPass \"cut the hour-long-line\" walking right\
  \ past them (it's FREE y'all - get to those FastPass stations in the morning and\
  \ sign up for the good rides before they're taken).\nAll in all, it was an excellent\
  \ day.\nAt 9:00pm, Disney puts on this show where everyone in the whole park stands\
  \ on the walkway leading up to the Castle and the Castle itself lights up with different\
  \ colors and holograms of Disney characters while songs like \"How Far I'll Go\"\
  \ from the Moana soundtrack or \"Friend Like Me\" in Aladdin played over the loud\
  \ speakers. It wasn't until one of the boys decided we should get going that I went\
  \ and found the other girl in our group from Russia -\n\"C'mon we gotta get going\
  \ girl\"\nShe turned to me and with a calm voice (as though she was confiding in\
  \ me) said \"...this may be the only time I will ever see this in my life. I just\
  \ want to stay a little bit longer.\"\nAnd with that, it brought me right to the\
  \ present. That very second of standing there watching fireworks and holograms at\
  \ Disneyworld listening to songs I grew up on with thousands of other adults and\
  \ children enjoying that exact same moment in so many different ways that I would\
  \ never have been a part of it I didn't decide to go to Orlando, FL that day with\
  \ a girl from Russia, a boy from England, and a boy from South Africa. I cannot\
  \ begin to tell you how infinite my heart felt at that very second.\n\"Ooo look\
  \ a big one!\" She exclaimed like a child pointing at one of the fireworks that\
  \ just went off. I smiled, put my head on her shoulder, and listened to \"You'll\
  \ Be In My Heart\" from Tarzan serenading me into the nostalgic trance only Disneyworld\
  \ could have organized and maintained for over 46 years.\n \nNow that Ladies and\
  \ Gentlemen - is Walt Disney magic."
