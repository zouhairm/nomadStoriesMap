Text: "It all started with a visa for Canada. \nSeems common enough, being Australian\
  \ where visa approvals are made in about the same time as a cup of coffee. My flights\
  \ were booked and I was ready to leave, quietly knowing that I wouldn't be coming\
  \ home again. This was sometime around July 2016, when I was at the pinnacle of\
  \ what society would call the successful makings of a prosperous future - a long\
  \ term partner, a well paying job that I loved and could grow in, and a social network\
  \ that took years to solidify. \nWhy would I leave?\nIf I told you it was to find\
  \ myself, I wouldn't know what that meant? \nIf I said it was to explore this world,\
  \ that would be closer to the truth.\nBut if I said nothing more than, \"I had to\
  \ go\", how would that make you feel?\nTwo months before I planned to leave, a Facebook\
  \ post comes up on my feed: \"looking for some friends to come hike the Mardi Himal,\
  \ in Nepal...  hike starts on the first of Oct...\"\n\nIf all you had to drive your\
  \ travel plans was nothing more than a feeling in your gut, that said, \"go\", then\
  \ it's not so surprising to find yourself in the middle of Kathmandu, eight months\
  \ later, with a dog you found on a roof in Pokhara, and a photo album in your mind\
  \ that stetched from the harsh, barren reaches of the Upper Mustang border to the\
  \ endless rice fields, flowering in the rich valleys of lower Langtang. \n\nBut\
  \ let's not forget that visa. \nMy time to enter Canadian soil was beginning to\
  \ slip away, and so was my travel funds. I had to make a choice. But this time,\
  \ my gut had no opinion. \nI had a new family now, I had a new life, but my future\
  \ was uncertain. Do I stay in Nepal and risk running out of money, and forget about\
  \ ever entering Canada, but knowing I will be happy? Or do I leave, and take those\
  \ first formidable steps into a brand new adventure?\n\nFebruary 2018. The temperatures\
  \ have reached minus 17. Diesal begins turning to gel at minus six. The roof of\
  \ my camper is caving from the weight of the snow, and my mattress has frozen after\
  \ having been damp for the last two weeks. So, what does that mean?\nIt means that\
  \ in less than a year, my now travel dog and me have driven over 5000km across Canada,\
  \ we've seen 14 out of the 50 states in the US, and have found a home in everything\
  \ from a corn shed, to a tree, to a beat up old truck.\nIt means that the day I\
  \ said \"goodbye\" to everything I once held dear in Australia, I said \"hello\"\
  \ to the one life I never knew, I always wanted."
