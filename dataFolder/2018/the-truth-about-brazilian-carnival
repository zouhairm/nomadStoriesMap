Text: "There's no need an intense search in google to find a fact: Foreigners have\
  \ a completely stereotyped view of the Brazilian Carnival. A party that lasts 12\
  \ months a year, huge and luxurious parades and naked women is what usually a tourist\
  \ expects to land in Brazil. The truth is that this important date of the country\
  \ can offer much more to the visitors. With the approach of February, Brazilian\
  \ cities start to become in a plurality celebration scene where the cultural and\
  \ popular appeal are the leading role.\nI'm a person who doesn't really like to\
  \ party, but this year I surrender to the \"bloquinhos\", as are known the parties\
  \ that dominate the streets of the country and are the favorite spectacle of the\
  \ population, and the experience couldn't been better. My first perception is there's\
  \ a unique energy in the songs that are played, there's a contagious pride feeling\
  \ of the Brazilian culture, seems like everyone's singing and dancing the national\
  \ anthem. In the city that I live, Belo Horizonte, Ax\xE9 predominates in the set\
  \ lists, however, in each part of the country there's a musical genre that's preferred\
  \ by the population: Frevo, Maracatu, Samba and Marchinha.\nThe music is a reflection\
  \ of the representativeness that Carnival brings, of the five genres mentioned,\
  \ four have an African origin, and this happens in a country where the white elite\
  \ tries to make the black community invisible. It's remarkable how during the holiday\
  \ the speeches in favor of humanitarian causes comes to light, and the bloquinhos\
  \ are the diversity platform. I believe that a great part of the happiness I've\
  \ experienced is attributed to the freedom to be who I am.\nAlthough the substantial\
  \ and critical political discourse that the Carnival raises, everything's approached\
  \ in a lighter and joy way. The multiplicity of colors, the glitter, the fantasies\
  \ of Brazilian memes, it's incredible how these people know to throw a party. I\
  \ exhaled to fantasize, but when I realize I was dancing \"Mel\xF4 do Tchan\" in\
  \ my pizza belovesie, another wise decision. A few dozens people came to talk to\
  \ me, it was a perfect time to make connections, make exchanges. I believe there's\
  \ no other time when this interaction occurs more uncomplicatedly.\nIn the end,\
  \ this cultural immersion was extremely constructive for me. All that I carry with\
  \ me was a fullness heart, cultural knowledge and a sorry feeling  for those who\
  \ believe that Carnival its butts and drinks and miss the opportunity to experience\
  \ the joy of people."
