Text: "My skin is coated in a layer of dirty sweat. I feel a new bead form at the\
  \ nape of my neck, where a few small hairs have escaped from my ponytail, as it\
  \ begins it\u2019s own adventure sliding down my spine to it\u2019s final resting\
  \ place in a pool that\u2019s forming on top of my shorts. I smile.  \n\nIn contrast\
  \ to the rest of my body, my feet are dry. I can feel my soles scrape along the\
  \ concrete floor of a Muay Thai training center in Trang, Thailand. I kick up so\
  \ my right foot makes contact with the punching bag swaying in front of me. I\u2019\
  m commanded, \u201CAgain!\u201D in a language I don\u2019t speak. \n\nI\u2019m twenty-three\
  \ and have been in the country for a week. My Thai vocabulary doesn\u2019t extend\
  \ beyond khob khun kha (thank you) and the requisite sawadee-ka (a greeting). I\
  \ am here as a volunteer English teacher at a rural high school. I\u2019ll come\
  \ to learn that while my time with the students is meaningful, the biggest connections\
  \ I\u2019ll make are with the local teachers. Unexpected friendships will be formed\
  \ with individuals who on paper live opposite lives from mine back in California.\
  \ I can connect more with an old rural Thai man than than I do with some of my neighbors\
  \ back in Santa Monica. \n\nAgain!\n\nMy body is tired and muscles I didn\u2019\
  t know I have ache.\n\nAgain!\n\nThe air is thick with humidity. Each inhalation\
  \ fills my lungs with a sweet blend of tropical plants, the promise of rain, and\
  \ a hint of mango.\n\nThe program I\u2019m with has an in-country director, Khem,\
  \ who offered to take some of us to boxing lessons as an introduction to an aspect\
  \ of Thai culture we wouldn\u2019t otherwise see.\n\nThe head of the gym has taken\
  \ a liking to me. He\u2019s short, leathery, and anywhere from forty-five to, I\
  \ don\u2019t know, seventy-years-old. It\u2019s hard to tell if his skin is weathered\
  \ from a lifetime of sun or youthful from the joy that radiates out of his eyes.\
  \ His English is as bad as my Thai, but Khem is there to translate. Truthfully,\
  \ though, we are communicating outside of language constraints. It\u2019s a human\
  \ connection, told through facial expressions. He teases me that I should move to\
  \ Trang for training, that he could turn me into a champion. I consider his offer\
  \ for a moment.\n\nI hold this experience dear nearly a decade later, though it\
  \ is not unique to my time in Thailand. Connections will be formed over good-natured\
  \ laughs about how I eat with a fork instead of the customary spoon and via furrowed\
  \ brows that turn into grins as I fumble through speaking a new language.\n\nAgain!"
