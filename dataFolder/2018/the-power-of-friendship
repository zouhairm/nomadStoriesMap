Text: I live in Saskatchewan and have attended different schools with my friends as
  the years went by and each of us got older. Not one of us knew each other before
  we started our first day of school. Some us grew up in different countries before
  we came here. There were some ups and downs as the years went by but we managed
  to get through the years. All of us were brought together by simply each of us introducing
  each other to one another. We grew up loving different things and meeting a lot
  new people as we attended school. My weekend I went to a party. I was so excited
  to attend my first birthday party. Well time went by and my cousin and I grew to
  be young adults. We attended the same schools since the day we met and found out
  we were cousins. I remember back in third grade I met a guy named Breyden Bloor.
  We would talk and laugh about things each day. That same year I started to like
  him. He hadn't found out because I didn't want him to know yet. We got into junior
  high and through 7th grade he liked to tease me and bug me which I didn't have a
  problem with. We grew being friends since third grade. Well I finally hit 12th grade
  and was able to see him again after him being gone for two years. I was so excited
  to see him. Well later in November we had some issues. He needed time to think about
  it so that's what I'm giving him. He is the one person I will cherish and miss for
  the rest of my life.
