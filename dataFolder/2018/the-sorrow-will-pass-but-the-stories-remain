Text: "A woman was cooking in the kitchen, did not even have time to wipe off the\
  \ beads of sweat on her forehead. Though it was a tough time, lives were still going\
  \ on. The war was too terrified to give up but stimulate the desire to survive;\
  \ due to this, she and her husband\u2019s hotel and restaurant accommodated and\
  \ fed lots of residents here. While boiling the potatoes, she suddenly heard the\
  \ air raid siren. Panic quickly spread out through screaming and fleeing crowds.\
  \ She knew the threat was real\u2014the bombs were coming again.\n\nIt was a total\
  \ ruin, which the scene he could hardly bear. Everything had been destroyed by tens\
  \ of thousands of bombs from several days before\u2014the most severe attack yet.\
  \ Debris and ashes were everywhere, converting the original appearance to just a\
  \ recent memory. As this young soldier reconnoitered his beloved but fragmented\
  \ hometown, he surprisingly discovered a building still standing. Walking closer,\
  \ he recognized it as the restaurant he frequented as a kid.\n\nSitting in the hotel\
  \ in which I stayed for two nights, I was stunned by these stories. Peter, the narrator\
  \ and the successor of this centenary hotel, indicated that these traumatic histories\
  \ had happened during the Second World War to his grandmother and to one of his\
  \ customers years ago. What he did not know was that his tales changed my view of\
  \ Augsburg tremendously. After two-day sightseeing, I regarded here as a prosaic\
  \ city. It had all kinds of restaurants, churches, and tram that I had seen elsewhere.\
  \ However, Peter\u2019s stories provided a deeper and obscure aspect of Augsburg,\
  \ which was also more impressive and profound.\n\nI walked out the lobby, headed\
  \ to the train station, and strolled along the way I came. The autumn leaves were\
  \ still dancing and whirling in the gentle breeze like the day I arrived; the bakery\
  \ was full of queuing customers as usual. But Augsburg was no longer a typical Germen\
  \ city to me.  Some trifles from corner to corner made it distinct. Unlike other\
  \ European city centers, the ancient atmosphere could be hardly sensed here owing\
  \ to the devastation and the reconstruction. Suddenly, I recalled some of the war\
  \ stories my grandmother had told. Peter passed down the history as my grandmother\
  \ did; it would be my turn to do so someday. It is miraculous that unanticipated\
  \ coincidences occasionally bring the indiscernible vestige of the history vividly.\
  \ I cautiously wrapped and tucked a piece of Augsburg into my journal, leaving with\
  \ appreciation and satisfaction."
