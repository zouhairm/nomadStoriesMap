Text: "\u201CIf I want a tiny cup of espresso,\u201D said the tour guide with her\
  \ Croatian accent, \u201Cand I only have 45 minutes to spare, it simply isn\u2019\
  t enough time. I need at least an hour.\u201D She pointed to the busy caf\xE9s and\
  \ terraces that flowed down the cobblestone street, \u201CSee! this is how we drink\
  \ coffee in Zagreb.\u201D\n\nIt is my last evening in the city-centre and decide\
  \ to test her claim.\n\nThe air is cool as I walk along the aging streetscape and\
  \ I step into a nearby caf\xE9. The modern interior walls are painted white and\
  \ a library of books covers the long length of a side wall. Low rise sofas in primary\
  \ colours occupy the front space and small tables with black leather chairs fill\
  \ the rear. Some people are chatting on the sofas while others are quietly reading.\n\
  \nNear the library I find a seat and the server tends to me. He nods at my order\
  \ for \u201Cone espresso\u201D and brings a demitasse along with a glass of water.\
  \ He smiles then returns to the counter.\n\nI let the aroma rise from the strong\
  \ brew and with a tiny spoon, I taste the bittersweet crema. \u201CPace yourself,\u201D\
  \ I thought, looking at the tiny cup, \u201Cthis has to last an hour.\u201D\n\n\
  My attention turns to the books and I peruse the foreign text along the bindings\
  \ for any recognisable word to give me a hint of its contents, but no success. \n\
  \nA tall, young man casually dressed in a T-shirt and jeans sits at the sofa next\
  \ to my table and he opens an old leather bound book with pages that fold out like\
  \ map plates. I am curious about the historical volume and I ask the man, \u201C\
  Excuse me, do you speak English?\u201D He exclaims, \u201CYes!\u201D and introduces\
  \ himself. Moreno, a university student majoring in linguistics, is excited at the\
  \ opportunity to practice his English. \n\nHe shows me the book, and while we browse\
  \ the pages, we share stories about our respective countries. He teaches me some\
  \ Croatian words while I help with his English. We reminisce about our past travels,\
  \ mine through North America and his through Europe. We debate politics and we discuss\
  \ history. We talk about coffee. And we talk about life. All the while, we sip on\
  \ our espresso.\n\nThe evening passes so quickly, before we know it, it has been\
  \ over three hours! Moreno, then searching for his words, says, \u201CWe are of\
  \ two same souls, spirits. We shall meet again!\u201D I look at him puzzled, and\
  \ he repeats, \u201Csomewhere we shall meet again.\u201D And we say good bye.\n\n\
  I leave the caf\xE9 into the crisp night air and the city\u2019s ambiance that holds\
  \ coffee to its heart keeps me warm as I stroll along."
