Text: "The sea rustled, the leaves moved in the slight wind and the hammock swung\
  \ gentle. Pancho Villa was the perfect place to simply dangle the soul. In the evenings,\
  \ the smell of freshly grilled Mexican specialties was in the air, I drank Pulque\
  \ (a national Mexican drink) at the bar, meet the locals and if I was luckily there\
  \ was live Mexican music to top it all off.\n\nAn open kitchen is the place where\
  \ everybody meet who want to prepare meals. The fireplace invited you to cook -\
  \ provided you have collected enough wood in the forest in advance. At the same\
  \ time, it also offered warmth for the cooler evening hours in February. At a large\
  \ table the international travelers sit together. The exchange of the different\
  \ dishes is a journey through the world's kitchens and created lots of ideas for\
  \ new recipes.\n\nFollowing the small path out of the forest, I stood next to the\
  \ Caribbean Sea. There were already more tourists getting lost here than at the\
  \ camp, but compared to the tourist hot spots in Yucat\xE1n or also Tulum, it was\
  \ also much quieter, especially in the morning or evening. Laying in the white sandy\
  \ beach and relaxing, dreaming or doing some Yoga, it just felt like a paradise.\n\
  \nFor other activities, for example visiting the city, historical places or snorkeling\
  \ in one of the cenotes it is necessary to take one of the typical share taxis,\
  \ called colectivo. In the more touristic areas colectivos are used from tourists\
  \ and locals. In other parts of Mexico it can happen that you are the only European\
  \ in the middle of Mexicans which was an interesting experience, too. To get in\
  \ the city takes 20 minutes \u2013 so it is easy to enjoy a day out of the camp\
  \ and easily return in the evening.\n\nRather than just passing through, I ended\
  \ up spending four nights in this magical place. Without Wi-Fi, after travelling\
  \ through a lot of places, I was able to look back on my impressions and come to\
  \ rest. Getting together with the locals and talking about the country and life\
  \ of the people in Mexico was exciting and gave me additional inspiration and new\
  \ energy for my own life and onward journey. \n\nPancho Villa - The Camp Revolution\
  \ is located next to the Caribbean Sea and is nestled in a small forest of palm\
  \ trees. It is possible to build up your own tent, rent one or to sleep in a small\
  \ wooden house. Just ten minutes\u2019 walk from the popular ruins, I escaped the\
  \ mass tourism and enjoyed Mexican serenity. One of my perfect places in Mexico\
  \ and the last thing I expected there."
