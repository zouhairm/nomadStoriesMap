Text: "A 20-year-old girl and an Opel Astra. Two weeks driving miles and miles in\
  \ the midst of summer through unknown nature, from Germany up to Lake Garda, inhaling\
  \ raw, unfiltered experiences. Literally all I packed was a small blue tent, some\
  \ food and kind of a wild, slightly naive heart. \nAs I reached Meran, a city in\
  \ the north of Italy, I had already seen a lot of beauty, dark-green shaded forests\
  \ and clear, turquoise rivers, I had driven mountain passes with endless wiggling\
  \ driveways and romantic valleys, where dark wooden cabins were snuggling against\
  \ cliffy wall rocks. \nThe campsite outside the city among apple groves was gorgeous,\
  \ but I was completely wiped out. I had already realized taking a trip like this\
  \ alone is stunning in its own way and challenging in many different ways. Driving\
  \ for hours. Permanent Heat. Coordinating while being a complete coordination-deadbeat.\
  \ Handling loneliness at the fledgling stage. What put me over the edge was taking\
  \ painkillers the past nights because an ear piercing I got two months ago had inflamed.\n\
  I was just happy to have my tent finally built up and to enjoy some leftovers from\
  \ a burrito wrap, when three tall, not amused looking men walked my way. Accidentally\
  \ I had settled at their booked spot. This alone wouldn\u2018t have been that bad,\
  \ but paired with the demand to clear their space immediatly and my already battered\
  \ body and mind, I started crying out of nowhere.\nThey were as overtaken by this\
  \ reaction as I was myself. This was the moment when two elderly women, who had\
  \ obviously observed the whole situation, came over, glaring at the men like lion-mothers.\
  \ Martha, one of the women, hugged me gently telling me I reminded her of her own\
  \ daughter Ellie. This simple act of kindness made me calming down, it was much\
  \ needed after this week of solitude. They replaced my tent and Martha invited me\
  \ to have dinner with her, her husband Paul and the other couple. I don\u2018t exactly\
  \ remember our conversation this night, but it was a completely heartwarming situation,\
  \ sitting there with the stars above our heads, holding a cup of hot lemon tea and\
  \ wrapped in a warm blanket between over 40-year-older strangers. \nWhat this experience\
  \ taught me? Travelling is not always fun and adventure. Sometimes you collapse\
  \ in unexpected situations and sometimes you get even more unexpectedly surprised\
  \ by strangers\u2013in a positive way. And at the end of the day, though it might\
  \ have been a hard one, you feel like home at a place thousands of miles away."
