Text: "It\u2019s a sunny Saturday morning in the coastal town of Baler, Aurora. Directly\
  \ facing the Pacific Ocean on the east is the two-kilometer Sabang Beach with grayish\
  \ sand and akaw waves. A favorite go-to of kooks and pro surfers. And said to be\
  \ the birthplace of surfing in the Philippines. As for myself, I\u2019m a Benny\
  \ who signed up for something like a cooking lesson in a hostel using local ingredients.\
  \ Fingers crossed, for I won\u2019t burn the kitchen down.\n\nThe hostel is like\
  \ a huge nipa hut. Jam-packed with tourists and locals when I arrived, as a couple\
  \ of events were taking place. I then met Rafa, the CEO of the hostel. Who then\
  \ introduced me to chef Grai. Grai is also a Benny, but, she\u2019s one of those\
  \ who loved Baler and lived there for some time. And as a chef, she definitely knows\
  \ Baler\u2019s flavors like a local. Amped with clear skies, chef and I went to\
  \ the pop-up market showcasing local produce every Saturday. \u201DI needed to satisfy\
  \ the foodie in me,\u201D I answered when she asked me what made me sign up while\
  \ on our way to the market. We walked around inside the rustic market and she took\
  \ me to her favorite stores with unique products. Like pineapple and banana vinegar\
  \ which we bought together with local salmon, red rice, pako or fern and sweet potato\
  \ tops for the poke bowl we\u2019re making. It\u2019s called Aurora Style Poke Bowl.\
  \ As for the base, a mix of the red and white rice. Then for the protein, we got\
  \ kinilaw or local salmon ceviche. And for the side dish, a different take on fern\
  \ salad. A mix of fern and sweet potato tops with a hint of fermented fish paste\
  \ plus caramelized onions and cherry tomatoes. Chow time! We shared it with a couple\
  \ hostel staff and Jakes. After eating, she asked me to go surf but when I saw the\
  \ heavy swells that afternoon, I clucked. None the less, I chilled at the beach\
  \ until sunset.\n\nAfter Sunday\u2019s dawn patrol with glassy swells, we made a\
  \ cocktail, Pineapple Coco Whiskey. Chef laid out the ingredients. Pineapple, fresh\
  \ dill and a bottle of Banayad Whiskey, or locally distilled coconut wine for the\
  \ base spirit. I bewilderedly stared at the bottle, chef then said, \u201Cthe commercial\
  \ in a movie scene\u201D. Right, the infamous movie line, \u201DLoko loko lang ang\
  \ iinom nito!\u201D (Only fool will drink this!) Legend has it, the actor got drunk,\
  \ contrary to its name banayad or gentle due to re-takes. In my disbelief, \u201C\
  Is this for real?\u201D I asked. \u201CYes, the legend is real! Do you still want\
  \ a cocktail?\u201D she rebutted. \u201CYes, who would say no to a legend?! Cheers!\u201D"
