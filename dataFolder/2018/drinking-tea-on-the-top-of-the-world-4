Text: Based on prior adventures I always knew that I wanted to travel and see the
  world for myself.I applied to study abroad at a school in Dublin,Ireland.As the
  spring semester grew closer,I heard the news that there was a problem with my application&unfortunately
  the school I was applying to had reached capacity.I was crushed by this news but
  refused to take no for an answer.I did everything necessary for me to attend&my
  work paid off.I headed for the airport to start my voyage.Fifteen hours,three movies,&many
  packages of peanuts later,I finally arrived.With my passport stamped in one hand&my
  luggage in the other,I met a group of Irish students who gave me a tour of the campus.I
  started to get to know these individuals as they were enriched with the embodiment
  of what it means to be Irish.It can be said that the Irish are one of the most passionate
  groups of people upholding their folklore&ethnology to the most considerable extent.The
  culture of Ireland includes many customs&traditions of language,religion,music,art,literature,cuisine,&sports.These
  individuals in the short hour I got to know them,demonstrated this sense of culture.Being
  able to encompass Ireland&its inhabitants from a personal level allowed my inner
  heritage to resurface.The local connection I made throughout my time in Ireland
  was presented in an unexpected way.Through all the people I met&all the things I
  did,I started to gain a sense of bondage between Irish people&me.The linkage grew
  strong&touched my roots of Irish heritage.Ireland became my home&where I reside
  back in America transitioned into my home away from home.This journey helped me
  understand what it means to be humble.As time has passed it is evident that this
  adventure has brought me closer together with my family,our historical ties,&cultural
  significance.During those 6 months emerging myself into the Irish culture,I let
  loose of everything that was ever holding me back.I had no limitations&allowed myself
  to be free.I was fully independent for the first time&began a journey of self discovery
  as I encountered many who wanted to get to know me.These individuals subliminally
  helped shape my identity in recovering who I once was.The adventure of a lifetime
  was finding myself in the Irish people I encountered.This was a gift that I will
  cherish forever and never lose sight of again.Since Ireland I have traveled to other
  countries in expanding this idea of who I am in attempting to grow&learn more about
  myself&others along the way.
