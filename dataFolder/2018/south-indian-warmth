Text: "I did not want to shift to another city after I got so connected to my friends\
  \ in Bhopal, India. But due to my father's transferable job we had to shift. This\
  \ was deep in south of India - Chennai, Tamil Nadu.  Somehow days passed and we\
  \ shifted smoothly there and moved in our new apartment. Initially, everything was\
  \ a surprise to me. I had no idea about the Tamil language or about their culture.\
  \ Perhaps, reading from geography books don\u2019t do much help either. I started\
  \ meeting people but they didn\u2019t interest me as such. I wanted to just stay\
  \ in a room and read books avoiding any human contact. The summer heat of south\
  \ would melt the toughest heart and so it happened. One day I did go out and talked\
  \ to people. It went from day to late evening. Since then, anytime I got a chance\
  \ I would sit and talk to the people I randomly met outside. I started stepping\
  \ out of the apartment often. I made friends with the locals. Soon they started\
  \ teaching me their language. It started as fun but I grabbed so many words. The\
  \ locals have a lot of stories. The sea of the south is another sight to see. There\
  \ are a lot of beaches to go visit in Chennai. I did not know of the intensity of\
  \ the heat and I remember getting a bad tan once when I stayed from morning till\
  \ noon at the beach. After that I made sure that If I go to the beach in mornings\
  \ I would take shelter in a nearby shack until the sun goes down. Now shack near\
  \ a beach means delicious food as well. Once I climbed up to one of these cosy wooden\
  \ shack right opposite Besant beach in Chennai. We were a group of five people and\
  \ also very hungry. I was new to this place and so my friends ordered for me. It\
  \ was a chicken steak sizzler. The fried fish and chips would rule there. Sea food\
  \ was never my choice but it changes after you have lived near the sea for five\
  \ long years. There is another gentle touch to their local food. It consists of\
  \ Curd rice, tamarind rice, Sambar rice, idly podi etc.\nI learnt a lot of things\
  \ from that place and I travelled to almost every corner of that city. I even explored\
  \ the nearby getaways like Pondicherry, which is a union territory, and also other\
  \ nearby places like Maduranthakam and Mahabalipuram. I don\u2019t even remember\
  \ when did I fall in love with that place. But something about the south Indian\
  \ warmth had me softened. Even today when I visit my friends in the south, I never\
  \ feel like an outsider. I was soon a local amongst the old locals."
