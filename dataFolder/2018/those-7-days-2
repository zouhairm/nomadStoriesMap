Text: "\u201CYou don\u2019t really conquer a mountain,you conquer yourself\u201D.\n\
  \nUnbathed for 7 continuous days,fatigued to the extent of sleeping on roads if\
  \ given a chance,after walking for 17 kms that day, after pooping in dry toilets\
  \ for 7 continuous days,after sleeping in sleeping bags for 5 days(where you dress\
  \ yourself in 5 layers of warm cloths and sleep like a corpse,straight inside a\
  \ long bag) and carrying a backpack of 10 kgs on our shoulder from the past 5 days,we\
  \ were taking last steps towards Roopkund.\n\n\u201COnly 50 meters more,come on,come\
  \ on!\" an unconscious Sakshi heard someone say these words from behind.\n\n\u201C\
  One step at a time, just one step.\" I heard my mind telling me. 50 meters and around\
  \ 5 mins later,we saw the first sight of mysterious Roopkund lake.Never in my life\
  \ I had ever come across something as surreal,enigmatic and majestic as Roopkund\
  \ before.Amidst the white layer of ice lay peacefully-some water that had become\
  \ translucent ice showcasing bundles of human bones,skulls and torn clothes from\
  \ 1200 AD lying in its depth( the lake is said to be mysterious because there are\
  \ stuffs of such kind lying there without any concrete theory for the same).\n\n\
  Have you ever been so spell bound by something so beautiful that you feel the urge\
  \ to bow down in front of it? I think I did.Within no time,tears of happiness started\
  \ rolling down.I had never been so happy in my entire life of 21 years.I cried for\
  \ 15 mins sitting there.Something that I had seen in pictures 4 months ago,was right\
  \ there in front of me.You ask me what is your biggest moment of happiness? I would\
  \ say, THIS. Achieving the targets that you have set for yourself\u2013this is the\
  \ biggest happiness.It was a dream come true.If bursting in tears out of happiness\
  \ is not success,then I am not sure what is! 3 years of savings that I had spent\
  \ on this trek paid off in the form of those 30 minutes where I saw myself bursting\
  \ out.In happiness.In ecstacy.\n\nAnd this is how my first Himalayan trek happened.This\
  \ is where I acknowledged that \u201CMountains are calling and I must go\u201D holds\
  \ true.This is where I found the purpose of my life.\n\nThis trek has made me the\
  \ person I am today.This decision, to experience this trek for once, has pushed\
  \ me to the edge. This decision, to walk ONE STEP AT A TIME has pushed me to the\
  \ edge.This decision, to exhaust myself and yet learn a million things, has pushed\
  \ me to the edge. \n\n*Tears of happiness roll down as I write this*"
