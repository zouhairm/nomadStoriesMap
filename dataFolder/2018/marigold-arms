Text: "It\u2019s a little different out there. Miles of barren land is dotted by bushes.\
  \ The road is tarred, charcoal black. It is constanthouses.Commandant Dass was stationed\
  \ at his post, essentially a shelter made out of stone and mortar.\u2018So what\
  \ are you doing here?\u2019 He said.What was I doing there? I was yet not sure.\
  \ It was a long weekend. Though weekends had lost their charm in my life these days,\
  \ it was ironical that I had chosen a weekend for the trip to the desert. The aimless\
  \ wanderings yet again. A backpack and a bike.  It was a cry from the strange lands\
  \ like these, always alluring, always intriguing. Always providing the simplest\
  \ of the For how long have you been here?\u2019\n\u20183 years, we live in those\
  \ barracks\u2019, the Comm. answered.Comm. Dass was on patrol. Places writers and\
  \ musicians flock towards, for getting that creative genius out. I thought of inns,\
  \ houses in the woods, work desks of writers, their silent rooms of meditation.\n\
  \u2018Where were you, before here?\u2019 I was talking in questions now.\nThe longest\
  \ term has been in Kashmir\u2019.\nThe last word drew my full attention. \u2018\
  Where in Kashmir\u2019?\n\u2018I was stationed in 4 places there. Poonch, Kupwara,\
  \ Baramulla and Srinagar. This was when the militancy was at its peak. People were\
  \ afraid and all the areas were heavily militarized\u2019. He said in one go. \u2018\
  We did not go into armed combat with the enemy but security and maintaining peace\
  \ was our job\u2019.\n\u2018Which weapon did you use\u2019? My mind shifted back\
  \ to my limited knowledge on weaponry.When asked about the concentration camps for\
  \ apprehended militants, he said he might have heard about those. People were taken\
  \ prisoners and were interrogated.\u2018We enjoy combat sometimes\u2019. He seemed\
  \ to remember an incident and shrugged off my question, the way I had, moments ago.\u2018\
  There was a day I remember of. It was dusk and we were on patrolling a place close\
  \ to the LOC at Poonch. There were seven sepoys with me. Then out of nowhere, Bam!!\
  \ Bullets were fired in our direction. We all dispersed to find cover. I remember\
  \ the rush I had, crawling on the ground, while looking for a safe place to fire\
  \ my gun and kill those militants. Bullets from different guns fire differently\
  \ and.Then some were yellow and they looked like marigolds. And we lived through\
  \ that. A flower shower from the enemy!\u2018Wow! How did you survive then\u2019\
  ? I asked.He pointed his finger towards the sky. \u2019God was on our side\u2019\
  .I thought of the question he had asked me. \u2018Why was I there?\u2019I thought\
  \ to myself, \u2019Maybe, only for this story\u2019."
