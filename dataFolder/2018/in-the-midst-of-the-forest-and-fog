Text: "Wait wait!! Before booking the tickets for the Real Scotland, have you seen\
  \ the Scotland of the East? \nIf not then let me take you to this amazing journey\
  \ of Shillong.\nShillong is the capital of the Meghalaya. It's one of the beautiful\
  \ hill in india. So when you'll enter this breathtaking hill station, you might\
  \ feel that it looks like Shimla.\nAs the name of the state suggests \"Meghalaya\"\
  \ which means \"clouds are coming\" in Hindi, and that is why it's also known as\
  \ \"The Abode of Clouds\". \n\nNow let's plan how you would like to travel..\nAs\
  \ it is a hill station it doesn't have a airport and nor the railways!!\nSo now\
  \ we've limited options which will make your entire journey worth.\nOne can take\
  \ a State Bus or a taxi from Guwahati and it will take approximately 2-3 hours(\
  \ depends upon the weather)\nOn the way you'll see some of the best views of the\
  \ world..\nOnce you reach there... You can easily find some place for accommodation.\n\
  Now as it rains there almost everyday... Its very important to carry a umbrella\
  \ or a raincoat!! \nIf you starts with the main city..don't miss the happening \"\
  Police Bazar\" for shopping and for the yummy food!\nDouble decker root bridge and\
  \ single decker root bridge are the compulsions. If you're visiting Shillong then\
  \ it should be on your priority list. It will hardly take 2-3 hours of a journey.\
  \ \n\nNow let's move to the Most rainiest place in the world..\"Cherrapunji\" ,\
  \ It's rains for 200- 250 days per year..and some little shower could be happen\
  \ anytime.  And from the top one can see the Bangladesh Border!! Yes If the climate\
  \ is clear you can easily see the Our lovely neighboring country. \nThe  we've some\
  \ of the beautiful waterfalls in Shillong. The seven sisters falls and the elephanta\
  \ falls are the most popular ones.\n\nThen we've the most wanted place on our list..\"\
  Shillong Peak or Shillong Point\" . One can see entire Shillong from there..but\
  \ for this you actually need to make some prayers to your god to make the weather\
  \ clear and if it's raining then it's very tough and the visibility reduces to even\
  \ 20 Meters.\n\nYou might feel proud by saying that Meghalaya has Asia's cleanest\
  \ village. Don't forget to go there.\n\n Even for the army lovers it's a win win\
  \ show because here you'll see the Headquarter of AssamRifles. Assam Rifles is the\
  \ oldest Paramilitary force in the country and by just seeing the building once\
  \ can imagine how huge and beautiful it is.\nIt's situated on a high hill so one\
  \ can spot it easily once you're in the main city."
