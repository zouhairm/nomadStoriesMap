Text: "Imagine your heart pounding louder than the waterfalls. That's how I felt as\
  \ the clock was counting down the rest of my time in Jajce. In a week, I got to\
  \ learn some amazing things and meet many amazing people. But my trip had to finish\
  \ one day earlier. When I was starting the trip I really didn\u2019t know what to\
  \ expect. To be honest, I had expected so little. Bosnia and Herzegovina is just\
  \ another neighboring country of Serbia. It is thought to offer only minefields.\
  \ But, even for a thrill-seeker that I am, stumbling upon all those beauties was\
  \ even better than stumbling upon the minefield. \nMy odyssey started from Banja\
  \ Luka, from where we had set off to Jajce. Soon, my expectations were not only\
  \ fulfilled but were also rising with each kilometer. A beautiful canyon with a\
  \ greenish river, fighting the frost, reflected white tops of hills around us. The\
  \ colors were dancing some strange, but eye-appealing \u201Ckolo\u201D and I fell\
  \ asleep. \nFinally, the bus entered Jajce\u2026\nWhen I turned around the corner,\
  \ down I looked and so much I was offered to see. Waterfalls. Just another proof\
  \ how much people wrong their neighbors. Another day, I was shown the splendent\
  \ Old City. This city was a crossroad of many civilizations. And yet, it stood still,\
  \ proud of its history. Just as you enter it, you can check the catacombs. While\
  \ there I experienced that awkward \"In whose grave am I standing?\" moment. Luckily,\
  \ the resting place had never welcomed its owner, Duke Hrvatic. \nChurches, towers,\
  \ lovely \u201Csokaks\u201D, myths... As you head down for the exit on the other\
  \ side of Jajce, the air becomes warmer and filled with many scents that come from\
  \ the restaurants in the foothill. After one long walk, one of them was the place\
  \ I went to.\nThe everyday excursions would end up with our Youth Hostel - a place\
  \ of many funs.\nTonight can\u2019t exactly be called that way. The moon is full.\
  \ I\u2019m looking at the hangover teenagers heading their homes. At last. the whole\
  \ city is asleep, except the waterfalls. And the whole place is mine now, the very\
  \ symbol of the city. A little light appears in the distance and I soon realize\
  \ it's the sun, already. I have to go. But something is stopping me. I lock my gaze\
  \ upon a little island just in the middle of the falling point... It calls me. I\
  \ let my backpack slide down. With one foot I walk into the shallow lakelet. The\
  \ cold doesn\u2019t bother me and now I\u2019m standing on the island. Something\
  \ in the air\u2026 I know I shouldn't\u2026 One step. Another one. One more. \n\
  And\u2026\nI jump."
