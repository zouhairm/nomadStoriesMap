Text: "The Baltic countries of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania may not be the first\
  \ countries that come to ones mind when thinking of Europe \u2013 but what these\
  \ countries offer goes well beyond anyone\u2019s expectations. \n\nThese unique\
  \ countries have a fascinating yet troubled history, influenced heavily by the bordering\
  \ Russia. The Baltic states are now thriving and offer a mix of outdoor adventure,\
  \ medieval buildings and hospitality, friendly yet reserved locals and a plethora\
  \ of unique food options.\n\nAfter catching the ferry from Helsinki, it was the\
  \ mesmerisingly stunning Tallinn with its medieval and gothic style buildings that\
  \ immediately become a very welcome photographic memory to cherish forever. \n\n\
  It was time to head to Latvia to meet its intriguing capital city Riga. The hostel\
  \ offered a Bobsledding adventure \u2013 \u2018well, yes, of course!\u2019 Excitement\
  \ began to brew overnight about what bobsledding would be like; surely it would\
  \ be a nice ride.\n\nIn the morning we boarded the bus with some other travellers\
  \ staying at the same hostel. The most notable a large group of Brits, who were\
  \ all excited for the adventure to come. We arrived at the bobsled track, the Russian\
  \ team were training, we were to go in between their runs. The British men took\
  \ their turn.\n\nIt was our turn now. After signing a waiver in Estonian, the instructions\
  \ from the Latvian guide were simply \u2018stiff neck, hold on\u2019. In the rickety\
  \ old bobsled we get. Take off! This is nice. Until the first turn and bang, after\
  \ the first turn my head is thrust forward and it\u2019s the foetal position from\
  \ now on. It\u2019s a nightmare; crashing, clunking, banging, screaming and screeching.\
  \ 45 seconds feels like 45 minutes! When we arrive at the finish line, the British\
  \ men were still hunched over, in disbelief, still recovering. Not a word was spoken\
  \ on the way back. Everyone was in utter shock at the pure intensity and roughness\
  \ of bobsledding.\n\nIt was recovery mode back at the hostel, no-one really spoke\
  \ about the bobsledding, most of us were sick in the stomach, even until the next\
  \ day. Great adventure, bucket list tick, but never again. The next day was a chance\
  \ to go husky dog sledding, a far more relaxing form of sledding I can guarantee\
  \ you. We enjoyed the spoils that Riga had to offer before heading even further\
  \ south to Vilnius, Lithuania. \n\nLithuania offers a broad history, some stirring\
  \ castles, lovely scenery, the locals know how to enjoy themselves and there is\
  \ no bobsled track. This was a perfect ending to the Baltic adventure!"
