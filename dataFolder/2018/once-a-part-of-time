Text: "Once a part of time\u2026..it was alittle girl growing up in a small village\
  \ close to the forrest in the middle of Sweden. Didn\xB4t know about the world out\
  \ there.\nWhen she was 14 years young, after highschool she went on a school trip.\
  \ They went to Riccione in Italy and saw Venezia & San Marino. A new world opened\
  \ up for this little girl from the countryside. She desided allready then to conquer\
  \ the world.\nAnd she did, her whole life she has been travelling and working all\
  \ over the world.\nToday a the magical 55+ years, she still have the\_passion for\
  \ travelling, after 40 years just following her dreams.\nHere I will share a story,\
  \ which touched my heart deeply.\nAt the age 22. I had already been working on sailingboats\
  \ in the Carribean. Delivered a sailingboat from St.Thomas to San Diego.\nMeeting\
  \ my big love in life. Canadian guy.\nWent back to Sweden after we delivered a car\
  \ from San Fransisco to N.Y in june.\n\nThen I was back in the fall to meet my boyfriend\
  \ in Marthas Vineyard.\nOur plans was to sail down to Carribean and work on a sailingboat\
  \ for the winterseason.\nBut \"You make plans, and God is laughing at you\" ; ))\n\
  It didn't work out...\nWith 100$ in my pocket and just arrived on a one-way ticket\
  \ to N.Y\_\nWhat to do??? \nDesided to go to Newport.R.I. and find a delivery boat\
  \ to the Carribean.\nStarted to look for a cheap place to stay. Everything fully\
  \ booked. Ended up in the Seamens church institute.\nThey where also fully booked.\
  \ But the Priest offert me to sleep on his couch in the office. This is year 1984.\n\
  After a week I found a sailingboat to take me to the Carribean with a stop in Bermuda.\
  \ I thanked the Priest for the couch and asked how much I should pay?\n( I hardly\
  \ had anything left from my 100$) He said nothing. He wished me good luck. And I\
  \ went off to meet the captain & the crew.\_\nAgain God is laughing at me....\n\
  The captain said he could not take me..beacause he\nwas taking crew in Bermuda.\
  \ And I said, just give me a ride to Bermuda. I find another boat there. Now I was\n\
  really pushed to the edge. Just a few $ in my pocket.\nThe captain said no. What\
  \ to do????\nWent back to the Seamens church institute. The Priest gave me back\
  \ the key to his office. And asked me if I needed money. That was the last thing\
  \ I expected.\nIt touched my heart deeply. But of course I could not accept money\
  \ from the Priest.\_\nI stayed on the couch for another week. Then I found another\
  \ sailingboat to take me to the Carribean.\nAnd new adventures was waiting for me\
  \ there."
