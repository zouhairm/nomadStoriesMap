Text: "It's already been four years, and I still can't forgive myself for having lost\
  \ my last smartphone. In there, there were more than photos of my year around Australia,\
  \ there were more than messages sent and received to and from my friends in Italy.\
  \ There was a phone number. A phone number of a person that keeps coming back in\
  \ my mind, although four years have passed. She never gave me a Facebook address,\
  \ just her number. And memories, lots of them. We met in Cronulla, just outside\
  \ Sydney, in the guest-house where I lived for four months. She lived there too,\
  \ maybe she still does. We met like everyone else in the house, in the kitchen,\
  \ the only common space that everyone had no chance to avoid. Our first meeting\
  \ happened because I definitely suck at cooking and since she saw me in trouble\
  \ and she was a chef, she bravely taught an Italian how to cook. She was what every\
  \ man don't want her woman to be. She was technically a man, with no grace in her\
  \ movements, she smoke like a chimney, she cursed like a sailor and she hated everyone.\
  \ Maybe that's what bond us together, because I was in the same temporary mood of\
  \ hate for everyone. I want to specify \u201Ctemporary\u201D because I'm not like\
  \ that, and neither was she, but at that time I lost my job, I was alone in an other\
  \ country, and I lived in the same room with a boy who did only two things: work\
  \ in a fish & chips shop, and not showering. Technically even if I never worked\
  \ there, it\u2019s like I lived 24/7 in the fish and chips shop. She hated him too,\
  \ and you know, nothing brings people together like the hate for the same person.\
  \ And here we were, making fun of this guy, whose nationality I won't tell you,\
  \ because I\u2019m not racist. This women and I shared a lot of time talking together,\
  \ all my slang language definitely comes from her. I was only 23 and she had a son\
  \ of my age, so maybe that's why she always kept a special eye on me. She even found\
  \ a temporary job for me. Guess where. In a van that made fish & chips, the ones\
  \ you see at the festivals and events like that. Karma struck again. At the end\
  \ she told me why she was in Cronulla, even though she was a Queenslander She was\
  \ there because she needed to recover from a surgery to her stomach cancer, and\
  \ she decided to come to Cronulla because she was a huge fan of the Sharks team,\
  \ the local team. That's why in my phone her name was Lara Sharks. I met so many\
  \ people, but she's the one I remember the most, and most nostalgically. And I don't\
  \ even know her complete name."
