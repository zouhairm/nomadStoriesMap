Text: "A nod. Our sign to get off the bus. We grab our food bags filled with a few\
  \ dozen of dried dates we bought on the side of the road in the Atlas Mountains\
  \ and while getting off we hear some guys quietly whispering some words we cannot\
  \ understand towards us. And there we two are, next to the Sahara dunes. Both of\
  \ us have never seen the desert before, so we spend the next couple of minutes between\
  \ being amazed and making jokes about how unreal it looks. Its colours vary with\
  \ the sun from the brightest yellow to the darkest orange. After a few moments of\
  \ enjoying how we can see endless amounts of sand, we turn around and only then\
  \ notice we are on the middle of a small dusty path leading towards our first destination:\
  \ a little Berber hostel.  Walking in, the first thing we see are two black cats\
  \ lying in the morning sun and then we hear someone welcome us. It\u2019s Hassan,\
  \ he is the owner of the hostel, around 30 years old and wearing a traditional Moroccan\
  \ dress for men. His hostel isn\u2019t quite ready yet but we get one of the three\
  \ rooms that are. \nI grab my book and sit down in front of the hostel but the temperature\
  \ in the dunes is weird. I can feel my skin get sunburnt and at the same time I\
  \ have Goosebumps all over. I close my eyes and by the time I open them Hassan sits\
  \ next to me.\n\u201CWhat you reading?\u201D\nMe showing him the book cover of to\
  \ read Tuhami, a portrait about a Moroccan, who believes that he is possessed by\
  \ a she-demon called Aisha Qandisha. \n\u201CHassan, you believe in demons?\u201D\
  \n\u201CHeard of a dschnun?\u201D\n\u201CAisha Qandisha is one right?\u201D\nNodding\n\
  \u201CThis guy in my book he believes that he\u2019s married to her. But I don\u2019\
  t understand.\u201D\nThen he makes me watch a French interview I can barely understand\
  \ about an elderly man telling his story about how Aisha Qandisha has lived in him\
  \ and about the ceremonies through which the brotherhood had to get rid of the demon.\
  \ \nThen he starts explaining. \n\u201CYou know a man walking down streets talking\
  \ to himself? He got a dschnun. Lalla Aisha. It\u2019s not him talking, it\u2019\
  s her. She in him. You need to get rid of demon with ceremony. Every demon has its\
  \ melody and this is played. The dancers are getting in trance and you need knives\
  \ \u2013 you know iron \u2013 or hot water or glass. They do crazy stuff with this.\
  \ Crazy stuff. In video they used to put the possessed in box with snakes.\u201D\
  \nBoth being silent for a long little while.\n\u201CAnd about Aisha, she looks like\
  \ a camel-foot?\u201D\n\u201CYou see black cat. Black cats can be Aisha Qandisha.\
  \ Different forms.\u201D"
