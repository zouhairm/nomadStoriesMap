Text: "The man outside the hotel club is rangy, plain in dark pants and a white shirt,\
  \ executing complicated dance steps. He drops a knee and stretches a leg behind\
  \ him, toes skimming the floor. His eyes are closed, his smile wistful. He\u2019\
  s alone. \n\nSteve and I walk past. On our last night in Singapore, we have a drink\
  \ coupon and no energy left. \u201CWe won\u2019t stay long,\u201D he says. The club\
  \ is dim, all velvety blue light and pulsing music. Everyone is dancing. We\u2019\
  re the only westerners, badly underdressed by Singapore standards. The women are\
  \ exquisite, the room a sea of glossy hair, silk blouses, and designer jeans. It\
  \ is impossible to read their ages. Couples move easily around the floor, break\
  \ apart, come back together. Their energy is contagious. I slurp my drink and declare\
  \ that I want to dance. \n\n\u201CNo way,\u201D Steve says. \u201CNo.\u201D \n\n\
  \u201CFine. But I'm getting closer.\u201D \n\nHe follows me as I thread through\
  \ the blue light. People notice us watching, smile and nod. They know they\u2019\
  re good. An old man registers my interest and shouts, \u201CHello! You like the\
  \ dancing?\u201D\n\nYes, we like the dancing very much. This is a weekly dancing\
  \ club, we're told. \u201CYou should dance! Don\u2019t be afraid!\u201D \n\nDespite\
  \ my longing, I balk. \u201COh, I couldn\u2019t. I don\u2019t know the steps.\u201D\
  \ \n\n\u201CBah! Just go! No one will mind! No one will watch you!\u201D\n\nI can\u2019\
  t help myself. The dancers and the gin have restored my energy. I join the women,\
  \ drab among these sleek beauties. One woman makes eye contact with me and creates\
  \ space. I watch her feet, her light steps, the turn of her ankle traveling through\
  \ her hip, glancing up to be sure I\u2019m doing it right. She nods, taps her friend\
  \ on the shoulder and soon we are a small circle of dancing women. I take up too\
  \ much room. My dancing is awkward. The man is half right. People are looking at\
  \ me, but they don\u2019t seem to mind. \n\nThe song ends and we dissolve into a\
  \ laughing knot, the women congratulating me while I demur, pleased and embarrassed.\
  \ We slide into another song, a loose salsa that threads among the women. Later\
  \ I find myself dancing a cha-cha with the man who had been practicing outside.\
  \ The music stops only once. Lights go up and the pulsing club turns into an ordinary\
  \ bar. Two young men from behind the bar smile shyly as the dancers serenade them\
  \ with a cacophonous Happy Birthday. We join in, clapping as they blow out the candles\
  \ on a homemade cake. The old man, balancing two slices, approaches us again. Smiling,\
  \ he hands the one with a fresh strawberry on top to me."
