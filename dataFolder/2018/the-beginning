Text: "\"Has bus 11 passed?\" An old man asks me in Italian. He sits next to me and\
  \ looks at me with a big smile. It\u2019s a quiet afternoon. Everybody must be preparing\
  \ for New Year's Eve. I try to answer, smiling, in very shy Italian, \"I don't think\
  \ so.\" He keeps making conversation. \"It's so cold today, right?\" I reply with\
  \ the same smile, \"Yes.\" Maybe with my backpack and all the clothes I\u2019m wearing,\
  \ the snowy weather in Turin failed to get my attention. I\u2019ve been sitting\
  \ at this bus stop for 40 minutes, and I still have no idea what to do, where to\
  \ go. \nI decided to leave. But where? How? I just left. I packed up everything\
  \ I could, my few valuables in a bag, already dirty from my previous trips, put\
  \ on the heaviest clothes, and the running shoes in a shopping bag. \"They cost\
  \ me a lot,\" I rationalized. I hadn't go for a run since I'd arrived in Turin 3\
  \ months ago. I wasn\u2019t used to the cold and I always said, someday warm, I'll\
  \ go for a run. I was still waiting for that day. \nI\u2019d managed to pack all\
  \ I needed and I was ready to start a trip to the unknown, even to me. I'd thought\
  \ about it many times, the idea of picking up everything and leaving, traveling\
  \ the world, as I'd seen so many times in those travel blogs that I loved. But I\
  \ was stuck. It wasn\u2019t until the moment he said it. \"We are over\".\nAt that\
  \ very moment, a revolution started in my head. We are over. It's time. I said.\
  \ I saw it coming. I knew it too, but I loved him, and I was trying. I'd left my\
  \ life in Valencia 3 months ago. We wanted more than a long distance relationship,\
  \ so when he asked me to move in with him, I said yes. What could go wrong? We were\
  \ perfect together. But still, that place he carved in his life for me didn\u2019\
  t fit me quite right. I tried to adapt myself, to his friends, his family, the culture,\
  \ the language, but it wasn't enough. We knew something wasn't right.\nOn December\
  \ 31st, at 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I took my things and decided to leave. I\
  \ could've waited, stopped and thought twice. I could've stayed in the city, or\
  \ returned to the comfort I already knew in Spain. I could've tried and solved something\
  \ that I already knew was broken. I could\u2019ve. But it wasn\u2019t what I wanted.\
  \ I had already made up my mind.\nYes. I rang in the new year on a bus heading for\
  \ southern Italy. There was no countdown or champagne at midnight. No warm hug when\
  \ the clock struck 12. There was only the darkness of the road and a soft snoring\
  \ from the back of the bus.\nAnd I never felt freedom like that."
