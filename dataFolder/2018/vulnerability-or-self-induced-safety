Text: "The savor of being alone is not always beautiful. That idealism can drag you\
  \ to a grueling battleground of depression. I've been preparing for various MBA\
  \ entrances for past 2 years, caught up in the castle of textbooks. I was learning\
  \ but at the same time losing myself. My \u201Cstudy all day\u201D mantra made me\
  \ an introvert.\nOne day as I was reading through the articles, my eyes caught attention\
  \ of an ad for the very famous desert festival of Jaisalmer, a city that lies in\
  \ the heart of Thar desert.\nThis filled me with a celestial energy. I booked my\
  \ tickets, got my bag packed and left. I knew this is something something that I\u2019\
  ve never done before. In India you barely get a chance, especially if you\u2019\
  re a woman, to do a solo travel. But I wanted to experience this so I left a note\
  \ and headed towards it. \nJaisalmer is a known world heritage site, sprinkled with\
  \ many sandstone heritages. It is a town popular for winter getaway, and one of\
  \ the most exotic honeymoon destinations. There are no airport facilities, but travelling\
  \ via road & railways is definitely an option. As the train headed towards my destination,\
  \ on different stations I encountered a variety of tastes, food, colors, languages\
  \ and attires. Finally I reached Jaisalmer and got myself settled. The city area\
  \ was beautiful with no serious traffic. It had a different aura. I landed in the\
  \ very famous Jaisalmer fort. People actually lived inside the fort. I expected\
  \ only Royal families to be inside. A blend of colors, culture, antiques, dresses,\
  \ the fort had different stores. There was a shop where they were writing your name\
  \ on rice. I got one done for myself. Also I bought one traditional skirt and bangles.\
  \ Here women can go crazy while shopping, because everything is so beautiful. I\
  \ tried daal-baati (their local dish). Rajasthani people have a great sense of taste.\
  \ I was amused with the delicious cuisine.\nNext day I left for the desert festival.\
  \ It provides tourists a glance of the imperial culture of Rajasthan. It showcases\
  \ Rajasthani folk songs, dance, exhibits local elements and heritage. You can also\
  \ encounter snake charmers, puppet shows, acrobatic performances. Exciting competitions\
  \ like Mr. Desert contest, turban tying, longest mustache, camel race are also organized\
  \ to enhance the fun. It was a soothing experience.\nThis journey made me explore\
  \ myself. Now I feel that choosing vulnerability over self induced safety was the\
  \ decision that pushed me to the edge."
