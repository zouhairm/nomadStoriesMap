Text: "Raise your hand if you never said at least once time in your life \"That\u2019\
  s enough, I drop everything and I move\u201D. Leave a stressful job, run from a\
  \ bad ending story, or feel like you need to explore unknown places and live new\
  \ emotions. If there's one thing I've learned in life, it's that travel is always\
  \ the best medicine.\n\nI never thought I'd find the strength to travel alone in\
  \ a unfamiliar place. If I think about it now, I\u2019m still amazed.  You can say\
  \ you really lived in a place only if, when you left it, you still have a feeling\
  \ of it. This is exactly what happens after my Indonesian trip.\n\nClose your eyes\
  \ and listen to the sound of the sea breaking on the rocks of Tanah Lot, the Sunset\
  \ Temple. Breathe in the delightful perfume of frangipani, the sacred flowers. Enjoy\
  \ the intense taste of Kopi Luwak, one of the finest coffee in the world. Try the\
  \ delicate touch of a silk sarong and wear your best smile.  Get lost in the silence\
  \ of nature and look deep into the heart of things. The love for life and the universe\
  \ around you will knock on your soul\u2019s door soon and you\u2019ll feel at home.\n\
  \nHere there is time to think and meditate and the right space to breathe; a small\
  \ earthly paradise with emerald green rice terraces and a blinding blue sea. Open\
  \ your mind and breathe free, like a balloon on the horizon. You will fly over magnificent\
  \ mountains, sleeper volcanoes and unique black sand beaches. Nature has painted\
  \ landscapes that will take your breath away and your gaze, like the one of the\
  \ locals, will be enchanted and filled with wonder.\n\nIndonesia was a five senses\
  \ travel. People live slowly with no clocks and timetables. They never know how\
  \ long it will take to get them to destination . There may be thousand unforeseens,\
  \ but they accept it with serenity because it is part of their daily life. Often\
  \ the only thing they have is nature, but that's enough for them and it's all they\
  \ need. Everyday they will be amazed at how wonderful this gift is and they will\
  \ thank God for being so lucky.\n\nMy biggest takeaway from Indonesia is a sense\
  \ of harmony, as if all the things I saw were created just for me. It taught me\
  \ to appreciate the little things that I previously took for granted; I learned\
  \ to say thank you for the little joy of life. Fall in love with life was the last\
  \ thing I expected during my solo trip."
