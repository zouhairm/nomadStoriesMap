Text: "When I was going on a 15 days\u2019 trip with my class, I had a very good idea\
  \ of what to expect. Before commencing any trip, I have the habit of intense research\
  \ prior to travel. I didn\u2019t expect any surprises on the trip.I have never been\
  \ more wrong. It took me travelling to a small Central American country to realize\
  \ that what we find on an internet search is but the tip of the iceberg. It is only\
  \ by travelling do you realize that there is much more beneath the surface. By the\
  \ time I left Costa Rica, I realized, I barely scratched the surface and many secrets\
  \ still exist in its depths which may never be known to me.One of the first places\
  \ we visited was Monteverde Cloud Forest. A short trek up, would make you walk through\
  \ the clouds. The suspension Bridge in the forest which comes as a part of the sky\
  \ walk is amazing. If you are an avid lover of heights, this bridge is has a view\
  \ to fall in love with. Kekoldi Reserve is of the indigenous people of Costa Rica.\
  \ The reserve is so secluded that it receives electricity only for two hours a day.\
  \ It is the home to a tribe who has the most wonderful stories to tell. There are\
  \ multiple treks from that point to a watchtower, where I got a picture of a bush\
  \ chat and an eyelash pit viper. The Kekoldi region is one of the most untouched\
  \ places. For the Photography enthusiast, Costa Rica is an absolute delight. A must\
  \ try is the coffee, even for someone who isn't an enthusiast. For the coffee lover,\
  \ it is a feeling of paradise and the rich taste is something very unique. It is\
  \ also an unique insight into the Amazon rainforest and environmental awareness.\
  \ Costa Rica is a nation that derives over 80% of its electric supply by hydroelectricity.\
  \ They have an extremely sustainable method of Rain water harvesting. For a nature\
  \ loving traveller, Costa Rica is a nation to stop by. I expected a great many things,\
  \ but what I experienced was something I would never have expected."
