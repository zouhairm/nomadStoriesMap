Text: "Travelling, meeting new people, exploring and volunteering has been always\
  \ my passion. For me these mean learning, growing and living. As a member of  charity\
  \ association Vincentian Marian Youth, I went to a two-week-long project, Service\
  \ Camp, in Shkodra, Albania on July 2016. The purpose of the camp was to serve different\
  \ groups of people in need. I served one week at center of mentally disabled people.\
  \ It is interesting when you find your self helping people that you never met before,\
  \ and most probably you will not meet again. A rhetorical question arises - what\
  \ makes one do that? It is because the spirit of the camp was like that and it inspires\
  \ you - helping others without any interest and doing so with modesty. And the best\
  \ thing is when you see dozen of youth and teenagers were doing so with full of\
  \ enthusiasm, it triggers you even more. It was so interesting for me to work with\
  \ people with mental disorder and hear their life stories. I heard words that expressed\
  \ remorse for their acts, regret, compassion, and above all - a huge loneliness.\
  \ They were people who, either did not have any relative, or have some that rarely\
  \ visit them. I have never though that someone can suffer from loneliness - NEVER.\
  \ I have never though that someone would say: \"this was the most cheerful week\"\
  \ just because we went there and spent time with them playing cards, doing crafts,\
  \ or draw an amateur portrait of some of them. After such an experience, what a\
  \ youth like me can think is starting to be thankful for some things that I never\
  \ thought before - my beloved ones. Once upon a time, I used to think that we all\
  \ have what we deserve to have, but life made me to realize that this is not always\
  \ the case. Unfortunately, there are many cases where people miss the beloved ones\
  \ or miss even the basic needs. Inequality seems to be the biggest challenge to\
  \ overcome. All I know is that we all have different mission to accomplish. \nAs\
  \ a Kosovo passport holder, I can not move freely in Europe due to visa restriction.\
  \ However, I have overcome this challenge many times due to my desire for travelling.\
  \ I go in Europe and I meet youth who have full of opportunities, and we here in\
  \ Western Balkans face unfair obstacles to reach our dreams. Here I find another\
  \ inequality. \nThat conversation I had in psychiatry  of Shkodra, made me think\
  \ to think very deeply for this issue. It made me more empathic person and open\
  \ minded."
