Text: "Sunlight ricocheted off the clouds, filling the cabin with a saffron glow.\
  \ I pressed my nose against the cold glass, Pakistan\u2019s peaks rising like icebergs\
  \ from the waning blue. The in-flight crew wheeled orange juice and coffee down\
  \ the aisle as the captain announced Delhi weather: 75 degrees. Fifteen degrees\
  \ warmer than San Francisco. I looked down at a well-worn copy of Yogananda\u2019\
  s Autobiography of a Yogi and thought, today a dream comes true. \n\nHeavy bags\
  \ and wrinkled faces packed the sidewalk, a tapestry of fuchsia, turquoise, mustard,\
  \ smoke, horns, and, cars. So many cars. 1400 new cars are added to the streets\
  \ of Delhi every day, yet we found the one waiting for us and dove into the backseat,\
  \ once again sealed into near-silence, fish plunging back into their tank. Through\
  \ the glass young men displayed stacks of cheap English paperbacks, smiling and\
  \ gesturing towards the biography of Steve Jobs, hoping for a sale. Our guide offered\
  \ plastic bottles of water from the front seat. \u201CDon\u2019t give them any money.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWe sipped water in the temperature-controlled Mercedes and watched as a young\
  \ boy pulled down his pants and defecated on the curb. Four-passenger mopeds swerved\
  \ and merged among brightly colored trucks, HORN PLEASE painted on rear doors. Monkeys\
  \ crept over white and pink-trimmed mansions and crumbling walls as we passed from\
  \ New Delhi into Old Delhi, the newer city, having been raided, destroyed, and rebuilt\
  \ six times.\n\nThe last thing I wrote in my journal before I got sick was \u201C\
  How could I possibly digest all of this?\u201D Apparently I couldn\u2019t. And no,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t our inaugural feast - creamy murgh dum pukht, Kashmiri Kanaguchhi,\
  \ lamb biryani, papadums, pickles, buttery yellow dal, naan pillows, and vats of\
  \ yogurt so light and fluffy it had the texture of tart whipped cream. It was babies\
  \ crawling through gutters filled with plastic bags where cows grazed next to men\
  \ getting their teeth pulled with metal pliers beside older women dragging carts\
  \ of bananas heavier than themselves and younger women balancing wood on their heads\
  \ while stray dogs lounged in the road, too hungry, too tired, too defeated to move.\n\
  \nThe discrepancy was too much. Pressure accumulated. The glass between India and\
  \ me had to shatter. When it did I found myself waking upon a rope bed in a weaver\u2019\
  s home, peaceful and calm away from the city as birds sang into air a perfect blend\
  \ of cool and warm against my aching skin. Finally I had arrived in India, beneath\
  \ a sea of sari rainbows."
