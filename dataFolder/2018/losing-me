Text: "As I walked away from my hotel, the streets of Rome lit up with possibility.\
  \ It was late but I was more than ready to start exploring as I passed by a small\
  \ restaurant. \u201CAquila Nera\u201D I whispered. I knew it meant \u2018Black Eagle\u2019\
  \ and wondered why it\u2019s owner had chosen an eagle as the symbol for the restaurant,\
  \ promising myself I\u2019d go back to ask before my time in Rome ended. Two nights\
  \ later, after a riveting day of exploring the Piazza di Trevi, I found myself back\
  \ at Aquila Nera. I made eye contact with a cute waiter who seemed around my age\
  \ and decided to stay, convincing myself it was because I was hungry rather than\
  \ because of that waiter. After eating and flirting with the waiter, Luca, I found\
  \ myself saying goodnight and promising I\u2019d be back again soon. \n\nI didn\u2019\
  t realize what I had done until I found myself back there again, this time only\
  \ for drinks and dessert. Luca and I flirted again, and I excused myself to the\
  \ bathroom. I guess he took my flirtation as an invitation because next thing I\
  \ knew, I walked out of the bathroom and there he was. I didn\u2019t have much time\
  \ to think as he kissed me and started to move his hands down my body. I quickly\
  \ sobered up enough to realize what I was doing. I was kissing a stranger and I\
  \ knew that this, all of this, was not who I was. So I pushed him away and said\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to, I tried to leave. It was a bit harder than I\u2019d thought\
  \ it\u2019d be, as he was blocking the doorway. \n\nHe tried to calm me down and\
  \ went back to kissing me and touching me, I said it again, more force in my voice\
  \ this time. Nothing changed. I pushed him off more violently and screamed \u201C\
  NO\u201D in a voice that sounded strained, but it was as loud as I could scream\
  \ at the time. I took his shock as an opportunity to leave. He spent the rest of\
  \ the night trying to flirt still and I, shaken, ate the last of my tartufo, got\
  \ my bill, and never went back that way. \n\nI promised myself that Rome, though\
  \ beautiful, would be somewhere I never returned to. The day that I lost my innocence\
  \ is engraved in its walls and that, is something I will never fully recover from."
