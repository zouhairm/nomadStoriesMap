Text: "STANDING ON THE PAINTING PRINCIPLES\nBy Nyamagesa Laban.\n\n\nWe call it a\
  \ journey for a reason, because they will be hills and valleys. You may be required\
  \ to jump in a Daladala (public buses in Tanzania) or take a ride in a Bodaboda\
  \ (motorbike mostly used for transport) or you may have to take a bajaji (tricycle).\
  \ \n\nYou will be required to believe in yourself and trust that no matter what\
  \ happens, you will hold on to your journey and you wont let yourself down.\n\n\
  On route from Dar es salaam city to Moshi in Tanzania, I realized that traveling\
  \ gives you the greatest opportunities and the weirdest lessons, both teaches you\
  \ about who you are and what you can handle. \n\nIt was my first trip alone and\
  \ I wanted to try something new. I came a cross a gallery shop with paintings. \u201C\
  Will I be able to paint?\u201D.\n\nIn painting you may be required to concentrate,\
  \ imagining and then you can paint. It involves physical and internal attention,\
  \ I never thought of this, the last painting you paint reflects your thoughts. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t easy unless you are lucky enough to have Julie Limo a local painter\
  \ guiding you all the way. She is more than just a painter.\n\nJulie is an inspiration,\
  \ she uses her skills to make a living, paying her bills and take her children to\
  \ school, she is dedicated to help other young women who needs to achieve their\
  \ dreams. Through arts they have a chance to express their feelings as they paint\
  \ everyday. Painting gives them hope.\n\nI was scared holding a brush. But remembering\
  \ a quote from unknown writer kept me trying. \u201CWhen you take a rip of faith\
  \ and live a life of your dream, its is possible to have hope and courage.\u201D\
  \ While holding a brush you are required to control your brush, this is a first\
  \ skill that you learn as the painter, Julie showed me self control, \u201Cif you\
  \ think someone else controls your brush you will miss the picture you want to paint\u2019\
  .\n\nShe taught me how to blend colors, as you mix these colors you get what you\
  \ need. She used two colors to get other colors, I was amazed, never could i ever\
  \ think of using two colors and end up with different painting colors. Life can\
  \ be blended with anything. It taught me to use what I have to get what I need,\
  \ that i can be anything if I am willing to become. I was to stand on painting principles\
  \ at this moment.\n\nJulie taught me to draw the figure, and from my experience\
  \ , Julie showed me hope as she explained painting principles, her life if full\
  \ of hope, I learned to be hopeful as I draw my figure, (living)."
