Text: "And there we were, Herr (Mr.) Ressle and I, enjoying Brotzeit (meal time) from\
  \ atop the most breathtaking view I have ever seen. Snow was still hugging Timmelsjoch\
  \ pass and chilling our Weissbier as we ate bread, ham, and cheese for breakfast.\
  \ In one direction, you could see the Dolomites (a northeastern Italian mountain\
  \ range) piercing into the horizon; Austria beamed at us from the other. Sandwiched\
  \ between two countries, I shared sandwiches with a friend from a different generation.\
  \ But where did this story begin?\n\nIt all started about 1 month into my year abroad.\
  \ As I was walking to my bus stop for school, I saw an elderly Bavarian man in Lederhosen\
  \ approaching my path (this was not normal in my experience to date). The man made\
  \ a joke about my frail walking legs, I think. I laughed awkwardly as people do\
  \ when they are uncomfortable, and within the next 15 minutes managed to stumble\
  \ through my first German conversation with someone who truly spoke no English.\
  \ Before Herr Ressle was again on his way, he handed me a paper with his address\
  \ on it - a bit odd by millennial standards but nevertheless exciting. Fast forwarding\
  \ through the year: I stopped by his house, learned he was a world traveler who\
  \ had no e-mail, we kept in touch as pen pals after I moved cities, he invited me\
  \ to tour Europe, and at the end of my year abroad I took him up on the offer. \n\
  \nMy 5 day road trip with Herr Ressle, who was just shy of 70, took us from Bad\
  \ T\xF6lz, Germany through S\xFCdtirol, Italy. But it was there along the Timmelsjoch\
  \ High Alpine Road, the highest elevation of the eastern Alps, where my memory of\
  \ this adventure resides most fondly. Timmelsjoch pass is only open several months\
  \ out of the year due to its high elevation and windy dangerous roads. Had I known\
  \ my years end would involve stepping into what can only be described as a hybrid\
  \ of a blue truck and golf cart with an old man whose driving temperament is understated\
  \ as aggressive, I would have called Schwachsinn (BS). Herr Ressle merely wanted\
  \ to reciprocate the great hospitality he had received throughout his travels to\
  \ my home country. Although there were enough memories packed into those 1800 km\
  \ to last a year, it was the simple act of sharing a meal in a foreign climate with\
  \ a foreign friend that allowed me to never question the ending up of anywhere anymore.\
  \ And it was definitely the last thing I expected."
