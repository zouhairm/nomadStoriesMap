Text: "Coming from a country in the Eastern peninsula of Europe, I\u2019m used to\
  \ the puzzled faces when people get an answer to \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  . First I felt awkward when I heard \u201Coh Estonia, nice\u201D, \u201CMacedonia?\u201D\
  \ Then, all this ended up in laughter and endless zooming on Google maps each time.\
  \ It made me feel disconnected, yet the more I traveled the more I discovered how\
  \ my small, charming country is connected to the rest of the world.\n\nWhat\u2019\
  s the most viral thing that spreads easily, okay beside videos of cute baby pandas\
  \ rolling downslide? Food.\n\nThe first big AHA moment was seven years ago during\
  \ an intercultural night in my neighboring Bulgaria. When presenting my traditional\
  \ food, I realized it wasn\u2019t so special after all. Why did Romanians have a\
  \ similar thing to my Aivar, but called it Zakuska? I thought only Macedonians eat\
  \ delicious Aivar spread on bread with some white cheese on top. Cuika? No, that\u2019\
  s our strongest alcoholic drink, Rakia!\n\nFurious, moving on to the Turkish table\
  \ with all their delicious food presented, I see something familiar again. Ookay,\
  \ wait, is this intercultural or Macedonian night of food? Baklava and Kadaif? Turkish\
  \ delight with walnuts? But I thought that\u2019s\u2026 My utter confusion turned\
  \ into a wide smile after few glasses of the so-different-yet-the-same traditional\
  \ Rakia, and finally, over dessert, I understood that we all share the same specialties,\
  \ customs, words and phrases.\n\nTime Travel: Before I continue presenting myself\
  \ as the Macedonian Christopher Columbus discovering (or should I say recognizing)\
  \ food around the world, let me take you for a ride in my time machine a few centuries\
  \ back. You see, it all starts in the 13th century when the Ottoman Empire ruled\
  \ Southeastern Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa for hundreds of years.\
  \ This is when our customs and languages got beautifully mixed and spread all over.\
  \ Not to get too frenzy about history, but this left some cultural marks we cherish\
  \ 8 centuries after.\nBuckle up, we are going back to the future...\n\nFew years\
  \ passed and the nomad in me couldn\u2019t get enough of traveling. When the time\
  \ for the next continent came, my plane landed in Tunisia. I was so pumped up, turning\
  \ into Columbus again, discovering Africa this time, but little did I know, I will\
  \ be recognizing instead of discovering, AGAIN.\nThe food, the customs, some different,\
  \ some wonderfully similar, all taught me we are connected beyond borders and miles.\
  \ \n\nTravel. What a way to love the world."
