Text: "It had been a trying day. Teeth clacked as we bumped along the red dirt on\
  \ a five hour \u2018short-cut\u2019 through Morocco\u2019s Atlas Mountains. The\
  \ traitorous little blue line on my phone screen had lead us to a valley so narrow\
  \ and rutted only the hardiest of donkeys could manage it. Google maps had been\
  \ a bad idea, so had the rented Fiat Punto, but it was a bit late for those sorts\
  \ of regrets. With half a tank of gas, half a bag of fruit and a trickle of water\
  \ between three of us, turning back was hopeless. My gaze turned skyward to an unfinished\
  \ road heading deep into the mountains. \n\nWe stopped halfway up the first peak,\
  \ near a big red fuel tank, glistening in the sun like a jellybean. Shading our\
  \ eyes, we tried to decipher a way out. My head thudded with the familiar pain of\
  \ dehydration. I grabbed my half of an overripe banana, sweating in its plastic\
  \ bag. \n\n\u201CNo Ramadan?\u201D\n\nHe was short, beaming, and wearing a weathered\
  \ red cap. Where on earth had he come from? I tossed the sludgy remains of my banana\
  \ onto the passenger seat, embarrassed to have been caught stuffing my face at a\
  \ time of national abstinence from food. He chuckled and waved his hand dismissively,\
  \ then pointed to a small hut, no larger than a toolshed, perched on the edge of\
  \ the cliff.\n\n\u201CTea?\u201D\n\nHe walked us to his house, dragged out two tattered\
  \ sheets of cardboard for seats and brewed a pot of mint tea so sweet it burned\
  \ its way down my throat. He squatted, stirred and watched us drain back glass after\
  \ glass. We wiped our mouths and panted like dogs. The slightest of smiles was visible\
  \ from under his old cap. It would be another four hours until he could eat or drink\
  \ anything, but we had learned quickly that in Morocco you never turn down a cup\
  \ of tea. \n\nOur only shared language was bad miming, but as we sat and drank,\
  \ we learned his name was Said. He lived in his tiny house alone and guarded the\
  \ jellybean petrol tank which supplied the trucks building the road. He guessed\
  \ we were lost and etched out the way, a wrinkled finger making a map in the earth.\
  \ \n\nAs the heavy sun fell lower in the sky, we rooted around the car for something\
  \ to give Said in return for his kindness. Three ripe peaches, which he took with\
  \ another of his wide grins. Did he understand just how much he had helped us? It\
  \ was hard to say.  \n\nWith some vigorous waving and honks that echoed across the\
  \ valley, we set off again on our upward climb. It would be another seven hours\
  \ until we reached civilisation - exhausted, but content."
