Text: "\u201CWhat do you need, miss?\u201D I look up to see a warm and heartfelt Fijian\
  \ smile. \nI need to sew a newly acquired patch onto my travel sack. \u201CNeedle\
  \ and thread please,\" I responded, wondering how she knew I needed anything. \n\
  \u201COk, I go home to get.\u201D Before I can object, she walks away.  I remain\
  \ put. \n \u201CFijians appear to know me better than I know myself\u201D I think\
  \ to myself and like that before I get to finish the thought; I get approached by\
  \ a local young man. \n\u201CNi Sa Bula, hello miss you want to kayak with me today?\u201D\
  \ His eyes are consistent with that of the other islanders, full of light, warmth,\
  \ and depth. \n\u201CBut of course.\u201D \n\nUnder the palmy canopy, the young\
  \ man pulls out two large yellow ocean kayaks and we set off to circle a neighboring\
  \ island. I can\u2019t decide whether I\u2019m more intrigued by the cliff side\
  \ or if I want to stick my feet on this pristine and barely touched ground. Either\
  \ way, I want explore the island. I point to the island and shout to the Fijian\
  \ \"explore kerekere!\"\n\nThe sea is calm today so I'm surprised when a huge wave\
  \ comes out of nowhere and lifts my kayak up just as I am getting out.  The wave\
  \ sends the kayak hurling directly into the bony part of my ankle. \n\nIn less than\
  \ a second, the pain rips through me like I have never known. Screaming, hollering,\
  \ I am loosely letting out a string of profanities.  I have never felt so much pain.\
  \ Death must be better than this, I thought.  I can hear myself overreacting and\
  \ yet I can\u2019t seem to regain any sense of peace over the pain. \"Please miss,\
  \ sit down\" the young man urges me.  Biting my own arm I sit, trying to hold back\
  \ the tears that are welling inside me. \nThe Fijian takes a hold of my ankle. He\
  \ holds it with pressure similar to that you would use holding a dove. I watch him.\
  \ He's starting to sweat. As the sweat pours down his face my ankle numbs. Within\
  \ 2 minutes I feel nothing.\nAll pain has entirely subsided. Confused and amazed\
  \ as to what just happened, we continued to explore the island.\nTo this day I have\
  \ no issues with my right ankle bone. I did however, come out with a new perspective.\n\
  \nIn Fiji, medicine comes largely from healers. These people are sought out often\
  \ from a young age and possess the ability to heal with their hands.\nI later discovered\
  \ a young 8 year old girl who passed out twice healing a man with 3rd degree burns.\
  \ She sat there for 3 days with him as she absorbed the heat into her own body.\
  \  They both survived."
