Text: "It can be tricky, as a foreigner abroad, to find the beating heart of local\
  \ life. After a month in Northern India I was more than desperate to leave the tourist\
  \ trail behind. I had found it an overwhelmingly exciting place in so many ways;\
  \ but the chaos, the vastness and inescapable hustle, made it difficult to pierce\
  \ the colourful exterior of this multi-layered country for real depth of understanding.\
  \ I was ready for something different. I had become more interested in insight than\
  \ sightseeing.\n\nSo I was lucky when I took a tip to visit Munroe Island in Southern\
  \ India\u2019s Kerala. The family-home of our host, the warm, wonderful Vijeesh,\
  \ was populated by a handful of other tourists looking for something extraordinary\
  \ in the ordinary - and that\u2019s certainly what we got. We were offered cuddles\
  \ with the newly-born addition to the family, marvelling at her tiny month-old pierced\
  \ ears and kohl-rimmed eyes. We were shown the wild pineapples, peppercorns, ginger\
  \ and turmeric Vijeesh would pick for his mother to cook and serve to us on banana\
  \ leaves. We were introduced to the women working in the local cashew factory, and\
  \ the cotton-spinning machine invented by Gandhi. We drank fresh, spicy chai in\
  \ his coconut-bark canoe; and sat on his roof surrounded by waterways, spotting\
  \ herons, hawks and monkeys.\n\nOf course, people\u2019s lives are complicated and\
  \ scratching the surface can reveal a darker side. Under the palms on one of our\
  \ foraging walks conversation took a different turn. Vijeesh had welcomed so many\
  \ people of different nationalities and was bursting to experience life outside\
  \ his homeland. Visa applications - a long, expensive process involving many forms,\
  \ days of travel and intensive interviews - had been unsuccessful. On the second\
  \ occasion he had a sponsorship letter from an American friend whose wedding he\
  \ was desperate to attend: this rejection hurt the most. He'd struggle to raise\
  \ funds to apply again and wasn\u2019t sure he could bear further disappointment.\
  \ The sense of being trapped without any avenue for adventure made him feel claustrophobic.\
  \ He was unsure of his next move.\n\nSensing our astonishment at this injustice\
  \ Vijeesh became upbeat again. Touched by his positivity and energy, we hoped beyond\
  \ anything he would find a way to fulfil his dreams one day. Until then his experience\
  \ of other cultures came from the travellers he shared his life with in such a heartfelt\
  \ way. Travellers that left with a deeper understanding of the complexities of real\
  \ Indian life, and a true sense of connection."
