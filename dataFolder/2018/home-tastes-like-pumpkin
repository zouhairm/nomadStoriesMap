Text: "It\u2019s monsoon season in Korea and Seoul has become a lake.\n\nI race home\
  \ from the subway through the pelting rain, leaping over the deeper puddles and\
  \ splashing through the rest, clothes soaked through and backpack held over my head\
  \ in vain.\n\nThe sky and the city have both turned the same sullen grey. Even the\
  \ neon signs have a drowned look. I almost dash right past my tiny apartment building,\
  \ its narrow entrance just a dark smudge in a wall of rain-washed brick.\n\nI have\
  \ the door yanked halfway open before I realize someone is calling me.\n\n\u201C\
  \uC544\uAC00\uC528!\u201D the voice calls again. \u201CMiss!\u201D\n\nThere\u2019\
  s an elderly Korean woman standing just a few feet away. In my rush to get inside,\
  \ I hadn\u2019t even realized she was there.\n\nI reluctantly step out from under\
  \ the building\u2019s overhang, back into the downpour, and her eyebrows shoot up\
  \ in surprise. \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re a foreigner!\u201D she exclaims in Korean.\n\
  \nI nod, baffled.\n\nShe\u2019s dressed in a wild mishmash of colours and patterns\
  \ with no umbrella in sight. Her fine white hair is plastered to her head, the rain\
  \ carving its way through the wrinkles on her face like rivers through stone.\n\n\
  She speaks again in her rolling provincial dialect, too quickly for me to understand.\
  \ I\u2019m itching to get inside and dry off but my sense of Korean propriety\u2014\
  finely-tuned after nearly three years living in Seoul\u2014won\u2019t let me budge.\n\
  \nNoticing my confusion, the old woman smiles and holds out her hand. I realize\
  \ suddenly that she\u2019s carrying a small Styrofoam takeaway container.\n\n\u201C\
  Take it!\u201D she urges.\n\nI accept the gift automatically with both hands and\
  \ thank her.\n\nBefore I can say anything else, she pats my shoulder in a grandmotherly\
  \ way and wanders off.\n\nThe Styrofoam container is waiting for me on the counter\
  \ when I emerge from the shower twenty minutes later, still warm to the touch. I\
  \ open the lid and inhale fragrant steam\u2014\uD638\uBC15\uC8FD, creamy pumpkin\
  \ porridge. It looks homemade.\n\nI grab a spoon and take a tentative bite. It\u2019\
  s silky, earthy, and mildly sweet. Just the thing for a rainy day.\n\nAs I dig into\
  \ the porridge in earnest, I reflect on my unexpected encounter with the old woman.\
  \ I had been having a horrible day before I met her\u2014late to work, misbehaving\
  \ students, bad news from home\u2014but now, with each spoonful, I can feel that\
  \ tension melting away.\n\nThe simple kindness of the gesture wraps around me like\
  \ a blanket, warm and comforting. Cocooned in my tiny apartment, oceans away from\
  \ the place I was born, I'm reminded once again that I'm home."
