Text: "Even without their costumes, you could tell them by the way they were treated:\
  \ like guests of honour, yet totally aloof, prone, at any given moment, to the mopey\
  \ silence of teenagers worldwide. Sleeping, texting. And while they never took off\
  \ the red bandanas that signified their heritage, rather than tie them neatly, they\u2019\
  d pull them up to their sunglasses, baseball hats, hoodies. LA Lakers, SF Giants.\
  \ Next to them their horsehair masks, abalone necklaces and butterfly-cocoon leggings\
  \ would lay perfectly folded. The Yoreme pajko\u2019ora dancers were, in every respect,\
  \ the bad boys of the spiritual circuit; the Pete Dohertys of the camino rojo. And\
  \ I was about to meet heir guardian. \n\n\u201CWhat up, guey?\u201D the guardian,\
  \ who looked like Genghis Khan and therefore had attracted the nickname El Mong\xF3\
  l, said as we arrived at his small, rectangular house in the middle of a wind-blown\
  \ desert. We\u2019d driven three hours to find him, and the moonlight gave his garden\
  \ an eerie shine as we sat down to a ballena, or \u201Cwhale:\u201D the one-litre\
  \ bottles of beer favoured by the Sinaloans.\n\n\u201CWe want you to dance at our\
  \ gathering,\u201D my host said. \u201CWith the Aztec.\u201D \n\nEl Mong\xF3l grunted.\
  \ \u201CI have to ask Tonantzin.\u201D He headed inside and opened a door, revealing\
  \ a new part of the house, equal in size to that hosting his wife, three kids, dog\
  \ and two cats. All one big room, it was a dedication to El Virg\xE9n de Guadalupe,\
  \ or Tonantzin, as El Mongol, versed in Christian as indigenous tradition, had referred\
  \ to his matron saint. Seven figurines, an altar of flowers, prayer letters, more\
  \ candles than I could count. And a drawing of El Mong\xF3l\u2019s car, with the\
  \ handwritten note, \u201CI wont to sell it.\u201D \n\nMy host took a swig of beer\
  \ and listened to the wind picking up outside our terrace. A swathe of sand landed\
  \ on the white plastic table, as if thrown by an angry neighbour. \n\n\u201CSometimes\
  \ we dance for three days,\u201D El Mongol said, still kneeling. \u201CMy boys.\
  \ You should hear them afterwards. Trying to sleep, their muscles spasming. Aw!\
  \ Ow! Ouch!\u201D He held his belly with laughter. \u201C\u2019Ssh!\u2019 one of\
  \ my boys said last night, \u201CGo to sleep and you won\u2019t feel the pain.\u201D\
  \ He gasped for air, and we waited for his breath to return.\n\n\u201CSo,\u201D\
  \ my host said finally. \u201CWhat did she say?\u201D\nEl Mong\xF3l smiled, got\
  \ up, and took a last swig from the ballena.\n \u201COf course we\u2019re dancing,\u201D\
  \ he said and winked at me. \u201CI just wanted to give guera here her peso\u2019\
  s worth. Entertainment, you see, doesn\u2019t stop at the dance floor.\u201D"
