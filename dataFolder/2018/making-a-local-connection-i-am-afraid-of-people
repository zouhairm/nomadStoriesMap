Text: "Making a local connection? - I am afraid of people!\nI know that if you are\
  \ traveler with big backpack, great beard (or not if you are a woman!), tent, a\
  \ good shape and whole this regular travelers stuff. You are eco, vege, bio etc.\
  \ you have to love people! Hmm.. and I have a problem with this case. \nYes, I can\
  \ say that I am Sunday-Traveler and I do not like people. I really do not know why\
  \ because I met a lot of people and I was living with them, but I need to work with\
  \ myself every time. I know that is insane, but I would like to tell you how to\
  \ travel with such a disorder. \n1. I travel much more! Especially with people what\
  \ I do not know. In every trip we have new person and sometimes whole travel team\
  \ is new. That is awesome!\n2. I cancelled all inclusive from my dictionary.\n3.\
  \ Choose Hostel than Hotel when you travel abroad (alone especially) because of\
  \ this amazing living room where every things are happened.\n4. The people who are\
  \ traveling they are more than happy! We can join a conversation with stranger.\
  \ There do not be shy - share your plans for the day. \n5. Who we can meet in hostels\
  \ during our travel? People young and old, families, groups and solo travelers.\
  \ I give everyone a chance.\n6. In the poor places people are more happy and honest\
  \ \u2013 I prefer these destinations. I love when somebody has a big beautiful simile\
  \ in his faces.\n7. Share a food but you don\u2019t have to offer to share yours.\
  \ People are social beings. To walk up to a complete stranger can be a bit nerve-racking\
  \ at first, but I have never been turned down by someone else who is eating alone.\
  \ If I am looking for local dining experience I ask or invite local people. That\
  \ will help me meet other locals people or more travelers. I have had luck meeting\
  \ people by just asking to sit with them at lunch or dinner \n8. It is true that\
  \ in our travel we will probably never see all these people again. That is what\
  \ it makes me brave about people.\n9. I am learning local language and the lingo.\
  \ \n10. It is necessary to be flexible with ours plans \u2013 we can meet somebody\
  \ who can change everything what we wanted to do. \n11. Wherever I go, I try find\
  \ cheap trinkets at souvenir polish shops. I always make sure to pick up a couple\
  \ of interesting ones like magnets, drinks, t-shirts or anything that is not heavy.\
  \ It is good souvenir for people which I like during the travel."
