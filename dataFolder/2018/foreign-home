Text: "My train arrived in Lyon on a stormy evening. No light managed to escape through\
  \ the numerous clouds and thick fog encompassing my surroundings. The cold breeze\
  \ kissed my skin as its coolness seeped into my veins, sending chills through my\
  \ body like an electric current. Unfortunately, my mapped directions to my hotel\
  \ were no match for the violent rain falling from above, and I was left with nowhere\
  \ to go. I started jogging with the hope to find a shelter. I gazed at the magnificent\
  \ buildings around me as I ran by them. Each of them had their own distinct personality.\
  \ Some were dressed in sculptures and gargoyles, while others\u2019 attraction lied\
  \ in their intricate mosaic exterior. About a ten-minute journey North, I found\
  \ my sanctuary: a crowded bar with an undecipherable name. I walked in. At first\
  \ glance, my eyes were overwhelmed by all the sights to focus on. I noticed singing\
  \ and dancing in one corner, drinking and snacking in another, and dispersed everywhere\
  \ were multiple groups of people attempting to talk over the loud roar of the crowd.\
  \ Then, I redirected my eyes, looking at every section individually. I listened\
  \ to a strange, yet pleasant song, meanwhile observing the skilful dance moves coming\
  \ from a young couple. Subsequently, my focus was drawn to a vehement debate between\
  \ an older group of friends discussing a subject that I was completely ignorant\
  \ to. I listened to all the different arguments and was fascinated by the passion\
  \ found in the voices of these individuals that were defending a topic that had\
  \ never crossed my mind. I was deeply invested in the discussion when a hand tapped\
  \ my shoulder. It was a group of young adults. With a friendly tone in their voice,\
  \ they invited me to dance with them. Before my brain could process what I was doing,\
  \ I accepted their offer. \nEverything around me was new: unknown faces, unfamiliar\
  \ accents, different cultural idiosyncrasies\u2026 For once, everything was out\
  \ of my hands, and I could truly open my mind to the world unravelling before me.\
  \ For someone with a taste for organization and control, it was an alien feeling,\
  \ but somehow, I loved it. It was the last thing that I would have expected, yet\
  \ my uncharted surroundings had become my new foreign home. As I was pondering my\
  \ thoughts and trying to decode my emotions\u2014as I usually do\u2014I came across\
  \ a quote printed on a small piece of magazine paper stuck onto the wall. In warm-coloured\
  \ letters it read \u201CSe perdre pour mieux se trouver.\u201D And I finally understood\u2026"
