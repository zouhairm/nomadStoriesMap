Text: "May 2017,\n\nIt is an understatement to say that British Columbia is as beautiful\
  \ as they say. It is also an understatement to say Tyler had no clue what he was\
  \ getting himself into.\n\nMy boyfriend (Tyler) and I had freshly turned eighteen.\
  \ This meant we were finally old enough to leave the province and fly away from\
  \ the nest on our own. We were free to make our own choices; from the adventures\
  \ we wanted to follow to the sights we wanted to see. The first choice we made was\
  \ British Columbia, Vancouver to be more specific. After some debate, we finally\
  \ agreed BC would touch on both our interests. He was looking for an adventure filled\
  \ week, whereas I was looking for a connection with nature and the beautiful greenery.\
  \ We were both looking for the one thing to make this trip special above all others\
  \ and to expand our horizons. It was our first day in British Columbia and we had\
  \ successfully done just that. We took our goals for the trip to all new heights.\n\
  \ \nDriving along the Trans Canada highway, overwhelmed with joy as we crossed the\
  \ Alberta/British Columbia border, we passed a sign that read \u201CSky Dive in\
  \ Beautiful BC\u201D. Immediately Tyler laughed and said, out of confidence that\
  \ I would say no, \u201Clet\u2019s do it\u201D. It came as quite a surprise when\
  \ I said \u201Cokay\u201D. I could feel the fear resting on his face. Don\u2019\
  t get me wrong, I\u2019m not one to usually jump out of a perfectly good aeroplane,\
  \ but I\u2019m also not one to miss an opportunity. Tyler, on the other hand has\
  \ the biggest fear of heights, but with some convincing and a lot of begging, he\
  \ agreed to jump. The next morning we set out to free fall.\n\nOur hearts raced\
  \ with adrenaline as the wheels of the rickety, 3-seater plane took off into the\
  \ baby blue sky. I had seen skylines before but never one like this; I had never\
  \ seen mountains lining the horizon and green pouring from every way I looked, making\
  \ me dizzy trying to see it all, and I had definitely never felt the powerful wind\
  \ hit my face so aggressively. Through all of our terror and excitement we jumped,\
  \ and seconds later the wind wasn't so mean, and the sky wasn\u2019t spinning. It\
  \ was calm, breath taking and beautiful. Although, it ended all too shortly a few\
  \ minutes later as our feet reunited with the ground, it was the connection and\
  \ thrill we were so eager to find. We did not know it at the time but that fall\
  \ was the reason we went on the trip, and that rush, the beautiful peace within\
  \ as we landed on the grass will forever be in my thoughts."
