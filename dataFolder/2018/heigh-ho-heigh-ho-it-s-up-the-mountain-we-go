Text: "We made it to EBC (Everest Base Camp) Day 9 of our trek. Dora the explorer\
  \ and Diego walked 62kms to stand here at 5364 metres above sea level. A big bucket\
  \ list item reached.\nI had no idea what Everest would look like and the thought\
  \ of seeing it with my own eyes had always been a young Dora's dream. You don\u2019\
  t have to wait long as day two you see her in the far distance standing tall at\
  \ 8848m.\nThe stairs are relentless hence I made up a song to sing to myself and\
  \ anyone else who would listen. Heigh-Ho-Heigh-Ho-It\u2019s up the mountain we go-Heigh-Ho-Heigh-Ho-It\u2019\
  s up the stairs we go. And another was -I love stairs-I love stairs-Long ones-Short\
  \ ones-I love stairs-I love stairs-I love stairs-Steep one-Small ones-I love stairs.\n\
  Back to day 9 and getting to EBC, no more making up silly tunes, as at high altitudes\
  \ thinking is hard to do let alone trying to co-ordinate one\u2019s feet one foot\
  \ in front of another. I\u2019ve felt -20 before in a ski village in Germany and\
  \ that was like warm apple pie just of the oven compared to this final push to base\
  \ camp. I\u2019m one of those people that needs a cardigan on a summer evening so\
  \ I was nuts coming to this region in Dec, Jan the winter season due to better visibility.\
  \ Yes, Dora wanted a clear selfie with Everest to put on Instragram of course.\n\
  The wind is gushing past us and despite wearing a million layers Dora couldn\u2019\
  t keep warm.\nTo tell you more I have to go back to go forward, a bit like this\
  \ story so far. Dora\u2019s father got told that he had Stage 4 cancer. He fought\
  \ back to Dr\u2019s surprise and was near the magic word \u2018Remission\u2019.\
  \ My partner in an effort to cheer me up asked \u2018what is country 54 on your\
  \ list of 80 will you visit next?\u2019 I rattled off many countries without a breath\
  \ in between and before you know it we are talking about Nepal and Dora\u2019s want\
  \ to walk the EBC trek. My dad\u2019s brother had been twice but my dad never made\
  \ it though he would have liked to if younger. \nFast forward 6 months from Dora\u2019\
  s father\u2019s diagnoses he had passed. The idea to take my dad\u2019s ashes to\
  \ EBC came.\nBack to day 9, already 6 hours into walking exhausted and freezing.\
  \ My guide took my bag to help me, the stairs kept coming. My song I made up was\
  \ now to tiring to sing. I couldn\u2019t even think. We see pray flags, lots of\
  \ them. We are finally at base camp, suddenly I find the energy to climb the rocks\
  \ to tie a pray flag up and poured dad\u2019s ashes over the rocks. I looked up\
  \ at the blue sky and all the mountains, cried and smile. Bitter sweet moments."
