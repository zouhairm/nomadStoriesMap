Text: "I was in S\xE3o Paulo to make a film on street art and had organised to meet\
  \ an artist, Thiago Ritual, who would show me the street art in his hometown Graja\xFA\
  . As we made our way from the city centre on two trains and a bus, I carried my\
  \ backpack full of film gear on my front. Thiago laughed at me, \u201CStop carrying\
  \ your bag that way, it looks like you have something to steal! It\u2019s cool,\
  \ you\u2019re with a local.\u201D Our train rounded a corner and thousands of makeshift\
  \ homes spread to the horizon, their blue tarp roofs held down by corrugated iron.\
  \ Graja\xFA is known as a \u2018favela\u2019, which are the poorer neighbourhoods\
  \ in Brazil, but it was nothing like the depictions of favelas run by gangs in movies\
  \ such as \u2018City of God.\u2019 \n\nThiago took me to a community centre that\
  \ held exhibitions and art classes for children. The front of the centre had been\
  \ painted with intricate patterns of intertwining leaves, with electric pops of\
  \ colour. Thiago proudly stated that was his graffiti. His friends greeted us and\
  \ we attempted to exchange stories, aided by Thiago\u2019s translations. We were\
  \ four hours into the street art tour, and I was yet to see street art.\n\nWe stopped\
  \ by a small shop where owner sold cacha\xE7a, a potent spirit made from sugarcane\
  \ juice. Despite my usual appreciation about accepting random homebrew, a \u2018\
  stay present\u2019 voice within me gave a gentle nudge and my throat soon burned\
  \ with the strong alcohol. I was feeling light-headed, perhaps from the morning\
  \ of trekking in 30-degree heat, but probably from the questionable liquor.\n\n\
  By the time we got to Thiago\u2019s studio, I had almost forgotten about street\
  \ art. Artwork covered the interior and exterior of this space. I got on with my\
  \ interview for my film. I finally got the incredible street art tour. We went up\
  \ to the roof of Thiago's studio, where there was a view of the whole favela. I\
  \ listened to the sounds of life around me. Families listened to music, children\
  \ were on rooftops kite fighting. I began to get the sense that this wasn\u2019\
  t just a place I was visiting but a place full of life where families grew, artists\
  \ created and people got by on very little. Snapping me out of my thoughts, thunder\
  \ cracked right above us and lightning hit the trees across the road. Then it bucketed\
  \ down with rain. Everything about that day was unpredictable. It struck me how\
  \ different that day would have gone had I not been with Thiago. The detours, the\
  \ people I met had nothing to do with my documentary yet had everything to do with\
  \ my documentary."
