Text: "My semester \u201Cabroad\u201D didn't take me far from home. I went from Cologne,\
  \ Germany, to the capital of The Netherlands. I've been learning Dutch for a couple\
  \ of semesters and felt ready to go. How unfamiliar Amsterdam really was only dawned\
  \ on me after the first month living there. I tried to throw myself into the Dutch\
  \ life and practise my conversational skills \u2013 but no one wanted to speak Dutch\
  \ with me. My courses in the University were international ones, so English it was.\
  \ My fellow students only spoke English with each other \u2013 no luck here. When\
  \ I was asked for directions on the street in Dutch by Dutch people, I answered\
  \ in my best Dutch but got a reply in German. I was devastated. The Dutch people\
  \ seemed to love their language skills and after many moments of polite language\
  \ judo, I got the feeling that the Dutch deeply mistrust anyone who wants to learn\
  \ their mother tongue. What for? The shrugs and lifted eyebrows said to me. Finally\
  \ giving up hope to practise my language skills in everyday life, I looked for a\
  \ tandem partner - and I found one. A guy in his early thirties replied to my notice\
  \ I pinned on the walls of the university. \nSo I had my first real opportunity\
  \ to talk Dutch. We agreed to go for walk for an hour. Thirty minutes of speaking\
  \ Dutch, thirty minutes of German. We walked through the Vondelpark and back to\
  \ the canals. He was nice and interested, my Dutch skills were far worse then I\
  \ thought and his German was very good \u2013 of course. But my language knight\
  \ in German armour changed during the walk. He became a bit nervous, grew more and\
  \ more pale and finally started sweating in the rather chilly spring weather. I\
  \ asked him what was up and he confessed he felt a bit sick but he'd be fine. Unfortunately\
  \ the sweating and the paleness multiplied and he started walking funny. Finally\
  \ he darted into one of the public restrooms right around the Torture Museum. It\
  \ was one of these urinals that have no doors, only walls, that are positioned in\
  \ a way that from the wrong angle you see just a little too much. Of course the\
  \ angle, I stood there waiting in, was bad and I got the full view. The poor guy\
  \ was sick from more then one possible opening of his body. I couldn't turn away\
  \ in time to prevent us both from getting to know each other much more intimately\
  \ then we wanted to. In that moment I finally was speechless."
