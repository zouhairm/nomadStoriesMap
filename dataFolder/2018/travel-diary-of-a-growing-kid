Text: "Finishing up my college I was very eager to travel because I knew travel soothes\
  \ the mind and opens up new possibilities. My friend told me he was going to Kerala\
  \ for a distant-relative marriage and he asked me to join over. So we finished writing\
  \ our last exam and left for Kempegowda Railway Station, which is one of the central\
  \ hubs in the souths. Our train was scheduled to depart from Platform No 8 but to\
  \ our surprise, we had a tough time reaching there. Not to the station but to the\
  \ platform. We reached platform 6, we could see platform 7 but there was no view\
  \ of platform 8. Almost like a scene from Hogwarts. Because there were no platforms\
  \ after 7 \u2013 a dead end. So I finally saw a passage giving way to the other\
  \ side of a platform. And voila, there it was \u2013 Platform no 8!\n\nThe train\
  \ was packed so we sat by the gates, feet dangling, and our journey began. In the\
  \ morning when I woke up, I found myself in a huge tunnel which ended into a beautiful,\
  \ majestic, heavenly view of most saturated trees I\u2019ve ever seen in my life.\
  \ My first word when our train entered the state of Kerala was, \u2018Wow\u2019\
  \ was my first. Breathtaking views of clear beaches fading into the Arabian Sea.\
  \ So we finally arrived at this small station called Kasaragod from where again\
  \ we had to take a bus to this small village, Padane, our destination. Small in\
  \ size but full of people, this village had its own vibe.\n\nI had fish fry (yup,\
  \ Indian way of saying things) fried in coconut oil, with sour cream, lemon, and\
  \ parsley sprinkled on it, for breakfast and then we left to explore in my friend\u2019\
  s uncle\u2019s old rusty scooter which made a sound which was inversely proportional\
  \ to its speed. We went to see the huge abandoned house where my friend used to\
  \ play as a kid and met his \u2018remember that day\u2019 friends there. South Indian\
  \ marriages and celebration styles are little different from how we do up north.\
  \ When I arrived at the marriage to greet the bride and groom, I decided something\
  \ that day. I wanna see the different cultures and traditions of the world and talk\
  \ to people. The way people were talking among themselves and the couple seemed\
  \ so content, kids running around, the whole atmosphere was almost picturesque.\
  \ I wanted to document every little thing \u2013 people and their emotions, tradition\
  \ and the colors, place and its peculiarities.\n\nThe last thing I expected was\
  \ that this small trip would change me as a person. Since that day I started seeing\
  \ things differently whenever I travel."
