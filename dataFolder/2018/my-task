Text: "I m Raman from India . I m struggling to achieve my goals . I m unemployed\
  \ with almost no support . Since childhood I was interested in traveling . I use\
  \ to watch TV so from there I got inspired to travel the world . My family never\
  \ supported me for traveling but I m stubborn to travel & I do .\n\nI made many\
  \ small & big trip to many tourist places of Indian . I made excuses to my family\
  \ to travel .\n\nI TRAVEL WITH ALMOST NO MONEY !\n\nIn 2016/ mid June, I started\
  \ my two months trip to Delhi, Gurgaon, Noida & Manali . Where I use to beg, borrow\
  \ & steel to survive . I tried to earn money . I got hired & fired from many work\
  \ places . I use to convene stranger to pay bills for my restaurant & cafe meal\
  \ . For accommodation I use to stay in some strange people houses by convenience\
  \ them . For internet use I randomly approach strangers to use their cell phones\
  \ & laptops . I also took advantage of Bangla Sahib Gurudwara for free eatery &\
  \ temporary stay . I also stayed in bus terminal . I enjoyed food & drinks for free\
  \ . Then after Delhi NCR trip I went to Manali . It's a hill station in Himalayan\
  \ mountain range . There also I was staying with strangers in there cottage for\
  \ free & I return they asked me for help in their work . Later on they annoyed me\
  \ seriously & I ended up my Manali trip with big issues in Sept/2016 .\n\nIn 2017,\
