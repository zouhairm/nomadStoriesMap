Text: "I loved her; I found the connection, yet, I told her NO!\n\nAs I packed my\
  \ things, I felt there were more than one purposes to why I was traveling. I had\
  \ been lost in my peace campaign in Nigeria that I forgot what mama usually refers\
  \ to as the essential thing in life; love. Her philosophy; \u2018find a lady close\
  \ to your heart, someone, who would help you stay strong, then grow together with\
  \ her\u2019. I was going to Nairobi to represent Nigeria for the Africa Peace Summit.\n\
  \nThe airport was lit with streams of fluorescence, large fluorescence I had never\
  \ seen before; all my peace campaign had been in my country, Nigeria; there were\
  \ enough conflicts in my state to keep me busy from ever looking out. With this\
  \ conference, I could see an airport and how the inside looks; I could also see\
  \ the lips of the air hostesses, curvy and inviting; how they smile even when it\
  \ is not convenient. I would confirm also, the myth that says all pilots were whites\
  \ and blacks were not smart enough to fly planes. I wasn\u2019t disappointed.\n\n\
  I was welcomed by a white lady when I arrived Nairobi; she was calm, short legged\
  \ and her smile was brisk, exposing a little portion of her incisors. She had a\
  \ tiny blue pen strapped to her chest; I guessed it was to help tick the name of\
  \ the delegates who arrive through this airport. I wasn\u2019t disappointed either.\n\
  \nAfrica is a place with lots of opportunities and disappointments, and only with\
  \ careful consideration, you could pick out the wheat from the chaffs. Mama would\
  \ say these words as she passed the Mug with hot tea to every one of us. I would\
  \ sip little from the colored content and then give it to Charlie.\n\nIn Nairobi,\
  \ the roads were wide, smooth and had traffic lights. This must be some part of\
  \ Europe; Africa is perceived as just too backward to have things this organized.\
  \ Their power supply was never interrupted all through my stay, the vehicles obeyed\
  \ the traffic lights, and unlike Nigeria, the police smiled at you and asked if\
  \ you needed any help.\n\nI thought I should culture a relationship with this place;\
  \ come here for an education, or vacation. Maybe, bring my peace campaigns here;\
  \ after all, they had their general elections coming up soon. Mama would be pleased\
  \ with me; it would make her call me her true son, just like she did Charlie. Charlie\
  \ had gone to South Africa to practice as a Medical Doctor. \n\nBut I had to stay\
  \ true to my country; and even if I had this connection with Nairobi, I still told\
  \ her NO."
