Text: "Our taxi rattled. Rural scenery was passing quicker than before. Groans sounded\
  \ from the engine as the car struggled with acceleration.\n\u201CQu\u2019est-ce\
  \ que tu fait!?\u201D I demanded of the driver. He didn\u2019t respond, his grip\
  \ tightening on the steering wheel.  \nWe began driving on the wrong side, overtaking\
  \ vehicles. As oncoming cars and motorbikes appeared, he weaved back. Drivers beeped\
  \ and screamed out their windows. \n\u201CImb\xE9cile!\u201D\nI wondered how the\
  \ seat in front of me would take the impact of my body. The car had no seatbelts.\
  \ Looking over my shoulder, I saw we were being chased by a police car and a policeman\
  \ on a motorbike.\nThe police car caught up, its driver bellowing at us to pull\
  \ over. Instead, we swerved left, aiming for him, attempting to ram him off the\
  \ road. Both cars collided. The police car reduced its speed and fell behind, the\
  \ metal of both vehicles screeching as they separated. \nNext, the policeman on\
  \ the motorbike pulled up, waving his arm. Once again, my driver attempted to ram\
  \ the vehicle, but the police man pulled back in time. I offered my driver all the\
  \ money I had on me to stop. It was too late. Accepting meant being arrested. There\
  \ seemed to be no way out.\nI felt my insides tremble.\nUp ahead, stationary cars\
  \ spread across the road. A large tractor was attempting a three-point turn. This\
  \ is it, I thought. \nThe blockade grew nearer. I braced for impact. Then, my driver\
  \ swerved right. We began tearing along the dust path separating the road from adjacent\
  \ fields. The driver whipped the car sideways, back onto the road, hoping to avoid\
  \ a collision with the tractor. He was too slow. \nThe driver\u2019s side of the\
  \ car hit the tractor\u2019s tire, ripping off the wing mirror, smashing the windscreen,\
  \ and putting a large dent in the rear passenger door. We came to a stop. \nHaving\
  \ braced myself for impact, I was O.K. It was over. But then, the driver accelerated\
  \ again.\nHowever, the collision had damaged our car so much that we barely moved.\
  \ Realising that we couldn\u2019t get much further, the driver turned off the road\
  \ and we rolled towards a cluster of houses. We moved so slow that I swung open\
  \ my door and jumped out, stumbling as the car came to a halt. \nThe driver burst\
  \ his door open, and fell out of the car, holding his arm. With a limp, he ran towards\
  \ the nearby fields and was swallowed by the green foliage.\nShouts grew louder,\
  \ closer, as did the rumble of hurried feet. I felt a hand on my back and turned\
  \ around to see the police man from the motor bike."
