Text: "After two months of relentless travel through Thailand and Laos, I was screaming\
  \ for some bi-pedal transportation. Trekking was the answer. While most people were\
  \ hiking well known routes in Thailand and Vietnam, my partner Steve and I chose\
  \ northern Laos. We were about to learn why many stick to the path well trodden.\n\
  \ \nDays later, we found ourselves trekking behind Pit, our very fit twentysomething\
  \ guide. The 35\xB0C heat was excruciating. The sky was cloudless, the sun unforgiving.\
  \ We hiked through relentless jungle, navigating unstable, invisible paths. Our\
  \ respite for night one was a big open hut in the middle of nowhere. There was a\
  \ wooden floor to sleep on and a bamboo roof overhead, both of which were covered\
  \ with flies. The next morning, we awoke to a loud drone. Swarms of bees were doing\
  \ laps around our flimsy mosquito nets.\n\nTrekking on day two was even more treacherous.\
  \ To add to our stress, there were leeches everywhere, crawling up our boots and\
  \ pants, even sliding up our walking sticks to get to our hands.  Steve had leeches\
  \ stuck to his calves with gobs of blood running down his legs. I took off my blood-filled\
  \ boot to find a leech had worked its way into my sock and attached itself to my\
  \ toe. \n\nOur pit stop for night two was a bamboo slatted floor and roof, both\
  \ with more holes than bamboo, and of course, flies. Trying to take a rest before\
  \ dinner, Steve lay down in the hut. In minutes, he was covered in blood. Steve\
  \ had been violated by a leech in the last place you want that to happen; in his\
  \ area of exit. We ate dinner standing up that night, obsessively inspecting ourselves\
  \ and constantly brushing things away. \n\nIt was now our final day of the trek.\
  \ We again woke to the sound of bees. This time, they were five times the size of\
  \ the morning before and even more aggressive. Steve is allergic to bees. He got\
  \ stung on the chin before he even made it out of his mosquito net. First violated\
  \ by a leech, only to be followed by surviving a bee allergy in the middle of the\
  \ Laos jungle.\n\nEvery step forward was one step closer to getting out. Although\
  \ we had been guaranteed there would be enough water, we had now run out. We were\
  \ completely dehydrated. At the end, some random children appeared out of nowhere.\
  \ They herded us into a canoe and paddled us across a creek over to a beach. The\
  \ tour company truck was waiting to whisk us back into town. We had made it. \n\n\
  Sometimes the unexpected can be great. Sometimes there is a reason for the beaten\
  \ path."
