Text: "Few Brazilians know about Ibitipoca, fewer foreigners know how to pronounce\
  \ it. From an indigenous origin, this tiny natural park is hidden in the state of\
  \ Minas Gerais, not close to the capital city and off route for most popular travel\
  \ destinations - the closest city is Juiz de Fora. Technology shows that the last\
  \ 30 kilometers take an hour to travel by car, but a skepticism made it seems impossible\
  \ after 450 kilometers from Sao Paulo. \nWe had plenty of time to research and call\
  \ the camping in the park which got me the information it was a first-come-first-served\
  \ basis. Four hours passed by and after a frustrated attempt to camp inside the\
  \ park when a small one-room house had a sign \u201CCamping available\u201D. No\
  \ cars or tents were in the eye-sight, but a \u201Cyes\u201D answer for a hot shower\
  \ question, made us decide to stay. \nOn the first day, the hike was to the park\
  \ main attraction \u2013 a small river runs into window\u2019s shape, called \u201C\
  The Sky\u2019s Window\u201D. No shades and no water stations were available, as\
  \ the paper guide had explained. Prepared as we were, basic needs were in our luggage.\
  \ On our way back, after 4 hours of hiking, a couple nearby was feeling the heat\
  \ so we shared our belongings and in exchange got their new stories on how to live\
  \ in the countryside of Brazil. By the end, our phone batteries ran out and we could\
  \ exchange contacts.  \nEven though the camping had everything we needed, technology\
  \ was not available in there. Not even a bar to make a call or check Netflix. For\
  \ the first time in years, technology was not an entertainment. \nNext day after\
  \ hiking, we got back to the camping and cooked a meal on the small balcony from\
  \ the one room house. As started to rain a group of friends arrived to share the\
  \ space, they were seven people and us two we became a crew. Later, two couples\
  \ arrived and started playing instruments: a guitar and a harmonica made the jams\
  \ while their voices started the songs. The three divided groups were singing together,\
  \ without even exchanging names. \nAfter a while, we presented ourselves and where\
  \ we came from. The night continued with more music and when saying good nights\
  \ someone thought of getting the Facebook accounts, but as the internet was not\
  \ working, we decided to live for later. But in the next day, each one woke up at\
  \ a different time leaving for sightseeing and in the afternoon, everybody went\
  \ home. We returned to technology with no contacts from people who had made our\
  \ April 19th, 2015 a remarkable day."
