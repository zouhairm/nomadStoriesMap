Text: "With sleep in our eyes and coffee on our breath, we drove westward with the\
  \ sun. Taking turns sleeping, waking in awe as landscapes alter, somehow becoming\
  \ more and less rocky; yellow Aspens our compass, guided us further west as miles\
  \ between us and home grew. Then the arrival of desert blinks into view, red rock\
  \ before us. We shed layers and chug water as we fastened laces and began walking\
  \ across desert slopes. Ideas of this place being overrated fade away as the heat\
  \ warms me from my inside out.\nBright sunshine dances along canyon walls after\
  \ being reflected off the Virgin River. People surround us, but as we continued\
  \ to walk numbers dwindled decidedly, their voices drowned by the sound of water\
  \ coursing around rocks and boulders\u200Ain symphony with our ooh\u2019s and ahh\u2019\
  s. \nClutching hiking sticks, thankful to have them, but only a fraction as thankful\
  \ to have neoprene boots to save our toes from frostbite and asses falling in the\
  \ river. As we hiked into solitude and magic, we sang songs, laughed, told stories\
  \ and jokes, cackled at mishaps that led to this surprisingly perfect place.\nThe\
  \ sky was black butcher paper pin pricked to expose light behind, the sound of coyotes\
  \ in the distance and fire crackling within earshot, smell of whiskey on my breath\
  \ combined with a hint of dust; proving the best of Utah and the desert.\nOur trip\
  \ began by leaving the cool Colorado temperatures behind for hot desert, camping\
  \ under stars, serenaded by our James Taylor singing camp neighbor. Ending after\
  \ a perfect hike IN a river THROUGH a canyon and sitting in red dirt by a fire drinking\
  \ whiskey wondering if life had ever been so wonderful. I could recommend a hundred\
  \ times (a day) a desert road trip of this magnitude and never fully convey my feelings.\
  \ It\u2019s the kind of trip where mishaps feel so serendipitous that nothing can\
  \ sour the taste of honey it leaves in your mouth. Because I had no idea, but you\
  \ see, Zion, Moab, the desert, feel like they\u2019ve known you all along, greeting\
  \ you as an old friend. I want to remember this friend: the sunshine creeping through\
  \ red rock, blisters from walking 30+ miles, sand in my toes. I want to remember\
  \ this friend who shockingly carved a chunk of heart from my chest holding onto\
  \ it, for safekeeping until I return, whence he will slyly take a larger chunk until\
  \ gradually, without realizing the desert captivates my entire heart\u200A \u2014\
  \u200A over campfires, sore feet and sun kissed cheeks, with a cheesy grin on my\
  \ face and a mug of whiskey in hand."
