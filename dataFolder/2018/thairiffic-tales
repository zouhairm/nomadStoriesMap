  \ What happened on my friend\u2019s first overseas getaway was the last thing I\
  \ expected. I thought Thailand. Not too far. Where you are in a different world\
  \ and yet have the comforts of home. We arrived in Bangkok Airport and her senses\
  \ immediately went into overload. Police looking serious in their uniforms and armed\
  \ weapons; the chaos of people whooshing past; smells that switch from being offensive\
  \ to delicious; and the humidity which stopped us in our tracks as the airport doors\
  \ opened, were overwhelming.\n\nWe made our way to a delightfully safe western hotel\
  \ for a first time traveller. We dropped off our bags, freshened up and were keen\
  \ to head out to celebrate a life milestone. I again did the safe thing and asked\
  \ the concierge where to go for drinks. Armed with this advice, we headed out into\
  \ Bangkok life. A few hours, and many drinks (including a fish bowl cocktail as\
  \ big as the size of my head) later, we were on the dance floor caught up in moves\
  \ and music nostalgic of the 90s when we were blinded by lights. The PA blasted\
  \ something in Thai in an aggressive voice; and the doors burst open to the charge\
  \ of the Drug Squad. \n\nThe men and women were segregated. Terrified (visualising\
  \ a scene from Bangkok Hilton), I hold my friend\u2019s hand and wandered around\
  \ asking if anyone spoke English. Nobody responded. It was then that we realised\
  \ we were the only western women in the room. We looked over to the men\u2019s side.\
  \ The majority were western men. We made our way to the front where we were told\
  \ to pee in a cup. I was now beside myself. We said that we would not do that. We\
  \ were shuffled to a separate room where we were questioned. Why are we here? How\
  \ long have we been in Thailand? Where are we staying? We answered all the questions\
  \ and to our relief the senior police officer believed us. He asked us what our\
  \ plans were next. We answered we were going to Koh Samui. His eyes widened, a huge\
  \ smile broke on his angry face and to our bewilderment, he responded with \u201C\
  I\u2019ve always dreamed of going to Koh Samui\u201D. Give me your hands\u201D.\
  \ He stamped us with the word \u2018clean\u2019 and told us to go. My friend and\
  \ I looked at each other with stunned looks. I grabbed her hand and off we ran.\
  \ \n\nThe chaos, energy and buzz of Bangkok carried across during our time there.\
  \ The small island of Koh Samui, idyllic, relaxed and surrounded by nature, did\
  \ the same. And with that, the magic of travelling entered her being!"
