Text: "Negombo, midnight after an 11 hour journey. I don't feel like taking a tuk\
  \ tuk so I decide to grumpily proceed with the 40 minute walk to my hostel. Shortly\
  \ after I've passed the busy streets and dodged a dozen tuk-tuks I start walking\
  \ along the deserted canal in the darkness. The voices of a group of men calling\
  \ me cut through the dark. I hastily go past them, but the sincerity of their calls\
  \ registers & throwing caution to the wind, I turn around. They're fishermen, celebrating\
  \ someone's birthday. They offer me arack & food, their kindness overwriting my\
  \ previous plans, I join them despite my immense exhaustion. We're friends now!\
  \ We arrange to meet tomorrow to go fishing. They make it their business to see\
  \ me home safe so Vivek, who isn't drunk to the point of oblivion, is given the\
  \ task to give me a ride to the hostel. The best poets could not describe how dear\
  \ this country & its people are to me. Letting fear dictate my decisions would result\
  \ in a far staler ending to the day. \nThe next morning I make my way to the canal\
  \ but nobody\u2019s there. After a few minutes I see Vivek waving from afar. He\
  \ explains that the rest of the fellowship got so wasted they're still sleeping,\
  \ but since I'm here he invites me to a soda. He shares a smoke with a couple of\
  \ fishermen casually preparing their hooks & stitching their nets by the canal.\
  \ He says it's safe to smoke here, unlike the beach, where police \u2018create trouble\u2019\
  . Two men carrying a basket with the contents concealed cross the towpath & enter\
  \ the perimeter of the cloud that engulfs us. They exchange a few words in \u200E\
  Sinhalese with our little squad. Vivek seems conflicted, he's not sure if I'm going\
  \ to like this but soon enough he urges me to follow. With a conspiratory look he\
  \ slowly reveals the insides of the basket. I stare at it aghast. It\u2019s filled\
  \ with organs and guts, but they're large, it couldn't be fish. Vivek explains it\u2019\
  s turtle remains. Apparently when turtles or dolphins get caught in the nets some\
  \ fishermen kill them to use as bait, which I\u2019m hearing works wonders in comparison\
  \ to what is normally available. It\u2019s illegal to do so and thus they cut through\
  \ the canal, were police don\u2019t \u2018create trouble\u2019! \nThis is their\
  \ livelihood, they don\u2019t know any better & passing judgement would be fruitless.\
  \ So I'm not really appalled and momentarily get amused with the idea of my fellow\
  \ mindfulness-filled, sanctimonious hostel-mates witnessing the intestines. Perhaps\
  \ they would've puked. I drink my soda."
