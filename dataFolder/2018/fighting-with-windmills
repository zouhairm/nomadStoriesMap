Text: "What makes people pursue their dreams? What, on the other side, makes them\
  \ sober down and forget those wild childish desires? In 2012 I started my own path\
  \ following my dream. Looking back now, it seems one of the most determined decisions\
  \ in the teenage age. \nAnd so six years of my student\u2019s life have passed:\
  \ stubbornly, directly, and fighting with windmills. That life included university,\
  \ falling in love, working as a teacher on language courses, and the dream of most\
  \ girls \u2013 romantic proposal\u2026 The perfect life for the onlooker. A lot\
  \ of hidden pitfalls for the insiders. That was until spring 2017 when I made the\
  \ decision that pushed me to the edge. Travelling. The one thing which always appealed\
  \ to me. The reason why I chose studying at the faculty of foreign languages.\n\
  Germany became the first point and it was worth suffering thirty \u2013 thirty!\
  \ \u2013 hours on the bus. My close acquaintance with the culture started as soon\
  \ as I arrived in Hanover and met my host family. Then we had to take a 2-hour trip\
  \ by car to the little communa near the Northern Sea. And here comes my first culture\
  \ shock \u2013 no speed limits on the highway. On the next day I had to try to push\
  \ my inner borders and despite all of the anxiety use my bad German instead of English.\
  \ Until the third day I was already introduced to the Lower Saxony dialect, and\
  \ now I could proudly walk into the supermarket and greet the shop assistant with\
  \ traditional \u201CMoin!\u201D\nGermany is a country of difference, you may spot\
  \ it everywhere in both always polite and cheerful people who are not against a\
  \ small talk with a stranger and people who are never afraid to tell what they think\
  \ and carry their point. It can be as diverse as one can imagine. Germany was romantic\
  \ when I enjoyed velvet sunset on the seashore in Bremerhaven. It was adventurous\
  \ to go to Essen on a basketball match with a full bus of basketball fans, and eventually\
  \ become a fan myself. And it was spiritual to visit K\xF6lner Dom \u2013 the highest\
  \ cathedral in Europe.  Standing underneath it, one cannot but think that here they\
  \ are, the pillars of Earth propping the clouds. Finally, it is in a lot of details,\
  \ such as trash recycling, big meal portions in restaurants, or eating raclette\
  \ on Christmas Eve. \nGermany is the country which may definitely change a person.\
  \ Some say to me that I have seen only good neglecting the dark side of the moon.\
  \ However, everyone is finding what he is looking for, right? So am I, looking forward\
  \ to the next destination."
