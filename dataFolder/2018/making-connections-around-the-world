Text: "Two stories from this past summer, both around making connections: \nAug 23:\
  \ A couple of days ago, I set out my home with the intention to go spend the day\
  \ in Nice; I had some errands to run there. I know my way to the train station,\
  \ it's a 10-15 minutes walk max, and I've taken the train many times. It was hot,\
  \ and I was starting to feel shaky for some reason, maybe because I hadn't eaten\
  \ and my blood pressure was dropping. So, I was going around in circles and, couldn't\
  \ get to the train station. Dazed and confused, I gave up, I decided to go have\
  \ a plateau fruits de mer at the really nice restaurant I've been meaning to try.\
  \ Once seated, ordered, food came, I noticed a couple tables over a handsome 'Hugh\
  \ Grant' lookalike, but much much better in-person, and he had ordered the platter\
  \ like me. And, like me, he had his book with him. So, I started talking to him\
  \ across the two tables between us. Slowly at first, but by the end of lunch, dessert\
  \ (delicious pear and ice cream) and coffee, I had told him about my travels, being\
  \ on the road the past ten years, my professional background, and my interests in\
  \ travel, culture, and world affairs only to find out that this gorgeous man, who\
  \ was listening so attentively to my stories, is a well-known Film and Documentary\
  \ producer on travel, culture, politics, and woman's empowerment. What a surreal\
  \ experience; we kissed and hugged twice we were both so excited how life brought\
  \ us together in this moment. Moral of the story: be yourself, be open, do good,\
  \ connect with people, and allow life to unfold for you. \nAug 29: I made a new\
  \ friend on the bus yesterday. Joz\xE9 Jo\xE3o Lourenc\xF3 started talking to me\
  \ at the bus station. Later on in the bus he called me to sit next to him at the\
  \ front seat. During a short bus stop in one of the towns, he invited me to coffee\
  \ and Portuguese sweets. When we returned to the bus, our conversation took-off,\
  \ non-stop until I arrived my destination. Joz\xE9 Jo\xE3o, 70+ years with Parkinson's\
  \ disease, and a past car accident that left his neck area dislocated, is a well-established\
  \ self-taught artist, working at his studio Atelier San Antonio das Areias. He is\
  \ also the Founder of several charity organizations, one of which is a rescue mission\
  \ for the forest fires, and another offers medical services (cleft mouth) to those\
  \ in need. Jos\xE9 Jean will be showing 40 paintings at an inaugural exhibition\
  \ on September 8 in Marv\xE3o, to which I have been invited. He's also visiting\
  \ me today where I'm staying."
