Text: "Cold morning breeze hit my face as I would take the first sip of our 72% liquor,\
  \ it felt like a burning knife went down my throat. It was early morning and our\
  \ journey to survive the coldest winter night, somewhere in the middle of nowhere\
  \ began.\nWe slowly but safely walked through the winter forest, carrying our lives\
  \ on our backs.And the devil\xB4s liquor in my backpack, patiently waited on us\
  \ to fall into his hands. The scenario was stunning, no one else would dare to hike\
  \ this hill in this time of year. All of the winter beauty was left just just for\
  \ us. Sometimes it felt like we are in a completly different world, everything was\
  \ covered in white powder. \nIt was all fun and games until the sun slowly started\
  \ to set down, and in matter of minutes the temperature felt down rapidly. We slowly\
  \ started realizing that we have no chance of survivng outside, with temperatures\
  \ reaching down to -30 \xB0C at night, after all it was supposed to be the coldest\
  \ night in this winter. At this point we hiked for about 8 hours, through a very\
  \ difficult terrain. The lodge where we would spend the night was supposed to be\
  \ close by. After a while of desperate search we finally found it. It was hidden\
  \ in a small forest next to the road. The lodge was made of really thin wooden walls,\
  \ which had many gaps in between them. Quickly,we madly started choping near by\
  \ trees, like our lives would depend on it. We had only about half an hour before\
  \ the sun set, and already it was about -8 \xB0C. I could barely feel my fingers.\n\
  Somehow, with all the stress to squeze every second for maximum productivty, I managed\
  \ to break the saw. Adam looked, and stared quietly for about a minute at me,and\
  \ then at the broken saw, so on and so forth. There we were, lost in the no man\xB4\
  s land, with a full bottle of devil\xB4s own booze, trying to save our buttocks\
  \ from freezing. But at least before the incident with my skilled hands, we managed\
  \ to produce a decent amount of wood supplies.\nWe managed to get throught the night.\
  \ It was the most uncomfortable night I ever experienced, I saw myself in a different\
  \ light. I will never forget how glad I was I could enjoy the sunrise the next morning\
  \ .This whole experienced made me appreciate life even more, but looking back I\
  \ would do it again. It was one of those experiences that you just have go through.\
  \ But surely, it made me respect power of the nature more, it could all end up really\
  \ badly. But I believe that these kind of experiences help me define myself."
