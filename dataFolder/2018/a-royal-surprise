Text: "A Royal Surprise\n\n I squinted over broad shoulders and floppy toque pom-poms,\
  \ straining to hear the policewoman from the restless crowd's heart. It was like\
  \ trying to hear a whisper over an orchestra's thundering crescendo, for crisp English,\
  \ silken French, and staccato Mandarin echoed off the lemon yellow storefronts,\
  \ laced with question marks as palpable as the cobbles under my boots. I shivered,\
  \ my breaths like silver ghosts in the honeyed spring morning, and I was about to\
  \ follow a tantalizing waft of roasting coffee and sugary hot waffles when the policewoman\
  \ addressed us in her curt Swedish accent: \n \"There will be a parade and royal\
  \ appearance in honour of the King's birthday!\"\n Excitement rustled among the\
  \ crowd, our voices giddy as wind-blown autumn leaves. A glance to my right confirmed\
  \ her words, for the street bristled on both sides with cherry cheeked tourists,\
  \ the parade's path clearly paved between them. \n Music boomed, the notes brassy\
  \ and bright as the morning itself, and a white and navy marching band paraded down\
  \ the street, instruments shimmering, blue eyes pinned on the yawning palace gates.\
  \ Grinning, I took dozens of pictures with my dented purple camera, keeping an eye\
  \ out for the King only for the parade to abruptly come to an end. As it did, the\
  \ crowd's excitement wavered, all of Stockholm buzzing with questions until the\
  \ policewoman spoke again: \n \"They will appear on the balcony in less than an\
  \ hour!\"\n Determined not to miss it, my family and I passed the time inside the\
  \ palace, clattering up coiled marble stairs and into the cream coloured throne\
  \ room. While my dad and brother admired the pale ornate throne, my mom and I bent\
  \ over a guest book, giggling like little girls as we signed our names in looping\
  \ navy script. After, we meandered the vast room, faces upturned, lapping up the\
  \ frescoed ceilings until it was time to head back into the frigid golden morning.\
  \ \n We threaded through the courtyard, rubbing shoulders with the press, their\
  \ cameras' lightning flashes erupting around us. Sure enough, the royal family stood\
  \ on the balcony, their shoulders cresting the top of a dark blue banner, eyes flickering\
  \ over the crowd as they murmured amongst themselves. \n I hardly blinked before\
  \ the King and Queen appeared, rousing cheers from the crowd. Beaming, they waved\
  \ with gloved hands, smiles glowing as we peasants waved back, and I felt my own\
  \ smile spread as I snapped a final flurry of photos. \n Now this, I thought, is\
  \ a birthday celebration!"
