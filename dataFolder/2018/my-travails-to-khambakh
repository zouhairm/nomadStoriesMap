Text: "For my friends and I last August, the dread of wasting our holidays prompted\
  \ a plan to visit Karomber Lake, which we would access by crossing Darkot, a mountain\
  \ pass 4703 meters above sea level. Sixteen of us, rucksacks on our backs, started\
  \ the walk to the pass in high spirits, little suspecting the events that awaited\
  \ us. With a break for the essential Pakistani need \u2013 tea, we trekked 15 km\
  \ to the campsite, and arrived exhausted and thirsty at a desolate gorge between\
  \ two peaks, which the locals referred to as Khambakh - Eagle\u2019s Nest.\nFour\
  \ of us were tasked with fetching water for the rest of our companions as they set\
  \ up the tents. In the pitch dark, we were reduced to solely relying on our head\
  \ lights, and filled our water tanks from the stream we came upon. Luck deserted\
  \ us however, on our way back. Suddenly, the night erupted in a shriek as one of\
  \ my friends lost his balance and fell into the ravine below. Immediately, one of\
  \ us rushed off to the campsite for help as the remaining two of us started in the\
  \ direction of the scream. We struggled with our own balance, buffeted by the harsh,\
  \ cold winds, and minutes later my remaining companion, failing to anticipate a\
  \ sharp turn in the stream we were descending beside, fell into it. Cold, terrified\
  \ and alone, like someone out of a childhood parable, I was left to make the decision\
  \ of which friend to help first. \nDeciding that the friend who had landed up in\
  \ the water was more vulnerable to harm from the jagged rocks that populated the\
  \ mountainous stream, I jumped into the stream, placing my muffler on the ground\
  \ so the rest could find us. It was the worst decision of my life. The stream was\
  \ freezing, numbing my limbs as the water pounded into me, pushing me along until\
  \ I saw my friend\u2019s headlight up ahead. He was trapped between two rocks, barely\
  \ conscious; I pulled myself towards him with herculean effort, untangling him with\
  \ one last impossible push. Dragging him along to the edge, I came out of the water,\
  \ and fell down with him beside me, losing consciousness.  \nWhen I eventually woke\
  \ up in camp, I was told that lady luck was very kind on us and we had all managed\
  \ to come out of our ill-fated adventure alive with minor injuries. A small price\
  \ to pay for the wonders we would experience in the coming few days. The lake we\
  \ set out to see made it all worth it."
