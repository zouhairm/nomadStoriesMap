Text: "Sleeping bag, cozy jumper and trekking shoes. I load my 30-pound beloved backpack\
  \ on my shoulders, leave the bus and off I go along the dusty red road leading inside\
  \ the Monument Valley Navajo Reserve. After an hour of hiking, a human figure emerges\
  \ from one of the bigger sand dunes. As he gets closer, shapes become more defined:\
  \ long black hair, small, dark eyes and a large curved nose. He greets me in a language\
  \ I don\u2019t understand, but I smile back. He asks: \u201CYou, happy?\u201D. There\
  \ is something reassuring in the features of his face, maybe the tiny angle of his\
  \ lips when he smiles or the intense colour of his eyes. I reply: \u201CExplore!\
  \ You, guide me?\u201D. His eyebrows shrink together, as if puzzled by my request,\
  \ then he nods and offers his hand.\n\nHe walks away from the main road, unravelling\
  \ paths partially hidden by the sand. We reach a desolate spot: huge, majestic red\
  \ rocks stand tall around us. My guide climbs one of the highest rocks and I follow\
  \ him, stumbling on my unexperienced feet. When I clumsily arrive at the top, he\
  \ points at my heart and asks: \u201CYou, full?\u201D, then opens his arms, as if\
  \ to embrace all the natural beauty around us. I breathe in and the smell of pure\
  \ nature fills my lungs. When we climb down, we find ourselves surrounded by a herd\
  \ of free wild horses. A small, bright, white one makes its way towards me. I stand\
  \ still. The horse comes closer and softly leans against me. This simple physical\
  \ contact is so powerful that I can\u2019t reject the impulse of jumping on its\
  \ back, an act of full, inebriating madness.\n\nThe horse starts running. I hold\
  \ myself as tight as I can to its mane, my legs wrapped around its body. I can feel\
  \ my heart pumping through my chest, pure excitement running in my veins and chunks\
  \ of red sand rising up from the ground at every step. In this wild run, red, orange\
  \ and blue merge into a unique indistinct nuance, the colour of wilderness. I fall\
  \ down. My body sinks into the warm hug of the sand and my lungs gasp searching\
  \ for fresh air. I start laughing so intensely that tears run down my cheeks. I\
  \ am a horrendous mixture of dirty tears and sticky dust, yet my heart is full of\
  \ clean emotions. I am happy, I am full, I am free.\n\nA tense guide approaches\
  \ me and after checking that I am still alive, from his visible distress emerges\
  \ a sound laugh. He points at me shouting: \u201CYou, w-i-l-d!\u201D and collapses\
  \ on the ground laughing uncontrollably. \u201CYes\u201D, I reply: \u201CWild is\
  \ my colour\u201D."
