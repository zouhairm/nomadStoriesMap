Text: "I had never expected to live in Asia, I was aiming for Europe when the thought\
  \ of living abroad came up. But there I was, being picked up at Saigon airport by\
  \ a stranger called Minh who tried to explain everything there was to know about\
  \ living in Vietnam. It wasn\u2019t long until I found myself in a small hotel room\
  \ right in the heart of district 1, a block away from Ph\u1EA1m Ng\u0169 L\xE3o\
  \ street. \nI had recently got a certificate to teach adults from Cambridge University\
  \ in Denver at The Bridge International School, where a somewhat quiet guy behind\
  \ his desk at the teacher\u2019s office suggested me two places where I could go:\
  \ either Prague in the Czech Republic or Ho Chi Minh City in Vietnam.\n- Wait, Vietnam?\
  \ \u2013 I said.\n- It truly is a wonderful place \u2013 he rehearsed a timid smile,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t tell whether he was helping me or being condescending.\n- Have\
  \ you been there? \u2013 I asked. Looking down at pile of papers he said - Nope.\n\
  I spoke with a couple of friends who had been to Vietnam and all they said was \u201C\
  the place is beautiful, people are sweet, you\u2019re going to love it, don\u2019\
  t think twice, pack your bags and go\u201D. Next thing I knew I was buying tickets\
  \ to travel to Asia for the first time. \nAll the preparation for my travel was\
  \ summed up in a visit to the \u201CPho house\u201D, a Vietnamese restaurant in\
  \ Denver, and a conversation over the phone with the head of the teachers of the\
  \ school where I was now going to.\nVietnam is intense, the streets smell like Pho,\
  \ there are as many tourists on the crowded sidewalks as there are locals on motorbikes,\
  \ the noise is everywhere from loud TVs showing soap operas to radio speakers blasting\
  \ music as if everyone had hearing problems. Sure, it\u2019s become a common tourist\
  \ destination, but I was not a visitor, rather I was an English teacher who would\
  \ eat, drink and commute in the midst of that chaos everyday. \nAnd I loved it.\n\
  Locals recognized me as one of theirs and more often than not they would tell me\
  \ where to go and what to do. Do you know you\u2019re not supposed to touch a child\u2019\
  s head in Vietnam? Or that if a fight breaks out you\u2019d better get out of the\
  \ way? It\u2019s not a good idea trying to be the hero when you\u2019re Saigon.\
  \ \nMr. Nguy\u1EC5n, the manager of the hotel where I stayed, along with the good\
  \ local people at the ILA Vietnam (where I taught) made sure I was always on the\
  \ right track whenever there was any culture shock. In less than a month, I made\
  \ Vietnam my home and the connections I made there seem to be on their way to last\
  \ a lifetime."
