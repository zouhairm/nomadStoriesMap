Text: "As the car bumped along the cobblestone roads leading from the airport,  I\
  \ looked out of the passenger side window at what would be my home for the next\
  \ three months. Seeing as it was 9:30 at night, all I saw were long, dark stretches\
  \ of highway. \n\nAll of a sudden, it hit me what I was actually doing. I was 19\
  \ years old and had graduated high school less than a year prior. Instead of going\
  \ to college right away, I wanted to learn while not in a classroom, and maybe accomplish\
  \ something other than just homework. After lots of research, I decided the best\
  \ way to do this was to volunteer at a nonprofit for children in Antigua, Guatemala,\
  \ take Spanish classes at a language school, and stay with a host family (arranged\
  \ by the school). \n\nSo, here I was, leaving the U.S. for the first time without\
  \ my family, to move a country I\u2019d never been to. And I was currently on my\
  \ way to meet the random family I\u2019d be staying with for the next 90 days.\n\
  \nWhen we pulled up to the address, I got out of the car, thanked the driver, collected\
  \ my suitcase from the trunk, and tentatively knocked on the door.\n\nThe door swung\
  \ open, and I found myself in the midst of a family dinner - with someone else\u2019\
  s family. After stumbling through a Spanglish conversation about where I was from\
  \ and why I was there, I went to bed.\n\nWhen I woke up the next day, I had a moment\
  \ of panic - I was alone, didn't know my way around, and barely knew the language.\
  \ After a brief crying spell, I gave myself a pep talk, and made myself leave.\n\
  \nI got lost on the way home from my volunteer job, and left my mom in the US a\
  \ stressed-out voicemail. She called the school, who called my host mom, who greeted\
  \ me at home with a hug. She told me that for the next three months, she was my\
  \ mom, and that if I ever needed anything, she wanted me to call her instead.\n\n\
  Over the next few days, this family that had once been perfect strangers quickly\
  \ started to really feel like family. Some of my happiest memories of my three months\
  \ in Antigua are Sunday mornings after breakfast, when my host dad would put on\
  \ salsa music and we would all salsa dance in the living room in our pajamas.\n\n\
  I also quickly gained a confidence I had never had in my previous 19 years of life,\
  \ a confidence that has stuck with me 7 years and 17 countries later. I look back\
  \ on those first hours in Guatemala with a smile - my first adventure after high\
  \ school, my first solo trip, my first time staying with complete strangers who\
  \ would soon become family."
