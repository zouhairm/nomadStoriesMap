Text: "On the penultimate day of Rio2016, I went to see the Pentathlon at Deodoro,\
  \ which despite being a military area, it\u2019s surrounded by populated slums with\
  \ serious social problems: even the police do not want to go there, as fatally had\
  \ happened days before. Simultaneously at Maracan\xE3, Brazil was playing the Olympic\
  \ Soccer finals against Germany, trying to overcome the recent 7-1 defeat.\n\nLate\
  \ afternoon was coming, under a hellish heat. From the bus windows, the view was\
  \ bleak: there were vast valleys of silver color wavy plates, orange bricks and\
  \ blue water-reservoirs. No one in the streets, no dogs or cats. Just empty white\
  \ plastic bags, rolling with the wind.\n\nWould I be the same, if I had been born\
  \ there?\n\nDespite my fears, the outward journey was peaceful: just a baby\u2019\
  s sob interrupted the lull.\nBrazil scored a goal.\n\nAlready at Deodoro, I went\
  \ through three security control points full of soldiers, and entered the pentathlon\
  \ stadium with a noisy crowd. The sky was covered by ominous clouds. After seeing\
  \ three monkeys making fun on a small tree, it began to rain heavily.\nGermany tied\
  \ the game.\n\nOn the benches, there were hundreds of colorful umbrellas and unusual\
  \ \"Wet T-Shirt\" competitions\u2026 in the field, there were horses jumping, people\
  \ running and firing lasers: a real Carnival.\nAt Maracan\xE3, the extension began.\n\
  \nWhen the night came, it was time to return: the bus was escorted by army vehicles.\
  \ Everything dark outsides, no one in the slums, no other cars on the highway: just\
  \ us and the military as bodyguards. When they approached, we could see how old\
  \ they were: no more than 20 years. Our safety was being done by kids!\n\nHow would\
  \ they be, if they had been born on my street?\n\nSuddenly, I saw the military kids\
  \ smiling and laughing: their target was LUCY, a blonde girl sitting three windows\
  \ ahead of me. Not intimidated, she returned the flirt. They fired back: not bazookas\
  \ for the \u201Cbrazuca\u201D, but rather \u201Cselfies\u201D and laughs. The military\
  \ cars scratched the road, trying to hit the rhythm of our bus. The windows almost\
  \ kissed.\n\nAt that moment, I realized the origin of samba\u2019s steps: help us\
  \ not burn in the coals of LUCIFER.\nI also realized that a kid, in spite of being\
  \ armed, will always be a kid.\n\nLater in Copacabana, while eating a Portuguese\
  \ cabbage soup with a couple of German friends in a crowded outdoor bar, Neymar\
  \ scored the penalty shootout of victory."
