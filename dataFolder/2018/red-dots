Text: "I stepped out of the The Beauty World Station and started dragging my bags\
  \ on the sidewalk. A girl with many inhibitions, gaze set to the ground, hoping\
  \ to avoid any eye-contact. I noticed the grass was wet from a shower the night\
  \ before.\nIt was a long walk to the TohTuck Street. Travelling in heels wasn't\
  \ such a great idea after all. \nAs I unpacked, I read the last entry in my journal\
  \ for the 50th time: First Solo Trip, 19 years old. It had still not sunk in. The\
  \ country i come from sees women as liabilities, we hardly get sent anywhere unescorted.\
  \ Yet here I was, in Singapore, all alone.\nDay One. I was the perfect tourist,\
  \ visiting the mandirs of Little India, dinner at Chinatown and back at 10:30 sharp.\
  \ It rained again that night. Making an entry for the day in my diary (careful to\
  \ include all compliments), I went to bed. Repeated the process for the second day,\
  \ however the angle of depression for my gaze certainly reduced.\nI reached Gardens\
  \ by the Bay at 4:00 pm, unaware that it would soon be my favourite place on Earth.\
  \ Third day, my walk was confident, gaze set straight, observing the tourists, the\
  \ backpackers and smiling at whoever looked my way. I was craving for an adventure.\n\
  And then I witnessed what I like to describe as the most spectacular view man ever\
  \ created. Giant sci-fi trees, changing colours to the 70\u2019s tunes, sounds like\
  \ quite a sight,doesn\u2019t it? Vertical gardens, mighty as they stood, covered\
  \ in blinking lights, every stargazer\u2019s paradise, including my own!\nI didn\u2019\
  t want to leave. Not after the first show, nor after the last one. I just wanted\
  \ to lie in the starry shade, as awestruck as a little girl watching magic show\
  \ for the first time. In what happens to be my brightest thought ever, I asked myself,\
  \ What really was stopping me from staying?\nAnd lo! It was post midnight. An eerie\
  \ sense of magic gluing my sight and of few others to the trees and our bums to\
  \ the ground.\nSuddenly I heard somebody call to me, two Latin American backpackers\
  \ and a Google translator, doing the job for us. What followed was a four 4-hour\
  \ long conversation. Their reaction to how young I was to be travelling alone elated\
  \ me. Adrian showed me a map marked with red flags, depicting the places he had\
  \ been to. Hundreds of red dots yet nowhere close to covering the globe. We\u2019\
  re nothing but tiny specks of dust indeed i remember thinking.\nThe last thing I\
  \ expected was to find my purpose in a tourist park in Singapore at 2:00am: Touch\
  \ the red dots and create my own."
