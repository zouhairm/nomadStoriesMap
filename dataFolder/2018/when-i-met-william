Text: "When I was in high school, William and I took a surf trip to Costa Rica.  In\
  \ the early nineties, the small country with no military was rugged, both in its\
  \ terrain and lifestyle, where a washed out section of the road was marked with\
  \ a yellow- painted stick and fence posts were just trees planted in a straight\
  \ row with a couple of strands of thin wire connecting them.   Back before there\
  \ were any fast food chains or Remax signs, the sight of Costa Rica was arresting,\
  \ the verdant mountainous rainforest cascading into the azure sea like Mother Nature\
  \ herself was dipping her toes in the water to test the temperature.  \n\nWe drove\
  \ a sun-faded 4-Runner to our hotel near Jaco Beach, a bustling town of tourists\
  \ and expats that was essentially one swath of a haphazardly paved road lined with\
  \ local merchants transforming their hardware and electronic stores into souvenir\
  \ shops overnight.  Costa Rica was undergoing a sort of renaissance that was marked\
  \ by the arrival of a Burger King and Best Western.  \n\nJust past the town of Jaco\
  \ was our hotel, the Terrazo del Pacifico, a moderate two-story complex chosen solely\
  \ for its proximity to a known surf break.  The grounds were well-kept, with thick,\
  \ spongy grass, trimmed hedges and colorful bougainvillea and Hibiscus plants. \
  \ There was a donut-shaped pool where the \u201Chole\u201D of the donut housed a\
  \ small swim-up bar that was never stocked or tended and seemed to be more a gathering\
  \ place for the hotel\u2019s leftover lamps and other misfit fixtures.  The hotel\
  \ was utilitarian in that it served its purpose, which was a place to sleep and\
  \ eat for those charging the nearby swells.\n\nWilliam and I spent ten days together,\
  \ surfing and eating rice and beans and getting to know each other.  Truth be told,\
  \ I didn\u2019t really like surfing , but I loved William and I cherished every\
  \ second that we spent together.  As a child, I don\u2019t think you can truly appreciate\
  \ your parents.  You don\u2019t see them as individuals with dreams and desires\
  \ and a full life already lived.  William had been my dad for 17 years, we shared\
  \ the same house and had countless conversations\u2026 but I didn\u2019t know him,\
  \ not really, until that trip. He had been a roadie for a rock band, was in bad\
  \ motorcycle accident in his twenties and knew instantly that he loved my mom when\
  \ he met her. \n \nI am older now, and I have two boys of my own.  And I am already\
  \ planning our first trip together."
