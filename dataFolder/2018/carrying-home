Text: "An Ethiopian Airlines flight, Nairobi to Addis Ababa. I recognise many of the\
  \ words crackling over the intercom. It is like listening to the words of a once-loved\
  \ but half-forgotten song. This was a regular run once, three years ago. The  excitement\
  \ of my two young neighbours is infectious. It is their first flight. They ask me\
  \ to take a picture of them. I oblige. They make various poses, and I take several\
  \ pictures. The brother Abdi, younger by a few years, takes out his certificate\
  \ and proudly shows me the excellent marks that have won him a scholarship to a\
  \ university in Sudan. He reads the rapturous remarks of his teacher out loud. At\
  \ the top of the document is emblazoned the logo of a madrassa in Mandera. \u201C\
  Do you know where Mandera is?\u201D he asks. \u201COf course,\u201D I reply. \u201C\
  There is nothing to indicate that there is a border with Somalia,\u201D says the\
  \ sister, Saida. \u201CUnatembea tu.\u201D You just walk. \u201CWhat is it like\
  \ now?\u201D I ask. \u201CSasa hakuna shida.\u201D I am relieved to hear that the\
  \ troubles have abated. \u201CWhat are you going to study?\u201D I ask. \u201CI\u2019\
  m going to study Islamic Studies. She\u2019s going to study Sharia Law. She also\
  \ won a scholarship. But she studied in Garissa not Mandera,\u201D says Abdi. \u201C\
  What will you do afterwards?\u201D I ask. \u201CAfterwards I might do my Masters\
  \ in Saudi Arabia or Malaysia,\u201D he replies. \u201CWhen I finish my studies\
  \ I\u2019ll come back to teach. \u201CFour years is a long time,\u201D sighs Saida.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019ll miss home. Our little brothers were crying when we left.\u201D\
  \ \u201CThere\u2019s a Kenyan community in Khartoum so we\u2019ll have some friends\
  \ from home,\u201D says Abdi. \u201CI have to work on my English and Swahili. My\
  \ Arabic is very good but I have to work on my other languages.\u201D I marvel at\
  \ their unsullied youth and earnest ambition. \u201CYou know,\u201D says Saida,\
  \ \u201Can aeroplane is just like a bus.\u201D  \u201CHow long did it take you to\
  \ get to Nairobi from Mandera?\u201D I ask. \u201CAbout two days,\u201D says Saida.\
  \ We part ways in the Bole airport, saying kwaheri. Goodbye and good luck. Bole\
  \ is bigger and shinier than I remembered. Takeoff from Nairobi had delayed: my\
  \ 30-minute transit time has been reduced to 15. A uniformed lady with a walkie-talkie\
  \ asks me, \u201CYet?\u201D Where to? I marvel at how instantaneously my mind deciphers\
  \ this. I had thought all my Amharic gone. She commandeers me through a security\
  \ check and down a flight of stairs into the waiting bus that will take us to the\
  \ waiting plane. I remember my two young compatriots and smile. They remind me of\
  \ myself many years ago. The thrill of new beginnings."
