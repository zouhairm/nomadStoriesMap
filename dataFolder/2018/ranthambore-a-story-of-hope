Text: "December of 2017 had just started and I decided to have a solo trip to Ranthambore\
  \ Tiger Reserve situated in the heart of Rajsthan. Reason of the solo trip was that\
  \ no close friend of mine was in India and I haven't been on any long outing since\
  \ almost a year. Ashish my high school friend had came up with the start up in the\
  \ traveling sector and he adjusted me in the group of total strangers. But the moment\
  \ I embarked on the train and got acquainted with the strangers they were strangers\
  \ no more. They became part of me as they accepted me and I did the same. A group\
  \ of 6 cousin sisters and their respective mothers. \nBefore actual jungle safari\
  \ I'd like to mention and anecdote. In the summer of '15 my twin nephews had came\
  \ to my place on their vacation which was on the verge of it's end because summer\
  \ was almost over and the pre-monsoon rains were knocking doors and roofs almost\
  \ every day. One evening I disgusted because of the play of mine got cancelled was\
  \ in my room and my nephews were in the hall. And rains started. And with that my\
  \ nephews, sitting on the grills of the window started screaming giggling and cheering.\
  \ I out of rage walked to the hall to close the window, but I couldn't. Their smiled\
  \ and newly arriving teeth peeping through that smile stopped me from wiping that\
  \ smile. I stood there for a moment and by now City lights were gone as it happens\
  \ all the time in India in the rains, the whole city was covered in the dark. And\
  \ suddenly a lightning flashed followed by the roar of the clouds and my nephews\
  \ screamed. I couldn't understand why. And that curiosity followed for 3 long years\
  \ until Jungle of ranthambore answered it.  \nAs the safaris started we all were\
  \ eager to the see the stars of the Ranthambore. The tigers but we didn't get to\
  \ see one. My friends told me that I had chosen a wrong season perhaps. So my heart\
  \ along with the others sank more. We had 5 safaris planned and so we had those\
  \ and as we couldn't sight Tiger we shifted our focus from tigers to other animals\
  \ and the ecosystem. But deep down the urge was there to see the tiger. We started\
  \ our journey back to resort from jungle after last safari and hearts in the abyss\
  \ and cameras in the bags. And eyes staring into nothing. \nBut as we exited from\
  \ the main gate of the jungle we got to see the Lightning. T-83. And my heart jumped\
  \ and jounced in the wilderness and my curiosity of the lightning from the past\
  \ was answered. What both lightnings taught was that to never give up on hope."
