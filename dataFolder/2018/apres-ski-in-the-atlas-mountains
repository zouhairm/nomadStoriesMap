Text: "As our plane approaches the gate at Menara airport in Marrakech, Matt and I\
  \ glance at each other with a \"what the hell are we doing here?\" kind of look.\
  \ For most Canadians traveling to Morocco in February, the sight of heat radiating\
  \ off the tarmac, palm trees, and sunny skies would be a welcome one. But Matt (my\
  \ younger brother) and I aren't here for the comparatively-tropical weather: we're\
  \ here as part of a life-long quest to ski on all seven continents in the world.\
  \ With multiple snow-capped peaks sitting at over 4,000 m in elevation, there is\
  \ no better place than the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco to achieve the outlandish\
  \ feat of \"skiing in Africa\".\n\nAfter a couple days exploring the dizzying scenes\
  \ of Marrakech, we escape to the tranquility of the mountains. \n\nWe're heading\
  \ for the Refuge de L\xE9piney, a small stone hut, which sits on a rock bluff near\
  \ the head of the Azzaden Valley. Our muleteer signals the end of his journey when\
  \ we reach snowline, and Matt and I shoulder the full weight of our gear. With skis,\
  \ boots, safety and climbing equipment now resting fully on my back, I can't help\
  \ but feel sorry for the mule. Soon after, we bump into a Berber man smoking a cigarette,\
  \ while sitting on some rocks next to the trail. He is Brahim, the hut caretaker\
  \ who will stay with us for the duration of our trip.  \n\nFor several days Matt\
  \ and I ski some of the most exotic lines that either of us could ever imagine:\
  \ long, narrow couloirs that look out onto the desert and go on for longer than\
  \ our legs can handle. At the hut, we enjoy Brahim's traditional Moroccan dishes:\
  \  steaming tagines, hearty couscous, and endless pots of mint tea. Brahim tells\
  \ us of his family, his children, and his life in the village of Tizi Oussem, just\
  \ down the valley, while we explain the concept of high speed chairlifts and ice\
  \ hockey. Despite living in seemingly different worlds, we tell jokes and laugh,\
  \ learn Berber and English words, and take turns winning hands of Uno.\n\nBefore\
  \ we leave, Brahim gives us advice on our next passage through the mountains and\
  \ we exchange addresses and hugs. Although we came for the skiing, which did not\
  \ disappoint, we leave having made a new friend. \n\nDays later, back in Marrakech,\
  \ we revel in the success of our adventure and newfound friendship. While carrying\
  \ our same ski gear through the narrow streets of the medina, we seem to attract\
  \ as many looks as the snake charmers, monkeys, and circus performers. What a wonderful\
  \ land of contrasts."
