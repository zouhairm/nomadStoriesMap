Text: "'What's your name?' I asked the little boy. 'Askari,' meekly he replied, that\
  \ too after much deliberation. His stark pink cheeks had a flush of blush. 'Where\
  \ do you live?' was the first question that elicited an enthusiastic response as\
  \ the 6-year-old timidly pointed out towards a house, standing discreet within a\
  \ cluster of many. \n\nYes, the entire Trespone village is visible when you are\
  \ standing atop this majestic 18th century Imambara 'A shrine for Shia Muslims',\
  \ which is not only the centre-point of the village, but also a sight impossible\
  \ to miss for people cruising towards the more popular Zanskar valley on this newest\
  \ addition to the list of Indian highways; National Highway 301, running between\
  \ Kargil and Zanskar.\n\nThe foundation stone of the Imambara was laid in 1715,\
  \ when the king of Suru Valley, 'Thi Mohammad Sultan' invited scholar Syed Meer\
  \ Ali from Baltistan (now in Pakistan) for preaching. A legend states how Syed Meer\
  \ Ali chose a Bluish stone as the foundation, and when the villagers reached the\
  \ spot the next day to begin construction, the walls of the Imambara were already\
  \ up by 3 feet. \n\nAfter three centuries, the Imambara stands tall as the village's\
  \ sole iconic site; having witnessed generations after generations, while being\
  \ the only constant in their lives. It's so dear to Trespone that every time an\
  \ important visitor or government official comes along, Imambara is where they are\
  \ served tea and food. \n\nBut, Imambara is not just the common drawing and dining\
  \ room to the village, or just a place for delivery of a preaching ,or the gathering\
  \ on Muharram, it also served as the shelter to many during the Kargil armed conflict\
  \ of 1999. While India and Pak battled for the capture of Tiger Hill - a strategically\
  \ crucial vantage point for their armies, Imambara was where many affected families\
  \ from the nearby regions found a safe shelter, and their children, education.\n\
  \nThe Imambara could soon be a heritage site under the protection of the Archaeological\
  \ Survey of India. However, it is not something the villagers are looking forward\
  \ to, for the regulated area laws will mean many of them losing their houses, and\
  \ above that, the intimacy that exists when everything about the monument is totally\
  \ their own. \n\n'Can I have a look inside?' I asked. A coy smile on Askari's face.\
  \ I repeated my question; soon I found him running towards his home he had pointed\
  \ to, calling out for someone. In his enthusiastic sprint, a vivid memory of mine\
  \ was drawn."
