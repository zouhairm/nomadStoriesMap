Text: "\u201CIt might let up,\u201D Our optimist lead speculated after lunch.  \u201C\
  Let\u2019s move! We\u2019re not even halfway to the campsite.\u201D\nSeems forever.\
  \ It\u2019s been like five hours of hiking on a bad weather and the reality of enduring\
  \ another five takes a toll on my nerves. Shivering from the rain, our group of\
  \ thirteen managed the reverse psychology of it all. We looked outside from a cabin\
  \ we took shelter in as the rain poured non-stop. The wind-chill factor is arduous,\
  \ but we have to keep moving.\nMt. Ugo\u2019s stretch of connecting towns and various\
  \ villages in-between is a popular hike done in a two-day itinerary. When the sun\
  \ finally showed up after days of incessant rains, skies look promising before our\
  \ departure. Our team comprised a bunch who gear up nicely, even packing up the\
  \ extra weight of high-end cameras to capture the drama of the verdant pine landscapes\
  \ that are worth each cramp. Morning came and the monochrome skies start to tell\
  \ me not to trust weather forecasts again. It is still safe. Sure.  We still proceeded\
  \ at a drunken pace, balancing our footing as the muddy trails doubled up the challenge.\
  \ \nOn a few rest stops, we prayed for a clearing behind the dense fog that stubbornly\
  \ stayed in place, only to give us the gloom of silhouettes and what appears like\
  \ a sinister portal to Silent Hill. Arriving at the open campsite didn\u2019t even\
  \ relieve us. The rain ensued, harder this time. Wind whistled and reminded me of\
  \ typhoons that won\u2019t put me to sleep. Our tents tested aerodynamics, so does\
  \ our fear. That night, our festal meals and booze under the Milky Way didn\u2019\
  t go as planned. Instead, we\u2019re all curled up inside our tents, almost sleepless,\
  \ dreaming of coffee in a nearing hypothermic state.\nThis is only half of our journey\
  \ and morning welcomed us with the same freezing ferocity. No godly spectacle for\
  \ our souls. No Midas touch of sunrise. To cook breakfast is just the best we can\
  \ do to call this hike productive. Under the rain and the shaking arms of the guys\
  \ who acted as tarps and poles to cover us, we have warm meals to get us going through\
  \ the day. \nTen. More. Hours. \nJust when our misery\u2019s about to end at sundown,\
  \ the rain subsided; the bluish sky flaunted its elegance like a bad joke. A fellow\
  \ hiker helplessly stood beside me. His plastic-wrapped camera dangling on his neck.\
  \  \n\u201CNice gear,\u201D I said.\nHe got my sarcasm. \u201CLovely shots.\u201D\
  \ \nSo many memories, zero pictures. We survived, somehow. \nThe rain is our friend.\
  \ The calm follows when we\u2019re no longer there."
