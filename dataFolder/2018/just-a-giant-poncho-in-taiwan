Text: "I'm in Taoyuan, Taiwan with Lynn who I had met briefly three summers before\
  \ and her boyfriend, Henry who I had never met. Henry becomes our interpreter because\
  \ his English is better than Lynn's and my Taiwanese is nonexistent. We will spend\
  \ a night at Lynn's' family home in Hsinchu, near the sea, go to an old mining town,\
  \ visit Taipei, and of course, eat a copious amount of food. On our way to Hsinchu,\
  \ Henry is at the wheel. We are listening to the Backstreet Boys because it's his\
  \ favorite band. I laugh as I look out of the window at the intricately built burial\
  \ houses that I'm told they had to stop building because they were running out of\
  \ space for the living on the island. In Hsinchu they are celebrating Ghost Month\
  \ and we go to the festival with Lynn's family. There is a dead pig on the table\
  \ with incense in its' mouth and a puppet show for the children. The community members\
  \ walk around the table and lay down offerings of candy and fruit. After they make\
  \ their tour, they come up to me. Everyone in the city (it seems) comes up to me\
  \ to shake my hand because I am the first American most of them had ever seen in\
  \ real life. I turn red and stutter out the best 'ni hao' I can manage. I am told\
  \ that I even shook the hand of the mayor. Great. Eventually Henry and Lynn have\
  \ to go back to work and I am left to fend for myself. One morning I wake up to\
  \ a downpour. I would be content to spend the day laying around the house but the\
  \ urge to eat calls me to brave the rain. I put on my large white poncho that is\
  \ plastered with a pharmaceutical brand logo and my shorts that are too short to\
  \ be seen underneath. I slip and slide my way down the block (I do not recommend\
  \ wearing flip flops in a downpour in Taiwan) to the restaurant where I can point\
  \ to pictures of what I want to eat. Every single person is staring at me. I start\
  \ to feel frustrated. I am sick of being stared at; I had caught people taking pictures\
  \ of me and of course I was singled-out during the Ghost Month celebrations. I get\
  \ back to the apartment and I'm furious. I'll be leaving in two days but I will\
  \ go to Japan for another two weeks which will certainly be more of the same. I'm\
  \ feeling sorry for myself until a thought creeps into my head. I\u2019ve been staring\
  \ right back. I\u2019ve been taking pictures and gawking at people as much as they\
  \ have been gawking at me. They have every right to stare; I'm the outsider. My\
  \ anger subsides as I realize how lucky I am to call Lynn and Henry my friends."
