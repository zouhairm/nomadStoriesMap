Text: "In November 2017, my husband I traveled to Kauai.  Beforehand, we had asked\
  \ people where to go, what to see....and I had been there before, so we had some\
  \ ideas of what to do.  \nAfter we arrived, we began our quest for the best burgers,\
  \ the most beautiful hikes, and secluded beaches.  Locals gave us ideas for all\
  \ of these and we were not disappointed.\nAt a gas station, near where we stayed\
  \ in Princeville, I devoured the most incredible burger.  Ever!  We ate there three\
  \ times during our stay.  We also tried burgers at several other locations, being\
  \ a repeat customer at Ono's as well.  Needless to say, the most incredible burgers\
  \ and fries can be found in Kauai! \nWe hiked to Queens Bath, Secret Beach, and\
  \ other touristy places.  Our best hikes were when we took public roads to the end,\
  \ and then continued on the dirt paths.  We always stayed on public roads, but we\
  \ found waterfalls and views more stunning than any postcard, and we were there\
  \ alone.  Hiking shoes are a must, unless you are comfortable hiking barefoot. \
  \ There is no in between!\nAs we traversed the dirt roads, we also came upon secluded\
  \ (public!) beaches where we were the only ones there.  We stumbled upon a monk\
  \ seal basking in the sun and we cleared beaches of washed up debris.  We definitely\
  \ found the most beautiful spots by taking the road less traveled.\nWe also discovered\
  \ that you can stay at any number of beautiful public parks on the beach for $22\
  \ a night!  The next time we go, we will definitely take advantage of this find!\n\
  We loved finding the places that the typical tourist knows nothing about.  We went\
  \ to farmer's markets and learned what brought people to Kauai, and why they stayed.\
  \  We fell in love with Kauai and cannot wait to go back!"
