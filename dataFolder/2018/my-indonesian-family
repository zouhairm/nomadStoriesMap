Text: "Four years ago, when i got the friend request on facebook from a guy in Indonesia,\
  \ I could never have imagined what it would lead me to.\n\nDuring the Christmas\
  \ of 2017. I had my tickets booked, I was flying in to meet and live with a guy,\
  \ and his family, whom I've only spoken to through facebook. The thought scared\
  \ me, but more than that, it excited me. The traveler inside of me screamed for\
  \ more adventures and here I was, with the tickets in my hand, ready.\n\nI did not\
  \ know what to expect as I went, but my hopes were high, and what I experienced\
  \ was far better than I could've ever dreamed of. \n\nThe people of Indonesia, were\
  \ all happy, smiling, friendly people. They all looked at me as if I was a celebrity,\
  \ they came up to me to shake my hand, take my picture and they thanked me dearly\
  \ for it. They shared their foods with me, excellent food, and they took me around\
  \ to see the beauty of their world. \n\nMy friend, and his family, took me in without\
  \ hesitation. Gave me a bed to sleep in, food on my plate, and asked of nothing\
  \ in return. They took me to monuments, bought me souvenirs and I was invited to\
  \ a wedding, a day I will never forget. In an Indonesian wedding, the bride and\
  \ groom walks together to where the guests are, followed by their family members\
  \ in line. And who, if not me, were asked to walk side by side with the soon-to-be\
  \ husband and wife? I felt happy to be there, and I was surprised they'd give me\
  \ such honor. Later we took pictures, and a lot of pictures it became. \n\nI got\
  \ accustomed to my friend, and to his family. Despite not speaking much English,\
  \ they all did their best to make me feel at home, and at home they made me feel.\
  \ A family of which I could not communicate to with words, but with my heart."
