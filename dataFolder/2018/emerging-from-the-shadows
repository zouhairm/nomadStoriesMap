Text: "I stood on the mountaintop and watched the sun slipping behind the Coast Mountain\
  \ Ranges in a blaze of lilac and gold. Up here, above the tree line, at an altitude\
  \ of 6,000 feet, there was no water to be found - it was all down in the valleys,\
  \ in the streams and lakes. I tilted my stainless steel water bottle and the last\
  \ trickle dribbled into my mouth. \n\nI was in the backcountry of British Columbia,\
  \ standing on the boundary between Whistler Mountain Resort and Garibaldi Provincial\
  \ Park. I was only about two hours drive from my home in Vancouver, but I was definitely\
  \ in the wilderness, and I was very much alone.\n\nA few months prior, my long-term\
  \ girlfriend had left me for another man. Jackie and I had hiked together through\
  \ Canada, the United States, Australia, Thailand and Vietnam. This new guy was also\
  \ a hiker, but all the mountains he'd scaled were bigger than mine and Jackie told\
  \ me his hiking style was akin to that of a mountain goat. I'd been traded in for\
  \ the new model.\n\nWith summer drawing to a close, and no new hiking partner in\
  \ sight, I decided to take an epic hike all by myself. I hastily threw together\
  \ some provisions, rode an afternoon gondola to the top of Whistler mountain and\
  \ struck out into the wild.\n\nBefore I was even halfway to the campsite, the sun\
  \ disappeared and the green valleys below turned to black. The air was cooler now,\
  \ and my sweat chilled me as I dragged my boots through the dust and rubble. A half\
  \ moon rose over the snow-capped peaks, illuminating the trail as it led down into\
  \ the dark forest. As I slipped silently between the twisted pines, my hands instinctively\
  \ moved to my waistband - one on my diving knife, the other on my bear spray. I\
  \ moved gracefully and with purpose, eyes fully dilated, equal parts animal and\
  \ man.\n\nI emerged from the forest into a field of moon-lit boulders, trimmed with\
  \ a spiky silhouette of subalpine firs, under a dome of countless stars. I stopped\
  \ for a moment to catch my breath, marvelling at the galaxies above. To my surprise,\
  \ some of the stars were moving in time with my laboured breath. Fearing that I\
  \ was beginning to hallucinate, I continued along the trail at a much slower rate.\n\
  \nIn the next valley, I saw more lights, these ones dancing around like fireflies.\
  \ I stumbled and tripped my way towards the lights with a huge grin on my face.\
  \ They're not fireflies - they're people! People with headlamps! I was finally at\
  \ the campsite and I\u2019d never been so happy to see strangers in all my life!"
