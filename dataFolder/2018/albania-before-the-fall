Text: "I was living in Greece in the mid to late 70s next to the most isolated country\
  \ in Europe \u2013 the Communist Stalinist State of Albania. To most of Europe \
  \ Albania was as far removed as the Dark Side of the Moon. I had long been fascinated\
  \ by the concept of a hermetically sealed country such as Albania and wondered how\
  \ I might be possible to take a peek inside.\n\nEnthralled at living so close to\
  \ the end of the known world, I sought permission for me and a couple of friends\
  \ to visit the Albanian border at Kakavia where we might understand something that\
  \ was to me incomprehensible.\n \nHaving prised the necessary permits to drive into\
  \ the demilitarised zone we drove off on a crisp autumnal morning in my copper coloured\
  \ UK-registered Ford Escort to the border We were young, fearless and a tad reckless\
  \ and we didn\u2019t care too much about politics but we were interested in humanity.\n\
  \nWe were summarily stopped a couple of times by the military, but our documents\
  \ passed muster and we made it to the imposing Greek watchtower that sat overlooking\
  \ the iron and wooden fence that separated two widely different political systems.\n\
  \ \nThe border was a rather nondescript, but solid wood and iron gate beyond which\
  \ a neglected roadway led, after some 50 metres, to another solid-looking wood and\
  \ iron gate. A sandstone Albanian watchtower to the left looked over at us as we\
  \ stared into their blank utopian Communist world.\n \nIt was rumoured that the\
  \ village of Bodrisht\xEB on the plain visible below Kakavia had a bus painted two\
  \ colours. Red on one side and yellow on the other. It was rumoured to drive one\
  \ way then back the other way to convince that Greeks that Albanians were well off\
  \ and owned two vehicles. In retrospect, it was probably urban myth. As it happened\
  \ we saw no sign of life other than the brown-clad Albanian border guards watching\
  \ us furtively from their command post.\n \nLooking into an Albania frozen in time\
  \ and locked into communist political dictatorship from the comfort of the top of\
  \ the Greek watchtower was a truly surreal and sobering experience. Blank empty\
  \ fields, diminutive houses scattered almost at random and not a sign of human life.\
  \ The free world as I knew it ended here in front of me. I could not fathom that\
  \ beyond the scruffy and out-of-bounds roadway lay an actual prison-state. I was\
  \ humbled and for the first time ever understood the vast divide that then still\
  \ separated post WWII Europe and its implications on otherwise normal humans living\
  \ side by side."
