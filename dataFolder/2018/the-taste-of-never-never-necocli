Text: "\u201CNecocl\xED is known for only one thing: a massacre back in 1994 and the\
  \ poem that goes with it. Six lines. Seven people dead. Carranza, the poet\u2019\
  s name. No one goes overthere. Just ask: no one really knows where... what is Necocl\xED\
  .\u201D Someone knew something, apparently: I met Edier in one of the most isolated\
  \ part of La Nacho (the National University of Bogota). \u201CSeems I\u2019m not\
  \ the only one attracted to hidden places,\u201D I thought. He\u2019s young \u2013\
  \ born in 1994 actually \u2013 and still he knows about the poem, the story. The\
  \ one who told me about the small village on the Caribbean sea in the first place?\
  \ The friend of a friend of a friend. \u201CMy mother lives up there,\u201D he said.\
  \ \u201CShe\u2019s weird, it\u2019s a strange place; you would like it I guess.\u201D\
  \ There I go. Bus ticket. Bogota. Medellin. Necocl\xED.\nIt\u2019s not so hard to\
  \ reach that place where \u2013 \u201Cturistically\u201D speaking \u2013 nobody\
  \ goes. I have to pass a few tests (the bus ticket seller, a lady in the bus, always\
  \ the same question: \u201CWhy on earth this place?\u201D). Finding my not-so-close-friend\u2019\
  s mother is not so easy. \u201CYou\u2019re looking for Claudia? The witch?\u201D\
  \ Someone shows me a slippery steep slope (hill? jungle?). I climb my way up to\
  \ an open wooden house: no doors, no windows, several knives and brooms on the floor.\
  \ I don\u2019t dare to enter. Don\u2019t have the time to think about it neither:\
  \ someone is climbing the same way I climbed, much quicker. \u201CI found you,\u201D\
  \ she says. The son and friend just called five minutes earlier to tell \u201Csomeone\
  \ was coming\u201D. She gets a machete under the brooms; there are many coconuts\
  \ ready to be eaten on the floor. I ask about the flowers I don\u2019t know yet.\
  \ About the \u201Cwitch thing\u201D too. \u201CI had my friend\u2019s little boys\
  \ sleeping at my place a few years ago.\u201D One and three years old. One of the\
  \ two tore a Rolling Stones poster she had on the wall. \u201CI\u2019ve been shouting\
  \ on every single beach I was going to drown both of them. The poster was a serious\
  \ thing to me. But there are very few people living here, so if you\u2019re mean\
  \ only one time, you\u2019re mean for real.\u201D\nThe next day, she\u2019s the\
  \ nicest person on earth: she puts me on the water, after arranging things with\
  \ a group of fishermen. I\u2019m coming back to Necocl\xED, that\u2019s for sure.\
  \ But the weather is just perfect to go straight to Panama on a very small wooden\
  \ boat. \u201CJust one hour, and you\u2019ll reach the coast. Real tourists can\
  \ only go by bus. One gets accustomed, the nature is changing very softly. You?\
  \ You\u2019ll see get the picture blown up right in your face.\u201D"
