Text: "I have been an enthusiastic girl who\u2019s always looking for magic. In fact,\
  \ never stopped believing in magic. I feel, if you have the power to dream, you\
  \ sure will have the strength to make them come true and with this perfect combination\
  \ of dream and strength, magic is bound to happen.\nMy dream wasn\u2019t a big,\
  \ seemingly unachievable one. I just wanted to go and watch my favorite band play\
  \ live. To my surprise, Coldplay decided to perform in India, but not to my surprise,\
  \ my parents refused for me to go. That\u2019s when magic came to play. My brother\
  \ in Singapore bought me tickets to the concert there.\n\nThe traveller inside of\
  \ me jumped, almost a year of meticulous planning, saving money, research and overthinking\
  \ gave me goose bumps. I couldn\u2019t control my excitement. I covered the touristy\
  \ part of Singapore in the first 4 days. The country is smaller than the city I\
  \ live in, it wasn\u2019t that difficult a job anyway. On the night of the fourth\
  \ day, I sat with my brother enjoying a glass of beer and his usual elder brother\
  \ talk. I had one more day to go before the concert, he asked me to visit the Tree\
  \ Top Walk of MacRitchie Reservoir. My overly adventurous self, conveniently neglected\
  \ the intensity of the trek and the size of that nature reserve.\nThe next morning,\
  \ I trickled out of the bed, my legs hurt from the incessant walking that I wasn\u2019\
  t used to. I made myself breakfast and decided against taking a bath because I was\
  \ going to sweat, or so I expected. I grabbed my undercharged phone, assuming to\
  \ be back in three hours along with my earphones and left for the nature reserve.\
  \ As soon as I began the trek, it started drizzling. I continued walking and the\
  \ drizzle soon became a shower. It took two hours for me to reach the tree top and\
  \ I was soaking wet. As I walked on the bridge, a few feet above this huge expanse\
  \ of rain forest, I was all alone but I could breathe.\n\nOn my way back, I had\
  \ to walk through the forest on wet wooden walks that they had created, I got lost.\
  \ It took another two and a half hours for me to get back. My phone was dead, I\
  \ was tired, drenched, didn't have food or water. But, I was enjoying. Enjoying\
  \ the slight chill, the water trickling on my skin, my soaked hair, the smell of\
  \ the rain forest, sounds of the leaves rusting, birds singing and insects enjoying.\
  \ I was dancing in the rain. I felt free and alive and realised that the adventure\
  \ of the journey is better than the destination. That day, I felt free to be me.\
  \ I fell in love with myself."
