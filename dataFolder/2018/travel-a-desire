Text: "Traveling is a dream come true to me. I started traveling at the age of 12\
  \ and since then I loved it very much. Behind every travel there is a reason or\
  \ a purpose which drives oneself achieve it. Some people succeed in finding the\
  \ purpose and for others, the travel becomes just a trip. I have traveled to multiple\
  \ places in India and yes, I found my purpose. Every travel taught me something\
  \ or the other, which did add value to my life.\n\nThis is a small story about my\
  \ trip to Visakhapatnam. I was assigned an assignment here. I had an incredible\
  \ experience during my stay for about 3 months. My trip was scheduled for 5th July,\
  \ 2017. I boarded the flight from Calcutta airport at 10 a.m. It was 2 hours and\
  \ 30 minutes flight to Visakhapatnam. After landing on time at the airport, I reached\
  \ the company lodge at 2 p.m. I was new and it was my very first day. I introduced\
  \ myself and finally made few new friends on the same day. Slowly and gradually\
  \ as time passed by, I made friends from outside work place i.e. the locals. The\
  \ locals were very supportive and friendly to me. In no time, I became inquisitive\
  \ about their cultural traditions followed by the unique food recipes and etc. Seeing\
  \ this, the locals got more interested into me. They helped understand their culture\
  \ and learn their language. There are many famous dishes which are mouth watering,\
  \ unique, hygienic and healthy. Few of them are Idly, Dosa, Hyderabadi Dum and Chicken\
  \ Biryani etc. The locals helped me learn to cook the dishes too. It was a great\
  \ experience. Finally I was able to make a good connection.\n\nVisakhapatnam is\
  \ one of the famous tourist destinations in India. It attracts foreign tourists\
  \ too. Tourist places to visit here are INS Kursura, VUDA Park, Kailashgiri, R.K.\
  \ beach, Bheemli beach and many more. The landscapes, sea beaches, monuments are\
  \ amazing. According to my experience I would suggest, one who visits Visakhapatnam\
  \ must visit Bheemli beach and go for boat riding into the Bay of Bengal. You will\
  \ enjoy because it\u2019s full of thrill and adventure.  One should have Visakhapatnam\
  \ as travel destination in their travel bucket list. \n\nTraveling has lots of impact\
  \ on one\u2019s life. It has enabled me to meet new people who came from different\
  \ backgrounds, cultures etc. Traveling has added adventure and thrill to my life.\
  \ It helped me become a better person. Overall it has shaped me as person. If I\
  \ get an opportunity to travel, I would love to travel often and become a travel\
  \ writer. \n\nThank You"
