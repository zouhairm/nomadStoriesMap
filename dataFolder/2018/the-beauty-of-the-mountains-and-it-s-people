Text: "Having enjoyed the view for a while near the camp, situated on a conflux of\
  \ river Ganga and one of its tributaries, outside Rishikesh, I decided to head on\
  \ for a short trek (1.5 kms one side from the motorable road) in The Rajaji National\
  \ Park. It leads to the Patna Waterfalls, named after the nearby village Patna.\n\
  \ \nThis trek runs parallel to the spring, lush greenery bordering it. Birds chirping\
  \ and waters gushing felt like a perfect musical concert sponsored by nature.\n\
  \ \nGoing along, I met a lone villager on his way back to the village in the park.\
  \ We walked along, talking about the life over there.\n \nHe said \"A few days back,\
  \ I saw three Tigers crossing this path, they come in search of food. Sometimes\
  \ they feed on our cattle and this is the only way for us to commute.\"\n \nA strange\
  \ thought jumped into my mind saying \u201CWhat if we meet tigers on our way now!!!?\u201D\
  \n \nThis thought faded away as we were joined by few more villagers, one septuagenarian!\n\
  \ \nSurprised, I shot the villager back with another question,\n\"Then, how do you\
  \ carry necessary goods and materials to build houses and stuff.!\u201D\nHe replied,\
  \ \"Sir, khachars (mules) are used for carrying stuff up to the villages and we\
  \ have no other way to do it, well we are used to it, that's life up here.\"\n \n\
  It is their daily life, a village of around 200 people, 4 kms up inside the forest,\
  \ some villages ahead, this trek, short, but not an easy one.\n \nWorrisome fact\
  \ is that, Rishikesh, a Yoga hub is flocked with tourists all around the year. Yet\
  \ there is a village nearby and the only way to reach it is by a trek and nothing\
  \ seems to deter these smiles.\n\nBidding bye to the villagers, I took a detour\
  \ to reach the waterfalls, it was a delight to watch and the view filled my soul\
  \ with peace. \nWandering around, found a small tea shop, talking to the shopkeeper,\
  \ I complimented him on the tea, it was by far the best tea I have had in my entire\
  \ day of travel. He responded with a smile,\n \n \"Sir, I have no interest to earn\
  \ more by adding water to the milk that I use in preparing tea. I prefer it served\
  \ here, the way I have it myself at home. I am happy and this tea is the only way\
  \ a person coming here will remember me or my shop. I love this feeling, when someone\
  \ enjoys it, just like the waterfalls here!\"\n \nAmazed and smiling, I left from\
  \ there thinking, how the happiness lies in small things. The beauty of the mountains\
  \ and the simplicity of the people here displayed it. That's how this journey has\
  \ become a part of me."
