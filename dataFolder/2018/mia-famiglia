Text: "Both of my parents died before I was nine. I was raised by my stepmom. With\
  \ so little family, I clung to the Italian heritage of my grandparents and what\
  \ they were able to pass down before passing away themselves. \nIn 2015 when my\
  \ daughter was studying abroad in Italy, I jumped at the opportunity to join her.\
  \ We planned to venture around central Italy, but I wanted more. \nFacebook is a\
  \ powerful thing. You can look at memes and connect with people from anywhere. I\
  \ logged on and searched people with the last name DiGiustili (my grandfather\u2019\
  s last name) in Italy. The magic of the Internet revealed a list of people. It was\
  \ a long shot but I messaged them. I even had my daughter translate the message\
  \ to Italian. \nWeeks passed but Facebook was silent. Then one day the little red\
  \ box popped up on my messages. It was an Italian girl. After some messaging back\
  \ and forth (thankfully she spoke English), we had discovered that we were in fact\
  \ related. \nMonths later I found myself pacing in the beautiful but tiny mountainous\
  \ town of Spelonga, Italy. We were to meet the Italian girl here. I peered out onto\
  \ the sunlit mountains protruding gallantly into the sky, the little houses scattered\
  \ across the road, and the old man working in a garden like he probably had every\
  \ day of his life for the past 50 years. Then we saw them.\n  When the car drew\
  \ to a stop, our two groups collided and greetings of labored Italian and English\
  \ were exchanged. Together we walked down the one winding road to the house where\
  \ my grandfather had grown up and where family still lived. I met cousins, aunts,\
  \ uncles, spouses. It became so complex we drew a family tree to keep the connections\
  \ straight. For the girl with 2 dead parents, I now had too many relatives to count.\
  \ \n That night we feasted. There were cheeses, meats, pastas, bread, and wine lining\
  \ the long table as we all gathered around. It was enough food to feed the entire\
  \ village, and it felt like the whole village could have been there. \nIt didn\u2019\
  t matter that we didn\u2019t speak the same language. It didn\u2019t matter that\
  \ I could not utter more than 2 words to them. What mattered was the unspoken bond\
  \ between us, the acknowledgement and love exchanged in our eyes, and the touching\
  \ sentiment that these people, although strangers just a few hours ago, were my\
  \ family. In this tiny village in Italy, I finally found what I had been missing.\
  \ Here was mia famiglia."
