Text: "\"I am warm, I am warm,\u201D the mantra I recite, knee deep in 45\u2109 water.\
  \  Ahead, I see Jaime assessing a hobbit sized hole in the cavern. A splash from\
  \ behind awakens chills on my back. We\u2019re 700 feet below, in the labyrinth\
  \ of middle earth, when I\u2019m pushed to the brink of human endurance. \n\nIt\
  \ was thrilling to spring between the realms of light and darkness while repelled\
  \ in the deepest sinkhole of New Zealand, even exciting to climb over waterfalls\
  \ and around pools in complete blackness. Waiting to squeeze into an inconceivable\
  \ hole is plainly terrifying. I\u2019m panini pressed between two slices of thick\
  \ rock thinking back to our tramp through the beech forest of Abel Tasman National\
  \ Park. Carabiners jingled at our waist while Neil, our guide and Nelson local,\
  \ casually prepared us for the mission. All ten of us felt the 7.8 earthquake a\
  \ month ago, but no one brought up the fear of aftershocks. We\u2019ve made it through\
  \ six hours in the cave; waiting for the exit is brutal. My breath escapes my body\
  \ as Jaime enters the tunnel and Val slips into a pool behind me. \n\nMost of us\
  \ met today, and we've completely relied on each other to navigate an alien underworld.\
  \ I help Val onto a welcome mat of uneven rock sprouting from the ground, shivers\
  \ rippling from her palms to mine. After several deep breaths, we shine our spotlights\
  \ on the source of dripping from above. My claustrophobia stretches into awe, counting\
  \ the icicle-shaped deposits on the roof. We look back at the waterfall, surrounded\
  \ by thousands of glistening pillars that must\u2019ve taken decades to form. It\u2019\
  s magical to follow an underground path carved out by water, a world that so few\
  \ humans see.\n\nJaime\u2019s yell means it\u2019s go time. Completely desensitized\
  \ to the water, I lie belly down and crawl through the stream. Feeling the weight\
  \ of the earth enclosed around me, I teeter between panic and laughter. Loose stones\
  \ shuffle against my shins while my heartbeat resonates in my skull. I concentrate\
  \ on contorting my body, pulling my limbs through the tunnel as quickly as possible.\
  \ \n\nI blink twice, sure that I\u2019m imagining a glitter of sunlight ahead. Desperation\
  \ launches me towards the opening. An overwhelming sense of relief comes from walking\
  \ into true warmth. I sprawl under the sun rays in utter disbelief of how easily\
  \ Neil had downplayed the challenging mission. While my decision to plunge into\
  \ Harwood\u2019s hole took me to the edge of earth, it was the moments of waiting\
  \ beneath it that truly tested my perseverance."
