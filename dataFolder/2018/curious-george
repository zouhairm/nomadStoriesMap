Text: "\u201CDarn,\u201D I muttered to myself.  Two gorillas I hoped to identify,\
  \ an adult male and female, slipped back into the dense, green tangle of forest\
  \ across the bai.  The male was still visible enough to see him look my way every\
  \ few minutes.  Was he thinking, \u201CWhat the heck is that?\u201D\n\nMe?  A pale,\
  \ white ape perched on a platform, 13 meters above the forest floor, in clear view.\
  \  From my tree-office, I could see all in this 12 hectare, marshy clearing in northern\
  \ Congo.  But once the gorillas entered the forest, forget it!  Their black skin\
  \ and hair, with a peppering of gray along the backs of mature males (silverbacks),\
  \ let even the heftiest gorilla blend into the forest shadows.  These two did the\
  \ same vanishing act last week!\n\nI scanned the forest with my scope hoping for\
  \ another glimpse of the male.  Twenty minutes, nothing.  Then, a rustling in the\
  \ vines at the base of a tree opposite me!  I zoomed in there.  There he sat amid\
  \ the tall grasses calmly watching me!\n\nMore time passed. We both sat watching\
  \ until, something totally unexpected.  He began to climb the tree, pausing every\
  \ few meters to look my way!  It wasn\u2019t his climbing that surprised me but\
  \ that he seemed to want to get a better view of me!  Hand over beefy hand he continued\
  \ his ascent to the first crook that fit his body.  There he sat at almost the same\
  \ level as me!  Occasionally he shifted position or scratched a shaggy black-haired\
  \ arm, all the while observing his observer!  We took turns looking away to ease\
  \ any tension.  Direct eye contact in gorilla body language is considered a threat.\
  \  I named him Curious George, CG for short!\n\nCG\u2019s curiosity gave me a good\
  \ look at his black, leathery face and other features.  His saggital crest was low\
  \ and round, brow-ridge gently arched over eyes.  Short hair on the sides of his\
  \ crest, black, the top highlighted a vibrant orange.  These features would help\
  \ me recognize him when he returned.      \n\nMinutes passed.  I sat like a rock.\
  \  Inside, I was bouncing up and down, so excited!  Could I get some video of CG?\
  \  It meant moving my body and the camera.  Would CG remain calm?  There was one\
  \ way to know.  I slowly stood.  CG watched me intently. Up was OK but then I stepped\
  \ toward the camera.\n \n\u201CWhaa,\u201D CG\u2019s high-pitched alarm bark cut\
  \ through the dense air.  He slid down the tree at twice the speed he\u2019d climbed\
  \ it.  One more glance at me as he thudded to the ground and retreated to the forest.\
  \  Enough curiosity for today but he would be back!"
