Text: "I travelled to Japan to escape the local, the familiar, the predictable. Staggering\
  \ under my ambitious backpack, or perhaps under the morning-after haze induced by\
  \ a night of sake, I tripped into Hiroshima station one grizzly August morning.\
  \ No self-respecting English Lit graduate could have walked through those beautiful,\
  \ almost empty streets in the relentless rain without acknowledging a hint of pathetic\
  \ fallacy. I had known Hiroshima would be different; I had read enough about August\
  \ 1945 to anticipate a place upturned by a pivotal moment in world history. I had\
  \ expected to feel moved, of course, but somehow alienated by Hiroshima\u2019s incomprehensibility.\
  \  It had been torn apart, rendered unrecognisable, whilst my ancestors sat unharmed.\
  \ I felt as though an impenetrable distance separated me from Hiroshima, and this\
  \ distance I sought to respect. \nThis was my first voyage of independence away\
  \ from my na\xEFve undergraduate self, and had expected few reminders of home. I\
  \ took in the ruins and memorial sites of Hiroshima, feeling at once humbled and\
  \ devastated. Where I expected alienation, even guilt, I experienced a shared process\
  \ of mourning. Walking slowly, trying to make sense of my strange place in this\
  \ city, I was suddenly transported back to my Dad\u2019s living room fifteen years\
  \ ago. Don\u2019t worry, this is not science fiction. It\u2019s a metaphor.\n\u201C\
  My baby\u2019s good to me, you know, she\u2019s happy as can be, you know, she said\
  \ so\u201D \nThe Beatles\u2019 'I Feel Fine', one of the defining songs of my childhood,\
  \ was serenading Japanese shoppers from the tannoy of a corner shop as they browsed,\
  \ indifferent. Resisting the urge to recreate a legendary living room dance routine,\
  \ I hummed along quietly. The elderly shop owner beamed with enthusiasm, \u201C\
  You\u2019re English? You like The Beatles?\u201D\nI smiled back, \u201CI love them!\
  \ I\u2019m from Liverpool!\u201D\nThis was the best thing I could have said. As\
  \ I soon learned, this man was a huge fan of Liverpool football club. Forget English\
  \ cultural assumptions of my hometown: he adored Liverpool as I adored Japan. As\
  \ we talked, I felt an affinity and connection which transcended racial, gendered\
  \ and generational boundaries. Hiroshima had taught me to learn from the legacy\
  \ of disaster: but more importantly to look difference in the face and challenge\
  \ it, accept it and celebrate it. We shouldn\u2019t erase uncomfortable parts of\
  \ our shared history, but seek to change them. This man taught me to alter my perspectives\
  \ of my own city as much as my views of his."
