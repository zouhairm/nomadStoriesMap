Text: "I woke up under a dense woven ceiling of branches. The sunlight filtered through\
  \ in small chutes giving a glimpse of the blue sky above the treetops. I slept with\
  \ my companions, a group of 4 other women, including myself, and a translator whom\
  \ we picked up at the Bangkok airport upon our arrival. He stood with the other\
  \ taxi drivers and private escorts at the welcome area, with a single sign that\
  \ read \u201Ctranslate\u201D in English and in Thai transcript. \nWe knew little\
  \ about him, as he kept mostly quiet. However, on the night train from Bangkok to\
  \ Chiang Mai, I overheard a conversation with him, and one of my friends. He was\
  \ a Mahout, the \u201Celephant trainers\u201D of South East Asia. Their relationship\
  \ with their elephants is pure and loyal. As per tradition, the Mahout is awarded\
  \ their elephant as they come of age. From that point on they are expected to work,\
  \ and send money back home for their families. However, as the forestry industry\
  \ pushes into sacred land, and elephant labor is phased slowly out of the industry,\
  \ the Mahout find themselves making the long and dangerous journey from the Chiang\
  \ Mai and Kanchanaburi regions and into Bangkok. On my first day in Bangkok I watched\
  \ a Mahout, mounted on the back of his companion, as I sat on the top level of a\
  \ double decker bus. From where I sat, the Mahout was about my level, and he glanced\
  \ over at me as he gently tapped the elephant\u2019s rear with a leather staff.\
  \ \nHis name was Inthanon, and like many other Mahout before him he made the trek\
  \ with his elephant into Bangkok. There they set up a makeshift camp outside of\
  \ a tourist frequented night market in the city. Inthanon begged for food, and when\
  \ tour buses arrived and tourists poured out, his loyal friend kneeled and posed,\
  \ and cameras flashed as eager tourists stood in line for a photo with his elephant.\
  \ On a journey back to Chiang Mai, where his family lived, a truck lost control\
  \ on a steep mountain incline. The truck struck Inthanon\u2019s elephant square,\
  \ before hitting the side of the mountain, from there it turned on its side and\
  \ stopped. \n At the end of his story he fell silent. The car of the night train\
  \ where I lay swayed and screeched in the new silence, and every few seconds a light\
  \ from outside traced patterns on the inside of my bunk.\nBut now we lay a few feet\
  \ apart, on a quiet morning under the damp canopy of a new day. Birds sang, and\
  \ the distant and ominous chants of the monks on the hillside of the monastery were\
  \ swept in with the warm wind."
