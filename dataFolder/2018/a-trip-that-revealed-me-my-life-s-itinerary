Text: "I was 12 then. When I was selected in a lucky draw for being part of our school\
  \ migration batch that year. We, a batch of 20 are supposed to go to a far away\
  \ school, a thousand miles away. Stay for ten complete months. Our journey started.\
  \ So is mine, half-heartedly.\n        Life again became a routine for first few\
  \ days again until one weekend when most of our wardens were on a leave. We saw\
  \ the scope of jumping off the school's boundary wall and yes, we did it. For the\
  \ First time, I've crossed the Boundaries, both Physical and mental. We, group of\
  \ four like-minded friends had been to a nearby lake. Never have I felt so free\
  \ in my life ever. Those moments brought the craziest one out of me. It was then\
  \ I realized Traveling isn't about just moving physically from one place to other.\
  \ It was something much beyond that, which introduces us to our inner self. We were\
  \ back to school in the midnight without getting caught luckily.\n     Since then,\
  \ Jumping off that wall became our routine. If that poor boundary wall had a life,\
  \ It'd be like \"No, Not again! It's twentieth time already\". We covered almost\
  \ every potential tourist place in the radius of 50 miles around us. Our week was\
  \ simple. Leaving the campus by 4 am in the Sunday morning, Chilling out the entire\
  \ day, returning by midnight, followed by tiry Mondays, waiting-for-Sunday weekdays,\
  \ exciting Saturdays. The most Fantasizing one is the on the new year's eve where\
  \ we slipped into an ongoing party, escaping the guards. That breathtaking EDM brought\
  \ the dancer out of me. For a 12-year-old, that was one hell of an experience. So\
  \ many memories tight packed within a year. That year ended in no time and we are\
  \ back to our school again, visiting those memories once in a while.\n      I'm\
  \ 18 now and I've traveled thousands of miles already and explored so many places\
  \ in India. Despite so many restrictions, mostly Financial, I never stopped. I tend\
  \ to snatch every chance to take a break. I regret no trip. I'm not born with wings\
  \ under my arms. But, Apparently, I'm born with wheels under my feet. What if I\
  \ backed off that day or stayed still? So many What-ifs but I chose the right ones.\
  \ No, I made the ones I chose right. That's the thing with Life. It has some hidden\
  \ tricky plans waiting for you. You Just have to be smart enough to discover them.\
  \ I'm still grateful for the decision that I've made which pushed me to the edge\
  \ of my comfort zone and revealed me my life's itinerary."
