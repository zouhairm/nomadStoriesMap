Text: "It\u2019s not uncommon when travelling, for people to give tips on where to\
  \ go and what to see. When checking out of a hostel in the Manuel Antonio region\
  \ of Costa Rica, blurry eyed from a hellish night\u2019s sleep in an ant infested\
  \ bed, my polite small talk with the receptionist about my plan that day to travel\
  \ north to the mountainous town of Monteverde, led to a recommendation that I should\
  \ check out a \u2018magical\u2019 tree on the outskirts of the town. Before I knew\
  \ it, the receptionist grabbed a napkin and scribbled a map of directions to the\
  \ tree. Monteverde is renowned for its pristine cloud forests, but I was sceptical\
  \ of the idea that there was one specific tree worthy of a visit. Nonetheless, I\
  \ shoved the napkin into my pocket and didn\u2019t give it another thought.\nStepping\
  \ off the bus into the fresh mountain air, I set about planning activities for my\
  \ short stay. My main agenda; to book onto one of the many \u2018extreme\u2019 zip\
  \ lining experiences in the area. The promise of an adrenaline fuelled afternoon\
  \ excited me, however I found myself with a few hours to kill. With not much to\
  \ do in town, I remembered the recommendation of the receptionist and grabbed the\
  \ napkin from my pocket.\nFollowing the primitive map of directions, I walked in\
  \ the heat of the midday sun to the outskirts of town and entered a dense area of\
  \ forest. Tired and hot, my enthusiasm to see this \u2018magical\u2019 tree was\
  \ ebbing as the ridiculousness of the situation; trying to find a tree in a forest,\
  \ dawned on me! My scepticism soon vanished however, as my eyes set upon a clearing,\
  \ and in the centre, a truly enchanting tree. The base, a labyrinth of what looked\
  \ like tree roots, rising out of the ground creating a lattice of tree trunks, each\
  \ the width of an arm, beautifully woven together to form a reverse rabbit hole\
  \ into the sky! I scurried to the base like an excited child. It was clear from\
  \ the muddy footprints of previous visitors that you could climb within the tree\u2019\
  s structure into the forest canopy above. Slowly, I ascended high into the tree,\
  \ my heart in my mouth as I carefully placed each hand and foot, the passage narrowing\
  \ as I gained height. The view as I emerged alone, above the tree canopy was breath\
  \ taking. \nMy visit to the tree turned out to be a highlight of my Central American\
  \ trip.  The experience created a rush of adrenaline far superior to the \u2018\
  extreme\u2019 zip lining that afternoon, and reminded me that sometimes, the most\
  \ memorable parts of a trip can happen when you least expect."
