  \ visit Bir billing for the greatest experience of paragliding....it is the place\
  \ located near Dharmshala district of Himachal pradesh but by a chance our trip\
  \ got cancelled due to republic day preparation and security reason paragliding\
  \ was closed so we werereturning towards our house...but within a second we got\
  \ an Idea to visit Auli as this is the time when we start towards a very beautifully\
  \ design place in the laps of great Himalaya near Badrinath temple in joshimath....\n\
  We started our journey in the new maruti suzuki baleno with all the stuff .... Its\
  \ around 7 pm when we started moving from delhi towards auli on NH 58 ...we bpth\
  \ are so excited ....\nTrip Itinerary:\n\n24th Jan 2018 -  Delhi to. Joshimath at\
  \ 7 pm\n\n25th Jan 2018- reached Joshimath 11 am.\n\n25th Jan 2018 - 1 pm car stucked\
  \ in Ice.\n\n2 pm- parked our car near by and started to track towards Auli. Tracking\
  \ was awesomely good.\n\nAccomodation:  \n\nAuli - Garhwal Mandal Vikas Nigam (GMVN).\
  \ Deluxeroom was booked on 25th Jan.its much difficult to spend night without a\
  \ room heater as the temperature as low as -12\xB0C .\nOn 26th morning after experiencing\
  \ the grat place auli stated to move towards delhi.\n\nThere are only 2 hotels on\
  \ the top - in Auli and you can just get yourself a room in any of these 2 hotels.\
  \ You can just relax and take in the beauty of the mountains and eat hot-hot Maggie,\
  \ pakoras, chai and contemplate and maybe read a book or click pictures or paint.\
  \ Another activity that one can go for is skiing when there is enough snow. Mostly\
  \ around January - March. Check with GMVN on this and they can help you with arrangements.\n\
  \nHaridwar\nWitness the Ganga Aarti at Har Ki Pauri - happens at 5 PM everyday (we\
  \ had almost missed it). Also, walk around the lanes in Har Ki Pauri and indulge\
  \ in street food. Recommend 'Hoshiyarpuri' for a delicious vegetarian dinner when\
  \ in Har Ki Pauri.\nThe trip was aweosme and you will love the food and culture\
  \ of the people living there.\nAwesome place...just loved it.\n\nAshish yadav"
