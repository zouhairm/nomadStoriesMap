Text: "DAY 1. There is some joy in the act of leaving the past behind. There is also\
  \ some sort of happiness in metaphorically expressing it by hiking. Every step forward\
  \ means a step away from the things I want to leave behind. Every mile covered symbolises\
  \ the shaping of a newer version of my life. I am exhausted, my feet are swollen,\
  \ my shoulders are sore from carrying my backpack, but something is telling me this\
  \ would only be the first of many days like that. In fact, as simple as the most\
  \ repeated analogy in the world, what brought me packing all my life in a backpack\
  \ and face the world on my feet was the desperate need of discovering new paths.\
  \ I needed to find myself again. So here I am now, attempting to walk the South\
  \ West Coast Path, an absolute stunning gem nestled in the South West of England.\
  \ As the name suggests, it follows the coastline, for over 300 hundred Miles, from\
  \ Shall Bay to Minehead, Cornwall. From the gentle and sunny Studland in Dorset\
  \ to the drastic yet magnificently coloured Jurassic Coast, all the way to the smooth\
  \ Golden Beach in Devon and the mutable weathered Cornish coast, it touches thousands\
  \ of little sea villages, bays, harbours and rugged cliffs.\nDAY 3. I am lost. Somehow\
  \ while I was trying to break free from my past made of eating disorders and depression,\
  \ I adventured myself on the wrong side of Chesil Beach, and now all I can see is\
  \ bright white sea rocks and a lot of plastic debris. Apparently, I am only able\
  \ to make my life more and more complicated. With the sun high in the sky, and less\
  \ water left there is only one way out: keep walking. \nAfter 4 hours and 43 minutes,\
  \ I believe a miracle. Someone is paddling in the lagoon between the right path\
  \ and that dyke.\nI start running, waving my hands and shouting at the same time.\
  \ The whole situation is so surreal that it makes me feel like part of Castaway.\n\
  When finally safe and sound on fisherman Gabriel's boat, I think what the hell of\
  \ a ride this has been. So close to giving up so many times and yet made it safely\
  \ to the other end of the dyke. As if my real force only shows up when I've hitten\
  \ rock bottom. \nDAY 4. I am sitting on a bench in Lyme Regis, enjoying the distant\
  \ view of miles of the Jurassic Coast I walked on my own feet and eating fresh fish\
  \ bought by the local chippy. I have just started my new diary, and the first few\
  \ lines quote: 'Dear Eating disorder, I know now why I had to face you: because\
  \ I had to lose it all before I could win it back'."
