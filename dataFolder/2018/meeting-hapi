Text: "Reaching the final stretch of my first adventure, I was desperate to stave\
  \ off disappointment with the country. Though periodically breathtaking, Egypt,\
  \ by and large, was quite foreboding. Military checkpoints, blinding sandstorms\
  \ and tourist zones saturated by beggars, con-artists and pungent manure, alongside\
  \ the expected throng of sightseers. I was joined by six others, confined to a padded,\
  \ makeshift platform laid across the open deck of a modest felucca, adorned in a\
  \ stained, floral bedsheet of sorts. No separation, no privacy. It seemed even more\
  \ ridiculous when introduced to the captain and his first mate, two men who spoke,\
  \ collectively, two or three words of English. Their clothes were tattered and soiled.\
  \ Three days, I thought. We departed Aswan in the late afternoon. With the help\
  \ of some smuggled liquid courage, the first evening was largely spent laughing\
  \ at anecdotes and sharing photos. Our captain and first mate would always laugh\
  \ when we laughed, sing when we sang. A single candle lit the interior when dinner\
  \ was served, a combination of eish baladi, mixed lentils, beans and chicken soup.\
  \ It was during these long stretches of comfortable silence that I finally marveled\
  \ at Egypt\u2019s natural allure, silence being a commodity in any Mediterranean\
  \ country. The silhouetted banks of the river danced in front of an azure twilight.\
  \ The distant glow of bonafide Nile cruises twinkled on the river\u2019s horizon.\
  \ The captain, Abdo, joined me on the bow and handed me a beer. Naturally, we couldn\u2019\
  t use words, but they were hardly necessary. The scenery would suffice. Abdo reached\
  \ into a pocket and withdrew a picture of his children. Two sons and a daughter.\
  \ I pulled out my wallet and showed him a picture of my family.\n\u201CPretty\u201D\
  , he smiled. \u201CHave?\u201D\nI handed it to him and he pocketed it. None of us\
  \ spoke much after the first night, even when Abdo and his first mate docked and\
  \ disappeared for three hours at one point. We were hypnotized by the Nile. Its\
  \ ambience. The sting of the sun, the lullaby of its water, the vigor of its air,\
  \ and the busy contentedness of its people. At the end, a truck waited atop the\
  \ bank to drive us the rest of the way to Luxor. Abdo stopped me and pulled out\
  \ the picture of my family. \u201CThank,\u201D he said, embracing me. When I travel,\
  \ I always think first of Abdo, clutching a portrait of my anonymous family to his\
  \ chest. I imagine he still has it today, nine years later, and that it means as\
  \ much to him as his felucca still means to me."
