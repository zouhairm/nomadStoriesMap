Text: "The orange glow of morning meant the once looming atmosphere of Northern Thailand\u2019\
  s jungle was now cast in an inviting warmth. Sweet grass mixed with humidity fills\
  \ the air, and my boots scuff dirt as our group marches towards the towering wall\
  \ of green. An elephant trumpets behind me. Footfalls land rhythmically. A mahout\
  \ laughs and then yawns. \n\nExcitement electrifies the air as we grow distant from\
  \ Lampang\u2019s Thai Elephant Conservation Centre. An elephant scoffs beside me.\
  \ His name is Satit, and he is my assigned elephant. His mahout, Mister Sak, watches\
  \ me closely. He isn\u2019t hostile, just\u2026 wary. The Conservation Centre sees\
  \ many volunteer groups pass through, and I am finding it hard to impress the little\
  \ man, who walks with his back straight and face forward. \n\nWe enter a clearing\
  \ and we grapple aboard the elephants, with the help of the mahouts and laughter.\
  \ It is a surreal feeling being aboard a creature so gentle and powerful. A mahout\
  \ crouches lightly on the rump of the elephant before me, his feet bare as he lazily\
  \ scratches the cow\u2019s thick skin. I do the same on Satit. He shakes his head\
  \ to deter the flies, his ears hitting my thighs that hang behind his neck. I laugh\
  \ and hear Mister Sak yell \"Bai!\" behind me. When I look back at him, there is\
  \ a gleam in his eye. \n\nWe arrive at a campsite. Mister Sak teaches me how to\
  \ chop wood with a machete, and laughs when I fall down an incline into the underbrush.\
  \ When he notices I\u2019m struggling to roll pork into sticky rice during dinner,\
  \ he rolls rice for me. When I bow in thanks, he rolls my rice for the remainder\
  \ of the night. I also discover he is the cheekiest of the eight mahouts \u2013\
  \ he loves to touch people\u2019s shoulders before running away and pretending it\
  \ wasn\u2019t him. I sleep peacefully under the clusters of stars that night.  \n\
  \nThe next morning, I am presented with a gift \u2013 Mister Sak offers me a green\
  \ tube that resembles a cup. I raise it to get a better look. I get a strong whiff\
  \ of bamboo and see a carving of an elephant sketched into it. In broken English,\
  \ he says \u201CFor you. Satit, here\u201D, pointing at the sketch. My breath catches\
  \ and I grip the cup with more sincerity, afraid it is going to disappear. When\
  \ I meet Mister Sak\u2019s gaze, I feel trusted. I had not spoken a word to him,\
  \ but I feel I have earned his respect. And he has earnt mine. The journey back\
  \ to the sanctuary is filled with both joy and sadness, and I hold close the adventure\
  \ and lessons Mister Sak \u2013 a Thai stranger \u2013 taught me."
