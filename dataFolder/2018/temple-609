Text: "Nestling into a crumbling corner of the red-brick roof, I looked around for\
  \ what felt like the first time in hours. The once oppressive sun started to soften,\
  \ lighting up the backdrop of over two thousand temples with orange and violet streaks.\
  \ Careful not to miss a thing, I turned quickly to the concerned gatekeeper, smiled,\
  \ and took up his offer of a cup of tea.\n\nBagan at sunset. Ask any of the 3 million\
  \ visitors to Myanmar each year what is at the top of their checklist and you're\
  \ sure to get the same answer. But whilst the tour buses flock to the Shwesandaw\
  \ Pagoda, I wanted to prove that this advice was best left in the guidebook and\
  \ follow a local shopkeeper\u2019s eager recommendation of a secret sunset spot.\n\
  \nStarting in the backpacker centre of Nyaung-U, I took one swift look in the wonky\
  \ wing-mirror of my hastily-hired electric bike and left the tourist routes in my\
  \ wake. It didn't take long for the tarmac roads to become dirt paths; for the dirt\
  \ paths to become goat tracks, and for goat tracks to disappear altogether into\
  \ a red mist of sand. Unperturbed, I slithered tentatively on, splitting my attention\
  \ between the towering temples rising up on the horizon and the thick, coarse tree\
  \ roots that threatened to unseat me at any moment. \n\nAfter one long hour in the\
  \ blistering mid-afternoon heat, my pastel pink t-shirt already soaked in cool sweat,\
  \ I reached a small kiosk where I refuelled with an obligatory Coca-Cola. But with\
  \ the minutes ticking away, I had to put both my bike and my nerves to the limit\
  \ if I was to make it to my destination in time. Exploding across the plains, I\
  \ took sticks and stones in my stride, grinding them between my wheels and spitting\
  \ them back out at jutting angles. As the speedometer continued to creep up, I revelled\
  \ in my self-made wind tunnel until I was unable to ignore the spluttering and guttering\
  \ no more.\n\nI had a flat tyre. \n\nThe romance of a paper map, peppered with dark\
  \ squiggles from the shopkeeper, rapidly lost both its attraction and function when\
  \ I found myself hopelessly dragging the stubborn bike behind me. As I eventually\
  \ panted up to a small, secluded temple on the outer edge of the Archaeology Zone,\
  \ I realised I had just half an hour to go before sunset.\n\nWith a renewed sense\
  \ of energy, I followed a nimble gatekeeper up a dark, narrow, spiral staircase\
  \ and stepped out onto the empty rooftop. The battered and broken bike lay helplessly\
  \ next to a golden sign stating \u201CTemple 609\u201D \u2013 just what I had been\
  \ looking for."
