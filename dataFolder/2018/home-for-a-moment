Text: "I attribute the source of my wanderlust to the bedtime stories my mother would\
  \ tell from as early on as I can remember. Nightly, she spoke of a far away, fantasyland\
  \ and I'd fancy myself on a golden beach, salty brackish ocean breeze in my hair,\
  \ and the sweet taste of sa ke (breadfruit) on my lips. A reprieve, particularly\
  \ during our bleak white and bone-chilling Albertan winter; which typically lasted\
  \ at least seven months at a time.\n\nAt five-years-old, despite my breadfruit access\
  \ limited to tin cans and the only warmth I felt as the result of being bundled\
  \ up in blankets, next to a space heater, in our one bedroom apartment in Chinatown,\
  \ I fiercely clung to the idea that soon I'd be sailing on Mekong river and dancing\
  \ in the streets under glowing lanterns until the sun came up. Like mom did when\
  \ she was my age.\n\nOvertime reality slowly dawned on me why we lived in Calgary\
  \ and how travel to Vietnam was unlikely for me as the daughter of refugees or \"\
  Boat People.\" Mom recalls being called this when she first arrived in Canada by\
  \ strangers and immigrants alike.\n\nAs I grew, the charming stories of a middle-class\
  \ Vietnamese childhood were replaced with tales of heartbreak following the fall\
  \ of Saigon in 1975. \"We can never go back,\" she once told me nonchalantly at\
  \ age-16. I don't remember her reasons (something about Communists, maybe?) but\
  \ it didn't stop me from still dreaming of Vietnam...and continuing to discreetly\
  \ add to my pitiful travel fund.\n\nWe didn't talk about Vietnam again until 2015\
  \ when a health scare rocked me to my core and I made a decision that pushed me\
  \ to the edge. At 26-years-old I was not ready to lose my mom and unwilling to accept\
  \ that I'd never make a pilgrimage to my ancestral homeland. I swore we'd find a\
  \ way to Vietnam. \n\nAlmost a year later, my resilient mother and I were east-ward\
  \ bound! Over two weeks we made our way from Ho Chi Minh City and to H\u1ED9i An\u2013\
  I tasted fruits I didn't even know existed, paddled down the Delta in a canoe and\
  \ toured the house where my family lived for three generations until the civil war\
  \ broke. The entire trip was an out of body experience. Physically my hair fought\
  \ the heavy humidity and my senses were in overdrive from the constant beeping of\
  \ horns combined with a language I barely understood\u2013yet, I felt a strange\
  \ sense of belonging and acceptance.\n\nThe experience wasn't the adventure I had\
  \ anticipated but the joy of seeing things through mom's eyes was priceless. She\
  \ was home. If only for a moment."
