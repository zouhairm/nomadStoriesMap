Text: "\u201CMagnus, you don\u2019t think they could come with us?\u201D a spry voice\
  \ reasoned. It came from Gro, a pixy-like character, who seemed to be the little\
  \ sister of the floor.  Magnus stood to take his dish back to the sink. \u201CI\
  \ guess we would have space,\u201D he said without in almost a rhetorical manner.\
  \ \" Just make sure you pack your skis.\u201D \n\nThe landscape was nothing but\
  \ heavy pine trees and blinding snow. We maneuvered our way into the forest one-step\
  \ and glide and fall at a time. As unskilled skiers, Shelby and I used our upper\
  \ body pull to survive. \u201CCait, can you believe we are doing this? We are real\
  \ Norwegians!\u201D Shelby cheered. \n\nOn these narrow trails, the pine trees were\
  \ reaching out above us, creating a canopy from the snow. We would swirl around\
  \ turns and come out with a fresh mountainside view of the valley below. It was\
  \ untouched beauty, and we were simply taking a step or glide forward to see more.\
  \ We had come across a small cabin; a commercial spot for skiers in the middle of\
  \ the mountain. Inside, there were blonde Norwegians of every size; children and\
  \ those with a few decades of life. It felt like a Helly Hansen show room, with\
  \ ski gear and coats and hats of the iconic Norwegian outdoor brand. Our friends\
  \ had went ahead of us and just like experts picked out their supplies and sat on\
  \ a wooden bench in what looked like a mess hall. Although a little crammed, the\
  \ fireplace in the corner was filling the room with a welcoming heat. \n\nGro smiled\
  \ and offered us some Kvikk Lunsj. This Norwegian Chocolate came in a yellow envelope\
  \ and was massive in its bar size. \u201CAfter skiing, we always have a solo and\
  \ chocolate.\u201D Solo was their choice of orange soda. Shelby and I nodded and\
  \ quickly tasted the chocolatey lesson. We had made the first leg of the trip, and\
  \ our companions had not seemed too bothered by their foreign companions and our\
  \ novice skill sets. Those hours had taught us so much about the country we were\
  \ now living in and the people that ran it, or skied it, rather. \n\n\u201CCait.\u201D\
  \ I turned and saw Magnus standing behind me. He handed me and Shelby a solo, in\
  \ a celebratory exchange, he raised his drink. \u201CNow you are official Vikings.\
  \ Join us again anytime you like.\u201D"
