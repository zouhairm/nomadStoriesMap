Text: "Halifax, Canada is an amazing place, especially for a small-town farm girl\
  \ from Saskatchewan. Instead of miles of golden and yellow grains, there is miles\
  \ of deep and beautiful ocean blues.\nAfter getting my journalism degree, I spent\
  \ a year as a freelance journalist because I was not ready to leave those miles\
  \ of blue and the city's touchable history.\nHowever, living in Halifax is difficult\
  \ since a poor economy, high cost of living, and aging working population create\
  \ their own problems while five universities mean a large pool of people trying\
  \ to find work.\nSome professional fields just don't have the paid capacity for\
  \ the grads now trying to find jobs. Creating your own opportunities is becoming\
  \ a better alternative. This is what an amazing dance company gave to their dancers;\
  \ a home for their art.\nIn Halifax, there is not as strong a dance community as\
  \ there is in other parts of the country.\nOther cities across Canada have world\
  \ premiere dance companies, like The Royal Winnipeg Ballet and the National Ballet\
  \ of Canada in Toronto, and award winning schools to train Canadian based dancers.\n\
  Mocean Dance Company's Emerge program in Halifax chose four Nova Scotia dancers\
  \ for a five week paid internship to collectively choreograph a piece of work. For\
  \ four weeks, they got to contribute to the Halifax dance scene and live in their\
  \ home province at a time where all of them were living in different places across\
  \ Canada.\nSpeaking with them for an article I wrote for Halifax Media Co-op, they\
  \ were beyond grateful for this opportunity to work in Halifax as dancers.\n\u201C\
  When you get to grade 10, 11, 12, than you hit a roof as far as your training goes,\u201D\
  \ said dancer Sarah Hopkin in the article, who commuted from Toronto to dance in\
  \ Halifax. \u201CThere isn't any sort of training facility here that can bridge\
  \ the gap between pre-professional and professional [training]. That tends to be\
  \ when everyone leaves.\u201D\nThe problem in Halifax, and all the women were aware\
  \ of this, is that they want to be a part of a scene that needs professional dancers.\
  \ \nBut professional dancers need jobs.\nThis was there opportunity and they relished\
  \ the fact that, even for a short time, this was their moment to create art in Halifax.\n\
  According to Hopkin in the Halifax Media Co-op article, Halifax's small pond held\
  \ its own benefits; a better place to find or make dance opportunities than trying\
  \ to navigate the Toronto ocean. Building networks and making connections is much\
  \ easier in a smaller bowl."
