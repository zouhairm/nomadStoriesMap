Text: "A good night\u2019s sleep at this elevation is challenging. The air is thin,\
  \ and my head throbs slowly but forcefully. I sip some water from a nearby bottle.\
  \ Unknowingly, the contents had frozen and a sharp shard of ice navigates past my\
  \ lips, striking the back of my throat. Amid the searing pain and the howling wind\
  \ outside of the thin, wooden walls of this isolated mountain teahouse, I decide\
  \ to get up.\n \nI lost sight of Mount Everest a few days ago, but if I overcome\
  \ the Cho La Pass today, I will be within reach of the famous peak. I pack my cumbersome\
  \ bag, take in a bowl of pungent garlic soup - a natural panacea for altitude sickness\
  \ - and begin the uphill trek with my guide, Mingmar.\n \nTwo hours pass as I trudge\
  \ through the Moon-like surface of light-grey rock and sand in the valley, scrambling\
  \ up to a prominent plateau to face a vast boulder field, the final obstacle before\
  \ the Pass.\n \nThe boulders stand two-metres high, and close together. Jump, land\
  \ and balance. Again, and again. I stare at my feet and the rock in front of me,\
  \ keeping mind of Mingmar\u2019s bright orange coat in my periphery. \n\nI\u2019\
  m tiring. Oxygen is at around ten percent, and even slight motions cause shortness\
  \ of breath. My plyometric movement has me hunched over, but it is difficult to\
  \ stop and feel steady on the rounded boulders. I must continue my jumping rhythm.\n\
  \nThen disaster. My dusty boot fails to grip the angle of the boulder beneath me.\
  \ My right leg extends and my left leg tucks under my hips, bracing for impact.\
  \ My right heel strikes the earth first. My ankle buckles, and a sharp pain shoots\
  \ up my leg, darting past my shin and knee and I forget where it stops because my\
  \ attention arrows back to the excruciating pain at the point of impact.\n \nMingmar\
  \ reads my grimace, but his basic English prevents full understanding of my agony.\
  \ He rummages through his bag and locates a bandage, alleviating the pain enough\
  \ so that I can place my weight on two feet again. \n\n\u201CHere Pass. Now, hard\
  \ bit\u201D Mingmar chuckles. I peel my eyes away from my feet, and stare up at\
  \ the intimidating rock face in front of us. \n\nBattling fatigue and injury, I\
  \ start to lose belief that I can tackle the Pass. I could turn back. I could get\
  \ back to a hotel in a few days, take a warm shower and sleep. But that is not why\
  \ I am here, and as with every day so far, I summon willpower that I did not know\
  \ existed and put one foot in front of the other. Each step taking me closer to\
  \ Everest. Towards the ceiling of the world."
