Text: "Baby boomers are on the move! Throughout my life, travel to new places has\
  \ sustained my life spirit.  With or without family, known and new destinations,\
  \ world heritage sites or a Toyota City middle school, new people and experiences\
  \ renewed me.  This was my eighteenth year teaching middle schoolers and I needed\
  \ refreshing.  AdventureLife made an offer:   Manchu Picchu in time for the Festival\
  \ of the Sun were beginning of a week of parades, music, dancing, with tens of thousand\
  \ of Quechua people. Cusco is a beautiful, old city invaded by Spaniards during\
  \ the 16th century.  Guide Miguel detailed the Inca Empire, including the Quechua.\
  \ The Cathedral Basilica of our Lady of the Assumption includes a grand display\
  \ of Inca monarchs, artifacts, clothing, jewelry and architectural models. A rehearsal\
  \ for the upcoming reenactment, including llama \u2018sacrefice,\u2019 of the annual\
  \ solstice rights was taking place near the ruins of Qurikancha, one of the richest\
  \ Incan temples. A circuitous route to the Sacred Valley included aquaducts, canals\
  \ and waterfalls of Tambomacha and avoided holiday traffic.  We walked the Pisac\
  \ ruins and circular experimental agriculture terraces near Maras.   A local family\
  \ opened their relic and guinea pig filled home, provided a demonstration of llama\
  \ shearing, wool dying, spinning, weaving These kind people taught me to bundle\
  \ a baby, carry bulky items and wrap myself in my treasured purchase. Arriving in\
  \ Urubamba we walked the cobblestoned streets before a sumptuous meal of alpaca\
  \ Lomo Saltado, ceviche and quinoa soup before an early night. dfMorning brought\
  \ a new twist.\nA rock slide on the tracks had closed down the railway.  Travelers\
  \ were stranded at the monument and below.  Magic Miguel informed our little group\
  \ of travelers (6) to stay close. The weather was beautiful, the air crisp, and\
  \ I was willing to believe Miguel would make miracles happen.  He did just before\
  \ supper, hustling us all to the station to board the first train up the pass to\
  \ Agua Calientes. El MaPi Inn had held dinner for late arrivals, made the anxious\
  \ day worthwhile.  We would be in Manchu Picchu for the winter equinox!   At 4:30\
  \ AM we were on the first shuttle bus then climbing to the sacred Temple of the\
  \ Sun to watch as the Torreon reflected the magnificent rising sun. A most spiritual\
  \ moment!   Miguel led us throughout the monument providing insight to the history\
  \ I had taught so many years.  My restorative Manchu Picchu experience ended in\
  \ natural hot springs."
