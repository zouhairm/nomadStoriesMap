Text: "History repeats itself\u2026I burdened my backpack again and headed to Ollantaytambo\
  \ to discover a small town that hid something special.\nThere, I met Julieta, a\
  \ little girl just over 5 years old who lost her mother, and lived in a village\
  \ called Bandolista. Curiously, she asked me what I was doing in these lands. I\
  \ replied that I wanted to discover the world, leaving behind any trace of materialism.\
  \ So, I undertook an adventure to travel and work till something drew me back home.\
  \ \u201CWell, you are like day and night, it must be nice to travel, but I have\
  \ to stay here to take care of my animals, as this is my livelihood, and the other\
  \ day, 6 chickens died on me.\u201D She said.\nHer response stumped me momentarily.\
  \ It\xB4s one of those moments where you realize that personal growth depends on\
  \ what your life holds for you. This beautiful girl was far more aware of things\
  \ I rarely gave importance to.\nAfter dinner, I ended up having drinks at a local\
  \ bar, with two women in their 60s, who worked in the market. They explained their\
  \ stories using Spanish and Quechua, to the gringo in the bar, mixed between strong\
  \ drinks and tears of despair.\nSeemingly, the alcohol helped as a balm to soothe\
  \ wounds and release everything within. The next day, I went to the market to meet\
  \ them, where I was welcomed by hidden smiles and relieved eyes yet not revealing\
  \ too much to accommodate the reality around them.\nI realized that in a few hours,\
  \ I met women of two generations, whom apart from age, did not differ much. Their\
  \ traditions were imprinted on them, and despite the harsh situations, they were\
  \ faithful to everything that Pachamama offered them.\nI left that place questioning\
  \ many things and made my way to Moray in Maras, an air conditioning laboratory\
  \ created by the ancient Incas, where old \u201Ccolcas\u201D (barns) preserved food\
  \ in a microclimate designed like an amphitheater which emulated the shape of the\
  \ very mountain it was built on; again the respect to Pachamama handed through the\
  \ generations.\nThe circle closed as soon as my questions were answered; love, pain,\
  \ feelings, the wholeness of each of those women revolves around what earth offers\
  \ them. Julieta had lost her mother to earth, the very same that fed her animals,\
  \ the earth that was cultivated so that those old teary-eyed women could go the\
  \ market at 5am, that also saw day and night pass, and the very same earth that\
  \ offered the traveler to walk on or work on.\nAn earth that offers everything,\
  \ but also takes away at its own will."
