Text: "The year is 2018. The world is divided. \nIn many ways, you could say it was\
  \ inevitable that we would get here as a society. \nPeople hurt. People don\u2019\
  t learn from their own past mistakes. People don\u2019t learn from their parents\
  \ mistakes. \nTo many, there is no hope.\nTo me, however, there is endless possibility.\n\
  This is the year I decide to do myself a favor and live only for myself. I know\
  \ this sounds selfish and that\u2019s because it is selfish. \nI have a small group\
  \ of people I would do anything for. This doesn\u2019t change that and I don\u2019\
  t think I could stop caring for them if I wanted to.\nNo, this doesn\u2019t mean\
  \ I say \u201Cf*** you\u201D to everyone in my life and disappear, or that I\u2019\
  m so wrapped up in my own world that I don\u2019t notice that someone else is reaching\
  \ out to me.  \nThis simply means that I do the things I want, I say the things\
  \ I want, I eat the things I want, I buy the things I want, etc... \nI am now aware\
  \ that I control how my life ends up. \nIf I want to roll around in money, I am\
  \ going to work my ass off and make some damn money.\nIf I want to adopt an enormous\
  \ and expensive dog that would bring some happiness to my life, I\u2019m going to\
  \ do that.\nIf I want to travel to Germany and see the Neushwanstein castle, I\u2019\
  m going to book my flight and hotel.\nAll my life I have missed out on things I\
  \ have always wanted to do or own for such ridiculous reasons. \nFor one, I have\
  \ extremely wise people in my life who usually give me advice that makes me question\
  \ my impulse decisions and second guess the things I want to do. \nSecondly, I don\u2019\
  t always have someone to make those impulse decisions with. Although I consider\
  \ myself an independent person for the most part, I realized recently that if no\
  \ one wants to do the road trip or book the flight with me, I usually bail as well.\
  \ Not because I don\u2019t want to do it but because I\u2019m secretly afraid to\
  \ do big things on my own.\nOnce I realized that I can\u2019t wait for others to\
  \ be on the same page as me, I actually started to live my life. \nI started to\
  \ really get to know myself. I started to trust myself. I started to listen to myself.\
  \ \nNow when I get council from the people I respect in my life, I try to take the\
  \ wisdom from what they\u2019re saying but I balance it out with my own thoughts\
  \ on the matter. \nBecause the truth is, at the end of the day I am the one who\
  \ has to deal with my choices. Not my dad, not my brother, not my pastor, not my\
  \ fitness coach. They all have made choices to get them where THEY want to be. \n\
  Mine are for myself."
