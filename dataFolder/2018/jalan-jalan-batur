Text: "Indonesia was another planet to me, when I presented it at school. As kid from\
  \ a 500 people village in the Italy of the \u201890s, where immigration had just\
  \  started and everything was Catholic, I could not have imagined to get there one\
  \ day. \nI arrived in Bali in 2014. My boyfriend and I drove to Lovina, looking\
  \ forward to leave the Kuta\u2019s touristic buzz: the best experiences always happen\
  \ on the less-beaten tracks. And the magic started!\nLovina was quiet. Flat beach,\
  \ few warungs and a lovely room on the 1st floor of a Balinese house whose small\
  \ pool had red fishes and lotus flowers. \nAt sunset, I wandered on the beach, captured\
  \ by the purple colors which were immersing everything...the air, the sand, the\
  \ hills, the walls. The breeze was cradling the palm leaves, the waves caressing\
  \ the shore were the only sound. The atmosphere smelled absolute freedom. Perfect.\
  \ \nI was collecting shells, my boyfriend was sleeping in the back. \nWhile walking,\
  \ I started seeing a shadow behind me, but I continued on my way. After some time\
  \ that shadow was still following me. I got worried and turned back. With my big\
  \ astonishment, there was a local young woman with a 3 year old boy. In a tone between\
  \ exclamation and question she said \u201Cpicture\u201D (probably out of her few\
  \ English words); I nodded and I was going to take a photo of the two...I needed\
  \ a while to understand she wanted a picture with me! When I realized that, we started\
  \ posing. After few seconds I was completely surrounded by her girlfriends and their\
  \ children. They were either wearing the hijab or not, and Hollywood-star sunglasses!\
  \ All the women wanted to have a photo with me, they were very happy and continued\
  \ to say \u201Cbeautiful, beautiful!\u201D, even if I was claiming \u201CYOU are\
  \ beautiful\u201D. At some point, my boyfriend was also taking pictures of this\
  \ amusing and peculiar situation. Then they said \u201Cthank you, thank you\u201D\
  \ and rushed away cheering. I needed some time to process the dynamic of this charming\
  \ event.\nThe journey gifted us with few connections, as the sarong seller in Senggigi\
  \ revealing his dream: saving enough money to get on the government\u2019s list\
  \ for the pilgrimage to La Mecca.\nI was deeply impressed by their openness to strangers.\
  \ Seldom we are used to associate charm and beauty towards what is foreign, instead\
  \ of threat. \nIf the whole humanity would endorse their national slogan Bhinneka\
  \ Tunggal Ika (Unity in Diversity), the world would be a truly amazing place. It\
  \ takes so little to overcome differences."
