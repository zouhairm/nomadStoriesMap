Text: "Dear Diary,\n       On my third day in my English program, the only thing I\
  \ can write today is, God, please save me! I have too much homework. Thank you,\
  \ Brian!\nDear Diary,\n       Today was my tenth day in my English program. I know,\
  \ I jumped from the third to the tenth day. That is because I still have too much\
  \ homework to do. I am writing today because something different happened to me.\
  \ Here it goes. Today, I was going to my Grammar class and I saw a guy on his knees\
  \ and with his head facing the ground. I thought that he was not feeling okay, so\
  \ I went to check if he needed some help. When I got closer to him, I could hear\
  \ that he was speaking in his mother language. I thought, \u201CWhy in the world\
  \ is he asking for help in his mother language? That is insane!\u201D so I asked,\
  \ \u201CAre you okay?\u201D He said \u201Cyeah! I am just praying\u201D. I said,\
  \ \u201COh sorry\u201D. He said that it was fine and introduced himself.  His name\
  \ is Saleh. He explained to me that Muslims should pray almost five times a day.\
  \ In addition, they should pray wherever they are. I watched a lot bad things about\
  \ Muslims on media, but this guy was so nice and friendly. He was nothing like;\
  \ I imagined that a Muslim man would look like. Saleh noticed my reaction and my\
  \ predictable facial expressions! I said that I was a little bit afraid of him because\
  \ I watched on TV so many bad things about Muslims. That being said, he just looked\
  \ at me, as it was not the first time that he was hearing it. Then, he asked. \u201C\
  Are you Christian?\u201D I said yes. Then, Saleh said that he was a little bit afraid\
  \ of me too. Because he also watched on TV so many bad things about Christians.\
  \ I said that what he said was ridiculous because my religion is based on love.\
  \ Then Saleh smiled and said my religion too. I felt stupid, and I got what he was\
  \ trying to show me. I got to the conclusion that his religion is also based on\
  \ love. This cultural understanding was only possible because of how we communicated.\
  \ I realized that many misunderstandings are caused because people do not know how\
  \ to communicate. Then, I cried. I mean, I cried like a baby. As a Black person,\
  \ I know how prejudice hurts. My intolerance created by my ignorance about his religion\
  \ was hurting him too. This moment definitely changed me. I realized that understand\
  \ each other is essential to all of us to live and develop as human beings and our\
  \ multilingual ability had the main role in achieving this.\n       Okay dear diary,\
  \ I think that is it for today."
