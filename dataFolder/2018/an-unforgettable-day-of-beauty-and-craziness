Text: "Norway is definitely my love at first sight. Every time I go off the plane,\
  \ breathe that pure air, see that magnificent scenery, I feel myself so alive. And\
  \ every time a new adventure happens. But once it nearly cost me my life.\nI heard\
  \ so much about Trolltunga, a famous cliff in the mountains with a breathtaking\
  \ view, so on one of my trips I convinced my friend to go there. It was in the middle\
  \ of July and we thought that we didn\u2019t need any equipment, the road itself\
  \ seemed not to be too hard. The plan was simple. Get up before dawn, hitchhike\
  \ to the starting point, climb up and come down till darkness, and then go back\
  \ home. Simple and, as we later understand, insane. Actually, I could write a whole\
  \ book about that day and night, but now I am trying to be brief. \nThe fun starts\
  \ from the beginning. We read that there was a funicular, but when we came, it was\
  \ already closed for good. So what we did? Found another way..? Ha-ha! We climbed\
  \ the funicular stairs. It was dangerous, because a lot of the steps were ruined,\
  \ and the height made us dizzy. But the main problem appeared after we did that.\
  \ It was July and nevertheless it was snow all around. Couple of times we sank into\
  \ it, our legs were soaked to the bone, there were some ups and downs on our way\
  \ up, but we strongly decided not to turn back. We were tired as hell but happy\
  \ and proud when we finally got to the cliff. We took photos, we laughed and had\
  \ the best time there. And yes, the view blew our minds. Of course, we tried to\
  \ keep an eye on time, but we were so naive to think that we could have done it\
  \ in a short time, and we weren't ready to the road fully covered with snow. So\
  \ when we went back, it was too late, and in half an hour it got so dark you can't\
  \ see your hand in front of your face. And then above all the heavy rain began.\
  \ \nSo imagine. Your are in the middle of nowhere during the darkest night without\
  \ any mobile connection, there is no people, you climb down the slippery rough road\
  \ through wind and rain, and one step in wrong direction and you could fall into\
  \ the abyss, amd moreover you barely know the way back, because you came here from\
  \ funicular not from the right path.\nThankfully I had some knowledge of survival\
  \ and with the phone light step by step kept each other from falling we got down\
  \ to an empty parking lot, where the another story began. But the only thing that\
  \ really matters is that we were alive and we did it. \nAnd in fact looking back\
  \ from a warm safe home it was great."
