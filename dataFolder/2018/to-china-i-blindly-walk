Text: "From factories and smog to mountains and rice paddy fields. Before I knew it,\
  \ I was in China, flying over Beijing through a heavy layer of yellowish smog bellowing\
  \ from the chimneys of hundreds of factories laying waste to plains hat surrounded\
  \ the Capital. I recall being tired, hungry and extremely thirsty, AirChina was\
  \ not a terrible airline, but the food was awful.\n\nI had to wait a while for my\
  \ connecting flight, I exchanged some money and felt completely out of my element.\
  \ For a while I sat and drank some water, I nibbled on some food while I stared\
  \ blankly at my laptop. Sitting on those hard-blue airport chairs is definitely\
  \ not the highlight of any journey of this magnitude, the place now seems so large\
  \ now in my memory; at that time I felt extremely overwhelmed. Nothing had sunk\
  \ in, I was totally lost in the vast expanse of timelessness. For a moment everything\
  \ stood still.\n\nI don\u2019t recall the flight from Beijing to Wenzhou, only my\
  \ encounter with the DOS and a local named John.\nFor some reason, I brought a lot\
  \ with me. I remember having to lug around several suitcases, a cabin bag and a\
  \ rucksack. The DOS and John helped me out, placing the heaving bags into the boot\
  \ of John\u2019s small car before we headed off into the darkness that had blanketed\
  \ China at something past 8 or 9 in the evening. I didn\u2019t manage to capture\
  \ much along this ride, just road and buildings, old rundown buildings that glowed\
  \ ghostly pale and eerily in the darkness. A haunting image to this very day.\n\n\
  There was some chit chatter that I mustered to engage in, but in all honesty I was\
  \ over exhausted, to the brink of collapsing and drifting into a very long sleep.\
  \ They gave me a temporary apartment while the teacher I was replacing remained\
  \ to finish his last two weeks.\n\nMy new apartment was awful. It smelt rank, as\
  \ if no one had cleaned it, ever. It felt grimy, slimy- with all the grease of China\
  \ smothering its walls. I remember being told that the previous owner had had a\
  \ cleaning lady to attend to the needs of the apartment. Despite using some very\
  \ strong chemicals, bleach and plenty of hot, scorching water, the rank stench never\
  \ truly faded away. It only seemed to lay dorm in my ignorance and would return\
  \ every time I was away for a little too long, greeting me like an old, unwanted\
  \ regret. A reminder best cast away, never to be revisited.\nThis was the last thing\
  \ I ever expected to have happened, to have moved to China and be expected to live\
  \ in the remnants of someone else\u2019s mess."
