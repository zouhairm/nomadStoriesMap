Text: "After a recent trip to South Africa I became hyper aware of the information\
  \ one reads or hears from half away across the world and how that can differ incredibly\
  \ to the truth of the situation. This connection did not occur to me fully until\
  \ after a status update from a friend came across my FaceBook newsfeed. The issue\
  \ concerns the apparent water shortage in the world especially pertaining to Cape\
  \ Town, South Africa. The trip itself happened because of an auto racing event that\
  \ I attended. This led to an encounter with locals, who had been racing at the track\
  \ for years, as we were watching the practice sessions together. I must state that\
  \ South Africans are some of the most friendly people I have met and are willing\
  \ to share their stories, even the ones filled with struggle and strife. We talked\
  \ over American politics, some of the recent shootings in the U.S. and of course,\
  \ the Cape Town water shortage. \n\nIn any country, state or city there are mass\
  \ amounts of convoluted information about such issues as politics and water shortages.\
  \ The hardest thing to do is find the Real Truth. My contradiction is the information\
  \ I heard from the locals in Cape Town versus the information that Americans are\
  \ receiving (specifically the FaceBook Status) and how to weed out what is real\
  \ and what is most likely gossip, assumption and just plain old bad facts. In the\
  \ end, the truth I waver towards is what the locals know. The locals, one a teenager\
  \ and the other a father, clearly weathered by his hard life in Cape Town, in my\
  \ mind, must be closer to the truth than what a Facebook Status states. \n\nThe\
  \ FaceBook user assumed that Cape Town will run out of water within a year and that\
  \ there is use of desalination plants converting sea water into drinking water.\
  \ The locals told me that there are no desalination plants, and if there are, they\
  \ are not being used; there is political strife between Johannesburg and Cape Town,\
  \ meaning that Johannesburg, which is chock full of water, will not share their\
  \ precious supply with Cape Town. It is very difficult to understand a place your\
  \ are not from and I never wish to make presumptions until I have seen for myself.\
  \ For a span of 24 hours, during my visit, the water supply to Cape Town was shut\
  \ off, apparently, \"due to pipeline maintenance\", according to the flyers posted\
  \ on my hotel door. Later, I find out that it is possible this shut-off was due\
  \ to the political strife. These are issues in which I would like to find the TRUTH."
