Text: "The tall peaks of the great Himalaya unfurled around me like historic scrolls,\
  \ and I didn\u2019t care one bit.\n\nThe Himachal Pradesh mountains loomed over\
  \ our little village like cloaked guardians, and to my horror I discovered I hated\
  \ it. The snow, the darkness, and the sheer, bloody remoteness.\n\nBecause it was\
  \ freezing. Inside and out.\n\nMy jeans were paper on my thighs; my thick woollen\
  \ scarf gossamer around my neck. \n\nIt didn\u2019t help that our group of travellers\
  \ - all shambolic rucksacks and dusty shoes - had arrived after two weeks of getting\
  \ used to the gasping, incessant, tourist clamour of India\u2019s Golden Triangle.\n\
  \nWe had only just acclimatised to Delhi, Agra and Jaipur - a mass of sweaty taxis\
  \ and beeping rickshaws - and here we were, plunged into a distinctly non-tourist\
  \ valley of monkeys and shadow.\n\nThe water in our house was stubbornly glacial,\
  \ making our daily \u201Cbucket showers\u201D feel like an ascetic ritual.\n\nI\
  \ was angry with myself for being unprepared, but also because I cared more about\
  \ the cold than I wanted to admit. Typical cosseted, spoiled Westerner.\n\nYet,\
  \ respite: the hot sun shone brightly - an egg yolk in the sky - for just two hours\
  \ a day, coinciding with the hours that I worked outside.\n\nHaving come to help\
  \ at a local school, every morning I would look forward to singing the \u201Cplayground\
  \ hello song\u201D, while simultaneously craning up towards the sky as if I could\
  \ store warmth in my skin like a magpie foraging for glitter.\n\nOne girl, Anushka,\
  \ was just four.\n\nMinute yet plump, with lovingly-brushed hair secured in two\
  \ pink grips, her almond milk-coffee cheeks were dimpled with joy, and her brown\
  \ eyes shone even as no sound escaped her tiny lips.\n\nEveryday, she would plop\
  \ into my lap and colour silently, picking up each new crayon with studious determination.\n\
  \nLike a lioness clutching its favourite cub, I loved her with a protective fierceness.\n\
  \nHer parents\u2019 house was a patchwork of unfinished white and terracotta bricks,\
  \ and each day after school, Anushka took my hand - and mine alone - in her clammy\
  \ grip, and walked us placidly to her mother\u2019s front door.\n\nOn my last day,\
  \ as the sun shone on our backs, the colourful remnants of a wedding littering the\
  \ streets, the tang of coriander like mist in the air, I felt Anushka\u2019s fat\
  \ little hand in mine, and realised.\n\nRealised that for all the freezing cold,\
  \ I would always remember that moment with roaring warmth; a  burning love for India\
  \ that all the mountain ice could never even begin to extinguish."
