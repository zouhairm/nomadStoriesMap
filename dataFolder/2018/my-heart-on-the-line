Text: "Between the time I lost that year and the life I wanted for me, there were\
  \ a million miles of distance. It was the time to all those formalities of adult\
  \ life. College, new city, grow up. Before I could breath again, the fear had taken\
  \ a part of me. Came to me the idea to travel as a chance to light up some spark\
  \ in my aching soul. Without expecting too much, I was open for whatever could happen.\
  \ \n\nI took a bus in Belo Horizonte to a small town called Brumadinho, where the\
  \ most special place is a contemporary art open air museum, called Inhotim. I was\
  \ an art enthusiastic, however, my approach was shy, constantly left needing more.\
  \ Inhotim is a different kind of museum. Visitors are invited to experience intrestings\
  \ conditions in this brazilian world of art, where part of the artistic experience\
  \ involves interaction with the artworks . A rich diversity of trees, plants and\
  \ flowers from all over Brazil, made me think I was in a tropical universe. Felt\
  \ myself in a game created by some brazilian divine aspiration, trying to learn\
  \ everything to get to the center, lost on my own perceptions. I was a tiny person\
  \ in a universe of giants proportions.\n\nThe fountain behind this is a important\
  \ paisagist called Burle Marx. At the end, I meet him in statue. He was not just\
  \ a man, he was half turtle. How wonderful a human being can be. The magnitude of\
  \ his work exceeds the barriers of language. Finally felt belonged somewhere, doing\
  \ the right thing at the right moment. Sad to leave, continued my trip.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve already been to Ouro Preto twice before but I still had doubts about the black\
  \ resistance. This city was known in the brazilian Age of Gold because of the rich\
  \ golden mines, where slaves were forced to work. When I was next to a church, Seu\
  \ Nepole\xE3o was explaning something to a family when I approached him. He is a\
  \ black man, a history  teacher and tour guide. He told me about the Ros\xE1rio\u2019\
  s Church and other important places. The brazilian history gets lost in so much\
  \ oppression until today. Walking in the streets I felt something different after\
  \ meeting him. It\u2019s important to look to the aches in the society,  to the\
  \ history don\u2019t get missed.\n\nAfter 10 days travelling I went home. Something\
  \ changed inside of me that summer. Learned to be on my own company, appreciated\
  \ art and got to known a lot of histories. Borned again after get off the plane,\
  \ never been the same. My heart had found strength, and I knew I could count on\
  \ this forever."
