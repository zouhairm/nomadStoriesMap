Text: "\u201CHey, what\u2019s going on?\u201D\n\nTim, my guide, is standing calmly\
  \ on my right. Minutes before, he was 30 feet and several people above me in the\
  \ rope team. I glance up. Crazy man climbs like a monkey. What did he ask me? Oh.\
  \ Well Tim, I\u2019m standing on the face of a mountain, 3,000 feet off the ground,\
  \ and feeling a bit uncomfortable. \u201CStanding\u201D isn\u2019t quite right.\
  \ The toes of my crampon-clad boots embed in the snow piled on the vertical wall\
  \ we\u2019re climbing. It\u2019s more like tip-toeing. I\u2019m tip-toeing up a\
  \ mountain. How did I get here?\n\nRight. I chose to do a mountaineering course\
  \ in Alaska.\n\nToday is another in a string of challenges. The daddy long legs\
  \ that crawled across my face the first night we bunked down at base camp was just\
  \ the beginning. No bathing. No toilets. Since I have to ask for the group trowel\
  \ \u2013 named Kevin \u2013for the more serious business, there\u2019s been no hope\
  \ of privacy concerning personal routines.\n\nYet, every day I\u2019ve hiked out\
  \ of camp with a 60 pound pack on my back. I learned how to rig and jug a rope,\
  \ climb with an ice axe, set up camp. I drank glacier water, ate wild salmonberries\
  \ on the trail, pulled myself out of a crevasse, and slept on an icefield. I even\
  \ survived 24 hours in a 3-person tent with five smelly women to wait out a blizzard\
  \ after my tent buckled.\n\nNow, I\u2019m the reason we\u2019ve all stopped.\n\n\
  \u201CTalk to me.\u201D\n\nOh, yeah. Tim. The quiet command brings me back. My feet\
  \ are tucked into the snow, heels hanging out over an abyss. My knees are pressed\
  \ against the white wall in front of me, arms extended in the awkward shape of a\
  \ \u2018W\u2019 as if I\u2019m trying to hold on. I can feel the cold of the mountain\
  \ on my face, like standing in front of an open freezer. My breathing is shallow,\
  \ fast. When did that happen? I\u2019m more anxious than I realized.\nI say the\
  \ first thing that comes to mind, voice shaking. \u201CI just want to be at the\
  \ top. Right now.\u201D Yep, I\u2019m freaking out.\nHe smiles, and in a soothing\
  \ voice says, \u201CWe\u2019re almost to the top. Hang in there.\u201D He skips\
  \ back to his place at the lead.\n\nHang in there? Hilarious, Tim.\n\nTen minutes\
  \ pass in a blur, and finally, we crawl onto the mountaintop. I disengage from the\
  \ team and stand alone, turning a full circle as my breathing slows. On top of the\
  \ world, the other peaks ringing the basin are no longer above us but at eye level,\
  \ glaciers spilling down. The sky a vibrant blue.\n\nHow could I ever be afraid\
  \ to try anything after this? I\u2019ll never know if the destination is worth the\
  \ journey unless I start climbing."
