Text: "Before 2014 I was finding lots of ways on how to go to world cup. As one of\
  \ my sport bucket list, I need to fulfill my dream.  Not all people were given the\
  \ opportunity to travel further like 18,099 km 2 day travel from Manila to Rio with\
  \ stop over in Taiwan and Amsterdam. The question if how far will you go? As a poor\
  \ guy, the decision that pushed me to the edge of travel started last 2007. Was\
  \ making impossible things possible, I mean its like winning a lottery if you push\
  \ yourself to the edge. Before, I wish I was the son of the Canadian Billionaire\
  \ Stroll. So he can finance my f1 Racing career but Im not. In order for me to to\
  \ get free racing, drive cool cars, race suit, travel, posh hotel and schooling.\
  \ \n\nI need to beat that half a million application more and to race to those 50\
  \ finalist to make another great travel sport schooling race in Italy f1 Circuits.\
  \ In 2016, I was riding together with my Balloon Belgian Pilot in Lubao Hot Air\
  \ Festival Philippines. We were talking together that I like flying so much.  He\
  \ asked my why not took flying school? He doesn't  know that it will cost me millions\
  \ of pesos and probably 20-30 years of work to finance that Pilot schooling. At\
  \ the back of my mind, It took me a lot of time to travel then sell my blog writing\
  \ output before given to opportunity to ride on his balloon.   \n\nSo I dare myself\
  \ - a year before the world cup glory. That I will make a lot of ways to be part\
  \ of it. So It did happen in Rio. I enjoy football and I played it wayback high\
  \ school. My brother is also a great footballer.  In Abu Dhabi paddock club, I saw\
  \ small guy with lots of bodyguards. Then those f1 champs were very glad to meet\
  \ him. I was amazed he was the great football legend from Argentina.   Back in Rio,\
  \ I saw Messi score a goal live and I heard cool chants from Argentina people. \
  \ In the street, it was a Rio Brazil Country but I saw a lot of cool Argentinian\
  \ people. I mean it was dominated by ole ola people during that great football time.\
  \ Then I realized that Pope Francis is from Argentina. I was kind of impression\
  \ that Argentina was great in sport culture and spirit to explore.\n\nThats rhe\
  \ reason why I joined this contest while browsing again different ways on how to\
  \ go to Argentina. I find Argentina a very cool place to explore. I want to attend\
  \ the 10 day all expense trip. As an accidental writer for the love of contest.\
  \ I knew I can explore more by means of writing and pushing my self to the limits\
  \ if my finance will not permits."
