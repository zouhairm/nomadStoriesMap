Text: "Ocean Encounters\nThis is heaven. Only occasional, loudly screeching seagulls\
  \ flying above, were separating me from the scorching sun. In distance, a family\
  \ with their children were writing something in the sand and laughing at waves steeling\
  \ their words. Far away, in turquoise waters, the pelicans were enjoying the gentle\
  \ sway in rhythm of waves. What is it with the pelicans that makes them look so\
  \ different from other birds? Almost, as if the time stopped. My mind was drifting\
  \ away from evolution to realization, that this place felt magical. Surely, very\
  \ soon, I was bound to find out why.  \nMy fourth time of going to Florida became\
  \ more of the habit. Just what I needed after miserable, rainy months spent in the\
  \ UK. I have never had any interests in busy attraction parks, and I tried my very\
  \ best to avoid these \u201Cplastic-fantastic\u201D places. The locals helped me\
  \ with sharing their secret locations and quite places, somewhere where you could\
  \ feel like you had just stepped back in time. And I think, I have suddenly found\
  \ it.\nThis beach, this sky, this bright blue water, it felt like it belonged to\
  \ me. Just us and the salty air. My skin was burning and I needed to cool down.\
  \ I got up from the grainy sand and stepped in to refreshing, azure ocean. I walked\
  \ further, the soothing waves wrapped around my body and my hands gently caressed\
  \ the surface. All of a sudden, my mind panicked. The dark shadow in water abruptly\
  \ crept up closer and closer. It couldn\u2019t be! Please don\u2019t let that be\
  \ a shark. I had no time to move. My legs turned into rocks embedded in sand. I\
  \ looked behind me. The beach was too far, people were too far. Should I shout?\
  \ Would anyone hear me? My head turned back to the dark, scary shadow now right\
  \ in front of me and my body froze.  This is it. I will be dragged into the deepest\
  \ blue. My life flashed in front of me. At that instant, a rough, hairy face with\
  \ nostrils popped up. This is the last thing I expected to see, a manatee. Its eyes\
  \ connected with mine and something very deep in our hearts moved. I could feel\
  \ all the tension disappearing. We both took a deep breath. My body was still. The\
  \ gentle giant pushed its head against my stomach as if it wanted to play. I wish\
  \ I could. We stayed like this for a short while, observing each other, and then\
  \ the dark mass started to move away from me. I still can\u2019t believe how such\
  \ a scary moment changed into the most incredible thing that had ever happened to\
  \ me. The moment, that will stay with me forever."
