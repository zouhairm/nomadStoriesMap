Text: "The tiny but magical town of Jalcomulco is located in Veracruz, about a five-hour\
  \ drive from Mexico City. This town beholds beautiful landscapes, friendly people,\
  \ good mezcal and plenty of outdoor activities for adrenaline junkies like me, including\
  \ rappel, zip-lining and river rafting. \nThe trip began with a flat tire, a foggy\
  \ highway, toll booths taken by locals asking for better salaries, and me driving\
  \ five strangers who had one clear thing in common, love for adventure. \nWhen we\
  \ arrived, the landscapes made any previous inconvenience worth it. A path made\
  \ of rocks guided us through flowers and trees into our camping area, next to a\
  \ tiki hut from which we could see the intense stream of La Antigua river. After\
  \ zip-lining across the river and tall trees, a rustic pool was the perfect way\
  \ to relax.\nThat night we shared mezcales, a distilled alcoholic beverage made\
  \ from agave. One straight mezcal, or two, made conversation evolve from who we\
  \ are and where we come from into love stories, heartbreaks and different philosophies\
  \ of life and the world we live in. We then fell asleep under the starry sky.\n\
  We woke up ready to meet the rapids. Seven people in a raft working together to\
  \ cross the river downstream is not enough to define what was going on. While my\
  \ mind and body were focused on handling the paddles, I\u2019m sure I had a ridiculous\
  \ smile from ear to ear while descending that river. What a fun experience! Our\
  \ guide, Carlos, a light-hearted and funny local guy, explained to us that the water\
  \ level was the highest they have had so far that year.\nAfter three hours of intense\
  \ river currents and drops, a flat ride marked the end of this adventure. The vehicle\
  \ that would take us back to town was a funny combination of bus and truck. There\
  \ wasn\u2019t enough space in the back, so I sat in the front cabin with Jos\xE9\
  , the driver, a wrinkled and noble man who shared his concern about the government\
  \ wanting to build a dam at the river. This would end with the tourism in the town\
  \ and thus the income from almost everybody there, yet he remained optimistic.\n\
  After a steam bath in a temazcal and a refreshing regional herb tea called \u201C\
  Zacate-Lim\xF3n\u201D, we were ready to go back home. The beauty of a small town\
  \ in my own country and its friendly and hard-working people surprised me in such\
  \ a delightful way that I wasn\u2019t even expecting. Sometimes we travel too far\
  \ when magic is also right next to us."
