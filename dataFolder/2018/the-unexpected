Text: Great,my parents always had a way of spoiling my plans ,I and my friends had
  planned out how we were going to spend our vacation, we tagged it "just us girls",we
  were going to put on some make up ,go shopping ,have a couple of drinks ,and talk
  about life and boys, no conversation felt complete without them. "I and your mom
  have decided that we'll be leaving for Nigeria a day after Tommorrow, we thought
  it's high time you knew more about where you came from,I hope you understand darling
  "my dad said ,my mom stood firmly beside my dad as a sign of her approval,I could
  clearly see the conspiracy, I felt like screaming and breaking anything my hand
  came in contact with , but I held myself back because my eighteenth  birthday was
  around the corner  and if i wanted the car of my dreams I needed to be on my best
  behaviour and obey their every command,then I gave a weak smile as a sign of approval.
  Mom and dad went shopping the next day for dad's family  and her's too ,I was sure
  one thing ,this vacation was going to be horrible, my parents were Nigerians we
  lived in Alberta in Canada where dad had a cleaning company and mom work as a nurse,I
  packed a few of my summer dresses, I heard its very hot in Nigeria, the day after
  we left for the airport after fourteen hours fifty eight minutes,we landed in Lagos
  then took the next flight to port harcourt city ,it was extremely hot I put in my
  ear plugs in my ear as I listen to some slow music to cool off in the heat,as i
  looked out the mirror to feed my eye ,it was different for what I imagined everytime
  I thought about Africa I always imagined people putting on   animal skin with spears
  dancing around fire ,this was different it was beautiful ,it was hot ,full of life
  and the people were so full of life and energy at a point I started feeling drowsy
  I hadn't slept enough for a while,after about an hour the car halted, in front of
  a bungalow with hedges i had never seen so much sand apart from the beach of course
  , dad brought out our luggage and paid the taxi driver when we walked in a man sat
  on  a wooden chair wearing a loose and saggy singlet with a cloth tied loosely on
  his waist with a radio on his hand when he looked up he seemed so suprised and beamed
  with joy my dad ran to hug him they were chatting until they pointed at me ,he gave
  me a hug and surprisingly was so fluent in English we chatted we were welcomed with
  so much and care dad's mom was overjoyed she never let me go of her sight i was
  enjoying this
