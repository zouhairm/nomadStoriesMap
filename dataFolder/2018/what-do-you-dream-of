Text: "The landscape below me looked like a place that I'd never had expected existing\
  \ on our earth. I intensively watched out for any change but there was none; scraggy\
  \ grey-beige chains of mountains whose iced over peaks rose to our plane. I tried\
  \ to focus on any details trying to notice any change but even though each mountain\
  \ was different the details only seemed to replicate.  \n \nIt was on my way back\
  \ to Germany- six fulfilled and crowded weeks in India made up my most recent past\
  \ and had become a part of my own identification, more than I ever had expected.\
  \ All the smells, the noises, all the tastes and all the places... the people, the\
  \ degrees that have made me sweat and the kilometers that made me tired but satisfied\
  \ in the evening. \nIndia was inside me, no matter if I wanted it to be that way\
  \ or not. I met so many people, and even if I haven't even talked one word to them\
  \ but had only looked in their eyes sometimes;\nthe people I met on my way made\
  \ me meet some unknown parts of my own.\nI got surprised and filled with joy but\
  \ I got also scared and filled with anger and questions. \n \nI don't want to list\
  \ them up. But there was this one question that again came up to my mind on my flight\
  \ back while I was looking down below.\n\"What do those people dream of?\" - what\
  \ do those people dream of who live in these spaciously plateaus and those narrow\
  \ valleys below me.\nWhat do people who never had the possibility to leave their\
  \ own village dream of? \nAnd what do people dream of who don't even know about\
  \ the countries that share a border with their own? - Just because no one ever told\
  \ them. Just because they didn't have access to adequate education.\nThese minutes\
  \ on the plane made me realize how glad I am to be able to travel. I felt so privileged\
  \ that I had the possibility to learn all these numbers and facts that seemed so\
  \ unimportant back when I had to study them in my geography class.  \nThere still\
  \ is this question on my mind. I want to know what people around the world dream\
  \ of. Does your knowledge about the world restrict your dreams or are one's dreams\
  \ automatically restricted by insufficient education, job prospects and opportunities?\
  \ \nI want to find out what other youths around the world dream of.\nWhat do you\
  \ dream of?"
