Text: "I called her that day, my usual 5 min monthly call - \u201CGrandma, can you\
  \ hear me? I\u2019m going to visit you, this time is true\u201D\nI was flying back\
  \ to my hometown, Majagua. A town in the middle of Cuba, in the middle of nowhere.\
  \ I had to visit my family, whom we left when I was a kid. Families living together\
  \ in the same house is a common scenario in the island, and my mom and I used to\
  \ live with my grandparents, we were all they had, but we left. The ride from Havana\
  \ to Majagua was in an almendron that took us 8 hours on the road, which we shared\
  \ with tractors and horses, I felt lost. I got out of the car to a dirt road, the\
  \ same one where I spent my childhood nights playing with my Cuban friends. I cried\
  \ when I saw my grandma, she said I looked like my mom, not like the girl they waved\
  \ goodbye at the airport 10 years ago. I had a broken family, just like the rest\
  \ of Cuban immigrants. No alarms are needed here, roosters sing punctually every\
  \ morning, a new day begins. Our monotony is nothing compared to the routines of\
  \ this place, how people move forward with it is what surprises me.  One night abuela\
  \ and I went for a walk, streets were as dark as a black amber.\n\u201CGrandma,\
  \ is there something good about living here?\u201D\n \u201CYes\u201D, she said \u2013\
  \ \u201CI went to college for free\u201D\n\u201CBut, you were an accountant for\
  \ 40 years and you made $5 per month.  How is that good?\u201D\n\u201CWell, we also\
  \ have free healthcare\u201D - she replied.\n\u201CAnd yet, what do you do when\
  \ most of the doctors are sent abroad and there are no supplies to cure you?\u201D\
  \ \u2013 \u201CGrandma, what about freedom? Do you feel free?\u201D\n\u201CYes,\
  \ I am free, but be careful what you say to others, we should not speak some truths\u201D\
  \nI understood it was time for me to stop. I did not want to make her feel bad,\
  \ so I decided to learn Cuba on my own. I spent 3 weeks there with no technology.\
  \ There were afternoons we would go to the river in the back of an old truck, waving\
  \ everyone in town as we passed them by. \u201CIs it weird that I feel free here?\u201D\
  \ \u2013 I would think to myself. Free as I slowly walked the streets filled with\
  \ horse poop (popular way of transportation), or as I visited my old school and\
  \ saw kids' smiles, free as I jumped from a cliff in the river, or as I forgot of\
  \ all insignificant things that were keeping me locked away from the world. I learned\
  \ freedom in the least expected place. I understood that Cubans travel because they\
  \ need to, not because they want to. Cuba hurts me, and yet amazes me.   \n\u201C\
  Grandma, I love you, I\u2019ll be back again soon\u201D."
