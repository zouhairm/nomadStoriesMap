Text: "The last thing I expected to find in the small town of Buttevant, County Cork,\
  \ Ireland was a cemetery filled with the graves of my ancestors. It was my first\
  \ trip to Ireland, which I had thoroughly researched and planned, taking my mom\
  \ there for her 65th birthday. She has some Irish blood but most of it is on my\
  \ dad\u2019s side, as his great grandfather came to America from Ireland during\
  \ the Great Famine. I knew a little about our family\u2019s history but really nothing\
  \ about Buttevant. On our eighth day in the land of saints and scholars, we spent\
  \ the night at a B&B in Cork City with plans to then go to Buttevant and the Rock\
  \ of Cashel. When we left the next morning and drove to Buttevant, I had no idea\
  \ what to expect. All I knew is this was the town where the Lenihan family came\
  \ from. As we entered the town, I decided we should stop at St. Mary\u2019s Church\
  \ to see what we might find, since the church was often the center of any town in\
  \ Europe. We entered the church and I approached a lady and asked if she knew of\
  \ any Lenihan\u2019s in town? She said there was one she knew of and stated where\
  \ she lived. Since I didn\u2019t know the town and didn\u2019t have much time, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t going to show up at her door. We then entered the cemetery next to\
  \ the church and that is when the unexpected occurred. Within this relatively small\
  \ cemetery we found that the Lenihan\u2019s were a dominant presence. There were\
  \ various spellings of my last name, but I counted at least a dozen of my ancestors\
  \ were born and buried in Buttevant. Lenihan is not as well known of an Irish last\
  \ name in America as say O\u2019Connor or McDermott, so it was great to see we had\
  \ been one of the dominant families of this town. I was purposely wearing my Lenihan\
  \ coat of arms t-shirt and proudly had a photograph taken standing in front of the\
  \ church where my ancestors had obviously worshipped, gotten married and likely\
  \ attended baptisms, confirmations, holidays and funerals. I also photographed some\
  \ of the graves with plans to do more research later. As someone who thoroughly\
  \ researches and plans all my trips with full schedules and detailed itineraries,\
  \ this was truly an unexpected find and one of my most memorable experiences from\
  \ over a decade of extensive global travel. We all seek to find out more about our\
  \ ancestors and heritage and discovering so many Lenihan\u2019s in the town where\
  \ we originated was inspiring and exciting. Having traveled to over twenty countries,\
  \ this still stands out to me as one of the last things I expected."
