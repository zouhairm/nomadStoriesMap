Text: "When the plane landed in Chicago, United States, I was excited and scared.After\
  \ many trips, that was the first time I left alone.I was going to meet my American\
  \ relatives I had accidentally found on FB.After chatting with them and having discovered\
  \ that my great-grandfather had a second family overseas, I was invited.It was a\
  \ bad time of my life. My boyfriend was always busy with his job and never had time\
  \ for me.I just wanted to relax with a vacation.I found Lynda and Jim waiting for\
  \ me at the airport. They were a very nice and friendly old couple who were curious\
  \ about a part of the family kept secret.With a taxi we arrived downtown.Chicago\
  \ was chaotic, full of buildings that stood one above the other and one taller than\
  \ the other.On the sidewalks of State Street, people walked fast without paying\
  \ attention to the Christmas lights and the colored signs.We stopped in front of\
  \ Macy's.The entrance of the department stores was announced by a dark green clock\
  \ with Roman numbers and very large trumpets pointing upwards, almost as if they\
  \ were going to play. I felt small in there and I looked up all the time! The shop\
  \ was huge and I could see at least 6 floors of shops. We booked a table in the\
  \ Walnut Room, a large dining room with a beautiful, illuminated Christmas tree\
  \ in the middle.After lunch Lynda proposed to go to the Aon Center, a skyscraper\
  \ located on East Randolph Street, with 83 floors and the third tallest building\
  \ in Chicago. In front of a glass of wine in the hall of the Mid America Club, on\
  \ the 80th floor of this Center, I could have a 360-degree panoramic view of the\
  \ city\u2019s skyline, of Millennium Park, Gold Coast and Lake Michigan, the largest\
  \ lake in the United States,with an area of 57,760 square kilometers.The day ended\
  \ at Millennium Park, one of the largest public parks and the largest garden in\
  \ the world with 24.5 hectares of surface.The main element of the park was the Jay\
  \ Pritzker Pavillion,with 5000 seats and a surrounding lawn. It was made of stainless\
  \ steel tubes and plates and titanium volutes that create a unique sound effect.In\
  \ the square there was the Cloud Gate, a sculpture of 110 tons of steel nicknamed\
  \ \"The Bean\", for its shape.As I watched the lights of the buildings move away\
  \ from the car window, I realized how important the family was.I had felt like a\
  \ daughter in that almost unknown family. The last thing I expected was to understand\
  \ that I would leave my boyfriend to look for someone with my same dream: to create\
  \ a family that makes you always feel loved."
