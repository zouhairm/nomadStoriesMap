Text: "Two hours north of Chiang Mai, Thailand\u2019s Phrao District is deeply rural,\
  \ human activity held between verdant forests and rolling farmland. Ali and I are\
  \ visiting the organizations that supply our American social enterprise with local\
  \ handicrafts. Our team hopes to combat rural poverty by connecting Thai artisans\
  \ to the U.S. market. Aid through trade.\n\nHalf of Yai\u2019s workshop is outside\
  \ under a metal awning. Overhead, silk thread hangs in various stages of the dye\
  \ process. Drops fall from the wet coils, joining the cadence of rain and jungle\
  \ sounds. Yai, head shaven and frame slight in nun\u2019s robes, radiates capability.\
  \ Her strong hands pull down a loop of silk, stretching it taut to show her craft.\n\
  \nPloy, our local guide and an artisan herself, translates Yai\u2019s lyrical Thai\
  \ into English.\n\n\u201CSee this black? This took many dyeings because we cannot\
  \ make black naturally here. It is really a very dark brown.\u201D\n\nToday, we\
  \ are here to learn the origin of our products. Yai\u2019s stylish scarves sell\
  \ well on our website. Through transparency and case studies, we aim to show that\
  \ fashion can be responsible.\n\nAli, our main buyer, leans in, body buzzing with\
  \ interest.\n\n\u201CSo, where do you grow the silk?\u201D\n\nPloy explains, \u201C\
  We\u2019ve had a terrible time growing Thai silk. It\u2019s so delicate. The worms\
  \ keep dying. No, we buy it from India. Quicker that way. Cheaper.\u201D\n\nDisappointment.\
  \ This does not fit our artisanal narrative of local products from local sources,\
  \ but we\u2019ll find a way to spin it. We nod politely. Yai smiles. She resumes\
  \ wringing out the silk, unconcerned.\n\n\u201CThis silk is good silk,\u201D Ploy\
  \ translates Yai\u2019s murmuring voice.\n\nOnly a couple other women are in the\
  \ workshop. The rainy season has just begun, heralding the start of rice planting.\
  \ In the next five months, the district will make most of its annual income from\
  \ agriculture. Young people return from the cities, men ready their tools, and middle-aged\
  \ women, the warrior women, continue working, moving from looms to land.\n\nBabies,\
  \ bellies, bills do not wait for the rainy season. In the dry months, sons and daughters\
  \ work in the cities leaving grandmothers to watch grandchildren. These women pick\
  \ up handicraft jobs. They join Yai\u2019s workshop, which grows and contracts with\
  \ the community\u2019s need. Surplus scarves set aside to fill our demand.\n\nWe\
  \ came expecting to lead people out of hardship. We are needed, but there are already\
  \ leaders. Phrao\u2019s women skillfully balance the seasonal economy. They seek\
  \ out opportunity. American dollars. Indian silk."
