Text: "The known is safe and comfortable. The unknown is scary and always keeps you\
  \ guessing.\n\nWhen I decided to leave my life in Colorado and head towards the\
  \ open sea, I had no clue what awaited me - I was both elated and terrified. My\
  \ entire life was packed into a single, very large bag and I\u2019d agreed to spend\
  \ the next 6 months on a 152-foot boat, not knowing a soul. The moment I stepped\
  \ on board the National Geographic Sea Bird I knew I was on the brink of an unforgettable\
  \ adventure.\n\nIt began in Alaska - a magical, breathtaking and seemingly untouched\
  \ land. Each morning, I would crawl out of my coffin of a bed, snatch the nearest\
  \ cup of coffee and wander out onto the boat deck, only to be completely undone\
  \ by the indescribable landscape that surrounded me. Everyday was a new experience,\
  \ forever burned into my memory.\n\nOne evening, the sky was nearly dark with a\
  \ slight orange haze on the horizon - leftover traces of the day resisting the night.\
  \ The air was brisk and cold yet invigorating, all that could be heard was the smooth\
  \ ocean water breaking against the boat as she slowly glided on the open sea. There\
  \ wasn\u2019t a cloud to be seen or a single man-made light to silence what the\
  \ night sky had to say. We were completely alone, just the heavens and myself. The\
  \ Milky Way shone brilliantly and shooting stars fell all around as though they\
  \ were hurried to get somewhere. Then, off in the distance, above the mountaintops,\
  \ I saw them - the Northern Lights. Vibrant, green and glorious, they danced through\
  \ the night sky as if they were being tickled. The smile couldn\u2019t be wiped\
  \ off of my face and no one could have lured me inside. I was exactly where I needed\
  \ to be - alive, at peace and completely content. I sat under those bright, streaming\
  \ ribbons and lost track of time until the lights grew faint and exhaustion hit.\
  \ I floated to bed that night knowing that if this was the reason for my journey,\
  \ it was more than enough.\n\nThe summer of my departure, my little sister was obsessed\
  \ with living life and not wasting time with such nonsense like... sleep.\n\n\u201C\
  You\u2019ll never remember the nights you slept well.\u201D She\u2019d say to me\
  \ as she pulled me out of my warm bed to go on some midnight enterprise. \n\nI\u2019\
  m grateful to her, because those words ran through my mind every night as I\u2019\
  d finish up my tiresome 16-hour workday, pining for sleep. Without that advice,\
  \ I could have missed out on one of the most unforgettable memories of my life."
