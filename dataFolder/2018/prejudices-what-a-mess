Text: "Sapa was my third destination on my solo trip through Vietnam. I admit I booked\
  \ my hostel at the last moment because I didn\u2019t know if I would manage to get\
  \ to the sleeping bus after getting a belly bug\u2026 While searching, a curious\
  \ name and picture caught my eye and it was a \"Capsule Hotel\", kind of bizarre\
  \ for Vietnam, but I decided to give it a try and I am glad I did cause it was a\
  \ really interesting place and I met friendly local people there. The hotel was\
  \ a modern building but instead of having bunk beds, there were Japanese capsules,\
  \ which were pretty big and long, and you had space for small items and charging\
  \ plugs inside. And if you kept your capsule open you had an amazing view of Sapa's\
  \ landscape, it was a shame that I couldn't see much because of the fog. \nAs I\
  \ arrived before check-in time I was invited for tea and had a chat with the owner,\
  \ who is Vietnamese, but surprisingly studied his Degree in Ukraine, so he could\
  \ speak Russian, and as I was born in Belarus I do too! What a coincidence to find\
  \ somebody who lived in the place where I used to go on summers as a kid. \nAt that\
  \ moment I could say I was really shocked of meeting Russian speaking people in\
  \ Vietnam cause I didn't think they were into going on vacation to South-East Asia\
  \ instead of Mediterranean Sea area. But must say I was wrong because since the\
  \ equator of my trip (Center and South Vietnam) I could hear Russian on every corner.\
  \ Lesson learnt!\nAfter Bao Chau (my new friend's name) helped me to enrol on a\
  \ tour for the next day, he also talked with so much passion about H\xE0 Giang Province\
  \ and that I should go by motorbike through there and discover the mountain area\
  \ of Vietnam. Bao Chau put me as well in contact with a couple that was also staying\
  \ in the hotel and have already done that trip. I must say I was surprised at seeing\
  \ so many local people visiting their own country, which is not so common in Spain.\
  \ Finally, I was invited for dinner with hotel staff and we exchanged more life\
  \ stories; on how did I ended in Spain and about my trip in Vietnam, and also about\
  \ him and his family and on how they had to go back to Vietnam after Russia-Ukraine\
  \ conflict begun in 2014.\nLater during my trip, I started appreciating the moments\
  \ I exchanged with locals in remote places, where they are so welcoming even if\
  \ they don't know English and how in very touristic cities you can be scammed because\
  \ of the exploitation of tourism. It makes me think about how can we intervene so\
  \ it won't get worse?"
