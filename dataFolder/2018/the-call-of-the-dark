Text: "I used to pride myself for not being a typical Indian. You see, we Indians\
  \ are one of the most racist group of people in the world. We would look at the\
  \ color of your skin and come to snap judgements about you, and ourselves. Born\
  \ in the South of India, where most of the population is dark-skinned, I shouldn't\
  \ have felt this. But there's no escape when most people around deem you less attractive,\
  \ even as a child, compared to your fairer skinned cousins and friends.\n\nDecades\
  \ later, after being at the receiving end of many such judgements, I found choice.\
  \ I realized that while I can't help what others think, I can choose how I react\
  \ to sly references equating  the colour of my skin and my worth. I stopped being\
  \ weighed down. Life was easier, lighter,  afterwards and I used to pride myself\
  \ as liberated Indian. \n\nIn 2015, I had my first chance to visit Africa. I was\
  \ excited to finally visit a place which always called out to me. The wildlife,\
  \ the cultural symbols and the raw connection to nature all excited me. It was with\
  \ a lot of excitement that I boarded my flight from Mumbai. Amsterdam was where\
  \ I changed flights, and till the time I boarded the flight to Accra, I was alright.\
  \ \n\nMy seat was between two tired Ghanians who were returning from London. I settled\
  \ in with my book and music, but realized after sometime that I was not comfortable.\
  \ There was an uneasiness creeping up on me and after a while, I started breaking\
  \ out in cold sweat. Unable to place the source of discomfort, I was  fiddling with\
  \ the airconditioning and my playlist. Then it struck me that I am stuck inbetween\
  \ two \"black\" people, and I was going to a place which has been portrayed  as\
  \ savage and \"uncultured\". \n\nAll the years of my own struggle with being dark-skinned\
  \ took a back seat. The conditioning by a society (i daren't say culture) about\
  \ the colour of the skin and the worth of the person dominated my racing mind. All\
  \ this would have been seeping out of me, as my co-travellers were happy to ignore\
  \ me and be in their own corner spaces. I lost track of time and fell asleep. I\
  \ dont remember dreaming, but I woke up a different man. \n\nMy ma had these words\
  \ for me as a child \"but darling you are the colour of wheat and honey, as your\
  \ heart is\". These words ran through soul, and I reached across borders of mind\
  \ and society and said \"Hi... \"\n\nI returned from Africa 3 weeks later, and still\
  \ carry the memories of a most wonderful time in my life, understand completely,\
  \ the reason for the callling."
