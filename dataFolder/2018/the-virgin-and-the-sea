Text: "\u201CAre you alright?,\u201D she asked me, as I clutched my fingertips over\
  \ the bench seat amidships, the backpack held tight between my legs. The slimness\
  \ of the sea goo under the wood loosened my grip. The yacht\u2019s deck rocking\
  \ over the waves, the sun at its peak, my colleague, a bikini-clad beauty as stunning\
  \ as your 14-year crush can be, asking me what I felt.\nThe girl I always loved\
  \ quietly had finally paid attention to me, and I had no clue of what to do with\
  \ it.\n\u201CSure,\u201D I replied without standing up to her. I couldn\u2019t do\
  \ it without trembling, fearing I would slip and slide from under the silver guardrails\
  \ straight to death in tropical seas. Perks of not knowing how to swim.\n\u201C\
  Really?\u201D, she leered as while reaching for my shoulder. \u201CYou seem lonely\
  \ here, all by yourself.\u201D\nWe were about 250 km away from my home, Crici\xFA\
  ma, Brazil, in a yacht, named Casablanca, was a 150ft-long blue and white ship famous\
  \ for hosting tourist trips by the southern waters of Florian\xF3polis. It was a\
  \ weird high school year\u2019s end trip with sixty people \u2013 none to be counted\
  \ as friends. Many of them, far more amused than afraid, had never sailed in such\
  \ circumstances.\n\u201CCome, let\u2019s hang around by the pool.\u201D\nShe pulled\
  \ my arm. I was sensible as a hormone proximity fuze. Looking at the endless horizon\
  \ and the waves over her shoulder, and then to her leering, I wouldn\u2019t be able\
  \ to say no. Any siren would be left in shame if tried to put a spell on me as strong\
  \ as hers. \nStill wearing shorts, I rushed to put on my trunks in the first bathroom\
  \ I could. The me in the mirror had many anxieties to stab at me. Would she turn\
  \ away when seeing my skinny, bare chest, a handful of hairs in its middle? How\
  \ would I move in to kiss her lips? Would she push me away and laugh at me?\nNever\
  \ there was a man as eager as I to know it.\nTreading carefully towards the aft,\
  \ the buzzing engines cackled with the splashes of water and laughter in the pool.\
  \ I dipped slowly in the water, realizing it wouldn\u2019t drown me if I stood up.\n\
  Many were there, but no sign of the girl.\nMy heart skipped a beat when she showed\
  \ up, waving at me. I felt the air slowly fading as she jumped at the pool. Coming\
  \ in my direction, I could barely hold myself.\nThen she extended her arms to the\
  \ guy right next at me, and they embraced each other in a long kiss.\n\u201CYou\
  \ better now?\u201D, she asked, taking a break from his mouth.\nI squirmed to turn\
  \ my pain into a smile before leaving the pool back to the lonely bench.\n\u201C\
  Sure. I\u2019m way better now.\u201D"
