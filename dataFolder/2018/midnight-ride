Text: "I was sitting on the couch, just staring out the window on a breezy summer\
  \ night. \nReflections of the streetlights bounced off the window in an array of\
  \ colorful streaks. I was entranced. \nI heard a motorcycle approach. \nA single\
  \ round headlight parked in front of the window. \nWhen the rider cut the engine,\
  \ the streetlight reflected orange light on the bike.  \nIt was like watching a\
  \ scene from a movie. The rider took off his helmet coolly, whipped his leg off\
  \ the bike, and walked away. \nBrando would have been proud. \n\nI sat there and\
  \ admired that beautiful machine for about twenty minutes. \nEventually, I thought\
  \ it was a good time for bed so I walked toward the stairs. \nI noticed the rider\
  \ sitting in the window with the girl who worked at the hostel. \nI told the guy\
  \ in Spanish \"I like your motorcycle.\"\nHe replied, \"you like it?\" And tossed\
  \ me the keys. \"Take it for a ride.\"\nI was in shock for a moment. I stared dumbfounded\
  \ at the keys in my hand.  I told him, 'I don't have boots or a helmet.'\nHe replied,\
  \ \"No importa.\"(Not important). \n\"Okay.\" \nI wasn't going to miss my chance.\
  \ \nI walked over to the bike, he helped me start it. I gave it gas, released the\
  \ clutch smoothly and took off. \nIt was the most alive I have ever felt. \nAs I\
  \ rode down that empty street with sunglasses on my forehead, flip flops on my feet,\
  \ I felt like the world was mine. \nI shifted into third, then fourth. The machine\
  \ roared. I howled. \n\nI had dreamt of moments like these my whole life. My soul\
  \ had never felt so free and the breeze, blew right through me. \n\nThere were no\
  \ cars on the road. So on I rode.\nEvery second felt like eternity, and I, was immortal.\n\
  There were no people, no cars...the night was all mine.\n\nOnce I was content I\
  \ veered back towards the Hostel.\n \nI rolled up on the lawn, cut the engine, and\
  \ gave the guy his keys. \nI thanked him as if he raised me from the dead, and went\
  \ up to bed the happiest man in that town.\n\n\nAt a little place off the beach\
  \ in Punta del Este, Uruguay I had the night of my life.\nOnce in a while your reality\
  \ surpasses your dreams, and it truly is magnificent."
