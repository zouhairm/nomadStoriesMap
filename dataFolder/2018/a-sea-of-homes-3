Text: "As I tried to balance on a rocking boat while looking through binoculars, I\
  \ spotted something. It looked like someone doodled over the lens, but as the boat\
  \ went up and down with the waves, that weird scribble stood still, laid on the\
  \ surface of the Sea of Cortez, when a splash broke the tension of not knowing what\
  \ was in front of me: \u201CIt\u2019s alive\u201D I yelled.\nI was in Mexico to\
  \ use drones to locate, identify and collect evidences of illegal fishing activities.\
  \ For six weeks, my home was a 56m ship owned by a marine conservation organization.\
  \ The words \u201CAnti Poaching\u201D on both sides and the grey camouflage paint\
  \ job sure gave me confidence, knowing not a lot of poachers would want to face\
  \ such beast looking vessel.\nMy first task was to fly over an illegal fishing camp,\
  \ but to be in flight range I\u2019d need to be on waters too shallow for the ship.\
  \ So a small rigid inflatable boat was dispatched with me and three other crewmates.\
  \ As we got closer to land, trying to find the camp with binoculars to figure out\
  \ the direction the drone should fly to, something caught our attention.\nA long\
  \ fishing net was drifting in a protected area. I thought we\u2019d deal with that\
  \ as a piece of marine debris that we\u2019d remove and discard, but as the boat\
  \ got closer, a huge fishtail splashed water up like it was asking for help. As\
  \ we rushed to reach the net, I pulled my personal knife from my pocket, anticipating\
  \ what I was afraid of. It was a 1.5m endangered Totoaba that had been exhaustingly\
  \ trying to free itself from the deadly net that didn\u2019t even tried to escape\
  \ my hand when I grabbed it.\nOn that moment, the hurry to save that fish was playing\
  \ in slow motion in front of my eyes. As the shiny silver fishtail started to slip\
  \ from my hand, my other hand sliced through the nylon net with my knife. My crewmates\
  \ were cutting the net around the fish head, and that\u2019s when I was able to\
  \ look straight into that creature\u2019s eyes. All I could think was how a species\
  \ that has been living there long before any human was being driven towards extinction\
  \ in its own home. Everyone stopped and watched, as there was no more net around\
  \ the Totoaba that flapped its tail so fast we couldn\u2019t even tell the direction\
  \ it went.\nWhen I accepted the invitation to be part of this trip, I knew I\u2019\
  d be at sea and my job was to see things from a distance. The last thing I expected\
  \ was to make a local connection, and that made me realize even the most remote\
  \ square meter of this life abundant planet is someone\u2019s home."
