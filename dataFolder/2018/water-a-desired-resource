Text: "In 2013 I had a chance to travel to Kenya. My colleague John and I had taught\
  \ together for three years. He grew up in Kenya and extended the invitation to visit.\
  \ John\u2019s family lives in a small village outside of Kibwezi. John goes home\
  \ each summer during our break. We spoke about it at length and finally, I was able\
  \ to made the journey. \nAfter spending time in the capital city of Nairobi and\
  \ a few days on safari, I arrived in Kibwezi. During my travels all drinking water\
  \ had to be purchased, but plumbing was similar to New York. Hot water didn\u2019\
  t always work, but water ran from a faucet or hose. \nJohn and I spoke about the\
  \ basics before my trip so I was prepared. His family had an outhouse, and plumbing\
  \ was not installed his family home. What happened before my arrival, and I did\
  \ not see until I got there, was an elephant had gotten out of the nearby nature\
  \ preserve and had trampled the waterlines. The lines that reach two stations located\
  \ in the village did not work. Now water was brought via bicycles or people on foot.\
  \ The water came from Kibwezi central, in large jugs every morning. Each day water\
  \ was boiled over an open fire, to heat water for all of us to bath. Water was careful\
  \ poured out when one washed hands, for cooking and cleaning clothes. \nI went on\
  \ a tour of the water reservoir my second day. John and one of the local government\
  \ official were my guides. We drove into the forest, then once the road ended, traveled\
  \ by foot. We continued down narrow path and came to a pond. I could see where the\
  \ waterlines were laid, the elephant footprints, and the cracked cement where it\
  \ had been crushed. There were three channels, \u201Cone for each village\u201D\
  \ John informed me. I was shocked. \u201CThis was the water that runs to three local\
  \ villages?\u201D I thought. The reservoir was smaller than ponds I had played growing\
  \ up and wouldn\u2019t cover a city blocks. \"How could it be three villages water\
  \ source?\" I pondered this question throughout my time in Kenya.  \nWhen I came\
  \ back to New York City, I took less time in the shower. I appreciated the water\
  \ running from my faucet at any day or time. My trip perked and interest in the\
  \ local reservoirs as well as how water moved in and out of the city. I did some\
  \ research and walked the Old Croton Aqueduct, which brought water into New York\
  \ City before the lines were moved higher upstate. My trip to Kenya highlighted\
  \ how precious a resource water is and I will never forget the lengths that some\
  \ people have to go through for it."
