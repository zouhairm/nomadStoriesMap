Text: "A magical place is unfolding my eyes, after driving for 2.5 hours from Bardufoss\
  \ airport to the very end of the island of Senja in Northern Norway. This former\
  \ little fisher house harbours spacious common areas including a grand piano, a\
  \ caf\xE9, a stage/theater space. Step by step I discover crazy micro-apartments\
  \ and cozy rooms of about 3 to 4 sm, created individually in an astonishing and\
  \ charming way. Used are not the usual building materials, but local and recycled\
  \ things. One bedroom for example has a roof showing the universe\u2019s blue skies\
  \ painted on an old church door. Looking down, a rhomboid glass part cut out of\
  \ the wooden floor releases the view down to the sea. In rough spumes the water\
  \ hits the timber piles. The latest bedroom of the by now more than 25 sleeping\
  \ places in this small house was built on the backside of the facade as a cube with\
  \ three sides glass only. So when the waves are high, you feel like inhaled by the\
  \ ocean. \nThe name of this place is Kr\xE5keslottet \u2013 covering more than just\
  \ a title for tiny house. It became an artist residency and every year in June a\
  \ music and arts festival is coming off called \u2018artijuli\u2019. It shows the\
  \ richness of Europe\u2019s north end culture. Can you imagine this inspiring atmosphere\
  \ of creativity and personal freedom? Incredibly tempting turquoise-blue waters\
  \ and fine sanded white beaches make it unbelievable that also in July the water\
  \ temperature is low, just above zero degrees. Even though the climate is quite\
  \ mild compared with the midlands further inside Norway, in the M\xE5lselv region\
  \ where winters of -40\xB0C constantly are absolutely normal. \nA pretty, about\
  \ six metres long kitchen table at Kr\xE5keslottet invites to sit together. Georg\
  \ Blichfeldt carpentered it himself. He explained that Siberian tree trunks drift\
  \ around the North Pole for several times before stranding at the coast of Northern\
  \ Norway. The wood shows special patterns and an individual surface created also\
  \ by salt water worms, leaving black graze holes.\nThis time out space is so far\
  \ up north that in Nov/Dec you can watch whales swimming by. But even if this place\
  \ seems apart from civilisation: it is not! All infrastructures are provided by\
  \ the Norwegian system: internet works perfectly and, believe it or not, the head\
  \ of this residency, Georg Blichfeldt, is a pretty good dancer of Argentine Tango!\
  \ So, if you are up for a Midsummer nights-Tango (like me) at an area where it\u2019\
  s not getting dark between May & August, you are always very welcome."
