Text: "While wandering around Siyob Bazaar, i could see Samarkand bread everywhere,\
  \ famously known as \u2018Samarkand Non\u2019. I couldn\u2019t fail to notice a\
  \ woman of enormous size staring at me from behind one of the counters. I reckoned\
  \ it was a general inquisitiveness towards tourists. Her eyes sparkled, she grinned\
  \ exposing all her golden teeth. With husky gentle voice she gestured me to try\
  \ fresh nons. After a heavy Uzbeki breakfast at the Inn, there was no way i could\
  \ do justice to a massive non. I hesitantly declined her with Rahmat, the only word\
  \ i had grasped since my arrival in Tashkent a day before. \n\nWhen she saw me moving\
  \ away, she leaped from her seat and landed in front me. Still holding that infectious\
  \ smile, she pushed the Non in my face. Not knowing what else to do, i tried to\
  \ bargain for the Non i didn\u2019t want. Reluctantly I passed 10000 SOM thinking\
  \ that would leave me in peace. Undeterred, she threw her arms around me and tried\
  \ saying something i failed to decipher. This created a little commotion around\
  \ us.\n\nThen something really strange happened. She opened few buttons of her blouse\
  \ and started pointing at her sagging breasts...I was aghast! What have I done to\
  \ deserve this? Hiding behind a veil of embarrassment i searched for answers on\
  \ unknown faces. While I was anxious, the onlookers seemed to be in awe! Just when\
  \ I was preparing for a verbal assault, familiar words fell on my ears...Apollo...Dilli\u2026\
  Apollo...Dilli...\n\nI turned around to look at her once again and i could spot\
  \ a large vertical scar on her chest. At that moment chaos in my mind settled. I\
  \ could relate to her excitement; i realized she had a heart surgery in Apollo hospital\
  \ in Delhi. While she continued blabbering, Rahmat... Alloh\u2026 Apollo\u2026 was\
  \ all i could comprehend. Strangers explained; for her the surgery at Apollo was\
  \ nothing short of a miracle! She hugged me and showered me with kisses. She rushed\
  \ to a stall nearby and brought strawberries! When i tried to pay she cupped my\
  \ face in her palms; i could feel her warm breath of gratitude on me! I was overwhelmed\
  \ with such tenderness from a complete stranger. I just happened to be from a country\
  \ which gave her new life. Her name was Umida, which means hope. For Umida everything\
  \ from India represented hope; hope to live longer, hope to play with her grandchildren\
  \ one day! \n\nUzbekistan and India share grand historical ties which hold a special\
  \ place in my heart. The encounter with Umida that afternoon sealed that bond forever!"
