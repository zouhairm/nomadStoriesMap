Text: "I had left my secure and stable job at a great multinational company after\
  \ 4 years living the life of my parents dreams: I travelled the world, had a fancy\
  \ car, cool house in a huge town, and friends who could afford go to expensive Japanese\
  \ restaurants on Tuesdays with me. But I simply couldn`t fulfill my soul at all.\
  \ After all this time, I had to take my time and see what life was planning for\
  \ me. Finally, I bought a ticket to Brasilia with some friends, and our plan was\
  \ to visit Chapada dos Veadeiros, a spiritual and mystical place with amazing waterfalls,\
  \ and a very strong level of energy. Some people say there are portals to other\
  \ dimensions in there. \n\nThe three days felt like a month. Time was not linear\
  \ there, I mean it! First, we saw a rainbow perfect arch just by the entrance of\
  \ the National Park. Our GPS App, that once said we would get to our final destination\
  \ by 8:45, suddenly changed it to 8:15 as we passed down the arch. The experiences\
  \ were going and it felt as we were walking inside of ourselves, remembering experiences\
  \ and meeting people from our past. A friend of mine even received a letter from\
  \ another-life`s friend in a book she bought in second-hand bookstore, and she knows\
  \ that as the letter had her name and birthdate on it. \n\nIn the last waterfall\
  \ we were visiting, I decided I wanted to stay in Chapada dos Veadeiros. I was feeling\
  \ too sad I had to go back to my regular life after all that magic. Also, it is\
  \ not that I still had something important to do back in town. I sat down to meditate\
  \ and claimed God (Life, Universe, whatever name it has) to give me a hint of what\
  \ I should do. Just in the same moment, a blue-dressed guy just came up from the\
  \ middle of the forest to ask us for a lift. He was blond, blue-eyed (almost transparent),\
  \ and definitely more blue than I can describe you, and he spoke to us in English.\n\
  \nWe got him in our car and started asking about his journey in Chapada and where\
  \ he was from. First of all he said he was from up-north and pointed to the sky.\
  \ Second thing, he started speaking Portuguese with a perfect brazilian accent.\
  \ Third, he could never stop smiling to me. Finally, we were curious about what\
  \ was his recommended place in Chapada for us to go, as he kindly answered: \"Inside\
  \ of yourselves, this is the best place to go and stay, wherever you are.\" \n\n\
  WHEREVER you are! I had my answer. \nOur blue guy said we could stop, got out of\
  \ the car, smile at us, and disappeared in the forest again."
