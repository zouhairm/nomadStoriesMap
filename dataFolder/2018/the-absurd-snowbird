Text: "Burrowed within the womb of Little Cottonwood Canyon sits, \u201Cthe most misunderstood\
  \ ski resort in the world,\u201D Snowbird, Utah. We pull in an hour before opening,\
  \ myself and three other rowdy snowboarders crammed in a compact sedan in typical\
  \ budget ski bum fashion. To the southeast, we catch a magnificent sunrise casting\
  \ a foggy cerise glow over Mount Baldy.  \n\nThe trail map reads like an inkblot\
  \ test with black and double black diamonds splattering the ski area. In a rush\
  \ of adrenaline urged excitement, we decide to take the infamous Aerial Tram straight\
  \ up 10,992 feet to Hidden Peak Summit. There is a quiet feeling of awe as the tram\
  \ floats upwards along the cable. I feel the blood rise to my cheek pressed against\
  \ the window from a welcome bite of cold. Before me, emerging from thickening clouds,\
  \ appears a legion of gouged out glens, craggy cliffs, and ravines only barely blanketed\
  \ by snow. This unforgiving topography, made more so by recent drought ravaging\
  \ the western Rocky Mountain region, beckons a risk taker. \n\nA surge of steaming\
  \ breath as the doors to the tram open and we are released to the screaming of wind\
  \ and snow. Up here, the weather has turned the sky dark with dense nimbostratus,\
  \ like a veil in front of our eyes, immediately abolishing any sense of direction.\
  \ We decided to follow a pack of skiers, rather than risk tumbling down a precipice\
  \ hidden within the blizzard\u2019s smokescreen. It was this decision that would\
  \ push us all to the, literal, edge.\n\nThe trail, \u201CRoad to Provo,\u201D as\
  \ it appears on the map, looks like a mellow, catwalk-like traverse along a ridge\
  \ of the American Fork Twin Peaks. In reality, the path is a narrow, sloping trap\
  \ of ice and rock with a split down the middle like an earthquake fissure. To hold\
  \ the wall meant fighting through exposed rock and ruts, but to ride the edge was\
  \ to risk catching ice and falling into a cloud of unknowing. Teetering between\
  \ wall and edge with both eyes and knees so low they were almost touching the ground,\
  \ we were eventually led to a startling stop at the rim of Pipeline Bowl. There\
  \ was nowhere left to go, but down into an ominous shadow of snow.\n\nAn almost\
  \ blind ride down a steep mountain face is as humbling as it is frightening. Why\
  \ this resort has such an inauspicious reputation is perhaps because what you see\
  \ is truly what you get.  Leveraged by their one star campaign, Snowbird, maintains\
  \ an image of the unconquerable. It is a chilling pleasure to have had such an untamed\
  \ experience at a ski resort."
