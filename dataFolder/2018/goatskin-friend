Text: "I first noticed Glynis when she stood up to speak about the importance of increasing\
  \ the availability of birth control in Tanzania. The room was full of trainees and\
  \ program coordinators from different countries, all of whom were basically strangers.\
  \ We were two of 160 volunteers who would be paired and placed as working partners\
  \ throughout 80 selected villages across Iringa, Tanzania. Right after that training\
  \ session I introduced myself to Glynis and asked her to take a walk with me. \n\
  \nWe both understood what I had just asked for, and it was more than exercise. Taking\
  \ a walk with an unfamiliar volunteer expressed interest in partnering with them.\
  \ We were both 19. Glynis was bilingual and from the Tanzanian coastal metropolis\
  \ of Dar es Salaam. I was trying to be bilingual and from a suburban area outside\
  \ Kansas City. Glynis talked with me about wanting to attend University of Dar es\
  \ Salaam, the importance of family, and how she believed the law in her country\
  \ prohibiting homosexuality was wrong. She listened when I spoke too, and we bonded.\
  \ Three weeks later we were paired together, past friendship, and stopped using\
  \ each other\u2019s names. We called each other the Swahili word for sister (dada).\n\
  \nA few hours southwest of Iringa is Makoga, the village where Glynis and I lived\
  \ for five months, in three rooms of a six-room home. The main half of the house\
  \ belonged to a mother and daughter. We called them Mama and Bibi (grandma). The\
  \ home was on a farm, as were most homes in Makoga. An outdoor yard in the center\
  \ connected our three rooms to the entrance, shared washroom, and outhouse.\n\n\
  At first Glynis and I rarely left our bedroom after dark. If we did leave \u2013\
  \ mainly to use the outhouse \u2013 we went together. After a couple months living\
  \ in the village passed, we grew comfortable walking through the yard at night with\
  \ just a head lamp. What could happen? \n\nOn one such comfortable night I left\
  \ the bedroom to brush my teeth. As I walked across the dark yard, an unfamiliar\
  \ shape came into view. I walked closer and saw a stretched out figure lying motionless\
  \ in the corner of the yard I was approaching. I screamed. Glynis burst out of the\
  \ bedroom, saw what I saw, and began screaming too. Mama and Bibi quickly emerged\
  \ from their part of the house, looked at us, and howled with laughter. It was just\
  \ a goatskin, not a corpse. Glynis and I grew up on opposite sides of the planet,\
  \ but an oddly-placed animal hide at dusk will scare anyone who did not grow up\
  \ on a farm."
