Text: "Bangladesh - our neighboring country, quite misunderstood and grotesquely ignored\
  \ tugged at the strings of my heart. It was in 2017, the month was May when I first\
  \ travelled to Bangladesh. With a heart full of stereotypes and misconceptions I\
  \ was too quick to judge the country as untidy and filthy and the airport didn't\
  \ do anything to clear my notions. It was the roads and the sky high concrete monsters\
  \ that made a very strong case for the country. \nDhaka has a bountiful of sky rising\
  \ buildings that boast of beautiful and innovative vertical gardens. The clean and\
  \ wide roads say a different story than the ones projected to the world. \n The\
  \ first thing that I look for in any foreign land is cuisines to relish and satiate\
  \ my soul. Dhaka juxtaposes contemporary world cuisine with its own traditional\
  \ platter beautifully. There weren't just the big fast food chains but authentic\
  \ eateries that provided us with exquisite bites.  The Thai emerald had dumplings\
  \ that filled my heart with undeniable warmth. The Japanese cuisines served on the\
  \ second floor of this little place were equally authentic and left us craving for\
  \ more. The Thai boasted of exquisite Thai and Japanese cuisines which were a riot\
  \ of flavors in my mouth. There was a Mexican deli called El Torro that served the\
  \ best quesadillas in town. The tacos were quite perfect and the Pozole soup was\
  \ a revelation in a bowl. The Fish and Co. was another established that provided\
  \ scrumptious and luxurious food. The wide variety of fish at the buffet would satiate\
  \ any fish-lover and even the non-believers would be tempted to try it out.Bangladesh\
  \ is home to some amazing architecture. There is a rare honesty in their works which\
  \ is beautifully reflected through their designs and artistry.The liberation fire\
  \ still burns bright reminding them their blazing history and the lives sacrificed\
  \ to earn this freedom. The \"Bhasa Mancha\", Sheikh Mujibur's hose stand testimony\
  \ to the time they fought for their freedom and sovereignty.\nThe visit to Mawa\
  \ Ghat was quite an unique experience with the river giving the illusion of being\
  \ a sea, standing on one edge the other could never be seen.\nBangladesh has knitted\
  \ into the fabric of my psyche a story that is soulful and progressive, that is\
  \ different and yet similar to my own land."
