Text: "As Lisa, a backpacker friend from Ireland wound our hired Land Cruiser up to\
  \ 150km/h on the narrow bitumen track, I began to feel uneasy. We were travelling\
  \ along the mighty Gibb River Road - the entrance to the Kimberley. \n   There was\
  \ an air of excitement in our hired Land Cruiser. Pictures online and in travel\
  \ magazines were the closest any of the four of us had come to Mitchell Falls. Despite\
  \ this buzzing anticipation to see the Mitchell Plateau, I had an uncertain feeling\
  \ in the pit of my stomach. Lisa had never driven a 4X4 before, let alone driven\
  \ on Australian outback roads. She's going too fast, but not wanting to be a party\
  \ pooper, I say nothing. \n   As the bitumen turns to gravel, Lisa eases to a (still\
  \ too fast for the conditions) 120km/h. Another car is approaching and my grip tightens\
  \ a little on the seat in front of me. Sure enough a small stone is flicked onto\
  \ our windscreen, leaving a small chip. Relieved, I mention that it was a good last\
  \ minute choice to opt for the comprehensive insurance. \n   As masses of dust billow\
  \ out from behind us, Dan my fellow passenger undoes his seat belt to swivel around\
  \ with his camera for a better view. Suddenly I feel us begin to drift a little\
  \ sideways. I lean forward to warn Lisa, \u201CDon\u2019t touch the brake.\u201D\
  \ But it's too late. \n   She takes her foot off the accelerator which only serves\
  \ to exacerbate the drifting. She overcorrects left, then right. I glance at the\
  \ speedo. We're still doing 120km/hour. I instinctively scan the roadside for any\
  \ objects we might impact. The trees are dense.\n   In a strange moment of acceptance\
  \ I sit back and brace my hands against the warm metal of roof. With my eyes shut\
  \ I suddenly feel my side of the car lift, as if gravity is momentarily suspended.\
  \ Then we begin to roll. Over and over, for what feels like an eternity. The entire\
  \ time I'm bracing myself for the inevitable impact of the car against a tree. \n\
  \   The windows explode and dust fills the car. Over and over we go. And then nothing.\
  \ We're stationary and everything is silent, bar the whine of the engine, still\
  \ at full revs. I was the first to speak, \u201CIs everyone ok?\u201D\n   \u201C\
  Let's get out of here, now!\u201D I yell. Disoriented, the car filled with red dust,\
  \ there's no way of seeing which way up we had landed. I instinctively climb up\
  \ and find my way out of what was the car door window. With us now about 50 metres\
  \ from the Land Cruiser, its engine succumbed to the pressure of oil at its now\
  \ 90 degree angle and with a loud e"
