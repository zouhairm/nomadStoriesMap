Text: "With a pounding heart and sweat dripping down my back in the summer heat that\
  \ flooded the dusty adobe structure, I eyed my kidnapper with terror. I was locked\
  \ into his modest home on the outskirts of Trujillo, a knife teetering menacingly\
  \ on the table and the unmistakable odor of Peruvian Pilsen on his breath. \n\n\
  He stroked my hair and reached for my leg, his Spanish slurred. \u201CMy wife and\
  \ daughter are out of town for elections. Nobody will hear you if you cry for help.\u201D\
  \n\nHis voice began to rise with excitement as he unveiled his pre-meditated plan:\
  \ he would make me his new wife, and we would run away together. \n\nI knew my kidnapper.\
  \ I volunteered at the local medical clinic, where nuns introduced me to his family.\
  \ I danced with his extended family at birthday parties, endured flea bites at his\
  \ daughters\u2019 baptism, and hand-delivered medications to his wife. In the span\
  \ of a few months, I bonded with his 4-year-old who affectionately called me \"\
  Tia.\"\n\nMy mind drifted back to moms\u2019 words of \u201CYou can\u2019t travel\
  \ to South America alone!\u201D and Peruvian friends\u2019 warnings about the high\
  \ rates of mental illness and crime in the area. \n\nAs a \"gringita,\" I was no\
  \ stranger to precautions in the second-most dangerous city in South America. I\u2019\
  d already had a gun to my head at the gas station, witnessed a neighborhood house\
  \ being blown up by thugs, and had two Peruvian friends kidnapped in the back of\
  \ taxis in broad daylight. \n\nMy captors\u2019 intensity snapped me back to the\
  \ moment. I quickly made the decision to play along with his scheme. I knew that\
  \ if we moved into the kitchen, next to the front door, my odds of escape were higher.\
  \ \n\n\u201CProve to me that you will be a good husband. Cook for me.\u201D \n\n\
  His back to me, he began to cook arroz con huevo frito, a simple dish of white rice\
  \ and fried egg. Miraculously, the first key I snatched unlocked the dead bolt,\
  \ right as a struggle ensued. I punched, screamed and outran him in an adrenaline-fueled\
  \ frenzy. \n\nMy experience pales in comparison to what friends have been through.\
  \ Most Trujillo residents live in daily concern for safety. A common thread across\
  \ cultures and continents, the global combination of poverty and crime prevails\
  \ in epidemic proportions outside of the small bubble of westernized serenity. \n\
  \nNonetheless, I will be forever enthralled with the juxtaposition between jovial\
  \ community culture and ruggedness of life in northern Peru. \n\nKidnapping-aside,\
  \ Peruvians remain the most kind and hospitable people I have ever met."
