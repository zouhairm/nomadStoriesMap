Text: "I wondered what it would be like to be a Nigerian in the U.S. ever since I\
  \ heard that I would be participating in the ICFJ exchange program, which is also\
  \ sponsored by the bureau of education and cultural affairs.\nThe first thing that\
  \ came to my mind was: Are they trying to gather information about our country through\
  \ the program?\_ How can I ever cope with white people? Will they be friendly, nice?\
  \ Or will they talk to me about security issues in the northern part of Nigeria?\
  \ These were some of the questions that came to mind when I thought about this journey.\n\
  \nI was the first to arrive the airport in Washington, D.C. Sameen Dadfar, of the\
  \ ICFJ, was there to greet me with a smile. She says \u201CWelcome Baraka.\u201D\
  \ \_\u201CShe recognized me,\u201D I said to myself and I smiled back. Soon the\
  \ rest of the participants showed up. The Quincy hotel became our new home for the\
  \ rest of the four days of orientation.\n\nDuring our orientation, a facilitator\
  \ cautioned that Portland, Oregon is a bit cold. This is where I\u2019m headed.\
  \ This Northern Nigerian packed her African clothes and a little pair of the English\
  \ clothing and headed off to Portland. \n\nAmong the facilitators Femi Oke of Aljazeera.was\
  \ among the facilitators my role model who I aspirer to become like her, the picture\
  \ I took with her was just like a signature of her to me.\n\nMichael Clapp met me\
  \ at the airport in Portland. To my surprise, he had gotten a prayer rug for me,\
  \ in case I forgot mine. \u201CHow kind of him,\u201D I think. \_\u201CIt will be\
  \ good in here,\u201D I say to myself."
