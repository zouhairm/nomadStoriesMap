Text: "I\u2019d been in Cape Town for 10 days before we had the chance to have a proper\
  \ braai. My boyfriend, Andrew, is from Cape Town and this trip was his first time\
  \ home in some years. We spent time exploring with his friends, spending time on\
  \ the beaches and hiking Table Mountain but it wasn\u2019t until we neared the end\
  \ of the trip that I got to experience this crucial part of South African culture.\n\
  \nA braai is not a barbecue, and don\u2019t even think about suggesting as much\
  \ around any South African. It's not just a way of cooking, it\u2019s a whole experience,\
  \ from start to finish. The evening we chose was balmy, we\u2019d had wild thunderstorms\
  \ but tonight it was calm, and just cool enough to enjoy being sat fireside. \n\n\
  We arrive at Simon\u2019s house, an old friend of Andrew\u2019s & designated host.\
  \ The garden is sheltered on all sides, and a brick fire pit is built into the ground.\
  \ Around it is a mishmash of dining room furniture and various different kinds of\
  \ meats. Meat is the heart of the braai, it is its whole reason for being but it\u2019\
  s not the only thing that can be cooked this way. The  resident veggies get a sweet\
  \ potato, wrap it in tin foil and promptly shove it right into the coals. \n\nUsing\
  \ wood and charcoal to build the fire is second nature to Andrew - to them all.\
  \ Around him there is music, booze, and laughter; this is a core part of who they\
  \ are and how they connect as a group. \n\nI\u2019m surrounded by people I\u2019\
  d only met once before, but I go from being a stranger in their midst to just another\
  \ guest, peeking through the curtain from visitor to native, as much a part of the\
  \ process as anyone. \n\nThe best thing about it is that it isn\u2019t quick, it\
  \ takes real care to maintain the fire, constantly fed as it sears and grills the\
  \ meats and the rogue sweet potato. It\u2019s while all that is happening, in the\
  \ background, that the true nature of the braai comes to light. The fire connects\
  \ us, brings various different cultures together over flames and food. We stink\
  \ of the smoke, it blows in our faces and we splutter uncontrollably but it\u2019\
  s laughed off, just another part of the experience. \n\nOnly when we eat is there\
  \ silence, readily using our hands to tear at the meat. The fire carries on, until\
  \ eventually, several hours after we arrived, it\u2019s allowed to die. We have\
  \ an early flight to catch, goodbyes are shared. \n\n\u201CI have the feeling we\u2019\
  ll see you again soon,\u201D Simon says, as he releases me from a hug. It is the\
  \ nicest of send-offs, a 'so long' to the people we met, and to South Africa."
