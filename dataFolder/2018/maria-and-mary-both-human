Text: "I am not a self-proclaimed minimalist, but I travel light knowing there are\
  \ times when I will carry my luggage all day. I tend to avoid markets since I lack\
  \ the intent to purchase. But something was drawing me to take the detour to a well-known\
  \ market outside of Antigua, Guatemala. Slightly embarrassed, but grateful for its\
  \ portability, I walked through colorful Chichicastenango with my 65-liter backpack.\n\
  \nThe infinite color combinations of sunset-pinks mixed with post-dawn blues and\
  \ everywhere in between were mesmerizing. My eyes adjusted to the brightness as\
  \ I explored the market. I could see that beyond the famous Mayan colors, each shop\
  \ had its own specialty, like bags, masks or blankets. I came upon this quaint little\
  \ church where people were selling flowers on the steps outside. I recognized it\
  \ from my pre-trip research. I sat in awe thinking about how incredible I thought\
  \ the photo was at the time, and yet how little justice it did now. It is hard to\
  \ put energy into a picture, and this market was alive.\n\nA woman I had met at\
  \ one of the shops happened to be walking by. She offered to watch my backpack so\
  \ I could go inside the church. My first thought was \"stranger danger, don't trust\
  \ anyone!\" My second thought was how unfair that was to Maria. She was genuinely\
  \ nice and wasn't even trying to sell me anything. I thanked her and hesitantly\
  \ walked inside.\n\nTen minutes later, Maria was loyally protecting my bag, restoring\
  \ my faith in humanity. I was grateful and invited her to lunch. She was patient\
  \ during our slow conversation with my broken Spanish. My teachers would've been\
  \ proud, I could answer all of her questions as well as understand her responses.\
  \ She asked me what I was going to do after lunch, I casually told her that I was\
  \ going to read while waiting for my bus. She replied, \u201CI don\u2019t know how\
  \ to read.\u201D\n \nThe food arrived and I was able to ponder silently. I was stunned\
  \ and saddened. I knew that illiteracy is real, but it had always been a far away\
  \ concept because I didn't know anyone who couldn't read. Her mother took her out\
  \ of school so that she could embroider to make more money for the family. She was\
  \ working in the same market she had grown up in. And here Maria sat, cheerfully\
  \ eating, unknowingly teaching me a lesson. She loved her community and her life.\
  \ Just because it was different than mine didn't mean it was better or worse. Beyond\
  \ our education or skill sets, we are still humans capable of what matters most:\
  \ love and kindness."
