Text: "The train ride to Brighton Beach, Brooklyn took two hours from my home in Queens\u2014\
  same city, only 13 miles away, but hours\u2014and worlds\u2014apart. I walked into\
  \ the Georgian restaurant and the waiter stared at me, an Asian woman, confusedly.\
  \ I went on a cross borough pilgrimage in search of Khinkali. \n\nI first encountered\
  \ this delightful soup dumpling a year earlier in Tbilisi, Georgia. While sitting\
  \ in a lively restaurant filled with diners eager to escape the January freeze,\
  \ I took my first bite. At once the juices poured out and filled me with warmth\
  \ on a bone chilling day.  The taste was familiar\u2014similar to the soup dumplings\
  \ of my youth that I had in restaurants along the Chinatowns of New York City. Yet\
  \ there were noticeable distinctions\u2014hints of parsley and cumin instead of\
  \ green onions and soy sauce, a filling made with beef instead of pork.\n \nGeographically,\
  \ Georgia is at the crossroads of Asia and Europe, but its essence felt thoroughly\
  \ European. Cafes dotted its cobblestone streets; centuries old, Christian Orthodox\
  \ churches jutted from its mountains; and no one mirrored my Asian features. But\
  \ then there was Khinkali. As my host father proudly explained, this culinary staple\
  \ was proof that Georgia was not only physically at the crossroads of Asia and Europe\
  \ but culturally as well.\n \nBack in New York City, a place at the crossroads of\
  \ nowhere physically but everywhere culturally, I somehow felt more foreign than\
  \ I had in Tbilisi. Curious patrons eagerly tried to catch a glimpse of my order\
  \ and were happily indulged by the waiter, who presented each dish at their tables\
  \ prior to bringing it to mine. They all laughed gleefully at what the the \u201C\
  foreigner\u201D ordered. I explained over their laughter that I had visited Tbilisi\
  \ and fell in love with its culinary offerings, especially Khinkali. With this explanation,\
  \ they seemed to accept my presence, certainly not as one of their own, but at least\
  \ no longer as a curio. \n \nAll of us in that restaurant called New York City home.\
  \ But it was not our shared home that connected us; it was the love of a soup dumpling\
  \ that originated thousands of miles away. What I didn\u2019t share with them was\
  \ that our connection was perhaps deeper and even simpler than that. As I bit into\
  \ the Khinkali, I was brought back to an earlier time. Not to a year earlier in\
  \ Tbilisi, but even further. I was enveloped by the comforting reminiscence of childhood\u2014\
  a feeling that I imagine many of the patrons share when they bite into a Khinkali."
