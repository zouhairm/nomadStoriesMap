Text: "I inch my feet forward, uprooting loose rocks from mud. My heart beats with\
  \ the fervor of a tribal drum, threatening to burst out of my chest with each inhale.\
  \ The subtropical air is thick. Pearls of sweat trickle down my forehead, dampening\
  \ my hair. I am surrounded by the lime-green plumpness of a thirst-quenched forest.\
  \ Glistening leaves graze me like prying fingers as I walk. The air smells of unearthed\
  \ soil. \nI take another step. The moisture in my mouth has receded like spilled\
  \ water on hot sand. It is eerily silent, which although uncharacteristic for your\
  \ typical forest, has become commonplace in a country whose bird population has\
  \ been decimated by an invasive species of possum. \n\u201CSo, are you ready to\
  \ abseil into one of New Zealand\u2019s most famous caves?\u201D My guide, Kara\
  \ chirps excitedly. \nStepping onto the worn, wooden platform I peer over the edge\
  \ into the dark crevasse. My stomach lurches. \n \u201CI guess I\u2019m going to\
  \ have to be!\u201D I laugh nervously.\nMy brother, who had convinced me to do this,\
  \ was already waiting below. We had been road-tripping for a few weeks; hiking the\
  \ Tongariro crossing, meandering around coastal towns, always on the lookout for\
  \ geothermal pools, geysers and bubble-mud, our favorite. \nWe had come to Waitomo,\
  \ a village on the North Island to explore its labyrinth of underground caves. Waitomo,\
  \ a M\u0101ori word for, \u2018Wai\u2019 meaning water and \u2018tomo\u2019 meaning\
  \ hole, is most renowned for its underground rivers and a very curious character;\
  \ Arachnocampa luminosa, a glowworm species found exclusively in New Zealand.\n\
  However, for me to see these special creatures, I\u2019d have to get down there\
  \ first. \nKara skillfully adjusts my equipment while peppering me with instructions.\
  \ I can\u2019t focus. Wrapped around my waist and legs, my harness feels like a\
  \ chain. Every cell in my body screams at me to turn back to what is safe and predictable.\
  \  Self-doubt burrows in my brain as I calculate my descent.\n My hands are shaking.\
  \ I reluctantly grab onto my cavers-rack as instructed and slowly edge the tips\
  \ of my mud-smeared, white rubber boots out over the chasm. This is it. My breath\
  \ stops. Then, as I look down, an image of sheer resilience captivates me; emerging\
  \ from thin cracks in the limestone I spot a row of long-stemmed ferns, their necks\
  \ curling upwards as they strain to be kissed by the sun\u2019s dispersed beams.\
  \ \nI take a moment to appreciate the profoundness of growth in adversity.  \nCatapulting\
  \ my feet from the platform and into the air, I take the plunge."
