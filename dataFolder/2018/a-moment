Text: "Air screamed along the tiles, tugging at windowsills and doors. It was strangely\
  \ loud for its strength, tumbling pigeons and swirling across papers and stale bread.\
  \ Driving away the pungent smells of a tired city finally gone to bed. A city littered\
  \ with garbage almost all the way into the bins, but not quite. The homeless had\
  \ bedded down in the cement cornered riverbed, pissing in forgotten stairways, lying\
  \ underfoot but unseen beside the old city. At dawn, the bakeries with their many\
  \ pan dulces and croissants, blasted the streets with the intoxicating scent of\
  \ fresh bread. For most, though, it was still too early. Even the sun lingered,\
  \ waiting until the afternoon before at last giving its warmth to the city. \nBut\
  \ I sat, legs stretched across the pavement, sketching the empty Malagan street\
  \ while a gentle bloom of peach light rose beyond the mountains.\nI closed my eyes,\
  \ and, still exhausted from my explorations of the previous day, fell asleep.\n\
  I awoke to the sound of a motorbike tearing arrogantly down the next block, my hands\
  \ immediately cupping my bra to feel my apartment key still safely tucked away.\
  \ Something was prodding my legs, and bleary eyed I peered upward at a small boy,\
  \ edging around my outstretched limbs with a walking cane.\n \u201CExcus\xED\u201D\
  \ was all I could think to say, realising I was completely incorrect as I pulled\
  \ my legs to my chest. Then the motorbike revved nearby, snarling suddenly at the\
  \ corner and turning abruptly into my little street. It careened toward us and blared\
  \ its horn but the boy just flailed wildly, terrified and confused, and I realised\
  \ why he had a cane. \nI flew to my feet and pulled him toward me just as the bike\
  \ screamed past, the precious cane splintering beneath its wheels. \u201CLoco!!\u201D\
  \ The rider yelled, spinning around a corner. \nThe dust began to settle and I found\
  \ the boy\u2019s hand clenched tightly in mine. \u201CI\u2019m so sorry,\u201D I\
  \ mumbled, \u201CLo siento, lo siento.\u201D The boy stared toward my face, chewing\
  \ nervously at his lips. \u201CD\xF3nde esta mi bast\xF3n?\u201D My spanish was\
  \ weak but I knew he meant his cane. I felt ill. \u201CIt\u2019s broken. Roto? I\u2019\
  m so sorry.\u201D The boy closed his milky eyes. Reaching for the wall beside him,\
  \ he trailed his fingertips across the crumbling plaster and took a few tentative\
  \ steps. \u201CYou have..otra?\u201D His english wavered on his lips as he turned\
  \ back to me. \u201CYou mean a walking stick?\u201D I asked, \u201CBast\xF3n?\u201D\
  \ The boy nodded. My mind went blank. I had no idea what he could use. Then I smiled\
  \ and reached for his hand. \u201CS\xED, me.\u201D"
