Text: "It was surprising for a man of limited education and travels to be such an\
  \ effective storyteller.\n\n\u201CBhai Saab, forget about the tourists, they sometimes\
  \ kill the policemen too, who go there for investigation,\u201D said the Sardarji,\
  \ as we got down at the hill-town of Mandi. He had a sense of conviction in narrating\
  \ the crime stories of notorious tribes in this Himalayan region.\n \nFrom Mandi,\
  \ I took another bus to the mountain top where Lake Prashar sat like a bowl, with\
  \ a perfectly round, floating island in it! Besides the lake, was a temple and a\
  \ tea-selling shanty. Mesmerized by the mystic beauty of the lake, I climbed up\
  \ and down the surrounding hillocks to admire and capture its beauty from every\
  \ angle. By the time I came back, the bus had already left.\n\n\u201CNearest village\
  \ to catch another bus is a six kilometers trek, but I\u2019m sure you will get\
  \ lost in the jungle,\u201D said the tea-seller. It was getting dark and I had no\
  \ other option.\n\nDescending the steep trails, for about twenty minutes, the skies\
  \ opened up unexpectedly. Stranded amidst the heavy downpour coupled with the frightening\
  \ sounds of jungle, it struck me that I was fully exposed to the perils of nature.\
  \ I paused to take a look around. And to my relief, there was a house at a distance.\n\
  \n\u201CWait, we have a spare room outside,\u201D said the scrawny owner of the\
  \ house with long, unkempt hair and beard. He opened the spare room and left without\
  \ saying anything. Enveloped in darkness, and lying under a quilt, I suddenly recalled\
  \ the Sardarji\u2019s stories and a chill went down my spine. Could this man be\
  \ from one of those tribes?\n\nSound of the rain falling on the tin-roof was compounding\
  \ my fear.  As the lightning flashed, I saw a creepy figure outside the window.\
  \ Petrified, I began imagining the worst and started praying feverishly.\n\nCollective\
  \ chirping of the birds woke me up. The light of the pleasant morning had replaced\
  \ the darkness. I opened the door and it was one of the most breath-taking mornings\
  \ I had ever woken up to. The rejuvenated look of the valley and the sky from the\
  \ previous night\u2019s shower had an invigorating effect on me.\n\nResuming my\
  \ trek, I thought \u2013 the fear of the dusk, sometimes, turns out to be the beauty\
  \ of the dawn. And how, as in life, even the most beautiful thing, when looked through\
  \ the glass of fear, may appear dreadful.\n\nThe creepy figure outside the window\
  \ was actually a beautiful Alder tree swaying in the mountain breeze."
