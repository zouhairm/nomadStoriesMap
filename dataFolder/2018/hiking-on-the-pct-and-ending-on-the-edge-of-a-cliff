Text: "It was during summer 2016, I just finished highschool, I was 18, and went to\
  \ the USA, to hike a part of the Pacific Crest Trail, in Oregon and Washington.\
  \ It was my first hiking trip that I had organise all alone and did alone, so I\
  \ did a lot of mistakes: I didn't had good socks, so my feet were covered with blisters,\
  \ my backpack was way to heavy, and after a few weeks, my body was painful. But\
  \ it never stopped me, and in 6 weeks, I slowly hiked 385 miles. Each morning, after\
  \ fifteen, twenty minutes, I started to love it again, hiking in the woods, drinking\
  \ waters from the rivers, enjoying the sun and the nature, sleeping in my tent.\n\
  At one point, the trail was splitting in two options. I could hike at the bottom\
  \ of the mountains and enjoying the lakes, or hike at the top of the mountain and\
  \ enjoying the view. Sure, the second option was more attractive, but with less\
  \ water then on the first one. I didn't had a filter and had to boil my water before\
  \ drinking it, so to be safe, I choose the first option. It was a part of the trail\
  \ that almost nobody use, everybody choosing to hike on the top of the mountains.\
  \ Because of the wildfires that happened the last years, a lot of dead trees where\
  \ laying on the trail. Really a lot. After a few miles I had to climb over them\
  \ each 30 yards, and it was exhausting. I looked quickly on the map to see how many\
  \ miles I had for that day. I saw that the trail was doing a \"U\" around the mountain,\
  \ so stupidly but full of hope to find a shortcut, I decided to cross that \"U\"\
  \ in the middle, and to hike straight on the other side of the mountain. I just\
  \ needed my compass, it was going straight north. \nSo I started to climb that mountain.\
  \ But there were a lot of thing that I didn't expected: the mountain was like huge,\
  \ gigantic stairs. I from where I was and because of how steep it was, I never saw\
  \ the next stair. I always had the feeling that it was the end, that I was arriving\
  \ at the top, but no. Finally, it took me a few hours more than what was planned.\
  \ \nBut the big surprise was waiting for me up there. Because, yes, the mountain\
  \ was steepy on the side I climbed, but on the other side, it was just a cliff.\
  \ From where I was, I could see everything around me, miles and miles away. I could\
  \ even see my trail that I to join way down under myself. Finally, after one hour\
  \ walking along the cliff, I saw a little path marked by animals going down the\
  \ mountain. I almost falled a few times, but I'm proud to say that I am still alive."
