Text: "The last thing I expected was to hear voices in a graveyard.\n\nLiterally underfoot\
  \ arose a sonorous shout from antiquity; gunfire clanging, warriors hollering, missionaries\
  \ murmuring, and all it took was a gentle churchyard stroll. \n\nIn picturesque\
  \ Russell in New Zealand sits Christ Church, the oldest in the country built in\
  \ 1836. Russell was then known as Kororareka, the largest whaling port in the Southern\
  \ Hemisphere renowned for profligate sailors, traders, grog shops and brothels.\
  \ Despite the strenuous efforts of pious missionaries, it was the Hell-Hole of the\
  \ Pacific, \n\nOfficers from HMS Beagle and a Mr Charles Darwin were initial church\
  \ fund raisers. In fact, Darwin is said to have been one the first Englishman to\
  \ play cricket across the bay.\n \nThe inaugural service was conducted in January\
  \ 1836, by William Williams. In 1840 he became the principal translator of the Treaty\
  \ of Waitangi between Maori and the Crown, the only treaty the British ever signed\
  \ during their expansionist Victorian colonial era.  \n\nOn a hot summer\u2019s\
  \ day that year, from these church grounds, an over-dressed William Hobson delivered\
  \ three proclamations to local Maori and English settlers. First, Australia\u2019\
  s New South Wales boundaries would be extended to include New Zealand.  He set out\
  \ details of English-style land transactions (utterly foreign to Polynesian concepts\
  \ of communal land ownership) and, yes, he would be Lieutenant Governor. It didn\u2019\
  t augur well.\n\nBy 1845 Chief Hone Heke had symbolically chopped down the British\
  \ flagpole four raucous times, frustrated that treaty values were not being adhered\
  \ to. When the British built a blockhouse in response, Hone cried enough (katirawhe!)\
  \ and attacked Kororareka.  \n\nHMS Hazard landed sailors as American ship USS St\
  \ Louis evacuated British subjects. The defender\u2019s ammunition was destroyed\
  \ and a subsequent explosion razed the entire town as two stray musket shots hit\
  \ the church wall. The holes are still there. Six Hazard men died in battle and\
  \ are buried in the graveyard. \n \nThe first cemetery \u2018guest\u2019 was a grog-seller\
  \ and escaped Australian convict. Others include the second white woman born in\
  \ New Zealand and the country\u2019s first surgeon and his six children. There\u2019\
  s a prominent headstone to Maori leader, Tamati Waka Nene, and a smaller memorial\
  \ to Samuel Stephenson, whose descendant is married to Scottish comedian, Sir Billy\
  \ Connolly.  These are some of many.\n\nSo, stop, look and listen in Russell. History\u2019\
  s homilies are audible."
