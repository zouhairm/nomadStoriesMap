Text: "\xABTe estaba buscando, por la calle gritando, eso me est\xE1 matando, oh no\xBB\
  \ sings the radio in the old school bus that drops me off in Portobelo, a small\
  \ seaside village in Panama. As I disembark, I am amused by the colorful paintings\
  \ and phrases written on the rusty passenger side door: \xABHoy sali con Dios. Si\
  \ no regreso es que me fui con el\xBB, \xABToday I went out with God, if I don\u2019\
  t come back, it\u2019s because I left with him\xBB.\n\nI am finally in the Caribbean.\
  \ As I inhale the humid air and look at the cloud-filled sky \u2013 it will probably\
  \ rain today -  I remember the warnings of my fellow travelers: \xABit\u2019s difficult\
  \ to find that kind of job when you have no experience\xBB, \xABit\u2019s not the\
  \ season\xBB, \xABwhat will you do if you were to get sick?\xBB.\n\nUndeterred,\
  \ I walk along the shore with my heavy backpack. I admire the calm water of the\
  \ bay, and think: \xABWho cares? At least I can say I tried.\xBB\nI stop and ask\
  \ someone where I can find Captain Jack\u2019s, the hostel-bar where I heard many\
  \ boat captains come to have a beer before taking the \xABroad\xBB back. Back to\
  \ the San Blas islands, an archipelago with small white sand islands, coconut palms,\
  \ coral reefs and colorful fish. My objective was clear: I would work on a sailing\
  \ boat in this heaven.\n\nI spent three days at Captain Jack\u2019s, checking ads\
  \ and asking around in hopes of finding someone who just might know someone...\n\
  \nThree relaxed days. But I gave myself only five days to try before moving on to\
  \ Colombia. The rice and beans is not the best here and I won\u2019t be able to\
  \ stomach it for much longer.\n\nI wake up on the fourth morning and plan; today,\
  \ I will do everything I can. I will go to that pier where the captains leave their\
  \ small boats. I will try anything, talk to anyone. I can see the rain falling through\
  \ the window but it is still around 90\xB0F and I am determined.\n\nLeaving my room,\
  \ I spot two guys already drinking at the bar (it\u2019s 10 am). I eavesdrop on\
  \ their conversation, they are both captains. I confidently approach them: \xAB\
  Sorry to interrupt you, but I was wondering if you could give me some advice \xBB\
  .\n\nFor the rest of the hour, I listen carefully as Jo\xE3o and Pablo explain the\
  \ in\u2019s and out\u2019s of working on a boat and what I should do to find a job.\
  \ \nThen Jo\xE3o interrupts himself, he just received a text message.\nHe looks\
  \ up and asks, \u201CWould you be able to leave now?\xBB\n\nI nearly shouted \u201C\
  yes!\u201D I packed all my things in five minutes and left without saying goodbye\
  \ to work on a catamaran for two weeks in the heavenly San Blas islands."
