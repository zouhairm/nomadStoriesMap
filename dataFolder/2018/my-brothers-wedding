Text: "It was a plan we anticipated for the coming year! My brothers wedding! it was\
  \ a big trip for the family, especially my parents as we embarked on a journey across\
  \ the world to see my brother get married. He met a South African, and moved to\
  \ South Africa a couple years back. 10 years later he decided to make his girlfriend\
  \ his wife! we adored the thought but the distance of brotherly love tore me apart,\
  \ knowing how far I would have to travel each time I would want to see him. You\
  \ see, we are Canadian's, loyal, nice and accommodating people at the end of the\
  \ day. So I celebrated his love for his soon to be wife with my family and we started\
  \ to plan the trip of a lifetime to see my brother get married. The set date was\
  \ a couple months down the road, so there was tons of planning and excitement, however\
  \ my professional career and my boyfriends professional life was at a stand still\
  \ because of the time Frame we gave ourself to go on this trip. luckily I was self-\
  \ employed and my boyfriend job was very flexible so we decided to plan a month\
  \ get away to Cape Town (my brothers destination wedding) and enjoy our time together\
  \ for a whole month before my brothers actual wedding, just my boyfriend and myself,\
  \ little did I know I would come back to Canada as his fiancee.\n It was three days\
  \ after my brother got married, and instead of the typical honeymoon thing couples\
  \ do after people they get married, they decided to rent a house and spend time\
  \ with his family and her family, planning out day trips, hiking trails, camping,\
  \ mounting climbing and wine tours. South Africans love their meat and love to brai!\
  \  However I am not much of a meat eater, but on one of these days I decided to\
  \ wish all my devotions away and eat all the meat I wanted to! and man did I pay\
  \ the price the next day! it was a Wednesday and there was a wine tour planned out\
  \ for the families, I love wine and was considering staying home because of the\
  \ \"meat sweats\" but this once in a life time wine tour could not be missed! so\
  \ I put a brave face on and went! there was this odd sensation I was getting from\
  \ everyone, suddenly everyone knew I was not feeling well! weird, I thought... why\
  \ do they care so much?  then  it suddenly dawned on me once we got to the basement\
  \ of the wine cellar, my family left abruptly down a tunnel and there was my boyfriend\
  \ standing in front of me, bending down on one knee... Im sure you can guess the\
  \ next words out of his mouth... it was the last thing I expected"
