Text: "The metro leaves Marienplatz station at 3.17 p.m. Right on time. Why am I surprised?\
  \ Public transport in Germany is like clockwork; one could time their watches with\
  \ it.\n\nI take the U-Bahn all the way to Olympiapark, a huge ground built especially\
  \ for the 1972 Olympics. Today, this is the venue for Tollwood, a festival organized\
  \ every year in summers and winters for about a month each. As I walk towards the\
  \ venue, my head fills with images of fairs that I\u2019ve grown up attending back\
  \ home in Delhi- games, candies and an indispensable giant wheel. Suddenly I\u2019\
  m jolted back to reality and my senses are heightened: loud music, air infused with\
  \ the sweet smell of butter and sugar, and an energy that is palpable even from\
  \ a distance.\n\nHere age is no bar, and the child in me couldn\u2019t be happier.\
  \ I meet a friend at the entrance, and we step into the funfair. Hopping from one\
  \ event to the other, we gorge on pretzels and make sure we have a constant supply\
  \ of Spezi to quench our thirst.\n\nThrough the evening, our eyes search for the\
  \ perfect souvenir. Suddenly, my friend catches sight of a cubicle sized stall which\
  \ has beautiful handiwork on display. They are all dedicated to the religion of\
  \ Islam. All the pieces are hand made and intricately carved on wood of different\
  \ shapes and sizes. The owner, a plump old man, quietly works on another one of\
  \ his masterpieces.\n\nMy friend, being a Muslim herself, is fascinated with one\
  \ of the pieces. But they are expensive. Not surprisingly, a bargaining battle begins\
  \ (more like a friendly exchange actually, unlike what I\u2019m used to seeing back\
  \ home).\n\n\u201CAs-Salam-Alaikum! How much is this for?\u201D, she asks, pointing\
  \ to a Quran verse that her eyes are fixated on.\n\u201CWa-Alaikum-Salam! EUR 130,\
  \ please\u201D.\n\nIt\u2019s pricey, she says. It\u2019s hand made, he justifies.\
  \ Both attempt to convince each other. Regardless, when two strangers meet in a\
  \ foreign land, any common ground can be a uniting factor. Co-incidentally, Ramadan\
  \ started a few days earlier.\n\n\u201CAre you keeping Ramadan?\u201D, asks the\
  \ old man.\n\u201CIt\u2019s a little difficult as I\u2019m away from home. But yes,\
  \ I am\u201D, she replies.\n\u201CYes, I understand. What about you, Fr\xE4ulein?\u201D\
  , he asks me.\n\u201COh, no. I am a Hindu\u201D, I answer in all innocence, not\
  \ wanting to be misunderstood.\n\n\u201CAh! But we\u2019re all people.\u201D\n\n\
  A casual statement, upholding all that religion stands for. A simple truth, unfortunately\
  \ not clearly understood by many in this world. And all it took was a Muslim wood\
  \ carver in Germany to state the obvious."
