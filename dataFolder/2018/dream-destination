Text: "Traveling is a magic with open eyes... Talking abt Maldives  I can say heaven\
  \ of Earth.. and one of most lonely planet.. imagine waking up and experienced blue\
  \ color of water, the exact color of a rare Ceylon topaz. Sunshine hits the gin-clear\
  \ water and dances geometrically on the sandy floor around feet and coral green\
  \ bushes Spend time in the capital: Before going off on your water excursions, get\
  \ to know the country a little. Stay in Mal\xE9 for a few nights, visit the mosques\
  \ and the local coffee shops, the produce market and the main harbour.\n\nVisit\
  \ a picnic island: Spend a day on a picnic island, where there are no places to\
  \ stay, but barbecue pits line the beaches, small catering companies arrange lunch,\
  \ and snorkelling is possible less than ten feet from the shore.\n\nStay a night\
  \ on an uninhabited island: A few of Maldives\u2019 1,190 islands are still unpeopled.\
  \ You can charter a dhoni (local Maldivian boat) and visit one, catch fish from\
  \ the boat at night, cook it on a wood fire, and eat and sleep under the stars,\
  \ Robinson Crusoe style.\n\nGo on a snorkelling tour: Snorkelling is one of the\
  \ most popular activities in the Maldives. Every guest house and resort offers snorkelling\
  \ trip with some off the beach, while others take you mid-ocean, right above gorgeous\
  \ barrier reefs.\n\nDive into the Indian Ocean: Maldives boasts some of the best\
  \ dive sites in the world. Take your pick from easy to advanced dives that can be\
  \ done from a large number of islands or safari ships and liveaboards.\n\nTry the\
  \ local food:Maldivian food is becoming increasingly hard to find in the country,\
  \ with restaurants serving mostly international cuisines. So go to the local eateries\
  \ and coffee houses instead and sample some mashuni, kulhi mas, curries and the\
  \ various local snacks.\n\nTraveling should always give an never forgetting memories"
