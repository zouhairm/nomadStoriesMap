Text: "I thought that Johan was joking when he said that we were going to bike home\
  \ in the snow.\n\n\u2018You haven\u2019t properly moved to Denmark until you have\
  \ biked after a blizzard.\u2019\n\nI stare at him incredulously as he gets on his\
  \ bike until I realise that he\u2019s serious. I get on my own bike, gripping the\
  \ handles. My fingers are frozen even through my thick woollen gloves. We begin\
  \ cycling slowly out of the main square, the wind hitting my uncovered face like\
  \ an ice-cold slap. \n\nI glance through some caf\xE9 windows. Some people are wrapped\
  \ up in blankets, whispering to each other over lit candles or are completely engrossed\
  \ in novels. There is a Danish term, hygge, that emphasises a sense of cosy contentment\
  \ and wellbeing through simple acts. The importance of achieving hygge \u2013 this\
  \ sense of cosiness \u2013 is even more apparent in winter. For being some of the\
  \ happiest people on earth, the Danes must be doing something right. \n\nWe cycle\
  \ past Christmas markets that are set up all over the city. Only hours ago, the\
  \ stalls were selling wooden trinkets, delicious pastries and gl\xF8gg \u2013 the\
  \ Danish mulled wine. We continue to cycle past the colourful facades of Copenhagen,\
  \ set up like Lego blocks. The powdery snow sprinkled on vibrant and elegant buildings\
  \ further evokes the sensation that I am living in a fairy-tale city. \n\nWe finally\
  \ reach Evyn\u2019s apartment, peeling off our layers. Six of our friends have finished\
  \ cooking tonight\u2019s dinner. We put on some music that reminds us of the festival\
  \ we went to the previous summer and share some bottles of beer. After dinner, we\
  \ sit on various couches and comfortable bits of carpet with the lights dimmed,\
  \ making my eyes droop. I am too full to contribute to the conversation, so I simply\
  \ listen to my friends as they reminisce about various festivals, nights out and\
  \ weekend trips that we have been on this year. \n\nThen it starts to dawn on me.\
  \ This is why I have been told that hygge is untranslatable \u2013 it is a feeling,\
  \ something that cannot easily be put into words. I am completely cosy in a room\
  \ filled with my closest friends, living in a dazzling winter wonderland. A sense\
  \ of ease washes over me. This is exactly where I am meant to be. I was anxious\
  \ about leaving my home to move to Copenhagen, but I\u2019m not sure where my home\
  \ is anymore. Maybe \u2018home\u2019 is wherever my soul feels content. Wherever\
  \ my soul is fed with friendship, adventure and hygge is where I will leave pieces\
  \ of my heart. This is why I think I will never stop travelling."
