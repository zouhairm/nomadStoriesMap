Text: "I was told that the Temple was one of a kind! A place so spectacular and vibrant\
  \ that any amount of words would demean the beauty. Kamakhya is a sacred Hindu temple\
  \ built in the prehistoric century. It\u2019s not just a famous pilgrimage site,\
  \ but also a unique combination of historic architecture and colours. After two\
  \ hours of drive I reached the base of the temple and stepped out of the car, the\
  \ distant chants and bells came gushing into my ears. The air was filled with incense\
  \ smell. People dressed up neat and holding offerings at their hands. Everyone walking\
  \ to the same direction, wanting money, health, but above all, happiness. Shoes\
  \ being banned inside, I was bare feet. Entered the footpath leading to the temple\
  \ faithfully and had just taken the first step when I found out I was looking at\
  \ two lines of unending stalls selling hundreds of goods all the way. This single\
  \ street at the temple\u2019s base was the epicenter, whose stalls offered cheap\
  \ plastic trinkets, small sculptures of god and everything else that clashed with\
  \ the religious fervor of pilgrims. Further, those vendors were the most efficient\
  \ sellers I have ever encountered. One had to marvel how they came at you, exclaiming\
  \ that the items they sold are the ones needed by the temple goddess. They spoke\
  \ with the softest voice. Tactics, charge an exorbitant amount at first and after\
  \ a bargain, give those items for half the price still making a profit. With aching\
  \ knees and filthy feet I emerged from the endless street into a brilliant gate.\
  \ The chimes and hymns were the loudest and I was looking at the magnificent temple\
  \ created as a grandeur structural existence surreal to human eyes. The stone carvings,\
  \ floor and everything else was built by the hands of prehistoric people. The place\
  \ felt so natural in itself, and without shoes, it was generating a strange connection\
  \ with myself. I walked through all the corners avoiding people and ducking their\
  \ selfies. They were waging war and I was dodging picture bullets! The overwhelming\
  \ feeling of not caring about others, was gushing in and out. I finished the temple\
  \ tour and was ready for the vendors during my descent. Suddenly, no one wanted\
  \ to sell me their items. I had achieved the so called insignificance and it is\
  \ this moment when I found out how happy I was. Maybe this is what we are to achieve\
  \ in life. Lesson, roaming different places certainly doesn\u2019t find you answers\
  \ but it generates a connection with self. Also don\u2019t buy cheap stuff on the\
  \ way!"
