Text: "It is a truth not quite universally acknowledged, that an embassy in possession\
  \ of adequate visas, must be in want of some strange characters. I had spent the\
  \ past three hours pondering the fact as a crisp Andean breeze destroyed the ponytail\
  \ I had somehow coaxed into a scrunchie. \n\nI wondered about the people who were\
  \ still waiting to get in: the curious man in a three-piece business suit, the frazzled\
  \ mother whose four children were taking turns hopping into the fountain as she\
  \ corralled the rest, a young woman with bright purple hair who was furiously scribbling\
  \ in a bright red notebook. I wondered about their stories and what compelled them\
  \ to embark on this new adventure to a strange land where they might not even know\
  \ the language. \n\nAs I wondered about the story of the man in the straw hat who\
  \ was clutching a weathered photograph and wiping away tears, Alex shook my shoulder.\n\
  \n\u201CIt\u2019s him!\u201D \n\n\u201CWho?\u201D \n\nMy blank face launched a lecture\
  \ on batting averages, strikeouts, and a barrage of other sports terms I assumed\
  \ were baseball-related. The conclusion involved \u201CFlorida Starfish\u201D Or\
  \ maybe it was Marlins? I am also clueless about sea creatures. \n\n\u201CGet his\
  \ autograph for me!\u201D I blinked at him, wondering if he knew me at all but his\
  \ pleading eyes got to me. I took the paper and pen and walked over. \n\n\u201C\
  Excuse me,\u201D I squeaked. He looked up at me and I couldn\u2019t remember the\
  \ Spanish word for autograph. I held up the notebook instead and he nodded. \n\n\
  \u201C\xBFTu nombre?\u201D\n\n\u201CAlexander.\u201D \n\n\u201CAlexander?\u201D\
  \ \n\nAnd then I found myself cursed with babbling fever. It made me say things\
  \ like \u201CHe wants your autograph. I don\u2019t because I don\u2019t know you.\u201D\
  \ It was not the speech I had practiced. I hoped the embassy had trapdoors that\
  \ could swallow me up. \nDespite my accidental dolphin imitation, he was gracious\
  \ gave me the autograph. \nI walked back to Alexander, blushing like a blond tomato,\
  \ and then wondered if I should have gotten an autograph too. I was too humiliated\
  \ to attempt a second Starfish encounter but Alex dragged me back. My shy friend\
  \ disappeared into a flow of beautiful Bogotano Spanish who eventually motioned\
  \ to me. \n\nGracious again, Starfish reached for the pen, stoic gaze firmly in\
  \ place. As we walked away, I glanced back and saw him chuckle and shake his head.\
  \ \nI returned to my seat and once again thought about that truth universally acknowledged,\
  \ smiling at the realization that I happened to be one of those strange characters."
