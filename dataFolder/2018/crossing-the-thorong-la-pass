Text: "2:00AM and April cold envelops me at the 4,540m Thorong Phedi basecamp in Nepal.\
  \ The darkness in my room is absolute. I stumble to my clothes and quickly dress,\
  \ putting five layers on my upper body. Outside, I am greeted by the weaving headlamps\
  \ of about a dozen trekkers, who chatter with excitement as they wander around preparing.\
  \ Early starts are crucial if you want to cross the 5,416m Thorong La Pass before\
  \ the severe winds arrive. I find my guide, a jovial and stocky Nepali of sixty.\
  \ His English is limited, but sufficient. \u201CToday we go a little up, then a\
  \ little down, then up, up, up\u201D he often says. Well, after eight days of up,\
  \ up, up, this is it, the final ascent before the downhill phase of the Annapurna\
  \ Circuit. The timing is fortunate, as the uphill trekking has caused the thumbnail\
  \ sized blisters on my heels to burst. The downhill sections will ease the pain.\
  \ We head out at 2:45AM, with about thirty headlamps scattered across the black\
  \ mountain above us. The initial ascent is brutally steep. I am hunched over, staring\
  \ at the ground, my light shining on my boots. My lungs and legs burn, scream, beg.\
  \ Still, we manage to pass a few even more distressed trekkers. After an hour it\u2019\
  s time for a break at Thorong High Camp, which at 4,880m is the last stop before\
  \ the pass. Trekkers stay here to further acclimatize or to shorten the final climb.\
  \ We are now trekking in old snow, perhaps 15cm, and fresh snow is falling. As we\
  \ gain elevation, the wind increases, blowing the snow almost horizontally. It stings\
  \ my face and I squint. I see three people, backtracking slowly. It\u2019s a couple\
  \ with a young boy. \u201CHe has altitude sickness\u201D they say as they pass,\
  \ \u201Cso we\u2019re heading down.\u201D No one else talks and the crunch of feet\
  \ on snow, coupled with wind, is all I hear. Finally, we begin to flatten out, which\
  \ means the pass is close. Through the blizzard I can see a building. It\u2019s\
  \ the teahouse, where warmth and rest are waiting. After about four hours, I\u2019\
  m not really walking. It\u2019s a trudge, a slow shuffle. My guide, as always, bounces\
  \ along, cheerful and immune. At last we reach the teahouse, where a sign adorned\
  \ with fluttering, colored prayer flags welcomes and congratulates us. The teahouse\
  \ is small, crowded, and I sense no one wants back into the snow and wind to make\
  \ the trek down to Muktinath at 3,710m. Exhaustion is everywhere. My guide and I\
  \ finish our tea, tentatively leave, and begin our descent to the hot shower and\
  \ cold beer that are calling out my name."
