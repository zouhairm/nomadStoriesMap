Text: "The angles and points, along with the sun reflecting off the glass exterior,\
  \ makes the building seem like an abstract art sculpture and gives the impression\
  \ of an iceberg reaching upward, a comparison fitting for the Belfast Titanic Experience.\n\
  \nAdmittedly, my knowledge of the Titanic was minimal; while on its first voyage\
  \ across the Atlantic Ocean, the \u201Cunsinkable\u201D luxury cruise liner, hit\
  \ an iceberg and sank. While a devastating event, it hadn\u2019t started or ended\
  \ a war, hadn\u2019t really changed the course of history in any way. How was it\
  \ enough to create a tourist destination? \n\nExperience is an accurate description.\
  \ In addition to the history of the industry and culture of Belfast at the time,\
  \ there are blueprints and models of the ship and an amusement park type ride that\
  \ takes you through a replica of the shipyard, narrated from the point of view of\
  \ ironworkers and others who helped create the massive vessel. \n\nIt\u2019s not,\
  \ however, only an industrial, constructionist representation. It also takes you\
  \ through the voyage itself. A 180\xB0 video experience takes you from the bottom\
  \ to the top of the ship, showing the differences, level by level, in where each\
  \ class was allowed, ending on the topmost deck. This is so well done, I could feel\
  \ the sway of the ship as I stood on solid ground, surrounded by other visitors.\
  \ Recreated state rooms are further representation of the difference in the onboard\
  \ experience of each class. These are complete with hologram crew members who explain\
  \ how many people would have been in each cabin and the difference in the meals\
  \ offered for each class. \n\nYet, with all of the impressive technology throughout,\
  \ I was surprised to find the part that stayed with me was a space that was nothing\
  \ fancy, a group of chairs against the wall and a few pictures. The voices in that\
  \ space don\u2019t come from holograms or videos. They are simple voice recordings\
  \ of survivors. Some describe the people, some the fear they felt, while others\
  \ talk about the sounds of the night. Many talk about how the music continued to\
  \ play and how, despite the snow and ice that covered the deck, the crew members\
  \ continued to reassure everyone they had no need to worry.\n\nI went into the building\
  \ wondering how, a story I thought of as just a tragic shipwreck, had created a\
  \ tourist destination. I left hearing the echo of the survivors\u2019 voices, knowing\
  \ that even though it didn\u2019t start or end a war, it had certainly changed the\
  \ course of their history."
