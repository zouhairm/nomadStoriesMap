  Great. A shaman is coming, Mu says to come. They\u2019re going to sacrifice a pig.\u201D\
  \nTwo years ago, I did a homestay with Mu, a Black Hmong trekking gide. Since then,\
  \ I have visited many times, developing a friendship with her family. Becca is a\
  \ textiles fanatic, so she is staying with Mu to learn the traditional methods still\
  \ used to make their clothing. Both men and women wear embroidered, long sleeve\
  \ jackets made from hemp and indigo they grow themselves. \nWhen I arrive, Mu\u2019\
  s oldest son, Cha, is playing outside. I put my bag down and Mu\u2019s daughter,\
  \ Su, launches into my arms. Chang, the youngest, is sitting by the fire, transfixed\
  \ by their new smartphone. I produce a bag of colored pencils, and all three children\
  \ begin coloring by the fire. I notice that princess have replaced the traditional\
  \ Hmong girls in Su\u2019s drawings.\nBecca roused herself from bed. \u201CThe men\
  \ were chopping wood till 10, then we drank,\u201D she explained with a look on\
  \ her face you only get after a night of drinking with the Hmong.  \nBecca and I\
  \ joined Mu\u2019s sister-in-law, Zi, on a trek with her customers. We met women\
  \ completing embroidery for their new jackets in time for the New Year, their fingers\
  \ stained with synthetic dyes now used for embroidery thread. We pass Cha\u2019\
  s school. Mu and Zi speak 3 languages, but are ilitterate. Their children are the\
  \ first to go to school. As we climb the slippary rice terraces back, livestock\
  \ graze on the remains of the rice harvest. After dinner, Mu\u2019s family watches\
  \ a US Hmong TV show, and I see the princesses from Su\u2019s picture.\nThe Shaman\
  \ arrived early the next morning and began chanting in a language no one understood\
  \ at the alter. The ceremony went on for 6 hours with several rounds chanting, singing,\
  \ and fortune telling with buffalo horns. A piglet was held down on ceremonial paper,\
  \ squealing as the shaman chanted over it. This is going to make me go vegan,I think.\
  \ Then it is taken into the kitchen and a knife is undramatically slipped into the\
  \ pig\u2019s throat. After preparing the body for cooking, it is returned to the\
  \ paper for more chanting. Two chickens are also sacrificed, and I didn\u2019t go\
  \ vegan.\nAt night, we feast on the sacrifices and drink \u201Chappy water\u201D\
  \ with honey from their beehive. Having already learned my lesson, I go to bed before\
  \ I\u2019m too drunk. It\u2019s impossible to refuse rice wine from the Hmong. \n\
  At 6am the next morning I awake to the sound of the shaman perfoming another ceremony\
  \ next door."
