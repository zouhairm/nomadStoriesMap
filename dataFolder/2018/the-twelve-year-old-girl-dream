Text: "Imagine you are a twelve-year-old girl, full of hope and expectations about\
  \ what you will be or do in the future. Your heart burns to know a new world and\
  \ taste the most delicious sensation that is traveling and living an adventure.\
  \ A dream was born and a beautiful tomorrow was about to give birth. \nThis little\
  \ twelve-years-old girl was me and I still have this burning heart beating for an\
  \ adventure.  Since I was younger, I dreamed to study abroad. I wanted to expand\
  \ my knowledge and, at the same time, extend my view of the world. I was hungry\
  \ for living a life that would worth living.\nWhen I was twenty-one years old I\
  \ entered a college next to my house. I always saw myself walking through those\
  \ doors. My future was traced. A plan was made: Getting a scholarship to study abroad.\
  \ I knew that university had international scholarship programs. I gave the best\
  \ of me. I studied a lot and, as a result, I got a scholarship to study in Australia.\
  \ I could not be happier. I instantly remembered the \u201Ctwelve-year-old Ana\u201D\
  \ that used to spend hours in her room imagining the moment that a dream would come\
  \ true. \nAt that moment, my only concerns were packing my things, buying flight\
  \ tickets and never stopping smiling. Fortunately, I got all things packed, especially\
  \ my adventurous spirit and will for learning. I bought my flight tickets to the\
  \ \u201Cdreamland\u201D and my smile remains on my face together with my bright\
  \ eyes. I never felt so brilliant and radiant. However, it was just the beginning.\
  \ Thank God. \nThe first time I stepped Australian\u2019s ground, I felt my blood\
  \ running in the veins and getting hotter and hotter. I closed my eyes, took a deep\
  \ breath and, when I opened my eyes again, I was on the clouds. I walked on Australian\u2019\
  s airport floor as I was walking in the heaven meeting the angels.  I was ready\
  \ to seize every opportunity to learn more and get involved with the culture of\
  \ Australia.\nHowever, beyond of all things I expected, I have gained more than\
  \ I imagined. I expected learning more about my subject at college. I ended up learning\
  \ more about how to be a better person. I pictured myself attending classes to get\
  \ knowledge. Nevertheless, I also \u201Cattended\u201D classes on streets and social\
  \ spaces learning how to get involved with local people, enjoying their talk. \n\
  In conclusion, the last thing I expected was learning about love. I have learned\
  \ about being more patient, kind and open-minded. I understood the real meaning\
  \ of loving people and being loved. And it changed everything."
