Text: "We got to Rangi Saba the night before the harambee. We were told that\u2019\
  s Swahili for seven colors. Harambee, we were told, means \u201Clet us all pull\
  \ together.\" The post-independence motto is also what they call fundraisers. Everyone\
  \ comes together to support a cause. This harambee was for the primary school named\
  \ for my friend. I never knew that until I saw her name painted across the gates.\
  \ I smiled, quietly appreciating her humility. So many donors and nonprofits had\
  \ matched money raised by this community high atop the escarpment. And I was finally\
  \ going to see the school with running water. \n\nThe women sat squarely in the\
  \ sun on the dry hillside without even spots of shade from the acacia trees. We\
  \ were escorted around the perimeter and seated in plastic lawn chairs with the\
  \ men under a canvas canopy. The students danced and sang. They wore their school\
  \ uniforms, American sneakers and Maasai beaded necklaces tiered and stacked around\
  \ their necks. The boys jumped as high and straight into the air as they could.\
  \ After the performances the fathers lined up first to donate. Then the mothers.\
  \ Then the guests. The whole community would pull together to donate money for the\
  \ next classroom. \n\nMany of the 109 students walk 13 kilometers to attend school\
  \ here. We meet with the school board afterward in the classroom with the broken\
  \ window. They passed around large bowls of lamb meat and talked about the upcoming\
  \ national exams and about Diana, the girl who was, again, getting the highest grades.\
  \ After all the scholarships had been discussed it was finally time to go to the\
  \ well. It had yet to draw any water.\n\nWe walked down the hillside to a 300-meter-deep\
  \ borehole. A church group had donated a generator to operate the well and run water\
  \ to wide basin sinks closer to the school. But it wasn\u2019t nearly powerful enough\
  \ to pull water up from that depth. It sat, unused in a pumphouse a few yards away.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThat,\u201D the director, my friend\u2019s Kenyan counterpart, told\
  \ me, \u201Cis the gift of the pregnant cat.\u201D I cocked my head to the side,\
  \ waited for his explanation. \u201CWe so appreciate the generosity offered to this\
  \ community,\u201D he continued, \u201CThese are gifts from the heart. But if the\
  \ people cannot use what they are given without raising more money to buy more things\
  \ ...\u201D\n\nThe sinks remain dry and the women and children still hike for water,\
  \ hauling jerrycans from ropes pressed against their foreheads, the weight of the\
  \ water on their backs.\n\nI never expected philanthropy to fail."
