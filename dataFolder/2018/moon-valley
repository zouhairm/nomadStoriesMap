Text: "I was in Tilcara when I heard of the \"Moon Valley\" on the border with Bolivia,\
  \ a remote place on the Ruta 40. Rarely people ventured to see it. Getting there\
  \ was complicated, if not nearly impossible. In addition, maybe we would not even\
  \ have found where to eat or sleep. Although it promised to be a show that I would\
  \ never forget, it was madness. After Abra Pampa, we would have diverted to take\
  \ the Ruta 40 to travel on a dirt road, I would have taken ages to cover less than\
  \ three hundred kilometers. The weather was not optimal, but trusting the forecasts\
  \ in the Andes can be like deciding whether or not to believe the horoscope without\
  \ knowing if that day the astrologer is a good one or a charlatan. Everywhere, there\
  \ were the pyramids of pebbles left in tribute to the Pachamama by travelers. Along\
  \ the way, we met a couple of very small villages. One was populated, the others\
  \ seemed to be abandoned. Perhaps the nomadic shepherds had left them to move somewhere\
  \ else with the flock. Occasionally, we glimpsed some llamas but mostly we were\
  \ surrounded by peace, silence and boundless horizons. \nI did not know that what\
  \ would definitely touch my heart was not the \"Moon Valley\" but a remote place\
  \ which counts about 350 souls, mostly nomadic shepherds. We entered Cusi Cusi and,\
  \ at first, nobody wanted to talk to us. Only a guy with the down syndrome approached\
  \ our car when we beckoned him asking for information, but the mother ran immediately\
  \ towards us to get him back. Although we spoke Spanish, communicating with the\
  \ locals revealed to be impossible. Fortunately, we ran into a group of hippies\
  \ who introduced themselves as archaeologists from Buenos Aires. Thanks to them\
  \ we managed to find accommodation at a farm. And then, our \"guide\" took us in\
  \ front of Santos\u2019 door. He was the chief of the village, who occasionally\
  \ ran a restaurant in his own kitchen. If he had enough food for his family, that\
  \ evening he would cook a dinner for us in exchange for a good price. We returned\
  \ an hour later. Sitting in the only room of the house, we ate the best roast chicken\
  \ ever while a five years old child peered at us all the time from a small window.\
  \ We never met Santos, still the next day at breakfast everything was different.\
  \ We got to know part of his gorgeous extended family, his house became our five-star\
  \ restaurant in the Andes and also an encyclopedia in the flesh to discover the\
  \ story and life of that corner of the world. And in the end, also \"Moon Valley\"\
  \ was magic."
