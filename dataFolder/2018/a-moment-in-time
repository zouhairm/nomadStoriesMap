Text: "We sat cross-legged on the tallest dune; gazing at the distant constellations,\
  \ listening to the sand particles dance along the windswept surface, pondering life\u2019\
  s deeper significance. An evening spent in the Sahara desert seems like a place\
  \ embedded in time; of days past, present, and future. In time, we learn from our\
  \ unfortunate mishaps, envision our wildest dreams, and live as if there is no tomorrow.\
  \ Time is forever pulsing and always on the move, however, one should never try\
  \ to influence time, rather let time influence you. \nNuno was from a Puerto Verde,\
  \ a small island. He made his way through life as a videographer, traveling the\
  \ world in search of powerful images; a man willing to lay his life down with a\
  \ camera in hand. \nEduardo grew up in Ecuador and was highly influenced by music.\
  \ Playing the guitar for a living, he decided to vagabond awhile through Morocco,\
  \ seeking inspiration and potent hashish. \nSaeed worked as a camel driver, guiding\
  \ guests into the Sahara each day. He worked seven days, rarely saw his family,\
  \ slept under the stars and, most notably, was the happiest person I have ever met.\
  \ He was simply delighted with the opportunity to interact with people from around\
  \ the world. \nI was someone who wanted to experience a new culture for the first\
  \ time, travel alone to ponder my enlightenment, and connect with strangers passing.\
  \ \nThe four of us; representing three different continents, speaking four languages,\
  \ each with a variant skin pigment, and practitioners of diverse spiritual beliefs,\
  \ could not have been any different. Yet, no matter our differences, each of us\
  \ was brought together, in time, to the top of that dune. Time made us similar and\
  \ we connected on realms I never could have expected.  We spent hours talking of\
  \ topics ranging from society music, relationships, and death. Saeed would recite\
  \ his favorite desert joke on\u201CCamel Wi-Fi,\u201D his only connection to the\
  \ outside world. Using Nuno as interpreter, along with broken English, and sand\
  \ calligraphy, we formed a dialogue. As humans, we were on a journey through time,\
  \ attempting to make sense of life. That evening, our attempt was through our connection\
  \ to one another as individuals in a moment. Was their some indelible mark made\
  \ from this cosmic occurrence? We may never know but from the gleaming smile in\
  \ Saeed\u2019s expression, to the radiant tunes from Eduardo\u2019s Lyre, or Nuno\
  \ capturing the fiery glowing landscape as the sun crept over the desert, I sensed\
  \ the energy of our connection becoming forever intertwined in time."
