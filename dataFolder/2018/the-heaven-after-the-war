Text: "Our driver Dmitriy is picking us up from our hotel near the seaside.The frontier\
  \ guard checks our passports and less than in 10 min we are then on the road entering\
  \ the unrecognized state Abkhazia.\nOur green off roader is fetching headway.The\
  \ view is beautiful and intimidating at the same time: tower blocks of the Soviet\
  \ period on the slope of the seaside seem to be inhabited.Empty windows with knocked\
  \ out glasses next to new windows.A half-real and half-ghostly place.\n\u201CDoes\
  \ anyone live there?\u2019\u201D I am confused.\n\u201CHalf of the flats are inhabited.\
  \ After the war, all Georgians were kicked out of here. They left their houses and\
  \ never came back.\u201D Dima answers politely.\nI always try to avoid political\
  \ talk. Everyone is keeping silent, going deep into their own thoughts. Sometimes\
  \ I feel shame for being not very aware of what had been happening here. However,\
  \ I see the footstep of the war.\nI feel like after crossing the border we have\
  \ got in a causal loop,which threw us back 20 years ago. I open the window, thrust\
  \ out my head. A strong stream of fresh and salty sea air mixed with the smell of\
  \ combustible gas is striking my face. \nThere are a lot of neglected buildings\
  \ on our way.The peeled off monument of Lenin with the outstretched hand watches\
  \ some ruins.His silent companion \u2013 a relaxed grazing cow.The slopes are full\
  \ of mimosa trees \u2013 another echo of the Soviet period.Woman usually are given\
  \ small fragrant twigs of mimosa on International Woman's day.It never seemed to\
  \ me beautiful until I saw it alive here, in Abkhazia.The blossoming mimosa here\
  \ is fantastic.The smell is so sweet and hot, rich and causing a headache. \nWe\
  \ are coming to the road fork. Here Iupshara River meets us. A greenish-blue mountain\
  \ stream with a drop of milk is running parallel to the road, it goes up and down\
  \ crackling between the hills with changing power, suddenly vanishes and emerges\
  \ on the other side of the road.I nearly lose my cell phone trying to make picture\
  \ out of the open window.I have never seen such a beautiful color;I have never been\
  \ racing with a wild river. \nOn the way, back the driver stops his car on the verge\
  \ of the road.There is a man with an amiable toothless smile selling oranges and\
  \ tangerines. \nHere I close my eyes and breathe in greedily.Tears are coming up.The\
  \ last thing I expected is to find heaven itself.The last thing I expected nobody\
  \ really needs this land of heaven.\nWe going back,leaving the old man and tangerine\
  \ trees growing on the cemetery among graves."
