Text: "Meeting new people and experiencing cultures is something every traveler is\
  \ interested in. Making a local connection may happen in different ways. Some people\
  \ prefer living in a host environment forgetting about their mother-tongue language,\
  \ whereas for others trying authentic meals is enough. The difference lies in the\
  \ depth of the relationships you make.\nFor me, connecting with the local culture\
  \ is living the daily life of a local and experience the new lifestyle by fully\
  \ absorbing into the new culture.\nA few months back, I was on a trip to Johannesburg,\
  \ South Africa, where I had to work on a project developing an online platform for\
  \ young entrepreneurs. I was staying at the local university \u2013 Wits, where\
  \ locals kindly offered me a room. In the beginning, I did not know what to do in\
  \ my spare time since there were just a few trips you can do, and the city itself\
  \ is dangerous. Locals even told me that criminals in Johannesburg compare white\
  \ people to money-boxes, by saying \u2018the harder you hit \u2013 the more money\
  \ you get\u2019. After these words, I started being afraid of going out. However,\
  \ this feeling of danger made me excited to know more about South African culture.\
  \ I have learnt some words in a dialect and started speaking to waiters about their\
  \ lives. My terrible, foreign-accented pronunciation of local language gave me away\
  \ immediately, but in an hour, I started feeling African. Also, during one of the\
  \ dinners, I have spoken to the owner of the restaurant and told him that I want\
  \ to experience a life of a local. He proposed me to visit Alexandra \u2013 the\
  \ poorest area of Johannesburg, and I agreed.\nThe trip to the township of Alexandra\
  \ was one of the most eye-opening experiences I have ever had. I had an opportunity\
  \ to see how people live in small shacks and enjoy their lives even in such conditions.\
  \ Also, I had a chance to speak to a man who works for the community. He has even\
  \ invited me to come to Alexandra next year for volunteering to teach children in\
  \ this township to read. \nYou can have a two day stay in a country, or live there\
  \ for a year; it doesn\u2019t matter. You will still have a more enriching experience\
  \ if you build relationships with a stranger. I think it is worth having insights\
  \ into how the life in another place is to compare it to your Lonely Planet. I could\
  \ not have planned this type of local connection, but through meeting new people,\
  \ I was rewarded with a unique cultural experience."
