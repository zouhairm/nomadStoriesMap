Text: "Perhaps the most beautiful place in Wales, the magical town of Conwy has held\
  \ onto its Medieval roots for hundreds of years, bringing both townspeople and tourists\
  \ into the heart of a time seemingly long forgotten. I spent the better part of\
  \ a rainy afternoon meandering through coastal Conwy, located just off the coast\
  \ of the Irish Sea, with my two friends and their dog Rosie, breathlessly taking\
  \ in the sights of the town. To present, this is the most ethereal place I have\
  \ ever been to.\n\nAs declared proudly on a sign in front of one of six entrances\
  \ to climb to the top of (or climb down from) the town walls, Conwy is home to \u201C\
  some of the best preserved Medieval walls in Europe!\u201D I couldn\u2019t peel\
  \ my eyes away from them, feeling a thousand untold stories of the city's rich history\
  \ brewing inside of my racing mind; I imagined what life was like for the invading\
  \ English people who lived within the walls, and for the Welsh folk who inhabited\
  \ the rolling and vibrantly green fields beyond them.\n\nWith the weather in Wales\
  \ being more rainy (as opposed to the snow that I get back in my hometown of Toronto)\
  \ between the autumn to spring months, the lush fields speckled with hundreds of\
  \ sheep were an incredible, vibrant green. From the top of the walls, you could\
  \ see the manicured grass sprawl for miles upon miles, and the moss that clung to\
  \ the ancient stone walls also took on a bright green hue. It\u2019 s hard to imagine\
  \ that Medieval soldiers once patrolled the walls.\n\nWhat's more, I having never\
  \ seen a Medieval castle in my life, snow seeing one closely left me momentarily\
  \ speechless. It looked like something out of a fairytale, of Arthurian legend.\
  \ It seemed so unreal that a structure so old could be in such amazing shape after\
  \ all these hundreds of years of wear and with so many lives passing in and out\
  \ of its walls.\n\nIn spite of the rain (and the fog and mist that it brought along\
  \ with it to settle over the castle\u2019 s looming presence in Conwy), this UK\
  \ town was beyond anything I could have imagined. In all honesty, I had never really\
  \ felt a strong desire to go to Wales and never felt inclined to visit; rather,\
  \ it was a place I said that I would go to if ever in the UK with time to spare.\
  \ Having been there now, I would gladly make a trip to the UK solely to visit Wales,\
  \ staying days to exploring this lovely country, seeing its magical sites, enjoying\
  \ the rolling green hills, and deciphering the seemingly impossible Welsh language\
  \ while doing so."
