Text: "\u201CSo these\u2026 your parents?\u201D asked the plump woman, as she opened\
  \ the bamboo tray, revealing rows of mandu. \n\nWeeks before a simple \u201Cyes\u201D\
  \ was an easy reply. But now that we had navigated the peninsulas of Busan, devoured\
  \ kim-chi everyday, and investigated every lead in my adoption file, I had no answer.\
  \ For once I wished she\u2019d mistaken me for the Korean tour-guide with the nice,\
  \ white tourists, like all the other shopkeepers did. \n\nMy silence clung to the\
  \ fresh steam and worn smells of the cramped space as my tongue navigated between\
  \ disappointment and resolve. I found myself composing a response with the bits\
  \ and pieces I knew, unsure of how to fill the now magnified gaps in knowledge.\
  \ Her simple query had pried open the box of unanswered questions I\u2019d packed\
  \ on this trip. \n\n\u201CWell, I know my mom\u2019s name was Myung-Shim Park. She\
  \ was 21 when she had me,\u201D I could say. \n\nOr, \u201CIt\u2019s hard to find\
  \ her because my adoption record only shows my mother\u2019s name and birthdate,\u201D\
  \ could be the start of an answer.\n\nThe dumpling lady\u2019s eyes flickered between\
  \ the grey-haired, safari-clad twosome, and their tongue-tied, almond-eyed daughter.\
  \ Her innocent inquiry hanging between us as she tried to make sense of this mismatched\
  \ party of three.\n\nAs my mind continued to grapple with a suitable response, we\
  \ took in every detail of the tidy shop. Shiny, metal walling reflected back our\
  \ unalike faces, from every angle. Tiny colorful stools dotted the entire room,\
  \ red, yellow, green, blue, orange, pink, leaving no trace of a pattern or purpose.\
  \ We were the only party in the place, seeking a source of comfort as we\u2019d\
  \ reached a dead end. \n\nShe gently placed a mountain of fried and steamed morsels\
  \ in front of us, as my dad nudged to life the lazy susan filled with house-made\
  \ kimchi. My mom\u2019s hands were busy organizing the silverware, her fingers betraying\
  \ the relaxed composure of her face. As the heat from the food hit our faces, I\
  \ felt a drop of sweat trickle down my back. Nothing was comfortable. \n\nBut here\
  \ we were, sharing a meal, sharing a disappointment. I could find the words to answer\
  \ this question and with time, I would find the words for all of the others. \n\n\
  As I snagged a perfectly crafted dumpling on the tips of my stainless steel chopsticks,\
  \ I locked eyes with the owner and replied, \u201CYeah. These are my parents.\u201D\
  \n\nShe smiled and left just as my bite slipped and landed in a saucy splash. \n\
  \nMy mom chuckled and said, \u201CI still can\u2019t manage to keep anything on\
  \ these darn things! Let\u2019s ask for a fork.\u201D"
