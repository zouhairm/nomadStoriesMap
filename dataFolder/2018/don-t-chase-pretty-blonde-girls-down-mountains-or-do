Text: "On a clear day, the view from the top of the Treble Cone ski resort is undeniably\
  \ epic. From a vantage point of 2000m you look down upon the pristine blue expanse\
  \ of Lake Wanaka, with its fingers and bays nestled amongst snow-capped peaks that\
  \ stretch to the horizon. As I stood there, contemplating the beauty in front of\
  \ me, I was blissfully unaware that I'd be in hospital by the end of the day.\n\n\
  This was the first day of a two-week tour around New Zealand's Southern Alps. On\
  \ the bus to the mountain I'd met a fellow solo-traveller and we instantly hit it\
  \ off. We were two like-minded people, seeking adventure far away from family and\
  \ friends. I want to say it didn't hurt that I found her attractive, but actually\
  \ it did hurt, quite a lot.\n\nAs Violeta peeked over the steep slope she smiled\
  \ at me and said, \u201CLet\u2019s go!\u201D. I followed, eager to impress my new\
  \ friend yet knowing I was out of my depth. It wasn\u2019t long before I lost control\
  \ and went flying through the air. The impact was sudden and hard and immediately\
  \ I knew something was wrong. The doctors later diagnosed a grade-3 separated shoulder\
  \ (where the collar-bone becomes detached from the shoulder-blade).\n\nThe next\
  \ day the landlady at my B&B had to tie my shoelaces for me. This was a serious\
  \ injury and all my planning went out the window. I felt depressed and angry at\
  \ myself for being so stupid. With my arm in a sling and the pain meds doing their\
  \ thing I went for a walk around the lake. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before I stumbled\
  \ upon a handmade sign that read, \u201CCellar door - this way\u201D. Out of curiosity\
  \ I followed a path up the hill, I had no idea what a \u201Ccellar door\u201D was\
  \ or why there would be a sign for one. Ten minutes later and the vineyard was visible.\
  \ Row upon row of perfectly straight vines with just their woody stalks set against\
  \ the wintery backdrop.\n\nI'd never been wine tasting before, but it was fun and\
  \ interesting and a just a little bit boozy. After learning new words like \"terroir\"\
  \ and pretending I could smell the notes of blackberries, I purchased a bottle of\
  \ my favourite, a pinot noir, and asked for a single glass. I went and sat amongst\
  \ the vines and the earth and drank their wine. Everything was going to be ok.\n\
  \nThe rest of the trip turned out fantastic. I toured vineyards instead of ski-fields\
  \ and had experiences that I would never have had otherwise. I learned that sometimes\
  \ those unexpected, random moments can make all the difference when you travel,\
  \ even if they seem bad at first."
