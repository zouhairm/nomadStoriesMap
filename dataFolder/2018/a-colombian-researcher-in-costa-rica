Text: "I passed all my year (2016) trying to find a new job, because I had graduated\
  \ from college recently and the first thing that I do after that, was to fly to\
  \ another city in Colombia (Pereira) to find a new adventure and do all the things\
  \ that you can do when you are a professional. \nIt was a crazy year, because I\
  \ am a musician and researcher and it is too difficult to get a job in the artistic\
  \ and research environment specially in my country. For that reason, I decided to\
  \ search some congresses to apply to show my university thesis. \n\nOne day, I received\
  \ an email notifying me that I had been accepted to present my paper at the University\
  \ of Costa Rica, in San Jos\xE9. That's where my adventure began. After doing all\
  \ the papers against the clock, looking for hotel, flights and others, the great\
  \ day of traveling had arrived and with it, an exciting feeling of happiness and\
  \ fear at the same time. \n\nI landed at eight o'clock in the morning at Juan Santamar\xED\
  a's airport, after taking two flights: one from Pereira to Bogot\xE1, and another\
  \ from Bogot\xE1 to San Jos\xE9. The first thing I did was change a few dollars\
  \ and, once I had collected my luggage and performed all the diligences related\
  \ to immigration, I took the taxi I had previously booked by contact from the hostel\
  \ where I was going to stay. \n\nI settled in the hostel and I went to walk and\
  \ get to know a bit of the city center, guiding myself by my instinct and I can\
  \ say that it turned out very well because everything I asked in the street was\
  \ answered by someone always smiling.\n\nThe next day, I went to the university,\
  \ to take the first lectures of the day. The people in charge of the congress were\
  \ very kind to me and, at first hand, I was able to meet various researchers, musicians\
  \ and composers from many parts of the world.\n\nWhen it was time to present to\
  \ a really cordial audience and despite feeling so nervous, I was able to make my\
  \ first international report that it was one of the best experiences of my life.\
  \ Many people congratulated me and, at the end of the presentation, I was able to\
  \ go to lunch with the logistics team of the congress, who were incredible with\
  \ me. It was the beginning  of a good friendship\n\nWell, I was looking at the beginning\
  \ of the story, a job and something to do, without imagining that apply to make\
  \ that presentation at the University of Costa Rica, would be one of the best decisions\
  \ I had made and even more so when the fact pass the respective filter, it was the\
  \ last thing I expected."
