Text: "My family is big.We're in seven, by the way it's our lucky number. We've always\
  \ been close to each other but we never expected that the year of 2012 would completely\
  \ change our lives. \nIn that year my dad was called to start anthropology's classes\
  \ at UFScar, so we all decided to move together a hundred miles from where we all\
  \ were born to help him trough this new experience. So we did it. It was the hardest\
  \ thing to move away.We all knew that we would miss our family,our neighborhood,\
  \ meeting our friends every day.We would miss school, job and the wonderful bakery\
  \ in front of our house.Even the horrible traffic every afternoon, the lazy lady\
  \ on her morning's walking or the extremly hot sensation of the city.We would miss\
  \ the simple fact of being home, and in the first three months that all happened\
  \ and more.\nWe didn't know anybody there and at the weekends our car was always\
  \ in the garage.And that's the point, there were no ways to scape from this situation\
  \ but to relate with each other. I only had my parents back and my brothers and\
  \ sisters to have fun,they could count on me as well.We were expecting to feel lonely\
  \ and empty but we did not expected that we, as a group, could return the situation\
  \ by being even more close.\nI can't describe how we've all changed with this experience.Somehow\
  \ we needed to learn that the family is the most precious thing in this precious\
  \ world, and we can be in lack of everything but we need to be surrounded by people\
  \ we love.\nA couple of months and every relation in my house was being builded\
  \ and then, we finally were able to really connect with people, to build amazing\
  \  friendships, and to explore the new.\nAnd four years later who could have imagined\
  \ that we're about to feel lonely and empty for leaving the city that we once regret\
  \ it? Everybody in my family is still in love with the city that united us,  made\
  \ us stronger and made us feel powerful to face anything no matter what. And we're\
  \ not done yet, we really do not want to leave now, maybe it's beacuse there'll\
  \ be more three years in a close future to complete the lucky number of our lives:\
  \ seven!"
