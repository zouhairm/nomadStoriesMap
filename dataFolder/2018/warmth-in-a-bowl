Text: "Cinnamon. Cumin. Saffron. Nutmeg. Ginger. Dates. Bread. Fish. It was the last\
  \ day of Ramadan, I could smell the anticipation in the air as people hustled past\
  \ one another in the market place, doing their last-minute shopping for Eid\u2013\
  the Muslim celebration of a month of fasting.\nLater that evening, I found myself\
  \ somewhere in the labyrinths of streets of Stone Town, on the Tanzanian island\
  \ of Zanzibar. I walked down the narrow stairs of my Airbnb onto the street to get\
  \ better phone service.\nThe locals have already broken the fast and were standing\
  \ around holding steaming bowls and plates of food in their hands. Sitting on the\
  \ stoop across from me, a man dressed in a dark-blue long sleeve shirt and a white\
  \ taqiyah was eating his food. He looked up from his bowl as I came down the steps\
  \ and smiled. \nI smiled back.\n\u201CKaribu.\u201D Welcome, he waved me over and\
  \ stretched out his hands to offer me his bowl of food\u2013 a steaming stew of\
  \ potatoes and meat.\n\u201CAsante sana,\u201D I waved my hands no, thank you. I\
  \ can\u2019t possibly eat his food when he has been fasting all day, although it\
  \ was past dinnertime and my stomach was empty.\n\u201CKaribu,\u201D he insisted\
  \ with another smile. From my month of travels in Tanzania, I knew this exchange\
  \ would not end until I accepted the food, so I sat down next to him, took the bowl\
  \ and ate a piece of potato.\n\u201CAsante sana,\u201D I repeated, and handed the\
  \ bowl back to him. After a few failed attempts, it became clear that he did not\
  \ speak English and my Swahili was far too inadequate to carry on a conversation.\
  \ So we sat in silence as we passed the bowl of food between us.\nIt was one of\
  \ my last days in East Africa. I had spent six weeks traveling in Tanzania and Rwanda,\
  \ letting myself sink into the East African way of life, one regulated not by schedules\
  \ and timetables, but by sunrises and sunsets, fastings and prayers, seasons of\
  \ plantings and harvests, and sounds of laughter and tears. At the same time, I\
  \ have struggled with being a constant target for attention, as I, along with the\
  \ group of mzungus (foreigners) I traveled with, drew the curiosity of the locals\
  \ everywhere we went. \nI\u2019m not Muslim, I don\u2019t speak Swahili or Arabic,\
  \ and I have never fasted a day in my life. Yet, in that short ten minutes as I\
  \ sat on the side of the street in Zanzibar, with someone whose name I did not know\
  \ and whose language I did not speak, I felt perfectly at home."
