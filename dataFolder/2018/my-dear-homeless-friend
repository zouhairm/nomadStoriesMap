Text: "In my younger and pretty tense years, like seemed to me, I stayed on the verge\
  \ of choice in life. Every day I watched the same brick high-rise buildings of the\
  \ \"Soviet\" period. If you knew Russian, you would surely smile, saying it out\
  \ loud, because it sounds like a \"scoop\".  But that's not the point right now.\n\
  In one quiet and quite iridescent evening, I returned all on the same trampled path.\
  \ In the area, pigeons flew from the roofs and straying on my way. Near the church\
  \ sat the same homeless man, but as always, he did not ask for anything from anyone.\
  \ For some reason, I always wanted to talk to him. And what do you think? Five minutes\
  \ later I sat with this man and listened attentively:\n\u201CHave you noticed wind\
  \ is variable today? Does the sun just burn our river with its sharp fangs?\u201D\
  \ he said.\nI looked at him as the person who discovered Atl\xE1ntida to me.\n\u201C\
  You probably do not want to go home? I can show you something that can expand your\
  \ eyes more than they are now,\u201D he continued.\nAnd he did not deceive. Without\
  \ a word, without any doubt, I went for this man. As he had already introduced himself,\
  \ his name was Alexander Stroyev. We went the old, collapsed bridge, which seemed\
  \ to be a dense and shady labyrinth because, during the time that we were walking,\
  \ it was getting dark in the city. On the other side, he showed me all the nooks\
  \ of abandoned buildings, staircases in the towers and also hiding places, of which\
  \ no one already remembered. It was his secret world, his refuge. \nBut most of\
  \ all I have sunk into the soul pieces of the frescoes found by Alexander in the\
  \ old house of the Kopylov family. They still passed the beauty of Ukrainian coloring.\
  \ Before the eyes as if the artist appeared, that he had drawn every twig that turns\
  \ into the fruits of the viburnum. I'm sure this is a great discovery, which will\
  \ forever remain in my memory and in the lines of this essay.\nYou know, I seemed\
  \ to be born again. I looked at our city with other eyes. As it turned out, right\
  \ in front of my nose hid a little unknown world.  And how much more upon the earth?\
  \ Life is not enough to get around."
