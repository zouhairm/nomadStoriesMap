Text: "Chicken Street is a popular shopping area in Kabul where you can buy anything\
  \ from toothpaste to assault rifles. On a pleasant Saturday afternoon, Jamal and\
  \ I were walking back to our car parked across the street. Jamal was my father\u2019\
  s driver/bodyguard/friend. He was over fifty, wore a grey kurta, white pyjama and\
  \ no beard. My father who held an Indian government post in the country, had stopped\
  \ to get takeaway from an Indian restaurant nearby. I noticed that I was already\
  \ blending in on my second day in the country, in my long dark dress and purple\
  \ hijab that covered my head and chest. \n\nThe market had the personality of a\
  \ free-spirited hippie who despised any kind of order. Butchers surveyed the streets\
  \ from behind freshly-hung animal carcasses. Young boys with trendy haircuts and\
  \ stylish jackets skateboarded through the streets while their Mothers shopped at\
  \ a distance. \u201CSome of them are girls\u201D, whispered Jamal in his Pashtuni-accented\
  \ Hindi, when he saw me looking at them. I looked up at the residential building\
  \ over the shops, and saw a teenage girl sitting in her window reading. \u2018Good\
  \ day to read\u2019, I thought to myself.\n\nWe had barely reached our car when\
  \ we heard the blast. It was loud but not too loud. Jamal hurriedly pushed me inside\
  \ our bulletproof Land Rover. My ears were ringing but I could still hear my heart\
  \ pounding in my chest. A cloud of brown dust had engulfed the air. I looked out\
  \ of my window and noticed a red, wet patch and pieces of metal and flesh, strewn\
  \ on the same path we had walked minutes ago. The skateboarders, their mothers and\
  \ the shopkeepers lay flat on the ground with their palms on their ears as if they\
  \ were trained to do so. As Jamal was looking pointedly in the direction of the\
  \ blast, his phone rang. He received it, looked at me and nodded reassuringly. Ah!\
  \ My father was safe! I closed my eyes and sank back in my seat motionless. About\
  \ a minute later when I finally opened my still-wet eyes, I saw Jamal speaking to\
  \ a local in Farsi. He opened the door and said to me, \u201CIt was a man on a cycle.\
  \ No casualties, except the bomber of course\u201D.\n\nIn Afghanistan, a suicide\
  \ bombing is simply an unfortunate alteration in your itinerary. That incident gave\
  \ me an insight into the jaded psyche of people in this war-torn country. As the\
  \ dust settled on the ground, I saw the girl in the window. She had gone back to\
  \ reading her book."
