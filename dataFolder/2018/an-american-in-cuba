Text: "\u201CDefinitely get your bag wrapped at the airport,\u201D my friend Camila\
  \ advised in her Facebook message. When asked why, she replied unequivocally, \u201C\
  because you want your stuff to be there when you arrive.\u201D I expressed in earnest\
  \ that this place was starting to sound a little shady, for lack of a better word,\
  \ and she sent back a winking face emoji and a question I would ask myself many\
  \ times throughout the trip. \u201CWhat did you expect?\u201D she mused, \u201D\
  It\u2019s Cuba.\u201D \n\nMy palms were sweaty as I sat in the airport, wondering\
  \ if I\u2019d made a terrible mistake. I ordered a rum and coke to pay homage to\
  \ my destination and attempt to calm my nerves. I was flying less than an hour away,\
  \ but this was my first communist country and despite attempts at renewed relations,\
  \ things weren\u2019t exactly \u201CP.C.\u201D between the U.S. and Cuba. \n\nThe\
  \ fear was especially pronounced after having lived in Miami for several years.\
  \ This was an island from which people were escaping in trucks turned sailboats\
  \ for the mere chance to wash up on our shores. They barely made it out with their\
  \ lives, and their little dogs too, so I couldn\u2019t understand why tourists would\
  \ be compelled to vacation in a place where the locals were so desperate to depart.\
  \ \n\nStill, I was lured by a cheap flight and repeated warnings that my window\
  \ to visit could slam shut at any moment. It appears fear of missing out is an even\
  \ stronger phobia than fear of being retained in a hostile nation while traveling\
  \ alone. Millennials really do have skewed priorities. Thankfully, I was born in\
  \ Puerto Rico and speak Spanish, so my plan was to blend in and think Cuban.  \n\
  \nI had 48 hours on the island. The first 24 were spent checking off the obligatory\
  \ Havana experiences, like riding in a pink convertible and soaking up the nostalgia\
  \ at Plaza Vieja. It wasn\u2019t until my last day that I got a peak into the real\
  \ Cuba, and was surprised at what I found. \n\nWith the help of a taxi driver turned\
  \ hourly guide, I explored outdoor art galleries where discarded items are repurposed\
  \ into visual masterpieces. I danced in a crowd of rumba enthusiasts while listening\
  \ to live music in an alley. I handed out chocolate to kids who swarmed around me\
  \ at the prospect of sweets. I saw a culture that responds to adversity not with\
  \ resignation, but with ingenuity and resolve. \u201CAs long as we have rum and\
  \ music,\u201D my driver joked, \u201Cwe have joy.\u201D     \n\nAbove all, I learned\
  \ that beyond our preconceptions lies the opportunity to gain a new perspective,\
  \ and conquer our fears."
