Text: "\u201CCan\u2019t believe I\u2019m stuck in this traffic jam at 6800feet above\
  \ sea-levels,that too on my birthday!\u201D was the first thought that popped into\
  \ my mind,when it was clear the car wasn\u2019t going to move for a while.Little\
  \ did I know what fate had in store for me,in the mountains of McLeodGanj in August\
  \ 2017!\nA distinct blend of Indian & Tibetan culture,this town is home to thousands\
  \ of displaced Tibetans,known for their hospitality,delicious steamed dumplings,warmth\
  \ & candour.Having enjoyed the sights & meals,I was on the last leg of my trip.Sitting\
  \ in a car sandwiched between motorcycles & other vehicles,my restless eyes wandered\
  \ to the shops lining the street.Seeing the hopeful shopkeeper idly sipping his\
  \ chai,I decided to hop out, much to the chagrin of my driver.Pleasantly surprised\
  \ by the aroma of sandalwood incense sticks radiating from within,I sifted through\
  \ the inviting pieces of colourful jewellery laid out for customers.\u201CWhy is\
  \ there such a rush today?\u201D I asked him curiously wondering if there was a\
  \ political/religious rally.\n\u201COh!That\u2019s because His Holiness the Dalai\
  \ Lama is in the car ahead.\u201D \nStopping dead in my tracks,I felt the prickly\
  \ heat of a tear choosing this opportunity to make an appearance.To know the weight\
  \ of this moment,you have to know the back story.For years,I\u2019d wanted to meet\
  \ the spiritual head of the Tibetans,the Dalai Lama.Now,I\u2019m not religious!But\
  \ to me,he is the epitome of the kind of leader the world needs today.His compassion\
  \ & kindness had captured my heart as a kid.Few months prior to planning my trip,\
  \ his office told me \u201Cregretfully\u201D that His Holiness would be in Botswana\
  \ in August.My heart leaped upon hearing that the person I admire most in the world\
  \ was in one of these cars! A change in plans led to him coming home early,on this\
  \ exact day!\nAmidst swaying flags, I ran with feverish joy to see my favorite wrinkled\
  \ old hands wave to the crowd, and a transient gentle smile aimed at me-one I had\
  \ only seen in pictures!It was the longest second of my life.Like time stood still\
  \ to reward me this birthday gift.Exhaustion prevented him from meeting visitors,but\
  \ I was lucky to have an hour-long conversation with his personal assistant, Jinme\
  \ ThinLe.Enlightening me on Dalai Lama\u2019s private life stories & even on politics\
  \ with China,he gifted me books blessed by the Lama,promising to arrange a meet\
  \ on my next visit.Is it any wonder that this was the most memorable birthday ever,\
  \ when the universe itself conspired to make my dream come true?"
