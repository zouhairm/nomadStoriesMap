Text: "She had lived through the Siege, so she wasted nothing. Her fridge, stuffed\
  \ with expired over-the-counter drug samples, proved that. Still, she insisted that\
  \ avoiding solar flares and regularly using piyafki were all one needed to stay\
  \ healthy. In the sixties she sat in a steel booth translating intercepted messages\
  \ from space, so I believed her about the solar flares. The other word I didn't\
  \ know, so I reached for my dictionary. Instead, she grinned, shook her tiny fist\
  \ at me, and emerged from her room staggering under an enormous jar of water. Ribbons\
  \ of inky oil spun in lazy circles against the glass. No, not oil. \n\n\"They eat\
  \ once a month, it's time, you could help!\" she winked, knowing that I would. She\
  \ was old and deserved kindness. A thin tube of hollow glass, open at both ends,\
  \ twinkled in her hand. She showed me how to hold it -against the papery skin behind\
  \ her earlobe- and then her hand plunged into the roiling jar, quick as a cat, grabbing\
  \ a body, slipping it into the tube. It writhed down, powerfully; I held on, steady.\
  \ It stopped when it encountered her skull. She said \"Good!\" and we removed the\
  \ tube. The body uncurled and reached for a second spot to latch. We repeated the\
  \ process; she put on the kettle for tea. I asked if I could take a photograph.\
  \ She frowned, then whisked away, returning with darkened brows, painted lips, an\
  \ ebony shawl embroidered with peonies and black-eyed Susans. \n\nThe TV churned\
  \ out stories about the riots consuming the capital. \"Too different,\" said the\
  \ screen, \"Not enough alike.\" Studies corroborated opinions; everyone agreed.\
  \ \"My second cousin's daughter's great-uncle told me, and he lived in that place,\
  \ you know the one, where the people\" -and here she leaned in conspiratorially,\
  \ so the leeches swung forward like dangling black gum- \"they go in the streets!\"\
  \ She spread her arms, triumphant. \"They squat, and they go. Disgusting. Dikii!\"\
  \ Something else I didn't know. \n\nWhen the leeches had quintupled in size, drooping\
  \ almost to her shoulders, I asked to take another picture, so she reapplied her\
  \ lipstick and smiled that smile. After, she pulled off her glistening earrings\
  \ and dropped them into the jar, spiriting it back to the secret place. She wiped\
  \ her neck with a cloth. Her skin was so thin, nearly translucent. She asked if\
  \ I wanted a hot water bottle- the cheap plastic soda kind, filled with boiled water,\
  \ wrapped in an old towel.\n \nCozy in bed, I looked it up. \n\nDikii: \n\nwild;\
  \ \nqueer;\npreposterous;\nsavage."
