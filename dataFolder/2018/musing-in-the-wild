Text: "Wandering in the woods of Himalayas, I least expected what will I have to face\
  \ when I had left home for the sake of my love for travelling. Bereft of all sorts\
  \ of comforts and pleasures, I was there in the dark, cold and spooky forest completely\
  \ surrounded by tall and thick trees. The orange sky was rapidly turning dark and\
  \ darker each moment. The breeze became colder and I almost felt trapped in a huge\
  \ refrigerator. I was cursing myself for following the rabbit into the woods for\
  \ a photograph. But I needed to think on the ways to get myself out of the trouble\
  \ I had put myself in. Deprived of food, water and mobile network connectivity,\
  \ I am here alone, searching for someone to guide me out of the dense forest I was\
  \ stuck in. I could find no one except thousands of bats, owls and crickets breaking\
  \ the silence. But apart from these, my starving stomach made louder noises within.\
  \ \nI had a companion, my motorbike, which was quiet not by choice but due to circumstances,\
  \ drained of all the fuel it had. My bones had become stiff and froze out of cold\
  \ and lungs felt heavy, so I could merely walk or breathe properly. It seemed my\
  \ last day on the earth, but I said no to the god of death today. I resurrected\
  \ myself, congregated my courage and strength left to gather some dry twigs, leaves\
  \ and dried branches of trees lying nearby. I poured out a little engine oil from\
  \ the bike\u2019s oil tank in my empty water bottle. Using all the gatherings, oil\
  \ and my lighter, I lit a fire and sat near it to keep myself warm, and most importantly\
  \ alive. As the night grew old, it got colder and I could merely keep myself warm\
  \ due to nasty chilly winds which blew after every little while. I was about to\
  \ get unconscious when I faintly saw a blaze of light coming towards me. A little\
  \ while later, I heard a scream which I couldn\u2019t understand. I heard a voice\
  \ calling out to me, I tried to open my eyes and I saw a group of four persons dressed\
  \ as forest guards beside me. I couldn\u2019t expect their presence, one of them\
  \ told me that they saw some kind of light and smoke and got out to have a look.\
  \ Another one of them offered me some water. \nWhen I opened my eyes I found myself\
  \ lifted by a guard on his shoulder and being proceeded towards their camp. I had\
  \ a faint smile on my face thinking about my many-more-days-to-live and the lifetime\
  \ experience I had gained that day."
