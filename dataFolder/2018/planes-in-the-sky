Text: "I\u2019m in a parc with several thousand people in all sorts of leisurely activities,\
  \ all in groups, many families, all engaged with one another\u2014the people they\
  \ already know. I am in the middle of all this, alone, centering myself among protective\
  \ trees journaling because it\u2019s hot as hell and Ms. Sun, she\u2019s not sorry.\
  \ The occasional cutie walks by and I\u2019m inspired. A playful kid runs by and\
  \ I smile. None of it has anything to do with me\u2014just an environment for me\
  \ to observe. The commanding summit of rollings hills seat dozens of glistening\
  \ bodies, fascinated by planes in the sky.\n\nIt\u2019s beautiful to hear the immediate\
  \ responses of parents to children\u2019s simple requests: \xAB Papa! Tu peux m\u2019\
  aider? \xBB It makes me think to the last time I called out in this way and got\
  \ a response. I feel the tears well up in my eyes, but I don\u2019t cry. You\u2019\
  re crying. How can you cry with all the beautiful writing in the sky? It\u2019s\
  \ Parc Buttes-Chaumont! Enchanting and beautiful. He would have loved this--exalted\
  \ high on hills closer to the sun than he\u2019s ever been. Closer to a son than\
  \ he\u2019s ever been.\n\nWe could be drenched in sun together. Instead I\u2019\
  m left alone as he travels to places I cannot go. This is the beginning to some\
  \ piece of theatre. If it\u2019s not, it should be. Asking for Daddy in a dark,\
  \ cavernous space multiple times with no reply. It\u2019s sad because it will always\
  \ be this way. This is the pain and discomfort I\u2019m getting used to and never\
  \ expected. A dance should come from this once my body feels inspired to move again.\
  \ For now movement is mechanical, not for expression. I hear him sometimes but he\
  \ can\u2019t answer directly anymore as he used to. The country he lived in was\
  \ designed for him to see his end sooner than later. This makes me furious. The\
  \ world had more options to offer him, but I couldn\u2019t encourage him yet to\
  \ see more of the world. Does everything feel as chaotic for you as it does for\
  \ me? The three months feels like days ago that I first discovered the news: he\
  \ doesn\u2019t exist here anymore. I never expected a loss so great from so far\
  \ away. I\u2019m sitting quiet, observing and thinking; you\u2019re in a parc with\
  \ your family and friends; we\u2019re all still fascinated by planes in the sky."
