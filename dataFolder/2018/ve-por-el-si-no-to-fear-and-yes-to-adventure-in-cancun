Text: "When my husband and I spent our honeymoon at a posh resort in Canc\xFAn, the\
  \ last thing I expected to experience there was a reckoning with my greatest fear.\
  \ \n \nWe had just dropped $180 for a \u201Cjungle tour\u201D by speedboat. But\
  \ when we arrived at the dock, we discovered that the boat tour was not along a\
  \ jungle river as advertised, but through miles of open water in the Caribbean instead.\
  \ The \u201Cjungle\u201D aspect of the tour consisted of a brief, brief crossing\
  \ through the marshes of Nichupt\xE9 Lagoon. \n \nAs the tour guide explained the\
  \ boat\u2019s controls, I looked away, towards the sea. I could see white crests\
  \ flashing in the sun, the ocean\u2019s stippled surface a gorgeous disguise for\
  \ its power and danger. The idea of boating on open water had me hot and cold all\
  \ over, dizzy, and feeling like my mahi-mahi might return unannounced. \n\nI have\
  \ been terrified of the ocean ever since I was 18 and nearly drowned in a rip tide.\
  \ \n \nIt was Beach Week after my high school graduation. The water that day was\
  \ rough, the waves coming high and fast on the front edge of a storm. Feeling the\
  \ wind on my face and the force the waves carried, I made sure to be careful. I\
  \ did everything right. I was sober, I wore sunscreen, I swam with a group, I didn\u2019\
  t go in above my waist. But then a wave came, taller than the rest, that knocked\
  \ me off my feet. \n \nWithin two seconds I was sucked out to sea. Between the panic\
  \ and the waves, I couldn\u2019t keep my head above water. I went under for the\
  \ last time. Then, as I was asking God to make death painless, my friend rescued\
  \ me. \n \nSince that day, just seeing the ocean on TV is enough to send my heart\
  \ racing. As we stood on the dock in Canc\xFAn, all I wanted was to drag my husband\
  \ away from the water, back to our palapa by the pool and a nice margarita. But,\
  \ I decided, five years of being afraid was more than enough. They say you can\u2019\
  t expect your partner to change when you marry them, but that doesn\u2019t mean\
  \ that you can\u2019t change, or shouldn\u2019t. And if I have any say in the matter,\
  \ I\u2019m going to change for the better.\n \nI turned my attention back to the\
  \ tour guide. He was saying we\u2019d be on open water for forty-five minutes each\
  \ way. \u201CDo you feel okay about this?\u201D my husband asked. And I thought\
  \ about a saying a friend had shared with me once, at a moment when I was looking\
  \ for the courage to take a risk in my career. It went, \u201CEl no ya lo tienes;\
  \ ve por el s\xED.\u201D \n\nYou\u2019ve already got your \u201Cno.\u201D Go after\
  \ the \u201Cyes.\u201D\n \nI squeezed my husband\u2019s hand. I said yes."
