Text: "I have always been an artist, I earned my Bachelor of Fine Arts in 1999, but\
  \ never found my niche in the world. I\u2019m a dreamer and a romantic and patiently\
  \ waited for my handsome prince to join me in exploring the earth. I\u2019ve lost\
  \ count of the heart breaks, failed relationships and let downs from the men in\
  \ this world, but there was one that pushed me to the edge. He was a professional\
  \ photographer in a not so professional industry. He neglected me like the others\
  \ and mad me feel unappreciated and unimportant. I would clear every weekend to\
  \ spend with him, only to be stood up and avoided. I thought, if I could impress\
  \ him with my photography skills, it might do the trick. I started off with stronger\
  \ statements than I was used to and would say, \u201CCharlie, I\u2019m going to\
  \ an abandoned ghost town deep in WV, if you want to join me, I\u2019ll be leaving\
  \ at 7am this Saturday.\u201D He never joined me, but it gave me a drive to improve\
  \ my photography and artistic abilities. \nIn November of 2016 I decided I would\
  \ no longer wait for that prince and at age 39 I was going to stop waiting and start\
  \ living. There was always something in these failed relationships holding me back;\
  \ either they didn\u2019t have a job to pay their own way or they didn\u2019t have\
  \ the desire to travel. I decided that I would ask my mom to join me on an adventure\
  \ in Playa Del Carmen, Mexico. This was the beginning of a new life for me. A life\
  \ of culture and adventure all documented in my photography. We lept at every opportunity\
  \ that we could afford in Quinta Roo. We mingled with the locals, learned the language\
  \ and participated in ancient cerimonies with the Mayans whom I immediately loved.\
  \ I began to conquer my fear of heights by rappelling 80 feet into a sacred Cenote.\
  \ I snorkeled for the first time at the beautiful Maroma Beaches and saw clear water,\
  \ which has always been a dream of mine. I finally felt like I belonged; I felt\
  \ as if I had lived in the wrong country my entire life. \nNow, a year later I have\
  \ traveled since to Switzerland, France and Italy. I saw the tiny village of Cori,\
  \ Italy where my family roots are. I travel every weekend with my dog, Aspen, to\
  \ find beauty in the most peculiar places. My following on Instagram encourages\
  \ me to do more and more. My next big adventure will be to Uganda next month. I\
  \ feel the excitement welling up inside me. It\u2019s been almost 20 years since\
  \ I\u2019ve been to Africa and I will see it with new eyes and a brand new camera.\
  \ Waiting 39 years to start life wasn\u2019t a mistake!"
