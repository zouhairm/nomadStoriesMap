Text: "As I walk up the stairs to my room in Santa Marta, Colombia I feel a pang of\
  \ discomfort right away as I realize the house looks nothing like the pictures.\
  \ Soap is unheard of in this house and it has a pungent odour of sea salt and decaying\
  \ yuca. There is a thick layer of dust on every surface and blood stains on my mattress.\
  \ The host definitely did not look like his charming online photo. For the next\
  \ two days he follows me wherever I go, including my room. He asks for money and\
  \ insists I pay for him wherever we go. As he follows me to the beach and we lay\
  \ on the sand, I start to feel unbelievably cold and cannot stop shaking. It was\
  \ probably due to the dirty drinking water, but caused me to remain house locked\
  \ with no food for 24 hours. Days later I go to the beach and the host follows again.\
  \ He takes a walk around the water as I lay on the sand recovering from my foreign\
  \ fever with tears streaming down my sunburnt cheeks. A man selling sunglasses approaches\
  \ me. He notices my discomfort and takes off his sunglasses, allowing me to see\
  \ into his deep brown eyes. A slightly forced wave of comfort washes over me. I\
  \ tell him everything and he listens attentively, nodding his head, raising his\
  \ eyebrows and keeping his eyes connected to mine. \"Meet me here tomorrow at 3,\"\
  \ he says. He goes by Julio. The following day comes and the host follows me out.\
  \ Julio sneaks me his number and I call him at 12 a.m that night. \"I want to help\
  \ you, bring all your stuff and tell the host you're leaving Santa Marta\". Julio\
  \ waits for me downstairs and I tell the host I am leaving as I grab my tiny red\
  \ suitcase and head out. Julio tells me to hide to be safe. We enter his friend's\
  \ restaurant and I take cover behind the counter. The customers are confused and\
  \ I feel like I am in a movie. The host came looking but I was out of sight. Julio\
  \ bought me lunch and helped me find another place to stay. It was cleaner and more\
  \ than I could have ever hoped to find on my own. On my last day in Santa Marta\
  \ I grab an \xC1guila and arepa from the street vendor just by the new place. I\
  \ sit on the sidewalk and sip the cold, refreshing beer. \"The harder the war, the\
  \ sweeter the victory\" I think to myself when I hear a familiar, warm voice. \"\
  Julio, gracias por todo\" I say sincerely. \"You better come back to Santa Marta,\"\
  \ he says back and we part ways."
