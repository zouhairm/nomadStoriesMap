Text: 'whenever we go to another country or region we try to make connection with
  local surroundings and people.For this purpose travellers do lot of new things,
  for instance they try to speak the language of country where they are going or they
  try to have appearance like local civics,but making local connection is more than
  that.


  it is about local people,they give unplanned experience to tourists and make whole
  trip amazing.I remember ,once i went to kolkata, which is in the east side of india,like
  other tourists, i went to all the famous places where guide lead me, it was the
  last day of my trip,i went to local restaurant,no table was available,one local
  guy who was sitting alone asked me to join him, i joined him.We started talking
  with each other,i told him that i am a tourist ,he asked me about my experience
  in kolkata,i told him about everything i did and places i visited.He told me then
  " you may think that you have been to every place in kolkata but still there are
  so many places, which no guide will ever tell you about",i said "i still have few
  hours you can tell me where they are"and he replied "i can take you there" inly
  i was afraid and thinking "am i trusting right person,i know nothing about him,he
  may be a criminal who will later rob me but i kept going with him and we stopped
  at a place which looked to me very scary but then he pointed his finger toward a
  jetty, which he told me that is abandoned.I went on the jetty and experienced most
  beautiful view of kolkata city.

  That experience made me diffrent from so many tourists and i was feeling special
  connection with locality.'
