Text: "I had my opinions on the occupied territories and on a recent trip to Israel,\
  \ definitely did not want to go to these disputed areas out of principal. Nevertheless,\
  \ I found myself in Israel going to the Golan Heights with a former, decorated General\
  \ of the Israeli Army who had offered to take me to the site of the darkest days\
  \ of his life \u2013 the 1976 battle with Syria over the disputed Golan Heights.\
  \ What could I say but, \u201CYes.\u201D A graduate student at the time, I had a\
  \ lot of opinions on the Golan Heights and the other occupied territories \u2013\
  \ I decided to keep my mouth shut. \n \nThe General picked me up at daybreak from\
  \ Tel Aviv and we stopped for coffee, snacks, and to take pictures. A few hours\
  \ later we entered the Golan Heights. The hills were dotted with small patches of\
  \ trees and farms, with streams running through the landscape. Barbed wire fences\
  \ and signs of live mines all around us scarred the beauty of the hills, as too\
  \ did the bombed out buildings and remnants of bunkers. The general stopped the\
  \ car when we reached the site of the battle of \u201976.  Being at that spot brought\
  \ memories to my host who grew reflective. \n \nThe hot sun beat down on us and\
  \ we sat under a tree and the General began to speak.  He and his battalion had\
  \ not expected the battle. Most Israeli forces had been moved to the Egyptian border,\
  \ and he remained with only his artillery regiment and a few tanks.  He told us\
  \ how all night long the battle raged\u2013 no one ate or slept. When the sun rose,\
  \ a graveyard of tanks lay in the field.  His voice was filled with melancholy and\
  \ nostalgia. On the one hand his tiny battalion beat a much larger force, but on\
  \ the other hand, many people lost their lives.\n \nWe returned to the car to get\
  \ lunch. In the distance, you could hear the gunshots from the current Syrian war.\
  \ We finally arrived at the restaurant, ironically, a Syrian-owned restaurant. The\
  \ restaurant owner knew the general and we all sat down together \u2013 a Syrian,\
  \ an Indian, an Israeli, and an Iranian.\n \nAfter lunch, we returned to the car\
  \ and set out to drive back to Tel Aviv. The day\u2019s experience opened my eyes\
  \ to good nature of people, ostensibly enemies, more than anything had in the past.\
  \ While I still have my opinions on the occupied territories, I will always remember\
  \ the General and the generous people I met."
