Text: "The first thing I notice about Mr. Khan was his smile. Innocent and humble,\
  \ it beamed across the crowded room as if it was the best thing on his face. The\
  \ scent of the local flavors and musical ambience of local folk music filled my\
  \ mind with serenity. It had been long since I had heard anything like this.\nI\
  \ was visiting the Khan family for the first time but the desire was to come over\
  \ again and again, first to listen to the local tunes which had the bliss of its\
  \ own, and then just to visit was capturing. We sat down amongst them as a local\
  \ crowd of the village was gathering to listen to the folk music as it seemed to\
  \ us as one local connection for the entire villagers. Mr. Khan and group started\
  \ with a local scale and acceptance of thought which was very impressive to listen,\
  \ with Huka smells of the elderly in the house it was more scenic to capture with\
  \ my photographic skills but I settled back just with an erge to listen to more\
  \ of what Mr. Khan was doing. He started to scale his throat with music sounds so\
  \ that everything what\u2019s to be heard by us for the evening is blissful. Sounds\
  \ of guitar , harmonium and other local instruments started filling the place and\
  \ mood started to float in to the place where everyone were slowly gathering . They\
  \ group started playing from afternoon in the day and then into the evening, wouldn\u2019\
  t have realized this if I would not have had a look at my watch. The music filled\
  \ the place with enlightened and filled our souls with captivating peace, being\
  \ a person who has never heard folk music to then becoming an obsessed listener\
  \ changed my entire idea of folk music. The happiness all the people of the Mr.\
  \ Khan\u2019s group had on their face was such happiness to watch because little\
  \ they had but so much to give to all of us who were there. If these are the words\
  \ which spring to mind as one listens to this piece of music, there is a very good\
  \ chance one is like to convey those feelings and moods to the audience in performance,\
  \ and, for the audience, this makes for a far more involving concert experience.\
  \ And, believe me, I have been to concerts where the performer has perhaps not done\
  \ this kind of exercise. I had never thought that being in place which was on lower\
  \ standards as per city lives would be such an entertainment to live up to."
