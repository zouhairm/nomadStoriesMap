Text: "It was an early January morning and mist was enveloping the square of D\xE2\
  zhdovnitsa \u2013 a Bulgarian village of about 140 Muslim people, situated in the\
  \ Rhodope Mountains. I intended to take the path twisting above the mouth of the\
  \ river, but still felt a bit tired since a trampling noise on the patio had woke\
  \ me up after midnight. I\u2019d already had an unexpected visit from a man in his\
  \ 70s, who was staggering around and murmuring, \u201CWhe-a-I? Whaat\u2019s-tha-place?\u201D\
  \ He turned out to be a local who\u2019d moved to a neighbouring village, and, as\
  \ there wasn\u2019t a pub there, he would walk to D\xE2zhdovnitsa to down a drink\
  \ with his gradually decreasing friends. This time, though, the pub had been long\
  \ closed and I carefully opened a crack in the curtain to see the most unlikely\
  \ guests staring at me \u2013 two mules. It felt like we had an appointment of which\
  \ I had forgotten, and after exchanging silent regards, the mules went back to the\
  \ street, glowing in the saturated yellow light from the two lamps. When I told\
  \ him about that, Emin, the owner of the pub, opined that the mules, too, came from\
  \ another village. \u201CWe have none here. Maybe they are from P\xE2dartsi, which\
  \ is 7 kilometres away.\u201D Then, he offered me a ride to a boat restaurant, named\
  \ Moby Dick, swaying in the splendid K\xE2rdzhali dam, but I was more drawn to the\
  \ anthropomorphic figures hidden in the rocks, and the niches that have been identified\
  \ as ancient cult complexes. In the past, the locals called them dzhinavis pendzheri,\
  \ meaning \u201Cspirits\u2019 windows\u201D as magical beings were believed to appear\
  \ there. I\u2019d read in a guide that they could \u201Cconnect people with the\
  \ Cosmos\u201D, but when I quoted this to the men who were playing cards in the\
  \ pub, they all burst into laughter. According to them, the legend was invented\
  \ to attract tourists or at least those who believed in it had disappeared. Yet\
  \ there was one person who disagreed. Asil assured me that he had seen them when\
  \ he was ten years old. It was on a summer day, too hot to take the cows out to\
  \ pasture. He was wondering outside the village when he heard joyful music drifting\
  \ from the so-called Rock Window, and the next moment, he saw a crowd of people,\
  \ some of them on horses, who were celebrating a wedding. He looked serious when\
  \ specifying that, \u201CThey had human bodies, but the heads of animals\u201D,\
  \ and that they would have taken him with them if he hadn\u2019t run away at the\
  \ instant. \u201CYour mules, they might be dzhinevizi, too,\u201D he added, moving\
  \ away with the smoke of his cigarette."
