Text: "A choppy four-hour boat ride from the southeast of Taiwan leads to a secret\
  \ island. Its terrain is rugged and, at first, the island feels dark and mysterious.\
  \ To visit, you must be brave enough to give up English, scale through steep mountainside\
  \ jungles, and zip past radioactive terrain. It is Lanyu- one of the last displays\
  \ of Tao aboriginal life in our ever-advancing world.\n \nLodge with locals to be\
  \ invited to traditional aboriginal meals and tour secret sights, unseen by non-locals.\
  \ Transportation on Lanyu is only by scooters with which you explore roads framed\
  \ by a buzzing tropical jungle. Trace the island's perimeter of jagged volcanic,\
  \ steep, and ancient coral shorelines. Try fly fish- the islanders traditional source\
  \ of income. To experience ancient recipes, order from an all-Chinese menu and try\
  \ to guess the foods you will eat. You need at least three days to enjoy the lush\
  \ forests and vivid crystal-blue ocean waves. You may even witness the traditions\
  \ of the Tao.\n \nThis island is a treasure map. As if mother nature made the island\
  \ to feed the imagination, you'll see enormous volcanic rocks like the twin lions,\
  \ lovers arch, and the open-mouthed dragon. The stops are clearly labeled and each\
  \ one is an adventure of its own. Get a 360 view of the entire island from the silent\
  \ top of the mountain, 550 meters above sea level. If you are lucky, the sky will\
  \ be clear for you to catch the mysteriously elusive sunrise.\n \nDiscover the hidden\
  \ bodies of water at the top of Lanyu's mountains. Ride up a steep and winding road\
  \ from the northwest of the island to a small pond and towering ivory white lighthouse.\
  \ Avoid going just after rainfall as the trail dives through muddy and tangled tree\
  \ roots. Hike through the thick jungle to find a wide mountain top lake. Small monkeys\
  \ play at the water's edge. In the southwest, drive by quickly- there is radioactive\
  \ waste forcefully stored here. \n \nThe Tao aboriginal group can only be found\
  \ on Lanyu. The neighboring Green Island, Luda, has lost its aboriginal culture\
  \ to the grasps of heavy tourism while the Tao traditions remain pure. Don\u2019\
  t stray from roads and well-worn paths as private graves are unmarked throughout\
  \ the jungle. Furthermore, the island is rich with dry waterfalls and sudden sheer\
  \ drops for the careless wanderer. The Tao will tell you that they are fighting\
  \ to defend their traditions and the health of their land. Respect the landscape\
  \ and the culture and the island will receive you with open arms."
