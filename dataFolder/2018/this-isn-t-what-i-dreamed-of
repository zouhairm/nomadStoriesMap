Text: "I can\u2019t see my own hand when it is stretched out in front of me. The darkness\
  \ envelopes me completely, the only thing I have is a guiding star in the sky, and\
  \ the deep red glow of the compass to help me keep the boat\u2019s heading. I look\
  \ at the depth reader and there are 3000 feet beneath our little sailboat. \n\n\
  Something in me starts to break down. I try to hold it together, but I can feel\
  \ the tears starting to well and the waves of anxiety in my chest building.\nI feel\
  \ like I am out of my depths. The ocean is rough, the consequences are dire and\
  \ somehow, I am in charge of this 3 am to 6 am watch. \n\nI must keep reminding\
  \ myself that this is actually my dream. It\u2019s been years of planning and working\
  \ towards setting off sailing around the world. My mind keeps drifting to the fact\
  \ that all of my life\u2019s belongings, plus the one person I love more than anything\
  \ in the world, my husband, and I are all at the mercy of me staying awake and steering\
  \ the right course.  It will be fine, I just need to make sure we don\u2019t somehow\
  \ hit a whale or a cliff face, or unmarked rock and sink our floating home.\n\n\
  Sebastian will be up in a couple of hours to take over hand steering, I tell myself\
  \ to push the tears away, embrace this feeling of vulnerability and to just appreciate\
  \ how amazing this adventure is. It works for a minute and then I look at the compass\
  \ course, check my guiding star, glance at the depth reader and again I feel like\
  \ it\u2019s all too much and the tears start pouring down my cheeks.\n\nIn my nativity,\
  \ I thought it was all sunsets, mojitos, and beautiful turquoise anchorages when\
  \ I had dreamt about sailing off into the sunset with the man I love. Tonight is\
  \ a stark contrast to the beautiful dream I use to post pictures of on my vision\
  \ board. I was about 500km from the nearest port, I didn\u2019t really have an exit\
  \ option.\n\nHere I am on this 32-foot sailboat that we saved for and then sold\
  \ all our possession to move on to. I am out in the middle of the Indian Ocean and\
  \ I am crying\u2026. Really? I literally slap myself out of it. Yes, it is terrifying,\
  \ yes, I feel enormous pressure to not mess up, and no, there is no option to exit\
  \ this situation. I have one choice, and this is to face the fear I am feeling straight\
  \ on. I look up at the starry night sky, I take in a big deep breath of beautiful\
  \ ocean air and I decide this isn\u2019t going to defeat me. I can do this."
