Text: "I woke up that morning showing all my teeth. I had breakfast and I could not\
  \ stop smiling in such a crazy way while I was dropping the food all over my trousers.\
  \ I jumped on the jeep and when I sat down I could not stop moving. Indra drove\
  \ us in the jungle until we were fully immersed in it. I frenetically walked through\
  \ the trees until I reached an open plain. Immediately every movement in my body\
  \ stopped and my jaw dropped down: there she was, the most beautiful princess I\
  \ had ever seen, Monica. She stood tall and pride, chewing with a detached look.\
  \ She was wearing a grey rough suit and had pink freckles all over her nose. Her\
  \ brown hair was cut short and I freezed when she looked at me with those big eyes.\
  \ \u201CCome on\u201D said the most beautiful elephant in Sri Lanka. I refused to\
  \ sit on the howdah and settled myself on her neck. During the trip I never stopped\
  \ caressing her hair, bending on her head and looking at her from the top. I was\
  \ lost in her cute eyes when I felt I was falling and I heard the sound of water:\
  \ we entered a pond. Immediately I woke up and I saw the wonder around me. I never\
  \ had such a beautiful first-date. Green trees like emeralds let their branches\
  \ fall on the pond and their leaves lashing the water. The fog flattened on the\
  \ surface capturing the light. It was the early morning and the sun danced at east.\
  \ A heron started a rough lyric that blended with the sound of Monica\u2019s giant\
  \ feet in the water. I closed my eyes for a while, feeling the heat of her body\
  \ and listening to the world around us. Monica\u2019s ears softly hit my feet like\
  \ giant butterflies. We came back to the land and I could feel all her strength\
  \ fall on the ground: an earthquake of emotions trembled trough my limbs at each\
  \ step. Those steps are still impressed in my hearth like Buddha\u2019s ones on\
  \ Adam\u2019s Peak. Inside the jungle a green roof covered us and the morning darkness\
  \ was broken by light foils of sun. The monkeys were mocking us but I did not care:\
  \ we had a rainbow of birds singing our love until the trees faded on the horizon\
  \ and the sun immortalized that beautiful gash of my heart. I had the time to fully\
  \ enjoy that trip till we got back. I became one with my princess. I started looking\
  \ beyond nature and I was not sad when I left her because I keep every moment in\
  \ my heart and my eyes, I can feel it on my skin and in my ear. That day, that encounter,\
  \ that event, that wonderful princess was at the same time everything I had ever\
  \ wanted and the last thing I expected."
