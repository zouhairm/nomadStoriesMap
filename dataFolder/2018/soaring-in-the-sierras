Text: "Backpacking isn\u2019t about building character, it\u2019s about finding character\
  \ \u2013 this saying came to life during one of my excursions in the Sierra Nevada\
  \ Mountain range. \n\nCalifornia was in the height of a five-year long drought.\
  \ A blight that radically changed the landscape from the coast to the mountains,\
  \ an event that also unveiled hidden secrets in the snowcapped peaks and valleys\
  \ of the range. The morning was cold. Coffee and conversation warmed out bellies\
  \ and moral, and just I was dumping the rest of the coffee, two gentlemen approached\
  \ us and asked for a cup. \nWe asked the quotidian hiker questions, expecting the\
  \ typical answer of how many miles they had traveled and where they were headed,\
  \ instead the men told us a story.\n\nForty years ago, during a calm day in south\
  \ central California, one of their friends decided to take his personal Cessna out\
  \ for a routine flight. The weather is famous in the area for sudden changes, and\
  \ within minutes, he found himself in a storm flying 30,000 feet above the Sierras.\
  \ That was the last they heard of him. He never returned from that flight. Over\
  \ the next few months after the crash, hundreds of search teams failed to find any\
  \ remains or evidence of the plane. The men refused to give up looking for their\
  \ friend and promised themselves that they would find him. They were convinced that\
  \ their friend would have aimed for one of the hundreds of lakes in the mountains\
  \ giving him the best chance of surviving the crash. \nThe drought lowered the lakes\
  \ fifteen feet, and they heard word of a plane cockpit barley visible in one of\
  \ the lakes. To our amazement, they asked if we wanted to join them \u2013 enthusiastically,\
  \ we said yes. The locals expertly guided us, without the use of navigational instruments,\
  \ through the turns and trails of the mountain paths.  \n\nA lake came into view.\
  \ Even from afar, we could make out a manmade object just barely breaking the calm\
  \ surface. The old men were not as visibly as the rest of us were. One of the men\
  \ exclaimed \u201Cits not him, that is plastic, his plane was glass.\u201D Sure\
  \ enough, it was not a plane, but a helicopter.\nOur groups parted ways. The gentlemen\
  \ ready for a rest, and we were far off-course. I contacted them a few months later,\
  \ curious to see if they had any luck after our adventure. They said the trip with\
  \ us was their last, they were too old, and too tired to continue looking. I let\
  \ them know that I would go back to the Sierras, and look one last time for their\
  \ old friend."
