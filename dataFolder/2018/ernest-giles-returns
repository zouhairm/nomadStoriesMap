Text: "This certain story begins in the Central Australian Desert, where I spent three\
  \ months working in a remote tourism resort. I spent most of the year 2017 doing\
  \ this, travelling from resort to resort in different parts of Australia, from here\
  \ in the red centre, to the vibrant Great Barrier Reef, to the rugged alpine landscapes\
  \ of Tasmania.\n\nThere wasn't much to do here in King's Canyon, except for hiking\
  \ along the many trails and sandstone ranges. I had completed the iconic King's\
  \ Canyon Rim walk several times so I decided to step up in my hiking game and embark\
  \ along the 22km Giles Track. Due to the dry heat of the desert out here, it was\
  \ recommended that I begin this hike at the crack of dawn.\n\nSo, this is what I\
  \ did. The sun hadn't risen before I began venturing along the narrow dirt track\
  \ from Kathleen Springs. I had a torch to see where I was going until the sun rose,\
  \ which was an hour into my journey. There was always spectacular sunrises, sunsets\
  \ and bright blue skies here in the driest part of Australia. It hardly ever rained.\
  \ Only in the Summer months, which right now it was Winter. \n\nSomeone from the\
  \ resort had told me the day before that at certain points along the Giles Track,\
  \ the dirt track drops off and you need to follow the direction the red marker is\
  \ pointing to reach the next one, even though you can't see the next one from a\
  \ distance. I mustn't have slept too well the night before, because soon after sunrise\
  \ I found myself walking through the spiky spinifex when the track dropped off for\
  \ the first time, knowing well and truly that it had been awhile since I had last\
  \ seen a red marker. I panicked a little, as you would, the thought of being lost\
  \ out here in the barron wilderness, and to be honest, I was thinking the worst,\
  \ that I was going to be stuck out here forever.\n\nBut then I used my survival\
  \ instincts, and re-traced my steps back through the spinifex, and eventually found\
  \ the red marker. From here, I embarked again, making sure I walked in the exact\
  \ direction of the marker. This happened several times during the 22km journey.\
  \ It made me think of how the original Indigenous ancestors of this land found their\
  \ way when there was no such thing as plastic markers, and it was pure survival\
  \ instinct, and being aware of landmarks.\nFrom this experience, it has definitely\
  \ strengthened my hiking abilities and way of not panicking in situations where\
  \ you feel like you are lost in this foreign land; stopping, breathing, one step\
  \ back, two forward"
