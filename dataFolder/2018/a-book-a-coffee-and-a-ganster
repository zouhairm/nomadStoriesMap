Text: "The smell of tobacco in the air welcomed me to Barcelona as soon as I left\
  \ the metro station located in front of Plaza Catalunya. I looked dazzled at the\
  \ famous ramblas and their bustling nightlife, the streets and buildings of the\
  \ Gothic quarter, stunning because of its medieval appearance but abruptly consumed\
  \ by several expensive clothing stores, restaurants of all kinds and colorful souvenir\
  \ shops filled with the art of Gaud\xED embodied in fridge magnets. This was a different\
  \ Barcelona than the one in the 80s.\nIt all started a year ago, when I bought a\
  \ book just because its title \"Confessions of a Gangster in Barcelona\". I devoured\
  \ it in a few weeks and found out it was not only a real story but his author and\
  \ main character was still living there! \nI contacted him through twitter to interview\
  \ him for a bolivian newspaper, although my motivation was guided more by fanaticism\
  \ than by journalistic instinct, that interview was the beginning of an unexpected\
  \ friendship with one of the most interesting persons I've ever met in my life.\n\
  A former gangster, drug user and bank robber from the 80's called Daniel Rojo but\
  \ nicknamed \"The Millionaire\".\nHe has well earned his place as a symbol from\
  \ the 70's and 80's underground Barcelona, the stories about his criminal lifestyle\
  \ are endless, one more interesting than the other, including the one on how he\
  \ redeemed himself to change his life.\nHe\u2019s passionate about life and how\
  \ blame him if he has escaped death countless times, enjoyed worldly pleasures like\
  \ no other human being who is alive to tell. He has the expertise of a drug connoisseur\
  \ because he overused them all until one day he left them forever. He was a millionaire\
  \ with bank stolen money but paid his dues in prison for 19 years and now he is\
  \ a famous crime novel writer that overflows charisma with every word he says. \n\
  His book made me fall in love with Barcelona to the point of crossing half the world\
  \ to get there. \nAnd now, I was walking along Passeig de Gracia, one of the most\
  \ famous avenues in Catalonia, heading towards the coffee shop where I was about\
  \ to meet my long distance friend. \nHis warm hug and amused smile welcomed me to\
  \ his city. We spent hours talking about his books, life, ancient adventures and\
  \ plans for the future.    \nI left Barcelona with three novels signed and personally\
  \ dedicated by my friend and the urgent feeling of returning to this wonderful city\
  \ in the shortest possible time."
