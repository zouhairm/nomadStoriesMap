Text: "It was supposed to be an all-inclusive couples resort, a fiery beacon of luxury,\
  \ pleasure and respite for Americans tired of the everyday 9-5. Ryan, my partner,\
  \ had signed us up for the getaway without my knowledge and without my consent.\
  \ I merely opened the door and entered our modest one- bedroom condo, simultaneously\
  \ exiting an insanely busy day at work, when Ryan bombarded me with the news only\
  \ a few minutes after entry, my comfort-seeking quest slowly dissolving at the sight\
  \ of Ryan's over-exaggerated facial excitement. I had just been given a promotion\
  \ over the department I had joined only two years ago, so finding out that we had\
  \ booked a week vacation to an island thousands of miles away seeped anxiety into\
  \ my bones. \n\"Look, I know this was supposed to be a surprise but why did it have\
  \ to be at the most inopportune time? You know I shouldn't be away from the office\
  \ right now, the learning curve alone will be drawn out longer than need be if i\
  \ go. Can we please push the trip out a few months?\" I implored and begged in vain.\
  \ Ryan seemed to enjoy my frustration. \"It'll do us good to get away. Work will\
  \ always be there.\" I wanted to remind him, only slightly in jest, that an island\
  \ known for its attacks on gays and homophobia would most likely still be there\
  \ as well, but I didn't want to ruffle feathers. Maybe, he was right. Maybe a quick,\
  \ week's long vacation was what I needed. In fact the resort itself, from the brochure\
  \ Ryan was slamming into my face along with his repeated statistics about rum-making\
  \ and all the amenities involved, seemed nice. I'm sure all the horrors that I heard\
  \ in regards to Jamaica being a sort of Hell- on- Earth for gay couples wasn't representative\
  \ of the resorts and areas that attracted tourists by the millions each year. \n\
  On the plane to Jamaica, however, Ryan and I had a fight. But the fight wasn't your\
  \ typical fight a couple would usually have. It was more philosophical in that I\
  \ finally decided to bring up the fact that Jamaica wasn't supposed to be safe for\
  \ LGBT tourists. In response, Ryan was clearly annoyed. \"If only people understood\
  \ the culture of others before making swath generalizations! You have no right to\
  \ judge an entire group of people from your privileged American standards...\" Initially\
  \ I was seething. Why does general compassion have to be a \"privileged, American\"\
  \ thing? The separation from human and animal should be dictated by compassion and\
  \ intelligence, a Universal Good found throughout every culture."
