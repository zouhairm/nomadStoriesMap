Text: "\u201CWhat made you change your mind?\u201D asks Ryan with a smirk on his face.\
  \ As the gusting wind messed my hair, I reply saying \u201CWell, I figured you wouldn\u2019\
  t have gotten anywhere in this city with a New York style of hailing a taxi.\u201D\
  \n\nMy initial plan for the day was to spend some time by myself at Marine Drive,\
  \ a boulevard which stares out into the vast sea, listen to the sound of the splashing\
  \ waves hitting the stone tripods, ponder over the universe and later attend my\
  \ university lectures. On my way I bumped into Ryan, who was of a 22 year old hot\
  \ mess with maps and \u2018Things to do in Mumbai\u2019 lists. \u201CCan you please\
  \ help me out? I am a little lost\u201D, an innocent voice with a heavy American\
  \ accent pleaded.\n\nSuppressing my social anxiety, Ryan and I had a conversation\
  \ about how he is on an exploring trip to India and Mumbai was his first stop. As\
  \ I was sorting out his not so well planned itinerary, he asked me whether I could\
  \ accompany him but sensing my hesitance, he didn\u2019t push the idea. \u201CI\
  \ guess I could spend the day exploring my home\u201D, I blurted out, surprising\
  \ myself like never before.\n \n\u201CDon\u2019t over analyze your decisions. Best\
  \ stories come from adventures which aren\u2019t intensively planned.\u201D Ryan\
  \ said, getting me back to this unforeseen reality.\n\nOur first clich\xE9d tourist\
  \ spot was the Gateway of India. As we walked towards the monument, making our way\
  \ through the flock of people admiring the slightly worn off monument, I realized\
  \ how breathtakingly grand the structure is. The central dome was maintained and\
  \ delicately designed while the four turrets were sheer architectural brilliance.\
  \ It faced the sea which had ferries ready to take people for a ride across and\
  \ if you looked far enough, you could see ships anchored at certain spots. Adjacent\
  \ was a heritage hotel of Mumbai, the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel. It stood tall, with\
  \ its European styled architecture, looking magnificent.\n\nAs Ryan was capturing\
  \ these details and basking in the beauty, I noticed a flight of pigeons munching\
  \ on raw maize. \u201CIt\u2019s time to pretend like we are in a Bollywood movie.\
  \ Start recording\u201D, I said grabbing his hand.\n\nWe ran amidst the pigeons\
  \ which created chaos as the poor startled birds started flying in all directions.\
  \ As we turned back, we were laughing and jumping at the sight of people bumping\
  \ into each other and the pigeons flying up high. And that is when I realized that\
  \ this day, as surreal and impromptu it was, will be a better experience than to\
  \ attend class on a Tuesday morning."
