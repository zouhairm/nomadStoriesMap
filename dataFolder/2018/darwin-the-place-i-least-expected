Text: "Darwin (Dah-win), NT, Australia is one of the corners of the Earth, a place\
  \ even Australians find strange. However, it will forever be the place I first tasted\
  \ Tim Tams, heard the incredible story of the Australian Aborigines, saw saltwater\
  \ crocodiles in true form, and learned how genuine friendship can span continents.\
  \ To the east of Darwin is a land of incredible creatures and mythical landscapes.\
  \ While wandering the forests of Kakadu National Park, you can easily imagine the\
  \ Dreaming, or Aboriginal creation stories, which tell how the world came to be.\
  \ You begin to realize why the land is so important to its people, who have over\
  \ 600 languages and distinct systems of living. Stripped of more than just the dirt,\
  \ but of their sacred sites, Aborigines have been pushed to the cities, where misfortune\
  \ envelopes them, stereotypes abound, and obscurity threatens. \nDuring my time\
  \ in Darwin, five or so friends and I would skip down to the empty beach (well,\
  \ besides a nudist here and there) to think up our adventures. Uluru was one of\
  \ these, and we set off with only one Australian who knew how to drive on the right\
  \ (and by that, I mean left) side of the road. Sarah, queen of the Tim Tams, Casey,\
  \ said Australian, Rita, plagued by midges, Andrew, from St. Louis and a total ham,\
  \ and myself. Since we were all sleeping in the van, each night we would \u201C\
  air our grievances\u201D which I\u2019m sure any therapist would say is ridiculous.\
  \ Flies, emus, and meat pies plagued us. We rolled through Alice Springs like we\
  \ were on fire, trying to get to the rock before the campsite closed. The Aborigines\
  \ are the rightful owners of Uluru, and ask you not to climb it out of respect.\
  \ It is a sacred site, and besides, those who climb it are sometimes blown off the\
  \ top (yes, you drove three days to the only rock in a big desert you can\u2019\
  t climb! We made it just in time for sunset, and what a sight, deep red rock rising\
  \ out of the Earth as if it were a large, sleeping animal, a natural monument along\
  \ a songline we couldn\u2019t see, but could feel. Despite the beautiful view, on\
  \ the way home, every Wicked van we passed thought we were waving encouragement,\
  \ but we were actually screaming \u201Cturn around!\u201D. The characters made my\
  \ stay in Darwin more than memorable, and many of us stay in touch to this day.\
  \ My footprints may have washed away in the sand on those vast, empty beaches, and\
  \ my smile may no longer greet the regulars at The Groove Caf\xE9, but Darwin will\
  \ forever be the place I least expected."
