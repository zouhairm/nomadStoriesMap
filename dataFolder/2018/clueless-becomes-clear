Text: "Peeling off my abnormally large purple headphones, I\u2019m assaulted by the\
  \ airport. It beats down on me with announcement, badly covered music and self-important\
  \ conversations. These announcements always given in that \u2018this is important\u2019\
  \ voice that never comes through clearly. I find my way over to a row of faux timber\
  \ benches by a window where the rays of the sun meet the edge of one, my bags dragging\
  \ themselves behind me. This seat that my back end occupies belongs to a nearby\
  \ cafe. \n\nIced espresso arrives in a whiskey tumbler. It's bitter, bitter sweet\
  \ almost. \n\nThe coffee shop fills. Some collared shirts with laptop bags, carrying\
  \ people inside. Smelling jet fuel being propelled out of the fast moving engines.\
  \ At times it is chaotic. The air is thinning as more and more people arrive and\
  \ depart. There is an overwhelming atmosphere of emotions.\n\nDipping my toes in\
  \ the afternoon sun, reminiscing over the time spent running my fingers through\
  \ the fine sands of the Portuguese coast. With the drying salt still remained resting\
  \ on each delicate hair above my eyes. It's undoubtedly going to be 20 degrees cooler\
  \ than the current temperature my body resides in. My sun kissed skin and wavy curls\
  \ are not ready to jump on board the train that is reality.\n\nAbout 8 hours ago,\
  \ I had been profusely perspiring alongside a friend on a rail so slow I could see\
  \ a tailless lizard walking ahead of the nonchalant wheels of the train. Why did\
  \ I feel the need for rush?\nA rush back to the city that I have not only gained\
  \ so much from taking residence in, but a place that has taken so much from me.\
  \ It\u2019s robbed me of my money, my sanity, my positivity and sometimes I felt\
  \ even my humanity. The city that is a place for people to escape the small mindedness\
  \ in which they come from. Free to do and not bound to the expectations of what\
  \ they should be. Everyone expresses themselves differently there, and as time quickly\
  \ passes and the chains of society begin to loosen. This is what I hoped for. \n\
  \nAn unfamiliar feeling runs down the back of my spine. Uncertainty. \nThe unfillable\
  \ void in my heart. Is it the lost time out of my family members lives, the endless\
  \ banter between lifelong friends and the skin crisping heat waves I\u2019m missing\
  \ out on, that I\u2019m only being reminded of now, a year later. Is this the mental\
  \ reasoning behind me being dragged back to the motherland limb by limb."
