Text: "\u2018You\u2019re visiting N\u2019Awlins at a good time,\u2019 says our amiable\
  \ tour guide, Andrew, dressed entirely in white linen and a Panama hat, \u2018The\
  \ music is better than ever and... well, we might not be here much longer.\u2019\
  \n\nWe\u2019ve been standing at the open doorway of a deserted cafe on North Rampart\
  \ Street for about an hour, hearing sordid tales about William Faulkner and jazz\
  \ cats on nearby Frenchman Street, now drowned out by deep rolls of thunder and\
  \ wailing sirens as a thousand buckets are emptied from the sky. Along the gushing\
  \ river of a road, two hysterical men row by in a kayak, one dressed in only a thong.\n\
  \n\u2018How often does this happen?\u2019 I ask Andrew, as we stare out at the street,\
  \ water lapping rhythmically at our feet. \u2018The flood,\u2019 I add, as the thonged\
  \ man floats by with a grin and an off-balance wave.\n\u2018In summer, every one\
  \ or two weeks.\u2019 He laughs at the familiarity of his response, before rolling\
  \ up the ends of his linen trousers and removing his polished brogues, stopping\
  \ only briefly to consider the risk of contracting tetanus, and wading towards his\
  \ car through the urban stream.\n\n'It's a weather city,' Andrew declares as he\
  \ drops me to safety at a cafe in the French Quarter, 'this is our nature.'\n\n\
  News soon floats in to this barefooted refuge via the angry faces of local residents\
  \ appearing on a nearby screen: this is the worst flood since Hurricane Katrina.\n\
  \u2018How do people prepare for the floods?\u2019 I had innocently asked Andrew\
  \ as we cruised slowly down drenched French streets in his humming motor.\n\u2018\
  They don\u2019t prepare. They just deal with it.\u2019\n\nEverywhere in New Orleans\
  \ people still talk about the devastation caused by Katrina 12 years ago: about\
  \ where they were, what it took from them, and how their community rebuilt itself\
  \ over the following years. The levy is never far away: the huge, ominous concrete\
  \ slab that surrounds this party paradise, at once protecting and foreboding; this\
  \ bowl of humid joy, its fragile edges so close to bursting.\n\nI return to my hostel\
  \ that evening on foot, after all public transport has ground to a halt, swimming\
  \ the final stretch through five feet of murky water. The following afternoon I\
  \ would be parading down the same street on which our tour never really began, surrounded\
  \ by second-line brass bands, dancing and shaking among hordes of dripping torsos\
  \ in the scorching sunshine, as if there had never been a flood at all. In the city\
  \ that rebuilds and reconvenes, there is never an end to the party, even at the\
  \ hardest times."
