Text: "My lifelong dream is to be a jungle dweller. Never am I as happy as when I\u2019\
  m knee deep in foliage, dirt smeared across my face, scaling trees and chasing furry\
  \ little creatures. Volunteering to save the giant sea turtles in Costa Rica was\
  \ an opportunity for me to live out my jungle fantasy.\nTo help their plight, volunteers\
  \ patrol the beach each night for laying Leatherback Sea Turtles. Once discovered,\
  \ the eggs are taken back to camp where they can be safeguarded until hatching day.\
  \ Patrols were done in teams with a Spanish guide as the leader. One such guide\
  \ was Carlos, a card counting ex-poacher with three yellow teeth and a cackle like\
  \ a Disney witch. Once I saw him wipe the table down with the cat. \nOne night,\
  \ Carlos and myself were the only ones on patrol as resources were stretched thin.\
  \ We set off as normal along the beach. Carlos in front, silent aside from the occasional\
  \ indecipherable babble to the dog. I was off in my thoughts, no doubt setting the\
  \ world to rights. About an hour into the walk a group of ten to twelve heavily\
  \ armed men came storming out of the jungle towards us shouting in Spanish. They\
  \ were dressed in black carrying machine guns with ammunition belts around their\
  \ waists, yelling. Surrounding us, an aggressive back-and-forth between them and\
  \ a very nervous Carlos followed during which I tried my best to become invisible,\
  \ cowering behind him. The traitor turned and motioned for me to go with the men.\
  \ 'VAMOS' Carlos was sacrificing me to save himself. I tried to refuse or at the\
  \ very least, convince Carlos to come with me but he flatly refused, backing towards\
  \ the water as quick as his legs would carry him. With very little options and my\
  \ heart in my throat, I allowed the men to march me from the beach deep into the\
  \ jungle, my pleasant thoughts replaced by the feeling that this could possibly\
  \ be the last patrol I would be doing. I thought of my Mum back in Australia, and\
  \ how I had neglected to mention this particular trip. After what felt like hours,\
  \ the trees thinned and we came into a clearing in the jungle, more heavily armed\
  \ men stood in a perfect circle. No one spoke. In the centre of the circle stood\
  \ a skinny man with a blindfold on. I wondered when my blindfold was going to materialize\
  \ and I would join the man in the centre to meet my fate. One of the armed men marched\
  \ me into the circle and handed me a heavy bag full of turtle eggs. Turns out the\
  \ police are team Turtle! With a lesson learnt, I skipped back to find Carlos."
