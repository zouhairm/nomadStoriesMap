Text: "A passenger clutched his camera tightly, whilst another failed to light his\
  \ cigarette in the wind. The intoxicating revolutionary colours which welcomed me\
  \ at the port fell into the periphery of my vision as I stared at the towering twin\
  \ peaks of Ometepe. The volcanoes, Concepci\xF3n and Maderas, mothered their surrounding\
  \ wildlife on isolated land held by a body of uplifting blue water. I had entered\
  \ a majestic world within a world\nsince spontaneously crossing the border from\
  \ Costa Rica to Nicaragua. \nLater, I passed a cacophony of sound whilst cycling\
  \ from the port Moyogalpa along the periphery of the island to San Jos\xE9 del Sur:\
  \ a deserted runway, ominous volcano evacuation signs, simple towns with children\
  \ who fell over and laughed sweetly at me. When the relentless thunderstorm hit\
  \ unexpectedly, their smiles spurred me to continue and embrace the natural wonder\
  \ of the falling water and intermittent flashes. The thunder echoed their tranquillity.\
  \ \n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D, the old edentulous man croaked in Spanish as\
  \ I sat in the Le\xF3n dusk a few weeks later, recovering from the day\u2019s volcano\
  \ boarding. \u201CThis is your home. Es tu casa, tu casa!\u201D, he exclaimed, as\
  \ he gestured towards the sight in front of my eyes. Every day since arriving from\
  \ Ometepe, I had come to Plaza Mayor at 5pm when the bells chimed. Gleeful children\
  \ leapt from school into the safe square. El Sesteo, the bar in the corner of the\
  \ square, welcomed passers-by for a to\xF1a beer while the bright white lions of\
  \ the Baroque Cathedral gazed exaltedly on the reflecting red light.  Birds swerved\
  \ across the scarlet sky, and peace rang through every corner of the vibrant city.\
  \ \nA veteran FSLN member gave enthusiastic tours, vividly recalling how he helped\
  \ to overthrow the dictatorship in 1979. Modernist poet Ruben Dar\xEDo's work could\
  \ be heard from the University and his colonial-style home, now a museum. Just around\
  \ the corner, the contemporary art of the Ortiz-Gurdian Museum glowed. The food\
  \ market swayed and children played basketball in front of bright street art depicting\
  \ heroes of the past.  The ocean crashed on the sands of Las Pe\xF1itas beach just\
  \ outside the city. Art, revolution, colour and peace intertwined. \n\u201CKnow\
  \ that you always have a home here, you are always welcome here\u201D, the English\
  \ School Owner said to me after I volunteered to teach a lesson. Nicaragua is beautiful,\
  \ and its welcoming people are even more so. I went to Nicaragua unexpectedly, and\
  \ I found a life-changing second home."
