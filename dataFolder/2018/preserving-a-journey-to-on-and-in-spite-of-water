  \ my sister anxiously whispered. \n\nIt was 7:10am on the Rio Sucuri. We had been\
  \ furiously and asynchronously paddling upstream from our coveted spot at the front\
  \ of the canoe for an entire 10 minutes. Our suffocatingly small, rented wetsuits\
  \ were giving us a comical range of motion akin to wooden dolls, and had our guide\
  \ known how fragile we were feeling that morning, he would have understood how distraught\
  \ we were to get those seats of honor in the swaying vessel. \n\nI glanced sideways\
  \ at my sister, and nearly laughed out loud - in part because my own stomach was\
  \ in a delicate quivering state, and because the rest of the upbeat tour group was\
  \ oblivious to our struggle, chattering away about underwater photography and the\
  \ far-strewn countries they had journeyed from to be there that tropically tepid\
  \ morning. \n\nOur own underwater photography equipment had been left behind by\
  \ our guide, so it appeared that the other important part of the trip - the part\
  \ where my sister and I would document one of eco-tourism\u2019s greatest preservation\
  \ successes, and in the process preserve evidence of our having been there - was\
  \ not going to go as planned either.   \n\nLike us, the rest of the tour group was\
  \ going to be snorkeling back down this famed serene stretch of radiantly translucent\
  \ emerald water an hour later.  Unlike us, they were not in fear of imperiling the\
  \ Rio Sucuri\u2019s renowned crystalline water preservation efforts because of upset\
  \ stomachs from a picanha feast gone wrong. They would also be able to take a small,\
  \ digital piece of the natural wonder with them.\n\nWe had adhered to strict guidelines\
  \ against using anything that could contaminate this enchantingly translucent river\
  \ (including lotions and sunblock!) and yet there we were - potentially about to\
  \ contaminate it. \n\nWe had planned, a great meticulous plan two years in the making.\
  \ \n\nWe had trekked, a two-week adventure across the country.\n\nWe had made the\
  \ Rio Sucuri the pinnacle of our sister travels, a place we dreamt of documenting.\n\
  \nThe last thing we expected was to nearly undo the preserving we revered, in our\
  \ efforts to witness it. \n\nThe last thing we expected was to plan a trip around\
  \ documenting a natural wonder and leave without any physical or digital evidence\
  \ of ever having been there. \n\nAnd the last thing we expected was to look back\
  \ on that trip and realize that it will live on as our best preserved trip, the\
  \ only evidence of it existing in our memories."
