Text: "Some one truly said that planned things never happened on time, things always\
  \ come to us when we least expected them, my trip to RAJASTHAN was one of an unexpected\
  \ experience for me. Being so fond of travelling but never expected any of my trip\
  \ so unplanned. It was our session break at the exact same time last year we were\
  \ planning a trip for a long period of time,but some how i wasn't interested or\
  \ you can say i was forced to not to take a trip and instead focus on my studies\
  \ and take up a part time job. But as the sayings go what you seek is seeking you\
  \ . Some how I convinced my parents to let me go and it was an hour or so before\
  \ the trip that i was confirmed of going.\_\nWe planned a 4 days trip to JODHPUR\
  \ and JAISELMER\_\nJodhpur is a city in the Thar Desert of the northwest Indian\
  \ state of Rajasthan. Its 15th-century Mehrangarh Fort is a former palace that\u2019\
  s now a museum, displaying weapons, paintings and elaborate royal palanquins (sedan\
  \ chairs). Set on on a rocky outcrop, the fort overlooks the walled city, where\
  \ many buildings are painted the city\u2019s iconic shade of blue.though it was\
  \ long journey still we weren't that much tired, we got fresh and started our day\
  \ in a local market\nAt night we were searching for some night life in JODHPUR where\
  \ we got to know that it indeed has one and only club \"ON THE ROCKS\" which was\
  \ hardly 10 minutes away from our hotel. If i have rate this club it would no doubt\
  \ would be 9/10 in ambience music menu and other things as well.\nbut the only loophole\
  \ in this club is that it only open till 11pm so you have to put a pause to your\
  \ happy feet and come back soon to enjoy a funk of Bollywood EDM night.Other attraction\
  \ in JODHPUR can be THE MEHRANGARH FORT an epidome of power and royalty can be easily\
  \ seen at this place you can see various local performances in the fort premises,\
  \ there's a museum providing us the knowledge of the equipments used during battles,\
  \ the costumes they used, the utensils they used etc.This fort also have a refreshment\
  \ lounge for you to take a break and enjoy for a bit.\nThe next day we went to JAISELMER.\
  \ The scenes were an eye candy. We went back to our tents which was way beautiful\
  \ than we imagined, we chilled and enjoyed for the time being, but every good thing\
  \ had to come to an end so do our trip, the next day we all were bidding farewell\
  \ to our one of the best trips ever. AND THAT'S HOW MY FRIENDS OUR UNEXPECTED JOURNEY\
  \ HAPPENED"
