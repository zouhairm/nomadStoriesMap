Text: "\u201CBizarre travel plans are dancing lessons from God\u201D said Kurt Vonnegut.\
  \  Here I was at the edge of a cliff, thoughts flying through my head at a million\
  \ miles per hour.  Could I trust a stranger?  We speak different languages.  Should\
  \ I fly?   Would I be dancing with destiny?  \nOur long-anticipated trip had finally\
  \ arrived \u2013 well, almost!  The first leg of our journey had begun.  Adventure\
  \ always held my fascination, but would I be up to the call?  \nWe were in the \u201C\
  City of Kings,\u201D gawking at the Convento De San Francisco, with its Spanish\
  \ Baroque Architecture and Mudejar designs.  On the UNESCO World Heritage list,\
  \ this Monastery and Church is in the historic centre of Lima.   In contrast to\
  \ the grandeur of its majestic fa\xE7ade, are the dark catacombs.  Crawling to enter,\
  \ you looked down at deep wells containing bones arranged in eerie, geometric designs.\
  \  The city\u2019s heart is steeped in myth, and according to legend these bones\
  \ once belonged to people who lived during the Spanish Inquisition.  Fear almost\
  \ prevented me from going in, till our local friend Tiago mentioned it was a \u201C\
  must see\u201D to understand the history of the people.   \nThis experience was\
  \ only the beginning.  Our trip to Machu Picchu was short lived, as flights to Cusco\
  \ were cancelled due to bad weather.  Hours of waiting at the airport, hoping the\
  \ Weather Gods would bestow mercy, but to no avail.  Disappointment engulfed us.\
  \  Until a local passenger seated nearby said a prayer under his breath and mentioned\
  \ \u201CGod has been kind.  You will only make it to the mountain when the mountain\
  \ calls.\u201D  The next day, news headlines stated there were landslides.   \n\
  As with Life, plans occasionally take unexpected turns.  We started exploring Lima\
  \ with renewed zeal.  At the Larco Museum we travelled through historic Inca and\
  \ Nazca lines with their spellbinding collections of erotic art.  We experienced\
  \ the joys of Peruvian cocktails and cuisine - Pisco Sours, Ceviche, Octopus and\
  \ exotic flavours outside our comfort zone; encountering new sensations and tastes.\
  \ \nAfter a satisfying Sunday brunch, walking along the Green Coast at Miraflores,\
  \ we saw awe inspiring cliffs and paragliders in a perfect sky.  A paragliding instructor\
  \ approached and asked me if I wanted to go tandem paragliding.  Would I be up to\
  \ the call?  The quiet voice within me whispered - bizarre travel plans are flying\
  \ lessons from God!  \u201CYes\u201D I said\u2013 and before I knew it, my feet\
  \ were off the ground, and we were soaring \u2013 on Wings and a Prayer!"
