Text: 'Would like to share a travelling experience of Bhutan as a story.The majestic
  peaks,the colourful flags,the rythmic chanting.Bhutan has taught me patience,how
  to search for happiness within ourselves,how to be a better person.And there I met
  a wonderful person,assigned to us as the so called "driver" from the Tourism Agency.I
  call him "Bhaiya"(In India "Bhaiya" is "Brother" ).When we go to a new place we
  think of so many things.The first thing he said when he met was."Now forget all
  your worries and enjoy the coming 5 days".He owned every hiccup of the trip.He was
  a localite and understood me very well.I went with my parents,both aged above 50.He
  took total care of them as well.He stopped at all small places which were not mentioned
  in the itinerary,made us familiar to the biodiversity of the place,the flora and
  fauna,the wildlife.We had local cuisines,enjoyed local drinks.And the foremost was
  that there was a trek in Bhutan called the Taktsang at Paro,popularly known as the
  Tiger''s nest.The monastery hangs on a precarious cliff at 3120metres(10,240 ft)  above
  the Paro Chu(in Bhutan ''Chu'' it means River or water).Since my parents were uncomfortable
  to let me go alone,Bhaiya went with me. At one point I was giving up on the trek,
  then he made me sit down and understand the history of the place.He depicted me
  the story and told you will feel fantastic when you reach there. I saw the glaze
  in his eyes, the power of extremity.

  I already climbed for 1 and a half hour  and he told it would take the same effort
  to climb down as you need to be careful with the slippery muddy tracks.If you have
  come half the way why not cover the full.

  His enthusiasm helped me think again and decided to proceed.Made it in 3 hours.And
  trust me it was spectacular. At the end of the trip he gifted me a the traditional
  Buddhist wheel.I still miss Bhutan...:( Sometimes I feel I am a hell lot of emotional...but
  then I think its ok.

  Bhaiya still tells me hows the weather there,whether its snowing or its a bright
  sunny day.There was a huge  statue of Buddha 169 ft(52 m) called as Great buddha
  Dordenma.Felt some attachment with it at the first look,you can say love at first
  glance,lovingly called him Buddha Jee("Jee" shows respect).Bhaiya also gives me
  update about my Buddha Jee,replying he is good asking how are you.When I am depressed
  he sends me Buddha Jee''s pic and says "All izz well" and not to worry.

  Probably we will never meet again but still we will be in touch for ever.'
