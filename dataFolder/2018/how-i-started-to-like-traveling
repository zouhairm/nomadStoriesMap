Text: I have spent whole of my childhood in a closed family where travelling outside
  /venturing out of homes for girls are a big no no...... I belong to a middle class
  family so our budget also didn't allow us to do so too..... After finishing school
  from a local government school I had to come out of my cocoon n travel to other
  district, Assam to be precise which was an herculean task for me as my parents /mom
  as my dad expired when I was at class 10,was not educated n we have no other close
  family to guide me through and as I had two more younger siblings who needed attention
  she could not accompany me....... So I had to do it......... Out of necessity ,leave
  my comfort zone n venture outside all alone tonight face the world, to guwahati
  To give entrance exam..... Once I stepped out of home n started to see the outside
  world something inside me changed... I wanted to explore more, to see more, to live
  truly......i went to guwahati n stayed there for two days n I had seen everything
  for the first time... The different cultures, good habits, tradition n I promised
  to self together make it a habit.... To live my life to the fullest, travel more,
  learn more, see more.............
