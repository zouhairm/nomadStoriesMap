Text: "\u201CWhy did I have to go and travel on my own?\u201D These words resounded\
  \ in my head as I stared outside the window of the flat I was renting in Botafogo\
  \ on that morning of March. I had arrived in Rio too late the previous night to\
  \ notice what the Cidade Maravilhosa had in store for me. Across the misted up window,\
  \ all I could see was a blurred, familiar shape of what I imagined was the Sugarloaf\
  \ Mountain at the mouth of Guanabara Bay. The rest was all rain: ubiquitous drops\
  \ of water to accompany me in my first solo adventure.\nThe purpose of this trip\
  \ was very clear from its very inception: being an utterly social animal, back in\
  \ London I was making the most of all the stimuli and interactions with people from\
  \ all over the world which such a vibrant metropolis can offer. I needed a challenge.\
  \ A break. A way out of my comfort zone. Time and space to facilitate a journey\
  \ of self-discovery. For all these reasons, the idea of visiting Brazil and Argentina\
  \ for four weeks quickly took shape in my head and, in a matter of weeks, I requested\
  \ holidays work and sorted the flight tickets and accommodation. I was ready to\
  \ set sail to South America!\nStaying in Botafogo was a clear option for me. This\
  \ unpretentious, working-class neighborhood seemed to check all my boxes: it was\
  \ off the beaten path, safe and (relatively) close to other must-sees in the city,\
  \ like Ipanema or Copacabana. Another driving factor, of course, was its price:\
  \ I knew of this place through a friend\u2019s friend, so for a modest one-bedroom\
  \ apartment for five days in Botafogo, I would be paying \u201Conly\u201D half of\
  \ my monthly rent in London. Quite an expense, yes, but considerably less pricey\
  \ than those in the touristy areas of the city. After all, it was March and Rio\u2019\
  s famous Carnaval was about to commence!\nSo I am sure that you, dear reader, will\
  \ now be able to sympathise with me: first morning, rainy day, far from the action,\
  \ having spent an arm and a leg in accommodation, travelling on my own for the first\
  \ time in my life\u2026 and without Internet access. If Abraham Maslow could reimagine\
  \ his hierarchy of needs for the 21st century, there is no doubt that WiFi would\
  \ be the base of it. Sadly, I had been foolish enough to take it for granted and,\
  \ what is more, also waited to be in Riuo to do all the research for my trip.\n\
  Facing this I was trapped inside a flat on a gloomy day, knowing no one in the city,\
  \ no possibility of finding out online what to do, there was just one thing I could\
  \ do: GO OUT AND EXPLORE.\n(TBC)"
