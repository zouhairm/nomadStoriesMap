Text: "\u201CI know where we can find a herd of elephants,\u201D Elijah told me one\
  \ day, \u201CIf you\u2019re ready for a hike.\u201D\n I had been living with Elijah\u2019\
  s family for a week in a house without electricity on the slope of Mount Meru, the\
  \ second highest mountain in Tanzania. We were in a small village, sixty minutes\
  \ from the nearby Arusha, a major northern city that bustled with safari tour agencies\
  \ and air-conditioned hotels. \n        Elijah had already fetched his machete from\
  \ the house.\n We set off.\n Late February is the dry season in Tanzania, and the\
  \ dirt road of the village had dehydrated into dust. Each step produced a cloud\
  \ of tan powder that rose up to my shins. As we walked, groups of barefoot children\
  \ ran beside us, shouting \u201CMzungu!\u201D at me.\n \u201CWhite people go to\
  \ the cities,\u201D Elijah said, \u201CYou\u2019re probably the first one they\u2019\
  ve seen.\u201D\n We walked until the dirt road ended at a line of tall trees. \n\
  \ \u201CNow we go into the bush,\u201D Elijah said, stepping into the forest. I\
  \ followed behind.\n Out of the intense, East African sun the temperature felt immediately\
  \ cooler. The soil was a dark brown color and my feet left imprints as I stepped.\
  \ The bush was densely packed with long, thin trees. Ahead I saw a middle-aged man\
  \ with a round stomach eating a banana and holding a machete in one hand. Elijah\
  \ approached him. They spoke briefly in a Maasai language.\n \u201CHe says the elephants\
  \ may be on the other side of this hill,\u201D Elijah explained.\n We walked up\
  \ a slope, through thicker soil, Elijah cutting down branches with his machete to\
  \ clear our way. At one point he turned left, and we followed a narrow path just\
  \ wide enough to place one foot at a time. Suddenly, he thrust his arm in front\
  \ of me. I stopped.\n Twenty feet away I could see a gray baboon perched on a tree\
  \ branch, its eyes fixed on us. It stood there on all fours, unmoving. Excited,\
  \ I lifted my camera and snapped a photo. As the shutter clicked, the baboon let\
  \ out a high-pitched cry. A second later, deep growls came from the trees surrounding\
  \ us, dozens of furious baboons hidden behind the leaves.\n I ran.\n Racing down\
  \ the narrow slope, I sprinted until Elijah put his hand on my shoulder and said,\
  \ \u201CWe are OK now.\u201D\n We squatted, panting, and Elijah checked his watch.\n\
  \ \u201CShould we leave?\u201D he asked.\n Through the treetops I could see the\
  \ sun dropping. A rare breeze passed through my hair. I listened as the African\
  \ bush sang the noisy songs of birds and insects, obscuring whatever else was hidden\
  \ from view.\n \u201CLet\u2019s go,\u201D I said."
