Text: "I had traveled from Ado-Ekiti to visit my family in Lokoja that year.\nWeeks\
  \ after, I was on my way to an evening Islamic school where I'd agreed to help teach\
  \ the kids pro bono when these two young girls saw me. I didnt see them at first\
  \ because I was lost in thoughts. Taking the bushy shortcut, which was one of the\
  \ many paths that led to the Islamic school, was a random choice that day. The bushy\
  \ passage afforded me the luxury of seeing fresh green leaves, green mountains and\
  \ the birds flying below the cloud. \n\"Brother, will you please help us with the\
  \ woods,\" the girl in a long red dress said. Her partner was dressed in an orange\
  \ top, and a white, black-striped skirt.  I said okay. She was tying entwined ropes\
  \ on the heavy woods. I waited. They chatted while they prepared the woods. I noticed\
  \ that their eyes were not on the woods: their eyes were on each other with a timid\
  \ smile, as though discussing something both funny and secretive. Mechanically,\
  \ their hands moved in tying the woods as though they would perfectly tie and untie\
  \ the logs of firewood even if they were blind. This knowledge revealed to me that\
  \ they had done this many times. I asked what they intend to do with the logs of\
  \ firewood. \nThey both said, \"We intend to sell it sir.\" \n>>\nIn the evening,\
  \ listening to Queens Bohemian Rhapsody, I would look at the pictures I had taken\
  \ of these girls, these two firewood sellers, and remembered helping the girls to\
  \ balance their woods on their heads. I remembered the heaviness of the firewood,\
  \ the way they had struggled to keep it from falling, the way their laughter had\
  \ vanished as the firewood rested on their heads. I remembered the laughter that\
  \ came before and the growing silence until I lost sight of them. We didnt say goodbye.\
  \ Here, in Lokoja, goodbyes were kept for the dead. I remembered that the last thing\
  \ they said was -thank you, brother. \nMy encounter with the firewood sellers didnt\
  \ last for more than fifteen minutes, but it was as though it had come with a memory\
  \ that could last for a lifetime. \nI never saw them again. I threaded that bushy\
  \ passage many times after, hoping that I might see them again, and asked about\
  \ their work, their story, their wellbeing and their future. Our meeting was a happenstance\
  \ made possible through luck, it gave me a story of memory, a memory of two teenagers,\
  \ two firewood sellers, two Nigerian girls, who amidst the hardship of life, struggled\
  \ to survive in the paltry earnings that the firewood could provide."
