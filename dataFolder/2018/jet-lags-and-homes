Text: "Jet lag swept all over me as I tried my hardest to stay up in a caf\xE9 in\
  \ Turkey. I was with my best friend Umut and his group of friends in bouts of backgammon\
  \ or tavla, and peach-flavored hookah. Tea or \u04ABay was served along with a few\
  \ bottles of locally brewed beer. But despite the fun of it all, I found myself\
  \ in a bad state of wakefulness. And when I couldn\u2019t take it any longer, pulled\
  \ out of my chair and darted out into the open shores of downtown Ku\u015Fadas\u0131\
  .\nPeople were basking in the warmth of the sunset. I strolled along the cobblestone\
  \ path, the waves of mighty Aegean resonantly crashing into the rock-lined shores\
  \ compelling me to start a conversation with. So I asked him why I was there. And\
  \ though I knew he heard me, he said nothing.\nOne vendor waved me over and smiled\
  \ offering roasted chestnuts and simit, her stall filling the chilly air with a\
  \ toasty, almost savory smell.  Smiling back, I paid for my treats and said, sagol,\
  \ kolay gelsin as though I said this out of habit. It meant thank you and may it\
  \ come easy. \nSleepiness started to retreat as I mulled over memories of the past\
  \ few days. This was a trip I agreed to on impulse the moment Umut asked me to come\
  \ to Turkey four months back in Wisconsin where we got to know each other working\
  \ at a snack bar. I knew to myself it was now or never. Arriving to Turkey, I was\
  \ welcomed with a bounty at the warmth of a Turkish home, and to new customs I was\
  \ taught to practice \u2013 all of which I openly embraced as a new part of me.\
  \ Especially tea-drinking! The reminiscence made me glad, a bashful chuckle coming\
  \ out of me.\nApproaching a fishing spot, a man was staring at me so I said merhaba,\
  \ nas\u0131ls\u0131n which translates to hello, how are you. I realized he took\
  \ notice of my camera and so asked me to take a picture of him and his catch. Sure,\
  \ I told him, took his portrait and sent it back immediately to his phone. It obviously\
  \ made him very happy. I stood there with him as we watched the sun go down.\nEnergized,\
  \ I made my way back to the caf\xE9 quickly realizing why I was there yet again,\
  \ mighty Aegean evidently grinning in the background. Like every recent trip I took,\
  \ each just made me true local by heart knowing how keen I was in adapting to new\
  \ cultures.\nAs I entered the caf\xE9, Umut asked me where I have been, the anxious\
  \ look on his face telling me it was time to go home. Home, yes, home! Of the things\
  \ I can find in Ku\u015Fadas\u0131, I think I found yet another place I can call\
  \ home."
