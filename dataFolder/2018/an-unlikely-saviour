Text: "We are sitting on a tree trunk next to a small campfire. Our group\u2019s tents\
  \ are spread all over a green plateau. A guide is sitting in front of me telling\
  \ tales about people who take something from the woods that doesn\u2019t belong\
  \ to them and never find their way back out. The forest appears to them as a human\
  \ and gives them wrong directions leading them deeper into the woods. Just to be\
  \ safe I put back the blossom that I ripped off a flower earlier.\nThe next day\
  \ we walk down to the waterfall that shall be our last stop before taking a bus\
  \ back to the village of Estel\xED. We are in a remote nature reserve in the north\
  \ of Nicaragua called Cerro Quiabuc-Las Brisas. There are no people for miles, no\
  \ cell phone reception and the little paths that lead our way change from year to\
  \ year. Our guide is having trouble recognizing them and many times we have to stop\
  \ or change our direction. Guided tours in Nicaragua are usually very routine but\
  \ the tours to Quiabuc-Las Brisas are rare and when they take place, time will have\
  \ taken its toll on the nature reserve to make the once clear paths unrecognizable.\
  \ When we reach the waterfall, our group has been split up many times. It is worth\
  \ it though, reaching the clear blue water after the breath-taking view over the\
  \ landscape cladded with volcanos from one of the highest spots of Quiabuc-Las Brisas.\
  \ Me and one of the guides walk up to the street where we will catch the bus a little\
  \ while before the rest of the group does. The plan is for the others to catch up\
  \ in time to get on the bus together. But when we reach the street there\u2019s\
  \ still no one to be seen on the trail behind us. \u201CThey will be here soon\u201D\
  , the guide says. But they do not appear. The last bus passes but my guide insists\
  \ on waiting for the group. The street gets darker and darker. We are alone. Two\
  \ women in the dark on a dusty road. Sometimes cars drive by but there are only\
  \ men inside of them sometimes whistling or catcalling us. Going back is not an\
  \ option. The guide is getting rather nervous and she finally agrees to walk down\
  \ the street in lack of a better idea.\nIt is very quiet. Until we suddenly hear\
  \ the patter of hooves coming closer. A thin horse comes up from behind us, with\
  \ a young woman sitting on it and her child right behind her with his arms wrapped\
  \ around her waist. She stops next to us and after explaining our situation to her\
  \ she smiles and invites us to stay with her. I think of the blossom I put back\
  \ the day before. I\u2019m glad I did."
