Text: "Mist rose from the river as it is not uncommon in Seville just before dawn\
  \ at the beginning of spring, intertwining with the twigs of the trees that showed\
  \ their new leaves. A lady was walking with quick strides along the road with one\
  \ of the typical, colourful, magical dress tightening her hips.  \n\n I was getting\
  \ home after the first day of Feria de Abril, but I had not the keys of my apartment,\
  \ so I hoped my friend had got home before of me. Spain is pretty full of \"ferias\"\
  \ throughout the country, but Seville's \"Feria de Abril\" is the biggest, the most\
  \ visited and undoubtedly the most interesting. Characteristic of every feria is\
  \ eating, dancing and drinking together. In Ferias there are a lot of structures\
  \ in wood ( called casetas) that in other cities are open to anybody but in Seville,\
  \ except for the public \"casetas\" the most of the casetas are private so you are\
  \ allowed to join a private one only on invitation. And there are a lot: like a\
  \ big block inside the city there are hundreds of these ephemeral houses, used only\
  \ for a week in a year. That morning I had found myself under a strong sun, with\
  \ horses going around, with people in suits and ladies with their Traje de Flamenco.\
  \  \n\n Every caseta has got its peculiar characteristics depending on the taste\
  \ of the owner: from the colours of the curtains to the kind of food provided, the\
  \ tables, the mirrors, the pictures on the wall. Luckly for me, if you are friend\
  \ of an invited friend you can have the opportunity to access to a private caseta\
  \ and the owners are usually delighted to show their skills, tastes and traditions\
  \ to foreigners.  So I had the opportunity to visit a pair of them: we started dancing\
  \ and drinking.\n\nThe heels of the lady seemed to fail to support her gait: perhaps\
  \ she had drunk too much, like me. She turned the corner, so did I. On a stair in\
  \ the little road we found two guys flirting, they too in their suits. The lady\
  \ did not seem to care about them at all, while she was going on, tottering. At\
  \ last the expected happened: one heel broke down and the lady was falling, I went\
  \ on to help her. She almost in her sixties and thanked me with a broad smile. She\
  \ only told me: \"Feria? Guiri?\" As I was answering, I heard a voice telling me:\
  \ \"Hey, what are you doing here?\" I realised that one of the men on the stair\
  \ was my friend with the keys.  Somebody had told me that spring festivals in Seville,\
  \ with the air full of smell of jasmine and orange, kept an ancestral saviour of\
  \ love season."
