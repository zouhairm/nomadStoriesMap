Text: "It's impossible to imagine a trip where you do not have stories to tell.\n\
  \ In fact, as good as it is on a trip, is to be able to tell the adventures lived.\n\
  This trip very well depicts a decision that pushed me to the edge.\nIt was spring,\
  \ more precisely October, period of reforestation of the terrestrial flora. I can\
  \ consider the time of year when nature becomes more beautiful, more alive. It was\
  \ in this beautiful time of the year that I was surprised by a news that made me\
  \ a little upset, I was not selected for the next stages of a selective process\
  \ of internship for which I participated in the area of Animal Nutrition. I was\
  \ disappointed, because I was waiting for that opportunity a lot.\n It was then\
  \ that my counselor asked me if I would be interested in participating in a Congress\
  \ that would take place in Paran\xE1.\nAt first I did not arouse much interest in\
  \ the Congress, but later analyzing the content of the event and the sights seemed\
  \ an excellent opportunity. I'd never been on a plane, and that would be the opportunity.\n\
  \ It was then that I packed my bags and for the first time left my state, Minas\
  \ Gerais, I took the flight and went to Curitiba / PR. That sense of freedom from\
  \ being inside the plane opened up my field of vision.\n I arrived in Curitiba and\
  \ went to do a city tour, in the morning I met the Oscar Niemeyer Museum, the afternoon,\
  \ the Botanical Garden and the next day the Egyptian Museum and Rosicrucian.\nBeing\
  \ in Paran\xE1, I could not miss the Iguazu Falls, so I arranged to go and meet\
  \ her the next day. I organized a group of people and went, in a van. It took a\
  \ lot to get, but it was compensatory.\nThe Iguazu National Park has a peculiar\
  \ nature and the Cataratas can say that it washed my soul, being underneath and\
  \ feeling the waterfall was a unique sensation. In addition to listening to the\
  \ melody of the birds sounded like a relaxing hymn.\nWe left the Park better than\
  \ we entered with regard to feelings of inner peace.\nCongress ended and on returning\
  \ to Minas Gerais next to my armchair on the plane was a great businessman in the\
  \ area of Veterinary Microbiology. Which opened space for me to talk about my career,\
  \ my perspectives.\nHe was interested in extending my hand.\nI can consider that\
  \ this trip was a starting point for my career as a microbiologist. Sometimes this\
  \ is what we need in our lives."
