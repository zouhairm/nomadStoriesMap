Text: "The cries sent Sarah to her knees, her arms outreached wide, and her eyes begging\
  \ for the puppy to come near. It ran into her embrace, its body trembling as Sarah\
  \ picked it up from the dusty road and cradled it in the security of her arms.\u201C\
  It\u2019s okay,\u201D Sarah cooed. My heart fell as I looked at the golden Baladi\u2014\
  a native Egyptian breed. Her fur plastered in the sticky tar substance that covered\
  \ popular streets in Dahab, she burrowed into Sarah\u2019s chest, nervous and thin.\
  \ Sarah\u2019s eyes wavered between hurt and rage as we approached the restaurant\
  \ the dog ran from to speak with the owner. \u201CShe was adopted by the people\
  \ who live there,\u201D Maria, the manager at El Dorado Restaurant, explained, pointing\
  \ across the road to a large door. \u201CThey kicked her out because she was eating\
  \ the grass.\u201D Abandoned, the Baladi found a temporary home at the restaurant,\
  \ but still, employees there abused her. It wasn\u2019t until 2014 that the Bedouins\
  \ began taking in dogs as pets, but it was still custom in Egypt for dogs to be\
  \ abused, abandoned, and even poisoned. They weren\u2019t seen as loved ones or\
  \ a part of the family, and the concept was a hard one to swallow. As Sarah coddled\
  \ the Baladi, Maria called Karin, a weathered German woman who runs the local Animal\
  \ Welfare, to give the Baladi a better home. We joined Karin in her beat-up Subaru\
  \ to bring the Baladi back to the sanctuary, kicking up dust behind us as we traveled\
  \ down side roads to an old sewage plant towered by desert mountains, seemingly\
  \ hidden from Dahab\u2019s bustling city center. Wagging tails and loving nuzzles\
  \ greeted us as we climbed into the makeshift enclosure, relief washing over us\
  \ to see such happy dogs. Hours passed, a hum of another Muslim prayer wafting in\
  \ the air, as we played with the dogs and learned of Karin\u2019s inspirational\
  \ work with Animal Welfare Dahab. With help from volunteers and the local vet, Dr.\
  \ Amira Nabil, Karin is able to provide dogs with a safe place to grow, while also\
  \ applying TNR (Trap-Neuter-Return), a safer method to control the stray population.\
  \ Continually spreading awareness and compassion for animal care in Dahab\u2019\
  s community, Karin is making a gradual positive change that left Sarah and I with\
  \ a great feeling of hope for these animals. It only took four days to get the supplies\
  \ and paperwork in order, and with the extensive help from Karin and Dr. Amira Nabil,\
  \ Sarah and I safely brought the Baladi\u2014a happy puppy named Rey\u2014back home\
  \ with us to live with Sarah\u2019s sister in Connecticut, USA."
