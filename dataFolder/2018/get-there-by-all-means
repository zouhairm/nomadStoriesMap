Text: "One day you find yourself climbing up to 5600 m on Kalapathar when you need\
  \ to stop every 5 steps to breath, your chlorinated water has been long ago frozen\
  \ as well as done your toes and face as nothing protects you enough against this\
  \ penetrating wind and cloudy cold. You cant catch your thoughts as last 5 days\
  \ you could not fall asleep in your no-doubt- comfortable sleeping bag,- at this\
  \ moment you ask yourself only one question- how come you are here.\nI knew my perfect\
  \ way to the canteen \u2013 leaving the office on the right there are 3 stairs,\
  \ long corridor, turn right and straight ahead to the canteen. I was thinking about\
  \ that way on the 5th day of eating plain rice namely I was thinking of it as of\
  \ my desirable way to the variety of food. In front of the 10th plate of plain rice\
  \ in a row the perspective to let you surprise by the variety of office canteen\
  \ food was literally fantastic.\nIn the mountains you can hike, enjoy the picturesque\
  \ landscape and meditate. Something like that you can read in the travelling flyers.\
  \ It might be true about mountains, it is blatant lie about Himalayas. If you can\
  \ survive, it is your success story already. They say the more hopeless your goal\
  \ is, the deeper emotions are.  You know It is great happiness just to open the\
  \ eyes after the night you were discussing with Eli Goldratt the importance of looking\
  \ at Socrates through Epicure works. I checked in the morning Goldratt died in 2011.\
  \ You may call me boring, but to feel alive after hallucinations is the deepest\
  \ emotion I have ever had. Your hopeless goal in these mountains is to survive no\
  \ other thoughts are available.\n3 stairs, long corridor, turn right and straight\
  \ ahead. Going this way you can think about everything. You can think about your\
  \ chasing dreams. After all if you dare to dream, dare to ask yourself why it is\
  \ not your goal yet. Let surprise yourself by the variety of canteen dishes and\
  \ enjoy your life lunch. \nEdmund Hillary was the first man summited the top of\
  \ the world. Success is unstable thing, which comes and goes, many achievements\
  \ are done because of being in the right place on the right time. History made by\
  \ Hillary was not by chance. First, it was a dream, then it was a goal. 3 stairs,\
  \ long corridor, turn right and straight ahead make your life comfortable to think.\
  \ To think how to let your dreams come true.\nOne day you find yourself climbing\
  \ up at 5400 m to 5600 m on Kalapathar, when you know where you want to be and how\
  \ to get there. By all means."
