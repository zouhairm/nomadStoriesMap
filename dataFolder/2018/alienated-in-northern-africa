Text: "A couple of years ago I visited Rabat, the capital of Morocco. What I didn\u2019\
  t foresee, was that I would have to completely surrender to trusting a local. I\
  \ had never been to Northern Africa before. In fact, I had never really left Europe.\
  \ I arrived late in the afternoon, rented a car and drove towards the central district\
  \ of Medina. Medina, as I was soon to find out, is one of the poorest neighborhoods\
  \ of Rabat. When I finally parked my car, night had fallen, and I still had to find\
  \ my hotel.\n\nI walked over to a friendly-looking elderly man \u2013 he seemed\
  \ to be the car park security guard \u2013 to ask for directions. The man immediately\
  \ nodded and walked off; inviting me to follow him. I felt unprepared, barely speaking\
  \ French, let alone Arabic. Being aware there was no internet connection that would\
  \ point me in the right direction, I took a deep breath as I decided to let this\
  \ man lead the way. My instinct told me that this area was one in which to keep\
  \ moving; not one in which to appear lost after dark.\n\nThe first thing I noticed\
  \ were the high stone walls, narrow alleys and lack of windows. I later found out\
  \ that the windows weren\u2019t absent, but merely invisible \u2013 they were placed\
  \ high up in the walls, and covered with bars, to keep burglars and robbers away.\
  \ The high walls also prevented the burning sun from turning houses into ovens mid-summer.\
  \ During summer months, Rabat could reach temperatures of 50 degrees.\n\nWandering\
  \ through Medina, just before midnight, felt like being lost in a labyrinth. Corner\
  \ after corner, we passed unlit lane-ways, small groups of men gazing at us. I felt\
  \ prejudgments rising within me. What if this man has bad intentions? What if I\
  \ get robbed or worse? Anything could happen without leaving a trace. I suddenly\
  \ felt some comfort in my decision to cover my hair using a scarf, aware of visiting\
  \ an Islamic country.\n\nI shifted from focusing on risks to allowing a feeling\
  \ of astonishment arise. There was a continuous rush of newness and, ironically,\
  \ oldness. A Muslim passed by wearing a long, dark coat, and carrying an oil lamp\
  \ on his way home. More than anything, this walk felt like an adventure in medieval\
  \ times. After what seemed to last forever, we had entered the hotel, to which the\
  \ man had brought me safely. He asked me to wait, as he would get change for the\
  \ parking fee I paid him. He came back as promised and kindly wished me good night.\
  \ With a sense of relief, I went from feeling vigilant to feeling heartwarmingly\
  \ welcomed."
