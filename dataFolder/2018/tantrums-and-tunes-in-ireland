Text: "I think I must be the only person in living memory to have ridden a bicycle\
  \ anticlockwise around Ireland. Certainly the only Australian woman, of mature years,\
  \ on her own, on a bike, attempting her first cycling adventure. What was I thinking?\
  \ \n\nOne morning, I peered out the window of my B&B to see the wind mercilessly\
  \ bending the tree branches, but I figured, as I planned to stick to the twisting\
  \ and changing coastline that day, I would eventually enjoy a tail wind. But, No.\
  \ North, South, East, and West, regardless of the direction, I copped the full force\
  \ of the headwind. At one stage I even had to pedal hard to inch my way DOWNHILL!\n\
  \nBy 2pm I was wet, cold, and exhausted, and after throwing a very major, non-adult\
  \ tantrum in the middle of the wilds of Ireland, I decided that the next B&B I saw\
  \ \u2013 that was it! I was staying there regardless of the price.\n\nA Fawlty-Towers-style\
  \ sign with a sideways lean directed me up a rough dirt road. In a foul temper,\
  \ I pointed that unmentionable bicycle in the direction of a small, plain house\
  \ sitting isolated in the bare and blasted landscape.\n\nI knocked on the door.\
  \ No answer.\nI knocked on the door again. No answer.\nI twisted the door knob and\
  \ the door opened. \u201CHello, hello\u201D, I called. Still no answer.\nI called\
  \ again, waited, and then owing to the remnants of my tantrum, invited myself in\
  \ and strode determinedly up the hallway.\n\nA little grey-haired lady, as wide\
  \ as she was tall, bustled through the door, took one look at me and in a broad\
  \ Irish accent said \u201Cyou must be frozen stiff\u201D and proceeded to drag me\
  \ into her lounge room and in front of the crackling fire.\n\nTearing my eyes away\
  \ from the fire, I looked up startled as the lounge room walls were covered in large\
  \ gold records. From floor to ceiling, disks glimmered and glinted in the firelight.\
  \ \n\nIt was the last thing I expected to see.\n\nUnbeknown to me I had invited\
  \ myself into the ancestral home of the Irish music legends Enya and Clannad and\
  \ here, before my unbelieving eyes, was the evidence of their musical success. Before\
  \ arriving in Ireland, I had overdosed on all things Irish, including the music,\
  \ and here I was in the presence of Irish music royalty. \n\nWho would have thought\
  \ that the wilds of Donegal would hide such abundance?\n\nI passed a warm and relaxing\
  \ night as that cursed wind belted around the outside of the house. \n\nRestored,\
  \ I rode off into the gentle morning mist, humming a very off-key Orinoco Flow.\
  \ \n\nPerhaps I should throw tantrums more often."
