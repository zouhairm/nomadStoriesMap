Text: "Mina nestles her back against a coconut palm, facing the distant islands as\
  \ the tide ebbs out from Hua Hin. She rests her sketchpad across her lap. Her thick\
  \ black hair falls forward onto the paper and she casually flips it behind her shoulder.\
  \ Again it slithers forward. Immersed in her work, she seems oblivious. Splashing\
  \ watercolours here and there, Mina appears to be painting a scene. I wriggle down\
  \ onto the sand beside her. \"Tum arai, na kha?\" I question. Mina replies that\
  \ this is a painting of special significance. It represents her new way of being\
  \ and that I am not to question any further until it is done. I agree.\n\nWe met\
  \ just a few days before on the rickety boat to Monkey Island. After, we sailed\
  \ to Phraya Nakhon Cave - a destination that offered brief respite from the heat\
  \ in the vast, damp chambers beneath steep cliffs. Mina had been quiet along the\
  \ paths, but several times I glimpsed an innocent smile that belied the sadness\
  \ in her dark, almond eyes.\n\nI had known her French mother in Bangkok as an exchange\
  \ student. Gaia had fallen in love with a Thai soldier and remained there to establish\
  \ a life together. Like several of my other friends, they had adopted orphaned Thai\
  \ children in the 90's. \n\nDuring dinner, Gaia and I chat. Her fascination for\
  \ my work with disadvantaged children is humbling. Gaia quietly confides the challenges\
  \ she faces with her children. \"They found Mina under a bridge - in a shopping\
  \ bag,\" she whispers, tears spilling from her eyes, \"and my son beside the road.\"\
  \ My eyes fill too, with tears for her pain and Mina's gut-wrenching beginnings.\
  \ We hug and our discussion transcends into one of deep understanding as I enlighten\
  \ her with the psychology behind her children's unpredictable outbursts. We agree\
  \ to explore this more deeply another time. \n\nAs we leave the restaurant, Mina\
  \ emerges from the darkness, bearing a rolled parchment tied with ribbon. \"My gift,\"\
  \ says the delighted child, beaming with pride as she passes it to me. Wrapped within\
  \ is Mina's seascape, with a woman bearing resemblance to me. The face of the woman\
  \ merges into distant rocks and her long, flowing hair creates a cave into the sea.\
  \ \"She is my protecting angel to make me safe,\" she explains. \"She is you.\"\
  \ We 'wai' courteously then embrace in a knowing hug. \"I will be a famous artist\
  \ when you come back soon,\" the little girl tells me in Thai, her eyes reaching\
  \ a place deep within my heart. \"No doubt, you will,\" I reply, as I silently pledge\
  \ to return soon."
