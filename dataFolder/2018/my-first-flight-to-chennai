Text: 'Hi.My name is Shubham.Actually i am not any frequent traveller,but i love to
  interact with new people and places.So here i am sharing one of my experience when
  i took my first ever flight to Chennai.My reason for going there was neither leisure
  nor any official business trip,actually i was having an exam at there.

  Before going to Chennai,I was having a lot of feelings,like as excitement,because
  it was my first ever flight journey as well as my visit to southern India,second
  one was fear of going to a place where very few would know your native language,but
  when i reached Chennai,it was different.Working in a BPO,where most of the people
  call from southern India,helped me a lot to interact with them easily.I enjoyed
  watching beautiful clouds and a top view of land from thousands of feets higher
  in the sky. I reached Chennai around 5''O clock in the evening.Meenabakkam Airport,Chennai
  was really beautiful,it was a difficult task for me select one more beautiful airport
  between Delhi and Chennai.

  After coming out of airport,i booked a cab to see my exam centre once.I was using
  online portals like Ola and Oyo very much,and all of them helped me a lot at there.

  I can''t forget that Ola cab driver,how sweet he was,by behaviour.He was not that
  much good in speaking english,but i had a lot of conversations with him while getting
  off to my exam centre.I also asked him about his driving experience,his native place,which
  was Madurai,and more especially his thoughts about north Indian food,which were
  not that much good.When we reached my exam centre,he and me,we both confirmed about
  my exam centre details and a good place to stay in night.I booked a hotel by Oyo
  rooms,hotel staff was very good by nature and their service as well.Next day i woke
  up early morning,took breakfast did a little revision for exam,then checked out
  from hotel,booked another Ola cab.and again that ola person was also really sweet,he
  also helped me to reached my exam centre 02.30 hrs before exam starting time .He
  also wished me goodluck & i happily thanked him for that.At exam centre i met two
  bangali brothers,in a very little time i discussed a lot of things with them about
  their culture,traditions & sports.

  After completing my exam i took a bus to Chennai Central,from where i was having
  my train to New Delhi.

  Only last thing i could expect from this visit to make this visit better with my
  friends,looking forward to have a trip to Chennai with them soon,we could have more
  fun together.

  Thank You!'
