Text: "\"I often see female hitchhikers on the road,\u201C Chris yelled over the noise\
  \ of the truck engine. \"Also in the night,\" he added and pointed to a dark shape\
  \ walking beside the interstate. He kept texting with his girlfriend and let me\
  \ know, how horny she was and that she thought we would have sex in his truck. Yet\
  \ it could have ended well, if we didn\u2019t blow a tire right afterwards. Here\
  \ we were, stuck at a truck stop only 20 minutes away from my hostel in Houston.\
  \ \u201ECome,\u201C he looked at me with the impertinence of a squatty 28 year old\
  \ ex GI and nodded towards his lap. \u201EC\u2019mon!\u201C \n\nI left the truck\
  \ mad and disappointed. On the parking lot, dozens of empty huge trucks stand still\
  \ in the moonlight. I could feel the stares of dark figures prowling on the other\
  \ side of the deserted area. I never thought in my life, that seeing the neon signs\
  \ of a McDonald\u2019s would ever make me that happy.\n\nBeing in a safe place again,\
  \ I started to realize that I will end up staying overnight in the McDonald\u2019\
  s, if no miracle happened soon. Then I saw an old lady who got picked up by a truck\
  \ driver. She had all her belongings in a trolley and let the driver help her to\
  \ get onto the car. If there were so many adventurous female hitchhikers, why don\u2019\
  t they write about it? \n\nI gathered all my courage and asked some customers who\
  \ were about to leave, if they could take me to Houston. Without any success. So\
  \ I decided to wait on the sidewalk in the glare of a street light. A car stopped,\
  \ a young man wanted to give me money. He thought I was a hobo, as in the US, hanging\
  \ around in the street makes you look like a homeless person. One hour later, another\
  \ guy picked me up because of my \"hobo appearance\". He was driving around to give\
  \ out beenies and hamburgers to homeless people. Kevin had an ingenuous smile. He\
  \ kept living in his car, although he could afford an apartment with his new job.\
  \ \u201EI was homeless for a year, now I want to give back.\u201C He stopped at\
  \ a bus station and we left a hamburger next to a sleeping hobo.  \n\nOnce a wise\
  \ woman said, the most essential indicator for your dream job is the shit sandwich.\
  \ You can only stand the hard work on the way to your goal, if you are willing to\
  \ eat the shit sandwich that comes along with it. If that\u2019s true, I should\
  \ become a professional traveller."
