Text: "\u201CIstria has two unexpected secrets,\u201D says my host. \u201COne above\
  \ ground; the other below.\u201D\n\nHave I noticed the pizzerias serving Boskarin,\
  \ Croatian cattle, with fusi pasta? Pula, with a Roman amphitheatre, or Rovinj,\
  \ also known as \u2018Little Venice\u2019? Or maybe the Italianised names of the\
  \ Croatian locals and the dual language road signs?  I may not have noticed the\
  \ abolition of Croatian schools and cultural institutions, or an empty stretch of\
  \ wilderness that used to be Istria\u2019s only natural lake until it was drained\
  \ for farmland. The first secret: Istria, a little known rural peninsula of only\
  \ 200,000 people, was subjected to Mussolini\u2019s fascist rule for 28 years. \
  \ \n\nThe other unexpected secret is currently being hunted down by my host\u2019\
  s three dogs. They trail ahead of us, nose to the ground, alert for a scent of a\
  \ precious fungi that sparkles on the dishes of wealthy foreign diners like the\
  \ diamonds around their necks. My host spends six months a year in Australia as\
  \ a car mechanic. During the summer months, however, he is drawn back irresistibly\
  \ to his homeland by the plentiful truffle crop.\n\nFrom the onset, there is nothing\
  \ special about these mismatched, scruffy mutts, but they are my host\u2019s livelihood,\
  \ truly man\u2019s best friend.  Truffle hunting is a lucrative business where a\
  \ kilogram of truffles is worth 3,000 dollars and the largest truffle was sold in\
  \ auction for 400,000. The rich, heady, and addictive taste of truffles of course\
  \ piles the pounds onto their value. However, it is also the precariousness of the\
  \ truffle\u2019s lifespan that makes them so sought after. Truffles spoil very quickly\
  \ and must be eaten within eight days of harvesting. Their value is also calculated\
  \ to the nearest .00 of a gram, like gold, so they must be sold in perfect condition\
  \ and be weighed without a speck of dirt.  \n\nThe dogs\u2019 ears prick up. Truffles?\
  \ Sadly not, just a rabbit, and as the shadows lengthen across Istria\u2019s parched\
  \ grassland and the mountains around us grow dusky, my host leads me and our motley\
  \ pack back home. When we return, my host\u2019s wife, with the expertise of a Cordon\
  \ Bleu chef, has rustled up venison goulash with grated truffles. Those wealthy\
  \ foodies don\u2019t know the true taste of truffles, she says, with their overpriced\
  \ dishes dashed with truffle oil concentrate. Try this, and you will never go back.\
  \ So when I eat that first mouthful, I know she is right. I will never forget the\
  \ taste of truffles, my welcoming hosts, and beautiful Istria, Croatia\u2019s hidden\
  \ gem."
