Text: "The bus stopped. I finally arrived at Morelia, a city I\u2019ve never been\
  \ to, in the centre of Mexico. I haven\u2019t checked on any map where the bus station\
  \ was. I haven\u2019t booked any hotel. It was 6 pm, I have arrived in the unknown\u2026\
  \n\nI got back my bag from the bus and disoriented, I stayed there, looking at the\
  \ people collecting their luggage.\n\nHe was standing among the crowd when I saw\
  \ him. I didn\u2019t know him. Sometimes, I speak to strangers, some people look\
  \ kind. When I see these people, I have an inner voice telling me \u201Cthis is\
  \ a good guy, talk to him\u201D.\n\u201CHi! I am Thuan. Do you know where is the\
  \ city centre? I\u2019d like to visit it.\u201D I started with my basic Spanish.\n\
  \u201CHi! Sure, you can take the combi over there and with the line 52 you directly\
  \ arrive at the city centre.\u201D He answered pointing at the exit. \nAs he realized\
  \ I wasn\u2019t sure about where to go, he continued:\n\u201CYou can come with me,\
  \ I am going there too.\u201D\nI was relieved. It\u2019s always a struggle to find\
  \ your way through public transport in a foreign city.\nWe walked to the bus stop\
  \ and waited for the combi. I have never heard this word before so I asked him what\
  \ it was.\n\u201CIt\u2019s like a small bus or a big car. Look, it\u2019s coming\u2026\
  \u201D He explained me.\nWhat a surprise to see a hippie van from the 70s coming\
  \ toward us.\nAs we entered in the combi my new friend started to question me:\n\
  \u201CWhere are you from\_?\u201D\n\u201CI am from France.\u201D\n\u201CReally?\
  \ But you don\u2019t look like French.\u201D He said probably referring to my tanned\
  \ face and my small eyes.\n\u201CI was born in Vietnam but I grew up in France.\u201D\
  \ I completed.\nWe continued introducing ourselves while the small bus was finding\
  \ its way through the busy streets of his hometown.\n\n\u201CLook! This is the cathedral\
  \ of Morelia, and here you can see the arches!\u201D He exclaimed, enthusiastic\
  \ to show me the monuments of the town. \u201CYou can get out here if you want,\
  \ so you can walk and have more time to enjoy the sights.\u201D He continued.\n\u201C\
  I didn\u2019t book any hotel. Do you think your family would agree to let me sleep\
  \ in their house? I have a sleeping bag, so I just need a space, not much...\u201D\
  \ I asked with an unsure voice.\n\u201CYes, of course. I am sure my uncle will agree,\
  \ they are very kind, muy buena onda.\u201D\n\nLater on, I met his uncle, his parents\
  \ and all his relatives. I even went at his sister\u2019s birthday and travelled\
  \ to a remote village with his cousins. He became my Mexican best friend and all\
  \ his family became my beloved Mexican family.\n\nKindness is all around when you\
  \ travel, just ask for it."
