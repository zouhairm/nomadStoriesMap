Text: "I was standing in front of the sliding glass doors in the exit immigration\
  \ center in the airport in Santiago, Chile.\n\nAnd my heart was breaking.\n\nMy\
  \ black coat was wrinkled and worn-a testament to my travels through four countries\
  \ over the past five months. While I tried to keep my face clear from the tears\
  \ streaming out of my eyes, everything around me faded into the background. The\
  \ modern cleanliness and white colored walls of the terminal played a serene contrast\
  \ to my frazzled emotions.\n\nCristian was in front of me trying to maintain his\
  \ composure, but I knew his heart was breaking too. Although we had only known each\
  \ other for three months, what we shared made our separation unbearable.  \n\nMy\
  \ mind went back to how our paths met. I was a patron in a small restaurant sitting\
  \ on the patio enjoying a Cuba Libre. He was my handsome waiter. Somehow, we ended\
  \ our night together dancing in a disco, starting our romance story.\n\nAttending\
  \ his restaurant\u2019s asado barbecue as his partner was intimidating. The attention\
  \ I drew to myself as the lone gringo was overwhelming for my meek personality.\
  \ My broken Spanish made my self-awareness that much stronger-but it didn\u2019\
  t matter. In romance, language barriers do not exist.\n\nIn the brief time that\
  \ we knew each other, we shared our stories. Cristian told me of his life-how he\
  \ lost his mother and made the journey-as most Chileans do-every November 1st to\
  \ lay flowers at her grave. I told him of life in the United States and my discontent\
  \ with my career. \n\nHe taught me the story of Chilean independence and the significance\
  \ of the festivities we experienced together in September. I taught him-badly-how\
  \ to say words in English. He showed me why Pisco is the best drink to enjoy when\
  \ dancing all night in Santiago.\n\nMost importantly, he showed me how to love again.\n\
  \nI arrived in Chile as a na\xEFve tourist fleeing responsibility and connections\
  \ at home. The culture of this small country and my time with Cristian instilled\
  \ within me a deep appreciation for valuing those closest to you-a lesson which\
  \ led me to my future husband several months later.\n\n\u201CHurry Chris. You\u2019\
  ll miss your plane.\u201D\n\nCristian\u2019s whisper in my ear as we embraced jolted\
  \ me back to the present. We wept together for what we were losing and what we knew:\
  \ We would never see each other again. Life goes on. I could not stay in Chile forever.\
  \ Grudgingly, I kissed Cristian goodbye and walked towards those sliding glass doors."
