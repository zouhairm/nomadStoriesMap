Text: "I craved to get away from all the noise.My main intention was to find the signal\
  \ that was long lost.Lost somewhere between routine,expectations,assumptions,stereotypes\
  \ and opinionated beliefs.The run from reality was slower than a speeding microorganism,it\
  \ was tough.But the possibility of undressing these socially designed layers was\
  \ worth the slow torture.And so I went to conquer Snowdon.\n \nAs I looked down,\
  \ my heartbeat increased.This is higher than I thought.I quickly backed up, took\
  \ a few deep breaths, lowered myself on my knees and crawled to the edge.Uncomfortable.I\
  \ sat down on the edge and introduced myself to rocks that have built and supported\
  \ this mountain.\u2019Every single one is important\u2019 I thought, no matter the\
  \ size, shape or location.\n \nI\u2019m experiencing natural ecstasy.Mountains in\
  \ front are steep,but all curved gently at the top.Drizzling onto the rocks, I could\
  \ hear silent waterfalls.\n \nIt is a sunny day.Earth must have caught the right\
  \ angle when orbiting the sun. The sun looks different up here. The sun is passionately\
  \ making out with this mountain.Tenderly kissing every spot.\n \nMy feet are hanging\
  \ out in the air, I can feel my pulse in my head, legs are in pain but the adrenalin\
  \ is blocking all the unpleasant receptors.On my right I could see the clear blue\
  \ lakes underneath, they looked like puddles from above. On the left I could participate\
  \ in a devoted dance with the clouds.The wind on top was strong enough to make me\
  \ tense my core.The skies were lit with clear, blazing blue, aflame with the turned\
  \ on sun. And here, in this very moment, I let it all go.I tuned out of the noise,\
  \ and found my signalling soul.\n \nHigh levels of oxygen,lakes,trees and mountains.No\
  \ mirrors,no sexism,racism,homophobia, transphobia,classism and all the other ways\
  \ we oppress, stigmatize and belittle one another down there.No deadlines, no urgency,\
  \ no stress, no clocks and no time.Reality?Reminder.Relief.Rare relationship.Lessons\
  \ hidden in every corner,every step,enveloped and wrapped up in nature.\n\nI closed\
  \ my two, usually judgmental eyes,used my backpack as a pillow and layed down.I\
  \ indulged in the intimate moment with nothingness.I didn\u2019t have long.I accepted\
  \ my breathless pauses,physical pain and emotional weaknesses that I became aware\
  \ of when climbing.I \u2018accepted control being absent in the hardest times\u2019\
  \ something I couldn\u2019t comprehend before.I successfully ran away from the noise.It\
  \ really was a decision that pushed me to the edge.Afterall,I learned how to accept."
