Text: "The night was cold and so was the bus, so I covered myself with the sleeping\
  \ bag. The road was dark, with no lampposts, and the houses were already sleeping.\
  \ Shortly before passing the border between Bolivia and Peru, the bus stopped in\
  \ a road check. Some young, either mestizos or indigenous, policemen came on board\
  \ to check passports. \nAn indigenous woman was hiding a box under her ample skirt,\
  \ so a policeman commanded her to show him the content of the box. \u201CThere is\
  \ nothing in here, sir,\u201D the woman said, her face betraying her anxiety. Her\
  \ two daughters sat next to her, one on the left and on on the right. They looked\
  \ scared. \u201CIf there is nothing in that box, why don't you show it to me?,\u201D\
  \ the policeman asked. He had understood that the woman was hiding something and\
  \ he wanted to know what that was. Then his chief arrived. \u201CMadam, you should\
  \ let us inspect that box, or we will have to bring you to a police station,\u201D\
  \ he said firmly. But the woman, her face now showing both fear and daring, said\
  \ again that there was nothing to check.  \nThen, the policeman pulled a box cutter\
  \ out of his pocket and threw himself to the floor with the intention of opening\
  \ that box. It was the chaos. The woman was screaming, invoking the Holy Virgin\
  \ and kicking the policeman. The cop, his head under the woman's skirt, was trying\
  \ to cut the box, while his colleagues fought to calm her down by blocking her arms\
  \ and legs. The two daughters screamed and cried and tried to liberate her from\
  \ the policemen. Then the woman screamed louder: \u201CHe cut my leg! He cut my\
  \ leg!\u201D. The young policeman reappeared from the woman's skirt and handed the\
  \ chief policeman his trophy: a case of CDs. The policemen then took the whole box\
  \ and left the bus, while the woman checked the wound on their leg. \u201CPlease\
  \ give me the CDs back, we are poor people,\u201D she kept saying. \nThe woman had\
  \ two other boxes which she had left in other parts of the bus, and the police knew\
  \ about it. So why did not they take them? Why did not they bring the smuggler to\
  \ the police station? I still do not know why, but that scene is still on my mind.\
  \ A viloent act perpetrated by a poor with a bit of authority towards a poor woman,\
  \ followed by and act of mercy by someone who knows what it means to be forced to\
  \ smuggle through a border false or stolen CDs in order to be able to feed someone's\
  \ family. \nThe bus rolled again in the peruvian night, and a few hours later we\
  \ arrived in Cuzco, the ancient capital of the Inca empire."
