Text: "Bass beats from a boom box reverberated down the swaying hallway of the ship,\
  \ carried by the breeze. A fraction of the vessel\u2019s passengers had assembled\
  \ in the frigid corridor, dressed incongruously in swimsuits, and nervous energy\
  \ buzzed amongst the crowd.\nI joined the end of the queue and cinched the bathrobe\
  \ sash tighter around my middle as I greeted my shipmates with an uneasy smile.\
  \ Understandably, they were anxious about jumping into the sub-zero waters of the\
  \ bay we were anchored in below the Antarctic Circle. I, on the other hand, was\
  \ more concerned about revealing my tankini-clad figure when my turn came to take\
  \ the plunge.\nBlessed with a long torso, I\u2019d been unable to find a one-piece\
  \ suit to fit me before I left home. Give me a solo trip through countries where\
  \ I don\u2019t speak the language any day! As long as I didn\u2019t have to reveal\
  \ my saggy, post-weight loss skin to join the adventure, I was in. However, I had\
  \ dreamed of this rare challenge from the first time I read about it. My fears and\
  \ goals were locked in an infuriating game of chicken.\nEveryone in line dealt with\
  \ their anticipation differently. Some laughed loudly, others jittered emotions\
  \ out through their limbs, some tapped on the handrail designed for use in the roaring\
  \ seas of the Drake Passage, while a few turned inward as they shuffled up to the\
  \ embarkation bay. I was one of the latter, only breaking my reverie for small talk\
  \ as our bare feet advanced along the sodden carpet.\nMy weight used to hold me\
  \ back from living my life. Countless kilos gone and it still had a grip on my mindset.\
  \ I watched the elated, steaming faces emerge from the inky depths and knew it could\
  \ be my fresh start. Screw self-pity. Forget imagined judgement. Each of us fought\
  \ our own battles to climb down those stark, metal steps and make a gutsy leap into\
  \ the unknown.\nDecision made, I stepped forward onto the rough, waterproofed decking\
  \ with my head held high and shed my terrycloth camouflage. I gasped as the staff\
  \ attached the thick, freezing safety harness around my belly, still dripping wet\
  \ from the last jumper. My legs shook as I clanged to the edge of the platform and\
  \ with a surge of adrenaline, I took flight.\nThe temperature shock lit every nerve\
  \ ending in my skin on fire and my rapidly numbing limbs struggled to drag me back\
  \ to safety. Back on the ship, I celebrated my new membership with a shot of vodka.\
  \ While we all began with different burdens, the liberating baptism of the Antarctic\
  \ waters united us."
