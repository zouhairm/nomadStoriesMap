Text: "I come from Coimbatore, a city in the southern most part of the Indian subcontinent,\
  \ known for its sweet drinking water,  perennial pleasant weather and a society\
  \ dominated by two major castes who have thrived within the limits of their demarcated\
  \ livelihoods for generations. However,  I belong to one such a thriving minority\
  \ who has had fortunate ancestry achieve the set social standards and only been\
  \ expected to keep it up. My childhood included weekend trips to the scenic country\
  \ sides. Eventually, academics took over; some of the road trip days were redeemed\
  \ with my parents\u2019 decision to give me my own car. \nFollowing graduation,\
  \ the period of indecisive uncertainty hits every individual with intermittent episodes\
  \ of anxiety. I spent most of my time locked in my room. Meanwhile, my mother had\
  \ suddenly housed an Indian origin British woman in our house, I was employed her\
  \ research assistant for part of her job was to travel around the belt in search\
  \ of tobacco plantations.\nShe had her ground work point towards this region, however,\
  \ the officials who had access to plantation records failed to acknowledge this.\
  \ A month went by reading poorly kept records and interviewing corrupt officials;\
  \ not a single farm was identified. \nWe finally had our first successful interview\
  \ with a farmer in weeks. They were an honest class of people, farmers. He gave\
  \ us leads to 3 major Tobacco hubs within this belt which produced 3 different types\
  \ of chewing tobacco. We traveled village to village gate crashing farmers, interviewing\
  \ them, taking a tour of their farms, taking samples of their produce, having fresh\
  \ tender coconut water from the trees in the farm sometimes even having a meal at\
  \ their homes.\nAt the end of the interviews we had a clear picture of the Tobacco\
  \ market.The ground level reality is far from what the world knows. The government\
  \ claims to have warning signs on packages but the village markets don\u2019t sell\
  \ packaged tobacco. The farming and laboring community are unaware of its risks.\
  \ While the health ministry has a treaty with the WHO, the ministry of trade and\
  \ agriculture are promoting its cultivation for economic interests. Much of these\
  \ findings are way beyond my scope.\nHowever,  I urged dental schools in the region\
  \ to hold awareness camps in these villages I have identified. I continue to work\
  \ towards eliminating, tobacco and oral cancer. A single travel experience has shaped\
  \ my career in a way I never imagined. It gave my life a mission."
