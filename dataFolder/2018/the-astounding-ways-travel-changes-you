Text: "We travel for a variety of reasons \u2013 to see far off places, meet new people,\
  \ feel sand between our toes, or simply to have something interesting on social\
  \ media (come on, we\u2019ve all done it).\nBut the greatest benefit of seeing the\
  \ world?  The way travel changes you like little else can.\nBeyond the pretty pictures\
  \ and the sun-kissed tan, you gain a perspective that stays with you long after\
  \ your bags are unpacked.  Here are just a few ways travel changes you.\n\nTRAVEL\
  \ TEACHES YOU VALUE\nOne of my favorite commercial campaigns of all time was for\
  \ Mastercard (and the spoofs were, well, \u201Cpriceless\u201D).  But the premise\
  \ was profoundly obvious \u2013 there are some things in life money can\u2019t buy.\n\
  In addition to priceless experiences, you also gain an appreciation for things that\
  \ are seemingly average in your everyday life.  Simple pleasures like air conditioning,\
  \ clean drinking water, easy communication, and elevators (which are sorely missed\
  \ when lugging 35 pounds of luggage up 9 flights of stairs).\n\nTRAVEL TURNS YOU\
  \ INTO A \u201CYES MAN\u201D\nIt starts by simply saying \u201Cyes\u201D to a trip.\
  \  Then before you know it, you\u2019re saying \u201Cyes\u201D to new foods, cultures,\
  \ and even adventures you\u2019ve only ever dreamed of!  \nClimb the Sydney Harbour\
  \ Bridge?  Why not!  Cage Dive with great white sharks?  They seem harmless enough.\n\
  You realize how good it feels to be open to new experiences.  And that openness\
  \ translates to looking for new opportunities in your everyday life.\n\nTRAVEL BURSTS\
  \ YOUR BUBBLE\nWe\u2019re all guilty of the 10-mile bubble.  That familiar little\
  \ area around our home that seems like our entire universe and nothing else exists.\n\
  But the world is so much bigger than our comfort zones.\nTravel teaches you that\
  \ our way of life isn\u2019t the only way of life.  There are other cultures, societies,\
  \ religions, and traditions which make up someone else\u2019s comfort zone, and\
  \ that\u2019s ok.  \nAnd, most importantly, you realize not everyone is as fortunate\
  \ as you.  To some, simple things like electricity, adequate food, and clean drinking\
  \ water are luxuries they\u2019ll never experience.\nYou see the world from a different\
  \ point of view, and that opens you up to accepting diversity and being grateful\
  \ for things you once took for granted.\n\nTravel is filled with experiences (often\
  \ unplanned) that make you grow in ways not possible through traditional education.\
  \  It pushes you, stretches you, and opens you up to so much more than you can imagine.\
  \  And it creates a lasting change that will stay with you forever."
