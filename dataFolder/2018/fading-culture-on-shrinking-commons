Text: "Hartingaram is leaving. Very soon he will not follow in the footsteps of his\
  \ ancestors. Though this Photo Feature is a story of resilience, he is a failure\
  \ \u2013 the barriers imposed on his lifestyle have been back breaking. From owning\
  \ and tending to more than 250 heads of sheep and goats, his flock has been reduced\
  \ to just 50. Rampant, uncontrolled thefts in a neighbouring state and a law and\
  \ order machinery that still considers transhumance is a destructive practice are\
  \ the immediate causes. Deeper is the severe injury to his self esteem \u2013 in\
  \ the eyes of his community which he had hoped to lead and prosper; in the eyes\
  \ of his wife; and mostly in the eyes of his children who, like all children felt\
  \ that their father is \u2018the best\u2019.\nBeing just 31, he sees a couple of\
  \ alternate livelihood options, though with trepidation. His family elders, however,\
  \ are afraid of any change and are likely to push on till it becomes unbearable;\
  \ till their backs are crushed by unsympathetic state policies that see no value\
  \ in pastoralism or its relevance to barren ecosystems. \nAre they really the flotsams\

  s father was when my friends from FES and I were surveying the Raikas around MP\
  \ to test out the possibility of getting associated with a group. That was on 9th\
  \ May 2013. At that time, he was a quiet observer and rarely intervened in the conversation.\
  \ His son Hertingaram did most of the talking while munim Nyamaji provided the assenting\
  \ notes! Thereafter, we have been meeting Lakaji quite often. He has always looked\
  \ to be in peak physical and mental health. He talked little but was and still is\
  \ full of wisdom.\nDuring our visit to his minuscule camp exactly two years later,\
  \ we were shocked to find him semi blind. He had been noticing deterioration in\
  \ his sight for a while but did nothing, waiting for things to improve on its own.\
  \ Gradually, however, it had become very difficult for him to herd the animals and\
  \ keep them away from cropped areas all around. So, he was tending to a few camels\
  \ (being big and visible) while the main Dera (camp) was some distance away. Yes,\
  \ he had been to many doctors who, besides offering no definite advice and giving\
  \ him an off-the-counter spectacle had ruled out any cure or \u2018moti\u2019 (cataract).\
  \ An active and healthy man had thus become a burden on himself and the family..."
