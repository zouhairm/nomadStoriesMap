Text: "Marseille revealed itself to me in the taste of a warm, doughy Chichi Fregis.\
  \ Disembarking from a boat in L\u2019\xC9staque, I walked the short distance along\
  \ the promenade to the regionally renowned Chez Magali, the food kiosk that has\
  \ become a rendezvous for residents. Emblazoned across the maroon stand, the words\
  \ \u201CV\xE9ritable r\xE9cette \xE0 l\u2019ancienne\u201D are a seal of approval.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHave you heard of me?\u201D\n\nThe vendor strikes up conversation as\
  \ I order \u2013 chichi with Nutella \u2013 while he fries the batter fresh. He\
  \ informs me the stall is famous thanks to a French cookery programme a few years\
  \ ago. The next day there were queues around the block. I tell him my host has recommended\
  \ this particular stand and he nods to the customers gathered around as though I\u2019\
  ve settled an earlier argument. The smell of batter hangs thick in the air.\n\n\
  This is a Marseille far removed from seedy stereotypes. Arriving into the Gare St-Charles\
  \ at the start of my trip, I had been faced with a billboard that demanded \u201C\
  Do you still listen to the old clich\xE9s about Marseille?\u201D\n\nIt is a pertinent\
  \ question. The Mediterranean port has long languished in its reputation as a dirty\
  \ and drug-fuelled destination. In 2016, France\u2019s second city made headlines\
  \ for football hooliganism and featured in Netflix\u2019s first original French\
  \ production, a show brimming with corrupt politicians, ganglands and sex scandals.\
  \ \n\nHowever, if one thing were to be gleamed from that series, it is that the\
  \ sweeping aerial shots of the sprawling metropolis are sublime enough to capture\
  \ the imagination. After I hiked to Notre Dame de la Garde, the basilica that overlooks\
  \ the port, it was clear the town has adopted a colour scheme; baked orange rooftops\
  \ and cracked umber house facades leant together along twisting streets. This city\
  \ makes no apologies for sidestepping sophisticated French urban planning.\n\nOn\
  \ the opposite quay, Le Panier is steeped in local traditions, shaped by the unrelenting\
  \ heat. Losing myself in the labyrinth that afternoon, I rediscovered a forgotten\
  \ France. Washing still dried on lines strung haphazardly between the homes; narrow\
  \ alleyways filled with the cries of the throaty Marseille accent; waiters clinking\
  \ glasses of Pastis in a heady haze of sweat and alcohol. You might sooner be in\
  \ an African medina.\n\nEven the Chateau d\u2019If, the prison from The Count of\
  \ Monte Cristo, is barely recognisable. Sat on its rocky island, the white tower\
  \ is now a welcoming beacon to a revitalised city mixing tradition and ambition."
