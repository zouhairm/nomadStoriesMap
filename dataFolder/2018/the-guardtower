Text: "I pressed my hands against the earth, reddish and chalky. Pressure down through\
  \ the base of my palms, to lessen the feelings of my lungs. My breath falling out\
  \ of me. Light on oxygen, I knelt toward the mountain. Nausea crawled from my stomach\
  \ to sway my brain. \n \u201CAnd who\u2019s idea was this?\u201D\nI saw her shadow\
  \ first, and arched my head toward the sound. A small dust cloud spun out of my\
  \ fingers as I released my hands. Slim, dressed in jogger\u2019s gear, deep crow-feet\u2019\
  s around her eyes, she said she walked the track regularly with her dog, who frolicked\
  \ as we spoke, skipping like a bird\u2019s flutter. \n\u201CSome folks take the\
  \ altitude hard, just keep drinking water. It\u2019ll help.\u201D  \nShe offered\
  \ me some of her water, which I gladly accepted. I stood up, amongst the enormity\
  \ of the Ponderosa trees, spread thick across the peaks of Santa Fe.\nWho\u2019\
  s idea was this? I had come to New Mexico alone. My host had mentioned Mount Atalaya,\
  \ a six mile out and back trail, at the edge of the Santa Fe National Forest. Mostly\
  \ uphill, she said. Take water. Be careful. So close to the sound and spelling of\
  \ my own name, the mountain had already taken me. \nWithin twenty minutes of beginning,\
  \ the road had fallen behind me, and the GPS signal on my phone disappeared. I noticed\
  \ everything, because it was so different from home; for winter, the land being\
  \ so dry, the little cacti that sprung up from the dust. I listened for rattlesnakes,\
  \ watched the sun cracking over pine needles.  \nEventually, when I told people\
  \ about my experience with altitude sickness, they asked, why didn\u2019t I just\
  \ climb down? The truth is, it never occurred to me. I had set out early, there\
  \ were people on the track. The danger was my body, ill adapted. Mount Atalaya soars\
  \ at an altitude of 9,121 feet; Wellington, New Zealand, the seaside city where\
  \ I was born and raised, has an altitude of 417 feet. \nAfter the dizziness hit\
  \ me, I could only walk five minutes at a time. Drink water, walk, kneel, rest,\
  \ repeat. The peak did not announce itself with splendor; no signs, just a plateau,\
  \ where I met a family who fed me strawberries. I was so grateful to have made it.\
  \ The city, small from that height, stretches out into the desert, your eye straining\
  \ into that flat, mysterious beyond. It was only later that I found Atalaya is the\
  \ Spanish word for Guardtower. Watching over Santa Fe. Watching over me. I don\u2019\
  t travel alone to be alone; by being alone in a world that is not mine, I find the\
  \ strength of my resolve."
