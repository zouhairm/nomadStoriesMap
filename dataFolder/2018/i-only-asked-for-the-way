Text: "When I came to Papua New Guinea the first time, I had been greeted with a \"\
  Welcome to Paradise!\". This third time, the customer officer in Port Moresby simply\
  \ tells me \"Welcome home, Lidia!\", before i head towards the Domestic terminal,\
  \ where my flight to New Ireland awaits me. \nWe have a six-hours stop in Kokopo,\
  \ in New Britain, and I want to see the volcanoes in the nearby city of Rabaul -\
  \ I only have to figure how to get there. Kokopo airport doesn't have an information\
  \ desk, only a small shop with some Cokes, bush biscuits and chewing-gums. I ask\
  \ the girl at the counter, and she tells me that the bus number 1 will bring me\
  \ directly to an observation platform, just outside Rabaul. I get on the bus - a\
  \ small minivan - and close my eyes. \n\"Hi, I come as well\". The girl from the\
  \ shop smiles at me as she gets on the bus and takes the sit next to mine. \"I think\
  \ it's better if someone comes with you\". I didn't expect taht, but I am not surprised.\
  \ In Papua New Guinea, strangers don't stay as such for a long time. She tells me\
  \ her name, Reina, and we agree on visiting the market first and then observation\
  \ platform, before coming back to the airport.\nIn the market, a wave of colours\
  \ engulfs us and I end up buying a huge bunch of bananas and some papayas, attracted\
  \ by the vivid yellow of their skin. Then, we start our hike up to the observation\
  \ platform - we decide not to take the bus. It's extremely hot, and the path very\
  \ steep - but Reina walks quickly while telling me her story. We chat in English,\
  \ sliding sometimes into Tok Pisin, the lingua franca of the country. She lives\
  \ in Kokopo, helps at the airport shop and her dream is to study History at the\
  \ University of Port Moresby. I tell her why I am currently staying in Papua New\
  \ Guinea, to write the grammar of a still undescribed language spoken in New Ireland.\
  \ Reina tries to remember whether she has any relatives in the village where I am\
  \ staying - her father comes from New Ireland, there is surely some cousin's cousin\
  \ who might stay in the vicinity. She already makes plans for my next visit to Kokopo:\
  \ next time, she promises, we'll hike the vocalnoes. The question, in our newly\
  \ born friendship, is not if: it's just when. \nTime, in Papua New Guinea, is a\
  \ relative concept; appointements are usually taken \"some time in the afternoon\"\
  ; \"some day this week\". Reina and I exchange phone numbers and agree on meeting\
  \ \"sometime next year\". No matter when exactly, she'll bring me to the volcano."
