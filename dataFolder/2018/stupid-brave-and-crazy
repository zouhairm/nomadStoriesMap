Text: "One year ago, I\u2019d made the decision to hike the Appalachian Trail.\n\n\
  Today is the day we begin our 2,200-mile trek, from Georgia all the way to Maine.\
  \ Today is the day I\u2019ve been anticipating for over a year - if only I had remembered\
  \ to eat breakfast.\n\nI was terrified. As I took those first few steps on the approach\
  \ trail my heart couldn\u2019t decide on a rhythm, sometimes pounding in my ears\
  \ drowning out the boys, sometimes so faint I thought I would pass out. I was hyperventilating\
  \ by the time my mom was out of sight.\n\nWhat was I thinking?\n\n\u201CWe can stop\
  \ here,\u201D I said, \u201CThis is our hike. No one says we can\u2019t stop here.\u201D\
  \n\nThe boys agreed and at barely 200 yards in to our 2,200-mile journey we stopped.\
  \ The four of us surrounded a picnic table and dropped our oversized packs.  We\
  \ pulled out protein bars unaware that in a few short weeks we would shudder every\
  \ time we so much as looked at them.\n\nIt was winter, but I was sweating already.\
  \ I took off my jacket and pushed up the sleeves on my thermal shirt. My backpack\
  \ was so full of gear I couldn\u2019t even shove in my jacket. After a moment, I\
  \ gave up and strapped it to the outside.\n\n\u201CWhy not put that in your backpack?\u201D\
  \ John asked.\n\n\u201CThere\u2019s no point, I might want it again,\u201D I said\
  \ instead of admitting that I had too much gear. I sat in silence listening to the\
  \ boys talk about the trail ahead. I only managed to eat a few bites of my protein\
  \ bar and tucked it into the hip pocket of my backpack for safe keeping.\n\nWith\
  \ my heartbeat nearly under control, breakfast in my stomach and trekking poles\
  \ in hand, I set out.   The boys would follow soon.\n\nOur first obstacle was the\
  \ stairs: 625 of them to be exact. The weather didn\u2019t help. It was too hot\
  \ to hike in any sort of a thermal layer but much too cold to be without one. When\
  \ the wind blew I wanted to stop and dig out my jacket. When the wind stopped sweat\
  \ immediately formed over my back and steam started to rise from my shoulders.\n\
  \nOn the stairs, the four of us stopped, we talked, we laughed, we drank water,\
  \ we walked, and wondered aloud when the stairs would ever end. By the time we made\
  \ it to the top we were almost a mile into our 2,200-mile journey.\n\nWhen we reached\
  \ the northern terminus of the Appalachian Trail six months later only two of us\
  \ remained. Standing on top of Mount Katahdin I knew my journey hadn\u2019t ended\
  \ yet (and not just because it was another 9 miles to the parking lot).\n\nAnd I\
  \ knew what I was thinking all those miles ago:  I was built for adventure!"
