Text: "\u201CWhy is she crying? Tell her to stop crying.\u201D \u201CWhy are you crying?\
  \ Stop crying?\u201D\nShe said it repeatedly; like a broken record. As my eyes wandered\
  \ the emergency room, I wondered how one would stop crying in here. If I wasn\u2019\
  t crying from the pain inside of me, it was because of the pain around me. I would\
  \ regain composure and then look to my right. Another person dying. Her skin dripped\
  \ from her body like wax drips off a candle. Warm and liquefied but slowly. The\
  \ heat in the room alone was enough to make me cry. The smell of decomposing bodies\
  \ at 100+ degrees Fahrenheit was enough to make me cry. The tears would stop, and\
  \ I could breathe again. But then I looked to my left. His skull smashed the same\
  \ way a ceramic coffee mug breaks when dropped. Half of it in large pieces, the\
  \ other half, shattered. I could see the inside of his skull but he didn\u2019t\
  \ know that. His face, pale, lifeless even though his arm were flailing, his jaw\
  \ was running, his eyes were dead. \n\nSomeone with all their skin ripped off, bleeding\
  \ out, someone with their skull so smashed, I could see inside, all the others crying\
  \ because they were in pain. But she wonders why I am crying. Was it nausea, the\
  \ fear, the heat? It was hotter than hell. No, wait, I was in hell.\n \nThis moment,\
  \ those moments, those weeks and months that followed were the last thing I expected\
  \ to happen when people said, \u201Cbe careful\u201D.\n\nEven though a week had\
  \ passed since the accident, that was the night it hit me. It was only after the\
  \ 9-hour ambulance ride through the back-dirt roads of Vietnam on a hot summer day\
  \ in that old humid ambulance with no pain medicine and driver drinking a 12 pack\
  \ that it hit me. But not before we spent hours begging for care, begging for help,\
  \ bargaining our small savings away for a hospital room. It was only after the rickety\
  \ elevator brought us to the 4th floor that smelt of must and mold that it hit me.\
  \ It wasn\u2019t until we opened the old, creaky door, and flicked on the one light\
  \ bulb, where the walls crawled. Cockroaches, bugs, ants, iguanas. I wheeled myself\
  \ to the bathroom, hoping to find some relief only to be greeted with a toilet seat\
  \ black as night, covered in ants. As I sat on the toilet, he pushed the beds together\
  \ to be away from the bug infested walls. He then picked up everything else in that\
  \ room and threw it with anger, holding back tears. It was only then, that it hit\
  \ me, that this was the very last thing I had expected. \n\nOne moment we were in\
  \ paradise. The next we were in hell."
