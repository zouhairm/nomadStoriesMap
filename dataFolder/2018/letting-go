Text: "\u201CI\u2019m sorry. I didn\u2019t know\u201D, says my cab driver as we take\
  \ the last turn towards Malvan, a tranquil beach 150 km from India\u2019s party\
  \ capital Goa.\nI was gazing absentmindedly at the silhouette of flying seagulls\
  \ against the magenta sky, squawking as they flew back to their nests. His sudden\
  \ words cut through my gloomy thoughts.\n\u201CAbout what?\u201D I ask surprised.\n\
  The briny smell of the air deepens, as do the shadows of dusk, as we move closer\
  \ to our destination.\n\u201CAbout your mom.\u201D\n\u201CIt\u2019s OK. I\u2019\
  ve moved on.\u201D I lie ignoring the morbid heavy sensation in my chest.\nDistant\
  \ sounds of crashing waves break the desolate silence that followed.\n\u201CWere\
  \ you close to her?\u201D\n\u201CVery.\u201D I reply pushing back a sudden rush\
  \ of overwhelming grief.\n\nIt has been 14 months since that fateful day. It shook\
  \ my whole existence, all emotions pushed from my being leaving a void so big it\
  \ can fit the entire ocean. In spite of constantly telling myself that I\u2019ve\
  \ moved on, a deeply unsettling feeling has held onto my heart, digging its talons\
  \ deep in my soul like a gull clutching onto a helpless fish.\n\n\u201CNow is not\
  \ the time to grieve,\u201D I tell myself trying to focus on the remote feeling\
  \ of excitement looming within. \u201CYou're about to see the ocean for the first\
  \ time.\u201D\nThe car halts. I feel an indistinct thrill. The next few minutes\
  \ pass in a blur.\n\nI am standing on the shore, mesmerized, gaping at the endless\
  \ expanse of shimmering red beneath an ember dome, illuminated by the scarlet glow\
  \ of the setting sun. An immense mound of incoming wave hits me. I panic a bit when\
  \ the water sweeps me off my feet with a soft force and then puts me gently down,\
  \ drenching me completely. The sand shifting beneath my feet tickles my sole. It\
  \ feels divine. I stand there letting the magical moment engulf me as the serene\
  \ darkness engulfs the last light of the day. Perhaps time has stopped.\n\nI am\
  \ lying on the wet sand, gazing up at the deep purple sky strewn with thousands\
  \ of tiny glittering diamonds. As I lay there a soft rush of warm water envelopes\
  \ my lower body.\n\u201CNo one ever truly goes away, child. They become a star and\
  \ watch over us.\u201D I remember my grandma used to say.\nI see a lone star twinkling\
  \ solemnly in a far corner of the sky. I smile at it while another wave blankets\
  \ me. As the warm water retreats down my chest, it sweeps something away with it.\
  \ I feel lighter. Liberated. A warm tear trickles down my temple, and I am hit by\
  \ an epiphany. I have finally let go of my grief. The ocean has indeed filled the\
  \ void."
