Text: "I was in London earlier this month for work. Like all work trips, this one\
  \ was packed as well with no time to explore the city. However, I decided to extend\
  \ my stay by a few days to travel around UK with my husband. After doing much research\
  \ on the places to visit, we decided on Windsor, Stonehenge & Salisbury. We booked\
  \ the tour and were all set to go. All was well until we received an email from\
  \ our tour operator a day prior to our departure saying they're unable to include\
  \ Salisbury in the itinerary due to lack of demand for it. The last thing I wanted,\
  \ after having worked really hard the entire week, was to have my travel plans wrecked\
  \ due to lack of demand. I could either take a full refund or join the tour to Bath\
  \ instead of Salisbury. I was really looking forward to visiting the Salisbury Cathedral\
  \ and seeing the Magna Carta. The thought of visiting Bath instead didn\u2019t excite\
  \ me at all. I googled Bath to see pictures of an old building with a pool containing\
  \ dirty water and felt all excitement leave my body. Like Bath was a dementor, sucking\
  \ every happy memory out of me.\n\nHowever, my husband forced me to sign us up for\
  \ Bath. Something is better than nothing, he said. How bad could it be? I agreed,\
  \ reluctantly. On 11 Feb, we started our journey from Stonehenge to Bath and I wasn\u2019\
  t the least bit enthused. But 45 minutes into the journey, something changed. As\
  \ we started the uphill drive to Bath, my interest levels started peaking. Lush\
  \ green hills, beautiful bridges, cloudy skies with dozens of hot air balloons &\
  \ the Avon River flowing by the side; Bath seemed to be a place straight out of\
  \ a fairytale. From the Pulteney Bridge to the Royal Crescent, from the Roman Baths\
  \ to the Abbey, from the world\u2019s best Cornish pasty to the most delicious fudge,\
  \ I was in love with Bath. I was running around in the cobbled streets with the\
  \ excitement of a child. I wanted to absorb as much of the city as I could before\
  \ we left. As if this wasn\u2019t enough, a snowflake landed on my nose. I looked\
  \ up to see hundreds of little snowflakes falling from the sky! For someone who\
  \ had never seen snow in my entire life, this was the highlight of my day. It was\
  \ literally the icing on the cake.\n\nImagine standing on the prettiest bridge that\
  \ you\u2019ve ever seen, looking at the river flowing underneath, surrounded by\
  \ beautiful Roman architecture while little fluffs of snow fall all around you.\
  \ That was Bath for me. The last thing I expected and the best thing that happened\
  \ to me."
