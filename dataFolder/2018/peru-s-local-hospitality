Text: "When the clouds slightly parted and the blue broke through the top of the Andes\
  \ mountains, the ancient civilization came alive. My neon pink sneakers contrasted\
  \ with the scene around me as I sat and took in the view. Multiple plane and train\
  \ rides and a rickety cab channeled me to this incredible point. With my mouth slightly\
  \ agape and my heart pounding from climbing hundreds of steps and in awe of the\
  \ world around me, I knew this would be a story I told for a lifetime.\n\nRiding\
  \ the high of viewing Machu Picchu, I hobbled to the hotel in a small town about\
  \ halfway between the Incan citadel and Cusco. Exhausted from traveling, thinning\
  \ air, and stairs I forced myself out into the town. Going with no expectations,\
  \ I wondered the town square and stumbled upon two adorable siblings. Both wore\
  \ knit caps and identical dimples that appeared as they followed me into a caf\xE8\
  . As we split a piece of cake, we spoke in broken Spanish. I learned how they each\
  \ were learning a trade from their parents. I learned that they weren\u2019t in\
  \ school, but what they dreamed.\n\nThe next day, I decided to take a hike through\
  \ more remote parts of the country. Armed with only the basics and printed out directions,\
  \ I headed out. I followed a sheep herder and passed an ancient ruin. Later, telling\
  \ myself I was only slightly lost, came a young man eager to practice English and\
  \ help me find my way. He enlisted the help of another local who used a giant machete\
  \ to lead us through the jungle. The short man with the long knife insisted on helping\
  \ us and asked nothing in return. \n\nSaying goodbye to the mountainous region of\
  \ Peru, I arrived back in Lima.As we approached the city's outskirts, I noticed\
  \ the contrast from other parts of Peru: amongst the sand duns hung laundry drying.\
  \ The parch landscape was quenched in pockets of gardens outside of colorful homes.\
  \ It was here I met Salem - a young child whose pride in his garden radiated from\
  \ his eyes under his floppy cap.\n\nI didn\u2019t travel to Peru to meet the people.\
  \ Sure, the backdrop of earthly bliss stands out: the white-caped mountains, ancient\
  \ sun temples, and mud colored buildings scattered among the green valleys and mountains.\
  \ But the people - the connection - is what fills my heart and makes my mouth slightly\
  \ agape. It wasn\u2019t just one person - it was the people and their willingness\
  \ to embrace each other and me as I wandered into their world. They are the stories\
  \ I will tell for a lifetime."
