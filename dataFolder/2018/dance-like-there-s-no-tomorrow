Text: "Wow. How the night turns. So true that 'We live for this moment because we\
  \ don't know the next.'  \n \nWhen the guys prowled forward with their 'Taxi...!'\
  \ calls, I said 'Si'. \n\nWalking into them, I said yes to them all, squaring up\
  \ and high with what happened. I argue five pesos with a bicycle taxi then feel\
  \ bad as he sweats en route. He'll get them, don't worry. \n \nI kept nearly getting\
  \ the giggles with the police, so young\u2013too young\u2013before I recall being\
  \ told: 'Do not play with Cuba. Do not.'  \n \nThe reality. How shoulders rise and\
  \ fall. And how the dancing becomes... It becomes...   \n \nThe GLEE of dancing\
  \ and being told by a local (trying to teach you and after you've said in frustration\
  \ 'Look, can I not just dance the way I want to, we'll still have fun'), that 'Yeah\u2013\
  now you got it. That's it!'! \n \nThis guy will spend a night in the cells for walking\
  \ me to a taxi. No explanations listened to. Not so funny. Here, this and the dancing\
  \ is soliciting. \n \nI paid the sweating driver, laughing at the pesos, and went\
  \ to left luggage. A jumper for the post-police chill. Through the empty office\
  \ a corridor led off and here, I swaggered in, finding a man at the back. He returned\
  \ my hearty 'buenas noches', pointing to a man on the floor, on his back, hands\
  \ behind head, behind tall metal shelves, trying to doze. We laughed and I greeted\
  \ the second with chat and a grin.  He didn't get up.  One man helping and another\
  \ one, laughing.  \n \nThe rucksack goes to front of house for the hour to departure,\
  \ with me giving the man the global, 'keep-an-eye-on-it' cue. He nods, then clicks\
  \ his tongue at me, with a quick thumb-flick to his lips. I laugh, sidle over. We\
  \ share a quick rum.  \n\nAn hour later, I get my bag from the man, echo the tongue-click,\
  \ thumb-flick and smile.  Again, we share a rum in a few seconds flat, part, and\
  \ I leave with the bus. Again, my spirit soars for Cuba, for its living for the\
  \ moment and rewarding you with richness, with your kin of the moment. That\u2013\
  plus the rum, not the arrest of before\u2013warms me. Perhaps I start to understand\
  \ Cuba.  \n \nA friend told me once to 'work in the gaps'\u2013live in the spaces\
  \ and around any blocks. Here, it seems, Cuban spirit has the constancy and strength\
  \ to fill, flex and enliven the gaps. It adopts the dance it requires, the grace,\
  \ the articulacy, and the poise to deliver\u2013a nation of dancers, performing\
  \ with skill. Because life is outwith control. Because they can\u2013and so, they\
  \ bloody well will. Because... Because."
