Text: "The drizzle had become a downpour in a matter of minutes. The rain was so heavy\
  \ my jacket was dripping with water and sticking to my skin. I was going to run\
  \ the rest of the way to my apartment as soon as the signal turned green. While\
  \ I stood waiting, ready to make a dash across the street, I felt the presence of\
  \ someone near me. A young woman was raising her umbrella over my head. \n     The\
  \ young woman walked with me, sharing her umbrella as we crossed the street. I lightly\
  \ bowed my head and thanked her. I explained to her that I was an exchange student\
  \ from America while we walked on, passing a brightly lit pachinko parlor, an obento\
  \ stand selling boxed meals, and Daikokuya, the local supermarket. When we reached\
  \ the next intersection, I thanked her again for sharing her umbrella with me and\
  \ turned to head in another direction. However, before I walked away, she pointed\
  \ to the building across the street. She told me her dance lessons were held there\
  \ and she had an extra umbrella inside. Then, she put her umbrella in my hand and\
  \ ran across the street in the rain. \n     The kindness shown was not an isolated\
  \ event, but a characteristic shared in many of the people I would meet. Japan is\
  \ renowned for its Shinto shrines, rock gardens, and more than eighteen hundred\
  \ temples, but perhaps less well-known is the hospitality of the culture. I had\
  \ entered a country where missing wallets were returned, confused travelers were\
  \ guided to their destination, and strangers were handed umbrellas in the rain with\
  \ no motive besides compassion. \n     My study abroad experience in Japan was the\
  \ first time I traveled to a foreign country alone. The program arranged for me\
  \ to live in a furnished, single apartment a few blocks from the university. In\
  \ the spring, I could observe sakura petals swirling in the wind at a park or in\
  \ the summer, stroll through a bamboo grove illuminated at night by wooden lanterns.\
  \ \n     My memories of Kyoto may fade or disappear with time, but my memories of\
  \ the culture will never leave me. The man who helped a girl pick up a row of bicycles\
  \ that she toppled over, or the businessman who stooped down and handed me my suitcase\
  \ when I dropped it, showed me how different a culture can be. Many visitors leave\
  \ Japan feeling pleased with the number of breathtaking sights they saw, but I felt\
  \ that I left with much more. I left remembering the people."
