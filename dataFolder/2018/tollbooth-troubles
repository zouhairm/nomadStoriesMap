Text: "Scott shifted to neutral. We coasted to a stop.\n\nDuring our race, we'd learned\
  \ Peru doesn\u2019t toll mototaxis. So this checkpoint, hidden in the jungle along\
  \ the Huallaga River, obviously wasn\u2019t typical\u2014or sanctioned.\n\nInstead\
  \ of government employees in a white booth, this checkpoint consisted of a band\
  \ of men leaning in the shade of a makeshift hut, rifles perched in the crooks of\
  \ their arms. And rather than gates or barricades, they had a rope stretched across\
  \ the road, sagging toward the potholed pavement. Dirty and frayed, it was clear\
  \ this rope couldn\u2019t stop much. Thus, the guns.\n\nA camo-clad man sauntered\
  \ over. His hand rested atop our mototaxi while his head ducked below the roof.\
  \ He slid his sunglasses down his nose and peered over the frames. If three gringos\
  \ wasn\u2019t surprising enough this far off the tourist-beaten track, our choice\
  \ of transportation was. A kind of motorized tricycle, the mototaxi is infamous\
  \ for its unreliability\u2014not ideal for an overland race, or running checkpoints.\
  \ The man smirked. Whether at the comical sight or his good fortune, we couldn\u2019\
  t be sure. \n\nHe spoke to Scott.\n\nWe had been advised to play dumb at these checkpoints,\
  \ so Scott\u2014near fluent\u2014shook his head and smiled, replying, \u201CNo fumar\
  \ espa\xF1ol.\u201D Rough translation: \u201CI don\u2019t smoke Spanish.\u201D This\
  \ garbled Spanish leant credibility to the implied claim.\n\nAs predicted, the man\u2019\
  s brow furrowed. He repeated himself, but slower, each syllable distinct. In the\
  \ backseat, Andrew and I tensed. Scott just shrugged though, still smiling. He echoed\
  \ himself, tone apologetic: \u201CNo fumar espa\xF1ol.\u201D\n\nA car stopped behind\
  \ us. The man stood to inspect the line. Further back was a truck, its engine winding\
  \ down. Urged by the growing number of tolls to collect, he ducked and made his\
  \ demand once more, this time accompanied by a gesture: an outstretched hand.\n\n\
  Andrew and I glanced at each other. That hand required no translation. Play dumb?\
  \ How?\n\nThe truck screeched to a stop, drawing the man\u2019s gaze. Scott capitalized.\
  \ He reached out and seized the empty hand, initiating a handshake.\n\nThe man\u2019\
  s eyes shot back to Scott. He stalled the shake but kept a firm grip while his gaze\
  \ wandered over each of us, face blank. Then he smirked, eyes rolling. He pushed\
  \ the sunglasses back up his nose and stood, calling to the hut. The rope dropped,\
  \ and he waved us on.\n\nScott shifted into gear and took us over the slack line.\
  \ We sped off as the man strolled to the next car.\n\nOne handshake? A fair price\
  \ for passage."
