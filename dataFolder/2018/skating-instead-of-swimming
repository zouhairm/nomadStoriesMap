Text: "\u201CGot any water?\u201D he yelled. Everything was parched, the grass, the\
  \ dirt. The landscape was so dry it was depleted of color, transformed into assorted\
  \ shades of sepia. The only moisture I could spot was on him, and he was drenched.\
  \ Standing in the center of a pool, his clothing dripped. But the pool, like everything\
  \ else, was waterless. His holey Vans completely dry on the dusty tile floor. With\
  \ the world so dehydrated, it felt blasphemous that my backpack contained a plastic\
  \ bottle full of water. \n\nWhile I rummaged through my bag, he skate boarded up\
  \ the curve of the pool and onto its edge. I tossed the bottle between the bars\
  \ of the wrought iron fence.  Catching it, he unscrewed the cap, sucked down the\
  \ water, and threw the empty container on the ground. At nearly fifteen, he was\
  \ clearly the oldest of the growing crowd of preteens that were now dismounting\
  \ their boards and meandering across pool in my direction. \n\nI must admit I was\
  \ surprised, these boys did not embody the current spirit of their city. Quickly\
  \ careening towards \u201CDay Zero\u201D, the name assigned to the date on which\
  \ Cape Town\u2019s worst drought would reach full effect, Capetonians would soon\
  \ turn the handles on their faucets to be met with a dry tap. Day zero was the reason\
  \ behind the signs taped in every public restroom pleading with patrons to opt for\
  \ waterless hand sanitizer instead of hand washing. Having only been in the city\
  \ for a couple days, I could already feel the stress everyone was exuding. Prospects\
  \ of queuing for water were enough to weigh on the entire population, not to mention\
  \ the impending fines that were incurred if individuals exceeded the meager fifty-liter\
  \ daily allowance.\n\nThe atmosphere was enhancing my depression. I had chosen to\
  \ take this trip to South Africa to distract myself from the fact that my future\
  \ also felt bleak. After trying and failing to move to a new city, I was back in\
  \ my hometown struggling to find work.\n\nWhile watching the boys doing tricks,\
  \ filming one another and laughing at their mistakes, a sensation of hope began\
  \ well up inside of me. These kids were making the most of a terrible situation,\
  \ choosing to adapt to their current state instead of being oppressed by it.  If\
  \ they could skate instead of swim, perhaps I too could get creative. So when my\
  \ new friend asked me if I wanted to join in, I hoped the fence, mounted the board\
  \ and squealed as the wheels of the tipped over the pool\u2019s ledge."
