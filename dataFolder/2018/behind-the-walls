Text: "We reached our destination and the first thing I noticed was a tall brick wall\
  \ surrounding the resort. Once we were inside I looked around and there were so\
  \ many things to do here. There were spas, 5 different pools, a beautiful private\
  \ beach area, restaurants and souvenir shops. There were so many activities as well.\
  \ But I was very curious to know why there was a tall brick wall surrounding the\
  \ resort. What is outside these walls?\n\nI wanted to explore and see more of Cebu.\
  \ So, I asked my guider if he could show me the city. So off we went but he only\
  \ showed me the nice places and I was not satisfied. I decided that I needed to\
  \ do it on my own, so I stopped the bus and I jumped out. As soon as I stepped out\
  \ of the bus, children ran to me asking for money and some were as young as three,\
  \ also begging. The police officer looking after me pushed them away as if he was\
  \ embarrassed of the sight. My heart felt heavy. Every step I took, my heart was\
  \ full of sorrow and hurt.\nOn my right, I see houses hand-made of cardboard boxes,\
  \ scrap metals and leaves. To my left I see rubbish in their sea waters, the water\
  \ was brown. Ahead of me was a very old man carrying a box full of newspapers he\
  \ was selling in the heat, I imagined my grandpa and it broke my heart. I walked\
  \ towards him and took the box from him and carried it. As I walked ahead the police\
  \ officer explained to him what I was doing, and he stood there and cried. I walked\
  \ back and thought maybe he was crying because he thought I stole the box, but he\
  \ told the officer he was very touched.\n\nWhat happened next was the action that\
  \ changed my life forever. \nAs we reached his house he ran in and grabbed a bag\
  \ with a loaf of bread inside.  All he had was a loaf of bread for his family that\
  \ night, he came out of his house with a smile and gave it to me, the officer explained\
  \ that I may throw the loaf out or look down on him for having nothing but that\
  \ is all he had to offer. I was lost for words. He gave me everything he had for\
  \ such a small gesture I had done for him. Such a small action meant a thousand\
  \ promising words to me, words that can never be taken away. So, in return I gave\
  \ him a box of loaves back to show him that I care for him and I am very thankful\
  \ for such a priceless gift.\n\nEven though i was surrounded by nice things, the\
  \ highlight was my experience outside of those walls and I can never forget the\
  \ love and kindness they share here in Cebu. It is the people who make the experience\
  \ more memorable."
