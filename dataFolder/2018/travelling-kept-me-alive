Text: "In my school days, i suffered from an auto immune disease 'lichen planus' as\
  \ a result of which chroinc skin infections were all over my body. Its so funny\
  \ that i used to think that i will die as there was no cure for it. One day i encountered\
  \ with a thought that crying over your fate is not going to help, if its really\
  \ end for me then why not end it beautifully, with tons of memories, seeing beauty\
  \ of the nature relaxing in its arms, printing beauty on my soul. That day, i told\
  \ my parents about my plan, it was difficult for a 15 yr old child to convince them\
  \ to come with me. But one day my dad came to me and said \"Listen son, i may not\
  \ be able to afford what you want but, i can still come with you\" tears were in\
  \ his eyes, i wanted to hug him but it would have been too emotional. We packed\
  \ our bags, took our savings but the dilemma was from where to start. People from\
  \ around the globe visit India for our culture, tradition, historical places. So\
  \ we also started our journey with the birth places of our gods as a tribute to\
  \ them with Ayodhaya (Ram's birth place), Mathura (Krishna's birth place), Varanasi\
  \ (Oldest living Lord Shiva's place), Haridwar followed by Agra(Taj mahal), Jaipur,\
  \ Delhi, Mumbai. In our bucket list there were also pondicherry i.e.,Paris of east,\
  \ Udaipur i.e.,Vience of east, Kashmir i.e.,Switzerland of India and more places\
  \ but till we reached mumbai our funds were exhausted. But, you can say it was a\
  \ boon that we stopped at Mumbai as we found a homeopathy doctor there who claimed\
  \ that he can cure me & his charges were also minimal, his treatment was a blessing\
  \ that God bestowed upon me. All my skin was free from fungal infections in 2 years,\
  \ but i still have those scars, spots, marks over my body. But as someone said \"\
  Remember the scars you have are proof you won a battle\" so i am not embarrassed\
  \ of them. But who gave me this life, who pushed me till here, who played a key\
  \ role in making me alive, my that one decision because of that i am living a healthy\
  \ new life and a self motivated person now. Whenever i don't know the answer of\
  \ something & needs someone to find it for me, I travel. I just pack my bags and\
  \ travel to places unexpectedly. I don't plan, neither stop somewhere, I roam &\
  \ roam till i find my solution. Nature is God guys, doesn't matter what religion\
  \ we follow at last we all kneel & pray to our God. Travel allows you to redfine\
  \ what failure is, As someone said \"Don\u2019t ask what the world needs. Ask what\
  \ makes you come alive\"."
