Text: "While people are dressing up to receive the New Year, I am here sitting in\
  \ the International Sao Paulo airport waiting for the call of my flight. \n\nI look\
  \ around and I open a very personal smile, I already crossed this airport some times\
  \ on my life, but I never saw it in that perspective, almost like a cemetery, so\
  \ quiet! Who are the crazy people that choose to flight exactly on New Year Eve?\
  \ Pleasure here I am! Next stop? Cordoba, Argentina. \n\nImportant tip dear travelers,\
  \ you can save a lot of money taking a flight on New Year Eve at night, it can be\
  \ much cheaper than the day before or in the day after. Despite the smiles, likely\
  \ someone in the crew would like to kill you to make them work when more than half\
  \ the world is celebrating! So, be polite and kind.\n\nThe plane took off few minutes\
  \ before midnight, it was a very interesting experience, we flew about fireworks,\
  \ the noise was very loud, but Sao Paulo looked a huge Christmas tree. It was a\
  \ very magical way of welcome the New Year.\n\nSummer vacations in Brazil it's the\
  \ perfect time to pack your luggage and go to the beach, especially for those like\
  \ me who were born in the heart of the country, far away from the coast. So why\
  \ spend the sunniest season of the year in Argentina?\n\nI decided improve my Spanish\
  \ doing a summer course in Cordoba.  Couldn\u2019t do it in another season? Yes,\
  \ but I am glad I chose it, because the last thing I expected was to live the best\
  \ summer of my life!\n\nCordoba is a vibrant city in the heart of Argentina, distant\
  \ 700 km from the capital Buenos Aires and also with an atmosphere totally different.\
  \ My only experience in Argentinean land had been in Buenos Aires, it was very nice,\
  \ but Cordoba showed me another side of Argentina that surprised me. \n\nThe summer\
  \ in Cordoba is very sunny, warm and humid. Perfect to have some drinks in one of\
  \ the incredible bars in Nueva Cordoba district. During the day you can have a walk\
  \ near the canal (La Ca\xF1ada), visit Sarmiento Park, and swim in one of the 8\
  \ public swimming pools or in the rivers and lakes surrounding the city.  I highly\
  \ recommend a visit to the river in Cuesta Blanca and San Roque Lake, in Carlos\
  \ Paz. Cordoba also has an intense night life that start always after 1 am. Go and\
  \ learn how to dance bachata, cumbia, salsa! \n\nCordoba gave me an unforgettable\
  \ summer, with new friends, new landscapes and many stories to tell. My heart it\u2019\
  s a half Argentinean after this amazing summer!"
