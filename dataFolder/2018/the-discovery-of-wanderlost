Text: "I would have never imagined that I would be the author of this story. The last\
  \ 4 years of my life turned out to be a unique, adventurous and eye-opening experience\
  \ that needs to be shared with the world.\n\nThis is the story of a young spirit,\
  \ motivated by her passion for languages and discovering the world. The story began\
  \ when she moved to Minneapolis to teach high school Spanish for a year, but it\
  \ ended up being so much more.  Just when she thought her adventures were over,\
  \ love knocked on her door, and she ended up to returning to Minnesota after visiting\
  \ her family back in her country.\n\nDriven by her heart, she went back with a Tourist-Visa\
  \ and spent 3 wonderfully challenging months in Minnesota. Taking advantage of the\
  \ fact that her love Peruvian, they decided to spend Christmas there, visiting family,\
  \ and doing together what they loved most, traveling. Peru was an unexpected trip\
  \ full of culture and gastronomy. However, nothing is last-longing, and that wondrous\
  \ holiday came to an end.\n\nIt was time to keep fighting for her dreams, so the\
  \ wind blew her to Buenos Aires, to keep evolving on her professional path. The\
  \ beginning was hard,  but in less time than she expected, she found a very interesting\
  \ teaching job in an English Academy where she was able to bring her creativity,\
  \ design, and personality to her courses.\n\nShe learned then that things always\
  \ happen for a reason. After that experience, she realized that there was still\
  \ more out there. Considering herself a permanent student of life, she decided to\
  \ pursue a dual International Masters Program, starting in Scotland, the land that\
  \ she always loved, and ending in the South of France, the perfect place to achieve\
  \ one of her goals of speaking French. It was such a scary, challenging and ambitious\
  \ decision, but before she could over-think it, she was accepted by the University,\
  \ had packed her bag and flew away. The more you dream, the more you achieve.\n\n\
  She promised herself a trip to Asia for her graduation, and she did so. The 3 months\
  \ in Asia were an unbelievable experience that marked a before and after in her\
  \ life. That is why I am writing this story now. The last thing I expected was to\
  \ be the creator and the protagonist of my own story. I have been always a travel\
  \ writer, but I didn\u2019t truly discover it until now, until the day I shared\
  \ all my stories with the world. People\u2019s interest in knowing more, motivates\
  \ me to write a blog or even a book. I believe in myself, do you?"
