Text: "I chose metro that runs over the city like veins and circulates the population\
  \ like blood, essential to animate the city to enter Old Delhi. After being tightly\
  \ stuffed in the rail, I stepped out onto Chawri Bazar station: expecting to inhale\
  \ the fresh scent of the place. On the first glance into the place; sight my eyes\
  \ captured was of an ocean of people, noise I heard was of a million things going\
  \ on, in an open yet a congested place; but the scent was of rich flavours of scrumptious\
  \ street food, piercing through my nostrils. Number of streets diverging from a\
  \ single rotary. Bundles of electric wires travelled from one rotten mansion to\
  \ another. As I walked further, I wasn\u2019t sure whom to approach on a busy street,\
  \ pacing seemingly faster than the second hand on my watch; even in the damping\
  \ humidity of a July afternoon. \u201CShould I approach the workers loading goods\
  \ on wooden carts, or the tuk-tuk drivers making way from thin passage leading to\
  \ Jama Masjid, India\u2019s biggest mosque\u201D, I thought to myself. Then I heeded\
  \ to bunch of school kids glaring at the ice cream stall. I stopped one of them\
  \ and invited to eat with me, offering to buy it for them and a 10 year old girl\
  \ ran on to my side. Salma, forced all her friends to join me. They all came in\
  \ and asked me take them to a distant kulfi shop. On our way Ahmed introduced me\
  \ to Shahjanabad, original name of the city built by the 5th ruler of the Mughal\
  \ Empire. Every other shop there run by the 5th-7th generation now, offered great\
  \ artistry, from paranthas in Paranthewali Gali to voluptuous silhouette in Meena\
  \ Bazaar. Advancing on to the hustling road, I witnessed scraggy lanes looking like\
  \ dead ends, extending to the residential spheres of the locals and Aalam\u2019\
  s as well, where he stopped to show me his haveli and introduced me to his Ammi.\
  \ She curiously questioned me about my background and showed me around their ancient\
  \ big mansion and took me to the terrace where I beheld a mystical sight of the\
  \ Red Fort on one side and Jama Masjid on other. \u201CMore than 25,000 men offer\
  \ prayers here everyday. Gurudwara Sisganj and Central Baptist Church on other corner,\
  \ symbolizes Unity in Diversity in Indian culture.\u201D she said and served me\
  \ homemade kheer. We all forgot about my treat. As I left, she guided me about famous\
  \ places around and some inside tips to negotiate in bazaar. The experience was\
  \ too colossal for words and a feeling too intimate to comprehend, as I kept coming\
  \ across distinguished people and places."
