Text: "After spending 6 weeks as a volunteer with the Mapuche people in the south\
  \ of Chile I decided it was time to check out the south of Argentina. Deciding to\
  \ hitchike, I packed my bags and quickly a car pulled over to bring me to san Mart\xED\
  n de los Andes. After a couple of days there I hitched a ride with a friendly elderly\
  \ couple moving down south from buenos aires and then to El Bolson which was to\
  \ be my destination, we spoke of all topics - football, politics, history and of\
  \ course barbecue - until they hugged me goodbye and wished me luck. El Bolson is\
  \ a vibrant and bohemian little town nestled in the most beautiful unspoiled Patagonian\
  \ scenery you can imagine, with rivers, lakes, mountain refuges and the opportunity\
  \ to spot the majestic condor. The town was established by people keen on living\
  \ an  alternative lifestyle during the military dictatorship. As part of a trip\
  \ to South America it is nothing like Machu Picchu, Christ the Redeemer or Uyuni\
  \ but it was here that I felt I learned the most about the Argentinian people and\
  \ never felt like a backpacker as I did at other times during my trip. I settled\
  \ into my hostel and after being offered a few mat\xE9s I thought I was learning\
  \ the etiquette, however it is a complicated ritual where many of the rules are\
  \ unspoken. I met Seba first, a travelling musician and street performer as well\
  \ as a magician, then Mart\xEDn, the Porte\xF1o who would die for River Plate, then\
  \ Gaby the 50-something who would smoke camels and offer his words of wisdom on\
  \ all topics. I intended to stay only 4 days and then move on but my plan kept changing\
  \ and soon it would be Christmas. After the Christmas asado and a lot of fernet\
  \ (the Jagermeister-like Italian liquor) I would leave for sure. But then it would\
  \ be new year...I decided to stay...on many of the days we just played football\
  \ or strummed the guitar but I felt very much at home. I was known as irland\xE9\
  s or Lego, on account of my hand always ready to accept a drink, but we bonded over\
  \ football, music and looking at a large map of Latin America on the wall, dreaming\
  \ of further travels. Being so far from home at a time such as Christmas and new\
  \ year can be difficult but it was such a simple time with barcbecues, mat\xE9,\
  \ fernet and endless cherries which are produced in the region. After the new year\
  \ celebrations and with a heavy heart I left the Rio Negro region and headed north\
  \ along Highway 40 to Mendoza, Salta, Jujuy and on to new adventures in Bolivia\
  \ and Peru."
