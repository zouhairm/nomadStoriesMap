Text: "My stomach fluttered uncomfortably as I approached the humble dwelling of my\
  \ husband\u2019s Filipino family. My trepidation was not due to meeting his tito,\
  \ tita and cousins for the first time. As sweat glistening on my forehead, I was\
  \ drawing closer to the moment I would be asked to sing for their eager ears. \n\
  \nAfter planning my first trip to the Philippines there were several things I knew\
  \ to expect; Asian comfort food at it\u2019s finest, hordes of friendly filipino\
  \ people, enough tropical beach beauty to give the Caribbean a run for its money\
  \ and the public humiliation of karaoke. \n\nIt was a typical, steamy evening in\
  \ Manila as I was welcomed into a small, two-story house full of warm, kind faces.\
  \ I enjoyed heaps of home-cooked chicken adobo with rice and a couple of luxuriously\
  \ cold San Miguel beers as I suspiciously eyed the bright blue television screen\
  \ where song lyrics passed by like rungs on a ladder. I was shown the Filipino practice\
  \ of Kamyan, or eating with your hands. I lacked grace and efficiency, but managed\
  \ to fill my stomach and had fun doing it. Mid-dinner, my hosts discovered that\
  \ I had not yet tried a famous filipino street food called balut, partially developed\
  \ duck eggs boiled in a salty soup. Jumping at the chance to meet my expectations,\
  \ my husband\u2019s uncle disappeared to the streets only to return with four large\
  \ balut. Balut, as it turns out, is quite savory and pleasant and should be appreciated\
  \ beyond its instagram-worthy shock value. \n\nA few of the adults anxiously got\
  \ the party started by belting out their favorite songs. I sipped and listened with\
  \ reverence, soon realizing that I was clapping and singing along. My husband\u2019\
  s aunts, uncles and cousins weren\u2019t singing into a machine in order to compete\
  \ with me or anyone else, they simply loved music and performing. My fear was (mostly)\
  \ melted away by the time the heavy microphone was in my hand. I squeaked out my\
  \ own version of \u201CI Saw Her Standing There\u201D by The Beatles, which is surprisingly\
  \ more difficult to sing than I had anticipated. Each person grinned and swayed\
  \ with the music, their faces absolutely glowing with pride from having introduced\
  \ me to so many traditions, karaoke clearly their favorite. We laughed for hours,\
  \ appreciating great lyrics and cheering each other on. Crowded shoulder to shoulder,\
  \ absorbing sheer joy, I learned that karaoke in Filipino homes is not a competition\
  \ but a celebration of unity and music. There is no quicker way to make strangers\
  \ into family."
