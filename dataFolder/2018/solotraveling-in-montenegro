Text: "Bus arrived to Budva. Small city next to see which went just for few hours\
  \ but it was worthy even for more. And here during night almost no-one just few\
  \ people and some souvenirs shops are working I guess life here in November is more\
  \ slow or more peaceful because of tourists are not here and that's good chance\
  \ for me to see this places from different angle. But what I saw during this trip\
  \ was that maybe there are less tourists  but cats are still visible. Almost at\
  \ the end of this place is small church and next to that is a cliff and you can\
  \ hear sounds of wave and just infinity darkness of the sea. So next stop again\
  \ by bus is city Kotor buses from place to place are quite cheap I guess because\
  \ it's small country. I came quite late but I charged just my phone and went out\
  \ during night because I wanted see this place from more sides not just day. Some\
  \ places are more beautiful during night some during day and some always. And what\
  \ is this One? Hard question because everyone see it different. This place has big\
  \ charisma because is like time traveling when we can be lost in small narrow streets.\
  \ I went at the city walls they are quite high and it's impressive that so many\
  \ years ago they build it on the mountain and it's still here. I made so many stops\
  \ on the way at the top because at every stop you can see different scenery and\
  \ combination of the Town mountains and bay. Unluckily it was cloudy but anyway\
  \ it was impressive. At lot of places is written that be careful of no entry but\
  \ anyway everyone is exploring this place as they want. And that view? Magnificent\
  \ it's so beautiful that I spent here more than our taking some pictures and just\
  \ looking because few years ago it was just idea to go and now I'm here standing\
  \ looking and feeling that image of what I see. On the way back I\u2019m going to\
  \ one place where is possible to go from one window at walls. And the way there\
  \ is small road next to mountain and I found abandoned small church and two horses\
  \ eating the grass there it was nice image like wild side of this place or like\
  \ more nature because are you can't hear sounds of cars and people it's just quite\
  \ there. And do you remember as I mentioned cats? Here they are more here they are\
  \ that more that they have here museum of cats but I didn't go there maybe next\
  \ time. And for sure I want come next time and maybe discovers more seaside of Montenegro\
  \ because this place is simply charming and surprising."
