Text: "I love the beach. The calm sound of the waves takes me to the sky, but I never\
  \ knew why. \n When I was a little kid and I did not know the beach, so I used to\
  \ love pools. Then, someday, I went to Bertioga, on the north coast of S\xE3o Paulo.\n\
  \ I remember I was impressed by the sea, and scared at the same time. That furious\
  \ - and in a certain way, quiet - sound of the water coming and going led me to\
  \ an understanding of the world and its greatness at the age of five. I loved the\
  \ sand. To put my hands and feet was an amazing thrill, and unique. However, I was\
  \ not prepared to deal with that sort of thing. I was so curious and in love at\
  \ the same time, that only the sand did not fill me. I had to go to the sea. My\
  \ brother held my hands and I felt the wet sensation on my feet. Suddenly, I was\
  \ being pulled by something unkown. It was only the Mother Nature doing her job,\
  \ driving the sea. I was terrified by that felling of being pulled, like I was going\
  \ to be carried away by the current, until the sensation was good. Good enough to\
  \ make me to fall in love with the ocean for all my life - until now. \n I was a\
  \ kid, but that memory of me into the waves is so vivid that everytime I close my\
  \ eyes and think about going to the beach, I feel again that mixture of love for\
  \ the unknown and the fear. I never thought that a first time could be so important\
  \ and so life-changing. From that day on, I started dreaming about living on the\
  \ coast, diving into the sea everyday after school, and appreciating the atmosphere.\
  \ \n I kept going to the beach, year after year, and refreshing my mind about how\
  \ incredible sand and water can be. Although, I still do not live on the coast.\
  \ But, that passion is intrinsic to me, so this is one of the dreams that I really\
  \ want to realize. To be able to breathe the sea breeze, to fill my blood with D\
  \ vitamin, to play with the dry and the wet sand, to jump waves, to dive and see\
  \ the fish, to calm down the heart and relax - and to speed up the circulation.\
  \ I know that someday I will, but for know, I do not mind remember my good moments\
  \ at my favorite place on Earth."
