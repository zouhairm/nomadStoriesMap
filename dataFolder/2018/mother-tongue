Text: "Tati and I were hopelessly lost at the outskirt of Paris. I stared at the map\
  \ for the Paris underground and sighed. I may speak the language but that does not\
  \ mean I know the city like the back of my hand. We seemed to have ended up in a\
  \ residential area, far away. I had a feeling Versailles was nowhere near here.\n\
  \n\u201CHey. Can I see the map?\u201D Tati asked. I handed it over to her and shoved\
  \ my hands in my pockets. If I couldn\u2019t figure out where we were, I don\u2019\
  t think she could either. The buildings were quaint in their rows. There were not\
  \ a lot of people out and about, but the few that were out looked at us only to\
  \ turn away. Our appearances screamed \u201CAmerican tourists\u201D especially because\
  \ of our gym shoes and backpacks.\n\nA young woman was passing by us.\n\n\u201C\
  Excusez-moi mademoiselle!\u201D I shouted. She jumped and looked at me oddly. I\
  \ walked over to her with Tati following.\n\n\u201CDo you know where Versailles\
  \ is?\u201D Tati asked. The woman understood the \u201Cwhere\u201D and \u201CVersailles\u201D\
  \ from her expression. She stuttered out that she only spoke a little English. I\
  \ tugged the map from Tati\u2019s hand. I began to talk to her in French and her\
  \ eyes lit up.\n\n\u201CJe parle un peu fran\xE7ais,\u201D I said. We exchanged\
  \ some pleasantries and began to discuss the situation. She spoke slow enough for\
  \ me to keep up. At one point, she learned a few English words from our pidgin language.\
  \ Tati was still in the back looking clueless.\n\nI knew my accent was heavy, and\
  \ I stumbled a bit with wording. She never laughed or sneered at me. People kept\
  \ telling me the French were rude. The statement was horribly incorrect. If anything,\
  \ she seemed so happy that I spoke French. I thanked her for the help. Tati and\
  \ I were not hopelessly lost. We wouldn\u2019t be able to make it to Versailles.\
  \ Back to the center of Paris it was.\n\nOn the train back, it got me thinking.\
  \ People in the United States always complain when people from Mexico speak Spanish\
  \ and not English. \u201CThey\u2019re in America so they should speak our language\u201D\
  \ is the constant argument. Americans are mean when people whose second language\
  \ is English stumble on pronunciation. Who\u2019s to say that people of other countries\
  \ can\u2019t feel the same? Maybe that\u2019s why French people are considered rude.\
  \ It\u2019s because of our double standard.\n\nHow ignorant others act when talking\
  \ to French people in English? We are in France and should speak French (or at least\
  \ attempt to), not English. It was an eye opener thought. I sighed as the train\
  \ stopped."
