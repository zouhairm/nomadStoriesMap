Text: "We had been walking over the past six hours and we were now right in the middle\
  \ of the Peruvian mountains. It was already late at night and my fellow traveler\
  \ Sabrina and I were quite exhausted. As young backpackers, we were told on the\
  \ way that the village we were heading to was nearby, maybe an hour away at the\
  \ most. It looked like the locals had a different perception of time.\n\nAll of\
  \ a sudden, as we were approaching the next village, a small middle-aged farmer\
  \ came out of the dark, a machete in his left hand. It was another opportunity for\
  \ us to ask for directions, in my broken Argentinian Spanish. Without a word being\
  \ uttered, Gonzalo ordered us to follow him so he could show us the way. We started\
  \ walking and quickly noticed the man was taking us deep inside the roadside forest\
  \ with no light. At this precise point of time, my friend and I started freaking\
  \ out and a lot of different questions popped out of our minds: where was this stranger\
  \ taking us to? Was it safe? Why was he holding such a large knife?\n\nI could now\
  \ remember my family and friends\u2019 comments about how dangerous South America\
  \ was and how I should stay alert at any time. After a while walking down the forest,\
  \ we were paralyzed with fear but somehow could not stop following Gonzalo. Should\
  \ we just retrace our steps and flee? How far would this man take us? Had he actually\
  \ understood the village name we wanted to reach and why would he come all the way\
  \ with us? Was his plan to eventually rob and kill both of us in the pitch-dark\
  \ woods? No possibility was ruled out.\n\nAfter a while, our guide finally stopped\
  \ and our anxiety peak was at its highest level. Gonzalo pointed out the illuminated\
  \ village in the distance, smiled at us and eventually left. Sabrina and I remained\
  \ speechless. Beyond relief, we felt guilt deep inside ourselves. How could we possibly\
  \ think this man would harm us while his mere goal was to kindly show us the way?\
  \ How could we end up so brainwashed so we felt hate and danger, instead of love\
  \ and safety?\n\nWhile exchanging a knowing look, my friend and I continued walking\
  \ through the thick vegetation and ultimately reached the coveted village. A local\
  \ inn was standing in front of us and a small monkey welcomed us warmly. We realized\
  \ we had made a \u2013missed- local connection and this meant a lot for us in terms\
  \ of culture, acceptance and reflection. We were forced to rethink our behaviors\
  \ and confront ourselves: after all, wasn\u2019t it all the meaning behind travels?"
