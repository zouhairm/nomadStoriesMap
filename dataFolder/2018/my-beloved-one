Text: "The first step on this other continent and I feel the hot air again. I stalk\
  \ my forehead, beads of water have formed. I gently wipe it off with the back of\
  \ my hand. I take a deep breath and I know everything will be fine, all that what\
  \ will be waiting for me the next time.\nSmiles are jumping from mouth to mouth.\
  \ I bend my upper body slightly forward and press my palms together. The person\
  \ standing in front of me acts like me. I am enchanted. Once again I take a deep\
  \ breath. Finally back to this wonderful place, somehow, in a completely absurd\
  \ way, despite all the differences to my own nationality, it feels like home to\
  \ me. That's a wonderful sign. I feel safe.\nOnce more overwhelmed by the magnificent,\
  \ historic and significant golden buildings. I am intoxicated by the confusion of\
  \ voices. I can only understand fragments, but hopefully that will change soon.\
  \ Because I'm ready to spend a part of my life here. I\u2019m ready to introduce\
  \ a deeper connection with this country and its inhabitants.\nHer gentle hand slides\
  \ down my back, determined by my shoulders. Her movements are skilful. I am relaxed\
  \ and so happy. As so often these days.\nI turn around, brush my hair back. In orange\
  \ robes, they brush past me. Full of energy, but also full of a magic calm. I think\
  \ the last months I never rest so much in myself. That\u2019s what I'm looking for.\n\
  Along the streets of the capital all seems chaotic, but these people are picked\
  \ with a inner peace that seems enviable. I feel the different tastes and they expand\
  \ my senses. I taste the sweet juice that runs down my throat. The culinary diversity\
  \ of this country is so wonderful and interesting to discover.\n\nYou are so diverse,\
  \ your inhabitants, the chaos of the big city, but also the wonderful peace on your\
  \ paradisiacal beaches. I feel like I want to stay longer.\nAm I in love? Oh yes,\
  \ I'm in love. You are so close to me with all your colors, your flora and fauna\
  \ and the inspiring scents. I take you with me, on the plane home and in my heart.\
  \ I carry you with me. Everywhere. See you soon, dear. I look forward to another\
  \ time with you full of interesting and unforgettable moments and memories. See\
  \ you soon my favorite Thailand. I love you."
