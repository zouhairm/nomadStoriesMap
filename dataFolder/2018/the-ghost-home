Text: "The house had been beautiful once. I could tell.\nCrumbling wooden frames and\
  \ cascading Japanese roof tiles aside, you could see the property had once been\
  \ proud. Now, the morning light did little to cast out the shadows that hung over\
  \ the dilapidated building, encouraging my imagination to run wild. It stood in\
  \ stark contrast to the humble beauty of Tadotsu\u2019s rural village surroundings,\
  \ drawing my eye away from the iconic buds of pale pink overhanging winding waterways,\
  \ away from the mossy stone walls and looming mountains. \nI turned to my companion,\
  \ Ando, and weighed my options. Japan was an exercise in self-restraint at times.\
  \ I\u2019d come with an open mind, but it wasn\u2019t always wise to open my mouth\
  \ without thinking. While often foreigners were, in my experience, granted some\
  \ leeway on broaching subjects that might be impolite to bring up, I preferred not\
  \ to push it. Curiosity killed the cat, after all\u2014\n\u2014But satisfaction\
  \ brought it back.\n\u201CSo, I noticed a few houses like this around, you know?\u201D\
  \nA hum of acknowledgment.\n\u201CReally stands out next to the surrounding houses.\
  \ Like a single rotten tooth between all the healthy teeth.\u201D\nAnother hum.\n\
  Sensing defeat, I deflated.\n\u201CI\u2019ve seen a few houses around like this.\
  \ Wondered what happened to them, I guess.\u201D\nBy this stage I figured I\u2019\
  d never get an answer. This wasn\u2019t the first time I\u2019d asked about the\
  \ mysterious properties that went unnoticed by everyone else.\nA pause, then\u2014\
  \n\u201CAkiya. Ghost homes,\u201D he said.\nIt was my turn to hum, daring to hope\
  \ that he\u2019d continue.\n\u201CFamilies live in the country. Children grow up,\
  \ they go to the city, they don\u2019t come back. Those left behind die. And then\
  \ the house dies.\u201D He shrugged. \u201CNo one wants it.\u201D\nI turned my stricken\
  \ gaze back on the house as Ando explained that the law made it difficult to resell\
  \ or tear down these houses. The real problem, however, went much deeper. He told\
  \ me that Japan wasn\u2019t suffering from an abundance of ghost homes. It was suffering\
  \ from a rapidly declining population. There was, quite literally, no one here to\
  \ buy this house. \n\u201CIt\u2019s \u2018mono no aware\u2019,\u201D he added as\
  \ an afterthought.\nOf course Japan would have a phrase to perfectly sum up the\
  \ evocative nature of this ghost home. The house truly inspired a sadness reflecting\
  \ the passage of time. The only ghosts here were the ghosts of the memories that\
  \ had been left behind, bound and invisible. They couldn\u2019t move on, and so\
  \ the property had sat and done the only thing it could do\u2014wait for someone\
  \ to return."
