Text: "We were waiting for the sun to set. I looked down from the mountain and saw\
  \ clouds floating like icebergs through smaller mountains. The ethereal haziness\
  \ of the clouds immobilized me and made me want to disappear in it all at once.\
  \ \nThe sun has almost disappeared below the horizon now. Never have I seen the\
  \ sky so fervent, painted with color and excitement as it bids farewell to the day,\
  \ welcoming dusk and the moon. Violet streaks dominated the canvas, accompanied\
  \ by one bold grey line and reddish yellow rays from behind the clouds. We lay down\
  \ on top of the mountain as the crimson-violet sky turned black. The infinite greenery\
  \ in the mountains mesmerized and stirred our souls. As the sun was replaced by\
  \ the moon, so the song on my iPod switched from \u201CWatching the Sunset over\
  \ the Castle on the Hill\u201D to \u201CAll of the Stars.\u201D The smoky clouds\
  \ passed through our bodies, and I thought we were going to be wet. But it was only\
  \ a cold feeling, like our frigid hands touching each other searching for warmth.\
  \ It covered us like a curtain every once in a while, coming and going. Above my\
  \ head, the bright light of the stars gave me hope for the future while the lost\
  \ light of the sun reminded me of the friends I would have to leave behind. At that\
  \ moment, the curtains moved away slowly to show the face of the radiant moon. It\
  \ illuminated the night that was now black as Snow White\u2019s hair. Suddenly,\
  \ I realized the beauty of having people who journey with you. Their presence can\
  \ warm you like the sun; new friendships forged through the mountainous ranges of\
  \ life. Experiences that give life fierce meaning. \nI slowly moved my hands away\
  \ from theirs and stood up to walk to the edge of the mountain. I feel the wetness\
  \ of the grass from the fog. The water drops sparkle in the moonlight, and stars\
  \ are glowing on the land. But these stars are different; they can fly. Their lights\
  \ flicker like embers in a campfire. They are the stars of this land. That\u2019\
  s when I feel two of my best friends drawing near to me, yet making no sound at\
  \ all. In the stillness of the night, the sounds of the cold, howling wind and the\
  \ singing crickets drown out the mushy footsteps of approaching company. \nI look\
  \ at her standing beside me. The gentle breeze blows through her hair, and her watery\
  \ eyes are glowing in the yellow light of the fireflies like the dew drops on the\
  \ grass. The last thing I expected was this teardrop when the wolf started howling,\
  \ and Chris Martin sang, \u201CTake me Back to the Start.\u201D"
