Text: "My twin cousins recently moved into a new flat, for which they threw a housewarming\
  \ party. But, the focus of my essay is the Griha Pravesh Puja(home christening)\
  \ that took place before the party began. The puja is a spiritual ceremony; the\
  \ Hindu counterpart of a mass. It is something so local to India, yet I came across\
  \ it for the first time and made a local connection not with any locals or region,\
  \ but an entire culture. \nMy Roman catholic maasi fell in love with a Hindu Brahmin,\
  \ owing to the need of a Puja at the new house. As I stepped out of the elevator,\
  \ a combined waft of Plaster Of Paris, heavily scented jasmines and incense sticks\
  \ led me to the \u2018Karkera\u2019s\u2019. The flat was in a state of complete\
  \ mess, yet due to the auspicious murat, the puja had to take place that day. The\
  \ electrical fittings were half done, still the two jhoomers(chandeliers), one above\
  \ the corner dining table & the other over my head, looked more than exquisite,\
  \ most definitely hand-picked by my tasteful sister. The pundit\u2019s chants broke\
  \ my reverie as I surveyed the living room. A huge Kaali Maata idol, adorned with\
  \ beautiful floral malas lay nestled amidst laddoos, blessed Prasad, diyas, oranges\
  \ & bananas. He recited his mantras & multi-tasked, making the couple- My maasi(aunt)\
  \ & mausa(uncle) add oil to the fire & filled Prasad into plastic packets. A little\
  \ boy dressed in a bare white dhoti & fiery red tikka caught my eye. Every time\
  \ the Pundit chanted \u201CSwaha\u201D, he dutifully went around the house, making\
  \ everyone take the blessings of the fire. Beautiful, intricate rangoli spread out\
  \ across two-thirds of the floor, stretching out till the balcony. After four rounds\
  \ of the little boy going around with the candle, the final leg of the Puja was\
  \ here. The gas had to be lit for the first time by heating the Prasad on it & then\
  \ the puja would be sampann (over)! Since the kitchen had only enough space for\
  \ the elders to fit, my cousins snuck us onto the adjoining terrace for a breather.\
  \ It was breath-taking as the windy breeze bellowed on our faces. On the seventeenth\
  \ floor, the terrace overlooked every building in sight, while on the road people\
  \ seemed like moving dolls & honking cars like toys. \nHunger presided over as the\
  \ caterers laid out the authentic vegetarian South-Indian buffet, having three types\
  \ of sambar, mango pickle, buttermilk, payasam for dessert among others. The day\
  \ finally came to an end as guests left & we arrived at the best part: unwrapping\
  \ all the presents together, most of it being clocks & house decor!"
