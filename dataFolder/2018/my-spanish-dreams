Text: "Spain is broadly divided into many geographic regions each with its own distinct\
  \ character, climate, terrain, food and even language. Therefore it becomes difficult\
  \ to point out any one particular region and attribute all things Spanish to it.\
  \ \nAnd yet, Andalucia, the southern part of the Spanish Iberian peninsula, can\
  \ be imagined as quintessentially 'old-world' Spain. In many ways it represents\
  \ the very soul of Spain. The overlapping set of visuals that start flooding my\
  \ memory effortlessly as I think of my last summer in Seville and Granada include\
  \ the lavish, elegant and vividly colourful polka-dotted flamenco dresses on beautiful\
  \ Spanish women, as they dance seductively, tapping their heels furiously on the\
  \ wooden 'tablao', matching their rhythm to the clapping and guitar, while their\
  \ expressions convey the deep pride and passion that flow through their gypsy songs\
  \ celebrating life and its struggles, riveting the audience. Immediately after,\
  \ I find myself drawn amidst the fanatic frenzy in a bull fighting stadium, with\
  \ the svelte matador dressed immaculately, standing right at the centre of the ring\
  \ with his death-defying gaze fixed at the sharp horns of the dark charging bull.\
  \ My mind implodes with the images of intricate and exquisite Moorish architecture\
  \ and elaborate gardens and orange orchards of the Alhambra Palace, long and romantic\
  \ horse carriage rides on quaint, meandering cobbled streets, lazy afternoon siestas,\
  \ boutique cafes, late night dinners sampling local tapas and almost life-changing\
  \ Spanish ham 'jamon iberico' with sherry wine, followed by the post dinner 'paseo'\
  \ or stroll, along with the locals in the main square of the city munching on the\
  \ heavenly 'chocolate con churros'! My Spanish dreams take me to the pristine white-sand\
  \ beaches and whitewashed villages along the southern coast, popularly known as\
  \ the trail of the 'pueblos blancos' and finally, it all ends with the Samana Santa\
  \ and Feria de Seville festivals during spring each year. These very snapshots of\
  \ Spain are the ones that make it so endearing to the discerning traveller willing\
  \ to immerse himself in the authentic Spanish experience and embrace a country so\
  \ beautiful and rich in history, art and culture and with people so generous and\
  \ warm. I went to Spain totally unprepared, like most tourists. But today, even\
  \ after almost a year, it feels so rich and visceral. It taught me a valuable lesson\
  \ on travel: to trust and surrender oneself to a place, and it always gives back."
