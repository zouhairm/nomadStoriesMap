Text: "\"There you are! Where have you been?\" My mother seemed stressed, and I had\
  \ no idea why.\n\"Looking around. Where have YOU been?\"\n\"Looking for you. You\
  \ were walking around in here the whole time?\"\n\"Of course,\" I said, a little\
  \ puzzled. \"There's a lot to see. Besides, where else would I be?\"\nAt the tavern\
  \ down the road, according to her. Lost in the cathedral, possibly passed out in\
  \ a dark corner where no one would find me, according to my father.\n\nWe were near\
  \ the entrance of the Ely cathedral, a spectacular structure whose scale and grandeur\
  \ I couldn't adequately capture in photos despite my best efforts. After stepping\
  \ through the front door, I had instinctively meandered into one of the two long\
  \ corridors on either side of the main hall. I'd seen my father positioning his\
  \ camera on the gate outside one of the corridors and wondered why he didn't just\
  \ come in to take pictures. Chalking it up to some sort of photography effect, I\
  \ continued to walk down the corridor, exploring the little halls that sprang off\
  \ it. After a while, my parents were nowhere to be seen, so I assumed they'd gone\
  \ on ahead and that I'd catch up at some point.\n\nI wandered around for about an\
  \ hour. We'd already been to a couple of other English cathedrals on that trip,\
  \ but this seemed by the far the prettiest, with domes so high you had to tilt your\
  \ head back to find the top, huge stained glass windows in every colour imaginable,\
  \ and sculptures so ancient I gave up trying to calculate how old they were. I was\
  \ also lucky enough to be part of a short, lovely prayer session.\n\nTurned out\
  \ that while I had been basking in the serenity and splendour of the space, my parents\
  \ had been worrying about where I'd disappeared to. My frantic father was on the\
  \ verge of calling for me on the cathedral's PA system. My mother was annoyed about\
  \ having to calm down a nervous husband while her daughter was, she was quite sure,\
  \ drinking beer with the little cash she had, completely oblivious to all the drama\
  \ she was causing.\n\n\"So you bought a ticket?\"\n\"No... you don't need one here,\"\
  \ I said.\n\"You do. That's why we didn't go in. Didn't want to pay to see yet another\
  \ cathedral.\" \n\"You don't! I walked in and no one asked to see a ticket.\"\n\"\
  Look.\" My mother pointed to a ticket counter that had previously been blocked from\
  \ my view by a group of tourists. \n\nUh oh, hope I don't get bad karma for this,\
  \ I thought, before explaining it away: \"Well, looks like I was invited in by a\
  \ higher power.\""
