Text: "Who knew that when you let fear co-exist with adventure, instead of ruling\
  \ it, the whole world would open up. \n\nAs I groggily woke up in the confines of\
  \ my tent, the four walls dripping with dew, it seemed like the whole world had\
  \ shifted slightly. As the light leaked in on the yellow walls, the air seemed still\
  \ and the hum of the trees softened. Only last night had this been the dark, dense\
  \ forest in which i pitched my tent in silence. Algonquin Provincial Park, Canada.\
  \ \n\nIt was yesterday, where my mind and body been tested in a way that I had never\
  \ felt before. I found myself in Toronto, Canada. Now it\u2019s not as if I was\
  \ deep in the amazon rainforest or high up in the Andes, but staring at the CN tower.\
  \ A building only standing around 550 m high.\n\nAs the sun sunk its rays into the\
  \ back of my neck, I tilted my head to look upwards towards the tower and as I did,\
  \ my heart doubled, my legs ached and my palms became warm.\n\nAs my friends rushed\
  \ ahead, my feet stepped backwards. My mind had many times before stopped me from\
  \ adventures, the excuses of danger or impossibility, and fear this day, was once\
  \ again the puppeteer and I was unable to fight it. \n\nAs I sat at the bottom of\
  \ the structure, watching the families take photos, the workers bustle around them\
  \ and the people on their return from the top, I couldn\u2019t help but feel discouraged.\
  \ That this fear had stopped me dead in my tracks. It had whispered in my ear to\
  \ not even attempt trying something new and filled me with such guilt that I knew\
  \ it could not continue. \n\nThat next morning, when I woke up what i least expected\
  \ to find was, as cliche as it sounds, was myself.  A part of myself that had been\
  \ hidden, shrouded by fear pulling it back with its grubby claws, owning it. I had\
  \ decided it was time. I was breaking up with fear for it had been toxic to me.\
  \ It had brought guilt to my mind and weakness to my body.\n\nBecause of this, what\
  \ you could call, an epiphany but I would call strength, I began to see mountains\
  \ as rocks to climb. Stars burned brighter as I slept underneath them, the taste\
  \ of foreign food electrified my taste buds. It was almost as if the missing piece\
  \ that I knew was hiding inside woke up and decided to finish the puzzle. Elizabeth\
  \ Gilbert once wrote that as long as fear takes a back seat on the road trip, and\
  \ doesn\u2019t touch the wheel, that creativity will drive on. I can safely say,\
  \ adventure is now right up front with creativity, tuning out fear with the promise\
  \ of the world to come."
