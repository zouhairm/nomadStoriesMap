Text: "Everything is planned so we know where all the free sites are and how to get\
  \ there. With $1000 and a credit card for emergencies, we are going to the Pacific\
  \ Ocean, up the coast and back, visiting as many places as we can. It is the adventure\
  \ of a lifetime. I have spent months saving and preparing. Everything was just beautiful.\
  \ There was much to see and I took thousands of pictures on this trip, I was trying\
  \ to capture every memory I possibly could. SD had badlands, bison, black hills,\
  \ Mt Rushmore, and Needles. Every morning we woke up to something amazing because\
  \ it was always dark by the time we got our tent set up. We found a way to make\
  \ everything an adventure on this trip. We happened into a city that looked like\
  \ we time travelled back to the old west, a historic mining city from the 1850\u2019\
  s gold rush and we spent hours with the town historian listening to stories and\
  \ looking at pictures. Saw beautiful architecture and so much history everywhere.\
  \ One of our campsites at the top of the mountain had miles of astonishing old cemeteries.\
  \  It was absolutely breathtaking wandering for hours through something over a hundred\
  \ years old and just taking everything in.  Driving down the mountain I saw road\
  \ signs and open rails and realized I had driven up through a rockslide the night\
  \ before. So scary! The next night a storm was coming and we has to tie our tent\
  \ to the jeep to not go over the edge it was so windy, we were above the thunder\
  \ and lightning and rain, and it was a phenomenal sight that I will never forget\
  \ as long as I live. Farther west, temps reached 100+; it had been 50 degrees that\
  \ morning when we woke up.  Fremont Street was culture shock.  We had become use\
  \ to no one, and now people were everywhere. 3 days in Cali: The Mojave desert,\
  \ then somewhere in the middle the most amazing site with hot springs and a cool\
  \ running stream, then the coast and the pacific highway. My first time in the Pacific\
  \ was at a campground with bluffs on the ocean. Then north from one beach to another,\
  \ watching whales and walking in the sand, and just loving life. Unfortunately,\
  \ more car trouble and depending on the gift of kindness and compassion from strangers\
  \ to get help. We left and drove through the redwoods and stopped at little towns\
  \ up the coast into OR. Yellowstone on the way home, a place I was not willing to\
  \ miss. Any planned itinerary went out the window the moment we left home and without\
  \ talking to locals; we never would have had the experience we did."
