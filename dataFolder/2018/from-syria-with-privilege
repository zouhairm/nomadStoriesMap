Text: "Cold wind ran against us as we climbed up Mount Bental. My nose became runny\
  \ and numb from the dry, sharp gusts. \n\nTo my dismay, we stopped in a shaded area\
  \ to hear about the history of the Golan Heights from our tour guide, making ourselves\
  \ statically vulnerable to the piercing wind. We were at a United Nations Peacekeeping\
  \ outpost along the Syrian border, just a five minute drive from where 40 peacekeepers\
  \ were kidnapped by Al-Nusrah in 2014, but here we were \"safe.\"\n\nI hadn\u2019\
  t expected it to be so cold, this was Israel after all, and the way I shook to keep\
  \ myself warm gave me the appearance of an Orthodox Jew zealously davening. I stepped\
  \ away from the group for a moment to soak in every ray of warm sunlight I could\
  \ find, and that was when I heard what we\u2019d been warned about but never expected.\n\
  \nIt was as if we heard the echo of a balloon that was popped deep below us, in\
  \ Hell. The sight was underwhelming by Hollywood standards: no mushroom cloud or\
  \ Death Star blast. Rather, light wisps of white leaked out of the building that\
  \ had just been bombed, and softly painted the skyline of the city Quneitra below.\
  \ Perhaps the sound was only to announce the opening of a new cloud factory in Quneitra.\n\
  \nQuneitra, a city bombed to the ground and then some is home to less than 150,\
  \ who have been subject to a decades-long game of tug of war between Israel and\
  \ Syria. Captured during the Six-Day War, reclaimed and then recaptured during the\
  \ Yom Kippur War, and now a battlefield between rebel forces and the Syrian Army.\n\
  \nA few skeletal, shelled buildings still stand. A Greek Orthodox church, a mosque,\
  \ and a disfigured hospital with a sign reading, \"Golan Hospital. Destructed by\
  \ Zionists and changed it to firing target!\"\n\nThe bombing continues as we hear\
  \ a second explosion. Though unlike the farmers who exit the city each day to plow\
  \ the fields which rest at the foot of the mountain, we are safe.\n\nWe have a few\
  \ minutes to explore the outpost, and we wait our turn to make smalltalk with two\
  \ UN Peacekeepers from Canada stationed at the mountain\u2019s peak who allow us\
  \ a photo. They snacked on a chocolate bar and next to them a levitated a hawk,\
  \ frozen in place; its flight sustained perfectly by the constant wind.\nWitnessing\
  \ carnage from safety is an odd and guilty sensation.\n\nEventually, we have to\
  \ go. I say a prayer for Syria and begin my descent as it\u2019s time for us to\
  \ get back on the bus.  Next, we\u2019re off to a wine tasting at a nearby vineyard,\
  \ and then a hot spring day spa."
