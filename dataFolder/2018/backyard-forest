Text: "A few months ago, I was on my computer looking at maps to create a bike route;\
  \ I usually just grab the bike and start pedaling until I get tired but this time\
  \ I wanted to be away from the asphalt as soon as possible. Being born and raised\
  \ in the Dominican Republic and a mountain bike enthusiast, I grew fond of wandering\
  \ in the woods and exploring new places but, currently living in The Bronx my and\
  \ my mountain bike can only dream about its first name; If I wanted to see some\
  \ foliage, I'd would have to pedal for about an hour and/or bow to the inevitable\
  \ trail at the nearest park. As I traced my way out of town, I noticed a mile and\
  \ a half strip that was greener than the others and I couldn't recall being on that\
  \ road ever before. \n\nAfter some online research, I found out it was an abandoned\
  \ railroad and me being me [always up for an adventure, a challenge and some fun],\
  \ decided to leave the bike for another day and headed to this new place with my\
  \ second-best friend, my X-T2. \n\nI read about the junk, the swamp-like water levels,\
  \ the dangers, the stench; but all I could think of was... THE ADVENTURE!!!\n\n\
  Such an abandoned place, so close to me, unnoticed and unclaimed (the ownership\
  \ of the lot is debatable, nor the city or prior owners take responsibility for\
  \ it). I took pictures as I went in, venturing into this \u201Cconcrete jungle\u201D\
  , looking at how nature repossessed its terrain with every inch of flora spreading\
  \ freely without limits. Garbage, shopping carts, house keys, abandoned cars and\
  \ graffiti art showed me that even when I was not the first one there, the area\
  \ gave me a scenery most people don't even know exists. About halfway through I\
  \ realized I couldn\u2019t go any deeper due to high mud levels, but promised to\
  \ go back in winter when the water freezes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I walked back\
  \ with my ripped jeans and unique memories that realized how not a single guard\
  \ or sign warned me that the deeper I got into this adventure, the more unique this\
  \ experience would be.\n\nhttps://spark.adobe.com/page/N3NIXjsBG0WY7/"
