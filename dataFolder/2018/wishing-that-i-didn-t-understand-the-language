Text: "Cat Ba Island was one of the most beautiful places that I had ever visited.\
  \ The surrounding green waters\nstudded with towering limestone karsts were the\
  \ subjects of my dreams long before and after my cousin\nand I had kayaked there.\
  \ Despite that, I more often recall the first night that we had spent on Cat Ba.\n\
  \nWith some spare hours before bedtime we explored the nearest bay. My cousin parted\
  \ with me to sit on\nthe dock. It didn\u2019t interest me because I didn\u2019t\
  \ think it was beautiful at night. The fluorescent streetlights\ncheapened the last\
  \ traces of sunlight. I watched the silhouette of a man approach my cousin and she\n\
  soon walked back to me with a grimace on her face.\n\nI already knew what had happened.\
  \ We had received a few inappropriate comments from men during\nour trip but it\
  \ was in Cat Ba, which seemed to be primarily inhabited by males who worked and\
  \ sent\nmoney to their families back home, where the slew of lewd remarks was incessant.\
  \ I had come to\nVietnam hoping to improve my Vietnamese but now I never had so\
  \ badly wished that I could not\nunderstand their words.\n\nAfter getting ripped\
  \ off on some coconuts we decided to return to our hotel room. On our way back I\n\
  heard the rumbling buzz of a scooter. I had hoped that they\u2019d ignore us but\
  \ the young male rider and his\nfriend veered in front of us and obstructed our\
  \ path. What they said was innocuous in isolation, but it\nwas the way they looked\
  \ at us that I cannot forget. They looked at us with a tone of amused smugness,\n\
  lust and disdain. It hurt me to know that there were people like them who took joy\
  \ in seeing me afraid\nand upset. I lazily flung coconut juice in their direction,\
  \ letting my initial feeling of annoyance override\nmy fear and anger. This only\
  \ amused them even further. They laughed at us and drove off.\n\nBack in our hotel\
  \ room I attempted to assuage my cousin\u2019s anger but I also struggled to resolve\
  \ my own\nfeelings. Against the wishes of my mother, who had mostly known Vietnam\
  \ as the war-torn country of\nher youth, we had refused to allow our uncle to accompany\
  \ us in our travels. This trip was for us, I had\nargued; it was to allow us to\
  \ deepen our understanding of our identity. And besides, females traveled\nalone\
  \ to this country all the time. I questioned my decision to travel without male\
  \ companions. I\nquestioned my feelings towards Vietnam and dreaded the world outside\
  \ of our room. Fighting back\ntears, I vowed that I wouldn\u2019t let these experiences\
  \ bother me, at least until this trip was over."
