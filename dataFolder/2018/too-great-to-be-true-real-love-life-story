Text: Hope, love. & prevailing. The main reason why I want to lead individuals to
  make each of our lives better with simple information that nurtures, manifest, &
  discover who we each are/ inner self. Love thy self we all will have abundance,
  glorious lives with a twist. We can have it now, why not right? I care for others
  that's just who I am. Of course I have flaws I appreciate bad because it made me
  want to pursue these life long plans show a world we can have lives full of love
  networking became my main concept. Hopefully my other ideas, goals, & plans collide
  together in the end results. Going on a plane which I've never done, another country,
  meeting people, the culture/the food, the smells & sounds, Ooooh its all magical.
  All of it inspires me to strive for the best in all my plans & goals etc & choosing
  positivity for better results in every setting/ scenario. We are all born winners.
  Life could be tough but we learn & process differently, & some people have a confusion
  of happiness, or love and I'd like to help, guide, mentor and etc at least have
  open mind or heart. Possibly both. It's truly never is too late to create our own
  reality, & I just want everyone to know its like I want to get a ice cream truck
  & let everyone know on the speaker that our growth for a better life starts with
  each of us. I'm sure you know that no one can change someone, we can only hope that
  they change but if they undeniably want to change then nothing can stop that force.
  I can show & tell I have proof once I have delivered the information  everyone is
  able to look into it further & I'll answer any questions. I'm very social I can
  start up a conversation with anyone, any language I just use google translate and
  its amazing to be able to even have that/ this opportunity. No matter what happens
  in my future I will continue to learn, grow, & accomplish any of my plans, goals,
  & dreams. I'm a dreamist first, an idealist second, and a realist last because miracle's
  happen everyday &  just me being able to see, read, & write I have all these blessings
  I try & not take it for granted, life is short but I'd like everyone to know we're
  eternal loving beings. No one is perfect & to me that's the greatest part we all
  love different, I've had to put up with some negative people in my life, we all
  do but I never let that get me I love them still for showing me these little life
  lessons. Ill take good with the bad & bad with the good that's just part of the
  game of life. Take a chance
