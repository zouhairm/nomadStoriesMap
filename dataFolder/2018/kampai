Text: "It\u2019s a small first floor in Magome, a local Izakaya in the Umeda neighborhood\
  \ of Osaka. Although there\u2019s an upstairs, no one wants to sit so far away from\
  \ the appeal.\n\n\u201CKampai!\u201D Everyone\u2019s yelling every so often after\
  \ taking a shot of Asahi or hot sake, and in between bites of meatballs, karaage\
  \ fried chicken, flame grilled fish or even a few vegetables. Appetizingly, an abundance\
  \ of food is sitting in the middle of what can only be described as a massive table.\
  \ Positioned around the enormous table are 12 seats filled with hungry patrons hastily\
  \ yelling out their orders to the cook, to whom I\u2019ll refer to as \u201CThe\
  \ Grill Master\u201D, as he acknowledges the requests for food and delivers it simultaneously.\n\
  \nEveryone here is either a Japanese businessman or the wife of a Japanese businessman.\
  \  If someone were attempting to achieve a panoramic view of this beautiful setting,\
  \ they would follow the imaginary camera from left to right, but there would be\
  \ an abrupt pause, because there\u2019s an African American woman with dreadlocks\
  \ sitting alone.  Or is she? Is the Japanese man sitting right beside her, pouring\
  \ copious amounts of Sake, her date? How in the world did she get here and does\
  \ she speak Japanese, because that\u2019s the only way to get any food around here?\
  \ He is both her friend and dinner date. She met Nobu Yoshioka on a travel website\
  \ and has him to thank for introducing this foreigner to the local, after-hours\
  \ side of Osaka. Nobu is an extremely debonair businessman. Her? Oh, she simply\
  \ loves to travel and explore culture through food. He was eager to show her Tokyo\
  \ during her first visit to Japan, and she happily obliged. Waiting outside Tokyo\u2019\
  s Nishi-Shinjuku station, Nobu noticed her immediately; guess she didn\u2019t blend\
  \ too well amongst the Japanese after work crowd. Sushi, karaoke and a friendship\
  \ wrapped up their first meeting. One year later and 500 km away, in another beautiful\
  \ Japanese city, Osaka, she is an honorary Japanese woman. And for a split second,\
  \ she is reminded how open hearts and new friendships have sustained themselves\
  \ over 7000 miles. She can thank God, chance, or even luck, but whatever it is,\
  \ she\u2019s happy to be sitting in this coveted seat, in the midst of Osaka yelling\
  \ \u201CKampai\u201D, embodying the Japanese Spirit all because she embodies the\
  \ concept of exploring food and culture by way of the friendships made through local\
  \ connections.\n\n\u2026and that she is me!"
