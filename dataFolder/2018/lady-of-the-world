Text: "I Participated in Sochi Festival for Student more than 30000 Participant from\
  \ 12-24 October 2017 in Russia. World Festival of Youth and Students will be the\
  \ largest event in the field of international youth cooperation and will bring together\
  \ more than 20,000 of young people from 150 countries around the world.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve marked my presence in this Festival together more than 100 Pakistani delegates\
  \ representing Pakistan in 19th WYFS in their own fields, from engineering, medicine,\
  \ journalism, art, etc. I took part into various art and cultural activities: painting,\
  \ flower making workshop, dance, cultural day (I wore a traditional Harare paired\
  \ with handcrafted embroidery shawl), robot walk, industry of future, library of\
  \ the future, master art class of watercolor, classic music performance, etc\u2026\
  \ We also experienced a little of different cultures and traditions through special\
  \ events; for example, we celebrated Diwali festival over there with some Indian\
  \ delegates. I continued that enjoyment and excitement of seeing things that were\
  \ totally new or different for me; especially computer modeling, four-dimension\
  \ video and two-digital image manipulation have fuelled my current art exploration.\
  \ I\u2019m keen to taste exotic art through journey of discovery and expression.\
  \ It is the process by which I choose to explore the possibilities of crossing over\
  \ disciplines and redefine my relationship with art and its incorporation in everyday\
  \ life. \nI took advantage of being in Sochi for travelling around Russia and visiting\
  \ also Moscow and Saint Petersburg. For me, there were a few \u201CI can\u2019t\
  \ believe I\u2019m here!\u201D moments during my travels\u2026\n\nIn Sochi: Black\
  \ Sea, Sochi Olympic park & Sochi Park.\nIn Moscow: The Kremlin, Central House of\
  \ Artist, Red Square, Saint Basil\u2019s Cathedral, Gorky Park, Ivan the Great Bell\
  \ Tower, Tomb of the Unknown Soldier & State Historical Museum.\nIn Saint Peters-burg:\
  \ Hermitage Museum, Winter Palace, Church of the Savior on Blood, Peter and Paul\
  \ Fortress, Saint Isaac\u2019s Cathedral, Kazan.\n\nEach day of the Festival program\
  \ was dedicated to a particular region of the world, the last one to the welcoming\
  \ country (so, this time, Russia). There were a lot of very different and very interesting\
  \ events: after the opening ceremony, several exhibitions, concerts, cultural activities,\
  \ sporting activities, scientific and educational areas, traditional celebrations,\
  \ and at the end the closing party."
