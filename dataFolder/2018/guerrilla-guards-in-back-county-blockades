Text: "The svelte well-worn nine-seater smelled of blasting berry lemon air. Outside,\
  \ the smoke of burning fields, rubbish and kitchens idled past in a fog. I watched\
  \ the rural life of Luzon, The Philippines main island, pass secretly through the\
  \ night as we were bounced from one car-sized pothole to another. \n\nThirteen hours\
  \ from Manila to our destination. The coastal town of Bulan. The south-east end\
  \ of Luzon island. We were at hour eight. Deep country. The banana trees and emerald\
  \ fields had been replaced by mostly occupied house shells pocketed in the jungle.\n\
  \nThe countryside romance had gone, replaced with the question of why we were travelling\
  \ so slowly (fractured roads) and how we hadn\u2019t taken a plane (economy of cash,\
  \ not time). \n\nDeep in the night, we slowed to a stop. I thought it must have\
  \ been the mother hole. Unbeknownst, up ahead, burning barrels and a spindly rope\
  \ signalled a rudimentary checkpoint manned by bandana-faced NPA (New People's Army),\
  \ locally known as Nice People Around.\n\nA call was sent through the half sleeping\
  \ van that the white guy (me) should catch a few z's on the floor, lest the NPA\
  \ patrolmen see me and raise the border fee. Or worse. The smoke was thicker here\
  \ from the blazing bins, making a screen to dissuade travellers from careering through.\
  \ It worked together with the wiry rope that was taut across the road, manned by\
  \ a couple of teen soldiers. Oh, also the barely visible show of arms may have acted\
  \ as a deterrent. \n\nThere was a discussion in Tagalog as to our intended destination\
  \ and cargo. I don't think I factored in the manifest. Some lookyloos marched past,\
  \ inspecting through almost impenetrably darkened windows. Money coughed, nod given,\
  \ rope dropped and on we bounced to Bulan. \n\nWe discovered on subsequent trips\
  \ that on a one-hour flight to Legaspi airport, you get an exciting descent passing\
  \ the Mayan volcano with its perfect cone shape. Not today. \n\nBulan itself is\
  \ a pretty seaside town filled with local seafood, pan de sal kiosks and isolated\
  \ rural videoke (Filipino video karaoke) dens.  The Merriment Of Senior Citizens\
  \ Concert in an open beachside pavilion was a rewarding highlight. Just seeing those\
  \ lithe octogenarians do the ocho ocho (slightly bent over twerk with chest thrust)\
  \ made Bulan worth every hole there and back."
