Text: "I met the young Vanja on a strange night in Ukraine, when I opened my eyes\
  \ in a house that I didn't know. I turned around my sore head in that spooned restroom.\
  \ There were an old tv and a wooden hanger only.\nThe voice behind me spoke in Italian:\
  \ \"Are you alive?\"\nI turned and I saw a smiling teen boy sitting on a chair.\n\
  \"I thought yes\", I answered in Italian. \"But who are you?\"\n\"A boy that saved\
  \ you. I saw you are Italian and I'm studying it.\"\n\"Ok, but...\"\n\"You were\
  \ drunk on a bench, but you didn't look like a bad boy.\"\n\"How did you know that\
  \  I'm Italian?\"\n\"Ehm... I tried to steal you some money, but you had nothing...\"\
  \n\"Serious? They stole all my money! Fuck!\"\n\"I can help you to turn back your\
  \ home, but you have to cook some pasta in the Italian style for me, first.\"\n\
  I whatched at his blue eyes and said: \"Oh, ok. I'm Italian. Show me what you have\
  \ in your fridge.\"\nWe ate pasta with tomatoes and cheddar (it was all he had,\
  \ sorry Italians) and I teached him how to cook it. \n\"And you?\", I asked while\
  \ eating.\n\"What?\"\n\"You are too young to live alone.\"\n\"No, I live with my\
  \ mom, but she's working now.\"\n\"Ok. Do you study or work?\"\n\"Both\", he answered.\
  \ \"But my dream is living and studying in Italy.\"\n\"Oh... why?\"\n\"I love that\
  \ language... and girls too!\"\nWe laughed and then he helped me to turn back home.\n\
  I will thank Vanja forever. I don't know where I\u2019d be without him, now. Next\
  \ week he is going to come and stay with me in Italy, in my house. He wants to graduate\
  \ in literature. He loves Italy, he says. And I love Ukraine, I say."
