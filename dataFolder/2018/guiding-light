Text: "I close my eyes and feel myself there again, under the gloom in that old neighbourhood\
  \ of deep silence. I stop and let a few minutes pass, trying to get my retina to\
  \ get used to the absence of light. I still feel my tongue irritated, because yet\
  \ again they added too much spice to my chicken tikka masala. Luckily, I feel the\
  \ aftertaste of the delicious lassi and it\u2019s touch of pepper.\n\nI walk a few\
  \ meters and try to force my eyes, knowing that my eyes have become accustomed to\
  \ the low light, I look at the facades of the houses, but I still do not find any\
  \ reference points that tell me how to get to the hostel. I begin to think that\
  \ this place has nothing to do with that of just a few hours ago. Varanasi, what\
  \ has become of your lively and colourful streets? I cannot see the shops with the\
  \ brightest saris. I do not hear vendors screaming, I cannot smell masala curry,\
  \ spices, vegetables, fruit, marigold flowers. Now your very narrow alleys are mysterious\
  \ and somewhat gloomy. The flashlight on my phone lets me glimpse what's in front\
  \ of me, the dogs howl in my step, the rats run when they hear me, and the sacred\
  \ cows continue to block streets. I feel that I walk in circles, my path has become\
  \ a labyrinth that I cannot get out of. My heart beats very fast and every emotion\
  \ and stimulus is multiplied by ten. My stomach begins to purr because of nerves.\
  \ Fear? I guess uncertainty. My head reminds me and repeat that was not always easy\
  \ for me in other countries.\n\n-Namaste! \n\nI hear a deep voice in the distance,\
  \ for the first time since I left the restaurant, it is not the sound of an animal.\
  \ Part of me is comforted, but part of me is forced to raise my guard. He does not\
  \ speak much English, but I understand just enough that he is offering help if I\
  \ need it. He has brown eyes, black hair and a very particular head movement when\
  \ he tries to understand what I am saying. Nodding, start walking, where to? I do\
  \ not know. I follow him? What else can I do? So again my legs begin to walk. After\
  \ a few minutes he suddenly stops and points out a place for me. My eyes cannot\
  \ believe it, in front of me I have the humble hostel that I really wanted to see.\
  \ I get one of the most sincere smiles of my life, I take out a few rupees from\
  \ my purse while I thank him again and again for his help and I wish him good Karma.\
  \ \n\nThis time I close my eyes to go to sleep, the Ganges will rise in a few hours\
  \ and another unexpected day awaits me in this wonderful, moving and mystical city."
