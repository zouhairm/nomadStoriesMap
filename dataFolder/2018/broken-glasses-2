Text: "The last few hours were exhausting. We woke up around midnight, climbed the\
  \ second volcano in three days, inhaled sulfur gas which made us cough and cry and,\
  \ ultimately, I broke my glasses. The whole scene must have been rather amusing,\
  \ if you could've seen it, but luckily enough inside the caldera it was pitch-black.\
  \ I was climbing down to reach the famous blue fire crater when I lost my footing\
  \ and slipped. My glasses fell from my face, luckily I caught them with both of\
  \ my hands seconds before they hit the rocks below. But, from the sound they made,\
  \ I knew something was wrong; when I opened my hands I noticed they were in two\
  \ pieces. \u201CGreat\u201D I thought. \u201CI\u2019m inside an Indonesian volcano,\
  \ it\u2019s night, I can barely breathe and I just broke my glasses\u201D. I survived\
  \ the descent, but the blue fire wasn\u2019t as cool as we expected. The next morning\
  \ we departed Java for Bali. During the boat trip, watching the waves lapping against\
  \ the bow, I wasn't in the best of moods. \u201CThings will be better\u201D Vale\
  \ said. I nodded my head, grasping the patch that barely held my glasses together.\
  \ \u201CHopefully\u201D I replied. The sight of Bali coast cheered me up a little.\
  \ From that moment on, we were to have two weeks lounging on the beach, swimming\
  \ and diving in the crystal-clear waters of the Island of the Gods. At the pier\
  \ we jumped in a taxi and headed for Pemuteran, the first leg of our journey. The\
  \ driver dropped us off in front of a sewing shop. There were three women sitting\
  \ outside, a mother and her two daughters, I figured. We introduced ourselves. \u201C\
  Guests!\u201D, she said, with a contagious smile. Our room was situated right behind\
  \ the shop: on the bed there was a beautiful, extremely fragrant, bouquet of red\
  \ flowers. We left our bags and went out to meet the rest of the family. The father\
  \ was there too, an old toothless man with a kind face. I showed him my glasses.\
  \ \u201CDo you have glue?\u201D I asked. \u201CGlue? Oh, glue!\u201D. He said something\
  \ to his younger daughter who rushed out of the shop. \u201CWe fix\u201D he said.\
  \ After a while the girl came back with a small bottle of transparent liquid. The\
  \ father took my glasses and between us we tried to fix the damage. It was a messy\
  \ situation: we had sticky fingers, some of the glue fell onto the lenses and eventually\
  \ we couldn\u2019t manage to fix them. We looked into each other\u2019s eyes and\
  \ we burst out laughing, along with Vale, the wife and the daughters. \u201CMaybe\
  \ you don\u2019t need them!\u201D he exclaimed. I looked outside, at the sunny beach,\
  \ and realized he was right."
