Text: "Every individual has a journey of its own, in my case the journey of two of\
  \ my younger brothers took me home to my roots and certainly to my core self .\n\
  Every December holiday\u2019s black South African families residing in beautiful\
  \ urban cities pack their bags and head \u2018home\u2019. In the case of my family\
  \ home was a vibrant rural area in the heart of East London in the Eastern Cape.\
  \ However this trip was different from all other trips in the past of going home.\
  \ This time when we came back to the city my brother\u2019s would be men.\nI have\
  \ always been conservative when it comes to cultural and traditional ceremonies\
  \ especially being a girl who grew up in the city. This time home was filled with\
  \ joyful singing of traditional songs praising the young boys for their bravery\
  \ of starting their journey of manhood, the days and nights were filled with rural\
  \ residents gathering at my grandmother\u2019s house praising and dancing, the wildfire\
  \ that was created by all those souls rekindled the love of music and art in me\
  \ .\n I learnt a lot about my culture majority of the things were unknown to me\
  \ for the 20 years of my being on this earth. I learnt how to brew traditional beer\
  \ which takes a lot of effort and discipline and rules that need to be respected\
  \ and followed otherwise the beer will not be satisfying which at first I thought\
  \ it was just a superstition until my uncles were not happy with my \u2018version\u2019\
  \ of traditional beer .I was then removed from my duties of brewing the beer turns\
  \ out I\u2019m too city for the area ,to my surprise I wasn't offended at all instead\
  \ I was glad to find out that t I spent too many years  of my life hiding and avoiding\
  \ culture which would  later inspire my art.\nI spent the rest of my holiday travelling\
  \ the woods of the rural area I was intrigued by the great stories that were told\
  \ by the elderly about the bushes and the dams of the area. Being home started to\
  \ feel like a spiritual journey for me.Umeluko meaning the road to manhood which\
  \ was the journey of my brothers had brought my relatives together in conflict and\
  \ in celebration they were not the  only one\u2019s about to enter a new era in\
  \ their lives it was all of us in the family . Family feuds were laid to rest well\
  \ at least for some members while for others they had just begun. This was the beauty\
  \ of being home within myself I had laid to rest my identity crisis that has led\
  \ me to the beginning of an internal adventure that demands me to connect with my\
  \ ancestors and finally with myself ."
