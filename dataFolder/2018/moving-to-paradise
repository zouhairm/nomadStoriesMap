Text: "It's been six months since my boyfriend decided to go away from our home and\
  \ there I was trying to do something cathartic! I turned on a movie that put me\
  \ on a better mood, I picked and never will forget this, I picked Fool's Gold. So\
  \ there I was in my room, cleaning and watching the ocean in a movie while I cried\
  \ for this guy. Who hasn't had a bad breakup right?\nI was depressed, no sleeping,\
  \ no eating, skinny as broomstick. He was the first guy in many years that I brought\
  \ to met my parents and family... But, ok the story it's not about him, it's about\
  \ me. While I was polishing the floor, I remembered that once I said: When I graduate\
  \ from college I will move to Los Roques, I'll work on a ship, sleep on a tent and\
  \ I'll stay there until I'm tanned and my hair it's burnt! Wow, it came to my mind\
  \ as a coin drops in the slot. How I could forgot that?\_\nAt that time the trending\
  \ cell phone was a blackberry, I worked for years at HP and I was the first one\
  \ in the company to have one on contrary to the rest of my coworkers. So I took\
  \ my cell and googled: Valentina Quintero (the best tour guide in Venezuela), then\
  \ I searched for the top 5 VIP Posadas in Los Roques and sent an email with my CV\
  \ attached. I remembered I felt adrenaline, and I called to my Bro. I told him:\
  \ Guess what? I'm moving to Paradise!\_\nFive days from that, I received a call\
  \ from an Italian woman that wanted to get together for an interview. The appointment\
  \ was in one of the best residences in the city. I was in my white Ford Coupe waiting\
  \ for her to come down and open the gate for me. She was blonde in her late fifties,\
  \ barefoot, wearing shorts and very tanned. She excused herself for being barefoot\
  \ because she had no shoes in the city. Much later I understood this, and I continued\
  \ her style.\_\nWe talked for hours, having a glass of iced coke with a lemon moon\
  \ on it. I thought it was fresh and delicious, and I decided this was what I needed\
  \ for rehab. This is the life I need to grab on to, in order to smile again.\_\n\
  One week later I was packing cloth for 15 days, I was frightened for the unexpected,\
  \ fearless for leaving home and making space from the person that I loved, learning\
  \ to not get attached to material things and at the same time excited for the new\
  \ adventure. I was accomplishing what I always said I would do and I blocked it\
  \ on my mind till that day I was watching Fool's Gold.\_\nFrom that day on I've\
  \ stayed five months, turning it to four years living literally in Paradise."
