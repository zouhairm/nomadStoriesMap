Text: "Strolling down the city made him wonder if there is any surf school on the\
  \ coastline. He came to the sunshine city, called Malaga, where the sun is shining\
  \ for 300 days of the year, situated in the southern part of Spain. His aim was\
  \ clear - he wanted to learn surfing.However, it seemed to be one of those \u201C\
  impossible-to-be-done\u201D tasks, because all of the surf schools localized in\
  \ the city suddenly disappeared of the face of the earth. Disappointed after the\
  \ all day long unfruitful search of the surfing school he came back to the hostel.\
  \ The receptionist, a young woman in her mid-twenties, was working on the computer\
  \ in the lounge. When he saw her, he thought that she might be his lifeline.And\
  \ he was right. There are no waves in Malaga! That\u2019s why there is hardly any\
  \ surfing school. She advised him to go to Tarifa, which is localized more or less\
  \ 2 hours from here by car. They have the cleanest beaches with a golden sand and,\
  \ what was more interesting for him - waves. With this weather, it is likely that\
  \ he could see the African land on the other side of the shore.It sounded like a\
  \ dream and he immediately started dreaming about the days which were about to come.\
  \ Suddenly he felt very hungry since he hasn\u2019t been eating for at least 5 hours.\
  \ He decided to grab a snack as soon as he was going to see any shop or a restaurant.\
  \ In that moment he saw an enormous queue in front of him.He went closer. Are they\
  \ giving out something for free or what\u2019s going on? He thought. He didn\u2019\
  t have right.The crowd was standing in a long queue to get an ice-cream in one of\
  \ the best ice-cream places in the whole city, named Conico. Because of the increasing\
  \ hunger, he decided to buy a big portion.He was looking around while eating, since\
  \ he was that type of guy who always needs to be active. From his perspective, something\
  \ needed to be going almost all the time, on in order to keep him awake and attentive.\
  \ He couldn\u2019t stand boredom. Even though it was late, he felt the hit of the\
  \ warmth wave on his whole body. 25 degrees in the middle of the night was a ridiculously\
  \ high temperature for him. As a fun of the mediterranean climate, he thought that\
  \ it\u2019s going to be a gorgeous time. And then, accidentally, he heard a conversation\
  \ in Polish on the street. After a while, we were sitting together on the terrace\
  \ drinking and chatting. I remember, that after telling me his story, he said, that\
  \ only the life with a strong dose of unpredictability is a real fun."
