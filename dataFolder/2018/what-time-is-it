Text: "A seagull snatched my sandwich as the ferry neared Mount Athos, an autonomous\
  \ monastic republik located on a peninsula in Greece. A heavy fragrance of olive\
  \ trees and pine lies in the searing hot july air. The silence is only interrupted\
  \ by the ecstatic chirping of a million crickets. The sea lies calm, seamlessly\
  \ melting into the sky. After hours of hiking the mountainous land, completely devoid\
  \ of roads, dramatically descending into the brilliantly blue Aegean, I\u2019m starting\
  \ to feel my stomach, nervously checking the time. \nLike a perfectly coordinated\
  \ orchestra, the crickets fall silent simultaneously. \u201CYou should have left\
  \ your watch at home\u201D, jokes Stamatis with a heavy Greek accent, pointing at\
  \ my wrist. \u201CTime works differently here.\u201D In this corner of the planet,\
  \ Byzantine time is still in use, where hour zero begins daily at sunset, a system\
  \ unheard of in the rest of the world since hundreds of years. \u201CThe world is\
  \ addicted to progress\u201D, Stamatis says rolling the Rs, while offering me a\
  \ hand to climb a rock from where to have a better view of the bombastic scenery.\
  \ \u201CBut when things get crazy like they do now, you come to appreciate what\u2019\
  s unbending.\u201D\nIt is maybe not the worst time to cherish old values. In the\
  \ exact moment my flight hit the runway of rainy Thessaloniki airport the day prior,\
  \ the Greek government restricted access to money nationwide due to a feared bank\
  \ run. Through the muddy windows of an aching bus carrying me to the remote port\
  \ city of Ouranopolis, I witnessed a country falling into chaos, \u201Ca nation\
  \ degraded to be no more than a yoghurt brand\u201D, as Stamatis puts it. The bus\
  \ smelled of gasoline and heated rubber. Worried faces flew by, men with machine\
  \ guns guarded every ATM. When the ferry left the harbour, half a day of travels\
  \ later, a monk with a massive white beard and impressive eyebrows turned to me\
  \ and laughingly shouted what I thought to mean: \u201EWhat a day to leave the world\
  \ behind!\u201C, and in that moment \u2013I shit you not\u2013 the clouds parted.\n\
  No women has set foot on Athos in a thousand years. The divine chants of the monks\
  \ hovering above the crystal waters are for the Holy Virgin Mary exclusively. We're\
  \ reaching a monastery that has the look of a middle age castle. Nobody\u2019s around.\
  \ Laundry lazily blowing in the breeze and the distant barking of a dog are the\
  \ only hints, that this place is inhabited. Spending time on Athos can make you\
  \ feel like the only person in the world, says Stamatis, putting his arm around\
  \ my shoulder."
