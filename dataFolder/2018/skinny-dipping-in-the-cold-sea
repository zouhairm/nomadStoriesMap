Text: "Last year, when visiting a friend who was living in the Netherlands, I decided\
  \ to check Brussels as well. And then thought \"why not take a flight to Copenhagen\
  \ for a quick visit as well?\".\nOne thing led to another, and before I knew how,\
  \ I was fascinated by the fact that after an all night pulled at Brussels airport,\
  \ I could land in Denmark, take a train in the airport and in less than half an\
  \ hour, be in Sweden.\nThree countries in one day. I wondered if I would enjoy every\
  \ single moment.\n I enjoyed even more than I had dreamed of.\nWith my big backpak\
  \ and cold than went into my bones in early march, I decided that as soon as I would\
  \ arrive in Malm\xF6, I would head straight into Ribersborg for a sauna and a skinny\
  \ dipping into the sea.\n I never did any of those.\n And probably two years ago\
  \ I wouldn't go for it, but something drove me to it. To step out of my comfort\
  \ zone. To check my personal edge and defy all odds.\n\n With a sore body and a\
  \ wonder mind, my personal GPS was on point. I found the place right away and felt\
  \ a sense of fullfilment that was yet to be discovered.\n I decided to go all swedish\
  \ in the sauna, which means butt naked. There, overlooking the water by the sauna\
  \ window, with big rocks decorating the tiny waves, I asked myself how cold would\
  \ the water be and if I would be able to swim.\n My mind was set - I would push\
  \ myself into new experiences and see what the world would bring into my life.\n\
  \ For a first time sauna user, the distance between the main building and the water\
  \ itself, was just to work my abs, laughing as hard as I could, excited as a kid\
  \ to jump in the water.\n I though I would freeze in motion, scared. No one was\
  \ in the water in that moment and it seemed as if a storm was coming down.\n But\
  \ I didn't, I just went for it.\n\n I drove myself to the edge and it was amazing.\
  \ Beyond all expectations.\n\n I made a point to dive my head as well, to feel it\
  \ all on my body. And a rush of energy went throught it all. It was astonishing.\n\
  \ In that moment, all my life decisions didn't seem so bad. They drove me there.\n\
  \ And all I could think was \"what took me so long?\"."
