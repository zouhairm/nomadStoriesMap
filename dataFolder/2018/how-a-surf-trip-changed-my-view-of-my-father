Text: "We sat, staring at the horizon, waiting for a set to come in. The whole time,\
  \ I couldn't help but question my dad\u2019s surf prowess.  Sure, my dad was the\
  \ one who taught me to surf on a warm October morning when I was ten years old.\
  \ A day that was highly memorable. Not just because I caught my first wave, but\
  \ because I was stung by a stingray and had to be rushed to the hospital. That was\
  \ over a decade ago, and my dad hadn\u2019t really surfed regularly since he was\
  \ in high school in the seventies\u2026 And now here we were, sitting in the ocean\
  \ in Costa Rica, amongst some formidabble waves, on a surf trip aimed at us reconnecting.\
  \ \nA set approached, I caught the first wave and hopped to my feet. It was a soft,\
  \ slow peeling right. I rode down the line and over the shoulder, turning out to\
  \ sea to paddle back out to the lineup. Just as I began to paddle, I saw something\
  \ that forever changed the way I view my dad. It was a silhouette, gliding down\
  \ the line on a chest high left, effortlessly cross-stepping on an old school single\
  \ fin log. As I got closer, I realized it was my dad.  I was in disbelief. This\
  \ was the man who I had seen most of my life in a coat and tie, darting across the\
  \ world, briefcase in hand in the most formal of ways. This was the man who seemed\
  \ to be most comfortable surrounded by work, morning meetings, and conference calls.\
  \ This man now seemed equally as comfortable in board shorts, sitting in the warm\
  \ Pacific Ocean taking part in what has long been viewed by society as the north\
  \ pole of irresponsibility, surfing.  \nThat wave set the tone for the trip. We\
  \ spent the rest of our days surfing hard, paddling out multiple times a day. Our\
  \ nights were spent tossing back beers at the Witch\u2019s Rock Volcano Brewery,\
  \ talking about the day\u2019s session, my dad\u2019s high school day\u2019s skipping\
  \ school and chasing waves, and my plans for the future. And after the trip, it\
  \ turns out my dad became one of my biggest supporters in my effort to turn travel\
  \ and surfing into part of my career. After all, he understood\u2014he was a surfer."
