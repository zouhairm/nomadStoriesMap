Text: "Climbing Teide, the tallest mountain in the Atlantic at 3719m, was both literally\
  \ and figuratively the peak of my stay in the Canary Islands, but the decision to\
  \ do it at night, in order to enjoy the legendary sunrise, made it a truly unique\
  \ experience. Before you get to the volcanic crater that watches over the island,\
  \ the road takes you through the Teide national park with its scenic views and breathtaking\
  \ landscapes. You pass nearly untouched forests and blooming alpine meadows and\
  \ rise above the cloud blanket to reach vast fields of petrified lava that, according\
  \ to different people, look like Mars, Mordor or\u2026Hell. Then, the actual adventure\
  \ starts. A steep, stony and seemingly never-ending path leads to the Altavista\
  \ refuge, where you spend the night and share a drink with daredevils from all over\
  \ the world before waking up in the middle of the night with only the flickering\
  \ stars and the moon above you, and start an almost 3 hour long hike to the to the\
  \ absolute top of a volcano that\u2019s not dead, it\u2019s just resting. Due to\
  \ my eternal sleeping problems, I got up when everyone else in the refuge was still\
  \ snoring so I decided to start the climb alone, in the freezing cold and oxygen\
  \ thin atmosphere, with only my phone flashlight to illuminate the path. As a passionate\
  \ skier and hiker, I always roll my eyes on those trying to conquer mountains with\
  \ inappropriate gear or clothing. This time, the guy wearing sneakers and a baseball\
  \ cap was me. When I decided to migrate to Tenerife for 3 months, I thought I would\
  \ be surfing in the ocean, under the sun, not climbing sharp rocks, at night. But\
  \ there I was, alone in the dark (luckily I don't believe in ghosts and monsters),\
  \ soaking up the most amazing night sky ever seen. As the path is steep and wild,\
  \ the climbing effort kept me warm but when I reached the peak before sunrise, totally\
  \ underdressed at temperatures well below the freezing point, I looked up the stinkiest\
  \ and greenest sulfur steam leak, like you often find them on volcanoes, to warm\
  \ myself up. The sun finally rose from behind the horizon, painting everything golden-red\
  \ and casting Teide\u2019s triangular shadow over the Atlantic. Breathtaking! Nobody\
  \ said a word, the only sounds you could hear were the occasional shutters of the\
  \ cameras. After most people left, I stayed a little longer to crack open a cold\
  \ one on the summit of the volcano and cellebrate like a real douche wearing sneakers\
  \ and a baseball cap on the tallest mountain in the Atlantic."
