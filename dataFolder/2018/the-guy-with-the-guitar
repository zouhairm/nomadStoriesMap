Text: "It\u2019s May 29, 2017. 9 pm. Walking through a ghost-like Paris, Jack Johnson\
  \ coming though my headphones, I realize just how empty the space around me is.\
  \ And how strange it feels to pass empty corner cafes and neighborhood restaurants\
  \ on such a warm spring night. \n\nOn nights like these, every passing stranger\
  \ seems like\_a friend in this city of two million. A guy walks by me with his two\
  \ skinny Greyhounds and I feel the urge to smile and say bonsoir - in my broken\
  \ French - as if we've done this every night for months. \n\nWalking through this\_\
  empty city, I feel like I belong.\_\n\nAnd yet, on nights like these, I feel the\
  \ loneliest. The silence of the city resounds deep within me.\_\n\nThere is a muteness\
  \ to my universe - the type of\_quietness that allows one to hear one\u2019s own\
  \ soul. It's the kind of silence that makes you reflect, dig deep and hear your\
  \ inner whispers.\_On nights like these, when streets are stripped from their usual\
  \ buzzing of sounds and smells, I realize that everyone is chasing their own happiness\
  \ and dreams.\_\n\n\LAs I turn the corner on La Republique, the noise finally catches\
  \ up with me. I turn down the volume of my Spotify to hear Romeo Santos playing\
  \ as couples are dancing bachata in this big square in the heart of Paris. A few\
  \ steps down, boys are playing soccer to the beats of French rap. Beggars approach\
  \ me. I bump into a tall French lady. Pardon, I say, as she looks sternly at me\
  \ and continues her way. \n\nIn the midst of this craziness, I spot a guy in a hat,\
  \ sitting alone on a bench playing\_his guitar. I now stop the music from my headphones\
  \ and try to hear the sounds coming from his guitar. Something about him intrigues\
  \ me. He is playing soft tunes, creating a calm, cozy atmosphere in the whirlwind\
  \ of sounds around him. \n\nI marvel at his ability to be so calm, so grounded,\
  \ when the world around him is in such a rush and movement. He seems to care only\
  \ for the sounds of his guitar. \n\nAnd it is on nights like these that I realize\
  \ the importance of building an empire - strong and sound - within oneself. For\
  \ oneself.\_I think of the importance of creating an aura of self-acceptance, love\
  \ and coziness inside one\u2019s soul. Just like the guy with the guitar sitting\
  \ in La Republique, I want to be able to find serenity in the midst of a storm.\
  \ And the way to do is, it seems to me as I walk through Paris,\_is to mute the\
  \ world around you, hear the whispers of your soul and find the instrument that\
  \ creates your own world of serenity, love and acceptance."
