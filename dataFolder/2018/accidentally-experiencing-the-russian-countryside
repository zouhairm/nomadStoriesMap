Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s full of wolves!\u201D\n\nThe local\u2019s warning about the\
  \ surrounding forest had been insistent. I was two hours from Perm, a traditional\
  \ last stop in the Russian Urals before the vast expanse of Siberia, and I wasn\u2019\
  t supposed to be here. While my travel companions had gone to visit the local ice\
  \ caves, my fascination with Russian history meant I preferred a trip to the last\
  \ preserved Gulag, now The Museum of the History of Political Repression.\n\nVisiting\
  \ something officially secret for most of its existence is tricky, as directions\
  \ are at best vague. I was to take a bus through the countryside for \u201Ca while\u201D\
  , until I saw \u201Ca track\u201D, which I should follow on foot. Of course, there\
  \ were multiple tracks leading through the forest from the single country road,\
  \ and, now acutely aware of the resident wolf population, I was hesitant to take\
  \ the wrong one. My second-guessing was eventually brought to an end as the forest\
  \ thinned and we entered a small town: the end of the line.\n\nI walked disorientated\
  \ around the bus station until a man sitting in a well-worn car caught my eye and\
  \ waved enthusiastically. \u201CYou need a lift? Come on!\u201D Though in Russia,\
  \ driving strangers around for tips is common, I hesitated. I was alone, and hardly\
  \ intimidating. I asked him to wait, and checked at the kiosk for my options. \u201C\
  You could wait a few hours for a bus, or get a lift. Hey, have you met Yuri?\u201D\
  \ the attendant pointed back at my new acquaintance, who responded with a thumbs\
  \ up.\n\nYuri had hundreds of questions, and was shocked that this was my first\
  \ time in the Ural region. \u201CI must show you everything!\u201D he said excitedly.\
  \ My protestations were ignored as we veered off the paved road to follow a river,\
  \ stopping at his favorite fishing spots. We visited his birthplace, drank his favorite\
  \ orange juice at his local produkti \u2013 or corner shop \u2013 and saw the hall\
  \ where he took dance lessons. He spoke of how he wished he could always be here,\
  \ and not in the town, but his daughter had become chronically sick, and his tiny\
  \ village lacked medical resources. His car interior was plastered with pictures\
  \ of his daughter in dance costumes, and his face beamed with pride as he explained\
  \ how she still danced with him, when \u201Cthe pain is not too bad\u201D.\n\nThree\
  \ hours later, we arrived at the museum. We hugged as I thanked him for his impromptu\
  \ tour. \u201CThere is more here than Gulags!\u201D he yelled enthusiastically as\
  \ he bounded up to the museum staff, and began regaling them with his most recent\
  \ gossip."
