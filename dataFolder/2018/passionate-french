Text: "When you visit Paris for the third time you already have some mini-traditions\
  \ such as: take selfie with Mona Liza by the fence, take weird anti-tourist photo\
  \ by the Eifel Tower and have a French caf\xE9 au lait at Caf\xE9 de Flor, where\
  \ Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir had their date nights. \nOne day I decided that\
  \ I know enough French to act as a \u201Cparisienne\u201D and took off the regular\
  \ route, armed with a map, started to explore local sights. \nWhen I was at Caf\xE9\
  \ de Flor I was all smiling and talking French to people when the guy came to me\
  \ with a helmet and started giving me all these compliments and proposing me to\
  \ be his wife (and they say that Italians are amorous!). As I was open to any adventures,\
  \ I offered to him as a joke to take me on a ride on his motorbike to show me secret\
  \ places. And that\u2019s how I got my personal handsome guide in Paris! We were\
  \ flirting as there was no tomorrow, but I had to say bye to him to enjoy my solo\
  \ diner by the Eifel Tower. When we finally separated I headed to the small local\
  \ shops by the river to taste the real \u201Cescargots\u201D (which is oysters)-\
  \ never mind that they are delicious, the word itself is so fancy and I was eager\
  \ to use it and enjoy the glass of wine with it by la Seine river. \nSo my day was\
  \ coming to an end and I was walking on the quay and guess who I bumped into \u2013\
  \ the guy with a bike! So we had our last conversations and were about to find each\
  \ other on the social media, when unexpected thing happened \u2013 some girl jumped\
  \ out of nowhere and started yelling and beating that poor guy. Then she noticed\
  \ that I was there and she started yelling on me in French (obviously) and it was\
  \ so fast and loud, I could hardly distinguish the words but could definitely understand\
  \ the bad words coming out her mouth. It was very funny when I had to stop her and\
  \ say \u201CCould you please repeat more slowly and maybe with less emotions because\
  \ I don\u2019t speak French that well?\u201D. I guess that explained all her worries\
  \ and she smiled because she was his ex girlfriend/ friend (yes, French are also\
  \ open the same way as Americans in relationships) and there was no doubt that anything\
  \ could ever happen between me and that \u201Cguide\u201D. \nSo that was my story\
  \ of learning about how passionate French can be and how delicious their food can\
  \ be along with the servers proud to be working in bistro."
