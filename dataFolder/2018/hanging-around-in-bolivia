Text: "The sight of a human figure hung from a power pole gets your attention.\n\n\
  I thought my eyes had played tricks on me when I first glimpsed one in Juliaca,\
  \ Peru. This time I\u2019d had a long look as I crawled through traffic in the Bolivian\
  \ city of El Alto. There was no mistaking the shabbily dressed form. As much as\
  \ I hoped the effigy remained from a festival, I suspected the truth was much more\
  \ macabre.\n\nDays later I sat in a tiny La Paz bar amid swirls of cigarette smoke\
  \ and jazz. The only tourist, I chatted with the owner, Luisa. In a lull in the\
  \ conversation I seized the moment and asked about the effigies.\n\n\u201CPeople\
  \ use them to warn criminals that they don\u2019t call the police. That\u2019s what\
  \ will happen if they catch them,\u201D she replied. Unprompted, she continued with\
  \ a tale of their origin.\n\nIt was the late eighties. Luisa was a girl of seven\
  \ living in El Alto. One afternoon her family went with most of their neighbourhood\
  \ to a local football match. Five men used the opportunity to burgle some of the\
  \ empty homes. Unluckily for them they were spotted, and word spread to those at\
  \ the match. A mob formed, rounded them up and dragged them back to the football\
  \ ground for some rough justice.\n\nWhat form of punishment they intended has long\
  \ been lost to time. With a furious crowd spurring them on, the mob lost control.\
  \ Rope was found, and the punishment took the form of a lynching, the goals as makeshift\
  \ gallows. To complete their revenge, the mob burned the lifeless bodies where they\
  \ hung.\n\nVengeance though was costly for the vigilantes, who were arrested and\
  \ jailed for many years. It did, however, send a message to criminals, who avoided\
  \ the neighbourhood. Other communities learnt of the lynching and its effect in\
  \ deterring criminals. As a result, they began hanging effigies in prominent places\
  \ to warn that similar treatment could be expected.\n\nThe story\u2019s brutality\
  \ stung me. As did Luisa\u2019s seeming ambivalence to what she had seen as a child.\
  \ It was at odds with the friendliness shown by Bolivians I\u2019d met. Was it just\
  \ an urban legend? Her earnest account suggested not. Perhaps it was a product of\
  \ the social, political and economic turmoil in that period of the country\u2019\
  s history. I struggled further with the idea that mob justice may still happen.\
  \ I consoled my pampered first world sensibilities that every country has its dark\
  \ underbelly. I chose not to judge and simply continued to enjoy Bolivia\u2019s\
  \ warm hospitality over the coming weeks. Its hanging effigies and all."
