Text: "Breathing should be the simplest task, being able to breathe is natural and\
  \ comes to people by instinct. The one thing that should be the easiest to do seem\
  \ to be the hardest thing to do, in this moment all I wanted to do was curl up in\
  \ a ball and hide away from the world. In my room, I could breathe a little easier,\
  \ in my room I was alone it was also the one place where I couldn\u2019t hide, where\
  \ the same question seemed to be circling in my mind, \u201Cwhen am I going to say\
  \ it? is there a label for that? Do I even need a label? how am I going to tell\
  \ her?\u201D when one question ended another began and it seemed to be on repeat\
  \ never letting me rest never letting me answer. \n\nDays later my dad knows by\
  \ New Year\u2019s Eve and now challenging myself to tell her the one person I never\
  \ want to disappoint the one person I\u2019m scared will disregard me, my mom. Another\
  \ week passed and I'm at my mom's house waiting for the right time to tell her,\
  \ my heart banging in my chest she right beside me but seemed to oblivious to my\
  \ agony. About to speak the words at the tip of my tongue about to spill my heart\
  \ out in one single sentence but a ringing sound fills the room the feeling relief\
  \ and anxiety filled me, and my mom halts any further conversation because work\
  \ seemed to call her in. Around the time Friday came my heart wasn't so scared,\
  \ my mom was going to work and I wanted to tell her trying to look for a fun way\
  \ to tell her the truth, maybe in a cup, a shirt. I didn\u2019t want to wait so\
  \ a good joke would have to do. \n\nMom, want to hear a joke? I texted her.\n\n\
  Who is the joke? She texted back.\n\nMy dating life, I\u2019m all bi myself and\
  \ sent a pride flag.\n\nI waited what seemed to be forever trying to calm my beating\
  \ heart asking myself why the heck I seemed to think this was a good idea again\
  \ pacing back and forth finding it hard to breath. Then a bing resonated against\
  \ the walls letting me know she texted back, the woman whom has always been my rock,\
  \ the one who seemed to think that I could go farther than what I thought, the one\
  \ person I'm afraid to disappoint.  \n\nNot cute she said.\n\nSo savage mom, I texted\
  \ back. \n\nFinally, it seemed to be easy to breathe again where the world didn't\
  \ seem to be hanging on my shoulders and that\u2019s the last thing I expected me\
  \ and mom to say as I came out as Bisexual. Maybe I will go to a center that could\
  \ help me adjust, or maybe I'll go to this year pride parade, I don't know what\
  \ will happen next but I know I am glad to know I'm not alone."
