Text: "\"Do you see any women here?\" was my first question to Shannon my American\
  \ pal as soon as we reached Manikarnika ghat in Varanasi. Shannon way over six feet\
  \ looked around and shook her head in negation. Walking down the \"city of lights\"\
  \ at night one becomes attuned to the vibrant atmosphere of the ghats with bells\
  \ chiming, chanting prayers and lit lamps floating on the Ganges as an offering\
  \ to the goddess Ganga. Dozen burning bodies and somber men gathered at Manikarnika\
  \ ghat was a stark contrast to the earlier ghats. The apparent absence of women\
  \ reminded me of the long followed Indian tradition of women not allowed at the\
  \ cremation site and hence being the only two women in a sea of men. It took me\
  \ aback that this tradition is still prevalent today, the various reasons offered\
  \ ranged from salvation can be achieved only when male lineage lights the pyre,\
  \ evil spirit can possess the delicate female body or to take care of all the visiting\
  \ relatives at home. Last reasoning sounded closer to the truth. All this sounded\
  \ bizarre to me, since I remembered that in Mahabharata (literary epic) women did\
  \ attend cremation for instance in case of Bhishma.\n\nNext morning approaching\
  \ the ghats from the Ganges were a delight, people taking a dip in the holy water\
  \ of Ganges, pedestrian sharing the same lane with a herd of cows, and us traipsing\
  \ through maze of cremation pyres. In daylight, the apparent division of casetism\
  \ was visible in the hierarchy layering of the funeral pyres. The business of last\
  \ rites runs like a well-oiled machine, cost of wood varies as per body weight.\
  \ The requirement for wood burdens the Himalayan forests, but electric crematorium\
  \ nearby seemed to be closed most of the time. This made me accept my good fortune\
  \ of living in an urban city where electricity is taken for granted. Leaving me\
  \ with the question of \u201CWould Manikarnika jolt me if no bodies were burning\
  \ there?\u201D if all electric crematorium were working, would the ghats still provide\
  \ the same experience of vibrancy, mystery, and somberness. Being a conervation\
  \ architect, the relation of tangible and intangible elements fascinates me. Meanwhile\
  \ our frail looking chaiwala (tea vendor) pulled me away from my pondering. He said,\
  \ \u201CThis year I feel close to achieving moksha (salvation) since my funeral\
  \ kitty is full\u201D."
