Text: "I was alone. A true vagabond at last. Phone networks had abandoned me hours\
  \ ago. Vodafone would tell my mum I was unreachable. Or perhaps that my phone\u2019\
  s off. How do they figure which was the case?\nIt was Day 1 of my trek in the Ladakhi\
  \ mountains. I went solo. Not advisable. But I had just run a full marathon in Ladakh.\
  \ I was invincible.\nA stream ran between the gorge and I hiked on a trail marked\
  \ along its walls. They were identical, the walls. But the trail had commitment\
  \ issues. It jumped between the two, on a whim, crisscrossing the stream. Each time\
  \ I came out on the other side, I feared losing the trail. But I was grateful to\
  \ the ponies who\u2019d splattered the entire route with poo. And to that hiker\
  \ with weird soles \u2013 two sets of concentric circles on each foot. Maybe I\u2019\
  d run into him at \u2013\n\u201CYurutse?\u201D I enquired after the village I was\
  \ headed to.\nThe gorge had opened into a valley and a lone old man was tending\
  \ to some rather hairy cows. He divulged a lot of words in Ladakhi, but from his\
  \ hand gestures I gathered the village was behind that mountain over there and should\
  \ take two hours to reach.\nA trek is not as elementary as it would seem, I nodded\
  \ to myself; in the expanse of the valley the trail had begun forking away, unable\
  \ to handle all the freedom.\nI kept the mountain in sight and followed the trails\
  \ that pointed there. My urban brain struggled with the sense of scale. What seemed\
  \ ten minutes away took an hour to reach. And then the gentle gradient began.\n\
  I was low on water now. Two (three?) sips low. And though sundown was a little way\
  \ off, the sun had tucked itself behind my mountain. The temperature dropped. I\
  \ could feel the rising altitude in my lungs. My steps got shorter, slower.\nI stopped.\
  \ There were no circular footprints in the poo. It was past two hours. The trail\
  \ went on and disappeared around the mountain.\nWas I lost?\nThen - \u201CKoi hai?\u201D\
  \ I yelled out to the valley. I giggled foolishly. Ten seconds later, \u201CKoi\
  \ hai?\u201D I yelled out more urgently.\nI was truly alone. The mountains looked\
  \ hostile. Huge mounds of dirt. I was going to die.\nThink. I could keep to the\
  \ trail, that led where? Or head back? The last village was six hours away. I finished\
  \ my water.\nI took a deep breath of oxygen-poor air and began walking. I\u2019\
  d go on, at least up till that bend. My lungs stopped me every 25 steps for refills.\n\
  After forever, I turned around the bend.\nThe sun was there, beaming down at the\
  \ most beautiful place in Ladakh \u2013 the one-house haven, Yurutse."
