Text: "White paint covered the revelers faces, intricate black lines swirled like\
  \ flowers and curly cues around eyes, each face a delicate skeleton. People were\
  \ cloaked in black and a few carried lit candles, their faces glowing in the dark\
  \ night. It was November 2nd, Dia de los Muertos, in the Mission District of San\
  \ Francisco, CA. The streets were closed for a parade leading to Garfield Park for\
  \ an annual remembrance of those that had passed. While images of death surrounded\
  \ us on all sides, there was no fear here. Music echoed, different bands marching\
  \ in matching skeleton costumes, the sound of drums, maracas, or the strum of a\
  \ handheld harp. The smell of deep fried pork fat and corn roasting wafted down\
  \ the city streets. A man on stilts hovered over the crowd walking like a delicate\
  \ daddy long leg across the scores of on-lookers. The crowd swayed and danced as\
  \ it snaked through the city.\nI clutch the photo in my hand, feeling the edges\
  \ of it curl towards my fingers as it sits in my pocket. My grandmother has only\
  \ just passed away from cancer in May and my brother and I join the throng to deliver\
  \ her image to the Festival of Altars, a large, communal ofrenda, in the park. We\
  \ are carried away by the stream of the dead, the eerie shadows, white corsets,\
  \ flowing lace making the idea of spirits come back to life feel all the more real.\
  \ \nWe grow closer to the park. The grassy knolls are covered with people, holding\
  \ hands, leaning over altars, kissing, take pictures. There is no debauchery here,\
  \ no drunken teenagers or girls in sexy cop uniforms or sexy anything. This is both\
  \ solemn and joyful and the mixture of both is unexpected and welcomed. We find\
  \ a tree covered with loved ones faces. Battery powered candles flicker at the base\
  \ of the tree. This is the one, this is right. We tuck our grandmother\u2019s picture\
  \ behind the corners of two others. We stand for a moment saying nothing. She would\
  \ have liked this event, watching the people, wandering through the altars, putting\
  \ a bright orange marigold in her hair. We leave her at her tree and make our way\
  \ amongst the altars. Flowers are laid out on antique mirrors. Pictures in gilt\
  \ frames are stacked in cluttered rows. We stop by our grandmother\u2019s tree one\
  \ last time, place our fingers to her picture and then leave her behind, with all\
  \ the others who have been loved and lost and will continue to linger each night\
  \ on November 2nd and in our hearts."
