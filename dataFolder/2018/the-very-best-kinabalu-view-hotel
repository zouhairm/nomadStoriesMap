Text: "Doing business in Borneo was a peculiar affair. A hire car was acquired by\
  \ meeting a man outside a supermarket, checking into a remote jungle campground\
  \ was via a laundromat.\_So, I was not surprised when a stay in\_the Kinabalu Holiday\
  \ Camp Hotel first involved meeting a man named Oliver outside of the local bank.\n\
  \nI had been up since 2 am to reach the summit of Borneo\u2019s highest mountain,\
  \ Mount Kinabalu. It was now a typically hot and humid afternoon in dusty downtown\
  \ Ranau and I desperately needed a shower from the morning\u2019s exertions. I was\
  \ relieved when an old sedan finally rolled up and the man introduced himself as\
  \ Oliver.\n\n\u201CYou are my first Australian!\u201D claimed Oliver.\n\nWith Australian\u2019\
  s being quite the travelling bunch I was curious, \u201CHow many guests have you\
  \ had?\u201D\n\n\u201CI have had six guests!\u201D he proudly replied.\n\nI cautiously\
  \ tailed Oliver into the mountains. We wound through the thick green forest along\
  \ a rutted gravel road. Occasionally we passed the vandalised remains of homes,\
  \ inhabited now by only the fast-growing forest which was intent on claiming back\
  \ its land. Stray packs of dogs were the only life to be seen, darting off the road\
  \ when we approached.\n\nWe came to a locked gate thirty minutes later, a sign written\
  \ in Malay was illegible to me apart from a menacing skull and cross bone symbol\
  \ at the top. My senses on edge, I continued through the gate as Oliver carefully\
  \ locked it behind us.\n\n\u201CNot far now!\u201D he called excitedly.\n\nTill\
  \ what, my silent response.\n\nTrue to his word, we shortly arrived at Oliver\u2019\
  s camp. Four basic wooden cottages with steep roofs were lined in a row. They were\
  \ each connected by a thin boardwalk over a small pond covered in wildflowers. Behind\
  \ the cottages, from this clearing in the forest, was the most amazing view of Mount\
  \ Kinabalu I\u2019d had the entire day. Clouds framed the jagged summit that I had\
  \ stood on less than 8 hours earlier.\n\nOliver purchased the land from the previous\
  \ tenants, a Japanese copper mine. He had put his stake in the ground early to secure\
  \ this site for an expected tourism boom. Having previously been an artist for many\
  \ years and with his children now in university on the mainland, this was Oliver\u2019\
  s own self-made retirement plan.\n\nAs the only guest for the night, I admired his\
  \ ambition and drive much more than the view. And, while I still may be eaten in\
  \ the night, if not by Oliver then certainly by mosquitos, I was proud to be the\
  \ seventh person to experience his special place in the jungle."
