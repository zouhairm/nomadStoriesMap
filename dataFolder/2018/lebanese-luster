Text: "When one thinks Lebanon, the immediate thoughts involve delicious cuisine,\
  \ unrivaled nightlife and the intimate beauties of Beirut. Of course, this is the\
  \ narrative punted to pull tourists but the essence of Lebanon is lost in the pandering.\n\
  \nPlagued by years of war, occupation, cultural cross-pollination and economic inequality,\
  \ the foundations of the country, hailed once as the Paris of the Middle East, are\
  \ based on incredible stories of passion and resistance. From food to parties, everything\
  \ known about Lebanon is based on this.\n\nTravelling through the country guided\
  \ by context, I ventured to find out how its turbulent past makes for its tumultuous\
  \ future; why raw meat? Why do monks distill wine?\n\nFrom military check points\
  \ to shopping centers, one will not pass a building without the flag, or many, on\
  \ it. That patriotism splinters there though as various religious sects have differing\
  \ ideas for solving Lebanon's problems. Following the path of the Maronite order,\
  \ I made for Annaya, famed monetary of Lebanese legend, Saint Charbel.\n\nThe Saint\
  \ was an avid hiker, more out of compulsion than hobby but hiking through the Lebanese\
  \ mountains, I learned quickly that the Maronites were people of the rebound. Facing\
  \ death daily for continuing to practice their belief, they needed to seek refuge\
  \ and they found it in the mountains.If nearing detection, they'd move to the next\
  \ one. The entire culture is based on fleeing the Ottoman Empire and has seeped\
  \ through to contemporary Lebanese culture today. \n\nThis is why the lost beauty\
  \ of Lebanon is really in the mountains.\n\nThey would hide in caves, prepare food\
  \ without fire and were determined to protect their sacraments. Monasteries were\
  \ built into mountainsides to avoid notice wine was produced in a similar veiled\
  \ state. Like many disappointed Christian teenagers today, they must have asked,\
  \ \"What good is the Eucharist if you only have bread?\"\n\nAs I sipped on a glass\
  \ of award-winning Ksara Cab Sav, I couldn't help but realize that this wine is\
  \ a product of adapting to incredibly harsh and life threatening circumstance to\
  \ fulfill a belief...a belief that, generations down the line, is now fulfilling\
  \ a national identity. Equally, the cuisine, now famed the world over, was borne\
  \ out of a make-do-with-what-we-have set of circumstances.\n\nComing back to a new-found\
  \ understanding of real reestablishment in the face of sudden failure or even death,\
  \ the lesson Lebanon teaches is that there is always a future to run towards."
