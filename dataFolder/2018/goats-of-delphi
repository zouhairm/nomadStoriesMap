Text: "As I walked the winding dusty path up the mountain I could feel the warm salty\
  \ breeze blowing up from the sea far below. I did not meet any other humans along\
  \ the path, but I did see signs of habitation in the form of ancient looking huts\
  \ and groves of cultivated trees. The air was invigorating and the silence was heavy.\n\
  \ When I arrived in Delphi that morning, I had lunch in a taverna, where the proprietor\
  \ told me that the mountains in this area were the domain of Pan, the mischievous\
  \ goat-man hybrid god of the ancient Greeks. According to local legends Pan has\
  \ a home on one of them. \n I hadn't seen any sign of Pan on the journey yet, but\
  \ the mountains and the ancient farms nestled in shaded valleys did have a solemn\
  \ and almost sacred air to them. When I finally reached the end of the path, the\
  \ expansive views of the mountains and the natural harbor below were even more breathtaking\
  \ than I had hoped. I sat for a long time in quiet meditation while gazing out onto\
  \ the timeless scene. \n I had closed my eyes for a short time to just feel the\
  \ warm breeze on my face, when I sensed that I was no longer alone. I opened my\
  \ eyes, expecting to see a couple of hikers who had just made the   trek. Instead\
  \ I saw a wizened but majestic looking old mountain goat sitting next to me and\
  \ looking at the same view I had been pondering. Its nose was upturned into the\
  \ sea breeze, its eyes half-closed, absorbed in its own form of meditation. It turned\
  \ to meet my eyes briefly, nodding at me before returning its gaze to the sea. I\
  \ did the same, but quickly realized that it was not a loan goat, but rather a herd\
  \ of eight or nine goats that were sitting all around me in the same way, quietly\
  \ looking to the sea. We all sat there still for a while, and then the goats gently\
  \ stood up in unison and meandered off down the steep and craggy mountainside together.\n\
  \ When I got back down to the bottom I met a young Greek man wearing a ripped Metallica\
  \ t-shirt, who asked me if I had seen any goats on the mountain. I told him about\
  \ the herd I had just met. He thanked me and then proceeded to walk straight up\
  \ the mountain, ignoring the paths and covering the same distance in fifteen minutes\
  \ that had taken me almost 3 hours on the trails. He walked up the sheer cliffs\
  \ with the skill and agility of a goat man himself. About 3 quarters of the way\
  \ up he ran into the group of goats I had met at the top. I returned to town with\
  \ the feeling that maybe Pan's spirit does roam these mountains after all."
