Text: "Being a product of the 70\u2019s I feel as a generation we still have a sense\
  \ of adventure to throw caution into the wind and I think if more people tapped\
  \ into that whether you are 15 or 75 life does treat you to experiences you can\u2019\
  t pay for.  New York City up to the 90\u2019s had a reputation of drugs, gangs,\
  \ and violence.  In 2006 I decided to go with my pregnant sister and our children\
  \ to check it out. New York is love at first bite.  The many recognizable film locations\
  \ along with unique smells of every food imaginable the city grabs you by the heart\
  \ and holds tight.\n\nOur first trip to the famous Canal Street was one of surprise\
  \ and good fortune. We decided to check out the deals to be found on designer bags\
  \ and perfume we had heard so much about. With a bagel clutched in hand we shuffled\
  \ along the noisy crowded streets filled with bargains, tourists and locals we had\
  \ a woman cautiously pass by whispering \u201Cbags!\u201D under her breath.  Well,\
  \ of course, we are intrigued so we say yes and ask where her store is.  As she\
  \ looks us over she speaks into her walkie-talkie and then instructs us to follow\
  \ her.\n\nShe was not big on talking but she beckoned us to follow her down a dodgy\
  \ side street at a pretty quick pace.  I say quickly but I have been told my normal\
  \ gait is about as fast as the continental drift. As we now head down the street\
  \ we come upon a building with stairs leading down to a basement.  My sister takes\
  \ one look and flat out refuses to even contemplate entering.  Always up for an\
  \ adventure my daughter and I charge down to the unknown.\n\nWhile my sister paced\
  \ outside the entrance my daughter and I feasted our eyes on designer bags all crammed\
  \ into two rooms.  We were greeted by a petite woman named Sherry that offered us\
  \ coffee. She had by her side a young boy named Oscar so while my daughter took\
  \ over entertaining him his mother and I perused the merchandise picking out favourites.\
  \  Outside my sister paced imagining all kinds of unknown horrors being inflicted\
  \ upon us but within minutes she came down to crash the party.\n\nAfter another\
  \ coffee and a chat we grabbed our booty with her business card and headed out back\
  \ to Canal St.  Not long after we hear someone screaming LADY! I had forgotten my\
  \ wallet full of my holiday money in her \u201Cstore\u201D and she ran full speed\
  \ down the street to return it. If you get out and give people a chance you can\
  \ make friends while also giving you a snapshot of what it\u2019s like being a native\
  \ even if it\u2019s only for a New York minute."
