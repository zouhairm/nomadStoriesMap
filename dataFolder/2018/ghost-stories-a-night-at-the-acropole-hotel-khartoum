Text: "The final round of applause was bittersweet, one final bow and we were leaving\
  \ for a farewell dinner. Turned out Hermy learnt a few more Sudanese phrases that\
  \ I have never used before.We head back to the hotel for a sleepover with Ethiopia\
  \ team. \n We decided to hang out on the balcony. The sky was clear and sprinkled\
  \ with countless stars. We were immersed in silence; it felt so unnatural to speak\
  \ at that moment. I thought maybe we were all drugged.\nA few hours in absolute\
  \ silence and we grew at ease with its presence!\n- \u201CThis hotel feels so much\
  \ like my grandmother\u2019s house in north Sudan\u201D\n-\u201CKhadiga, you look\
  \ younger than your age!\u201D\n-\u201CYeah, I remember when I was young I had a\
  \ drink from the fountain of youth, or was it an enchanted well in the north I don\u2019\
  t remember, I just hope the spell does not wear off!\u201D\n- \u201CSamah was not\
  \ born when the first issue of WITCH girls was released.\u201D\n- \u201CAmal believes\
  \ she saw a ghost once or twice in her life!\u201D \n- \u201CHow innocent!\u201D\
  \n-\u201CWait! Did you see that? A draft of air drifted the Scorpius constellation\
  \ to the west. I don\u2019t understand how that is possible but it\u2019s either\
  \ that or the hotel across the street moved closer to us!\u201D\n-\u201Cwell, that\
  \ does not prove that ghosts exist. And although I once caught my slippers, casually,\
  \ walking around the house, I still don\u2019t believe in ghosts. I really think\
  \ that there is a scientific explanation to every phenomenon that we rush to label\
  \ as paranormal.\u201D\n-\u201CI hear voices coming from the window across the street.\u201D\
  \n-\u201CThere is no one there.\u201D\n-\u201CI am telling you someone is inside\
  \ and I can hear them moving around.\u201D\n-\u201CThe room is empty the whole place\
  \ looks abandoned.\u201D\nThe sun is rising, it\u2019s a fresh day.\nThe nice butler\
  \ offered us coffee. We go inside.\nI still don\u2019t believe in ghosts, but I\
  \ do believe in magic and all magical beings. I believe in my grandmother\u2019\
  s love coming to life in this place, finding home in the fresh milk in my coffee.\
  \ I believe in the power of love, all the hugs I received that healed me one broken\
  \ piece at a time. I cast a spell on all your sleepy heads and send sweet dreams\
  \ your way. You know what? I think I've grown younger over this night.\nI leave\
  \ and I was blessed.\nMorning is here,\nThree figures in the hotel across the street\
  \ whispering:\u201D Do you see, they stopped talking, I told you ghosts only appear\
  \ at night\u201D\nP.S: that slipper I caught walking on its own, there was a huge\
  \ bug stuck underneath and it was dragging it."
