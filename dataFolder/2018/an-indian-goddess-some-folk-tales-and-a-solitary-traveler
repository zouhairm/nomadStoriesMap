Text: "I stood at the corner of the road, sipping on some hot ginger tea, feeling\
  \ it warm up my throat and gut. Yesterday, I was on the verge of cancelling my plan\
  \ and heading back home, yet here I was waiting for my guide to take me on a trek\
  \ to Shenbaga Devi falls, located in Courtallam, South of India. I had no idea what\
  \ made me stay back to pursue this trek. Something was pushing me to do so. \nThe\
  \ locals hold this place with high regards owing to its mythical values. They believe\
  \ the place to be an epitome of positivity as it was home to a Goddess (Durga Devi)\
  \ who is believed to reside in a temple here. I\u2019m not a big believer in mythology\
  \ but was curious listening to their stories. I was told that each person who visits\
  \ this place would have a story to go back with. \nAfter reaching, I sat at the\
  \ foot of the falls, absorbing all it had to offer. The falls curved into a forceful\
  \ spiral and flowed down as a stream that led to another falls as it reached the\
  \ edge. Carefully observing the anatomy of the falls, I spotted a couple happily\
  \ swimming on the other side of the stream.  \nSuddenly the water level of the stream\
  \ rose above six feet within minutes. The force of the water was becoming uncontrollable.\
  \ The couple needed help. They had to cross the stream to reach our side. My heart\
  \ was racing fast. I ran down screaming for help. A group of youngsters offered\
  \ to help. \nBy the time we reached, the couple had managed to cross half the stream.\
  \ However, unable to withhold the force of the water, the lady slowly lost grip.\
  \ In a jiffy, she got pushed almost to the edge of the stream which led to the subsequent\
  \ waterfall. There was pitch silence for a second, we were praying for her to not\
  \ be washed by the water. \nShe held a rock but was slowly slipping away. We had\
  \ to act quickly.\nWe all instantly formed a human chain holding a tree for support.\
  \ We asked the man to swim past the swirl and reach our side. He did that and joined\
  \ the end of the human chain, holding the lady\u2019s arm. With one blow of power,\
  \ we pulled her to our side. We saved a life by merely being present. I was just\
  \ imagining the scene if we had not been there. Observing the happiness on the couple\u2019\
  s faces, it felt surreal. I had goosebumps and cold sweat. It just felt right, my\
  \ reason for existence. That unmatched feeling of doing something unexpected.\n\
  The lady and man thanked us. As I walked back, I visited the temple, looked at the\
  \ deity and smiled. \"Thanks for making me part of this story!\""
