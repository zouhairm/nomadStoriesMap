Text: "After all these years of traveling I still feel like a stranger in strange\
  \ land and countries do not come any stranger than India. A beautiful country full\
  \ of adventure with a surprise around every corner. Coming off the night train from\
  \ Jodhpur I arrived in Udaipur early in the morning. As always, I didn't sleep during\
  \ the trip. Udaipur is known as the White City and I headed to a highly recommended\
  \ hotel, which was completely booked. Across the street a new hotel had opened its\
  \ doors merely days ago and I checked in there. For India, the intense smell of\
  \ fresh paint is a welcome change.\nThat moment I decided to explore the city before\
  \ anything else. I should have taken a nap. Mere minutes later I strolled through\
  \ the streets, had a late breakfast and felt the searing heat of Indian climate\
  \ slowly reaching that day's climax.\nAfter a second mango lassi I moved on, a bit\
  \ more invigorated, but still tired. Maybe that's why I didn't notice the danger\
  \ storming at me from the left. A hulking mass came closer. Since my brain processed\
  \ this new information, fed through the corner of my eye, slowly it was only at\
  \ the last moment I realized it was a cow! Running at me! On a random street in\
  \ a random city in India! \nThe next moment I felt the cow's horns hitting my left\
  \ side. It was an unstoppable force and I was nowhere near an immovable object.\
  \ My body flew over the pavement and I ended upside down on the ground. The cow\
  \ was not ready yet and started stomping on my chest. In a reflex I started kicking\
  \ the bovine deity in the gut until it started stumbling away. \nAs I lay there,\
  \ on the ground, beaten by a cow it took me a few moments to gasp for breath and\
  \ look up. Dozens of locals gathered around the cow, trying to assess if the animal\
  \ wasn't hurt. The only attention I got was a series of dirty looks and curses that\
  \ were directed to my person and probably involved something like a Hindu hell.\n\
  Back in my hotel room I found my chest and stomach bruised and a subsequent visit\
  \ the doctor told me about a broken rib. I never learned why the cow attacked me\
  \ or what I had done wrong, but three months later I flew to Johannesburg, South\
  \ Africa, and the first meal was a beef burger. Vengeance, as I found, is a dish\
  \ best served with ketchup."
