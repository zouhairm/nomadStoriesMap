Text: "I was looking forward to a quiet night reminiscing with my friend about our\
  \ school years over a glass of cheap wine. With a familiar person in a quiet place,\
  \ the hummingbird that had been fluttering in my chest all day was finally settling\
  \ down. \n\nA faded pastel hammock hung in the window of her rented apartment in\
  \ the heart of Barranquilla, Colombia. She and her boyfriend\u2014a Barranquilla\
  \ local with immaculately groomed facial hair\u2014both lounged in it, rocking gently.\
  \ They were murmuring to one another in Spanish when he suddenly turned to me and\
  \ said in English, \u201CWe have to take you to La Troja!\u201D\n\nLa Troja, I learned,\
  \ wasn\u2019t just a bar\u2014it was a Barranquilla institution. I was in Colombia\
  \ for only a week, and in Barranquilla just this one night; I didn\u2019t want to\
  \ miss anything. I made a quick wardrobe change and we headed out the door. The\
  \ hummingbird flapped its wings in protest. \n\nThe piano and trumpet of a salsa\
  \ song mingled with the hum of a crowd as we walked the last block to our destination.\
  \ A brick patio stretched along both sides of the corner bar, dotted with round,\
  \ yellow tables. Most of the colourful plastic chairs were occupied and unlike the\
  \ dimly lit Western bars and clubs I was used to, the entire place was brilliant\
  \ with white light.\n\nDrinking the same light beer as everyone else I swayed to\
  \ the music self-consciously in my seat. There was no dancefloor; couples and the\
  \ occasional single danced in whatever space they could find between tables, moving\
  \ their feet and hips effortlessly to the music, smiling, laughing, and shouting\
  \ to friends across the patio.\n\nHow were these people so profoundly comfortable\
  \ with themselves? The beer probably helped, but they seemed to have a joie de vivre\
  \ unhampered by relentless anxieties and meaningless stress\u2014something I craved\
  \ but didn\u2019t know how to achieve.\n\nAdmiration and envy competed for top sentiment\
  \ in my mind as our trio talked and laughed and I watched the people around me.\
  \ Their self-assurance and cheer were catching.\n\nI tried, mostly in vain, to understand\
  \ bits and pieces of Spanish, and every so often a warm breeze reached me from the\
  \ street.\n\nAnd gradually, the beat of the hummingbird\u2019s wings faded into\
  \ the background."
