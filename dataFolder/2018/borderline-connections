Text: "It was almost Christmas, and people were rushing into malls, chasing the perfect\
  \ present for the beloved ones and the last minute (preferably inexpensive) one,\
  \ for all the others they have to deal with every day.\nThere I was, trying to promote\
  \ those fancy and exciting \u201Cexperience gift boxes\u201D for lazy people, and\
  \ observing those human beings moving unceasingly from one store to the other. I\
  \ used to do this kind of job during my university years, and it always felt a bit\
  \ curious to see how making a present could turn into such a stressful and unpleasant\
  \ activity.  Everyone seemed to be inside his own bubble, without really entering\
  \ the world. It felt sad and a little disturbing to think about how inward we can\
  \ be, even while doing something that should all be about showing care for others.\n\
  Suddenly my colleague, a psychology student, turned to me and said: -You know, I\
  \ read that hitchhiking is somehow considered therapeutic. You feel free to talk\
  \ about yourself to a person you are most likely about to never meet again. Let\u2019\
  s say it\u2019s a one-shot session.\nShe smiled at me. We used to talk, during those\
  \ boring noons, about how travel enthusiast I was, and she knew that, since money\
  \ wasn\u2019t that much back then, I would just stick my thumb out, on the road.\n\
  So I thought back over my hitchhiking across Europe. About Edin, from Bosnia, married\
  \ with a Swedish woman. He escaped the war in his home country, where all his male\
  \ relatives died, and is now happy with his wife and his two kids. He drove me with\
  \ his truck from Germany to Denmark, were he had to load the trailer with beers\
  \ produced over there. Then I met Frank, with his special van. He could not walk,\
  \ but he drove me to Copenhagen, and called his wife to tell her that he was having\
  \ a guest. I still have the candy box he gave me. I gave him a chocolate bar back.\
  \ I asked if his wife was waiting for him, and he candidly replied: -Always.\nHere\
  \ is where the bubble bursts. Where you can meet people in their most genuine selves,\
  \ and you can really feel the contact with their lives, even if only for a few minutes\
  \ or hours. \nThat\u2019s how I met Tapani, Johan, Jimi, Katty, and many others,\
  \ I heard about their stories and their everyday life. We shared chocolate, candies\
  \ and coffee while chewing up the miles. \nI could tell many stories about human\
  \ encounters, I traveled a lot and in many different ways, but this was the most\
  \ delicate one to step into someone\u2019s life for a little, and it always left\
  \ a sense of peace of mind."
