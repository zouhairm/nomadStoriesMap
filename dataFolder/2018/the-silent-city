Text: "News broke of Bal Thackeray\u2019s death on the overnight train from Delhi\
  \ to Mumbai. Hungry for information, appetite for the morning newspapers was greater\
  \ than that for the breakfast dahl, and frantic rumours of strike action and political\
  \ unrest circulated round the carriages. \n\nHaving gladly shed the weight of our\
  \ backpacks we walked quickly through the subdued streets, feeling ill at ease in\
  \ the eerie stillness. \"City tour?\" I swung around, heart pounding, trying to\
  \ locate the owner of the male voice. Al stepped into view. \"I thought no one could\
  \ drive in the city today?\" I said, voicing just one of the concerns racing round\
  \ my mind. \"I'm Muslim,\" he replied simply. \u201COnly Hindu people care about\
  \ strike.\u201D\n\nAgainst our better judgement, we ignored earlier warnings of\
  \ vehicle stonings and found ourselves in a taxi being chauffeured around the deserted\
  \ streets of India\u2019s most populated city. At the final stop, we followed Al\
  \ down a narrow passageway, stepping over bird defecation, our feet crunching on\
  \ broken glass, until we arrived at a darkened entrance.\n\nAl\u2019s home: with\
  \ just three people inside, there was barely room to move. Despite having very little,\
  \ Al thrust a beer into our hands. He sat down on the hard floor and took a long\
  \ sip from his bottle, resting his head against the wall behind him. When he spoke\
  \ again, his voice cracked with emotion. \u201CHe killed my father.\u201D\n\nJanuary\
  \ 1993. Religious tensions between the Hindu population and the Muslim minority\
  \ had long been an issue in India. Gangs acting on behalf of Bal Thackaray\u2019\
  s Shiv Sena violently charged the homes of Muslim people, torching businesses and\
  \ looting property. To keep his family safe, Al\u2019s father had entered into an\
  \ altercation with a gang member. He was doused in petrol and set alight, engulfed\
  \ in magnificent orange flames that licked at his ankles and weaved through his\
  \ hair. Ten-year-old Al watched, helpless, as the fire ate his father alive. \n\n\
  \u201CI cannot respect this day\u2026.or that man!\u201D Al said, his voice thick\
  \ with grief. \u201CHe may have silenced this city, but he will not silence me.\
  \ Not today. Not ever. I work hard to make my father proud!\u201D\n\nBack in the\
  \ comfort of the hotel room, my eyes rested upon my backpack that, only hours before,\
  \ I had slung from my aching shoulders into the corner of the room. I had more in\
  \ those 70 litres than Al had in his entire home. I sighed, my mind exhausted. I\
  \ could only hope that my heart held a millilitre of the kindness and resolve that\
  \ Al held in his."
