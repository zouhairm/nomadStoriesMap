Text: "\u201CPryvit!\u201D \n\nI had no idea what they were saying, but I assumed\
  \ it was \u201Chello\u201D since these two Ukrainian women were waving enthusiastically\
  \ to me. It turned out to be a pretty good guess. \n\nI had just arrived in my training\
  \ community of Borova, about one hour away from the Ukrainian capital of Kiev. I\
  \ was to spend the first three months of my 27-month commitment to the Peace Corps\
  \ in this small village, trying to learn the local language, cultural norms, and\
  \ educational techniques necessary for success as a TEFL instructor. These skills,\
  \ along with some perseverance, open-mindedness, and luck, were to help me navigate\
  \ the precarious waters of life in a developing nation.\n\nWhat was I doing here?\
  \ I had just left everything behind when I decided to make the leap to Eastern Europe.\
  \ Back in New York were my close friends, a comfortable job in major-donor stewardship,\
  \ my favorite bookstores and cafes\u2014essentially, my life. I had no Slavic language\
  \ experience, but I did have a desire to see the world and work in international\
  \ development.\n\nI arrived at what would serve as my home for three months, weighed\
  \ down by a hiking backpack and one large suitcase. My host family immediately began\
  \ pointing at various household items and enunciating Ukrainian words to help me\
  \ start picking up the language: carrot, table, salt, coffee. We sat down that night\
  \ to a pizza dinner together with the whole family: my host sister Marina, brothers\
  \ Anton and Ivan, my host mother Ira, and her aunt, also named Ira. Within three\
  \ months, and despite countless errors, I found myself speaking in full conversations\
  \ with my host family. I was invited to be the best man in Anton\u2019s wedding\
  \ and a groomsman in Ivan\u2019s wedding as well. My \u201Cgrandma\u201D Ira and\
  \ I shared countless meals together as she was regularly home alone during the day\
  \ and drank homemade vodka late into most evenings. \n\nI did not have the luck\
  \ to continue Peace Corps in Ukraine with political instability resulting in my\
  \ mandated evacuation in March 2014. I was happy to return to Ukraine in February\
  \ 2017 for the first time. Anton picked me up at the airport and we shared favorite\
  \ meals like borscht and cabbage rolls; Ira and I drank too much vodka again. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t until I learned Ukrainian that I understood that our first meal was\
  \ pizza because my host family thought I missed the United States and wanted to\
  \ offer me a reminder of home. I did not have the heart to tell them that we do\
  \ not put mayonnaise on pizza."
