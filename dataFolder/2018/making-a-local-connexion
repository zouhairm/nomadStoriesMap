Text: "I've seen his eyes for the first time. Just two eyes which beg humanity, violence\
  \ and sadness. He had difficulties to speak my language and i don't know a word\
  \ of his. \n\nI wanted to know about his story and how he comes this summer, may\
  \ be for his entire life...\n\nHe talks me about this strange travel. He was lucky\
  \ to have his parents to pay a lot. His brother was arrested in hungary duringthe\
  \ same travel. He knows how it isto sleep out, to be hungry, cold, rain, nasty people\
  \ and racism bit he's here now. \n\nI've eaten on his social flat, i've dreamed\
  \ with his stories and i cried. Now i left the city to go at university and he is\
  \ in my memories for all my life. I think about him when i m down to be more brave,\
  \ like him. I don't talk anyore with him because he can't read french but it's an\
  \ hero. He represents the suerman of my day. He's great and he lives as someone\
  \ who is 80 years old. A kind of god ! \n\nThat's the proof of humanity. Two people\
  \ whithout nothing in common, not the culture, not the food, not the religion, not\
  \ the language, nothing, can be friends and a great teacher of thelive to each one.\n\
  \nEverybody could have this story. You've just to etablish a fool connexion with\
  \ others. Another country, another people, another culture. I stayed in town but\
  \ he mooved to me. \n\nHe comes from afghanistan and he's called Anwarsaha"
