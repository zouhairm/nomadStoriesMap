Text: "It all began on a Thursday in November 1989 in Berlin. I was seven years old\
  \ when the wall came down in East Germany opening the iron gate to the west but\
  \ most importantly to the world. I\u2019m sitting on my dad\u2019s shoulders watching\
  \ people lifting each other over walls and barbwire pushing towards freedom. I remember\
  \ moments of that day as if it was yesterday, but I certainly didn\u2019t understand\
  \ the gravity of this historical day. Three decades later I can barely grasp the\
  \ impact this moment had on my life. \n\nI grew up in a system that didn\u2019t\
  \ really know where to go but we were finally free to go wherever we wanted to.\
  \ I decided to leave with nowhere to go but somewhere else. I choose wings over\
  \ roots, mountains over walls, a life on the road. I decided never to go back. Freedom\
  \ has been and always will be my most valuable possession while the rest of my life\
  \ fits into my backpack. Traveling the world reminds me more than anything of where\
  \ I\u2019m coming from and how lucky I am, but it also reminds me every day of something\
  \ that I\u2019ve lost a long time ago, and I\u2019m just starting to realise how\
  \ much I miss the feeling of calling a place home.\n\nThey should hand out warning\
  \ leaflets with your first passport. Every Paracetamol comes with an endless list\
  \ of risks and side-effects but as a traveller you are on your own. No one told\
  \ me that travel bug and wanderlust are a real thing. An Arabic proverb says the\
  \ soul travels at a camels\u2019 pace. There is a good chance that my camel lost\
  \ track over the past years. \n\nI\u2019ve got bitten by almost every crawling and\
  \ flying thing out there, prayed for salvation over the filthiest toilets on this\
  \ planet, spend the most terrifying hours of my life under Chinese arrest, and found\
  \ myself in more than one situation, where things could have gone terribly wrong.\
  \ \nThere were moments, where I would have sold my soul for a cheese cracker and\
  \ sometimes I miss my loved ones so much that it hurts. \nBut once in a blue moon\
  \ you\u2019ll find yourself in those fractures of time when your camel shows up\
  \ and everything makes sense. The first glimpse of Mount Everest, dancing the night\
  \ away in Rio de Janeiro, the smell of raspberries under the milky way, a phallus-blessing\
  \ in Bhutan, entering the green room in Hawaii or a little Tibetan boy, who can\u2019\
  t stop touching my \u2018golden` hair.       \n\nThis is my story and I would write\
  \ it over and over again."
