Text: "I had anticipated that the most difficult part of my excursion was going to\
  \ be ascending the plank road in the sky, a terrifying narrow wooden plank path\
  \ suspended on the side of a mountain with a death defying drop. This, however,\
  \ was only part of my perilous journey at Mount Hua. The plank road in the sky was\
  \ a truly sensational experience. Lingering several thousand feet over a precipitous\
  \ drop off the side of the mountain I clung to the cliff edge as I tip toed across\
  \ the rickety, old, weathered planks of wood. However, the real adventure was trying\
  \ to get home. After conquering the death-defying wooden planks I felt heroic but\
  \ my enthusiasm quickly faded as I realised I would have to race down the mountain\
  \ in order to catch the last train. Frantically clambering down slopes, stairs and\
  \ jagged pathways to reach the crammed cable cars, I was against the clock. The\
  \ cable car rocked vigorously as it soared down the side of the mountain. Descending\
  \ further in the dark a coach wove itself down ropey, twirling roads before abruptly\
  \ stopping at the edge of a dimly lit path; I feared I was lost. I continued my\
  \ journey on foot. In the pitch black, half jogging, I ran down an anonymous path\
  \ and hailed the only taxi. There was already a passenger, a small elderly woman,\
  \ but neither seemed to mind an extra customer, so I hopped in. I told him in broken\
  \ Chinese that I had to make it to the train station to catch the last train. He\
  \ sped off, whizzing through the traffic before stopping suddenly for the elderly\
  \ lady to get slowly out of the car. Before she had even shut the door properly\
  \ he swiftly departed, hurtling through the traffic until he unexpectedly turned\
  \ off the main road onto a dirt path. There was no one around, no lights and no\
  \ buildings. Was this a quick detour or was it in fact the end. Thankfully, hurtling\
  \ over the bumps in the path, I saw a light shining in the distance, the train station.\
  \ I checked my watch, I barely had three minutes to dash through the station, get\
  \ through security and board the train. The taxi tyres screeched as he pulled up\
  \ to the station and I sprinted up the long path to the train. Wheezing I handed\
  \ over my train tickets. Pointing furiously towards security I dashed through as\
  \ hurried torches flashed at me and my bag. Without stopping I scaled the steps\
  \ and dived onto the train just as the doors shut and the train immediately departed.\
  \ I felt like Indiana Jones and punched my fists in the air excitedly shouting \u201C\
  \ I made it!\u201D."
