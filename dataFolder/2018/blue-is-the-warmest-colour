Text: "The Matterhorn: a mountain that has inspired an attraction at Disneyland, a\
  \ chocolate bar (Toblerone), and I\u2019m pretty sure Dr Seuss\u2019 Mt Crumpit.\
  \ Located at the border of Italy and Switzerland, it once inspired a race to the\
  \ summit between the two sides. For most travelers, such a mountain climb is not\
  \ in the cards, but seeing the Matterhorn should be priority for any visitor to\
  \ the region.\n\nGornergrat offers some of the best views of the Matterhorn but\
  \ also offers the opportunity for a unique tobogganing experience. On that mountain,\
  \ they have a 10-minute run that provides stunning views of the Matterhorn and thrilling\
  \ turns. I had to do it. \n\nI only made it halfway before I picked up too much\
  \ speed and couldn\u2019t make a tight turn, causing me to crash through a fence.\
  \ \n\nI shook it off and used the sled as a walker to get down the hill, watching\
  \ lots of people successfully manage the course. I thought I was just banged up\
  \ and a little shaken but otherwise okay. However, the next morning I woke to discover\
  \ how wrong I was.\n\nI spent my 27th birthday in a Swiss hospital. My foot had\
  \ swollen up and I couldn\u2019t walk on it or even put on my boots. My gifts would\
  \ be a pair of blue crutches and a crushed spirit.\n\nThe next morning, I decided\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t let this setback keep me from enjoying my trip. It was then, while\
  \ walking around Lucerne, that I discovered I had joined a Not-So-Secret Society.\
  \ A man on the opposite street corner called out and waved a matching set of blue\
  \ crutches. I returned his gesture. This happened for the rest of my time in Switzerland;\
  \ commiseration and camaraderie amongst strangers.\n\nSwitzerland wasn\u2019t my\
  \ last stop, and as a budget traveler, I had planned to take my next flight with\
  \ just carry-on. Unfortunately, that plan was made when I could wear my boots. I\
  \ had another choice to make: check a bag or ditch my boots. Hint: I\u2019m wearing\
  \ those boots right now. \n\nWith a checked bag, I now had carry-on space, so I\
  \ decided to make the most of it. I took the opportunity to load my bag with chocolate\
  \ to share with family and friends upon my return. The chocolate made up for the\
  \ fact that, due to the lost day, I never made it to a Swiss chocolate factory.\n\
  \nDid the crutches make things harder? Yes. But the great thing about traveling\
  \ is everywhere you go, there\u2019s something new. So, while some things might\
  \ no longer be accessible, there are plenty of alternative experiences around any\
  \ given corner. Also chocolate\u2014chocolate makes everything better."
