Text: "I squatted in an unnamed village on the banks of the Volta River, completely\
  \ naked and highly aware of the two women peeking over my makeshift shower of sticks\
  \ and a bucket. Only their eyes were visible as they watched me undress. While I\
  \ poured handfuls of water over my head, my host mother and sister\u2019s heads\
  \ inched their way over the barrier until their necks were brazenly draped over\
  \ my pointless attempt at privacy.\n\nThere are two strangers watching me shower,\
  \ I thought. Ok, technically I\u2019ve known them for 10 hours. But still\u2026\
  \ I make my sister turn around when we\u2019re changing in the same room, and I\u2019\
  ve known her my whole life! I considered shooing them, but worried I might come\
  \ off as rude. So... what? I just keep showering? My fear of offending them trumped\
  \ my modesty; I looked up at my spectators.\n\nWe made eye contact and a field of\
  \ goosebumps bloomed across my arms. My sister let out a nervous giggle and my mother\u2019\
  s eyes doubled in size. I smiled, which they translated as an invitation to touch\
  \ my bumpy forearm. In return, my sister held out her own and I felt her dry, dirt-coated\
  \ skin.\n\nShe howled with laughter, drawing the attention of a nearby group of\
  \ children. She rushed between them and the open side of the shower while my mother\
  \ chased the children away. It was then I realized, to them, this was an unnaturally\
  \ private shower. Among themselves they bathed communally in the river, but today\
  \ they had constructed a shelter and acted as my sentinels.\n\nI reached for my\
  \ towel and began to pat myself dry; they watched in silent fascination. Moved by\
  \ their guardianship, I took a deep breath, abandoned whatever shame and humility\
  \ I had managed to hold onto, and gestured for them to come closer. Smiles sprouted\
  \ from their lips as they launched themselves forward and patted me all over with\
  \ what was clearly the first towel they had ever seen. Each patch of dry skin ignited\
  \ a fresh set of giggles, and soon I was laughing too, trying to dress while they\
  \ still wanted to experiment with the towel.\n\nA few days later, it was time to\
  \ say goodbye. I gifted my towel to my mother and sister, both of whom clung to\
  \ it with one hand while hugging me with the other. I turned to leave, but my mother\
  \ grabbed my bicep. She took the kente scarf, traditionally gifted to Ghanaians\
  \ by their family for momentous occasions, from her neck and draped it over mine.\
  \ I looked in her eyes, Thank you. She nodded and said one final word in place of\
  \ goodbye.\n\nFamily."
