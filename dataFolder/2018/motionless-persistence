Text: "Light blinds me through my closed lids. I open them. Two blasting halogen bulbs\
  \ burn from 30 feet above our hard, plywood bunks. My five cellmates dream on in\
  \ various positions of sleeplessness. The cell has no clock, thus time is also absent.\n\
  \nThey already know everything now. They have everything they want. They can see\
  \ I'm just a kid. They must know I wasn't committing any crimes. They must know\
  \ I wasn't laundering money. \n\nThe boss of my school had asked me to do one simple\
  \ thing. Lie.\n\nThe siren blasts to life, interrupting my train of thought. The\
  \ speaker is obviously blown out as it rattles and flaps. Time for my morning walk,\
  \ making my own rounds within the cell. My cellmates, miraculously, continue their\
  \ slumber through all the noise.\n\nIt's day 15 now. I've just completed my 3rd\
  \ \u6B63 on the wall. This \u6B63 (pronounced \"Jeng\") is the Chinese way of keeping\
  \ track of days in jail. If you look closely, it has 5 lines, the same amount as\
  \ Western tally marks. Its meaning in Chinese is \"right now\". The plaster walls\
  \ are littered with these marks.\n\nThis first week in jail had been a mix of novelty\
  \ and nightmare. In that dark, putrid, stinking cell I had struggled in my mind\
  \ to break free. I made all kinds of wild assumptions. \n\nI am a walker. When problems\
  \ arise, I use the power of my stubbornness to solve issues. My mother always strapped\
  \ a helmet on and head bashed problems when anything stood in her way. From my childhood\
  \ rearing, the motto \"Persistence means to keep moving\" came to fruition as my\
  \ mantra.\n\nBut when all your power is stripped away, and you sit in a concrete\
  \ room, surrounded by an incomprehensible dialect, that mode of thinking just won't\
  \ do. You are trapped in your mind, and something else must give to preserve your\
  \ sanity. Something else has to come in to play. Resisting and fighting back will\
  \ only serve to hurt you further. Life is full of these unexpected times where moving\
  \ will do absolutely nothing to help the situation.\n\nA new motto began to take\
  \ form. Situations such as these must be accounted for in everyone's life, regardless\
  \ of the person or the circumstance. The term \"resilience\" comes to mind. Being\
  \ able to recover and adapt to difficult situations is the very core of what makes\
  \ us human. Oftentimes, in a world filled with convenience, we seldom have the opportunity\
  \ to flex this mental muscle. But this is the foundation of our species. \n\nSometimes\
  \ persistence means to keep moving.\nSometimes persistence means to stop moving."
