Text: "It was a nice Sunday morning in Kanpur, Uttar Pradesh (A city in Northern India\
  \ about 500 km away from capital Delhi). I was with one of my office colleague Abhishek\
  \ on an audit trip in Kanpur, decided to enjoy the Sunday & explore things around.\
  \ \nWe ended our search on \u201CBrahmvart Ghat\u201D which was in \u201Cbithoor\u201D\
  \ about 23 km in north of Kanpur City. After about an hour we were on the main road\
  \ from where we have to start walking. The road sign showed destination was 150meters\
  \ from the main road. It was a narrow but busy street houses on both sides & the\
  \ sun couldn\u2019t reach the surface.\nOn the way out of ghat, Abhishek touched\
  \ nearly every step by both hands (He was displaying his devotedness). A short distance\
  \ from there I saw a broken mosque, which seemed to be left deserted. I always find\
  \ these types of structures intriguing because of their history. So I went there\
  \ & asked Abhishek to join. He replied it\u2019s a mosque, I can\u2019t go up there.\
  \ I didn\u2019t found this behavior of him any different because we are the people\
  \ living in a divided & diversified society at the same time.  \nOnce I reached\
  \ there I found, it was in so damaged. The walls were broken, half roof left & the\
  \ other half was covered by blue plastic sheet, plaster on the rest of walls were\
  \ out from which bricks were visible. It was like Lighting had struck here pretty\
  \ bad. \nI saw a lady climbing stairs, touching every step and with both hands like\
  \ Abhishek did on Ghat. She seemed local to me just then I couldn\u2019t help myself\
  \ noticing bangles in her hand. I haven\u2019t seen before any Muslim doing such\
  \ or having such attire. I couldn\u2019t resist myself for going up there. I saw\
  \ a man giving tribute of a green Sheet over already covered space. I noticed that\
  \ Iron Gate behind which the Holy Quran was placed was closed. I went there& asked\
  \ why it is close? He said Kasid (Qaaji) is not here, he went to Delhi to his sister\u2019\
  s last Monday. I asked who you are. He said his name is Ajay Mishra & Kasid is our\
  \ neighbor he asked me to do the rituals once a day. I asked the man about the condition\
  \ of mosque. The man replied that It is used as a local religious school for the\
  \ local children here. He said me n my wife tries to give them knowledge about Hindu\
  \ culture too.\nOn one side it was Abhishek, who was well educated but had limited\
  \ his thoughts to his own religion that he couldn\u2019t climb the stairs to a mosque\
  \ & there was Ajay, who was not in good condition but still exploring & spreading\
  \ the beauty of other religions."
