Text: "\u201CWho has never done the hula hoop?\u201D\nIn the square a few shy hands\
  \ rose up, including mine. Suddenly the fluo-dressed girl who had spoken was approaching\
  \ me.\n\u201CNo, no, wait! I just arrived!\u201D I said pointing at my new pink\
  \ trolley. She smiled and said:\L \u201CWelcome to Edinburgh! Now come with me\u201D\
  .\nThe curiosity, and my desire to throw myself headlong into new adventures, led\
  \ me, less than an hour after my landing, into doing (trying) the hula hoop in a\
  \ square in front of hundreds of strangers laughing. The hilarity of my poor performance\
  \ turned into amazement in the eyes of people while these two extraordinary artists,\
  \ arrived from Australia especially for the Fringe Festival, performed in circus\
  \ numbers of any kind. In the amazement I began to hear the music of a bagpipe carried\
  \ by the wind and so, attracted by new sounds and smells, I found myself walking\
  \ down again on Princess Street. At one point i saw a sign that seemed like a miracle:\
  \ Free Hot Chocolate. I knew there was a trick, but this time I thought it was worth\
  \ the risk. As soon as I took the warm paper cup in my hand, I saw a middle-aged\
  \ gentleman smiling while approaching me:\n\u201CDo you believe in God?\u201D, he\
  \ asked.\L\n\u201CNo, I don\u2019t\u201D. He did not seem surprised, he looked at\
  \ me more like a challenge to take up. Despite my expectations, however, he did\
  \ not try to convince me of anything, he just wanted to talk. His intelligence was\
  \ gleaming through his bright eyes, this impressed me so I decided that if I made\
  \ a whole square laugh, then I could have talk to one person. \LWhen I finished\
  \ my paper cup, the conversation ended too and we agreed on one thing: goodness\
  \ exists in people regardless of their religious beliefs. He also gave me an autographed\
  \ gospel: wonderful! As I was going to the hotel, some boys out a pub invited me\
  \ to go in and attend a free show in a room behind the pub, typical during Fringe.\
  \ The place was psychedelic: the walls covered with murals, lights that changed\
  \ color and full of people with dubious lucidity. I entered the room in the corridor:\
  \ it was small, no windows, only one light on one side and a lots of chairs; when\
  \ it was full of people it turned out to be almost claustrophobic. The show began\
  \ when a girl closed the door, stood in front of everyone and, winking, announced:\
  \ \u201CLadies, gentlemen and scotsmen, tonight, only for you, free the nipples\
  \ show!\u201D. Then she got fully undressed. While I was getting comfortable on\
  \ the chair I thought: \L\u201CWelcome to Edinburgh indeed\u201D."
