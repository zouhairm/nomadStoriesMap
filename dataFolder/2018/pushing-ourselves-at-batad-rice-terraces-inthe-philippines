Text: "This morning our driver arrived at 8.30 am and took us to a Banaue caf\xE9\
  \ for breakfast. Our guide then joined us for our days tour of the famous Batad\
  \ Rice Terraces.\nThe winding road to the start of the walk down to the ancient\
  \ terraces was badly affected by recent landslips. Some had rocks on the road as\
  \ big as our van. Others merely blocked most of the road with rocks and mud. The\
  \ drop off beside the road was precipitous and passing other vehicles very dangerous.\
  \ We crossed a clouded in mountain pass at 1400 metres before descending to the\
  \ Terrace entrance. The terraces are at 1100 metres.  Arriving at the drop off point\
  \ we started downwards on a steep muddy and rocky trail made extremely hazardous\
  \ by the overnight rain. \nWilson, our guide, held Erica\u2019s hand most of the\
  \ way as her open sandals had no grip. Several near falls were avoided. Reaching\
  \ the viewpoint overlooking these 1000 year old terraces we could not believe what\
  \ we saw. The terraces rice up the steep mountainside like giant steps and are UNESCO\
  \ listed. A breathtaking sight and up there with the best in the world!\nWilson\
  \ explained we were to walk across the middle of the terraces on the banks and then\
  \ climb up to a small village. We were then to climb down via a series of steps\
  \ to the village in the terraces before climbing up to our starting point. \nWe\
  \ set off on what was to be the most challenging and dangerous trek we have ever\
  \ taken! Hired a long stick each for support and headed off with Wilson leading.\
  \ The tops of the rock terrace walls were both narrow and slippery with a muddy\
  \ terrace on one side and about a 3 metre drop off on the other side to the terrace\
  \ below. As we descended between terraces we were forced to climb backwards down\
  \ a series of flattish rocks inserted into the terrace walls. A very hazardous exercise\
  \ to say the least. At one point at the bottom of one set of these primitive steps\
  \ was an ancient wooden ladder. The danger was lurking every where as our aging\
  \ bodies started to complain as we tried to avoid falling in this isolated place\
  \ where the only way out for the injured or ill is to be carried by strong men in\
  \ a blanket style stretcher hung from a long stick!\nWe were both thinking that\
  \ a fall on to the rocks lining the deep water channels was just a matter of time.\
  \ Our photos will tell the story better than I but enough to say it was the experience\
  \ of a lifetime."
