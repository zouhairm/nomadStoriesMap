Text: "Imagine it is summer time and you have been working for a full year without\
  \ any breaks. Meanwhile you look on Instagram and people are sipping on cocktails\
  \ on beaches of Croatia, or enjoying a wonderful view of the Andes in Peru and other\
  \ pictures yelling \u201Cpack your bags and get the hell out\u201D. So that\u2019\
  s exactly what I did.  Georgia had been on my bucket list so I called up my cousin\
  \ and without second thoughts he agreed to join us with his wife.\nGeorgia is a\
  \ tricky place cause it shares its name with the American state of Georgia and if\
  \ you are not alert you might end up looking for the Coca Cola museum on the streets\
  \ of Tbilisi! \nI often daydreamed about a picture I had seen of a beautiful Georgian\
  \ church perched on up of a rolling hill and always assumed that it should be impossible\
  \ to reach such a wonderful place. However, after a little bit of research online\
  \ and getting irrelevant pictures of churches near Atlanta Georgia, I finally found\
  \ the Gergeti trinity church overlooking a small town and facing the imposing Kazbegi\
  \ Mountain. As we started the ascent a stray dog ran towards & meanwhile I am about\
  \ to wet my pants because of my crazy phobia of dogs.\nMy phobia started building\
  \ up little by little from being chased by a dog in Bled, Slovenia, to being circled\
  \ by growling stray dogs in Malaysia.\nAnyway, I decided to man up and continue.\
  \ Once on top we could see the whole town and the amazing Kazbegi Mountain. The\
  \ view of the church was breathtaking and way beyond our expectations.\nAfter spending\
  \ a good part of the day up taking in the views and enjoying the great weather,\
  \ we decided to head back down. The track overlooked a beautiful river in the valley\
  \ below and even had remnants of a castle. Near the end of our descend I was faced\
  \ with a dog blocking the route that we had to take into the village. So I decided\
  \ to pass by feeling relaxed. As soon as I passed in front of the dog, he turned\
  \ around, immediately got up and approached me & pushed his teeth in my tasty leg.\
  \ It all happened too fast that I did not know what to do. I could hear my wife\
  \ shouting for help as I tried to kick the dog in the head with a few unsuccessful\
  \ kicks. Finally my cousin threw some rocks until it decided to let go. Then we\
  \ slowly backed down and walked away. My whole body was shaking and I knew the phobia\
  \ was going to get worse. This was really the last thing I expected. Luckily there\
  \ was a bar restaurant just beside where this happened & the kind owners treated\
  \ the wound."
