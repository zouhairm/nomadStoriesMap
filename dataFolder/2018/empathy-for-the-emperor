Text: "The Far East of the globe is a mesmerising place. It can take your breath away,\
  \ especially when travelling directly from the Western World. I had done exactly\
  \ this; from the unparalleled natural beauty of New Zealand, to the vast outback\
  \ of Australia, a short stop in paradise-twinned Fiji and then I landed in the martian\
  \ land of Japan. Sensational Japan. It was here that I learnt an entirely new culture,\
  \ massively different to any I'd previously witnessed, and it was here that I met\
  \ a lady that I find hard to forget.\n\nKaoru was the lady who ran Guest House Neko\
  \ Neko in Osaka. It was a traditional looking Japanese guest house that she owned\
  \ with her husband (Antoine). At first, Kaoru seemed to be the welcoming, hard-working\
  \ hostel owner that I'd come to see over and over again throughout my trip. She\
  \ was caring of her guests and helpful in a confusing city. Kaoru was the perfect\
  \ host, however after a couple of weeks it was clear that she was so much more than\
  \ just that.\n\nAfter a few mornings sharing the coffee pot with her and Antoine\
  \ I began to ask more layered questions than just your standard traveller small\
  \ talk. It was around then that Kaoru shone through as a wonderful human and a nomad's\
  \ inspiration. I found out that she had in fact travelled to 163 countries in just\
  \ forty years here on planet earth - 163! Of them all she mentioned that it was\
  \ in fact Syria that was her favourite; a sad revelation with all new things considered,\
  \ but when Kaoru was there it sounded marvellous. I was let into Kaoru's life a\
  \ little bit when she showed me her collection of trinkets from around the world,\
  \ I was inspired to start a collection of my own though I'm unsure they'll ever\
  \ amount to the wonders of Karou's treasure chest.\n\nWe became friends. We shared\
  \ dinners and stories. We even did the morning workout that played out through the\
  \ crackly old radio atop the busy kitchen counter, I've never before partaken in\
  \ an AM Broadcast workout but I can say with confidence that I thoroughly enjoyed\
  \ it. I learnt that the only thing Kaoru loved more than her travels (and Antoine\
  \ of course) was her lazy, stubborn cat called Emperor. \"Empe I love you\" she\
  \ would call out three or four times every morning, Emperor would idly lay and turn\
  \ his face away. \n\nI was sad to leave Osaka and Kaoru, but happy to have met such\
  \ a gem of a woman. We have spoken since and everywhere I travel to I try to send\
  \ her a gift, though I know ultimately that she would have already gotten better\
  \ herself."
