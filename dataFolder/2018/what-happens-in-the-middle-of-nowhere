Text: "We stepped down onto a windy tarmac, blistering ice particles whipping our\
  \ faces, despite the glow from the last minutes of sun. In the summer, it\u2019\
  s called the Midnight Sun. But in the winter, there are only a few hours of daylight\
  \ and only negative temperatures.\n\nStill basking in the glow of an early dusk,\
  \ with the trepidation of children boarding a locomotive to Hogwarts, we climbed\
  \ aboard our rickety train headed to Abisko, the northern most point of Sweden.\
  \  \n\nAs we drifted through hills and plains of white snow, I thought, this must\
  \ be it: this must be what people mean by \u201Cthe middle of nowhere.\u201D If\
  \ we ever run out of food, there are no grocery stores in the Arctic circle. \n\n\
  Alone with nothing but our heavily-stocked backpacks, we trekked through fields\
  \ of snow and set up camp. That night, we waited, but saw nothing. The next night,\
  \ the skies were too cloudy. On the third night, we were desperately hallucinating\
  \ blurs of green, left and right. On the fourth night, it started to snow.\n\nWith\
  \ the equipment wet, food sparse, and their excitement fading fast, the team decided\
  \ it was time to pack up and go home. But as everyone slept, I sneaked out. If there\
  \ was even the slightest chance, I couldn't miss it. I grabbed my camera, a flashlight,\
  \ and my phone. Just in case...\n\nFrom a distance, all I could make out was the\
  \ faint glow of the closest town, miles away in Norway, and all I could hear were\
  \ my heavy, fur-lined boots crunching in the snow.  I found a bare tree and sat\
  \ beneath it, shaking in my snow suit. For hours, it was absolute silence. \n\n\
  After a while, my heart rate started to spike, as reason set in - What if the flashlight\
  \ died? What if I froze to death? What if my phone ran out of battery and I couldn\u2019\
  t find my way back??  I checked my phone: 3 A.M. This is silly, I should just go\
  \ back. \n\nAs I got up to turn and head back, I gasped. They had suddenly crept\
  \ up on me. Or maybe they had been there the whole time, and I had just been facing\
  \ the wrong direction.\n\nHues of electric green, bright pink, and soft purple were\
  \ curling and swirling in the dark. As if a wizard\u2019s wand had struck the sky,\
  \ a shooting star fell towards me and exploded into flames as it entered the atmosphere.\n\
  \nIn those fleeting seconds, I stopped thinking. I stopped snapping photos. I was\
  \ alone in the wild, and one with the world. \n\nThis is it: this must be what people\
  \ mean by \u201Cin the middle of nowhere.\u201D A place in time, a moment of magic\
  \ that will selfishly, forever be mine."
