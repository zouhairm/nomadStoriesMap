Text: "Standing on the rooftop of my hostel in Seville, I gazed at the Cathedral\u2019\
  s intricate towers and arches glowing against the night sky. Behind me, I could\
  \ hear numerous conversations between guests from all over the world. I took a deep\
  \ breath and turned around.\n\nGoing to parties. Ordering food. Making a phone call.\
  \ These interactions cause me social anxiety so I knew making friends in a place\
  \ where I knew no one was going to be difficult, but I had made the decision to\
  \ travel alone to do just that. To prevent the potential of second-guessing myself,\
  \ I rushed up to a girl standing across from me.\n\n\u201CHi, I\u2019m Sharvani.\u201D\
  \n\nAnd with that, the conversation flowed. \u201CWhere are you from? How long are\
  \ you in Spain for?\u201D She introduced me to two other solo travelers, and we\
  \ decided to get dinner together.\n\nAs we walked through the narrow cobblestone\
  \ streets, traditional buildings with mosaic-tiled entrances, latticed windows,\
  \ and balconies bursting with flowers were on either side of us. The sounds of people\
  \ clinking glasses, exclaiming, \u201CSalud!\u201D surrounded us. At the restaurant,\
  \ we ordered a number of tapas, working our way through diverse flavors from the\
  \ creaminess of the jamon y queso croquetas, the acidity of the boquerones, and\
  \ the heartiness of the carrillada de cerdo. Loosened by the beautiful surroundings,\
  \ lively atmosphere, and good food, I could slowly feel my previous fears of judgement\
  \ slip away and give way to natural conversation that I, for once, was not overthinking.\
  \ The four of us had a lot in common and had hit it off, bonding over our previous\
  \ adventures and our lives back home.\n\nUpon leaving the restaurant, we wandered\
  \ from wine bar to wine bar, passing the fort walls of the Alcazar and Parasol Metropol,\
  \ a modern white umbrella structure contrasting against much older surroundings.\
  \ We settled down in Plaza de Triunfo, gazing at the Cathedral in its entirety,\
  \ with its elaborately carved doors and lofty bell tower radiating gold. At 4AM,\
  \ the streets were empty, except for the four of us taking in the moment together.\n\
  \nWhen we reached the hostel, we made lunch plans for the day and head to our rooms.\
  \ As I got into bed, I realized that, regardless of any initial anxiety I might\
  \ feel, I was going to try to have similarly wonderful nights for the rest of my\
  \ time in Spain. As I fell asleep, I did not realize that I would achieve exactly\
  \ that by traveling with the people I just met for the next six days and befriending\
  \ more people every day with increasing ease."
