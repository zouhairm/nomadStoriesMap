Text: "\u201CDo you have any water? I'm thirsty.\u201D\nI sighed and looked at my\
  \ own half-empty bottle, passing it to my sister.\n\u201CNot much. It\u2019s scorching,\
  \ I feel like pouring it over myself. Ok, break's over, let's get moving.\u201D\n\
  Groaning we rose and started to push our bikes up the steepest mountain I'd ever\
  \ seen. It was a hot, clear day in Samoa and we were on a trip along Upolu island's\
  \ coast to see the giant clams. Snorkels in hand and grins ear to ear, the 40 km\
  \ ride through lush local flora and Samoan villages was pure wonder. But soon I\
  \ started to feel weary and the sweltering sun did no favors too. But that was only\
  \ the beginning of our struggles.  \n\nWe kept pushing, stopping every 10 steps\
  \ to catch a breath. I was exhausted. There were no people around, no phone service.\
  \ We'd been going up this wall for a while now, the road meandering in front of\
  \ us, never showing that elusive peak. \nSuddenly my sister dropped her bike and\
  \ collapsed. I rushed over, pouring the last of my water on her head.\n\u201CI can\u2019\
  t go any farther. I need a shade and some rest, it\u2019s too hard to move.\u201D\
  \  She looked ready to melt in the lush grass and my heart clenched. We were in\
  \ the middle of the Pacific Ocean, out of strength and water. But we also were on\
  \ an island paradise, ocean wind blowing around us, a moment of pure magic. I felt\
  \ inspired. So I said: \"Look, I know it\u2019s hard. Your legs gave out, your mouth\
  \ is dry and you think you won't make it. But brave that mountain with me, I promise\
  \ it'll be ok.\u201D\nPanting, we resumed our pilgrimage. It wasn\u2019t easy, but\
  \ soon we reached the top. I've never felt more alive than at that moment. Looking\
  \ across the jungle and into the ocean, my strength slowly returned. And then it\
  \ dawned on me. You can\u2019t always change what you experience, but you can choose\
  \ to either fear or to love it. Happiness is a choice.\nWe stopped at the foot of\
  \ the mountain to get some water from the Liua Le Vai O Sina river, reaching the\
  \ Giant Clams in no time after that. Entrance fee was 10 tala, paid to a local lady\
  \ living next to the beach. We got changed quickly, ready to jump in the sky blue\
  \ ocean to explore. My sister rushed in with reckless abandon, pulling me along.\
  \ As we swam in the deep water among the gleaming clams she said: \u201DYou know\
  \ I've always been afraid of water, but right now I'm not. I felt like that mountain\
  \ might be the end of me. But if I don't make it back, at least the last thing I\
  \ did was what I loved.\u201D I splashed some saltwater her way. \u201CMe too, dear,\
  \ me too.\u201D"
