Text: "I set up my tent in a field packed with steady soundtracks of crickets. \n\
  And as the beat went on, a pair of flashlights twinkled; I turned my head and saw\
  \ a truck move towards me. My reflexes told me to freeze; a paralysis induced on\
  \ occasion, possibly from living for too long in the city. The engine creaked and\
  \ a head popped out the window. A voice softly said, \u201CDo you need help?\u201D\
  . \n\u201CI\u2019m alright thank you, just enjoying the abundance of nature\u201D\
  . My smile stretched; The man nodded, pulled out and raised a hand to say goodbye.\
  \ Funny how estranged city dwellers become from the kindness of strangers. \n\n\
  I loosened up and sipped some air, then settled in my temporary home. Sleep came\
  \ and then dawn rose. I placed my feet out of the tent and dug my hands on wet strands\
  \ of grass; remnants from nature\u2019s morning bath - time to go. \n\nAt the village\
  \ center I saw a tall, slim figure from a far: Mr Haralambos Mavrellis. He was immersed\
  \ in a phone conversation. \u201CMiss, I don\u2019t even know how to use my nokia,\
  \ and you\u2019re asking me to lead a virtual museum tour? It can\u2019t be done,\
  \ I\u2019m sorry.\u201D He gently smiled, put the phone down and pressed a button\
  \ twice. He then looked up with raised eyebrows and a pair of marble eyes. \n\n\
  Mr Mavrellis is 83 and is a former teacher. His wife, Mrs Theano Mavrelli is a master\
  \ weaver of the \u2018phythkiotiko\u2019 endangered craft. The couple voluntarily\
  \ run the village\u2019s weaving museum. Mrs Mavrelli spends her days weaving meticulously\
  \ on a loom, whilst Mr Mavrellis gives articulate museum tours. \n\nToday, they\
  \ have taken the time to see me. They show me nature inspired textiles that are\
  \ embellished with 120 year old robocop looking figures. We walk through the laborious\
  \ production of silk thread and I receive a tribute to vernacular material culture.\
  \ They carry themselves in humble ways and I soon come to an understanding that\
  \ their habits are triggered by an innate affection for heritage. \n\nAnd whilst\
  \ I think these thoughts, I notice a mold and leak on the ceiling falling firmly\
  \ on a museum exhibit. It is loud enough to silence us, yet there are undertones\
  \ of screechy lamentations. I ask if they have any state support to run the museum.\
  \ Mr Mavrellis tells me that beyond congratulatory pats on the back, they have nothing.\
  \ \u201CNo one really cares about this place. But we have made a decision. Before\
  \ my wife dies, she will withdraw the exhibits and restore them safely back at home.\
  \ They do not deserve to rot.\u201D\n\nA tear trickles down his cheek. We sit down\
  \ and talk."
