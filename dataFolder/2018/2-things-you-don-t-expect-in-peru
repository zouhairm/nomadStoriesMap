Text: "Imagine this: you're a Spanish conquistador living in Barcelona during the\
  \ early 1500's. Candle wax costs more than oil. You crave the taste of salt, but\
  \ you may never taste black pepper in your lifetime: it's too expensive. Coffee\
  \ will not reach Spain for another hundred years, but you will be one of the first\
  \ Europeans to eat chocolate, perhaps believing it possesses magical powers, which\
  \ as we now know, it does. You will sail away from the chaos of the Atlantic Ocean\
  \ and discover another seemingly calmer sea, and call it Pacifico.\n\nYour country\
  \ has been perfecting the art of war for centuries now, millennia actually; men\
  \ have always been men. Your body armor is made of artistically-crafted steel. Your\
  \ weapon is the original double-edged sword, hand forged of the finest Toledo steel,\
  \ which can shatter a helmet or, in just a few minutes, slaughter 19 Inca warriors\
  \ wielding Stone- and Bronze-Age weapons.\n\nYou gather a skein of desperate men\
  \ harboring few morals. You give them sleeping hammocks on your ship. You give them\
  \ sea biscuits to eat, grog to drink. You give them weapons as fine as yours and\
  \ offer them a portion of the plunder. Most of them are illiterate or the illegitimate\
  \ sons of noblemen with old money and untethered cod pieces. You are all the kind\
  \ of men who literally have nothing to lose and everything to gain. Your ship is\
  \ a large caravel with a single deck and three masts, perhaps 60 feet long, about\
  \ the size of a modern-day millionaire's yacht or Columbus' Santa Maria. Perhaps\
  \ you load horses, fine Andalusians and the more rugged Sorraias, onto your ship.\
  \ You stabilize them with quilted elk-skin slings for the voyage to God only knows\
  \ where. Then you set sail for a new world, nothing but avarice and blood in your\
  \ eye.\n\nYou run across some atavistic Incas; they tell stories of El Dorado and\
  \ a lost city of gold. You smile, unsheathe your weapons, and charge your Andalusian\
  \ mare into battle, raking her flanks with finely-crafted spurs appearing more like\
  \ ornate sculptures meant for a museum than military equestrian tack. You die\u2026\
  maybe by the lucky strike of a young Inca warrior's slingshot. You leave behind\
  \ the legacy of your spurs, proof of a life lived hard, yet well.\n\nFive-hundred\
  \ years later in a Cuzco antique shop, a solo traveler recognizes your spurs for\
  \ what they are and pays the inflated price without even bargaining, believing them\
  \ a piece of fine art, yet the very last thing he expected to bear in his backpack\
  \ along the Inca Trail."
