Text: "\u201CTell me about forest\u201D I would often tell my Grandma.\nGrowing up\
  \ in a city, I believed that forest is a phenomenon which exists only in stories\
  \ of my Grandma and in books. They were my first painted canvases of forest; green\
  \ and dark; beautiful and mysterious. Until...\n\nGetting a call from my friend,\
  \ I set out on a trip to Nashik. \nDetermined to pursue the shortest route, I chose\
  \ to travel Dang. As I went further onto the meandering road, villages gradually\
  \ hid behind bamboo and teak thicket and the concrete landscape now replaced by\
  \ green hills and valleys. An hour later, my bike stopped with a jerk. Having no\
  \ option, I began dragging my bike up the hill until I got exhausted and decided\
  \ to find a nice place to rest. The sun had slowly begun to set at horizon and the\
  \ sky changed from shades of orange to purple and to black. The valley below which\
  \ was once green slowly turned to nothing but silhouettes. \n\nThe silence of forest\
  \ was deafening and in this despair, I heard a fade distant sound of drums. From\
  \ afar as I traced the source of sound, I noticed a small light within the foliage\
  \ and followed the sound inside forest. A closer look revealed the cluster of bamboo\
  \ huts and a few strangely clothed people celebrating around the fire; it was something\
  \ akin to finding an oasis amidst the desert.\nAs I approached the gathering, I\
  \ was met with surprised looks. Seeing a stranger for them was as strange as seeing\
  \ a festival inside forest were to me. An old lady greeted and asked me to join\
  \ in their celebration. Apprehensive at first, I noticed people around me, dancing\
  \ in circles with their hands held behind, some older people engaged in talks and\
  \ children running around. It was mesmerizing. The old lady then announced dinner\
  \ and we sat on the ground to savor berries and fruits of forest. \n\n\u201CBaa,\
  \ tell us a story\u201D people chorused as they circled around the lady, who I learnt\
  \ was the head of the tribe. \nAs she began telling stories the forest felt silent.\
  \ For hours I listened to new stories of forest, and wondered if my Grandma ever\
  \ knew these stories. In these stories I finally found my place in the forest and\
  \ slowly as I closed my eyes to sleep, I realized that a part of me had changed,\
  \ the canvas of forest that my Grandma and books had painted now felt even more\
  \ beautiful, with stories of Baa added to it.\n\nNow as I type this; in the words\
  \ of Robert Frost \n\u201CTwo roads diverged in a wood, and I\u2014\nI took the\
  \ one less traveled by,\nAnd that has made all the difference.\""
