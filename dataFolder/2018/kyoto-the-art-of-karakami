Text: "Japan\u2019s ancient city and former capital, Kyoto, is still very much alive\
  \ with creative industry, where a marriage of old and new sees modern artisans preserving\
  \ traditional craft techniques.\n\n\nAs I wandered through the charming old textile\
  \ quarter of Nishijin, I passed rows and rows of typical wooden townhouses, many\
  \ of which have been converted into studios by local creatives. Among them, the\
  \ workshop and showroom of Karakami artisan, Kamisoe. Curious to discover more I\
  \ was lucky enough to meet the owner who proceeded to explain his practice in detail.\n\
  \nThe ancient art of Karakami, developed during the Edo period, became one the most\
  \ revered techniques in Japanese heritage craft.  The traditional process, which\
  \ involves printing onto handmade washi paper, evolved over centuries as an intrinsic\
  \ element of Japanese interior design.  \n\nDesigner, Ko Kado, completes the entire\
  \ process of dyeing and printing the paper himself in his atelier. Whilst the printing\
  \ blocks, made of magnolia wood, are expertly carved by local craftsmen in Kyoto.\n\
  \n\nKado explained that nowadays he is one of only a handful of Karakami artisans\
  \ still active in Japan, as modern living leans increasingly towards mass manufacture\
  \ and off-the shelf interior design.  \n\nHaving studied graphic design in San Francisco\
  \ during the late 90\u2019s and subsequently working in agencies\u2019 Ko Kado,\
  \ grew tired of the digital-centric industry and yearned for a more hands on approach.\
  \ He moved back to Japan and re-settled in Kyoto, where he became progressively\
  \ involved in a more artisan way of working.   After honing the technique with master\
  \ craftsmen over the course of 5 years, Ko Kado eventually launched his own atelier.\
  \ \n\n\nThe Kamisoe aesthetic is  distinctly organic, often featuring motifs from\
  \ the natural world. Inspired and in tune with nature one print features linear\
  \ waves that sings of rippled water whilst another references the marbled texture\
  \ of granite.  Natural tones and luminescent finishes feature in abundance, as the\
  \ quietly shimmering surface\u2019s are fundamental in reflecting the light within\
  \ interior spaces. \n\nKamisoe\u2019s designs can be spotted in temples, tea houses\
  \ and boutique hotels across the country. Whilst you can also visit their showroom\
  \ in Nishijin, Kyoto for a chance to see these authentic and contemporary karakami\
  \ prints."
