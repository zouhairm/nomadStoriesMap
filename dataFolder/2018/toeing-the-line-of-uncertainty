Text: "My escape plan from the prison of self-doubt began with the impulsive purchase\
  \ of a ticket to Tasmania. There, I\u2019d embark on a solo, two-week bike tour\
  \ of the island\u2019s rugged mountains and sweeping bays.\n\nI stood in front of\
  \ an abandoned themed bike hire shop in Launceston. The antique bikes basking in\
  \ the harsh sun provided no assurances. I prolonged my departure and peppered the\
  \ owner Douglas with questions in a frenzied attempt to silence my mind.\n\n\u201C\
  How do you change a flat tire? Where do I sleep? Why do the brakes feel dodgy?\u201D\
  \n\nNevertheless, I pedaled away with a grin stretching across my overzealous application\
  \ of sunscreen. For 8 days and 443 km, I pushed my untrained muscles beyond the\
  \ point of soreness, daydreamed about a butt massage, and took downhill turns at\
  \ harrowing speeds.\n\nAs I cycled from coastal Triabunna (pop. 874) through isolated\
  \ rural towns and diverse Eucalypt forests, home to endangered swift parrots and\
  \ forty-spotted pardalotes, to the quaint fishing village of Dunalley (pop. 316),\
  \ paved roads transitioned to scattered rocks resting on yielding sand.\n\nThe fresh\
  \ woodland air in my face intensified as I rode over the crest of another hill.\
  \ I rocketed around a bend unveiling a tight hairpin turn forty yards ahead of me.\
  \ My knuckles turned white as I squeezed my brakes. Nothing. Adrenaline flooded\
  \ my body. My stomach recalled drop tower rides.\n\n\u201CDo I attempt the turn?\
  \ Or do I bail?\u201D\n\nMy heightened senses revealed a suddenly inviting wall\
  \ of bushes and overgrown vegetation to my left; and my last hope. I released my\
  \ death grip to protect my hands and arms from making first contact. I lowered my\
  \ head to shield my face and let the helmet take the brunt of the impact.\n\nI had\
  \ conjured up images of flat tires or walking kilometers to town, but never serious\
  \ injury on the side of a lone country road. The longing of a friend\u2019s support\
  \ crept in as 20 minutes elapsed before the first car passed in either direction.\
  \ Cell phone service was non-existent. Not a soul knew either what town I started\
  \ from that day or my route. First aid was an afterthought.\n\nI\u2019m fortunate\
  \ to have escaped with mere scrapes on my arms and legs. And a still functioning\
  \ bike. Shaking, as I walked off near disaster, sweat dripping down my burnt, dust-covered\
  \ face, I asked myself what\u2019s the line between an impulsive life-altering adventure\
  \ and irresponsible risk?\n\nBut the answer to that thought had to wait. The next\
  \ morning I woke up for another 60 km of open unknown road."
