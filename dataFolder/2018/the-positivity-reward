Text: "Hot, bothered, downhearted and a little lost, I trudged along the winding dirt\
  \ path. Why wasn\u2019t I enjoying myself? I was in Yosemite National Park \u2013\
  \ a destination on my bucket list for years. And now I was here and all I could\
  \ feel was frustration. I'd set off on the Mist Trail just a few hours ago with\
  \ a tour group, but had since abandoned them due to a persistent hankering to be\
  \ alone. To be fair, I had just spent the last four days with them in Las Vegas\
  \ and was left feeling utterly suffocated.\n\nI eventually reached a stream and\
  \ sat myself atop a smooth rock, warm from the sweltering sunlight. \u201CSnap out\
  \ of it!\u201D I told myself. I didn\u2019t want to be feeling so morose. Watching\
  \ the rolling river put me in an almost meditative state and I began to focus purely\
  \ on constructive thoughts. I reminded myself of previous times in which I'd culminated\
  \ positive events through simply changing my mindset.\n\nResuming my solo trek I\
  \ approached a steep, winding path that ran alongside the colossal Nevada Fall.\
  \ I stood for a while and deliberated whether I really wanted to go down. After\
  \ all, the spray from the fall would get me completely soaked, and we\u2019d been\
  \ warned that someone had tragically died just the day before from straying off\
  \ the path. I remembered my pep-talk and gathered up the courage to take the first,\
  \ daunting step down the path.\n\nSoon enough, I felt the corners of my lips curl\
  \ into a giant, uncontainable grin. Sunshine filtered through the mist, giving birth\
  \ to tiny rainbows which adorned the path. I was in awe. \n\nDrenched by this point,\
  \ I stumbled upon a boy about my age coming up the path. He snapped a photo on an\
  \ old film camera and turned to head back down, but something stopped him. \u201C\
  Soaked enough yet?!\u201D he called with a grin matching my own. He had a warm,\
  \ honest air about him. We began chatting and before long we\u2019d learned that\
  \ we were unbelievably similar. I was stunned when he mentioned he was initially\
  \ hesitant to head further up the path to where we\u2019d met - his feelings echoing\
  \ just how I felt about venturing down. How could this be a coincidence?\n\nWe parted\
  \ ways, but something in me knew this wasn\u2019t the last time I would see him.\
  \ Something in me knew that over the next year we\u2019d continue to keep in touch\
  \ from opposite corners of the earth, and that it would be one of the closest connections\
  \ I\u2019d ever formed.\n\nA decision that pushed me to the edge of my comfort zone\
  \ ended up rewarding me with the wonderful, irreplaceable gift of friendship."
