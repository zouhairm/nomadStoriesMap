Text: "In January 2018, my friend from New York flew over to visit me in Auckland,\
  \ New Zealand. We flew to the holy grail of desktop background pictures, Queenstown,\
  \ NZ. Here we picked up our hired Mystery Machine-esque campervan\n\nWe had very\
  \ basic plans, head north, keeping in mind our desired activities when planning\
  \ our stops. I knew along our expedition we would experience challenges, unanticipated\
  \ were the weather induced obstacles that led to my fondest memory of the trip.\n\
  \nThese activities included: skydiving in Queenstown, taking a helicopter to the\
  \ top of Franz Josef Glacier for a tramp, blackwater rafting with glowworms in the\
  \ Waitomo caves, and whitewater rafting in Rotorua, where our raft flipped while\
  \ going over the highest commercial waterfall in the world. As incredible as these\
  \ were, my most cherished memory is of one akin to a walk in the park. \n\nRuapehu\
  \ or Tongariro Alpine Crossing, New Zealand\u2019s oldest National Park, is a popular\
  \ tourist destination. People come from all over the world to walk the 19.4km/12mi\
  \ trek along this active volcano. The popularity of this trek increased dramatically\
  \ after the Lord of the Ring films came out. The mountain featured in the films\
  \ is visible from the trek, and there\u2019s an additional, completely optional\
  \ and unencouraged, path to climb Mt. Ngauruhoe aka Mt. Doom.\n\nIn the early morning,\
  \ we drove to and acquired the last spot in the limited carpark at Ketetahi. From\
  \ there we boarded our shuttle to take us to our chosen starting point, Mangatepopo.\
  \ We felt pleased with our decision to have our van waiting there for us when we\
  \ finished, instead of waiting for a shuttle. \n\nWe knew on the shuttle ride that\
  \ we were in for an arduous journey; there was a thick heavy fog, obstructing our\
  \ vision of 10m ahead. Our ascent to the 1950m high peak of the volcano was additionally\
  \ plagued with sporadic downpours of cold rain, cold wind gusts, with a fun element\
  \ of inconspicuous dangerous steep drops. After 3 hours, with numb fingers, we stopped\
  \ and dug out our snacks with other hardened trekkers, while hiding behind a large\
  \ rock, unspoken regret in our eyes. Shortly after, we reached the peak and then\
  \ the emerald lakes, the halfway point. Miraculously, just moments later, all the\
  \ fog cleared. We admitted to each other that there were moments we desperately\
  \ wanted to turn back. We revelled in the warmth of the forgotten sun for the remaining\
  \ 4 hours, commending ourselves for not giving up, and triumphantly completed the\
  \ trail."
