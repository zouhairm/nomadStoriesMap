Text: "A turquoise tropical city on a large tropical island, Port Antonio sits on\
  \ the Eastern coast of Jamaica. Lush with huge overarching palm trees, enchanting\
  \ blue lagoons, warm rain & a small market with a shop owned by Sister Dawn.\nStanding\
  \ at a small but mighty 5 ft, long luxurious golden 'locs' cascading down her back,\
  \ stopping at her hips, I introduce myself to Sis Dawn as her new guest. Her eyes\
  \ widen as she exclaims \u2018You\u2019re beautiful\u2019 & engulfs my waist in\
  \ a tight embrace. A warmth stirs within me. It\u2019s already emotional.\nTo attempt\
  \ to describe Sis Dawn as beautiful is to do her an injustice. Beauty seems too\
  \ conventional. She has a face embracing of a life unimaginable & a smile that betrays\
  \ her warrior spirit guarding sacred secrets. Golden skin, brown eyes with flecks\
  \ of green & gold she is a physical embodiment of the sandy beaches, lagoons & green\
  \ terrain that dominate this side of Jamaica.\nAs we walk to the guest house all\
  \ the traders greet her with a respect & warmth, their greetings receiving a wry\
  \ smile or slight nod of the head with a regality I\u2019ve never witnessed close\
  \ up.\nMaking our way to drop my bags off I asked if she knew why I was here. She\
  \ replied she knew but she did not understand why I would come. \u2018Have you ever\
  \ been?\u2019 I asked. She hadn\u2019t but she had been curious to. \u201CYou know\
  \ you can\u2019t just go up there right? I will arrange a ride for us and when we\
  \ have permission we will go.\u201D\nMoore (Maroon) Town is settled in the Blue\
  \ & John Crow mountains founded by national heroine Queen Nanny of The Maroons the\
  \ only woman to successfully defeat the British during the Trans-Atlantic Slave\
  \ trade & to establish a fully independent settlement for former runaway slaves.\
  \ Nanny was of the Akan people from the region of Africa now known as Ghana. Royalty\
  \ in her homeland she was also a fierce warrior & her skills were used against Britain\
  \ who eventually signed a treaty granting ceasefire in 1739 after years of warfare.\n\
  Sis Dawn & I shared stories about Queen Nanny's effect on our lives. Us, both black\
  \ women of the African Diaspora, her born in 1940\u2019s Jamaica & surviving a time\
  \ in Jamaica of extreme poverty that required a strength few could muster to navigate.\n\
  The next day we took a taxi from \u2018Porty\u2019 to Maroon Town meeting one of\
  \ the approximately 100 resident locals, Tony & headed up through the mountains\
  \ to Nanny Falls. As we arrived we removed our clothes down to our swim wear and\
  \ dove in.\nBreaking the silence between us once, to take a picture."
