Text: "We went to Morocco to climb Mount Toubkal, the highest peak in North Africa.\
  \ We were foolhardy, unprepared, expecting the sunny Morocco from the movies. What\
  \ we received was something much more human, more important. Morocco taught me about\
  \ adversity, humility, and gratitude. \nThe first day was a steep climb through\
  \ a steady downpour. Shoulders hunched, eyes cast down, no words were spoken. That\
  \ evening, out of the bleakness, our smiling chef proffered, seemingly from nowhere,\
  \ a platter of juicy oranges, salty olives, and tomatoes, followed by warm crusty\
  \ bread and thick slabs of soft cheese. It was the most wonderful thing I\u2019\
  ve ever tasted. \nSpirits bolstered, stories started to emerge. We exchanged tales\
  \ from home, chattering about our siblings and friends. Soon we are thick as thieves.\
  \ \nDays later, we are at base camp, learning that Toubkal is still covered in ice.\
  \ My heart sinks seeing the flimsy pair of crampons offered to me. I wonder if I\
  \ will ever forgive myself if I back out now. \nWe rise at 3 am. I line my destroyed\
  \ boots with plastic bags and slowly start climbing through the pitch darkness.\
  \ There is something magical about it, the silence. Breath rises in steaming columns,\
  \ coming in short gasps. In, out, fast, short. The sky turns from velvet black to\
  \ pink. The snow faintly sparkles. Hope \u2013 we see it again. \nAt the summit,\
  \ we take pictures, smiling fiercely, gritting our teeth. I look at them now and\
  \ don\u2019t remember being there. The exam was over, and we passed. Back down,\
  \ we crawled into sleeping bags, our breath now different. In, out, slow, long.\
  \ Thankful. \nI awoke to the call to prayer \u2013 eerie in the desolate vastness\
  \ of the mountains. Creaking, we crawl out of bed and gather to sip tea by the fire.\
  \ \nI went to Morocco expecting something easy and entertaining. The mountain climb\
  \ was arduous, long, and exhausting. It was the last thing I expected. \nWhat I\
  \ remember most is the people \u2013 smiling, happy. When the day is raining, they\
  \ are thankful for the refreshment. When it\u2019s clear, they are thankful for\
  \ the sun. When the hike is over, they are thankful for the exhaustion. \nWith time\
  \ one forgets the sore feet and chattering teeth. What remains is the silence. That\
  \ thing we don\u2019t seek, and don\u2019t realize we need until it\u2019s there.\
  \ The stillness. The purity. A reminder that we are small creatures in an incredible\
  \ world. \nMy experience was the last thing I expected. And the last thing I expected\
  \ was to love and cherish it. But I did. And I do."
