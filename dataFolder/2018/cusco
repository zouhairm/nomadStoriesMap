Text: "This is not a resort. No one's here to provide you with luxury. The streets\
  \ are not being tidied for you. There is no careful curation of what one sees; the\
  \ ugly bits hidden away. The tiny taxi - an entrepreneur with a car and some stickers\
  \ - drives us to our hospedaje past Andean women and children setting up daily wares\
  \ in slop-filled railway tracks as stray dogs munch casually on piles of trash.\
  \ A man crosses dangerously in front of the fray of traffic with a cow carcass slung\
  \ over his shoulders; a true back-packer. Cusco smells of meat, smoke and cobblestone\
  \ dust. And just a tiny bit of shit. It's easy to be discomforted by this alternative\
  \ way of living. Why does our room have no windows? Why is \"agua caliente\" just\
  \ a euphemism? Why are so many children selling junk on the corners? But to judge\
  \ is to be on the outside looking in. The scent of Cusco isn't a bad one - it's\
  \ just different. The children are gorgeous; rosy cheeked from the high-altitude\
  \ sun. Their mothers are resplendent in their long, hooped braids. If you frown\
  \ at the piles of mismatched fruit on the corner you'll miss the best juice of your\
  \ life. If you chose Starbucks you'll be missing out on more facets of a different\
  \ world. Who knew our favourite meal would be a simple breakfast each morning in\
  \ San Pedro market? Huevo, palta, tomate, and a caf\xE9 con leche at a folding table\
  \ snug next to a family of four watching the market come alive for New Year's Eve.\
  \ We could let the dirt floor bother us or we could accept it and keep our eyes\
  \ up, ready to soak in whatever this city could throw our way. And so we did. New\
  \ Year's is big in Cusco. If you adorn yourself in yellow you'll prosper in 2018.\
  \ If you wear yellow underwear you'll definitely proser in 2018. And as two young\
  \ Uruguayan men told us at 11:58 pm; if you kiss someone at midnight wearing yellow\
  \ you will be invincible in 2018. Plaza De Armas is a tulip field of yellow. In\
  \ anticipation of the great fireworks at midnight, little kids set off homemade\
  \ firecrackers as adults shake bottles into the crowd. Suddenly it's quite possibly\
  \ January 1st as different pockets of the square cheer at different moments. A split\
  \ second later and the Spanish colonial stone around us is lit with a bang from\
  \ above as stranger embraces stranger and revellers run counter clock-wise around\
  \ the square. Someone has drawn glasses on a stray mutt. Everyone is beaming, no\
  \ one speaks the same language, and no one cares. Tonight is the beginning of a\
  \ very good year."
