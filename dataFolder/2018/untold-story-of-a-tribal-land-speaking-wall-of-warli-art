Text: "Dharagiri waterfall is a hidden gem surrounded by tribal clans amidst of the\
  \ lush green forest. It\u2019s a less explored place, landlocked between two mountains\
  \ located at Ghatshila. A rocky landscape of Ghatshila is quite an abandoned place\
  \ at the bank of river Subarnekha flowing endlessly. It was a short trip from Kolkata(268\
  \ Km) to refresh the childhood memory of the tribal land, its people & culture depicted\
  \ in the book \u201CAranyak\u201D written by a famous Bengali novelist. During winter,\
  \ Ghatshila is cold and dry. The local human habitants are simple living tribal\
  \ villager like-Birhor, Oraon, Santhal.This is a great place for making a personal\
  \ connection with the diverse cultural heritage and local indigenous people. At\
  \ the advent of \u2018world cultural tourism\u2019, to immerse in the local traditions,\
  \ has opened up a new window to modern, responsible & ethical tourism worldwide.\
  \ On the way to Dharagiri, you will encounter with local villagers who are still\
  \ living upon hunting & farming. The freedom & attachment between tribes & forest\
  \ have been restricted in consecutive years has significantly affected the lives\
  \ of those marginal people. Most of the tribal houses are neat & clean. The doors\
  \ are painted with folk & tribal paintings with an exceptional color palette filled\
  \ with bold & unbridled colors. Every group has their own form of art, representations\
  \ of emotions & mythological stories in a distinctive way. The \u2018Warli\u2019\
  \ paintings are made by natural vegetative colors on plain clothes which carrying\
  \ the living tradition of art & history of indigenous people over the thousands\
  \ of years. It\u2019s deeply rooted into their blood & culture. Every tribal village\
  \ is the home of local Chitrakars (painters) who beautifully draws scripts with\
  \ the artistic borders & wall paintings, famously Known as \u201Cscroll paintings\u201D\
  . Their fascinating culture & tradition reflects on their hospitality. Agricultural\
  \ occasion is celebrated with the rhythm of Manders with mellifluous countryside\
  \ music & tribal folklore. \nWhile returning from the Ghatshila, mind was occupied\
  \ with all the faces harboring happiness & the curiosity during my journey, thinking\
  \ of the survival & alienation of those ethnicities by constant environmental sabotage.\
  \ As a traveler, the travel experience can only be transformed by the cultural exchange\
  \ & local participation, understanding the social & cultural behavior which has\
  \ a reciprocal effect on the lives of the people around the world what we can perish\
  \ or protect"
