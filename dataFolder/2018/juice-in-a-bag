Text: "Back in the 90\u2019s, there was a trend in Egypt where getting sugar cane\
  \ juice\u2014or any freshly squeezed fruit juice, really\u2014in a plastic bag,\
  \ was cool. It was especially cool in my second-grader eyes because the older kids\
  \ were drinking it this way. The juicers would grind the sugar cane in the back\
  \ of their store, hand a freshly made quart to another man who poured juice in a\
  \ bag, then wrap the bag closed around a straw and hand it to you after they\u2019\
  ve received their pay. From the window of my school bus, I saw two high schoolers\
  \ happily sipping away at the juice, the bag deflating with each sip they took.\
  \ I could smell the sugar cane through the bus window and the sweetness from the\
  \ cane mixed with the hanging Mangoes above the juicer\u2019s stall. My mouth was\
  \ watering at the scent. I desperately wanted the puffy juice-in-a-bag experience\
  \ despite my parents being wealthy enough to afford store bought juice that came\
  \ in cartons. Cartoon characters on a box couldn\u2019t compare to freshly squeezed\
  \ after all. When the bus dropped me off at my home, I ran up the stairs and told\
  \ my mom what I saw excitedly. She shrugged and noted that this trend wasn\u2019\
  t new; that I was excited by it only because I just noticed the other students drinking\
  \ juice like this. \n\u201CI want to get a bag like this but in mango!\u201D \n\
  I told her as if I was stating an order. And she agreed, which only fueled my excitement\
  \ further, but we didn\u2019t get cane juice that day. Or that week. Or that month.\
  \ Instead, I found myself being woken up by my mother at two in the morning to hop\
  \ on a plane headed directly to America. While America was a safer place to be,\
  \ there was no juice in a bag served at my new school, nor were there any juicers.\
  \ Juice was served from a can; and, based off the taste and level of sweetness,\
  \ it was questionable whether it even came from real fruit. \nFor the next 18 years,\
  \ I wondered how the juice in a bag tasted like. I wondered if I could bare the\
  \ Saharan heat and the rush of sand that would blow in my face. I wondered how Egyptians\
  \ changed after the revolution in 2011, or if I could still relate to the culture.\
  \ Come 2015 my mom and I received news of my grandmother falling ill in Egypt. The\
  \ news started a fire in me: this is my chance to stop wondering and try it! And\
  \ I did. And while I savored every moment of drinking raw sugar cane juice in my\
  \ home country, it dawned on me that 18 years of wondering what sugar cane juice\
  \ tasted like was actually 18 years of feeling like a foreigner."
