Text: "It was the 15th of November 2017. In another three days\u2019 time, just like\
  \ their presiding deity, Badri Vishal, the residents of Badrinath would all migrate\
  \ to villages and towns in lower altitudes as the Lord\u2019s seat travels to His\
  \ winter destination for six months \u2013 the Narsingh temple of Joshimath. Life\
  \ at an altitude of 3300m is thus unique and exigent here. Genuinely curious about\
  \ this unusual dual-dwelling lifestyle of the families of Badrinath and adjoining\
  \ villages, we engaged in conversation with a girl, who we found washing her clothes\
  \ under tap water. We learnt that leaving their homes locked, with furniture still\
  \ inside, all of them would move to other places. The cheerful girl told us that\
  \ she was a student of class XI and that she would resume her school in Pandukeshwar\
  \ from December.\nI had a random thought and asked if we could take the bubbly girl\u2019\
  s photograph against the backdrop of the snow-clad Neelkanth Mountain \u2013 the\
  \ mighty peak standing tall behind the temple of Badrinath. The girl kept at her\
  \ giggling best but refused to be photographed. My uncle assured her that she was\
  \ being unnecessarily shy and finally cajoled her into conceding. She tidied herself\
  \ a little and then with a vibrant smile on her lips, mirroring the bright sunlit\
  \ terrain itself, the girl in pink suit, struck a pose alongside my mother. A tilted\
  \ neck and a V-sign with her fingers \u2013 her blend of grace and swag was no less\
  \ impressive than that of the girls of metro cities. And like a child she was so\
  \ delighted at seeing her own photo in my mobile handset that she gladly expressed\
  \ her desire to get clicked again. She took turns to pose with the two families,\
  \ bedecking the frame with her guileless smile. We thanked her for her lovely gesture\
  \ and as we bid her farewell, she asked us to visit the next year too. With good\
  \ humor in her tone, my mother reflected that she might perhaps get married by the\
  \ end of next year. To this, she firmly replied that after completing her Higher\
  \ Secondary studies, she would graduate from college, land herself a job and that\
  \ she would certainly not get married before that.\nInspite of the challenging lifestyle\
  \ that people lead here, the astonishing synthesis of their resolve and exuberance\
  \ is magnificent. It is perhaps due to the humble ways of life that people here\
  \ are so filled with humility and innocence. This girl\u2019s dynamic and ambitious\
  \ inclination sounded exemplary and laudable \u2013 something that will stay in\
  \ our memory for a very long time."
