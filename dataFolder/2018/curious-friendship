Text: "\u201CAs-Salaam Alaikum,\u201D the boy yelled from afar. I could barely hear\
  \ him over the swirling wind, and I was confused as to why he was approaching me\
  \ from up the mountain at such an hour. No matter his purpose there, I hoped he\
  \ would not inquire about mine. \n\nHe continued to approach me, and I could see\
  \ the surprise on his face as he realized I am not Arab. The epiphany that there\
  \ was a foreigner in his remote village quickened his pace, causing me to panic\
  \ that I was unwelcome in his homelands. I had hoped to watch the sunset without\
  \ being noticed, but my plans were dashed. Fears that I was unintentionally trespassing\
  \ crept into my mind, but they were quickly relieved when he excitedly greeted me\
  \ again, this time in broken English. \n\nHis excitement grew when he realized that\
  \ I could speak Arabic with relative success. After exchanging the formal greetings,\
  \ I answered a litany of questions about my hometown in America, my opinion of Oman,\
  \ and my purpose in the mountains near Hameem. Unfortunately, I hadn\u2019t learned\
  \ the word for curiosity; but even if I had, I doubt Ahmed would have cared. Arab\
  \ hospitality knows no limits, especially in mountain villages rarely visited by\
  \ tourists. \n\nMy curiosity had led me through an abandoned citadel, past ancient\
  \ tombs, and up a mountain to watch the Arabian sun set behind the dusty sky. It\
  \ had also gotten me lost. I had only planned to buy frankincense in the nearby\
  \ souk and didn\u2019t have any water. So I quickly accepted Ahmed\u2019s invitation\
  \ to join his family for tea, or shay, as it promised to satisfy both my thirst\
  \ and my need for directions. \n\nAt his home I met to his father and three brothers;\
  \ yet to my dismay, none of them spoke English. My pride in my Arabic was quickly\
  \ broken when it was clear that I had no ability to engage in extended conversation.\
  \ But smiles, laughter, and shared meals transcend language barriers; and though\
  \ we never spoke again, I\u2019m sure Ahmed and his family remember that night just\
  \ as fondly as I do. \n\nAs Ahmed and I walked to my car in the darkness, I was\
  \ amazed that my foreignness had been an attraction to him rather than a deterrent.\
  \ It seemed as if my presence in his village made his day, and I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but feel ashamed of my desire to watch the sunset unnoticed and alone. My curiosity\
  \ led me to explore unknown places, but Ahmed's led him to engage unfamiliar people.\
  \ He taught me that friendship doesn't need to be built upon similarities; curiosity\
  \ to explore the unknown is enough."
