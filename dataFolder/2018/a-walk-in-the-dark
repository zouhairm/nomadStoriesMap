Text: "\"I'll wait here for you\", my driver says as I walk away.\n\nI walk aimlessly\
  \ through the streets with wandering eyes, taking in the smells, colours and smiles.\
  \ Indian people have a certain warmth about them. As I walk, I realise my driver\
  \ has parked further from the Golden Temple than I'd thought. I start to take in\
  \ my surroundings with purpose, so that I can find my way back.\n\nA small girl\
  \ runs towards me, arms out stretched. Another begging child. My heart tugs, but\
  \ I keep walking, knowing there is a man somewhere in the crowd watching her, waiting\
  \ for her success only to take it away. \n\nBefore entering the Golden Temple, I\
  \ cleanse my feet in the holy water and don a scarf to cover my head. I step inside,\
  \ immediately feeling small and insignificant in comparison to the history surrounding\
  \ me. Unfortunately I can't stay long, its getting dark.\n\nAs I walk back, peculiar\
  \ smells permeate from the ever so familiar golden arches. As uncultured as it sounds,\
  \ I've been wanting to try the foreign McDonalds menu. \"Are you sure you want that?\
  \ It's quite spicy\", the local server remarks. I opt for a non-spicy combo meal\
  \ and inhale the burger, leaving the store with fries in hand. \n\nI reach an intersection.\
  \ I don't know which way to go. Fear grabs hold of my stomach. My one rule is to\
  \ be back at my accomodation before dark. \n\nWith the sun about to set, I take\
  \ a deep breath and turn right. Amid the usual hustle and bustle of Indian streets,\
  \ I find myself looking into the brown eyes of the same little girl. She peers up\
  \ at me. What are the chances of us crossing paths again? \n\nThe weight of the\
  \ salty deep-fried potatoes suddenly feels heavier in my hand. I hand the girl a\
  \ French fry. Her expression is something of astonishment, of pure joy. Clearly,\
  \ she has never tried McDonalds. I hand her another fry before I turn and walk,\
  \ fear still clinging to me, wondering how much she has eaten today.\n\nI hear the\
  \ patter of small steps behind me. She's following me. I crouch down and ask her\
  \ name, handing her more fries. For a moment I ignore the night sky overhead. She\
  \ doesn't understand me but we talk briefly using facial expressions and gestures.\
  \ \n\nShe turns to look over her shoulder, fear on her face. It's time to go, I\
  \ hand her the packet of fries. They won't have any value to anyone except her.\
  \ \n\nI don't know what she has to fear, but I'm sure it\u2019s more than finding\
  \ a driver in the dark."
