Text: "One thousand and eighty Buddha\u2019s, eyes cast down, greeted me in Myanmar;\
  \ my jumping off point. Five months in South East Asia with my sister, and she had\
  \ become my safety net in any travel mishaps. It was too cosy: time to test my solo\
  \ mettle. \n\nHalf an hour into the wilderness outside Hpa-An my driver waved goodbye,\
  \ promising to pick me back up at 8AM the next day. 725m above me, hidden by the\
  \ low ceiling of persistent cloud, was Mt Zwegabins\u2019 mountain-top monastery\
  \ where I hoped I wouldn\u2019t be alone in passing my first Burmese night. No phone;\
  \ no way back: my only option was to pass by the eerie Buddhas and begin the climb.\n\
  \nThe path for the most part was roughly hewn steps, cut into the rock face, slippery\
  \ with lichens thriving in the liquid humidity. Twenty minutes in, the foliage parted\
  \ revealing a vast lodge of wood and corrugated iron, its bright colours warped\
  \ by translucent mist. Boarded windows and locked doors echoed the mountain\u2019\
  s desolation. The soupy thickness of the air swallowed sounds, leaving me in a hollow\
  \ sensory bubble. Other climbers could be just ahead of me for all I knew; Buddhist\
  \ monks, silent in prayer could be secreted away behind the building\u2019s fa\xE7\
  ade. \n\nGoosebumps urged me onwards. Ascending through the cloud-line my bubble\
  \ popped. Ahead of me, a ridge stretched out towards a golden-capped Stupa. Framed\
  \ by turbulent oceans of cloud, lay my route forwards. The mountain dropped out\
  \ of sight on either side. Three Stupas punctuated the last arduous hour, but finally\
  \ the Monastery came into view. I forced my jellied legs up one last climb, step\
  \ by agonising step, and crumpled at the top. \n\nI was greeted by a solitary monk\
  \ (the rest remained hidden) and for 7,000MMK was blessed with a yellow, woollen\
  \ bracelet; fed a myriad of bizzare but tasty vegetables and shown to a cardboard-thin\
  \ mattress in a long, dusty dorm.\n\nThe monastic complex was other-worldly in the\
  \ fog. Physically the climb had pushed me to exhaustion, but I am also a wuss and\
  \ my imagination ran riot in the spectral settings. My feverish nerves had been\
  \ toughened by the eerie climb, but managing to sleep here, would be their test.\
  \ Staring out onto the monotonous, white mass of clouds, I steeled myself for a\
  \ long night. \n\nI was proud to have pushed myself this far alone, fear being my\
  \ usual road block to adventure. However, I must admit when I heard three European\
  \ voices behind me I was awash with relief to have companions to banish the ghosts\
  \ back into the mist."
