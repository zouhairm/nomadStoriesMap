Text: "When we\u2019re young, we\u2019re told we can dig a hole to China. By the time\
  \ we\u2019re old enough to know we can\u2019t shovel to Shanghai, many of us hold\
  \ preconceived notions about the world\u2019s most populous country. I\u2019m loath\
  \ to say it, but I was truly nervous about my first visit there\u2014nervous about\
  \ getting lost in a language of characters, wary of smog that dominated headlines\
  \ during the 2008 Olympics, certain I had made a mistake on my visa application\
  \ and would be questioned by authorities.\n\nThese preconceived notions vaporized\
  \ the moment I entered the enormous customs hall. It was orderly and hushed. The\
  \ agent verified my passport quickly and, with a smile, gently waved me through.\
  \ While mundane, this interaction set the stage for the rest of my trip. My route\
  \ to Beijing might not have been through the center of the Earth, but my stereotypes\
  \ about the country were so turned on their head that the air itself seemed to be\
  \ upside-down.\n\nThe country\u2019s capital whispered of other cities, but spoke\
  \ with a voice all its own. \n\nWide leafy bike lines were reminiscent of Paris\u2019\
  s boulevards, but the parks were singular in the sheer amount of activity they contained.\
  \ Dancing grannies everywhere, moving like subdued ballerinas. Office workers\u2014\
  men and women alike\u2014playing hacky sack in their business clothes. Couples practicing\
  \ ballroom with elbows held high.\n  \nWhen I learned 798 Art Zone was in the city\u2019\
  s warehouse district, I erroneously pictured street art in pockets of Brooklyn or\
  \ Berlin. The four-story, red plastic Tyrannosaurus rex at the entrance offered\
  \ a hint at the site\u2019s enormity\u2014decommissioned factories as big as modern\
  \ cathedrals. I only had an afternoon there and felt leaving incomplete. 798 warrants\
  \ a week.  \n\nThe element in which I found no comparison to the outside world was\
  \ the food\u2014slivers of Peking duck wrapped in rice paper, noodle soups with\
  \ beef falling of the bone, platters of cucumbers seasoned with oil and vinegar,\
  \ tender wontons bursting of spice. Each plate was so balanced and so pleasing that\
  \ I finally understood what it means to be an ancient civilization\u2014centuries\
  \ of matching recipes to the human taste bud getting it spot on.\n\nThe last thing\
  \ I expected was to leave Beijing as an evangelist for China, but the delight of\
  \ its surprising-ness and its ability to shake up my stodgy beliefs made me a zealot.\
  \ I share these memories, and dozens like them, with anyone who will listen\u2014\
  emphatic that they add this magical place to their list of must-visits."
