Text: "The Aeolian is an archipelago of seven islands just off the north east tip\
  \ of Sicily. All seven are diverse and each with their own characteristics, being\
  \ Lipari the main one, followed by Vulcano, Salina, Filicudi, Stromboli, Alicudi\
  \ and Panarea, the smallest of all, and to me, also the prettiest.\nThe streets\
  \ here are so narrow that there are only golf buggies to take you around. As you\
  \ get off the boat you feel immediately a sense of relax, as if time had just stopped,\
  \ and the sea breeze mixed with the aromas of freshly cooked food, the deep blue\
  \ sea at one end and the white washed houses all around make the encounter with\
  \ Panarea truly love at first sight.\nThe view from my room at the Hotel Raya is\
  \ breathtaking, beautiful during the day and gorgeous at sunset when the evening\
  \ skies turn into shades of pink and purple and orange. The fact that the bed is\
  \ extremely comfortable also adds value to my stay. I arrive quite late so after\
  \ a plunge in the thermal swimming pool, I order room service and contemplate the\
  \ beauty from the terrace of my suite.\nThe following day as I walk past the beach,\
  \ after a 10 minutes walk up the cliff, I reach the bay of Calajunco. Very few places\
  \ have given me goosebumps like this; the view is simply striking, especially as\
  \ you get closer to the prehistoric village, from where you get a clear view of\
  \ the other islands, as well as of Mount Etna far in the distance. Definitely worth\
  \ the climb.\nThe best way to continue the day is of course with an evening aperitivo.\
  \ An Italian holiday wouldn't be Italian without it.\nAs I leave Bar del Porto and\
  \ walk around the island wondering what to eat for dinner, I come across three wonderful\
  \ boutiques: Paguro, Pucci, and Tinture Naturali.\nA vase, two cushion covers and\
  \ a jumper later, I'm feeling hungry, and  a delicious aroma of freshly home made\
  \ food takes me to Ristorante L'Eoliano! (I love the fact that everything is a two\
  \ minute walk, if!). The host Celeste greets me with a charming welcome in this\
  \ cosy family run restaurant, where I order, to my most joyful surprise, tap prosecco\
  \ and an octopus salad, followed by spaghetti alle vongole for a main.  Delizioso!\n\
  What I love about Panarea is that within hours you see people again, and they start\
  \ greeting you, making you feel at home immediately.\nDon't miss the opportunity\
  \ to visit this little gem, still wild and fairly undiscovered. \nTip: Avoid August\
  \ unless you are looking to share it with hardcore Italian summer holiday money\
  \ splashers!"
