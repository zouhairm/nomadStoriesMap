Text: "-Heads, we drive to Antofagasta de la Sierra to explore those unclimbed rock\
  \ formations we heard of; tails, we continue our way south along Ruta 40 as planned-.\
  \ The coin seemed suspended in the air flipping for a few seconds before falling.\
  \ -Heads!- All my friends exploded, delighted. I had an empty feeling at the pit\
  \ of my stomach, thinking about all places mentioned in my thousand page-Argentina\
  \ travel guide, and the only few weeks remaining before my flight back home. And\
  \ Antofagasta de la Sierra was not in my travel guide. Three pairs of eyes fixed\
  \ their gaze on me, I took a deep breath and, pretending to be confident, smiled:\
  \ -That's great! The die is cast, so let's go to Antofagasta!- \nOne instant later\
  \ we were sitting in the old chata, as Argentinians call the pick-up, leaving the\
  \ Ruta 40 that stretches north-south the 5000 km length of the country from the\
  \ Bolivian border to the end of Patagonia. In front of us, a winding unpaved road\
  \ directly driving into the Puna, the Andean altiplano more than 3300 m above sea\
  \ level. Directly driving into the unknown.\nWe traveled for hours in a lunar landscape\
  \ without finding any other living creature, with the exception of some llamas that\
  \ seemed indifferent to our presence. What we saw during this trip still remains\
  \ imprinted on my retina: endless lava fields, giant white sand dunes, otherworldly\
  \ colored volcanoes, dreamy salt flats, rock pinnacles of the strangest shapes at\
  \ breathtaking altitudes of 4000 m. It was pitch-dark when we finally arrived in\
  \ Antofagasta, cold and silence were so intense that seemed to fill the air, but\
  \ we were lucky enough to find an old lady willing to sell us some delicious home-made\
  \ empanadas.\nThe next day, remembering our main goal here, we left the village\
  \ to explore some rock canyons that extended over kilometers. The air was thin up\
  \ in the puna and we were not feeling in our best shape, but we managed to climb\
  \ some cracks symmetrically cutting the canyon walls, without knowing if somebody\
  \ had climbed up there before. Under the limpid sky, night temperatures dropped\
  \ to -10\xB0C and, even if we had brought our tents and warm sleeping bags, we were\
  \ infinitely thankful to a shepherd that offered us to stay in his hut. We were\
  \ never the same ones after leaving Antofagasta; we had overcome our fears and embraced\
  \ the unknown. Neither it was our pick-up, which became apunao -probably due to\
  \ the dust and the lack of oxygen- and broke down a few hours later. But that is\
  \ another story."
