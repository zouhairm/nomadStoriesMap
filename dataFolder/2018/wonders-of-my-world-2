Text: "Growing up in a country that celebrates diversity, sparked a desire to learn\
  \ more about different cultures and different languages. My interest for learning\
  \ different languages, led to me trying out different foods that belong to different\
  \ cultures, When I was in Durban, I frequently visited the Victoria street market,\
  \ a space that\u2019s rich in culture and heritage. I wanted see everything and\
  \ I knew visiting once was not going to suffice The market housed different stalls\
  \ with spices, Indian cultural regalia, cuisine and the like. I found myself trying\
  \ out different foods, all because I showed interest in how they made the food.\
  \ Nishani, offered different platters of food for free, because of the connection\
  \ we made through having a conversation about Indian cuisine she was kind enough\
  \ to let me try different dishes. \nWhen I was in Limpopo, I made sure I knew how\
  \ to order certain food staples and ask basic directions. Vhagani, our tour guide\
  \ was so intrigued he started asking questions in Sepedi, Our conversation about\
  \ the differences in the Bantu languages, lead to him inviting my friends and I\
  \ to the Fundudzi lake in Venda, we learnt traditional dancing and singing and a\
  \ bit of history. We also got to learn more about the culture from the elders of\
  \ the village. \nMy trip to Johannesburg a year ago was filled with new discoveries.\
  \ A great way to \u201Cfeel\u201D a destination is to allow yourself to wander around\
  \ some of its neighbourhoods. This allowed me to get to know more about people in\
  \ different townships and neighbourhoods. I met Ratang who was so keen on being\
  \ my tour guide, even though I knew my way around. Or at least I thought I did.\
  \ Ratang and I found ourselves lost in a conversation about youth culture in Soweto.\
  \ I visited different youth hubs.the Soweto Theatre Youth and Community Development\
  \ being one of them, the experience was out of this world, because for the first\
  \ time I did not just visit the Nelson Mandela House Museum and the Hector Pieterson\
  \ Memorial. \nThis particular trip to Soweto left me with a new and different view\
  \ of Johannesburg. I stopped being a tourist to him the moment we bonded over language\
  \ I had become \"abuti\", brother. I realized that some of the very best and authentic\
  \ experiences are not planned, and you can easily miss the magic if you are not\
  \ open minded. This also made me realize the importance of local connections. I\
  \ learnt so much about a township I thought I knew. I had rejected the single story,\
  \ of townships being dangerous. I instead found paradise."
