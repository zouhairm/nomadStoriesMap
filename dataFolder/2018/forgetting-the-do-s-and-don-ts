Text: "\u201CHop on,\u201D he says in fluent body language \u2013 no words spoken,\
  \ just a crouching pose and a friendly smile. I take a few seconds to shake off\
  \ my confusion and to my own surprise accept the invitation with a nod before I\
  \ hop on.\n\nThere I am getting a piggyback ride from a complete stranger in the\
  \ city centre of Kyoto. All kinds of thoughts race through my mind. Is it inappropriate\
  \ or unethical to get a ride on someone\u2019s back? A dozen of do\u2019s and don\u2019\
  ts lists and two weeks in Japan have thought me that most social conventions in\
  \ this country can seem bizarre for the European mentality so I struggle to make\
  \ a judgement. Unfortunately, I cannot remember reading any specific advice regarding\
  \ piggyback rides in my guidebooks. Am I safe accepting an invitation from a man\
  \ I just met and cannot communicate with in a country known for its heavily patriarchal\
  \ society? When I was little my mum used to say \u201Cnever follow strangers\u201D\
  \ and I bet this is still on her don\u2019ts list. However, my boyfriend is five\
  \ meters ahead getting a piggyback ride as well - a fact which curiously gives me\
  \ a sense of security.\n\nThe two Japanese men run along a busy pedestrian street\
  \ carrying us without saying a single word. The buildings are heavily signposted\
  \ but I have no idea where I am. A minute ago I asked these strangers for directions\
  \ \u2013 a question posed without words, simply by pointing on a map. Now I am still\
  \ lost in the city, lost in translation and in \u201Cdo\u2019s and don\u2019ts\u201D\
  \ dilemmas. I am conscious that I am heavier than my new friend but I realise that\
  \ getting off a piggyback ride requires a level of communication that my Japanese\
  \ language skills cannot support. The procession of two locals carrying two foreigners\
  \ stops abruptly at a traffic light. The Japanese never jaywalk, even when giving\
  \ a piggyback ride to someone heavier than themselves. \n\nAbout ten minutes later\
  \ we arrive at our destination and get a gentle drop off. The two men bow and so\
  \ do we. I finally get to use one of the few words I know - \u201CArigatou\u201D\
  \ or \u201CThank you\u201D - and quickly go through my bag to find two little sachets\
  \ of Bulgarian rose oil. My mother handed me a bunch of these to give away in Japan\
  \ and even though I ridiculed her at the time and I am glad I have them now. I present\
  \ them to our two friends who say \u201CArigatou\u201D back. You recognise a genuine\
  \ thank you even if you don\u2019t know the words. Seeing that kindness overcomes\
  \ any language barrier I am ready to build more unconventional friendships in this\
  \ foreign land."
