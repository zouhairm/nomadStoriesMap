Text: "\u201CI hate Pocahontas\u201D, my Fijian friend confided in me. We were lying\
  \ on her parents\u2019 bed, facing each other, like mirrored question marks. Throughout\
  \ my stay in Fiji, we had developed this intimate habit of sharing thoughts before\
  \ going to sleep. It felt like talking to the sister I never had. Shozia\u2019s\
  \ parents had moved to sleep on the bure\u2019s palm tree leaved floor. We could\
  \ hear her dad\xB4s snoring through the woven walls. \n\nThe torch light tied to\
  \ the mosquito net sheltering us lit Shozia\u2019s brown eyes which sparkled with\
  \ anger, \u201CPocahontas is exactly what is happening in Fiji. Our girls think\
  \ their best punt at happiness is marrying a foreigner and go far far away from\
  \ Fiji. As a country, we tread on one spot: our best people leave and nobody stays\
  \ behind to develop our home.\u201D \n\nA few weeks ago, Fijian president Ratu Josefa\
  \ Iloilo \u2013 ratu is an old title for a traditional Fijian leader \u2013 had\
  \ dismissed all judges and declared the Government as illegal. Now the 1,000 islands\
  \ nation was back in the hands of the military - for the fourth time in 30 years.\
  \ \n\nTo me Pocahontas had always been a story about love that crosses cultural\
  \ boundaries. To Shozia it was a representation of the brain-drain that damaged\
  \ her country. Throughout my four weeks in Fiji, I had shared kava, a muddy drink\
  \ from pepper roots that numbs the tongue, with many good-humoured Fijians. The\
  \ men\xB4s frequent laughter warmed the night\u2019s darkness. In the bure, one\
  \ story as present as the laughter, singing and sense of community spoke about departure.\
  \ Everyone knew someone who had left for grander places; everyone had their own\
  \ plans to leave Fiji. Some men told me their European girlfriends would send them\
  \ money to buy airline tickets. Fijian women were a rare sight at these night-time\
  \ kava ceremonies. \n\nSinging along in melodic scales to my ukulele\u2019s music,\
  \ and watching distant nebulas in the clear night sky, I could not imagine why anyone\
  \ would want to leave this paradise \u2013 except for its lack of warm showers.\
  \ Even my Indian taxi driver in his rusty beige Toyota had two tiny American flags\
  \ on his car\u2019s dashboard. He assured me that he would move there someday to\
  \ live \u201Cthe life they have on TV.\u201D Then he charged me triple the amount\
  \ of Fiji dollars I had paid last time, because I was white and I could afford it."
