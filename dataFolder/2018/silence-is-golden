Text: "\u2018Was it your first time?\u2019 \n\nHer voice was not how I expected it\
  \ to be. Slightly courser and deeper than her small frame would suggest, with an\
  \ accent I couldn\u2019t quite place. European, maybe.\n\nOut of habit I nodded,\
  \ before realising I could finally speak.\n\n\u2018I like your shirt.\u2019\n\n\
  She laughed. With my Filipino face and Australian accent, I suppose that was not\
  \ what she was expecting either after ten days of silent company.\n\n\nI met her\
  \ on day one at chore time. Thankful I did not end up with toilet duty for my ten\
  \ days here, I grabbed the mops we had been given whilst ducking my head gravely\
  \ with obvious sympathy as I passed by those who were less fortunate. A shadow moved\
  \ along the forecourt in front of me and I looked up to see a girl, smiling as she\
  \ reached across me for a mop. She wore fisherman pants and a track jersey with\
  \ the name of what I assumed was her university. I smiled back.\n\nLater that night\
  \ fire ants stormed into my bed, following the scent of the crumby remains of my\
  \ last sweet indulgence before I signed myself up to the confines of the hermitage.\
  \ It was a literal sting in the arse, just in case the hard, concrete slab of a\
  \ mattress was not enough of a welcome. Expressing my fury scrambling up in pain\
  \ and fists clenched, I yelped, but my voice shrunk in obedience to the rules of\
  \ the silent retreat until my frustration slowly petered out into the night and\
  \ the ominous peal of the bell rolled in to signal a new day.\nRoutine eased my\
  \ initial teething pains as I adjusted into the rhythm of the monastery. The shag\
  \ of my mop swished across the floor in silent choreography with the runner girl\
  \ as our mops met from across the hall each day. I would follow the wind running\
  \ through the grass, rustling the trees that grasped at the sun, silently listened\
  \ to life being birthed anew, all happening around me regardless of my voice not\
  \ being amongst it. Within the confines of the refuge we somehow seemed so far away\
  \ from the cacophony of the world that rushed around it.\n\nFinally, after ten days,\
  \ we stood across each other, our bags packed and having just been dismissed. The\
  \ path I entered through ten days ago weaved up the hills in the distance, and I\
  \ envisaged the sounds of the outside world welcoming us: touters bellowing in Thai,\
  \ tuk-tuk drivers weaving through and the sound of the ferry heaving in to send\
  \ us off.\n\n\u2018Well, all the best out there.\u2019\n\nWith that I watched her\
  \ walk ahead of me, breaking into a sprint with the wind."
