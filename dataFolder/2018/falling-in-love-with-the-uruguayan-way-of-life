Text: "In my last trip with my classmates, we decided Cuba was the perfect setting\
  \ to close this incredible journey together. I fell in love. I knew part of me was\
  \ staying there forever. And shortly after, I found my next calling. An e-mail that\
  \ invited me to finish my studies in Montevideo. I didn\u2019t think it twice.\n\
  \nThe flame that my experience in Cuba has sparked was building up and I wanted\
  \ to see yet a new thing, meet new people, dive into a new culture and a new lifestyle\
  \ that would enrich mine.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t love at first sight, but it was definitely\
  \ love. Little by little I got into the Uruguayan way of living. While being there,\
  \ my friends and I traveled around. First trip: to Buenos Aires, of course. We continued\
  \ to Iguazu and the 22 hours by bus were absolutely worth it. Every kilometre we\
  \ traveled was better than the previous one.\n\nAfter my six months living in Montevideo,\
  \ I ended up loving its people, its education, how everyone seemed so happy with\
  \ so little. Drinking mates in La Rambla, dancing cumbias till dusk, Tristan Navaja.\
  \ And I took photos of everything, cause everything mattered so much. Every street,\
  \ every corner, every door was a piece of art in its own. I fell in love with the\
  \ accent, with the burning sun, with the river breeze.\n\nLiving in a house with\
  \ sixteen people from different parts of the world opened my mind.  I lost some\
  \ prejudice, and I submerged in a global environment of which I knew so little about.\
  \ I felt so many things. This experience changed me for the better.\n\nAt the end\
  \ of my stay I traveled again for a couple of weeks: Peru, Bolivia and Chile. Going\
  \ up to Machu Picchu, Aguas Calientes, Titicaca Lake. Visiting La Paz, Uyuni y Atacama.\
  \ I got over my fears of flying alone. I took my backpack with very little things\
  \ and I carried all the weight it gained on every corner. I talked to everyone who\
  \ would listen and wanted to talk. I tried every food and I liked it. There were\
  \ no close doors. Everything was new and exciting. \n\nIt seemed like minutes. I\
  \ was a new person, with different hopes and dreams, more open and less judgmental.\
  \ More kind and trusting of others. And most of all, more confident. Without realizing\
  \ it in that moment, that trip saved me from growing fearful and scared of leaving\
  \ my comfort zone. It saved me from taking a wrong turn and it taught me that it\
  \ was ok to take the wrong turn because failure is the best teacher."
