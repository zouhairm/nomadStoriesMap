Text: "In every culture, there is a rite of passage. Boys become men and girls become\
  \ women through participation in rituals that have been celebrated for hundreds\
  \ of years. Outsiders do not often get to glimpse these traditions, but the Maasai\
  \ Tribe graciously invited our small group of Rocky undergraduates, to attend the\
  \ Eunoto. This is the ceremony of dividing the age-set within the Maasai tribe of\
  \ Kenya and Tanzania. It is only held every ten years. Eunoto is to celebrate boys\
  \ who are to become warriors and warriors to become elders. We were the only foreigners\
  \ there but the tribe had welcomed us like close friends. Thousands of Maasai men\
  \ and women were present at the ceremony, wearing traditional clothing and beading.\
  \ A group of new warriors whooped and hollered as they performed the adamu or jumping\
  \ dance. Another group formed a line and the man at the front banged a shield on\
  \ the ground and called out threats to an imaginary lion. A few men from my group\
  \ were welcomed into the dance and we could see them jumping as high as they could\
  \ into the air, but they could not beat the Maasai. The women, on the other hand,\
  \ were doing their own dance. Some of the Maasai lent us their beaded headwear and\
  \ necklaces to wear as we danced with them. An old woman led the group and we lined\
  \ up to follow. They sang and swayed to the music. It took a while, but soon we\
  \ were able to follow the woman's steps. I broke off from the line, deciding to\
  \ take a few photos of the dance. I felt a tap on my shoulder and found a small\
  \ Maasai woman holding an infant. She smiled and grabbed at my ears. After a quick\
  \ inspection, she stepped back and held up a pair of clay earrings. I bent down\
  \ and allowed her to put them in. It took a while, since I hadn\u2019t worn earrings\
  \ for over three years, but after a good five minutes, they were in. The women examined\
  \ her work, shook my hand then walk away. Confused I grabbed at the earrings thinking\
  \ I needed to give them back. A translator who stood beside me stopped the woman.\
  \ They talked and then the woman turned and said something to me in Swahili; the\
  \ guide translated, \u201CThey are a gift from the Maasai. You and your group have\
  \ been a pleasure upon us. Keep the earrings.\u201D She then left with a group of\
  \ other mothers. I could hear the songs behind me silence as it was time for the\
  \ celebration to end. We went back to our vehicles, our bodies covered in dirt from\
  \ the dry land, but that did not matter to us as we were a part of the land now."
