Text: "Since I was a kid, I enjoyed traveling, I would have loved to travel more but\
  \ circumstances in my life did not allow it to happen. My sick dad went bankruptcy\
  \ and most of my income went to support him. My family faced financial crisis and\
  \ these years were very dark for me. The year after he passed, which was 2015, has\
  \ been the worst year of my life. I reached levels of anxiety so high that led me\
  \ to suffer eating problems. I was mentally and emotionally sick.\nIn 2016, I decided\
  \ to unplug myself from all these issues and went to Buenos Aires for three months\
  \ just to LIVE. Unexpected things happened to me in Argentina, things that I never\
  \ imagined I could have lived and unexpected people arrived to my life also. The\
  \ purpose of my trip was a break from my busy life and then come back to my country,\
  \ to my reality, but once there, I realized that I am the owner of my destiny.\n\
  It was not difficult to decide to stay all 2016 in Argentina. I work remotely, so\
  \ I could do this. If I would have never left Ecuador, I would have not found myself\
  \ making the decision of wanting to live traveling. The idea of making my routine\
  \ far from \u201Chome\u201D was irresistible and I understood that \u201Chome\u201D\
  \ is not where we are born, but where we feel we belong to. I had a complete transformation\
  \ in my life that I was not expecting at all, but it came to me and I embraced it.\
  \ I must say that in Buenos Aires I started eating again normally and by the end\
  \ of 2016 I had put on 25 pounds.\nI ventured into yoga and continued my psychoanalysis\
  \ therapies, both things were key points to my awakening. I like to say that psychoanalysis\
  \ opened my eyes and yoga accompanied me in this process making my path smoother.\
  \ I started a valuable path of self-discovery.\nIt was in Argentina where I started\
  \ writing. I felt the necessity of sharing my discoveries in written through a blog,\
  \ which you can check in the blog space provided below. Writing has been one of\
  \ the most enchanted things that has happened to me as it has shown me a \u201C\
  talent\u201D that I had hidden.\nI still remember the night I landed in Argentina\
  \ back in February 2016 with no established plan and kind of scared because of my\
  \ mental barriers and look at me now, 25 pounds on! Moving to Buenos Aires has been\
  \ the best decision I have ever made in my life. It unleashed the power inside me\
  \ and it marked a new cycle for me, a cycle that freed me from chains I have put\
  \ to myself unconsciously for several years and a cycle that brought peace and love\
  \ to my life."
