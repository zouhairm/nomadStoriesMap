Text: "A few years ago I traveled with an Australian friend through the Chilean Patagonia\
  \ by motorbike. We decided to cross the border to Argentina to spend Christmas in\
  \ El Chalt\xE9n, a small town surrounded by mountains, the perfect place to enjoy\
  \ the landscape and hiking. After a seemingly endless ride against strong winds,\
  \ we arrived there, exhausted and not sure where to sleep. Most places were either\
  \ fully booked or too costly. \n\nMy friend had seen a possible house on Couchsurfing\
  \ but hadn\u2019t yet had a response from the hosts, but with the light fading,\
  \ we felt like just trying our luck and knocking on their door. It was a tiny house\
  \ resembling a shop, which still looked unfinished and not open. An amiable, hippie-looking\
  \ woman opened the door. After telling her of our plight, she explained that while\
  \ the advertised beds were already filled we were welcome to pitch a tent in their\
  \ garden.\n\nWe entered. The house was sparse and simple with just two rooms, with\
  \ three single beds and a double bed, divided by a bookcase, a kitchen, and a bathroom.\
  \ Surprisingly, there were already two other tents in the garden. Welcomed into\
  \ the kitchen we found seven people gathered around the table: her husband and two\
  \ sons, a Colombian who was hitchhiking through South America, a Brazilian and a\
  \ Dutchman traveling by bike and an American using the bus. They were all sleeping\
  \ in the main room with the family or in a tent outside. That night ended with delicious\
  \ food made by the Colombian and shared stories of traveling and cultural differences.\n\
  \nThe next day was Christmas Eve. To provide Christmas dinner for all, we collected\
  \ some money and went shopping with the family. The dad got a small piglet to grill\
  \ and we bought fresh vegetables and other treats.\nThat night, we prepared the\
  \ dinner together and the Mum taught me how to make a traditional Chimichurri sauce\
  \ to accompany the meat. Later I joined the piglet-grilling father and his 10-year-old\
  \ son outside to toast some marshmallows- the son had never seen anything like this\
  \ in his life before. In fact, he loved them so much and got so excited that I decided\
  \ to give him the entire bag. \n\nDuring a quiet moment, I asked the father how\
  \ he felt about opening their door to so many strangers and sacrificing a lot of\
  \ their privacy. He replied; \u201CWe want to show our sons the world but we just\
  \ can't afford to travel. That\u2019s why we decided to invite the world into our\
  \ home so that we can grow and learn from other cultures without leaving!\u201C"
