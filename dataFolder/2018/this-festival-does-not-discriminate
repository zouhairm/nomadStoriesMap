Text: "The narrow lanes of Sonagachi are nothing like anything which you\u2019ve seen\
  \ before. Dilapidated buildings loom on both sides of the road, roots of ancient\
  \ trees crack open the narrow pavements, stray dogs nose around in the garbage lying\
  \ openly by the gutters. \nAsia\u2019s largest red-light district is a place where\
  \ one does not go casually. It is not a colorful place like the Walking Street of\
  \ Pattaya or De Wallen of the Netherlands; here you will not find bright lights,\
  \ fancy establishments, and hordes of gawking tourists. Sonagachi just exists in\
  \ its own shadows.\nBut tonight is a different night. Rows of fairy lights stretch\
  \ as far as the eye can see. Intricately designed pandals, structures made from\
  \ cloth and bamboo, house the Goddess and her children. The city of Kolkata is celebrating\
  \ Durga Puja to mark the vanquishing of evil by the Goddess Durga. The insides of\
  \ the pandal twinkle with the light of the chandeliers above. \n\u201CMemsahib has\
  \ come to see our Puja?\u201D a woman asks me on seeing my female companion who\
  \ is from Sweden. Western women are a rare sight in this part of the city. On any\
  \ other night this lady would have been soliciting on the streets but tonight she\
  \ is free from her drudgery. Her make-up is as garish as her yellow saree, but all\
  \ that is not to draw clients, it is for herself. Tonight, she is celebrating.\n\
  \u201CYes, we are here to see the aarti.\u201D \nTradition dictates that before\
  \ the idol of the Goddess is cast, the first handful of clay must come from the\
  \ \"forbidden areas\" \u2013 where men leave behind their piety and virtue at the\
  \ doorway before entering this world of sin. Apparently, the soil becomes blessed\
  \ on imbibing all that virtue.\n\u201CCome, I\u2019ll get you a front row seat.\u201D\
  \nShe takes my companion by the hand and calls out to the others to make space for\
  \ us in front of the platform where the priest is chanting hymns to the Goddess\
  \ and waving the sacred flame lamp in front of her. Smoke fills the air tinged with\
  \ the flowery smell of incense. \nThe fire reflects off the eyes of the women surrounding\
  \ us; almost as if the fire is within them. As we gratefully accept the offerings\
  \ of fruit and sweets, I realize that the mightiest Goddess in Indian mythology\
  \ is not complete if it not were for these \"fallen\" women. \nJust as the Goddess\
  \ protects us all; on this night we have found a friend and protector in the woman\
  \ wearing a yellow saree."
