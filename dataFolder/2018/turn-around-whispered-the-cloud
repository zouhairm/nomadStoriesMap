Text: "What I like the most about swimming underwater is the feeling of entering into\
  \ another dimension. A dimension with different codes, where the heaviest creatures\
  \ on the planet fly harmlessly, and the gelatinous soft bodied ones are the deadliest.\
  \  A dimension in constant motion, like a breathing organism you can tune your soul\
  \ to.\nThe sea is a big part of my life. I am drawn to it, so naturally, when I\
  \ arrived in Mexico, after leaving cold Europe, twelve hours of flight and three\
  \ hours of \"collectivo\" (a Mexican local bus), the first thing I wished to do\
  \ was to go for a swim. Tulum is where I ended up, a city along the Riviera Maya\
  \ on the eastern side of the Mexican coast. The Caribbean side: white sandy beaches,\
  \ crystalline waters and the slight smell of sunblock and fried fish around the\
  \ areas where Humans gather. Why Tulum? probably because of its Mayan heritage.\
  \ A civilisation I heard many stories about. Stories involving secrets long forgotten,\
  \ mystery and controversy. For sure it was a place for the Sherlock in me. But before\
  \ finding myself in awe with the Ruins of such a rich culture, I had some underwater\
  \ exploring to do. \nSnorkelling in Mexico feels like being teleported from your\
  \ sofa straight into the discovery channel. You could almost ear the voiceover :\
  \ \"Many species live in the Mesoamerican Barrier reef, from microorganisms to shoals\
  \ of colourful fish, swimming together for protection as many predators are on the\
  \ look-out...\"\nI started following an odd looking stingray hiding in the sand.\
  \ \"Have you seen any Turtles?\" I telepathically asked the ray. \"One blink for\
  \ Yes, two for No.\" She stared at me with her alien-like black eyes and blinked\
  \ three times. She did not speak human... Distracted, I did not realise I was getting\
  \ considerably far from the shore. \"Just keep swimming\" I was singing in my head,\
  \ forgetting the notion of time, space or safety. It was when a cloud obstructed\
  \ the sunlight, making the reef look treacherous all of a sudden, that I started\
  \ to sweat. The corals I found beautiful a second ago turned into sharp threatening\
  \ death-sticks. All my senses in alert, I was now expecting the scariest monsters\
  \ to come out of the deep to taste exotic European food. I lifted my head above\
  \ water and almost fainted to see how far I was from the beach. Could those creatures\
  \ smell fear? My brain rewired from Disney to Jaws instantly. I think I might have\
  \ beaten a swimming world record that day. Shame only the rays saw it!"
