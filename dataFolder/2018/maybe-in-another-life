Text: "This story is about one of the most peculiar experiences of my life... It was\
  \ as if I had been transported into another era of another universe. Kinda like\
  \ when you're watching an old film... except this time I was in the film.\_ For\
  \ a moment, I had completely forgotten that I was in Buenos Aires. The only reminder\
  \ being the voice of my new friend, M, speaking to me non-stop in Argentine Castilian.\n\
  \nWhere was I?\n\n...Inside the 1914 (now closed-down) iconic Harrods building in\
  \ Buenos Aires - home to M for the last 8 years! (I didn't even know there was a\
  \ Harrods here!)\n\nUp to the point when I stepped in the from the hole in the corrugated\
  \ iron door on Florida (one of the best-known pedestrian shopping streets in Buenos\
  \ Aires), into a vast, eerily dark and hollow ground floor, I still thought M had\
  \ been kidding about the fact that he lived here.\n\n\"Wait, what?! You mean this\
  \ entire 7-storey 1900s building is your home? And you live here by yourself?!\"\
  \n\nAt which point, he reiterated again with a shy smile, \"S\xED, no es broma.\
  \ Esto es mi casa.\"\n\nMy brain exploded.\_\n\nTurns out, one of M's wealthy (and\
  \ stubborn) great uncles bought the entire luxury department store back in its heyday\
  \ some 30 years ago and refused to resell it to the likes of Falabella (Chile),\
  \ El Corte Ingl\xE9s (Spain) and Printemps (France), after it closed down 20 years\
  \ ago due to the economic downturn in Argentina. This was Harrods' only branch outside\
  \ of the UK.\n\nWe headed across the empty space, lit only with the torch from M's\
  \ phone, to an entrance labelled \"Peluquer\xEDa Caballeros\" (Gentlemen's Hair\
  \ Salon). I stared down the set of stairs thinking if I were to have found myself\
  \ here, alone, I'd be spooked beyond words! And this loco lives here... with all\
  \ the fantasmas (ghosts). The salon had all the old chairs and basins intact, including\
  \ children's high chairs. This could be a scene of a horror movie!\n\nNext was a\
  \ peek at the garage, where I was greeted generously by the smell of mould. 18 of\
  \ M's great uncle's vehicles still lived here, parked at random, including a 1980s\
  \ Cadillac. Apparently, the man had a penchant for purchasing things, but was not\
  \ equally enthusiastic about selling (can someone say hoarder?). So when a vehicle\
  \ became unusable, he simply bought a new one. (Makes total financial sense!\_)....\n\
  \nThis was very difficult to cut, if you're interested in this story, please continue\
