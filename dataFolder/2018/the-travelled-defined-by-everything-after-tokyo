Text: "They say that as a traveller you are defined by \u201Cyour time before Tokyo\u201D\
  \ and \u201Ceverything after Tokyo\u201D.\nIt was early December 2015 when after\
  \ 28 hours of continuous travelling, I arrived in what I would later call the best\
  \ city on the planet. It was nearly 10 pm by the time I boarded the monorail from\
  \ Haneda towards the Tokyo Station. Once I entered the train, I could have sworn\
  \ that in reality, I passed the gates through another dimension. This was no ordinary\
  \ ride, I told myself, as if I somehow entered Murakami\u2019s 1Q84. Through the\
  \ veil of tiredness, I was partaking in one of the most vivid, lucid dreams I\u2019\
  ve ever experienced. The speedy train took me above and beyond several multilayered\
  \ roads and expressways. The carriage was almost entirely empty, except a couple\
  \ of Japanese people, dressed in suits, marvelling at their phones. Salarymen going\
  \ home from a long day at the office, I thought to myself. I looked through the\
  \ window, just to see a sea of skyscrapers, multicoloured streets and establishments.\
  \ I was part of the city, I could see my future unfolding right in front of my eyes,\
  \ as Tokyo seemed the perfect metaphor for a great sci-fi movie.\nMy journey continued\
  \ out of the subway and through the Tokyo station, a multistory shopping mall which\
  \ also served the purpose of a train station. The bright lights, sexy adverts and\
  \ sheer amount of eateries dotted all throughout this impressive building gave me\
  \ the reassurance I needed, that I was not dreaming, but experiencing the most phenomenal\
  \ journey of my life.\nIt was close to 11 pm by the time I managed to find my exit\
  \ out of the Tokyo Station. It was cold and dark, yet I\u2019ve never my life felt\
  \ more serene about a new cityscape. I was now standing in front of those gigantic\
  \ skyscrapers I was eagerly admiring earlier from the moving monorail. I looked\
  \ up and marvelled at these buildings, the perfect futuristic architecture which\
  \ made me feel small, made me feel human. What struck me most about Tokyo, was this\
  \ perfect silence all around me, despite my central location. It wasn\u2019t the\
  \ eerie type of quiet, as there were cars and people on the streets, but I was surrounded\
  \ by a deep silence. And so, I quietly began my walk towards my hotel. \nThis was\
  \ no dream, I was not a lost character in one of Murakami\u2019s books. This was\
  \ the beginning of my most memorable adventure in the greatest city on Earth. This\
  \ was my journey of self-discovery, through which I became the traveller defined\
  \ by \u201Ceverything after Tokyo\u201D."
