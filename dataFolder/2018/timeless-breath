Text: "The lines beneath are a collection of words that certify to the needs of a\
  \ story, which is now a comprehensive non-fiction travel literature book titled,\
  \ 'Timeless Breath.' \n\nIt is a story of a young man from India working in Brooklyn\
  \ as a Door-to-Door salesman for a startup solar company where he was immersed in\
  \ living the quintessential American Dream and learning about human behavior through\
  \ crafting the perfect sales pitch. He achieved financial, personal and social success\
  \ early in his career and could see his dreams manifesting into a vivid reality.\
  \ Until one night, an inner voice surfaced out of the darkness and compelled him\
  \ to renounce his long-held plans and instead go \u2018seek the truth\u2019 behind\
  \ human existence and discover his true purpose in life.\n\nWith nothing but a bare\
  \ heart and abiding hope, he courageously risked everything he had worked for and\
  \ relinquished the world as he knew it, a world governed by misinformation, ignorance,\
  \ conflict, greed, hate and selfishness. He begins down an unknown path which guides\
  \ him on a transformational journey to Peru, South America, where he spends time\
  \ to experience life in a state of complete vulnerability surrounded by a culture\
  \ and language that\u2019s foreign to him, and with no family or friends by his\
  \ side. \n                                                                     \
  \         \nThe man\u2019s unwavering determination to conquer all his fears infuses\
  \ him with an ability to listen to his true calling from deep within the Amazon\
  \ Jungle where, after uniting with Mother Ayahuasca, his true purpose in life is\
  \ revealed along with a message significant for all humans to stand united against\
  \ the despair synonymous with our current age. He is shown that the world is more\
  \ unstable than ever before and threatens the survival of our species unless all\
  \ of humanity combine in an effort to deliver to our future generations a planet\
  \ that is more peaceful, stable and is built upon the roots of love and compassion."
