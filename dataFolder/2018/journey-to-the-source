Text: "Abril, her arm draped over my shoulder, mumbles in my ear. \u201CTengo frio,\u201D\
  \ I\u2019m so cold, she says repeatedly. Night has fallen and with it the temperature.\
  \ Our windbreakers, so suited for the planned day hike, are useless protection against\
  \ the frigid air. I stop to peel off my gloves, offering them to her wordlessly.\
  \ At 17,000 feet elevation, I can barely breathe, much less talk.\nIt feels like\
  \ a lifetime ago that we left the fire behind. Huddled in the abandoned alpaca herder\u2019\
  s hut, searching for warmth under flea-ridden animal pelts, we wouldn\u2019t survive\
  \ a night without provisions. So, we moved forward.\nF*ck! The moss-covered rock\
  \ appears out of nowhere, sending Abril and I spiraling to the ground. Just hours\
  \ ago, they glimmered bright green under the scorching Peruvian sun. Reaching the\
  \ summit with whoops of delight, multicolored flags blowing in the wind, we crowded\
  \ around the trickle of water that becomes the mighty Amazon River. Yet as the trek\
  \ down stretched much too long, and gleeful energy turned to anxious whispers, it\
  \ became evident that Zacarias, our guide, had lost the trail. Now we are sixty\
  \ teenagers utterly lost in the Andes Mountains.\nI am still on the ground. Knees\
  \ weak, heart pumping, lungs screaming for a trickle of oxygen, I lift my face to\
  \ the sky. If only I could read the path out in the stars, I think. How nice it\
  \ would be to render my body to the gravel below me. \nBut a hand touches my shoulder.\
  \ His other brings a cup to my mouth. The hot water stings my chapped lips and I\
  \ close them in protest. \u201CBebelo\u201D \u2013Drink it \u2013 he says gruffly.\
  \ I cannot find the words to complain so I do, letting the hot liquid warm my mouth,\
  \ throat, chest.\nThe hand clasps mine firmly and suddenly we are walking again.\
  \ Minutes pass, or perhaps hours, when blinding lights pierce the night. Shouts,\
  \ tears, a \u201Cgracias a dios\u201D.  A man in army uniform is racing towards\
  \ me and I collapse into his blanket. \u201CNo pasa nada, estan a salvos.\u201D\
  \ \u2013You are safe. Abril, I whisper, where is Abril. But as I turn my head she\
  \ is there beside me. \nAbril sleeps the entire bus ride back, but the bumpy road\
  \ lulls me in and out of consciousness. The rising sun illuminates a hooded figure\
  \ in the distance. A man is walking alongside the highway. The bus comes to a screeching\
  \ halt and opens its doors to Zacarias. I guess he found the trail after all.\n\
  Puto Zacarias, I think. You almost killed us. But I can\u2019t help but smile as\
  \ I close my eyes; he\u2019s just given me the adventure of a lifetime."
