Text: "Travelling to Cancun with my daughter gave me the unique opportunity to fulfil\
  \ her dream of swimming with sharks. It was smack in the middle of breeding season\
  \ for whale sharks. I just couldn't resist. \n\nAlthough we arrived from the warmth\
  \ of the summer in Canada, stepping out onto the tarmac in Mexico was a delight.\
  \ Being accosted by the smothering heat was the main purpose of our trip.\n\nWhile\
  \ Cancun is brimming with touristy hotels, venues and shops, we chose to stay in\
  \ a resort away from the throbbing of the nightclubs in the hotel zone. I secretly\
  \ booked our excursion and informed Hannah that we were going on a tour and what\
  \ to bring.. Of course, when the guide hopped out of the van and called, \"Whaleshark\
  \ tour\", the secret was no longer, and she turned to me, her whole being emanating\
  \ pure joy. \n\nOur companions consisted of several couples and a family of four.\
  \ We had about a forty-five minute drive to the marina, where we were all fitted\
  \ with wetsuits and flippers. Once on board the boat, we were given some general\
  \ information and the snorkelling equipment. None of us were prepared for the boat\
  \ ride out to sea, where the whale sharks were known to frequent. It was extremely\
  \ turbulent and some of the passengers were not faring well. \n\nThe water was crystalline\
  \ to begin with, and shimmered as the sun reflected off the surface. Farther out,\
  \ the water became darker and opaque. Gradually, several boats appeared and grew\
  \ larger on the horizon. Our vessel steered towards them. Before I knew it, fins\
  \ were breaking the surface around us.. My heart thumped as we readied ourselves\
  \ to join these magnificent creatures. As we entered the water and began swimming\
  \ alongside one of the sharks, it was the most surreal moment. Hannah was in awe.\
  \ To be within a few feet of this massive, gentle being, in the silence of the underwater\
  \ world, with his eye on us as he passed by, is a moment I will hold precious for\
  \ always.\n\nOnly three of us on the trip back were not ill, Hannah, myself and\
  \ one other. I would recommend, for those who have not travelled in choppy waters,\
  \ to bring along some travel sickness pills. \n\nOur guide stopped by some reefs\
  \ to give us the opportunity to snorkel in shallow waters. At one point I removed\
  \ my snorkel, and my mouth felt strange. It was then that I realized I had lost\
  \ my denture! Thank goodness it was shallow water. I spotted it and, mortified,\
  \ had to ask one of the guides to retrieve it for me. That was the last thing I\
  \ expected to happen."
