Text: "Is it morning? Evening? What is this strange time where the sunlight isn\u2019\
  t sure of itself? I should be working in Alabama. Instead, I\u2019m standing in\
  \ an ordinary room in the middle of a national park in Scotland called Loch Lomond\
  \ and the Trossachs. I find two large curtains and carry them in opposite directions.\
  \ This reveals a window marbled with dead ladybugs and other various insects. I\
  \ wipe off the built up moisture with my sleeve.\n\nI was told in a nearby town\
  \ that miles of trails spread out in all directions.  Some weave in and out of villages\
  \ and skirt the edges of the numerous lochs. Other trails cross rivers and use a\
  \ wooden bridge to connect the broken Earth. They all meander and switchback and\
  \ climb and occasionally reach an end.\n\nI came here to run. I squeezed into my\
  \ black running pants, laced up a pair of 8 year old running shoes that has a total\
  \ of 8 holes and no traction, put on my white waterproof bag filled with warm clothes,\
  \ water, and snacks.\nThere is nothing quite like trail running. The smells, the\
  \ trees, the sheep, the fallen leaves, the little creatures scaring me, and the\
  \ lack of people and pollution, I would drop everything for this. I came here to\
  \ run away.\n\nThe nearest mountain peak was Ben Lomond, my goal. I set out just\
  \ at sunrise and was accompanied by a light rain. The trails were slick and rocky.\
  \ I had to be careful. The higher I got the rain increased and the temperature dropped.\
  \ I passed one cow who looked at me funny and seemed content standing in a deep\
  \ thick mud. I passed one human not content. The trail teased with false summits.\
  \ My run was reduced to a walk and my body was becoming colder. The rain up here\
  \ turned to snow and began to blow sidewise. I covered up my face and kept moving,\
  \ the top was not far off.  I was in a cloud now, and this coupled with the snow\
  \ gave me almost zero visibility. But I could still hear. I heard a Caw. My eyes\
  \ followed the trail of sound to a crow as black as my toes might have become had\
  \ I stayed here too long. The crow hugged the side of the peak just before it dropped\
  \ off. Maybe the crow knew I couldn\u2019t see and was giving me a warning.  I took\
  \ a picture, ate an apple, sat, relaxed and turned around. \n\nIt\u2019s odd thinking\
  \ about this now knowing I didn\u2019t run away from anything. The edge on the mountain\
  \ wasn\u2019t really a \nmetaphor of my life. My only option was to turn back. I\
  \ would see and feel and experience everything I would have anyway. The only difference\
  \ was, I had done a sweet hike."
