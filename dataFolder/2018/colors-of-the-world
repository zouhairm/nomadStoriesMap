Text: "\u201CWhy do you speak English if you are not white?\u201D Rosa asked me in\
  \ Spanish.\nHer mother seated on her right side smiled with a bit of confusion.\
  \ I appreciate the openness of children.\nEvening was setting over Antigua Guatemala.\
  \ The surface of cobblestone paved streets now looked more even. Volcanos surrounding\
  \ the city were nearly invisible under a hat of thick clouds. \nOn the front steps\
  \ of the colonial style restaurant where Rosa and her mother had settled their merchandise,\
  \ our conversation was full-fledged. For her 9 years of age, I understood what she\
  \ really wanted to know: why I looked different than the tourists she had sold to\
  \ during her six months of street vendor career. \n I laughed softly thinking of\
  \ all the possible answers. That English was not actually my first language. That\
  \ Black people also speak English. That I emigrated from a different country to\
  \ where I reside now. That the world is filled with unique combinations of people,\
  \ colors and stories. I simply replied in my broken Spanish:\n\u201CI had to learn\
  \ English, just like I learned Spanish.\u201D\n\"I want to learn English too one\
  \ day, and speak it like the gringos\", Rosa convincingly affirmed. We laughed.\
  \ I assured her she can learn anything if she really wants. \n\u201CI can\u2019\
  t go to school now. I need to help my mother\u201D she defended. \nRosa like her\
  \ mother has never attended school. Childhood has escaped her; a profession was\
  \ already chosen. Street seller, as likely will become her five younger siblings.\
  \ \n\u201CThere are many strong children like you around the world who have to help\
  \ their parents.\u201D I offered as comfort. \u201CYou are still learning; only\
  \ in a different way\u201D I added. She nodded, acceptive of her fate.  \nCurious,\
  \ Rosa asked to touch my braids; I allowed her. \"I like them\", she said smiling.\
  \ With permission, I reached for her ribbons adorned tresses of silky dark hair\
  \ falling on her shoulders. We all laughed like we were exchanging energy. \nSweet\
  \ and spicy aroma filled the air forcing a conscious effort to keep my burning eyes\
  \ open while my mouth waters. An approaching Asian couple appeared interested in\
  \ Rosa\u2019s displayed merchandise.\nI tended a $10 bill for my $1 purchase, internally\
  \ promoting the feeling of supporting a family against encouraging child labor.\
  \ Rosa handed me an intricately weaved table runner she handcrafted herself. Some\
  \ would say it looked like a rainbow, others may suggest it looked more like a gay\
  \ flag. To me it had a lot of beautiful colors, just like the people of world."
