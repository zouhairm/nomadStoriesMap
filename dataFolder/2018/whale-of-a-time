Text: "I\u2019m staring up, suspended; it seems gravity here has no effect. The sun\
  \ appears from behind a silhouette as shimmering specks of aurora crystals radiate\
  \ from the sun\u2019s rays illuminating the nuances of the vast blue ocean encompassing\
  \ me.\n\nWe descend into the liquid blue and glide over to the towering rock of\
  \ Hin Bai, near Koh Pha Ngan in the Gulf of Thailand. It is our second dive of the\
  \ day whaleshark season is here, but so far I'm shit outta luck. Barracudas, smooth-tailed\
  \ trevally and queenfish swim in schools, in such unison it appears as if great\
  \ silver curtains, alive with magic, move slowly revealing the pinnacle, a grey\
  \ reef shark waiting in the blue vastness for unsuspecting prey as if guarding these\
  \ enchanting walls.\n\nBeyond the magic walls, colours soon begin to emanate from\
  \ the rock. The treasures of marine life appear splendid, overflowing with a colourful\
  \ medley of fishes: schooling long bat fish in zebra stripes and flippers as yellow\
  \ as a buttercup, a giant grouper hiding in the overhangs looks like one moody S.O.B.,\
  \ corals boast a scorpion fish, an elegant but venomous killer, nemos of tangerine\
  \ and cream, shrimps, crabs, and nudibranchs that a child would describe as real\
  \ life Pokemon. \n\nI swim out to the empty cerulean realm to take one last look\
  \ at the thriving rock. I watch as the other divers explore still, enchanted by\
  \ the underwater world, all but one - he was looking at me, he begins to signal\
  \ to me: an open hand, the thumb placed to the forehead all the fingers pointing\
  \ up, repeatedly tapping it against his forehead. I turn slowly. A distant shadow\
  \ appears. I stare with curiosity as the shadow grows. A white underbelly soon appears\
  \ with white spots hovering above. It glides effortlessly in my direction; as I\
  \ marvel at the magnificent creature, it steers towards me. I freeze. I know these\
  \ creatures are harmless unless provoked, but have I unknowingly provoked it, have\
  \ I angered it in some way? As it lingered before me, I see out of the corner of\
  \ my eye a smaller version of this giant. The mama whale is but a metre from my\
  \ face; when \u2018she\u2019 decides to come closer, only inches remain between\
  \ us. Our eyes meet, I let go of all my fearful thoughts, humbled before the grand\
  \ elegant being that she is. She gently nudges me down out of her way, swims over\
  \ me. I stare, suspended in amazement - for what seems like a lifetime. A final\
  \ flick of her tail whips me upright. As I witness her calf following her slowly,\
  \ both disappear into the abyss."
