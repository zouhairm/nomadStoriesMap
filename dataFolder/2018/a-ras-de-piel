Text: "Touching skin\n \nTwenty-seven years old and with my heart in a fist, in case\
  \ you and your power open the door.\nSome time ago, you came in silence but now\
  \ ,you left me only noise.\nWe were just broken glass and you start cracking my\
  \ skin.\nI sold my life in a pawnshop,only lefting a couple of books in that attic\
  \ of Chueca.\nMadrid closed his eyes when I could\u2019nt look at you, I felt like\
  \ a soul among the people, Alone in a big city.\nI bought a one-way ticket and ran\
  \ to Barajas. I wanted to see you at the controls of the T1, with a thousand excuses\
  \ to move to your back and return to the loop ... But I arrived in Prague, hardly\
  \ seen me in a mirror marred and with carmine marks, of other women who lost something\
  \ more that the smile here.\nYou opened every wound, laughing,doing \"honor\" to\
  \ the word man, you made that even hurt.\nI walked the streets of a thousand countries,\
  \ skimming the world. But every time I entered a room, I saw you in the same vertex\
  \ of my body, half dead and clothed.\nI still did\u2019nt turn on the light, lest\
  \ you leave because you are only a shadow.\nAnd everithing whas dark \nI looked\
  \ for you in other bodies, with people who went through all the scars you did me.\n\
  When they articulated your name ... I was afraid, I had a thousand birds on my head\
  \ ... that instead of flying they shouted, I hid them so long in your cage, they\
  \ forgot what the breeze was.\nToday, years later, when they returned to Madrid,\
  \ they broke the bars with the hatred you gave them.\nThey flutter up in the Metro\
  \ and make me fly high. Today, I am a free man."
