Text: "After mulling several possible destinations, we unanimously agreed that there\
  \ isn\u2019t a better place than the breathtaking Bali for three workaholic girls\
  \ to unwind on a modest budget. We knew we chose supreme as soon as we landed in\
  \ the Indonesian island which greeted us with its pristine beaches and soulful mountains.\
  \ The road to our resort in Ubud offered mesmerizing scenery of luscious green paddy\
  \ fields, magnificent stone-cut temples, and an immaculate sky shaded in blue, orange\
  \ and pink.\nAs we blended in the local folklore, the place began to feel like home.\
  \ The colorful array of petite handicraft shops, the traditional dance music, and\
  \ the inviting smiles of natives made for a memorable evening.\nAs dusk set in,\
  \ we started towards the Hard Rock Caf\xE9 to have our fix of live music and a good\
  \ brew. Like most tourists, we covered the considerable distance by walk. Closer\
  \ to the cafe, my eyes caught a sketchy outline of a needy and shabby man, sitting\
  \ by the footpath in rags. Without thinking much, I handed him my packet of cookies.\
  \ He looked at me with his kind and wrinkled eyes, hesitated at first, but accepted\
  \ it. \nThe live music at the Caf\xE9 was so good that we lost track of time. We\
  \ left around 1 am. As we searched the scarcely lit streets for taxis, my absent-minded\
  \ marrow led me to an alley while my friends went elsewhere. After several minutes\
  \ of a futile hunt, I realized I was lost in an unfamiliar island, at an odd hour,\
  \ with no knowledge of local language. Even worse, I gave my handbag to my friend\
  \ for safekeeping, so my cell phone and cash were astray! \nPanicking, I stood still\
  \ for a long time, sobbing. Then a shadow approached me, and I saw those kind eyes\
  \ again. It was the same homeless man! He didn\u2019t require much explanation from\
  \ me. He just understood my predicament by seeing how shaken I was. His next deed\
  \ has been forever engraved in my heart! \nHe practically emptied his pocket full\
  \ of coins into a plastic bag, offered it to me and conveyed through sign language\
  \ that the money would help me catch a taxi back to the hotel. Here is a man to\
  \ whom life has been cruel and yet he has been incredibly compassionate! I couldn\u2019\
  t take the money because I knew he\u2019d need it, but he didn\u2019t take no for\
  \ an answer and found me a taxi. I reached my hotel with a heavy heart and a strong\
  \ determination to find and reward him the following day. Much to my regret, I never\
  \ found him, but through his kind gesture, he taught me that humanity and karma\
  \ are bona fide."
