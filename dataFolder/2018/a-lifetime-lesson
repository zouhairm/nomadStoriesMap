Text: "In this story, I would like to tell you about a lesson in road trip toMangi-Tungi.\n\
  \nThe night before the ride was full of excitement, thinking how beautiful it will\
  \ be, how the roads and the scenic views will be.\nI woke up, the excitement was\
  \ at its peak.\nSo left the home, headed to the train station to pick up my friend(who\
  \ was with me as pillion throughout the journey).\n\nHere the journey starts with\
  \ a beautiful sunrise\n\nSo, after having snacks, suddenly we felt that we are getting\
  \ late. So from this moment we started to rush(because we had to reach to the destination\
  \ as early as possible),which affected our journey. we were not able to enjoy the\
  \ moments of the journey, the beauty of journey, to stop and embrace the beauty\
  \ of mother nature, but Yess we does stopped many times in between to capture the\
  \ photos, but it weren't that good because we were not enjoying it. \n\nSo after\
  \ a tiring 166 km we finally reached Mangi-Tungi at 1pm. As we arrived I saw that\
  \ to go on top of the hill, we need to do hiking(using steps). It was so tough after\
  \ doing such ride, it was a challenge for us, but somehow we gathered all the will\
  \ power we've got and started to climb, it took us two glasses of lemonade and lots\
  \ of body pain to reach the midway(which took us more than 45 min). As we reached\
  \ the mid way, there were many monkeys troubling people. People used to carry sticks\
  \ so that they can protect themselves from monkeys, but we were not having any stick\
  \ to protect us. So after few minutes we decided to return back to the ground.\n\
  \nIt was a big big disappointment that we could not go to the top. The view from\
  \ the top would've been something which we have never seen before. I still regret\
  \ that we didn't reach where we wanted to and all the hustle and bustle to reach\
  \ the destination and to return home early. We could've enjoyed a lot throughout\
  \ the journey, but we kept on the rush.\n\nSo, a very important lesson, which I\
  \ learned from this road trip is that : \u201C Never rush dreaming of the destination,\
  \ you will spoil the entire journey.\u201D\n\nSo this is also related to our lives,\
  \ we rush all the way to achieve our goals(destinations), thinking that we will\
  \ get that pleasure there. Sometimes we reach successfully and sometimes we fail\
  \ but, in all this hustle and bustle, we spoil the fun and the moments of life (journey).\n\
  \nHence the conclusion is, keep enjoying the journey and eventually you will reach\
  \ the destinations and definitely, whether you fail or succeed, it's all worth it."
