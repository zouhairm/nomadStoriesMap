Text: "Jackeline is 31 years old, she has 7 children. She married when she was 18\
  \ years old with her husband, Varsali, who has another woman with whom she has 9\
  \ more children. In Maasai tribes, husbands could have up to 10 different wives,\
  \ if women do not have children it is their fault, they are accused of not being\
  \ fertile. In a documentary I once saw a group of Maasai men singing and jumping,\
  \ as if it were a kind of dance. What is really that is a competition, the Maasai\
  \ who jumps higher is the one who gets the cheapest woman in the market. A woman\
  \ costs about 10 cows.\n\nJackeline gets up early, give bath to her children, takes\
  \ milk from the cows, makes breakfast, goes to look for water in the river, which\
  \ is 8 kilometers away, returns home, cooks again, makes jewelry to sell to tourists\
  \ and rebuild the house. The houses of the Maasai people are made of layers of clay\
  \ and every 2/3 days the women check if there are any cracks and rebuild their houses\
  \ if necessary. That is the routine of a Maasai woman, the man spends the day in\
  \ the local market buying or selling cattle.\nThe Maasai are a nomadic tribe, that\
  \ means that every two years the Maasai man leaves his home for one or two years.\
  \ During that time other Maasai rapes the women. Jackeline explained to me that\
  \ she does not define the act as \"rape\", she told me: \"it is not a rape as such,\
  \ it is an accepted thing among the Maasai women, they do not resist. They know\
  \ that when her husband leaves, others will come and force them to have sex with\
  \ them. \" \n\nDomestic violence is normal in Maasai tradition, the woman also told\
  \ me that it happens very often. \"The Maasai women have no right to raise their\
  \ voices, even to ask questions, my friend here next to me was beaten last week\
  \ for asking her husband why he had arrived so late that Tuesday,\" she explained.\
  \ Before leaving the Maasai village I asked the woman: what is your dream? Smiling,\
  \ she told me: now girls start going to school, I want my daughter to have a different\
  \ life than me.\n\nThat was an unexplainable moment, the fact that woman had opened\
  \ up to me in that conversation explaining me so intimate things was worth more\
  \ than all the crystalline waters that I enjoyed on that trip."
