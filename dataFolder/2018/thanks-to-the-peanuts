Text: "The plane sways above the ridges of Monserrat. A girl next to me is speaking\
  \ in thick Spanish, poking my leg, offering me peanuts. My eyes creak open, and\
  \ I reply in my Argentinian twang, palms open. Amidst a salty crunch a friendship\
  \ is formed.\nPaola is my age, looks like the stereotype of a Spanish woman, and\
  \ is fierce and demanding. By the time we are outside, she has made us plans for\
  \ the night.\n\u201CIt\u2019s carnival, Camila. You do not come to Barcelona during\
  \ carnival and stay inside to study, joder.\u201D\nThe air smells musky. It is cold\
  \ enough to turn skin to porcelain and crack it, but the sun is out and the light\
  \ is golden. The palm trees planted outside El Prat sway how I have always remembered\
  \ them to, whisked away by the breeze in the same way I feel myself being whisked\
  \ away. \nArm linked in mine, Paola has ushered me onto a bus, payed for my ticket,\
  \ and sat me in a cold, blue seat. \nFiercely, \u201CDrop off your bags. We are\
  \ going out.\u201D\nMy lips part with the intention of \u2018no\u2019, but I know\
  \ well the feeling of floating down Mediterranean pavements at 3am, of staying in\
  \ a place that will serve you hot food and icy beers until beyond midnight, of gazing\
  \ up at strange houses in a moonlight stupor, watching the silver light from the\
  \ sky drip onto the tiles like trinkets. So I nod, and to the voice that rises up\
  \ inside me to say, \u2018You should know better\u2019, I lift my finger to its\
  \ lips and tell it, \u2018There is no better.\u2019\nWe go to Paola\u2019s uncle\u2019\
  s bar. A place of smoke and crumbling brick. We are served endless beers without\
  \ our hands ever nearing our pockets, and Patatas Bravas so hot they ignite our\
  \ insides. Pressed into a table with strangers; the man and woman opposite wearing\
  \ yellow ribbons and talking over each other. \nDizzy from the noise, at 12:30 we\
  \ turn out onto the streets.\nThe fire in my heart has not reached my toes. A few\
  \ minutes later, icy Ramblas pavements sliding under numb feet, Paola nudges me.\n\
  \u201CMira.\u201D\nLooking up, my jaw drops down to my frosty feet. We are on Passeig\
  \ de Gr\xE0cia, in front of Gaud\xED\u2019s Casa Batll\xF3. A monument which undulates\
  \ in our vision, like a delicate bubble. It rises from the pavement like a magnificent\
  \ serpent. We gawp until the air around us threatens to turn to ice, and when we\
  \ turn away the house flashes behind my eyelids every time I blink.\nEarly hours.\
  \ The door to my rented apartment creaks as tiptoe I in and collapse onto the bed,\
  \ blue-lipped, grinning. I\u2019d told my host, \u201CI\u2019ll be in early every\
  \ night working.\u201D\nNot in Barcelona."
