Text: "From long time ago I had the dream of travelling to Paris. Yes, I wanted to\
  \ visit the Eiffel Tower, see the Mona Lisa. What tourists basically do. But besides\
  \ that conventional idea there was something else, something that was calling me.\
  \ I was sure that iconic city reserved a revelation just for me.\nIt was how we\
  \ decided that for my 15th birthday we would travel to that city full of stories\
  \ that changed the world.\nI was in my second year of secondary school, and in that\
  \ year I had a teacher who taught me a new way of seeing art.\nIt was her who, almost\
  \ finishing the school year, assigned each student a presentation about a particular\
  \ painting. I got a work of a painter I\u2019d never heard of; however, I liked\
  \ the title of the painting: \u201CThe Studio\u201D by Gustave Courbet.\nAll this\
  \ has a purpose; in the end it will make more sense, but for know I\u2019ll continue\
  \ with my trip.\nThe Paris sky greeted us cloudy. It rained almost all the time.\
  \ However, each structure had an imposing air, like someone who knows more because\
  \ they have lived and seen more things than you. Paris stood before me with its\
  \ grandeur.\nWhat I wanted to get at with this story happened on Tuesday.\nWhen\
  \ we started our journey, from the hotel, following the Seine.\nAt some point we\
  \ saw that they were offering a boat tour along the Seine, which made a stop at\
  \ the Muse\xE9 d\u2019Orsay, with the largest collection of impressionist works\
  \ in the world. We didn\u2019t hesitate to enter.\nThe first thing that caught my\
  \ attention was the clock. Such mechanism left me breathless, it is the masterpiece\
  \ of the place. But when I was able to take my eyes off it, I separated from the\
  \ group and decided to explore on my own. And the last the last thing I expected\
  \ was what I found when I entered one of the rooms.\nI immediately recognized the\
  \ painting. The Painter's Studio stood before me as if it had been waiting for me,\
  \ as if I was destined to find it. I\u2019d forgotten everything I said in the presentation:\
  \ its measurements, its technique, the meaning of each scene. The painting tripled\
  \ my height; it covered an entire wall, so those little things didn\u2019t seem\
  \ too important. In that moment I only thought that that was the place I had to\
  \ arrive, because the presentation left me with a teaching. I understood that many\
  \ times we don\u2019t give importance to the art, it seems like it doesn\u2019t\
  \ involve us. It\u2019s the opposite. We can always find in any of our trips the\
  \ work that will make us feel part of humanity, part of its history."
