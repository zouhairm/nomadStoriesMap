Text: "Valery looked tired, she was bored and her legs hurt. Her job forced her to\
  \ always sit at the desk working at the computer and Valery felt she was no longer\
  \ stimulating from her life. While she sipped her coffee sitting in a small bar\
  \ in Leamington Spa, she thought she should find a way to escape from that cage.\
  \ \"I need a survival strategy\", she thought. At that moment she was struck by\
  \ a vision that left her stunned. She saw a tall boy coming in, his hair brown and\
  \ curly, his beard and his deep gaze. It was he, it was Kostas. They had not seen\
  \ each other for two years, since he had returned to Greece for work. But they had\
  \ always loved each other.\n\"What are you doing here? I thought I would never see\
  \ you again ... \".\n\"I came here for you. I've come to tell you that I want you\
  \ to come with me and stay with me forever\u201D, said Kostas. Then he left, leaving\
  \ a plane ticket in her hands and endless doubts in her mind.\nValery loved that\
  \ man, but she knew she had to follow her instinct and concentrate on what she really\
  \ wanted to do in her life: writing. Her academic background casually led her to\
  \ work in an office that had restricted her creativity and enthusiasm. But in her\
  \ unconscious, during the last few years, she had continued to feed her curiosity\
  \ for the discovery of new places, unknown cultures and traditions. The thing she\
  \ most wanted in her life was to travel and tell people wonderful stories about\
  \ the world. Thus, the unexpected return of her love made her conscious about her\
  \ real priorities and she decided to leave, but not for Greece ... for the world.\
  \ The next day she resigned and finally felt free to be herself. She did not have\
  \ a precise destination, she did not even have much money, but she was exhilarated\
  \ and, from her point of view, it was enough. Finally she could do anything and\
  \ first of all she bought a ticket to Morocco. She had always wanted to go there!\
  \ She prepared the suitcase, the camera and her notebook on which she would write\
  \ down whatever she thought worthy of being told. As soon as she arrived in Marrakesh\
  \ she immediately noticed the bright colors of the market, the smell of aromatic\
  \ spices and the creativity of local architecture. She listened to a group of people\
  \ playing the darbuka and not far from there she noticed some girls who were jumping\
  \ and dancing. One of these, very young, looked at her with a penetrating gaze and\
  \ gave her a smile. Everything seemed wonderful. Valery was finally alive and free\
  \ to tell it to the world."
