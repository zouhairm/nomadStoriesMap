Text: "Hanoi, 9th Dec\n\nI walked into a small shop with beautiful dresses, some made\
  \ of silk, and asked the lady if I could try two of them. I loved the patterns and\
  \ the design and as I was trying them on, they looked nice to me. One was a bit\
  \ too tight in my hip and the other a bit too short for my taste. The lady said\
  \ it was ok, she could fix the hip on the first, for me, and as for the other one,\
  \ she could make me another one, with the same fabric and model but 10cm longer.\
  \ I open my mouth to say I would only be in Hanoi for 5 more days, and maybe it\
  \ would not be enough time, but she interrupted me to say that it would be ready\
  \ tomorrow at 6. I was confused,.. maybe my english (as a second language) and her\
  \ english (as a second language) weren't enough and something got lost in translation,\
  \ so I asked, Tomorrow? Are you sure? I can wait a few more days, I am not in THAT\
  \ much rush. She said not to worry, it would be ready tomorrow. Ok, I said, but\
  \ don't spend the night working, I am not that much in a hurry... We agreed on a\
  \ price and I left.\n\nNext day, around 4 o\xB4clock while strolling around the\
  \ old quarter, I passed by the taylor shop. I thought it wouldn't be ready, but\
  \ as I was passing by... I found her sleeping, leaning on her sewing machine, right\
  \ there, in the light of day, with the open shop, with my dress on her lap... I\
  \ felt like life can be so diferent for so many other people, so important... Those\
  \ dresses for me were a whim, taylored to perfection that will cost less than something\
  \ from H&M, but for that women, they were the pride of a job well done, to please\
  \ a client the quickest, better way possible, even when I specifically asked for\
  \ her, not too spend a sleepless night, over me. I left her to sleep, will come\
  \ back later, I thought... There is no way I am going to make her feel ashamed of\
  \ me finding her a sleep, or for not finishing her work.\n\nIt's 6.30, the time\
  \ I settled with the little taylor. Here I go. She opens a smile when she sees me\
  \ coming in... Hello! I say, How are you today? Very well, she responds, and I have\
  \ your dresses ready for you! Do you want to try them on? They fit like a glove,\
  \ she did not take my measurements previously, she measured only with her eyes...\
  \ The truth is that they look beautiful and she says they look nice on me too...\
  \ And they really do... the smile on her face is incredible... I say thank you,\
  \ pay and walk out. Better spent money in a very very long time..."
