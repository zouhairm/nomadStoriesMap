Text: "Back in 2014, I walked into a martial arts gym for a trial class of Brazillian\
  \ jiu jistu(bjj). Little did i know that first step i made would change my life\
  \ forever. Fast forward to 2017, i quit my job and decided to travel and train bjj\
  \ across the globe. \n\nDuring the trip, one of my most memorable experiences was\
  \ at Vsetin, a relatively quiet town in Czech Republic. Before arriving, i wrote\
  \ to my host Mr Jan who was the head coach for a bjj gym there. Upon arrival, Jan\
  \ greeted me and told me to get ready as we headed straight to the gym for training.\
  \ The gym was very beautiful and all his students were happy to welcome me there\
  \ although i was a complete stranger. It was amazing how i just met all these people\
  \ and few minutes later everyone was trying to strangle me. \n\nThe next day was\
  \ easter sunday, so Jan invited me to join in along with his friends. In asian countries\
  \ we do not celebrate easter so it was my first time going to an easter celebration.\
  \ As his friends arrived at his place, they brought along little branches which\
  \ they call poml\xE1zka and hit the women gently with it. Jan explained to me it\
  \ was a Czech easter tradition to ensure health of the women. \n\nAfter that, we\
  \ went to a house which belonged to Jan's childhood friend. Jan explained to his\
  \ friends that i was a traveller staying at his place. They welcomed me and told\
  \ me to eat as much as possible! There was plenty of homemade food and alcohol on\
  \ the table. It really reminded me of chinese new year festival back in Malaysia.\
  \ For the next couple of hours, everyone was having a fun time laughing and talking\
  \ to each other. While i did not understand their language, i could see from their\
  \ faces that everyone was very happy and enjoying themselves. Jan told me that it\
  \ was mostly their childhood memories that they were reminiscing about as they all\
  \ grew up together. As for me,i was having such a great time enjoying the good food\
  \ and doing shots with them. Before leaving, they even requested for me to sing\
  \ a song in my language so i sang a chinese song for them.\n\nAs of writing this,\
  \ i have finished my journey around the world. Looking back at my journey i cannot\
  \ remember every famous sight that i have been to. However, Vsetin will forever\
  \ have a place in my heart as Jan,his friends and his students made me feel so welcome\
  \ at home. It is amazing how a martial art can bring everyone together regardless\
  \ of nationality, skin colour and status. Regardless of everything, everyone is\
  \ equal on the mats."
