Text: "\u201CTava, you\u2019re going to regret it if you don\u2019t get this picture.\u201D\
  \n\nTowering over 3,000 ft above the Yosemite valley below I didn\u2019t think so.\
  \ I shook my head at my friend. \u201CI can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m afraid of heights,\
  \ and I could fall.\u201D \n\nMy friend rolled his eyes. Why didn\u2019t he understand?\
  \ I could see the headline rising before my tired eyes, \u2018Girl falls to her\
  \ death at Glacier Point attempting to take cool photograph\u2019. I did not want\
  \ to fall into the category of those irresponsible tourists who step backward off\
  \ of cliffs trying to take a \u201Cselfie\u201D.\n\nGustavo shrugged and walked\
  \ off to get pictures of Half Dome as the sun began to peek over the horizon. It\
  \ was just after 5:30 AM, cold with a light mist hanging in the air. I could feel\
  \ the damp clinging to me. I had not brushed my teeth in almost 24 hours, the last\
  \ shower I had was four days ago, and I still had sand in my boots from Oregon.\
  \ Despite all of these things I was inspired. I loved waking up not knowing where\
  \ that day would take me. So why wasn\u2019t I willing to take that picture? After\
  \ a few minutes trying to come up with excuses I realized I didn\u2019t have any.\
  \ Before this trip, I promised myself I would take more risks, do what I love, be\
  \ who I wanted to be. My whole life I had followed a set path and had a plan, but\
  \ when I finished school I felt lost. I knew that to figure out what I needed I\
  \ had to see and do things. Above all, I wanted to get to know myself, who I was\
  \ as a person and who I was prepared to be to get the things that I wanted out of\
  \ life. \n\nI looked at the edge of that cliff and my heart fluttered. I was terrified,\
  \ but so what? Sitting, and hugging my knees to my chest I had my answer. I was\
  \ going to do it. \n\nI climbed up and stood atop the slab of granite. I felt dizzy,\
  \ the feeling that I was about to fall engulfed me. My vision narrowed, my palms\
  \ started to sweat, and my limbs felt like jello. I walked maybe three more steps\
  \ before I sank to my knees and started the slow, inevitable crawl to the edge.\
  \ I peered over at the sheer drop below me and my mind grew quiet. I thought of\
  \ nothing as I swung my legs over the edge, and kept one hand firmly behind me for\
  \ balance. I looked ahead and waited. A feeling of awe enveloped me. The wind whipped\
  \ my hair away from my face and I felt like I could finally see. I knew the picture\
  \ had already been taken, but I stayed there on the edge still and quiet reveling\
  \ in the joy I felt at being on top of the world!"
