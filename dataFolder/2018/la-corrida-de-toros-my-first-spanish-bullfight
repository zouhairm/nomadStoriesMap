Text: "Vaya Toro! The phrase repeats until the bull launches in vain at the matador\
  \ standing tall in the middle of Plaza de Toro. Cheers reverberate through my body,\
  \ exciting me to join in the centuries old Spanish tradition. At the balcony's edge\
  \ stands a woman, pink from the flowery comb on her head to the frilly bottom of\
  \ her dress. I feel awkward in my t-shirt and shorts for what is considered La Fiesta\
  \ Nacional.\n\nBut no one is as ornately dressed as the matador in his suit of lights.\
  \ The name alone makes my whole wardrobe seem mediocre.\n\nThe matador entices the\
  \ bull again with a swirl of the magenta cape. He leans over with his free arm and\
  \ hugs the bull. It is so much more intense in person than on TV. I can see why\
  \ many Spaniards support the stylistic art that is bullfighting. Unblinkingly, I\
  \ watch the challengers stand face-to-face. I hardly notice my knees fall into the\
  \ next row as the matador falls onto his. Hand on horn, man to beast, they pause.\
  \ Then slowly stretching both arms behind, the matador places his forehead on the\
  \ bull\u2019s.\n\nA false bond.\n\nRising, the bullfighter struts away. He produces\
  \ something fluffy and sharp. Approaching the bull, the matador aims, gracefully\
  \ leaps to the side, breaks skin with the white banderilla, and I feel warm liquid\
  \ pour down my arm.\n\nI whip around to see a man turning an open wineskin upright.\
  \ Baked bitter wine assaults my nostrils.\n\nI return my attention to the bull.\
  \ There are now several banderillas blanketing his back. Even from this distance\
  \ I can see they are stained red. The bull shakes his head in protest. No longer\
  \ provoked by the matador\u2019s swift motions, he walks to the edge of the arena\
  \ and lies down. Hot iron blood stains the sandy dirt floor. Ripples of dust scatter\
  \ with every contraction of the ribs. The cries increase at the matador posing with\
  \ a long sword. Confused by the echoing claps, the bull\u2019s heavy eyes search\
  \ the audience.\n\nHe does not understand that his pain is their entertainment.\n\
  \nThe matador faces the bull. The crowd will be angry if the final stab does not\
  \ pierce the heart, an instant kill. I've seen the process on TV but am unprepared\
  \ for the real life emotion. I can see why bullfighting is banned in other regions.\
  \ I hardly notice my knees fall into the next row as the bull is forced up from\
  \ his. Horn on hand, bull to beast, they pause. Then a fluid plunge above the neck.\
  \ The body stiffens, legs jerk straight out, and he drops.\n\nWatch, wince and repeat.\n\
  \nFive more bulls will die today."
