Text: "As the rain fell, I too fell, from the notion that life is a product of control.\
  \ Rather, it is a dance of co-creation, invariably uncertain, yet beautifully so;\
  \ as the rain fell, I became anew. \n\nDown from the clouds and the lush green jungles\
  \ of Monteverde I travelled onwards, finding myself drawn to the colourful Caribbean\
  \ coast of Puerto Viejo de Talamanca. It was in this small town draped in Rastafarian\
  \ culture, where time crept slowly like a jaguar stalking it's prey, did I realize\
  \ the sheer insignificance of my long held desires. From schedules and to-do lists,\
  \ productivity goals that ran my life, it dawned on me that none of it truly mattered\
  \ if it didn't make my heart beat faster.\n\nI could describe to you the perennial\
  \ scent of the rich Costa Rican coffee, a sweetness hiding in its undertones, or\
  \ the way the ocean breeze kissed my skin, imparting a certain sense of calmness\
  \ and tranquility, but it is it's inhabitants that truly make this town come to\
  \ life. Never once was I met unkindly, but always greeted with a hearty smile, a\
  \ hug and a kiss on the cheek. \"Pura vida!\" they'd say, with deeper meaning than\
  \ just words could describe. It's a lifestyle, and one that they are intensely passionate\
  \ about. There's an intimacy that paces through the streets, travelling with you\
  \ around every beach and into every bar, one that feels ever so endearing, willingly\
  \ accepting all that you are. Just like a long lasting embrace, the sincerity of\
  \ the locals transcended any assumptions I had previously held about what it meant\
  \ to be alive. It is a place where time has less meaning, every moment is best lived,\
  \ and it is clearly recognizable in every face. With luminous eyes, crow's feet\
  \ adorning their youthful expressions and loving dispositions, the people in this\
  \ small paradise have not forgotten the meanings of joy and play. Being there, it\
  \ is no surprise that Costa Rica has been named one of the happiest places on earth.\
  \ \n\nA quote comes to mind, written on a wall just outside of the quaint, bohemian\
  \ styled Como en mi Casa Art Caf\xE9 reading, \"the most beautiful things arise\
  \ by chance...\"\nAnd it was precisely by chance that I got caught in the rain while\
  \ bike riding through the brightly coloured streets of Puerto Viejo. As one who\
  \ usually avoids rain, it caught me by surprise just how extraordinary it felt to\
  \ have the cool showers cascading down my face, Bob Marley could be heard playing\
  \ through speakers nearby, biking through the streets, all I could do was smile."
