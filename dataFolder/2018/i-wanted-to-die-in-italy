Text: "It was around dusk when it became clear that Mary wasn\u2019t coming back.\
  \ At the secluded bed and breakfast in the hills above Cinque Terre in northwest\
  \ Italy where I worked, all the days were the same. Now the usual languorous dinner\
  \ was cut short and a search party was forming in the village. The dinner wine sat\
  \ open but untouched on the terrace. \n\nMary was an American guest in her mid fifties\
  \ on something of a farewell tour through Italy with her new husband and teenage\
  \ son, Liam. They had moved to Rome the year before but her husband couldn\u2019\
  t stand the winters and they were headed back to Phoenix, Arizona. The tension between\
  \ them was palpable. \"I wanted to die in Italy,\" she had told me that morning,\
  \ before setting off alone on a hike to a secret beach in the valley. \n\nTwo and\
  \ a half million people visit the five seaside villages that make up Cinque Terre\
  \ each year. This is desktop-background Italy, where brightly colored houses dangle\
  \ impossibly from the cliff sides over vivid azure water. The air smells like wisteria.\
  \ Everything is casually a few hundred years old. \n\nFor many people, coming to\
  \ Italy is a lifelong dream. They talk about it as though it were a mythical place\
  \ locked away from time. When I picked wild herbs in the woods for dinner, or fell\
  \ asleep under the purple wisteria tree in the yard or swam at the secret beach\
  \ Mary had attempted to reach, I felt the same. A kind of romance was possible in\
  \ Cinque Terre that didn\u2019t exist over the hills, in the real and modern Italy.\
  \ \n\nNo one fought with their new husbands in paradise. No one went missing in\
  \ a village of 150 people. No one died here. But now it was well past midnight,\
  \ and the search party was beginning to utter that unthinkable word. \n\nAt 3:30\
  \ in the morning, I heard yelling \u201Cl\u2019abbiamo travata\u201D - we found\
  \ her. \n\nAround six, I sat with Mary\u2019s son and watched a helicopter finally\
  \ lift his mother out of the valley. The spell of timelessness was broken. A modern\
  \ machine had come and picked a broken tourist out of the woods. She would live,\
  \ but now she would spend months alone and in pain in the country she had thought\
  \ was her personal heaven. I brought Liam a small glass of the forgotten wine hoping\
  \ it would help him sleep. \n\nI couldn't imagine how he felt about Cinque Terre\
  \ right now- a hollow tourist trap that had swallowed his idealistic mother whole.\
  \ He looked exhausted and angry, but when he opened his mouth the only words he\
  \ said were \u201CIt\u2019s so beautiful here.\u201D"
