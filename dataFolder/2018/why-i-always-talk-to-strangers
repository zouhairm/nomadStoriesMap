Text: "If you really want to experience Thailand you need to get on a motorbike and\
  \ take the roads less traveled. Why? Well, for one you\u2019re less likely to crash\
  \ into someone or something. Road rules aren't taken too seriously in Thailand.\
  \ More importantly, you'll get an authentic feel of Thai life, and discover a world\
  \ of adventure.\n\n\u201CCan you\u2026 show me how to drive this?\u201D I asked\
  \ the shopkeeper timidly as I took the keys to the bike. He gave me a knowing look\
  \ and gestured for me to hop on with him, and took me to a little dirt field right\
  \ outside of town to show me the basics. \u201CThis? Break. This? Go.\u201D He didn\u2019\
  t speak much English, but it was enough to get me going.  I secured the clunky helmet,\
  \ gave him a smiling thumbs up and hit the road into the mountains of Pai.  \n\n\
  I took a turn on a narrow mountain road to avoid traffic. My eyes were torn off\
  \ the road by the sublime emerald mountainside, so I pulled over to take a photo.\
  \ I was startled when someone called out, \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D I thought\
  \ I was alone, but as I turned to the voice I saw an old man is smiling from behind\
  \ a rickety bamboo fence. \"Wherever this motorbike takes me,\" I responded. He\
  \ invited me in for coffee, and I hesitated for a moment. This is the point where\
  \ my story could go two ways. 1: I could have a lovely time, connecting with a local\
  \ Thai. OR 2: I could be walking into a sketchy murder situation. His gap-toothed\
  \ smile was welcoming, and I sensed a goodness to him, so I walked through the gate.\n\
  \nHis little garden hosted a shabby shack he had thatched together himself. He excitedly\
  \ took me on a tour of the yard, pointing out everything he had grown. \u201CSee?\
  \ Avocado!\u201D He started telling me about his life as he heated up water in an\
  \ electric kettle for coffee. He moved from Bangkok because he found it \u201Ctoo\
  \ confusing\u201D, and he used to be in the airforce. He was laughing constantly;\
  \ every sentence was followed by his warming chuckle.\n\nI sat on an old car bench\
  \ he had in the living room of his open hut and sipped the instant brew as he showed\
  \ me photos of his family. The place was a mess, but he told me he would clean it\
  \ up soon. \"Come back, bring your girlfriend or boyfriend, anytime! We can practice\
  \ English!\"  I think I\u2019m in love with this old man. Is it appropriate to adopt\
  \ a Thai grandfather? \n\nI finished the coffee and bid him farewell. We were together\
  \ for less than an hour, but the connection we made stays with me today. Talk to\
  \ strangers: you just might fall in love."
