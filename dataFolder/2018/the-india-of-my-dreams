Text: "The plan is to spend a couple of nights in Manali, perform a last-minute check-up\
  \ on the bikes and then drive to the mountains. Instead, we end up spending several\
  \ days in Manali fixing various Enfield-related problems, while it rains heavily\
  \ and the road toward Leh remains closed due to a landslide. What follows is five\
  \ days of watching TV, fighting over the remote control, ordering food from room\
  \ service and sitting on the balcony taking photos of the mountains that are now\
  \ covered in fog. When the bike is finally ready, the mountain rain has made my\
  \ boyfriend sick, and I am throwing up again. We spend a few more days in our bedroom.\n\
  \nIn The Bend, Go Slow Friend\nEventually the rain stops, the landslide is cleared\
  \ away and we start the 70-odd mile drive toward Keylong, our first overnight stop.\
  \ The road toward our first mountain pass, Rohtang La (13,050 feet and translated\
  \ as \u201Ca pile of dead bodies\u201D), is busy with Indian holidaymakers on their\
  \ way to the pass to see snow. It is a narrow and bumpy road, sometimes covered\
  \ in mud, sometimes ice cold mountain streams. Both the driver and the Enfield are\
  \ working hard, while I admire the surroundings: bright green meadows covered with\
  \ tiny yellow flowers, wild horses, dark forests and waterfalls, all surrounded\
  \ by high mountains."
