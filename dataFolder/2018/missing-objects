Text: "North Manitou Island stretches 8 miles long and 4 miles wide over the ocean\
  \ of freshwater named Lake Michigan. This was the destination for my first backpacking\
  \ experience, where I anxiously awaited the thrill of roughing it in the backcountry.\
  \ I had my shiny new toys strapped to my pack, and with an open mind my feet sunk\
  \ easily into the island. I anticipated the hours of sweat and thigh burning pain\
  \ my adventure would bring. I, along with my company, were prepared for an average\
  \ trek through Michigan oaks and slug infested trails.\nWith great promise, all\
  \ of these physical expectations were met. However, on our first night, we faced\
  \ a dilemma. My brother had forgotten to pack a shovel to properly dispose of waste.\
  \ A grossly unfortunate situation, yet to our surprise, not one hour would pass\
  \ before we stumbled upon a lost shovel just off our path. It was exactly what we\
  \ were missing. The chances of this coincidence were slim to none, so we embraced\
  \ it.\nAfter this ironic treasure was found, we collected any items that had been\
  \ lost to the island: including a single tent stake.\nWe didn\u2019t need it; our\
  \ tents were packed safely on our backs since the ferry dropped us. But 5 hours\
  \ later, as we threw our nylon on the grass, we realized we lacked just one tent\
  \ stake. Since the island had previously gifted us with one spare, we slept with\
  \ all four corners of our shelter secure. It was an omen hidden among rookie mistakes.\n\
  The following evening, the island gifted us with something else we never anticipated.\
  \ We sat knee to knee, surrounded by sand castles we built, and laughed with joy\
  \ previously unfound at home. We spoke conversations with one another until the\
  \ moon settled on the waters in front of us. There was a connection created that\
  \ night that was strictly inspired by the island. It had formed a new level of connection\
  \ between all of us.\nThe actual surprise came with the realization that this was\
  \ not just a hiking trip. It was an opportunity to relate with human beings outside\
  \ of our natural environment. We created relationships with each other that we never\
  \ even knew we lacked. And the circumstance of the island just so happened to be\
  \ the world\u2019s best backdrop. Until then we always assumed traveling had everything\
  \ to do with the destination. We underestimated its ability to gift us something\
  \ aside from physical skills, like a spiritual connection.\nYet, as it proved time\
  \ and time again, the island knew what we were missing and provided it."
