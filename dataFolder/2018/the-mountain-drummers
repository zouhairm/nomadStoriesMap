Text: "The sun had begun to set on Day 1 of Splashy Fen Music Festival, the warmth\
  \ of an Autumn afternoon giving way to a chilly evening breeze. South Africa\u2019\
  s longest running outdoor music festival was hosted on a trout farm cradled within\
  \ the Drakensberg Mountain range in the province of KwaZulu-Natal, flat-topped through\
  \ ancient basaltic lava flows and covered in a thin layer of snow. The border with\
  \ Lesotho was visible in the distance as we looked towards the sunset. The zipline\
  \ crossing the Mzimkhulu River had stopped operating as festival-goers vacated the\
  \ waters carrying river tubes and other floatation devices back to their camp tents.\
  \ \n\nNevashan and I headed back to our tent to change into warmer clothing for\
  \ the night. While returning to the main festival area we noticed a large bonfire\
  \ in an open field, people slowly gathering around with a variety of drums. A man\
  \ in a gypsy hat introduced an African rhythm on a djembe, and the others followed.\
  \ The music grew stronger, louder and more unified as everyone took turns to lead\
  \ the rhythms. The number of drummers slowly increased through the night until over\
  \ a hundred people were connected together in a trance-like state by the sounds\
  \ they were creating. \n\n\u201CI want to join,\u201D Nevashan decided after watching\
  \ for some time, mesmerised. He walked away and returned a short while later with\
  \ a big, black tog bag slung over his shoulder. He found a place in the circle and\
  \ sat cross-legged on the ground as he pulled out two drums from his bag and placed\
  \ them before him \u2013 a set of Indian tablas. Intrigued gazes were upon him as\
  \ he carefully started to mimic the African rhythms. \n\nSome of the drummers stopped\
  \ to listen. Gradually a group of people surrounded Nevashan to watch him play,\
  \ attentive to the \u2018taka dimi taka joonu\u2019 rhythm characteristic of South\
  \ Indian music. The others began following his lead, completely transforming the\
  \ style of the drumming. A renewed energy permeated the group as the different musical\
  \ styles merged into one. The moment was a perfect symbol of the cultural blend\
  \ of the region, within the natural amphitheatre of the mountain. \n\nEventually\
  \ we left the warmth of the drum circle to attend a performance at the main stage.\
  \ A farewell greeting of \u201CNamaste!\u201D followed us as we turned into the\
  \ darkness that would lead back to the crowds. After listening to some fiery blues\
  \ guitar, we retired for the night and fell asleep to the distant drumbeat that\
  \ continued into the early hours of the morning."
