Text: "Sitting in the train seat, singing with my dear friend Vickey \u201CCae el\
  \ Sol en t\xFA balc\xF3n\u201D I suddenly spot this guy sitting next to us, on the\
  \ train. When did he get on the train? How long has this guy been listening to my\
  \ dreadful singing? I only sing when I\u2019m delighted and tipsy, so I believe\
  \ no one knows how bad my voice is. This is bad; this Argentinean boy is handsome\
  \ \u2013 Lindo! \n\nI start smiling at him because I can, and I want too, and he\
  \ just touched all of my senses. I start thinking about how I should make my next\
  \ move! I need to talk this beautiful boy, with sparkling brown eyes and an AC/DC\
  \ rock t-shirt, melting smile, and a guitar next to him. Control yourself, figure\
  \ this out, and then make a move.\n\n\nEntering over to the Argentinean boy's side\
  \ and in dreadful Spanish, I ask him, \u201CWhere is the Palermo station?\u201D\
  \ He answers, \u201Cit is five more stops, and I'm going there as well, I will help\
  \ you.\u201D Of course, he said that in perfect Castellano. I was in love already,\
  \ even though I only understood 20 percent of what he was saying. Then I asked,\
  \ \u201CWhat is your name\u201D and he answered, \u201CMy names is Enrique.\u201D\
  \ I then made the worst joke ever, \u201Clike Enrique Iglesias?\u201D That was dreadful;\
  \ he even laughed because it was that awful, and it was an awkward moment. \n\n\
  We kept on looking at each other\u2019s eyes and smiling, then he said \u201CCan\
  \ I please get your number?\u201D and I said \u201CDale \u2013 Okay, you can\u201D\
  \ I gave him my number as this adventurous girl I am. Everyone that can improve\
  \ my Spanish can get my number. \n\nPalermo Station, we walked off the train together.\
  \ He says \u201CWhere are you going?\u201D and then \u201CWe are going to Kentucky\
  \ Pizza for Breakfast\u201D what else do you do 07:00 in the morning after a long\
  \ party!  Enrique \u201C I am going there as well.\u201D Perfect come along so I\
  \ can keep on looking into your deep brown eyes and understand more or less nothing\
  \ of your beautiful Castellano Spanish. Who needs to speak, when the energy is in\
  \ the air? \n\nAfter seven weeks together with sensational love and beautiful butterfly\
  \ moments, it was time to say goodbye. Little did I know, that I got misty eyes\
  \ as they said farewell with my Argentinean boy. I guess this is what happens when\
  \ your mum tells you to not fall in love with an Argentinean and then you end up\
  \ doing it. I was caught by surprise. I don\u2019t fall in love easily; maybe that\
  \ was my safety blanket. I did not know about the fact that it could become an actuality."
