Text: "As any traveller knows, local knowledge heightens any experience. For me, a\
  \ mark on my map led to places I could only dream of.\n\nAt 18, embarking on a journey\
  \ to the other side of the globe with little travel experience was terrifying. I\
  \ had left the familiarities of home in Australia and headed for Switzerland. A\
  \ strange place full of cheese enthusiasts and yodellers. I was quick however to\
  \ learn that was not the case.\n\nI had organised to stay with my uncle Brendan\
  \ for the first few days, who was a Swiss local. He showed me around Zurich where\
  \ I struggled to battle the onsets of jetlag. My eyes weighed more then the circle\
  \ of cheese I was to melt for dinner and I was falling asleep almost everywhere.\
  \ \n\nAfter spending my days sleeping in Zurich it was time to continue. Brendan\
  \ had told me about a place called Lenzerheide and given me the phone number of\
  \ an old friend to call when I arrive.\n\nLenzerheide possessed natural beauty,\
  \ the likes of which the world has rarely seen. V-Shape valleys ran off into the\
  \ horizon. Postcard like log cottages lined the streets at the base of a towering\
  \ mountain and a fresh, fluffy blanket of snow covered it all. \n\nUpon arrival\
  \ I called Brendan\u2019s friend Swanny and met him at the top of the mountain at\
  \ Piz Scalotta. An old wooden restaurant he owned situated at the peak staring down\
  \ into the slumbering depths of the Lenzerheide valley. \n\nI happened to arrive\
  \ on the opening day of the restaurant and Swanny presented me the opportunity to\
  \ work and live at Piz Scalotta. As accommodation of this kind would cost unfathomable\
  \ amounts I immediately said yes. \n\nFor a week and a half, I lived like a king.\
  \ Making first tracks every morning, watching the valley glow orange as the sun\
  \ rose and slipped away. Drank beer in a hot tub overlooking snow capped peaks and\
  \ talked story with local Swiss snowboarders. As light faded away an eerie silence\
  \ came to rest and it was truly humbling. \n\nAfter Lenzerheide I headed for Davos,\
  \ linked up with another one of Brendan\u2019s friends who gave me a room for a\
  \ week. His name was Sjarel Boons, an ex-professional sky diver and the first person\
  \ to ever film someone jump out and fly back into a plane. He has survived two sky\
  \ diving crashes and an 800-meter vertical cliff drop from an avalanche. \n\nAll\
  \ it took was one local connection and I was able to thrive in a foreign country,\
  \ meet incredible locals and experience places you dream about for free."
