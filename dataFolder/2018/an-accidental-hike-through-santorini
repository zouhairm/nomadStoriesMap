Text: "\u201CNo licence, no scooter,\u201D said a gruff voice behind the counter as\
  \ I searched through my bag for a second time. Knowing that I had forgotten to pack\
  \ it and wishing that it would somehow miraculously appear. It didn\u2019t.\n\n\u201C\
  Where you want to go?\u201D He asked.\n \n\"To the beach,\" replied my friend.\n\
  \n\u201CNo, no, no- you don\u2019t need scooter. You walk that way. 15 minutes.\u201D\
  \n\nHalf an hour later, there was still no sign of the beach.\n\nEarlier that day\
  \ in an orange capsule serving as a water taxi, I mentally checked my necessities.\
  \ Sunscreen? Check. Bathing-suit? Check. And just as I had completed the towel check,\
  \ the sheer height of the Santorini cliffs jutted out over my thoughts. How was\
  \ I going to reach the top?\n\nI met up with some friends in a tavern in the old\
  \ harbour- deciding that liquid courage might be the way forward. I am acutely afraid\
  \ of heights.\n  \nTaking the 580 stairs to the top of Fira was out of the question-\
  \ groups of tourists tried and failed to side- step the donkeys and their droppings.\n\
  \ \nI watched donkey after donkey being saddled with human cargo- their loads, more\
  \ often than not, very heavy. Some seemed happy to climb the steep stone steps,\
  \ whilst others needed a bit more prodding. I felt sorry for the poor Asses, and\
  \ decided on the treacherous looking cable car. I paid for my untouched ale and\
  \ left.\n\nThree minutes later as if on the legs of a newborn calf, I emerged from\
  \ the pod into breathing photograph. Luminous white and soothing blue: Santorini\
  \ straight out of a luxury brochure. The last thing I expected was the atmosphere.\
  \ Laughter erupted into alleyways from overhead bars playing traditional and modern\
  \ music. The scent of seafood wafted through narrow streets. People were happy...\
  \ \n\nWe traversed long, winding roads and dodged speeding cars. The pleasant scenes\
  \ I had only just witnessed flickered out of my mind- and in its place a vision\
  \ of my ship sailing away as we watched from the shore. We were about to give up\
  \ and turn back, but just like the movies, we heard the unmistakable rumbling of\
  \ waves.\n \nBlistered feet, sunburnt arms and well over an hour later, we were\
  \ at the beach- a black sand oasis. Too tired and sun-drenched to swim, we found\
  \ a bar with some shade, ordered ice cold drinks, and prepared ourselves for the\
  \ journey back...\n\nReturning, we actually had the time to look around and see\
  \ the beauty we probably would have missed whizzing by on a scooter.\n \nWould I\
  \ hike through Santorini again? Definitely...but not in flip flops."
