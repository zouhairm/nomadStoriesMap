Text: "To avoid enduring the torture of mile-long queues, Sara and I woke up before\
  \ sunrise and we entered the mausoleum accompanied by the first rays of light. \
  \ It was just ten in the morning when we exited the Taj Mahal. We were so entranced\
  \ that we could hardly speak. It was only the third day of our three-week backpacking\
  \ trip around India and we wondered if we had already reached the apotheosis of\
  \ our journey. Right there, in the middle of an unpaved street of Agra, India surprised\
  \ us yet again. As everything in this country it came unexpectedly and it hit us\
  \ hard. The freezing rain started to pour down furiously.\nWe took shelter under\
  \ a semi-destroyed balcony and we waited for the storm to pass. But instead of letting\
  \ up it became even heavier. And we were the most privileged spectators of a splendorous\
  \ snapshot of this unique country. A biker pulled a wheelie and took a selfie. An\
  \ old woman talked softly to a cow as they walked slowly together. A man left his\
  \ house, took off his jeans and started to wash them.  A group of schoolgirls dropped\
  \ their book bags and they started to play in the puddles. And every single one\
  \ of them did it with an immense smile on their faces. It was a kind of smile that\
  \ we had not seen before. We were not familiar with those gorgeous wrinkles around\
  \ the mouth and eyes. Then we understood which kind of grin we were witnessing.\
  \ It was a smile of peace and communion with the forces of nature and with everything\
  \ that surrounded them. We had never smiled like that before. There we were, a young\
  \ western couple taking shelter from a real experience under some wobbly planks.\
  \ All our repression and fears were dry and safe as the genuine life was pouring\
  \ down before our eyes.\nIn that moment I asked myself if pulling Sara under the\
  \ rain would be too corny. Then she held my hand. We looked at each other and smiled.\
  \ I saw those beautiful new wrinkles for the first time on her face.  We run to\
  \ the middle of the street and we got soaking wet in a millisecond. We started to\
  \ jump, play and laugh with the little girls. Feeling the taste of the rain on Sara\u2019\
  s lips was the most exhilarating feeling ever. I was alive. I was connected with\
  \ her and we were connected with everything around us. Standing there, under the\
  \ rain falling down on each and all of us without distinction, I wondered if I would\
  \ ever feel that alive again. Even then, like I know now, I immediately stopped\
  \ wondering about it because I already knew the answer."
