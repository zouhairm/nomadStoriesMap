Text: "It\u2019s not every day, your 22 year old sister asks you to join her on her\
  \ study abroad trip to Australia, all expenses paid by her. It was the summer of\
  \ 2010, and I was 19 years old. This was my chance to see the world; explore.\n\
  Arriving in Australia, we learned that the summer in America was actually the winter\
  \ in Australia. It was then, my sister told me she had decided not to pursue the\
  \ abroad classes, and vacation mode really set in. We decided to fly to Bangkok,\
  \ Thailand.\n\nWe were staying on Phi Phi Don, one of six islands in the group known\
  \ as Phi Phi. From the shore, the island of Phi Phi Le, appeared rather close. We\
  \ thought, the obvious choice was to rent a kayak for the day, venture to Phi Phi\
  \ Le and make it back in time for dinner. Piece of cake! Boy, were we wrong!\nThe\
  \ local islanders warned us. We thought, perhaps, their advice came with an ulterior\
  \ motive. They advised, we take the Tiki Boat there, instead. \u201CSilly, American\
  \ girls!\u201D, they must\u2019ve said, as we skipped toward the ocean, sea salt\
  \ in our hair; not a care in the world.\n\nAbout ~45 minutes into our journey, our\
  \ environment went from a fun island bay, to feeling like we were in the middle\
  \ of the ocean, just like that. The waves were choppy, as we looked around, a sea\
  \ of jellyfish surrounding us. My sister and I looked at each other, and without\
  \ words, knew it just got real. Making matters worse, my sister began to get sea\
  \ sick. As if the thought of dying from jellyfish in the ocean wasn\u2019t scary\
  \ enough, big tropical fish began leaping from the water to grab the puke as it\
  \ came out.\nWe saw a tiki boat coming into the bay, and waved for help. They thought\
  \ we were waving to say, Hi. We were, indeed, waving and yelling for our lives.\
  \ It was then, we realized, we were going to have to turn around and survive on\
  \ our own. We veered off to the right, to catch the end of the island. We, finally,\
  \ approached a tiki boat tied up near the island, still far away from where the\
  \ beachline begins. We asked the couple if we could come aboard and began explaining\
  \ what we had just faced. Before we could finish our story, they insisted we climb\
  \ aboard. The husband tied up our kayaks for us, explaining they were going to continue\
  \ snorkeling for awhile, if we didn\u2019t mind.\nOf course, we were thankful to\
  \ be alive. We proceeded to pass out on the tiki boat for the next two hours. Returning\
  \ back to the community, we caught glimpses of a few smiles, and marked the experience\
  \ in our minds as one we will never forget."
