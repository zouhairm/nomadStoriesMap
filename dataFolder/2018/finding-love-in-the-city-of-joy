Text: "\u2018Love them with all your heart\u2019  Sister Glenda told all of us volunteers\
  \ that first day at the Mission. Rather an abstract concept really. How can we just\
  \ \u2018love\u2019 strangers? We were an assorted group of travelers visiting Kolkata,\
  \ India's 'City of Joy'. All of us were drawn to this Mission founded by Mother\
  \ Teresa for a variety of reasons, mostly curiosity and a naive desire to help!\
  \  Our tasks that day would involve cooking for and feeding the patients, doing\
  \ the laundry, making beds, talking to the patients, cleaning bedpans or assisting\
  \ the nuns in changing the bedding of a bedridden patient. \n\nVibrant street markets\
  \ with their dizzying array of colorful goods ranging from textiles to spices, the\
  \ tantalizing aroma of street foods,  the warmth and friendliness of the people,\
  \ and listening to the colorful stories of stall holders while haggling over prices\
  \ were all reasons for my visiting Kolkata .  The bewildering display of exotic\
  \ fruits and vegetables: jackfruit, date palms, coconuts and mangoes just added\
  \ to the intensity of the street markets.\n \nLife in the Mission contrasted with\
  \ the life of the city surrounding it. The Mission itself was a cream colored two-storeyed\
  \ building with arches and domes; formerly a Hindu temple. Upon stepping inside\
  \ one was greeted by a sense of peace and calm. The Womens Room which I came to\
  \ know well was large, drab and sparsely decorated. The grey stone floor was surrounded\
  \ on both sides by raised platforms. Each platform supported a  row of cots where\
  \ the women spent much of their day.  The women - Kolkata\u2019s destitute - were\
  \ of all ages and health conditions. Some were ill with cancer, AIDS, TB and hepatitis;\
  \ some were just destitute. It was overwhelming at first to encounter them but by\
  \ talking to them I gained some insight into their lives.\n\nThere was Seema, alone\
  \ in the world and suffering from hepatitis and malnutrition, yet showing curiosity\
  \ about my stories of life in England; Ballaki, horribly disfigured but with a sense\
  \ of pride about her worth at the Mission as a vital help to the nuns and volunteers;\
  \  Meena who had been married, widowed and then abandoned by her family while in\
  \ her teens and yet was talking about learning to read and write to improve herself.\
  \ \n\nLove comes in many forms. The sheer resiliency, determination and love for\
  \ life of these women were truly uplifting. They inspired me to reevaluate my own\
  \ life and goals, and appreciate all that I have."
