Text: "I was stark naked, precariously positioned on a thin bed of oil-stained rags\
  \ being savagely kneaded by the craggy foot of an old Indian man, ironically named\
  \ Joy. My muffled pleas for mercy went purposefully unanswered and once again Joy\
  \ grasped the overhead ropes and began sweeping his foot down my body with such\
  \ ferocity it elicited involuntary tears. Not sad tears, not happy tears, they were\
  \ tears of someone whose body had entered fight or flight mode. Turns out neither\
  \ the fight or flight option was currently available as I had two deceivingly strong\
  \ women pinning me down by my feet. It seemed the only outlet was via my tear ducts.\n\
  \nWhen mum suggested we go to her favourite Ayurvedic Centre in the backwaters of\
  \ Kerala for her 60th birthday I reluctantly agreed, swayed by her stories of two\
  \ daily massages, oil bathes and afternoons spent at the chai shop. And maybe we\u2019\
  d even catch a Tata into town and sneak in a fish curry with roti, not part of our\
  \ Ayurvedic wellness plan but when on the Malabar Coast...right?\n\nAs Joy finished\
  \ rubbing me with his oily foot, which was also now coated in a layer of grime from\
  \ the floor, I breathed a sigh of relief. After the extreme pain of Joy\u2019s foot\
  \ came the divine pleasure of having warm oil drizzled over my forehead. The ladies\
  \ assigned to me during my treatment hurriedly ushered Joy from the room and moved\
  \ me from the floor to a timber treatment table. Still naked, modesty quickly becoming\
  \ something I used to have.\n\nOnce I was laying down the women started drizzling\
  \ lukewarm oil across my forehead, the large vat swayed from side to side dispersing\
  \ the warm thick liquid in a steady stream. The combination of their fast melodic\
  \ conversations and the oil running from left to right and back again lulled me\
  \ into almost hypnotic state for the entire treatment. The oil slowly trickled from\
  \ my forehead through my hair and the women swept it off the timber slab back into\
  \ a giant vat to be reused on me again the next day. \n\nWhen I got back to our\
  \ room I was instructed to wait in our decrepit bathroom while one of the women\
  \ fetched a bucket of boiling water which was to serve as a warm bath to remove\
  \ the viscous oil from my hair. When I emerged from the bathroom Mum was sitting\
  \ on the plastic chair in our room, waiting for her bucket of water to be brought\
  \ in.\n\n\u201CHow was your massage?\u201D She asked with a knowing smile."
