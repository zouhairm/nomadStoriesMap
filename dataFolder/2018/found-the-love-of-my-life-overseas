Text: A decision that pushed me to edge in New Zealand was that i had meet this Lovely
  girl from the UK at the start of 2016 and i had been working hard on a 6 month working
  contract in 2017 January-July and i was talking to my girlfriend at the time (now
  my fiance') who lives all the way in the UK she asked if i could come over after
  my contract finished as things were getting hard for us both distance wise, keep
  in mind that we have never seen each other in person before. We had been talking
  everyday for over a year. I said yea i can do that as i had saved a bit of money
  from my job and i went over and saw her for the first time in July 2017 for a month
  when i first saw waiting for me at the airport i gave her the biggest hug and nearly
  knocked her over haha! It was the best decision i have ever made I had an absolute
  ball though even though she had a broken wrist the whole time i was over but didn't
  stop her going on any rides at Blackpool though and i looked after her the whole
  time i was over. We went out pretty much every day into town and did things like
  shopping and having fun and then the time came where i had to be taken back to Manchester
  airport as i had to go back home and that was the hardest thing to ever do is saying
  good bye to the women i love and go back to New Zealand was crying all the way back
  home, I tried my best to get work when i got back in August of 2017 but no luck
  which sucked but with the remainder of the money i had left i purchased a ticket
  back over to see her again over Christmas time for 2 months leaving 5th December
  2017, now that was the best time i enjoyed myself there had a fantastic Christmas
  with her and her family and her family absolutely loves me to bits like a second
  son in the family so i'm grateful for that. 31st December comes along i go int town
  with her brother and his girlfriend while we for her to meet us at the Radio City
  Tower in town that i where we went to the top of the tower and got some fantastic
  views and pictures and waited till sunset (Unfortunately wasn't the best) but i
  waited for my girlfriend (Ashleigh) to have her back to me then i got down on one
  knee and i proposed to her up in the tower and was feeling so nervous but i'm so
  glad she said yes and can't wait to be with her for the rest of my life :) I am
  now back In New Zealand trying to look for work again so i can get back over to
  her ASAP but no luck so this might be something worth doing and be good for me to
  explore myself more.
