Text: "Entering the dimly light dark caves created by nature had always been a thrill.\
  \ Michael came to pick me up to go explore this \u201CCambioula Cave\u201D, name\
  \ that I never heard before. He didn\u2019t tell me much except \u201COh, yeah,\
  \ take your bathing trunk\u201D. Alright. \n\nOn this cool September morning, I\
  \ wasn\u2019t so sure about taking a bath in some cold water in a cave, but I trusted\
  \ Michael. On our way to the pyramidal \u201CBosson\u2019s Beaks\u201D, we were\
  \ soothed by some mystic Celtic songs. We didn\u2019t talk much, our minds were\
  \ transported to some fantastical past where druids performed their rituals and\
  \ warriors praying the Gods for protection. \n\nWe parked the car close to a little\
  \ wooden cabin. We walked for a couple minutes along a cold mountain river. We stopped\
  \ in front of a little bush. I was perplexed. The entrance of the cave was a small\
  \ hole kept open by an old wooden beam. I was not claustrophobic but, my breathing\
  \ was getting a bit harder. What if this man made support collapsed? I didn\u2019\
  t want to get stuck in this burrow. Michael was a trusted friend: Breath in, breath\
  \ out. Let\u2019s go. \n\nMichael already disappeared, swallowed by the darkness.\
  \ I bent to go through the gap and found a bigger \u201Croom\u201D than expected.\
  \ I looked around and realized that the red walls were covered with remnants of\
  \ candles left behind by some other adventurers. I put my feet in the water, it\
  \ was surprisingly warm. \u201CIt\u2019s an old sulfur mine\u201D Michael told me,\
  \ \u201Cit keeps the water at 28 degrees C (83 F)\u201D. \n\nI had been wondering\
  \ what that smell was. He showed me the end of this \u201Clobby\u201D. There was\
  \ a little opening at the end. We had to dive under water to reach the next room.\
  \ He lead the way, I hid my anxiety as much as possible. Michael was gone. He stretched\
  \ his arm from the other side to guide me and pull me out faster. I swum for only\
  \ a couple seconds. The room was already light by some candles. We weren\u2019t\
  \ the first to come today. We looked at each other with a satisfied smile. We relaxed\
  \ and just let our bodies float in this quite womb. We meditated for a moment. My\
  \ hair and my beard stroked by the perfumed warm water. I could hear my own heart\
  \ beat in my ears, the chants from the Celtic music coming back to mind. I felt\
  \ like a men from the olden days: a Helvetic warrior. I reconnected with a part\
  \ of myself too often forgotten. It was calming and invigorating. I felt complete.\
  \ A new strength accompanied my steps as I emerged from the darkness. A new man\
  \ who had been blessed by the 65 million year old Alps."
