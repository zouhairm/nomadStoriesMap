Text: "I picked her up in the airport with two beers in my hand. I thought she was\
  \ not going to come, with all the news, but she was there, with her beautiful nervous\
  \ smile. I planned to kiss her. I didn\u2019t dare. I gave her a beer instead. I\
  \ had already been there for three weeks and that week we were going to spend it\
  \ together traveling around. Two Spanish guys and a British girl that were volunteering\
  \ in the same hostel as I was joined us. We rented a car. We needed to wake up early\
  \ to drive to the next city and be there before the tour started at 11am. It was\
  \ a tour that only takes place on Fridays, so we only had one chance. We didn\u2019\
  t party that night. Instead we set a small cinema in the terrace of the hostel.\
  \ They watched Grand Hotel Budapest. We kissed. \n\nThe sun. The sand. The radio.\
  \ Checkpoint at the border. No authority. The desert. The flags. The bottle of warm\
  \ water and plastic taste that we passed around. Google maps. The cars with loud\
  \ music. The signs. The desert. The endless desert. Her smile. The local music in\
  \ the radio that I force them to listen. The hectic center of the de-facto capital.\
  \ \u201CTurn here left\u201D- the british girl said to the driver. \n\nTwo hours\
  \ after we were in another vehicle, a van, the tour van. Friday is their holy day\
  \ so all the families can be outside protesting. International NGOs and journalist\
  \ are in the area. This is the tour, we should have known since it was called political\
  \ tour. Kids throw rocks towards the Israeli sordiers 200 meters away behind the\
  \ wall. Adults don\u2019t mind them, they just chant vigorously waving Palestinian\
  \ flags and different signs in different languages very far from the wall. Not enough\
  \ for them. The rain of tear gas in the sunny day makes everyone search for cover.\
  \ Kids kick the cans, adults cover up their faces, tourist and foreigners run in\
  \ panic. The doors open and a military car starts the chase. Up hill. The rocks.\
  \ Run.The sand. The tears. Run. The lack of air. The chants. Climb another rock.\
  \ I see one of the spanish guy excited with red eyes. The british girl definitely\
  \ didn\u2019t signed for this. Friday in Bil\u2019in. One dutch missing from our\
  \ tour came back at 9pm to the hostel. Some people were entering the police station\
  \ at the same time he took the first bite of the sandwich the police gave him, handcuffed\
  \ and heads covered; palestinians. Police took him to the hostel and left him with\
  \ a smile. We are in the living room. We all watched a documentary that night. The\
  \ screen. Friday night."
