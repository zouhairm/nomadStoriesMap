Text: "I was crushed when I had to return to California because my visa in France\
  \ to teach, was expiring. I worked all year and saved up to travel throughout Asia.\
  \ My plan was three months in each: Thailand, India and China. Asia was so different\
  \ from traveling in the \"western world\". First, I didn't look anything like the\
  \ people around me, so I didn't have the sense of fitting in that I had cherished\
  \ in Europe and South America. However, I was surprised by how easy it was to get\
  \ around by speaking English and by how friendly and hospitable the locals were.\
  \ Friends in San Francisco told me about a small island in the Gulf of Thailand,\
  \ called Koh Phangan and a remote beach and resort called, The Sanctuary. After\
  \ exploring the North of Thailand, where I learned Thai Massage in the hill tribes\
  \ and spent weeks meditating in the famous Wat Doi Suthep, I ventured South.\nI\
  \ arrived at the Tong Sala pier after a long night by bus from Bangkok and a ferry\
  \ ride to the island. Apparently, I had arrived on the opposite side of the island\
  \ from my destination. So, I rented a motorbike and attempted the journey, only\
  \ to find myself on steep, unpaved jungle hills which I couldn't navigate. I found\
  \ another route to the beach and stayed in the shared room of the Sanctuary. This\
  \ decision changed my life forever as it led me to put my passport in the resort's\
  \ safe. After several days wandering between the rocky paths that connected three\
  \ remote beaches of spectacular turquoise, warm water, swimming, snorkeling, practicing\
  \ yoga and laying in the sun, it was time to leave Thailand for India. \nAgain,\
  \ I booked a boat, bus combo trip back to Bangkok. At the first stop towards mainland,\
  \ I realized my passport was still in the safe! I got off the boat and rerouted\
  \ myself back. On the ferry, thinking to myself \"why did this happen?\", I saw\
  \ a handsome man looking at me and knew I had to meet him. At the end of the ride,\
  \ we started to talk and he told me he lived on the island and offered to help me\
  \ get my passport and invited me to dinner. We talked all night and although he\
  \ asked me to postpone my trip to India to stay with him, I left the next morning.\
  \ We kept in touch and met three months later to travel to Angkor Wat, in Cambodia\
  \ together. There, we fell in love. The last thing I expected of my trip to Asia\
  \ was to find my partner in life and live there, but that is exactly what happened.\
  \ We lived together on Koh Phangan and got married a couple years later. My life,\
  \ changed forever."
