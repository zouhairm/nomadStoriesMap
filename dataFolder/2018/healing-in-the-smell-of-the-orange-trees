Text: "The saying that tourists soon begin to pick up after a few days in the city\
  \ is, \"Sevilla tiene un color especial.\" Seville has her own color/ a special\
  \ color. The phrase takes after a famous song written about the historical, Southern\
  \ city in Spain. What I had thought the saying meant was that Seville was a vibrant,\
  \ colorful, warm city close to the coast of Spain, making the temperatures not only\
  \ physically hot but the people quite a few degrees warmer and more carefree than\
  \ those in Northern Spain. \n\nHowever, I soon realized that the \"color\" the song\
  \ was referring to was not simply about the coastal temperatures or the beams of\
  \ evening sunlight that bounced off the skinny streets creating pink shadows on\
  \ the balconies of every apartment. No, the color was referring to the feel of Sevilla,\
  \ the impression, the heart of it. \n\nWhen I left to move and study in Sevilla,\
  \ I left brokenhearted. The image of who I was had been shattered and I came to\
  \ Sevilla looking for myself. Through the months, I came to develop a pattern of\
  \ taking evening walks. It was in these walks that I felt least alone. \n\nI watched\
  \ the little children running in the streets, parents sitting on benches watching\
  \ them play. I passed the same gypsy woman playing her accordion and singing the\
  \ same song over and over, her deep, shaky voice whining the lyrics, \"B\xE9same,\
  \ b\xE9same. Como si fuera \xE9sta noche la \xFAltima veeezzz.\" It was here, walking\
  \ in the cool air, taking in the sweet smell of the orange trees that lined the\
  \ streets, side by side by side, that I bumped into a girl about my age, handing\
  \ out business cards. We began talking. \n\nShe explained to me she was there to\
  \ get people to visit a tattoo shop nearby, where her friends were tattoo artists.\
  \ I had nowhere I was going, as was the purpose of these wandering, evening walks,\
  \ and so I followed her to the shop. I left with a card and an appointment for a\
  \ month later.\n\nA few weeks from leaving Spain, and I was on a table with a needle\
  \ etching a picture of a piece of fruit into my arm: an orange. I had found Sevilla's\
  \ color in the phrase: \"Tu eres mi media naranja.\" You are my better half. Or\
  \ translated literally: You are the other half of my orange. I laughed the first\
  \ time I heard it. But it made perfect sense: the coming of warm weather was told\
  \ by the orange trees, whether they were ripe, whether the white flowers of the\
  \ trees were in bloom and smelling sweet. It was in those walks, in the smell of\
  \ the orange trees that I found myself again."
