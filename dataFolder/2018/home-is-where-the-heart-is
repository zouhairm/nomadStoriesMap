Text: "Born and brought up in Europe, it came as a surprise that life took a grand\
  \ turn to me living in Asia for a good part of a year. Going from the little Emerald\
  \ Island of Ireland to the exciting and largely unknown country of Pakistan (due\
  \ to lack of positive media perspectives). It was made apparent quite early on in\
  \ my journey that there were many a similarity to the cultures that both my ancestors\
  \ and myself hail from. Both cultures embrace the notion of hospitality and friendship,\
  \ a comradery that no one can deny. They have immense pride in their values and\
  \ traditions, and no matter where in the world they might end up in, they never\
  \ cease to remember Home. The two countries boast some of the world\u2019s most\
  \ beautifully lush pastures, ruggedly iconic mountain ranges and natural rock formations,\
  \ and water masses which imbue artistic shades of greens and blues. As a child growing\
  \ up in a country so full of nature and wilderness, it was to my delight that I\
  \ found the same in Northern Pakistan. It was pure bliss and felt like a piece of\
  \ heaven on Earth. The people who reside in these parts, such as Hunza and Skardu,\
  \ mostly hail from certain tribes of the surrounding regions or from soldiers from\
  \ Alexander the Great\u2019s vast armies. These soldiers were mostly Greek or Irish\
  \ \u2013 here I found another piece of my individual heritage in the land of my\
  \ ancestors. Or so I learned of from a local man who we found fishing by the side\
  \ of a lake where we were boating in. It was quite an exciting revelation, because\
  \ he did not know where I was from and I think I can rely on his word as he published\
  \ an interesting historical book with a French scholar, based on recent archaeological\
  \ researches on Buddhist finds conducted in the region. \nDespite not having the\
  \ same language as the people of the region, it was still very easy to feel a sense\
  \ of homeliness and an instant connection with their shy smiles and friendly gestures\
  \ of hospitality. Being so many thousands of miles away from home, there was not\
  \ a chance of feeling a fraction of homesickness. Right from the moment of our descent\
  \ in our little PIA plane through a cloudy mountainous passage, to watching the\
  \ sunrise over the peak of Mt. Rakaposhi from the famous Eagle\u2019s Nest, to simply\
  \ sitting in amongst the music of nature whilst sipping on freshly-squeezed apple\
  \ juice \u2013 there was no other place I would rather be than in the North of Pakistan.\
  \ My camera and I look forward to our next adventure to this part of the world again."
