Text: it was my first time on a new country all by myself, just me, my backpack and
  unexplored territory by me.As we know, the summer in Europe is from june to september,
  the perfect time to go the the prettiest beaches on the continent, but i work on
  the summer time, so once summer ended, so did my job,the first thing i did was to
  pack my thing and go on a trip,  i took a plane and  landed on the airport of Rhodes,
  Greece, one of the smallest islands of that amazing country surrounded by the open
  sea , i arrived at the perfect time to jump in a taxi and watch how the sun slowly
  vanished inside the blue sea leaving a red sky that turned quicky into a sky full
  of constelations, but it wasn't like others sunsets i ever watch, it was diferent,
  the city was almost desert, just a few tourist and the local people, perfect weather
  and the magnific orchest the waves breaking the coast made, that was the fist thing
  i saw, and i was trilled to what Rhodes had to offer me for the next 6 days . my
  fisrt stop was on the old Rhodes town, sorrounded by a tall wall that leaded to
  the new town, i slept all night and woke up ready for my aventure, i walk around
  the coast and took a lot of photos, walk on the parks and talk with a few locals,
  time passed and i found myself looking at another masterpiece, but this time it
  was on the Ruins of the old town, what a beautiful sunset, beathtaking as the firts,
  but completly different, the next day i made a friend, it was an old local man that
  rescue cats from the streets and put them on a house that he build for them near
  the beach, it was so full of stories, and that was how spend my third sunsted, a
  new difert one, with 7 cats an old man and a  a hot cup of coffe, i returned my
  hotel satisfied and happy, with hurry to wake up the next day and move to my next
  stop. it took me 45 minutes in bus to go to the top of the island to almost the
  south, i  found myself on one of the most popular beaches of the island almost all
  for my self and the baywatchers, i spend all the day on the water, luckly my hotel
  room was meters away form the beach, and so i spend the last 2 days in the wather
  watching how the sunset felt while i was inside the sea, i felt amused, like i were
  on top of the world and the sun disapear below me, leaving me alone again with the
  stars, and so time past and arrived at my last day and so my last sunset, that i
  watched on a bench outside the airport as i sayd goodbye, i never expected being
  that much startreck by sunsets.
