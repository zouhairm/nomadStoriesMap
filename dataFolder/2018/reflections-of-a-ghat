Text: "The plane rose and I watched the banks of river Narmada fade to a spread of\
  \ blue and white ombre at Gwari Ghat. The fragrance of sweet water seemed to linger\
  \ on my skin, in my hair, like a memory that couldn\u2019t be washed away. I tried\
  \ to imagine what Madhya Pradesh would look like and recalled the photos from National\
  \ Geographic and other giants showing a jungle so thick it resembled the entrails\
  \ of a giant beast, vines winding about primordial trees. Here, here, was the place\
  \ for accomplishing something, for transforming. \n\nAnd who knows? Maybe through\
  \ the process, I would emerge in some new wild and fantastic place like one of the\
  \ lands of my childhood imagination.\nDown below, Narmada\u2019s perfect illusion\
  \ was succumbing to the chaos that had started just before I left. There my eyes\
  \ captured something a camera\u2019s lens could never capture, a picture I would\
  \ never look at from that perspective which I did, I did then as a 16-year-old.\
  \ A woman fresh out of the bath out on her daily chores. As a man approached her\
  \ and smeared colour all over her hair and face, the woman was all giggles. And\
  \ then the question, if this woman knows this man, what made her buy another bar\
  \ of soap and go wash at the ghat again, after having taken a bath already. And\
  \ that question still lingers, like those books of Murakami staring at me through\
  \ the bookshelf in my room, denying any closure, no matter how many times I read\
  \ it, no matter how closely I read it. That chaos that is in my head now. That is\
  \ what stays. That is what is eternal. The Chaos. The ombre of thoughts reminiscent\
  \ of every colour present in that time, even the ones my human eyes could not see."
