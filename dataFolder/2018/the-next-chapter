Text: "My backpack was tightly secured to my front while I hugged it to my body for\
  \ my entire three-hour bus ride to Santiago de Cali, more commonly known as Cali\
  \ \u2014 the third largest city in Colombia for Halloween weekend.\n Cali had a\
  \ dangerous reputation that stemmed from the Cali drug cartel, as well as frequent\
  \ kidnappings and murders in the city and surrounding areas throughout the \u2018\
  90s and \u201800s. This reputation didn\u2019t leave my mind as I stepped off of\
  \ my bus and made my way to meet my friends at our hostel. \n In the past few years,\
  \ the reputation for danger has decreased as kidnappings and murder rates have dropped\
  \ substantially and Cali has opened itself up as a tourist destination. The city\
  \ is now known more for being the heart of salsa music than its former violence,\
  \ but I still held my reservations. I had no intention to \u201Cdar papaya\u201D\
  \ \u2014 make myself an easy target for robbery.\n Two hours after arriving at my\
  \ hostel I received a text from my mom that changed my life.\n \u201CI want you\
  \ to know that Aunt Linda passed away about a half an hour ago. It\u2019s ok that\
  \ she\u2019s gone, she doesn\u2019t have to suffer anymore.\u201D\n My aunt had\
  \ been fighting cancer for seven years, and while my aunt\u2019s death wasn\u2019\
  t as gruesome or violent as the thousands of untimely murders that plagued the city\
  \ for decades, it came as a surprise to me that the woman I had just spoken to on\
  \ Facetime a week earlier was gone.\n To fight my sadness the next morning, I found\
  \ a mirador near our hostel that I was determined to hike up to rather than spending\
  \ more of my trip crying in a hostel hammock.\n The hike up took over an hour as\
  \ we moved from winding paved roads where kids were starting to trick-or-treat to\
  \ narrow dirt passages where cows grazed on the hillside around us.\n Instead of\
  \ finding danger and violence on the uninhabited mountaintop as we might have a\
  \ decade ago, we reached the top of the mirador and my friend and I found Colombian\
  \ children playing on the edge of a mountain, fellow tourists enjoying their hikes,\
  \ a middle-aged woman selling obleas \u2014 thin wafers filled with arequipe, a\
  \ favored dessert in Colombia \u2014 and one of the most stunning views of not only\
  \ the city of Cali, but the vast greenery that once represented danger outstretched\
  \ it and spread in all directions.\n From the top of the mirador, Cali wasn\u2019\
  t a scary place anymore. It was a place of strength, and perseverance through difficult\
  \ times.\n If this city that had endured so much grief could rebuild itself, then\
  \ maybe I could too."
