Text: "During my first vacation in the US, I had visited 7 cities in 30 days, stayed\
  \ in 7 different hostels sharing rooms with about 60 different people, rode about\
  \ 3,000 miles in 7 different buses, but it was here, in Houston, Texas, where I\
  \ realized that I can travel completely alone and still find a family and a home\
  \ everywhere I go. \nFrom my very first seconds in this magnolia-smelling, southernly-bright\
  \ and surprisingly quiet (with a population of 2.303 million people!) city with\
  \ a relaxing buzz of old cars slowly passing on bumpy roads, I felt like I lived\
  \ here my whole life, I felt loved and taken care of. The owner of the hostel (or\
  \ should I rather say \u2018home\u2019 because it looked nothing like a touristic\
  \ business place), \u201Cmama Don\u201D as she introduced herself, made me every\
  \ day her rustic vegetable soup and let me decorate her Christmas tree under a vigilant\
  \ supervision of her mom, a sweet old lady who knitted me a small scarf. We also\
  \ put on the lights on the palms around the house (otherwise, in this summer-like\
  \ weather you would not realize that New Year was coming) and sang Christmas songs\
  \ to my accompaniment on the untuned piano in the living room.    \nHonestly, the\
  \ whole city felt like home with its sun-drenched streets where people are slowly\
  \ heading home to have cozy dinners with their family or walking their dogs and\
  \ discussing with them new neighbors\u2019 behavior. Everything and everyone was\
  \ mixed here, and everything and everyone was accepted: intimidating skyscrapers\
  \ with the hole in the middle (architects\u2019 whim) and \u2018plantation palaces\u2019\
  \ with snow-white columns and enormous palms; barred windows and graffiti in downtown\
  \ and names of streets laid with colorful pebbles; London-style phone booths and\
  \ Mexican taverns. My family was this tall, poorly-dressed Afro-American man who\
  \ saw me from the train\u2019s window walking for 6 stops to see the downtown and\
  \ yelled \u2018Why would such a beautiful young lady walk so far away?\u2019 My\
  \ family was this Mexican street-sweeper who welcomed me every morning on my way\
  \ to supermarket with his cheerful \u2018Habla Espa\xF1ol?\u2019 and something else\
  \ in Spanish about my eyes. \nAnd even the Greyhound bus driver bringing me away\
  \ from Texas to my next destination and warning everyone that 'you can\u2019t smoke,\
  \ drink, speak or chew loudly, or - God saves you from it - annoy the driver', behaved\
  \ like a father to me at every station making sure I did not get left behind. Home\
  \ is how Texas felt for me, a girl who grew up in the far north of Russia."
