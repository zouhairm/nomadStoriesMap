Text: "\u201CNothing lives in the mine,\u201D says our squat, Quechua guide. Our dim\
  \ miner headlamps splash spotlights on her earth-kissed, dust-worn face, and then\
  \ her round potato back as she leads on. Against the low ceiling, we hunch and crane\
  \ our necks to illuminate sagging wood beam supports, abandoned tunnels and tools,\
  \ railway track. And stone. And dirt. Occasionally, the light catches fluorescent\
  \ mineral stalactites, azure and cardinal and honey, that drip in waxy strands,\
  \ or stalagmites that ooze a glossy black hue. Our guide humps on, answering questions\
  \ in her gnashing English. She is not a pleasant woman, understandably so, for her\
  \ life does not seem pleasant. \nWe are deep in the bowels of El Cerro Rico, The\
  \ Rich Mountain. It is one of the largest and oldest silver mines in the world.\
  \ The entire mountain is said to be made of silver ore. It has been in continuous\
  \ operation since the Spanish discovered the lode in the 16th century. Millions\
  \ of Quechua natives have labored here and hundreds of thousands, if not more, have\
  \ died inside. The rest\u2014in its shadow. \nWe wind our way deeper, claustrophobia\
  \ growing with every step, until we come upon the cavern of El Tio. A man-sized\
  \ red clay devil, he is the god inside the mine, for when the sky is no longer in\
  \ sight, allegiances turn underground. He has bulging eyes and a huge phallus. Colorful\
  \ streams of confetti cover his lap and horns. A lit cigarette hangs from his mouth,\
  \ and his feet are strewn with coca leaves and alcohol bottles. These are the offerings\
  \ of the miners. They say that when they offer pure, the minerals come pure. And\
  \ accidents are avoided. \nWe visit a miner who works alone. He has worked the mine\
  \ for 24 years and is 63 years old, well past the average life expectancy. He is\
  \ the oldest man in the mine\u2014thanks to Tio\u2014he says. He has returned to\
  \ the mine because his son has died of lung problems, and now his son's family needs\
  \ money. He forgoes lunch, instead chewing coca and drinking soda. He tells how\
  \ the air can be toxic when pockets of gas are unearthed.\nHe hasn't the chance\
  \ to see the world, but it comes to see him. He smiles and laughs and gives what\
  \ he can, a rock with sparkling bronze in it to each of us. He reminds me humanity\
  \ can exist against incredible odds, in unlivable places, this one a 20-million-year-old\
  \ volcano turned 500-year-old mine without a rat or plant or insect for company.\
  \ No life exists here except the menial miner\u2019s. All he wants is companionship,\
  \ even just a moment\u2019s worth."
