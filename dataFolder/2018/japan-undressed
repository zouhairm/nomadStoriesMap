Text: "I was standing in the hallway of a change room, located within a traditional\
  \ Japanese hot spring, on my first solo trip to Japan. My Japanese friend Akemi,\
  \ and her mother moved to the other side of the lockers to get changed. I was enjoying\
  \ this brief time alone, as it had been a week of constant contact with people,\
  \ and it was nice to have a few minutes of reflection on the trip so far. \n\nI\
  \ began to think about how nice it was to see the closeness between Akemi and her\
  \ mother, something I could relate to through my relationship with my mother. Yet,\
  \ only a couple of nights before, Akemi was explaining the very private nature of\
  \ a Japanese child's relationship with their parents. I found this quite interesting,\
  \ as she told me that she had not told her mother about most of the things I would\
  \ not have thought twice about. My mum is practically my relationship counsellor,\
  \ and Akemi had not even told her mum basic details about her relations with past\
  \ boyfriends. I could sense that there was an unspoken code of behaviour between\
  \ Akemi and her mother, and I could respect this mutual understanding. It made me\
  \ wonder if sometimes, maybe I expose a little too much to my mother. Maybe there\
  \ are some things I really should not reveal, despite it feeling natural.\n\nAs\
  \ my mental reflection between the lockers of a random Japanese change room was\
  \ finally drawing to an end, I began to wonder where Akemi and her mother were anyway,\
  \ and why they were not changing into their swimmers next to me. I could hear soft\
  \ whispers behind me, in the Japanese language which I was still attempting to grasp.\
  \ I already felt out of place with my foreign, European body, and I was not proud\
  \ about the lack of coverage my swimmers were providing. I felt even worse because\
  \ this trip had come to teach me about the private nature of the Japanese culture,\
  \ and here I was exposing a little too much of myself again. I reached my hand into\
  \ my locker, to take my towel; and the last thing I expected to see to the corner\
  \ of my eye, was Akemi and her mother standing before me, completely naked, giggling\
  \ at me with my swimmers on."
