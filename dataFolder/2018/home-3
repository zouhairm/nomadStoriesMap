Text: "Obnoxiously bright lights fill the entire store. I\u2019m tempted to wear my\
  \ sunglasses indoors, but I already feel out of place. I\u2019m only here to buy\
  \ some shampoo, but I\u2019ve been staring at the same shelf for ten minutes now.\
  \ There are two hundred types of shampoo. \u2018Why did I come here?\u2019, I think.\
  \ The aisles are long and the tile floors are spotless. I rub my eyes and massage\
  \ my temples. \u2018I can do this\u2019, I tell myself. Grabbing a bottle from the\
  \ shelf, I hurry away from the aisle, only to be met by a longer one. I\u2019m out\
  \ of breath when I reach the registers. I bite my lip, keeping my eyes on the floor\
  \ as I stand in line. My hands are sweating and my heart is bouncing. \u201CNo bag,\
  \ please\u201D I mumble, then take my receipt. I awkwardly pause for the automatic\
  \ door to open, then breathe in the October air. I sit in my car, letting tears\
  \ run down my cheeks. I haven\u2019t driven in years. \u2018No one told me about\
  \ this part\u2019, I think. But, its the hardest thing I\u2019ve ever done. My thoughts\
  \ are riddled with fear. \n\nI\u2019m home. \n\nI arrived two days ago at the Pittsburgh\
  \ International Airport where I hugged my parents for the first time in years. I\u2019\
  m greeted with laughter, my old dog and questions about my travels. Seated on my\
  \ parent\u2019s couch I\u2019ve been storytelling of my adventures, drinking coffee\
  \ and sleeping in late. I left for Costa Rica four years ago. I made my way into\
  \ Panama and later found a job in Bolivia. By now, my Spanish is second nature,\
  \ I prefer rice and beans, I respond to \u201CChoca\u201D faster than my real name,\
  \ and I still carry pepper spray wherever I go. \n\nThroughout my time in Latin\
  \ America, I\u2019ve lived on a boat in the Amazon River, fished for piranha, eaten\
  \ sugar cane pulled from the Earth, escaped from a loose bull in a small river village,\
  \ hiked on volcanos, fought a tarantula and won, zip lined over waterfalls, sailed\
  \ next to pink river dolphins at dawn, crawled through caves on my stomach, chewed\
  \ coca during high altitude climbs, discovered dinosaur tracks in dried river beds,\
  \ sand boarded desert dunes and had every parasite and virus known in South America.\
  \ But, here I am facing my toughest challenge yet. I have a degree in anthropology,\
  \ I did internships, I took cross-cultural communications course, I studied Spanish.\
  \ Yet, I can\u2019t walk into Target without feeling like I\u2019m going to faint.\
  \ \n\nIt turns out, I\u2019m a nomad now. A citizen of the world.  I\u2019m part\
  \ of a small group of people that know the moment you step away from your home,\
  \ it\u2019s not your only home anymore."
