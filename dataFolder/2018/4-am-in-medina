Text: "At 4:25 A.M we heard the prayer call reach our hotel rooms. My Dad sprang out\
  \ of bed, eager to reach morning prayers. It was our second day in Medina, Saudi\
  \ Arabia, and my parents and I were completing Omrah, the off-season pilgrimage\
  \ to Mecca. I dressed in traditional Islamic attire, a long, loose gown and black\
  \ head scarf that I never seemed to learn how to keep in place. Remembering how\
  \ chilly the morning had been before, I wore my black bomber jacket overtop, and\
  \ admired how interestingly modern the combination looked. My mother and I walked\
  \ slowly towards the mosque.  The surrounding area was covered in tiles and contained\
  \ monstrous pillars lined in neat little rows. To the right of the mosque, men were\
  \ frantically laying out long stretches of red Persian rugs, while other men swept\
  \ the area and cleaned any trash left behind. We glanced at the crowded entrance.\
  \ Not wanting to get stuck in the sea of pushing women, my mother and I chose to\
  \ sit on the sparsely populated carpets outside. The air was perfect \u2013 cool\
  \ but not cold. There was something so beautiful about praying outdoors, or even\
  \ just sitting outdoors in meditation. The area began to fill up, and two women\
  \ sat next to me reading Quran. I opened my English translation and continued reading.\
  \ We intermittently stood up and prayed, as it is widely believed that formal prayer\
  \ in such a holy site is worth thousands of prayers back home. As we sat engrossed\
  \ in our literature, the woman beside me began to break down in tears. At first\
  \ they were quiet tears, that she wiped away quickly, but as she continued praying\
  \ I could sense that she was breaking down, and her body began shaking. I glanced\
  \ at her friend sitting next to her. I wondered if this woman had suffered a loss\
  \ recently. Feeling awkward and helpless, I sat for a moment as she cried. I began\
  \ to pat her on the back. Her friend did the same. We sat arms around her swaying\
  \ with her as she cried. After a few minutes she wiped away her last tears. The\
  \ prayer began, and without any words, we stood up in a line and followed the prayer.\
  \ As we finished, the pillars began to open into square umbrellas, shielding the\
  \ sky. They were so large and robotic that as they slowly expanded it felt like\
  \ we were gearing up to go into outer space. It was sunrise, and these umbrellas\
  \ protected the area from the Saudi heat. As we stood up, the lady turned and smiled\
  \ to me. We hugged tightly. We separated, and the thoughts of this moment lingered\
  \ in my head for days."
