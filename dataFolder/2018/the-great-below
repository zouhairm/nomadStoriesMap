Text: "I left the rest of the tourists on the deck of the paraw and made my way into\
  \ the water, lowering myself down the aching, eroded, wooden steps. I understand\
  \ why someone wouldn\u2019t want to jump into open water. A lot of people worry\
  \ when they\u2019re out of their depth, which goes for snorkeling and most other\
  \ aspects of life. I like the mystery of it all. I always feel desperate for the\
  \ great below.\n\nI pulled my snorkel into place and disappeared below the surface.\
  \ The mask sucked in around my eyes, my heartbeat and breathing thundering in my\
  \ ears. I would never get used to the sensation. It threw me that I could be the\
  \ wrong side of the waterline and able to breathe. \nAhead of me, a pair of yellow\
  \ flippers dove to the floor, spiraling, having fun. I watched the skinny boy attached\
  \ to them as he arched backwards and rose to the surface alongside the bubbles,\
  \ a big smile on his face as he spat his snorkel away. \nHe pointed to me. \nHe\
  \ pointed below. \nI dipped my face and saw a clownfish working its way between\
  \ stacks of alien-like corals beneath my pale feet. Treading water, I lifted my\
  \ mask and smiled back at him, the only truly international language. This continued\
  \ back and forth a few times as we waited for anything else to happen.\n\nHe made\
  \ a calling gesture to me with puckered fingers. With a momentary glance over my\
  \ shoulder to check the boat wasn\u2019t leaving anytime soon, I followed, watching\
  \ him get further and further ahead due to the unfair advantage of the flippers.\
  \ He stopped to wait for me, suspended between the blue of the sky and the blue\
  \ of the sea. We went on.\n\nFurther out, we came to a shimmering wall. Without\
  \ checking back, he went straight through it, glossy bricks parting for him before\
  \ returning into place to separate the pair of us. The Moalboal Sardine Run is famous\
  \ enough to be known but outstanding to behold. I swam amongst the school, watching\
  \ them billow and shimmer around me. I wondered how they could have come together\
  \ and what made them stay. The boy in the flippers watched me dip up and down through\
  \ his field of vision as the fish played games with me. \n\nWhen they got bored\
  \ of my flapping, the fish moved on. I tried to thank my local guide but couldn\u2019\
  t ruin the moment with words. We were better off below the waves where I couldn\u2019\
  t say anything stupid. \nI swam back to the boat, unable to relay the wonder of\
  \ the experience to those who had stayed above the line."
