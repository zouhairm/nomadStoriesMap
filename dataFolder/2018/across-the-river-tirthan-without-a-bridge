Text: "Car parked, we stepped out and walked over to the rain-washed wooden hoarding:\
  \ \u2018Vishnu\u2019s Estate\u2019, it read. The Tirthan River gushed along, gentle\
  \ yet forceful, one hundred feet below us! \n\nBreath-taking! But, there wasn\u2019\
  t a man in sight for miles.\n\nWe\u2019d followed our map quite precisely. The hoarding\
  \ was testimony. Dad kept fidgeting with the map\u2019s frayed edges. Mom and I\
  \ stood on our tiptoes to peer for someone on the other side of the mighty Tirthan.\n\
  \nThe air felt thin; a happy nip in the wind. My cheeks had slowly begun to flush\
  \ a light pink to mimic the evening skies.\n\nOut of the fog on the other side of\
  \ the river appeared the silhouette of a man. When he waved at us, I was pretty\
  \ sure he had a smile. He started gesturing towards something on our side. \nNone\
  \ of us had noticed \u2013 there was a ramshackle ropeway just behind the hoarding;\
  \ connecting the main road to the fog-shrouded estate on the other side. The lean\
  \ silhouette forcefully pushed a heavy looking cart our way, following it up with\
  \ another vague hand gesture.\n\nWe stood there, watching it swing along to us.\
  \ \u201CHop in and I\u2019ll haul you over to the estate. Myself Vishnu, Sir\u201D\
  , he hollered merrily. The hills joined in to echo him.\n\n\u201CIs this the only\
  \ way?\u201D my dad inquired back, anxious. \nAll of 13, I found myself wishing\
  \ it was.\nThe prospect of crossing a glacial river in a handmade ropeway thrilled\
  \ me! \n\n10 long minutes of hesitation and mild trepidation later, we were all\
  \ aboard the ropeway, luggage safely nestled besides us. Vishnu pulled us over to\
  \ his side and helped us alight. He was a middle-aged man, laugh lines around the\
  \ edges of his mouth, rippling veins on his fore arms peeked through casually folded\
  \ sleeves. He wasn\u2019t feeling cold.\n\nThe cosy living room had a fireplace,\
  \ the textured creamy walls were lined with books, and Vishnu poured us some steaming\
  \ hot coffee \u2018to melt the ice rather than break it\u2019. It worked; an hour\
  \ later we were all engaged in stories about the adjoining woods. Every now and\
  \ then, my mind flitted to the gushing sound of the river, the crackling of flames\
  \ in the fireplace, the sweet smell of pine wood. By the time the sun set, we\u2019\
  d heard of tigers from beyond the big rocks, the apricot orchard his wife looked\
  \ after, spirits that could only be heard on moonless nights, and sunrises that\
  \ turned the river orange. \nI\u2019m sure the Tirthan carried our stories to distant\
  \ lands that night. I think all rivers do\u2026\nProbably why they keep changing\
  \ shades along their journey..."
