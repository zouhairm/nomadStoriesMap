Text: "It was possibly the most grim bathroom I had ever come across. A toilet patterned\
  \ grey with use lurked in one corner, while a dire brown drip, that I suspected\
  \ was drawn from the not-so-clean depths of the river below, served as a shower\
  \ in the other. The floor was lightly awash with liquid and mud, and the smell,\
  \ though not as unpleasant as anticipated, still came on with a physical force.\
  \ I fluttered helplessly in the doorway. Vamos chica! someone called behind me,\
  \ and in I went:  after all, cleanliness is not a priority when you are riding a\
  \ cargo ship down the Amazon River. \n\nA three day trip as human freight was the\
  \ last route I had expected to take from Colombia to Peru, but with the costs of\
  \ cross-border flights yapping at my heels I had landed myself a reservation for\
  \ a three day, all-expenses-paid (excluding a room, a bed or, debatably, a shower)\
  \ cruise down the most enigmatic river in the world. My trip began in Leticia, a\
  \ port town teetering on the southern point of Colombia, jostling for position between\
  \ Peru and Brazil, and was to finish in Iquitos, a Peruvian city three days upstream,\
  \ and the largest settlement in the world inaccessible by road.  \n\nThis is not\
  \ a ride for adrenaline junkies. Space was a valuable resource: hammocks formed\
  \ tight parallel rows, but quickly sprung up perpendicular along the side of the\
  \ ship, stacked haphazardly on top of one another. Within the labyrinth of ropes,\
  \ luggage and children you could navigate your way to a tiny deck where we searched\
  \ the waters ahead for el botos, the pink river dolphins of the Amazon. The front\
  \ deck doubled as a popular drinking spot for the local men aboard, who punctuated\
  \ their fiery debates and interrogations of los gringos with empty beer cans tossed\
  \ overboard. \n\nMostly though, I swung gently in my hammock, the humidity dampening\
  \ my lungs and clinging to my movements,  and watched the Amazon slip by.  It bulged\
  \ and constricted, meandering its endless way through a seemingly infinite rainforest.\
  \  During the days the reverie was broken by the ship pulling into villages to unload\
  \ its wares; during the nights, fork lightening splintered our half-sleep and torrential\
  \ rain misted through the net walls of the ship, diluting the blanket of sweat and\
  \ dirt coating our skin.  And then, just as we settled into the rhythm of our days,\
  \  it ended as unexpectedly as it began.  Our ship pulled into Iquitos in the early\
  \ morning hours, depositing us into the churn of the city's movement."
