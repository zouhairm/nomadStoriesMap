Text: "If your chosen holiday destination is Nepal no doubt you\u2019ll expect mountains.\
  \ With 1900 peaks 5500 metres above sea level and a plethora of trails through the\
  \ Himalayas, these magnificent peaks will definitely be a highlight in this unforgettable\
  \ part of the world.\n\nIf trekking, expect contrasting landscapes. Rocky barren\
  \ alps, dense jungles and endless hillside villages.  Expect satisfaction after\
  \ conquering a 7 plus  hour hike however, don't expect downhill to be easier than\
  \ uphill! Expect a snapshot into the friendly nature of the Nepali people. The restaurant,\
  \ tea house and lodging owners you meet along the way and the gorgeous children\
  \ who will walk with you on their way to or from school. \n\nTrust that you will\
  \ be mesmerised by the views in Nepal\u2026always. Paragliding over Lake Pokhara,\
  \ looking down into Kathmandu Valley from Swayambhunath Stupa or anytime you are\
  \ immersed in the 2.5 million people that call Kathmandu Valley home. \n\nWhat you\
  \ may not expect and won\u2019t forget is the industrial smell of generators that\
  \ hum day and night to compensate for the rolling power outages in Kathmandu.  Or\
  \ how dirty your nose gets at the end of each day, filled with the dust and pollution\
  \ that swirls amongst the flurry of motorbikes, cars, local buses and multi-coloured\
  \ trucks competing on the roads.\n\nI spent 9 months in Nepal and experienced the\
  \ beautiful views, visited the attractions and met many wonderful Nepali people.\
  \ However, the last thing I expected was to cultivate the wisdom of \u2018gracious\
  \ acceptance\u2019. The Nepalese sum up this wisdom with the phrase \u2018ke garne?\u2019\
  .  Literally translated it means \u2018what to do?\u2019 and it\u2019s often used\
  \ to acknowledge and accept the many challenges of life in Nepal. Countless afternoons\
  \ were spent drinking chiya (Nepali tea) and discussing these hardships. Lack of\
  \ money and opportunity, the corruption of government, pollution and the never ending\
  \ power outages. These discussions always ended with a smile, a shrug of the shoulders\
  \ and a \u2018ke garne?\u2019.  We\u2019d then continue drinking our tea and enjoying\
  \ our moment together; grateful because we still had that.\n\nNo matter why you\
  \ choose to visit Nepal learn the phrase \u2018ke garne?\u2019 Trekking, volunteering,\
  \ visiting the UNESCO heritage sites, or just experiencing daily life; expect that\
  \ Nepal will test your patience put you out of your comfort zone. Shrug your shoulders,\
  \ smile and graciously accept the situation.  Nepal is the experience of a lifetime...and\
  \ if for some reason it isn\u2019t; Ke garne!"
