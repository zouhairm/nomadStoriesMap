Text: "\u201Cwould you like a drink miss\u201D? I look up to see a flight attendant.\
  \ I nod my head \u2018yes please\u2019. My mind wanders back to my day dream. I\
  \ feel as though I\u2019m about to fall 216 meters into the unknown! I\u2019m about\
  \ to do the last thing I\u2019ve least expected to do! That is move to South Korea\
  \ to teach English. How did I even come to this decision? I\u2019ve never been a\
  \ great student I have a learning disability. This completely shattered myself confidence.\
  \ I felt as though nothing did was good enough. By the time I got to high school\
  \ I still had this belief that there were somethings that I shouldn\u2019t atment\
  \ to try, because I would fail. I did get into college, a small college in Boston.\
  \ Right before graduation I met a guy, Clayton my first boyfriend. College was nothing\
  \ like I imagined it would be. My college was a commuter school, all of my friends\
  \ left once the weekend came around. Clayton was starting to resent me for the distance.\
  \ I wanted to take a gap year and travel, figure out what I wanted to do with my\
  \ life. I didn\u2019t think that would be an option, I transferred to a school back\
  \ home. I found myself very depressed, I realized I didn\u2019t know how to make\
  \ myself happy I was isolating myself. Struggling with depression and unhealthy\
  \ relationship lasted throughout my college career, finally Clayton and I broke\
  \ up. I realized that I wasted the four years. I waste my time on an emotionally\
  \ abusive boyfriend I didn\u2019t do any of the things I wanted to do. One thing\
  \ I really couldn\u2019t get past was not studying abroad. My father travels a lot\
  \ for work, he would bring us along. I grew up wanting to explore and see things.\
  \ I knew deep down that traveling is what I wanted to do! I loved learning about\
  \ new cultures of each place we visited. I learned more from the places we traveled\
  \ to then I did all school year in a classroom. I\u2019ve seen amazing things. Snorkeling\
  \ in Hawaii, and going to the monkey forest in Bali. My sister had studied in Italy\
  \ and she taught English in France. It occurred and I\u2019m pretty sure I actually\
  \ said this outloud \u201Cwhy can\u2019t I do the same thing\u201D? So what if I\
  \ had a learning disability. I really felt like teaching was something I needed\
  \ to prove to myself. I needed to stop focusing on the past so much and start looking\
  \ at my future. I got my ESL certificate, I learned that Korea was a fun place to\
  \ teach English in. Here I am, sitting on a airplane on my way to Korea. Waitting\
  \ to do the last thing I've ever expected to do!"
