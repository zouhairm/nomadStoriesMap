Text: "Usually I sleep on planes. Silent and disengaged with the world around me.\
  \ There is nothing better than falling asleep just before takeoff and waking up\
  \ as the plane lands. However, it was not meant to be this time around. I began\
  \ my usual pre-flight routines. Find my seat, establish who is sitting next to me.\
  \ Just two of the three seats in my row were filled. A man sat down next to me.\
  \ Nothing remarkable about him, average height, glasses, black hair. We are flying\
  \ out of Thailand and into to China. I assume he is headed home. \nTraveling alone,\
  \ particularly on planes, is meditative for me. It\u2019s all in the moment, the\
  \ next objective is waiting for you every step. This trip was no exception. I began\
  \ my ritual without a second thought. Sleep time. No such luck though, sleepiness\
  \ eluded me so I resigned to be awake for this flight. Not to waste a moment I chose\
  \ to write. A poem this time, one to summarize my mood on this trip. Forward. As\
  \ it was titled and so too did time travel in just that direction.\nTo that point,\
  \ the choice to ignore one another had been mutual. This man of no consequence to\
  \ me and myself of none to him. It was the perfectly blissful disconnection all\
  \ too common in the twenty first century. How did the conversation get started?\
  \ Did he ask me for the time or did I ask him? Regardless, the barrier was broken.\
  \ Silence no longer ruled in the space between us. His name was Wei. Suddenly we\
  \ became acquainted. We were of a similar age and the comparisons did not stop there.\
  \ I discovered that Wei was on vacation alone. His girlfriend had just broken up\
  \ with him. I was having some romantic issues of my own. Seems we both were struggling\
  \ with the concept of growing up. We had related. He told me more of his life. His\
  \ parents who own a factory, the decision of either joining the family business\
  \ or striking his own mark. My own family has a strong history in the construction\
  \ industry, a history I am resisting to the last. Our lives seemed not so different\
  \ from one another. Two young men coming into their own surrounded by a swirling\
  \ mass of expectations and dying dreams.\nI shared my poem with Wei. Forward. The\
  \ title and theme. Advice we both needed just then. We agreed to connect via email\
  \ but I never could find him. It was the briefest of connections but now we both\
  \ know there is someone on the other side of the planet with the similar struggles\
  \ in life. A connection to give us both perspective."
