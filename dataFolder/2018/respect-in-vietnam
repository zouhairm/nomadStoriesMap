Text: "Someone is shaking my shoulder. I open my eyes. It's the landlord. He sees\
  \ I\u2019m awake. He doesn\u2019t speak English at all, and my Vietnamese is basic.\
  \ With signs, he explains to me I have to go downstairs. I lower the sheet a bit\
  \ to show him I\u2019m naked. He nods and goes out. I look at the clock, it's 8.30\
  \ am. What is going on? It has to be important.\nThe ground floor is similar to\
  \ all the ground floors in Vietnam. It's a big room opened onto the street, full\
  \ of bikes with a small altar in a corner. The landlord is sitting there with my\
  \ housemates and some neighbours. I say hello and I sit with them. He has a pack\
  \ of beers with him and hands me one. I thank him and shake my head. It's too early,\
  \ I need coffee, not alcohol. He insists, but I decline the offer. He turns toward\
  \ one of the neighbours and they start talking in Vietnamese. I look at my housemates.\
  \ They all look half asleep. They are all holding an opened can of beer.\nThe neighbour\
  \ explains to me the landlord is old enough to be my grandfather, I have to respect\
  \ him and drink. I ask him if it's some kind of special occasion. He shrugs and\
  \ says he wants to drink. I open the beer and clink to bottle with the others. A\
  \ big smile lights up the landlord\u2019s face. M\u1ED9t, hai, ba, v\xF4! And we\
  \ drink. Every time we finish a drink, he hands us another one. If we don\u2019\
  t drink fast enough, he looks disappointed and makes gestures at us to finish.\n\
  After a while, his pantomime changes. He wants us to drink bottoms up. I\u2019m\
  \ already tipsy, I shake my head and tell him no. He gets up, goes to a closet in\
  \ the corner of the room and comes back with a big bundle of papers. With all the\
  \ stamps and the communist star, it looks official. I don\u2019t understand and\
  \ I raise an eyebrow at the neighbour. He browses through to documents and explains\
  \ to us the landlord was a hero during the Vietnam War. We owe him respect for his\
  \ feats. The landlord hands us a new round of beers.\nIt seems he can\u2019t get\
  \ enough alcohol and he keeps handing beers to us every five minutes. I can\u2019\
  t keep drinking, it\u2019s not even noon and I\u2019m already drunk. I explain the\
  \ neighbour I have to go the toilet, but I go to my room instead. The landlord is\
  \ already calling me. I grab the Breton moonshine I keep to prepare toddies and\
  \ go back downstairs. The landlord really likes it and keeps asking me to refill\
  \ the glasses. After the 5th round, he gets up and goes to his room. A couple of\
  \ minutes later, we hear him snoring. I smile to my housemates and go to snore as\
  \ well."
