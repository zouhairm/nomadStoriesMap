Text: "It has been said 'all you have to do in life is point yourself in the direction\
  \ you want to go, and put one foot in front of the other'. Well here I am with one\
  \ foot miraculously finding itself in front of the other. From within my sodden\
  \ boots, these achilles sing to me a shrill, painful note. It's around four in the\
  \ morning and I am not a morning person. I have a case of insisted, bodily wind.\
  \ But worst of all is the polite and infrequent 'poli poli'. I don't want to walk\
  \ 'slowly slowly', I want to be off this wretched mountain side as soon as possible.\
  \ It's situations like these when I wonder WHY am I here? \n\nThis story started\
  \ in Nashville, Tennessee of all places. A younger, simpler version of myself was\
  \ marveling at the delightful taste and refreshing nature of PBR beer. Enter Dragana,\
  \ a upstart only a few years older but already a consultant at a high powered IT\
  \ firm. It was the kind of relationship where \"you wouldn't\" featured. \"You wouldn't\
  \ eat a supersized pizza in one sitting\" for example. Perhaps \"you wouldn't wear\
  \ a Jets jersey on opening night in Nashville\". But the real kicker came in the\
  \ form: \"you wouldn't climb Killamanjaro, would you?!\"\n\nOn returning home, tired\
  \ and smeared in the travel blues, I realized what I had done. Killamanjaro, which\
  \ took a six to ten day hike to conquer, was the tallest peak in Africa. At 6000m\
  \ you would be unlikely to avoid altitude sickness. No emergency services. \n\n\
  In the months leading up to the due date we had organised the flights, the safari,\
  \ the expedition crew; and taken more jabs in the arm than I cared to count. One\
  \ thing I hadn't done was pay. Dragana hadn't either. Secretly I was wondering if\
  \ she could conveniently forget about the whole thing. Then came a conversation\
  \ with my then boss that really put my nose out of joint. He said: \"I'd always\
  \ wanted to do that\". I paid those damned travel bills as soon as I got home. \n\
  \nSometimes it's easy to ask why we are here. I've been asking myself this as I\
  \ currently write my thesis. For me it happens when I am nearest to the pinnacle\
  \ of my desires. When I or those around me crumple one hundred meters from the finish.\
  \ My experience conquering that mountain with Dragana has fueled my fire ever since.\n\
  \nIf I dared contribute a 'wisdom' it would go something like this: point yourself\
  \ in a direction and find someone crazy enough to battle along with you. Don't worry\
  \ about your feet, they already know what to do."
