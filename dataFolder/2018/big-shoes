Text: "Along Ellis Quay, if you walk far enough passed the Jameson Distillery, you'll\
  \ find a little shop called \"Heathers Shoes\". I wondered into this shop on one\
  \ of my last days in Dublin - my first trip to another country. It's a lonely feeling\
  \ to be in a city by yourself when everything about you is different from those\
  \ who inhabit the place. As an African-American woman who appears masculine, I was\
  \ intimidated by how different I would appear to the average Dubliner; an obvious\
  \ tourist or an easy target is how I saw myself.\n\n Dublin in April is dreary and\
  \ gray and unremarkable to an eye that craves sunshine and vibrant beaches with\
  \ cyan blue waters. I walked for hours in a misty fog each day exposing myself to\
  \ Gothic Cathedrals and dusty pubs that smelled like stale corn and old men who\
  \ sat in corners with a pint of Guinness and watched the goofy tourist navigate\
  \ a barstool. I wanted to be those old men who observed. I walked up and down the\
  \ city looking for a place where I could fit in. \n\nHeathers Shoes sales shoes\
  \ for men with big feet. I walked in and was greeted by one of the owners as the\
  \ other rung up another customer. She smiled and said in a sing-song way, \"You've\
  \ come to the right place\". She did not question my reason for being there. She\
  \ saw that I was tall. \"What size you wear?\" She asked. I wear a twelve, men.\
  \ I was just browsing, but I didn't tell her this. She let me look around at the\
  \ varies shoes that wear displayed along the front and side windows - a pair of\
  \ black track shoes, size fourteen. A pair of brown canvas boots, size twelve. A\
  \ pair of white New Balances, size thirteen. I came across a pair of dark blue leather\
  \ dress boots with a red tab on the back. They were Catesby's, a UK brand I was\
  \ not familiar with but they looked out of place among common footwear that you\
  \ would see on the feet of varies men going to work or taking out the trash or going\
  \ for a run. She looked at me and said, \"those would fit you well.\" I bought them\
  \ for fifty U.S. dollars. The other customer, a man who looked as if he worked construction,\
  \ complimented my purchase. \"There's not many of us who can pull off big blue shoes\"\
  . \n\nOutside of the shop I looked up at the awning. \"Established in 1886\" it\
  \ said. The woman peaked her head out of the door. \"Like us on Facebook,\" she\
  \ said. It has been three years and I still marvel at the comfort of these big blue\
  \ shoes and the compliments I get from passing strangers. Let me tell you about\
  \ the time I went to Dublin alone, I say."
