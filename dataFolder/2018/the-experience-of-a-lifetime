Text: "The experience of a life time\n\nMy holiday to the friendly city of Port Elizabeth\
  \ was a fantastic experience. Having my family with me made it even more fun. With\
  \ so much to do in their beautiful beaches as well as their great malls to go shopping\
  \ around.\nMy girlfriend and I have always wanted to take a vacation together with\
  \ our son just the three of us but have always discussed different destinations\
  \ around South Africa like Durban and others but we came to a decision that we should\
  \ try out Port Elizabeth because we heard that it\u2019s called the friendly city\
  \ so we wanted to experience that type of hospitality. So it was a unanimous decisions\
  \ that Port Elizabeth it is.\nSo after packing all the relevant things that will\
  \ be needed for the holidays we headed on to our holiday destination taking a long\
  \ twelve hour trip to Port Elizabeth by bus. Unfortunately we didn\u2019t own a\
  \ car and flight tickets where a bit too expensive. So we had no choice but to endure\
  \ that long trip.\n\nConnecting with the locals\n\nUpon our arrival in Port Elizabeth\
  \ the reception was so warm from the cab drivers who approached us as we stepped\
  \ out of the bus to offer us a lift to our bed and breakfast location.\nThe landlord\
  \ at the bed and breakfast received us very well and showed us around the house\
  \ and took us into our nice and comfortable room.\nConnecting with the locals made\
  \ it as easy as Port Elizabeth is known as a friendly city. The locals are easily\
  \ approachable and are always eager to help and assist where they can. What really\
  \ impressed me the most was that everywhere you go even a stranger will greet you\
  \ who is kind of strange but it shows the warmth and friendly spirit of the people.\n\
  The fun began when we went to the boardwalk mall which has got a variety of things\
  \ to do from movies to restaurants and a kids play are with lots of rides and games.\
  \ So my son helped himself to the gaming section where he had a great time with\
  \ other kids while I and his mom spent some quality time together at the restaurant\
  \ opposite the gaming section. \nWe stayed in Port Elizabeth in for a weekend which\
  \ we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves but next time we go there we want to stay for\
  \ even more days because we really enjoyed ourselves there.\nMaking a local connection\
  \ wasn\u2019t much of a hassle as the City of Port Elizabeth is dominated by Xhosa\
  \ speaking people which made it much more convenient for me because I myself am\
  \ a Xhosa speaking.So I felt much closer and connected to the locals people"
