Text: "It was nearing 5:00PM as I walked up the route to the summit of Krist\xEDnartindar,\
  \ laughing at my intelligence.\n\n\"Mrs. Wade was right Dylan, you are a genius.\
  \ Why wouldn't you bring a 30 pound backpack, half your size, to carry 5 pounds\
  \ worth of gear up a mountain? You fucking genius.\"\n\nI had been hiking for nearly\
  \ 6 hours and my backpack felt heavy. I was tired of its fabric. A wooden sign stood\
  \ to my left that read: \"2 km to Krist\xEDnartindar\".\n\n\"Almost there\", I whispered\
  \ to myself. \"Keep going.\"\n\nAs I walked the trail, the floor below began to\
  \ change. Green vegetation turned to a dry brown and with every step it gradually\
  \ inclined further and further until it became a near vertical sea of loose gravel.\
  \ My boots barely clung to the terrain. Every step forward, I would slide two steps\
  \ back. And every time I lost my footing, a jolt of arrhythmia would spread throughout\
  \ me. Thousands of meters of jagged rocks and the certainty of injury lay beneath.\
  \ I was afraid of falling but even more afraid of turning back. \n\nA gentle trickle\
  \ of sweat whispered encouragement to my soul and as I looked up, hands clinging\
  \ to dirt, fingernails dark, I challenged the mountain to defeat me. With every\
  \ step my mind grew quiet and the weight I had been carrying lessened; both in mind\
  \ and spirit. Time lost meaning and a stillness took over me. I no longer thought\
  \ of the troubles of my existence and all it's trifles. My focus was simply on each\
  \ step, the sound of boot against old gravel and the promise of the top.  \n\nAs\
  \ I reached the end of the hike, and pulled myself up over the edge I exhaled deeply;\
  \ letting go of all that had brought me to this moment. A blanket of happiness swept\
  \ over and I felt tears in my eyes. Not a soul was near and so I let the emotions\
  \ flow, unhindered. Even though climbing this mountain was no great feat in the\
  \ eyes of history, to me; it was my life's greatest achievement. The present summit\
  \ of my own being. \n\nI saw an outcropping to my right, leaning out over the glacier\
  \ Vatnaj\xF6kull. Setting down my pack, I sat on its edge and let my legs sway hundreds\
  \ of meters above the blues and whites and blacks of the glacier lying below. I\
  \ smiled, closed my eyes, reached down and picked up a rock. I had left a piece\
  \ of myself on that mountain, and I would take a piece of it with me.\n\nThe sun\
  \ was falling and as a subtle palette of reds and yellows spread across the sky\
  \ I picked up my pack and began my climb down. It no longer felt heavy, and neither\
  \ did I."
