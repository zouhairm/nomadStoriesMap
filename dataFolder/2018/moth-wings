Text: "Feeling lost is the epitome of the college experience for most, unsure of what\u2019\
  s next, looking forward to all that is unknown. I spent the first two years of college\
  \ striving for 78% in any given nursing class. When I realized I couldn't clean\
  \ bedpans forever, I walked alone onto an airplane to fly to a place I\u2019d never\
  \ seen, armed with Cliff bars and the words \u201Cno, mesi\u201D and \u201CJezi\u201D\
  . Armed with the confidence of someone who doesn\u2019t know how little they know.\
  \ The first week in that devastating clinic, I realized I knew little of the world.\
  \ The thinnest skin I\u2019ve ever seen is the soft fuzz of an infant\u2019s skull,\
  \ and I held that skin tight as we chased the taut green line of the only possible\
  \ vein we could penetrate. The baby needed fluid or it would die. This is how the\
  \ story ends: The child died. When it happened, I stood watching the montage play\
  \ out as if from a distance. The roll of thunder in the background, the first rain\
  \ we had gotten in a month. Faded yelling, counting breaths, compressions with just\
  \ the tips of fingers on chest. \u201CHe\u2019s gone\u201D, and the slow-motion\
  \ turn of the nurse who had worked so hard to save him. The clinic was filled with\
  \ moths that night, thousands of them seeking refuge from the rain.  They lined\
  \ the ceilings and walls, tiny and iridescent in the strange darkness of the storm,\
  \ their wings like ethereal postcards from a country that was breaking my notions\
  \ of what life was meant to be. When the child was proclaimed dead, they wrapped\
  \ his body in a faded blanket. The doorway and hall filled with Haitians, family\
  \ of other children, and when the nurse spun away with her flying tears, the Haitians\
  \ streamed into the room, filling it and raising hands to Jezi. They began to sing,\
  \ drowning out the mother\u2019s sobs. My lungs seemed not to re-inflate fully after\
  \ he died, and as I left the room to bend gasping in the hall, I noticed the wings.\
  \ Thousands of wings, covering the floor and still drifting down from the ceiling.\
  \ There was no trace of the moths, just thousands of wings like petals covering\
  \ the floors, as if the moths had left them behind as they carried the child to\
  \ Jezi. I listened as the Haitians lifted the child\u2019s death up with pale-palmed\
  \ hands and words I couldn\u2019t understand, raised to heaven like a white flag.\
  \ Rain fell and washed out the red dirt streets. This wasn\u2019t a story where\
  \ anyone saves anyone, or where Jezi swoops down to raise a child to life. The only\
  \ saving I could do in this story was to tell it."
