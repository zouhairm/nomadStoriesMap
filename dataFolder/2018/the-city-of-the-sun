Text: "I dribbled my basketball into Parque Recreacional Del Norte. Curvy green stood\
  \ on the horizon. Nine friends gathered a court. I approached.\n\"Angles?\" I asked.\n\
  \"I know some English,\" the man wore a yellow Colombian James Rodriguez soccer\
  \ jersey.\n\"Down for a game?\" I asked.\n\"Qu\xE9?\" A guy with a red headband\
  \ asked. Red cradled a basketball.\nRodr\xEDguez translated the situation. The group\
  \ deliberated. \n\"You're on. First team to 21.\"\nA man sported a Los Angeles Lakers\
  \ Kobe Bryant jersey. Kobe and Red captained the teams. They bantered back-and-forth.\
  \ You didn't need Spanish fluency to recognize when pride was on the line.\nRed\
  \ drafted the tallest guy available with the first pick.\n\"Gringo,\" Kobe pointed\
  \ at me. I walked over and we bumped fists. \nWhen the draft finished, both teams\
  \ competed for every point.\nTied at 20, The game paused when a player needed to\
  \ retie his shoe. \nI panted. Sogamoso, Colombia, sits 2,569 meters above the sea.\
  \ I left my endurance in Toronto, 76 meters above sea-level.   \nThe Sun's rays\
  \ zapped my skin. I understood a different layer to why Sogamoso is called the \"\
  City of the Sun.\"\nThe game started. I drove to the basket. The defence collapsed.\
  \ I threw the ball to Kobe in the corner. He shot. The ball swished through the\
  \ net.  \nI high-fived my teammates and shook my opponents hands. \nAt the bench,\
  \ I sipped my water bottle. Kobe joined me.\n\"You're officially the Colombian Kobe\
  \ Bryant,\" I said, \"agua?\"\n\"Gracias,\" Kobe laughed, \"s\xED por favor.\"\n\
  I passed him the bottle. He drank and passed it back.\n\"Good game,\" I said. \n\
  \"Good game Gringo,\" Kobe replied.\nLater that day, I sat in Sogamoso's library.\
  \ An old man educated me about Gran Colombia. The old country once contained Ecuador,\
  \ Venezuela and other countries before it fragmented.\nI exited the library and\
  \ strolled down a thin road. I passed murals on the side of buildings. A topless\
  \ indigenous woman in a river carried her son under a golden sun.\nI arrived at\
  \ Plaza de la Villa. Bulky palm trees surrounded the plaza. An elevated monument\
  \ positioned in front of a white Catholic cathedral. Four dark Chibcha tribeswomen\
  \ bowed to a bronze sun raised on a stone column.\nMy stomach grumbled. I strode\
  \ to a restaurant down the street for empanadas, delicious pastries filled with\
  \ meat, vegetables, rice, and sometimes eggs.  \n\"Gringo,\" a voice called.\nI\
  \ turned to in a store and saw an employee with a familiar smile. \n\"Hola hermano,\"\
  \ I raised my hand to him.\nThe Colombian Kobe Bryant saluted back."
