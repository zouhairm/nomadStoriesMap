Text: "That morning I woke at 5.30am after another strange dream-riddled sleep and\
  \ sat drinking tarry coffee while making a plan to avoid the crowds at Manuel Antonio\
  \ park, Costa Rica. It was the last week of a 6 week trip to South and Central America,\
  \ and having arrived from the chaos of Panama City, I wanted to experience this\
  \ beach to myself.\nI caught the shuttle bus to the park at 8am, paid my entry and\
  \ checked the map. The fairly small park, which has some 680 hectares of rough rainforest,\
  \ white sand beaches and coral reefs, is threaded by hiking trails and so I set\
  \ out on the path to the beach, passing groups of tourists searching for sloths\
  \ in the trees. I\u2019d seen one distantly in Panama Metropolitan Natural Park\
  \ after I got caught in a tropical storm, an experience that was exciting at first\
  \ but quickly turned to a rising fear that I would be struck by lightning, and nobody\
  \ knew I was there. It was in moments like these that I realised how alone I was.\
  \ I\u2019d had the same feeling when I hiked along the jungle train tracks near\
  \ Machu Picchu, sitting alone on top of a huge boulder in the river valley - cherishing\
  \ the aloneness while wanting to share it. \nThe day before I had gone white water\
  \ rafting on the Naranjo River, and had befriended an American woman who was a writer\
  \ and meta-physical healer. She read the lines on my hands under the shade of a\
  \ palm tree and stroked my apparently strong Saturn finger and pressed my little\
  \ fingers into the other three. She said that this curvature means that I am someone\
  \ who tries to fix other people and circumstances; that I try to be who I think\
  \ everyone else wants me to be. \nThere were just two other people and three iguanas\
  \ on Manuel Antonio beach when I got there. I threw my bag down and undressed to\
  \ my swimsuit before running into the sea. Floating on my back and listening to\
  \ the clicks and whirrs of underwater life I was flooded with a sensation of absolute\
  \ acceptance. It wasn\u2019t bars, clubs, and parties that I wanted, but the unexpected\
  \ and new script of being at one with nature, alone, and the total acceptance that\
  \ these natural environments offered. Later that night, under the slow whirr of\
  \ the ceiling fan, I thought only of the unseen howler monkeys calling out there\
  \ in the humid black night. I realised that in allowing myself to forget, I had\
  \ found so much."
