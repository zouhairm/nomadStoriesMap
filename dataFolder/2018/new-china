Text: "Education for me begin in a one-room country school house in the woods of northern\
  \ Minnesota where my job in first grade was to hand pump water to bring in for the\
  \ class every morning.  I never imagined it leading me to China, chairing a delegation\
  \ seeking an exchange program between the Wuxi College of Commence and Taxation\
  \ and the community college for which I teach.  Yet, here I was in a land I never\
  \ imagined, as a boy of the forest and plains does, needing space. So, I left my\
  \ hotel just walking.  Everywhere people and high above cranes raising tall buildings\
  \ taller.  Burnt orange-colored apartments growing like crystal stalagmites in a\
  \ cave where time doesn't matter, where yesterday is tomorrow, and live stone threatens\
  \ to trap anyone who stands still.  Older buildings lie in uncollected rubble or\
  \ as dark-stained tenements asleep in the distance or hidden off shadowy alleys\
  \ always behind you if you turn quickly and look.  Intentionally forgotten or not,\
  \ perhaps in truth merely not yet sweep away by the New China in a city proudly,\
  \ as I was told by the Provincial Tax Minister that afternoon, planning to \"attract\
  \ over 1,000,000 more young people by 2021\"\u201410% . . . 3 years . . . unstoppable.\
  \  But, as I walked that evening I saw the Old China too.  The aged and \u201Cun-Englished\u201D\
  \ emerging at dusk in a sub-life of ancient commerce. . . . Fish sold from blotched\
  \ blankets set on cracked concrete.  A mom, who could have been mine half a century\
  \ ago washing dinner dishes in a rusty pan in an alley\u2014Water flowing from the\
  \ single faucet left for the poor, white soap bubbles running in the gutter\u2014\
  Two children, discarded soda bottles in hand, trying to catch the dim, yellow streetlight-reflecting\
  \ suds to make a toy. I walked, remembering my own childhood in a dream of small\
  \ me rolling a green glass Coke bottle\u2014filled with bubbles held in by a piece\
  \ of clear plastic rubber banded over the end\u2014back and forth with my little\
  \ brother in a mud puddle in our yard."
