Text: "Two beers slammed down in front of us. Foam spilled over the brim and slid\
  \ slowly down the glass to pool on the dark wooden table, worn and scratched from\
  \ years of drunken dining.\n\n\u201CAnything else?\u201D\n\nWe looked up at our\
  \ server, a Czech woman who's mouth held the slightest of smiles, hidden by a cool\
  \ stare. \n\nOur response was timid: \u201CNo thank you.\u201D\n\nBefore us passed\
  \ the flash of a blade, piercing through the bill and slamming down with a thud.\
  \ The receipt of our meal now attached to a knife standing upright between our drinks.\
  \  It was our third day in Prague. The best by far. \n \nThe day held a crisp kind\
  \ of cold, instilling energy rather than the impulse to hibernate, so we spent our\
  \ day walking the streets. We started in Old Town, crossed Charles Bridge, climbed\
  \ the stone steps to Lobkowicz Palace, and ended at U Kr\xE1le Brabantsk\xE9ho,\
  \ a medieval tavern and one of the oldest pubs in Prague. \n\nHaving paid our bladed\
  \ bill, we exited into the frozen air. Our plan was to visit the Jewish Museum,\
  \ so we hopped on the metro and zipped across the Vltava River, finding the buildings\
  \ closed for Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. However a small sign on the Spanish\
  \ Synagogue\u2019s door invited the public in for services. We decided to stay.\
  \ \n\nThe space felt imposing as the hall opened to an ornate altar and high ceilings\
  \ of vaulted gold. Seven people greeted us. Such a small group could make a room\
  \ feel empty but the space held the echoes of \u201CHappy Hanukkah!\u201D, as if\
  \ they were waiting all day just for us. Soon we were singing songs, blessing the\
  \ wine and sharing jelly donuts, a Hanukkah treat.\n\nWhen it came time to light\
  \ the candles, a silence fell and all was still. Voices singing Hebrew hymns began\
  \ to fill the space, and though the hall could fit over a hundred people, we nine,\
  \ standing near the flames, flooded the synagogue with holiday warmth. It was in\
  \ this moment the neighborhood came alive and I was acutely aware of the ground\
  \ we stood on. The stones beneath us held a history of violence, pain, persecution\
  \ and suffering. Prague's past was not always kind to it's Jewish citizens yet here\
  \ they stood, so few, praying with strangers. The synagogue seemed to brighten with\
  \ the candles, alive in song.\n\nOur new friends kept the spirit of the night for\
  \ future strangers to sing, share and be welcomed in from the cold. \n\nWe left\
  \ with gifts: a bag of jelly donuts, a half bottle of wine and a sense of history\
  \ no guide book could give."
