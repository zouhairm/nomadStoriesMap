Text: "My trip to Yunnan was an escape. Just before turning 30 I was unhappy about\
  \ where my life was headed and I needed to replenish soul and mind before making\
  \ some big decisions. The Tibetan Plateau seemed like the optimal choice.\n\nI decided\
  \ to visit the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, but at the top (via cablecar) I was disappointed\
  \ by the thick fog that prevented me from seeing any of the scenery. I was at 3800m,\
  \ surrounded by clouds, with no view. Great. Nevertheless, I embarked on my hike\
  \ to visit an isolated Buddhist monastery, when, at the very start, I encountered\
  \ a frail looking woman. She was adorned with Tibetan jewellery, a warm toothless\
  \ smile, a brass pipe in one hand, and a white flower in the other. A Tibetan Plateau\
  \ pixie. The flower in her hand was a rare regional specimen, whose tea rids the\
  \ body of all sorts of toxins. Coincidently it would also rid my wallet of several\
  \ hundred yuan, so I decided to fight my inner toxins another day and I politely\
  \ declined her offer of sale.\n\nWhen I asked her in my broken Mandarin about Tibetan\
  \ Plateau horticulture, she explained how each plant is part of the universe's harmony\
  \ and she thanks them for their sacrifice when she collects them. \u201CWe need\
  \ to have empathy and consideration for all living things, as we are all one.\u201D\
  \ I agreed wholeheartedly with her spiritual lesson. Then she chuckled and pointed\
  \ at a tall yellow flower in front of me. \u201CI'll teach you a Chinese saying.\u201D\
  \ We walked over and I noticed some mud at the bottom. \u201CThat\u2019s yak dung,\u201D\
  \ she said. I was disgusted but intrigued at the same time. \u201CIn Chinese \u2018\
  a flower stuck into a pile of bovine dung\u2019 means\u2026\u201D And at that exact\
  \ moment my Mandarin language antennae shut down - I didn\u2019t understand a word\
  \ she said. Still, I sheepishly smiled and agreed with her. I picked up the words\
  \ 'beauty' and 'ugly' and interpreted it as \u201Cfrom something ugly, beauty can\
  \ grow\u201D. An apt life lesson relating to my current situation. That yak dung\
  \ was fate.\n\nI thanked the Tibetan Plateau pixie and continued my hike in the\
  \ fog. I encountered the yaks, the isolated monastery, and a lake with exceptionally\
  \ blue water due to its algae. Despite the lack of scenery at the top, rugged and\
  \ mystical Jade Dragon Snow Mountain restored me both physically and spiritually,\
  \ giving me the strength to face my troubles once back home. There, I also double-checked\
  \ the bovine dung saying. It actually means 'a beautiful woman marrying an ugly\
  \ man\u2019. I didn't care. That yak dung was still fate."
