Text: "The Gray Whale first sailed to New York from its Swedish birthplace in the\
  \ 1970s. It then made its way to its second owner Mike in San Francisco. In 1982\
  \ Mike and wife Laima sailed the 32-foot sloop from San Francisco to Cairns, Australia\
  \ where it has since called home.\n\nI was fortunate enough to meet Mike and Laima\
  \ after stumbling into their Gray Whale Anchor Inn on an R&R pit stop before riding\
  \ west into the Northern Territory. Amidst an ocean of accommodation options in\
  \ this bustling tourist town, this felt like home\u2026for a few days anyhow.\n\n\
  I had been on the road for a few months when I arrived in Cairns, having mostly\
  \ camped rough. You see, I\u2019d recently decided to condense my life into a motorcycle-sized\
  \ home and circumnavigate this extraordinary country of mine. Yep, I would ride\
  \ solo around Australia. It was my Mt Everest.\n\nMike and Laima were like those\
  \ neighbours you\u2019ve had for twenty years, just like family and full of conversation\
  \ and warmth (a real treat when so far from home). Arriving on my Yamaha Tenere\
  \ 660 adventure bike \u2013 packed to its limits and covered in dirt \u2212 attracted\
  \ the attention of Mike. My first introduction to Mike was his great welcoming smile\
  \ beaming down on me from the veranda as I removed my helmet.\n\nMike had his own\
  \ stories to tell of traversing this very countryside in the 1950s on a Triumph\
  \ TR5 Trophy. A very different place, Mike lamented, especially for the change in\
  \ law at the time requiring you to wear a helmet. He spoke of helmets with such\
  \ verbal and visible disdain it was difficult to take him seriously. But serious\
  \ he was, which endeared him to me all the more.\n\nMike, 83 years of age, grew\
  \ up in Czechoslovakia during the German occupation and Communist rule. He emigrated\
  \ to the US at twenty years of age where he made California his home for thirty\
  \ years before permanently relocating to Australia in 1982. Mike is a quintessential\
  \ Aussie, through and through, and can be found in every corner of this paradoxical\
  \ land. I could have stayed on forever.\n\nOut on his sloop three times a week,\
  \ Mike also races in local amateur competitions. Occasionally he\u2019ll take guests\
  \ out for a trip, not for money but because he loves sailing and people. So, of\
  \ course I jumped at the opportunity. It was my first time sailing and was a wondrous\
  \ experience. \n\nBack on my bike, I started fantasising about embarking on my own\
  \ sailing adventure\u2026a new kind of freedom just awaiting its helmsman. People\
  \ have that effect on me when I\u2019m travelling."
