Text: "I\u2019ve been a tourist before. But this was this first time I was a traveler.\
  \ It was a Saturday morning in Mumbai. 6.07 am. The sun has risen. And Priya was\
  \ already waiting. Uh-oh. She\u2019s a stickler for time. I looked around. No sign\
  \ of Maggie. Phew. At least I wasn\u2019t the last one to arrive. Maggie was probably\
  \ still telling a few white lies to get permission for this trip.\n\nWhere were\
  \ we going? No clue. But in half an hour, the 3 of us were on a ferry heading towards\
  \ Alibaug. A few hours and an ST bus later, we stepped into Murud - home to one\
  \ of Maharashtra\u2019s greatest forts. The roads were laced with coconut trees.\
  \ A beach on the horizon. And a cool breeze played with my hair. Hello, vacay! We\
  \ walked for a while scouting for budget stays and ended up sealing a sweet deal\
  \ at Padma Lodge. 500 bucks a night. For all 3. And did I mention its beach-facing\
  \ balcony? \n\nWe dropped our bags, got into nylon and went straight for the beach.\
  \ The sand was tanned. The water had a melody. And the sun was setting while we\
  \ splish-splashed. It was starting to look like a post-card on an airport stand.\
  \  \n\nAfter freshening up, we went over to our balcony, and to our surprise, found\
  \ a 50-something German bloke sitting there with his bottle of wine. We introduced\
  \ ourselves and turns out, both our rooms share this balcony. Phew. It wasn\u2019\
  t a funny break-in. We hit it off rather well and ended up dining together at a\
  \ local restaurant called Anand Sea View (Must Go). \n\nCome morning, we were waiting\
  \ to board a sail boat. The Janjira Fort, built in the 17th Century, was in the\
  \ middle of the sea! A young chap filled the boat with around 10 of us and we were\
  \ off. He changed sails with such ease that the choppy water no longer mattered.\
  \ The entrance to the Janjira Fort was designed in a way that it can be spotted\
  \ only from 40 mtrs away. Amazing right? Till today, it remains largely intact.\
  \ The fort\u2019s peculiar grey stone walls, rooftop canons and open baths are its\
  \ distinguishing features. We walked around admiring the architectural aesthetics\
  \ and stunning view and before we knew it, it was time to bid farewell. \n\nWe were\
  \ on the sail boat again. But this time, the 15 minute ride had already turned into\
  \ a 45 minute one. Uh-oh. We had a bus to take back to Mumbai. We reach the bus\
  \ stop, and uh-oh, we missed it. Just as we were checking how low our funds were\u2026\
  we spotted a truck. Three thumbs up and I was doing the last thing I expected. I\
  \ was hitch-hiking back to Mumbai. On a Truck."
