Text: "I'm finally in Bosnia, \nMy phone just broke and now I really feel free to\
  \ explore.\nA few weeks ago, in the library, I found a book about the war in Yugoslavia.\n\
  I couldn\u2019t help falling in love with it, and today I watch myself wandering\
  \ around a place that last month probably, I didn\u2019t accurately check on the\
  \ map.\n\nWho knows how many times, that smoking man at the end of the street, would\
  \ have left from this point on the map. \nVery often, I wonder how much life, suffering,\
  \ love, I ideally collect under the fingertip of my index, while I trace the itineraries\
  \ of my trips.\nHowever, I have the impression that Bosnia - Herzegovina doesn\u2019\
  t care about the details: probably that man who slowly smokes at the end of the\
  \ street, he never asked a thing.\nPerched on these heights without identity, he\
  \ gives way to the slowness of the day that become like any other, and during a\
  \ warm summer, in his old wrecked terrace, he lets me look at him.\n\nGrenades.\n\
  \nI learned it\u2019s about grenades: they pierce and pulverize concrete like it\
  \ was made of glass, they draw confused geometries and indefinite perimeters wherever\
  \ they fall. \nThey eviscerate high as giants palaces, in a few seconds they make\
  \ the future, past.\nWho knows if the man who smokes there, has not consciously\
  \ decided to devote his entire life to the details. \nIsn\u2019t all the world's\
  \ pain, concentrated in this wound of the wall?\n\nThen I knew him.\nSteno had blue\
  \ eyes: he hugged me hard in front of his favorite pastry, and made me promise to\
  \ come back soon. \n\"In Sarajevo you will always have a friend, djevoj\u010Dica!\"\
  \ he told me.\n\nWe visited his city and I stopped for a long time next to one of\
  \ Sarajevo's roses.\nThe scars that the war left on this city\u2019s face are called\
  \ this way.\nOn a nearby wall, an incomprehensible plate reported a date that was\
  \ so clear to me: May 1992.\n\nIn May 1992 bombings began in Sarajevo.\nIn May 1992,\
  \ on the other side of the Adriatic Sea, I simply was born.\n\nI like the coincidences,\
  \ the books found in the library, the old smokers at the end of the street.\nIn\
  \ Sarajevo I celebrated humanity, life: mine and that of those who, while not forgetting,\
  \ were able to move forward among those roses of May that now make sense to me."
