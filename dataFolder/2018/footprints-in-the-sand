Text: "Wind and salt spray slashed across my face as El Astuto raced through the waters\
  \ along the north side of Cozumel.\n Diving the north side of the island was highly\
  \ uncommon for recreational divers, as it was not a marine park protected by the\
  \ Mexican government. Without a local, it was nearly impossible to find dive sites,\
  \ and with the current being stronger it made diving significantly more dangerous.\n\
  \ \u201CAlright everybody, listen up!\u201D Flash yelled over the roar of the boat\
  \ engine. He had been our guide for the past week, showing us the south side of\
  \ the island. When we had expressed interest in diving the north side, he reluctantly\
  \ offered to take us there. He pulled a rashguard over his head to protect his already\
  \ sun-darkened skin. \u201CWe\u2019re coming up on the site. Gear up, and empty\
  \ your BCD\u2019s. I don\u2019t want anyone floating at the surface. Drop to the\
  \ bottom, and wait for my signal. You linger, you get back on the boat, understood?\u201D\
  \n We nodded and geared up, making sure tanks were open, weights were in, and masks\
  \ and fins were on.\n \u201CStay close to the dropoff; If you stray, the current\
  \ will rip you out into the open water. Pay attention.\u201D My heart picked up\
  \ a little speed.\n The boat slowed, but did not stop as it had done diving at the\
  \ park. Flash grinned. \u201CThis is it! Let\u2019s go!\u201D\n He stepped off the\
  \ moving boat and disappeared into the frothy blue waters. One by one we followed\
  \ as quick as we could, terrified of being left behind.\n The water hit my entire\
  \ body as I stepped off the boat, welcoming me into it\u2019s cool embrace. Sinking\
  \ to the bottom, I immediately noticed a difference. The south side of the island\
  \ had been vibrant, colorful, and teeming with life. You could hear it ticking and\
  \ crackling all around you. Here it was silent, as if the ocean itself was holding\
  \ its breath.\n Mankind\u2019s footprint was all over this place. The current pulled\
  \ us at an alarming rate across the reef. Past it, there was nothing but a wide\
  \ expanse of blue. Below us, fish darted away, hiding in or behind rocks. Bare rocks\
  \ and sand glared up where corals used to thrive. Every now and then, we saw a Coke\
  \ bottle or a Budweiser can. \n It was astounding, how just a few miles south there\
  \ was a completely different ecosystem, whereas here, it had been abandoned by the\
  \ very hands that destroyed it.\n We surfaced. The only sound once again the roar\
  \ of the engine and the clinking of cans and bottles Flash had picked up down there.\
  \ Silence filled the air, as there was nothing to be said."
