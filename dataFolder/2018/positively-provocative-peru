Text: "Flying into the former capital of the Incan Empire positioned me over 11,000\
  \ feet above sea level. Ideally I would take the coveted Incan Trail to Machu Picchu\
  \ but time was not on my side. Around Cusco, spectacular Spanish architecture still\
  \ stands strong with unbelievable local cuisine served around every corner. I was\
  \ fascinated how many Peruvian elders still dressed themselves in cultural, vibrant\
  \ colors that accentuated perfectly braided, jet black hair flowing from underneath\
  \ hats. I had the feeling Cusco hadn't changed since colonial times. \n\nSunrise\
  \ on the next day in Ollantaytambo exposed a plethora of carefully crafted ruins\
  \ surrounding the area...one of Peru's preserved Incan communities. When the train\
  \ departed, the excitement of experiencing Machu Picchu was too strong to contain.\
  \ I didn't fight the child-like joy. Clear skies let the sun shine on this perfect\
  \ piece of Incan engineering. It's impossible to recreate the magnitude of its presence.\n\
  \nThe ruins of Sacsayhuaman and Tambomachay boast impeccable engineering bound strong\
  \ hundreds of years. Considering a lack of technological assets, it's pretty amazing\
  \ what the Incans were able to accomplish.\n\nAround the Plaza de Armas is a roaring\
  \ chatter of local children and a beating drum. Today was Warachikuy, an Andean\
  \ cultural heritage holiday ceremony where tested young boys could receive the official\
  \ status of being a man. Peruvians packed the streets to watch groups of extravagantly\
  \ costumed boys embrace their culture.\n\nNot to be missed is the rustic village\
  \ of Chinchero, famous for its Sunday market and panoramic views across the Sacred\
  \ Valley of the Incas. I walked the peaceful cobblestone streets lined with mud\
  \ brick houses. Women sold colorful wool and alpaca attire...it was cold there.\
  \ The seventeenth century church built upon an Incan foundation maintained a beautifully\
  \ designed interior.\n\nThe journey continued south to experience Lake Titicaca's\
  \ floating islands. Puno is the lakeside town I chose. The indigenous peoples livelihood\
  \ is supported by bundled totora reeds, each layer sustained by the dense roots.\
  \ As the layers rot away, residents frequently relay the surface to stay afloat.\n\
  \nA perplexing life to sustain but self-governance and tax free privileges have\
  \ kept them here for nearly 500 years. People seemed genuinely happy, especially\
  \ a young girl fascinated by my beard. We made a nice connection and although she\
  \ was yanking hairs from my face, she was just too cute to stop."
