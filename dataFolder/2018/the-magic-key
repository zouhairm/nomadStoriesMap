Text: "Being gay can be a magic key, especially when you're travelling. The key turns\
  \ and suddenly you're meeting people: it can bridge some of the differences between\
  \ you and people from another culture. You have your sexuality in common, and your\
  \ sense of living outside the mainstream: that can be enough to build a fast friendship.\
  \ That's what happened to us in Phnom Penh.\nIt took us a while to settle into the\
  \ Cambodian capital. This was partly due to the travel advisories we'd read, all\
  \ of which laboured the danger of theft there: we spent our first day in the city\
  \ with our bags clutched defensively to our sides. It's grottier than Hanoi, and\
  \ not as distinctive visually: the Western influence is more pronounced, which makes\
  \ it look more like other places. That openness to external influence also reflects\
  \ an environment that's more relaxed \u2013 more liberal \u2013 than Vietnam. The\
  \ Phnom Penh Post publishes criticisms of the government that would be unthinkable\
  \ in the Vietnamese papers. There were art openings and film screenings \u2013 a\
  \ real sense of buzz, of a multiplicity of voices. The visibility of the gay culture\
  \ stood out to me too: there were bars with rainbow flags displayed unambiguously\
  \ in their windows. In Vietnam the scene had been almost invisible. Ben and I never\
  \ felt uncomfortable there, but people's assumptions about our relationship imposed\
  \ a certain discretion. It was a relief to arrive somewhere where we were recognised\
  \ as a couple.\nOur first encounter took place in a trendy caf\xE9 on Street 240.\
  \ (The streets in Phnom Penh are numbered: even numbers for the streets running\
  \ east to west, odd for north to south.) There were two people beside us conferring\
  \ over coffee: they would not have looked out of place in a Melbourne laneway. When\
  \ Ben and I were leaving, one of them leaned over and handed me his card. He'd opened\
  \ a laneway bar nearby: he invited us to drop by. We took him up on his invitation:\
  \ up a winding flight of stairs into a space elegantly furnished with recycled timber.\
  \ Our host sat with us all night. He seemed emblematic of the city we were getting\
  \ to know: its exciting sense of activity, its design sensibility, its hospitality.\
  \ The bar we were sitting in was not his only enterprise; he also made clothes and\
  \ was outfitting the shop space below to sell them in. The meeting we'd witnessed\
  \ that morning was about a second bar he's opening around the corner. We'd been\
  \ afforded a glimpse into everyday Phnom Penh, and it was thanks to the magic key."
