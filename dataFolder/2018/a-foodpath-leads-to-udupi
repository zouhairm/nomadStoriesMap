Text: "The train reached the destination, 20 minutes before the time. My co-passenger\
  \ on train, Mutthukrishnan asked me, \u201Cdo you know where the famous Rawa idli\
  \ and Neer dosa come from\"? I was paused for a while as I didn't have answer to\
  \ that.\n\nHis protruding eyes are waiting for the reply, but I am not in a mood\
  \ to do that. I started staring outside the window. The view was mesmerizing, as\
  \ I was crossing through Konkan railways, full of never ending tunnels, spectacular\
  \ backwaters and the sheer richness of region between Western Ghats and coast. A\
  \ Bengali family next to my berth was busy collecting all the necessary information\
  \ about famous \"Mangalorean sea food\".\n\n\u201CWe are born to eat\u201D, once\
  \ remarked by my Granny, indeed, and I found my whole childhood revolve around touring\
  \ new places, meeting people and witnessing customs etc, primarily to satisfy the\
  \ taste buds. So, food remains central theme for debate, discussion & engagement\
  \ always.\n\nFood is influenced by both internal and external factors and it surpasses\
  \ every boundary. And food comes natural to me to get connected with the locals.\
  \ My sojourn to the small southern coastal town - Udupi was unique in this regard.\
  \ The beach was clean & magnetic, full of vibes and a special day for the locals\
  \ who come here to take a holy dip. The sun was unbeatable in the wintery month\
  \ of December. I stopped by a shadow, a boy came from whom I have bought something\
  \ but forgot to take away. I thanked him for that, he said, \x93Glad to see your\
  \ curiosity, sir and we shared smile blatantly. He offered his help in knowing the\
  \ place more and I said yes, of course!  \n\nThe place was full of colors, twilight\
  \ & daziness are creating the magical effect. The feast is ready to serve, as the\
  \ occasion is special. The mouthwatering Konkani sea food with enrich spices with\
  \ hell lot of coconut is telling a story, which I am interested to listen to. Amidst\
  \ these I had a chat with few women, whom I found well aware about the outside world\
  \ and verse in financial literacy, something quite unique, as it coincides with\
  \ the fact that this is the \"home\" to many notable banking institutions & the\
  \ famous \"Pai community\", which in this respect is unique to this region only.\
  \ The connection in both ideational and material terms was so profound that I found\
  \ it easy to give the comfort of my booked hotel room. Foggy dawn with peeping sunlight\
  \ is enough to wake me. A new day has begun, and I have to get ready to fit into\
  \ other chapter of this beautiful story."
