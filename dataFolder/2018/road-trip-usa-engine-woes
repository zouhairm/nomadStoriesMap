Text: "The dream on many, a road trip across the mighty US of A. We were to take 90\
  \ days getting from Los Angeles to New York. To facilitate this, we made a purchase\
  \ of a 1999 Ford Explorer, naming him \u201CDennis\u201D after the charismatic gentleman\
  \ who sold us the car with the hope that the car wouldn\u2019t turn out to be a\
  \ dodgy old bastard, as we expected human Dennis was.\n\nHeading north from Los\
  \ Angeles, we reached the stunning state of Washington. Not yet a month into our\
  \ trip, Dennis began to betray signs of weakness. The check engine light was on.\
  \ \n\nPulled over at a gas station, my travel companion and I popped the hood, only\
  \ to stare vacantly into a jumble of whats-its, hoping that the issue would magically\
  \ present itself to us in an obvious way. Luckily, it did not take long for the\
  \ sight of two women peering into a car\u2019s engine to illicit a response from\
  \ the friendly locals of Easton, Washington. Within minutes a woman, introducing\
  \ herself as Jenny, had wondered over, claiming to have a mechanic friend, who would\
  \ have a look at the car for us. On a \u201Cdental floss\u201D budget, this was\
  \ far too good an opportunity to pass up.\n\nShe sat and chatting with us in a stock\
  \ yard whilst her friend looked over the engine, afterwards inviting us to her place\
  \ for a coffee. Her demountable office was across the road from the gas station\
  \ and she made a living by providing holistic advice and healing chakras. Over a\
  \ cup of very black, very strong \u201Corganic\u201D coffee, Jenny held our hands\
  \ praising serendipity, for she had been running late to work, and if she had been\
  \ on time, she never would have seen us.\n\nIn the spirit of fate, Jenny offered\
  \ one of us a free chakra reading. I looked on at a situation that would normally\
  \ send me into fits of laughter. Here were two fully-grown women, one standing over\
  \ the other running her hands through an invisible space over the other, twitching\
  \ and humming to herself yet there was something about the humble kindness of Jenny\
  \ that made it a connecting experience, even for a cynic such as I. Here we were\
  \ in a strange place with no friends and a stranger had made us feel welcome and\
  \ at home, offering the little she had to make sure we were safe and happy. It was\
  \ in that moment that I knew why I couldn\u2019t shake the travel bug. It was the\
  \ people along the way that had been making my experiences so rich. \n\nAfter an\
  \ hour of chakra healing, Jenny saw us safely off and the engine light never came\
  \ on again."
