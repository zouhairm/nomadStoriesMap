Text: "\u201CMan plans, God laughs.\u201D The laughter never roared as strongly as\
  \ it did across the Icelandic terrain this past winter.\n\nIt was close to 5:00pm,\
  \ and the sun had already bowed out to make room for the moon, but the moon shied\
  \ away behind the snowstorm descending from the previously cloudy sky. I convinced\
  \ myself that it didn\u2019t matter that I could no longer see out the window of\
  \ the Flybus because I was on my way to the airport and I will be home soon, avoiding\
  \ the storm altogether. I had just spent three adventure-filled days in Iceland,\
  \ partaking in tourist activities, like lava-caving in the Vigdelmir cave, gazing\
  \ in awe at the wondrous stops of the Golden Circle, and watching life\u2019s stresses\
  \ evaporate away with the steam released from the Blue Lagoon. \n\nI was pushing\
  \ through the surprisingly massive crowd at the airport when I looked up to find\
  \ the word \u201CCANCELLED\u201D plastered across the announcement screens. That\
  \ looming blizzard managed to derail every single flight out of Keflavik. After\
  \ the initial spike in stress hormones, I realized I could turn this to my advantage.\
  \ I had not managed to catch a glimpse of the aurora borealis, and this could be\
  \ my chance to do so. \nThe closest lodging I located for my extended stay was in\
  \ Grindavik, a small, quiet fishing town. It's known only, if at all, for its proximity\
  \ to the Blue Lagoon, but like the rest of Iceland, it hosts a series of breathtaking\
  \ views, particularly at spots where sea meets land. The storm lingered into the\
  \ night so I stayed indoors, mingling with the other stranded tourists at the Lagafell\
  \ guesthouse. We bonded over our situation as we devoured a home-cooked meal we\
  \ had prepared together. \n\nThe last thing I expected was how much this detour\
  \ would push me towards a greater appreciation of the hidden gems of the earth and\
  \ society of the past. I went for a hike to explore the shore and walked into a\
  \ trail of shipwrecks. An entire stretch of the peninsula was lined with rusty wreckage\
  \ dating back to the 1800s, and at the end of the trail was the Hopsnes lighthouse,\
  \ radiating its bright orange color to signal its presence. There was much more\
  \ exploration to do in this historically rich town, but I had to return to the guesthouse\
  \ and prepare for the hike into isolation to capture the beauty of the Northern\
  \ Lights. It was 10:00pm when I settled on a spot from which to stare upwards, and\
  \ I awaited Mother Nature\u2019s presentation that would make the small detour into\
  \ Grindavik all the more pleasurable."
