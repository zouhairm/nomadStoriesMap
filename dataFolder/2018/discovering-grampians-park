Text: "A day spent in the mountains at Grampians National Park went nothing as planned.\n\
  \nFirst, we couldn\u2019t find any good track, then got caught by rainy showers...\
  \ finally we decided to hide ourselves in the rocks, where  was nothing but spiders\
  \ \U0001F626\n\nThe time was passing, but  before coming back to the lake Wartook\
  \ to spend second night at the camping, Paul decided to have the last ride along\
  \ the Grampians mountains.\n\nThe weather was humid and the air heavy, so I felt\
  \ asleep in the car.\n\nI woke up after maybe 30 minutes, because of all this shaking\u2026\
  \ and saw by the window we were on the road littered by stones\u2026 600 m above\
  \ the ground, and the car was dancing so much because of all the little rocks, just\
  \ at the edge !!!!\n\nIt was probably the craziest moment during this trip. After\
  \ driving to the top of the mountain and then downhill at the opposite side, we\
  \ found the information  board saying that the track  was closed for driving.. Happily\
  \ the only reason why it was excluded from the movement was because the track has\
  \ been a little bit neglected.. I mean there were no holes or impassable moments..\
  \ cause once we got on this way, there was no turning back and luckily we got to\
  \ the end of the road without any problems (just a little bit shaken up)\n\n Next\
  \ day driving all along the coast, after this little adventure inside of Grampians\
  \ Park, were very calm almost boooring.. \U0001F642  but offered us  many incredible\
  \ views and colorful landscapes of Australia \U0001F642"
