Text: "The mud squelched beneath our feet as we powered up the hill through the temple\
  \ of trees. I squealed as I slipped, skidding to a halt as I held my arms out for\
  \ balance. The others glanced at me, and I smiled, reassuring them that I was okay.\
  \ My calves ached, and my walking boots were brown instead of black, but my stomach\
  \ buzzed with warmth. No matter how much my legs complained I was going to drag\
  \ them through the mud. \nThe river next to us flowed farther and farther away as\
  \ we walked. Sweat dripped through my shirt. The river\u2019s small waves splashed\
  \ into my awaiting bed, and my tongue teased my lips, spreading its moisture. No,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t just jump in. I wanted to see animals that weren\u2019t separated\
  \ from me by barbed wire. I jerked my head away and continued after the others.\n\
  \nThe sun beat down on us as we continued our trek, but my feet rooted to the ground\
  \ as we came across a wide wooden plank bridge across a stream below. It was smothered\
  \ in mud, and I gulped in unease. As everyone slid their way across, I stared at\
  \ the clamouring stream, my courage draining. What if I slipped and fell into the\
  \ river? That would be okay if it weren\u2019t for my backpack clinging to me, treasuring\
  \ my phone and lunch. When the bridge to my death lay clear, I took a meagre step\
  \ on it. The wood didn\u2019t budge, but my leg did. It slid an inch, and I squealed\
  \ and jumped back. I tried again, this time with one of the interns lending me a\
  \ hand. He was like a rock as I grabbed him for support, sliding across like it\
  \ was an ice rink. My boots heavy with mud, I heaved them to safety, sighing with\
  \ relief. \nWe continued through the otherwise picturesque sanctuary of the forest,\
  \ coming across lots of fuzzy, colourful caterpillars and yellow-and-black flying\
  \ bugs that I recoiled from. It turned out they were harmless, \n\nA jingling of\
  \ bells struck my ears. I bent my neck forward, squinting through the labyrinth\
  \ of leaves, bamboo and bark to spot any sign of grey. There was a tiny speck, growing\
  \ larger as it stomped closer, his mahout guiding him with care. Now in front of\
  \ us, the elephant snorted and stretched out his trunk, using it as a hand as he\
  \ seized one banana after another, shovelling them down in a hunger I\u2019ve never\
  \ witnessed. My eyes widened, and I squeaked like a child. The next time he grabbed\
  \ my bananas, I seized the opportunity to stroke him. His skin rubbed mine, hard\
  \ and bumpy and prickled with hairs. Covered in as much mud as he was, I was as\
  \ free as him. We were the same."
