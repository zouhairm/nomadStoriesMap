Text: "It\u2019s a hot, slightly hung-over Friday morning in Tiberias, when we step\
  \ into our inexplicably cheap rental car. It\u2019s Shabbath, meaning a nearly complete\
  \ stop of all daily activities from Friday to Saturday eve. Fascinating, but after\
  \ two weeks we are still not used to the omnipresence of Jewish orthodox people.\
  \ Even the presence of gun-carrying military youth seems easier to get accustomed\
  \ to. In order to escape probing stares for a day, we plan a tour around Lake Tiberias,\
  \ the lowest freshwater lake on Earth that owes its grandeur to the steps Jesus\
  \ walked on its glassy surface. We get drowsy from the pressing heat and arid hills\
  \ with yellow shrubs are about all we register. Bright billboards don\u2019t catch\
  \ our attention anymore and we look at Hebrew road signs the same way we look at\
  \ street art. Two stops are planned. A -secret- refreshing Jordan river waterfall\
  \ and some me-time on a small beach. We double-check the directions so generously\
  \ supplied by our hostel and soon we park close to a small fence door in a concrete\
  \ wall covered in ivy defiantly holding on to life. Unprepared as we are, we quickly\
  \ change into our bikini\u2019s behind some trees in a fruit plantation. Expecting\
  \ an oasis of the rarest tranquillity, ferociously fluttering butterflies and cool\
  \ chicken skin water at the end of the walk, we are surprised to find a waterfall\
  \ which is rather popular for a \u2018secret\u2019 spot, to say the least. We have\
  \ to wriggle through the crowd, elbows as oars. It seems that our getaway safe-space\
  \ is a well-known retreat for orthodox Jewish families. Secret, not so much! Men,\
  \ with their black hats and pipe curls next to their ears, are now wearing colourful\
  \ long robes. Women seem to find their cool in smaller puddles while getting splashed\
  \ by children. Prying eyes scrutinize our pervert clothes and we promptly decide\
  \ to leave this heavenly but cramped paradise of refreshment. We hurry to destination\
  \ number two. This time we come prepared. \u201CAll covered and no skin to show?\
  \ Aye!\u201D A sandy road takes us through dangling willows and increasing humidity.\
  \ We hear music, bells, laughter?! As we round the last bush of bamboo-like shoots\
  \ we find ourselves in a replicate of the Garden of Eve. The same Jordan river is\
  \ now overflowing with freedom embracing mermaids topped off with a picture perfect\
  \ rainbow. Men wear kippahs on top of voluptuous dreads. Woman have golden bracelets\
  \ and one boob bouncing freely. They seem hypnotized, dancing with divine grace.\
  \ We are way overdressed!"
