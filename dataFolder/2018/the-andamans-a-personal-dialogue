Text: "When I land at Port Blair, I come expecting a leisurely holiday in sun-soaked\
  \ picture-postcard beaches and an ocean in many shades of blue. True to that promise,\
  \ the beaches offer me breathtaking beauty and solitude. Right from launching off\
  \ from one in a glass-bottomed boat to view a stunning colony of corals underwater,\
  \ to experiencing a beach painted over by precise and tiny marks created by crabs\
  \ digging up sand, spiraling across and across, without an inch to spare, to another\
  \ where the waters part to allow me to walk across the sand bar separating two islands\
  \ which dissolve into each other at high tide, each offers a memento to remember\
  \ it by.   \nPeople are also equally fascinating. The forests on either side of\
  \ the Andaman Trunk Road is home to the tribal Jarwa community, caught as they are\
  \ between our world and theirs. I see groups of Jarwa women standing bare-breasted,\
  \ the sun glistening on their faces and arms, palms outstretched to receive a gift\
  \ from the \u201Ccivilized\u201D world.           \nThings, however, start shifting\
  \ the day I visit the Cellular Jail. In British India, the worst offenders were\
  \ sailed across to these islands, over the \u201Cblack waters\u201D, or kaala paani,\
  \ and shut away within the unforgiving walls of the jail. They never returned home.\
  \ It had been a 135-minute flight for me from the mainland to here. I start being\
  \ haunted by a question that cracks me open, leaving me raw and vulnerable.  How\
  \ long would their journey have been? \nI think I will always remember the islands\
  \ with this awareness, as a place and people who had been extraordinarily brave,\
  \ once then, and once more than five decades later, when the ocean became a 49 feet-\
  \ high death goddess and swallowed them whole.  \nTowards the end of the trip, one\
  \ day I am taking an evening walk by the sea. It is the 26th of January, the day\
  \ India became a sovereign socialist republic. Ships have been set afloat on the\
  \ dark waters, glittering all over with tiny yellow lights to mark the occasion.\
  \ It feels like a silent tribute to all the people whose lives these islands have\
  \ witnessed over hundreds of years. \nToday, perched at Mount Harriet, the highest\
  \ point in the islands, I see another lit-up ship far, far away in the ocean. I\
  \ cannot make out where land ends, nor where the ocean begins \u2013 it\u2019s all\
  \ dark. As I watch, the ship with the fairy lights floats up into what is surely\
  \ the sky! I follow it intently, till it vanishes from view. A knot in my chest\
  \ seems to open up at last."
