Text: "Welcome to the small and unknown West African coastal nation, Gabon. In fact,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t until I watched a BBC nature show about the country\u2019s beach\
  \ elephants and surfing hippos that I put it on my mental map and realized that\
  \ this must be one of the most extraordinary and Eden-like places on Earth. I wasn\u2019\
  t disappointed.  \n\nGabon is one hell of a ride and an unforgettable adventure\
  \ no matter what you choose to do. It\u2019s difficult to travel as there\u2019\
  s hardly any tourist information, and you\u2019ll meet only a handful of other tourists\
  \ during your trip. On the bright side, you\u2019ll have all the natural wonders\
  \ to yourself. On the downside, you feel quite alone and uninformed at times.\n\n\
  The decision to visit Gabon pushed me to the edge in several senses, and both physically\
  \ and mentally the trip was a challenge. You see firsthand how things deteriorate:\
  \ The decaying of a past European community project set up to secure income for\
  \ a small village; solar panels, water pumps, and, worst of all, the small convenience\
  \ store that never got built, because the community-raised money somehow disappeared.\
  \ Or a research station that had to shut down because the only bridge was washed\
  \ away and no one in the new government bothered to have it rebuilt. \n\nApprox.\
  \ 80% of Gabon remains covered in forest making the country\u2019s national parks\
  \ its main draw. Spending two days getting to our final destination, Loango National\
  \ Park, from the capital of Libreville made us feel that we\u2019d arrived at the\
  \ edge of the world. Not only because this is literally the edge of the land, but\
  \ also in the sense that the coastline encompassing the park is one of the only\
  \ places left in the world where wildlife has direct, unobstructed access to the\
  \ beach. This sad fact also reminds you how this magnificent place symbolizes how\
  \ many of these wild animals are on the edge of extinction. Indeed, my moral compass\
  \ was pushed beyond the edge when we passed strung-up, poached wildlife for sale\
  \ on the roadside.\n\nDespite its hardships, Gabon IS incredible and most certainly\
  \ worthwhile if you\u2019re looking for a wild place to push your boundaries. The\
  \ sheer natural beauty of the country is overwhelming and the encounters with its\
  \ shy wildlife are unforgettable. It\u2019s my philosophy that spreading the word\
  \ to other exploratory travelers is essential to bring in eco-tourism and thus help\
  \ protecting the parks, its inhabitants as well as generating sustainable income\
  \ for the locals."
