Text: "The sun disappeared too fast, turning the ocean grey - a veil drawn suddenly\
  \ over a smiling face. \nWhen I reached this tiny seaside town, I realized how little\
  \ I knew of South Africa beyond its safaris. The town made me restless \u2013 tourists\
  \ had outnumbered residents here since it lost favour as a rest stop for merchant\
  \ ships. All around me, large families seemed to have holidayed here forever, slopping\
  \ beer onto sticky picnic tables, recreating family photos over generations. I had\
  \ to get away - and I chose a hiking trail by the sea, 30 miles from town. \nI traced\
  \ my way past brilliant blue waters, gulls and sunken galleons, watched silently\
  \ by wind-hewn hills. And in my solitude, I forgot all about the trail\u2019s remoteness\
  \ until I found myself alone at an emptying coffee shop with no way back to town.\n\
  An impatient \u2018Hello?\u2019 made me jump \u2013 it was the waitress who had\
  \ just locked up the coffee shop. \u201CIs everything okay?\u201D\n\u201CNot really.\u201D\
  \ I squared my shoulders, prepared to meet with hostility. \u201CI don\u2019t have\
  \ a ride back to town. It's stupid of me, I know.\u201D\n\u201CI get it, it gets\
  \ crowded in town. I guess you couldn\u2019t wait to get away, see what our lovely\
  \ coast had to offer?\u201D She spoke of the coast as hers \u2013 she belonged,\
  \ and that was comforting. \u201CMy dad\u2019s just here \u2013 we can drive you\
  \ back. I\u2019m Emily. I work here when I\u2019m home from university.\u201D \n\
  I was so relieved, I could have hugged her. Pushing aside a mess of ropes and bait\
  \ to make room in the car, I asked about the town.\n\u201CI\u2019ve lived here 40\
  \ years\", her dad said. \"Out at daybreak to fish every day, back by sundown. I\
  \ could make more setting up a restaurant. But my heart is at sea.\u201D His voice\
  \ grew gruff.\nEmily laughed. \u201CDad\u2019s an old-timer. But most people have\
  \ moved away. Those who stay change as little as possible.\u201D While playing host\
  \ to people who feel less familiar each year, I thought.\n\u201CSo do you think\
  \ you\u2019ll come back?\u201D, I asked her.\n\u201CDefinitely. I\u2019m going to\
  \ change things up \u2013 start a centre where people can play music, write, do\
  \ stand-up. That\u2019s what I want to make here \u2013a community, not a place\
  \ to pass through.\u201D\nHer dad smiled. As the cold air brushed my hair, I listened\
  \ to their love for home. In a town that had seemed transitory, there was a solidity\
  \ to their determination to stay, to do the hard work it takes to put down roots.\
  \ \nBack safe and sound, I realized I had been saved by a connection that let me\
  \ glimpse home in an unfamiliar land -- the kind of connection that turns travelling\
  \ into arriving."
