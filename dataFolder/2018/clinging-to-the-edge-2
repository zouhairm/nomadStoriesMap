Text: "The white gravestone leaned back at a drunken angle, peering out over the creeping\
  \ tangle of vegetation, tough as the unforgiving climate. The small, untended graveyard\
  \ was slowly succumbing to nature \u2013 the last evidence of human settlement in\
  \ that place; the houses of the abandoned Newfoundland fishing village long gone,\
  \ physically uprooted and floated further along the coast on barges.\n\nIn the 1960s,\
  \ the government decided they needed to bring the province up to modern Canadian\
  \ standards. The rough land and thinly spread population were thought to make the\
  \ provision of roads, electricity and hospitals uneconomic. So they embarked on\
  \ a resettlement plan, moving small outlying villages to designated \u201CGrowth\
  \ Centres\u201D, mostly ignoring the wishes of the local people.\n\nSome forty years\
  \ later, I was on a sea kayaking trip along Newfoundland's forbidding south coast.\
  \ I discovered that the old French names on the map had become anglicised by the\
  \ locals. My favourite of these linguistic transformations pronounced Baie d'espoir\
  \ as \u201CBay Despair\u201D, neatly flipping the original meaning on its head.\n\
  \nI had been unsure whether or not to sign up for this trip.  Although I had done\
  \ some sea kayaking in my twenties, I was now pushing fifty and was far from my\
  \ peak fitness. Could I still do it? Would I fit in with the group? Would I die?\n\
  \nI was encouraged to discover that the group leader had a decade on me. True, he\
  \ had spent his life working outdoors, not sitting increasingly plumply behind an\
  \ office desk, but even so, he qualified for a bus pass.  Perhaps it really is never\
  \ too late to follow your dreams. I was pleased to discover that my old arms could\
  \ still pull my boat smoothly through the water and I began to relax enough to enjoy\
  \ the cool salt spray, the towering grey-black cliffs and the periscope peeping\
  \ of the seals around us.\n\nThere was a sting in the tale. Rounding Cape la Hune,\
  \ we hit a big swell of three metre rolling waves. In sheer terror, I gripped my\
  \ paddles harder than I thought possible and held on for dear life. It was troubling\
  \ to be seated at the bottom of a ten-foot wall of steely-grey water one moment,\
  \ then seconds later be perched precariously atop a wave, frantically looking around\
  \ for the other paddlers and the direction of travel. Two grim, expletive-filled\
  \ hours later we rounded the cape into calmer waters and breathed a collective sigh\
  \ of relief. Unlike the abandoned village, this trip would not be the end of my\
  \ adventures, but the beginning."
