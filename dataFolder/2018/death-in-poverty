Text: "'Poverty is never by choice, its the situation that renders one poor'. It was\
  \ the time of mid january, cold waves covered the entire northern India. I was on\
  \ a visit to the holy city of Varanasi (Benaras), situated at the banks of perennial\
  \ river The Ganga. The city takes the pride of being one of the oldest in the country\
  \ its history dates back to 11th century.\nThe banks of Ganga is illuminated by\
  \ the piers which are named after different ethnicity and idols. A pier is known\
  \ as Ghat in local language. The journey began from the 'Assi Ghat', surrounded\
  \ by the boats and the boatmen to travel the other side of the Ganga. I preferred\
  \ to walk through the Ghats and meet the local people thereby. Assi Ghat was followed\
  \ by a number of other Ghats to mention, Ganga Mahal, Tusli, Jain, Chetsingh Ghats\
  \ till we finally reached Harishchandra Ghat.\n The Harish Chandra Ghat is one of\
  \ the two creamation Ghats of Varanasi, the other being Manikarnika Ghat. On reaching\
  \ closer to the Ghat I came across sonething which I had never expected to see.\
  \ Something remorseful and horrifying. The cremation rituals of Hindu mythology\
  \ involves burning of dead body under woods. \nI witnessed the last rites of five\
  \ person there. The quantity of woods used, somehow portrayed the financial status\
  \ of the deceased. A body was cremated seperately from the others and I espied that\
  \ the lower half of his body was uncovered from woods. This seemed as if a man was\
  \ burnt alive. The view was disheartening and left me numb for the next few minutes.\
  \ \nAlthough these cremation practices are ritualistic but everyone deserve atleast\
  \ proper last rites. The first line of the story says being poor is accepted to\
  \ none, but the circumstances compel them. 'Death in poverty would be the last thing\
  \ one would wish for'. \nSome events like this one lasts in minds forever. I got\
  \ to learn a lot from this trip of mine. Books, schools and colleges do teach but\
  \ there can be other means of learning as well. For me travelling and public interaction\
  \ are the best learning media."
