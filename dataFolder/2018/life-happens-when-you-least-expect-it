Text: "I have always been someone who procrastinated. With the fixed mindset that\
  \ I occupy, my own doubts have always been my worst enemy in finding my dreams.\
  \ I have never been sure of who I want to be, what I want to accomplish, or where\
  \ I want to end up. All I knew was that I wanted to be successful somehow. At the\
  \ time I was working full time at a local call centre for minimum wage, trying to\
  \ save up money for a few months. After I had $600 saved I decided that I would\
  \ put my entire next cheque in to savings and take a vacation. I ended up choosing\
  \ Africa by the cheesy way of choosing with closing my eyes and spinning a globe.\
  \ Since I\u2019ve always wanted to go to Africa anyway, I wasn\u2019t opposed to\
  \ the decision. With the help of my lover, I started preparing. Bought my passport,\
  \ got the plane tickets, and ordered a room on a resort in Africa. 3 weeks later\
  \ I was there. Nothing else was on my mind for the time leading up. The images,\
  \ the smells, the sounds, the feelings, it was a world I had never experienced.\
  \ I did what every basic tourist does. I went on safaris, spent some time with local\
  \ African tribes to learn about the culture, ate peculiar fruits I had never heard\
  \ of, and got the best tan of my entire life. The time I spent there was liberating.\
  \ The people of Africa live so much more simple than what we do in North America,\
  \ yet they are happier within themselves. From the stories I was told by the children\
  \ of the tribes, I was able to open up as a human being and connect with my inner\
  \ self in a way I wouldn\u2019t have been able to do if I did not go on this trip.\
  \ I stayed for 2 weeks in total. During my stay I also realized just how much Canadian\
  \ dollars are worth in other countries, I could have my own land and house here\
  \ instantly. So that\u2019s when I decided. When I arrived back home I started making\
  \ the plans to move from the eastern coast of Canada to a place that fit my heart\
  \ better. I quit my job, took all of my savings, and went backpacking for the next\
  \ year around multiple different countries. I finally decided to settle down in\
  \ Thailand. It was a better compromise for me and my lover at the time, but Africa\
  \ will always hold a special place in my heart, and that is why I visit every year.\
  \ An opportunity is not your final destination, but a string of choices for you\
  \ to create a path. I have been able to thrive and create a life for myself. Don\u2019\
  t let fear stop you any longer to do the same.\nT\u0101m h\u0304\u1EA1wc\u0131 k\u0304\
