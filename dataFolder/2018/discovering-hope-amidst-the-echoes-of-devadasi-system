Text: "The woman was insistent in her chant. Her voice was hoarse, and it grew hoarser\
  \ with every chant.\n\n\u201CUdho\u2026 Udho,\u201D she repeated as I reluctantly\
  \ opened my eyes.\n\nI tried to make sense of her words. Everyone else in the bus\
  \ seemed impervious to the sudden chanting of an elderly woman. As the bus took\
  \ a sharp turn and started its slow decent down the slope of a hill, land manifested\
  \ in a completely new light. I was at last at my destination \u2013 Saundatti Temple.\
  \ \n\nThe chanting was a devotion offered in service of the Goddess Yellamma. Soon\
  \ another woman joined in, and they started taking turns chanting Udho\u2026 Udho\u2026\
  \n\nThe legend of Goddess Yellamma, also known as Renuka Devi, dates back to centuries.\
  \ From Renuka\u2019s uneventful life of a dutiful wife to the humble acceptance\
  \ of deprivation at her husband\u2019s rebuke, everything is considered symbolic.\
  \ Thousands of devotees visit Saundatti temple every month to pay homage to The\
  \ Goddess of the Fallen. \n\nAs I stood in a long line to enter temple premises,\
  \ I could find no faith within my heart. The society shunned Renuka in life. The\
  \ same society started worshiping her as a Goddess in afterlife. And the same society\
  \ created thousands of Renukas by dedicating girls as Devadasis.\n\nI reached the\
  \ front of the line, but no prayer touched my lips. I left the temple premises.\n\
  \nAlthough Devadasi custom was banned in the year 1982 by Karnataka State Government,\
  \ its echoes are still heard in these parts of the Indian subcontinent. There\u2019\
  s no dearth of single mothers fighting hard to raise their kids. Nor is it uncommon\
  \ for a grown woman to abate her eyes and cry silently when asked about her childhood.\
  \ However, the last thing I expected to discover here was courage \u2013 and the\
  \ will to live.    \n\nAt the village square in Parmanandwadi, former Devadasis\
  \ laugh and pull innocent gags at each other\u2019s expense. One of them catches\
  \ me off guard and says - \u201CPlease don\u2019t get offended. All our husbands\
  \ drink a lot and don\u2019t work either. But there is no point in being sad. So\
  \ we laugh among ourselves.\u201D \n\nA law cannot undo the mark years of exploitation\
  \ leaves on one\u2019s soul; but tides are beginning to turn. Today, former Devadasis\
  \ run their own micro \nbusinesses. The most educated one among them takes responsibility\
  \ and helps everyone else. \n\nBack in Saundatti, The Goddess of the Fallen is still\
  \ worshiped. But the flame of hope burns brighter as more and more former Devadasi\u2019\
  s break the shackles of survival and strive to lead a happy life."
