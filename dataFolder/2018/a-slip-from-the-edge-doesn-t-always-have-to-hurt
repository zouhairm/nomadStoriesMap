Text: "Not very often you find yourself zooming into the plunging layers of you to\
  \ that breath of uncertainty in the moment. You look around. Nothing confuses you\
  \ more than how the aura of amusement had faded its way out. It would a win if one\
  \ could retract those auto-populating thoughts of pending bills, those buddies you\
  \ owe money or many more of discrete monetary factors that govern our existences.\
  \ A door opened and walked out with heated glimpse, my manager who had no superpower\
  \ to skim my thoughts. And the steps just bleached away before I could pack my thoughts\
  \ into their curfew bags. Wait, I know I want to flip into a zone where I painted\
  \ pints of inhale moments of sophistication in simplicity. I demanded the energy\
  \ from within to be impulsive to bid adieu to the machine learning workflows and\
  \ never ending reports. As i exhaled, I resonated with the wild, the cities and\
  \ the roads that invited me into their living room. \u201CHe better approve my sabbatical\u201D\
  . as I watched my manager cracking his knuckles and approve, while the virtual me\
  \ was busy mind mapping the To-Do list for the days to be gone. I walked around\
  \ to my work mates to let them become owners of my routines above the one\u2019\
  s they were busy whining about. They needed help. I could read their their smirks\
  \ triggered the guilt in me. Who\u2019s a good leader to leave behind the group\
  \ about how trapped we became. I recalled \u201CLighthouses don\u2019t go running\
  \ looking for boats to save; they just stand there shining\u201D. I\u2019ve impersonated\
  \ myself as the light house welcoming anyone in my direction or was drifting into\
  \ nowhere.I enforced the urge that cannot be bypassed because of presentations and\
  \ late night calls that kept us away from listening to ourselves. In our quest for\
  \ tranquility and peace, we seek refuge in the rejuvenating arms of this universe.\
  \ And may be these team lunches or beach parties are not the coupon codes. We all\
  \ crave it. Some give in. Some don\u2019t. The outlook reminders dialog box popped\
  \ open \u201CProject Update Meeting In 15 minutes\u201D when the room was occupied\
  \ by souls trying to listen to the explorer in them. \u201CYou think it\u2019s not\
  \ too late still\u201D, Dinesh exclaimed. I don\u2019t think was more proud of anything\
  \ else I owned up to. Even if the change you intend to the size of Big Bang, they\
  \ all begin with one step at a time. One day all your teeth will be gone, Your spine\
  \ will be bent, Hair line  receded & you will be left to sit in a corner chair,\
  \ it\u2019s never late till we get there, I ended."
