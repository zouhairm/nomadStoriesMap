Text: "Stepping out into the evening, the first thing you notice in Shinjuku are the\
  \ colours; long after the sun has set is when the city of Tokyo truly comes to life.\
  \ Bright neon signs light up the hordes of people walking through the streets, and\
  \ the exotic smells of Japanese food assault your senses as you wander aimlessly,\
  \ mesmerised by the crazy world around you. Full of buzzing energy, the Shinjuku\
  \ district is famous for its delectable ramen houses, plentiful karaoke bars, and\
  \ bright, bright lights. Just west of the train station, however, lies a secret\
  \ that Tokyo locals prefer to keep to themselves.\n\nWe\u2019d heard nothing but\
  \ great things about the infamous \u2018Piss Alley\u2019. Despite its delightful\
  \ name, Piss Alley is one of the most underrated places in Tokyo. Relatively unknown\
  \ to tourists, the cramped alley is full of tiny bars and restaurants, some so small\
  \ they only fit several people at a time. A local hotspot in the city, many of the\
  \ places in Piss Alley won\u2019t even allow gaijins in, so you can\u2019t take\
  \ it personally if you try to get a seat in a seemingly empty bar and you\u2019\
  re told that its full. We didn\u2019t have high hopes for getting a spot in one\
  \ of the tiny shops, but we knew we\u2019d kick ourselves if we didn\u2019t at least\
  \ try.\n\nPiss Alley got its name quite literally, as the area used to be a dive\
  \ for dodgy locals to get drunk. Given the small space and lack of toilets, people\
  \ used to answer nature\u2019s call wherever they pleased \u2013 hence the name.\
  \ Charming, right? But charming is exactly what Piss Alley is, and if you can manage\
  \ to get a table in one of the teeny bars or restaurants, you\u2019ll see why.\n\
  \nOur group, despite being seven people strong, managed to get the only table in\
  \ one of the restaurants. It wasn\u2019t comfortable, but we all squeezed in and\
  \ began to peruse the strange menu. Being a vegetarian there was little that appealed\
  \ to my taste buds; although even if I wasn\u2019t, I doubt I would have had the\
  \ stomach to try the raw horse meat, so instead I settled for the mushroom skewers\
  \ and a shot of warm sake.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to describe the atmosphere in Piss\
  \ Alley. It\u2019s so cramped and busy but is absolutely bursting at the seams with\
  \ culture, life, and joy. Being granted access to one of the little restaurants\
  \ was the last thing I expected, considering that many Westerners are turned away\
  \ on sight. Even so, it is worth trying your luck; if you aren\u2019t successful,\
  \ simply wandering down the long, narrow paths that make up Piss Alley is an experience\
  \ you won\u2019t soon forget."
