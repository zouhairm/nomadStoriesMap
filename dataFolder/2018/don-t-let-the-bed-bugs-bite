Text: "By the second morning when I woke up once again covered in bites I was convinced\
  \ that I had contracted bed bugs from when I was in the mountains. I was stroke\
  \ with guilt for having brought these critters to my new residence. Instead of keeping\
  \ this new knowledge to myself I thought it only right to tell my new roommates\
  \ and face the ostracism I was sure would come next. Alma and Roda had been so nice\
  \ to me prior and had offered to take me to the market to try some local cuisine,\
  \ I was sure they'd cancel now. I was taken back to that time in kindergarten where\
  \ I peed my pants and became the class pariah, well at least for a few days. Well\
  \ to my surprise they just laughed at me. For some reason they had me pegged as\
  \ dramatics and thought I\u2019d simply just been bit by mosquitoes. Even though\
  \ they didn\u2019t believe me they helped me. They never offered to help me, nor\
  \ did they wait for me to ask for help, they simply jumped to action. I told them\
  \ that it wasn\u2019t necessary and that I could handle it myself; but I might as\
  \ well have been talking into the wind. Barely after the words escaped my lips Roda\
  \ was stripping my bed of its sheets and blankets; and Alma was shooing me along\
  \ to the store to get laundry detergent. By the time we got back from the store\
  \ Roda was in the process of sweeping the floor. Alma had talked to the owner of\
  \ the hostel and got her to start a fire and get us a big pot; so, we could boil\
  \ some water my clothes. I begin to take my clothes out of my backpack and prepare\
  \ to wash them. But I was quickly demoted from this position as well. Alma said\
  \ that since I was from America that I probably never hand washed my clothes. She\
  \ showed me the proper technique and I was allowed to help in the process. While\
  \ waiting for more water to boil I went to see if there was anything further for\
  \ me to do in the room. There wasn\u2019t, Roda had already put new sheets on my\
  \ bed and was finishing up mopping the entire floor. I was touched to my core, these\
  \ were not people who worked at the hostel doing their job, these were fellow guest\
  \ using their free time to help a stranger. The process of washing, boiling, wringing,\
  \ and hanging up my clothes took about two and a half hours. At numerous points\
  \ I told them I would take it from here, but not helping simply wasn\u2019t option\
  \ for them. What was so profound to me was not just that they were willing to help\
  \ me, a stranger; but that they didn\u2019t see a need and yet went above and beyond\
  \ to help me anyway."
