Text: "People said she was crazy and that it was dangerous. Of course they have to\
  \ say this to express that they care. Sometimes, however, it only serves as an expectation\
  \ of how one has to react when the only notion you receive of a place is that of\
  \ the news channels. Yes, the media today is very powerful. And the human mind is\
  \ even more powerful to only see the bad and not the beauty. \n\nNo matter how often\
  \ people will say 'she is crazy' - all she is, is being intrigued by the world and\
  \ the humanity that can be found anywhere. She is a realist and when she arrived\
  \ a second time in Bethlehem she knew that there is tension. She knew that things\
  \ can happen and that soldiers will ask for her passport whilst checking a sherut.\
  \ That she will have to leave the bus like everyone else when crossing the checkpoint\
  \ and into Israel. Soldiers who have barely seen anything have all the reasons in\
  \ the world to mistrust. And they make you get off the bus to check for explosives.\
  \ Women, men, the old and the young - all have to climb out that bus for inspection.\
  \ In the West they talk about discrimination and insult, here - you deal with it.\
  \ And the beauty is that both sides hope that this mistrust will end. One day. Both\
  \ sides are awaiting apologies and yet they have not happened.\n\nYou reach Jerusalem\
  \ and feel privileged. You head into the Old City where you bargain on spices, shoes,\
  \ plastic containers and cosmetics. You walk the Via Dolorosa and imagine the pain\
  \ of carrying that cross. You walk and reach the Al-Aqsa Mosque. You take a glimpse\
  \ and you feel privileged because there will be thousands declined entering Israel\
  \ again during Ramadan. You take a step back and wonder if trust will ever be regained.\
  \ And then on your next visit to Jerusalem, you pass those who are not allowed to\
  \ cross the checkpoint. You pass those who don't have permission to see the Old\
  \ City as they lack paperwork or because of a last minute decision of the neighbor\
  \ next to you. You start pondering about trust. You start wondering why a few people\
  \ will always succeed in portraying the bad. \n\nIt was easy to talk to people.\
  \ They trusted me - even a Jewish juice vendor who spoke about his compulsory military\
  \ service. He said he saw things he never believed would happen. Adrenaline on both\
  \ sides... and a lack of trust. This is what they show us on TV. There is trust\
  \ - because I saw the patience of those denied entrance: Peaceful, trusting faces\
  \ as I am walking through the busy streets of the Old City."
