Text: "I was a journalist in the biggest fashion magazine in Indonesia\u2019s capital\
  \ of Jakarta with a very good position: feature editor. With all the glitz and glams,\
  \ I thought my life was already perfect. Until that day\u2026\n\nI remember it very\
  \ well like it\u2019s yesterday. On August 4th, 2014 I found out that I\u2019ve\
  \ been HIV positive. My whole life was suddenly destroyed right before my eyes like\
  \ a house of cards. My CD4 level was so low even the doctor said that I was almost\
  \ helpless. Yet I still survived, but with a new friend: Depression. I hide it from\
  \ everyone but closest friends. Eversince, I tried to kill myself once, had insomnia,\
  \ and still managed to go to work the next day as if nothing happened.\n\nIn July\
  \ 2015, right before my birthday, I couldn\u2019t stand the big city anymore and\
  \ decided to leave that picture perfect career to move to a tropical paradise called\
  \ BALI (2hrs flight from Jakarta). \n\nIn Bali, I lived near the beach. So whenever\
  \ I felt the anxiety and depression attacked, I just walked there and saw how beautiful\
  \ the ocean and sunset was. How beautiful life is. From that day, I\u2019ve decided\
  \ to travel more beautiful places as much as I can while I\u2019m still alive and\
  \ to do something I\u2019ve never did before. In the last two years, I\u2019ve already\
  \ trekked into a secluded hidden ancient village of Baduy in West Java (Indonesia)\
  \ and lived among them, climbed the rocky hills in Pianemo (Papua, Indonesia), dived\
  \ in two of the world best diving spots, Wakatobi (Sulawesi) and Raja Ampat (Papua)\
  \ without previous certified training, swimming with sharks in the open ocean, and\
  \ other things that I\u2019ve never imagined before.\n\nTraveling makes me value\
  \ life even more. I used to feel like I\u2019m the saddest, most miserable people\
  \ in the world because of the HIV. But living with those villagers in Baduy Village\
  \ who lives without electricity and yet still seems very happy and grateful had\
  \ made me feel ashamed of myself. \n\nYes, the HIV is a bad disease and it changes\
  \ people. But I\u2019ve never feel happier and healthier than today. I wouldn\u2019\
  t have been a traveler if not because of that virus - only a miserable guy living\
  \ a meaningless life: working 9 to 6, and partying all night long everyday. I\u2019\
  ve taken care of myself very well (the virus\u2019s been undetectable for over a\
  \ year now) so I can travel more often and visit new places I\u2019ve only seen\
  \ in magazines. \n\nTherefore, I want to inspire other people to travel more. Because\
  \ we only life once and the world is such a beautiful place."
