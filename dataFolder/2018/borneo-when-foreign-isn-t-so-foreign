Text: "When I arrived in Borneo, my expectations were immediately shattered. A place\
  \ where head hunting occurred 60 years ago had my imagination running wild with\
  \ mystery and intrigue: I pictured dense jungles and exotic animals, tribal cultures\
  \ and mystical traditions. \n\nYet when I landed in Kuching, it became apparent\
  \ that Borneo wasn\u2019t what I had imagined. I strolled through a developed metropolis\
  \ with ornamental buildings, a sprawling waterfront and boutique shops. To compound\
  \ matters, my host took me directly from the airport to a newly renovated gym.\n\
  \nThis didn\u2019t align with my expectations, as I came to Borneo hoping to live\
  \ with the Iban people, and imbibe the wisdom of nature-based indigenous cultures.\
  \ And yet, on my second night in Borneo, I found myself at a fancy wedding, shaking\
  \ the hands of esteemed politicians and over hearing the guests talk about the calories\
  \ they would have to burn, as the cake was just too darn good.  \n\nI dove deeper\
  \ into Borneo and different pictures of the Malaysian States surfaced: exceptional\
  \ national parks, precipitous mountains, sprawling coastlines, hospitable Muslims,\
  \ and a highly venerated jungle culture. Gradually, as my mental picture was being\
  \ re-painted, Borneo was taking its place deeper in my heart.\n\nToward the end\
  \ of my stay, I finally lived with Iban people in a long house, which shelters 150\
  \ people. My host was the headmaster, who will proudly talk of the two enemies he\
  \ headhunted in the 50\u2019s. Yet, I was greeted with tile floors, and wooden crosses,\
  \ blinking TV\u2019s and children on cell phones.\n\nI once again had to let go\
  \ of my mental preconceptions. Though, when I released what I thought I was looking\
  \ for, it found me instead. I learned to fish with a spear gun, look for the sacred\
  \ hornbill, and distinguish dead trees from live ones.\n\nBorneo and its diversity\
  \ made a lasting impression on me. Muslims invited me \u2013 a blonde-haired Jewish\
  \ kid - into their homes. I practiced yoga with them, was invited into mosques,\
  \ and attended weddings, allowing for us to see each other as humans instead of\
  \ religious labels. No matter the landscape, from dense jungles, to SE Asia\u2019\
  s largest peak, to white sand beaches, I found home in a feeling. And it was the\
  \ unprecedented level of similitude it allowed me to feel. From the gym-goers in\
  \ Kuching, to the Iban in the jungle, I realized, no matter how different the shades\
  \ of humanity may seem, not only are they unimportant, they are wholly trivial in\
  \ light of the sentience we all share."
