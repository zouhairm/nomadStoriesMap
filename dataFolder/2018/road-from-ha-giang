Text: "It was the first time I had felt unsafe in southeast Asia. I had landed in\
  \ Hanoi just a few days earlier\u2014by myself, shivering in the north Vietnamese\
  \ winter\u2014and was now looking up at the weathered face of a man trying to hoist\
  \ me up from a ditch on the side of the road.\n\nI had just finished a three-month\
  \ stint in Singapore. My internship had been cut short, visa issues\u2014what if\
  \ I snuck in a little backpacking trip to Vietnam before flying home to Canada?\
  \  \n\nThe illicit energy of the trip propelled me as much as the promise of the\
  \ mountains. My first night in Hanoi a drunk Englishman slid his phone across the\
  \ bar at me, \u201CYou ever heard of the Ha Giang loop? I biked through all of Vietnam,\
  \ and this, this made it all worth it.\u201D\n\nDone. I booked a bus to Sapa, picked\
  \ up an Austrian law student on the way, and took my first scooter lesson outside\
  \ a hostel on the Chinese border. \n\nThe first day, spent waiting for a bus transfer,\
  \ was sweet and dreamy. A soft milky haze had settled over the mountain town and\
  \ my new companion and I shared stories over a hotpot. The second day we started\
  \ biking, stopping to climb a known mountain pass. The third day, as our path took\
  \ us deeper into the mountains, the once-atmospheric fog suddenly became dense,\
  \ completely blanketing our view and caking the road in a slick of water. Riding\
  \ behind me, my Austrian companion broke too late at a stop, slipped, and crashed\
  \ into me.\n\nI was done. Not physically\u2014I was dusted off and assured I was\
  \ more or less sound\u2014but after we wobbled back to town, me angrily slurping\
  \ my pho at an inn as my scooter got serviced, I turned around to my Austrian counterpart\
  \ and announced I was leaving.\n\nThis could easily be a story about redemption.\
  \ In one version, the universe bestowing due deliverance for daring to travel alone,\
  \ in another, I receive salvation from the Vietnamese mountains. No, what I want\
  \ to talk about is choice. About taking pride and ownership of choice. I chose the\
  \ Ha Giang loop, I chose my Austrian partner, and then when I felt I had gotten\
  \ all I could, I chose to leave. \n\nThere\u2019s a valley in this story. Two motorcycles\
  \ leaned up against a rock and a group of kids stretching their arms across the\
  \ sunlit sky. Cut to another scene and I\u2019m zipping on the back of a motorcycle,\
  \ squeezing the life out of a poor Vietnamese boy. There\u2019s us riding into town\
  \ at 7 at night, way past sunset, stopping outside the bus station. I get an address\
  \ on a piece of paper. Another choice."
