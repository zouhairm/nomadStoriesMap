Text: "I didn't expect that afternoon prior my final year proyect someone was offer\
  \ me the oportunity to go with him and his family from Spain to England to be their\
  \ Au Pair. I've always wanted to live this experience but I could never find the\
  \ moment because of the degree, so I was there petrified with the phone stucked\
  \ in the ear reviewing my speech and dying of screaming yes. Then, it was at that\
  \ moment that I let go of all the nerves and accepted without giving it more laps,\
  \ having to leave in two days because they needed me urgently. \nAnd there I was,\
  \ recently graduated in Nursing at the Almeria's airport with the person who had\
  \ offered me the little big job waiting for their children to come with the grandpa\
  \ to take the plain and start a new adventure all together. \nFor the three little\
  \ ones it was the first time they traveled to England. At the beggining when we\
  \ met, they were very shy with me but in a few minuts of play they were more confidence\
  \ and we started making jokes and laugh; they are absolut lovely.\nI spent a month\
  \ with them and in that month, that happened very quickly, I became like their older\
  \ sister, but I also lived a lot of new emotions discovering places together, new\
  \ fields to play, giving them a little scare with the T-rex of the London Science\
  \ Museum and basically taking care of the most beautiful children in the world.\
  \ \nBut my foster parents wanted me to also have a break and they introduced me\
  \ to their co-workers who had ages similar to mine. And in a karaoke night, drinking\
  \ some pints and having fun one of the French guys and I endend up liking each other.\
  \ I got everything by surprise but in that season I was very happy, the problem\
  \ was that the company was moving him to New Zealand to start working there and\
  \ we were going to be very far away and we wanted to keep get in touch, but he left\
  \ because he had to. As we both stayed with the desire to see each other again,\
  \ he planned an escape to Europe again, specifically to his city, Bordeaux, and\
  \ invited me to visit him. I did not hesitate to save the Au Pairing money to pay\
  \ the plain tickets, so one month later I was travelling from London to Bordeaux\
  \ for love. I enjoyed a lot those places and the experiences I lived, but no matter\
  \ how beautiful the places were, I felt that good because of the people who lived\
  \ in there and I think that is the essence of traveling, feeling one more through\
  \ their people, and who knows maybe the next stop is New Zealand..."
