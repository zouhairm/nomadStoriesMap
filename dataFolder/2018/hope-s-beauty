Text: "Rubbing the sleep from my eyes and finger-brushing stray hairs away from my\
  \ face, I took a deep breath in to the now too familiar smell of manure and the\
  \ brisk morning breeze doing it's routine dance that took advantage of my loose\
  \ fitting pyjamas and tickled the hairs on my arm. I looked at my surroundings,\
  \ the sky still had its usual bleak, greyness and ahead the silhouette of meandering\
  \ lines framing the infinite mountains in the distance,  almost as if an artist\
  \ in his most beautiful melancholic, depression had painted. A painting that made\
  \ you feel it's desolation.\n\nPablo was seated where he had been for the past 3\
  \ mornings. Face wrinkled with fierce engagement staring into his own canvas; where\
  \ he'd been painting his own vision for this parched land. La Florida, Peru.\n\n\
  He was well travelled, spoke 4 different languages and yet - I'd wondered everyday\
  \ - why he decided to come back and stay in this barren land of solitude and simplicity.\
  \ Having only shades of brown and grey to greet him each morning. He had told stories\
  \ of his accounts around the world; enthralling, deep, menacing tales that left\
  \ me wide eyed and always wanting to know more each time he told them. His voice\
  \ quickened and his breath stalled when he spoke, his fervour radiating.\n\n'So\
  \ why did you come back to La Florida?' I asked, hoping for some philosophical insight\
  \ into his return; what he replied with was something unexpected, 'Hope made me\
  \ return' he chuckled. The inquisition began. It made so much sense, of course,\
  \ for someone to return for love. I'd continue to coax Pablo into introducing me\
  \ to Hope. I wanted to meet her, to see for myself the beauty that enticed Pablo\
  \ back. \n\nThat morning I awoke with a yearning for answers. I needed to see for\
  \ myself why, in this place -with land so infertile that nothing aspired to grow\
  \ out of it - would there be such a great 'vision' to be had?\n\nI opened the bedroom\
  \ door, the usual clouds hovering above. I looked over to Pablo but he wasn't there.\
  \ That's when I saw her. Hope. Etched into the canvas Pablo fondled over everyday.\
  \ Next to the paintings of shrubbery, trees and a small flowing river from the mountain\
  \ top. I stared at it in awe 'Monte de esperansa' (Mountain of hope). It was my\
  \ morning view with vivid colour and soul. A painting I felt - I felt Pablo's hope\
  \ I had been searching so hard to find. And right there - next to Hope - a small\
  \ green plant, dancing with the brisk morning breeze."
