Text: "She doubled over, dirt crusted hands on her knees, forcing the cool fresh mountain\
  \ air into her lungs and dashed the stained, rough, homespun fabric of her sleeve\
  \ across her snot covered face. She risked a glance behind her and let out a high-pitched\
  \ squeal. The sound echoed around her, bouncing off the high mountain peaks of her\
  \ isolation.\nThey were getting closer.\nAs the loud BOOM of a frozen mountain face\
  \ broke off and slid into the glacial waters below, the entire valley echoed with\
  \ dismay. She gritted her teeth and continued forward. As she ran on, a chasm appeared\
  \ before her, freezing glacial waters below, her two pursuers still gaining. She\
  \ looked around, there was nowhere else to go. The pristine ice blue waters glistened,\
  \ the snow peaked caps watched in the distance, there was a sense of stillness in\
  \ the valley, the closest source of help lay in the homemade wood and mud cabin\
  \ that sat atop a tiny hill in the distance.\nShe weighed her chances; a determined\
  \ look settled across her young face. She picked up her brightly coloured woven\
  \ skirts, took a deep breath and leapt. \nShe screamed, her left foot slipped as\
  \ she threw herself across the chasm, arms flaying out to grab onto tufts of grass\
  \ that were her life support. She pulled herself up, a grin of satisfaction spreading\
  \ across her face. \n\u201COoommpphhh\u201D the body of a young boy hurtled into\
  \ her.\n\u201CTag, you\u2019re it\u201D he yelled at her as he bounded off across\
  \ the little grass tuft islands on the shores of the lake. She let out another squeal,\
  \ this time filled with laughter as she leapt off after him.\nDeep along the Huayhuash\
  \ circuit, high in the Peruvian Andes, 3 young children play in the shallows of\
  \ a glacial lake, jumping from island to island, tears of laughter painting their\
  \ grubby cheeks, the squeals of their pleasure echoing in the valley. A smile spreads\
  \ across my face, the laughter is contagious, the pure delight in these innocent\
  \ children is mesmerising. \nI think back to my childhood, where is the television?\
  \ Where is the playstation? Where is the ipad? I put my camera down, grin plastered\
  \ over my face, and run to the shores of this isolated lake to relearn what it is\
  \ like to be young and carefree again."
