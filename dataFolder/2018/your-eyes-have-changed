Text: "I was living in Ghana, in a village in the southeast, before my eyes changed.\L\
  \nIn the morning I taught in an high school and in the afternoon I studied or spend\
  \ my time with the students. Sundays was always mass time: time to sing, dance and\
  \ pray. \nAfter two months I wanted to explore, going out my environment. What more\
  \ beyond my little village? I take the Trotro, their bus, towards the Ghana waterfalls,\
  \ named Wli Falls. There I met Safo, a little big rasta. Little because he\u2019\
  s seriously short but have a very big head.\nThe place in the wood that he built\
  \ with the help of the community around, made entirely of bamboo, the bar, the rooms,\
  \ tables and chairs, was extraordinary in its simplicity.\nThe Ghanian that I know\
  \ in my village always said they wanted to know Europe, the rich country, live like\
  \ them but Safo, that lived in a bamboo forest close to the waterfall, born under\
  \ a mango tree, had a different thought.\n\"Some Ghanaians have European wishes\
  \ and seem to have forgotten about our culture, our tradition and this makes me\
  \ sad because what is more beautiful than the differences that distinguish us? The\
  \ ingredients in the world are always the same, tomatoes are tomatoes but every\
  \ culture combines them in their own way, and that's the beauty, tasting different\
  \ types of cuisine. So I build this place in the woods, to live a simple lifestyle,\
  \ nature has everything we need and we must remember it \".\nI confess that, perhaps\
  \ because I grew up in a big town in Italy, I forgot natural living and I continue\
  \ to look for it every day. I was there for that reason. \LWhen I went to see the\
  \ waterfalls there were many Ghanaians intent on taking pictures. In general, Ghanian\
  \ do not take bath, except to wash themselves, but those were Ghanaians on a trip,\
  \ so far away from the water. \nI was worried about their looks when I decided to\
  \ go under the waterfall. I was also worried about the icy water but Safo, without\
  \ any word from me, told me \u201Cwhy you are still here and don\u2019t do what\
  \ you want to do?\u201D and then nothing stopped me.\nThe water was really cold\
  \ but even though my heart was pounding, I came under the waterfall and I looked\
  \ up. That\u2019s was the real show, so simple and so magical.\nWhen I decide to\
  \ greet the waterfall and go back, I find out that the local who were there had\
  \ decided to take a bath, all dressed up.\n\"Crazy girl\" was my name that afternoon,\
  \ that I spent playing with Ghanians in the water.\nOnce back in the woods the rasta\
  \ looks at me and tells me \"Your eyes have changed\u201D."
