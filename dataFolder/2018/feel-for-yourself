Text: "Most of the time you have an idea of a place, its people and culture, through\
  \ information brought by media, movies, books and songs.\nYou build your stereotypes\
  \ according to it and your own past experiences. We all do.\n\nAt 5am on a chilly\
  \ Tuesday I left Lisbon behind. No, I wasn\xB4t flying over the ocean right away.\
  \ Only after 4 hours  in Schiphol airport at Amsterdam I finally get in my \u201C\
  to the west\u201D flight and landed JFK airport at a warm and shinning afternoon.\n\
  \nOutside, seeing multi-ethnic passengers in their hurry with a clear and welcoming\
  \ blue sky above, I really felt getting in another world. I can\u2019t explain it.\
  \ There was something about the air. Or maybe it\u2019s just my colourful imagination.\
  \ The afternoon was coming to an end and the sun was low. I will always keep in\
  \ my mind that light orange sunset with Manhattan in front of me. \nThe following\
  \ days ran fast and vibrant, like a waterfall.\n\nAnd a crazy idea pops up in my\
  \ head. What if i go to a Yankees game? Said and done. Oh, being in the ticket queue,\
  \ asking a fellow how long would it last?! Only a foreigner could ask that, I guess.\
  \ After all, there isn\u2019t such thing as fixed game duration in baseball.\nWith\
  \ my cheapest 4th floor ticket i got in and started enjoying the atmosphere. For\
  \ a football fan like me, it was like visiting a temple of another religion. You\
  \ are amazed but quiet. So exited even you don\u2019t really understand what\u2019\
  s going on in the field.\nSuddenly 2 guys, twice of my size, start commenting something\
  \ about the match directly to me. Of course I had to explain my situation of total\
  \ ignorance. From there to having one of them telling me how crazy his son was for\
  \ Cristiano Ronaldo was a really small step. Between laughs and trying to figure\
  \ out what they were really saying I found myself being offered a 1st class ticket.\n\
  \u201CDo you see that sign down there? This seat is over there. We will not use\
  \ it, enjoy the match\u201D. Well, what can I say? Was I expecting that? No. Did\
  \ I take those? Hell yes! After a group picture with these generous gentlemen I\
  \ went to see the rest of the match in the ground floor, pretty close to the players.\
  \ This kind of warm welcoming gesture felt awesome!\n\nSo, you see, movies and books\
  \ are great. Newspapers, TV and online content can give you an idea. But you will\
  \ never understand a city, a place, their people and culture until you fell your\
  \ arms and your chest shaking by the excitement you fell in a stranger\u2019s laughs\
  \ when you both realize you have a world in common."
