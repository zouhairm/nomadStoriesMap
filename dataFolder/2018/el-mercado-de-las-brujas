Text: "My fingers ran over the bright, colourful fabrics that were placed near the\
  \ entrance to the small shop, but just past the shop\u2019s vibrant exterior, the\
  \ inside was dark. That didn\u2019t matter - I was searching for something else,\
  \ something much more exciting than the traditionally dyed fabrics sold on this\
  \ narrow street in Bolivia\u2019s capital city.\nI turned a corner onto a smaller,\
  \ much more crowded street, and stepped into El Mercado de las Brujas, the Witch\u2019\
  s Market. The contents of each shop spilled out onto the street, and my eyes took\
  \ in all the strange and interesting wares being sold here. The shop owners, most\
  \ of them small, old women, were dressed in the traditional Bolivian fashion of\
  \ pleated skirts, embroidered shirts, and shawls draped over their shoulders. A\
  \ brimmed hat covered hair that was plaited into two braids running down their backs.\n\
  I had read a bit about the Witch\u2019s Market before arriving in La Paz. In addition\
  \ to the typical stone statue charms for health, energy, and luck, you could also\
  \ purchase potions for love, curse an ex, or find a sorcerer to cast a spell for\
  \ you, if you paid the right price.\nI walked up to one of the small shops cautiously,\
  \ gazing at all the strange things lining the shelves inside. The shop owner watched\
  \ me silently, sitting on her stool. My eyes swept the shop and rested on the twisted\
  \ forms hanging from the entry-way. I walked closer and the shop owner, noticing\
  \ my gaze, stood up.\n\u201CAh, yes,\u201D she said to me in Spanish, \u201Cthese\
  \ are llama fetuses, do you know about them?\u201D When I told her no, she eagerly\
  \ explained that llama fetuses are given as an offering to Pachamama, the goddess\
  \ Mother Earth. They burn and bury them underneath houses for protection and forgiveness\
  \ for disturbing the land. She pointed to a simple spiral symbol, a symbol that\
  \ I could now see everywhere in the shop \u2013 the symbol for Pachamama.\nGlancing\
  \ outside, at the darkening clouds, the woman frowned. \u201CIt looks like rain,\
  \ I must prepare to close. Here, for you.\u201D She took a small stone figurine\
  \ of a condor and pressed it into my hand. \u201CFor safe travels.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Thank-you,\u201D I said, running my fingers over the tiny details carved into the\
  \ stone. I turned back to look at the woman as I walked away. She was quickly and\
  \ expertly moving all of her wares inside, and when she saw me watching her, she\
  \ gave me a toothy grin before she pulled the gates shut to lock up. I pocketed\
  \ my condor charm, and, sure enough, I felt just a few rain drops before the sky\
  \ opened."
