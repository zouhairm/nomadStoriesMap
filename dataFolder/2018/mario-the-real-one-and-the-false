Text: "Wanderer, there is no path, the path is made by walking. This idea by Antonio\
  \ Machado was circulating on my mind on my unforgettable path, on the Camino. I\
  \ left behind a luxury life after escaping from a communist country and chose the\
  \ Way into the nowhere or wild or the equal opportunities.\nI went there alone,\
  \ because I needed to be on my own, and finally spent only some days from the 40\
  \ with my individuality. I was surrounded by people, nations, cultures, gestures\
  \ and pure nature. Everything seemed to me as an utopy. And in this floating atmosphere\
  \ I met Mario. The real one. The Magician from Canada. \nIn Sansol we searched for\
  \ the same albergue with swimming pool, a real miracle in the Spanish steppe. Although\
  \ we did not find it, but we found a tiny little bar with giant cold beer and each\
  \ other. We continued our way together. Age, nationality, speed, gender did not\
  \ count. Just the same goal: be there and go one step further. And another one.\
  \ After walking together one week, in Burgos we decided, although between tears,\
  \ to separate and not to be separated from the world being always together. We were\
  \ in harmony also with our decision. \nI followed my way towards Santiago on my\
  \ own. Mario did the same. Three long days ALONE. With big letters. I fastened my\
  \ steps and asked for Mario everywhere but without any echo. He drawn signes for\
  \ me on the way but without any answer. We lost each other and had to accept in\
  \ the reality our decision.\nIn San Nicol\xE1s I met another Mario, the false one.\
  \ The tentation from Italy. I was happy to forget my sadness and to be in company\
  \ again. But maybe for my physical, spiritual or mental tiredness I got an infection\
  \ caused by a flea and needed to see a doctor and change my clothes. Mario wanted\
  \ to continue his way so left me alone with my pain and my tears. I was really sorry\
  \ for myself but I knew I could not give it up. Went to the doctor, went to a shop,\
  \ bought new trousers, T-shirts, socks and sat down for a cigarette on a small square\
  \ in Carri\xF3n de los Condes. Suddenly I saw something familiar. A red country\
  \ hat. A man. Mario, the real one. The Magician from Canada. \nSantiago welcomed\
  \ us with open heart. We arrived together and met there the whole world known on\
  \ the way. Then the Camino continued: to Montreal and to Budapest. \nIt happened\
  \ 8 years ago. Today I have got news from Mario from Galapagos, from the Camino\
  \ de las tortugas: Life is beautiful."
