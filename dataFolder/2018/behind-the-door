Text: "They call it Santa la Linda for a reason. After the cold rainy days I have\
  \ had in Buenos Aires, I just needed a city where you can walk in your sandals,\
  \ a plaza with luxuriant palms, the noisy cheerfulness of the celebrations for the\
  \ Virgen del Milagro festivity that is about to end.\nSalta immediately feels like\
  \ a place to enjoy getting lost in. Have you ever noticed how different a city looks\
  \ if you simply raise your sight? I love doing that, even in my hometown. I just\
  \ follow my gaze in search of beauty, for once not concerned about the time or on\
  \ getting someplace in particular. Calle Bartolom\xE9 Mitre, empty in the afternoon\
  \ sun, recalls the city\u2019s colonial past. I walk along grand palaces in pastel\
  \ colors, with decorative friezes carved in stone and balconies that speak of long\
  \ evenings of chatting and people watching.\nI am enchanted by the solid portals\
  \ behind which I imagine shadowy gardens, in the same fashion you can find in Spain,\
  \ or Southern Italy. I notice a door that is half open and give a peek inside. In\
  \ the lobby there is a nice play of light,  between a mirror leaning against the\
  \ wall and across the checkered floor.\nI would like to catch it on a picture to\
  \ bring this moment home, but I\u2019m a slow photographer. I need my time to check\
  \ all the settings and find the right angle. I see an elegant elderly man, a couple\
  \ of steps away. I guess he\u2019s waiting for me to snap and I signal for him to\
  \ pass as I don\u2019t want him to stand there watching me, making me feel even\
  \ more aware of my inability. \nHe smiles at me and explains he\u2019s actually\
  \ supposed to get in. Would I like to join him for a cup of coffee? I end up in\
  \ the front room of the Pe\xF1a Espa\xF1ola, with Jorge telling me about the story\
  \ of this private club, a gentlemen\u2019s alternative to the traditional siesta.\
  \ Businessmen who are not into the tradition of spending a couple of hours home\
  \ before starting with their afternoon activities meet here to play cards, relax,\
  \ exchange the latest news - or gossip.\nWhen Jorge hears where I\u2019m from, he\u2019\
  s delighted. It looks like all Argentinian I meet have some kind of connection to\
  \ Italy and he\u2019s no exception. It\u2019s a good feeling to have all the time\
  \ in the world to just listen to someone\u2019s story: his grandparents coming from\
  \ Sicily, his childhood in Salta, his family and friends and dreams. He is in no\
  \ hurry and neither am I. It\u2019s no more than that, the essence of connection.\
  \ To pull out of the everyday rush, just for a handful of minutes."
