Text: "There's a place in the Moroccan desert where a visionary man is creating something\
  \ of completely new. Every day he works on his dream: making the desert a source\
  \ of life, trough his farm under the Palm Trees where he grows some vegetables and\
  \ fruits, despite the few resources and the difficult environmental conditions.\n\
  I got to the Sahara Desert cycling through the Valle du Draa: after the beautiful\
  \ Atlas Mountains I rode my bicycle to M\u2019hamid El Ghizlane, the last village\
  \ before the immensities of the Sahara. Monsieur Madani was waiting for me.\nIn\
  \ my 1 month-long solo-trip by bicycle in Morocco, I was looking for a farm to rest\
  \ living few days of WWOOFING, an experience that I had already lived during my\
  \ backpacking trip to California, 5 years ago. I discovered the farm and I was immediately\
  \ fascinated.\nHe walks softly and barefoot, Madani. He can\u2019t read or write\
  \ but he speaks fluently French, English and a bit of Japanese, because of people\
  \ he meets. He\u2019s an open-minded, glowing person who has a life-vision that\
  \ embraces all differences in culture. \nMadani was born and raised nomad in the\
  \ desert with his 20 brothers and a mother 40years younger of his father: \u201C\
  They were really in love\u201D he told me smiling \u201CLove has no limits.\u201D\
  \ He was 17years old when he had to settle because of the drought and the lack of\
  \ water.\nIn 2006 he walked for six months in the desert and he had a hunch: he\
  \ felt the importance to find out another lifestyle free from the money. Above all,\
  \ he wants to set an example for the village people showing that another lifestyle\
  \ is possible, that they can fight the desertification through the cultivation.\
  \ There's no need to flee M'hamid because of lack of work, but it's necessary to\
  \ find out solutions keeping that natural treasure.\nTo make his dream come true,\
  \ he sold his camels to buy 2 hectares of farmland in a Palm Oasis. Today, \"La\
  \ ferme aux portes du d\xE9sert\" is a project that lives thanks to the help of\
  \ travellers. It's a beautiful and magical place to stay: the lemon and orange trees\
  \ grow up under the Palm Trees, there are smart systems for the water extraction,\
  \ the passion for the permaculture and cultural exchange, Berber carpets everywhere,\
  \ many chill outdoors zones, some animals and a Big Kitchen with excellent local\
  \ food...\nFor a few years wwoofers from all over the world arrived in this farm,\
  \ making happier and happier this little Oasis of peace with new ideas.\nThere's\
  \ still and always a lot to do. Everyone's welcome with joy."
