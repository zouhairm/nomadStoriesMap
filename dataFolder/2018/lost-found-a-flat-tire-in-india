Text: "We were singing a local Indian music out loud, without any idea of the lyrics,\
  \ of course! but very excited to be there, when Nathu, our very experimented but\
  \ a little crazy and very funny local driver said to us, guys we have problems again!\n\
  \nSo there we were! 10 people in the middle of the nowhere in India with the flat\
  \ tire, 34\xBAC degrees and just some hot bottles of beer.\nIt was our second flat\
  \ tire in the day. So we went out off the van one by one very disappointed. We were\
  \ outside without air-conditioned and next to a train stop on our way to Ranakpur.\
  \ That day we were travelling around 7 hours because we wanted to visit the sacred\
  \ temple of Ranakpur, one of the most beautiful places I can remember about our\
  \ trip in the north of India, in the Rajasthan area, a place well know by travellers\
  \ around the world, because of the famous palaces of the Maraharas, the Indian royalty.\n\
  \nMeanwhile, a train was passing and the road was closed for the cars, so there\
  \ was a lot of motorcycles, buses, tractors with people above and many cars, waiting\
  \ at the stop. My group of friends and I were watching them and they were watching\
  \ at us: the sari's colors, the deep eyes, the unrecognizable words, but the mutual\
  \ smiles. They wanted a photo with us and we wanted a photo of them: the reciprocal\
  \ and loving admiration was floating in the warm ambient that morning in August.\n\
  \nSuddenly, while we were waiting for Nathu to come back with a new tire, a principal\
  \ from a local school got closed to us and invite us to go the school he runs.We\
  \ were kind of surprised about the invitation and we really didn't know what to\
  \ say but he saw the confusion on our faces and he exclaimed the kids would be so\
  \ happy to see you! \n\nWe told him that it was impossible to go because we cant\
  \ move the van and he claimed: oh don't worry I will pick you up on the school bus.\n\
  And there it was! an authentic yellow school bus ready to take us to a local school\
  \ in India: a wonderful place full of beautiful smiles with the power to erase all\
  \ the tiredness of three weeks.\n\nIn that moment when you feel nothing can go worse\
  \ in the middle of a trip, you can find the most unexpected and emotive experiences.\n\
  Not even in our best dreams, we can imagine the lucky we had to be there in that\
  \ moment. The connection we had with locals and the way we could learn how they\
  \ live, and what really makes India a great country, was the solidarity. \n\nI truly\
  \ recommend you going to a country and get lost if you want to find out something\
  \ true."
