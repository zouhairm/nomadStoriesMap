Text: "\u201CIt\u2019s not safe to walk these paths alone!\u201D An elderly lady appeared\
  \ from behind a boulder, following closely behind a small herd of goats. She tapped\
  \ at their ankles with a bamboo stick, keeping them on track. \u201CAre you lost?\u201D\
  \ I turned to see that I had fallen far behind the group, with enough distance between\
  \ us for the villager to assume I was alone.\n\nI was mesmerised by the scenery.\
  \ Every bend along the trail had me in awe, each more beautiful than the last. The\
  \ cascading mountains seemed to go on forever, perfectly crafted as if sketched\
  \ into the skyline. Click. The sound of my camera shutter broke the silence. It\
  \ was so peaceful.\n\nI glanced down over the edge to see the water. Beads of sweat\
  \ began to roll down the side of my face. Frozen and petrified, a chill shot down\
  \ my spine. My one true fear: heights. \u201CXiaojie, watch it! Or you\u2019ll be\
  \ drinking the water!\u201D Anxiously I stepped away from the edge, thanked the\
  \ villager and hurried off to catch up with my friends.\n\nIt was day two into the\
  \ hike of the Tiger Leaping Gorge. After conquering the steep climb up the mountain\
  \ the day before, our tired legs struggled down the muddy descent to the water.\
  \ The low growls of the river were deafening, coming to life as it echoed through\
  \ the valley as if the gorge was demanding our respect.\n\nThe excitement was suddenly\
  \ cut short when we realised that the last bus to town was departing within the\
  \ hour. Hastily we considered returning the way we came. The incline was strenuous,\
  \ with no guarantee we would arrive in time. An old local man sitting nearby the\
  \ river laughed at us. \u201CTake the Sky Ladder, it's the faster route. Though\
  \ people have fallen off before and have never been found again.\u201D\n\nThe 170-step\
  \ ladder shot up to the sky, bolted haphazardly onto the cliff face, hanging over\
  \ the water. My stomach sunk. Time was running out and my excuses were of no concern\
  \ to my friends.\n\nI took a deep breath, mustered all my strength and began to\
  \ climb. The wind howled and the river roared. \u201CDon\u2019t look down\u201D\
  . My hands were shaking and beginning to numb. Blisters surfaced as they clasped\
  \ tightly onto the bars. \u201CDon\u2019t look down\u201D. Taking in slow breaths,\
  \ I continued to climb. It felt like an eternity.\n\nMy eyes finally met the surface\
  \ of the ground. I scrambled up the remaining steps and collapsed to the floor,\
  \ exhausted. I smiled up at the sky thinking about what I had just accomplished,\
  \ until I noticed my friend giggling. She smirked, \u201CWe were never going to\
  \ make the bus anyway\"."
