Text: "It\u2019s just past noon when a sturdy woman slides into a plastic lawn chair\
  \ across from me. The Nicaraguan sun radiates over our physical exam station, but\
  \ her weathered skin doesn\u2019t seem to notice. Like most of the patients who\
  \ make the pilgrimage to this clinic, she\u2019s been waiting since the crack of\
  \ dawn to be seen by a Canadian medical team. Despite her size, she has a gentle\
  \ spirit, and I can\u2019t help but grin. I\u2019m on a tropical island in the middle\
  \ of Central America, and I\u2019m about to examine my first patient. Ever. \n\n\
  The island of Ometepe rises out of Lake Nicaragua, flanked by the peaks of the Concepci\xF3\
  n and Maderas volcanoes. It is home to more than 40,000 people who depend on agriculture\
  \ and a burgeoning tourism industry for survival. Los Angeles, the town that houses\
  \ our clinic is poor, but hauntingly beautiful.  An ancient cemetery announces your\
  \ arrival, children and cows share a playground in the dusty streets, and open doors\
  \ require only a greeting to enter. Life slows down here. \n\nI focus on my patient.\
  \ \u201C\xBFComo se llama?\u201D I say. \n\nShe mumbles a name that I don\u2019\
  t understand, and my confidence wavers. \n\n\u201C\xBFD\xF3nde vives?\u201D I try.\
  \ \n\nEither my accent is horrible, or she doesn\u2019t seem to remember where she\
  \ lives.  \n\nWe go through the checklist of the physical exam in my broken Spanish.\
  \ Some parts go better than others. \u201CWhat kind of doctor will I be if I can\u2019\
  t even see down her throat?\u201D I mentally groan. \u201CIs she really missing\
  \ an eye, or has she just been squinting into the sun for so many years her lids\
  \ are melted shut?\u201D \n\nWhen I'm finally finished,  she hands me a small bag\
  \ full of lemons. \u201CLim\xF3n! Vitamina!\u201D she says.\n\nThinking that she\
  \ wants to show me what she eats, I nod and hand it back, but she won\u2019t take\
  \ it. I\u2019ve had months of physical exam practice at school, but nobody taught\
  \ me what to do with a bag of fruit. \n\nI find the head physician buzzing around\
  \ the dispensary. I hold up the bag and begin to explain. He just laughs. \u201C\
  You\u2019ve met Maria.\u201D\n\nMy body floods with relief that he knows her, and\
  \ then almost immediately with an awareness that brings goosebumps to my arms despite\
  \ the sauna like temperature. He explains that Maria makes the trek to Los Angeles\
  \ for every monthly clinic. In exchange for her exam, she brings fruit for us to\
  \ distribute as vitamins. Last month it was oranges.  \n\nI glance at the prescription\
  \ sheet in my hand, damp from sweat and complicated by ideas. None as simple and\
  \ effective as whole food. \n\nI have a lot to learn."
