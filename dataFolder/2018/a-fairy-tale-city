Text: "The back alleys of Bukhara formed a literal maze, narrow and convoluted in\
  \ their organization. After walking with a friend for about an hour, our path was\
  \ growing more and more difficult to navigate as the sun set and the shadows grew\
  \ longer. We came around a corner and almost ran into a man coming from another\
  \ direction. He sidled up next to us and said coldly in Russian, \u201CGood evening.\u201D\
  \ It must have been quite apparent to the man that we were foreigners and we had\
  \ read all the warnings about crime in the city. I was suddenly very conscious of\
  \ the man\u2019s proximity to us in the tight alley in the impending darkness. Perhaps\
  \ in an attempt to look like we weren\u2019t lost, we made another turn without\
  \ hesitation. The stranger turned as well. \u201CPleasant weather we\u2019re having,\
  \ isn\u2019t it?\u201D He smiled slyly and gave one good look over the young man\
  \ and young woman walking next to him, bundled tightly from head to toe. Though\
  \ my Russian is poor, I understood his joke and answered back, \u201CIt is excellent\
  \ weather! Though just a bit cold.\u201D The three of us laughed nervously together\
  \ for a moment and shivered deeper in our coats and scarves, although my retreat\
  \ wasn\u2019t entirely from the cold. The truth is it had been more than just a\
  \ bit cold before the sun went down, but the fresh air was enticing and my friend\
  \ had asked me to join on a walk. Now, in the shadows, as daylight slowly turned\
  \ to moonlight, it was downright freezing. We were alone and somewhat lost, so we\
  \ had just kept walking, realizing a growing tension but not yet acknowledging our\
  \ fears out loud. The man, still walking so close next to us, broke the silence\
  \ and asked, \u201CHow do you like our city?\u201D I hesitantly told him that I\
  \ loved it. The city was beautiful and the history fascinating. The man nodded and\
  \ said, \u201CYes, Bukhara is a 'gorod skazka.' Enjoy your stay.\u201D He winked\
  \ at me and abruptly dipped away around a corner, lowering his head to the sudden\
  \ light of street lamps. My friend stopped and put his hand on my arm. We smiled\
  \ at each other, resting in a moment of relief, before I whispered, \u201CYes, Bukhara\
  \ is a fairy tale city...\u201D We had come out of the alley just next to our guest\
  \ house, wallets and well-being still secure. The stranger had already disappeared\
  \ down the street into one of the ancient trading domes. As I looked after him the\
  \ lights shining from within sparkled and danced under the light of the lonely moon,\
  \ a welcome image of warmth and safety to foreigners adrift in the cold desert night."
