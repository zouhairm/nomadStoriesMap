Text: "I had always dreamed of travelling the world. \n\nHours of my life had been\
  \ dedicated to dreaming about and planning my grand adventures across the globe,\
  \ each moment desperately waiting to happen. It would seem, however, that time kept\
  \ passing by and I remained stranded in my hometown, the dreams I had of scouring\
  \ continents slipping further and further from my reach.  \n\nCape Town is a world-famously\
  \ beautiful city, bursting with sights, sounds, smells and activities. Although\
  \ I knew that I lived in a wonderland of adventure, the true depth of my city and\
  \ its roots were lost on me. \n\nI believed that I had seen and done it all in Cape\
  \ Town. The rest of the world was calling, begging, pleading with me to embrace\
  \ it with my entire being. I dreamed of seeing the bougainvillea's in Tuscany, smelling\
  \ the freshly-baked croissants in Paris, swimming in the cool waters of Santorini\
  \ - immersing myself in the experience of a shiny, new place. \n\nI began to see\
  \ Cape Town as a prison. I felt trapped. \n\nBut I would soon come to know that\
  \ my city was trying to teach me something. The lesson began in the heart of winter,\
  \ on a cold Saturday in June. In my naturally restless state, I called a friend\
  \ and suggested that we go out and find something to do. Roughly an hour later,\
  \ we found ourselves in a magical, mysterious place called Noordhoek Forest. \n\n\
  As we began exploring, I began to notice details within this place. The contrast\
  \ between the striking green colour of the soft, lush grass and the deep, dark green\
  \ of the leaves in the trees above me. I took a deep breath and smelled pine cones,\
  \ tree bark and the fresh, dewy air. I was enchanted.\n\nI started to wonder why\
  \ I had been so reluctant to give my city the credit it deserved. Its splendour,\
  \ I realised, was unending. No amount of time spent in a place as beautiful as this\
  \ would have ever been enough. Was my unwillingness to see the beauty purely a villain\
  \ of circumstance? Or had I become so consumed by wanderlust that an entire scape\
  \ of majestic beauty turned to grey in my eyes? I had finally made the connection.\
  \ \n\nMy lesson was so clear to me now: Find yourself in your city before finding\
  \ yourself within the world. \n\nFollowing the day I spent in that forest, I began\
  \ a new journey of discovery in Cape Town and I have learned more about myself.\
  \ Cape Town is a cultural melting pot, a natural life phenomenon and the home of\
  \ a spirited, dynamic people. \n\nBy finding myself in my city, I will know who\
  \ I am within the world."
