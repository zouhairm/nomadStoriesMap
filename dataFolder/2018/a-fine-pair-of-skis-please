Text: "It\u2019s a frosty morning in Chamonix. I flash a disapproving look at the\
  \ Christmas lights that are hung above the town\u2026in February. There are three\
  \ shops on one street from which I can hire my equipment. I choose the one with\
  \ a window display of black and white posters featuring a champion skier. Maybe\
  \ this is the shop where he used to get his gear from. Once inside, I begin to regret\
  \ my decision. The old man behind the desk is cheerful and clearly happy to see\
  \ me inside the otherwise empty shop, however, his English is about as good as my\
  \ French, which isn\u2019t good at all! He talks to me in French as I laugh nervously\
  \ and nod at the inaudible sounds coming from his mouth. The boots fit perfectly.\
  \ It is clear that neither of us understand one another, but it\u2019s nice to try\
  \ to communicate none-the-less. I point to him and then point to some skis, as if\
  \ to ask whether he will be out on the mountains. He laughs and shakes his head\
  \ before pointing to the worn leather armchair behind his desk. We exchange a smile\
  \ and a handshake before I head straight to the gondola. \n\nDays pass and there\
  \ isn\u2019t a valley that I have left undiscovered. The mountains that were once\
  \ unfamiliar, rugged shadows and shapes start to become familiar to me. My skis\
  \ carry me down the quiet slopes through pockets of trees. I breathe in the fresh\
  \ mountain air and as my lungs fill my spirits lift. This open space is the ultimate\
  \ therapy and I\u2019m still smiling when my ski gets stuck in a mogul and I slide\
  \ several metres down the piste on my face. I\u2019m about to unclip the ski that\
  \ miraculously stayed attached to my foot in order to hike up the slope to retrieve\
  \ the other. There is a skier flying down the slope. He is tackling the moguls with\
  \ ease and is totally in control despite the rocky conditions. He retrieves my ski\
  \ in one swift movement and with a graceful skid and a spray of white powder he\
  \ is at my side handing it to me. He peels back his goggles and laughs before tutting\
  \ and saying something that I can only imagine means \u201Cyou be careful with my\
  \ skis\u201D in French. With that, he was gliding down the piste again and out of\
  \ my view within moments. When it\u2019s time to return my skis to the shop, I suddenly\
  \ make the connection. I point at the black and white posters before pointing at\
  \ the kind-faced old man and raising my eyebrows in question. He laughs and claps\
  \ his hands together, before taking fifteen percent off my bill and chuckling as\
  \ he hands it to me. Well, that was the last thing I expected."
