Text: "Following our nonchalant guide with Dad and my brother, we climbed the shaded\
  \ forests winding trail. The hot air thinned and cooled, fog growing on the ascent,\
  \ creating a mystical quality. A rumble grew as the path disappeared. Only able\
  \ to see my arms, the rumble intensified.\nStepping out of the fog, I reached a\
  \ new world. The rivers current blew the cloud away to the sky and dominated the\
  \ path it cut through the Dominican green. We stepped into the river and began our\
  \ journeys descent.\nThe shocking cold water was forgotten while focusing on our\
  \ steps in the river. We were glad to rent the old water shoes. Worry of previously\
  \ users feet quickly forgotten while stepping on slippery rocks.\nWe stopped. The\
  \ river ended. It did continue, only after a 30 foot drop. The guide casually explained\
  \ how to jump in and waited. This was not expected. Dad and my brother argued about\
  \ the height and danger, trying to convince the other to not do it. Agreed, they\
  \ began to climb down around it.\nLooking at the long plunge, I decided. I\u2019\
  ll jump. They looked at me like I was crazy. Wasn\u2019t this the point?\n\nDads\
  \ mind quickly changed, claiming the right to go first. He walked the edge, readied\
  \ himself and jumped like a pencil into the pool. Safe, Dad excitedly yelled for\
  \ us to come down. My nervous brother couldn\u2019t refuse now, landing with a flop.\n\
  \nSlippery, I eased to the edge. Dad hooted, forgetting his pause (denying it to\
  \ this day). Standing in the rivers end, I looked down. Down the over thirty foot\
  \ drop into a tiny pool. I said I\u2019d do it, the first to offer, but hesitated.\
  \ Not because I was thinking about how the river was at its lull due to the season\
  \ and lack of rain. Not because I was biggest and had a better chance of crashing\
  \ on the pools bottom. And definitely, definitely not because I was scared of heights.\
  \ \nI\u2019m just cautious of height. Very, VERY, cautious.\nI took a deep breath.\n\
  Another deep breath.\nSeveral more breaths. I was getting annoyed. This was getting\
  \ ridiculous. Like all my life, I was overthinking. What was I waiting for? I made\
  \ the decision. I looked down, found my spot, and stepped out into nothing.\nFalling\
  \ like a rock, the air whipped at me. Legs straight. Arms in. Focused as the water\
  \ quickly came as my spot grew larger and larger.\nIn a rushing jolt, I crashed\
  \ through the liquid surface and submerged, knees bent and arms out to decelerate.\
  \ My feet hit the pools bottom. Low, but just enough water. Rising out of the water,\
  \ I returned my families smiles."
