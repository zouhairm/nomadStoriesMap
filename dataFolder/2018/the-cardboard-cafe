Text: "I was hungry; so I decided to take a small detour on my way from work. The\
  \ area of Rome's Via Nazionale is crammed with small cafes and international restaurants\
  \ -a good place to search for panini. As I walked up a small side street, I absentmindedly\
  \ shifted my gaze to and from the scores of menus and advertisements put out by\
  \ the food businesses. About half way up the street, I glanced to my right: tucked\
  \ away beyond the corner of a cul-de-sac, was a small and neat caf\xE9. Being a\
  \ Brit, my mind was predisposed to ignore it. In England, particularly London, caf\xE9\
  s that neat -with white wooden panels adorning the outside, and a name like Rosemary-\
  \ are likely to be ridiculously expensive vegan cafes. But my reason butted in.\
  \ In Italy, people rarely make an effort with how their businesses look. I wanted\
  \ to see what it meant when they did.\nAnd so, I flounced over to the door with\
  \ my haughty apprehension. I had only been browsing the menu (checking the prices)\
  \ outside the door, when a man, a veritable wine-swirler, interrupted my chain of\
  \ thoughts. He spoke to me in Italian, and I surprised myself by managing to keep\
  \ up my side of the conversation. When I said that I had a passion for languages,\
  \ and that I wanted to teach English, he got very excited. He said something about\
  \ following him, so I did. We entered Rosemary Caf\xE9, barging past people packed\
  \ beside the bar, side-stepped the quaint little tables of couples eating, turned\
  \ a corner, opened a door and proceeded down a flight of steps that dug underneath\
  \ the caf\xE9.\nI was beginning to review my thought that it was a good idea to\
  \ follow this stranger into a basement, when I saw something cardboard. In fact,\
  \ a whole chair made out of cardboard. Then as I ventured further, I found a whole\
  \ room made out of cardboard... chairs, coffee-tables, bookshelves and sculptures.\
  \ Even the walls were cladded with cardboard. The man, who turned out to be the\
  \ caf\xE9's owner, told me that it was his dream to make this space into a language\
  \ school, and asked me if I would like to be a teacher there. I was overjoyed!\n\
  As for the panino-hunt, I was not only successful in finding the Rubio (an aubergine,\
  \ tomato and goats cheese whole-wheat panino) but a tonne of other cheap and delicious\
  \ options for lunch. My initial pre-conceptions, by that time, felt like a world\
  \ away."
