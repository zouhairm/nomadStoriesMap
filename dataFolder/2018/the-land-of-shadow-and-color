Text: "I have always wanted to go to New Zealand. For its remarkable mountains, its\
  \ icing blue lakes and glaciers, its green hills and lupin flowers growing everywhere,\
  \ flashes of pink and purple along the roads. I knew that I would instantly fall\
  \ in love with it all. And I was not disappointed. The surprise however came from\
  \ a hike I did not plan on doing, a crossing through Tongariro National Park I booked\
  \ on a whim just the day before, a six hours trek through the land of shadow that\
  \ colored my world.\n\nWe started our 19.4 kilometers walk in the early hours of\
  \ the day, when the sky is still sleepy, a dark canvas with touches of lighter blue\
  \ brushstrokes. We were in Mordor, following the steps of two young hobbits on their\
  \ venture to Mount Doom. In the movies, Mordor is a dry land, cold and raw. What\
  \ I had in front of my eyes was something utterly different. \n\nThe hike begins\
  \ in the hollows of a valley of dry grass and grey rocks, by a stream. We walk on\
  \ a small wooden path. To our right, the imposing Ngauruhoe volcano, a black cone\
  \ of tephra and lava, red around the crater. The trail then narrows down and turns\
  \ into steep stairs. There are more people now, as the way up is long and it is\
  \ difficult to overtake. Some take breaks and look around. Others try not to, in\
  \ case they have trouble getting moving again. This is after all, the Devil\u2019\
  s staircase. But a hard track always leads to something extraordinary. And it\u2019\
  s all worth it. Reaching the top, I see them for the first time: emerald green lakes,\
  \ vivid color spots in an otherwise moonlike atmosphere. Stunning. \n\nThe ground\
  \ is slippery. It rained last night. We walk by the pools of green water and carry\
  \ on to the second part of the crossing, the long way down to Lake Rotoaira and\
  \ the Otukou valley, where our campervan awaits. A couple of hours hike in an entirely\
  \ different scenery: a single winding trail across a nestled valley. While the emerald\
  \ lakes were then the only bright colors, the sight is now as rich and vibrant as\
  \ one of Turner\u2019s watercolours. The sky has this perfect blue color of summer\
  \ days, its unity only broken by a white smoke emerging from the raw umber mountains.\
  \ Passed the valley, a dark green forest meets the sapphire blue of the lake. And\
  \ beyond, a palette of azure, turquoise, beaver and seal brown as far as the eye\
  \ can see."
