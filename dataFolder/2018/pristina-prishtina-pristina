Text: "Pristina in Kosovo is a moderately-sized capital city that makes for a great\
  \ base to explore the wider country. Having said that, it\u2019s worth spending\
  \ a day or two here to soak up a number of important sites that really help you\
  \ better understand the unique culture and recent history of Europe\u2019s youngest\
  \ capital city. \n\nKnown as \u2018Pristina\u2019 (English), \u2018Prishtina\u2019\
  \ (from the Albanian \u2018Prishtin\xEB\u2019) or \u2018Pri\u0161tina\u2019/\u2018\
  \u041F\u0440\u0438\u0448\u0442\u0438\u043D\u0430\u2019 (Serbian); the very fact\
  \ it goes by several names clearly alludes to it being the largest city in a disputed\
  \ territory. However, we felt nothing but safe here and were met by warm locals\
  \ eager to put the past behind them and leave us with fond memories of a city with\
  \ a bright future. \n\nWanting to further understand the turbulent history of this\
  \ small country, we headed to the Museum of Kosovo and were wowed by oversized posters\
  \ of wood carvings and intricate pottery outside, whetting our appetite for the\
  \ displays we were about to see. Inside was a different story. \n\nWalking in to\
  \ an almost empty room, we spent 30 seconds looking at a tank full of human remains,\
  \ before being approached by a museum assistant.\n\n\u201CIs this it?\u201D I said,\
  \ admittedly, a tad rudely.\n\n\u201COf course not!\u201D \n\nAlmost relieved, we\
  \ were whisked around the corner to a creaky staircase and were presented with a\
  \ gigantic portrait of Mother Teresa. \n\n\u201CThis is the largest staple mosaic\
  \ in the world,\u201D our host proudly exclaimed.\n\nI looked at my fianc\xE9, not\
  \ really sure how to react.\n\n\u201CLike staple staples?\u201D\n\n\u201CYeah\u201D\
  \n\n\u201COh. It\u2019s\u2026 it\u2019s\u2026 AMAZING!\u201D Maybe I was a bit too\
  \ enthusiastic, but our guide seemed to lap it up and, despite the absurdity of\
  \ the medium, it was very impressive. \n\nAlbanian artist Saimir Strati used 1.5\
  \ million staples to make the portrait and, astonishingly, this isn't his only Guinness\
  \ World Record; he also created the world's largest cork mosaic and the world's\
  \ largest drinking straw mosaic. Well, everyone's got to have a hobby.\n\nBack in\
  \ the Museum, I continued to climb the stairs, hoping to see some archaeological\
  \ and ethnographical delights, only for the assistant to tell me that was the end\
  \ of our tour. \n\n\u201CRenovations.\u201D \n\nStill, as we sulked our way back\
  \ outside, I did wonder why a large tour group was being ushered in when there was\
  \ so little to see. Perhaps a giant staple mosaic is a bigger drawer than I initially\
  \ thought."
