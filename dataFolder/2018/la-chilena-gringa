Text: "For me, the most exciting part of travelling alone is the opportunity to meet\
  \ new people. About a year ago, I was going to Chilote Island, Chile for a class\
  \ trip over spring break. Due to the price of the ticket, I decided to go down a\
  \ week early and spend a bit of time travelling around the Santiago area before\
  \ I met up with the class. I was initially a bit nervous, as it would be my first\
  \ time travelling alone in a South American country alone, but it turned out to\
  \ be one of the best travel experiences I have had to date.\nToday was the day that\
  \ I was going to hike Vulcan Osurno. I had finally found my hostal in Puerto Varas\
  \ (after quite a bit of searching), and inquired about the conditions on the mountain.\
  \ I was told that the tours were not going out due to the fog and inclement weather,\
  \ but a bus left for the area daily. I decided to take my chances. The next day\
  \ I boarded the bus (after searching for 15 mins and using my half decent Spanish\
  \ to ask for directions), and we started off. The road was beautiful, next to the\
  \ sea for the majority of the way, and crossing through lush farms and beautiful\
  \ mountainous terrain. Somehow, the rickety bus crossed a shallow river without\
  \ getting stuck in the mud, and eventually we arrived at the base of the volcano.\
  \ I signed in with the warden on duty-a jovial man who provided some advice, and\
  \ bade me good luck, and then headed off. While I was hiking, I met a group of 3\
  \ from Germany, and we became fast friends-joking about what we would do when we\
  \ got lost and stranded out here. Eventually we reached a peak, and the view was\
  \ incredible. Eventually, they continued onward while I stayed and ate my delicious\
  \ lunch of an avocado sandwich and admired the incredible view-a breathtaking lake\
  \ on one side and the jagged profile of the volcano on the other, a perfect contrast.\
  \ It was silent, save for the wind whipping through the trees and the occasional\
  \ melody of the songbirds. The weather had cleared up enough so that the top of\
  \ the volcano was just visible in the intervals between the cotton candy clouds,\
  \ and indicator in the back of my mind that rain was in the forecast. I met another\
  \ backpacker atop my ledge, and we conversed in Spanish, forming a 30 minute bond\
  \ over this wilderness that somehow felt more real than some friendships that I\
  \ have had for years. At one point, he asked me if I was from Chile.\nI wish, I\
  \ responded, I'm from the United States. \nToday you are a Chilean, he said. Estas\
  \ la Chilena gringa."
