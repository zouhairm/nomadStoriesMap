Text: "When I was 18, I decided to save $50 per month throughout college to accomplish\
  \ my second life goal to backpack across Europe as my graduation present to myself.\
  \ My first dream was to graduate as a 1st generation, low-income student from UCLA.\
  \ As a Bruin alum at 21, I took my $2400 (the most money I\u2019d seen at the time)\
  \ and bought a round trip flight from Los Angeles to Heathrow, a Eurail pass, a\
  \ passport and stepped into my heart\u2019s longing with little plan but to meet\
  \ up with two friends from college who were studying abroad.\n\nWhen I arrived in\
  \ Heathrow, my fascination with \u201CMinding the Gap\u201D was quickly replaced\
  \ by panic when I realized I had left my debit card\u2014and only means of finance\u2014\
  on the table at home. There was nothing I could do but surrender to the travel gods\u2019\
  \ will. Luckily, my mom happened to stick $400 cash in my pocket, which lasted me\
  \ a week until she could ship my card to my friend\u2019s house in Stuttgart. \n\
  \nThe last thing I expected was to find freedom in depending on the kindness of\
  \ strangers, meaning in the unexpected, and belonging 6000 miles from home. \n\n\
  The urgency that comes from being immersed in unfamiliar languages and cultures\
  \ created a portal in which I, somehow, could have decipherable 20-minute conversations\
  \ with people speaking French and Italian to me, while I spoke broken Spanish back.\
  \ I\u2019m pretty sure I was propositioned in Paris by a septuagenarian who looked\
  \ like Sidney Poitier and I learned all about my bus driver living in a home down\
  \ the street from his wife in Florence as we whipped around single-lane switchbacks.\
  \ I stumbled into Oktoberfest and happened upon the annual free Louvre admission\
  \ day and saw some of the very art that had captivated me in art history books.\
  \ \n\nWhether in London, befriended by a photographer who took me to see Parliament,\
  \ Paris, taken to dinner by two women from Hawaii traveling for their 40th birthdays,\
  \ running into the same Gaelic-speaking ladies in both Milan and later in Cinque\
  \ Terre, or saving a night of hostel money on an overnight train to Spain where\
  \ 3 young women from Wisconsin took me into their chamber when they saw it would\
  \ be safer for me, it was like a Divine Hand had guided my trip far better than\
  \ I could have ever planned.\n\nI never expected to feel more at home in my skin\
  \ 6000 miles from home in an unincorporated travel community that values humanity\
  \ and diversity or that I\u2019d wanderlust for the magic of international travel\
  \ for the next 20 years. I\u2019m ready for the next adventure!"
