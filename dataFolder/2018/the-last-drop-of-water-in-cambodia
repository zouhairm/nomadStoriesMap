Text: "On the first day, my friends and I, carrying the most fashionable camera, ran\
  \ and climbed up the top of Angkor Wat excitedly and saw the sunset of the whole\
  \ Cambodia. When we walked down the sky ladder, we felt unbelievable and scared\
  \ of how high we just climbed and was not dare to look down.\n\nOn the second day,\
  \ we woke up at 2am with our sleepy eyes and thrilled heart, and prepared to take\
  \ the same tuk-tuk to see the sunrise of Cambodia. When the driver came, he negotiated\
  \ with us for the set price we had decided the day before. He tried to increase\
  \ the price a lot. We did not compromise with the driver because we thought that\
  \ was the integrity problems.  \n\nWe then decided to walk slowly along the street\
  \ on foot and explored secretly the mysterious parts of Cambodia. We strolled down\
  \ to the shabby school, eccentric architecture, and \u201Cforest and sand\u201D\
  . We saw a lot of happy and simple-hearted children yelling \u201Cone dollar, one\
  \ dollar\u201D, \u201C\u4E00\u7F8E\u5143\u201D, and \u201Cun dollar\u201D. They\
  \ ran quickly and laughed out loudly. \n\nOne thing most visitors concern about\
  \ travelling in Cambodia is landmine. Some people say \u201Cif there is no road\
  \ in Cambodia, don't step your foot in that area.\u201D We just like na\xEFve kids\
  \ and wandered every corner of Cambodia bravely and fearlessly. We stepped in every\
  \ place we arrived and talked to almost everyone we encountered. We saw and learnt\
  \ a lot. \n\nBUT one scary situation happened \u2013 \u201COh no, my bottle ran\
  \ out of water soon, I just left a last drop of water\u201D. \n\nWe were so worried.\
  \ We kept walked, walked and walked. All we can see surrounding us are trees, sand\
  \ and nothing. We were not dare to drink our last drop of water and just tolerated\
  \ to thirsty harshly. After one hour, two hours and three hours, we discovered the\
  \ \u201COASIS IN THE DESERT\u201D surprisingly and believed we saw the \u201CMIRAGE\u201D\
  . \n\nWe found a street market and our treasure \u2013 a can of COKE. We paid immediately\
  \ and drank like a pig quickly. \n\nFrom this trip, we learnt to cherish everything\
  \ we have as we do not know what happen for the next minute and we are not entitle\
  \ to take everything for granted, we need to work hard to get what we want."
