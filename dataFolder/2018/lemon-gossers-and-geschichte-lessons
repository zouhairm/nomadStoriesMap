Text: "My best history lesson came from a bar in Berlin. I found myself in a bar promising\
  \ the presence of \u201CKings and Queens and Criminal Queers\u201D, sipping a lemon\
  \ beer with a local film student. Under a haze of cigarette smoke, I broached the\
  \ subject which brought me to Berlin, and the least polite question you can ask\
  \ a German \u2013 how were you taught about the Second World War? As if discussing\
  \ something as mundane as the weather, she recounted how the darkest moments of\
  \ the twentieth century were woven into curriculum across her education career.\
  \ Her candor was culture shock for someone raised in the U.S. South. Historical\
  \ reminders are embedded on every corner in Berlin \u2013 parks full of memorials:\
  \ Graffiti etched by Soviets preserved on the Reichstag walls: Stolperstein, stumbling\
  \ blocks, where a glance at your shoes reveals a brass gilded victim\u2019s name.\
  \ \nHistory in Berlin does not apologize. A thought I could not put to rest when\
  \ I returned home to the University of Texas at Austin, where the debate over the\
  \ last few remaining Confederate statues raged on. Memorials and history did not\
  \ make for polite dinner time conversation, and certainly would not be discussed\
  \ with the same coolness the young Berliner had. Her parents did not arrive from\
  \ Vietnam to Germany until the 1970s, but the impact of a history her bloodline\
  \ never saw firsthand was never a question. When I asked about if she ever felt\
  \ exempt from pointed history lessons, she simply shook her head and said \u201C\
  Without it, I wouldn\u2019t be here.\u201D Because if Hitler had not invaded Poland,\
  \ there would have been no division of Germany at Potsdam. Without a Cold War, there\
  \ would be no relocation of Vietnamese refugees. If the world did not have a century\u2019\
  s worth of conflict and destruction and rebuilding, there would be no world where\
  \ a Texan student studying WWII would come to a capital city painted in memory.\
  \ I cannot say I traced my country\u2019s sins out like a map starting with the\
  \ dark recesses of history and ending with where I am now. Which is maybe what we\
  \ Americans could take from Germans, a lesson in sitting in discomfort and charting\
  \ out repercussions. \nMaybe there is a future some one hundred years out where\
  \ Germans discuss WWII and the Holocaust in the simplistic black and white terms\
  \ my school outlined the Civil War. Where Volksdeutsche looks a lot like Southern\
  \ Pride. Where will Germany will be when time passes over like an anesthetic into\
  \ the next century?"
