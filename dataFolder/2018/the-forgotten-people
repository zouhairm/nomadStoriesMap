Text: "\u201CWhat did I get myself into?!\u201D was the first thing that popped into\
  \ my head as we climbed a wall up to the ruins of an old, colonial style building.\
  \ It was still hot even though it was almost 9 pm and the air smelled like urine\
  \ and trash. Ten minutes earlier, we had just finished dinner in an elegant restaurant\
  \ and now here I was: Climbing walls in Salvador da Bahia, Brazil with my local\
  \ travel companion Jan, a German painter who moved here about a year ago. \n\u201C\
  No need to be afraid, just make sure to put your camera away, it\u2019s safer that\
  \ way\u201D he told me. The ruins we were about to enter are the home of people\
  \ who are addicted to crack. In Brazil, approximately two million people suffer\
  \ from a crack addiction, which represents 20% of the worldwide consumption and\
  \ puts Brazil on top of the ranking list. \nCarefully I looked around, getting my\
  \ bearings and trying to get used to the surroundings. There was trash everywhere\
  \ and cats were running around chasing the numerous rats. It was dark and even though\
  \ I couldn\u2019t see properly, I couldn\u2019t think of any place more inhumane\
  \ to live in. \n\u201COi! Amigo!\u201D a woman yelled at us. Jan knows the people\
  \ who live there because he had painted the city from the ruins\u2019 perspective.\
  \ The view from here can be pretty spectacular. In the dark I was able to make out\
  \ five people sitting in one \u201Croom\u201D of the ruins. We talked to the people\
  \ for a while; all of them were preparing their pipes to get high one last time\
  \ before they go to sleep. The woman showed us her new haircut. She told us, how\
  \ sad she was that her hair needed to be cut off, but it had been so dirty and filthy\
  \ that she decided it was about time to get a haircut. \n\u201C\xC9 a sua amiga?\u201D\
  \ she asked Jan, pointing at me. \n\u201CSim\u201D Jan answered, and she gave me\
  \ a friendly laughter, showing the few teeth she had left.\nAs she stood there in\
  \ the moonlight I was able to see her full appearance. She was skinny and wore a\
  \ kid\u2019s pyjama t-shirt that said \u201COnly at night you can see the stars\u201D\
  . The sad irony of the situation hit me straight in the face. The innocent message\
  \ on a kid\u2019s pyjama t-shirt; worn by a woman who had been forgotten and left\
  \ behind by society and the state and who will probably never get out of those ruins\
  \ again. \n\u201CBoa noite!\u201D We waved as we said good night to the ruin\u2019\
  s residents, leaving them to go back to Jan\u2019s apartment where the only animal\
  \ one could come across, is a cockroach and where I had a comfortable sofa to sleep\
  \ on. The difference couldn\u2019t be any bigger."
