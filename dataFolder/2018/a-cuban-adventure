Text: "I used to be very scared of the ocean, being on a boat or even in a swimming\
  \ pool. Although I decided that fear would not be an obstacle in achieving new experiences\
  \ or stopping me to live the life I wanted. It was a long and arduos journey to\
  \ learn how to swim and years later, to scuba dive. \nAfter becoming a certified\
  \ scuba diver I went to Varadero - Cuba for my first open water dive. And I went\
  \ by myself as my dive buddy who I did the course with got sick and could not join\
  \ me. Before my dive, I made sure my dive guide was aware it was my first ocean\
  \ dive and I was worried because it was a beach rather than a boat dive, which can\
  \ be easier when getting into the water. \nAfter crossing strongs waves, descending\
  \ and equalization and achieving neutral buoyancy I was finally diving. What a wonderful\
  \ sensation! Clear water, good visibility and many colourful fishes around us as\
  \ our group swam between the reef. I was delighted with the underwater world and\
  \ stopped many times to take photos until I noticed I was alone. I could no longer\
  \ see where the group was and at that moment I almost had a pancik attack. I remembered\
  \ my lessons and that the despair is diver\u2019s worst enemy. Many have drowned\
  \ because of it. And I also realised that if I had chosen a wrong decision it could\
  \ had change the whole course of my life. With no dive experience at all, I needed\
  \ to swim to the beach to save my life.\nWhile I waited for someone to come back,\
  \ I started to breath slowly to calm down and think the best solution to take me\
  \ back to the beach safely. As no one had come  after few minutes, I surfaced in\
  \ the hope someone was waiting. But nobody was there. The sea was really rough and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t see the direction of the beach. \nMinutes later, I saw the top\
  \ of a palm tree and I knew to where I needed to swim. I dived again but the reef\
  \ walls now looked like a labyrinth. My air was running low fast due to my efforts\
  \ to swim against the current. I needed to reach the beach as soon as possible as\
  \ I was starting to get really tired. I swam as quick as I could as the waves pushed\
  \ me in and held onto the rocks as the waves went back.\nI reached the beach completely\
  \ exhausted. What was important to me in this experience? To be calm and remember\
  \ the instructions for a safe dive. Never dive without a buddy you trust. Choose\
  \ a good dive centre with experienced and accredited guides. Finally, trust yourself\
  \ and never let the fear guide your decision without a good reason to."
