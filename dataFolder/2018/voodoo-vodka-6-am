Text: "She woke me up before the dawn-excited and a bit high, asked for a cigarette.\
  \ For a while we smoked in silence. The world outside the house was grey.\n-How\
  \ was the night? \u2013I said.\nShe jumped into some gossips about her friends but\
  \ suddenly stopped short and looked into my eyes:\n-Do you believe in voodoo?\n\
  -Nico, listen\u2026Well, yes\u2026but this is not for me.\n-I do. I met this guy\
  \ in the club-Voodoo guy from Cuba, you know. He can help with my past, you know\u2026\
  \nThat winter, too lost to go back home, I lived out of my friends\u2019 places\
  \ between Dominican Republic and Florida. Now in San Juan, Puerto Rico, two musicians\
  \ let me stay in their house for a small rent. One day Nico appeared there-she had\
  \ no place to go, some tragedy in the past and a broken heart. \n\nThe guy waited\
  \ outside in an old silver car. Just a tired latino. He didn\u2019t mind my presence\
  \ at all. He owned a house somewhere in the outskirts of the town where he lived\
  \ with his friend. A simple house, a pool, no signs of voodoo.\n-Girls, welcome!\
  \ Try our special drink from Cuba-this is fruit macerated in\u2026vodka. Vodka!\
  \ Exciting, right? \nIt was 6 am and I still don\u2019t know what he hoped for:\
  \ I am Russian, I drink. And i was drinking. Nico was silent, she waited patiently\
  \ for her time to ask questions.\n-Do you believe in voodoo? \u2013 Again.\n-No.\
  \ Actually I don\u2019t. And I don\u2019t want you to try your voodoo on me. It\u2019\
  s important.\n-No,no! I\u2019ll just check your energy, may I? \u2013 The voodoo\
  \ guy looked innocent enough to believe him.   \nProbably I was drunk, probably\
  \ curiosity made me follow him into a dark bedroom and lie down on a bed covered\
  \ with a cheap duvet. Up\u2026his hands were travelling from my belly up to\u2026\
  \n-Excuse me! This is enough.- I jumped on to my feet ready to run.\n-Wait, I\u2019\
  m sorry! You have good energy-we can have a business together\u2026wait!\n-Nice,\
  \ I will think about it. Any vodka left?\nHe sent his friend for another bottle\
  \ of Smirnoff and we killed it as well. Then he drove us home. Nico didn\u2019t\
  \ get her answers that time. So she returned. \n\nOne month later we were standing\
  \ on the beach sharing a bottle of rum. It was my last night in San Juan, this time\
  \ I really wanted to go. Nico looked at me- starlight in her eyes- and said quietly:\n\
  -Do you remember that guy from Cuba? Voodoo guy?\n-Sure. Why? \n-He raped me. He\
  \ said that it was a part of the healing. He said he wanted to help. But it felt\
  \ wrong. He lied to me. \nI was looking at the dark ocean in front of me. My eyes\
  \ were wet but I didn\u2019t cry. I am not emotional."
