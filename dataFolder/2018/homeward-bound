Text: "'' We will have to wait for complete darkness, a cloudy night with no moon\
  \ or stars.'' We were walking through a dense green forest in the Queen Charlotte\
  \ Sound. It was still early and dew clung to the vines and dripped softly onto the\
  \ moss beneath our feet. Tahi was explaining the conditions necessary to have a\
  \ ''phosphorus'' swim in the evening. \n\nI had been back in New Zealand for a month,\
  \ after six years traveling through Europe. Things were different back home and\
  \ I realised that I hadn't ever travelled in my own country. That's how I ended\
  \ up in Endeavour Inlet. The beautiful little place is only accesible by boat, there\
  \ are no roads or cars, only towering green trees and stony beaches. I met Tahi\
  \ and his family while staying at a small backpackers, they were locals, living\
  \ in one of the few houses along the beach. \n\n''Too bad, looks like it'll be clear\
  \ tonight,'' I said. \n\n''Yeah, oh well, we can get some beers and have a bbq on\
  \ the beach with my folks,''. \n\nThat night we sat about on the old rocks, listening\
  \ to the gentle lapping of the sea upon boats and stone. I watched the sun begin\
  \ to sink and a pale pink light washed over the beach. Tahi passed me a beer while\
  \ his mother sung softly and his father continued to fry up fresh fish over the\
  \ fire. As any seasoned traveller knows, home is not just a sense of place, but\
  \ also of time. After a trip you cannot ''go back home,'' you and your eyes are\
  \ too changed. And though you can never really see your home in the same way, remnants\
  \ of it can be found in favourable circumstances. I thanked the family for dinner\
  \ and went to bed.\n\n''Ahh, get off!''\n\n''What are you doing?!''\n\nTahi was\
  \ shaking me awake.\n\n'' There is a storm!'' he cried gleefully. ''Quick, get your\
  \ togs!''\n\nWe ran towards the beach. Dark rain clouds hung in the sky, obscuring\
  \ any light from the moon and stars. \n\n''Lets go!'' He motioned anxiously. \n\n\
  Ribbons of rain pelted the dark swirling sea and splattered into beautiful flashes\
  \ of light. Leaping from the jetty, I plunged into the shining liquid sky beneath\
  \ me and gasped. The icy water seemed to burn my skin. Tahi leapt into the ocean\
  \ next to me leaving a brilliant sparkling splash. With every move through the water\
  \ we saw flashes of the bioluminesence. I swam to the shore, watching the lights\
  \ glimmer on the pebbles every time waves softly broke. Lying in bed I thought I\
  \ would have to thank Tahi and his family again, they had given me something I thought\
  \ I had lost for good."
