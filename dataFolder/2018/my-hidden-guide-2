Text: "The Rockies, I have always heard snowy tales about those mountains. I even\
  \ had a 2000 piece puzzle at home with an amazing view of the place that just let\
  \ your mind wonder of the amazing stories surrounding it. I never thought I'd get\
  \ to see them... But traveling, cool girlfriend and luck made it possible.\nAfter\
  \ traveling to Seattle, I decided to head north, to meet my beloved girlfriend.\
  \ After soaking in sunny Vancouver and getting my first ever tattoo, the Rockies\
  \ are awaiting. Through Couchsurfing, which is a website to find hosts and travelers\
  \ in every country in the world, my girlfriend found a German guy traveling through\
  \ the Rockies with a car and looking to share a ride with adventurous souls. I was\
  \ skeptical at first as the journey would be two weeks through the cold with complete\
  \ strangers. But an inner voice told me: \"What would I do if I weren't afraid?\"\
  \ , \"Where would I find myself if I would not let doubt and fear be the heroes\
  \ of my story? \"- The rocky mountains. \nDriving in the car full of bags and equipment\
  \ for the journey we squeezed and head towards Banff: four different nationalities\
  \ that decided to emerge in this snowy adventure. The first night will be remembered\
  \ for a long time: chill night air sneaking in and freezing every bone covered with\
  \ countless clothes and improvised blankets. My tent neighbor offering some heat\
  \ but not enough to fall into the realm of dreams. Waking up the next day surrounded\
  \ by a white blanket of snow and feeling ten years older, we started our first hike.\
  \ I found a reliable stick named \"George\" - it looked like a George - and step\
  \ by step, we started to climb this greenish-whitish giant, after passing a mesmerizing\
  \ lake with pale blue water that seemed out of this world.\nHiking through the Rockies\
  \ takes trust. Trust in yourself, in whatever awaiting you at the end. And climbing\
  \ through the snow and the coldest air your lungs ever encountered... You feel it.\
  \ This moment, you smile... Walk around and let this feeling of satisfaction flow\
  \ through you. The view seems like it was photoshopped, did I see that view before?\
  \ Perhaps in some old puzzle? The colors mixed perfectly with the never-ending snow\
  \ making the colorful contrast alive. Thinking back on the freezing cold and sleepless\
  \ nights, the improvised meals around the fire, no connection to civilization and\
  \ the fear of stumbling across a lost mama bear: it all makes sense now. On top\
  \ of this snowy mountain, fear became my guide and not my enemy."
