Text: "The evening air is heavy like it's the tropics when I step into the cab line\
  \ at Newark airport. When we dive into the Lincoln tunnel it has turned into big\
  \ drops of late summer rain. New York City in August.\n\nI love coming back here,\
  \ love the city for all that passes outside my window: the crowds, the 24/7 life,\
  \ the much-needed dash of park greens amidst concrete, the puddles that flood crossings\
  \ when it rains. Air here is full of opportunity like no place else.\n\nThis time,\
  \ I let quintessential New York fade into the background, even if I want to yell\
  \ \"STOP!\" and take to the midtown streets. I am heading uptown for something different.\
  \ My friend Samir has invited me to share a red pot of goodness with four strangers\
  \ who have booked to Eat With Samir*. Some say New Yorkers are harsh, too rushed\
  \ for kindness and kinship. Samir is anything but, opening his doors and learning\
  \ how to live and love from everyone he crosses paths with.\n\nI first met Samir\
  \ when I walked into a sunny Quaker room on a Saturday morning in 2011. A friend\
  \ had pointed me to Citylights, a group that gathers to talk spirituality, share\
  \ stories and spread love into the city they call home. Samir was there, talking\
  \ about embracing the unexpected, singing about New York, smiling wide. \n\nNow\
  \ in his kitchen, glad to shed my bags and dry up after the humid jungle outside,\
  \ I\u2019m welcomed with the same smile. Come, sit, sip! I revel in the invitation\
  \ and the view of Frederick Douglass Blvd below us\u2014a bustling Harlem vein where\
  \ generations-old Harlemites and hip newcomers mix\u2014as I breathe in herbal tea\
  \ that is still too hot to drink. My senses are awakened by new faces, the scent\
  \ of Bosnian sarma, and the tidbits of daily talk Samir and his wife share as they\
  \ cook: \u201CI requested the weeks off, so we can book flights soon.\u201D The\
  \ family\u2019s annual trip to their roots in Croatia is being planned. \"Hand me\
  \ the paprika?\u201D\n\nSoon the table is set, guests gather around it, and we feast.\
  \ It is all superb: soft, smokey cabbage rolls, freshly baked brittle bread, wine\
  \ carefully selected for the occasion. Above it all, our host beams with passion:\
  \ caring for each bite we take, loving us through his food.\n\nLater, I look Samir\
  \ up online. Turns out, \u201Cwhen[ever] the going gets tough,\u201D this son of\
  \ Socialist Croatia turned pastor turned community builder and life coach \u201C\
  goes into his kitchen and cooks up kindness for family, friends, and strangers.\u201D\
  \ It strikes me as lovely added flavor to the melting pot.\n\n*See eatwith.com"
