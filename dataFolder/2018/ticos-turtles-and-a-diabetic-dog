Text: "I stepped off the makeshift riverboat and stared quizzically at the squat,\
  \ middle-aged man who welcomed me to this remote corner of Costa Rica.\n\nSix months\
  \ earlier, I had ventured into town to buy a Kindle. After a lengthy discussion\
  \ with a salesman, I had left (Kindle-less) with a list of his must-visit destinations\
  \ in Costa Rica. Chief among them: a secluded turtle sanctuary, eighty miles from\
  \ the capital. Using the remains of my student loan, I booked a trip from Belfast\
  \ to San Jos\xE9.\n\nThree flights, two buses and one hair-raising boat trip later,\
  \ I found myself standing on the paradisiacal shores of Costa Rica\u2019s Caribbean\
  \ coast, arm-in-arm with Rob \u2013 a jaunty, topless Welshman.\n\nRob lived on\
  \ a small stretch of land, accessible only by boat and over an hour from the nearest\
  \ town. He ushered me into a seat on his sun-drenched veranda and, in his lilting\
  \ valleys accent, inducted me into the basics of island life. The first aid box\
  \ was in the kitchen, the tap water was most definitely \"no potable\" and the lack\
  \ of electricity meant I would be sticking to a strict veggie diet. He briefly explained\
  \ how to tackle rip tides (don\u2019t panic; avoid the sharks), casually described\
  \ how to tell which snakes were venomous (most of them) and warned me about a recently-sighted\
  \ jaguar (\u201CDon\u2019t worry my lovely, it most likely won\u2019t come near\
  \ us\u201D). \n\nRob also confessed nonchalantly that Alfie, the mischievous kitten\
  \ meandering around the garden, was in fact Alfie II \u2013 his namesake had been\
  \ eaten by a crocodile the week before. As the terror set in, my host finished with\
  \ a dramatic flourish: \u201Cmost importantly, please don\u2019t feed my dog, Vicky\
  \ \u2013 she\u2019s diabetic.\u201D None of this had appeared in any of the guide\
  \ books I\u2019d spent months poring over.\n\nInstead of swarthy ticos (Costa Ricans),\
  \ I had a peculiar, middle-aged Welshman for company. Instead of surfing and sunbathing,\
  \ I was put to work porch sweeping and pot scrubbing. I spent the nights scouring\
  \ the beaches for turtle eggs and the days manning the hatchery, eagerly watching\
  \ the nests for any sign of movement. My avuncular host regaled me with tales of\
  \ his spontaneous emigration to Costa Rica, fending off illegal egg poachers and\
  \ surviving multiple snake bites to build his sanctuary.\n\nBy the time I left to\
  \ continue my travels (severely sunburnt with a stomach parasite that would require\
  \ a two-week course of antibiotics), I thought it ironic that an eccentric Welshman\
  \ had taught me more about pura vida than any tico ever could."
