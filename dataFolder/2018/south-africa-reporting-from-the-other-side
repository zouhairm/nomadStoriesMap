Text: "Next stop, Buccaneers Lodge in Cintsa. Another Paradise, beers and you know\
  \ what. Long beaches, hot sun and not so cold water. I sip a cold Castle, the joint\
  \ finished off. My fellow-travellers Tobias (a good German), Floor (tall and Dutch)\
  \ and the Manno sisters (Americans : awesome, amazing, cute) are gone. I\u2019m\
  \ in my own little world. \u201CIf there is a party, then we can go!\u201D I hear\
  \ Tobias say. Tobias also tells me: \u201CIt\u2019s amazing, Peter, you are so much\
  \ older than all of us. But you\u2019re doing a great job.\u201D Smiles. The desire\
  \ to party is what brings mankind together. I have stopped observing, I just blend\
  \ in, with deeper peace within. The medication is working. In Cintsa, life is good\
  \ and the sun is bright. The mosquitos bite and the bar plays plastic music for\
  \ too many Germans, but a few good men. Old scars heal endlessly slow, sweet sounds\
  \ of waves crashing.\n\nOctober 8th. The BazBus brings me back together with Tobias,\
  \ Floor, Alex and Teddi in African Ubuntu Lodge in Jeffrey\u2019s Bay. Fine food\
  \ and late nights, another surf lesson and the next day I\u2019m off to Wild Spirit\
  \ in The Crags, Nature\u2019s Valley. A magical place to chill in the middle of\
  \ nature, surrounded by trees and babboons and little Bongi and hippie girls and\
  \ youknowwhat. Just \u201Cbeing\u201D in such a deep way that I stay stuck here\
  \ for 5 days. A couple of South-Africans pass by, Dan and Dieter, we have a bonfire\
  \ on the beach and I fall on my face again (Vodka). Next day I\u2019m grumpy\u2026\
  \ The happy people just shrug and smile. \u201CHe\u2019s had too much to drink yesterday.\u201D\
  \ Reading Etienne Kruger\u2019s \u201CGetting lucky\u201D, hearing a piece of conversation\u2026\
  \ Go with the flow. The Congregation of Peters in Wild Spirit ends: we had 4 Peters\
  \ in 4 square meters. One Belgian, one Canadian, one South-African and Grandpa,\
  \ sitting in his comfy chair all day. It\u2019s like running into myself at different\
  \ ages, wonderfully weird.\n\nOctober 15th. I finally get off the BazBus and hitch\
  \ a ride with Christian and Alex, a Congolese guy and his girlfriend, telling stories\
  \ about l\u2019autre Afrique. Wilderness and Knysna, I could live here. People speaking\
  \ a mixture of Afrikaans, English, and local dialect. I take a canoo trip to the\
  \ waterfall in Wilderness. Nature\u2019s beauty. I decide to rent a car in George\
  \ and drive it to Capetown in three days. Within one hour the rental car is damaged.\
  \ I drive through the Karoo, in a loop around Swartberg Pass, through Calitzdorp\
  \ and Barrydale. Beautiful mountains and dusty roads."
