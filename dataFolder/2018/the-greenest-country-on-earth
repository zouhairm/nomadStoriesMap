Text: "You\u2019ve probably heard about Costa Rica: the cloud-ringed mountains, the\
  \ expansive beaches, the all around good vibes. Maybe you\u2019ve also heard it\
  \ called the greenest country on earth.\nCristina and I heard that too, and since\
  \ we wanted to learn more about sustainability, organic farming and food justice,\
  \ we packed our bags for 2 weeks working on an organic farm called El Tablazo.\n\
  \n Just after arriving in San Jos\xE9, we noticed some curious graffiti: No a la\
  \ expansi\xF3n pi\xF1era\n    Looking at each other, wondering if we understand\
  \ correctly, I translated out loud, in the form of a confused question: \u201CNo\
  \ to the pineapple expansion?\u201D Sounded weird.\n    Then another: La agua es\
  \ vida, no mercanc\xEDa\n    I wondered aloud, the connection vaguely dawning on\
  \ me, \u201CWater is life, not merchandise?\u201D \n\n    Gabriel and Mima, two\
  \ inspired environmentalists who started the farm, welcomed us into their lives.\
  \ We farmed, cooked, lived together, shared stories and cultures. The peaceful routine,\
  \ waking at dawn, feeding the animals, watering and harvesting the vegetables, we\
  \ fell in love. Their lifestyle inspired us. But we soon learned that not everyone\
  \ in Costa Rica is quite so progressive.  \nThey told us about Costa Rica\u2019\
  s terrible pesticide use and all the commercial farming. They described recent protests\
  \ in San Jos\xE9 against pineapple overproduction and the privatization of water\
  \ sources. The graffiti! I thought.\nEven up in the mountains, we met this harsh\
  \ reality. You see, Gabriel and Mima had a new neighbor. A wealthy man bought the\
  \ land and, to Gabriel and Mima\u2019s horror, had the plot deforested, removing\
  \ many plant species. \n\n    \u201CThe man is a child,\u201D Gabriel told us. \u201C\
  He doesn\u2019t understand what he is doing to the earth. That soil won\u2019t recover\
  \ for 100 years.\u201D \n    They tried everything, reasoning with him, reporting\
  \ every law he broke, even offering to buy the land from him for the price he bought\
  \ it for. But he refused to sell unless was for a profit.\n    \u201CI am applying\
  \ for a grant for female entrepreneurs,\u201D Mima explained, \u201CWith the money\
  \ we can buy it from him.\u201D\n    \u201CWe don\u2019t care about paying the money.\u201D\
  \ Gabriel added. \u201CWhen we die, the loan dies. What matters is the land.\u201D\
  \n\n    We had a lot to reflect on, resting that last night at Gabriel\u2019s parents\u2019\
  \ house, in the city. To give us more to chew on, Gabriel\u2019s mother brought\
  \ a big pineapple to share.  Too big.  Suspiciously big. \n    Gabriel looked at\
  \ her with disappointment, and said, \"\xBFQu\xE9 pasa? No a la expansi\xF3n pi\xF1\
  era.\u201D"
