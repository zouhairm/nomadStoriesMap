Text: "When you arrive in Africa, you can see it shining. The rooftops made of sheet\
  \ metal sparkle under the weight of the sun. After a stop in Zanzibar, the airplane\
  \ full of tourists gets almost completely empty, we remain11. The boarding crew\
  \ asks me to confirm that I\u2019m going to Dar Es Salaam. Another departure, another\
  \ fast landing. MamaNovetha and father Paolo are waiting for me at the airport with\
  \ a card with my name on. Suddenly I\u2019m in the place I've always dreamt to be,\
  \ driving in a yellow jeep towards the red sand that I've always dreamt to have.\
  \ Like a perfect occidental, I feel as Nicole Kidman in Australia, with my green\
  \ jacket and an arm hanging out of the window, on the road to Pomerini, a rural\
  \ village 10hours away. It\u2019s already nighttime when we arrive. Late arrivals\
  \ are always the worst since everything seems novel and distorted. It's the same\
  \ this time, too. Someone shows me the house in a rush, it's quite dark inside:\
  \ the bathroom, the showers, the kitchen. I don\u2019t brush my teeth neither I\
  \ have a pee, mainly because I\u2019m scared of getting something wrong, but also\
  \ because I\u2019m just scared in general. I close the door of what would have been\
  \ my room for the next 6months and surprisingly I don\u2019t cry.\nIn the morning\
  \ everything appears in another light. I had a pee I hadn't the night before. Even\
  \ my room appears in a friendly light that reassures me. The stillness is present;\
  \ some chickens are running around the yard where MamaNovetha works with the clay.\
  \ Finally, the sun is high in the sky. The rain has the power of making the soul\
  \ feel grey, just like it does for any landscape in any part of the world you are.\
  \ Some things don\u2019t change, and this is one of them. During the days before\
  \ I left from Italy, I refused to look up any info about places or food. My curiosity\
  \ has always driven me and it's the same partner with which I arrived here. Now\
  \ I\u2019m in Africa for my first intercontinental journey. The landscape around\
  \ me alternates from the red land saturated with iron into, to the cornfields that\
  \ have not yet ripened. I don\u2019t know what I'll find here; the pace is slow\
  \ and it'll be difficult to get used to. Having freetime to think brings me home,\
  \ to what I left without thinking twice. During my first nights in Pomerini I asked\
  \ myself if I took the right decision coming here. But then, I return to myself\
  \ and to my state of \"InOmniaParatus\u201D. Now I know it. It isn't a journey like\
  \ any other, it's an experience I can\u2019t wait to have. And I\u2019m ready to\
  \ start."
