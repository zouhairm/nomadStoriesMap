Text: "In summer 2016, my plans to study abroad in Ecuador came to a halt after a\
  \ severe earthquake devastated the country. Forced to find an alternative course,\
  \ I settled on a \u201Cstudy abroad\u201D trip at the Bad River Ojibwe Reservation...\
  \ in northern Wisconsin. Leading up to the trip, I couldn\u2019t help but wonder,\
  \ how much could I possibly learn in a week? And only five hours north? I wish I\
  \ could go back and drown out my cynicism. \n\nBy some fluke of nature, my alternate\
  \ course was almost cancelled after the reservation was hit by severe thunderstorms\
  \ a month before the trip. Extreme flooding destroyed houses and washed out several\
  \ major roads, leaving parts of the reservation without power for weeks. My trip\
  \ landed in the midst of the community\u2019s recovery. \n\nArriving at the reservation,\
  \ the first thing you noticed was that everything was wet. The ground felt spongey\
  \ and the air was moist and thick in your lungs. Despite the feeling we were walking\
  \ into something terrible, my peers and I were greeted by smiles and hugs from tribe\
  \ members. It struck me as odd how happy they seemed and how eager they were to\
  \ show us around their reservation, given how extensive the storm damage was. Nonetheless,\
  \ we spent the week exploring everywhere from the pow-wow grounds and the wild rice\
  \ sloughs to the health clinic and tribal elders\u2019 homes.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t\
  \ until we saw the muddy wild rice sloughs that I began to understand the flood\
  \ from the Native\u2019s perspective. Wild rice holds great significance to the\
  \ community, not just for its economic value but its spiritual roots, and the flood\
  \ water had risen so high that the rice grains were washed loose and the majority\
  \ of the season\u2019s crop was ruined. Yet, it seemed to me the tribe was not angered\
  \ enough and I felt sorry for the community. However, while canoeing the sloughs,\
  \ a tribal elder explained to us that they believed the flood was a cleansing of\
  \ the land; for whatever reason, their land was being prepared for something more\
  \ important. I soon came to realize that despite the disaster, the tribe did not\
  \ feel sorry for themselves and it was not my place to label them as victims. I\
  \ just needed to listen. \n\nIn my short time with the Bad River Ojibwe, I discovered\
  \ the what it means to live purposefully, and ultimately I came to recognize the\
  \ power of perspective. For teaching me about their culture and inspiring me to\
  \ live more graciously, I will always be thankful to the Bad River community. Miigwetch\
  \ (\u201Cthank you\u201D in Ojiwemowen)!"
