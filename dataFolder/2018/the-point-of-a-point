Text: "Down the sweeping arm of Mornington Peninsula perches Point Nepean, a natural\
  \ wonder. Once used as a military base, the \u2018Point\u2019 has now been converted\
  \ into an extensive National Park.\n\nMuch beloved by locals and a hotspot for tourists,\
  \ it is a place to buff up your history (or take the perfect instagram). Though\
  \ my original purpose was to dutifully check it off the guidebook list, I immensely\
  \ enjoyed the experience.\n\nImagine you are a soldier in 1918 at Fort Nepean, this\
  \ spit of land between 2 raging oceans. Bitingly cold and damp in winter, bastardly\
  \ hot in the summer- it sounds right miserable. \n\nCase in point, blokes kept their\
  \ spirits up by joking about how many stairs they had to walk up from the harbor\
  \ according to signs: 117-175 depending on morale. The actual count is 115, though\
  \ I\u2019ll say a few have been lost during restoration.\_\n\nFurther down the Point\
  \ is Chevriot Beach. 50 years ago, Prime Minister Harold Holt vacationed at the\
  \ secluded shore. He went for a swim and was never seen again.\n\nThis tragic story\
  \ leads to a number of puzzling questions. Mainly, Chevriot Beach is infamously\
  \ known for the Rip, 2 miles of water streaking out into the bay. Signs repeatedly\
  \ warn of rough surf and huge, unexpected waves. Not to mention all the terrible\
  \ beasties that lurk underwater as per usual. So why did the Prime Minister go swimming?\
  \ And none of his friends swam with him? The only logical explanation came from\
  \ the bus driver- it was a planned sub operation.\n\nDespite its colorful history,\
  \ my day at Point Nepean seemed uneventful. With pleasant sea breezes and no unexploded\
  \ bombs (real danger according to signs), I enjoyed learning pieces of Australia's\_\
  history through the microcosm of this land.\n\nAt sunset, I walked to the pier on\
  \ a whim. The ocean was clear with a white sandy bottom, blemished only by spots\
  \ of kelp.\_\n\nStrolling along, imagine the unimaginable. The appearance of Hugh\
  \ Jackman, the terribly\_handsome\_Aussie actor, or a sighting of a leaping unicorn\
  \ whale (rather narwhal) but no, it was even more amazing.\_\n\nUnexpectedly, the\
  \ kelp mass\_moved. It was actually an enormous stingray. 10 feet across, I\u2019\
  m exaggerating but only by a couple of inches. It was majestic, beautiful, awe-inspiring.\
  \ Words can\u2019t describe it, but I might stay in Australia because I have fallen\
  \ for my true soulmate.\n\nSometimes the best parts are saved for last, and the\
  \ experiences of Point Nepean aren\u2019t just in the guidebook, but surprises discovered\
  \ by simply being there."
