Text: "I am a dawdling, stumbling child when it comes to lights and colorful decoration;\
  \ standing there, mouth agape. Hold my hand and lead me anywhere with pretty things\
  \ and I will give myself to you with no resistance- yours to drag around like a\
  \ kid with a helium balloon tied to its wrist. Edging past the barriers and entering\
  \ the Brazilian truffle box that was Feira De Sao Christovao was no exception- I\
  \ tripped over my flip-flop and accidentally kicked a dog who glared at me with\
  \ the same sass as the local women on the beaches with the toned bums and the good\
  \ hair. After my friend managed to clamber me into an Uber at ten at night to visit\
  \ what she could only describe as a \u2018large karaoke stadium\u2019, my expectations\
  \ were unpromisingly low. I will never tire of the throat-thickening heat that dances\
  \ along the pavements during a sticky Rio night time, nor will the glow of a matchbox\
  \ Christ the Redeemer burn out in monotony. However, this particular night all I\
  \ wanted to do was to say \u2018boa noite\u2019 and hit the sack. So as we pulled\
  \ up outside what could easily be a setting for an urban computer game, I let out\
  \ a deep sigh and shuffled closer to the blackened walls of the derelict arena that\
  \ stood before me. \L\LAfter handing over a few crumpled notes we followed a group\
  \ of teenagers through the entrance gates. If there was ever a time in my life that\
  \ I regret judging something by its cover, this was most definitely it. Tucked out\
  \ of the way of Rio\u2019s city centre and inside this big lump of concrete was\
  \ an emporium of delicious Brazilian culture. I was the blondest, tallest \u2018\
  Gringo\u2019 in sight; a combination of my wide eyes and obvious eagerness eradicated\
  \ my plan of trying to \u2018blend in\u2019 amongst the locals. Completely engulfed\
  \ by exotic wares on both sides, I struggled to take everything in and before I\
  \ could, my friend had tugged me down a narrow side alley between a stall of handmade\
  \ ash trays and Queijo Coalho (halloumi-like cheese). I was just about to protest\
  \ before I was stopped short by the living room sized corner we had found ourselves\
  \ in. Filling up half the space was a tiny stage topped with four men jamming on\
  \ dirty instruments- their melody filling in the gaps between the people who danced\
  \ to it like slippery fish twisting in unison. This style of music and dancing,\
  \ this \u2018Forro\u2019 as they call it, was everything my awkward, English, uptight\
  \ limbs wanted to surrender to; a satisfying accumulation of every school-girl fantasy\
  \ I had about the City Of God."
