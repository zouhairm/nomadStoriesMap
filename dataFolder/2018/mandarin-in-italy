Text: "It was cold and approaching midnight as I paced back and forth on the street\
  \ of Via Nizza. I was looking for the number 34, but I couldn\u2019t find it. I\
  \ looked around, to see if perhaps a friendly face could help me find my hostel.\
  \ It seemed though, that here in Turin, much like other cities around the world,\
  \ the night brings out an assortment of people not noticed as often during the day.\
  \ A group of men who reeked of alcohol loitered nearby, staring openly at me in\
  \ a way that certainly didn\u2019t inspire trust. Two other men were arguing animatedly;\
  \ a fight looked imminent. I saw no women either, and I began to feel uneasy. Inwardly,\
  \ I started to question my stubborn desire to travel alone. You will find yourself\
  \ in sticky situations, I had told myself, and it\u2019s important that you figure\
  \ out how to solve them yourself. \n An Asian man carrying a plastic shopping bag\
  \ walked past me. He looked at me and he walked on. I moved aimlessly again from\
  \ one end of the street to the other, peering into windows I knew didn\u2019t belong\
  \ to my hostel, as I considered my options. I wasn\u2019t in the direst of situations,\
  \ but I wasn\u2019t in the best either. I didn\u2019t speak Italian, and the hostel\
  \ manager didn\u2019t speak English. Check-in had officially closed and I was late\
  \ due to a delayed flight. If I called her, I wouldn\u2019t be able to talk to her.\
  \  \n The Asian man came back to me, a look of concern on his face.\n \u201CAre\
  \ you lost?\u201D he asked me in Mandarin.\n At that moment, I felt immense gratitude\
  \ for the Mandarin my parents had imposed upon me in the familial home. I may be\
  \ Australian, but as a child of immigrants, when abroad people rarely guess my nationality\
  \ correctly. \n In my imperfect Mandarin, I explained to him that I was unable to\
  \ find my hostel and unable to speak Italian. He however, could, and he proceeded\
  \ to call my hostel for me, speaking rapidly in fluent Italian. He directed me to\
  \ a unmarked maroon door which the host had unlocked remotely.\n \u201CThird level,\u201D\
  \ he said, his kind eyes wishing me well. \u201CYou shouldn\u2019t stay here, it's\
  \ not safe.\" Due to the flurry of activity, I had thought that a hostel near the\
  \ main train station would be a safe bet. An Italian local later also told me that\
  \ this area was dangerous in the evening.\n I thanked the man profusely and bade\
  \ him goodbye. \u201CTake care,\u201D he said. As I climbed the stairs, I thought\
  \ how ironic it was that I hadn\u2019t spoken Mandarin in months, only to find myself\
  \ doing so in Italy, of all places, at a time that I needed it most."
