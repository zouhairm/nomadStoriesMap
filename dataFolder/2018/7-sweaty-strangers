Text: "\u201CAre you sure there\u2019s room?\u201D I ask as he signals us into his\
  \ 1985 Hilux. The prospect of all 7 of us fitting into his 5 seater car is unlikely,\
  \ but it\u2019s hard to disagree with the confidence of his grinning moustache.\
  \ The vinyl sticks to my leg as I lean against the window, trying not to invade\
  \ the space of the man beside me. He can\u2019t speak any English but shows me a\
  \ photo of a baby, as if to assure me he\u2019s a family man. In the front is the\
  \ driver Samoura, \u201Cmy nephew Joseph lives in Melbourne, maybe you know him?\u201D\
  \ he suggests. I tell him I\u2019m from Sydney, but he zooms in on a Facebook photo\
  \ just in case. The young boy beside him doesn\u2019t say much, but offers me a\
  \ piece of gum. Samoura sees the exchange, \u201Chabibi\u201D he teases. The car\
  \ laugh and blushing the boy sinks back in his seat. \n\nPulling out of the pick\
  \ up bay we are cut off. Samoura sticks his head out the window ready to argue,\
  \ but soon realises he recognises the driver. \u201CI grew up with his brother\u201D\
  , he laughs. He pulls out the car again, this time with more success and seven sweaty\
  \ strangers share window breeze down a Lebanese highway.\n\nSamoura has a 5 star\
  \ rating and after reading about the Lebanese public transport system, I thought\
  \ I\u2019d try my luck at \xFCber. \u201CWelcome to the jewel of the Middle East,\u201D\
  \ he proclaims as if he\u2019s rehearsed the line a thousand times. In the distance\
  \ I can see the outline of mountains, and the glare of the midday sun crowns their\
  \ peaks. \u201CThat\u2019s the Garden of Eden,\u201D Samoura jokes. We pass a faded\
  \ turquoise building etched with what look like bullet holes. Beside it a similarly\
  \ striking tower, stained with age. Side by side are a mosque and a church. \u201C\
  If only we could remember both our buildings point up to heaven and out to the same\
  \ city,\u201D he sighs. The textures of Beirut tell of the country\u2019s struggle\
  \ to rebuild itself after the civil war. The once bustling metropolis is now an\
  \ echo of magnificence.\n\n\u201CWe stop for Nescaf\xE9,\u201D Samoura declares.\
  \  He wants me to try Knafeh - his favourite sweet cheese coated in rose syrup and\
  \ pistachio. He refuses to let me pay, insisting that I\u2019m a guest in his country.\
  \ And a little heavier, we drive on. He turns up the radio and the car sings along\
  \ - like the road trips I know back home. The radio is a souvenir, a testament of\
  \ shared human experience. But the chorus is cut off by a broadcast of the Zuhr-\
  \ the call to prayer. And by the same souvenir I am reminded that we are seven sweaty\
  \ strangers sharing window breeze down a Lebanese highway."
