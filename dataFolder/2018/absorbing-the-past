Text: "I used to smile the moment I felt it. \n\n\u201CWant to learn how to use it\
  \ yourself?\u201D I remember my great-aunt Ireni offering, as she placed the sponge\
  \ on a nearby volcanic rock. Symi, a tiny Greek island in the Aegean sea, is filled\
  \ with geographical rarities. \n\n\u201COkay,\u201D my voice chirped. As a child,\
  \ the pale-gold sponges intrigued me. They were different from the ones I was used\
  \ to washing with\u2014these were sea sponges from deep within Symi\u2019s cerulean\
  \ waves. \n\nMy young eyes relished at the sight: Ireni took the sponge from my\
  \ hands and squeezed it like a lemon over her body. She stroked the lush substance\
  \ up and down her tanned flesh, gently. I wanted my skin to be just as radiant in\
  \ the blazing Greek sun as hers. \n\n\u201CWith these sponges, your skin will be\
  \ as soft as the foam on the sea, my koukla!\u201D she used to exclaim. \n\nSymi\
  \ was once known throughout the Ottoman Empire as the premier place to purchase\
  \ the most sought-after sponges. Merchants and skin-lovers alike were in constant\
  \ awe of the plethora of these miraculous sea gifts. By the mid 19th century, the\
  \ island was basking in its reputation as a hub for these unique treasures. Far\
  \ and wide, its reputation spread, along with its wealth.\n\nI soon discover these\
  \ sponges are filled with far more stories than holes. \n\n\u201CIt was an odyssey\u2026\
  \u201D Ireni\u2019s voice trails off into the sea.  Her enthusiasm is replaced with\
  \ sorrow as she recalls the stories of the deep sea divers who risked\u2014and often\
  \ lost\u2014their lives retrieving these prized-possessions from unimaginable depths.\
  \ She chronicles the lives of our family\u2019s male ancestors, who began their\
  \ training at a young age. The lack of knowledge on the perils of diving sickness,\
  \ coupled with the pressure to dive deeper into the ocean, created an extremely\
  \ dangerous pursuit. \n\nI learn of the loss of life my ancestors suffered at the\
  \ hands of this \u201Ctyrannical\u201D trade, but also the profound wealth its survivors\
  \ enjoyed. \n\n\u201CThey made a sacrifice,\u201D Ireni concludes, with a heavy\
  \ sigh. \n\nWe watch hundreds of tourists stroll along the sidewalks of the colourful\
  \ neoclassical buildings. Present-day sea sponges are found in the local shops\u2014\
  a relic of the past, now the perfect gift for any skin-savvy tourist. A tender boy\
  \ picks up a sponge, thrusts it in the water and giggles. \n\nAs I hold one in the\
  \ palm of my hand, I can feel its complicated history hidden within its crevices.\
  \ Floating in the water, I breathe deeply as I squeeze it all in, and then quietly\
  \ let it all out."
