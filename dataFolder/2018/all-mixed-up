Text: "\"You're only alone when you want to be\". It's a statement uttered constantly\
  \ by solo travelers across the backpacker circuit of Southeast Asia. It's so common,\
  \ it should officially be inscribed in the Thailand passport stamp. But those five\
  \ months in Asia were behind me. Being alone now wasn't an option, just a reality.\
  \ \n\nI try to decipher the smell in the air; fermented cabbage or urine? A man\
  \ who seems to have forgotten his shirt staggers towards me, his movements perfectly\
  \ in sync with the train, reminiscent of a dancer in a Beyonce video. \n\n\"You\
  \ smoking?\"\n\nNot sure if he's asking if I'm on fire, I nervously answer \"yes?\"\
  .\n\nHe lights a cigarette, and puffs it like an athlete chugs a Gatorade after\
  \ a winning play. I follow suit, gesturing to the \"No Smoking\" symbol on the wall.\
  \ The mood lightens when the man assures me \"In Romania, I make rules\" as he spits\
  \ on the floor with disgust towards authority. \n\nThis man is clearly drunk, but\
  \ it makes his attempt at English more confident. We chat; he invites me to meet\
  \ his family. Hopefully they own shirts.\n\nI follow him through the train.  He\
  \ moves drunkenly yet gracefully, like a whiskey soaked ballerina. His booze-laden\
  \ breath and smoke puffs lead me to his raucous, barrel-chested family.\n\nFirst\
  \ order of business; introducing me as his new friend from the States. Second order\
  \ of business; deciding on a common language. After much confusion and a lot of\
  \ gesturing we agree on a mash up of German, English and Spanish. Each sentence\
  \ includes words from each language... Spermlish?\n\nTo christen this newfound friendship,\
  \ a bottle of Romanian moonshine (Palinka) is passed around, again, and again. As\
  \ no day of drinking is complete without drunk dialing, several family members pull\
  \ out their phones. One sloppy call is surprisingly more lucrative than my booty\
  \ calls of yesteryear. I'm handed the phone, say \"Da\" a few times, and hang up.\
  \  I am told I had just accepted a job as a concrete mixer. I start Monday.\n\n\
  The blackout express eventually finds its way to our final destination. We exit\
  \ the train, and turn the closest newsstand into our own personal pub. Drinks are\
  \ raised, Spermlish is spoken, and laughs are had. We are a motley crew, but probably\
  \ not the worst this station has ever seen. Our evening ends with my new band of\
  \ brothers screaming goodbyes and banging on the taxi as it takes me away. As the\
  \ saying goes, \"you're only alone if you want to be\"... or if you're waiting for\
  \ me to come mix concrete."
