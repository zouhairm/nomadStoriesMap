Text: "\"Can we sit with you?\" \n\nThere stood a group of young men, completely drenched\
  \ from head to toe with water. As a precautious woman in a country still foreign\
  \ to me, I was hesitant, but they began pulling up chairs before we could answer.\
  \ Ringing out their shirts and shaking water droplets from their dewy black hair,\
  \ they ordered a round of Myanmar beers. \"Would you like one?\" one man asked.\
  \ This was Henry, not only an inspiring person but someone I never expected to meet\
  \ in Mandalay, Myanmar. \n\nIn April, Myanmar hosts a countrywide New Year\u2019\
  s celebration called Thingyan, or water festival. For five days, schools and shops\
  \ shut their doors and people take to the streets for the most magnificent water\
  \ fight I\u2019ve ever seen. Meant to cleanse yourself of sins from the previous\
  \ year, children and adults alike grab buckets and water guns to soak anyone who\
  \ crosses their path.\n\nThe Mandalay air, normally thick with motorbike exhaust,\
  \ was instead filled with booming music as adrenalized people piled into the typically\
  \ barren streets. Upon exiting our hotel, we were bombarded by locals eagerly taking\
  \ our hands and guiding us into cascades of pounding water. We wandered by endless\
  \ stages, each one featuring a different apparatus\u2013from cannons to balloon\
  \ launchers\u2013to douse us with water. When it felt as though our bodies absorbed\
  \ so much water that it coursed fervently through our veins, we stopped at a restaurant\
  \ for a bowl of noodles. \n\nAnd there was Henry.\n\nHim and his friends squeezed\
  \ into our table and we laughed at how soaked we were while sharing unique Myanmar\
  \ dishes. Inquiring how the men knew each other, Henry enthusiastically answered,\
  \ \u201CWe\u2019re all gay!\u201D In a predominately Buddhist country where public\
  \ affection between a heterosexual couple was often taboo, I was pleasantly taken\
  \ aback to meet a whole group of openly gay Myanmar men. To my surprise, they shared\
  \ how they didn\u2019t experience much prejudice in their country and we discussed\
  \ how it compared to acceptance in America. \n\nIn this moment, surrounded by unapologetically\
  \ open and welcoming strangers, I realized it was not Myanmar\u2019s views that\
  \ needed loosening, but my own. \n\nWe exchanged contact information and the men\
  \ invited us to join their pride parade that afternoon. Overwhelmed by their generosity,\
  \ we happily agreed. As we walked into the crowd, surrounded by a sea of locals\
  \ with no foreigners nor towels in sight, I had never felt more connected and warmly\
  \ embraced by a place I had just come to know."
