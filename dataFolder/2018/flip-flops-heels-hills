Text: "Note to self: Flip-flops bad choice for hike.\n\nEspecially in Hampi, whose\
  \ landscape is a toss-up between smooth misshapen boulders and intricately-carved\
  \ 500-year-old ruins. A trait that makes it attractive to sensibly-heeled enthusiasts\
  \ of bouldering, archaeology, and heritage.\n\nWe are enthusiastic. Not sensibly-heeled.\
  \ A dubious combination on the bald rocks of Matanga Hill. The steps cut into the\
  \ rock ended a long way back. We crawl on scraped hands and knees, teetering on\
  \ the edge of a sheer drop. \n\nThese boulders started life 2.5 billion years ago\
  \ as one gigantic granite monolith. The forces of nature may have since worn them\
  \ down to free-standing pieces, but these boulders have never been moved, not even\
  \ by Earth\u2019s plates. You know, those shifting plates that birth mountains and\
  \ seas. Yeah, these rocks don\u2019t care.\n\nWe ready ourselves to inch forward,\
  \ to hug Matanga Hill and battle vertigo. If we make it to the top, we will see\
  \ all of ancient Hampi. Virupaksha Temple and Bazaar Street doused in monsoon green.\
  \ The Tungabhadra River slicing immovable rock debris. The sunset view is to die\
  \ for, allegedly.\n\nThe landscape stretches away from us. A herd of nimble goats\
  \ hops from rock to ruin. Fearsome monsoon clouds obliterate the distant horizon.\
  \ The view, equal parts terrifying and awe-inspiring, flashes before our eyes.\n\
  \nVoices. And a rhythmic tic-tic. Two local teenage girls round the corner coming\
  \ down. Dressed in their evening best, frilly satin salwar kameezes in bold, clashing\
  \ colours. Midnight blacks, ember reds, peacock blues, golden beiges. Hair neatly\
  \ oiled and plaited, sporting a flashy clip of imitation stones that explode in\
  \ the flaring sun. On their feet, the only muted accessory, brown faux-leather heels.\
  \ Two inches, sharpened to a point, taming the granite.\n\nThe girls giggle and\
  \ chatter down the smooth rock face, as sure-footed as on an evening jaunt to the\
  \ town market. They pick apart boys and text messages, and melt over their current\
  \ movie-star crush. Their multi-hued glass bangles chime in. Their unlived lives\
  \ stream in front of their eyes, all its glorious possibilities unlocked by their\
  \ words and magnified by the movies. The one true love they will find. The big cities\
  \ they will travel to and live in. College life. Independent life. The future.\n\
  \nThey barely notice us or the view, both symbols of a past they are straining to\
  \ grow out of. They disappear from sight and their voices fade to wind.\n\nNote\
  \ to self: Heels on hills. Must try."
