Text: "Republic of Yemen:  The Unknown Arabia\n\nThe plane was dark and quiet...my\
  \ eyes shut and my head leaning forward; next thing I recalled was the decent into\
  \ a country I could only imagine:  Yemen...hum, Yemen?  It is the poorest country\
  \ in the world. I had read about it - what was I getting into?\n\nI was greeted\
  \ by my escort with the traditional Yemenite style of clothing. A futa (a wrap-around\
  \ male skirt) with a turban and a long, frightening knife at his waist.  He did\
  \ not speak and my fear mounted.  I was taken to an \"apartment.\"  Yemenite style.\
  \  \n\nEntering the apartment, I gasped at what I was seeing.  I immediately stepped\
  \ on a roach and quickly stood on a chair. Momentarily, I closed all rooms except\
  \ the bedroom and the bathroom.  I was told that this was one of the \"best\" apartments\
  \ in Yemen. Perusing my bedroom, I noticed large holes in the wall.  Frightening\
  \ I saw a goat through one of the holes, waved and left. Living in Yemen.\n\nSana'a\
  \ (the capital of Yemen) is busy; at times frantic.  It suffers from traffic jams\
  \ and lack of planning.  But it is lively and diverse. The architecture is stunning.\
  \  It has been realized that architecture in Yemen is of the highest standards.\
  \ \n\nI met an acquaintance, Ahmed (a tall gentleman with a wonderful smile beneath\
  \ his turban).  He asked me if I wanted to go \"camel jumping.\"  What on earth\
  \ is camel jumping?  Come.  You must experience this. We drove to the west coast\
  \ in a desert plain.  Camel jumpers are famous throughout Yemen for their speed,\
  \ strength and courage. Taking running starts, jumpers try to sail over as many\
  \ camels as possible. It sounded extremely frightening and I begged him not to take\
  \ me. You would actually miss this?  It's a once in a lifetime!  He grabbed my arm\
  \ and off we went.  We arrived; me shaking in my boots. You've got to be insane\
  \ to do this.  Ahmed said, \"I'll go first and then you.\"  Great.  I watched him\
  \ and he began a long running start, jumped, and easily missed the two camels. \
  \ Now it was my turn.  Shaking like a leaf, I begged for a successful jump. Finally,\
  \ I began to run with all my might and tried to leap over the camels.  My right\
  \ fool kicked the first camel and I tumbled over the second camel, lying on the\
  \ ground face up.  End of story: They discovered I had a concussion.  So much for\
  \ camel jumping.  Stupid.\n\nYemen is a curious country.  It offers an immense amount\
  \ of variety, diversity and options.  Would I visit again?  Yes, absolutely!  You\
  \ haven't lived until you explore Yemen."
