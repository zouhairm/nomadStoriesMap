Text: "\u201CMama said Dede\u2019s fishing for squid, so we\u2019re having fried squid\
  \ for dinner,\u201D I tell Bradley. \u201CI\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s what\
  \ she\u2019s said, anyway.\u201D\n\nMama confirms my translation with a resounding\
  \ \u201CYa!\u201D and we both laugh.\n\n\u201CHow are you doing that?\u201D Bradley\
  \ asks me. I shrug. I can\u2019t explain how we can suddenly understand one another.\
  \ Mama doesn\u2019t speak a word of English and I don\u2019t speak a word of Bahasa\
  \ Indonesia.\n\nWe\u2019ve been in this remote fishing village in Java for 3 months,\
  \ living in a bedroom in Mama\u2019s four-room house in front of a point break.\
  \ We spend every morning surfing until we can\u2019t lift our arms, and every afternoon\
  \ listening to Mama chatter away in Indonesian as she chops vegetables. Maybe she\
  \ tells us about her life, how her day is going, what she\u2019s cooking. Maybe\
  \ she tells us her real name. Surely it can\u2019t be Mama, but that\u2019s how\
  \ her son-in-law introduced her and we\u2019re not sure what else to call her. We\
  \ listen and nod. We laugh when she laughs.\n\nWe tell her about our lives at home,\
  \ how much we miss our dogs and coffee without an inch of grounds at the bottom.\
  \ We tell her how amazing or terrible the surf is, and how we burned our feet running\
  \ across the black sand beach at noon. We pat our bellies and say \u201CMmmmm\u201D\
  \ so she knows breakfast is delicious. She listens and nods. She laughs when we\
  \ laugh.\n\nI wonder if she thinks it\u2019s silly, the way we have one-sided conversations,\
  \ talking at one another in gibberish. Today, however, is different because our\
  \ chatter is no longer noise. We\u2019re not just communicating, we\u2019re bantering.\
  \ We\u2019re completing one another\u2019s sentences in two different languages.\
  \ We spend the next week, our last days in Java, talking to each other, not simply\
  \ at each other. We listen and nod. We laugh, but now we laugh together.\n\nOn our\
  \ final morning, we sit in the kitchen, listening to the rain beat on the metal\
  \ roof. I gingerly sip the last of my coffee, careful not to tip my cup too far\
  \ so I won\u2019t get a mouthful of grounds. I\u2019m not ready to go.\n\nI could\
  \ stay here forever, I think. Here in our tiny room with its dingy bathroom that\
  \ doesn\u2019t have a sink. Drinking coffee grounds and surfing every morning. I\
  \ could stay here with this mama who isn\u2019t mine but somehow feels like she\
  \ is. I could\u2026but I can\u2019t. \n\nOur taxi pulls up and we load our backpacks\
  \ into the trunk. Mama squeezes my shoulder, her eyes full of tears. We stand in\
  \ the rain, hugging goodbye, not saying a word in English or Indonesian."
