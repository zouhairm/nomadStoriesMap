Text: "I travelled to Malaysia in May, 2017 with my best friend. We flew to Kuala\
  \ Lumpur from Delhi, India and stayed a day there. On the 3rd day of our trip we\
  \ flew to Langkawi. From the airport there we booked an Uber to our beach resort\
  \ hotel at the Pantai Cenang, Langkawi. The uber driver named \u2018Muhammed  Azif\u2019\
  \ came to escort us. He was courteous and friendly. We reached our hotel and we\
  \ disembarked from the car with our luggage. We approached the front desk, we were\
  \ asked to complete the formalities and our rooms were to be ready in 20 minutes.\
  \ We submitted our luggage at the hotel cloak room facility and we decided to take\
  \ a short walk around the hotel. At this moment I realized I do not have my phone\
  \ with me, neither in my jeans pocket nor in my sling bag. In a state of panic we\
  \ ran to the hotel to check the hotel lobby and my luggage, maybe I mistakenly left\
  \ it there.  I owned an Apple iPhone 6 which was newly purchased before my Malaysia\
  \ trip with my that month\u2019s teacher\u2019s salary. I could not find my phone\
  \ in the hotel lobby or the seating area. My friend suggested I call my phone from\
  \ her phone, which I did. To great relief I could connect to my number and could\
  \ hear a ring. But no one was picking it up from the other end. My friend tried\
  \ my number again, this time a guy picked up. On asking who he was, he answered\
  \ he was Muhammed and that this phone has been left on the back seat of his car.\
  \ We told him we are the same passengers who took a ride in his car an hour back.\
  \ He could acknowledge us immediately. We asked where could we come and collect\
  \ our phone. He said after he is done with his mid day \u2018Namaz\u2019 he will\
  \ come to our hotel lobby and return it personally. True to his word, he came to\
  \ see us after half an hour and handed me over my phone. I was moved beyond words,\
  \ did not know how to thank the guy. I felt so lucky. I offered him RM 15, more\
  \ than the fare we paid earlier as a token of thanks; he refused to take it saying\
  \ it is his duty to look after the well being of guests in his country. But we could\
  \ not let him go without proper thanks, we insisted he should have dinner with us\
  \ that evening, on which he thankfully agreed. We had dinner, we came to know Muhammed\
  \ Azif is an educated man running a successful travel business. We made a friend\
  \ for life.\n\nThis experience made me realize that good people exist everywhere\
  \ in the guises of \u2018Messiahs\u2019 irrespective of country, religion and gender."
