Text: "Where can  a poor go!? Alas! Having heard intermittent lauds of foreign and\
  \ national  visitors about their travel experiences in Lucknow, I decided to make\
  \ a local connection myself with my city. At a distance of barely two kilometers\
  \ from my home, the lanes of Chowk where I had thought of strolling and finding\
  \ the  reasons behind foreigners' attraction to them, and supposing myself as an\
  \ outsider, I made myself ready for the local adventure by programming my brain\
  \ to wash all hundreds of thoughts of visiting the place before.  Let me give you\
  \ a thousand dollar advise- Don't spend on any three or a five star hotel food if\
  \ you are to visit Chowk area of the city because eating twice throughout a week\
  \ in its lanes will cost less than a thousand dollar as compared to eating once\
  \ in an opulent hotel. \n\nThe narrow lanes of Chowk, the reminisce of 18th and\
  \ 19th century miniature Las Vegas in desi style  display the old time brothel buildings\
  \ with hand craved designs on their parapets and walls. The lanes are as if you\
  \ are reading a poem imbued wiith all kinds of palpable imageries-  'tunde kebabs'\
  \ with their melt-in-mouth distinction amongst all kebabs of the world will make\
  \ you wish for a hunger manifold times. Here you will sense the imagery of taste;\
  \ the handcrafted chikan designs on suits and kurtas and the glittery embroidery\
  \ works on sarees and sherwanis that adorn brides and bridegrooms respectively,\
  \ are a delight for your eyes. And here you will sense the imagery of sight; the\
  \ shrinking old and young voices raising Arabic and Urdu recitations, and orations,\
  \ and the tapping of cylindrical tools for making foils of real gold and silver\
  \ shall nudge your ear drums to experience the imagery of sound;the aromas of Nahari,\
  \ Kebabs , and Biryani that surround you with layers of palpable smell shall make\
  \ you find the imagery of smell. The food within and in the vicinity of the lanes\
  \ is so enticingly variable that once you start to gormandize on a  mystically blended\
  \ spices in  a dish conjuring you for successive days, you are wonder struck with\
  \ the realization that there are more food items to magnetize you. The local chefs\
  \ and cooks would delightfully tell you, trying hard to speak in English, about\
  \ how they make their dishes, and  the history behind each. \n\n   Human happiness\
  \ lies in invigorating all five senses and if you are in or around those lanes you\
  \ are sure to be happy in all ways, as someone has truly said, \"Smile that you\
  \ are in Lucknow!\""
