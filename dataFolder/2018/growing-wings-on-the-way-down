Text: "An 8.5 second free fall, a deceleration force and then a smile.\n\nI take my\
  \ time working at heights in the winery. I carefully step up and down stairs and\
  \ for extra safety, I avert my eyes from the ground while on the catwalks. When\
  \ vertigo creeps in at the top of a tank I wait out the swaying that causes clammy\
  \ hands and weak knees. \n\nI suspect my grandfather is to blame for the mistrust\
  \ in my ability to balance - at the age of 3 he sat me on an edge of the Eiffel\
  \ Tower.\n\nSo when Jessa - my thrill-loving, purple haired, wildflower of a friend\
  \ - suggested we take a month to travel around the edge of the world that is New\
  \ Zealand, seeking adventure and adrenaline most likely involving mountain peaks\
  \ and sky towers and suspension bridges (oh my), I told her to take a hike.\n\n\
  Six months later at the pinnacle of summer, we stood in line at Fergburger in Queenstown,\
  \ NZ fueling up on nourishment before the drive to the Nevis Playground. My nerves\
  \ were at their height, causing the reversal of my chicken burger and fries into\
  \ a paper bag. Adding to my nausea was the decoding of the cryptic number on my\
  \ left hand which Jessa so kindly revealed to be my weight in kilos. Ignorance would\
  \ have been more blissful. \n\nI\u2019d never seen anything like this canyon, nor\
  \ the Jump Pod floating in the air. Directly below, the rocky, frothing Nevis River.\
  \ My heart knocked in its cage.\n\n\u201CWho? Who did this to me?\u201D I begged\
  \ of no one in particular. Surely I, the girl notably wary of being too high off\
  \ the ground, didn\u2019t sign away my life to New Zealand\u2019s highest bungy\
  \ jump that boasts 134 meters. \n\nMy bungy guide was almost through harnessing\
  \ me in when he sensed my jitters. He introduced himself as James, a soothing angel\
  \ of a man whose freckles kept me distracted from the glass floor of the Jump Pod.\
  \ I waddled to the platform, vertigo coming with me. He grabbed my straps and in\
  \ an almost whisper, hurriedly offered this: \u201CJump on 3. You\u2019ll be legendary\
  \ back home. And most importantly, it\u2019s physically impossible to vomit upside\
  \ down.\u201D \n\nOn that edge, I made the decision to be my own legend and kick\
  \ fear off the map, if only momentarily. I jumped outward in a swan dive worthy\
  \ of a 5.5 out of 10 and plummeted towards earth. \n\nIn the pod Jessa pulled me\
  \ in for a tight hug as James exclaimed \u201CWicked as!\u201D I didn\u2019t stop\
  \ smiling for days to come. \n\nI don\u2019t bungy off wine tanks in Oregon these\
  \ days, but my mental muscles are strengthened to face my fears and seek the adventures\
  \ that lie ahead."
