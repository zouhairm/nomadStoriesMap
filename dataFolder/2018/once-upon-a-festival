Text: "The train follows the winding riverbanks of the Mosel River, the sun shining\
  \ on valleys and mountains, hillsides of vineyards and dense forest. Outside the\
  \ train station, cobblestone streets pass under archways of grape vines, past charming\
  \ homes, welcoming storefronts and caf\xE9s. Music fills the air as people gather\
  \ to celebrate their cultures and love for song and dance. Welcome to festival season\
  \ in the village of Winningen in Western Germany.\nThe community of 2400 is home\
  \ to forty full and part-time wineries. Amicable rivalry as to whose Riesling or\
  \ Pinot Noir wines are the best, and a strong sense of pride in their craft is shared\
  \ amongst the villagers. I visited during the International Folklore Festival held\
  \ every six years, in association with CIOFF and UNESCO. It is a magical four days\
  \ of performances, tours, boat cruises, parades and late nights at the only pub\
  \ in town. \nOverseeing festivities are Winningen\u2019s cherished personalities,\
  \ the Wine Witch and Wine Queen. It began with a winemaker, his best barrel vintage,\
  \ and a thief in the night. Circa 17th century, amidst a history of war, plague\
  \ and witch hunts, winemakers of Winningen struggled to build a life for themselves.\
  \ Rumours spread of a mysterious being that would prowl into one winemaker\u2019\
  s cellar after he retired for the night and steal a pitcher of his best wine. Annoyed\
  \ by the loss, the man lay in wait to expose the identity of the thief. Discovering\
  \ his wife as the culprit, he banished her from the village as a witch. Wine from\
  \ that barrel was termed the Witch\u2019s Wine, and the story has shaped local folklore,\
  \ surrounded by charm and mysticism. It is tradition that every few years, two local\
  \ women are chosen as Wine Witch and Wine Queen. Adorned in stunning ball gowns\
  \ and tiaras, they raise comically large wineglasses in a toast, acting as town\
  \ ambassadors during the Folklore Festival, the annual Wine Witch Festival, and\
  \ other village events.\nWith a wine glass in one hand and a bottle in the other,\
  \ you can join the crowd that fills the village square for performances during the\
  \ festival, or meander through town taking in the sights. Hike up a vineyard if\
  \ you feel inspired, check out the local museum, or visit one of the neighboring\
  \ town\u2019s castles. The balance of excitement and serenity makes this place something\
  \ special. Life moves slower here, yet each moment seems magical and fulfilling.\
  \ Experiencing Winningen reminded me that life itself is the most wonderful fairy\
  \ tale."
