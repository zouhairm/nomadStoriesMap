Text: "A traveler can always get first- hand experience of a place, its culture and\
  \ tradition through the locals there. Hence, to understand the concept and ideologies\
  \ of a \u201Cuniversal township\u201D which stands out like a mystery to the world,\
  \ I was helped by my friend Daniel from Germany, who had spent a year volunteering\
  \ here. The \u201Ccity of dawn\u201D, a world in itself where nationality has no\
  \ role to play. Rather, it is the interest and a sense of belonging that pulls one\
  \ to this universal township. Some come as visitors or volunteers while for a few\
  \ chosen ones; it becomes a home that they spend their lives in. \n\nOne such lady\
  \ was Aurore, who shares her name with the city. She expressed how an awakening\
  \ in Mathrimandir (a spiritual temple of Internal Yoga and the center of Auroville)\
  \ transformed her into an ardent Aurovillian. Her spinster life made it easier to\
  \ leave her Insurance Consultant career in France and live in Auroville out of choice.\
  \ \n\nAurovillians could leave for three months in a year, which keeps them back\
  \ in the community as an obligation. Hence, getting to be a part of Auroville is\
  \ not an easy task, but that of commitment towards the society.\n\nAlex, for example\
  \ is an independent lady who travels widely but remains to be an Aurovillian. She\
  \ sits gracefully as the librarian at \u201CFreeland Bookstore\u201D, which supports\
  \ her basic needs. \u201CAurovillians would take up various jobs within Auroville\
  \ to make a living. We also have a Youth Society which is a self- sufficient one,\
  \ made of youths of varied nationalities\u201D, explained Alex. \n\nTo meet people\
  \ from different parts of the world coming together as if it was here that they\
  \ were meant to be and smiling at each other was one of the attractive sights here.\
  \ Peter, a language teacher from Italy was one such person I met in a cafe and his\
  \ emotions continue to haunt my memory. He used his skills to escape an employment\
  \ crisis back home, but continues to miss his students and land. For him Auroville\
  \ was not a choice but a refuge. \nAmong all of them, how can I forget my friend\
  \ Daniel? He was the reason behind my meetings with Aurovillians, who do not open\
  \ much to anyone. He shared how the place inspired him to stay for a year and volunteer\
  \ as a farmer, right after his visit to meet a friend.\n\nIn true essence, Auroville\
  \ continues to awe visitors, give experience to volunteers and becomes home to people\
  \ truly of its kind, and one cannot know this mysterious society unless they make\
  \ a local connection with its people."
