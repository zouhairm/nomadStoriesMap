Text: "Contradictions. \n\nWhat better way to sum up my year in Thailand. A society\
  \ where rules favour the men, yet so many young boys choose to live in the feminine.\
  \ A space where good girls are taught to focus not on their looks and to cover from\
  \ their shoulders to their knee\u2019s, yet simply the pigment of their skin, can\
  \ define both their class and their future. It was a confusing world, but it was\
  \ one filled with sunset covered paddy fields, charming, genuine smiles and welcoming\
  \ food that tasted divine. \n\nHowever, the contradictions that troubled me most,\
  \ were not from what I observations, but rather, from how I felt. To this very day,\
  \ years later, I sit noting that living away from my family in a new, mysterious\
  \ land was one of the hardest things I have ever done. Yet as I think these thoughts,\
  \ my heart cries to return; wishing I could explain to those I loved each detail\
  \ of complexity. Then I remember a moment, simple and pure, that sums up these feelings\
  \ in a snapshot. \n\nIt was 24th October. Monsoon rains gathered around the school\
  \ complex, as the teachers of Nakae Phittayakhom decided that this was the perfect\
  \ day to celebrate halloween. I walked into my first class of the week, watermelons\
  \ in hand, ready to carve faces into the closest pumpkin shaped fruit I could find.\
  \ A ring of friendly voices echoed \"morning teacher\" as I placed them onto the\
  \ desk and explained. \n\nThat morning I had cried, just as I had each day before,\
  \ confused about the mixed emotions of excitement and loneliness. But little did\
  \ I know, this would be the last day that the water hitting my face would come from\
  \ anywhere but the clouds. \n\nI explained the concept of halloween to my students\
  \ and watched as a wave of faces lit up with relief and intrigue, as they realised\
  \ todays class would be a practical lesson. Groups formed and eager teenagers got\
  \ hard to work, too engrossed in the task to realise they had been speaking to me\
  \ in English, free of apprehension. The room charged with a bubble of noise that\
  \ could make even the loneliest of people feel full inside. \n\nI carried on with\
  \ every class, growing in confidence by the hour, until finally Friday came. By\
  \ the time the week was complete, I had over 50 carving creations lined across the\
  \ garden. On the patio, I thought of the trick or treaters back home, as I illuminated\
  \ each and every face that encircled my house. \n\nMy usual visitors from nearby\
  \ arrived. We sat, we ate, we gazed and we laughed. This was my community. At last,\
  \ I was home."
