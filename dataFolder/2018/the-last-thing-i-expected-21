Text: "Here I was on my first trip to the remote village of Abat, in the South West\
  \ region of my country. I could never imagine that I would find myself visiting\
  \ that part of the country for whatever reason. But the universe has a sense of\
  \ humour in its way of crafting circumstances that bring the unexpected to you.\
  \ I was simply chosen among my colleagues to accompany this Spanish man, in his\
  \ early sixties, a representative of an organisation that hoped to install pipe-borne\
  \ water in Abat. \nJuan Ignatio chose for us to experience the peculiarities of\
  \ travelling with the locals, in the local way. It was going to be with a minibus.\
  \ I was lucky enough to get a seat by the window \u2013 very much coveted by passengers.\
  \ Juan Ignatio did not mind sitting in the middle, between me and the middle-aged\
  \ man with a forest-like beard, who wouldn\u2019t stop conversing with Juan since\
  \ our arrival at the park. He had a rather unkempt appearance, even though he sounded\
  \ quite learned when he spoke. \nAn hour and forty minutes into our trip, we were\
  \ in K-town, the main commercial town in the English-speaking side of the country.\
  \ The city is a hub for different nationals from neighboring countries, especially\
  \ Nigerians.\n\u201CSay, Juan Ignatio\u201D, I started, \u201COn your next trip\
  \ to Cameroon\u2026 who knows? May be we will have time in our hands for a real\
  \ tour. Nothing related to your work nor mine.\u201D\n\u201CAnd where exactly do\
  \ you plan on taking him? The Botanic Gardens?\" That was the irritating voice of\
  \ our unkempt, bearded neighbor. By implication, he was saying I didn\u2019t know\
  \ much.\nThe bus was pulled over. We were at a police stop. All they had to do was\
  \ verify our identity cards. The young police officer presented himself and began\
  \ the check. \n\u201CI can\u2019t find my card,\u201D I confessed. \u201CI think\
  \ I left it on the ticketer\u2019s desk.\u201D\n\u201CWhat would they do to you?\u201D\
  \ Juan Ignatio sounded concerned already.\n\u201CThey will keep him hear\u201D,\
  \ said the shabby man with an evil grin on his face.\nThe officer got to me finally\
  \ and I simply stared. Then, almost immediately, he had a smile on his face. He\
  \ was looking past me. \n\u201CSalut mon commissaire,\u201D he said -- French for\
  \ \u201CHello, my commissioner.\u201D I turned around to see who he was addressing.\
  \ To my greatest disbelief, it was our bearded companion. The man was indeed a police\
  \ commissioner. Why he looked so untidy, remain a mystery till date. I wasn\u2019\
  t going to ask him after he came to my rescue. He was only going to be a part of\
  \ my story as I journeyed to the remote village of Abat."
