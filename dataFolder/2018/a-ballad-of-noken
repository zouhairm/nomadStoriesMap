Text: "\u201CWe make a living from weaving noken, and ... on the sidelines, gardening\
  \ and farming,\u201D a woman named Yustina, who lives in the rural area of Jayapura,\
  \ Papua, Indonesia, recalled. I myself flew from Jakarta, the capital of Indonesia,\
  \ for about 8 hours, to reach Papua.\n\nAt this time, in the middle of a customary\
  \ forest guarded by a Papuan named Alex Waisimon, we sit under a simple hay-roof\
  \ gazebo. It is raining, so we had to take shelter. Meanwhile, Mama Yustina and\
  \ several other women are weaving the dried wood fibers into a typical Papuan traditional\
  \ bag called noken.\n\n\u201CMy mama (mother) also made noken. I've learned to make\
  \ a noken from mama when I was 11 years old,\u201D said Mama Yustina who is now\
  \ 54. I see four women belonging to the women group of noken named Isyo Ki with\
  \ eyes shining. Isyo Ki actually has 15 members, all of whom are women. It's just\
  \ that on Sunday the 5th of February today, when Papuan celebrates \u201Cthe first\
  \ day the gospel went to Papua\u201D. The day is a national holiday, and many people\
  \ go to church on this national holiday. So, only four people come today.\n\nEvery\
  \ now and then, I hear the sounds of the birds from the forest with a melodious\
  \ song. In the customary forest, live the endemic birds of Papua, such as Cenderawasih\
  \ and Cassowary. However, in the rest of the time, I mostly admire these women,\
  \ especially falling in love with their beautiful thick curly hair, typical of the\
  \ hair of Papuans. Afterwards, I just in love with their dancing fingers; weaving\
  \ the dried wood fibers into bags. Vivacious!\n\nOccasionally, while weaving noken,\
  \ these women love to sing. \"So we don\u2019t get bored easily,\" said the four\
  \ moms almost in the same time. That day, mama-mama sang a Papuan-language song\
  \ called \"Kuyumbe\". The song is accompanied by traditional Papuan drums called\
  \ tifa, played by Mama Yustina.\n\nI do not understand the lyrics of the song. However,\
  \ it is as melodious as it sounds. Afterwards, Mama Yustina told me that the song\
  \ is about how nature happens, the world we have, we have to take care of it, and\
  \ use it wisely. Super deep.\n\nIn the middle of the indigenous forest that day,\
  \ amid the sound of tifa and the women\u2019s voice, between the sounds of the singing\
  \ birds, I live in that moment. I am learning."
