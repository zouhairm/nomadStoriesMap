Text: "Early one Saturday morning, I rise quietly with the intent of bird-watching\
  \ at a pretty park I noticed while walking back from work a few days ago. After\
  \ dressing lightly because of Wuhan\u2019s hot sun, I quietly slip outside of my\
  \ hotel into the bustling city. After passing a huge monument dedicated to a Communist\
  \ revolutionary, I enter the park, which teems with people at this early hour. Groups\
  \ of men and women walk the twisting paths, while others sit in delightful pagodas\
  \ playing Mahjongg. On the square in the middle of the park, pairs play badminton,\
  \ while a small group follows a Tai Chi routine. Their leader transitions gracefully\
  \ from movement to movement like running water. She incorporates a sword with a\
  \ rich red tassel swinging from the bottom of the handle into her movements; some\
  \ of the others have similar swords, but a few have to make do with their umbrellas.\
  \ \nThe park eventually leads to the back of a large complex of yellow buildings\
  \ with tiered red roofs; these are part of a temple I visited the other day. But\
  \ as I enter, I realize that something has changed; the temple has awakened. The\
  \ ornate incense burners positioned around the multiple courtyards are now lit and\
  \ burning with an intense crackling flame. From within the elaborate golden Buddha\
  \ shrines, I hear a mysterious chanting. Afraid to go in, I peer around the corner\
  \ of the entrance and spot a group of distinguished-looking monks clothed in golden\
  \ yellow sitting around a table singing a hymn. Tears sting my eyes as I watch the\
  \ swaying of their bodies and the devotion in their eyes. Later on, as I enter the\
  \ office building where I work, I hear the famous Flower Duet from the French opera\
  \ Lakm\xE9 blaring over the loudspeakers, which all but washes away any memory of\
  \ the Buddhist monks.\nIn one morning I have witnessed, frozen in time like a highly-coveted\
  \ snapshot, a complex country changing so quickly that nobody can catch hold of\
  \ it. Reeling with dizziness from the memory of incense and ancient chant paired\
  \ with the air-conditioning and sleek tile of the trade building, I step excitedly\
  \ into the elevator, eager to return to the park next weekend. This time, though,\
  \ I will not go to watch birds."
