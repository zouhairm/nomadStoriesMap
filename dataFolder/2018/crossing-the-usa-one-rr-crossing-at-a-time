Text: "I departed Union Station in Portland on a sunny summer afternoon. I was determined\
  \ to see the Northern half of the beautiful United States of America from coast\
  \ to coast from the train tracks moving along on Amtrak. I had heard poor reviews\
  \ of train travels in the United States and wanted to find out first hand what it\
  \ was like. \nThe adventure started out as I had dreamed, amazing closeup views\
  \ of the Columbia River in the Gorge, waking up to magestic ice cream topped mountains\
  \ of White Fish Montana. It was a great 17 hours until trains were changed in Chicago.\
  \ As day turned to night and magestic mountain became prairie lands the train would\
  \ come to an abrupt halt in Somewhere N Dakota in the dead of the night. The passengers\
  \ were ushered off of the train to awaken in a smothering humid hot box of a dark\
  \ summer night. We were told a spring had broke holding the train cars together.\
  \ This would be the beginning of one failed derailment after another on board the\
  \ train across country of the US of A. \nThe train rumbled as it crossed the great\
  \ Mississippi. Don\u2019t get to hungry and be cash strapped because I would find\
  \ out the credit card machine on the train often does not work and not much sympathy\
  \ will be shown by the attendants. Oh well,  The bathrooms will quickly deteriorate\
  \ as the miles pass by with nobody cleaning them and the stench makes the hungry\
  \ appetite disappear. \nThe train will eventually pull into Washington DC Union\
  \ Station at the other side of the country. As I walk into the vast architecturally\
  \ pleasing building I am taken back to the time of what train travel used to be.\
  \ Perhaps I would be dressed in my finest, feeling special as I departed the train\
  \ and walked through the station. Today I am surrounded by humans still wearing\
  \ their fleece pink pajamas.\nAll of this was not enough for me. I had planned to\
  \ make this a round trip voyage. It wasn\u2019t so bad I thought! I was up for a\
  \ return! Little did I know though that the trains in the US in the summer have\
  \ to go very slow as they overheat often.  And sadly I learned that elderly  people\
  \ occasionally die on the train and have to be dropped off at the closest station.\
  \ As if this is not enough, I found out that if you lose your paper copy of your\
  \ ticket the agent in Chicago can\u2019t look you up in the computer system and\
  \ will inform you that you have to buy another ticket. However. a good mental breakdown\
  \ in the supervisors office Will get you on the next train home."
