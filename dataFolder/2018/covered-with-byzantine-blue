Text: "When I think of Serbia the first thing that crosses my mind is the famous Exit\
  \ Festival or very exciting nightlife. The last thing I expected that there are\
  \ so many hidden cultural and natural places to visit. I live in the region but\
  \ I have never heard of them. What caught my attention were hundred years old monasteries,\
  \ hidden in the hills.I decided to go on a road trip to visit historically important\
  \ Manasija Monastery, the breath-taking Resava cave and the lovely Veliki Buk waterfall\
  \ located in the Resava Valley. \nWhat makes Serbian monasteries interesting and\
  \ mystic is their location. Surrounded by beautiful nature they stay hidden from\
  \ the main roads and can be very hard to access. Yet, they remained there for centuries\
  \ representing the meaningful cultural and historical heritage of the country. The\
  \ Manasija Monastery was founded by the Serbian ruler Stefan Lazarevi\u0107 known\
  \ also as Stefan the Tall (1389-1427). The church of the Holy Trinity is surrounded\
  \ by a fortress with 11 towers.\nInside the church, I ran into a very nice tour\
  \ guide who introduced me to the turbulent past of the monastery. Stefan the Tall\
  \ brought the finest painters, mostly from Greek islands to work on the frescoes\
  \ in the church. They used gold and Byzantine blue, which at that time was even\
  \ more expensive than gold and symbolize the ruler\u2019s power. Unfortunately only\
  \ a third of the frescoes survive today. After the invasion of the Ottoman Empire\
  \ and the fall of Manasija, everything that was valuable was taken. During the five\
  \ centuries of Ottoman rule, the monastery was completely destroyed. The church\
  \ was turned into a stable and arms and gunpowder were kept in the outer entrance\
  \ hall, which led to several explosions.\nJust 20 km drive from Manasija I arrived\
  \ to the breathtaking Resava cave. Millions of years old passages with stalagmites\
  \ and stalactites are perfectly illuminated which gives another dose of mysticism.\n\
  Later on, I was driving for another twenty minutes to the Veliki Buk waterfall -\
  \ one of Serbia\u2019s few waterfalls and quite a romantic spot.  Near the waterfall,\
  \ there are several restaurants that offer traditional Serbian food. I highly recommend\
  \ the trout with potatoes and vegetables, homemade bread, traditional Serbian creamy\
  \ product kajmak and peeper with cream. It was delicious and overall the meal was\
  \ very cheap.\nWhile visiting all these sites, I was driving through country roads\
  \ and enjoying beautiful nature, so while in Serbia it is well worth of visit."
