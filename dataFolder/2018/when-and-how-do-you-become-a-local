Text: "At breakfast it hails.  At 10 o'clock when we walk out, sunshine streams down\
  \ and the temperature in my waterproofs soars.\n\nWe are heading for The Strand,\
  \ a mile of low lying sand and mud flats, between Colonsay and the smaller island\
  \ of Oransay.  Lines of coruscating white foam mark the intersection of the sea\
  \ with the land. The beaches, vast, flat and unpeopled, stretch for miles and acres.\n\
  \nAcross on the flat landscape of Oransay we see the ruins we are searching for.\
  \  A mass of dark stone buildings hunkered down beside the ocean.  Roofless gables\
  \ stand out against the pale silver sky; soaring arched windows, their stone mullions\
  \ no longer glazed, but their stonework restored, frame tranquil, far reaching views.\
  \ The wind is ceaseless, and the sea and the sky stretch out in every direction.\
  \  Surely here the Augustinians must have felt so very close to God. \n\nOn a mound\
  \ close by is a towering standing stone.  Surprised, we realise it is a modern memorial:\
  \  I W Colburn Architect 1924 \u2013 1992. Who would put such a thing here beside\
  \ an Augustinian Abbey?  There is an inscription on the back: \u2018The Soul Is\
  \ Known By Its Acts.\u2019\n\nAs we return to The Strand the sand is already covered\
  \ with shallow water. It is a mile back to Colonsay. We wade gently out and when\
  \ we reach the middle we pause; the water is approaching the top of our boots. \
  \ We consider, home now and wet feet, home later, much later, and dry feet.  Close\
  \ beside us the water starts to slap and splash and suddenly rises up in a great\
  \ silver fin and moves like a band saw through the surface. We have two seals for\
  \ company, chasing fish in the shallow water in dramatic fashion. They are very,\
  \ very, fast and the water is only just deep enough to cover them.\n\nSoon Oronsay\
  \ will be cut off. We move forward, flinch as the seawater surmounts our boots and\
  \ fills them up, shockingly cold against hot feet. The water level continues to\
  \ rise, past our knees to mid-thigh.  We wade on. I feel the tightness in the muscles\
  \ at the front of my hip and realise how much strength it takes to wade through\
  \ deep water.\n\nLater we sit in the cheerful hotel garden, our faces turned to\
  \ the sun, our wet socks jiggling in the breeze on a tree bedecked with blossom.\
  \  Locals tell us of the American who purchased the farm on which the ruins stand.\
  \ Ike Colburn, was an architect.  He had no responsibility for the maintenance of\
  \ the abbey buildings but spent about a million pounds restoring the ruins. \n\n\
  His soul will be known by his acts."
