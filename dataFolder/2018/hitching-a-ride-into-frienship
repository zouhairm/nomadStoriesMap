Text: "It's 6:03am in Aman Singh's cabin of his 18 wheeler. A picture of a Sikh guru\
  \ is surrounded by flashing lights, the roof and back wall are a combined poster\
  \ of Punjabi dancers oozing energy. Blasting from the radio is said Punjabi music,\
  \ feeding the excitement of our early morning. There\u2019s a coloured fan, a box\
  \ of bidis, various coloured blankets and a lighter hanging from the ceiling. And\
  \ that\u2019s just the stuff! The passengers he picked up, are much more absurd.\n\
  \ Cue my hitch hiking companion and I. He is bearded and long haired, owner of juggling\
  \ clubs, a hula hoop, and more carabiners than he currently has use for. I have\
  \ a freshly shaven head, am barefoot and the owner of not much at all. We washed\
  \ our faces last night, though the last time we showered is now days in the past.\
  \ In the Where\u2019s Waldo edition of the highways of India we stand out like very\
  \ sore thumbs. Aman and his assistant, otherwise known as our new best friends,\
  \ are smiling from either side of us. They know these roads as old friends. They\
  \ have long standing quarrels with some of the bumpiest and dustiest like they have\
  \ fond memories of the Punjabi owned truck stops and restaurants along other stretches.\
  \ And now, they are inducting us into their lives with an intimacy almost unheard\
  \ of between strangers today.\n We stood with our cardboard sign on the border of\
  \ India and Nepal. Sweating, we smiled at the passing traffic. Aman caught our eye.\
  \ Stopped his truck. Said he was headed within spitting distance of the sacred Varansi\
  \ - the name scrawled in English and Hindi on our cardboard. We piled in and began\
  \ our drive into friendship. We exchanged pictures of our family. Aman has two young\
  \ kids, like I have two younger brothers, like my companion has two younger sisters.\
  \ We constantly stopped for chai and to share jokes translated via Google. As brakes\
  \ squealed to pause for a cow passing, we exchanged views on the pursuit of the\
  \ American Dream - Aman held out hope, my companion did not. Floods had us running\
  \ late, so Aman invited us to sleep head to tail with him in his cabin too. The\
  \ day was a crash course in friendship: trust, sharing families and hopeful dreams.\n\
  \ It's 6:03am, a golden glow glamorizes the grit trailing behind the semi trailers\
  \ and elevates the dilapidated rickshaws into colourful works of art. I think we\
  \ have an innate ability to connect with strangers - if only we expose ourselves\
  \ to the world and allow ourselves to be welcomed into someone else's bubble of\
  \ experience."
