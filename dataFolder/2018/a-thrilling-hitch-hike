Text: "I started shivering underneath 4 layers of clothing at Rohtang pass in the\
  \ Pir Panjal Range in The Himalayas. The landscape looked other-worldly- neither\
  \ a soul nor a tree around, covered in a thin sheet of morning snow, snowy peaks\
  \ rising all around, and sun slowly creeping into view. I could barely feel my hands\
  \ and my body, the cold was debilitating.\nFinally a beautifully decorated truck\
  \ pulled over and swung its heavy door open. They asked if we were in for a detour\
  \ to Leh, which was at an unimaginable distance way up in the hills. With roads\
  \ to Spiti closed we had no choice but to either go on or turn back and go home.\
  \ But we chose the former instinctively and that made all the difference. \nGradually,\
  \ the roads became treacherous, precariously perched on the outlines of the hills\
  \ way up in the sky. We were tossed all around the driver\u2019s cabin as Parbinder\
  \ carefully navigated us through the terrain with admirable efficiency. By the view\
  \ from the window, it looked as if we could plummet into the deep valley right below\
  \ us. \nThe journey was fun until disaster struck around dusk; we got a flat tire,\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. Darkness spread over the snowy mountains and we couldn\u2019\
  t help but panic. Hunger set in and suddenly there were utensils, cooking gas, gas\
  \ stove, vegetables, pulses, and spices, dished out from the many hidden wardrobes\
  \ inside the cabin. A well calculated mixture of potatoes, rice, pulses and a handful\
  \ of spices was set to boil and we patiently waited in front of the small pressure\
  \ cooker. And when it rang out a long steamy whistle, the aroma of spices in the\
  \ Khichdi spread inside the cabin and finally there was an expression of joy on\
  \ all faces.\nAt night, completely immobilized between the steering wheels and the\
  \ engine box we popped our heads out and waited for sleep. But we were distracted\
  \ by something; the inviting starry skies outside. I saw my favorite constellation,\
  \ the Orion before we fell into a dreamless sleep.\nA heavenly view greeted us as\
  \ we opened our eyes the next morning; the bare mountains, crisp blue skies, with\
  \ sun casting long pointed shadows everywhere. We sat staring into the open landscape,\
  \ barren and lifeless apart from these brown rocky structures towering all around\
  \ us. Our bhaiyyas set the fire beneath the diesel tank; the temperatures had surely\
  \ dropped really low that it froze the fuel.\nThe wait lasted until the next day\
  \ when help finally arrived and we bid farewell to that unforgiving landscape"
