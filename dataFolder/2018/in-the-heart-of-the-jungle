Text: "Before entering, Rama shared some words of wisdom: If see tiger, together,\
  \ make big, loud! If see sloth bear, together, make big, loud! If see Rhino, stop,\
  \ quiet. If rhino come, find tree, climb, fast! \n\nWe found ourselves in the Heart\
  \ of the Jungle, translated from the Sanskrit name Chitwan, a National Park in southern\
  \ Nepal. The area saw a gross amount of poaching in the 1950s, and by the 60s, Chitwan\u2019\
  s 800 rhinos had dropped to under 100. This led the government to form the Gaida\
  \ Gasti, a patrol of 130 men charged with protecting the park\u2019s remaining rhinos.\
  \ \n\nYet, with the protection of one group came the relocation of another: the\
  \ native Tharu people were forced off their traditional lands. Some refused to leave,\
  \ and were met with violence, others became homeless, and many more settled in the\
  \ surrounding area. They created villages from the ground up, from mixtures of sand,\
  \ bamboo, and cow dung. It was in one of these small villages, with walls as smooth\
  \ as silk, where I found Rama and Baji: my guides. \n\nBaji spoke only Urdu, and\
  \ smiled with a missing tooth, while Rama maneuvered in broken English, and a network\
  \ of deep wrinkles flowed from his eyes when he laughed. They were to lead a four-day\
  \ tour through Chitwan. We shouldered our packs and began our journey on a canoe,\
  \ pushing away from the shore and into the wild. \n\nThe seriousness in Rama\u2019\
  s voice had caused a mix of awe and fear. After 40 years of protection, Chitwan\
  \ now hosts the densest population of sloth bears, an abundance of Bengal tigers,\
  \ and the most rhinos in the country. \n\nWe hoped to see wildlife, but I suppose\
  \ viewing distance was the important factor in this hope. In we went. \n\nThere\
  \ was a silence in the jungle. It was made from the lack of cars and voices, it\
  \ was found in the rhythm between footsteps, like the space between sentences. \n\
  \nBaji held up his hand to break the silence. Two giant rhinos were a stone\u2019\
  s throw away. \n\nWe stared at them, and they at us, straining to see any sign of\
  \ movement.\n\nAfter what felt like an hour, one rhino began tilting his head down.\
  \ We had to think quick.\n\nAs I slowly backpedaled and surveyed the nearby trees,\
  \ Baji and Rama signaled and lifted their walking sticks to beat the ground in unison:\
  \ thump, thump, thump.\n\nThe rhinos froze, and then without warning they turned\
  \ and stormed away, creating a wake of broken branches on their path. \n\nWe looked\
  \ at each other, and then laughed. I now understood just what it meant to be in\
  \ the heart of the jungle."
