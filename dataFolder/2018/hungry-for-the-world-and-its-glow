Text: "We trekked for 12 kms to reach the diversion which leads to \u201CUgrasthambha\u201D\
  , a trek within a trek. Fellow trekkers who were returning recommended us to avoid\
  \ as it is a tough one. \nWe disregarded their advice and to our dismay, found that\
  \ next 50 meters are full of pebbles. There is nothing to hold onto and the pebbles\
  \ are not providing a grip. We managed to scale the pebble zone after slipping couple\
  \ of times. After forty minutes of arduous trek, we reached the top with the wind\
  \ hitting us in the face. We dropped our backpacks in exhaustion and decided to\
  \ check out the edge of the cliff without luggage. We crossed horizontal ladders\
  \ which were tied to the rocks with rope to reach edge. New ropes were being added\
  \ from time to time to ensure safety. When we reached the edge, we noticed the idol\
  \ of \u201CNarasimha\u201D with a kindled lamp. While we are taking stock of valley\u2019\
  s beauty from cliff, fellow trekkers who arrived shortly alerted about monkeys sifting\
  \ through our backpacks. We had to pull every ounce of energy to run to our bags.\
  \ When we went to our bags, all of them are opened with food items \u2013 oranges,\
  \ maggi, date palms -  claimed. Interestingly, monkeys left a bundle of five thousand\
  \ rupees. With a heavy heart, we started our return journey as we lost our food.\
  \ It took us 60 minutes to scale down. Rather than returning, we decided to stay\
  \ at Jwala Narasimha temple at the base. We went to the temple and reached priest\u2019\
  s hut next to it. We told the priest that we have decided to spend the night there\
  \ and enquired if we can get any food. He responded that it is the will of the god\
  \ that we have decided to spend our night there. \nPriest has provided us with food\
  \ along with curries he has prepared. Sensing the cold, he has set up some firewood\
  \ to keep us warm. When we offered to pitch our tent in the open, he suggested that\
  \ stones might fall from the cliff when animals move in the night. He suggested\
  \ us to sleep in the temple, his usual place, by offering his blankets. Devoid of\
  \ pollution, the sky is clear with shining stars. Though we were tired, the whole\
  \ situation seemed magical. We were quick to sleep and woke up to the early devotees.\
  \ We woke up to find beautiful valley next to temple. When we checked our bag, we\
  \ found that monkeys forgot to make away with a loaf of bread and grapes inside\
  \ pocket. We gratefully gave them to the priest. We got to spend the new year night\
  \ away from mobile signals close to nature as per our plan.Drove back to normal\
  \ life again."
