Text: "I biked 4079 miles, from New Haven \u2013 CT to Half Moon Bay \u2013 CA, building\
  \ homes for families in need... Exactly what you just thought! I was ecstatic after\
  \ seeing how amazing human beings can be and how every single one of us has the\
  \ power to change the world. My exchange program made me stop to think about my\
  \ whole life and go through a process of self-knowledge which I reinvented myself\
  \ after discovering my values and goals for my life. I was able to find a project\
  \ to fill my passion, my vocation, my career and charity needs, a project that made\
  \ me feel that I was living a life with purpose and that I was part of something\
  \ bigger than me. I started to be part of the generation that is changing the world.\
  \ The decision of accepting this trip took me to the edge.\n\nBike and Build, that\
  \ is the name of the organization that changed my life forever. Weeks of preparation,\
  \ dealing with a mix of anxiety and even some doubt about this decision, made me\
  \ strong for an amazing journey that was about to start in my life. To be brief,\
  \ Bike and Build is an organization that promotes affordable housing using cross\
  \ country trips by bicycle to raise money and awareness for the cause, but you cannot\
  \ describe B&B in words after you are part of it. I gained a new family of 31 people\
  \ who also accepted the challenge to bike from the Atlantic to the Pacific while\
  \ changing families\u2019 lives providing them a decent and affordable home to live.\n\
  \nWe crossed 17 US\u2019 states and heard the most amazing stories ever, from people\
  \ that have to tackle to try to have a decent life. I am glad that we crossed paths\
  \ and could help them to improve their families\u2019 quality of life with a home\
  \ so they can focus in education, health and culture. With this amazing experience\
  \ I have not only improved my professional skills building different kind of homes\
  \ (as energy-efficient ones), but also in all the other aspects of my life, because\
  \ that is what happen when you start the process to become a better human being.\
  \  Gratitude is the feeling that remains after learning so much with these incredible\
  \ people. I keep their stories in my mind, their strength in my arms and their love\
  \ in my heart so I can keep inspiring others to make this world a better place for\
  \ each one of us."
