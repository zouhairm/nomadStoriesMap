Text: "A very stressful job can be very hard and sometimes it's just an endless routine\
  \ of sameness.\nThis was happened to me some years ago, so I decided to make a trip\
  \ in India. \nI still hear those loud laughs, I still feel that screeching of opposites\
  \ and I still smell the odour of death.\nIt's an exacting game of strong smells,\
  \ a sound of screams and a mixture of contrasts.\nI remind the warm colours from\
  \ the intense yellow to the passionate red, the taste of the different spices from\
  \ turmeric to coriander and the beautiful textiles from the silk sari to the pashmina\
  \ scarfs.\nWhen you travel across India something happens because of the images\
  \ you see.\nIn India you are addressed in a totally different world, a world where\
  \ the main thing is getting in touch with the locals. There are old and young people,\
  \ fat and slim people, so many people. I still hear their voices, their loud voices\
  \ and their perfumes. But the real treasure are the children.\n\nThe children played\
  \ together, they quarreled by the riverbank and finally they saw you.\nThose children\
  \ were by the right side of the river.\nThey started running, coming towards you.\n\
  They were looking at you with their big eyes, so curious.\nThose  big eyes were\
  \ their soul's mirror.\nThen they donated you the only thing they could, but even\
  \ the most precious thing: their smile.\nA world that has opened my heart, has awaken\
  \ my soul, a world that has made me happy.\nBut there were not only smiles, but\
  \ even a lot of suffering.\n A lot of hunger, A lot of anger, a lot of sadness.\n\
  Only those that have felt what suffering really is  know how to smile well.\nThat\
  \ was the reason why their smiles were so real.\nSo in the reflection of the window\
  \ of the train, I remember those marvelous smiles.\nAnd while I see the landscape\
  \ passing by I realize how those smiles have been enriching me.\nThe landscape changes,\
  \ it is so mutable inside out.\nSo those smiles pushed me to the edge.\nMy inner\
  \ limit: the pursuit of happiness.\nAnd I've found it.\nThe effect of smiles and\
  \ righteousness will be quietness and confidence forever."
