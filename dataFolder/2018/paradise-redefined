Text: "Jamaica surrounds me with lush emerald foliage and a vast turquoise ocean.\
  \ I am lounging by a gentle stretch of beach, sipping from a freshly cut coconut.\
  \  Soon my husband and I will swim up to the bar for a round of pina coladas. These\
  \ are the components of our days in Ocho Rios. Despite this perfection, my mind\
  \ wanders back to the bus ride to our resort which provided our first introduction\
  \ to the paradox that is Jamaica.  Ocean views and glimpses of posh resorts contrasted\
  \ with modest homes and rustic shacks. Breathtaking beauty and poverty existing\
  \ in tandem.\n       Our resort has the feel of a beachfront estate with majestic\
  \ palms towering over sugary white sand and shimmering waters. Everyone who works\
  \ there smiles and calls me \u201CPretty Lady, Boss Lady and Princess Lady.\u201D\
  \  Quite different than the service I am accustomed to at home! Our days are indeed\
  \ indulgent, unfolding leisurely in beautiful surroundings with no responsibilities.\
  \ We are joyously here to attend a friend\u2019s wedding. The couple exchanges their\
  \ vows overlooking the ocean.  Later, a crimson sunset melts into an iridescent\
  \ moon while the reception continues on the beach.  As we dance the night away,\
  \ workers at the resort playfully join in the merriment.\n     Jamaicans have a\
  \ saying, \u201CIrie, mon,\u201D which translates into \u201CIt\u2019s all good.\u201D\
  \ More than a platitude, this phrase is a mantra woven into daily life. As we venture\
  \ off the resort to explore, it is clear to our group that the locals rely on our\
  \ tourist dollars. As we peruse wood carvings and shell jewelry at the market, there\
  \ is an underlying sense of desperation, but also an atmosphere of cooperation.\
  \ On our adventures, we stumble upon an unexpected gem of a bar situated on a peer\
  \ projecting into the ocean. A row of swings across from the bar overlook an azure\
  \ cove. We drink Appleton Rum, sipping and swinging, allowing the ocean to work\
  \ its magic. We leave the bartender a $20 tip, and he is extraordinarily grateful.\
  \ His story pours forth: he is a father, working long hours to support his family.\
  \ This gesture has made his week! Humbled, we leave with a deep awareness that behind\
  \ the beauty and smiling faces lies hard work and need. We now have a new definition\
  \ of paradise. Palm trees and ocean views are no longer its hallmark. Paradise is\
  \ found in joy, gratitude and the belief that things will work out for the best.\
  \ It is the place where there is peace with yourself and the world, all encapsulated\
  \ in one phrase: \u201CIrie.\u201D"
