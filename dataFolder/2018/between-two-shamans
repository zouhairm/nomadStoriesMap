Text: "In a candle-lit room, two crinkled Peruvian hill-tribe men sit beside me adorned\
  \ in assaultingly bright colours, as if they went to a downtown Incan market, bought\
  \ one of everything and threw it all on at once. Coca leaves laid out alongside\
  \ trinkets, flowers, stones, panpipes and, strangely, row after row of store-bought\
  \ cigarettes.\nFive people violently hallucinate, vomit into buckets, thrash around\
  \ in sleeping bags like epileptic caterpillars. \nI watch an ayahuasca ceremony.\
  \ Just watch.\nAyahuacsa is one hell of a drug. Built from 'aya', death, and 'huasca',\
  \ rope in the traditional Andean Quechua language, it is not quite phonetic: \u2018\
  eye-a-woss-ca\u2019.\nA medicinal plant brew taken from roots and bark native to\
  \ the Amazon, ayahuasca is an extreme hallucinogenic. The ways of the 'death rope'\
  \ are passed down in shamanic families from father to son across centuries. These\
  \ shamans guide sacred ceremonies, carefully treading the line between spirituality\
  \ and hallucination. Dreadlocked western drug hunters have flocked to the Amazon\
  \ to eagerly partake in their next risky existential moment, using ayahuasca as\
  \ an LSD-style drug. Shamans believe without spiritual reverence, it steals your\
  \ soul energy.\nI walk the rocked steps to the entrance to Etnika\u2019s Shamanic\
  \ Incan Retreat, about an hour outside of Cusco high in the hills of the Peruvian\
  \ Andes. \nI arrive and sit on the edge of the room. My shaman Jaime walks over\
  \ to me, shaking his head, insisting I sit up the front next to him. I'm wearing\
  \ a California Angel's hoodie; had I known I'd be on display, I would\u2019ve worn\
  \ something more spiritual.\nA rancid Macbethian witches brew, looking like it was\
  \ trawled from a dastardly swamp, the ayahuasca is held in an \u2018official\u2019\
  \ vessel \u2013 a banged-up coke bottle.\nThe shamans chant for an hour; I\u2019\
  m part of a gentle rhythmic meditation.\nBlood-curdling screams break my flow.\n\
  The ayahuasca escapes his body. As if on cue, all four others follow up with some\
  \ serious spew. The smell invades my nostrils and my body wretches. \nMy peaceful\
  \ meditation is well and truly over.\nI\u2019m wide-eyed fascination as the writhing\
  \ escalates in time to the drum. Each heaves in their own reaction. Shamans move\
  \ around, chanting, whispering, rubbing backs. Then there's me, watching, listening.\n\
  Between two shamans, I'm part of a show: a central performer who completely forgot\
  \ her lines. Caught up in ceremony, gently swaying and feel the tingle of humming\
  \ on my lips.\nI strongly consider adding to the chanting."
