Text: "The warm air smelt like turmeric, masala chai and maybe hints of goat. I landed\
  \ in Cochin and it was beautiful. We arrived at our home-stay, I went straight to\
  \ the balcony and absorbed my surroundings like a scenic sponge. The buses were\
  \ painted every bright colour with tassels and elephant ornaments hanging all around\
  \ the sides. The streets were lined with coconut trees, bright yellow flowers and\
  \ decorations. \n\nFour eager faces were staring at us from the roof next door.\
  \ I instantly waved and shouted, \u201CHello!\u201D To which one women replied,\
  \ \u201CCome here!\u201D We walked up to their room. There stood four Indian goddesses.\
  \ Only Sheeba could speak proper English. She was in her mid-thirties. She lived\
  \ in a flat with her daughter Animol, who was three, her mother, who we called Mamma\
  \ and her niece, Ruksana who was sixteen. Sheeba had a fiery curiosity about her.\
  \ She asked repeatedly, \u201CWhere is your husband?\u2019\u2019 With her head wobbling\
  \ side to side. She wouldn\u2019t believe that I wasn\u2019t married. Sheeba insisted\
  \ on speciality fish fry for dinner. Her uncle took us to the fish market in his\
  \ tuktuk. Only Sheeba joined us. \n\nThe sun was setting behind the huge Chinese\
  \ fishing nets on the water as we headed home for curry. Sheeba dished all the fish\
  \ and prawns onto our plates and gave only rice and sauce to her family. I immediately\
  \ protested and shared the fish and prawns equally between all of us. Sheeba showed\
  \ us her wedding video and after that they taught us proper Hindi dancing. Ruksana\
  \ whipped out her Henna and effortlessly drew the most exquisite and intricate henna\
  \ patterns on our hands, arms and feet. It was time for much needed rest. The next\
  \ day I went to the balcony, they were waiting for us and called us over once more.\
  \ Ruksana dressed us in sarees and bought us Jasmine flowers for our hair. She put\
  \ make up on our faces with lots of eyeliner.\n \nWe went to the beach and danced\
  \ until evening. Ruksana was having an arranged marriage the following year, she\
  \ had to stay home unless speaking to her husband. I was sad as I wanted Ruksana\
  \ with us, after all she was the saree extraordinaire. Sheeba told me that after\
  \ her arranged marriage she had to stay home with Animol although she missed being\
  \ a teacher. It was a different world for me. I shared my stories and lifestyle\
  \ with them as they shared theirs. It was ten nights of speciality fish fry. When\
  \ we said goodbye, we hugged each other tightly and cried. We promised to go back\
  \ for Ruksana\u2019s wedding but never made it in time."
