Text: "Who knew, just missing a bus could led me to this beautiful candle lit small\
  \ village house of Divya, a retired army lady with one prosthetic leg. It was 10th\
  \ May 2017 and I missed the only bus from Kolkata to Bankura where I was attending\
  \ a local fest. So, I took the one to Durgapur.\nI met her on that bus. While going\
  \ through the national highway, observing the scenic beauty of village after village\
  \ with glimpses of their daily activities through the window, we got to know each\
  \ other. Little did I know we would be on the same jeep from Durgapur to Bankura\
  \ and it would run out of gas at around 8 o\u2019 clock at night with no gas station\
  \ nearby, with only two of us left behind.\nBefore I could say anything she told\
  \ me she was a local and invited me to her house for the night which was a mile\
  \ away through a forest. I quickly said yes. I was really enjoying myself crackling\
  \ dry leaves with my shoes in that heavenly moonlit forest. Then they were there,\
  \ at least 7-8 in number at a mere distance of 10 ft. or so. I was about to scream\
  \ \u2018Wild Elephants!\u2019. They come from nearby jungles like once in every\
  \ 10 years in search of food and lucky me I was there on that very specific day.\n\
  Divya quickly stopped and shoved me into a bush nearby with a swift move, gesturing\
  \ at me to remain silent before I could even think about having a nervous breakdown.\n\
  By the time I was behind the bush my mind started working a bit and I informed the\
  \ forest dept. making as little noise as possible and saw her with awed eyes, tackling\
  \ those elephants. At one point she gave up and started screaming, telling me to\
  \ run while she would distract them, as she couldn\u2019t run with one leg.\nThen\
  \ a lot of things happened simultaneously, I heard the forest dept. car siren, pushed\
  \ Divya aside telling her to play dead, attracted all the attention towards me and\
  \ started running towards the siren. After about 30 seconds I saw those headlights.\
  \ We later found Divya still playing dead but on the top of a big tree.\nThat night\
  \ I was eating \u2018Roti-sabji\u2019 a common Indian dish at her home. Her village\
  \ was beautiful, surrounded by lakes and jungles and miles of rice fields. Everything\
  \ was so silent, it seemed unusual, as I was sure no news would be made on how she\
  \ almost sacrificed her life to save me as there wasn\u2019t one when she lost her\
  \ leg at the border. Nobody would ever know her. I spend the rest of the night without\
  \ sleeping, lying on the cot outside her house, counting stars until the east lit\
  \ up with crimson red."
