Text: "\u201CAre you Chinese?\u201D asked the old man. He was sitting in front of\
  \ me, flanked by his twin grandson whose bodies were even bigger than me. I was\
  \ on my economic seat from Yogya to Bandung City that evening. Exhausted, alone,\
  \ and anxious, yet I couldn\u2019t forbear myself to smile to that old man after\
  \ we sat in an awkward silence for over an hour.\n\n\u201CWell, yes,\u201D answered\
  \ me politely. He replied with a wide and warm smile. And as the train drove itself\
  \ passing Central Java, we started to chat and talk like old friends. Everyone on\
  \ the train starred and listened to our amicable conversation.\n===\nJudging by\
  \ its social media activity, you might think there\u2019s no peace left in Indonesia.\
  \ With such a multicultural society, even our government can\u2019t prevent all\
  \ the fuss about race, religion, clan, and political views. And with that, being\
  \ a minority in this very country may be a disadvantage.\n\nI don\u2019t deny the\
  \ fact. I remember those hard times when we secretly celebrated Imlek (Chinese New\
  \ Year) to avoid government\u2019s ban, when a stranger in my hometown screamed\
  \ my mother \u201CCino\u201D with deep hatred (\u201CCino\u201D comes from \u201C\
  Cina\u201D, which reputedly was meant for racial harrasment), and when I and my\
  \ mother almost fell down from motorbike when a group of middle-school boys tried\
  \ to kick us and shouted, \u201CWoi, Cina!\u201D to us. Things are getting worse\
  \ because Chinese has been known for their exclusivity in their social life--and\
  \ it\u2019s almost completely true, from my point of view. It\u2019s hard to avoid\
  \ the social stamp which has built for decades.\n\nHowever, I always believe that\
  \ Indonesia is the home of diversity, and thus, it would always be the truest home\
  \ for me. There\u2019s a bunch of lovely people that would surprise you and make\
  \ you decide to stay longer\u2014or even forever. You would find new friends from\
  \ various backgrounds and beliefs who will act SKSD-ly (\u201Csok kenal sok dekat\u201D\
  , a local term which means someone pretend like they are your close friends) to\
  \ make sure you don\u2019t feel lonesome. You would find merchants that collect\
  \ money for you to make sure you can return home safely. You would find complete\
  \ strangers on the street who will help you immediately and yet doesn\u2019t left\
  \ any name or address to allow you to say thank you. All these hospitability and\
  \ helping hands are pure, sudden, and unconditional\u2014regardless of your race\
  \ or your homeland. And travelling is one of the thing that makes me realized this\
  \ fact."
