Text: "There is a wonderful old Italian joke about a poor man who goes to church every\
  \ day and prays before the statue of a great saint, begging, \"Dear saint-please,\
  \ please, please...give me the grace to win the lottery.\" This lament goes on for\
  \ months. Finally the exasperated statue comes to life, looks down at the begging\
  \ man and says in weary disgust, \"My son, please, please, please...buy a ticket.\"\
  \ I bought mine and won one of the best adventures in Italy.\n\nTurin! What is behind\
  \ the scenes? Behind the best pizzas, the incredibly soft ice-creams, the priceless\
  \ fashion or all the strong coffees? There is also a Moroccan society! A society\
  \ which let me into their daily life and taught me one of the most important lessons\
  \ - we are all the same. I travelled there because of them, but I knew it will be\
  \ difficult to make a connection. I did not have any border and I was ready to step\
  \ out from my comfort zone. I started to practise how to live under Ramadan, how\
  \ to clean my body before I would go to the front of God, how to pray or how to\
  \ cook their traditional dishes. It was hard to wake up in the morning for language\
  \ courses, fast all day and also hard to change my habits and do not drink a glass\
  \ of wine every night. Was it worth it? That time I did not know. \n\nOne day they\
  \ organized a beautiful, amazing dinner close to their Mosque. It was incredible\
  \ to see how excited they were about us, no one has ever hosted me with this much\
  \ love. That night was the last drop, the top of the mountain. Not because of the\
  \ food or the weather. I caught a moment, you know, that memorable one, that you\
  \ never going to forget. I was sitting there in the grass and watched the children\
  \ playing football, they were happy, so happy without any judgement around them.\
  \ I felt the smell of couscous in the air and heard the laugh of the people.  We\
  \ were having dinner together on the floor under the sky and trust me it meant way\
  \ more than a night with full of alcohol. \n\nThe last day, we visited a big event\
  \ and prayed all together. I felt kind of sad, because I have already known that\
  \ the trip is almost over. Before we started to pray one of our host came to me\
  \ and offered me his traditional clothes. I accepted but I was speechless. He did\
  \ not say anything after all but I felt myself as a part of them, as a brother from\
  \ another culture. \n\nI still have that clothes in my closet, it symbolizes me\
  \ the memory of this adventure, but also the power of love and equality."
