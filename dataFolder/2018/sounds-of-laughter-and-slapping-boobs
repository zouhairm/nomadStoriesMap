Text: "Teaching in Colombia, language arts, to a bunch of junior highers is stressful.\
  \  It's not stressful in the sense of high workload or the rush of American business.\
  \  No, it's different.  The main stress was the cultural separation of planning\
  \ verses going with the flow.  Americans are not as good at going with the flow\
  \ as Colombians. \n\nColombians have a knack of finding the happiness and color\
  \ of life in everything they do.  They love dancing, socializing, partying (they\
  \ throw kick ass parties), and coloring.  I mean my kiddos loved, beyond anything\
  \ else in class, to color their folders and homework.  I would get super stressed\
  \ because I had this ridiculous expectation to teach American, you know, all test\
  \ resulted and developmentally on point.  Whatever that means.  I've since let go\
  \ of all of those philosophies.  Colombia definitely changed that.\n\nI met fellow\
  \ stressed educator, Madeline, at teacher lesson planning meeting.  Both of us looking\
  \ to get out of the city we had taken a trip to a hot spring in Santa Rosa.  We\
  \ hit it off and decided to take a longer trip together. \n\nOur chosen destination:\
  \ Termal San Vicente, located way up in the mountains.  It was about a 3 or 4 hour\
  \ bus ride from Pereira, where we both lived.  The bus stops at a local restaurant\
  \ along the way and you can order the special, aguapanela con queso.  It is this\
  \ delicious, fresh cheese seeped in sugar cane soup.  It sounds weird, but it is\
  \ totally awesome.\n\nThe road is bumpy and if you get car sick, well, good luck.\
  \  We stayed in a non-heated cabin.  Once you're in the hot springs you do not want\
  \ to leave because you freeze to death.  It's tranquil and surrounded by jungle.\
  \  We had a great first day relaxing in the springs, well almost relaxing.  Colombians\
  \ love listening to music at all times, so we didn't have total quiet.  \n\nWe signed\
  \ up for a massage. I am not sure if we accidentally signed up for a couples massage,\
  \ but we ended up being lead into an open room with two beds together.  Both looking\
  \ at each other and snickering, the ladies told us to undress.\n\nWe started normally.\
  \  At some point, the women told us to turn over, we complied.  We both held tightly\
  \ to our towels trying to keep the modesty.  As we relaxed, the towels were snatched\
  \ away leaving us completely exposed.  We both gasped and laughed.  Then it went\
  \ from weird funny to super awkward when the women started slapping our boobs! Laughter\
  \ and skin slapping filled the air.  \n\nA getaway of a lifetime."
