Text: "My heart is pounding in my chest.  Where is she?  She was here a second ago.\
  \  She was babbling away to the waitress in the highchair beside me, and now it's\
  \ empty! I stand up quickly and scan the room.  The glass of water in front of me\
  \ wobbles dangerously on it's bamboo coaster as my thighs bump the table.  I look\
  \ over at Jason.  He is attempting to convince our son that spring rolls are indeed\
  \ edible.  The people at the table next to us are deep in conversation.  Why aren\u2019\
  t they looking worried! \n\nThe glass teeters on the edge of its thick base.  I\
  \ reach out to grab it, and in one clumsy movement knock it over instead, spilling\
  \ water on the table.  Jason looks up at me with a bemused expression on his face.\
  \  The panic has now set in.  I open my mouth to yell, \"I think the waitress stole\
  \ our baby!\"\nIn that awkward position, half leaning over the table chair with\
  \ one arm outstretched in a failed attempt to catch the falling glass, I look up\
  \ and feel instant relief.\n\nI spot my 11 month old girl! She is sitting on the\
  \ waitresses lap in the corner, bashing the piano with her chubby fists in the way\
  \ that babies do.  She is less than 10 metres away and I suddenly feel extremely\
  \ embarrassed for over-reacting.\n\nShe looks over at me, smiles, and continues\
  \ her assault on the piano.  Nobody seems to mind the awful noise she is making.\
  \  Although this is the first time, it certainly isn\u2019t the last time a Vietnamese\
  \ waitress steals my baby.  It's not uncommon for Vietnamese people (especially\
  \ waitresses) to reach their arms out to a strangers child.  Children are not only\
  \ welcome here, but they are cherished.  If you were to stroll past a group of Vietnamese\
  \ women, it is unlikely you will make it past without at least one squeeze of baby\u2019\
  s chubby thighs.\n\nUpon reflection, it's these random social interactions that\
  \ make travelling with young kids worth the extra effort.  This child will not fear\
  \ or feel hate towards those that are different than us.  At this young age, she\
  \ has already experienced the fascination, wander and beauty of other cultures.\
  \ This child will have an open heart and an open mind.  The last thing I expected\
  \ was to feel gratitude for a mistaken kidnapping.\n\nMy advice, give in to the\
  \ welcoming nature of the Vietnamese people.  By the end of your travels through\
  \ Vietnam, this \u2018it takes a village\u2019 culture will have become a breath\
  \ of fresh air.  Beside, where else in the world will you receive such a warm welcome\
  \ in a fancy restaurant with young kids."
