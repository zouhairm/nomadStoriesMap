Text: "Resting on my armchair,\nHolding a coffee mug,\nThinking where this life would\
  \ end.\nThe sand dunes of Gujrat,\nThe desert spread to a miles\nDesert in your\
  \ hand ,time draws the lines.\nThere is still a desert in your heart\n\nThe city\
  \ of joy ,the city of hope. \nThe city of dreams,\nThe west is always all about\
  \ trends,fashion.\nThe name itself evolve from Bombay to Mumbai,\nWhere parties\
  \ doesn't care it's day or it's night.\nIt just need a reason.\nDancing in joy ,\
  \ dancing in hope\nIn the monsoon season.\n\nI remember when it first began,\nThe\
  \ place where every person is an artist,\nWhere everything you see is an art,\n\
  Where money is never a glittering star.\nWhere people try to find some time \nTo\
  \ write songs,poetry and rhymes.\nThe buildings of Kolkata still reflects you\n\
  The rich culture and the old tradition.\nIt's just like holding both the sunrise\
  \ and sunset,\nIt's just like the dawn\n\nThere is a place where there are people\n\
  Who are themselves.\nThey will be never be like you\nAnd if you be like them, \n\
  You change to be honest,\nYou change to be kind.\nThe city of temples, \nTemples\
  \ within their homes \nAnd temples within their hearts.\nThe people in Chennai do\
  \ have less emoticons \nBut full with emotions\nWhere people see your heart \nNot\
  \ your colour \nAnd they have a reason.\n\nAnd there are some fewer words for a\
  \ place with huge mountains.\nYou will see the beautiful creation of earth here,\n\
  You will never worry for your fears,dear.\nThe nights are beautiful,\nThe days are\
  \ best \nAnd with it's arms open \nThe mountains would always be calling.\n\nLet\
  \ my life leads me anywhere,\nFor anything.\nI will see the best everywhere\nAnd\
  \ in everything..."
