Text: "Stepping off the plane, you could already feel the heat and humidity through\
  \ the small gaps in the ramp walking into Changi airport.  Being from Canada where\
  \ it was still cold at that time of year, it was an unusual but wonderful feeling.\
  \  Changi airport was one of the nicest most decorated airports I have had the opportunity\
  \ to travel through, a welcoming area even before passing immigration, decorated\
  \ with a fountain and an indoor garden to be admired by any green thumb. \nAs I\
  \ met my contact she began to explain some of the \u201Crules\u201D of Singapore.\
  \  First off, no chewing gum getting caught with this would net you a fine of $1000\
  \ and god forbid you sell it, that could cost you up to $100,000 Singapore dollars.\
  \  Next, No Jaywalking, if caught you could be fine $20 on the spot or $1000 to\
  \ be paid at a later date; this could be accompanied by jail time.  Smoking (of\
  \ course) is only allowed in designated areas, of which there are not many, but\
  \ they are clearly marked.  Caught not flushing a public toilet $150, Caught spitting?\
  \ You\u2019ll be $1000 lighter.  The list goes on.  Some of the more unusual laws\
  \ include; flying a kite in a place that would interfere with traffic, annoying\
  \ someone with a musical instrument, and littering all of which will relieve you\
  \ of your hard-earned travel cash. \nDespite being inundated by rules and laws (Which\
  \ I definitely was not expecting) the streets, and pathways of this concrete jungle\
  \ were immaculately clean and the general overall feeling of the city is very safe.\
  \ Not once did I feel uneasy or as if I were in any danger, even while walking at\
  \ night.  You could walk miles through the city experiencing shopping malls, both\
  \ indoor and outdoor, the restaurants along Clark Quay offer any cuisine you desire.\
  \  Enjoy a river tour to enhance your experience and see the lights in the evening.\
  \  While wondering make your way to Garden by the bay to enthrall the botanist in\
  \ you, this offers open air and enclosed areas that have almost every plant you\
  \ could think of as well as an indoor waterfall. \nEnter Sentosa, this truly is\
  \ a tourist dreamland.  Here you could experience several themed areas that will\
  \ thrill, entertain and awe anyone looking to snap all the pictures you could ever\
  \ want.   It comes complete with Universal studios, a huge kid\u2019s playground,\
  \ casino, not to mention the Merlion (Singapore\u2019s most well-known fictional\
  \ character) this is a gigantic half lion half fish tower that has a view that takes\
  \ the breath away."
