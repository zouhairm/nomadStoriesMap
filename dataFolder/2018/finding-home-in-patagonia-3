Text: "I started questioning my decision within the first steps. My overstuffed backpack\
  \ felt awkward as I crawled along like a sad desert tortoise. I glanced over at\
  \ my sister and knew we were thinking the same thing- What the hell are we doing\
  \ here?  \n\nWe had decided to embark on the ultimate adventure- a backpacking trek\
  \ through southern Chilean Patagonia in Torres Del Paine. Did we have experience\
  \ backpacking? No. Were our bodies conditioned? Nope. But we threw caution to the\
  \ wind and booked our tickets. \n\nSeveral bumpy flights, a broken down bus , and\
  \ a peculiar night in a stranger\u2019s home later, we found ourselves spilling\
  \ out of a catamaran with a group of raggedy hikers as we took our first wobbly\
  \ steps. For the next three miles of our journey, my mantra became\u201C I hate\
  \ this\u201D. There we were - in a place I had dreamt of since childhood, and all\
  \ I could think about was how badly I wanted to quit. \n\nThose first days were\
  \ hellish. My mind wrestled with my body every step. It rained. My pack leaked,\
  \ resulting in restless nights spent in a soggy sleeping bag. My calves screamed\
  \ in spasming knots, and my sister felt feverish. The crew we arrived with had passed\
  \ us, leaving us alone in the wild. \n\nThen something happened.  By day 3 my mind\
  \ had quieted as we walked in silent communion, taking in the immense beauty all\
  \ around us. Each hour we came upon new wonders- fields of lupine, lush forests\
  \ of pine, ethereal snow capped mountains. Tumbling chunks of glacier rumbled in\
  \ the distance. The weather changed dramatically as if it were in a dimension of\
  \ it\u2019s own- rain and sun and clouds shifting like they were caught  in a time-lapse.\
  \ We drank straight out of streams, we peed behind trees with the most beautiful\
  \ views I had ever seen. We caught up with the other hikers and we beamed with pride.\
  \ That night everyone told stories around the campfire as we passed around a bottle\
  \ of something strong. My heart felt fuller than it had in a long time.\n\nThe days\
  \ to follow are hard to put into words. I began to experience self love like I had\
  \ never felt before. As I stood on the shore of Lago Nordenskjold , I looked over\
  \ at my sis and napping in the sun and knew this was where we were meant to be.\n\
  \n88 miles later, we hiked to the top of Mirador de Las Torres to catch our final\
  \ sunrise. As the light spilled across the monoliths, I felt immense gratitude -\
  \ for Patagonia -for this fiercely wild land that pushed me to the edge to show\
  \ me how beautiful the views were once I arrived."
