Text: "If someone told me six months ago that I would be back to the place I swear\
  \ I would not come back, I would have felt totally disappointment. In fact, this\
  \ is a story on how disappointing travel can be in some instances.\nSix months ago\
  \ I thought I was in the peak of my career. I was pursuing my Master\u2019s Degree\
  \ in Cultural Tourism in Spain, writing my Master Thesis, thinking that after I\
  \ defended that thesis I would be ready to rule the world. My blogging career was\
  \ also looking great. I was traveling on a regular basis, developing stories, collaborating\
  \ with sponsors. I thought nothing could go wrong. I was just expecting to be accepted\
  \ to start a PhD in that same university. \nOn September 7, 2017 everything started\
  \ to change. While presenting my thesis, back home in Puerto Rico my parents were\
  \ expecting Hurricane Irma. Luckily, Irma was not as bad as we though.\nA few days\
  \ later, things started to get messy. I decided to turn on that live from the National\
  \ Weather Bureau and there was another Category 5 Hurricane in the Caribbean: Hurricane\
  \ Maria. Maria hit the island on September 20. I could not speak to my family in\
  \ a week. I was not accepted on the PhD. It was time to go back home; even though\
  \ the country did not exist anymore the way I remembered it.\nAfter shipping all\
  \ my stuff and store everything in Orlando, I flew to Puerto Rico on November 20.\
  \ I really wanted to see my family but, on a very personal level, I was feeling\
  \ defeated. As the traveler I became and that person that flown away from home to\
  \ pursue a dream, going back that way felt like a loss.\nLiving for weeks with no\
  \ power, with limited Internet, with a broken computer (right in that moment when\
  \ my blogging career was going so well) felt like the biggest defeat of my life.\
  \ I did not even want to talk about travel. All that experience was traumatic and,\
  \ I suddenly realize that the image I had in my mind about traveling to do something\
  \ you\u2019re passionate for was completely broken. It took me two months to realize\
  \ that I am here for a reason, that not everything is lost.\nA couple of weeks ago\
  \ I found an article that described most of the things I have experienced in the\
  \ past couple of months. A Spanish psychologist defines most of the emotions I went\
  \ through as Migratory Grief. As travelers, we think we are totally used to transitions.\
  \ Sometimes, these experiences are the ones that make you realize that, even traveling\
  \ is a routine; we might not be prepared to deal with the unexpected."
