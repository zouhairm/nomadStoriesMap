Text: "As the train sped towards its final destination, my heart was beating in tandem\
  \ with the metal wheels clanging on the track. On my way back from a writer\u2019\
  s retreat in the Kumaon region, the only available train I got was reaching the\
  \ old Delhi station at 4 in the morning, allowing me to catch my 7am flight to Mumbai.\
  \ But also forcing me to venture out on the streets of Delhi in the middle of the\
  \ night.\nStories of rape and murder played on a loop in my mind, as I cursed myself\
  \ for tempting the fates like this.\n The wonderful, bustling, cultured city of\
  \ Delhi has a vibrant history going back several centuries.  Famous for its various\
  \ historic monuments, Bazaars and scrumptious street food, it is one of my favourite\
  \ cities and yet today Delhi seemed like a menacing monster, waiting to pounce upon\
  \ me. Don\u2019t get me wrong, lakhs of women work, travel, shop, party and go about\
  \ leading perfectly normal lives in this city. But often a heinous incident grabs\
  \ the headlines, and you are reminded of the depressing and shameful statistics\
  \ of the city\u2019s crime rate.\n  The train finally chugged into the station,\
  \ and I stepped out on the platform, quickly hailing a porter. Reaching the taxi\
  \ pick-up point, I paid the porter, expecting him to immediately scuttle off in\
  \ search of more passengers, but he didn\u2019t. \u201CSometimes these taxis cancel\
  \ at the last- minute madam, its better I wait with you.\u201D He said in reply\
  \ to my questioning glare.\nI thanked the porter as I settled into the taxi. Fingers\
  \ trembling, I quickly shared my ride details with my husband, and a local friend.\
  \ Silently praying for safe deliverance.  But as the station slowly disappeared\
  \ behind me, I decided to Refuse to give in to PARANOIA. With a calm voice I told\
  \ the driver, to follow GPS route, rolled the window down, and sat back to enjoy\
  \ my ride. Passing by majestic monuments standing in stoic silence, colonial buildings\
  \ bathed in moonlight and beautiful gardens silently waiting for the first kiss\
  \ of sunlight. As the taxi made its way across almost empty roads, Delhi revealed\
  \ its softer and charming side to me.\nAnd just like that, I reached the airport,\
  \ my driver quickly fetched a trolley and deposited my bag on it, refused to take\
  \ a tip, saying, \u201CIt is my duty to help you, just give me a good review.\u201D\
  \ He drove away as I stood gaping in shock. \nAs the cool air of the terminal hit\
  \ my face, a warm glow enveloped my heart. I had stepped out with trepidation into\
  \ darkness and found humanity, in the last place I expected to."
