Text: "Places like these are meant to stay Virgin and unexplored despite our coherent\
  \ environment .  The reason being, such bounties of nature are never brought to\
  \ limelight and hence remain undiscovered by many. For my travel appetite I fortunately\
  \  chanced upon this beauty of Tibetian Settlement in the state of Odisha.  Its\
  \ called Chandragiri or Phuntsokling by the Tibetian Refugees settled here.\n\n\
  Following the Chinese Invasion of Tibet in the year 1959, some of the Refugees started\
  \ residing here in Chandragiri among one of the many places in India.This Mini Tibet\
  \ as it's rightly called is around 90kms from a town Berhampur in Odisha. The way\
  \ to this place from Taptapani which is a hot springs in Odisha is remarkable. \
  \ The greenery all around and untaintedness in the air makes it the best oxygen\
  \ therapy that urban dwellers need.  Just when you start immigrating this beautiful\
  \  village the Tibetian  vibes can be felt.  The small huts, prayer flags, signs\
  \ of Tibetian culture will make u feel no less than being in some Hill Station in\
  \ the Himalayas. \n\nThe meandering roads, view of small hills at regular interval,\
  \ sprouting grass and greenery all rounds brings  liberation to the soul. The major\
  \ attraction of this place is the Padmasambhava Mahavihara Monastery which has big\
  \ prayer Hall with beautiful pictures about Buddhism all around.  The chantings\
  \ of the monks inside the prayer Hall made the whole atmosphere  very sacred. The\
  \ monastery has a school for Tibetian studies with students staying and studying\
  \ there. The well maintained  garden around the monastery and the positive vibes\
  \ just made me think that this place has all the components of a perfect travellers\
  \ abode but is buried in the interiors of our country. \n\nSitting on one of the\
  \ bench with the prayers flags all around, I felt despite having spent so many years\
  \ of my life in this beautiful state,  I still was unaware of this beauty. Nature\
  \ is the best teacher and this time also it did not fail to surprise me with its\
  \ learning. We tend to underestimate the things near by or within us.\n\nMy key\
  \ take aways from this small yet meaning trip to chandragiri is that how we fail\
  \ to discover our own worth due to self doubt and keep longing for our own peace\
  \ and happiness in others. Despite being so close to this place I never expected\
  \ this to be a piece of such sheer beauty.\n\nSo keep continuing your journeys but\
  \ now with a little more love and confidence for the most important person in your\
  \ life which is YOU."
