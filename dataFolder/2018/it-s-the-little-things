Text: "The desire to see the world drives so many of us to go to new places and experience\
  \ new cultures.  Often times, the decision to travel to a certain destination is\
  \ triggered by the fascination of taking in one specific sight. Maybe it's the incredible\
  \ temples of Angkor Wat, the ancient ruins of Machu Picchu, or just the lush rainforests\
  \ of Costa Rica, these are the things that bring us to that specific place at that\
  \ time.\n\nTo me, though, it's always the little things that make me fall in love\
  \ with a locale.  Those great stories of minor culture shock that seem like trivial\
  \ things at the time, but eventually become your favorite anecdote to relive.  One\
  \ of my most beloved experiences to recite is the time I bought a \"bag of coke\"\
  \ at a roadside stand in Costa Rica.\n\nNow, this isn't a \"frat boy in Medellin\
  \ with fantasies of Pablo Escobar\" story.   Not at all. It's far more trivial (and\
  \ legal).   \n\nI had been out for a day of hiking in beautiful Rincon de la Vieja\
  \ National Park in northern Costa Rica.  During the return trip to my hotel that\
  \ afternoon, I had run out of water.  I decided to pull over to a small roadside\
  \ store to grab a drink.  Very small and a bit rough, it was manned by a middle\
  \ aged woman who spoke strictly Spanish.  I noticed they seemed to be out of water,\
  \ and desperate for something to quench my thirst, I decided to ask for a \"Coke,\
  \ por favor\" (thus exhausting the extent of my Spanish speaking skills.)\n\nThe\
  \ woman removes one of the bottles from the single cooler.  At the counter, she\
  \ opens it for me (which I appreciate since I don't have a bottle cap remover handy)\
  \ and then produces a small clear plastic grocery bag.  At this point, I'm slightly\
  \ confused.  I really don't require a bag for a single bottle of soda.  To my total\
  \ surprise, she then dumps the entire bottle directly into this bag.  She ties the\
  \ top closed and sticks a straw through the side like I would have done with those\
  \ plastic bags of \"juice\" I had in my lunch as a child.   \n\nIt seems I had underestimated\
  \ the value of the bottle deposit in Costa Rica.  \n\nI returned to the car where\
  \ my partner was waiting for me, with a look she could only describe later as \"\
  completely dumbfounded\".   She asked what had happened, and the only thing I could\
  \ say was \"I think I just bought a bag of coke. We better get out of here. \"\n\
  \nTo this day it's those little things that happen that truly make me excited to\
  \ explore somewhere I've never been before."
