Text: "This kitchen with old-looking green tiles had no charm. It will be, however,\
  \ a central point in my Colombian experience.\n\nMy room was on the second floor\
  \ so I had to cross the kitchen on the first floor in order get to it, then again\
  \ to exit the flat. \nAt first, I remember going down the stairs, and would get\
  \ scare at seeing Mariela, the owner.\nI was scared of not being understood when\
  \ speaking Spanish. She spoke no English.\n\nSo, I would see Mariela, smile, and\
  \ say \"Hola\" softly, and she would answer me with a big \"HOLA, Como estas?\"\
  , (Hello, how are you?). \nIn the morning she asked me how I slept, and at night,\
  \ how was my day. \nI was uncomfortable at first with these small-talks, but as\
  \ I grew accustomed to them, I started enjoying them, and even looking forward to\
  \ them.\nI practiced my Spanish and learned how to express simple thoughts and emotions.\n\
  \nShe especially helped me, the way a mother would, with an important topic for\
  \ a young man, girls. \n\nI took advantage of being in Colombia to took Salsa classes.\
  \ During one lesson, I noticed that a girl was looking at me intensely and when\
  \ the teacher told us to switch partners, I went to dance with her. Our moves were\
  \ coordinated, and our hands couldn\u2019t leave each other. So when the teacher\
  \ said \xAB Switch \xBB, we stayed together. She laughed. I was mesmerized by our\
  \ synergy and, I fell deeply in love.\n\nI can tell you that Mariela was worried.\
  \ She was looking at me, nodding her head in disapproval as I must have been looking\
  \ like a mad romantic. I remember having a big smile and my eyes were wide open\
  \ and dreamy.\nMariela wanted to protect me, but she also trusted me. I felt that\
  \ she really cared because she regularly asked me about my relationships with friends\
  \ and especially ladies. \nFinally, after four months in Bogota, my journey was\
  \ coming to an end. For the last two weeks, Mariela had been counting the days left\
  \ before my flight back home. She was telling me everyday that I will be missed,\
  \ and that I shall not forget them. In the last week, she offered me Colombian souvenirs.\
  \ I had a traditional Colombian bag and a wallet. She invited me for lunch and we\
  \ said our goodbyes. That\u2019s when I realized that a mother needed not be of\
  \ my own blood to be a mother, she just needed to care, and I simply needed to be\
  \ open to making a local connection."
