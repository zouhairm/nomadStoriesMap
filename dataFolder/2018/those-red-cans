Text: "Barcelona, Spain. 19th May 2013, 11:35 p.m.\n\nWe should be home, in Italy,\
  \ now. We had the return flight at 10:20 a.m. this morning. But here we are, sitting\
  \ at the foot of one of the many old doors that you can find in the alleys of El\
  \ Raval. Those alleys where you can get lost in a moment and, in a while, find yourself\
  \ in the spacious Rambla. Those alleys sometimes noisy and crowded and sometimes\
  \ frighteningly dark and silent. That's not the case. We are sitting here, me and\
  \ Carla, my college mate, my \u201Csinging on the beach waiting for the dawn\u201D\
  \ mate, and we are just some voices among many others.\n\u201CPerdida en el coraz\xF3\
  n de la grande Barcelon, me dicen el clandestino por no llevar papel\u201D we hum\
  \ in unison, appropriately changing Manu Chao\u2019s lyrics, her head on my shoulder.\
  \ The journey was supposed to end hours ago...\nA very young Pakistani approaches\
  \ offering us a beer. Yes, the usual Spanish red can with the star. It is the third\
  \ time since we are here (just 3 days!) that someone sits near us, chat a bit, offers\
  \ us a beer and then leaves. They taught me not to accept candy from strangers.\
  \ Nobody ever told me \"do not accept beers in sealed cans from strangers.\" So\
  \ yes, we gladly accept, dude!\n\u201C\xBFQuieres comer? \xBFQuieres caf\xE9? \xA1\
  Tranquila!\u201D he kept saying in a broken Spanish. After a few minutes we can\
  \ figure out that: his name is Amir; his brother's girlfriend is Catalan and can\
  \ help us; beer is good - \xA1Tranquila! - it's just a cover-up activity!\nNa\xEF\
  ve girls.\nWhy are we following Amir? Probably because as we were told by a friend\
  \ \u201CIf you are together nothing bad can happen to you.\u201D We are following\
  \ Amir because he has honest eyes, and even if \u201C\xBFQuieres comer? \xBFQuieres\
  \ caf\xE9?\u201D were the only things he could tell us...even those were genuine\
  \ concerns. We follow him to the majestic Plaza Catalunya and here we find Mireia.\
  \ Here, in an unknown place among unknown people, we were surprised by Mireia's\
  \ almost immediate invitation:\n\"You can sleep at my house as much as you want,\
  \ we'll just be a little tight!\"\nEvidently, she trusts Amir's deep eyes, too.\n\
  Four floors strictly without elevator, like every typical respectable palace of\
  \ El Raval. Welcoming us were Amir\u2019s 6 brothers, a red sofa bed tidied up for\
  \ us, the TV turned on a colourful bollywood movie, a late dinner with a tender\
  \ and spicy stew accompanied by the stories of their lives and their hopes of finding\
  \ a steady, honest job.\nOn the table, the inevitable red cans with the star.\n\n\
  The real journey starts now."
