Text: "There was a time when visiting church was just for a purpose of expediency.\
  \ Attending mass and family prayer in the evening was a custom, which I had to follow\
  \ due to the family imposition that continued since childhood. Steadily, I started\
  \ believing.\nA small dinner discussion led to the planning of a trip to Velankanni.\
  \ One of the most sacred Christian pilgrimage places located on the sea shore of\
  \ Bay of Bengal. A town, famous for the Shrine Basilica dedicated to lady of health\
  \ which was also declared as a holy city by the POPE. A beautiful place enriched\
  \ with peace.\nVelankanni changed my way of thinking towards my set of beliefs,\
  \ trust and worship, leaving me questioning.\n  I never knew that a small family\
  \ trip impact would be so deep. A small unwilling decision would hit me to the core\
  \ and push me to the start.\nIn our busy life schedules, we visit our deities according\
  \ to our availability. We worship according to our convenience. But the world doesn\u2019\
  t end on us.\nWhen I entered that holy place, grace just touched me and goose bumps\
  \ showed it presence. It was full of wholehearted people always ready to help. \
  \ More importantly, I saw the manner in which several devotees walk on their knees\
  \ on a hard, hot sand path for almost 1500 mtrs (roughly 1 and a half kilometers)\
  \ in penance. Whereas I was wearing shades and was afraid to get tanned, they were\
  \ confident of their trust that was blessed by our lady of health. It is not a mandate\
  \ protocol over there but still many of the devotees follow that and even the children.\n\
  \ As I comprehended, I realized that why I didn\u2019t try that. Have I never sinned,\
  \ for which I don\u2019t need to do penance? No! We all do that being humans. It\
  \ was my self-esteem that constrained me to do that.  It was their belief that strengthened\
  \ them mentally (with patience and peace) and physically. We don\u2019t need to\
  \ show our status and ego when it comes to Lord. Because god doesn\u2019t help us\
  \ or see us by our high status or so. God judges us by our heart and by our action.\
  \ What is that pride that stops you from worshipping your Lord. The one who gave\
  \ everything that we are busy to sustain and expand, \u201Cultimate giver\u201D\
  .  There should not be even 1 % doubt in your faith. Appropriate statement for that\
  \ is - Sometimes money can\u2019t buy you everything. The road of pride is usually\
  \ ."
