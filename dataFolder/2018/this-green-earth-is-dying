Text: "Paul is a Galway local. He stands underneath the shadows of the banners bearing\
  \ the crests of the houses of Ireland and sighs about poetry being dead. In the\
  \ same breath he swears by the existence of the ancient ancestors of the Emerald\
  \ Isle. In Ireland, poetry and myth are intertwined with agriculture. It rains 300\
  \ days of the year here and everywhere one sees abundant grasslands and flora from\
  \ all corners of the Earth. Brought over after the Ice Age through land bridges\
  \ that no longer exist, the survival of the huge variance of plant life has been\
  \ dependent upon Ireland\u2019s relative geographic isolation. \u201CIt has snowed\
  \ once in my lifetime.\u201D Paul says. \u201CBut that is changing now. The rising\
  \ sea levels are eroding our coasts. This place of magic you see today may no longer\
  \ exist in the near future.\u201D \n\nPaul the tour guide becomes Paul the bus driver\
  \ becomes Paul the storyteller and the feeling in the air is the same as that of\
  \ a transcontinental family road trip. And such stories does he tell us, such stories!\
  \ First, of the origins of Ireland and of the faerie folk whom he aptly compares\
  \ to the\nelves in Lord of the Rings. He says, \u201CThey seemed to us quite immortal,\
  \ but that was only because they lived for so long.\u201D He says, \u201CThey were\
  \ the first people of Ireland and they cultivated the land under the principle that\
  \ they were borrowing the land from their children. And when they heard of menfolk\
  \ coming from the European lands, they shrouded Ireland in a mist so thick it left\
  \ many invaders stranded in the violent seas. But menfolk are ferocious creatures,\
  \ greedy by their nature. Eventually they found Ireland after all.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ war ended with a truce\u2014the menfolk would take the Aboveworld and the faerie\
  \ the Underworld. Many Irish men and women still believe that the faerie roam among\
  \ them, that they leave the Underworld from time to time to make certain that the\
  \ menfolk to which they gave the Aboveworld have not abused the land that was gifted\
  \ to them, the land that remains today as some of the most anomalous, most fertile,\
  \ most green land on this Earth. And so, says Paul, \u201CIf you encounter someone\
  \ strange, someone just a bit off, someone with a shimmer in their eye, they might\
  \ just be one of the faerie.\u201D\n\nI settle into a craig in the Cliffs of Moher.\
  \ Even from 800 feet above the ocean, I can see the violent waves battering at the\
  \ rockface. I can see the stone crumbling apart, borne back into the froth. \"I'm\
  \ tired,\" says Paul. \"It's up to your generation now.\""
