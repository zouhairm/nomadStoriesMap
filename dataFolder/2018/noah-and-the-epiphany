Text: "It was November time - rainy season in Uganda. I\u2019d been in the country\
  \ since September as a volunteer in Nakigo, Iganga. Iganga was like an intuitive\
  \ oil painting, coloured wildly almost entirely by masses of orange and green, from\
  \ dusty potholed roads and flourished trees. One night I walked along that dusty\
  \ road to home, shielding my face when bodas sped by, when I heard a woman\u2019\
  s voice shout \u2018Muzungu! Muzungu, come here\u2019. She waved me over from her\
  \ wooden stool, curled over stirring something in a pot on the open fire outside\
  \ her home.\n\nHer name was Vivian. \u2018This is posho\u2019 she told me pointing\
  \ at the mixture inside the pot that looked similar to porridge \u2018it\u2019s\
  \ mill flour and water, it\u2019s what we eat here in Uganda\u2019. She used a spoon\
  \ that\u2019s called a mingling stick to fold the contents over. I asked to try\
  \ making it, she smiled widely and guided me to the stool. Her family joined us,\
  \ the five children and her husband Noah. With the language barrier between us we\
  \ kept conversation simple. Her kids asked me about foods and clothes in England,\
  \ her husband about agriculture which is big in Uganda, then Vivian said \u2018\
  Ugandans are very religious. People are either Muslim or Christian. Which are you?\u2019\
  . I revealed that I had no religious beliefs, that I was taught them as a child,\
  \ but it had been ten years since i\u2019d been to church. \u2018Tomorrow you join\
  \ us at church\u2019 Noah told me enthusiastically and I promised I would. \n\n\
  The next morning we walked together for twenty minutes in astounding heat. We passed\
  \ the chapati stalls, talking to each other in the spaces between greeting village\
  \ people. Vivian mentioned that this was a born again Christian church. We arrived\
  \ to what looked like an ordinary house on the outside. Inside, however, it was\
  \ lined with strings of flags, had decorated stands for preaching, and around fifty\
  \ plastic chairs squashed together. I sit beside Noah.\n\nWhen the service began\
  \ Noah worked fast to translate what the preachers said and what the choir songs\
  \ were when we all stood to clap along. \u2018You understand?\u2019 he checked,\
  \ hopeful. In that church it dawned on me how accepting it felt to receive that\
  \ rare, wholesome kindness from strangers. When they had little, but gave wholly\
  \ to help me without asking for anything in return. Instead of the religious conversion\
  \ they wanted me to have, they helped me gain something more important, a faith\
  \ that the spirit and actions of people could be good, even in the most unexpected\
  \ times."
