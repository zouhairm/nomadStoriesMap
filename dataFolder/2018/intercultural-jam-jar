Text: "Among my travel jam jar moments, the following is a culinary highlight. I conserved\
  \ it as accurately as possible in the chaotic kitchen of my memory. Whenever the\
  \ country that should feel like home, doesn't feel like home, I open that jam jar,\
  \ smell its inside and can't help smiling.\n Two girls are lying side by side on\
  \ the bare ground in front of the kitchen of a convent in Offinso, Ghana. Sometimes\
  \ they are talking and sometimes they remain silent. Nothing spectacular. But this\
  \ moment is not about its outer appearance at all.\nIt's that time of the day, when\
  \ the earth under our bodies is still warmed up by the sun. As soon as the temperature\
  \ is becoming bearable, the mosquitos attack. We have finished cooking Fufu for\
  \ the nuns and the smell of campfire is still lingering in the air. By looking at\
  \ the pawpaw trees next to us I can guess what we will have for breakfast tomorrow.\
  \ Joana has laid down next to me silently. She's wearing her red dress, as she does\
  \ six days a week. Lying on her back, one hand is resting on her belly the other\
  \ one under her head. While her facial expression is more relaxed than during the\
  \ day, it is not as relaxed as the face of a 14-year-old girl should be. \"Can your\
  \ doctors make my skin-color as light as yours?\" I am turning on my side to see\
  \ her face, which appears slightly silhouetted against the increasing darkness.\
  \ I am taking in the contour of the tribal marks on her cheek. \"Joana, what do\
  \ you think life in Germany is like?\" \"Like heaven on earth\", she replies. I\
  \ wish to point out that Ghanaians are genuinely warm-hearted. A friendly greeting\
  \ by the fruit seller or the cheerful nature of my favorite tailor can make my day.\
  \ But conversations with locals turn magical when the questions can't be answered\
  \ by Google or polite small talk.\nSo just then, despite the tragical dimension\
  \ of Joana's question, I felt euphoria crawling up my spine. When it comes to cross-cultural\
  \ sensitization, active reflection and long pauses are key. Pauses not as silence\
  \ of thoughts, but as silence for thinking. We talked about Joana\u2018s mother\
  \ who had died during childbirth. We talked about why she deems my skin more beautiful,\
  \ and the damn mosquitos. We talked until this crazy rooster without any sense of\
  \ time crowed for the first time at 3 am. The sky had started to become brighter\
  \ and brighter and so had we.\nImpossible to recreate the taste of every single\
  \ ingredient that made this night so special, but I would kill for the recipe."
