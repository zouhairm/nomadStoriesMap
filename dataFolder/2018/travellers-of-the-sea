Text: "The last thing I expected was to see her straight away. Stepping onto the beach\
  \ with no torch meant I had only the eerie glow on the clouds above the Bargara\
  \ township to see the beautiful east coast Australian beach of Mon Repos by. Other\
  \ than the clouds and the sea, the beach was coal black. Until my eyes adjusted.\
  \ And to my joy, I saw a huge sea turtle on the beach for the first time. There\
  \ she was. Her prehistoric features and huge carapace were a bewitching contrast\
  \ to her soulful liquid eyes. Such a big powerful creature, yet so vulnerable on\
  \ land. And yet still she came. \n\nAfter at least 29 years of swimming through\
  \ the vast Pacific Ocean over to South America and back again, female Loggerhead\
  \ turtles inch their way up this sandy Australian beach to lay over a hundred gooey\
  \ white, golf ball sized eggs into a deep hole they carefully carve out of the sand.\
  \ I had come not so far, only from New Zealand, nor had I any eggs to lay and I\
  \ had flown across rather than swam through the ocean to Australia as the turtles\
  \ had. I had thought if I just saw just one sea turtle during my week of volunteering,\
  \ then the trip will be worthwhile. I had no idea I\u2019d be seeing maybe ten in\
  \ a night. I was completely blown away.\n\nAll due to the amazing opportunity to\
  \ stay at the Mon Repos Turtle center which works to advocate and inform turtle\
  \ conservation. Part of saving many critically endangered species is educating and\
  \ engaging people in how awe-inspiring these animals are. How they are part of the\
  \ complex circle of life we all love to learn about, wonder at and explore. The\
  \ center has for 50 years been collecting data on these amazing creatures helping\
  \ to drive informed decision making regarding species conservation. Because turtles\
  \ are naturally long-lived, slow to reach sexual maturity and breed infrequently,\
  \ conservation of these species is amazingly complex and fragile, and there is surprisingly\
  \ little known about these iconic species outside the work of dedicated researchers.\
  \ At Mon Repos the ecotourism aspect of visiting the beach brings income to the\
  \ region, allows for funding to help the species awareness, and helps groups of\
  \ awed tourists see sea turtles without disturbing them from their epic egg laying.\n\
  \nBy day this stunning Queensland beach is full of families and tourists alike enjoying\
  \ its white sand beauty and clear blue waters. But at night it is a quiet haven\
  \ where slow-moving rocks inch their way up the beach to start the next generation."
