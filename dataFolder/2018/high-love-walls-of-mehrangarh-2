Text: "Walking like three musketeers upon the stone lane. The Elongated scented tuberose\
  \ Spikes along the path signifying the Soared fort.\n\u201CMy name is Zameer ! and\
  \ I am Pak-Afghan Refugee working as a local Guide over here\u201D, The boy introduced\
  \ himself. Khushal face falls prey to appall, just like all the smell of flowers\
  \ and the taste of snack has been ruined.\nIt was like, the thinking of the two\
  \ opposite end of magnets clarifying nation bonds may have raised up!. Zameer must\
  \ be pretending the situations undergoing at the borders, and enjoying his life\
  \ by saying confidently about his antecedent country.My curiosity grew up,\n\u201C\
  Zameer, How did you come over here?\nHe smiles back at me, saying\n\u201CSir, just\
  \ before 16 years we immigrate India as refugee!\u201D.\nJust one thing gets cleared\
  \ that he was not a guy who spend his infancy here about royal stay but, his next\
  \ statement shock me anyway,\n \u201CThis tour guide business has worked wonders\
  \ for me. It not only helps me to be financially independent but it also is therapeutic.\
  \ Especially for people like us who escaped war \u2026 this venture is also acting\
  \ as a stress-buster and is building our self-esteem,\u201D says Zameer, who came\
  \ to India from Herat - Afghanistan\u2019s third largest city - with his four elder\
  \ siblings and beloved mother in 2000, and now manages to pay rent and school fees.\n\
  \u201Cthanks to the venture that just a 5 year ago UN refugee agency registered\
  \ my family and we can live freely in this democratic country.\u201D\n Khushal gives\
  \ a vindicated Smile. \n\u201Cand Still you have caught up the local taste ?\u201D\
  .\nZeeshan nodded with gracefully may be thinking that Khushal is clear about \u201C\
  It\u2019s much better than medicine.\u201D\nWe came across Fort rooms and Museum\
  \ which were Burnished in red sandstone, imposing, invincible and yet with a strange\
  \ haunting beauty that beckons.\n\u201CRudyard Kipling called it 'the work of giants'.\
  \ Today, it is acknowledged as the best-preserved fort in India\u201D.\nZeeshan\
  \ completed his last words impressively which quench our thirst to explore Mehrangarh.\n\
  \ An immediate appearance of  Zeeshan with those pairs of puppet was his Talisman\
  \ Elated us,\n\u201CSir, here is your special ones!\u201D.\nAs lagniappe, he gives\
  \ us decorative Kathputli puppets.\nHolding the threads of puppets. We both waved\
  \ him keeping mum walking on the same stone lane.\ndownwards to the blue city back\
  \ but, where all the flowers Go?"
