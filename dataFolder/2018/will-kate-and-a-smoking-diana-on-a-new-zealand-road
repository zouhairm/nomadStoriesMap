Text: "Breaking down in the middle of nowhere, with no phone signal and my first-ever\
  \ car, Diana, smoking dramatically like the preamble to a movie-like explosion,\
  \ was not how I expected to start my first road trip - and I certainly didn\u2019\
  t expect the wonderful people it\u2019d bring into my life.\n\nI\u2019d arrived\
  \ in New Zealand several months before, but spent my time apple-picking to save\
  \ funds to explore. Finally, with my friend Lisi in the driving seat, I was on my\
  \ way! And what a start: beautiful blue skies gave lie to Maori word for New Zealand,\
  \ Aotearoa, meaning \u201CLand of the Long White Cloud\u201D. The lush forestry\
  \ surrounding the winding roads of the North Island made it all too easy to imagine\
  \ we had travelled back in time and would see a Brachiosaurus any second. For a\
  \ moment, I was completely, perfectly content...\n\nThat\u2019s when Diana began\
  \ to struggle. Just a sputter at first, barely heard over \u201CBittersweet Symphony\u201D\
  \ playing (rather appropriately) over the stereo. Then Lisi turned to me in a panic:\
  \ \u201CMy foot is on the gas...but the car isn\u2019t going.\u201D We pulled over\
  \ and tried (and failed) to remain calm while we waited for a car to pass. And waited...and\
  \ waited. Just as we started to feel, well, royally screwed, who comes along but\
  \ Will and Kate? Okay, no, not THAT Will and Kate, but instead an elderly Kiwi couple\
  \ who brought us, two strangers, back to their home for tea and cake - they even\
  \ organised to have a mechanic fetch Diana.\n\nWhen it turned out that the car was\
  \ beyond repair, Will asked us what we wanted to do. Agonizing for a moment, I realised\
  \ I\u2019d have to dip into my already precariously low travel funds to buy a new\
  \ car. What happened next caused my jaw to hit the floor (figuratively, of course,\
  \ otherwise I\u2019d have had bigger problems). Will and Kate spoke silently to\
  \ one another, like only couples who\u2019ve been married for 30-odd years can do,\
  \ and... \u201CWell, you can take our car.\u201D\n\nHow had I had gone from crying\
  \ with frustration over 10,000 miles from home, to crying with gratitude while hugging\
  \ the most generous retired Kiwi couple ever, all within a couple of hours? After\
  \ I stuttered \u201CAre you sure?\u201D and \u201CThank you!\u201D on repeat for\
  \ half an hour, it was settled; I would borrow their spare car for the three weeks\
  \ it would take to do the road-trip - at their insistence!\n\nI\u2019d heard about\
  \ the generosity of strangers, but the kindness and trust Will and Kate showed me\
  \ that day was beyond anything I\u2019d ever experienced - and has earned them a\
  \ special place in my heart."
