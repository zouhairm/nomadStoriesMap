Text: "Isn\u2019t it always the way \u2013 you plan a trip to the n-th degree but\
  \ it\u2019s always the UNplanned moments that are truly unforgettable?\nI had researched\
  \ the \u2018must see\u2019 sights of Namibia to death. Our route was mapped out,\
  \ accommodation sorted and vehicle hired. We found the spectacular deserts, canyons\
  \ and coast were a living, breathing David Attenborough series. Zebra, wildebeest,\
  \ elephants and giraffes wandered in their droves across the plains (and roads)\
  \ and rhino and lion appeared, as if on cue, at floodlit waterholes. \nNambwa, the\
  \ final camp of our journey, was tucked away on the edge of a vast floodplain. We\
  \ bumped and rolled along 14kms of deep, sandy track to reach our site on the banks\
  \ of a narrow river. As we watched yet another stunning sunset, glass of wine in\
  \ hand, I patted myself on the back for the outstanding job I\u2019d done organising\
  \ this remarkable trip. As the sun dipped, the river sparkled like pink champagne\
  \ and, naturally, up came a glowing full moon.\nWe climbed into our rooftop tent\
  \ as happy as warthogs.\nAs I started to drift off I was suddenly jolted awake with\
  \ the sound of branches snapping close by. I prodded my snoring husband beside me\
  \ and held my fingers to my lips. We turned to press our faces against the screen\
  \ doorway and gazed wide-eyed into the half light. More snapping, followed by a\
  \ throaty rumble, a heavy exhale and a faint shuffling of feet. \nOut of the darkness,\
  \ not 30cm from my face, the side of an enormous head appeared with ears flapping\
  \ softly. A deeply wrinkled, glistening eye peered into our tent. We sat rigid.\
  \ I held my breath. Suddenly our canvas walls felt very flimsy. As the silhouette\
  \ of the elephant\u2019s body passed by I could have run my hand over her rounded\
  \ back. Surely she could hear my heart thumping. She lifted her trunk and made a\
  \ snuffling noise, gently encouraging a youngster along in front of her. Behind\
  \ her another elephant followed, its stark tusks illuminated in the moonlight. As\
  \ this giant padded past I wondered if that earthy odour was its dusty skin or my\
  \ profuse sweating.\nFeeling rattles and bumps on each side of the vehicle I realised\
  \ there were now six curious elephants investigating our campsite.\nEventually their\
  \ huge rear ends disappeared into the adjacent bush and their soft rumblings dissipated\
  \ into the night. We sat speechless for several minutes until I could finally let\
  \ my breath go. \nUnfortunately I could not take the credit for this extraordinary,\
  \ unexpected, unforgettable moment."
