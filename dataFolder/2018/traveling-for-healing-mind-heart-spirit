Text: "This is the Gabelle's story\n\nWell, some day i woke up and i had a bad day,\
  \ then i thought that maybe to heal all the pain in my heart and that help me with\
  \ my thoughts and clean my spirit, i have to travel more. I didnt have the money\
  \ but i had the opportunity and won a dream trip. So, is that the way how i started\
  \ making plans without to much thinking, and just did it. And when a met all this\
  \ beautiful and magic place i felt my heart, my soul and my spirit healed a little\
  \ bit, so i have to travel and travel until my life turns into a healthy way living\
  \ and heal piece by piece in every single magic place i know. \n\nI knew that i\
  \ loved to be alone and in every city spend time looking for people as weird as\
  \ me, and have some fun, and exchange experiences that bring us to life again and\
  \ again.\n\nWake up every morning looking around and see the clear or cloudy sky,\
  \ smell the smells of each day and each town. Take a cup of tea \nwhile you philosophize\
  \ about life and lot of stuff. \n\nOn this trip to Argentina I realized that walking\
  \ through its streets was to be in another world. And to meet \nso many different\
  \ people who have traveled around the world as you dream to do it some day.\n\n\
  Its streets, its facades, its architecture, its colors, its food, its people, and\
  \ its culture have been a wonderful experience for me. I carry all the memories\
  \ in my mind but above all in my heart, photographs of where they will never be\
  \ erased, will never be lost because they will be forever with me inside of me in\
  \ a treasure that I have kept in my whole being.\n\nAnd this is how another trip\
  \ ended in this wonderful country is how a story culminated where I have been able\
  \ to treasure many memories And also many that will serve me to remember how they\
  \ made me evolve in my body, soul  and spirit.\n\nIt's the last day and I took the\
  \ opportunity to go out to a caf\xE9 and have a drink with myself. I could also\
  \ philosophize about all this new experience and be able to take my friends some\
  \ souvenirs from this place that has left me so much in my heart.\n\nI will leave\
  \ a list of the places I have visited of its interesting museums and cultural places\
  \ where I learned a lot from its history and about its culture. I also recommend\
  \ that in every trip you undertake you do without prejudice of people and without\
  \ missing the opportunity to live each day as if it were the last of your life I\
  \ also recommend that you be an open-minded person and that each of your new experiences\
  \ so you can live it full of love."
