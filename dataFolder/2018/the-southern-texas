Text: "The southern Texas\n\nThe last thing I expected by arriving to Texas is to\
  \ feel like, I have arrived home and that on the end of my trip I will apply for\
  \ University there. \nI am hungarian, but somehow I never felt like home about my\
  \ country. I lived in London for 12 years now, but this city still didn\u2019t make\
  \ me feel like home. But when I arrived to Texas, it really stolen my heart. When\
  \ I first landed, I knew, this is the place what I could call home. I don\u2019\
  t know what was it exactly.  Maybe the vibe or the atmosphere of Texas or maybe\
  \ the hospitable people there. Oh, and the southern accent, which is like music\
  \ to my ears. Not to mention country music.\nSo while in Texas I decided to go to\
  \ the rodeo at Mesquite. I was so excited. I always wanted to see one. When I got\
  \ there, it was inside a big arena, which was covered. When I got inside there were\
  \ lot of bulls in a cage waiting for their turns. I found my seat, then I saw the\
  \ cowboys catching the bulls with the lasso. After that the clown started to entertain\
  \ the audition. They had this attraction in every break, which was a surprise for\
  \ me. Later I saw the shark cage coming up with people inside the ring. That was\
  \ for the bull riding. You could see the fear and the excitement on the cowboys\u2019\
  s faces. It was an incredible experience. \nSo on that night I went to try it out\
  \ in a pub on a bull machine. Oh my god, it was so much fun. Although the guy, who\
  \ controlled the machine went really easy on me, but even with easy speed, it was\
  \ really hard to hold myself on it. I realised, it\u2019s a really hard job. Can\
  \ you imagine how strong you have to be to hold yourself even just for 3 seconds?\
  \ \nSo if you ever go to Texas, don\u2019t forget to visit a rodeo. It\u2019s really\
  \ fun. And if you want to try the bull-machine in Dallas, you can go to this place\
  \ called Trophy room on McKinney Avenue. You can party there and have fun on the\
  \ bull at the same time. The music is really good. RnB and pop music. Really cool\
  \ place.\nI had an amazing time with Texan people and also with my friend. I love\
  \ Texan people and Texas itself. It really made me think to spend more time here.\
  \ So on the last day I have visited the University of Texas at Tyler. I thought,\
  \ that maybe I should make my dream come true here in Tyler, which is to be a tv\
  \ presenter. So I\u2019ve decided to apply for communication in media course. And\
  \ I\u2019ve got in. Yaaay!!! Probably I will start in August. I can\u2019t wait\
  \ to have more adventures in Texas. You never know what happens next."
