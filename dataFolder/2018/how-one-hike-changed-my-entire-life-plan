Text: "Isaiah and I drove along a dirt road up Blackhead Peak outside of Pagosa Springs,\
  \ CO. The road was winding, but Isaiah took the curves with grace. Tall aspens hid\
  \ the view, but breaks in the trees revealed our ascent.\n\nWhen we reached the\
  \ end of the road, we started hiking. I was a fat kid when I was young. Even though\
  \ I lost weight, inadequacy stuck with me. I worry about keeping up. I definitely\
  \ never climbed a mountain before, like Isaiah and I intend to do today.\n\nAs we\
  \ kept hiking, I started getting caught up in the beauty around us. The mountain\
  \ called out the photographer in me. I shot everything: the sea of yellow flowers\
  \ on the hill; a white snail shell, vibrant amongst the greenery.\n\nAfter a while,\
  \ the trail turned away from the peak, so we left the path. We had our destination:\
  \ the peak. I doubted we would make it.\n\nWe hiked on. It felt good to feel my\
  \ body working. I wished I could do this all the time.\n\nMaybe I could do this\
  \ all the time. I\u2019d create a blog and call it Beautiful Adventures. I\u2019\
  d drive around the country and write about the places and people I met along the\
  \ way. It wouldn\u2019t be easy, of course. Mountain climbing is never easy. But\
  \ reaching the peak makes everything worth it, right?\n\nI shared my idea with Isaiah.\
  \ He agreed if there was a \"best\" way to live, it would be like that. The experiences,\
  \ people, and the world around us make life worth living.\n\nWe closed in on the\
  \ mountain\u2019s ridge. For the first time, I thought we might actually reach the\
  \ peak.\n\nThe slope grew steep. I kept my eyes on the ground. In three-step bursts,\
  \ we scaled the mountain.\n\nAt last, we reached the summit. Miles of valleys and\
  \ rivers stretched out in every direction. Sunbeams broke through the clouds, adding\
  \ magic to the air. We made it.\n\nI started thinking about the blog again. That\u2019\
  s the life I wanted. I wanted to experience everything the world had to offer. A\
  \ life like that is worth striving for. Even if you never make it to the peak, there\
  \ are amazing stops all along the way. All it takes is three steps at a time.\n\n\
  Six months later, I\u2019m writing this scholarship application. Isaiah and I leave\
  \ at the start of May. OurBeautifulAdventures.com is a reality.\n\nThe Blackhead\
  \ Peak hike forced me to consider my life and how I wanted to live it. I sit at\
  \ the edge, the end of one life and the start of another. I know that the road ahead\
  \ won\u2019t be easy, that we\u2019ll fail and have setbacks. But I know we can\
  \ do this too.\n\nAfter all, I\u2019ve climbed a mountain before."
