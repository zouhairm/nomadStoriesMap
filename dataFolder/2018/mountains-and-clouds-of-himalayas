Text: "This was my first Himalayan trek, the precise area was a part of Gharwal Himalayan\
  \ region in Uttarakhand, India. The trek places were Valley of flowers and Hemkund.\
  \ The base camp would be Ghangria, a small village nearby. The valley of flowers\
  \ is visited during the monsoons when the wild mountain flowers start to bloom.\
  \ The valley will be filled with flowers of different kinds and colour. The experience\
  \ is one of a kind as I had never before trekked that long - around 50 kms in 4\
  \ days. It was tiring, but the nature around makes it worth. The path is full of\
  \ greenery and small waterfalls in the mountains. As it was rainy season, expect\
  \ a lot of rains too. So, a rain poncho is a definite take along. The clouds in\
  \ the mountains makes it surreal views. I got so carried away by the clouds, I was\
  \ in them(memories) almost for a month, even after I came back from the trek. \n\
  I traveled with a group of friends and we had taken this trek through a Trek Agency.\
  \ The agency would pick us up from Haridwar Railway station, in a 12-seater vehicle\
  \ till Govind Ghat. They would take care of our stay, food and trek guide. The trek\
  \ was like - Govind ghat to Ghangria(15kms ascending) on Day 1, base camp at Ghangria,\
  \ Trek to Valley of Flowers on Day 2(8 kms including both ways) and back to Ghangria,\
  \ Trek to Hemkund(12 kms including both ways) and back to Ghangria on Day 3, Trek\
  \ back to Govind Ghat (descending) on Day 4. Hemkund is a gurudwar and considered\
  \ holy place. Many people visit to get the blessings. The river Alakananda runs\
  \ all the way alongside from Rishikesh till the path we cover in our trek of Valley.\
  \ \nThe valley is open for half year as the other half year, the valley is under\
  \ heavy snow. So, the villagers welcome the trekkers, tourists in the open seasons.\
  \ It gives them business and earning capacity. Most of them are poor and makes it\
  \ a point to earn something in the tourist season. Few of them open small shops,\
  \ few have mules and carry luggages and people who cannot walk up the mountains,\
  \ few - carry the luggage/ people by themselves in bamboo carry bags. This was something\
  \ that made me think that life can be so difficult for some, and here, I offload\
  \ my bigger backpack to be carried by someone. I cannot carry my own backpack and\
  \ they carry multiple backpacks to earn a few bucks! \nIt is such experiences that\
  \ makes me feel humbled for what I have and be grateful for the life I have got.\
  \ The things I see and feel while I travel and visit new places, keeps me grounded\
  \ and makes me compassionate."
