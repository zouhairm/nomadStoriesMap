Text: "The last thing I expected was to end up in Nuwara Eliya, up in the hills of\
  \ Sri Lanka. \n\nThe stop in Sri Lanka was supposed to be short, a few days on the\
  \ beaches of Colombo, before heading out to the sparkling beaches and azure waters\
  \ of the Maldives. We had arrived in Colombo to torrential downpours near the end\
  \ of December and despite the chill of the winds and drizzle, we made a spur of\
  \ the moment decision to make the trip up to the tea hills. \n\nOnce we set off\
  \ however, packed tight into our cumbersome rain gear and rucksacks, the trip began\
  \ to wear out our patience. Our train left us in the outskirts of Kandy and the\
  \ station master advised us to hitch a ride with any vehicle that would take us\
  \ to Nuwara Eliya as the road was rough during the winter and not many drivers were\
  \ willing to make the journey. We found a small jeep meant to fit six people to\
  \ agree to take us but the driver managed to fit in fourteen to make the trip worthwhile.\
  \ As the hours passed, the mood within the vehicle grew darker as strangers were\
  \ smushed together in the tiny space where even the open windows did not provide\
  \ enough ventilation because of the humid weather. \n\nAt last my friends and I\
  \ got out of the hill station, weary from the whole ordeal, and felt the collective\
  \ chips on our shoulders drop. The vast expanse of hills turning emerald to viridian\
  \ to blackish greens topped with wispy white clouds met our eyes. The air was fresh\
  \ with a hint of tea leaves and a tinge of rain washing over bark and leaf. Suddenly,\
  \ the trip began to seem worth it. Nuwara Eliya felt almost mythical, like in the\
  \ stories where a long journey ends in a place of unimaginable beauty.\n\n\nIt was\
  \ almost dusk by the time we reached Villa Acacia on Lady Horton's Walk in Kalukale.\
  \ We warmed ourselves in the living room and took in the view of the tea gardens\
  \ from the glass walls of the villa from atop our hill. We spent a day of our impromptu\
  \ little trip at the villa and it felt like almost instantly we were making the\
  \ same hard journey back to the path we had planned on. \n\nDespite the short stay\
  \ after the arduous effort it took to get there, as we lay on the beaches of Hulhumale\
  \ island in the Maldives a few days later, enjoying the sunny weather, the rain\
  \ soaked hills, the tea leaf smell and the humming silence of Nuwara Eliya kept\
  \ folding in and out of our thoughts and conversations. To this day, three years\
  \ later, it surprises me how vividly I remember this journey and how the place still\
  \ calls out to me."
