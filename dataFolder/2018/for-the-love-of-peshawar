Text: "\u2018Come on inside sister!\u2019 the old man called to me almost before he\
  \ had opened the metal gates of the hostel. He only had one eye and he was peering\
  \ at me as if he was trying to work out who on earth had arrived at his hostel in\
  \ Peshawar, the heart of Pakistan\u2019s North East Frontier, before light on a\
  \ midwinter morning and during the tail end of the Afghan War.\n\nIt was December\
  \ 2001 and my journey to Peshawar and the door of Munir\u2019s hostel was about\
  \ as crazy as anything Munir could have devised, but the only thing important to\
  \ me at that moment was the hot buffalo-milk chai Munir served me, and his friendly\
  \ face as he invited me inside.\nHe seemed to get that because he didn\u2019t ask\
  \ me any questions about how or why I was there or why it was such an odd hour to\
  \ arrive in a frontier city swarming with Taliban fighters. \n\nWe had moved to\
  \ sit in the courtyard of his hostel. It was old and beautiful in the dawn light.\
  \ Munir told me about the goat he had outside. He would slaughter the animal at\
  \ Eid and give the meat to the poor. He would give all the meat away not just a\
  \ third as was the custom. He didn\u2019t need it he said as he had no family left.\n\
  \nThe first rays of the sun were just creeping through the vine leaves adorning\
  \ the courtyard walls when Munir rose to start up the fire and cook breakfast. \n\
  \u201CPeshawar\u201D he said \u201Cis my land, my heart; welcome to my country\u201D\
  .\n\nI sat in the courtyard for a while longer listening to the stirrings of life.\
  \ My mind whirled though the last seventy-two hours. \nArriving in Delhi just hours\
  \ after the Indian parliament had been bombed by Pakistani militants, hearing that\
  \ the cross-border transports to Pakistan were all closed but that you could walk\
  \ across if you wanted to; the day\u2019s drive to the border alongside a million\
  \ Indian troops being transferred there; the strange walk across no-man\u2019s land,\
  \ being greeted by Pakistani guards playing cricket, getting into an overnight bus\
  \ that would take me from Lahore to one of the wildest outposts at that time; the\
  \ bus trip in full moon light over rivers and through gorges of such extraordinary\
  \ beauty that I could not bare to sleep, even if the bumping and freezing wind from\
  \ the open door had let me; the repeated question \u201CAre you smuggler?\u201D\
  \ from the other passengers who took it in turns to come and sit near me to ask\
  \ with incredulous beaming faces; not knowing whether to laugh or cry...\n\n\u201C\
  Welcome to Peshawar, you will love it,\u201D Munir said as he brought breakfast.\
  \ And I was sure I would."
