Text: "The moon was one hand away, winds were talking to my bones, the road ahead\
  \ going up the ridge was gazing at me as if it had answers to all the curiosities\
  \ of my youth. My heart beat skipped again and again and again as I was falling\
  \ for those five snow capped Himalayan peaks. I still fail to understand if It was\
  \ the silence of the magnificent mountains or the music of the leaves whispering\
  \ with the winds or that hungry dog barking at some far off house on that mountain\
  \ but I have not only lived the mountains of Kasar Devi but I have carried them\
  \ along to my busy life of court rooms in the city.\n\nMore than 2000 kilo meters\
  \ above the sea level, named after a temple, Kasar Devi is usually referred to by\
  \ backpackers as Hippie hills, frequently having been travelled by poets, writers,\
  \ musicians including Bob Dylan and D.H. Lawrence. In the heart of Uttarakhand in\
  \ India, From Kathgodam we travelled up the mountain to Almora and again changing\
  \ the taxi to Kasar Devi. The first thing I loved about Kasar Devi was that it was\
  \ so quiet. Only somewhere far would be a Bob Marley song or a queen track playing.\
  \ Untouched. So were its people. \n\nWhile walking across the stretch across the\
  \ mountain, we decided to climb up a hill. Soon while jumping the cliffs, we saw\
  \ a small library and to our amaze, from Shakespeare to Swami Vivekananda, one room\
  \ library had an impressive collection. We picked two books and while nodding at\
  \ few Israeli old men sun bathing on the roof, we sat looking at the mountains.\
  \ I gushingly smiled at the snow capped mountains falling for the grace with which\
  \ they stand high surviving and embracing the cold . \"Beautiful you are\" I sighed.\
  \ These days I backpack my smiles everywhere along with my favourite sketchers.\
  \ Love and travelling does that to you, I suppose.  \n\n\"Would you like to have\
  \ some pancakes, Madaam ji?\", asked the young lad taking care of the guests and\
  \ backpackers at Ram Singh Guest House and Library. \u201COh yes, please\u201Dand\
  \ very soon handmade , uneven and delicious pancakes were served in a steel plate\
  \ along with two hot cuppa coffee. We were so blessed to be on that mountain at\
  \ that time, we both had realised. We soon left exploring one cliff after another\
  \ to return back to Ram Singh Guest House and never was a time when tea/coffee was\
  \ served without Ram Singh's Pancakes. We returned back to our city life two days\
  \ back with the memory of snow capped mountains and Pancakes -hot, uneven, handmade,\
  \ locale of dear Kasar Devi."
