Text: "Watching a spotty shaggy goat casually perched on top of a villager\u2019s\
  \ turfed grass roof, while munching the greenery, is a sight I will never forget.\
  \ This topsy-turvey scene, unfolding in front of my eyes, was the moment when I\
  \ fell in love with India. I fell in love right there in a small village called\
  \ Dabla, off the beaten track, not a tourist destination unlike its nearest town\
  \ - the beautiful, majestic Jaisalmer. I can still conjure up the sights, sounds\
  \ and smells, as if it was yesterday. The swirl of women in their bold saris as\
  \ they gathered at the market place, crouched down, selling their wares. The chief\
  \ elders with their long moustaches and brightly coloured turbans standing proud\
  \ next to their livestock. The cries of the children shouting out \u201Cnamaste\u201D\
  \ running up to me with their arms outstretched, wanting to hold my hand. The dustiness\
  \ and the contents of the Thar Desert filling my shoes as I walked by, leaving my\
  \ footprints behind in the sand. The cackles of laughter from the female construction\
  \ workers ringing in my ears when I stopped to help them build a road through their\
  \ village. All eyes on me as I tried to balance stones on top of my head, in a metal\
  \ rusty bowl. The warm invitations and offerings of masala chai wherever I went.\
  \  Breathing in the smoke, sitting in a circle watching  the golden milky liquid\
  \ brew on an open fire.  Munching down some piping hot samosa from a street vendor\
  \ -  wrapped in old newspaper, the Hindi print still visible now oily and smelling\
  \ of spices. The thrill of excitement when I opened my eyes to a new town or city\
  \ after spending 7 hrs on an overnight bus and standing outside wrapped in a shawl,\
  \ shivering, waiting for dawn to come and the anticipation of discovering something\
  \ new. I lived for those moments, for the friendships, and the everyday encounters.\
  \ I was in my mid-20s then. And even though I\u2019m somewhat older and slightly\
  \ more weathered by life, my time in Rajasthan will remain as it was, forever suspended\
  \ in time, as a fresh-faced volunteer from the UK, living and working out in the\
  \ Thar Desert."
