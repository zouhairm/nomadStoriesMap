Text: "I sprinted across the gates following my father, Abbu\u2019s, footsteps. The\
  \ rolling clicks on the dozens of carry-on bags rang in my head. I took a quick\
  \ look behind and saw my pink colored headscarf, hijab, flailing. My jaw dropped\
  \ and I stopped, the sudden force propelling me forward against the shiny floor.\
  \ I caught myself as the gawking eyes of other passengers burned into me. I have\
  \ surely gone crazy, to be running across the airport, the least Muslim-friendly\
  \ place, in a hijab. My father\u2019s forehead wrinkled as he jumped into the check\
  \ in line: Was I too late?\nI looked up at the 40 feet escalator, asking my father,\
  \ \u201CYou sure we\u2019re in the right area? I don\u2019t see the sign anywhere.\u201D\
  \ My father grabbed my arm and after reaching the top, we approached a flight attendant.\
  \ She had a welcoming smile, so we asked her about my flight to New York City via\
  \ American Airlines. Her face fell, and she swore loud enough that my father heard.\
  \ She started walking and we followed suit, \u201CYou need to go, take the Terminals\
  \ Train to Terminal 3 and catch your flight.\u201D I started whispering every prayer\
  \ I knew and stepped into the tube-like train, which looked like it was straight\
  \ out of a dystopian novel. Right when we got off, I ran with my father across the\
  \ gates. At the check in line, my father asked the attendant about my flight and\
  \ he quickly gave the boarding pass. \u201COkay good,\u201D my father said. I hurriedly\
  \ showed my pass to the lady and got into the security line. I turned my head around\
  \ the see my father. He was gone. \nThe stale taste of spit lined my dry mouth.\
  \ The blonde haired lady in front of me took her shoes off, and so did I. The blonde\
  \ in front of me put her belongings in a grey compartment and stood under the security\
  \ machine for a bit of time, and I assumed I would do the same. Just as I was about\
  \ to enter, the security guard barked, \u201CTake your sweater off.\u201D Confused,\
  \ I stripped off my sweater and dropped it into the grey compartment. Then I walked\
  \ through, a small smile entering my face as the machine was still. Suddenly, the\
  \ guard grabbed a small taser looking machine, and without question, passed it over\
  \ my hijab. My eyes widened, and I coughed. I could smell the sweat staining my\
  \ shirt. The guard placed it on a tester and thoughts raced through my head. What\
  \ if I wasn\u2019t able to make it? He came back, a grim look on his face. He nodded\
  \ and moved to let me through. That little- No, forget it. This is the first thing\
  \ I should expect while travelling as Muslim."
