Text: "Never have I ever thought that this life would teach me so much on a Journey\
  \ to the hills that lie on the Eastern Coast of the Western Ghats. In the month\
  \ of October, I packed my bags to a small village in the State of Tamil Nadu, India.\
  \ Vattakanal or less famously known as the \u2018Little Israel\u2019, is situated\
  \ in the lap of biodiversity. With fresh montane forest canopy filtering the hot\
  \ sun, the green mosses carpeted on the floor, the place is a marvel of greenery.\
  \ A feast for the eyes. When I reached Vattakanal, the sun was just above the gigantic\
  \ hills. In my mind, a beautiful morning had dawned, but my stomach was growling\
  \ for food. \n\nAltaf\u2019s Caf\xE9, a seasoned local establishment which offers\
  \ a wide variety of cuisine. Ranging from Hummus to Babaganoush, from Sabich to\
  \ Shakshuka, they literally have every kind of Israeli dish. The place was crowded\
  \ with many kinds of people. There were backpackers like me, tourists with family\
  \ (Most foreigners were from the Land of Israel) and in the corner ignoring all\
  \ the chaos, there were sitting a couple of architecture students polishing their\
  \ craft, drawing unseen sketches of structures which I never understood. After having\
  \ Altaf\u2019s finest fresh crusty bread and hot steaming omelet, I set out to the\
  \ famous Dolphin\u2019s Nose. \n\nSurprisingly the course to the Dolphin\u2019s\
  \ Nose is a downhill path. The way was entangled with roots of many trees. It was\
  \ a difficult footslog. With me, there were many other backpackers who dodged every\
  \ curly root, going down the hill. The moment I reached the Dolphin\u2019s Nose,\
  \ I realized that it was a spectacle worth all the effort. Dolphin\u2019s Nose is\
  \ a huge boulder, in the shape of a Dolphin\u2019s Nose, protruding out of the hill.\
  \ Turn by turn, people stood on Dolphin\u2019s Nose. There were panic, fear and\
  \ lots of enthusiasm in the cold breezy air. When finally, it was my turn to trudge\
  \ on to the boulder, there was an eerily moment. I felt like the world has stopped.\
  \ With every step, it was much difficult to breathe. I reached there and I realized\
  \ feelings and thoughts were already there, but just then I could see them. I felt\
  \ like standing on the edge of our beautiful Earth. Peeking into another world,\
  \ I felt peace. The entangled roots down the hill were a life filled with intricacies.\
  \ But all difficulties have to end at some point when Life will reward the bravest.\
  \ Dolphin\u2019s Nose made me brave!!!"
