Text: "Although unseen in omniscient mystery, the wind flows throughout the foothills\
  \ of the Himalayas, making itself known to all creation. Tapering through the valley,\
  \ the gentle breeze enters our stone hut through a cracked window atop the third\
  \ floor and lands softly upon my cheeks. \n \nI begin to regain consciousness from\
  \ a deep sleep. The remnants of my dreams flee before I can recall their existence.\
  \    \n \nI breathe deeply and my nose crinkles at the smell of mildew lingering\
  \ in the air, resonating from the rotten wood pillars desperately struggling to\
  \ keep our roof from toppling over.  Early morning yawns begin to fill the room\
  \ as daybreak shines through the cracks and crevices of our temporary home. I notice\
  \ I had been crying in my sleep from the salt encrusted tears frozen upon my cheekbones\
  \ and lazy icicles underneath my nose.  \n \nThen I remember the date. Today is\
  \ Feb 16, 2015, the two year anniversary of my younger brother's heroin overdose.\
  \  The chill of death freezes my heart and my soul begins to shrivel from within\
  \ at the thought. I push the pain away. Crawling out of my sleeping bag, I am careful\
  \ not to disturb my team members who rest peacefully, their hearts yet to be awoken\
  \ and discouraged from life's disappointments. \n\nI reach for my hand-made paper\
  \ journal from the vibrant town of Thamel, Nepal, a 15-hour drive from the quiet\
  \ village of Solukhumbu. I begin the journey down the creaky staircase of our hut\
  \ and past the room with the Buddhist shrine.  \n\nA fire is blazing from the kitchen.\
  \ Our sherpas are joyful as they prepare our breakfast.  They make me a hot cup\
  \ of butter milk tea, a Nepali favorite. I shoulder my bag, strap up my boots and\
  \ venture towards my safe haven, a place of true belonging that I have created for\
  \ myself among the wheat fields. \n\nAs I gaze into the rising sun and an immense\
  \ feeling of sorrow enters my heart. I had planned to choose joy today and contemplate\
  \ the past two years of navigating through grief.  The last thing I expected was\
  \ that my healing journey would bring me to the village of Solukhumbu in Nepal.\
  \ Then, a smile forms on my face because I know that my brother knew all along.\
  \ I feel my brother\u2019s presence in the warmth of the sun, a familiar and friendly\
  \ constant that soothes my inner turmoil. I am grateful he woke me in the wind this\
  \ morning and now this is all that I have, the present moment. I honor and cherish\
  \ this gift that my brother has given me with my whole heart."
