Text: "\u201CI guess I\u2019m leaving\u2026 you\u2019ll make it back to Costa Rica\
  \ okay?\u201D my now exboyfriend said emotionlessly.\n\u201CYou don\u2019t have\
  \ to worry about me,\u201D I replied, choking back tears.\n\nThis was the last thing\
  \ I expected to happen over the final spring break of my collegiate experience,\
  \ that is for certain. I was a wreck. \n\n It was the end. I told him that I couldn\u2019\
  t go on like this, sacrificing my dreams for someone who was ungrateful and mean.\n\
  \nHe asked me if I was going to make it back to Costa Rica, okay, and he left.\n\
  \nI sobbed and walked down to the concierge. I was determined to snorkel, to see\
  \ coral. I didn\u2019t make it all the way to Panama to not see any coral and this\
  \ was my last day, before having to start my return to Puntarenas. \n\n\u201CThe\
  \ last boat left 15 minutes ago,\u201D the concierge said. \n\nI could not hold\
  \ back the tears. They started rolling down my face. He tried to console me, not\
  \ to much avail. I started walking back to my room, defeated. As I begin up the\
  \ hill, a golf cart drives by me slowly. A nice young man tells me that I am in\
  \ paradise and that I can\u2019t possibly be that sad. He gives me a ride up to\
  \ the summit, where you can see the whole island from each end. I found some peace.\n\
  \nAfter sitting for about an hour, I began to walk back down. Again, I was met with\
  \ another golf cart\u2026 it was the concierge! He was on his way home for the day\
  \ and insisted that I hop on his cart for a ride. I oblige. My new friend begins\
  \ to tell me that on the other end of the island (about two to three miles hike\
  \ from where I was) that there was a lovely beach that I could go find some coral.\
  \ I rode with him to his home along the way and continued on my mission. \n\nSometimes\
  \ I wonder who is looking out for me. A group of Mexican exchange students were\
  \ there on the beach, we became friends. They fed me tuna cracker snacks and fresh\
  \ coconut water from the baby coconuts on the beach. It was like a dream. I didn\u2019\
  t even have a swimsuit with me, but I had no cares, no shame. I borrowed a snorkel\
  \ from my new friends and stripped down to my bandeau and undies\u2026 into the\
  \ ocean, I go.\n\n My heart sang as the sun beat down on my back in those crystal\
  \ clear waters! I saw the coral I so desperately fought to see. My faith in the\
  \ universe was restored. I knew then that I was capable of making anything that\
  \ I wanted possible. No matter the level of difficulty or despair. No matter the\
  \ amount of heartbreak. \n\nFollow your spirit. You know what is right for you."
