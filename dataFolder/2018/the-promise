Text: "He looked at my passport and smirked. \n\u201CAmerican?\u201D\nIt seemed impossible\
  \ to avoid this lurking question. \n\u201CYes, American, but I\u2019m trying to\
  \ pass for French.\u201D\nThe small man peered up to me through his glasses and\
  \ could not hide his curiosity. \n\u201CWhat brings you to Belgium, or I guess the\
  \ question is, why are you flying to Malta?\u201D\nI told him my story, studying\
  \ abroad, working as a journalist while spending all my life\u2019s savings to travel\
  \ in the process. We spoke more about his life, as a successful lutherie and the\
  \ father of four, he told me of his beginnings as a poor apprentice and that he\
  \ was now headed to Malta to a judge an international ceremony.\n\u201CNever stop\
  \ exploring.\u201D \nOnce we landed I began searching for a shuttle. The bus driver\
  \ pulled up and, as usual, I sat in the front seat.\n\u201CWhy are you here?\u201D\
  \ \nThe question took me by surprise, at an existential level I thought about why\
  \ I was I there, who was I, what brought me to this exact point. Instead of getting\
  \ into the depths of life, I shrugged,\n\u201CBecause it\u2019s the weekend.\u201D\
  \nHe laughed as we drove down the twisted road. I tried to make out as much as I\
  \ could of the dimly lit island. He began to tell me the history of the area, but\
  \ I wanted to know about him.\nHe was born in Malta and had never left. He asked\
  \ about my home of Chicago, while sharing his dream to see the world one day too.\n\
  We pulled up to the hotel and as I began to walk up the steps, I heard singing.\
  \ \nThe lyrics of some ABBA song echoed in the darkness.\nI met two intriguing men\
  \ and we shared a beer and spoke about the states.  \n\u201CAmerican huh?\u201D\n\
  An older woman behind the bar inquired. Her eyes lit up as she began to smile, \n\
  \u201CI love America, it is beautiful, but it is nothing compared to Malta.\u201D\
  \nShe was older, in her late 50s, but her eyes felt ageless. During her twenties\
  \ she had driven through route 66, just as I had that previous summer when I turned\
  \ 20. She pulled out a napkin and wrote down all the sites in Malta that I should\
  \ visit and told me to come back before I left to tell her what I thought.\nI couldn\u2019\
  t shake the feeling that this country was my true soul mate. This small place, which\
  \ I heard about only a week prior, had changed my life in ways I\u2019m still unable\
  \ to describe. I returned to her bar just before my shuttle pulled up. I pulled\
  \ out the napkin she gave me, with each destination: 'the window', 'the bay', 'the\
  \ church', and 'the market', checked off. \n\u201CTell everyone about Malta.\u201D\
  \nShe whispered to me and I promised her I would."
