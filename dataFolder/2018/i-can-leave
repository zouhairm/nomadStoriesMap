Text: "I oof my pack into what will be my bedroom for the next three days, and hide\
  \ most of it behind a chair. Home in the states, I find my gear secondhand. My pack\
  \ was a friend\u2019s spare. My field shirt came from goodwill. I\u2019m grateful\
  \ for whatever I get, self-consciousness aside. In this house in the Paraguayan\
  \ campo \u2013 countryside \u2013 I\u2019m embarrassed to have any of it. But not\
  \ in the usual way. \n\nHere, the nylon material is practically alien. Our floor\
  \ is a concrete slab, yielding to dirt in the kitchen. The walls are horizontal\
  \ slats of wood. Tomorrow, my sleeping bag will be soaked: my bed rests against\
  \ a wall. Driving rain assaults the campo, and most of my Peace Corps trainings\
  \ are cancelled. Everything pools into red mud, and no one leaves their house. That\u2019\
  s extra time to connect with our campo host families. The bare lightbulb flickers;\
  \ suspicious of its intentions, I search for my headlamp.\n\nNot all of Paraguay\
  \ is like this. \u2018Developing country\u2019 doesn\u2019t automatically render\
  \ everyone poor.\n\u201CWhy shouldn\u2019t I host an American?\u201D said my city\
  \ host mother. \u201CMy house is very large, there\u2019s plenty of space.\u201D\
  \ Her house was a living room, an eating room, a kitchen, a bathroom, and three\
  \ bedrooms. It\u2019s not small, though I wouldn\u2019t call it large. Here in the\
  \ campo, there\u2019s the main room, a kitchen, and two bedrooms. The door is made\
  \ of chainlink fence. Night insects cruise through to the flickering light.\n\n\
  Enter Evelin, the five-year old granddaughter. She perches avidly on my bed, watches\
  \ me unfurl my sleeping bag. By the time I leave here, half the pages of my notebook\
  \ are consumed by her first efforts at the alphabet. I take part of her with me,\
  \ when I go. I leave behind plastic figurines. Chickens.\n\n\u201CHow pretty your\
  \ things are!\u201D\n\nThat I can\u2019t piece together a response is not only due\
  \ to my rough Spanish. I\u2019m sorry I have pretty things, I audition. But that\u2019\
  s not entirely true \u2013 what I am sorry for is that she doesn\u2019t have them,\
  \ too. \n\nHer eyes pounce. \u201CWhat\u2019s that?\u201D\n\nI don\u2019t know how\
  \ to say \u2018sleeping bag.\u2019 And even if I did, the word would mean little\
  \ here.\n\n\u201CEs una bolsa para dormir.\u201D It\u2019s a bag for sleeping.\n\
  \nThe lights go off, and I turn on the headlamp. It\u2019s ancient. It flickers,\
  \ too. Evelin is compelled to this apparition. So are the bugs.\n\nShe grabs my\
  \ arm and pulls me into the main room, where she presents me as her personal discovery.\
  \ \nIn a few minutes, the bulb flickers on again. I stuff the headlamp away, full\
  \ of conflict. It stays with me when I leave."
