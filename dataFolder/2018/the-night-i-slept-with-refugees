Text: "Shining on a cold summer night that had forgotten to bring the heat promised\
  \ by the calendars, stand next to us a small town hidden in the recesses of the\
  \ Gallic maps where we forged, in claustrophobic and clogged fetid and hot trains,\
  \ our journey. We looked at an Italy that seemed not to want to be within our reach\
  \ and a night that would be short, not justifying paying for a hotel. We set a fallow\
  \ place on a bridge to the train station, sheltered from the rain that soon fell,\
  \ but not from the wind whistling as it passed through all the cracks that were\
  \ there, together with a refugee family to which we asked permission to stay and\
  \ exchange two mouthfuls of conversation.\nUncomfortably covered in the pitiless\
  \ wood that broke our backs, we saw them increasingly forced to be the epicentre\
  \ of dichotomous controversial debates that never allowed us to see the human part\
  \ of the case. They distinguished themselves by staying in that place with no choice,\
  \ with the child sleeping in their arms, never knowing whether this would be the\
  \ last country in their quest for a new home.\n \"In a way, injustice creates in\
  \ you a deep anger, as the nights pass, and you know it better, metamorphoses in\
  \ an almost naive piety. Those exposed to the holocaust are the ones who forgive\
  \ the most, even though they have the greatest right of revolt. \"And time froze\
  \ with the refugee man words.  \"What's wrong with your face?\" He asked in his\
  \ scratched English while hiding the indiscretion of such a question with his gaze\
  \ nailed on a shameful sandwich.\n \"So, did your girlfriend do this to you?\" She\
  \ was clearly bothered by the guilt that the woman's admiration reminded her for\
  \ hours before, in an unconscious instinct of a game of knives, having made an arched\
  \ knife motion, like reaping the wheat on my face, where it lacerated the flesh\
  \ of my cheek, marking an eternal scar, covered with a huge sweaty, dirty dressing,\
  \ running from the lip to the lower eyelid of my left eye.\n\"I was helped, still\
  \ inside the train where it happened, by a surgeon. Then I went to the hospital\
  \ in Bordeaux and from there we took the train here. \"After that, the weight of\
  \ a bloody day walking took the best of me. We woke up at five o'clock the next\
  \ morning and ran to catch the train that made us continue our journey. They stayed\
  \ there, still sleeping. What happened to those people we offered food to and who,\
  \ with a smile on their face and a cosy tenderness, sayed \"No thanks. Ours is enough.\
  \ \"? I just hope it was enough."
