Text: "In spite of my excellent performance in the Basic Education Certificate Examination,\
  \ I wasn't fortunate to gain admission to my first choice senior high school to\
  \ further my education. I gained admission to my second Choice school where I was\
  \ a General Science student. The rejection from my first choice school made me sad\
  \ to the extent that I wasn't studying, eating or sleeping , I was always crying\
  \ for the first two weeks in school. One hot afternoon I heard a voice within me\
  \ telling me \"it does not matter where you are coming from, what matters is where\
  \ you are going\", this phrase kept ringing in my ears for days, that was when I\
  \ realized nothing happens in life without a reason.  \nI accepted my fate and did\
  \ my best and wrote the West African Senior School Certificate Examination and excelled.\
  \ I gained admission into Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology to\
  \ read Civil Engineering. I was the only person from my high school in my department\
  \ and the first person from my school to read civil engineering in that university.\
  \ My coursemates looked down on me because I didn't attend one of the best schools,\
  \ they undermined me in several many ways but that did not deter me from proofing\
  \ to them that it is all about an individuals perspective not the school one attended.\
  \ At the end of the first semester in first year, the results came out and I performed\
  \ better than most of those who claimed they went to the best senior high schools.\
  \ I was really happy , it was there I believed I can really make it. I continued\
  \ to increase every semester throughout my stay in the university and graduated\
  \ with a second class upper honors degree.\nI was retained as a teaching assistant\
  \ in the university and an administrative assistant at the Office of the Provost\
  \ at the College of Engineering for my national service. The Provost of College\
  \ of Engineering wanted to organize an open day for senior high schools in Ashanti\
  \ region, I was privileged to be the one chosen to organize the Open day. I went\
  \ to less privileged schools and was convince their heads to allow them attend this\
  \ program and on the faithful day, they came . After the program, the teachers of\
  \ these students called me to tell me the attitude of students towards their studies\
  \ have changed and that now they are more determined  to make it to the university\
  \ and am glad  my second choice school groomed me to see the best in every situation\
  \ and girls in similar situation look at me and have hope to make it."
