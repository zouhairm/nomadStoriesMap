Text: "Here I brought you a manual for travellers, he said, hoping that it would inform\
  \ me before leaving ... With a wink, I thanked him for his gesture and told him\
  \ I would not use it. The unknown route seduces me, alone or in company. I imagine\
  \ the world as a daisy to be defoliated ... However, the last thing I expected was\
  \ to know Ronda (a Spanish town) in such a particular scenario .\nIt was not enough\
  \ with photos to save the seen and the soul does not find easily the way to archive\
  \ the experience, because it is not only history, art, beauty ... rather a caravan\
  \ of successive surprises that do not finish ordering in single file and leave open-mouthed\
  \ even the most incredulous.\nThe city sits on a plateau cut by a deep cut excavated\
  \ by the Guadalev\xEDn River, which overlooks its historical center, from the colossal\
  \ ruin of more than one hundred meters of elevation, which gives the city a stunning\
  \ panoramic view. This was left behind in front of the wonder that waited me.\n\
  I took the first steps through the Convent of La Merced Church. Around him, French\
  \ soldiers, in the midst of a setting and clothing typical of the historical context\
  \ of the invasion, released into the air roars of shots with rifles and blunderbusses.\
  \ Time, crazed, jumped from one century to another\u2026 Further on, at the doors\
  \ of the church, Spanish dancers made their castanets vibrate and invited visitors\
  \ to join the celebration by beating their palms with joy. The cobbled streets had\
  \ been dressed as a fest with their balconies adorned with flowers and Spanish blankets\
  \  hanging from their bars. Dressed people of the time strolled on horses and carriages,\
  \ leaving visitors to photograph themselves with them. The picturesque streets with\
  \ arches, columns and arabesques and even the least old \u201CMercadillo\u201D,\
  \ characterized by its Baroque farmhouse, dazzling in whiteness, showed festive\
  \ lures.\nThe Plaza of Toros, a space that beats in the bowels of the place, offered\
  \ a space to enjoy the gastronomy, with the traditional pumpkins to the ronde\xF1\
  a, the goat roasted in the mountain style, the chorizos with alcohol and the veal\
  \ with potatoes; as well as its white, ros\xE9 and red wines. \nFinally, the corner\
  \ that Ronda dedicates to romantic travelers, with its sweet violinists.\nFor these\
  \ reasons, it is understood that, the last thing I expected, was to know Ronda showing\
  \ its living history\u2026 are visions that make us blink, get excited and try to\
  \ keep impressions in the retina of the heart. Do not forget to visit it in May."
