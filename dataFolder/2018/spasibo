Text: "I arrived in Moscow as a teenager with a terrible case of hand shakes and stooped\
  \ shoulders during the last year of the Soviet Union. Despite daily Russian lessons\
  \ at the university, for a while the only words I could remember when someone addressed\
  \ me were: Spasibo (thanks), izvinite (sorry), dosvedanya (bye).\nFearing an arranged\
  \ marriage in a few years, I had applied to engineering school without my parents'\
  \ knowledge. I had also wanted to visit the USSR since reading about it in Soviet\
  \ Nari, which showed women as well put-together professionals, in elegant western\
  \ clothing, in charge of their destinies. I received a full scholarship, but my\
  \ parents refused to let me \"go all alone to a communist land, a girl!\" Only after\
  \ I had run away from home, they relented.\nIn October the snow fell and muted the\
  \ landscape, with temperature dropping to minus eighteen degrees. A wall of language\
  \ still separated me from most people. I had not made any friends besides the few\
  \ Indians and Pakistanis. At night I was driven out of my room when my roommate\
  \ and her boyfriend slurped soup loudly for an hour accompanied by grunts.  \nInitially\
  \ I skipped lunch at the university stolovaya because my hands thrashed like fish\
  \ out of water when I entered the cacophonous hall with students from over a hundred\
  \ countries. Then I wore my green hoodie every day so I could hide my hands in its\
  \ pockets and walk between tables with brilliant faces: Angolans with the bluest\
  \ hues, Yemenis in hijabs, Tibetans with mountain tans, porcelain white blondes\
  \ with bold makeup. When they jovially said, \"Klassno!\u201D with thumbs up, I\
  \ wondered if they were referring to my face like an owl in my thick glasses.\n\
  One evening the line for bread extended beyond the block. I skipped and headed home.\
  \ In the distance a small form in a white coat and red scarf moved on the snow.\
  \ Curious, I sped up to find a blue-eyed boy. He did not appear distraught or lost.\
  \ I stayed by him without staring, so it looked like we were together, but not too\
  \ close. I wondered where I would follow him. On the boulevard, he turned in my\
  \ direction. We walked for fifteen minutes, and our eyes met once. \nAt the corner\
  \ he entered my building and crossed the turnstile with a security card like mine.\
  \ In the elevator he pressed number eleven; I hit fifteen. He got out on his floor\
  \ and looked up with a big smile. \"Spasibo!\" he said, holding my gaze till the\
  \ doors closed.\nHe understood what I was doing. I had turned a corner, without\
  \ any words."
