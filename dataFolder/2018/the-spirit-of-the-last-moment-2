Text: "It was my last day in London, about to flying home in the afternoon. I looked\
  \ at a brochure in the hotel lobby and somehow my heart beat very quickly. I immediately\
  \ rushed to the train, still got 5 hours remaining before the flight, felt so excitedly\
  \ anxious knowing I had to make it before time.\n\nI can not blink at the splendor\
  \ of a building that has been home to the Royal family for centuries. It was built\
  \ in the 11th century and has over 1000 rooms in Baroque-Gothic style. There are\
  \ many mysteries and history behind the building that used to be the favorite residence\
  \ of Queen Victoria. It may be a popular destination for tourist to visit in England,\
  \ but the sublime feelings when you stand in it will give you a surreal majestic\
  \ experience. Here I was, Windsor Castle, United Kingdom.\n\nThere was a lot to\
  \ explore around the castle from Queen Mary's dollhouse to Royal state apartments,\
  \ also hundreds of original famous paintings. One of my favorite parts was seeing\
  \ the semi-state rooms, where I could taste a little bit of Royal life since they\
  \ were my childhood imagination. But it was more than a Disney fairy tale. Much\
  \ has happened in this castle, from the golden age to the second world war, this\
  \ place was once a refuge for the Royal family.\n\n\"Did you know that Windsor Castle\
  \ is one of the most haunted castles in England?\" I made a friend with a stranger\
  \ while we were admiring a painting and she opened up an enticing topic. I stared\
  \ at her with a pair of curious eyes as she continued.\n\n\"Some say to see Henry\
  \ VIII wandering around the corridor, and also the ghost of his wife Anne Boleyn\
  \ who died beheaded.\"\n\nIt gave me goosebumps to hear those stories, overwhelmed\
  \ by how complicated the past was. I believe in the existence of those ghosts since\
  \ this place is also home to hundreds of souls buried with diverse reasons of death.\
  \ \n\nThe supernatural stories drove me to find answers I needed and dig more into\
  \ the real history. Along the way to the airport, internet accompanied me discovering\
  \ all the questions about the things that happened there. I had no idea the last\
  \ five hours had made me a lot richer as I dove more into the characters, dark affairs,\
  \ cruel executions, all of them played like a movie in my brain. Traveling plus\
  \ history - a combo of a perfect journey for me. My wanderlust soul made a list\
  \ of castles I would visit when I come back here. I wrote down everything to my\
  \ travel journal as this precious present faded into memorable past."
