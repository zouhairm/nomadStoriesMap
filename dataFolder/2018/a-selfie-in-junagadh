Text: "Can I take a selfie with you? I\u2019m in a crowd of a few hundred thousand\
  \ outside Junagadh, India. I\u2019m not the only foreigner, but likely the only\
  \ blond blue-eyed Russian. And this is probably the 40th selfie I\u2019m posing\
  \ for, this time asked to stand next to an albino man for comparison. \nYou can\
  \ say no, Yakov! My buddy Trupal the photographer laughs from a few meters away.\
  \ He\u2019s seen me do this for the last 4 hours and thinks I\u2019m annoyed. I\
  \ don't like selfies, but this is what I came here to do, just with roles reversed.\
  \ \nTrupal had invited me here to see Maha Shivaratri, a Hindu festival honoring\
  \ the marriage of Shiva, according to one legend. The Junagadh festival is famous\
  \ for the hundreds of Aghori, ascetic monks, who come every year for the 5-day fair,\
  \ culminating in a procession and ritual bath at a local temple.\nThe Aghori are\
  \ intimidating. Many wear nothing but cremation ash. Many don\u2019t cut their hair\
  \ and wear it in matted braids. Many smoke weed. They are reputed to practice sex\
  \ at cremation sites and eat human flesh from funeral pyres. They are believed to\
  \ possess mystical abilities to heal and curse at will. Trupal confesses on the\
  \ way, how as an aspiring photographer, he was afraid of asking to take their pictures\
  \ the first time he was here. And how will I do it, if I don\u2019t even speak the\
  \ language? I think to myself. But I'm determined to not leave without seeing and\
  \ documenting as much as I can.\nMy fears prove groundless immediately as we go\
  \ out on upon arrival that evening. The first sadhu I see, makes eye contact, smiles\
  \ and beckons me to join him. I comply. He offers a joint and points to my camera.\
  \ I refuse the weed with a smile, but take my camera out, relieved. He stands up\
  \ to pose for me and seems pleased with the result. Easy. I thank him and catch\
  \ up with Trupal, who has chosen a subject, gotten permission and is setting up.\
  \ \nWe go from tent to tent for the next two days, when I find myself posing for\
  \ pictures more often than taking them. Looks like a pale blond foreigner is rarer\
  \ in Junagadh than an Aghori. But it reinforces a simple truth, from years of going\
  \ to new places to meet new people \u2013 we are the same in more ways than we are\
  \ not. United by curiosity for the exotic and unfamiliar, we seek to document and\
  \ share images of what we discover. And I like to hope that our impulse to learn\
  \ and capture the strange and foreign ways of others, leads to understanding and\
  \ acceptance.\nCan I take a selfie with you? You bet."
