Text: "Now that I am here, I can not believe how far I have come to make a connection.\
  \ I am happy to be here, but I am nervous. I have so much to learn. When they speak\
  \ to each other, I do not underdtand a word they are saying. Despite the language\
  \ barrier, I am happy to be here. \n\nIt is amazing how much power I have revealed\
  \ to myself. Power that is within me to step out of my comfort zone and allow this\
  \ new experience. Now I must admit, I am definitely shell shocked! This is not something\
  \ I usually dodon't. However, with the divorce and moving back with my parents,\
  \ I felt the need to find something new within myself. I cannot get past the fact\
  \ that I am already divorced. The marriage did not last that long, and yet it felt\
  \ like I was locked in for a lifetime. Only now am I realising how much I needed\
  \ this. To spread my wings and fly away. \n\nHere I am now facing many different\
  \ faces. Listening to the beatiful clicking sounds in this new dialect that I definately\
  \ need to start learn. Ndebele. The smiles on the faces of the people in this land\
  \ are fresh and welcoming. Their laughs are loud and from the gut. They smile at\
  \ me honestly, and they laugh with me sincerely. It is so easy to connect with the\
  \ genuineness of their willingness to lend a hand. I am happy to be here. I amam\
  \ happy to experience this. ..."
