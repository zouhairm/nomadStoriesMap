Text: "I stepped off the train with morbid curiosity of what laid ahead. I had received\
  \ one sheet of paper informing me of my placement- the village of Immenhausen. You\
  \ know you're adventure bound when spellcheck doesn't recognize your location. While\
  \ others in my program went to Berlin, floating the path of countless previous Americans\
  \ in our goal of diplomacy, I was sent to a town that dreamed of topping 7,000 people.\
  \ I was determined to make an impact in this barren town. But how? The answer came\
  \ when I heard of a retirement home.\nI went that very day and rang the bell, peering\
  \ up through the rain at the unmarked building. A confused nurse answered the door,\
  \ and I quickly explained myself.\n\"I'm looking to volunteer. Can I talk to someone\
  \ about helping out around here?\" I asked.\nThe nurse smiled, perhaps at my German,\
  \ and after introductions with the staff, I was in- playing cards with the residents\
  \ on Sundays, and pushing those in wheelchairs around the village on Mondays. \n\
  I was led to the living room, and introduced: \"a new volunteer, all the way from\
  \ the US, came just for us, so smile and say hi!\" \nThe whir of wheelchairs turning\
  \ filled the room as I awkwardly waved. The response was humorous:\n\"An American,\
  \ out here!\" \n\"He's too thin!\" \nThen the interrogation of every part of US\
  \ culture. It was fun German practice, and their joy was ample payment for my 'work'.\
  \ I got to know them well as time passed, and each week I showed up earlier and\
  \ left later. Sundays, we played cards for hours- never did I win. Mondays, we would\
  \ brave the weather and talk at length of philosophy and days long gone, of life's\
  \ finite nature and how to live it best. The unconditional love from the residents\
  \ was a source of hope in otherwise tough times. It pained me to learn I had to\
  \ move again in January, and the news was a shock to all.\n I made certain to spend\
  \ Christmas there before I left. The celebration was joyous, and lasted all day.\
  \ When I finally had to go, there was palpable sadness in the room. Uschi, one of\
  \ my favorite residents, pulled on my shirt. Everyone was smiling. \n\"We came together\
  \ to make you a gift.\" She announced. I was presented with a thick scarf, knitted\
  \ from the collective efforts of my friends. \"For all you've done.\", read the\
  \ attached card. \nI've since returned stateside, and have switched from business\
  \ to teaching and counseling in my studies and work. In the coldest, greyest days,\
  \ I wear my scarf, and smile at the creation of joy between my friends and I."
