Text: "I picked up a manga and flipped through, unable to read a single word. It was\
  \ reality that I accepted when I came to study abroad here, but it made me a little\
  \ sad that I couldn\u2019t indulge in my favorite thing \u2013 books. Despite this,\
  \ I bought the manga anyways, hoping I would be able to read some of it at the end\
  \ of my study abroad program. \n\nAfter leaving the bookstore, I caught up with\
  \ my friends who were looking at school supplies. Of course I got distracted by\
  \ the colorful stationary. As I was fawning over the cute anime characters, my eyes\
  \ caught a small boy staring at me. I smiled at him, but his stare didn\u2019t break.\
  \ \u201COkaa-san!\u201D He whined, tugging on his mother\u2019s hand and pointing\
  \ at me. His mother looked up at what was distracting her son \u2013 me. Her face\
  \ blanched in embarrassment and pulled her son away, scolding him. \n\n \u201CThat\
  \ was weird,\u201D I murmured, unease twisting my stomach as I watched the pair\
  \ walk away; the mother still scolding her son. \n\nMy friend rolled her eyes. \u201C\
  That\u2019s what I get every day.\u201D \n\nOver the next several weeks, there were\
  \ more stares and mothers scolding their children. The worst incident was one weekend\
  \ during my host family stay. The only place we were able to bath was at the onsen.\
  \  Being completely naked with strangers wasn\u2019t new territory, but the onsen\
  \ was crowded with locals enjoying the hot springs. While they were relaxing, I\
  \ was tense as eyes locked on me. Never had I experienced being the one white girl\
  \ in the room. My long blonde, curly hair and light eyes were my calling card: \u2018\
  Come look at the foreigner!\u2019 I didn\u2019t blame them for staring at me. I\
  \ was the only non-Asian person within a few square miles. But still, my body felt\
  \ even more exposed than it already was. \n\nWith every incident, I would think\
  \ back to my friend who pointed out to me that was what she experienced in the US,\
  \ every day. As I struggled learning Japanese, I felt stupid for not being able\
  \ to speak or read, and I was helpless since I relied on my Japanese friends to\
  \ do simple things such as ordering food. When I got back to the States, I saw how\
  \ immigrants struggled \u2013 getting stared at while their broken English became\
  \ punchline of many jokes. It was the same way I felt but to a more extreme degree.\
  \ There were many positive experiences I took away from studying abroad, but this\
  \ one was the most valuable. I learned what it meant to be \u2018othered\u2019."
