Text: "I spent all my early teen years in Cape Town. Not even once did I ever think\
  \ I would find myself going to Eastern Cape. I never knew anything about that part\
  \ of South Africa besides from stories my mother used to tell me.\nIt was those\
  \ stories that made me more interested and some other things such as people from\
  \ there relocating to cape Town, Johannesburg and Durban just to name a few. At\
  \ the time I thought there was no life there since people were leaving but they\
  \ were leaving because of employment.\nI fell very ill when I was around 20 years\
  \ of age. My mom and I had to go to doctors who never found anything wrong with\
  \ me so couldn\u2019t help me. Then my mom told me that I had to travel to the Eastern\
  \ Cape so that people from my biological father\u2019s side could perform a traditional\
  \ ceremony for me so I did.\nWhen I got there it was like I was in a totally different\
  \ world since the only place I knew was Cape Town, I never expected to see most\
  \ thing there which I hardly saw in Cape Town. I grew up seeing different races\
  \ and people speaking different languages. In mount frere every were I went I kept\
  \ on seeing so much  live-stock in one area, people had a different accent from\
  \ the one I had. Some times when I spoke they couldn\u2019t understand me and from\
  \ my side I sometimes couldn\u2019t understand them because of the difference in\
  \ the words they were used to and I was used to.\nI spent about a month there experiencing\
  \ something different which I never thought I would.\nI watched a cow being slaughtered\
  \ in front of me for the first time, that was very terrifying especially the deafening\
  \ sound it made when it cried. To them that sound meant something good, it meant\
  \ that the ceremony was accepted by the ancestors."
