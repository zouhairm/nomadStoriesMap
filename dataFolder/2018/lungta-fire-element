Text: "On our second day in Thimphu, our guide, Kinga, took us to the Jungshi Paper\
  \ Factory to learn how the locals make paper from the bark of Daphne trees. As with\
  \ all handicraft tours, there was a store at the end where tourists could purchase\
  \ paper products, such as journals, cards, and paintings. When I entered the store,\
  \ my eyes locked on a black framed painting hanging on the wall, with three Buddhist\
  \ monks in deep red robes floating towards the white steps of a dzong. I stared\
  \ at it for a while, entranced by the ornate details and peaceful feeling that came\
  \ over me. That night, I had a dream about the painting and I knew I had to have\
  \ it. The following morning, we were leaving for two nights in Punakha Valley, but\
  \ I knew we had to drive back through Thimphu on our way to Paro a few days later,\
  \ and Kinga agreed to take us back. Fast forward two amazing days and I was back\
  \ at the store, but when I walked in, the wall looked different. The painting was\
  \ gone and another painting hung in its place. After much conversing between Kinga\
  \ and the young man working there, I learned that the painting had just been sold.\
  \ Before the disappointment could sink in, Kinga told me that the young man was\
  \ actually the artist, Tshering Wangdi, and he\u2019d offered to paint it again\
  \ for me. This was the last thing I expected! We were leaving Bhutan in two days,\
  \ which allowed just enough time for Tshering to recreate the painting, let it dry,\
  \ package it for safe traveling, and drive the hour from Thimphu to Paro so I would\
  \ have it in hand the night before I left Bhutan. Tshering was picking up a friend\
  \ at the airport in Paro the next day and said if I was satisfied with the painting,\
  \ he would drop it off at my hotel in exchange for cash. However, since we were\
  \ out hiking Tiger\u2019s Nest Monastery (Takshang Goemba) that day, and Kinga didn\u2019\
  t want any confusion leaving the cash with the hotel staff, Tshering agreed to leave\
  \ the painting without payment and allow Kinga to deliver the cash to him back in\
  \ Thimphu after he took us to the airport the next morning and was on his way back\
  \ home. In what some might consider a drug-deal-style arrangement, I purchased the\
  \ painting from Tshering. The effort that went into this deal is a testament to\
  \ the generous, trusting, and happy people of Bhutan. The painting is called Lungta\
  \ Fire Element, and Kinga told me that lungta means \"good fortune\". It was painted\
  \ especially for me on paper made from the bark of Daphne trees at Jungshi Paper\
  \ Factory."
