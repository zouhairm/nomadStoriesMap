Text: They say if you think you're too small to make an impact,try spending the night
  in a room with few mosquitoes.I always used to console myself with this philosophical
  reflection whenever my girlfriend said that I was still not acquainted  with the
  other side of my personality which I would come across in case I indulged in a solo
  self-discovery trip.Being a philosophical writer,embarking on a trip all by myself
  never struck my conscience.Until the day she left for Canada,I firmly decided to
  visit Hikkim,a small town in Himachal Pradesh around 200 kms from Manali.This is
  where the highest post-office in the world is situated.Accompanied by a backpack,
  a DSLR camera and some apprehensive reluctance I had begun my journey with my eyes
  gazing at a silver-lined trail of clouds and my mind ransacking my thoughts.It felt
  as if it was not the bus which ascended  to an elevation but my mind through the
  winding roads while coming across different kinds of people in the form of exotic
  trees,exuberant streams and expressive mountains.After reaching,I hiked to a mesmerizing
  spot where a nearby stream whispered to the surrounding mountains and a cannabis
  plantation peeked through my tent's crevices.I met the solitary postman who had
  been serving for forty-two years all by himself.He was dumb post a severe accident
  in the Indo-China War and executed every postal tasks without any complaints while
  seeking solace to the fact that he lived in the most beautiful post-office.A town
  devoid of networks connected only through letters.He had  requested for an assistant
  from the government.Since I stayed over at his insistence,after a very delicious
  local meal,he showed photographs of his daughter and played old cassette recordings
  of his own voice and wept at the tragedy,his life was after which I sang my heart
  out.While shooting some nightscapes I came across a tombstone which read:The Day
  I Stop Talking,You'll know I'm dead- Love you Dad,Always yours Avantika.That morning,he
  suffered a cardiac arrest and something persuaded me to take him to the hospital.And
  he took his last breathe.After returning to his place,my backpack and the camera
  was gone.and suddenly my phone rang.It was Avantika,my girlfriend from Canada greeting
  me a good night(10.5 hours behind).And I wished my existence to be back in that
  time seperating the innocence from deception.Then again Death created time to grow
  the things it could kill.I returned without any snaps or recordings but I had a
  story to express.
