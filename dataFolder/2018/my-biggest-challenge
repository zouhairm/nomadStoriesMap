Text: "I was all too na\xEFve when I excitedly embarked on my first solo trip to Europe\
  \ for 10 weeks. Little did I know of the looming danger that lurked behind the scenes\
  \ of glorious Instagram photos!\n\nOn my first birthday alone, I was in Lisbon.\
  \ It was hot, foreign, and staggeringly beautiful. Having devoured a Pastel de Nata,\
  \ I stopped for gelato. As I reached for my wallet, I noticed that my purse was\
  \ wide open. A thief had trailed behind me, unzipped my bag with ninja-level stealth,\
  \ and stolen my wallet. In the five minutes between egg tart and ice cream, my day\
  \ had gone from \"Eat, Pray, Love\" to the end of the world. I lost my passport\
  \ and $500. Happy birthday!\n\nA week later, I was in Porto running for dear life\
  \ in 4-inch heels on cobblestone - uphill. No one was around to save me from the\
  \ man who laughed maniacally as he chased after me. Paint him white, and stick a\
  \ red ball on his nose, we have my worst nightmare.\n\nBy the time I got to Belgium,\
  \ I felt quite defeated. Europe really forced me out of my comfort zone and threw\
  \ me into the depths of my vulnerability. I was miserable, homesick, and raw from\
  \ tears. Bruges was a fairytale, but where was my fairy godmother? I felt like a\
  \ failure. I'd emptied my bank account for an epic trip; I was supposed to be filled\
  \ with joy, spirit, and undying curiosity. While my body was in Bruges, my mind\
  \ was a million miles away, at home. My friends were graduating college and starting\
  \ lives in new cities. I was missing so many milestones. The level of loneliness\
  \ I felt was shocking. Yet, I had no energy to make more strangers into friends.\
  \ I told my family that I'd be home five weeks early.\n\nBut boy, am I glad that\
  \ I stayed.\n\nFor every awful day, there were even more wonderful days filled with\
  \ kindness: the lady in Lisbon who found my passport in the trash, generous Couchsurfers\
  \ who housed me, the Germans who skipped work to show me around, and the stranger\
  \ in Santorini who offered tweezers when I stepped on a sea urchin. I discovered\
  \ a new meaning to friendship. Europe led to so much self-discovery, growth, and\
  \ a deep appreciation for home. \n\nI've since embarked on more journeys - I spent\
  \ four months backpacking Asia and three months living in Vancouver. I am a developing\
  \ traveler, passionate writer, and an ambitious professional with a captivating\
  \ story.\n\nThe cherry on top? I met a beautiful man at my hostel on that memorable\
  \ birthday\u2026and started dating him in Canada a year later.\nLet's hope that\
  \ I live happily ever after."
