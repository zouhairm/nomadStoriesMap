Text: "'What brings you to Auroville?', I found myself asking new faces this question\
  \ very often, I was looking for Salt in their answers. \nThree months ago, I left\
  \ home to travel for next one year. I sold the assets I had and donated things that\
  \ I couldn't put a price tag on. I left home for the simple reason; my life had\
  \ started to miss salt. You see, where I come from food is a ritual and a thousand\
  \ spices go in to make that perfect all-senses pleasing experience. Salt is the\
  \ simplest of all spices but the ensemble falls apart if THIS one spice is missing\
  \ and my life was missing that. \nLiving in a landlocked city like Delhi I felt\
  \ the desperate need to move towards the ocean. The plan was to be in Auroville\
  \ for two weeks, learn to surf (I am way too optimistic) move to Sri Lanka for a\
  \ month, keep practicing Spanish all this while and then buy a ticket to Argentina\
  \ and travel from Buenos Aires to New York over a period of one year. I wanted to\
  \ speak better Spanish than a native speaker. I love things with all I got and Spanish,\
  \ the language, and Salt of course are few of those things. \nI could stick to that\
  \ plan for only Two days. I came to Auroville and fell in love with an abandoned,\
  \ sick, starving, four year old dog. I decided to nurse him back to health, take\
  \ him to the nearest city and get him adopted into a loving home. It would only\
  \ delay me by a fortnight but if it's love one really can't count days, or a lifetime.\
  \ \nI transported the dog to Chennai and found a stranger who agreed to host my\
  \ big dog and I. Yes, miracles happen. By the 9th day he got adopted and on 10th\
  \ day he came back to me with an injured foot, the family was loving but a curious\
  \ Dane wasn't their dog. He was groggy after his surgery and in between he opened\
  \ his eyes a few times to make sure that I was there next to him. In that moment,\
  \ I decided to stay and be his human. I could go to South America whenever I wanted\
  \ but this dog who trusts me needed me more.\nSo, I stayed, started living in Auroville\
  \ with my Dog. The plans to travel are on hold for now, it may seem foolish but\
  \ the dog is the best thing that happened to me and gives me the strength to make\
  \ a new plan, in a new town, make a little more money so that he can travel with\
  \ me or make new friends who would love him when I am gone for a few months. \n\
  Life changed unexpected and I love the change. Everything is always better when\
  \ you have your soul-mate next to you and I have mine with me. Other blessings are\
  \ on their way."
