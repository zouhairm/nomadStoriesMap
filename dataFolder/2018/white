Text: "White. The paper under my pen is still white. But I have a lot to tell, so\
  \ I start writing. Everything happened that day, exactly one month ago. I was just\
  \ a normal man, with my twenty-one years, my boring job in an office, with a girlfriend\
  \ that I didn\u2019t love and a family that you could barely define with this name.\n\
  \nI had a job, I had someone that used to think about me. But there was something\
  \ in my life that simply wasn\u2019t working. I was empty and I knew it. I was focused\
  \ on things of which I didn\u2019t really care, I was  letting the present to pass\
  \ through me as if it wasn\u2019t important. As if it wasn\u2019t my life. I was\
  \ living for the expectations of the others, of my family, of my friends, of my\
  \ boss, I didn\u2019t have the control on my life. \n\nThan, one month ago, I saw\
  \ a woman. She was beautiful and she was walking on the other side of the street,\
  \ I wanted to stop her, to know her name, and while I was searching the words she\
  \ crossed the street in front of me. And a bus ran over her.\n\nI stopped I gazed\
  \ the colours of the bus, and the little drops of blood on the windows. Then, I\
  \ don\u2019t know how, I took the control on my body and I started moving towards\
  \ the front of the bus. Some people were creating a circle around the body. Anyway\
  \ I saw through the undefined bodies her face. Her eyes hit me as a gunshot.\n\n\
  I started running the faster I could without a direction and when I started panting\
  \ I continued running, when my legs started to hurt I continued running, people\
  \ were staring at me but I continued running. I don\u2019t think I ever ran this\
  \ much in my whole life. When I stopped I collapsed on the ground with the back\
  \ against the wall of a palace. I started crying. It was the first time since I\
  \ was fifteen. But this time I wasn\u2019t crying for something that went wrong,\
  \ neither for the woman. I was crying for me. I was alive, it seems strange, obviously\
  \ I was alive, but the fact was that I hadn\u2019t feel that long since. I realized\
  \ that I was sick and tired of my life. I knew that I was lucky but that life simply\
  \ wasn\u2019t what I wanted. And the real problem was that I was waiting for a better\
  \ life, for the happiness, but I wasn\u2019t doing anything to reach them. And there,\
  \ with my back against the wall I took the decision that pushed me to the edge and\
  \ changed my life.\n\nI am here now, sitting in this train and I am writing how\
  \ I left my old life and I have begun a new one. I don\u2019t know if it will be\
  \ better but now I am creating my own life. Now I am alive."
