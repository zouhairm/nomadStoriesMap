Text: "A 30 Million Year Time Travel - Going Down The World's Highest Commercial Fixed\
  \ Line Abseil\n\nThe main reason to pick this specific trip though was to test my\
  \ boundaries and push me to the edge. To finish and accomplish a challenge to do\
  \ things I had never done before and get out of my comfort zone.\n\nNo tour seemed\
  \ to test the limits better than the epic Lost World Tour in the Waitomo Caves in\
  \ New Zealand. It is a 7 hour tour of which I spent 5 hours in a giant dark cave.\
  \ It started with a 100m abseil to test my fear of heights. Once we reached the\
  \ platform for the abseil I could feel the cold from the cave rising up and the\
  \ misty air started to surround me. All of a sudden I felt this connection with\
  \ this ancient world we were about to enter and we would be part of for the next\
  \ few hours. As I looked down the crack in the rocks which were about to descend\
  \ into for 100 meters I felt fear and excitement at the same time. As I sat down\
  \ in the harness I started to take a look around me and truly take in the environment,\
  \ the plants growing on the rocks beside me, the river beneath me thunderously flowing\
  \ into the darkness of the cave and the cold misty air filling my lungs.\nOnce we\
  \ reached the bottom after a 30 minute descend, it was there, this feeling of fascination,\
  \ exhilaration and excitement all at once. The most versatile feeling I ever felt.\
  \ Fascination about this ancient place with so much history, exhilaration over the\
  \ accomplishment of a 100m abseil and excitement of what lies ahead of us in the\
  \ darkness.\nAs we started to walk into the darkness and I took a last glance up\
  \ the rays of sunlight shining through the hole above us, it was clear there was\
  \ no way back. I had to finish this journey. This included walking upstream with\
  \ a thick wetsuit on and gumboots filled with water, climbing over huge rocks. I\
  \ had to jump into a pool of black water and swim with gumboots on. This being a\
  \ challenge by itself it was even more of a challenge not to lose the gumboots and\
  \ having to walk with just socks on. \nIt was then when we were told to lay down\
  \ on a giant rock, turn off our torches and look up. The view was amazing. Thousands\
  \ of glow worms lit up the caves as if I was looking at the most amazing star filled\
  \ skies. They were all around us, the glow worm species only to be found in New\
  \ Zealand (Arachnocampa luminosa). At this moment I felt pure inner peace and confidence\
  \ that this trip was the best decision as I had learned a lot about myself (and\
  \ glow worms)."
