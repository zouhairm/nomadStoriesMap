Text: "The stone steps stretched ahead of me like a tower of worn down bones. My husband\
  \ and our two fellow adventurers have sped on ahead, keen to reach the summit, but\
  \ my progress is hindered by a badly broken big toe following an unfortunate encounter\
  \ with a bed leg in the hotel last night.\n\nI question my sanity as I continue\
  \ upward. Our planned descent of this mountain will not be using anything as conventional\
  \ as steps. We will be dropping in through a small hole at the top, and lowering\
  \ ourselves 82 feet into the cave below. \n\nHell\u2019s Cave. The name doesn\u2019\
  t fill me with hope.\n\nThe Marble Mountains are five craggy outcrops topped with\
  \ pagodas, just north of the lively city of Hoi An in central Vietnam, visited regularly\
  \ by tourists and Buddhist monks alike. The whole place has a calm, serene feel\
  \ to it. It is quiet, still. I feel at peace, despite the throbbing emanating from\
  \ the depths of my hiking boot.\n\nHoi An is famous for its market stalls and tailor\
  \ shops, that measure you up, take your order, and have complete custom fit clothes\
  \ ready for you the next day. We made our selections yesterday, so today we have\
  \ escaped the jostling crowds and incessant calls to \u2018come in, take a look\u2019\
  , and have headed up the coast road for an adventure.\n\nThe higher I progress,\
  \ the better my views of Da Nang Bay and the surrounding countryside. The beauty\
  \ fills my soul and I smile. At the start of the day, our guide informed us that\
  \ the monastery here still has monks resident, so I keep my eyes peeled for the\
  \ unmistakable saffron of their robes. \n\nI am trying to remember the lessons we\
  \ have just learnt about knot tying, how to arrange the carabiners and which hand\
  \ should go where. I also try and figure out whether or not I can do this on one\
  \ foot, so as to not aggravate my injury any further. \n\nLost in my thoughts, I\
  \ don\u2019t realise at first there is someone next to me on the steps, very gradually\
  \ overtaking me. I turn and see a monk to my right, effortlessly climbing the steps\
  \ to the monastery. I keep pace with him, and we find ourselves walking perfectly\
  \ in time with one another, step by step. After another minute, I turn to face him\
  \ again, and this time he turns to me and smiles. I smile back. \n\nNothing is said\
  \ but suddenly I feel completely at ease. \n\nWe continue side by side until we\
  \ reach the top, where he enters the monastery, and I find my group. Moments later,\
  \ harnessed up, I slowly drop backwards into the cave, the smile still very firmly\
  \ planted on my face."
