Text: "Three darts. That is all that is standing between me and glory. I take aim.\
  \ Miss. It is hot and humid and the pressure is on. Second shot. Miss. Third shot...\n\
  \nA few hours ago I wasn\u2019t expecting my evening to turn out quite like this.\
  \ From bumper cars and neon lights, to barbecued frog and the competitive art of\
  \ balloon popping, this sweltering night in Siem Reap was like no other.\n\nAvoiding\
  \ the tourists of Angkor Wat, I head towards 60 Road. Home to the Kyung Yu Market.\
  \ Home to one of Siem Reap\u2019s best kept secrets. For something that is so close\
  \ to the Angkor Booth, there are surprisingly few tourists. Hundreds of locals arrive\
  \ at dusk to meet friends, set up picnics and enjoy the sunset. The air is thick\
  \ with aroma as barbecue-stands line the streets selling the most fantastic looking\
  \ fare. First up, deep-fried crickets and pan-roasted worms. The crickets were surprisingly\
  \ tasty, much like crisps. But the worms - a crunchy exterior with a hot molten\
  \ center \u2013 enough said.\n\nRecovering from my last snack, I head towards the\
  \ stand with the longest queue \u2013 a fool proof way of finding the best food\
  \ in town. Here I tuck into lemongrass-stuffed frogs, sweet grilled quails and chicken\
  \ heart kebabs.  Each delicious and washed down with an ice-cold Angkor beer. We\
  \ aren\u2019t just here for eating, we are here for so much more. Towards the end\
  \ of the market, the neon lights guide us in the right direction. When we get there,\
  \ we know instantly that we have made it.  We have made it to the carnival.\n\n\
  A round of bumper cars will make anyone feel like a kid again. The music is turned\
  \ up and we are let loose for five minutes of sheer joy. There is nothing quite\
  \ like the chaos that exists when you practise the art of ramming other people\u2019\
  s cars while retreating in fear from that twelve year old with nothing to lose.\
  \ The laser show around us lights up the faces of our rivals, all with that same\
  \ look both glee and fear.\n\nLast stop, a visit to the \u2018pop the balloon\u2019\
  \ stand. The task sounds simple enough \u2013 get three darts, pop a balloon, and\
  \ win a prize. Challenge accepted! With two darts thrown and no balloons popped,\
  \ the pressure mounts. With sweaty palms, I release my hopes together with that\
  \ last dart. I (luckily) clip the edge of a lime green balloon. It pops. I breath\
  \ a sigh of relief. With my pride miraculously intact, I go forward to claim my\
  \ prize. My reward? A choice between a warm Angkor beer, a coke or some washing\
  \ powder. Being in Siem Reap, Angkor was the easy choice."
