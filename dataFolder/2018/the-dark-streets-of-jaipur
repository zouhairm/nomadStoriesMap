Text: "Thundering cracks pierced my ears from a block away, leaving behind a high\
  \ pitched ringing. \u201CThis is it,\u201D I thought. \u201CThe danger everyone\
  \ warned me of, about backpacking India with two other women.\u201D My heart pounded\
  \ in my ears.\n\nWe arrived in Jaipur that evening, exhausted by a day of contending\
  \ with relentless salesmen of the crowded bazaar street markets. We opted for a\
  \ simple hotel- hot water not included- in a quiet area to recharge. India\u2019\
  s draining stimuli of the day prescribed that I retreat to read my copy of The Bhagavad\
  \ Gita. It wasn\u2019t until we noticed the glow of the moon through the window\
  \ that my friends and I decided to explore the area we were calling \u201Chome\u201D\
  .\n\nAs we walked down a poorly lit street, the roaring bangs startled me. My instinctual\
  \ panic was cut short by the sparkles of fireworks above us, and the sharp \u201C\
  rit-ticka-tick-ticka-tick\u201D of what sounded like tin percussion getting closer.\
  \ From the direction of the commotion, was a parade of locals dressed in stunning\
  \ red saris and shimmering formal wear, dancing their way toward us. While many\
  \ members of the party were holding torches and instruments, there was no excuse\
  \ to not energetically bounce with the rapidly beating music. As the crowd paraded\
  \ passed, a man in the middle of the procession rode elegantly by, on a white horse.\
  \ \u201CThis has to be a wedding!\u201D I yelled to my friends, excited to glimpse\
  \ into the Indian culture. \n\nAs the second half of the ceremony passed, a group\
  \ of women with beaming smiles left their bunch and hopped towards us, reaching\
  \ their hands out. Soon, many hands were on my arms, gently pulling me into their\
  \ dancing circle. \n\nClumsily trying to mimic the women\u2019s moves, I was overwhelmed\
  \ by their openness to invite three white girls from the side of the road into their\
  \ festivities. I shouted, \u201CYou are all so beautiful!\u201D They all laughed.\
  \ \u201CNo, you are beautiful,\u201D one of them giggled with her thick accent,\
  \ reaching for my hand. My eyes brimmed with water. We didn\u2019t follow the same\
  \ traditions, or live in the same country, or even know each other\u2019s names,\
  \ and yet, all around me were gleeful grins that radiated love and acceptance. I\
  \ felt immense belonging at that moment; simply women letting the other know that\
  \ she is beautiful and loved.\n\nJust as suddenly as they arrived, they danced out\
  \ of sight, leaving my friends and I alone again. I wondered whom I would meet next\
  \ in the dark streets of Jaipur, as I listened to the \u201Crit-ticka-tick-ticka-tick\u201D\
  \ in the distance."
