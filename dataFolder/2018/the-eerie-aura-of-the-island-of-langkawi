Text: "For me travel means losing certainties about the world around you and about\
  \ yourself. What if someone, out of the blue, tells you you're able to see dead\
  \ people? I met Robert almost by chance and it\u2019s kind of a clich\xE9 when it\
  \ comes to strange encounters. At that time I had embarked on a six-month journey\
  \ throughout Southeast Asia, with Malaysia being the first Country in my \u201C\
  wandering list\u201D. He accepted to host me via Couchsurfing for a couple of nights\
  \ in his house located in Kuah Town, on the island of Langkawi. Despite showing\
  \ a bit of diffidence, I immediately understood something was going on under the\
  \ surface between me and him and I asked him to stay longer. Probably feeling the\
  \ same kind of connection, he agreed. I vividly remember when he started telling\
  \ me about some weird events which happened to him: we were in his car on the south-west\
  \ coast road at the time that he told me of this headless human standing on the\
  \ road side. And that wasn't his only \"paranormal experience\". Langkawi had a\
  \ lot to tell in terms of ghosts stories and most of them feature Robert as a protagonist\
  \ apparently. Starting to disclose his past, Robert told me he had been able to\
  \ see dead people from a very young age, going so far as to state that he could\
  \ understand them, yet not directly communicate with them. Then came the revelation:\
  \ the reason why he was feeling the same kind of connection I felt was due to the\
  \ fact that in his opinion I could have the same gift. It may sound silly, I know,\
  \ but I was so fascinated about the whole thing I gave him a chance. To test my\
  \ ability he had me going through a curious washing ceremonial with some local flowers\
  \ and then at night he brought me to some creepy abandoned Hindu burial grounds\
  \ around the island. Furthermore, he took me jungle trekking along a lost trail\
  \ leading to an abandoned village where he assumed I could experience something.\
  \ This was followed, for the same reason, by a visit to a huge and dark cave in\
  \ the middle of the night. There's no need to say that \"Eagle Island\" would never\
  \ again be the same for me: an eerie aura had befallen those most mystical places.\
  \ The truth is that after all these trials I haven't had been able to see any ghosts.\
  \ Leaving the island Robert made sure to warn me that there was no coming back from\
  \ the ritual, I had to live with my gift. I still don't know whether Robert was\
  \ hiding a secret truth or just being a scammer but he made me want to believe that\
  \ I am a bridge between two worlds."
