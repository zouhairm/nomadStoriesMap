Text: "We could see the whole city from there. Architecture started to change into\
  \ abstract forms, merging into the mountain. It was Sacromonte, one of the oldest\
  \ districts of Granada. The view of caves brought us back in time, to an unknown\
  \ place away from the city, contrasting with the Alhambra palace on the opposite\
  \ side of Darro river. After the Christian conquests, nomadic Roma people in Granada\
  \ took advantage of Jews and Muslims fleeing the city and inhabited the whitewashed\
  \ caves under the Valparaiso mountain left behind. The neighbourhood was thought\
  \ to shelter outcasts, the marginalized, because of being outside the city walls,\
  \ outside the law and ecclesiastical control. \nShiny copper pots were hanging on\
  \ snow-white walls with small windows. Not a single tourist was strolling around\
  \ \u2013 we were out of season, and the Flamenco shows were being held only once\
  \ a week or during fiestas. But the people were so kind to extend the best of their\
  \ hospitality, showing around and sharing the music. The distinctive type of Flamenco\
  \ danced here is called Zambra, but you can hear the locals saying, it is not the\
  \ true Flamenco, though the passion and distinctive style is hard not to notice.\n\
  We did not get a chance to see it, however, there was something more breath-taking.\
  \ In the yard, we entered and many others on the way, we noticed buckets with clay\
  \ and white lime, used for decorating. I was curious, what it was for. So, our friend\
  \ took us to one of the cave-houses. Inside was just as white as the outside, with\
  \ copper plates and pots hanging on the walls, strange light and water, mud and\
  \ dirt on the floor. I was surprised until I saw the cause of all this mess.\nSacromonte\
  \ is not the wealthiest neighbourhood in Granada. Expanding your house is a struggle\
  \ because of real estate costs, lack of space and nature. But living in these conditions\
  \ for generations, Roma people learned to adapt and take advantage of what in another\
  \ case would be a setback. The mud was from a slow excavation works inside every\
  \ and each household. The house walls are usually not only constructed from clay,\
  \ but the inside walls were a part of the mountain. People are advancing inside\
  \ the mountain.\nIt was the last thing we expected to find and had so many questions\
  \ that were unanswered because of our friend kindly suggested we should get moving.\
  \ The human struggle against both the society and nature was surprising and inspiring\
  \ at the same time \u2013 Granada, Valparaiso mountain, I will come back!"
