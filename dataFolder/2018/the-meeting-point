Text: "In the mid of February, I decided to visit Pushkar. A small pilgrimage town\
  \ situated in the foothills of the Aravali mountain ranges; it is named after the\
  \ great lake around which it is nestled. \nThis time of the year brings the best\
  \ out of Pushkar, not too crowded, not too sleepy, preparing for the festival of\
  \ colours i.e. Holi; at a yogi\u2019s pace. \nIt is a town of meandering cows, fluttering\
  \ pigeons, wide-smiled Indians and a surprisingly high number of foreigners roaming\
  \ around speaking broken Hindi. \nBut the main attraction is the Ghats.\nA Ghat\
  \ is a flight of stairs, sometimes elongated in shape, to reach down to a water\
  \ body. There are many Ghats around the Lake. I entered through Varah Ghat.\nAs\
  \ you enter the Ghat area, you can\u2019t help but feel enamoured by the profundity\
  \ of peace and the way wind gently caresses the water. Pilgrims can be seen sitting\
  \ cross-legged with their hands folded in a Namaste. There are many holy men in\
  \ this town; Gurus for the knowledge seekers, Pundits for the ritual seekers. But\
  \ I seek nothing of that sort but the experience of this place. \nAs I sat there\
  \ staring at the setting sun turning the water into golden elixir in front of me,\
  \ the sound of Tabla emanating from behind, made the whole scene suddenly more magical.\
  \ A young man, probably in his early 30s, started playing the Indian drum instrument\
  \ with the feel of an evening ritual. Sanskrit mantras were wafting in the air as\
  \ a Pundit was performing evening worship with a few devotees by the water. In the\
  \ distance, a girl took out her hoops and suddenly started dancing as if she was\
  \ in her own world. All of these elements working in their own spaces suddenly found\
  \ a meeting point in my head. I felt light. With my eyes filled with the golden\
  \ sunlight reflecting from the water, the exhaustion evaporated right there. \n\
  They say that magic happens when you look for it, but at that moment I realised\
  \ the true meaning of magic. If it can be put down in words, it is not magic. If\
  \ it doesn\u2019t fill you with the grandness of the universe, it is not magic.\
  \ If it doesn\u2019t take away all the darkness from the inside of you, even if\
  \ momentarily, it is not magic.\nSitting there facing all the light in the world,\
  \ gleaming in the energies of those Sanskrit Mantras, Tabla beats and Dance moves,\
  \ It dawned on me that It is I who was magic. I was the one at the centre of it\
  \ all. I was the Magic, for magic is not what you see, it is what you feel, from\
  \ within."
