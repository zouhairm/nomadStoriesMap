Text: "I opened Google and I typed in \u201CIs Naples\u201D. The first suggestion\
  \ was \u201Csafe\u201D, then \u201Cdangerous\u201D and \u201Cworth visiting\u201D\
  . My grandma currently lives in Naples. Her survival skills are not at a \u201C\
  hunger games\u201D level and she\u2019s never reported any trouble, so I could already\
  \ tell something wasn\u2019t adding up. I called her on the phone and asked her:\
  \ \u201CIf I come visit you in Naples, would you show me around?\u201D. She agreed,\
  \ I am well known for my backrubs skills which is also why I\u2019m her favorite\
  \ niece.\n\nThe journey on the bullet train was very entertaining: most passengers\
  \ wanted to tell me where they were going and they politely enquired as to where\
  \ I was headed. Luckily I wasn\u2019t in a \u201Csilent\u201D carriage and I liked\
  \ the background noise of constant chatting, people on the phone, students reviewing\
  \ out loud. Through the windows I could see the frozen countryside in Turin, the\
  \ vineyards in Tuscany and eventually the Mediterranean.\n\nSix hours later I was\
  \ in Naples and finally hugging my beloved grandma. It was grocery time so our first\
  \ stop was the Fish market. My senses exploded with joy in this place. Everyone\
  \ was shouting the offer of the day, the smell was overwhelming, there was water\
  \ rivering between the cobblestones, people on scooters were flying down these narrow\
  \ streets. I felt like I was attending an extreme rafting lesson while my grandma\
  \ was strolling through all this like the strong woman she is, making deals, waving\
  \ hello. Everyone was calling her \u201Cnonna\u201D, it didn\u2019t matter that\
  \ none of them were actually related. She was loved and taken care of as if she\
  \ was family.\n\nNeeding a break, we stopped for coffee. Of course we drank our\
  \ coffee at the bar, standing, and the barista offered us a glass of water to go\
  \ with it. At the cashier, there is a jar for people who want to pay in advance\
  \ for an extra coffee or \u201Csuspended coffee\u201D. The jar is full. This tradition\
  \ shows another side of the amazing social solidarity in Naples.\n\nI felt safe\
  \ in Naples. In just a couple of hours I could feel the love pouring from the Neapolitans\u2019\
  \ hearts. They were treating me, a complete stranger, like an honorable guest. They\
  \ were pointing at things I needed to see, improvising a map on a piece of tissue,\
  \ escorting me to museums, offering food they wanted me to try. It was obvious they\
  \ loved their city, their culture, their food and I was so grateful they shared\
  \ all of that with me. I didn\u2019t need further convincing though. I knew I was\
  \ in love with Naples on my first bite of Sfogliatella."
