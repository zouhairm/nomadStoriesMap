Text: "I am associated with an UN-based NGO which is headquartered at Tokyo.  I am\
  \ a member of its Indian unit based at Delhi.  Every month the NGO organizes trips\
  \ to Japan for its non-Japanese members. Applications for the visit run in thousands\
  \ every month, of which only thirty two people are selected for each tour. I applied\
  \ for the tour once again, this time, and to my surprise I found my name in the\
  \ list of selected participants out of several thousand applications put across\
  \ the country, which was the last thing I expected. We landed at Narita Airport\
  \ on chilly morning of January. As soon as we went out of the airport, I could feel\
  \ the winter chill.  Apart from the time difference I could feel the huge temperature\
  \ difference, chilling my hands as I didn\u2019t feel the need to pack any gloves\
  \ for the tour. I somehow put my hands in the pockets of my jacket to escape the\
  \ chill. We visited the imperial palace , at the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo. The palace\
  \ was surrounded by huge pool of water on one side and gardens on the other. The\
  \ winter chill could be still be felt on my hands. We took some pictures of our\
  \ group  and then we went to other side of the road where statue of the legendary\
  \ samurai Mashashige stands tall. The whole place resonates with the tales of this\
  \ brave Samurai who fought for his country, engraved in the stone plaques all around\
  \ the statue. It was afternoon by then and the cold chill still had its grip on\
  \ the air. \nIn the evening, we had a Japanese dish, Inarizushi for dinner, which\
  \ are fried tofu balls having fillings of sushi rice. \nIn the subsequent days,\
  \ we visited Kamakura, which is about 45 kilometers from Tokyo, which houses shrines\
  \ of Hachiman, one of the guardian deities of Japan as per the Japanese  Buddhist\
  \ scriptures.  There was a washing area supplied with constant flow of fresh cold\
  \ water from a nearby stream through the stem of a bamboo, the freshness of which\
  \ can be gauged from the sweetness of its taste.\nWe had Tampura in lunch that day,\
  \ which consisted of deep fried vegetables and mixture of shrimp and oysters. The\
  \ Japanese use minimal spices in their cuisines, which sometimes tastes different\
  \ for a person having an Indian palate, however I ordered some spice pouches separately\
  \ and customized the dishes as per my taste.\nWe also enjoyed live snowfall in Japan\
  \ which never enjoyed before in hill stations of India due to high pollution levels.\n\
  I wanted to write more but had to respect the character limit, hence will conclude\
  \ here."
