Text: "We were welcomed with an abrupt wave of heat that assured us we had arrived\
  \ at Bangkok. We stayed in what was called a \u2018boutique service apartment\u2019\
  \ to manage our financial budget. The place was called Ziniza; it had more than\
  \ six floors, with a humble restaurant located on the ground floor. The building\
  \ was coloured with faded white, and had two different entrances that looked similar\
  \ to the entrance of an old Italian casino. The words \u2018Ziniza\u2019 and \u2018\
  welcome\u2019 were written in white with bold capital letters on a dark-red background.\
  \ Our room had a view of a bridge full of Tuk Tuks stacked next to each other. I\
  \ wanted to be away from that twin-bed hotel room. I had no interest in opening\
  \ my travelling bags and dressing my clothes on the shelves. I stood in the middle\
  \ of the room; no, I did not want to sit down. I got dressed in shorts, and wore\
  \ sport shoes. I felt a need to leave \u2013 to explore what is outside. I was going\
  \ to have a long walk, to take pictures of the area, to grab a bite, and to bring\
  \ dinner on my way back. \u2018Where are you going?\u2019 My partner asked. I said,\
  \ \u2018to get us dinner\u2019. It was humid outside, with no company, I walked\
  \ under the sunset. I was walking in a narrowed street. I noticed a green river\
  \ surrounded with green tree bushes on the other side of the street. I kept walking.\
  \ I got closer to that river. I felt itchy. I scratched my legs. I worried that\
  \ a bug might get under my clothes. I scratched my legs once more. I scratched my\
  \ elbows as well. I thought of a bug that might bite my skin. I scratched the back\
  \ of my neck. I scratched my head. I was sweating. The bugs were after me. The green\
  \ swallowed me. I was lost."
