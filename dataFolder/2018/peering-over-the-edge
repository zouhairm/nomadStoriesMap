Text: "We got a late start, and the sun punished us for it. It was about 115\u2109\
  \ at noon, but Sareni insisted. \u201CBest view in Mostar,\u201D he kept repeating.\
  \ \u201CBest view in Bosnia,\u201D he always added. \n\nHe wasn\u2019t wrong. You\
  \ could see all the stone alleyways snake through the grid - beautifully reconstructed\
  \ since the war. But, we came to view Stari Most, the legendary bridge. There wasn\u2019\
  t a single spot in the city where you didn\u2019t see it. If it wasn\u2019t physically\
  \ in view, it was in storefronts, in snow globes or on magnets. Underneath the 80\
  \ foot drop, the Neretva raged a beautiful shade of aqua that rippled with whitecaps.\
  \ With all the commotion of nature and people that encapsulated it - climbing it,\
  \ touching it - it stood stoically like it grew from the land.\n\nLocal men collected\
  \ coins from tourists before jumping. Sareni told us how they ripped off tourists.\
  \ They get you to sign a fake waiver and pay them 10 euros to jump. \n\n\u201CThey\
  \ should pay you!\u201D Sareni said. At this moment, a tourist leaped and nearly\
  \ killed himself. I saw him later that night with a large welt that ran from shoulder\
  \ to waist. It was then our group decided to all do it. \n\nExcept for me. I\u2019\
  d always been afraid of heights, and so I backed out. \n\n\u201CGo to the bank,\u201D\
  \ Sareni said. \u201CIt was a sniper\u2019s nest during the war, and you can see\
  \ the whole valley from it.\u201D I walked towards the bank with my tail between\
  \ my legs.\n\nThe bank looked very Soviet - an imposing grey, brutalist structure.\
  \ When I couldn\u2019t find my way in a drunk vagrant showed me a path around the\
  \ back in the high grass.  \n\nThe sniper\u2019s nest acted as a summit for the\
  \ abandoned bank. There was a single staircase that rose 12 stories with the wall\
  \ noticeably absent. Just a straight drop to the neighbors\u2019 parking lot. Any\
  \ railing on the inside of the stairs had long ago been scrapped. I tried to stay\
  \ in the middle, but a tingling that ran through my spine and shot out my fingers\
  \ and toes made me wobbly. \n\nI focused on the graffiti straight ahead until the\
  \ top floor was an intricate tag of a shell-shocked child in black and white. A\
  \ stark difference from the litany of colors that made up the graffiti on other\
  \ levels.\n \nAfter I looked at the child, I didn\u2019t think. I climbed up on\
  \ the ledge and sat, feet dangling over 100 feet in the air from the sniper\u2019\
  s nest. I admired the view, the vibrant green valley and how from this one spot\
  \ when I leaned my head down and realized that I couldn\u2019t see the bridge, but\
  \ felt like I saw everything."
