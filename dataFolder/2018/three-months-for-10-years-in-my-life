Text: "When I put my feet on the Malagasy soil, I thought that it did not look anything\
  \ like what we can see on television ... During a story programm, we see the images,\
  \ the people walking, the colors of fruits on the market ... But real life, we feel\
  \ it ... We see people and we feel the dust sticking on our face, the stench constantly\
  \ filling our nostrils until we do not even notice it ... When I arrived to do my\
  \ internship on invasive plant management, I thought I would learn a lot about invasive\
  \ plant management. The truth is, I have not really learned about that. When I passed\
  \ the airport, I saw someone waving me. I thought it was my master internship. In\
  \ fact, I stopped 2 seconds and I saw that twenty personnes were making signs ...\
  \ Taxis, of course,what a \nbeginner ! I felt oppressed... And I waited in silence\
  \ for someone to come and get me. Someone came and told me \"go shopping, we leave\
  \ the center only twice a week for shopping !\" So, I went shopping. I took some\
  \ butter and was told \"But why ?There is no fridge because there is no electricity!\"\
  \ This was so obvious for anyone, that I won't get electricity; that nobody told\
  \ me before !\nSo how do you live without electricity? What do you need? In fact,\
  \ I was lost. And if there had not been Lea, another trainee in place for 3 months,\
  \ I would have been in the dark. Because obviously, we do not think about \"how\
  \ to enlighten\" in our way of life. We simply light up. So here I am, the first\
  \ night, in this small dark room, lit by a small candle. With rats running everywhere\
  \ over my ceiling. I had only one desire: to cry and to return.\nNight passed. A\
  \ night punctuated by the noise of the rats above. And the next day, curiously new\
  \ energy seizes me. I can not wait to discover my new way of life for three months...\
  \ And I loved it so much ... Walking 45 minutes in the rainforest to reach the highest\
  \ point of the park and reach out to call my grandfather and wish him a happy birthday,\
  \ it gives meaning to life. Meet kids, who are already working and who keep a smile\
  \ to their ears as soon as they say hello. I always wondered where this strength\
  \ came from? They earn \u20AC 2 a day and yet they seem to live more than others.\
  \ \nYes I learned. Nothing that can be learned in books. I learned life. I learned\
  \ that people are happy even if they do not know what to eat the next day. I have\
  \ learned to love life as they love it : without ever know what tomorrow will bring.\
  \ When my feet touched the French soil, I realized that I had won 10 years in my\
  \ head and memories for eternity !"
