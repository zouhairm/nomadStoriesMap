Text: "When you ride hundredth time by train Kiev - Lviv home, then a little bit of\
  \ what's happening in the car can distract you from reading the book, and even more\
  \ surprising. But that day was an exception. The married couple sitting opposite\
  \ me was not at all ordinary.  I couldn't help but overhear a few phrases from their\
  \ conversation and realized that they were traveling a lot. When they began to discuss\
  \ Donetsk, I exclaimed: \" Have you traveled all over the country?\" The man smiled\
  \ and said: \"Of course not, we traveled half the world.\" My first question was:\
  \ \"Why are you traveling so much?\" This time, the woman answered me: \"Mark Twain\
  \ said that only two things we\u2019ll regret on deathbed \u2013 that we are a little\
  \ loved and little traveled.\"\nWe talked all evening. I was struck by their story\
  \ that every summer they spend a week in the Carpathians, live in tents, walk and\
  \ enjoy nature. It was that moment when I made a decision that changed my life.\
  \ I decided immediately go to the Carpathians. This decision pushed me to the edge,\
  \ after which I could no longer live without traveling.\nAs soon as I arrived home,\
  \ I bought a ticket to the Carpathians. I chose the cheapest tour, which included\
  \ only a shuttle. I didn\u2019t know what I would eat the next three days and where\
  \ I would live, but I had a premonition that something awesome awaits me.\nThe next\
  \ morning we were near Maniavsky waterfall. It was so beautiful that I wanted to\
  \ stay there live. The waterfall is located in a picturesque valley, among the high\
  \ mountains, surrounded by fir-beech forest. The water chuted from a height of twenty\
  \ meters and hyaline drops constantly rolled along the rocks.\nI needed a place\
  \ to stay and my new friend Anna said she will never leave me without shelter in\
  \ a foreign village, so I spent that night in hers house with her family. I was\
  \ really impressed by the hospitality of people in this region.\nThe next day my\
  \ cherished dream came true, I climbed to the highest point of Ukraine - Mount Hoverla.\
  \ The trek was really difficult, after a few hours my legs became very tired, with\
  \ every step it was harder to breathe, but all of this worth it. The view was so\
  \ fantastic, so I couldn't believe it.  The blue peaks of the mountains, high hills\
  \ and valleys charmed me. At the moment when you're on top, you feel like a winner,\
  \ as if just win all possible competitions.\nOnly after this trip, I got a real\
  \ taste of life. I visited a lot of wonderful places and hopefully things will keep\
  \ getting better."
