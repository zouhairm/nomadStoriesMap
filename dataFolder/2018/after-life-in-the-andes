Text: "There I was, about to start my hike into Huaytapallana, an 18,000 ft mountain,\
  \ in the middle of Peru.\n\nOur trek began and at our first break we made a traditional\
  \ offering to Pachamama, a tribute to Mother Earth. This is ancient ritual in which\
  \ you have to ask permission, to ascend and to get back safely, whilst at the same\
  \ time you ask for something personal in return, like a miracle.\n\nI decided to\
  \ play along with the tradition and have a sincere and meaningful talk with Pachamama.\n\
  \nCathartic is the right word to describe this episode of soul searching. Laughter,\
  \ regret, joy, sadness, a literal roller coaster of emotions came by me to the point\
  \ to where I was not crying, but literally sobbing, in the healthiest way possible\
  \ I was letting everything go, this was absolutely the most amazing experience I've\
  \ had so far.\n\nAfter an emotional breakdown and hours of intense hike, I reached\
  \ my point of no-return so I decided to turn around and made my walk back to the\
  \ car while my friends kept going.\n\nHowever, the walk backdown turned out to be\
  \ the hardest part, I was having high altitude sickness and it became so strong\
  \ to the point I couldn't walk anymore the sun was going down and the fog was rolling\
  \ in, soon realized, I was done, this was me against nature.\n\nA sudden peace came\
  \ and swept me away then I remembered all that talk that I had with Pachamama earlier\
  \ and how completely happy and thankful I was for everything in my life and if that\
  \ was my time to go, I was completely OK with it.\n\nThen I had a personal request\
  \ and asked Pachamama that if she let me live another day, I promised I would do\
  \ my best to become a better person in every way that I can.\n\nThe fog settled\
  \ for a minute that was my cue, Pachamama had listen, suddenly my strength came\
  \ back, got back up and rushed to the car, quickly turned around to say thanks and\
  \ to take the best picture I've ever taken.\n\nFinally saw my friends they were\
  \ waiting for my by the car, but how? They didn\u2019t past me on their way back,\
  \ turns out just half a mile ahead from where I quit the climb, there was another\
  \ path, an easy way down, but feeling re-born after accepting that could have been\
  \ my last day alive, just hugged them and head back to the city to eat and have\
  \ hard-earned beer. \n\nIt's been a while and I have yet to go back and pay my respects,\
  \ after all I asked for something and got it, so I do owe a visit to Pachamama,\
  \ but I\u2019m not sure that I\u2019ve grown enough as I promised I would, but hopefully\
  \ someday, I will."
