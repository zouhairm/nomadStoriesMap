Text: "\u201CAre you here for the tour?\u201D\n\nI peered up. I was unhappy to lay\
  \ eyes on a fellow Brit. My hangover and I had been enjoying the welcome seclusion\
  \ that a city like Berlin offers a lone suffering non German speaker.\n\n\u201C\
  What tour?\u201D My gravelly voice. I had recently emerged from Berlin\u2019s loud,\
  \ glittering network of nightlife.\n\n\u201CSyrian refugees will draw parallels\
  \ between Berlin\u2019s history and Syria\u2019s.\u201D Such a perky voice. \u201C\
  I should\u2019ve thought you\u2019d be here for it. It starts at Mohrenstrasse station\
  \ at three.\u201D\n\nI peered down at my phone, cradled purely for procrastination\
  \ purposes. It read 3.01pm. I squinted at the sign besides me. It read Mohrenstrasse\
  \ station.\n\nMy head was pounding like a Berghain bassline, but my plans to curl\
  \ up on a cafe couch would have to wait. Fate had spoken.\n\n\u201COkay, let me\
  \ just grab a coffee.\u201D\n\nThrough shiny glass ad the whir of my latte\u2019\
  s construction, I watched a stout man approach my new companion. They exchanged\
  \ pleasantries. An artsy youth with vacant eyes breezed over as I returned fancy\
  \ latte in hand.\n\nFrom beneath his dusty black facial hair the \u2018Syrian refugee\u2019\
  \ sombrely led us around the city. His voice plodded like his feet as he reacquainted\
  \ us with the city within which we stood. He sketched out the story of refugees\
  \ who had stood in our place before and still stand around us. Curiosity overcame\
  \ me and my \u2018suffering\u2019 flushed pink and fell away.\n\n\u201CAre there\
  \ refugees on the streets?\u201D I asked from above the delicious heaped platter\
  \ at the final stop, a modest Syrian restaurant decorated by gorgeous food and welcoming\
  \ people. \n\n\u201CNo, no, the German\u2019s are kind. They provide beds and subsistence.\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CWhy are so many people on the streets?\u201D \n\n\u201CBy choice.\u201D\
  \ the cool young Scandinavian explained, \u201Cmy friends live on the streets, They\
  \ are artists.\u201D\n\nThe airy artists\u2019 friends sleep on streets and in squats.\
  \ They don\u2019t work or accept medical care. They want to avoid \u2018the system\u2019\
  \ and \u2018being on paper\u2019. The Syrian refugees come from streets they can\u2019\
  t sleep on for soldiers. They graciously accept beds in forgotten corners of the\
  \ city, unable to work due to their status.\n\nI sobered up earlier that day with\
  \ empty pockets, unsure why I was stumbling down a quaint country road in the suburbs\
  \ of the city at sunrise. I sat besides the city workers on the subway armed with\
  \ sturdy breakfast beer bottles and complaints about the refugee crisis. Our decadence\
  \ seems so sharply insipid.\n\nWhat a myriad of mindscapes Berlin has for your eyes\
  \ to peer upon."
