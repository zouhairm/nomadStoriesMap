Text: "The duvet was pulled up to my chin. I teetered at the edge of the queen bed,\
  \ fully clothed under the covers in a plaid shirt, jeans and running shoes. Adrenaline\
  \ kept my eyes pried open, piercing the bare, faded ceiling with anticipation. I\
  \ had lay awake all night. The cool, gentle light of dawn swept across my face.\
  \ I would be ready when the time came.\n\u201CStay indoors. Do not go outside.\u201D\
  \ \nThose were my program supervisor\u2019s instructions from the day before. My\
  \ iPad lay nestled beside me. A news headline flashed on the screen, casting the\
  \ dark, tense bedroom in a small eerie glow.\n\u201CIsraeli Airstrike Kills Hamas\
  \ Military Chief Ahmed Jabari.\u201D\nEveryone knew what this meant\u2014what was\
  \ headed our way. We knew what was imminent.\n\u201CStay Indoors. Do not go outside.\u201D\
  \ \nAs a volunteer from the States, I had never heard the red siren before\u2014\
  the blaring Tseva Adom (Hebrew for \u2018Red Alert\u2019) which sounds throughout\
  \ the cities of Israel during a state of emergency. My imagination tangled with\
  \ the possibilities. How loud was it? Would I even be able to hear it? I would know\
  \ soon enough the reality of living in a small, Southern city 3 miles of Gaza and\
  \ being in range of rocket fire.\nAs dawn broke, my eyelids grew heavy and my body\
  \ finally surrendered, melting into the silence. \nAnd that's when it happened.\
  \ The sound of the Tseva Adom rose and fell in a haunting crescendo across the city.\
  \ I leaped out of bed, and my housemate Vlad shouted across the hall \u201CGuys\
  \ get up! Let\u2019s go!\u201D We had 30 seconds to make it to the shelter before\
  \ impact. Scrambling out the side door and into the backyard, we sprinted towards\
  \ our neighbor\u2019s house where the \u2018saferoom\u2019 was. As the siren rose\
  \ and fell around us, I saw a stream of white smoke shoot overhead\u2014the path\
  \ of a projectile rocket. Our neighbor, a middle-aged Israeli woman, stood at the\
  \ doorway\u2014but she was smiling behind crinkled, vivacious eyes. She held a tray\
  \ of water cups as we we bolted into the house, each of us grabbing one as we passed\
  \ like runners in a relay. Over heavy breaths and sips of water, we heard and felt\
  \ the explosions, both near and far. One was two blocks away, another was on the\
  \ outer skirts of our small city. \nWhen the siren waned and everyone spoke, I remained\
  \ silent. My body was still visibly shaking. Our neighbor, relaxed and collected,\
  \ handed me an anti-anxiety pill. She put her hand on my shoulder, grinning. In\
  \ a thick Israeli accent she said to me, \u201CAre you fine yet? Your students will\
  \ be in class waiting for you.\u201D"
