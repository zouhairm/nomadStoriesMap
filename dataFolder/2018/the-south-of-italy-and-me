Text: "I\u2019m going to tell you the story of southern Italy, the Napoli area. Famous\
  \ for the mystery of mafias, the disordered cities and the unacceptable working\
  \ efficiency, many people fell hard to get into this area. However, if you ever\
  \ visited the south, you\u2019ll definitely love here and even stay here forever,\
  \ just like what I did. The life in the south is just so fascinating: the sea, the\
  \ lovely sunshine weather, the wind of Mediterranean, the flowers on those beautiful\
  \ islands, the coastal highway and delicious food. So, my stop is Napoli, when we\
  \ talk about the local connection here, the environment is also a great entrance,\
  \ including the sea, food and people.\nThe first connection I made was terrible:\
  \ I lost. But the color of its sea is amazing. The white from birds, the blue from\
  \ sky, the butter color from mountains, and the grey from the wall.Oh, and probably\
  \ also a little bit green, from the plants and flowers, while the sunshine covered\
  \ all of us by sending forth some charming golden waves. \nThat was a day of April,\
  \ I asked some local people where is the best place to overlook the city. I met\
  \ so many people on this small adventure and intruded so many times into the private\
  \ gardens of others. However, every time I lost my way, there were always some people\
  \ trying to help, that was really impressive. \nFrom the old town I started another\
  \ try of making local connection. The locals are so proud of their pizza, they would\
  \ like to share the details of making and eating pizza and in the end, guided you\
  \ to their favorite pizzeria. After a bite of pizza, probably you could make friends\
  \ with people who sit next to you by saying: mamma m\xEDa! Che buona! The food was\
  \ a perfect bridge to connect them and me, during the conversation I got a lot of\
  \ travel tips which were useful in my following journey and they were also quite\
  \ interested in my culture perhaps the magical oriental world appeared only on TV\
  \ and books. \nThe first journey of Napoli is just so short, but when I came back\
  \ after two years, the familiar scene just appeared automatically in my mind: the\
  \ time flies, but it stays in Napoli. I jumped directly into a \u201Cresident\u201D\
  \ and became part of the local. In this way, the connection between local part and\
  \ me was built fast and stable. So, ppen your mouth to share, be curious and brave\
  \ about the new environment, be open to accept different opinions, and the most\
  \ important is: don\u2019t consider yourself as an stranger! That is my secret of\
  \ making local connections."
