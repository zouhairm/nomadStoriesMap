Text: "The moment I stepped foot outside Santos Demont, I was consumed with happiness.\
  \ I had just flown in from S\xE3o Paulo- a vast plane of cement, sprinkled with\
  \ skyscrapers- and I was excited for the change of atmosphere. Sunshine brushed\
  \ over my cheekbones and into my soul. In the distance, Christ the Redeemer stood\
  \ proudly over the city. I had finally made it to Rio De Janeiro, and for the next\
  \ several days I found myself immersed in a colorful, eccentric culture unlike anything\
  \ I had experienced before. The hotel was in walking distance to the center of Rio,\
  \ making for a relaxing stroll our first night in the city. We walked into an old\
  \ theater and watched as contemporary dancers glided atop its wooden floors. Upstairs,\
  \ hidden amongst a jungle of hanging plants, an art class was being held. The teacher\
  \ wore her hair long down her back, where it turned into an ocean filled with black\
  \ and silver waves. When her eyes met mine, a smile spread across her face, deepening\
  \ the lines that framed her full lips. She came to meet us in the entryway, explaining\
  \ the content of her course. My boyfriend explained that my understanding of Portuguese\
  \ was limited, and without hesitation the instructor hugged me, kissed my cheek\
  \ and welcomed me to Rio.One thing to know when traveling to Brazil is that Brazilians\
  \ are notoriously affectionate. Upon meeting, it is custom to receive a peck on\
  \ the cheek, as well as a warm embrace. Coming from the Midwest, a polite greeting\
  \ consists of a stiff handshake - anything more would be intrusive to personal space.\
  \ But here in Rio, up close and personal was the only way to interact. When we returned\
  \ to our hotel, we noticed an alley lined with small bars adjacent to the front\
  \ of the building. People from all walks of life flooded the cobble-stone alley\
  \ in an impromptu block party; couples kissed passionately in the moonlight, friends\
  \ shared laughs over beers, and I was in love with all of it. There was no pressure\
  \ to conform, and uniqueness was celebrated. When my weekend in Rio came to an end,\
  \ it was saddening to walk away from a city that had so much more to offer. The\
  \ people here were exuberant and full of love, and even through hardships the city\
  \ was filled with passion. When flying over the city I let myself get one last glimpse;\
  \ not only had Rio shown me beautiful scenery, it showed me the many beautiful people\
  \ that lived their life with joy and love in their hearts. The city was alive and\
  \ it was contagious."
