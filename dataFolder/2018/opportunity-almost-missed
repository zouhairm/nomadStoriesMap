Text: "The sound of someone saying \"Hola como estas\" awoke me. When I remembered\
  \ where I was, I pretended to still be asleep. Those pesky vendors had been hounding\
  \ me all morning.   \n\nI arrived in Cuba the previous evening and the first thing\
  \ I did on this first morning in paradise was leave the confines of the resort.\
  \ I waited a long time for a bus that should've arrived at 10:15 but didn't arrive\
  \ until 11:05. Buses are habitually late in Cuba.  My first taste of local culture.\
  \  In Varadero, I hit the beach and eventually found a shaded area to take a midday\
  \ nap.  \n\n\"You from Canada?\" the voice continued. \"I like Canada. You speak\
  \ only English?\" he asked as I became increasingly annoyed. I opened an eye to\
  \ get a look at my visitor. A tall, slender man of about 20 stood with his hand\
  \ out waiting for me to extend mine. \"Yes I'm from Canada\" I said. He then spoke\
  \ in Spanish and when I said I didn't understand, he looked at me strangely. That's\
  \ when I realized the only thing he knew in English were those few phrases he had\
  \ spoken. My attempt to speak Spanish drew laughter and like it was meant to be,\
  \ we became quick friends.\n\nFor hours, we communicated via sign language and drawings\
  \ in the sand. It's surprising how much can be exchanged between two people who\
  \ cannot verbally understand one another! I learned that he was from Matanzas and\
  \ took the bus to the beach to sell souvenirs. I learned about life in Cuba and\
  \ his dreams of traveling the world. He learned about life in Canada, snow, Facebook\
  \ and various things that Cubans only heard of. I learned some Spanish. He learned\
  \ some English.  \n\nI felt sad when we hugged and parted ways. An interrupted nap\
  \ that turned into a conversation with a young man on a beach in Varadero, Cuba\
  \ remains, to this day, the most interesting conversation I've ever had."
