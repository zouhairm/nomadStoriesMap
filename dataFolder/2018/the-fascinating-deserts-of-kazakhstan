Text: "Hello. My name is Said. I am from Uzbekistan. My homeland is one of the most\
  \ historical places in the world. But now I want to tell not about my Uzbekistan,\
  \ but about glorious and attractive Kazakhstan. \nMy trip begins with my student\
  \ life. I am an international student. Study in Russian Federation. After the end\
  \ of my first bachelor course I needed to return to my homeland. Icould bought a\
  \ ticket for airplane, but at first I wanted to save my money and secondly wanted\
  \ to travel around Kazakhstan.  We agreed with the taxi driver and he promised to\
  \ take us to Uzbekistan. And with it started my journey to Kazakhstan. My story\
  \ is not about its history, climate, and not about its economy. My story is about\
  \ Kazakhstan's attractive desert nature. \nAt 5.00 pm we began our trip and on the\
  \ next morning when I woke up, opened my eyes, we allready had crossed the border\
  \ of Kazakhstan, and then I saw my dream, the Kazakhstan's attractive deserts in\
  \ my real life. When I looked around I swa only sand and felt very hot desert climate.\
  \ There is nobody except us, only sand and sun and the brilliant sky of Kazakhstan.\
  \ The sandly mountains were very fantastic and fascinating . In both sides of the\
  \ road were many and many heards of camels. They were very hungry and maybe thirsty.\
  \ Pay attention! When you want to travel around Kazakhstan or around any type of\
  \ Asian deserts you need to remember that when you drive your car during night time\
  \ you must drive very carefully. Because every camel likes to sleep on the asphalt\
  \ road. Because of this you need to drive below 100 km/h . If you get hungry on\
  \ Kazakhstan's deserts, don't worry , you meet cute, national kazakh cafes on every\
  \ 50 kms. And their meals are very very sweet and kazakh girls are too. Their national\
  \ dress, their beauty and their relationship astonishes everybody. Along the road\
  \ the taxi driver showed us one of places which I have never met in my life. It\
  \ was only a spring and ats water. At first the spring didn't surprise me, but when\
  \ you drink its water you understand all. The water was very very cold. But I liked\
  \ it. Because the weather was +38 *C . The magic of that spring is, when you drink\
  \ its water just after the outdoor bottle , it is cold, but you drink it only after\
  \ one or two minutes it will be hot.Then I thought about magican nature of deserts.\
  \ And we continued our trip. I was tired, and the weather appealt me to sleep. And\
  \ again when I opened my eyes , It was my love, my homeland Uzbekistan, my dear\
  \ museum under the sky - Bukhara."
