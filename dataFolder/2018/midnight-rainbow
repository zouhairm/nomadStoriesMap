Text: "We all know the cliche saying \u201Cthe best things come when you least expect\
  \ them.\u201D Maybe it\u2019s some sort of magic that happens when everything seems\
  \ dull and dark around us, or maybe these \u201Cbest things\u201D are the things\
  \ we ignore when we are not looking in the right direction at the right time.  It\
  \ was a freezing night in March, when I decided to skip my cozy, uneventful movie\
  \ night and venture out to the icy port. I was finally living in the country of\
  \ my dreams, Iceland, why on earth had I even considered staying in on such a clear\
  \ night! After convincing my companion to drive me to the port, I set up my camera\
  \ equipment at the beach and sat on the chilly beach. The hours went by, and it\
  \ became more and more difficult to make my companion stay and not think of that\
  \ warm bed. Once in a while I would let out a gasp at the sight of any light in\
  \ the horizon to keep the excitement up. \u201CCome on let\u2019s go, we\u2019ve\
  \ waited for too long\u201D, my friend friend sighed. And as if these were the magic\
  \ words needed, the aurora appeared out of nowhere. It looked like someone had just\
  \ turned the switch off and suddenly back on! The few people who were left at the\
  \ beach started cheering. But nobody had prepared us for what happened next. The\
  \ aurora moved from the fjords towards us, until it was right above us. The colors\
  \ changed from green to purple and pink. We all let out a scream at the same time\
  \ when the aurora appeared to be exploding, like a cosmic firework. We were looking\
  \ at a so-called \u201Ccrown\u201D, and the whole spectacle was an aurora storm.\
  \ My icelandic friend exclaimed \u201CI\u2019ve been living here for so long, how\
  \ come I have never seen this?\u201D. We all felt connected, we were all witnesses\
  \ of this out-of-this-world-event. It is safe to say it was the purest joy I have\
  \ felt in my life, and judging by the smiles on everyones faces, the couples holding\
  \ hands tightly, the tender hugs between friends, I thought that we all realised\
  \ how precious life is and the people that are by our side to share the magic with\
  \ us."
