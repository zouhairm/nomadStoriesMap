Text: "I stand under the shade of a quaking aspen, the countless little leaves trembling\
  \ in the breeze with a light, rippling sound so distinct to their kind. Their shared\
  \ root system has inspired scientist and onlooker alike as they dominate the mountainside\u2014\
  a single, verdant organism.\n\nBut this life cresting the rocky slope is merely\
  \ the most visible, not the most ancient. Only recently have traces of ancient,\
  \ microscopic life been detected in the strata underfoot, our earliest ancestors\
  \ from billions of years ago.\n\nStanding at over 13,000 feet, it\u2019s hard to\
  \ imagine that these roughly carved slopes were once bathed in warm ocean water\
  \ and filled with life. Fossils hide in the rock of these mountains, shelled pioneers\
  \ so alien to the life we know that they surpass description. Cambrian formations\
  \ tell a story of Earth\u2019s first predators who, along with an organically oxygenated\
  \ planet, fueled an explosion of diverse life that would one day lead to planes\
  \ and smartphones.\n\nBut the Uintas are quiet now. Late Spring ice spreads its\
  \ frosty fingers over stones, carving boulders without a sound. Streams trickle\
  \ into glacially formed ponds, glossy strands of silver where long fronds of grass\
  \ dip for a drink. Tall stalks of flowers pierce through the tough soil, crowned\
  \ with crimson petals and aptly named Indian Paintbrushes.\n\nAs I walk up the mountainside,\
  \ these meadows become sparse, conifers taking the place of aspens. When I turn\
  \ around to see how far the trail has taken me, the landscape collapses into a patchwork\
  \ of ponds encompassed in the crowns of pine trees.\n\nThe air is pure, thin and\
  \ crisp\u2014more biting than a mint. Peaceful as these mountains are, I know this\
  \ landscape will change again, perhaps sooner than I think. It has more surprises\
  \ in store for me once I go down the trail and try another, but as I catch my breath\
  \ and marvel at the view, time is lost on me just for a moment."
