Text: "Nestled in the mountains some 60 miles outside Bosnia and Herzegovina\u2019\
  s capital lies Vlasenica, the birthplace of my mother. Clay roofed houses line the\
  \ narrow, unpaved streets, where grandmothers in headscarves walk home with freshly\
  \ baked bread in their aprons, their tired backs hunched over with the burden of\
  \ feeding their families. No matter where you are, the view is painted with rolling\
  \ hills and roasting pigs. Rakija is passed around after each meal to help digest\
  \ the paprika\u0161 that was force-fed to you by relatives who think anything less\
  \ than nauseatingly-full is starving. \n\nI remember walking down dirt roads, children\
  \ running after me and shouting, \u201CIt\u2019s Stephanie, from America!\u201D\
  \ the stray dogs they cared for not far behind. My second, third, fourth cousins\
  \ and I climbed trees, stuffed our bellies with dried meats, and begged our baba\
  \ for bombona. My aunts would brush my hair, buy me gifts with money they didn\u2019\
  t have, and insist I sleep in their beds. They loved me. To them, I was just as\
  \ much at home as they were.\n\nBut my recent trips back have been tarnished by\
  \ my political awareness. Years of heinous warfare left many Yugoslavs with rigid\
  \ Nationalist views. Vlasenica\u2019s population shifted from majority Muslim (55.3%)\
  \ in 1991, to majority Serb (66.5%) in 2013. A Serbian Orthodox church ominously\
  \ stands in the center of town, while an empty plot of land is the unholy eyesore\
  \ of a bombed mosque. Strike up a conversation with anyone and you\u2019ll likely\
  \ find yourself two hours later, and two pivos later, in an indignant debate about\
  \ who did it. Whomever you\u2019re talking to, it wasn\u2019t their fault.\n\nThe\
  \ truth is hard to find when trauma leaves no room for logic. My baba calls Vlasenica\
  \ our land, but fails to acknowledge its very obvious shift in ownership. She was\
  \ after all, a refugee of the Balkan Wars; she too, lost everything.\n\nA place\
  \ that once felt like home now feels alien, shattered by a culture of silence and\
  \ a family that feigns ignorance. Though my life was very much shaped by my Yugo\
  \ heritage, the country\u2019s undoing feels like an accident I witnessed from a\
  \ passing car, protected by glass. But glass breaks. Of course I wasn\u2019t there\
  \ for the war, but I\u2019ve put together bits and pieces of narratives tainted\
  \ by a sort of bias only made possible by severe suffering. In Vlasenica, I\u2019\
  m reminded that I hold the highest level of privilege\u2014taking from my heritage\
  \ all the good and not bearing the guilt of the bad, a daughter and foreigner of\
  \ my country."
