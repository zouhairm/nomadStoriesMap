Text: "Today is our first 40km walk. As I have already many km in my legs, I know\
  \ this will be a hard day. Nevertheless I jump out of my sleeping back, pack my\
  \ big and my small luggage and crab something to eat. We are on our way to Kampala,\
  \ Uganda and I can't wait to move on.\nHustle in the morning is usual. Everyone\
  \ has to throw their tents and luggages on the truck, so that we can start walking\
  \ at 9am. We are around 25 walkers from Uganda and Germany. My first good feeling\
  \ changes really quick. After a few kilometers I feel that I get some blisters and\
  \ my heel hurts like hell, I am bleeding. As I don't want to whine, I keep going.\
  \ I am happy as heaven when I realize I am in flight mode, but wait! There is someone\
  \ who needs a break. So we stop and my groin is pumping. I didn't knew that exists.\
  \ Well, best medicine for now is smiling the pain away and I try to talk with as\
  \ many people as possible. There is a lot to talk about. Uganda is beautiful. We\
  \ are walking through South-East where everything is full of plants. So many pineapples\
  \ and potatoes. My eyes can't get enough of this beauty. \nOkay, let's walk again.\
  \ It's rainy season and I feel the first drops peeling down my face. This day will\
  \ really test my strength. Pulling over my rain poncho while walking, I look down\
  \ my feet. I am wearing my sneakers today, because the road wasn't that bad. This\
  \ is definitely a mistake. I am slipering in my shoes. \nAfter 8hours of walking\
  \ in rain and hot sun, we finally reach the base camp and the pain rolls over my\
  \ body. I am not able to move anymore. I sit down in front of our kitchen tent -\
  \ shadow is more than welcome. I am suffering! Yes, I do. At this point, I call\
  \ me crazy to go on this adventure.\nLooking up, there are 5 girls sitting in front\
  \ of me. One tries to take of my shoes, another one tries to give me a massage.\
  \ It feels more like stroking. But damn it is so unbelievable careful. Tears almost\
  \ come up. I start chatting with the girls, as possible. They can't speak englisch\
  \ really well, so it is more a simple conversation. \nThis reaction of empathy blew\
  \ my pain away. Seeing someone else, is such a kind gesture. Together we built up\
  \ my tent. They never did it, for sure, but they copy me and together we managed\
  \ it. I share my cookies with them and the girls smile from ear to ear. Meanwhile\
  \ they touch my blonde hair and my freckled skin. I know these kids really taught\
  \ me a lesson today and I am blessed. My pain is still there, but it isn't that\
  \ important."
