Text: "The directions said, \"Past the town, through the banana fields, to the end\
  \ of the beach, turn left at the Virgin Mary\". There, my Panamanian paradise awaits\
  \ me. There was no mention of military checkpoints.\n\nThe tiny mudskipper plane\
  \ skimmed the turquoise sea as we landed on the single runway in Puerto Obald\xED\
  a. I wandered over to a room with \"Migraci\xF3n\" painted on the wall. The sign\
  \ read Closed until 1:00. It was already 1:30, according to my dying phone. Another\
  \ hour passed; my stomach growled; the immigration officer returned. He stamped\
  \ a new page and pointed me to the port. There I could catch the launch.\n \nThe\
  \ captain packed the boat full. The engine revved and a woman sitting beside me\
  \ started to cry. We slammed into rough waves with the force of a sledgehammer.\
  \ I felt my spine cracking as I exchanged a commiserating smile with the crying\
  \ woman. Finally, the launch arrived. I scrambled off the boat, grabbing my soaked\
  \ pack. Waving goodbye, I started to walk. \"Past the town, through the banana fields\u2026\
  \" and straight into two soldiers. \n \nDressed in camouflage with guns slung over\
  \ their shoulders, they speak in quick, syncopated words. I try to catch familiar\
  \ words but can\u2019t. One of the men shuffles to me. Pasaporte, he bellows expectantly.\
  \ I reach into my bag and hand it to him, forcing my fingers to let go. \n\nBut\
  \ there is some miscommunication about my passport. The two soldiers are bickering\
  \ now, flicking through the pages roughly. I hear the sound of tearing paper and\
  \ shudder. One of them radios through a walkie-talkie. We wait for a response.\n\
  \nNothing. The man disappears between banana trees, taking my passport with him.\
  \ Contemplating the last sips in my water bottle, I resign myself to spending the\
  \ rest of my days sitting on this wobbly bench. There is a tap on my shoulder. Soldier\
  \ #1 extends his arm to offer me a pack of cookies. I take them greedily, only briefly\
  \ wondering if he has poisoned them.\n\nSoldier #2 returns, smiling significantly.\
  \ Or maybe it\u2019s just the cookies filling my stomach. Calling out to us, he\
  \ starts to sing. I vaguely wonder if I am hallucinating. But no, he is still singing\
  \ as he ambles over and presents my fully intact passport. \"Good, you go now,\"\
  \ he barks in brusque English. Pulling me to my feet, he leads me to a clearing.\
  \ A beautiful crescent strip of sand runs the length of the shore. At the far end\
  \ I can see a 10-meter tall statue. La virgen, I hear him say as I walk towards\
  \ salvation. Indeed, it feels like a miracle."
