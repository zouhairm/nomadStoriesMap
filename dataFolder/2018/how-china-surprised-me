Text: "At the very beginning of all my travels, I never know what I'm going to experience.\
  \ What I do is always influenced by the very moment: who I meet, what I see and\
  \ what I feel of course. Every trip ends up being completely different from how\
  \ it was planned to be, so it always becomes an adventure. And that's exactly what\
  \ happened last summer. \nI went East for the first time in my life. Yes, I flew\
  \ to China. To be honest, this nation wasn't on the top of my list, but I couldn't\
  \ miss the opportunity to go there, so I grabbed it. I didn't know anything, nor\
  \ the language nor people's traditions. Should I be honest? I didn't know what China\
  \ really means. Besides that, I packed and left quite excited cause enthusiasm never\
  \ leaves me alone. \nAfter a not so appealing red-eye flight playing solo Tetris\
  \ on my seat screen, I landed in Beijing and I finally got to hit the arrivals floor.\n\
  I just felt like it was a different world because everything seemed so unusual,\
  \ that's banal to say, but no words can express that feeling.\nFirst impressions\
  \ are not always right they say, correct? Wrong this time. From there to the end\
  \ of my journey it came out that what I felt was completely true. It didn't take\
  \ long that everything started to appear almost normal. The first ni hao came easier\
  \ than I thought and so the first conversation with a rare English speaker. The\
  \ main suggestion I can give to people now is to speak and ask locals as much as\
  \ they can because that's what they'll retain once home. I can't even tell how many\
  \ curious facts I learnt by talking to people. In the end, I realized that Chinese\
  \ culture fascinates me. \nDid you know that a lot of wives work in the cities to\
  \ send money to their husbands' families that are carrying their children? Interesting,\
  \ isn't it?\nApparently and for most of the things I saw, I could have said that\
  \ China's situation is not that prosperous. But besides her hard to comprehend ancient\
  \ traditions, the strict regime and multitude situations of misery, the way people\
  \ behave amazed me. They are totally into the future, they know what technology\
  \ is and they're part of it. They have their network and isolate themselves in a\
  \ virtual world, that's just China, nothing else. I left my country with an idea\
  \ that evolved and changed completely. \nThat's why I define this a real journey,\
  \ in fact, it's not predictable and what it comes out at the end goes beyond the\
  \ expectations. Travels could be about everything, but this time it was a travel\
  \ about people."
