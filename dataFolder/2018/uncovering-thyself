Text: "When I stepped out of my comfort zone, into an unknown space, I didn't know\
  \ what will happen. \nI was shy enough to open myself to anything new. I wished\
  \ to stay in a cocoon as I hadn't tasted the light.\nI suddenly met a diversity\
  \ of people. I was uncomfortable at first, finding my place in the crowd. \n\nIn\
  \ this place called Dungarpur in India, where I was doing Gandhi Fellowship, I had\
  \ to live in the villages for four months! When this information traveled till my\
  \ ears, I was ready to quit. It was out of my imagination coming from a city. Then,\
  \ a newly made friend held my hand, and said, \"try it first and then if you don't\
  \ like it, leave it.\" I thought, not a bad idea. \n\nWhen this whole process of\
  \ village immersion as we called it, started, I was probably the most excited one.\
  \ I was now excited about getting my hand into something that tried before. The\
  \ villagers spoke a different language from what I spoke. But, that didn't become\
  \ a stopping point. Rather, it made me learn Wagri from the local people themselves.\
  \ They laughed at me when I didn't understand. So, I would ask the kids to translate\
  \ it in Hindi. \nIt was mesmerizing to stay like a family with absolutely unknown\
  \ people. Their kids played with me, we learnt together, we drew together, we danced\
  \ together and what not.  \nIf I was to visit somewhere in the village for the project\
  \ I was pursuing, the kids would accompany every time. They made sure I was safe\
  \ enough. \n\nOnce, I was on my tour around the village, during the lunch time.\
  \ It had become late and I had no place to have lunch at. \nThere appeared a lady,\
  \ I had never met or seen her before. She came towards me and asked, \"Madame, have\
  \ you had lunch?\" \nI replied by saying no. \nIt felt as if she came as an angle\
  \ just to feed me. She took me to her house, cleaned it and cooked. She didn't have\
  \ flour to make bread, but she borrowed it from her neighbor. She poured her love\
  \ for an unknown girl. She wanted nothing in return. I didn't have anything to give\
  \ for a gesture like this as well. Anything I would give, felt small. I could only\
  \ think of lending my ears to her as she released her anguish towards her extended\
  \ family. She stayed alone with minimal support and financial help. \nYet, her love\
  \ still travels with me wherever I go. I make sure I give love in the same way she\
  \ did. I got to see a new way of connecting genuinely. The light out the cocoon\
  \ tasted like freedom because of people like this woman. \nThere's magic in faith,\
  \ I learnt."
