Text: "\"He will be waiting for you at the airport. Look for the man wearing a yellow\
  \ Armani t-shirt\", Hajiba, our Air Bnb host informed us in her last email. I sighed,\
  \ closed my laptop and thumbed over the dog eared pages in my Fodor's \"Morocco\
  \ Travel Guide\", re-reading the \"Simple Phrases\" paragraphs over and over again.\
  \ \n\nWe arrived to Rabat and security ushered us to the \"Arrivals\" section of\
  \ the airport where sure enough, we spotted the man with the the yellow Armani shirt.\
  \ As we made our way towards him, he began eagerly waving and smiling at us, as\
  \ if we were long lost cousins coming to visit. \n\n\"Bonjour! I am Guy, welcome\
  \ to Morocco!\" he exclaimed, he was the French husband of our native Moroccan Air\
  \ Bnb host. Tired and hungry, we followed Guy through the labyrinthine of narrow\
  \ walkways around medina. We arrived to a unsuspecting brown door where Hajiba was\
  \ waiting for us. \"As-salam alaykom!\" she bellowed. She gave us a large inviting\
  \ hug and led us to the dining table where she had laid out several delectable Moroccan\
  \ snacks and drinks. After all my studying of simple Arabic phrases, I went utterly\
  \ blank on how to respond and say \"Thank you\". That evening we learned she did\
  \ not speak English at all, but she was bilingual in French and Arabic. Her husband\
  \ spoke a little English and did all of the translating for her. \n\nThe next morning,\
  \ Hajiba greeted us with a beautiful Moroccan breakfast spread and in French asked\
  \ her husband to ask us in English if we had anything in mind that we would want\
  \ to do. I had read in my book about visiting a hammam and in my broken French and\
  \ almost non-existant Arabic asked her to take us to one. A tremendous smile spread\
  \ across her face. At that moment, in the middle of breakfast, she grabbed my hands\
  \ and lead me straight out the front door into the bustling medina to buy my black\
  \ soap and kess. Although it was only 7:30am, people were already scurrying about\
  \ conducting their business for the day after their first Fajr (the dawn prayer).\n\
  \nWe arrived to a small stand that specialized in selling hammam supplies. Hajiba\
  \ did all of the talking for me, she smiled and spoke to me in a mix of French and\
  \ Arabic with such intensity and animation that even though I couldn't understand\
  \ the words coming from her mouth, I knew what she was saying. She laughed and gestured\
  \ and at that moment, I felt that although we hadn't known each other for long,\
  \ I knew I would always have a friend and a second home in this magical, mystical\
  \ Morocco."
