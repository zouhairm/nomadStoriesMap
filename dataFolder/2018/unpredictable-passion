Text: "I had an Idea about how it would feel like to be in Europe. Visit historical\
  \ buildings, use good public transport, get cold. But none of these impressions\
  \ got close from what really made me feel in \u201Canother world\u201D for the first\
  \ time: the toiled I used just when I arrived had a \u201Ctouch screen\u201D flush.\
  \ Ok, you can laugh. But for me it was such a confront with my reality! I started\
  \ to walk around, and obviously I would be noticed. 5ft tall in a world of giants.\
  \  Brown hair and ten skin around all that barbies and kens. I was in Amsterdam,\
  \ going to an island in Sweden. It was a long way to get there, so I had to sleep\
  \ in Stockholm. When I get there, I was even more surprised. There was no garbage\
  \ on streets, no homeless. Next morning I woke up to fight a battle. I was so excited\
  \ to know how exactly that island was! Then I went without hesitation. It was 7\
  \ great hours of trip. I saw places that I haven\u2019t imagined, animals that I\
  \ have never seen before. When I finally arrived at the hostel, the hostess was\
  \ waiting for me. Even he tried to make me feel at home, it was hard to talk to\
  \ him on the first days. Accent, habits, culture\u2026 everything was different.\
  \ I had my own room and it was hard to believe when I opened the window: the green\
  \ landscape and birds brought an incredible peace to that place. But soon that would\
  \ be also the backdrop of the high season hurry. More guests were coming and  new\
  \ volunteers too, for my happiness. We had a very demanding routine, but it was\
  \ funny. We shared tasks and during the work we met some nice people, and we got\
  \ closer to each other. I also used to run a long way every day in the morning on\
  \ the forests, where I met rabbits, mooses, ate exotic fruits\u2026 and the best:\
  \ I wasn\u2019t afraid! When I realized, I was totally in love with that place,\
  \ the people I met, the things I learned. I was eating less meat, because their\
  \ diet was mostly vegetarian, I started to worry more about recycling, since every\
  \ citizen was responsible for it garbage. I practiced to be kind, as I was serving\
  \ people all the time, and finally, I started to believe people more, because there\
  \ is a strong mentality of honesty and collaboration, things that for me are essential\
  \ to live in community. When I was about to go away, I felt like I wasn\u2019t ready.\
  \ I was going to let a piece of me and take a piece of that place. Who could have\
  \ imagined? A Nordic European country, far from me in so many ways, has left a mark\
  \ on me forever."
