Text: "The call to prayer rings out, in my ears, or maybe just my mind. A day lost\
  \ in the new Middle East, where oppressive monstrosities of steel and glass, and\
  \ the even more oppressive face of a dictator, look down on a city bankrupt of humans.\
  \ Heat rises, the blue sea in the distance tempts the eye, and beyond it, Iran.\
  \ \n\nBleached white, like home in August, with the same dry, bodiless air, but\
  \ it\u2019s 119 degrees. No one is seen, except migrant workers who shuffle into\
  \ buses and disappear on to dual carriageways. Dystopian is what some might say.\
  \ If Lawrence of Arabia met Brave New World. People are not seen in the light of\
  \ day, they are hidden, in subterranean mausoleums of consumer goods, where emirs\
  \ eat KFC and women in abayas shop for lingerie. \n\nI passed out on the bus into\
  \ the city, sleep deprived, listening to songs I cannot remember, and slipping in\
  \ and out of consciousness, my face smashed against the window and my pupils miotic\
  \ from the sun. I awoke in time to see her. \n\nEmma and I were out of place here,\
  \ and as the last people on the bus, one of us decided to sit next to the other.\
  \ We sat together in purgatory, passing between skyscrapers with no sense of direction.\
  \ \n\nShe was on her way back to Copenhagen, and I, New York City. Wandering through\
  \ the souq, we pondered the concept of home, and how essentially, the love of family\
  \ was what we longed for. I talked about how excited I was to arrive at JFK and\
  \ take the A train to my grandmother\u2019s, to arrive in time for breakfast. She\
  \ smiled, and I bought her a necklace to remember me by.\n\nWe hailed a cab, afternoon\
  \ sunlight cascading on the Persian Gulf. Our driver was from Bangladesh, one of\
  \ many immigrants who had come to this country with dreams of boulevards paved in\
  \ gold. Through the rear-view mirror, I watched his chestnut eyes well with sorrow\
  \ when I asked about his family back home. \u201CI have a wife, and 3 children,\
  \ but I have not seen them in 9 years. I cannot afford it\u201D. \n\nThe call to\
  \ prayer rang out over the city.\n\nArriving at International Departures, I handed\
  \ him 250 riyals, the contents of my wallet. \u201CInshallah, you\u2019ll see your\
  \ family a little bit sooner now\u201D. Why did I need that money, when I had a\
  \ wealth of love waiting for me in New York?\n\nEmma and I walked toward the lives\
  \ we were going back to, and embraced, before losing each other in the crowd."
