  \ you\u201D. Can my aunt not hear me? \u201CDabawo?\u201D I call out.  It\u2019\
  s pitch-black here and I feel like I\u2019ve been running for miles. Where am I\
  \ and how did I get here? I can tell only by the thick trees that seem to stretch\
  \ endlessly skywards that I\u2019m in a forest. I\u2019ve been to many forests before\
  \ but not this one. Is my aunt taking me on a road trip again? I do not remember\
  \ her coming to the house though. How did we\u2026\nWait! Where are her legs? I\u2019\
  m confused; a sip of water should get me back to my senses.  \u201CDabawo!\u201D\
  \ I scream again.  \u201CYou want to go home? Go on then,\u201D she snaps. Why is\
  \ she being so strange?\nI turn but see no pathway back. I can see trees in the\
  \ darkness ahead but nothingness behind me. I am beyond frightened but I have to\
  \ keep going. My aunt is my only hope of getting out; she\u2019s family and besides\
  \ she\u2019s probably just as frightened as I am.\nI feel bad for being a brat.\
  \ \u201CSlow down please!\u201D I mutter. I\u2019m dripping of sweat and all these\
  \ years of smoking are finally catching up to me. I feel my chest shut down.\nBefore\
  \ long, we reach what I assume to be our destination and I thank my ancestors, I\u2019\
  m not sure how much more I would have been able to take. I see things clearly now,\
  \ only they\u2019re in black and white; am I just tired? My aunt knocks once on\
  \ the door of this seemingly deserted lone hut and proceeds to open. Without a word,\
  \ she walks right in. Slowly, I peek inside this swampy rondavel. \nGogo? My mind\
  \ is playing tricks on me. I buried my grandmother months ago, we can\u2019t possibly\
  \ be in the same room. She demands a kiss as usual. It must have been a surprise.\
  \ God I love my aunt! I\u2019m not even angry that I\u2019ve been lied to about\
  \ Gogo\u2019s death.  \nI walk to her. I want to kiss her. I never thought I\u2019\
  d see her again! Mom is going to be ecstatic! Shit, MOM! Mom doesn\u2019t know I\u2019\
  m here, but surely she won\u2019t ground me when she hears such good news. \nI am\
  \ not getting any closer to my grandmother. I look down and realise that my feet\
  \ are under water. I can\u2019t get them out. How are Gogo and Dabawo floating?\
  \ I look up, she smiles but her teeth and cheeks don\u2019t look the same. Nothing\
  \ is the same. Has the diabetes gotten that bad? \u201CCome closer child, you won\u2019\
  t sink.\u201D\nSomehow, I know I need to leave. I must be in a parallel universe\
  \ again. I need to wake up, but I can\u2019t move. I can\u2019t scream. Somebody\
  \ needs to wake me up. \u201CMom! Anyone! God please talk to mom, make her hear\
  \ me!\u201D, I pray. \nIt works, I\u2019m home."
