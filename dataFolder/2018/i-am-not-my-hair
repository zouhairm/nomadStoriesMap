Text: "\u201CLook. A Kenyan Mzungu!\u201D\n\nI didn\u2019t have to turn back to know\
  \ that they were talking about me.\n\nI admit that I felt like a walking piece of\
  \ art as I glanced at the reflection of my new hairdo at a local store window in\
  \ Githurai. My head sported a pregnant glow, carrying golden-brown hair strands\
  \ neatly intertwined with coal black weaves imported from Brazil. My own mundane\
  \ brown colored hair ends stood out at various intersections, like rebel soldiers\
  \ on a battle ground.\n\nJust the previous day, I was barely a \u201CMzungu\u201D\
  , a loose Swahili word meaning \u201Cforeigner\u201D, to the conductors lined next\
  \ to their multi-colored matatus(buses). However, that day, five and a half hours\
  \ in a one-roomed salon later, I had graduated into a \u201CKenyan Mzungu\u201D\
  .\n\nHair forms an integral part of one\u2019s identity in Kenya, just like the\
  \ rest of Africa. Whether it is long braids, curly snubs, beaded weaves, glittered\
  \ strands, burnt dreadlocks or scanty hair covered with a matching headgear, Kenyans\
  \ wear it like a crown. This does not mean that hair is all that defines an individual\
  \ as one can also see people of all age and gender sporting a bald head, proudly\
  \ proclaiming \u201CI am not my hair.\u201D This culture ensures a liberating body\
  \ image where everyone\u2019s choice is celebrated.\n\n Growing up in a culture\
  \ where hair is considered sacred, I was taught that losing my hair is akin to losing\
  \ my womanhood. Throughout my life, I have experienced the way people fear a woman\
  \ who dares to take control of her hair. So, I could hear the disappointing screams\
  \ of my mother as I walked into one of the 12 salons lining my street.\n\nIn that\
  \ tiny room, I was introduced to the land where salon culture is not just the forte\
  \ of men. A land where women meet and talk about all things trivial and political\
  \ in the hours they help each other braid out their unrelenting hairs and unsavory\
  \ domestic strifes. And despite the probability of being disowned by my family,\
  \ I decided to cut myself a chunk of what it means to be in this land.\n\nAfter\
  \ a very long time, where five pairs of hands weaved away on my hair, my head felt\
  \ heavier than ever before. However, my spirit felt liberated and I exclaimed \u201C\
  Wow! I look like a Kenyan-Indian\u201D.\n\n\u201CNo!\u201D \n\nOne of the women\
  \ customers of the salon who had helped braid out my hair corrected me. \u201CYou\
  \ look like a Kenyan-Kenyan\u201D, she said.  \n\nJust like that, without having\
  \ to learn the complexities of Swahili grammar or the intricacies of local recipes,\
  \ I felt like I belonged. I was no longer just a \u201CMzungu\u201D."
