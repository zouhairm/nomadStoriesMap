Text: "My 3-year-old self learned to pli\xE9 from the moment I slipped my tiny toes\
  \ into a coveted pair of pink ballet shoes. I\u2019ve spent years in dance studios,\
  \ toes pointed sliding my feet from 1st through 5th position. As I got older I studied\
  \ jazz and now, tap. But I struggled with feeling the same excitement for dance\
  \ as my younger self, until I rediscovered my passion at a small dance studio in\
  \ Edinburgh, Scotland. \nThe dancer\u2019s dress brushed my shoulder as she moved\
  \ forward with arms that were strong but hands that were soft and elegant. Then\
  \ the cante, the Spanish song began and everything that I thought I knew about dance\
  \ floated away with each note. That night I discovered that Flamenco is not just\
  \ a dance about its fast intricate footwork skills.\nAs the dancer moved a woman\
  \ began to sing about a love so strong it penetrated her dreams. A man answered\
  \ her call for love in a melancholy voice. As the dancing continued his singing\
  \ became more intense. The singers drew us into their seduction as they bared their\
  \ souls to us. The entire room was electrified. You didn\u2019t need to speak Spanish\
  \ to understand what was happening.  \nAt times the growling rasp of the guitar\
  \ was the only sound in the room. The way the guitarist plucked the strings you\
  \ couldn\u2019t tell where he ended and the guitar began. He filled the room with\
  \ music from his guitar, his toque, and I felt a part of the dance even though I\
  \ never left my seat.\nThe female dancers wore brightly colored dresses that hugged\
  \ their bodies until just below their hips, then flared out in layers of frills\
  \ and ruffles that could be lifted or flipped. With each movement, the dress took\
  \ on a personality of its own. One dancer twirled around flicking open a large fan,\
  \ she spun it above her head and dragged it across her body. The fan became a whispered\
  \ secret she wanted to share with us and when she was done sharing this secret,\
  \ the fan disappeared as suddenly as it had appeared. \nEvery August thousands of\
  \ people converge on Edinburgh for the world\u2019s biggest art festival, Fringe\
  \ Fest. I had the fortune of being totally consumed by the music and dance fusion\
  \ of a Spanish dance company, Alba Flamenca, during it.\nFlamenco dance is not just\
  \ about the feet, it tells a vibrant story that was authentic, full of emotion and\
  \ inspiring. I had to travel 4,000 miles to rediscover my passion for dance. It\
  \ is an experience that I remember every time I slip my feet into my tap shoes and\
  \ dance, not just the steps but from my heart."
