Text: "The train comes alive, we settle in, absorbing the sights of orange groves,\
  \ stopping at small town stations, picking up and dropping off passengers. After\
  \ a few stops a solo traveller approaches, questioning our seating arrangement;\
  \ it would appear he was given a ticket for my seat. Surely a rare double booking\
  \ error, and the solo traveller sits nearby. Moments later a trio of backpackers\
  \ come up the aisle looking down at their tickets, then back up at us in our seats.\
  \ Nervous concern starts to bubble up amongst our group.\n\u201CDo things like this\
  \ happen often?\u201D I ask the lady next to us. As I fear, she replies \u201CNo.\u201D\
  \n\u201CAre you girls heading to Lagos too?\u201D I question the trio of squatting\
  \ backpackers.\n\u201CNo, we\u2019re going up to Lisbon.\u201D\nThe wave of realization\
  \ washes over us and a jolt of panic kicks in.\nThe lady in the neighbouring seat\
  \ looks at my Portuguese ticket, indicating some of those Portuguese words meant\
  \ \u2018transfer\u2019 at Tunes to \u2018continue\u2019 to Lagos. The seats are\
  \ no longer ours, we were meant to get off at the last stop.\n\u201CYou must get\
  \ off!\u201D  the lady yells, setting us into motion. We grab our packs and jump\
  \ onto the platform before the train lurches onward. We look around to see tumbleweed\
  \ roll through the deserted station before spotting the elderly Portuguese couple\
  \ shuffling along the other side of the tracks.\n\u201CEnglish?!\u201D we call out,\
  \ displaying universal cues of \u2018help!\u2019. They speak slightly more English\
  \ than we do Portuguese, which is simply obrigado (thank you).  The pair study our\
  \ ticket, seeing that we are headed to Lagos and must quickly get back to the last\
  \ station, in Tunes, to catch our train.\nThey walk us into the quiet town and the\
  \ lady deciphers that I am the \u201Cdaughter\u201D of this group, and she\u2019\
  s the \u201Cwife\u201D and the gentlemen with her is her \u201Chusband\u201D.  The\
  \ man leads us to the town\u2019s only taxi, which is missing its driver, so he\
  \ dials the driver up on his old style flip phone. He is at the caf\xE9, and will\
  \ be right out to help us. The wife explains our travel mishap to a patiently waiting\
  \ lady, who offers her position in the taxi line, a generous contribution to our\
  \ fight against time. Sharing hugs, smiles and a lot of \u201Cobrigados\u201D we\
  \ are off on a wild taxi ride, making it to the station just in time.\nWhat a perfect\
  \ disaster! The pieces so precisely lining up to get us back on track. We often\
  \ recall that story, fondly remembering the kind old couple that came to our rescue,\
  \ and regretting the missed opportunity to get their names and snap a photo."
