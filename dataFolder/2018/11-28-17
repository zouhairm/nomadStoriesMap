Text: "11.47 \u2013 That\u2019s it, our last day on this farm. Finally, we are heading\
  \ to San Venanzo.It is nice from Rosaria that she is driving us there.Process of\
  \ waking up went very well, coffee and breakfast in Italy never disappoints.Morning\
  \ sex and last one this farm was as good as usually. \n12.53 \u2013 We went to grocery\
  \ for some snacks, then walked approximately 20 minutes to the gas station situated\
  \ next to the nearest driveway.Direction Firenze.Bus is leaving at 10pm so we have\
  \ 9 hours to travel 230km. Sounds easy, doesn\u2019t it?\n13.17 \u2013 I just looked\
  \ at my girlfriend and realized how beautiful she is.I want to have it written here.It\
  \ makes me proud. \n13.42 \u2013 Yay, my first hitchhike!Just after no more than\
  \ 30 minutes a man, in his early 30\u2019s, took us to Perugia.It is not Firenze\
  \ but we are 50km closer.We told him our story how we were volunteering on an olive\
  \ farm, how we were shepherding sheep, picking olives and stuff and how we are trying\
  \ to hitchhike all the way to Firenze to catch our bus back home.Luckily, he was\
  \ nice enough to drive us to the nearest driveway point there, although he was going\
  \ to the other side of the town.Everything is perfect so far, except the dark chocolate\
  \ made in Poland that we bought.Yeah, the cheapest one.Never good combination. \n\
  15.19 \u2013 An hour and half of trying.Occasional smiles from drivers are nice\
  \ but people we need to go!\n15.33 \u2013 Am I dreaming right now or are we in the\
  \ 5 seats car with 4 other people and the dog?Crazy.Driver is an Italian woman,\
  \ who is supposed to be language teacher to the other guys.They are Germans.Two\
  \ girls and one boy.During telling our story again, with classic responds \u201C\
  that\u2019s great\u201D and \u201Cwow\u201D the German guy lights up a joint.As\
  \ he is passing joint to driver nobody appears to be surprised.She is hitting some\
  \ puffs. \n15.38 \u2013 She finished whole joint by her-self.I do not feel safe.\
  \ \n15.57 \u2013 Driver starts to talk more.I think it is the weed effect.Funny\
  \ how is she able to make all those hand gestures while driving.She is telling us\
  \ that they are going to the place NEAR Firenze.So, we would need to hitchhike once\
  \ again.Still better than nothing. \n16.09 \u2013 Okay, place NEAR Firenze is more\
  \ place near Perugia.They just left us about 40-50km from Perugia at some driveway\
  \ exit.Don\u2019t know if they were so stoned, or it was just language barrier or\
  \ combination of both but this is definitely not even NEAR Firenze!\n17.11 \u2013\
  \ Seems like nobody stopes here.It is getting colder and darker.Common guys, the\
  \ time is running!"
