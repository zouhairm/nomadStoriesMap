Text: "\u201CWait, whaaat...those are my friends! They\u2019re the ones I climbed\
  \ the mountain with!\u201D That\u2019s what I said to Casey, who was sitting right\
  \ next to me on the bench. I had met him earlier in the week while camping. From\
  \ across the empty town plaza, I noticed that they had their gear with them; ice\
  \ axes and brightly colored alpine boots were secured on their framepacks. But we\
  \ had already stood on the summit of Mexico\u2019s highest mountain just a day ago\
  \ \u2026 which meant only one thing \u2026 they were ditching me. \n\nI sat there.\
  \ Stunned. Maddie knew all the Spanish and Nathan and Amy, who had previous experience\
  \ and the Lonely Planet guidebook, controlled the logistics. And shucks! They had\
  \ the aloe! I was practically pulling my face off from the bad sunburn the glacier\
  \ gave me. \n\nCasey\u2019s question snapped me back to reality. \u201CAre they\
  \ heading to the bus station?\u201D They definitely were, and there was no way I\
  \ was going to catch up. Just 20 minutes ago, I had strolled down to the plaza on\
  \ a quest for breakfast and left my gear in the the hotel room since we had agreed\
  \ on the later 11:20 bus. \n\n\u201CHold on just a sec, dude. I\u2019ll be right\
  \ back.\u201D\n\nI jogged over to them, and tried to sound casual as I asked them\
  \ what was going on. They glanced at each other and Nathan spoke up, \u201CWellll,\
  \ we really wanted to go to this beach area on the western coast, but it takes a\
  \ few days just to get there. It\u2019s on the other side of the country. Doesn\u2019\
  t your flight leave in a few days?\u201D\n\n\u201CIt leaves in five days, yeah.\
  \ So you guys are leaving for there...now?\u201D My voice trailed off. He said something\
  \ about an early start. I probably said, \u201CIt\u2019s cool\u2026\u201D and something\
  \ pathetically people pleasing. What else was I supposed to do?\n \nI halfheartedly\
  \ wished them good safety and headed back across the plaza. As I strolled toward\
  \ Casey, I looked up at the massive mountain, its icy glaciers glistening like glass.\
  \ Nathan hadn\u2019t made it to the top. Altitude sickness had kept him at the base\
  \ camp. I was the one who had led Maddie and Amy through the hardest part. I suddenly\
  \ realized if I could do that, I could handle anything. \n\n\u201CIs everything\
  \ cool?\u201D Casey wanted to know.\n\n\u201CYeah, it is. They wanted to go to another\
  \ area that didn\u2019t work out for my schedule.\u201D\n\n\u201COh yeah?\u201D\
  \ Casey\u2019s voice perked up. \u201CI\u2019m going to attempt the second highest\
  \ summit and I could really use a partner. Got any plans?\u201D"
