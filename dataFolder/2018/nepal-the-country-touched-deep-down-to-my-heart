Text: "I love travelling.. Especially i love discovering the cultures. For me travelling\
  \ is discovering a culture is through the way they live.\nWith this reason, when\
  \ I got married, type of honeymoon we had was kind of backpacking which let me discover\
  \ the culture more deeply. After spending three months in South America, I ended\
  \ up in Nepal.\n\nNepal is full of culture from Buddhism and Hinduism. But what\
  \ is making them that much special for me is their warm hearted people. \nI preferred\
  \ to take public transport wherever we go to experience more of it, even though,\
  \ there is a transport called \"Tourist Bus\" which makes quite easier. It was taking\
  \ sometimes double time of those tourist buses because it was stopping in every\
  \ corner to drop off or pick up and sometimes just standing up in the middle with\
  \ full of people for hours. But it was the time we were mostly making local connection\
  \ and talking with everyone. Because they were also quite eager to know about us\
  \ and about culture. One of them even invited us to their home for dinner. They\
  \ love talking, they love sharing and they were happy we were one of those travelling\
  \ like they do. It is the best way to get hints about country. \nIt was hard but\
  \ it was also so much fun! \n\n\n\nAnd just another time on the way to Hindu temple,\
  \ I have met a little girl around 9 years at the exit of the temple. She was so\
  \ eager to talk but also quite shy. We started to talk with the parents. They were\
  \ coming here for pilgrimage from a far city like other Hindus and asking us whether\
  \ we would go to visit them. And this little girl was about her dreams. While leaving,\
  \ she gave me her cute copper ring as a gift which was fitting to my little finger.\
  \ I am still keeping it and i will. I believe the energy it has on it coming from\
  \ an innocent heart.\n\nThe last story I want to mention about Nepal is the Annapurna\
  \ Circuit trek in Himalayas. It took us 12 days to reach Thorung La Pass, at 5416\
  \ meters. Everyday walking for hours and staying in one of the village house at\
  \ night. There are villagers that open their house and give you a room in addition\
  \ to the lodges in the village.  And those rooms were the ones we have chosen to\
  \ stay. In these houses, they have maybe one extra room. So, you settle down in\
  \ the room, they prepare dinner for you like you are their guest and enjoy the food\
  \ together. And it was an the nicest way of hearing their stories and seeing  how\
  \ they live their life rather than watching far from."
