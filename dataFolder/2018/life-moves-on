Text: "Got an email which read \"London official visit 2 weeks\".\nMy first outside\
  \ my homeland\"India\".Was it the best time to leave? Heartbroken over a 7 year\
  \ relationship,and an almost finalized marriage,now all over.I was wondering was\
  \ this a sign from the universe for me to take life easy and embrace the change?\n\
  I decided not to think n jotted down the details of the official visit,made the\
  \ arrangements and told myself I would come home a changed person and learn from\
  \ the travel, determined to leave my past behind,I took my first flight or rather\
  \ the first step towards moving on from a 7years love life which ment my world.\n\
  I landed in London excited, nervous Missing him, wishing we would be back thought\
  \ processing what would it be like if we were still together.I shove the thoughts\
  \ back make my taxi reservation and move to my hotel,had a long flight,got some\
  \ food and was getting ready for an early meeting.\nPhone rings,it is 3am in India.I\
  \ wonder who is calling,the name reads \"Love\",my heart skips a beat,is it him?He\
  \ is Missing me ,he wants me back,after 6months,he finally calls. Excited I pick\
  \ the phone glad to hear his hi baby voice,I melt,I miss him,I love him, only after\
  \ a brief conversation I come to know he is getting engaged a day prior to my birthday,and\
  \ he wanted to say sorry that  we did not work out.\nUniverse crashes on me, London\
  \ is suddenly more lonely and cold,I cry on the phone,wish him all the happiness,hang\
  \ up.\nLook outside the window,a voice inside me says dadaa I miss you,daddy's girl\
  \ wants to hug daddy, wiping my tears I go to bed,I have an early meeting and life\
  \ has new challanges.\n Early morning in office,I get to work meet new people, discuss\
  \ new business,back of my mind\"he is getting engaged\".No not now I tell myself,look\
  \ at the London skies,not clear it resembles my life now.I suddenly smile I have\
  \ company,the universe has a conspiracy,it did not want me back home,it took me\
  \ miles away,so I could be alone and get through this difficult time.\nI walked\
  \ back to the hotel, carrying some take away,and a bottle of wine to celebrate my\
  \ freedom from a 7year prison of fake love.\nIt started to rain,I could cry while\
  \ I walk, nature was by my side,the darkest times I could be myself, understand\
  \ I don't need a man to complete me.Ate my food had my wine,made a call back home,smiled\
  \ that I am happy in London and safe and daddy looking at me said ,\"ur my brave\
  \ little girl\".\nI wanted to hug him,but his brave girl said,\"I will call u Tomorrow,life\
  \ goes on"
