Text: "It was one of those cold European winter days of November when I first arrived\
  \ in Germany from India as a student. My first trip abroad, nervous and anxious\
  \ as to how I would go about this foreign endeavour, i was well prepared with all\
  \ my documents, Insurance, travel card, cash and warm clothes to encounter any sort\
  \ of hassle during my travel. \nWaiting at the local train station (Hauptbahnhof)\
  \ in Dresden, for the next leg of my journey, i came across a family of 4 waiting\
  \ on a bench beside mine. Different in attire and complexion, presuming i might\
  \ just have encountered someone from the subcontinent, i made a move to have a little\
  \ chat. \nTo my surprise, the family turned out to be one of the migrant families\
  \ fleeing war in Syria. A young boy of age 16,Wasim, along with his 2 young sisters\
  \ and father. I was too afraid to ask about their mother. One of the little girls,\
  \ age 5, cheerfully enjoyed her time at the train station becoming a centre of attraction\
  \ for everyone around, completely unaware of the tragedy unfolding in the Middle\
  \ East, courtesy of ISIS. The little girls laughter echoed all over the train station.\
  \ As I moved deeper into conversation with Wasim, it turned out the family had crossed\
  \ over from Idlib in Syria to enter Turkey and then crossed the Mediterranean on\
  \ a small boat to reach the European shoreline. Young Wasim, to my surprise spoke\
  \ better German than me! He couldn\u2019t understand English much, but we somehow\
  \ managed to convey each other our thoughts. They all had a rucksack each, which\
  \ primarily contained food supplies and essentials. \nOverwhelmed with emotions,\
  \ what the young children at such a tender age had to go through made me wonder.\
  \ On the contrary, there I was, sitting with 2 big luggage bags with all creature\
  \ comforts. Their ordeal inspired me to the core and my heart was filled with admiration.\
  \ I managed to sneak in a quick picture of the family as a memory, just to remind\
  \ myself how petty my own problems are! Wasim, my new Syrian friend asked me \u201C\
  Can we be friends on Facebook\u201D? With a smile on my face, I obliged and we became\
  \ friends in virtual and real life too! A connection \u2013 an unusual one! \nThe\
  \ family then embarked on the next phase of their journey as they boarded a train\
  \ to their next destination further north, uncertain as to what awaits them in the\
  \ future. I wished Wasim and his family a safe journey and a good fortune ahead.\
  \ What amazed me the most were their smiling faces -'The Spirit of Living'. Life\
  \ finds a way."
