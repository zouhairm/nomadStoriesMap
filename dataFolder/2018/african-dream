Text: "\"Here we are, lady!\", my guide said, turning off the car, \"You can have\
  \ lunch in this resort and relax in the swimming pool for about two hours before\
  \ we leave again for Tsavo East Park. Meanwhile, I\u2019ll take the opportunity\
  \ to visit my family.\" \nHe smiled at me, but I didn't move out from the car. I\
  \ was hungry because I had left the lodge in the Tsavo West Park after a quick breakfast,\
  \ in order to reach our destination before sunset. I glanced at the restaurant,\
  \ tasting the grilled chicken cooked in coconut milk. Then I smiled back at him\
  \ and he understood I was hungrier for something else. \nHe started the car again.\
  \ Just one busy dirt road crossed the town: our jeep was going slowly past people,\
  \ carts and few other cars. He parked in a narrow road outside a low grey building\
  \ and he guided me to a place that took us off our schedule for the first time.\
  \ Beyond the entrance there was a garden and around it his extended family house.\
  \ Immediately, about ten little boys ran to him shouting with joy. I found out that\
  \ they were his own children and nephews. From the courtyard, some women stopped\
  \ sewing colorful pieces of fabric and looked at me.\nMy guide explained to me that\
  \ the building was composed of four houses, one for each relative and his wife and\
  \ children. His own home had two rooms, one was the bedroom for all his family and\
  \ the other was the kitchen and the living room. \n\"We are a rich African family\"\
  \ he emphasized. \"We have a house and food every day\". \n\"You are richer than\
  \ everyone I know,\" I replied. \nI had only had a mango juice that day for lunch,\
  \ but I felt satisfied all the same. The time ran very fast, talking with his gentle\
  \ wife in the common language of gestures and expressions and playing with the children.\
  \ The little girl was the cutest: she insisted on sitting next to me and she couldn\u2019\
  t stop touching my hair. With her sweet embarrassed smile, she was busy comparing\
  \ her frizzy hair to mine. \n\u201CWe have to leave now, lady.\u201D An alarm went\
  \ off in my head. I felt blessed because, for a brief time, I had had the chance\
  \ to experience that authentic kind of happiness in which I would have always been\
  \ a stranger, a guest in someone else\u2019s place. \nThat day I learned that traveling\
  \ means changing your course, finding something unexpected, and writing about it.\
  \ Writing about travel is a kind of translation: not from one language to another,\
  \ but from an emotion to words, in a way that people can feel this emotion and learn\
  \ how traveling enhances our lives."
