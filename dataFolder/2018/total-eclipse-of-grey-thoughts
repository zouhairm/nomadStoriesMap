Text: "\u201CFuck!\u201D, another time. The computer screen reflects me the millionth\
  \ email of rejection, finding work for me has become a utopia in the last few months.\n\
  This time, however, is different. I was given time and set limits. Both are overcome.\
  \ I take the only inevitable decision that I have set aside so far: leaving. I have\
  \ 3,000 Euros left in my account and the great desire to visit Canada. I have no\
  \ other excuses, who knows if I can clear my mind or meet someone who changes my\
  \ perspectives.\nI book the cheapest air tickets and an equally convenient room\
  \ on Airbnb, which attracts me with its strangely Buddhist decor, so unexpected\
  \ in relation to the context and also to my host, Ewa, who is of Polish descendents.\n\
  I\u2019m not sure what to expect from our meeting, but I\u2019m so disappointed\
  \ by the last events that I do not really have time to think or worry about it.\n\
  When I arrive in Vancouver the impact is not the best, Ewa lives alone in a spacious\
  \ and bright apartment in the suburbs, well connected to the city centre, but she\
  \ is quite annoying. She immediately lists her rules about the house and the keys:\
  \ I am not particularly well inclined to listen after a nine-hour flight.\nSince\
  \ we have to live together for a week, I think it\u2019s better to avoid her as\
  \ much as possible, especially in shared spaces. I know it is rude and mean and\
  \ totally contrary to the spirit of Airbnb, but I can\u2019t help it. Even Ewa does\
  \ not make much effort to be friendly: we only cross each other for breakfast before\
  \ I leave in the direction of the Pacific or Downtown glass skyscrapers.\nHowever,\
  \ the morning before leaving a strange fact happens: Ewa calls me to go out on her\
  \ veranda and she shows me the Sun. There is a total eclipse in progress, the one\
  \ the newspapers have been talking for days. It is not as majestic as in the US,\
  \ but it\u2019s such a strange apparition. Ewa shows me that great gray Sun and\
  \ I can\u2019t avoid smiling: I\u2019m 10,000 km far from home, I am witnessing\
  \ a phenomenon that is not visible in Europe and I\u2019m finally making a new friend.\
  \ Ewa and I begin to talk about everything, truly, now: her education in Poland,\
  \ her travels, her family scattered all around, her son getting married, there in\
  \ Vancouver; me and my country, the lack of opportunities. We discover that we are\
  \ less crabby than we thought, that we share common roots, that we love art and\
  \ literature and much more. And to think that everything started out from the dim\
  \ light of a completely paradoxical August Sun."
