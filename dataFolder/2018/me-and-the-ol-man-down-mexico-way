Text: "When I was 17 years old, I got to experience both.  Me and the ol\u2019 man\
  \ were heading to Lake Guerrero located in northeastern Mexico.  I was at that time\
  \ going through some, shall we say changes.  My hair was down to my shoulders, I\
  \ dressed like a slob and, being summer, I had several splotches of stray hair dotting\
  \ my face.  I played in a band and wrote poetry.  I thought I knew everything and\
  \ was quick to ignore any adult advice.  Luckily, I still loved bass fishing and\
  \ was overjoyed at the thought of spending a week south of the border.  \n\nAfter\
  \ a semi-comfortable flight, we met a few of our fellow anglers and driver, Arturo.\
  \  We all hopped into a brand new Chevy Suburban and crossed the gates into another\
  \ country.  The first difference I noticed was the driving.  Arturo never applied\
  \ the brake, he just honked his horn.  And along with the other Mexican drivers,\
  \ this style converged into some sort of manageable chaos.  I was terrified, but\
  \ the steely look of Arturo and the calmness of my father, let a coolness prevail\
  \ that stayed with me on the three-hour journey down dirt roads at speeds upwards\
  \ of 100 mph.  But we managed to arrive unscathed and, denying an urge to kiss the\
  \ ground, I took in my surroundings.  It is an amazing country.  \n\nWe caught many\
  \ fish, but it was the rest of the experience that still stands out.  \n\nDad and\
  \ I had drifted apart a little bit due to that stage in my life and bass fishing\
  \ helped hold it all together.  We experienced things on that trip for the first\
  \ time together.  Dad was as silly as ever, making the entire caravan stop on the\
  \ way to the lake so he could get out and photograph the biggest cactus he had ever\
  \ seen.  \u201CMi padre es muy tonto,\u201D I would tell Arturo, as I was fresh\
  \ off my second semester of high school Spanish.  And he would laugh; nobody really\
  \ angry for the interruption.  \n\nMe and the ol\u2019 man shared the sights of\
  \ skeletal cows picking at sun burnt grass protruding through cracks in the rocky\
  \ ground.  We walked upwards of a mile to see a church and school that had stood\
  \ proudly since Spanish settlers erected the buildings in the 1600\u2019s.  Dad\
  \ let me sip a margarita due to fact that I was above the legal age down there,\
  \ meaning I could see over the bar, and it was on that entire trip that a father\
  \ and his 17 year old son reconnected.  \n\nI felt closer to my father than I had\
  \ in years.  To this day, it is as a vivid a memory as ever and I will always remember\
  \ the adventure down south Dad and I shared."
