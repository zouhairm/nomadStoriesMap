Text: "If travelling to Jaipur, Rajasthan was just a treat for the eyes it wouldn't\
  \ be a lifetime realisation. A place/travelling is not just a video to be filled\
  \ in your colour seeking eyes, but I realised it could redeem your thought process\
  \ by the exposure to its content. A journey by someone who thought world is so small\
  \ and travelling just satiates the eyes.\nMe and my friend Rohit have been planning\
  \ a North Indian journey for quiet a long time. A perfect gap of time was something\
  \ we missed. Surprisingly amidst my exams and viva, we got a gap of over 15 days\
  \ to explore Rajasthan and Delhi. We planned from Thrissur( town in our native state,Kerala)\
  \ to Agra. From Agra to Jaipur , then to jodhpur, Ajmer, Pushkar, finally to Delhi.\
  \ It's a tradition of most of the trains in India to be late. Journey begins. I\
  \ could really feel the adrenaline plus dopamine rush all over for many reasons.\
  \ The first time I'm going on all my own for this much long distance. An equal contradictory\
  \ awe of responsibility and freedom kicked in. I can remember every minute of that\
  \ train journey. Some funky boys were next to our cabin and I passed a usual . The\
  \ moment we started talking to them, I felt the recessive me. We almost took a 3\
  \ months to initiate a 15 day long journey. But these guys just packed a pair of\
  \ clothes and are travelling to Kashmir,3500 km away from their place as like a\
  \ usual weekend thing. While I almost pooped in my pants to smoke a cigarette in\
  \ the train, these guys were rolling joints. I bet they didn't know the local language,\
  \ but they know how to manage things more than us.\nWe got down at Agra. Agra, 'taj\
  \ mahal' is the first word that comes in our mind. One of the seven wonders of the\
  \ world. But we emphasised more on Navaratri day on Jaipur, 5 hours from Agra. Sadly\
  \ enough we missed it. Leftovers of navaratri was seen throughout the streets of\
  \ Jaipur. We got cozy stay with cheap price and a day. ldly person. Akash, an English\
  \ citizen with Indian origin, has seen more India than us. \nWe decided to roam\
  \ the city together next day.\nJaipur,the pink city was not really pink, its more\
  \ of a saffron. Markets, City, Forts, streets, food, too bad I can only write 2.5k\
  \ letters in this. Rather I would not try writing as it could not match up to what\
  \ I felt.\nThat very night we left to Jodhpur. Literally the blue city. My eyes\
  \ has never ever craved for this much beauty. We spent there up to 11 pm. Ajmer\
  \ and Pushkar were the next. Niravana, without a trace of drug."
