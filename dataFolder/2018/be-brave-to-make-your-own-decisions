Text: "For me, to travel means being home, being free, and finally being at ease.\
  \ \nI have been to the most amazing and astonishing places. Islands with beaches\
  \ one more beautiful than the other, countries with cities each more diverse and\
  \ fidgety than the one before. Listened to the most touching stories and laughed\
  \ about the funniest jokes all around the world.\nI stranded in Barcelona since\
  \ my everything got stolen, and was abused and spat upon by Cambodian while wearing\
  \ the wrong hat. I am constantly searching for the next exotic getaway.\n\nSo I\
  \ decided to visit Pakistan, a city torn by civil war and sieged by the bad. With\
  \ my mother worried sick and my friends confused I chose to plan my journey to Karachi,\
  \ Islamabad and the rural regions. I want to be honest with you. I was scared, had\
  \ sleepless nights and thought about the worst. I combed through online forums and\
  \ asked my digital friends in travel chats from all around the world. I was faced\
  \ with shocked know-it-alls and horror stories. When I finally told them, that I\
  \ just turned 21 and are a, as some call it \u201Cfragile\u201D female, their were\
  \ outrageous. \n\nNevertheless, me and my adventurous nature full of excitement\
  \ and childish curiosity started our journey to one of the most dangerous country\
  \ in the world. I stepped out of my comfortable and save plane, onto the land of\
  \ the unknown. My heart started to beat faster. Where am I going? What do I have\
  \ to expect? What will happen down there? When I finally arrived, the least I expected\
  \ happened! \n\nI never in my life met such a happy, friendly and heartwarming folk.\
  \ Everyone greeted me as I would be their long lost child and had been a part of\
  \ their life forever. I got smiling faces and happy laughter from every side. I\
  \ even started to feel uncomfortable. Born in Munich, the City of sauerkraut eating\
  \ beer drinking Oktoberfest maniacs, I sure know how to party, but barely know how\
  \ to be overly friendly and super open to strange people. I started to realise that\
  \ all my anxiety and my fear was reasonless. The bad preconception of that amazing\
  \ country was ungrounded. And my vacation in Pakistan was one of the most amazing\
  \ and most relaxed ones.\n\nI am happy that I dared the journey into the unknown.\
  \ I can only recommend everyone to not always simply accept everything what you\
  \ might hear from people who mostly have no clue about anything. Be smart and be\
  \ brave to make your own decisions and built your own assumptions about the world\
  \ and the people out there."
