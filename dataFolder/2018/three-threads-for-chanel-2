Text: "The rollicking tremors of the wheels underfoot sealed the train car with white\
  \ noise. I sat in a silent cabinet sailing through the night. The screen of my throwaway\
  \ phone read 8 PM. I was heading south, from the beaches of Viareggio to Firenze.\
  \  \n\nI sat there with the knowledge that I came within a hair\u2019s breadth of\
  \ missing my flight home to the United States. I could not be moved to regret my\
  \ impromptu trip to the coast. I thought to myself that sometimes you can find amazing\
  \ things when you get lost. I had spent the day warming my bones on a private beach.\
  \ \n\nIn the diaspora of the fashion district in Firenze, Italy, there stands a\
  \ fabric shop called Casa De Tessuti. One afternoon, two friends and I were wandering\
  \ the streets around the Duomo, the last scraps of our walking lunch in hand. We\
  \ popped into Casa De Tessuti, attracted by the jade green window dressings. This\
  \ establishment housed a museum, with quite the fine collection of rare silks, wools,\
  \ and cashmere. We could not have known that one of the owners would takes a shine\
  \ to us and spend an hour telling us the story of fashion in Italy.\n\nRomano showed\
  \ us an iridescent fabric that was blue on one side and pink on the other. He showed\
  \ us a thread of three colors (pink, pale yellow, and pearl) that had comprised\
  \ one of Chanel\u2019s earliest tweed suits. He asked us questions and joked with\
  \ us, meticulously combing through all of the fabrics and selecting one for each\
  \ of us to encapsulate our essence as people.\n\nThis experience is my most treasured\
  \ memory from the month that I lived in Italy, among the mornings spent sketching\
  \ sculptures and the afternoons spent painting various Italian street scenes. \n\
  \nThere are so many questions I would have liked to have asked Romano, had I had\
  \ a better grasp on the language.  These were mysteries that I would contemplate\
  \ for many years after my visit at Casa de Tessuti. \n\nI was swept up in the charm\
  \ of the store and its owners. Romano seemingly inducted me, personally, into the\
  \ history of Florence. I felt proud that the fabric he had picked for me was woven\
  \ with thin cords of real gold. Maybe one day I will be back to pick a fabric for\
  \ my wedding dress, as Romano imagined.\n\nI have since searched for reviews of\
  \ Casa De Tessuti, each new story warming my heart. As one writer said, they left\
  \ the store understanding Da Vinci\u2019s words: \u201CWe should find someone worthy\
  \ to inhabit these wonderful materials!\u201D"
