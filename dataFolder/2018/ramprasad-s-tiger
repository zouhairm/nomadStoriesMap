Text: "It was 7 p.m. when we reached the camps. Our night safari was scheduled in\
  \ 15 minutes. I wasted no time, covered myself in layers of clothes, gulped down\
  \ some rum and hopped into the gypsy. It was pitch dark, barring the gypsy's headlights.\
  \ We stopped in front of a gate; a guide came and sat next to our driver Ramprasad\
  \ with a torch in hand. We entered the forest wrapped in blankets. The guide told\
  \ us that a male tiger was spotted a few minutes ago and we shall try to look for\
  \ it. The air became colder and heavier as we went deeper into the forest. Our gypsy\
  \ jolted to a halt and Ramprasad switched off the headlights. He turned around and\
  \ whispered, \"We'd stop once in a while to listen to the calls\". My clueless expression\
  \ made him elaborate; \"Other animals make alert calls when a tiger is nearby\"\
  . A chill ran down my spine.\n\nOur gypsy trotted on the bumpy path, every time\
  \ it crumbled the dry Sal leaves with its tires, I thought it was an animal's footsteps.\
  \ We could hear a call. It grew louder. Ramprasad told us it was a barking deer\
  \ that had spotted the tiger! He pointed the torch to the ground, there were fresh\
  \ pug-marks. He whispered, \"It\u2019s a male tiger's\u201D. A weird sound interrupted\
  \ his monologue; it was his phone's ringtone. Someone called to inform that a female\
  \ tiger was in that area too and we must keep our eyes and ears open. I wanted to\
  \ pee. I tried to divert my mind from nature's calls to alert calls.\nWe heard the\
  \ monkeys scream. Our gypsy took a sharp turn, we drove in the direction of the\
  \ cacophony. We reached a bridge that had a little stream flowing under it. We noticed\
  \ splashes of water on the sand. The guide said that the tiger was there minutes\
  \ ago. By now, my back had become sore. I kept telling myself that real adventures\
  \ lie beyond one's comfort zone.  But my bed seemed to call out to me.\n\nI looked\
  \ at my phone to check if there was any network. No luck. Only Ramprasad's phone\
  \ seemed to work even in the forest. Our safari time was almost over. The torch\
  \ came out one last time, Ramprasad aimed it all around; the tiger was nowhere to\
  \ be seen. With our eyes still scanning the forest, we made our journey back to\
  \ the camps. As we drove past the the Sal trees, I glanced on both sides through\
  \ the corner of my eyes. A pair of shiny eyes seemed to stare at me from behind\
  \ the bushes. I turned my head back, I couldn't see a shape or form, just those\
  \ eyes. Was it just a fragment of my imagination or the tiger played a round of\
  \ hide and seek with us?"
