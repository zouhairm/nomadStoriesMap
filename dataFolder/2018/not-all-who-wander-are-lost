Text: "I planned to go grocery shopping after an appointment on the Upper West Side\
  \ this afternoon. A regular, normal night. No adventure, no chance meetings, just\
  \ ordinary shopping. I realized I was close to the river, so decided to check it\
  \ out instead. Food can wait, at least a bit. I head to the pier; walking out above\
  \ the water watching the sun, the clouds. I begin to snap photos, naturally. As\
  \ I go to slip my phone into my pocket, a honey bee lands on the corner. My initial\
  \ reaction: fear. I want to shake the phone furiously, get it off and away. After\
  \ all, it could sting me and what was it doing here anyway? I stopped, paused, looked\
  \ at the bee. Shifted, diluted, transmuted. Love. I wondered, where did you come\
  \ from? Where are you trying to go? Why did you come to me? My heart began to swell,\
  \ \"Bring him back to the flowers\". \n\nI walked slowly, carefully. I notice, he's\
  \ cleaning himself. A good sign, he feels safe. I make my way off the pier and towards\
  \ the trees. I ask myself where I'm going. I don't know but I follow the green.\
  \ There will be flowers somewhere, I'm sure. Stepping purposefully. \"Bring the\
  \ bee home\".\n\nI see the trees, a willow, some others I cannot identify. No, that's\
  \ not it. He needs flowers. I keep walking. Somewhere, somewhere. The riverside\
  \ cafe. Yes! Brightly colored flowers, I choose a tall, full yellow one. I bring\
  \ my phone towards the plants and he flies away. I give thanks and continue. \n\n\
  I wander back to the street, the cars, the buildings. Time to focus. But wait, I\
  \ look up, World Yoga Center. I read the signs, check the schedule, get some information.\
  \ I give thanks that yoga finds me. I continue, a few steps, I look up again, Floating\
  \ Mountain: Tea House & Gallery. This sounds nice. \n\nI see plants, white walls,\
  \ a tea kettle, and a modern wooden bookshelf. Zen. I feel it. Let me see. I walk\
  \ towards the door. Ashtanga Yoga Upper West Side. I laugh to myself. I walk up\
  \ to the second floor. I say hello, we smile. Wood, bamboo, floor pillows, clean,\
  \ clear energy. \"This is a tea house.\" I don't know what this means but I remove\
  \ my shoes, leave my bag, look around and choose a seat. This feels right. The corner\
  \ by the window with a view of the street. A tall, slender woman comes over, kneels\
  \ beside me on the cushion. I ask, she explains. Over 90 teas, hand-picked from\
  \ China. What experience would I like? I choose red. She guides, prepares, I drink.\
  \ We talk. We share. A new friend. Confirmation, inspiration. My first tea ceremony."
