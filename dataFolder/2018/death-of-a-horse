Text: "A white horse died when I was trekking along the Kashmir Great Lakes trail\
  \ into the Himalayas. At the rugged  terrain of Gadsar pass at an altitude of 4350\
  \ m, even humans find it difficult to put steps together. These quadruped animals\
  \ with about 5 times the weight of each human carrying on their shoulders have to\
  \ cross narrow passes on mountain top so that human can enjoy their amateur treks\
  \ and put the photographs of their heroic journeys in social media. \n\nA white\
  \ horse died when I was descending down from the the Great Lakes. In that rough\
  \ boulder paved terrain, I slipped down couple of times. Many of my group members\
  \ slipped more than that. The horse slipped once. For the last time.\n\nThe white\
  \ horse was injured on the top of Gadsar pass. He could not balance the gravity\
  \ with unaccustomed overloading on his back. So, he walked the final few days with\
  \ a twisted ankle, till the journey came to an end.\n\nI was a mere spectator when\
  \ the horse fell down for the last time. Some of us tried to push him so that he\
  \ can walk for another few kilometres to the village. Horseman tried pulling with\
  \ another horse. But this white horse wanted to rest. Forever.\n\nThis white horse\
  \ was the saviour for at least 3 humans in our group. When humans could not walk,\
  \ he carried them on their back. So, when the horse was down we decided to keep\
  \ the animal into the wilderness. \n\nIt is not the story of one white horse, but\
  \ several thousands of horses are being killed by humans, indirectly, for pleasure.\
  \ Promotion of mountain trekking and adventure sports have come up with a new mode\
  \ of business all over the world. Silent murder is going on the backdrop of this\
  \ business. It\u2019s not only horse, the wild animals and birds are being tortured\
  \ by unnecessary invasion of unwanted species like human into the wild. \n\nSo,\
  \ I decided to travel alone. I decided to travel silent. After this incident. \n\
  \nI became more close to the wilds."
