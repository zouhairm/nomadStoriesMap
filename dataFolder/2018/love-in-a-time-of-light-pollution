Text: "We admired the orange glow coming from the horizon as we perched on the roof\
  \ of an expat bar called \u201CThe Backyard.\u201D I wasn\u2019t sure if I\u2019\
  d had too many drinks or if the night was hazy with light pollution and young lust.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWhite Rabbit,\u201D he said, finally breaking the silence, \u201CThat\u2019\
  s your new Chinese name.\u201D\n\nSeven months earlier, I had applied for a university\
  \ teaching position in Weifang, China on a whim. I wanted to experience life in\
  \ a different country. I also needed distance from a toxic six-year relationship.\
  \ The \u201CCity of Kites\u201D \u2013 325 miles south of Beijing, with a population\
  \ of 9 million people \u2013 seemed like a perfect place to escape. With a single\
  \ karaoke session I was quickly swept into a ragtag expat community where we would\
  \ drink Tsingtao beer like water, Sunday morning communion was McDonald\u2019s breakfast,\
  \ and our chariots were hailed taxis speeding through cold nights in a concrete\
  \ jungle.\n\nI quickly had a favourite class, made up of boys my father would only\
  \ describe as \u201Cshit disturbers.\u201D They called me laoshi (teacher), although\
  \ my curriculum wasn\u2019t much more than watching American music videos. Once\
  \ they asked how old I was. \u201CLaoshi, you could be our sister.\u201D It was\
  \ true. I was only a year or two older than them. \n\nOne boy in particular stood\
  \ out. He was tall and his body language was smooth and confident. His brown eyes\
  \ were behind glasses but they couldn\u2019t hide how he looked at me with a playful\
  \ cocky smile. \n\nAs spring emerged and the barren magnolia trees began to birth\
  \ white flowers, so too would my crush flourish. Arduous was the task of remaining\
  \ professional while the tension continued to grow between us. Finally, on the last\
  \ day of class he asked if I would like to go for dinner before I went back to Canada.\
  \ \u201CShi\u201D, I replied with a nervous smile.\n\nThat night, amongst a bustling\
  \ sidewalk and stomach butterflies, we were engulfed in the aroma of five-spice\
  \ and smoke from the flamed grill. We spoke in broken English and Mandarin and snacked\
  \ on bamboo skewers full of heavily seasoned enoki mushrooms, tofu, and pork.\n\
  \ \n\u201CLet\u2019s go to The Backyard,\u201D I proposed. Within a minute we were\
  \ doubling on his bicycle through wet narrow cobblestone streets to alight on the\
  \ roof of a bar before saying goodbye forever. And in that warm summer breeze, gliding\
  \ through the dark glistening streets I would finally let go of my relationship\
  \ back home. I just didn't expect to leave a piece of my beating white rabbit heart\
  \ behind."
