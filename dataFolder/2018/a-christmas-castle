Text: "In the midst of a charming English town called Shrewsbury, with old stone cottages\
  \ and winding streets, there\u2019s a small castle. After being convinced by an\
  \ eccentric neighbor, my family booked our bed and breakfast for Christmas in the\
  \ little town. It was the coldest December England had braved since 1981.\nUpon\
  \ arrival, we learnt that all of the shops were closed during our short stay. It\
  \ wasn\u2019t much of a bother after playing trivia games with our host and sharing\
  \ pints at the neighboring pub, but my younger brother and I had been looking forward\
  \ to visiting the castle.\nOn Christmas Eve, after the influence of several pints,\
  \ my brother told me that he had spotted an entrance into the castle grounds during\
  \ an afternoon walk. The warm coat of English beer helped convince me that seeing\
  \ the castle would be a lovely Christmas adventure for the two of us. \nIt was late,\
  \ and the glow of orange light from the windows of the pub had been extinguished.\
  \ My brother and I ran through the snowy streets, grinning ear to ear, whispering\
  \ Harry Potter spells and giggling. \nWhen we finally got to the castle, I asked\
  \ my brother where the entrance was, and he motioned towards the massive wrought\
  \ iron castle gate. \n\u201CWe can\u2019t climb over that!\u201D I said as he monkeyed\
  \ his way over the bars that protruded outward at the top. Somehow, in my inebriated\
  \ state, I managed to climb them too, and we clambered into the snowy grounds. \n\
  Everything spooked us\u2014the wind, snow pluffing off of tree branches\u2014and\
  \ then sirens. \nFiguring that we must\u2019ve triggered an alarm, and dreading\
  \ having to call our parents from English jail, I started to work tears to my eyes\
  \ to claim drunken confusion when the police arrived. My brother ran up a hill and\
  \ looked over a castle wall into a snowbank. \n\u201CI\u2019m going to jump,\u201D\
  \ he declared. I peered over the edge into the bluish glow of snow far below.\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m going to turn myself in,\u201D I said.\nI returned to where we had climbed\
  \ the gate, and although it was much harder with a bit more sobriety, I managed\
  \ to get back\u2014only to discover that the sirens had stopped up the street. Relieved,\
  \ I called over the fence to my brother. Silence.\nI was now too sober to climb,\
  \ and I began to fret about my brother\u2019s jump. Ten minutes later, he toppled\
  \ over a garden hedge up the street. We scampered back to our warm bed and breakfast,\
  \ excited to exchange gifts while wearing our duvets in several hours\u2019 time.\n\
  In 1138, King Stephen successfully besieged Shrewsbury Castle. In 2011, I did too."
