Text: "I walked out completely and utterly dejected. Even if I hadn\u2019t walked\
  \ in feeling at the tipping point of burn out I don\u2019t think it would have mattered.\
  \ Work had become a never-ending nightmare. I was living in a constant state of\
  \ stress. I went into this job thinking I would make a difference, that it would\
  \ be fulfilling and inspiring. And it was at first. I was passionate and worked\
  \ hard because that's all I know how to do. It's all I've ever done. However, having\
  \ everything that makes you special torn apart in one sitting is devastating. I\
  \ was at the end. I had nothing left to give. They had single-handedly made me hate\
  \ all of the parts that made me amazing, two days before I left. I went to Scotland\
  \ with the expectation that I was going to find great change and the moment I stepped\
  \ off the plane in Glasgow I took a deep breath and felt a sense of complete satisfaction.\
  \ I crossed the threshold from the plane and took in the stone buildings, the castles\
  \ and the ever-expanding greenness, and I was hit with a sense of freedom that was\
  \ tantalizing. Walking out into the streets I could almost taste it. They were busy,\
  \ exciting and full of energy. Maybe I was producing the energy in my head but I\
  \ had become full of life. A kind of life I didn\u2019t have at home; I couldn\u2019\
  t find at home. I was inspired. Life was rich here. Walking through the turrets\
  \ of Edinburgh Castle on the first day I found my moment. The single moment which\
  \ changed it all. Suddenly as I looked out of the castle into the stands of the\
  \ Edinburgh Tattoo I knew. I knew it didn\u2019t have to be this way. All those\
  \ things that made me special still meant something; just not to them. That was\
  \ the moment I decided I was going to do things differently. I was going to live\
  \ my life my way. I would do things I loved simply because I loved to do them because\
  \ that\u2019s how I lived when I travelled. I liked the person I was when I travelled\
  \ so I wanted to always be that person. No one would be in control of how I felt\
  \ about myself, except me. As I stood there looking out at this magnificent city,\
  \ breathing in the air that had suddenly become so refreshing, I realized I could.\
  \ I went to Scotland after one of the worst times looking for a life-changing experience.\
  \ I wanted an \u201Ca-ha\u201D moment, to clear my head and show me there was more\
  \ for me. The colours of Scotland opened my mind to possibilities I couldn\u2019\
  t find sitting behind a desk or in a small room. Life is full of excitement when\
  \ you finally decide to live it."
