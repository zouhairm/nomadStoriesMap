Text: "While visiting Muscat, Oman, I spent my last night in town at the Mutrah Souq\
  \ (\"souq\" basically = market in an Arab city). I had rented a car for the duration\
  \ of my stay and was trying my best to find a parking spot, though even on a Sunday\
  \ evening the streets were packed. After circling my destination for 20 minutes,\
  \ I decided to investigate a small strip of space with a painted curb. I pulled\
  \ in, got out and began my research - walking up and down the length of the painted\
  \ area, rereading the signs half a dozen times. It was still unclear. Frankly I\
  \ don't remember if the signs had any English on them so let's assume my \"rereading\"\
  \ was more \"staring blankly at some Arabic words\". A car pulled in right behind\
  \ me and the occupants exited with a confident air that just screamed \"we believe\
  \ this is a legal parking spot.\" I approached the driver to confirm my suspicions,\
  \ said hello in Arabic and then made gestures to the sign and curb indicating my\
  \ confusion. Luckily the driver spoke a bit of English and was friendly. He and\
  \ his friend were intending to grab a bite not too far from where we were standing\
  \ so he suggested we exchange numbers and assured me he would call if the cops showed\
  \ up because he was NOT sure we could park there. \n\nLeaving the souq about an\
  \ hour and a half later, I get a call. My friendly stranger was calling to invite\
  \ me to dinner as he and his friend were leaving their first stop; I said yes. We\
  \ met up at our parked cars, I got some stuff out of my rental, locked it up and\
  \ hopped in the backseat with these two strangers I had just met. They were Iranian\
  \ and on vacation too and just about the sweetest guys you could imagine. The backseat\
  \ had bags of sweets and pistachios from their native country which they generously\
  \ shared. Later that evening when we finally parted ways, they refused to let me\
  \ go without accepting a stash of their foreign candies.\n\nThere were many adventures\
  \ over the course of that night; it was a whirlwind of unexpected locations, people\
  \ and situations. We drove all over Muscat, Arabic club music blasting, meeting\
  \ up with some of their family members and eating Polynesian food in a hotel while\
  \ listening to a salsa band. Only one of them spoke any English so we communicated\
  \ mainly through Google translate - Farsi to English and vice versa. The point is,\
  \ I took candy from strangers and it was the best trip I ever had."
