Text: "When I was nineteen, my mother and I went on a guided tour of the highlights\
  \ of South Africa. It was our first trip south of the Equator so it was a big deal\
  \ for seasoned travelers like us. On the third day of our trip, our itinerary included\
  \ a visit to Table Mountain and the afternoon at a winery. The winery was fun but\
  \ the guide didn't tell us about the little cheetah sanctuary. There was a small\
  \ cheetah sanctuary at this winery. You could actually walk into the sanctuary and\
  \ pet the cheetah. I've never seen a wild cat up close and personal before. Two\
  \ people from the group decided to go to the sanctuary. I was hesitant to go because\
  \ I've always heard about when wild animals attacked people and it wasn't pretty.\
  \ My mom pushed me and urged me to go in. I did. I was wearing a bright yellow sweatshirt\
  \ and the zookeepers told me to take off the sweatshirt because cheetahs are sensitive\
  \ to bight colors. Fortunately, I had on a dark blue polo T-shirt underneath my\
  \ sweatshirt, dark blue jeans and sneakers. \n\nI went into the area where the cheetah\
  \ would come. One of the zoo keepers was with me and the other two people from the\
  \ tour group. Another zoo keeper was walking the cheetah on a leash towards us.\
  \ I was nervous as hell and it showed. My heart was pounding as the cheetah approached\
  \ me. The zoo keeper and the cheetah stopped at our feet. Just as we were about\
  \ to pet the cheetah, the cheetah let out a loud growl. I jumped and backed away\
  \ immediately. The other zoo keeper calmed me down and told me the cheetah was just\
  \ nervous about being around strangers. The zoo keeper then walked me back to the\
  \ cheetah who was sitting down with the other zoo keeper and was calm down too.\
  \ I and the others got turns petting the cheetah. It was such a surreal experience.\
  \ Cheetahs are beautiful animals and are so calm and quiet they wouldn't hurt a\
  \ thing (OK, maybe when they hunt for food.) Petting a cheetah was like petting\
  \ a big cat that came to life and it did not shed. You could REALLY feel in breathe\
  \ and its heartbeat and not be scared. This is a wild animal that can run up to\
  \ 70 mph yet it was calm and happy. I had a few photo ops with the cheetah and the\
  \ zoo keeper and then we had to get back to the tour bus. Our tour guide was mad\
  \ at us for petting the cheetahs but the experience was worth it. Being up close\
  \ and personal with the world's fastest land animal is an experience that put my\
  \ fears to the test and I made a connection with mother nature."
