Text: "When I agreed to take a month to teach Yoga in Nicaragua I did not actually\
  \ have any immediate thoughts or preconceived notions about the Central American\
  \ country. I had booked a gig teaching in the city of Granada for four weeks and\
  \ whenever I spoke with anyone familiar with Nicaragua they were quick to mention\
  \ the picturesque colonial charm of Granada. I gathered it was a popular tourist\
  \ stopover; well situated, not far from surf towns, Isletas (a community of about\
  \ 350 small islands on the lake), several volcanos and a volcanic island, not to\
  \ mention a growing number of foreigners and expats bringing a modern vibe to the\
  \ city. As I levelled with the city and got into a flow, immersing myself within\
  \ the Nica community, I began to observe the real volume of art and talent rooted\
  \ in tradition that this country had to offer. Perhaps I was too quick to assimilate\
  \ my initial thoughts about the country, thinking  of it's persona more along the\
  \ lines of Costa Rica, a country which values nature but has a completely different\
  \ character than the one I met in Nicaragua. \nNicas are observers of nature, they\
  \ have an infatuation with fauna and flora, it's colours and forms replicated on\
  \ innumerable canvases. Nicas are uncompromising and assertive about self expression\
  \ and individual rights which comes across passionately in the verses recited by\
  \ revolutionaries such as Ernesto Cardenal and Gioconda Belli, found in vast amount\
  \ of eclectic book shops and spoken word festivals. The arts are a profound part\
  \ of the Nica history and heritage and they teach their youth to appreciate and\
  \ celebrate this amazing healing practice. Painters, printmakers, woodworkers, photographers,\
  \ break dancers, acrobats, poets, street musicians, fire dancers or any other craftsperson\
  \ with ingenuity of the imagination, you are sure to at least find yourself immersed\
  \ in one of the many artistic masteries the Nica people have to offer. A lovely\
  \ New Yorker Yogi I met during this trip described Granada in particular as the\
  \ New York City of Central America! A perfect description of the explosive amount\
  \ of artistic flow I experienced here. This trip more than any other showed me the\
  \ value of immersing yourself locally, to delve deep into communities to be able\
  \ to make a greater connection than the already magical connection to the place\
  \ on Earth. To truly see people who reside in this habitat and cultivate a collective\
  \ consciousness which they are willing to share, is something really extraordinary."
