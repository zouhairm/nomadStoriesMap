Text: "\"You goin' in?\"\n\nHer frizzy red hair was a hopeful indicator of someone\
  \ I may be able to communicate with, considering I only knew two words in Japanese.\
  \ It's not that I wouldn't have enjoyed petting domestic owls alone, but relief\
  \ filled my veins upon hearing, \"Yeah I think so, wanna join?\"\n\nBased on that\
  \ handful of words, I didn't notice an accent. Then again, I've never been stellar\
  \ at pegging accents. The familiarity I felt with this woman as far as a shared\
  \ language only magnified upon learning she grew up just a few hours from my hometown--\
  \ thus, the lack of accent.\n\nI could tell solely on first impressions that this\
  \ woman had depth. Her warm, inviting energy extended beyond strangers like me.\
  \ Listening to her talk about her husband (who manages companies across Asia, being\
  \ the driving force of their many residencies in the past decade) and sons (both\
  \ in different levels of higher education) exuded a profound sense of pride and\
  \ joy. She was inexplicably in love with her family.\n\nI was sure she was going\
  \ to make a comment about setting me up with one of her sons, but the apprehension\
  \ I felt remained as just that-- a feeling. I\u2019ve always been the type to ask\
  \ questions so when the conversation turned to me I had the choice of exposing myself.\
  \ I channeled the part of myself that was empowered by Brene Brown\u2019s TED talk\
  \ on vulnerability and forming connections.\n\n\u201CI actually won a trip to Tokyo\
  \ as part of a contest for LGBTQ people\u2026\u201D\n\nWhat followed was just as\
  \ unexpected. \u201CMy son is gay! He\u2019s actually in med school at NYU studying\
  \ gastroenterology because he wants to create a safe environment for gay men who\
  \ need health care. I didn\u2019t elaborate on that earlier because I wasn\u2019\
  t sure where you stood with that.\u201D\n\nAfter being open about my personal life,\
  \ she revealed some of the complicated moments of her own experience in self-acceptance\
  \ and personal growth. The stories she told about ridding herself of toxic family\
  \ members deepend my appreciation for her engaging nature and bravery.\n\nWe continued\
  \ to share personal stories, ideas about society, and create memories for hours\
  \ that day. Fast forward six months, we keep in touch and continue to push each\
  \ other closer to our goals. I\u2019m now at home saving money for more solo traveling\
  \ and eventually moving to NYC-- where I now have a connection to a future LGBTQ\
  \ friend. Those moments of living unfiltered and authentically have been the foundation\
  \ to a connection afar as well as an unintentional connection at home."
