Text: "The sun had set by the time I arrived at the small, gated door of the boarding\
  \ house, trailing behind the sizeable wake of Jorge Massa, the director of the football\
  \ club where I would train for the next two months. \nIn the common room, shirtless\
  \ players lounged on broken sofas, throwing tattered cards on a coffee table. As\
  \ I nodded nervously towards these boys, the kitchen doors burst open and out came\
  \ a white-haired, wild-eyed man clad in nothing but a sombrero and long-johns, singing\
  \ joyfully, \u201CLa cucaracha, la cucaracha, ya no puede caminar! Cha, cha, cha!\u201D\
  \ \nThis was Jorge, the manic cook of the house, who\u2019d mistaken me for a Mexican\
  \ player arriving the next day. The boys laughed while Jorge rattled of a string\
  \ of apologies, pulling me close to his bare, bloated stomach, to the sting of Fernett\
  \ leaking from his pores. \nOver the weeks that followed, I would learn of Jorge\u2019\
  s childhood in La Pampa, of the odd jobs he\u2019d stitched together after dropping\
  \ out of school, of the failures that had led him to become a drunken chef who fed\
  \ 40 boys still clinging to the futile dream of becoming a futbolista.\nOn my last\
  \ night, I sat with Jorge and the boys on the concrete stoop passing a gourd of\
  \ mat\xE9 around, telling stories. One by one, the boys shuffled off, until suddenly,\
  \ I realized it was just the two of us. \n\u201CDid I ever tell you about La Guerra\
  \ de las Malvinas?\u201D\nI paused, picking up a trace of sadness. I shook my head.\
  \ \n\u201CIt was a violence beyond belief,\u201D he muttered softly, \u201CWe did\
  \ some things that, that I\u2019ll never forget, some terrible, terrible, things.\u201D\
  \ \n We sat in silence pulling on the metal straw of the mat\xE9, watching old men\
  \ slip into the strip club across the street.\n\u201CHold on,\u201D he said suddenly,\
  \ striding inside. When he came back, he was brandishing a weathered red-and-blue\
  \ jersey, smiling. \n\u201CWhen I worked for San Juan, this is the jersey they gave\
  \ me to say thank you.\u201D\nHe handed me the jersey, and I nodded, \u201CIt\u2019\
  s beautiful.\u201D I tried handing it back to him, but he shook his head.\n\u201C\
  This is my way of saying thanks.\u201D He smiled, patting my back. \u201CYou\u2019\
  re a good guy Yankee, I mean, a different type of good guy. I\u2019m going to miss\
  \ this.\u201D\n\u201CWait,\u201D I stopped him, running inside. Rifling through\
  \ my bulging backpack, I tore out my wrinkled clothes and dog-eared books, until\
  \ I found it\u2014my college training jersey.\n\u201CPara ti, Jorge,\u201D I murmured,\
  \ handing him the black and white jersey. He smiled and nodded. Seeming content\
  \ that all of this had been a fair exchange."
