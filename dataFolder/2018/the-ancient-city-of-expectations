Text: "We arrived at the Sun Gate, soaking wet at only 7am, after three arduous and\
  \ intermittently rainy days of hiking.  At this landmark, the entrance to the ancient\
  \ Inca city, you would see it on a clear day.   We saw only white.  The famous green,\
  \ sharp peaks were invisible.  This weather had been teasing us since day two, and\
  \ we could stop guessing what it would do at our destination.\n\nThe anticipated\
  \ Inca Trail.  Machu Picchu, set in the Andes Mountains of Peru, was on my wish\
  \ list for years.  At a younger age I never thought I could handle the trail, but\
  \ I grew stronger and more in love with hiking.  It\u2019s not a perfect relationship;\
  \ I have been on countless hikes where I was apathetic.  More memorably, I have\
  \ had many ecstatic moments while hiking.  It was natural I would gravitate toward\
  \ the Inca Trail.  I wanted to feel that elated again.  I was ready.\n\nThe trek\
  \ was increasingly challenging each day.  The second afternoon came the rain, clouds,\
  \ and cold.  It was a likely occurrence in October.  Even more difficult for me\
  \ to overcome was the altitude.  My heart raced if I pushed myself, and it was not\
  \ an option to go at my normal pace.  It took every ounce of my energy to get through\
  \ those four days.  By day two I was dreaming about relaxing with endless coffee\
  \ in the Museo del Caf\xE9 in Cusco.  \n\nTo say I was disappointed in my time on\
  \ the Inca Trail, a time I had built up in my mind for years, does not explain how\
  \ it feels. Having such a lack of joy among the rocky cliffsides, gigantic peaks,\
  \ and brilliantly engineered archaeological sites unique to world history, is an\
  \ emotion I can\u2019t come up with a word for.   \n\nDespite these struggles, the\
  \ beauty and significance was not lost on me.  The first day the sky was deep blue\
  \ and we saw three wild horses that were oblivious to our presence.  On day two\
  \ the rocky trail was carved into the side of a mountain with a lush valley below\
  \ and more mountains across. Porters on visible sections ahead of me looked like\
  \ yellow dots in their uniforms.  At one point I looked back behind me, through\
  \ the open, steep valley, at a distant peak with snow  I was in disbelief to be\
  \ standing there alone with this awe-inspiring view on a remote Peruvian mountainside.\
  \  \n\nI conquered a strenuous, world-renowned 26 mile trek, a feat that seemed\
  \ only a pipe dream ten years ago.  I would never take back my experience.  Even\
  \ when they don\u2019t fulfill your dreams, each one is an accomplishment."
