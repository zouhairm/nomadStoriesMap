Text: "I was halfway up an exposed rock face, climbing an iron ladder continuing 1,000\
  \ meters towards Passo Gardena. My oversized hydration pack, carrying my clothing\
  \ for 10 days, hung awkwardly to one side. My original plan was to run the Alta\
  \ Via 2, a challenging long-distance hiking route in the Italian Dolomites, while\
  \ staying in mountain huts along the way. Due to heavy spring snowfall, I found\
  \ myself improvising, which led me to climbing one of the most famous via ferrata\
  \ routes in the Dolomites with no safety harness or protection. These via ferratas,\
  \ Italian for \u201Ciron path,\u201D were first established during the First World\
  \ War to assist Austrian and Italian troops in difficult high altitude environments.\
  \ These permanent lines, found throughout the Dolomites, allow people to ascend\
  \ and descent steep and spectacular faces by a mixture of hiking and scrambling.\
  \ A light hail started as I climbed my way into the folds of the Sella mountain\
  \ range. At the top, I met two Italians in crampons celebrating with a sandwich\
  \ on the deck of the mountain hut Rifugio Pisciadu, recommended in the guidebook\
  \ as having good refreshments. The windows were boarded up and ice blocks floated\
  \ in a nearby pond. They helped me make a call to another rifugio and the musical\
  \ Italian voice of the manager gave me directions, welcoming and excited. \n\nI\
  \ covered another 15 miles that day and icy trail was replaced with soft green grass\
  \ and deep mud. I passed a malga, or dairy farm, which rang of cowbells as the rifugio\
  \ came into view, sitting at 1700 meters at the edge of a cliff underneath the foot\
  \ of the silver peaks of the Agn\xE8r-Croda Granda Group. The aesthetic setting\
  \ of Rifugio Scarpa originated as painter Enrico Scarpa\u2019s dream to build an\
  \ artist\u2019s retreat in the mountains, but was now managed by a family of welcoming\
  \ mountaineers. Inside, a warm fire and plate of cheesy polenta was placed on a\
  \ red and white checkered tablecloth. Hikers finished their pasta, wine, and espresso.\
  \ A rainshower ended in time for sunset, and light turned the mountains silver and\
  \ rose. The Dolomites, also known as the Pale Mountains, are formed from a high\
  \ concentration the mineral dolomite, composed of pink, white, and gray crystals\
  \ illuminated by changing light. We sipped wine and grappa by the focolare, Italian\
  \ for \u201Cfamily fireside.\u201D Another unknown adventure awaited me on the trails\
  \ the next day. My initiation to these mountains, like the signature crystal of\
  \ the Dolomites, was an elemental experience."
