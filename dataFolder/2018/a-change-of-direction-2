Text: "I saw a group of about five young men, all wearing bright red, on their front\
  \ porch barbecuing. I was walking on the far side of the street when they first\
  \ caught my eye so it was a pretty difficult and obvious change of direction to\
  \ face the young men and walk towards them. One of the guys who noticed my change\
  \ in direction shot up from his seat, \u201CYou know where you at!\u201D He barked.\n\
  \u201CDetroit\u201D I replied hesitantly. I could feel my head widen with the extra\
  \ blood.\n\u201CBut do you know where you at though!\u201D he shouted back.\n\u201C\
  The...East-side? ...Right?\u201D\n\u201CWhere you AT though?\u201D he repeated as\
  \ I got closer. He was doing the fat boy flick of the bottom of his shirt as he\
  \ made his chest bigger and bigger.\n\u201CI don\u2019t know.\u201D I finally said.\n\
  \u201CThis Beckwick Bluuds bruh! You might just get laid down round here! Talkin\u2019\
  \ body bags.\u201D he ended with a raised corner of his lip.\nThe guy at the grill\
  \ stopped and cut off his friend\u2019s intimidation speech, \u201CYo! Let the boy\
  \ talk man, damn!\u201D He then turned to me quickly with a smile and asked, \u201C\
  Wanna turkey burger?\u201D\n\"I'm good,\" I said out loud but not because I didn\u2019\
  t want the turkey burger, but because I didn\u2019t want to walk through their front\
  \ gate and instead leaned against the outside of the white picket fence and asked\
  \ them the same questions that I\u2019ve been asking everybody here.\nThey said\
  \ the usual, \"Detroit's hit the bottom already. it's doin' good now.\" \"Ya it's\
  \ a violent town, but the violence is because everybody is broke so people look\
  \ for fast cash from bad people.\"\nThen I was asked for the first time all day,\
  \ \"Where you from?\"\n\u201CCalifornia.\u201D I said\n\u201CWhat part?\u201D \n\
  Nobody, not even people from California, knows where the great town of Ripon is,\
  \ so I answered with the well-known area an hour away from Ripon, \u201CThe Bay\
  \ Area.\u201D \n\u201COh shit! That\u2019s why this lil boy rollin\u2019 around\
  \ ain\u2019t even shiverin\u2019.\u201D \nThen someone sang, \u201CBay Areaaa!\u201D\
  \ like E-40. I didn\u2019t expect the Bay Area to carry so much street cred. I honestly\
  \ assumed that nobody even listened to E-40 outside of the Bay Area.\nWhen we all\
  \ got to talking they were really nice. Even the guy who stood up and shouted at\
  \ me softened up. They seemed to genuinely care about me when I told them what I\
  \ was trying to do. They wanted, and encouraged me to do good and told me earnestly\
  \ to do my best to change the world, \u201CIt\u2019s each of our own responsibilities\
  \ to make this world better.\u201D the grill master said.\nI did end up taking that\
  \ turkey burger."
