Text: "There are many tales about Southeast Asia, and arriving in Jakarta I didn`t\
  \ know what to expect. The air outside was humid and soaked with that heavy smell\
  \ of many people and traffic that reminded me of India. It was blatantly shocking\
  \ that the skyscrapers and the misery here were next to each other. The apartment\
  \ that I was staying in was too luxurious bearing in mind I was in a country where\
  \ poverty was beyond what is understood in the Western world. It was an interesting\
  \ combination of Asian, European and Arabic culture, full of contradictions with\
  \ cheap products for everyone, except for the locals. Yes, Indonesia is the biggest\
  \ Muslim country in the world but together with the Islamic sound of \u201Cazan\u201D\
  , there were the realities of life. The Asian girls were desperate to find a \u201C\
  white master\u201D who enjoyed their kingdom of pretty women. They girls did not\
  \ expect much and were in need of protection but there was no place for hope in\
  \ this city. White men got their \u201Chappy ending\u201D but they were rarely seen\
  \ on a flight to Europe holding the hand of their Asian sweetheart. The idea of\
  \ a doomed life reminded me of a letter I once received from a prisoner in Bangwang\
  \ in Bangkok. That place was home to many miserable souls who crossed Asia every\
  \ year driven by need, desperation and stupidity and went straight into the arms\
  \ of a hard bed and malnutrition. It was a topic that I wanted to pursue as a journalism\
  \ student and I still have that letter today. His name was Juhentan Woon Hong or\
  \ Micky. He was half Thai, half English, a baby of an Asian mother and a \u201C\
  white master\u201D. He had been sentenced to 33 years in prison for drug smuggling.\
  \ \u201CI was adopted when I was just a few months old,\u201D he wrote. \u201CI\
  \ worked since I was a child \u2013 as a cleaner, a waiter, a bartender, a restaurant\
  \ manager. I know that my mother was called Julia Lee and left me because my father\
  \ had left her. His name was Steve and he ended up in this very same place after\
  \ that, convicted for smuggling heroin, marijuana, ecstasy and methamphetamines.\
  \ He also got 33 years and died 15 years ago due to stomach problems. Most times\
  \ here we don`t even get to the food that only comes once a day. Some prisoners\
  \ even eat cockroaches. My life stopped at the age of 24 when I came to this place\
  \ where  \u201Cluck\u201D is a dirty word.\u201D A land of contradictions, you would\
  \ think. I know, that was the first word that always comes to my mind when thinking\
  \ of Southeast Asia. \u201CEden\u201D for some people and \u201CEast of Eden\u201D\
  \ for the rest."
