Text: "The first soul I met when I finally boarded the Sunkist orange Stray New Zealand\
  \ bus was a person I\u2019d soon come to recognize as my missing half. Julian, a\
  \ London-based teacher and fellow wanderluster, welcomed my disheveled self to the\
  \ seat next to his, and there it all began. \n\nJulian and I stepped off the bus\
  \ together at our first stop, Punakaiki, New Zealand, home of the Pancake Rocks.\
  \ I knew we were meant to be when he was visibly disappointed at the site. Though\
  \ the rocks were like none we\u2019d seen before - thin layer after thin layer of\
  \ rugged limestone stacked on top of one another - the allusion to pancakes had\
  \ gotten his travel-weary hopes up. A man after my own heart.\n\nAn hour later,\
  \ we walked along a beach covered entirely in gray pebbles. Signs warned us against\
  \ swimming in the temperamental wake, and though the waves were indeed crashing\
  \ angrily against the shore, we refused to not go in. Moments later we were scrambling\
  \ to rescue his sandal from the tide, but we ultimately lost the battle. Not to\
  \ worry, he assured me, the shoe was like graffiti on the wall; it was proof that\
  \ he was there. \n\nWe traipsed through a rainforest on the way to the Franz Josef\
  \ Glacier, a stripe of sky blue ice in the middle of the Southern Alps. We remarked\
  \ on the temperature - the wild swing from near tropical conditions around our heads\
  \ and shoulders with Arctic conditions beneath our crampon boots. We hiked four\
  \ hours together on that glacier, up and down the frozen waves, stopping occasionally\
  \ to take a picture with our ice axes and climbing gear. \n\nTogether we traveled\
  \ the perimeter of New Zealand, searching for adventure wherever we went. We found\
  \ it in chili-spiked hot chocolate under a setting Queenstown sky. We found it on\
  \ a morning walk along an endless coastline, finger painted sky dripping pinks and\
  \ yellows around us. We found it in camp-style lodges, games of spoons in secondhand\
  \ costumes, mirror lakes, hours of stories while the countryside swept by beyond\
  \ the window, oxtail hearts, and handstands in parks. \n\nMostly, we found it in\
  \ each other. \n\nYears later, we talk on occasion, usually sticking to the gentle\
  \ pleasantries of people who knew each other once. But we can pick it back up with\
  \ just a memory: one of a windswept dream vacation that started a little rocky."
