Text: "My second day on beautiful Sao Miguel gets off to a foggy start\_\u2026 but\
  \ of course that doesn\u2019t stop me from exploring!\n\nSaturdays, as in many islands,\
  \ are the busiest market days, so off we are\u200A - that is my wonderful host Jos\xE9\
  -Maria and me\u200A - \u200Afor some #MARKETing in Ponta Delgada, the island\u2019\
  s capital. \n\nI love markets and indulging in the cultural experience. To my surprise,\
  \ everything is HUGE here\u2026except for Jos\xE9-Maria and me\u2026 Well, and the\
  \ pineapples for that matter\_:)\n\nWe stroll across the market and as I learn about\
  \ typical produce, Jos\xE9-Maria enjoys sharing funny stories about his fellow islanders.\
  \ Walking and talking in the heat gives us an appetite so we stop for some food\
  \ right by the harbor and I\u2019m happy to find at least a vegan salad - not a\
  \ given here, as I learned rather quickly upon my arrival. \n\nAll fed and content,\
  \ we continue our island tour along the South shore, meet locals, enjoy the sea\
  \ and each other\u2019s company\u2026 \nAfter hours of exploring the rich wildlife,\
  \ a cooling dip in the Atlantic waves and numerous espresso stops along the way,\
  \ we make our way back home. Back home. Two words I\u2019m saying so naturally although\
  \ I just arrived here two days ago. But as I keep saying, home is where my heart\
  \ is and right now it is right here! \n \n\xABAt home\xBB\u200A - \u200Aunder the\
  \ watchful eyes of a curious cat - Jos\xE9-Maria turns out to be not just a wonderful\
  \ host and island guide but also a very skilled (part-time vegan) cook! Under the\
  \ watchful eyes of now 2 curious cats, he cooks up a storm and serves a delicious\
  \ vegetable curry made with the local goodies we bought at the market earlier\u2026\
  \n\nNurtured, tired and content we are actually tempted to go to bed right away\u2026\
  \ but don\u2019t and head to a festival in a town nearby instead. Parking in itself\
  \ turns out to be quite an adventure, as the entire islands seems to have gathered\
  \ here for the event. As we finally reach the fully neon-lit church in the center,\
  \ Jos\xE9-Maria finds out that the famous Brazilian band he came for has been replaced\
  \ by the local \xABsinger\xBB Pedro, who gives his all. Unfortunately, he just can\u2019\
  t sing. But nobody cares because after all it\u2019s not a flawless performance\
  \ but a fun night with food, drinks and wonderful people that makes for lasting\
  \ memories!\n\n---\nThis is an edited \"text only version\" of an original picture\
