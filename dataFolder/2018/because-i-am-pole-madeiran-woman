Text: "When exploring \u201Emulti-facial paradise\u201D, which for me is Madeira \u2013\
  \ Portuguese island somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean, I did not expect that I would\
  \ have had an unique opportunity to meet personally one Polish duchess. Moreover\
  \ \u2013 she is from Subcarpathian region of my country, where also I grew up. Let\u2019\
  s meet Jolanta Lubomirska, who calls herself as a Pole-Madeiran Woman.\nHow did\
  \ it happen that two inhabitants of the South-East Poland met each other 4000 km\
  \ from home?\nOn the one day of my 10-months European Voluntary Service, I decided\
  \ to look for Polish people living permanently in the island, to get to know their\
  \ stories and what brought them here. It was not for sure labor migration, like\
  \ it is in case of moving to Great Britain. Here, in the island, you just live pleasantly\
  \ \u2013 this is what all people said that I had meetings with.\nI found out that\
  \ about 30 Polish people have chosen Madeira as their place on Earth. I managed\
  \ to meet with five of them. What are they doing here? Sonia and Renata arrived\
  \ here to start a life with their \u201Cother halfs\u201D. Juliusz, because you\
  \ have to decide someday where to live permanently. Piotr was at the beginning member\
  \ of the table tennis team, then a trainer, and finally he became a guide.\nAnd\
  \ duchess Jolanta Lubomirska came here in 1960s, because her parents bought a block\
  \ here and she has to take control over it. If she didn\u2019t do it, a block would\
  \ become a government\u2019s property. At present a house, which she built there\
  \ with her French husband, could be rented by tourists. It is Vila Calaca, located\
  \ in Funchal, close to the ocean, in Lido area.\nI have met with her in the theatre\
  \ caf\xE9. She came with her daughter \u2013 Hanna Karolina. \u2013 She understands\
  \ Polish, but she speaks English and Portuguese. Because I wanted to learn Portuguese\
  \ as soon as possible. I feel a little regret that I didn\u2019t push further for\
  \ the our native language learning. But it\u2019s still not so late, so maybe they\
  \ managed to learn it anyway \u2013 she explains to me.\nWhat I found surprising\
  \ \u2013 she studied gardening at Warsaw University of Life Sciences, but she has\
  \ never worked in Madeira as gardener \u2013 even the whole island is sometimes\
  \ called \u201CThe Garden of Atlantic\u201D.\nShe worked many years as a tourist\
  \ guide. \u2013 I started this job in 1980s. I was a kind of \u201Cpirate-guide\u201D\
  , because I didn\u2019t have then special certificates to do this. But finally this\
  \ profession was opened for all people \u2013 she betrayed."
