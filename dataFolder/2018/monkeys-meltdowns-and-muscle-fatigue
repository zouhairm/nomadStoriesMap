Text: "I'm having my first anxiety attack. \n\nIt\u2019s the last thing I expected\
  \ when I\u2019d booked our exotic trip eight weeks before. We are standing in the\
  \ Sacred Monkey Forest Sanctuary in Ubud, surrounded by at least fifty monkeys in\
  \ all directions, brazenly grabbing food from backpacks and fighting over the scraps.\
  \ Looking at the innocent photos on the leaflet, it\u2019s easy to forget that these\
  \ are wild animals. However ten minutes through our peaceful wander around the beautiful\
  \ Tomb Raider-like temples with enchanting tree vines snaking through the complex,\
  \ we are quickly reminded. I never knew I was so afraid of monkeys. Welcome to wonderful\
  \ Indonesia.\n\nOur series of unexpected events started on our second day when our\
  \ flight from Jakarta to Lombok was cancelled at the last minute because Gunung\
  \ Rinjani, the second highest volcano in Indonesia, had erupted. The same Rinjani\
  \ that we had booked a three day trek to explore the following day. Good. Fast forward\
  \ 24 hours and instead of a two hour leisurely cruise at 30,000 feet, we endured\
  \ a turbulent flight to Bali, a night in Kuta (the Magaluf of the East), a drive\
  \ to the port in the south east of Bali, a very overloaded speedboat to Gili T,\
  \ and an unstable public ferry from Gili T to Bangsal in Lombok. \n\nThis was followed\
  \ by three days that tested us to our limits. Climbing Mount Rinjani is definitely\
  \ not for the faint hearted. The sickness, sunburn, blisters, and muscle fatigue\
  \ were simply par for the course. During our hike we battled near impossible inclines,\
  \ freezing conditions, and wind so strong it nearly knocked us off our feet. Half\
  \ way through the first day my partner turned to me and said, \u2018This is not\
  \ a f***ing holiday!\u2019. There were more than a few occasions I was so exhausted\
  \ I wanted to sit down and cry. \n\nBefore our visit, I'd dreamed of luscious green\
  \ rice paddies, ancient Balinese temples, and untouched beaches. Of course we did\
  \ see all these amazing sights and experienced wonderful food, spiritual yoga classes,\
  \ and snorkelling off the shoreline. We loved sharing these stories on our return,\
  \ but even more rewarding was sharing the unexpected experiences we had along the\
  \ way. Meeting new people we would never have met at home, having to quickly learn\
  \ to be ok with uncertainty, and keeping each other sane by laughing at ourselves\
  \ when all we want to do is scream. My partner was right, it wasn\u2019t a f***ing\
  \ holiday. It was unexpectedly the ultimate adventure."
