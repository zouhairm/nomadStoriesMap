Text: "Here\u2019s something I never told my mum. The short story of how the 18 year\
  \ old me crossed 5 Scandinavian and Eastern European boarders with no passport.\
  \ \nSummer 2011. My best friends and I were on a 6 hours layover at Brussels\u2019\
  \ airport. We had just woken up from a nap when I realised my bum bag with my passport,\
  \ wallet, boarding passes, some cash and ciggies had just been stolen. \nWhile half\
  \ of us were scouring the terminal\u2019s corners, bins and toilets in pursuit of\
  \ my little holy grail, the other half was checking CCTV, only to find out we had\
  \ been smart enough to pick a blind spot to set up our little airport camp. \nMuch\
  \ later that day, we were on a van in Tallinn, heading to Vilnius and I hadn\u2019\
  t quite yet understood how I had just boarded two different flights with no sort\
  \ of ID whatsoever.\nThe road woke me up in Vilnius and I called the Embassy straight\
  \ way. I could either go to Warsaw and get my passport done or go straight back\
  \ to Portugal with a temporary ID, issued only for that purpose. Not exactly what\
  \ you\u2019d expect for your first day of holidays. I said I\u2019d call them back,\
  \ but I never did. \nAfter Lithuania, we headed to Denmark by van. On our way, we\
  \ were pulled over at the polish border, but the police were looking for cigarettes\
  \ and vodka, not an 18 year old with no documents. At this point my friends were\
  \ already calling me \u201CIllegal\u201D, sneaking from country to country on the\
  \ back of a van. \nWe were taking the ferryboat to Sweden the morning after and\
  \ we had a plan; I'd pretend to be asleep on the last row of the van, and if IDs\
  \ were asked, I'd present an expired one from a friend of mine. I know\u2026 Back\
  \ then it seemed like a good plan. Luckily, no ID was required to board and we could\
  \ finally nap on the prow, while a hilarious sun burn worked its way on my face\
  \ to make the nickname Illegal stick.  \nUltimately, on the bridge that connects\
  \ Sweden and Denmark we were asked for IDs. Up to this day I think about how the\
  \ simple words \u201Cwe\xB4re travelling under an EU funded project\u201D saved\
  \ me from bigger troubles, and we were easily able to enter the country. It was\
  \ true by the way.\nIn Denmark, when our holidays were about to come to an end,\
  \ I finally got the temporary ID that would allow me to fly back to Portugal and\
  \ never tell my mum that for two weeks I was at an eminent risk of being detained\
  \ for travelling with no ID or other form of identifying myself as an EU citizen,\
  \ who could rightfully visit the countries I visited and cross the boarders I crossed."
