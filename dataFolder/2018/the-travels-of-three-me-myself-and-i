Text: "Okay, I didn't plan it through as well as I should have. This trip for me was\
  \ very last minute. I was studying abroad in Ireland and a few friends and I have\
  \ decided to take one final adventure to Scotland. I joined in on the trip about\
  \ two weeks before we left and so I had to quickly book my bus and plane tickets\
  \ as well as the hostel we were staying at. I found the time of departure for the\
  \ busses and plane and, having good experience with one of the bus companies, I\
  \ decided to take that bus from Galway to Dublin, where I was flying out from. My\
  \ friends were using a different bus but were expecting to leave 15 minutes after\
  \ mine. I didn't mind riding on the bus alone- it was great for thinking and mentally\
  \ preparing for this trip.\nI tried not to use my phone on the bus as I did not\
  \ want to kill my battery. Once I got to the airport I scurried through the security\
  \ check in order to secure my place at the gate. Once I made it through, I realized\
  \ that I had missed multiple calls and texts from my friends. I called them, asking\
  \ if they made it through security yet, only to find out that their bus wasn't even\
  \ in Dublin yet! At this point, there was about 30 minutes or so until the gate\
  \ would close. I asked them what I should do. \"Just get on the plane, we will figure\
  \ something out,\" they told me. I felt bad leaving without them, but I did as they\
  \ encouraged me to do and got on the plane. \nThey didn't make it in time.\nUnfortunately,\
  \ they just got to the gate minutes after it closed and they weren't allowed on.\
  \ So there I was, heading to Scotland all alone. Once I landed I talked to my friends\
  \ and we figured out a plan. They decided to stay in a hotel and then join me the\
  \ next day. I did not plan any of this to happen and I wonder how great it would\
  \ have been had we all been together our first night in Scotland. Yet, I was proud\
  \ of myself for not freaking out and managing to get by alone. In the end, I fell\
  \ in love with the city I was visiting and I knew that I could do this again. I\
  \ definitely see myself taking an independent trip someday soon, now that I have\
  \ this experience to look back on."
