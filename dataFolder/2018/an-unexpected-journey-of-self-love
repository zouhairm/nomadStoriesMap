Text: "I was meant to travel to Central America and every day I am so thankful for\
  \ the opportunity. Coming to a foreign place alone I knew I would be uncomfortable\
  \ at times because I'd be pushed and I had things I planned to work on personally.\
  \ I was looking forward to the growth, but of course I had no idea how I'd be challenged.\
  \ I was excited to come to CA because the people look like me, even without the\
  \ language skills I knew I'd feel at home.\n\nEnter me: I'd been on a natural hair\
  \ journey for a year embracing my natural curls and tan from several previous vacations,\
  \ basically just not feeling like I have to conform all the time. Coming here, I\
  \ expected to be embraced and find all types of hair goodies; I was wrong. Any store\
  \ I walked into had aisles of box perms and very few moisturizing products; those\
  \ products kill your hair in order to straighten it. There were also many aisles\
  \ with skin bleaching products, which is equally as sad and unhealthy. Many times\
  \ I witnessed locals carrying umbrellas in the heat to avoid tans. The self-hate\
  \ there is real.  I was the exact opposite of what is considered attractive, or\
  \ at least that's what it felt like. It was interesting because before the trip\
  \ I\u2019d never put too much stock into my looks. I'd like to think I have a great\
  \ personality so even if I wasn't attractive I'd still go through life with the\
  \ same experiences but I don\u2019t know. Colorism is not something that can easily\
  \ be put in words but you feel it nonetheless.\nI have not always been aware of\
  \ color. I didn\u2019t grow up around a lot of POC and my parents never talked about\
  \ it. When I got to high school I was considered light skin and it was clear it\
  \ was a positive attribute whereas my best friend was not, so we were always compared.\
  \ This experience made me sympathetic to the experiences of darker women though\
  \ I'd never been on the other side. I\u2019m appreciative of this journey,  it made\
  \ me wake up every day and present myself to the world when I didn\u2019t feel pretty.\
  \ Because honestly, who cares? Looking back on all my pictures that didn\u2019t\
  \ get posted because I was self conscious, I\u2019m disappointed in myself. For\
  \ a year, I tried to embrace natural, but clearly there is still work to be done.\
  \ I have always had high self-esteem, however this experience showed me it is not\
  \ untouchable. I thought I looked ugly every day because that was the message I\
  \ felt I was being sent, but I looked fine because I looked like me but somehow\
  \ I'd forgotten. What a beautiful experience."
