Text: "Once and for all i was terrified with my accident. It happened a few months\
  \ back and i was a victim of leg injury and underwent many operations. Taking physiotherapy\
  \ daily was a headache and running away from it was even miserable because of my\
  \ zest to recover quickly. My travel story came after I was semi recovered. I could\
  \ walk but couldn't run. I could cycle but i could hardly jump but as fate has it\
  \ I made it to Darjeeling.\nWe, yes we, my friends from my college and my respected\
  \ sir, we decided to trek in Singalila National Park, Darjeeling, West Bengal. My\
  \ travel news came as a shock to my parents, they have been so protective about\
  \ me after my accident. I decided to undertook this journey only to see weather\
  \ i have the courage to get away from my fears.\nI was on my way from my home town,\
  \ when the first hurdle was to jump on a moving train. I leapt and got at once without\
  \ any suffering. Then came the train's seat. I was alloted the Upper Berth and i\
  \ had to climb there, with my legs and the ladder very narrow i once thought my\
  \ challenge started right from this moment. Though my friends and sir told me to\
  \ take the lower berth, i tried and i made it to my berth. The fear was always on\
  \ my mind as to my decision about getting to the edge could cause me miserably.\
  \ I was a little sassy but not nervous.\n I made it to siliguri. We took mobile\
  \ vehicle to get to Darjeeling and oh dear!! the views i witnessed while traveling\
  \ seems heavenly pleasures bestowed upon you. From there the events and hurdles\
  \ i underwent was unlikely delicate to my newly operated legs. But my decision to\
  \ have all this and escape my fears, made me do it all. \nPersistence, Courage and\
  \ the zest to do something wakes the inner you and makes you do such decisions that\
  \ can push you to the edge. Here the decision i took pushed me to the edge, my limit\
  \ was tested but the scenic beauty and obviously the rare Red Panda sighting made\
  \ me go that extra mile."
