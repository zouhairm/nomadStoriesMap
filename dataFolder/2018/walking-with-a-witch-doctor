Text: "The landscape in Matabele land is hilly and expansive. It is littered with\
  \ large boulders that immediately seemed to shrink us as we finally stepped out\
  \ of the car, having waited for the dust that the wheels kept kicking up to clear.\
  \ I was there with my companion Joshua, a traditional healer, and although this\
  \ was not our first encounter, this was his first time bringing me to the shrine\
  \ where he carried out most of the rituals that had made him a fairly popular figure\
  \ in this small Matopo community. We drove 8 hours from the city in the dry heat\
  \ and the closer we got to the village the more scant the scenery became, we had\
  \ not seen a single hut in an hour. We finally came to a stop in a spot that was\
  \ ordinary to the untrained eye, but as Joshua explained, was the entrance to an\
  \ ancient forest, it was here that Joshua carried out his rites and held monthly\
  \ all-night prayers to the local gods. A lean woman with a turban head wrap that\
  \ matched the azure colour of the sky exactly appeared to lunge out of nowhere and\
  \ into the door as soon as Joshua opened it. From what I gathered she was one of\
  \ his clients and whatever he had done for her must have been very important, by\
  \ the width of her smile. She had been expecting us and was ululating loudly in\
  \ greeting.\n\nJoshua was used to the attention from adoring devotees it seemed,\
  \ but he beamed anyway. He shook the woman\u2019s hand and they talked briefly,\
  \ cordially, before he led me towards the trail in the forest that has been sacred\
  \ to the Ndebele people for centuries. The dust that still lingered in the air grit\
  \ our teeth as we talked and Joshua explained that he did not usually bring non-believers\
  \ here,\n\u201CMy father and my father\u2019s father and on and on have been buried\
  \ here. Their spirits live in these trees.\u201D Joshua gestures up at the gnarled\
  \ Mopani branches as we walk between them. The air was still and the Mopani trees\
  \ that towered over us had a sweet, heady scent about them. \nAs he spoke I heard\
  \ the rustle of leaves, a little far off from where we were walking, and noticed\
  \ that we were, indeed, not alone. A small group of pilgrims appeared to also be\
  \ on their way to the shrine, they were dressed in white and were eerily silent,\
  \ facing forward as if in meditation. I noticed that a  few of them were rotating\
  \ beads around their wrists, as if counting them, Joshua explained later that it\
  \ was a form of prayer, and that he had made those beads himself as part of his\
  \ duty as a healer. \n\u201CYes, I gave them their magic.\u201D"
