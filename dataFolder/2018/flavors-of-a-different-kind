Text: "We were standing on the edge of the cliff that looks over Praia a Mare, watching\
  \ from a distance the long black beach and the threatening grey clouds that announced\
  \ a rainy afternoon in the north of Calabria. \n\nAlessandro seems to me like the\
  \ colors of his hometown; calm and introverted, he\u2019s not the typical Italian\
  \ cliche of loudness. We met a year ago in the midst of the Japanese spring, the\
  \ same season for our friendship. Now it was autumn, the long stems of saracchio\
  \ trembled in the wind, and the cold breeze of southern Italy reminded us of bitter\
  \ feelings. But we had each other. We stood there watching the view in silent complicity\
  \ as the waves crashed into the dark sand and white gleams shined with the sun despite\
  \ the blackness. A honk took us out of our contemplation. His dad was in the car\
  \ waiting for us. His family would host dinner for us that night. \n\nItalian cuisine\
  \ is acclaimed worldwide, but the reason becomes evident when you have your stomach\
  \ exploding due to an Italian mamma cooking for you. Dinner began with a massive\
  \ volume of pasta. \u2018Oh, I won't finish this,\u2019 I thought to my skinny-self\
  \ while struggling with each bite. I was halfway through and feeling confident when\
  \ mamma said: \u201CI've heard you like eggplant, vero?\u201D With a full mouth,\
  \ I smiled and nodded. \u201CI've made parmigiana for you!\u201D I thought it would\
  \ be for next day until a big spoon served a vast amount onto the empty half of\
  \ my plate. \u2018Cazzo!\u2019, I thought to myself, proud of being able to swear\
  \ in Italian, but fearful of not being able to ingest all that food. Afterwards,\
  \ she served insalata di polpo e pesce. Spaghetti allo scoglio followed, accompanied\
  \ by polpette di patate. A variety of artichoke plates came after, Carciofi Tripletta:\
  \ Romana, fried and au gratin. \n\n\u201CBella, you've tasted the very best of southern\
  \ Italy,\u201D he said proudly. Cliche might state that Italians will come to you\
  \ with seductive words, but Alex is the opposite, reserved and hermetic. Nevertheless,\
  \ he calls me Bella. Italians have a particularly good capacity for finding beauty\
  \ in all their surroundings; in cuisine, in nature, in people. My time in Italy\
  \ has been so much more than pasta and pizza (of which, I won't deny, I've had vast\
  \ amounts). Travelling this country goes beyond contemplating its art and countless\
  \ historical sites. It means involving oneself in a culture and embracing the privilege\
  \ of feeling like I have a family here. \n\nOne more plate came, honey struffoli\
  \ because we couldn't miss dolce."
