Text: "Sometimes I think that History books are responsible for people not wanting\
  \ to visit some countries. Luckily, living for a year near the Balkans allowed me\
  \ to travel to a place I had never imagined knowing: Montenegro. The route began\
  \ by visiting Europe\u2019s third largest lake: Skadar Lake. Never before I had\
  \ driven on roads like those which led to that freshwater concentration located\
  \ between Montenegro and Albania.They were narrow dirt roads and the curves were\
  \ so closed that I had to backtrack with the car to not fall down for the slope.\
  \ The insecurity I felt was reduced thanks to the panoramic view I had. Skadar Lake\
  \ was calm, and the sun\u2019s rays reflected on it. At that moment, I understood\
  \ why it was so worth going to see it: an islet with the silhouette of a woman emerged\
  \ from the deepest and, in the far away, a row of mountains was faded by distance.\
  \ Its outline merged with the clear blue sky, and if you looked carefully, it resembled\
  \ an impressionist painting of quick brushes by the colours\u2019 juxtaposition.\
  \ On my way back, I veered off other paths which were even narrower than the previous\
  \ ones and where the orange leaves formed the roof of a tunnel filled with spring\
  \ colours. Little by little, I was finding some lonely houses with worn white walls,\
  \ 80s ranch vans and some rusty pots next to the neglected garden. Leaving behind\
  \ one of them, I came across three farmers in the area. They were astonished to\
  \ see a car circulating along those paths so they stopped me. The last thing I expected\
  \ was they will speak Spanish, so I told them shyly in English \u2018How are you?\u2019\
  . For my surprise, two of them spoke Spanish. I couldn\u2019t stop wondering myself\
  \ how those locals, who were almost 65 years old and were so far away from the hectic\
  \ and chaotic world, knew my language. None of them had been to Spain before and\
  \ the only thing they knew about my country was football, especially, the Bar\xE7\
  a and Real Madrid football teams. Talking about Mourinho or Messi made me establish\
  \ a link with these three men. A sport as so well-known as it is football allowed\
  \ us to know a little more about our customs because, in the end, football is culture,\
  \ a subject so banal but common for millions of people. However, at 2,400 kilometres\
  \ from home what I discovered was that what really makes you able to establish links\
  \ with people from other countries is not only the topics that bring us closer,\
  \ but the power to communicate through language., but the power to communicate through\
  \ language."
