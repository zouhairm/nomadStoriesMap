Text: "I was holding a map that a nice guy with dreadlocks gave me in the hostel.\
  \ I was folding and unfolding it all day so it didn't get fancier (believe it or\
  \ not it is much easier for me to have a paper map than Google Maps). And then I\
  \ met this nice Spanish girl literally two blocks away from the Arc de Triomf. \"\
  Perd\xF3n, \xBFd\xF3nde est\xE1 calle...?\" I felt lost for a second. Maybe because\
  \ of my appearance or because it was already dark the girl thought that I am a local\
  \ and live in Barcelona! I smiled and said in Spanish that I don't know. And then\
  \ I handed her my paper map and said that she can use it if she wants. The girl\
  \ laughed and told me, \"Ah, eres turista...\" She thanked me and continued walking\
  \ in the same direction without knowing where to go.\nAnd I knew where I was going.\
  \ I was coming back from the best place that I saw during the last 11 years - the\
  \ sea. The Balearic Sea in Barcelona is a teaser. It's whispering to you in December\
  \ that you need to come closer, to put your hand in the water, to feel like it caresses\
  \ the stones on the shore. I was still dreaming when I got to the alley nest to\
  \ the Arc de Triomf. And there the life only started. It was only 7 pm. People were\
  \ walking with their dogs. The dogs were not even barking. There was an impression\
  \ that here everybody knows each other even little puppies. From different sides\
  \ I could hear different types of music. Locals were singing Christmas carols and\
  \ inviting to the church, travelling musicians were playing guitars right under\
  \ the arch. You may think that it's too much noise and too many people but it felt\
  \ like home. It was pure harmony.\nI took the bus after walking 40 000 steps. It\
  \ was crowded enough but, according to Ukrainian standards, not crowded at all.\
  \ There were no free seats left so I stood next to a kind-looking old lady. She\
  \ looked and me and melted. In a second she smiled and said in Spanish that the\
  \ next stop is hers but she never stands up too early - when drivers stop the bus,\
  \ she can fall. I was overexcited. I think my cheeks were hurting because of constant\
  \ smiling. Again people thought that I was local! It couldn't get better. \nBut\
  \ my last day in Barcelona I got an upgrade in the metro. A girl came to me and\
  \ started asking me in Catalan which stop was better for her. The only thing that\
  \ I could do was smile and nod. I think she understood that I wasn't a good choice\
  \ for giving instructions in her mother tongue. It's good when you have B2 in Spanish\
  \ but doesn't always work there."
