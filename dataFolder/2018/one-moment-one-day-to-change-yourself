Text: "One moment, one day to change yourself!\n\nIt was my last year on Bachelor's\
  \ degree, I was doing my research about Deaf culture, how normal parameters has\
  \ excluded and tried to normalize a difference, how our society has developed and\
  \ taught tags and has defined normalcy, and how language (body nor verbal) can create\
  \ or erase barriers between us. It was my last opportunity to attend as student\
  \ to the International Film Festival of Cartagena (FICCI), and thanks to my family\
  \ I did it. Also it was the first time that I would travel alone, and the first\
  \ time that I was going to this beautiful city, with colonial and romantic inspiration\
  \ at the Walled City; I knew that colleagues were coming but I did not have connection\
  \ with them, I flew to Cartagena and at the airport I already felt so lonely, so\
  \ lost, I didn\u2019t have idea where could I find information, nor my tickets,\
  \ anything. I was so afraid that something badly was going to happen to me, I felt\
  \ distrusted, different, so stressed, and so anxious... I\u2019ve arrived to my\
  \ hostel, left my backpack and started to meet this mysterious, full of history,\
  \ colorfully city but at this moment I didn\u2019t realized all about this magical\
  \ city. \n\nI walked a lot, several blocks until I realized that I was not at the\
  \ Walled City anymore, that I had no idea where I was ... I asked several people\
  \ where was this place called \u2018House 57\u2019 but I was afraid of them, I thought\
  \ that I was the \u2018other\u2019 that I was studying for my thesis' degree, and\
  \ then finally I've realized that because of all that stereotypes that society puts\
  \ on our ordinary life, we create this fears and life is not like that. \n\nAnd\
  \ then I stopped, I breathe, and prayed to my angels and I just started to smile,\
  \ as simple as that, smile with your face, with your heart, with your mind. And\
  \ one more time, I asked to a girl that was walking across where could I find this\
  \ address, she smiled back and said: \"Hey, come on. Don\u2019t worry so much! Come\
  \ with me\".  \n\nOn this moment I understood that despite all of our differences\
  \ the barriers between us are because of ourselves, and we can create nor eliminate\
  \ them; how we react about something or someone only depend to ourselves, to make\
  \ each other better, recreate ourselves on the best way \u2013and the differences\
  \ are not bad, it makes our life better. I enjoyed these movies as never before,\
  \ at this trip I met a lot of people who taught me, and I finally change myself\
  \ to understand and feel that we are equals."
