Text: "Somehow I feel like I have just woken up. \n\nFor the last 8 years since university,\
  \ all I have really done is my job. I have constantly talked about work. I have\
  \ progressed from a graduate to running multiple divisions. I set up a new office\
  \ in the States. It all just happened in a flash. I was on a speeding train, with\
  \ a vague plan to perhaps get off at some point. \n\nBut the stops kept coming,\
  \ and I kept going. \n\nBack in November last year, a collision of events jolted\
  \ me out off the train at a stop I hadn't necessarily planned on getting off at.\
  \ My company almost went bankrupt. I was owed tens of thousands of pounds that I\
  \ was unlikely to ever see again. My colleagues were all being fired. I had been\
  \ let down by the key founders of the business I had worked so hard and honestly\
  \ for. \n\nI needed to disconnect. \n\nLuckily I had put a bit of money aside, and\
  \ had a boat load of air miles, so I made a decision to quit my job, and to go cycling\
  \ around New Zealand. \n\nCycling is the best way I have found to disconnect. To\
  \ me disconnecting is the best way of connecting with a new place. \n\nWhen you\
  \ are cycling you are free, in control, disconnected from a house, a mortgage, the\
  \ sound of an engine, your phone. It is just you, your legs, the road. Through that\
  \ disconnection you are able to connect with what is facing you. \n\nIn between\
  \ the tourist points there is the real New Zealand. \n\nFor every Queenstown there\
  \ is a deserted, open road. For every helicopter ride there is a mountain to climb.\
  \ For every Wanaka there is a hidden, unguided path to stop and embrace the still,\
  \ cool mountain air. There is the road in between, the journey, and this is the\
  \ hidden gem of the cyclist. \n\nI saw two sides of New Zealand. I saw the connected,\
  \ and I saw the disconnected. \n\nThe connected go from spot to spot. They are the\
  \ herd. They connect to WiFi. They crave destinations.\n\nThe disconnected are not\
  \ thinking of the next spot. They are alone. They disconnect. They eat with locals.\
  \ They embrace the journey. \n\nI guess I'm writing this for the people who need\
  \ some kind of respite. People in need of a jolt. Something has happened in your\
  \ life or your career and you need some time to think and to reassess. Some time\
  \ to disconnect. \n\nMy journey connected me to 750km of road. 7500m of climbing.\
  \ 8 new poems. 3 chapters of my book. Countless new ideas.  \n\nCycling New Zealand\
  \ was the perfect remedy. \n\nNow I am ready to take my next train."
