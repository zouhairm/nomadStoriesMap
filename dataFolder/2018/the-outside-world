Text: "Tony. He introduced himself politely to his english-speaking visitors. I pleaded\
  \ with him to hear his real name. \u201CChertchai\u201D he said softly to me. Bumps\
  \ riddled the roads and dust filled the air as we started our journey deep into\
  \ the jungles of Chiang Mai. With two hours gone, the truck came to a halting stop\
  \ at the very top of a hill. I looked up to see a group of boys, appearing to be\
  \ between the ages of 12 and 16 wearing variations of ripped shirts and mismatched\
  \ attire. Their bare feet, legs and arms were covered in dried mud and their hair\
  \ was unruly.  A gentle trunk reached and curled around one of the boys pulling\
  \ him in closer and lifting him slightly off of the ground in a playful manner.\
  \ Mahout,\u201D Chertchai offered,  \u201Cderived from the Hindi word \u201CMahaut\u201D\
  \ means \"elephant driver.\u201D \u201CHow many hours a day are they here with the\
  \ elephants?\u201D I asked. Chertchai\u2019s response caused my brows to raise and\
  \ furrow. \u201CAlways. This is their home\u201D he said. My eyes swept back and\
  \ forth across the scene soaking it all in. I was taken aback by how little they\
  \ seemed to live with. Many are from the Karen hill tribes and begin their duties\
  \ as mahouts as boys. Speaking only their hill language, they are unable to get\
  \ any other jobs in Thailand. They have never been into the cities or a grocery\
  \ store. They have never read a book or watched a movie. When they sleep, they don't\
  \ sleep in a cozy warm house with beds and blankets shielded from the rain or mosquitoes.\
  \ They endured the wild of the jungle just as their giant companions did. My life\
  \ seemed to flash before my eyes and everything I perceived as \u201Cnormal\u201D\
  \ shifted. I was now in a completely different reality that was someone else\u2019\
  s version of \u201Cnormal.\u201D They couldn't fathom the life that I have led and\
  \ I couldn't fathom theirs\u2019. While I stepped into that jungle with the sole\
  \ intent to meet elephants, I walked out with so much more. My eyes were opened\
  \ to a world much bigger than my own. A fire was sparked within me and a desire\
  \ ignited to teach people like the mahouts about the world outside and even more\
  \ to teach the outside world about them."
