Text: "Most of us grown up listening to the stories of heaven,the land of god. But\
  \ have you ever visited heaven?\nI can say yes. If there is heaven it surely lies\
  \ on earth. Which is located in india as 'kashmir'.\nHigh Mountains,sloppy peaks,chilling\
  \ springs,unspoiled forests.That adds different charm in the beauty of Kashmir.\n\
  God has sanctified all the beauty of nature on Kashmir only. Hundreds of peaks covered\
  \ in snow,sneaking through the clouds.\nEye pleasing landscapes and a panorama of\
  \ snow-capped mountain range. If this is not the heaven then what else?\nBut the\
  \ road to the heaven was not that easy for me. I truly believe that an opportunities\
  \ came and go everyday in your life, \nand you should have the sight to see it and\
  \ grab one. I got an opportunity as the whole month of mountaineering camp in kashmir\
  \ valley,\nand of course I took it.\nI took admission in camp, prepared everything,\
  \ booked the train to go and a flight to return about 6 months in advance.\nEverything\
  \ was going perfect, it was something like a dream come true.\nI was very excited.\
  \ This was my first ever experience of traveling alone.\nbut as two of my second\
  \ year annual exam papers got postponed to the month of camp. Everything started\
  \ to fade away. I didn't know what to do.\nIf i had told this to my parents I knew\
  \ they wouldn't have let me go to a camp over my academics and future. I had to\
  \ chose my self, \nI can't just let go everything i planned, so I decided not to\
  \ tell anyone about it and go to the camp. That's the decision i took.\na decision\
  \ that pushed me to my limits of my knowledge, understandings and experiences.\n\
  After that finally the day of my departure came and my journey towards the heaven\
  \ started. In the way I traveled across the country through 6 different states and\
  \ approximately 2.5km high from sea level in just 2 days, through the  mountain\
  \ peaks surrounding all four sides and the Lidder river flowing gently besides road\
  \ as guiding me to my destination,I reached the camp site.\nEveryone came from different\
  \ parts of the india, with different languages and different cultures, still we\
  \ became good friends till now,\nDuring our camp we were scheduled to roam around\
  \ city everyday,explore new paths to see the heaven from our perspective.It was\
  \ a pretty good and challenging month of my life.I completed my camp with an A grade\
  \ certificate and a golden badge.On my return journey I was filled with joy that\
  \ i took my opportunity and made a good decision. Learned a lot from my journey\
  \ to heaven."
