Text: "Travel stories are fun to write. Tatanagar has been the place where I made\
  \ a local connection . My journey to tata was quite tough because one month back\
  \ I had an appendicitis operation. But anyhow I made it a point to reach there.\
  \ \nThe day I reached the first thing I did was to make a local connection with\
  \ the people out there so that they can help me to travel across Tata. I hired that\
  \ person as my guide so that I an take a city tour. He took me to different places,\
  \ different cultured societies and much more. I made a list of things and details\
  \ about it. Then from there the first place I visited was Rose Garden, as I would\
  \ like to call it. This garden was only filled with grass and roses of only one\
  \ colour which was red. This garden was so calm, pleasant, quiet, noiseless, restful\
  \ and so peaceful. Although we weren\u2019t allowed to pluck roses, I quietly did.\
  \ . I didn\u2019t want to spend much time in a place so from there, I moved onto\
  \ my next place. I had less time and so many places to visit. So from there I moved\
  \ on to my next destination which was a religious place. The I had less time and\
  \ so many places to visit. So from there I moved on to my next destination which\
  \ was a religious place. The Sai Baba Mandir (Temple) was in the outskirts of Tata.\
  \ I like to visit holy places and visiting it was soothing, untroubled, and not\
  \ disturbing at all. I have been exposed to holy places from a very young age and\
  \ so I was accustomed to all the things like washing your hands first, having natural\
  \ water provided by the place, and we should have a pure heart with no harsh feelings.\

  \ in life to travel as much as I can for personal development as well as to be mentally\
  \ fit. \nI was done with sightseeing, I was done with food, I was done with every\
  \ little thing I\u2019d thought of doing in Tata. I\u2019ve always wanted to travel\
  \ around the world. And sometimes you just need that escape from escaping. And I\
  \ think I earned my right to have audacious holiday in winter. Sometimes that\u2019\
  s all we need to decompress from this crazy world. \nAnd this is how I made a local\
  \ connection and good memories"
