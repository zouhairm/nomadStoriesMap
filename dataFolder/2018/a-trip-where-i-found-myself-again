Text: "My heart started accelerating, as the tiers of the bus started gaining the\
  \ pace. The first time solo traveler, the mother and the claustrophobic inside me\
  \ wanted to stop the bus right away and run back to my comfort zone, but I continued\
  \ the journey anyway.\n\nMasked men dancing on a psychedelic tunes on YouTube intrigued\
  \ me to embark on a journey to unknown, a remote Himalayan village in Banjar valley.\
  \ Knowing about my trip, the expression on my neighbor's face in the bus made me\
  \ think for a while, that in quest of finding my answers was I pushing myself too\
  \ hard?\n\nHesitantly walking through the snow clad, crooked narrow lanes I could\
  \ hear the drum beats getting louder towards Bahu village, Bahu is a traditional\
  \ Himalayan community with vernacular houses which are believed to be more than\
  \ 1000 years old; I finally saw the masked men dancing on the psychedelic tunes\
  \ in \u201CFaguli\u201D festival. The locals willingly shared the stories behind\
  \ the celebration with me. They told that the mask is carved by villagers and worn\
  \ in order to scare away the evil powers from their valley and then they swear those\
  \ evil powers to safeguard their valley and people. Usually, assiduous hill women\
  \ leisurely gathered on terraced fields and corrugated rooftop of the houses to\
  \ enjoy the act.\n\nOverzealous audience, men wearing skirts weaved with grass,\
  \ colorful headgear, big drums, trumpets, masks and their rhythmically moving footsteps;\
  \ all this was happening in front of my eyes in the backdrop of majestic Himalayas\
  \ layered with snow, it was no less than a dream to a mother of a four year old\
  \ who has gathered the courage to step out alone after 5 long years, this moment\
  \ was liberating. \n\nSuddenly I was rattled back to reality as one of the masked\
  \ men had gone out of control, he seems to be trying hard to contain his energy,\
  \ and he started murmuring something, when finally locals were able to calm him\
  \ down, I came to know that the man was a shaman and he was possessed by some energy.\
  \ Locals believed that a Shaman would bless the valley and foretell about any calamity.\
  \ First time in my life I got so close to the concept of shamanism. Their culture\
  \ and beliefs were so different from the world we live in today, and they were extremely\
  \ proud of their identity. \n\nStrangely, in those faraway unusual surroundings,\
  \ slowly I was getting closer to myself."
