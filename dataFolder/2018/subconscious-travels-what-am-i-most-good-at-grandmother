Text: "\"What am I most good at, Grandmother?\"\nNo response.\n\"What am I most good\
  \ at, Grandmother?\"\nI began to have a remembrance of being in the high-school\
  \ band.\nI tried out the clarinet, I didn't enjoy it.\nI tried out drums, it was\
  \ complicated. \nMy mom booked me piano lessons, but I hated practice and my teacher\
  \ Thalia always came over when celebrity gossip TV show \"Entertainment Tonight\"\
  \ was on. I quit.\nI took a pottery class, one class.\nI remembered taking dance\
  \ classes, they were too structured.\nI started to think about how much I love unstructured,\
  \ freeform dance. \n\"Am I most good at dancing, Grandmother?\"\nAll of a sudden\
  \ I could feel the medicine repairing my weak knees. \nI wasn't having visions of\
  \ my knees being worked on, I was feeling a force inside my skin, in with the blood\
  \ and muscles, healing my knees!\nI stayed with this for a while, it was astounding!\n\
  My teacher, Mikis said that my body would try to distract me but he also said that\
  \ the right answer is the one that makes you FEEL. \nI am feeling!\n\"Am I most\
  \ good at dancing?\"\nMy right knee and thigh made a really strong twitch, one that\
  \ could have been seen across the room. Was my body giving me answers? I've drank\
  \ this plant brew many times and have never had a visionary experience, maybe this\
  \ is my way of getting answers, through my body. \n\"Grandmother, is dancing what\
  \ I am most good at?!\"\nMy feet and ankles shot out to the side.\nMy feet then\
  \ went into a deep arch as if ballerina slippers had been put on my feet and I was\
  \ on stage about to begin a performance.\n\"Am I to be a ballerina, Grandmother?\"\
  \nIt seemed idealistic and crazy but it was the answer that was making me physically\
  \ FEEL! \nHow the energy was moving through my body, I wondered if I'm meant to\
  \ be a healer or maybe a channeller. \n\"Am I most good at energy work, Grandmother?\"\
  \nAll of a sudden I had Justin Bieber laying down next to me! I was gently tapping\
  \ his chest, doing a form of energy work over his heart! \nMy thoughts went to the\
  \ masculine and the feminine, about having a partner one day. \n\"Am I most good\
  \ at being JUSTIN BIEBER'S partner, Grandmother?\"\nI went into our imaginary future.\n\
  Would we live together or would I want my own home?\nWould I want him to buy me\
  \ my home or would I pay for it myself?\nWould I really want to be with him or do\
  \ I just like the idea of him? \nMaybe, I sang, \"I just need somebody to looooove...yeaa!\"\
  \nI was distracted.\nI need my answer!\n\u201CWHAT AM I MOST GOOD AT, GRANDMOTHER?\u201D\
  \nOur journey was called to a close."
