Text: "\u201CThey grind it up into powder. It\u2019s supposed to improve your health,\u201D\
  \ Dean looked up from attacking his chocolate cake to flex, \u201Cand strength.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI was beginning to suspect that velvet wasn\u2019t furry fabric.\n\n\u201C\
  It\u2019ll also give you a boost in the bedroom.\u201D Dean wiggled his eyebrows\
  \ at his wife Jan.\n\nMy husband grinned. I stared at my cake, failing to fight\
  \ off the image of our host in a rippling, purple shirt. \n\n\nIt was our last night\
  \ on the Central Otago Rail Trail, New Zealand. For five days we followed the decommissioned\
  \ railway line through vast, dry farmland dotted with luminous patches of irrigated\
  \ green. A constant chill wind swirled off the snowcapped Rock and Pillar Ranges.\
  \ \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s gorse, a weed,\u201D Jan nodded at her beer when I asked about\
  \ the masses of yellow flowers crawling over the undulating brown hills. \u201C\
  But we get our revenge.\u201D I sipped the golden beverage. Light and crisp, with\
  \ undertones of environmentalism and a hint of smugness. Perfect.  \n\nAlthough\
  \ 15,000 people cycle the trail each year, each night we checked in alone. Every\
  \ morning we buttered our toast in the corner of an empty breakfast room. I had\
  \ imagined lycra-filled comradery, high-fiving other cyclists as we zipped past\
  \ painted wooden kilometre markers \u202695, 96, 97\u2026 Instead, the bike odometer\
  \ silently counted, 50, 60, 70 km as we crunched over coarse grey gravel, startling\
  \ rabbits busy destroying the landscape. \n\n\u201CThe biggest problem with the\
  \ velvet industry is all the ruddy middlemen!\u201D Dean thumped the table, upsetting\
  \ his beer. We were not talking about fabric, but I was still no wiser. \n\nIt could\
  \ have felt empty, or even lonely. But Central Otago provided what other travellers\
  \ could not. We lunched on the edge of paddocks, watching blimp-sized bees meander\
  \ between blooms as curious cows nosed hopefully at our panniers. In Oturehua, we\
  \ were treated to the surprisingly rich history of a town of 26. We dined with locals,\
  \ chatted to shop owners, clinked glasses with farmers.\n\nWe didn\u2019t peddle\
  \ across Central Otago, we were absorbed into it. \n\nAnd velvet, by the way, is\
  \ made from deer antlers."
