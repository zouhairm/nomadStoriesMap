Text: "Julien described the midnight sun like it was a brunbjorn hug that wrapped\
  \ around his waist the length of the attic circle. I wondered how uncomfortably\
  \ close you would have to get to a Norwegian brown bear to experience it's all-encompassing\
  \ warmth. If this wasn't one of his tales, then I thought this was the quintessential\
  \ metaphor for a sun that never sleeps on the other side of winter. I starred in\
  \ wonderment as it naturally coated every living organism at dusk in shades of yellow\
  \ and tangerine. I just loved how he always begun his stories with an imbued sense\
  \ of mystery. The melody of his words echoed like poetry as they fell out of his\
  \ blonde bearded mouth and down past the twinning trees to the other side of Rogaland\
  \ county. I filled my balloon-like lungs with the scent of blackcurrent and raspberry\
  \ flowers, frozen timber wood and oak moss, as we ventured passed the green alder\
  \ tree and goat willow trees. This was Julian's backyard and even though he had\
  \ explored it extensively, the area was one of the few untouched woodlands of Norway.\
  \ \n\"Sammen,\" Julian whispered. \"That's what we believe about the forest, well...\
  \ about everything really. We are all connected; to each other, biologically. To\
  \ the earth, chemically. To the rest of the universe, atomically. We are not figuratively,\
  \ but literally stardust.\" I stopped on top of the festered moss to allow these\
  \ words to sink in. \nI shadowed Julian as he floated carefully around the cascading\
  \ dwarf juniper and crouched down to pluck a tyrtebaer berry from the tiniest of\
  \ trees. He rolled around his silicon hands, playing with it respectfully, until\
  \ sliding it past his palm to the tip of his middle finger to me. \n\"Sammen,\"\
  \ he breathed again. This time I picked up the scent of moon whisky in the air,\
  \ but it evaporated as soon as it had left his lips. We journeyed only a twist and\
  \ turn longer and finally we reached the clearing. Ahh, Preikestolen. \nI edged\
  \ my way over the plateau, stepping cautiously over the pulpit crack and I felt\
  \ a mighty 604 meters taller. I bowed down and peered through the darkened channels\
  \ of Sognefjord, the longest and deepest fjord just North of the Bergen boarder.\
  \ I twisted my body to face the fjord water, tracing cliffs and towering peaks,\
  \ soaking in the watery streaks of silvery blue and I just knew what Julian had\
  \ felt all his life. This was the first time my senses were implicitly alive. It\
  \ was an embodiment of beauty and bliss and the warm, familiar sense of coming home."
