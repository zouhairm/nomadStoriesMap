Text: "Democracy is the easiest lullaby every citizen of Nigeria could sing even while\
  \ asleep.\nBoth sane and insane, even the spirits are made to believe the falsehood\
  \ that; as bad as the political system of the country, that it is democratic.\n\
  Like mirage, it always sound in our ears, but vanishes in the sight of the poor\
  \ masses who has been masked by the fear of more misery from the political tsetse\
  \ flies who with their transparent proboscis suck our livelihood. Yet, with toxic\
  \ cool Pierce, they soothe us with the lullaby: Democracy! Democracy!! Democracy!!!\
  \ In every sectors of the economy the poor are always stranded like weed growing\
  \ in the furrow, as justice is being sold to the highest bidder. I wrestled with\
  \ this thought in my heart when I lolled tiredly to one of the neatly arranged hairs\
  \ in the shady library environment located in the outskirts of the noisy Lagos city.\
  \ Tomorrow is the D-Day: I said to myself. Thinking of the Promising Poets Award\
  \ competition that I had traveled 6hrs plus to Lagos for. You\u2019re talented,\
  \ but the country\u2019s writing competitions cannot help you. You could always\
  \ merit the awards, but as a commoner they\u2019d rob you of it. The words of my\
  \ teacher echoed in my heart and my hope gradually creased, Though,I was still primed\
  \ to be the turnaround of the old stories everyone was used to. Hmm. I groaned,\
  \ feeling tipsy as the cool breeze from the hibiscus flower caressed my bald shaved\
  \ head. Shortly, like in trance, someone was saying hi to me,but I looked helplessly\
  \ gripped by sleep after a tiring long trip by bus. I snored awkwardly, even worse\
  \ than a lactating sow. Excuse me mister? A strange girl said. And pate me on the\
  \ shoulder. Oh, sorry dear. I snorted, as I jerked fully awake, feeling horrible\
  \ for my poor sleeping posture. Lia is my name, the daughter of Senator Ben. She\
  \ introduced herself. Sorry for disturbing your rest; um, I saw you at the audition\
  \ hall days ago, and I loved your great poetry performance. She said, looking so\
  \ elated, while I battled with inferiority complex.\nOh, thanks dear! It\u2019s\
  \ a joy to have you love my poor structured work. I replied with spark of glee that\
  \ faked the intimidation that crushed my composure at the sound of her father\u2019\
  s illustrious name. Oh damn! Do I even have in this competition with Sen. Ben involved?\n\
  I said in my mind. As the big vent comes up tomorrow there\u2019s only one favorite;\
  \ and that\u2019s you. Lia said, and left my presence. Her words renewed my hope,\
  \ then I began to see myself falling from fear to fortunes."
