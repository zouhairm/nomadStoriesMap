Text: "When I am standing still, I can manage to keep the elegant image that the sari\
  \ affords me. It is when I attempt to move that it all goes astray, and I find myself\
  \ wrestling with the sweeping, uncooperative expanses of silky material. The women\
  \ dressing me find it amusing. Momota, the cook, peers into the room and assures\
  \ me that practice makes perfect. \n\nOnce the sari is elaborately folded and pinned\
  \ around me, the bling phase commences. Bangles, too skinny for my hands, are forced\
  \ over my knuckles regardless. A jewelled necklace is placed around my neck, and\
  \ a dangling diamonded tikla draped down my forehead. I feel almost regal, allowing\
  \ myself a moment of shy pride, as the ladies coo 'shundor' (beautiful). \n\nAs\
  \ is tradition, the bride sits on a dais at the front of the room as each guest\
  \ in turn smears turmeric paste on her forehead, and feeds her a spoonful of cake.\
  \ I\u2019m nervous when I realise that I too must perform this ritual. My sari is\
  \ fitted too long for my short legs, so every step is an unladylike effort to hitch\
  \ the billowing lengths up just enough to proceed without falling in front of a\
  \ large audience. I realise, horrified, that there is also a video camera recording\
  \ my clumsy ascent to the dais.\n\nThe bride is the most beautiful woman in the\
  \ room, draped in shades of orange and yellow and adorned in strings of marigold\
  \ flowers. For much of the evening she looks determinedly sombre, as traditional\
  \ requires. And this is all that the lens of a camera will ever be shown. However,\
  \ there are rare moments of an inadvertent smile, a few fleeting seconds in which\
  \ the bride is more beautiful than ever, her face radiant.\n\nAs the evening continues\
  \ I am inevitably asked whether I am married. In Bangladeshi culture it is traditionally\
  \ unusual to be single at the age of 26. I can sense it in Momota\u2019s reaction,\
  \ one of instinctual shock combined with morbid curiosity. She is a sturdy lady\
  \ and stares at me unnervingly with eyes of scrutiny as she inquires about my marriage\
  \ status. \n\nThe fact that my ears are not pierced is of equal shock to Momota.\
  \ She finally seems to reach an internal resolution to the disturbing discoveries\
  \ of not only my marital status but my unpierced ears, declaring that when I do\
  \ marry a man, I must get my ears pierced and he will be very happy.\n\nWell, then.\
  \ So be it. If I ever marry, that I shall do. In respect of an old Bangladeshi cook,\
  \ worn face and tough exterior, with her penetrating eyes, but rock-solid character.\
  \ For Momota."
