Text: 'Everything started in April 18, 2016, I was tired of my monotony life, everything
  was the same over and over like a creepy/horror story. I took my luggage and took
  a flight from Colombia to United States, I supposed to be an Au Pair, of course,
  I love children, my English was good and that moment, that decision pushed me to
  the edge of something better, I worked for a family in San Francisco, they had triplets
  but they were not ready for being parents and I was doing everything with their
  kids, I was young (I am still young) but in that moment I felt like a little caterpillar
  that was becaming in an amazing butterfly, in effect, I flew, and I did so far,
  my second stage was North Carolina with a perfect family that had twins, they were
  fantastic, I had the opportunity of study en some institutes, of travel around United
  States, Miami, New York, Long Island, Manhattan, Chicago, every place was magic,
  they were charged of energy, and then I realized how much I loved my new lifestyle,
  how much I was needing this, how happy I feel being like a butterfly, watching my
  wings moving around the world and now I know that my place is the air and my dreams
  are some that I wanna save for ever in my words.


  How I became in a writer?


  I started at my 14 years old, I took some creative writing courses (one in Spain
  and another in United Stated) I published a book called "11 historias para no dormir"
  In google play book, and now I''m going for more, being a best seller is other of
  my dreams and I believe enough in me for know that will happens soon'
