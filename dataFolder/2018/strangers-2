Text: "The gravel track wound its way up the wooded flanks of the mountains. The landscape\
  \ lay motionless, disturbed only by the dust whirling up behind us. We hadn\u2019\
  t seen any signs of civilization since our lunch break at a long-abandoned farm\
  \ in the valley below.\nAs dusk bathed the mountains in shades of violet, we began\
  \ to worry if we had taken a wrong turn. According to our map, we should have passed\
  \ through the small village of Ni\xE7\xEB by now. But there were no signs of a settlement\
  \ except for a few wooden fences alongside the way and the odd haystack shimmering\
  \ golden in the dying light.\nAs we rounded the next bend, an ancient building came\
  \ into view.\nEven though there was no evidence of modern amenities like electricity\
  \ or running water, the place looked inhabited. There was white linen hanging from\
  \ a clothesline, softly flapping in the gentle breeze and a disintegrating truck\
  \ obstructing our way.\nTwo girls, not older than 12, stopped in their game of catch\
  \ to stare at our SUVs which must have appeared futuristic in this place where time\
  \ seemed to stand still. As we still didn\u2019t know where we were, I armed myself\
  \ with a map to ask them for the way. I flashed my warmest smile at them and greeted\
  \ them shyly: \u201CMir\xEBdita!\u201D. The girls started giggling and fled through\
  \ a gap in the wall. Surprised, I followed them into a small yard.\n\u201CNi\xE7\
  \xEB?\u201D I asked with a helpful wave of my map just as a woman came out of the\
  \ house. She eyed me warily but as I smiled reassuringly she came closer, excitedly\
  \ shaking my hands, all the while talking to me in rapid Albanian.\n\u201CNi\xE7\
  \xEB?\u201D I tried again, earning more giggles. More children appeared, curious\
  \ but keeping their distance. Their laughter was contagious even though I had no\
  \ idea what was so funny. Then, as I was about to give up, an old woman came up\
  \ to us. Hopefully I asked once more. A broad grin crept onto her wrinkled face\
  \ as she spread her arms in a wide gesture, taking in the few scattered houses around\
  \ us, and exclaimed, \u201CNi\xE7\xEB!\u201D. Finally, I understood their amusement.\
  \ This was Ni\xE7\xEB.\nWhen the grandmother took my hand and crossed herself, I\
  \ knew that she was blessing me with a safe onward journey. There was no language\
  \ barrier when I conveyed my thanks to her with a beaming smile.\nThe whole family\
  \ stood waving us goodbye when we continued our way, some of the kids running after\
  \ us for a little while.\nAs we cautiously made our way down the bumpy path we wondered\
  \ how long they would remember those weird strangers asking for Ni\xE7\xEB."
