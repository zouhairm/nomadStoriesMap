Text: "Jim laughed wheezily as the cab filled with dust. My eyes were scratchy and\
  \ sore, and I tried to laugh with him. I asked Jim for the umpteenth time how far\
  \ it was to Bob\u2019s Yard.\n\n\u201CNot far now mate. Yeah, not far.\u201D\n\n\
  I came across Jim walking in the middle of the road near the beginning of the Buchanan\
  \ Highway, in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. A Gurindji elder, squat with\
  \ long white hair and a dusty felt hat, Jim was hoping to see one of his sisters\
  \ in Kununarra, about 650km away. Maybe she wouldn\u2019t be home, he said. Long\
  \ way to go for someone not to be in, I thought.\n\nDespite its highway status,\
  \ the Buchanan was 400km of corrugations, washouts, bulldust and stray cattle, snaking\
  \ through the vast northern eucalypt woodlands. The going was treacherous now the\
  \ sun was low, lighting up clouds of bright orange dust, the sun-strike reducing\
  \ our vision to a few meters. Jim said we should overnight with his relatives, at\
  \ Bob\u2019s Yard. Not far.\n\n\u201CNew place, all mod cons,\u201D he said. \u201C\
  Government place. For us.\u201D A man of few words.\n\nHours later, on the eastern\
  \ boundary of the Judbarra National Park, a rusty oil drum appeared in the headlights.\
  \ Here, said Jim. By now I had accepted that \u201Cnot far\u201D was an elastic\
  \ term, not easily quantified. I was dog tired and relieved to have dodged all the\
  \ cattle and kangaroos. My trusty old Toyota 4WD rattled and swayed over the overgrown\
  \ track into Bob\u2019s Yard. I don\u2019t know what I expected really.\n\nThe first\
  \ thing we saw was a large satellite dish and a solar array. Three large buildings,\
  \ sheds, a workshop. As we turned to park, the headlights picked out several cars\
  \ in the scrub, abandoned, missing doors and wheels. The grass was very long. Jim\
  \ squirmed in his seat, silent.\n\nWe walked to the buildings. They were utterly\
  \ destroyed, doors smashed in, holes in all the walls. There was an overpowering\
  \ smell of stale booze and rodents, broken bottles strewn throughout. A water tank\
  \ stood on its side, crushed against a tree. A bright red generator lying in the\
  \ dry, overgrown grass. The hi-tech solar control room, all switchboards and battery\
  \ banks, was full of cobwebs, but strangely undamaged. The dish gazed forlornly\
  \ up at the infinity of stars, buzzing faintly. There wasn\u2019t a soul in sight.\
  \ This place must have cost a fortune, I thought. \n\nI found Jim sitting behind\
  \ the dish. As he looked up at me, a tear rolled down his dusty cheek.\n\n\u201C\
  No good,\u201D he said. \u201CNo good.\u201D He turned away. \n\nMy heart broke.\
  \ This wasn\u2019t what I expected at all."
