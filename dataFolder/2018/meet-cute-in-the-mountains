Text: A blanket of fog cloaked the great Himalayan range.... in the cold breezy morning,
  I was bundled up against my bed in a small tent. Finding it very difficult to open
  my eyes in weather of the Ghangrai in Uttarakhand, India. With great difficulty
  I woke up and started to freshen up as we had to continue our trek in the Himalayas.
  I was on my way to see the rarest flowers of the Himalaya blossom in the Valley
  of flowers of Uttarakhand. While we were in the middle of our trek we saw a tea
  stall and decided to take a break as our journey was 7 hours long. The tea stall
  was paltry but nice and cozy. While I was sipping my cup of warm soothing tea in
  the cold weather I was startled by this magnificent creature which. Started licking
  my shoes. I had never seen a Tibetan Mastiff puppy before. They are huge yet so
  gentle. I fed him some wafers while this boy in his teens, who was serving us tea,
  introduced us to the puppy whose name was Browny. The puppy was brown in colour
  and had a tiny mane. The boy, whose name is Chhotu, offered to guide us to the Valley
  of flowers. He told us about the tea stall which was owned by his family from generations.
  We were also informed about the poor conditions in which the villagers live, where
  one of the occupations followed by to villagers was to carry a passerby while trekking.
  In spite of living in poverty, Chhotu had a smile on his face and a sense of security.
  This sight is infrequent in huge crowded cities such as Bangalore. After finishing
  our break, we continued our trek with the guidance of Chhotu.
