Text: "\"One breath at a time.\" \"One breath at a time,\" I repeated. The exposed\
  \ strip of skin beneath my sunglasses and above my scarf burning in the acidic,\
  \ sub zero Himalayan winds. \"One breath, my foot skidded on a pane of ice, shielding\
  \ the rocky path beneath it, at a time\", The internal mantra, which 12 months and\
  \ 28 days earlier I\u2019d been using under very different circumstances. \n\nThen,\
  \ those words were supporting me, full of pain and fear out of a difficult seven\
  \ year marriage. Now, just 386 days later these same words were carrying me, exhausted\
  \ but jubilant, strong but humble to the moonscape of my childhood dreams, Everest\
  \ Base Camp, Nepal.\n\nIt had been eight days since my guide Prem and I had hurtled\
  \ into Lukla airport, a mere ribbon of concrete enveloped dramatically by the world\u2019\
  s highest, most arresting peaks, at an altitude of 2800m. The freshness of the air\
  \ had excited my skin which had grown used to the dust and humidity of Kathmandu\
  \ in the days prior. It had been six days since I had been able to wash, under an\
  \ arctic shower in the spirited, panoramic Sherpa town of Namche Bazaar. A popular\
  \ acclimatization spot with eager hikers. Where the air became slighter and breaths\
  \ more calculated, at an altitude of 3440m. And it had been 3 days since I\u2019\
  d had access to running water outside the warmth of the comforting, wooden Tea House\
  \ kitchens. All other sources had succumb to December\u2019s glacial charm. Sinks\
  \ had formed pyramids of ice under their tap heads, built drip by frosty drip, as\
  \ we had ascended upwards from the bleak hamlet of Dingboche, at an altitude of\
  \ 4360m. Here the air had become unable to ease the onset of heavy, thudding, altitude\
  \ headaches and currents of nausea. \n\nNow, three hours after my last ginger tea,\
  \ (a Himalayan staple) past the barren landscape of Gorak Shep, the awe filling\
  \ Khumbu ice fall to my right, I scrambled, adrenaline flowing the last hundred\
  \ meters of my crusade.\n\nAnd there, at 5364m, in the strength of world\u2019s\
  \ highest mountain, Sagarmatha, Chomolungma, Everest, call her what you will, in\
  \ a vastness of austere rock and ice, the unexpected happened. Battered by minus\
  \ 17 degree winds, as I removed my gloves to reach out and feel the frozen pile\
  \ of vividly dressed stones, proudly labelled \u2018Everest Base Camp 2017\u2019\
  , my heart began to thaw. Suddenly, I wanted to share this moment with 'him', whoever\
  \ he was and whenever I would meet him. The mountains had healed my fears with a\
  \ bravery and I felt ready to fall in love again."
