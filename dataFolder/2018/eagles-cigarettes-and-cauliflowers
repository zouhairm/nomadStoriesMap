Text: "I began staring at the cloud of smoke that, along with the alcoholic content\
  \ of the raki, was making the colorful contours of the room blurrier and blurrier.\
  \ There were mirrors and mosaics all around me, as well as old paintings hanging\
  \ randomly on the walls. Old Balkan style. I was actually thrilled we could have\
  \ a cigarette inside a restaurant, without having to leave the table full of bread\
  \ and garlic mayo: in Italy all that had long been forbidden; it wasn\u2019t in\
  \ Albania.\nI had already noticed this detail during the journey from Southern Italy\
  \ to Durres, before arriving at Tirana. On the ship I had seen a bunch of people\
  \ who had no money for a seating position, so that they were sitting in a circle\
  \ on the floor. I remember them smoking quietly in an overcrowded corridor without\
  \ windows, but nobody seemed annoyed by that. The smoke was simply swallowed by\
  \ the \u201890s sober, angular, dark d\xE9cor around them. Some old women had their\
  \ head covered with a simple scarf, tied with a knot under the chin. For twenty\
  \ years Albania had been the only country in the world that was atheist by Constitution,\
  \ and yet religious traditions survived, resurfacing after Communism: today Muslims\
  \ and Christians coexist peacefully in the so-called land of eagles. \nIt only took\
  \ one word to interrupt my flow: \u2018CAULIFLOWER\u2019. He said it in Italian,\
  \ CAVOLFIORE. How the hell did he know that word? Aldi, the young Albanian man we\
  \ met in the afternoon and invited for dinner, was speaking about food with the\
  \ rest of the group. \u2018How can you speak Italian so well?\u2019 I interrupted\
  \ him. He glanced over my head, dispersing his thoughts in the smoke. \u2018I guess\
  \ thanks to the TV programs I saw in childhood..\u2019.He had never studied Italian,\
  \ but he was able to speak it with no interruption for an hour. Like most Albanians.\
  \ \nWhile fiddling with the breadcrumbs on the table, he explained how Italian Television\
  \ had represented their only window on the world up until 1990, when one of the\
  \ most isolationist Communist regimes in history collapsed. People secretly intercepted\
  \ Italian TV signals, falling in love with the lies about Western life commercials\
  \ were spreading: anything was better than that dictatorship. And so, in the early\
  \ 90s, their exodus to my country started.\nThat night I said goodbye to Aldi with\
  \ a full stomach, smoky hair and a strange feeling spreading through my body. Who\
  \ knows if Albanians were disappointed once they arrived in their promised land\u2026\
  Dare to dream, they say: the rest is life."
