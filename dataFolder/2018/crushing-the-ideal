Text: "Remember that feeling you get when you look at a picture of some famous sight,\
  \ such as the Eiffel Tower, the Chinese Wall, or the Statue of Liberty? You have\
  \ never seen these sights in person, but you have seen so many pictures that you\
  \ can somehow imagine what standing in front of them would be like. You can smell\
  \ the freshly baked Paris croissants and imagine posing for a kiss with your loved\
  \ one under the Eiffel Tower while the sun is gently touching your skin and the\
  \ birds are singing. \n\nThen, the moment comes one day and you find yourself there.\
  \ It is, of course, not entirely the way you imagined it would be, but you still\
  \ try to make it fit your expectations. You buy a croissant, take a romantic photo,\
  \ post it with the hashtag #CityOfLove, and show others the perfect expectation.\
  \ \nMy high school geography textbook had a fantastic picture of Lake Baikal. It\
  \ looked amazing \u2013 the water and the sky were of the most stunning shade of\
  \ blue you could ever imagine. We learnt that it was the deepest, oldest as well\
  \ as the largest freshwater lake by volume in the world.  It was by all means spectacular.\
  \ \n\nOn that September day, my train from Ulaanbaatar had stopped in Irkutsk. I\
  \ expected Siberia to be cold, but the snowflakes and wind surprised me. I hopped\
  \ on a marshrutka to Lake Baikal. The ride was bumpy, and it stopped after an hour\
  \ and a half, leaving us lost in the fog. I soon realized that we were just by the\
  \ lake and if the picture from the textbook were made of glass, it would in that\
  \ moment shatter into a million pieces. This may be the only day in my life that\
  \ I get to see this amazing lake, and I did on the greyest day possible. There wasn\u2019\
  t much to see. The lake and the sky were grey, you could not even see a few metres\
  \ ahead, and no mountains were in sight. I was freezing, so I sat in a nearby caf\xE9\
  \ and ordered some bliny, pancakes, while I waited for the next marshrutka. The\
  \ pancakes were amazing and as they slowly warmed me up, my initial disappointment\
  \ had vanished.\n\nTrue, I may not have seen the Lake Baikal on its best day, but\
  \ I experienced what a picture could not bring. I got to take photos and, although\
  \ grey, they are mine. They will never be printed in a textbook, but the lesson\
  \ I learned from that day would remain in my heart. I did not get my perfectly scripted\
  \ experience to merely check off my list, but my unexpected adventure was worth\
  \ much more. Since then, I no longer search for ideals."
