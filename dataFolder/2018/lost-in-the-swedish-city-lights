Text: "\"Hej Hej\" A man says to me through the loud Swedish conversations that have\
  \ accumulated in this Stockholm bar. He is noticeably a business man, clean shaved,\
  \ and attire as if he\u2019d just came out of an important meeting. \n He tells\
  \ me his name is \"Joakim\" as I confess my lack of ability to speak or understand\
  \ the Swedish language. I explain to him why I\u2019m in Sweden, my idea to collect\
  \ a tattoo from every country I explore, and my passion for culture as we quickly\
  \ get lost in deep conversation. \nUnaware of the mess I would find myself in shortly\
  \ after I leave my newly met friend, I proceed down the metro escalators only to\
  \ get stopped by two stern security guards whom knew just enough English to tell\
  \ me that the last train had departed. \n\nThe guards told me where to find the\
  \ night bus, however it never came. And now I find myself stuck in a unfamiliar\
  \ country at 2 in the morning, miles from my airbnb with no phone service or WiFi.\n\
  Standing by a bus stop wondering how I was going to get back to my airbnb a man\
  \ comes up to me trying to ask me something, only he spoke no English nor French\
  \ (My only language to fall back on). Realizing that we share no mutual language\
  \ he uses a translator on his smart phone to ask me if I need a ride. I desperately\
  \ and thankfully accept his offer.\nWe begin this insoluble car ride as if we were\
  \ never strangers at all.\n\nOffering me a Red Bull as he pulls one from his glove\
  \ box, I take the chance and grab the complementary drink. The sound of a can cracking\
  \ and a distinct smell of carbonation lingering marks the beginning of our drive.\n\
  Before this situation, no one could have convinced me that I\u2019d become friends\
  \ so effortlessly with a Turkish man who spoke specifically Russian and Swedish\
  \ as we conversed with one another about how he came to live in Sweden, and his\
  \ ability to make money to send to his poverty stricken family back in Turkey, communicating\
  \ solely through a smart phone translator app. Transforming my tipsy French to Russian\
  \ and vice versa.\n\nLeaving his car, finally, in walking distance of my airbnb,\
  \ I say to my new friend a phrase I had learned at the bar. \_\"Tack s\xE5 mycket\
  \ min v\xE4n!\" (Thank you very much, my friend) I tell him this as I shake his\
  \ hand and we pull in for a goodbye hug as if we had become best friends.\n\nNow\
  \ walking through the luminous snow brightened by street lights, thinking back on\
  \ my night and the memories to come. I find myself remembering exactly why I love\
  \ to travel and explore so much."
