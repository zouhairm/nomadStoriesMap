Text: "Eighty Ringgit for dinner. This was a hefty price for a meal in Kuala Lumpur\
  \ and yet this ad at the corner of a hastily handed out promotional red brochure\
  \ caught my eye. This dinner hosted by the Picha Project, a socially-purposed catering\
  \ company that tonight was having a Palestinean refugee family make a meal at a\
  \ pop-up restaurant that would be followed by a fireside chat after dinner. It was\
  \ as if this ad was meant for me.\n\nIt was about over thirty years ago that my\
  \ mom arrived on the shores of Malaysia as a Vietnamese boat person where she lived\
  \ on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur as a refugee, an experience she does not talk\
  \ about a lot. I thought I can find some semblance of answers here and so it was\
  \ without hesitation that I paid and followed a group of twenty other eager diners\
  \ to the second floor of a caf\xE9 located right in the old downtown core of Kuala\
  \ Lumpur. The place was a self-professed hipster joint complete with an amusing\
  \ artwork that injected some levity in what I thought would be an intense evening.\n\
  \nDinner was served immediately in a buffet style, with Dalia, the Palestinean refugee\
  \ hostess. There were mini-shwarma wraps. Tabbouleh that smelled as if you were\
  \ mowing a lawn of mint and parsley. There was also djah mahshi - a roasted chicken\
  \ stuffed with rice that Dalia carved with ferocious precision. Finally, there was\
  \ Maqluba, which translates into \"upside-down,\" which accurately describes the\
  \ dish as it is a pot of rice with grilled vegetables that has been flipped over\
  \ onto a serving platter. As she laid out the food, Dalia made a picture-taking\
  \ gesture with her hand and said in a quiet voice, \"Instagram.\" Of course, the\
  \ diners let out a hearty laugh and pulled out their phones to comply. \n\nIt was\
  \ at this point we settled and ate. Dalia went around the room and came by my table.\
  \ \"Any favorite foods since moving to Malaysia?\" I asked. After a short pause,\
  \ she replied \"nasi lemak,\" citing the national dish of Malaysia. \"But I like\
  \ my maqluba a lot more,\" she said with a barely suppressed giggle. \"How's it\
  \ like living here as a refugee?\" She paused again as if struggling to find the\
  \ words. \"I like it here but it's not home. Malaysians are very nice but I can't\
  \ work. My husband...engineer. He can't work.\"  \"Do you want to go back home?\"\
  \ I asked. \"Not now,\" she said and afterward, she moved onto the other tables.\
  \ I was left with \"not now,\" the same answer my mom gave me everytime I asked\
  \ that exact question to her."
