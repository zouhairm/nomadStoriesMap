  \u2019 my five year old daughter exclaimed as we sat around the dinner table in\
  \ the simple surroundings of our Host, Ismail and his wife Sulin, in Kota Belud,\
  \ Malaysian Borneo. \n\nHer retell of the Australian Picture book (it\u2019s a long\
  \ one) was well received given that their english was minimal. Our host\u2019s bemusement\
  \ overridden by the joy of having two cute blond aussie kids in their home. Moments\
  \ like these become deeply etched in my memory bank and reinforce a love for travel\
  \ and discovery.\n\nOur intrepid family of four; my husband, our two children, Summer\
  \ (9) and Jasmine (5) and I were backpacking through Malaysian Borneo.\n\nOur three\
  \ day homestay with Ismail and his family was the highlight. Admittedly, the Orangutans\
  \ in Sepilok were up there with Zip lining between the islands in Tunku Abdul Park,\
  \ however, a homestay detracts from feeling like a tourist on a well trodden path.\
  \ \n\nAfter a night in our basic accommodation, we ate a breakfast of fried bananas\
  \ on the terrace overlooking the breathtaking 4000m high Mount Kinabalu, the highest\
  \ mountain in Malaysia. \n\nOver the next few days, Ismail showed us the sights.\
  \ Each day felt like a magical mystery tour. We visited a local village famous for\
  \ Parangs- hand made long blades and my kids got stuck in, firing the burner powered\
  \ by poles in cylinders pumped up and down to create heat. The Parang maker (who\
  \ we were told was 85 and didn't look a day over 70) then pounded the hot iron to\
  \ shape it. It is then fitted with a handle of wood and covered with an elaborately\
  \ decorated sheath. Our children played, laughed and chased the chickens with the\
  \ village children before we rode on a traditionally dressed Baju horse. The evening\
  \ was a treat as we cruised down the river and witnessed fire flies dancing in the\
  \ trees along the waters edge. \n\nThe best day by far was the final one of our\
  \ homestay. Swimming and zip lining along the blue river thick with fish and meeting\
  \ a party of local people who invited us to eat beautiful Malay dishes with them.\
  \ Language is no barrier when you can smile, laugh and swim with the locals and\
  \ the children all played like they had known each other for years. The day was\
  \ topped off with some karaoke Sabah style and we were dragged onto a makeshift\
  \ dance floor to the amusement of all. We left feeling sure that we had touched\
  \ their hearts as much as they had touched ours."
