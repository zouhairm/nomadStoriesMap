Text: "12noon and the Azorean heat had begun to really pound at my shoulders, echoing\
  \ the twinge of yesterday\u2019s blisters from my weary feet. I checked the route\
  \ description again and considered my options. I was looking for a road heading\
  \ South, between Pico da Mariana and Pico da Cova, but this is unhelpful on an island\
  \ like Sao Miguel, characterised as it is by innumerable conical undulations, the\
  \ result of the archipelago\u2019s volcanic past and present. I could perhaps be\
  \ forgiven for not identifying Mariana and Cova amongst virtually identical quintuplets.\n\
  \nIt\u2019s not just the many small peaks that are ubiquitous on this chain of small\
  \ islands situated slap bang in the middle of nowhere. The most insignificant of\
  \ walks quickly reveals a landscape thriving in the mid-Atlantic climate of heat,\
  \ wind and moisture. After several days of exploring the island on foot I had seen\
  \ acres of blue hydrangeas. These are not the polite garden variety, but giants\
  \ that tower over roads and paths, so vivid they become almost neon after rainfall.\
  \ In the midday sun, however, their lush green canopy afforded me precisely zero\
  \ shade.\n\nStuffing my guide back in my backpack I committed to the road ahead,\
  \ dismayed as the landscape turned into farmland. Around a new bend I helloed five\
  \ Azorean labourers who paused their lunch to listen patiently to my garbled explanation\
  \ of my lost path. Shaking their heads they gestured to the left and the right.\
  \ One took an elbow and oriented me towards the nearest hill up the partially constructed\
  \ road they were working on. \n\nGrateful for the universal language of a pointed\
  \ finger and stumbling on towards the peak I reflected that my present trajectory\
  \ bore no resemblance to the described route. But here comes the moral of the story.\
  \ As the farm track ended I found myself in a flat, unremarkable open field that\
  \ was, it turned out, about a mile out of the way of my original route. This field\
  \ is not on any tourist map, it has no stars on any review site, but stretching\
  \ out before me in a glorious technicolour panorama at the end of my wrong-turn\
  \ was the island of San Miguel in one view, framed North and South by the vast Atlantic.\
  \ \n\nRetracing my steps and recovering my path I completed my original route, through\
  \ mysterious tunnels, past an ancient aquaduct and back to my base in Lagoa. Resting\
  \ my burnt shoulders and rubbed feet in a local caf\xE9 that evening I reflected\
  \ that the detour for the best view of the day more than earned my crispy pastel\
  \ de nata."
