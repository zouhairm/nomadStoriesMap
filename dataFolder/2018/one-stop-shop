Text: "A combination of rain and sweat dripped off us as we pushed our hundred pound\
  \ bikes up the 45 degree driveway. We were heading to Paraiso De Los Rios, a hostel\
  \ located in the mountains east of Medellin. Except when we got to the top, there\
  \ was no hostel. The new owner seemed unmoved by our situation, but she recommended\
  \ a hotel just out of town that we could stay at. Ominous clouds loomed above us\
  \ as we made our way out of San Rafael. The slick steep roads made biking nearly\
  \ impossible so we continued on foot. As we neared our next destination, a frail\
  \ man wearing a baseball cap and worn, baggy clothes called out to us. His name\
  \ was Martin and when he heard our predicament, he offered up his friend\u2019s\
  \ \u2018casa de pollo\u2019 (the chicken coop) or, he told us excitedly, we could\
  \ sleep at his tienda. \n\nIn our hurry, we hadn\u2019t noticed the slanted structure\
  \ on the corner that Martin was referring to. A tin roof was propped up by bamboo\
  \ poles, and underneath a local sat drinking a Pilsen at a broken picnic table.\
  \ The contents of the shop were jammed into a mini cement building where an old\
  \ fridge was held closed with a tire and behind that a random assortment of junk\
  \ occupied every other inch. Eager to get out of the storm, we took Martin up on\
  \ his offer and rushed towards the shelter. Martin had an absurd amount of nervous\
  \ energy and as soon as we sat down he was buzzing around us making sure we were\
  \ comfortable. Although we\u2019d just ate, Martin decided that we were hungry so\
  \ he began fishing pots and pans out of his storage bin. From the childish writing\
  \ on the pots \u2018cookers to rent $10\u2019, we gathered this was one of his entrepreneurial\
  \ enterprises, along with selling sugar cane and firewood to tourists.\n\nOnce we\u2019\
  d chosen a pot, Martin went around the building and came back with a three-legged\
  \ metal fire pit: the stove. He stirred the leftover coals, gathered some wood,\
  \ and we all helped fan the fire back into existence with a rusted pot lid. Fortunately,\
  \ we'd picked up some arepa flour \u2013 a Colombian staple \u2013 and cooked the\
  \ small corn and water disks over the flames. A single lightbulb hung over the three\
  \ of us as we ate fresh arepas and communicated in broken English and Spanish. Exhaustion\
  \ from the day soon crept over us, so we unpacked our tent on a patch of dry dirt\
  \ floor and fell asleep. We didn't know what to expect when we agreed to stay with\
  \ this friendly stranger, but I don't think any hotel could've matched the kindness\
  \ and hospitality we received from Martin."
