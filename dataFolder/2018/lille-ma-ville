Text: "The first thing I saw getting off the train in Lille was a sign that said \u201C\
  sortie.\u201D What does that mean? \u201CWe\u2019re not in Kansas anymore!\u201D\
  \ Three military men riveting the crowd while clutching Famas gave me chills. Maybe\
  \ the chills were attributed to the 2 degrees celsius or maybe I just needed a toilet\
  \ which really posed a problem as I was not prepared with euro to pay for it's usage.\
  \ Great job, Amber! How am I going to find currency exchange when all the signs\
  \ are in French? I was alone in a foreign country, had zero knowledge of the language,\
  \ no cell service or cash, freezing, and had to pee. WHAT HAVE I DONE?! I sucked\
  \ it up and soon found myself relaxing a taxi!\n\nMy next visit to Lille was warmer\
  \ and I could discover more of Vieux Lille. The streets are a mixture of Flemish\
  \ and French design. It sits on the border of Belgium holding a mighty history and\
  \ european-grunge atmosphere. While adventuring the streets, I stumbled through\
  \ language differences with the locals. Mucho appreciated mis amigos! Wait that\u2019\
  s Spanish... I discovered Notting Hill while adventuring. This petit caf\xE9 is\
  \ made of tiny levels connected by an old wooden staircase spiraling to each level\u2019\
  s view of the streets below. Out the window, a \"thank you for visiting\" sign hangs\
  \ and French conversations are happening all around. It felt like being in a French\
  \ indie film, without the cool indie music because they didn't play any.. weird.\
  \ Certainly not like being in Kansas!\n\nBy summertime, I lived in Lille. Walking\
  \ around carrying baguettes with locals and visiting my weekend stop, a burrito\
  \ place where they use melted cheddar like the movie theater instead of the white\
  \ cheese. I saw French movies, took French lessons, and began saying bonjour and\
  \ merci. Lille also gave me the glorious le Croque McDo. Words cannot describe the\
  \ gooey greatness of this hot ham and cheese sandwich. Alas, Toto, I found my Kansas!\n\
  \nI fell for Lille because it was my first French encounter. Now, I've fallen for\
  \ it\u2019s charming esthetics. Each time I visit I am reminded of all the ways\
  \ in which my experiences have been enriching. From discovering that \u201Csortie\u201D\
  \ actually means \u201Cexit,\u201D to putting that taste of le Croque McDo in my\
  \ mouth, there\u2019s an emotional response triggering a memory from the visit before.\
  \ Being able to relive the experiences and feeling the evolution of learning a city's\
  \ unique culture, is a way to time travel into nostalgia which feels like home.\
  \ The memory that becomes us, becomes home."
