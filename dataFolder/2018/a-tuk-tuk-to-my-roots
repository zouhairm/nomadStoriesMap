Text: "The bus dropped me past midnight in what appeared to be a freshly ploughed\
  \ field. The road flanking it, desolate with a nocturnal stillness, was to lead\
  \ me to my hotel somewhere in this unknown land. At a distance, a street lamp flickered\
  \ hesitantly as if to reflect my own trepidation. A lone tuk tuk sat there awaiting\
  \ the last fare of the night, its driver slouched over his phone heaving sighs of\
  \ smoke that dissipated into a thin cloud above him. I found a strange comfort in\
  \ the surrealism of that setting and approached him. \nIn the morning I parted the\
  \ curtains of my room to find the once pastoral town of Battambang gradually morphing\
  \ into large blocks of concrete. I\u2019d have pondered about how modernity slowly\
  \ saps us of our simplicity and so on, but across the road was Nicky, my tuk tuk\
  \ driver from last night still engrossed in his phone, an hour before our appointed\
  \ rendezvous. \nA quick shower, a hurried breakfast and a short apology later, we\
  \ drove off to the outskirts of Battambang to slow down and imbibe a soon to be\
  \ forgotten way of life. Handmade rice paper, sun-dried bananas and the ruins of\
  \ an ancient Hindu temple remained the last of a once rich cultural heritage.\n\
  Back in town I indulged in a bowl of delectable \u2018kuy teav\u2019 before meandering\
  \ back through narrow lanes to my hotel. Suddenly the past and present juxtaposed.\
  \ A long forgotten melody drew me deeper into the maze towards an open window. In\
  \ that Proustean moment I found a family watching the Hindu epic Ramayana, the very\
  \ show I loved as a child in India, but dubbed in Khmer. Nostalgia bridged the familiar\
  \ with the strange as I remained in the shadows to fan these embers of the past\
  \ kept alive in these unknown alleyways.\nThe next morning as I greeted Nicky, still\
  \ stooped over his phone, curiosity prodded me to peek. \u201CHey, are you named\
  \ after Lord Sani Dev?\u201D he asked looking up.  Dumbstruck by his casual reference\
  \ to Indian mythology I jerked back and stammered, \u201CNo, Sonny is just my nickname\
  \ but how do you know about Sani?\u201D He gestured to me to stoop along; he was\
  \ watching an Indian series about Hanuman, the monkey god.\nI hopped into the tuk\
  \ tuk, reveling in the realisation that though modernity\u2019s slow creep yet heavy\
  \ tread was leaving its marks on this sleepy town, my own ancient culture still\
  \ throbbed in the simple hearts of people like Nicky, the tuk tuk driver. He wasn\u2019\
  t just my local guide in a foreign land of old ruins, but a companion in my rediscovery\
  \ of a familiar living culture."
