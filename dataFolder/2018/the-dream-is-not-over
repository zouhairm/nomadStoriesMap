Text: "Since I was 12yo, I've always heard about the American dream. And after years\
  \ of study and work, I was ready to make it come true. \n\"I'll give you tips you\
  \ need,\" friends who traveled to the US used to say. \"Thank you, but I want to\
  \ create my own journey!\" I replied. They wanted to travel with me, through the\
  \ experiences they had. \nAfter 9 hours flying, I was waiting for the American immigration.\
  \ My legs were shaking, my throat was dry, my heart was beating fast. Although I\
  \ had everything right, I always read stories of people returning home.\n\"How long\
  \ will you stay?\", \"Where are you staying?\" asked the agent. \"I'm here for tourism!\"\
  , \"I'm going to stay 30 days!\", \"I'll stay in these hostels!\", I would reply.\
  \ \"Welcome!\" He said while stamped my passport.\nI arrived in Miami around 3am.\
  \ I could not spend much money so I decided to sleep on the floor before heading\
  \ to my hostel. I was looking for a place when I saw several people sleeping. I\
  \ knew I was not alone. Traveling is also finding the world by our side.\nAfter\
  \ 5 days in Miami, it's time to return to the Airport. Now the destination would\
  \ be Washington D.C. My flight was 11am. Minutes before boarding, one of the biggest\
  \ nightmares began: I lost my passport.\nAlmost crying, I approached an airline\
  \ employee and reported what happened. \"You cannot board without an ID,\" she said.\
  \ \"How can I travel to my other destinations?\", \"Are they going to deport me?\"\
  \ Some questions terrified me.\nI said me to look for the police, because \"the\
  \ Brazilian passport was one of the most valuable and anyone can be a Brazilian\
  \ citizen.\" The security agents said that I could not travel to other cities and\
  \ that I should return to Brazil. \"What do I do with my trip to other cities?\"\
  , \"And the money I spent on hostels?\", I tried to explain with a basic English\
  \ level and with my hands.\nTwo very polite police officers said I did not have\
  \ to go back to Brazil. I could go to the Consulate and request a new document.\
  \ My bag was already in Washington D.C. while I spent another day in Miami until\
  \ get a new document.\nThe next day, with a new passport, I returned to continue\
  \ my journey. While purchasing a new ticket, they told me that my previous passport\
  \ was found and was at the Lost and Found office.\nStill not believing, I went there.\
  \ With mother's eyes waiting for the son after the night club, two employees were\
  \ waiting for me with a smile. \nThe American dream was not over. But I was carrying\
  \ some unexpected experiences forever."
