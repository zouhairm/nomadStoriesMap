Text: "\"Edathu chavitti valathu maari\". Confirmation came as some human shouting\
  \ and sounds of rigorous battling of sticks. Search for the Kalaripayattu centre\
  \ near Lokanarkavu came to an end. Once upon a time this place was well known for\
  \ producing one of the finest, most skilled and extra ordinary kalari warriors.\
  \ Reason for my quest began as I heard the story of \"Othenan\", one of the legendary\
  \ heroes of Ballads of North Kerala. He knew traditional Kerala martial art called\
  \ Kalaripayattu, inside out. He defeated almost all the best warriors who lived\
  \ in Kerala during 16th century. \n\nLoud shouting got louder as I reached the entrance.\
  \ The Gurukkal, the main teacher, the serious one, was overseeing the morning training\
  \ session. The disciplined disciples, wearing the loin clothes in the 'traditional\
  \ warrior way' were focused on their steps and postures while using their wooden\
  \ and metal weapons. One wrong move, a fraction of second of carelessness meant\
  \ serious injury! They must be advanced practitioners, I thought.\n\nThe Gurukkal\
  \ looked at me quizzically and came closer to me. Not many travelers might be visiting\
  \ there, that early in the morning! Realizing the reason for my visit, he asked\
  \ me to join the training session and promised to share the stories that he knew\
  \ later after the session. I gladly agreed and focused my camera towards the sparks\
  \ that came off from the real battling swords! \n\nI relived the moments as the\
  \ Gurukkal started telling me the story of Othenan. After seeing the training, I\
  \ knew that there was no exaggeration involved when he said Othenan could do three\
  \ front flips in air even without landing! But my surprise came when I heard about\
  \ Unniyarcha, one of the heroines of Kalari tradition. Her story of how she braved\
  \ through 'hooligan infested' area to disarm a bunch by brandishing just with a\
  \ wet towel was more than inspiring. People talk about women equality in 21st century\
  \ and the story I heard was from 16th century. There was something we all should\
  \ learn from Unniyarcha, I felt. Especially the so called conservative families\
  \ in Kerala who thinks their daughters should be protected by someone who is from\
  \ the \"stronger sex\". \n\nThere I was listening to the story of Unniyarcha who\
  \ went against the 'advice' of her husband and mother in law to cross a place notorious\
  \ for hooligans and saving the life of her husband single highhandedly from the\
  \ bad guys and defeating and teaching them a lesson! A true story of true liberation\
  \ of womanhood!"
