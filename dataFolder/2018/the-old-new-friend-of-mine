Text: "More than 20 years ago, a blind Bulgarian seeress Vanga predicted various events\
  \ that are still coming true. There is a list of her prophecies and no one knows\
  \ which of them are hers. Among them, however, there is one: in 5079, people will\
  \ find a boundary of the Universe. Who knows if people of unimaginably future future\
  \ will indeed face the edge of the world, but in 2016 I definitely did. My friend\
  \ and I, we decided to go on a vacation to Anapa, a small town located on the northern\
  \ coast of the Black See. Good old place. Is there anything I haven\u2019t seen\
  \ after several summers spent there? I bet you can predict the right answer. But\
  \ I couldn`t. It was our 6th day in Anapa, we passed abandoned cars that were missing\
  \ all wheels, a grape yard, old garages, garbage, unfortunately, and then I saw\
  \ a new construction and the sky. I came to the edge of the hill and when I looked\
  \ down I saw it. \u201CDo you see this?\u201D I cried to my friend. \u201CWhat?\u201D\
  \ \u201CThe earth is round! We reached the edge of the world! You can actually see\
  \ it here!\u201D We came to the edge of the mountain and looked down: white curious\
  \ waves of the Black See were spreading its foamy hands in attempts to climb to\
  \ the brink of the precipice of this tremendous vertical hill where we were standing\
  \ only to fall down and merge with the sea again. I remembered Shakespeare`s lines.\
  \ He described that unreasonable and unknown feeling when one wants to jump into\
  \ abyss. But it is too beautiful here. There are moments in life so modest, but\
  \ at the same time so flamboyant that no words are needed. I wish you were there,\
  \ too. Those moments, minutes, seconds when you not only know, but f e e l that\
  \ you are alive. We reached the top of the hill we were climbing. Who would have\
  \ thought this place has such a generous souvenir for me? I smile in return. Now\
  \ I recollect that moment in my life with the help of photographs we took that day.\
  \ I see myself standing hands wide in the air trying to mimic the vastness of reality\
  \ around me. It is painfully sharp and soothingly blurred at the same time. Sun\
  \ covers the earth, the rock slope, mountains, water underneath us, and multi-faced\
  \ stairs on which I stand. On our way back we encountered a woman who gave as a\
  \ twig with black grapes. She said she had washed it in the sea. Black grapes embraced\
  \ by sea salt. Who would have thought? In the end, it was worth it. All my life\
  \ was worth this day. I`m nothing compared to the nature and its grandeur, but I`m\
  \ happy. And it is enough for me now."
