Text: When I arrived in Downtown Los Angeles, I directly felt more comfortable as
  on Hollywood Blvd.It was more realistic and honest.I walked for a few blocks, took
  a street left and suddenly a biting smell crawled into my nose.I was on Skid Row.
  A street full of homeless people living in tents.A total contrast program to Hollywood
  Hills.How was this possible?Just a few miles away from the rich and famous?The Walk
  of Fame, suddenly felt like a walk of shame.All I was hoping to find on my trip,
  was some time to get back on my feed and remember my dreams before they've included
  a man in it.But once again, my surrounding affected me too much to do so.I stepped
  into the next bus and left.After 2 hours drive,I arrived in Malibu. After a while
  I found some stairs between two majestic mansions.It looked like a private way,
  but there was no human being in a 2 mile radius,so I took the chance and suddenly
  found myself between a splendor of backyards reaching into the Ocean.Now I really
  realised how beautiful and luxurious those properties were, and especially how empty.I
  kept on walking, till I was standing infront of a rockface.I carefully jumped from
  one stone to another,continued climbing and found myself on the other side,in the
  middle of an incredible beautiful bay.I closed my eyes and breathed slowly in and
  out.The whole place was screaming my name.The moment I sat down,everything fell
  off my shoulders.The circumstances I found myself in and everything I left behind
  at home.While I was thinking about my life, a veil fell off my eyes and I started
  crying.But for the first time in months,those tears didn't taste salty anymore.They
  tasted sweet, cause I realised, that I've put all my love and energy into relationships
  and totally forgot about myself for the last years.I was caught up in the city jungle
  back home, I didn't fell comfortable in my surroundings anymore and I needed to
  change my life.I leaned back and saw a few seagulls flying trough the air.Somehow
  I admired them and wished to be one of them.Floating in the wind, enjoying this
  beautiful view, free of all those human needs and fears.And suddenly the thought
  of my empty home,wasn't frightening anymore.After I saw all these empty mansions,I
  even looked forward to build something new.With this thought I left the bay,which
  has given me more than I've ever expected.And I know by now, that one day I will
  also live in my lovely house at the beach.Not as big and wealthy as in Malibu, but
  warm and full of love.
