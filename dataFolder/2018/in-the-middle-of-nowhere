Text: "Once upon a time, I was visiting a picturesque and bright place, which had\
  \ a territory that looked like a hat on the maps. In those days, winter was furious,\
  \ every road in the country was white. Snow was everywhere: on the roof of buildings,\
  \ on the benches in parks, even, playgrounds were completely filled with it. \n\
  My last destination was a small village in the woods. What I was doing there for\
  \ so long? I had no idea. One thing I knew that my intention was to hide in the\
  \ silence of the nature. \nThe view here was unbelievable, it was like standing\
  \ on the edge of the world and observing everything that was beneath you. The wind\
  \ was icy, but warm clothes gave a possibility not to notice it. I was listening\
  \ the whisper of nature that was around me. Some birds were flying and trying to\
  \ find some safe place to avoid possible blizzard. Trees were looking dangerous,\
  \ because every branch was starting to sway. Regardless of this unpredictable weather,\
  \ I enjoyed it. Whatever was happening, I felt an adrenaline and relaxation. Strange.\
  \ \nI decided to come down to a narrow, limited bridge that connected two different\
  \ sides of one unique village. The first one was practically in mountains, covered\
  \ in snow with reminiscent of the old times. On the other hand, the other one included\
  \ an enormous area of recreation facilities. Daily parties and permanent noise were\
  \ a routine here. I went to the restaurant that was situated at the highest hill\
  \ of that side of the village. The panorama here showed, at first, a secure and\
  \ filled tourist center and, then, a peak of mountains, which were marking a wild\
  \ life that was also in this small hamlet.\nThe wine was delicious, every sip that\
  \ I could take gave me a chance to make myself comfortable, moreover, to discover\
  \ some new horizons. I was thinking a lot about all places that I had been lately.\
  \ The favorite one was hidden in the woods, where humans were not constant visitors.\
  \ This place in winter reminded me a fairytale, where everything was covered in\
  \ snow, only squirrels were jumping and running, being not afraid to ask for some\
  \ nuts. This picture had stuck in my head, when I arrived home. \nThat night the\
  \ snowstorm captured us for three days, every road was blocked and there was no\
  \ way out to the big cities. We were waiting till the weather would change. I was\
  \ standing near the window with the glass of wine, looking at winter masterpieces\
  \ outside and thinking about the last thing I expected from myself, to stay in the\
  \ middle of nowhere."
