Text: "Sometimes you get what you actually did not want. That happened to me while\
  \ at University. But then again, you find yourself in the middle of dilemma; you\
  \ want to do something different that even make you feel alive but your bank account\
  \ is always refusing this idea. \nSo, one day I just woke up and decided that I\
  \ really wanted to travel around my country and off I was. Knowing that Guatemala\
  \ is just around the corner, and the other places I have been reading of; desserts\
  \ full of magic, mythical cities and even ghost towns...\nWith this variety of options\
  \ it's not easy to define your idyllic voyage. And that's the moment I realized\
  \ that if I wanted to visit as much places as possible I should start at some point.\
  \ The arrival city: Cancun. I know you might think that there is nothing special\
  \ about this city, but the magic is expanded around the State. I took a bus all\
  \ the way down and I arrived to Chetumal. I was nervous because there is the Mexican\
  \ border near and since you arrive you can feel like if something is happening,\
  \ because the air is tense but at the same time is telling you that you are far\
  \ away from home and magically instead of feeling overwhelmed you start to realize\
  \ if the beginning of your adventure.\nStill, at night I was scared.\nAnd didn't\
  \ help that around 21h the streets and the city itself was like shutdown. No people\
  \ walking, or drinking a beer, no, nothing. So I was thinking what the issue was\
  \ and I found out that having turquoise water beaches, exuberant jungles and beautiful\
  \ sunsets couldn't hide that this little city was located on the middle of nowhere\
  \ and next to an international border.\nI started to talk to the locals and they\
  \ were so friendly. So I couldn't understand after one week why I didn't feel relaxed.\
  \ Probably because I learnt that every single travel you embark on is different\
  \ and most of the time no what you expect. Even the hotel staff invited me to have\
  \ a typical meal and the exchange started: they asked me  about myself and why I\
  \ decided to travel to that city, and they offered to take me to a little town 30\
  \ minutes away so I could swim and enjoy the atmosphere outside the city. I accepted\
  \ and to be honest I was even scared but always having the travelling dream on my\
  \ mind. We arrived and explained everything I needed to know. This place was so\
  \ magical, nobody on the beach but me and the blue sky. I returned to my city and\
  \ I thought: well, I wasn't surrounded by other people but I was surrounded by me."
