Text: "After painstakingly collecting every necessary document, waiting for hours\
  \ in a U.S. embassy to get my visa, and packing what seemed like all of the Republic\
  \ of Georgia in my two bags, the day finally came: I was moving to New York City.\
  \  Little did I know that my 14-hour flight would turn into a nearly three-day-long\
  \ journey between states. This is the story of how I took New York by storm. And\
  \ this decision pushed me to the edge during my longest flight.Layover time between\
  \ my flights was only an hour..Standing in this line in Tbilisi took 40 minutes\
  \ longer than expected. Two women in front of me kept calming me down and telling\
  \ me they have been flying with Turkish Airlines for their whole life and that everything\
  \ would be okay, until they realized they were in the wrong line. I never found\
  \ out if they made it to their flight or not.  As soon as the plane landed, I grabbed\
  \ my backpack and hand luggage and commanded myself to forget about all the proper\
  \ etiquette my mom ever taught me. I didn\u2019t let any kid or pregnant woman go\
  \ before me, and pushed my way through to passport control, desperate to make my\
  \ next flight on time. I only had 40 minutes remaining until my next flight\u2019\
  s departure, and the line in front of me was divided into seven never-ending lines.\
  \ Before Landing captain announced that there was a huge snow storm at John F. Kennedy\
  \ Airport, and we would not be able to land there.I was left alone in different\
  \ state where we would land, in America by myself, a foreigner, for the first time,\
  \ unprepared for the dreadful weather, without a cell phone number or any outside\
  \ contacts, without even an American phone charger. Later I found out I lost my\
  \ luggage. Turkish Airlines finlally booked  a hotel in DC for a night. But my driver\
  \ was gone.I was about to start crying when I saw another driver who kindly offered\
  \ to take me to my hotel. I happily agreed and only after we started driving and\
  \ I saw the forest on the road, I realized, I\u2019m living out my worst nightmare.\
  \ In a stranger\u2019s car, in a foreign country, without any clue where to go\u2026\
  Luckily, this stranger was not a murderer, as in the movies. Next day I took the\
  \ bus to NYC. The decision I made months ago when I applied to King\u2019s and decided\
  \ to move across the world and live on my own tested my boundaries of strength and\
  \ sanity. But you can\u2019t learn and progress in life if you do not test your\
  \ limits. After this trip, I feel like there will be nothing that can ever stop\
  \ me."
