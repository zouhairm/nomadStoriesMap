Text: "Still four hours left until my plane departs and here I am, at the airport\
  \ ready to go home. Home sweet home. Shame, guilt and relief are competing with\
  \ one another for my full attention while I hop from shop to shop in a desperate\
  \ attempt to quiet my mind and to quiet the upcoming boredom. Arriving early at\
  \ the airport is not my thing, running to the gate after my name has been called\
  \ through the intercom, see \u2013 th\xE1t is my thing. But as you already know,\
  \ not here. Not this time.\n\nWhile I study a random purse and pretend that yes\
  \ m\u2019am, I can afford it, the images from the past few days flash before my\
  \ eyes. I see that old lady walking in the main street of the city, holding a dead\
  \ chicken by its neck. In a street filled with traffic, shops and beautiful monuments,\
  \ there she is, holding a bloody carcass. I see that grumpy owner of a small trattoria\
  \ that yells at me that I can find Wi-Fi at McDonald\u2019s, not here. Adding that\
  \ he also does not have ketchup to put on a pizza. Not that I asked. I did not even\
  \ order a pizza. And then there is that group of six to eight men, following me\
  \ around the city after sunset. Suddenly they are there. It starts with just two\
  \ guys, but before I realize, more and more of their friends join. With the growing\
  \ number, they grow bolder, they shout louder and they pick up their pace. The distance\
  \ between them and me is getting smaller. I am sure they are having a blast, seeing\
  \ how I am desperately trying to pretend I am not afraid, while panic is slowly\
  \ starting to paralyze me. \n\nBasta, enough. I want to go home. I must admit that\
  \ the last thing that I expected when I was packing my suitcase to go on this trip,\
  \ was that I will end up feeling home sick for the first time in my life at age\
  \ 31. I used to think that I was a tough chick, an open-minded nomad with a gift\
  \ to feel at home wherever I went. Someone not easily intimidated. But you win Palermo,\
  \ you win.\n\n\u201CThis is an announcement for passengers flying to Barcelona with\
  \ Alitalia. We are sorry to inform you that the flight has been cancelled\u201D"
