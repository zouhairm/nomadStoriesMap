Text: "Cliffs of Moher is what motivated me to go there. Watching one program about\
  \ travel, I realized that was something incredible and could hardly be seen anywhere\
  \ else. I was also fascinated by Irish music and dancing, it was very interesting\
  \ to visit a real Irish pub, see the flavor of the country. And after 4 years I\
  \ landed in Dublin where my great journey was started. It was very calm and peaceful\
  \ here, but at the same time the pupils widened because of the local views. You\
  \ know, sometimes everything happens quietly, which is even boring, but there is\
  \ a cycle of events after which you are exhausted not only physically, but emotionally.\
  \ There I experienced harmony with myself, which I so rarely manage to catch. The\
  \ socio-psychological climate was very warm: everyone smiled, greeted, people were\
  \ very sincere and polite. Once again, like a real traveler, I went with a map in\
  \ the suburbs. I stopped, tried to get my bearings, although I did not get lost.\
  \ A couple passed by, the woman asked: \"Are you lost?\".\nI was looking forward\
  \ to the trip to the Cliffs of Moher. And it was at that moment that I realized,\
  \ as never before, that not always everything happens as we want. My first attempt\
  \ to get into this incredible place failed, because the tour was canceled. It was\
  \ insulting to tears, because it really was my secret dream, which in travel I have\
  \ not had. But do not give up on it now at all. I went a second time from another\
  \ travel agency. Surprises came from where I did not expect. I have never seen such\
  \ a heavy frog before. That`s serious, I couldn`t see beyond my outstretched hand!\
  \ I could barely find pointers. However, everything was not so bad, because we took\
  \ an excursion by ferry. Walking in the misty cliffs, having eaten the local fish,\
  \ we plunged into the ferry. At last we began to see something, the Cliffs began\
  \ to be seen. I felt total pacification, despite such an impressive view among the\
  \ vast water expanses. Even in this fierce fog had its own, on the one hand, a dark\
  \ and mysterious atmosphere, on the other - adventure. Despite such a disgusting\
  \ weather, you are still amazed at the whole greatness of this place. By the way,\
  \ there are very many suicides on the Cliffs of Moher. There is even a legend that\
  \ the incredible number of seagulls living there is the result of reincarnation\
  \ of those who have committed suicide.\n The trip to the Cliffs of Moher was ambiguous.\
  \ I'm even glad, I have a strong argument to return to Ireland again."
