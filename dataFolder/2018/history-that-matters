Text: "The last thing I expected traveling to Hungary is the preservation of the city's\
  \ history. Yes, I knew that Hungary is famous for its architecture, picturesque\
  \ places, old buildings, castles. But what I saw in Budapest struck me: a combination\
  \ of modern architecture combined with historical, monuments, cozy old streets and\
  \ centuries-old churches.\nBudapest is a city of dreamers and realists. It inspires\
  \ a lot. A visit to the main historical monuments, that show the history of the\
  \ city, its creation, events of the past centuries that contributed to its appearance,\
  \ pushes thoughts about the past and the future at the same time. Visiting these\
  \ places, I wondered: how did they build such tall buildings in those centuries?\
  \ How did they manage to decorate them so beautifully? How did they fasten all these\
  \ statues and columns? In addition, I thought - with the current technologies, we\
  \ can also create a story that will be preserved for our descendants and after hundreds\
  \ of years will please them with their majesty and beauty, telling about the events\
  \ of the past days.\nMost of all it was amazing and, of course, I liked that both\
  \ native people and visitors (tourists) respect the city and its orders. It turns\
  \ out that the story is preserved by the forces of each person, which means that\
  \ it becomes a kind of beacon of morality and respect. In modern society this is\
  \ not enough, but I was very pleased to see such an attitude on a trip to Hungary.\
  \ I captured this in photographs, even if the reportage photo isn't my main genre\
  \ of photo shootings. Clean streets, nice people\u2026 All this against the background\
  \ of historical cultural monuments, combined with modern \xABgadgets\xBB. At such\
  \ a moment I realized that we are all creating a new history there, and the city\
  \ is the point of intersection of times and generations.\nIt was a wonderful trip.\
  \ It was a little pity to leave the city of history so soon - to my great regret\
  \ it\u2019s not appreciated in my hometown. We have few architectural monuments,\
  \ the entire historical center of the city is being reconstructed. There are new\
  \ buildings that do not carry any semantic load, there are new offices and beauty\
  \ salons, tattoo studios, pharmacies, dental clinics. Most of the will be closed\
  \ soon, new ones will be opened, the owner of one business will change another.\
  \ But there won\u2019t be a story that can be passed on to the descendants.I\u2019\
  d like the citizens to take an example from countries where culture and history\
  \ matter, and not go into oblivion."
