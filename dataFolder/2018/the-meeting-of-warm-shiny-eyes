Text: "21 November 2015 And Milan too, has something very special going on. A twinkle\
  \ in its eye if you can pause to know it. Another city that loves its inhabitants\
  \ whether they know it or not. Yesterday, I took my first tram. Another of the peculiar\
  \ satisfactions, albeit small, that one has when travelling is facing and mastering\
  \ a new public transport system. Well anyway, this tram; old, rickety, completely\
  \ wooden and polished inside, looks narrow on the outside but has a really quite\
  \ intriguingly spacious and expansive feeling on the inside, is, gloriously, set\
  \ up so that you must face or sit across from your fellow travellers, just like\
  \ the trains in Buenos Aires. Not row behind row of cold anonymity, but a sharing\
  \ - an opportunity to connect and make eye contact, however fleeting, if and when\
  \ you want. These small opportunities to exchange a smile on the train make all\
  \ the difference to a society. \n\nAnyway, little things, that explode with joy...\
  \ a young teenage girl with 100s of beaded braids jumps off this tram and has left\
  \ her phone on the seat. She runs across in front of the tram and is gone. A blonde\
  \ old lady, but quite old, who many years ago had a great deal of botox and lip\
  \ injections, spies the phone, jumps from her seating place opposite, grabs the\
  \ phone, waves it in the air and yells \"tel\xE9fono! tel\xE9fono!\" The tram comes\
  \ alive!! The driver, who had already started to take off again, stops the tram\
  \ immediately and the windows on either side of the tram are slammed open with loud\
  \ bangs and everyone yells out each side of the tram \"Tel\xE9fono!!! Tel\xE9fono!!!\"\
  \ The change in energy is outstanding, I LOVE it! My eyes water and my heart beats\
  \ with joy. Then we all spy the teenager on the opposite side of the road frantically\
  \ rummaging through her bag. She looks up to the cacophony of sound coming from\
  \ our tram and beams such a smile and races over to get her phone from the old lady's\
  \ hand. Job done. The windows slam shut again. And the tram moves on. Inside, for\
  \ us, and I feel a part of it, everyone congratulates themselves on a job well done\
  \ and proceeds to discuss just how easily it is to lose your phone like this \"\
  just slips out of your pocket without you even noticing! Nod, nod, si, si\". Not\
  \ that I can actually understand all the words but with the gestures and hurrumphs,\
  \ clicks and all, it's clear. All our shiny eyes meet each other in agreement, warmth\
  \ and connection. Little victories of kindness and teamwork bind us all and win\
  \ the day."
