Text: "Delhi, the 16 million human and traffic tumult, the amalgam of unusual street\
  \ smells, putrid stench, people with soul piercing stares, the smiles, the clutter,\
  \ crows, cows, toot toot, poverty, luxury, shock and awe. I'm well and truly lost.\n\
  My senses are awakened like a hive of bees on a sunny spring day. \n\nA pigeon sends\
  \ a generous piece of whitey greeney pooey gooey stuff on my shoulder. I smile,\
  \ and remember the saying ?\"one day you're the statue, another day you're the pigeon.\n\
  \nI'm queuing in front of the security baggage check in a metro station with several\
  \ dozen commuters breathing down my neck. Some of them are starting to get worried\
  \ that their luggage will go through too fast on the magnetic band and they might\
  \ loose it!  And so, the pushing and shoving begins! The first people standing in\
  \ the queue lose their balance and we fall through the scanner like dominoes! A\
  \ true Laurel and Hardy experience.\n\nThe rickshaw driver takes me to the \"Real\
  \ Tourism Bureau\". They invite me for chai and curry. I politely decline and ask\
  \ for instructions to a budget hotel. They're trying to send me on an organised\
  \ tour instead. The kind stranger in front of the office warns me of scammers and\
  \ offers to take me to another \"Real Tourism Bureau\". A few hours in I find several\
  \ more bureaus.\n\nAnother rickshaw driver with entrepreneurial skills:\n- Hi my\
  \ frend. Where are you from? Come, come, we go.\n- No thank you, I don't need a\
  \ ride.\n- You want something else frend? Hash, pollen?\n- No thanks.\n- Some massage\
  \ then. Sex massage? (he whispers)\nYou've got to give it to him. He's got some\
  \ serious business acumen...for a humble rickshaw driver.\n\nChildren sell me bracelets\
  \ at India Gate. I pose for selfies with many strangers. I meet Abishek and his\
  \ friend in a park and we chat, and then decide to go and eat chicken lollipops\
  \ and drink Kingfisher from a mug. Someone offers to clean the wax out of my ears.\
  \ I respectfully decline the offer.\n\nI walk the streets and see impressive moustaches,\
  \ yawning charred sweetcorn selling women, fly covered bodies, holy men sitting\
  \ on cushions in Gurudwara Bangla Sahib. I get a free food offering. I decide not\
  \ to eat it straight away and dive down from a well aimed betel spit projectile.\n\
  \nThe auto rickshaw driver sleeps next to a stray dog in front of my guest house\
  \ in front of the Tibetan colony waiting to take me to the station. I brush a small\
  \ ant colony off my bed.\n\nPani puri and chai at the station.\n\nTaj Mahal, here\
  \ I come!"
