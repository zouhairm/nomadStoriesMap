Text: "A travel agency. \"I guess we will just go through the brochure, understand\
  \ the offering and leave. Wonder, if it will work out? or will it be another fail\
  \ plan as Turkey. Oh God! please no attacks on the country we pick this time.\"\n\
  \nFor me travelling was not something which was influenced. It grew in me slowly\
  \ yet strongly, the very thought of exploring different places would leave me with\
  \ goose bumps. But right now, for me to kick start my dream to travel was very important.\n\
  \nThese were the thoughts running in my mind while I was waiting for her to arrive\
  \ at the agency. Her?\nAn unknown, unseen girl I was pursuing from past 1 month.\
  \ Kiran, her first name is all I knew.\n\nMy thoughts were interrupted with someone\
  \ calling my name. It was Kiran!\n\"Oh, she is older than I imagined. Well may be\
  \ good to have an adult. Oh no, I hope she doesn't treat me as a child.\"\n\nKiran\
  \ conversed with the travel agent and took all the initiative. It was my turn to\
  \ respond and let them know if I am ok visiting Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah.\n\n\
  \"Desert!! Oil country!! May be, why not?? It might be a good experience to meet\
  \ people from same community yet from an Islamic country.\"\n\n\"Sure.\" is what\
  \ I replied thinking maybe I can go home and think this through.\n\nBut Kiran started\
  \ the procedure of payment.\n\nI thought \"Oh! ok this is seems final then\". Unfortunately,\
  \ I was not carrying my cheque book, neither can I withdraw 90k in one day from\
  \ an ATM. Hearing my problem Kiran said that\u2019s fine, \"I will sign another\
  \ cheque for you and you can pay me later\" and was paying my amount.\n\nWhat??\
  \ Is it really happening, maybe I should wake up? Why would she do that for me,\
  \ I don\u2019t even know her. I mean she doesn't even know me. Oh my God! it\u2019\
  s done. I am travelling. I will visit another country. Oh, this is real. This is\
  \ the moment.\n\nAnd yes, this was something that I never expected from someone.\
  \ It was all I needed, The PUSH, The Trust.\n\nI am now determined to travel to\
  \ 4 different places each year.\n\nIf you are forest wanderer then Jim Corbett,\
  \ Kaziranga and Manas are worth a visit. For me, Jungle safari was no different\
  \ than meditation. The site of mighty Tiger, angry Rhinos and beautiful grasslands\
  \ was breath taking.\n\nIf you need to spend some time with yourself then Goa, Port\
  \ Blair and Havelock Island are the places to visit. Radhangar beach in Havelock\
  \ is Heaven on Earth. Goa is the favorite destination of every Indian.\n\nGet started!!\
  \ it is your moment Travel, explore, learn."
