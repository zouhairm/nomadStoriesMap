Text: "In January 1983, a baby girl arrives, full of potential, holding the cleanest\
  \ slate. Fast-forward 35 years and that same baby, now a grown woman, feels defeated\
  \ and struggles to delight in her duties as a bartender.\nThe cure for all of life\u2019\
  s ailments? A vacation, surely!\nCuba, it is. I\u2019ve heard good things about\
  \ Cuba. \nI arrive at the resort just after midnight. Straight to the room to unpack\
  \ where I\u2019m greeted by a bottle of Havana Club rum. Off to a grand start. I\u2019\
  ve made lists. So many lists. I\u2019ve never been so prepared for a job interview,\
  \ let alone a getaway.\nThe next day, I take a bus tour into Havana. My head leaning\
  \ against the window, I stare out onto the Cuban countryside. We pass by quiet fields\
  \ full of cattle and tiny homes with hand-washed clothing hung out to dry in the\
  \ wind. For a country filled with a history of struggle and revolution, it feels\
  \ peaceful. \nWe get to Havana, and a lovely couple from Winnipeg invites me to\
  \ sit with them on a street-side patio during our free time. She\u2019s a nurse.\
  \ I don\u2019t know what her boyfriend does. They ask what brings me to Cuba, and\
  \ I drop the fact that I\u2019m now 35 years old. He buys me a birthday beer. But\
  \ then the nurse casually mentions how easy it is to get hepatitis in this part\
  \ of the world and proceeds to give me real-life realities about how it\u2019s transmitted.\
  \ Hepatitis hadn't been on any of my lists. I hadn\u2019t had any immunizations,\
  \ so my mind goes haywire.\n I find it difficult to enjoy myself at the Vegas-style\
  \ Tropicana show that night, my mind buzzing with paranoia of disease partnered\
  \ with serious self-loathing and regret for not having taken the proper care to\
  \ get vaccinated. However, as the complimentary booze begins to warm my body, and\
  \ the feathered costumes of the dancers wave in the warm Cuban breeze, my fearful\
  \ concerns begin to float away. Now buzzing with dark rum instead of worry, I\u2019\
  m relaxed, and I never want to leave Havana.\n The nervous thoughts return unapologetically\
  \ the next day. I wasn\u2019t in Cuba anymore. Not in my head, at least. Anxiety\
  \ had scored some quick goals on me, assisted by alcohol, and Nurse Winnipeg. I\
  \ didn\u2019t anticipate bringing my anxiety with me; it just hitched along, a stowaway\
  \ in my brand-new suitcase. It managed to stick by my side for the remainder of\
  \ the trip, sometimes silent, other times a thunderous rage, but undoubtedly an\
  \ ever-present nuisance loitering in my mind. \nSo, were all of life\u2019s troubles\
  \ cured in Cuba? Not exactly. But the rum sure was good."
