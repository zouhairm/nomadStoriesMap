Text: "I grew up 3rd generation Italian. I'm removed enough from my heritage to feel\
  \ like I can't claim it without being a fraud - an uncouth Australian girl trying\
  \ to claim some culture. But close enough so that when as a child my friends heard\
  \ my grandfather is Italian the word wog came rolling of their tongues.\nI've always\
  \ felt a pull towards Italy. I want to unlock whatever place inside of me feels\
  \ like Italy will complete me. I've been in Tuscany for a week so far and haven't\
  \ had any success in using the language I've worked my whole life to master. I've\
  \ spent my time cavorting with foreigners, drinking wine, taking group selfies eating\
  \ gelato and ogling Michelangelo's David. \nWhile I'm having fun, I don't feel a\
  \ part of Italy. I feel disconnected from the language, the history and the people.\
  \ I'm an outsider. A spectator to a sport I'm quite good at. I'm scared of discovering\
  \ who I am in Italian. What if I say something so stupid that every Italian on earth\
  \ gets told not to associate with me? There's something about expressing yourself\
  \ in a second language that opens up a world of possibilities that is exhilarating\
  \ and terrifying.\nOne day it's sweltering hot and I need strong coffee and something\
  \ greasy to settle my stomach. I go for a walk alone, I need not to be surrounded\
  \ by tourists (though I am one). I smell pizza. Satisfaction in a finite moment\
  \ is only ever within arm's reach when I'm eating pizza. My body follows my nose\
  \ and I step into a bakery set on the corner of the street I'm staying on. The mustachioed\
  \ rotund man behind the counter flashes a crooked smile at me.\nThis is my moment.\
  \ \"Buongiorno. Un pezzo di questa per favore.\" I point out the delicious looking\
  \ slice.\nHe's cheerful and willing to chat, so we do.\n\"You're visiting, yes?\"\
  \ He asks in rumbly Italian. Too many Italian men talking at once and you've got\
  \ an earthquake risk on your hands. \"You're from Florence, yes?\"\nThere's another\
  \ man standing at the bar and he laughs warmly. \"She's a foreigner!\" He tells\
  \ the man.\nThe old man makes a sound of disapproval as if he can't quite believe\
  \ it. \nMy grin almost splits my face in two. Somehow, this elderly Italian is convinced\
  \ that I too, am Italian. The feeling that rises up in me is like coming home. I'm\
  \ eternally grateful to this kind old man for recognising a part of me I wasn't\
  \ even sure existed.\n\"I'm from Australia,\" I tell them. \"But I am Italian.\"\
  \ And for the first time, that sentence doesn't feel like I'm trying to be someone\
  \ I'm not."
