  \ was walking down the stairs of my parent\u2019s home. \u201CI\u2019ve got some\
  \ eye drops, I get dry eyes all the time.\u201D He assured me it was a familial\
  \ trait. With my one good eye, I squinted and saw the panic in my doctor\u2019s\
  \ eyes when he came back into the room. He sat down, took off his glasses, the wrinkles\
  \ in his face became intense. \u201CDon\u2019t panic\u201D he tried to reassure\
  \ me, \u201Cbut I need you to have an MRI as soon as possible. It looks like Optic\
  \ Neuritis. But do me a favor sweetheart; don't stress.\" Optic Neuritis is a sign\
  \ for Multiple Sclerosis, a condition where a person\u2019s immune system attacks\
  \ its own tissues. I spent my 29th birthday with a possible death sentence, but\
  \ also a revelation;\u201CI\u2019m going to Italy by myself for my next birthday.\u201D\
  \ I told my mother, really to see her reaction. Her eyebrows creased and her bulbous\
  \ nose rose up her face, she knew that there was no discussion to be had. \u201C\
  Well I will drive you to the airport; Geesh, you will be the death of me child.\u201D\
  My mother has told me her stories of travel since before I could remember. Her stories\
  \ led me to this point, the point where I needed to make my own stories. Almost\
  \ a year later, after intense research and a solid itinerary in my backpack; my\
  \ mother and little sister drove me 3 and half hours to the Dulles Airport. When\
  \ we approached the airport, the shadow of reality clouded my confidence, \u201C\
  Why did you let me do this?\u201D \u201CWhat was I thinking?\u201D \u201CWho travels\
  \ around the world alone?\u201D My anxiety had reached a peak; I was certain I was\
  \ going to have a panic attack at any moment. My mother took the exit to the maze\
  \ of intertwining roads of the airport. \u201CIt\u2019s a little late to turn back\
  \ now.\u201D She said, never taking her eyes off the road, concealing her own fear\
  \ of her baby going to a different country alone. She grabbed my hand and squeezed\
  \ a universal sign that everything is going to be ok. \n \u201CExcuse me\u201D I\
  \ asked him, taking off my headphones. \u201CAre you guys, sisters? You have the\
  \ same hairstyle and you look alike.\u201D He said heavily accented and pointed\
  \ behind me. \u201CAh, nice! Glad to know that I\u2019m not the only one who knows\
  \ natural hair is overrated. Way too much work for a vacation.\u201D We both laughed.\
  \ We chatted while we waited to board and realized our itineraries were pretty close.\
  \  Everything was going to be ok, I met someone who was just as crazy as I was to\
  \ travel alone."
