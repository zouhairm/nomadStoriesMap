Text: "You never really see the change happening within yourself, until you are confronted\
  \ with it. My life took a 180 degree turn back in December 2005, yet at the time,\
  \ I had no idea.\n\nWe were headed to Egypt, for a 7-day holiday, over Christmas,\
  \ with my mother\u2019s immediate family. Sure, I knew I was going up in an airplane\
  \ for the very first time, and I was going to celebrate Christmas away from everything\
  \ I knew Christmas to be in Denmark. I was 16 years old, Egypt was so different\
  \ from everything I knew, new experiences were all around me, and I took it all\
  \ in.\n\nNow, 12 years later, I still remember the smell of the camels, the taste\
  \ of the hibiscus tea we had with the Bedouins, and my dad\u2019s pure astonishment\
  \ when he realised the Clown fish was an actual species of fish, and not just something\
  \ a Disney cartoonist had dreamed up and made a movie about. Everything was so exciting,\
  \ and new it was impossible to get fully entangled in the experiences. \n\nA few\
  \ months after returning home, my parents decided to get a divorce. The very different\
  \ Christmas in Egypt, turned out to be the last Christmas with both of my parents,\
  \ and sadly, both of my Grandmothers also passed away within a year of each other\
  \ shortly after, forever changing the holiday season.\n\nThis holiday was so full\
  \ of first times that until I started this process, I never really related it to\
  \ the many lasts it also contained. A never-ending longing for adventures and new\
  \ experiences took hold of my life. As I am now slowly approaching 30, I have lived\
  \ and worked in 7 different countries, scattered across 3 continents and become\
  \ such a different person than I had imagined was possible back when I was 16. Going\
  \ on my first holiday requiring an airfare, I never expected the journey I was embarking\
  \ on would alter the direction of my life this drastically, but I am eternally grateful\
  \ it did.\n\nHumankind is everywhere on this planet, and while we do not always\
  \ treat it kindly, our planetary home still offers unimaginable beauty and adventure\
  \ for those who are brave enough to explore it. I am determined to always look for\
  \ the opportunities presented, not the limitations. People can find adventures in\
  \ even the most challenging surroundings, if they only dare explore them.\n\nIn\
  \ 2005, I took a journey to a new continent explored a life so different from my\
  \ own, and I have not ceased exploring since."
