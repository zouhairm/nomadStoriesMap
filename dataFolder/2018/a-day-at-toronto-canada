Text: "As everyone has their own notions of a foreign land, as a typical tourist,\
  \ I wanted to try out different cuisines and visit the tourist places and have a\
  \ look and feel of the city as much as I could.\nI left for the city at about 9\
  \ in the morning and it took 45 minutes from Mississauga to Toronto, which was Union\
  \ Station Bus terminal given the downtown traffic.I was confused as to how the bus\
  \ and ticket system worked but the people were nice to help me with that. When I\
  \ finally reached Toronto, I saw the place with different kinds of people, each\
  \ experiencing their own journeys and their expressions blurting out stories worth\
  \ listening. Walking down the lanes of Toronto reminded me of the Television shows\
  \ which glorify the American culture. The weather was amazing but I was all the\
  \ more confused because I couldn\u2019t find my way. Google maps weren\u2019t helping\
  \ me the way it should have and the street signs weren\u2019t as helpful for me\
  \ either.I was reluctant to even ask people around. Everyone seemed so focussed\
  \ into reaching to their workplaces that I just didn\u2019t wanna disturb their\
  \ pace.\nFinally, I reached CN Tower, met a few more tourists. We reached up to\
  \ 1000 miles high and I could hear the silence and saw how busy the city really\
  \ is. Reaching on to the heights of CN Tower made me calm.\nFinally, after spending\
  \ an hour and a half there, I thankfully had a friend who took me to an amazing\
  \ restaurant and we had delicious food. This is another overlooked problem of non-vegetarians\
  \ who don\u2019t have an appetite for sea food or anything other than Chicken or\
  \ Lamb. What is even worse is that the way things are cooked lack the flavours I\
  \ usually eat, making it seem like undercooked. We went to Jack Astor\u2019s which\
  \ had an amazing ambience and moreover the sandwich I ate was definitely amazing\
  \ and even if it looked undercooked, it didn\u2019t taste like one.\nNext in my\
  \ iternary was Ripley\u2019s Aquarium. It\u2019s an amazing place for those who\
  \ are into Marine Biology or just fascinated by the creatures of the ocean or perhaps,\
  \ kids who get excited at the drop of a dime. It\u2019s made really resourceful\
  \ and fun too. They even show you how they keep the fishes, i.e., behind the scenes,\
  \ and that\u2019s pretty impressive.\nWith exhuberating visual appearances, I made\
  \ it to the end. I was really tired. So, I finally went to the Harbourfront to relax.\
  \ It was really nice to sit by the water in an amazing weather.\nI came back home,\
  \ had some home cooked chicken and that marked the end of the day."
