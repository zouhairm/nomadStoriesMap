Text: "We hardly talked: we couldn\u2019t, as she knew only a little English and I\
  \ did not speak Sesotho. But we sat together, in a comfortable silence I\u2019ve\
  \ known only with the closest of friends. Without language, we understood each other\
  \ anyway. We tended to and fussed over her little sister, Matladi, who would flit\
  \ about us playing with the other preschool kids. I could sense her watchful eye\
  \ and her protectiveness for sister, perhaps recognizing that defining quality in\
  \ myself, also an older sibling.  She had a cough, deep in her lungs, that would\
  \ rack her entire body. I worried for her, and felt helpless. She shivered against\
  \ the cold mountain air, wearing barely enough, and yet I with so much back at home\
  \ had nothing to give her.\n\nIt was May, the beginning of winter in the Southern\
  \ Hemisphere, in a rural, mountainous village in South Africa, and I was living\
  \ and volunteering in a daycare center.\n\nI looked forward to our daily meetings\
  \ very much. She and the other teenagers would come to the center after school,\
  \ in the afternoon as the sun sank behind the sienna hills and yellow light washed\
  \ over the valley below. They\u2019d hang out in that easy way that high school\
  \ kids do the world over, chatting and laughing, tossing around a soccer ball. They\
  \ were amiable and funny and curious and fascinated by everything they saw. \n\n\
  My travel companions and I crossed the nearby border into Lesotho one day, getting\
  \ our U.S. passports stamped at the walk-up office, simply to go for a hike and\
  \ have a picnic lunch. It was so easy for me to traverse such a border, to be in\
  \ two or several countries in a single day by train or plane. Yet someone like her,\
  \ living her entire life a fifteen-minute walk from the border, had never left the\
  \ country. Barely a generation ago, her own parents would have been born into Apartheid.\
  \ The wounds inflicted were still deeply felt in places like this, where change\
  \ was slow to take root.\n\nI turned twenty while living in her village; she looked\
  \ twelve or thirteen, but was possibly older. She was slight, delicate and graceful,\
  \ with her hair cropped close to her head. The only physical thing that betrayed\
  \ her maturity was her eyes, piercing and expressive beyond her years. I recognized\
  \ in them a kindred spirit, a young woman who was quiet but sure, unwavering in\
  \ her commitment to those that mattered, intelligent but humble, quick to smile\
  \ or laugh, and to lend support; often silent but incredibly strong."
