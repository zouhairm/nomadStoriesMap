Text: "I spent the last 18 years listening to my parents tell me about the wonders\
  \ of Fiji. Their memories and photos of my 3 years of childhood in the tropics made\
  \ it almost possible to trick myself into thinking those memories were my own. I\
  \ had grown a love for a country and it\u2019s people that I had not visited or\
  \ met. A local connection that drew me across the world as soon as I left school.\
  \ \n\nBehind the expensive resorts and beach bars, away from the golden tourist\
  \ trails, the true Fiji encapsulated my heart. From arriving in nadi airport, like\
  \ I\u2019m sure many others do, I felt like I was being welcomed home. This was\
  \ a feeling that never left me as I spent the next 6 weeks living the village life\
  \ on the tiny Fijian island of Gau. \n\nBefore my return home, I had to make one\
  \ visit to meet a man named Jale. I was told he had been like a second father to\
  \ us. I eventually made contact with his daughter and on my last weekend in Fiji\
  \ I met up with her. In the boiling and bustling market of Lautoka, she collected\
  \ us off the bus with a huge white Fijian. We drove for another 20 minutes, whilst\
  \ she told me how she wanted to surprise my father with my arrival. I was unsure\
  \ of this, as I knew he was now an old man, and I did not know if he would remember\
  \ me. \n\nWe arrived at a small quiet house. A giant man walked out who had white\
  \ hair and eyes that showed nothing but kindness and love within. He took my hands\
  \ in his and we both cried. It was a connection that I have never felt before and\
  \ probably never will again. \u201CYour father he is my best friend. He will always\
  \ be my best friend\u201D. It had been 18 years since my family had been in Fiji,\
  \ and Jale still had pictures of on his shelves. \u201COne day you will all come\
  \ back and see me again, we will have one big big Lovo to celebrate\u201D. Although\
  \ the happiness radiated from our smiles, a sadness dwelled within me - longing\
  \ for my family to be here in this moment. \n\nWe sat on his front porch for hours\
  \ while he told me stories of our time in Fiji. I felt like I had known Jale my\
  \ whole life, a new connection with a very old friend. \n\nThis is the feeling that\
  \ you get when you meet any Fijian. Fiji will captivate you with its endless natural\
  \ wonders but the real beauty is found within the friendships of the Fijian people.\
  \ Undoubtedly the most beautiful people in the world."
