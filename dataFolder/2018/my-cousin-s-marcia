Text: "One of my memorable trips to Jamaica. I went over the summer around the early\
  \ 90s. When I usually go I would spend time with my mom side of the family. Her\
  \ family lives in St Ann. I would spend time at my grandmas house. I would go to\
  \ church with my family and maybe to the beach. This time I met my cousin Marcia.\
  \ That was the first time I got to travel without my parents. She took me to her\
  \ home, while I was there she had s family reunion on her dad side. I\u2019m from\
  \ her mom side, usually I was not allowed to where pant but she let me borrow her.\
  \ Her pants was too long since I was a child. I found a short that fit me well.\
  \ The reunion was at the beach. It was my first beach party event. I saw a bond\
  \ fire and I enjoyed the music. Since I got to wear shorts for the first time I\
  \ was happy. I felt confident because I met Marcia. That experience of going to\
  \ a beach party was something I didn\u2019t plan but was one of my best moments\
  \ in life. \nThank to my cousin Marcia."
