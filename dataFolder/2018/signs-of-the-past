Text: "The chock full motorcycle was moving up swiftly on the serpentine. Mountains\
  \ rose huge and dark in the distance, like proud shadows, silently observing the\
  \ travelers. They hid abandoned houses and dead villages of Nagorno-Karabakh: most\
  \ of locals left during the war started in the late 1980s, only foolhardy came back.\
  \ Now there are bricks which once were houses grow along roads and tanks stand on\
  \ pedestals \u2013 as a reminder that war hasn't gone anywhere.\n\nMotorcycle roughly\
  \ stopped in crushed stones. The rudder faltered and we wrecked, having stuck under\
  \ two hundred-kilo piece of iron. I tried to rise on my feet, but it was too painfully\
  \ bend a knee. The only people around except for us were slowly moving in a huge\
  \ truck far away. \n\nThen i saw a car. In a cloud of dust it stopped in front of\
  \ us. Middle-age man got out of the car and helped to lift a motorcycle. The shirt\
  \ on his chest was unbuttoned and it was easy to notice scar across the chest. We\
  \ smoked. Garik, that was his name, noticed my glance and told the story before\
  \ the cigarette was finished. He fought in that conflict for Karabakh between Armenia\
  \ and Azerbaijan. It left him no friends and a bullets in his body. \n\nGarik invited\
  \ us to his brother\u2019s house. I jumped on the back seat and we followed him.\
  \ \n\nSoon he parked near a small hut. There were at least ten barefooted children\
  \ playing in the courtyard along with calves, chickens and dogs. We took of the\
  \ helmets and saw all of them staring at us as if we were aliens. We, actually,\
  \ were aliens there, but there was BMW F800 GS instead of a ship. \n\nIt was stuffy\
  \ inside. A musty watermelon and bottle of vodka stood on a table. Grumpy bald man\
  \ sat there: one of his eyes was staring at an empty glass, another was focused\
  \ on the opposite corner of the room. There was a hundred years old lady sitting\
  \ on a coach, staring into the void. The flies crawled over her hands and face.\
  \ The flies were everywhere in that house. \n\nGarik picked up a glass. \u201CI\
  \ heard, Putin is coming to visit us? He is a real man. He would win any war\u201D\
  . Garik cheers for Putin. Garik doesn\u2019t know or doesn\u2019t want to remember\
  \ thousands of deaths in the East of Ukraine and annexation of the Crimea, people\
  \ jailed for participation in a protests or those who were killed for journalistic\
  \ investigations. This is the world Garik cheers for not even understanding it.\
  \ We cheers for our world stop being a war, jump on the ship and ride to the silent\
  \ indifferent mountains."
