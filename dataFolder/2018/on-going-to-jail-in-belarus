Text: "Back in 2012, while in Russia \u2014a rare exception where we could visit without\
  \ a visa\u2014, a Colombian friend had the idea of visiting neighboring Belarus.\
  \ She looked up on the internet, found some obscure page and displayed it as irrefutable\
  \ proof that we needn\u2019t a visa for this brother country of Russia. So, we went.\n\
  \nArriving in Minsk on the overnight train was like coming out of a subway station\
  \ in Moscow without the glamour: there were no border inspections or authorities.\
  \ Indeed, we didn\u2019t need a visa to enter Belarus. The problem was getting out.\n\
  \nAfter a couple of nights, we left for Lithuania. On the train, however, one in\
  \ my group went to a back room with a smile on his face and two border officers\
  \ on his back. He came back minutes later, the smile imperturbable, and explained\
  \ the situation. We were trying to cross the border illegally because we had no\
  \ legal right to be there. Without a visa, the only place we could visit was the\
  \ inside of a police station, and we were cordially guided to one.\n\nA small room\
  \ with a slim wooden plank in lieu of bed was meant to be our accommodation. After\
  \ a long discussion in perfect Spanish and what I can only assume was flawless Belarusian,\
  \ we had concluded that the name of one of the officers was Anatoly or Anatoli.\
  \ We had also managed to fill out one form per person thanks to an elaborate and\
  \ improvised pseudo language based on hand gestures, presumably untranslatable Slavic\
  \ jargon and plenty of laughs that managed to soften, somehow, the inexplicably\
  \ already soft border officers. Happily, this also softened our beds, because we\
  \ were taken to a shabby hotel in a forgotten border town where we slept on old\
  \ mattresses instead of sharing the wooden bunk bed.\n\nThe next day a taxi driver\
  \ came to pick us up and take as much of our money as he could. He took us to an\
  \ office for our retroactive visas, drove us to the most expensive town bakery in\
  \ rural Eastern Europe and left us at the station, where he insisted against our\
  \ opinion on getting us separate berths for the two-hour ride. Anatoly or Anatoli\
  \ was there, to say adi\xF3s and excuse himself for our president and his president\
  \ not shaking hands the way we did to mimic an act of international diplomacy that\
  \ could have avoided the previous night\u2019s experience. After spending the night\
  \ in polite police detention, we left the country. In the hotel we had booked for\
  \ the previous night, we explained that we couldn\u2019t make it on time because\
  \ we were in jail in Belarus. It was alright."
