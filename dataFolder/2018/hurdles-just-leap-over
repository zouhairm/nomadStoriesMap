Text: "My name is Pursharth Bakshi and I am not frequent traveller neither I am a\
  \ famous writer but all I do is LIGHT UP THE LIVES. May be the 2500 characters are\
  \ not enough to express my feelings but the story is indeed close to my heart.\n\
  \nIt was the Friday afternoon, Sun, right up in the sky shining bright over my head,\
  \ screaming in anger as if he is trying to tell me the stroy, a story which no one\
  \ knows and no one would bother to know ever.\n\nEveryday, the same story for him\
  \ to repeat for millions of years, lights up the half of the world and leave the\
  \ other half in dark. Aren't most of the people exists in this world doing the same?\
  \ Well, the story has just begun!!\n\nThis story consists of the people who have\
  \ direct impact on me of having them in my life and I certainly believe that's worth\
  \ sharing to the global platform.\n\nWe grow up under the shelter of our parents\
  \ and we love them very much no matter what without expecting anything in return.\
  \ I love my heavenly aboard parents. They have taught me things which no one would\
  \ ever teach anyone. The integrity, loyalty, dignity, respect and morals etc I have\
  \ been taught by my very first Guru (my Parents).\nSo, I took the pride of the learnings\
  \ I have got from my parents and decided to keep them alive in this world by sharing\
  \ their values and morals with the people I meet in my journey and spread happiness\
  \ with a smile. And if I would be able to change even one life on this planet, I\
  \ would consider myself the most successful and happy man amongst the billions.\
  \ \nThey said Traveling is an emotion which cannot be explained in words. I say,\
  \ for me, Traveling is not just an emotion but it's something more than that. Just\
  \ like the nail and skin relation. You try hard enough to separate them but it will\
  \ eventually hurt you and will leave you in blood pool. I know its an emotion in\
  \ the end but few relations hurts beyond the emotions. And my relation with travel\
  \ is just as same as the nail and skin. And I believe it's something beyond all\
  \ the fancy words a happy traveler could use against it. \n\nI don't know how many\
  \ lives I have had changed with my teachings in my travel journey till date but\
  \ certainly can say proudly that somewhere I have lighted up the sky where the darkness\
  \ was residing.\nWe all are 'Sun' for some people for some reason. All we need to\
  \ do is RISE at the right time at the right place. Darkness is residing everywhere\
  \ in the world. If you can't be the SUN of the light, atleast, be the MOON of the\
  \ Dark Night!!"
