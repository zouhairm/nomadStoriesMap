Text: "Windows down, loose strands of hair whipped around my face. Oversized raindrops\
  \ fell to my windshield and onto my car door. The air cool, smelled heavy with summer.\
  \ Thunder boomed. Lightning lit up the darkened sky. I looked to my hound seated\
  \ next to me. Rooster picked up his head and vomited. Pushing strands of hair behind\
  \ my ears, I rolled up the window just enough, and sighed. \nWe had 20 miles until\
  \ the next gas station. The rain came down harder. Roadside ditches filled, drowning\
  \ buds of vegetation. \nI was driving east. Again. Two months prior, I'd driven\
  \ east to deliver photos. Four months prior, I'd driven east to pick up goats. Six\
  \ months prior, almost to the day, was Christmas, my 40th birthday, the end of my\
  \ 5.5 year relationship. The reason I was driving back and forth. \nMy ex and I\
  \ owned a farm and had a business to sort. Driving I-80 was becoming habit.\nI pulled\
  \ into the gas station noticing my low tires. In the few minutes it took to fill\
  \ them, my clothes soaked through. Long hair falling askew, a haphazard ponytail.\
  \ I tried for a haircut. No one would chop it. Concerned I was fresh from a break\
  \ up, \"wait,\" they said. \nCleaning vomit from the floor of my truck, struggling\
  \ to keep hair out of my face, sadness engulfed me. This was not the summer roadtrip\
  \ I'd intended.\nPulling out of the gas station, high-pitched noise sputtered from\
  \ the radio. The weather alert system. Pennsylvania and I-80 were under flood advisories.\
  \ Defeated in the dark, Rooster and I found lodgings and collapsed for the night.\
  \ \nThe next morning, I awoke to threatening clouds, but surrounded by green. The\
  \ Poconos. Full summer had arrived, lush and verdant. Savoring the chatter of birds\
  \ and the rustle of wildlife, Rooster and I walked to Stroudsburg, the nearest town.\
  \ \nA stubborn and particular creature, Rooster dragged me, no regard for ankle\
  \ deep puddles, clinging brambles, impassable shrubbery or throngs of coffee-bearing\
  \ humans. Nose to the ground, Rooster sniffed out\u2026a hair salon? Curious, I\
  \ tied Rooster to a meter, but a woman inside gestured to bring him. In we walked,\
  \ one muddy dog, and one disheveled girl. \nI inquired about a trim. I was introduced\
  \ to Tiffany - younger, blond, good haircut, similar height, dressed in black, possessed\
  \ of her own flair. She took us to a windowed room upstairs and gave me tea.\nPerhaps\
  \ I was affected by the soft lights or warmth of the tea. I told Tiffany about my\
  \ break up. She said if I could trust her, I looked ready for a haircut."
