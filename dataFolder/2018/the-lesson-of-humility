Text: "\u201CHumility is the greatest weapon to win someone\u201D I learned this lesson\
  \ that day.\nI was on a trip to Shimla when we decided to spend our evening strolling\
  \ through the city one day. Our first impression was not good though.\nIt was the\
  \ people there ruining it for us. They\u2019d come to us offering saffron at suspiciously\
  \ low prices. We learned later that they were selling fake products. This disgusted\
  \ us to our core. Our displeasure towards them was augmented by their attitude.\
  \ We continued our stroll ignoring them.\nAfter a while, my eyes fixed at a little\
  \ shop at one corner of a street. A middle aged man was sitting there selling wooden\
  \ key rings. He had them cut out in different shapes he\u2019d paint himself upon.\
  \ I was quite intrigued by him. While other sellers were trying hard to attract\
  \ tourists by any means; he was just sitting quietly doing his work.\nWe went up\
  \ to him and gazed at his collection of key rings. There were all beautiful; some\
  \ even marvelous. He must have been an artist in his younger days. He offered to\
  \ make some us some key rings and we started talking.\nHe told us about his time\
  \ in Shimla and how he came to the city. He used to be a painter but gave it up\
  \ after losing his family in an accident. He came to Shimla then and started doing\
  \ what he does now.\nHe told us that people, like the ones selling fake saffron,\
  \ have ruined the sanctity of the place and he wishes to keep that alive for the\
  \ tourists.\nHe showed us picture of his little girl he lost in the same accident.\
  \ She was very pretty. We were feeling very sorry for him. He deserved better.\n\
  He then showed us some photographs of him with tourists from all over the world.\
  \ People visiting his shop would end up having a picture with him because of his\
  \ work. He wouldn't charge from customers he\u2019d end up making a bond with. He\
  \ worked simply for the pleasure of meeting people and exchanging stories with them.\n\
  By the time we were done, he had made us the best key rings I\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ in my life. He politely refused to take any money from us and thanked us instead\
  \ for sharing such a great time with him. \nHe gave us 15 handcrafted key rings,\
  \ which would cost a good amount any other place, absolutely free. We sure took\
  \ pictures with him though. He added us in his collection. He\u2019d share our stories\
  \ with some other people some other day now.\nWe spent about half an hour before\
  \ bidding him good bye. He was the most amazing man I ever met who taught me an\
  \ important lesson of my life; the lesson of humility!"
