Text: "I remember coming to Bombay for the first time and being very bitter about\
  \ it. Cursing why I came but as days went by, situations changed, and an affair\
  \ started with this place. Like two reluctant people coming together in a relationship.\
  \ Here I was the reluctant lover taking his time to fall in love.And when I finally\
  \ did, I realized this city had already adopted me as one of its own the day I arrived\
  \ here. \n\nI have heard and read that people discover themselves in this \u201C\
  City of Dreams\u201D. I am sure, everyone has his own interpretations of this analogy\
  \ but I per say have my own. I didn\u2019t come to this city with a lot of dreams\
  \ but in fact leaving a lot behind from where I came, not forgetting the supposed\
  \ love of my life. I guess the need to discover Bombay stemmed from the very thought\
  \ to heal myself because of the events that had transpired in my life. I can\u2019\
  t deny the fact; this place did that for me as I gave myself to it. From what I\
  \ was to what I have become today, the city has a role to play in it. People say\
  \ this city is crowded but yet at times, you find yourself all alone. But for me,\
  \ it was in Bombay I learned to be happy in spite of being alone.\n\nThe thing about\
  \ Bombay is people come here thinking that over a period of time they will understand\
  \ the place but it\u2019s the other way round. It\u2019s a place where solitude\
  \ comes from chaos, where the distinction between the rich and the poor is hard\
  \ to miss & rain is seen as a saviour & a tormentor. Though distinct in its nature,\
  \ not only they co-exist but drive each other as well. Each deserted corner of the\
  \ city conceals a story in it, waiting to be explored. The amazing part is when\
  \ you travel within the city you experience the change in the culture unlike any\
  \ other place in our country. The sea surrounding one side of Bombay reflects an\
  \ opposite nature. While everything is on the move day in & day out, the sea remains\
  \ unconcerned. Still, it not only accommodates the need for the city to grow but\
  \ also imbibes millions of dreams & promises which are seen or made sitting along\
  \ its shore.Each face around has a story waiting to be unravelled. Stories made\
  \ by living in Bombay, travelling in trains, fighting for dreams and struggling\
  \ in rains. \n\nOver the years, I have read and found myself agreeing with a lot\
  \ of quotes on the city. I have my own version of it, which defines my relationship\
  \ with this place, \"It is this sea, in whose waves I found my shore\"."
