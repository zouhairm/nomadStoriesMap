Text: "Clack. Clack. Clack. \n\nAnother tent stake mangled by the uncompromising dessert\
  \ floor.\n\n\u201CShit!\u201D I grumbled, \u201CIt\u2019s too hard. Too dry. There\u2019\
  s no give.\u201D\n\nThe campground was as full as the moon and my frustration grew\
  \ with each reserve calorie I burned smashing that dumb hammer into Death Valley\u2019\
  s Almighty Aridity.\n\n\u201CHaving trouble?\u201D asked an old man, beer in hand,\
  \ passing along the front of our site. He stood adjacent to the picnic table where\
  \ Kylie was cooking our dinner -- chicken and rice -- on the camping stove. From\
  \ my vantage, his lower body was blurred by the flames of the campfire positioned\
  \ equidistantly between us. \n\n\u201CYes, actually,\u201D I admitted.\n\nThe old\
  \ man staggered away and returned shortly with a footlong, heavy duty tent stake\
  \ that easily pierced Hell\u2019s Fortress.  \n\nI thanked him. He lingered. It\
  \ was apparent he was expecting something quid pro quo. \u201CHungry?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \n\u201CNo, no,\u201D he said, fingering the flagon I\u2019d left sitting on the\
  \ edge of the picnic table. He was thirsty. \n\nThere was something naggingly indigestible\
  \ about the earlier conversation with the old man and I couldn\u2019t sleep. \n\n\
  I\u2019m afraid your generation will pay for the sins of mine. The old man\u2019\
  s words echoed in my head like the caw of a crow in a canyon.\n\n\u201CWhere are\
  \ you going?\u201D Kylie asked.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m going to sit in the car and listen\
  \ to the election. Go back to sleep.\u201D\n\nI zipped up the tent, opened the car\
  \ door, and reclined the driver\u2019s seat as if I were in some deluxe theatre.\
  \ Hours from cell service, I turned on the radio and felt a sort of vicarious nostalgia,\
  \ with vague reveries of FDR\u2019s Fireside Chats and Welles\u2019 War of the Worlds.\
  \ \n\n\u201CImpossible, they said. Well who\u2019s laughing now?\u201D exulted a\
  \ man on the radio. My senses piqued and I turned the dial. \n\n\u201CI can\u2019\
  t believe what we\u2019re seeing.\u201D \n\nI returned my car seat to upright and\
  \ frantically spun the dial. \n\n\u201CDonald Trump is going to be the next President\
  \ of the United States of America.\u201D\n\nIt was morning, and sand slid between\
  \ my toes as Kylie and I climbed and descended dune after dune in still-stunned\
  \ silence. The same dunes as the day before, but in a different world. \n\nThe faces\
  \ of strangers, which we\u2019d eagerly engaged the day before, we now met with\
  \ suspicion and distrust. Doubt sprouted like sequoias from all things that we had\
  \ considered certain only yesterday. \n\nWe strolled through salt-flats like a hopscotch\
  \ board to an exhibit at the end of a wooden boardwalk. It read: Badwater Basin\
  \ -- The Lowest Point in the U.S.A."
