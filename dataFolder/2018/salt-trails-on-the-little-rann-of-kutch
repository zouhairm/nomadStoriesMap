Text: "I rolled up my pants. Suddenly, I felt ashamed of my feet. Embarrassed of the\
  \ cool softness of their soles, their naivet\xE9. I was standing on the edge of\
  \ a wide, shallow pool, reflecting searing nothingness, a shimmering puddle of melted\
  \ sky in the empty desert.\n\nThe Little Rann of Kutch is the hangnail of the world.\
  \ Like a chunk of dry, dead skin, it\u2019s an uninhabitable desert splicing western\
  \ India and Pakistan, disregarded by both countries and almost all life. As the\
  \ monsoons recede, the sun guzzles up the marshes and leaves the ground to bake\
  \ and then shatter like tempered glass, puzzle pieces that used to fit now bloated\
  \ with heat and death. Shadows, rare, cut sharp. A crispy frosting of salt is broken\
  \ only by footprints of the endangered Wild Ass, bleached bones, and Agariya \u2013\
  \ the salt farmers.\n\nThat morning, as our pickup had skidded deeper into the infinite\
  \ desert, a structure materialized from the whiteness: a bamboo shanty, layered\
  \ with splayed burlap sacks and plastic bags, and shaded halfheartedly by a lonely\
  \ tree. A woman glided out. A proud, striking mirage in a breezy green and gold\
  \ sari, she offered me a cup of chai. She led me towards her salt pans, her thin\
  \ fingers encircling my wrist as if she felt weakness in my pulse. Her pulse, her\
  \ blood, ran thick and saline, and it seemed to ooze out from under her skin and\
  \ evaporate, leaving streaks of salt behind to bleach in the sun. Her skin was the\
  \ land, dusty brown, dry and webbed with cracks.\n\nI slid a bare, apprehensive\
  \ foot into the clear liquid. Lukewarm. The hard salt crystals were sharp on my\
  \ soles. My throat emitted a strange croak of surprise. She looked at me, a well-preserved\
  \ expression with a tinge of curiosity. She bent and scooped up a handful of the\
  \ large cubes and pressed them into my palms. I brought them close to my face to\
  \ study them: millions of home-grown Swarovski dice, at a cruel dollar per ton.\n\
  \nShe brought me a copper pot full of water to rinse the salt from my legs. Fresh\
  \ water was more precious than gold here, I knew, so my splashes were feeble and\
  \ reluctant. She watched disapprovingly, muttering in Kutchi, \"what kind of girl\
  \ can\u2019t even wash herself!\" I blushed crimson. Then, a subtle smile began\
  \ to erode the angles of her face, and she broke into a laugh. The small diamond\
  \ stud in her nose caught the sun and laughed too; a lone grain of salt that had\
  \ escaped its destiny. I looked down at the salty roadmap still sketched on my shins,\
  \ grateful for my embarrassing feet."
