Text: "I was not the old woman my host expected. I was a 22-year old woman (or was\
  \ I 21? God, time is a fickle beast) who had a very finite amount of time to spend\
  \ in Mongolia and an A-type obsession with lists, especially when it comes to travel.\
  \ \n\nWe emailed back and forth, me trying to arrange a tour of Mongolia through\
  \ her family's hostel, her pretty much continuously telling me that 'it's a hostel,\
  \ people don't generally book trips until they arrive'. A nice way of saying...cool\
  \ your jets, chica, you'll figure something out. \n\nArrival in Ulaanbaatar from\
  \ my year-long stint teaching in China was tired. From the battered cars and the\
  \ grey air, overcast day and generally...brown experience, it was not what I anticipated.\
  \ Mongolia was supposed to be green and the true blue sky country. And it was. I\
  \ just hadn't gotten there quite yet. \n\nI met my host, and she got me settled\
  \ in. I connected with a New Zealand couple and a couple from the States at the\
  \ communal couches in an orange living room in Mongolia...and we figured out our\
  \ trip together, from the brochures the family had on the low wooden coffee tables.\
  \ \n\nThe next morning we were off. Into the green plains of Mongolia in a beast\
  \ of a Russian truck - more than a Hummer. This thing was built to withstand most\
  \ anything. Our driver Uulzi played us Justin Bieber on the tape deck as we drove\
  \ along the single paved road and stared into the blue skies like we could be absorbed\
  \ by it - 'Baby' will always remind me of Mongolia. \n\nThere are no hotels in the\
  \ middle of Mongolia. In fact, Ulaanbaatar is really the only city. While amazing\
  \ for gazing at the stars, we relied on the generosity of others to allow us to\
  \ stay in their guest ger, with brightly painted struts and thin mattresses with\
  \ thick blankets. And we did. \n\nPlaying soccer with the children. Rolling around\
  \ in the sand of the Gobi with their youngest. Accepting their salt milk tea, and\
  \ enjoying their stories around a fire, roughly translated by our guide (while not\
  \ realising they put a fresh coat of paint on their benches, which ended up across\
  \ the back of our pants). Fishing and riding, helping them around their homes. We\
  \ made ourselves useful and shared our gifts we brought. \n\nHumanity transcends\
  \ language."
