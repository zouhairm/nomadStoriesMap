Text: "At the bus station, awkward with luggages, we were a beacon drawing stares.\
  \ Shuffling down the line of ticket counters, that universal charade - a shaking\
  \ of the head - told us that there were no buses going to Yazd. \n\nThen a voice\
  \ sounded, \"Where are you going?\" Picture this: a man, not very tall and slightly\
  \ hunched, balding, in a blue jacket with dirt streaking his cuffs, and a terrible\
  \ breath. K.O. was his name. It stood for Kassam Obedi, an inspired alias that we\
  \ now know to be false. At the time, however, there was only relief. I can bring\
  \ you to Yazd, he said, if we took him along. It was a gamble - but if not him,\
  \ then how? If not trust - then what? \n\nWe waited as K.O. scrambled up and down,\
  \ flapping cars to a stop, gesticulating furiously into each side window, until\
  \ he found one that was suitably cheap. Five of us folded into a tiny white Iranian\
  \ Peugeot, bum to bum, three in the front and back, balancing our luggage on our\
  \ knees. \n\nThen K.O. started. He was 14, a soldier in the Iran-Iraq war, and captured\
  \ for three years. \"I could not see tomorrow. I want to die. You know\u2026 they\
  \ use the most hard way to take their word from their soldiers. How many are you?\
  \ - we are ten. Beat him! How many are you? - we are ten. Beat him!\" Then, he was\
  \ soldier no more, but a treasure hunter smuggling gold to buy a yacht in Dubai.\
  \ He became a successful businessman - extremely rich, he was quick to insist -\
  \ and a proud father despite his adulterous wife. This latest story acquired fantastical\
  \ proportions as he brought his wife on First Class flights numerous times, \"all\
  \ around America. And this is how she treats me!\"\n\nAs he grew more vengeful and\
  \ angry, as he clutched his head and said it ached, the one rolling subtext in my\
  \ mind was: why are you squeezing with us if you\u2019re so rich? And everything\
  \ else crumbled then, what thin trust we already had, unspooling in five minutes\
  \ or perhaps seconds... Could we have been lucky with a homeless, smooth-talking,\
  \ English-speaking, madman?  \n\nLater, we emailed K.O. our obligatory parting photo.\
  \ His account did not exist. Who was he, really? Only indelible snatches remained:\
  \ his voice, as we raced past arid desert-scapes on flat, fat roads, towards horizons\
  \ of broad blue sky; the oval pinks of his nails gripping the headrest, slashed\
  \ with pen ink; the faint silver fuzz on his chin; our four-hour descent into his\
  \ enchanted tales - the vast adventure of his unquiet sprawl. The last, unspoken\
  \ identity rang the truest after all."
