Text: "Everything started with the decision of attending COP 22 organized by UNFCCC\
  \ in Morocco.\nNovember 14th, 7 pm, Marrakech Central Station. \nI had to take a\
  \ train to Fes with 7 hours of duration. Had a flight on 15th at 11 am to Madrid.\n\
  On the same day of my departure, everyone has warned me to be careful, as It is\
  \ not that safe. While sleeping in a cabin, somebody can easily steal your belongings\
  \ and get off on a next station. The 2nd bad news is besides City Airport Taxis,\
  \ the rest are not recommendable to take in terms of safety reasons.\nCompassion.\
  \ Humanity never dies.\nAs a sociable person, happy that wherever I travel, I always\
  \ feel free to approach locals if I need anything to ask. Riding in the train cabin,\
  \ to my delight, I noticed that I was sitting next to a lady at about 40\u2019s\
  \ speaking pretty good English. Gathering up my courage, I turned to her and asked\
  \ on how I could safely and easily go to Fes Airport from the Train Station. She\
  \ hesitated for a moment and told me exactly the same things about safety and helpful\
  \ tips on which taxi, I gotta have. She was going home in Casablanca. She even offered\
  \ me to stay in her house in Casablanca for a night and to take an early morning\
  \ train to Fes. Frankly speaking, I was so much positively surprised and grateful\
  \ to hear that from a stranger away from home, although I didn\u2019t accept it.\
  \ Such a great human being. She has even passed me her email address and asked me\
  \ to write her when I reach the Airport. This made me feel 2 things at once \u2013\
  \ overwhelmed first, thinking on how great and kind people there are on Earth thankfully,\
  \ as well as I thought the situation I was in is that serious, she even requested\
  \ me to email her about my arrival. Later on a young man probably at my age approached\
  \ me asking if I am the one who was travelling to Fes. It seems she asked nearly\
  \ every passenger on her way out if anyone goes near Fes and might be a good help\
  \ to me later on.\nOn purposes, he skipped his station in Meknes and helped me with\
  \ everything.\nLast stop. Fes. 02:25 a.m\nLong story short, as soon as we arrived\
  \ in Fes, he spoke to a taxi driver himself in French. He told me not to speak a\
  \ single word in English, that the driver shouldn\u2019t understand that I am not\
  \ local.\nOn our way to the Airport, the driver turned to the right into a dark\
  \ secluded place and stopped driving for a moment and then barely drove back to\
  \ the same highway. Seeing the airport signs on the road, I realized that I was\
  \ soon reaching the destination."
