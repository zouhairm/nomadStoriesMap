Text: "Sometimes I feel that I am getting too local here. I come to random events,\
  \ shake hands, smile and talk to people, so they start asking if I am a co-host.\
  \ Well, Greece now gives you this choice: love it or leave it. And believe me, to\
  \ fall in love with Greece takes a lot of your effort. One must have a really good\
  \ reason to stay, if he/she wants to get deeply and madly in love with this country,\
  \ despite the crises, poverty, and anarchy. \nI have my reason, and his name is\
  \ Giorgos. It is the most typical Greek name. As a true Hellene, Giorgos is a foodie\
  \ and an exquisite artistic soul. It took me two years of traveling all around Europe\
  \ to find him in the city of Eros and Hymenaeus, the ancient gods of love and marriage.\n\
  So, I have got a Greek husband and a big fat Greek family with all the intrusiveness\
  \ and care that characterize a typical Greek family, frequent gatherings for breakfasts,\
  \ lunches, dinners, coffees, funerals, and name-days. \nI have found myself a hobby\
  \ too, joining an Ancient Greek Dance group. Funny thing, all the choreographers\
  \ in the group are foreigners \u2013 expats, who came to Greece in search of an\
  \ ancient tale but couldn\u2019t find one. So, now we are creating the myth that\
  \ we have been seeking for so long and sharing all our fascination with antique\
  \ culture with Greeks. Many of them open their eyes widely and say: I have never\
  \ thought that such a thing exists, but I\u2019ve always wanted to join one.\nAnd\
  \ sometimes it gets unbearably hard to be a foreigner here. In public transport,\
  \ Greeks and migrants do not obey the basic rules, so common in the world I used\
  \ to live. A usual thing to be pushed out of the trolley just for being nice and\
  \ stepping back. The bureaucratic schemes do not allow you to get an urgent medical\
  \ care or a tax number, and you get lost in the corridors of super nice friendly\
  \ Greeks who cannot help you just because of the orders.\nBut then you go outside,\
  \ look at the sun and the sea, ancient Acropolis and colorful tavernas, and for\
  \ this Greek spirit can forgive this country everything, and simply fall in love."
