Text: "From Kingston to Balacava, I felt apprehensive. Possibly because of the winding\
  \ roads and cliffs where stubborn drivers refused to give way. Holding my breath\
  \ several times thinking that the car would topple over. I passed dry mountainous\
  \ land and families of mongoose scurrying across the road. I sat comfortably in\
  \ the back until I observed an anxious child by the road near a shop made from corrugated\
  \ metal.\nMen with rope-like hair smiled and laughed, wiping sweat from their brow.\
  \ Something about the boy grasped me. I hoped that the anxious boy would not cross\
  \ but in slow motion, he did. The men standing by the shop turned slowly, shouting\
  \ what I felt.  A loud thud alerted all passengers and bystanders as his young body\
  \ lifted six feet in the air and then slammed against the tarmac.\n The taxi driver\
  \ cradled his head shouting \"Lord God!\"  He looked at his car opposed to the boys'\
  \ injuries. In patois, an English based Creole language with West African influences,\
  \ they asked \u201CWhere him faddah? (Where\u2019s his father?)\u201D  Afraid as\
  \ my thirteen-year-old amygdala suggested that I was going to prison for murder.\
  \ By arm and leg, the boy was flung into the back of the taxi. His injury consisted\
  \ of his sitting bone sticking out of his pelvis.\nAt the Hospital, we notified\
  \ his parents while local children caught lightning bugs. Black bars covered the\
  \ house. Grandaunts and cousins introduced themselves with agitation. Your room\
  \ is in the back they directed.  On the other hand, my visit to Clarendon was phenomenal.\
  \ Meeting \u2018Uncle\u2019 whose eyes mirrored my own. A huge bungalow and veranda\
  \ with loads of wild plants poised in front of coconut trees.  \n\u2018Uncle\u2019\
  , introduced me to Quaco, a miracle bush medicinally known to heal skin rashes.\
  \ He twisted the leaves to release the juice and then rubbed it onto my skin while\
  \ cousins watched. It stung! Let food be your medicine and your medicine be food.\
  \  Uncle suggested that I attend Salt River Spa, a pond with mineral water running\
  \ from rocks adjacent to it. Located in southeast Clarendon, vultures created shadows\
  \ above my head as I swam. Four days of using Quaco and attending Salt River Spa\
  \ healed my eczema. \nI celebrated nature's cure, as it provided me with a new sense\
  \ of security and identification. I became one with nature."
