Text: "My husband and I could never agree on travel. We just couldn\u2019t see eye\
  \ to eye, and for the first few years of our marriage, I let him lead so that he\
  \ could feel safe and secure. Our first vacations were all at all-inclusive resorts.\
  \ To him, those were safe: knowing what we were getting and having it all included\
  \ in the price. We stayed at five star resorts and rarely left them. But, in 2016,\
  \ he got me the greatest gift. Not only had he booked a five-cities-in-seventeen-days\
  \ trip to Europe, but he we were going to do it \u201Cmy style\u201D. We would backpack,\
  \ stay in hostels, and couch-surf. Couch-surfing was a  new community we\u2019d\
  \ recently discovered.  Once we joined, we started getting couch-surfers from around\
  \ the world. We've had guests from the United States, Russia, New Zealand, and more.\
  \ Every visit was unique and each individual had fascinating stories. A bonus, my\
  \ children were able to hear about their love for their homelands and what they\
  \ valued. This was in stark contrast to the news which only reports on disasters.\
  \ They were learning not to fear the world, but to love it. Another bonus was the\
  \ way guests expressed their gratitude; in gifts or in kindness. We learned so much\
  \ about how kindness, and gratitude can be expressed. Unfortunately, when it came\
  \ time to plan our trip to Europe, finding homes for couch-surfing proved quite\
  \ difficult. Not many people were able to accommodate a family of four. Luckily,\
  \ a man in Copenhagen accepted our request. He proved to be one of the kindest and\
  \ most generous people. Not only did he open his small home to us, but he altered\
  \ his work schedule to give us a tour of the city. He introduced us to his favourite\
  \ shops, restaurants and landmarks and provided so much history, including that\
  \ of his own family! In each place that I\u2019ve travelled, and in opening my home\
  \ to travellers also, I\u2019ve met wonderful and kind people. I know they\u2019\
  ve had a positive impact on my children, and my husband is no longer afraid to stray\
  \ off the beaten path. Travelling often brings frustrations but the benefits outweigh\
  \ the negatives. We\u2019ve been fortunate in our experiences, and I've learned\
  \ a lot about people. It\u2019s about listening to them, learning what's important\
  \ to them, trying to understand why they feel or think the way they do. Ultimately\
  \ it\u2019s about connecting. I know we\u2019ve made life long friends in some of\
  \ our couch-surfers, and I can hardly wait to get travelling again, to continue\
  \ making local, yet global connections."
