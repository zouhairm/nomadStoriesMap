Text: "There is going to be a day in your life where you sit down and ask yourself\
  \ is it worth it? Do you\nchase your dreams or do you chase a position? However,\
  \ my question is, is there a happy medium between the two? In college at Howard\
  \ University, I stepped down from a position that I have dreamed of having for years.\
  \ It was not an easy decision, and the word \u201Cquit\u201D is not in my vocabulary.\
  \ I realized that the position would be a great opportunity, and I asked myself\
  \ if my impact was holding people back from being able to make an even greater impact.\
  \ I know that I am a dynamic leader; however, I had not given myself the opportunity\
  \ to grow and benefit as a simple member within this organization. My ambitions,\
  \ expectations, and contributions seemed to be causing contention and confusion\
  \ even though they were meant to inspire and encourage. The organization was not\
  \ mature enough for all I had to offer and the executive board members\u2019 goals\
  \ and ideas were evidently not compatible with mine. Therefore, I chose to leave\
  \ the board of my organization. I learned that though I care a lot about the members,\
  \ it is more important to see the organization get stronger because of the differences\
  \ I made while I was there. The risk was that my leaving may not yield a more successful\
  \ leadership. However, the risk would be  worth it if it set the organization on\
  \ a straighter path. I had to put the cause and members that I cared so much about\
  \ ahead of my own desires and by risking my position on the board in hopes of allowing\
  \ for a stronger group I learned that the individual, though dynamic and powerful,\
  \ is not more important than the whole."
