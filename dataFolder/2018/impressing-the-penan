Text: "Still in disbelief I find myself standing on the tarmac of a tiny airport seven\
  \ connecting flights, three days of semi-sleepless airport travel and a half a globe\
  \ away from home  The heavy humid tropical air is warm in my lungs.  The nauseating\
  \ smell of jet exhaust is almost overwhelming.  I am overjoyed to feel the gritty\
  \ soil under my feet.  My toes are anticipating the close quarters of hiking boots\
  \ as I pack away my flipflops.  A hornbill mutters unintelligible directions as\
  \ he inspects the contents of my backpack.   Here I stand, a two week jungle excursion\
  \ staring me in the eye.  Our goal is to reach a distant Penan village and stay\
  \ with these tropical nomads.  The plan is to find a local guide to take us to \"\
  said\" secluded village.  The desire is to find a guide who will also educate us\
  \ on bushcraft which can keep us out of harms way or keep us alive if the unexpected\
  \ were to make an appearance.  My traveling companion has been to Borneo three times\
  \ in the past and  possesses some knowledge of the Malay language.  I have no jungle\
  \ experience.  The only Malay I know are the few phrases one might memorize for\
  \ approaching nomadic ex-headhunters in the jungles of a foreign land.  I am hoping\
  \ the trust in myself and my skills is not misplaced.  \n  In the small local village\
  \ our queries as to guides are met with blank stares, disinterest and replies of\
  \ \u201Cyou will die out there.\u201D  While processing the locals vast knowledge\
  \ of our impending doom I spot a very colorful rooster skulking behind me.  He eyes\
  \ me as if I have challenged him to a duel.  One of the seated men points to a distant\
  \ valley and says \u201Cthey come from that way.\u201D  Our decision is to walk\
  \ in the pointed direction partially because we have nowhere else to go and also\
  \ to part from the posturing  fowl. \n Our sheer stubbornness, thirst for adventure\
  \ and willingness to sample the unknown now have us located three days trek away\
  \ from our helpful friends in the village.  Three days away from human interaction.\
  \  It is morning.  A light mist is in the air. Small rays of  light filter through\
  \ the canopy, straining to reach the earth.  I have risen from the confines of my\
  \ bug net and cautiously tiptoe my way to the trail. It is time to begin the morning\
  \ leech check. I am naked, inspecting bites and autographs left on my skin from\
  \ the local flora.  Busy with other observations it takes some time to notice the\
  \ four pairs of bewildered nomadic eyes assessing me as I stand for all to see."
