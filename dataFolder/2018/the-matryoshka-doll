Text: "My mind was blank when the country Poland came to mind. I would scroll Instagram\
  \ or Facebook and see all these wonderful, epic travel pictures and videos of people\
  \ venturing to Spain, Italy, France, Indonesia, etc. Never once did I see a cute\
  \ blog post about the trends of Warsaw, Poland. So when it came to deciding on whether\
  \ to study abroad there or not, my mind was blank. I was scared of that blank image\
  \ I conjured. I had no references, no connections, no \"how to\" guides on Poland.\
  \ However, as I got closer to the application deadline I found that blank image\
  \ to be motivating. I had the opportunity to paint that picture with my own experiences\
  \ rather than go off of other people's filters. So that summer, myself and nine\
  \ other students flew off to Poland to live for the next 3 months.\n\nWe started\
  \ in Prague and jumped to Krak\xF3w, Warsaw, Gda\u0144sk, Sopot, Hel and back to\
  \ Warsaw. I won't lie, the first few days my nerves took over my body and transformed\
  \ me into a cautious robot. I would mimc the locals behaviors to avoid being noticed.\
  \ Why was I afraid of being noticed? In America I tried to stand out as much as\
  \ I could, but here I wanted to belong, which in my mind meant hiding who I was.\
  \ It wasn't until I reached Gda\u0144sk that I began to notice a different perspective\
  \ on my behavior. Here I took classes at The University of Gda\u0144sk and met these\
  \ crazy, courageous Polish college students who lived life fuller than a hungry\
  \ hippo. They smacked their individuality on the faces of the locals, but slightly\
  \ different than most American millennials. They were strong and confident about\
  \ who they were, but walked through life on a simple and passionate life. They rationalized\
  \ complications, lived in the moment and weren't crouched over by the weight of\
  \ the world. They took me under their iron wings and showed me around the city for\
  \ the next week. I soon unhinged myself from my cautious robotic ways and became\
  \ more myself, which in turn became my most authentic local experience I've ever\
  \ had in any country. I realized that I didn't need to act a Polish girl, because\
  \ there wasn't any truthfulness in that behavior. I needed to be me, pale skinned\
  \ shoeaholic that enjoyed chocolate croissants everyday for breakfast. Poland did\
  \ change me, but also didn't. It unlocked deeper layer within myself that was more\
  \ pure than the one before."
