Text: "A fresh meal on an hour and fifteen minute flight was how Carmen and I met.\
  \ I was impressed I had been fed an actual meal. Carmen, a Colombian older woman,\
  \ agreed.  Her voice so calming, like my grandmother's once was. Noticing my Spanish\
  \ was unlike hers, she asked where I was from. Her presence, comforting. \"What\
  \ brings you to Medellin?\" Convinced she's harmless.\n\nI asked Carmen about public\
  \ transportation. I admitted I was nervous. I told her my concerns and asked her\
  \ for help.\n \nOnce deplaned, Carmen and I joined her friend, Maria Luisa, and\
  \ together, made our way through customs. I was getting anxious. Carmen informed\
  \ me she and Maria Luisa had to stop at baggage claim, but reminded me of my intent\
  \ to exchange currency. She adviced me to take care of my business, and pointed\
  \ towards the exit where we'd meet. Thank goodness I spoke the language.\n\nI didn't\
  \ see Carmen. Nor Maria Luisa. I panicked. I continued searching through the sea\
  \ of people. Maybe this wasn't meant to be, I attempted to convince myself. I couldn't\
  \ have been more grateful for the encounter, regardless.\n \nThe automatic doors\
  \ opened to the main airport lobby.  Overwhelmed at the countless people awaiting\
  \ their loved ones, I spotted them! Carmen and Maria Luisa waved me to them. Yes!\
  \ This was meant to be! \"Mija, we thought we lost you! Come with us, we figured\
  \ out your transportation.\" We walked out to meet Angelica, Maria Luisa's daughter,\
  \ who was there to greet them. I was informed I'd be joining them in their ride\
  \ home. \"But I was prepared to get my own transportation.\" Carmen insisted, \"\
  your apartment is on our way.\"\n\nArturo pulled up in a tiny Chevy Spark. Would\
  \ we fit? They had me take the front seat. I was already so grateful and had yet\
  \ to make it to Laureles. Now, I was overjoyed! This, indeed, had set a wonderful\
  \ tone for my trip! I was humbled. Or was I just lucky? I reflected back to the\
  \ worry I felt from the moment I left home.\n\nForty-eight minutes through a sea\
  \ of terracotta and neutral structures, adorned with lush greenery, livened by chaotic\
  \ roadways overfilled with motorcycling men rebelling through congested intersections\
  \ later, we arrived at the gates of my apartment complex. I thanked them all for\
  \ the ride and attempted to pay Arturo. He denied. At least to cover gas. Still,\
  \ no.  I couldn't have been more grateful for their kindness. \"I can't even explain\
  \ what you have done for me. Thank you all for your kindness. God bless.\" They\
  \ blessed me back. Indeed."
