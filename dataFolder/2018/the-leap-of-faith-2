Text: "\"3 seconds is all it takes to let go of your fear & take the leap.\n\nEven\
  \ before I realized that I've jumped from a 200 ft high bridge, it was all over.\"\
  \n\nTo jump off a bridge with just a string of ropes holding me together was a scary\
  \ thought.\n\nIn the first place I was not daring to join the group who were keen\
  \ to try this adventure activity. But I knew that this was going to be an once in\
  \ a life time opportunity.  \n\nI was put up in Athens & the Bungee jumping location\
  \ was at Corinth Canal \u2013 which was one hour drive from Athens.\n\nZulu Bungy:\
  \ the organizers of Bungee jumping looked very pumped up & confident. \n\nCorinth\
  \ Canal Bridge: Right below the bridge was the scenic water body whose magnificence\
  \ captivated my heart and in front of me was the open sky which pumped my adrenaline.\n\
  \nFirst I was made to wear the GoPro camera to capture the whole experience Live.\
  \ They made me wear the harness and locks as well. When my turn came up, I was made\
  \ to move closer to the edge of the bridge. The view was spectacular with mild breeze\
  \ hitting on my face. There were lot of instructions coming from group members \u2013\
  \ \u201Cjust look in front when you jump, jump hard, push your body out of the bridge,\
  \ etc.\u201D\n\nI took a deep breath before I looked beneath. I was not anxious\
  \ & felt that this is going to be an easy one. That is the moment when one of the\
  \ Zulu guy started counting the locks that were put on my harness. He said \u201C\
  lock 1 okay, lock 2 okay, lock 3 okay\u201D . Immediately I started thinking whether\
  \ he has actually locked all harnesses or did he miss any ? \n\nThis sent a shiver\
  \ down my spine. Suddenly I saw my whole family in front of my eyes. What will happen\
  \ if I don\u2019t come up, what if the ropes break, what if all the locks were not\
  \ in place ???? All type of weird questions popped up in a fraction of a second.\
  \ The fear of losing everything was right on my face. Do I really want to do this\
  \ and lose everything? My thought process stopped when I heard him informing the\
  \ other Zulu guy \u201Call check done\". The other guy who was standing behind me\
  \ whispered in my ear \u201Cdon\u2019t think much \u2013 just jump at the first\
  \ instance, trust me\u201D and he counted 1,2,3.\_\n\nI had 2 options 1. To turn\
  \ away without attempting the jump and be Safe 2. Trust the guy, the harness, ropes,\
  \ locks & jump in to the canal. In the blink of an eye I decided to do the \u2018\
  Leap of Faith\u2019. I trusted everything & somewhere in the corner of my heart\
  \ I prayed \u201COh God bring me back safe\u201D.  \n\n\u201CAn amazing experience\
  \ - I Did It\""
