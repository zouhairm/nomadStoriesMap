Text: "I\u2019ve already let behind my shoulders the natural power of the Cataratas\
  \ de Iguazu and I was traveling to my next stop. On the bus an old man advised me\
  \ about \u201CWanda\u2019s mines\u201D, a secret cave of precious stones, hidden\
  \ in the heart of the forest. It was something out of my travel program but I decided\
  \ to go there anyway, it sounds really interesting and adventurous. \n\nOnce I arrived\
  \ at the stop I realized that I had to across the forest alone with my backpack\
  \ to reach the entrance of the mines. The bus stop was right next to the main road\
  \ and some people standing there started saying to me that the forest was really\
  \ dangerous, because of the indigenous people, so they advised me to take a cab.\
  \ Even if I was a little worried about it I decided to proceed alone, thinking that\
  \ the advice could be some sort of \u201Ctourist-trap\u201D, and I started walking\
  \ in the direction of the forest. \n\nThe blu sky was above my head, the green forest\
  \ in front of my eyes and the red path under my feet. Suddenly I started to ear\
  \ some screams from the forest and right after sounds of running steps approaching\
  \ me. In few moment I was surrounded by a little tribe of kids from the village\
  \ that were shouting and holding out to me some precious stones. They were calling\
  \ me \u201CMr. Arbolito\u201D that in Spanish means \u201Clittle tree\u201D and\
  \ this gave me a lot of fun, because I was wearing green jacket and brown trousers.\
  \ After that moment  I started to be more relaxed. One kid said to me that I should\
  \ buy a precious stone for my girlfriend and promptly I answered that I was single.\
  \ \n\nBut that little guy knew very well the art of selling and he started to resume\
  \ all my female geneaology, with the sole purpose of selling a few stones. I was\
  \ really sorry but I had only few pesos in my pockets and  I needed them to continue\
  \ my travel. I was reflecting on a solution that could save me, without emptying\
  \ my wallet or involving the relatives of those children. Then I thought that all\
  \ over the world \u201Ckids are kids\u201D so I gave to theme some \u201Cgifts\u201D\
  , apples and snacks that I bought for the travel. A smile appeared on the mouth\
  \ of kids and started to let me and going back to their homes. \n\nOnce even the\
  \ last kid let me, I started walking again in the direction of the mines. I felt\
  \ suddenly so stupid to have thought that those kids could really attacked me. At\
  \ the same time I was really happy to discover that sometimes you are the key to\
  \ solve some uncomfortable situations, only with calm and lucidity."
