Text: "Despite having travelled all over the world, I had virtually no exposure to\
  \ the Caribbean, and it seemed high time to give it a try. Jamaica was my choice,\
  \ largely it has always had an allure as being exotic and slightly dangerous. Starting\
  \ with the landing, Jamaica delivered on both scores. Approaching Ian Fleming Airport\
  \ from the north, the amount of lush greenery is striking, and you also get the\
  \ distinct impression that you might not make the runway. \n\nThe 20-minute drive\
  \ from the airport to my accommodation captured the beauty and danger of the place,\
  \ as we traversed gorgeous seaside roads and meandered through flora that covered\
  \ the spectrum of colours \u2013 painfully cerise bougainvillea and delicately pink\
  \ jasmine; yet for security, I saw massive dogs with spiked collars, and gun turrets.\n\
  \nJamaica can be cheap if you put your own itinerary together. I was able to rent\
  \ a small, but spectacularly sited, cottage near Ocho Rios, which featured lush\
  \ gardens, and a good-sized pool, set 100m above the sea. In a massive departure\
  \ from my usual travels, the place came with a five-person staff: cook, housekeeper,\
  \ laundress, gardener and driver. The first night, the cook (Helen) prepared the\
  \ national dish of Jamaica \u2013 ackee and saltfish, with fried plantains. \n\n\
  It was spectacularly good, and I asked where she got the ingredients for the meal.\
  \ She told me she hand-picked almost everything from the local market. \nSo, 6.30\
  \ the next morning found me in the back of \u2018my\u2019 van with Helen and Gabriel\
  \ (driving) heading into Ocho Rios\u2019 town centre to pick up the day\u2019s provisions.\
  \ When I stepped out of the van, the entire tableau seemed to freeze. Heads turned\
  \ slowly towards me, mouths dropped and after what felt like ages, the buzz of the\
  \ local patois broke out. Mine was the only white face there.\n\nThe next day, Gabriel\
  \ took me to the banana plantation where his brother worked. Day three found me\
  \ at a coffee plantation, one where they grow the famous, and shockingly expensive,\
  \ Blue Mountain Coffee. On each of these day-trips, the views were spectacular,\
  \ with a colour palette that hurt the eyes, yet the roads were harrowing, and Jamaica\
  \ seems well-armed.\n\nMy Jamaican adventure was everything I imagined, due largely\
  \ to being open to the local culture, and not being afraid to put myself out there.\
  \ People respond when you show interest in their lives, and they want to learn about\
  \ your life, too. The beauty and the danger combined to etch a wonderful set of\
  \ memories in my mind."
