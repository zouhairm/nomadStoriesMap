Text: "A year and a half ago I moved to Florence Italy to get my TEFL certification.\
  \ For the 5 years I had been planning on doing this program, my plan had been to\
  \ find a job teaching in Italy. However, halfway through the 4 week program, I had\
  \ a minor freak out that I was going to need a job right after I was done. So I\
  \ started applying for jobs all over Italy, then after not hearing from any of the\
  \ Italian schools I decided to open up my job search to other countries, Taiwan\
  \ being one of them. The very next day I had an interview for the job, and 3 days\
  \ after that I had a job offer. I felt obligated to take it as this was my first\
  \ real job/job offer. So I accepted the offer on the 3rd, my program ended on the\
  \ 7th, I flew out on the 8th, landed in the evening on the 9th,and started training\
  \ on the 10th. \nWhen I moved I had promised myself that I would travel around Asia\
  \ and be more adventurous. However the first few months ended up being very hard\
  \ for me. I was suffering from depression and didn't have a support system in place.\
  \ It took a good 5 months for me to get to a place where I wasn't crying myself\
  \ to sleep and was finally making friends who I could call. This started with a\
  \ trip to the southern most city of Kaohsiung with a some of my co-workersans one\
  \ of their friends (where a little chaos and possibly an undocumented world record\
  \ occurred). A quick trip home to reenergize was then followed by a long weekend\
  \ trip to Hong Kong Disneyland with a different coworker, the friend from the Kaohsiung\
  \ trip, and a new friend (who would later become my best friend).  With each trip\
  \ and each passing month I found my confidence growing little by little. It was\
  \ shortly after getting back from Hong Kong that I decided to sign up to go paragliding.\
  \ It was something that I had always wanted to do but was too scared to do. Paragliding\
  \ was an amazing experience and it wasn't as scary as I had thought it would be,\
  \ and it has now turned me into a kind of adrenaline junkie. I almost immediately\
  \ booked a flight to go to the Philippines to go snorkeling with whale sharks. I\
  \ then was awarded the opportunity to join my friends and put on a burlesque show.\
  \ I never in my wildest dreams ever thought I'd  have the courage to get up on stage\
  \ and dance in only my underwear. Now I am back in the US preparing to move to another\
  \ new place, this time Malaysia. On the way there, I'm stopping in Hawaii to shark\
  \ cage dive, and I'm planning on doing even more while living in Malaysia."
