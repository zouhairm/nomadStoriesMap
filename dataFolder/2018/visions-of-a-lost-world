Text: "Before the Arab Spring, before the protests, before the ceaseless civil war\
  \ and it\u2019s never ending tide of refugees, we wandered through Syria. We came\
  \ for a glimpse of the ruins of past cultures \u2013 never thinking we were walking\
  \ though the ruins of the future. \n\nWe found ourselves in Hama, Syria. Known for\
  \ it\u2019s ancient water wheels, the government crackdown in the 80\u2019s, and\
  \ now for this war\u2019s destruction. The buildings and streets we wandered are\
  \ gone now: another archeological layer buried underfoot.\n\nOne evening as we walked\
  \ down a dusty street, a man appeared in the doorway of a store. \u201CCome!\u201D\
  \ he said motioning with his hands. Not knowing what to expect, we entered a tiny,\
  \ gray, hardware store. Inside a distinguished looking older man and a teenage boy\
  \ greeted us. Seats were offered and soon small glasses of tea appeared. The shopkeeper\
  \ and the boy spoke almost no English, but the other man spoke a bit. We started\
  \ a remedial conversation aided by our Arabic phrase book and his small Arabic/English\
  \ dictionary. \u201CWhere are you from?\u201D the older man asked. \u201CAmerica\u201D\
  , we said. They smiled and nodded. The man said the shopkeeper and the boy were\
  \ Syrian, but he was Iraqi. He and his family were in Syria because of the war in\
  \ Iraq. He said he bore no anger towards us, \u201CI love American people, but not\
  \ the soldiers. America should leave Iraq, then I go home.\u201D As the hour of\
  \ prayer neared we said our goodbyes.\n\nOn our last day in Hama we saw the Iraqi\
  \ on the street.  When we told him we were leaving that day he invited us to meet\
  \ his family. After a short walk we arrived at his home where he introduced us to\
  \ his wife and their 6 daughters (ranging in age from 18 to a toddler). Over fragrant\
  \ cinnamon tea and sliced apples, we talked. They shared a grainy phone video of\
  \ their home taken the day they left. It was a lovely home, on a mist shrouded river.\
  \ The video was a potent reminder of all the family had left behind. The modest\
  \ rental apartment in Syria where we sat was no match for the family\u2019s home\
  \ and way of life in Iraq.  Even though the conversation was heavy with the family\u2019\
  s losses the visit was not a sad affair.  We talked about their children and laughed\
  \ at their antics. I held their pudgy sweet baby in my lap. All too soon, it was\
  \ time for us to leave. \n\nAfter we left Hama we emailed back and forth, but then\
  \ they no longer replied. They became like ghosts: sadly beyond our help, but a\
  \ reminder of our shared humanity and the importance of hospitality."
