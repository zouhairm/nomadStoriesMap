Text: "Has torrential rain ever put a stop to your travel plans? Made you feel like\
  \ your holiday is ruined? Well, I prefer to see it as an opportunity to do something\
  \ I normally wouldn\u2019t have done, and one time it led to an amazing experience.\
  \ It all started when my partner and I were driving down the West Coast of New Zealand,\
  \ known for its miserable weather and prehistoric sized mosquitos, but also for\
  \ its beautiful glaciers and scenic coastal drive. The rain was so bad that we could\
  \ barely see meters in front of us and we were not about to spend another 2 hours\
  \ driving to get to Wanaka, especially since night fall was almost upon us. So,\
  \ we decided to stop for the night in a small township called Haast, and when I\
  \ say small, I mean a petrol station, and a few shops small. Luckily, they had accommodation\
  \ and a bar where we could get a hot meal and have a drink before resting after\
  \ a 6 hour drive. We grabbed a couple of beers and sat down at the bar waiting for\
  \ our fish and chips. A local farmer, wearing his typical gumboots and stubbies\
  \ took a seat next to us and introduced himself as Hemi. We talked about the bad\
  \ weather, our travels and what to do in Haast, which to be honest, wasn\u2019t\
  \ a lot. That is when Hemi offered to take us to see a local hidden treasure with\
  \ his Wife Jane, who was a conservationist. The next day we pulled on our gumboots\
  \ and zipped up our jackets, thankfully the previous downpour turned into a slight\
  \ sprinkle. Hemi and Jane meet us outside the dense forest, something you would\
  \ expect to see in Jurassic park. We walked for a few hours through the mushy forest\
  \ floor, followed by a flock of fantails who were more than happy to eat the bugs\
  \ that we uncovered by our footsteps and then we were hushed, by what sounded like\
  \ a squawk. Jane then pointed towards a small creek and we couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ it. Fricken yellow eyebrowed penguins called Tawaki in the middle of the forest,\
  \ hours away from the sea. We sat and watched in awe as part of their charm was\
  \ their crazy antics and adorable clumsiness, they didn\u2019t seem to mind our\
  \ presence at all, even coming to investigate, then quickly scampering away. Some\
  \ travel tips when travelling the west coast, It can get very wet, so bring a jacket\
  \ and umbrella, you will need some insect repellent and a baseball bat for the Mossies,\
  \ bring plenty of snacks as you don\u2019t know when the next time you will see\
  \ civilization again, and make sure you talk with the locals because you never know\
  \ what they might show you."
