Text: "The last thing I expected as we rounded the corner was to hear the unmistakeable\
  \ strains of \u201CDespacito\u201D being played on a violin. Naturally, we walked\
  \ over to investigate. The player was a young woman and she was clearly incredibly\
  \ talented. A crowd quickly formed and soon they were dancing and requesting songs,\
  \ which she happily played, even if it meant looking them up on her phone first.\
  \ A man who had been sitting alone on a bench nearby started dancing and was having\
  \ so much fun, he soon pulled a partner from the crowd. Minutes ago, they were strangers\
  \ but for a few moments the music brought them together and we all got to share\
  \ in their laughter.\nWhile the choice of song might have been unexpected, this\
  \ was a pretty typical Saturday night on Royal Street in New Orleans\u2019 French\
  \ Quarter. Music is part of the fabric of the city and it\u2019s unusual to go more\
  \ than a block on the weekend without hearing some form of music \u2013 usually\
  \ the jazz the city is famous for. Competition is fierce, so the musicians tend\
  \ to be incredible.\nThis was my second trip to the city, and I made the choice\
  \ to stay in the French Quarter again. It\u2019s a city made for walking and staying\
  \ in the Quarter puts you in the centre of the action \u2013 surrounded by the architecture,\
  \ music, art galleries and antique shops. It\u2019s easy to spend 10 days walking\
  \ around and still not find all the secrets hidden in this small part of the city.\
  \ Plus, by walking you can justify all the of the eating you will do at the many\
  \ restaurants throughout the city. \nI\u2019m not a fan of Bourbon Street, for me\
  \ it has all the seediness of King\u2019s Cross in Sydney and none of the charm\
  \ of the rest of the French Quarter. I much prefer Frenchmen Street with its Jazz\
  \ Clubs or the buskers on Royal Street \u2013 many of whom have played professionally\
  \ in places like New York. I loved spending Sunday walking through Jackson Square\
  \ watching the artists paint while buskers played jazz in front of the Cathedral.\
  \ Then whiling away the afternoon at Bamboulas on Frenchmen Street, listening to\
  \ whatever live music they had, drinking cider and relaxing.\nThe French Quarter\
  \ is the tourist hub of New Orleans but the mistake most tourists make is spending\
  \ only a few days in the city, visiting Bourbon Street, eating beignets and maybe\
  \ visiting a cemetery. There is so much more to the Quarter and you never know what\
  \ is around the next corner. One day it might be a girl with a violin, the next\
  \ it might be a marching band. The joy comes from not knowing."
