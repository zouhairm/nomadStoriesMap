Text: "My knuckles turned white as I gripped the top rail of the boat tighter. We\
  \ crashed down into another wave, the spray hitting my face and momentarily making\
  \ me forget how nauseated I really was. There had been an announcement ten minutes\
  \ earlier requesting all passengers on deck return to the cabin. By now everyone\
  \ had except myself, and I refused. I didn't want to return the breakfast I had\
  \ eaten to anywhere except the ocean.  When the boat had set out toward the Aaron\
  \ Islands it had been dreary, but calm; now, the skies darken, the winds howl, and\
  \ the waves have grown beyond what this small boat was built for.  \n  \u201CHi.\u201D\
  \ I heard a voice come from behind me. Without loosening my grip from the rail,\
  \ I turn my head to see an older gentleman, about an inch taller than myself, and\
  \ in tight spandex shorts standing next to me.  I manage a nod.\n \u201CYou're lookin'\
  \ a bit green. Why don't you come in.\u201D He said in a lilting Irish accent.\n\
  \ I shook my head no, \u201CI'm going to be sick.\u201D\n \u201COk...\u201D He said\
  \ nodding and turning to look behind him. \u201CHow bout' we sit on that bench right\
  \ there?\u201D\n I knew he didn't want me to wash overboard, and frankly neither\
  \ did I. The waves had grown stronger, and he made sense, moving away from the edge.\
  \ We walked over to a bench right outside the doors of the cabin. I sat down, and\
  \ to my surprise he sat down next to me. \n  \u201CName's Aedan, I run cycling tours\
  \ the world over\u2026\u201D He began telling me tales of all the places he's led\
  \ groups, through France, Italy, even the Sahara Desert. He gave recommendations\
  \ on what to see and do, where to go, and the best places to eat were in both the\
  \ Aaron Islands, and where we had come from in Doolin. He spoke of where to visit\
  \ in Ireland, and every topic he could think of to keep my mind off my stomach and\
  \ the sea.  I listened in fascination to his tales, and suggestions, and when I'd\
  \ start to feel nauseous again, he would pull my focus back to him with a question.\
  \ \u201CAre ya sure there's no Irish in ya? With your blonde hair and blue eyes,\
  \ you've got to be.\u201D I would respond with another head shake for no, not trusting\
  \ my mouth to open in fear that words may not be what came out. When we pulled into\
  \ port, the outbound trip had been canceled due to the weather. Aedan gathered up\
  \ his tour group, and wished me farewell. I thanked him, a few times. We parted\
  \ ways, and off I went in search of the ruins Aedan had told me about. I will be\
  \ eternally grateful for Aedan's concern, and his distraction on the water that\
  \ day."
