Text: "In this moment, I am floating. Weightless. My eyes are closed under the water\
  \ and the wave breaking over my head rumbles in it\u2019s own peculiar way, demanding\
  \ to be recognized as unique. I\u2019ve listened to quite a few waves express this\
  \ sentiment above me on this warm, November afternoon. Each one with it\u2019s own\
  \ character and emotions. Many waves come in with a sense of peace, rolling through\
  \ the currents with an air of leisurely nonchalance. It\u2019s easy to tell that\
  \ these waves have done this before. That they greet the sand and rocks ahead as\
  \ if they are old friends, despite knowing that they will be broken into tiny pieces,\
  \ never assembled in this specific way ever again. But some waves come roaring through,\
  \ full of rage, as though they have not yet fully accepted the inevitable demise\
  \ that awaits. Even from below the surface, you can hear the fury that demands that\
  \ they are in control, that expects the shoreline to bend to the sheer force of\
  \ their being.\_But of course, it never does.\n\nI am the second wave.\_\n\nI feel\
  \ the sudden pressure as my leg is jerked away from me, the surfboard strap digging\
  \ in deeper to the raw flesh of my ankle. The wave above has picked up my board\
  \ and is now hurling us towards the shore. I\u2019m rolling, tumbling, unsure of\
  \ which way is up. My lungs burn from lack of oxygen and just as I think I can\u2019\
  t hold out any longer, I am unceremoniously deposited onto the beach. I open my\
  \ red, salt-stung eyes and am taken aback to find pair of small, brown eyes peering\
  \ back at me.\_\n\n\u201CEstas bien?\u201D\n\nI nod back and the Nicaraguan boy\
  \ appears satisfied. He gives me a beaming grin before turning and sprinting into\
  \ the waves with his own board. The ocean pulls him out gently and I watch the two\
  \ work together in harmony. The boy moves effortlessly through the water. He is\
  \ graceful, free of expectations, accepting whatever the ocean offers him. I can\
  \ almost see the waves acknowledging his respect for them. They lift him up and\
  \ send him racing down the face of a wave, his dark skin glistening in the sunlight,\
  \ his face a mask of tight concentration and unbridled joy.\_\n\nEvery muscle in\
  \ my body aches, my skin is raw and the saltwater that burns my eyes and throat\
  \ has become a familiar companion. I look out blearily and concede defeat, relinquishing\
  \ the idea of commanding the ocean to do my bidding. At that moment, another wave\
  \ breaks in front of me and comes rushing up to greet me, swirling around my ankles.\
  \ It beckons like an old friend, \u201CCome try again.\u201D"
