Text: "I ricocheted around the soft cab bouncing off hard bodies as our rickety VW\
  \ van rocketed up the crushed roadways of the Andes. The Andes glistened in emerald\
  \ while rolling and dropping as the VW\u2019s windows gave up on the ground and\
  \ sent us into fog. We began in The City of Eternal Spring, Medellin. In the \u2018\
  90s, Medellin was one of the most dangerous cities in the world where children were\
  \ seldom allowed outside after dark, kidnappings were commonplace, and the homicide\
  \ rate loomed atop every chart. People just disappeared. \nDiego, his thick dark\
  \ curls floating around his head like feathers, was piloting our van. He bounced\
  \ in his seat, jostling as if his body itself was embedded into the vehicle; his\
  \ movements saving us from cascading back to solid land. Our co-pilot, Rafael, spoke\
  \ English as if a Cheshire grin were required to form the words. \u201CYou amigos\
  \ A-Okay? Diego is the best driver in all of Colombia.\u201D Both burst into laughter.\
  \ Rafeal passed me a piece of pineapple like it would calm me. Its freshness mimicked\
  \ butter, melting. I savored the tart creaminess of the fruit.\nAfter an entire\
  \ day of bridge jumping and hiking the 740 steps to the summit of the granite juggernaut\
  \ El Pe\xF1\xF3n de Guatap\xE9, I was feeling courageous. Our van careened around\
  \ a corner to come across a young man wearing a set of drums like a backwards backpack\
  \ and a harmonica like a low-hung halo. Our van slammed to a stop. Rafael spoke\
  \ with the young man and then looked back at us, \u201CThis man plays beautiful\
  \ music. He needs a ride. Please, you do not have to pay him.\u201D He played. His\
  \ music was laced with energy and intensity sending the cab into a boisterous rattle.\
  \ His glee radiated from under his scuffed, red cap as our van seemed to chug up\
  \ the steep incline off bliss. At the top, he expressed his thanks and floated out\
  \ into the evening.\nThe sun settled as we weaved through the darkness back to Medellin.\
  \ Rafael started the documentary, Los Dos Escobar, on the small TV rigged to the\
  \ ceiling of the van. I was transfixed by the extortion, murders, and bloody rampage\
  \ Pablo Escobar ramped up and drained from Colombia through the \u201890s. Rafael\
  \ looked back at us after looking at Diego, \u201CWe were very young.\u201D The\
  \ epiphany struck me like a landmine. Diego and Rafael were my age. They had grown\
  \ up enduring sleepless nights as the cacophony of gunfire scattered their glimpses\
  \ of sleep and safety. Rafael ruffled Diego\u2019s curls, \u201CIt\u2019s okay.\
  \ Our life is getting better. We\u2019re still here.\u201D"
