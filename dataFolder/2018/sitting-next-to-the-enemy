Text: "Although I love travelling I have to admit that I am very tense every time\
  \ I have to take the plane, this time the tension was different, next to me there\
  \ was a young man with a passport in his hand, a Haitian passport.\n\n As a Dominican\
  \ woman I have never had a conversation with a Haitian citizen, not because I have\
  \ something against them but because we were raised to fear them. I am ashamed to\
  \ admit that while living abroad, when I encounter people from our neighbor country\
  \ I try to skip them. Partly because I do not know how to react and also because\
  \ I have already experienced rejection when a common friend introduced me \u201C\
  someone from my island\u201D. \nNow, at 16,000 feet of high, on an 8 hours Paris-\
  \ New York flight there was no much where to go.\n\nAfter basic introduction, he\
  \ asked me the feared question: - so where are you come from? \n-I am Dominican\
  \ I replied in a whisper.  \n- Dominican? he said to himself\n\nAfter a moment of\
  \ hesitation that seems like an eternity he looked me straight into the eyes and\
  \ with a curious expression he asked me, so what brings you to New York in this\
  \ cold season? The following was the most exciting 8 hours flight that I never had.\
  \ \n\nWe talked about trivial matters like sports, the fact that nobody understand\
  \ why we are cold at 17\u2103 s and how much we missed the sea. Then we passed to\
  \ serious matters like why there is such tension between our countries, we even\
  \ laughed when each one told how the history is taught in each side of the island.\
  \ For the first time he could tell to someone the terrible experience he lived during\
  \ the earthquake. My eyes filled with tears and I could almost feel on my own skin\
  \ the nightmare he was telling.  I felt a cold in my back knowing that this happened\
  \ just next to us, just-next-to-us.\n\nIt is funny that we both grew on the same\
  \ island, yet we have to speak in English to communicate with each other. The division\
  \ between our countries seems so big yet our seats where so close. He is my \u201C\
  neighbor\u201D but I knew so little about his country.  \n\nI do not know if it\
  \ was fate, but from all the people I could bump into, I ran into the lease expected\
  \ \u201Ctravel buddy\u201D. This is one of those people that you meet for a reason.\
  \ \n\nThis trip made me think, now we are living in a high tech advanced society,\
  \ the century of the cultural empathy and open-mindedness. We are still talking\
  \ about building walls, we are still educating to fill apprehension between countries."
