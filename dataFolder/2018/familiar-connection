Text: "With my photographic passion in jaipur. I felted essence of belonging with\
  \ people. I was staying in hotel. The area was full of slum people. Along with my\
  \ Canon camera. I went to that slum people they went crazy and thought me as a director.\
  \ They were wanted me to shoot them and they had started giving me the idea of their\
  \ own. They were showing me their own home.it was like somebody is helping me. The\
  \ area was full of garbage and they had their room on the turf of the garbage. I\
  \ could realise that they are living a tough life but they were quite satisfied\
  \ with their life. \nI could realise their experience because I had some this kind\
  \ experience in my past days.\nA girl with beautiful grayish eyes attracted me for\
  \ the first time in the slum.i shot her. I captured some moments that I didn't wanted\
  \ to shoot but when I saw those wanted images my jaw was dropped. I think the best\
  \ photographs came in from those. I had a list of top 5 places of jaipur. One was\
  \ a Fort that is known as AMER FORT. I was travelling by the bus. Keeping on hand\
  \ on my camera eagerly waiting for something that can explain a moment as I stayed\
  \ in jaipur I was feeling very comfortable with them.it was like they know me already\
  \ and as I wanted to shoot I found all those resources that could help me to get\
  \ that shot. People were quite adjustable they were supporting me just something\
  \ or somebody helping me.i didn't tried to made the experience fancy. Because I\
  \ wanted to feel the same like in my past days.i had a trip of 8 days. colours are\
  \ the speciality of jaipur. When you travel across the city I saw paintings on bridges\
  \ of jaipur and brides colour was Royal. Weather change very quickly when it have\
  \ to change. I was very acceptable as a camera man. People had started calling me\
  \ PHOTO MAN. it was beautiful experience for anybody who visit jaipur."
