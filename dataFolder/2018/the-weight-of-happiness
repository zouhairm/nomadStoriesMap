Text: "Backpack is ready. I am ready. \nThe weight on my shoulders has never been\
  \ so light before, that\u2019s the weight of Happiness and Freedom. Panauti was\
  \ the name of the Nepali village. \nI can still remember the colors around me, the\
  \ houses trying not to fall down and the green expanses. I was walking along a slippery\
  \ path leading to a wonderful sunset crossing my eyes. I could see the orange sun\
  \ lying down on the fields with men still working the lands. I didn\u2019t have\
  \ a real plan, I just had my small tent and my warm sleeping bag kept in my backpack\
  \ and it was enough. I would have slept on the ground if necessary, when a little\
  \ girl crossed my way. Malila, that was her name. \nShe was staring at me, like\
  \ a stranger thing, without saying a word and we looked in each other eyes for a\
  \ few minutes. Then she smiled, she probably decided to offer me her trust, her\
  \ friendship, her beauty and I embraced it as a gift, something rare that I was\
  \ lucky to own. Even if for some hours, I couldn\u2019t deserve more than that.\
  \ After I got lost in her eyes she took my hand: hers was small and skinny. She\
  \ was wearing a dirty red t-shirt and ripped blue trousers when, suddenly, I had\
  \ a look at her feet: she was wearing two slippers, bigger than her proper size,\
  \ held together with a thick rope, so that she could walk. It broke my heart and\
  \ tears came to my eyes. \u201CNo, I can\u2019t cry\u201D. I couldn\u2019t let her\
  \ feel my sadness because that was her life, that was probably her happiness and\
  \ I really wanted to share it with her. We walked together to a small tiny house\
  \ where there was a man sat on a wooden chair, warming his hands up in front of\
  \ a shy fire. He was Malila\u2019s father and, just in that moment, I realized I\
  \ would have been their guest for the night. I don\u2019t know why but she chose\
  \ me on that day. I won\u2019t forget that moment, something unreal, blissful. The\
  \ man hugged me with such a warm harm and he welcomed me to go inside the house\
  \ and he told me: \u201CYou can sleep here tonight. We have a bed and a dish for\
  \ you\u201D. I smiled, without saying a word, and Malila and her father smiled,\
  \ too. We talked a lot about our cultures and our lives. We were so different but\
  \ we had so much in common that I still wonder how similar human beings can be around\
  \ the world. I still wonder if Malila knows there is another possible world, another\
  \ possible life that she deserves to live but, what I know, is that I saw happiness\
  \ in her eyes and this is the best memory I want to keep. \nEverybody should be\
  \ Malila."
