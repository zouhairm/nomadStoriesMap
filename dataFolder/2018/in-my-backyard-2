Text: "Everything seemed to start just fine. The couple fell asleep immediately, and\
  \ the sister was going on and on about her son a doctor, and equally accomplished\
  \ daughter. It was the first time on a tour for me, but I was easing into it by\
  \ throwing my best jokes. The trip was supposed to be simple, and after some delay\
  \ with road works, we had finally entered Bosnia.\n\nSoon we were facing a huge\
  \ traffic jam, and decided to avoid a car crash by taking a detour. The road was\
  \ narrow and winding, full of trucks, dust and trash. Daylight was gone and still\
  \ no sign of Sarajevo. After considerable wandering, we finally reached their hotel.\
  \ Awkwardness.\n\nWe had to prepare for the next day: find the Tunnel of Hope on\
  \ the outskirts of the city. With no road signs or helpful sites available, my best\
  \ bet was the receptionist. He was kind enough to help, and we embarked on our journey\
  \ in the middle of the night following his instructions. \u201EHey, when you get\
  \ back make sure to park with the tank facing the reception so the security can\
  \ keep an eye. Gas gets robbed around here!\u201C, he added. What decade was I in?\n\
  \nThe next day we headed to the tunnel. It was the only contact with the outside\
  \ world during the siege of Sarajevo in the 1990s. I got out of van first, and squeezed\
  \ the knob.\nLocked.\nBut the board was there, just like last night. I broke a cold\
  \ sweat. All of a sudden a man pulled over. \u201CLooking for the tunnel?\u201C\
  , he asked. \u201EThis part is closed, I can show you how to get to the entrance\u201C\
  .\nHope!\n\u201ESure thing\u201C, I started. \u201EY'know, pension funds are so\
  \ low in Bosnia these days\u201C, he went on. I broke another sweat. My first tour\
  \ and I was already spending my paycheck! \u201EHow much would you value this help?\u201C\
  , I said. We agreed on a price as I tried to keep it cool. This must be how wartime\
  \ felt, I thought to myself.\n\nThe images we saw in the tunnel were heartbreaking.\
  \ Buildings in flames, people dead in the streets. I was a kid when it all happened.\
  \ On our way out, my clients felt like some shopping. I was sickened. How could\
  \ they shop after having seen this?\nThe man at the shop started telling his story.\
  \ He was actually driving all the rubble from the tunnel. They had to get rid of\
  \ it in the middle of the night so no one would suspect anything. \u201EYou know\
  \ how many times I'd passed that route? Over hundred times back and forth. You know\
  \ what the worst part was? I couldn't even have a smoke, or else a Serbian sniper\
  \ might have taken me out! Imagine that\u201C, he said.\n\nI felt kid again."
