Text: "The round faced Bhutanese monk opened the battered tin where I deposited my\
  \ offering. He handed me three worn dice and gestured for me to throw them onto\
  \ the pile of dirty notes. \n\nI threw eight. Our guide Neten told me to throw again.\
  \ \n\nTwelve. The monk nodded and Neten said, \u2018That is auspicious.\u2019 \n\
  \nI waited for more, to find out what good fortune awaited me but it was Neten\u2019\
  s turn. \n\nHe clutched the dice to his forehead, eyes closed. His first throw was\
  \ 14. He threw again. 14 but in a different configuration. The final throw was also\
  \ 14. I looked at my husband, our eyes wide, while the two men spoke in Dzonghka.\
  \ Neten prostrated himself before the gilded Buddha, and then we left the solitary\
  \ monk in the tiny rundown monastery to walk back down into the wide mountain valley.\n\
  \n\u2018So 14 was auspicious?\u2019 I asked.\n\n'Very. The number is special to\
  \ yesterday\u2019s monastery.\u2019\n\nVisiting the Lungchu Tsey monastery had involved\
  \ a magical climb through mist shrouded rhododendron forest that dripped with moss,\
  \ tree ferns and fungi. In Neten\u2019s typically reticent way, it wasn\u2019t until\
  \ we reached the top, after a muddy two hour walk, that he told us how important\
  \ the pilgrimage was. \n\n\u2018And you rolled 14, three times in a row. Isn\u2019\
  t it extra auspicious?\u2019 \n\nI expected amazement, joy, explanation. Something\
  \ more than serene pragmatism. But Neten just nodded and smiled.\n\nHis reaction\
  \ exemplified Buddhism in Bhutan, in my superficial experience. Religion is all\
  \ pervasive, infusing every part of life and the landscape with imposing monasteries,\
  \ elaborate rituals, fantastical myths of demons and bodhisattvas. Entire communities\
  \ turn out regularly for spectacular festivals of music and dance. \n\nAnd yet,\
  \ there is such a quiet humility in the practice, so evident in Neten. Our constant\
  \ companion for two weeks was a modest and thoughtful man.\n\nAs a fiercely independent\
  \ traveler, it is not easy to succumb to the strictures of travel in Bhutan. There\
  \ were times I wanted to escape, to have an experience unmediated by a government\
  \ sanctioned guide. But I came to realize, sheepishly, how essential his cultural\
  \ interpretation was; his subtle advice on protocol or his deft side-stepping of\
  \ my overly blunt, inappropriate attempts to discuss contentious issues.\n\nThe\
  \ dice rolled our way. We got lucky with our guide. Our constant conversation provided\
  \ a depth of insight into this mysterious country that I've rarely experienced on\
  \ other travels. \n\nAnd in Neten Dorji we made a new friend."
