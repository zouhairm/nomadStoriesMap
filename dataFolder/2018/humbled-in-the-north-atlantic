Text: "Pablo drummed the wheel and sang along to punk as we crossed the stone bridge\
  \ and headed out along the coast. I was staring at the deep green Galician hills\
  \ that arch one after the other into the sea, wondering how I ended up in a van\
  \ with someone I just met. I was tired, groggy and not exactly sure where we were\
  \ going but had been promised that the North Atlantic will cure all of my woes.\n\
  \nWhen we got to the beach, he jumped out, slid open the door and tossed me a wetsuit.\
  \ I kicked off my shoes and started to muscle the thick, tight suit over my heel\
  \ as he watched, smiling, effortlessly slipping into his. When I finally got in,\
  \ Pablo zipped me up, passed me a board and we headed down to the sand. \n\nAfter\
  \ a few stretches and some paddling movements, I followed him into the April sea,\
  \ smile on my face, feeling like my beach bum soul had finally been freed from my\
  \ midwest upbringing and as a lifelong snowboarder, I assumed after a few warm-up\
  \ runs, I\u2019d be shredding waves for the day. \n\nHopeful, I watched waves come\
  \ in, tried to paddle to catch them at just that right moment and then stand up.\
  \ Finding it difficult to center my weight on the wobbly board, I leaned a little\
  \ right and fell face first into the wave. Next, overcompensated left and I fell\
  \ backwards. When I stopped paddling to focus on centering my weight, the wave rolled\
  \ right underneath me and I had to turn, paddle back and wait for another. Meanwhile,\
  \ Pablo cruised by me, giving encouragement, \u201CYou can do it Meech-ee-ghan!\u201D\
  \ \n\nI managed to semi-one-knee-crouch some waves in and then, after swirling underwater,\
  \ had to orient myself, pull my board in, take a breath, duck a wave, pop up, start\
  \ paddling, take a breath, go under another wave, paddle and repeat. As determined\
  \ as I was, I got worn down mentally and physically. \n\nShortly after I retired\
  \ to the beach, Pablo jogged over to me, motioning with his head towards the parking\
  \ lot. He opened the van door, grabbed a bag, pulled out a bocadillo and gave it\
  \ to me. I said thanks and peeled back the foil to see that it was the Spanish omelette\
  \ or \u2018tortilla\u2019 on a baguette. We sat on the curb in front of the van\
  \ with our sandwiches, looking out into the afternoon sun on the sea and at the\
  \ little silhouettes that bobbed with the tide.\n\nI didn\u2019t realize my dream\
  \ of shredding waves, didn\u2019t even stand on the board that first day but it\
  \ was unforgettable. I was humbled, determined to give it another shot and grateful\
  \ for the friends one can make in a pub far from home."
