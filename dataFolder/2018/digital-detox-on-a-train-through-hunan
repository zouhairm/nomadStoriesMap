Text: "I watch as the screen crumbles. Flickering shapes. At First, it seemed still\
  \ partly usable. But as soon as I touched the screen, it spread, covering the display\
  \ in a flashing mess of noise and random patterns. I sigh. I am sitting in the canteen\
  \ of a campsite hidden away in the Western part of Zhangjiajie National Forest Park\
  \ as Disaster unfolds. I planned to do some work.\n\nZhangjiajie is China\u2019\
  s first and its most famous National Park, UNESCO world heritage. Crowded with tourists.\
  \ Normally. That\u2019s what I expected. To my amazement, I found myself the sole\
  \ guest on this campsite. On the verge of Chinese national holidays! I rented a\
  \ tree-suspended tent here, mats, sleeping bag, tent already pitched \u2013 all\
  \ inclusive.\n\nThe weather is moist, drizzling rain, clouds of fog. Sooner or later,\
  \ towards the weekend, it fills up. Few more campers arrive, tents already pitched\
  \ for them. The concept of enduring discomfort of camping in the dirt and rain is\
  \ something alien to most Chinese however, so the campers move inside, snuggling\
  \ up in cozy indoor-tents! I still enjoy the comfort and solitude of my flying tent\
  \ in the wild. I don\u2019t mind the drops, I appreciate the cool breeze.\n\nI spend\
  \ days strolling through the vast area of the park, through forests and gorges,\
  \ up and down on staircases and cobblestone trails. Between towering quartz-sandstone\
  \ pillars, overlooking the karst-like landscapes, the distinct and unique features\
  \ of the park. Just follow the rule: The more you have to hike, the fewer tourists\
  \ you meet.\n\nIt was an adventure to find this campsite, it wasn\u2019t on my map.\
  \ I just had an online booking. Nobody speaks English, and my Chinese is limited\
  \ to a few necessary words and numbers. Conversations go through a translation app.\
  \ You talk to your phone, the phone speaks with your vis-\xE1-vis. It works. Sometimes.\
  \ Technology will save us.\n\nBut Technology just had let me down. Back in Zhangjiajie\
  \ \u2013 the town \u2013 I am about to embark on a very long train ride as I notice\
  \ I lost my e-book reader. My phone is running out of credit, losing China\u2019\
  s ubiquitous 4G network. At Shenzhen, I will fix it. But what to do now without\
  \ a laptop, no e-book, no phone, no signal, not even a book, I ask myself \u2013\
  \ and Facebook.Trying to find a local connection? Improve my Chinese?\n\nI enter\
  \ the compartment: My mate does not even look up from her phone.\u201CBuy a notebook,\
  \ a good pen and write down your travel stories,\u201D a friend had advised me,\
  \ \u201CI would read it.\u201D I open a beer and start writing."
