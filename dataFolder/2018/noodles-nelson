Text: "I hurriedly brushed back my hair and assumed a winning smile as I tried desperately\
  \ to make eye contact with the dapper cadet studiously making his way up the hill.\
  \ \n\nThus far my travels in Japan had not been an overwhelming success- whilst\
  \ I had mastered the ubiquitous vending machines however was still carrying around]children's\
  \ chopsticks and had once again  managed to mix up the bathroom and bedroom slippers.\
  \  That morning I had had enough of the well meaning advice and smothered laughs\
  \ of my travel group as I made yet another cultural faux pas and had waved the m\
  \ off to the Itsukushima Shrine.\n\nAs the A Bomb Dome dominates Hiroshima like\
  \ a sentinel keeping watch over the city- the neighbouring town of Kure is similarly\
  \ inextricably twined with its war history due to the battleship behemoth Yamato.\
  \ Wandering round the excellent museum, I was intrigued by the ferries leaving and\
  \ queried the destination. The receptionist proudly gestured to a flyer advertising\
  \ the former Japanese Naval Academy museum which happened to be open for a tour\
  \ that afternoon. Despite the rather vague directions- I knew this would be the\
  \ place where I would overcome my initial culture shock and either fall in love\
  \ with the country or put it down to experience and another stamp in the passport.\n\
  \nHis uniform pristine, he peered quizzically at me whilst I mimed walking and reading\
  \ a map. He nodded enthusiastically and pointed up the hill where I could just make\
  \ out some buildings and security checkpoint. Ten minutes later I was happily ensconced\
  \ while my new friend eagerly discovered probably the only tour brochure in English\
  \ for me and I was ushered around with my fellow visitors in the beautiful open\
  \ plazas and ceremonial rooms of this historical academy.\n\nWe had come to the\
  \ final stop on the tour- the museum. Eager to look inside I rushed on ahead before\
  \ pausing on the second step up to the building. The entire group was bowing before\
  \ the doors- and like a rude tourist I had rushed on ahead and probably offended\
  \ the entire group. Great. Passport stamp it is. \n\nBrushing past me, I decided\
  \ may as well finish the tour and trudged my way inside. Slowly matching up the\
  \ exhibits with my tour booklet I was soon immersed in the final letters of Kamikaze\
  \ pilots and the fascinating history of maritime Japan. As I came to the final exhibit,\
  \ my jaw dropped open- a lock of Horatio Nelson's hair. England and Japan had collided\
  \ and quirkiness prevailed and my love affair with Japan had begun."
