Text: "The last thing I expected: was to be immersed in a planet unknown, perhaps\
  \ Mars.\n\nIn the winter of 2018, I landed in Ladakh in Jammu & Kashmir for the\
  \ Zanskar Chadar trek. After having grown up at the foothills of The Himalayas,\
  \ this terrain was still unbearably unbelievable.  \n\nWe had 9 days to reach Naerek,\
  \ an old village sitting at 11100 ft. and get back, covering a ground of 70 km.\
  \ Did I say ground? I meant a frozen Zanskar river. \n\nIn the weeks before, I spent\
  \ hours preparing for low altitude breathing, researching gum boots versus crampons,\
  \ woolen socks versus jute socks; and now, it was time. However, what you cannot\
  \ prepare for in the normal world where rivers flow, is walking on ice. \n\nThin\
  \ ice. Sturdy ice. Brittle ice. Depth-revealing crystal clear ice. Fuzzy, snow-covered\
  \ ice. And when you fall, which you inevitably will, hopefully on your rucksack\
  \ and not on your joints, you get a 360 degree view of the rugged reddish brown\
  \ mountains and clear skies with only the silhouettes of mountains to remind you\
  \ that you are not in outer space.  \n\nEvery morning, we packed, we geared up,\
  \ and we treaded. Some fine rushed day, nature calls soon enough on the trail. And\
  \ I\u2019m empowered by the beautiful smell of wet earth of my own creation on a\
  \ high-altitude desert! It\u2019s the same as rainwater on dry soil in a sub-tropical\
  \ region. And we ensure we stay hydrated. On breaks, there\u2019s smoke-flavoured\
  \ water, warmed on stoves by the frozen riverside where our Sherpas tread with buckets.\
  \ They say \u201Ckhao, peeyo, ash karro\u201D \u2013 \u201CEat, drink, and be merry!\u201D\
  \ The cautious ones also add on oral rehydration salts. \n\nAnd caution manifests\
  \ in various forms in the strategies I build to cope with the challenges of slippery\
  \ strides. Only 10 breaths, one at a time, and no other focus in the world. Or saying\
  \ \u201CJuley\u201D, the local Ladakhi word for \u201CHello\u201D, muttered to every\
  \ passer-by in enthusiasm, fear, apprehension, or sighs of relief.\n\nOn reaching\
  \ Naerek and it\u2019s frozen waterfall and old dilapidated bridge, we flair our\
  \ country\u2019s flag on a national day. By now, we feel we have conquered the tricks.\
  \ I slide on ice, rather than resist it. I am unafraid of falling, not only on the\
  \ ice, but in the freezing water itself. \n\nUntil, I almost do. And it is then,\
  \ that I realize, we need this river to freeze. Estimates show that the Zanskar\
  \ will cease to freeze by 2020; calling for countries come together to counter climate\
  \ change. With that lingering, aching thought, I return to the capital city."
