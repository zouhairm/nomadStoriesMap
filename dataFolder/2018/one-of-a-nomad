Text: "The cold sharp rush of wind struck into my lungs, removing the remnants of\
  \ fatigue accumulated during last days. A rapid heartbeat and intermittent breathing\
  \ made me remember that I was at the altitude of almost 3000 meters above sea level,\
  \ so far from civilization \u2013 in a small Kyrgyzstan, lost among the mountains\
  \ of Central Asia. My new friend Azamat stopped the engine, we got out of his old\
  \ Soviet motorcycle \"Ural\" and very slowly headed to his yurta. Azamat does not\
  \ have toes on both feet \u2013 he got them frostbitten in previous October, when\
  \ heavy snowstorm began during the driving of livestock from the mountains to the\
  \ valley. His horse ran away because of snow and wind, his shoes were soaked and\
  \ torn.\n- Jailoo is rather a way of life, a constant movement from valleys to mountain\
  \ pastures and back is like a change of seasons for every Kyrgyz.\nWith calmness\
  \ and serenity of its landscapes, SonKul Lake was looking more like a scene from\
  \ a mystical film suitable for contemplation of being: low silver sky reflected\
  \ in the steel surface of the lake, bordered with a chain of emerald pastures and\
  \ a ring of cold hostile mountains. At that moment it seemed to me that Mother nature\
  \ conceived this place for not letting anyone to come in here, but once having done\
  \ that, never let him out. But for the Kyrgyz - the indigenous nomadic people of\
  \ this country - these conditions are not valid. Despite of this country\u2019s\
  \ 27 years of Independence, most of the country's population adheres to a nomadic\
  \ way of life. Like everyone at Sonkul Lake Azamat is Chaban \u2013 a Kyrgyz shepherd,\
  \ who grazes livestock on local pastures (Jailoo, as Kyrgyz call it) during summer\
  \ to back to their small villages in the valley by fall. Earlier that day Azamat\
  \ met me left alone without money on the road in one of the nearby villages. He\
  \ lives with his wife and three children in yurta on the shore of the lake and,\
  \ according to the tradition, invited me to be his guest. His modest, upholstered\
  \ in time-honored gray felt yurta, is filled with the smell of warmth and fresh\
  \ bread. His wife Nurgul offers me boorsok and tea, and three small children surrounded\
  \ me like an outlandish exhibit \u2013 the are curious, but afraid to approach me.\n\
  The first rays of the sun just pierced the hazy fog over the lake, barely touching\
  \ the ground\u2019s surface. While everyone was asleep, I left Azamat\u2019s yurta\
  \ to continue my trip. As a souvenir, I left him my boots. Now I know for sure -\
  \ wherever he is, his feet are always warm."
