Text: "The rusted taxi stopped abruptly, tossing me headfirst into the seat in front\
  \ of me. The driver, a middle aged Senegalese man, laughed heartily, cherishing\
  \ the sight of a toubob (foreigner) smacking himself against his car. Frazzled,\
  \ I glanced up, and saw that we had arrived. The makeshift garage lay before me,\
  \ a collection of what appeared to be decrepit, broken down cars whose drivers \
  \ were milling about, shouting things in Wolof I did not yet understand. Pausing\
  \ to ready myself for the chaos, I struggled with the taxi door before setting forth\
  \ on my first voyage home to my host family.\nThe taxi sped off as I gathered my\
  \ surroundings, my notebook from that day\u2019s language class equipped in hand\
  \ and ready for the incoming barrage of foreign stimuli, the rancid smell of trash\
  \ burning in  the distance, the Senegalese street dotted with oil stains and sand,\
  \ the women and men fluently reciting the language I wished to comprehend. Determined\
  \ to battle through, I pressured my way forward into the crowd, mumbling the Arabic\
  \ greeting that my new language adopted long ago. The crowd broke, and from the\
  \ masses stood one man, holding a soiled clipboard in one hand and countless CFA\
  \ in another. Seeing me approach, the man pivoted towards me and from his mouth\
  \ spewed French, one of the many by-products of French colonization. \n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t understand French,\u201D I stammer in broken Wolof, feeling for a moment overwhelmed\
  \ in a foreign city and language.\nTo my surprise, a huge smile spread across his\
  \ face as he replies, \u201CYou speak Wolof?\u201D\nThrilled that I was learning\
  \ his mother tongue, the garage record keeper took it upon himself to find me the\
  \ specific car would take me directly to my village, Keur Madaro, all the while\
  \ conversing slowly so I could possibly understand. He patiently allowed me to stumble\
  \ through sentence after sentence of telling that I was living with a host family\
  \ for 7 months, that I was from the U.S., and that I was teaching English in a secondary\
  \ school. He commented as well, informing me he had lived in the city of Thi\xE9\
  s in Senegal for his entire life and had always wanted to learn English but never\
  \ had time. Our impromptu English lesson began and ended shortly as he pointed to\
  \ my way home. Thanking him and promising to return soon, I rushed to board the\
  \ crumbling feat of engineering that was my ride, settling in the seven-seater just\
  \ as it skidded onto the street. As we pulled away, I glanced behind us and began\
  \ to grin, seeing my friend waving my car off."
