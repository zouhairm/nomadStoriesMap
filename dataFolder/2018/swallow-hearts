Text: "In the sense of things, waking up at 4:30 a.m. happens from time to time. Three\
  \ hours later, seeing thousands of swallows is also expected after asking Google\
  \ the right question. While getting wind of an old love makes the Cave of Swallows,\
  \ a distant tourist spot in Sain Luis Potosi, Mexico, truly special.\n\nMaria, a\
  \ Ukrainian girl married for almost a year to a Mexican guy David, and me are gently\
  \ thrown out of a bus at 6 a.m.. The gloomy morning over Aquismon is suddenly warm\
  \ for mid-February \u2013 as a somnolent smile on her face, \u201CEverything started\
  \ here.\u201D \n\nA bluish pinky serpentine is too tricky for large vehicles, so\
  \ we take a simply-designed passenger trailer with a couple of wooden planks inside.\
  \ Perfect elegance, though only two front seats guarantee a proper view.\n\nAs the\
  \ route brightens under a Copenhagen blue-primrose-pastel dawn sky, Maria\u2019\
  s story gains perspective. She came to Mexico as a volunteer five years ago \u2013\
  \ this cave called her. David joined that social project as a random global gathering.\
  \ It was love at the first sight: tempting, romantic, calling for hell-bent adventures.\
  \ He abducted this princess to Aquismon, striving to show her this reverie place.\
  \ \n\nIt was a nice beginning of the contradictory story. Just like the landscape\
  \ on the way, changing from breathtaking damp haze mountain views to boring fences\
  \ of bright-green thick bushes. All these contrasts ease the clambering.\n\nThe\
  \ Cave of Swallows is poor and put too safely away to attract tourists. Its only\
  \ amusements are coming down and nesting on a random stone near the pit \u2013 and\
  \ then, time drags on. An hour feels like three years: the span of their long-distance\
  \ relationship when feelings became too immense to carry. Like swallows, their delicate\
  \ souls needed the proper tone and the right words not to be scared.\n\nLife goes\
  \ in circles though, gently promising a new beginning to those who swallow its bitterness.\
  \ And this inception feels like ten minutes of birds\u2019 spiral choreography \u2013\
  \ up, down, zig-zag, faster, slower. Spreading the aroma of marine summer memories\
  \ over my head; reminding a na\xEFve amorousness.\n\nAnd when I look back at Maria,\
  \ the swallows, tattooed on her ankle, confirm my discovery. True love really waits.\n\
  \nThe wedding was in April; the season when swallows dance above butterflies and\
  \ yellow flowers. She carried a floral wreath, he wore a citrine tie. And their\
  \ identical tattoos showed the way, causing a butterfly effect in the lives of their\
  \ multinational guests."
