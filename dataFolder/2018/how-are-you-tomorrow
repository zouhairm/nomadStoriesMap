Text: "That\u2019s what our guides kept asking everyone on our way up Mount Batur\
  \ on Saturday morning. Seems like a strange thing to ask, right? Or perhaps you\
  \ assume it\u2019s a grammar mistake due to the language barrier. It took us approximately\
  \ five hours and 3,434 meters before we finally understood the joke. Here\u2019\
  s why.\n\nMount Batur is an active volcano and a very popular tourist destination\
  \ in Bali; so much so, in fact, that we practically had to ascend in a single file\
  \ line along with hundreds of other tourists who also wanted to reach the top before\
  \ sunrise. Add to this the fact that it was 2:00 am, and you can guess that while\
  \ I was excited to reach the top, I was also really not looking forward to the climb\
  \ to get there. We met our friends at a local cafe in the dark to wait for our taxi\
  \ and I promptly fell back asleep upon climbing inside. When we arrived an hour\
  \ later, I had two problems:\n\n1. I was half asleep.\n2. I was freezing cold. (Not\
  \ something I expected to EVER happen in Bali)!\n\nEnter our guides, Puluk and San,\
  \ to save the day.\n\n\u201CHello, how are you tomorrow?\u201D they asked us first\
  \ thing. Of course, we all giggled at this, not sure if they realized their mistake\
  \ or were just trying to be funny. Either way, it broke the ice and started our\
  \ \"day\" off on a happy note. If, that is, you can call 3:00 am \"day.\" This continued\
  \ to make us laugh all the way up and down the mountain, as we quickly came to anticipate\
  \ the question and the look on the people\u2019s faces every time someone new passed\
  \ by. \n\nWe finally made it up the mountain, huffing and puffing, and let me tell\
  \ you, it was worth it. The sunrise was breathtaking. A kind Indonesian woman in\
  \ a hut (yes, literally, a tiny hut with a door even I had to bend over to fit through)\
  \ made us hot chocolate and ramen. We sat in her hut by the fire and played guitar\
  \ and sang songs. It felt like camping, minus the marshmallows, and adding a few\
  \ monkeys.\n\nWhen we finally reached almost the end of the path at the bottom of\
  \ the mountain, one of the guides and I were walking a bit ahead of the group. Out\
  \ of curiosity, I finally turned to him and asked, \u201CWhy do you keep saying,\
  \ \u2018How are you tomorrow?\u2019\u201D\n\n\u201CBecause,\u201D he said, \u201C\
  it\u2019s funny. One time a tourist asked me in Bahasa, \u2018Apa kabar besok?\u2019\
  \ because he meant to ask \u2018How are you today?\u2019 but he really said \u2018\
  How are you tomorrow?\u2019 So now we always like to make people laugh when we say\
  \ that.\u201D\n\nShort answer: it makes people happy. So, friends, I ask you: How\
  \ are you tomorrow?"
