Text: "There is a time, a place, a moment, an instinct when you just know what is\
  \ right. It is a universal force.\_ Its feeling is incredible and unpredictably\
  \ strong. It is here. This place of epiphanic bliss is unbound by walls, space,\
  \ time or name; it is an experience. How do I explain?\n\nThe chattering of servants\
  \ waxed and waned behind the rhythmic\_cricket-cricket\_hymn of kings. Delicate\
  \ breaths spread the seductive scent of jasmine, the real queen of the night. I\
  \ glanced at my wrist to see the diamonds on the watch dial glistening\_in\_the\
  \ moonlight\u2014exactly eleven o\u2019clock.\_The temple gardens were desolate\
  \ except for the few who strolled by once or twice before eventually settling in\
  \ their quarters. In between, messengers called for me, but they too returned to\
  \ the halls upon my refusal.\_Finally, I was alone\u2026almost. I shared company\
  \ with the native watchman who sat on duty outside in the comfort of a hypnotic,\
  \ crackling fire. What started as an unbelieving look, I watched his curiosity turn\
  \ into defeated acceptance of the young roamer swaying like an angel from the heavens\
  \ on the ethereal\_swing under the starry sky. A crystal white sari and pearls draped\
  \ the curve of her bare neck. Soft winds pierced delicate fibers of her rosy skin\
  \ and gently kissed her long black hair as she continued to oscillate deep in meditation.\n\
  \nI am she. \n\nJourneying through the eternal labyrinths of my\_mind, I am awed\
  \ with\_infinite\_potential. Conflicting waves of emotions collide as one in an\
  \ ocean of space, eventually breaking to\_spread powerful, harmonic energy. Suddenly,\
  \ I am empowered by nature with gifts of profound understanding. Amid tumultuous\
  \ emotions, I reach euphoric mental stillness where I am most content. I have become\
  \ the garden, the jasmine, the air, and all that is ethereal of the night. It exists\
  \ within me. I am its master as much as it is mine.\n\nIs this what they call transcendence?\
  \ Magnificent.  \n\nMeditating on a garden swing in a temple somewhere in Gujarat,\
  \ India, transcendence is the last experience I expected. God bless this breathtaking\
  \ land of colors, culture, and Karma Sutra!"
