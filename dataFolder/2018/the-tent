Text: "When we decided to spend two weeks backpacking through the Rocky Mountains,\
  \ I don't think either of us were prepared to spend two weeks living in a tent not\
  \ much bigger than a baby's crib. \n\nMy best friend Becky and I left Halifax on\
  \ July 20th, 2017. We arrived at the Calgary airport late that night. Since we hadn't\
  \ prepared any accommodations, we slept in the airport. I slept like a baby. Becky\
  \ didn't. I awoke in the morning to a very frazzled looking Becky. While I had slept\
  \ through the night, she had been willing herself not to fall asleep in this strange\
  \ new place. \n\nWe hadn't even been in Calgary for a full day before realizing\
  \ that we had packed way too much stuff. Foolishly, we decided to ditch our foam\
  \ sleeping pads at the airport to make our bags easier to carry. \n\nWe arrived\
  \ in Lake Louise that evening. After setting up our tent, we decided to check out\
  \ the village. \n\nBy the time night fell we had filled our bellies with some awful\
  \ freeze-dried food and put on what we thought would be enough layers. No one told\
  \ us how cold nights in Lake Louise could get. \n\nOur first night in Lake Louise\
  \ was uncomfortable, to say the least. We woke several times through the night,\
  \ trying to readjust ourselves so the gravel surface where we had been instructed\
  \ to put our tent would stop assaulting our hips while I slept. \n\nWhen we woke\
  \ up in the morning, covered in bruises from the gravel that lay beneath us while\
  \ we slept, we vowed never to leave our sleeping pads at the airport again. \n\n\
  The next five nights were much the same. Becky and I tossed and turned every night.\
  \ We tried to use clothes as a makeshift mattress, but our near constant movements\
  \ kept pushing them to the edges of the tent. \n\nBy the third night, we were both\
  \ exhausted and getting testy. \n\nEvery morning we woke up, took some ibuprofen\
  \ to soothe our bruised and aching legs, ate oatmeal for breakfast and headed off\
  \ to explore the spectacular views that Lake Louise and the Rocky Mountains had\
  \ to offer.\n\nWe only stayed in Lake Louise for five days before packing up to\
  \ go to the Banff Townsite. We stayed in the national park campgrounds there too.\
  \ To our dismay, the campsites were also graveled. \n\nWe had a blast exploring\
  \ the Rocky Mountains, but by the time our last day rolled around, we were both\
  \ ready to land in Halifax."
