Text: "After one week in Arequipa. After flying with the condors in Colca Canyon.\
  \ After getting on my knees at the Atacama desert, in Salar the Tara. After crying\
  \ for so many blessings, I finally booked my trip to Lima, in order to catch my\
  \ flight to Bogota. \nI left Arequipa by bus at 2 p.m. I would arrive to the capital\
  \ 14 hours later. The bus ticket included a light dinner, movies and amazing landscapes.\
  \ The day was smiling at me and within me. \nAfter contemplating the sunset, I had\
  \ the opportunity to watch a documentary about Cantiflas, a Mexican actor that made\
  \ me laugh during my childhood. The moon was our guide with its porous light, rescuing\
  \ me from the ninth seat. \nI was daydreaming when the busboy, with a straight red\
  \ tie, handed out bingo cards to those who wanted to play the night's game: bingo,\
  \ itself. The winning prize was another bus trip with Cruz del Sur, the bus company.\
  \ Although I was about to leave Peru, I gladly accepted the red card. I noticed\
  \ the shadow of an ironic smile. I was deeply curious.\nThe man in the seat next\
  \ to mine helped me understand some of the local expressions from the beginning.\
  \ Now and then, the young but very professional busboy enthusiastically asked questions\
  \ just like in a trivial pursuit contest. Each time, I raised my arm as quickly\
  \ as I could. I was playing to win! I saw myself looking at the red card hoping\
  \ to hear my numbers so I could shout 'line'! Although, I have to say, I was craving\
  \ to shout bingo!\nThe busboy was really committed to his role and was always motivating\
  \ the contestants with words of true enthusiasm. He was a great animator.\nThe bus\
  \ journey reached its climax, when the uniformed boy announced to the young lady\
  \ who won bingo, Lilly, that she had to prove her worth for the prize.\nIt was not\
  \ enough to have full house; Lilly had to prove her willingness to travel with Cruz\
  \ del Sur along that wonderful country. The audience applauded. The presenter announced:-\
  \ \"Lilly, you have to sing a song of your choice\". The whole crowd whistled with\
  \ enjoyment.\nThe Peruvian girl quickly cleared her throat and started singing a\
  \ song out of tune. Everyone on the bus joined in, and so she showed that yes, she\
  \ was worthy of the victory and the respective prize.\nI also won Bingo! And multiple\
  \ times. I laughed so much and had so much fun, that I do agree with the publicity\
  \ of Cruz del Sur: el placer de viajar en bus (the pleasure of traveling by bus)."
