Text: "\u201CNo, this is not my home.\u201D she answered with a giggle. Climbing the\
  \ steps separating us, she took my hand saying, \u201CCome let me show you my home.\u201D\
  \ \nHer name was Dinah and yes, her mum was aware she was out so early picking flowers.\
  \ I had come out at dawn to take in the pure island air when I saw the little girl\
  \ with the golden hair that rested on her shoulders bent over the daises in front.\n\
  \ \nIt was my first morning at Solomon Islands. After I quit my job in a fit of\
  \ fatigue-induced rage, I needed to travel. My vacation rental in the capital Honiara\
  \ was a dainty house that reminded me of the cottages described in the books I read\
  \ as a child. Surrounded by trees, its white windows looked like curious little\
  \ eyes from the outside. The garden of hydrangeas and daises in bloom on the right\
  \ side of the house lent it a quaintness that helped me relax.\n \nSolomon Islands\
  \ had been a dream travel destination for me for the longest time. Pictures of its\
  \ raw, untouched beauty were often my elixir on those dreadful days at work. Its\
  \ WWII history, scuba diving, and the Pidgin English spoken by the people were major\
  \ points of attraction for me. \n \n \n\n \nDinah, still holding my hand led me\
  \ down the street, three houses later and we were at her home. It was a white bungalow\
  \ with ornamental thatch roofing and the greenest lawn I\u2019d ever seen.\n\n \n\
  \nThe smell of coffee wafted through the air as we got closer to the front door.\
  \ The door opened and a friendly looking woman with her hair wrapped in a scarf\
  \ stepped out and asked, \u201CDinah, who is your new friend?\u201D \n\u201CTracy.\u201D\
  \ I said as I held out my hand for a hand shake. She pulled me in for a big hug\
  \ instead and said, \u201CPatricia, Dinah\u2019s mum.\u201D\nOnce inside, she offered\
  \ me coffee. Their warmth and friendliness quickly put me at ease. She soon placed\
  \ in front of me a cup of coffee. \n \nDinah and her mum were eager to share their\
  \ home, culture and history with me as they told me about the Islands, the best\
  \ places to visit to get an authentic feel of their culture, and taught me their\
  \ Pidgin English. I learnt \u201Cto visit\u201D was \u201Cvisitim\u201D and \u201C\
  when?\u201D or \u201Cat what time?\u201D was \u201Cwataem\u201D.\nPatricia, a native\
  \ of the Island had worked as an attorney in Fiji for ten years. After her divorce\
  \ two years ago, she decided to change her life and move back home. She now ran\
  \ a tour company.\n \n\nAs she shared with me her decision to pare down her life\
  \ and move back home, the haze lifted and I knew what I was going to do once my\
  \ holiday was over."
