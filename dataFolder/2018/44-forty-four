Text: "I decided to spend my birthday in a wonderful place \u2013 in Greek Meteora\
  \ Mountains. My wife and me arrived here for a couple of days. So we are making\
  \ a leisurely stroll across the mountains, visiting monasteries, and just enjoying\
  \ the beauty of the local landscapes.\nHowever, our walk turned to be much longer\
  \ than we thought it would be. As soon as we set off, the whirl of my thoughts began\
  \ to whizz by at a frantic pace, and the red dog of my memories was trying to find\
  \ ways of catching up.\nThese memories are dating back to the childhood. I see the\
  \ picture of a mother feeding her six-year-old boy suddenly distracted, having forgotten\
  \ about a spoon of delicious apple puree. Is he looking at their dad, who is taking\
  \ a shot?\nIn just a few months after this scene, my dad will leave his family,\
  \ his wife and three children, and will gradually get dissolved in space.\nTravels,\
  \ endless movement forward... Usually it turns out to be just a gyre circulation.\
  \ And those monks who escaped from failures and regrets of worldly existence, having\
  \ settled here once, they are now serving as museum supervisors, they are stuck\
  \ between heaven and earth, being unable to make a single step forward. The light\
  \ of candles cannot substitute the sunshine, and in the dark cells it can only remind\
  \ of hundreds of abandoned human lives immured under these gray stones.\nHere, in\
  \ this place, a human being was completely defeated. The only teacher who still\
  \ stays in Meteora is the divine nature. She is uttering her soft but diligent commandments\
  \ at each and every step.\nThe red dog was not lagging behind. He brought me about\
  \ to recollect the haste and hesitations, the small wins that no one remembers anymore,\
  \ about numerous fails that no one cares about, the deaths of the close people,\
  \ and unborn children. However, again and again, the image of a rosy cheeks boy\
  \ emerged from the depths of my memory, a boy who is now a gray-haired man, yet,\
  \ his efforts to create anything in his life seemed to have been for naught...\n\
  I looked around and it\u2019s only now I notice that our four-legged follower has\
  \ disappeared.\nThe trip was coming to an end. Back we came quickly, without any\
  \ vain and idle chatters, without looking back at yesterday, and being glad that\
  \ the red dog has loitered somewhere while the pleasant twilight that gradually\
  \ settled around.\nAnd my advice to you: when you meet the red dog, do not feed\
  \ it, because your memories will pursue you, they will disturb you, they will strangulate\
  \ your wings."
