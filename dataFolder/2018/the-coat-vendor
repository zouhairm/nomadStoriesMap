Text: "Strokes of tangerine and red filled the sky, as I gazed through the window\
  \ of a bus that was to take me to Plitvice National Park, in Croatia. It was a frosty\
  \ morning, and I watched my breath make little clouds on the window that temporarily\
  \ obstructed my view of the sunrise. I snuggled tighter into the quilted, bomber\
  \ jacket I had recently purchased. Still a little cold, I suddenly remembered my\
  \ new red scarf. As I pulled it out I closed my eyes, remembering how they came\
  \ to me.\n\nThe coat vendor, was an older man in his late sixties. He was tall and\
  \ lean, with a bright bald head on which he wore a rolled up red cap, which exposed\
  \ his large rounded ears. His tangly black and grey beard was a bit unruly, and\
  \ his mustache was so that I could just decipher a faint smirk on his lips. Though\
  \ we shared no common language, we never struggled to communicate. I tried on several\
  \ jackets from his little booth. He helped me into each one, and then dutifully\
  \ held up a mirror for me scan my appearance. He would give me a thumbs up, and\
  \ then nod emphatically while I inspected my reflection. Coat after coat, his movements\
  \ remained jovial and he continued to chat to me in Croatian. When he helped me\
  \ into the bomber jacket, his demeanor became serious, and he lowered his chin to\
  \ match my gaze. He excitedly murmured to himself, then he held up the mirror, eyes\
  \ wide in anticipation. I twirled around, then finally returned his thumbs up in\
  \ agreement. This coat was the one. He clapped, and wrote a price down for me on\
  \ a scrap piece of paper. After not enough haggling, we settled on a number. Thanking\
  \ him, I mentioned I was headed to Plitvice.\n\u201CPLITVICE?!\u201D he exclaimed.\
  \ \u201CPlitvice!\u201D He began rummaging around in the old fashioned trunk by\
  \ our feet. He whirled, brandishing a ruffly red knitted thing and I tilted my head\
  \ in confusion. He thrust it into my hands saying, \u201CPlitvice! Plitvice!\u201D\
  \ and then motioned for me to wrap it around my neck. Realizing it was a scarf,\
  \ I hesitatingly added it to my ensemble. He held up his hands gesturing back and\
  \ forth between us as if to say, \u201Cfrom me to you.\u201D He smiled wider still,\
  \ then nodded his head and motioned goodbye. We hugged and I departed.\n\nThe scarf\
  \ wasn't beautiful but I loved what it was. I hoped that it would serve as a reminder\
  \ for adventures to come, that the landmarks, the photographs, and the perfect shot\u2014\
  they only portray the most obvious realm. This human encounter, was a portal that\
  \ transported me to the real Croatia."
