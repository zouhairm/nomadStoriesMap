Text: "I am not good at travelling. At least, I have never been.  My love story with\
  \ exploding the world originates in 2010 when I was carrying all hardships of teenager\u2019\
  s life. I was fifteen years old, I have never been abroad before and I had a chance\
  \ to go to Germany for an exchange. Oh, I was as excited as it is possible for a\
  \ girl going to the birthplace of \u201CTokio Hotel\u201D (I had a crush for this\
  \ German group). \nAfter I had heroically survived my first flight, my dreams were\
  \ about to come true.  Guess what? They didn\u2019t.  My acquaintance with Europe\
  \ resembled a bad first teenage kiss. Firstly, the language barrier. Why didn\u2019\
  t anyone tell me about it? I could not explain to the family members I was living\
  \ with I needed a shower. Pupils of the German school were different, all people\
  \ seemed for me aliens from another planet. It terrified me so much! While other\
  \ guys from Russia were making local connection I could only think about going home\
  \ to my warm bed. A lot of time has passed but I still say that I am not enthusiastic\
  \ about Germany. In fact, I know I just did not want to see the beautiful things\
  \ this country has to offer. \nWell, later I visited Spain twice, Prague, Poland,\
  \ again Germany but it was always in the wrong way. Surely, I have always had a\
  \ lot of fun thanks to my travel friends but I have never really interested in knowing\
  \ any country or city. No some special things for me to memorize except my tooth\
  \ bracket that was tragically lost in Port Aventura. Things that embody the culture\
  \ of the country. \nTherefore, I clearly defined myself as a person completely satisfied\
  \ with life in Siberian suburb. Everything changed last year. My Russian friends\
  \ were getting a master\u2019s degree in Paris and I had a surprise visit for them.\
  \ Because of their hard studying, mostly I was left to myself and it turned my world\
  \ around. No excursions with a Russian badly joking guide, no neighbors in the bus\
  \ talking about beggars and smelly immigrants. Just Paris and me. That is how I\
  \ felt in love with travelling. Begin in a small cafe without tourists but with\
  \ dressed Parisians drink wine at ten in the morning. Walk in the park that is not\
  \ even on the map and feed the ducks. Then two hours for listening to a street musician\
  \ on the Champs Elysees. Feel as an Esmeralda on the roof of the Notre Dame de Paris.\
  \ Cancel drugs from a street vendor and see the beauty of Paris at night in the\
  \ Louvre\u2019s courtyards. Be alone in the middle of another country and feel breathtakingly\
  \ about it."
