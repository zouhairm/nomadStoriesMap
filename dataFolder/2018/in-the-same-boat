Text: "The first day that I gave Tashome the oars, he had no idea what he was doing.\n\
  I had no idea what I was doing either. I mean, I know how to row a boat. I had no\
  \ idea what I was doing in Africa. \nAt the end of the summer rafting season in\
  \ Northern California, a good friend from work told me about a river in Ethiopia,\
  \ the Blue Nile. A company called Sierra Rios was doing the 7th descent in November,\
  \ a month-long expedition on a river that would soon be flooded by the Great Ethiopian\
  \ Renaissance Dam. Before I knew it I was landing in Addis Ababa with a bag full\
  \ of gear, barely ready for what Africa was about to teach me.\nMost Ethiopians\
  \ don't see the Blue Nile unless they live close enough to its edge. Those nearby\
  \ bring their cattle to drink, bathe, fill their plastic buckets with coffee-colored\
  \ water.\nThey looked at us like we were from another planet.\nWe had two locals\
  \ in our company, a translator and a guard. Bereket Gebreyes did his best to include\
  \ Tashome, translating conversations around the campfire. But there were days when\
  \ Tashome rode along without him, when we relied on the only thing we had in common:\
  \ we were in the same boat.\nI didn't speak Amharic and Tashome didn't speak English,\
  \ but he learned fast. I admit I wasn't sure about giving him the oars in rapids\
  \ at first, but he was no more clumsy than I was when I began. The oars slammed\
  \ up and down in the locks, his arms shook, raised too high, pulled too hard. We\
  \ mimed and we gestured and he learned how to push and how to pull. He could say\
  \ \"yes\" and \"okay\" and he learned how to rig his assault rifle right on the\
  \ dry box. And, slowly, he learned how to row. \nWe came around a bend in the river\
  \ to a class II bend rapid and Tashome had the oars. I looked at him. My friend\
  \ offered him a thumbs up, Tashome nodded \"yes,\" and I made sure everything was\
  \ strapped down. \nWatching Tashome row a class II rapid was more fun than rowing\
  \ the bigger ones. He was smiling, saying \"yes yes yes\" the whole way down. And\
  \ while I was thinking \"please don't hit the wall\" the entire time, I was smiling\
  \ too. \nGetting to shore later, Bereket and some of the others congratulated Tashome.\
  \ \n\"I wasn't sure, but we gave him the thumbs up and he said yes,\" I said. \n\
  \"Oh, he will always do that,\" said Bereket. \"If you do thumbs up he will thumbs\
  \ up or say yes, always. He doesn't really know what it means.\" \nTashome officially\
  \ has the most river miles on the Blue Nile in Ethiopia, he completed three full\
  \ descents with Sierra Rios."
