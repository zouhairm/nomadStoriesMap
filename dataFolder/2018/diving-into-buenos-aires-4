Text: "\u201CIf he finds out you\u2019re a foreigner, you can get in trouble\u201D\
  \ was one of the first warnings I received before ordering a cab in Buenos Aires.\
  \ \u201CI would like to go to Callao\u201D, I told the driver in Spanish while getting\
  \ into the car. \u201CWhere??\u201D he replied. After repeating it a couple of times\
  \ he finally understood. \u201COh you meant \u2018Cajjao\u2019!! Where\u2019re you\
  \ from?\u201D\nDamn. I had not spent 2 minutes in it and he already knew I wasn\u2019\
  t from Argentina. For anyone familiar with the Spanish pronunciation, the \u2018\
  ll\u2019 can greatly vary from country to country. I had said it like a Spaniard.\
  \ But here, it can be pronounced anything from \u201Cj\u201D to \u201Csh\u201D.\n\
  Still, this piece of advice echoed a main concern locals have in big cities: insecurity.\n\
  \u201CHow did you get back\nhome yesterday night? Texted me once an Argentinian\
  \ friend.\nBy train \nAt what time?\nAt what time?\nAt what time?\n            \
  \                                        \n                                    \
  \                                At 10pm! \n                                   \
  \                   Is it OK \u201CDaddy\u201D?\nYou\u2019re crazy! Give me\nyour\
  \ mother\u2019s phone.\nI\u2019m gonna tell her.\u201D\nAlbeit half joking, his\
  \ reaction was one of the many I faced during my stay. \nFrom this fear, incongruous\
  \ jobs emerged as well, like the cuida coche. As their title suggests, they will\
  \ be looking after your car while parked in the street. Whether you like it or not.\
  \ I was always intrigued by these people who expected to be paid for an unwanted\
  \ favor, until I got to hear from one of them. It was one of these hot summer nights,\
  \ when you could tell from the heavy air that a storm was coming up. \"Don\u2019\
  t know if I\u2019m gonna stay here much longer.\u201D He admitted, his hands scrunching\
  \ the bills of pesos I had just given him. Even after working fifteen hours a day,\
  \ he only made $350 a month. \u201CI have a handicapped daughter and with the new\
  \ benefit cuts passed by the government, I can barely make ends meet now.\u201D\
  \ Speechless, I felt helpless in front of this man, who was simply grateful for\
  \ having found someone he could share his burden with, for a moment.\nBut the stories\
  \ don\u2019t end up here. The same taxi driver made a stop to buy me what he considered\
  \ to be the best \u201Calfajor (cookie) in town\u201D. The same friend who texted\
  \ me, drove me back home the following day so that I wouldn\u2019t have to take\
  \ the train. \nYes, Argentinians live with a constant sword of Damocles hanging\
  \ over\_their heads but  I felt that their sense of solidarity and sharing largely\
  \ make up for it."
