Text: "I was sixteen years old when I found myself accomplishing what most sixteen\
  \ year olds hope to. I got away from home for a while, In fact I found myself halfway\
  \ across the planet with no expectations other than to enjoy and take in the views.\
  \ \nComing from a very crime ridden community my parents always wanted me to do\
  \ extracurricular activities, so I would just kind of stumble into them. I had signed\
  \ up for choir class after seeing my crush sign up for it once, but that summer\
  \ she had switched schools and I was stuck singing for a year while beatboxing with\
  \ my friends in the corner during lessons. In the same way I took to French club,\
  \ I had my reasons, I had two linguistic choices French and Spanish and being born\
  \ Mexican, I knew Spanish, so I went with French club to try to broaden my anthropological\
  \ spectrum. The fact that I could legally drink there and go to clubs didn't hurt\
  \ either. \nSo here I was without any real preconception of this country, it was\
  \ dusk and we were driving to the Latin quarter from the airport, the sun was setting\
  \ against these foreign yet familiar suburbs, crafted with such heart and soul that\
  \ you can feel this tangible ancient romanticism in the air and by the time I set\
  \ foot in Paris, every murky puddle became sacred. \nI started at the Louvre, which\
  \ is a fascinating name for a museum, it's etymology is a mystery, some people speculate\
  \ that it actually means wolf, which is what I felt like on this trip. This Native\
  \ American creature wondering wild and free, I fought my way past a group of Japanese\
  \ tourists to look at \"la jaconde\" or \"Mona Lisa\" as she is known stateside,\
  \ the enigmatic haunting masterpiece that has left the world at the mercy of it's\
  \ charm for ages, she smirked. Walking through those gold plated halls I felt my\
  \ world shift, I saw majesty and glory encapsulated and as I left the museum and\
  \ looked out at the streets I saw no distinction. \nParis was a dream I didn't want\
  \ to wake up from. I had fallen in love. The next day we drove towards the south\
  \ of France and stopped at Leonardo Davinci's grave atop a quaint French village.\
  \ Ironically I felt no sadness, I felt this strange fascination with how a man can\
  \ be gone and yet so alive to so many people through the work he had left behind.\
  \ I leaned down and I thanked him. France felt like home to me, it brought the man\
  \ out of me, I even had the courage to ask a girl out on a date for the first time.\
  \ All I can remember thinking was that I'd always wanted to be in love."
