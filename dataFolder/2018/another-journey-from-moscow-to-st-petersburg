Text: "\u201CThis is exactly the book we need right now\u201D - I thought to myself,\
  \ as we were standing still on a train, somewhere around Dno. A town in Pskov Oblast,\
  \ between nowhere and obscurity, with a name, that translates as \u201Cbottom\u201D\
  . One of my companions in the second-class compartment of the train brought \xAB\
  \ All the Maya's predictions. 2012: Apocalypse\xBB. It seemed that this man in the\
  \ grey baggy sweater had unconsciously packed the most inappropriate book you can\
  \ imagine having at that moment. Standing on the tracks, we looked at each other\
  \ bewildered, hoping to get more explanations about what happened.\nIt would be\
  \ with a ten-hour delay, that we arrived in St Petersburg, where I was planning\
  \ to spend a long weekend with my friends. When I was buying my tickets, a young\
  \ woman with a bright smile persistently persuaded me to save money on the \u201C\
  Nevsky Express\u201D and instead take the next train, that would arrive 4 hours\
  \ later than the high-speed train, but would be more comfortable and I could make\
  \ a quick transfer to the subway instead of freezing outside while trying to catch\
  \ a cab. She was convincing and I took the later train.\nWhile traversing the 700\
  \ km distance between the political and cultural capitals of Russia, the eye sometimes\
  \ catches yellowish train stations. However, most of the ride you typically see\
  \ desolated grey fields, which appeared even dimmer this November. Peering through\
  \ cheap polyester curtains I got the feeling the last visitors these places had\
  \ seen, were riding on heavily-loaded horses a century ago, while trying to escape\
  \ the hunger and anguish or as Russians call it toska.\nFor a long time, the train\
  \ just stood still. Usually, the stops are very short in the rural areas with a\
  \ tiny population.\n-Where are we? - I asked the 30something man with the Apocalypse\
  \ book.\n-Somewhere not far from Tver, but we were supposed to cross this area hours\
  \ ago \u2013 he answered while sipping his tea on the upper bunk bed.\nI grabbed\
  \ my old Sony Ericsson and saw dozens of missed calls and several messages. At that\
  \ moment, I knew something had happened. Back then, smartphones were still a luxury\
  \ for many and WiFi connection outside of buildings was rare. I dialed my father.\
  \ \u201CYou know, there has been an explosion on the Nevsky Express and 28 people\
  \ died. Are you alright?\u201D I felt the bottom drop out underneath my feet. It\
  \ was November 27, 2009, the day of a terror attack on the high-speed train I was\
  \ supposed to be on it, but for a young woman with a bright smile."
