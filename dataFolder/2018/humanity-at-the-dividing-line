Text: "The last thing I expected was to be held at gun point by a North Korean soldier\
  \ dressed in khakhi green in the middle of the Yalu River. I\u2019m sitting in a\
  \ long, narrow wooden boat with eleven frightened teachers, the captain and tour\
  \ guide. The space is confined; I am seated knee-to-knee with Anna in front of me,\
  \ I can feel the warm air from Ben\u2019s exhale on my left cheek and I can feel\
  \ Oonagh\u2019s terror through her grip of my right arm.  I am curious about what\
  \ is going to happen next. \nOur boat is in a remote part of the Yalu River, which\
  \ constitutes the dividing line between China and North Korea.  There are three\
  \ North Korean soldiers, with guns in their hand, walking purposely towards us,\
  \ away from the tall wired fence they are guarding. They start running through the\
  \ tall gold grass shouting something in a language that I do not understand. The\
  \ tour guide calmly says \u201CStop taking photos and put your phones away.\u2019\
  \ The soldiers stop and there\u2019s an eerie silence. A moment that speaks volumes.\
  \ They are looking at us intensely. I am looking at them with curiosity and fear.\
  \ I have a thought \u201CAre you going to shoot us for taking photos?\u201D \u201C\
  Are we going to be sold?\u201D Our tour guide interrupts the silence \u201CGive\
  \ me 5 Yuan\u201D. We all fiddle in our confined space and give him 5 Yuan. He waves\
  \ it at the North Korean soldiers while walking off the boat and hands the money\
  \ to a solder. We all watch in anticipation. Our tour guide walks back towards the\
  \ boat, the soldiers walk back to their guard posts and I release my breath. \n\
  We continue to drift along the Yalu River. North Korea on my left looks baron, while\
  \ on my right the Chinese city of Dandong is bustling with people who have travelled\
  \ from as far as South Korea to get a peak into North Korea. That was our motivation\
  \ of coming to Dandong. We hiked the easternmost stretch of the Great Wall, Hushan\
  \ Changcheng, to see what we could of North Korea. The view from atop spoke volumes\
  \ about the contrast between the two countries. Across the Yalu River, I saw a desolate\
  \ stretch of land with no life or soul. \nWe stop again. Two soldiers, walk out\
  \ of the bushes toward our boat. One steps on to our boat. He has the look of a\
  \ youthful teenager with the resolve of man at war. His face is dirty and his cheeks\
  \ are red-blushed from the sun. He doesn\u2019t look a day over 18. The tour guide\
  \ asks \u201CDo you have any food?\u201D I stand up and give him a baguette. He\
  \ shakes my hand with gratitude and humility. I am a mixture of awe and sadness."
