Text: "\u201CI\u2019m sitting on the roof!\u201D I declared when the truck came. \n\
  \nMy friends and I had taken horse rides and camped out in the desert near Real\
  \ De Catorce the night before. This truck was our ride back into town. Sitting on\
  \ the rooftop of a public truck in the open mountains like a local was exciting\
  \ to me but sometimes reality doesn\u2019t match expectations. And it can be much\
  \ more dangerous. \n\nIt started out with a fun and breezy ride through the forest.\
  \ Then the trees started to thin out, giving way to the scrublands and the steep,\
  \ narrow road of the mountain. Guardrails hadn\u2019t mattered when we were horse\
  \ riding. Now that the truck had to pass through the same road, I was suddenly very\
  \ aware if its absence.\n\nThe truck seesawed as it drove on the uneven rocky path\
  \ and my knuckles turned white as I gripped its safety railing. I looked over at\
  \ my friend Chris, who was seated opposite. He could see what little space there\
  \ was between the tires and the cliff\u2019s edge. \u201DJust consider yourself\
  \ lucky you\u2019re on that side.\u201D he told me. I did. \n\nThe engine groaned\
  \ in protest and I wondered if we will make it to town. I wondered if my hands could\
  \ make it. The truck stopped and I gratefully flexed my cramped hands. I peeked\
  \ below and a schoolboy was entering the front cab. He gave me a smile and I smiled\
  \ back. Just another trip to school with crazy tourists for him, I guess.\n\nThe\
  \ truck continued up the mountain as people got in and out but there were always\
  \ at least 12 of us at a time in that small truck. At one stop, Chris tugged my\
  \ elbow and signaled me to look below. I stretched myself and saw a woman standing\
  \ on the back steps of the truck, clutching to the railings with one hand and a\
  \ baby in her other arm. Her toddler was sharing the step with her.\n\nBefore I\
  \ could say anything, the truck moved on with a sharp jolt. Chris and I shared a\
  \ look of horror. At the next stop, some people got off, so this woman was able\
  \ to sit in the cab with her children. We sighed with relief.\n\nWe arrived in town\
  \ an hour and a half later. I was happy we made it and was honestly glad the ride\
  \ was over. I had wanted an authentic local experience and that was exactly what\
  \ I got. \n\nAs outsiders, we tend look at one-time local experiences as novelty\
  \ but we forget sometimes that it\u2019s daily reality for others. I don\u2019t\
  \ regret the terrifying ride but I am more respectful of it with the knowledge that\
  \ some people risk their lives everyday in doing daily activities that we usually\
  \ do in safety."
