Text: "I traveled a lot when I worked for a major commercial airlines. When I did,\
  \ I traveled mostly with friends, family member, or with my ex-husband. After my\
  \ divorce, I've decided that I would start traveling more to places I haven't traveled\
  \ to before, alone. I must say, I am really loving this travel solo. I started traveling\
  \ alone last year and it felt so liberating. This year, I started my year with a\
  \ bang and traveled recently to Costa Rica. It's one of the places I've always wanted\
  \ to visit. I must say, the local people are genuinely friendly and helpful. Of\
  \ course, being fluent in Spanish helps a lot too when traveling to Spanis-speaking\
  \ countries. I find it easy to make a local connection with that universal non-verbal\
  \ communication, a smile, an honest-to-goodness, genuine smile. Making that first\
  \ eye contact with a smile on your face makes things easier, in any country you\
  \ visit. That smile on your face breaks the ice and the awkwardness, even at the\
  \ crack of dawn. I can attest to this during my trip to Costa Rica. When the plane\
  \ landed in San Jose at 4:00 am and deplaned, I glanced at one of the airport employees\
  \ and gave them a quick smile. They smiled back and noticed their face lit up. Most\
  \ people, upon arriving at an airport in a foreign country, are irritable and grouchy.\
  \ I on the other hand, is very happy that we landed and excited for the adventure\
  \ that awaits me. \nTo me, making a local connection with the street vendor, a store\
  \ owner, a server from a local restaurant, a taxi driver, or even your tour guide\
  \ makes a big difference when traveling to a foreign country. I make it a point\
  \ to ask for their name followed by a self-introduction, and address them with their\
  \ name respectfully while making an eye contact. By doing so, this gives you the\
  \ 'in' to the local happenings, and recommendations that only the locals know about.\
  \ One good example is when I was walking to the bus stop to go to the beach, I recognize\
  \ the same taxi driver who drove me from the bus terminal the day before to my place\
  \ of lodging, parked near the bus stop. So, I waved and smiled at him and he recognized\
  \ me. Since he drove me to my destination the day before, he gave a discount on\
  \ the taxi fare, not  to mention, recommended one of his friends who is a tour guide\
  \ at Parque Nacional in Manuel Antonio. I told him that I am traveling on a budget.\
  \ Instead of paying the standard $75 for a private tour, I ended up paying $25 for\
  \ my private tour. I am one happy traveler. Smile!"
