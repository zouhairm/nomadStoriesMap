Text: "It was the city of heartbreak and reconstruction, lost and found. I was struggling\
  \ with some dashed hopes when I found myself in Porto, Portugal, but not through\
  \ any fault of the city\u2019s own. As I wandered the streets that first day, the\
  \ street musicians must have had some inkling of my heartbreak, as they curiously\
  \ played only tragic \u201980s love ballads. Still, the streets were full of anticipation\
  \ for the evening\u2019s events: it was Festa de S\xE3o Jo\xE3o do Porto. \n\nThere\
  \ is nothing quite like getting repeatedly bopped on the head with soft plastic\
  \ hammers or long-stemmed garlic flowers, and like being among thousands of people\
  \ launching lanterns into the sky whilst wondering in unison if the beacons will\
  \ make it or set a building or crowd on fire, then watching a firework display from\
  \ the Dom Lu\xEDs I Bridge by Eiffel. But this is not about the festival. Rather,\
  \ it\u2019s about the date I had the day after. \n\nI connected with him through\
  \ one of those dating apps\u2014a first for me. He offered a tour, and what better\
  \ way is there to get to know a city but from a local? We met in a park near where\
  \ I was staying, both of us still blurry-eyed from the day before. We walked toward\
  \ the city center as he pointed out things I never would have noticed, like how\
  \ most of Porto\u2019s old buildings have a skylight that illuminates the whole\
  \ of the house. He was a wealth of information, and I half expected that if we were\
  \ to take a formal tour he would have corrected the guide and led the tour himself.\
  \ His desire to share his love for his city and country was infectious, and looking\
  \ over the city from his favorite spot, by the Church of St. Lawrence, I found my\
  \ heartbreak from a few days earlier give way to a newfound fascination and love\
  \ for a city and country to which I had previously not given much thought. \n\n\
  We drank gin and tonics by the Douro River and parted ways too soon, because of\
  \ my travel plans, in front of the C\xE2mara Municipal do Porto. The next day I\
  \ found myself spouting off to my travel buddies random information I had learned\
  \ on my date: \u201CYou know the architect of Cl\xE9rigos Church is buried in it?\u201D\
  \ \u201CYou know why all these houses have those skylights in the middle of them?\u201D\
  \ \u201CDid you know that Portugal has the oldest trade deal with England?\u201D\
  \ And so on and so forth. . . . \n\nA city rooted in tradition, Porto nonetheless\
  \ has an industrious, creative spirit\u2014a respectful mingling of the old and\
  \ new. I will be back, because there is much more that remains to be explored."
