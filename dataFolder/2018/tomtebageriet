Text: "It was lonely in my tiny, empty apartment. The cold January air managed to\
  \ creep its way through the gap between the window and skirting board causing the\
  \ hair on my skin to prickle.\n \nToday, the longest day throughout the duration\
  \ of the Swedish winter, I had moved into a small apartment in Stockholm on the\
  \ 5th floor of an apartment building built in the 80s. I hadn't anticipated the\
  \ extent to which I would feel so isolated once I had moved into the apartment.\
  \ January in Sweden: one of the longest and most difficult of months, not because\
  \ it was different in length to other months, but solely due to being in the thick\
  \ of winter. Never had darkness seemed so insidious: day blended into night and\
  \ night blended into day, and time seemed irrelevant.\n \nBut I had to make the\
  \ most of my situation, especially if I was to last the winter to see the incredible\
  \ seasonal transition into spring, that I had been told by Swedes was worth the\
  \ wait.\n \nCocooned in my puffer jacket and clad in snow boots, I left my apartment\
  \ and walked along the snow-covered ground. Unable to bear the cold for much longer,\
  \ I decided to retreat into a small shop: 'Tomtebageriet'. 'Bageriet', being the\
  \ word for bakery in Swedish and 'Tomte' meaning Santa Claus, was enough to entice\
  \ me and I stepped inside. \n\nWafts of freshly baked cinnamon and cardamom buns\
  \ filled my nostrils and a coffee machine gurgled from behind the counter. I sat\
  \ and took in the delicious smells and waited. A man dressed in shorts and a t-shirt\
  \ came in from the kitchen area I could see at the back of the shop. \n\n\"Hej hej.\
  \ Hur m\xE5r du?\"\n\nI smiled while repeating the greeting to him, \"Hej hej\"\
  . I could tell he knew that I was not a native speaker and he immediately began\
  \ to speak in perfect English asking me where I was from, to which I replied, \"\
  Australia\". \n\nThe man's eyes lit up and half laughed, \"How can you stand the\
  \ winter?\". \n\nAfter a few minutes of polite conversation, I ordered the traditional\
  \ Swedish cinnamon bun and a filtered coffee (all, ashamedly, in English). The combination\
  \ of a hot coffee and the warm, sweet bun was enough to give me a revitalised sense\
  \ of curiosity and desire to explore my new neighbourhood, to see whether I would\
  \ stumble upon little surprises such as Tomtebageriet. I had forgotten about the\
  \ loneliness I felt earlier in my apartment, realising that the winter was hard\
  \ on everyone and I would have to find retreats such as this one to overcome it.\
  \ \n\nTomorrow I would be back for another bun."
