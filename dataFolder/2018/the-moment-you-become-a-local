Text: "Living abroad is characterised by balancing past memories and new experiences.\
  \ There\u2019s only a moment though when you realise you are a living part of your\
  \ new home. Here\u2019s my story\n2012\nLiving in Paris as a local was always a\
  \ dream since I started learning French so when I got the opportunity to study there,\
  \ weekends in Paris was a regular affair. It was the first time I was visiting the\
  \ Mus\xE9e de l'Orangerie and I distinctly remember stepping into the oval salon\
  \ with Les Nymph\xE9as . To capture the same water lilies and follow the reflected\
  \ sunlight through the course of an entire day, to express the vivacity of life\
  \ through the restrain of brushstrokes takes genius. These paintings touched the\
  \ depths of my soul in ways that great art does. I promised myself to return to\
  \ the actual garden in Giverny where Monet painted them, but only when I feel like\
  \ a complete person who has found her footing\n2016\nIt was time to fulfil the promise.\
  \ I had taken time off to do just that. It was a clear spring day when I took the\
  \ train to Giverny. I awaited my turn to enter the house and walked towards the\
  \ garden. As you walk through the tunnel that connects the main house to the pond\
  \ of water lilies, you realise how pregnant the air is with a cornucopia of perfumes.\
  \ From a distance you can see the bridge laced in purple garlands of wisteria. In\
  \ just a few steps you are at same place as in the paintings, untouched by time,\
  \ the lilies, the wisteria and the willows. They are all THERE.\n I stood there\
  \ feeling I don't belong to a particular time, I was here when this was painted,\
  \ I was here when I made the promise and I am here now. I felt a rush of happiness.\
  \ I felt it being metabolised under my skin, slithering through my veins and exploding\
  \ out of my heart like a phoenix. Its flames were thawing those emotions of love,\
  \ of tenderness, of hope that are sometimes left to be fossilised because one simply\
  \ doesn't have the luxury to indulge into vulnerabilities. \nBack in Paris the next\
  \ day, I felt like I had served a life purpose. With no agenda, I picked a book,\
  \ bought lunch and just started walking where my heart took me. I walked from the\
  \ 10th through the Place de la Republique, past Le Marais, crossed the Seine, into\
  \ St. Germain des Pres. Evening was setting in beckoning the sun towards the horizon\
  \ again. I suddenly remembered my book and the baguette, as I settled on a park\
  \ bench. I was about to read Hemmingway in the Jardin de Luxemborg savouring a baguette.\
  \ \n\nLa joie de vivre!"
