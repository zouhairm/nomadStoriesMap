  \ \n\u201CLet\u2019s set off on a road less travelled.\u201D \n\u201CLet\u2019s\
  \ go see the Aurora Borealis!\u201D\nThis was me for 2 years non-stop, appealing\
  \ to my husband before he finally gave in.\n\nTo see the Northern Lights had always\
  \ been on my bucket list and Iceland seemed like the best place for it.I wanted\
  \ to see what I had seen in the movies and make it a real.But somehow it had always\
  \ seemed like a distant dream.Coming from a country like India, we can\u2019t pack\
  \ our bags without extensive planning and just go for it.At 27,when have all these\
  \ exuberant travelling goals it\u2019s hard on the pocket.But we had to make it\
  \ happen.\nSo,there we were standing in front of our rented car at Keflavik International\
  \ airport,ready to set off on our little-but subjectively huge-quest.\nI\u2019d\
  \ chosen the month of September because it was in between summer and winter.It was\
  \ a perfect balance of day and night.It was supposed to be the one of best months\
  \ to see the aurora.It\u2019s windy and rainy year round and I wasn\u2019t too worried\
  \ about that.But,we couldn\u2019t have imagined what winds at 11 miles per hour\
  \ would mean. \nThe next 5 days continued to be grey and gloomy.Every morning we\
  \ started driving away from the clouds but they eventually caught up.It was a funny\
  \ thing-we were chasing the clear skies and the grey skies were chasing us.My hopes\
  \ of seeing the aurora started to dampen.\nBut Iceland wasn\u2019t giving up on\
  \ us.The landscape transformed into something new every few miles.The volcanic mountains\
  \ of Eyjafjallajokull had us repeating the name over and over till we got it right.The\
  \ sight of forever-tumbling enormous waterfalls made us feel insignificant. \nThe\
  \ infinitely stretching black sand beaches gave the feeling of having landed on\
  \ an alien planet.The icebergs at Jokulsarlon glistened like giant floating diamonds.And\
  \ of course the boiling mud pots in sharp contrast to the all ice,reminding us of\
  \ what lay beneath the surface.\n\u201CHow could such a small island have so much\
  \ to offer?\u201D The land of fire and ice was winning me over.Slowly the aurora\
  \ took a backseat. \nOn the 8th day, we finally saw the Northern Lights.Nothing\
  \ can ever describe the magic you feel that first time.And we continued to observe\
  \ it for the next 3 nights.At the end of the vacation all the beauty and wonder\
  \ of Iceland was imprinted on my mind.I had travelled to Iceland with just the thought\
  \ of being wowed by the aurora but I came back with so much more,which was the last\
  \ thing I expected."
