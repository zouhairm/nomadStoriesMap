Text: "I was standing near the door, about to alight at Borivali in a Mumbai suburban\
  \ train fondly called as \u201Clocal\u201D by the Mumbaikars. I see an ocean of\
  \ people who have swarmed the station, waiting to climb into the local. It is the\
  \ last thing I expected to happen on the very first day of my trip after an hour\u2019\
  s wait in a traffic jam on the western expressway forced me to catch a local to\
  \ reach Borivali on time. My heart is pounding. Fear had crept in. Thoughts like,\
  \ \u201CWill I get out safely?\u201D and \u201CWill my belongings be with me while\
  \ I alight?\u201D or \u201CWill some pickpocket steal my wallet?\u201D had clouded\
  \ my mind when suddenly I was taken back to a very distinct memory.\nIt\u2019s the\
  \ year 2012. Me and my friends after our first ever Mumbai trip were going to Bandra\
  \ from Airoli to catch our train to home. We chose to go by the local. It was a\
  \ Sunday evening so we did not anticipate much rush which however to our dismay\
  \ was huge. By the time we had decided to alight at Sion to reach Bandra, the train\
  \ had already entered the station. We scrambled for our bags and tried to make our\
  \ way in a jam packed train with no space to breathe. Unfortunately my bag got stuck.\
  \ I somehow managed to get out rather jumped from a moving local, however I could\
  \ not salvage my luggage. To add to the agony some mischief monger extended his\
  \ hand out from the moving train to hit me hard on my back.\nI was back from my\
  \ thoughts and saw that people had started hopping on to the coaches even before\
  \ the train made a halt. It was a tough fight getting down as everyone else on the\
  \ platform were in no mood to make way. However, aided by my heavy built I somehow\
  \ did get down. Suddenly I hear a scream. A lady in her fifties had fallen on the\
  \ platform while alighting. The fears had come to haunt me again. I stood there\
  \ petrified.\nI then saw something beautiful though. Two men from the crowd pushed\
  \ the others and helped her get up and salvaged her things as she made her way out.\
  \ We two exchanged a glance. She smiled and blessed those two souls for helping\
  \ her in that mad rush.\nI felt a strange mix of happiness and confidence. I returned\
  \ from Borivali also in a local. Faces came and went but there was a warmth that\
  \ many of them did leave behind. I started using the local to commute more and more.\
  \ It\u2019s charm had gripped me. \nThese local commutes now have me excited. I\
  \ am now in love and awe with the \u201CLifeline of Mumbai-The Locals\u201D now.\
  \ Turns out the last thing I expected to happen to me wasn\u2019t the least after\
  \ all!"
