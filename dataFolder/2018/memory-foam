Text: "Wanderlust has always been a habit of mine, but it was a tiny dot that is usually\
  \ non-existent on a generic map that gave me an experience that I will remember\
  \ for the rest of my life; Mana Island, Fiji. Mana Island at a glance is an island\
  \ with \u2018nothing\u2019 in the eyes of the modern World. No power for all of\
  \ your electronic devices, no internet to endlessly scroll through your social media\
  \ accounts, no high street fashion stores to purchase the latest trends, no memory\
  \ foam mattress to help you sleep a little better at night and all those other material\
  \ possessions that have become the desire of millions. But what if you had never\
  \ been introduced to any of it? What if in your World none of that even existed?\
  \ You have to step off the beaten track to find parts of the World that remain untainted\
  \ these days. Perhaps that is the beauty of it - to find a Diamond among Rocks in\
  \ a World that assumes those roles are reversed. Mana Island was not the first place\
  \ I had seen happiness in its purest form, but it would certainly be one of the\
  \ most inspiring. \n\nUpon welcoming me onto the island, a local man told me that\
  \ they share everything in their community; food, water, wood, cooking utensils\
  \ etc. That small sentence alone already had me thinking about how something so\
  \ simple makes so much sense if we apply it to the entire World. Why does anyone\
  \ have more than they need? If there is a need then there is no room for greed and\
  \ for an Island that had \u2018nothing\u2019, those people had everything they ever\
  \ needed. When the cheerful Pacific songs couldn\u2019t be heard, laughter was the\
  \ sound that filled the island as children ran around chasing bugs, playing with\
  \ sticks, climbing trees, swimming in the ocean, doing all of the things that make\
  \ being a child so memorable. If only I could promise a childhood like that for\
  \ my future children \u2013 that tiny island in the South Pacific where it doesn\u2019\
  t matter if they have no phone to scroll through funny videos because they are creating\
  \ their own hilarious moments, no remote-control drone to fly around because their\
  \ imagination makes them feel like they are already flying, no prejudice or judgment\
  \ over what someone else has or doesn\u2019t have, and no memory foam mattress to\
  \ sleep that little bit better because they are sleeping well after another day\
  \ of creating memories not made of foam\u2026 there isn\u2019t a mattress out there\
  \ that could provide as much comfort as that."
