Text: "The moon, round and bright, floated gently between the Artemis Temple\u2019\
  s only two intact columns. As if playing hide-and-seek, it disappeared behind one\
  \ column, appeared when passing the space in-between, only to disappear again behind\
  \ the other, slowly rolling its way amidst the sky, coating Sardis with its butter-colored\
  \ light. The temple\u2019s marble blocks, reflective of the moonlight, seemed whiter,\
  \ standing out from the flattened background of forests and mountains, whose silhouettes\
  \ blended together into a wavelike shape resembling the scales of an enormous monster\
  \ in mythology.\n\nI soon realized I was not alone there, pondering about the glorious\
  \ past of this Lydian city by the Pactolus. The moonlight revealed all secrets.\
  \ Guzin was sitting on top of the West wall, facing the mountains. Monica, arms\
  \ folded under her head, stared quietly at the stars. Every now and then, a summer\
  \ breeze would blow through the trees, singing softly as it traveled over Mount\
  \ Tmolus. When the sound faded out and the air became still, we could feel a complete\
  \ silence wrapping us under the velvet sky. Monica suddenly turned toward me, her\
  \ face dreamy, her mouth whispering, too afraid to break a magic spell, \u201COh\
  \ no, look at that plane, it is going to hit the stars!\u201D We giggled.\n\nThe\
  \ immensity of the sky rendered me speechless. My human brain could not comprehend\
  \ the idea that the light we saw probably came from trillions of miles away and\
  \ millions of years ago, the shear dimensions of which were beyond my imagination.\
  \ Sitting on this ancient ruins, I never before felt so vividly our cosmic insignificance,\
  \ our ephemeral existence and a strange intimacy with our ancestors, the ones who\
  \ had walked the earth and built stone wonders millennia ago, who might have sit\
  \ at the same spot, thinking the same thoughts, feeling the same emotions, looking\
  \ at the same stars. This infinite cosmic web became a fragile yet strong connection\
  \ between us through a past unknown, one that we are destined to see the moment\
  \ we open our eyes toward the sky. \n\nLearning from Monica, I laid down, feeling\
  \ the warmth as the marble blocks released the last bit of heat stored during the\
  \ day, breathing in the smell of damp soil and grass coming through their cracked\
  \ surfaces. I stopped trying to tell apart the bright constellations, stopped dissecting\
  \ my wandering thoughts. The earth beneath me, the sky above me, space and time\
  \ around me converged into an empathy that trembled in every single cell of my body."
