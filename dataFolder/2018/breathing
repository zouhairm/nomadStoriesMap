Text: "I took my shoes off and walked around the pagoda, fascinated by its golden\
  \ stupas, giant Buddhas and glittering statues of Nats - the spirits that the Burmese\
  \ worship together with Buddhism.\n\nI went to Myanmar with an unstated goal in\
  \ me: to understand more about Buddhism from the people who lived by it every day.\
  \ \n\nAfter exploring the country for two weeks, I arrived at Bago. In the middle\
  \ of this congested city with a grey sky stood Shwemawdaw Pagoda, the tallest pagoda\
  \ in Myanmar. Its golden cap glimmered like a powerful, omniscient God amongst an\
  \ ocean of passing scooters. \nInside, I heard a rhythmic and constant murmur. A\
  \ monk, cladded in a maroon robe, chanted in front of a giant seated Buddha. My\
  \ scattered thoughts ceased for an instant, attracted by the marvellous, guttural\
  \ sound. I stood behind him keeping some distance, too scared of disturbing his\
  \ practice. \n\nAll of a sudden, he stopped and turned around. \n\n\u2018Hello!\u2019\
  \ he said with a grin on his face. \u2018Where are you from?\u2019 \nThat was the\
  \ beginning of a long exchange between us. \u2018I\u2019ve been a monk for forty\
  \ years\u2019, he said while cleaning his tiny glasses with a cloth he took from\
  \ a bag lying on the floor. \u2018Before, I had worry and pain and now- all gone!\u2019\
  \ \n\n\u2018How do you meditate?\u2019 I asked after exchanging a few more details\
  \ of our respective lives. \n\u2018Ah! It\u2019s the breathing\u2019 he knelt on\
  \ a red cushion and placed his right hand on the left. \u2018Like this, see? Watch\
  \ the breathing. In and out- just watch. This is Vipassana\u2019. He closed his\
  \ eyes to demonstrate the process further. \u2018Start with five minutes\u2019 he\
  \ continued, \u2018then increase bit by bit. When the mind is calm, you can see\
  \ what lies underneath and-\u2018 \n\u2018What lies underneath?\u2019 I interrupted.\n\
  \u2018Freedom!\u2019 he grinned again lifting his arms, amused, like a child in\
  \ a playground after a long day at school. \nI sat down on the floor to reflect.\
  \ \u2018Buddhism fascinates me\u2019, I said after a long silent gap. \u2018More\
  \ than any other belief system\u2019.\nHe glanced at a table that held statues of\
  \ colourful Nat spirits in the corner. \u2018Ah! we say in Buddhism the heart of\
  \ all people is the same. It\u2019s all the same heart. In meditation, we breathe\
  \ in into the heart and breathe out from the heart space\u2019 \n \u2018I guess\
  \ breathing is like a bridge to and from life\u2019, I said. \n\u2018Yes!\u2019\
  \ my friend seemed pleased. \u2018Practice! You will see\u2019. He sealed his advice\
  \ with another grin. \n\nRaindrops fell outside amongst the golden stupas. The sky\
  \ was still grey, but my heart was suddenly hopeful and content."
