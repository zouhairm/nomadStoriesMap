Text: "The clatter of pots invades my sleep, and I resist, rolling away from the frigid\
  \ tile wall, burrowing further beneath my cocoon of wool blankets.  I have no desire\
  \ to leave my haven and brave a house where the temperature is hovering at 40 F.\
  \ \n\nBut I know Naima will be waiting.\n\nTwo days ago, my fianc\xE9 and I had\
  \ come to this Moroccan riad in the heart of Marrakech, hoping to explore life inside\
  \ the high red walls of the medina, the old city.  This gentle family of mostly\
  \ women speaks almost no English \u2013 but this morning I have been invited to\
  \ help cook breakfast. \n\nI creep into the kitchen, a tiny room with a vaulted\
  \ ceiling and wooden shutters near the top to let in the early morning light.  I\
  \ spy Naima, hair up in a kerchief, faded t-shirt hugging the curve of her middle.\
  \ She nods a greeting, motions me to sit. \n\nI pull a stool up to a large clay\
  \ platter, perched atop a plastic crate.  She sits across from me, rolls dough into\
  \ a ball, and with swift, sure strokes, flattens it into a paper-thin circle, glancing\
  \ at me to be sure I am watching.  She lifts two edges and folds them a third of\
  \ the way across, sprinkling the dough with semolina, then repeats.  The remaining\
  \ column, she folds again, pulling each edge to the center.  She lifts the square,\
  \ nine layers thick, onto a plastic tray and reaches for another ball.  \n\nThree\
  \ times she repeats the process, and I am mesmerized by her deft fingers, the practiced\
  \ ease with which she manipulates the dough.  \n\nThe kitchen has shrunk to just\
  \ the two of us.  The dough is all that matters.\n\nWhen my turn comes, the dough\
  \ is fragile as I flatten it, but eventually Naima nods her approval, then motions\
  \ me to begin folding.  Gingerly, I give it a tug, afraid it will tear, but it comes\
  \ easily off the clay, and I successfully fold my first square of msemen.  This\
  \ traditional pancake is, I later learn, the Moroccan equivalent of comfort food.\
  \  Naima clucks approvingly, lifts it from the pan, and rewards me with another\
  \ ball of dough.  \n\nBit by bit, the tray fills.  Naima hums at the sink, and the\
  \ others appear, lighting a gas burner by the wall, heating porridge, dragging out\
  \ the colorful tajins in every size for serving bowls.  The few words spoken are\
  \ in Arabic, going past me.  \n\nBut I am content to be at the center \u2013 of\
  \ life, of this kitchen.  It is something, I think to myself as I fold the final\
  \ cake, and Naima prepares to fry them.  \n\nIt is something indeed to be among\
  \ women, hands in the dough, helping."
