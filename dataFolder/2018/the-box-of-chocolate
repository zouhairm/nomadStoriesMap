Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t go there, Egypt is not safe\u201D but I booked my flight right\
  \ after the Spring Revolution to Sharm el Sheikh. \nMy destination was Dahab, the\
  \ golden Bedouin village. At bus station, I decided to take a Bedouin taxi so that\
  \ I could enjoy the hot but also aggressive air that was hitting my face together\
  \ with spectacular views of mountains and the empty desert.\nWhen we arrived in\
  \ Dahab was dark, the only shapes I could see were the ones of some men dressed\
  \ in galabea (a long- sleeved dress that covers all the body) cars and some moving\
  \ lights. I felt I entered in another world- so different and so challenging\u2026\
  the Bedouin driver took me to a mystic place.\nAll this emotions made me hungry\
  \ but mafish muskila (no problem) as Egyptian would use to say, so for dinner had\
  \ the national dish koshari (lentils, rice, macaroni, with spicy tomato chili souse)\
  \ and sugar cane juice.\nI spent amazing days in this place, enjoyed the lazy breakfasts\
  \ with falafel (chickpeas balls) or foul maddamas (fava beans) with a hardboiled\
  \ egg on top, and the mango juice in the company of the Red Sea and some hungry\
  \ cats. I still feel the taste of the green-lemongrass-mango tea that my new friend,\
  \ and tea magician, Ahmed, used to offer.\nI was amazed by all the things that Sinai\
  \ Peninsula had to offer from the amazing Mount Sinai cold hike under thousands\
  \ shining stars that ended with a great sunrise to a swim under the moon light,\
  \ or a dive into the colorful world of the Red Sea, or a hike around Blue Hole and\
  \ in the end have a sip of some really sweet cups of Bedouin hospitality together\
  \ with other foreigners or the Friday market along the seaside, where could get\
  \ Egyptian kiss- Basbousa (semolina cake soaked in rose or orange water syrup) was\
  \ sweet as a kiss, bousa means also kiss in Egyptian. \nIn this magical place time\
  \ seems to fly: an old day pass and new day arrives, and new friend will appear\
  \ out of nowhere. Egypt is not only about Pyramids and Pharaohs; there are many\
  \ other details that make it unique and magical. Egypt is a country where I felt\
  \ the most welcomed. In Middle East every country is \u201Csame but different\"\
  , they share some common custom or religions, but the people who live there make\
  \ it special and unique -Egypt is full of gifts.\nSome Egyptian friends used to\
  \ compare Masr (Egypt) with a box a chocolate: once you open it, you will find different\
  \ shapes and tastes, you might not like all what would find in the box, but still\
  \ you can\u2019t stop eating- you get addicted to it."
