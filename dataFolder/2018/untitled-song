Text: "\u201CIf you look out of the window to your right\u2026\u201D my thoughts were\
  \ suddenly interrupted by more unwanted tourist information from my driver.  I knew\
  \ then that I wasn\u2019t going to get a nap, but I was going to be privy to a bunch\
  \ of useless information about Dublin.  My family planned to leave for the countryside\
  \ in the morning and I was too tired to listen to a history lesson.  However I smiled\
  \ and nodded and continued to politely feign interest. As he continued to murmur\
  \ about each landmark we passed, I finally started to pay attention to my surroundings.\
  \  There were Catholic emblems decorating every inch of the dashboard.  Little figurines\
  \ of Mother Mary, cards with Baby Jesus, and Bible verses stuck everywhere from\
  \ the radio knobs to the air-conditioning vents.  A beautiful red and gold rosary\
  \ hung around the rearview mirror.  I was touched by the unapologetic display of\
  \ his faith.  His name was John. He then went on to tell me about his family.  His\
  \ voice lightened ever so slightly, almost wistfully as he spoke about his son who\
  \ lived in the United States.  John had been married to his wife for as long as\
  \ he could remember and when they were all home together in Dublin they liked to\
  \ throw dinner parties for their friends and family.  \u201CYou know, there\u2019\
  s nothing quite as wonderful as dinner with loved ones, wine, laughter\u2026\u201D\
  \ It was at this very moment that John trailed off from speaking and began to sing.\
  \ He had such a beautiful voice.  The voice of a man with natural talent and a comfort\
  \ that can only be developed from years of breaking into song. But the song was\
  \ unexpected.  It wasn\u2019t an upbeat Irish jig that one would associate with\
  \ lively dinner parties.  But rather a song that spoke of endings.  The kind sung\
  \ once the height of laughter had already come and gone.  When eyelids started to\
  \ grow heavy and the occasional yawn escaped those who consumed the most drink.\
  \  But it was time to go your separate ways and who knew when you would meet again.\
  \  Hopefully soon, but maybe not.  So there was also sorrow and longing for a time\
  \ in the future that you hoped would come. \u201CThat was beautiful,\u201D I said\
  \ once the cab was silent. I saw the airport finally come into view in the distance.\
  \  All at once it felt as if I had been inside that cab forever and yet the experience\
  \ was over in the blink of an eye.   When we pulled up to the curb I sighed again,\
  \ this time because I realized that now this cab ride would become one of the memories\
  \ from John\u2019s song."
