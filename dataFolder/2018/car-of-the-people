Text: "I stumbled across the best vegan restaurant I've ever been to in Lima, Peru,\
  \ on a Bug Walk. I loved wandering the city in search of old VW Beetles to photograph,\
  \ and soon had hundreds of photos.\n\nCeviche, lomo saltado, dark chocolate, and\
  \ coffee kept me alive in Lima, where I was living between time in Oxapampa and\
  \ Arequipa. Raw Caf\xE9, just around the corner from the Huaca Pucllana ruins, shook\
  \ up my Peruvian diet. \n\nI visited daily to enjoy large, familiar meals of veggie\
  \ burgers and green juices. I never had trouble getting a seat until one Tuesday\
  \ in February when the cafe was packed. I suddenly realized the white paneled walls\
  \ featuring mantras of wellness gave it an expansive feeling that betrayed its true\
  \ size.\n\n\"Comida para llevar?\" I asked the waitress in my simple Spanish.\n\n\
  \"Por supuesto,\" she smiled. \n\n\"Hey, if you want, you can sit with us,\" an\
  \ American voice announced. \n\nI turned around. A group of ten weary travelers\
  \ sat at the long table where I usually ate. A tanned young man with broad eyes\
  \ and a mop of surfer brown curls smiled. I smiled in response, and sat down.\n\n\
  \"I'm Caroline,\" I introduced myself. \"I'm a writer in Peru for a few months.\"\
  \ \n\n \"Wow,\" he yawned, quickly flashing a smile. The rest of the group, mostly\
  \ women, was engaged in the kind of animated conversation brought on by jet lag.\n\
  \n\"You don't need to know our names, but our heart chakras are open,\" a woman\
  \ explained. \"Where are you from?\"\n\n\"Los Angeles. You guys?\" \n\n\"Malibu,\"\
  \ she replied. \n\nOf course.\n\nWe shared abundant plates of sprouted burgers with\
  \ tomato jam and quinoa bowls with colorful potatoes (Peru is the home of the potato)\
  \ and exchanged photos of cats back home. They told me about their planned journey\
  \ to Cusco the next day to see Machu Picchu and alluded to an ayahuasca ceremony\
  \ afterwards, everything I'd expect from my nameless hippie friends. I told them\
  \ about the magical Alpine village in the middle of the Andes where I had stayed,\
  \ Oxapampa, and my plans to visit Paracas. They envied my ability to leave the country\
  \ after Trump was elected, and I, their sense of community back home. \n\nI said\
  \ goodbye while they lounged over turmeric lattes and fermented teas, thanking them\
  \ for their kindness. I stepped back into San Isidro revitalized-amidst all the\
  \ homesick soul-searching I had done since leaving a stable job for a one-way ticket\
  \ to Peru and a farm in the middle of nowhere, some California hippies reminded\
  \ me that you're always home\u2026if your heart chakra is open."
