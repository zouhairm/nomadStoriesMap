Text: "Istanbul 2016\n\nMy story begins 2 years ago... after one night of hard work\
  \ in Zorlu Center, once I returned to Hotel, I sensed that great adventure was close\
  \ in my first visit to Turkey. \n\nI started working at 10:00 pm during all night,\
  \ once stores in Zorlu Mall closed because I am the expert in charge of Logo repair\
  \ of an important Company, when I finished our works, I had a walk to our \"temporary\
  \ Home\" crossing the city.  I arrived to Hotel at 7:00 am and I tried to sleep\
  \ but I was so excited being in Istanbul. I took a shower and went to center of\
  \ City to view all Monuments of Istanbul. \n\nNormally when we \"visited\" a new\
  \ city we have 2 nights of works in order to check everything first night; and finish\
  \ works completely in the second night and then, next morning, come back to Spain\
  \ having a little rest, so I had 1 day to know Istanbul and see all possible before\
  \ return to Spain.\n\nMy problem is that I am typical weird person that prefers\
  \ to not see any location in each country until arriving to city and discover every\
  \ place with sensation of first time... without any \"idea\" of where I am going\
  \ to stay and live every moment without preconceived opinion and perception. I enjoy\
  \ smells of cities, different atmospheres and local and foreign people, living or\
  \ visiting the city like me. Every corner, millions colours, all type of buildings,\
  \ even in pollution one can find \"magic\" of a new experience.\n\nIn this ocassion,\
  \ Istanbul seems to be my ideal destination because I had never been in a country\
  \ with so different culture, Istanbul is the exclusive city in the world that is\
  \ located in 2 continents, Europe and Asia.\n\nSeparating these continents, we find\
  \ Bosphorus Strait; I was lucky to see it from the plane when I arrived.\n\nThere\
  \ my adventure started. After visiting Santa Sophia and Blue Mosque, Topkapi Palace\
  \ and Galata Tower, I was walking around shore of Bosphorus, with only concern of\
  \ finishing works in few hours that night apart finish visit, loving each moment\
  \ in Istanbul with sadness for the end of my travel. In that moment I saw a person\
  \ floating on his back in the sea and I took my clothes quickly in order to save\
  \ that person. Just in time, when I was ready to threw myself into water, one local\
  \ person stopped me saving my life. Due to I had not sleep I did not realize that\
  \ it was a toy that people threw to water for neighbourhood tradition. My new Hero\
  \ explained all to me, telling about dangerous of Bosphorus water.\n\nI always remember\
  \ that day! Thanks!"
