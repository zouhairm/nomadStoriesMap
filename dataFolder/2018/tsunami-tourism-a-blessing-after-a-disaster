Text: "Early on the morning of December 26, 2004,  a tsunami that lasted eight hours\
  \ brought  widespread devastation to  Indonesia.  One of the deadliest catastrophes\
  \ in human history,it claimed the lives of thousands of people and left behind ruins\
  \ and tales of extreme grief. It failed, however, to harm the people\u2019s strong\
  \ faith and willpower.\nNow, after almost 13 years later, Indonesia, has managed\
  \ to turn the debris  of the tragedy into tourist attractions. The last thing I\
  \ expected was that even the victims'families take part in the promotion campaigns\
  \ .Banda Aceh, in particular, made the tsunami a symbol of both destruction and\
  \ survival. Commemorating the victims and rebuilding their country, the Acehnese\
  \ decided not to surrender to sadness and despair  and created a spiritual tourism\
  \ , commonly called \"tsunami tourism.'' \u201CThe boat on the roof\u201D, one of\
  \ the miracles  in the Lampulo district, was a key tourist attraction etched in\
  \ my memory.\nA girl, who lost her family in this area, welcomes visitors and tells\
  \  the story of  the boat.When the tsunami struck the district, the fishing boat\
  \ was afloat and people jumped into it.  During the eight-hour-tsunami, the boat\
  \ saved more than 20 people.  It was eventually swept on to  a roof. People call\
  \ it \n''The Noah Boat''. \nThis stranded boat nowadays has become one of the tsunami\
  \ monuments and a symbol of survival. \"You can see the names of my mother and grandmother\
  \ on the wall of the house. We have to thank the tsunami for bringing foreigners\
  \ here to see how strong we are. I lost my family but I did not lose hope,\" the\
  \ girl told  me while trying to hold back her tears.  In an expression of their\
  \ gratitude to the countries that helped them following the tsunami, the Acehnese\
  \ established the ''Thanks to the World\" park at the centre of Banda Aceh. The\
  \ Tsunami Museum, the  only one of its kind in Southeast Asia, gives visitors a\
  \ chance to  go back in time via simulations, videos and demonstrations and live\
  \ through the Aceh tsunami.\nCommemorating the tsunami victims, the museum has a\
  \ hall with the names of the victims engraved on its walls. \"We never forget them.\
  \ But, we believe they are in a better place. People from all over the world come\
  \ here and pray for them,\"tour planner Fadhlan Amini, who  worked  for the United\
  \ Nations World Food Programme  from 2005 to 2006 on the west coast of Aceh, said.\
  \ The Acehnese decided not to surrender to sadness and despair, unleashing  the\
  \ city's potential as a major tourist hub and attracting more visitors to the island."
