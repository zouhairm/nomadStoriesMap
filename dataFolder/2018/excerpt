Text: "Coming to Giza Bridge they were confronted with the problem of how to cross\
  \ it. There was no stoplight at the intersection and when Jack stepped off the curb\
  \ he had to quickly jump back to avoid being hit. They stood on the sidewalk for\
  \ several minutes wondering how to get across. Jill suggested they wait for other\
  \ pedestrians to arrive and to cross with them. When two men showed up Jack and\
  \ Jill readied themselves to fall in behind them as soon as they stepped off the\
  \ curb. But the men were too fast. They were left standing on the curb while the\
  \ men were half way across the intersection. \n     Jack looked to the left at the\
  \ tangle of cars coming over the bridge. The car in the lane nearest to the curb\
  \ was still a few yards from them but approaching very fast.\n     \u201CFuck it!\u201D\
  \ he said. \n Clutching Jill\u2019s hand tightly in his own he stepped off the curb.\
  \ They were in the intersection with traffic barreling towards them. Jill braced\
  \ herself for the expected impact. Her scream was lost in a cacophony of car horns.\
  \ She felt a gust of wind on the back of her legs as cars zoomed passed. She would\
  \ have stood there frozen had Jack not been pulling her along. Not one car came\
  \ to a stop, or even bothered to slow, but instead swerved into other lanes to avoid\
  \ hitting them. On reaching the other side Jack immediately fell to his knees laughing.\
  \ The adrenaline rushing through his system coupled with his amazement at having\
  \ escaped death found its release in laughter. \n     \u201CThat\u2019s the secret,\u201D\
  \ he shouted. \u201CYou don\u2019t go fast. You walk real slow and give them time\
  \ to swerve around you.\u201D\nJill waited for his laughter to subside, for her\
  \ heartbeat to return to normal, and for the trembling to stop, before venturing\
  \ that they hail a cab to take them the rest of the way. Jack was amenable to the\
  \ idea. \n     They were on an overpass where the October 6th Bridge descends into\
  \ Shari Ramses. From the back seat of the taxi Jack had a view down onto people\u2019\
  s balconies, drying clothes slung over the balustrades. He caught sight in one apartment\
  \ of a man dragging a goat outside onto the balcony, by both ears. He wondered if\
  \ the goat was a pet or tomorrow night\u2019s dinner. Jack had come to Egypt seeking\
  \ a place as far removed as possible from his own personal frame of reference. So\
  \ far he was not disappointed. He was in love with this city, so different from\
  \ any other city he\u2019d ever visited, where just crossing the street was an adventure."
