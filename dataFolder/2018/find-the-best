Text: I have travelled to Jordan in 1998 for 5 months that I moved there to get suitable
  job because we faced a blockage in our country in these times and many of people
  from my country went overseas to search for new matched opportunities and for me
  it was a hard experience because I must find work to live and I might send some
  of it for my family in my country that I had continued searching for work a long
  time and after many three months I found a simple job as a paper distributor in
  fact I worked in this job just a little time because its salary doesn't cover all
  my living and housing expenses, then I convert to work as a translator in translation
  office in Amman and in this job I had translated many of letters and books for people
  and theses or researches for the students or make speech for sick people for international
  health institutes and hospitals and from Jordan to other countries and verse versa
  in English and Arabic, but in fact the paid money wasn't enough too this real subject
  in this country and they might didn't give the one anything and they told him that
  ( You are just a stranger ) in this simply way and the one couldn't do anything
  with this situation and he ought to accept his manner and if he tried to oppose
  or protest he might dismiss from this terrible country, then after this bitter experience
  I decided to return to my home county because I felt my staying in country like
  that was not useful and without or in vain
