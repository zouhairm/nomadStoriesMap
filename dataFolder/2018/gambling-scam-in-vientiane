Text: "It all started yesterday. I was walking back to my hotel when two ladies came\
  \ to greet me and ask me where I was from. Nothing unusual so far, people from Lao\
  \ are super friendly. When I said I was French, they immediately talked about their\
  \ daughter who was waiting for a visa to go study in Lyon. Cool, but I don\u2019\
  t care. They bought me a beer to wait for the daughter to come, I said to myself\
  \ \u2018why not? I don\u2019t have a better plan for the evening\u2019. Short version:\
  \ they paid for a beer, we talked but the daughter never came so they suggested\
  \ to meet again in the morning. Once again, I said why not, I didn\u2019t have a\
  \ plan for the next day.\n\nI meet them in front of the Palace, they bring me to\
  \ their uncle\u2019s house. Lunch and coffee are served, but still the daughter\
  \ isn\u2019t there. The uncle tells me how he used to be a dealer at a casino\u2019\
  s blackjack table, and suggests a scam to win money. Rather, he teaches me how to\
  \ trick the bank. During fifteen minutes, he shows me the real scam as he is dealing.\
  \ Amusing, but I don\u2019t see the link between the visa\u2019s daughter and the\
  \ casino.\nThen the banker comes, all suited with a big shiny ring on one finger.\
  \ Like a pimp who wants to look respectably honest before his trial. The uncle puts\
  \ $200 on the table, the banker puts two wads: \u201Cbecause I\u2019m the banker,\
  \ I put $2000\u201D. Except neither him nor the uncle counted the money. The two\
  \ $100 bills could have been fake too. We play, and I win easily thanks to the scam,\
  \ but it is so blatantly obvious that I feel ashamed, which accentuates even more\
  \ the pressure of this place. I have my back against the wall, and can see the window\
  \ through the uncle\u2019s glasses, it\u2019s still an enclosed space, 3 against\
  \ 1. Finally comes the moment I don\u2019t have enough money to bid against the\
  \ banker, by the way since when does a banker bet like it\u2019s poker? I don\u2019\
  t want to put my money on the table so I lose: \u201CI don\u2019t feel comfortable\
  \ with this situation, and where is your daughter?\u201D\nThe game stops. The banker\
  \ takes his wads as well as the $200, though he only won $140, and disappears as\
  \ fast as he came. I get out and suggest to meet at the restaurant in the evening,\
  \ this time with their daughter. I am given a ride back.\nDuring the whole ride,\
  \ I had the feeling the entire town could turn suddenly against me. My survival\
  \ instincts kicked back and I became fully aware of everything around me, ready\
  \ to jump at a moment\u2019s notice. After the ride, I kept a close eye everywhere\
  \ around. I never went to the restaurant."
