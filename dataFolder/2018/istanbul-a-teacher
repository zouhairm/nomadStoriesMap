Text: "We headed back towards the Sea. My new friend tensed as the group of his friends\
  \ approached. The leader talked heatedly to him in unfamiliar Turkish and then turned\
  \ to me. \u201CGo! Go now,\u201D he shouted angrily. I wanted to shout back at him,\
  \ my American sensibilities misguiding me, but my friend shook his head. Confused,\
  \ I walked away, looking back at him once. He smiled and gave me a nod. Not four\
  \ hours in this new land, I had stumbled.\nMy quest was postcards. I had landed\
  \ in Istanbul, fellow passengers applauding with relief, and I\u2019d survived a\
  \ cab ride, my driver stopping right in a busy intersection to greet a pedestrian,\
  \ disturbing only to me. Edgy and inpatient, I left the hotel on my quest.\nIn the\
  \ Barkikoy neighborhood, to the west of the tourism of the historic city center,\
  \ the park along the Sea of Marmara was filled with locals, enjoying friends and\
  \ family. The Sea held the distance in a slight haze, a ferry heading towards Yenikapi,\
  \ and chaotic deep blue water. Those around me immune to or resisting the water\u2019\
  s draw; I was enraptured. A young man interrupted me to take a picture with his\
  \ friends. \nI headed away from the river, past pharmacies, kebab windows, housewares.\
  \ My quest would not be easy. A shy tap on my shoulder, I turned to see one of the\
  \ friends from the park. I said, \u201CPostcards?\u201D using my hands. He nodded\
  \ and we walked. Groups of men drank tea from small vase-shaped glasses held in\
  \ palm-sized bowls, delicately balanced in knotted hands. Women carried babies and\
  \ shopping bags, examined fabric, spoke softly to each other. My new friend led\
  \ me into the post office, an austere building. To my doubting face, he said, \u201C\
  Come.\u201D There, behind the line of local customers, was a rack of postcards.\
  \   \nGiddy, I picked out scenes layered with history, the Hagia Sophia, the Blue\
  \ Mosque. Yes, the Grand Bazaar. Unimpressed with my choices, my friend\u2019s eyes\
  \ scanned the minarets, the crowded shops, with disdain. He pulled out a card and\
  \ handed it to me, pointing with pride at the Bosphorus Bridge. I added the 1973\
  \ suspension bridge to my pile of relics. We left and then encountered his friends,\
  \ ordering me to go. \nI was a stranger here and I needed to slow down. Istanbul\
  \ would not allow me to race and check off the monuments from history books; it\
  \ demanded I learn to feel the past, present and future. I had stumbled, but the\
  \ city would let me try again. My quest was complete\u2014I had a postcard of a\
  \ bridge I had not come to see to remind me how to travel."
