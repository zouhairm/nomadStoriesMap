Text: "I woke up and looked around. The bed across from me, the only other piece of\
  \ furniture in the room, was a hazy shape in the dark. It must have been around\
  \ five in the morning, barely dawn. I wanted to get a few more minutes of sleep\
  \ and shifted around, but couldn\u2019t find a comfortable position on the wooden\
  \ board of a bed. The cold rushed into my sleeping bag as I moved and I wrapped\
  \ myself as tightly as I could, waiting for the light to come.\n\nThe light would\
  \ come eventually but I couldn\u2019t get back to sleep and it felt like it\u2019\
  d been forever. I reluctantly shuffled out of my sleeping bag and into three more\
  \ layers of clothes. I\u2019d started foregoing the concept of sleeping clothes\
  \ two days ago. It was cold and the more clothes I could keep on the better. Two\
  \ pairs of socks later and I was ready to brush my teeth under the icy trickle \
  \ of a faucet outside. \n\nI heard chanting. Not surprising, since we were living\
  \ beside a monastery for the night. I followed the sounds and ended up in front\
  \ of a small shack. The only place for food in the area. I walked in. The lady owner\
  \ was busy at the counter and a sprinkling of other early-rising hikers sat around\
  \ various tables, quietly huddled over warm soup. In the far corner, sat a Tibetan\
  \ monk, chanting quietly in a voice that nonetheless filled the whole room. I sat\
  \ down and ordered a garlic soup, listening to this early morning chant. In these\
  \ words that I couldn\u2019t understand, I felt calm. The monk was offered a beer\
  \ by the lady owner. He drank, smiled, and was on his way. \n\nI\u2019d once read\
  \ a story of a man who packed away all his material possessions, down to the underwear\
  \ on his body, and went home to his empty house. Every day, he would allow himself\
  \ to bring one object back home. In this way, he found what he really needed. \n\
  \nI hadn\u2019t found what I needed by living off the pack on my back for two weeks,\
  \ but I found a sense of awareness. Walking in the mountains pared life down to\
  \ the basics. Sleep, eat, walk, sleep, eat walk. For the first time in a long while,\
  \ my insides aligned with my outsides. I think that\u2019s what peace is."
