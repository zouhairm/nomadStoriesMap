Text: "Four friends, Alba, Bia, Gabi e Maria, and I went to Budapest on December 31st,\
  \ 2016 to celebrate the new year and in that night we had a lot of fun, we drunk,\
  \ ate a really good food, danced and met people from different parts of theworld.\
  \ When it was midnight a lot of people ran to the street to see the lights and than\
  \ hug each other, my friends and I even cried thinking about our friendship, our\
  \ last year together and the great year that was Just begining. \nIn the next night\
  \ we decided to go to a bar and when we were leaving Bia asked if one of us had\
  \ taken the Keys, the one from the hostel door and the other from the room\xB4s\
  \ door and Alba said that she had, then we left. The bar was fantastic, it was grounded,\
  \ rustic and had a good music and there we found some Brazilians friends from last\
  \ night, we had a great moment drinking and dancing together. When it was like 3\
  \ a.m. we decided to come back, but Bia, Gabi e Maria went to the Brazilians apartment,\
  \ Alba and I went to our hostel by walking, it was winter but our hostel was close\
  \ so there was no problem, when we arrived in front of the hostel, Alba took the\
  \ key and she noticed that was the wrong one, it was from the room\xB4s door not\
  \ from the hostel\xB4s door and we couldn\xB4t come in so started to push the Bell\
  \ but no one got up to open the door, after one our trying we gave up and started\
  \ to walk by the street in a -11\xBA looking for some place to stay until dawn,\
  \ then we found a Subway, we came in, asked two sandwiches and sat in a table between\
  \ a group of French and Italian guys that suddenlly started a fight and one of the\
  \ employees pushed everybody out, Alba and I were in the cold again and there was\
  \ no place to go. \nSo we Just sat on the floor in front o four hostel waiting for\
  \ someone, meanwhile we were hugged, freezing and talkin about how good our year\
  \ had begun or how good it could be if we didn\xB4t die by hypothermia. At about\
  \ 9 o\xB4clock the hostel opend and we ran to our room and warm bed to sleep like\
  \ two babbies."
