Text: "He called himself Tony Montana. Only he dragged out the \u201Cta\u201D and\
  \ pronounced the a\u2019s like ah\u2019s, so that it sounded more like Kiswahili:\
  \ \u201CMon-TAH-nah\u201D. As we sat around the table observing his messy afro and\
  \ taking in his sultry, seemingly contrived Jamaican accent, I wondered if he was\
  \ mentally stable. \n\nI never knew that Christian fanaticism was so pervasive in\
  \ Nigeria that Rastafarians were persecuted there. He had been jailed and roughed\
  \ up by police who shaved off his dreads and forced him to flee the country... or\
  \ so he said.\n\nIn the night, while music from the Festival of the Dhow Countries\
  \ engulfed us and smoke billowed from dozens of grills cooking all kinds of kabobs,\
  \ Tony told us about his journey from central Africa to Zanzibar. \n\nWhen he started\
  \ talking about the benefits of cannabis, our classmate cut across him. Christopher\
  \ was a devout Tanzanian Christian who\u2019d had enough of this story. He refused\
  \ to believe that there was anything good about marijuana. Actually, he pronounced\
  \ it, \u201CMaw-ri-ZHWAH-na\u201D. \n\nAbout fifty American and Tanzanian students\
  \ had met to study architecture and urban planning from an East African perspective\
  \ in Dar es Salaam. In the end, we\u2019d be Fulbright-Hayes scholars, but our connections\
  \ and memories would go far beyond anything simply academic.\n\nThe night we met\
  \ Tony was our first night in Zanzibar. We blasted out of a hostel somewhere in\
  \ Stone Town and made a b-line for the shore. It was so dark that several of us\
  \ clustered together and linked arms in two\u2019s and three\u2019s while we made\
  \ up stories about what might jump out at us and laughed our way down the road.\
  \ \n\nWe got to the House of Wonders and split off into a dozen directions. I stuck\
  \ with David and Boniphace as we walked between rows and rows of carved wood art.\
  \ We decided to catch a show in the nearby amphitheater. It was a stone structure\
  \ stained gray from what seemed like centuries of elemental exposure. \n\nAs the\
  \ show started, the words of our design professor, Dr. Julius Lekule, hung in the\
  \ air around me:\n\n\u201CArchitecture helps to solve social problems if the liberating\
  \ intentions of the architect coincide with the real practice of the people in the\
  \ exercise of their freedom.\u201D\n\nWe had traveled to study architecture and\
  \ to understand that at the heart of good design was freedom. Tony had traveled\
  \ in search of it. Had we truly found a Haven of Peace?"
