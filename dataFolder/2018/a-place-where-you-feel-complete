Text: "It was 5pm. We were supposed to get in the car and drive towards our next destination,\
  \ Barcelonnette. But I didn\xB4t want to go. I wanted to explore more of that amazing\
  \ city: Nice. \nIf only we had at least one more day there and forget that we had\
  \ a schedule to follow.\nCastle Hill transfixed me quite. Oh the view! I wish I\
  \ had been able to stay there longer! I am not a fan of the beach but that place\
  \ had a halo around it that relaxed me. It made me feel calmed. It gave me peace.\
  \ \nI walked around the place, under the shadow of the trees, under the heat of\
  \ the sun. There was a breeze in the air that invited me to keep discovering those\
  \ halls. All around me, I could hear the waves and smell the salty ocean. In front\
  \ of me I could see the ruins of an 11th century castle. Plants, trees and flowers\
  \ have grown all around the old walls. A waterfall mixes with a scenery of what\
  \ used to be the entrance of the chateau and guards used to stand guard. I could\
  \ only look at it and imagine the people that traded those paths all those years\
  \ ago. The battles that happened there. I bet it was a great place to die for your\
  \ country: a battle next to one of the most peacefully sights ever created. \nI\
  \ walked down the hill with much regret. \nAs we walked towards the car we stumbled\
  \ across the Promenade du Paillon. The sun was going down. A guy was singing and\
  \ playing a guitar. Along the promenade runs these set of fountains that shoot savagely\
  \ out of the floor with no particular pattern. Or maybe they do but I didn\xB4t\
  \ know it. The water was dancing and people was happy to become its partner. \n\
  I knew it was late, we needed to hit the road but I didn\xB4t care. I wanted to\
  \ be a partner of the water too. I walked, ran, jumped and danced with the water.\
  \ My shoes got wet, my jeans got splashed, my phone got some drops on the camera\
  \ lens. It didn\xB4t matter. I was one with the music, the reminding sun, the color\
  \ street lights that slowly were turning on and the other careless dancers around\
  \ me.\nAfter some 10 minutes of my dance I reached the edge of the promenade only\
  \ to find my sister looking at me with a face of \u201CIs late, we have to go\u201D\
  \ that reminded me when I was little and I didn\xB4t want to go to sleep because\
  \ my day was so exciting and my mom had to drag me to bed. \nGoodbye Nice for now.\
  \ I shall comeback with more time to dance on your promenades, to throw rocks at\
  \ your rocky beach, with stronger legs to run all the way up Castle Hill and rest\
  \ peacefully under the shade of your ancient trees."
