Text: "The bus driver left us on People\xB4s Square. Watches were showing 15.42. Great.\
  \ We had around 2 hours until closing a museum. No need to hurry. Why not go somewhere?\n\
  Following the path, we walked into People\xB4s Park. It was the season of blossom\
  \ tree, so very overcrowded. Children were screaming, couples were talking, writing\
  \ on phones or taking selfies.\nGoing deeper to the park, I admit, we got lost.\
  \ Being lost can be fun, but I didn\xB4t feel that comfortable in China. I was holding\
  \ our paper map and trying to find a way to Shanghai Museum. Unsuccessful.\nI told\
  \ my friend to have a break. We sit on the bench and looked around. I saw a father\
  \ with his daughter. The little girl had black hair with fringe, chubby cheeks and\
  \ she was holding a plastic bag tied on a wooden stick. She gave it to him. Two\
  \ small jumps, smile and the excitement in her eyes disclosed that something interesting\
  \ will happen. He walked across the stone curb with the stick and dipped it into\
  \ the pond. Fishing? Really?\nMy attention was taken by another couple which came\
  \ and sat in front of me. This dad put his plastic bag with something moving in\
  \ on the bench. He opened it and his son took precisely small koi fish and throw\
  \ it into the water. Dad looked at him and smiled. I smiled too.\n\u201CExcuse me\u2026\
  \u201D\nMy thinking was disturbed. He impressed me just by the way of standing there.\
  \ A bit shy, a bit curious, but not as other locals watching me the whole day. Well,\
  \ blond hair in China was like a sun in the sky during the night. Everyone can obviously\
  \ see I am just a tourist.\nThis was also HIS reason why he came. He was 13. I was\
  \ surprised how well he spoke English, by his bravery of coming alone and talking\
  \ to foreigners. This was his way of learning English. Talking to them. He asked\
  \ about our country. Slovakia. The small country in the heart of Europe, not even\
  \ known by all Europeans. He knew about it and was interested in our culture as\
  \ well as our studies in Denmark which brought us to China. He told us more about\
  \ China, traditions, differences in caste and talked long about his dreams.\nIt\
  \ was a fascinating conversation. In the end, his dad came to call him. He introduced\
  \ us and to my surprise, his dad said thank you, took out an old Chinese coin from\
  \ his pocket and gave it to us. We wished all the best to each other and said goodbye.\
  \ Goodbye to Kevin and his dad.\nOf course, we missed opening hours at the museum,\
  \ but I got something extraordinary. Meeting with him gave me feeling I can\xB4\
  t describe."
