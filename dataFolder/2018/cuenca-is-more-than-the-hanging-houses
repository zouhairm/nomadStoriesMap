Text: "Cuenca. It's probably not the best-known city in Spain, but it has something\
  \ that catches you and the hanging houses of the city have nothing to do with it.\
  \ They're one of the most visited things of Cuenca. The particularity of these buildings\
  \ is that they're situated on the eastern border of the ancient city, whose windows\
  \ are into the Hu\xE9car river. Nowadays only remains two of them.\nIn the heart\
  \ of the city, we find an antiaircraft tunnel in Alfonso VIII street, but it's not\
  \ the only one. Why? Cuenca is situated between Madrid and Valencia, during the\
  \ civil war (1936-1939) it was bombarded with the intention of breaking communication\
  \ between the two cities. The objective of the fascists was breaking the train tracks.\
  \ They were trying to cut the supplies of the Republicans at all cost. In this tunnel,\
  \ every day there are performances that illustrate how the people lived and how\
  \ they suffered the civil war. The script is made of true stories of local people\
  \ and it's really heartbreaking.\nCuenca has a charm that not all the cities in\
  \ Spain have. Maybe it's because of its history. It's important to keep in mind\
  \ that the cathedral is one of the first Gothic ones built in Spain. It was built\
  \ by the order of the king Alfonso VIII, who conquered the city of the Arabs (1177)\
  \ that were in the peninsula in those times.\nThe magic of the cathedral is in the\
  \ stained-glass. The Gothic cathedrals have the light as the principal element of\
  \ all. It's this element through the people can find God. It's a huge cathedral\
  \ that incorporates elements of different artistic styles apart from Gothic. There\
  \ are architectonical elements of the Renaissance, the Baroque and also Gothic Revival\
  \ architecture.\nThe ancient city of Cuenca is situated in the top of a rocky hill,\
  \ between the J\xFAcar and Hu\xE9car rivers. In the Middle Ages was a huge city\
  \ without space enough to keep the population. It's for that reason that they invented\
  \ a series of technics to create new rooms between houses. The buildings were higher,\
  \ the skyscrapers of the times. In contrast, we have the \"rascainfiernos\" (as\
  \ local people call them) an antonym of the former, that were apartments underground.\n\
  Cuenca is a city to discover, to explore. It seems that there's nothing, that it's\
  \ just a city in Castilla-La Mancha not of importance, but that's far from reality.\
  \ I just can't forget what a local woman said: \"Cuenca is more than the hanging\
  \ houses\". And it's true, so true. Cuenca has a heart, a true heart."
