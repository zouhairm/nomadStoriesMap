Text: "The plane bound for Srinagar is full of Indian soldiers and I quickly realize\
  \ that the capital of Jammu and Kashmir is not only famous for its pashmina wool\
  \ and pristine peaks, but also for the grave political problems seething under the\
  \ surface since Partition in 1947. Then the snow-capped peaks of the Himalayan mountain\
  \ range begin towering up to out-shine each other. Most impressive of all stands\
  \ Habba Khatoon, 8,000 feet high and shaped like a pyramid. It is the mount which\
  \ feeds the River Jhelum, the fertile valley called Gurez in Urdu, and the town\
  \ I\u2019m flying to. \n\nAs soon as the plane touches ground, a dark Kashmiri man\
  \ urges me to stay on his house boat. His golden creoles catch the afternoon sun\
  \ as we drive to town past countless control points. Srinagar has a population of\
  \ about 1,000,000 and lies on the western end of Dal Lake, yet it seems that there\
  \ are two rivaling types of people living here; the ones who live on land and those\
  \ who reside on the water.\n\nBeyond the 1200 houseboats, built in the style of\
  \ the late British Raj, the town\u2019s floating gardens stretch. Narrow boats,\
  \ shikaras, slice the water soundlessly. Below us, neon green algae billows out\
  \ in ghostly sweeps. This is not surprising for all excrements are directly dumped\
  \ here. On land crooked streets with lopsided houses lean heavily on each other\
  \ while cross-legged shopkeepers, framed in by their wares, sit in dark alcoves.\
  \ The grander buildings have slanted rooves, like pagodas, and wooden balconies.\
  \ Then the call to prayer rises into the dwindling light and the Boulevard comes\
  \ to life, house-boats switch on their bulbs, and the embers of a water pipe being\
  \ smoked on a shikara is mirrored on the lake\u2019s table-top. \n\nThe next day,\
  \ I set out for the major sightseeing attraction: the floating market. The shikara\
  \ drifts past grazing sheep and rickety houses on patches of reed amidst the water.\
  \ Hundreds of long-tipped boats nose each other, piled high with vibrant greens\
  \ and bundles of white lotus as dawn breaks, revealing the crowns of the mountains\
  \ in their full glory.\n\nThe climate is harsh but the inhabitants have a dream\
  \ as unattainable as the lofty peaks they see each day. They dream of independence\
  \ from India and this keeps them as warm as the congdis, the ash filled clay pots\
  \ they carry under their ponchos in winter. Their hopes are like the fragile paper\
  \ kites the children fly when the wind sweeps down from the snowy slopes, home of\
  \ the secret gods guarding this patch of earth."
