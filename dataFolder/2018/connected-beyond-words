Text: "Flapping with pride on the dreamy ripples of \u201CChilika\u201D Asia's largest\
  \ brackish water was the picturesque flock of snow white pelicans, siberian cranes\
  \ presenting a view so breathtaking and forming the inception of what seems like\
  \ the beginning of an indelible journey.\nAfter a sumptuous brunch of juicy tiger\
  \ prawns, I with 15 other tourists, boarded the motorboat to cover Nalaban Island,\
  \ Kalijai in Chilika. Like a typical Sagittarian, I was super excited to travel,\
  \ unfold rhythms of life in these 5 hours journey with 15 decked-up faces whom I\
  \ was seeing for first time, including the boatman \u201CRabi\u201D and 12-year-old\
  \ \u201CLima\u201D, daughter of Rabi. \n\nAs the boat, jet-lined through waves,Lima\
  \ from local high school, standard VII made us play games \u201CGuess local cuisine,\
  \ Country- Capital\u201D. Trust me, she was so cordial, fluent, perfectly intelligent\
  \ and developed an amicable connection with each one of us. She explained in archetypal\
  \ Indi-English rather Odiya-English accent the mythology of Goddess Kalijai. A cold\
  \ breeze waved my bare skin with the story of \u2018Kalijai\u201D who once believed\
  \ to be \u201Ca newly married girl (named Jai) was lost in this island when a furious\
  \ cyclone hit the boat.  Since then to avoid any accidents, every boatman started\
  \ their day by enchanting prayers in name of \u201CMaa Kalijai\u201D with vigor\
  \ and strength. As we reached the island, beauty and vibes of spirituality of the\
  \ temple were stupendously incredible as described. \n\nPost Noon, as we sailed\
  \ back from far stretched shimmering golden carpet to the land of migratory birds:Nalaban\
  \ Island, I was beheld with majestic cranes, swans, pelicans, seagulls sailing in\
  \ thousands in serenity.  Chirps, quacks, clicks, continued without a blink when\
  \ suddenly boat got stuck with water ferns from underneath and injured a crane.\
  \ We all rushed to Rabi if we could be of any help to him. But much to my surprise,\
  \ I became numb when Rabi and few tourists started discussing how tasty it would\
  \ be to relish this wounded crane\u2019s meat. Suddenly Lima jumped into water,\
  \ got the injured crane to deck half-alive and held her light in her laps. My wretched\
  \ heart started pounding when Rabi, the father slapped her tight for the Cognitive\
  \ humanity, I believe.\nI stared at her pale, brown, tearful eyes, as they whispered\
  \ mine loudly\n\nOh! Mother Earth,\nI crave for knowledge beyond education,\nI crave\
  \ for virtuousness beyond existence,\nI crave for love beyond acceptance,\nAt least,\
  \ lend me wings and I will flutter,\nTill I rest in Solitude."
