Text: "McFlynn\u2019s Free House was warm and cozy. A small, antiquated pub just blocks\
  \ from St. Pancras Station. A perfect safe haven from London\u2019s chilly evening\
  \ air. McFlynn\u2019s wasn\u2019t empty, but packed it was not. Springsteen\u2019\
  s \u201CGlory Days\u201D thumped from the jukebox as the Eurovision finale aired\
  \ on TV. My fianc\xE9 and I stood at the bar grasping our ales, enjoying our final\
  \ night in London. \n\n As The Boss belted, the bell above the door rang. Standing\
  \ in the doorway was Roberto. He sauntered up to the bar to order a drink. Eavesdropping,\
  \ I could tell he knew no English. With my best Spanish I asked where he\u2019s\
  \ from. \u201CArgentina.\u201D I swing back, \u201CTe gusta Messi?\u201D He returned\
  \ with a smile, \u201CSi.\u201D\n\n I ask him to join us; he obliges. Soon after\
  \ finding our seats we realize communication is cumbersome. My Spanish barely better\
  \ than his English. Then, Roberto\u2019s eyes light up and he says, \u201Cun momento.\u201D\
  \ He pulls out his phone and types away. \n\n He finishes and gives me his phone.\
  \ Opened is Google Translate with two paragraphs. The first in Spanish, and the\
  \ second translated into English. Ah-ha! Genius, Roberto! I type a response in my\
  \ phone and hand it to him. This uncommon form of communication continues for a\
  \ bit. We laugh and smile sharing our phones back and forth. Every reaction from\
  \ the two of us garners a reaction from my fianc\xE9. \n\n        \u201CWhat did\
  \ he say?\u201D I tell her Roberto questions and responses. She smiles too.\n\n\
  \        The night reached its serendipitous zenith when Roberto and I happened\
  \ to be typing at the same time. I finish first. I slide my phone to him. He reads\
  \ it. A smile forms. He gives me his phone and I read it. My eyes tear up. \u201C\
  Wow.\u201D \n\n        The message I typed to Roberto: \u201CI am so glad to have\
  \ met you. This is why I travel. The moments you don\u2019t expect.\u201D \n\n \
  \       Roberto\u2019s message: \u201CIt\u2019s these small moments in life we must\
  \ treasure.\u201D\n\n        Identical messages expressed at the same time. We stand\
  \ and embrace. He kisses me on the cheek. \n\n        The night continues like this\
  \ until McFlynn\u2019s closes its doors. We find ourselves shivering in the middle\
  \ of a dimly lit cobblestone street. It\u2019s quiet. Just the three of us, saying\
  \ our goodbyes. This time with no phones. Goodbyes require no translation. \n\n\
  \        Roberto disappears into the darkness. My fianc\xE9 and I share a smile.\
  \ The cold air begins to take hold. Strong as it was, it couldn\u2019t extinguish\
  \ the warmth we received from the man from Argentina."
