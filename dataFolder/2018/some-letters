Text: "Suddenly, I turned to the left and I saw her crying. She did not want to come\
  \ in and I felt worried.\n-\u201CMy brother told me yesterday that I am a bad Christian\
  \ and that I will go to hell\u201D, she said tearfully.\nI was volunteering for\
  \ the first time in Arequipa, Peru, and I just simply did not know what to say.\
  \ My first reaction, though, was to comfort her saying that this was not true, that\
  \ God loved her, no matter I am not a believer, because I noticed how important\
  \ this was for her. I also told her that her older brother also loved her, despite\
  \ his words.\n-\u201CNo! I\u2019m sure he hates me!\u201D, she yelled immediately.\n\
  I just hugged her until she calmed down. Some days after our conversation, she asked\
  \ me if I could give her something of mine, so that she could remember me. I could\
  \ not do anything else than smile to her and nod.\nOn that moment I still could\
  \ hear those threatening words before my journey: \u201CThey are waiting for you\
  \ in South America\u201D. And they were right. They were waiting for me, but with\
  \ open arms. The night before we had to leave, I wrote a little story for her:\n\
  Once upon a time there were some letters who loved to dance and laugh. When they\
  \ were together, they used to play and, all in all, they enjoyed who they were.\
  \ They held their hands and started to walk. Sometimes happened that one of them\
  \ got distracted, stumbled and fell flat on its face. But, fortunately, the rest\
  \ was there in order to lift it up and keep it company until it recovered from the\
  \ bump. The question was, as they said, to be together. And they behaved just like\
  \ this everywhere they went. Other times, they met a different group of letters\
  \ who made fun of them. These ones took advantage of any occasion to trip them up\
  \ and to see them fall. However, the first ones knew that they were stronger. They\
  \ would overcome them despite the fact that they did not outnumber them. In fact,\
  \ what kept them safe was their word. The one they gave meaning. Their word was\
  \ LOVE. Love is what brought them towards new horizons, whereas HATE, full of impotence,\
  \ did not understand why their word took them nowhere.\nWhen I told her my story\
  \ and reassured her that her brother loved her, she smiled at me and gave me that\
  \ intense hug which touches you deeply while you feel a lump in your throat. I turned\
  \ away wondering if she would ever keep the story, but knowing that a part of me\
  \ stayed in Arequipa. Hoping that maybe in the future she will remember those moments\
  \ shared and she will smile again. At least I will."
