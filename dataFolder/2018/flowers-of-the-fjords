Text: "The light hits my eyes through the window. \nI wake up confused, I grope around\
  \ for my phone to check the time, I guess thats\u2019s in the my backpack.\nIt\u2019\
  s 3.55 am, but here the Sun has already risen up. \n\nIn Iceland Nature has no half\
  \ measures.\nWhen it\u2019s Winter the night is like a long cloak, covered by the\
  \ northern lights. \nThis cloak tries to keep the people who live here warm.\nOn\
  \ the other hand, when the Summer comes, the Day takes his payback. \nIt concedes\
  \ to the Night nothing more than a quick apparition. \nThis is the struggle of these\
  \ latitudes, which has been going on since long before man started to walk across\
  \ these wild lands.\n\nAfter some hours we wake up and gaze out at the the stunning\
  \ view over the fjord, lit up by the Sun.\n\nSamuel takes us out for a walk through\
  \ Drangsnes, a tiny village in the Westfjords.\nWe meet Martha, the village school\
  \ teacher. \nShe teaches primary school aged kids who are growing up in the area.\n\
  \nLed by Martha we take a dirt road to the beach, made of black volcanic rocks,\
  \ like the rest of Iceland. \nThe waves are so quiet, they\u2019re the breath of\
  \ the cold ocean.\nWe go up the dirt road to come back to the village. \nWhile we\u2019\
  re walking Martha tells us a lot about these lands. \nShe talks about the strong\
  \ link between the Icelanders and wild nature, especially for those who live far\
  \ away from Reykjavik, the capital city.\nShe shows us a kind of flower and she\
  \ tells us how the inhabitants of the Westfjords use this flower to prepare a relaxing\
  \ herbal tea which they drink at bed time.\n\nEvery evening Paula and I go out to\
  \ pick these flowers. \nWe drink the infusion and watch the Sun sinking into the\
  \ smooth water of the fjord. \n\nThe connection we created with Icelandic Nature\
  \ was very deep.\nI felt as if we had been born and raised here, as if this place\
  \ had allowed us to understand a fundamental side of ourselves.\nThe simplicity\
  \ and the tranquillity of the life in this lost village showed me a completely different\
  \ way of living and being. \nIt\u2019s like I had finally found what I was looking\
  \ for.\nSo far from the unceasing traffic on the roads, made by cars that go so\
  \ fast driven by people who live so fast too, here everything is synchronised with\
  \ the rhythm of Nature.\n\nHere the only things that move fast are the cold wind\
  \ from the North and time. \nTime went by so fast that no sooner had I begun to\
  \ feel at home it was unfortunately already time to leave."
