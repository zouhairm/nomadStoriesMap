Text: "Have you ever had a feeling of reaching home at an unacquainted place? She\
  \ stood in the exact same place from where she has been directing us to reach the\
  \ homestay on the ever-fluctuating cellular network. The maps were not working,\
  \ the wide highway roads had narrowed down and the distant boulders were getting\
  \ closer and closer as we made our way to the place recommended to us by a complete\
  \ stranger. A humble abode for travelers like all of us, Bhavani G has been making\
  \ her place better for 20 years in Hampi. The warming sight of the rocky ruins and\
  \ the spiritual vibes of the town had definitely made a mark on the lady. The town\
  \ has something to offer to everyone, from a lazy sunbathing individual to a super\
  \ active bubble of energy, from a silence enjoying group to a bonfire loving travelers,\
  \ from a music lover to a music creator, everything and so does the lady. The first\
  \ greeting was the only time when the concept of meeting someone for the first time\
  \ crossed our mind, the following conversations never had an ounce of hesitancy.\
  \ Sitting exactly nowhere in the small town was the world which fascinates most\
  \ of us to visit Hampi and Bhavani G was a perfect personification of the place.\
  \ The fantasy of rocks and ruins, the carnival of intricate carvings and the gala\
  \ of cultural diversity was purely raw and refreshing. We often wonder how will\
  \ it be? Or shall we do this? But these thoughts are the pure outcome of the unknowns,\
  \ as we human beings are very careful in our strides. UNESCO identified world heritage\
  \ site, hippies paradise and an evidence of the brilliance that medieval people\
  \ possessed will strike you with a curiosity of a child. Unaware who we will meet,\
  \ how our little momentarily split-second decision will turn out was answered impeccably\
  \ with a broken language and a marvelous setting of the rocks around us. We didn\u2019\
  t expect that the overwrought and jittery feel will be sobered down by a comfortable\
  \ welcome by the place and its people.\u201CEK (one) SELFIE, OK! THANK YOU!\u201D\
  \ she said in a broken English pronunciation and a childish smile which purely beamed\
  \ with the expectation of visiting again, to which we obliged. The happy realization\
  \ of the people we meet and things we know are built on the experiences we have\
  \ had and the places we have traveled. The engined revved up again and the long\
  \ drive back with happy memories engraved, just like the carving on the rocks, started\
  \ to replay aptly complementing the Eddie Vedder\u2019s beautiful song \u201CSociety\u201D\
