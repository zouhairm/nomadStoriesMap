Text: "One of my earliest memories is learning about Peru. I was fascinated with the\
  \ story of the Incas and the pictures. When I finally had a chance to travel, my\
  \ first adventure was to trek along the Inca trail to Machu Picchu.\n\nAlthough\
  \ I traveled solo, I met up with the tour guide, Elkin, on my first day there. I\
  \ got to know him as we toured archeological sites such as Sacsayhuaman and the\
  \ Temple of the Sun.  He introduced me to Cusco and his world of narrow roads, llamas\
  \ and stray dogs, and markets filled with local merchandise. \n\nMore than that,\
  \ though, I learned about his family. Although his career as a tour guide took him\
  \ away from them for several days at a time, his family was extremely close-knit\
  \ and consisted of multiple generations - the complete opposite of mine. He worried\
  \ about his young daughter who was already determined to go to Lima, for females\
  \ there did not travel or live alone. It was an honor to alleviate some of his fears\
  \ about his daughter\u2019s independence as I shared with him my view of the world\
  \ and life experiences. \n\nWe met the rest of the group at the trailhead. As I\
  \ looked around at the groups of family members and friends, I began to feel alone\
  \ on this trip. Everybody was extremely friendly, but they were all sharing this\
  \ experience with a loved one.  I\u2019m an introvert, and being solitary in nature\
  \ is one of my most beloved joys.  But a spark of loneliness began at that moment,\
  \ although I didn\u2019t recognize it as such. Perhaps it had always been there.\
  \ \n\nWe trekked as a group on rain forest trails, up and down mountains, and through\
  \ small villages, exploring ruins along the way. The longer we trekked, the more\
  \ I separated myself from the group. I just wasn\u2019t interested in their constant\
  \ chatter about nothing.  The spark of loneliness grew until it burned in my chest.\n\
  \nIt was on the descent from Warmi Wa\xF1usqa (Dead Woman\u2019s Pass) that I paused\
  \ to reflect. I was out of earshot of any person on the planet. In the quietness,\
  \ I began to hear echoes of those long gone. I felt the laughter of children running\
  \ on the trail. I experienced the residue of so much joy and too much sorrow. Although\
  \ there was no other living human around, I was not isolated on that trail. \n\n\
  Peru reminded me that we are never truly alone. The Ancients are inside of us; we\
  \ can hear them if we know how to listen. The fire of loneliness was quenched as\
  \ I remembered that we are all related.  Our views of the world may differ, but\
  \ we are all inherently connected."
