Text: "The last rays of light paint the sparse clouds rosy while the gentle breeze\
  \ of winter comes and goes, like an idle wave. I spent the entire day hiking in\
  \ the Negev desert and am now walking back to the bus station. The surroundings\
  \ are quiet, only the muffled sound of my footsteps against the paved road is slicing\
  \ through the silence. A few meters ahead a masculine silhouette is cutting into\
  \ the sky, walking at the pace of a wanderer. \nAs I reach his level he turns an\
  \ affable face towards me: \n-\xAB Hey. Do you want a cup of coffee ? \xBB  he offers.\n\
  Used to traveling by myself, I usually make sure not to get into tricky situations,\
  \ I would have politely declined a boozy drink but I also like to follow my gut\
  \ instinct and the best encounters being the least expected ones, I answer : \n\
  -\xAB Sure, why not ? \xBB.\nWe find an off-road spot looking over the arid valley,\
  \ facing the sunset. He came to the desert to escape the scorching pain of a break-up\
  \ ; to be a few days alone with his thoughts, a sleeping bag and his drawing book.\
  \ \nHe takes out a compact water boiler and a small-sized pot. He presents me with\
  \ two plastic containers : one with ground coffee, the other filled with green leaves.\
  \ \n-\xAB Which one do you prefer ? \xBB.  I open the latter and inhale deeply :\
  \ green tea. \xAB This one !\xBB. \n\nI take a closer look at him: deep-blue eyes\
  \ with a melancholic gaze to them, his left arm is covered with funny tattoos. The\
  \ water is boiling. The wanderer then produces two tin-cups in which he pours the\
  \ fuming liquid. We enjoy the warm drink in silence. He speaks first, explaining\
  \ that this is a pakal cafe, an Israeli coffee kit commonly used in the army. He\
  \ just finished his military service and is now feeling anxious about the uncertainty\
  \ of his future. I can relate.\nThe notebook\u2019s corner reaching out of the bag\
  \ caught my eye, for I always carry one with me. \xAB I love to draw \xBB, he says\
  \ simply.  \nThe pages are darkened with airy shapes, others with only the thin\
  \ line of a figure. I can\u2019t help noticing that most drawings are of female\
  \ forms :\n-\xAB I like femininity, I find it tender and comforting\xBB. His drawing\
  \ reveals a beautiful sensitivity.\nThe sun will soon hide behind the sandy mountains.\
  \ \nI stand up to say goodbye to the stranger whose life I shared for an hour in\
  \ the midst of a timeless scenery. \n\nWe will probably never meet again. Or perhaps\
  \ we will. The unpredictability of the future is what makes life so interesting."
