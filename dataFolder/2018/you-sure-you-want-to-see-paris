Text: "When you come to another city you make connections not only with local people\
  \ but with the city itself. And some cities just don\u2019t let you go. A part of\
  \ them stays in your heart forever. For me, it was Paris. Every time I am there,\
  \ I learn it from a different side. Last time I was in Paris, it was pure magic.\n\
  Magical moments..How often do you feel them? How often do you realize that your\
  \ life is not just a routine but is an adventure? You just need to slow down a bit,\
  \ not to think too much about everyday problems, to stop your inner monologue for\
  \ some seconds and to enjoy\u2026 Paris helped me understand it. It made me wander\
  \ into a huge Catholic church just to see the interior and then to ask my French\
  \ friend to sit down for a couple of minutes..and it was magical. Huge beautiful\
  \ church, few people inside, the person who I am happy to have next to me..it was\
  \ one of the best moments and full of magic.\n\u2026Paris is bizarre. It is quite\
  \ noisy and busy at the daytime but you need to see it at night. Empty streets,\
  \ dim light, ghostly parks. Once I was walking with a friend after midnight, we\
  \ were wandering around the city, enjoying the silence, the ancient buildings; we\
  \ were breathing in the history itself. We passed by the Eiffel Tower, a huge lighthouse\
  \ over the Parisian sea, and found ourselves on a bridge. It was the pont de Bir-Hakeim\
  \ and I felt like it was out of place and time. The serene Seine was carrying its\
  \ waters into the eternity, Grenelle neighbourhood was faintly blinking in the distance.\
  \ My friend was smoking and I could not but take a puff to inhale the whole Parisian\
  \ night into my lungs, to become one with it\u2026 I do suggest everyone taking\
  \ a night walk in Paris! \n You say it is the States that make a melting pot of\
  \ cultures, I say it is Paris too. Here you can meet people of different nationalities,\
  \ tourists, workers, students, people like me who just came to the city thinking\
  \ it would meet them with a hug. You want to make connections. But the city is self-willed.\
  \ You come as one person, but it will make you different. How? Oh, Paris will find\
  \ ways to change you. Sometimes it is enough to just take a walk along its streets,\
  \ sometimes you have to get lost at night, but sometimes it will give you a person.\
  \ And then you understand that you are changing, but maybe you are just becoming\
  \ yourself..? Paris, its \xE2me will stay the same for the time being, but...what\
  \ about you?"
