Text: "The last thing I expected was to find freedom in a country that, during its\
  \ thousand-or-so year lifespan, has experienced so little of it. Before the first\
  \ world war, we ceased to exist for one hundred and twenty-three years. After the\
  \ second world war, we were once again forced under communist rule, this time for\
  \ almost half a century. \n\nPoland is still very much recovering from the years\
  \ of political abuse form our neighbours: Germans are still most commonly referred\
  \ to as the offensive \u2018szwaby\u2019; my grandad refuses to speak Russian, even\
  \ though he once had perfect command of it; our roads, although often leading to\
  \ beautiful places, tend to be ugly, uneven and frequently dangerous.   \n\nThe\
  \ roads I take, however, are enveloped by a mist of brown and green. Tree bark and\
  \ leaves become one as I gallop down long, winding paths that lead to nowhere. Western\
  \ Poland is a land of forest where, if you venture deep enough, there are no fresh\
  \ scars of history or organised religion to prejudice you. Only when travelling\
  \ at fifty kilometres an hour, potentially seconds away from dying, with the blood\
  \ of another creature coursing beneath your legs, your breath unable to escape your\
  \ lungs, can you truly lose yourself among the fresh, countryside air and greenery\
  \ surrounding you.\n\nWhere I come from, saddles and bridles and bits are about\
  \ as unheard of as spurs. Horses are tended to the natural, old-fashioned way \u2013\
  \ with kindness. They come running when you whistle and spend their time following\
  \ you around, nibbling your neck. Their whole body pulses with excitement when you\
  \ mount them. Nobody cares whether your elbow, hip and heel are in a straight line\
  \ while you ride or whether you have perfected the flying change. All that matters\
  \ is the ground below you and the path ahead.\n\nI come from a place where older\
  \ ladies attend mass every Sunday and spend their waking hours preaching about how\
  \ only God has the ability to judge, yet then shiver in anticipation to tell their\
  \ neighbours that they saw you kissing a boy goodbye on a park bench and shake their\
  \ head at how the younger generation has no shame.\n\nMy parents took me out of\
  \ this world at age five so that I could grow up free of the small-town mind-set\
  \ and measly opportunities I was destined to inherit. However, thirteen years later,\
  \ it is only here, between the acres of our beautiful forestland, that I truly feel\
  \ liberated."
