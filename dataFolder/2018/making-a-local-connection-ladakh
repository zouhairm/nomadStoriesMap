Text: "The experience begins since the arrival! In the summer time, from the New Delhi\
  \ Airport you can take a plane and it goes through the mountain range of Himalayas,\
  \ so the view is breathtaking!  The main city in Ladakh is Leh, the atmosphere is\
  \ very different from other cities of India, there are, mainly, two very different\
  \ cultural groups. The Tibetan descendants that are called Ladakhis, whom practice\
  \ Buddhism; and the  Kashmir people that practices muslim.  \nLadakh was a very\
  \ important place in the Tibetan Buddism expansion and you can perceive it instantly,\
  \ it is also called \u201CThe Small Tibet\u201D.  The peacefulness of Ladakhis is\
  \ very evident, they are a very calm and harmonius community. When you find someone\
  \ at the street, you say \u201CJULEY\u201D that is the way of saying \u201Chi\u201D\
  \ and everybody responds with a smile and a very energetic loudly happy voice \u201C\
  JULEEEEY\u201D,  it is a wonderful way to start every day!  \nThere is an interesting\
  \ contrast from Ladakhi people and the Indians from Cachemira, two cultures living\
  \ together with a lot of evident differences! What I could perceive from Cachemira\
  \ people is the deep look that characterizes them, they are very secure people,\
  \ very good for business, selling and negotiation. \nIn Ladakh you can see the old\
  \ way dressing traditions, is lovely to see the Ladakhi middle and old age people,\
  \ mostly, wearing with a lot of proud their traditional clothing and jewelry, is\
  \ like traveling back in time. \nWe rented a small truck to visit several old monasteries\
  \ that are in the surroundings of Leh. These monasteries have a wide collection\
  \ of Buddhist relics, like sculptures, murals, scriptures and thankas (paintings)\
  \ which enhance their magnificence. The most touching feel for me was that we were\
  \ visiting places of a culture that is live,  the monks actually practice there,\
  \ is not like going to other places where the culture has gone, is a very ancient\
  \ living culture , can you imagine! \nAnd finally, to finish our Ladakh experience,\
  \ we went to visit Tso moriri Lake. The scenery is beautiful, you can see the beautiful\
  \ clear rivers and the Jaks pastoring in the plains. At night, we stayed in a nomad\
  \ tend and we were hosted by local people, we ate a delicious traditional Tibetan-Ladackhi\
  \ soup, the weather was very very cold, but as their traditional customs, we were\
  \ all sitted around a fire singing traditional songs. The warmth of our hearts did\
  \ not allow us to feel the cold outside!"
