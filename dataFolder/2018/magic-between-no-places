Text: "Places that are not real places create the world we live in. Sites we can name,\
  \ but that exists as part more of the world than like places we can pinpoint.\n\n\
  I have visited one of such. A tianguis in Guadalajara, which like all of Mexico;\
  \ is full of new experiences. I was to meet with a friend at this site, to have\
  \ lunch together, but the day was about to become more than just lunch.\nI was ready\
  \ to take it all in, but no one ever counts on getting lost. The tianguis in its\
  \ own was big enough to walk for hours. Getting lost was not so surprising. If not\
  \ for the fact that a tianguis tends to go on a straight line; this tianguis had\
  \ so much life on its own that like a tree, it had branches in little streets at\
  \ the sides.\n\nGetting lost is on my experience one of the best ways to get to\
  \ know a place, and in this case, I learned a lot about Guadalajara by losing my\
  \ pat on the tianguis. Surprisingly I found that this no place had magic on it.\
  \ I found a line of street vendors selling books, new, old, used and unopened, each\
  \ more singular than the other; just like the people traveling along the stalls.\n\
  I decide to follow the flow of the streets and the people, see what else I could\
  \ see. That was another successful decision, I found the place where all the smells\
  \ were coming from. The gardening part of the tianguis that just like a big greenhouse,\
  \ was full of flowers, herbs, trees, and bushes of all kinds. This part was a completely\
  \ new universe. The colors and the smells reminding all how much life exist in the\
  \ world.\n\nMy favorite part was learning about the uses of some of this plants\
  \ and herbs; thanks to a nice old woman, ready to explain what we were seeing. \u201C\
  Plants are alive and can help you is you know how to ask them for what you need,\u201D\
  \ she said, completely sure of her words. I am willing to believe her if only for\
  \ how sure she sounded, and because of that part of me that believes in the magic\
  \ of the stories told by new people meet by a chance.\n\nMy path continued in the\
  \ same direction I came from, to maybe get back the where I have come from to go\
  \ to my meeting. Surely my friend was expecting me, to finally eat.\n\nHopefully\
  \ one day I will be able to go back and explore some more of the tianguis, and its\
  \ many characters. A magical place, meant to disappear in a few hours. A place of\
  \ transition, full of unexpected situations and many humans, capable of showing\
  \ an outsider how a no place is really a place so magical it can't exist forever,\
  \ but only in spare hours."
