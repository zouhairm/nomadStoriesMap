Text: "Nairobi confused me beyond comprehension and I couldn\u2019t help but feel\
  \ like an outsider trying to force her way into a crowded but content and close-knit\
  \ household until the most wonderful thing happened to me one day as I walked down\
  \ the crowded street. \u201CMajie aunty, majie,\u201D a young girl with a flaming\
  \ red tongue stopped me, pulling on my shirt gently and pointing to my hand. My\
  \ Swahili was rough and while I understood \u201Caunty\u201D right off the bat,\
  \ I struggled with the word \u201Cmajie.\u201D Water! It hit me suddenly. Of course,\
  \ water! The girl was thirsty and wanted some water. I was carrying a bottle of\
  \ water that I sipped from occasionally. I immediately gave her the water and while\
  \ she drank, I looked around to see who she belonged to. Kenya, like any other country,\
  \ has homeless children and the local word for any homeless person is jokora\u2014\
  mostly men and boys. As if she knew what I was thinking, the girl darted away to\
  \ where her mother was and sat next to her\u2014the rest of water gone in one sip.\
  \ Her mother was a peddler selling miscellaneous things. I walked away with the\
  \ lightest heart that day: something I\u2019d never expected had happened and I\
  \ was the only one who was baffled. That was why when the girl pointed to the water\
  \ bottle in my hand, I didn\u2019t think that majie might have meant water. I was\
  \ taught to never take drinks or food from strangers. \u201CYou never know what\
  \ disease they carry.\u201D For the first time in my life, I was \u201Cin\u201D\
  \ and not \u201Cout.\u201D On that day, the traditional African proverb rang true:\
  \ \u201Cit takes a village to raise a child.\u201D In Western societies, we teach\
  \ our children to \u201Cnever talk to strangers,\u201D because strangers might be\
  \ rapists, pedophiles, traffickers, etc. By doing that, we are placing responsibility\
  \ on such young and tender shoulders, already teaching them to distrust the world.\
  \ But Africa puts responsibility on the so called stranger that they must act right\
  \ towards children. That\u2019s why children fear and respect any elderly person.\
  \ The level of confidence and trust spoke volumes. I live for moments like that."
