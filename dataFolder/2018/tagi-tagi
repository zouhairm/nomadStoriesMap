Text: "For the tourist, Fiji is a tropical paradise where life is lived at a leisurely\
  \ pace and the locals are unceasingly friendly. But for all the idyllic scenes and\
  \ smiling faces, many Fijians live in poverty.\n\nI went to Fiji with a friend who\
  \ was born there but came to Australia, aged 14, to get an education, a career and\
  \ help support his family back home. It was 15 years since he was here. For me it\
  \ was the first time and, as we left the air-conditioned airport, the humidity hit\
  \ me like a hammer. I slumped in the back as we were driven along a sugarcane-flanked\
  \ road to Tagi-Tagi. It\u2019s not a village, just a locality. Corrugated iron in\
  \ a canefield. My friend\u2019s family greeted us, last but not least his mother\
  \ \u2013 her loving face, grace and tears-of-joy embrace required no introduction.\n\
  \nMy friend had painted a picture of poverty but instead I entered their home and\
  \ found myself watching rugby sevens on a flatscreen, and later a Bollywood movie\
  \ thanks to a new DVD player. But these mod cons were courtesy of my friend's hard\
  \ work in Australia, gifts to a grateful family. The house itself was built on the\
  \ blood, sweat and grimaces of backbreaking work in the canefield. Electricity was\
  \ restricted to four hours of generator power a night. The shower was a simple bucket;\
  \ the arm spraying the water mine and inefficient. And the toilet was filled manually\
  \ from a rainwater tank. All were novelties and fun for the short time I was here\
  \ but this is their life. This third-world theatre is their first and only world.\n\
  \nI felt uneasy as we were served dinner first, while his family sat and watched.\
  \ The fare was as rich as they were poor. And there was sugarcane and coconut straight\
  \ from the source, their immediacy somehow a shock to someone who\u2019d grown up\
  \ in a consumer society. These foods were processed solely by nature, not man. They\
  \ were wrapped in fibre, not plastic. Fresh, not frozen. And yet they were the most\
  \ foreign objects.\n\nBefore long, the generator shut down, the house fell silent.\
  \ I climbed under my mosquito net. All was quiet at first but soon a new form of\
  \ electricity was generated around me. Mosquitoes hummed and geckos clicked in their\
  \ ancient languages, and I felt the contradictions fade away. Lying there, I was\
  \ transported to a place where poverty and modernity did not exist. Only humidity."
