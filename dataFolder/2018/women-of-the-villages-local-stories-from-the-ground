Text: "I have felt lost for most part of my conscious life and as ironic as it sounds\
  \ I also found myself at the same time. Travelling is that art that has made me\
  \ feel comfortable in my skin and be proud of who I have become, in sickness or\
  \ in health. The most important thing that travelling has taught me is the art of\
  \ reflection and writing.  While travelling in the villages of Jharkhand in India\
  \ I lived with a few tribal women and  documented some stories of women along the\
  \ way, this is one such story. \n\nIn Rani Dih village of Boarijore block, Mai Bitti\
  \ is one of the youngest wives of Ramlal Murmu, the carpenter. She met him 3 years\
  \ ago in her village and says that she was attracted to him and eventually started\
  \ loving the man. According to her, Ramlal approached her and asked her hand for\
  \ marriage and in Santhali Culture it is well known that many times women join their\
  \ husband\u2019s house before marriage which today is also known as a live-in relationship.\
  \ It is said that this culture gives enough ground for women to fall in love and\
  \ decide who they wish to marry, though the reality still oppresses women however\
  \ much the freedom she idealistically would enjoy. She soon shifted to her husband\u2019\
  s house and upon arriving she met two other wives of Ramlal ,though she was unaware\
  \ of their existence she says she wasn\u2019t as shocked as she should have been\
  \ because she has grown up seeing men bringing more than one wives in her birth\
  \ village as well. She continued to live with her husband and his other two wives,\
  \ her husband\u2019s two brothers and their wives and their children and even her\
  \ husband had 3 children from his other wives. It was a family with 22 members including\
  \ her.  She gave birth to a son with her husband last year and now this feeling\
  \ of insecurity is getting strengthened. She feels betrayed and also being the youngest\
  \ sometimes even the other wives of her husband tent to ignore her. Though she accepted\
  \ that somewhere the other wives of her husband have also accepted her and each\
  \ other and they try their very best to exist in harmony. She says, sometimes the\
  \ days go by in a blink of an eye and it seems to be normal. She accepts that for\
  \ a woman, it is a duty to serve her husband and therefore they as a woman have\
  \ normalized with the irregularities of the society. She said \u201CMy mother taught\
  \ me to always be loyal to my husband, but she never told me if my husband too will\
  \ be loyal to me or not\u201D. There are multiple such realities."
