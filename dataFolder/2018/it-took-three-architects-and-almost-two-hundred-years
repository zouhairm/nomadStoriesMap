Text: "A place that is in constant friction with paradoxical realities. A perfectly\
  \ constructed chaos. \n\nThis is my impression of Italy which case in point always\
  \ catapults in over the top gesticulative descriptions of the local food. \nTwo\
  \ weeks ago I had arrived in Florence after a gruelling bus ride that took more\
  \ than twenty-four hours, crossing four borders and passing through a year's worth\
  \ of seasonal changes. Sometimes the most fulfiling experiences are felt going through\
  \ some hardship, just like it takes a cold day to appreciate the joy of a hot shower\
  \ it took some getting used to knowing Florence.\n\nNo longer was I foreign to the\
  \ energy and the turbulent currents of the city, I had become accustomed in navigating\
  \ places with much assertiveness but if you are deliberately cutting in line, accented\
  \ underlying tones of brashness. Filled, swarmed, engulfed with tourists, the trivial\
  \ act of getting coffee requires more effort than it should. It is always an exhilarating\
  \ feeling as you wobble out of a cafe, overtaken by a rush of adrenaline the first\
  \ task of the day is more or so a celebratory event that you still have all of your\
  \ limbs. A guiding element in comprehending the weight of the city's history was\
  \ my copy of Michaelangelo's biography -where I had marked and highlighted street\
  \ names and locations that he had been -  took me through the empty narrow paved\
  \ streets that more than once lead me to a dead end, other times lead me to the\
  \ uproar of the Ponte Vecchio bridge and  across the other side It would take me\
  \ to my safe haven in form of a sunbathing plateau; Piazza Pitti. My last destination\
  \ before retiring my scavenger hunt would be sitting on a bench overlooking the\
  \ Duomo and observing many situations unfold without crashing into one another.\
  \ Time stood still when passing through the Duomo, as you can't help but romanticize\
  \ its features; the marble blocks with geometric patterns, the grand cupola and\
  \ clean cut windows are tangible evidence of a formal love letter to the city. More\
  \ so, a letter that took writing and re-writing for almost two hundred years.\n\n\
  It is apparent in every place the innate intricacy to detail and profound passion\
  \ devoted to building and preserving Florence. A time capsule. The book allowed\
  \ me to travel to another era but it didn't take much imagination to picture the\
  \ city as it is still the same; persistent and demanding as ever."
