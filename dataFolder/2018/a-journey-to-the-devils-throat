Text: "Traveling is the most beautiful memories we can make, especially when you travel\
  \ with someone you love!\nMy mum moved to Argentina when I was 18 so we don't see\
  \ each other that often, that's why we decided to go on a road trip together.\n\
  In January 2016, I got into a flight to Buenos Aires, and then jumped on a bus to\
  \ Rosario, I remember my heart beating faster as I grew closer to the destination\
  \ with the thought of seeing my mum after so long.\nThe encounter was beautiful\
  \ and emotional. At 2am we boarded the bus that was our ride for the next 9 days,\
  \ it was full of locals and they were so welcoming.\nI woke up by dawn to a beautiful\
  \ landscape kissed by the first rays of sunshine, we were in Misiones, where we\
  \ had breakfast in a  pretty tent-like cafe before heading to our first adventure,\
  \ The Ruins Of San Ignacio Mini.\nWhen we got off the bus a 7-year-old and his little\
  \ 3-year-old brother were asking us for some food, that broke my heart. As a Londoner\
  \ sadly I am used to beggars asking for cash but I had never been approached by\
  \ kids alone, just asking for food. I opened my bag and gave them all the food I\
  \ had for the rest of the day, and their reaction was priceless, and I can still\
  \ see the happiness on their faces as I write this.\nThe ruins were magnificent\
  \ and well preserved, the mines of Wanda, another beautiful stop where we learned\
  \ how they extract minerals from the earth.The best part of the trip started when\
  \ we arrived at Iguazu.We visited both the Brazilian an Argentinian side of the\
  \ park where we saw some waterfalls and we rode a boat through the river.In the\
  \ Argentinian side, the views were STUNNING.Last stop was\u201CThe Devils Throat\u201D\
  \ which is a horseshoe-shaped 80m jump. Tones of water drop into the river creating\
  \ a foggy atmosphere, there's always a rainbow in there.\nThat day I met a Guarani\
  \ boy (the local tribe)that told me a legend;he said the waterfalls were made by\
  \ the devil as an act of jealousy of a Guarani prince and princess love, he cursed\
  \ and separated them by turning her into a waterfall and him into a tree that lies\
  \ near the waterfall, the legend says they managed to break the curse through a\
  \ rainbow that shows up every day at the devils throat and reunites them.\nThe whole\
  \ trip was amazing and I saw beautiful and unforgettable things but what made the\
  \ best memories is the people that I met along; all my road trip comrades which\
  \ I am still in touch with, the local people that touched my heart with stories,\
  \ and of course my beloved mother."
