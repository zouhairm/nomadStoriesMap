Text: "Making, breaking, mending and then repeat, so far I have met these phases mostly\
  \ in experiences. Experiences whose even shadow was not thought of facing. I guess\
  \ solo trips teach such lessons at its best. My first solo one to Arunachal Pradesh\
  \ left and led me to explore, learn about nature, people and myself in a new context.\
  \ I met nature here in the most genuine and organic form. My deepest local connection\
  \ was made with Namsai\u2019s evenings, sky, the deliciously simple foods, sunrises-sunsets,\
  \ birds, rainbows, snow capped mountains, wildflowers, the beautifully sculptured\
  \ monuments and dharamshalas of the Buddhist monks.These were my heroes who broke\
  \ the mundane working routine of the whole day. A small town name Namsai in Arunachal\
  \ Pradesh, here I spent three months amidst of different but the most blessed place.\n\
  If I were to write a letter to the all these heartfelt things. It would be an endless\
  \ thank you note to the sky of every evening and the sunset, to the clouds that\
  \ created waves scattering the colorful rays of the sun that every corner of my\
  \ eyes could reach to. Thank god, I had a camera to capture such a sight and share\
  \ these moments with rest of my world. Even looking at it now brings back my all\
  \ the positive vibes and strength. Never to forget the bright rays of the mornings\
  \ and I would send the warmest hug to the snow-capped mountains. These mountains\
  \ had me in love at \u2018first sight\u2019, scaling up to touch my sky of love.\
  \ The lucky birds flying in the sky are another flock of beauty. The pattern made\
  \ on their way back home on every evening sky is the most perfect and eyes soothing\
  \ picture.\nHow nature can steal away part of you had me realize much more now.\
  \ I know that a part of my soul is left behind looking out at the wildflowers,listening\
  \ to the giggles of the teenagers, getting the pleasant goose bumps by the gentle\
  \ cold evening breeze, breathing in the freshness, peace in the dharamshala, fishing\
  \ around the marketplace and thinking what to buy and what not, smelling and tasting\
  \ the simple local cuisine and a smile that greeted in the conversations with the\
  \ humble strangers. It is now a fact of my life, that till the last blink of my\
  \ eyes and till the last drop of blood pumping, this friendship is to stay. \nTraveling\
  \ gives the opportunity to fall in love with nature again and again. I hope to visit\
  \ another part of Arunachal Pradesh soon, warping myself in your arms and smiling\
  \ broad on uniting again with my permanent local connection, nature!"
