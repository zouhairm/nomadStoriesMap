Text: "I have been to England before, when I was 17 - which was life changing in both\
  \ good but surprisingly also bad ways - so this second trip in 2010 was not supposed\
  \ to be about new discoveries but visiting vaguely familiar places. Going with my\
  \ mom and brother we were travelling to London, Paris, and Rome. We had all been\
  \ to Rome and Paris before but they hadn't been to London yet.\nAll I really cared\
  \ to see was the Tate, the Natural History Museum (a beloved haunt on my first trip),\
  \ and the independent publishing house and store Persephone Books. For some now\
  \ trivial reason, I had also gotten it into my head to go visit a ninjutsu class.\
  \ Yes, I was literally going to be in town for 3 days, but I just knew I had to\
  \ go. Around 7pm that first night we were in London, after a google search, I chanced\
  \ upon a class that was going on that very night but was far from our hotel, in\
  \ Camden Town. I was late: wearing carefully done make-up, messy curls, baggy, ripped\
  \ jeans, a short faux fur leopard coat, new shoes that were too small and ripping\
  \ the skin on my feet, and carrying a Hello Kitty messenger bag. Whatever. \nI slipped\
  \ out of my shoes and entered, where an instructor met me and showed me to some\
  \ seats along the wall where I could sit and watch. Walking over some guy who was\
  \ already sitting there smiled at me with what I would now call interest. We spoke\
  \ a bit but mostly I was just trying to watch and when he asked me if I wanted to\
  \ practice I said no. I knew I couldn't stay for the whole class and when 9 (or\
  \ was it 10?) pm rolled around I just turned to him, said bye and smiled. Now, as\
  \ a Canadian we're nice, but I have a tendency to smile without realising it. He\
  \ took this the wrong way and asked if I wanted to get a drink. Normally I would\
  \ say no as I don't date, but something made me go \"OK.\" We ended up walking and\
  \ talking and the guy, Mark, told me he had a motorcycle and that he would give\
  \ me a ride. \nYes, I did the thing you're not supposed to do and went to his underground\
  \ garage, hopped on the back of his bike, and didn't tell my mom where I was going.\
  \ London at night is beautiful, but London on my very first motorcycle ride was\
  \ even more amazing, despite not actually being able to see much detail. At the\
  \ end of the ride, he drove me to my waiting (and pissed off) mother and we arranged\
  \ to meet again the next night.\nThis was nearly 8 years ago, and I sit here in\
  \ mine and Mark's living room in Canada typing up the story of the weird way I met\
  \ my husband."
