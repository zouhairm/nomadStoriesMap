Text: "When I meet a Mexican college student named Jorge and discover he speaks flawless\
  \ English, I feel the urgent need to talk with him. About everything. I can\u2019\
  t remember the last time I felt so much happiness in simply having somebody understand\
  \ me.\n\nAfter several days in central Mexico I\u2019ve discovered that just because\
  \ English and Spanish share hundreds of cognates doesn\u2019t mean I can, for instance,\
  \ ask how to use the @ symbol on the internet cafe computer keyboard. I\u2019ve\
  \ been mired in my own inability to speak Spanish, self-consciously restricting\
  \ each conversational exchange, knowing even the simplest of questions will elicit\
  \ responses I probably won\u2019t understand.\n\nBut this young undergraduate gives\
  \ me my voice back, and the floodgates open. The momentum of words startles even\
  \ me. Seriously, I can\u2019t shut up. I deluge him with questions about his coursework\
  \ in Modern Languages at La Salle University in Le\xF3n, where in addition to his\
  \ native Spanish he is studying English, Italian, French, and German. When Jorge\
  \ explains he wants to translate literature one day, I babble about the various\
  \ English translations of Homer\u2019s Iliad, and speculate on what it would be\
  \ like to read Don Quixote in the original Spanish. Jorge shares my enthusiasm for\
  \ Cervantes\u2019 novel. \u201CSancho Panza is such a tender character,\u201D he\
  \ tells me. \u201CHe is so loyal.\u201D \n\nI spend a lot of time with 18- to 22-year-old\
  \ university students. Since the college where I work in central Kansas has a tiny\
  \ English department, I teach a broad mix of classes\u2014from American literature\
  \ to Western World literature, first-year composition to Literary Criticism. Some\
  \ English majors take six or seven classes from me. This means I get to watch their\
  \ writing develop over the course of three to four years, and introduce them to\
  \ the writers who move me most: Herman Melville, Wendell Berry, Homer, Toni Morrison,\
  \ Annie Dillard, Frederick Douglass, Leslie Marmon Silko, Tim O\u2019Brien. Sometimes\
  \ my students and I travel together on literary field trips; other times I take\
  \ them camping. By the time they graduate, I find our shared project has not been\
  \ merely intellectual\u2014it has been emotional as well."
