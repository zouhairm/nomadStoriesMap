Text: "I have always loved old architecture. Since I was a kid, I used to spend hours\
  \ watching ancient buildings. I simply adore the detailed designs of paintings and\
  \ amazing woodwork from the past.\nIn my home country, Egypt, I like to walk down\
  \ the old streets to view the buildings around. I live in a quiet neighborhood called\
  \ \u201CHeliopolis\u201D. Loving historical places, visiting Italy was always a\
  \ dream. I have asked a friend of mine if she would like to join me to visit this\
  \ beautiful country. She accepted, but her motive was a little bit different from\
  \ mine. She suggested meeting old friends living there, and I was excited about\
  \ it. We backed our bags and started with Rome, we spent three days in Rome to visit\
  \ Colosseum, Vatican, and other beautiful attractions.\nWe headed to Turin to visit\
  \ our old friends. They recommended visiting Verona. A city I have only heard of\
  \ in Shakespeare\u2019 s masterpiece : Romeo and Juliet. We bought the tickets and\
  \ headed to Verona very early in the morning. I fell in love with this historical\
  \ city. I wondered how I always thought it was a fairy city that has never existed.\
  \ I was so wrong. The city if very real and full of life.\nThe first thing we visited\
  \ there was \u201CCasa di Giulietta\u201D. Italians say that this might be the house\
  \ of Juliet the real heroin of Romeo and Juliet tragedy.  In this historical spot,\
  \ we found a lot of tourists coming from everywhere just to see this beautiful place\
  \ and have a photo with Juliet\u2019s statue for good luck. I notice a young Italian\
  \ girl about 14 years old, who looked exactly like my niece Aliaa. She even have\
  \ the same hair color and style. The girl was with her parents buying souvenirs\
  \ and taking pictures. I had some courage and went to start speaking with this beautiful\
  \ family. I introduced myself and told them that I noticed a weird resemblance \
  \ between their daughter and my niece. I even showed them my niece\u2019s photo\
  \ on my mobile. They were astonished too. We had a small chatting, they told me\
  \ that they live in another city in Italy, and it was the first time for them to\
  \ visit Verona. We wondered if we are really related. Egypt and Italy had ancient\
  \ relations starting Cleopatra and Antonio. Therefore, maybe we are far cousins\
  \ or something. Can this be true!"
