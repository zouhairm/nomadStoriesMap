Text: "It\u2019s a heavenly morning. I\u2019m sitting at a table overlooking the town\
  \ of Cusco. Tomorrow is my first day of high altitude trekking and I can\u2019t\
  \ wait. I\u2019m blissfully unaware of the trauma that waits.The next morning starts\
  \ early. I roll over in the dark and as I swallow, I\u2019m engulfed in panic. My\
  \ throat feels like it is lined with hot razor blades.\nThis cannot be good.\nHow\
  \ can I embark upon a strenuous trek in the Andes when I can\u2019t swallow? I\u2019\
  m dizzy and weak. Should I just climb back into bed? Then I remember the months\
  \ of planning and saving for this once in a lifetime chance. Can I really give that\
  \ up because of a cold? So,I don\u2019t let on that I\u2019m sick, fearing they\
  \ will turn me away. I know now there\u2019s a reason they turn sick people away\
  \ from these treks. At altitude, a chest cold can become life threatening very quickly.Over\
  \ the next few days my condition deteriorates. I have a constant rattle in my chest\
  \ and my back aches.We eventually reach the foot of the glacier. Stunning as it\
  \ is, all I want to do is sleep. \nIt\u2019s getting hard to talk now. At one point\
  \ while resting, an enormous wracking cough takes hold of me. My chest hurts. Green\
  \ phlegm erupts from my mouth. This horrendous spasm continues for a number of minutes.\n\
  The group has gone silent and everyone is staring at me. \u201CWe need to look at\
  \ you\u201D says Liz, an ER doctor who\u2019s part of the group. After examining\
  \ me, she explains it is dangerous to continue. Devastated, I beg her to let me\
  \ stay. One of the Sherpa\u2019s pulls out a crumpled box of antibiotics and we\
  \ agree to see if these can make a difference. If there\u2019s no improvement in\
  \ 24hours, I will be joining the llama on the way down.\nI know in my heart I can\
  \ do this.\nOver the next 2 days, my improvement is remarkable. I can hold a conversation\
  \ without collapsing and my throat feels better. We arrive at one of the more beautiful\
  \ campsites along the way. We gather for a meal and it\u2019s the first night since\
  \ we started walking that I have been able to finish my dinner with the group. \n\
  I step out to watch the sunset. At this altitude, we are literally above the clouds.\
  \ The sunset makes the clouds glow with a splendid blend of pink and orange. It\u2019\
  s almost surreal. It\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before.\nThen it hits\
  \ me. I could have missed this moment.\nHad I had a weaker state of mind or had\
  \ I given up when they said to, I would have missed out on this moment. \nI feel\
  \ an immense sense of pride. I would have never known my real limits had I not pushed\
  \ myself to the edge"
