Text: "One morning I woke up in a town I had lived in for two years to go to a job\
  \ I hated and I just decided \"enough\". I took a massive leap of faith. Packed\
  \ my belongings and headed way out west from the small town of Maryborough, Victoria.\
  \ I wanted something different and found myself adamant about moving to Kings Canyon\
  \ in the middle of the Australian desert, by myself. There was a population of 40\
  \ others when I arrived, one shop, one bar, and one fortnightly truck to get us\
  \ all by. Not to mention the insane heat. I was blessed with an amazing small community\
  \ of fellow hard workers, it didn't take me long to see we were all in the same\
  \ boat. \n\nThe local Aboriginals although not living in staff village were extremely\
  \ accommodating and welcoming of us, I learned so much about the history of their\
  \ people and their culture and was dumb founded at my lack of knowledge of the indigenous.\
  \ We learned about the genocide of the Tasmanian aboriginals after the first fleet\
  \ and the pain in their eyes as they told the story of their fallen ancestors. The\
  \ taught us how they hunt and how they made their food, we learned how to paint\
  \ and understand their symbols and what their paintings were saying. They allowed\
  \ us to climb Ayers Rock in Uluru, a sacred land to them. We crafted spears and\
  \ were taught that how to use them. They taught us to make fire and how to live\
  \ off the land, they humbled us.\n\nThere are some fantastic experiences to behold\
  \ at Kings Canyon, such as the Canyon Rim Walk. 500 plus steps to the most amazing\
  \ view you'll ever see, the rim walk in my opinion is near enough as good as the\
  \ Grand Canyon. My favorite part though? Amongst the red nothingness, when the sun\
  \ set, all you would see was a sky full of stars, I've never been so inlove with\
  \ the sky. I was so proud to be about of this experience for so many others.\n\n\
  Moving to rural Australia and exploring the outback will always be a heartfelt experience\
  \ for me. To walk out of your room clean every day to coming home covered in red\
  \ dirt. The local dingoes following you around hoping for a bit of love to the few\
  \ and far in between kangaroos avoiding you like the mad. One thing to never do\
  \ is leave your doors and windows open unless you don't mind snakes and spiders\
  \ as roommates, me personally? Wasn't a fan.\n\nThe lessons I learned in Kings Canyon\
  \ will stay with me for a long time and my memories of the local communities. I\
  \ feel privileged to have been given this local connection to a beautifully spiritual\
  \ place."
