Text: "I wanted to see Argentina for quite sometime now. I was desperate and would\
  \ do anything just to visit the land of gauchos and tango. Until I came across an\
  \ advertisement that advertised; \"Win a trip to Argentina\" I entered my information\
  \ in. I did not think I would win. However I was wrong. Much to my shock I had won.\
  \ This was the start of an adventure of a life time. After weeks of preparation\
  \ it was time to head out all by myself to a country full of infused culture and\
  \ charm. After boarding the first with a stop over and boarding another plane I\
  \ was close. The next morning I arrived. As I cleared customs I was taken to my\
  \ hotel in a taxi, the European influence could be seen through out Buenos Aires.\
  \ It didn't feel like Paris or Barcelona but a place of its very own. Much to my\
  \ surprise to my surprise I was about to meet people who had a quality personality\
  \ to them, they I would like to keep as friends. From the taxi driver who gave me\
  \ suggestions of things to do to the warm greeting of the hotel staff. I wanted\
  \ to meet some people and make friends so I decided to use the app Whisper to reach\
  \ out to people. To my surprise people started messaging me offering their assistance\
  \ to me. I meet up with a few at a local caf\xE9. My social anxiety started getting\
  \ the best of me until one person told me that they were not here to judge me and\
  \ a moment of relief helped. I started a conversation as I normally would when getting\
  \ to know a person. Soon I found common interests with my new friends. I was no\
  \ longer quiet and introverted. I had become the extrovert to them. After we finished\
  \ our meal they took me to the Recoleta Cemetery truly a gorgeous cemetery. I had\
  \ never seen a cemetery that beautiful in my life. Quiet and dedicated to the deceased\
  \ who lie there. It was as if the dead had a city of their own. The most visited\
  \ site of the cemetery happened to be the tomb of no other than Eva Pero\u0144.\
  \ Well kept with flowers laid for her. I was impressed so far with Buenos Aires\
  \ and how much it offers to people. After finishing up I asked my new friends if\
  \ there was a good place to buy suveniors and send back home to friends and family.\
  \ Considering my question we decided to head over to the San Telmo street fair where\
  \ I was exposed to the culture. So much culture in one place. But the greatest part\
  \ of the San Telmo street fair were the tango dancers. A dance so pationate that\
  \ couples us it as a form of expressing love to one another."
