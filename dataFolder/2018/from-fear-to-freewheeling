Text: "\u2018I wish to be free from fear\u2019: these were the words I heard as I\
  \ watched the world go by on the coach to the airport on a drizzly December morning.\
  \ I was listening to a podcast in a somewhat belated attempt to reignite my high\
  \ school Spanish before I landed at my destination in Chile in 40 hours\u2019 time.\
  \ Those words resonated with me, and my sense of Now sharpened. For the past few\
  \ weeks I had been tormented by a fear that caused me to lie awake on full alert,\
  \ my brain whirring with thoughts of all the bad things that might happen in an\
  \ unknown place. Chile was that unknown place, and I was about to embark on a 500km\
  \ cycle tour, with someone I had only met once before in a remote cottage in Scotland\
  \ two months earlier. Two girls, two bikes, two bags each containing all our possessions,\
  \ a tent and 500km of gravel road. The Carretera Austral beckoned: a road that runs\
  \ through the heart of Patagonia. \n\nAnd yet I felt no fear as we pushed off on\
  \ the first day, learning to balance our heavy bikes against the prevailing wind.\
  \ Somehow, the fear had lost its grip in transit, and once on the road had been\
  \ replaced by freedom. We traversed the patchwork plains where the air smelt sweet,\
  \ like jasmine, and the fields, forests, and skies were filled with unfamiliar birds.\
  \ Fear and freedom are opposite sides of the same coin, and as we turned towards\
  \ the mountains my freedom felt boundless.\n\nOver the 10 days and 30,000ft of height\
  \ gain, we experienced Patagonia as if it were a (rather bumpy) pedal-powered reel\
  \ of film. The Carretera Austral demands everything from you; endless hills, gravel\
  \ roads like corrugated iron, winds of 80km an hour, sunshine, rain, blizzards,\
  \ but you will be richly rewarded for your efforts. The quiet and isolated road\
  \ winds through scenery that transforms itself from cool rainforest valleys with\
  \ slow wet clouds rising, to sun-baked rolling hills, to snow-capped mountains with\
  \ glaciers bulging over precipices like pennies in a slot machine. In the still\
  \ evenings, the flooded marsh valleys ring out with the sound of thousands of frogs,\
  \ their croaks like squelching popping candy. Out in these wild places with only\
  \ my bike, my friend, and a few possessions, my fear had no home. \n\nI think back\
  \ to before the trip and how close I felt to the edge of my known limits, but that\u2019\
  s all they were: my known limits. A trip like this takes you to the edge then shows\
  \ you that that\u2019s where the adventure begins."
