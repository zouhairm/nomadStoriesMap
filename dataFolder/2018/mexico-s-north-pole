Text: "\u201CI only work when I\u2019m happy,\u201D Jos\xE9 announces. Leaning back\
  \ in a plastic lawn chair, he speaks with a cigarette permanently dangling from\
  \ his mouth, the sleeve of his fleece stained with pink sparkles. The front patio\
  \ of Jos\xE9\u2019s home/workshop is decorated year-round for Christmas, hosting\
  \ a vast selection of artisan glass spheres for sale. In musical Spanish, he adds,\
  \ \u201COnce I was angry and made ornaments that never sold. There\u2019s energy\
  \ to them, you know?\u201D \n\nLocated a few hours from Mexico City, the rugged,\
  \ ex-mining village of Tlapujahua is connected to the world by one twisting highway.\
  \ With fewer than 4000 residents, it hosts the largest blown-glass Christmas ornament\
  \ making business in Latin America, with 150 home-based factories, like Jos\xE9\u2019\
  s shop. There\u2019s also a gorgeous market full of locally made ornaments\u2014\
  all glass. If it seems like a lovely, yet problematic place to visit with five small\
  \ kids, you\u2019re right. \n\n\u201CFortunately, I\u2019m usually happy,\u201D\
  \ Jos\xE9 says. The kids are rabbling through the baskets of glass ornaments for\
  \ sale, and I\u2019m torn between admiring the products and trying to keep them\
  \ intact. \u201CBut, the real magic is lining the ornaments with silver,\u201D Jos\xE9\
  \ enthuses as he explains the process of his craft. The kids sit on the tiled floor\
  \ to listen and I exhale. He offers to show us how he silvers the glass spheres\
  \ and we troop upstairs to the workspace, where the gas burner roars to heat the\
  \ silver nitrate. The floor is aglitter with spilled glue and sparkles, cluttered\
  \ with boxes, paint, and glass. Downstairs, after touching most everything in the\
  \ shop, the kids cradle their ornaments which Jos\xE9 boxes up, and somehow, now\
  \ we have to get them home in one piece.\n\nAcross the street in a tiny plaza, fake\
  \ snow explodes in gusts of air from machines. We are surrounded by Bavarian cottages,\
  \ complete with pretzel-and-beer vendors in the cool, pine air. The kids run amok\
  \ in the flittering flakes, yelling as only kids who have never seen snow before\
  \ will do. This town is undoubtedly unique. \n\nBeyond the glitzy glow of its endless\
  \ Christmas and fake snow, Tlapujahua specializes in mini works of art. Each ornament\
  \ is hand-painted and slightly different from all the others, unique as the mostly\
  \ happy individuals who make them. The only casualty of our visit is the sphere\
  \ my husband broke when Jos\xE9 insisted he try silvering too. \u201CNo problem!\u201D\
  \ Jos\xE9 says, cheerfully smashing the broken pieces further, in a box full of\
  \ shattered glass. \u201CFun, isn\u2019t it?\u201D He grins."
