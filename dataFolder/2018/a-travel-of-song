Text: "Cape Town hasn't rained in months.  The heat defies all English adjectives.\
  \ Tonight, I decide \u2013 after much tossing \u2013 to go up to the rooftop to\
  \ cool down. I take a bottle of water, lighter and cigarette; unaware that I am\
  \ preparing for a journey I will soon take. The flights of stairs lead me to the\
  \ rooftop. I swing the door open and immediately feel the cool, moist air giving\
  \ me a welcoming embrace. Sadly, nothing is visually appealing, just sky-scraping\
  \ buildings of the city hindering my view to the beautiful Table Mountain. To my\
  \ right, parliament South Africa with its colonial symbolism stares. Just as I light\
  \ my cigarette I am joined by a companion. I smile, she smiles back. This is the\
  \ kind of company I do not mind. I do not know her name and still don\u2019t, but\
  \ that was irrelevant to the rooftop moments we share in the wee hours of the morning\
  \ for a smoke. \u2018Can't sleep?\u2019 she asks. Up until this moment, we had never\
  \ exchanged any words to each other, except an acknowledging nod. \u2018Yes, it's\
  \ unbearable\u2019 I say. We sit in silence, each smoking. The silence between us\
  \ is comprehensively light yet comfortable. She plays Hugh Masekela's 'Stimela'\
  \ on her phone. Within seconds the saxophone envelopes us in a soothing, ethereal\
  \ and nostalgic fashion. I must have impulsively hummed because she too realized\
  \ the chords connected us, so she increased the volume. \n\n\u201CYou know this\
  \ song takes me home. Every time I hear it, I board this imaginary train Hugh is\
  \ singing about and I am home\u201D shares my companion. It is the mid 90\u2019\
  s. The smell of the apartheid era is nearly forgotten, replaced by a new fragrance,\
  \ one of a fresh future, hope; the kind made of Mandela\u2019s dreams.  Sakuba Street\
  \ is humming with activity. It is Christmas and Zwide would not be a township if\
  \ not for the car wash music, kids roaming the streets with fresh haircuts and styles,\
  \ adults wrapped up in doeks and kangas, arms deep in cooking and cleaning.  The\
  \ spirit is airborne. I feel it and I am there with my companion; the joy and innocence\
  \ of childhood. The song plays in the background and her uncle shuffles his feet\
  \ talking about his old jazz days; days when his dreams of becoming a guitarist\
  \ were unclouded by life and all things politics. It is a wonderful day to be alive,\
  \ for freedom is here. You can\u2019t see it. It\u2019s like laughter. The last\
  \ thing I ever expected was to be musically teleported. All it took was one song,\
  \ the silence of the night for me to travel into the memory of another human being."
