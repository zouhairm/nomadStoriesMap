Text: "The sparkle of the morning frost greeted us as the crisp air raced into my\
  \ nostrils. I took my first breath of the Slovakian air as we embarked on what was\
  \ to be the most enchanting yet terrifying day of my life.\n\nThe first three hours\
  \ led us up serpent like paths covered in small grey rocks. With smiling eyes, we\
  \ passed others who had roamed the mountain.\n \nAlong the way our pauses allowed\
  \ us to breathe in the coloured beauty of the unfamiliar territory. The cuspate\
  \ pines had a gentle sway and an array wild flowers danced at our feet with a sweet\
  \ hum. As I tilted my face towards the teal sky, allowed my eyelids to close and\
  \ drank in the sun that kissed my skin.\n\nWhen we reached the summit I felt a sense\
  \ of bright achievement. Little did I know the hardest peaks and snow-covered edges\
  \ were yet come. \nChildren and dogs scurried past us, some tied to their parents\
  \ with rope. Seeing this lulled me into a false sense of safety.\n\nAfter balancing\
  \ on rocks and climbing icy slopes I assumed the worst was over. Several hours in,\
  \ the terror in my body began climbing at a rapid rate. There was a rock ledge just\
  \ 20cm wide with a sheer drop. The only safety- a cold and slippery chain. Involuntarily\
  \ my hands began to tremble and silvery water lined my eyes. Usually I was fearless\
  \ but in this moment I was raw, open and vulnerable. I had not known this fear before,\
  \ but I did it.\n\nGolden wisps of grass bounced in the fullness of the thundering\
  \ winds. In a swift second those golden threads turned into what felt like moving\
  \ honey beneath my feet and I was hurtling towards a cliff edge. My partner caught\
  \ me just as I thought my heart was going to projectile out of my mouth. \n\nAfter\
  \ 7 long fragile and enormous hours we reached the summit. I gazed at the absolutely\
  \ incredible view that resembled a fantasy painting from another planet. It was\
  \ nature that made you gasp from the intense beauty that drenched your soul. I flared\
  \ my nostrils and breathed in to completely fill my lungs. It was one of those moments\
  \ where for a brief window you need to decipher if you're dreaming or is this your\
  \ reality? A surreal mixture of succulent smells-Ice, rain and sunshine mixed with\
  \ the buzz of voices randomly drowned out by gusts that were so sharp you could\
  \ feel the goose bumps rise on your skin. \nWe had made it!\n\nEach step down my\
  \ legs were shaking and I truly wondered if I could do it. An adventure into the\
  \ wild that will mark some of the most pivotal moments of my life."
