Text: "Travelling to India was an overwhelming experience, although we couldn\u2019\
  t foresee how this trip would affect our lives, when we looked for the cheapest\
  \ flight to any unknown destination for us. It was our first time in India and more\
  \ than that, it was our first time in Asia. Arriving in Delhi was exciting; but\
  \ since the first day I could not think about anywhere but the Taj Mahal; so we\u2019\
  ve stayed in a hostel in a tiny messy street in the center of Main Bazaar, really\
  \ close to the Train Station. \nBuying the tickets was a bit of a shocking situation,\
  \ the train station in Delhi is difficult to describe as I\u2019ve never seen anything\
  \ like that; a mass agglomeration of people in the railway, mixed with rubbish and\
  \ luggage; in an incomprehensible passivity. After two long hours of misunderstandings,\
  \ we\u2019ve managed to get the tickets to Agra. The next day we were in the train\
  \ station one hour ahead of time, but it was not enough to avoid the inevitable.\
  \ We could not find our train, and after a couple of minutes we\u2019ve realized\
  \ that the platform number could be wrong, so we needed to go to the ticket office\
  \ to ask for information. The clock was ticking and we\u2019ve started to run with\
  \ the backpacks on our shoulders, trying to cross an avalanche of people. The communication\
  \ with the lady in the ticket office was unbelievable, although we spoke the same\
  \ language, we couldn\u2019t understand each other. It was the most awkward and\
  \ desperate situation I\u2019ve ever been in. Since we had no other option, we\u2019\
  ve followed the lady's instructions and went back to the platform. The names of\
  \ the travellers were printed on a paper, which was glued to the train carriage,\
  \ so when we finally found our names, we didn\u2019t think twice and enter the train\
  \ which was about to leave. The trip to Agra didn\u2019t take four hours as it was\
  \ supposed; instead it took fifteen hours, as we caught the train to Varanasi by\
  \ mistake. It was a totally unexpected experience, too dreadful and thrilling but\
  \ humorous as well. We did not see the Taj Mahal after all, but we\u2019ve discovered\
  \ a breathtaking holy city, with a vibrant energy, that we didn\u2019t feel anywhere\
  \ else. Travelling in India taught us to accept the inevitability, to learn how\
  \ to be peaceful in the middle of chaos and the most important, India taught us\
  \ to enjoy each moment of our lives."
