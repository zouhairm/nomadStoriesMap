Text: "When my world came crashing down I sought solace in travel. \n\nI was in a\
  \ dark place filled with heartache, I needed to breathe air not contaminated by\
  \ the memories and shame of my broken marriage, and to be around people who saw\
  \ me for who I was, not the wife I used to be.\n\nI kissed my little ones goodbye,\
  \ and took off on my motorbike for a 4-day solo adventure to the Indonesian village\
  \ of Ahmed. \n\nThe unfamiliar streets instantly began to soothe me, and the sights\
  \ filled my mind with a barrage of wanderlust. It was just the distraction I needed.\n\
  \nWhen you veer off the beaten track in Bali, away from the cluttered streets of\
  \ Kuta and Seminyak, you find beauty in the most unexpected places.\n\nIt emanated\
  \ from the palm tree covered mountains soaring up through the low lying clouds,\
  \ it surrounded the locals bent over in rice paddies, with only tattered scarecrows\
  \ to keep them company. I saw it in the chickens, chased by scantily clad children\
  \ covered in dirt from a good day\u2019s play. \n\nAs I rode through a small village\
  \ in the north motorbikes and crowds consumed me, with Gamelan music ringing through\
  \ the air. I was amidst a cremation ceremony, with a procession of caskets (or lembus\
  \ in Balinese), and the tall multi-level waddhus lavishly decorated with bamboo\
  \ and paper to celebrate the life of the deceased.\n\nDespite the commotion I was\
  \ perfectly still with my thoughts as I watched this beautiful celebration of life\
  \ pass by.  My feelings were totally unexpected. Tears rolled down my face for people\
  \ I had never met, and I was overwhelmed with a feeling of gratitude. For my life.\
  \ For my children. For the now.\nWhen I arrived in Ahmed I hired snorkelling gear\
  \ and off I went. \n\nInstantly I was in another world. Surrounded by the colourful\
  \ architecture of life. The ocean soothed my soul, I let go of the control I\u2019\
  d held onto in my everyday life, and floated into the ocean\u2019s deep existence.\
  \ It was powerful, and immensely overwhelming.\n\nAgain, gratitude.\n\nI felt the\
  \ freedom of solo travel. It\u2019s an eye-opening experience, breaking down barriers\
  \ between cultures and letting you see the world in a different, more detailed light.\n\
  \nI hadn\u2019t experienced this kind of happiness in a long time. Travel does that\
  \ to you. It makes you feel small, yet has the ability to fill you with a huge amount\
  \ of empowerment and gratitude.\n\nThe fire in my belly was lit. This solo trip\
  \ had sparked a love of myself, a curiosity, and a gratitude that was dwindling\
  \ back home. \n\nThank you Ahmed, you ignited my soul!"
