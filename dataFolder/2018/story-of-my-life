Text: "Not many people have heard this story, and I\u2019m sure the person I\u2019\
  ll be talking about doesn\u2019t even remember that day. Sure thing, he won\u2019\
  t care.\n\nThis happened in SW London, in 2015. It was nearly Spring.\nAt the time,\
  \ I was still buried in the blue-carpeted office with windows sealed with cement.\
  \ The job itself wasn\u2019t that bad, but about 80% of the team was composed of\
  \ spectacularly incompetent people. I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve ever tried\
  \ working with spectacularly incompetent people, but I can tell you that since then\
  \ my tolerance toward idiots has dropped below zero.\n\nYou know when in a workplace\
  \ each and every move you try to make is obstructed by a stupid process that prevents\
  \ you from performing your job to a decent standard? You know when you try hard\
  \ to change things but nothing can be done, so you just end up doing pretty much\
  \ nothing relevant all day long?\n\nMy job at the company consisted of translating\
  \ their website, marketing collateral & co. from English into Italian AND into French\
  \ AND into Spanish.\nThe Boss had created the role especially for me after rejecting\
  \ my application for another position. It was good to get a job tailored to my skills,\
  \ but I didn\u2019t want to be a full-time translator, let alone in a place where\
  \ I was not allowed to wear my Nike trainers. Try to work in all these languages\
  \ on a daily basis wearing black ballet pumps and being surrounded by shouting morons,\
  \ while also hearing Catalan at home all the time, and then you\u2019ll tell me.\n\
  I was going crazy, and I feared I\u2019d end up like a mute penguin.\n\nPlus, since\
  \ the beginning, all my hard work was being fucked up by this remote IT team in\
  \ India that was having fun pasting my Italian content in the French website and\
  \ vice versa, because they had too many spreadsheets open at the same time, for\
  \ God\u2019s sake.\nLife had been going on like this for months when, on that day,\
  \ the Boss blew up.\n\nHe is not a bad guy a priori. He is Aries, and I\u2019ve\
  \ got a long history of creative chemistry with this star sign, but each time it\
  \ finishes in a terrible way. I fall in love with their shameless and loud way of\
  \ being, we do amazing things together, we have fun, and then we suddenly mess everything\
  \ up, we never say sorry and we end up detesting each other. I don\u2019t know why\
  \ it\u2019s that, too much fire I suppose.\n\n\nCONTINUES HERE: https://the-shortlisted.co.uk/story-of-my-life/"
