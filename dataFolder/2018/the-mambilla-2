Text: "Every 20 miles or so there was a checkpoint crudely assembled with whatever\
  \ materials was available.\n\nFrom a distance, Yusuf, the driver would reach for\
  \ his glove compartment and take out a single note from the wad of N50 notes and\
  \ crumple it in his hand before turning down the music.\n\n\"Sannu da aiki,\" the\
  \ driver would say in greeting. \n\nSometimes the officer responded but often they\
  \ didn't. Instead, they would glare at the driver, at me and then move to the back\
  \ of the car peering at my bags through the glass at the trunk.\n\n\"Driver, what\
  \ is inside those bags,\" they said menacingly. \n\"They are for madam.....women\
  \ things,\" Yusuf said looking at me.\n\"That and my books,\" I added. Not wanting\
  \ the idea of lingerie and perfume to linger in their minds.\n\"Yes, yes,\" Yusuf\
  \ added. \"She is a student coming to do some research.\" \n\nAt the same time the\
  \ driver would extend his hand out the window as if to open the door from the outside\
  \ of the car. His hands would meet the officer's hand and the silent exchange of\
  \ currency would immediately create a sunny disposition from the officer.\n\n\"\
  Safe journey,\" they shouted as we drove away.\n\nSometimes, the officer would make\
  \ the driver debark from the car and meet him behind the car or in a corner. When\
  \ this happened the driver often returned in a grumpy mood and I know he had been\
  \ extorted for more money. But, sometimes the officers simply waved him by shouting\
  \ felicitations as we drove past leaving a cloud of dust.\n\nHave you seen the fruit\
  \ sellers that peel their oranges with a razor in one circular motion? Reflecting\
  \ back that is what the trip up the mountain reminds me of. The singular narrow\
  \ road winding up- round and round into the clouds. The mountain on one side and\
  \ a deep ravine on the other side cascading into a bright green mass of vegetation\
  \ consisting of trees, shrubs and rocks. This magnificent landscape continued as\
  \ far as the eye could see ascending and descending elegantly as hills, mountains\
  \ and valleys. This perfect view divided by the streams that flowed down forming\
  \ trench-like incisions that divided the landscape.\n\nTransfixed, I asked the driver\
  \ to stop, and I emerged from the van to take pictures."
