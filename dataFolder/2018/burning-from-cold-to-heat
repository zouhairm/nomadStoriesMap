Text: "Suddenly, I couldn't feel my body anymore. My feet were burning and my whole\
  \ body was trembling. I tried to convince myself that everything was fine, but I\
  \ couldn't think straight. I was scared. My senses seemed to fail. My mind was in\
  \ another place. I had never felt like this before. Cold, wind, freeze. Heavy breathing.\n\
  \nI wasn't alone. I was covered by a mantle of stars under the black winter sky\
  \ and surrounded by the frozen waters of the Kuolimo lake in the innermost of Finland.\
  \ All I could see was darkness and a path of ice in the snow that would lead me\
  \ to one of the warmest places I had ever been to. So I opened the door.\n\nIn a\
  \ matter of seconds, warmth surrounded me and my sensations changed completely.\
  \ Shyly, I sat down in the hot wooden seat. Sweat was falling from my forehead.\
  \ I could smell of trees, hearth and winter. It felt as if my skin would separate\
  \ from my body. To burn from cold to burn from heat. However, it felt so good.\n\
  \nOne of the women that was sitting there spoke to me. She was naked and was staring\
  \ at me as if I had come from another world. The baldness in her head, her pale\
  \ skin and the scars in her body revealed the darkness of her past. However, there\
  \ she was. Sitting in the upper side of that place without fear and showing her\
  \ real self. Leaving the suffering and the pain aside.\n\n\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D\
  , she asked.\n\nI replied, and we engaged in a conversation that lasted for hours.\
  \ The look in her eyes and the warmth of her voice made me feel at home. We talked\
  \ about countries and traditions, feelings and emotions, future and past. Some minutes\
  \ later, she took her towel and headed outside towards the lake. I guess it was\
  \ time for a fresh start. \n\nSomehow, what I had lived a few minutes before seemed\
  \ less scary than I thought. Listening to such inspiring stories and pushing myself\
  \ to the limit made me realize how powerful we humans are but also how much fear\
  \ and distrust we carry with us. Something that I thought was impossible had given\
  \ me one of the best experiences in my life.\n\nFor some reason, destiny had led\
  \ me to this remote place in Savitaipale, one the most homely towns in this Nordic\
  \ country. Far from home. Far from my old life. Far from everything. However, I\
  \ felt so lucky for being in the right place in the right moment. \n\nAnd, that\
  \ is to say\u2026 I didn\u2019t expect a public Finnish sauna to be like that!\n\
  \nRegarding my new friend, I\u2019m not sure if we will ever see each other again,\
  \ but who knows\u2026 Maybe in the next session?"
