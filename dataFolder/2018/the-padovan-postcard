Text: "Jun held the faded postcard at arm\u2019s length before us: the paint was old;\
  \ the tables new; but the building was the same. \n  \nWhile my appearance blended\
  \ well with the locals, my friend Jun (a first-generation Korean-American) stuck\
  \ out a bit in Padua\u2014a relatively small, university town in the north of Italy.\
  \ Though one of the oldest cities in the country, Padua\u2014or Padova in Italian\u2014\
  is less saturated with tourism than its more famous cousins. Hence, when we made\
  \ pointed inquiries about a half-century-old postcard, we were met with a high degree\
  \ of interest.\n\n\u201CWe found it!\u201D Jun delightedly squealed, as two young\
  \ Italian men tried\u2014with practiced and affected pointedness\u2014not to notice.\
  \ What we\u2019d found was one of the more prominent architectural landmarks in\
  \ the town\u2014an 18th Century gem known as Caffe Pedrocchi. \n\nSat under the\
  \ cooling shade, sipping the signature espresso menthe, Jun took it in with quiet\
  \ pride. What with all the numerous times I made her \u2018pose for a photo\u2019\
  \ while any one of my intended local subjects sat unknowingly in the background,\
  \ she now had a project of her own: wholly caught up in the story behind a postcard\
  \ found in a charming, dusty, old bookshop. \n\nOur thoughts were interrupted when\
  \ an impeccably dressed man approached our table. \u201CExcuse me, but I heard you\
  \ have been searching for my caf\xE9.\u201D The current manager, he had brought\
  \ us a photographic history, explaining how the caf\xE9 \u201Chas been through Nazi-occupation,\
  \ Fascist resistance, and has many stories.\u201D \n\nAs we learned the history\
  \ of Caffe Pedrocchi, it stood out that both he and our server Massimo were immeasurably\
  \ more interested in us as people than simply customers.  Perhaps due to Padua\u2019\
  s comparatively low tourism, they were endearingly grateful that someone had taken\
  \ such an interest in their caf\xE9. Instead of being one of the many spectators,\
  \ we felt part of the story, if even a small part. \n\nAlas as the sun set and our\
  \ cups emptied, our time at Caffe Pedrocchi was up. \u201CI can see you again?\u201D\
  \ Massimo implored Jun (quite persuasively due to his proximity to the tempting\
  \ confectionaries display). Though his answer was one of disappointment, Jun and\
  \ I still remember Padua in a different, entirely more personal light. Florence\
  \ evoked feelings of awe and reverence, Venice was mysterious and intriguing, but\
  \ Padua separated itself on a level that only happens when you connect with a city\u2019\
  s people: not only how history has shaped them, but how they have and continue to\
  \ shape their own."
