Text: "Lofoten, foggy islands in the north of Norway which attract thousands of tourists\
  \ and mountain climbers every year for its stunning scenery. Me and my friend happened\
  \ to be two of them. I dreamed about experiencing a touch of it. Sharp rocks forming\
  \ into high mountains, stunning views over hills covered with moss and small path\
  \ leading me through all of it. \n\nIn Norway hikes are divided into three types.\
  \ On a map you find hikes which are marked, partially marked and not marked. As\
  \ it turned out to discover any marks of the first type was not particularly easy.\
  \ And what about the other two? With rain showers a path soon became a swamp so\
  \ we tried to walk on rocks and moss instead. My waterproof shoes became rather\
  \ water full. Finally, water stop falling from the sky and sun showed up instead.\
  \ We had certainly lost the way from Svolv\xE6r to Kabelv\xE5g. After some time\
  \ main road appeared below us. To hit the road was our backup plan as it connects\
  \ all the villages in Lofoten. We decided to build a tent on the hill and do a midnight\
  \ hike around this area.\n\nI woke up with a feeling of something wet which turned\
  \ out to be water slowly dripping into the tent. Storm was bursting outside and\
  \ we packed quickly before all our things got wet. Plan was to reach what looked\
  \ like a petrol station down the hill. I looked on my shoes, which did not even\
  \ dried fully yet and I knew they are not going to get wet again. Then a tricky\
  \ idea occurred to me. How about to walk down barefoot?\n\nLoosing the tent pushed\
  \ me to the edge. Worried about how we are going to spend this night we finally\
  \ left the tent not only barefoot but also with nothing but underwear and raincoat\
  \ covering the bottom part. No time for risking loosing both shoes and tracksuits.\
  \ \n\nAnd then I felt a real touch of Lofoten. Sharp rocks under my feet pinching\
  \ my skin, stunning views on hills covered with moss which scratches like a rug\
  \ and a small slippery and muddy path leading me through all of it. Raindrops trickling\
  \ all around my calves, wind blowing me from side to side. I did not imagine it\
  \ like that but my sensitive skin felt every detail of the path. I counted every\
  \ step.\n\nAfter 573 steps we reached the petrol station and it was closed. Luckily\
  \ there was an open waiting room for lorry drivers. Two benches soon became our\
  \ beds for this night. And before falling asleep my painful feet reminded me of\
  \ a real touch of Lofoten."
