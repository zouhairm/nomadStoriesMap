Text: "The frenzied jockeying reminded me that I wasn\u2019t in Kansas anymore. My\
  \ nagging inner voice paralleled the organized chaos of people funneling themselves\
  \ into the shortest immigration line. Every time thoughts of questions that would\
  \ be asked raced around my head, I arranged them into categories of answers I had\
  \ prepared.\n\n\u201CI am an American. So what if I was born in Iran.\u201D \n\n\
  Holding my passport to my chest like a holy book, I took hesitant steps toward the\
  \ counter. Her eyes glossed over my stamp filled passport, hovering over the first\
  \ page. Not only was I an Iranian, but my last name screamed Muslim. I had prepared\
  \ myself for the worst and was astonished as the immigration officer welcomed me\
  \ to Israel. \n\nMy confusion began to rise. This was a country I was forced to\
  \ curse when I was a child. I felt slightly ashamed as I walked through the airport,\
  \ vividly remembering the morning school rituals of Israeli flag burning and stomping.\
  \ How could they let one of us in without even a bit of questioning? I called it\
  \ luck and found my way to my hotel. \n\nThe dinner I had with the friends I made,\
  \ precisely an hour after I had left my hotel room, filled me with more than just\
  \ food. It fed me spoonfuls of hope. Every friendly exchange chipped away at the\
  \ toxic skepticism that had accumulated over time and I was glad to let it go.\n\
  \nTel Aviv instantly felt like home; where the dated buildings and the narrow streets\
  \ have a cozy feel, filled with charming imperfections that make you glad you decided\
  \ to walk. The nostalgia brought tears to my eyes. I pretended I was walking through\
  \ the streets of what would have been Tehran. The Hebrew I heard sounded close enough,\
  \ people looked familiar enough and for a few moments I was able to feel like I\
  \ belonged. It was as if no one had ever said, \u201CGo back to your own country\u201D\
  . For a few moments, I was able to let go of the enraging reasons for why things\
  \ were the way they were and forget how foreign I felt no matter where I lived.\n\
  \nI floated back to my hotel with an effervescent joy. My trepidation of spending\
  \ the night in jail had turned out to be so serendipitously opposite of reality.\
  \ I immediately called my parents to assure them of my unscathed state and to gloat\
  \ of the hospitality I had received.  \n\nWhat if travel, instead of being another\
  \ passport stamp to show off, was the ideal solution to mend the gaps between broken\
  \ bridges. \n\nReassuring thoughts such as this float around the open sunny space\
  \ that has recently been freed up in my head."
