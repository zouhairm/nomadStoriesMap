Text: "\u201COH splendid, just peachy.  I cross the last item off my \u2018How to\
  \ be the Most Unavoidably Clich\xE9 Backpacking Millenial Shopping List.\u201D In\
  \ hindsight, that should have been my sarcastic drenched thought leaving the bookstore\
  \ loaded with translation books jammed with foreign languages that I was sure to\
  \ master between flights. My actual (na\xEFve) thought went more along the lines\
  \ of \u201CI\u2019m cool as hell.\u201D\n\n[Eons] later, men warily shuffle making\
  \ room for my tired butt to sit and enjoy the show. Why we\u2019re seated here,\
  \ I\u2019m not sure, but looking out to the mass crowd of curious faces, I realize\
  \ it\u2019s the only spot left. Everyone gawks as we sit amongst the band, I become\
  \ instantly aware of my unwashed hair. Thankfully the incense sizzle wafts by and\
  \ mixes in with my locks; I might look out of place but I\u2019ll smell like I belong.\n\
  \nI turn to greet my neighbor. My smile returned by a judging \u201Cuhm\u201D and\
  \ nod. I hear the distinct sound of denim ripping as I slide across the rough bench\
  \ in an attempt to get comfy. I find it just as exhilarating to collect rips in\
  \ my jeans as it is to watch my passport stamped. I settle myself with the fresh\
  \ memory of the sounding rip.\n\nThe first note rings out as a queue to the show\
  \ beginning. First sounding like plump raindrops falling into puddles, the music\
  \ soon gathers momentum as each musician adds notes. Music and dance fill the nicks\
  \ of time between costume changes and scenes.\n\nI later learn this traditional\
  \ musical instrument is called angklung. The distinct \u201Cklung\u201D sound that\
  \ bellows out is definitely suitable to its name. \n\nThe next note I do alone,\
  \ looking to the old eyes for approval. He isn\u2019t a man of many words but I\
  \ got the message. My questioning gaze is returned with another, yet less gruff\
  \ sounding \u201Cuhm\u201D and a nod. I can\u2019t help but notice the small smile\
  \ turned at his lip. I wiggle my toes like him as I keep wailing the bamboo pipes\
  \ instrument.\n\nI lean back and close my eyes. Each \u201Cklung\u201D radiates\
  \ from my fingertips, through my body. The woody swirl of incense floats up my nostrils\
  \ and straight to my head, still masking my unwashed hair. The childlike cluster\
  \ of instruments brings a gurgling laugh from the pit of my belly.\n\nOpening my\
  \ eyes back to the moment, I catch the old man\u2019s head bobbling up and down\
  \ in continuous approval. I don\u2019t speak Bahasa, nor he English. But we understand\
  \ each other. Its the conversation I longed to have, the one no translation book\
  \ would have ever taught me. For this splash of time we both speak music."
