Text: "It\u2019s 3am, New York, I feel sublime. After weeks of camping I\u2019m finally\
  \ clean and wearing the most glamorous piece of clothing in my case. The charcoal\
  \ satin dress offers perfect protest to weeks of hiking gear. There is also a high\
  \ probability it\u2019s the only clean thing left. Julia stands beside me, stunning\
  \ in powder blue. Several hours of sipping cocktails have brought a dream like quality\
  \ to the moment, softening the edges of my vision, making life feel perfect. There\
  \ is only one problem, we\u2019re in Chinatown but desperately craving pizza. \n\
  \nA loud horn breaks my reverie and I turn to face the biggest yellow taxi I\u2019\
  ve ever seen. \u201CAre you alright girls?\u201D, he hollers down from the JCB.\
  \ A thick Irish accent betrays his routes, though the dark scruff of hair and pale\
  \ complexion would have given him away in a second. Julia, free of inhibition as\
  \ always, enquires after the nearest pizzeria. Her casual tone would make you believe\
  \ it was lunch time and you we\u2019re in Little Italy. Before I know it she\u2019\
  s climbing into the cab. She\u2019s 100% insane! My mind quickly jumps to the worst-case\
  \ scenario as both sets of eyes turn towards me. \u201CIt\u2019s up here or in the\
  \ digger\u201D she squeals with delight. Maybe death in the pursuit of pizza isn\u2019\
  t the worst way to go? \n\nTo this day I couldn\u2019t tell you our heroes name,\
  \ details like that seemed of little importance in comparison to our empty stomachs\
  \ and raucous hysteria. He tells us this is his New York, middle of the night, empty\
  \ roads, high above the street. Decked out smart in his hard hat and hi-vis there\
  \ is an air of pride about him. The cab is impeccably clean, a picture of some cute\
  \ kids is stuck to the dash board. His kids? Nieces and Nephews? We never ask. Even\
  \ I begin to relax my suspicions, trusting our guide on the tour of a lifetime.\
  \ \n\nTrue to his word, we pull up at a bustling pizza joint and jump out. A couple\
  \ of slices leave us change out of $5. The price reflects neither quality or quantity.\
  \ Thin and crispy at the crust, gooey with mozzarella cheese in the centre. But\
  \ before I have time to take a second bite dejavu strikes, a horn again breaks the\
  \ silence. Pizza practically hanging out of our mouths we stare wide eyed as the\
  \ JCB parks up. \u201CI told you I\u2019d be back, can\u2019t have you wandering\
  \ the streets\u201D he jokingly scolds in a fatherly tone.  Back up we go, this\
  \ time balancing our precious bounty as we bump along. \n\nWaving a final farewell,\
  \ we stumble into the hotel laughing. Our hero drives off, forever immortalised\
  \ in legend."
