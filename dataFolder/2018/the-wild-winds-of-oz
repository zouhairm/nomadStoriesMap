Text: "The waves came sideways in quick choppy bits splashing over the nose of my\
  \ kayak, blinding me with salty spray. I wrestled with the risk of jumping into\
  \ the water, with whatever lurked in the deep, or grow old at sea. The wind booted\
  \ the small boat forward nose diving, rocking in the dips and valleys of the waves.\
  \ Currents pulled us, threatened to sink us and lurched our boat headstrong as we\
  \ fought to stay on course. Solid and forbidding, land jutted out sharply with rock.\
  \ It was this outcropping I attempted to avoid while turning around, praying for\
  \ shore. In my periphery, I caught the flash of a mate\u2019s boat tipping, losing\
  \ paddles and picnic paraphernalia. The water was a heavy weight champion and we\
  \ were out in open ocean. Our plight to make it over rough skipping waves onto a\
  \ small lump of sand stretched an hour across the afternoon. The night before, while\
  \ clearing fallen trees, we told jokes about the salties and water snakes. We weren\u2019\
  t laughing anymore.\n\nCaught at that particular moment, paddling against the winds,\
  \ I doubted my resilience. This was the second of two life-altering decisions I\
  \ had to make in less than 30 days. The first, after an Australian friend invited\
  \ me on a wild adventure to visit her home country then left me stranded in a dark\
  \ parking lot on a small Hawaiian island. Narrowly avoiding a threat to my safety,\
  \ I opted for a different kind of friend. I traveled solo on a one way ticket to\
  \ a country my finger had never even landed on when I spun the globe. Chasing the\
  \ whip of my intuition, I backpacked up the Eastern coast, landing where I liked\
  \ and moving on when I pleased. I was led to this particular island by a cyclone,\
  \ to offer assistance and help clean up the mess. A cyclone is an inward spiraling\
  \ wind. The word itself, auspicious enough, means the coil of a snake. It is a true\
  \ force of nature often referred to as a meteorological phenomenon. For me, it was\
  \ metaphorical as well.\n\nLike the fickle friendship that blew through my life,\
  \ it seemed only right to find my way to Oz, to offer my help and calm my own inner\
  \ spin. Sitting on the sand, exhausted, delighted and alive, I watched darkness\
  \ turn the ocean to ink. The moon shone brightly, bursting above the hills, providing\
  \ a path of light on the water. It had guided the nose of our kayaks back, pale\
  \ yellow like the gold road that led Dorothy to the wizard."
