Text: "A few years ago my family and I went on holiday to Bali. \nWe spent a few days\
  \ in Denpasar. Wherever we went, we were approached by people selling things, following\
  \ us to our hotel. We then headed up north, to Lovina Beach. We took a cab there.\
  \ Needless to say that we had a few \u2018commercial\u2019 pit-stops where, again,\
  \ we were offered bracelets, gadgets and bananas to feed the monkeys. I later found\
  \ out that in monkey language, it\u2019s considered a sign of weakness. I can\u2019\
  t say I was really thrilled by how the year began.\nChecked into the hotel, we went\
  \ to the beach. We were greeted by a flock of saleswomen. They were so persistent\
  \ that my mother and sister preferred to lounge by the pool and I seeked refuge\
  \ swimming in the sea. By then, I was pretty disappointed and couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ why people were so excited about Bali. The next day we met two friendly hotel\
  \ employees and started chatting with them. We asked them to take us to the cock\
  \ fights. To thank them, we invited them for a drink at one of the bars. A beer\
  \ was the equivalent of a bag of peanuts. They had never been since it was too expensive\
  \ for them. I then asked one of them if he could take me somewhere to see something\
  \ local. Filled his gas tank up, for the price of a cappuccino in NYC, we took off.\
  \ We drove through several local villages, honking every time we went through one,\
  \ which is a form of respect to the locals. We finally reached a village and stopped,\
  \ it was his. He took me to see his house and introduced me to his parents who,\
  \ having a white person in their house for the first time, hurried off to prepare\
  \ something to eat and drink; in spite of saying I was fine, I was handed a plate\
  \ of food. The mother then started chopping a piece of sugar cane, which she rinsed\
  \ under the tap. I was weary and feared I\u2019d get sick, but did not. Then, his\
  \ uncle showed me their fighting cocks, got me to spar them (with no blades) and\
  \ showed me their field of mango trees. That was precisely what I wanted to experience.\
  \ After thanking and saying goodbye to his family, who wouldn\u2019t let me leave\
  \ without a bag of chopped sugar cane, we went to another cock fight, in the middle\
  \ of a forest; no tourists, except for me. I met his friends, had a drink and bet\
  \ on a few fights. That was, without a doubt, the best day of all. Despite slightly\
  \ suffering from the flocks of tourists that arrive in Bali daily, I believe that\
  \ that day I experienced the generosity and kindness that amazed Charlie Chaplin\
  \ back in 1932."
