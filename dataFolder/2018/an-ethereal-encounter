Text: "As the subtly spiced incense welcomes me in, her radiant soul ignites the room\
  \ and I am transported into a transcendental realm. The canary yellow walls and\
  \ humble green window frames conceal the paranormal mysteries that lie within. 1428\
  \ North Rampart Street, New Orleans. Welcome to Priestess Miriam\u2019s Voodoo Spiritual\
  \ Temple.\nBehind the innocent, crimson door, decorative carvings embellish the\
  \ shelves and tribal patterned tapestries clothe the walls. I am lured in by nine\
  \ primitive faces adorning another door, it\u2019s skin etched with history.\n\u201C\
  What brings you to my temple?\u201D\nAn ebony skinned woman stands before me. Her\
  \ voice is assertive yet sincere. Flamboyant, beaded necklaces cascade down her\
  \ vibrant pink and orange tunic. Her headpiece is an understated green. She is beautiful.\n\
  I am not here for a ceremony or to ridicule her misunderstood lifestyle, I am here\
  \ to discover a way of life so dissimilar from my own.\nPriestess Miriam invites\
  \ me into a room much dimmer than the last. It is strewn with paraphernalia: candles,\
  \ masks, instruments and herbal remedies, not quite the spectral temple I envisaged.\
  \ I notice something odd. Amid the disarray of articles, dollar bills are meticulously\
  \ rolled into medicinal bottles, tucked behind the eyes of African masks and neatly\
  \ folded between the pages of books. Money is left as a gift to the spirits.\nI\
  \ run my fore finger down the crumpled spine of a book, it\u2019s title illegible\
  \ from years of wear. I delve further into Priestess Miriam\u2019s world and she\
  \ reaches out to mine. As we share stories, I become entranced by her life. She\
  \ tells me that, 2 years ago she relocated after a devastating fire engulfed her\
  \ temple of 26 years. The damage to the temple was irreparable but her possessions\
  \ escaped, unscathed.\n\u201CMy husband\u2019s spirit protected me and my belongings.\
  \ The fire was not a warning, but an opportunity.\u201D\nPriestess Miriam\u2019\
  s outlook on life truly inspires me. As a thank you to her and in honour of her\
  \ late husband, I choose to leave an offering myself. I explore the room until I\
  \ feel an energy drawing me closer. A small, serrated stone on a crowded shelf entices\
  \ me. From my back pocket I pull out a crumpled dollar bill, fold it as neatly as\
  \ I can and tuck it under the stone. As I turn back to face Priestess Miriam a surge\
  \ of energy erupts within me. The twinkle in her eye lets me know this is no coincidence.\
  \ I just experienced an ethereal encounter."
