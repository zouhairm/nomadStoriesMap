Text: "\u2013 \u201CWould you like to do it?\u201D\n\nTwo weeks in Trujillo. On the\
  \ Peruvian coast, where the desert meets the Pacific Ocean, and Spring persists.\
  \ Capital of La libertad and third most populous city in Peru, Trujillo is, for\
  \ most travelers, a 3 day stop. Strolls along the city\u2019s colonial center, a\
  \ visit to Chan Chan  and, if in a daredevil mood, perhaps a life-threatening bicycle\
  \ ride to Huanchaco. I had done all that and still lingered.\n\n\u2013 \u201CI would,\
  \ but I\u2019m afraid of it. Of the effects it may have, what it might do to me.\u201D\
  \n\nWachuma. A native cactus from the Andes, used in sacred ceremonies by pre-Colombian\
  \ cultures of South America, dating as far as the Chavin civilization (1000-200\
  \ BC). \n\n\u2013 \u201CWhen the Spanish came, they asked what does wachuma stand\
  \ for. The indigenous told them wachuma opens consciousness, opens the gates of\
  \ heaven. Today, most people know wachuma as San Pedro. The saint that holds the\
  \ keys to the gates of heaven\u201D.\n\nMart\xEDn had invited me to a wachuma ceremony\
  \ at the Huaca de la Luna. The Temple of the Moon is Peruvian heritage, perhaps\
  \ the best preserved archeological site of the Moche Culture (100-700 AD). This\
  \ soft brown, adobe structure, has stand facing Cerro Blanco (the white mountain)\
  \ for more 1500 years. \n\n\u2013 \u201CMart\xEDn this is where the Moche made human\
  \ sacrifices\u201D \n\nI had visited Huaca de la Luna before, had read the sign\
  \ explaining human sacrifices were held in this place. A nighttime, wachuma ceremony\
  \ on consecrated ground. And he just nodded, smiling. Mart\xEDn is one of those\
  \ people, that knows people.\n\nSlowly. Totem by totem, Ombayec, the shaman, made\
  \ his altar. On the left side, Dark had only three or four objects, on the right,\
  \ Light had more than a dozen: shells, whelks, even an image of Christ. Christianity\u2019\
  s spread throughout the globe always had the capacity to assimilate or fuse with\
  \ pre-existing belief.  The Conquistadores also gave it a slight push.\n\nOmbayec\
  \ cleaned us, asked what were we looking for, what troubled us and prayed. To Apu,\
  \ to his ancestors, to Christ. With both his hands Ombayec offered me the cup. I\
  \ was truly scared. Wachuma, for some gringos, is a recreational drug. But it isn\u2019\
  t. It\u2019s an opportunity to look upon yourself. My hands trembled, I looked at\
  \ the mountain, asked for protection and drank wachuma.\n\nI walked around the temple,\
  \ gazed at Aiap\xE6c, the feline, sea wave hair, cutthroat god of the Moche, and\
  \ waited for a change of consciousness.\nAs night left us, in Cerro Blanco, a feline\
  \ smiled."
