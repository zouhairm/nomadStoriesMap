Text: "\"Woah, It would appear that we are at an impasse\"!\nI gazed in awe across\
  \ the massive landslide that now blocked our way. My eyes searched up for its beginning\
  \ & down for its end. I saw neither, just clouds of mist & a chasm like gorge disappearing\
  \ below. Boulders the size of cars & vegetation littered what was once recognisable\
  \ as a road.\nThat morning had started with much excitement as today was to be the\
  \ day I finally fulfilled a childhood dream. For today, I was destined to follow\
  \ in the footsteps of the Incas towards their fabled mountain Citadel, Machu Picchu.\
  \ This was to be by far my highlight of Peru & maybe even the whole of South America.\n\
  After much laborious searching & negotiating in true backpacker tradition, I settled\
  \ on a tour of biking & hiking.\nEarly the following morning we whizzed through\
  \ the narrow, cobbled streets of Cusco in a crowded battered old minivan, heading\
  \ towards our first stop atop a mountain. I loved this part of travelling, because\
  \ as ever, my tour was to be filled with wonderfully varied people with different\
  \ personalities from all kinds of backgrounds, ages & countries from all over the\
  \ world. These encounters are truely just as much fun as the tour itself. \nSoon\
  \ after we arrived, we were given the obligatory debriefing before mounting the\
  \ tubular framed steads we would hurl ourselves down the mountain upon.\nI sped\
  \ down the mountain in the cool morning air with new friends and reckless abandon\
  \ until most suddenly, we skidded to a halt!\nAhead lay an impasse, both literal\
  \ & soon to be metaphorical.\nAs I studied the landslide closer, it dawned upon\
  \ me that this may well be an abrupt end to my dream of ever reaching Machu Picchu.\
  \ For alongside finances, time, is surely a traveller's greatest nemesis. Perhaps\
  \ an hour went by until the fever pitch of phone calls & chaotic shouting came to\
  \ a head. Incredibly & perhaps rather skeptically our guide suggested we climb over\
  \ the huge, recently fallen & still moving landslide!\nNow, I'm all for high adventure,\
  \ adrenaline & even the odd calculated risk, but were our 'responsible' guides seriously\
  \ suggesting that we literally risk our lives? The dire consequences raced through\
  \ my mind, if any of us tripped or the landslide started moving again or more landslide\
  \ came from above, then we would surely plummet into the void. The cold, stark reality\
  \ before us was, failure could actually mean death!\nThen again, we could make it,\
  \ continue our adventure & have one hell of a story to tell!"
