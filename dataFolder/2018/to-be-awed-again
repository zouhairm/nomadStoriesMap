Text: "Having spent 40 minutes in freezing waters of 8\xB0Celsius, my toes were numb,\
  \ my fingers were numb, and I was holding hot cocoa against my cheeks and nose so\
  \ that I can feel my face again. I am not a big fan of the cold, yet I happily jumped\
  \ into the arctic waters at the southern tip of Cape Town at the promise of swimming\
  \ with wild seals. I felt like a Disney princess! I had expected to see some wild\
  \ animals, but never in my life did I dream to go swimming with some!\n\nThe month-long\
  \ journey has been filled with surprises. When I started my Southern African camping\
  \ adventure a month ago, I was prepared to rough it out in tents, showering with\
  \ cold water, and chewing on game meat next to the crackling fire at night. Some\
  \ of that did happen: I did sleep in a tent but it was far from rough; I did have\
  \ to shower with cold water, but that was just that once; I did chew on game meat\
  \ next to a crackling fire because the camping site that I stayed at has a nice\
  \ fire going and game meat is a healthier choice for pre-bedtime snack.\n\nWhat\
  \ I did not expect was to be so thoroughly immersed and awed by nature: I was so\
  \ overwhelmed by the stars against the ink-black sky at Zimbabwe that I almost cried\
  \ and I still do not know why; I did not expect to stroll in Victoria Falls's splash-back;\
  \ I did not expect to drink from the flooded delta of Botswana (do not try this);\
  \ I did not expect to be entranced by a pride of lions finishing their meal in Etosha\
  \ National Park; I never knew that sand-boarding is more sustainable than snow-boarding\
  \ (but also a lot more work because there are no ski-lifts); I did not expect to\
  \ hug a baobab tree; I did not expect a monkey to rob me of a bag of potato chips;\
  \ I did not expect to fall so in love with Cape Town that I almost missed my flight\u2026\
  \n\nIn the age of information free-flow, I thought that nothing can surprise me\
  \ anymore. All that I want to know is a quick click away. But in that month of travel,\
  \ I have experienced what pictures and videos cannot communicate: a sense of wonder.\
  \ I went on the trip with little expectations other than the clich\xE9s (seeing\
  \ wild powerful animals and maybe learning a little history and culture). The last\
  \ thing I expected was for my sense of awe to be reignited\u2026 and to feel like\
  \ a Disney princess!"
