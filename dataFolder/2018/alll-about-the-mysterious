Text: "In advance, collecting rucksacks with food and water, we set off. We climbed\
  \ about 4 hours to see incredible nature. Koreans say their nature is the most beautiful\
  \ on the planet. You believe it, seeing hilly slopes, thin bamboo in one forest\
  \ with spruce and maple. The nature reminds me films about ancient Asia, it seems\
  \ that wars in traditional costumes will come out soon from trees , and in the distant\
  \ future the outlines of ancient palaces will appear. In Korea it gets dark early,\
  \ so at 3 o'clock we started to go back down. At this moment, all the fun began.\
  \ Going down, we heard a strange ringing, as if someone was beating the gong. We\
  \ decided to see what kind of sound it was. Following it, we went to a small path.\
  \ The sound was from the little gong standing in the middle of the path. A little\
  \ old man was beating a gong, dressed like a Korean monk. Nearby there was a small\
  \ ancient temple. It wasn\u2019t not surprising, because in the Korean\u2019s mountains\
  \ you can often meet Buddhist temples. Then this old man got up and began talking\
  \ with us. I have been studying Korean for 2 years already, but it was difficult\
  \ for me to understand exactly what he was saying. I precisely understood the phrase:\
  \ \"I will tell you about your future.\" In fact, I am a person who believes in\
  \ everything supernatural, so I accepted his proposal. Then he took out some dry\
  \ leaves and threw them at my feet. He told me about success in my life, the diseases\
  \ that are present in my family and about the journey that will change my whole\
  \ life. For me, these things seemed nothing more than a set of certain phrases that\
  \ you can tell everyone. We said goodbye to him and went on. At 6 o'clock we were\
  \ already at home. The next day I told my Korean professor about this story. Then\
  \ I heard the last thing I expected. He said the temple I saw was built in the 50s\
  \ of the last century. The monks really lived there, but then decided to go to another\
  \ temple. He said no one had been seen there for the last 20 years. The words shocked\
  \ me. I thought the teacher was joking, but his face did not express a single mockery.\
  \ The most interesting thing is that all the predictions of this monk have come\
  \ true, except journey that will change my life. Perhaps it was a mystical man,\
  \ perhaps it was just a monk from another temple, accidentally came into the area.\
  \ One thing I know for sure, unusual and incomprehensible things exist, and such\
  \ moments make travel and, in general, life more interesting and fun."
