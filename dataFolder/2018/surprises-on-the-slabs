Text: "Locate the Salton Sea in your California atlas, or in Google Maps like a normal\
  \ person, and you\u2019ll also find the town of Niland, on the sea\u2019s eastern\
  \ shore. It\u2019s the last on-the-grid town before the curious city known as \u201C\
  The Slabs\u201D. Branded as \u201CThe Last Lawless Place in America,\u201D it promises\
  \ a unique experience. Who and what one might find in this desert settlement is\
  \ anyone\u2019s guess. \n\nWe rolled in as the sunset graced the calm salt waters.\
  \ In the dying light, we saw RVs of various size and condition scattered across\
  \ the landscape. In search of anyone willing to offer an introduction, we made for\
  \ the Internet Caf\xE9, which was little more than a 10\u2019 by 20\u2019 open-air\
  \ structure riddled with old couches and covered by a crude tin roof. Adorned with\
  \ a 52\u201D flat screen, it was a sight to forget. \n\nAs we pulled in, two men\
  \ approached. One was middle aged with long hair. His companion was in his 20s.\
  \ We invited the men into our RV for libations and the older man began detailing\
  \ his time as an animal trainer for Barnum & Bailey\u2019s Circus. Skeptical but\
  \ amused, we listened as he described his companion: an \u201Cexquisitely trained\u201D\
  \ feline. \u201CYou must meet him,\u201D the man coaxed, \u201Cthere\u2019s no cat\
  \ like him in the world.\u201D Why not, we thought. But, lo and behold, when we\
  \ went to the man\u2019s truck we found a window open and the famous cat missing!\
  \ \n\nWe launched into a search for a tiny-cat-in-a-huge-desert and all daylight\
  \ faded. As the search dragged on I couldn\u2019t escape the suspicion we were being\
  \ duped. This man could\u2019ve been honest, but he may also have sinister intentions.\
  \ My trust worn thin, we abandoned the search with little remorse. \n\nHaving gained\
  \ no knowledge at the Caf\xE9 we navigated dark roads for an hour looking for camp.\
  \ Finally, we passed a small bonfire, around which six young folks laughed and sang.\
  \ Using the RV\u2019s megaphone, my brother startled them when he asked, \u201C\
  Y\u2019all mind if we park here?\u201D\n\nNow timid of the folks I might find in\
  \ this peculiar place, I was last to leave the RV. But once intros were made it\
  \ was clear we had found a comfortable space to relax, laugh, and learn from one\
  \ another. We spent two nights with our new friends sharing food, booze, stories,\
  \ and music. No currency exchanged hands. No fights took place over the distribution\
  \ of goods. \n\nThe desert brought us together. Anxiety led to education. This experience\
  \ forever opened my eyes to the rewards of acceptance and the need to postpone judgment\
  \ until a place, and its people, are given a chance."
