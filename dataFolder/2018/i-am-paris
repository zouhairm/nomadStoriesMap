Text: "\u2018Stay inside, be safe,\u2019 my family had urged, but I couldn\u2019t.\
  \ I was compelled to join those who were not afraid. I stepped outside and closed\
  \ the door behind me. In the boulevard, a constant stream of people with a shared\
  \ destination: the Place de la R\xE9publique. It was the night of the attack on\
  \ Charlie Hebdo, and I was in Paris.\n\nHow did I end up here?\n\nI was between\
  \ uni and a job, with eight weeks of freedom before entering the corporate world.\
  \ What better to do than travel? I had spent Christmas with my parents in Germany,\
  \ then booked a French language course \u2013 two fabulous weeks in Paris. I\u2019\
  d been in la Ville Lumi\xE8re only a few days, making butter croissants my main\
  \ meal, walking the cold but charming rues for kilometres, debating whether I\u2019\
  d live in artsy rive gauche or sophisticated rive droite. My French, rusty from\
  \ years of perfecting my English, was making a slow comeback.\n\nDelivered via text\
  \ message, the first sign of danger: \u2018Are you ok? Mum\u2019. It was midday\
  \ and I had just finished class. I frowned. Parents\u2026 I was in Paris, for goodness\
  \ sake, not Gaza. I stuffed my phone in my pocket. It was a cold day and I decided\
  \ to take the Metro rather than walk. At the station the second sign of danger manifested.\
  \ Speakers blared unceasing announcements and I listened intently. I understood\
  \ snippets about taking the quickest route home.\n\nDid my mother know something\
  \ I didn\u2019t? I looked around the station. People hurried, steps echoed. It was\
  \ quieter than usual: no melodic chit-chat, no laughter. Suddenly I was scared.\
  \ Back at the hotel I learned what horrors had unfolded. All afternoon I was glued\
  \ to my phone: checking Twitter, reassuring my parents. \u2018I\u2019m fine, really.\
  \ A little scared, yes, but fine. Don\u2019t worry.\u2019 Outside, sirens continued\
  \ to howl through empty streets.\n\nBut the Place de la R\xE9publique was filled\
  \ with people. Some held candles, the flickering light illuminating sombre expressions.\
  \ Others clutched hand-written posters or raised pens in the air. We had gathered\
  \ to mourn together, to show solidarity, to hold hands in the face of terror. I\
  \ moved through the crowd, edging closer to the statue of Marianne clad in French\
  \ Tricolour. Someone started humming the Marseillaise and I swayed and wept with\
  \ those around me.\n\nThat night, Paris stood united: Je Suis Charlie from thousands\
  \ of individuals became Nous Sommes Charlie. I was there \u2013 part of the whole,\
  \ part of history. It was a feeling I will never forget: I was Paris, and Paris\
  \ was one."
