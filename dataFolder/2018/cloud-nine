Text: 'I could see the majestic landscape before me. Landscape, awashed with deep
  black colour. A moon in top right corner, was beaming up the whole scenic view,
  with dimly lit stars splashed across the night sky.


  Mountain slope, descended down from the edge of my balcony, seemed to be merging
  with other hills at a distance. However, the green canopy dissolving into the darkness
  made it difficult to asses the whole topography. Its end could only be defined by
  the small hamlet, spreading in a small area, all lit up, between other two hills.
  Few tufts of cloud over it, added another element of beauty to it.


  Silence creeping up in the atmosphere, gave way to the clicking sound of my lighter.
  I lit my cigratte, and blew a puff of smoke in air, raising my head back to the
  view. No sooner did I adjust my glance, than I witnessed clouds floating into my
  direction. And the next moment, I was in  clouds!


  I could see nothing, but the pure whiteness all around. I had lost the sight of
  nearby elements- the door of my dormitory plucked into the hill, the trees, those
  hills, and that village. The only sight now beaming was the edge of my lit cigratte.
  I took another drag, and let the smoke out, that soothingly flew through the clouds,
  and finally mergerd into them.


  This cojnured up, terrifying beauty didn''t fail to surprise me. Silence was now
  tranquility. It was a bliss, and why not, I was  literally on cloud nine!'
