Text: "During my last camping trip with my Granny before she requires round-the-clock\
  \ care, walking on a groomed forest trail, my sister and I are eager to reach the\
  \ park.  Regularly we stop and wait for our Granny to catch up. Each time she reaches\
  \ us she says, \u201CI may be slow, but I keep on going.\u201D We smile and walk\
  \ with her until our natural gaits and young attention spans pull us ahead again.\
  \ She doesn\u2019t hold this against us; she is just happy to be out for a walk.\
  \ \n\nI signed up for the Inca Trail with complete faith in my physical abilities,\
  \ yet I find myself taking another breathless step while chewing coca leaves as\
  \ if the tongue-numbing plant were all I needed to live. I pay little attention\
  \ to a wild llama who materializes in the tall grass on the side of the path, absorbing\
  \ the encounter only as an unabashed excuse for a break. While I was aware the altitude\
  \ would be a problem, I did not anticipate how little physical strength matters\
  \ when I can\u2019t catch a breath. I have spent this last stretch not looking at\
  \ the valley but only at the next patch of dirt where my foot is about to land\n\
  \nMy patient husband is faring much better. Every time he unknowingly walks beyond\
  \ an arbitrary limit I have devised for him, I feel he is leaving me behind. Only\
  \ to have him turn around to give me the encouraging smile I need. \n\nTurning my\
  \ attention inward, I recall my Granny. A rare disease hindered her movements in\
  \ life, and when barely a senior, she was rendered immobile with her mind playing\
  \ tricks on her. Because of this, when I travel she is at the forefront of my heart.\
  \ \n\nWhen I do reach the summit, it is cold, and clouds are rolling in.  Blinking\
  \ back tears, I embrace the views of the valley and celebrate with my group before\
  \ descending to camp. The next two days bring lower altitudes, varied terrain, Inca\
  \ ruins, and an unexpected shift of my own inner landscape. Every time we start\
  \ and stop, my legs scream, but I keep on going. My focus changes from conquering\
  \ a challenge to reveling in the beauty of one. At one Inca site I feel as light\
  \ as the clouds surrounding us. While walking through the jungle I enjoy both solitude\
  \ and company.  Standing on Inca terraces I hold my husband\u2019s hand in amazed\
  \ silence as we absorb views of the vast Sacred Valley. Surrounded by more llamas,\
  \ I pause in delight at their antics. The rest of the trek I stop staring at my\
  \ feet; I am just happy to be out for a walk."
