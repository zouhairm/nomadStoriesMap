Text: "\u201CDo you want to try?\u201D The shop owner greeted me with accented English.\n\
  \n\u201CJust looking thanks.\u201D\n\nInterrupted, I abruptly re-racked the coat\
  \ I had been admiring and continued on navigating the waking market as the vendors\
  \ set up their stalls, preparing for the night to come. \n\nFlecks of familiarity\
  \ still remained in the journey to the MRT station, jumping out at me through the\
  \ haze of years of absence. The subway cab quietly murmured with fellow commuters\
  \ making their way home to continue their own story lines. My family greeted me\
  \ with the same encompassing warmth and questions about my day at work. As usual,\
  \ plans for the upcoming New Year\u2019s celebrations were being formed over steaming\
  \ bowls of rice. I was unable to help with preparations this year; I had been rostered\
  \ to work New Year\u2019s Day. Before I had simply been too young to not be a hindrance\
  \ despite nagging desperately to be involved.\n\nAs usual, the 24 hour news channel\
  \ droned in the background relaying familiar discussions surrounding the upcoming\
  \ elections and one party\u2019s aims at becoming independent from China. It remains\
  \ a divisive topic that will be carefully shuffled around at New Year\u2019s dinner\
  \ in order to avoid another shouting match. I was too young then to understand the\
  \ campaign slogans or read the banners on the way home from primary school; this\
  \ time my understanding is lacking only in background knowledge and local context.\
  \ \n\nMy mind wandered back to the market, analysing how I had presented myself,\
  \ trying to figure out what prompted the shopkeeper\u2019s stumbled greeting. I\
  \ remembered in my last visit the shopkeepers greeted my Aunty familiarly and presented\
  \ sweets that might bring joy to my small round face.  They commented on my pigtails,\
  \ eliciting a proud response in my infantile Chinese that I had tied them this morning\
  \ all by myself.\n\nDespite choosing to feign ignorance and trying to convince myself\
  \ that the use of simple phrases and slower speaking pace was the norm, my new reality\
  \ was becoming increasingly apparent.\n\nThis small pit stop on the way to the place\
  \ that I had always believed to be my home up-ended my farce and brought me face\
  \ first to the reality I had tried so hard to ignore. The shopkeeper had simply\
  \ been trying to make her first sale of the night; instead, with the little English\
  \ she knew, her words pierced my identity and confronted my heritage. No longer\
  \ am I viewed as a local, as Taiwanese; instead, outwardly, I\u2019m now a foreigner.\n\
