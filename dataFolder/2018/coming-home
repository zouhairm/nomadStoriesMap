Text: "It was 1300. I was looking through the mess hall in Bagram Airfield, Afghanistan\
  \ scanning all the faces to find Parween. I found her sitting at a small table,\
  \ her black hair combed neatly back from her forehead. Parween, who appeared in\
  \ her late forties, had beautiful distinctive features highlighted by wrinkles of\
  \ happiness. I asked her what it was like growing up in Afghanistan. \"We grew up\
  \ during the Soviet occupation, our family was used to electricity. But every time\
  \ someone would repair it, the electrical lines would just be cut again. In high\
  \ school I decided to play tennis at a schools in Kabul. They hired a Russian tennis\
  \ instructor who drove us insane. I cried a few times, but I got to be on the first\
  \ female tennis team of Afghanistan.\" Pausing, she said, \"one thing that makes\
  \ me indignant is that people don't realize how beautiful the civilization of this\
  \ country is. In 2006 I was driving through Afghanistan, to the north, to see the\
  \ village where my parents were born. A friend of mine told me to go to this beautifully\
  \ carved rock. I can't remember the name of it now, but when I was there I knew\
  \ it was magical. It was older than anything in the West practically biblical, like\
  \ the tower of Babel. All of the waters converged. There was even a legend surrounding\
  \ the spot of how an old war hero built it to impress an emperor so that he could\
  \ marry his beautiful daughter.  I loved that day traveling through my country,\
  \ seeing the sights. I felt like I had come home.\u201D Then she asked me: \u201C\
  What do you think of your homeland?\u201D \u201CWhen I think of my birth place I\
  \ think of rolling hills full of tinted blue rainbow grass, of early morning sunrises\
  \ on limestone cliffs, \"I said.  She nodded knowingly. \"For me it is this dusty\
  \ place, these high peaks covered in snow. I can look out at them, and looking I\
  \ feel at home.\" \"Is it sad for you to be here?\" I asked. \"Sometimes it is,\u201D\
  \ she replied. \u201CI don't know if I recognize this place. I don't think it is\
  \ the place of my childhood. Sometimes, though, I get so sad. I feel as if I could\
  \ cry for a long time over my country. There are times when speech is as insignificant\
  \ as one blade of grass in an endless field. I thought of all the sufferings of\
  \ this country, the unspeakable losses, and the eternal longing of return to one\u2019\
  s homeland. I had to get back to work. She stood and embraced me like an old friend.\
  \ I left without looking back, wondering if I would ever see Parween again, the\
  \ door to the hall closed behind me."
