Text: "Sitting along the Coast of Death at the end of the world, the sun slowly melts\
  \ off the world's edge, each shard of disappearing light prompting reflection. My\
  \ legs dangle off the cliff face, overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, my back to the\
  \ town of Finisterre. The lighthouse has started shining across the water, battling\
  \ the full moon for luminosity. As the night closes in on my final day as a pilgrim\
  \ I ask myself, at the end of the world what really matters?\n\nFinisterre is located\
  \ on the Costa da Morte (Coast of Death), in Galicia a province of Northern Spain.\
  \ When the world was thought to be flat, Finisterre was believed to be the end of\
  \ the known world - here you could fall off the world\u2019s edge. Now it\u2019\
  s the final destination for many pilgrims walking the Camino de Santiago.\n\nI came\
  \ to Spain alone to walk the Camino. The ancient pilgrimage has been walked for\
  \ thousands of years. People from various countries, cultures, and backgrounds walk\
  \ over 800 kilometres westward across Spain. \n\nI expected 1 month of walking 9\
  \ hours a day to be a journey of deep introspection, but the Camino is not an isolated\
  \ trek. You cross paths with pilgrims sharing a fragment of their journey, glimpsing\
  \ momentarily into their lives.\n\nRising earlier than the sun the sky was still\
  \ bright with stars. An ethereal pre-morning fog surrounded us. It was impossible\
  \ to see a step in front of you but we trusted the rhythm of our feet. The only\
  \ sounds were the distant clangour of cowbells, pebbles rolling under our boots,\
  \ and our breath regulating against the brisk air.\n\n\u201CMalo? Rodilla eh?\u201D\
  \ he murmured, slowing his pace. With a smile I shook my head and motioned for us\
  \ to continue, reassuring him I was fine. My knee was radiating a heat through my\
  \ body that was impossible to ignore, my skin sweltering with pain.  \n\nOverlooking\
  \ my faux bravery he continued in broken English, \u201Cthe Camino gives what you\
  \ need and takes what you don\u2019t. It speaks to you by creating injury.\u201D\
  \ \n\nWith simple words we became intertwined in each other\u2019s story. We walked\
  \ together for a day, offering insight through honest conversation. \n\nYou collect\
  \ pieces of people along the way, connecting by sharing simple moments. \u201CBy\
  \ sharing stories, we form instant connections\u201D, words from a fellow pilgrim\
  \ still resonate. \n\nAt the end of the world, I\u2019d fallen back in love with\
  \ life - with humanity. At the end of the world all that matters are people and\
  \ our connection to each other."
