Text: "My friend from Istanbul has invited me to a Turkish wedding. I was interested,\
  \ and in a week I left my home town Odessa behind for Istanbul.\n\nThe wedding took\
  \ place in a lovely small restaurant, where there were many guests. Everything was\
  \ so different to what I used to see at home. In our traditions the table groans\
  \ with food and drinks. Here I saw the guests sitting around the tables served with\
  \ all kinds of soft drinks, but no food. Everyone was waiting for bride and groom\
  \ to come. Since my friend promised me a Turkish wedding, I expected to see the\
  \ newly-weds in national clothes. Finally, they appeared. The man was in a black\
  \ suit, his bride was wearing a magnificent white dress\u2026 Turkish music spread\
  \ through the hall. Suddenly, the guests began to rise and move towards standing\
  \ bride and groom forming a queue. Each of the guests was coming close to the groom\
  \ and sticking something to his clothes. I went closer and saw that those were cash\
  \ banknotes. The closer a relative was, more value was a gift so as my friend has\
  \ explained to me. That\u2019s the way! \n\nAfter that two young men brought in\
  \ a wedding cake on a huge serving tray. It was a three tiered cake decorated with\
  \ roses and covered with a lacelike tracery. Incredibly beautiful. At the top of\
  \ the cake there were the chocolate groom and bride. I was thrilled with admiration,\
  \ looking forward to getting a piece of that gorgeous cake. The newly-weds took\
  \ both the silver knife and turned to the cake. At this time, the camera snapped\
  \ several times. How surprised I was, when after that the already familiar to us\
  \ young men picked up a serving tray with a cake and carried it away somewhere.\
  \ With amazement I followed the cake with my eyes and licked my lips in anticipation.\
  \ At this point I heard my friend's whisper: Cheer up! This cake was a waxwork.\
  \ It was made of plastic, only for the purpose of wedding photography. I gasped\
  \ and became speechless\u2026 Well, for goodness\u2019 sake!"
