Text: "We had earned this trip! My husband and I work together and built a house together.\
  \ We survived and didn't kill each other for copious amounts of insurance money.\
  \ We did, however, desperately need a holiday.\n\nThe choice of The Baha was a nonevasive\
  \ thought that flowed like ocean  riptides channeling us to the direction of endless\
  \ sunshine. \n\nWe began by exploring San Jose Del Cabo, which is like the calmer\
  \ older sister to Cabo. She is tamer, quieter and more serene. San Jose has a relaxed\
  \ pace and warm people. \n\nOur trip was quickly made by strangers who became fast\
  \ friends. Locals in the same complex generously lent us their snorkeling gear,\
  \ their Escalade to go to the grocery store, and best of all their secondary car.\
  \ \n\nOff we went down the coast with \"The Police\" blaring as background music.\
  \ We passed an expansive desert coastline as we meandered to Tudos Santos. \n\n\
  Tudos Santos is a sleepy hippie town where dreadlocks prevail and organic aromas\
  \ waft by in the air. Surfers and artistic types occupy the town many who are content\
  \ to linger but for us it was time to go. \n\nNext was the quaint town of Las Barilles.\
  \ The town is easily walkable with a great array of eclectic restaurants. Valet\
  \ parking is available right on the beach, where we parched mesmerized by the kite\
  \ boarders, both locals and foreigners dancing in a spin of colours as high as six\
  \ feet in the air. Upon \nleaving our tires dug us deeper into the sand. An angry\
  \ sigh escaped my mouth as I heard The Police song \"Sending out an SOS\". We were\
  \ then miraculously rescued by generous Mexicans who won at tug of war, us against\
  \ the sand. \n\nEl Chorro hot springs was next. For only 20 pesos we were able to\
  \ take in the lush mountainous surroundings, all the while sitting on a bed of sand\
  \ in the perfect warmth of the healing mineral water. \n\nEnroute home we took a\
  \ shortcut that lead us to eight armed Mexicans guarding a prison. They spoke no\
  \ English, and I nervously managed to muster one of the only Spanish words I knew\
  \ other than cerveza, and said \"aeropuerto?\". That, along with my dumbfounded\
  \ expression, worked and they pointed us in the right direction. That was also the\
  \ 100 millionth time my husband said \"I'm never listening to your directions again\"\
  . \n\nThe Baha is engrained in my physique as a giving place graced by affable locals.\
  \ The journey was not perfectly on track but they helped us change course. For this\
  \ I will always be grateful and also now for google maps. Yes it has saved our marriage."
