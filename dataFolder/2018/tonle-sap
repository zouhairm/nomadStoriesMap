Text: "The kid almost fell off the side of the boat. \u201CThat prop would have chewed\
  \ you up, kid.\u201D The foreign language flew over his head and he smiled while\
  \ the sun hit his face. \n\nThe kid knew the water. His house, his school, and the\
  \ white man\u2019s church all float on the water; it moves and breathes and protects.\
  \ His knees feel funny when he steps on the extra-extra-terrestrial soil. On the\
  \ rare trips to town, he used to cry when the soil touched his bare soles, so his\
  \ mother would lift him and rock him like the waves. Now he brings a half-empty\
  \ jug of water along when he leaves his home. \n\nThe American knew about his own\
  \ home and about the land, but he didn\u2019t know about the water. Was that why\
  \ he came here? The tour guide couldn\u2019t tell. \n\n\u201CTonl\xE9 Sap Lake is\
  \ the largest lake in Southeast Asia and home to over 1.2 million people. They\u2019\
  re mostly fisherman and rarely leave the lake.\u201D\n\nThe tour guide kept an eye\
  \ on the kid as he spoke. His gaze said that he was the kid\u2019s mentor first\
  \ and guardian second. \n\n\u201CThe fisherman barter with the traders who bring\
  \ supplies from Siem Reap. They fish early in the morning and finish by noon, which\
  \ is why the lake looks so empty. Should we go see the crocodiles?\u201D\n\nOut\
  \ of the inlet and into open water, the boat rose up and settled flat onto the calm\
  \ surface. The re-purposed 1950\u2019s Cadillac engine roared and no one spoke for\
  \ the five-minute journey to the crocodile pit.\n\nWe docked and stepped up to see\
  \ down. A massive holding area, swarming with crocs, lay just below our feet. A\
  \ man arrived with a wooden platform meant for the pit; the crocs had requested\
  \ a place to sunbathe. Everyone, including the kid, helped lift the unwieldy wood.\
  \  Then, someone needed to climb down into the pit to lower it without a crash,\
  \ so our tour guide volunteered. The kid, shook, hovered nearby and then caught\
  \ the gaze of his mentor below.\n\nThe full-grown crocodiles were five years old,\
  \ no older than the kid. They were no more familiar with the water, no less. The\
  \ kid\u2019s heart skipped when his mind flashed nightmarish images of sharp crocodile\
  \ teeth. With only a glance, his mentor reminded him that man holds something the\
  \ beasts don\u2019t\u2026 Then, the kid\u2019s pupils gradually dilated, and like\
  \ a wave, poise arrived in his heart and calmed the hairs on his neck. He stepped\
  \ into the pit, armed only with a stick, and protected the back of the man who taught\
  \ his heart to defeat fear."
