Text: "Since I was in high school, I learned a lot about the travels of the British\
  \ writer Edith Durham, who visited and wrote about the traditions and culture of\
  \ the Eagles. She described the natural beauties of Alps and especially the hidden\
  \ treasures of the village Theth, which she thought it was the most beautiful village\
  \ ever seen. Trying to follow her steps, under the warmth of the sun, I walked through\
  \ the wood, smelling the fresh scent of savage flowers, listening to Shala`s river\
  \ beats, trying to discover the hidden waterfall, and the blue eye natural beauties,\
  \ the canon stories inside a tower build five centuries before used as the place\
  \ of reconciliation of conflicts. \n\nAt the moment I reached the Lock-in Tower,\
  \ I felt like the words from the stories I had read were whispering from the two\
  \ small windows of the tower. When I approached the garden, the guide smiled happily.\
  \ He was not pretty much robust as Highlanders usually are, but was keen, smiley\
  \ and always in a hurry to start re-telling the stories about the strange tower.\n\
  \n\u201CTheth is a small village with a picturesque relief, which hides so many\
  \ natural and historical treasures underneath the characteristic green,\" says Sokol\
  \ dressed in a traditional suit with the typical Highlander hat, called by the local\
  \ qeleshe, while he was opening the door of the Lock-in Tower in the center of the\
  \ village. He is the inheritor not only of the tower, also of the blood feud stories.\
  \ As you climb the small stairs inside the tower to go on the second floor, you\
  \ will find walls of stones, scratched by time and the Albanian flag hanged on.\
  \ You will walk on the traditional small carpet with red and black ornaments until\
  \ you see in front of the window an old cradle. Sokol approaches the cradle, turns\
  \ it down and explains its story \u201CThe elder of reconciliation put the sex male\
  \ child from the culprit family with the cradle down and waited for the decision\
  \ of the victim`s family. At the moment of the pardon, the cradle was turned because\
  \ the child was risked getting stuck ever after\u201D. \n\nAt this moment, I felt\
  \ a blood pressure inside my veins, trying to follow the shadows of the victims,\
  \ the crying of a child in a cradle, the old men who negotiated both life and death.\
  \ My backpack had become heavier, full of stones, whispers from canon, stories which\
  \ waited to be finally written and known outside the isolated village."
