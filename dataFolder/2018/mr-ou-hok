Text: "Landing in Siem Reap airport I was about to embark on my first solo journey\
  \ as a traveler.  I could feel nerves from what the week would bring and excitement\
  \ to explore a destination I had dreamed of visiting. I was pulled out of my thoughts\
  \ upon the arrival of my tuk tuk driver who I had hired for the week to transport\
  \ me from site to site. \n\nOu Hok was his name. He had a soft smile, and a gentle\
  \ face that wore his experience and age.  I climbed up onto the squeaky red pleather\
  \ seat of his tuk tuk.  It was sturdy, clean and well-taken care of; his name, Mr.\
  \ Ou Hok, painted carefully and proudly on its side.  \n\nIn between long drives\
  \ along dry dusty roadsides spotted with green canopied trees, crumbling temples\
  \ and children waving wildly as they chased after us, I helped him with reading\
  \ English and he told me about his life and family who lived in Phnom Penh.  He\
  \ spoke of his time in the army during the Khmer Rouge and staying in the woods\
  \ hunting for food to eat, his plan to save money to upgrade his tuk tuk and send\
  \ his daughters to University. We even visited his carpenter friend who made his\
  \ tuk tuk by hand. \n\nHe served as a comfort to me while I was there on my own.\
  \ I looked forward to our daily drives together and his company when he occasionally\
  \ joined me in whatever activity I was doing that day. \n\nI was humbled by how\
  \ hard he worked, long days away from his family revolving around the schedules\
  \ of complete strangers; doing what he had to do to provide for them. He left a\
  \ mark on my heart and I am grateful for the lessons he unknowingly imparted on\
  \ me. Worlds apart, the lives we led were unfamiliar to each other, yet so similar\
  \ in that we all feel the same emotions, have the same basic needs and core human\
  \ desires.\n\nA decade later, having traveled to many different places around the\
  \ globe since, my mind often drifts back to Mr. Ou Hok and his red tuk-tuk. Is he\
  \ healthy? Happy? Who is he driving? Have his daughters gone to University? Is he\
  \ still working in Siem Reap? Did he ever get that new tuk-tuk?"
