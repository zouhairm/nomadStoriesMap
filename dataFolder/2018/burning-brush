Text: "I was in the foliage, shoeless, limping. Through the doorframes of the huts\
  \ I could see the villagers peering down at me. The shacks were one-room things\
  \ of wood, resting on four vertical planks, presumably to protect from flooding.\
  \ Beside me was a flock of amber-colored chickens, trotting in a line and clucking.\
  \ The air was humid and quiet.\n\nWhen I broke into the clearing, I saw a house\
  \ standing alone. Inside were three men staring at me, each holding a hand of cards.\
  \ Between them was a glass bottle filled with murky liquid. Two of the men were\
  \ shirtless; all were old. I hobbled toward them, raising an imaginary cup to my\
  \ mouth: Water.\n\nThe men pointed behind me to a water drum, neon-blue and plastic.\
  \ A kid materialized beside me and extended a metal bowl. The men nodded as I dipped\
  \ the bowl into the basin, bringing back the foggy water. I lifted it to the sun,\
  \ and my lips, as the boy watched me drink. The liquid was warm.\n\nI had crashed.\
  \ I was riding my motorbike across a 300km stretch of Ho Chi Minh Road when I\u2019\
  d lost control and ended up splayed on the pavement. There was a punishing gash\
  \ on my abdomen, and my shoulder felt dislocated. And now I was climbing into the\
  \ hut and sitting with the men, as the villagers descended upon the scene.\n\nAn\
  \ eerie silence followed. Then the man beside me, wearing a denim shirt, extended\
  \ a soft hand. His face was weary, traced with lines; his eyes were a startling\
  \ blue. I waited, then took his hand in my palms, bending, placing it to my forehead.\
  \ And then I cried.\n\nWhen I arrive in a country I always fear that, as an American,\
  \ people will turn away from me. There are certainly reasons, especially in Vietnam.\
  \ There\u2019s the war we waged, ravaging their population and countryside. There\u2019\
  s our disinterest in their culture, often reduced to stereotypes. There\u2019s our\
  \ gentle hubris that makes us think we can bike across their land and not be felled\
  \ by our stifling inexperience. Oftentimes, though, these details fall away in favor\
  \ of something more universal. I am consistently astounded by people\u2019s ability\
  \ to express compassion in defiance of the borders that separate us. It\u2019s something\
  \ worth aspiring to.\n\nAnd so I cried. When I was done, the man retrieved a branch\
  \ of tiny green leaves. He lit it on fire and pointed to my abdomen. I presented\
  \ it. He lowered himself and pressed the burning brush into me. It seemed as though\
  \ the entire village had now gathered. And so they watched as I screamed, just as\
  \ much in pain as in delight."
