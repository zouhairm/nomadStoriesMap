Text: "I positioned myself on the deck of the boat and stretched my legs out so I\
  \ could feel the sun beating down on my body. As the vessel pulled away from the\
  \ dock of Sorrento, I closed my eyes for a moment and felt the warmth of the summer\
  \ breeze on my skin. I opened my eyes a few minutes later to the tune of \u201C\
  That\u2019s Amore\u201D by Dean Martin playing in the background. This could have\
  \ easily been a scene out of a movie. I was surrounded by 360 degrees of sheer beauty\
  \ and couldn\u2019t tell where the blue sky ended, and the sea began. The first\
  \ stop was near a waterfall where I jumped into the crystal blue sea. The water\
  \ felt amazing and for a minute, I began to feel neglected, isolated and restricted\
  \ from the rest of the world. A sense of nostalgia gushed through my body as it\
  \ felt as if I had been here forever. The sea, perfectly calm, was like a peaceful\
  \ lake, and its soft murmurs were scarcely audible. I was experiencing a sense of\
  \ calmness I had never in my life felt before and I was in a moment of sheer bliss.\
  \  After boarding the boat again, we headed off to the Isle of Capri. As we approached\
  \ the island, my first view was of the wonderfully coloured houses overlooking the\
  \ harbour filled with small fishing boats gave me the first hint of how beautiful\
  \ this island was going to be.\n\nI enjoyed a spaghetti marinara for lunch, washed\
  \ down with a few glasses of Aperol Spritz. I was amazed at the unsurpassed views\
  \ of the Faraglioni rock formations before me and I lost track of time as I completely\
  \ engrossed in the moment. When I asked for the bill, the waiter had informed that\
  \ it had already been paid for. That was the last thing I expected.  \u201CIf I\
  \ didn\u2019t pay for it, who did?\u201D I thought.\n\nHis name was Giorgio and\
  \ he was dining at a table nearby. I hadn\u2019t event noticed him until that moment.\
  \ I got up and joined him for a coffee and thanked him profusely for his generosity.\
  \ Again, this could have easily been a scene out of movie. We made small talk and\
  \ chatted about our respective lives. This was the first time anything like this\
  \ had happened to me and I didn\u2019t think chivalry still existed. Back home in\
  \ Sydney, men hardly spoke to me let alone paid for my lunch bills. I was flattered\
  \ by the gesture and attracted to his charming personality and his unrelenting pursuit\
  \ to win me over. Our time together was short because I had to go back to the marina\
  \ for the continuation of the boat tour. He insisted on taking my number and I knew\
  \ this wouldn\u2019t be my last visit to Capri."
