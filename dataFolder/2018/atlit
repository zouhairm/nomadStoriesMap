Text: "His camp is in Atlit, 15 minutes from here. I watch Shlomi collect 20 shekels\
  \ here and there from people by talking melodiously in Hebrew. They are generous\
  \ people but I can tell it\u2019s witty what he\u2019s saying.\nWe follow a rural\
  \ road for some time, then go down a filthy hill side and walk UNDER A BRIDGE. \u201C\
  Is this where your camp is?\u201D I ask casually. I watch out for animals and he\
  \ laughs at me for it. A whiff of dislike reaches me in the midst of this excursion:\
  \ In nature, in this raw field of play the situation \u201CWeronika with Shlomi,\
  \ the homeless guy\u201D, is deemed to be a disgusting one. I see it now. Even if\
  \ I had something to say my words would be drowned by bulging muscles of arms, legs,\
  \ stomach. But there\u2019s more: we find a deserted, windy beach. I can see the\
  \ ruins of a castle in the distance, the Chateau P\xE8lerin, built in 1218, now\
  \ the area is a military base, he tells me. And just ahead of it is a light blue\
  \ baldachin covering a khaki green tent and a velvety brown couch. We have arrived.\n\
  \nWhat is rape? \nIndeed, a pair of hazel eyes say yes when you are close enough\
  \ and the small mouth doesn\u2019t decline the pressure of your lips. But the mouth\
  \ doesn\u2019t really help, it is impartial. Maybe it\u2019s tired from the day\
  \ and wants to collectively rest with the other parts of Weronikas\u2019 body. But\
  \ laying down and being alone seems to be a misleading interpersonal signal. And\
  \ what can the body do? This mere synergy of parts that constitute her shell is\
  \ a helpless underling of secondary sexual organs, now moist. It is aware of the\
  \ substantial lack of chemistry, of how unpleasant the touch of rough hands is.\
  \ The mind is shock frozenly trapped in a fixed causality. It must be. I followed\
  \ to Atlit. (Yes, you followed to Atlit.) I went under the bridge. (Yes, you walked\
  \ under the bridge, watched out for animals. I have to laugh because the most dangerous\
  \ one is in front of you.) And I said I'm not scared. \n\nIn the morning there are\
  \ fishermen sitting by our tent. Fat fishermen peacefully fishing in the deserted,\
  \ brutal sea. It\u2019s Sukkot. I go for a swim while Shlomi is asleep on the brown\
  \ couch. One of the fishermen offer me a cigarette when I get out. I smile at him\
  \ and take it in my dripping hands, then sit down on my towel to watch their luck\
  \ and dry my worn out bikini in the late morning sun. I dwell on the smell of saltiness,\
  \ thin cigarette smoke making its path through the air within my reach. I have all\
  \ my belongings gathered around me on my towel: This is a holiday."
