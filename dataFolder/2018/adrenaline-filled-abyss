Text: "When it comes to roller coasters, I have a very simple rule of thumb: if it\
  \ has loops, I won\u2019t be going on it. However, in March 2014, there was an exception.\n\
  \nMy sister and I had never been to a theme park together before. We had both been\
  \ to Disney World before but on separate occasions \u2013  she\u2019d been to the\
  \ park in California; I\u2019d been to the one in Orlando. But in March 2014, we\
  \ found ourselves with our mother in Disneyland Paris. My sister commented that\
  \ when she was in California, she hadn\u2019t been on Space Mountain and she seemed\
  \ to regret this. I hadn\u2019t been on Space Mountain either, having point blank\
  \ refused in Orlando six years prior  and not thought much of it since. \n\nAs the\
  \ day wore on, my sister kept bringing up Space Mountain and I\u2019m not sure if\
  \ it was her powers of persuasion or my need to please people, but as we reached\
  \ the last part of the park, I relented. Our mother immediately opted out, but me\
  \ and my sister headed for the famous Space Mountain together.\n\nAs it was late\
  \ enough in the evening, there wasn\u2019t a queue for Space Mountain, which I hadn\u2019\
  t anticipated. There was very little time for second guessing our decision. My sister\
  \ rushed through the queue area and I had to walk briskly to catch up with her,\
  \ nervously eyeing up the trivia about  Space Mountain displayed in the queue.\n\
  \nBut I persevered, because I had made a promise. I followed my sister as she ran\
  \ ahead in what I assumed was excitement. Before I could process it, I was  sitting\
  \ in the car on the tracks, and a man was telling me to make sure my backpack was\
  \ properly secured so it wouldn\u2019t fall out. \n\nNow, I\u2019ve been to a few\
  \ theme parks in my time. And one of the things you pick up on is that  the safety\
  \ bar you\u2019re given on a roller coaster is a good indicator of how intense the\
  \ roller coaster is. A bar across you lap means you\u2019re not in for anything\
  \ too crazy. Restraints over your shoulders meant you\u2019re in for something a\
  \ little more extreme. So as the safety bar went over my head and was secured, I\
  \ felt a sense of dread along with complete fear. \nWith the roller coaster\u2019\
  s departure quite imminent, I turned to look at my sister. And I noticed \u2013\
  \ her expression mirrored my own. Her eyes widened. And in that moment, we both\
  \ realised \u2013 neither of us had wanted to go on Space Mountain to begin with.\
  \ We only went on because we thought the other one had wanted to go on.\n\nAnd with\
  \ that sudden realisation, we were both thrown into an adrenaline filled abyss."
