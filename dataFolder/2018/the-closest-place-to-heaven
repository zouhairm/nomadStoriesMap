Text: "Stopping our car for mountain goats and yak crossings. Riding horses through\
  \ the vast grassland where the blue of the sky merges with the green of the grassland,\
  \ mosaicked by millions of tiny yellow and pink wildflowers to form a beautiful\
  \ painting. \n\n\u201CShangri-La, the closest place to heaven\u201D is the slogan\
  \ of this hidden place tucked away in the Northwestern boundary of the Yunnan Province\
  \ of China.\nLured here by their slogan, it was not exactly what I would have expected\
  \ from heaven, but it was certainly otherworldly. \n\nAt an elevation of over 3000\
  \ meters, life is unquestionably very different from anywhere else I\u2019ve been.\
  \ Locals of over 20 ethnic groups live in harmony and enjoy a slow pace of life\
  \ with all their livestock roaming free. \n\n\u201CHow do the families tell which\
  \ animals belong to them?\u201D I asked curiously to the head of the family who\
  \ was holding tightly onto the reins of the young horse I was on to avoid having\
  \ me thrown overboard.\n\n\u201CThere are markings on them,\u201D he answered in\
  \ poor Mandarin mixed with thick local dialect.\n\nI stared intensively at the yaks\
  \ around me on the immense grassland, each one of them looked identical to the ones\
  \ next to them and no markings were visible to me. I can\u2019t help but felt a\
  \ sense of magic from this place: the magic of everyone being able to identify their\
  \ own animals.\n\nBack towards the family house, every member of the family was\
  \ working together to build a stone wall by hand while one person was trying to\
  \ fill the gaps with a pot of concrete-like substances. \n\nAs they showed me the\
  \ way to a newly built washroom with no running water, I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ thought to myself how this place is completely different from what we take as\
  \ norms in western countries: animals are not microchipped, tagged, or collared,\
  \ but are allowed to roam free without obvious distinctive markings; families work\
  \ together to build infrastructures by hand with primitive tools instead of hiring\
  \ someone with heavy machinery; and clean running water we have always taken for\
  \ granted is non-existent.\n\n\u201CClosest place to heaven, eh?\u201D I mumbled\
  \ to myself followed by a chuckle. I supposed the communal, peaceful slow-paced\
  \ life do resemble the characteristics of heaven."
