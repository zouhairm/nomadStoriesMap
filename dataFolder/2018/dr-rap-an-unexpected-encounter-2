Text: "Night crept in as my taxi pulled up to the edge of Fez\u2019s medina \u2013\
  \ the biggest urban car-free zone in the world.\n\nI paid the driver and a boy appeared\
  \ from around the corner, offering to lead me to my hostel. Turning into the medina,\
  \ we walked a few blocks through the up and down alleys before the boy pointed to\
  \ my hostel\u2019s generic sign above a mahogany door with carvings similar to those\
  \ first crafted in 13th-century Fez. Some young men about my age stood in front,\
  \ speaking passionately in Arabic \u2013 about what, I did not know.\n\nAfter knocking,\
  \ I handed the boy twenty dirhams. One of the men noticed the 2pac patch sewn into\
  \ my torn bag and asked if I liked rap music. I answered affirmatively and before\
  \ entering, told him my name in exchange for his, Abdul.\n\nAs I explored the labyrinthine\
  \ medina the next morning wearing a newly purchased leather backpack, a voice called\
  \ my name. Abdul waved from a nearby corner, accompanied by another young man. The\
  \ accompanying man introduced himself as Jamal and proposed that we take a walk.\n\
  \nHeading uphill yet breaking no sweat in the early-July heat, Jamal began to rap\
  \ and Abdul to beatbox; maybe Jamal\u2019s only chance to practice that day.\n\n\
  I had yet to learn that Jamal\u2019s father did not approve of rap. A widower, his\
  \ father worked for little pay in a medina shop. Without Jamal\u2019s help, he might\
  \ not manage.\n\nLiving in a monarchy where financial support is scarce narrows\
  \ your focus. Amid struggle, lingering conservative ideology makes rap music easy\
  \ to see as anti-authoritarian and impure. Change is happening, but today Jamal\
  \ raps with discretion.\n\nContinuing our walk, I listened to Jamal\u2019s fluid\
  \ Arabic rhymes. After a few songs we spoke.\n\n\u201CI study medicine at the university\
  \ but it\u2019s just not as interesting as rap,\u201D Jamal said, \u201Cwhen I rap\
  \ I express my life here in Morocco \u2013 the struggle, the joy, the hope; at the\
  \ university I don\u2019t express anything.\u201D\n\nSoon, we got to a small caf\xE9\
  . Upon sitting at a blue-and-white tiled table, an older man handed us green smoothies\
  \ in clear mugs \u2013 a thick mixture of avocado, milk, and sugar called asir avocat.\n\
  \nAs I sipped, Jamal reminisced upon the wholeness felt when breaking fast with\
  \ the drink during Ramadan. When the caf\xE9\u2019s sole speaker started to play\
  \ a popular rap song from the US, a grin came over Abdul\u2019s face; Jamal began\
  \ to rap with the recording.\n\nYears later, I glance at my now-faded leather backpack\
  \ and wonder if Jamal is the doctor who\u2019d rather be the rapper."
