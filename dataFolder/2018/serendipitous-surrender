Text: "Twigs crunch. Leaves crackle. Alice did it too, I think as I dodge the foliage.\
  \ Wonderland happened once she braved the rabbit-hole. Huff, huff. It\u2019s Gangtok,\
  \ not Antartica. I\u2019d surely run into honeymooners.\n\nTwo hours later I accept\
  \ I\u2019m stupid and lost. Thirsty, tired, feeling like Toad, not Alice. The Wind\
  \ in these Willows - or Oaks and Elms - wrecks my hair.\n\nI berate my three inept\
  \ choices today, splurging on a fur blanket I don\u2019t need, hiking with a heavy\
  \ camera and taking the trek less travelled. GPS goes berserk before my phone crashes.\n\
  \nDid I start with the sun behind me? Fourth-grade lessons about directions and\
  \ shadows fail me.\n\nDusk swathes all like a pink Instagram filter. I stumble and\
  \ fumble, harried and hurried.\n\nSuddenly, a clearing.\n\nA glorious sunset. Golden\
  \ waterfalls flowing Rapunzel-like into river Teesta. Ooh\u2019ing and aah\u2019\
  ing at the beribboned Himalayas I snap away. Glad for my camera.\n\nI pause.\n\n\
  Breathe.\n\nHush.\n\nThe sublime moment is far greater than me. I\u2019m ensconced\
  \ in a warm womb. One with all. Like I\u2019m meant to be here.\n\nI take a decision\
  \ that throws me over the edge: No more half-baked logic or guesses. I\u2019d follow\
  \ my gut.\n\nI chase the fading sun. Course along sloshing streams. Collect cones.\
  \ Swat at flies, step over stones, smell the air, smile at life. Patient. Present.\n\
  \nBeauty abounds; here an orchid, there a sunflower.\n\nA wounded bird awaits a\
  \ caress and my white bandage.\n\nMountain goats! Tailing them I sniff my way to\
  \ delicious smoke billowing from a small hut.\n\nAn excited gurgle. \u201CDa-da!\u201D\
  \ An infant throws mud at me. Dada is tall with a bamboo hat and a pretty wife.\n\
  \n\u201CRoad?\u201D I ask, \u201CLost.\u201D\n\nBlank stares.\n\nI use my only Lepcha\
  \ word - Khamree. They grin back shy hellos and invite me in. I protest but the\
  \ man motions that he would walk me home. I could kiss their feet except they would\
  \ be mortified.\n\nThe Sikkim tea - with its salt and butter, more like soup - revives\
  \ me. Then come Momos. There aren\u2019t many left for my hosts but they insist\
  \ so eagerly that I accept, ditching my recent vegetarianism. I tell myself I\u2019\
  m eating a loving gift and not pork.\n\nThey walk me to my hotel. How does one repay\
  \ kindness?\n\nJino, the baby, shivers. \n\nThe blanket! I fetch it. The parents\
  \ refuse. How do I express that this fell into my lap for Jino? That Travel is its\
  \ own Muse? Is there a sign language for Serendipity?\n\nHumility, joy and compassion\
  \ roll down my cheeks as I hug the baby.\n\nHands extend, hands accept and hands\
  \ clasp in friendship."
