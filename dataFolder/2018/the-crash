Text: "\u201CEst\xE1s borracho?\u201D Are you drunk? I open my eyes to find Victor\u2019\
  s face a few inches away, squeezed between the passenger-seat headrest and frame\
  \ of the pickup truck.\n\u201CNo, se\xF1or,\u201D I reply. I\u2019m sitting in the\
  \ jump seat behind Victor, and every jostle racks my body with pain. I wince and\
  \ clutch my left knee as the truck hits yet another pothole. Andean mountains stream\
  \ by, but I don\u2019t seem to notice. Cotopaxi is out there, somewhere.\n\u201C\
  No? Te gusta alcohol?\u201D\n\u201CYeah. Si.\u201D\n\u201CSi si si!\u201D he turns\
  \ around and slaps his leg. \u201CCervezas? Pisco! Pisco sour, eh? Tu sabe?\u201D\
  \ he looks back again, showing a smile of mismatched metal teeth that shine like\
  \ his tarnished police badge. Before I can answer, he cuts me off: \u201CMarijuana?\
  \ Puff-puff,\u201D he says, quieter this time while holding a hand up to pursed\
  \ lips, thumb and stout finger pinched together. There\u2019s dirt under his finger\
  \ nails, or maybe grease. It\u2019s the same color as the stubble on his weathered\
  \ face.\nI\u2019m dizzy. With the adrenaline wearing off, every pain receptor fires\
  \ at will. How had I not seen it? My mind flashes back to the moment on the asphalt.\
  \ Wind from passing cars and semis pushes me around. Horns honk. I try to rise to\
  \ my feet but I collapse into a shimmering sea of gasoline vapors. My whole body\
  \ shakes. Get up. You have to get out of here. Off the highway. A car screeches\
  \ its tires as it swerves around my motorcycle, lying on its side 10 meters away,\
  \ its rear wheel still spinning.\n\u201CCoca?\u201D Victor\u2019s voice pulls me\
  \ back to the truck. The other police officer, the one behind the wheel, chuckles\
  \ to himself without taking his eyes off the road. \u201CTu sabe? Sniff-sniff, eh?\u201D\
  \ Victor says, tapping the side of his nose. More laughter from both. I try to smile.\
  \ The truck hums along.\nBlood begins to seep through the bandage on my knee. There\u2019\
  s blood on my hands, blood on my arms, blood on my face. My left leather boot has\
  \ a hole in its toe and is missing half its laces. My left leg, the one that was\
  \ trapped under the bike when the edge trap brought me down, is torn to shreds,\
  \ as is the left side of my jacket. And my pack\u2014with my money and passport\
  \ and everything I need to ride the length of South America\u2014where is that?\
  \ In the bed of the pickup, I hope, with the motorcycle. I don\u2019t want to look.\n\
  \u201CMujeres?\u201D the driver says into the rear-view mirror.\n\u201CMujeres!\u201D\
  \ Victor erupts in laughter. When he finally gains control, he asks, \u201CTe gusta\
  \ mujeres? Fucky-fucky, eh?\u201D with the appropriate hand gesture\u2014at this,\
  \ I have to laugh too."
