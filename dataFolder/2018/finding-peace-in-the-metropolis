Text: "What struck me first was the air, it had a stillness and yet liveliness/vitality\
  \ to it \u2013 and that space of contradiction which should feel uncomfortable,\
  \ felt very familiar. Our tour group was congregating in front of a shrine, and\
  \ surrounding us were crowds of people prosaically milling about combined with the\
  \ steady stream of voices speaking aloud their thoughts in front of the deity then\
  \ ringing a bell, There are few moments I can count when I have felt this way outside\
  \ a church setting - when you feel that stillness and calm wash over you because\
  \ at your core you feel your soul at peace. \nIt\u2019s different in that I was\
  \ not in a church - we were outside, not surrounded by four walls and a roof, and\
  \ we were only a few steps from the bustling shopping streets of the nearby Osaka\
  \ neighborhoods. There was no minister to preach to us about the scripture lessons\
  \ for today. No choir, no liturgical ritual, no set time frame which we needed to\
  \ complete our worship. We (were all just floating, existing in the steady stream\
  \ of the masses and open atmosphere. here and now.\nBefore the Osaka Tenman-gu shrine,\
  \ our tour guide described Shinto, a traditional folk religion of Japan. At its\
  \ essence, Shinto is the Japanese devotion to invisible spiritual beings and powers\
  \ called kami, shrines, and other rituals. Shinto, our tour guide said, coexists\
  \ with Buddhism and Confucianism. Shinto is not a means to explain the world but\
  \ one, which rituals can allow us to speak with kami. Kami is a sacred element or\
  \ mystical element found in everything. It can be elements of the landscape or forces\
  \ of nature; it makes an object itself rather than anything else. Kami means that\
  \ which is hidden. \nIt was then I knew why I felt so at peace in this familiar\
  \ yet uncomfortable space of contradiction. In my Catholic religion I often times\
  \ felt at odds with my Vietnamese heritage when I pay my respects to my ancestors.\
  \ Roman Catholics only venerate saints as intercessors with god or pray for departed\
  \ souls in purgatory. But in the Vietnamese tradition we carry out ancestral ceremonies\
  \ to express the love and respect for those who came before and helped make/shape\
  \ what we are today. That space of contradiction of my religion and my ancestry\
  \ it felt encompassed here, that both could exist, and Shinto held space for both\
  \ to exist. I felt complete and at peace with the duality of contradiction."
