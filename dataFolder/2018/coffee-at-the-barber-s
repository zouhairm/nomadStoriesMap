Text: "Snippets of my hair are falling to the floor like snowflakes. They land scattered\
  \ across a fragile-looking tile floor. The air is filled with cardamom coffee that\
  \ Abdullah offered us before we\u2019d managed to cross the threshold. Five minutes\
  \ ago, I was  the street, and now I\u2019m having my hair cut by a new friend in\
  \ downtown Ramallah.\n\nEarlier that morning, I was in Jerusalem, where the timeless\
  \ limestone walls envelop you in history. The mountain breeze is caught by the souq\
  \ and mingles there with the overpowering smells of incense, rubbish, flowers and\
  \ roast meat. Cries from stalls, children laughing and the muttering of soldiers\
  \ rise into a clamour that is both a welcome and a warning. But that is Jerusalem.\
  \ A kindly old Jerusalemite warned me, with an sagely nod, \u2018Don\u2019t go to\
  \ Ramallah. City people are not friendly\u2026 there is no soil, no room for trees\
  \ to grow.\u2019\n\nHe was right about the soil. Parched, baking, strewn with rubbish,\
  \ it\u2019s hard to see how anything grows here. And yet trees grow. And Abdullah\
  \ is cutting my hair \u2013 he grew up here too, and must have found some water\
  \ for his roots. In place of the Old City's narrow stone labyrinths, a spider's\
  \ web of roundabouts assaults the senses with car horns and dust. Instead of the\
  \ gleaming al-Aqsa Mosque, the Jamaal Abd an-Naaser stands like a lighthouse, a\
  \ neon green beacon for pilgrims in the hot, dusty streets below. Jerusalemites,\
  \ used to tourists and pilgrims, look at you with familiarity, but here \u2013 only\
  \ 20 miles away \u2013\_you catch people looking at you with eyes a little aglow,\
  \ possibly out of curiosity for strangers, or possibly as a silent plea for help.\n\
  \nThis is where Abdullah, a man my own age, lives and works. Despite a severe language\
  \ barrier in both directions we somehow manage to chat about girls, bars and TV.\
  \ He is trying to get into Birzeit University. \u2018I see people from other countries\
  \ visiting here,\u2019 he says, \u2018and I see my friends leaving to travel, and\
  \ I am stuck here.\u2019 University could be his ticket out. \n\nI say goodbye but\
  \ later on that evening, I have a stab at Palestinian \u2018generosity culture\u2019\
  \ by popping back round to the barber\u2019s with a tray of baklawa from the local:\
  \ he welcomes me in and we sit drinking coffee for a while. We go for a drink in\
  \ the town. It's a difficult place, an arid one, but the people are unfailingly\
  \ hospitable and kind. No room to grow? I don\u2019t think so."
