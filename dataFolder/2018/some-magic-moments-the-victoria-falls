Text: "The Victoria Falls\nThis trip to Zimbabwe wasn't on my travel route at all.\
  \ It all started with a picture, and I fall in love with the idea to be on top of\
  \ a waterfall, sitting at the edge in a natural pool and watch the water falling\
  \ down. I didn't heard a lot of this country and aswell, I mostly prefer so visit\
  \ countries who have a beautiful coast, beaches and a lovely spot to surf. But this\
  \ time there was something magic that surrounded me. First I was sure that I can\u2019\
  t pay all those flights and activities, visas and accommodation, but something wanted\
  \ me to be here and then some magic happend..\n\nSo where it all began.\nFew weeks\
  \ ago my mum visited her uncle in Portugal, they haven\u2019t seen each other for\
  \ 40 years.. {because there is/was an big family issue/ fight, but that is an other\
  \ story}\nSo he is the brother of my grandpa, and I never saw/ meet him before.\n\
  \nAfter my mom told him that she has a daughter [me] he was curious about what I\u2019\
  m doing and so my mom told him that I\u2019m traveling at the moment, writing my\
  \ blog..\n\nAt this time I was about to plan my Africa trip, I was in Namibia, in\
  \ a Hostel in Swakopmund, thinking about going to the Victoria Falls or just stick\
  \ to my original plan.\nI just decided to not go there, it was too expensive.\n\n\
  So I told the news my mom, telling her it\u2019s not worth to spend so much money.\n\
  My granduncle heard that and just wanted to talk to me through the phone.\n\nI\u2019\
  ve heard from my mom that he is really well travelled and adventurous.\nSo he talked\
  \ to me, telling me that I have to see this new world wonder and that he will give\
  \ me a \u201Clittle\u201D bonus so I can afford the trip.\nIt wasn\u2019t a \u201C\
  little\u201D bonus it was quit big!\nAnd the reason why I can say \u201Cyes\u201D\
  \ to his bonus, he told me, is because his brother [my grandpa] helped him always\
  \ out with his university stuff, he always supported him, so he wants to give something\
  \ back.\nAs he was talking to me and trying to convince me to just take his bonus,\
  \ some tears run down my cheek.\nIt touched my heart that he was just adopting me\
  \ as a grandchild without even knowing me, without thinking twice he gave me so\
  \ much trust, love and power.\nI was happy and felt this new feeling, to have a\
  \ grandpa who cares.\n\nAnd I can\u2019t wait to show him the pictures I took and\
  \ also I can\u2019t wait to visit him and listen to his travel stories {he climbed\
  \ the Kilimanjaro 18x times..}\nSometimes life gives you those magic moments you\
  \ can\u2019t explain.\nThis was one of them. And I\u2019m more than happy that all\
  \ this happened."
