  Yes, you win! This is amazing!! The trek to the top of the Anjaneya hill is totally\
  \ worth it.\u201D, answered Tej beamingly.\nThis happiness on her partner\u2019\
  s face was all she wanted. Both of them then sat on a rock for hours together, overlooking\
  \ the panoramic view of the UNSECO World Heritage site, Hampi in the state of Karnataka,\
  \ India.\nAs they continued their unending conversations, \u201CImagine this would\
  \ have been a busy city of the great Vijaynagar Empire. Sadly, only the ruins remain\
  \ now to tell us their stories.\u201D, contemplated Tej.\nFor, she was only happy\
  \ to have finally found a life partner, who kept a similar view on life. As they\
  \ continued enjoying the Sun signing off, Naina murmured, \u201CTej, I want to tell\
  \ you something\u201D. Tej sensed her apprehension and frowned back at her \u201C\
  what\u2019s bothering you in this historically-beautiful environment?\u201D\nShe\
  \ smiled and her cheeks resembled the colour of the Sun that was slowly drowning\
  \ behind the hills. \u201CI\u2026 I had made a promise to myself here\u201D. \u201C\
  A promise to remain happy in life and let go off the worries\u201D\n\u201CAnd what\
  \ made you to think of this\u201D, he asked her after kissing on her big, flat forehead.\
  \   \n\u201CThe last time I was here, I was with my Ex.\u201D, she stopped after\
  \ saying this trying to gauge his reaction. \u201CGo on\u201D, he assured. \u201C\
  the plan was that the Ex would join me here but his office was more important for\
  \ him, so he didn\u2019t come. I called him around 3-4 times to share the view of\
  \ this amazing place. He didn\u2019t pickup. After sometime, I got a message from\
  \ him that read:\u201CI am done with you, it\u2019s OVER!\u201D\n\u201CThe world\
  \ went blank for me at that moment, and I wept on this same rock, alone, thinking\
  \ was I really this bad to be hated so much after SEVEN years of relationship?\u201D\
  \ Naina added as she shed another drop of tear.\nShe added \u201Cyou know what made\
  \ me to calm down then?\u201D\n\u201CWhat was that?\u201D Tej questioned.\n\u201C\
  I saw an old lady, would be 60+ years old, walking with the help of a stick and\
  \ she had a helper. I observed her, enjoying the cool breeze that blew her grey\
  \ hair. She faced the sun with an open heart. I could feel the connection; she was\
  \ sharing with the nature!\u201D, added Naina.\n\u201CThat\u2019s great, but even\
  \ my Mom likes to visit places, she also has problems while walking. What about\
  \ her that inspired you so much? \u201D, asked Tej.\n\u201CShe was blind& she opened\
  \ my eyes!\u201D Naina cut him short."
