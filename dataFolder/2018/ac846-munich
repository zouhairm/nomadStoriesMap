Text: "It took me two minutes to become aware of the fact that I couldn\u2019t hear\
  \ the music since his cat had eaten my headphones, just because I was too busy wishing\
  \ that bus took me a little further. I had already been traveling for seven hours\
  \ when we stopped. Toronto was apparently a vast city full of those skyscrapers\
  \ that we Europeans are forced to watch in every movie that comes from the other\
  \ side of the ocean. And that was exactly where I was.\nAmong the things I learned\
  \ that day, I can attest that putting signs outside the subway stations would be\
  \ a very practical activity to avoid stress for travelers who are not familiar with\
  \ huge cities. I also got to learn that a rocket is not only something that flies\
  \ to outerspace but something you can get in order to reach the airport, which was\
  \ exactly what I needed so I could get home and nurse my broken heart. \nI\u2019\
  m always in a bad mood when it comes to return flights, but can you imagine feeling\
  \ the post-vacation depression as it hits you and you\u2019ve run out of tissues\
  \ because you\u2019ve been crying too much? Well, it could get worse. I suddenly\
  \ heard the cries of an old Mexican woman asking for help all around the queue.\
  \ Don\u2019t judge me, I was just too tired the first five times I ignored her petition.\
  \ There was none but me that could communicate in Spanish, so there I went. She\
  \ was traveling to Finland with her husband to attend their daughter\u2019s wedding.\
  \ It was their first long-distance flight and their seats were surprisingly next\
  \ to mine. And that\u2019s how I became a transatlantic expert.\nI knew which their\
  \ queue line was, how many juices someone could take from the trolley without being\
  \ charged, how people with specific diet requirements were first served and the\
  \ most comfortable position for a ten hours flight. I could have never imagined\
  \ that the trip I made inside that aircraft could be more interesting that the Niagara\
  \ Falls I had visited before. I got to teach them how to select a film, but as they\
  \ were narrating the stories they had been through as a couple, I realized I could\
  \ never forget the lessons they taught me.\nWe waved goodbye at the entrance of\
  \ their gate in Munich, to where I took them so they didn\u2019t get lost, as we\
  \ felt kind of sentimental. I was one step away from finally getting to Madrid,\
  \ and as I saw them disappearing from view, I was sure about two things: one of\
  \ my next transatlantic trips would be the pending one to Mexico and the headphones\
  \ provided by the air company were pretty good."
