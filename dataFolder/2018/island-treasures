Text: "Gently rocked awake I climbed out of bed and onto the deck in eager excitement.\
  \ \n\nThe sun hung low in the clear blue sky, dispersing golden flecks through the\
  \ last two remaining clouds and lighting up the Island. My gaze drifted from the\
  \ sky to the land. An endearing little wharf drew my eye-line in and towards the\
  \ palm tree lined shore. The water reflected the warmth of the morning sun, sparkling\
  \ and dancing with enticing enchantment.\nDon\u2019t let the size of this island\
  \ fool you, there is beauty and treasure around each corner. Arriving at the wharf\
  \ I relished the sound of feet hitting solid ground and breathed a deep breath of\
  \ Lifou Island air.\nRight behind the first curtain of trees laid some huts and\
  \ island locals. The little girls in their tightly braided dark hair and little\
  \ white sarongs hid shyly behind their mothers and giggled sweetly. A simple smile\
  \ and wave seemed to break every language and culture barrier. I felt immediately\
  \ that I loved this Island and this day long before 9am.\nAfter receiving a quick\
  \ tree-climbing lesson from one of the locals (which ended up with us both in stitches)\
  \ I ventured through the dirt paths overhung by rich greenery and thick rainforest.\
  \ The path led to an opening and I walked through in a silence created by awe and\
  \ wonder. In front of me lay stairs leading to the big blue hue, I followed them\
  \ like a woman under a spell.\nWhite sand squirmed through my toes as I waded out\
  \ into the bay in earnest expectation. Alone and still above the surface, yet a\
  \ bustling world below. Allowing the water to completely consume me I gazed through\
  \ the frame of my snorkels at the colourful world of the deep blue.\nI couldn\u2019\
  t possibly name all the breeds of fish, colours, coral and life I saw, namely because\
  \ I simply don\u2019t know what they are called.\nAfter hours of exploration I trekked\
  \ back through the dusty tracks; feet dirty, skin salty, heart full and a huge smile\
  \ on my face.\nI saw another track leading up to the top of a hill and decided to\
  \ take the path less travelled. \nArriving at the top, there before me was a beautiful\
  \ little church that overlooked most of the island, it was the last thing I expected\
  \ to see.\nI pictured the locals commuting here on a Sunday, echoes of deep strong\
  \ island voices filling the air, mothers and children dancing with jubilee.  I thought\
  \ to myself  \u2018Oh if only you could store memories instead of things little\
  \ church\u2019. \nLooking at the time it was 1pm; I wondered what else I would find\
  \ and what lay ahead."
