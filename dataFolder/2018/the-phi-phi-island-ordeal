Text: "My feet are hanging off the boat only a few feet from the ocean. I look up.\
  \ There it is! Phi Phi Island. I've only heard of this place; where The Beach was\
  \ filmed, where thousands of young travellers come together and celebrate this paradise\
  \ into bliss. In all of Thailand, this is the place where you truly let go and lose\
  \ yourself. \nAs the boat docked, I grabbed all my gear and walked onto the pier.\
  \ Looking around at the place, I couldn't help but smile to myself. This place was\
  \ so much more incredible than anything anyone could've described. I had no idea\
  \ where I was going to stay, so I just aimlessly walked around the little town's\
  \ cobble streets that branched out in all directions. \nThe vista was gorgeous,\
  \ and looking around, it was pretty easy to tell this wasn't a family vacation island.\
  \ The island was inhabited only by the youthful. Everyone on the island seemed to\
  \ be so good-looking, I was surprised they even let me on.\nI decided to try a fun,\
  \ little tactic my friend taught me for meeting people in Thailand. I walked over\
  \ to a couple girls, \u201CHey, do you mind watching my stuff while I jump in the\
  \ water for a quick swim?\u201D\n\u201COh yes, of course!\u201D\n\u201CThank you\
  \ so much!\u201D\nI jumped in the water for a while, and it's always surprisingly\
  \ warm. After fifteen minutes of taking the new location in, I swam back to the\
  \ girls.\n\u201CThanks for watching my stuff!\u201D\n\u201CYup, still here as promised,\u201D\
  \ they smiled.\n\u201CWhat's that accent?\u201D\n\u201CWe're from Germany!\u201D\
  \n\u201CGermany, nice! I'm from Canada. Jordan, pleasure to meet you both.\u201D\
  \n\u201CBianca, and my friend is Sophia.\u201D\n\u201CHow long have the both of\
  \ you been on the island? Any recommendations on things to do and see?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Shipwrecked! Definitely Shipwrecked. You have the wrist band. Did you go already?\u201D\
  \n\u201CNo, I'm booked for tomorrow morning.\u201D\n\u201CYou're going to love it!\u201D\
  \n\u201CDo you both have plans this evening? I hear this beach turns into quite\
  \ the party at night.\u201D\n\u201CYes definitely. Fire dancing, music, lots of\
  \ people drinking and having fun. We're going tonight, we think.\u201D\n\u201CWould\
  \ you like to meet up tonight, have a drink? You're the first people I've met here.\u201D\
  \n\u201CYes, that would be good. We could write each other on Facebook?\u201D\n\u201C\
  That's what I was thinking.\u201D"
