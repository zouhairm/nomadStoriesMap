Text: "I second-guessed myself when we reached the zip line launching platform. I\
  \ looked wearily at the cable that ran through a canyon above the winding Cetina\
  \ River. Could I really zip across this cable that\u2019s nearly as high as the\
  \ Space Needle in Seattle? I was in Omi\u0161, Croatia to experience a three-hour\
  \ long zip line excursion. The first course was the highest and longest\u2014it\
  \ was 590 feet high and 2,296 feet long. Besides zip lining, visitors flock to this\
  \ small central Dalmatian town for adventurous sports like rafting and rock climbing.\n\
  \nAs our pale and redheaded driver drove our group towards Mosor Mountain, he joked\
  \ that one of the guides today was high on drugs. But to mask his track marks, he\
  \ injects in his toes. \u201CDon\u2019t worry you probably won\u2019t die today,\u201D\
  \ he alluded to the incidents that happened the day before. Apparently, two people\
  \ died in the area. Two locals whispered about it before we got in the van.\n\n\
  We hiked up rugged hills to reach the first course. Once there, we saw rocky hills\
  \ speckled with trees and shrubbery all around us. The turquoise river twisting\
  \ in between the hills was hundreds of feet below. Further out, the outline of mountains\
  \ blended with the sky. After outfitting us in safety harnesses, one of the guides\
  \ zipped across to the second platform. \u201CThat noise is a good thing,\u201D\
  \ the guide with us said, referring to the high-pitched buzz that echoes as someone\
  \ glides across the cable. \u201CIf you don\u2019t hear it, you\u2019re either deaf\
  \ or dead.\u201D\n\nAlan, who I convinced to do this excursion with me, was the\
  \ first person to zip. He glided smoothly along the cable. But suddenly, there was\
  \ silence. The buzzing stopped.\n\nHe was stuck in the middle of the cable with\
  \ his arms stretched outright and legs dangling. The group watched nervously. The\
  \ guide told me Alan would have to pull himself to the other end. \u201CHe was braking\
  \ too soon,\u201D he said. After dangling in the air for a minute, Alan gained momentum\
  \ and grabbed the steel wire to hoist himself to the platform.\n\nI was next in\
  \ line to go. \u201CPlease don\u2019t mess this up,\u201D I chanted in my head while\
  \ getting harnessed. \u201CWhenever you\u2019re ready,\u201D the guide said after\
  \ securing me to the pulley. There was no way I could back out now. With one last\
  \ deep breath, I pushed myself forward.\n\nAll I heard was the wind and the buzzing\
  \ whistle. I kept my eyes wide open to admire the river and trees below my feet,\
  \ the hills beside me and how blue the sky was that day.\n\nI felt free. Free from\
  \ fear and anxiety."
