Text: "I was privileged to be sent to a tiny island nation-Kiribati to teach ten year\
  \ olds the English language for seven weeks.  Kiribati is pronounced like \u201C\
  kitty-bus.\u201D Most people don\u2019t know much about it, but google it, it\u2019\
  s fascinating.  On my way there, the moment I looked out the window of the plane\
  \ and saw the turquoise water, I knew I wanted to be out on the water.  Yes, ON\
  \ the water; I wanted to go fishing.  The year before in North Carolina was the\
  \ first time I had gone fishing, and I have never fallen in love with an odd-old\
  \ man sport so quickly.  It was like magic, being on a boat in the open water, waiting\
  \ patiently until you feel the tiny or if you\u2019re lucky, large pull of a fish\
  \ on the line.  Kiribati was one of my dream places to fish\u2026.. most Pacific\
  \ islanders fish before they learn to walk.  It\u2019s their way of life, so I was\
  \ on a mission to make friends who would take me out to fish.   It didn\u2019t come\
  \ easily, but finally week five I found people  from church\u2014the Tune family\
  \ offered to take me out on their boat.  The morning we were to set sail, they told\
  \ me to be ready to go by 5 AM, they came at 6:30 AM (island time easily defined\
  \ is 1.5 to 2 hours later than originally agreed upon).  I should have known, but\
  \ I was too excited to sleep in until 6 anyway.  All ready to go with our corned\
  \ beef and crackers, we set sail.  Brother Tune, as I affectionately called him,\
  \ told me to drop my line out into the water while we sailed out into the open ocean.\
  \  We caught a few tuna, nothing to brag about.  Finally when we dropped our anchor\
  \ it was the real deal.  Tutu, a relative of the Tune family and expert fisherwoman,\
  \ starting pulling up her line, but it wasn\u2019t easy to pull up this time.  She\
  \ reeled and reeled and finally emerged out of the water, a good sized, spikey,\
  \ HUMAN TOOTHED fish.  It\u2019s look was peculiar, but the sound it made was something\
  \ I would never expect to hear near the ocean.  It OINKED. I don't expect normalcy\
  \ any longer.\nIf you would like to see a photo of this fish and I, I will send\
  \ it in."
