Text: "Hidden in Oadby\u2019s neighbourhoods, the Botanic Garden of the University\
  \ of Leicester is an expansive place, nonetheless easy to miss. Living in Oadby\
  \ myself, I first discovered it on a friend\u2019s Instagram story. From the surrounding\
  \ streets, it is hardly visible. After 10 good minutes of walking around looking\
  \ for an entrance, I was finally able to get in. The place is exactly what you would\
  \ think of an English landscape garden. Footpaths going here and there through green\
  \ lawns, trees and ponds. The garden is divided in a few areas so subtly you barely\
  \ feel their presence. I thought for myself: this is a very quiet place! A few minutes\
  \ from Leicester city centre and you feel like in a countryside property. The old\
  \ Edwardian houses standing all around give even more strength to that sentiment.\
  \ But there is also a sound melancholia in that scenery. The huge mansions of red\
  \ bricks with their large checkered windows and proudly tall chimneys, although\
  \ perfectly kept, somehow speak like old ruins. An era of the English civilization\
  \ at its pinnacle has lived here and is now resting. That peaceful and historical\
  \ place is now home of a biological collection of plants and flowers which belongs\
  \ to the University. Anyone is however welcome in the garden. Most people wandering\
  \ around are just looking for a calm place to sit on a bench and read, old people\
  \ and families having a walk, and also some curious who can observe here the little\
  \ wonders of nature that everyone else fail to see. I had the chance to meet one\
  \ of them myself as I was there for a Sunday morning stroll. We were exploring the\
  \ garden our own pace, closing in each other a few times when we finally started\
  \ to talk in the \xABtropical House\xBB, one of the few themed greenhouses of the\
  \ Botanic Garden. Hilary also lives nearby and comes here because she is passionate\
  \ about nature and its diversity. She showed me different flowers and fruits such\
  \ as the giant lemons barely visible behind the large leaves of a very dense tree.\
  \ Her son is going to the same university and so we exchanged some general ideas\
  \ about education and how does such a place can be a useful tool to learn. We agreed\
  \ on how important it is to go out and see the physical life. \xAB Learning is also\
  \ a tactile experience \xBB she told me. I eventually left her with new ideas of\
  \ places to visit, feeling empowered by that encounter and the creative potential\
  \ of an apparently dormant place where people keep bringing in their living energy."
