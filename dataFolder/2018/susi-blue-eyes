Text: "Susi is an old Finnish man, with a thick grey beard and icy blue eyes, as cold\
  \ as the landscape that surrounds him. He wears layers and layers of fur, whose\
  \ colours go from white to grey to a faded brown. He could be one of those guardians\
  \ of the forest, older than the forest itself. Looking at his strong features and\
  \ peculiar choice of clothing, I find it hard to picture him performing a daily\
  \ activity, buying groceries, cooking, going to a doctor\u2019s appointment. \n\
  I meet Susi on my second day in Finland, which is also my second day suffering from\
  \ food poisoning. He owns a husky farm near Kuusamo and, believe it or not, his\
  \ name in Finnish means wolf. I am with a group of friends, who I met during my\
  \ Erasmus semester in Estonia. We take a ferry from Tallinn to Helsinki and then\
  \ a bus to Kuusamo. It is -4 \xB0F, I am wearing pretty much all the clothes I have\
  \ in my backpack, and I am nauseous and exhausted. I get off the bus and my legs\
  \ are buried in snow. I am already grieving over my wet socks, when I hear it. The\
  \ sound of hundreds of dogs barking. \nWe see Susi standing in the distance; we\
  \ soon find out that he is holding a new member of the pack, a newborn husky. As\
  \ I stare at the puppy, I am filled with many different emotions. Our goal here\
  \ is to successfully drive a husky sledge; but once we start playing with the dogs\
  \ it is quite hard to get back on track. We pair up, Susi gives us some basic instructions,\
  \ and we are on our own. \nI get on the sledge, push down with both feet on the\
  \ brakes and hold the handle bar tightly. All my muscles are tight. My whole body\
  \ hurts. I do not feel ready\u2026not at all. The dogs are excited. They are ready\
  \ to go. Everything happens fast, I jump and my feet move to the sideboards. The\
  \ dogs start running at full speed. They seem to know their way but I have to control\
  \ the sledge so that we do not crash against a tree. I feel overwhelmed. There are\
  \ too many things to remember. Keeping the balance of the sledge while trying not\
  \ to get us injured is hard enough. Suddenly, there is a hill, and the dogs stop\
  \ in their tracks. We are too heavy. I review the instructions in my mind: get off\
  \ the boards and run uphill until the dogs can do it on their own. It seems dangerous.\
  \ What if the dogs start running too fast and I fall off the sledge? \n3\n2\n1\n\
  My heart is pounding. Adrenaline rushes through my veins. I look at the dogs. My\
  \ dogs. Susi is looking at me. His eyes are not cold anymore."
