Text: "Missing Lisbon at first sight. Lisbon locks you in the present. Lisbon interprets\
  \ the present as an endless d\xE9j\xE0-vu. Lisbon is the already-past.\n\nI already\
  \ miss Lisbon, I tell Lois, his shadow sheltering me from the resentful brightness\
  \ of the Tagus. His grin gets lost in a baby\u2019s cry on the other side of the\
  \ ferry. We stop in Barreiro. Riccardo lives in Verderena, he says, not too far.\
  \ We see Riccardo already waving with a tanned smile while we go outside the ferry\
  \ station.\n\nI don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going. I met the two only yesterday.\
  \ Riccardo talks with a heavy Italian accent. He asks Lois when he\u2019ll be back\
  \ in Berlin and suddenly turns, asking me why I live in Glasgow. My answer falls\
  \ on the ground, which is asking all my attention: we are walking through an unexpected\
  \ slum, hidden behind a predictable periphery. We avoid piles of trash, people washing\
  \ in plastic tubs, dogs sit under broken chairs, silences despite our bom dia(s).\
  \ We cross discontinuous concrete castings on bridges made of rotten wooden planks.\n\
  \nFernando\u2019s shack is a restaurant, Lois whispers: people book an afternoon\
  \ and pay just enough to cover the basic expenses \u2013 just fish and fuel for\
  \ the boat, Fernando specifies. He pours a citrusy liqueur in a used cup: you\u2019\
  ll be ready to swim then, he convinces me. Riccardo and Lois test the water. We\
  \ swim together, dreaming of reaching Tagus\u2019 opposite shore. We swim among\
  \ anchored boats, underwater ropes, slimy boas. We resign ourselves to the weakness\
  \ of our lungs, laughing, back on the shore. We compare the scratches we collected\
  \ on our legs.\n\nFernando grabs my arm and drags me around his restaurant, dripping\
  \ salty water that smells like naphtha. There are only a few concrete walls: all\
  \ the others are metal plates. A radio transmits Fado. I recognize \u2018Loucura\u2019\
  , and other songs I\u2019ve no time to name \u2013 Fernando is talking fast: For\
  \ two years I was a footballer in America (the main room is filled with old pictures).\
  \ All the fadistas and important people I served (album covers close to side profiles\
  \ in black and white, flowery fonts celebrating fame and hits of the past). They\
  \ wrote a song for me and the restaurant, too (a hymn to desolation: we are all\
  \ here, claiming a somewhere-else). \n\nSaudade is the irony aftertaste of the southern\
  \ placid anger, come out in sounds of a peculiar rusty sensuality. It\u2019s love,\
  \ and an acceptance for loneliness. Missing something that isn\u2019t gone yet and\
  \ that one day will be long gone. The present."
