Text: "India had been calling me for years; the culture, the food, the colliding contrasts\
  \ between the ancient world and the modern one, was both intriguing and frightening\
  \ at the same time. One of the worlds most densely populated countries, there is\
  \ an abundance of crime and unimaginable poverty; I had never been exposed to anything\
  \ like it in my sheltered, safe life in the U.S.\nLanding in Delhi, the first thing\
  \ that hit me was the smell. The air is filled with a visible brown cloud that smells\
  \ like a mixture of burning cow dung, fuel exhaust, curry spices, and terrible body\
  \ odor, it's a smell that has left its mark never to be forgotten. The amazing contrasts\
  \ of old and new collided on the streets of Delhi. There's  a strange mixture of\
  \ modern cars and buses, human-pulled rickshaws, camel pulled carts, and elephants\
  \ heavily loaded with cargo. Not to mention all of the shoeless children hawking\
  \ their wares while weaving in and out of all of this mayhem.\nFrom Delhi, I traveled\
  \ by bus to Dharamsala, a 12-hour ride up a perilous snaking road with sheer cliffs\
  \ on both sides of the road, one going up, the other straight down to the river\
  \ hundreds of feet below. To say I was frightened would be an understatement. But\
  \ eventually, I gave in to the experience and decided to trust the process, come\
  \ what may. \nWe arrived safely in Dharamsala and the Tibetan colony, nestled at\
  \ the base of the snow-capped Himalayan mountains, such a different scene from the\
  \ one left behind in the bustling streets of Delhi. It was here that I would call\
  \ home for the next three months while living and working in the colony, teaching\
  \ Tibetan monks to improve their English skills. \nThe beautiful gifts that I carried\
  \ away from my time there are the love and friendship that was freely and genuinely\
  \ given to me by the Tibetan and Indian people. While I thought I was going to share\
  \ my gifts, what I received back was so much more than I ever could have imagined.\
  \ Most Tibetans and Indians that I encountered there have very little in the way\
  \ of worldly possessions, yet they have more love and depth of presence than most\
  \ people I know who have everything in the world of physicality. This contrast has\
  \ given me a whole new meaning of true poverty, which has nothing to do with physical\
  \ possessions, but everything to do with the lack of happiness and joy. \nIndia\
  \ opened not only my eyes, it opened and broke my heart while giving me so much\
  \ to think about and be grateful for. I will be back. Namaste."
