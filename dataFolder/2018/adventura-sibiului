Text: "Since my first moments here in Sibiu i destinguish alot of things totally different\
  \ of where i arrived in Bucharest, I always believe that cities has soul and taste,\
  \ everywhere we go we experience new life should live it fully the same like loclas\
  \ otherwise you're a tourist for a fewdays will just watch and enjoy luxury lifestyle,\
  \ But will not get the right to judge nothing or tell more than some information\
  \ about places you visit .\n\n\nAlthough Sibiu is not big city but located in a\
  \ huge and historical area which called  Transylvania, where i found many things\
  \ interesting to follow in the people lifestyle and behaviour or integrating into\
  \ society, Maybe communicate to locals is really easy cause people there used to\
  \ meet strangers.\n\n\nBack to the historic centru where the ancient city wall,\
  \ towers and Pia\u021Ba Mare where i really wonder almost daily, Although it's can\
  \ be seen as typical city center but i found the Romanian culture is so expressive\
  \ on the buildings, shops, restaurants and cafes which is not resemble other countries\
  \ specially when it comes to the point where i need to talk to the people where\
  \ they are friendly and wonderful when they try to teach me Romanian language if\
  \ they doesn't speak English .\n\n\n\nEveryone focus on or looks for different things,\
  \ As one Persian philosopher (Jalaluddin Rumi) \u201CWhat you search for..is looking\
  \ for you\u201D so it's not always complicated as people thinks, I was searching\
  \ for nature and art where I definitely found here in Sibiu or Romania, depending\
  \ on each area where it's taste different .\n\n\n\nWhen i focused on the culture\
  \ here i found few common things between with my culture like the Backgammon game\
  \ (Joc de table) or the Halva and Shawarma, starting by the food and how the people\
  \ spend there free time, As example i start to know the Gogosi and covrigi time\
  \ on the midday time with coffee or maybe a beer depends on the weather, Also some\
  \ people goes to bet shops and spend time maybe win some money, which's not exist\
  \ back home in Egypt and also illegal.\n\nSo it's very inspiration for me to be\
  \ here in a totally different place which seems as a natural protectorate within\
  \ the city also to try new lifestyle .\n\nI like airports and train stations also\
  \ prefer to live near them, That's makes me happy and give me hope about travelling,\
  \ And sometime i think that life is a trip where we meet other people and share\
  \ everything and finally build our life and experience ."
