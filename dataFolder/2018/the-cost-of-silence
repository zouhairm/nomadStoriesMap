Text: "At exactly 6 PM I take stock. I\u2019m balled up in the bed. My face is wet\
  \ with tears. There is still half an hour to go before the dinner gong, so I suppose\
  \ I will just cry some more.\n\nIt is Day 4 of a 15-day meditation retreat at a\
  \ Tibetan monastery in Kathmandu. Their website had promised the retreat will help\
  \ me cultivate loving-kindness, compassion, sympathetic joy and equanimity. None\
  \ of them seems to have developed in me yet. I just want to go back home, or somewhere,\
  \ anywhere, that I\u2019m loved.\n\nOn Day 1, a tall Austrian man introduced our\
  \ teacher, a monk from the Czech Republic. \u201COh, by the way, this is a silent\
  \ retreat,\u201D he finished. I reeled.\n\nThe scope of the silence is exhaustive.\
  \ We cannot communicate even via gestures or make eye contact. Nobody enforces the\
  \ rules, though. Within a few days, the participants were chattering, and I unexpectedly\
  \ got left out. The only other English speaker is an octogenarian who enjoys playing\
  \ tug with the monastery\u2019s resident dogs. I have not managed to make friends\
  \ with the dogs, so I take to crying in my room instead.\n\nThe food is a comfort.\
  \ The meals are prepared with love and range from thukpa to enchiladas. My favourite\
  \ is breakfast - rotis with as much peanut butter you can slather on.\n\nOn Day\
  \ 5, the monk asks us to visualise a person we admire. I think he means a monk or\
  \ nun but I do not know any, so I picture Emma Watson and meditate.\n\nWe meditate\
  \ for about 6.5 hours daily. During the breaks, if I\u2019m not crying, I walk downhill\
  \ to Boudhanath. The stupa is expansive in its embrace of the valley. The market\
  \ has crowded in from all sides, sometimes leaving only a narrow path to walk on.\
  \ A shop plays Om Mani Padme Hum on loop. I mutter the chant as I circumambulate.\n\
  \nOn Day 8, we go to Swayambhu, a stupa atop a hill, also known as the Monkey Temple.\
  \ We trek into the forests that cover the hill, and settle in a clearing to meditate,\
  \ monkeys notwithstanding.\n\nOver dinner, the participants discuss qigong, an activity\
  \ I have unfailingly slept through every morning. A Hong Kongese lady invites me\
  \ to join in. As an Indian, I am expected have sufficient knowledge of yoga to draw\
  \ intelligent parallels between the two. I smile serenely, not willing to break\
  \ my silence or expose my ignorance.\n\nOn Day 13, I wake up disoriented by oddly\
  \ vivid dreams. In one, I was dying. The other involved parturition. A quick internet\
  \ search reveals that both dreams symbolise new beginnings.\n\nI shrug and proceed\
  \ to breakfast."
