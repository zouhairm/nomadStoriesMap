Text: "Last September, I heard the news that the Navajo Generating Station was slated\
  \ for closure. The coal plant was the biggest employer in the Navajo Nation for\
  \ over 50 years. \n\nI found myself traveling down the U.S. 160 West, the U.S, owned\
  \ interstate that cuts through the Nation. After fours years living in Arizona,\
  \ I had yet to drive through the vast Navajo Nation. Asking for addresses is unique\
  \ as most places don\u2019t have street names. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m 20 miles south\
  \ of the mine,\u201D Percy Deal, my stranger, said when I called him to meet. I\
  \ asked for more specifics on his location and finally agreed to meet at the town\u2019\
  s McDonalds. \n\nI was given Deal\u2019s number, a retired Navajo county supervisor,\
  \ through Dine CARE, a Navajo environmental advocacy organization. Many were losing\
  \ their jobs if, or when, the coal industry left, but some saw the exit as a blessing.\
  \ Deal was one of them. \n\nDeal said the coal industry has only brought his community\
  \ challenges. \n\nWith the coal industry on its way out it may leave behind what\u2019\
  s left of the Navajo Aquifer, the source of water for Deal and his fellow Black\
  \ Mesa residents. \n\nDeal, like almost all members of the Black Mesa community,\
  \ has lived in his family home for generations but has no running water. He had\
  \ no plans to leave but had every hope the community would regain control of their\
  \ aquifer.\n\nDeal offered to show me Peabody Kayenta Mine and I followed behind,\
  \ curious to see this evil coal mine who dirtied his water. The mine sat on top\
  \ of a large hill. I looked down at the valley and followed the coal slurry. It\
  \ resembled an out-of-service roller coaster. It looked sad. Hardly an evil being,\
  \ but a relic of the past.\n\nI thought of the employees who would lose their jobs,\
  \ but I also thought of the others in Navajo Nation who would regain their land.\
  \ The coal industry was on its way out, and lives were shifting. I stood above it\
  \ and realized I knew nothing of these people. My neighbors. \n\n\u201CI\u2019d\
  \ just like for the communities when they turn their faucets on, I want them to\
  \ think about \u2018where is the water coming from?\u2019\u201D Deal said.  \u201C\
  It starts with coal brought to the power plant that brings the power that allows\
  \ for running water. We want some appreciation back to us.\u201D\n\nAs I got ready\
  \ for bed that night I squeezed toothpaste on my toothbrush, turned on the sink\
  \ and watched the water run. And I thought of Percy Deal."
