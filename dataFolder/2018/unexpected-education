Text: "Lying in bed, every time I closed my eyes I heard children shouting \u201C\
  Teacher! Teacher! Teacher!\u201D Their tiny hands grabbing me and pulling me down\
  \ to hell.\n\nI\u2019m not quite sure how it happened \u2014 one minute I\u2019\
  m exploring India \u2014 the next I have a job in Thailand where children bite me.\
  \ It started with a brief trip to Bangkok to refresh my visa for India and I find\
  \ a sweet potato in the supermarket. It wasn\u2019t any old sweet potato though\
  \ \u2014 this was a Japanese Beni Haruka slowly roasted over hot stones. The result\
  \ is part vegetable part dessert and was enough to make me decide to stay longer.\
  \ I\u2019ve always had a love affair with food in Thailand. It\u2019s just so exciting,\
  \ all of it, every single thing is shiny and delicious.\n\nThe TESOL course had\
  \ been on my mind for a while and was the perfect excuse to stay in Bangkok \u2014\
  \ and that\u2019s how I found myself teaching. To say it was last minute is an understatement.\
  \ I booked the course at 3am the same day it started. Arriving in the morning I\
  \ was feeling pretty good until I took my seat and looked around. Everyone was wearing\
  \ a shirt and tie\u2026 except me of course, I was wearing the smells of India \u2014\
  \ two months worth. I think everyone was a bit confused who I was, obviously not\
  \ a student as I wasn\u2019t prepared, not a teacher\u2026 perhaps a homeless man\
  \ who'd wandered in.\n\nAfter a good haircut, a trip to the tailor, a month of diligent\
  \ study and sampling every type of sweet sticky rice known to man I was now a qualified\
  \ teacher. Armed with my laminated certificate I thought I\u2019d put the spare\
  \ two weeks I had to use with some real world experience. Fortunately one of the\
  \ teachers in a nearby school had walked out, unable to take it any longer. Perhaps\
  \ this should have been an obvious warning but I was excited. Well, I was terrified\
  \ but excited sounds better. \n\nAnd so, the next day I find myself confronted with\
  \ room after room of screaming children. Some eager to learn. Some fascinated by\
  \ the hairs on my hand. Some a bit bitey.\n\nAt times I felt like a teaching god,\
  \ perfectly managing the class like a conductor with an orchestra. But it was fragile,\
  \ an enthusiastic word game on the white board quickly became a riot with one child\
  \ grabbing my leg and the crowd snatching my marker to write their words on the\
  \ board. At least they were involved I suppose.\n\nMy two weeks now over, I\u2019\
  m sleeping again and the night terrors have gone. I\u2019ll give teaching the proper\
  \ chance it deserves, just with more realistic expectations and perhaps a rabies\
  \ shot."
