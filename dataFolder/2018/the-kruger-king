Text: "His hand reached into the purple glossy chip packet \u2013 atop a rough tree\
  \ trunk within the sandy rolling plains and dewy-green tufts of early spring grass,\
  \ it seemed harshly artificial. Three hours since beginning our 5:30am bushwalk\
  \ in Kruger National Park, we were hungry; the chips were nearly gone. Themba, our\
  \ guide, casually munched one before answering my question. \u201CI have seen everything\
  \ you could imagine. Everything.\u201D Under the brim of a frayed baseball cap,\
  \ his eyes looked straight ahead; I couldn\u2019t tell if he was joking. He didn\u2019\
  t let me find out \u2013 folding away the now-empty chip packet, his eyes turned\
  \ to his rifle resting by our makeshift snack table. He hoisted the rifle in his\
  \ arms and began swaying it side to side, then abruptly pausing and holding it stock\
  \ still. He was practising his aim. Despite the sun's growing warmth, I felt chilled.\
  \ Themba\u2019s requirements were a long way from suburban life \u2013 we were to\
  \ walk strictly in single file, not wear white clothing, not talk, and click our\
  \ fingers if we absolutely had to say something.\n\u201CWe go now,\u201D was all\
  \ Themba needed to say, gun at his front, for the six of us to quickly file behind\
  \ him and begin following his quick strides. But we didn\u2019t have to hurry; Themba\
  \ had suddenly stopped and I almost ran into him. He wasn't pulling out a packet\
  \ of chips this time though. Rather, he was furiously waving a clenched fist that\
  \ meant \"get down\". A ragged ginger mane had popped up from a grass thicket 20-odd\
  \ metres away. It took only an eye blink to recognize the animal who wore it, and\
  \ then a second scruff of ginger reared up. Two male lions, eyes glaring golden,\
  \ turned their attention to us. I dropped my face to the red dirt, but locked my\
  \ eyes on the presence before us. Themba raised his rifle to eye level, aiming the\
  \ barrel. \"Click\". But as the weapon cocked, the lions sprung from the thicket\
  \ and dashed towards the grass plains further afield. Their raw power obvious from\
  \ the flexing of their muscles, their black-tufted tails flicking to balance their\
  \ gait, I couldn\u2019t differentiate my feelings of awe and confusion. The king\
  \ of the jungle was running from dumbfounded tourists whose only defence was at\
  \ the hands of a potato chip-loving local. Yet here, Themba ruled. As the lions\
  \ slinked out of view, Themba lowered his gun. He turned his head to us \u2013 controlled,\
  \ steady. \u201CYou should\u2019ve seen what happened last week,\u201D he smirked,\
  \ hoisting the rifle on his shoulder once more and readjusting his fraying cap."
