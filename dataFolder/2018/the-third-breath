Text: "First breath. \nIt smells like the rushing water below me. I reach my head\
  \ over the railing, a little further out than it should be. I was afraid but I wasn't\
  \ scared. \nSecond breath.\nI'm over the railing now and I focus on gently untying\
  \ my hair. The strands are spun from gold but my heart is reaply sewed. \n\"Julia!\"\
  \ I hear someone yell my name from behind. \nThird breath. \nAs I stare at the water,\
  \ I see something. No, I see many things. It is on this breath, this one small breath,\
  \ that I begin to see the world. \nI am walking between rugged buildings who have\
  \ colors that scream at me. \"Stop that!\" I yell, frightened, but I learn to like\
  \ it. They guide me to what looks like a dome that boulders over in a way that makes\
  \ me feel the most powerless. The aroma of croissants and cappuccinos fill my nostrils\
  \ and within seconds I am hovering over a new scene. \nI have become subdued by\
  \ a bitter chilling and I find a cup in my palm. It is warm and so I sip it. My\
  \ mouth explodes with a drooling river of sweet cocoa but I am too distracted by\
  \ the flurry that surrounds me. I stand atop a mountain, and scream at the tops\
  \ of my lungs. My voice echoes throughout but the tall bearded men around me do\
  \ not seem to notice. One comes up to me and offers me his hand. Without thinking,\
  \ I take it. \nThe man is suddenly smaller in stature but his smile does not fade.\
  \ He spins me by my hand and I fall into different arms. \n\"Smile, laddy!\" He\
  \ shouts over loud music. The building I am in is filled to the brim and the noise\
  \ of laughter erodes through my soul in the most synergistic way. \nAnd so I dance.\
  \ I dance not because they tell me to, but because they don't tell me to stop. They\
  \ clap and holler as I bounce on my feet, and suddenly all is still. All is still\
  \ except for the rushing river below me. \nFourth breath.\n\"Julia!\" I hear again.\
  \ \"I'm begging you to stop!\" \nAll I could do is grab the railing tighter. I was\
  \ scared, but I wasn't afraid. I had always heard stories of people seeing their\
  \ past memories before they are about to die. But I had envisioned my future, and\
  \ I realized that I had almost given up the world that would teach me how to live.\
  \ \nAnd so I laughed and I took a jump. It wasn't off that bridge, however. It was\
  \ more of a leap-- a leap back to this life that I had not yet experienced. The\
  \ countries slapped me in my face, and I thanked them for it. \nAnd so I did not\
  \ kill myself."
