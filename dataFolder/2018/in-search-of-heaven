Text: "In search of heaven\nRain water dripped down my visor as I stood their completed\
  \ soaked gazing at the mud trail framed by lush green bushes and trees, it was raining\
  \ cats and dogs as if someone had torn the sky apart. I slowly turned back around\
  \ and faced the range officer who stood there explaining to our group why even the\
  \ best jeeps hadn\u2019t dared to go up the trail in weeks as the mud and rock trail\
  \ would be very unstable and could lead to a disastrous slide down the Cliffside.\
  \ At that moment out of the blue the profound meaning of the name \u2018Malnad\u2019\
  \ hit me, \u201CMalnad\u201D literally meaning \u201CThe land of rains\u201D.\n\
  I stood their mutely listening to the ranging hot debate that sparked as soon as\
  \ the ranger officer left us to decide our fates whether to continue or turn back.\
  \ Two of them urged to take up the risk and the other two advised caution, suddenly\
  \ the debate came to a halt and all were looking at me for the tie breaker, I stood\
  \ there looking at each of them in turn and I came to a decision and I said \u2018\
  We haven\u2019t traveled hundreds of kilometers riding through harsh winds, dust\
  \ and rain to turn back at the final step of destination, the last step that\u2019\
  s going to test our skill, mantel and our trust in ourselves, our friendship and\
  \ our bikes, the bikes we know so dearly as no other man could ever know it. I for\
  \ one am not going to turn around now but its left up to you to decide whether to\
  \ go on and reach the peak of \u201CKodchadri\u201D or go back.\u2019 Within fifteen\
  \ minutes the bikes engines were roaring with their riders on top of them. The ride\
  \ up the trail was as dangerous as the officer had described with slick muddy unstable\
  \ trail with lots of loose rocks and surrounded by the ever existing fog which caused\
  \ poor visibility, but still we held on to a steady progress with few small instances\
  \ but none life threatening and after three hours of hard riding we reached the\
  \ thousand two hundred year old \u2018Shankar peta\u2019(temple), after paying our\
  \ respects we resumed our journey and with a few short minutes we were at the peak\
  \ which offered us a view that took our breath away, the fog and clouds covered\
  \ every square inch from one end of the horizon to the other end, and this mass\
  \ of clouds were moving at steady progress as if we were on a island surrounded\
  \ by a sea of clouds. The last thing I expected was the heavenly beauty of Mother\
  \ Nature to make me realize that heaven was neither above nor below us rather it\
  \ is here on earth with us."
