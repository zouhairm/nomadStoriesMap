Text: "They were jolly old gentlemen on an excursion in the fields. Decked in three-piece\
  \ suits, dark bow ties and tiny jaunty hats. Comical. \nMembers of the Flensburg\
  \ Gestapo, the caption read. It was the kind of thing that made you look twice.\
  \ \n\nI was on the last leg of my trip to Berlin and had stopped at the Topography\
  \ of Terrors \u2013 a museum on Niederkirchnerstrasse. Site of the Gestapo and SS\
  \ headquarters during the Nazi regime. Outside, the bare trees, steely gravel and\
  \ bleak buildings were a precursor. Inside, the monochrome photographs immortalized\
  \ the worst. \n\nOrthodox Jews herded through the city center.\nA political opponent\
  \ publicly humiliated and made to sit on an ox, with a cardboard sign around his\
  \ neck proclaiming his betrayal of the people.\nGerman women with their heads shaven\
  \ and paraded after being accused of intimate contact with prisoners of war. \n\
  One installation is just an array of faces -- political prisoners interrogated at\
  \ the Gestapo HQ in 1933. I looked through their offences. In the line-up were:\
  \ communists, socialists, social democrats, union activists, authors, journalists,\
  \ artists, musicians, clergy and liberals.\n(And then they came for me.) \n\nAt\
  \ 21, Berlin was my first solo travel experience and my first time venturing beyond\
  \ Asia. I came for the cityscapes I saw on a Google Image search. For the currywurst,\
  \ gl\xFChwein and apfelstrudel. What I found was grittier. Against the bright rebellion\
  \ of spray wars and the concrete stelae of heartache, I stored up factoids like\
  \ currency. Mysterious things like how the pink pipes carried untreated sewage water\
  \ and the blue ones carried clean water. Or how there is a badly pitted section\
  \ of the Berlin Wall left over in Niederkirchnerstrasse, thanks to the Mauerspechte\
  \ or Wall Woodpeckers \u2013 people who hacked away with chisels and hammers for\
  \ souvenirs they could sell. \n\nNot far away was the tumult of Berlin Fashion Week,\
  \ across the street from Humboldt University. In 1933, some 20,000 books from the\
  \ university library were classified as \u2018un-German\u2019 and burned by Nazi\
  \ paramilitaries. Much later, they erected a memorial to the book-burning. A glass\
  \ panel in the cobbled street looks into a white underground room with empty shelf\
  \ spaces for the 20,000 burned books. A plaque nearby reads: \"That was only a prelude;\
  \ where they burn books, they ultimately burn people\". The chilling words of Heinrich\
  \ Heine in 1820, over a century before they eventually came to pass.\n\nTo be here,\
  \ is to bear witness."
