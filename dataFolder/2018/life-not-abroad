Text: "Norfolk: not the most glamourous of locations when you think about a holiday.\
  \ Not so exotic or mystifying or pretty to gaze at images of in a \"wish I was there\"\
  \ type way. But a place of character all the same. Why am I choosing this as a place\
  \ to write about? In a competition most likely packed with tales of Hawaii, Thailand,\
  \ New York...? \nWell...\nBecause it isn't obviously glamourous or hyped up in travel\
  \ brochures. And it is a pleasant location for a small getaway, whether you are\
  \ from the UK or elsewhere in the world.\nNorfolk has pleasant beach towns such\
  \ as Wells by the Sea, where you can walk right out to the beach itself or take\
  \ a cute little train ride and walk miles on sand while looking out to blue waters.\
  \ It has quaint countryside towns where you're always guaranteed to find a friendly\
  \ tea shop or local to settle in for a pint by an open fire... It has Norwich which\
  \ is no London but carries a lot of the same atmosphere of London, it's interesting\
  \ and eventful in it's own right.\nThe Tomblands and Cathedral area carry a medieval\
  \ presence in the middle of modern day Subways/Starbucks territory... And if you\
  \ dig around beyond M&S and H&M you might just find Inanna's Festival, one of those\
  \ witchy, spellbook and candle type shops lifted out of something like The Craft.\n\
  People are pleasant and welcoming in varied ways in Norfolk, some cheerfully saying\
  \ hello in passing on walks in the lush green countryside. Others may engage you\
  \ in urban tales on ventures around the city.\nNorfolk isn't glamourous like abroad\
  \ but it has its own broads, which are very impressive. And any amount of homely\
  \ country cottages and log cabins at reasonable prices where you can escape from\
  \ light pollution and revel in the luxury of clear night skies, waking to sights\
  \ of all kinds of wildlife bouncing around at sunrise. It has long winding roads\
  \ some of which can look challenging to say the least, yet easier than they look.\n\
  Give it a try, see if you like It, not for the \"epic holiday of a lifetime\", but\
  \ certainly for the \"holiday I needed to get away from everything and reset my\
  \ senses\".\nSometimes a holiday close to home but just that different enough to\
  \ feel far away is exactly what the mind, body and soul needs and from personal\
  \ experience I came away from a week in Norfolk, looking 5 years younger so there's\
  \ most likely some truth in what they say about that fresh country air.\nWrap up,\
  \ get out every day & plan that holiday abroad next time. Enjoy Norfolk."
