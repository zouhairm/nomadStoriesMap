Text: "I found my inner traveler in the dark.\n\nExpecting all cave-related fears:\
  \ spiders, bats, tiny spaces, leeches - would further my already growing notion\
  \ that I was a failed traveller on my first-ever trip abroad, I instead found the\
  \ falsity of my idolizations. \n\nThe first night of the tour was spent on Cheow\
  \ Lan Lake. I was faced with a dream; an ancient forest flooded to create an artificial\
  \ lake; pronouncing new language for beauty - karsts. \n\nCross-legged on the dock\
  \ in front of my floating bungalow, I wondered at what I lacked language for. The\
  \ sadness was tectonic, bolder from the rain - solidified. \n\nI couldn\u2019t text\
  \ a friend my anxieties and let her know I was okay - there was no reception. I\
  \ wondered what I would say when I got home - how I would share this. What I would\
  \ not want to say: on the most beautiful lake I read Virginia Woolf aggressively\
  \ on the dock and clung to her words, trying to escape the way water reflected the\
  \ grey sky mixed with projected self-doubt.\n\nAfter an hour of being rushed by\
  \ our impatient guide through the dank jungle, we reach Namthalu cave.\n \nOur headlamps\
  \ shine weak beams of light on their own. When anything shares our attention - a\
  \ spider the size of our tour-guide\u2019s hand -- we see less of its contours and\
  \ its presence is diminished. My field of vision is shrunken to the smallest of\
  \ frames; crowd of crickets blanketing the dry rock, a bat dangling in slumber.\
  \ \n\nMy idea of the traveler was someone living in a constant state of wonder.\
  \ Like a song I love called \u201CThe Traveler,\u201D they have \u201Clight in their\
  \ room,\u201D light for possibility.  \n\nIn the cave, thought loses certainty and\
  \ the clashing echoes distill sound. The water - cold and loud on our humid skin\
  \ - is bronze and cloudy. Every step is slippery and the walls we grip for balance\
  \ are slick and shiny. \n\nNothing and everything are visible here. I can scarcely\
  \ see my own body, except in increments. I shake, nervous and prepared to slip.\
  \ I pause. There could be leeches on my legs right now. I look down towards my lifted\
  \ leg and try to penetrate the water with my light, turning my knee this way and\
  \ that, inspecting. \n\nThe song reminds us that we need darkness to see what night\
  \ holds.\n\nWe walk until we are submerged, treading the deepest point of the river.\
  \ My dry-bag bobs next to my head.\n\nI sigh, relieved in knowing nothing awaits\
  \ me except light, that to travel is merely motion, and that in water, in any darkness,\
  \ there is agency, and maybe, the chance to be present."
