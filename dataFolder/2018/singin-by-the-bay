Text: "From beneath the clouds, the massive disk of green islands looked like emeralds\
  \ stuck in the ocean. \nLanding on the best airport in the world, the 13 year old\
  \ girl found her footing on a foreign land. The air spoke of the food, a different\
  \ language and the sheer excitement of some place new even though it\u2019s just\
  \ 5 hours away from home. Although, Singapore is 2 hours and 30 minutes ahead of\
  \ India, for the young girl it was like watching her life through the crystal ball\
  \ while passing building touching the sky, lit up by a thousand lights. There was\
  \ a new thump in the air, or maybe a Maserati passing by with a woofer system knocking\
  \ the windows down.\n Hitting the streets of Singapore, specially Orchard  Road,\
  \ Asia\u2019s most famous shopping street was now going to be a salvation to our\
  \ famished souls. Carrot cakes in straw bowls and fresh Dragon fruit, contradicted\
  \ the Michelin star restaurants to that of the hawker type environment.\n The desk\
  \ manager of our hotel whom I had made a friend of Jing Yi specifically said \u2018\
  try the pork bao, it is spicy!\u2019. Though my Indian taste buds would have devoured\
  \ the bun in minutes, I took a less spicy route to scrambled eggs and cereal. Since\
  \ who knows what the day calls to, we headed to Chinatown.  \n The shophouses make\
  \ a scenic walk to the Buddha Tooth Relic Temple where the air smelled of fresh\
  \ lavender and something holy. This gigantic 4 storied temple housed a huge gold\
  \ Buddha, a tea caf\xE9 on the second floor and a sacred relic on the 4th floor.\
  \ Chinatown is where the old Singapore lives, crispy duck on food carts and huge\
  \ shopping street markets where you can buy miniature waving cats or some glimmering\
  \ silk robes. Smith Street is famous for the food carts and shops where as Pagoda\
  \ Street is definitely for Chinese teacups. \nJing Yi apparently has a 12 year old\
  \ son who was more than a willing volunteer as his summer break was still going\
  \ on and shared quite a passion for food. \u2018Chicken  Laksa on the streets are\
  \ nothing, my mom makes it so much better\u2019 he says and the Indian girl sighed\
  \ a bit for his dimples saying \u2018Why don\u2019t you bring us some?\u2019. Well,\
  \ the boy wasn\u2019t kidding. It was the best chicken coconut soup she had ever\
  \ had. The girl had made a new friend, who might be within a week or two be eating\
  \ a different dinner from her's. Jing Yi and his son brought us much more than just\
  \ the Laksa, they brought love and culture served on a platter. He said ' come here\
  \ during winters, we'll make you the best rum cake in the world'."
