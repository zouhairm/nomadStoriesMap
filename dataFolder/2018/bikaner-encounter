Text: "\u201CUrgh.\u201D I shudder audibly. The chalky, dull taste of yellow lentils\
  \ mixed with plain rice curdles round my tongue as I gum on it like a fussy infant.\
  \ My medically mandated meal is dahl and rice, and I can barely disguise the revulsion\
  \ on my face - is this not the exact same shade of bile expelled rather spectacularly\
  \ from the depths of my soul not 2 hours ago? Three loud taps on the rickety door\
  \ split the air and rouse me from my trance. Maesh, the middle-aged doorman sticks\
  \ his head in and says gruffly \u201CYou eat. I come back and we go hospital.\u201D\
  \ He\u2019s gone as quickly as he arrived.\n\nIt\u2019s day 6 of my organised tour\
  \ and the plan is to explore the iconic golden city of Jaisalmer and soak up the\
  \ magnificent beauty of its fort from a rowboat on the lake. Indeed, that\u2019\
  s exactly how it plays out \u2013 just not for me. My 14 travelling companions have\
  \ moved on and I\u2019m forced to remain in a dusty Rajasthani town, so nuclear\
  \ is the nature of my gastric-pyrotechnics. This was supposed to be my time to chase\
  \ adventure, to encounter first hand the riot of colour and bustle for which India\
  \ is famous. Instead, I find myself doubled over in an auto rickshaw, careening\
  \ onto a dirty concrete bridge overlooking a vast urban landscape below. Endless\
  \ piles of plastic litter the narrow streets and a heady mix of diesel, cow-pats\
  \ and assorted rotting garbage permeate the scarf over my mouth.\n\nKothari hospital\
  \ is clear across town. Maesh sits in the front seat with the auto-rickshaw driver,\
  \ chattering away. I am surprised that he has come with me, but figure he sees it\
  \ as an opportunity to take a break from running errands all over the hotel. We\
  \ reach the hospital and, to my astonishment, Maesh leads me inside, marches straight\
  \ up to the front desk and demands that I see a doctor. There\u2019s literally hundreds\
  \ of people waiting, but within minutes, I\u2019m harried into and out of the chambers,\
  \ prescriptions are written and filled, and we exit the hospital, an assortment\
  \ of medications tucked under Maesh\u2019s arm. He hands me a bottle of water and\
  \ the first of many antibiotics. \u201CYou take now. Then again tonight before food\
  \ this one, wait half hour, after, do this one.\u201D He\u2019s made the auto driver\
  \ wait for us and climbs back aboard, signaling for me to do the same.\n\nI climb\
  \ in gingerly, exhausted and thankful to this man who has gone so out of his way\
  \ to help me. Maesh looks back at me from the front seat, nods at me and smiles\
  \ faintly. For the first time in 48 hours, I find myself smiling back."
