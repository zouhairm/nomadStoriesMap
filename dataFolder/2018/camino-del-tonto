Text: "I never liked flashy showbiz - still I found myself in Las Vegas. After 3 days\
  \ in the heat and frightful thunderstorms of Grand Canyon I needed a hotel. I wasn\u2019\
  t really prepared for the 24/7 craziness so I arranged to meet some locals at the\
  \ Liberace Museum.\n\nI found a map and decided to walk. It would be 1 hour on The\
  \ Strip and then 10 min. down a road. I bought a bottle of water and left in time\
  \ to make a stop if something interesting came up - like when in Barcelona I arrived\
  \ to Park Gr\xFCel an hour early and ended up listening to an amazing guitar player.\n\
  \nWalking down The Strip I hadn\u2019t found anything to spend my extra time on,\
  \ so I decided to find the museum and have a look around the area. After 15 min.\
  \ I found myself walking along a fence with a view to the desert and an empty road\
  \ beside me. I was confused. I should be able to see the museum. I speeded up, but\
  \ after another 5 min. everything stayed the same. That\u2019s when I realised my\
  \ mistake. I had trusted a tourist map! The size ratio outside The Strip was wrong\
  \ - I was nowhere near the museum!\n\nWalking in 45\xB0C with no shelter from the\
  \ sun and no water left I felt more in danger than the day before where the tornado\
  \ warning had scared the life out of me in Flagstaff. I was sweating and in severe\
  \ need of water. The only people I\u2019d met were 3 men in a car shouting after\
  \ me and my sweaty, now see-through t-shirt.\n\nThe sun was prickling on my skin,\
  \ the thirst was overwhelming, and I could actually see the heat. It looks the same\
  \ in Thailand when it starts raining heavily and you\u2019re standing in water to\
  \ the knees while people are yelling \u2018watch out for the snakes\u2019 - but\
  \ that\u2019s because of the humidity and there were absolutely no humidity there.\
  \ Luckily I hadn\u2019t been to Thailand yet, so I wasn\u2019t reminded of the water\
  \ masses. I just kept on walking.\n\nI didn\u2019t look at the map. Constantly seeing\
  \ my destination being only a few minutes away didn\u2019t exactly lift my spirits.\
  \ Like when eying the next camp on Kilimanjaro just 30 min. away and you start walking\
  \ faster - and 2 hours later you still see the camp in the same distance. Mountains\
  \ and deserts are treacherous.\n\nIt was there! After 45 min. it was now showing\
  \ on my right hand and on my left there was a gas station. It was 13:00, the agreed\
  \ meeting time and being Danish I live by Scandinavian time where 13:00 means 13:00.\n\
  \n13:08 I was at the museum and oh how I enjoyed the flashy showbiz and all the\
  \ bling-bling costumes while drinking my 1L bottle of water!"
