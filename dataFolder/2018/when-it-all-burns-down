Text: "I never thought that a forest fire would be the thing that would inspire my\
  \ world travels. Travel had long evaded my hungry grasp. Just 6 weeks before the\
  \ fire I had given up on the hopes of a special visit to see one of my oldest and\
  \ dearest friends in Australia when I took a job. It was the same excuse I gave\
  \ the man I started dating one week after the new job started when he asked me if\
  \ I wanted to go to Bali with him.\n\nTwo weeks later on September 12th, I stood\
  \ watching the flames creep from the small valley that cradled my whole life. The\
  \ fire spread across the mountain range as I paced in horror from his vineyard on\
  \ the far end of town. Just hours before I had texted him with shaking hands. I\
  \ evacuated with what salvaged material possessions I could grab in 20 minutes and\
  \ they were strewn about my car. Can I come to you? \n\nIt was several days before\
  \ evacuation orders were lifted and we made it back into town to his home. Now my\
  \ home. There is something that happens when you lose so much. There is a certain\
  \ freedom in the midst of feeling powerless. There is a certain carelessness in\
  \ between the moments of heartbreak over losing so much you cared for. My home with\
  \ most of the possessions that were in it, my job, my school, as well as miles of\
  \ the stunning landscape and the special people that once surrounded my daily life\
  \ were all gone. \n\nPerhaps the shock prevented initial depression maybe it was\
  \ the opportunity to let go. I did let go and with letting go came the desire to\
  \ seize the day. Carpe Diem.\n\nBy January we were on a flight to Indonesia and\
  \ I went on to Australia. That Summer of 2016 he took me to Europe to visit his\
  \ family in the Czech Republic. I went on to Austria to see my favorite painter\
  \ Gustav Klimt at Viena's Belvedere Museum before a two week trip through Italy.\n\
  Martin and I just returned from our fourth big trip. This time exploring the Yucatan\
  \ peninsula from the top to bottom. Last year it was traveling the Ko's in Thailand.\
  \ We are already talking about next year. Vietnam or New Zealand in January and\
  \ Europe in the summer.\n\nI knew everything in my life was going to change the\
  \ day I watched it all burn down. It did in ways I could only have dreamt of. Carpe\
  \ Diem."
