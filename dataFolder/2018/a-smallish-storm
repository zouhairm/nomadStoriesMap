Text: "In less than a week we would be back in the United States. At that moment,\
  \ we were leaving the Mokan island and heading back to the mainland. The plan was\
  \ to return to the peaceful fishing village of Ranong. We were saying our salutations\
  \ to the humble and loving community of Mokens and then the rains came.\n \nIt was\
  \ a \u201Csmallish\u201D storm. We were told it would pass on soon. We would be\
  \ on our way once it blew over. The torrential downpour came in quickly and thoroughly.\
  \ The heavenly pourings left the same way in which they came. After waiting it out,\
  \ we gathered our things and said our second and last goodbyes. The sky, surprisingly,\
  \ cleared up. All that was left were small patches of grey in the distance. Nothing\
  \ too distressing though, but you have to always remember, the ocean can be a fickle\
  \ place. That\u2019s something that we would learn quickly.  A lesson we would never\
  \ forget. We waited out the storm. We had dodged a dicey situation on the waters.\
  \ Now we were back on track for smooth sailing. So we thought... \n\nEver since\
  \ I was a little kid I have always wanted to go to Thailand. My fascination with\
  \ the country, the culture, and the people started in fourth grade. My initial affinity\
  \ for this nation came from a book report I did in Mrs. Lee's class. Thailand was\
  \ the country I chose to share with my classmates. I have fond memories doing a\
  \ show-and-tell project with a picture book of facts to my peers. I can still see\
  \ the book in my mind. It had a picture of a majestic golden temple and the words\
  \ Thailand in shiny lettering. Everything about my fourth grade study on Thai culture\
  \ was riveting to me. And I was convinced that I must visit this enchanted place.\n\
  \nFor six and half weeks I had the greatest opportunity to travel to Southeast Asia\
  \ with a small team of nine. Most of our time was in Thailand but in the middle\
  \ of our trip our team spent ten days in Cambodia. We ran the gambit on experiences\
  \ in both countries. We flew a ton, rode on tuk tuks, participated in medical clinics,\
  \ learned of the horrors of sex trafficking, and partnered with life-empowering\
  \ projects. We learned some of the language, hung out with elephants, ate the best\
  \ food in the world for cheap, and made friends with all types of people. We even\
  \ had a near death experience! It was definitely the last thing I expected. I never\
  \ thought I would be buried in the middle of the Indian Ocean. Nevertheless, if\
  \ you have the time I would like to tell you the rest of the story ...\n \nLike\
  \ I said we..."
