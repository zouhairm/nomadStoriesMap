Text: "The campsite consisted of twelve tents assembled in a half-moon crescent across\
  \ the sands; before them a fire pit gently smoldered, brooding over the nightly\
  \ skies. Within the tents our fellow adventurers slept soundly beneath lavish Boucherouite\
  \ Moroccan rugs, each resting from a long day of camel-back riding to this unknown\
  \ coordinate, somewhere in the Sahara. Everything else sat in opulent darkness apart\
  \ from the shelter that we found ourselves in.\n\nThe shelter was the camp of the\
  \ Berber men that had guided our travels: kindly, they had invited us into their\
  \ dwelling. Though indigenous to North Africa the Berber race has endured a spectrum\
  \ of empires thus through its veins runs a salient fusion of many ancestries - English,\
  \ French and Spanish tongues sang in concert around us as naturally as birdsong\
  \ and, here, all were included regardless of corner or kingdom. Amidst the white,\
  \ organza haze of the Berbers\u2019 burning shisha one man, Aderfi, told us of his\
  \ life working in the desert: of his peace with remoteness, of how he read the weather\
  \ from the dunes, of his insights into the \u2018outside\u2019 world from the hundreds\
  \ of passers-by who perpetually arrived, consumed and then left this desert site.\n\
  \ \nI wondered whether I could live a life of the Berbers with no horizon to call\
  \ my own nor possessions to tie me down, no seven o\u2019clock rise to work nor\
  \ ten o\u2019clock news to feed my Western dismay. I wondered how human needs for\
  \ family, creativity, security might survive amidst this arid landscape and how,\
  \ just maybe, Maslow got it wrong - and these \u2018needs\u2019 are not needs but\
  \ constructs born from an occidental culture. Maybe Aderfi, whose name I would later\
  \ understand to mean \u2018the released\u2019, really did live that life of inner\
  \ peace so sought by so many?\n\nThe next morning as we mounted our camels to leave\
  \ the camp, Aderfi shook my hand and asked me if I really had to leave - could we\
  \ not stay some days longer? His grip was firm and a little too lasting and through\
  \ sad eyes I smiled, the organza haze lifted. Though united by the Sahara stars\
  \ these men of the desert are more alone than they are strong: their biographies,\
  \ so woven with so many cultures, colours, make each as unique as the Boucherouite\
  \ rugs under which we had rested. And though together they roam, in spirit each\
  \ walks alone.\n\u201CI will be back one day\u201D I promised. But for now, songs\
  \ of family, creativity, security were beckoning me home and to the West, from where\
  \ I forever ponder the songs of Adelfi himself."
