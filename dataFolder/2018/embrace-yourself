Text: "\xA1Qu\xE9 lindos ojos qu\xE9 ten\xE9s, nena!\n\nThe embrace is the only gesture\
  \ that a human being does not need to learn. It is natural and instinctive; it is\
  \ the visceral way of communicating with the other and screams the need of showing\
  \ affection and belonging. It is not coincidental that Tango and Argentina have\
  \ embraced each other.\n\nBuenos Aires does not need to be learned, but embraced,\
  \ because only like this it communicates with you. \nAs clich\xE9 as it may sound,\
  \ I permitted myself to get lost on its street. So I walked and walked and walked.\
  \ In the five months spent in Buenos Aires, I recall taking the bus only twice towards\
  \ and returning from La Boca. Over time, I began learning which storm drains are\
  \ shaky and unsafe to step on, which cobbled street is better to avoid, on which\
  \ intersection between San Telmo\u2019s boulevards and its callecitas you have to\
  \ hold your skirt otherwise the air will lift it up (oh, so that is why all women\
  \ wear this short pants under their mini cloch\xE9 dresses, wink) and that is always\
  \ windy in Buenos Aires.\n\nOne day, I noticed this peculiar hall on Corrientes\
  \ Avenue with the Artesan\xEDas Argentinas billboard hanged on its fa\xE7ade. Curious,\
  \ I entered.\n\n\xA1Qu\xE9 lindos ojos qu\xE9 ten\xE9s, nena! \xBFDe donde vienes?\
  \ the 20 something light-brown-curly and messy haired Argentinian flaco asks me\n\
  Rumania\nAh, Rumania, s\xED s\xED me recuerdo la partita de f\xFAtbol del \u2019\
  94 cuando Hagi marc\xF3 un golazo y Argentina se pudri\xF3. \xBFY qu\xE9 haces para\
  \ ac\xE1?\n\u2026\n\xBFAh, tango? \xA1Ven\xED, ven\xED!\n\nJoaquin then takes me\
  \ through the labyrinthine and improvised hall - tenebrous - to cite the legendary\
  \ Borges\u2013 that during weekends functions as a cultural centre with live music,\
  \ performing arts or exhibitions. The hall was the personification of Buenos Aires:\
  \ enigmatic, warm and humid. Finally, we step into this claustrophobic room filled\
  \ with just four Argentinians and their music instruments, who were rehearsing\u2026\
  \ exactly a tango, a Nuevo Tango. They invite me to take part in their ritual and\
  \ for a couple of songs, I just sat there and listened \u2013 that was their way\
  \ of communicating and explaining Buenos Aires to others.\nWe salute with an embrace\
  \ and hope to see each other again at Friday\xB4s concert.\n\nBack on the porte\xF1\
  as streets, it was a sunny November afternoon and right before I entered my house,\
  \ I caught a glimpse of my amber colored eyes\u2019 reflection in the non-stop kiosk\
  \ window, and smiling, I said to myself \xA1Qu\xE9 lindos ojos qu\xE9 ten\xE9s,\
  \ nena!"
