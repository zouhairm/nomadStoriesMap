Text: "\u201CAre you really going to eat that?\u201D I hear my friend say over my\
  \ right shoulder as the old street vendor holds the fried scorpion on a stick in\
  \ front of my face. This is a phrase I\u2019m used to receiving, whether is from\
  \ the fish eye I have just taken from a main course in Colombia, to devouring the\
  \ large clam sashimi that I think I had just pet the day before while diving. \u201C\
  Why not?\u201D I answer, \u201Cclearly there is a market for it here\u201D I say\
  \ as I gesture to the claustrophobic street in Wangfujing. Among my close friends,\
  \ we remind each other that traveling feeds the soul, in my case, I enjoy it the\
  \ most while I am being fed. Trying to find what I am going to eat in China is often\
  \ a guessing game. When I flip through their menus, often that could constitute\
  \ as a long picture book, I find myself playing a game of \u201Cclose your eyes\
  \ and pick a random page\u201D.  The characters are a puzzle of similar shades of\
  \ grey that my mind struggles to put together, even more so when I must decide between\
  \ two pieces of meat and my translation says they are beef and dark beef. When I\
  \ want to have any idea of what I am going to eat before it arrives to my table,\
  \ street markets and the motorcycle food carts can often be a place to start. I\
  \ turned around to face my friend who was looking horrified. Behind her I see a\
  \ Chinese family holding their phones ready to take photos of the English-speaking\
  \ foreigner ready to swallow this arachnid. With my desire to try strange new foods\
  \ I usually expect the response to be disgust, or a turn of the head, not random\
  \ relatives that are not on my family tree ready with their iPhones. Having myself\
  \ be the object of people\u2019s stares caught me off guard when I first landed\
  \ in Asia. Eating every type of food is common in China, however they do not expect\
  \ foreigners to join them in their navigation of their daily food choices. I love\
  \ surprising people around me by being willing to eat anything and everything. It\u2019\
  s amusing when you move to a new country and realize that people are staring at\
  \ you in amazement that you are excited to devour their culture and customs, and\
  \ in my case, especially their food."
