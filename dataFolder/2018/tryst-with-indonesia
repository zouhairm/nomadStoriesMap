Text: "One bright day, fed up of all those rosy tinted stories my gym buddies make\
  \ of travelling abroad to all those fairy tale destinations, I decided a story is\
  \ long overdue. So, when my gym instructor told me of a plan for a trek in Java\
  \ - Mount Bromo and all, I jumped at it like a kid jumping at the sight of candy.\n\
  As the day dawned, I took a flight and it was from then on, it was a flight of imagination\
  \ as group travel can be.\nThe headlines of the trip get created at the embarkation\
  \ point which is where the new destination begins to make itself known.\nThe flight\
  \ to Kuala Lumpur had a different type of people than the flight to Surabaya. As\
  \ the flight was about to land me and a few foreigners were being handed over passports\
  \ and customs forms for our Surabayan co-passengers.\nAt Surabaya we met a cheerful\
  \ man Agus Kurniawan who was to be our guide for much of the trip. \nThe small towns\
  \ of Java island resembled my home town Ernakulam in Cochin city, India with the\
  \ difference that the people looked different.\nHot and humid all the way.Couldn\u2019\
  t wait to catch a glimpse of a real volcano.\nThe day after we arrived we went off\
  \ on a trek to Semeru.\nAs we started the trek, we were greeted by Javanese teenagers\
  \ greeting us with 'Semangat !!' (or Spirit that we did need in abundant measure)\
  \ .\nAfter a bit of the trek it started raining unexpectedly. Lords of the volcano\
  \ - do not turn off the burner yet!\nIt slowed down the trek and made it tougher\
  \ - a 2 hours trek drenched and soaked took us 5 hours in retrospect.\nSomeway up\
  \ the mountain, as I clambered up a rain shed I met some Javanese youngsters who\
  \ were probably seeing for the first time, a funny looking foreigner of unexplained\
  \ nationality and a weird comical handle bar moustache that even comedians and villains\
  \ are loath to use. \nChatted up with them and took instant liking for two people\
  \ - Agung and Dian. I followed them as we clambered up the hill towards the base\
  \ camp.\nWith the ground slippery, it was as tough as it could be.\nWe stayed at\
  \ a dormitory shed used by porters and waited it out and shared food. This is where\
  \ I met again the rest of the people I came with for the trek. We shared and exchanged\
  \ food had some banter till we could move again.\nAfter a few hours, we went on\
  \ to the base camp by when it was almost late evening , set up camps and retired\
  \ for the night.\nThe next day it was time for us to return home and take leave\
  \ of the amazing friends I made and with whom I am still in touch.\nVive La Indonesia."
