Text: "As the afternoon sun beat down on our pink shoulders, my brother and I stepped\
  \ off the rickety fishing boat. Our barefoot host yelled out in greeting, relieved\
  \ we had made it to Gulhi after the local ferry had been canceled indefinitely.\
  \ Jas gestured for us to put our bags in his wheelbarrow and we trailed behind him,\
  \ dodging squealing children kicking a tattered ball.  \n\nAfter months of frenzied\
  \ travel in Southeast Asia, two weeks in the Maldives sounded relaxing. With visions\
  \ of white beaches, cabanas, and cold drinks, I had convinced my younger brother\
  \ to meet me. \n\nJas gave us a tour. Walking down sandy lanes of cracked, pastel-colored\
  \ homes, we saw the new school, old mosque, only restaurant, and no other tourists.\
  \ I felt a pang of guilt in my stomach. My brother had used all of his vacation\
  \ days and I had brought him somewhere with no foreigners, no alcohol, and not much\
  \ to do. \n\nFor two weeks, we became keen observers of life on this sleepy speck\
  \ in the Indian Ocean. \n\nEvery morning over coffee, we watched the men float off\
  \ in search of tuna and the women, perpetually donned in long black abaya, wave\
  \ children to school. \n\nWe spent the afternoons at the Bikini Beach, netted off\
  \ from view to preserve the morals of the local community, swimming, sleeping, and\
  \ taking blurry photos of the fish that congregated near the shore. \n\nIn the evenings,\
  \ we would sit on the fallen palm at the northern tip of the island and watch the\
  \ sun sink down into the sea. Then, it was on to the caf\xE9 where the men gathered\
  \ to smoke, eat betel leaf, and watch the European League on an old TV. \n\nOnce\
  \ the streetlights flickered on, we strolled the laneways in the moonlight, pausing\
  \ to speak with curious old women seated on netted benches outside their homes.\n\
  \nAt first, we felt sorry for these people. We wondered if they enjoyed the monotony\
  \ of their lives or if they simply didn\u2019t know any different. We pitied them\
  \ for the opportunities they didn\u2019t have because their world was so small.\n\
  \nSoon though, we came to realize that even though they lacked excitement, they\
  \ were genuinely happy. Not having much to do meant that they invested a lot in\
  \ each other. Although there were many things they didn\u2019t have, they had what\
  \ they needed.\n\nAs we prepared to rejoin the world, I realized that this was the\
  \ longest my brother and I had spent together in years. Through the peaceful monotony\
  \ we had got to know each other again. We had come for the beach, but what we got\
  \ was so much more."
