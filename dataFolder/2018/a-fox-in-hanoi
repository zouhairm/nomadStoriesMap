Text: "The current picked us up on the steps of our hotel.  First floor cafes were\
  \ filled with locals and backpackers alike.  Knock off North Face backpacks hung\
  \ in open store fronts, shopkeepers greeted passerbys as they held up elephant pants\
  \ for sale, the wardrobe of choice for tourists.  Streets curved back on themselves\
  \ and I tried to create a mental map by remembering leaning telephone poles with\
  \ overloaded boxes.  \nHanoi was our second stop in Vietnam and we had set out for\
  \ something to eat, hopeful to find the perfect bowl of Pho.  Our trek had taken\
  \ us across countless narrow streets where navigating the constant line of moped\
  \ traffic first felt like a hopeless game of Frogger.  Observing the locals, it\u2019\
  s best to just go for it.  The vehicular traffic of Hanoi feels no sense of entitlement\
  \ and those on foot navigate the streets unimpeded.  Still there is a flickering\
  \ sense of pride after our first crossing.\nMy mental map had quickly proven untrustworthy\
  \ as the tired telephone poles proved the rule rather than the exception.  The current\
  \ had taken us near a park.  We could make out a small temple situated on an island\
  \ at the center of a small lake.  There would likely be some dining options in the\
  \ area.  Our next opportunity to cross was approaching when a woman seated on the\
  \ sidewalk placed a small dumpling into my wife\u2019s hand.  She politely returned\
  \ the dumpling and the woman smiled understandingly as we continued on our way.\
  \  I took another step in cadence with the current and for the first time felt the\
  \ roughness of Hanoi\u2019s sidewalk with my barefoot.\nI spun around to find a\
  \ crazy haired man working feverishly on my sandal.  I reached for it, but he had\
  \ undoubtedly been working this hustle for too long to lose this quickly.  He jammed\
  \ a long needle through the bottom, a needle that made you think twice about moving\
  \ too quickly and not out of place repairing a parachute (not that this was the\
  \ man you\u2019d want doing your parachute repairs).  He pulled out a tube of something\
  \ clear and spurted it on the sandal.  At this point I grabbed it back from him,\
  \ he demanded payment.  He knew a few English words and he threw two at us as we\
  \ walked away.  After a few steps we noticed a backpacker that was smirking at us\
  \ from a stoop.  I shot him a look that said \u201CWe could have used some help.\u201D\
  \  He laughed and returned the look with one that said \u201CIt\u2019s all part\
  \ of it.\u201D  \n\nOur initiation, we were part of Hanoi, at home with the saints\
  \ and the scoundrels alike."
