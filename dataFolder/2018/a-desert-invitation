Text: "A desert invitation\n\n\u201CI hate sand though! I probably won\u2019t be able\
  \ to open my eyes for most of the time. It\u2019ll be a waste, really,\u201D I mutter\
  \ to a man I\u2019ve known for just a moment as he extends an invitation.\n\n A\
  \ few hours after crossing the border from South Africa to Namibia and 2 calls,\
  \ I\u2019m loading my suitcase into the Jeep of a woman called Sukie, at the foot\
  \ of the largest dune in the world, Dune 7, delaying my arrival in Swakopmund. Certain\
  \ that I would regret my decision in about 30 minutes, I let out a \u201Cwhat the\
  \ heck\u201D  sigh and convince myself that I should actually be proud for living\
  \ on the edge a bit. After all, I just took a bus from Cape Town to Namibia\u2026\
  \ I could have flown there in less than half of the time. I\u2019ve also just accepted\
  \ an invitation to a party involving an insane amount of sand, from someone named\
  \ Mortimer.\n\nNot one for dry regions, I decided on Swakopmund as a base. I\u2019\
  m a seaside girl, after all and longed to explore the country\u2019s gem stone beaches\
  \ along the Skeleton Coast. Somehow this half-German man has persuaded me to join\
  \ his family and friends for a party at the foot of this 383m dune. \nOur conversation\
  \ started around drones, of all things. He has a collection and a penchant for capturing\
  \ majestic landscapes. He\u2019s also passionate about the people of the soil and\
  \ explained that the country\u2019s prominent ethnic group, the Ovambo, constituted\
  \ about half the population. Then there are the Kavango, Herero, Damara and Caprivian,\
  \ amongst others. He\u2019d just finished a series of photoshoots around South Africa.\
  \ His van\u2019s engine packed up on his way back.\n\nWith a tent set up at the\
  \ base of the dune, people were enjoying some German beer, while someone was preparing\
  \ dough for pot bread. Suki again made an appearance, along with a few other women\
  \ and introduced me to some Namibian cuisine which ranged from Swakopmund asparagus\
  \ to Kalahari truffles, Kapana - beef cooked on an open flame, popular with local\
  \ vendors, and Luderitz Crayfish. How was I supposed to eat all of this and then\
  \ climb a dune?\n\nAfter a rather extravagant lunch, we made our way to the dune\
  \ at just the right time, taking it from the side, as recommended by our dune experts.\
  \ The other side of the dune presented another dimension, with people on bikes,\
  \ SUVs and even sand boards claiming the dessert as their playground. A whole new\
  \ world of adventure had opened and I was excited for what else this south west\
  \ African nation had to offer me, thanks to Mortimer\u2019s invitation."
