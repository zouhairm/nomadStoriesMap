Text: "This is a true story. The train whistled and chugged on through the Siberian\
  \ forest, snapping me out of my gentle hypnosis as I watched the trees roll by.\
  \ In the distance was the murmur of the restaurant car and I wondered if I\u2019\
  d see him again this evening. \n\nThe engine puffed to a halt. We\u2019d reached\
  \ a station. I watched the American scramble off the train towards an old, Russian\
  \ woman, selling smoked fish. He was haggling - risky at the smaller stations. The\
  \ train, in all its national glory painted in red, blue and white, would leave abruptly\
  \ and the next one was 2 days away. The American returned. The train whistled and\
  \ we were off, streaming through the silver birch trees. My mind blurred once again.\
  \ \n\nThe restaurant car was full. After eating I went for a stroll, enjoying the\
  \ rare emptiness of the carriages. The hum of voices disappeared as I found myself\
  \ in the smoking car with just the chug of the engine in the background. He was\
  \ there too. I smiled and rolled a cigarette. He leant towards me and lit it. I\
  \ asked him his name and received a strongly accented response. Our words were disjointed\
  \ and I relied on his eyes. Vladimir. I exhaled and stubbed out my cigarette and\
  \ the train whistled. He wished me what I can only imagine was good night.\n\nWe\u2019\
  d come to a clearing and I was transfixed by a bird fluttering. The train rocked\
  \ but I didn\u2019t move. He walked towards me and smiled, saying something I didn\u2019\
  t understand. I smiled, piecing together his words. Vladimir was off to Vladivostok.\
  \ I looked outside to the carpet of silver birches. We knew we were changing tracks,\
  \ nearing lake Baikal where I would get on the Trans-Mongolian. The train whistled.\n\
  \nOur encounter was interrupted by a uniformed Russian attendant yelling at a young\
  \ Chinese man. I looked at him. He was staring at the ground sheepishly - drunk.\
  \ I caught Vladimir\u2019s eye and giggled nervously. He\u2019d been listening to\
  \ the woman\u2019s words but didn\u2019t explain them to me. The train whistled\
  \ and he walked away, looking back briefly, our eyes locked once more.\n\nThe view\
  \ from the window had changed; the vast Siberian silver birch trees had become the\
  \ Gobi desert. At every station, I was greeted with new faces. Russian workers were\
  \ replaced by more asiatic looking people travelling to visit their families. We\
  \ were fast approaching Beijing and I savoured my last hours of tranquillity. I\
  \ understood why people called this the greatest train journey in the world. The\
  \ Trans-Mongolian whistled and chugged on."
