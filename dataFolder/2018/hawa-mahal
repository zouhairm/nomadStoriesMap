Text: "Seedhe!\n\nFrom our accommodation, my friend calls on an auto-rickshaw driver\
  \ to take us straight to Jaipur\u2019s Old City, a walled complex of palaces, temples,\
  \ market places, and slum. The driver, Mohammad, who introduces himself as our \u201C\
  pilot\u201D for the day, is taking us to the Hawa Mahal, a five-storey pink-sandstone\
  \ palace, the most iconic landmark of the city. Similar sights mark its streets,\
  \ the same kind of pandemonium that we\u2019ve seen in the other cities. But despite\
  \ the hubbub of being at the center of an urban cosmopolis, the Hawa Mahal evokes\
  \ a kind of strangeness, something simultaneously exotic and ethereal. The palace\
  \ prides itself of its ornately decorated facade, which was constructed towards\
  \ the end of the eighteenth century in the form of the crown of Krishna. With about\
  \ a thousand tiny latticed windows, called jharokas, jutting out from the wall,\
  \ it was once a haven for the ladies of the royal household, from which they could\
  \ peek into the world outside of the palace without having to reveal themselves\
  \ to the public. The interior of the palace is rather simple, a central courtyard\u2014\
  less-ornate, painted in yellow-gold\u2014where visitors are left to their quiet\
  \ musings, away from the sweltering heat and chaos outside. \n\nInside the palace,\
  \ however, could feel like a maze, with its corridors and stairs and ramps running\
  \ like entrails, low and narrow, so that sometimes people could only go through\
  \ one at a time as they\u2019re all led to the top of the front wall. As I walk\
  \ my way up, I imagine what it was like back then, on its glorious days, when women\
  \ in their colourful sarees used to wander around this great hall, looking out through\
  \ these windows, gossiping, giggling, in the voyeuristic thrill of watching the\
  \ world outside. I imagine those women through my friend, whom I take photographs\
  \ of\u2014I tell him to look away from the camera, to gaze out one of the windows,\
  \ so that his photos would look more candid than touristy. Between takes or when\
  \ he looks for another spot, I touch one side of the pink wall, feeling the kind\
  \ of roughness to it, one that is only true to the time past."
