Text: "I am ransacking my brain to think what I should write, I have so many stories,\
  \ and out of those so many, again, so many are my favourites. However, what comes\
  \ to my mind, is a journey that I started last year. The journey that is still going\
  \ and has now become part of me and is so dear. The journey of exploration. Not\
  \ just of the places, but also about myself. Sounds cliched, the journey to find\
  \ the self. But, after being in this world for about 30 years (sigh), and experiencing\
  \ variety of diverse things, it is slightly difficult to find non-cliched things.\
  \ I love to travel, to any place possible. Which is why I love my job as well. But,\
  \ travel alone, being a female! This scared me. Even my inner feminism would not\
  \ have questioned this thought. But historically speaking, personalities tend to\
  \ change with time, and, it did with me as well, but suddenly. \n\nI ventured out\
  \ to new places alone to explore them, and everything that those places has to offer.\
  \ Thus, began the least-likely-to-happen journey to fill my rucksack with as many\
  \ memories as possible. \n\nThe exploration started with Bir, a small town in the\
  \ state of Himachal Pradesh. As I did paragliding there, I was full of fear, how\
  \ could I not be scared, I was jumping off a cliff. Voluntarily. I could sense each\
  \ heartbeat clearly and was shaking as I saw other people taking the jump off the\
  \ cliff. I cannot do that. I just cannot. Just because I got divorced, does not\
  \ mean I do THIS. Alok, my instructor\u2019s voice brought me back to the cliff.\n\
  \n\u201CMadam this is safe and will be fun.\u201D I let him put harness around me,\
  \ only because I was too numb to react. What if I die, what if the parachute did\
  \ not open, what if I fall. I do not want to die like this, this is an embarrassing\
  \ way to die. I cannot even say this out loud, because, apparently strong independent\
  \ woman who can travel alone can definitely jump off the cliff. She is empowered.\
  \ Well, I am not. \n\nAfter 6 insane people jumped off the cliff, it was my turn.\
  \ I could not win against the army of instructors who were planning to make me jump.\
  \ As I stood at the edge of the cliff, I was told to run, and I did, run and took\
  \ the leap. The biggest leap ever, I was screaming, but nobody could hear. Only\
  \ my heart could. I was suddenly in the air, my feet dangling freely. Pure joy filled\
  \ my heart and euphoria replaced the fear. I knew I had to come down but at least\
  \ I had wings for a moment, and this I will never forget. It was thrilling, and\
  \ I cried in excitement."
