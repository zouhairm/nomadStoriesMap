Text: "I stand, biting my tongue. My groin, tightly pressed against a stranger\u2019\
  s. \n\nA religious man, with thin grey hair, preaches in Spanish. He removes his\
  \ glasses; tiny compared to his chubby face, and looks through each of us as he\
  \ rambles.\n\nPeppa Pig is my only salvation, staring out from the side of a child\u2019\
  s faded rucksack. I momentarily escape with the character, seeing my niece play\
  \ with her toys at home.\n\nAlthough necessary for leaving the village, to wade\
  \ through the river without lasting consequence, I learn that flip flops are not\
  \ suitable for bus travel in Nicaragua. When people squeeze past, they clip you.\
  \ There\u2019s no resentment. There can\u2019t be. Pressing your crotch against\
  \ those sat in front of you is the norm also. As is feeling the warmth of somebody\u2019\
  s body pulsating against you.\n\nMy friend, Mixis positions herself at the very\
  \ front; she\u2019s local and knows how to play public transport. She rides the\
  \ wagon like a magic carpet, her face pressed forward, her smile beaming through\
  \ the window to all that we pass.\n\nAfter two hours, we stop for a break, parking\
  \ behind well-behaved cows on a lorry. The main eatery, an open hut, welcomes us.\
  \ A man with water droplets rolling down the dry hard skin of his face, openly chops\
  \ a carcass. He hangs pieces on a line, ready for his smiling female assistant.\
  \ A stew with rice is the menu. I order Fanta.\n\nBack on the C62, rusty luggage\
  \ racks hang low. Bags, plants and, in my case as the only foreigner on board, curious\
  \ eyes surround. Over the shoulder of the Lord\u2019s self-proclaimed gospel, I\
  \ glimpse Mixis\u2019s teeth stretching wide. I nod to acknowledge that I\u2019\
  m OK. \n\nThe preacher raises his voice. I raise the volume on my IPod.\n\nFood\
  \ sellers break things up. Balancing buckets on their heads, they wriggle through\
  \ the tired vehicle. If I were a guy hanging out the door, I\u2019d step off & walk.\
  \ If I were a kid clinging to the rear ladder, I\u2019d jump off with friends and\
  \ see who could last the longest before needing to climb back on. It would be a\
  \ risky game, one I would\u2019ve loved as a child.\n\nFire flies flicker in the\
  \ distance. As we drift deeper up the mountain, the roads turn into dirt tracks\
  \ and the lamp posts into stars.\n\nA chicken joins the party, gripped by the hands\
  \ of a weathered lady; her face overpowered by wrinkles.\n\nThe chicken is well\
  \ behaved. It\u2019s a refreshing change. \n\nUnlike every other soul on board,\
  \ she doesn\u2019t stare at me.\n\nI smile to myself.\n\nI swear the chicken smiles\
  \ too."
