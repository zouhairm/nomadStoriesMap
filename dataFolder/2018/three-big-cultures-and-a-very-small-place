Text: "It was 12 o'clock in the day and the strong sun was already affecting us. 4\
  \ young people who unwittingly were the center of attention in Maicao, a small town\
  \ in La Guajira in Colombia.\n\nA class work had led us to decide to make a documentary\
  \ about 3 cultures in the same town, I thought it was an excellent idea but like\
  \ all the places in the world where there are several cultures in one place, \xBF\
  what would be special about this place?, I did not know yet.\n\nWe were looking\
  \ for 3 girls of 15 years who will tell us from their experience as was their culture\
  \ in different subjects, but when you get to Maicao the last thing you would expect\
  \ would be that the 3 cultures would be so strongly marked. The arijuna girl, that\
  \ is to say the native of that place without any influence of immigrants, lived\
  \ in a neighborhood only of arijuna people, went to schools where there were only\
  \ young people of her culture and although she saw in the central square the girls\
  \ of the other cultures they never had contact. \n\n\nThe other two girls were a\
  \ Muslim who decided from a young age that she wanted to wear the hijab, and the\
  \ other belonging to the indigenous Wayuu tribe, she wore with her \"blanket\" and\
  \ \u201Cmochila\u201D  that the people of her tribe took as a way to preserve their\
  \ tradition and subsistence.\n\nI couldn't  believe that such a small place would\
  \ have 3 so different cultures, each had its own space, schools, restaurants for\
  \ their traditional, churches, mosques and sacred meetings, apparently everyone\
  \ has everything so definite that there is no time of union and sharing among them,\
  \ only in the town square where all cultures look each other and comment but never\
  \ to join more than usual, and not even they know the reason why.\n\nIn Maicao 3\
  \ girls of 15 years old, taught me things of their cultures that I would not learn\
  \ in books, they showed me that only traveling would know such a curious place where\
  \ in few streets there are three very marked cultures, breaking with stereotypes\
  \ of each one that can only be break traveling to that place.\n\nArijuna taught\
  \ me that despite living in a small place and never having left, she feels a beauty\
  \ queen, a Wayuu indigenous of 15 who dreams of becoming tribal chief and helping\
  \ her community more, and a Muslim with a hijab that it doesn\u2019t allow us to\
  \ know beyond his face, he taught us that the Muslim religion is not war but a religion\
  \ of love."
