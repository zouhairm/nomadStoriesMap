Text: "In a sunny morning of late September, Miriam, Irene, Dario and I leave Antananarivo.\
  \ I\u2019m happy to abandon the chaotic capital to drove towards the part of the\
  \ path I\u2019m waiting the most: the Tsingy de Bemaraha. Hundreds of kilometers\
  \ of partially paved roads and more stops than I was hoping are waiting for us ,\
  \ but I\u2019m equally enthusiast. I\u2019m planning this trip for months, I\u2019\
  m reading guides, reports, articles; I\u2019ve the presumption to be able to imagine\
  \ everything that can happen to us. From Milano, crossing the upland didn\u2019\
  t seem so long. To reach Morondava, point of departure of all the adventures in\
  \ the Tsingy, one day of travel isn\u2019t enough. Our halfway stop will be Miandrivazo,\
  \ distant a little less than 400 km from Antananarivo. The altitude is high, around\
  \ 1500 meters above see level, but the heat is equally scorching. There are no clouds\
  \ in the sky and our Terracan seems a furnace. We proceed without almost stopping.\
  \ The landscape around us is uniform while the people change imperceptibly, like\
  \ a litmus test. As we leave the more crowded towns we find ourselves on forgotten\
  \ roads and in villages that remind me the outposts in the Far West. The only permanent\
  \ feature of this long day that never change is the red dust. The red dust that\
  \ covers everything, every animal, every person. Us as well, who dart fast in a\
  \ otherwise still landscape. Slowly it lays down on our words and on our minds.\
  \ The car fall in a thoughtful silence. The inhabitants look at us, bored, sit on\
  \ the brinks of the road , everyone focused in a personal idleness. The only thing\
  \ remined for us to do is to watch the world outside our vehicle. We observe broken\
  \ houses, arid fields and resigned faces. People looks like statues of clay at the\
  \ edges of a dusty road. Every town is the same and we are fleeting viewers of motionless\
  \ living cribs. Grows up in me the feeling of inappropriateness, the idea of coming\
  \ from another world. I observe the appeasement for an already written future. On\
  \ this infinite upland the only persons who carry on moving are the children, unawares\
  \ of the disparity of the world. Those kids who walk for kilometers to reach the\
  \ school. Those kids who look for something special in identical days. Although\
  \ the red dust looms over the houses and the possibilities. Although the red dust\
  \ falls down on all of us, without leaving a glimmer."
