Text: "Stepping off the train onto the platform, I glanced at my best friend and gave\
  \ her a ridiculous grin. After having petit d\xE9jeuner in Paris, taking the Chunnel\
  \ to England, and then a long train ride up to Scotland, mostly consisting of us\
  \ riding backward in the dark, we had finally arrived in Edinburgh, Scotland. A\
  \ city in a country that we had no intention of visiting, mostly because we decided\
  \ we wouldn't understand their accent. Yet, when we had an extra day in our trip\
  \ that we were finally taking, a dream that had been planned over many a night in\
  \ our tiny dorm room Freshmen year of college, we decided, why not? Why not, indeed.\
  \ The first thing to happen upon our arrival occurred when we were going up to street\
  \ level. A guy in a kilt grabbed the bottom of my suitcase and said, \"up we go\
  \ lassie!\" and we ran together up the three mini-flights of escalators. This ended\
  \ with him leaving abruptly with his friends to find a pub, and with me staring\
  \ after him, starry-eyed, in shock, and a bit in love. My friend and I looked at\
  \ each other and burst out laughing because we had never seen so many men in kilts\
  \ that weren't on TV. Next, we ended up going the wrong way to our hotel. I am bad\
  \ with geography and in my limited knowledge, forgot that Scotland was part of the\
  \ United Kingdom. So, using a downloaded map instead of the data plan I most definitely\
  \ could have been using, we walked three miles in the wrong direction before my\
  \ friend corrected us and we started back. Then, just after we passed the train\
  \ station we had come out of twenty minutes before, it started to rain. Literally,\
  \ as soon as we passed the entrance, there was a torrential downpour. I'm talking\
  \ sheets of pelting rain smacking us from all directions as the wind blew our hair\
  \ up and sideways, so we couldn't see the cobblestone street in front of us. Looking\
  \ at each other incredulously, we started giggling and running. Making our way through\
  \ what felt like a mild hurricane, we finally made it to our lovely hotel, drenched\
  \ and surprisingly happy. We ended our incredibly prolonged day with Earl Grey tea\
  \ and milk, my first and best cup to date, and a packet of biscuits the hotel left\
  \ for us in our room. The next day was filled with extensive shopping, amusement\
  \ in the Camera Obscura, and the best fish and chips I've ever had. We ended up\
  \ wishing we had spent more time in Edinburgh since we had so much fun, despite\
  \ pronouncing it wrong the entire time. Looks like we were right about the accent."
