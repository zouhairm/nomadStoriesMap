Text: "The street is buzzing around me, noisy with the strums of guitars, the beating\
  \ of drums and seductive voices singing in Spanish. Chatter and laughter harmonise\
  \ the sounds and together, it feels like I'm in a musical. My fingers are intertwined\
  \ in his he watches as my eyes sparkle, darting around to absorb the town around\
  \ us. Though it\u2019s evening, we see all the colours of the rainbow scattered\
  \ in archways, doors and windows. My ears perk up to the soft strums of guitar strings\
  \ at a bar some way and I am lured there almost without control.\n\nWe stand with\
  \ our feet just over the edge into the bar. Everyone is sitting shoulder to shoulder\
  \ and in the space that only sits about 20 people, there is little hope to get us\
  \ seated. A couple wave us over and ask us to sit down. The music fades in the background\
  \ and I don't even remember what he sang, only that it was beautiful. Instead, I\
  \ am focused on them - a glamorous looking older couple (old enough to my parents)\
  \ who make every effort to ensure we love their country. \"Si, me encanta Colombia\
  \ mucho mucho!\" I reassure them. I love this country. We exchange phone numbers\
  \ and they tell us that they will pick us up the next day for lunch. \n\nIn a time\
  \ where it is natural to feel sceptical and doubt people's motives, I want to embrace\
  \ kindness and generosity. Sure enough, we wait on the side of the road the following\
  \ day and they pick us up. We spend the day together, being personally chauffeured\
  \ around the colourful and vibrant towns in the area. They buy us lunch, then coffee\
  \ then souvenirs. You know when things seem too good to be true so you wait for\
  \ that moment the end abruptly by some completely unexpected event? I wanted. It\
  \ didn't happen. She is a tall, voluptuous woman with dark hair that waves down\
  \ her back. He is stocky, standing tall and confident. They're nothing like my parents\
  \ at all and yet, after a day with these strangers, they feel completely familiar.\
  \ I am at home like the prodigal daughter that had lost her way but had returned.\
  \ \n\nIs it possible that these strangers could feel like parents just after a day?\
  \ This isn't the Colombia that I knew and read about. This wasn't an interaction\
  \ that involved drugs or crime. This was just humans treating other humans will\
  \ love, kindness and generosity. And it is because of this couple, Cesar and Liliana,\
  \ that my heart never left Colombia."
