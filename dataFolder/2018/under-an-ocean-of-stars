Text: "Humans thrive on curiosity. Without it, we\u2019d all still be sat in caves\
  \ rubbing two sticks together. We experiment in order to move forward. We design,\
  \ we devise, we create, we do. The hunger for discovery is a fundamental attribute\
  \ to our species -  and that is why we love to travel. When I was on board our sea\
  \ vessel, coasting the Whitsundays in Australia, I spoke to our ships deck hand\
  \ for a few hours as it drifted into night and after delving into each others back\
  \ stories we discovered that we had a mutual fascination; the stars. As the sun\
  \ set we began discussing ancient astronomy and he was able to educate me on Australia's\
  \ night skies, pointing out well known constellations and their astrological stories\
  \ - a topic I was completely enthralled by.\n\nWe kept in touch since, but it wasn't\
  \ until a few weeks ago that he told me that a phrase I had said during our trip\
  \ will stick with him for the rest of his life. We were stood on the back of the\
  \ boat, now in the pitch black, wrapped up in jumpers and away from the rest of\
  \ the party, leaning over the railings and gazing up at the night sky. It was a\
  \ complete abyss of stars - stars in their unmeasurable thousands; untraceable and\
  \ phenomenal. I had only seen a sky like this once before in my life (in Malapascua)\
  \ and I turned to this guy - whom had been a stranger but a few hours previous -\
  \ and said \u201CThis, right here, is the closest thing we humans have to magic.\u201D\
  \ And he claims that that moment changed something in his mind, about how he wanted\
  \ to perceive this life. \n\nIt may sound a little Hollywood scripted, but I said\
  \ it with such conviction that we both stood there in silence, still looking up\
  \ but nodding in agreement, with tears in our eyes. Yes ok, we\u2019d had a few\
  \ wines, but the point is, is that in that moment that I had shared with someone\
  \ I barely knew, I had felt an overwhelming bond to him, to my surroundings, to\
  \ the universe. It really was, nothing less than magic. \n\nWould I have felt that\
  \ sat in my bedroom watching Netflix? Would I have felt that walking to another\
  \ long shift at work with my headphones in and kicking the upturned pebbles? Would\
  \ I have felt that, Sunday morning when I was heading to the pub for a classic hangover\
  \ breakfast? Probably not. And now, I have not only a local connection through this\
  \ wonderful friend of mine, but a connection built on the foundations of fascination\
  \ with this inexplicable and beguiling universe. Go grab your passport; the world\
  \ is waiting to be discovered."
