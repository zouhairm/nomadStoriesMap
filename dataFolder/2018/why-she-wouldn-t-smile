Text: "I met her in her little rural home in India. It was one room with no carpet\
  \ on the concrete floor, no running water, and no electricity. The only dishware\
  \ I saw was one pot over a fire pit in the corner. The woman held a baby and looked\
  \ at us with stony eyes. She was beautiful, with long dark hair and colorful clothes.\
  \ But she didn\u2019t seem to like us.\nThe little village in rural India was hidden\
  \ on a road shared by everyone, including cars, farmers, and cattle. We arrived\
  \ in a small tour group of about ten people, as India isn\u2019t safe to travel\
  \ to alone unless you know the area and you\u2019re a male.\nWhen we first got to\
  \ the village, the only thing I could think about was how I needed to pee. The men\
  \ in our group found a common bush to hide behind and do their business. The rest\
  \ of us women just held it when we quickly realized that there are no restrooms.\n\
  The men welcomed us to their village while the women stayed by their houses. The\
  \ older women were friendly to us too. Most of those women were widowers. It was\
  \ the younger women that just seemed to silently despise us.\nIncluding the one\
  \ that let us into her home.\nAfter welcoming ceremonies and taking pictures with\
  \ us, our guide recommended giving money to the village as thanks. He quietly told\
  \ us women to give money to the women, because the men in this village run the household.\
  \ The men will keep the money and spend it on alcohol and drugs, but the women will\
  \ be beaten if the men catch them keeping money from them.\nAnd I began to understand\
  \ why that young woman earlier wouldn\u2019t smile. \nIndia is an amazing country\
  \ that is known as the former British Empire\u2019s \u201CJewel in the Crown\u201D\
  . It has very rich resources and tremendous potential. India was the British Empire\u2019\
  s most valuable colony for a reason. A country that has the capability to build\
  \ the Taj Mahal has the capability to do amazing things.\nBut no one would know\
  \ that by looking at a little village like that one.\nThe entire village wasn\u2019\
  t bigger than a block in New York City. The women are probably married off before\
  \ puberty, or just after. Social media trends like #metoo and #timesup won\u2019\
  t reach these villages with no electricity and no smartphones. And even if these\
  \ women had money, most of them didn\u2019t go to school. They couldn\u2019t read\
  \ or leave the village on their own.\nI wouldn\u2019t smile either.\nAnd I would\
  \ despise us too.\nI don\u2019t even know that young woman\u2019s name."
