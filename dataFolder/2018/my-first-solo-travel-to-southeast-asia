Text: "Whether it was night trains, delayed flights, pub streets or the temple of\
  \ faces, the most memorable was the solace that sneaked in while all alone. The\
  \ feelings are intensified while all by yourself in a new country. I read somewhere\
  \ that every woman should travel alone (at least) once in our lives. While flying\
  \ all alone to Cambodia, it was a relief to see many female tourists onboard. While\
  \ processing my visa at the Siem Reap Airport, the immigration officers seemed clueless\
  \ about my country. One of them said he had never heard of Bhutan until that day\
  \ I showed up. Two Taiwanese students, queued right behind me, asked if Bhutan was\
  \ the richest country in the world as told by their history teacher. When you travel,\
  \ you hear all such exotic ideas about your own country. Kaka, the tuktuk driver,\
  \ who resembled Jackie Chan and spoke fair English, came to pick me up. My hotel\
  \ was grand and peaceful with large garden and a swimming pool with a bar. Some\
  \ jazz music playing in the bar-- but it was empty almost all the time. My room\
  \ was very spacious with antique furniture and a walk-in closet. All evening I sat\
  \ in my balcony, sipping my coffee, reading a book, listening to the music from\
  \ the deserted bar. At last, I felt at peace with my solitude. I fell asleep listening\
  \ to the lulling sound of the rain, insects and the occasional croaking sound of\
  \ toads. I woke up in the middle of the night. There was perfect stillness. I tried\
  \ to get back to sleep but in vain. The walk-in closet looked no more fancy to me.\
  \ I opened it and three big mosquitoes escaped out. \u201CHello there! I have some\
  \ company\u201D. I slept peacefully. With its ruins and hunting beauty, Angkor Wat\
  \ complex is a famous ancient temple site in Cambodia. I instantly fell in love\
  \ with the desolate ruins of Angkor Wat. After over a week\u2019s stay in Cambodia,\
  \ I realized that traveling solo does give you a sense of confidence and independence.\
  \ Finally, I landed in Bangkok. A stranger approached me asking if I was looking\
  \ for a cab. I followed him. When we reached the ground floor, I was alarmed as\
  \ there was no sign of any taxi. That very moment, I released I had trusted the\
  \ wrong guy. Luckily, the elevator door opened and the crook vanished. I had a narrow\
  \ escape. Ironically, of all the places in the world, I had to encounter a crook\
  \ in the country I have traveled frequently. This was a semi-tragic ending to my\
  \ exotic solo trip. Still, I have learned that no place is safe or dangerous, as\
  \ long as you are careful."
