Text: Sitting on a morning train going to an unspecified place with my free-spirited
  friend and travel partner little did I know what would soon follow. No room booking
  made prior to setting off on an adventure was new to me but I wanted to give it
  a try. After the first night's nerves and reservations subsided, due to a dodgy
  hotel, we emerged into the day feeling ready. Soon we were met by a friendly family
  on the opposite corner who was selling betelnut chewable tobacco. I was at first
  wary and distant yet my friend's warm exchanges with the ladies selling and the
  ensuing smiles put me at ease to join in and to even try some of their homemade
  soup. Soon we were offered a ride to the local glass bead factory and to top it
  all off invited for dinner to their house later on. The moment I sat around their
  table surrounded by the female members of a Taiwanese family being offered warmth,
  hospitality and openness I marveled at the beauty of life. Despite our limited verbal
  communication, due to a language barrier, we communicated our enthusiasm, joy and
  love and I felt at home. It just shows that you just never know what can be experienced
  around the corner. It seems most of the memorable and soul nourishing moments are
  when you unexpectedly find beautiful connections and understanding with others in
  unexpected places. And further surprises were served. Not only did we get warm sticky
  rice and fish to enjoy but also a more unusual dish of pig's intestines to try.
  Life is truly for exploring all the corners within ourselves as well as the corners
  of the world while savoring all of the surprises along the journey.
