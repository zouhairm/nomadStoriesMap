Text: "On one of this days when nothing seemed real anymore I saw him,the mad Max,he\
  \ was swimming in the neon lights listening to the void in my head.There was a heavy\
  \ rain outside and jazz playing on the edges of reality I built when my world met\
  \ the collapse.\nMusic.My saviour.It begins and continues all my travels.Bit.Just\
  \ listen.I make it.Like a ghosts me and Max are tearing up the space.Tonight will\
  \ be the start.\nThoughts are going back to childhood when my brother bought an\
  \ old record-player.Morning with the smell of vanilla candles,my mom\u2019s coffee\
  \ and her impeccable perfume.I\u2019ve chosen the record,I put it into the player.Hit\
  \ the road Jack,and don\u2019t you come back no more.Repeat.My teeth in a dental\
  \ plate showed off with the smile.Then I had my first mp3 player.Lera is home alone\
  \ and she wants to perform.Look,people are waiting for you,they want to dance,you\
  \ have to make them move,faster !I put my headphones on and make the show start.\n\
  Pictures are going so quickly I don\u2019t even want to control them anymore.Road\
  \ seems endless,dark continues dark,we\u2019re holding our sweaty hands with absolute\
  \ happiness in our hearts.Escape succeed.Our naked minds and bodies met mourning\
  \ in a mountain forest.Max taught me how to listen and see through light.The goal\
  \ was to see the mountains and Heath,the local mage.Heath gave us obscure coordinates\
  \ of his current location while he was drinking some whiskey in a stinky bar,and\
  \ said that if we found him,he will introduce us to the gods of bit and we\u2019\
  ll have a fight.If we lose,they\u2019ll dip us in the silver waters of perception.\n\
  For a second I thought that I\u2019ve made a mistake.It\u2019s no secret,that if\
  \ you want more,you have to do even more,but maybe my calling is making sandwiches\
  \ in local restaurant,living an ordinary life,watching my future kids grow older,counting\
  \ my wrinkles,eating oatflakes for breakfast at 8 a.m. while watching news about\
  \ the man from a Ukrainian town Colomiya,who\u2019s making dinosaurs from wood in\
  \ his garage ?The only reason why I haven\u2019t quit the game was our duel with\
  \ gods.I didn\u2019t want Max to fight alone.\nAs the new king and queen of the\
  \ woods,we made flower crowns.Then I heard strange voices.It was a howl of gods.\n\
  We were playing back to back.Those divine creatures were laughing at us but looking\
  \ deeply in my shiny eyes.I smile in return and understand that accidentally I won\
  \ the game.I made the gods move.\n\n- One cheeseburger and big French fries with\
  \ ketchup,please."
