Text: "Normal, normal, normal. I feel as if that is the recurring theme of my life,\
  \ and I doubt that I will ever escape it's grasp. I was raised by normal parents\
  \ and grew in a normal neighborhood in a very normal high school right in the heart\
  \ of Boston. I got a normal accounting degree and found work right after at a normal\
  \ accounting firm. \n\nMy current assignment Japan however has been an outlier on\
  \ the linear path my life has been taking. I've been working at one of Tokyo's central\
  \ business districts, Marunouchi, for three weeks now and everything has been abnormal\
  \ so far. \n\nWork seems more like a competition in Japan as it's dead silent in\
  \ the office during work hours. Moreover, everyone works overtime without fail,\
  \ which is frustrating because I would much rather go home on time and grab a beer.\
  \ \n\nLuckily, not everyone enjoys working overtime here either as I was able to\
  \ make a friend, Takashi, who leaves early just like I do. Despite only knowing\
  \ him for a few days, I've got to know just about everything about him from his\
  \ life goals to things like his extra toe. It honestly feels like I've known him\
  \ my whole life, even though our perspectives on some things are very much different.\n\
  \nOh yeah, it so happens that I'm spending my weekend with him and his girlfriend,\
  \ Naoko, at Osaka Castle right now. He made the mistake of betting with me on the\
  \ last Red Sox game (Of course I would bet for them to win), and now has to tour\
  \ me and Naoko around his hometown. \n\nNaoko and I both share a knack of teasing\
  \ Takashi, and I'd say he is really lucky to be with her. I myself don't have a\
  \ girlfriend, and I have been that way my entire life (No, I have never had a boyfriend\
  \ either. I'm pretty sure I'm not gay). Now that I think about it, I probably didn't\
  \ want to be normal and be like everyone else in high school with their rampant\
  \ hormones and emotions.\n\nThe sand makes a delightful crunch under the soles of\
  \ my shoes while I munch away on a soft and chewy egg-yolk-filled onigiri. I look\
  \ up to Osaka Castle for the nth time, and the mix of green, gold and white still\
  \ leaves me awestruck. Everything is not normal, and I'm loving every second of\
  \ it. \n\nTakashi motions for me to hurry up, and I jog towards him. I bump into\
  \ a woman who was standing a little to the right, and quickly apologize. I look\
  \ up and see what has to be the most beautiful living creature I have seen in my\
  \ life. I mean, not even Osaka Castle can...\n\n\"Umm, yellow. Face.\"\n\nThank\
  \ you egg-yolk-filled onigiri."
