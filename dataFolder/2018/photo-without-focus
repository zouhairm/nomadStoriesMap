Text: "After four exciting days in Israel my best friend Daniel and I were heading\
  \ to the Dead Sea and the siege of Masada. As is was Saturday so everything was\
  \ closed cause of the Sabbath. Against all rules we took our rental car and drove\
  \ right threw Palestine to reach an open market to get some food and water for our\
  \ road trip. The navigation leaded us out of the Old Town directly along the wall,\
  \ which splits up these to countries. Which splits up these two peoples. For myself\
  \ it was a very confusing feeling. My own parents grown up in the German Democratic\
  \ Republic. A country which had is own wall to isolate humans from each other, who\
  \ belongs normally together. For me it was just a short moment of my free life.\
  \ But for my parents it were the half of there lifetime. We arrived a small supermarket\
  \ run by a Arabic man. Daniel went into the shop but I needed some moments to get\
  \ in touch with the area. It was already October but still hot. I smelled the dust\
  \ in the air. Behind me I sensed the spirit of the Old Town of Jerusalem with all\
  \ these religious monuments. My real view now gazed to a urban settlement on a dusty\
  \ hill. I saw the beginning desert behind at all. Like being in a tunnel my mobile\
  \ was in my hand ready to take a photo. In this moment the Arabic shop owner, who\
  \ doesn't see tourists very often, stood next to me. \n\"From what are you taking\
  \ a photo?\"\nGood question without a real answer.\n\"I don't really know\" was\
  \ my reply.\n\"So why you are doing it?\"\n\"Perhaps I am a dumb tourist like the\
  \ most and I have to take photos of everything. Or I am just afraid of the moment\
  \ I will talk about this situation and have no photo of this to remember every feeling\
  \ right now.\"\nHe wanted to say something but stopped before saying any word but\
  \ then. \n\"It is unusual to have tourists in this area. Of course you can take\
  \ a photo of everything you want, but I was just wondering what is here so special\
  \ for you.\"\n\"I don't know if it is special, but it is different to home.\"\n\
  Then he started to laughing. \"I always thought we are the only idiots, who are\
  \ interested in this big piece of dust. But now it is good to know that there are\
  \ somebody else.\"\nHe tapped my shoulder and pointed into his shop. I followed\
  \ him and told him our goals for today.\n\"So if you tell about your experience\
  \ here, please tell everybody of the best hummus in your life.\"\nHe gave us a big\
  \ portion of hummus and too much pita bread for two.\n\"Perhaps one day I come to\
  \ Germany and take photos just of the snow.\""
