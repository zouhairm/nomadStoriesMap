Text: "\u201CFor a tropical island, this place is absolutely freezing.\u201D \n\n\
  I would have never guessed that I would be wearing a jumper, gloves and a woollen\
  \ beanie in a country that was less than 800 kilometres from the equator, but such\
  \ are the intricacies of the climate that envelope the vibrant island nation of\
  \ Sri Lanka. The hill country town of Nuwara Eliya, situated almost two kilometres\
  \ above sea level, is so far removed from many typical travel guide images of this\
  \ island that you would often forget that you were actually visiting the subcontinent.\
  \ In colonial times this quaint township was known as \u2018Little England\u2019\
  \ and formed the ideal holiday place for many British settlers when they needed\
  \ time off from overseeing their vast tea plantations in nearby villages. With the\
  \ average temperature barely reaching above 25 degrees centigrade all year round,\
  \ living in Nuwara Eliya was the only memory of home these Englishmen could experience,\
  \ whilst the rest of Ceylon gave them a culture shock akin to the likes of landing\
  \ on Mars. \n\nMy teeth continued to chatter away uncontrollably as I eagerly gobbled\
  \ up another hand-rolled ball of warm rice mixed with lentil curry and dried fish.\
  \ It was currently eight degrees out here on our balcony overlooking the hilly Kandyan\
  \ jungles and this plate of delicious Sri Lankan cuisine was my only source of warmth\
  \ in an environment so cold you could actually see your own breath when you exhaled.\
  \ My cousin just smiled teasingly at me. \n\n\u201CYou know, for a Sri Lankan boy\
  \ who grew up in Australia, I thought you would be used to this weather by now,\u201D\
  \ he remarked. \n\n\u201CTrust me aiya, Melbourne weather is a totally different\
  \ ball game!\u201D I protested jokingly, \u201CImagine being chased by an elephant,\
  \ whilst dodging three-wheel drivers and motorcyclists down Colombo\u2019s busiest\
  \ highway. That is our weather for you!\u201D  \n\nI hoped this analogy had given\
  \ him some idea of the unpredictability of the climate I was accustomed to, but\
  \ my cousin remained unperturbed. \n\n\u201CSo?\u201D he asked, unfazed, \u201C\
  I dodge three-wheel drivers and motorcyclists all the time! That\u2019s why I bought\
  \ a mini cooper in the first place!\u201D \n\nAs we both burst out in jubilant laughter,\
  \ the air became filled with the enchanting sound of an azan, whilst classic Tamil\
  \ songs and Buddhist chanting ensued from the nearby temple. It made me ponder,\
  \ as Sri Lanka\u2019s rich heritage often draws similarities to Melbourne\u2019\
  s weather. Its this unpredictability that has helped shaped the diversity of cultures\
  \ witnessed today."
