Text: "I was standing there finally. In France, the country that I had come to adore\
  \ based initially only on the very sound of the name. I was 3 years old when I fell\
  \ in love with that mythical name and placed it among the ranks of unicorns and\
  \ fairy god mothers. I had read the books, studied the language and here I was.\
  \ Completely unprepared. \nGrimy from at least 32 hours of straight travel. Exhausted.\
  \ Hung-over from cheap airline beer and weak coffee. I fumbled my way through my\
  \ 1st period French as I attempted to exchange our currency for some coins so my\
  \ travel companion and I could use the bathroom. Paying for the potty!?? Such a\
  \ strange concept to our foreign ears!\n30 minutes later I stagger to the edge of\
  \ the Gard de Nor and stand transfixed in my travel exhaustion and my complete travel\
  \ shock. I try to soak in the late evening light as the sun coats the age old architecture\
  \ in a golden glow, post rain. We have no place to stay, we have made no reservations.\
  \ Intent on the adventure, back packs on our backs in the years before cell phones\
  \ and internet. What do we do now?\nWe navigate to a wall map and in the process\
  \ bump into a couple of girls like us but from another country. We huddle together\
  \ in discussion and appear as one backpacker group when he approaches. Ono sees\
  \ us and recognizes us as the group he was sent \"to save\" he says. He has a brochure\
  \ of his family hostile and paid train tickets to get us there. As a group we go,\
  \ thinking the other group had called him, not realizing no one had. \nOno explains\
  \ he was sleeping when he was suddenly taken by the idea that someone needed his\
  \ help at the subway. He went there straight away and finds us. \nWe arrive at a\
  \ plain looking high rise apartment building. Upon entering at 10pm at  night we\
  \ are greeted warmly by the Korean family as they help us out of our shoes and heavy\
  \ bags. Ushered towards a cramped kitchen and fed well amid French soap opera playing\
  \ on the Television. We are pushed towards a warm bath and then after shown our\
  \ clean bunk areas in the small 3 bedroom apartment. We spend the next 2 days with\
  \ this family. Mixing with German, French, Korean and Scandinavian. I find in this\
  \ the first layer of my Nationality as an American is shed. I pull free from this\
  \ outer shell like a snake freeing itself from the old skin. \nThe world enters\
  \ a new focus as I see fully that we are not just a multitude of individual nations\
  \ but a collection of many human lives, all as much similar as we are different."
