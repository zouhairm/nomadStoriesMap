Text: "After being dropped off at the bus station by my Korean host mom, I impatiently\
  \ waited for my 3pm bus from Seoul to Pyeontaek to visit an old friend. Once I finished\
  \ reading all the Korean signs in the bus station, I still had 45 minutes left to\
  \ go. So, I took out my notebook and started journaling about my trip.\n\nJust as\
  \ I was getting absorbed in my own thoughts and cultural observations, I was abruptly\
  \ drawn out of my contemplative state by a Korean ajussi (a term of respect used\
  \ for older Korean men) who said: \u201CSo, you\u2019re writing in English eh?\u201D\
  \ \n\nUsually, I\u2019m not one to be shy about talking to people, but this was\
  \ different because the ajussi was trying to speak to me in Korean. Even though\
  \ I felt very uncomfortable with the idea at first, I decided to try to talk to\
  \ him anyway. Much to my surprise, I was actually able to communicate far more in\
  \ Korean than I expected. \n\nBut the best part was when the ajussi discovered that\
  \ I lived in the UAE. His eyes immediately lit up and he eagerly asked me question\
  \ after question about Dubai and what life was like there. However, responding to\
  \ his questions wasn\u2019t very easy, because not only was he speaking in Korean;\
  \ he also had an accent from the eastern region of Andong. \n\nI was so busy trying\
  \ to answer all of the ajussi\u2019s questions, that I almost didn\u2019t realize\
  \ it was 2:50pm. Even though I wanted to continue speaking to him, I decided it\
  \ was best for me to go to the restroom one last time before getting on the bus.\
  \ So, I excused myself and went. \nHowever, after I left the restroom, I tried to\
  \ look for my new friend to say goodbye. But he was nowhere to be found. Disappointed,\
  \ I decided to walk to door three to catch my bus and then I was surprised to see\
  \ the ajussi jovially chatting to my bus driver. \n\nAs I walked towards the bus,\
  \ I heard the ajussi say to my bus driver: \u201Cthis is the Dubai agassi (young\
  \ lady in Korean) I was telling you about! Please take care of her.\u201D Then he\
  \ turned to me and said: \u201Cthe bus driver was going to leave without you, but\
  \ I told him to wait.\u201D I thanked the ajussi profusely for his kindness and\
  \ then I took my sit. \n\nAs I sat down, I started to think about how afraid I had\
  \ been to travel to South Korea wearing the hijab before that moment. Honestly,\
  \ the last thing I ever expected was to encounter so much kindness from complete\
  \ strangers- like the Andong ajussi. This trip always reminds me of the power of\
  \ humanity to overcome all barriers and prejudice."
