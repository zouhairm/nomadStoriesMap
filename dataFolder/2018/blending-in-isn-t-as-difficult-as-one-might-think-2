Text: "As an U.S. American you\u2019re often told that traveling can be dangerous\
  \ or bothersome due to potential dangers such as targeting for theft, kid napping,\
  \ or conflict over the general dislike of our home county causing many to avoid\
  \ going anywhere outside the states. While blending in isn\u2019t always easy due\
  \ to my rich southern accent, simply being silent and speaking Spanish seemed to\
  \ draw me no attention at all. As I look around the metros and plazas I find that\
  \ there are many who stick out far more than I do, and many more who look just like\
  \ me, leading me to wonder where this stigma over traveling comes from. As society\
  \ marches forward to become more unified and civilized I have seen proof first hand\
  \ that people are up to the challenge, despite the anti immigration and far-right\
  \ movements taking place across the western world. Times like these should not be\
  \ seen a call to take three steps back, but a call for others like you and I to\
  \ branch out an show the world the benefits of cultural mix. Surprising to many,\
  \ my home town of Louisville, Kentucky taught me this with their acceptance of refugees\
  \ from around the world whom I have had the opportunity to work and volunteer with.\
  \ This cultural mix has helped make my home a vibrant and diverse place where cultures\
  \ have come together to grow the local economy through quality workers filling positions\
  \ at major corporations to the creation of small business based on the skills and\
  \ abilities of the immigrants that start them. Evidence like this is information\
  \ that can teach separatist societies such as Catalunya to remain unified amidst\
  \ conflicting political movements. The separatist movement in Catalunya has been\
  \ a peaceful one and one of tact, but still left me with some expectation of dislike\
  \ as I visited the family of my girlfriend; with rumor they were unaccepting of\
  \ tourists, immigrants, and other Spaniards a like I have seen no ill will or attitud\
  \ towards us as we travel through the major cities, even if my accent slips out\
  \ in conversation it is typically met with laughter or a slight smile. Our time\
  \ in Barcelona has been amazing and far more enjoyable than Madrid despite this\
  \ being the focal point of the movement. Barcelona is a diverse city where we have\
  \ encountered people from around the world, who like me have no trouble navigating\
  \ and blending in with a local population of Spanish, Chinese, and other Europeans.\
  \ My advice to anyone with a fear of traveling is to throw it away, learn a new\
  \ language, and go!"
