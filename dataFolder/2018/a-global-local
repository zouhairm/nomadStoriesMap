Text: "\u201CMiss, you dropped your fur scarf,\u201D noted the lady beside me at the\
  \ nail salon as she handed me my item.\n\nI thanked her and smiled. As I sat back\
  \ down in my manicure chair, she exclaimed, \u201CYou look so fancy! You came from\
  \ a party?\u201D \n\nConfused, I glanced down at my business attire and clarified,\
  \ \u201CNo, I had a conference at work.\u201D\n\n\u201CWow, you work in an office?\u201D\
  \ she responded, eyes wide in astonishment. \u201CI have never seen an immigrant\
  \ work in an office before.\u201D\n\nAt first, I couldn\u2019t fathom her shock.\n\
  \nI was not an immigrant to Spain. I\u2019m a Canadian who worked for a global media\
  \ company that assigned me to various countries. Madrid was my company\u2019s HQ\
  \ and a city I frequented over the last decade. \n\nMy confusion then turned to\
  \ indignation, then into a sharp stabbing pain.\n\nAs a graduate of an elite university\
  \ in Canada with a Master\u2019s degree from the UK and a middle class upbringing,\
  \ I was deeply offended by her utter shock that I held a white-collar job, as it\
  \ was commensurate to my background. Yet in the context of a quaint Vietnamese-ran\
  \ nail salon in Madrid frequented by African and Latinx migrant groups, a woman\
  \ of colour like me conversing in Spanish fluently (yet without the native colloquialism)\
  \ led her to a stereotyped conclusion: a migrant worker assimilating to the local\
  \ culture.\n\nHaving traveled/worked/lived in over 30 countries, I saw a pattern\
  \ (much to my surprise as well) wherein I\u2019m presumed to be a local or member\
  \ of a cultural diaspora instead of a visitor: I was mistaken as a Brazilian ESL\
  \ student in Ireland; a Kazakh migrant in Russia; a Filipina nanny in Singapore;\
  \ a local in Colombia, Malaysia, Morocco and India, among others. Being multilingual,\
  \ though a travel asset, has also been a double-edged sword that led to microaggressions.\n\
  \nMy ambiguity has often served many great advantages for me. Yet at times, it has\
  \ caused me to feel robbed of the privilege of distant wonderment as a curious outsider\
  \ when I\u2019m automatically thrust into racially-based social stratifications\
  \ in unfamiliar lands. \n\nThe false labels themselves do not offend me; it\u2019\
  s the narrative of inferiority \u2013 that is especially affixed to women of colour\
  \ \u2013 behind the labels that drives me livid. Though these were only a small\
  \ minority of my experiences, the wounds were profound. \n\nWhile rhetoric of representation\
  \ is slowly starting to seep into mainstream discourse, I realized that, here too,\
  \ in travel literature, it\u2019s needed.  \n\nI can be part of the global local\
  \ voice."
