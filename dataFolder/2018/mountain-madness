Text: "The Kullu Valley in Himanchal Pradesh. No picture or video can do justice to\
  \ the overwhelming feeling of being in this blessed country. \nThere are two things\
  \ you learn from a 'pahadi' or a mountain person. First of which is that you don't\
  \ climb a mountain, you amble along the path that takes you to the top. I had the\
  \ pleasure of ambling with Mr. Shappu Negi, a true hero who spearheads 'The Himalayan\
  \ Rescue'. A hero because he has saved the lives of countless people from all over\
  \ the world. The weather in the mountains is a fickle mistress. One moment, it is\
  \ sunny, and the next, it is raining heavily. As a result, a lot of climbers get\
  \ stuck due to storms or lose their way. Mr. Negi is the guy who braves his life\
  \ and saves them, sometimes with the help of the government helicopter. The second,\
  \ hospitality.\n\nIn our excitement, we decided to scale a mountain with a seventy-five\
  \ degree incline and visit the fabled village of Malana. We were taking breaks every\
  \ 15 minutes and walking on edges for a good 2.5 kilometers. Both of us were carrying\
  \ heavy bags as we decided to save Rs. 500 by not taking along a porter. We ultimately\
  \ reached the top in around 2 hours, huffing and puffing, only to welcomed by the\
  \ local congregation at the top who were watching us scale the mountain. They told\
  \ us that only the villages trekked on this path and the visitors take a much simpler\
  \ path through the valley. Happy after receiving accolades, we continued to march\
  \ on into the village.\nThe secret of Malana is that the natives believe that they\
  \ are the descendants of King Alexander who had sown his seed here while passing\
  \ through the Himalayas while returning from China. As a result, the locals believe\
  \ that they are the true blue bloods. We realised that we couldn't enter the houses,\
  \ the temples or even exchange money with our hands. In order to buy a bottle of\
  \ water, we had to keep the money on the ground and the shopkeeper placed the bottle\
  \ on the ground for the exchange to happen.\nWe narrated our encounter to Negi who\
  \ made us understand that the village was seeing unprecedented popularity in the\
  \ past few years but the villagers were still uneducated and primitive. The newer\
  \ generation, the ones that welcomed us after our climb, were a lot more progressive.\
  \ Being a native, he was working in the situation but he admitted it was hard. Just\
  \ then, Mrs. Negi entered with 'Rajma chawal' and everything was forgotten as we\
  \ tucked into the food and Mrs. Negi looked on, smiling."
