Text: "My first hitchhike was in early spring 2011. A year shy of getting my driver\u2019\
  s license, my parents had a deal that they would drive me to the ski mountain if\
  \ I found a ride home. After a day of glorious slush and sloppy turns, the mountain\
  \ was closing and I realized I didn\u2019t have a ride home. With my skis over my\
  \ shoulder and my boots in my left hand I set off, optimistic I could hitch a ride\
  \ along the rural New England roadway.\nA half mile along I struck gold. A man securing\
  \ a tarp in the back of his pickup saw me trudging by and offered a ride. He introduced\
  \ himself as Sim and I hopped aboard while he tucked my skis into the bed.\nWe were\
  \ barely underway when he broke the news.\n\u201CI\u2019ll drive you all the way,\
  \ but I have to drop something off in Boston Corner on the way, is that cool?\u201D\
  \nNot knowing what to say, I grunted and held on tight as Sim jumped the truck off\
  \ the main road and down onto the primitive byways of the Mount Washington State\
  \ Forest.\nBoston Corner is 1000 acres of quiet farmland in Columbia County, NY.\
  \ An 1878 description of the hamlet reads \u201CThe Taconic mountains form an almost\
  \ impassable barrier between this spot and the seat of civil authority, and Boston\
  \ Corner became a city of refuge for criminals and outlaws of all classes, who fled\
  \ to it to escape the reach of the law.\u201D\nThe hamlet hasn\u2019t changed much\
  \ since then. Houses are few and far between and the roads are silent in their natural\
  \ seclusion.\nSim and I talked skiing until we pulled up to a little farmhouse with\
  \ a line of cars parked out front. I offered a hand unloading, figuring he was dropping\
  \ off a couple of kegs, only to find that it was two large conga drums under the\
  \ tarp.\nWe walked around the house into a large garden where a party was in full\
  \ swing.\n\u201CI picked up Jordan on the road,\u201D Sim explained. \u201CHe was\
  \ hiking with his skis, can you believe it?\u201D\n\u201CWell grab something to\
  \ eat and join us!\u201D someone hollered.\nI was immediately made welcome. The\
  \ guests filled me in on the history and lore of Boston Corner and I discovered\
  \ I was crashing the first meeting of the year for the Taconic Hills Drum Circle.\
  \ As the sun went down everyone gathered around a campfire to play their varied\
  \ instruments. It was a scene out of Shakespeare and an hour later, Sim drove me\
  \ back to reality.\nThough I was not far from home, this was a formative experience.\
  \ I gained the confidence to trust the kindness of strangers and learned about a\
  \ place and a people I was unaware of."
