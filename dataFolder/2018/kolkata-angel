Text: "\u201CHelp me sister, please help me\u2026.\u201D The plaintive cries swirl\
  \ through the dust and traffic as I and the other volunteers walk to our favourite\
  \ lassi stall. To my horror we\u2019ve been set upon by a group of women, arms outstretched,\
  \ begging with babes in arms.\n\u201CMy baby is hungry,\u201D one woman cries.\n\
  I am hardened and wise after two weeks in India. I stare straight ahead. Those who\
  \ show weakness will be set upon with renewed vigour. Besides, giving to beggars\
  \ solves nothing.\n\u201CFive rupees? Just five rupees?\u201D she begs for a pitiful\
  \ 5p. When I shake my head firmly, she angers: \u201CWhy? Don\u2019t you care about\
  \ poor people? You are so rich and I am so poor. Don\u2019t you care?\u201D Her\
  \ words hit me like a blow. I pause.\nMy companions hurry off, leaving me and the\
  \ woman alone. I look at her properly for the first time. \u201CDo you want a lassi?\u201D\
  \ I ask.\n\u201CYes,\u201D she replies.\nWe walk to a grotty little hole-in-the-wall\
  \ shop, where benches and metal chairs spill into the street. The woman sits beside\
  \ me and I fear the proprietor will shoo her away.\n\u201CWhich lassi do you want?\u201D\
  \ I ask.\n\u201CBanana,\u201D she replies. \u201CNo\u2026 mango.\u201D\nWe are soon\
  \ sipping the cool sweet yoghurt. \n\u201CHow old is your baby?\u201D I ask, admiring\
  \ her little one.\n\u201CSix months.\u201D\n\u201CShe\u2019s beautiful.\u201D Mum\u2019\
  s face remains impassive.\n\u201CHow many children do you have?\u201D I flail at\
  \ small talk.\n\u201CFive.\u201D Her face despairs.\nShe may be 30 years old but\
  \ her lined face is tired and sad. \n\u201CHere, you hold.\u201D She plonks the\
  \ baby on my lap and takes a metal flask from the folds of her sari. She decants\
  \ what remains of her lassi. \u201CI\u2019ll give this to my other daughter\u2026\
  \ she\u2019s working.\u201D \nThe warm lump on my lap wriggles and smells of baby.\
  \ She looks well fed; there is fat on her little arms with which she beats the air.\
  \ Her eyes, big black pools, look up at me from beneath her short, oiled black hair.\
  \ A smudge on her forehead marks her as Hindu.\nHer mother is asking me for a bag\
  \ of rice when her other daughter arrives. The five-year-old is barefoot, her clothes\
  \ filthy. She gulps the lassi her mum has saved.\nThe woman gossips about the Westerners\
  \ passing by. \u201CThat one there, he\u2019s crazy,\u201D she confides. \u201C\
  Really. He\u2019s no good.\u201D\nWe are drawing a small crowd - this white woman\
  \ with a brown baby on her lap chatting to a beggar.\nAnother beggar with a baby\
  \ joins us. She stands and just smiles and smiles, rays of sunshine glowing from\
  \ her face.\n\u201CWhy is she smiling?\u201D I wonder suspiciously, waiting for\
  \ the sting. \nIt\u2019s only afterwards I realise she may have been from elsewhere."
