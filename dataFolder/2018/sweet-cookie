Text: "When I travelled from Grey City to Green Valley, I wanted to live something\
  \ different. I moved to a friend\u2019s house and I told her I would be out for\
  \ a few days. Renting cars, going up and down, in and out of little old towns which\
  \ looked more like fancy stages than original villages, cheap food and rude people.\
  \ I felt like a stranger. So I went back to my friend\u2019s sooner than I expected.\
  \ Something was wrong but I couldn\u2019t tell what it was. I didn\u2019t know.\
  \ One night, I was feeling blue and didn\u2019t want to go out, but she made me\
  \ to. \n\nShe lived in a little village up in a hill, at the south of the valley.\
  \ It didn\u2019t have anything of tourist interest, so they had a quiet summer.\
  \ We went to the church. It seemed like the whole village was there. There was a\
  \ line coming from the portal of the crypt under the church. A faint light came\
  \ out from the inside. We got in. The crypt seemed very old yet it was all clean\
  \ and enlightened with torches and candles. It was stuffed with wooden tables and\
  \ chairs and full of sweet smells, laughing voices and waiters carrying delightful\
  \ dishes all around. We seated at a table near the stone wall and she ordered the\
  \ dinner for the both of us.\n\nA wooden plate of smoked cured ham and regional\
  \ cheeses with black olives stuffed breath was the first order. The main dish, a\
  \ simple yet delicious picci with garlic and natural tomato sauce. All washed down\
  \ with a local red wine. We talked for what seemed centuries about the solitude\
  \ and l\u2019amore. Coming from her lips everything sounded smoother. But the best\
  \ was yet to come. \nWith a half-smile, she ordered the typical dessert. The dessert\
  \ consisted of a few sweet hard-to-bite cookies stuffed with almonds and dry fruit\
  \ and a little cup of sweet wine with a caramel-like colour. Surprisingly, the typical\
  \ dessert was my favourite sweet, carquinyolis, something I\u2019d been eating since\
  \ my childhood at home when my grandma came to get me after school and bought me\
  \ something so I would do my homework. \n\nEverything looked different then. Colors\
  \ were brighter, flavours tasted softer. People now seemed more open. Nothing looked\
  \ strange to me then, because I felt like I was at home again. \n\nThe point of\
  \ travelling is the experience. What makes you feel alive when you\u2019re far from\
  \ home is the experience you get. That\u2019s what travelling does to you. Find\
  \ your reason and try to figure out what lies beneath it. My reason is to find home\
  \ far from where I was born. To find a home anywhere so I can find me."
