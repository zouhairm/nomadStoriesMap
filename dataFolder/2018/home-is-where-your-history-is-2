Text: "1948. A man called Giacomo leaves his hometown in southern Italy, Calabria,\
  \ to try a better life in another country. In that part of Europe, life was almost\
  \ impossible after the Second World war. He goes then to Brazil, bringing along\
  \ with him his wife, Maria Luisa and his five children, Stella, Nina, Lucia, Pierina\
  \ and Battista. \n\nAnyone who has been in southern Italy lately will tell you that\
  \ today it is a very different place. If Giacomo could see it, he wouldn\u2019t\
  \ believe. He would find breathtaking views, yes, but also museums, culture, night\
  \ life\u2026 his beloved Calabria has now even its on University: Universit\xE0\
  \ della Calabria.\n\nI must say, that from all southern Italy regions, Calabria\
  \ has a particular flavor. It is hard to name that flavor. One could say it is something\
  \ like Peperoncino, the famous pepper that has such an important place on southern\
  \ Italy\u2019s cuisine. Or this flavor could be something like the Fichi Secchi,\
  \ figs that are dried to last the whole winter; a habit that, according to locals,\
  \ exists since immemorial times.\n\nFood truly plays an important part. But the\
  \ flavor that one feels in Calabria has everything and nothing to do with food.\
  \ Food simply brings people together. The people from Calabria, i calabresi, are\
  \ the real source of this region\u2019s special flavor. \n\nThat is specially truth\
  \ if you are an Italian descendant; then the whole region becomes a big family.\
  \ \nSo, when someone goes to work or study or visit, someone let\u2019s say, like\
  \ Giacomo\u2019s granddaughter, that person will receive a truly warm welcome home.\
  \ And sentences like: \u201Ci have a cousin in Brazil, do you think you might know\
  \ him?\u201D become a delicious routine.\n\nThis happens because almost every family\
  \ in Calabria has a branch of emigrants. In every corner it is possible to hear\
  \ stories of all the many relatives who left everything to find a better life in\
  \ the unknown. And the feeling of being apart from ones family still pulses strongly.\
  \ \n\nYes, i am Giacomo\u2019s granddaughter, and i found, between conversations\
  \ in restaurants with strangers and stories from the past, that home that is. The\
  \ reason for that is a simple one, but very often forgot: the story of emigration\
  \ is not only the stories of those who leave, but also of those who stay. And more\
  \ than any one care to remember, it is the story of those who are the emigrants\
  \ sons, daughters, grandsons and granddaughters. We, the descendants, find, sooner\
  \ or later, and somethings without expecting, that we have, indeed, two homes."
