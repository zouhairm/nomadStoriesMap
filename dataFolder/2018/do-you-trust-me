  \ Me.\n\nHis did.\n\nI was floating in a Guatemalan jungle pool when a forehead\
  \ broached the water, followed by a pair of brown eyes. They were a manifestation\
  \ of curiosity and adventure. Returning the smile, I gave the floating head a nod\
  \ hello. The forehead and eyes rose above the water revealing the beaming face of\
  \ a young man.\n\nOla\n\nGrinning, he extended a hand and announced: David.  His\
  \ eyes gleamed with mirth at my firm grip upon his palm. Then, he was pulling me\
  \ swiftly towards the waterfall.  I studied him, one eyebrow arched. The rock behind\
  \ the wall of water appeared very solid, and tales of foolish tourists pummelled\
  \ by the immense pressure of waterfalls flooded my mind. Eyes grinning, he let go\
  \ and dove under the deluge. Moments later, the water above parted and a single\
  \ hand shot through, beckoning me forward. I took a gulp of air (and courage) and\
  \ plunged through. There, behind the waterfall in a glistening cave, sitting upon\
  \ a rock shelf was my new Guatemalan friend.\n\nAs he led me through a labyrinth\
  \ of tunnels, the roar of the waterfall rendered any attempts at verbal communication\
  \ pointless. Raised brows, encouraging smiles and nervous laughter was our language,\
  \ and when the tunnels became so dark I couldn\u2019t see the glint in his eyes,\
  \ his strong hands would guide me on. Far into the dark maze we plummeted down a\
  \ hole in the rock and splashed into cavernous pool. Calmly, he pulled me towards\
  \ the jagged bottom of the pool and gestured to a small opening in the rock. I hesitated,\
  \ doubting his broad shoulders could fit though. I kicked back to the surface, shaking\
  \ my head. I couldn\u2019t do it. He appeared for long enough to fill his lungs\
  \ with air, shot me a beseeching look and then dove out of sight. I was alone.\n\
  I dove to the hole and started to worm my way through. It was tight. The hot rocks\
  \ cut into my skin, and my lungs burned. The water ahead of me was cool to touch\
  \ while the water behind me was warm and thick. I wiggled my body, slowing with\
  \ each kick, clawing at the edges of the tunnel.\nStrong hands grabbed my wrists\
  \ and yanked me through to the other side of the tunnel; into a new cave, into freedom,\
  \ into air. Sparkling reflections from this new cave of wonders glittered in his\
  \ eyes as they sought out mine. As he lent forward, his eyes expressed the words\
  \ every traveller longs to hear, only this time they held an invitation to a different\
  \ kind of adventure. Trust me?"
