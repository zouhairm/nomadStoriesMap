Text: "I lay there spread-eagled on the cold, hard, stone slab in the forest clearing.\
  \ I opened my eyes to see my limbs tied to iron clasps hammered securely into the\
  \ ground. The feeling of this rock was a commodity, as my body already started to\
  \ ooze in sweat, drenched as I lay still. I pulled on the fasteners but it was useless,\
  \ I was well constrained and only a key would free me. It was dusk; the sun slowly\
  \ setting and the forest growing darker. As I lay there, eyes closed and exhausted,\
  \ my other senses became sharper and I could hear leaves starting to rustle in the\
  \ forest. The monotonous drone of insects started to populate the forest for their\
  \ night excursion.  If there was one thing I hated since I was young, it was the\
  \ continuous humming of a mosquito, waking me up from a deep slumber on a cold winter\u2019\
  s night and I would not be able to go back to sleep until I found the culprit, and\
  \ splattered its small body against the wall of my bedroom. Now, as I lay there,\
  \ I could hear not just one but hundreds surrounding me. I tried relentlessly, pulling\
  \ again with my limbs but failed and slumped back in fatigue. The dark cloud of\
  \ insects started to emerge from the woodland and hovered over my bare body, smelling\
  \ the sweet aroma of my blood, now pounding with adrenaline coursing through my\
  \ veins. They descended slowly in spiral motion to partake in this feast of sweet\
  \ nectar, the smell drawing them like moths to a light bulb.\nSquirming in panic,\
  \ pulling with my legs and arms, I tried to wriggle my helpless body away from the\
  \ insects as they started to gorge, but it was only a temporary relief. They would\
  \ fly off and seconds later land again on another body part to steal another vial\
  \ of blood. My body was quickly filling with red marks as I lay there powerless,\
  \ an easy prey for the hungry insects as they descended. Frustration was building\
  \ and I shouted to an empty clearing to no apparent avail. As my eyes grew heavy\
  \ and my body succumbed to weakness, I heard leaves rustle in the forest behind\
  \ me, now a larger body that seemed to break twigs in its path. I had no energy,\
  \ or courage, to raise my head to peak, but could only imagine the beast that was\
  \ drawing closer. Then, the shrubs in front of me seemed to waver and make way for\
  \ a black spot, and as it drew closer and larger, it turned into a figure, which\
  \ turned into a man, and in one of his hands was the glint of a key\u2026 the last\
  \ thing I expected."
