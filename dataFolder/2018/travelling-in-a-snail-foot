Text: "My great journey to the erstwhile Portuguese colony Goa, first trip was with\
  \ my friends with bucket list & a friend to help us in North Goa.Ran into different\
  \ trains, slept by standing. Immersed into the area,observed people.A place of different\
  \ cultural interaction & styles.I was fledgling as a volunteer in Aam Aadmi Party\
  \ (AAP) & saw some posters & wanted to join, unfortunately didn\u2019t get chance\
  \ & the tour ended hoping to return.It happened 7 times, to all nook & corner, experienced\
  \ everything like a Goan when I got the opportunity to volunteer in AAP & started\
  \ the snail-foot travel.Train journey, talking to strangers, sharing food,I reached\
  \ South Goa & first local connection escorted me to an apartment of 8. started my\
  \ work, met the other volunteers. Went to meet different people, listened to problems\
  \ even worse.I got to know the area & people. Used eat Tiffin. After realising \
  \ problem within volunteers & inefficiency, To check for some scope I headed to\
  \ North Goa again, met my friends\u2019 sister whom I still call as \u2018sis\u2019\
  \ of mine,met her & surprisingly saw the AAP office right above our head which I\
  \ missed on first tour. I met them & fixed for next Voluntourism in December & went\
  \ back to South. At midnight walking through the empty streets back home. December\
  \ vacation the most unforgettable journey to the place. Like a lone ranger running\
  \ after the train, roaming &searching for pickup to my accommodation with Biharis\
  \ & Rajasthanis.Went to every house, knew their Christmas, tasted variety of homemade\
  \ wine, then an unexpected bike journey to beach & places for celebration.In this\
  \ trip I learned to ride a scooter.And I got a local best friend 29 years elder\
  \ than me & his mom whose place a destination for future journeys. In visits to\
  \ houses I saw many great people & in first impression itself I became their beloved.I\
  \ met one professor, with her guidance got a job in Greenpeace & got lots of book\
  \ from her.Saw places exclusively used by locals & unexplored by tourists.Stay with\
  \ local friend helped to know Goan food, culture, people & I got his old mom as\
  \ a nice granny we go for shopping together, bath the dogs .Being in happening like\
  \ celebrations, protests against  government.Through election, important like any\
  \ other place with which my direct involvement gave lots of information and experince.\
  \ Became a local & copied wonderful places & memories, getting lost and finding\
  \ way, unexpected meeting of my own people."
