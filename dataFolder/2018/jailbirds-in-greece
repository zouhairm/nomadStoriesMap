Text: "My best friend Shelley and I decided to head out to the small Greek island\
  \ of Kos in May 2010 for a working holiday. We knew we wanted to party and just\
  \ needed an easy job to sustain us for a few months. Wild Bull Bar. You can already\
  \ tell just by the name of the bar that things would get a little\_'cray cray'.\
  \ Basically, we had to lure revellers into the bar with offers of cheaper drinks\
  \ and a better party atmosphere than the other 20 or so bars along bar street. It\
  \ was a battlefield out there. Eyeballs were scratched and hair was pulled, metaphorically\
  \ speaking. \n\nShelley and I arrived at the beginning of May, which was the beginning\
  \ of the summer season, before the masses of European partygoers hit the island.\
  \ Before the battle of the bars really commenced. One evening, we were approached\
  \ by 4 men who asked us if we wanted to go for a drink, to which we obviously responded\
  \ that they could go to Wild Bull Bar and we would arrange cheap drinks for them.\
  \ Trap! They were undercover police, looking for new employees that were working\
  \ the summer season without a permit. \n\nIf you\u2019ve never experienced the flash\
  \ of a police badge on the inside of a jacket, well, you\u2019ve never lived! We\
  \ were subsequently marched off down the street, through the town square and into\
  \ the local cells.\n\nThe cells were in a square shape building surrounding an internal\
  \ courtyard. We were first taken to an office to be \u2018processed\u2019. As the\
  \ officer sat and worked on some paperwork, Shelley and I sat there looking around\
  \ the grubby little office wandering what was about to happen to us.\nAfter the\
  \ fingerprint formality was over, we were then ushered into the cell. It was a dark\
  \ room with high ceilings and a small window. There were no lights inside the cell,\
  \ the only light coming from the streetlights outside the window and the few lights\
  \ in the courtyard. Shelley and I huddled ourselves on the single mattress in the\
  \ corner of the cell and chatted for a while before falling asleep for a few hours.\
  \ Where were our employers? What were they doing to help us?\n\nBy the time 12 hours\
  \ locked up came around, there were officers at the cell door and we were escorted\
  \ to a \u2018courthouse\u2019. Our employers finally showed up and explained that\
  \ we needed to get 'pardoned' a judge. We were in and out within 5 minutes. No criminal\
  \ charges. Phew!\n\nFreedom. \n\nHere\u2019s the crazy part. A few weeks later,\
  \ we were back at work and the same officer that arrested us walked past, waved,\
  \ and came into the bar for a drink."
