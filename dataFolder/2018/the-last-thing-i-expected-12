Text: "The Last Thing I Expected\n\nOn December 31st 2016 me and my colleagues planed\
  \ a tour to Auli ski resort in Himalayas, in north Indian state Uttarakhand. We\
  \ started our journey on 30th from Haridwara. It was overnight journey for 10 hours.\
  \ We were travelling in Himalayan roads. The temperature was 4 below the freezing\
  \ point. It was very good travel. We saw some elephants, reindeers, foxes on the\
  \ way to Auli.\nWe reached the Auli village on 31st morning. And here our day started\
  \ going interesting. We didn\u2019t plan anything. And instead of looking for any\
  \ hotel we directly headed for resort, which is 12km from village. And we have to\
  \ go through deep forest of Himalayan mountain. After one hour of really dangerous\
  \ travelling we reached at the resort at 10am. We trek for 5 hours on Himalayan\
  \ ranges. It was the most beautiful view I ever seen. I first time saw the mountains\
  \ covered with snow and also enjoyed the snowfall.  \nMeanwhile we were enjoying\
  \ we forget about our plan for stay at night. We came down the mountain at 4pm.\
  \ By that time all the rooms of the resort were full. Now we had only way, to stay\
  \ in some hotel in village 12km downs the hill. And the 31st party was at the resort.\
  \ So we decided to go to village book a room and came back to Auli resort. \nThen\
  \ as per plan we booked our rooms in village and left for the party. It was great\
  \ party. After zero hours we started to look for our driver. After such a wonderful\
  \ day which was full of ups and downs, it happened, the last thing we expected,\
  \ we found our driver in drunk condition.  \nNow we were on the mountain in -12\
  \ degrees with no rooms and our driver was literally unconscious. None of us was\
  \ a good driver who can drive us down to village through such deep jungle and steep\
  \ mountain pass. We were searching for the place to sleep. The weather was getting\
  \ colder and we were standing on a road. It was 2am. We were searching for at least\
  \ one room but there were no sigh of help. Then suddenly out of nowhere some man\
  \ come. He looked like a priest from his clothes. He asked if anyone of us was drunk.\
  \ And thankfully no one of us was drunk. Then he said that there is one room in\
  \ the temple where you can stay. We all looked at a temple which was at the top\
  \ of the hill. And for the last thing I expected we got a room out of nowhere and\
  \ also when we all turned around there was no sign of priest there. But finally\
  \ we got a room. We thanked got and swear that none of us will drink throughout\
  \ 2017."
