Text: "It\u2019s 6pm. \nMy best friend and I are sitting at the terrace of a small\
  \ guest house in Tana\u2019s Ville Haute, overlooking the entire city. It\u2019\
  s getting chilly outside, and the wind is gently running through our hair. We\u2019\
  re quiet, very quiet. We\u2019re melting in the silence. \n\nThe sky is slowly dancing\
  \ back and forth between shades of dark blue and warm pink. The horizon is discreetly\
  \ welcoming tiny magical stars, and together, they\u2019re illuminating the capital\
  \ and the lives that find refuge in it. A few small windows turn yellow as the sun\
  \ starts fading away, bringing some light into the disappearing neighborhoods. In\
  \ other areas, little roadside fires start to burn. People gather around the flames\
  \ to cook, laugh, and drink some arranged rum out of recycled plastic water bottles.\
  \ \n\nOur THB beers are flowing into our throats, down to our hearts. And with every\
  \ sip, we let our souls indulge in their fuzziness, hoping their taste will stain\
  \ us with memories. \nWith every fresh inhale, we look up and let our chests succumb\
  \ to the immensity of the Tana skies. We breathe it all in. The harder and the louder\
  \ we breathe, the longer we make the moment last. \n\nBut eventually, the skies\
  \ have to get darker and colder. \nThe sun rays have to go.\nAnd we won\u2019t see\
  \ them rise again tomorrow. \nOur chests burn. \nWe\u2019ll be gone.\n\nThe sun\
  \ is finally asleep. \nThat\u2019s it. \nThe day is gone.\nTomorrow, we\u2019ll\
  \ be gone.\n\nAntananarivo is sparkling with love before us. \nOur eyes meet, and\
  \ sink into each other\u2019s salty tears. We\u2019re running after our breaths,\
  \ and as we try to catch them, we smile, and let shy chuckles sneak out. \n\nMadagascar.\
  \ \nYou were our local connection. All of you. Your soil, your rivers, your music,\
  \ your ocean. \nYour people, your people. \n\nPainting the picture of this last\
  \ sunset behind my shut eyelids overwhelms me.\nMy chest wall is cramped up. \n\
  Crying gives me headaches, \nBut here we go again. \n\nOur bare feet will keep on\
  \ walking through your roads. Our days will still be spent with your children. Our\
  \ nights with your music. \nAnd we\u2019ll keep on looking for the pieces of our\
  \ souls we\u2019ve left behind. \n\nMadagascar, you shook our lives. \nThank you\
  \ for taking us in with all of your generosity. Thank you for your kindness, and\
  \ for giving your all to us. Thank you for protecting us.\n\nI don\u2019t have the\
  \ words. Only the heart, and the love for you. \n\n\u201CA Vazaha Caramel\u201D"
