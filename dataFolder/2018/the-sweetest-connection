Text: "Two years ago, I've traveled to S\xE3o Tom\xE9 to meet my brother, who was\
  \ doing an humanitarian mission in Angola at the time. It was my first time travelling\
  \ to Africa, so I was beyond excited to not only meet my brother but to also get\
  \ in contact with a different country and culture.\nI instantly fell in love with\
  \ the island. From the paradisaical landscapes to the nicest people I have ever\
  \ met - they would proudly show us the island and explain the agriculture, the weather,\
  \ the culture, among other things - it was a journey that warmed my hearth and everyday\
  \ I feel myself missing that island. In Portuguese, we have have a word without\
  \ direct translation called Saudade, which is the feeling of longing for a place\
  \ where you were once happy, and that's how I feel about S\xE3o Tom\xE9.\nAs a shy\
  \ and anxious person, I was never good at dealing with people, especially around\
  \ children. I would often get awkward around them, not knowing what to say or do.\
  \ So, when a group of children happily approached me in S\xE3o Tom\xE9, I was paralyzed,\
  \ I didn't know what what I was supposed to do. They were staring at me with the\
  \ most beautiful smiles I've ever seen in my life, awaiting for a reaction from\
  \ my side.\nI took my hands to my pockets in a sign of awkwardness and I've found\
  \ some candy, that I had forgotten I had in there. I thought to myself \"Well, children\
  \ like candy, right? It's universal!\", so I took the candy from my pockets and\
  \ gave it to them.\nTheir eyes widened with joy as they grabbed the candy. They\
  \ ate it joyfully and gave me the warmest hugs - if I close my eyes, I can still\
  \ feel their little arms around my shoulders, and I feel happiness inside of me.\n\
  I've realized that often we don't need words to talk with someone, especially if\
  \ we're shy-  smiles and gestures that can tell so much more than words.\nAnd sometimes,\
  \ especially among children, candy can be the universal language of happiness."
