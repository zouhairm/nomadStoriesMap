Text: "I am still very young but I loved moving from place to place from even younger\
  \ age. I couldn't fly to another countries, so I decided to hitchhike in mine. Quite\
  \ often I needed to reach places and friends who were far away. That decision of\
  \ mine brought me lots of different experiences and close ups to the world. I had\
  \ a very nice chance to meet people who I wouldn't have a chance to meet never ever.\
  \ One time, when I was hitchhiking from Nida Art Colony back home to Kaunas, I met\
  \ German Professor from Oxford university who told me some great things which only\
  \ a great adult would tell to a younger one. I was greatly inspired and lighted\
  \ up to reach my dreamy goals. Other time I met Soviet Union fanatic who would tell\
  \ me all the way how my country would be ruined without stronger and more powerful\
  \ interfere from Russia. He himself had those big quinquennial plans to sober up\
  \ \"the weaker ones\". He thought he knew economics way better then any other grown\
  \ man. But somehow I could see that his bent down backbone and the energy he had\
  \ spread around viciously would not bring any good or optimistic for anyone who\
  \ would want to reach some better things. At these types of drivers I could only\
  \ be happy that somehow I learned to accept a man even if I don't agree. I just\
  \ understand that you see that what you have decided to see. You have what you chose\
  \ to have from all the great number of opportunities. \n    One great time I met\
  \ movie director. I always wanted to meet one and ask some questions. We were going\
  \ from Germany Hannover to Amsterdam. He was amazingly sharable man. He said that\
  \ he learned how to speak his mind just because he wanted very badly to be able\
  \ to tell his thoughts very clearly to some people. For better understanding and\
  \ connection. He was very much in love with his wife. You could feel it in the air\
  \ around him and from the way his eyes shone. When I was going from Holland to France\
  \ some great looking man was driving a car. I was sitting in a front seat with him.\
  \ He seemed as if he just jumped out from a very dreamy place. He was a pilot. He\
  \ looked like one a lot. Even holding car's wheel. We went very fast in a very straight\
  \ road. I felt so safe. Even I was so far from home not knowing were i will be next\
  \ and only hoping for the best.\n     There was some times the trip wasn't very\
  \ entertaining or lucky but after every trip, bad or good, I felt much richer. Much\
  \ more able to give something back to the world. Something of a good quality and\
  \ energy."
