Text: "Much has been written about New Zealand\u2019s landscape; its black sand beaches,\
  \ exotic fauna and glaciers, all are recurring themes in online forums and travel\
  \ media. In contrast, testimonies about the effects that its cities can exert on\
  \ visitors are considerably scarcer. In view of this situation, I would like to\
  \ share with the reader the results of a fl\xE2nerie experiment I conducted in Auckland\
  \ several weeks ago. \n\nTaking Huntley Avenue as a starting point, my goal was\
  \ to walk the city without a fixed direction until finding something interesting\
  \ to do. Since the sun was particularly scorching that day, I decided to follow\
  \ the tree line that as I would soon discover, leads first to Carlton Road and then\
  \ to Park Avenue. Along this stretch, boats hooked to the back of cars, wood fences\
  \ and houses entirely covered with vines, succeeded each other in an endless and\
  \ quasi-poetic fashion. I kept wandering in this direction until I suddenly found\
  \ myself in Karangahape Road where I encounter a wide variety of coffee shops, bars\
  \ and boutiques, not to mention a couple of strip clubs that highlighted the red\
  \ past of the area. \n\nAs any person would have done, I gave myself a break and\
  \ looked for a place to enjoy a cold beer. I stepped into Verona Bar and I started\
  \ to talk with the bartender who just as me, turned out to be a huge fan of hip-hop\
  \ music. \u2013If you don\u2019t dance it you don\u2019t get it- he claimed at some\
  \ point, and then he told me about a place on Queen Street where I could go and\
  \ try if I wanted to. For the sake of my experiment, I finished my beer and went\
  \ straight to the Victory Performance Center where I signed in for Kristle Tan\u2019\
  s class. Although my lack of experience (clumsiness) came out in all its splendour\
  \ during the warm up, I eventually managed to keep up with the groove and by the\
  \ end of the session; I was able to decently execute most of the moves. \n\nThanks\
  \ to this experience, I realized not only that I am not the worst dancer ever, but\
  \ also that traveling is not about discovering what is out there, but about discovering\
  \ yourself through what is out there. Since that day almost three months ago, Tuesday\
  \ afternoons have become hip-hop afternoons and I can assure you, that all this\
  \ practice is paying off (at least in terms of fun). I conclude this note with an\
  \ advice for the reader; on your next trip, get out on the streets and get lost...seeking\
  \ your way back you might end up finding yourself."
