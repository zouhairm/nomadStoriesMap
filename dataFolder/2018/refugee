Text: "\u201CI don't regret coming here.\u201D, he said with a tired content over\
  \ his freckled face. The October sun was just starting to hide behind the silhouettes\
  \ of the archaic Fort William. \n\n\"I taught at a Madrassa back there, we were\
  \ a family of five.\"\n\"Only three of us came here.\"\nImran's words had no regret,\
  \ only reminisce. He was my ride today.\n\nIndia and the Aussies were locking horns\
  \ at Eden Gardens, not too far from here. The hustle bustle of the Maidan was subdued\
  \ and the dusk over the Hooghly didn\u2019t throw its customary scarlet hues over\
  \ the water, instead it was an upsetting grey. I sat mulling over my impending departure\
  \ the day after while the fragrant night jasmines argued otherwise.\n\n\u201CWhere\
  \ will you travel next?\u201D\n\n\u201CI actually haven\u2019t decided yet.\u201D\
  , a little unsure if I had seen all of Bengal.\n\n\u201CLet your heart take you\
  \ places before your mind reasons it.\u201D\n\nThis was coming from a man who had\
  \ seen the blood of his kin, his ancestry torn apart and forced to leave his soil.\
  \ 1971 saw the death of three million and ten million migrated from Bangladesh into\
  \ Bengal. Freedom came at a price.\n\n\u201CI might have been well off there but\
  \ I chose this instead.\u201D, he said as the evening Azaan seeped through the silence\
  \ of the riverbank.\n\n\u201CI had a friend back there, Ashutosh. He ensured the\
  \ safety of my family by surrendering his. I wasn't nice to him, that I regret.\
  \ If it weren\u2019t for him, we\u2019d\u2026\"\n\n\"I named my first born after\
  \ him.\"\n\n\u201CTimes have changed. People don\u2019t see us as they used to.\
  \ I used to make Hindu idols before taking up driving, made merry during Durga Puja,\
  \ we all did. Well, except the clergy, of course.\u201D, he chuckled.\n\nI found\
  \ myself looking away into the distance. Sensing my unease, he stopped midway.\n\
  I could see the trawler boats returning home, young men in subdued mien, idling\
  \ on the rooftops, bonding over tobacco.\n\n\u201CDid you ever go back?\u201D.\n\
  \n\u201CI should have.\u201D, he said feeling for the talisman tied to his arm,\
  \ under his shirt.\n\n\u201CAmmi made me wear this everyday before Namaaz.\u201D\
  , Imran said with a childlike grin.\n\nWe could now see lights beginning to twinkle\
  \ on the other side of the river while women, draped in saris paid their respects\
  \ to the holy water and the setting sun, in gratitude for today's good fortune and\
  \ in humble acceptance of what the river gods would bestow on them tomorrow. The\
  \ mosque at the other end of the Maidan was now barely visible in the fading light\
  \ as the empty tram rumbled through its lawns, disturbing the lovers underneath\
  \ the trees."
