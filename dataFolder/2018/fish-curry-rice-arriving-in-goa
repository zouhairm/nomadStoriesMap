Text: "\u201CAhhh Goa, it is like a kiss on the lips,\u201D sighed the chai wallah\
  \ in the parking lot. He passed me the spiced tea in a dusty paper cup. Squinting\
  \ in the bright sunlight, I sipped my tea and headed for a lounge chair in the sand,\
  \ hoping the saline breeze would rejuvenate me.\n\nI laid back and surveyed the\
  \ scenery. After two weeks in the desert, I welcomed the sights and sounds of the\
  \ sea. I let the warmth soak in. Tourists and locals alike were leisurely strolling\
  \ along the coastline, but the tourists wore much less than the Indians. I watched\
  \ as Indian men gawked at bikini-clad Russians lazing on the sand. And then a hefty\
  \ cow came sauntering up to take a sunbath near my chair: yes, I am still in India.\n\
  \ \nGoa differs from Northern India in many ways. First, and always foremost in\
  \ my book: the food. Rather than the chapati and roti of the North, Goans eat rice.\
  \ Emerald paddies line the roads, safe havens for elegant white herons. The local\
  \ rice is bathed in a liquidy orange curry, pungent from garlic and chilies, sweet\
  \ from tamarind and coconut. Fish is the main event, plucked fresh from the sea.\
  \ Sardines, kingfish, mackerel\u2026 they all get dipped in cornmeal and fried,\
  \ whole, into crispy, salty filets.\n \nSecond difference: coconuts! Almost everything\
  \ here is made from parts of the ubiquitous tree. The women rub jasmine-scented\
  \ coconut oil into their dark, thick hair. Coconut shells make convenient bowls\
  \ and their coarse outer fibers are wound into ropes. Besides the yummy curry and\
  \ a sweet-sour vinegar called toddy, coconut is found in innumerable baked goods.\
  \ There are coconut tarts, cakes, custards, toffee\u2026 and my favorite: tender\
  \ coconut ice cream.\n \nHere in Goa, Catholics make up 30% of the population, as\
  \ opposed to the 3% minority they maintain in India as a whole. It\u2019s a legacy\
  \ from the Portuguese, who colonized Goa in the 16th century. But Goans bring that\
  \ Indian spice to Christianity. They carry colorful icons of Jesus, Mary, and the\
  \ saints. They adorn miraculous crosses with marigold garlands. And they begin day-long\
  \ feasts at five in the morning, brass band a-blaring and firecrackers exploding\
  \ right below my window.\n \nBut Goa is delightful, probably because it\u2019s eighty\
  \ degrees and sunny every day. Or is it because Goans embrace both afternoon siesta\
  \ and afternoon tea? Maybe it\u2019s the close proximity to both beachy goodness\
  \ and hilltop Hanuman temples. But, I bet it\u2019s the tender coconut ice cream.\
  \ Oh, yes. It\u2019s definitely the tender coconut ice cream."
