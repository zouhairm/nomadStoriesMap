Text: "Two things in the nature that leaves me spell bound are the mountains and the\
  \ moon. So, recently when I had the chance to bask in the moonlight in the lap of\
  \ the mountains, it took me a while to come out of its hangover. It was an impromptu\
  \ decision of me and my friends to travel to a place called  \u2018Gevhande Apti\u2019\
  , a small village approximately 130 km far from Mumbai. The road to this small village\
  \ is in itself an amazing ride. The perfectly sculpted roads against the backdrop\
  \ of picturesque mountains are a vision to behold. When the highway finished, we\
  \ took a \u2018kutcha\u2019 (mud)road which led to the village. The passage had\
  \ steep turnings and it seemed one hell of a roller coaster ride. But when I reached\
  \ the destination, it was definitely worth the ride. It was evening and the sun\
  \ was about to set when we reached there. A resort which was half built and half\
  \ under construction was the place we had come to. There were different tent like\
  \ accommodation for the guests. One of my friend\u2019s father was building that\
  \ resort, hence the privilege to visit there free of cost. The location was ethereal.\
  \ It was surrounded by mountains all around which exuded magnificence and mystery\
  \ at the same time. We strolled around the resort for some time and breathed in\
  \ the fresh air that smelled of greenery and it was bliss. In no time the daylight\
  \ was gone and the moon shone at its brightest in the sky. Although, my friends\
  \ were planning to have a bonfire in the night, I decided to skip it and walked\
  \ out from there. I walked for a while and found a small hut. A small amount of\
  \ light was coming from the hut. I went to the doorstep and decided to knock. The\
  \ thrill of the uncertainty is amazing. An old man opened the door and enquired\
  \ as to who I was and what did I need. I told him that I was visiting a nearby resort\
  \ and was just walking around. He openly welcomed me in his home. He lived with\
  \ his wife and they had barely any necessities at home but they insisted that I\
  \ have dinner with them and stay the night with them. His wife made \u2018rotis\u2019\
  \ and \u2018okra curry\u2019 which was delicious. I was bowled over by their hospitality\
  \ and warmth. They shared a lot of details about their lives with a childlike enthusiasm.\
  \ As they had no children, they thanked me for staying over at their home and let\
  \ them take care of me like a child. Although it was quite cold  I decided to sleep\
  \ in their backyard gazing at the mountains in the moonlight and pondering over\
  \ the different facets of life."
