Text: "\u201CDon\u2019t you get caught out by nightfall now!\u201D Mountain Lake drives\
  \ away in a cloud of dust, fishing lines swirling out the back of his pickup truck.\
  \ He\u2019d picked me up on the cracked asphalt road that meanders along the ample\
  \ curves of the Rio Grande. Arid campsites, unused for many months, hugged the bottom\
  \ of the cliff that seemed to tumble down from the sky high above. Mountain Lake\
  \ didn\u2019t feel like driving me to Taos Pueblo \u2013 today was a day for fishing.\
  \ \u201CThe Pueblo brings me bad luck\u201D, he says.\n\nThis is New Mexico, the\
  \ high desert, in the dead of winter. Prickly cactuses grow in the shade of evergreen\
  \ firs. The sun is everything: big and white and raging until it bows behind the\
  \ mountaintops, in slanting layers of pink and purple. While it\u2019s gone, temperatures\
  \ drop to freezing. Some native Americans believe that their prayers help the sun\
  \ cross the sky every day.\n\nI hiked away from the bed of the Rio Grande and out\
  \ of the gorge, through a craggy path of burnt clay. The top of the mesa was grassy\
  \ and shimmering in the wind like a Mississippi prairie. In the distance, I could\
  \ see the adobe walls of Taos Pueblo, the oldest settlement in North America. I\
  \ headed for it with the sun already reaching for the mountain range.\n\nCrossing\
  \ the American wilderness without a car or a phone brings some atavistic cosmologies\
  \ up to date: the sun is your clock and karma is your money.\n\nThere was a stream\
  \ I couldn\u2019t cross. I followed its uneven bank, looking for a bridge or a dam.\
  \ I reached out for a floating log and slipped into the water up to my hips. The\
  \ cold and dark night was coming on fast. In the stories of Jack London, this is\
  \ often when a riotously alive character realizes he is facing death.\n\nPanic made\
  \ it hard to swallow. I ran towards the river, and back towards the sun. I ran until\
  \ I became the exhausted shadow of my rational self and threw myself in the mossy\
  \ grass. There I watched the sunset. Colors were unforgivingly crisp, blues and\
  \ reds of petulant perfection, out of reach. As the glorious final rays wove finger-of-god\
  \ filaments across the horizon, a tuba started playing, followed by the distant\
  \ twitter of a violin.\n\nIt was Mountain Lake riding his truck over the shrubs\
  \ and stones, slamming the horn and yelling out of the window. While we were in\
  \ the car, he said: \u2018you know, in this country, Native Americans live in reservations.\
  \ These are natural history museums that tourists come to spoil. If you want to\
  \ meet some, stay on the country roads\u2019."
