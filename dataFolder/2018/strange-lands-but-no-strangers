Text: "I was smiling, the hot Sri Lankan sun beating down on my back as I walked along\
  \ the winding dirt path through the jungle. I was worried I would not find the correct\
  \ house, but I rounded the clump of trees and there it was. The house sat among\
  \ a messy sprout of weeds; patches of dirt serving as a front yard. I gazed upon\
  \ the broken brick structure with a bound log roof and was sure I was in the right\
  \ place. The path to the house curved past a half-built well. In the back, I could\
  \ see the small pen that had been built for the new mother dog to nurse her still-blind\
  \ puppies. \n\nMy relief at finding the right house was short lived. My Sinhala\
  \ was, at best, the level of a one-year-old. How was I going to communicate I was\
  \ there to see Jaja? Taking a deep breath, I walked up to the open hole in the wall\
  \ that served as a doorway. I peeked cautiously into the dark, cool room. There\
  \ was no electricity and no lights, yet somehow the temperature in the brightly\
  \ painted room felt a heavenly 20 degrees cooler than the blistering 95 outside.\
  \ \n\nAn elderly man sat in the corner, his head resting on his bare chest. He did\
  \ not look up. I shuffled my feet awkwardly and cleared my throat in an effort to\
  \ get his attention. There was still no movement. I had to just go for it.\n\u201C\
  Kohomodo\u201D I said.\nHe looked up. \nI was lost.\nThat was all I had. I didn\u2019\
  t know how to say, \u201CExcuse me sir, but I met your very sweet 8 year old granddaughter\
  \ on the dirt path yesterday. She invited me over for tea and told me we were now\
  \ best friends and asked me to visit her today after her school ended. Could you\
  \ please let her know I\u2019m here?\u201D \nAs I stood there, floundering in this\
  \ stranger\u2019s doorway, he smiled at me and gestured to the chair next to him.\
  \ I nodded and smiled back weakly as I slipped my shoes off and came inside. \n\
  I sat down and smiled back at him. \u201CJaja?\u201D I asked. \nHe simply smiled\
  \ more, nodded, and put his head back down. I waited for a moment, then relaxed\
  \ into the chair. Somehow I was completely comfortable. Sitting next to this strange\
  \ man, in a country where I did not speak the language, in a worn brick house, waiting\
  \ for an 8 year old girl to come and smile at me and be my best friend."
