Text: "Tuesday night. 2pm. Screaming wind in front of my small, rattling bedroom window.\
  \ I\xB4m sweating, turning and tossing around in some feverish dreams. Suddenly\
  \ my boyfriend grabs my arm and wakes me up. Apparently I kept talking in my sleep.\
  \ It\xB4s the night before one of the biggest adventures of my life, on my own,\
  \ at the other end of the world. And I\xB4m lying here, my head is steaming hot\
  \ and I\xB4m sure you could fry a perfectly fine egg on it. Seems like my body took\
  \ the idea of holiday fever pretty damn serious. Hard night, but I need to finish\
  \ stuffing all my essentials in my adventurous looking backpack. I cannot refrain\
  \ from crying and shedding not only one tear while leaving my loved ones behind,\
  \ but I know I\xB4m walking in the right direction for now. After flying for ages,\
  \ sitting jammed between two massive men and running through concourses all over\
  \ the world, I finally arrive where I wanted to: Cape Town, South Africa, the mother\
  \ of cities, the Rainbow Nation. I immediately notice the azure blue sky and the\
  \ spotlight looking sun. I got so used to the german cadaver-grey sky, dying plants\
  \ and cold nights the last few weeks that the sun hurting in my narrow eyes is the\
  \ best feeling ever and I forget all the exertions on the spot. Steamrolled by all\
  \ the unforgettable impressions, I arrive at my new home for the next few months\
  \ and get to know those people, I never thought I could become so close with. 2\
  \ months later, 28 degrees, a mild summer evening in \xD3bz, one of the Vibrant\
  \ parts of the city. I\xB4m drinking a Castle Lager, life\xB4s great. Were about\
  \ to go on a sunset hike on the famous Lion\xB4s Head, after we were so amazed by\
  \ the stunning sunrise we watched from up there weeks ago. It was my first weekend\
  \ and I just jumped in at the deep end and joined these back then strangers at 4\
  \ o\xB4clock in the morning. The way up is very difficult, especially with a torch\
  \ between your teeth climbing up a cold, shaking ladder. On your left is what seems\
  \ to be a yawning abyss, but you can just guess because you\xB4re trying to fight\
  \ your way through the thick, black darkness, trying not to end your time here already.\
  \ But the feeling on the top is the reason why you do all that to yourself. I felt\
  \ like I wanted to scream my head off, if my lungs weren\xB4t on fire. As I saw\
  \ all the billions of lights down there, I understood. The sun rose and so did I.\
  \ So now I\xB4m sitting up there, the sun ready to kiss the ocean goodbye. You ever\
  \ left home and gone home at the same time? I did."
