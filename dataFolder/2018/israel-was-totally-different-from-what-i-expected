Text: "My first trip to Israel was made with some excitement and a lot of trepidation.\
  \  The news outlets here have made a big deal of the danger of Israel so I thought\
  \ I was probably taking my life in my hands by going.  When we arrived, we were\
  \ met by a guide who took us around Israel and I never felt scared once.  For being\
  \ such a small country, Israel has a lot of variety.  The place we stayed in at\
  \ first was beautiful with swimming, great food, and beautiful accommodations. \
  \ The second place was in Jerusalem and we were near a wonderful park.  We walked\
  \ in the park and enjoyed the differences in how the park was set up compared to\
  \ how our parks are in the U.S..  We learned some of Israels history through informative\
  \ displays on one side of the park.  There were different levels of land and beautiful\
  \ walkways, with verandahs, waterfalls, and different areas to see and enjoy.  In\
  \ one area there were many soldiers.  They ate lunch, hung out there, and made me\
  \ feel very safe.  As a matter of fact they were everywhere!  We went to the temple\
  \ and walked the streets, saw the Pool of Bethesda, prayed at the Wall, and never\
  \ felt one ounce of fear.  How could we when the soldiers were everywhere and you\
  \ knew that they would take care of things.  We talked with them and learned about\
  \ the different clothing they wore.  We learned that some Israelites were exempt\
  \ from service.  We learned there were Palestinians who loved Israel and lived in\
  \ harmony with them.  Israel was very different from what \nI expected it to be.\
  \  It was truly unique and beautiful."
