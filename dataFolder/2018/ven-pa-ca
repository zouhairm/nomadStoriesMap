  \ \n\nFloating down the Napo River on a River Rat that summer, this frequently uttered\
  \ phrase was moments from gaining its momentum as a warm invitation into the artesano\
  \ community. Maxi, a travel rat from Argentina, came organically flowing alongside\
  \ me in what would become a confluence of yet unborn connections. \n\nHe was staying\
  \ with Liz, a young, local crafts-gal from the small town of Mondana, with a familiar\
  \ appetite for art and travel. I knocked on the door of Liz\u2019s mother\u2019\
  s home like a small playpal asking if Maxi could come out and play. He couldn\u2019\
  t at the moment but she reassured us he would be at the lodge for dinner. \n\nHe\
  \ was, and so was Liz. With a childlike timidity she uncovered her handcrafted macrame\
  \ and simultaneously undammed a streaming river of vitality and play. We spent the\
  \ entire evening sitting at the long dinner table at the lodge meditatively weaving\
  \ intricate knots as we got to discussing our almost complementary upbringings.\
  \ I was the daughter of an Ecuadorean immigrant woman, raised in Los Angeles among\
  \ city lights and subway rats. She was an Ecuadorean girl growing up amid the Amazonian\
  \ starlight and River Rats. \n\nMy mind and wonder breathlessly expanded as we spent\
  \ the sticky evening covered in mosquito bites crafting a long awaited friendship.\
  \ This seemingly elementary pastime would aid a most fluid connection to the local\
  \ artesano community in every small town and vast city I later traveled through\
  \ in South America. \n\nLiz had shown me the ropes of easy encounter and the elaborate\
  \ knots that came with them. \u201CVen pa ca\u201D was no longer a triggering signal\
  \ of warning from an unkempt stranger sitting on a curb tying string. The words\
  \ had been washed of the fear and tension of an American woman traveling alone.\
  \ The string of words had transformed into a warm and familiar greeting from a brother\
  \ of the craft. I naturally found a swift network that transformed my experience\
  \ from cautious consumer of culture to participating producer of local craft. A\
  \ facile set of knots had become a catalyst of meeting and movement."
