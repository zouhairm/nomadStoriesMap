Text: "\"You will meet an Englishman in Vietnam\", my Italian fortune-teller housemate\
  \ outlines her sixth-sense prediction whilst observing me packing for my first ever\
  \ cycling trip.\nShe must be jokingly mad, I have eight senses, after all.\n\"Who?\
  \ An Englishman in New York, perhaps?\", I think out loud.\nA pink butterfly covered\
  \ passport, two ready steady credit and debit cards, my wardrobe dump, eager for\
  \ a spring clean after the 12-day remote pedalling, granny's knickers collection.\
  \ Packed. Who will I meet on such a wild adventure? Just like minded people.\nRemote\
  \ Vietnam and Laos by bike. 676-km. 10,353m total ascent. Precision or prediction?\
  \ I am obsessed by both now.\nChurch Boutique Hotel Hang Gai, Hanoi, December 20th,\
  \ 2015.\nMy skinny legs, covered in a long black skirt, out of my luxurious travel\
  \ wardrobe, are following my feet down the stairs towards the hotel reception, a\
  \ meeting place for an introductory dinner for all world-wide participants of the\
  \ upcoming adventure. Step by step, sense by sense, I admire the power of my seven\
  \ wonders of the world: I hear a loud masculine voice, I smell a strong male perfume,\
  \ I feel my heart beating as soon as I see a man, screening me from my top to the\
  \ bottom, as if I am walking on a podium in Paris. Taste and love, two wonders of\
  \ my world are left to be discovered, uncovered and covered.\nI close my eyes, take\
  \ a deep breath in, exhale and open the windows of my soul to taste the power of\
  \ love. \nMy dinner plate is covered with freshly crafted flowers from colourful\
  \ vegetables and juicy fruits. Fields of rice, corn, cassava and sugarcane speak\
  \ their beauty whilst an Englishman pedals beside me. I am lost in the moment of\
  \ faith.\nI take my first happy feet capture at the swimming pool at Mai Chau Eco\
  \ Lodge, he is in the first frame. I wear my favourite gypsy pants, blue top and\
  \ matchy-matchy flip-flops, he nominates me for the best dinner outfit asking a\
  \ local waitress to vote. I change into my special-occasion black and white dress\
  \ for a traditional dance night with the locals, he cannot take his windows off\
  \ my soul. We kiss the honey over the moon on the stairs, admire the starry sky\
  \ whilst we talk to infinity and beyond, lost in time, space and translation. \n\
  I wake up on a Jesus's birthday surrounded by a strange human warmth. I swim in\
  \ those beautiful blue eyes asking me whether this can continue tonight, again.\n\
  Who has ever expected to meet an Englishman in Vietnam? Prediction, I believe in\
  \ Christmas miracles though."
