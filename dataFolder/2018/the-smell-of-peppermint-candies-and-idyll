Text: "The moment I entered the old little town, I felt it in my guts \u2013 it was\
  \ like a fairy place spreading out beauty, peace and delicate sweetness. I suppose\
  \ this should be the sensation of a person entering into paradise.\nFascinating\
  \ lake landscapes are so common for Swedish nature. They often go along with stunning\
  \ mountain views but rarely with the addition of smiley candy bakeries and picturesque\
  \ homes. There comes Gr\xE4nna, on one side sitting at the shores of the vast V\xE4\
  ttern Lake, contemplating at crystal waters, and on the other side, nestled just\
  \ at the foot of a steep mountain. \nI walked silently through the cobbles streets\
  \ while my attention was fully captivated by the colorfully-painted wooden houses.\
  \ Light shades of yellow, red and brown were dominating in a tender but vivid mood.\
  \ Every house had its blooming rose garden. I moved my eyes towards the calm lake\
  \ and on the horizon, near to the coast, they met a majestic castle. \u201CThis\
  \ town is, for sure, a pearl of graceful architectural imagination\u201D, I thought.\
  \ For such a short walk-around it had already evoked that sense of idyll, otherwise\
  \ hard to find, because of a smooth combination of natural bless and human efforts.\n\
  I was breathing the sharply pure air, so typical for mountain surroundings, but\
  \ there was a sweet hint in the smell. On the main street, plenty of charming bakeries\
  \ were making the local candy sticks. Visitors like me were offered to watch the\
  \ production. In the tiny kitchen, a handy young man was crafting the marvel taste\
  \ of the red and white candy called \u201Cpolkagris\u201D. He boiled a mixture of\
  \ sugar, water and strong vinegar. Then, skillfully split it on a marble table,\
  \ put peppermint flavors and started kneading the dough. Admirable, he actually\
  \ played with the dough, twisting it for more than half an hour and at the end forming\
  \ long and thin sticks. The recipe of polkagris delicacy had been created in Gr\xE4\
  nna in the middle of 19th century by a poor young widow who kept it as a secret\
  \ until her death. In the bakery shop, candy-shaped booklets were telling the story.\n\
  I went back on the street with freshly-baked artisan polkagris in my hand and breathed\
  \ deeply again. Now the sweet smell of peppermint was transformed from a hint to\
  \ an intense feeling. It was the kind of feeling of an authentic connection with\
  \ the most popular local tradition and the quiet beauty of that mesmerizing place."
