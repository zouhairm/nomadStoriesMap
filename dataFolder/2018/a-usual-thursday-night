  \ and I smile between us and pay for our drinks: a latte with Bailey\u2019s for\
  \ me, and two pots of rose tea. We take our usual positions in the sunken living\
  \ area; dark haired Jess with me on the couch, and sandy haired Imogen in the armchair\
  \ across the low, pale wood coffee table from us.\n Despite being a fair bit away\
  \ from my native Florida -- not to mention my friends, family and fiance -- London\u2019\
  s Royal Borough of Kingston had come to feel like home. Thanks especially to the\
  \ two girls I was sitting with -- so, maybe our residence hall\u2019s compulsory\
  \ welcome event wasn\u2019t such an imposition after all.\n Imogen and I quickly\
  \ get to our usual bought of friendly flirting, and Jess gets to her usual bought\
  \ of rolling her eyes at us, while we wait for our drinks. Another staff member\
  \ comes around the corner and places the two single serve pots of tea in front of\
  \ the girls, as the barista pokes his head around the corner, holding a piece of\
  \ the espresso machine, \u201CIt\u2019s going to be a bit on the latte, I apologize.\u201D\
  \n I suppress snickers, \u201CThat\u2019s fine.Take your time.\u201D\n The Wags\
  \ N Tales coffee bar in Surbiton, just before Brighton Road turns to Upper Brighton,\
  \ had become our favorite place to enjoy a drink and recap our weeks. The quiet\
  \ music encourages conversation, while the light wood decor makes the place feel\
  \ homey in London\u2019s sea of modern style buildings. The floor to ceiling front\
  \ windows give an amazing people watching view of the sidewalk outside.\n \u201C\
  Sorry about the wait,\u201D the barista apologizes once again, setting the almost\
  \ too full mug in front of me.\n \u201CIt\u2019s fine,\u201D I laugh, \u201Cthank\
  \ you.\u201D\n I stir down the foam and dusting of cocoa powder on top, and listen\
  \ to Jess and Imogen cooing over the dogs sitting peaceably under the tables of\
  \ their owners. Frankly, the best part of the cafe was its dog friendly policy;\
  \ it brightened our dorm imposed petless existence. \n I blow the heat from the\
  \ drink and sip; the warmth of the coffee embracing the nip of the alcohol. The\
  \ hot beverage and companionship banish the British chill. I notice Imogen begin\
  \ to pick her phone up and place it back on the table face down. \nMy mug empty,\
  \ I smirk, \u201CAre you checking your phone to see if you\u2019ve been out long\
  \ enough to go home?\u201D\n \u201CNo...,\u201D but we know better and begin to\
  \ gather our things anyway.\n The barista bids us farewell as we head out, and we\
  \ wave back, \u201CSee you next week.\u201D"
