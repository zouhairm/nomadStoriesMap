Text: "I travel to find some of the most authentic small businesses that thrive locally\
  \ but are almost invisible globally. They share their stories with me to spread\
  \ the best attitude, inspiration and business tactics online and in magazines internationally.\
  \ Those guys are the ones who are holding our economy and will be there when corporations\
  \ will see their decline.\n\nSo this month I head to Copenhagen, a city that knew\
  \ little wars, in a country that has the oldest uninterrupted monarchy in the World.\
  \ Copenhageners are proud to buy locally, support small Danish craftsmen and designers.\
  \ One of which is Dahlman's saddlery. This is the oldest existing saddlery in Denmark\
  \ which has been working with the royal stables. Here's what Monocle Magazine said\
  \ after visiting them in May 2007:\n\n\"As offers from superstar architects flood\
  \ in, the brothers are adamant they won\u2019t expand. \u201CWe don\u2019t have\
  \ the time or resources to train new employees \u2013 so, by the time we retire,\
  \ there will be no one to take over.\u201D Head to Copenhagen and buy into two centuries\
  \ of history while you still can. The brothers will be waiting, but for how long?\"\
  \n\n10 years after that article was published I headed to Dahlman's workshop. From\
  \ the street I saw a time-worn sign and a mess inside. Right in the window there\
  \ was a working table with many leather cuts scattered and a young man working.\
  \ He was deliberately cutting and developing the belt. I was afraid the business\
  \ was already closed and the last work is being done right now. Dahlman founded\
  \ this workshop in 1807 and now I might be one of the last people seeing it working.\
  \ I started recalling the story of this place, which started during Napoleonic wars.\
  \ Then Napoleon was threatening to invade Denmark and English allies where afraid\
  \ that he will capture large Danish fleet. Soon Copenhageners where surprised to\
  \ see how English armada was destroying all Danish ships. Back then saddle shops\
  \ where located near the port and the young Dahlman saw that after strike none of\
  \ them survived. So he started his shop here.\n\nSo I entered the shop and asked\
  \ the young man about Eric and Frank Hendriksen, two brothers that run this business\
  \ from 1959. \u201CThey are well into their 70s and already retired. I\u2019m a\
  \ one of the new owners actually. Sorry for the mess, we are making a renovation\
  \ here\u201D - said Jeppe Dencker. Now Dencker is relaunching the shop into the\
  \ 21 century and he will share his plans with me."
