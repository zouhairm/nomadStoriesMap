Text: "\u201CLife is short\u201D- I suppose it\u2019s cliche\u2019, but so true. After\
  \ losing our oldest son at a young age, my husband and I learned this lesson early\
  \ on. We have never let anything get in the way of living each day with our children\
  \ as if it could be our last. \nFinances aren\u2019t always stable for young families\
  \ and vacations are not necessarily a priority for some, but we have made it at\
  \ point to enjoy the world with our children- even if it is on a budget. \nMy favorite\
  \ adventure was chosen with a 6 day time frame over Easter in 2014. We had saved\
  \ our change as we always do in a piggy bank and had accumulated $300 in change.\
  \ We had an additional $400 to spend. 6 days, $700, family of 4. Our wish? To camp\
  \ on the ocean. \nWe chose Holly Beach Louisiana because it was one of the few places\
  \ you could drive on the beach and camp. We drove straight through from Wisconsin,\
  \ stopping for baths in Hot Springs, Arkansas. There, we indulged in an old style\
  \ mineral bath with a personal bath attendant at the Arlington Hotel. We continued\
  \ on to our destination and made it to Holly Beach after about 20 hours on the road.\
  \ \nWe set up a bed in the back of our SUV for the children and pitched a tent for\
  \ us. We set our alarms to high tide so we were awake to make sure we weren\u2019\
  t washed away, as our camp was right on the beach! \nThose 2 evenings on the beach\
  \ were truly magical. The first night there was a full moon and Holly Beach is a\
  \ pretty quiet place in April so the light of the moon and our campfire on the beach\
  \ was the only light we had. \nOur children saw illuminescent plankton for the first\
  \ time that night. My daughters eyes lit up when she saw the glowing ocean and had\
  \ no idea that there was sea life out there that could put on such a light show!\n\
  The next day we ventured to nearby Cameron Louisiana. It was Easter Day and I was\
  \ feeling like a bad mother for not doing a traditional Easter celebration for my\
  \ children. As we were eating at a restaurant, some locals walked up to us and invited\
  \ our children to an egg hunt at the local baptist church. \nOur time was limited\
  \ and we had to get back on the road to Wisconsin. I remember stopping at Taco Bell\
  \ and giggling with my husband and children that we were having taco supremes for\
  \ Easter dinner. \nIt\u2019s the simple pleasures that I enjoy so much. Travel doesn\u2019\
  t need to cost much and it doesn\u2019t have to be a big fancy planned vacation\
  \ to be the best adventure of your life. I certainly never expected this joy to\
  \ be found in Louisiana."
