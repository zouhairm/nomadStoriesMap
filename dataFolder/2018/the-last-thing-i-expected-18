Text: "It is an early summer morning, I am cycling on a bumpy road in the Great Hungarian\
  \ Plain and everything I knew is put into a question. I thought it was an obvious\
  \ next step to become a researcher and academician and to do that away from places\
  \ known to me.\n Since I was little I could spend hours hypnotizing maps and geography\
  \ books learning about different lives and places both near and far. For a long\
  \ time, like many others around me, I thought that during these hours I was paving\
  \ my path to the hallways and rooms of the universities. I never thought it could\
  \ be something else: a story of a little boy not finding words and sufficient answers\
  \ for the scenes in the aftermath of Soviet Union; a story of finding a ticket to\
  \ expand and escape the little world accessible to me; or maybe a long story of\
  \ running into a girl from the other side of the globe. Back then I just moved from\
  \ one book to another, from one map to another. I just wanted to see, I just wanted\
  \ to know, I just couldn\u2019t without it.\n Today, the road in front of me is\
  \ empty, there are only fields of yellow and green both left and right and a glimpse\
  \ of a church tower in the distance. If I hurry up, I can make it to the Sunday\
  \ mass and find my place among the old heads somewhere in the sparsely filled rows.\
  \ There is no reason for me to be here. I have done my interviews, I have done my\
  \ fieldwork and the families and people I have talked to are far away from where\
  \ I am.  It will take some time before I reach the next town where a train could\
  \ take me back to where I started. \n I hear nothing but the squeaking of my bicycle\
  \ as I move forward with the speed of a turtle. And as I pedal I don\u2019t know\
  \ what is about to happen. I don\u2019t know yet, that in winter I will throw away\
  \ my thesis at a point it is ready for submission and I will move to a new place\
  \ to start a new life from the scratch. A life in which I am free to wander and\
  \ the words of others don\u2019t pave my path. While on the road I know nothing.\
  \ I just want to move, I just want to know, I just can\u2019t without it."
