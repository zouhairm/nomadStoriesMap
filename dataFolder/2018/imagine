Text: "Making our way through Central park, we are watching marathon runners. This\
  \ Saturday morning they chase their win to volunteers\u2019 cheers. Our feet touch\
  \ the edge of a gray-white circle with the word \u2018Imagine\u2019 in the centre.\
  \ It is so silent in here. As if noisy spirit of the city gave up in collision with\
  \ the spirit of worship dwelling in here. My friend and I look at each other; we\
  \ feel uneasy to make photos or even talk. I sit down on the ground and look at\
  \ the letters on the ground. I put my arms around my backpack, some impulse inside\
  \ makes me open my mouth, out are pouring the lines: \nImagine there's no heaven,\
  \ \nIt's easy if you try, \nNo hell below us, \nAbove us only sky.\n\nWe are resting\
  \ on the steps of Time Square absorbing the city sounds. I hold my backpack tight\
  \ and look around at the multiple luminous screens. Hell\u2019s Kitchen is never\
  \ silent, never resting as a heart in a body. Human hustle and cars buzzing are\
  \ the hosts of the place. We move towards the 5th Avenue to figure out some noise.\
  \ As if celebrating something people are dancing and singing there. Everything and\
  \ everybody is rainbow-colored. It must be the famous Pride Parade. This is how\
  \ freedom looks like; totally unacceptable in our country. My friend and I smile\
  \ at each other and mingle with the crowd. \n\nWe are looking up at Freedom Tower.\
  \ It seems endless and lonely. A plane is crossing the sky up above, and this image\
  \ gives me goose bumps. We are approaching September 11 Memorial fountains. What\
  \ a solemn symbol, like a river of tears going down to the center of the earth.\
  \ I am tired, so I lay down on a bench aside. Holding my backpack tight I rest my\
  \ head on the lap of my friend, and face the sky. Back in time one could see the\
  \ Twin Towers burying their tops in this sky; and even a young Frenchman walking\
  \ on a high wire right between them. This piece of sky breathes a great history,\
  \ this piece of land soaked in a great grief. \n\nWe are on the embankment at last.\
  \ The reddish horizon outlines the shape of Statue of Liberty. My friend looks at\
  \ me with a sad smile; it\u2019s time to say good bye. We have been dreaming of\
  \ this trip for years, and the way we made it is the last thing I expected. I wipe\
  \ my tears and get the urn with his ashes from my backpack. Fare thee well, my friend,\
  \ now your spirit resides in the place you were dreaming of: in a salty air of the\
  \ Bay, in the sound of never sleeping city, and in the silence of Strawberry fields."
