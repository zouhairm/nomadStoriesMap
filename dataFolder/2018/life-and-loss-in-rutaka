Text: "Abandoned. I make my way past a mud brick house sitting atop a ridge in the\
  \ remote Rutaka Valley. In the golden hour of the morning light particles bounce\
  \ around making pronounced the deep red clay of the path I walk, and greens of endless\
  \ hills that stretch into the distance. Rwanda is referred to as the \u2018land\
  \ of a thousand hills\u2019 \u2013 this description has never been more lucid. \
  \ As I come over a ridge I gaze upon the Nyagako River. Over thousands of years\
  \ it has forged a path through the landscape. In the foreground an elderly man sits\
  \ waiting. \n\nAs part of a team of 10 volunteers with the non-profit Bridges to\
  \ Prosperity Iocals in the valley are keen to introduce themselves. Waiting for\
  \ an extended family member, Pascal expresses appreciation for the new bridge due\
  \ to a personal tragedy. I ask him if he would be willing to spend time talking;\
  \ he obliges. But not today. There is work to do today.\n\nTwo days later I return\
  \ to Pascal with the team translator and project manager. On a rocky outcrop overlooking\
  \ the valley Pascal tells us his story.\nAlthough 57 years old, a lifetime of labour\
  \ adds 10 years to his appearance. He explains the difficulties of crossing the\
  \ river in the wet season, and how on average between 100-150kg of crops are lost.\
  \ However, there is a deeper reason for his invitation. Nine years earlier he asked\
  \ his younger brother Innocent to tend crops on the opposite side of the river.\
  \ Innocent lost his footing on a makeshift log bridge; swept away, his body was\
  \ never found. \nCarrying a profound burden for asking his brother to make that\
  \ journey, Pascal explains: \n\n\"Sometimes one can have great sorrow. To reduce\
  \ the burden I will share this sorrow. This is why I am happy to share this story\
  \ of my brother.\"\n\nAs time passes Pascal invites us into his home. We follow\
  \ him through the doorway greeted by scripture above the entrance. We sit down and\
  \ Pascal offers banana juice he made earlier in the day. Served from a jerry can,\
  \ it provides an opportunity for questions about what life is like in the UK, and\
  \ explanations around why mothers push their children around in buggies! It must\
  \ be difficult to carry water if you have to push a buggy?\n\nNeeded on site, we\
  \ leave the family. Pascal takes us up to the main path where we stand outside the\
  \ abandoned house. A small bush guards the entrances \u2013 reminder that this space\
  \ is not to be entered. Innocent\u2019s house provides a poignant reminder of his\
  \ brother\u2019s burden - its image remains etched in my memory."
