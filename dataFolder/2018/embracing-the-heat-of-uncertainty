Text: "One hour in and I was full of regret.\n\u201CWe should have NEVER LEFT!\u201D\
  \nThe sun was bearing down on the three of us.  Just past high noon in the middle\
  \ of the Yucat\xE1n, we were stuck with the peak heat of midday, much like our sweat\
  \ soaked shirts were stuck to our midbacks.  \nA mile of off beaten jungle trail\
  \ and another two miles of gravel road already traversed, our 750 mL water bottles\
  \ were dwindling down to the last few sips.  Three feet of grass and then sparse\
  \ jungle covered either side of the road, but it did little to provide us any shade\
  \ with the sun directly overhead.      \nBehind us, we could hear another car approaching.\
  \  Hope once again resurfaced and we stuck out our thumbs.  A small white sedan,\
  \ dust flying in the air behind it, showed no signs of slowing down.  Full of despair,\
  \ my arm was by my side before it managed to pass by.  I could feel the gravel sediment\
  \ settle on the end of my arm hair.\nLooking down at the illuminated road, the sun\u2019\
  s light reflected up in my face.  I began to contemplate giving up and heading back.\
  \  Only being four days into the international excursion, making the decision to\
  \ try and hitchhike to the nearest town eight miles away was one of the first truly\
  \ liberating decisions I had ever made in my life.  Walking the entire way wasn\u2019\
  t part of the plan.\n\u201CWe have to visualize it.\u201D\nFighting back a complete\
  \ mental breakdown, I was picturing a small pickup truck stopping just ahead of\
  \ us.\nSeveral minutes pass, sweat beads running down our faces.  Behind us, on\
  \ the hazy horizon we hear another car approaching.\nThere was no hesitation at\
  \ this point with the hitchhiking.  Thumbs were out, arms fully extended.  Once\
  \ it became within clear eyesight, I saw that it was a small red pickup flying towards\
  \ us.  \nVROOMMMM! \nAnother one right past us.   \nJust as we\u2019d given up on\
  \ the truck, we see its brake lights off in the distance.  Filled with elation we\
  \ hurried towards the truck.  Excitement building, a hint of relief, along with\
  \ uncertainty and restraint as we have no idea what the next part of the journey\
  \ holds."
