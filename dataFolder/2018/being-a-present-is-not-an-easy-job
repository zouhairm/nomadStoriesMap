Text: "That\xB4s going to be so embarrassing, I thought. I was hidden in a small room\
  \ in the back of a bar, wearing a piggy pink tutu and a twinkling top which made\
  \ me look like a mirror ball. Next to me was a huge birthday present sitting, wrapped\
  \ in white and purple paper, with a huge pink bow on the top. Well, I have to say\
  \ I didn\xB4t see this coming at all. I was actually just here as a coworker, in\
  \ the small town Great Barrington in Massachusetts, USA.\n\nTwo weeks ago a friend\
  \ of my housemother, Bob, asked me if I could do him a favor. A good friend of his\
  \ turned 70 years old and Bob wanted it to become a special party. Smiling he told\
  \ me about his idea. I first took it as a joke, but in fact it wasn\xB4t. I can\xB4\
  t remember saying yes, but to be honest, I also didn\xB4t really say no. So there\
  \ I was - in my hilarious outfit, waiting to be delivered as a present.\n\nThe door\
  \ opened and Bob came in. \"Are you ready?\", he asked, with a big smile on his\
  \ face. Ready? Am I ready? That was a good question. My body, this traitor, already\
  \ started to get nervous and my heart was in my mouth. After taking a deep breath\
  \ I said yes. He helped me to get on a small cart and covered me with the big box.\
  \ Abruptly all was dark and noises got weaker. He and some helpers stuffed the rest\
  \ of the remaining space I had left with colorful balloons. As if it wasn\xB4t already\
  \ tight enough in here, I thought ironically. \n\nThe cart started to move, slow\
  \ but steady. When the guests recognized that something was happening, they became\
  \ quiet probably watching the present rolling in. I couldn\xB4t really tell how\
  \ their face expression was or what they thought, since I was captured in this box.\
  \ We stopped, my mouth got dry. I just had a really short and super simple text\
  \ to say - \"Happy Birthday!\" But all of the sudden it sounded so horribly complicated.\
  \ Bob started his speech for his good friend. And then he knocked on the box - my\
  \ turn! I lifted myself up and already had a loud and cheerful \"Happy Birthday!\"\
  \ on my lips, when I suddenly lost control. The cart tipped and I fell towards the\
  \ ground. Bum!\n\nAfter everybody made sure I was fine, they started a mix of laughing\
  \ and feeling sorry for me. The situation reminded me of these funny videos, where\
  \ people make stupid things to get attention. \u201CAm I one of them now?\u201D\
  , I asked myself shocked. I knew it would be embarrassing - and yes, it really was.\
  \  \n\nBut still, I will never forget this day, when I fell out of a birthday present."
