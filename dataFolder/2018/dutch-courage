Text: "At 23 with a thirst for adventure, I decided to do something different.  So\
  \ with a complete stranger I met off the Internet, I packed my rucksack and made\
  \ my way to the airport with a guy called Paul.\n\nThe chatter of stag parties and\
  \ buzz of tourists added to my excitement as we arrived at Schipnol Airport. We\
  \ had reached our destination; Amsterdam.  Far from being 5 stars, we made our way\
  \ to the Flying Pig, with basic hostel accommodation and a bargain price of \xA3\
  12 per night.\n\nThroughout the trip we wandered aimlessly, admiring canals, looking\
  \ at antiques, and visiting the Sex Museum, laughing at the tacky porn and ceramic\
  \ phalluses on display. We walked through the Red Light District, watching as sad\
  \ women in lingerie stood in windows, but were both shocked when Paul was suddenly\
  \ hit by a car. Luckily, he survived and we stumbled to the safety of the hostel\
  \ with its fresh Amstel and wonderful foreigners.\n\nAvoiding the seedier side of\
  \ Amsterdam, we appreciated art at the Rjjks Museum, gazing on the Netherland\u2019\
  s national treasures.  We visited the zoo and laughed as a lion sprayed tourists\
  \ who were too close to its cage, and stopped at the Hemp Hotel, sampling lollies\
  \ and space cakes, which made us giggle. \n\nEverything was going well, Amsterdam\
  \ was a dream like city with friendly Dutch folk, legal drugs, beautiful antiques,\
  \ and good food, but then came the dare.  I don\u2019t know it came about, but somehow\
  \ my travelling companion and I made a pact. \n\nI wasn\u2019t usually an adrenaline\
  \ junkie and the thought of getting my nether regions pierced in the Netherlands\
  \ put me on edge. Walking into one of the many piercing parlours we enquired how\
  \ much it cost. With my heart pounding and legs shaking, we walked upstairs. \n\n\
  \u201CWho\u2019s first?\u201D Asked a woman with a needle in her hand.  \n\u201C\
  You just use a needle?\u201D I enquired.  \n\u201CYes,\u201D she replied. \nAt that\
  \ point, I looked at Paul, Paul looked at me, and we both looked at the lady before\
  \ us.  \u201CWe\u2019re not together,\u201D I explained, as I ushered Paul out of\
  \ the room, to his disappointment.\n\nSo there I was 23, in a strange city, a seedy\
  \ smoked filled city full of culture, friendly Dutch people, and wonderful artwork,\
  \ mixed with cannabis, sex shops, and strippers, lying on a bed with a beautiful\
  \ woman waiting to stick a needle through my privates, with the possibility I might\
  \ lose all sensation.  \n\nAlthough it was the last thing I expected, in one adrenaline\
  \ fuelled decision I had forged a friendship and a love for a city of acceptance\
  \ where anything goes."
