Text: "The sun beating down on me, dried salt covers my body from the waters of the\
  \ Mediterranean. I take a deep breath and flip onto my stomach, two months have\
  \ blurred by and now it was my final week. I played with the sand in my hands making\
  \ different patterns and then destroying them with a swipe of my hand, lifting the\
  \ pristine white sand up into my hands and watching gravity drag it back down, an\
  \ endless cycle giving the illusion of endless time. The sand never fully left you,\
  \ there was always some in your hair, on your skin, between your toes, time never\
  \ ran out if it did not fall. Tired of playing God, I slowly stand feeling the sweet\
  \ release of bones cracking into place, and the warm sand moulding around my feet,\
  \ telling me to stay and enjoy a little bit longer. I walk away from my towel and\
  \ down towards the iridescent water, I let the waves drag me into their cold embrace\
  \ and float to their rhythm. There are children laughing and playing around me and\
  \ Italian mothers screeching at them to come back in, I dip my head underneath the\
  \ waves and swim further from shore until I can't touch the bottom. I relax and\
  \ float on my back feeling like I'm weightless. I go on like this for what seems\
  \ like hours but is probably a minute and then jerk back into awareness with the\
  \ screams of the children. Looking back to shore I see them panicking, I struggle\
  \ to make out what they are saying, until I paddle a little closer, then the screams\
  \ become clearer.\n\"Medusa! Medusa! Medusa!\" they scream.\nAt first I think of\
  \ the mythological lady with snakes for hair, but that doesn't seem right. I see\
  \ them screaming and pointing at the water, realization clicks. My legs and arms\
  \ are thrashing into the water as quickly as they can go, I'm not going fast enough,\
  \ the screams are getting louder, I'm getting closer. We all rush to shore like\
  \ a big human wave. All interconnected and struggling to safety, panicking and looking\
  \ at one another, looking at the water for any signs of them. I'm close to shore\
  \ now, I'm so close to safety.\nInhale.\nExhale.\nI feel the sand beneath my feet,\
  \ the sand that moulds around my feet. I look around and everybody is breathing\
  \ hard, but out of the water and onto safe land. I lock eyes with a native and feel\
  \ an understanding pass between us, a smile breaks out onto my face and the catches\
  \ on the native bringing a smile to his face to. \nA medusa caused this type of\
  \ panic, something so simple and innocent, something that has no spine.\nA medusa,\
  \ a jellyfish, a smile, a connection."
