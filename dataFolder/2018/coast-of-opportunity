Text: "Walking the resort beach of the Jamaican land in the early sunrise, I was able\
  \ to fully taken in the simplicity of the landscape before the beach became full\
  \ of tourists. Tourists are what brings money to a country that is so poor that\
  \ many members of their family live together for years to make ends meet. They say\
  \ getting a job at a hotel along the beach makes way for a great opportunity.  Some\
  \ travel many miles from inland, in order to come to the coast of opportunity.\n\
  Tourist accommodations suppress the natural beauty of this beautiful terrain; nevertheless,\
  \ it being extremely vital to blend it in to their natural culture over the years\
  \ of suppression.\nAs I walk the beach, feeling the sand between my toes, smelling\
  \ the salty air, finding crabs in their shells poking their little heads out in\
  \ curiosity, I come across a local Jamaican ready to start his day. Grounded and\
  \ attuned to my five senses, I get approached by this man. He is trying to sell\
  \ me a ride on his boat, a tour of the local coastal area. I can feel his sense\
  \ of urgency and persistence to make a sale in this poor country is taking its toll.\
  \ I politely declined his offer. Being aware of his insistence, I connected with\
  \ him heart to heart. \nObserving the locals for the past couple of days, I have\
  \ seen some common gestures that the locals do when trying to make a deal. After\
  \ many attempts of landing a sale, most travelers will just walk away while the\
  \ Jamaican will come back to do a fist bump and say \u201CRespect\u201D in closure.\
  \ After noticing these motions, I was able to use it in practice.\nAfter the second\
  \ attempt of him trying to persuade me for ride. I politely said, \u201CNo, Thank\
  \ you, but Respect.\u201D I acknowledge his needs by reaching my hand out in a fist\
  \ bump. He softens in recognition that he couldn\u2019t influence my decision, but\
  \ accepted me and my choice.\nBecause the country is so poor, the locals use what\
  \ they can to survive. Their emotions enter through your heart. Through the heart,\
  \ they can sway your ideals to match their own. They aren\u2019t immoral by trying\
  \ to provide for their family in such ways because it is their only means of passage.\n\
  The soul of the country is shown through the eyes of the people. Among the landscapes,\
  \ history, and culture of the locals, tourists get a rare glimpse of the lifestyle\
  \ of the region that they briefly inhabit.  In order to go beyond of what is seen,\
  \ you have to go within the lightness of heart of an individual. Tourists create\
  \ hope in change and opportunity."
