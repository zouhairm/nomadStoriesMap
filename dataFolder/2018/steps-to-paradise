Text: "I can\u2019t even begin to tell you how many times a day I catch myself drifting\
  \ into a paradise of a thousand beautiful thoughts about Costa Rica, and everything\
  \ I experienced there. Sunsets, smiles, warm sun on my back, water, waves, and of\
  \ course the people. \nPeople like Henry with his winning smile, the young local\
  \ from Quepos who worked at a treehouse hotel. Or Din, the pretty waitress at the\
  \ cloud forest lodge, who was sweet as pie. And at the beach, the surfing legend-turned\
  \ restaurant owner, with his handsome weathered skin and brazen self-confidence.\
  \ Thanks to these chance encounters with these locals, my trip was enriched. Although\
  \ many people in Costa Rica speak English, I took advantage of my Spanish language\
  \ ability and made lasting friendships on my ten day adventure. \nPerhaps my favorite\
  \ friend is Henry, the 24-year-old working at a hotel near Manuel Antonio National\
  \ Park. He did everything from carrying guest bags, to patching and painting walls.\
  \ He was tall, well-built, and very good looking, when he offered to show me how\
  \ to work the A/C unit in my room, I didn\u2019t tell him I already knew how! Later\
  \ that afternoon he asked to take me to the \u201Csecret\u201D lookout point on\
  \ the hotel property at the top of a steep, outdoor staircase. I followed him up\
  \ the steps that seemed to go on forever. He turned back a few times to tell me\
  \ that we were almost there, and that the view would be worth the climb. He was\
  \ right. Water, trees, the sun shining over the bay, and Henry watching my reaction\
  \ to the most gorgeous view I had ever seen. I handed Henry my phone and asked him\
  \ to take a picture of me, with that breathtaking view behind me. As he snapped\
  \ the photo he said \u201Cbeautiful....and the view is pretty too.\u201D I could\
  \ feel my thirty-something-year-old face grow warm and flushed. \u201CGracias Henry,\u201D\
  \ I said as we descended the crooked, weathered steps back down to reality."
