Text: "We had three very long drive days ahead as we headed back down south through\
  \ C\xF4te d\u2019Ivoire, to Man, so we could see the colossal La Cascade Waterfall\
  \ and finally cross the border into Guinea. We were supposed to cross the border\
  \ in the north, but due to some people\u2019s visas not being valid yet we couldn\u2019\
  t cross. On the evening of our first day\u2019s drive, we camped beside the road,\
  \ the border of Guinea being tantalisingly close less than a mile away.\n\nThe second\
  \ day was a continuation of yesterday\u2019s push to the Guinea border. By mid-afternoon,\
  \ we came off the tarmac and ended up driving along a tiny dirt track littered with\
  \ little log bridges and huge ruts that swallowed the whole truck. \n\nSmall settlements\
  \ were dotted along its course and as the sun started to set, we found a football\
  \ pitch in which to camp. Our driver got the village chiefs permission, and the\
  \ whole of Guiapleu village came out to welcome us. We danced with the kids and\
  \ played football with the teenagers, and once the sun set we all sat round the\
  \ fire. I was trying and failing to communicate with the little French I knew, so\
  \ resorted to taking photos of the atmosphere, and people we were surrounded by.\
  \ We slept under the eternally mesmerising Milky Way, as a lightening storm drifted\
  \ past around 15km away.\n\nI woke to the noise of locals interacting with those\
  \ of us who were up and preparing breakfast, and once the camp was taken down, we\
  \ went into Guiapleu village on an invite from the chief to look around. It was\
  \ a small village, with maybe 50 houses and a few hundred residents. It turns out\
  \ the residents of Guiapleu are made up of many nationalities including: Ivorian,\
  \ Guinean, Liberian, Burkinabe and Malian. Many of them have fled persecution or\
  \ war. I spoke to one teenage girl from Liberia whose family fled during the Siege\
  \ of Monrovia (which resulted in the deaths of around 1,000 civilians) at the end\
  \ of the Second Liberian Civil War. There is also both a Catholic and Protestant\
  \ church as well as a Mosque in the village, and it was nice to see such a strong\
  \ sense of community and belonging, in an area in which the media reports strong\
  \ tensions between separate groups of people.\n\nI detached myself from the rest\
  \ of our group to wander round, I played football with the local lads, learnt the\
  \ universal game of pushing a bike tyre with a stick and took portraits of people.\
  \ In return for their hospitality, we gave them two full trays of eggs and promised\
  \ to tell their story of harmony."
