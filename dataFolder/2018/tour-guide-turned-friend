Text: "She stood there, looking at me, grinning from ear to ear, with the same childlike\
  \ pride that I remembered on my own face when I looked at the drawings taped to\
  \ our refrigerator. She was pointing at a full-page photograph of a man in a decorated\
  \ military uniform. \u201CMy grandfather\u201D she said, her voice trailing off\
  \ I replied, \u201Che fought in the war?\u201D she merely nodded, still smiling.\
  \ \n The photograph was framed on a wooden wall accompanied by a number of smaller\
  \ photographs, filled with smiling faces of children, and adults, having the time\
  \ of their lives. Outside, I heard a few of the same children pictured, laughing\
  \ as they played Chinese jump rope with some extra torn up rags, tied together,\
  \ like a long hand-made kite tail. She pointed to another photograph of a young,\
  \ beautiful Vietnamese woman. I looked at her, \u201CYou?\u201D I said. Her smile\
  \ softened as she nodded. I looked at the woman in front of me. She was much shorter\
  \ than myself, only coming up to below my shoulder height. In the dim light, I could\
  \ see the age in her face, the wrinkles creasing her dark skin like dry riverbeds,\
  \ hardened in the sun. She had gained weight since the photograph, from years of\
  \ bearing the children playing outside. She was still the same beautiful, in a hardened\
  \ sort of way, though she retained a slight twinkle in her eye, mirroring the girl\
  \ in the photograph. \n I looked around my surroundings, at the dark room I was\
  \ standing in, at the dirt floor, the single table, and the two beds in the corner.\
  \ The climate was crisp, a small oasis from the humidity outside. Above me, a loft\
  \ created a second floor, holding all of the rice, which would sustain this family\
  \ of seven, for the rest of the year. There were about twenty bags or so, stacked\
  \ on top of each other neatly, a tower of carbohydrates. \n She led me back outside,\
  \ into the blazing sunlight. \u201CTime to feed baby\u201D she said, motioning for\
  \ me to wait with the children. I turned to the three young girls, all dressed in\
  \ the same traditional Hmong clothing as their mother. Shyly, they led me to their\
  \ game, and began to show me the correct movements. Clumsily, I began jumping between\
  \ the ropes, right, middle, left middle, over and over. The young girls shrieked\
  \ with laughter as I stumbled through the movements. I smiled, and pondered, I barely\
  \ knew this woman, and here I was at her home, with her family, eleven miles deep\
  \ in the mountains of northern Vietnam. She was a symbol of love perfectly communicated,\
  \ forever woven into the fabric of my memory."
