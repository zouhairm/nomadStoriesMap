Text: "I stand, mouth slightly agape, a look of confusion and terror undoubtedly mixing\
  \ upon my face, as I survey the swarming scene before me. I attempt to comb my nerves\
  \ into a tidy state of order and respectability, as I step hesitantly forward into\
  \ the chaos of Haitian travel.  \n\nI'm invited (with a light shove) onto an ecstatically-bright\
  \ painted Tap-Tap (a converted pickup truck that functions as the main form of transportation\
  \ in most of Haiti). So much for remaining cool and aloof, I think, as hands pass\
  \ me along and I stumble over the legs of those seated, until quick words and eager\
  \ pushing from behind guide me to my own special spot on the bench. \n\nI\u2019\
  m half sitting on a ladies lap to my left, and am completely squished up to the\
  \ man on my right. In fact, limbs are everywhere entangled, overlapped and pressed\
  \ against one another. Not only are the seats piled beyond capacity, but the aisle\
  \ is filled in with yet more bodies, all seemingly shouting in the expressive Haitian\
  \ Creole. \n\nI do not like to be touched. At least, I never thought so. I come\
  \ from a culture of polite distance and sheltered emotions. Here, they don\u2019\
  t have the luxury of modesty and space. Privacy doesn\u2019t even exist, with 10\
  \ people living out of a one room, dirt-floor house and one family\u2019s living\
  \ space spilling into the next. \n\nThis is Haiti: A culture so alive, bright, unafraid\
  \ and expressive, that there is no room for hesitation or shyness. I can not hold\
  \ myself at a distance-I have to get messy.\n\nThe last few people leap into their\
  \ places, swinging off the back of the truck. To signal the journey is underway,\
  \ the driver cranks up the hyperactive island music to a deafening volume.\n\nHere\
  \ I am, snuggling in the heat with a couple dozen strangers, all of us jostling\
  \ together, as we zip down the ocean road. And in this intimate heap of humanity,\
  \ a sudden wave of joy wells up in me. Joy as inescapable as the music that pounds\
  \ into my head filling any potential for thought or the ubiquitous smell of burning\
  \ trash that fills the air. Joy as inescapable as the human contact that I\u2019\
  m alarmed to discover I find not just comforting, but exciting.\n\nMy senses have\
  \ been so abundantly filled, that all I can do is spill. Before I know it, I am\
  \ laughing out loud. It tumbles out of me, pure and uninhibited. I have thrust myself\
  \ into the breathing, sweating, raw heart of Haiti--and Haiti has thrust right back.\
  \ A woman looks at me, responding to my public display of random laughter with an\
  \ easy smile."
