Text: "Stepping out of a small coffee-cum-momo parlor, I strolled past the gate of\
  \ a famous tea garden of Sikkim.\nMy thoughts and perception of time froze as the\
  \ canvas painted by Nature spread out before me. At the backdrop of the Kanchendzonga,\
  \ the garden was laid over a gradually sloping hill. A mud path wound up and down\
  \ the slope until it waned into infinity and on either side of it, fresh tea plants\
  \ were taking sun baths.\nThis was not my first visit to a tea garden, and yet these\
  \ vast slopes of green leaves that are sold for $40 per kg, made me hold my breath.\n\
  But then, I hardly knew Sikkim, or rather, any place was beyond these observable\
  \ spectacles as the real extravaganza was in the hearts of their people.\nAs I stared,\
  \ I saw four human figures, none older than ten, emerge up the slope. White uniforms\
  \ with creases, school bags hung loose and chattering like little birds. As they\
  \ came near, I saw it as an opportunity to know the locals and walked towards them\
  \ with a welcoming grin on my face. The kids paused and looked up at me suspiciously.\
  \ They had typical Nepali faces, eyes reflecting endless mischief and reddish cheeks\
  \ reflecting the harsh winters.\nFive minutes later, I was friends with three of\
  \ them while the fourth one went ahead eating a pack of biscuits and oblivious to\
  \ the rest of the world. The tallest of them was the most talkative and stepped\
  \ out as a leader. He was in third grade and introduced me to the gang that included\
  \ one of his classmates and his brother from the first grade.\nThey went on to explain\
  \ me the tea picking process and introduced me to the trees of the region. At one\
  \ point, they asked for my phone. Although a bit nervous, I complied and as I saw\
  \ them fiddle with the device, a smile spread across my lips. The awkward selfie\
  \ we took, where I had to hunch a lot, later found a place on my bedroom wall.\n\
  When I asked them about school, the sad reality stung my heart. It was three miles\
  \ from the village and they had to walk that distance every day. Coming from a city,\
  \ where we whine over long traffics, I saw, how trivial my problems were.\n\u201C\
  Life is so tough,\u201D I said with pity in my eyes. \u201CWalking for miles in\
  \ this chilling weather is something I can\u2019t even think of.\u201D\nAt this,\
  \ the kids grinned, exchanged glances, and laughed. \u201CNo, dada. We meet and\
  \ form groups and walk together. It's so much fun.\"\nAnd in that moment, I realized,\
  \ life is not in the hardships and pains that we face every day, but in the smiles\
  \ that we live and we spread."
