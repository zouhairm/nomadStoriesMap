Text: "Everyone knows that thorough planning is essential when trying to keep unexpected\
  \ costs low when traveling! BUT my last trip to Japan showed me that not planning\
  \ can lead you to some of the BEST experiences!\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong! I\u2019\
  m a complete stress-head and I planned a lot of things! I knew I\u2019d need a rail\
  \ pass and did my research into the benefits vs cost of the JR pass (look into it,\
  \ it\u2019s super convenient and relatively cheap but only if you want to travel\
  \ large portions of Japan in one trip). I also knew a number of places I simply\
  \ NEEDED to visit BUT... other than that, I decided to leave my itinerary almost\
  \ blank.\n\nThis may seem crazy and I was scared it would ruin my holiday but these\
  \ days there\u2019s really no shortage of hotel rooms, hostel bunks or hosts. So...\
  \ download the Couch surfing app, and stop stressing! I was never without a great\
  \ place to stay and met some very cool people!\n\nI went to Japan in October because\
  \ it\u2019s not the peak tourist season and one experience I knew I needed to have\
  \ was Halloween in Shibuya! If you\u2019ve ever been to Shibuya crossing you\u2019\
  ll never forget the sheer density of the crowd but however dense you picture it\
  \ to be is no comparison to Halloween!\nI spent the first hour of my evening trying\
  \ to cross the road with 100\u2019s of Where\u2019s Wally (Waldo) look-a-likes before\
  \ giving up on my well structured plans. I instead opened the Couch surfing app\
  \ to see if any other strangers in the crowd wanted to hang out. I soon found a\
  \ community of 12 tourists all looking for drinks and adventure. We met out the\
  \ front of a 7-11 (grabbed some Suntory highballs and fresh sushi while we were\
  \ there) and had the absolute best night of the whole trip! We just went with the\
  \ crowd and ended up at karaoke at 4am with some awesome locals, sang our hearts\
  \ out while taking advantage of BigEcho\u2019s \u201Call you can drink\u201D package.\
  \ AND went to some really beautiful little nooks that we wouldn\u2019t have found\
  \ with out wandering about!\nI also made some great friendships and travel buddies\
  \ for the remainder of my trip! I never expected to see SO much without planning\
  \ it but I truly experienced so much more simply because I left my itinerary blank.\n\
  So don\u2019t plan your next trip! Plan the essentials: tickets, transport, phone\
  \ data and cash (don\u2019t rely on card in Japan) but leave the rest up to your\
  \ sense of wonder and curiosity!\nAfter all, it\u2019s not an adventure if you already\
  \ know what will happen."
