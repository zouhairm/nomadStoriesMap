Text: "Slumped upon the wrinkled sheets prone from a night of restless slumber; my\
  \ tired eyes glazed through the promiscuous endeavors of acquired social media acquaintances.\
  \  Heavy lids slowly resealing when a flicker of red illuminated in the corner of\
  \ the screen. A message. There inside was an open invitation to go Snowboarding!\
  \ With a feral of energy along with a stupendous excitement of this opportune moment,\
  \ I jumped out of bed. Absent of any hesitation I instantaneously replied and there\
  \ I was four weeks later, 2000 meters high in the Alps of Austria.\nDroplets of\
  \ snow spat down hitting my face as I boarded the barred lift for the first time.\
  \ Nerves proliferating beneath my skin as I watched the space magnify between my\
  \ feet and snow bellow. Peering over the barrier in fear and admiration as the \u2018\
  pros\u2019 shot down the slopes with smooth casual style. What was I doing here\
  \ I began to question myself? I had never been snowboarding before, not this kind;\
  \ a couple of hours in an indoor snow slope was the only experience I had on my\
  \ resume. Was it my unconscious incompetence that had lead me to say yes to that\
  \ spontaneous invite and to be here in this exact moment? The winds deafened my\
  \ internal voice. I poked my head down again, this time noticing the occasional\
  \ tumble from a novice. A short relief come over me reminding myself that I wouldn\u2019\
  t be the only one kissing the snow today.\nThe landing zone approached rapidly and\
  \ before I even had the chance to comprehend the commotion, I was on land again.\
  \ The board slid like ice on glass. I just about managed to keep my balance long\
  \ enough to get far enough away from oncoming skiers before collapsing into the\
  \ snow. Thankfully I was saved the embarrassment of having the lift stopped for\
  \ me. My friend looked at me with a smirk of reassurance as she gave me a hand up.\
  \ Patting the flakes of snow off, I stood up perplexed as I witnessed the most awe-inspiring\
  \ view of the Austrian Alps. Snow blanketed the ground surpassing my field of vision,\
  \ tips of tree protruded from the unbroken pristine sheets outlining the mountainous\
  \ contours of its natural beauty. This picturesque scene was amplified by the streaming\
  \ of sunlight through the untouched skies and the cold fresh air that breathed life\
  \ into my city congested airways. I was immediately rejuvenated."
