Text: "I have always been fascinated by getting to know people - getting to know their\
  \ opinions, thoughts, believes, decisions and ways of lives. Through getting to\
  \ know other people, I feel I can learn so much, and experience personal growth.\n\
  In March last year, I quit my job working as a lawyer and began a journey which,\
  \ I hoped would give me much more to think about.\nI found volunteering to be the\
  \ best way to get to know people. Volunteering allowed me to do something without\
  \ expecting anything in return, with an opportunity to see the ways people from\
  \ all over the world live in their most intimate environment: their home. I expected\
  \ that sharing meals and working together would show me their real face, their real\
  \ character.\nWhat I hoped for actually happened. I encountered many kinds of personalities\
  \ and observed many kinds of behaviors and reactions. I could see the real people,\
  \ not the ones hidden behind a mask.\nMy plan was to spend each month in a different\
  \ country to experience the lives of different people and their cultures.\nUruguay,\
  \ Chile, Iceland, Azores islands, Finland, Switzeland, Italy, Spain, Namibia and\
  \ New Zealand were for some time my home and the people I lived with were my families.\n\
  During my travels I got into many situations and my skin would tingle when I realised\
  \ that what I was expecting from this journey was coming true.\nEvery single meeting\
  \ (and now I mean not only the members of the families for whom I was volunteering\
  \ but also the people who I met on the way too) was enermously enriching and I could\
  \ barely wait for the next encounter.\nThrough all of my travels, I continued to\
  \ ask myself, \"Life, what do you have prepared for me? What person will you send\
  \ in to my life? What questions should I think about? What should I learn and what\
  \ should I teach?\nI am convinced that nothing in our lives happens by a coincidence.\
  \ Everything that happens to us has a purpose. We can often see this purpose when\
  \ we look back and reflect on past experiences.\nI believe our life is like a puzzle\
  \ and that the pieces will eventually all fit together, even if we sometimes think\
  \ they will not.\nThrough making close connections with locals from different parts\
  \ of the world, I feel that I am gaining knowledge and the wisdom to make better\
  \ decisions. \nMaking good decisions and bettering my understanding have become\
  \ integral parts of my life.\nI am very thankful to every person who has crossed\
  \ my path. These people have helped me become the person I am today."
