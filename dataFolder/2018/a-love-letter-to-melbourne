Text: "Dear Melbourne,\n\n You\u2019ve proven me the little-town-heart that you have\
  \ when you got me in touch with your cute suburb Saint Kilda. The palm trees, the\
  \ bay, the people, and amazing vibe has touched my heart.\n\n I have lived inside\
  \ of you and I have never seen so many dirty dished and trash on the floor but outside\
  \ of the apartment you\u2019re such a beautiful babe!\n\nI can\u2019t say anything\
  \ but thank you: for letting me jump off the pier bud naked, for letting me skate\
  \ in your bowl, for getting me in touch with amazing people, for awesome karaoke\
  \ nights, for a hectic trip to Grampians national park, for the times when I gave\
  \ boxing lessons in your park, for the over head waves of the gorgeousness of Torquay,\
  \ for the best/cheap surfboard, for the amazing weather (the first 2 months only)\
  \  and last but not least, for the hours and hours of laughter!!!\n\nI love you,\
  \ but it is now time to wave you goodbye and move on, you\u2019re just getting too\
  \ cold and back home they\u2019re making fun of me.\n\nWhen you see your beautiful\
  \ neighbor (the Great Ocean Road) again please tell her that I love her too. I saw\
  \ her last week for the last time and surfed her amazing curves with Alice, but\
  \ I forgot to tell her how gorgeous she is. Her windy roads and amazing nature are\
  \ craved in my heart. Chance is that I\u2019m never gonna see you again because\
  \ you keep growing and it won\u2019t be the same, so good luck on your own from\
  \ here. Take care and stay warm.\n\nAll my love to you,\nAsif\n\nEvery good thing\
  \ comes to an end and that doesn't necessarily needs to be a bad thing. Because\
  \ you know new good things will come and that\u2019s what life\u2019s all about.\n\
  \n\u201CBeginnings are usually scary and endings are usually sad, but it\u2019s\
  \ everything in between that makes life worth living.\u201D"
