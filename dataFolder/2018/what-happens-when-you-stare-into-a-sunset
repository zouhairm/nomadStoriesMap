Text: "At 18 years old, I made a life changing decision to scrap the conformist views\
  \ of attending university and travelled 5,400 km from my childhood home to live\
  \ in Italy. This was not only the best decision I ever made, but within the last\
  \ 9 months of living abroad, working and travelling, I have learned many valuable\
  \ things about myself and this world. \nThe most incredible experience I had spoke\
  \ to me on a very personal level, which is why I treasure that moment so much. In\
  \ late October, 2017, a group of friends and I took a hike through the historical\
  \ Italian town of Bergamo on a cloudy Sunday morning. \nThe day was so fun despite\
  \ the unpleasant weather, we saw all the classic Italian attributes the city had\
  \ to offer, and as the evening drew near we started the uphill hike to Citta Alta.\
  \ We found a quaint hillside bar with a panoramic view, although it was obstructed\
  \ by fog and clouds. We all enjoyed a glass of wine while being slightly disappointed\
  \ in the fact that the clouds were ruining our chances of seeing the sunset. \n\n\
  Suddenly the clouds started to part and the sky cleared. Our jaws dropped when the\
  \ hilltops started glowing bright orange. Between the red roofs of the Italian villas\
  \ and the blue sky was an ocean of orange and pink waves crashing over us, the sky\
  \ remained bright blue as the sun set into the horizon. Never in my life had I seen\
  \ something that penetrated my soul and left me speechless, unable to believe this\
  \ moment was really happening. \nI stared into the thinning lines of orange and\
  \ pink cloud, my heart overflowing with bliss as I became filled with inspiration.\
  \ I realized I had started to take this life for granted, and I had begun to lose\
  \ track of my goals. The miraculous beauty of this sunset reminded me of how passionate\
  \ I am about writing, travelling, and inspiring other people. Since that day I vowed\
  \ to become more serious about my blog, and to expand my skills in order to write\
  \ my own book someday."
