Text: "Can you remember what time you went to bed last Saturday?  How about on a Saturday\
  \ night after overindulging at a bar?  Me neither.  But I remember to the exact\
  \ moment when I went to bed 8 years ago on February 27th, 2010.  The answer?  3:33\
  \ AM, in Santiago, Chile.  It began ordinarily enough. Craig, a friend from college,\
  \ had just arrived in Santiago that afternoon, and we decided a night touring the\
  \ bars of Santiago would be the perfect way to celebrate.\n I remember the time\
  \ well because at 3:34 AM the explosions began. Bright white flashes visible through\
  \ my eyelids immediately after my head hit the pillow.  I bolted out of bed and\
  \ rushed to the window to see showers of sparks bursting from transformers around\
  \ the city which were immediately followed by city blocks going dark 4 at a time.\
  \  I realized what was happening when I heard a low rumbling sound. \u201CWaves\
  \ on the beach?\u201D I thought to myself. No, it was the sound of our apartment\
  \ building shaking.  A steady stream of expletives quickly followed, as Craig shouted,\
  \ \u201CWhat\u2019s going on!?\u201D.   I was watching an earthquake from the 18th\
  \ floor.  \nNormally in life, there is a feeling that a decision made now will affect\
  \ future events; but 18 floors up during an 8.0 earthquake, all I felt was a sense\
  \ of calming indifference; the building either falls, or it doesn\u2019t.  And with\
  \ that said, I decided to do the dumbest thing possible.  \u201CLet\u2019s go!\u201D\
  , I screamed to Craig, as I flung open the apartment door.  And off we down the\
  \ pitch-black hallway of the apartment building to begin the decent down 18 flights\
  \ of stairs.  Everyone else in the building was on the same page, and the stairwells\
  \ were packed with people.  As we made our way out of the still-shaking stairwell,\
  \ we were greeted by a chorus of sirens and what sounded like all 30,000 of Santiago\u2019\
  s street dog population barking and howling all at once.  \nPre- earthquake, I felt\
  \ I knew Santiago well, and that I had done a pretty good job of integrating myself\
  \ into local society\u2026one bar and dancefloor at a time.  But post-quake I saw\
  \ a different side of Santiago; getting handed a bottle of water as I walked past\
  \ a gas station at 6:00 AM on the night of the earthquake, or neighbors lending\
  \ each other the needed supplies to help fix the damages all of us had in our homes.\
  \  Nothing could have prepared me for that night, but the days and weeks that followed\
  \ brought a sense of community that shade the experience with other emotions besides\
  \ only fear and panic."
