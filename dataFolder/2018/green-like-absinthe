Text: "Green, like absinthe.\n\nIt\u2019s what I think as I crane my neck, careening\
  \ through the streets of Ubud. The landscape is a jade blaze, but it\u2019s more\
  \ than that; green climbs out of the walls here. It covers temples, creeps through\
  \ cobblestone, arcs over us as we shortcut through a monkey forest. In Ubud it feels\
  \ like life is forcing itself upon you from all sides. And perhaps that\u2019s why,\
  \ instead of enjoying a Balinese massage, I find myself on a stranger\u2019s scooter,\
  \ grappling her waist as she hurtles through a crowd toward the unknown.\n\nI\u2019\
  d met Anni just minutes before as I lounged in her spa waiting room, dreaming of\
  \ warm hands and flower petals. Clearly flustered, Anni explained her dilemma in\
  \ English far better than my Bahasa Indonesia. I grasped that they were quite busy\
  \ and it would be helpful if I could come back later; perhaps a free massage if\
  \ I might want to model for some promotions?\n\nBefore I\u2019d finished saying\
  \ \u201CSure!\u201D Anni was fitting her spare helmet on me.\n\nI\u2019d clearly\
  \ misunderstood.\n\nI\u2019m not one to leap with abandon onto strangers\u2019 vehicles,\
  \ unaware of our destination, but Ubud pumps magic into your veins and Anni\u2019\
  s face is kind. She fills in the gaps as we ride. They\u2019re filming a commercial\
  \ down the street with famous comedians. The actress is missing. And the Balinese\
  \ fates have chosen me and my sweaty ponytail to replace her.\n\nAnni zags around\
  \ one last corner into a buzzing market. A camera is set up, and my co-stars await.\
  \ They aren\u2019t a comedy troupe; they\u2019re a technicolor quartet of misfits,\
  \ stumbled out of a folktale. Prismatic batiks, wild-haired wigs, masks that transform\
  \ them from men into jesters, a demon, and a particularly entrancing woman with\
  \ apple cheeks and rabbit ears.\n\nI\u2019m directed to launch through the crowd\
  \ onto the demon\u2019s back, lamenting my tired legs. We run hand-in-hand through\
  \ windchimes and mirrors, seeking counsel from his fellow implings. I complain in\
  \ English; the jesters provide silly advice in Balinese; the apple-cheeked rabbit\
  \ woman sagely tells me only one spa will do. We tumble into a golf cart and drive\
  \ to the spa, our jesters clinging to the bumper.\n\nWe shoot our final scene and\
  \ hug goodbye; my co-stars and I still share no language but we have wordless jokes.\
  \ They\u2019re gone in an emerald flash, and I find myself back where I started\
  \ this day. I meet Anni in a quiet waiting room, massage impending, yet I\u2019\
  m as changed as Alice when she returns from the rabbit hole, the world as she left\
  \ it, and tea time at hand."
