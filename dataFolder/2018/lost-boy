Text: "Everyone loves travelling, don't they? If you walk down the street asking people,\
  \ they would say they do love travelling, I was one of them until I got lost in\
  \ Bangkok when I was 15 years old travelling with my family. Instead of panic, I\
  \ loved the feeling of travelling alone and to breathe the city in.\nThis love for\
  \ travelling led me to take my first backpacking trip in 2016 to Europe.\nStarting\
  \ from Amsterdam all the way upto Portugal, But in this story, I'll focus only on\
  \ Portugal.\nPortugal was one country that took me by surprise, even with all the\
  \ planning and reading 101 blogs, Nothing can prepare you for Lagos. \nLagos is\
  \ the southern tip of Portugal and with the waves gushing in against it's walls,\
  \ there are many caves or grottos as they call it along the shore.\nThe best way\
  \ to explore them is by Kayaking. So I decided to rent a Kayak, and I made my way\
  \ around the coast, I had expected to last 2 hours in the kayak knowing my own level\
  \ of fitness, but the waves being in low tide, exposed most of the grottos making\
  \ time fly by and I ended Kayaking for 6 hours. The feeling of rowing into a cave\
  \ is by far the most enthralling experience, I have jumped out of a plane but this\
  \ feeling still beats it.\nI was unfortunate with my phone, since water seeped into\
  \ the phone's bag, photos of the kayak trip are scarce. But in my head, I can hear\
  \ the sound of waves gushing on those gigantic cliffs and sunlight bouncing off\
  \ the golden sand beaches."
