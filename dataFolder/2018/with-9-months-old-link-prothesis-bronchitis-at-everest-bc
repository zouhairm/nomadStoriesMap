Text: "Why does one take the strain of marching to such a disgusting and inhospitable\
  \ place like Everest Base Camp 5364m above sea level;  Just to put your finger on\
  \ the foot of the highest mountain in the world once in a lifetime?!\nIn fact the\
  \ only beautiful thing around here is the morning or evening sun, which balances\
  \ behind the headstrong mountain peaks. Everything else is violence and aggression.\n\
  Unrelenting ice, cutting cold, shattered rock, masses of rock, pointed, edgy, unyielding;\
  \ harsh tension between the different elements, which at any time can be unloaded\
  \ in unrelenting violence against any life, quite surprisingly as in the earthquake\
  \ in 2015; And yet omnipresent palpable for the one who is willing to perceive.\n\
  Like a sling, the lack of oxygen also the altered pressure, lies around your neck,\
  \ the chest, the heart. One masters better the other worse. Some of the tourists\
  \ drag themselves even on the ascent with artificial oxygen and that's only the\
  \ way towards Base Camp of Everest\nNobody talks about. Even less about the walking\
  \ ghost-faces on the way back to Gorak Shep, first and last recovery-stop before\
  \ and after.\nGorak Shep, a place where EVERYDAY action is taken to rescue, more\
  \ or less prepared Everest-visitors from certain death.\nEvery day! Among the locals\
  \ this belongs to daily business. It is part of business\nThe lucky ones who are\
  \ able to watch a rescue mission often lately realize in this moment, what they\
  \ are getting into. In the radiant, triumphal faces of BaseCampReachers, you can\
  \ not see the exertions, the fear and tension, you also don't read about in travel\
  \ descriptions.\nThough, it's easy to guess from silence of avalanche-witnesses,\
  \ who attended Everest Base Camp in 2015. The locals don\u2019t talk about such\
  \ occurrences. Life consists of day-to-day business, of driving forward, above all,\
  \ real life affairs. Local people, when they laugh and they don't do it so often,\
  \ they do it loud, impressive, a little bit histeric maybe. I am missing natural\
  \ relax. The smile of the children from time to time gives me a more virgen sensation.\n\
  I am feeling my bumbing heart, my heavy legs, the freezing cold on my skin. I concentrate\
  \ on one step. Respiration is difficult. My bronchus are covered with phlegm. Another\
  \ step. One step after the other. I did it, I reached EBC. I'm not thinking about\
  \ my foot. No thoughts now. I am alive. I am walking down, back towards civilization.\
  \ I am lucky; Happy and fullfilled with the uniqueness of the majestic Himalayan."
