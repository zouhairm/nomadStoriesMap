Text: "I had to jump upon the blank seat as soon as we clambered into the train at\
  \ 7:30pm.Our destination NILACHAL hill of Bandarban.In the morning ,the serene nature\
  \ declared our arrival and local food at a cheap rate surpassed our expectation\
  \ of taste.We hired a Chander Gari(Moon Ride) to reach Nilachal along the zigzag\
  \ hilly road.9 am on my wrist watch  and I couldn\u2019t find my camera.Never imagined\
  \ I would lose it before the trip even started.Didn\u2019t get much time to be sad.On\
  \ the roadsides we saw the unending hill tracts of Bandarban,indeed a gift of mother\
  \ nature.A heavenly contrast of the vivacious green hills and the blue sky created\
  \ a dreamy arcadia where I could live forever and ever.Scented air went on splashing\
  \ upon my face as I was screaming with joy.It had awaken the asthete inside me.The\
  \ greenery beyond the horizon reflects blue like a godsend illusion for guests.The\
  \ long road to the top decorated in lances of sun piercing the leaves compelled\
  \ me to forget the sadness.We reached the spot when few tribal men were presenting\
  \ a song.The traditional instruments and a polished voice filled the lacuna of nature.He\
  \ was putting on a woven lungi,metal bracelets and rings. A toughness in his face\
  \ gave him a unique outlook.His song perfected the beauty of Nilachal.We couldn\u2019\
  t resist ourselves from an introduction with him.Deepak,was his name.He took us\
  \ to his house and offered lunch.Too busy with his hospitality,he went on telling\
  \ his story.He was excited about the gadgets we were carrying and touched our soul\
  \ with his innocent laughter while pressing the touch pad.We also introduced ourselves\
  \ and he could barely imagine anything about city life.However the sparkle of his\
  \ eyes plunged into deep imaginations.Such a passionate singer,a proud tribal and\
  \ a cultivator he was.Couldn\u2019t but admire his lifestyle being enthralled in\
  \ gossip with Deepak and requested one last song because it was almost sunset.I\
  \ felt like the light winged drayad sang along with him the divine verses of nature.We\
  \ hugged Deepak before boarding on the bus heading towards Cox\u2019s Bazar,our\
  \ final destination.He made us promise that we would visit him again.Half past midnight,I\
  \ was walking barefooted in the soft sandy beach.The majestic waves splashed upon\
  \ the shore and clumsy breeze whispered Deepak\u2019s voice.His laughter mixed with\
  \ the moonglade upon Bay of Bengal,sleepy murmurs of the night sky and my soul.Standing\
  \ under the starlit sky I heard a forgotten song,long lost,drifting across the tide."
