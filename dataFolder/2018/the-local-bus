Text: "Living out of the bag-pack for extended periods has always been my addiction.\
  \ Leaving everything behind, unlocking new areas on the map, and of course blending\
  \ in with the locals, gives a pleasure ecstasy cannot match. That was precisely\
  \ the objective when i started out on a journey from the southern-most tip of India\
  \ to Kathmandu. It was a challenging feat. \n\nI was behind schedule by a couple\
  \ hours(thanks to Indian Railways) when i reached the India-Nepal border. Having\
  \ caught a taxi from Gorakhpur,India along with some Indian military personal on\
  \ vacation, i was briefed on what to expect while crossing border as an Indian citizen,\
  \ they said there was absolutely nothing to worry about. I Set foot in Nepal at\
  \ sharp 01:00 and realized  there was no proper transportation available till early\
  \ morning. A friendly local then approached me saying i can rest at his home for\
  \ the night, with a chilled beer if i wanted to, in exchange for some Indian Rupees.\
  \ He also advised it is better to leave for Pokhara first and from there to Kathmandu.\
  \ I visited my potential haven for the night and having got some good vibes, i opened\
  \ my beer. \n\n4 am. The friendly neighborhood Nepali came knocking and informed\
  \ the first bus is about to leave. I got ready in a jiffy and thus the long bumpy\
  \ ride to Pokhara started.\nIt was almost mid-day when the bus reached its destination.\
  \ I took a taxi down to the lake around which the town stood picturesquely. The\
  \ next step was to find a nice warm nest. My strategy is to never book online, bit\
  \ risky but often exponentially fruitful. After an hour on the street, surviving\
  \ encounters with all types of dealers, i finally found someone trustworthy. He\
  \ offered a spectacular view 'plus what ever i wanted'(which was what caught my\
  \ eye :D ). And believe me i was not disappointed. Through my window frame i could\
  \ see people paragliding all day which i enjoyed watching while getting ready for\
  \ the road ahead.\n\nHaving rented a bike from the town, I decided to ride to a\
  \ remote 'kali' temple where some grand festival is going on (I got this news from\
  \ a grandpa over lunch). And off i went, through hills and valleys where the roads\
  \ twisted and turned for over 150 Kms before i reached my destination. Having driven\
  \ through several 'not so busy' towns earlier, I was expecting a 'not so extravagant'\
  \ festival but boy i was wrong! All those towns were empty because everyone was\
  \ here! It was such a vivid experience and i will be sharing it another day! peace\
  \ out."
