Text: "As I walked toward him, he smiled brightly and said, \"I'm sorry, Honeeey.\
  \ You can shoot me here. And here.\" He gestured to each sun-kissed cheek with his\
  \ slender fingers. I laughed and told my new Parisian friend that it's rude to be\
  \ late. I gave him bisous on the same cheeks he had pointed to moments ago. He knew\
  \ it was both a greeting and a sign of forgiveness. Then we walked hand in hand\
  \ to his white motorcycle parked on a busy boulevard in Montparnasse. \n\nWe had\
  \ met the week prior at the Bal des Pompiers, a party thrown by the local firehouse\
  \ in honor of Bastille Day. I was sipping my champagne when his dark eyes met mine\
  \ across the room. Time stood still. \n\nAn \u201Cenchant\xE9\u201D turned into\
  \ a waltz which turned into plans. He said he knew he had to see this \u201Ccrazy\
  \ girl\u201D again when he spotted me dancing in the rain. \n\nDays later, a sunny\
  \ afternoon found us at a caf\xE9. While people shuffled past, he ran his hand through\
  \ his salt and pepper hair and asked: \n\n\"When we first meet, did you feel...like...when\
  \ you look in someone's eyes...\u201D \n\nI searched his face. \n\n\u201CWell, I\
  \ forget my words,\" he sighed.  \n\n\"A connection?\" I asked. \n\n\"Yes! A connection.\"\
  \ \n\nI told him that I did. He grinned. \"I felt a connection, too.\" \n\nAnd now\
  \ he was assisting me with a helmet that was too big. I awkwardly pulled it into\
  \ place and hesitated. I had never been on a motorcycle, much less in Paris with\
  \ a man I knew for such a short time. As someone who always follows the rules, I\
  \ decided to be daring for once and hopped on. \n\nHe maneuvered into traffic and\
  \ off we went! Eventually, I relaxed my suffocating grip on his waist. The thrill\
  \ of the wind and the colorful Monet-like blur of the shops and caf\xE9s delighted\
  \ my senses. I breathed an intoxicating mix of his cologne and his favorite brand\
  \ of cigarettes as we cruised under a cotton candy pink sky, my teal skirt blowing\
  \ in the wind. We stopped at a red light by the Palais Garnier. He noticed that\
  \ my hands were ice cold and put his gloves on them before patting my knee in reassurance.\
  \ After our sunset tour, he rushed me home under the twinkling lights of the city\
  \ to make my midnight curfew. We ran to the front door with only a minute to spare,\
  \ our laughter echoing down the avenue. He gave my hand a quick kiss as one of the\
  \ nuns clicked the front door shut. \n\nI skipped up the dark staircase thinking\
  \ how nervous I had been to come to Paris alone. But by taking a chance, I got to\
  \ meet a perfect stranger who became \U0001D635\U0001D629\U0001D626 perfect stranger."
