Text: 'It was another day in our small trip to Brussels. I went the three friends
  between university exams and was our first trip together. The city is enchanted
  and not only because of the delicious chocolates (and their smell) but for me it
  was like a golden city, every place you pass by has some secrets and its lovely
  how you get inside and feels like becomes part of you. After seeing the Grand Place
  we went to different streets and just walk without destination, the only goal was
  find someting new that wasn''t in the maps, something that only the people who lived
  there know. Well let me already day that happened. We get lost and was obvious that
  it would happen because we only had the traditional map. We thought that was fine
  and we could go back but well, I must say that my orientation isn''t good. After
  some time we found a simple restaurant and we asked how we can go back. The people
  were so kind that we actually stop to eat. But more than that. They were so lovely
  that we told us some old stories about that neighborhood like who used to live there,
  the most famous chocolate in Brussels, how people do it, the traditions, how the
  older ones use to spend their time. I can say that we walked there as strangers
  and left as friends. They gave us tips of what to do, where to go and more than
  that, what I really search for: some personal histories of them and places that
  they love, as belgians. That''s what matter the most in every journey I take: the
  feeling of knowing more. More of the world, more of the humanity by meeting people
  from different places and different ponts of view. That''s the main point of travelling,
  for me.'
