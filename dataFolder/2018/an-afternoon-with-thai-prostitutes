Text: "A number of years ago I went to Bangkok to get my wisdom teeth removed, dental\
  \ work is so much cheaper in Thailand than Australia.\nIt was my last day, I was\
  \ flying out at midnight, I thought I would go to the local bar for some lunch and\
  \ a quiet beer, before heading back to my room to have a nap before my flight.\n\
  I know how a couple of beers can quickly turn into too many beers, so I took just\
  \ enough money, so that I would not be tempted to overindulge. \nSo I ordered my\
  \ lunch and a beer, and say quietly waiting for my order to arrive. \nI was the\
  \ only person in the bar as it was quite early in the day. Many tourists don\u2019\
  t venture out until late afternoon, particularly on warmer days...\nBefore I know\
  \ it I three prostitutes had joined me.\nOne spoke excellent English and worked\
  \ as a translator for the other two.\nIt was quite possibly one of my profound travel\
  \ experiences. \nEach of the girls told me their tragic stories of falling in love\
  \ with western men who promised them the world - love, marriage, a home in Europe\
  \ - but then packed up and left. Never to be heard from again.  It was only then\
  \ that these women realised they had been taken for a proverbial ride. And thus\
  \ began their downward spirals into the Bangkok life of prostitution.\nAlthough\
  \ it was very sad, I felt honoured to have their stories shared with me... when\
  \ in Thailand you see these women and girls everywhere, one cannot help but wonder\
  \ how they end up in these situations. To have the opportunity to actually sit and\
  \ listen to these women was amazing!\nWhat started out as a quiet afternoon turned\
  \ into an epic session with three beautifully tragic women. They kept my beer glass\
  \ full for the next few hours.\nMy quiet afternoon was not such a quiet one. But\
  \ it was truly unforgettable!"
