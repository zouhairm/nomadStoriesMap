Text: "\u201CIf he finds out you\u2019re a foreigner, you can get in trouble\u201D\
  \ was one of the first warnings I received before ordering a cab in Buenos Aires.\
  \ \u201CI would like to go to Callao\u201D, I told the driver in Spanish while getting\
  \ into the car. \u201CWhere??\u201D he replied. After repeating it a couple of times\
  \ he finally understood. \u201COh you meant \u2018Cajjao\u2019!! Where\u2019re you\
  \ from?\u201D\nDamn. I had not spent 2 minutes in the cab and he already knew I\
  \ wasn\u2019t from here. For anyone familiar with the Spanish pronunciation, the\
  \ \u2018ll\u2019 can greatly vary from country to country. I had said it like a\
  \ Spaniard. In Argentina, it can be pronounced anything from \u201Cj\u201D to \u201C\
  sh\u201D.\nStill, this piece of advice echoes a main concern locals have in big\
  \ cities: insecurity.\n\u201CHow did you get back home yesterday night? texted me\
  \ once an Argentinian friend.\n-By train, I replied.\n-At what time?\nAt what time?\n\
  At what time?\n-At 10pm! Is it OK \u201CDaddy\u201D?\n-You\u2019re crazy! Give me\
  \ your mother\u2019s phone. I\u2019m gonna tell her.\u201D\nAlbeit half joking,\
  \ his reaction was one of the many I faced during my stay.\nFrom this fear, incongruous\
  \ jobs emerged as well, like the cuida coche. As their title suggests, they will\
  \ be looking after your car while parked in the street. Whether you like it or not.\
  \ I was always intrigued by these people who expected to be paid for an unwanted\
  \ favor, until I got to hear from one of them. It was one of these hot summer nights,\
  \ when you could tell from the heavy air that a storm was coming up. \"Don\u2019\
  t know if I\u2019m gonna stay here much longer.\u201D He admitted, his hands scrunching\
  \ the bills of pesos I had just given him. Even after working fifteen hours a day,\
  \ he only made $350 a month. \u201CI have a handicapped daughter and with the new\
  \ benefit cuts passed by the government, I can barely make ends meet now.\u201D\
  \ Speechless, I felt helpless in front of this man, who was simply grateful for\
  \ having found someone he could share his burden with, for a moment.\nBut the stories\
  \ don\u2019t stop here. The same taxi driver made a halt to buy me \u201Cthe best\
  \ alfajor (cookie) in town\u201D. The same friend who texte me, told me not to take\
  \ the train and drove me home the following day. I was told not to ask my way on\
  \ the street, but people spontaneously came to me with a helping hand.\nYes, Argentinians\
  \ live with a constant sword of Damocles hanging over\_their heads - for some it\
  \ is insecurity, for others precariousness \u2013 but  I felt that their sense of\
  \ solidarity and sharing largely make up for it."
