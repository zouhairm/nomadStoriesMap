Text: "I'm sitting in the window sill of a third floor apartment overlooking the old\
  \ city of Ohrid and the largest lake I've ever seen, and rain is falling on the\
  \ red-tiled rooves of the old buildings below.\nI'm thinking about our recent and\
  \ very different stay in Lokvitsa, a small almost fossilised village in the mountains\
  \ where we made two new friends, both whom touched me deeply in their gifts of welcome\
  \ and community.\nA taxi took us up the last little winding track to Lokvitsa.\n\
  The departure of the populace, to the cities, Europe and even Australia has resulted\
  \ in crumbling stone buildings suffering a takeover by the forest.\nWe stayed in\
  \ a house built by my partner Miki's ancestors and still held in the family, an\
  \ old stone, mud and hardwood structure with a mud floor, no electricity and a huge\
  \ overgrown vine where the pit toilet used to be.\nThe buildings of Lokvitsa in\
  \ their disrepair have taken on a artful chaos of leaning stone walls, reminiscent\
  \ of doll houses with walls missing revealing the life that was lived here. Fertile\
  \ soil is still manured and tilled by stubborn old peasants.\nWe saw him as we drove\
  \ in, and asked an old lady about him. He's just the village dog, she said.\nHe\
  \ warmed to us and we to him. He took it upon himself to show us around his village,\
  \ never far from us as we meandered through the ghostly world of Lokvitsa. We fed\
  \ him salami, pate and bread and named him Aussie. \nWe walked past a well kept\
  \ 'bafcha' (garden) with a stable attached and a cow bellowing somewhere within.\
  \ A lady stood on the step and as she beckoned we stood to have a conversation.\
  \ \nHer name was Nada and she introduced herself, as is customary in Macedonia as\
  \ Baba Nada (grandmother). She was born in Lokvitsa and despite moving to Skopje\
  \ for some time she had lived there again for 20 years. She declared an interest\
  \ in worldly things and something about her told me that she might have loved a\
  \ more diverse life than a village one. But she loves it and would never leave.\n\
  As we left Lokvitsa today on our way to Ohrid, I held Aussie's head resisting the\
  \ urge to give his mangy body a full on cuddle. I hope someone takes him in next\
  \ winter, or he finds a ruin to ride out the cold in. Baba Nada was picking some\
  \ greenery off the curb at the entrance to the village as the van took us away and\
  \ she waved until she was out of sight to us. A tear and a tiny piece of my heart\
  \ remains in a dear little disappearing place called Lokvitsa."
