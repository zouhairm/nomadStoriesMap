Text: "It was years since I'd seen any family and now my sister awaited my arrival\
  \ in LA. After months on the road in Central America, I approached the border control\
  \ where I had visualized a flawless crossing thanks to my New Zealand Passport.\
  \ Unfortunately the pages neglected to present an exit stamp from my layover in\
  \ Miami and the documents with proof of where I had been seemed irrelevant, with\
  \ the officer adamant in not letting me through. I was to be escorted out by security\
  \ and literally thrown out of America.\n\nI crossed the Tijuana River to be violently\
  \ pulled into an alley. Two cops now had my pack with my passport. Everything was\
  \ pulled out and a bag of white powder appeared out of nowhere. \u201CWhat\u2019\
  s this?\u201D he said. \u201CYou tell me?\u201D I replied \u201Cit came from you.\u201D\
  \ I was determined to not part with a cent and I was struggling to keep my composure.\
  \ Miraculously the cop\u2019s attitude turned to sympathy after hearing me out and\
  \ I left unscathed.  \nI entered a dive bar and surveyed the tables in search for\
  \ some much needed company. I approached a table with four girls to a warm welcome.\
  \ The girls were students from San Diego taking advantage of age laws and prices.\
  \ It was a much needed session with awesome company in a dire situation. The night\
  \ progressed from beers to Tequila and an offer was put out to smuggle me across\
  \ the border in the boot of their car. I was desperate but common sense prevailed.\
  \ I lay in bed with the ceiling fan cranked. The feeling of the booze wore off,\
  \ confidence turned to anxiety and the after taste of tequila brought the taste\
  \ of regret, but it was time for one last attempt. \n\nAt the control, I scanned\
  \ the layout to be presented with fresh faces all around. A guy approached me appearing\
  \ empathetic of nature and on presenting my documents assured me that he could not\
  \ see any problems. He directed me to a counter and visa processing began. He took\
  \ my prints and the deal was done, but first I was directed to pay a processing\
  \ fee. It was the guy that shafted me yesterday and was so determined not to let\
  \ me through, surely he would protest and make a scene, but he didn\u2019t. He avoided\
  \ all eye contact and handed me my passport. I thanked him and made my way toward\
  \ Hollywood. \n\nOn the bus and emotionally drained I drifted into a deep sleep.\
  \ I walked along Hollywood Boulevard observing the famous names passing beneath.\
  \ It was only the shadow of the oncoming person that stopped me from walking directly\
  \ into them. I looked up and it was my sister."
