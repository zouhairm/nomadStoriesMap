Text: "Pulling up to Ernakulam train station in a tuk-tuk, in a post overnight bus\
  \ slump with 13 hours to wait for my next venture, I was dreary eyed and anxious\
  \ to rest. My attempts to ask the tuk-tuk driver to wait for me seemed fruitless,\
  \ exasperation quickly set in. Little did I know that I would learn one of the most\
  \ significant lessons I have had on my travels that day.\n \n\u201CMam, can I help?\u201D\
  \ came the voice of an older man from outside. \u201CTuk-tuks cannot wait here,\
  \ please come, I will help you.\u201D\n \nI was skeptical as to why this man was\
  \ so willing to help. However, I knew navigating through a busy Indian train station\
  \ at 9am with a massive bag in tow, would be complicated enough. I was grateful\
  \ for the assistance.\n \nThe man rushed inside beckoning me to follow him, weaving\
  \ in and out of the busy crowds with ease. I ran behind him, bumping into one person\
  \ after the other, in my attempt to keep up. Finally we reached the ticket office\
  \ and of course, typical of India, rather then a line, crowds charged the office\
  \ windows.  \u201CCome\u201D he said, \u201CI will buy your ticket\u201D. Again,\
  \ a wave of skepticism washed over me but I decided to trust him. He was a very\
  \ friendly man, with a kind face. I could tell he meant no harm.\n \nAs we left\
  \ the station, he began to speak to me about politics, culture, his family and the\
  \ history of India. I was fascinated by his stories.\n \n \u201CWhat will you do\
  \ for the day mam\u201D he asked. I explained that I would find a place to sit and\
  \ read. Immediately he jumped at the chance to show me some hospitality and offered\
  \ to give me a tour of his hometown. As I accepted his offer he said to me \u201C\
  why do you trust me?\u201D I couldn\u2019t answer. I wasn\u2019t entirely sure.\
  \ Intuition\u2026 instincts\u2026 heart\u2026 all gave me warm reassurance.\n \n\
  Sure enough, we went on an adventure for the day. He drove me around Cochin and\
  \ Fort Cochin, we went for walks, listened to Indian music loudly and he gave me\
  \ the lowdown on the history of the town. His wife, who had been expecting us, had\
  \ prepared a delicious Indian banquet for us. We spent the day deep in conversation.\
  \ \n \nAs he took me onto my train later that evening, he shyly whispered \u201C\
  I love you friend\u201D and ran off the carriage before I could even say good bye.\
  \ It left me with a warm but sad heart because in that moment I felt I loved him\
  \ too and I knew I would never see him again.\n \nThough taking risks while traveling\
  \ is not always safe, sometimes wonders can happen. By taking a risk that day, I\
  \ was reminded of the underlying beauty of humanity."
