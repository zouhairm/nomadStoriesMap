Text: "-Would ya\xB4like a pint, miss? - The bartender yelled into my ears.\n \n-Just\
  \ coffee, please.\n \nFew things beat the sensual thrill of Irish music, and dance,\
  \ in a local, Irish, pub.   \nWooden tables, wet and dark, vibrating with clicking\
  \ glasses outpouring with golden liquid.\nThe stage, in flames, with long legged\
  \ dancers kicking the air, hands glued to their hips, competing with gusto.\n\n\
  The bartender took my order, winked, and asked if I was a dancer. \n\n- How do you\
  \ know?\n \n-Aw, sure look it. You\xB4ll get ossified up there, ye\xB4ll see. \n\
  \ \nBefore I knew it, I was on stage, jumping with a broomstick, pretending I knew\
  \ what I was doing, making a (happy) monkey out of myself.\n \n-Jesus fecking Ch\xB4\
  rist. - The crowd shouted, in unison. \n\nI left Dublin after lunch - stew and chips\
  \ - and arrived to Tullamore, in the Offaly county, heart of Ireland.\n \n-C\xE9\
  ad m\xEDle f\xE1ilte (a hundred thousand welcomes, in Gaelic language)! - Dudley,\
  \ my host, greeted me as we glided through the castle\xB4s main gate. \n \nThe place\
  \ felt like a movie set: an eerie, dark, Gothic castle built in 1641 over a Druid\
  \ cemetery. \n \nI was invited into my room, improvised in one of the vigil towers,\
  \ a cosy space with a high five pointed star ceiling; red walls, a fireplace, a\
  \ chandelier so heavy it threatened to fall on your head, and cracked vintage mirrors\
  \ that transported you back in time. I was in love and exhausted. Off to sleep.\
  \ \n \nSomeone tapped me on the head while I was sleeping. I woke up and saw a man\
  \ who looked like a Jewish rabbi. We talked and laughed together. A little girl\
  \ named Harriet, the daughter of the third Earl of Charleville, who died in the\
  \ main staircase of the castle at the age of 8 in 1861, followed; last, but not\
  \ the least, a man who wanted attention. Just a bit of attention.\nThey were not\
  \ alive, not the way I was, at least, but they went on living.\n \nI rose up, the\
  \ next day, with a new, life-altering, certainty - our souls live on - and questions\
  \ no wise person could answer.\nThere is a life before, and after, that night at\
  \ the castle. I believe that is what traveling does to you: it opens you up; it\
  \ changes your life.\n \nTraveling is not about margaritas by the swimming pool.\
  \ It is about curiosity; the incomprehensible, the mystery. It is about living fully,\
  \ keeping the innocence of our heart, aka childish curiosity, alive; leaving no\
  \ stone unturned. It is about discovering, and rediscovering, who we are.\n \nTraveling\
  \ is living when surviving is not enough. And it is never enough."
