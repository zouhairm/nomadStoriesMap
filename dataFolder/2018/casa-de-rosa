Text: "Perspiration glues me to the coated wooden stool a race of sweat competing\
  \ down the middle of my back. Fried oil fills the thick air as I wait for my 'desayuno\
  \ typico' praying I get used to the humidity here. Remembering the burnt red skies\
  \ encompassing yesterday's sunset, I gaze through the opening in the disjointed\
  \ tin roof at the local market. \nBreakfast appears like a mirage I eat hastily,\
  \ dousing hot sauce on to 'huevos' and batting away flies that use my plate as a\
  \ playground.\nWith hunger tamed I enter back onto the chaotic small town roads.\
  \ Motor vehicles noisily pass in contradicting directions, I navigate the unevenly\
  \ paved sidewalks which cause more injury than walking in the road. \nI approach\
  \ a wooden pink hand painted sign 'Rosa Silva Spanish School'. It's the discovery\
  \ of this unassuming treasure that combines lessons and homestay with Rosa herself.\
  \ \nThe classes blossom beyond the stereotypical sessions, becoming interpersonal\
  \ and authentic as the weeks go by. \nMy evenings convert to delicious home cooked\
  \ meals, far away from a sub-standard serving of 'pintos y arroz' that you receive\
  \ in many hostels. Vibrant 'rico' dishes with flavours dancing on my tongue. \n\
  When we tour the walkable town I'm introduced to the Church goers, shop owners and\
  \ taxi drivers. Rosa has stories on them all and we become each other's verbal diary.\
  \ She is a free spirited enigma head and heart far from here, not totally rid of\
  \ the Catholic religion but more spiritually natured. We share impressions of the\
  \ warped world we exist in and often mirror each other's thoughts. I feel warmth\
  \ that's not the climate air but human kinship.\n\nLeaving her casa for the last\
  \ time, I am met with the accustomed sound of bellowing voices. Men selling 'Aguacate\
  \ y Platano' violently disturbing the peace with their repetitive barks followed\
  \ by the aggressive beeping of vehicle horns ripping through my morning calm. \n\
  Arriving at the converted American school buses spitting out polluted phlegm, no\
  \ intention of moving soon. I witness people cramming onto the buses that are beginning\
  \ to pull away luggage flung on top, dogs and children carried on hips. Backpackers\
  \ being hurried into the back trying to determine their destination and trying a\
  \ hand at haggling a fare. \nI join them.\nBreathing in memories of the last few\
  \ months faces flash in my head, Rosa's radiates of course. Our hearty connection\
  \ trickles through my veins entering a communal artery. A foreign love beats on."
