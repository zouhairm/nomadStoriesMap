Text: "The word that can describe the first time I met the Ice Capped peaks of The\
  \ Almighty Canadian Rockies is \u201CEuphoria\u201D!\nThe last thing I expected\
  \ that I am about to embark on a 10 hours journey, overcoming one of the top 20\
  \ most thrilling hiking trails in the world. The Crypt Lake Trail is in Waterton\
  \ Lakes National Park in Alberta, Canada. 17kms that progressively climb up, and\
  \ after passing through a hanging valley in the mountains,I started hearing the\
  \ waterfalls and creeks, and I stopped feeling the pain. Thinking \u201CI am just\
  \ about to see massive waterfalls\u201D,as I heard an announcement that the hardest\
  \ part of this hike is about to begin. Gasping for air, I got worried whether I\
  \ will be able to maintain my balance on this steep cliff till the end!\nAs the\
  \ sun gets harsher, steps get bigger, and rocks are unsteady and too big to ignore.\
  \ Concentrating on every step I took on this trail. I couldn\u2019t enjoy the views\
  \ around me, focused on not slipping, getting injured, or causing harm to others.As\
  \ I walk up I realized I am running short on water, but the light breeze that was\
  \ travelling through the pine trees, spraying their scent, kept me cool for a while!\n\
  We crawled through a natural tunnel for nearly 100ft, before seeing the stunning,\
  \ bright turquoise colored water (Crypt Lake). At 2300 elevation gain, I laid there\
  \ on my back resting my feet, amazed with this magnificent view of the coupled peaks.\
  \ \u201CI made it; I just reached a new height\u201D. My feet were numb after 6\
  \ hours of force, I dipped them in the water, and I couldn\u2019t keep them in there\
  \ for more than 3 seconds. This is glacier water, glaciers melted during the summer\
  \ from the surrounding peaks, feeding the waterfalls that we saw on our way up.\n\
  We had to start making our way down; the concern was catching the ferry that will\
  \ take us back to our campground. Before arriving to the ferry dock, I fell on my\
  \ knees, beaten and thirsty, I couldn\u2019t walk anymore. My ankles were heavy\
  \ as a rock. My hip joints were depleted; I was in tremendous pain that I lost sight\
  \ of where I was. I cried as I felt heavier without any water to thicken the blood\
  \ running through my veins. A person behind me mentioned it, as he passes by me\
  \ in a hurry, if I decide to take longer crying, I will be sleeping here without\
  \ any gear in this bear land, I will be missing the only ferry that runs for the\
  \ day.\nRelieved as I reached the bottom; a sense of victory turned today to be\
  \ unforgettable. I realized that fear is only there to be conquered!"
