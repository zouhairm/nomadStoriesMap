Text: "There are moments of clarity in life that changes everything. Growing up I\
  \ wanted to travel without a plan - just keep going without any destination, meeting\
  \ people on the way, listen to their stories and tell them mine while sharing whatever\
  \ food was available. But life has a way of changing course. I fell in love pretty\
  \ early in life and decided to marry her after dating for 10 years. Life was good\
  \ - I'd a loving family, my childhood sweetheart who was my wife now and a good\
  \ job that I tolerated. I would keep thinking about my childhood dreams every now\
  \ and then but it seemed to be getting further away. \nIn December 2017, I found\
  \ out that my wife was having an affair with her best friend and probably never\
  \ loved me. After the initial shock, I started the paperwork for a divorce. As I\
  \ lay completely shattered and broken, I found that my dream felt much closer now.\
  \ I did not have any obligations, no one to come home to and no one waiting for\
  \ me. That was my moment of clarity. \nOver the years I had fallen in love with\
  \ motorcycle riding & I decided to ride from Bombay to the south of India. I did\
  \ my research about couch surfing & found that people are genuinely nice and helpful.\
  \ I started riding on the 3rd of January 2018. Its been almost 2 months now and\
  \ I have just reached Kerala. I rode through the twisty roads in the ghats of Lonavla,\
  \ the straight roads of Belgaum, the crazy traffic of Bangalore & the hairpin bends\
  \ of Virajpet. I stopped at places I felt like, I slept in my sleeping bag under\
  \ trees, in temple compounds, with people who would offer me the couch and just\
  \ travelled without a care in the world. I would engage people and ask them for\
  \ work in exchange for a hot meal. More often than not, people would happily invite\
  \ me over and just ask me to help out on the farms or just a little bit of cleaning\
  \ up. I avoided the cities and stuck mostly in and around the rural areas as I found\
  \ people to be more helpful.\nI think my journey has just started and I am now planning\
  \ to go to the southernmost tip of India (Kanyakumari) and then ride to the northern\
  \ tip of India (Indira Col) and meet more random people on the way. 3 months ago\
  \ you couldn't have paid me enough to leave my (ex) wife and go on a trip and now\
  \ you can't pay me enough to put the anchor down on my trip. I have found the adventure\
  \ in my life and I have decided to grab it with both hands and never let go. Is\
  \ it making me money? No. Is it making me happy? Hell YES! This is my moment of\
  \ clarity!"
