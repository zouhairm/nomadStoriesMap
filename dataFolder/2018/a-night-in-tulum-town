Text: "I did not like him at first. Alberto was different than the other Spanish teachers\
  \ at the school I was attending in Tulum, Mexico. While most of the teachers exuded\
  \ joy during the Spanish classes that took place outside, under a breezy palapa\
  \ in the jungle, Alberto was more serious and professorial. It wasn\u2019t until\
  \ the night of the soccer game that I thought otherwise.\n\nOn a warm, sticky evening\
  \ just before sunset, I met a collection of Spanish school teachers, their children,\
  \ and my fellow classmates at a large sports field in Tulum. Due to my lack of soccer\
  \ skills, I played the goalie. Despite being terrified each time the ball approached,\
  \ I managed to dive and block the ball when it was kicked hard at the goal. I was\
  \ slowly standing up after scraping my legs on the pebble-covered dirt, when I heard\
  \ everyone on my team cheering \u201CPortero!, Portero!, Portero!\u201D Alberto\
  \ was standing nearby and explained that \u201Cportero\u201D means \u201Cgoalie\u201D\
  \ in Spanish, and he was impressed with my block. I grinned.  \n\nTo celebrate the\
  \ game, the Spanish teachers took us to a local restaurant known for its tacos al\
  \ pastor. The pork meat with pineapple is grilled on a flaming spit at the front\
  \ of the restaurant. After the waiter served us the tacos on plastic plates, Alberto\
  \ explained that you choose from various condiments at a side table, including limes,\
  \ onions, and salsas. He warned me that one of the salsas is extremely \u201Cpicante,\u201D\
  \ and there had been unfortunate mix-ups among tourists in the past.  \n\nAs we\
  \ ate, Alberto and I discussed our lives with my limited Spanish. He told me how\
  \ he had left his hometown of Cuernavaca, about 1,000 miles away near Mexico City,\
  \ for this job several months ago, but his wife and son were still there. Alberto\
  \ was not sure when they would be able to join him in Tulum. I realized that what\
  \ I had taken as seriousness, was a kind of sadness. When some classmates decided\
  \ to meet later that night at a local bar in town, I immediately invited Alberto.\
  \  \n\nWhen we met at the bar, salsa music was thumping, and I saw various people\
  \ young and old, local and foreign, dancing and drinking out in the street. Alberto\
  \ had put on a nice white button-down shirt and seemed excited to be out. A few\
  \ mezcal drinks later, and the whole group was dancing in a circle, laughing and\
  \ clapping our hands to the beat, just happy to be alive. We ended up at a late-night\
  \ taco stand, regaling in stories about our soccer match. My eyes met Alberto\u2019\
  s, and I glimpsed a genuine smile."
