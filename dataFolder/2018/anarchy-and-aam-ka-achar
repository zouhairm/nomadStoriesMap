Text: "It is a truth universally acknowledged that a single woman in possession of\
  \ a good fortune must be in search of an adventure. Alright, maybe not. How about,\
  \ \"When in doubt, follow your nose\"?\nTravel can be trying-it forces you to acknowledge\
  \ the universality of human emotions. If you care to look, and follow your ears\
  \ as well as your nose, you might learn that something familiar is to be found even\
  \ in the most distant shores - after all, the same 7 notes of music make up songs,\
  \ no matter the language. That we feel tastes just the same - the bitterness of\
  \ coffee, the pungency of freshly peeled garlic.\n\"Bhava\", its called in Hindi.\
  \ Emotions. Indian dance terms, but they manage to describe food and life all at\
  \ once. And sometimes, bhava is all that you remember after the journey is over.\
  \ \nI remember the sky as a deep rust, which I could see from my airplane window.\
  \ I don't remember who sat next to me, but I remember her smelling of cucumbers.\
  \ It was my first time in Costa Rica, and I remember, very vividly, feeling the\
  \ need to make the most of my time -so pressing that I felt I had to start by taking\
  \ it all in even before the airplane landed, so I pressed  my face to the Plexiglass\
  \ and observed the sky and mountain tops that the airport seemed to cut through.\
  \ \n\"Make friends with taxi drivers\" -so I found myself, on his recommendation,\
  \ at an open air market -the fragrance of meat grilling and a song blaring off a\
  \ sound system as old as me - I was in a dusty pueblo with no pin code, and was\
  \ famished. Of course, I followed my nose, and the music. A mass of curly black\
  \ hair- and, mangoes. The mangoes brought me home. The mass of black hair was to\
  \ bring me on to my next journey. Zangaria was a mango farmer and flamenco teacher.\
  \ Kathak and flamenco are sisters separated at birth. Serendipitous that I, a kathak\
  \ dancer, would meet Zangaria, a flamenco dancer. And that day, I learnt that it\
  \ wouldn't hurt to perhaps follow the music too. \nI followed the music with Zangaria\
  \ over the next 6months - at gatherings of flamenco dancers, small concert halls\
  \ in towns whose names I now forget, her mango farm - small, but lush. We made salsa\
  \ and aam ka achaar, the juices dripping off our elbows, bright yellow turmeric\
  \ mixing with the chilies, the lilting twang of a flamenco guitar and the sunset\
  \ behind the mountaintops. This is what they spoke of, when they spoke of \"bhava\"\
  . I do not remember her house anymore. All I remember is the sweetness of the music,\
  \ and the mangoes."
