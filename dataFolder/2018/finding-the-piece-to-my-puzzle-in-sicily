Text: "Last August I embarked on an adventure that changed the core of my very existence.\
  \ I spent 18 days backpacking through 8 different cities within Italy. The path\
  \ that led me to Sicily began before I was old enough to walk. \n\nAs a child I\
  \ latched on to my favorite grandparent, my Nono (grandpa in Italian). He brought\
  \ color to my life when he would speak about his adventurous childhood in Sicily.\
  \ When I was 8 years old he made me a promise, and I never let him forget about\
  \ it. \n\n\"Nina, one day when you are old enough, I promise to take you to Sicily.\
  \ You can ride the donkey's and see the farm where I grew up.\" \n- G. Perrone\n\
  \nUnfortunately, we never made the trip.\n\nYears later, I decide it is time to\
  \ book the trip I have always dreamt about. \nFollow me along as I take a voyage\
  \ back in time. \n\nAugust 28th, 2017\n\nI just flew into Palermo, Sicily and I'm\
  \ hopping on the first bus headed to San Vito Lo Capo. San Vito is a small beach\
  \ city consisting of maybe 5 to 6 streets. During the day the beach is lined all\
  \ the way down with colorful umbrellas and overly tanned Italians.\n\nThe sun is\
  \ shining down on me as I dance in the shallow ocean waters. This Italian woman\
  \ smiles from ear to ear as she comes over to me. She doesn't speak a lick of English,\
  \ but I am able to hold a very light conversation with her. \n\nMartina is from\
  \ Palermo, and she is on a day vacation by herself. She enjoys this beach more than\
  \ the one in Palermo. She loves to cook, and she likes watching me dance. \n\nAs\
  \ the sun is setting I head out for dinner. As I walk around the city, the night\
  \ comes alive. The midnight market vendors pop up their tents and start selling\
  \ their goods. Music is playing, and people begin dancing in the middle of the street.\
  \ Kids run around and hop on any available donkey ride. Nonos' are sitting outside\
  \ in their chairs laughing away, and I start missing my Nono. Up until this trip\
  \ I was never given the opportunity to truly know my families' heritage, and I've\
  \ always felt as though I was missing a piece of myself.\n\nI was walking along\
  \ and suddenly I stop dead in my tracks. I see a sign on a building that says, \"\
  Perrone Store, this way\". This happens to be my Nono's surname. I can't believe\
  \ that this is actually happening! For all I know, the store's owner could be some\
  \ distant relative I've never met. \n\nHere I stand in Sicily, this is where my\
  \ family comes from. \n\nThis is me! \n\nThe last thing I ever expected was to finally\
  \ find the missing piece to my puzzle."
