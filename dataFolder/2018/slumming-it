Text: "I\u2019m sitting at a laminated plywood table on a rickety plastic chair. Strip\
  \ lighting puts everyone off ease, except Damian, who is yet to arrive. Awaiting\
  \ him are two Porte\xF1a ladies (in pearls, cardigans and tailored trousers), Vicky\
  \ (an eco-warrior yoga teacher), George (a journalist from east London) and me (a\
  \ curious traveller).\n\nSmall talk waning, Damian finally arrives in paint-stained\
  \ dungarees and an Afghan scarf. His belly falls over the sweater that he ties around\
  \ his waist as he sits down. He greets each of us in turn, smiling broadly with\
  \ his two chins. \n\nDamian is a muralist and revolutionary. He lives, works and\
  \ breathes Buenos Aires\u2019s slums and he was born in one, too. Typified by drugs,\
  \ crime and violence these communities reside outside state control. However, several\
  \ organisations have made inroads into these worlds: Evangelistas, Peronistas and\
  \ a handful of NGOs. Damian works with the former two. Mixing faith and politics\
  \ in his pallet.\n\nGeorge and I decide to spend the following Saturday accompanying\
  \ Damian on his rounds.\n\nBefore entering the first slum Damian instructs us to\
  \ keep our mouths shut. He is on edge as we walk down the street, where Bolivian\
  \ Cumbia music blares obliviously out of every other home. Our foreignness makes\
  \ us targets, with our white skin and patchy Spanish we\u2019ve cause to feel fearful,\
  \ so we follow silently as Damian recounts the hardships that he\u2019s encountered\
  \ and the horrors that he's seen: a pre-adolescent girl giving a blow job to a man\
  \ in the street in exchange for a cigarette, children giving birth, the destruction\
  \ of addiction, glue sniffing and Paco \u2013 a lethal derivative of cocaine that\
  \ can kill users within a year.\n\nFrom 9am-6pm we move from one make-shift church\
  \ to the next. We sing along with infants in a converted shipping container and\
  \ exchange pleasantries with a bright blue-eyed priest. We play dodge-ball under\
  \ a fly-over, colour in pictures crouched around miniature tables and freeze our\
  \ fingers painting Damian\u2019s latest mural with an entourage of little helpers.\n\
  \nDamian paints with acrylics, mixing primary shades to pastel to save a few pennies,\
  \ (white is the cheapest colour). He asks if I know why he uses acrylics. I have\
  \ a guess. Because they're cheap? Apparently not. It's because they aren't toxic,\
  \ so the children can\u2019t sniff them. \n\nEntering Damian's world is full of\
  \ surprises, revolutionary ideals and real life challenges: if one thing is clear,\
  \ it's that the work here is far from done."
