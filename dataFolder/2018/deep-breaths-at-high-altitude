Text: "It was nighttime when I stepped out of the airport and thought I was facing\
  \ the hills of South San Francisco, California. In fact, I was looking at the twinkling\
  \ urban lights sprinkled along the silhouettes of the Andes Mountains. I'd just\
  \ landed at Mariscal Sucre Airport in Quito, Ecuador and was getting a ride with\
  \ cousins I\u2019d become very close to. I was in my mother's home country, her\
  \ birthplace. The vivid memories she and my grandmother shared with me were about\
  \ to come to life.\n \nQuito, the capital of Ecuador, is one of the first World\
  \ Cultural Heritage Sites declared by UNESCO. Quito Viejo or Old Quito is the heart\
  \ of it. What did it look like when the Incas ruled? Stepping into its historic\
  \ center, I was surrounded by Spanish colonial architecture distinct with its dark\
  \ metal awnings and balconies, and brick stucco structures that shaped churches\
  \ and homes. I was walking on the same smooth uneven cobblestones the Spanish colonizers\
  \ laid down in the mid to late 1500s. More than 400 years later my mom walked along\
  \ these same cobblestone streets with her brothers and sisters to go to the market,\
  \ to church, to school. A generation later there I was, first born in the United\
  \ States, walking along my family's footsteps.\n \nThroughout the year the climate\
  \ in Quito is mild and temperate, and in February it felt like a fresh spring day\
  \ with temperatures in the 60s Fahrenheit. The sun was particularly strong and a\
  \ reminder we were practically on the equator. I bought a traditional black fedora\
  \ hat from a Quechua woman who wore the same and had a colorful shawl wrapped around\
  \ her. She held up a mirror while I tried it on and I was struck by the similarities\
  \ reflected back. Like her I had high cheekbones and a wide face. It's one thing\
  \ to blend in with your side of the family back home. It's an entirely different\
  \ thing to see your face fit in like a puzzle piece next to a stranger in a country\
  \ you've never been to.\n \nQuito sits at an altitude of 9,350 feet above sea level.\
  \ Take the Telef\xE9rico to the top of Cruz Loma and you\u2019re over 13,000 feet\
  \ above sea level with a view of one of the most beautiful cities in the world.\
  \ Standing in a cool very quiet wind, I found myself in tears and awe. It wasn\u2019\
  t the altitude that took my breath away but the connection I felt with Quito, and\
  \ the deep pride and gratitude to have roots in such an elegant place. So many of\
  \ us are multicultural, it\u2019s a gift to explore our ancestry, embrace family\
  \ and create new memories."
