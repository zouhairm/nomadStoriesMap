Text: "At this stage in our journey the walking is more methodical than wearisome.\
  \ Megan and I have developed an easy understanding, I walk ahead and wait at designated\
  \ kilometre marks and we sit together sweat soaked under shade. The heat and dust\
  \ in central Thailand had been almost unbearable and the memory of heatstroke still\
  \ lingers. These mountains in Northern Laos are a welcome change, with cool breezes\
  \ coming up to meet our distinct aroma as we walk. \n\nWe almost didn't come this\
  \ way, we only noticed a new road on our maps as we got closer. It seems possible\
  \ to cut through from Napoung direct to Luang Prabang over the mountains. It should\
  \ save us a week's worth of walking, although we aren't too sure what will greet\
  \ us on the road, or if the villages in the mountains will have us stay. We don't\
  \ even know at this point they exist. \n\nThe greenery surrounding us is endless,\
  \ save the savage gash of red earth being cut through the hillsides to make way\
  \ for a new road. The red vein throbbing through the rainforest seems painful, as\
  \ if the mountains are bleeding. There's smoke in the distance and I can see we\
  \ must be getting close to our camp for the night, but I stop short. The road is\
  \ gone. \n\n\"Why have we stopped? Aren't we almost there?\" Megan asked, hair slicked\
  \ to the sides of her face, white shirt made brown in the blood of the road. \n\"\
  Road's gone.\"\n\"Ah. crap.\"\n\"Yeah.\"\n\nWe look around to improvise, but it\
  \ looks like we have to double back a few kilometres. It's bad news, we're 9 hours\
  \ into a tumultuous walk with heavy packs. \n\n\"Wait, there's a small track around\
  \ the side here, we can follow it down to where that section over there has collapsed.\"\
  \ I offer unhelpfully.\n\"Ahh yes, the safe collapsed area, classic.\" Megan says\
  \ deadpan.\n\nWe navigate the area cautiously and manage to make it down to an undamaged\
  \ section of road without fuss. \n\nAs we enter the village we can feel eyes on\
  \ us. We do our best to look unthreatening as we ask where we are able to wash.\
  \ We are directed to a singular tap in an open square in the middle of the shacked\
  \ housing. People are taking turns to bathe themselves. We join the communal bathers\
  \ fully clothed to wash the road blood from our threads. The women laugh and tell\
  \ us to take our clothes off, but we have already made small children cry with our\
  \ pale skin on entering the village and we don't want to cause outright chaos with\
  \ our ghost bodies. \n\nThe red earth returns to the soil as we wash, and we are\
  \ seperate once more."
