Text: "\u201CDo you sell corkscrews?\u201D I asked, while simultaneously pointing\
  \ at the bottle of wine on the counter and miming the action of opening it. I enthusiastically\
  \ twisted the non-existent bottle opener and looked expectantly at the girl behind\
  \ the till. \n\nThe curly-haired cashier gave me a strange look and slowly shook\
  \ her head no. I wasn\u2019t sure if she didn\u2019t understand or if they didn\u2019\
  t sell corkscrews.\nShe rambled off something in French - as if, somehow, my attempt\
  \ at acting hadn\u2019t made it clear that I didn\u2019t speak the language. I stared\
  \ blankly back at her. I tried desperately to search for the words, but my ninth-grade\
  \ French failed me. \n\nShe gave up on trying to communicate with me and I gave\
  \ up on the corkscrew, at least for the time being. I\u2019d have to find one somewhere\
  \ else. \nShe rang through my groceries and handed me the bag with a smile. I stepped\
  \ out of the small grocery store and onto the street. The sun bounced off the pavement\
  \ and the warm air tickled my skin. \n\nMarathon days of exploring Paris and crisscrossing\
  \ the city had left me exhausted. I decided to forego the Louvre and just relax\
  \ for the afternoon. A picnic in the park was the only thing on my agenda.\n\nI\
  \ walked along, scanning storefronts and searching for somewhere that looked like\
  \ they might carry a corkscrew. I stopped in at a few places and repeated my mime\
  \ act. No luck. It boggled my mind that Paris, the city with the highest wine consumption\
  \ rate in the world, wouldn\u2019t have corkscrews on every corner. Reluctantly,\
  \ I gave up my search.\n\nI grabbed my map and wandered the streets until I came\
  \ upon a quiet park. There were couples lounging, groups of friends throwing frisbees,\
  \ and people walking the path that circled the park. I spread my sarong out on the\
  \ green grass, laid back, and promptly fell asleep. It was exactly the kind of day\
  \ I needed.\n\nWhen I awoke, I pulled the food from my bag and started munching,\
  \ still a little disappointed that I couldn't open that wine. I picked up the bottle\
  \ and absent-mindedly perused the label. I glanced at the foil around the top. I\
  \ paused and pulled it closer to my face, inspecting it more intently. \n\nAnd that\u2019\
  s when I realized my mistake. When it suddenly became clear why that cashier seemed\
  \ so confused by my desperation to find a corkscrew.\n\nCould I really have been\
  \ that daft? Could I really have spent half my afternoon wandering around Paris,\
  \ twisting an imaginary corkscrew in random strangers\u2019 faces when all along\u2026\
  .it was a screw cap."
