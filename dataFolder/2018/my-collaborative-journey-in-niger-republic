Text: "Four years ago, I collaborated in a training project as a trainer in Niamey.\
  \ As preparations progressed, my preconceived concerns started creeping in, how\
  \ would I take to a country dominated by Muslims? Our project involved designing\
  \ and delivering range of leadership and management courses to Nigerien trainers\
  \ who would then teach the material to 2,000 employees/volunteers.\nAfter months\
  \ of work the material was translated into French/Arabic. I was nervous arriving\
  \ Niamey, on getting there, my fears subsided. Course delegates were keen to learn\
  \ and appreciated my interactive style over the more didactic style they were used\
  \ to. \nAs I became more familiar with local practices, I got used to holding breaks\
  \ around prayer times and modifying team-building exercises involving physical proximity\
  \ ensuring everyone participated. Majority of delegates were women and wore hijabs\
  \ with brightly-colored clothes, make-ups, and were strong-minded. I soon realized\
  \ that my equating veiled women with oppression were completely unfounded.\nAs rapport\
  \ grew, I refrained from wearing long robe, preferring to adopt open and honest\
  \ dialogue to challenge misconceptions and stereotypes concerning Christians and\
  \ Nigerians. But as my confidence increased, it seemed to become less of an issue.\n\
  After a few weeks, I realized there were many similarities including a dry ironic\
  \ familiar \u201CNigerian\u201D humor and common human values as honesty, openness,\
  \ warmth and kindness.\nThe experience challenged my assumptions and made me more\
  \ aware of unconscious biases. It also reminded me to focus on common ground when\
  \ meeting new people from other countries/cultures; to make an effort to listen\
  \ with an open mind; and to ask questions rather than judging or making comparisons.\n\
  What I enjoyed most about cross-cultural environment is becoming acquainted with\
  \ new cultures and challenging my stereotypes. For everyone who conforms to a stereotype,\
  \ I\u2019m happy to meet another who completely contradicts my preconceived notions.\n\
  Looking four years back, I would conclude that traveling to Niger Republic in that\
  \ collaborative assignment was not only an experience that stressed and stretched\
  \ me to the limit, but a decision that pushed me to the edge and challenged my humanity.\n\
  At World Nomads, I hope to become a part of this dynamic culture which will give\
  \ me a leading edge to work effectively in diverse teams and situations and I believe\
  \ that my distinctiveness will enrich the learning experience of my classmates."
