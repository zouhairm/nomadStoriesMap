Text: "Few years ago I went on a motor-cycle tour in the Western Ghats of southern\
  \ India. It was one of my longest motor-cycle tours and surely, the most memorable\
  \ one! I rode through the paradise of high hills and profound valleys, mighty rocks\
  \ and dense forests and of course, numerous waterfalls. On the way I stopped several\
  \ times to devour the surreal panorama, little knowing that I had lost my companion\
  \ riders. I came to a dead-end with a forest ahead. I took out my mobile; it had\
  \ no cellular network. I was lost! There was no one around and the sun was about\
  \ to set. Panic gripped me. With the nightfall my life would be at the mercy of\
  \ a dark chilly night, a thick forest and the inhuman creatures that dwell within\
  \ it. While I was frantically looking all around for assistance, I heard human voices\
  \ coming from the woods. Voices came closer and finally two little boys and a strikingly\
  \ attractive young woman emerged out of the woods. Arun and Rajesh as the kids introduced\
  \ themselves to me and their mother Parvathi. Being mindful of my situation, they\
  \ took me to their little hut at the end of their village Marayoor.  Parvathi\u2019\
  s husband disappeared two years ago and never returned. Some suspected that he was\
  \ killed in elephant attack while others believed that he fled with another woman.\
  \ Seeing no hope for his return, Parvathi came to stay with her mother along with\
  \ her two children. There was no electricity in their cottage but it was as warm\
  \ as their hearts. I spent the evening listening to many stories of the mountains.\
  \ After dinner, when others fell asleep, Parvathi sat beside me asked about the\
  \ world I came from. The more I told the more she asked. In the faint light of the\
  \ kerosene lantern I saw her eyes lit up in excitement as she listened to me with\
  \ unfazed attention. I could sense an indomitable desire in her to break free from\
  \ the shackles of her mountain life and experience the world that lay below their\
  \ mountains. \n\n\"Can I come with you?\" She asked in almost whispering tone.\n\
  \nI had no answer for that. An awkward silence filled every corner of her half-lit\
  \ cottage. I looked away. She broke the silence with a dry smile and said, \"I better\
  \ live in my mountains. They are beautiful and I can fit in here easily.\"\n\nThe\
  \ next morning she showed me my way. I thanked her for saving my life. That\u2019\
  s the least that I could do. I roared my bike down the hills. \n\nOften in my solitude,\
  \ her voice rings in my ears, \"Can I come with you?\" \n\n\"Yes, you can,\" answers\
  \ my heart."
