Text: "The lush jungles of Vietnam zoomed past me as I bounced up and down a dirt\
  \ road on a rickety moped I had rented, lost and frantic.\nA series of fateful decisions\
  \ had led me to white knuckling through this backcountry like a man possessed: The\
  \ first was stopping to eat some questionable Ph\u1EDF (Vietnamese noodles) and\
  \ the second was trying to take these back roads to a National Park.\nI had stopped\
  \ for a break when the unmistakable kind of rumbling of the stomach we are all horribly\
  \ familiar with doubled me over. I peeled out like I was part of a bank heist, impulsively\
  \ hoping salvation was just around the corner and, coming across nothing, had resolved\
  \ to lurch into the jungle and take whatever nature might give me.\nBut suddenly\
  \ in the distance I saw the blue tip of a building behind a hill. It was a concrete\
  \ production site, and I pulled in at a hard angle, almost skidding. I flung open\
  \ the cracked door of a converted shipping container and 3 men looked up at me in\
  \ shock. I pointed to my stomach and, with as much grace as I could muster, asked\
  \ for a bathroom.\nThey initially laughed but then one of them saw my contorted\
  \ face and jumped up and indicated to follow him. In my frenzied state I pulled\
  \ too hard on the throttle and slammed into a table outside, knocking over everything\
  \ on it and scratching my shin.\nWith blood pouring down my leg, we weaved through\
  \ piles of sand until we got to a barracks where a dozen other men were seated at\
  \ a table. They quickly figured out what was happening and broke out into uproarious\
  \ laughter. I ran to the bathroom and pushing through the door like a fullback only\
  \ to stumble into a swarm of wasps.\nThrough a serious of yogic contortions and\
  \ unwavering discipline I escaped unharmed and was greeted at the table by resounding\
  \ applause. The men urged me to sit down and through huge smiles we tried to communicate\
  \ with each other.\nMy savior, whose name I never did catch, eventually offered\
  \ to guide me back. His English was better than the others and when we reached the\
  \ end of the dirt road tributary, we both got off our bikes and shook hands. He\
  \ wanted to know how I had ended up back there and I tried to tell him. \nIt was\
  \ a strange moment. I wanted to stay and buy him a beer in gratitude. I wanted to\
  \ be able to speak Vietnamese so I could tell him exactly how I ended up at there,\
  \ hear him explain his reaction, and laugh with him about it.\nBut I knew I had\
  \ to go. 15 minutes later, white knuckles and all, I knew I made the right choice."
