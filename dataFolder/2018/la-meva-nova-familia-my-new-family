Text: "I laughed and looked at him. \u201CPapa, it\u2019s not going to fit!\u201D\
  \ I said in English, not having the slightest idea of how to say it in Catalan.\
  \ I think he knew what I was saying, but he made one more attempt to close the hatchback\
  \ of their miniature European car. The latch clicked, and he looked at me, smiling.\
  \ \u201CIt is ok!\u201D\n\nThe last thing that I expected, in these final few weeks\
  \ of a year long transfer to Spain, was to find a new family. Call it a trip, call\
  \ it a move \u2013 what was intended to be permanent had become, sadly, more like\
  \ an extended vacation after my role at my international company was cut. Either\
  \ way, packing up to go back to the U.S. had been a nightmare. My babysitter, Marina,\
  \ had offered her help. \u201CMy parents, they will come and help you,\u201D she\
  \ had said, in her lilting accented English. Marina\u2019s family lived here, in\
  \ Barcelona, on the other side of town. Her mother had occasionally watched my two\
  \ young boys after school when Marina had a conflict with  university. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure that I believed her, but we set up time the next weekend for them to stop\
  \ by.\n\nMarina and her family held us together that month. They took charge of\
  \ everything. Mama helped clean. Papa disassembled. Marina ran the boys in circles,\
  \ keeping them entertained while their world was packed up for shipping and giving\
  \ away. Papa took away load after load of my secondhand furniture and now-useless\
  \ European appliances in his tiny Opel to some magical place where someone could\
  \ put it to good use. \n\nMama and Papa and Marina hugged me while I cried, those\
  \ weeks. Living in Spain had been harder than I had expected. The Catalan language,\
  \ the local dialect, was tough to learn. The semi-autonomous region surrounding\
  \ Barcelona had attempted to secede that fall and the city was tense. But still,\
  \ Spain had become my home. Barcelona had caught me with her thousand shades of\
  \ gold in the stucco and roofs and sunlit skyscraper windows. I loved our eclectic\
  \ neighborhood of cranky old Catalan grandmothers and recently arrived Asian immigrants,\
  \ fruterias and noodle shops. This had been our home. This was our home. I wasn\u2019\
  t ready to go. \n\nAt least, now, it was our family \u2013 our new family \u2013\
  \ seeing us off on our journey. Papa had, indeed, packed twelve pieces of luggage,\
  \ two small boys, one Marina, one me, and one Papa into the Opal to head to El Prat,\
  \ the international airport south of town. At the curb, crying, we double-kissed\
  \ goodbye, the Spanish way. \n\nAd\xE9u, la meva nova fam\xEDlia. Ad\xE9u, el cor."
