Text: "As a culinary enthusiast, I had always wanted to expand my skills in a more\
  \ formal setting. I\u2019m not sure what prompted me to start searching the web\
  \ that night, but I can\u2019t be more thankful that I did. What I do know is that\
  \ booking a week long cooking program in the US was outside of my comfort zone,\
  \ let alone a trip to Italy for a culinary holiday. However once I saw the ad on\
  \ Google for Tuscookany in Italy, I knew this experience should be a \u201Cgo big\
  \ or go home\u201D type. Why go to NYC or SF when I could learn authentic Italian\
  \ cooking in a beautiful country I had never experienced. Reading the Tuscookany\
  \ website top to bottom,  I was entranced by the photos and endless five star reviews.\
  \ Of course being the Virgo that I am, I thought it looked amazing but couldn\u2019\
  t quite pull the trigger. That is until two days later when I turned on the t.v.\
  \ and saw scenes from one of my favorite movies \u2013 Under the Tuscan Sun. I 100%\
  \ felt it was a sign that I needed to take this leap. Flash forward to 9 months\
  \ later and I\u2019m stepping off the plane in Florence. Sleep deprived and hazy\
  \ from the overnight flight, I nervously handed over my license to the rental car\
  \ agent and felt my palms sweating. The next hour was going to be one of the most\
  \ daunting of my life\u2014navigate to a villa in the hillside so remote that I\
  \ had to follow a paper map for the last leg of the journey. After struggling to\
  \ figure out the GPS I never had used, but armed with the maps chip that I bought\
  \ off Amazon, I finally figured out how to enter GPS coordinates as opposed to a\
  \ direct address. Whew\u2026first challenge solved. About 10 missed turns and 75\
  \ minutes later, I was approaching the part in the journey where the paper map was\
  \ essential. The paper map had me following landmarks such as \u201Csmall bridge\u201D\
  \ and \u201Cred barn\u201D. Surprisingly no wrong turns, but a very scary and extremely\
  \ steep climb up a winding, gravel drive to reach the villa. I literally thought\
  \ that if I took my foot off the gas for a second that I\u2019d start sliding backwards.\
  \ As I reached the villa, I was tired, sweaty and on edge from the journey, but\
  \ also proud of myself and excited about the week ahead. In the end, it didn\u2019\
  t seem like such a big thing to do on my own, but I soon learned from the other\
  \ female guests that none of them would never dream of driving in an unknown country,\
  \ let alone navigate alone. A major confidence boost, I knew this was something\
  \ that I had made me stronger and was just the start of my solo travel experiences."
