Text: "Last winter I was solo travelling in Romania. As a young woman travelling solo,\
  \ I highly value the chance of reaching out locals, who become precious reference\
  \ points when on the road.\nThanks to Couchsurfing website, in Timi\u0219oara I\
  \ met Adelina, a Romanian student who introduced me to the local nightlife scene,\
  \ and Tudor, an old-date friend of hers living in Ireland and back for a visit.\
  \ We exchanged numbers over a beer and on the following day, when I visited Arad\
  \ I contacted him, to be my local guide. I travelled to the city by mini-bus, my\
  \ best friend in Eastern Europe. Tudor had a world of knowledge on the city\u2019\
  s history and we spent hours chatting. \nTime flew and I missed my bus back to Timi\u0219\
  oara. I could have taken the following one, but the guy was sure: I had to take\
  \ the old-fashioned Romanian train, a real local experience. I followed his advice\
  \ and I embarked in an old crackly train that looked like a movie set. I was thrilled\
  \ by the atmosphere and noises, thinking \u201CIt sounds like it will break\u201D\
  . A couple of minutes later, the train stopped. It was dark outside. The train looked\
  \ empty. After 40 minutes without moving, I started walking through the desert train\
  \ until I found the oddly dressed train controller and asked him what was going\
  \ on. \u201C\u015Eina rupte\u201D, he mumbled in Romanian. He realised I didn\u2019\
  t get it, so he said it slowly, miming \u201C\u015Eiiina rupte\u201D. I still had\
  \ no idea what was going on, but he made me understand it was going to take long.\
  \ All the train doors where open, the few other passengers had gone out on the railways,\
  \ so I did. We were literally in the middle of nowhere, at an intermediary stop.\
  \ All around, nothing but snow and darkness. No lights apart the ones coming from\
  \ the train, a tiny sign saying the name of the village, that didn\u2019t look near\
  \ the station -there was no road. I had no internet connection, I was alone and\
  \ it was getting late. For the first time after years travelling solo, I had no\
  \ idea what to do. There were no other travel alternatives near, I was too far away\
  \ from both main cities to walk or take a taxi and I didn\u2019t have much cash\
  \ on me. Then the enlightening: I called Tudor. Despite he was with his family after\
  \ a long time, he didn\u2019t hesitate, told me not to move, picked his car and\
  \ drove in the snow at night all the way to that village I forgot the name just\
  \ to pick me up. He had only met me the day before. It restored my faith in human\
  \ beings. We are still in touch, and I have that night train ticket framed."
