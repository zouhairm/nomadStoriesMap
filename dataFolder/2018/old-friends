Text: "\u2018It\u2019s you.\u2019\nOne step off the bus and my feet already ache in\
  \ the \u20AC15 sneakers tied around them. The sea is to my right, quiet and steady,\
  \ the rhythm of its small waves meeting the morning\u2019s gentle winds like old\
  \ friends shaking hands. A cluster of seagulls circle the sky, frustrated by the\
  \ lack of food-bearing tourists on the empty beach. I grip my suitcase by its handle,\
  \ meeting the sweaty residue of my previous hold, and glance up at the person talking\
  \ to me. It is an old man leaning against a bicycle: no shoes, little hair, lots\
  \ of freckles. \nI shake my head with a firm \u2018non, merci\u2019 and move past\
  \ him. Living in Paris for the last 6 months has seen me perfect the art of shrugging\
  \ off creeps.\n\u2018No. It\u2019s you.\u2019 \nI falter, my suitcase wheels crunching\
  \ to a halt against the pebbled ground. I look up at the man again and recognise\
  \ now that I know his face- or at least I\u2019ve seen it before. He is no creep,\
  \ no local drunk; just my airbnb host. \n\u2018Oh! Claude!\u2019 I let go of my\
  \ suitcase apologetically, wipe my hand against my jeans and take the old man\u2019\
  s hand. He chuckles and beckons me to follow him, and we start down a cobblestoned\
  \ lane, his bicycle wheels turning slowly in comical contrast to the frantic spins\
  \ of my suitcase's tiny wheels. We arrive at my private lodging and he introduces\
  \ me to his wife, Murielle - a painter and village native, and after a brief apartment\
  \ tour I\u2019m left to explore the stunning region the couple call home: Camaret-Sur-Mer,\
  \ a port commune in north-western France. Casseroles and canvases, fishing lines\
  \ and bare feet. Rolling hills and postcard sunsets, all dancing from Murielle's\
  \ brush whenever she sits down in her studio to paint them.\n\nOn the day of my\
  \ departure, I venture out onto the collection of jetties that form the Port de\
  \ Plaisance, observing the many and different boats dotting the bay. I come to the\
  \ end of the furthest jetty from the shore and stand at its edge. Then I hear a\
  \ shuffle inside the boat on my left and turn as its inhabitant ducks out onto the\
  \ deck.\nIt is Claude, unwinding a rope from its post on the dock, preparing to\
  \ sail off. His surprise makes way for a warm, broad smile, and I return one that\
  \ matches. \u2018It\u2019s you!\u2019\n\nWhen my bus drives away that afternoon,\
  \ I look back at the sea and the air shaking hands once more and already look forward\
  \ to someday returning, extending my own hand; reuniting with old friends."
