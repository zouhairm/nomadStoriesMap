Text: "It was the middle of May when I found myself short on funds in the bustling\
  \ city of Barcelona when out of pure desperation and the threat of bankruptcy, I\
  \ procured a temporary volunteer job on a farm in the Spanish countryside town of\
  \ Flix.  This town was located a couple of hours from Barcelona by train, and after\
  \ an hour waiting by the station eating uncooked pasta from my suitcase, my boss,\
  \ Marco, finally arrived to drive me up to the farm where he introduced me to my\
  \ two work new work colleagues, who were both coincidently also named Marco.  As\
  \ though to reflect how my three weeks there would go, on the first night, the the\
  \ bunk bed I had been provided with collapsed and it took two of the three available\
  \ Marcos to rescue me.  Keeping in form, on the afternoon of the third day, my boss\
  \ called me into the living room and told me that I was fired, which I had at first\
  \ suspected to be due to my name not being Marco, but in fact it was because, I\
  \ \u201Cdidn\u2019t look happy\u201D.  Desperate not to lose my only accomodation\
  \ in Spain, I negotiated to keep working; taking the harder jobs on the farm in\
  \ return.  I was tasked from then on to herd a pack of forty goats for two hours\
  \ a day every day in the blasting sun of the Spanish countryside, the only issue\
  \ I really had with this job is that I dislike goats very much. During the first\
  \ morning of goat herding all of the goats had gathered around me when I leant down\
  \ to feed one of them and for the briefest of moments I thought that goats weren\u2019\
  t so bad after all, until I realised that they had simply mistaken my hair for food\
  \ and were trying to eat it.  Several days went by like this, before the heat of\
  \ summer had started to drive me insane.  I had taken to talking to the goats every\
  \ day when I walked them outside, even going so far as to name some of them and\
  \ one day, in a moment of boredom and privacy from my boss, I discovered that the\
  \ goats really liked a specific opera song I had on my phone, which was \u201CWild\
  \ Swans: Eliza Aria\u201D as performed by The Tasmanian Symphony.  Needless to say\
  \ I enjoyed the experience, but after my comical descent on a collapsible bunk bed,\
  \ the temporary lapse into madness, and hosting repetitive classical music concerts\
  \ for goats, I was not sorry to watch the farm vanish into the hills in the rear\
  \ window of my boss\u2019s car."
