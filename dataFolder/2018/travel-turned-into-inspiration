Text: "There are some experiences in life that unexpectedly seem to have a tremendous\
  \ impact on the person you become, and the career path you decide to take. Since\
  \ my medical school was so close to the USA-Mexico border, the UC Irvine Flying\
  \ Samaritans chapter, was actually a driving chapter. Each month we drove down to\
  \ El Testerazo, Mexico to give medical care and medications to an underserved community.\
  \ I immediately fell in love with the close-knit community in the middle of the\
  \ desert. Every time we arrived, the children of El Testerazo, Mexico would run\
  \ and greet our caravan of cars. They would all laugh at my then broken Spanish,\
  \ but would appreciate my trying.  Even if we couldn\u2019t offer much, they were\
  \ just appreciative that we were there, and that we cared. The experience was challenging\
  \ and rewarding at the same time- to work with limited resources, but to become\
  \ a trusted member of their community was priceless. Each time I went to the \u201C\
  Flying Sams\u201D clinic, I remembered why I went into medicine in the first place.\n\
  \nI truly learned what the heart of medicine was, when I met a tiny patient named\
  \ Normita. The giant smile on her face masked her dire need for medical assistance,\
  \ while the pain and desperation was evident in her mother Norma's face. Normita\
  \ had a heart condition that would cause her to turn blue when she began playing.\
  \ Nothing could be done for her in Mexico.  The \u201CFlying Sams\u201D worked day\
  \ and night to raise money for Normita, and to bring her to Los Angeles to obtain\
  \ a costly life-saving surgery. Against all odds, Normita had the surgery... she\
  \ survived... and she was thriving. When I last saw her. the beaming smile on her\
  \ face made her indistinguishable from any other 2-year-old girl.\n\nAnd then, the\
  \ unthinkable happened. I received a call. It was all a blur. \"Something happened...\
  \ it doesn't look good... she's on a bypass machine.\" No one knew what had happened.\
  \ She was having a routine procedure to remove scar tissue removed from her surgical\
  \ site. And then her heart stopped. This shouldn't have happened. And the thing\
  \ I will never forget, was the look on Norma's face when she ultimately passed away.\
  \ Never have I seen so much pain and anguish as I saw in her face at that moment.\
  \ But in tragedy, there was a glimmering light of hope. This experience paved the\
  \ way for the Flying Sams to save other children's lives through life-saving surgeries.\
  \ It also showed how everyone could come together and embody the humanity of medicine."
