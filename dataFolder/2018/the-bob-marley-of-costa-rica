Text: "The walk to the surf school was twenty minutes along the shore. Waves crashed\
  \ in even spurts, with an occasional surfer bobbing up like a pool toy. A man with\
  \ chocolate terracotta skin and blond dreads waved me over. With his graying roots,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t tell if he was twenty-five or fifty. \u201CHola!\u201D he said\
  \ with a wide smile that transformed half of his face into an evenly spaced crescent.\
  \ \n\nHe introduced himself as Cali, but everyone in Jac\xF3 calls him Bob Marley.\
  \ Cali has lived in Jac\xF3 for 21 years. He\u2019s not Rastafarian, but he has\
  \ lots of Jamaican paraphernalia and loves Reggae music. He doesn\u2019t eat animals\
  \ anymore, because he grew up in Puerto Viejo on a farm and learned to kill animals\
  \ very young. He knew how to use a gun before a surfboard. \n\nHis mother was a\
  \ professional calypso dancer. That\u2019s where his real name comes from. She won\
  \ an award when she was eight months pregnant with Cali. \u201CI knew you would\
  \ pop out of my belly swaying,\u201D she told him.\n\nWe started the lesson on land.\
  \ Cali demonstrated how to lay down on the board: both hands at chest level, then,\
  \ leaning up in a sun salutation, how to slide one foot to the front before assuming\
  \ the iconic surfer pose. He chastised me for moving both feet. \u201CNo, you\u2019\
  re doing it wrong. Your foot stays here. Try it again.\u201D He held my back foot\
  \ down. \u201CAgain,\u201D he commanded. \n\nFrom the shoreline, I didn\u2019t notice\
  \ how strong the riptide was. It was like walking on a treadmill in a sandpit. \u201C\
  This is your wave,\u201D he signaled. I looked behind me at a blue-gray monolith.\
  \ \u201CUp! Up! Up!\u201D I heard him screaming. I leaned up, eyes level with the\
  \ palm trees. I stood for a second and then felt my body hesitate and fall backwards.\
  \ The salt water flooded my nose and mouth, weighing down my body from the inside\
  \ out. \n\n\u201CThe wave always gets smaller,\u201D Cali said. I tried to quit.\
  \ \u201CNot until you stay up.\u201D My leg muscles ached but I kept going. Finally,\
  \ I rode a wave to shore. \u201COne more time and we\u2019ll stop,\u201D he said.\
  \ \n\nOn our way back to the tent another instructor greeted us with two glasses\
  \ of fresh pineapple juice. \u201CYou were thinking too much. That\u2019s why you\
  \ fell,\u201D Cali told me, waving his drink for emphasis. \u201C\u2018Knees bent,\
  \ knees bent,\u2019 you kept saying. You were too tense. You weren\u2019t breathing.\u201D\
  \ He locked his legs and mimicked falling backwards. \u201CYou don\u2019t think\
  \ while you surf. You just do.\u201D \n\nOne Love started playing on the radio.\
  \ With a grin, Cali started swaying."
