Text: "If there was any doubt about my new living situation, the incessant yapping\
  \ as I walked down the hall made it crystal clear. Princess, Miracle, Blackie &\
  \ Ashley (chihuahuas) and Liz (woman) were my new roommates. I had not intended\
  \ to sign myself up to the school of hard knocks, but turns out I was about to learn\
  \ a few lessons from one hell of a teacher and her furry teaching assistants. \n\
  \nMy first lesson was pure survival. I had rocked up to my NYC accommodation in\
  \ pure Brisbane winter gear - that being my cutest fall boots and a nice Autumnal\
  \ jacket. First thing Liz does is announce that all she eats is junk food. Good\
  \ to know. The second thing she does is offer me her Timbalands and a ski jacket\
  \ she hadn\u2019t worn since the 80s. That\u2019s when I knew I was in safe hands.\n\
  \nLesson number two - hustle. Liz was a hustler - she didn\u2019t even have a bedroom,\
  \ she just slept in the living room while she rented out her two bedrooms to make\
  \ some cash. Deadset, she constantly had two craigslist randoms (in today\u2019\
  s case, me) living with her for that pork chop money. She loved pork chops. So if\
  \ you want something? Hustle. There\u2019s always a way. And sometimes not having\
  \ a bedroom is the price you\u2019ve got to pay.\n\nLesson number three- family\
  \ first. Look, living with four chihuahuas was never my plan. But Liz didn\u2019\
  t have parents with her. She didn\u2019t have any siblings. No kids. A friends that\
  \ she considered family, but even then sometimes it took a promise of some cash,\
  \ or use of her good faith for them to come around. So when Princess passed away,\
  \ she put her in cardboard box and got a cab to the best pet crematory in NYC. It\
  \ might\u2019ve cost her most of, but there was nothing she wouldn\u2019t do for\
  \ those damn chihuahuas.\n\nWhen I envisioned living in NYC, I did not envision\
  \ the projects. I did not envision getting called \u2018snowflake\u2019 everytime\
  \ I left my apartment (I took it as a compliment). I definitely did not envision\
  \ four mangy mutts greeting me everytime I came home. But one month turned into\
  \ one year. I got used to the yapping, the pee pad, the dog shit in the kitchen\
  \ Saying goodbye to the remaining chihuahuas was unsurprisingly easy - but saying\
  \ goodbye to Liz was tough. It\u2019s not often you find a Puerto Rican guardian\
  \ angel on Craigslist. But when you do, you gotta make the most of it."
