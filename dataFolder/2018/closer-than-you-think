Text: "A lone elephant sauntered across the runway  as our small plane landed in the\
  \ South African bush.  This was the first of the \u201CBig Five\u201D animals that\
  \ I\u2019d see on Safari \u2013 Lion, Leopard, Cape Buffalo, Elephant, and Rhinoceros\
  \ \u2013 so called because game hunters once considered these to be the most dangerous\
  \ animals to hunt.  I was on a quest with my Nikon camera!\n\nFrom the early morning\
  \ game drives to the afternoon and evening drives, Kruger National Park welcomed\
  \ me to its stark winter beauty, with an expert tracker perched on the hood of the\
  \ jeep ready to jump off at a moment\u2019s notice to study fresh tracks as the\
  \ expert guide navigated the rugged dirt roads in search of the animal kingdom\u2019\
  s panoply.\n\nI knew it would be exhilarating to observe and photograph animals\
  \ but the last thing I expected was to be so very close, sitting in an open jeep,\
  \ sometimes just 20 feet from a hungry pride of lions or driving through a herd\
  \ of Cape buffalo! I held my breath many times - as a leopard stopped right next\
  \ to the jeep to sniff a blanket that one in our group had accidentally dropped\
  \ on the ground.  I was sure he was going to leap into the jeep to find who had\
  \ dropped it as it had her scent!  Or as a large parade of elephants marched across\
  \ the road on the way to bathe in the river as crocodiles basked in the sun.  Or\
  \ as I watched animals hunt and kill their prey while they tried to keep greedy\
  \ and vicious hyenas from stealing their catch.\n\nAll the excitement wasn\u2019\
  t with our group just sitting still \u2013 the guide chased fresh tracks through\
  \ bushes and rough terrain when the tracker sensed he was on to something \u2013\
  \ the elusive cheetahs or male giraffes \u201Cnecking\u201D as they fought for dominance.\
  \  We encountered a rare sighting of hippos on open land \u2013 blocking our road\
  \ back to camp!  All we could do was patiently wait for them to move.  I have never\
  \ experienced anything like this at a city zoo!  \n\nBaboons played on the roof\
  \ of my cottage creating a cacophony in the stillness of the night, reminding me\
  \ that the magic and thrill of Safari would begin again tomorrow, for me and for\
  \ anyone else who would come to experience it.  Safari was an unforgettable experience\
  \ that reshaped how I look at the world.  It taught me the importance of the balance\
  \ of nature and of our fragile ecosystem. The African Bush is an open book that\
  \ generously shared its many chapters with me.  My photographs remind me that Safari\
  \ challenged me to do something unexpected, adventurous, and life changing!"
