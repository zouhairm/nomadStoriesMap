Text: "In last summer I decided to learn more about my region, history, geology, weather\
  \ and costums. I destined myself there to the capital, Belo Horizonte, and surrounding\
  \ area that presided great events in the past, since revolutions to the creations\
  \ of big celebrations.\nI visited the sights, like museum, parks and monuments,\
  \ planning to get more knowledge about the place where I live, in view of the dimension\
  \ of my state, this way the history of the different regions that compose it, do\
  \ not, necessarily, coincide.\nAnd my boyfriend came with me in this adventure and\
  \ Belo Horizonte was my destination. Belo Horizonte was planned to be the Minas\
  \ Gerais\u2019s Capital, maybe because that, is the most organized city which I\
  \ knew in Brazil. \nWe visited Museum different museums. In Arts and Craft museum\
  \ an interactive museum that tell us the history of professional occupations in\
  \ Minas Gerais, highlight the tropeiros (people who sold animals and other products\
  \ through the Brazilian states) and the mining. In Minas Gerais Memorial museum\
  \ I could see exposition about North and Central region, including videos about\
  \ baroque architecture in Ouro Preto. Another thing which impressive me is the fact\
  \ that all the tickets for museums and events in general were free, what facility\
  \ the access to many exposition. Besides that, we visited an UNESCO Heritage, Pampulha\
  \ Architectural Complex. I didn\u2019t expect something big like that.\nwe stayed\
  \ in the house from local of Belo Horizonte and they confirmed the rumours about\
  \ the regional hospitality, always disposals to give us information and meal, which\
  \ is irrefutable, due to the famous traditional food of Minas Gerais.\nBelo Horizonte\
  \ is an amazing place, one unexpected surprise. All people who we talked to were\
  \ gentle and patient, the well-known food was tasted excellent, extremely organize\
  \ and well signposted, almost impossible get lost in this city. The incentive to\
  \ visit places and know more about Minas Gerais culture is unmissable. Definably\
  \ one city that I would like return."
