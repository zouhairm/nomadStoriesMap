Text: "I've come to realize that travelling in India often means learning how to function\
  \ in chaos. Traffic un-patterns, crowd un-control, breathing not-air. Stopping at\
  \ a roadside rest stop along the freeway would be normal, except when your van driver\
  \ suddenly u-turns across oncoming traffic to get to it.  Perhaps this is part of\
  \ an unwritten code to do the exact opposite of order, as the sign just in front\
  \ of that particular rest stop begs \"please go the right way on the freeway\".\
  \  So, when the Indigo flight attendant  calmly proclaims that passengers must remain\
  \ seated until the aircraft comes to a complete stop at the gate, this is a cue\
  \ for everyone to immediately get up and start rummaging in overhead bins and clogging\
  \ the aisle.  When that burlap-covered cargo, 10-fold the size of its carrying vehicle,\
  \ hangs impossibly over the sides of the vehicle, maybe with an extra passenger\
  \ or two perched on top, whether that vehicle is a car, a bicycle, or a human-pulled\
  \ platform, that's normal in India. Or when thick black smoke spews from an exhaust\
  \ pipe at eye level amidst food and high-piled produce stalls somewhat masks all\
  \ senses that might be involved in anything to do with breathing, smelling, eating\
  \ or seeing, it's to be expected. \n\nThe food, aahh, that's where, when the smoke\
  \ clears, when you arrive alive at the rest stop restaurant, or the impossibly tiny\
  \ sweet shop, India smacks you with some of the most delicious food on the planet.\
  \ A simple terra cotta container of yogurt, taken from the mini fridge under the\
  \ bare incandescant bulb, reveals a smooth, rich, most unexpectedly flavourful,\
  \ un-yogurty yogurt. A meal of rice, really, really fragrant rice, freshly-produced\
  \ on the villagers' land, by their own hands harvested, chaff removed, steamed and\
  \ served in an unassuming pile, on a plate (beside banana-flower curry, seasoned\
  \ with home-grown turmeric), and green coconut water to drink, (the top hacked off\
  \ by machete in front of your eyes, just then) really cannot even be imagined in\
  \ advance.  \n\nWhat one cannot possibly predict is how the experiences of India,\
  \ will return over a lifetime: exotic smells, colours, tastes and sights; emotions\
  \ of wonder and fascination mixed with memories of stomach knots and confusion.\
  \ I highly recommend it!"
