Text: "The last thing I expected when I arrived in the sunny beach city of Cartagena\
  \ Colombia was to be leaving it the very next day, to instead embark on a multi-day,\
  \ gruelling trek through the Colombian jungle; in the rain. \n\nCartagena is one\
  \ of those cities that wraps you up in it the moment you arrive. Pounding latin\
  \ beats ring out of the windows of second-floor, canary-yellow apartments, while\
  \ beneath them men huddle around storefront TV\u2019s watching the latest soccer\
  \ game. Carts full of brightly coloured fruit are on every street corner, and you\
  \ can buy the juiciest pineapple you\u2019ve ever tasted for a dollar. Then there\
  \ are the mojitos. Never do the cocktails taste so fresh as when the lime comes\
  \ from just kilometres away, and the rum is a country speciality. \n\nWhich brings\
  \ me back to my story.\nThere I was, sipping seaside mojitos with two new-found\
  \ friends, as the sun slowly sank into the ocean. I\u2019d met Leah and Josh in\
  \ the lobby of my guest house just minutes after I\u2019d arrived. Leah is a law\
  \ clerk from Switzerland.  Josh is a soon-to-be-doctor from Denver. Colombia is\
  \ his last hurrah before starting a grinding residency in Detroit. \n\u201CI\u2019\
  m going to \u2018La Ciudad Perdita\u2019,\u201D announced Leah as we downed our\
  \ third round of mojitos. \u201CWhat\u2019s that?,\u201D I asked as slurped the\
  \ end of my drink, sucking the last drops of rum from the melted ice-water in my\
  \ glass.\n\u201CIt\u2019s an ancient city,\u201D she replied. \u201CHidden in the\
  \ Colombian jungle. It takes four days to hike there.\u201D\n\u201CPardon?\u201D\
  , I asked incredulously.  \nShe laughed. \u201CIt\u2019s like the Machu Picchu of\
  \ Colombia, except fewer people know about it.\u201D\nLeah is one of those people\
  \ who I can already tell is smart as a whip and thrives on adventure. Long brown\
  \ hair, big brown eyes, and a body that looks like it belongs on a beach.   \nShe\
  \ quickly pulled up a photo on her phone. My mouth fell open.  \nJosh whistled.\
  \ \u201CDamn.\u201D\nThe picture was a single snap of thousands of stones, meticulously\
  \ stockpiled over and over to create dozens of moss-covered ruins. The abandoned\
  \ buildings were all shapes and sizes, connected together by staircases, and all\
  \ of it was surrounded by towering mountains, covered in lush jungle. \nI was hooked.\
  \ So, evidently, was Josh. A wide smile had stretched across his tan face, and his\
  \ brown eyes glinted. \u201CWhen do you leave?\u201D he asked.   \u201CTomorrow,\u201D\
  \ Leah grinned looking at both of us. \u201CWanna come?\u201D"
