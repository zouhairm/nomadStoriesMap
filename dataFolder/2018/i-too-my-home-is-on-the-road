Text: "\u2018I too, my home is on the road.\u2019\nThese words that were now repetitive\
  \ on my mind were a line from a poem I had written for my late friend\u2019s mother.\
  \ Shootings and robberies have become a norm in the townships, Philippi East to\
  \ be specific. But when \u2018home\u2019 is depressing, where does one come to?\
  \  \nI still couldn\u2019t believe that my aunt thought I had travelled 488.2 km\
  \ from home; Knysna just to lie about being a student. I try not to laugh, only\
  \ \u2018mad\u2019 people laugh alone in these streets.  \nThe rule is to keep your\
  \ head up and tuck your phone in your bra. The cheaper the phone, the more at risk\
  \ you are; thugs are on a mission too. It\u2019s either you walk back to sadness\
  \ or lean on danger. \nThe smell of grilled tripe and chicken sets a different mood\
  \ from that of the Cape Town CBD; the company garden is where I relax and converse\
  \ with street artists after a long lecture. I enjoy watching diverse people from\
  \ different parts of the world touring the mother city or smile at lovebirds kissing\
  \ like they\u2019ll never see each other again. I feel safer around white people\
  \ because where they are, security is tight. I lose myself into laughter thinking\
  \ about the beggar who insulted me for \u2018not having a heart\u2019 i.e. R2, 00.\
  \ It is funny how they act like they have rights to beg and be given.\n\u201CNtombazana,\
  \ ufun\u2019ukufa?\u201D I get distracted by the hooting sound of amaphela (directly\
  \ translated to \u2018cockroaches\u2019) which are the local mini taxis transporting\
  \ people around the townships.  How can he ask such a question?  No I do not want\
  \ to die. I do not bother explaining to the driver that I\u2019m actually in need\
  \ of a shelter. This man would not help; everyone is here to hustle. \nI do not\
  \ fully understand many Xhosa people who emigrate from their proper homes in the\
  \ Eastern Cape to be squashed in these shacks. I spent my whole December in rural\
  \ areas, admiring every second of it; the eloquence in mother tongue, the special\
  \ treatment you get if you are from the \u2018city\u2019 and of cause the smell\
  \ of the soil. I do not recognise my people anymore; I do not even think of Ubuntu,\
  \ which has become a polish for politicians\u2019 speeches.\nAs I approach the train\
  \ station jumping water buckets trying not to disturb the car wash that was now\
  \ occupying the whole pavement, my eyes got caught by the man hammering a shack\
  \ right in the middle of the road. He explained to me that he sells shacks for a\
  \ living; we later spent time in his home where he used to stay with his only 6year\
  \ old daughter before I walked into their lives."
