Text: "We arrived! Last day in Busan before going back.\nThe tensions between US and\
  \ Korea are high and soon I return to more homely problems.\n\nA day ahead and so\
  \ far nothing to do. I take a look at the map in the guesthouse. City, museums,\
  \ university, beaches- I have seen it all except Oryukdo Skywalk. Right by it a\
  \ lovely walk by the coast.\nI ask the owner if I have enough time to get back,\
  \ she replies enthusiastically: \u2019Yes, very pretty!\u2019 So I hang my bag over\
  \ my shoulder and look at myself- plastic, sparkly heels, a mini skirt.\n \n\u2018\
  Can I go dressed like that?\u2019\nShe, still enthusiastic.\n\u2019Yes, very pretty\
  \ too!\u2019\u2019\n\nSo I push back my doubts. A bus ride later I arrive to first\
  \ admire the Walk. A glass balcony hangs 35m over turbulent sea overlooking a horizon\
  \ of blue water. The islands sit strongly against the tide. This ever changing view\
  \ hypnotizes for hours but I continue, engraving the images in my mind.\n\nFirst\
  \ half an hour, one big hill and a bit of a scare but I shove it into my back pocket.\
  \ As I keep going the walk grows more difficult and quickly turns into a hike. \u2019\
  All's well\u2019, I tell myself. But as everyone passes in hiking gear I deeply\
  \ question my sanity and curse trusting the lady. It was too late to quit though.\
  \ Plus I knew if I turned back I'd regret it. The feeling of adventure stuck with\
  \ me. This time I promise myself to listen.\n\nAs I pause I get surrounded by 80\
  \ year old hikers with pace similar to mine. We end up walking together, as one\
  \ of the elders flags me with a thumbs up. I thumb-up him back.\n\n\u2019American?\u2019\
  \nI laugh. All Koreans think if you\u2019re white you're from US.\n\u2019Polandu-ru'\n\
  I attempt at some Korean I learned the past 3 weeks. He claps his hands together.\n\
  \u2019Poland! Football!\u2019\nHe kicks his imaginary ball and stares down at my\
  \ shoes, one eyebrow questioning, shaking a finger in disapproval. I shake my arms\
  \ in return. And we continue, in agreement signed by our mutual silence, to share\
  \ this journey together.\n\nIt was meant to be. With them all signs in Korean, warning\
  \ about building sites and polluted water, weren't blissfully ignored. Otherwise\
  \ I would've drank my way into food poisoning or walked off the edge of the cliff.\
  \ But we continued until the finish line. Our form of communication? Few global\
  \ gestures and mutual appreciation of beauty around us. Nothing else. \n\nAs we\
  \ reach the end, I pull out a postcard and write a short message. \n\n\n\u2018Hope\
  \ you find someone to translate it\u2019. \n\n\nThey bow in thank yous and continue\
  \ the route opposite to mine."
