Text: "A terrific day discovering the Peace Park yesterday so headed to the 2 main\
  \ museums in Hiroshima Park today. \n\nAnyway the first museum which is definitely\
  \ up there as not just an educational institution, but incredibly tasteful and moving,\
  \ is the Hiroshima National Peace Memorial Hall for the Atomic Bomb Victims. It\
  \ starts at ground level with a sculpture of a clock frozen at 8.15am and then you\
  \ step down to enter into the truly magnificent Hall of Remembrance. It\u2019s a\
  \ circular shape depicting a photograph of the bombed Hiroshima only it\u2019s built\
  \ from 140,000 tiles representing the number killed initially. It is a work of art\
  \ beyond words.\n\nIn the centre of the room is a small clock water feature frozen\
  \ at 8.15am. I was overwhelmed by the beauty quite frankly and stood next to the\
  \ water feature, closed my eyes and sort of prayed. Given I\u2019m atheist, it was\
  \ all I could do to pay some form of respect. It was definitely sincere that\u2019\
  s the main thing I guess.\n\nAfter the Hall, you could watch a video, read some\
  \ reflections from those who wrote diaries at the time, or go into an extensive\
  \ library and watch video interviews with survivors who were interviewed in 2005\
  \ at the 60th anniversary. For many of these victims, this was the first time they\
  \ spoken of the horrors so it was extremely traumatic for them and emotional to\
  \ watch. Generations since the bombing are still struggling emotionally and the\
  \ effects of radiation are still lingering. All in all a very moving and educational\
  \ experience.\n\nFrom there it was over to the large Hiroshima Peace Memorial Museum.\
  \ It\u2019s a very grim building, similar to an East German Stasi Headquarters in\
  \ the 70s but so it should be. What\u2019s not grim is the attitude of the Japanese\
  \ who continue to smile and attend to your every wish. One thing we\u2019ve noticed\
  \ in Japan is that \u201Cseniors\u201D are everywhere and working! The average lifespan\
  \ of a Japanese man is 74 and woman is 89! Lots of single working grannies out there!\
  \  \n\nAfter a few big hours of gazing in horror and bewilderment of man\u2019s\
  \ inalienable capacity to destroy each other, we thought we\u2019d hike a few km\
  \ to the other side of the city and the Contemporary Art Museum where we spent a\
  \ couple of hours gazing and reflecting on a city that outside forces did their\
  \ best to annihilate but didn't comprehend just how resilient the locals were. Hiroshima\
  \ has a dark history but it's beautiful, kind nature over-compensates whatever the\
  \ past has dealt them. An absolute must see when visiting Japan."
