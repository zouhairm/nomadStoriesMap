Text: "In rural South West Bangladesh, there is a very quiet village called Umajuri.\
  \ In the spring of 2012, the \u2018festival of colours,\u2019 better known here\
  \ as Rangwali Holi, was upon this marginalised Hindi community. This was where I\
  \ made a local connection.\n\nI had been volunteering there for almost 2 months\
  \ and had noticed a few interesting things. First, when a pet tortoise is flaunted\
  \ to you upon arrival, and if 2 weeks later he\u2019s nowhere to be seen, it\u2019\
  s better to not ask too many questions around the dinner table. Next, not many,\
  \ if any, white blokes over 6\u20195\u2019\u2019 stroll through Umajuri, so the\
  \ spectacle really is worth leaving your house to have a good look at. Finally,\
  \ as a result of my white British ethnicity, I was involuntarily placed in a position\
  \ of prowess within the community. Families would usher me into their homes to feed\
  \ me beyond their own means, schoolchildren would run down the street to claim a\
  \ handshake from me, and my host family were the envy of the entire street, since\
  \ they housed the precious \u2018Bideshi\u2019 \u2013 a local word for foreigner.\n\
  \nIn the run up to the festival, I increasingly began noticing discrimination towards\
  \ those of a lower \u2018caste.\u2019 This was after all a Hindu community, and\
  \ the simple way of life here only exaggerated the level of social exclusion. At\
  \ a closer glance, I also saw a stark division between sexes, arising from a blend\
  \ of misogyny, trepidation, and \u2013 even between elders \u2013 immaturity. The\
  \ elderly gentleman, quite set in their ways, reminded me of the old boys you still\
  \ find in rural Lancashire today, detesting and adoring their wives in equal measure.\n\
  \nI had enjoyed my own elevated social status until witnessing this social stratification,\
  \ so I was looking forward to the distraction of the festival. I still had no idea\
  \ what I was about to experience.\n\nFrom dawn till dusk, the air was full of colour,\
  \ laughter and music. Food lay on every street corner, energy surged through every\
  \ crowd flocking the streets and smiles were omnipresent. I even noticed young girls\
  \ and boys interact in a way I had never seen there, nor would see again while I\
  \ remained. There was no maliciousness or mischievousness in their interactions;\
  \ just kids acting as kids should, irrespective of caste or gender.\n\nLater I would\
  \ reflect how the festival, which represents the thwarting of a Hindu demon king,\
  \ thwarted the social boundaries riddling this community. It was as of this point\
  \ that Umajuri touched me, and so it was that I made a local connection."
