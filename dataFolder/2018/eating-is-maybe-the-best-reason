Text: "There are reasons and reasons to make us travel: meeting new places and cultures,\
  \ shopping, eating, visiting family members and friends etc. Since my whole family\
  \ and friends live in the same city as mine, I have never seen another reason to\
  \ travel except visiting new places and to learn more about the local culture. \n\
  At some point of my life, I started to be interested by gastronomy, because one\
  \ day I realized in my family and at my house food is a union symbol. It's having\
  \ what to talk about even with whom you thought you didn\u2019t have affinity. It\u2019\
  s going to the City Market to buy products and end up having a conversation with\
  \ seller. It\u2019s sharing a small kitchen with your family members, everyone laughing\
  \ together. Eating is a pleasure, and to share this moment with whom we love is\
  \ priceless.  \nOne day I invited my brother to travel with me to S\xE3o Paulo.\
  \ And S\xE3o Paulo is for Brazil what New York for the USA: it's megalopolis, rushing;\
  \ people of all races and genders. It's Brazilians, Asians, North and South Americans\
  \ and Europeans. \u201CS\xE3o Paulo is life\u201D. \nI had been in S\xE3o Paulo\
  \ before that time, one day to visit a friend and another time to watch her graduation\
  \ ceremony. But at that time eating was our main reason to travel!\nFor the first\
  \ time in my life, I was traveling to spend the money I had saved on food. The sensation\
  \ was awesome! After all, with a reason like that one the chances for us to have\
  \ a bad trip were of almost 0%. \nMy brother and I were ready to go, with an open\
  \ chest. We left our city with a small list of restaurants to visit, though we also\
  \ had left some empty spaces for the new places we might discover there. \nFortunately,\
  \ I have 2 friends who live there and they indicated amazing places. We visited\
  \ from an Indian restaurant to a traditional Portuguese confectionery. We ate pizzas,\
  \ burgers, cafes, Arabic food, at the City Market and even in a Chinese neighborhood.\
  \ I remember to be so into the experience, always up to try new things.\nOne week\
  \ was the time we had to do everything we wanted to. I left S\xE3o Paulo asking\
  \ myself when it'd be the next opportunity to make a gastronomy traveling experience.\n\
  On the plane back home, I thought about what Heraclitus one day said \u201Cno man\
  \ ever steps in the same river twice\u201D. Borrowing his idea, after this trip\
  \ I\u2019d say it doesn\u2019t matter how many times we visit a country\u2215city,\
  \ if we have different reasons it won\u2019t ever be the same. It\u2019ll always\
  \ have something new for us to learn, to feel... or to eat."
