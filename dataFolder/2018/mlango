Text: "MLANGO\nIt all began last Friday when a guy we met on tinder asked if we could\
  \ meet and talk, well I thought it was just grabbing coffee at java or some fries\
  \ at the KFC but apparently he was up for something else. So he asks \u201Cdo you\
  \ want to go to oasis, kolol, or mlango?\u201D after a handshake and some awkwardness\
  \ that preceded that, so I think oasis is a resort, I have been to kolol before\
  \ but I wouldn\u2019t mind going again, well on the other side mlango seem fun and\
  \ I haven\u2019t been there before \u201Cmlango\u201D is a Swahili word for door,\
  \ so I was curious as to why a place is called door,  but I wasn\u2019t decided\
  \ on seeing my confusion he takes my hand and literally drags me to the bus stage.\
  \  So we take PSV to a place call mlango and after alighting we make a 7km walk\
  \ deeper, the sun on our case, nevertheless I love the walk it keeps me healthy.\n\
  Mlango is actually a cool place looks like those places I used to see in the telly,\
  \ with rafts, canoes, canopy walk and a place to relax and have ice scream he had\
  \ actually carried my own black forest and l wonder how he figured this was my favourite\
  \ but again he probably had been stalking me for a while and a soda, the waterfall,\
  \ variety of bird species the cliffs bridges made my day. The throbbing sound of\
  \ water as they race towards the cliff melted my heart, the beautiful diamond stones\
  \ along the edges of the river kept us busy for the most part of the day, we collected\
  \ them cleaned them, and  it looked like those precious gems at the gallery art.\n\
  The whole week I had been so demotivated, I couldn\u2019t get one thing right, I\
  \ was very angry at my current situation: no job, no shillings, I was already beginning\
  \ to feel like a burden to my family, but this trip down here was just what I needed,\
  \ the connection to nature, being able to just breath OMG! I had actually forgotten\
  \ how to breath, listen to the sound of birds and the water calmed me, it made me\
  \ appreciate life. Talking to Obadiah, laughing and playing with water, walking\
  \ down the bridge taking lots and lots of pic, I can\u2019t believe I was actually\
  \ laughing and being so relaxed, I just need to sit and watch things play out.\n\
  The day was great, left having being satisfied and with new positive energy, I learnt\
  \ a lot\nIncluding the fact that mlango is a gate to another county just like how\
  \ we have border ports in countries."
