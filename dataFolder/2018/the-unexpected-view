Text: "We are trudging up hill and I\u2019m carefully listening to my Mom\u2019s breathing\
  \ to see if she is struggling in any way as we move step by step and I listen to\
  \ my own ragged breath. I wish I was in better shape, I\u2019m thinking so I wouldn\u2019\
  t feel my lungs burning or the sweat starting to pull into my shirt.  My Mom walks\
  \ ahead of me with her head down too. We are on the entry path to Manchu Picchu\
  \ on a mother/daughter trip we had been planning for over a year.\n\nShe came to\
  \ me last year. \u201CI have an important question to ask you, and I want you to\
  \ think about it and get back to me\u201D she says to me in a serious tone. \u201C\
  Would you like to go to Manchu Picchu with me? Your father has no interest and I\
  \ have always wanted to go and I think for my 60th birthday it would be a great\
  \ thing to do.\u201D I agree immediately.\n\nAll through the spring I got the puzzled\
  \ (sometimes concerned) looks from friends and then the question, \u201Cwith your\
  \ mom?\u201D\nI nod and say \u201Cyes, I\u2019m sure it will be fine\u201D.\n\n\
  To be honest, I didn\u2019t know what to expect. I had my concerns. I had travelled\
  \ quite a bit but my Mom was more of a luxury traveller. We weren\u2019t going luxury\
  \ to Peru.  he was relatively fit but, we would be in the upper elevations of the\
  \ Andes and altitude sickness didn\u2019t seem to discriminate. I hoped we bonded\
  \ and didn\u2019t drive each other crazy. I didn\u2019t ask my Mom why she wanted\
  \ to go to Peru it seemed self-explanatory.\nNow though, here we were \u2013 slowly\
  \ making our way to the top. As we approached the ledge, I look out - amazed at\
  \ the sight. I do what most people of my generation do \u2013 I pull out my iPhone.\
  \  I look for my Mom wanting to get a picture with her and I hesitate. She is not\
  \ rummaging around for her camera.\n\nHer face is beaming. She looks over at me.\n\
  \n\u201CI remember when they uncovered it\u201D she says in a low voice. \u201C\
  I had to come.\u201D\n\nI see something I never expected \u2013 a little girl, sitting\
  \ on her bedroom floor, paging through a worn National Geographic, dreaming of big\
  \ things in faraway places. I am proud. I think of my Mom with her very working\
  \ class (and often challenging) upbringing - did she think she would ever make it\
  \ here? I am chiding myself for not seeing her dreams until the last moment. I pull\
  \ her over and I snap a selfie. She is still beaming. It\u2019s a smile I\u2019\
  ve never seen before or since. I\u2019m no longer thinking of the sweat on my back.\
  \ She earned her moment. I\u2019m no longer looking at the view. I got to be there\
  \ for her by heading into the unknown \u2026 with my Mom."
