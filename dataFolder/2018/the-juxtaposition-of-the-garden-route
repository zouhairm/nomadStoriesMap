Text: "I lowered my head and stretched my neck, to get a glimpse of it through the\
  \ car windshield; trying to take in the full magnitude of the flowing, droopy, chandelier-esq\
  \ wall.\n\nMy dad saw my reaction and began telling me a story. He said that Thabo\
  \ Mbeki\u2019s motorcade was driving this way and when the President saw it (exactly\
  \ what I was seeing) he insisted that his convoy of cars stop.\n\nHe got out and\
  \ stared up at the mountain peak, which overflowed with greenery, saggy and droopy,\
  \ like lanterns or bobbing heads. He held up the traffic and probably had his security\
  \ detail on edge with this unplanned stop in the middle of nowhere. The President\
  \ apparently said that that was one of the most beautiful exhibitions of nature\
  \ he had ever seen.\n\nMuch like him, the drive alone had me oohing and aahing.\
  \ On the one side, was the vast open ocean, reaching into foreverness; on the other\
  \ side were lakes, interesting houses and interesting fauna and flora occupying\
  \ all available space.\n\nWhen we rounded that particular corner and the road dipped\
  \ into what looked to be a valley, \nI understood why it was called the Garden Route.\
  \ There was a huge mountain of vegetation on the right-hand side and the Kaaimans\
  \ River on the left.\n\nI saw the greenest green I\u2019ve ever seen, though it\
  \ was short-lived as we approached the site of last years monstrous Knysna fire.\
  \ The charcoaled remains of the sweeping forests stretched for kilometres - much\
  \ further than I could ever have imagined and further than the media could have\
  \ described.\n\nI noticed the ground was looking green, but the bare trunks and\
  \ branches could not deceive us. As we neared the town, I began seeing homes that\
  \ were scorched. Nearly 6 months later, this visual reminder still stood.\n\nThe\
  \ town was busy, everyone was out and seemed to be in holiday mode, and I don\u2019\
  t know why I expected something different. We decided to explore the Waterfront\
  \ market and everyone there also seemed upbeat and welcoming. There was an array\
  \ of shops, all fairly priced (I was expecting marked up tourist prices).\n\nA shopkeeper\
  \ at one store started chatting to me, asking where I was from. The journalist in\
  \ me jumped at this opportunity to speak to a local about the fire, but I quickly\
  \ backed out and went on exploring.\n\nI can\u2019t begin to understand the collective\
  \ trauma the residents must be feeling. Seeing the remains on the drive into the\
  \ town, left me feeling down. I didn\u2019t have the courage to disrupt the energy\
  \ that a South African December brings."
