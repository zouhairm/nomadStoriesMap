Text: "Chefchaouen, with colorful potted plants mounted up the sides of its iconic\
  \ blue houses, seems frozen in time compared to the bustling city of Birmingham\
  \ where I grew up. Morocco is a predominantly Muslim country, which was a new experience\
  \ for me. Fortunately, my program leaders connected me with a wise local elder who\
  \ showed me around the city and taught me the norms. We hiked through the market\
  \ squares, where I interacted with street vendors through Spanish, neither of our\
  \ first languages. As we walked up the steep rocky streets, I asked him how locals\
  \ viewed tourists coming into their country, to which he gave such a genuine answer.\
  \ He told me the people of Morocco were enthralled that outsiders were so interested\
  \ in their culture that they would travel across the world just to experience it.\
  \ He said they were excited not only to share their own lifestyles, but also to\
  \ learn about the traveler\u2019s culture as well in mutual exchange. At the top\
  \ of a mountain looking across the clusters of buildings and herds of goats ambling\
  \ through the streets, we discussed our universal connection as human beings, and\
  \ above that, our connection in love. This is something that, at the time, gave\
  \ me a euphoric appreciation for exactly where I was in space and time, and still\
  \ inspires me today."
