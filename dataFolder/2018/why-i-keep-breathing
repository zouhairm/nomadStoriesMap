Text: "For making a local connection to my home I\u2019ve traveled since I\u2019m\
  \ able to do it. After studying and gaining work experience for 10 years I decided\
  \ to travel the world for a while. The last thing I expected was that I won\u2019\
  t miss my bed. I also had to leave my boyfriend alone during my traveling. I didn\u2019\
  t miss anything or anybody because I knew that they are all around anyhow. My bed\
  \ was where I dreamed. My 1st stop was Brisbane. I visited one of my best friends.\
  \ We had a perfect time together. She showed me her new home. Very soon I met 3\
  \ new friends with whom I made a road trip for weeks all the way to Sydney. After\
  \ some days I continued camping with my travel mate all over to Melbourne. Melbourne\
  \ very much reminded me to my home so I spontaneously decided to go back to my best\
  \ friend. It again didn\u2019t take much time until I met a cute couple with whom\
  \ I traveled all the way to Cairns. I\u2019ll never forget my time in Australia,\
  \ neither Bali where I volunteered teaching kids. Or Vietnam where neither Christmas\
  \ nor our New Year\u2019s is celebrated. After months of traveling I finally almost\
  \ spent my all money and headed to my last stop, South Africa. I landed nowhere\
  \ else than in Cape Town and totally fell in love immediately. I lived there for\
  \ over 9 weeks. Living in the suburb Observatory, doing yoga, making friends, hiking\
  \ the table mountain and the lions head on Fridays, visiting wine tastings with\
  \ breathtaking fields, petting cheetahs and crying during a drive through diverse\
  \ national parks \u2013 elephants so close that you could hear them breathing. Driving\
  \ all over to Port Elizabeth for volunteering teaching kids again which was one\
  \ of the best experiences in my entire life. Eating the most delicious food since\
  \ leaving Mamas kitchen. A 10k walk for fighting cancer, an internship as a graphic\
  \ designer and of course the locals and their families. When I close my eyes I wake\
  \ up get ready for yoga and already have plans for the rest of the day. The ocean,\
  \ cold as ice and the love people have given me, warm as the sunshine. Time had\
  \ flown fast and I soon knew that my family and friends were waiting for me at home.\
  \ And apart from that I didn\u2019t have any money anymore for resting. Going back\
  \ home and knowing that I can\u2019t travel for a long term in the near future was\
  \ a decision that pushed me to the edge. One year later and I still want to go far\
  \ away so badly that I dream of being away almost every night. But lucky me \u2013\
  \ my home is everywhere. And I\u2019m so grateful for it. *"
