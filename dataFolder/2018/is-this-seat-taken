Text: "He must have been in his sixties and had naturally tanned skin, the kind of\
  \ tanned skin you only see in people from this land. He looked at me with the kindest\
  \ eyes I\u2019ve ever seen, smiled and asked if he could sit next to me. \nWe spoke\
  \ for a while and the more we spoke the more I became aware that I only had an hour\
  \ and a half on the bus with him and the more I considered changing my entire journey\
  \ so I could stay and listen to him for a little while longer.\n\nHe spoke about\
  \ his previous job as a teacher and how he now works with young offenders and helps\
  \ them reintegrate into society. How he guides them through their ancestors\u2019\
  \ values and beliefs and reminds them of where they came from and what they might\
  \ have forgotten about who they are.\n\nHe asked if he could tell me more about\
  \ it. \u201CYes, please do.\u201D \u2013 I replied.\nSo we sat there for what felt\
  \ like the shortest coach journey I\u2019ve ever taken in this gorgeous country\
  \ and he told me about his culture, about his family, about what he believed in\
  \ and was passing on to other people. \n\nHe told me about how much it means to\
  \ him to be able to help others whilst keeping his culture alive. How he\u2019s\
  \ ensuring that a very important part of him and his ancestors is being passed on\
  \ from one generation to the next and how crucial that is in a constantly developing\
  \ world.\n\n\u201CI take them to the Wharenui, you see\u201D. \nThe Wharenui is\
  \ incredibly meaningful to his people. It\u2019s not a religious place but it symbolises\
  \ an ancestor of a specific tribe. You can look and see the different body parts\
  \ of the ancestor represented in it. It is considered a place of unity and peace.\n\
  \nHe smiled a lot and he was very patient. He replied to all my questions with the\
  \ soft voice of someone who\u2019s been doing this all his life. He thanked me for\
  \ listening and for learning. \n\u201CIt\u2019s a pity you\u2019re in The Land of\
  \ the Long White Cloud for a short stay. I am confident you would be a top student.\u201D\
  \n\nI\u2019ll never forget the first words he said to me:\n- \u201CKia Ora!\u201D\
  \ he said. \u201CIs this seat taken?\u201D\n\nI thanked him for sharing so much\
  \ about him and about what it means to be Maori. \nHe told me he believed he was\
  \ destined to sit next to me and it was important that he shared everything he did.\
  \ He explained that sometimes we send a silent message to others and when it happens,\
  \ we become a part of the other person\u2019s journey.\n\nAs I got ready to get\
  \ off the bus, I asked:\n- What is your name?\n- Michael. - He said\n- What is your\
  \ real name?\n- Meke Keepa"
