Text: "Vasco likes the past. I imagine that the language he speaks would be understandable\
  \ to Fernando Pessoa. When he calls you without a courtesy of the third form voc\xEA\
  , you should know that it means a lot. Windows of his shop are wide, good to see\
  \ details. On the other side of the street there is a lane, where young lovers think\
  \ that they can hide from Vasco\u2019s sight. On the left there is a bar where Jos\xE9\
  \ drinks Sagres beer and watches TV. Life in Alfama, the district of Lisbon where\
  \ Vasco spent his whole life, was always slow. \n\nBut times are changing. Recently\
  \ clocks can be determined by dates of closing. Lusitano club, fifteen minutes walking\
  \ from Vasco\u2019s shop after 111 years had to close the doors. Members of the\
  \ association left a letter where they pointed that Alfama doesn\u2019t smell like\
  \ fado how it was in the era of Amalia Rodrigues. Lusitano made a space for luxury\
  \ apartments. \n\nVasco works in his shoe shop for 67 years. He is a historian without\
  \ diploma, who needed to leave school to work when he was 10. As a little boy he\
  \ was sometimes waking up and going to sleep feeling a drilling lack in his stomach\
  \ after not having dinner. But could you imagine anything better than playing with\
  \ kids next to Pantheon during the summer days? Vasco collects photos and newspaper\
  \ clippings about old springs of Alfama, Moorish past, end of the colonial times.\
  \ As a treasure he keeps a photo of Pantheon being built. Vasco \u2013 it\u2019\
  s a name of an explorer and a careful observer. \n\nIt was one of those hot summer\
  \ days when you feel chilly trickles of sweat running down under your knees. Passing\
  \ the doors of Vasco\u2019s shop felt like stepping into the promise land of cold.\
  \ I dreamt about uncovered shoes. When I\u2019ve found them, Vasco told me to put\
  \ my foot on the wooden stool. The intimacy of clasping sandals was a starting point\
  \ of the story about the past. \u2013 When I was a child I was using this stool\
  \ to play \u2013 he said.\n\nVasco is a one of those life teachers who are going\
  \ to leave the city taking a piece of its soul. That kind of people don\u2019t turn\
  \ into monuments. Tourists are not going to see holes in the perfection of the streets\
  \ of Alfama. They won\u2019t feel the misery that sometimes still makes fado singers\
  \ feel saudade for real. The new fado is a sound of closing doors, a shuffle of\
  \  tourist\u2019s legs walking down from ferries, quiet chats of those who stayed\
  \ in Alfama. It\u2019s a sound of a distance between walkers and locals, melody\
  \ of solitude of the city on the edge of the worlds."
