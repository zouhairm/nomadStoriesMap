Text: "Travel to me has always been a way to meet new people and cultures. One such\
  \ trip was to Himachal Pradesh, the northern part of India. We were camping at the\
  \ Chandrataal lake campsite at Lahual-spiti. It was the cold winter evening and\
  \ me with our group of four friends decided to go for a stroll in the woods. From\
  \ a distance we could see smoke rising in the wood and I felt the curiosity to go\
  \ and see what dwelled in middle of these woods. As we walked towards the rising\
  \ smoke we saw a small Hut. My heart started racing as we got closer to the Hut,\
  \ for we didn't know what waited for us inside or around the Hut.  The day started\
  \ losing it's light and we were approaching the dark of the night. It's our torches\
  \ on we got further close to the Hut and we heard the dogs bark. Immediatly we stopped\
  \ around 50 metres away from the Hut. \n   I decided to call out for someone to\
  \ see if there was anyone inside the house. Still unsure of what might come out\
  \ of the Hut. Two minutes later an old man came out of the Hut and he asked where\
  \ we came from. Tired of walking till the Hut I asked the old man to make some hot\
  \ tea which will keep us warm in the cold night. The old man invited us inside the\
  \ Hut. There was little bonfire inside where we sat to warm ourselves. The tea I\
  \ asked was accompanied by smile and that got us not just tea but a paratha (Indian\
  \ bread) too,  which the old man had freshly cooked. That day I got my travel mantra\
  \ \"Ask for anything with a smile on the face and you shall surely get it\". We\
  \ spent around two hours in the Hut we were unsure of going to. And the old man\
  \ accompanied us back to the campsite to ensure that we reached back safe."
