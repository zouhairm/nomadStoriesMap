Text: "\u201CA voi che entrate, quando si gioca, si gioca! Quando si studia, si studia!\u201D\
  \nTo you who enter, when you play, you play! When you study, you study!\n\nThese\
  \ words, attached to an eye and face, are painted on a metal door in a closed down\
  \ factory about 20 minutes east of the centre of Rome. This door leads to a room\
  \ that resembles what one could imagine the inside of a child\u2019s mind to look\
  \ like. Blues, oranges, pinks and purples flow and cover concrete walls with large,\
  \ realistic paintings of young children. The afternoon light gently shines through\
  \ the loft-like windows and illuminates the spacious room. Every wall is painted\
  \ with colourful art, flowing into one another effortlessly and hiding the cold\
  \ cement behind it. \nMy art class shuffles in, our eyes light up, our smiles brighten,\
  \ and our inner child comes through.  Yellow, metal desks are lined up next to the\
  \ window, perfect for doing homework and eating an afternoon snack. A green and\
  \ purple play area tucked away in the corner. The toys and stuffed animals all neatly\
  \ organized on their shelves. Rusted metal steps lead up to a small library. The\
  \ playfulness of the space makes you almost hear the children playing and laughing.\n\
  We are standing in the children\u2019s playroom of the Museo dell'Altro e dell'Altrove\
  \ di Metropoliz (MAAM). A community of the displaced is one way to describe the\
  \ MAAM. A museum made by and inside the homes of migrants and unemployed people.\
  \  An abandoned slaughterhouse where about 200 squatters and hundreds of works of\
  \ art reside in, has turned into Italy\u2019s most diverse and inclusive museum.\
  \ \nThe vibrancy of the playroom mimics life throughout the complex. Giant murals\
  \ decorate the outside walls. A concrete courtyard is outlined by graffiti and cement\
  \ houses. The first floor is a maze of installations and paintings floating in between\
  \ communal areas, like kitchens and meeting places, which surprisingly hides the\
  \ factory\u2019s original use. This is a home, which turned to art as its saviour.\
  \  \n\tThe art isn\u2019t constrained by age, language, experience, or critics.\
  \ With volunteers and Saturdays open to the public keeping this place going, the\
  \ MAAM is truly the definition of what community and humanity look like. However,\
  \ with all of this good why can\u2019t these artists and members leave these walls?\
  \ Because the real world isn\u2019t as welcoming. The beauty that lies within this\
  \ building is a necessity for the survival of its residents since their humanity\
  \ has been taken away. They no longer have a land to call home, a bed to lay to\
  \ rest peacefully and stability knowing things are safe. Polarity in our society\
  \ today, where immigrants are immediately deemed not human and unwanted in countries\
  \ that see themselves as better than the rest, strip individuals of these rights.\
  \ \n\tIt is deeply original for people in Italy to find common ground through art.\
  \ Could this happen in other countries? Has it? Can it happen in the United States?\
  \ My mind wonders. What could the American MAAM look like? All the answers are not\
  \ in Rome but it is a testimony to the power of community.  As our worlds grow closer,\
  \ we will all have to find the humanity in one another, through conversation, ideas\
  \ or art. Museo dell'Altro e dell'Altrove di Metropoliz is just a small experience.\
  \ However an experience worth having to find your humanity and redefine the power\
  \ of art and culture."
