Text: "Upon arriving in Cape Town, I was obviously very keen to get myself up it's\
  \ most famous, and grandiose, landmark - Table Mountain. There are several options\
  \ to scale the 1085 metre plateau that the city surrounds - the most popular being\
  \ by cable car, which only takes about 5 minutes excluding the usual 2 hour queuing\
  \ time at the bottom. \nThing is, I hate doing anything the way anyone else does\
  \ it. I\u2019ve got to be different. And I\u2019ve GOT to go home with an adventure\
  \ story. \nWe can all be a bit obsessed with 'not being a tourist', which is technically\
  \ a little odd when you're in a foreign land because you are, in fact, a tourist.\
  \ And what's more, the 'touristy' things are often touristy for reason, for example,\
  \ humongous historical importance. If you came back from Paris and told me you didn't\
  \ see the Eiffel Tower, frankly I'd think you were mental.  \nBut I am totally guilty\
  \ of this quirk, so to scale this unmissable monument I decided I simply must take\
  \ the least recommended route: \nAfter minimal research online owing to a bad international\
  \ data plan, I chose to walk up \u2018India Venster\u2019, known for being a physically\
  \ challenging and dangerous scrambling route, only to taken with a guide. Unlike\
  \ the other walking routes up Table Mountain, chains and staples (whatever the hell\
  \ they are) are involved, as well as sheer edges. As someone who is terrified of\
  \ heights, this was almost certainly a terrible idea. \nI had met three fabulous\
  \ ladies on my journey from Namibia, and as a quartet of stubborn adventurers we\
  \ were up at 6am ready to go, having ignored the requests of overzealous men from\
  \ the hostel to join us. Like a bad joke, one English, one Welsh, one Aussie, one\
  \ German set off up a mountain. (But then, these friendships (I still see the fabulous\
  \ humans) are what solo travel is all about.) \nOn the short taxi ride from town\
  \ to the base, we asked the taxi driver what route he liked best to walk up the\
  \ mountain in his hometown. He veritably snorted. \u2018'I\u2019ve never walked\
  \ up!\u2019\u2019 he declared, as if we had asked which route to the moon was most\
  \ scenic. \nEven at this hour the epic queue for the cable car steadied our resolve,\
  \ so we veered from the path that began the Platteklip gorge route (the most direct,\
  \ and accessible way to walk up). After a very steep initial climb that got us all\
  \ wondering why we didn't go tot he gym, we came across a family having a picnic\
  \ (for breakfast?), who immediately warned us that we absolutely could not go up\
  \ that route by ourselves. The patronising tone, while I\u2019m sure very well meant,\
  \ resulted in a Girl Power moment that spurred us onward and, literally, upward.\
  \ \nRomantic travel tale aside, India Venster is not an easy route to climb. The\
  \ path is marked only by sporadically painted yellow footprints on the rocks. What\
  \ it does have, is the best views you\u2019ll get in Cape Town. When you aren\u2019\
  t clinging on for dear life, stop to take in the utterly breathtaking panoramic\
  \ of the Atlantic that surrounds you, as the unexpectedly bohemian city sweeps the\
  \ coast beneath you.  \nAs the roue is ill-advised we didn\u2019t pass another human\
  \ on our whole 4 hour hike. Our excessive bravado even resulted in a naked selfie,\
  \ which we couldn\u2019t resist when we paused in the warm sun on a Pride-Rock shaped\
  \ outcrop. \nFinally rounding the mountain to the West side you are rewarded with\
  \ blooming shrubs and a whole new set of vistas before finding yourself on the unearthly\
  \ flat top of this world wonder. \nWhatever route you take, you can easily spend\
  \ hours up here, dashing around to take in better and better views, or simply relax\
  \ and eat your warm and mushy sandwiches. I\u2019m probably not allowed to recommend\
  \ you climb India Venster unaccompanied - a lawsuit will be coming my way. But I\
  \ do say to follow that the sense of adventure, and the desire to be curious, that\
  \ fills your soul - you just don\u2019t know where it will take you."
