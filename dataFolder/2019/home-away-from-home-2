Text: "About 90km north of Bangkok, Ayutthaya sits on its own little island surrounded\
  \ by three rivers, whispering of its glory days as a royal capital. Now saved as\
  \ a UNESCO World Heritage Site, this splendid ruin is filled with palaces, temples\
  \ and religious monuments of great historical and cultural significance.\n\nThe\
  \ road to sala ayutthaya resort from Bangkok was an impressive mix of lush greenery\
  \ and picturesque pagodas, giving me a quick glimpse of Ayutthaya\u2019s faded history.\n\
  \nAt the entrance of the boutique resort was a large iron door that opened upon\
  \ an expansive terracotta brickwork wall with the property\u2019s name and logo\
  \ accented in gold. This was the perfect introduction into the resort\u2019s historic\
  \ architectural theme. \n\nStepping inside, I was mesmerised by the striking interior\
  \ which elegantly displayed post-modern artworks and traditional symbols of Thai\
  \ culture. Upon waiting to check-in, I was immediately given refreshing fruity drinks,\
  \ while the friendly staff organised the details of my stay with experienced efficiency,\
  \ after which I was escorted to my room.\n\nThe redbrick passage on my way mimicked\
  \ the ancient Ayutthaya\u2019s outer walls featuring masterful local craftsmanship.\
  \ Divided into 12 individual homes, the gently curved terracotta-coloured walls\
  \ were designed to offer visitors privacy, while the stark white walls provided\
  \ a visually pleasing contrast.\n\nWith a total of 26 spacious guestrooms and suites,\
  \ the immaculate property embodies comfort and style to become one of the most Instagram-worthy\
  \ spots in the city. Every room was well-equipped with handy amenities, stunning\
  \ viewpoints and meditative spaces that are delightful for families, couples, and\
  \ solo travellers alike. The wood-accented rooms extend onto a small but nicely\
  \ formed marble pool, which is a base camp for fun, and therefore, has both children\
  \ and adults addicted.\nUpon checking into my 40sqm superior guestroom, I was quick\
  \ to make myself at home in the incredibly comfortable king-sized bed, which was\
  \ lined with a cosy daybed.\nThe room with its subtle homey touches and snug furnishings\
  \ is also blessed with in-room entertainment and world-class amenities, including\
  \ a 32-inch Smart TV, stereo sound system and complimentary Wi-Fi.\nMeanwhile, the\
  \ elegantly decorated bathroom boasts a ceiling-mounted shower head and a round\
  \ bathtub, which is the focal point of the large well-lit area.\n\nOverlooking the\
  \ magnificent Chao Phraya River and Wat Phutthaisawan, eatery and bar is sala ayutthaya\u2019\
  s beautiful riverfront restaurant that answers all your culinary prayers with their\
  \ extensive menu that consists of traditional Thai favourites, as well as a variety\
  \ of international delights. The bar features a fine selection of wines, beers and\
  \ cocktails crafted by expert mixologists.\n\nOffering both indoor and outdoor seating\
  \ arrangements, the eatery\u2019s interior showcases several bell-shaped granite\
  \ lamps suspended from exposed electric cables, providing a striking contrast to\
  \ the restaurant\u2019s modern d\xE9cor. I was seated at the intimate riverside\
  \ terrace where I savoured mouth-watering dishes from their \xE0 la carte menu,\
  \ including Seafood tom yum soup, Kraphao kai and Thai red curry with duck. The\
  \ meal ended on a sweet note with Mango and sticky rice accompanied by a plate full\
  \ of tropical fruits. \nThe next day, I enjoyed a complimentary breakfast which\
  \ offers both a premium quality buffet and an \xE0 la carte menu. I opted for the\
  \ Light breakfast \xE0 la carte option, which consisted of egg whites, buttered\
  \ toast, roasted asparagus, mushrooms and a juicy tomato.\n\n\nThanks to the resort\u2019\
  s central location, guests also have a plethora of outside excursions to look forward\
  \ to. These include temple visits and historical sites. The resort\u2019s staff\
  \ are also eager to assist with different excursions available, including bicycle\
  \ tours and river cruises. Just like sala ayutthaya, all of these activities are\
  \ well-equipped to cater to their patrons\u2019 needs.\n\n\nTravel Tip: To make\
  \ your experience more meaningful, do a little background research beforehand to\
  \ provide yourself with some historical context. Or you can visit Ayutthaya Historical\
  \ Study Centre once there to get an overview with informative facts, models and\
  \ old photographs."
