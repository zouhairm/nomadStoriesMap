Text: "I caught the travel bug early in my life and had the aspiration to seek adventure\
  \ in search of something different. There was only one problem; I didn't have anyone\
  \ to go with. Rather than changing my goals, I changed my plans instead, and made\
  \ the decision to go it alone. Girl Power!\n\nDirectly after finishing high school,\
  \ I was working three jobs, studying at university, and trying to save as much money\
  \ as I could to start travelling. It wasn't until I had finished my degree and started\
  \ a career that I decided to officially take the plunge and go on my first solo\
  \ trip. Although there were things I would do differently if I were to go back,\
  \ this trip completely changed my life. Not only did I meet the couple who I would\
  \ eventually live with in Canada, but it also gave me the confidence to finally\
  \ rely on myself. \n\nI always knew that I was a very social and independent person\
  \ - but travelling solo presented opportunities and challenges that sparked personal\
  \ growth that otherwise wouldn't have been possible. I was completely out of my\
  \ comfort zone and I absolutely loved it. Taking a solo trip is a huge step in discovering\
  \ your true self. I know it sounds cliche, but it's exactly what happens when you're\
  \ alone, meeting new people and experiencing things for the first time. Before I\
  \ left to travel solo, I know the majority of my family and friends didn't think\
  \ I was going to last longer than four months. I was so close to those around me\
  \ that I never truly understood the impact it had until I started travelling the\
  \ world on my own. I finally started doing things that I wanted to do and began\
  \ learning so much about myself.\n\nYou have no choice but to depend on yourself\
  \ and I'm positive it will bring out qualities that you never even knew you had.\
  \ It allows you to finally be yourself and gives you the ultimate surge of confidence\
  \ that you can do anything you want. The incredible people and places you will discover\
  \ is simply the cherry on top. I have met some of my closest friends travelling\
  \ around on a bus, or while I was island hopping in Thailand. It's not about the\
  \ time you spend with new friends, but the moments and experiences you share together.\
  \ And if you still aren't convinced, all of these new friends will now mean free\
  \ accommodation wherever you decide to visit in the future!\n\nI've learned to love\
  \ spending time with myself. Whether it's sitting in a restaurant having dinner\
  \ alone, or walking around exploring an entire city. My phone gets put away, the\
  \ book goes back in my bag, and I try to just breathe and be in the moment as much\
  \ as I can. There is a feeling of empowerment that I haven't been able to replicate\
  \ and I promise when you return home, you will like the changes you see. You'll\
  \ return home full of adventure, confidence, and with enough stories to keep any\
  \ boy entertained long enough to steal his heart!\n\nI know the idea of one day\
  \ possibly travelling alone may be intimidating and even scary to think about, but\
  \ start by doing your research and trusting your gut instinct. Make sure you have\
  \ somewhere to stay on your first few nights and know exactly how to get from the\
  \ airport to your accommodation. I've also found it extremely helpful to bring locks\
  \ with me wherever I go. You never know when you're going to need one!\n\nThere\
  \ is nothing quite like the feeling of knowing that you survived of this magnitude,\
  \ all by yourself. For me, it started with wanting to travel to as many countries\
  \ as I could. I chose not to wait for anyone else or put my dreams on hold because\
  \ I didn't have a travel partner. This was one of the most profound and impactful\
  \ experiences of self-discovery and empowerment that I wish upon every girl struggling\
  \ to find her identity or purpose. Get out and start travelling girl, stop waiting\
  \ for the perfect moment or perfect opportunity. It doesn't exist."
