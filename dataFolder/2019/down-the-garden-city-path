Text: "Let me get this out of the way at the start -- the best key lime pie I\u2019\
  ve ever isn\u2019t found in the Florida Keys. I realize this is a controversial\
  \ if not downright blasphemous thing to write, but it\u2019s true. \nLet it be known,\
  \ too, that I have sat in the sand in those Keys with a slice of key lime pie, dipped\
  \ my feet in both the Atlantic and the Gulf of Mexico, and still am convinced that\
  \ there is no better place for key lime pie than a small, seasonally open oceanside\
  \ cafe in Garden City, South Carolina.\n---\nMy plane is wheels down in Myrtle Beach,\
  \ land of mini golf, boardwalks, and bright lights, but it\u2019s wheels down when\
  \ most Grand Strand vacationers have yet to invade. Moreover, it\u2019s not the\
  \ glowing SkyWheel towering over the coast that calls to me, nor is it the twentieth-floor\
  \ balcony of a sprawling resort. My ultimate destination is far more ordinary, more\
  \ muted, especially in early March before spring break turns this low-key paradise\
  \ into something busy and boisterous.\nJust north of Murrells Inlet, a formerly\
  \ sleepy fishing town straddling Georgetown and Horry Counties, lies Garden City,\
  \ a town that brings sun-faded souvenir postcard pictures to life. Houses dressed\
  \ in vibrant oranges, pinks, blues and greens stand on stilts along the old highway,\
  \ offering vistas of, and protection from, the swelling sea, the rolling dunes,\
  \ and the wooden pier jutting into the ocean. My father\u2019s rental apartment\
  \ is dusky blue cinderblock, with a practically identical upstairs pad my family\
  \ takes over for a week each spring. \nJust across the road is the beach, typically\
  \ empty save for a handful of dog walkers, a few groups of beachwear-clad teenagers\
  \ willing to weather all conditions, and our fellow snowbirds. \nPerhaps more importantly,\
  \ a brisk mile down the shore brings into vision the sight of deep green plastic\
  \ chairs and blue-striped umbrellas: the Conch Cafe. \nYou will not be enjoying\
  \ fresh-caught deep-sea fish at market prices at the Conch. What you will be enjoying,\
  \ if you heed my advice: a spectacular view, piping hot grouper fingers (don\u2019\
  t forget the horseradish dip), several pints of Blue Moon garnished with juicy orange\
  \ wedges. And, at the end, when you think you can\u2019t possibly eat anything else,\
  \ when you think it\u2019s time to stumble back down the beach to put your feet\
  \ up and sleep off the sun and the beer, order the key lime pie. \nThe tame, creamy\
  \ yellow-green of each slice belies the intensity of its flavour, all citrus explosion\
  \ flecked with sugary clumps of graham cracker crust. Quickly dipping a fork into\
  \ the dollop of barely-sweet whipped cream resting on top is enough to tame the\
  \ pucker. \nSometimes while we linger over our pints and pie we see boats passing\
  \ beyond the white railing of the cafe\u2019s deck, which is freshly coated with\
  \ another gleaming layer of paint each season before the restaurant opens and the\
  \ crowds descend, tourists and locals alike. Our visits usually coincide with opening\
  \ weekend. \nIf my pie is a vessel like the ones entering and exiting the inlet,\
  \ I\u2019m slowly working my way to its stern, trying to savour every morsel because\
  \ it\u2019s not just a flavour, it\u2019s also a feeling. This place is our hangout\
  \ for just a handful of days each year, but every year it feels -- and tastes --\
  \ like the most familiar kind of satisfaction.\nThose last bites are both the best\
  \ and the worst; the best because the final forkfuls have the most crunchy, sweet\
  \ crumbs mixed with that tangy filling, and the worst because, well, I\u2019m out\
  \ of pie."
