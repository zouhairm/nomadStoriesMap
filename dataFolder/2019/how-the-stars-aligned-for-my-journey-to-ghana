Text: "I didn\u2019t know when I started planning my trip in early 2018 that there\
  \ would be a big push for African Americans to return to Ghana just the following\
  \ year. 2019 has been coined \u201CYear of Return\u201D by the Ghanaian tourism\
  \ board. \n\nIt\u2019s the year requesting that African Americans come \u2018home\u2019\
  \ for a visit, 400 years since the gruesome, horrific and life-altering Transatlantic\
  \ Slave Trade, which transported somewhere between 10 million to 12 million Africans\
  \ across the Atlantic Ocean to the Americas. \n\nIronically enough, I conducted\
  \ a DNA test a couple of years prior and decided after learning that my lineage\
  \ was over 20% Ghanaian, that I had to explore Ghana. \n\nUpon my arrival, I instantly\
  \ felt at home. Zipping through the immigration process swiftly and having the customs\
  \ agent reply \u201Cwelcome home sister.\u201D \n\nAfter getting the much awaited\
  \ Ghanaian passport stamp and feeling a sense of glee, my joy continued to overflow\
  \ as I heard the live jazz band playing a roaring, upbeat melody of piano strings\
  \ and bustling horn tunes in the airport hall.\n\nI thought to myself, \u201Cwell\
  \ this is a first!\u201D In the almost 50 countries I\u2019ve visited, I had never\
  \ seen a live band greeting people at the airport in the baggage claim area. My\
  \ next thought was, \u201Cnow this is the kind of greeting a girl can get used to.\u201D\
  \ This all further extended my beliefs that the time is now, this is where I\u2019\
  m meant to be in this moment. \n\nEven though my initial \u2018homecoming\u2019\
  \ reactions were filled with glee and excitement, these were not the emotions that\
  \ were felt throughout my trip. \n\nOne of the main reasons I desired to visit Ghana\
  \ was to become entranced by the massive slave castles along the coast. The coast\
  \ once coined the Gold Coast, transitioned to the slave coast, in order to forcibly\
  \ export African bodies to lands in the Americas. \n\nI needed to stand in the pain.\
  \ I needed to feel the horror that my ancestors faced hundreds of years prior. The\
  \ eerie feeling upon entering Cape Coast Castle was a slow ache, becoming more and\
  \ more menacing the more I approached the dungeons. \n\nMy guide explained the lineage\
  \ of the slave trade as we stood outside of the male dungeons, which he told me\
  \ could hold 800 African bodies. \n\nAs we entered the dungeon, the first thing\
  \ I noticed was the overarching stench. It was as if death was still upon those\
  \ underground dungeon walls. I couldn\u2019t even phantom how hundreds of years\
  \ later, the smell could still be so strong, so flagrant flowing through my nostrils.\
  \ \n\nMy guide pointed out that there was one single, minuscule opening in the dungeon,\
  \ where a ray of light shined through. The dungeon was brightly lit with installed\
  \ light fixtures to lead our way through the encompassing walls of the chambers.\
  \ \n\nOnce my guide told me to stay put, as I was the sole body on his tour, he\
  \ strolled back to the entry to shut off the lights so I could get a feel for what\
  \ it was like for the slaves back hundreds of years ago, standing tightly clenched\
  \ in the cold, damp cells. \n\nIn that moment as the lights went off and I stood\
  \ dead in the center of the underground dungeon chambers, I instantly broke down.\
  \ The tears shed uncontrollably, with a shiver of cold streaming down my back. \n\
  \nI could feel my and many others\u2019 ancestors at that moment. My guide came\
  \ back and in an attempt to comfort me, gave me a soft hug replying \u201Cit\u2019\
  s ok sister, It\u2019s ok.\u201D \n\nAs I exited the chambers and felt the sunshine\
  \ hit my once cold skin, I decided it only right to hold my head high. I did what\
  \ many others were not able to do in this Year of Return. \n\nIt was a full circle\
  \ moment to walk freely through the slave castle that once transported my ancestors\
  \ to the Americas. At that moment, I felt truly free, determined to continue to\
  \ be and live out my ancestor\u2019s wildest dreams."
