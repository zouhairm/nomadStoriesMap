Text: "Sitting in the back of a worn-out, dusty taxi our guide had hired for us, we\
  \ set off from the Yangon docks towards Ngwesaung beach. The smell of rust and the\
  \ bumpy, neglected roads mirrored the outskirts of a city long forgotten by multiple\
  \ regimes more concerned with personal wealth than helping out a struggling people.\
  \ Our guide spoke about the Tsunami that decimated his country and family, leaving\
  \ him to be in charge of his siblings at 10 years old and the struggle of the country\
  \ to bounce back after such a horrible tragedy. He spoke of the lack of help from\
  \ a corrupt government that imprisoned or killed people who did what they had to\
  \ just to survive and how tough it had been for all of Myanmar since the tsunami.\n\
  \nAs he talked, I looked around at the hauntingly beautiful scenery of abandoned\
  \ colonial buildings being reclaimed by the land as we wound our way down the suburban\
  \ roads, unable to believe the horrors the Burmese people must have seen. Suddenly,\
  \ all talk in the car stopped as we approached a bridge that stuck out like a sore\
  \ on an otherwise silent landscape. Our guide quickly reminded us that we couldn\u2019\
  t say he was our guide as we lurched towards barbed wire fences, gleaming like claws\
  \ in the moonlight, strewn across the bridge. Armed men in uniforms waved us down\
  \ and approached the car, yelling at our driver and guide to get out before dragging\
  \ them out of the car and roughly shoving them against the windows at gunpoint.\
  \ As their attention fell towards us in the backseat, the pleading of our guide\
  \ was drowned out by their shouts for our passports and our reason for leaving the\
  \ city. We handed over our passports and after what felt like hours, they were handed\
  \ back to us as our driver and guide retreated back into the car. We continued on\
  \ towards the coast.\n\nVast fields and farmlands popped up as we left the city\
  \ and the quiet sound of Bollywood music played from the radio into the still night,\
  \ contrary to the uneasiness in the cab. Shaken, we asked about the checkpoints\
  \ only to receive tempered responses hinting at rebellion and ethnic cleansing in\
  \ the north and how these were dangerous subjects to talk about, even in private.\
  \ We rode on in silence looking out into the oppressive darkness of a countryside\
  \ that suddenly seemed more sinister than silent. \u201CAung San Suu Kyi will change\
  \ things.\u201D Our guide suddenly muttered, breaking the silence of the car. Taken\
  \ aback, we asked him what he meant, only to be met with a hope-filled smile as\
  \ he turned around to us and repeated \u201CAung San Suu Kyi will change things.\u201D\
  \n\nThe sun rose as we descended the hills towards the beach, washing away the night\
  \ before as we quickly got lost in the childlike revelry of Ngwesaung beach. The\
  \ sounds of fishermen launching boats and drunk tourists playing in the shallows\
  \ shed a different light on the Myanmar we had seen held in the darkness of the\
  \ night before.\n \nThat was three years ago now and reports of change are few and\
  \ far between with reported attacks by rebels in the north and the military happening\
  \ as recently as a few weeks ago. It is a bleak predicament for Burmese people but\
  \ I\u2019ll never forget the hope that radiated from his smile for a country on\
  \ the verge of civil war to find peace"
