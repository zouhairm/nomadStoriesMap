Text: "I wept in front of twenty eight strangers at the Auschwitz-Birkenau Memorial.\
  \ How naive I was to imagine that I could visit a memorial to such pain and suffering\
  \ and not be overcome by emotion. I was holding it together fairly well but could\
  \ no longer contain my sobs when confronted with a glass wall behind which was a\
  \ large room filled with the hair shaved off the many thousands of female victims\
  \ exterminated by the Nazi regime. We passed rooms filled with empty suitcases where\
  \ I paused to read some of the hand written names and addresses of people who had\
  \ carefully identified belongings which would never be collected. And then there\
  \ were the rooms filled with shoes; men\u2019s, women\u2019s and the tiny shoes\
  \ of so many children. I had factually known the number of people killed at the\
  \ camps, but knowing it and seeing such personal evidence of the magnitude of this\
  \ horror are different things.\n\nIt is a drab and sombre place, but not extraordinarily\
  \ so. It is neat. The neatness a testament to the orderliness and efficiency of\
  \ the operation carried out here. It was also cold, however rugged up in my down\
  \ jacket, hat and scarf, I could not even begin to comprehend the cold endured by\
  \ prisoners, standing for hours in temperatures as low as minus twenty in what was\
  \ essentially cotton pajamas. Our guide was very informative, relating the facts\
  \ of what the short life of a prisoner here would have been like - the suffering,\
  \ both physical and mental. She described the process of exterminating over one\
  \ million people with a clinical detachment, not revealing a lack of compassion\
  \ but, rather, an honorable facade of professionalism in the face of immense injustice.\
  \ She did not sugar-coat anything and nor should she. Why should we be shielded\
  \ from the truth when so many innocent people were not shielded from the brutality?\
  \ \n\nI have lived on this planet long enough that death is no longer a stranger\
  \ to me. I have lost family and friends to painful and violent deaths.  However,\
  \ their suffering was short-lived, or they were provided with the comfort of love\
  \ and compassion. There was little compassion evidenced here and the pain and fear\
  \ felt by those tortured prisoners lasted until a merciful death. We were told that\
  \ many prisoners threw themselves onto the electrified fence to end their misery.\
  \ We were shown the sleeping quarters containing what were crowded, lice infected\
  \ bunk beds. The top bunk was the most sought after as dysentery meant that those\
  \ sleeping on the bottom often got covered in feaces during the night. We were also\
  \ taken through the gas chamber. This was a large concrete room where, we were told,\
  \ prisoners went dutifully expecting a shower, until the first canister of poisonous\
  \ gas dropped through the ceiling.  After about twenty minutes the screams and wailing\
  \ would cease.\n\nThe return journey back to Krakow was a quiet one. I imagine the\
  \ other tour participants felt much like myself; raw and drained. Yet I am not sorry\
  \ that I have visited, as gut wrenching as the experience was. I have traveled the\
  \ world, seen and done many things and been stirred by various sights and experiences.\
  \ I recall looking up at Mount Everest from Base Camp and marveling at this magnificent\
  \ planet and feeling such gratitude for my life.  But this experience affected me\
  \ more than any other. I had expected it to be heartbreaking, but I did not know\
  \ that it would be one of those experiences which would alter me. I had not fully\
  \ comprehended the human capacity for evil and cruelty until faced with the unadorned\
  \ description accompanying the physical testimony to it. If you get the opportunity,\
  \ visit. I warn you that it is not an easy thing to do, no harbor cruise, but the\
  \ lesson is an important one:  we must be very careful to not let seeds of hate\
  \ be sewn and never allow ourselves to become indifferent to injustice."
