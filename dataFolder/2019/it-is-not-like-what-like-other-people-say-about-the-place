Text: "A lot people that have been to Gobang village before always discourage me to\
  \ do my research and community services in that village because of a lot reasons;\
  \ some of them claim that the villagers at Gobang wasn't too keen to outsiders,\
  \ some thinks that the people of Gobang Village only take financial advantages to\
  \ kind hearted students who want to develop rural areas using the knowledge that\
  \ they have gained in their classrooms, some of them thinks that the village is\
  \ run by corrupt government officials so it means that we need to face them in order\
  \ to bring changes to the village. \n\nThe list goes on and on but I won't back\
  \ down that easily because of stories while knowing that this village is one of\
  \ the most undeveloped village in my province and decided to pay a visit to learn\
  \ more about the place.\n\nGobang Village can't be reach by four wheeled vehicles\
  \ the only option to get there is by riding motorcycle, the journey takes a 3 hour\
  \ drive from my university, while it seems that it takes forever but the REAL challenge\
  \ is awaiting ahead. When we arrive at Rumpin I find out about the real reason why\
  \ we can't take cars to Gobang, it is because the village itself is located in the\
  \ mountain range and the only way up is by a one lane road made of nothing but grass\
  \ and mud.\n\n\"This ought to be fun\" said one of the volunteers that came along,\
  \ but for myself, I've been analyzing the terrain how we can avoid all the slip\
  \ and slides in order to get to the village; and my prediction was right, we DO\
  \ have to get slipped, bruises and tugging of a broke down motorcycle. But all that\
  \ struggle was worth it, we arrived in a hidden village in the mountain range.\n\
  \nAt first it seems like a ghost town, nobody can be seen in the village but we\
  \ learn later on that by the time that we arrive villagers usually can be seen at\
  \ the rice fields or at the barn milking cow. While we are resting at one the the\
  \ Saung one of the villagers approach us because the way we looks and dress looks\
  \ unfamiliar to them, after small chat of stating our business here the villager\
  \ goes to get the Tokoh Masyarakat and Kepala Desa which means the village chiefs.\n\
  \nThey offer us their homegrown coffee and Umbi-Umbian to eat and drink which is\
  \ quite nice of them actually despiting the stories I've heard about the village,\
  \ I also tell them that the reason that I am here is for research purposes in order\
  \ to conduct a community service programme in rural undeveloped villages and guess\
  \ what is their response? they will gladly help my research and socialize the villagers\
  \ about the programs that I will conduct here.\n\nAnother twist of the turn that\
  \ I'm not expecting because I was expecting the kind of people who is not keen to\
  \ outsiders, but no, they are kind and have this warm welcoming attitude.\n\nThey\
  \ ask us to stay the night so they can show their rice paddies and barns, but unfortunately\
  \ I wasn't able to stay because I have class tommorow. They are asking us when will\
  \ we visit again so they can give us a more detailed tours in order to gain more\
  \ research data, \"Soon. soon we will be back\" is what I said during our goodbye.\n\
  \nWhile on our way back home on the motorcycle I was thinking, they might been so\
  \ happy because finally have people that wants to reach out and have the means to\
  \ help them to get out of their poor conditions, the reason why they are not keen\
  \ to outsiders is because how the outsiders interact with the villagers seems impolite,\
  \ the can't blend in with local cultures while thinking of one size fits all of\
  \ interacting, by any other way that is accepted by the locals.\n\nI think will\
  \ be back to Gobang soon to find data about the local goverments, the one that most\
  \ people think is corrupted."
