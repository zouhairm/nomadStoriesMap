Text: "The red rose on the floor was what most captivated my attention. In that moment,\
  \ the acclaimed tibetan mantra \u2013 om mani padme hum \u2013 truly made sense\
  \ to me. Out of the mud is born the lotus flower. And that flower, so delicate and\
  \ gracious, had also been born out of hideous circumstances. \nThe rose was part\
  \ of the Resistante Memorial exhibition, in S\xE3o Paulo, not only Brazil\u2019\
  s most populated city, but also all South America\u2019s. For a small town girl\
  \ like me, it mixes chaos and wonder in the right amount, causing a fascination\
  \ and astonishment effect, which made me appreciate even the city degradation aspects,\
  \ such as intense noise pollution, stinking streets and overcrowding transportation\
  \ facilities.\nVisiting there was a choice made by mere convenience. My friend and\
  \ I had been to some sights, but we still had free time left, to which he suggested\
  \ the Memorial, because it was close and we could walk. Not knowing the city and\
  \ a little exhausted from the long buses and subways routes, that could take longer\
  \ than the tour itself, I immediately agreed. \nThe Memorial was built with the\
  \ intention of preserving the country political repression memories, and it took\
  \ place where once was the DEOPS headquartes \u2013 a department created to refrain\
  \ political and social commotions, currently associated with a dark period of fear\
  \ and oppression. The place structure was quite simple; at the entrance, there were\
  \ writings on the walls and televisons exhibiting historical facts. Further on there\
  \ were letters written by relatives of political prisoners. In the central hall,\
  \ there was a little prison model in which the arrested were incarcereted.\nAt first\
  \ glance, the model made me think of a slaughterhouse. And slaughterhouses, on the\
  \ other hand \u2013 being a vegetarian \u2013, have always reminded me the World\
  \ War II concentration camps. The associations occurred so instinctively that it\u2019\
  s likely that at the time I didn\u2019t even realize where my mind was wandering.\
  \ After the model, there was a life-size representation of the prison. It was a\
  \ shadowy and narrow aisle leading to the cells and another aisle, even narrower,\
  \ leading to the sunbathing area, which the prisoners had access to once a week\
  \ for an hour of the day.  \nThat was when it occurred to me that I sunbathed every\
  \ day, and the idea of having it taken away from me seemed absurd. I felt a lump\
  \ in my throat and a shiver in my body, as if a cold breeze had just passed by \u2013\
  \ something logically impossible in a space so sultry. Inside the cells, ex-prisoners\u2019\
  \ audios were being reproduced, recounting the stories of how did they end up there,\
  \ in such subhuman conditions, because of an oppressive government that suppressed\
  \ any fight for democracy and social justice. \nAnd, in the last cell, there was\
  \ a rose on the floor. Symbol of hope, perhaps. Of resistance. Of nonconformity.\
  \ Of any feeling extremely difficult to cultivate in a filthy and tiny cell. That\
  \ rose, so vivid, so impetuous, so present, made me realize the Memorial, after\
  \ all, didn\u2019t guard memories that old. Brazil emerged from a military dictatorship\
  \ only 34 years ago and has just democratically elected a president who disseminates\
  \ antidemocratic, homophobic, racist and sexist speeches. In a country whose major\
  \ representative publicly affirms that only a new dictatorship or a civil war could\
  \ make the nation thrive, that prison \u2013 slaughterhouse, concentration camp\
  \ \u2013 was an alarming warning of what\u2019s at stake. And that rose, so unexpected,\
  \ was the symbol of the tenacity needed to face the next 4 years of government without\
  \ regressing 34. \nThe visit to the Memorial may have left a weight on my heart\
  \ and clouded the rest of the day, but it also left me with the courage needed to\
  \ face the latest election result. When unjustly convicted, coincidentally, Oscar\
  \ Wilde wrote: \u201CWith freedom, books, flowers and the moon, who could not be\
  \ happy?\u201D. Books, flowers and the moon were daily companionship to me, and\
  \ a source of genuine delight. Freedom, on the other hand, was something I have\
  \ always taken for granted. But I would come home from my trip with the resolution\
  \ to never do it again."
