Text: "All I ever knew in Texas and Louisiana, were roller rinks, flat landscapes,\
  \ and playing tag outside with my friends after school. So asking me such a broad\
  \ question like, \u201CWhat do you think California is like?\u201D Wouldn\u2019\
  t have resulted in much of a real answer other than a stereotypical response. I\
  \ used to think California was known for their palm trees, Hollywood movie stars,\
  \ expensive mansions, and high-class lifestyle. But I never really considered their\
  \ beaches. There were none where I grew up. The closest thing that I had known to\
  \ the beach was the pool, and I couldn\u2019t even swim at the time. So, technically,\
  \ the closest thing to a beach that I really knew was the shower.\n\n          I\u2019\
  ve always been the type of person that was overly cautious but somehow that wouldn\u2019\
  t stop me from skipping into an open door with \u201COPPORTUNITY\u201D branded on\
  \ it . One day, my mom got us all up and told us, \u201CGet dressed in something\
  \ you\u2019d wear outside.\u201D It hadn\u2019t even been 3 weeks! We did as she\
  \ told and a moment later, we were on the freeway. It was a first, but I found the\
  \ freeway to be quite beautiful that day. We were driving down a slope when we were\
  \ suddenly struck by the beautiful view of the city before us, somehow framed by\
  \ the grass edges of the road. I couldn\u2019t keep my eyes off the window because\
  \ I was taking it all in, there was so much that I hadn\u2019t seen before. I felt\
  \ that I would miss it all if I looked away.\n\n         My mom eventually decided\
  \ to reveal where we were before the coastline, docked boats, saltwater scent, roller\
  \ coasters, and food mart\u2019s gave it away. Imagine if she hadn\u2019t told us,\
  \ we would\u2019ve been clueless! Parking was an especially crazy experience because,\
  \ where I\u2019m from, lots are hardly ever packed unless you were at the County\
  \ Fair. It took about seven minutes to soak it all in, but I still remember the\
  \ way my heart rate skyrocketed after the reveal. I remember the excitement and\
  \ curiosity of being somewhere different and learning something new. I wanted to\
  \ run around and explore it all like the little kid I was. I was surprised that\
  \ the rest of my family were taking their time unpacking the car, and I suspected\
  \ that my mom had conspired to make the wait that much longer, sneaky lady.\nI remember\
  \ the way the breeze caressed my body, the smell of the saltwater slapping my face,\
  \ as we finally walked to the sand. The burning sensation when we finally stepped\
  \ in didn\u2019t last nearly as long as I had thought. My senses were completely\
  \ overwhelmed that day. The music was like the Pied Piper, luring the skaters to\
  \ follow its sound. The sweet, savory, home-style aroma from our food.\n\n     \
  \   No matter where I looked, there were people from all walks of life, from all\
  \ corners of the imagination. All ages, all colors, and all sizes. This was California.\
  \ There is a reason why people give this state such high expectations for their\
  \ people, and this is why: their carefree attitudes, their reception to optimism,\
  \ and their well-balanced egos. All qualities I found rare, and all qualities I\
  \ admire deeply. They lived in the moment, somehow balancing fun with their family\
  \ and friends and also giving themselves time to just be. It was a true eye-opener.\
  \ The way that they carried themselves led a lasting impression on how I view myself,\
  \ and how I managed to, later on, make a new life here.\n\n        California allowed\
  \ me to recognize confidence within myself and in a lot of aspects I felt I lacked.\
  \ I thank the Californian people for the lasting impact they left on me as that\
  \ day on the beach as that first impression is what I use to move forward into my\
  \ adulthood."
