Text: "A travel abroad makes a person change fully in a way that the growing sometimes\
  \ can be unthinkable. \nMy experience was in 2016, my first trip abroad, my first\
  \ interaction 24x7 with native english speaker's, it was remarkable. In Canada what\
  \ first got was how people are respectiful with each other, in the buses they say\
  \ \"Good Morning\" to the Driver when get in and \"Thank You\" when leaves it, I\
  \ saw this happening with almost everyone that I paid attention to, I learned in\
  \ this days that doen't matter how bad your day is going, sometimes people only\
  \ need simple things like small, but tremendous powerful words from a stranger that\
  \ can make your day happy and show that people are still taking care of each other\
  \ and it is a treasure chest.\nAnother day I went in Vancouver Aquarium, it is a\
  \ really amazing amazing place to see wild life, happy families and people how really\
  \ take care of jeopardized animals. In the very end of my journey I hung out with\
  \ some friend and we stopped to have lunch, the park as full of people that day,\
  \ was high season in July, many people from many countries, we sit in a place and\
  \ we took turns to buy our lunchs, in my turns I bought one pack with fish chips,\
  \ soda and hamburger, when I came bag to my place with my friends I remembered that\
  \ I forgot the ketchup and mayonese, I was bag to the balcony in order to request\
  \ the sauces, in canada in very commom big brrds flying and trying to find food,\
  \ while I was out, one bird took my bread, and magically when I came back there\
  \ was a simpatic and gentle guy who was worried about me, he just went in the balcony\
  \ and explained the situation to the attendant's restaurant , he gave me the bread,\
  \ said thank you to me and also mentioned that I was very welcome in his country,\
  \ I had a positive feeling about the way of life in Canada, I had since this day\
  \ in my heart that positiveness and noble actions can really change the world and\
  \ people is fundamental is this process and it conected with canada for life."
