Text: "I arrived in Axum, a small northern Ethiopian town late the previous night\
  \ and desperately want a break from my aimless, sleep deprived wandering.  As I\
  \ walk past yet another coffee shop, a woman shouts for me to join her.  I ask how\
  \ much as I take a seat, knowing I am too tired to care about being ripped off.\
  \  A small girl brings a plate of slightly stale popcorn, which I mindlessly eat\
  \ while watching the ceremony involved in making the perfect cup, starting with\
  \ roasting the beans over an open fire.  \n\nA woman running towards us brings me\
  \ out of my daze as I register her shouting in English.  Clearly unaccustomed to\
  \ running, she catches her breath while explaining the host called asking her to\
  \ translate, as I was not at a coffee shop but an invited guest into their home.\
  \  I look up at the coffee set which was so lavish I could only have assumed it\
  \ was a place of business.  I felt more humbled, watching her grind the beans with\
  \ a mortar and pestle while incense swirled above her head.  \n\nThe aroma of the\
  \ coffee precedes the first cup, once served, I drink the strong black liquid and\
  \ reflect on my coffee experiences over day.  They had certainly been shops, I assume,\
  \ although I had only been asked to pay at one of the two.  I was starting to learn\
  \ the coffee traditions specific to this region, you drink not one espresso sized\
  \ cup of coffee, but three.   You never completely finish the third cup; although\
  \ this last point was learned later.  Sugar may be offered but cream was not served.\
  \  Popcorn is brought out, as you sit on a stool, a crate or a step all covered\
  \ in loose grass.  I was so enamored with this tradition of coffee, how it seems\
  \ to be an experience you share, just as these women had chosen me to share their\
  \ coffee, and to share their afternoon.  I only hoped I would soon learn how to\
  \ delicately hold the handless porcelain bowl without burning my fingers.  \n\n\
  My translator sips from her own cup as she starts to share, explaining on this particular\
  \ day it was the feast of neighbors.  Not for the first time sitting there, I had\
  \ to reevaluate the days interactions.  Earlier I had been invited by a family butchering\
  \ a goat on the sidewalk to not only take pictures but to come back for dinner.\
  \  Genuinely interested I asked what time dinner was, and it wouldn\u2019t be until\
  \ a week later that I realized 11:00 Ethiopian time was 6:00 by the western clock.\
  \  I wrote it off as a cultural misunderstanding, but wished I had recognized the\
  \ error earlier.  It also explained the older woman who had shared a bowl of broth\
  \ with lentils as I passed.  I had assumed, wrongly, they were intending to reach\
  \ out to the poor and took the opportunity to offer me food as a bit of fun.  \n\
  \nI am served a second cup and the hospitality of this village comes together for\
  \ me and I want to contribute in my own way.  Like magic, I produce a pound of home\
  \ roasted peanuts my sweet neighbor in Uganda insisted on packing for my trip. \
  \ If Ethiopia is rich in coffee, Uganda has the soil perfect for ground nuts and\
  \ I could think of no better occasion to share them.  The women giggle as they discuss\
  \ who likes the slightly bitter flavor and who found them too dry and earthy.  \
  \  \n\nWith the final sips of my third cup of coffee, I think about how far I had\
  \ come in those first hours in Ethiopia.  I had accepted an invitation, as such\
  \ readjusted my perception of my situation.  I had been included in not just a tradition\
  \ but a local custom.  I had taken but I had also shared.  I was alone but I was\
  \ invited into the community.  All of these moments reaffirmed my belief that travel\
  \ allows for special connections.   With that I stand up, profusely thank my hosts\
  \ and I continue down the street to find what other sights and stories are waiting\
  \ for me."
