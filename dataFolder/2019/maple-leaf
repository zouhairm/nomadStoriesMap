Text: "A year and half ago I took the decision to come to Canada to improve my English\
  \ skills. Actually I didn't know anything about the culture of the country I just\
  \ though it would be as the U.S: American culture relations with British culture.\
  \ \nI arrive in Toronto the last October and my story began... at the beginning\
  \ everything was the typical American district (like every movies I have seen) but\
  \ nothing interesting for me... but everything changed when I started the school,\
  \ meeting people from all around the world and discovering the city and also the\
  \ real culture hidden all those people.\nAfter 5 months I have discovered that Canada,\
  \ specially Toronto, is the best example of what a multicultural city is. There\
  \ are people from Japan, South Korea, India, Thailand, South America, Europe...\
  \ and everybody is living together without any problems. It's wonderful. I came\
  \ here thinking I would discover a different culture but in fact j have discovered\
  \ more than 5. \nOne of the most important points of my story is the nationality\
  \ of my friends. Most of them are form Japan and South Korea but actually they are\
  \ from more than 10 different places in the world so it's very awesome when we decide\
  \ which culture we are going to discover during the weekend explaining each other\
  \ the characteristics of our culture. So as we say \"Now I don't need to go to your\
  \ country because we already know everything thank to you\" or maybe we are already\
  \ planning going to visit each other to our countries in the future. And also I\
  \ have been going by myself to circle discussions with old people meeting holocaust\
  \ survivors being my best experience in my life I can't explain how I felt when\
  \ those people explained to me those memories that I have studied affected to these\
  \ people that I had in front of me... \nOther thing that I really love of Toronto\
  \ is how people talk to you. I have had so many interesting conversations in the\
  \ subway with foreign people in English and also in Spanish king about why we are\
  \ living in Toronto, about cultures, religion, experiences... people are very open\
  \ mind and this is something that I really like it.\nI have visited 16 countries\
  \ meeting people everywhere and Canada is in my top one definetly for the people,\
  \ the multicultural and respectful society and for all the love given to me."
