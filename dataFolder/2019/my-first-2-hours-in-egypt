Text: "Everything started at the Milan airport. I got scared it was a maximum of 10%\
  \ of women on the flight heading to Cairo. Most of them had their heads covered\
  \ and were probably Islamic. Me and 3 others seemed to be fresh in that world. At\
  \ that moment, I was definitely sure I was flying to a man\u2019s rules Land.\n\
  What have I done?\nWhen I told my friends I would travel to Egypt, one month before,\
  \ they started making a big deal of it. Everyone told me I should not travel alone\
  \ there as a woman. It could be dangerous. It was not the correct time. Unfortunately,\
  \ those bits of advice just gave more courage - or defied me, as I am a person who\
  \ loves challenges.\nComing back to my flight, I noticed how tolerant I would need\
  \ to be with things I did not agree or was not used to face it. I would also need\
  \ to be patient to depend on the man to do things for me. Luckily I am one of those\
  \ very flexible and adaptive people.\nAn Egyptian descendent man, very polite, who\
  \ was sat by my side, somehow read my thoughts and started telling me the good points\
  \ about his country. \u201CPeople and the Media increase facts, especially the bad\
  \ ones. People are just normal people there\u201D\u200A\u2014\u200Ahe said. We had\
  \ a good conversation and he made me calmer and confident about the trip again.\n\
  We arrived at Cairo airport at 4 am. It is definitely a bad idea to arrive in a\
  \ city during the dawn, especially when the driver that was supposed to pick you\
  \ up at the airport does not show off. I had booked a hotel with pick up service\
  \ included, but I got a message from the concierge with the following guideline:\
  \ \"Please we advise you to take any cab in front of the airport, by the expenses\
  \ of this hotel\". \nThat was a big inconvenience! \nI had exactly booked this service\
  \ not to have to deal with \u201Cshould I trust this taxi driver or not?\u201D question\
  \ in my head. And I was exactly through the situation I did not want to be in. \n\
  I did not want to enter an unknown car with an unknown person to take me to an unknown\
  \ place. So I waited for the man I met on the airplane. He had offered any help\
  \ if I would need, and yes, he could give me the best advice. Maybe the fact he\
  \ was local and speaks Arabic could help me in finding a trustable driver.\nI do\
  \ not want to add any prejudice or misconception here, but I believe the fact he\
  \ was living and working in the United Kingdom the last years flourished on him\
  \ great gentleman attitudes. He promptly reached the hotel by phone to ask about\
  \ the requested driver.\nUnfortunately, that was the way they handle \"late\" flights.\
  \ There was not a specific hotel driver. Simple as that. The man offered himself\
  \ to drive me to the hotel then.\nIn my head, the situation did not change a lot.\
  \ He was also an unknown, a 2h flight buddy.\nCould I trust or not?\nI had a third\
  \ option: to wait more three hours at the airport and take a taxi during daylight.\
  \ \nWould it really make it safer? How tired was I to arrive at the hotel as soon\
  \ as possible?\nThe simplest way was to listen to my heart and decide.\nI took a\
  \ deep breath. And chose to take the ride he offered me.\nThe streets in Cairo were\
  \ entirely empty during the dawn. The unique lights on were from many \u201Cmen\u201D\
  \ clubs, in which belly dancers became the queen of night. When we crossed to Giza\
  \ city and I saw the Pyramids from distance in the darkness, I felt again how important\
  \ to me was to be at that magical place. I should not fear the unknown, I was in\
  \ the most mysterious place on Earth anyway.\nEverything went out fine and I arrived\
  \ at the hotel still before sunrise. I would have some hours to recharge batteries\
  \ for the next day adventures."
