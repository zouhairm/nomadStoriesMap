Text: "I had never met anyone who didn\u2019t use a clock to tell the time.\n\nThe\
  \ Masai do not need the confines of ticking hours to drive their lives. Instead,\
  \ their ancient culture remains frozen in time, preserved for the generations of\
  \ the future.\n\nThis unique tribe lives symbiotically with the African landscape.\
  \ Despite Western education, civilization and cultural influences, they have clung\
  \ to their traditional way of life, making them a symbol of Tanzanian culture.\n\
  \nAs my family and I were travelling towards the Ngorongoro Crater, we were struck\
  \ by curiosity at their provisional huts and colourful clothing. Sheepishly, we\
  \ dropped in unannounced and were greeted with open arms. The Masai family welcomed\
  \ us in song. The women on one side, and the men on the other, all seemingly singing\
  \ completely different tunes. As they sang in clashing harmony, they took turns\
  \ jumping high in the air. We later found out that this was a competition within\
  \ members of the tribe. \n\nAfterwards, the village Chief came forward and introduced\
  \ himself. He was young and handsome, and bore a pattern on both cheeks. The shape\
  \ was of a swirl, burned in place to ward off mosquitoes and disease. He looked\
  \ exotic and traditional. When he spoke in unwavering English however, he had clearly\
  \ been influenced by the Western world. I was instantly drawn to him; I wanted to\
  \ know him. \n\nWhen he spoke, it was as if he was talking directly to me.\n\n\u201C\
  Welcome to my Family. Allow me to share with you our life.\u201D \n\nSmiling slightly,\
  \ he gestured for us to follow him, and then led us along a dusty path. Soon he\
  \ stopped in front of a stick-and-mud hut, which he explained housed up to seven\
  \ people. The hut was dark and smoky inside. I quickly stepped back, understanding\
  \ immediately why the villagers preferred to be outside.\n\nAs I watched my family\
  \ go in the hut, I felt a warm hand clutch my arm. \n\n\u201CWill you allow me to\
  \ show you something different?\u201D The Chief\u2019s face was riddled with hesitation.\
  \ I nodded. \n\nAs we walked along another rough trail, passing cattle and hens,\
  \ he talked about why he left his village, and why he returned. I wanted to trust\
  \ this man beside me, but I wondered why he hadn\u2019t invited the rest of my family.\
  \  \n\nAs we neared a large hut, I could hear the pure sound of children\u2019s\
  \ voices. My nerves settled and I couldn\u2019t help grinning. The room was filled\
  \ with bright young faces, diligently chanting their alphabet. Upon seeing my stunned\
  \ face, the children jumped from their wooden seats and gathered around me, touching\
  \ my hands in genuine excitement. The room was filled with accented versions of\
  \ \u201Chello,\u201D \u201Challo,\u201D \u201Chow are you?\u201D as they chimed\
  \ their memorized English. The Chief motioned for me to sit with the children and\
  \ watch as the lesson unfolded.   \n\nThe Chief whispered: \u201CThis school only\
  \ caters for children up to six years old.\u201D I nodded, interested.  \n\nHe continued:\
  \ \u201CAfter this, the children must make the dangerous and long journey from our\
  \ village to the nearest school. This is sometimes a two-hour walk.\u201D \n\n\u201C\
  Why is it dangerous?\u201D I naively questioned. \n\n\u201CThe threats of wild animals\
  \ and malicious people within the parks.\u201D He stopped, drawing in a short breath.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWe are met with a choice,\u201D he went on slowly. \u201CForsake our\
  \ education to learn traditional farming methods, or...\u201D And he paused, weighing\
  \ his words. \u201CAbandon our culture and home to live at a western school. Just\
  \ as I did.\u201D \n\nIt was a difficult situation - this became clear as he spoke.\
  \ Missionaries with makeshift schools had been sent to educate his people, but was\
  \ the cost of the \u201Cfree\u201D education the indoctrination of religion? \n\n\
  The Masai were not interested in Christianity or in any Western values. Their hearts\
  \ and minds were with their family and land. They didn\u2019t want to change. And\
  \ why should they?\n\nLeaving the village, where we stayed too long, I realised\
  \ that I would always remember the time I met the Masai. Like them, I didn\u2019\
  t need a clock."
