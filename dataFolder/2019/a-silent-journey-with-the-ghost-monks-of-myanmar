Text: "With hands behind my back, I walked alone through the jungle in the dark hours\
  \ of the pre-dawn morning. I habitually took great care to keep my footfall methodically\
  \ quiet. Two weeks inside, and I was already well-conditioned by my circumstances.\
  \ A scorpion the size of my fist emerged in the spotlight of my headlamp, hobbling\
  \ languorous but persistently across my path. I paused to let it pass with a mingled\
  \ sense of awe and comradeship.\n\nBy the time I reached the Panditarama temple\
  \ from my forest hut, most of the others had arrived. Some were from Myanmar, here\
  \ fulfilling their duty as Buddhists, while others, like myself, had made pilgrimages\
  \ from all over the world in order to live like a strict monk for as long we wished\
  \ or could bear. Some sat beneath their dangling mosquito nets, their shoulders\
  \ hunched with the burden of lost sleep, while others lifted their feet inch by\
  \ inch into the air like a water dance, their soles softly landing on the wooden\
  \ floor to complete a single step. To the outside world, they must appear like mindless\
  \ zombies. They did to me, too. I soon learned that nothing could be further from\
  \ the truth. For this was in fact a form of moving meditation known simply as \"\
  walking meditation.\" With great concentration, we are meant to bring our awareness\
  \ to the subtlest sensations of our body\u2013in this case, the feelings of our\
  \ feet upon the floor, through the air, the contortions of our muscles, and our\
  \ very breath. \n\nI decided to join the patient walking procession. I chose a pathway\
  \ near one of the few fans, for even in these early morning hours the tropical heat\
  \ was beginning to yawn awake. By the afternoon, I would be drenched in my own sweat.\
  \ I spent the next uncounted minutes doing my best to remain present in my body\
  \ and the moment, yet unavoidably straying into distracted thoughts. Many hours\
  \ of this practice had conditioned me to notice how the grains of dust rolled and\
  \ jabbed at my sole. The gong rang. \n\nThe monks entered silently like hooded ghosts\
  \ as the rest of us quietly moved to our cushions, taking care that our mosquito\
  \ nets covered us well. My body felt the now familiar stiffness and aches that would\
  \ ebb and flow throughout the day. They were unbearable at first, but with time\
  \ my body adapted. Despite the pains we would, for the next hour, and all subsequent\
  \ hours of sitting practice, do our best to remain perfectly still and follow the\
  \ movements of our breath in order to \"tame our wild minds.\" For nearly fourteen\
  \ hours, we would interchange between sitting and walking meditations in the pursuit\
  \ of mastering our minds, understanding our inner worlds, find peace, demons, and\
  \ theoretically progress farther down the path of \"enlightenment.\" No doubt each\
  \ person's reasons for being there were different, but I would never know. While\
  \ on meditation retreat at Panditarama Forest Meditation Center in Myanmar, outside\
  \ the Yangon capital, you cannot speak to anyone . . . ever. \n\nYes, I had not\
  \ spoken to anyone other than a few paltry minutes with my monk teacher in his hut\u2013\
  with the help of a translator\u2013for over two weeks. Besides this unbreakable\
  \ rule of complete silence, we ate only two simple meals a day, could not swing\
  \ our hands while we walked, and must keep our eyes downcast at all time. No doubt\
  \ many in the western world would imagine something akin to a prison camp, and be\
  \ baffled as to why anyone would volunteer themselves to such an experience. Yet\
  \ these rules have been cultivated and tested for hundreds if not thousands of years\
  \ in order to support monks and laypersons reach their deepest inner truths, and\
  \ hopefully obtain at least some semblance of peace. \n\nThe gong called us from\
  \ our varied states. The monks began their chants in the ancient language of Pali.\
  \ I bowed with reverence for their reverence. They concluded, and we lined up outside.\
  \ As we marched towards breakfast, step by slow step in single file, the violet\
  \ orange light of rising dawn illuminated our path."
