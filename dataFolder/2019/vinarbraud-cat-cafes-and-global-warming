Text: "Vinarbraud, Cat Cafes and Global Warming\nI rolled over to check the time.\
  \ 4.27am. The sun wouldn\u2019t be up for another 7 hours and even then, would barely\
  \ graze the scattering of treetops peaking sleepily from between rows of colourful\
  \ homes lining the narrow cobblestone streets before dipping back into an icy abyss.\n\
  Through the frosted windows of the hostel I could see a thick haze already beginning\
  \ to obscure the star-speckled night. It was now or never.\nI pushed into the darkness\
  \ and was instantly met with a frigid blast of Arctic wind. Pulling my scarf higher,\
  \ I dug my mittened hands deeper into my parka pockets and hurried into the night,\
  \ eyes focused on the sky. It was my final morning in Iceland and though my last\
  \ hopes of glimpsing the Northern Lights were diminished with each step beneath\
  \ the thickening cloud cover, I couldn\u2019t help but feel I had discovered something\
  \ even more magical than the elusive Aurora Borealis.\nIt was only my second visit\
  \ to the Land of Fire and Ice, my first having been that past spring. This time\
  \ I had come to experience Iceland at her coldest, darkest, loneliest; to try to\
  \ understand the reason for my near obsessive love of a people, language and place\
  \ I still barely knew.\nThe day before I had travelled to the South Coast. Entirely\
  \ awe-struck, I spent the day marveling at the torrents of water plummeting from\
  \ steep cliffs to sea-bound rivers below as nesting gulls swooped and soared through\
  \ the shimmering mists of Seljalandsfoss and Skogafoss waterfalls. I explored spectral\
  \ sea caves in the shadow of towering basalt columns, observing how the ebony hued\
  \ Reynisdrangar sea stacks jutting sharply from the deadly waters of Renisfjara\
  \ Beach contrasted sharply with the white foam-tipped waves as they tumbled pitch-black\
  \ pebbles to the rhythm of their very own symphony.\nAt Solheimajokull, our guide,\
  \ Boran, explained that just a few years ago the pale blue glacial toe reached as\
  \ far down as the car park. The rapidly receding ice had left in its stead an ever-deepening\
  \ lagoon flecked with shrinking ice floats. \u201CEach winter is getting warmer\
  \ and warmer, with less snow. Everything is changing. The glaciers are disappearing.\u201D\
  \ A subtle look of sadness crossed his stoic, fully bearded face as he turned and\
  \ continued to walk briskly toward the wall of ice ahead. \nCould it be this contradiction,\
  \ like Boran and the glaciers, of unfathomable strength juxtaposed with fragile\
  \ vulnerability caught in an impossible balancing act? Or the undeniable allure\
  \ of raw, unforgiving, wondrous nature herself that had me so smitten?\nAs I crunched\
  \ through the frozen atmosphere, inadvertently attracting the attention of a fluffy,\
  \ grey and white feline gazing out from her cozy window perch, I tried to put a\
  \ finger on it.\nPerhaps it was the simple comforts of my very favourite caf\xE9\
  \ in all the multi-verse, Kattakaffihusid (Iceland\u2019s only cat caf\xE9), where\
  \ I have spent countless hours cuddling purring kitties nestled into hand-stitched\
  \ cushions, sipping a piping hot soya latte to the mesmerizing cadence of native\
  \ banter as gusting rains pounded relentlessly against the polished, seemingly impenetrable\
  \ picture windows?\nAs I turned the next corner a faint yet unmistakable smell wafted\
  \ to me from up ahead. An indescribable joy filled my heart as I closed my eyes\
  \ took a deep breath.\nDespite the frigid air the bakery\u2019s door was propped\
  \ open, an enticing warm glow emanating through the windows. I entered the fragrant\
  \ oasis grinning stupidly as a large tray of rhubarb-hazelnut vinarbraud (the pinnacle\
  \ of Icelandic pastry perfection) was placed in the display window. \nI stepped\
  \ back into the cold clutching my vinarbraud still smiling gleefully as the first\
  \ flakes began to fall."
