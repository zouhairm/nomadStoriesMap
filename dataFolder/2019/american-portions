Text: "The man was well-meaning enough. He continued to stretch the leather of the\
  \ US size 8.5 sandal with a metal rod while I, a size 9, repeatedly attempted to\
  \ fit into it.\n\n\u201COk try again,\u201D he encouraged while jokingly wiping\
  \ the sweat off his brow.\n\nBy the fourth try, a couple of petite, \u2018Chanel-ified\u2019\
  \ Taiwanese women finally wandered over. I knew what was coming and braced for it\
  \ by sitting up straight and sucking it in. My gargantuan non-pedicured foot, now\
  \ on window display for many an Instagram post, comments rolling in along the lines\
  \ of, \u201CWait, is she actually Western?\u201D\n\nI\u2019m half Taiwanese and\
  \ half mainly-Dutch-but-also-Scottish-and-a-little-bit-of-Welsh. My mother used\
  \ to call herself an egg (\u201Cwhite on the outside, yellow on the inside\u201D\
  ) which made me, by default, a banana (\u201Cyellow on the outside, white on the\
  \ inside\u201D). Fraught with finding an alternative, I came up with \u201Chealthy\
  \ breakfast\u201D or \u201Cbanana cake\u201D which was pretty good for an eight-year-old\
  \ staving off an impending identity crisis. \n\nDepending on where I am in the world\
  \ I'm typically viewed as Asian or white, expected to be Asian or white, act Asian\
  \ or white, and feel Asian or white - but never both, there\u2019s no one-size-fits-all\
  \ type of situation, and rarely do I get to choose as one side usually comes out\
  \ as a subconscious (sometimes rebellious) reaction to whoever\u2019s looking.\n\
  \nConstantly wavering between two very diametrically opposed cultures, stereotypes,\
  \ and beauty standards, I never knew how to reconcile them as both dictated absolutes.\
  \ I was never enough in my achievements but too much in my waist size. I was self-conscious\
  \ about my low self-esteem and then ashamed that it wasn\u2019t higher. I was balancing\
  \ critical thinking while battling critical statements - most of which were brought\
  \ out tenfold during visits to the fatherland where my voice was too loud, my actions\
  \ were too obvious, my tone was too disrespectful, and my feet were... too big.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYour feet! Ah! I try one more time. Last time.\u201D\n\nThe once-polite\
  \ women now giggled as they gaped at my body and I wondered why I was still sitting\
  \ there, trying to (literally) fit in. Getting called fat by strangers in Taiwan\
  \ is a rite of culture shock that I had passed long ago. (I now console my Western\
  \ female friends, \u201CWe\u2019re in a weight-obsessed country where women once\
  \ measured their thinness by squeezing themselves into plastic bag onesies from\
  \ 7-11. Don\u2019t let it get to you.\u201D)\n\nI finally chose to respond, with\
  \ a balance of aggression and awkward conviction, \u201CI am normal.\u201D\n\nLater\
  \ that night I passed by a Chili's and as I stood (sandal-less) there curbside,\
  \ drooling over the buffalo chicken wings, I noticed a little sign at the bottom\
  \ of the menu: Warning: American portions."
