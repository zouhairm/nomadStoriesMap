Text: "I remember many times and for years and years listen the song of Uruguayan\
  \ Jorge Drexler, 12 segundos de oscuridad (12 seconds of darkness), but I never\
  \ realized of the song really was, besides a beautiful song. \nIn 2015 I would travel\
  \ to Uruguay, I had lodging and reserved the tickets, however I started develop\
  \ panic attacks, because of financial issues, I began to have mental health problems\
  \ and understood that this was not a good moment to be alone. I won the battle against\
  \ anxiety, after all this is a war that we fight every day. And in 2017 was the\
  \ perfect time to travel to this beautiful, so open and inspired country.\nIn my\
  \ research about Uruguay, I found Cabo Polonio, a fishermen isolated village, and\
  \ in this moment I discovered what the song was about. I was so intrigued, that\
  \ I put this picturesque place in my route, take my bag and went to there, from\
  \ Montevideo is 5 hours by bus, with a lot of stops in little towns that the name\
  \ we never heard before.\nCabo Polonio is a ecological reserve, so to get there\
  \ it is necessary buy a ticket round trip to take de Jardineira, big trucks with\
  \ seats, cars are forbidden there, only the local citizen have permission to use\
  \ it. Tickets on my hands, it\xB4s time to pick up the Jardineira a follow my way,\
  \ you pass through by the dunes and arrive in a long beautiful and empty beach.\
  \ When I arrived at the little downtown, I saw my hostel, Viejo Lobo, a rustic and\
  \ simple house, with nets for rest at the entrance and the flowerbed of Marijuana.\
  \ I took my camera and go out to explore, is the best thing to do in Cabo, walk\
  \ around, stop and see the the landscape, the sea, the lighthouse, the white houses\
  \ built at the top of the rocks or even the sea wolves in your sun bath. During\
  \ the summer there are some little stores and restaurants open with cold beers and\
  \ your bu\xF1elos de algas, algae fry balls. \nBut it\xB4s at night that made me\
  \ do part of the song, even without intention, that takes me to there, in your 12\
  \ seconds of darkness that the lighthouse allows us  to have, there is the village\
  \ without energy in your little streets with sands, with the most starring sky that\
  \ I saw in my short life, and with desire to explore the darkness, foot behind foot,\
  \ with no way to walk, just to watch the noctilucas at the sea that shine bright\
  \ like sky. \nThis is Cabo Polonio, a beautiful place, wich even write in a song,\
  \ you just understand being there, a place where the time don\xB4t pass, you enjoy\
  \ the day at extremely, and the night bring a calm and peace sound by a guitar and\
  \ bonfires and this make me realize that worth it wait to have a some peace in me\
  \ and found it in other place. A local who needs keep in the way it is, without\
  \ taking away, and I hope that your calm, beauty and particularity maintain for\
  \ centuries."
