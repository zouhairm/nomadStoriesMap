Text: "\u201CI heard my papers came today? Are you happy?\u201D. I said in a message\
  \ to my Great-Aunt. \u201CYes excited. John rang me and we talked. He said you want\
  \ to stay with me. That\u2019s very nice. Looking forward to see you\u201D. She\
  \ replied. Who would\u2019ve thought I\u2019d be returning to my hometown. A place\
  \ I took for granted when I was younger to now holding it close to my heart. It\
  \ was the summertime, a New Zealand summer season I\u2019ve only had the pleasure\
  \ of entering only twice for the two holidays we went back. It\u2019s a little hot\
  \ but it doesn\u2019t beat the sticky-hot summer air I\u2019ve felt back in Australia.\
  \ I bloody love it here as I try to take in everything. Fruit trees, roses, green\
  \ grass, beaches, nice locals, the scenery is to die for. But I guess things are\
  \ not always what they seem. As time passes I begin to adjust to the actual reality.\
  \ Fruit trees are just fruit trees, roses, eh they\u2019re just roses. You soon\
  \ become accustomed to it all. That beach isn\u2019t beautiful no more. Eh, it\u2019\
  s just a beach. Plus did you hear? That\u2019s were they murdered that man and dumped\
  \ his body right over there. And suicide, did you know we have the highest suicide\
  \ rate in the country. Our people killing themselves. Our mental health system is\
  \ a mess, better off saying we have no system. A place where the ambulance isn\u2019\
  t coming so you\u2019re better off calling the cops, they\u2019ll surely get to\
  \ you in no time. A place where babies are raising babies, domestic violence raging,\
  \ gangs showing muscle. My beautiful hometown, what\u2019s going on inside of you\
  \ my dear? The other day we went for a evening walk and saw many homeless people\
  \ just laying about. Youths and the elderly. Two old men drowning their sorrows\
  \ along the river. The kids at my school only ever want to get drunk or high. Where\
  \ am I? I\u2019ve never experienced this in my life. Where I grew up people were\
  \ well-off. We\u2019re a bunch of selfish bastards I thought to myself. Being in\
  \ this place has taught me a lot. Things ain\u2019t always what they seem to be.\
  \ I\u2019ll never complain again. I have a roof over my head, food, cloths, an education\
  \ and someone who love and cares about me."
