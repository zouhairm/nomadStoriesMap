Text: "It was dark outside the cab, passing by many streets the darkness was still\
  \ there, almost staring me.\n\nHowever, my feeling was excitement, exploring a new\
  \ country and seeing their culture. But also had fear because that country was utterly\
  \ strange for me. \n\nAlthough the things looked auspicious when after crossing\
  \ the border in Ciudad del Este, I got astonished with all those neon lights comparable\
  \ to Times Square. On my way through Paraguay, natives informed me in Spanish about\
  \ their substantial average salaries of almost 500 dollars a month, bigger than\
  \ in Brazil.\n\nThe cab left me at a great 5 star hotel that cost 150 reais (circa\
  \ 50 dollars) per day, a good deal if compared to same standard hotels in Brazil!\
  \ \nEverything there looked fancy, the room was very comfortable and its location\
  \ extremely good, only a few steps walking from Calle Palma, the Asunci\xF3n's heart.\n\
  \nMy bag got accommodated inside and feeling a little tired after travelling for\
  \ 25 hours by bus, I just dinned a delicious Surubi soup (Pantanal fish soup) and\
  \ went to bed.\n\nOn the following day I walked Calle Palma, a busy street full\
  \ of stores and restaurants during the day, but also with an incredible nightlife.\
  \ It sounded noisy as S\xE3o Paulo and have a mixing of poverty with wealthy. But\
  \ something was different.\n\nWhile walking by Calle Palma, a group of Paraguayans\
  \ suggested me to visit the railway museum (Museo del Ferrocarril) and the independence\
  \ house (Casa de Independencia - where they explain about Paraguay bloody past).\n\
  \nLater I encountered two students from a local university guiding their Chilean\
  \ and Mexican friends; I joined their group and visited where they study, an old\
  \ downtown building constructed by Mariscal Lopez, a 19th Century president. They\
  \ told us that Asunci\xF3n downtown area concentrates a large number of universities.\
  \ Also, we visited Cabildo, their old Congress building where you can see nowadays\
  \ more about Paraguay's history, culture and art.\n\nParaguay is different as I\
  \ said, they have a fraternal spirit, maybe made by the 19th Century wars that transformed\
  \ them into a mixed melting pot of Asians, Europeans, \"mestizos\" and indigenous\
  \ \"Guaran\xEDs\", people who fled to that impoverished but open community, intending\
  \ to rebuild their lives in South America with few indigenous and \"mestizos\" survivors.\n\
  \nWhile going by bus to Aviadores del Chaco Avenue, I met a local lawyer and he\
  \ suddenly started to talk, telling me his passion for Brazil. If you visit someday\
  \ Asunci\xF3n, the mentioned avenue is a fancy shopping area where you must go.\n\
  \nHowever, they don't have railways anymore and neither subway system or Uber app.\
  \ So, you are going to take lots of buses. Because cabs are for rich travellers.\n\
  \nParaguayans can be different due to their commercial spirit too. And visiting\
  \ their stores, I saw many products and brands from overseas that I've never seen\
  \ in Brazil, making me feel like a Cuban arriving in Miami, electronics and even\
  \ dollars are cheaper if compared to Brazilian prices. \n\nUnforgettable is walking\
  \ Costanera Avenue during Sunday afternoon, there you can divide a cup of terere\
  \ with your friends following Paraguay's friendship tradition. It proved more how\
  \ fraternal they are and why travel.state.gov considers Paraguay one of the safest\
  \ South American countries.\n\nAlthough Paraguay remains poor. So, you are going\
  \ to see many children asking for money and that will break your heart.\n \nBy the\
  \ end when I departed back to S\xE3o Paulo, Asunci\xF3n streets were more enlightened,\
  \ despite being a night equal as when I arrived. Perhaps my fear absence could explain\
  \ it. \n\nParaguay is a lovely and unforgettable country that worth visiting as\
  \ much as you can!"
