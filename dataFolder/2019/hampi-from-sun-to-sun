Text: "It is four in the morning when we listen \u201CWake up and get off!\u201D,\
  \ two hours before the scheduled time of arrival to Hampi. We can\xB4t find anyone\
  \ in the bus who speaks enough English to explain to us what is going on. In India,\
  \ there are so many illogical events per day that this doesn\xB4t surprise us. But\
  \ we are alarmed and refuse to leave the bus until they get us another vehicle to\
  \ switch to.\nThe new vehicle is almost full. We are four and there are not enough\
  \ empty spaces. But as soon as she sees us, a lady moves aside, leaves her legs\
  \ hanging and invites us to sit down, to share her bed.\nOne thing I love about\
  \ travelling it's making friends. And I not necessarily mean lasting friends. But\
  \ those who can last minutes, hours or a day. Those who ask you where you come from,\
  \ invite you to share the sidewalk with them and tell you a bit about their life.\
  \ Stories that help you build a puzzle about the place you are visiting, its traditions,\
  \ its people. Maybe we exchange Whatsapp numbers or a selfie. Maybe not. But their\
  \ words can engraved forever in us.\nI am sure that if you are open to questions\
  \ if you look into people\xB4s eyes and give or return smiles; if you are not worried\
  \ about the pass of time, it is almost impossible that this will not happen to you,\
  \ in any part of the world.\nResponding to the invitations of  \"come come!\" (the\
  \ particular Indian way and of some Southeast Asian countries to call someone) and\
  \ chatting with the people of Happy Hampi, we understood why it carries that nickname\
  \ and how many things there are to learn from each other. \nAfter a long day through\
  \ rice fields, endless palm trees plantations and reddish rocks, the sun finally\
  \ set and we wander without concrete destination through the small streets of the\
  \ town. Only some tuk-tuk passes every now and then. No cars. Every door is open,\
  \ there seems to be no fear in this place. Or maybe it\xB4s the only way to deal\
  \ with the dense heat.\nWhen looking inside one of these doors, something catches\
  \ our attention: a room full of children sitting on the floor, in a messy circle.\
  \ A man with a dark moustache stands out, sitting on a chair in the middle of them.\
  \ We just peeked with intrigue, till the \"come come\" of the teacher made us venture\
  \ with our whole body and being.\nIt's late to be at school, we think. But it is\
  \ a tutoring session, they clarify us. \"Sit down, please\", asks the man. Without\
  \ thinking, we do it and the little ones revolutionize around us.\nThey get so curious.\
  \ Each of us is surrounded by two or three of them and is observed by a few more\
  \ eyes.\nI am with Anushka and Ganesh, aged seven and eight. Their English is impeccable\
  \ and their ability to express themselves leaves me in awe. Quickly, their names\
  \ are recorded in my hand with their pens. That need to be remembered, to transcend,\
  \ is something that I don\xB4t stop seeing in this country, especially in children.\
  \ \nI lost track of how much time we spend, them showing me their notebooks, tasks\
  \ and designs. They describe in detail their favourite games and even explain to\
  \ me how to attract a monkey to my shoulder if another person holds a banana nearby.\
  \ \nThey also describe how much it hurts when a teacher gets angry. I suddenly feel\
  \ guilty. If they do not get to fulfil their daily tasks because of talking with\
  \ us, it is likely that they get punished once we're gone. Are we generating more\
  \ harm than good? Is my inevitable question. \nWhen we are about to leave, the teacher\
  \ tells us that they need pens and notebooks. Someone sells them in the corner.\
  \ At least, this is something useful we can contribute. After we get the materials,\
  \ we say goodbye with a hectic and blurred group photo. Enough to remember those\
  \ minutes -or hours- of joy for the rest of our lives."
