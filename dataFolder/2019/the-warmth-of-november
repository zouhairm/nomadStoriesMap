Text: "When I woke up that day I had so many exquisite feelings, I decided break my\
  \ routine and revive my days with more passion and freedom, I wanted to discover\
  \ new horizons , customs and traditions, and to taste new food and see brand new\
  \ places I had never been before.\n\nI made this decision motivated by the love\
  \ of adventure, which was a huge part of my personality, but tough circumstances\
  \ made me put all my dreams and ambitions behind me for a certain period of time\
  \ in order to focus on my studies and my future.\n\nI went to the aviation office\
  \ without thinking twice about it, I booked my ticket in November to Tunisia, our\
  \ neighbor country, which despite its presence near to our side geographically but\
  \ there are many beautiful differences between us, I haven't consulted any of my\
  \ family or friends and I did not want anyone to go there with me, I wanted to enjoy\
  \ the experience myself, with its' bitter and sweet days, and to see the magnificence\
  \ of what is said about this wonderful coastal country.\n\nEveryone was surprised\
  \ by my decision. Tunisia is very cold in November and there is not a lot of tourists\
  \ at this time of year, unlike the summer, But I decided to listen to myself this\
  \ time and go through the experiment.\n\nThe plane arrived at night in Tunis, and\
  \ I was worried that I won't find a place to sleep or I couldn't find a taxi driver,\
  \ Plus I didn't knew the city very well.\nI was generally nervous and had a feeling\
  \ of alienation, but luckily I found a quiet place to stay in and decided to start\
  \ my journey from the morning.\n\nThe morning began with great activity in the capital,\
  \ I woke up to the sounds of Antique French car sellers and the smell of cakes and\
  \ baked goods, The scent of jasmine was also in the air, and I came down to the\
  \ old shops, caf\xE9s and old white houses with their blue domes and wonderful doors\
  \ for authentic Tunisian breakfast. \n\nThen I decided to go to St. Paul's Church,\
  \ which is one of the oldest churches in North Africa and adorns the city center,\
  \ The sky was cloudy at that time and the rain began to fall. Despite that I was\
  \ busy feeding birds in Bourguiba Square and reading old books in the neighborhoods'\
  \ libraries\nIn the middle of all this water!.\n\nI was eager to eat delicious Tunisian\
  \ food at lunch, and of course the couscous is the master of their table, In addition\
  \ to fish, red meat, vegetables and grains, the Tunisians were very generous in\
  \ their food and impression. They always greet you and wish you health and wellness\
  \ even if they did not know you.\n\nThe happiest time I spent in Tunisia was in\
  \ Sidi Bousaid, a very beautiful maritime area. It is very similar to the Greek\
  \ islands in terms of houses and streets and overlooks the city's corniche and is\
  \ home to fish and seafood restaurants.\n\nAfter that I went to the National Museum\
  \ of Bardo, which is full of antiques from various civilizations on Tunisian lands,\
  \ and offered flowers in solidarity with the tourists who died in the terrorist\
  \ attack in 2015.\n\nAt the end, I can not shorten my trip to green Tunisia in 700\
  \ words. It meant a lot to me. It was the beginning of my dependence on myself.\
  \ I came back from there carrying gifts, souvenirs and knowledge, And the more I\
  \ remember the journey home, the more I felt nostalgic for that country again.\n\
  \nI am looking forward for being a part of this program in order to achieve my dreams\
  \ in being a professional writer and traveler for all countries in the world bearing\
  \ the principles of human brotherhood, equality and freedom."
