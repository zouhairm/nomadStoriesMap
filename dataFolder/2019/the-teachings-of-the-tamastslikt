Text: "Driving into Pendleton, I experience the town\u2019s catch phrase \u201Cthe\
  \ Real West\u201D coming more to life with every mile, leaving my city behind and\
  \ entering what appears to be a rundown ghost town. Dotted with tumbleweeds, a single\
  \ winding road and the occasional windmill, the town pleasantly surprised me with\
  \ an oasis rich of culture. The Tam\xE1stslikt Cultural Institute preserves the\
  \ history, traditions and teachings of the Umatilla Indian Tribe, telling their\
  \ story of the Oregon Trail.  I was shown a different way of life, one not too far\
  \ in the past. I was told of the untold story and wisdom of the Nat\xEDtayt, The\
  \ People, and learned of both their heartbreak and resilience. \nThe Nat\xEDtayt\
  \ had a close bond with the world, their resources and all the tribes. The people\
  \ were diverse but their common bond was their unified world view and the abundant\
  \ natural resources they shared. To be at peace with themselves and the world was\
  \ their way of life. The coyote is used as a staple figure in their teachings. Known\
  \ as Ispily\xE1y, the coyote is a teacher and guide yet also the foolish one and\
  \ the trickster, representing the many facets of the human condition. \nMy guide\
  \ showed me the rivers where they fished, the artwork with beads and feathers that\
  \ expressed through their creativity the beauty of life and the homes they built\
  \ that were made to move with the seasons. \nWith the introduction of horses, the\
  \ tribe was free to roam. But with horses also came the people from the East, the\
  \ whites who took their freedom and deinstitutionalized their culture. The woman\u2019\
  s eyes bore the sadness that she and her people endured, telling me how her children\
  \ were taken away to boarding schools, taught new languages and religions, and sold\
  \ to new families for \u2018a better way of life\u2019. The ones that returned are\
  \ the ones who fought for their people\u2019s rights to freedom and citizenship\
  \ and proudly carry on the legacy today.\n\u201CWe are adaptive to the force of\
  \ change.\u201D Said my guide. \u201CWe were. We are. We will be.\u201D\nA beautiful\
  \ testimony to the human spirit, where hope and strength rises up out of the anguish."
