Text: "The ancient Namib desert on a breathless December morning. We had set out early\
  \ with our guide in the loud stillness to spot a few of the desert's tiny creatures.\
  \ We made our way past the haunting horse graveyard, skulls punctuated with single\
  \ bullet holes to ward off disease in the early 1900s. Sweaty and caffeine-fuelled,\
  \ we were on the hunt for lizards, chameleons and the elusive Namibian sidewinder\
  \ snake. \n\nJapanese tourists giggling, Land Rover rattling and knee sweat trickling,\
  \ our somewhat eccentric (and barefoot) local guide slammed on the brakes. Running\
  \ around a small sand dune, she barked at us to stay back. Suddenly freezing, she\
  \ hissed: \u201CBloody hell - I almost stepped on a sidewinder! But don\u2019t worry\
  \ \u2013 they aren\u2019t deadly. I was bitten by one last year and it\u2019ll take\
  \ my eyesight a few years to recover but it\u2019s okay I promise. If he jumps out,\
  \ I\u2019ll catch him in my hat. I want you to move very slowly towards me and I\u2019\
  ll show you.\u201D Hapless tourists gazed nervously at each other as our Machiavellian\
  \ instincts kicked in \u201CNo I insist \u2013 after you!\u201D In deathly silent\
  \ single file, we moved towards the back of the dune where our guide had crouched\
  \ down on her knees in front of a faint pattern on the surface of the sand. \n\n\
  As instructed, we gathered a few steps back in a small circle around her. \u201C\
  Now everyone, snakes can sense energy. I want you to all relax and to only emit\
  \ good energy else he\u2019ll jump out and we don\u2019t want that to happen. If\
  \ we don\u2019t move too much and if we don\u2019t feel any fear, he\u2019ll think\
  \ that we haven\u2019t seen him. Now watch me very carefully.\u201D \n\nOur eyes\
  \ widened as the guide placed her face a few inches away from the pattern in the\
  \ sand and gently began to blow. Her breath slowly displaced the tiny diamond-like\
  \ particles covering the snake\u2019s face. We gasped in delight as a pair of coppery\
  \ yellow eyes appeared out of nowhere. Eyes which, like the stars, had gazed out\
  \ onto the desert for thousands of years, all-knowing. Beautiful and alien, the\
  \ snake\u2019s body was now exposed for us to see. He gazed at us, wild and unblinking,\
  \ before slowly retreating into the scorched landscape which had birthed him."
