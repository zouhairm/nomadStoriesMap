Text: "As a city dweller, my natural habitat is in local coffee shops and malls. Though\
  \ Dublin has its fair share of modern malls and tourist sites, I always found myself\
  \ in random nooks and crannies, trying local foods like blood pudding and engaging\
  \ in locals talking about sports and \u201Cdreadful\u201D weather. \n\nMy time in\
  \ Dublin happened to fall on the hurling match finals when Galway and Limerick faced\
  \ off in Croke Park. This was definitely a controversial pairing, with a rivalry\
  \ seeded in the early 1900s. \n\nI went to O\u2019Neills with a fellow backpacker\
  \ I met on a walking tour earlier in the day: Kimberly was a Southern belle who\
  \ had just graduated from TexasU a few months ago. We sat with pints of Guinness\
  \ in one hand, and Smoked Irish salmon bagels in the other hand, trying to figure\
  \ out the game. Despite being the only Chinese and American women at the bar, we\
  \ felt completely comfortable. I chose to sit close to the bar so that we could\
  \ be engulfed in the excitement surrounding us. I can get used to this, I thought\
  \ to myself, pretending to understand the game. This is just like Super Bowl Sunday.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWho ya rootin\u2019 fer?\u201D the toothy bartender smiled. \n\n\u201C\
  Whoever you are,\u201D I laughed. \u201CLimerick?\u201D\n\n\u201CGood on ya,\u201D\
  \ bartender winked, handing me a cheeky shot of Jameson. \u201CNext one\u2019s on\
  \ me too, if yer right about this.\u201D\n\nSo, Limerick won so both Kimberly and\
  \ I got another shot of Jameson. \n\nCarnage erupted after the game ended. Limerick\
  \ fans at one end of the bar were cheering at the screen, throwing their drinks,\
  \ and hugging everyone around them; whilst at the other end, angry Galway fans were\
  \ huffing and puffing loudly. It felt like home, how these sports fans were so heavily\
  \ invested in the outcome of the game.  \n\nThere was a healthy amount of trash-talking\
  \ and post-game commentary that people engaged in at the loud bar, but nothing compared\
  \ to the old fella that jumped onto the bar and started singing the Irish national\
  \ anthem. In a heartbeat, the rest of the bar joined in. I took this as a cue to\
  \ make my exit. \n\nI thanked the bartender for the shots and left with Kimberly.\
  \ On our way out, two young Irishmen smoking cigarettes outside waved us down.\n\
  \n\u201C\u2019Aye!\u201D one of them shouted at us. \u201CWho won?\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  Limerick did,\u201D Kimberly took the lead, totally unphased.\n\n\u201CAhh, that\
  \ sounds aber\u2019t right,\u201D they looked at each other and inhaled. \u201C\
  Wher\u2019 ya from?\u201D\n\nI loved the way that Irishmen spoke: the singsong-friendly\
  \ way they annunciated in Dublin; like the curves and ridges of soft hills. I felt\
  \ instantly comfortable talking to these men.  \n\n\u201CLondon,\u201D I said without\
  \ thinking.\n\n\u201CYa\u2019 don\u2019t say?\u201D he said. \u201CI woz thur\u2019\
  \ a few weeks ago.\u201D\n\n\u201CI live in the Canadian London,\u201D I laughed.\
  \ \u201CSorry to disappoint.\u201D\n\n \u201CI didn\u2019t even know thur\u2019\
  \ wuz a Can-eh-dian one,\u201D they chucked. \u201CAnd yer\u2019self?\u201D they\
  \ looked at Kimberly.\n\n\u201CTexas,\u201D she smiled innocently. \u201CHow are\
  \ ya\u2019ll?\u201D\n\nAfter a brief exchange, Kimberly and I bid the two men adieu.\
  \ In a half drunken haze, we tried to navigate through the alleyways and copious\
  \ number of bridges back to our hostel. Everything seemed funnier after the pints\
  \ of Guinness and Jameson shots that were gifted to us at the bar for just being\
  \ fun and foreign. \n\nIt was definitely better than Super Bowl Sunday."
