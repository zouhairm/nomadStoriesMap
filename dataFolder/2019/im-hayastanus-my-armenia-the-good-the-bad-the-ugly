Text: "In 2015, the Kardashians premiered their \u201Clife-changing journey\u201D\
  \ to Armenia. Like the Kardashians, I, too, am Armenian-American. Also, I, too,\
  \ visited Armenia that same year. I, too, visited Geghard Monastery, Gyumri, and\
  \ Tsitsernakaberd (Armenian genocide memorial). I, too, ate mouth-watering Armenian\
  \ desserts and visited my ancestors\u2019 homes. I, too, explored the night life\
  \ of Yerevan and did all the touristy activities. However, unlike the Kardashians,\
  \ I was also exposed to the poverty and corruption of this former Soviet nation.\n\
  I stayed in Armenia for two months- in the industrialized capital of Yerevan and,\
  \ also, the poverty-stricken farms of the country side. I travelled throughout the\
  \ country and saw past the glamor of Baghramyan Street. I met elderly taxi drivers\
  \ trying to win green cards, broke college students trying to get study visas, Armenian-Syrian\
  \ refugees struggling for acceptance, and desperate families trying to emigrate\
  \ out of the country. In my father\u2019s hometown of Vanadzor, the third biggest\
  \ city in the country, once booming with life, now was overpacked with stray dogs.\
  \ Decrepit Soviet factories cover the country, a bittersweet reminder of guaranteed\
  \ employment under Communist rule. Although tourism and awareness of Armenia has\
  \ increased tremendously this past decade, the country has become a playground for\
  \ the wealthy. This Christian nation once known for its ancient churches has succumbed\
  \ to the sins of underground sex clubs, shady strip clubs, and underage bars. Jobs\
  \ and wages have diminished as prices continue to strike higher and higher. This\
  \ is the Armenia Kim Kardashian failed to expose to the world.\nThat June, Armenia\
  \ made headlines for protests against electricity price hikes. #electricyerevan\
  \ spread like wildfire on Twitter and Facebook. Protesters and reporters came from\
  \ all over the world to showcase the outrage against the 14% tariff increase issued\
  \ by the local power company, Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA), which is partly\
  \ owned by Inter- RAO, a Russian energy company. This third price raise in two years\
  \ marks a more than 60 percent total tariff increase. With a country whose economy\
  \ runs on electricity, these inflated prices would, in turn, increase the price\
  \ of living. I was lucky to partake in these protests during my visit. It was truly\
  \ a life-changing event. People, young and old, chanting and dancing from sunrise\
  \ to sunset. Dedicated protestors sleeping on mattresses and good Samaritans passing\
  \ out apricots and water bottles covered Baghramyan Street. This is the true Armenian\
  \ experience Kim missed out on. While her and Khloe feasted on gata and learned\
  \ to shalaxo on their \u201Clife- changing journey\u201D, I aligned with my fellow\
  \ Armenians against government corruption in an actual life-changing movement. This,\
  \ this was my Armenia- not the faux-glammed up Armenia the Kardashians exhibited\
  \ to the world.\nWhile this was my experience in 2015, a lot has changed during\
  \ my last two visits in 2017 and 2018--two years that, again, were met with protests.\
  \ When our corrupt president, Serzh Sargsyan, was reelected as Prime Minister against\
  \ the will of the people, protests erupted. After over two decades of shadow government\
  \ rule, the people decided that enough was enough. In a bloodless revolution unheard\
  \ of, Nikol Pashinyan, the people's choice, was made Prime Minister. Now, none of\
  \ us living as part of the large diaspora expected this. Heck, my parents had given\
  \ up in any positive change coming to Armenia 27 years ago when they fled the country.\
  \ In the short period that he has been prime minister, there has been an increase\
  \ of jobs and improvement of the economy--this change which I felt in the spirits\
  \ of the people during my last visit. However, there is still a lot that needs to\
  \ be changed, especially regarding women's rights. \nThe point of travel is not\
  \ to indulge in the merry parts of the culture and ignore the unsettling parts,\
  \ but to experience it all: the good, the bad, and the ugly. While there is nothing\
  \ wrong in indulging in a gata or two, speak to the person baking your gata about\
  \ the issues that perplex every day folks. Sometimes, there's more than meets the\
  \ eye than a sweet, nutty treat."
