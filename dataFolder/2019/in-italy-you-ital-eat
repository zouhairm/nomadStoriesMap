Text: "I had never traveled internationally beyond the confines of North America so\
  \ traveling to Italy for the first time was mind blowing, to say the least. My dad\
  \ bought the trip as an early graduation present from university for me, and for\
  \ him, too. \nWe first flew into Venice, and took a boat ride to our hotel that\
  \ was located right on the canal. To see the canal in person was everything I had\
  \ hoped it would be; it was breathtaking. We settled in and the found some delicious\
  \ gnocchi and pizza. We explored Venice for two full days and by the end of day\
  \ three I had already taken over 350 photos because everywhere I looked there was\
  \ something stunning that I just had to remember forever, such as the Bridge of\
  \ Sighs. \n\nDay three we took a train down to Florence. This was my favourite place\
  \ out of the whole trip, due to for my passion for art. We climbed to the top of\
  \ the Dome of the Duomo, which prepares us for our later hike up Mount Vesuvius.\
  \ We explored museums and the streets of Firenze with ease; I was surprised at how\
  \ easy it was to navigate, and everyone was so nice and helpful if we got lost.\
  \ \nWe got to explore the Uffizi Gallery, which made me tear up with joy from seeing\
  \ such amazing works of art in person while in Firenze. It was a surreal and sublime\
  \ experience. By the end of Firenze I had taken about 950 photos total. \n\nOn day\
  \ six we took another travel further south to Roma wherein we got to experience\
  \ the Colosseum, the Roman Forum, the Pantheon and from Roma, we took a day trip\
  \ to Naples to see Pompeii and, la piece de resistance, hike up the side of the\
  \ volcano called Mount Vesuvius. This was a bucket list experience for me. It was\
  \ so surreal that I have to look back on photos to actually make sure I was truly\
  \ there. \nAs an Ancient Greek and Roman Studies joint major with Philosophy and\
  \ a minor in Psychology, traveling to Italy and meeting this other world excited\
  \ me beyond what I thought was possible. And given that I love cultures, travel,\
  \ and the world, I\u2019m positive that traveling to Portugal will have a similar\
  \ effect on me (maybe not the same because I can\u2019t compare two different worlds\
  \ together and come out with the same answer; that wouldn\u2019t be fair to either\
  \ experience).\n\nSo, I hope that I am fortunate enough to spread my wings even\
  \ further to Portugal as it has been on my bucket list since I was a child, and\
  \ what better time to travel than now?"
