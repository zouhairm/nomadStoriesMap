Text: "While I was trying to think what I suppose to write, I became wondering if\
  \ I had to tell only an unreal and incredibly good experience of a trip, because\
  \ to tell you the truth, I only traveled to places in my country with my family\
  \ or now with my husband. And I'm not saying that these experiences weren\u2019\
  t good (far from this), but they basically proved to be exactly as they should be\
  \ - or as I imagined they would be. No big surprises and something that I was not\
  \ expecting to see or feel, at least, you know?\nSo, thinking about that, I decided\
  \ to tell about the only travel story I have that actually was a bit unexpected\
  \ and totally \"A leap into the unknown\". \nIt was about 6 years ago (wow. I had\
  \ not realized it was so far from now\u2026 It\u2019s always scary how fast time\
  \ goes by). Continuing... I had just graduated in Photography and my father decided\
  \ to give me a present. A cruise trip with him and his wife (that\u2019s not my\
  \ mom, by the way). Ok\u2026 I think I literally can stop at this point and the\
  \ title of this essay will be justified. But I'd rather get closer to my 700-word\
  \ limit and tell you more about that experience. I\u2019ve never saw me as a potential\
  \ \u201Ccruise type of person\u201D (because I think there are a kind of people\
  \ who really enjoy the idea of being on a cruise, and other people actually don\u2019\
  t give a damn), mostly when you are 23 years old, just met your new boyfriend and\
  \ is about to travel and \u201Clive\u201D in the same cabin as your dad and your\
  \ stepmother for 2 weeks (which is also the time that I will spend in Portugal,\
  \ without them, if I win this scholarship). Here in Brazil we have an expression\
  \ to define this: Greek's gift (an allusion to the horse that the Greeks gave to\
  \ the Trojans, that was supposed to be a present, but in fact wasn\u2019t). But\
  \ now I really want to talk about the trip itself and why I think the whole experience\
  \ was a leap into the unknown. When I travel to any place, everything is a bunch\
  \ of unknowns at first, but walking around the streets, listen to people talking,\
  \ \"smell the smells\" of the city and feel the flavors, it makes you feel a bit\
  \ part of that. Experiencing the place brings another perspective, another way of\
  \ seeing things and valuing them. And then, the unknown is no longer so unknown.\
  \ But when you\u2019re in a cruise you don\u2019t actually make any type of bond\
  \ (either with the people who are there or with the places you visit). Most of the\
  \ time, people who go on a cruise are families or couples and most of the time,\
  \ they won\u2019t socialize with others. Our ship stopped in 4 places, for what\
  \ I recall\u2026 and we have just a few hours to walk around and try to know that\
  \ place. You can try to take something of that, but the moment has slipped out of\
  \ your hands too quickly. If you blink, the time has gone and you need to get back\
  \ on the ship. It's so frustrating! You are definitely a passenger wherever you\
  \ are \u2013 ship or land, just passing by without actually knowing things (and\
  \ so making them less unknown). Surrounded by literally the same thousands of people\
  \ everyday in a floating resort. People and places that will remain unknown. \n\n\
  p.s. But I have to say that being on a ship in the middle of the ocean has its magic\
  \ and charm: I had never seen such a blue sea and such a starry night \u2013 especially\
  \ while drinking a white Russian."
