Text: "I had always thought that loving a place too much didn't make sense. I always\
  \ had the idea that our homes should be our own bones, and that the only roof we\
  \ needed above our heads should be a starry sky. I used to think that the best land\
  \ to have under your feet would be an unknown one. However, I've changed my mind\
  \ and I wish I could say who is the responsible for that change, but I have to admit\
  \ I don't even know his name. Even so, I like to think that nameless people can\
  \ have an impact on our lives too.\nIt all began when I was in a summer program\
  \ in Boston. The 4th July was in about a week. Of course, it was my first one and,\
  \ for reasons I have already stated here, I didn't quite understand what was all\
  \ that fuss about. Nonetheless, by that time I had already seen certain scenes that\
  \ put some truth in the so talked about \"American Patriotism\". Stores were full\
  \ of American flags painted over every surface that could ever be imagined, from\
  \ t-shirts (for the shy ones), to extravagant hats (in that mad hatter style).\n\
  When I was walking on the streets I decided to take a closer look at the people\
  \ around me. I saw a man and started looking down, at his feet. There it was! No\
  \ surprise, I could already see these red, blue and white socks, those who looked\
  \ alive, screaming how good it was to be American. I'm sure that if I kept analyzing\
  \ his exposed outer shell I would be able to find a few more American flags, but\
  \ I was way too distracted by the look he held on his face. Pride. It was all over\
  \ his face, deep down inside his eyes. He was proud of who he was, proud of the\
  \ land he had his feet on. Maybe he had running in his veins the same blood that\
  \ ran fast and wild in some faceless man in The Boston Tea Party. Maybe his great-great-grandfather\
  \ had been one of the responsible for setting that country free. And that is why\
  \ he was proud. He had reasons to be proud. For a second I thought I could understand\
  \ him, but then I realized that in that moment he represented a whole nation, and\
  \ that was way too much for me to understand, I could only feel that feeling coming\
  \ from him over to me and, actually, that was enough. \nComing out of my thoughts,\
  \ I found myself in the lobby of the dorm I was staying for the summer program.\
  \ Big mirrors and wood furniture decorated the place in such a charming and antique\
  \ way. Around me, the others girls were chatting as loud as their voices could get.\
  \ Most of them were American. We walked on our way to the elevator, the only one\
  \ available in the build. All fifteen of us squeezing to fit in the small steel\
  \ box. Holding our breaths and laughing in excitement. \"You guys know planes are\
  \ safer than elevators, right?\". We continued laughing and tried to ignore the\
  \ fact hat she was a mechanical engineering and was, probably, right. \nWe got to\
  \ the penthouse. The view was extraordinary. The lights of the buildings illuminated\
  \ the night, not as much as the fireworks that were about to explode. It lasted\
  \ some minutes and people exhaled happiness.\nI didn't understand why they felt\
  \ that way. But after taking a closer look at them, I realized that they were not\
  \ in love with the land under their feet. It wasn't about territory. It was about\
  \ people. It was about the American people who had been there since the begging.\
  \ Those who built that country with their bare hands. They were proud of the elders\
  \ who contributed so much, and they were proud of the children, pure hope, that\
  \ would make that nation thrive even more. And only then I understood that. Only\
  \ then I was able to be a part of it."
