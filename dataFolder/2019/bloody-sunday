Text: "I remember really looking forward to it\u2014 it was, after all, a breather\
  \ for me when I was up to my crutches during my undergrad thesis submission week.\
  \ But the weekend getaway trip that my parents had surprisingly sanctioned with\
  \ minimal resistance proved to be quite the nemesis for me.\n\nIt was day 1 of our\
  \ three day trip to Coorg, a heavenly little hill station, situated some 300 miles\
  \ south of my beautiful homeland, Goa. My parents suggested going on an all-girls\
  \ trip, and being part of an oestrogen-filled weekend wouldn\u2019t usually be much\
  \ of a problem, or so I thought. But hours later, I didn\u2019t expect to find myself\
  \ in a sticky situation.\n\nIt was around 7 in the evening, 4 hours post-arrival\
  \ at our resort, and my sister and mother had gone to the resort\u2019s outdoor\
  \ activity area. I decided to stay in as I was feeling indisposed; we had to take\
  \ two local Indian buses and wobble through the winding Ghats to finally reach our\
  \ holy grail, and so I told myself that I was just tired from all the traveling.\
  \ My body then told me otherwise. I began feeling a stinging pain in my lower abdomen\u2014\
  \ like a thousand needles piercing through all at once. Yes, you guessed right,\
  \ it was my \u2018time of the month\u2019, and then and there, I decided that this\
  \ trip was ruined. Period.\n\nWhen my \u2018girl gang\u2019 returned to the room\
  \ at around 9, Marise announced with glee that they\u2019d discovered a few cosy\
  \ eateries around, and with a very well-exhibited fake cheer, masked underneath\
  \ a screaming teenager, I marched on to the closest restaurant, along with the unsuspecting\
  \ duo. I think it should be a universal fact by now that cravings do come alive\
  \ when you\u2019re on your period; the coorgi cuisine knew no bounds for me as I\
  \ ate whatever came my way\u2014 I could well be a food blogger\u2019s best company!\n\
  \nThat night, as I lay awake in bed, the most recurring thoughts in my mind were\
  \ \u201CWhy did we ever choose to come to a hill station? Why couldn\u2019t we go\
  \ to a warm, sunny place or just stay at home?\u201D Going back into the claws of\
  \ college life seemed like a better option, really.\n\nOn Sunday, the next morning,\
  \ I woke up looking much to the likes of a flesh-deprived Megan Fox in \u2018Jennifer\u2019\
  s Body\u2019\u2014 although that would have been a compliment. When I checked my\
  \ phone, I saw a couple of texts from a friend of mine, whom I may have whined to\
  \ about my situation more than once. After a run-through of the million messages\
  \ I received, what I gathered was that I had to make the most of my vacation, stop\
  \ being a suck-up, and realise that I absolutely cannot change my situation. And\
  \ I did just that.\n\nMarise had arranged for a coffee trail, as coffee is considered\
  \ to be the pride of Coorg. One would say I had to quite literally wake up and smell\
  \ the coffee! Given my recent epiphany that others aren\u2019t supposed to balance\
  \ on the exact edge of my emotional knife, I decided to put on my shoes, plaster\
  \ a smile on my face, and get going. It was a 30 minute bus ride from the resort\
  \ to the coffee plantation, and we had befriended a couple who had an overly excited\
  \ kid along with them. \u201CThere are two main species of coffee beans in the world:\
  \ Arabica and Robusta\u201D was the central idea of the coffee trail, but it wasn\u2019\
  t the best lesson we took home that day. After an hour and a half of stumbling through\
  \ hilly terrain, we found ourselves on a peak, overlooking nothing but densely forested\
  \ mountains adorned with mist, with a cup of coffee in hand, attempting to conceal\
  \ our awestruck facial expressions, and failing miserably! The pink and orange hues,\
  \ courtesy of the dying sun, complemented by the crisp weather was enough to repel\
  \ the idea that beauty could ever be defined or delimited. It was, by far, my favourite\
  \ \u2018time of the month\u2019."
