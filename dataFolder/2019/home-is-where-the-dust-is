Text: "As the sun began to rise atop the red mountains, I got my first glimpse of\
  \ the dusty desert that we would call home for the next week. Affectionately called\
  \ home by those who come here every year, we were about to share this home with\
  \ 70,000 of our new best friends.   \n\nTo have arrived at the entry gates of Burning\
  \ Man was in itself no small feat. We had driven a vintage motorhome from Vancouver,\
  \ BC across one country border and four state borders to journey here.  We navigated\
  \ through mountains ranges and the screeching motor of the vehicle cried out as\
  \ we climbed each hill as though it might be the last. We often wondered if we would\
  \ instead be spending a week on the side of the Interstate. After three days of\
  \ driving with bated breath, we arrived. When we pulled into the entry gate we let\
  \ out sighs of relief, only to be met with a smoking, overheating engine. At that\
  \ point, I would have pushed. Thankfully, it was not necessary and the engine had\
  \ eight days to recover before we\u2019d make the trek home. \nThe preparations\
  \ began months beforehand to ensure we had everything we needed to be self-sufficient;\
  \ radical self-reliance is one of the ten guiding principles of Burning Man. To\
  \ participate in this community is no small endeavour. This is not a festival to\
  \ attend where one can purchase food and drinks. In fact, there is nothing to purchase\
  \ other than coffee and ice. Aside from those two items, money does you no good\
  \ here. If you forgot something, you\u2019ll go without, or need to ask a kind soul\
  \ who will hopefully lend you, or gift you, what you are missing. Money and bartering\
  \ are not the ways of this community.  \n\nWe were confident that we had absolutely\
  \ everything we needed, and then some. We were wrong, and the one item we forgot\
  \ would be integral to our survival over the next eight days. We forgot one single\
  \ item \u2013 a can opener. How was I to get into my Chef Boyardee Beefaroni? Not\
  \ to mention all the soup we brought. The canned goods would have been useless had\
  \ it not been for the kindness of one of our camping neighbours. After laughing\
  \ heartily at our expense, it is rather funny in hindsight but certainly wasn\u2019\
  t at the time, they let us use their can opener. Every. Single. Day. Often several\
  \ times a day.    \n\nCan opener aside, we were wholly prepared and gladly shared\
  \ our provisions with others. We actively participated in the communal effort principal\
  \ by creating a shaded space that provided reprieve from the 104-degree heat. Coffee\
  \ and Bailey\u2019s was served in the morning, followed by beer and shots of Tequila\
  \ as the day progressed. While one is intended to be wholly self-reliant, it was\
  \ nothing short of amazing to witness the sense of community that abounded in Black\
  \ Rock City, a city that exists for less than a month each and every year. To put\
  \ 70,000 strangers in a barren desert together and feel nothing but love, see countless\
  \ acts of kindness, and feel only positive energy had me continually awe-struck.\
  \   \n\nTo ask someone what it\u2019s like to join the week-long community in the\
  \ pop-up city of Black Rock is unfair. It\u2019s an event that one must experience\
  \ first-hand as there is no possible way to portray the experience in words that\
  \ would do it justice. Attending isn\u2019t just that, it\u2019s participating and\
  \ engaging in a community that exists for what feels like a fleeting moment every\
  \ year. If I had to describe my experience, I would utter the only word that would\
  \ suffice: surreal. I\u2019ve only been once, but I yearn to return home and join\
  \ the community again."
