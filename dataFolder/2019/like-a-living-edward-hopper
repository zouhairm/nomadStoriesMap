Text: "I'm travelling alone, and tonight I\u2019m sick of my own voice in my head.\
  \ \nI pace down Smith Street, and the sight of the clientele at St Crispin\u2019\
  s Bar - bright, young, unlonely Melbournians - is almost enough to send me shuddering\
  \ back to my room, where my alone-ness won\u2019t be exposed like the brickwork\
  \ and lightbulbs.\nI brace myself, then try, and fail, to open the glass door. I\
  \ stare at it until I\u2019m let in.\n\n\u201CIs there any space at the bar, please?\u201D\
  \ \n\nThat sounds like something a grown-up would say. \n\n\u201CWe might have some\
  \ room upstairs. I\u2019ll show you up.\u201D\n\nI follow her, winding between the\
  \ tables and out, to my surprise, into the garden. She raps smartly on a white door.\
  \ \n\n\u201CWe can only try. It\u2019s always worth a try,\u201D she twinkles prettily.\
  \ \n\nThe door swings open. I step into a small, dark, beautiful bar. It\u2019s\
  \ like being inside an Edward Hopper. Inky green tiles halo a sparse handful of\
  \ tables. Warm Australian accents murmur, infusing with soft jazz. \n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  ve invented a new drink,\u201D smiles the mustachio\u2019d barman as I tuck my coat\
  \ and bag under a barstool. \n\n\u201CWanna try it?\u201D\n\n\u201CWhy not?\u201D\
  \n\nJack, a happy-eyed Melbournian, mixes capsicum, sugar,  gin, vermouth, and a\
  \ touch of chilli. He and his partner Alan are returning to the old ways of preserving,\
  \ rather than pickling ingredients. He tells me all about vermouth \u2013 an aromatized\
  \ botanical wine, and rhapsodises on obscure herbaceous ingredients like wormwood\
  \ and rosehip. \n\nI sit, dry-mouthed, until he\u2019s finished, then take my first\
  \ sip. \n\nThe chilli hits the back of my throat. I cough, tasting syrup. \n\nI\
  \ tell him it's delicious. \n\nJack\u2019s pouring shots.\n\n\u201CWill you partake?\
  \ No charge.\u201D\n\nThe bourbon lines my belly like warm silk. \n\nI think about\
  \ Edward Hopper again. Nighthawks.  Automat. Cigar Bar Woman. Lonely people occupying\
  \ a public space. I\u2019m enjoying propping up the bar, floating in and out of\
  \ conversation. \n\nThe kick from the chilli doesn\u2019t dissipate. My mouth feels\
  \ tingly and clean. \n\nJack calls out: \n\n\u201CAlan! Can you believe we\u2019\
  ve not had a Daiquiri yet?\u201D\n\n\u201CTerrible,\u201D answers Alan gravely.\
  \ \u201CRemedy this immediately\u201D.\n\nJack tilts his head at me.\n\n\u201CAre\
  \ you getting involved?\u201D\n\nI remember the carefully-counted bank notes in\
  \ my purse. \n\n\u201CWhat\u2019s the damage?\u201D\n\n\u201CNo damage,\u201D he\
  \ waves me away, \u201Cwe always need a guinea pig.\u201D\n\nThis is the coolest\
  \ night of my life. I\u2019ve always suspected that there were people who live this\
  \ way. Now I\u2019m one of them. \n\nJack mixes potions like an apothecary. Other\
  \ customers come up to the bar to pay their bills. $80. $100. $200. $400. I wonder\
  \ who they are. I wonder who they think I am.   \n\n\u201CWe live on Daiquiris when\
  \ we work together. Sometimes the bar\u2019s three deep, we\u2019re taking in $35,000\
  \ dollars a night. We need the sugar.\u201D\n\nBy the time I finish my Daiquiri\
  \ I can feel my heartbeat in my eyeballs. \n\nI watch Jack deftly beat the seeds\
  \ out of a pomegranate for a Sloe Phoenix, muddling them with blueberry gin, apricot\
  \ shrub, and lemon. Alan lists the ingredients of the Hotel Nationale \u2013 pineapple-infused\
  \ rum, aniseed, peach foam, and lemon; and the Charlie Chaplin No. 3 \u2013 sloe\
  \ gin, apricot brandy, and lemon (\u201Cit\u2019s all percentages, all balances\u201D\
  ).\n\nJack places a dish of pomegranate seeds before me like an offering. \n\n\u201C\
  You can have the family discount,\u201D he whispers conspiratorially, \u201Cit\u2019\
  s not our booze\u201D. \n\nHe\u2019s wearing cuffs that stop his sleeves from rolling\
  \ down. Before serving me a drink he tastes it by dipping a straw into it, sealing\
  \ it with his thumb, then draining it into his mouth. \n\nI offer my hand out to\
  \ him. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m Michelle.\u201D\n\n\u201CPleasure,\u201D says Jack. \u201C\
  Your hair\u2019s great\u201D. \n\nMy hair\u2019s dry and light in the mild Australian\
  \ winter. I look like Marc Bolan as a redhead. \n\n\u201CAh, thanks. It\u2019s a\
  \ bit gnarly today, it looks like a pack of squirrels fighting\u201D\n\nJack roars\
  \ at this. \n\nI bite into an over-ripe, flavourless pineapple. \n\n\u201CWhat are\
  \ you going to call that new drink? The one with the chilli?\u201D\n\nJack frowns.\n\
  \n\u201CI\u2019ll serve it in my bar, Union Electric, so it needs to be something\
  \ Electric\u201D\n\nHe gazes thoughtfully at me for a moment. Then grins. \n\n\u201C\
  Electric Squirrel.\u201D"
