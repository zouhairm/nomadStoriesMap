  \ \nI pursed my lips to try to make my smile disappear because I couldn\u2019t actually\
  \ remove it. We might have been at a funeral, but I was having fun. \n\nWe were\
  \ in a small village in southern China, so tiny that if it had a name, I never learned\
  \ it. It had one narrow street, about a mile long, running through the center with\
  \ about 10 homes on either side. Some were brick and concrete style homes, recently\
  \ built by a government planner while the others were crumbling stone or wood houses\
  \ built by hand many generations back. \n\nI had come to this small town with my\
  \ friend, a Chinese guy named Chen. It was his ancestral homeland and current residence\
  \ of his grandparents who we had come to visit. Everyone who lived there was an\
  \ ancestor of the Chen family line going back thousands of years. But, like many\
  \ villages in modern China, the young people had abandoned it for better opportunities\
  \ in the cities. Most of the year the village was filled with elderly and the babies\
  \ they were charged to look after. \n\nBut not today. Today was the second day of\
  \ the Chinese New Year and it was filled beyond capacity. Also called Spring Festival,\
  \ everyone is expected to leave the cities and return to their hometowns to spend\
  \ a week with their family. So this little sleepy village of a few dozen elderly\
  \ had transformed into a street carnival. The one lane was filled with a line of\
  \ cars and and even longer line of people. We had all come this day to celebrate\
  \ the death of one of the residence, and I couldn\u2019t believe my luck to be included\
  \ in this unique ceremony (which explained my nonstop smiling). \n\nThe woman died\
  \ old, with many children and grandchildren to carry on her legacy, so this was\
  \ to be a ceremony to celebrate a life well lived, which explained the carnival,\
  \ not somber, atmosphere. In addition to the hundred plus \u201Crelatives\u201D\
  \ (Everyone who came from this village claimed to be related despite not all having\
  \ recent ties), the family hired marching bands, performers and others to make sure\
  \ this woman was honored. Each marching band, made up of anywhere between 5-20 people,\
  \ were standing in a different section of the street practicing. In front of me\
  \ was a group of old men with wood sticks and hand cymbals playing a soulful traditional\
  \ Chinese tune. Behind me were ten young trumpeters dressed in military uniforms\
  \ playing, \u201CWhen the Saint Go Marching In.\u201D I couldn\u2019t make out the\
  \ songs of the other marching bands further down the line, but the cacophonous noises\
  \ filled the little village and scattered all the wandering chickens to the far\
  \ part of the fields to catch their worms in peace. \n\nMy friend ran off and returned\
  \ with some armbands. Mine was white, his was blue, (to signify family, though he\
  \ barely knew her) and he handed me a red one to stuff in my pocket. \u201CThe ghost\
  \ will follow us because we are wearing these,\u201D he said as he helped tie it\
  \ high up on my arm. \u201CThen at her grave we will switch to the red one. Ghosts\
  \ don\u2019t like red so she won\u2019t follow up back to the town and she will\
  \ stay at her grave.\u201D \n\nMy friend also handed me some bright colored flowers.\
  \ He himself got a pole with white fabric decorated with dragons and more bright\
  \ flowers. We were to shake and twirl them as we walked. All the noise and bright\
  \ colors were to entice the ghost to follow us away from her home to her final resting\
  \ place. We were all to make as much noise as we could, fireworks going off every\
  \ few feet, as we marched into the fields where her ancestral grave was located.\
  \ Then at the grave we would drop all our decorations, stop all the music, change\
  \ our arm bands to red, and walk silently back to the village in hopes the ghost\
  \ wouldn\u2019t notice us leaving. \n\nWe had come to walk the dead back home."
