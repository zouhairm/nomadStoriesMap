Text: "We had just completed a 3 day trek through the Routeburn Track in the South\
  \ Island of New Zealand. Trekking in New Zealand was one of the most beautiful and\
  \ surreal experiences of my life. Every direction you looked was so stunningly picturesque\
  \ and jaw droppingly beautiful that it was hard to stay on the track without getting\
  \ too distracted and falling off of the edge. To get to this trail we had to drive\
  \ our car to one side of the track and hire someone to pick up our car and drive\
  \ it over to the opposite side where we would be coming out. Hiring someone to move\
  \ your car for you sounds a bit odd and risky but in New Zealand honesty is their\
  \ number one policy. We had lived there for about four months at the time so we\
  \ figured we could trust this system. We also owned a car that was nearing the end\
  \ of its lifespan of which we had bought for $500 so if that person decided that\
  \ that was the car worth stealing then so be it. \n\nExhausted, blistered, and ready\
  \ to go home we spotted our car in the parking lot. It was my turn to drive and\
  \ this was the last thing I wanted to do. A two hour drive back to Dunedin right\
  \ before the sun was about to set was not ideal at the moment. Stiffly I got behind\
  \ the wheel as we made our way out and back onto the road home. Another thing New\
  \ Zealand is good for is guaranteeing no cellphone reception so unfortunately for\
  \ us we weren't really sure of which direction home was in. Coming up to the intersection\
  \ I was unsure of which way to turn. It wasn't until the brakes of the car stopped\
  \ working that I abruptly made a left turn in absolute fear and shock that we wouldn't\
  \ be able to stop. This has happened once before when my friend had been driving\
  \ the car but never had I experienced it myself. It was quite terrifying as one\
  \ could imagine. I continuously pumped the brakes of the car and eventually they\
  \ began to work properly again. Fortunately this was just the adrenaline rush I\
  \ needed to stay awake for the rest of the car ride. \n\nWe continued onward and\
  \ arrived in what appeared to be a very small town of an estimated 30+ residents.\
  \ That was the moment we realized we were going in the wrong direction. In an attempt\
  \ to turn around the brakes decided that this would once again be the best time\
  \ to fail me. With no control of stopping the car we ended up in a shallow ditch.\
  \ As the wheels spun tirelessly and the sun began to sink we could clearly see the\
  \ predicament we were about to be in. Three young girls in a desolate town in a\
  \ foreign country with no working phones and a car in a ditch, what could possibly\
  \ go wrong? \n\nWe made the failed attempt of throwing down sticks and leaves to\
  \ try to gain traction but nothing seemed to be working. About twenty minutes passed\
  \ before we agreed that one of us would go look for help while the others stayed\
  \ by the car. Suddenly a white truck rolled up in front of us with three massive\
  \ black dogs barking at us from the bed of the truck. We stared forward mouths agape\
  \ and feet cemented onto the ground. Motionless we watched as the window slowly\
  \ and eerily rolled down revealing the face of a mysterious man. \n\n\"You girls\
  \ need some help?\" We responded with three nodding heads.\n\nIn no time at all\
  \ this man attached a chain from the back of his truck to our car and pulled it\
  \ out of the ditch almost effortlessly. We smiled blankly and waved as he drove\
  \ off and was never to be seen again. That was the moment I learned how genuine\
  \ of a country New Zealand truly is. I didn't expect to find ourselves in the middle\
  \ of a ditch before sundown that night and I definitely didn't expect to find such\
  \ generosity and kindness in a foreign place."
