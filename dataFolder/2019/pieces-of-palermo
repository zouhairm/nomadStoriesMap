Text: "People and places are usually always more than meets the eye, and Sicily certainly\
  \ was. The culture and commitment to using the land, understanding the seasons,\
  \ appreciating offerings of offal, and humble frugality is something Melbourne is\
  \ beginning to understand, but in most of Sicily, is just a way of life. Palermo\
  \ raw and sensual; bustling markets, moving coastlines, rich palaces, dark history\
  \ and a sense that there\u2019s always more.\n\nAfter two weeks of soaking up Italy\u2019\
  s North and Central, I was ready to get nitty and gritty in the rough and rich terrain\
  \ and history I'd been longing to know on a personal level for so long. You will\
  \ always get a few warnings, as we did moving through Naples, and then onto Sicily,\
  \ and yes, take them into consideration, but prepare more than anything to be surprised\u2026\
  \n\nThe airport is a fair ramble to the city, but using the cab share option you\
  \ can save a few euros and get to most main destinations in the city centre. You\u2019\
  ll find, as with most places in Europe, that the main streets are a funny mix of\
  \ the familiar large name shops and convenience stores, juxtaposed with rich, wondrous\
  \ architecture and grand landscapes. Take a left turn down that street, and you\
  \ could try to imagine yourself wondering the set of Il Gattopardo.\n\nWithering\
  \ the days away, explore the cosmopolitan Palazzo dei Normann where you can find\
  \ the Palatine Chapel and experience a breathtaking example of Arab-Norman-Byzantine\
  \ architecture, wander through the Villa Bonanno Gardens on your way to the Capuchin\
  \ Catacombs, stop at Caffetteria del Corsosome where the owner, Pino, makes some\
  \ of the freshest Granita. Trust me, you\u2019ll need a moment of sunshine and simple\
  \ joy before the next stop!\n\nMonte di Piet\xE0, the perfect suburb to stay, you\
  \ find yourself realising, \u2018I need more time here, but I\u2019m exactly where\
  \ I need to be.\u2019 While salty air and formidable heat rise from the brickwork\
  \ and from the architecture, families are setting up restaurants & welcoming spaces\
  \ for travellers, and locals are sitting on corners watching the world go by with\
  \ a fierce protectiveness.\n\nAfter a day of sightseeing and an afternoon nap, take\
  \ a stroll to Buttic\xE8, with an award-winning, thoughtful wine list curated by\
  \ Sommelier, Salvatore Fanale. They use all fresh ingredients in the kitchen, sourced\
  \ from the local markets. Looking over one of Palermo\u2019s historic squares, it\u2019\
  s the perfect spot to take in the best Sicily has to offer with rich people watching\
  \ opportunities while pondering your next day.\n\nTake a break from sightseeing!\
  \ You\u2019re on holiday! You probably had a few too many Birra Moretti\u2019s purchased\
  \ from 15-year-old boys looking after their parents' shop and just need a day to\
  \ take in the culture and of course, the beach! If you want crystal clear waters,\
  \ white sand, snorkelling and pedal boats for hire, take the time to navigate your\
  \ way to Mondello Beach.\n\nUsing public transport on the trip to Mondello, just\
  \ as you\u2019ve heard, or will hear, like anywhere in Sicily, can be an adventure\
  \ in itself, and if you don\u2019t have a hire car or want to splurge on a taxi,\
  \ you\u2019re going to grab the 806 bus. After a ridiculously fresh snack and vino\
  \ at Alimentari A CASA DI where everything is made fresh and bountiful; bouncing\
  \ burrata and fresh calamari, I also got my cheeks pinched by the chef\u2019s mamma.\
  \ and instructed to \u2018MANGIA!\u201D \n\nYou\u2019ve been in the sun and sand\
  \ all day, swimming and sweating,  (I could go on about Osteria Mangia e Bevi, the\
  \ stone walls and simple authenticity), what really wraps up a day like that is\
  \ quintessential, it\u2019s what we do in Australia after a day at the beach, order\
  \ takeaway! I thought I\u2019d never say this, but when you\u2019re in Palermo,\
  \ you have to go to Cerino d'Oro Polli alla Brace e Pizze, for the best rotisserie\
  \ chicken I\u2019ve ever had. All the locals go here, and you\u2019ll have to wait\
  \ in line, or call and reserve this chook. Enjoy at your home away from home, watching\
  \ the sunset on a loud balcony with a chilled Nerello Mascalese. Molto Buona!"
