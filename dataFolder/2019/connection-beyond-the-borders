Text: "After coming back to Bangkok from Phuket, I shifted to a nice hostel which\
  \ was a bit far from the city but peaceful. But, I woke up with a noise in the morning!\
  \ Travelers can relate to that! A traveler was leaving early. I looked down and\
  \ he greeted \u201CBonjour\u201D! I asked, are you leaving? He said \u201Cyes and\
  \ sorry for the noise\u201D. It\u2019s okay! I said and quickly moved my eyes and\
  \ checked my phone. Thought about to utilize the time by doing some research on\
  \ \u201Chow to enjoy my last day in Bangkok!\u201D \n\nWhile getting down from my\
  \ bed, a guy greeted me with a smile. He was on the same lower bunk! I smiled back\
  \ and said Hi. A few minutes pause, then he asked, where are you from? I introduced\
  \ myself and told him about my journey that started from Malaysia, a year before.\
  \ \u201CInteresting! I am From Germany, a solo traveler and working on my own venture\u201D\
  \ \u2013 he said! After conversing about our trips, we realized that we forgot to\
  \ ask each other\u2019s name. I said, I am Iffat and you? He said his name. I was\
  \ in rush, so I had to excuse and left the discussion for a quick shower.\n\nAgain!\
  \ Messy me\u2026I forgot to take my towel and came back with my wet hair. I found\
  \ him looking at me and suddenly we exchanged an eye contact! Without thinking for\
  \ a while, he said, \u201Chey, I don\u2019t have a touristic plan but since I am\
  \ here for long time, I could show you some places if you would like to come with\
  \ me\u201D. I was like, \u201Cwell that would be awesome!\u201D He shared his plan\
  \ about watching a film, going to night market, roam around and dinner. I was excited\
  \ to explore with a person with whom I met just before half an hour. Meeting new\
  \ people is always something special to me! That become more special when you find\
  \ a quick connection with the companion. Even that is for a day!\n\nThe transportation\
  \ in Bangkok is tourist friendly! Though last night I got lost but I can\u2019t\
  \ blame the system for that. I was not following the routs properly in the dark\
  \ and couldn\u2019t find the right direction. However, the biker police helped me\
  \ to reach to my hostel. Also, the MRT was close to my hostel and mostly we traveled\
  \ by that. Sometimes we walked and took BTS line but overall the experience was\
  \ great! You just have to read and follow!! While travelling me always prefer to\
  \ walk and use public transports to know the city like a local. \n\nWe reached to\
  \ the movie theatre, purchased tickets and had coffee! The movie and our chemistry\
  \ both were awesome! After finishing the movie we moved to the next destination\
  \ called night market in Ratchada. The time we reached, it was afternoon and the\
  \ people were preparing the market for the evening. He took me to the top of the\
  \ building, from where the whole market looks like a rainbow. Also, the city during\
  \ sunset! Wow! I am sure very few people have experienced that view. We walked,\
  \ talked and shared stories about our personal life. \nIn the evening, we went to\
  \ Lumpini Park, a peaceful place in this crowded city. I would say a place you must\
  \ visit if you are a nature lover. We walked towards the lake, sat under the tree.\
  \ That moment was precious. \n\nWhen we went back to hostel it was already 10 PM.\
  \ The entire hostel were calm and the balcony was peaceful! We decided not to sleep\
  \ because we couldn\u2019t afford to miss the chance to talk to each other! We found\
  \ similarities, common choices, and topics to discuss and share our cultures.\n\
  Our friendship became stronger that we have decided to meet each other again! Though\
  \ that never happened. We might not see each other in future but we will never stop\
  \ hoping to meet again in this small world and complete our unfulfilled friendship\
  \ that could create more memories for the upcoming years! And I must say this is\
  \ the best part of solo traveling!"
