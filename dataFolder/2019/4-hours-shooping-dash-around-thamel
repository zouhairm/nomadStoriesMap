Text: "My last day in Kathmandu and I only have 4 hours to shop for souvenirs. Souvenir\
  \ is a must in my country after a holiday trip; it\u2019s a way for saying \u201C\
  thanks for waiting\u201D and \u201Capologies for the inconvenience\u201D that my\
  \ absence may cause. I need to quickly list some names and their appropriate gift.\n\
  \nMy mom\u2019s number 1. She\u2019d love a cashmere scarf. Kashmir region, which\
  \ consists of few countries among other Nepal, is famous for producing fine, soft,\
  \ downy, winter undercoat. Many shops opened in Thamel but only one highly recommended\
  \ in TripAdvisor: SK Handicraft. \n\nBut alas, the shop was renovated. I followed\
  \ the arrows appointing new store front in the back alley, but the house was quiet.\
  \ I check the TripAdvisor once more and found a phone number left by Keshab, the\
  \ owner and called, but no answer. So, I\u2019m back to square one and consult the\
  \ Internet if there is another recommended shop. \n\nWhile bargaining in another\
  \ shop nearby, my phone was ringing, and what do you know, Keshab was calling me\
  \ back. He told me that he had opened his store. I dashed back to SK Handicraft\
  \ and thank goodness I did. The similar scarf I was bargaining for, was Rs1,000\
  \ cheaper in SK Handicraft.\n\nAfter completing my purchase, I asked if he knows\
  \ a good T-shirt shop nearby. Dad was next on the list. Keshab gladly showed me\
  \ the way to his acquaintance. It\u2019s in the alley across the street; he don\u2019\
  t have to take me there, but he still do just because. I cannot thank him enough.\
  \ Tacky yak T-shirt for Dad is done.\n\nKeshab then introduced me to another store\
  \ that sold hemp bags and traditional woven wallets and finally we part ways. Hemp\
  \ is sort of cannabis plant that grows wild in Nepal. The fiber is strong and durable\
  \ and makes for attractive wallets and bags. I buy some coin purses for few close\
  \ friends and a Nepal\u2019s flag for another friend who specifically ask for flag.\n\
  \nThe hemp bag seller in turn point me to a tea shop where I can buy tea and fridge\
  \ magnets for my colleagues at the office. I have asked everywhere for the gypsum\
  \ fridge magnet, just to check the price and Rs200 is the cheapest so far. However,\
  \ the tea shop allowed Rs150 for the magnets. He told me that he gave me good price\
  \ because his friend was the one who brought me. This maybe a sales pitch so I buy\
  \ more, but he already had me sold at Rs150.\n\nI only have an hour or so left.\
  \ Last item that I want was for myself: a singing bowl. Copper handicraft was widely\
  \ exported from Nepal. In 2016-2017, Nepal exported handicraft products worth 5.4billion\
  \ rupees and metal handicraft contributed around 25% of the export according to\
  \ Kathmandu Post. Religious item is especially popular in countries that practiced\
  \ Buddhism like China, Vietnam, and Bhutan.\n\nSo far, My modus operandi \u2018\
  asking for recommendation\u2019 worked beautifully for me, so I asked for a recommendation\
  \ from the tea shop clerk. It worked like a charm. The tea shop guy took me to his\
  \ brother shop that sold singing bowls. They don\u2019t pretend that a singing bowl\
  \ was handmade and I really appreciated that honesty.\n\nThe singing bowl purchase\
  \ wrap it up. I run back to my hostel and pack all my souvenir in my backpack. After\
  \ a quick dinner, my shuttle came to pick me up to airport. I\u2019m saying goodbye\
  \ to Kathmandu and it\u2019s beautiful local connectivity."
