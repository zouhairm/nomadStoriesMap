Text: "I came from one of the metropolitan city at Indonesia named Jakarta. It has\
  \ been five months for the refreshment of my soul, I decided to live at Bali. Living\
  \ at Bali is a new point to connect with the ground of my being. \nWhile living\
  \ in other city, it is important to having a connection with the local to make me\
  \ feel like home and secure. One of the best way to having a connection with the\
  \ local is to be a witness and experienced the unique culture from this splendid\
  \ island of god, Bali. \nAmongst many cultural and ceremonies offerings at Bali,\
  \ an interesting event that I don't want to miss is when the Hindus of Bali celebrate\
  \ the coming of the Balinese New Year. The day marks the first day of the New Year\
  \ according to the Saka Balinese calendar. As a year on this calendar is 420 days,\
  \ it falls on a different date each year following the dark moon of the spring equinox\
  \ with the ritual of Nyepi. For Balinese, Nyepi is an important Hindu celebration\
  \ and extremely special to be on the island for both locals and visitors. There\
  \ are number of ceremonies that must be performed for purification and to ensure\
  \ good luck and fortune for the year ahead. \nIn the local language, Nyepi meaning\
  \ to keep silent and serenity in a day fully dedicated to connect more closely with\
  \ God. All daily activities from 6 am to 6 am following day throughout Bali will\
  \ stop and closed, even the airport as well. No planes will land or take off, all\
  \ traffic across Bali will be stopped for one full day. People are not allowed to\
  \ go out into the streets. At night the island descends into a blackness with no\
  \ lights or fires to be seen and not allowed to make noise which may disturb others.\
  \ \nThe best time to watch the festivities is the night before Nyepi, at sunset\
  \ time is possibly the most exciting and spectacular must see event on the island\
  \ as each village will hold a ritual of \"Pengrupukan\". This is the moment when\
  \ the Balinese parade a procession of \"Ogoh-ogoh\" festival. The parade will also\
  \ be followed with Balinese traditional dance or attraction dominated by the youth.\
  \ I love to see the dancer opening and tell the story of their Ogoh-ogoh in front\
  \ of the judges. With beautiful and colorful traditional costumes they are dancing\
  \ attractively following the Balinese traditional music at the background. The Ogoh-ogoh\
  \ are a giant statues usually made from natural materials such as wood, bamboo and\
  \ paper. Ogoh-ogoh mostly representing monsters from Hindu mythology and form scary\
  \ giant creature, the character of Bhuta Kala or the evil spirit. By torching and\
  \ parading the ogoh-ogoh, it is believed any evil spirits that have brought disease\
  \ and misery to the island during the past year will also been banished and cleansing\
  \ of all evil influences and malevolent spirits in life. Each Ogoh-ogoh is representing\
  \ the creativity of each village, called \"Banjar\". To keep this tradition is also\
  \ to appreciate the creation of the Balinese artist, which possesses high value\
  \ of art, theme and entertainment. \nAfter the procession of Ogoh-ogoh, the pinnacle\
  \ of the entire rituals is Nyepi, as a day for meditation and self reflection through\
  \ prayers, even fasting for the Balinese. While staying inside with no light and\
  \ very less activities might seem boring, for me beside I can have a full day rest,\
  \ this is definitely a best time to respect and having a connection with the Balinese\
  \ tradition. And as like the Balinese that day, have myself a silence time to get\
  \ more closer with my God. \nBali's Nyepi is a wondrous experience to be truly appreciated.\
  \ The clear air and silence from a whole island is quite memorable. When the night\
  \ falls, without any light millions of stars visible and look brighter than most\
  \ people will have ever seen before. This moment will make you realize there is\
  \ a greater power in this universe that holds our life. The quiet and peaceful rhyme\
  \ of serenity at the island is an unique culture you can't find in anywhere else\
  \ around the globe."
