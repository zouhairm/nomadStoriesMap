Text: "I'm a control freak, and I enjoy making travel plans. I enjoy building up that\
  \ sweet anticipation of the well-deserved holiday by Googling tips by local nomads\
  \ and locals alike; making a holiday bucket list. Even if I booked months in advance,\
  \ the Universe decided to pull the carpet under my life and shock my plans of making\
  \ plans. And came January, I climbed up the stairs to a plane heading towards Bali,\
  \ with no idea what I was going to do once there. \n\nPacked with anxiety of colouring\
  \ outside the box by having to improvise my holiday itinerary, I landed in Denpasar\
  \ and was hit in the face by that exotic humid air once stepping out of the plane.\
  \ I took a taxi to a well-reviewed surf camp, and arrived to a hostel-type of an\
  \ establishment in Canggu. Canggu, according to quick research, is the home of many\
  \ expats who live the digital nomad life from a far-away-home-office. Hipster coffee,\
  \ avocado toast and activated carbon burger buns, find it all here. I got sucked\
  \ into a strange limbo of the \"eat, sleep, surf, repeat\" lifestyle that a surf\
  \ camp can be: from week to another, same surf lessons, same weekly program, same\
  \ songs, same jokes, just the guests change. Then reset button is hit again. I can\
  \ imagine how easy it would be to get enchanted by that as a lifestyle, and thus,\
  \ it was important for me to leave. And by leaving, I understood something. Had\
  \ I booked weeks on end on this camp, I would have regretted it after a few days.\
  \ Contrary to my nature, I hadn't. I was free.\n\nAnd the true adventure started.\
  \ I was recommended by fellow camp guests to go to Ubud, so Ubud it was. Humid paradise\
  \ with an excessive portion of the wet season that wrapped the exotic island to\
  \ quick showers daily, Ubud was a glimpse of the \"real\" Bali. Sleepy in nature,\
  \ rich with culture, but no matter how much I loved the green luscious jungle-meets-rice\
  \ fields of Ubud, the best part was that I was able to leave it after 3 days of\
  \ morning-to-evening pouring rain. I had consumed the city with an immense hunger\
  \ of the new, and was now ready to leave this lazy lover behind me, as I realized\
  \ that I was meant to roam the windier coastal Bali with less rain. \n\nNext recommendation\
  \ took me Sanur, the harbour town where most of the boats to neighbouring islands\
  \ leave. Determined to head to the Gili Islands after some vibrant party life, I\
  \ was surprised to find out that the only boats not cancelled due to stormy sea\
  \ conditions left to Nusa Lembongan. Completely ignored by my quick online searches,\
  \ I was curious to try it out. One rocky ride later I found myself on an island\
  \ nearly absent of tourists. Gentle air and even more friendlier locals welcomed\
  \ me to a small island cuddled by mangroves and veined by bumpy narrow streets you\
  \ could scooter around in less than a day. I spend another 3 days with the best\
  \ yoga lessons (Serenity Yoga Lembongan) and the most stunning sunsets of my life.\
  \ Yet again, had I made plans with fixed bookings and travel itineraries, I would\
  \ have never ended up here. \n\nThe rest of my holiday was met with dozens of locals\
  \ and travellers keen on sharing their tips on locations and activities: all normally\
  \ unknown sources of travel plans on my holidays. It was scary at first, but not\
  \ even the second week into the travel it came naturally. People and their stories\
  \ were the best influence on my route, and I found new sides of myself by letting\
  \ the powers of the nature set roadblocks and open new paths for me. I was like\
  \ a lazy manta ray floating according to the sea currents, with my jaws open for\
  \ anything delicious that might happen on my way. Isn't that the perfect counter\
  \ action to the full-planned everyday life I needed a break from? The planner went\
  \ planless, and had the adventure of a lifetime. Because how could you plan the\
  \ best out of a place you've never been to?"
