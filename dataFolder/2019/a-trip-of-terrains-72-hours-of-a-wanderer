Text: "University has given me enough insanity with four months of constant bombardment\
  \ of tests, assignments and quizzes. As the end of the semester approached I looked\
  \ forward to a month of being at home again, having nothing to do as always. My\
  \ birthday was around the corner and mum asked me if I would like to throw a party\
  \ since it\u2019s my 21st. I rejected the idea instead telling her \u201CThe last\
  \ time I cut a cake was at 13,lets just go out and have dinner with dad ,that\u2019\
  s all I want\u201D. But what they presented me has truly been a blessing. A journey\
  \ which I consider a leap of an adventure into the world of backpacking. It was\
  \ after dinner at a fancy restaurant on the 15th of April mum and dad presented\
  \ me with a flight ticket and an itinerary that read out a 3 day plan to \u201C\
  Chiang Mai\u201D, I was even more shocked when they told me I was going alone. Now,\
  \ wherever we go, we always went out as a family, never once went on trips without\
  \ the supervision of my parents. I guessed I finally grew up. I boarded the plane\
  \ on a 6am flight to Chiang Mai on the 24th of April 2018, I felt nervous and excited\
  \ as I was about to go on a solo tour. A three hour flight to Northern Thailand\
  \ from \u201CKLIA\u201D and we landed at Chiang Mai International Airport at 9am.\
  \ I checked out, took my luggage and walked to the lobby area to be greeted warmly\
  \ by my tour guide, Amy. She escorted me to the tour van where I met an old Singaporean\
  \ couple who will be with us for the next four days. We started our journey by visiting\
  \ one of Chiang Mai\u2019s main attraction sites, \u201CWat Phra That Doi Suthep\u201D\
  , or simply known as Doi Suthep Temple. The temple was simply divine .I was blown\
  \ away with the Thai Buddhist traditions, stunning architecture and the hymns recited\
  \ by the monks that went \u201CItipiso Bhagawa Ara Sambuddha sambo\u201D,we sat\
  \ there as I closed my eyes letting those words seep through my consciousness, it\
  \ was an experience like no other. We then went on a city tour to visit other temples\
  \ and monumental sites. The main town sites were surrounded by Buddhist temples\
  \ and it was known for its amazing nightlife, which was just the cultural experience\
  \ I needed. Later that evening we had a traditional \u201CKhantoke\u201D dinner\
  \ accompanied by an amazing Lanna cultural performance. After dinner we then went\
  \ back to our respective hotels and had the rest of the night for ourselves. Uncle\
  \ and Aunty Alex wanted to head out for some night shopping , I accompanied them\
  \ , and we went to the famous Chiang Mai Night Bazaar ,where there were rows of\
  \ stalls and shops that stretched a kilometer long. From fake designer bags to traditional\
  \ oil paintings it had it all, the bazaar is a must visit for anyone who heads to\
  \ Chiang Mai. I bought paintings and souvenirs and we enjoyed the live music at\
  \ a nearby bar. We started off the next day with a 4 hour ride to Chiang Rai, a\
  \ city near the boarder of Myanmar and Laos. We visited the \u201CWhite Temple\u201D\
  \ and were given the option to have a day trip to Myanmar or Laos for a fee of \u201C\
  1500 Bhat\u201D.We chose Myanmar, giving us the opportunity to visit two countries\
  \ at once having, an extra stamp on our passports. We were bestowed upon an array\
  \ of amazing sceneries in Myanmar, with its architecture and culture being totally\
  \ different from Thailand\u2019s. We even tried to blend in with the culture there\
  \ by  applying on \u201CThanakas\u201D and wearing on \u201CLongyis\u201D and tried\
  \ some local delicacies. We headed back to Chiang Mai that night to rest. And headed\
  \ out for some last minute shopping and sightseeing the next morning. Amy then sent\
  \ us back to the airport, where we said our goodbyes and parted ways after a coffee\
  \ chat. With that I say the colors of culture and the serenity of nature left me\
  \ with only the sweetest of memories, a journey that changed me forever."
