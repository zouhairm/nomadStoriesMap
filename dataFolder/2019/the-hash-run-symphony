Text: "Once upon a setting Filipino sun, a small paradise of dirt-covered strangers\
  \ cracked open warm beers around a feast of spit-roasted pig. Dusty-foot travelers\
  \ from different walks of life had just raced each other through miles of mud in\
  \ stifling mountain rainforest. They sped past remote clusters of straw huts filled\
  \ with confused villagers clad in similar straw clothing. \n\nI wondered if I was\
  \ the first Westerner those children had ever seen as I raced my brothers through\
  \ their community, chasing the chalk trail markers around impenetrable vegetation.\
  \ Surely their curious faces mimicked those of their ancestors when the first Europeans\
  \ landed on these shores many hundreds of years ago. Is it possible that such an\
  \ interaction can still be had in the 21st century? \n\n\u201COH!\u201D\n\nA yak\u2019\
  s twisted horns nearly skewered my brother and me while we turned a corner of dense\
  \ foliage, missing me by inches and forcing him to spin-move into a thorn bush.\
  \ \n\nThe yak remained surprisingly unfazed, unlike the villagers. \n\n\u201CHash\
  \ runs\u201D are found in many corners of the globe. A peculiar race where one person,\
  \ the \u201Chare,\u201D runs for roughly 5 kilometers in any route he desires, throwing\
  \ down fistfuls of chalk to mark a path for the \u201Chounds.\u201D The next day,\
  \ hounds race into the unknown, tracking chalk breadcrumbs to the finish line where\
  \ the hare awaits with a banquet.\n\nWhen celebrating with strangers on a soft white-sand\
  \ beach at the edge of a jungle, facing the orange sun that blazed over the horizon,\
  \ excitement strikes. It\u2019s the lively feeling of youth\u2019s invincibility\
  \ combined with the inspiring realization that our vast world surely contains more\
  \ experiences like this. \n\nWanderlust swells.\n\nUnfamiliar languages filled the\
  \ evening BBQ air as my cut-up brother sat in the sand next to me with his clothes\
  \ still full of thorns. Our feet waded in the bathtub-warm surf, the crystal-clear\
  \ water teaming with tiny fish swimming along. \u201CWhere are Trip and Lara?\u201D\
  \ he asked, as we scanned the chattering crowd in hopes of spotting familiar faces.\
  \ We turned around and there they stood, alone along the seashell-strewn shoreline,\
  \ the fire-like sunset reflecting off of their gazing faces. In the distance behind\
  \ their heads, sea birds soared over an ancient Spanish castle that peaked out of\
  \ the jungle\u2019s thick trees and hanging vines; a relic from the time when cultures\
  \ first collided on these tropical shores. The curiosity of those early voyagers\
  \ can evidently still be felt today by anyone with a desire to stray from the beaten\
  \ path.\n\nIn a moment where your slow breaths synchronize with the gentle lapping\
  \ of waves on the shore, you notice the magnificence of adventure. A subtle symphony\
  \ of minor details composes our greatest memories."
