Text: "In January 2011, I decided to take a brief  holiday and that Dubai would be\
  \ the destination, I got  my visa , reservation then ticket ready and off to Dubai\
  \ I went.\nSuch a beautiful and well planned country and I enjoyed every bit of\
  \ my stay as it was rolling. The Burj Khalifah was a sight to behold and Dubai mall\
  \ is a place no one wants to leave after seeing The Aquarium, Mercury floor in it,\
  \ The Dancing Fountain is nothing short of amazing.\nMy Visa was for A 2week visit\
  \ though I planned to stay just 7days of it and get back home but the beauty of\
  \ this country was so overwhelming I decided to use the whole of the 2weeks given\
  \ by Immigration and that decision was on the 6th day, making it a day to my earlier\
  \ scheduled departure so I needed a sort of miracle to extend my ticket. I have\
  \ a friend in the UK who told me before coming about someone who could show me around\
  \ in Dubai but unfortunately He was not available within my first few days of getting\
  \ to United Arab Emirates.\nSame eve ,someone called and quoted He was from the\
  \ guy that was supposed to show me around and I told Him I was in no mood to go\
  \ out or see anywhere. My friends all said there was no way I would change a ticket\
  \ when its less than 24hours to departure and seriously I needed a solution. \n\
  I just thought to call the guy who came to pick me up and ask help, which I did\
  \ giving all details. Voila! In less than 5mins He reached out to me and gave me\
  \ details of how to change my ticket for only AED20 (20 Dirhams) , I couldn't be\
  \ happier at that little connect from someone who hardly knows me. It touched me\
  \ and I would be ever grateful of that gesture. Some one else might not even help\
  \ because I declined to hang out with him but He still went ahead to do that favour.\
  \ \nToday, my little connect then has gone to REST IN PEACE but I have never ceased\
  \ to forget that little kind gesture to a total stranger, every time I think UAE\
  \ it comes to mind and He comes to mind.\nI pray that His soul continues to rest\
  \ peacefully. \nThe remaining 7days of staying in United Arab Emirates afforded\
  \ me time to see more Emirates Ajman, Al Fujairah , more souks (market). Time to\
  \ do more shopping.\nIn all it was a wonderful and enjoyabld experience that I would\
  \ trade for nothing."
