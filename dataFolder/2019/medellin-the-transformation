Text: "\u201COne's life should have two goals. - First is to be happy. Second is to\
  \ help others\u201D - said Sergio, my free-walking-tour guide in Medellin. We were\
  \ in Communa trece (Neighborhood #13) in Medellin-Colombia, getting not just a tour\
  \ but a life lesson from the young Sergio. \n\nCommuna #13 used to be one of the\
  \ most dangerous neighbourhoods in the world (drugs, gangs, military, you name it!)\
  \ and now it's full of graffiti-art which, helped by Sergio\u2019s interpretations\
  \ and explanations, tells the story of its past tragedies and recent transformation.\
  \ Medellin\u2019s unique topology ( the \u201Cparapente\u201D ie.para-gliding tour\
  \ highly recommended for the view), flat area surrounded by hillsides on almost\
  \ all sides, had caused the folks in the hills to be marginalized without sanitation\
  \ or public transport. This then helped the drug lords to take over the hillsides\
  \ in the 19080\u2019s and, in the 1990\u2019s, led to the government sending in\
  \ military & helicopters to wipe out the drug mafia and in the process totally disrupting\
  \ normal life.\n\nThe subsequent story told by the graffiti and brought to life\
  \ by Sergio\u2019s descriptions showed how a new political outlook shaped by the\
  \ people\u2019s will started the process of integration - building libraries, outdoor\
  \ gyms and promoting hip-hop & graffiti as a form of youth-expression. Especially\
  \ creative was the solution to the challenge of integrating the populations on the\
  \ hillsides -   Medellin now is perhaps the only city in the world where gondola\
  \ like cable cars and outdoor escalators (many many floors of them) are part of\
  \ the city\u2019s metro system. The journey of improvement now continues driven\
  \ by young people like Sergio - he runs a non-profit providing English and computer\
  \ education to kids. Sergio is clearly passionate about this cause and asks us travellers\
  \ for ideas which we may have seen working in other parts of the world. \n\nColombia\
  \ - Dangerous !\u201D  \"Medellin - wasn\u2019t that Pablo Escobar\u2019s stronghold\
  \ ?\u201D - these were the reactions I had got from friends about my Colombia travel\
  \ plans. I am glad that I still made the trip to be fascinated to see the transformation\
  \ of Medellin - the walkable neighbourhood of Poblado teeming with digital nomads\
  \ and upscale coffee bars, numerous city parks with the bulbous statues by Botero,\
  \ the outdoor public gyms, in addition to the life-like graffiti telling so many\
  \ stories.\n\nMeeting people like Sergio has been the highlight of my backpacking\
  \ trip across Latin America. I took a sabbatical and started my trip at the ripe\
  \ young age of 40, with a bunch of self-doubts - will I enjoy staying in hostels\
  \ as a 40 year old, can I travel through Latin America  without speaking any Espanol\
  \ (Note: Espanol much improved no), will I meet people and make friends ? At the\
  \ end of my six-month trip - I can say that it is one\u2019s attitude that matters\
  \ most - if open to new experiences and people, incredible connections and travel\
  \ magic happens. The desire to help and a need for connection transcends language\
  \ and language barriers. \n\nThese are the kind of unexpected travel interactions\
  \ and connections that stick to my memory -  when I meet people, and get a new viewpoint\
  \ on what really makes people tick.  I continue my travels looking for more such\
  \ interactions to leave an indelible mark on my thinking. Meanwhile, Sergio is helping\
  \ others. He seems happy - Are you ?!"
