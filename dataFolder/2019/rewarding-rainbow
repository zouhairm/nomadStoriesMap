Text: "The alarm rings and awaken me at midnight, its hard to wake up when you only\
  \ sleep for 3 hours. At the same token my mind goes a minute a miles, this is the\
  \ trip I\u2019ve been waiting for the past 5 years. Visiting the Rainbow mountain\
  \ of Peru. Fransisco picked me up with a minibus and I happen to be the last pick\
  \ up and he told me to sit in the front seat next to him. We drive away from the\
  \ city of Cusco and driving on the side of the mountain edge. At first it wasnt\
  \ scary at all because the sun still a sleep. As we get higher on the mountain the\
  \ sunshine letting us see more clear that we are only a couple inches away from\
  \ the edge of the cliff. Fransisco notice the worry on my face I have and said \u201C\
  Dont worry I am a good driver, I drove four times a day here.\u201D And he slammed\
  \ the brake after that, woke up the rest of the group at the back of the minivan\
  \ \u201CSorry\u201D he said. \u201CAnother mini bus coming down the mountain, we\
  \ have to wait until they pass us.\u201D A very narrow road that was hardly paved\
  \ with asphalt is a two way road. Around the bend is the only wider road that fits\
  \ two minibuses but the driver has to work together and pass each other at the same\
  \ times for it to work. Passing herds of Alpacas and Llamas along the way and the\
  \ scenary of the beautiful mountains with water streams running through the valley\
  \ surrounded by cute baby alpacas roaming free chasing each other, is my first memory\
  \ of Alpacas and Llamas. We arrived in the middle of the rainbow mountain and the\
  \ journey continues on foots and horses. I experienced the altitude sickness, Fransisco\
  \ gave me Coca tea and some Coca candy, it didnt help much. He told me I will make\
  \ it to the top of the mountain with a help from Diablo the horse. I was glad I\
  \ had Diablo, he is a gentle horse and his owner Diego is very patient with him.\
  \ We stop a few times to let Diablo drink water from the streams. With the altitude\
  \ sickness this trip feels like a never ending trip. Diego leading Diablo to an\
  \ easier route, separating us from the rest of the group. The scenary we passed\
  \ was so beautiful and he said this is a secret view that he found last year. We\
  \ went around the bend and we saw the rest of the group way down the mountain. Diego\
  \ help me down from the horse and said he will be waiting here to get me down after\
  \ I am done climbing the mountain. As I am huffing and puffing trying to manage\
  \ my altitude sickness, climbing the mountain, a familiar face greets me, its Fransisco\
  \ the guide giving me some oxygen. And told me only a few more steps and it will\
  \ feel like I am in heaven. To witness the colorful Rainbow Mountain of Peru with\
  \ my own eyes was amazing. And I forget that I had altitude sick earlier. There\
  \ are mixed reviews about the colors of the mountain not being as bright at most\
  \ pictures and its been photoshoped. The way I see it is that the camera we use\
  \ is not as good as our own eyes that way most photgraphers filtered the picture\
  \ to make it as close as a personal view. I walk to the the higher side of the mountain\
  \ and i was able to capture the full length of the colorful side of the mountain,\
  \ take a few poses along the way. Looking down to what seems like a never ending\
  \ route back to the minibus was scary but I know that I have earned my rewards with\
  \ the scenary that Diego showed me and the rainbow color mountain, this reward will\
  \ last me a life time of the unknown journey ahead, tomorrow I will be going to\
  \ Ollantaytambo."
