Text: "The thing about traveling to the same city for a second time is that you can\
  \ either retrace your favorite routes, honoring a memory, or you can uncover a whole\
  \ new world that is just waiting to be found. Yet, sometimes, the buildings you\
  \ once knew seem entirely different, although they look the same. Because, sometimes,\
  \ you go to Jeonju. And, sometimes, you are brave enough to allow cities to change\
  \ you.\n\n   I had only been to Jeonju once before my sister and I decided to travel\
  \ to the city for a one-night trip. A boy I had recently met asked if I would like\
  \ to visit his hometown again while he was there. Julia was invited too, as she\
  \ would get to explore a bit more of South Korea before returning to Brazil. Okay,\
  \ I was going on a date. But I truly wanted her to have fun. We discussed details,\
  \ booked a one-room apartment near the Hanok Village and bought bus tickets. \n\n\
  \   We giggled like kids, feeling adventurous, as we got snacks from the impressive\
  \ amount of options available at a convenience store and headed to our seats. My\
  \ Korean was fairly reasonable. I could get some information when needed. Mostly\
  \ food-related, to be honest. Yes, I was concerned. I had never traveled by myself\
  \ inside Korea, I was going on a date with a charming guy and I was taking my sister.\
  \ My excitement, however, took over my fears when the bus lights were turned off\
  \ and we departed. \n\n   The Winter evening breeze played around with our hairs\
  \ and we received curious glances from other people waiting for a taxi. We were\
  \ the only foreigners in sight. Later I heard westerners tend to overlook Jeonju\
  \ when making an itinerary, therefore, we were an unusual sight to locals, especially\
  \ outside the touristic spots. In the taxi, I realized the local dialect was much\
  \ different from what I had learned before. Communication could\u2019ve gone better:\
  \ I had no way of explaining how to get to the address I showed. We compromised,\
  \ \u201Cleave us at the Hanok village, please\u201D. We dropped off in front of\
  \ a coffee shop, near a square.\n\n   I had only been inside the village and it\
  \ had been vibrating with people and sunlight.  Don\u2019t panic, I thought, wondering\
  \ how lost we were. As we moved around, trying to determine which direction google\
  \ was telling us to follow (awful right-left distinction skills), I saw it: the\
  \ Pungnammun gate. \nIt was, among the noiseless streets, stunningly beautiful.\
  \ Maybe the awareness it was late and the area was deserted amplified my senses,\
  \ but it felt as if I had been thrown in another world. A magical distant past I\
  \ could never touch; where I would never belong. Drawn as I was, my sister\u2019\
  s voice was but a whisper; the modern traces around us, a faint distraction. \n\n\
  \   Thanks to the GPS we concluded we had been left a few blocks away from our accommodation.\
  \ Both of us were vacillating between the sense of unknown danger, inherent to those\
  \ who are facing a new reality, and the amazement brought by the details of darkened\
  \ streets and the vague smells that danced through the cool air, as we crossed an\
  \ unfamiliar bridge under an unfamiliar sky. We fell silent, each of us lost in\
  \ our thoughts, walking by leafless trees and surrounded by thousands of years of\
  \ history.\n\n   On the following morning, another adventure began. My handsome\
  \ date met us for breakfast and took out the rest of the day to introduce us to\
  \ his favorite places. We drank makgeolli, rice wine, and had pajeon, a colorful\
  \ Korean pancake. This was quite a feature, as he had to persuade the restaurant\
  \ owner to cook it instead of a seafood pajeon,  since Julia is vegetarian. He won\
  \ my sister over after that. As for me, he had won me over right when we met. But\
  \ that is the story of a different city.\n\n   Looking back to that short adventure\
  \ \u2014 the very beginning of our journey \u2014, when we crossed the quiet streets\
  \ leading to a rooftop room on a hidden house, I wonder: did I know Jeonju had already\
  \ changed my life?"
