Text: "That's me, Portuguese but from Luxembourg and now currently living in Sydney,\
  \ Australia. I was born in Luxembourg, nobody knows this tiny  country I know but\
  \ my parents are Portuguese. I studied, graduated from university, bought a flat\
  \ and started working, had my own dream car, loved my job, and earned quite well,\
  \ started travelling to discover more than 30countries.. Blablabla a current normal\
  \ boring good life, well actually a very good cool lifestyle right? \nBut no, I\
  \ felt like there was something missing in my life. I always had this passion for\
  \ travelling and I always dreamed of Sydney and visiting Australia. So one day I\
  \ had a brilliant idea and I decided to book an one way ticket to Bangkok (where\
  \ I had never been before) So I quite my job, rent my flat and started travelling\
  \ alone through Asia! Since then, I have been to Thailand, Myanmar, Malaysia, Singapore,\
  \ Vietnam, Taiwan and now Australia. I me living my dreams and this is all I recommand\
  \ people to do! Life is too short to be stick to a 9-5hours every day shit. Have\
  \ you ever thought about what really makes you happy? Do you imagine living your\
  \ whole life working every single day? Well I don't and despite the people telling\
  \ me that I was crazy I took the best decision ever! Life is what you make out of\
  \ it! I have met so many people from travellers to locals and I have seen so many\
  \ amazing places, I ve been trhough so many adventures and I believe that this is\
  \ just the start of it! So if you ever have the opportunity to realise your dreams,\
  \ don't look back and don't let other people put you down! Life is what you make\
  \ of it!"
