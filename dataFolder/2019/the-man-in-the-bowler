Text: "A privileged man, indeed, was my great, great grandfather.  Who else would\
  \ take his children and wife on a world trip leaving Chicago via train in 1908,\
  \ visiting nearly twenty countries over eight months?  Even more privileged would\
  \ he have been to realize that - a hundred years later - his great, great grandson\
  \ would embark on that very same adventure.\n\nYou see, I decided to \u201Cretire\u201D\
  \ from my work in my thirties and retrace this historic trip.  A most earnest wandering\
  \ bird was I ever since my first days traveling with my brother for summer vacation.\
  \  My fascination was put to the test in 2008, when my great, great grandfather\u2019\
  s travel journal made its way to me upon my grandmother\u2019s passing.  I was captivated!\
  \ A century later, I was drawn to recreating his odyssey.  And so I flew to Chicago,\
  \ found my westbound train at Union Station, and embarked on the adventure of a\
  \ lifetime\u2026\n234 days later.\n\nThis 2008 journey provided the opportunity\
  \ to see and compare many cultures across the planet and how changes have transformed\
  \ over 100 years. Traveling by train, freighter, ferry, car, and eventually plane\
  \ (as strange a travel mode for my great, great grandfather as space travel is to\
  \ us), I was able to stop at every landmark cited in his journal, finding seven\
  \ hotels still in business, and enjoying many traditions that seemed unchanged from\
  \ 1908. With all the progress we have witnessed over the last century - air conditioning,\
  \ air travel, microwave dinners, etc - we are still a community that needs food\
  \ and shelter in our pursuit of happiness.   \n\nI visited the wonders of the world\
  \ from days past: places like the pyramids of Giza, the Taj Mahal, and the carved\
  \ rock city of Petra.  I visited newer landmarks such as ground zero at Nagasaki,\
  \ Hiroshima and in Manhattan, where the former World Trade towers once stood.  For\
  \ me, all were breathtaking.  \n\nI lived countless history lessons as I visited\
  \ countries like Israel, Jordan and Lebanon, which did not even exist in 1908 when\
  \ my ancestor made his epic journey.  The British gave independence to the exotic\
  \ countries of India and Hong Kong in the last century, yet I was able to benefit\
  \ from British influence by traveling comfortably in those countries without language\
  \ issues because of the prevalence of English.\n\nOf course, I had to adapt and\
  \ be flexible in order to manage the unexpected during this global journey.  The\
  \ new friends I met along the way reminded me of the best human nature has to offer.\
  \ I was able to share my experiences with friends and family, as well as feeling\
  \ life\u2019s joys and pains in faraway places.  Examples?  Hunger in Calcutta,\
  \ poverty in Damascus, awe at China\u2019s Great Wall and marvel at the bazaars\
  \ of Istanbul.  These represented serious consciousness-expanding experiences for\
  \ any explorer!\n\nOn day 221 of my voyage I was in London.  I stumbled across an\
  \ art gallery that happened to have the same name as my great, great grandfather.\
  \  The coincidence value was too high; I couldn\u2019t resist introducing myself\
  \ to the owner and telling him my story.  Later that evening, I exchanged information\
  \ with a lovely young lady whose accent I mistook for French. We kept in enthusiastic\
  \ touch for some time and have now been married for seven years.  Talk about the\
  \ best kind of trip memento.\n\nWe all go through the rollercoaster of life together;\
  \ it is the only way we can survive.  We all contribute what we can at opportune\
  \ moments and this journey around the globe across five generations of my family\
  \ shared in my journeys over the years. We all share in joy when we are able to\
  \ share a sliver of our life with a loved one, just as we share in the tragedies\
  \ in kind.  Through these ups and downs, we are connected in a special way through\
  \ travels and the different perspectives; slowly grow on us over the years.  Our\
  \ brotherhood allows us to enjoy the delights, help in the sorrows and move forward,\
  \ never to forget the situations where words need not be spoken."
