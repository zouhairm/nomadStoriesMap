Text: "Traveling to the Philippines last December was not a vacation but rather to\
  \ sell my mother's property after she died on April 2018. The property had been\
  \ rented but because we were American citizens residing in California and no property\
  \ management to handle the finances, the tenants have not paid rent for five years.\
  \ During her last visit in 2015, my mother demanded payment or they would be evicted.\
  \ Consequences of this demand brought us local Barangay (community) notices that\
  \ it is not that easy to evict tenants due to existing laws. Even with possible\
  \ litigation, the tenants' reply was just to burn the house down. No charges of\
  \ arson were filed. The house was near an existing gate in Korea-town of the newly\
  \ established Clark International Airport. Manila International Airport simply cannot\
  \ handle existing jet traffic.  Clark used to be an American Air Force base until\
  \ President Ferdinand Marcos became freindly with China and increasingly dissatisfied\
  \ with American Aid packages to benefit Imelda Marcos and her international cronies.\
  \  The eruption of Mt. Pinatubo sealed the hasty retreat of American forces in all\
  \ of the Philippines including Subic Bay, the largest USN port in Asia.\n     Currently\
  \ President Duterte in on a zero-tolerance vigilante crusade with drugs supported\
  \ by American President Donald Trump."
