Text: "Any tragedy with so much impact on the human race will leave a significant\
  \ mark on history. To me, Chernobyl is even more embedded in my memory.\_I remember\
  \ 1986 vividly. I was a typical teenager working in the restaurant industry, saving\
  \ money for college and travel. Gasoline was less than a dollar a gallon to fill\
  \ my old Volkswagen Beetle, Madonna was my favorite singer and could always be heard\
  \ on my cassette player. Oprah made her national debut that year, and Phantom Of\
  \ The Opera opened in London\u2019s West End. The public charity event \u201CHands\
  \ Across America\u201D was held in May of 1986. \nI had already developed an interest\
  \ for news, journalism, and travel, so the horrific story that unfolded that spring\
  \ from a faraway place has always been an indispensable part of my history.\nSeveral\
  \ major world events happened that year. You remember exactly where you were and\
  \ how you felt the moment they took place. For me, there were three such events.\
  \ The outbreak of Mad Cow Disease in England, The Space Shuttle Challenger tragedy\
  \ and the terrible explosion of the number four reactor at the Chernobyl Power Plant\
  \ in Ukraine, at the time still part of the Soviet Union. \nI can clearly remember\
  \ Peter Jennings reporting that little was known about the nuclear accident on ABC\u2019\
  s World News Tonight. After seeing that initial report, I remember being glued to\
  \ the T.V. for days waiting for the slow trickle of information. The Soviets weren\u2019\
  t known for releasing more information than necessary on these kinds of events but\
  \ may have been relatively quick to respond to this because evidence of nuclear\
  \ radiation had already reached beyond the Soviet borders into Scandinavia and Central\
  \ Europe.\_\nAt the time, Chernobyl was somewhat of a showcase facility with an\
  \ excellent safety record. It sat near the capital city of Kiev, with nearly three\
  \ million inhabitants, and about 1,000 miles from Scandinavia. Whatever happened\
  \ there lead to a radioactive cloud headed north over Poland, to Denmark, Finland,\
  \ Norway, and Sweden. It would turn out to be the most severe accident to ever take\
  \ place in the short history of civil nuclear power. \nLittle news was being released\
  \ initially from Chernobyl, even to the leaders in Moscow. In an interview years\
  \ later, Gorbachev himself said he was first alerted of the severity of the accident\
  \ from Sweden. The radioactive fallout would eventually be many times greater than\
  \ the combined power of the two bombs dropped on Japan in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\
  My intrigue with the accident in Chernobyl has stayed with me over the years. In\
  \ 1997, while on a photojournalism internship in Budapest, Hungary, I began to make\
  \ plans to go to Ukraine to document how life was there at that time. Due to time\
  \ constants, I never made it. The newsreels and still images I\u2019d seen from\
  \ the accident were somehow strategically placed in the back of my mind, categorized\
  \ there for some kind of future use. \nI wasn\u2019t sure when or how it would all\
  \ come in handy, but I had a connection to the story, and if nothing else, I wanted\
  \ to remember it all.\nThis year, I received an email from Maxx Kochar, the program\
  \ manager from Photographers Without Borders. He had a special request just for\
  \ me, to see if I was interested in going to Ukraine to cover the story of the NGO\
  \ Clean Futures Fund, which helps local communities in and around Chernobyl affected\
  \ by the accident. It took me about two seconds to hit the \u201Creply all\u201D\
  \ button on my Gmail account with the simple word \u201CYES\u201D!\n I was on my\
  \ way, representing PWB to cover all of the heroic things CFF is working on at Chernobyl,\
  \ in Pripyat (the city built for the workers of the power plant), in Slavutych (a\
  \ similar city built for the workers of the plant after the accident), local healthcare\
  \ for those workers and the liquidators and their families, local orphanages, rehabilitation\
  \ centers, and their \u201CDogs of Chernobyl\u201D project.\nContinue Reading on\
