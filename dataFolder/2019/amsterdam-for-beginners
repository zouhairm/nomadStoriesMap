Text: "First of all, i live in Uzbekistan. This country located in the Central Asian\
  \ region. Uzbekistan is post soviet country, so the country looks like any other\
  \ from CIS. We do not have especially outstanding things, we just live in a country\
  \ where much is prohibited, there is censorship and lack of money. So i decided\
  \ to see a world outside of Uzbekistan. Firstly, i accumulated some amount of money\
  \ and visited Russia. It is a wonderful place but my story not about this. Then\
  \ i returned to my homeland and understood that is not enough for me. I worked for\
  \ 6 month in local press to get some money for next travel. I worked to the bone\
  \ to see Europe. I worked in holidays and even at my birthday. After ammasing up\
  \ the right amount I decided it was time to buy tickets to Europe. \nFor the sake\
  \ of understanding, my salary was 300 dollars a month, 200 of them I put off for\
  \ tickets and so on. I booked the cheapes hostel in Brusselss and Amsterdam. The\
  \ total duration of my trip was 8 days. During this time I wanted to go around Brussels\
  \ and Amsterdam. I could go to Paris, but it was too expensive for me. There were\
  \ no direct flights to Brussels from Uzbekistan, so I had to fly to Paris, and from\
  \ there go by train to Brussels. I remember the first time I left Charles de Gaulle\
  \ airport. It was another world to me. The streets even smelled differently. I saw\
  \ happy people walking with big glasses of coffee. For the first time I saw a busy\
  \ European metropolis. To be honest, Belgium wasn't interesting for me, but the\
  \ Netherlands struck me, which is why I will tell you about the experience of my\
  \ stay in this country. \nI remember the first time I got off the bus at the central\
  \ station. Before I reached my hostel, I felt a smell unknown to me all the way.\
  \ I could not understand what the smell was. But soon remembered that it was Amsterdam,\
  \ so I figured out that it was the smell of marijuana. However, you should not go\
  \ there if you want only to smoke weed. The people of Amtserdam have great architecture,\
  \ they should be proud of it. Also, there is a distinctive culture that really deserves\
  \ attention. After I got a little familiar with the city, I decided to learn about\
  \ the nightlife in Europe. I always went on foot, and decided to look at the red\
  \ light district, which is located around the old church (oude kerk). In addition\
  \ to prostitutes, I met nice people there, mostly students, I was pleased to see\
  \ a free city with strong personalities who are not ashamed to be who they are.\
  \ Another impression was the visit to the Rijksmuseum. I saw something incredible\
  \ inside. There were original paintings by Rembrandt, Van Gogh and others. It was\
  \ amazing to see all this cultural differencef between us. Usually, after a long\
  \ walk, I went to some cafe nearby, in Amsterdam you can find any kind of cuisine\
  \ that will delight every day. By the way, instead of cars in Amsterdam, bicycles.\
  \ They everywhere. Unlike Uzbekistan, where everyone wants to buy a car. In this\
  \ city, people do not care about their financial situation, as they simply try to\
  \ live happily. They formed their own rules of movement. Traffic jams from bicycles,\
  \ special sphetophores for them and so on.\n\nFinally i was sorry to leave. I will\
  \ definitely go back there again. It was an incredible experience of my first trip\
  \ to Europe."
