Text: "It really was; paradise. The sweet aroma of freshly cut fruit filled the air\
  \ as it arrived at our table, alongside an array of other beautifully presented\
  \ dishes. Being up amongst the monkeys and extraordinary Asian wildlife, it was\
  \ a hotel environment I\u2019d never experienced before. Just last week a friend\
  \ and I had been sitting on our rocklike bunkbeds discussing passionately our love\
  \ for the country. We were staying in a hostel, it was clean, and the food was delicious,\
  \ but nothing quite like the \u2018Green Hill Paradise\u2019. \n\nAs we stared out\
  \ into the distance the sounds of the forest became almost songlike. My love for\
  \ animals had always been apparent, and so the atmosphere was nothing but bliss.\
  \ That day we made our way down to the local town, the hustle and bustle of the\
  \ streets made the experience all the more worthy. Suddenly, the clouds burst open\
  \ and rain started pouring from the heavens, so we decided to take shelter in this\
  \ charming little restaurant over-looking the sea. The wind was howling, and we\
  \ were soaked through, but a kind gentleman sitting just across the room from us\
  \ assured us that the rain was almost always short-lived. We sunk our heads into\
  \ the menu; there was so much choice, from smoothies to curries and even specialty\
  \ dishes, the list went on. We decided to go for a prawn coconut curry which was\
  \ said to be one of the country\u2019s finest dishes. As we tucked in, the rain\
  \ started to ease and my friend and I agreed that once we had settled the bill,\
  \ it was time to go for a surf.\n\nWe had never surfed before, the above made it\
  \ sound like we had; let\u2019s just say...we were keen! As we approached the warm,\
  \ sunny beach, a couple dozen men had already approached us; \u201CTuk-tuk!?\u201D\
  \ \u201CVery cheap price!\u201D. We kindly refused and moved closer to the beach\
  \ where many men were stood looking keener than ever to sell us their goods. Finally,\
  \ we came across a kind looking man who, after checking his books, agreed that he\
  \ would be able to fit us in for a two-hour slot of surfing almost immediately.\
  \ By this point it had been about a half hour since we\u2019d eaten, we needed to\
  \ wait another half hour to be certain we wouldn\u2019t catch a stitch! He agreed;\
  \ with that, we fell to the floor, taking our belongings down with us with one great\
  \ thump! The air was filled with salty water, I could almost taste it on my ton\u2026\
  \ \n\n\u201CWOAH, WHat time is it?\u201D. \u201CExcuse me, madam, did you still\
  \ want that surfing lesson?\u201D. We had fallen asleep; typical. We replied, with\
  \ a tired look in our eye, drank some water and traveled the short distance to the\
  \ hut where we dressed and paid. The sea was a perfect blue hue, the waves were\
  \ high, and the atmosphere calm. Dressed and paid, we made our way down to the seafront.\
  \ Our toes touched the water\u2019s edge, and with a huge wave of adrenaline I pushed\
  \ myself out into the deep, blue sea. Lola, my friend, had gone a bit too far out\
  \ for my liking. I looked back at the instructor in a worried cry, but he wasn\u2019\
  t looking. LOLA; LOLA, you OK out there!?\u201D. She looked scared. I jumped off\
  \ my board and swam fiercely to her side. Those professional swimming lessons finally\
  \ came in handy, I guess. \u201CLola, I was worried sick! I think we best finish\
  \ up there\u201D. Water fell out of her nose and mouth, as she uttered the words\
  \ \u201CYes, I think you\u2019re right\u201D. \n\nAs we sat on our comfy beds that\
  \ evening, I hugged Lola. \u201CI\u2019m so glad you\u2019re safe, you had me worried\
  \ sick\u201D. We had been best friends since infant school, and I knew we would\
  \ be friends for life. That night, we had dinner overlooking the same patch of water\
  \ where Lola nearly drowned. \u201CI think that\u2019s enough surfing for this holiday\u201D\
  , Lola turned to me with a laugh that fell just under her breath; \u201CYes, I think\
  \ you\u2019re right\u201D."
