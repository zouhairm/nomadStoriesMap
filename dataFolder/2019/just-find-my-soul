Text: "When I made this trip sometimes I heared music , while life passing by the\
  \ window of the car , my guide was so religious and sometimes feelme borring, my\
  \ boss always with mad mood , I am an opera singer but sometimes I worked as a freelance\
  \ of photographer , I hearing a song of Guns and roses \n\" Do you need some time\
  \ on your own\nDo you need some time all alone\nEverybody needs some time\nOn their\
  \ own\nDo not you know you need some time all alone\nI need some time all alone\
  \ \"\nNovember Rain is one of my favorite songs and  in  these  days the chorus\
  \ made sense in my visit to Darien, in a week I felt that I had matured more than\
  \ in thirty-three years of life, it is true that we all need moments alone to reconnect\
  \ with ourselves , to return to believe in the little things, in those that we stop\
  \ valuing. In this moment I asked my self what I do here?\nThe jungle could be a\
  \ Paradise for the one who has water and is safe, for others jungle is a hell a\
  \ terrible green tumb, with snakes and jaguars\nDarien is an area little exploited\
  \ touristic of Panama by the few roads that exist and because here you can\n see\
  \ migrants coming from distant lands like Congo, Bangladesh, Venezuela or Cuba,\
  \ with thirst and torn shoes is one of the strongest experiences I have ever lived,\
  \ however, it has taught me to value all those little things, and now I say thank\
  \ you because I live in a country in peace, thanks for having a smart phone, a laptop,\
  \ thank you   for  my  parents  ,  my  sister , my brother  , I'm  so  happy  because\
  \  I  have  a  family, thank  you because I can give my opinion with freedom, I\
  \ wanted to hold them and said all will be ok, how brave you are , don't give up.\n\
  But I was in a car looking forma tucans for take pictures I felt me stupid and so\
  \ frail\nIt is difficult to integrate a million pieces  of oneself, as if our western\
  \ world were a deceit full of ambition and models of perfection that are never achieved,\
  \ neither on a diet, nor being successful in a profession, nor being kind or gentle,\
  \  because  the  only one  perfection  that  realy  exist  is  the  nature .\nI\
  \ became friend with a little Titi monkey that I called\" Filipo\", he went to the\
  \ feeders and he offered me a couple of times the fruit he was eating in those little\
  \ details we can learn what unconditional friendship implies ,  real  love  really\
  \  exist .\nThen I visit to an Embera village  whose  name  is  \"  nueva  Vigia\
  \ \"  , it has been one of the most emotional moments of my life, to be in front\
  \ of people who have a worldview far from my western vision of the  society, to\
  \ feel one with them, beyond all prejudices and of all the borders that human beings\
  \ can invent in our heads ,  we  are  only  humans  without race , colors  of  skin\
  \ \n I found my soul in  the  middle  of  the  jungle"
