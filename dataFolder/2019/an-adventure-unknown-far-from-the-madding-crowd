Text: "My coaching starts at seven in the evening. And, to be there on time, I ought\
  \ to leave my home latest by six fifty. That day it was drizzling, and hence, my\
  \ father advised to put on the raincoat. When I was ready to leave, it has already\
  \ struck seven. It was evident now that I would reach at the coaching fairly late,\
  \ and late enough to miss first ten minutes of the lecture. Thus, as I pedalled,\
  \ midway to the coaching center, I thought of exploring the vicinity. It was raining\
  \ intermittently, and currently, there was no rain. It occurred to me that I should\
  \ take off the raincoat, lest I could appear strange. It however didn\u2019t seem\
  \ peculiar to me- wearing a raincoat on a rainy day (although it might not be raining\
  \ presently). Hence, I pedalled further, along the road.\n\nAfter I crossed the\
  \ building of my coaching class, I pedalled over the flyover, then down to a newer\
  \ world- a world I was familiar with, but not expected at this place. The place\
  \ seemed to be some rural area. The houses were not built firmly, their infrastructure\
  \ seemed impermanent. The rain has imparted a rather swampy look to the landscape\
  \ of that locality. The only road which connected this place with rest of the city\
  \ was miserable as well. Some parts of it were missing, and some other- cracked.\
  \ There in front of a house, the night meal was being cooked on the earthen stove.\
  \ As I advanced further, I was quite sure that it was some village. There were no\
  \ shops, except for a couple of medical stores. Due to the damage done by rain and\
  \ the darkening sky, the place resembled (to me) some sort of zombie land. An unique\
  \ smell was swept in the air. I couldn\u2019t quite recognize it. A fear gripped\
  \ me abruptly- what if some accident occurred, like my bicycle gets punctured and\
  \ I see someone with reversed feet, paper-white skin, nose missing, two holes at\
  \ the place of eyes and translucent body. What would I do then? There was no person\
  \ who I was familiar with. For a moment I got quite petrified. I observed the folks\
  \ around. They were all cheerful faces absorbed in their activities. This relieved\
  \ me, and I moved on.\n\nFor some reason or the other, the place reminded me of\
  \ my own village. I pedalled along the feeble road, perceiving the life of this\
  \ wonderland. Now the houses disappeared and were replaced by agricultural fields\
  \ on either side of the road- green fields all over the view. The night, however,\
  \ concealed the hue of the bushes. I knew nonetheless, they were green. This moment\
  \ was captivating. I was away from the city- the crowd- the honking vehicles- and\
  \ the robotic people in eternal rush of reaching nowhere. This moment was all about\
  \ me and the nature, nothing else. I wished this particular moment to last forever.\n\
  \nI continued my exploration along the road, which was seemingly unending. It was\
  \ gifted with a number of scenic beauties on both sides- the village life, the wilderness,\
  \ the agricultural fields, and most prominently- the nonpareil solitude. That night\
  \ I experienced unputdownable ecstasy.\n\nEventually, I decided to return as the\
  \ duration of my coaching class was one hour only. Hence it was prudent to reach\
  \ home on time. Taking in the perceptions of this (adventure) trip, I returned home.\
  \ On my way back, I had a glimpsed view of the place. The joy was inevitable.\n\n\
  When I was back in the city, it took fair amount of time for me to realize that\
  \ I was back to my routine life. I should say that the trip, or rather, the adventure\
  \ of that night took me away from the miseries of life, although transiently but\
  \ effectively, indeed.\n\nFar from the crowd, this was an adventure, which was unknown."
