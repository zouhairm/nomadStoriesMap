Text: "the sound of crashing waves awakes me from my day dreaming. the sun is shining\
  \ so hot, even though i could feel cool breeze blowing towards me, give my skin\
  \ cool sensation in hot air like this. i look ahead, blink my eyes couple time,\
  \ still don't see the end of the beach. one of the reason why i like this beach,\
  \ i can walk and day dreaming at the same time without have to stop because the\
  \ beach is so long.\n\ni look around, beach seems so quiet this afternoon, i can\
  \ see some foreigner sunbathe on beach chairs, but other than that, there is no\
  \ activity insight. maybe because it's still noon. it still two more hours until\
  \ sunset, where the beach is usually cramped with people doing various activity\
  \ such as play volley ball, soccer ball, dog walking, taking pictures, or doing\
  \ videos.\n\ni take a deep breath, inhale the smell of the ocean. while i'm standing\
  \ there, playing with waves foam, debating with myself to swim or not, a local woman\
  \ called me from a far, \"miss, bracelet miss. necklace?\" i turned to her, and\
  \ shake my head slowly, a sign that i don't want to buy anything. i continue my\
  \ walk along the shoreline.\n\nsince i started walking, three women sellers like\
  \ her, approached me already, offering their wares. it's accessories made by local\
  \ arts like necklaces, bracelets, or anklets. those accessories actually pretty\
  \ nice, but the price usually has big difference with what you found in the store.\
  \ it's common to find same things with higher price on the beach rather than in\
  \ the store. however, this woman seller seems determined not to take no for an answer.\
  \ she carried a basin above her head and a big bundle on her back, walking towards\
  \ me. \n\n \"miss, necklace miss.\" she called me as she walk closer. i turned my\
  \ head, and shaked my head politely. after two steps, she called me again, \"miss,\
  \ braid hair. do you want braid hair? dream catcher?\"\n\n\"no, sorry.\" by the\
  \ time i said that, she is already besides me.\n\n\"what do you want miss? bracelet?\
  \ leg bracelet, yes?\" she shows me her arm, which full of variety of necklaces\
  \ and bracelets, i'm not really sure. i shake my head again and her expression started\
  \ to change.\n\n\"bracelet miss? for leg? just buy one and i promise not disturb\
  \ you again. you've been disturb so many times, yes?\" she said with her broken\
  \ english, her tone almost begging.\n\n\"what? seriously?\" i am intrigue. i have\
  \ been here three days and there's always local women like her disturb my walk.\
  \ \n\nshe nods, \"if you buy this, no one will ask you again. promise.\" then she\
  \ explained why there are so many women like her disturb me, apparently, it's because\
  \ i don't wear any, so they know that i am a tourist. that's why they always approached\
  \ me, she said. \n\na minute later, i was busy choosing anklets while she ask me\
  \ where i come from. when i told her i'm from australia, she was surprised and told\
  \ me that i have indonesian's skin. she thought i was from finland, if it's not\
  \ indonesian. i told her that my grandma and my mom is indonesian, that's why i\
  \ have this skin color. i smiled and pay for my anklet, i choose the blue one, my\
  \ favorit color. after she left, i continued my walk with small smile on my face.\n\
  \ni am actually a local tourist. i am indonesian, but after spend few days in bali,\
  \ walking on the beach everyday, my skin got darker. while many indonesian would\
  \ complain about it, i couldn't more hapier with this changes. i come to bali with\
  \ one objectives; to take a break from bustle in Jakarta. that's why i travel alone\
  \ and pretend that i can't speak indonesian, because i want to go somewhere that\
  \ nobody knows my name. somewhere, where i can be whoever i want to be. that incident\
  \ just prove, that with my darker skin, i can blend in perfectly."
