Text: "As I sit upon the Luna Pyramid in Teotihuacan, something released and my wings\
  \ grew in permanently. The air was warm, the tourists had dispersed, the sun setting\
  \ beyond the endless horizon and I was alone. I was alone except for a hawk in the\
  \ sky that kept circling. Riding the currents of air nature has provided for it\
  \ to do so. A silhouette against the sun that brought Icarus to mind and a beatiful\
  \ creature calling my name in rotation. The view from left to right complimented\
  \ with a four foot wing span that left my camera at my side for fear of losing such\
  \ a meaningful moment in my life. To observe and take in, not spectate and lose\
  \ the message before me. I wrote a side note. \u201CThe energy released every desire\
  \ from me, An infinite supply of nature\u2019s well being, To take from the earth,\
  \ without consent, I pity the day that we have to repent, We\u2019ll feel the flames\
  \ unless we fix\nThe mindless intrusion to coexist,\nAnd not just us, the bloodline\
  \ is real\nIt\u2019s seeped into the earth, and provided our meals, If you cannot\
  \ grasp and let go of the past, The knives will remain, the pain will last, As you\
  \ get deeper make peace with thyself Embrace your fears, in your hands they melt,\
  \ Now you are free to know and to be, Hawk circles again, adopt the life of tree,\n\
  It starts at the roots and slowly you\u2019ll grow\nYou\u2019ll feel the cold, the\
  \ rain, the snow,\nFor it is the elements, so simple to touch\nYet you have forgotten\
  \ to love so much.\u201D This was a departure from thy former self. The hawk flew\
  \ away as it was getting darker. The stars were like stained glass backlit with\
  \ candle light. The line of site and the eerie silence taught me a lesson. I was\
  \ alone. I missed the hawk in my presence and a realization that if beneficial change\
  \ is to take place, does logic not demand that we all be a part of it in this world.\
  \ We can\u2019t change the past or foresee the future but If you think about it,\
  \ life is an astonishing journey. As I look up, there\u2019s one that begins and\
  \ ends in the sea of stars. While on the road, sooner or later all travelers who\
  \ endlessly chase the film photographs of their dreams must eventually drift off\
  \ into an eternal sleep. Old lives are ended, New lives are begun, and running through\
  \ it all, is a rocket a special rocket carrying upon for eternity. The dreams, hopes,\
  \ ambitions, and the youth of all humanity. Now, the flames of the Phoenix signal\
  \ that the journey of another youth about to begin. I realized that \u201CYou\u2019\
  re never too old until your regrets take the place of your dreams\u201D- @VascoNacho\n\
  \nThank You for your time"
