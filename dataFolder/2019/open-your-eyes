Text: "Rocking back and forth on the tipsy house boat I can feel my stomach twisting.\
  \ This is my first experience on a boat in the middle of the great blue ocean. The\
  \ teachers declare this will be our first chance of relaxation and rejuvenation.\
  \ After travelling throughout Asia and Australia for the last month and a half,\
  \ I am anticipating relaxing in a chair on the top deck and watching the sun slowly\
  \ collapse into the ocean. \n\n\tThen I hear a booming announcement over the speakers,\
  \ \u201Cit\u2019s time to go snorkelling!\u201D My heart starts racing at the thought\
  \ of dipping my toes into the icy water. Although I am reluctant, all of my classmates\
  \ follow as if this activity is required. I\u2019ve seen the Great Barrier Reef\
  \ in pictures, I\u2019ve seen videos of the coral structures and fish. I was looking\
  \ forward to seeing them in real life, but now I wish nothing more but to sit and\
  \ take in the crisp ocean air. \n\n\tI finally pull my stiff body out of the chair\
  \ and go down to the diving deck where I would jump into the ice pool. I put my\
  \ already-soaked body suit on and feel shivers go up my spine. Followed by the used\
  \ snorkelling mask and flippers. I have doubts. Do I really want to spend my relaxing\
  \ time in such cold water? Then I lurch myself forward and jump into the abyss.\
  \ A wave of warmth washes over me. It\u2019s not at all what I was dreading. My\
  \ legs propel me outwards to the coral reef. I finally stick my face into the blue\
  \ water and open my eyes to see, in all directions, fish swarming me. They flooded\
  \ the ocean fearlessly with their colours and entrance me in a state of euphoria.\n\
  \n\tI take a deep breath and swim downward to see the fish up close. I pass by the\
  \ coral and giant clams. The sea life buzzing all around, and I am slowly passing\
  \ by. I pop my head back out of the water and I accidentally inhale some salty sea\
  \ water. I float in the midst of the ocean choking on the salty flavour, and a sudden\
  \ jolt of cold hits me once again. I calm myself and duck my head back towards the\
  \ new world below me. Unicorn fish appear from what seemed to be nowhere, and their\
  \ horns shine from the reflection of the sun. I keep swimming forward getting lost\
  \ in their world. A cloud of blue parrotfish appears from the abyss and fill the\
  \ atmosphere with joy. This wasn\u2019t like the pictures I had seen in travel magazines.\
  \ Nor was it like the shows on TV. It was breathtaking. \n\n\tSuddenly I realize\
  \ what the cold shocks were coming from. Little clear jelly fish were stingy right\
  \ through my body suit. I am exhausted from accidentally swallowing so much water\
  \ and the coldness creeping up my spine. I decide it\u2019s time for me to retreat\
  \ back to the oasis on board. As I say goodbye to the Great Barrier Reef, I swim\
  \ away from the beauty. The reef morphs back to sand and darkness below me and I\
  \ know I am only moments from the boat. Then, out of the abyss, the most incredible\
  \ sight arose. A sea turtle delicately emerges and swims toward me. I take a deep\
  \ breath and follow it downward, swimming alongside, and I begin to feel one with\
  \ the ocean. I feel like I actually belong. \n\n\tThe turtle was a sign of hope,\
  \ and although the ocean tested my willpower, the sea creatures drew me near. I\
  \ swam back out to the beautiful reef and saw more than I had seen before. I snorkelled\
  \ until it was time to return, and as I climbed back onto the boat I promised myself\
  \ I would see the ocean once again. I dreamt that night of the experience: that\
  \ moment when time stood still, and the turtle arose. Bright and early I awoke at\
  \ five, and my body yearned to jump into the deep-sea once again."
