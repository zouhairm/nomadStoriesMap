Text: "There is a time when I need to escape from the toxic environment. Traveling\
  \ somewhere and telling no one. I just want to travel alone. I don't really care\
  \ where I'm going. Go wherever it is, the important thing is that no one knows where\
  \ I will go. So even with my family. Once I remember what Kafka said, that people\
  \ were just ruin everything. Sometimes it could be a dangerous thing that I do,\
  \ especially when I choose travel to dangerous place, vulcanic mountain, Krakatoa.\
  \ All that I need is treat my soul well and enjoying being solitude.\n\nI have to\
  \ cross the Sunda Strait from Canti Port, South Lampung to go to Krakatoa. The journey\
  \ take about one and half hours. During that time, I could only sit and not do anything\
  \ and look at the scenery, which was actually not too interesting. I chose to sit\
  \ on the top of the boat to attend the sound of the engine. The intense sunlight\
  \ burn my skin and the wave swing the boat. I am in the midst of the sea and just\
  \ can see a blue expanse of the sea and sometimes met a creepy little uninahbited\
  \ island. I didn\u2019t hear anything except the sound of distinct conversation\
  \ from other passenger from this boat and the sound of the boat\u2019s engine. In\
  \ the other time, I hear the sound of the water rolling then the waves breaking.\
  \ Actually, I found calm in the midst of the silence of the sea.\n\nThe solitude\
  \ that I have and the nature\u2019s sound from Sunda Strait bring me to the tragedy\
  \ almost two century ago. Mount Krakatoa explosion on August 26th, 1883 became big\
  \ explosion ever happen in the century. Right on that date, Mount Krakatoa erupted\
  \ and released an incandescent lava that fell into the ocean which I am now crossing.\
  \ As a result of its massive eruption, the world is darkened by volcanic ash. Meanwhile,\
  \ residents living on the small island around Krakatoa have no hope of living. Hot\
  \ clouds and large tsunamis killed more than 36 thousand people. The tragedy, probably\
  \ will repeat again between 2 and 3 centuries after the 1883 eruption occurred.\
  \ Today, Mount Krakatoa and Sunda Strait may be preparing to go back to history.\n\
  \ \nThe boat slowly pulled over to a dock. I arrived in Sebesi Island to take a\
  \ lunch before goes to Krakatoa. Some people bring drinks and lunch boxes to the\
  \ boat. On the coast of the residents' stalls began to be occupied by several tourists.\
  \ This island is a witness to the god and the bad things of Krakatoa. After the\
  \ eruption of Krakatoa, the island was abandoned and only became a dead island inhabited\
  \ by bodies of victims of hot clouds and tsunamis. The last few years, this island\
  \ began to be inhabited and used as a transit place for tourists who want to visit\
  \ Krakatoa.\n \nMaybe, Krakatoa wants to teach something to humans. Sometimes, we\
  \ can stay and explore benefits from something. However, there are times when we\
  \ have to go and leave that things, if it only gives a bad influence for us and\
  \ can kill us."
