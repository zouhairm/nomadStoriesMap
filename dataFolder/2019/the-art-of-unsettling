Text: "Excerpt - The Art of Unsettling:\n\nMy heartbreak wasn\u2019t a typical one.\
  \ I didn\u2019t just come out of a relationship. I didn\u2019t just get dumped or\
  \ rejected or cheated on. In fact, my heartbreak wasn\u2019t about another human,\
  \ it was about a place.\n\nOn December 5, 2018 I flew back to Boston from Edinburgh.\
  \ In 2017, for my 30th birthday, I decided that every year forward \u2013 especially\
  \ while I\u2019m single \u2013 I was going to treat myself to a trip. For my 30th\
  \ I went to Amsterdam to visit a friend from high school who lives there. For my\
  \ 31st, I went back to Edinburgh, which had stolen my heart just a brief 2 years\
  \ prior.\n\nLeaving Amsterdam in 2017 was hard because I left behind my partner\
  \ at the time, who had traveled from England to see me, and I wasn\u2019t sure when\
  \ I would get to see him next. So, it was understandable why I was upset on the\
  \ plane, with random bouts of tears streaming down my face while everyone around\
  \ me slept.\n\nLeaving Edinburgh this year was different. I was coming home to Boston\
  \ \u2013 a city I loved dearly and worked so hard to get to, but a city nonetheless\
  \ that I swear to God has been trying to break me since I moved to it. The honeymoon\
  \ phase between Boston and I faded in a few months and I realized just how completely\
  \ on my own I was \u2013 no one cared to be your friend, and it felt damn near impossible\
  \ to find your tribe. (Not as hard as it was in Providence, but that\u2019s another\
  \ story for another page). I was also coming home to a job that I thought was my\
  \ dream job, but in true Boston fashion that job didn\u2019t want me either and\
  \ basically told me my entire hire had been an \u201Coversight\u201D (don\u2019\
  t worry, I didn\u2019t need my ego anyway).\n\nI was leaving a city that welcomed\
  \ me with open arms, whose people are so kind and lovely, whose culture makes sense\
  \ to me, a country whose history resonates with me in unexpected ways, and whose\
  \ whole entire way of being just feels right. The only things in Boston that felt\
  \ right to come home to were my dog and cat. My job wasn\u2019t a sure thing, and\
  \ now neither was my entire foundation.\n\n\n\n\nThat lead me to this. The idea\
  \ of unsettling. I began to think about what brought me to where I was \u2013 a\
  \ career in social work where I could never quite get to where I wanted. An apartment\
  \ on the most perfect street in Boston that secretly struggles with cockroaches\
  \ and other critters that have way more legs than necessary. The empty feeling of\
  \ not being married with kids even though I don\u2019t even know if I want kids\
  \ at this point anymore.\n\nWhose ideals had I been trying to live up to my whole\
  \ life? Was this the life I wanted or the life I felt I needed to feel fulfilled?\
  \ Had I just been following this path laid out for me and blindly meeting goals\
  \ that weren\u2019t completely mine?\n\nSo I chose to unsettle. When met with the\
  \ choice of staying at a job that blatantly told me they didn\u2019t want me (and\
  \ if I chose to stay they would have me spend all of my time outside of work in\
  \ training and development for the job and expect me to stay on for another 1-2\
  \ years) or choosing to be terminated, I chose termination. I chose not knowing\
  \ when my next paycheck would ever come. I chose going back to waitressing and taking\
  \ a chance on becoming a real estate agent. None of which is sure money. None of\
  \ which provides me with health insurance, 401K, or takes taxes out of my income.\n\
  \nI chose to create my own meaning to life, my own meaning to a word that has an\
  \ otherwise negative connotation to it (unsettling) and pioneer ahead. Because living\
  \ up to other people\u2019s ideals and dreams doesn\u2019t get you anywhere but\
  \ settling for something you might not even have wanted in the first place. And\
  \ for that reason, I\u2019d rather be unsettled."
