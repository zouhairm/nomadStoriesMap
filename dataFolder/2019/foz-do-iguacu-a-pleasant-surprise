Text: "In 2016, my parents completed 50 years of marriage and my mother bought an\
  \ excursion to Foz do Igua\xE7u, in the State of Paran\xE1, border between Brazil,\
  \ Argentina and Paraguay, to commemorate this special date. But my father, God knows\
  \ why, did not want to go. So I had to make the sacrifice of accompanying my mother\
  \ on this trip. I have never planned to visit this region of the country and knew\
  \ practically nothing about it. As far as I knew, the only really interesting attraction\
  \ would be the Igua\xE7u Falls.\nIf this were the only tourist spot, however, I\
  \ would have far exceeded my expectations. There are no words to describe the feeling\
  \ of being close to such a waterfall. But the city has more to offer. The Igua\xE7\
  u National Park itself is surprising for the organization and infrastructure it\
  \ offers to visitors. In addition, on the same avenue that leads to the Falls, there\
  \ is the \"Parque das Aves\", an institution that unites conservation, tourism and\
  \ environmental education in a way that I had never seen before. It is exceptional!\
  \ We were all amazed.\nAnother attraction that should not be overlooked is the \"\
  Macuco Safari\", which is also on the way to the Falls. It is an exciting boat ride,\
  \ where we can see the waterfalls from inside the Igua\xE7u River. We did the \"\
  dry\" ride because we had not taken bathing suits. But there is the option of the\
  \ \"wet\" ride, in which the boat literally goes under some smaller waterfalls,\
  \ a shower for no one to fault!\nWe also did a bus tour at the facilities of the\
  \ Itaip\xFA Hydroelectric Power Plant, which enchanted me with its greatness and\
  \ the information and stories told by the experienced guide who accompanied us.\n\
  In short, the trip was obviously no sacrifice at all. On the contrary, Foz do Igua\xE7\
  u was a pleasant surprise and left me wanting to return to know the other attractions\
  \ that we could not see, such as the visit to the interior of the Hydroelectric\
  \ Power Plant, the boat ride through its dam, the walk through the Falls Argentinean\
  \ and several others of this surprising place."
