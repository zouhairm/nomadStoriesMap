Text: "\u201CAre you saying there will be a lifelong ban on tourists just because\
  \ the Devta said so?\u201D \n\nThis was my third day at Chanshal pass, which is\
  \ literally a strip of road that connects the barely known villages of Dodra and\
  \ Kwar to the rest of Himachal Pradesh. About 3 miles before the pass is a dhaba\
  \ (roadside eatery) run by two brothers, Harry and Hemu, they also own a camping\
  \ site, where you can pitch your own tent.\n\nLiving in Mumbai all my life, I used\
  \ to feel like a stranger in my own country, hence as soon as I turned 30, I started\
  \ travelling to places that I didn\u2019t even know existed. Of course, this decision\
  \ was instantly met with several protests and \u201Cwell meaning\u201D advice from\
  \ friends and family. I was constantly reminded how India, besides a few cities,\
  \ was not a safe place for solo women travelers, but I had made up my mind. And\
  \ so my quest finally brought me to Dodra and Kwar. \n\nThe plan was to take a bus\
  \ from Delhi to Rohru, stay a night there, and take an early morning bus to Dodra.\
  \ But while passing through Chanshal, on a whim, I decided to camp there for a few\
  \ days. \n\nOn my third afternoon, I was sitting on a rock opposite the dhaba, and\
  \ Hemu kept me company along with steaming cups of tea, spiced with local herbs.\
  \ The cold mountain winds felt almost friendly with a hot cup of chai.\n\nSo far,\
  \ Hemu had told me about a rabid dog on the loose that no one could do anything\
  \ about, due to lack of animal control. And how just a single ambulance patrolled\
  \ the villages in every 3-4 days in case someone needs to go to the nearest hospital,\
  \ 36 miles away. I, on the other hand, told him about my life back home. He was\
  \ spellbound by the idea of Uber!\n\nI found Hemu's stories bizarre, but the one\
  \ about the village deity topped the list. According to him, Chanshal pass and the\
  \ road leading to Dodra and Kwar was built only round 2009, because the villagers\
  \ were against the idea and agreed only once their Devta \u201Cagreed\u201D to the\
  \ government proposal. Now, the Devta had \u201Cspoken\u201D again to the villagers\
  \ and \u201Cordered\u201D that tourists should not be allowed to come in the village.\
  \ So they were considering a lifelong ban even though tourism was one of their primary\
  \ sources of income.\n\nI am not sure if I was more surprised by the regressive\
  \ thinking or the way he spoke of the deity as though he was a living person. He\
  \ was surprised to learn that I had more faith in goodness of people than in God.\
  \ We did not discuss it further, there was a sudden unspoken agreement to not challenge\
  \ each other's faith. Instead, we just sat quietly sipping our tea, listening to\
  \ old time radio, since there was no internet or reception on my phone. \n\nAfter\
  \ a while, a truck stopped by and two guys got off to have some tea. As soon as\
  \ they left, Hemu went inside the dhaba and got busy washing a pile of utensils.\
  \ I continued to sit outside, sipping my tea, relaxed and lost in the meadows and\
  \ the fresh air, something I was not used to back home.\n\nAbout two minutes later,\
  \ Hemu ran out, yelling something in the local language. The truck driver had parked\
  \ the truck and both men were loitering around, a little ahead of where I was sitting.\
  \ He repeatedly asked them to leave and stood his ground till they reluctantly drove\
  \ away. Hemu asked me if I could sit inside the dhaba while he washed the utensils.\
  \ I asked, \"why?\", and without skipping a beat he said, \"I am scared of the rabid\
  \ dog and was wondering if you could keep me safe\". We both looked at each other\
  \ for a moment and laughed.\n\nThat same night, he would also turn away a bunch\
  \ of customers because I had fallen asleep inside the dhaba and he didn\u2019t want\
  \ drunk men around. \n\nMy faith grew a little stronger that day, Hemu doesn't know\
  \ why."
