Text: "It\u2019s 3:15 in the morning and my alarm keeps going off, demanding compliance.\
  \ I drag myself out of bed and down to the kitchen where I attempt to complete a\
  \ simple task: make instant oatmeal in the microwave. A few seconds too long turned\
  \ a benign vessel into an active volcano of molten hot goo. Good start for our trip\
  \ to the island nation of Cuba. \n\nMy desire to visit this almost mysterious destination\
  \ was born years earlier, when my mom would make a dish called \u201Cropa vieja\u201D\
  \ or \"old clothes,\" and speak about the Cuban neighbors she had when I was a baby.\
  \ Years later, I listened to music from and influenced by Cuban musicians, which\
  \ made me want to go even more. As luck would have it, Boston was cold and travel\
  \ deals to warm places were hot, so a trip to Cuba was booked.\n\nOur travel day\
  \ finally arrived and a few hours after my oatmeal mishap, I look out the plane\
  \ window to see the coastline of our destination. After the usual customs and currency\
  \ office rigmarole, we grab a cab to La Habana Vieja or Old Havana. The roads in\
  \ are decent enough and at least half of the cars on the road are American classics\
  \ from the 1950s. Future conversations with the locals would reveal how much pride\
  \ is taken in the state of those cars and how tedious they are to maintain, due\
  \ to difficulty in procuring parts.\n\nThe streets of Havana are like any city in\
  \ the world: filled with interesting sights, smells and activities. Every city and\
  \ town is unique, with different histories and topographies, but some things are\
  \ consistent throughout. Dominos, dancing, dining and drinking: all essentials to\
  \ living well. Our stays are always in casas particulares, which are essentially\
  \ private homestays where the host benefits financially and both parties benefit\
  \ culturally. Every host will turn out to be very gracious and welcoming, with plenty\
  \ of questions about us and what life is like where we\u2019re from. It\u2019s a\
  \ good opportunity to put my conversational Spanish to the test and though the struggle\
  \ is real, we manage to understand each other. \n\n\u201CEs complicado\u201D is\
  \ probably the most frequently used expression when I ask folks about their country.\
  \ Everywhere we go, we are confronted with the realities of trade embargos and strict\
  \ government controls. Some basic materials and food stuffs aren\u2019t always easy\
  \ to find. Items we take for granted, such as certain spices or guitar strings,\
  \ can be expensive and the supply isn\u2019t consistent. This struggle has led to\
  \ a country full of the most resourceful people I\u2019ve ever met. That resourcefulness\
  \ extends to the artists and musicians who can make the most out of very little.\
  \ Old instruments, worn out strings, beat up drum heads can\u2019t hinder the high\
  \ level of musicianship and musicality I find here. Artists with no supplies will\
  \ take a pile of garbage and make something magnificent. Life finds a way.\n\nOne\
  \ can read a guide book about a place but it\u2019s the people who make a place\
  \ what it is. The most striking and personal aspect of Cuban society is how color\
  \ is viewed. I grew up in the U.S. and have a Caucasian mother and a father of African\
  \ descent. I often find myself caught between worlds and cultures, being asked \u201C\
  what are you?\u201D by strangers and occasionally pressured into \u201Ctaking a\
  \ side.\u201D The Cubans I\u2019ve interacted with assume I\u2019m Cubanita because\
  \ I look like most of the population, which is very racially integrated. It\u2019\
  s the only country I\u2019ve been to where I didn\u2019t look so different from\
  \ everyone else. No one asks and I don\u2019t have to explain or identify with anything.\
  \ This is small bit of freedom is something I didn't expect to find. Freedom from\
  \ a label or a box to check. Free to just be in a beautiful, broken, mysterious\
  \ and incredible country."
