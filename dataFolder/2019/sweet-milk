Text: "The great day had come. It was the first time I was flying in an airplane.\
  \ The first time I left Brazil. Many doubts hovered in my head. The first connecting\
  \ flight was peaceful. Eleven hours flight later; I arrive to the dreamland of the\
  \ Queen. I was received by a federal police officer , a beautiful blue-eyed woman,\
  \ who started asking me questions. I was not nervous and answered the questions\
  \ calmly. Nevertheless, the blue-eyed woman looked suspiciously at me, took my passport\
  \ and informed me that I had to wait them to locate and hand search my luggage.\
  \ I was not nervousl, because I knew that everything was okay. All  passengers were\
  \ released, but me .\n\tA male officer  accompanies me to the luggage terminal,\
  \ asking me a lot of questions all the way. Again, I answered the same questions\
  \ asked by the blue-eyed woman. They found my luggage and too me to a place where\
  \ they hand searched my belongings. They started tinkering with my things. I'm cool\
  \ though, because I knew everything was all right. Then, they find a milk jam bar\
  \ that might just looks like weed bar. I totally forgot my friend asked me to take\
  \ this to him. The police officers looked at the object with a strange face and\
  \ asked me what it was. I tried to explain that it was a typical Brazilian sweet,\
  \ but I did not remember how to say milk jam in English, so I said \u201CSweet Milk\u201D\
  . Everyone failed to understand. I tried to clarify that it was just a Brazilian\
  \ food I was taking to my friend. They open the package and smell it, still suspicious\
  \ that it could be a nice pack of drugs.  Then, five police officers gathered to\
  \ analyze the package. It looked like r an investigation movie scene. At that moment,\
  \ I was sent to the \u201Cinmates\u201D room\n\tNeither cell phone signal, nor internet\
  \ were available to let my parents and friend know what was happening. I was called\
  \ for a new interview. The blue-eyed woman sat behind me and watched me, while the\
  \ boy who helped me found my luggage asked the same questions again. I respond calmly.\
  \ I return to the inmates' room. Three hours had passed since I had arrived. I was\
  \ getting despaired.\n\tI am not calm anymore. I started thinking that I would not\
  \ be able to enter the country.  My eyes were filled with tears, I said a prayer\
  \ and as if it were a miracle, they finally called and released me, apologizing\
  \ for the inconvenience. I got my luggage, the half of the milk jam (I think they\
  \ have eaten a piece to test), my passport and went towards the exit. I saw my friend,\
  \ I dropped the luggage on the floor and I jumped to hug him. I could finally breathe\
  \ in peace the cold air of London.\n\tAfter visiting  the famous Big Ben, the London\
  \ Eye, walk across the Tower Bridge, taking photo in the red telephone box, enjoying\
  \ the beautiful view from the Greewinch Park, feeling a loud buzzing sound in the\
  \ ear after riding the first time the underground train, knowing the history of\
  \ England at the British Museum; I began thinking about the big leap into the unknown\
  \ I had to give to have all these experiences, about the fear I had in immigration,\
  \ and the \u201Csweet milk\u201D that almost got me deported. I realized that sometimes\
  \ jumping is scary. You do not know what you may find when you land, but what matters\
  \ is what you see when you are \u201Cflying\u201D. Your vision is different. You\
  \ see the world with other eyes. After you take the first leap, it is impossible\
  \ to stay on the ground. The desire to jump back and find new visions grows within\
  \ your heart. You only put your feet on the ground just to take impulse for the\
  \ next leap.\n\nP.s: next trip, do not put a milk jam bar in the suitcase."
