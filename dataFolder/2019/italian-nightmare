Text: "Summer of 2017 I packed my bags and traveled with two of my best friends and\
  \ boyfriend. I was the only one who had previously been for a study abroad program,\
  \ so they were in for a treat. A few days into our month long journey, we headed\
  \ off to Italy. While in Italy, we visited many cities. It was not until we made\
  \ it to La Spezia that we had made a local connection. \n        Shortly after settling\
  \ into our Airbnb, everyone was keen on going downtown to enjoy the nightlife, something\
  \ that we do not get to experience as much in the US. On our way out, one of the\
  \ locks had broken in the elevator door and we did not know what to do. Not thinking\
  \ much about it, we carried on and tried to enjoy our night. I sent a quick text\
  \ to the Airbnb host hoping they would not fine me. After a few hours of exploring\
  \ the city, midnight crept upon us and we decided to head home and wash up. However,\
  \ when we arrived to the Airbnb, our door to the apartment would not open. None\
  \ of us realized the significance of the broken key in the elevator. We assumed\
  \ it was strictly for the elevator and not the apartment. After what seemed like\
  \ forever, we could not pry the door open. Panic began to set in because none of\
  \ us were prepped to sleep on the cold tile floors. We were dressed for a warm summer\
  \ afternoon and we did not expect for the temperature to drop so rapidly. My boyfriend\
  \ Tommy attempted to scale the building and we even tried to use a bobby pin to\
  \ open the door. After two hours of trying, nothing was working. I decided that\
  \ our only option was to knock on our neighbors door and pray that they had a universal\
  \ key for the elevator that would work on our door. It was not until we tried two\
  \ floors down that to our surprise, someone finally opened the door. That is when\
  \ we met a nice, young man named Harry. Harry was not shy because he opened the\
  \ door naked, which definitely threw us off. We explained our predicament, he threw\
  \ some clothes on, and came to our rescue. Sadly, Harry had no luck either with\
  \ the door. With no luck in site that the door would magically open, we had all\
  \ felt defeated. Jet lag had been settling in hard and the light had burnt out in\
  \ the hallway, so it was pitch black. It was nearly two thirty in then morning by\
  \ this point. Harry took notice to this and said \u201CWait here, I will be right\
  \ back. I have a present for my lovely American friends.\u201D Roughly five minutes\
  \ later, he returned carrying a bottle of wine and a candle. He said \u201CI had\
  \ to retrieve this from my trunk for my American friends who are so sad. Come on\
  \ let us enjoy!\u201D He took Tommy to his apartment to grab some glasses so we\
  \ could enjoy it.  It was the kindest gesture and all of us were blown away. Harry\
  \ ended up sitting with us until just before the sun had risen. He was giving us\
  \ the \u201Clocals only\u201D restaurants to check out, the history of the city,\
  \ and fun stories of his life. Over the course of a few hours, this stranger had\
  \ become our friend. Harry was not someone we would have ever encountered if our\
  \ door had opened up. You may be wondering why we did not contact the property owner\
  \ or Airbnb host. Well, our phones had died and I attempted to call them as many\
  \ times as I could before it did. We ended up being locked out for thirteen hours\
  \ total. This was not something expected, but we made the best of the situation.\
  \ The encounter with Harry is something my friends and I hold close to our hearts."
