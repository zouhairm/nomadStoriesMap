Text: "In the Native American culture, the White Buffalo is a rare and sacred creature\
  \ symbolizing sacred life and abundance. A perpetual traveler, I sometimes experience\
  \ \"White Buffalo moments\", as I call them \u2013 rare and captivating experiences\
  \ that come in many forms. These little pockets of magic are strange and enchanting,\
  \ ranging from discovered communities where an overwhelming sense of positivity\
  \ can be felt, or a city or piece of land with a strange magnetism to it \u2013\
  \ as if a magnificent spell had been cast upon it. These White Buffalo moments seem\
  \ to be waiting patiently just around the corner, and finding them is one of life's\
  \ greatest treasures. For the past month, I've taken up camp in a small fisherman's\
  \ village on the southeast coast of England where I've stumbled upon a tiny community\
  \ of shanty singers and musicians that meet twice weekly in a 500-year-old pub to\
  \ entertain one another and sing the shanties of their ancestors before them. It\
  \ has been a great privilege to sit and play music with members of this beautiful\
  \ and kind-hearted community and I will not forget their kindness and passion for\
  \ their land and tradition. \n\nI present you with, \"White Buffalo\", a song I\
  \ have written about these special moments I have experienced: https://youtu.be/-ACBy_cbShQ"
