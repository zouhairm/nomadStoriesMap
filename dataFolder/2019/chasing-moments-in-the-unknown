Text: I am a 29 year old girl raised in Perth, W.A. Only ever seeing glimpses of some
  sort reality that may be out there by the T.V Screen, Magazines, Newspapers or Media
  outlet. Forever looking up at the stars at night and truly wondering how big this
  world really was, what was really out there... I could hardly sit around for the
  rest of my life, in the most isolated city in the world, wondering these things,
  and deep down believing I trusted what was put on the screen was the real deal?
  I wanted to learn, be amongst cultures, see beyond the country I had lived in for
  nearly 30 years. I didn't want to know exactly where I was going, I didn't want
  expectations or others preconceived ideas pre-filling my adventures to come... I
  believed there was something magical in the unknown, like space and time would somehow
  mesh together perfectly creating your own exciting moments that existed somewhere
  in the future. Moments I knew would be indescribable, unimaginable, and only ones
  existing when travelling to the unknown. The people, nature, scenery, culture, events,
  music, etc etc the list goes on... it could be anything that comes together at a
  random time, synchronising to create a memory or story. It seems to be special and
  unique to each moment and person, you couldn't plan or buy it. So my travel story
  will start with my travel purpose; to blindly chase unexpected moments, whilst capturing
  my own unique perception of the amazing places I visit, emphasising the endless
  wonder,difference and beauty the world offers.
