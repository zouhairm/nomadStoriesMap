Text: "I contain multitudes, but the universe is a puzzle of infinite proportions.\
  \ I never felt that more strongly than when I lived on a ship for four months, sailing\
  \ around the world. From my room on deck 7, I breathed in salt from waves crashing\
  \ against the ship. The spray flew up, and up, and up until it was all over my window,\
  \ all over the decks, all over my clothes and all up in the air so nothing was certain\
  \ except the fact there\u2019s something bigger out there than you and me. I once\
  \ met an opportunity to forget how futile life is and fell in love with it. The\
  \ sea introduced me to an opportunity to remember how extraordinary life is, and\
  \ be humbled by it. I couldn\u2019t fall in love with the ocean. It\u2019s not sustainable,\
  \ so I opened myself up to religion. I wanted to come home with something more than\
  \ just bags. Something I could get high with. Something that\u2019s music to the\
  \ soul instead of the ears. I found that something in India. Something different,\
  \ something infinite. I met Lakshmi at a temple in Mumbai, goddess of wealth and\
  \ prosperity. A man greeted me in English with \u201Cgood luck to you!\u201D as\
  \ he tied a red and yellow string onto my wrist. Another handed me a lotus flower\
  \ in exchange for a few coins. As I watched the women in front of me pray to this\
  \ powerful goddess behind a haze of incense, I was somehow transported back home.\
  \ Home, with my mother and our seances, the fairy notes she would leave for us in\
  \ the garden, the full moon parties, the energy from the Greek goddesses always\
  \ surrounding our home as Stevie Knicks floated out of the speakers. My mom was\
  \ always a witch for Halloween, and the costume was just a formality. She filled\
  \ my childhood with phantasmagoric and whimsical things. I filled my adolescence\
  \ with dangerous and fleeting things. At this temple, at this moment, breathing\
  \ this incense, I am at the point where past and present have met up. The point\
  \ where I have to decide if I\u2019m going to stay wavy or go straight. The point\
  \ where I have to choose, knowing what I know about suffering, about pain, about\
  \ injustice, about guilt, am I going to commit to radical hedonism a l\xE1 Lord\
  \ Henry in Picture of Dorian Gray? Or am I going to find fulfillment in understanding\
  \ there\u2019s an aspect of life that\u2019s more powerful than suffering that we\
  \ can reach if we look outside ourselves? I clasped my hands together and prayed,\
  \ repeating the goddesses name and a mantra. I let Lakshmi\u2019s energy move to\
  \ wherever the universe felt it needed to go. She, the universe, everything that\
  \ matters must have felt me needing her, because, for just a moment, she moved through\
  \ me. So this is what it feels like to pray...."
