Text: "Boarding the ship from Spain to Morocco, I clung to my privilege like a life\
  \ raft. It was what would lift me out of this strange land in a few days; it was\
  \ what would protect me from the leering gazes; it was what would allow me to peer\
  \ into a life I was certain I would never want to live permanently, but one that\
  \ I could endure to look on at for a few days, because, candidly, as a white college\
  \ student studying abroad in Spain for the semester, my privilege defined me, protected\
  \ me, promised me that I would never be stuck in one place for too long. \n\tThat\
  \ same day, I stand at the wharf of Tangier with my fellow Americans and the Moroccan\
  \ students, Walid and Rebab, who were showing us their city. Grey water blended\
  \ with grey sky, an abyss. But in that abyss, a darker grey. Walid explains that\
  \ that darker grey is the coast of Spain. He tells us that his visa to go there\
  \ has just been rejected, after months of waiting. I think back to mailing my passport\
  \ to the Spanish embassy in New York, receiving it back a few weeks later, and lamenting\
  \ that my visa picture was rather unflattering. My privilege is a stutter as I search\
  \ for words of condolences. \n\tI later sip Moroccan tea as the sun sets on Tangier.\
  \ We wait in our hotel for a guest speaker. Angelina enters, two-week-old baby at\
  \ her 18-year-old breast \u2014 her third child. Rebab translates from French to\
  \ English as she and another woman tell their story of their arrival to Tangier.\
  \ How they walked for months, upward, from Mali, how they were separated from their\
  \ families along the way, how they saved every day for illegal boat passage to Spain,\
  \ how they didn\u2019t know what they would find there, but that life on European\
  \ streets must be better than life here. My privilege is a salty tear, meandering\
  \ down my cheek.\n\tThe next day we arrive in Rabat, are divided into pairs, and\
  \ sent home with host families. Mine has a seven-year-old son, who speaks no English,\
  \ but proffers a deck of Uno cards. We learn that competition and laughter supercede\
  \ language barriers. Our game ends when the host mother approaches us with two buckets\
  \ and stools, and leads us out of the house. We meet the rest of our group, babble\
  \ in English after our two hour language-fast, and head to the hammam, lead by a\
  \ local woman, our uncovered heads bobbing after her shrouded one through the streets.\
  \ \nWe enter the steamy building, reminiscent of a high school locker room after\
  \ gym class.. We change into our bathing suits, most of us in one-pieces in an attempt\
  \ not to offend the local culture of modesty. Our previously shrouded leader stands\
  \ in front of us, hands on her hips, naked, except for her underwear. \u201CLadies,\
  \ there is no shame here.\u201D Frantic looks are followed by hesitant undressing,\
  \ and I stand, naked, in a room of strangers and friends. We enter the steam filled\
  \ room and perch on our stools; our arms are incapable of finding a comfortable\
  \ place to rest. And then, slowly, I feel as if my privilege becomes the dead skin\
  \ that a stranger sloughs from my back.\n\tBut privilege isn\u2019t a raft, a stutter,\
  \ a tear, or dead skin. It doesn\u2019t save you from drowning; it shields you from\
  \ jumping into new, potentially uncomfortable situations. It can\u2019t be talked\
  \ over, be wiped away with a tissue and forgotten, and it can\u2019t be scrubbed\
  \ away, no matter how hard we may try. It comes back, most definitely when you\u2019\
  re trudging up a hill to reach a farmhouse in rural Chefchaouen, and sticks to you\
  \ like the rain-soaked clothes on your back, like the mud on your new white sneakers.\
  \ And then it grows, a boulder on your shoulders as you talk to a thirteen-year-old\
  \ girl who has left school to help at the family farm. It\u2019s the pebble in your\
  \ shoe as you walk through one of the most dangerous borders in the world, freely,\
  \ uninhibited, out of the strange land, and back into its."
