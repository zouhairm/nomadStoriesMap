Text: "Awoken once again by the blast of a gym whistle shattering the silence of the\
  \ cold dark autumn morning. It was time to assemble in formation and begin our morning\
  \ exercises.  As I reluctantly shed my sleeping bag, I noticed that my bones and\
  \ muscles had become jelly and completely useless; an unfortunate side effect of\
  \ intense kung fu training and sleeping on a stiff plywood bunk bed.  Despite my\
  \ newfound condition, I proceeded to suit up once more in my traditional light blue\
  \ uniform and headed outside ready as I would ever be.\n\nThe sun had yet to peer\
  \ over the high mountains surrounding the temple grounds.  Only a handful of dim\
  \ lights lit the entrances of the schools that lined the steep road leading to the\
  \ dormitories.  I stood at attention next to my much younger classmates awaiting\
  \ orders.  I spoke no mandarin whatsoever.  The only translator was a 13-year-old\
  \ student by the name of Daniel.  He was always next to me during training and was\
  \ always delighted to help. \n\nMaster Li then came from around the corner with\
  \ his hands tucked inside his uniform, pacing back and forth in front of the line\
  \ of students. Master Li was short in stature with a round belly and a great big\
  \ smile. He seemed kind and caring yet commanded respect in the way he carried himself.\n\
  \nHe had stopped for a brief quiet moment and then proceeded to shout in mandarin.\
  \ My mind raced, dreading what he was saying and the training that would follow.\
  \ As he finished the students began to smile and cheer so I quickly turned to Daniel\
  \ looking for the reason and translation. To my astonishment it was a day off. Master\
  \ Li claimed that it was too cold for training, and I could not have been more relieved.\
  \ I didn\u2019t think the Shaolin took days off but I wasn\u2019t going to argue\
  \ with it. \n\nI decided to use the opportunity to get some great shots of the temple\
  \ and the surrounding area. After a humble breakfast consisting of rice soup, white\
  \ bread and boatloads of Sichuan peppercorns, I gathered my backpack and cameras\
  \ and quickly headed off for adventure, instead of resting.  \n\nThe sun now lit\
  \ up the entire valley. Mountains in every direction cover by tall cypresses and\
  \ redwoods. Carved granite lions, crimson red flags, and an immense stone paifangs\
  \ were everywhere.  Beautiful stone blocks made uniform paths through the trees\
  \ and along the many shrines and quintessential Chinese imperial architecture. Monolithic\
  \ statues of warriors past shadowed the hordes of flashing lenses and eager sightseers.\
  \ \n\nContinuing past the pagoda forest along a beautiful path through the woods\
  \ I wandered, letting the lens guide me. The path then turned to stairs, So I climbed\u2026\
  .and I climbed\u2026.and I climbed. It seemed as if there was no end to these stairs.\
  \  Through the forest zigzagging left and right and always up. \n\nAs I climbed\
  \ I saw no one else, just more stairs. At this point I had become fully invested\
  \ and turning back was most certainly not an option. My entire body ached as I continued\
  \ up the path. The trees began to thin, as the air grew cold.  Stair after stair\
  \ I continued to climb until I finally came to a plateau with a small green cable\
  \ car in full operation unloading more tourists. How could this be? What was up\
  \ here? I thought to myself as I caught my breath. \n\nAs I turned to take in my\
  \ surroundings I saw it. Up high in the far away cliffs, nestled on the side of\
  \ a mountain, was the most beautiful monastery one could ever imagine. Precariously\
  \ placed in the most inaccessible place imaginable. A tiny almost invisible trail\
  \ could be seen hugging the mountainside leading across bridges piercing through\
  \ the clouds.  I knew then exactly why I had come all that way and why I could not\
  \ stop. When I finally arrived dragging myself up the last few steps I sat down\
  \ in with absolute pride and exhaustion. I then sat back and smiled because sometimes\
  \ when we get lost, we end up finding ourselves."
