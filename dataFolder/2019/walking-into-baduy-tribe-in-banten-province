Text: "\u201CHello, can you show me how to get Baduy village ?\u201D, asked a blond\
  \ girl with blue eyes and carried a 75 liters carrier backpack  when I just arrived\
  \ to Rangkasbitung train station. Eina, the name of a blond girl who confessed that\
  \ she came from Sweden. \u201CEhhm yes\u201D. I answered  her question with little\
  \ nervous.\n\nAfter the short conversation, I and Eina decided to go together to\
  \ Baduy Village. Fortunately, I also went alone to Baduy Village at that time since\
  \ some of my friends cancelled on the last minutes. \n\nWe talked a lot about Baduy\
  \ a long the way. \u201CWhy do you want to visit Baduy Tribe ?, I asked her to open\
  \ the conversation. \u201C I want to visit the tribe because of custome rules that\
  \ they hold firm during to keep their customs from becoming extinct\u201D, she answered\
  \ my question impressively.\n\n\u201CAnd how about you ?\u201D, then she turned\
  \ to ask me back. \u201CUhm, I just want to secede myself  for a moment\u201D, I\
  \ replied her with laughing awkwardly. Yes, as my answer to Eina, I just really\
  \ want to secede myself from the hustle to bustle of traffic jams in Jakarta. I\
  \ heard  and read some articles from internet that the Baduy Tribe are a traditional\
  \ Sundanese ethnic group that live in the Banten Province, a few hours outside of\
  \ Jakarta. The villages where they live are famous, because the Baduy do not use\
  \ modern technology, though is changing.\n\nThe Baduy are split into two distinct\
  \ groups. The first are the communities who live  in the area known as Baduy Luar.\
  \ There are 22 villages that considered a part of Baduy Luar. The second is the\
  \ communities that form Baduy Luar form a barrier to the outside world for the 40\
  \ families who live in the area known as Baduy Dalam.\n\nBaduy Dalam is split into\
  \ the three villages of Cibeo, Cikertawana and Cikeusik. The people who live in\
  \ these villages have limited contact with the outside world and do not use any\
  \ modern technology. The only way to reach these villages is to trek for hours along\
  \ muddy tracks through the countryside.\n\nAfter maybe an hour in a minibus that\
  \ run pretty fast on winding road finally we arrived to Ciboleger Gate, the main\
  \ gate or bus terminal to enter Baduy Village. After eating a plate of Nasi Sunda\
  \ and buying some stuff of our necessities at the minimarket in Ciboleger Terminal\
  \ area, we continued to walk to Baduy Village, the track that we went through was\
  \ quite hard and muddy. \n\nBut, we were really enjoy and never felt tired because\
  \ we saw absolutely gorgeous view along the way, we saw a lot of beautiful houses\
  \ with the same design  made by bamboo and woven coconut leaves as the roofs,  some\
  \ Baduy women were weaving in front of their house, some boys maybe elementary student\
  \ age were carrying bunch of bananas and another crops to help their parents from\
  \ the garden and all the view along the way covered by trees and rice fields, absolutely\
  \ beautiful and made us forgot that we tired because of walking up and down many\
  \ hours.\n\nThe clock showed 4 PM when we arrived at Marengo Village, the second\
  \ village in The Baduy Luar.  We both decided to sleep over  in one of the resident\u2019\
  s house in this village because we were rather tired almost 4 hours walking from\
  \ Ciboleger Gate. There were not many activities that could be done when the day\
  \ got dark because of no electricity here and no signal. The next day we intended\
  \ to explore Baduy Dalam. Unfortunately, Eina can\u2019t visit Baduy Dalam because\
  \ there is a rule that foreigners are not allowed to enter Baduy Dalam. So, only\
  \ me that can visit Baduy Dalam. But, I promised to her that I will tell everything\
  \ about Baduy Dalam to her. Once I got Marengo Village from Baduy Dalam, I told\
  \ her that Baduy Dalam has more strict rules than Baduy Luar, They wear white shirt\
  \ which symbolizes their purity as Baduy Dalam and they more calm than Baduy Luar.\
  \ \u201CUnfortunately you can not see them through your eyes\u201D, I  said to her."
