Text: "On the road, there is neither future nor past. The weight of your pack on your\
  \ shoulders, each step followed by the next step. You have traversed a mountain\
  \ range simply by putting one foot in front of the other, again and again, for as\
  \ long as it took you to cross.\n\nWe lie to ourselves, when we do the hard things,\
  \ in order to make them more bearable. \u201CWe\u2019re almost to the top,\u201D\
  \ my traveling companion and I repeated for nearly two hours. \u201CJust over the\
  \ next ridge, then we\u2019ll be going downhill.\u201D\n\nThe next ridge, and the\
  \ next several ridges after that, proved to be nothing more than small leveling-off\
  \ points of the Pyrenees. Points that were high enough that we could not see beyond\
  \ them, but nowhere near the top. Our muscles burned. The sound of water sloshing\
  \ in my bottle was an agony that made me perpetually thirstier while also making\
  \ me feel that I constantly needed to pee. When I finally caved to the latter need,\
  \ a black snake glared at me from the base of the nearest tree for disturbing its\
  \ rest.\n\nStep by step, one foot in front of the other, never mind the insect bites\
  \ and the sun beating down on our backs. Neither of us is a hiker by nature. We\u2019\
  d met only that morning, both solo female travelers, both panting for breath at\
  \ the first of many uphill stretches of trail.  \n\nAt one ridge we enter a cloud,\
  \ and we take the opportunity for a few moments of grateful rest. Sitting on an\
  \ outcrop, all we see is the grey cloud around us, until suddenly a golden eagle\
  \ stretches its wings in the air nearby and then spirals down the side of the mountain\
  \ in search of prey. A moment later, several other eagles join in, rising and falling\
  \ in a display that could rival the finest symphony. We do not deserve this blessing.\
  \ But we are blessed all the same.\n\nContinuing on the path, our packs feel lighter,\
  \ the agony in our calves and quadriceps abates for a time. One foot in front of\
  \ the other, no reality but the path at our feet. When we finally do reach the summit,\
  \ we cheer aloud and take pictures. We are nearly literally at the top of the world.\n\
  \nThe Camino de Santiago, the Pilgrimage of St. James, has many points of origin\
  \ throughout Europe, all converging on this single trail across the Pyrenees before\
  \ stretching across northern Spain to Santiago and its baroque cathedral. The resting\
  \ place of St. James the Apostle. Neither my new friend nor I are religious, but\
  \ here we are all the same, following in the footsteps of the pilgrims who came\
  \ before us who believed, or not. Somewhere in the sweat and exhaustion we build\
  \ our own cathedral of peaks and trees and eagle wings. The sanctity of nature does\
  \ not care what we believe or what name we do or don\u2019t have for God.  \n\n\
  Downhill brings its own set of challenges. Where the uphill trek burned in our muscles,\
  \ each downhill step seems to jolt in our joints. Previously cooperative ankles\
  \ and knees begin to complain vocally about this treatment, but the path down the\
  \ mountain is narrow, and places to rest are few and far between. Step by step,\
  \ one foot in front of the other. Our packs seem to grow heavier on the descent.\n\
  \nWhen we finally reach the foot of the mountain, it seems nearly unreal to have\
  \ returned to even ground. My muscles are torn between a desire to continue moving\
  \ indefinitely out of sheer mechanical habit and a desire to collapse and not move\
  \ again for some undetermined period of time. We check into the hostel for the peregrinos\
  \ and stumble gratefully into the hot showers, then stumble down the road to the\
  \ cafeteria where we\u2019re served large dishes of pasta followed by an entire\
  \ freshwater fish. We eat every bite and could eat more. Then back to the hostel,\
  \ our legs taking their last protesting steps for the day, one foot followed by\
  \ the next, until we fall into our bunks and sleep dreamlessly until well past dawn."
