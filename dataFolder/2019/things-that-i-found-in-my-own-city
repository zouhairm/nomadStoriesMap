Text: "Travelling is state of spirit. I realized that when I started going to Bel\xE9\
  m Novo, neighborhood in the southern end of Porto Alegre, Brazil, in january this\
  \ year, searching for facts. A housing complex must be built on the Arado farm,\
  \ a simbolic place for old residents of the neigborhood, which has generated discussions,\
  \ especially after an indigenous recapture in the area. \n\nThe first visit was\
  \ work. After that, however, my friend and I went to Bel\xE9m Novo atracted by the\
  \ clear waters of the Guaiba lake, by Bela Vista bar, by Morro do Veludo, by the\
  \ Stone Island, and, especially, by the people who live so close and so far from\
  \ our reality. I was not expecting, unlike other trips I went on, that here of all\
  \ places I would find a place full of natural beauties and histories about a non-tourist\
  \ city. My city.\n\nThe Guaiba lake is almost all contamined, so the dwellers of\
  \ Porto Alegre usually go to the Guaiba lakeshore in the center of the city just\
  \ to watch the sunset and to drink \"chimarr\xE3o\", a tradicional drink made of\
  \ mate and hot water. In Bel\xE9m Novo, however, the lake is good for bathing and\
  \ children can play without fear. During the 40 minutes from downtown to the neigborhood,\
  \ the scenary changes: the buildings give way to old houses and its possible to\
  \ hear the birds sing and to see  people walking around calmly  in this violent\
  \ and paranoid city. In some parts of the road, there is no pavement.   \n\nIn Bel\xE9\
  m Novo, I met Helena. Living in the neigborhood for nearly twenty years, she moved\
  \ to Porto Alegre after she runned  away from home.  Even without much instruction,\
  \ she is one of the most politically commited people I have ever met. Commanding\
  \ the Bela Vista bar, isolated even to the standards of the  neigborhood, she is\
  \ very active and talkative. \u201CI love this place, look at the view! It\u2019\
  s rather sad that the mayor does not see the potencial of this parte of the city\u201D\
  , she repeats all the time. The bar seems frozen in time. The bar goers still listen\
  \ to music in a JukeBox. Old framed texts in the walls and Coca-Cola bottles in\
  \ the shelves are the local decoration. To eat: fried cookie ball.\n\nOutside the\
  \ bar, a stony island on the horizon grabbed  my attention. Fredo and Amaro, both\
  \ born and raised in Bel\xE9m, told me that a Bonsai planted in the Island was stolen\
  \ few years ago.\"Everybody knows about the Bonsai, but nobody can say who stole\
  \ it,\" they laught. The boys, who used to camp on the Arado beach, today occupied\
  \ by indigenous  people, believe that the housing complex will bring only damage\
  \ to the environment. On the other hand, the building constructor Rodolfo, who was\
  \ listening to our conversation, said the environmental and archaeological sites\
  \  in the farm will be preserved. The polarization about the situation could be\
  \ a perfect example of the reality in Brazil nowadays.\n\nIn the final strech of\
  \ the tour, as we  went up Morro do Veludo, location with many old houses, we saw\
  \ a Charming Penelope car in one yard. From inside the house, the owner, Caco Pacheco,\
  \ catched us staring at the car and invited us inside to eat some barbecue. He didn\u2019\
  t  know anything about us but, by chance, we discovered that he was the Ridiculo\u2019\
  s party creator, a famous party em Porto Alegre. There, enjoying the silence  and\
  \ the anonymity  of Bel\xE9m, we came to meet someone involved in many social programs.\
  \ As a hideout, it was also in Bel\xE9m Novo that artists, intelectuals and politicians\
  \ used to go to when things got ugly during the brazilian dictatorship. Leonel Brizola,\
  \ an important defensor of education in the country, played many times in the local\
  \ soccer field.   \n\nWhen I came back home, I needed time to absorve all that had\
  \ happened  and be able to begin to write. I\u2019m not sure if any place in the\
  \ world taught me as much as Bel\xE9m Novo, an unsual  place in my own city. Travelling\
  \ is state of spirit  and it is necessary to keep the mind open to find great stories\
  \ anywhere."
