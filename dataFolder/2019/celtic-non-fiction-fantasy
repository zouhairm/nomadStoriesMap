Text: "I was expecting a night on a day. A full solar eclipse was the first phenomenon\
  \ that bejewel us at the beginning of our journey. It was impossible to see with\
  \ the naked eye, frustrating my expectations to observe the shadows vanishing everything,\
  \ like a big sweep of a fantastic scenario. Unfortunately, the sky\u2019s brightness\
  \ remained the same. Through a soldering glass, we were able to see the uncovered\
  \ sun, while a huge camp fire was set up for the night celebrations. \n\nThat was\
  \ the carnival season, and we were in the extreme South of the country. This big\
  \ popular celebration happens in all Brazilian states. Streets are filled with revelers,\
  \ with colors and music everywhere, people dressed up in costumes, different artistic\
  \ manifestations in all corners, and a huge willing to fall in love. The carnival\
  \ troupe celebrates the drunken-ludic side of the life. Nevertheless, my report\
  \ focuses on an movement aside from traditional festivities.\n\nThe route: Celtic\
  \ Camp. The roadtrip was short. After one hour, the landscapes changed from urban\
  \ to rural, buildings gave space to plains and parked cars to animals in the field.\
  \ We left the capital of Rio Grande do Sul for a city called Three Crowns, a mountain\
  \ region of the state. Same city that houses a famous Buddhist temple.\nStepping\
  \ on the first centimeters of soil a different atmosphere was felt. The sunny Summer\
  \ day didn\u2019t have the usual heaviness, the air was more pure in that region\
  \ full of hills, trees, rivers and small waterfalls.\n\nThere was me, my boyfriend\
  \ and another couple with their teenage son. We choose a little corner in the woods\
  \ among many other tents and set up a camp. The scent of part of the forest close\
  \ to the first prepared meals\u2019 smoke, evoked the idea of ancient communities\
  \ far apart on time.\nThe imposing sound spread over the camp and the Faroe Islands\u2019\
  s winds were there. The Celtic gods had cross the ocean. An ode to the old continent\u2019\
  s mores in the southern America.\n\nIt was four days of immersion, sleeping under\
  \ the light of the stars and the burning torches. Wooden mugs full of mead and craft\
  \ beer dancing by the arms that carried them in clan gatherings.\n\nConcerts and\
  \ performances happened every night, and traditional medieval games competitions\
  \ in the afternoon. Canoes descending the river could see leather suits simulating\
  \ armor, fluttering flags with dragons and shields, helmets, swords and axes rehearsing\
  \ war choreographies.\n\nArrows shot through the trees accounted for disputes among\
  \ the best archers from the clans. Pitches with heavy wooden trunks measured the\
  \ resistance of contemporary warriors. Divination games were also part of this scenario\
  \ - there are always those who seek in occult arts, answers and directions.\n\n\
  Walking through the spaces always caused some surprise such as sighting of flutists\
  \ sitting on small rocks embodying some kind of Gallic archetype. In fact, the influences\
  \ that formed this Celtic web were countless, as European civilization processes\
  \ were influenced by diverse nations and cultures.\n\nThe last light of the day\
  \ fell diagonally through the windows of the great hall. The candid orange glow\
  \ coming from the embers in the stoves caught the most inviting aromas. Even the\
  \ whiniest mouths did not dare to show disagreements over the banquet that would\
  \ gather all clans and solitary souls under one roof.\n\nThat was a feast  proper\
  \ of the salons of Valhalla. Meat, bread, fruits, cakes and grains filled the tables\
  \ and the byword of the day was Odin! His name was called in every toast.\n\n\n\
  In a mood packed by the aura of farewell, collective imagination pulsed even more\
  \ vibrantly. Moonlight crowned the canopy of trees, the fire burned inviting to\
  \ the heathen meeting of the night, its sparks falling like dancing fireflies.\n\
  \nWe spill a bottle of mead dancing like time travelers, jumping, singing in synchronicity,\
  \ between helmets with horns, velvet cloaks, and staffs forming an epic to be depicted\
  \ by Hugin and Munin, Odin's ravens, symbols of memory and thought. Telling this\
  \ timeless carnival tale cherish the maze of my memory, filling the present with\
  \ good memories."
