Text: "That most people are good most of time is an idea that has crossed my mind\
  \ often while traveling around this lovely globe on which we exist. It has since\
  \ lead me to think about what the meaning of good actually is \u2013 as in what\
  \ is right and what is wrong? One begins to realise that what is right in one land\
  \ is not so right in another. A clear example of this was shown to me one day while\
  \ I was walking from the Shoprite in Central Mzuzu to the busy marketplace located\
  \ just across the road. \n\nAs you drive from the capital city, Lilongwe, to Mzuzu,\
  \ you notice the colours changing from a barren brown to a lusher green; less land\
  \ has been cleared for farm use in Northern Malawi. These main roads, which have\
  \ no paths, are also donned with hoards of people on either side coming and going\
  \ from and  to where I do not know. There was smoke in the air as around sunset,\
  \ the locals begin to burn their rubbish. As I crossed this main road, one made\
  \ from concrete, onto the more common red dirt road, I noticed a taxi driver turning\
  \ quite abruptly at the intersection. But as he did so, a bicycle taxi was flying\
  \ down from the main road; and he showed no sign of braking. The collision was inevitable\
  \ and also quite scary but not as frightening as it was about to become. \n\nThe\
  \ cyclist flew from his bike and landed in the bushes. The taxi driver swerved so\
  \ hard that his car ended up on its side in a ditch. The taxi driver then got out\
  \ of the car, and instead of worrying about his own injuries, ran towards the cyclist\
  \ looking to make sure that he was okay. But as he got there, he was suddenly jumped\
  \ by eight people armed with bricks and rocks who then proceeded to whack him with\
  \ whatever they held. After a good 20 seconds of this, he was rescued by another\
  \ passing couple who then began carrying him to safety on the other side of the\
  \ road. As they were crossing, a third lady, a woman I met in person later on (it's\
  \ a very small town, especially for tourists - there are not so many options), jumped\
  \ out of her car and helped the beaten man into the back seat of her car. She later\
  \ told me  that she had brought him straight to a nearby hospital where they treated\
  \ his wounds, which were quite severe by the sounds of things. On arrival, he collapsed.\
  \ They had to carry him into the hospital unconscious.  \n\nWhere I am from, this\
  \ sort of behaviour would not be accepted, but from what I gather, it is the norm\
  \ in Northern Malawi. Their society has its own set of rules. The people who began\
  \ to beat the taxi driver thought that what they were doing was the right thing\
  \ to do; instantly punishing him for his seemingly reckless driving. What seems\
  \ like bad behaviour, might actually have good intent which further legitimises\
  \ the idea that most people are good."
