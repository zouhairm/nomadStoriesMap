Text: "I was just travelling freely and alone, trying to to overcome my father's death\
  \ in a long journey in Europe. I crossed to Spain looking for trawling that amazing\
  \ country.  I visited, after Lisbon and Porto, Salamanca, Madrid, Toledo, C\xF3\
  rdoba and Sevilha.  I took a Bla bl\xE1 car to Cadiz and the driver told me every\
  \ single wonderful thing to do in that region, including cooking, kite surfing,\
  \ dancing\u2026The only one advertisement was:  If you decide to go In Africa, take\
  \ good care with yourself. I\u2019ve never thought to visit Africa and in that moment\
  \ I decided that I will do it in a few days! I enjoyed a few days in Tarifa and\
  \ reserchead how to get in Morocco. It is looked like to be very simple and so interesting\
  \ that I could not find another better plan. I took the ferry felling more than\
  \ happy because I\u2019ve win a new one continent in my passport (backpackers\u2019\
  s things).\nObviously I knew that Marocco is a muslin country. I was wondering about\
  \ how fix the clothes problems. It was too hot and there were in my backpack just\
  \ a couple of shorts and t-shirts. And nothing to cover my shoulders! God send me\
  \ directly to Mohamed, 5 minutes after that I put my foots in Africa's territory.\
  \ Mohamed told me that I should, first of all, visit the Medina of Tangier, place\
  \ where it will be possible to buy the specific garb to fell safe and, more than\
  \ this, to show all my respect to the muslin culture. After he convinces me to waste\
  \ my money buying a Hidjab and a Islamic Hui, I realized that I put a big smile\
  \ in his face while he repets: \u201CComo una F\xE1tima, Como una F\xE1tima!\u201D\
  \ Now, according with Mohamed opinion, I would be able to explore Tanger alone.\
  \ There was no risk of being offended or assaulted by religious fanatics. Mohamed\
  \ for sure is a very good businessman!\nFree of Mohamed\u2019s hand, I decided to\
  \ walk around Tanger in direction to the train station. My ideia was taking the\
  \ night train to Marrakech. I had about six hours to enjoy. It was being amazing\
  \ to try understanding the symbols and the language in a country with a language\
  \ total different. After walk a lot, I was feeling too hungry and tired. I was looking\
  \ for somewhere to eat a typical food but I could not find it. The most of shops\
  \ were closed and I thought that muslin people, probably, used to enjoy la siesta,\
  \ like in Spain. But I couldn\u2019t wait any more to eat, I was almost died, needing\
  \ some energy to go my way under the scorching sun. Like a mirage, I saw a small\
  \ open shop. I went there and bought a bag with the most delicious nuts and dry\
  \ fruits. \u201CTo drink a diet coke, please!\u201D I exited the shop with the food\
  \ on my hands and kept enjoying my walking tour! \nThe atmosphere changed soon and\
  \ I was not feeling like \"Fatima\" anymore. I could feel judging eyes in my direction.\
  \ Some woman crossed the street to the other side, guys spitting on the floor while\
  \ passed next me ... I was not understand what was happening. The only thing really\
  \ very good were the tasty nuts in my mouth. I stopped in a corner to finish my\
  \ lunch time in a little table that I found in front of a closed restaurant. A nice\
  \ gentleman approached me and asked me if I could tell him wich day was that one.\
  \ I said that I hadn\u2019t idea. \u201CLo siento\u201D. He speaks very good Spanish\
  \ and told me that was 06/06 : the first day of Ramad\xE3 in 2016! After his explanation\
  \ about the amazing spiritual celebration and jejum practice, I realized I was committing\
  \ a terrible sin. He said me: - I knew that you are not muslin, the Nike that you\
  \ are wearing can show it! We had a great conversation for more than one hour and\
  \ I understood that to respect a different culture is not about clothes and things\
  \ and it is yes about understandings and exchanges between people with pure soul."
