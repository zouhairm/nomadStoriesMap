Text: I suffering from bipolar disorder for years. And for years i went from another
  pshyciatrist to other pshyciatrist. Feels its not getting better but getting worst.
  Until one day, in my depressed phase, i hated myself so badly and i almost did suicide
  with jump from the bridge, i met this guy. He seems did not stop me to jump, he
  just talked, like talked to himself, he said that i can jump and maybe it make my
  problem over, but how about my family, my friends and peoples who love me? Im not
  solved my problem, i just moved my problem from me to them. They will ask, why i
  did it. I said "why you told that?" He said "cause i know what it feel. My brother
  did suicide years ago. And until know, i keep asking why he did that. And feel guilty
  why we didnt know about his sadness". And since that day, we talked and be best
  friend. He told me to find my healer. I said, "how? I went to pshyciatrist for years,
  and they cant fix my problem, just make it worst" and he said, "why you dont find
  out?". "How?" "Go find out, maybe you dont know what it is now. But soon, you will
  find out" and i dont know why, i decide to go away, far away from people who know
  me, i open the map and pick my destination with closed eyes. Booked  a ticket and
  go without any plan. Just go. And that day, i feel free and alive. I felt comfortable
  with stranger around me, met new people, new place and new tradition. I found my
  healer. And since that day i know, that i cant feel more alive than do traveling
  and meet new people and that is my healer
