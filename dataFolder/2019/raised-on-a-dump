Text: "We sat under a large tree next to Phnom Kulen Waterfall. The air was damp and\
  \ smelled just like wet wood. \u201CI have lived in Siem Reap all my life\u201D\
  , Adika my lovely guide told me in his soft Cambodian accent. \u201CThe other side\
  \ of Siem Reap is a dump \u2013 that is where I grew up\u201D. He looked at me smiling,\
  \ happily flashing his broken tooth. \u201CWe were so poor and we had nowhere to\
  \ live, we moved often, we lived on dump sites, we stayed until the dump was full\
  \ and shutting down and then we moved on with the other families from that dump\
  \ to another site\u201D. \u201CI didn\u2019t go to school very often, I would mainly\
  \ go hunting for food each day with my brother and sister\u201D. \u201CIf we came\
  \ across the scraps from restaurants and there was too much, we traded for something\
  \ different with some of the other children - sharing was what we did\u201D.  \n\
  \  \u201CBananas!\u201D, he shouted excitedly, \u201CBananas have skins so they\
  \ were clean inside, if you found any bananas you were the lucky one, we all looked\
  \ for bananas\u201D. \u201CThis was your only source of food - collecting it from\
  \ the dump?\u201D. \u201CYes, my father was too sick to work and my mother had to\
  \ take care of my younger brother and sister as well as me\u201D. \u201CWhere did\
  \ you sleep?\u201D, I asked. \u201CWe slept on anything we could find, sometimes\
  \ it was just the rubbish, it smelled, but it was all we had\u201D. \u201COne day,\
  \ I was foraging for food with some other children, I moved some rubbish to see\
  \ what was underneath and I stepped on some broken glass\u201D. He took a small\
  \ bite of his apple. \u201CMy foot became so infected and it swelled up, it was\
  \ so big, I became so ill with fever, my father had to carry me so far into Siem\
  \ Reap to see a doctor\u201D. \u201CI could not walk and my father had to carry\
  \ me all the way back home.\u201D. This time he looked at me with tears and great\
  \ sorrow in his eyes. \u201CMy father had no money to pay for medicine to make my\
  \ foot better, so I had to go without \u2013 the pain was so bad\u201D. He took\
  \ a deep breath, \u201CAfter a long time my foot got better, my mother bathed it\
  \ in water and salt each day and we had no bandages so I wore an old sock\u201D\
  . \n \u201CMy grandparents we killed by the Khmer Rouge, my father and my mother\
  \ were left orphans\u201D. I was not sure how to respond. \u201CMy father had no\
  \ one but his brothers and they were all very young, they were living on the streets\u201D\
  . \u201CThere were so many orphans that were all forced into labour camps, my father\
  \ and his brothers were taken too, they had to work in these camps for very little\
  \ food \u2013 they were whipped and badly beaten, so many children died in these\
  \ camps from diseases, abuse and malnutrition\u201D. I had to brush tears away with\
  \ both hands. \u201COne day a group of children decided to escape, they knew they\
  \ might not make it, but to them being killed was better than living in the camps\u201D\
  . \u201CYour father got away then?\u201D, \u201CYes, he did, but none of his brothers\
  \ made it, they were shot and killed along with many other children, my father and\
  \ two others made it out alive\u201D. \u201CHe and other children lived this way\
  \ until it all ended and he was finally free\u201D. \u201CMy mother also escaped\
  \ a different camp and hid with some other children in the mountains, soldiers were\
  \ always looking for children, either to kill them or take them to a labour camp\u201D\
  . I Physically felt my heart sink. \u201COne day while looking for food my mother\
  \ and father met, they were teenagers and both had lost all their family, they decided\
  \ to stay together and that is what they did\u201D. He looked at me with a raised\
  \ eyebrow and a serious, but gentle look on his face. \u201CThey loved each other\
  \ deeply in a very special way \u2013 respect, love and value, no matter what happened\
  \ they always stayed at each other\u2019s side\u201D."
