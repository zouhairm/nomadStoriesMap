Text: "Welcome to Serifos! To me, the most beautiful of the Cyclades island complex\
  \ but also Greece. It\u2019s not that I don\u2019t like the other islands, it\u2019\
  s just that Serifos had me from the very beginning, when I first visited ten years\
  \ ago. Of course, that doesn\u2019t mean that you will share the same opinion but\
  \ as in all cases, there are fanatic supporters as well as haters. Either way, I\
  \ happen to be a fanatic who will try to make you see that you need to visit. \n\
  What I cherish more in the island is its people. They are always smiling, welcoming\
  \ and willing to open their doors to you with no second thoughts. They can instantly\
  \ make you fit in any group of people and feel mostly comfortable. This year, I\
  \ had the chance to attend a local festival for the 15th of August, at the Agios\
  \ Nikolas church, in Pyrgos. There, I met Ms.Eleni, who talked to me about love\
  \ and companionship. She\u2019s a person who has been to no other place other than\
  \ Serifos in almost 85 years. Although delicate and petite, she is a ball of fire\
  \ with a vibrant stare and a captivating smile. I could sit there listening to her\
  \ stories, all day long. I fell in love with her, just as I fell for Serifos.\n\
  Arriving at Serifos in just a few hours from Peiraius port (fast ferry is aprrox.\
  \ 2,5 hours and regular is approx. 5,5 hours) and as you reach the dock, the main\
  \ town (Chora) greets you from above. It is said by both fans and haters it is the\
  \ best Chora in Cyclades. Apart from being a natural harbour, Livadi is consequently\
  \ the busiest part of Serifos in terms of tourist traffic. Here, you\u2019ll find\
  \ many little souvenir shops, options for food, coffee and drinks, tour operator\
  \ offices, the one and only bank on the island, as well as the only gas station\
  \ and pharmacy. Also found here is the very popular Yaught Club for coffee and breakfast\
  \ in the morning and cocktails in the evening. For meat lovers and Greek cuisine\
  \ fans, Mpakakaki is the most renowned place to go. Leaving several times throughout\
  \ the day from Livadi, there are plenty of bus tours too for you to take and explore\
  \ the island\u2019s beaches, on a very reasonable ticket fare. Accommodation wise,\
  \ Livadi offers a variety of choices on rooms to let, but if you feel more like\
  \ something on the simple side and a notch more quiet, just around the harbour,\
  \ in Livadakia, you can always camp, since it is one of the most organised and clean\
  \ camping sites in the Cyclades. However, there are also plenty of studios to rent\
  \ there with gorgeous views of the sea. Serifos is known for its authenticity and\
  \ that is one of the main reasons I am so fond of this island. The beaches are not\
  \ organized and the general approach is not being a tourist trap kind of island.\
  \ It is a generous island that offers many options but at the same time makes you\
  \ respect it more.  There is a plethora of beaches for all tastes but also for all\
  \ types of weather. You\u2019ll have at least two to three choices depending on\
  \ whether it\u2019s northern wind blowing or come from the south. Our first and\
  \ most favorite is Agios Sostis, but Lia (morning hours mostly recommended, it\u2019\
  s quieter), Ganema, Vagia, Psili Ammos, Kalo Ampeli, Agios Ioannis, Kentarhos, Sikamia\
  \ and Platis Gialos are all worth checking out as well! This year though, the absolute\
  \ highlight was Maliadiko beach, which I hadn\u2019t visited the previous years.\
  \ A beach with vivid green colored waters, perfect ground to set a tent (it\u2019\
  s the only beach that free-camping is actually allowed) and lots of space for all\
  \ to enjoy. It\u2019s located just after Koutalas where there\u2019s a pebbled trail\
  \ leading to this little paradise. In case you prefer the volume even lower, you\
  \ can always follow the path right on the end of the beach that leads to another\
  \ beach where otherwise you can only access by sea."
