Text: "All eyes were on me as I carefully tore open the large white envelope. Friends\
  \ and family were gathered in the living room of my home to show their love and\
  \ support of my decision. This letter would determine where I would be spending\
  \ the next 18 months as a volunteer missionary for my church. My heart was pounding\
  \ as I read the letter aloud. \u201CYou have been called to serve...in the Mexico\
  \ Hermosillo Mission.\u201D\n \nThe letter informed me that in three months I would\
  \ begin a 7-week training during which time I would be taught the Spanish language.\
  \ A map of the areas I would be serving was included with the letter. When I saw\
  \ that I would be serving in the Mexican state of Sonora, including all the way\
  \ up to the border with Arizona, my heart dropped. I\u2019d heard so many stories\
  \ of the dangerous events that occurred near the border, and I suddenly became very\
  \ fearful. But that fear was something I kept to myself.\n\nMy 7-week training went\
  \ by all too quickly, and before I knew it I was on a plane to Mexico. My Spanish\
  \ certainly wasn\u2019t fluent, but it was enough to get by. The image of Mexico\
  \ in my mind was a foreign, underprivileged place. However, when I arrived in Hermosillo,\
  \ the culture shock that I expected to feel versus the culture shock I actually\
  \ felt was surprisingly minimal. The radio in the supermarket was even playing the\
  \ music of modern pop bands I listened to at home!\n\nMy trainer, a Mexican native\
  \ who I would be spending the next twelve weeks with, guided me through the busy\
  \ downtown streets as I used pesos for the first time to buy necessities like food\
  \ and bed sheets. We lived on the upper floor of a salmon colored building with\
  \ orange roof tiles. I remember the everyday things that I slowly had to get used\
  \ to, such as my first shower. The shower head was simply a pipe sticking out of\
  \ the wall and there was no warm water. But at least there was water, for I would\
  \ later come to learn that during some seasons water could only be used at certain\
  \ hours during the day.\n\nOver the next 18 months, living in Mexico became natural\
  \ to me. We always ate lunch with local families who kindly shared their meals with\
  \ us. It didn\u2019t take long before placing tortillas and limes in the center\
  \ of the table felt like a necessity to me. I ate tacos 4-5 times a week, I spoke\
  \ Spanish without having to translate from English in my head, and I greeted people\
  \ with a kiss on the cheek without giving it a second thought.\n\nA year had passed\
  \ since I\u2019d opened my mission call letter when I decided to return to it. This\
  \ time though, when I read the letter and looked at the map of Sonora, Mexico, I\
  \ did not feel fear. Instead, in the place I had once considered foreign, the familiarity\
  \ of the human connection only brought me an overwhelming feeling of love and humanity.\
  \ Tears filled my eyes as the memories of all the welcoming, loving people and families\
  \ I\u2019d met in Mexico flashed through my mind. I laughed as I remembered how\
  \ they\u2019d helped me stumble through learning Spanish. I smiled as I thought\
  \ of the people who had welcomed me, a stranger, into their homes to share messages\
  \ of hope and love. I cried as I thought of the many miles I\u2019d walked under\
  \ the scorching sun in temperatures over a hundred degrees. I was so grateful for\
  \ and inspired by the culture I\u2019d come to know, live, and love. My perspective\
  \ opened to realize that no matter where we go in this world, we are all just people\
  \ trying to live our best lives, to support our families, and ultimately to be happy.\
  \ That is the gift of humanity that unites us all."
