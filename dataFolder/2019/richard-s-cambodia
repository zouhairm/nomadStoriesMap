Text: "I step across the dock and onto the boat that is swaying violently from the\
  \ other vessels vying for space on the Tonle Sap River. Looking over my shoulder,\
  \ Richard is taking a seat on the small motorbike attached to his Tuk Tuk and gives\
  \ a small wave of encouragement in our direction. Our boat is bound for Kompong\
  \ Phluk, a floating village in the Siem Reap Province of Cambodia. Everything so\
  \ far about Siem Reap has been a shock to my senses and looking over the edge of\
  \ the boat into the muddy water \u2013 undeniably home to the nation\u2019s crocodiles\
  \ \u2013 is a bit unnerving. A few minutes\u2019 journey down the river, the first\
  \ indication of life sails into view in the form of a smiling, toothless man, standing\
  \ up and rowing his boat right past us, wearing an NYPD baseball hat. \n\nYesterday,\
  \ Bailey and I landed in Cambodia and found our way to a hostel in the city center.\
  \ Within the hour, a group of English tourists brought us around the corner to what\
  \ they claimed was \u201Cthe best restaurant in Siem Reap,\u201D and introduced\
  \ us to its owner, Richard. Two small children and a young woman peered out from\
  \ the kitchen doorway, eager to spring into action as soon as we ordered something.\
  \ We were the only two guests and it looked like it had been that way for most of\
  \ the day. \n\nThe restaurant itself mirrored much of what was just outside its\
  \ doors. A country in the clutches of poverty and darkened by the shadow of an all\
  \ too recent genocide. The never-ending stream of motorbikes zipping past on the\
  \ unpaved dirt road kicked up clouds of dust and settled on the framed photos of\
  \ food hanging slightly askew on the walls. The few tables that were provided were\
  \ covered in aging plastic, and the menu showed a mixture of well-known Thai dishes\
  \ and what many locals in Southeast Asia considered to be \u201CWestern\u201D specialties.\
  \ Where were the traditional Cambodian dishes? What was a traditional Cambodian\
  \ dish? I felt embarrassed for not knowing and wasn\u2019t quite sure how to ask.\
  \ \n\nOver plates of Thai Chicken Cashew Nut and a side of \u201CFried French,\u201D\
  \ Richard told us about his Tuk Tuk and insisted that we let him show us around\
  \ Siem Reap. We could hardly say no with his four-year-old daughter smiling up at\
  \ us with her oversized brown eyes, full of mischief and ghosts of the tourists\
  \ before us that she had surely trapped the same way. Tomorrow morning, at the break\
  \ of dawn, Richard would be our guide.\n\nComing into view on the Tonle Sap, the\
  \ homes sat teetering about twenty feet high on stilts above the water. Everywhere\
  \ I looked, men were fishing, women hidden under wide hats to protect themselves\
  \ from the relentless rays of the sun were making shrimp nets, and children were\
  \ running to their balconies to wave as yet another boat of open-mouthed tourists\
  \ gawked at their way of life. The boat slowed around a turn, revealing a small\
  \ naked girl with skin the color of rich caramel sitting in a large metal bowl on\
  \ the river, bathing herself with the murky water. She looked up at us and a smile\
  \ spread across her face. She reminds me of Richard\u2019s daughter.\n\nThe Tuk\
  \ Tuk pulls to a stop in front of Richard\u2019s restaurant, just as the sun sets.\
  \ His daughter runs out of the back room with a tear stained face and leaps into\
  \ Richard\u2019s arms. She doesn\u2019t like when he is gone for a whole day, he\
  \ tells us. I feel guilty that I\u2019m partially responsible for her distress.\
  \ We order another round of Cambodian-Thai food from his wife. \n\nIt\u2019s late\
  \ and we are walking back to our hostel as we pass Richard\u2019s restaurant. He\
  \ is closing up for the night, and where the tables stood just hours before are\
  \ two mattresses. This is more than just a restaurant. This is a home. Richard pulls\
  \ the shutter down to secure his home for the night and our eyes meet from across\
  \ the street. He gives a small wave of encouragement in our direction."
