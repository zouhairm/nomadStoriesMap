Text: "A long time ago yet ever fresh in my mind, a group of adventure junkies like\
  \ me decided to venture into the unknown. Where would our pledge to tour the world\
  \ take us this time? We cast a lot and it fell on Tunisia.\nI remember vividly the\
  \ thought on my mind, its Africa but I had no idea where it was, what they spoke\
  \ or looked like but my answer was yes.\nI couldn\u2019t pass up the opportunity\
  \ to know and explore somewhere new. I did a little research and  found out it was\
  \ cold around December which was good news for me and the people on the google images\
  \ were light skinned; I was intrigued.\nI packed a bag and bid my family farewell.\
  \ We left Nigeria, prepared for a two hour stop-over at Libya.\nI remember the excitement\
  \ and literal goose-bumps as we got to Libya for a two hour stop over. The sight\
  \ and sound was amazing.  That euphoria quickly wore off as a blaring voice came\
  \ over the speaker to announce a long delay due to a storm. It was made worse by\
  \ the fact that we couldn\u2019t leave the airport.\nWe made the best of it by window\
  \ shopping, taking pictures, eating hot dogs and drinks provided by the airline.\n\
  Sleepy and tired with nothing but the cold metal of the airport benches to sleep,\
  \ I wondered if Tunisia would be worth it.\nMy hyper active mind going over questions\
  \ and imagining what it would be like, what I would find and who I would find. At\
  \ this point checking that I had my address book, yes, I did. Tunisia here I come.\n\
  Then came the double beep on the speakers and our boarding announcement. Arriving\
  \ at Tunisia and being received by our pickup crew, ceremonial police with smiles\
  \ everywhere was a good start.\nOn our way to the hotel at intervals I saw smoke\
  \ coming out of the flower beds.  Our hosts were quick to explain what we couldn\u2019\
  t see because it was dark.  Policemen were station at various points along the expressway\
  \ and they smoked because it was cold. Less I forget I would name Tunisia the smoking\
  \ capital off the world, till I get to another country that makes me think otherwise.\n\
  For the next couple of days, the four walls of our hotel rooms couldn\u2019t confine\
  \ us. We explored the vast sand domes, mammoth ancient ruins, the exquisite beach\
  \ of djerba, camel rides at Douz which is located at the Sahara\u2019s edge .I had\
  \ only before then been on a horse twice but I wasn\u2019t going to be left out.\n\
  \ We shopped for local crafts and explored the Tunisian night life and by the third\
  \ day we had friend willing to take us everywhere. Patronizing street vendors and\
  \ trying various local dishes was a delight, my favorite was the picture perfect\
  \ kefteji. It combined freshly chopped and fried vegetables, fried egg and homemade\
  \ bread.\nDid I mention that people were staring at us most of the time? Especially\
  \ the locals. It turned out there weren\u2019t many blacks in Tunisia as at 2005.\
  \ Apart from our group, we saw an African turn a street corner and we were so excited,\
  \ he could have been our brother.\nBeing one of the only two girls in the group,\
  \ and with most people only having seen black women only on tv, we were treated\
  \ like celebrities.\nI guess our long weave added to the perception. From the hotel\
  \ to the market we were called princess, African queen and given gifts.\nI also\
  \ found out that most of those we met didn\u2019t speak fluent English or any at\
  \ all, Tunisia and Nigeria had a language in common football. Others call it soccer.\n\
  When they asked where we where from and we said Nigeria,they chorused with two fists\
  \ in the air \u201CRasheed yekini for Nigeria\u201D. This was a chant from African\
  \ world cup 1994 in tunisia when Rasheed yekini scored a goal. \nIt was an adrenaline\
  \ filled adventure, from places,  weather, the people, culture and food, the lot\
  \ brought me to this dream.  I can\u2019t wait for the next."
