Text: "Last month, in Moshi, Tanzania, eight Americans met for the first time. Some\
  \ were Democrats, others Republicans. But despite the partisan wall that divided\
  \ us, we all shared a common goal--to climb Mount Kilimanjaro, the highest mountain\
  \ in Africa. Because of our shared objective, the support we showed one another\
  \ during the nine-days we spent camping, hiking, and climbing on the mountain convinced\
  \ me that our nation\u2019s divisive politics are, like Kilimanjaro itself, surmountable.\
  \  \n\nWe ranged in age from Marissa, age 28, a remarkable young woman who runs\
  \ a wilderness training program in Wisconsin; to the oldest, her father, Skip, age\
  \ 67, a former CFO who owns an Alpaca hobby farm in Illinois.  Marsha and Susan\
  \ are co-workers at a Texas company specializing in higher-education.  James and\
  \ Steve, brothers-in-law, live in North Carolina and work as consultants. And there\
  \ was my tent-mate, David, a fellow New Jersey resident who works on Wall Street.\
  \  \n\nFrom the beginning, we downplayed any contentious topics that arose. When\
  \ a guide from another group wearing a baseball cap emblazoned with the letters,\
  \ NRA, passed us, we all bit our tongues.  Instead, we went out of our way to be\
  \ kind to one another. \n \nJames was our resident photographer. He was constantly\
  \ stepping off the trail to take photographs which he spent hours sorting and forwarding\
  \ to everyone in the group. Steve kept us laughing with a dry, sly sense of humor.\
  \  He later referred to the friendships he\u2019d made with other group members\
  \ as \u201Can unexpected fringe benefit.\u201D \n\nAt night, at the higher elevations,\
  \ when a hot cup of water was much appreciated, Marsha offered her varied assortment\
  \ of delicious teas to all takers.   Unsolicited, David distributed sugary snacks\
  \ to our Tanzanian guides during our SWAT breaks: Sweets for a bust of energy; Water\
  \ for hydration; Always clean your hands to avoid the most feared word on the mountain--\
  \ diarrhea; and Toilet yourself behind the nearest large rock so you could drink\
  \ more water.\n\nWhen Susan\u2019s glove tore, I lent her my sewing kit.  And when\
  \ someone misspoke and said, \u201CIf Mort makes it to the top,\u201D Susan quickly\
  \ corrected them, saying, \u201CYou mean, when Mort makes it to the top.\u201D Skip\u2019\
  s easy manner took our minds off any passing altitude-sickness based headache. When\
  \ we attached our hiking sticks to our back-backs and were scaling the Barranco\
  \ Wall using only our hands and feet, Marissa, who was on the ledge above me, had\
  \ the presence of mind to look down and tell me to move my hand over before she\
  \ took her next step so she didn\u2019t crush my fingers. \n\nWe climbed in close\
  \ proximity to Austrian, Italian, and Japanese groups who were also taking the Lemosho\
  \ Route up the mountain.  And nations looked out for other nations.  This was apparent\
  \ as we scaled the Barranco Wall--especially as we hugged the infamous Kissing Rock\
  \ where one misstep can have you falling into a deep ravine. Later, when Skip reviewed\
  \ a photo of us climbing the Wall, he was surprised to see that, unbeknownst to\
  \ him, someone from another group\u2014we\u2019re still not sure from which country--was\
  \ on the shelf below, arms upraised to brace him if he slipped. \n\nWhen we reached\
  \ the top of the Barranco Wall, an older Danish couple was there taking a rest.\
  \ Over the years, they had travelled throughout the United States and were pleased\
  \ to learn our group represented both Blue and Red states.\n\nTwo days later, all\
  \ eight of us reached Uhuru Peak, the summit of Mount Kilimanjaro. The humanity\
  \ we showed one another enabled us to climb a mountain where several people die\
  \ each year from acute mountain sickness, hypothermia, or falls.  Yet, our success\
  \ didn\u2019t absolve us of disagreements.  But we never engaged in heated arguments.\
  \  Instead, after I asked the group for permission to use their first names to write\
  \ this piece, a calm discussion ensued as to the best venue for publication. Someone\
  \ suggested \"The New York Times\" or \"The Washington Post.\" To which Steve replied,\
  \ \u201CWhy don\u2019t you try 'The Wall Street Journal'? At least I read that one.\u201D\
  \n\nAs the Danish couple told us atop the Barranco Wall, \u201CAmerican is a beautiful\
  \ country.\""
