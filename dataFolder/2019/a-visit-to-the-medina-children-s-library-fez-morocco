Text: "Literature\_has the power to transcend cultures, languages, poverty, and location.\n\
  \tOne of my favorite travel memories was spent on my birthday a few years ago in\
  \ Morocco. While looking online at places to visit, I came across a Facebook page\
  \ for the Medina Children's Library in Fez. As I looked at the photographs of smiling\
  \ children in headscarves and beaming over the pages of well-worn picture books,\
  \ my heart warmed. As a librarian, I love to share literature with children. I happily\
  \ spend my days reading picture books to classes of school children and helping\
  \ them find books for school reports or for just for\_fun. The children in the photos\
  \ reminded me of the children in my own community,\_I knew that I wanted a visit\
  \ to the library to be part of our adventure. I emailed back and forth with the\
  \ librarian, a petite Moroccan young lady named\_Samia. She told me the story of\
  \ the fledgling children's library, how the children in the medina are among the\
  \ poorest in the city. Despite their circumstances, the\_demand\_for the library\
  \ is so great that the children have only a single hour\_time slot per\_day before\
  \ they must leave their book behind so that another group of children can enter\
  \ and take their place among the low cushions and sparse bookshelves. The library\
  \ has a small selection of texts in Arabic,\_French and English, most having been\
  \ purchased by well-meaning tourists, only 25% of the books are in the children's\
  \ native language. Most of the children in Fez are multi-lingual, understanding\
  \ at a young age that speaking French and English can get them a better paying job\
  \ in the tourism industry, and can be their ticket out of the medina and towards\
  \ a brighter future.\_\_Before my arrival, I made sure to stock up on dollar store\
  \ crayons, colored pencils, and sticker sheets, as well as locating a few Arabic\
  \ books available on Amazon.\n\t\_The library itself is a small room at the corner\
  \ of the winding maze of streets in the medina, yet I easily found my way through\
  \ the sudden downpour to the entrance. After removing my muddy shoes at the small\
  \ tiled entrance hall, I was warmly greeted by a series of small hands who divested\
  \ me of my books immediately. Samia introduced herself and with a single sweeping\
  \ arm motion, showed me the entirety of the library. In a single room with a series\
  \ of low bookshelves less than halfway full sat a small group of children eagerly\
  \ choosing the day\u2019s literature. Apart from a sparse desk set up at the entrance,\
  \ the only furniture was a series of low cushions on which the children contorted\
  \ themselves into the most comfortable reading positions. Artwork from the children\
  \ brightened the walls. My husband and I had dinner reservations in an hour and\
  \ were just stopping at the library to drop off books, but I was physically\_guided\
  \ to a\_cushion\_and couldn't say no to several sets of pleading eyes.\_I selected\
  \ my first book, arranged the children and began reading Eric Carle\u2019s classic\
  \ book\_The Very Hungry Caterpillar.\_\_Samia read the text first in Arabic, while\
  \ I repeated in English. The children were stoic as the book concluded, either confused\
  \ about the foreigner in their midst or by my tendency to over\_exaggerate the text.\
  \ One of the smallest children quickly selected another book for me to read, which,\
  \ much to m delight, was a copy of the tale of\_Goldilocks and the three bears.\_\
  \ Several children drifted away to their own stories, while the remaining few crept\
  \ closer to my cushion. By the end of the story, I had a small boy perched on the\
  \ edge of my lap, wanting to fully immerse himself in the pictures and the rise\
  \ and fall\_of my voice, despite his inability to comprehend my language. Stories\
  \ are powerful;\_they can transcend age, cultural differences, and language, but\
  \ they connect us all and make us feel at home."
