Text: "I am a humourist writer, and the power in what I do is finding the funny in\
  \ everyday situations that otherwise could be dismissed as regular. I believe in\
  \ the power of humour so I strive to find it in everything I do, none more so than\
  \ when travelling. The fish-out-of-water trope is very tried, but does lend itself\
  \ to excellent reading. My travel story is just me on an adventure documenting everything\
  \ I do and finding the humourist side where I can, usually being able to find a\
  \ theme to draw it all together. I realise that this description is quite vague\
  \ and relies quite heavily on my charm and ability to craft stories out of everyday\
  \ situations, so for reference here are links to some blog posts(gross, I know)\
  \ I did when travelling that are the style and vibe of what to expect, and what\
  \ I\u2019m hoping to grow upon - https://actuallyharry.com/2017/09/12/week-1-i-am-arriving/\
  \ - https://actuallyharry.com/2017/09/19/week-2-the-good-will-come/ \nI have room\
  \ to learn and grow with the style I\u2019m working on and this opportunity would\
  \ not only be excellent fuel for stories, but a fantastic chance to build my skills\
  \ with guided hands. This scholarship reeks of the exact spirit of adventure I yearn\
  \ for, I would be completely remiss if I passed at the chance to snatch it."
