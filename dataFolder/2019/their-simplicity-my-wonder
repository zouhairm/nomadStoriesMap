Text: "\u201CT\xF4 indo, amor!\u201D says a woman in the corridor, in a smooth Brazilian\
  \ accent. It\u2019s early and I can hear heavy raindrops outside. Visiting the island\
  \ during monsoon season clearly wasn\u2019t the wisest of choices, I think to myself.\
  \ Still, I am excited to be here, so I jump out of bed and get ready to head out.\n\
  In this small hotel all the bedrooms face a central patio, which leads to the main\
  \ lounge now converted into a breakfast bar. As I chase the scent of freshly made\
  \ coffee, I am delighted when I see the dark oak table in the centre of the room,\
  \ adorned with fluffy bread rolls, butter, ham and sliced cheese, a yogurt cake\
  \ topped with strawberry jam, pineapple and native papayas. Charming simplicity.\
  \ All so fresh and vibrant! First guest to arrive, I feel honoured to be presented\
  \ with this feast with all its attention to detail.\nI decide to take a photo and,\
  \ as I pull the camera out of my pocket, a girl in a white uniform approaches to\
  \ greet me. She must be about 20 years old or so. Beautiful dark skin with a wide\
  \ but very shy smile, as if she carries the hope of the world in her eyes. I can\
  \ see she has great pride in her work and is pleased that I like the table. \u201C\
  I love it\u201D I say, adding that \u201CI was about to take a picture, would you\
  \ like to be in it?\u201D, and she nods affirmatively. She strikes a pose, revealing\
  \ a humble smile. Despite her shy personality, we exchange some words, she shares\
  \ a few recommendations. Her name is Jamilia. Inspired by her sense of wonder, I\
  \ am thrilled for the day ahead exploring this unique land.\nFlip-flops on and carrying\
  \ my backpack, I leave the hotel under misty rain. Heading on a 3-hour hike over\
  \ the mountain, I am going to visit an abandoned prison, once home to some of Brazil\u2019\
  s most dangerous criminals. Holding no umbrella, sliding down muddy paths and regretting\
  \ such poor choice of footwear, I am determined to make it to my destination. Fuelled\
  \ by the view of velvety, dense clouds kissing the top of the mountain ahead, I\
  \ turn right at a viewpoint to an infinite landscape dotted with hidden beaches\
  \ down by the coast. I am stunned with the eternal beauty. Further ahead, a majestic\
  \ waterfall inundates me with such sense of gratitude for being here, despite the\
  \ rain.\nArriving at the prison, it becomes immediately obvious that it is closed.\
  \ All I can see are its big gates and its very ancient walls once painted bright\
  \ white, now just too tired. There is no one here, only solitude. A silence broken\
  \ only by the sound of beating ocean waves and vultures flying by, claiming this\
  \ as their place, by right.\nHappy to have made it here, but also hungry and now\
  \ cold, I see a hand-written sign with the promise of a homecooked meal. Following\
  \ the dirt path, there is an old house and a two-choice menu: meat or fish with\
  \ \u2018farofa\u2019 and \u2018whatever you want to drink\u2019, says a man limping\
  \ as he approaches my table. In the kitchen there is a thin woman, obscenely tan-skinned\
  \ and with deep dark hair. She moves slowly, at her own pace. Her decades of cooking\
  \ taught her well, she is in control. As she sees me, she smiles. There is something\
  \ so endearing about her, a motherly warmth in her eyes, now framed by the deep\
  \ wrinkles of living. When she brings my food, I ask how long she has worked here.\
  \ \u201CAll my life\u201D she says grinning, \u201CI have always lived here, I never\
  \ left\u201D. Her name is Teresa, just like my mum. Before leaving, I ask her if\
  \ she hasn\u2019t felt the will to go out, see the world. To this she responds,\
  \ with her honesty and untroubled smile, \u201CWhy would I need to go out and see\
  \ the world, when I have you and I have the world coming here to see me, instead?\u201D"
