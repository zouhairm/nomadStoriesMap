Text: "The magic started 5 minutes before entering the flight from Cancun to London,\
  \ next to me an Estonian couple looked at me intrigued and I corresponded to them,\
  \ after crossing some words we realized that we were traveling on the same line\
  \ of the plane, they came from Guatemala to Estonia. and I was going to Barcelona\
  \ to celebrate my anniversary with a good cacao ceremony.  They were returning home\
  \ to teach the newly acquired cacao knowledge from these sacred lands. \nDue to\
  \ a long scale, we went down to enjoy the hyde park gardens where we did a pact\
  \ to share this sacred seed of CACAO in the northern lands of Europe\n\nIn the early\
  \ summer I arrived in Tallinn to Celebrate the closing of the Mayan calendar, sharing\
  \ for the family of my hosts a beautiful ceremony which was accompanied by songs\
  \ and the excellent vibes of the attendees who let themselves be embraced by the\
  \ power of this seed, singing in the summer sun.\n\nTallin offered me a sparkling\
  \ Baltic Sea and a beautiful view of its central streets that can easily make you\
  \ feel transported to a Disney story, where You can feel invited to know the warmth\
  \ of their people who can easily invite their fruits, or their delicious black bread.\n\
  I had a great experience with a family of small children who invited me to see the\
  \ daily differences between the Latino lifestyle and their peculiar style of order\
  \ in each house. All Start by having the toilet separated from the shower or have\
  \ the need for a double door at the entrance of the houses because of the big frosts\
  \ un the winter, all this gave me more for curiosity to know their culture background\
  \ and discover that mystery that also emerges from that spirit that awaits a being\
  \ discovered.\nI had an invitation to share another ceremony in Vjlandi, a mystical\
  \ city in central Estonia. Before arriving, they impelled me to have a spectacular\
  \ experience in a place called the Soma wetlands. I can barely describe how pure\
  \ AND sacred is that part of the earth surrounded by unique nature that only exists\
  \ in there. I had the chance to jump and play with a bunch of dragonflies at the\
  \ enter of the forest asking for permission to soil the seed of cacao in the heart\
  \ of the estonians .\nThe calm that you can breathe and also the peaceful sounds\
  \ of the forest can give you a relaxing experience while you travel so that makes\
  \ it easier your appreciation of nature in that Green country.\n\nIt is amazing\
  \ to have these kind of trips in the middle of the summer in the northern lands\
  \ of Europe because you can also feel the kindest mood of  people wanting to hang\
  \ out in the streets and festivals. After my cacao sharing we went to beautiful\
  \ concert of ancient chants from Estonia and we made a great Jam between that sacred\
  \ music and the shamanic music from M\xE9xico.\n\nI could also taste the magic from\
  \ the silent  Woodlands near by the coast in Tallin where you can Watch the slow\
  \ change of the sunset where you can also see foxes or swans walking beside you.\n\
  \nAnd if you really want to try how the modern life is runs there so you must make\
  \ an urban walk to explore the city with a huge panorama of muralism and you can\
  \ find out radio station in the middle of a park and ask the DJ to play some music\
  \ from your playlist.\nI can say that it has been one of my favorite places to visit\
  \ because estonians could receive with open heart the powerful seed of cacao and\
  \ they were willing to explore much more.\n\nAt the moment i just can't wait to\
  \ go back and have some new connection in that sacred land that allow anyone to\
  \ get connected with their own spirit due to the ancestral awakening of magic from\
  \ the Old Estonian history.\n\nThank you\nSuur aitah (Estonian thanking)"
