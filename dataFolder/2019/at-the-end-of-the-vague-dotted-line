Text: "Quandongs are not the only fruit. Though you\u2019d be hard pressed to believe\
  \ it heading into the corrugated void of outback South Australia. Among the sausage\
  \ rolls and schnitzel burgers, promises of quandong pie yell out, declared prominently\
  \ on roadside signs pointing to the only caf\xE9 in the only street in the only\
  \ town for many miles around. Stop just after the lights. The only lights. \n\n\
  A native bush fruit, the tangy zing of quandong lingers in my mouth as I venture\
  \ onto one of those roads marked on the map by a vague dotted line. Vague dotted\
  \ lines that crisscross the interior of Australia, sometimes optimistically called\
  \ Development Roads, other times Tracks, some with no name at all. Without the sturdy,\
  \ solid reassurance of bitumen, always an unknown, always an adventure.\n\nThis\
  \ dotted line starts where the bitumen frays in the small settlement of Copley,\
  \ close to the disorienting town of Leigh Creek. Surprise emerges here in the refined\
  \ surrounds, full of looping crescents and eucalypt-lined avenues, a replication\
  \ of a Canberra suburb plonked slap-bang in the desert. The relative hubbub of neighbourhood\
  \ shops offer up some of the last petrol and the last groceries and the last decaying\
  \ fruit other than quandong until \u2013 well \u2013 until who knows where?\n\n\
  From Copley, the Gammon Ranges Road soon transforms into a byway of loose yellow\
  \ gravel and fine copper dust. Occasional dry creeks throw up rockier perils, but\
  \ once these are overcome, and car and driver adjust, it is plain sailing. Running\
  \ in the slots of tyre grooves in the sand, it is like gliding on the water. With\
  \ not a drop in sight.  \n\nMini dust storms appear on the horizon, a sure sign\
  \ that a beat up Holden or a monster ute is making its way into town. As opposing\
  \ vehicles near, our two trails die down as we gently pass, saluting one another\
  \ with a raised forefinger pointing to the skies. Skies that are revealed as harsh\
  \ and blue as the dust settles, and the aptly named Gammon Ranges impress in the\
  \ foreground like a parade of prizewinning Christmas hams. \n\nThe road eventually\
  \ leads to Arkaroola, a wilderness sanctuary where grey nomads, backpackers, and\
  \ wayward tourists can congregate over a camp fire and swallow flies at will. The\
  \ flies are remarkable, swathing white T-shirts black, adorning hats like currants\
  \ overflowing on a Chelsea Bun. Suddenly the people smart enough to wear insect\
  \ nets do not look so ridiculous; and dangling corks just won\u2019t cut it. \n\n\
  The flies have an incredible country to inhabit. Several walking tracks traverse\
  \ the rocky ranges, a trail over Acacia Ridge offering striking views out to a captivating\
  \ nothingness. Others meander along the dry creek walls of Barranarra Gorge, encountering\
  \ blissful billabongs in which shade and nature gathers. For the less energetic\
  \ but intrepid still, the Ridgetop Tour conquers this precipitous country, before\
  \ it can go no more.\n\nGathering in two benches affixed along the back of a four\
  \ wheel drive, the ups and downs of something masquerading as a road make for some\
  \ cosy interactions between strangers. Sat at the back, the uphill sections propel\
  \ the weight of three grey nomads upon my left shoulder. Downhill, and I find myself\
  \ bracing to avert a tumble into a jumble of backpacks and cameras and socks and\
  \ sandals. A jovial exhilaration of shared bumps and giggles, comforted by a fly-less\
  \ breeze. \n\nOutside the confines of our increasingly familiar group, the afternoon\
  \ light reddens the landscape further, embossing spiky shadows of spinifex and xanthorrhoea\
  \ spears into the land. One final, seemingly impossible push in low range culminates\
  \ atop Sillers Lookout. One guy on the tour confesses it is the most amazing sight\
  \ he has ever seen. And how \u2013 staring out into a never-ending, enduring, untouched\
  \ landscape of crumpled ridges and vast sandy plains \u2013 could I disagree. \n\
  \nIn a time and place like this, at the end of a vague dotted line, at the limits\
  \ of the known, it is all I can do to quell an insatiable urge to somehow venture\
  \ on. But practicality and civilisation pull me back. Bitumen will reappear. And,\
  \ of course, quandong pie will once more abound."
