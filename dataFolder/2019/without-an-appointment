Text: "I\u2019ve heard that some people are magic, the air surrounding them are so\
  \ in awe to be around someone magical that it starts convincing others of their\
  \ charm.\n I came out of \u2018Rabindrasadan\u2019 metro station along with my younger\
  \ brother and maternal uncle whom I call \u2018Raja-mama\u2019. I still couldn\u2019\
  t believe that Raja mama finally agreed to fulfil this wish of mine of coming here,\
  \ which to him was kind of absurd, I was still thinking of the posters of Rabindranath\
  \ Tagore along with his Noble prize winning poem Gitanjali, then suddenly I got\
  \ out of the metro station with one of its outlets, climbing the staircase of the\
  \ outlets were usually difficult and that too when we have 6 pounds heavy backpack,\
  \ but adrenaline was rushing, and I was thinking that would all the hardships and\
  \ struggles I faced and made Raja mama face who already thinks of this as a bad\
  \ idea, would be worth it ? Would I be able to prove him wrong or make my younger\
  \ brother astonish?, with all these worries I never realised  when I climbed up\
  \ the steep staircase, and all of a sudden came a fresh pile of air, the cool breeze\
  \ which ran through the open and broad freeways of Rabindra Sadan, kissed on my\
  \ sweaty skin and said \u2018welcome\u2019, and I got a feeling that this is a not\
  \ like my world, this place was different, the roads were broader, the lights were\
  \ softer and the colours got sober and all of this together was saying me \u201C\
  \ this is not your boring dirty world, this is a world of art, this is place where\
  \ Satyajit Ray belongs to\u201D Satyajit Ray was an academy award filmmaker and\
  \ I always wanted to visit his house and see where he did incept.\nAnd finally after\
  \ coming out of the metro station, and after walking 20 good steps, we got to Bishop\
  \ Lefroy Road, Kolkata where Ray lived, the broader than usual lane had some big\
  \ hotels, some old big houses, all the houses were of the European architecture,\
  \ and were adjacent to long ox trees and I felt for a second that maybe British\
  \ colonization hasn\u2019t ended in India, it was too English to believe it as India,\
  \ we were walking towards the end of the Bishop Lefroy Road, with us was walking\
  \ all the glow signboards of the Satyajit Ray movie posters, I could feel the magic\
  \ of Satyajit Ray in the air, even though he died back in 1992, but the man had\
  \ worked so hard all his life and stayed true to himself , it still makes people\
  \ love and respect him even after decades he died.\nNow we finally reached his house\
  \ it was a big 3 storeyed European building built during British colonization, it\
  \ had pale yellow colour on itself, and had big black glass window panes, windows\
  \ as big as doors, and, those altogether were a feel of British cultural influence\
  \ on Bengal, the entrance was paved with pebbles and made noise if walked upon.\
  \ \nWe were now confronted by the guard who was sitting on a plastic chair, and\
  \ on being asked about the house and Ray he said \u201Cyes this is Satyajit Ray\u2019\
  s house, he lived 20 years of his life here, now his son and his wife and kids live\
  \ here\u201D\nI asked, \u201Cin this big house where do they exactly stay?\u201D\
  \nTo which he replied \u201Cnot this whole house he owns, he started to stay here\
  \ in rent, he got this house from a parse friend of him, one of the sections at\
  \ first was rented to him and later they stopped taking any rent, because of him\
  \ becoming so famous later, you people can go upstairs and meet his son, he meets\
  \ people at this time\u201D\nWe were overwhelmed with too much of information, but\
  \ as he said we didn\u2019t hear it wrong, we could meet his son and get into his\
  \ house and maybe see his Oscar trophy we got too excited, we were prohibited from\
  \ taking any pictures, as we pressed the bell, a middle-aged man in a Tee and shorts\
  \ asked \u201Cyes, Do you have an appointment?\u201D\n\nI said \"No\"."
