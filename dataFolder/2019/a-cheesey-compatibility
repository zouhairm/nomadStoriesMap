Text: "Before I embarked on my three week European backpacking adventure in May of\
  \ 2017, I had been in a period of depression for several years. The feeling dug\
  \ a deeper hole than mere unhappiness, thanks to a complete sense of isolation and\
  \ displacement wherever I went in life. I felt like I didn't really have a home\
  \ in Vancouver, despite growing up there. In my heart, there was always an underlying\
  \ feeling that I was searching for something, though I didn't know what that thing\
  \ was, and I would read books to avoid feeling like I was somehow incomplete. I\
  \ read novels upon novels about fictional places, alternate realities, and fantastical\
  \ worlds. To no one's surprise, I chose a major in English Literature in university.\
  \ Also, prior to my trip, I didn't eat any cheese. I hadn't included dairy as a\
  \ part of my diet for several years because my body decided at some point it couldn't\
  \ handle dairy. If I ate a sandwich with a slice of Havarti in it, my stomach would\
  \ immediately start roiling in protest. My lunch sandwiches became cheese-less,\
  \ and I had to specifically ask for NO CHEESE on my pizza or pasta at restaurants.\
  \ Cheesecake, my childhood all-time love, became a ticking diarrhea bomb. \n\nWhat\
  \ a life, right? I'm surprised I managed to maintain a sense of humor during all\
  \ that time. Perhaps it was unsurprising that in the months leading up to my trip\
  \ I began developing a sense that something I've spent all my life waiting for was\
  \ just out of reach. I was excited to see all the places I'd only ever read about\
  \ in my novels, but also began feeling an intense restless energy forming next to\
  \ my depression, as if it was trying to tug it forward.\n\nAfter living my bookworm's\
  \ fantasy in London for a few days, my friend and I arrived in France. I made a\
  \ silent pact with myself that I was going to eat cheese, even if it bloody killed\
  \ me (I tried to live like a character in my English novels when I was in London),\
  \ because there's no way I'm going to miss that experience. I would have rather\
  \ starved, which was probably what would have happened if I avoided eating cheese\
  \ in France. It was fortunate I had already mentally steeled myself to imbue my\
  \ bloodstream with its sworn enemy, because when we arrived at my friend's relatives'\
  \ home, the first thing her French aunt and uncle did was offer us a plate of cheese\
  \ and bread. The plate was about 80% cheese and the bread was crammed onto the side\
  \ like an afterthought. Out of trained instinct, my lactose-intolerant hackles rose.\n\
  \nIf I'm being honest, I was hesitant about being in France at first. Experiencing\
  \ London had been a smooth transition thanks to a lack of a language barrier, but\
  \ the moment I set foot in Paris, I immediately felt the cultural and linguistic\
  \ difference between me and, well, everything else. I secretly panicked about not\
  \ enjoying the few days we allotted for this iconic city. Yet, once I had a taste\
  \ of the sights and the culture, truly slowed down to savor being where I was, I\
  \ magically--finally--felt like I was home. The feeling was indescribable, like\
  \ the final click as the all the right squares finally lined up on a Rubik's cube.\n\
  \nSo, at the encouraging looks from two kind French strangers, I took that first\
  \ bite of cheese, enjoyed the damn heck out of it, and reached for many bites after\
  \ that. Perhaps it was unsurprising that, in the moments after polishing off several\
  \ hunks of cheese, I didn't feel bad at all."
