Text: "'Sambar' - a south Indian lentil and vegetable stew blended with tamarind;\
  \ spicy, delicious and certainly adding sugar to it will be a disaster. You must\
  \ be thinking why I am telling you this? Well, in this story I was either going\
  \ to be a well-blended vegetable or the sugar that doesn't belong in the sambar.\n\
  \nThe diversity of my country, India is not unknown to the world, and I am yet to\
  \ explore most of it. Born and brought up in the capital, I have travelled a lot\
  \ but lived only in Delhi (North India). I decided to go to a film school in Chennai-\
  \ Tamil Nadu (South India) and space were entirely different than mine. I was still\
  \ trying to adjust in Chennai, studying, making friends, soaking in the air, that\
  \ suddenly for a documentary project, I had to go to \"Nagercoil\", southern-most\
  \ part of the state. I don't know the local language and unaware of the local culture\
  \ and you should know that in the \u201CSouth of South India\u201D, people are a\
  \ bit particular of their language and culture.\n\nWe made all the necessary arrangements\
  \ for the shoot and I left with my team. Thankfully my team could arrange local\
  \ contacts to help us proceed with the shoot. But, I was depended upon my team and\
  \ the contacts for any communication. And, that was really hard for a talkative\
  \ person like me.\n\nOne day, my team left with a local contact to shoot at a location\
  \ and I was asked not to join because the place is dangerous for women so, I had\
  \ to stay back in the local contact's home. Along with me, there was just the grandma\
  \ (whom we call Patti), the maid, and a goldfish in the house. \n\nThe maid was\
  \ busy cooking as per grandma's instruction. \"Patti\" is in her 80's but still\
  \ a very jolly and positive person. She turned on the television for me but it was\
  \ useless as I couldn't understand a word. My attention went to the goldfish. I\
  \ walked to the tank, to observe her. I was still thinking about it and said: \"\
  what's her name?\"  and immediately I felt the \"oops\" feeling as I knew Patti\
  \ doesn't know English. But to my amazement, she promptly replied \"Misha\" and\
  \ from there began a very unusual conversation.\n\nI was talking in English and\
  \ Patti responded in Tamil, we understood each other's emotion, intention and story.\
  \ She told me about her daughter and that I resembled her granddaughter. She conveyed\
  \ that she regretted marrying early and wanted to make an identity of her own, rather\
  \ being known by her father or her husband's name. She has a keen interest in Tamil\
  \ literature and is not very fond of movies, except the one starring Kamal Hassan-an\
  \ Indian actor, because she finds him attractive.\n\nShe called me a brave girl\
  \ for working at par with the boys. She asked my story, and without hesitation,\
  \ I expressed my feelings to her, I felt being me. We connected without common words.\
  \ We connected by emotions. I told her that I felt like a misfit and she replied:\
  \ \"The world is made by all misfits coming together, the way sambar is made with\
  \ lentil and drumsticks coming together\".\n\nShe bid me adieu by giving me a tamarind\
  \ candy, which tasted sweet and salty as it melted in my mouth. It was like revisiting\
  \ childhood. They say it right \"The world is a global village\". I left for the\
  \ railway station realizing that I am perhaps the tamarind in the sambar, giving\
  \ it, it's final flavour."
