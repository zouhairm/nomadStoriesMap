Text: "She can\u2018t remember when it started. Maybe it has never started and never...ended.\
  \ It just was, from the very beginning. Pictures of imagined journeys under her\
  \ eyelids were more real than reality she lived in. But she was trapped. In everything\
  \ one can get trapped \u2013 people, places, thoughts, memories and most of all\
  \ in a tiny soviet apartment. Regularly, she would think how she was wasting the\
  \ time here. Man, the world is so big and she was choosing so little. One day, the\
  \ fear that she was missing something really important made her leave.\nAnd here\
  \ she was - crying alone in a hostel all soaked in sweat in Bucharest. \nShe was\
  \ looking at her shadow with a big backpack realizing she was becoming a person\
  \ she always dreamed to become. She was meditating in silence. Giggling half asleep\
  \ while listening to a meditator in another bunk bed having a nightmare and screaming\
  \ \u201Ecarrot\u201C (she couldn\u2018t understand what\u2018s so scary about carrots).\
  \ She was trying hard not to laugh in the meditation hall when some tired guy started\
  \ to snore. There she was, giving scissors to anyone who would find cutting the\
  \ hair short funny. \nShe was crying in her bed, scared of people she didn\u2018\
  t know. \nShe was thumbing up in the middle of Transylvania, suddenly trusting people\
  \ she didn\u2018t know. She was helping a Romanian family to build a house from\
  \ clay and straw. She was putting love in every handful of clay she plastered the\
  \ walls with. She was getting familiar with morning steps downstairs meaning that\
  \ she would have fresh milk for the coffee and warm bread for a sandwich. She was\
  \ smelling the whispering pines while holding tight in the back of a fast pickup\
  \ truck. \nShe was crying when leaving that never-going-to-be-finished clay house\
  \ because she was accepted there, silent and shy \u2013 not a typical traveler.\
  \ Scared of her own power as one shaman said.\nShe was in Sierra Nevada cantering\
  \ through a December which smelled of wild rosemary. She was running down the olive\
  \ trees farms to steal some oranges for a midnight cake. Every night she was saying\
  \ goodbye to her dearest companion - the moon. She was hungry so she went to a farmers\
  \ market in Rome to get something from tastings, acting perfectly that she was considering\
  \ to buy it. \nShe was daring to be happy. She was falling down from a horse, hitting\
  \ the ground. She was all drained to the bone from rain while feeding the same horse.\
  \ She was spinning a globe-lamp choosing the next place to go to. She found herself\
  \ missing that tiny apartment she shared with a boy she loved. So maybe it has never\
  \ started and never...ended.\nI am writing this story and I didn\u2018t expect to\
  \ find out that this girl is me. A girl who sleeps."
