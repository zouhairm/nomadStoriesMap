Text: "The irate buffalo, having torn up a stone wall, focused its steely gaze on\
  \ me.  Thronged by excitable Indonesians as I was, members of the crowd in front\
  \ of me sprinted away in blind panic.  As the sonorously snorting buffalo bared\
  \ down on me, first I felt, then looked down, to see a swarm of hands confidently\
  \ grasping every vaguely interesting part of me, and felt yet more grab each buttock!\
  \  Under the circumstances, and luckily for the guys who were all shorter than me,\
  \ I had no time to react before the rampaging buffalo was upon us.  Then they were\
  \ gone: like magic, all hands vanished as the surrounding men scattered in all directions.\
  \  With fight or flight fully activated, I too fled from the highly vexed beast,\
  \ rather than be gored or trampled.\n\nThe fact that I was at a funeral made this\
  \ gang groping incident all the more bizarre.  I was honoured to have been invited\
  \ to a Torajan funeral in Indonesia: a lively event, held at a village a short distance\
  \ from Rantepao, capital of North Toraja.  Tana Toraja, a majestic mountainous regency\
  \ in South Sulawesi, is home to the Toraja (people of the uplands), an ethnic group\
  \ indigenous to that region, who for centuries have practiced the most complex and\
  \ elaborate funeral rites in the world. Their funerals are significant social occasions,\
  \ lasting days and attended by hundreds of people.  Torajans, believing that their\
  \ ancestors descended from heaven, that death and life are closely intertwined,\
  \ equally important parts of our spiritual journey, hold lavish funerals resembling\
  \ a large going-away party to celebrate the deceased\u2019s life.  Families will\
  \ often keep the embalmed, mummified corpses of their departed at home for years.\
  \  They treat them with great respect, include them in many familial activities\
  \ and attend to them daily by cleaning, dressing and symbolically feeding them.\
  \   This practice allows the family time to accumulate enough wealth for a good\
  \ send-off, until which time they consider their deceased to be merely sick, or\
  \ sleeping.  They believe their spirit remains and takes care of them, their soul\
  \ residing in the village until the funeral\u2019s completion, at which time they\
  \ continue on their journey toward puya, the afterlife and realm of the souls. To\
  \ the Torajans, water buffalo are seen as more valuable than money.  Received as\
  \ gifts from guests, they are ritually slaughtered during the death feast, to accompany\
  \ the spirit of their family member into puya.  The meat is then distributed amongst\
  \ family, guests (according to their position within the community) and the deceased.\n\
  \nI attended the funeral of a doctor.  Held in high status, he warranted the slaying\
  \ of fifty buffalos and countless pigs.  For days preceding their slaughter, pigs\
  \ were carried amongst the crowd, hanging belly-up, bound to a pole by their legs.\
  \  Kicked violently at regular intervals, the animals elicited a cacophony of terrified\
  \ squealing.   Both pigs and buffalos are slaughtered by a machete to the throat\
  \ in the climax to the elaborate death feast: their sacrifice and the spilling of\
  \ their blood onto the earth is considered sacred.  Choosing not to attend the slaughtering\
  \ of the water buffalo, I was later shown gory footage of it.  With throats cut,\
  \ they charged through the crowd, scattering the fleeing guests. \n\nI followed\
  \ as the body was jubilantly carried in a portable tongkanan (a traditional house,\
  \ at the centre of Torajan social life, representing ancestral links, with an acutely\
  \ sloped upward-sweeping roof), supported on bamboo poles by a throng of chanting\
  \ men to the burial site situated in a cave, carved out of a steep cliff-face. \
  \ An effigy of the deceased was placed at the entrance to the cave, from where he\
  \ looks out over the land.\n\nIn hindsight, I wonder how my gang gropers managed\
  \ to synchronise their actions so precisely: collective consciousness; flash mob\
  \ mentality?   They presumably saw this part of the funeral proceedings as the perfect\
  \ opportunity for a good grope, caught up in the general revelry of this celebratory\
  \ event.  Thankfully on more recent visits to Indonesia, just over twenty years\
  \ later, I am afforded far more respect, presumably due to my more advanced age\
  \ and their respect of elders."
