Text: "When you grow up in one of the tiniest towns in America, you almost forget\
  \ that there is a larger world outside of this one. You make your way through high\
  \ school thinking you'll do all the traditional things like go to a local university,\
  \ graduate, get a job, and eventually start a family. But that's not how this story\
  \ goes. I did graduate High School and I did go to a local college but then one\
  \ day, everything changed. I had visited Ireland one time before I decided I would\
  \ move there. Suddenly, my tiny town in New Jersey, became so much smaller as I\
  \ moved my life across the Atlantic Ocean. \nGalway, Ireland became my new home.\
  \ I was captivated by the colorful stores that lined Shop street and the buskers\
  \ that crowded the streets playing all different genres of music. Some were better\
  \ than others but that didn't matter to them. As I watched people play their favorite\
  \ instrument or sing their favorite song or jam out with their friends I could just\
  \ tell that they weren't doing this for any other reason than pure joy. I had never\
  \ been to a place where small musical groups playing on the street was a social\
  \ norm. I was hooked on this city from the second I stepped foot in it. I heard\
  \ a band playing on the street that caught my attention. As I walked down the street\
  \ I heard the blaring of a saxophone, the intensity of the violin, hands slapping\
  \ the Cajon, and a jumble of voices singing. I went to see that band play a gig\
  \ that night. They put on a great show and everyone was dancing and having a good\
  \ time. I still see them on Shop street from time to time, I also still go to their\
  \ gigs every once in a while too. They never wander too far from their home. \n\
  Due to the fact that I was in Ireland, I knew I was going to have to delve deeper\
  \ into this country. One of my favorite places I've been to so far is the Cliffs\
  \ of Moher. I walked off the bus and followed the groups of people heading towards\
  \ the edge of the cliffs. The grass was a vibrant green and as I looked down, the\
  \ ocean was violently smashing into the cliffs, as if it were angry these beautiful\
  \ cliffs were disrupting the peaceful flow of the ocean. It was easy to lose time\
  \ looking out into the distance and seeing miles and miles of different shades of\
  \ blue. The air was cleaner and I took a lot of deep breathes standing on those\
  \ cliffs. I turned away from the view of the ocean and then suddenly I was looking\
  \ at miles and miles of different shades of green. It was equally as beautiful.\
  \ People passed me and I heard all kinds of ethnicities taking in the draw- dropping\
  \ scenery. I listened to French, Chinese, Australians all looking at the same thing\
  \ as me, all interpreting the view differently. I'll admit I was nervous to go too\
  \ close to the very edge of the cliffs like some people did. But I knew I was seeing\
  \ the same breathtaking beauty as they were. It's funny how when you see something\
  \ new and beautiful your mind kind of shuts off. I felt completely at peace as I\
  \ stood there and looked around. The winds whips fiercely around you as you stand\
  \ there, it disrupts the peace a little but the view is worth it. \nIt was easy\
  \ for me to fall in love with Ireland. The people are incredibly kind, there's music\
  \ playing at every hour of the day, and the images of the small city of Galway never\
  \ get old. My world has become so much bigger because I moved here. You never expect\
  \ these kind of adventures to happen to you which makes it so much sweeter when\
  \ they actually do. My tiny town turned into a tiny city, but my world isn't so\
  \ tiny anymore."
