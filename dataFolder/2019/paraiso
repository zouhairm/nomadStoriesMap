Text: "Paraiso means paradise.\n\nI think about that when I\u2019m here. A place I\
  \ often hide in Morrumbala. I skulk in with my backpack slung across my shoulders,\
  \ looking behind to see who watches as I enter. \n\nI pick the table in the back\
  \ left corner, or sometimes, the upper right corner by the small 8 inch TV. That\u2019\
  s where Victoria and I used to sit. If I was with her, or friend just passing through,\
  \ we\u2019d immediately sit and order 2 plates of the \"caril de galinha\" and \"\
  xima\". Alone, now, I walk up to the front and smile gently, expectantly, at the\
  \ older man that works here. He\u2019s about a foot shorter than me, and always\
  \ notices when I\u2019m away for a while. Our conversations begin with him asking\
  \ where I\u2019ve been. A soft place to land. \n\nI order an \"impala de mandioca\"\
  ...and wait in vain to carry it away with me to the table. Here in Mozambique it's\
  \ critical that he puts it on a silver tray, fumbles with a glass, and carries it\
  \ for me to the table. I sit. \n\nThe  tablecloths are faded old plastic, of the\
  \ \"Manica\" brand beer. They are sticky and  come with a few resident flies. The\
  \ cats only bother to come by if you order some chicken. Sometimes I bring my computer\
  \ and \u201Cwork\u201D. Other times, I talk on the phone. Or I sit and wait til\
  \ someone that knows me comes by and wants to chat...playing that game of asking\
  \ me to buy a beer but mostly just paying for mine. \n\nThe place is set up like\
  \ this: low cement walls that wind around at waist height, separating into four\
  \ sections. They are painting a garish red, coca cola red...donated from the company\
  \ to bars in Africa that promise to splash the logo all over. Some of the chairs\
  \ are kelly green with bits of wood showing through. Others are a faded red or unpainted.\
  \ A hodgepodge of items thrown together in a strangely appealing way. Part of the\
  \ roof is comprised of thick vines, decorated with green leaves and plastic banners\
  \ advertising outdated prices. The rest is \u201Cchapa\u201D, or corrugated tin.\
  \ \n\nI don\u2019t know why I feel so comfortable here. Maybe because this place\
  \ has always felt like mine. I hadn\u2019t heard of it. No ghosts of Americans past\
  \ or present. The first time I came here was with Hope, Grace, and Will. They\u2019\
  d made the trek out to spend birthdays, and after laying terribly hungover all day\
  \ on my kitchen floor with the kids banging at the door, we'd made our escape. Necessity\
  \ drove us away from the fan and safety of my closed up house. Grilled chicken,\
  \ salad, and french fries. What a day it was. \n\nMy visits to paraiso are now much\
  \ more demure. I arrive alone, order my two or three beers, and leave again. I don\u2019\
  t like to eat alone. \n\nThere\u2019s no one in this town that I can go out with\
  \ these days. Matias and Victoria left months ago, my female friends don\u2019t\
  \ drink and are constantly short on money. That\u2019s why I always end up here.\
  \ It\u2019s my spot. I don\u2019t need to show up with anyone, leave with anyone.\
  \ I don\u2019t feel awkward or ashamed, just being me. I guess you could say it\u2019\
  s paraiso."
