Text: "Sitting at STC (Intercity) park Abidjan, C\xF4te d\u2019Ivoire. Tears rolling\
  \ down my cheek, mucus failing at an attempt to disgrace me, as the last thing I\
  \ care right about now is my appearance!\n\nI had my return trip all planned out\
  \ in my head. Get a fairly cheap ticket to Accra. I won't bother much on which airline,\
  \ as long as it gets me to Accra, we are good. Then, make sure it\u2019s a window\
  \ seat that would give me the view of the cloud beneath me. You know how power surges\
  \ within you when you feel nature a little less powerful than you always know it?\
  \ Imagine the cloud beneath me! Won\u2019t that be exhilarating! I\u2019m used to\
  \ them always being above. One reason I love to fly!\n\nMy plans turned to ashes,\
  \ when my credit card refused to fulfill it\u2019s primary use in a foreign land.\
  \ I was shattered at the thought of having to use road to Accra. I\u2019ve heard\
  \ stories of how long the road is, 10 - 12 hours! To a lot of people, that is not\
  \ far. But to me, it\u2019s heaven to hell, then back to heaven. I\u2019ve always\
  \ hated road journey, maybe because of the terrible road network in my country.\
  \ \n\nI honestly think there's a big difference between \u201Croad journey\u201D\
  \ and \u201Croad trip\". Road journey is the type you endeavor with strange faces\
  \ who probably can\u2019t afford to fly, has a phobia for flying or couldn't get\
  \ a ticket on time.\nNow, road trip! This is the type I rally up my squad, pick\
  \ out a ride, fill up the tank, make a quick stop at the grocery store, use a map\
  \ if necessary, And zoom off to wherever it is our heart and our map leads us. The\
  \ anticipation alone of planning a road trip is exciting, unlike a road journey,\
  \ where you have to be at the park early enough to get a good bus that might still\
  \ break down somewhere in the middle of nowhere! You worry to death about who you\u2019\
  re going to be pitied against as seat mates. You try to mind your business all through\
  \ the journey, yet you can't, because the driver suddenly turns off the AC when\
  \ the day is at the hottest, or starts playing his noise of a music so loud your\
  \ eardrums want to burst! It's unbearable!\nRoad trip with friends are memorable.\
  \ The switch driving, the beautiful CDs already picked out the night before, the\
  \ wine, the food, the conversation, the stopovers, the photo shoots at amazing scenarios.\
  \ Believe me, you wouldn\u2019t want the journey to end.\n\nBack to my life right\
  \ now! It wasn\u2019t enough that I had to go by road, getting barely 3 hours of\
  \ sleep as I had to pack late into the morning, and still \nwake up on time to meet\
  \ the first bus. Here I am, sitting in the most unfamiliar place, tears running\
  \ down my cheek. Don\u2019t think I\u2019m a big baby weeping at final goodbyes\
  \ from loved ones. The heck No! It\u2019s not even close to that.\nI have just been\
  \ robbed..yes! I can't find my phone\n\n\"Excusez-moi, did you see my phone\"\n\
  He turned to me, looked straight in my eyes and responded, \"Your French is terrible\"\
  .\nWhat in Pete's sake?! I'm here not knowing the next step from where I'm sitting,\
  \ and I have a Linguist criticizing my French. I was too stunned to say anything,\
  \ I stood up, made to walk away and  the same voice spoke again, \"le bus est sur\
  \ le point de partir\" . I didn't have to use a Google translate to understand what\
  \ he said. I turned around, smiled and walked off.\nI walked steadily till I got\
  \ outside the park gate, flagged down the first taxi I saw, praying deep within\
  \ me that the driver would understand English. \nNext stop; a supermarch\xE9! I\
  \ bought all the snacks my belly could take, a Stromae CD, a bottle of sweet wine,\
  \ soda for my chauffeur, as I started out on the best road trip I've ever had! I\
  \ never wanted the journey to end. I found a travel buddy in the most unlikely situation."
