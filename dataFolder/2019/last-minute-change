Text: "Myself and three girls climbed down from the roof of the minivan, the rest\
  \ went through the safety of a door from the comfort of seats. The drive to the\
  \ lake took longer than expected, upon staring at the towering mountain above us,\
  \ we could see why. We weren\u2019t going to walk around a lake near the village\
  \ of Llupa where we were staying, we were about to spend 6 hours hiking up and down\
  \ the Cordillera Blanca mountain range, with a big packet of cheetos between 9 people.\
  \ \nWe weren\u2019t prepared. This was the closest we\u2019d all been to a mountain\
  \ and now we were expected to climb it, were we strong enough to do it? Or were\
  \ we stupid enough to even try?\nHowever, we didn\u2019t even think twice, and within\
  \ moments we were on route. Our guide was a local whose English was very weak, so\
  \ our translator Sharon was our link, directing us on which path to take, and when\
  \ to have short breaks to gather well needed strength. You never truly believe how\
  \ insignificant and small you are, until you stare at a mountain range sweeping\
  \ across your view into the horizon, engulfing the landscape and your presence within\
  \ it. \nThe terrain changed throughout our sojourn; natural stone pathways through\
  \ grassland to ease us into the ascend, our backs faced the extensive emptiness\
  \ till the next mountain; the muddy trail trimmed the edges, weaving and warping\
  \ through the mountains curves, only a small wired fence between us and a hasty\
  \ descend; native trees dangled over ledges, lemon coloured flowers which followed\
  \ us all the way up blended with long wild khaki coloured grass, and a jagged cliffside\
  \ greeted us at our last obstacle, the waterfall. \nIt wasn\u2019t very wide, but\
  \ the water rushed down the mountainside eagerly before it hit the small pool at\
  \ the bottom. To our left, a passage created for hikers, equipped with rubber cable\
  \ and rope to help people up and then back down. To the right, next to the waterfall,\
  \ the path our guide took us up. The \u2018easier\u2019 way. \nHalfway on our climb,\
  \ I\u2019m faced with my fear. In front of me stands a rock, just like the ones\
  \ we had climbed for 10 or so minutes, but this one was bigger than me, getting\
  \ up would be very challenging - but doable - getting down would be near impossible.\
  \ My heart pounded in my chest, my hands quivered, and my eyes began to lose focus.\
  \ I knew I shouldn\u2019t have, but I was reminding myself that one loose stone,\
  \ one misstep, and I join the water below. \nHowever, because dying here in the\
  \ Andes was something I had already acknowledged long before I got on the plane,\
  \ I had said my goodbyes to those I loved, I had done what most movie characters\
  \ miss out on, and so if death arrived, I was fully prepared. With that comfort\
  \ I continued, and as a hand reached towards my swollen fingers to haul me up and\
  \ over, I was met with the indigo flickers of Laguna Churup.\nThe grey stones of\
  \ Mt Churup reflected in its turquoise and teal water, and moss coated the bottom\
  \ adding hues of deep green. I felt like this was a pathway to the heavens, with\
  \ the snow blending the mountain top with the clouds, the beautiful colours of the\
  \ lake beside me, and the rugged scenery behind. \nI look back at the picture of\
  \ us we took, with our hands reaching the stars that we looked upon each night,\
  \ and our smiles as bright as when the sun reflected off the snow. I remember that\
  \ leap into unknown territory we all took, and how it brought us all closer, but\
  \ mostly, brought us closer to ourselves."
