Text: "The myth about the Tower of Babel made a deep and lasting impression on me\
  \ in my early childhood. And I thought what a wonderful place it would be to explore\
  \ the world in its incredible diversity. I really wanted to meet the whole planet\
  \ gathered in one area, to know how it feels when you hear so many languages at\
  \ the same time, and finally to see all the people the way they are. It was my dream,\
  \ a crazy dream, which I made come true.\n \nBeing a bilingual girl, a second-generation\
  \ immigrant, who grew up in the Urals (Russia), place where Europe meets Asia, I\
  \ was always keen on cultural diversity. And the older I got, the deeper was the\
  \ interest to the unknown, different and foreign. Therefore, when I got a chance\
  \ to make an acquaintance with the whole world, I did my best in order not to miss\
  \ the most important meeting of my life.\n\nThe way to my dream brought me to Sochi,\
  \ the host city of the XIX World Festival of Youth and Students (WFYS). I was on\
  \ the top of the sky when I found my name in the list of the accepted applicants\
  \ of this fest. But I couldn\u2019t control my emotions at the same time, because\
  \ I was unable to imagine the picture, which I was going to see, the real Tower\
  \ of Babel. I was afraid of being disappointed, so I made a decision to have no\
  \ expectations of coming adventure. It was a breathtaking leap into the unknown.\
  \     \n\nNow as the time passed I can say that I became an evident of the ideal\
  \ version of the world, probably, I\u2019ve seen so-called Paradise. It was a beautiful\
  \ mirage, which disappeared bringing me back to reality, but leaving me powerful\
  \ memories.\n\nThose 9 days of the fest were blissful. My cheeks hurt from smiling\
  \ so much. The picture I looked at was so admirable. People, whose countries have\
  \ strained relations, smiled sincerely at one another. At that time I realised it\u2019\
  s possible to create a world, where there\u2019s no place for wars. Sounds naive,\
  \ doesn\u2019t it? But when you\u2019re in an illusion, you can\u2019t or don\u2019\
  t have a wish to believe that everything you see is your mind\u2019s trick. You\
  \ prefer to think it\u2019s a magic.\n\nActually, this festival was a kind of magic.\
  \ Once you marvelled at graceful argentinian dancers, then you could take just one\
  \ single step to suddenly appear in real Oriental bazaar, kept moving on you made\
  \ an acquaintance with an amazing indonesian girl, whom you started teaching russian\
  \ language. It was my \u201Cdaily routine\u201D at the festival: travelling from\
  \ one corner of the planet to another without making any effort, meeting exciting\
  \ people and just enjoying the crazy spirit of the fest. \n\nWhen I was preparing\
  \ for this trip, I thought I would mostly be attracted by foreign countries (and\
  \ actually I did), but then surprisingly I found out that I was more astonished\
  \ by cultures of those people, whom I see daily, the immigrants. Even being a creative\
  \ person I could never imagine how bright and fun they are, when they feel like\
  \ home. I was taught to dance their national dances, I tried their ethnic cuisine\
  \ and learned few words from their languages. It was so amazing to see their shining\
  \ eyes and to realize that incredible people surround us everywhere.   \n  \nThis\
  \ journey helped me to brick down all the stereotypes I used to have. It proved\
  \ me one more time that you should never judge a whole nation/country by a behavior\
  \ of one person. To understand people you have to look and see what\u2019s in their\
  \ hearts. That\u2019s the only thing which matters.\n\nComing back to reality after\
  \ seeing a Paradise was the most difficult thing. Despite the fact that according\
  \ to the myth God confused the language of all the planet, so people could no longer\
  \ understand one another, I believe we could create a world, where \u201Cthe whole\
  \ earth was of one language, and of one speech\u201D."
