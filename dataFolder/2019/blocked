Text: "- \"Pare! Where you going?! Pull over, agora! You're not crossing the blockade!\"\
  \ we're stopped by a group of angry truckers soon after we leave Rio. \n- \"I just\
  \ need to see my friend who's running out of supplies on the other end. I am not\
  \ going to cross the blockade,\" says Luis, our driver, calmly.\n- \"I don't give\
  \ a fuck! He has to vir aqui! You're not going anywhere!\" they demand.\n\nSomehow,\
  \ the man persuades this bunch of his good intentions. But there are another four\
  \ kilometers of the blockade, and we are stopped every few hundred meters \"Pare!\"\
  . Luis calmly repeats the same thing he said to the other men before, but this one\
  \ wouldn't listen - \"Pare agora mesmo, fiho da puta!\" - the man's eyes start filling\
  \ with blood, and a hand reaches for a gun. \"Please, just stop somewhere!\" - I'm\
  \ begging our driver in my mind. \n\nThe night before leaving Rio de Janeiro my\
  \ husband Mika and I learn that truckers went on a strike over gasoline prices and\
  \ blocked major roads throughout Brazil. This caused a massive disruption because\
  \ the country relies on trucks to transport everything - from food to fuel making\
  \ it difficult to hitchhike. But Mika has to be back home in Brasilia, a thousand\
  \ kilometers away, in a week to give a presentation about his travels. We don't\
  \ have a choice except to trust the gods of hitchhiking and kindness of the few\
  \ drivers left on the road. \n\nAfter several local rides, we get out of Rio and\
  \ eventually find a truck who isn't on strike (yet). He's is going where we want\
  \ to arrive today. Naive of him. Soon we're stopped by a group of enraged truckers.\
  \ But Luis convinces all of them to let him get to his friend. \"How?!\" - \"I simply\
  \ knew what I was doing, and I knew it was justo.\" Unbelievable! It's like in those\
  \ movies - a cool cop calmly facing down an angry or scared young man pointing a\
  \ gun at the cop. \"Voce just need to confiar yourself.\" Just trust yourself...\n\
  \nLuis and his friend share their food and \"home\" giving us some space in the\
  \ cargo compartment where we set camp for the night. However, there's one issue\
  \ - I'm the only female among a mob of angry truckers, so I'm afraid to go pee.\
  \ But our driver being a protective host reassures \"We won't let them hurt ela,\"\
  \ pointing to his machete, \"And I also have alguma coisa in case this isn't enough,\"\
  \ implying a gun. \n\nYes, just about every trucker carries a gun because they're\
  \ often robbed. That's why they're not allowed to give rides and have trackers indicating\
  \ a passenger in the car. But those who want to help travelers find a way to trick\
  \ the system, risking their jobs and even lives. Hitchhiking in Brazil is quite\
  \ challenging - people don't trust strangers. Nevertheless, sometimes after we nearly\
  \ begged for the ride, the drivers would hold back tears when goodbying. \n\nAlong\
  \ our way, we have encountered so many helpful and kind people - they trusted to\
  \ let us in their homes, they cooked for us, both they and we shed tears when leaving.\
  \ After all this kindness, we wanted to pay back to the world somehow.\n\nAnd the\
  \ opportunity presents itself the morning after we arrived home. A shabby-looking\
  \ man with the skin revealing that he works a lot in the sun rings the doorbell\
  \ asking for a bag and some food. He says he knows Mika's grandmother who's out\
  \ for some time. We decide to do something Mika would never have thought of before\
  \ this journey. We invite him to sit with us for breakfast and ask to get some bread\
  \ with our money. Not only he comes back with the bread, but also gives back the\
  \ change. He was very humble and almost didn't speak, and we were shy to ask his\
  \ story watching him being clumsy with the fork and knife. The man was very grateful\
  \ for the breakfast and sandwiches we give him for lunch. And we feel like this\
  \ is the smallest but not the last thing we could do to give back what we received\
  \ from the world."
