Text: "How does it feel to walk on something that makes you feel like a drop in Ocean?\
  \ Something so magnificent & gigantic, that makes you shiver yet you adore its beauty.\
  \ Ladakh, India has been considered to be the most exquisite place, loaded with\
  \ travelers hailing from different countries. But what makes it different from other\
  \ snow capped mountain region? And why do people in huge number flock to it, why\
  \ they have Ladakh in their bucket list? I\u2019m a traveler & no wonder I\u2019\
  ve always had Ladakh in my bucket list since a long time, its is only during last\
  \ winter season when i was able to discover the diversity of this place. Traveling\
  \ on the World\u2019s Highest Motorable Road, can you imagine the feeling of privilege?\
  \ Not many people do so, especially when you are traveling in a season when it\u2019\
  s extremely cold, temperature sinking below 0 degree. To my travel mate & I this\
  \ was the best time to travel & explore Ladakh when the crowd is less, but was the\
  \ decision right or we were committing a huge blunder? We landed in the Kushok Bakula\
  \ Rimpochee Airport (Leh, India), the very first thing that we felt was extreme\
  \ cold, we were freezing but wait we are travelers & it\u2019s no fun traveling\
  \ until it gets hard, we boarded a taxi from Leh to Nubra Valley, they say Ladakh\
  \ has a lot to offer to a traveler, you would see different vegetation in different\
  \ parts, some places dry & the very moment you consider that Ladakh is mainly a\
  \ dry land with desert soil, you get to see Snow & not just Snow, the amount of\
  \ snow that you gonna witness is out of imagination. So while traveling from Leh\
  \ to Nubra Valley we had to cross the Highest Motorable Road in the world \u201C\
  The Khardung La\u201D. I still feel tremors when i say \u201CThe Khardung La\u201D\
  , why? You will get to know it very soon. So the journey so far was fabulous, we\
  \ enjoyed every ounce of it, after a tiring journey of 5-8 hours we reached Nubra\
  \ Valley that is situated in slightly lower altitude, after spending few days in\
  \ Nubra Valley when we decided to travel back to Leh to spend a few days over there,\
  \ something scary happened. How does it feel to be Reborn? Yes, because when i say\
  \ that, sitting here in my bedroom thinking of another getaway I really thank god\
  \ for showing merci that very day. While coming back from Nubra Valley to Leh, we\
  \ were to cross \u201CKhardung La\u201D yet again. Everything was rainbow & unicorns\
  \ but then this happened, it was snowing heavily that day, the entire road was covered\
  \ with fresh snow which was enormous, Khardung La is mountain that\u2019s situated\
  \ in a high altitude & it snows almost every time of the year, we couldn\u2019t\
  \ have imagined something like this would happen, and how we would live up to this\
  \ nightmare. The snow being fresh our car went off track since the road became too\
  \ slippery, all i could see was we going towards our end, falling off the cliff?\
  \ The only thought that i had in that very moment was how would my parents feel?\
  \ Will it be my last journey? I was traveling with the person i loved the most,\
  \ holding his hand tightly I shrieked. What happened then? Obviously I\u2019m alive\
  \ & so is my partner, and since then we have traveled many different places, hadn\u2019\
  t been for that Ladakhi driver whose presence of mind & quick reaction saved so\
  \ many lives present. And hadn\u2019t been for that Gigantic & the most beautiful\
  \ mountain, hadn\u2019t it shown merci to us, we would have met our end. Being a\
  \ traveler comes with a price, a lot of risk is involved but nothing worth having\
  \ comes easy, you crave more of it that is hard to achieve, well i cried a lot that\
  \ day difficult to believe I\u2019m alive, but it was God\u2019s way of telling\
  \ me that life is precious appreciate every moment and travel with care, but this\
  \ dint stop me from traveling & exploring. Life is short, live it, explore places,\
  \ it\u2019ll be worth it, because it will liberate you."
