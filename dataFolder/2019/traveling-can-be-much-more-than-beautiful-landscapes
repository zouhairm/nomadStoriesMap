Text: "This isn't a story about incredible things that happen only once in a lifetime.\
  \ No. This is actually a story about connecting to others through traveling - and\
  \ making a trip unforgettable, not because of amazing landscapes but because of\
  \ memorable people.\n\nIn the beggining of 2018, I was traveling around Australia\
  \ with my boyfriend. We ended up in a small town in New South Wales called Mondrook.\
  \ There, we stayed in a local's house. \n\nWe didn't have big expectations about\
  \ this particular trip. The area seemed interesting because of the beautiful nature\
  \ around (as it is almost everywhere in Australia), but that was all. We didn't\
  \ really know what to expect. \n\nHowever, we had a great surprise: The hosts! They\
  \ were incredible! They really welcomed us as we were family since the moment we\
  \ put our feet inside their living room.  \n\nDuring the days, me and my boyfriend\
  \ would visit the surrondings - the hosts also gave us amazing tips about what to\
  \ visit in the area. And at night, we would just sit at their terrace table, get\
  \ along, have dinner and share our experiences.\n\nWe stayed in their house for\
  \ only 4 days but when I think about it, it feels like a lifetime. Maybe they saw\
  \ on us their kids who doesn't live close to them anymore and just come for short\
  \ visits once in a while. Or maybe they reminded us of our parents, who we didn't\
  \ see since the trip started a few months back. \n\nDee made us barbecue and taught\
  \ me her secret salad recipies and sauces. Roger took us on a tricycle ride (but\
  \ not before assuring us it was really safe and he had never been in an accident\
  \ in over 50 years). \n\nI had never connected that much to any local people before.\
  \ Dee and Roger taught me a new way of traveling. Nowadays I am always excited to\
  \ stay at a local's house and get to know them. \n\nDee and Roger made my trip to\
  \ Monrook truly unforgettable! I wish I will go back to Australia and visit them\
  \ again in the future."
