Text: "It was the day to meet The Ultimate, The Magical and The Mesmerizing...! The\
  \ Katas Raj Temples also are known as Qila Katas is a complex of Hindu community,\
  \ temples connected by walkways to each other. The temple surrounds a pond named\
  \ \u201CKatas\u201D which is known as sacred by Hindus. The complex is located in\
  \ the Potohar Plateau region of Pakistan's Punjab province. The temples are located\
  \ near the town of Kallar Kahar which is also a spectacular place to visit with\
  \ its own unique beauty and are near to the M2 Motorway.\nSo here it was a brief\
  \ history about my trip and I hope it made you excited already and why not?\nIt\u2019\
  s has got all the right ingredients to burst one\u2019s mind and its mind-blowing\
  \ beauty yet to be explored. Let\u2019s dive into the unknown yet mesmerizing to\
  \ be!\nDuring my visit, I was cherishing each and every single moment as it was\
  \ drawing near and I always wanted to visit this majestic historical piece and fortunate\
  \ enough to be part of this rich land full of nature, art and unbelievable places\
  \ to visit. I was traveling through the motorway M2 (Islamabad) followed by the\
  \ peaceful breeze and silent drive which added in the beauty to my ever desired\
  \ trip... \nQila Katas it is, finally, what a great time to be alive...! The moment\
  \ I stepped in, an unusual feeling just caught me which was truly expected ... The\
  \ aura of it just indulged me in the divine beauty of the sacred blue lake also\
  \ known as God\u2019s tear which has a divine story behind it and it says like this\
  \ \u201CAccording to Hindu Beliefs, the pond of the temples\u2019 was created from\
  \ Shiva\u2019s teardrops...!\u201D\nThe echo of the blue to aquamarine waters stunned\
  \ me as I was lost in the eternal moment of this beauty and I shall never regret\
  \ my single step traveled ... The building and surroundings were all just perfect\
  \ and giving the total eye-catching view that one can't get his eyes off\u2026 Furthermore,\
  \ the temple is surrounded by 7 other temples also which is quite relatable for\
  \ the Hindu community. The Hindu population living in Pakistan as well as from India\
  \ visits these temples throughout the year.\nThe thing about this travel that made\
  \ me curious and even more wanted was the history behind it and its compelling story\
  \ which is so heartwarming and more of a fantasy story of some romance novel which\
  \ I am a big fan of ... and let me share a little bit about it too as It is related\
  \ that at the death of Shiva\u2019s wife Sati, he was inconsolable and cried so\
  \ much that it resulted in two pools of water one at Puskara near Ajmer in India\
  \ and other at Katas where I am right now. Isn\u2019t that heart touching or heartfelt\
  \ to the core?\nI always love to find these stories heartening and none the less\
  \ experienced was even more enchanting ... It gives me great pleasure to find experience\
  \ and write about these really enchanting yet true compelling stories from the history\
  \ or anywhere in the corner of the world and my journey of penning down these heart\
  \ touching stories will continue. \nOn our way back we went to Islamabad through\
  \ Chakwal Jhelum road. On our way home we passed small cities and there were multiple\
  \ dams of the great structure showed up. There we found a place so beautiful and\
  \ had our food which was all Pakistani traditional dishes and cuisine. \nLast but\
  \ not the least I had a great time of my life visiting this real yet almost giving\
  \ the image of some unreal world. The Story, the beauty and the experience all in\
  \ one just paid of beautifully as I just got a leap into the unknown and found the\
  \ most memorable and mesmerizing place to be... And how can I forget the breathtaking\
  \ view of the sunset at Katas\u2026 Trust my words one should give it a once in\
  \ a lifetime visit I bet you won't regret!"
