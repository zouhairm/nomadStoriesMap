Text: "I had cervelle d'agneau meuni\xE8re at the T\xEAte de Lard Bouchon one Friday\
  \ night with some of my classmates from language school. We wanted an authentic\
  \ Lyonnais experience and figured the bouchon was probably the best way to get it.\
  \ \n\nA bouchon is a traditional restaurant in Lyon, France. Chefs use animal organs\
  \ from cows, ducks, pigs, and sheep to make such dishes as andouillette (sausage\
  \ of intestines and/or blood), foie de veau (veal liver), t\xEAte de veau (veal\
  \ head), \xE9chine de cocher (pork spine), onglet de boeuf (beef tab of the stomach),\
  \ and cervelle d'agneau (sheep brains). \n\nMy classmates and I felt that this sounded\
  \ like pretty gruesome fare, but eating all parts of the animal instead of just\
  \ the muscle is a testament to the French aversion to wastefulness as well as their\
  \ celebration of tasty, rustic peasant food. These dishes are typically fatty given\
  \ the types of meats used, and they are nowhere near the lighter and fancier haute\
  \ cuisine we usually associate with French food. \n\nBouchons originated in the\
  \ 18th century with \"the Lyon mothers.\" As the website, Les Bouchons Lyonnais\
  \ states: \n\n\"[The mothers] were cooks from humble origins. They set up their\
  \ own businesses after working for bourgeois families in Lyon\u2026.The impact of\
  \ the war and the 1929 economic crisis were to change the face of Lyon\u2019s cuisine.\
  \ A lot of these cooks were dismissed from the homes where they worked. This is\
  \ when they opened their own restaurants\u2026much to our delight! Workers, celebrities\
  \ and rich businessmen sat side by side at their tables, in a friendly atmosphere!\"\
  \   \n\nAmong the most famous mothers were M\xE8re Fran\xE7oise Fillioux (1865-1925)\
  \ and M\xE8re Eug\xE9nie Brazier (1895-1977), dubbed the \"Mother of Modern French\
  \ Cooking.\" M\xE8re Brazier was the first woman to win three Michelin stars. Among\
  \ her famous proteg\xE9s was Paul Bocuse. M\xE8re Fillioux also earned three Michelin\
  \ stars. For more information about the mothers, check out Lyonresto.com.\n\nThe\
  \ bouchons today are anxious to guarantee both the quality of products and cuisine\
  \ as well as the authenticity of their tradition, which includes the welcome, ambience,\
  \ and respect for Lyon's history and heritage. In 1997, Pierre Grison created the\
  \ organization, L'Association de D\xE9fense des Bouchons Lyonnais (Association for\
  \ the Preservation of Lyonnais Bouchons), which certifies bouchons as \"authentic.\"\
  \ There are about 20 officially certified bouchons in Lyon and the Tete de Lard\
  \ is among them.\n\nAt first, it was a little difficult for my friends and me to\
  \ choose from the menu options because the dishes were so unfamiliar. In fact, we\
  \ used our cell phones to look up words that named the dishes. Once I found cervelle,\
  \ however, I knew I had to have it. My Dad ate brains when he was in France during\
  \ World War II. He said they looked like cauliflower but were tastier. My cervelle\
  \ was light with a crusty finish to its soft, non-mealy interior. The lemon, butter\
  \ and parsley meuni\xE8re sauce made it tangy. \n\nMeuni\xE8re refers to both sauce\
  \ and a method of preparation. Cooking something \xE0 la meuni\xE8re requires that\
  \ the meat is first dusted in seasoned flour and then saut\xE9d in brown butter,\
  \ chopped parsley, and lemon. Meuni\xE8re means \"miller's wife\" in French, which\
  \ refers to its rustic nature.\n\nSince my friends and I ordered almost everything\
  \ on the menu, we could try each other's dishes. We generally found the food tasty\
  \ and its appearance quite beautiful and not at all what we imagined. But as one\
  \ of our classmates who had eaten at a bouchon a couple weeks before said, \"In\
  \ order to try the food, you have to get over what it is.\" The chef at our bouchon\
  \ certainly knew how to make his dishes both appetizing and appealing!\n\nBy the\
  \ way, the menu at La T\xEAte de Lard was simple and affordable. Each plat (main\
  \ dish) included a complementary appetizer of crispy pork rinds and saucisson (pork\
  \ sausage). Hmmm, good!"
