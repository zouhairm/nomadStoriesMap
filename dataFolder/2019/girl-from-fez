Text: "I\u2019d always wanted to study Arabic. \nA language that both intimidated\
  \ and intrigued me.\nMy grandpa was an imam who spoke it fluently.\nHe was also\
  \ a polygamist married to six women, a fact that has come to intrigue me even more.\n\
  My family tells me the love he had for the language is one that was unparalleled\
  \ to anything he experienced with another human being during his lifetime.\nI recall\
  \ a story I heard, in which he walked my uncle to school as a child.\nA time in\
  \ which he and uncle would practice their pronunciation.\nHand in hand, one foot\
  \ in front of the other, they walked a mile along Monrovia.\nI\u2019d give anything\
  \ to command arabic the way they did.\nTo summon a type of confidence in my throat,\n\
  And to wield a type of dominance with my tongue.\nWhat a profound skill.\nI wish\
  \ we had had the chance to meet.\nA polygamist muslim and a feminist anthropologist.\n\
  That would have been interesting.\nAs a way to pay homage to his first and only\
  \ love,\nI decided to study Arabic abroad.\nA decision that caused my heart to race\
  \ in a sweet and tumultuous sort of way.\nI wonder what he would have thouht of\
  \ that.\nWhat his response would have been.\nWhile my journey has never been about\
  \ his decisions,\nI\u2019ve paraphrased his love for arabic into the manuscript\
  \ that is my story.\nSomething as simple as my name was completely shaken up during\
  \ this trip\nA key aspect of the human experience is filled with the intrinsic need\
  \ to derive meaning from the world around us. \nWe extract meaning from objects,\
  \ actions, words, and even names.\nI had always wondered what my name meant but\
  \ had never really gotten a clear answer.\nHaving come from a Liberian Muslim background,\
  \ I always knew my name had to mean something\nbut imagine my surprise in learning\
  \ that the literal translation of \u2018Facia\u2019 in arabic is \u2018Girl from\
  \ Fez.\u2019\nCoincidence or destiny?\n I felt rooted in the language every time\
  \ I would tell a Moroccan my name. \nLike me and Arabic had history.\nLike we knew\
  \ each other intimately.\nTheir faces would light up in delightful surprise as they\
  \ inquired \u201CFacia? From Fez?\u201D \nFez became a very special place for me,\
  \ not just because of my name but because of what I found in Fez. Fez helped me\
  \ mold my Black identity as an African refugee turned American Citizen. \nFez helped\
  \ craft my skill in a language that felt like a family heirloom.\nSo here I am,\
  \ at 12:03 pm in the A.L.I.F. Riad on the Saturday that marks the beginning of Ramadan.\
  \ \nHere I am feeling closer to someone I had never met, in a place I had never\
  \ been, speaking a language I had never learned.\nI had wished for, but never expected\
  \ that."
