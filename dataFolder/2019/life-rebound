Text: "[email\_protected]\n\tBeing a single mother, life is all about juggling between\
  \ your career and work. My\n              Life is all about being there for my child\
  \ Ruhaan. Life is a mundane as it gets. I had \n              quite a turbulent\
  \ past. So, life was much better with my son In tow rather\n                than\
  \ me being alone the captain of my own ship of life.\n              We were both\
  \ left alone in state of turmoil both mental and financial by my hubby \n      \
  \        Both financially and mentally. The circumstances were such that I had to\
  \ take life altering         \n            Decisions for myself and my son. I owe\
  \ all of it to my family were and are the rock solid pillars\n            Of my\
  \ life.\n          Now life is all about being there for him as a mother and father\
  \ both. It\u2019s quite \n          Overwhelming and gets on your nerves at times.\
  \ There are moments of full   Of craziness and                laughter spilled aground.\
  \ To Cut it short job was only for stability reasons. One fine day as I returned\
  \ back home after yet another drab day and reached home to find a mailbox of letters.\
  \ As I picked up all and thought most were not worth going Through I saw one envelope\
  \ stamp that of United Kingdom and I thought it\u2019s another   bank letter Asking\
  \ for account closure as I kept prolonging despite intimation from them. My gut\
  \ instinct told me to see it as won\u2019t harm. As I opened the letter and saw\
  \ it was from World of Nomads and   it dawned upon Me That it was what I casually\
  \ applied for but secretly hoped it would   happen. Now reality hit me so I spoke\
  \ about this to my parents regarding my son as I   would be away for two Weeks.\
  \ As expected they were quite supportive as they always have been especially my\
  \ sister.\n Finally, the day arrived when we were supposed to be departing to London;\
  \ Heathrow\nAirport. My mind and eyes were full of emotions with all thoughts. I\
  \ was leaving my soul; my kid behind for an unknown dream yet close to my heart.\
  \ Finally, the long journey was over and we reached Heathrow airport and it was\
  \ just before dawn. It was freezing cold but luckily we were dressed with good warm\
  \ \nclothing. \n       Our group was received at airport and taken to the Hilton\
  \ London Paddington and after rest for one day   we met Mr. Sean George; the Managing\
  \ Director of World of Nomads. \n       We all listen in awe to him and were quite\
  \ inspired. Slowly and steadily we all got acquainted \n       Not only to each\
  \ other but our training program for writing. We were staying quite close to countryside\n\
  \       for inspiration of great story ideas. I started unknowingly interacting\
  \ with him due to his vast experience and immense respect for all.\nDespite being\
  \ from different backgrounds we found similarities despite being from so different\
  \ cultural background. His father was Irish and mother was Indian and wholla!!!\
  \ From My city, Pune. \nI did my best to avoid the feelings for him as I did not\
  \ think I had those emotions Left in me as they were mercilessly robbed off me by\
  \ the person I trusted and love the most. But he knew his heart and mind was hell\
  \ bent on being with me for life. He was a thorough gentlemen and never crossed\
  \ any line whatsoever.\nFinally, our training program was over and I successfully\
  \ completed the same being a good performer. It was quite memorable journey   but\
  \ I felt of leaving something behind. Sean was present for our farewell and that\u2019\
  s when he proposed me for marriage. I was awestruck and worried as hell. My life\
  \ was no more my Decision now. He was quite persistent yet very gentle not pressurising\
  \ me at all. In fact, he travelled\nWith me till Pune to meet my son and my parents.\
  \ He assured me that we will marry Only if my son likes him and so do my parents.\
  \ As we landed in Pune after a long Journey he did not go his hotel but came and\
  \ met my parents. \nHe won over all and now we are together, settled and happy forever.\n\
