Text: "Five months ago,I decided to make a life change ,to live out my dream of living\
  \ in Dubai. It was a great step but a challenging one but the seed of determination\
  \ kept growing in me. Before i was born i had inside of me what just few people\
  \ where lucky to have .\n  Everyone has that secret wish which they keep hoping\
  \ to have one day. I also had a wish i was yearning for I prayed to God to make\
  \ it happen ,sometimes i felt it could happen sometimes i felt i was just imagining\
  \ .But every night before i closed my eyes I always believe i could do it\nIt is\
  \ not easy to make leaps ,I usually think going back and forth talking to myself\
  \ like i was insane ....sometimes i i felt how can i leave my job,my family,my friends\
  \ and go to Dubai where i knew no one. I pondered about it day and night ,wondering\
  \ how life was gonna be ,But you know what? I was determined it.\n     It took me\
  \ two month to really put my self together ,I left my job and my family and then\
  \ one day i decided to\" take the bull by the horn\"\n    \n  I booked my ticket\
  \ to Dubai in August 1986,I was in the plane watching the plane taking off ,I cried,\
  \ tears of joy and fulfillment .It was a dream come true. Then i realised that having\
  \ a passion can take you anywhere, It doesn't matter where you come from , All that\
  \ matters is your passion.\n\n   Be with people who challenge you to make the big\
  \ leaps. Don't settle for less, Because you can be anything in life , It terrifying\
  \ to \" leap into the unknown\"\nTo be out of your comfort zone and family but i\
  \ also know that where amazing things happen\n\nA leap into the unknown changed\
  \ my life for good."
