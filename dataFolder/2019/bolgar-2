Text: "Bolgar, a name of a town I never heard before. Before I went there I though\
  \ the camp will be held somewhere around Kazan, and that I may go there in the evenings\
  \ and freetime, and that I may visit my friend in Mari El at the weekends as her\
  \ place was not that far from Kazan. So when I arrived in Kazan, my friend from\
  \ Kransogorski, Mari El picked me up and we went there (3 hours by bus), a town\
  \ in the middle of a wood, even in the town was mood, just everywhere. It was really\
  \ lovely and full of mosquitoes, as there did not just been the wood but also a\
  \ big lake, which is the paradise for mosquitoes. I think it is not really a town,\
  \ but also not a village, it is called \u201Curban-typed settlement\u201D, \u043F\
  \u043E\u0441\u0451\u043B\u043E\u043A \u0433\u043E\u0440\u043E\u0434\u0441\u043A\u043E\
  \u0433\u043E \u0442\u0438\u043F\u0430 in Russian. \nSo Katya picked me up, we went\
  \ to Kransogorsky and got biten by hungry mosquitoes, she showed me the lake and\
  \ the next day we went back to Kazan as I wanted to see the city and also becaue\
  \ I wanted to get in contact with the others of the team. I was told to go to Bolgar\
  \ the next day and my first though was \u201CWTF\u201D, as I never heard of that\
  \ place. I went into a bookstore and asked about Bolgar and I got to know that it\
  \ is a very historic place, that was even capital of the Tatarian Empire from 8th\
  \ to 15th century and center of the Volgabulgars. So I was excited what to see there.\
  \ \nThere was a bus or a ferry and as I though that three hours in a  ferry is much\
  \ cooler than three hours in a bus I took the ferry and went along river Volga.\
  \ At some areas the river was so wide that the shore was not visible.\n\nWhen I\
  \ arrived in Bolgar I went to the childrens camp, which was next to the river, not\
  \ far from the historical center. The camp was located at the area of the towns\
  \ onliest hotel, and our accommodation was also inside the hotel. There were many\
  \ kids, and I had two classes per day. As I never teached German before it was quite\
  \ interesting, most time we played kids games, but also made some Grammar stuff\
  \ and read textes of Rammstein. In the afternoons I had freetime, time enough to\
  \ discover the place. The historical center of Bolgar consists of a very huge area,\
  \ with some mosques, a church and a museum. One mosque is made out of white stones\
  \ and looks like Taj Mahal.\nMy friend (the other German teacher) and me often went\
  \ inside the historical area and looked around, once we went inside the white mosque\
  \ and the Iman showed us around, and as my friend had blonde, long hair, he seemed\
  \ to be very happy to show his mosque to us. I am sure we were his first German\
  \ visitors for years. We also went into the orthodox church, and a very young, very\
  \ shy novice asked us very politely if we could cover our knees, since only hookers\
  \ would show their knees open. Sure, we did, we also covered our hair with smelly\
  \ headscarfes. Then the young novice showed us an icon of the Mother of God, to\
  \ whom we had to bow three times. We did that and had to refrain from laughing.\
  \ Afterwards, the novice warned us that we should always be careful that our knees\
  \ were covered, otherwise no good husbands would be found. For future husbands would\
  \ pay attention to the fact that women are celibate. \nThen we went out the church\
  \ and did not stop laughing for the next 20 minutes. I think that was very uncelibate.\
  \ The guy in the mosque was cooler, maybe it was because he was older than the novice,\
  \ but he did not compare us to hookers and was worried about any future husbands.\n\
  Once we took the break to attent a local market, and we got into a conversation\
  \ with two fruit sellers. They were Azeris, and sold azerian water melons. One was\
  \ very fat and the other was his helper. The watermelons they sold were very tasty,\
  \ very juiceful and while we were eating the fat man pinched our breats. Somehow\
  \ we did not like that, but at least we got free melons for the next days. So we\
  \ went back to the camp and silently took the melons in our room, hoped, that non\
  \ of the kids would see what we got. We shared the melons with the other teachers,\
  \ and we ate from them the next four days. The last day, the rest of the melons\
  \ were already alcoholic,we all got a bit tipsy and made the best lessons ever."
