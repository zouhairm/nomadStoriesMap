Text: "Every heart will be delighted about descovering new places and new things.\
  \ \nThe world is full of amazing places that everyone would like to set their eyes\
  \ on them. \nI appreciate the great work of the creator (God) and I would like to\
  \ feel it in full. The day that I will get the opportunity to set my eyes on God's\
  \ amazing art, I will grab it and will never let it go. When I think of tall mountains\
  \ like Himalaya, I feel like i can make my own wings in order to fly in the air\
  \ and alight wherever my heart wishes. When I think of different races of people\
  \ that God created, I feel like i can travel by feet to Asia in order to see this\
  \ mervelous art of the creator. My eyes want to see these different people with\
  \ different colours from all the corners of the planet. My ears wants to hear differently\
  \ languages spoken by every ethnic group in all the five continents. \nI enjoy spending\
  \ time with new people, and share stories about what are happening in in the world.\
  \ I enjoy learning new languages just to widen my social life. Traveling has been\
  \ a dream for every human being, but not everyone can travel because it is beyond\
  \ the ability of some people. This is because most of people are financially incapable\
  \ of traveling. As a young African, I think traveling can develop my continent.\
  \ Because, when you're going out of your own country you learn a lot of strategies\
  \ that can make your country go forward in terms of development.  Just imagine,\
  \ if one person can have a significant share of his country's development, then\
  \ how can this be if hundred people were sharing something to this particular development?\
  \ \nI still believe that traveling is the remedy of most of corrupted minds. Sometimes\
  \ we need to spend precious time with people of different countries so we get precious\
  \ advices on how we can do or not do in our lives. Being away of your everyday environment\
  \ can provide positive advantages to yourself or even to the coming generations."
