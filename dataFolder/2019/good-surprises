Text: "Since I was a little girl, I always loved an adventure, exploring new places\
  \ and understanding new cultures. To me it is fascinating how many countries and\
  \ cultures are so different. I am Brazilian and my country was colonised by Portugal.\
  \ Here, we can speak the same language and have the same food, but still we are\
  \ two very different countries! What I\u2019m trying to say is that every country\
  \ is unique and every country has its own beauty. My childhood dream was to always\
  \ become a flight attendant just so that I could go to all these different countries.\
  \ When I was 11 years old I decided to become a volunteer in a Christian organisation.\
  \ Being a volunteer open the door to me to helping other people whilst learning\
  \ more about other cultures and countries myself. I went to 4 countries with this\
  \ Christian organisation. These are England, Uganda, Argentina and Scotland. Whilst\
  \ being in each country I learned something different about myself and how to respect\
  \ other cultures. I will share some of my experiences from England.\nWhen I was\
  \ 18 years old I moved to England to become a volunteer in an organisation called\
  \ YWAM which means Youth With A Mission. I didn\u2019t know how to speak English\
  \ and I have never been so far away from home or my family for such a long time.\
  \ To be honest I was so used to having my family around me. At the start of my time\
  \ in England I found it very challenging. And sometimes I thought of giving up and\
  \ coming back to Brazil. Now I understand that this time was needed for me to grow\
  \ and cut the ambilical cord with my family. I struggled from culture shock at the\
  \ beginning of my time in England, however with time I got used to the British culture.\n\
  \ I completed an English school for three months with an amazing group of people\
  \ supporting me. \nI am fortunate enough to have the gift of making friends very\
  \ easily and as a result, while I was helping serve food to a group of old people,\
  \  I met a lady named Jenny. To my surprise, Jenny and her husband adopted me as\
  \ a part of their family. They taught me about British culture, British history\
  \ and were great blessing to me.\n When the school finished, I decided to help with\
  \ refugees in the north of England in a city called Derby. This was one of my favourite\
  \ times in England. I was teaching English to the refugees where I never expected\
  \ that one day I\u2019ll be doing such thing. Most of the refugees were from Syria,\
  \ Iraq and some from Africa. My biggest lesson while being with such refugees was\
  \ how to be grateful and happy. It is intriguing how we have a lot of things such\
  \ as a great home and food at our fingertips, while we moan about so much. Here\
  \ I saw the refugees with little to nothing, yet they were so happy!\nSoon enough\
  \ I became very close with a refugee named Oma. Oma is from Syria. Oma and her husband\
  \ have lived in England for one year, she struggles with speaking English but he\
  \ is very good! Oma and her husband left Syria due to the war. She became very close\
  \ to me. Sometimes we couldn\u2019t understand each other because of the language\
  \ barrier however we got along very well. To me, Oma is a warrior trying to learn\
  \ English and adjust to the British culture.\n When I left Derby it was a blessing\
  \ to me to see her progress in the English language. She has impacted my life a\
  \ lot for the better. This is why I was so focused on learning English; so that\
  \ I could teach the refugees. I have so many memories and great stories that I want\
  \ to cheer on lots of other people. Writing is a good way of me cheering on others\
  \ and speaking of different cultures different people and different food, great\
  \ food of course!\nThank you."
