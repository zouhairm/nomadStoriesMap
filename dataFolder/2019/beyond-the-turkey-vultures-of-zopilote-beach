Text: "Moises is like a lot of flight attendants. Or doctors or cab drivers. He could\u2019\
  ve been a comedian. Instead he is a river guide-cum-historian and naturalist.\n\n\
  He kills the engine and we idle toward a pair of crocodiles lounging along the Mezcalapa\
  \ River. The female eases into the still water, also called the Rio Grijalva. He\
  \ teases us that they won\u2019t eat people - we\u2019re too contaminated with plastics.\
  \ He\u2019s as knowledgeable as he is funny. \n\nThis canyon is as old as the Grand\
  \ Canyon, both formed from cracks in the Earth's crust 35 million years ago. We\u2019\
  re hurtling through the Ca\xF1\xF3n del Sumidero in a hard plastic boat called a\
  \ lancha and I wish I had snowboarding goggles\u200A\u2014\u200Athe wind pelts us\
  \ as hard as the sun while Moises shouts the cities and important sites we'll pass\u200A\
  \u2014\u200AComit\xE1n, Palenque, Villahermosa, Tuxtla Guti\xE9rrez.\n\nBut it\u2019\
  s not long before I forget about my wind-chapped eyes. Because all I can see are\
  \ Oregon birds. Everywhere. Angel-white egrets and ink-black cormorants on both\
  \ shores. I am completely awestruck, thousands of miles from where I grew up, careening\
  \ through a canyon Moises tells us is up to 1,000 meters high. And deep in Chiapas,\
  \ just like in the Willamette Valley, there are the cormorants - perched on felled\
  \ trees and river rocks, their wings spread wide, drying their feathers in the February\
  \ sunshine.\n\nI try to drink in the sight of as many of them as I can, thinking\
  \ the first few I see will be the last. Like the other endangered and threatened\
  \ species calling this canyon home. Yet they preen and fish and fly all along the\
  \ river, unexpected shocks of black and white punctuating countless shades of green.\
  \ I am overjoyed to see them.\n\nOnly at Playa de Zopilote, the turkey vulture beach,\
  \ are there no egrets or cormorants. The portly birds dominate this beach. Unlike\
  \ the red-beaked vultures back home, their grey beaks and feet look weathered, sun-bleached,\
  \ against their glossy black plumage. Rotund and awkward, I\u2019ve never seen so\
  \ many vultures waddling and congregating in one place before. Moises reassures\
  \ us they won\u2019t eat us either.\n\nSoon after the beach we bank to the left,\
  \ an inlet that feels more like a mangrove than the rest of the river. One spider\
  \ monkey hangs low from a tree above us, his tail longer than his arms. We don\u2019\
  t notice the other one at first. It's perched higher and farther back from where\
  \ we\u2019ve \u201Cparked\u201D, sitting with its arms folded, suspicious or displeased\
  \ or both. Moises doesn\u2019t tell us if they\u2019re a mated pair like the crocodiles.\
  \ They seem more like curious kid and cranky uncle.\n\nThere are oak and pine trees\
  \ everywhere, though to my untrained eye everything looks more like jungle than\
  \ forest. Moises doesn't explain the difference between selva and bosque. And when\
  \ we float past the Seahorse stalactite I'm the only one who can't distinguish it\
  \ hanging from the rest of the rocks like a 3D print.\n\nOne impossibly tall limestone\
  \ escarpment is home to Christmas Tree Falls - its \"branches\" are skirts of moss\
  \ descending down the cliffside in a layered triangle. No water falls from it today\
  \ but this Oregon girl can only imagine what a Christmas tree-shaped waterfall looks\
  \ like during the rainy summers. \n\nThe next time Moises slows we drift to the\
  \ right and into The Cave of Colors, mineral-rich pink and green walls of potassium\
  \ and magnesium deposits where another lancha full of tourists sits below a shrine\
  \ to the Virgin of Guadalupe\u200A\u2014\u200Athe last thing I expected to see high\
  \ inside a cave on a river. A placard below the shrine commemorates the environmental\
  \ advocacy of a Dr. Miguel Alvarez del Toro, the last of the living explorers, a\
  \ tireless warrior for nature, creator of the Sumidero Canyon National Park.\n\n\
  I assume I'm not the only Catholic in this plastic boat, sunburned in an ill-fitting\
  \ lifejacket, but I don't cross myself. I say a little prayer of gratitude to myself\
  \ for this current-less green river, for the trees and the monkeys. The crocodiles\
  \ and the fish. For their protection. And for these birds that, like me, might also\
  \ call both Oregon and Mexico home."
