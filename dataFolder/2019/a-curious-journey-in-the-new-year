Text: "\u201CI have no idea from where came such courage. Certainly, it was not from\
  \ me\u201D, said my dad who never traveled by plane and never has been abroad. My\
  \ sister and I decided to cross the border of Brazil to celebrate New Year in Buenos\
  \ Aires, Argentina. Well, we are not experienced travelers (even I\u2019m an aspiring\
  \ travel writer). We can\u2019t understand maps. GPS also is useless for us. Tourist\
  \ guides would be the right solution, but we wanted to feel more independent. We\
  \ wanted to start 2019 trying to do something more challenging, just following our\
  \ unstoppable instinct of curiosity and our talent to talk with unknown people.\
  \ \n\nSo, the easiest way to not get lost would be trust in our Spanish skills.\
  \ People\u2019s hands pointing the directions worked much better for us. Actually,\
  \ if you are a Brazilian in Buenos Aires you don\u2019t need to worry about Spanish\
  \ language. Brazilian tourists are everywhere and, sometimes, all you have to do\
  \ is just join them. There is a good chance they are going to the same place you\
  \ are looking for, especially if you are trying to go to Puerto Madero, the traditional\
  \ neighborhood where New Year festivities are celebrated. \n\nIt was about 10:00\
  \ pm on December, 31, when we met a very nice Brazilian family who had just arrived\
  \ in the same hotel we were hosted. Puerto Madero was 20 minutes walk from our starting\
  \ point.  So, we had time before midnight to discover the route together and to\
  \ get to know each other better. For sure it took me much more than 20 minutes until\
  \ I was able to memorize the names of everybody and their relation between them.\
  \ The worst is the fact I believe I have a certain level of prosopagnosia, which\
  \ means I can\u2019t recognize faces easily. That is why I tried to memorize their\
  \ clothes, just in case I got lost in the middle of the crowd. \n\nWhen we sighted\
  \ the famous Puente de la Mujer, lit in purple, in the middle of the R\xEDo de la\
  \ Plata (River Plate), we knew we were in Puerto Madero already. It is a curious\
  \ bridge designed by the Spanish architect Santiago Calatrava. They say it represents\
  \ a couple dancing tango, but, personally, I could not to identify anything similar\
  \ with that. Anyway, I just can tell you this bridge is exactly as shown by Google\
  \ images. What we did next was choose a location to wait for midnight to watch the\
  \ fireworks. Well, unlike the most part of celebrations in Brazil, there are no\
  \ shows of famous bands or big parties during New Year in Puerto Madero. Believe\
  \ or not, my sister and I feel very relieved because of that.\n\n\nOnce fireworks\
  \ announced it was midnight, people started to hug each other very excited while\
  \ my head was spinning like a carousel looking at the sky. I was trying to follow\
  \ those colorful sparkles coming from all directions. For sure I would feel more\
  \ comfortable if I was wearing a neck pillow. I didn\u2019t know it would last so\
  \ long! Anyway, after some time enjoying that special display, everybody was very\
  \ hungry! Then, we started our search for food but every restaurant we tried to\
  \ enter was full because people had previously booked. So we thought about fast-food,\
  \ but it was closed! There was not even a popcorn vendor in the streets! \n\nWe\
  \ finally found a restaurant where they also serve pizza. We needed to wait a little\
  \ until they had enough places for everybody. When we were all seated, the waitress\
  \ put the cutlery on the table, left us the menu and said: \u201Cwe don't have pizza\
  \ anymore. You can choose other meals\u201D. Well, every dish was absurdly expensive!\
  \ So, we choose leave without eating. Our new friends got some cold sandwiches in\
  \ a pub. According to them only the bread was eatable. I remembered that I had a\
  \ cereal bar in my purse. I bought a bottle of water and that was my New Year's\
  \ dinner in Buenos Aires. My sister decided to wait for the hotel\u2019s breakfast.\
  \ Okay, if everything was perfect, we would not have had such an unexpected story!"
