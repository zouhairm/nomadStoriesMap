Text: "I pulled Meilin behind me as we ran through the streets of London. My hand\
  \ tightly held her wrist, urging her to meet my longer strides. We\u2019re not going\
  \ to make it. The buildings were blurring together as we ran. On every corner sat\
  \ an old brick building, different in design but familiar enough to raise concern.\
  \ Did we pass the turn? This left or the next?  \n\n\u201CRight.\u201D Meilin\u2019\
  s winded voice cut through the sound of my hastened breath.  \n\n\u201CYou sure\u201D\
  \ I questioned, turning my head just enough to see Meilin offer a semi confident\
  \ nod. With that we took the corner, knowing we didn\u2019t have enough time to\
  \ confirm. This had to be right. My body felt numb as my legs frantically pushed\
  \ me forward. Stress flooded my body, blocking out any exhaustion. We just needed\
  \ to make it there. My eyes locked on all that was ahead of me, willing it into\
  \ existence. We must be close.  \n\n\u201CIt\u2019s there! It\u2019s on the right.\u201D\
  \ Meilin shouted as she pushed forward to match my pace. She was to the left of\
  \ me now. Focusing forward again, it was there.  \n\n \n\n                     \
  \                                                                              \
  \           ~\n\n \n\n\u201CSo, I guess I\u2019m going to London\u201D I stated,\
  \ sitting down in my French class.  \n\nMaddie and Natalina turned to look at me.\
  \  \n\n\u201CWhen did this happen\u201D Maddie inquired.  \n\n\u201CI messaged one\
  \ of my dad\u2019s friends from his baseball days in Australia. Her name is Sue\
  \ and she lives in England now. I have never met her, but my dad connected us, and\
  \ I messaged her a week ago.\u201D \n\nI paused to gauge their reactions. Maddie\u2019\
  s face was scrunched up and Natalina looked blank.  \n\n\u201CShe invited me to\
  \ stay with her for a couple weeks. I convinced my mom last night... I just need\
  \ to find someone to go with.\u201D I rushed out a quick explanation and silently\
  \ hoped one of them would express interest in going.  \n\n\u201CDoesn't that seem\
  \ a bit sketchy?\u201D Concern coated Maddie's features and I could see her trying\
  \ to work out more questions. The world was sketchy to Maddie, the girl was afraid\
  \ of going downtown past four in the afternoon. Natalina's mouth was slightly parted,\
  \ perplexed, as though she wanted to say something but couldn\u2019t find words.\
  \  \n\n\u201CCan I go?\u201D It was the question I needed someone to ask. I looked\
  \ away from my friends to see that it had come from Meilin. She had set her pen\
  \ down on her notebook and gave me an eager smile. We had only exchanged a total\
  \ of two sentences in freshman Biology so now it was my turn to be perplexed.  \n\
  \n\u201CIf you need someone, I am most definitely up for it\u201D she insisted.\
  \ \u201CUnless you had someone else in mind\u201D. I did need someone. I looked\
  \ to my friends and was hit with the sudden realization that they were both too\
  \ afraid to ever agree.  \n\n\u201CFantastic. Let\u2019s go to England.\u201D \n\
  \n \n\n                                                                        \
  \                                      ~\n\n \n\nI threw my arms around Meilin\u2019\
  s tiny frame, standing on the last train of the night out of London to Broxbourne.\
  \ Oyster cards still in hand from the sprint, we jumped up and down in victory.\
  \ Less than thirty seconds after boarding the first open car the doors close, the\
  \ train takes off, and we are still standing there elated.  \n\n\u201CAll of that\
  \ for a concert\u201D Meilin laughs.  \n\n\u201CCorrection. All of that for the\
  \ absolute best concert.\u201D The church that had been converted into the concert\
  \ venue was perhaps the most magical place I had ever been. The way the purple and\
  \ blue lights from the stage illuminated the stained glass felt like something from\
  \ a dream.  \n\nMeilin was still laughing as she picked out a row on the empty train\
  \ car. Sitting down her face lit up with realization and she pulled out her phone.\
  \ \u201CI almost forgot. I\u2019ll text Sue and tell her we are on our way back.\
  \ Forty minutes.\u201D  \n\n\u201CAwesome. She recorded Love Island to watch tonight.\
  \ Her daughters are waiting up to watch it with us and they made cookies.\u201D\
  \ I smiled at the thought of the mom and her two daughters waiting to hear about\
  \ our night."
