Text: "I moved to the Outback five weeks ago with my wife. She moved for a job. I\
  \ moved for change, chasing the Dreamtime landscape. \n\nQueensland, where I moved\
  \ from, is a landscape of gemstone colours. There are azure skies and lapis lazuli\
  \ seas, peridot and kiwi topaz grass beneath fluorite and green tourmaline trees.\
  \ The east coast of Queensland is rich in vibrant colours, and I imagine from a\
  \ certain height, if you were to fly above the land, the shoreline would look like\
  \ a jeweled bangle adorning Australia. Even the Queensland sun is beautiful and\
  \ casts a warm and comforting glow. This is Queensland: restful, gentle, and bright.\
  \ The postcard of Australian summers; the sunshine state.\n\nIf the Territory were\
  \ a stone, it would not be of the vibrant gem colours evident in Queensland, save\
  \ for, perhaps, rubies, when the sun is positioned right and there is fire on the\
  \ horizon. No. The Territory is not made of gemstones; the Territory is clay. There\
  \ is the loose powdered clay of the dirt and the Red Centre desert sand, sometimes\
  \ white and sometimes a deep, burnt orange. Then there is the hard-packed clay of\
  \ the red jutting rocks and MacDonnell ranges that border Alice Springs.\n\nI see\
  \ the ranges from everywhere in town, the ancient carcasses of the Dreamtime caterpillars\u2014\
  Yeperenye, Ntyarlke, and Utnerrengatye\u2014laying dead in the dust. This is the\
  \ story of the ranges: a violent battle took place between ancient insects, caterpillars\
  \ and stink bugs, and when the stink bugs tore the heads off the caterpillars, they\
  \ fell to the ground and the ranges were made. \n\nI know these ranges will not\
  \ mean to me what they mean to the Arrernte people. The caterpillars are not my\
  \ story, not my heritage, as they are to the Arrernte. I understand this, and I\
  \ respect this. The caterpillars are part of what connects the Arrernte to this\
  \ land. As an outsider, a non-Indigenous Australian, I must find my own connection.\
  \ And I want this desperately. This land is beautiful: the dry and striking landscape\
  \ has a power I am all too aware of yet do not understand. And I am scared. I am\
  \ scared I will never belong and scared this land of rich colour and burnt life\
  \ will never accept me, its delicate sands slipping through my outstretched hand.\
  \ \n\nFor my first five weeks in Mparntwe (Alice Springs), I stayed within the ancient\
  \ caterpillar carcasses, always aware of their presence and reminded of their fall\
  \ to the stink bugs. But last Friday, our Nissan Micra arrived from Brisbane, a\
  \ city car come to the desert, its lime-green paint a stark contrast to the standard\
  \ white Toyota Hilux. But a car means mobility, and our Micra meant escape from\
  \ the watchful presence of the caterpillars. \n\nOn Sunday night we took our small\
  \ green Micra to see the stars. Leaving the Mparntwe lights behind, we drove through\
  \ the beheaded caterpillars and into the desert\u2014no direction and only a want\
  \ to find the milky way and starry sky. \n\nAt first, the road was bitumen: dark\
  \ blue rivers veining through the red and black landscape. I kept my eyes trained\
  \ out the window: red sands and black skies. I looked for stars, but the orange\
  \ streetlights kept the delicate white dots from reaching town\u2014an effect that\
  \ could not last. Soon the streetlights were gone, and only the blue-river roads\
  \ continued until they too were left behind, and our city car was skimming across\
  \ corrugated red sand. My bones rattled. And I wanted to keep going. I wanted to\
  \ keep going until my bones rattled free of my skin, and my carcass too was left\
  \ in the sand. \n\nAnd then we stopped, on the side of the red road in the red desert\
  \ with nothing but black shadows, black skies, and a thousand speckled stars above\
  \ our heads. I was breathless. I had never seen so many stars\u2014a girl from the\
  \ city. I left my Birkenstocks in the car, opened the door, and my feet sunk into\
  \ the soft red sand. And I felt, at that moment, that the desert and I were one."
