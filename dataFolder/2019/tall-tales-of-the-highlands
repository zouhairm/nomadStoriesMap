Text: "It rained the whole drive up the western coastline from Glasgow so the soil\
  \ had soaked into a soupy brine by the time I arrived in Glenelg. On the drive,\
  \ my guide and host Eddie, a Scots playwright, highlands tour guide, and windmill\
  \ engineer, would pull over and tell stories of what had happened there: the clearances,\
  \ a battle between warring clans, or the filming of the movie Skyfall -- while I\
  \ was bitten by midges. To me the land seemed static, to Eddie, each creek and hill\
  \ had a different heart; a story that made it unique. When we reached the highlands\
  \ I stepped out of the car and sank ankle-deep into the mud, which grabbed my shoe\
  \ and wouldn't let go. \n\nThe next morning, the sun broke through the clouds and\
  \ flooded the landscape. From the window next to my bed, the peat-carpeted hills\
  \ rolled through the countryside while herds of sheep grazed beneath. A couple cows\
  \ strayed through the fence onto the lawn of the bungalow where I stayed a few minutes\
  \ away from Eddie's house. I got dressed and made a cup of instant coffee. It tasted\
  \ the way my mud caked shoes smelled: earthy, tangy, and bitter.\n\nI walked to\
  \ Eddie's house along the only road in the village and spooked a group of sheep\
  \ headed the other direction. One young sheep -- not yet marked with paint like\
  \ the older ones -- was frightened. It turned and ran, crashing into the stone barrier\
  \ between the street and hillside. It lay on the ground still for a moment but when\
  \ I moved to help, it rose and ran in the other direction to rejoin its flock. \n\
  \nI reached Eddie's house and rang the doorbell while attempting to scrape the dirt\
  \ from the soles of my shoes with a stick. They were the first thing Eddie noticed\
  \ when he opened the door. \n\"Don\u2019t you have any Welly's?\" He asked.\n\"\
  Any what?\" I said.\n\"Here.\" He handed me a pair of Wellington rain boots two\
  \ sizes too big for me. \"You'll need these for the Quiraing. Stuff some socks in\
  \ the toes to make them fit.\"\n\nWe drove to the port where the Kylerhea ferry\
  \ had run to the Isle of Skye for decades. More of a barge than a ferry, it was\
  \ small and did little to disturb the feeling of antiquity around us. The land looked\
  \ ancient, and it was easy to visualize Eddie\u2019s stories, even the myths seemed\
  \ possible. The small islands grew like muscles out of the sea and for a moment\
  \ looked like the humps of a giant serpent. \n\nAs we disembarked the ferry and\
  \ began our hour drive through the hills and seaside towns of the Isle of Skye,\
  \ Eddie told me we were hiking to the fairy table. A flat hilltop high in the Trotternish\
  \ mountains where the fairies danced.\n\n\"The fairies like attractive young men,\"\
  \ he said, \"stay with me and you'll be fine. If you go off on your own they'll\
  \ take you back to their cave and give you a pleasant death, having sex with you\
  \ until you waste away.\u201D \n\nWe continued on across the landscape as he told\
  \ me more stories of the giants, fairies, and people that inhabited this land. He\
  \ spoke in facts and details, skipping over the impossibilities the way our tires\
  \ skirted over the puddles formed by last night's rain.\n\nWe reached the Quiraing\
  \ and the hills changed shape becoming sharper, more violent. The grassy round knolls\
  \ were replaced by sheer cliff faces and brooks were replaced by mountain streams\
  \ racing to the sea. We hiked for an hour, up muddy hillsides and jumping over creeks\
  \ that dripped from the cliffs as small waterfalls until we reached the highest\
  \ point, the only place I had seen in the highlands absent of sheep. It was windy,\
  \ damp, and alive. The water pushed onto the land like an army and stole silt back\
  \ into the sea. As we searched for fairies in the crags and nooks of the rocks around\
  \ us, Eddie recited a poem by Robert Burns and I saw what connected us to that land:\
  \ the stories we tell, and those that came before us."
