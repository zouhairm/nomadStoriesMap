Text: "A product of Instagram generation I would be sitting at work, scrolling down\
  \ on the many \"wanderlust\" friendly pages that I had liked. Always wanting to\
  \ make the leap but sometimes I did not find people to go with, most times I would\
  \ have professional commitments. And year after year I found myself making the same\
  \ excuses and longing at the same pages. So when December 2016 rolled by I decided\
  \ to make the leap and book tickets to the destination I had heard of from many\
  \ people, that was easily accessible and most importantly was a beach destination.\
  \ \n\nI booked my tickets and with that I went into panic mode. I was less excited\
  \ about the people I would meet but more nervous about how many of those people\
  \ would try and mug me. But I had booked my tickets, there was no going back. I\
  \ imagined myself losing it in front of random strangers who I would be sharing\
  \ the hostel dorm with and cursed myself for having booked a mixed gender room.\
  \ On the day of departure, I missed my flight. I thought it was a sign, clearly,\
  \ I was not ready to do this. I sat at the airport after having cried for being\
  \ irresponsible but also half relieved that hey, I have a legitimate excuse to not\
  \ push myself \"out there\", wherever that is. But then the thought of going back\
  \ to my regular work day came to my head. This time I decided to go for the unknown\
  \ evil as compared to the known one. \n\nI rebooked my tickets (thank you contingency\
  \ financial planning!) and off I went. After two flights, one bus ride and one ferry\
  \ ride, I was finally in Koh Samui. Although there was a direct flight but thanks\
  \ to having missed it I had to take this complicated route. But my oh my am I glad\
  \ that I did it. Because the first 24 hours of my adventure, traveling, tired, food\
  \ deprived, sleep deprived and already low on cash, I did not get mugged, my stuff\
  \ did not get stolen; instead I found random strangers answering the most basic\
  \ questions to me with a smile. I had just reached my hostel in Koh Samui and I\
  \ already felt accomplished. As I had been forced to rough it out in the journey,\
  \ hot shower, hot food and well, hot people around me, lifted my mood and my spirits.\
  \ I began the next week with exploring the island, trying different activities,\
  \ meeting with people outside and inside my hostel. Just doing all of what I had\
  \ written myself off for. \n\nNext came the weekend for the 'Full Moon Party'. I\
  \ had heard about the party and seen it in videos but the only research I had done\
  \ in relation to it was how many way I could get robbed, raped or well, dropped\
  \ off in the water. This party is held every month on the day of full moon on the\
  \ island of Koh Phangan. Yes! The entire island is one big party that begins around\
  \ 7-8 pm of the first day and goes on till the afternoon of the next day. THROUGH\
  \ THE NIGHT. I thought to myself, can I do it? Could I travel to another island\
  \ at night with nothing but some cash and my phone with terrible internet and over\
  \ all connectivity to party with some 10,000 odd people from around the world? Oh\
  \ wait, these many people would be drunk and to have a good time, so would I. How\
  \ do I be cautious and still have fun? I have no explanation to what happened next,\
  \ how I mustered up the courage to do this, a thing that I would on any other day\
  \ dismiss as a no-deal situation. I went for it, I was euphoric, I drank and I danced\
  \ and I got radium tattoos and I was happy. \n\nI found what I did not know I had\
  \ lost, I found the non-anxiety ridden version of myself. I found me, and it set\
  \ me free!"
