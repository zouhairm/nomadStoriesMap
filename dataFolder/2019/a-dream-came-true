Text: 'Somenone told me  once that if I traveled to this place I will met a tiny paradise
  in which I could touch the sky

  And I was there, traveling by ferry to a place called Playa El Cielo in Cozumel.
  The trip felt like an eternity because you can only see the sea and waves, but when
  you get there is when you think that everything was worth it because you never imagined
  that there could be such a blue sea in which if you put your back on the sea and
  open your eyes to the sky you will immediately feel that you are floating in the
  sky or even walk in it because in that part the sea is so lower and calm.

  Playa del Cielo is one of those places that once you arrived you will never want
  to go back, I don''t know if it is for the peace you feel when you put a foot there,
  their nice and friendly people who always offers you a smile in every step you take
  or the combination of delicious two-state food (Cozumel and Merida). I''ve felt
  so part of a place that I now think of being part of its population and it''s because
  you can fall in love easily of this place no matter where do you come from in other
  words you feel a deep connection.'
