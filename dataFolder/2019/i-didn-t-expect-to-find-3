Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find\nIt was Wednesday 17-1-2019. I had vacation from\
  \ university. It was normal day as per routine I woke up at 11:30am. We had applied\
  \ for Umrah since last 2 months but there were some issues in booking tickets\u2019\
  \ and visa. We lost hope for going for Umrah. At 1:30 pm phone bell ringed. I attend\
  \ the call the caller was male. Feels like he was in very hurry. First tried to\
  \ know who the person on other side was.Oh, he was my uncle and said congratulation\
  \ your umrah ticket has been booked. Our Flight will be on Thursday 18-jan-2019\
  \ at 2:40am. I was surprised and shocked as well. We don\u2019t know what to do.\
  \ Feelings were mixed. We were not prepared for it, everything was very messy bags\
  \ were not packed and off course we had very short time. Packing started, completing\
  \ everything that we took with us. Guests were arriving to meet us before we go,\
  \ and everyone requested for prayers that were very blessed feelings. At 1:00am\
  \ we sit in our car for airport, and we arrived there at 1:35 am. Our check in well\
  \ be open at 1:40am, after 5 mints of arriving.When everything cleared, we sit in\
  \ lounge and preparing ourselves for the umrah, taking Ahram. At 2:25 we were in\
  \ flight and we were continuously repeating \u2018\u2019Talhbiah\u2019\u2019\u2026\
  ... At 11:00 am we arrived at Makkah hotel. Then we had rest for some time and went\
  \ to Haram to perform Umrah. When we entered from Haram gate, our feelings were\
  \ un expressible. The Holy Kabbah was in front of me and I was in front of Holy\
  \ Kabbah wow! what a beautiful place I never seen before that day on the whole earth\
  \ in my whole life.Oh, my Allah I forgot everything every prayer about which I thought\
  \ before coming here. My mind was blank, and I started crying with nonstop tears\
  \ I felt that the time stops here, and I am cried continuously and remembered my\
  \ all sins that I have done before. I prayed to my Allah please forgive me and give\
  \ me a chance to do good deeds pleases accept my all prayers amen sum amen. I wished\
  \ that time stops there while I was standing in front of Kabbah for my whole life.\
  \ I never ever seen or felt that kind of peaceful place before that. After all my\
  \ prayers we started performing Umrah. We completed it at 7:30pm. After Isha prayers\
  \ we all went to Hotel for to have some rest. We spend 3 days in Makkah we went\
  \ to Madinah. In Madinah we regularly went for ziarat e Roza e Rasool. We had 10\
  \ days in Madinah and then we went back to Makkah and spend 3 to 4 more days.The\
  \ day came when we went back to home.Last time when I came from Haram I was like\
  \ I hold Kabbah in my one hand and someone was dragging me from my other hand to\
  \ went back to home and I did not want to go back. At that time the tears came in\
  \ my eyes.But at last we come back to home on Wednesday 6-2-2019. My mind and heart\
  \ is still there. This kind of feeling, those prayers, those peaceful places, those\
  \ lights etc I found there which I didn\u2019t expected."
