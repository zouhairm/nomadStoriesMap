Text: "I was in a small city called Salinas on the south coast of Ecuador. I was just\
  \ hanging with a local friend and surfing everyday before I started to head north.\
  \ I kept hearing about this wave that was really good and you couldn\u2019t surf\
  \ because you had to sneak through an air force base to get to.\n\nOne day my friend\
  \ was telling me it was going to be really good, so, we decided to try and sneak\
  \ in. In hindsight it was really stupid. We were crawling on our hands and knees\
  \ through some bushes on the bad side of a shooting range while they were actively\
  \ shooting. We made it to the beach got changed and ran for the ocean.\n\nWe were\
  \ in the water for all of 15 minutes when two large me with AK-47s appeared on the\
  \ beach and started to yell and whistle. We got a few more waves and went in. The\
  \ men were extremely un-impressed and very angry. We knew we were doing the wrong\
  \ thing but obviously played dumb. As we were about to get dragged off a man and\
  \ his wife came over a small dune and just walked up to us. The man asked us how\
  \ our day was and if we had a good surf we replied we did and he just smiled at\
  \ us and walked off. As he did my friend informed me that it was the President.\
  \ Everything happened so fast and in no time we were in the back of a military vehicle\
  \ being taken to a small building. I was out a short time later with a stern warning\
  \ never to return."
