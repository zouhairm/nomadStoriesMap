Text: "August 2019. In the waiting room of a bus terminal, I was sitting watching\
  \ the hands of the clock move silently around us.Soon the boarding was announced\
  \ and one by one we entered the bus. All the way, I created different scenes, curiosity,\
  \ nerves were part of my journey, but I knew how to master them.From my window I\
  \ could admire the tonalities of the fields, pastures, and my heart was shaken when\
  \ I saw a bridge. That bridge that I assumed was entering the state of Michoacan,\
  \ the lake of Cuitzeo surrounded us and we crossed in it. Herons, fishermen, lilies\
  \ on the road that lit up with the sunset. more roads passed, my joy grew. Suddenly\
  \ the driver left me in that place in which, many times I dreamed of knowing. Nahuatzen.\
  \ I arrived to a small town, cold and hoping to find a place to sleep, now we were\
  \ my backpack and I, walking on a desolate road in search of a hotel, I arrived\
  \ at a picturesque place, the first floor supermecado and the second floor called\
  \ hotel \"Xaracatan\" the only hotel in the whole town. Fortunately I found a room,\
  \ it was my lucky day. Nahuatzen was celebrating San Luis Rey de Francia, and its\
  \ streets full of lights, food vendors, rides were part of the festivity. But, I\
  \ was not going alone to that, I was going to find the roots of a Mexican sport,\
  \ El Jaripeo. The next day, I bought a ticket for the jaripeo and at 4 pm the access\
  \ began. The bullring was huge, white and red banisters, the cold with the fog our\
  \ atmosphere, we all took seats in the stands. began the presentation of the brave\
  \ riders dressed in their cowboy hat, colorful button-down shirts, boots,chaps \
  \ with different legends or their first names. Then came the rancher, owner of the\
  \ bulls, his team and finally the rodeo clowns. everyone in a circle took off their\
  \ hats and in a sign of respect began a prayer, While the announcer implored, the\
  \ riders of the riders, outlined the face upwards, raised their arms, others with\
  \ their fingers formed a cross in the earth, they crossed themselves as a sign of\
  \ protection. The announcer ended saying: \"Lord tell us: Rider your mount I have\
  \ given for good, Amen Amen Amen.\" After the band played a melody to finish and\
  \ we began to applaud. that afternoon the bullring was filled with traditions, came\
  \ the Marichas who are girls dressed in long, black plaid skirts, embroidered blouses\
  \ of images, long braids full of colored ribbons, and when the music entered the\
  \ bullring dancing and turning, in one hand a bull made of paper, in the other hand,\
  \ tickets to reward the courage of the rider, behind each girl their relatives,\
  \ who came with pyrotechnics, baskets full of clothes, fruit, alcohol, dancing.\
  \ Every twist of a deer caused a tear and a smile on my face. My journey continued\
  \ to Cher\xE1n, the only autonomous town in Michoacan. Murals on the streets, which\
  \ tell the bitter story of that April 15, 2011 that began the uprising of the town.\
  \ the Purepecha language is part of daily life, the purepecha flag with its four\
  \ colors, purple, blue, yellow and green, its shield of an obsidian block, four\
  \ groups of arrows, a white knife and a raised fist, under the motto Juchari Uinapekua\
  \ meaning \"Our Force\" waving along with the flag of Mexico. I felt safe in every\
  \ step I took, people were warm, and they felt proud when they saw tourists or journalists\
  \ recording their celebration of new administration. We caught sore faces, silences\
  \ in memory of those who became martyrs, teachers, carpenters, mothers, children,\
  \ our people. Michoacan has a treasure, that few of us have been able to find, sometimes\
  \ we think that the lights of the city, the buildings are magic, but I had the opportunity\
  \ to come across the richness of a language, of the dances, the warmth between the\
  \ mist and the drizzle in the mornings, the flavors of the lacustrine region.Michoacan\
  \ is great, Michoacan lets your treasure see the whole world with the same eyes\
  \ that I saw it."
