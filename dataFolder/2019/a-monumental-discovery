Text: "\u201CLove for mother, love for homeland.\u201D\n\nThe day I substituted my\
  \ tourist guide for a rickshaw puller, was the day I learned the history of Bibi-ka-Maqbara.\
  \ I was sitting on a scalding-hot cement log, behind me the walls of Bibi-ka-Maqbara\
  \ were inscribed with graffiti. I was calling my guide, while my phone screen stopped\
  \ responding due to my sweaty hands. It was close to 48 degrees, and the sun was\
  \ stabbing needles into my exposed arms. I could feel sweat rolling down my back\
  \ and my scalp, and I was internally cursing my guide. It was then that the Rickshaw\
  \ pulled up in front of me. He was an old man, so old that his brown eyes had turned\
  \ grey. The lines on his face were zagged, intersecting and crossed out, as if he\
  \ was a script in himself. His name was Riyadh, which in Arabic meant the springs\
  \ and oasis that travelers would usually stop at, after a long tiring journey. He\
  \ saw me wiping my sweat with the back of my kurta, which was already damp and sticking\
  \ to my arm. He politely asked me if I would like to sit in his auto while waiting\
  \ for my guide. I think he took pity on me: a tourist who had lost her way, her\
  \ guide, and soon her senses.\n\n\u201CHe destroyed other religions.\u201D\n\nAfter\
  \ the initial discussion of where I was from, he asked me if I knew about the history\
  \ of Bibi-Ka-Maqbara. I told him what little I knew; that the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb\u2019\
  s son had constructed the tomb in remembrance of his mother, who died during childbirth.\
  \  It had a similar story to that of the Taj Mahal, however, instead of husband\
  \ and wife, this tomb was built on the love of mother and child. Moreover, the tomb\u2019\
  s architecture was eerily similar to the architecture of the Taj Mahal.  Before\
  \ I could go on, he stopped me midway. He said this is precisely the information\
  \ that any tourist guide gives. He asked me bluntly, \u2018Is this a new story?\
  \ Is this the one that you want? Tombs are built everywhere; why come here? Go to\
  \ a graveyard, the inside of a church, a funeral home. No, this is not the story.\
  \ This story is about what every action, reaction, or monument is about: power\u201D\
  .\n\n \u201CLook upon my works ye mighty! And despair\u201D\n\nHe told me a version\
  \ of history that was convoluted, impregnated with hearsay, and lacked authentic\
  \ facts. The last thing he said to me was: \u201CYou know Aurangzeb killed his father\
  \ and his brothers so he could become the next emperor?\u201D \n\n\u201CTo be forgotten\
  \ is to be a memory.\u201D \n\nEven after days, after meeting my tourist guide,\
  \ listening to his watered down version, eating oily spring rolls wrapped in newspapers\
  \ and sipping chai in clay-glassi, riding camels while wearing full Rajasthani-traditional\
  \ dress, even after boarding the flight back home \u2013 I couldn\u2019t get Riyadh\u2019\
  s version out of my head. It followed me around; everywhere I traveled I searched\
  \ for local histories that would contradict \u201Creality.\u201D Although, no one\
  \ came close to the conviction that Riyadh had about monuments being less about\
  \ expression and more about economic power. It is 2016 now, Trump just announced\
  \ the longest wall that that will separate Mexico; or it is 2018, India just unveiled\
  \ the tallest statue in the world, a statue that has no significance to almost half\
  \ the population.  However, it is also 2010, and the people of Tokyo have unveiled\
  \ the statue of Hachiko, the dog who waited at Shibuya Station every day for the\
  \ return of his dead owner. All monuments; lost to tourism.\n\nOr it is 1669, and\
  \ Aurangzeb has just allocated a massive sum of money for the construction of Bibi-Ka-Maqbara.\
  \ A King is happy because generations will remember him; however, a son is grieving\
  \ but finds consolation in the fact that he would bury his mother. The monument\
  \ could be about power, but it\u2019s also an expression of pain from a motherless\
  \ child, and that\u2019s why it is timeless. \n\n\u201CTo her who accepted me, I\
  \ will always search for you within these walls.\u201D \n\n{All quotes are from\
  \ the graffiti-wall}"
