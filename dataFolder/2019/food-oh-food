Text: "\"If you go to Monywa, don't miss the samosa salad. It's typical and Monywa\
  \ is the best place to taste it!\"\nSo, who am I to disregard the local's suggestions?\n\
  I stop to one of the most popular restaurants strategically located in the dust\
  \ by the street. I take a seat while the owner cleans my table with a cloth so dirty\
  \ that I doubt it has ever seen a washing machine. To give you an idea, when I lift\
  \ my elbow from the table some skin was still glued to the table. \nAnyway. The\
  \ waitress comes by with my order, or at least what I thought I ordered, as I keep\
  \ forgetting that here, no matter what you want, it comes along with a soup and\
  \ 3kg of rice.\nOk, so. I am there, with enough dishes to feeda monastery, and in\
  \ my head I picture all the sentences I could hear if I was with some Italians,\
  \ like: \"what is that red thing?\", \"oh, I am going to get sick with all the spices\"\
  \ not to mention the most popular \"I am not going to eat in that dish that has\
  \ probaby being washed with the water from the river.\"\nYou know what? I don't\
  \ give a damn, and I eat. \nOh. My. God. \nWhy the hell hasn't anybody exported\
  \ Myanmar cuisine in Italy for exemple?! \nTasty, rich, mouthwatering! \nI literally\
  \ clean up all the dishes in the middle of the restaurant between the amazed looks\
  \ of the locals near me, who took photos, just to testify I was there and ate everything.\n\
  Well. What can I say?! \nI enjoyed the food, the people, the atmosphere.\nProbably\
  \ my mum will smell all the garlic even from the phone tonight when I call her,\
  \ but to be honest, here they put garlic even in the croissants, so I'm not bothered.\n\
  I still don't know if the dishes have been cleaned with the water from the river.\
  \ Maybe yes,and maybe I'll die. In any case, please remember I had fun, I enjoyed\
  \ every minute, that I have loved you and that I want to be cremated in Varanasi.\n\
  Thank you soooooo much."
