Text: "A leap into the unknown of the traveling Earthlover19 by Roksana Priest. \n\
  Who\u2019s open to different experience through my own journey of life. To go far\
  \ and beyond my horizon, to capture the moments the are unforgettable and to understand\
  \ the depth of my own meaning of what my purpose in life is. Holding the world is\
  \ in my hands, to be able to go into a unknown place, with no expectations but to\
  \ have a heart, mind and soul, that\u2019s ready for for all a human being, like\
  \ myself wants. My travel story has already begun in my young years of life on earth,\
  \ as I decided to bring my own fears and move to a different unknow place for a\
  \ year and half. Experiencing a different culture and being placed into a whole\
  \ new world for myself... was extraordinary. Even though I had much fear of stepping\
  \ out of my comfort zone, I knew my life was suppose to be about the different experiences\
  \ I should and can have. Since I was a little girl, My parents wanted me to experience\
  \ traveling... especially with them! Once I stepped out, I have never not wanted\
  \ to step back in. It\u2019s a thrill with excitement but with fear. If I didn\u2019\
  t have fear, I wouldn\u2019t push myself to try new things. The older I get the\
  \ more and more my soul is becoming free and aware of the world in my hands. Not\
  \ in front of me but it\u2019s in my hands to do these things. Being connected with\
  \ the world, no matter where! Everyday I\u2019m learning to be in touch with myself\
  \ and where I am, is absolutely beautiful. I see myself growing, learning and challenging\
  \ my own abilities. It\u2019s crazy to think that I am 1 human out of roughly 7.63\
  \ billion other people on this earth. There\u2019s so many souls, that I want to\
  \ encounter through my travels, who have a heart and soul like myself. Open to all\
  \ things, with no judgment but love, peace and happiness. With no expectations but\
  \ only to live life to the fullest of our own capability. I\u2019ve only seen so\
  \ little of the world that\u2019s in my hands, yet, I\u2019m ready for another experience\
  \ so I can grow more to where I feel I can be. Being aware of your life and surrounding,\
  \ and learning what and where you want to go next is, is definitely a leap into\
  \ the unknown!"
