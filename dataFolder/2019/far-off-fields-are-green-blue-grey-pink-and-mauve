Text: "Have you ever heard the antiquated expression 'far off fields may look green'\
  \ from a parent with the desire for you not to relocate to another country?  Me\
  \ too.  And I struggled on my Erasmus year in Zaragoza, Spain.  Yet, in a remarkable\
  \ twist to the tale, my struggles and anguish became the very reason the travel\
  \ bug festered and blossomed.  As I meandered across the perfectly finished, immaculate\
  \ stone grounds of La Basilica de Nuestra Se\xF1ora del Pilar in Zaragoza, the capital\
  \ of Aragon, I considered that this isn't exactly what I had anticipated for my\
  \ year abroad.  And I realised that was okay.  I realised that there is spectacular\
  \ beauty in any place and country, you just have to be willing to find it and embrace\
  \ it.\n\nCulturally, the pace of life was one that was different to what I was used\
  \ to in the North of Ireland.  Culturally, it was different from any holiday or\
  \ beach travel I had embarked on in the past and envisioned myself doing on my Erasmus\
  \ year.  From banging into a woman who cursed me and rushed past me in the supermarket\
  \ as I stared wild-eyed and terrified at the groceries around me contemplating how\
  \ I could ever get by without my mother, to going around the city to teach Spanish\
  \ families and their kids English- these experiences which terrified me at the start\
  \ were actually the things that made my experience worthwhile.  They showed me that\
  \ even when you feel at your most low, it doesn't matter if those far off fields\
  \ are green, blue, grey, pink or MAUVE- if you want to make travel something you\
  \ enjoy and see yourself doing for the rest of your life, the hard times have to\
  \ be endured and you have to immerse yourself in every aspect of life to find the\
  \ true beauty of what travelling does for the soul. \n\nAlthough not stereotypically\
  \ Spanish, Zaragoza was a very residential city, with not many people who spoke\
  \ English.  And this is what I found most awe-inspiring.  I picked up on phrases,\
  \ I was taken care of by the families I acquainted myself with, I ate tapas, I established\
  \ friendships with the most wonderful people from Germany, Greece, Italy and everywhere\
  \ in between.  \n\nAnd most importantly I used it as a base to travel around Spain\
  \ and to parts of Italy.  I grew confidence in hopping on a bus, communicating in\
  \ Spanish which was fast growing to be my second language, and finding myself in\
  \ many different places, as my travel experience and bucketlist continued becoming\
  \ better and better.  And I grew with it.  Sounds clich\xE9 I know- but I truly\
  \ believe that adopting a different language and seeing different chapters in the\
  \ book of planet earth makes you a better person, more equipped to deal with life's\
  \ hardships and twists and turns.  \n\nWhere I lived for that year might not have\
  \ all been palm trees and flamenco and sandy beaches.  And neither is life.  Yes,\
  \ you can go there and enjoy these things, but it proved to me that I should never\
  \ embark on my travels with limited expectations and a narrow-minded view.  Sometimes,\
  \ off the beaten track is actually the most fascinating way to travel.  For me,\
  \ now, it is more about the company, the possibilities, and the immersion in a life\
  \ very different from my own.  And a renewed love and fascination for writing- by\
  \ documenting my adventures and every little detail which made the travelling special\
  \ for me.\n\nTo be honest, before I came to Zaragoza, I saw far off fields as green.\
  \  When I came back home, I saw a kaleidoscope of colour in those far off fields,\
  \ and an open mind in terms of what to expect as I continue to travel the world\
  \ and seek moving abroad for another period of time.  And I could not be more grateful\
  \ for this insight.  Pi\xE9rdete en el mundo y encu\xE9ntrate contigo mismo. \u2013\
