Text: "Up to this point (I'm in my 50's), I had only traveled for leisure with a partner\
  \ of some kind - my spouse, a friend, or family member. But I REALLY wanted to visit\
  \ Ecuador and check it out as a possible retirement destination, and none of my\
  \ usual 'go-to' people were available.\nHaving done some advance research, I decided\
  \ to visit Cuenca and Cotacachi for the mountains, and Manta and Salinas for the\
  \ beaches. My trip included renting a car in Guayaquil and driving first up through\
  \ the hills to Manta, and then down the coastline to Salinas. I planned enough time\
  \ that I could stop and explore some of the smaller beach towns along the way.\n\
  Here's what I learned about driving in Ecuador:\na) Dedicated lanes are an amusing\
  \ North American notion;\nb) Road signs are only posted for those who already know\
  \ where they're going,     and\nc) No matter how slowly you think you are going,\
  \ there's always somebody up ahead going slower than you!\n\nI was a little nervous\
  \ (at first) about going solo, especially with the miles I planned to cover. But\
  \ I had a wonderful time, and the Ecuadorean people were friendly and helpful, and\
  \ very patient with my limited Spanish.\n\nThe three biggest highlights of my trip\
  \ were : \n1) Spending a whole day at a fantastic hot springs spa near Cuenca, called\
  \ Piedra di Agua\n2) Finding the perfect 'goldilocks' beach town (not too big, not\
  \ too small, but just right) called Olon (about 5 minutes drive north of the main\
  \ surfer town of Monta\xF1ita\n3) Going to the Saturday market in Otavalo (short\
  \ bus ride from Cotacachi) -  the largest textile market in South America - and\
  \ finding some fantastic bargains on alpaca wool shawls and blankets.\n\nEcuador\
  \ is so beautiful, with so many varied environments - and very easy on the pocketbook!\
  \ \nTraveling alone actually worked out better for me, as I met several wonderful\
  \ people and had many great conversations - with other foreign travelers as well\
  \ as with locals. I'll definitely be back, and wouldn't hesitate to recommend the\
  \ country to other solo women travelers like me.\n\nNext time in Ecuador, maybe\
  \ I'll be able to fit in a trip to the Galapagos!"
