Text: "The desert had never been a place I thought I would see myself, I always felt\
  \ a call to the water instead, and I always hated the extreme heat. That all changed\
  \ when I took a random business class to study abroad in the Middle East. I was\
  \ studying Arabic and knew a little about the culture, but it wasn't a place I ever\
  \ thought of myself living or enjoying so much. Going with my best friend, I had\
  \ a blast visiting local sights and learning more about the culture, but the more\
  \ I learned about the culture, the more I learned about myself. \nOn one of the\
  \ first days we were there, we visited the fort of Sheik Zayed the First in Abu\
  \ Dhabi. I didn't think much of it, the bright, all white fort was a historical\
  \ building smack dab in the middle of the skyscraper city, but the hidden museum\
  \ inside would play a big part in my life that I never expected. Stories of the\
  \ first Sheik and clothing from the beginning of the country lined the walls, it\
  \ was an information overload as Arabic music played and videos danced on the white\
  \ walls. But it was in that moment I got lost in the past and in myself. A video\
  \ was playing of people sitting in the desert under the moonlight, wind blowing\
  \ their loose clothing and fire cooking their food. That video sparked a fire within\
  \ my soul, it took me back to the time the video was representing, but it also took\
  \ me to a time within myself, a part of me that knew this world and this history,\
  \ a part of me that was there. This nanosecond of a video imprinted itself on my\
  \ soul and stayed with me for the rest of the trip. The more places we visited,\
  \ the more this spark grew within me. I found more of myself in the Louvre museum,\
  \ looking at the Roads of Arabia exhibit with broken statues, painted vases, and\
  \ scribed tombstones brought me back to that feeling that I belong here, that I\
  \ had been here before and it was time for me to return. Our trip led us to Dubai\
  \ next where my classmates and I decided we had to get the most of our cultural\
  \ experience and go on a Safari Adventure. The rolling sands of the desert reminded\
  \ me of the crashing ocean waves as we drove over the dunes, screaming and laughing\
  \ together. During our adventure in the open desert, we were introduced to a traditional\
  \ Arabic dinner and show. We sat on pillows on small tables close to the ground,\
  \ we were treated like royalty and smoked the traditional shisha with our meal.\
  \ During the show of twirling dervishes, fire blowing, and belly dancing, I was\
  \ again thrown into the past of my traveling soul and felt like I found my home.\
  \ My heart and mind were eager to know more about this culture and these wonderful\
  \ people.\nTwo weeks was too soon to leave, there were so many more places to explore,\
  \ but I know that those sparks in my heart will bring me back to where I am meant\
  \ to be. I knew the language, didn't agree with the religion, but I found a part\
  \ of myself and a yearning to be in the desert that I never expected to find. I\
  \ have learned that even when you think you know yourself, there could be parts\
  \ of you hidden deeper than you imagined. This is why I am now such an advocate\
  \ for traveling, the place you were born may not be where you are supposed to stay\
  \ and you will always learn more about yourself by learning about others. I will\
  \ never stop traveling and I will never stop finding more of myself within my travels\
  \ and within the beautiful and many cultures of the world."
