Text: "Heading to the manic city, I made a promise to breathe into my life. A major\
  \ city would be difficult to integrate, so I opted for Hualien, Taiwan. An ocean\
  \ town with a quick escape to a National Park if I felt myself returning to the\
  \ edge. \n\nWithin the first few days I found a bed and breakfast run by an independent\
  \ woman. I closed my eyes to the jungle I left and opened them to the late nights\
  \ of the blue screen. \u201COk one more hour and she'll be all caught up,\u201D\
  \ I justified to myself. I returned to the life of a cyborg; sending emails, working\
  \ on social media and marketing, aimless scrolling. Addiction, luring me in quicker,\
  \ my excuse was to help the fearless angel who worked hard for her business. She\
  \ deserved a break. Waking up with a mild technology hangover. I walked into town\
  \ surrounded by warm laughs as I cold and unable to curl-up the corners of my mouth.\
  \ Spotting a scooter without hesitation I rented it for a trek into the mountains.\
  \ \n\n  Reaching headquarters I stopped to ask for information, despite knowing\
  \ well what I wanted. \u201CClosed\u201D, the rangers told me. Far off in the distance,\
  \ the hot spring is under construction and closed? Not the answer I was willing\
  \ to accept. \nAgain, I put my faith now in Google maps. Reroute after reroute.\
  \ Something was pushing me further away, taking me offline. A month prior I left\
  \ to the jungle to disconnect allowing myself to return to balance. My imbalance\
  \ bringing rise to a buzzing mind searching for an absolute truth and a low of connection\
  \ to within, searching for my destination beyond myself. Shaking off the crutch,\
  \ I threw my phone in my sack, gaining my first step back into my power. Tracing\
  \ back over the bridge, for one more glimpse of the trail map; staring into its\
  \ depths, waiting for the hot spring to call me. \n\n\u201CHaaah!\u201D a stout\
  \ Taiwanese man signaling me. Bringing me out of my trance back on track, waving\
  \ me over in the right direction. Shooting past us, a monkey lead me toward the\
  \ acceptance of his gentle offering. \n\nAnxiety high, mirroring my proximity to\
  \ the river below me. My heart yearning to be amidst the flow. Squeezing our bodies\
  \ through a tight locked fence, I once overlooked we repelled down the marble face\
  \ holding onto a cable cord. Feet touching the ground, taking a few steps left,\
  \ and tucking safely into our cave. State box seating for Mother Earth\u2019s  spectacular\
  \ show. Turning around to view my new friend face down, floating, and back burning\
  \ red hot.  Was he meditating or had he passed over dead? \n\nTesting the water,\
  \ going back and forth dipping my toe in and out, I chose the second less scalding\
  \ of the pools. I no longer had my phone attached to me to tell me was this ok or\
  \ should I go that way, yet I was still questioning what I felt. As I lowered my\
  \ head closer to the water it began to muffle my thoughts, heightening my senses.\
  \ The warm touch of the water enveloping me. Pushing myself to the edge, further\
  \ and further, until one last deep breath from within my belly. Surrendering. Submerging\
  \ my body fully in. Pulses surging my senses with a revitalizing energy. Stillness,\
  \ exhaling all pent up attachment. Coming up for air, gazing into the coursing essence\
  \ of, the gorge. Nature had blocked any distraction, as I sat inward feeling into\
  \ the space, reaching back into my intuition. With a slight whizzing of an orange\
  \ I reflexively turned hand out catching his invitation to be open now. Biting,\
  \ tasting love. Warm tears rolling down my cheeks as the trust ran through me, my\
  \ inner guidance replenished. A flow of connection to all around the world. My acceptance\
  \ to the divisionless actions from him to me, me to him, mother, friends, even strangers.\
  \ His love, their love, transmitted through nature, through nonverbal communication,\
  \ offerings. My disconnection from my metaphysical state when I disconnected from\
  \ the grid. Nature extends understanding of energy in Taroko National Park I took\
  \ on this embodiment of a metaphysical love."
