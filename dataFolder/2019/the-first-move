Text: "Staring at the squared pattern of one more empty Excel page at work, thinking\
  \ about my first move on it, I realized that I liked everything I had. \nI really\
  \ did; I liked my job (even though I didn\u2019t apply for it), my friends (consequences\
  \ of social interactions that I let happened), my family (the result of genetics,\
  \ or adoption...we never know)....but (don\u2019t you just love the but? And the\
  \ parenthesis). \nThat infinit Excel pattern screamed to my face that all these\
  \ things had came to me. I had passivly agreed to them, I\u2019d let them become\
  \ my hole life. They had made the first move on me. Even the city I lived in was\
  \ not my work! I was the empty canvas.\nI couldn\u2019t Stand it, I needed to choose.\
  \ \nNow, logics says we cannot \xAB\_choose\_\xBB if we don\u2019t have options.\
  \ So I packed a bag, did some papers and came out to the world to meet my options;\
  \ to make lots of first moves.\nI\u2019ve departed from Buenos Aires ten months\
  \ ago, and ever since I\u2019ve met with adventure every day. \nI find the balance\
  \ between choosing\u2019and letting things come in the island of Corse, France.\n\
  I arrived here by boat, from Italy. I didn\u2019t know what it was like, since I\u2019\
  d never seen a picture before. I didn\u2019t speak the language, I had no acquantances,\
  \ or job, or enough money. \nBut standing on that boat, moving forward to the cost,\
  \ gett\xEEng closer and closer to an option was the most \xAB\_first move\_\xBB\
  \ I had ever felt."
