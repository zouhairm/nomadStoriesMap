Text: "The sun was low, and the sky was clear. The ground: burnt orange, alien if\
  \ you come from a place where the ground isn\u2019t orange. Growing from this alien\
  \ earth were olive trees, trunks twisting towards the sky and bursting into clouds\
  \ of small, silvery green leaves. In the far distance were the snow-capped Atlas\
  \ Mountains. I was on a bus to Marrakech.\n\nI took my camera out of my bag. The\
  \ picture I took wasn\u2019t quite right, so I took another. It wasn\u2019t right,\
  \ either,\_and I thought to myself that the camera must be calibrated to less vibrant\
  \ environments, to\_duller moments. I spent the three-hour ride staring out the\
  \ window, awed by the landscape, a James Turrell installation on a grand scale.\
  \ \n\n----\n\nIn Marrakech I turned to textiles to capture the landscape that the\
  \ camera could not. On my first night in the city, walking back to the riad from\_\
  Jemaa el-Fnaa\u2013the medina\u2019s main\_square and marketplace\u2013I stopped\
  \ at a small, tidy shop on a quiet street\_selling an assortment of items: dusty\
  \ tea services, brass trays, silver boxes, old photographs. \u201CEs salaam alaykum,\u201D\
  \ said the shopkeeper, looking up from his newspaper. In reply, I mumbled something\_\
  that I hoped was close enough to a proper response. My Arabic is a work in progress.\
  \ Piled on top of two low\_stools were rugs, carefully folded and stacked to keep\
  \ them from falling to the floor. \n\nMuhammed, the shopkeeper, was a professorial-looking\
  \ man; he was wearing a tweed jacket with patches on the elbows to match.\_I bent\
  \ to look at the rugs and he leapt from his chair in the corner of the shop. He\
  \ unfolded rug after rug, laying each carefully on the floor. One piece, not a rug\
  \ at all but a thick blanket, caught my eye. Woven with wool and goat hair, it resembled\
  \ the earth that was burnt into my memory: madder-dyed wool and interwoven with\
  \ mimosa-colored thread, there was a variation in the weave the mimicked the natural\
  \ variation of the landscape. The blanket was marked with a wasm symbol, typical\
  \ of the nomadic tribes of the Tennsift River region between Marrakech and the Atlantic\
  \ Coast.\n\n----\n\nMustapha\u2019s shop was across from the Palais de Bahia, a\
  \ grand\_palace and surrounding gardens, built in the late 19th century and a stop\
  \ on the Marrakech tourist circuit. In complete contrast to Muhammed\u2019s small\
  \ shop, here the rugs were piled high on a concrete floor and lit by fluorescent\
  \ light.\n \nShopping for rugs in Morocco is almost magical. Not only are the rugs\
  \ handmade and beautiful, but all you\_have to do is touch a rug and the laws of\
  \ physics disappear. With the slightest indication of interest, the rug is in the\
  \ air with a force out of scale with your light touch. It\u2019s spread upon the\
  \ floor, and from somewhere behind you comes a voice:\_\u201CBeautiful, yes?\u201D\
  \ The voice is Mustapha's, the man defying your gravity and trying to make a sale.\
  \ Before long what was once a bland, warehouse-like space is transformed into a\
  \ Bedouin tent. You\u2019re offered a mint tea. \n\nThe rugs of Morocco are unique.\
  \ Every shopkeeper will tell you this. But many of the rugs sold to tourists are\
  \ based on a traditional Berber design that is ubiquitous in the souqs. After many,\
  \ many iterations of I-have-the-perfect-rug-for-you-my-friend, Mustapha unfurled\
  \ a rug that was, well, unique. Whereas traditional\_Berber rugs have a tight geometric\
  \ pattern and are often burgundy in color\u2013symbolizing luck\u2013this one had\
  \ a looser design and was predominantly blue, almost turquoise, and the color of\
  \ the desert sky I\u2019d been looking for. Differing horizontal bands of geometric\
  \ shapes in black, white, teal, and yellow marked it in style of the Oulad Bou Sbaa,\
  \ also in the region between Marrakech and Essouira. \n\n----\n\n\u201CI don\u2019\
  t change the color of the sky,\u201D writes Turrell, \u201Cbut I change the context\
  \ of vision.\u201D The context of vision, in this case, was along a highway far\
  \ from home. The language was foreign, as was the landscape, and even many of the\
  \ colors. And yet, the sky was still blue."
