Text: "The story I'm about to share happened in 2007, during my frist trip abroad.\
  \ I had always wanted to live in another  country and experience a new culture.\
  \ Since I started to learn English at the age of 12, I decided to pursue the dream\
  \ in London. \xCC was, of course, very excited about the chance and the challenges\
  \ ahead, being the first one the application process and saving the money, and really\
  \ making up my own mind. \nFirstly I got really impressed by the fact that in most\
  \ cities there are not only the local but also a great number of foreigners who\
  \ go there in order to study, work and start over. Being from a small town, I had\
  \ never met many people from other languages and cultures, even though the racial\
  \ diversity in my home country is impressive, we all share the same language and\
  \ cultural aspects, whereas in some places it is possible to meet a whole immigrant\
  \ community, preserving their language, culture and religion.\nThen this whole new\
  \ opportunity is enriching for providing me to get to know the local, as well as,\
  \ those who came there to live. People like me, who might never have the chance\
  \ to meet so many different culture at once, and experiencing to hear another language,\
  \ trying another food, and learn from those immigrant about their own country.\n\
  Certainly, visiting the country and meeting the locals is good enough, especially\
  \ when one travels to a nation distant from their homeland. One of the factors that\
  \ I consider the most relevant is the possibility to confirm expectations and get\
  \ rid of preconceived ideas one may have based on stereotypes. Sadly they are very\
  \ common and hard to eradicate and only when you chance to meet a person who is\
  \ aware of such knowledge or is part of the group affected you are able to change\
  \ your views.\nMy experience enabled me to get to know people from different background\
  \ and I couldn't be happier than that. It went beyong linguistic or geographic learning,\
  \ it was the opportunity to study a bit about the world every day."
