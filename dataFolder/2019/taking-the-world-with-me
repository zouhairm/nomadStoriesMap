Text: "Im looking at the mountains around the Falkner lake, located in Argentinian\u2019\
  s Patagonia. \u201CLooking at\u201D is an understatement, I\u2019m actually admiring\
  \ them: they are enormous with their sharp peaks extremely defined against the blue\
  \ sky, I can even spot little snow at the top, which I find a little odd given the\
  \ fact that down here the sun is hitting hard and the heat is making the sand burn.\
  \ \nIm feeling empowered, the hugeness of my surroundings is not the kind of enormity\
  \ that makes you feel small, on the contrary, it\u2019s inviting, it makes you feel\
  \ as if one day you can be as present and majestic and enormous as they are, as\
  \ you can achieve anything you wanted to. I look to my side and I see a group of\
  \ friends around my age starting the fire for the night, I can now estimate that\
  \ the sun is about to go behind the lake and turn the sky into a beautiful painting,\
  \ giving the space and time now to let the moon and the stars shine.\nAs this is\
  \ about to happen and go cold, I go back to my tent and spot my friends laughing\
  \ about some random thing, and I smile, I take in this moment so that I can remember\
  \ it as the time when we were young, happy and unstoppable.\nThe night approaches\
  \ and it\u2019s time for us to start the fire, so we can warm ourselves and cook\
  \ the food. The nights get really cold here in the camping compared to the city,\
  \ but luckily we are having a big plate of pasta that makes us stop from shivering.\
  \ We have dinner and talks around the fire, somehow the night and darkness brings\
  \ out our most vulnerable side, the masks we have during the day disappear so that\
  \ we can share our deepest selves, dreams and fears with each other. I listen and\
  \ share my opinions, my views and let new people discover myself, just as they let\
  \ me discover them: from strangers to confidents.\nAs we look up to the sky we see\
  \ millions of stars shining for us, the lights of the city cant get here but who\
  \ needs them when we can have this marvelous illumination? Time passes by and between\
  \ beers, songs, laughs and hugs I can only wish that this moment could last forever.\
  \ \nI never imagined that being around nature could change us, inspire us, make\
  \ us feel better, feel REAL.\nSince I was very young I never really knew who I wanted\
  \ to be in this world: what career should I follow, what work should I have or even\
  \ what kind of family I wanted to form. But there was one thing I have always been\
  \ certain about, I wanted to be an inspiring woman. And now I know how: by taking\
  \ the world with me."
