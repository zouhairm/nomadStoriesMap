Text: "It was an acutely sensory moment: complete awareness of my body and the forces\
  \ acting on it. I felt floor-tiles etching patterns on my criss-crossed thighs,\
  \ droplets of water tracing lazy paths down my back, the meat of an Asian pear crunching\
  \ juicily in my mouth. Steam did little to conceal my naked body, or that of the\
  \ woman mirroring me at this unconventional indoor picnic. Kids munching happily\
  \ on tteok rice cake ran around us sans clothes, their chatter drowned out by the\
  \ sound of running water and my nagging worry they would slip on the wet floor.\
  \ \n\nThis was a jjimjilbang: a Korean public bathhouse. We\u2019d come here for\
  \ a day of self-care, and apparently a day of snacking.\n\nLiving with a host family,\
  \ you have to expect a certain amount of transparency.  I knew to expect this adjustment\
  \ period, but I was exhausted. There was constant homogeneity in Korea, manifested\
  \ in stares and whispers of waygookin, foreigner. I was eager for a familiar relationship\
  \ with my new hosts, so I had agreed to a weekend outing. I anticipated getting\
  \ to know each other, but I hadn\u2019t expected to be literally nude.\n\nOn this\
  \ first Saturday together, my host mom Ayoung (who insisted on her English name\
  \ Viki,) brought us to the 7th floor of a densely stacked high-rise. You almost\
  \ needed a guide to locate and navigate this self-care obstacle course. We shed\
  \ our clothes in increments: a small locker for shoes, a larger one for clothes,\
  \ and without ceremony we were naked. Viki and the kids strolled to the locker room\
  \ convenience store to buy hard-boiled eggs and face serums, and I hurriedly draped\
  \ the tiny towel between my legs and followed them into my first jjimjilbang. \n\
  \nMy prior experiences in public nudity being ornate hammams and Mediterranean nude\
  \ beaches, the jjimjilbang\u2019s simplicity surprised me. It was an unassuming\
  \ place, sequestered from K-pop and Instagram\u2019s ever-present beauty standards\
  \ and selfie filters. It was an open space with showers and vanities, heated pools,\
  \ saunas, an ice room. It was a public space, like parks or libraries, except it\
  \ was segregated by gender and no one was wearing clothes.  \n\nI hesitantly removed\
  \ my towel and sat on a plastic stool at the showers, following Viki\u2019s lead\
  \ without looking lower than her shoulders. Condensation from the low ceiling dripped\
  \ on my mirror, reflecting the 80-year-old ahjumma behind me. She scrubbed herself\
  \ down with an intensity not totally unsurprising for someone who had weathered\
  \ the trauma of the Korean War and the rapid technological advances that followed.\
  \ \n\nRetrieving my towel, I walked with the kids to the heated pools. I was struck\
  \ by the ages and shapes around me, more bodies that were never fully visible back\
  \ home. Their shapes soaking in the medicinal mugwort bath next to mine, I relaxed\
  \ as the pretense and formality that had troubled me so far in Korea faded. \n\n\
  Ahjummas in their 70s reclined on plastic lawn chairs to the soundtrack of kids\
  \ splashing and mothers gossiping. The generation gap disappeared and we moved through\
  \ the processes of existing in a physical form, regardless of skin color or the\
  \ number of wrinkles it possessed. At the jjimjilbang, bodies were neither aesthetic\
  \ nor visual. Bodies were there for care, for maintenance, for a rest from incessant\
  \ flashing neon and 60-hour work-weeks.\n\nGathering my courage, I temporarily wandered\
  \ from my crew. Despite being the only foreigner, I was invited into this intimate\
  \ feminine community. The girls who offered shy English \u201Chellos,\u201D in exchange\
  \ for checking out my tattoos. The 20-something who reached over smiling to press\
  \ the jet button I had missed. The 40-somethings who attentively shifted on the\
  \ sauna bench, gesturing for me to lay down. The ahjumma in her 80s who paused a\
  \ massage to hand me a fresh towel after I dropped mine. \n\nWrapping the towel\
  \ absentmindedly around my wet hair, I re-joined my hosts for the picnic. Soon we\
  \ would change into cotton uniforms and transition to the co-ed recreational space\
  \ where we would nap on heated floors, have another snack, watch K-dramas. But my\
  \ thoughts would linger awhile in the steam, a place where I didn\u2019t feel quite\
  \ so naked anymore."
