Text: "Outside, the dark purple air is alive with the sound of birds. Their wings\
  \ flutter away in the face of company and I sip my scalding tea slowly, trying not\
  \ to let it burn my mouth. I am alone. Not for the first time, but now I really\
  \ feel it. An apprehension of being far away from everything I\u2019ve ever known\
  \ settles like a cloak over my skin. I\u2019ve dreamt of this moment in multitudes\
  \ and am pleased to realize that it feels exactly like I thought it would, only\
  \ better. The air tastes different, the wind sends a shiver of adrenaline down to\
  \ my toes. Scents of spices and spirits all hit me at once and the spell is complete,\
  \ I become bewitched by cobblestones and hot-spun sugar. \nThe night crystallizes\
  \ and I drive blurry-eyed on a highway that winds and furls around a flection of\
  \ trees. It narrowly misses the city, which is illuminated by prismatic windows\
  \ and signs against a quickly darkening sky. I\u2019m struck by how large the buildings\
  \ are, they expand upwards and outwards with an iconic poise and the sounds of metropolis\
  \ buzz through my open windows. Its pull grows smaller as I put distance between\
  \ us and continue to go east, only half unsure of where it will lead me. I\u2019\
  ve been wanting things for a while, molding my desire into a palm-sized stone that\
  \ fits perfectly in my pocket but I\u2019ve been waiting long enough. I drive on\
  \ past grazing animals and crooked forests until the stars unfurl before me, dotting\
  \ the sky with their glow. \nFor me, the world collapses all the time, transforms\
  \ into something else. I am always going. The vibration of the world around me is\
  \ ever-changing and up until now, I had fit myself into its flux always on the arm\
  \ of another. Not this time. This is the first time I\u2019ve gone anywhere far\
  \ truly by myself, and Spain stretches its arms out to me like an old friend. That\
  \ night, I eat alone. The ham on crusted bread is sliced thinly and perfectly salted,\
  \ my palette is grateful for something recognizable yet utterly new. Jazz lilts\
  \ over the tiny speakers in the restaurant and the waiter slides me a sympathetic\
  \ glass of wine; I\u2019m the only unaccompanied diner. \nI toss and turn in a tiny\
  \ cot and awake before the sun is up, burnt coffee and a bagel sate me before I\
  \ make my way to my first and favorite destination. When I reach the ocean I lose\
  \ my breath. The bluff is eroding and the waves hit the shore with ferocity; I envision\
  \ myself suspended above a lick of blue. I followed my vulnerability into a land\
  \ of cosmic wonder. I walk on the edge of solitude with my feet in the water, shoals\
  \ of cold bright seashells glitter in the distance. I discovered there was something\
  \ unfamiliar and consoling, how strange and humbling it is to feel small on the\
  \ precipice of a shore I\u2019ve never seen before. The sea is the only woman I\
  \ really love."
