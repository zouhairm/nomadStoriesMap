Text: "My heart pounds, tears stream down my face, and I whimper to my husband as\
  \ he drives me to the airport 'I can't do this, I have to stay' \n\n6 months ago,\
  \ I had applied for a teaching position I didn't think I'd get in a country 3000\
  \ miles away from my own. Between the interviews, tests, and paperwork for visas,\
  \ it was exciting but terrifying. I've never been much. I worked in retail, restaurants,\
  \ sanitation, and had a brief stint as a tattoo artist. Now I've got one of the\
  \ most amazing opportunities available. \n\nI never thought I would get the job,\
  \ so when my Visa arrived my heart was awash with 1 million emotions. Of course\
  \ I applied to the job but actually having to go now that I'm in a contractual agreement\
  \ overseas is overwhelming. Ive never been on plane, I didn't even get to cross\
  \ the street by myself until I was in university! How am I supposed to travel to\
  \ a foreign country by myself for an entire year when I had little understanding\
  \ of language, customs, or culture?\n\nI was numb when I got on that plane. I didnt\
  \ know what to do or how to feel or how things would play out. I spent 32 hours\
  \ on planes and layovers just thinking about how things were going to be. How was\
  \ I going to survive alone, with no prior experience?\n\nHere's the secret to travel.\
  \ You're never truly alone. Sure, if you're at the peak of a mountain, or in the\
  \ bottom of a gorge, there might be nobody around. But somebody before you was exactly\
  \ where you stand.\nMaybe scared, maybe struggling. Someone else found their way\
  \ and you can too.\n\nI was never truly alone during my time here in Japan. So many\
  \ times, a local would see me struggling and, despite the language barrier they\
  \ helped me in every way possible to get me where I was trying to go. My first day\
  \ here, I couldn't even figure out how to ride a train to my new apartment, so a\
  \ local spent 15 minutes trying to help me find the way. My maps failed me once\
  \ in a Mountain Village so a little old man traveled with me for 2 miles.\n\nIt's\
  \ been a year since I came to Japan and I'm the one helping others now. I helped\
  \ two elder women to the train station on my way home from work, Ive cooperated\
  \ in speaking performances, I've run marathons for charity, I've traveled to dozens\
  \ of cities and met hundreds of people. I'm not a master travel, I'm not the master\
  \ of anything, but who cares? The most important thing is to step outside, get away\
  \ from your comfort zone, to make the world a smaller place. Nobody is the true\
  \ master of anything, but when we take a moment to step out and greet our fellow\
  \ man, we become closer and we can accomplish anything."
