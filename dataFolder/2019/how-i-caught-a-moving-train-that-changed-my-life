Text: "It felt as though I was the actress of cinematic masterpiece as I was running\
  \ through a post communist train station with several other young women in our group.\
  \ I don\u2019t think at the time I realized this trip would change my life. \n\n\
  \ It seemed as if everything was going in slow motion. We had at least 3 months\
  \ worth of gear and clothes strapped to our backs as we ran as fast as our 18 year\
  \ old hearts could take us. We got to the train and it was moving slowly at first\
  \ as we piled onto the back. Then it started picking up speed as I saw our interpreter\
  \ jump on and several of our friends. Finally I was pulled on by several of the\
  \ girls and turned around and helped pull on the last girl. \n\nWow, I didn\u2019\
  t expect such an amazing introduction to Poland! We had just taken a ferry from\
  \ England and rode a bus several days to the edge of Poland. Our interpreter said\
  \ we had plenty of time to get to the train to take us to a small town, Krynica.\
  \ You can\u2019t tell a bunch of young girls they have plenty of time, which he\
  \ will most likely never do again. \n\nWe were there to help set up an after school\
  \ program in this small town to help them curb the drug and alcohol abuse happening\
  \ among the bored children. Even though I didn\u2019t have much time to learn the\
  \ language after finding out the country we were being sent to, we learned so much\
  \ from them and their culture! \n\nWe stayed with an elderly woman in a three story\
  \ box looking home that she rented out to make a living. After communism had fallen\
  \ the elderly no longer had a system in place to help them financially so they had\
  \ to come up with other ideas to fill the gaps once provided by the government.\
  \ She would tell us stories about World War II that were more fascinating than the\
  \ lastest blockbuster movie on the screen. \n\nThis house was up on a hill and we\
  \ would daily walk into the small town to get groceries, go out to eat, see the\
  \ different tourist attractions. The town was a big tourist hot spot in the communism\
  \ era and you could see the remnants of that evidence in the beautiful ski lifts,\
  \ large hotels, and water fountains. \n\nOne day we went on a tour of the natural\
  \ mineral water that comes from the town. We were given these odd looking ceramic\
  \ mugs to dip into a well. Can I just tell you this water was horrid! Later found\
  \ out that it hadn\u2019t yet been filtered. (Safe to drink just not filtered) We\
  \ all took a sip and spit it out as it was full of sulfur giving it a gaseous taste.\
  \ It was not appetizing at all, but very comical I imagine to see about 15 young\
  \ women simultaneously spit water out!\n\nThe Polish people we met at the time around\
  \ 1999 were still rebuilding from communism\u2019s collapse. Many of them took it\
  \ on as a challenge and were finding joy and humor in the small things. Like running\
  \ through a train station with a group of girls or getting them to try sulfur water.\
  \ They were excited about their future and so were we.\n\n Many aspects of this\
  \ journey have been etched deep into my heart and for that Poland will always bring\
  \ a smile to my face as a very unexpected place to find joy and beauty in the midst\
  \ of such a troubled and painful past!"
