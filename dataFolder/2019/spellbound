Text: "Who knew an unexpected and sudden plan to Turkey would make me discover the\
  \ real me after 30 years of being alive.\nIt all started when a UK based friend\
  \ of mine visited Pakistan and told us about her destination wedding taking place\
  \ in one of the most exotic destinations in Turkey. Honestly, at that point I didn't\
  \ think I'd be able to make it to the wedding, as I had travel plans to Canada.\
  \ I knew in my heart, this wedding would be so much fun. It would have been my \"\
  once in a lifetime\" opportunity to attend a destination wedding. However, I let\
  \ go of the feeling and traveled to Canada as per my plan. \nGod was kind enough\
  \ to me that I somehow got to leave Canada earlier than I had planned (for reasons\
  \ other than the wedding). As soon as I booked my ticket back to Pakistan, I booked\
  \ another ticket to Turkey from Pakistan - a decision I never regret. \nSoon as\
  \ I landed in Pakistan, I was all set to fly to Turkey, not to mention, it was my\
  \ second solo trip ever. I usually travel with my son, which I love, but solo is\
  \ different, it's liberating. \nThe first two days of my trip, I explored Istanbul\
  \ as much as I could. I took a ferry to the Asian side of Istanbul i.e. Kad\u0131\
  k\xF6y. I ate fresh fish from under the Galata Bridge, visited Blue Mosque and Hagia\
  \ Sofia, enjoyed Turkish delights with T\xFCrk kahvesi (coffee). And the next day\
  \ I flew to Dalaman, Mu\u011Fla for the grand wedding. \nThe most special part about\
  \ the wedding was that my friend was a Pakistani Muslim and the groom was an Indian\
  \ Sikh. It was the most beautifully culturally diversified wedding I could ever\
  \ attend. It was more mesmerizing than I had expected. Their customs and traditions\
  \ and ours, on one platform, just imagine the beauty! \nIn those three days, we\
  \ all ate together, drank together, celebrated together and danced together. \n\
  I still don't forget one of the comments by a Sikh guest while we were on the dance\
  \ floor, \"I didn't know you guys were as crazy as us!\" \nI didn't expect to find\
  \ the beautiful hidden connection with those who I never knew before!"
