Text: "This happened almost 10 years ago when I was about 10 years old. Me, my parents\
  \ and our friends (the 7 years old girl, her mom and dad) went to Austria to enjoy\
  \ the mountain skiing, fresh alpine air and the atmoshpere of total serenity and\
  \ harmony with the nature. Every early morning we rose up in the cable car to the\
  \ top of the slope and skied till the end of lifts work. \nThat fateful day we as\
  \ usual were going to ski however my parents occasionally got sick so that they\
  \ had no chances to spend the day basking in the alpine sun. Thus, I went skiing\
  \ under the supervision of Polina's (the 7 years old girl that I mentioned) parents.\
  \ All day the weather was perfect so it was the real plearure for us to overcome\
  \ the slopes one by one without passing the black ones. Moreover, the pastime was\
  \ so nice that we didn't notice that the last funiculars to our village were finishing\
  \ their work. By this time me and Polina were drinking hot chocolate with marshmallows\
  \ inside the one of numerous cozy mountain cafes. \nPolina's parents apparently\
  \ were not really concerned about the cable cars scheldule so when we connected\
  \ with them by the radio sets it turned out that we are in the opposite sides of\
  \ the mountain. It meant that we should go down by different lifts to reach our\
  \ village. \nWe actualy didn't catch the moment when our radio set stopped to connect\
  \ with the parens' one. We just realized that we got lost and the only cabin that\
  \ worked led not to our place. But it was the only way we had except staying overnight\
  \ on the slope. \nWe were totally frightened, hungry and exhausted. Besides, we\
  \ had no money and guesses where we went. So we knocked to the to fist door we saw\
  \ (there were not houses for about 1000 meters). It was opened by a lovely middle-aged\
  \ women who immediately invited us inside after we awkwardly explained her in English\
  \ what happened to us. \nThis night we spent by her. We called our parents who were\
  \ incredibly running high by this time however the women told them about the unsafety\
  \ of serpentine path to her village and that she was glad to host us. \nIt was unforgettable\
  \ experience for us. Although, it was thrilling and unsafe (because we could even\
  \ stay on the slope), it was also really pleasant feeling of rescue and safety and\
  \ of realizing how important to be humane."
