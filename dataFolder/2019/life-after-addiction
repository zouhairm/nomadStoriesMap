Text: "I would like to show the possibilities that recovery can offer. That you can\
  \ have a life after addiction. A new perspective on every day things that get taken\
  \ for granted by so many. Many walk through their day not appreciating the little\
  \ things. Recovery has opened me up to a whole new life. I\u2019m able to find \
  \ beauty in my surroundings like I haven\u2019t before. I now appreciate the warm\
  \ ray of the sun on my face, a cool breeze in my hair on a much deeper level.  I\
  \ practice daily gratitude and have faith in the universe that i am on the right\
  \ path. Im able to walk through my days with positivity, believing what I put out\
  \ will come back to me. Sure I have down days. Not every day is sunshine and rainbows,\
  \ but I get through those days thinking about the many great days I\u2019ve had\
  \ and will have since becoming honest with Myself. Since being able to admit I had\
  \ a problem, faced that problem and work on bettering myself daily.  We like to\
  \ say \u201Eone day at a time\u201C, and it\u2019s really true. Taking each day\
  \ like a blank page in a book your able to write on and fill.  I\u2019ve always\
  \ loved culture and travel and want to do much of it. My heart has always longed\
  \ for exploring new countries, cultures, food. I feel recovery has opened me up\
  \ to a higher appreciation. I firmly believe my future experiences will have a whole\
  \ new level of awe, gratitude, and being able to live each moment for what it really\
  \ is. Taking photos in my mind to be able to re live  when I\u2019m old, the feelings\
  \ I felt in my heart while experiencing those moments. Being able to close my eyes\
  \ and travel back in my mind."
