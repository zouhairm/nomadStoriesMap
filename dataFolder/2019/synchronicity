Text: "A dream come true. \nI've always wanted to see it with my own eyes. When I\
  \ decided to make this trip to Europe I knew it would be this time. \nA few days\
  \ ago, as soon as we arrived, for two days we had starry nights, but Aurora Borealis\
  \ was still shy. Beautiful, but shy. It visited us, but not with the power it has.\
  \ \nThen I had a dream: I saw the Aurora very strong, behind the clouds, and I woke\
  \ up knowing that when the clouds passed, we would see. Then there was the biggest\
  \ snowstorm I've ever seen. And the time was well closed! But, as everything passes,\
  \ the clouds also pass. And the starry sky appeared again.\nAnd with one of that\
  \ strange certainties, I knew that everything had its time: prepare the food, eat,\
  \ wash the dishes, take a shower, put all the pieces of clothing to leave, walk\
  \ for 5 minutes and it would be there, full. In the dark corner, in the middle of\
  \ the road we had already had those shy meetings. So it was. And there really are\
  \ no words to describe what I felt. Anyway, I'll try. SYNCHRONICITY. My eyes filled\
  \ with tears, with a huge smile. I felt like a child, I saw myself a child, I saw\
  \ myself dying and being born. That night I dreamed that I had died. And really,\
  \ I died there. But I was born again. Like every moment, I could feel it. I saw\
  \ almost no difference between the dance of lights there and the movement of everything\
  \ in the world. The only thing is that those lights our physical eyes see easier,\
  \ for being on top of the world. \nExtreme energy. And this is happening all the\
  \ time. I felt grateful, very grateful. \nTo complete these synchronicities, there\
  \ was a small group of tourists who also chose the same spot. And the guide then\
  \ took our picture with his sinister machine. The most beautiful, without us seeing.\
  \ For free. I do not have a machine. It would be all just kept inside. But I think\
  \ it was to share. So I have one beautiful photography and a history of learning\
  \ the timing inside a leap into trusting the world of magical natural lights.\n\
  Let the beauty of these dancing lights take us in full. May their strength inspire\
  \ us. And let us remember that life in this human form is just like Aurora: it appears\
  \ as a spark, vibrates, dances and disappears. But while it lasts, it is a spectacle.\
  \ \nTromso, Norway. December 2016."
