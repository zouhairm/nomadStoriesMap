Text: "Young 26 year old Linda who dreams a lot of travel but has never left the country\
  \ and has never been on a plane. I wake up to go to work, job I started 7 ago and\
  \ I\u2019m still in training. Get to work recieve a call that I won a once in a\
  \ lifetime trip to the Maldives and I right there I knew I had to choose the trip\
  \ or my job. Oh yes I chose the trip.\nFirst time on a plane viewing the beautiful\
  \ skies and my first flight was 10 hours to Dubai.\nExcited at one of the busiest\
  \ airports in the world ready to catch another flight to a beautiful destination\
  \ I only saw in pictures.\nAnother 5 hour flight and we land in Male and first thing\
  \ I feel besides my excitement is the humid heat, but once we met the resort staff\
  \ waiting for us the gave us cold towels and water to cool down.\nThen I had my\
  \ first boat ride to the private island resort called Velassaru.\nWe get there and\
  \ it was paradise, beautiful white sands and clear blue water and a big infinity\
  \ pool by the beach.\nThree hundred employees living on the island all happy and\
  \ always ready to help. \nGot to my water villa and the first thing I do is wear\
  \ my shorts and jump off the balcony for my first ever swim in the ocean.\nEverything\
  \ was so clean and elegant I never believed places like those could be real.\nFive\
  \ restaurants the serve delicious different cuisines, and I enjoyed the Japanese\
  \ cuisine restaurant dinner service the most during my stay, it was a amazing experience.\n\
  Doing water activities like jet skiing, parasailing and snorkeling was awesome.\n\
  Went on a relaxing boat cruise having delicious finger snacks, champagne and cold\
  \ Coronas chasing sunset was also great.\nAfter the cruise coming back to a beach\
  \ barbecue organized specially for us was beautiful.\nHaving conversations with\
  \ new people and finding out that the main chef an the resort manager are also South\
  \ African was eye opening that if you work hard and believe in yourself you can\
  \ also travel the world doing what you love.\nAll in all the Maldives is a beautiful\
  \ place a paradise. A place of tranquility and new experiences.\nI enjoyed my 5\
  \ day stay and I will return in future."
