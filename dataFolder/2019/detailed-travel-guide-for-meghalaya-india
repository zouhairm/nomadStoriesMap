Text: "I always wanted to visit Eastern part of my country India and finally visit\
  \ the abode of clouds: Meghalaya. I couldn\u2019t find much information online not\
  \ even in Lonely Planet\u2019s Best Escapes \u2018East & Northeast India\u2019 book.\
  \ There are two way to reach capital city Shillong. First a direct flight to Shillong\
  \ via Kolkata. Shillong city is 30kms from this airport and takes an hour.Other\
  \ is from New Delhi to Guwahati Airport.\n\nThere are cabs from Guwahati airport\
  \ to Shillong (Police bazaar area). Booking a cab for costs Rs.2000, and share cab\
  \ costs Rs.500. \n I recommend a hotel in police bazaar which is centrally located,\
  \ is in main market and you will find cabs to all major tourist destinations.\n\
  Unfortunately there is no local bus transport as such, and  few small buses (red\
  \ coloured) run through the state along with Sumos (yellow coloured). These runs\
  \ at specific times and not an ideal way to roam around the state. Cabs are highly\
  \ recommended.\n\nHave food at Trattoria for ethinic Khasi tribe cuisine at Police\
  \ bazaar. Next day I booked a cab for Rs. 2500 to see places called Elephant Falls(in\
  \ Shillong),Mawphlang and Mawsynram. Mawphlang is home to sacred Khasi forest where\
  \ they used to do sacrifices in ancient times. They have an artificial heritage\
  \ village which is worth seeing and has traditional Khasi houses. I also visited\
  \ hot springs in Mawsynram. From Shillong to Mawphlang and Mawsynram and back to\
  \ Shillong is a 7-8 hours journey.\n\nYou can do the Shillong City tour and Umiam\
  \ Lake for around Rs. 1500. You should visit Don Bosco Museum which showcases rich\
  \ NE India culture, Don Bosco Church and Shillong Peak *(recommend visiting early\
  \ morning). Please carry your id cards for Shillong peak as it\u2019s under area\
  \ belonging to armed forces. Umiam lake is very beautiful and they have Jet Ski\
  \ to ride at Rs. 400.\n\nThere is a Meghalaya tourism center in Police bazaar near\
  \ the bus stand. You can book a Government bus at Rs. 350 for Cherrapunji tour.\
  \ It will take you to places Mawkdok Valley Viewpoint, Eco Park, Mawsmai Caves,\
  \ Mottrop Rock, Thankkharang Park,Ramakrishna Mission Museum, Nohkalikai Falls and\
  \ Seven Sister falls. This bus tour will save you some money as local site seeing\
  \ will cost around Rs.2000 unless you are travelling as group. \n\nTrek to \u2018\
  Living Root Bridges\u2019 is one the main attractions in Meghalaya . The major bridges\
  \ are based in Nongriat village which is 13 kms from Cherrapunji. Book a cab for\
  \ a day at Rs. 800. Local transport is not available.\n\nThis trek will take 6-7\
  \ hours of your time. There are lots of ups and downs in the trek as it\u2019s an\
  \ area based at bottom of a hill. It will take around 2 hours to reach the famous\
  \ double decker bridge. \n\n There are  home stays near the double decker bridge\
  \ if you can\u2019t walk much would suggest stay for the night there. It will cost\
  \ around Rs. 500-1000.\n\nNext stop Mawlynnong which is around 81 kms from Cherrapunji\
  \ and requires almost 3 hours to reach. Known for being one of cleanest villages\
  \ in Asia. You need to book a cab as there is no direct public transport available.\
  \ Cab will cost around Rs. 2500. There are lots of homestays having rooms ranging\
  \ from Rs. 500 to Rs.1500.\n\nOn Sundays because of Church prayers private cabs\
  \ are not available. Only one sharing Sumo which goes as early as 6:30 AM from Mawlynnong\
  \ (except Sunday). I changed my plan a little and booked a private cab at RS. 1000\
  \ for Dawki and Tamabil which are near India-Bangladesh border. Dawki is 35 kms\
  \ from Mawlynnong and will take around 1:30 hours to reach.\n\nDid boating in Dawki\
  \ river (at Rs. 500) and can see bottom of river at certain places. Tamabil is near\
  \ Dawki and is the last town before entering Bangladesh. If you have passports and\
  \ plan to travel further check for necessary clearances as Dhaka is 6 hours journey\
  \ from here. With BSF permission which they easily give, you can walk upto Bangladesh\
  \ post.\nYou can head back to Shillong as there are lost of shared Sumo\u2019s which\
  \ run from these places to capital at Rs. 150-250."
