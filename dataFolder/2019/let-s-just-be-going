Text: "\u201CLet\u2019s just be going (leh jeh be gwen),\u201D a Liberian slang for,\
  \ \u201Cmoving right along,\u201D \u201Ccarry on,\u201D or, in this case, \u201C\
  we\u2019re best friends from now on.\u201D\nOne hour to sunset on Christmas Day\
  \ last year, after driving along the Golden Circle rout in Iceland and experiencing\
  \ Geysir, the famous geyser, and Gullfoss, a two-tiered, 105\u2019 waterfall, four\
  \ of us park at the bottom of the hill in the Reykjadalur Valley. My final birthday\
  \ wish\u2014 and last thing to do before I leave tomorrow\u2014 soak in the hot\
  \ spring river. A 2.3 kilometer hike into the hills means that we\u2019ll soak,\
  \ but return to the parking lot in the dark. After much deliberation we decide to\
  \ carry on with our plan to this destination not popularly advertised to travelers.\
  \ The path to the river wraps and winds along the mountain side, each turn revealing\
  \ breathtaking valleys, waterfalls and steam filled landscapes. \u201CReykja\u201D\
  \ means smoke (steam from the earth), as in what the supposed original founder of\
  \ Iceland saw when he first landed near Reykjav\xEDk (smoky harbor/ bay). As we\
  \ draw closer, sulfur smells fill the air accompanied by the sounds of boiling water\
  \ gushing from the earth. A few locals greet us with \u201CMerry Christmas\u201D\
  \ wishes as we undress and relax in this natural wonder. I\u2019m used  to hot springs\
  \ next to flowing rivers, not a whole river of hot water to wade in! The water temperature\
  \ is perfect; about 105\xB0 fahrenheit. The mountain air is a bit cold, but all\
  \  one has to do is immerse oneself in the flowing water. The mixed temperature\
  \ feels good, actually. \n\u201CAh, guys, remember this moment,\u201D Morgan says,\
  \ as she beckons Jonah, Juan and me to sit in a circle and hold hands. \u201CWhen\
  \ life gets tough back in America, remember we\u2019re here, sitting in a hot spring\
  \ river in the mountains of Iceland.\u201D\nBut Mother Nature herself has an immediate\
  \ test for us to see how grateful we truly are. We\u2019ve been pampered so far\
  \ in Iceland.  A light drizzle warns us that some rain is coming, and we dress and\
  \ head down to the parking lot. On the way comes the rain along with high gusts\
  \ of winds strong enough to slide me a few feet off the track. Tiny little Morgan\
  \ too, is struggling to walk, so I grab her hand; she grabs Jobah\u2019s hands,\
  \ and Jonah grabs on to Juan. We form a human chain and humbly walk in a 90\xB0\
  \ angle as slowly and carefully as we can. It\u2019s a valley; hill on one side,\
  \ and a few hundred feet drop on the other. Everything on our bodies is wet; we\u2019\
  re freezing, and get a final gust as we turn the last corner before descending to\
  \ the parking lot. This final force of wind throws the four of us against the mountainside\u2014\
  \ luckily. We crawl our way through this area and then, to our surprise, the wind\
  \ stops. At bottom of the hill we all catch our breaths and give each other hugs\
  \ as long as time. I thought I was going to die at one point; what a way it would\
  \ have been to go. Dying on my birthday. But we had each other to care for; to make\
  \ sure we all got down to the parking lot. \u201CLet it be known, Jonah says, that\
  \ no matter what, I trust the three of you with my life. We\u2019re friends for\
  \ life now.\u201D We all felt the same way. Just two days before we were strangers\
  \ in the lounge area of our hostel, saying hello to each other and recognizing the\
  \ American accent. This evening, we carried each other and escaped death by wind.\
  \ Later we sit in an Icelandic bar bonding over beers, happy to be alive and in\
  \ the company of trusted friends. We\u2019ve planned road future road trips, birthday\
  \ parties, and hikes yet to come. We\u2019d even go back to that river for another\
  \ soak. Until then, let\u2019s just be going."
