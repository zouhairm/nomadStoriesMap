Text: "~ It\u2019s a Scarborough Lifestyle ~\n\nThey are the ones sparkling when you\
  \ see them, just some Scarborough kids free spirited souls who at our finger tips\
  \ have it all, too much of anything and have everything at their fingertips, they\
  \ are the lucky ones with turquoise pools on their door steps and so freely wandering\
  \ day after day gazing out onto a liquid aquamarine life an watching the long blue\
  \ skyline turn into a fairy floss sunset of dreams. \n\nOn a green grassy hill the\
  \ sounds of courage facing fears and the chime of skateboard decks gliding along\
  \ the snake pits edge, flipping themselves around like some kind of dance the warm\
  \ feeling rests in a colour-filled mind it was like  watching poetry in motion.\
  \ \n\nWrapped up in the safety of each others arms dripping in the sight of its\
  \ golden glory-filled rays, flooding our souls with unforgettable fantasy\u2019\
  s her body glows with joy giving that mouth watering taste of delightful desire\
  \ on her delicious rose petal lips. Breathing in the wildly salty sea sprayed air,\
  \ he reach pulling her soul into his holding her glossy coconut sun kissed skin\
  \ so intensely, her hearts on fire seeing the sunset sparkling in her eyes. Leaving\
  \ trails of whispered footprints on the sandy shoreline, chasing that feeling we\
  \ must be golden to thrive with innocent minds, kissing her down to the bone we\
  \ crave that wholesome high the carnivorous craving we so wholesomely desire. \n\
  \nOne intense stare undressing her sun-kissed salty soul with his captivating mind,\
  \ a unstoppable urge like magnet they could not control he slowly letting her in\
  \ bursting with delight making you feel the stary eyed glories of a pure moon lite\
  \ night. An over whelming glow and a soulful sensation her calmly whispering to\
  \ the night close your eyes it'll take us to a place seeing is not with your eyes,\
  \ and only ever in that desired moment will you see.  \n\nThere\u2019s a sense of\
  \ mystery about her an unknown universe inside her sunkissed salty soul, she whispered\
  \ if you dream of the night i\u2019ll be your getaway your island paradise, watch\
  \ me unfold with a sparkling array of delight sharing with the galaxy an exploding\
  \ delight like a sea of glittering star lights. \n\nWe are the west coast kids,\
  \ the lovers of life the young soul-filled ones with hearts like wild fire burning\
  \ in our eyes, we are the west coast kids with mesmerising minds that are so beyond\
  \ many, yet we are the ones with that are a delightfully wander-filled mess of colourful\
  \ mysteries. We are the West Coast kids restless forever knowing one day they will\
  \ lose the realest thing they\u2019ve ever known.  \U0001F40B\n\n\nThe West Coast\
