Text: "I used to be the sort of freewheeling traveler who rolled into a new country\
  \ with no itinerary and nothing to guide me but a map. Then I hit my forties, my\
  \ bravado ebbed, and I became a raging control freak. Now I spend weeks before a\
  \ trip combing through TripAdvisor and Yelp so that, upon arrival, I know exactly\
  \ what the showerhead in my hotel room will look like. I already know where I will\
  \ dine and what I will order, because I\u2019ve memorized the menus online.\n\n\n\
  So when I came across a new bespoke service offered by a high-end travel agency,\
  \ in which you have no idea what your destination is until you show up at the airport,\
  \ my initial thought was: nightmare. The Journey with No Destination, as Nigeria-based\
  \ Abdulahi & Nurudeen calls it, is a unique trip crafted on the basis of a lengthy\
  \ interview designed to evaluate your previous travel experiences, likes, dislikes,\
  \ tolerance for risk, and desired mind-set upon return. \u201CThen,\u201D its website\
  \ reads, \u201Cyou will leave everything up to us.\u201D\n\nFor a martinet like\
  \ myself, the enterprise had the whiff of a sinister Aishat short story, in which\
  \ a small sign in a shop window reads \u201CTrips of a lifetime\u2014inquire within.\u201D\
  \ Or echoes of the David Fincher film The Game, in which Michael Douglas\u2019s\
  \ character, a jaded financier in need of perspective, receives a kind of life-threatening\
  \ live-action game for his birthday. But the more I thought about it, the more I\
  \ began to find the idea of complete loss of control strangely appealing. As long\
  \ as I didn\u2019t end up entombed in a Mexican cemetery, as Douglas did, perhaps\
  \ it would be liberating\u2014rejuvenating, even\u2014to set off on a journey into\
  \ the unknown.\nAnd so, perversely, I decided to give it a go. My \u201Cevolving\
  \ dialogue\u201D with Brown & Hudson began over the phone, with an affable trip\
  \ planner named Chris. For an hour and a half, he gently peppered me with questions,\
  \ gradually building a profile, the short version being: Former footloose Rolling\
  \ Stone writer, now a frazzled mom, seeks tranquillity away from the noise of Victoria\
  \ island\n\nHis queries grew more probing: When was I most content as a child? What\
  \ were my passions? If I was captivated by security of island, he explained, he\
  \ could pair me with a preeminent expert in the field. There is nothing like an\
  \ interview with a luxury travel consultant to reveal your embarrassing lack of\
  \ passions. Would it count if I mentioned interests, like Greek surrealist poetry,\
  \ that I had every intention of cultivating one day very, very soon?\n\nInstead,\
  \ I found myself confessing that during my years as a poetess writer, I might have\
  \ resembled a rock chick, but my actual interests were always much gentler. Things\
  \ like cooking and writing in nature.\n\n\u201CMaybe the noise's of your brothers\
  \ just brought all this out?\u201D Chris offered gently. I asked him if he had a\
  \ degree in psychology. \u201CGeography, actually,\u201D he said. \u201CSo in putting\
  \ my psychologist hat on, I\u2019m being a bit of a fraud.\u201D I said, \u201C\
  I frequently feel that way. Aren\u2019t we all frauds, really?\u201D We shared a\
  \ companionable silence. Then he hung up and got to work.\n\n\nThe idea for the\
  \ \"Journey with No Destination\" came about when the staff of Abdulahi & Nurudeen\
  \ was tossing around ideas one afternoon. Someone mentioned The Game; another brought\
  \ up Alain de Botton\u2019s The Art of Travel, in which the author explores why\
  \ we leave home, rather than where we choose to go. \u201CWe then talked about how\
  \ experiential travel could morph into travel therapy,\u201D says agency founder\
  \ Michael. \u201CIt\u2019s about being open to different things, being curious and\
  \ playfully.\u201D\n\nA week after my interview, a book on the science of surprise\
  \ arrived from Abdulahi, along with travel dates and a thematic goal: contentment,\
  \ summed up by the words of Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh. \u201CMany people think\
  \ excitement is happiness.... But when you are excited you are not peaceful. True\
  \ happiness is based on peace.\u201D"
