Text: "Underwater and inside a mossy cloud that I created with my clumsy movements,\
  \ that thing that I didn\u2019t believed appeared. The thing that a fisherman swore\
  \ I could find in his backyard river and I, skeptical, thought that if it truly\
  \ was there, I would\u2019t be as great as he presented it. \nIt really appeared,\
  \ much more glorious than his words. This encounter is the exception of the rule\
  \ that I stablished after months of working with them: \u201CNever believe everything\
  \ a fisherman says\u201D. \n\nLast summer I went for a couple of months to a little\
  \ town in the south of Chile. It\u2019s not Patagonia, it\u2019s the forgotten middle\
  \ south coast of Chile. That coast that even Chileans skip in order to get to Patagonia\
  \ quicker, but in my eyes is as beautiful, and a shame that so many are missing\
  \ it.\nI was working with the syndicates of fishermen, how to get organized, the\
  \ paperwork they needed to do to get benefits they deserved and using the contacts\
  \ I was making to get interviews with fisherman to get information about the subaquatic\
  \ world, just for my personal interest. \n\nI did dozens of interviews, to people\
  \ that collected seaweed at the coasts, shellfish catchers, woman, man, kids, everyone\
  \ was invited to tell me what they loved about their sea. Where to dive, where not\
  \ to dive in my free time.\nThey laughed at me because I wanted to dive just for\
  \ placer, because they thought I was very brave to go there on my own been a young\
  \ woman, they laugh at me for many reasons but mostly because I founded beautiful\
  \ the things they didn\u2019t even saw anymore.\nTo me, everything was to get dazzled\
  \ by. The ancient forest of relict trees, the curvy hills and the narrow street\
  \ that got wet every time the waves came in.\nAnd I left them laugh. As long as\
  \ they told me their stories, they could laugh all they wanted.  They told me about\
  \ their dead\u2019s and how they paid their respects traditionally in the water.\
  \ We talk about the sinking ships and the fishes.\nOne morning I was hick hiking\
  \ on my way to the office when a white wrecked pickup truck stopped. It was Jorge,\
  \ a not so old, -but less young- fisherman that didn\u2019t care so much about me.\n\
  \nThis time he treated me great, and I will be forever grateful. He wanted to show\
  \ me something that was on the river of his backyard. I said ok and I saw my office\
  \ get lost on the broken mirror of the car.\n\nAbout a mile up by the Contaco river\
  \ we parked on a swamp. I got down the car and he handed me a diving suit. With\
  \ his southern difficult accent, he told me to dive by the plastique bottle that\
  \ was floating. Down there was \u201Cthe whale\u201D. I thought, disappointed: \u201C\
  are you kidding me? A whale on a river\u2026\u201D     \nThe first dive just felt\
  \ cold and dark. The second one was it. I got to the end of the rope that had the\
  \ bottle on top. I felt something hard and rough, and with my moves I lifted a cloud\
  \ of moss that didn\u2019t let me see anything. But, when the moss got away I saw\
  \ that the thing was white and giant. \n\nEvery move I made lifted that annoying\
  \ cloud, but also discovered the bone. A whale\u2019s vertebra. Imagine how I felt\
  \ when I realized that there where another rough thing in front of the first one.\
  \ And another, and nine more. And after a space of the same size of the other vertebras,\
  \ another five. \n\nThat was my last -not so productive- day on the office. When\
  \ I got back I started what it felt like my meant to be journey on that place: find\
  \ out how the whale got to the river, find the missing vertebra of the whale, find\
  \ out how to communicate the filling of diving a whale\u2019s skeleton on a lost\
  \ river.  \n\nI found the vertebra and how it got there, that\u2019s another story.\
  \ But my journey is not finished until I tell people about it."
