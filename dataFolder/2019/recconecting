Text: "I\u2019d met my grandma again in Italy, after 8 years of her death. I went\
  \ downstairs and she was in the kitchen, her favorite place. It was Christmas and\
  \ I\u2019d traveled to Ascoli Piceno to spend the holidays with my family\u2019\
  s Italian friend. My grandma was also half Italian and maybe, that's why she managed\
  \ to visit me there. Since she died, Christmas had lost all the sense, because she\
  \ was the center of everything.\n\nThe first thing that I noticed when I arrived\
  \ in Ascoli was the way that they talk. Loud. Happy. Quick. Passionate. After the\
  \ city tour, when we get back home, the most delicious pasta was there waiting for\
  \ me. I remember sitting with my friend's family and I could talk with a true mama\
  \ italiana. The smell, the taste, the feeling still remains in my memory, like a\
  \ tattoo. \n\nOn Christmas Eve, we drove until his relative's house to celebrate.\
  \ His cousins, aunts, uncles, and parents trying to speak in English with me and\
  \ I was trying to communicate with my nonexisting Italian with them. somehow, we\
  \ managed to understand each other. But I didn't realize that something special\
  \ was about to happen.\n\nThe morning after, his dad invited me to go to the mountains\
  \ for me to see the snow. It was the first time that I was seeing snow in my life.\
  \ When I less expected, a snowball was coming towards me and that movie scene started,\
  \ with a lot of fun. I had my so much wanted white Christmas after all.\n\nWe came\
  \ back to their house and when I went downstairs, I saw her, at the table. I'm pretty\
  \ sure that she was expecting for me. She was in a form of a recipe's book. As I\
  \ told before, her favorite place was the kitchen. I remember her sitting at her\
  \ chair, speaking a lot. Speaking like the Italians: Loud. Happy. Quick. Passionate.\
  \ She was also the greatest cook I'd ever met in my life. Her recipes are still\
  \ in my memory, like that pasta that I ate when I arrived. As she was the center\
  \ of our attention, all Christmas Eve was in her house and if you were there, she\
  \ would make you feel like the best and most important person in the universe. Do\
  \ you remember that feeling in the Christmas morning, when everything it's fun and\
  \ you want to play with your new toy and discover new adventures with? In her presence,\
  \ all moments were like this.\n\nThat recipe's book had handwriting just like hers.\
  \ And also the way that she used to cut the recipes from the boxes and paste in\
  \ those pages. This notebook was like a trigger to my mind, that I learned with\
  \ this trip, that doesn't matter where you are, those who you love will always be\
  \ with you. \n\nI closed that notebook, with tears in my eyes and a smile on my\
  \ face, glad that I could met my grandma. Christmas was live again."
