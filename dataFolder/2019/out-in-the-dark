Text: "Out in the dark\nby Zanda Tere\u0161ko\n\nBright full moon are rolling over\
  \ Dobeles vast woods and I am heading to Pokaini forest. Alone. With sleeping bag,\
  \ matches, knife and torch. It\u2019s near midnight and lonely car pass by, then\
  \ stops and returs to me.\n- Where are you going? - driver asks.\nWhat are my options?\
  \ I can assume that driver are serial killer and continue my way in proud, safe\
  \ \nloneliness? I've gone 3 kilometres, another 11 kilometres left. three more hours\
  \ on footh. \u2013 To Pokaini.\n- Get in.\nYes, he is local, yes, he knows about\
  \ forest, but not much. It\u2019s just trees and rocks and different kind of strange\
  \ people in celebration of solar solstices.\nHe drives me to the forest and leaves\
  \ in the dark.\n\nPokaini forest is one of many Latvia X-files \u2013 stone rivers\
  \ and piles ramparts  have produced fantastic stories and conflicting assumptions.\
  \ Forest is also considered an ancient sacred place and has become a known tourism\
  \ facility since the mid-1990 s. Why thousands of people go to Pokaini every year?\
  \ Locals guide says  \u2013 it\u2019s curiosity. People are coming and hope to improve\
  \ their lives, health and relationships.\n\nPokaini forest is quiet and calm. I\
  \ light my torch (also spill firing liquid all over my arms) and go into the woods.\
  \ There is star-shaped mushrooms, blow-up cuddlies, mossy trees, tricky and slippery\
  \ roots and none of full moon people I hoped to meet and talk. I wandered through\
  \ the dark forest.\nIt starts to rain and I am lost. I have photographed map, but\
  \ forest trails looks same. I climb a hill and descend into the valley. I circle\
  \ around and found wood pyramid. This will be my shelter that night.\nI rounded\
  \ up cigarette and smoke. I left torch lit. I wrap into my sleeping bag and nestle\
  \ down. Dry at least, humble though pops up and vanish in softness of sleep.\n\n\
  Wierd noise woke me up. Torch  had burned out. Literally. Branches breaks in distance.\
  \ Silent growling. Cooing. Heavy breathing. \n\nMy eyes is wide open looking into\
  \ dark. Whats that noise? Is that footsteps? Is that human? That driver come back?\
  \ And from nowhere my mind is full with sharp teeth and nails. I\u2019m waiting\
  \ for dark shadow showing in entrance of my shelter. I feel spoky and wet forest,\
  \ who have his own order and past. Shamans and witches. And their hunters - men\
  \ with dogs breaking through the thicket.\nI closed my eyes and calm my hearth.\
  \ I hope that sun is near. \nWhen we are alone in night our imagination is not only\
  \ imagination Everything that outside are real. It's process of long lost idea about\
  \ initiation. Women are initiated by nature. But  men. They went outside, they spend\
  \ night, or week, or month alone in dark, harsh wild. Into woods, caves and thickets\
  \ they walked their souls darkest trails and gaze into abyss. \n\nIn the first light\
  \ of morning I go and look around. I found wounded threes, barks cut down from trees.\
  \ Deer came in night and peel their horns. Or forest pig sharpened their tusks.\
  \ \nSmoky mist ramble through forest. Old stories talks about stone pyramid sunk\
  \ in swamp. Soviet geologists in 1970 found here strange  radiance from underground.\
  \ Lots of photographs taken in Pokaini has deformation \u2013 white flying bubbles,\
  \ strange color bar. There is place where cannot take pictures. What and why - true\
  \ about this place is long gone with old palaeolithic people, who live and pray\
  \ wild godds here. \nBut still pilgrims leaves their gift to different stones. Mother\
  \ stone, father stone. Bride stone is most gifted, visitors left their pray and\
  \ sacrifice - flowers, bread, acorns and cones.  \n\nOn my way out of forest I sit\
  \ down in boat of stones and disturb two toads. It just part of nature, small and\
  \ unharmed one. \n\t\nMaybe I wanted to be frightened.  Humble need in this age\
  \ of electricity, bills, hot showers and drowsy TV series. Maybe I wanted to see\
  \ what is there \u2013 outside in dark, but instead I found and founded something\
  \ dark inside.\n\nI went home. \nNext time I had my bicycle with me."
