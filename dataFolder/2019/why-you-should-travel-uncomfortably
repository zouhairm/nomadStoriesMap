Text: "When one\u2019s idea of \u201Ccamping\u201D means staying in a hotel that doesn\u2019\
  t provide a hair dryer, trekking into the Amazon with nothing more than a backpack\
  \ may seem like an unusual trip to choose. But sometimes pushing the boundaries\
  \ of comfort brings the greatest reward.\n\nI allowed myself a few adjustment days\
  \ in Iquitos, Peru before heading to the rustic, spiritual retreat located deep\
  \ in the jungle. Staying at a neighborhood home-stay with no air conditioning or\
  \ hot water seemed like a good transition \u2013 fewer comforts than home but definitely\
  \ not camping. The trip to the retreat in the mid-August heat would be difficult\
  \ so even small luxuries were welcome.\n\nMy home-stay host and his friends counseled\
  \ me about the Amazon, kept me company, answered my questions, and gave me tours\
  \ of the city. We ate food from a restaurant built into the front of a neighbor\u2019\
  s home and listened to music coming from everywhere around us. I\u2019ve rarely\
  \ experienced such open kindness from complete strangers. \n\nOn the last day before\
  \ the trek, my new Peruvian friend Nancy and I ran arm-in-arm, laughing, along the\
  \ Iquitos promenade, seeking patches of shade to avoid the blistering sun. She insisted\
  \ that I see the panoramic view of the Amazon jungle. Under a gigantic, cloudless,\
  \ deep-blue sky, an endless expanse of green threatens to engulf the city whole.\
  \ And, as if to warn us of its intent, a cruise ship grounded just off the promenade,\
  \ covered in a deep tangle of vines, is being reclaimed by the jungle. I learned\
  \ that it\u2019s not unusual to lose things, including people, to the Amazon.\n\n\
  The next morning my fellow seekers and I boarded a long, wooden boat with a low,\
  \ cloth \u201Croof\u201D that kept us from baking alive. Our journey was slow and\
  \ uneventful, eventually coming ashore at a small village of neat, stucco houses\
  \ with tin roofs where our surroundings changed from lush green to beige. The land\
  \ around the village was completely clear of trees or grass \u2013 which seemed\
  \ odd after hours of seeing only jungle \u2013 and, in the center of what could\
  \ only be described as the town square, was a satellite tower. It was a bittersweet\
  \ thing to see this technology in a place that otherwise seemed so untouched by\
  \ the west. We slung on our backpacks and began the hour-long walk in the sun.\n\
  \nBecause of recent rains, the dirt road was washed out in many places, making our\
  \ trek slow and slightly treacherous. More than one expletive was hurled as a foot\
  \ went into a muddy pool or an ankle came close to twisting. Along the way, we strangers\
  \ began to get to know one another. I now believe that this hike is intended to\
  \ help groups bond before reaching the center. When we finally saw the entrance\
  \ sign, we were relieved and excited to be arriving as friends. \n\nThe retreat\
  \ is a village of sorts, made of traditional, open-air wooden buildings with intricately\
  \ thatched palm-leaf roofs. After orientation, we were led through the retreat to\
  \ our tambos where we slept. Mine was outfitted with a mosquito-netted bed, a hammock,\
  \ and a hand-hewn, rustic bench and table. There was a clothes line in the room\
  \ as well as nails to hang things from. And a \"toilet\". The commode had no seat\
  \ and, tucked beside it, there was a five gallon bucket of water. Don\u2019t ask\
  \ me how, but I knew how it worked and, for the first time since arriving in Peru,\
  \ my spirit of adventure didn\u2019t outweigh my discomfort. Of course, when you\u2019\
  re that far from civilization, there\u2019s not much you can do but suck it up.\n\
  \nThe jungle around us teamed with life, from the most colorful birds you can imagine\
  \ to herds of chattering monkeys in the trees. As I sat on my tambo\u2019s stoop\
  \ writing in my journal with the dappled sun warming my skin, a tiny owl landed\
  \ on the ground in front of me and stared deep into my eyes. And, in that moment,\
  \ I forgot about the \u201Ctoilet\u201D and the other small discomforts and realized\
  \ that I could live without a hair dryer \u2013 at least for a week."
