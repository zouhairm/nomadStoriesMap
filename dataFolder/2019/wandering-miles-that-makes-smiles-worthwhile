Text: "For someone who has lived outside of his home country for the least six years\
  \ [not that it\u2019s a pulchritudinous feat as others may have stayed elsewhere\
  \ for a decade or so], there\u2019s always that pursuit to find a place that you\
  \ will eventually call your second home. Nonetheless, seeking for that specific\
  \ place to which you will consider as your own comfort zone where you build your\
  \ niche from the goals you\u2019ve set prior to moving overseas. I guess, this is\
  \ \u201Ca very Southeast Asian\u201D culture. I\u2019m not generalizing but coming\
  \ from a land where overseas contract workers are touted as present day heroes,\
  \ my kin are in constant search of the best place to raise our flags and make things\
  \ in favor for ourselves, families and national economy.\n\nWhile most of us choose\
  \ to try our luck in Singapore, the Middle East, Scandinavia or the Americas, I\
  \ decided to start my journey in Thailand. My friends asked: \u201CWhy Thailand?\u201D\
  , I dare say: \u201CWhy not?\u201D. Thailand, home to 69 million people and flocked\
  \ by 32.58 million tourists across the earth according to the World Tourism Organization,\
  \ is a country to which has never been colonized by the explorers of Europe got\
  \ me thinking that aside from my adoration of the exquisite and flabbergasting nam\
  \ un-chan, sai ua and khao soi, could feasibly be the equitable place that I am\
  \ supposed to be. And so, with a duffle bag, I packed in a 7-pair wardrobe just\
  \ to kick-off a traveling lifestyle that I have always, always wanted to do. The\
  \ downside though is unlike most Westerners that I\u2019ve known, I fell short of\
  \ the much needed budget to sustain a way of life as such. With that, I ventured\
  \ into teaching which is the most reliable and convenient way to secure yourself\
  \ a job in Thailand.\n\nIn Thailand, I was able to test my patience, as usually,\
  \ the students\u2019 take on in learning phasa Angkrit is not as intense as learning\
  \ Arts, Math or even Sports. In return, I learned their language. Though I can\u2019\
  t read or write, I guess my Thai communication skills is good enough to bargain\
  \ in shopping, order food with special instructions or simply know when I\u2019\
  m the one being talked about (don\u2019t get offended though, as in Thai culture\
  \ what you think is rumor mongering is considered as normal and common as Thai people\
  \ are not confrontational because they\u2019re gentle in nature).\n\nThailand has\
  \ opened numerous opportunities for me that is something I have to be very grateful\
  \ for a lifetime. It has been magnanimous to me and no matter how many times I tried\
  \ to leave it in search for that greener pasture, Thailand has welcomed me with\
  \ warm hugs and open arms. Thailand has provided me career platforms in education\
  \ and latter in marketing that sharpened my professional experience instilling in\
  \ me international understanding and global competitiveness. Most importantly, it\
  \ served as my springboard in reconnoitering its wonderful neighbors. In 6 years,\
  \ despite of several private restrictions, I was able to visit places within the\
  \ ASEAN region. Thanks to visa runs, business trips and soul searching, I was able\
  \ to tick off 15 countries of my list. \n\nThus, with a rational recollection of\
  \ distinctive involvements, what I revere as a pertinent leap into the unknown has\
  \ become a transformational phase in my life. The connections I have formed, discoveries\
  \ that I have found has made the whole decision to live abroad worth it of every\
  \ tribulation and countless homesickness that Thailand became so familiar, I now\
  \ blend in to its community so well. It doesn\u2019t require science and technology\
  \ to adapt culture. What\u2019s essential is a defying disposition. \n\nYet, moving\
  \ forward to the frontiers of the future, there will always be some other place\
  \ that might attract you and make you recalibrate your aspirations for what you\
  \ think you deserve better. But until that moment comes, I couldn\u2019t complain\
  \ more of eating som tam kai kem mai phet while basked under the sun at the famous\
  \ canal-side eateries spread out within the cosmopolitan city of Krung Thep and\
  \ waiting for the thirst-quenching cha nom yen that indeed completes a day of sabai\
  \ sabai."
