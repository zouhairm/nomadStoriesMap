Text: "What is the secret of youthful looks? I shamelessly stare at him and can't\
  \ help wondering... Good food? Exercise? Slow pace of life?  He gracefully passes\
  \ by me and I wave at him, smiling like a teenager who has just run into her crush.\
  \ He stops for a second, chewing with him mouth wide open but I don't care. Hey,\
  \ if you make it to your 200-th birthday and you can chew, you can chew anyway you\
  \ like from my perspective. \n\nA Galapagos Giant Tortoise, estimated age: 200 years.\
  \ A guide points at the shell and says: \u201CCan you see those marks?\u201D I look\
  \ closer and indeed notice strange scar-alike marks on the shell of my crush. Is\
  \ he a hero? Did he survive a battle with a predator? Wait, there are no predators\
  \ on Galapagos islands. What are these marks then? \u201CThe settlers wanted to\
  \ check how thick the shells were: So, they shoot them.\u201D The words of the guide\
  \ pierce my heart and I have no shell to protect it. What a horrible thing to do.\
  \ \n\nI look around and try to imagine how Galapagos Islands looked before they\
  \ were declared a park. Back then, settlers didn't think about the locals, they\
  \ couldn't care less about turtles or birds. They hunted them without thinking of\
  \ the future and caused extensive damage to the gentle souls of Galapagos. The population\
  \ of turtles declined from 250,000 in the 16-th century to 3,000 in 1970-s. Luckily,\
  \ the government of Ecuador decided to act before it was too late and turned the\
  \ islands into a park. \n\nThese days, Galapagos is a paradise for turtles, giant\
  \ tortoises, seals, lizards, iguanas, sally crabs and the rest of the wild marine\
  \ gang. Only the scars on shells of gentle giants remind us of the dark past of\
  \ Galapagos. I look again at my 200-year-old friend, this time with admiration and\
  \ respect. He holds no grudge, he is not bitter or hateful; it seems like he managed\
  \ to forgive silly humans for their mistakes and moved on, slowly, very, very slowly.\
  \ \nThat's it! I want to be like this Giant Turtle: from now and on, I am going\
  \ to eat healthy and forgive those who sometimes try to see how thick my shell is.\
  \ And I am going to slow down and study my surroundings better. Thank you for the\
  \ inspiration, Mr. Giant Turtle! See you soon! I take one last picture and slowly\
  \ walk away. I turn around to see if maybe, he is looking. He is not, being busy\
  \ with chewing grass. Oh well, a girl can only hope."
