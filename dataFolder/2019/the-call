Text: "I could feel it.\n It was like the city was wrapping its cold and cloudy arms\
  \ around me, begging me to stay, begging me to understand its streets and traces.\
  \ And even though I wanted to say no to that invitation, I couldn\u2019t deny its\
  \ request. I knew I didn\u2019t have time. I didn\u2019t want to create a bond I\
  \ would miss afterward. At that moment, the busy surroundings and dozens of people\
  \ walking around the street reminded me of home, and at the same time, I felt distant\
  \ from the place I thought I belonged to. \nThe rain hit my skin as if it was warning\
  \ me to wake up, or else I would be stuck on that daydream forever. But I couldn\u2019\
  t. I simply couldn\u2019t keep myself from immersing into that world. I couldn\u2019\
  t keep my heart from being wrapped by that grey landscape\u2019s gigantic, scary\
  \ and somehow lovely hands. When I noticed what was happening, it was already too\
  \ late. London had caught me, and carved its nails on my skin, in all of my insignificant\
  \ organs. It was pulling me closer, forcing me to create a connection between my\
  \ soul and its alleys, corners, and sidewalks. \nI had only been there for a few\
  \ days. Maybe two or three. But I was already stuck on it forever. Everywhere I\
  \ went, I could hear the air calling me, the people asking me not to wake up, the\
  \ streets begging for me to walk around, saying \u201CWelcome\u201D. And I could\
  \ only thank that place for such hospitality, for creating a connection without\
  \ my permission. With people, this doesn\u2019t happen. You can\u2019t force anyone\
  \ to love you; you can\u2019t tell them they belong to you. Human connections are\
  \ something you can control. Now, a literally local connection ain't something you\
  \ choose to have. Places do not obey your orders and desperate requests; they act\
  \ as they want to. \nThe world and its places have a unique life. Stone, rain, concrete,\
  \ rivers, windows and traffic lights breathe on their own. And they choose whoever\
  \ they want to call. \nThat city caught me in ways I could never imagine, and I\
  \ didn't care. I wanted to go back the second I left because our bond was sustained\
  \ by a rope that is wrapped around my whole body. \nAnd the one scene I watch over\
  \ and over in my mind is the last the taxi I saw in that city. Its words were quite\
  \ simple. \"London is calling\"."
