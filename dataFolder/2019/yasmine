Text: "Breastfeeding is already a sweaty ordeal. I sat dripping from the pits, from\
  \ behind the knees, torrents from beneath my breasts soaking poor Shepherd\u2019\
  s face as he tried to replenish his own depleting liquids. The stench of his recent\
  \ diaper change still hung heavy in the Home Office waiting room, and my fellow\
  \ waiters still simmered with quiet repulsion. Shepherd was born three weeks prior,\
  \ during my postdoc in Cape Town, where we sat waiting to obtain his official birth\
  \ certificate. Officially, babies born in South Africa should obtain their birth\
  \ certificates one month after birth, with both parents and baby present. There\
  \ were no appointments, but by the looks of the other kids and parents in line,\
  \ some had been waiting for years. Children born to local South Africans could get\
  \ birth certificates at the hospital, so we waited together with about a hundred\
  \ other immigrants.\n\nMore than once, a nearby stranger handed me her baby and\
  \ left to use the toilet or go down the street to buy lunch. More than once, a nearby\
  \ stranger grabbed Shepherd and gave me a parenting lesson. Most of our neighbours\
  \ spoke little English, but no words were necessary to demonstrate the proper way\
  \ of rocking a baby to sleep or cooing softly in his ear to calm him. My way was\
  \ not the proper way. More than once, my husband got a look of horrifying disapproval\
  \ as he strapped Shepherd to his chest and bounced him to sleep. We spent an entire\
  \ day in that steamy waiting room, slick with sweat and alien intrigue.\n\n\u2018\
  How old is your baba?\u2019 they\u2019d ask. \n\u2018Three weeks,\u2019 I\u2019\
  d say, beaming. \n\u2018Oh, shame.\u2019 \nIt took me another three weeks to understand\
  \ that in South Africa, \u2018Oh, shame\u2019 is not necessarily a negative response.\
  \ \n\nThough we varied in our languages, traditions and baby rearing methods, we\
  \ were unified in our purpose. We\u2019d come for birth certificates. We all checked\
  \ our documentation over and over again, terrified we\u2019d get to the front of\
  \ the line after an eight hour wait only to find we\u2019d left some critical paper\
  \ at home. We all knew, by means of surreptitious peeking, which passports the others\
  \ held.\n\nAs we slid into and unpeeled ourselves from plastic chair to plastic\
  \ chair in the serpentine row that marked our journey to the front of the line,\
  \ the family behind us grew more and more anxious, their sweating increased. We\
  \ were nearing the final curve of the chair snake when the mother finally approached\
  \ me sheepishly.  Her eyes were round and brown and searching. She turned them away\
  \ from me as she showed me her blank paperwork. She hadn\u2019t completed the application\
  \ to get her baby\u2019s birth certificate. \n\n\u2018You must complete this,\u2019\
  \ I pointed to the form.\nShe shoved the page at me in response, pointing her finger\
  \ at my chest. She put her hands together as if to pray and then opened them like\
  \ a book. She shook her head sadly. She could not read, and therefore not write.\
  \ \n\u2018Where is your husband?\u2019 I asked gently, pointing to my own husband\
  \ to explain.\n\nI never understood where her husband was, but I did understand\
  \ that she was asking me to complete her paperwork for her. I grabbed a pen and\
  \ she gratefully gave me her passport and other documentation. The application was\
  \ short and was finished quickly.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s your daughter\u2019s name?\u2019\
  \ I asked, pointing to her own name in her passport and then to her baby.\n\u2018\
  Yasmine,\u2019 she said in her lovely Somali tongue.\nI looked to my husband, who\
  \ would spell the name with a \u2018J\u2019 in his native German. \u2018How do I\
  \ spell it?\u2019 I asked him. I spelled the name several different ways, showing\
  \ her each and asking, \u2018Yasmine?\u2019 each time. She didn\u2019t know, the\
  \ letters were meaningless to her.\n\nWe were at the front, it was our turn. I sweat\
  \ as I searched her face. I was a stranger and I was choosing her daughter\u2019\
  s name. I chose the \u2018Y\u2019 and stepped forward with Shepherd in my arms.\
  \ As his birth certificate was written, I looked behind me. Her husband held her\
  \ hand and gave me an appreciative smile."
