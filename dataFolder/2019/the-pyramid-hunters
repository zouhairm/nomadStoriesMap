Text: "I sit at my laptop in a house in the hills of Visoko, a hilltop town in central\
  \ Bosnia. My house is a charming two storey redbrick perched on the side of the\
  \ hill and looking across a patchwork of similar red roofs down one side and up\
  \ to a stunning pyramid shaped structure opposite. It is seven o\u2019clock and\
  \ now dark on this warm August evening. Peppered across the steep hill sides are\
  \ a number of mosques and high towers. Since just after 5pm the traditional Muslim\
  \ calls to prayers have sounded out, warbling and deep. Since half an hour ago,\
  \ they have been joined by a full-on rave. I can\u2019t detect the source but a\
  \ heavy and tron music is now competing with the cicadas for audio dominance.\n\n\
  Dogs bark and pyramid hill is starkly dark while still visible against the blackening\
  \ sky. There are no lights or houses on the pyramid. It falls steeply and is evenly\
  \ covered in a dark vegetation. It looks almost manmade in its uniformity.\n\nThis\
  \ is where Semir, or Sam, Osmanagic, comes in. A Bosnian businessman he left Bosnia\
  \ as the war began, moving to American where he flourished. Fifteen years ago he\
  \ came home and was struck by the curious sizes and shapes of three prime pyramids\
  \ in Visoko. Thirteen years ago he founded the Bosnian Pyramids of the Sun Foundation.\
  \ The ambition of the foundation was to support excavations and construction of\
  \ an \u2018archaeological park\u2019 at the site and he has worked as director from\
  \ the beginning.\n\nThere is huge controversy over the Bosnian Pyramids. A flamboyant\
  \ and charismatic character, Osmanagic lacks some of the scientific creds and formal\
  \ archaeology training. What he lacks for in pure science is, however, knocked out\
  \ of the park by the pyramids themselves. Standing across from them earlier and\
  \ looking out on the now looming Pyramid of the Sun, there is no doubt in my mind\
  \ that these structures are not accidental or made by nature. \nEarlier we met Osmanagic\
  \ with his guides at a petrol station. We were not alone. Soon a more car loads\
  \ of visitors and indeed a coach of tourists arrived. We were greeted by the translating\
  \ team also prepared to instruct the tourists in English, German, Slovakian and\
  \ local Bosnian.\n\nThis morning it turned out was a propitious occasion. A flashing\
  \ police car and two unnumbered cars arrived. They held the prime minster of Bosnia,\
  \ Fadi Novalic, and a number of his security detail. This was a private visit we\
  \ were told. Novalic spoke with Osmanagic and a number of other people before climbing\
  \ in Osmanagic\u2019s jeep and heading up for a first look at the main pyramid from\
  \ a viewing station. \n\nWe followed suit and joining the flashing cavalcade \u2013\
  \ perhaps in Bosnia a private visit is described differently than in other countries.\
  \ We were the fourth car behind the prime minster and watched with interest the\
  \ flashing police car use its lights to stop traffic and let the ministerial cavalcade\
  \ proceed with us in tow.\n\nFirst stop was a viewing of the pyramid from the vantage\
  \ point across the short valley. Osmanagic presented his pyramid. He explains how\
  \ there were three in total and we look over with interest. There is no denying\
  \ the symmetrical lines of the structure in front of us. \n\nWe travel, again in\
  \ convoy, to his archaeology park. Then we have another short lecture in the modest\
  \ exhibition centre. Pictorial evidence of artefacts and representations of the\
  \ energy fields are displayed and explained.\n\nThe main Pyramid of the Sun has\
  \ been measured with its northern side matching Cosmic North with an error of zero\
  \ degrees, zero minutes and only twelve seconds. Fossilised leaves discovered in\
  \ the walls of the tunnels have been carbon dated to 30,000 years ago. \n\nThis\
  \ alone will set the historians in a flutter as history will have to be rewritten.\
  \ As Osmanagich says: \u201DAlmost everything they have taught us about ancient\
  \ history is wrong.\u201D Is there any wonder these pyramids are the centre of such\
  \ controversy"
