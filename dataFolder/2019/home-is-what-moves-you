Text: "I think people have a tendency to dream big, then shy away from risk and opportunity.\
  \ One of the most important things I\u2019ve learned from travelling is to not be\
  \ afraid to take a leap or to take a wrong turn. Travelling is about thrusting yourself\
  \ into the open wilderness of new places and engaging in all the magic that our\
  \ world has to offer. \nIn 2016, I embarked on my third journey to Europe. My world\
  \ was turned upside down when I stumbled upon the small town of Lagos in the Algarve\
  \ region of Portugal. With the intention of only staying a few days, I was sucked\
  \ into the vortex and couldn\u2019t bear to leave the breathtaking coast. I took\
  \ up work as a bartender and moved into the tiniest apartment you\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ where I fell into the paradise of seaside living. \nIt was here, in Lagos, where\
  \ I met the person who would soon embark on the journey of a lifetime with me. Lagos\
  \ had won him over too, and together we found ourselves wandering aimlessly through\
  \ the endless nightlife. We shared a bond that felt like a secret, something that\
  \ only the two of us could feel. It felt as though it was us against the vortex,\
  \ and we soon realized that it was now or never. \nWe sat side by side, all night\
  \ long, on the silent shoreline of Praia de Batata talking crap and dreaming big.\
  \ All we could hear was the crash of the waves and our own voices. We dreamed of\
  \ fleeing. We talked of a nomadic life, where the only thing driving us was our\
  \ burning desire to wander. \n\n\tAn opportunity had risen, so we leapt. \n\nThe\
  \ next day, we packed our bags and set off to purchase our very own home on wheels.\
  \ It was a little workers\u2019 van we had found on the equivalent of Portuguese\
  \ Kijiji. It had been stripped down to nothing but the bones and wheels. We fell\
  \ in love with it and set off to make it ours. The trouble began almost immediately,\
  \ when the bed we had purchased didn\u2019t fit in the back. Not to worry though,\
  \ Joseph ran to the shops, bought a saw, and sawed the damn thing in half! These\
  \ little hiccups happened frequently throughout our travels, but they\u2019re what\
  \ kept us going. They gave us the struggle that made everything feel real and they\
  \ taught us that no wrong turn is a dead end. \nJoseph and I travelled across fifteen\
  \ countries in that van. We lived out of the back of it for nearly six months and\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t trade a single mosquito bite or flat tire for anything in the\
  \ world. We followed mountain ranges and hidden valleys, coastal routs and island\
  \ ferries, all to find that home truly is whatever moves you. Home is that burning\
  \ desire in the pit of your stomach that says you must wander. It is the strength\
  \ that carries you, it is the risk and the opportunity and the triumph and the defeat.\
  \ Home is whatever you need it to be, and for us, it was four wheels and the open\
  \ road."
