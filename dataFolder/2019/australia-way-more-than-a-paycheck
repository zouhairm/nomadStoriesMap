Text: "Yesterday marked 1 year since I filled my wee little lungs with the eucalyp\
  \ air of Australia.\U0001F30F\U0001F1E6\U0001F1FA\U0001F428\n\nArriving a jobless\
  \ and confused little mongrel I wasn't sure I'd be staying; 2 years twirling around\
  \ asia adorned with nothing but a backpack and a directionless compass; following\
  \ my heart instead of a plan, and now here I was, back in the west and reluctantly\
  \ trading the mantra-laden rudraksh around my wrists for golden handcuffs from the\
  \ man. \n\n...At least that's what I felt I was getting myself into.\n\nBut Australia\
  \ ya cheeky little mistress. You had so much more to offer than a paycheck!\n\n\
  Your Streets showcase buildings akin to the wild west, murals excitedly show off\
  \ their colours on every corner, a country filled with a warm people; every \"g'day\"\
  \ teasing a wee little smile from my glowing heart. Spiders big enough to cuddle\
  \ and no timtam safe from a midnight possum. \n\nEntire environmentally conscious\
  \ neighbourhoods with a reusable water bottle strapped to every tote bag. Coffee\
  \ shops lined with ecowarriors, themselves armed with reusable coffee cups. \n\n\
  Seas blanketed with the sweet song of whales, sprinkled with leaping dolphins during\
  \ the day and shining with luminescent plankton at night. \n\nSipping on ya wine\
  \ in a bag instead of a bottle whilst Tropical flowers smile at me from tall and\
  \ mystical forests. \n\nLiving in a city in Australia yet go an hour in any direction\
  \ and you've delved into blue mountain forests bursting with the scent of Eucalyptus,\
  \ beaches gleaming with blue oceans boasting world class surfers, Bush modestly\
  \ hiding ancient aboriginal carvings. Every event initiated with a moment of respect\
  \ for and acknowledgement of the true custodians of the land.. aboriginal land,\
  \ always was, always will be.\n\nIt's not hard to wonder why no matter what twist\
  \ of fate lead a man here, he'd give his favourite kidney for permanent residency.\n\
  \nI even caught myself enjoying my job, getting endless inspiration from a full\
  \ power woman of a manager who found a kickass way to help the woman of Tanzania\
  \ during her spare time.\n\nAustralia, you won my heart ya wee lamington."
