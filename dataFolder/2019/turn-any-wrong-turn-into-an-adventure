Text: "Those who know me understand the importance and level of respect I have for\
  \ money which means anything that has to do with the words \"free\" and \"discount\"\
  , is where I will be found if I ever go missing. \n\nI am in a long distance relationship\
  \ and this forces me to embrace travel. Being a young black woman from a developing\
  \ country, South Africa, makes travel a dream no matter where I find myself because\
  \ in my community, women are supposed to just get married, have kids and watch movies\
  \ in the hopes that it fills the void of wanting to travel- you see the world throuhg\
  \ movies. \n\nThis past Christmas, my boyfriend and I made a deal that I would visit\
  \ the Netherlands in the hopes that I would see snow for the first time in my life\
  \ (uhm yes, I have never seen snow). We planned the whole trip since from July 2018.\
  \ Lucky for us, we found cheap return flights back and forth. Christmas came and\
  \ it happened, everything was great except that the snow I went to see never happened.\
  \ That was just the beginning of the adventure, as it ended- the begining of an\
  \ end. \n\nOn my way back home, there was a long layover in Kenya for a connecting\
  \ flight and as circumstances go, our flight found itself grounded in Livingstone.\
  \ I was starting work the next day and it was made clear to us that there was no\
  \ way our flight would be leaving so basically, I was missing work. \n\nLucky for\
  \ us, the airline arranged a stay for everyone in Livingstone and guess what!!!\
  \ 10 minutes away from that hotel was the Victoria Falls! I was lucky enough that\
  \ most of the other passengers that were also stuck were keen on visiting the falls\
  \ and one of them made sure everything was arranged the money of leaving the Zambia\
  \ before our flight got fixed. \n\nWe took our time to the falls with a local taxi\
  \ picking us up early morning (I wanted to cancel because I was so tired and angry).\
  \ We went to the falls and my oh my was I not grateful to be there! Looking into\
  \ the Falls, it looks like a giant is pouring water into a water seal and somehow\
  \ in the giant's world, there is this bucket where the water is going. It felt like\
  \ I was walking in a rain forest but with so much cool breeze and air and lots of\
  \ life. I felt like I was going to step off the edge and float from the water sprays.\
  \ \n\nAs I always preach to my friends and social media followers that they must\
  \ always look at getting lost as not just that but as a way to learn, connect and\
  \ be free to know that anything is possible- I mean, what could go worse?"
