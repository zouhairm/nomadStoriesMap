Text: "My swashbuckling brother Malcolm and I slept in some interesting places the\
  \ summer we hitched from Paris to Greece. Under the stars on the rumbling deck of\
  \ the Brindizi ferryboat. In the cabin of an Italian trucker. On the trash-strewn\
  \ side of a highway near Bari, large rats running by our heads. In a sunny olive\
  \ grove, till the owners booted us for showing their kids a snake we caught.\nThen\
  \ there was the day we foolishly thought we\u2019d stop in Cannes on Bastille Day;\
  \ the very day the French go on holiday - en masse.\nRides had been good, mostly\
  \ truckers. Now, endless lines of cars stuffed with beach toys, kids gawking at\
  \ us. Sun-scorched, filthy, we were none too pretty. Malcolm finally said, \u201C\
  Man, can you put on some make-up? We\u2019re never gonna get a ride.\u201D And he\
  \ had a point. I did put on some eyeliner and we DID get that last ride.\nWe coasted\
  \ into glamorous Cannes, blue, palm-lined sea to our right, glossy shops exuding\
  \ style to the left, in a sleek leathery air-conditioned sedan, \u201CEasy like\
  \ Sunday morning\u201D playing on the radio...bliss.\nThen, more sweaty lugging\
  \ of backpacks, fighting the crowds in search of a hostel - fruitlessly. Aaand my\
  \ period started, so I wanted a steady supply of bathroom. We decided to exit this\
  \ paradise ASAP. Found our way to the waterfront road that leads to Monaco. \nAh,\
  \ the Riviera - white sand, Kodak sky, Rolexes, and us - unpleasingly pink, sticky\
  \ and grouchy. Malcolm, usually an unsinkable adventurer, threw his backpack down,\
  \ growling \u201CYOU get us a ride.\u201D\nI sighed, shrugged, took my thumb over\
  \ to the curb, and SCREECH. A cute French couple pops out of a miniature car and\
  \ tosses our stuff in their trunk before we\u2019ve even told them our destination.\n\
  \u201CCome with us for a drink first?\u201D The wife has long dark-blonde hair and\
  \ adorable wide-spaced gold and green speckled eyes. For some reason I was in front\
  \ with handsome, soft-spoken Hubby, while Wife was in back with Malcolm, whose irritation\
  \ had inexplicably vanished. \u201CWhy not?\u201D\nIt was awkward, with no common\
  \ language. We drove on, and on, the streets losing their glamour with each kilometer,\
  \ and I started worrying. Were they after our backpacks? Ransom? But Malc is a tough,\
  \ street-smart guy, so I tried to trust his instincts and we drove on.  It was dark\
  \ when Hubby finally stopped in a silent grim, gritty neighborhood.\nTheir humble\
  \ flat had kids toys here and there. Malc went to the bathroom. Then the wife disappeared,\
  \ leaving me, uncomfortably, at the kitchen table with Hubby and a glass of wine.\
  \ He spoke no English and my French is only as good as my mood and my mood was suspicious\
  \ and fearful. Finally, Hubby puts his hand on mine. I\u2019m shocked. But not scared\
  \ anymore. I look at his hand. I move my hand away. He turns red.\nMeanwhile, Malcolm\u2019\
  s brushing his teeth in the mirror when the beautiful wife appears and starts, well,\
  \ bridging the language gap.\nLuckily for me, Malcolm\u2019s a good brother so after\
  \ considering my plight he reluctantly tore himself away from her. \nThey were very\
  \ disappointed when we announced our departure. As we left I heard her saying \u201C\
  it\u2019s not MY fault - HE likes ME!\u201D Poor Hubby.\nSince the disgruntled swingers\
  \ had no interest in driving us back we were now stuck in a deserted immigrant neighborhood\
  \ trying to hitch at midnight. Things had looked brighter back in Bari with those\
  \ rats.\nYet within a couple of hours Etienne, a 17-year-old with long-hair and\
  \ John Lennon specs, picked us up, expertly ditched a slightly seedy tag-along I\
  \ had attracted, and turned to ask, \u201CNOW, where do you want to go?\u201D\n\u201C\
  We\u2019re trying to get out of Cannes.\u201D\n \u201CIt will be hard to get a ride\
  \ to Monaco so late. But stay with me tonight and I will take you tomorrow.\u201D\
  \nReally?!\nMalc looks a question at me - the one with all the fears. \u201CYes,\
  \ please.\u201D was all I had to say. \nWe bonded over good wine, music and stories\
  \ in his parents\u2019 elegant, book-lined flat. Best sleep of the trip."
