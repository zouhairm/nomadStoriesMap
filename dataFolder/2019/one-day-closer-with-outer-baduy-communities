  \ different before. Never planned by me for a trip to this village, then my friend\
  \ and I made this trip enthusiastically.\n\nBaduy communities located in the village\
  \ kanekes, banten, west java. Have a view nature because baduy communities is very\
  \ conservative. No bathroom in this village, if you want take a bath you have to\
  \ go to river. The Baduy communities is actually divided into two, namely outer\
  \ and deep, in having many provisions imposed from declining, not allowed to use\
  \ vehicles, not using footwear, the house door must face north, and may not use\
  \ technology. They still really live according to the tradition where clothing must\
  \ be made from weaving. While, outside Baduy have adapted modern technology, and\
  \ adapted they are married to the outer Baduy communities. Although different, but\
  \ not all use footwear, they go. \n\nThe trip from the village Kanekes to the house\
  \ of a resident is approximately one hour with a rocky road and a little steep.\
  \ For us who live in the capital will find it difficult and take a long time to\
  \ get there We met with boy dress up black with the headband blue. Wandi his name,\
  \ one of the communities from outer baduy the city ushered us to his house, we met\
  \ on the bus to the village of Kanekes. We said that we wanted to visit the houses\
  \ of the residents. then he was willing to accompany us Baduy communities is very\
  \ friendly even we can spend the night at their house for tourists. Throughout the\
  \ journey he told me a lot about the Baduy communities. He said that in this communities\
  \ there were many who could not speak national languages. Only local languages can\
  \ be used, here too many children do not go to school, Wandi learned autodidact\
  \ to be able speak national language and read.  their daily work is gardening and\
  \ selling. We see children playing very happy without gadget. \n\nWandi allowed\
  \ us to stay overnight in his house to bring us closer to the life of the tribe\
  \ of Baduy. In the evening, the wife of Wandi had entertained us with drinking water\
  \ and cassava from their garden. But because we were tired we rested for a while\
  \ then showered in the river, along the path to the river using a flashlight because\
  \ there was no light and we had to be careful when walking, we lit lanterns and\
  \ cooked instant noodles for us, we also had dinner together between candles. We\
  \ only talked with Wandi because the wife of the Wandi could not speak national\
  \ languages. Wandi told us about the life baduy communities.  I ate my noodles,\
  \ walked out to see the star of the night which was clearly visible in my eyes,\
  \ the atmosphere of the night was very quiet cold air began to stab my skin, I used\
  \ a jacket and then back into the house Wandi. Then we sleep\n\nWe woke up at 5am.\
  \ We wanted to enjoy the surrounding house of the Baduy communities, we went around\
  \ along the houses of the residents. The sound of gurgling river water accompanied\
  \ our steps that morning. I breathe very fresh air which is very different when\
  \ I am in the capital that has been exposed to pollution. After driving around we\
  \ returned to the Wandi house. Wandi's wife preparing breakfast for us again and\
  \ we had breakfast together. Then we said goodbye to go back to the capital. The\
  \ great experience with the baduy communities."
