Text: "I had just returned to my room when the hotel porter shared the dismal news\
  \ with me.  Two political leaders had been assassinated in the adjacent town of\
  \ Kishtewar. Subsequently, a valley wide curfew was imposed.  Vehicular activity\
  \ had ceased completely. Kashmir and its sister valley Bhaderwah were often plagued\
  \ by abrupt curfews and strikes.\n\nThe daily excursions I had been undertaking\
  \ in Bhaderwah had nearly emptied out my wallet. I decided to talk to the hotel\
  \ owner about my predicament. He remained adamant about the rent, irrespective of\
  \ the curfew. Moreover, since the shops and restaurants were closed, I was solely\
  \ dependent on the expensive hotel food.\n\nThat night I received a phone call from\
  \ Sajaad Ji, my local guide. \u201CThe curfew would last for a week at least,\u201D\
  \ he said. His words struck me like a blow. I shared my financial crisis with him.\
  \ He took a brief pause, and invited me to stay with him until a viable way out\
  \ was discovered. Having no other choice, I put my trust in him. I cleared my dues,\
  \ packed my bags, and tried to sleep.\n\nWe met outside the hotel at five in the\
  \ morning. He couldn\u2019t risk driving, so we walked to his place. It was an hour\
  \ long walk. The silence was palpable and neither one of us tried to break it. Bhaderwah\
  \ was sound asleep as I marveled at its serenity. Even in the dark, the snow-laden\
  \ landscape looked surreal, delicate as a dream. We reached his house, a modest\
  \ wooden dwelling, just around the break of dawn. Spinach leaves, crowned with a\
  \ layer of snow, sat crestfallen in the front yard. His wife, an old lady with a\
  \ brilliantly fair complexion, welcomed us with a cup of local tea called Kehwa.\
  \ It was garnished with pieces of walnuts, and was truly an elixir for the ruthless\
  \ Bhaderwahi winters.\n\nSajaad Ji told me about a friend of his who would be driving\
  \ to the town of Doda tomorrow. I would be able to board the bus to my hometown\
  \ from there. He ran his fingers through his beard as he talked. He looked concerned,\
  \ as if my plight was his own.  \n\nI hesitated at the thought of staying overnight.\
  \ He waved all my scruples away. \u201CThis modest house belongs to Allah. You have\
  \ as much claim to it as my wife and I do.\u201D There was no more protesting. I\
  \ felt grateful and thanked them both. \n\nI was checking my camera equipment when\
  \ Sajaad Ji walked in with freshly plucked spinach leaves still covered in snow.\
  \ \u201CSnow makes it taste sweeter. You\u2019ll see,\u201D he said. A smile adorned\
  \ his face.\n\nAt dusk, the sun hung low, forcing the sky in a capricious mood.\
  \ Upon the call of Azaan, the old couple kneeled on the ground and commenced with\
  \ a meditating trance - palms raised to form a bowl, and lips weaving together inaudible\
  \ prayers. The sight of their praying brought me closer to God. I wanted to take\
  \ a photograph, but decided against it. That which is divine, is often too humane\
  \ to be understood; and hence, easily overlooked. My camera stayed down, my eyes\
  \ remained transfixed.\n\nThe spinach was sweet indeed. We went to bed soon afterwards.\
  \ At three in the morning, Sajaad Ji roused me from my slumber and asked me to get\
  \ ready. As I walked towards the door, I felt a solemn melancholy taking over me.\
  \ I could not understand why. After all, I was leaving a stranger\u2019s home for\
  \ mine. Then why this sudden melancholy?\n\nHis wife stood waiting by the door.\
  \ Her kind eyes fell upon me. Her face, hardened with years of toiling, managed\
  \ a weak smile. She kissed my forehead gently, and blessed it with prayers.\n\n\u201C\
  Allah Hafiz,\u201D she said. May God protect you.\n\u201CAllah Hafiz,\u201D I replied.\n\
  \nI sat in the backseat of the car, heading towards Doda, when my phone rang. It\
  \ was Sajaad Ji. He said, \u201CWe were having breakfast and thought of you. Next\
  \ time you visit, be sure to have breakfast with us.\u201D\n\nMy heart grew heavier\
  \ in my chest. I thought to myself, \u201CWhat good did I do to deserve such kindness?\u201D"
