Text: "In all your travels, of the places that you will see, live and breathe in,\
  \ you will inevitably come across one city that will feel familiar. The fabric would\
  \ be new but its weave would be known; the faces might be new but the stories, your\
  \ own. And you will leave that city with certain images stitched in your memory\
  \ forever, images that will always remind you of home. Back in 2014, when I first\
  \ alighted the platforms of Jaipur, the air was warm with welcome and it has remained\
  \ unchanged, unfazed through all this time. Every visit to the city has revolved\
  \ around the familiar welcome in the air and the very same nostalgic good-byes in\
  \ all the fourteen visits I have made so far.\n\nThey will always introduce Jaipur\
  \ to you as the Pink City, attributing the magnificence to the one colour that was\
  \ once adopted to welcome the queen of England and has since then been maintained\
  \ as an identity. Yet, your visits to this glorious city would always be painted\
  \ in with a multitude of colours. For someone like me, the city surprisingly has\
  \ colours enough to produce new hues for each new arrival. There is a rich history\
  \ that defines the streets of the old city; the synchronicity of shops, busy lanes,\
  \ a hundred delicacies that tempt you to overfill your tummy, the beautifully carved\
  \ jaalis (screens), mehrabs, chhatri and such ornamental architectural features\
  \ on buildings that pass by, that leave you in awe of the artist of yore. The entrances\
  \ of countless monuments have been adorned with detailed paintings, the colours\
  \ extracted from vegetables and gem stones, leaving them strong and new even after\
  \ years of use. It is the busyness of these streets, the pinkness of the buildings,\
  \ the intriguing trinkets that can be found in the shops that lend character to\
  \ the old city of Jaipur. To the new city, the character comes from smooth wide\
  \ roads, plantations by their sides and the circles at traffic junctions so huge\
  \ that almost all of them are used as picnic parks.\n\nOne of the most enthralling\
  \ parts of the city is the Mirza Ismail Road, more popularly known as M.I. Road.\
  \ It begins with the smell of tender meat cooked in Rajasthani spices on your right,\
  \ while the mouth watering aromas of vegetarian delicacies on the left, both from\
  \ tiny-greasy shops that serve the most delicious food in the city. Almost always\
  \ the character suddenly changes and you find yourself standing amidst posh shops\
  \ with glittery facades, a dozen clothing brands, big hotels and expensive jewelry\
  \ stores. A few steps forward and one would come to the popular lassiwala, a shop\
  \ that promptly closes at two in the afternoon but serves the most tempting lassi\
  \ in the entire city. MI Road goes on for another kilometer-and-half showcasing\
  \ a myriad of age-old markets and little strutting lanes that lead you to the inner\
  \ shabby areas of those glitzy exteriors, to the walled pink city and leaves you\
  \ with a myriad images, scents and sights fixed in your heart.\n\nThe old city is\
  \ eponymous for housing the Jantar Mantar, the City Palace, Hawa Mahal, Albert Hall\
  \ and further ahead, Jal Mahal, Gaitore, Nahargarh Fort, Jaigarh Fort and the most\
  \ widely known, Amer (Amber) Fort. These are monuments which have through time made\
  \ the city of  Jaipur popular through India and the rest of the world alike. And\
  \ yet, it wouldn\u2019t do justice if I told you that these are all that make up\
  \ that beautiful city. The true essence of the pink city lies in those pretty pink\
  \ facades, in the tiny paintings on a million walls, those intricate Jaalis and\
  \ Jharokhas. It lies in the people and their unmatched hospitality, in the million\
  \ colours that dazzle in the markets. It lies in the sweets \u2013 Ghewar, Phirni,\
  \ and Churma, in the Kachoris and Dal Batis, in Keema Baati, Laal Maas and Shikanjis.\
  \ Such is the air in the capital of Rajasthan, that no matter how short or long\
  \ my stay might be, my heart forever remains captured in that city in pink."
