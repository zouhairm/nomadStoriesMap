Text: "I moved to Spain 3 years ago as a former TV journalist and musical theatre\
  \ performer and I\u2019ve lived in 5 countries - England, USA, Hong Kong, China\
  \ and Spain and travelled to over 60, extensively, BUT this, is the most racist\
  \ country I\u2019ve ever lived in. \n\nI want to talk about how being someone with\
  \ 4 nationalities means it\u2019s hard to find your place in the world but it\u2019\
  s also easy to fit into and feel comfortable in different cultures. My grandfather\
  \ was 100% basque and left Spain during the war in a diaspora to find a better life\
  \ in Shanghai. \n\nMy other grandfather was a Scottish RAF fighter  pilot stationed\
  \ in Hong Kong in world war 2. \n\nOne grandmother was Persian and Chinese. The\
  \ other was Chinese. \n\nI made the decision to move to Spain, 3 years ago, and\
  \ have had a really hard time settling in. I\u2019ve had to deal with peoples\u2019\
  \ jealousy, betrayal, dishonesty, lack of trust and misunderstanding of who I am,\
  \ why I\u2019m there and what I want. \n\nIn all honesty, I just do what I want\
  \ because I don\u2019t give a fuck what people think of me and my self worth is\
  \ not defined by what people think of me, but I do see a sickness here, in their\
  \ mentality. \n\nI want to write about the sadness and despair I feel at the way\
  \ the Basque people live their life and how I see them dying as a race, if they\
  \ don\u2019t change their attitudes and behaviour towards the rest of the world.\
  \ \n\nI feel strongly about this, because I am Basque and if anyone was to write\
  \ this story, it would be me. I\u2019m not attacking them, but I come from a point\
  \ of view where I care, \n\nI\u2019m not sure that I will stay in this country and\
  \ for how long.....because everyday is a challenge. Everyday is a constant battle\
  \ with somebody who \nmakes a mistake in their everyday work that involves me, where\
  \ I spend twice as long trying to correct it because of the inefficiency of the\
  \ working culture....everyday is another day when someone judges, mistrusts or just\
  \ overall misunderstands me and my honest and good, intentions. \n\nEveryday is\
  \ another day that somebody looks at me and knows I\u2019m not Basque and judges\
  \ me, in that split second, based on my appearance...and I have to spend some conscious\
  \ time and effort trying to shift their persepective on WHO I am, so they can learn\
  \ or try to trust me. It is a constant constant battle and there are days when I\
  \ don\u2019t see the light at the end of this tunnel....but then I remember this\
  \ one quote by Brad Pitt - \n\n\u201CBe the Shark. Keep Moving.\u201D \n\nAnd I\
  \ don\u2019t quit."
