Text: "Just as Ethiopian Airlines launched, I was expanding my knowledge of Africa,\
  \ because only once you\u2019re away from your people you realise how many things\
  \ you do not know about them, your own culture, and in this case your continent.\
  \ You also start appreciating things that you never thought about or took for granted.\n\
  Having been a South African living in Leipzig (Germany), people took it as a given\
  \ that I am the one to ask all their questions to about Africa\u2026 the continent\
  \ yes, not the country...but let's leave that there ;)\n\nAfter realizing how little\
  \ I knew about north and East Africa, and that the questioning was not going to\
  \ stop anytime soon, I decided to live up to their expectations and started reading\
  \ up on and studying the histories and cultures of several African countries.\n\
  One country that I fell in love with and became completely fascinated by was Ethiopia,\
  \ mainly because it remained an ancient culture that is largely uninfluenced by\
  \ external elements. Therefore I didn\u2019t think twice when I saw the flight offers\
  \ via Ethiopia as I thought that it is the perfect opportunity to get a little closer\
  \ to this mythical country. I booked my return flights between Germany and South\
  \ Africa and was delighted with the service and quality I found as well as the fact\
  \ that Ethiopian Airlines had one of the newest fleets in the world!\n\nOn my return\
  \ flight between Frankfurt and Addis Ababa I sat next to an Ethiopian lady, Hazel,\
  \ and her son\u2026Daniel. Soon after take-off, Daniel was trying to switch on his\
  \ screen but with no success, and with Hazel seeming to be taking a nap, I took\
  \ it upon myself to come to the rescue. With both Daniels being in Germany for not\
  \ a very long time, the German being used was\u2026uhm\u2026 unique. But somehow,\
  \ we managed to establish that he wants to play a game, so I helped him to find\
  \ the one he wanted. \nWhen Hazel opened her eyes, she was not quite sure what to\
  \ make of me playing on her son\u2019s screen but luckily this time he came to my\
  \ rescue and quickly cleared up the situation. Once little Daniel was settled, Hazel\
  \ and I introduced ourselves and started the usual \u201Cstrangers on a plane chat\u201D\
  .  We started talking about Ethiopia and she was quite impressed with my knowledge\
  \ of her home country (Thank you to those who thought Africa is a country and expected\
  \ me to know all these things). I told her about my fascination and admiration for\
  \ Ethiopia and she told me about her love for Germany. She was quite upset and scolding\
  \ me about the fact that I lived in Leipzig and have never been to the Leipzig Zoo,\
  \ which she regards as the best in the world, all confirmed by Daniel of course.\
  \ \n\nHazel gave me tips on places to visit and experiences to experience in Ethiopia,\
  \ for the day that I finally will undertake my planned trip. After about an hour,\
  \ or at least so it felt, our six-hour flight was over, and we arrived in Frankfurt.\
  \ She opened the overhead locker and said \u201CDaniel\u201D, both of us looked\
  \ up be she was looking at me with a warm smile, saying, \u201CI thought I might\
  \ need it for the German summer, but you will need it much more in Ethiopia\u201D\
  , and gave me a beautiful traditional Ethiopian woven high grass hat for my future\
  \ trip. We went our own separate ways in a new country, but together in spirit as\
  \ Africans.\n\nMy hat is high and ready for you Ethiopia, see you soon!\n\nDaniel"
