Text: "\u201CS\xED, se\xF1orita. I may not know much, but there\u2019s a place I like\
  \ to go to at the end of the day,\u201D said Don Goyo while we were enjoying the\
  \ freshness of standing in front of the very beginning of the so-called Fog Forest\
  \ (Bosque de Niebla). The forest ran parallel along the endless maize field were\
  \ we had been working for the last few days. After recovering our breaths, we entered\
  \ deep into the woods, following a sound of water that led us to a stream crossed\
  \ by a wooden bridge. Diaphanous sunlight filtered through the leaves, glittering\
  \ on the waters of a small pond.\n\nThat day we had been working under a benumbing\
  \ sun, for about three, four, maybe five hours; planting one maize seed for every\
  \ three bean ones, using the coa \u2013the wonderful stick developed by the natives\
  \ of the Americas, which although avoids going down on the knees and dig, does not\
  \ prevent from piercing the ground in an artisan fashion.\n\nDon Goyo, with infinite\
  \ patience and his characteristic down-to-the-earth stare had been teaching me how\
  \ to sink firmly the stick, turn it to one side and then the other until the hole\
  \ to keep the seeds was ready. Every time he came back to where I was \u2013to either\
  \ give me directions or simply check in my work\u2014, he did it with an affable\
  \ smile on his face.\n\nDon Goyo was a being of contrasts. Serene and even-tempered,\
  \ he seemed fragile while walking lithely, in what at times looked like a series\
  \ of slow motion steps that could easily be attributed to his age.  However, when\
  \ it came to work, he turned into this bull-being of unmatched strength: his whole\
  \ body recovered a youthful vigor that rejuvenated him immediately. \n\nDuring the\
  \ whole day I could see the tireless farmer going from one side of the field to\
  \ the other, enduring \u2013without complaints, without any tinges of discomfort\u2014\
  \ the suffocating sun, the dry weather. He didn\u2019t talk while he worked, fully\
  \ committed to his labour; rather, he would simply approve, nod, show; which is\
  \ why that unexpected utterance, coming completely out of the blue, startled me.\
  \ \n\nNo sooner had I recovered from his remark than he gesticulated me to follow\
  \ him. I did not dare, or more precisely, I couldn\u2019t disobey. Perhaps because\
  \ I was still lethargic from the hard work; perhaps even more because of the inertia\
  \ of being following orders for the last hours without a murmur. But somehow, while\
  \ immersing myself into that forest, it seemed that we were heading to an unknown\
  \ place where weather, time and creatures interacting around us turned into something\
  \ of ethereal beauty.\n\n\u201CI like to come here,\u201D replied Don Goyo again\
  \ when we finally got there and stopped on the other side of the bridge. After that,\
  \ silence reigned. There was no more need for words \u2013words were just left over.\
  \ It was a shared moment of sensation and purification; of gratitude, of infinite\
  \ peace, of deep connection, of null loneliness. \n\nI have no idea how long we\
  \ were there in front of the river. What I just recall is the night of that day\
  \ in which a girl from the city \u2013that I was\u2014 couldn\u2019t believe how\
  \ she could connect with someone the way she did (beyond words) with a man from\
  \ the fields."
