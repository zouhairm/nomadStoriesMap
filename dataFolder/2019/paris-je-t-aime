Text: "I have always had a bit of a love/hate relationship with Paris. When I first\
  \ came as a child, I was enchanted: the language I had been speaking inside the\
  \ classroom for years was actually used by real-life people on the streets, and\
  \ it was totally acceptable to have a whole bowl of hot chocolate for breakfast!\
  \ As I got older, the veil lifted somewhat and I started to see the not-so-glittery\
  \ side: paying exorbitant amounts of money to stand in a crowd and look at a painting\
  \ that was much smaller than expected, or the constant smelly, sticky state of the\
  \ metro. This time however, not coming strictly as a tourist or trying to fit in\
  \ as many museums as I could muster, it was a refreshingly different experience\
  \ altogether. \n\nIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day. The streets are dead, my local\
  \ friends are still asleep, and I have to be out of my hostel room by 11 AM. What\
  \ is the logical thing to do? Walk the streets, of course. \n\nThere is something\
  \ quite peculiar about Paris at this time of year. The leftovers from last night\u2019\
  s celebrations can be seen everywhere: empty wine bottles in the gutters, remnants\
  \ of sparkles and streamers line the footpaths\u2026 And yet, it is peaceful. There\
  \ are entire parts of the city where not a sound can be heard. No one seems to be\
  \ walking the streets, most of the cafes are shut, and minuscule snowflakes are\
  \ falling. Everything is still. \n\nI think Paris is most beautiful like this. There\
  \ are no obnoxiously loud people disturbing the peace, no crowds of tourists too\
  \ interested in their phones to notice they are about to collide with cyclists\u2026\
  \ You can walk around and appreciate the city\u2019s architectural delights just\
  \ as they are.\nAfter an hour or so wandering these silent streets, cold and hunger\
  \ were getting the best of me, and eventually I found a \u201Cbistrot\u201D that\
  \ was open at Bastille. Nestled at a classically Parisian table \u2013 of course\
  \ frontward-looking for optimal people watching \u2013 I ordered an espresso and\
  \ a pain au chocolat.\n\nOver 200 years since the revolution, on what is probably\
  \ Paris\u2019 quietest day of the year, it is not so difficult to imagine this area\
  \ being stormed by the malcontent bourgeoisie. Despite the dozens of cafes now surrounding\
  \ the square, the taxis , and the sideshow carnival in the background, this place\
  \ maintains its air of history. The idyllic buildings of the Belle \xC9poque remain,\
  \ and the slow-flowing Seine with its beautifully arched bridges is a constant presence.\
  \ \n\nMaybe the fact that I\u2019m Australian has made me unaccustomed to such rich\
  \ history and culture being so immediately visible, but there is definitely something\
  \ magical about Paris. The quiet of New Year makes it even more enchanting, as though\
  \ the city is trapped in time.\n\nWalking the streets alone this morning, sipping\
  \ my coffee and people watching from my cosy caf\xE9, although objectively rather\
  \ monotonous, was a simply glorious way to spend the morning. If today was anything\
  \ to go by, I think I can be relatively confident that 2019 is going to be equally\
  \ captivating."
