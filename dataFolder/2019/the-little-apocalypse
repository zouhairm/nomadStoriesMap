Text: "The temperature reached around 31 degrees Celsius outside when I visited to\
  \ Phuket Aquarium in South Thailand. My tour guide\u2014a black-haired cheerful\
  \ Thai man with a name that difficult to pronounce and remember even now\u2014was\
  \ explaining to us about a black starfish life cycle. After allowed us to touched\
  \ that black starfish, we walked to another room with bigger aquarium in our right,\
  \ and information booth on our left.\n  \nInstead of told us what kind of sea creature\
  \ inside big aquarium in right, he preferred to paused on booth information in left.\
  \ The information booth displayed to remember one of the biggest and deadliest disaster\
  \ in recorded history. His expression turned flat while staring straight at the\
  \ photo on booth. \u201CThis is the photo of Kamala Beach, before and after that\
  \ day\u201D he continued, \u201CAll around me shaking for a few minutes. It was\
  \ clear that was an earthquake but I thought it was just small local quakes. Never\
  \ crossed my mind about what was coming afterwards\u201D\n \nHis eyes moved to information\
  \ table filled by list of countries with its number of victims.\n \n\u201CQuickly\
  \ after there were large wave heading to the shoreline, wiped out all the buildings\
  \ in front of it. Tsunami attacked very quick, thereafter I heard a cry for help\
  \ and shouting of pain, we were surrounded by fear at that time\u201D He smiled\
  \ bitterly as he thought about it, \u201CIt was the worst day of my entire life\u201D\
  \n \nAn undersea earthquake on 2004 with magnitude of 9.1 centered in the west coast\
  \ of northern Sumatra, Indonesia generated tsunami that hit Thailand, and other\
  \ 13 countries with estimated 225,000 people killed."
