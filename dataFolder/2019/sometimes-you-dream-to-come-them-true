Text: 'I like start with the word sometimes, because defines almost many thoughts
  in the clouds of your dreams.


  When You''re younger, you think the world is yours, "but" (because in life there
  is always a but), you realise that sometimes is not so simple as we thought. There
  is a battle, first to find you in your universe (lucky one who born knowing who
  they are, but, weat about the others...), But sure is one thing, may you don''t
  know what is your purpose at life, but one thing is sure, may you have the dream
  to now the world, and why?, Well the answer is so simple, out there is so big and
  there is a lot of things to know, find, admire and grow with the world outside of
  your mind.


  Sometimes... You are not part of a family with the culture of travel, to discover
  what is outside, but you born with that instinct of adventure and imagination, that
  the only thing you want is wait the "perfect time" to do it; but of course may you
  are not the one who born so confident about yourself and with the years you are
  being discovering yourself, working as hole for what? ... You may not part of the
  bravest people who decided married and have children... May you just have a pet...
  Single and well ... Maybe what you need is something unexpected...


  Dreams are to made them real, no matter where or who others think who you are, you
  wake up every day to learn, enjoy and live the time you have.


  You take all your chances to do what you want do ...


  The story is discover the world outside your mind an the usual things you grow an
  believe.'
