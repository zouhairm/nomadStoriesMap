Text: "It was a few days before Christmas and I was standing at the front desk ready\
  \ to get my marching orders for my first night as Night Manager, a job I would take\
  \ very seriously despite only being a volunteer worker, when the bell at the gate\
  \ rings.  Cautiously, she walked around the corner with her guiding stick I later\
  \ find out she calls Seymour, and two local children in tow who were nice enough\
  \ to lead her to the town guesthouse and carry her bags.  Her name was Kyama, not\
  \ her given name but a name she had chosen that she was told meant strength. She\
  \ was looking for a room and to potentially stay a while, as she was searching for\
  \ a new home. After checking her in, I asked the owner if it was common to have\
  \ these types of nomads come through the guesthouse. Apparently Australia has a\
  \ fair amount of people on assistance, especially those with disabilities, and it\u2019\
  s not unusual to have people come stay for up to a month occasionally. In her case,\
  \ she only lost her sight ten years ago. My grandmother lost her sight late in life\
  \ and maybe that\u2019s why I went out of my way to make sure she could move around\
  \ the guesthouse without having a major incident or maybe I just wanted to dig deeper\
  \ into understanding how a 60-something year old, blind woman has arrived in this\
  \ small town of 2000 people looking to resettle here. The next day I asked if she\
  \ wanted to join me down at the river.  We stood shin-deep in the cool, clean water\
  \ while the hot December sun warmed our faces.  She told me about her daughters,\
  \ that she\u2019s working on repairing her relationship with them, her ex-husband\
  \ who she doesn\u2019t speak to any more, her former home in Darwin she decided\
  \ to leave after 19 years to start a new life elsewhere.  She used to be a hypnotherapist\
  \ before she lost her vision, so now she isn\u2019t working.  She also revealed\
  \ the reason she hadn\u2019t had the cataract surgery. Apparently, the doctor never\
  \ got back to her to make an appointment, which was a sign from the universe that\
  \ she wasn\u2019t \u201Cmeant\u201D to have it, something that most people would\
  \ disagree. At that moment, she was also waiting for the universe to put all the\
  \ right pieces together; that she would stumble into a coffee shop and just magically\
  \ talk to the right person who would offer her a room to rent in town. I couldn\u2019\
  t imagine leaving that much up to chance and unfortunately, neither could she. With\
  \ the holidays upon us, the guesthouse was fully booked in the upcoming days which\
  \ meant she couldn\u2019t stay, but it also meant that we couldn\u2019t just let\
  \ her wander the streets.  The owner reached out to every hotel in town, every organization\
  \ in the area, to no avail. Finally, at the last possible moment she was able to\
  \ find an organization that could take her at least for a few days, that was equipped\
  \ to support her visual impairment.  Very reluctantly, she took the placement despite\
  \ it not being what she hoped this trip to Bellingen would bring.  As we approached\
  \ the house that was going to take her in, she asked what street it was on, to which\
  \ we responded, Mykonos Street.  Much to her delight, one of her daughters is married\
  \ to a Greek, so maybe after all, the universe was guiding her in the right direction."
