Text: "Traveling has been a very important facet of my life. I started doing it as\
  \ an adult with my last couple. We visited Europe, Cuba and our last trip was a\
  \ long and deep travel to Asia. I even have a vietnamese\u2019s woman\u2019s tatoo\
  \ on my skin. \nI really think that if you want to know a person, u should travel\
  \ with him (or her). Maybe that was the reason we finally broke.\nI was very sad\
  \ and upset because all my memories about planes, new lands, and adventures were\
  \ with him. I was wondering how can I travel without my partner in crime. \nWe use\
  \ to travel and document our experiences because our goal was to create a blog.\
  \ We are both actors here in Mexico so our carreer give us the advantage of exposure.\n\
  One day, I decided to wake up, take my pieces and set against my ideas, so I decided\
  \ to travel to Peru by myself.\nAt first I was very scared, but something inside\
  \ of me felt very proud of my courage.\nI arrived to Lima, but in the plane I was\
  \ very lucky to met a guy who was a politician and a nice person,so he offered to\
  \ give me a quick stroll in the place and I accepted.\nOne of the most  interesting\
  \ things about Peru is the delicious gastronomy. That night I ate a sweat bread\
  \ called \u201CPanet\xF3n\u201D and another candy called \u201Cturr\xF3n\u201D.\
  \ Both typical Lima\u2019s desserts for Christmas.\nI met Cusco and his quinoa soap,\
  \ I went to de Rainbow mointains, the magnificent Machu Picchu, the floating Islands\
  \ of the Uros, and finally I decided to also cross the bridge and met Bolivia. \n\
  I can already feel the taste of Peru, his awesome landscapes, the beauty of people\
  \ and how they treat u as family, the \u201Ccheese and the choclo (corn)\u201D,\
  \ the witch\u2019s market\u201D in Bolivia, the beautiful adverture of redescover\
  \ myself on another country, my capacity of been alone and \nFinally I returned\
  \ home more strong that the person who left.\nEach trip transform us. We know people,\
  \ met ourselves each time better and our mind grows.\nI\u201Dll love to know each\
  \ corner of the world, take pictures and describe my spirit in the middle of each\
  \ culture."
