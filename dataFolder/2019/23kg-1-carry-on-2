Text: "This story ends -temporarily- in New York. \nBut it took me 8 years to get\
  \ there. \n\nI was born in a little town in Costa Rica, a small central-american\
  \ country. I remembered me in high school listening to my schoolmates talking about\
  \ their vacation trip or a travel gift that their parents gave them for birthday.\
  \ Traveling at that time was a rich people thing.\n\nThen I turned 18, I decided\
  \ to study art and in college the world expands and dreams begin to come true. And\
  \ suddenly, I had to pack all my things in a 23kg suitcase and a carry-on. Who would\
  \ say that those luggage characteristics would become the synthesis of what my life\
  \ would be?\n\nMy story began in Peru, a wonderful and big country that showed me\
  \ a mix of the brown and red colors from the saw, the blue and gray from the cold\
  \ lakes or the green that springs from among Inca or Quechua archaeological remains.\
  \ \n\nI climbed a snowy peak at the Andean saw, the Huascar\xE1n. My body felt tired,\
  \ my steps were too slow, the snow falling strong, my nose bleed a little bit because\
  \ of the pressure and when I arrived to the final point, people of the area told\
  \ us to ate snow to oxygen our bodies. The landscape was amazing, you simply feel\
  \ the power of the nature and all it magnificence.  At the end of the day, and old\
  \ woman gave me a Coca hot tea, a traditional beverage to relief the body in high\
  \ altitude areas, typically at the Andean mountain range. \n\nThen\u2026 the next\
  \ years were about discovering myself as a solo traveler, always having funny and\
  \ spontaneous adventures like\u2026.. \n\n\nSpending a night outside the Louvre\
  \ Museum with an Australian friend that I met on the bus from Brussels to Paris.\
  \ We found out that we were on the same situation because of the delayed bus: we\
  \ lost our check-in time to our hosting place so we had to wait a lot to get there.\
  \ So, we listened to music, talked, share a sandwich and drank beer while we walked\
  \ from the bus station to the center, and the best of all, we were our own tourists\
  \ guides, speaking poor french and describing the buildings and landscapes that\
  \ we saw. An unexpected view of a nocturnal Paris, when lights start to turn off,\
  \ a calm city interrupted sometimes by people partying, and the smell of 24/7 cafeterias\
  \ waiting for night travelers. \n\nMonths later\u2026 I discovered myself laying\
  \ down over the sand from the Sahara desert, so fresh and so soft at night. Looking\
  \ at the sky and figure it out every star, you can see the sky as never see it anywhere\
  \ else, it\u2019s pure, it\u2019s just the sky\u2026without buildings, without any\
  \ artificial light. Inmense. \n\nMe, a costarrican girl in the middle of a northern\
  \ African paradise. \nWe danced through the sound of the drums, and the fire lights\
  \ were the witnesses of a night full of laughs, accents and the same souls. Because\
  \ no matter the context, the country\u2026 we are humans, and laughter it\u2019\
  s a same language. \n\nFor me travel is about this, it\u2019s not follow an exhausting\
  \ and rigid itinerary, or going to the popular places with best wi-fi and a 5star\
  \ qualification. It\u2019s about visiting the special places, talking with the people\
  \ from there and feel the hospitality that makes me believe in a better world. A\
  \ world where women of my context were taught to never travel alone because of the\
  \ danger, I\u2019m my own proof that we can make it, and the amount of experiences,\
  \ places and connections are invaluable.\n\nNow, here I am, in New York, in front\
  \ of giant buildings on a city that never stops, where you can find everything.\
  \ It\u2019s very cold and you can see the snow becoming brown at the street because\
  \ the steps of people are endless. \nSitting at the popular Bryant Park, looking\
  \ at so many people around, I wonder, If we add together all the places we have\
  \ visited would we have traveled every place the world? Definitely yes.\n\nIt\u2019\
  s crazy how many countries fit in a suitcase."
