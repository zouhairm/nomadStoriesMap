Text: "Everything started in Novembre 2017 when I was sure I wanted to do Erasmus\
  \ but I did not exactly where. After a long deliberation I decided to apply to Oslo\
  \ University as my first option, being quite sure I was going to be accepted by\
  \ them. Just in case, I applied for other universities all around in Europe to be\
  \ sure I could spend one year abroad. In my list I had such a different countries\
  \ as Belgum, Italy, Portugal and England. \n\nFinally, a mid-Febrary they replied\
  \ me and surprisingly for me I was not accepted in any of my destinations! After\
  \ some tears fell, I decided it may was a good option to wait for the following\
  \ year so, I continued with my regular life, in my regular city, with my regular\
  \ friends. \nHowever, suddely; one week later I recived an e-mail: The girl that\
  \ had Oslo as a destination decided to reject it! In that moment I could not believe\
  \ it, I was going to spend a year in such amazing country as it is Norway, such\
  \ a different country to mine, Spain!! So, I prepared everything and in mid-Augus\
  \ I was packing my stuffs and traveling to Oslo.\n\nThe fist impresion was great,\
  \ everything was so green and the people were so nice to me. The fisrt day I visited\
  \ alone the city waiting for the beginning of the classes to meet new people and;\
  \ the third day, just playing a silly game with international people I met the girl\
  \ that, I did not in that moment but she was going to be my best friend and my big\
  \ support during that year. And everything started.\nI study biology so, I took\
  \ different courses related to physiology, classification and ecology. During my\
  \ first semestre I traveled all around Norway and the north of Italy due to a close\
  \ friend was there studing too and, do not talk about the parties that we organise\
  \ at the student village; they were amazing and there people were even better. \n\
  The frist semestre finished and I came back home for Christmas waiting for the next\
  \ semestre to continue with my adventure. \n\nSudendlly I was again in Oslo, meeting\
  \ new people due to the majority of my frinds have been gone home. Everything looked\
  \ a normal Erasmus until, one evening; my best friend -we will call her Cristina-\
  \ told me she was going to take a course about plants and, the fild trip of that\
  \ course was going to be in Kenya, KENYA!  It has been always my dream go to Africa\
  \ and, if it was to study biology better impossible! So, without thinking it too\
  \ much I signed up for the course and prepared my self for the best trip of my life.\n\
  \nThe field trip was in Taita Hills, mountains located in south-eastern Kenya. We\
  \ were housed in  Helsinki University Research Station, and during ten days we traveled\
  \ all around to study different environments, the sabana, grassland, eucalyptus\
  \ forest, cloud forest, baobabs land\u2026 Everything was great. During this trip\
  \ we were just three spanish and the rest were norwagians and people from Kenyata\
  \ University; the cultural exchange was the best of the trip, I had the opportunity\
  \ to know the norwegians better and to make close frinds, with who I stay in touch\
  \ one year later. \n\nRelated to the people from Kenya was even better, the culture\
  \ is complete different and, although at the beginning was hard to understand them,\
  \ after few days we had such a good relationship. The proffesors also of Kenyata\
  \ University were amazing I could not believe there knowlege about the amount of\
  \ plants that they have there, we even could describe a new specie of plant!\n\n\
  That was the best trip of my life so far and after that, I came back home with more\
  \ knowlege, more friends from all around the world and with more energy to continue\
  \ discovering the wonderful world where I life."
