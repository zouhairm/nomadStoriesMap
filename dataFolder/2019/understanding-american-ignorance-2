Text: "Isolation and internal judgements race through my head as I listen to my friends\
  \ speaking Bulgarian. I am consumed by the need to catch their cues and follow along.\
  \ When they smile, I smile. When they laugh, I laugh. Deep in my mind, I wonder\
  \ if they think I am stupid for not grasping anything they are saying. My eyes wander\
  \ around the historical Serbian kafana desperately searching for anything I can\
  \ relate to. Pictures of traditional clothing and dance hang from the walls reminding\
  \ me of a culture I will never have. Loud screams snap me back into the conversation.\
  \ My gaze lands on Tedi. Her long, blonde hair whips back and forth as she translates\
  \ pieces of the story to me while yelling at her friends to speak English. I sip\
  \ my beer and nod to ease her tension. For the first time among my Bulgarian friends,\
  \ I feel powerless. My role as their guide who helped them navigate their first\
  \ summer in America has been reversed to me looking to them for every piece of guidance.\
  \ \n       Tedi\u2019s battle between her and her friends to use English is familiar.\
  \ I am brought back to a Bulgarian birthday party from the summer. I was invited\
  \ to the celebration out of gratitude for the help I gave them. Tedi chastised her\
  \ friends at the first sign of a few Bulgarian whisperings, and English was spoken\
  \ all night in a group with only two Americans. This was the first time they ever\
  \ invited me to go out with them at night. Until visiting Belgrade, I never understood\
  \ why. The anxiety they experienced trying to speak and follow English from early\
  \ morning until the sun went down was too much for them. The exhaustion. The pretending.\
  \ The loneliness. They felt this each day. But English was expected of them. Bulgarian\
  \ was never expected of me. I realized Tedi\u2019s English fluency forced her to\
  \ represent her friends as a kind of survival. If she did not, they were taken advantage\
  \ of by our boss who already gave them long work days with no breaks and a small,\
  \ dirty room to live in. \n       In America, if immigrants cannot advocate for\
  \ themselves they are perceived as ignorant and dumb. If they can, and their English\
  \ is broken, they are still made fun of. I have never been to a city where I cannot\
  \ communicate in my native language. I have been welcomed by people trying their\
  \ best to string together phrases of English they were forced to learn out of necessity.\
  \ Each person who speaks English to me already mastered their own language and are\
  \ on their second. Most Americans stop at one. Before going to visit my friends,\
  \ I barely learned how to say hello in their language while Tedi taught her six-year-old\
  \ sister how to greet me, and ask how I was.\n       This double standard became\
  \ drastically apparent to me after my trip to Belgrade and our time spent in the\
  \ kafanas. In transitioning from being a leader to grasping onto every translation\
  \ Tedi made for me, I realized their isolation and exhaustion ran deeper than I\
  \ could ever understand because of the negative treatment towards immigrants in\
  \ America. I recognized the laughs and empty eye contact I made as a way to connect\
  \ in Serbia from their faces hundreds of times before. But the best I could do for\
  \ them was withhold judgement while they adapted to me in my country and in theirs.\
  \ \n       Even at the bar in Bulgaria songs were dedicated to \u201Cthe American\
  \ visiting,\u201D and I was treated like family. In America, my coworkers asked\
  \ if they had electricity \u201Cwhere they were from.\u201D The ignorance my American\
  \ friends placed on them was theirs to claim. Innately, Americans disguise their\
  \ lack of knowledge as pride in a showing of ethnocentrism. This \u201Cpride\u201D\
  \ is overwhelmingly used as fuel for shaming those who do not fit into the mold\
  \ of American culture. There is a resounding dismissal of acceptance among Americans\
  \ when they are at a disadvantage or faced with tolerating difference. Lost and\
  \ alone in a sea of my friends words, I began to understand I am oftentimes the\
  \ ignorant one."
