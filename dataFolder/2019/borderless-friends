Text: "As I embarked on my journeys through Europe, Asia, South America and many parts\
  \ of the world, I never had an interest concerning the cultures or people of our\
  \ neighboring country just south of the border. Growing up in Southern California,\
  \ I've had many friends of Latino descent, but we were always taught the dangers\
  \ and impoverished conditions of Mexico that my wanderlust heart never had a desire\
  \ to cross the border...until now.\n\nMy first trip into Mexico as an adult was\
  \ with a friend from San Diego who was celebrating her college graduation in Cabo\
  \ San Lucas with a handful of her closest friends. I fully understood that Cabo\
  \ was just one of those resort towns full of American cultures to fit the needs\
  \ of its visitors. But my 4-day adventure in Cabo not only ended with extraordinary\
  \ memories  I will cherish forever but also my desire to continuously return back\
  \ and explore various parts that Mexico has to offer. \n\nShortly after the Cabo\
  \ trip, my boyfriend and I decided on a last minute road trip down to Rosarito,\
  \ just 45 minutes south of the border. We found an amazing beachfront home on Airbnb\
  \ and booked two rooms, one for us and one for two friends of ours that we convinced\
  \ to drive down with us. Our Airbnb host greeted us with some delectable snacks\
  \ of chips and salsa and freshly made margaritas, cerveza (that's beer in Spanish),\
  \ and some delicious red wine. This is when we learned that Mexico has its own wine\
  \ country which happens to produce this bottle of red blend we were sipping on from\
  \ Santo Tomas, one of the oldest wineries in Mexico! Who knew! As a wanna-be wine\
  \ connoisseur, I was determined to find out more about this hidden secret that Mexico\
  \ seems to be holding out on. So a couple of months later, we found yet another\
  \ gem, a rustic yet charming bed and breakfast in Valle de Guadalupe, Mexico's wine\
  \ country, to see what new discoveries we would stumble upon this time. This particular\
  \ trip was to celebrate the anniversary of my now husband and I's 3 years of dating,\
  \ so we wanted something that was off the beaten path yet easy to influence our\
  \ friends and families to visit if we ended up enjoying our time, which of course,\
  \ we did! Not only did we enjoyed our romantic getaway, but we also left with unexpected\
  \ friendships that have since flourished into a family.\n\nThe bed and breakfast\
  \ was run by Arturo, an Ensenada local whose family was well known in the community.\
  \ Due to the booming wine business in the Valle, the family decided to turn their\
  \ vacation home into a bed and breakfast. Arturo and the men who help him run the\
  \ business created an extraordinary friendship with us that weekend, they insisted\
  \ we come back and stay at their own personal residence in Ensenada where they have\
  \ treated us as their own family numerous times by allowing us to stay free of charge\
  \ and took us on adventures throughout the city.  \n\nSince meeting Arturo and his\
  \ amazing circle of friends in Ensenada, we have had the honor of hosting our wedding\
  \ on his property where 50 of our closest friends were treated to an unexpected\
  \ 4 days of unparalleled celebration! Their uttered amazement at the beauty of Valle\
  \ de Guadalupe and the incredible hospitality from our new Mexican friends was exactly\
  \ what I wanted them to experience. Even those who were apprehensive about going\
  \ into Mexico but reluctantly accepted our wedding invitation had a change of heart\
  \ after the amazing nuptials. \n\nOur Mexican cultural exploration continued years\
  \ after that as we fearlessly tasted different varieties of mole in the city of\
  \ Puebla, learned the manufacturing process of tequila in the state of Jalisco,\
  \ divulge in one of the top 50 restaurants of Latin America in the city of Monterrey,\
  \ ringing in the New Year with thousands of people dancing and singing at Monumento\
  \ a la Independencia in Mexico City, and fell in love again at the most romantic\
  \ city in Mexico sharing a kiss at Callej\xF3n del Beso in Guanajuato. Our endless\
  \ pursuit to discover Mexico will continue."
