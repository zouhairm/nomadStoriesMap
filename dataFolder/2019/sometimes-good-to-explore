Text: "In 2016 , I went to Australia for a vacation. I fell in love with that country.\
  \ It have all the things which I want to explore like beaches , adventure , food\
  \ etc.\nIt was my first time , when I visited a foreign country . I was very excited\
  \ about that , my parents were also there with me to help me and guide me. Because\
  \ it was a place which is unfamiliar for me. Over there I visited Sydney, Melbourne,\
  \ Perth.\nIn Sydney I saw and done many new things for the first time in my life\
  \ example:swimming with dolphins , different types of sharks,and some sea creatures\
  \ in aquarium . It was a pleasure encounter with them . The darling harbour is full\
  \ of people and lights and it becomes alive in the night , when artists start showcasing\
  \ their talents through different medium like dancing, acting, magic shows , food\
  \ . madam Tussaud\u2019s museum is the place where Bollywood and Hollywood stars\
  \ wax statue are kept for the visitors. So that everyone can know about both the\
  \ stars and what they have done . There are many props of marvel movies and cartoons\
  \ characters for the children. They do provide drinks and snacks for visitors.\n\
  I was there for about a week but I feel like home due to nice weather condition\
  \ at that time and the festival going on in the city. And then I went to Melbourne\
  \ by train because it was the cheapest way of transportation. I face many problems\
  \ during my train ride . But when I reach their I forgot everything and just gazing\
  \ at the scenario. Their are mountains on the one side and sea on the other hand\
  \ in between both their was a road on which we are going. I saw three weather a\
  \ day like sunshine in the morning, rainy or  cloudy in the evening, and cold in\
  \ the night. Over there I explore places on helicopter to see the beauty of nature\
  \ , like twelve Apostles, sea link bridge, outlets for brands  . Rome  on trams\
  \ , for aquarium, museum,markets, famous places where Bollywood films made etc .\
  \ I stayed at my uncle\u2019s house so that we can save some amount for doing expensive\
  \ adventures. I had done bungee jumping, parasailing, paragliding and cruise ride\
  \ . \nWhich was not my cup of tea without having lots and lots of money due to not\
  \ doing anything in India because of studies and also I was not major at that time\
  \ to do any job . Just a girl who use to like visiting but on his dad\u2019s money.\
  \ They are the one who treated  me as a princess at that time also and today also\
  \ . \nAfter all that ,  I went to Perth in flight because it was a long journey\
  \ and time consuming. Over there my cousin uncle live so he can help me with all\
  \ the staying , food and roming. He gathered all the information about what to do\
  \ in a week so that we can have a rough idea about that accordingly can plan things\
  \ . My relatives also lives there so that we can have a one course meal with them\
  \ and spent some time together for knowing them and how hard was the life when they\
  \ first came to Australia. The job opportunities for the newly came or the freshers.\
  \ I got to know that if a person is well educated than he /she can do anything in\
  \ any country along with that , the skills and nature plays an important role.\n\
  Wherever you go your dreams are going to follow you so keep trying for achieving\
  \ it . About Perth , I miss those sunny days and that walking on sea shores will\
  \ coffee and chips , enjoying sea food in pubs and grills , hand toasted pizza ,\
  \ and the night life dancing on dj\u2019s , going to concerts etc . And the tracking\
  \ in jungle to see the waterfall  , kangaroos and koalas. It feels like heaven in\
  \ on the Mother Earth.\nAll in all , these are the things which I remembered have\
  \ done during whole Australian journey of just 25 days . I want to explore more\
  \ and more countries and as much as I can travel and learn new things about that\
  \ places and capturing them for memories."
