Text: "You know that feeling, where you feel as though you have just received the\
  \ warmest hug in the whole world, where your soul feels full, where every part of\
  \ you feels warmed, where you want for nothing, where you feel as though you might\
  \ just live forever.\n\LThere is something special, something to be said for when\
  \ someone makes you a homecooked meal, that you don't make yourself - it just tastes\
  \ better. The same goes for when someone picks you fresh vegetables from their garden\
  \ - they just taste better than your own. It is filled with their love. \n\nThis\
  \ is community.  And here, in Italy, is where you find the secrets to living as\
  \ a part of a community. It is the home of cooking, living and nurturing! \n\nTime\
  \ and time again, the importance of community has been proven to be beyond the importance\
  \ of mostly everything else. Traditionally, the village, or community, was at the\
  \ core of human experience. Eating was together, celebrating was together, growing\
  \ and gathering was together, and nurturing was together. And it has been seen to\
  \ lead to longevity, above so many other lifestyle factors.\n\nIn our modern world\
  \ we have lost so many secrets to \u201Cliving well\u201D and the experience of\
  \ community. The busyness of life takes over, and tradition falls away. \n\nSo,\
  \ we are here. \n\nI have read so much about such traditional villages, these places\
  \ in Italy that have the highest rates of longevity. What are the simple secrets?\
  \ What magical things make you live forever?  \n\nI focused on visiting \u201Cblue\
  \ zones\u201D of Italy, staying for a length of time in 4 villages that are considered\
  \ to have some of the longest living populations in the world. Each place, was different\
  \ in so many ways. But they all had similarities. The people always seemed so young,\
  \ their skin young, their cheeks plump, and they laughed out loud, as if they have\
  \ never laughed before. There was a kindness, a care, that I felt like I had been\
  \ missing in my life, like a big cuddle. They were generally upfront and said what\
  \ they meant and meant what they said. And most of all, everything was centred around\
  \ their village, wherever it was that they lived - their friends, the way they ate,\
  \ what they ate, the things they did - seldom did they leave the village and seldom\
  \ did they do anything alone. Actually, I laugh as I remember a time this surprised\
  \ us (as it often did, because it\u2019s not something we are used to), as I asked\
  \ a local woman if she could take us to see something - she said yes, and as always,\
  \ she arrived with 4 other people, her cousin and her cousins wife and a friend,\
  \ and we all climbed into a tiny car. It is always like this. There are always more\
  \ people somewhere then you thought there would be, everyone is always invited.\n\
  \nAt the time, I noted in amongst my observations that obviously I couldn\u2019\
  t account for the impact genetics has on these people. Maybe they just had amazing\
  \ genetics that made their skin taught and life jovial. But after further research\
  \ I now see that life meaning and community outweighs any other factor for longevity,\
  \ so much more than genetics. So these observations stand alone, they tell you about\
  \ what things lead to meaning for these traditional villages - for these people\
  \ who live for a long time. They are here to learn from, so we can apply these things\
  \ to our lives, to give it meaning. \n[Insert list of observations here]\n\nSo,\
  \ the secret is, there is no secret. Food is definitely a key factor. It\u2019s\
  \ local, it\u2019s usually traditional and made from whole, natural ingredients.\
  \ But it is also beyond that, it is more than that - it is about sharing that food,\
  \ it\u2019s about meaning, it\u2019s about community, it\u2019s the village. \n\n\
  But above all else it is just about the simple life, the one right in front of you\
  \ - you just have to reach out and grab it. And, as discussed, it\u2019s all about\
  \ creating life meaning, through connectedness. Through community."
