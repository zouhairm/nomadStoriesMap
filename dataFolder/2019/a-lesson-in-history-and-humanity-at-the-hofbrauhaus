Text: "We were five Americans who, on paper, couldn\u2019t have had less in common.\
  \ A working-class, African-American father-son duo with a background in aviation;\
  \ a retired, affluent couple with cheeks still rosy from their week on the Swiss\
  \ Alps; and me, a 20-something single female in the midst of a soul-searching solo\
  \ adventure.\n\nWe met under the most unlikely of terms on a three-hour tour of\
  \ the rise of the Third Reich. And though we hailed from all parts of the United\
  \ States, we found ourselves clustered together on the streets of a city which was\
  \ one of the most influential in the unraveling of events in the 20th century.\n\
  \nAs we stood beneath the painted ceiling of the banquet hall of the Hofbr\xE4uhaus,\
  \ we tried to take in the enormity of the room, as well as the events that transpired\
  \ there. And although the rising tensions in our own country is a comparison not\
  \ lost on us, there was an overwhelming sense of unity, rather than division, in\
  \ this peak into a dark past during a time not all that long ago.\n\nAt the end\
  \ of the tour, we shared stories and coffee, realizing we had more in common than\
  \ originally appeared on the surface. Though it is unlikely our paths would have\
  \ crossed throughout the course of our daily lives, we learned that our narratives\
  \ were intertwined.\n\nThe retired university vice president explained to me that\
  \ he, too, wanted to take off on a solo adventure after graduating college, but\
  \ held a low draft number and would soon enter the very war that gained its momentum\
  \ on the cobblestone streets where we walked. The working-class father was an Air\
  \ Force mechanic who worked on the planes that would nearly level the city we gazed\
  \ upon. And me, I am the granddaughter of a World War II veteran who flew in the\
  \ Air Force above the skies where we stood.\n\nWe shared a bond not because we were\
  \ all Americans, but because we are all people living separate lives yet trying\
  \ to understand the course of history and how we are inexplicably connected in it,\
  \ now more than ever."
