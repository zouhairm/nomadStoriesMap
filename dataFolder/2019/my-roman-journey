Text: "As a toddler who loved to peer on Atlas maps while listening to news, the fantasy\
  \ of International travel was birthed in me unconsciously by my parents. My mum\
  \ being a High School Social Studies Teacher had a library of maps and social studies\
  \ text books which I loved to read during my leisure time right from primary school,\
  \ and my dad loved to listen to the Voice of America on his Shortwave band radio.\
  \ It was no wonder that I ended up combining both parental nuances to form my personal\
  \ character. I had my first International experience while in University and it\
  \ was chaperoned. However, I longed for a solo travel experience to far-flunged\
  \ lands and that I engineered via my passion for Model United Nations Conferences.\n\
  To fulfill my solo International travel dream in 2016, I entered as a participant\
  \ to the Harvard World Model United Nations. Usually held at different select cities\
  \ around the world annually, in 2016, it was held in Rome. The choice of Rome as\
  \ host city for the event in 2016 whetted my appetite to attend. As an Architect,\
  \ History and Heritage enthusiast, Rome is special as being the cradle of the Architectural\
  \ Renaissance and the headquarters of the Catholic Church.\nI proceeded to apply\
  \ for the conference which my selection was confirmed and from thence, it was a\
  \ leap into the unknown. I had to arrange my itinerary after obtaining my visa which\
  \ was came with its hassles.\nI hooked up with co-attendees via conference buddies\
  \ facebook group page and was able to secure accommodation pair mates. My Roman\
  \ experience began upon my arrival at Fiumicino airport on 12th March 2016, which\
  \ happened to be my first time in Europe. I took an airport taxi to Sheraton Parco\
  \ de Medici to hook up with my flat mates who took me to our accommodation at Villa\
  \ Bonelli. We were meeting for the first time and it was a weird experience for\
  \ me. I had as accommodation pairs an Iranian, 2 Philipinas, and a Bangladeshi.\
  \ I shared my bed with a Philipino who was the only male aside me, while the ladies\
  \ occupied the other room. The accommodation was a two bedroom service apartment\
  \ with Wi-Fi and it was close to the train station. I found my flat mates very wonderful\
  \ as we happily juggled domestic chores.\nThough the conference was held at Sheraton\
  \ Parco de Medici, other Conference side events were held across the city of Rome.\
  \ I had a naivet\xE9 for relying on city maps but my Iranian flat mate was always\
  \ handy whenever I got lost. Most times we moved to and fro the conference proceedings\
  \ together.\nThere was a scheduled audience with the Pope during the Conference\
  \ and that took place at Pope Paul VI Audience Hall at the Vatican. That afforded\
  \ moments to explore the Vatican Museum, Saint Peter\u2019s Basilica and though\
  \ I could not reach the Sistine Chapel, the Renaissance Architecture on display\
  \ was profound. \nAfterwards we hiked to the Roman Forum. It was a thrilling experience\
  \ as about 5000 young people from over 100 countries took the walk with their National\
  \ flags draped around their necks. At some points some of us missed the hike train\
  \ as we were shopping around for souvenirs but the City bus was handy to save our\
  \ blushes. \nThe ruins of the Roman forum was the ultimate experience of my Roman\
  \ journey. I had an awesome feel of the Coliseum, the arch of Titus and other ruins\
  \ of the Roman Empire.\nMy loathsome naivete for the city maps played a hard one\
  \ on me as I missed my flight by a few minutes after missing my way en-route the\
  \ airport. Though posing another challenge I sought more adventure by rescheduling\
  \ my return trip via Qatar. With no time to explore that gulf City state, the airport\
  \ and its precincts gave a satisfactory assurance of the preparedness of that Country\
  \ to host the 2022 World Cup.\nI arrived Lagos 23rd March exhausted but timelessly\
  \ fulfilled at my first solo intercontinental travel and the experiences garnered\
  \ from it formed a guiding template as my travel advisory for subsequent International\
  \ trips."
