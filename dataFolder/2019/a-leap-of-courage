Text: After finishing University with a psych degree, I knew I had to explore the
  world instead of going for a Master's. Where do I start, though? My boss at the
  time was a North Korean refugee that had built a life in Canada and had questioned
  me about my plans one afternoon. I had no idea what I was going to do, and told
  him so; he became excited and planted the idea of teaching English in Korea. Intrigued,
  I went home and researched. Lo and behold, the possibility to travel, make money,
  and experience life and new cultures; I was sold. I obtained a TEFL certification
  and was soon on my way to South Korea. I went knowing no one but my recruiter, but
  knowing that this was the only path for me; the only path towards independence and
  growth, not only personally, but professionally, spiritually, and increased my knowledge
  as well as my compassion. I am so thankful that I had the courage and independence
  to go through with my decision to go overseas; it was eye opening, mind blowing
  and heart magnifying. I met some of my most precious friends there, whom I am still
  in contact with and still have a purposeful connection with. It was an amazing opportunity
  that has impacted my life and perspective and I will always look back with fondness
  for the experiences I had over there.
