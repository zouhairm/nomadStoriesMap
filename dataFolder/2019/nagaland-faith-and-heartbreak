Text: "\u201CRemember how we drove through a war zone, Yakov?\u201D Sam asks after\
  \ a grueling eight-hour ride to Longwa, Nagaland. I laugh. We didn\u2019t. We only\
  \ scared ourselves into thinking we had.\nEarlier that day we started our drive\
  \ into Nagaland. The \u201Cwe\u201D in question was photographer Trupal, filmmaker\
  \ Sam, and me, an accountant attempting travel blogging. We were going to meet the\
  \ last Konyak headhunters and document their culture in a short film, series of\
  \ photographs and article.\nWe had met the previous summer in Ethiopia. A few months\
  \ later Trupal suggested this project and I was sold instantly. After seeing his\
  \ Konyak portraits, it was too tempting to pass up.\nSo two months later, in a car\
  \ bound for Nagaland, Trupal asked: \u201CDo you guys know about Naxalites?\u201D\
  \ We didn\u2019t. \u201CThey\u2019re fighting for independence from India\u2026\
  \ They don\u2019t attack tourists, only the government.\u201D This was news to us.\
  \ \u201CWe will be OK, but I prefer to reach Longwa before dark.\u201D Sam seemed\
  \ unconcerned. \u201CTrupal, can you repeat that on camera?\u201D \nWe crossed into\
  \ Nagaland in darkness, hours from our destination. As we wound up steep hills,\
  \ armed bandits disguised as trees and bushes rose from the shadows at every turn,\
  \ then disappeared. Sam was quiet. Our driver decided to comfort us. \u201CThe rebels\
  \ rarely attack tourists\u201D, he volunteered. \u201CYou\u2019re staying at Longshaw\u2019\
  s. His uncle is a Naxalite leader\u201D.  \nNext morning we walk around Longwa,\
  \ a village of 7,000 nestled in the hills and divided by the India-Myanmar border.\
  \ There are no border guards, just a couple of marker stones. We meet the king,\
  \ who rules it and some 30 nearby villages. The king\u2019s house is the second\
  \ largest building in Longwa after the Baptist church. It straddles the border,\
  \ so they say he eats in India and sleeps in Myanmar.\nWhen the British came to\
  \ colonize India they found a fearsome, yet industrious and self-sufficient warrior\
  \ nation in these hills. The Konyak, a local tribe, made their own clothes, food,\
  \ medicine, weapons and even gunpowder. They were fierce fighters with a tradition\
  \ of taking the enemy\u2019s head to prove a kill. Enemy skulls were proudly displayed\
  \ in their homes. The headhunters had their faces tattooed to mark their first kill,\
  \ earning their pick of wives and privileged position in society. \nInstead of fighting,\
  \ the British gave out opium. And opium colonized Nagaland. It consumes an addict\u2019\
  s life, an hour at a time. That\u2019s what it takes to prepare and smoke an opium\
  \ pipe. Someone feeding their addiction has no time for war. Or much else.\nIn the\
  \ 1960s some brave Baptist missionaries converted the Konyak to Christianity and\
  \ the headhunting stopped. The last headhunters are now old men, the youngest in\
  \ his sixties. The first one we meet tells us how he buried his victims\u2019 skulls\
  \ and prays for forgiveness at the graves. \u201CWe killed a few and always for\
  \ a reason. You kill by the thousand without one\u201D he says. \nWe spend a week\
  \ meeting the headhunters, observing their lives. We watch the community build a\
  \ house. We see women working the fields, gathering firewood, cooking, raising children,\
  \ but never smoking opium. We befriend our two helpers. Angu and Chinshaw are in\
  \ their twenties, uneducated. Both sell souvenirs to tourists and smuggle opium\
  \ from Myanmar.  \n\u201CI was 15, fell sick and they gave it to me as medicine.\u201D\
  \ Chinshaw says, his father filling the opium pipe next to him. \u201CI would like\
  \ to do something else\u201D. I ask what. \u201CServe in the army\u201D. Unsure,\
  \ half-hearted. Angu laughs the question off. \u201CNothing. Opium is good.\u201D\
  \nNone of India\u2019s development is apparent here. There are few schools, no college\
  \ or university, the infrastructure is poor, healthcare almost nonexistent.\n\u201C\
  If you ever get independence, who will fix your roads or power lines? You don\u2019\
  t have an educated workforce. How will you pay for the help you need?\u201D I ask\
  \ our host.\nLongshaw considers this. \u201CWe have oil\u2026.\u201D I think of\
  \ this as we drive back. Can the Naga find the wisdom and good governance to exploit\
  \ their natural resources to the benefit of more than a few?\n\u201CRemember how\
  \ we drove through a war zone, Yakov?\u201D \nVividly. We are still losing."
