Text: "Women smiled as children emerged from their huts. Word was out, a white girl\
  \ was visiting. I felt a sense of joy seeing their beautiful dark faces. All I could\
  \ do in return was share my biggest smile and say \u201CJambo!\u201D with all my\
  \ heart. Every now and then I\u2019d hear \u201CKaribu!\" Which means welcome. I\
  \ loved the Swahili greeting. The children giggled at my pronunciation and I didn\u2019\
  t care. \u201CJambo!\u201D I said again and again to anyone who looked at me.\n\n\
  This was my first time in Mombasa, Kenya and the greater African continent. I had\
  \ never travelled to anywhere like Mombasa before yet this feeling was saying welcome\
  \ home to my soul. There was nothing in my ancestry that would connect me to Africa\
  \ but yet here I was, feeling a deep connection to this land with potential new\
  \ friends surrounding me. It was hard to describe but my physical discomfort from\
  \ the heat and stinging sun outweighed the joy of my spirit. \n\nMy senses heightened\
  \ as I continued observing my surroundings while navigating twists and turns around\
  \ tiny wood shacks and baobab trees. A man on the side of the street was making\
  \ cassava crisps, called \"Muhogo\". They sizzled in a large frying pan. The cook\
  \ smiled offering a taste. Scooping several out of the fryer, he soaked up the oil\
  \ with a paper towel and dusted the fried chips with cayenne, salt, and a squeeze\
  \ of lemon. I tentatively put them into my mouth, receive a flavour explosion as\
  \ I started to chew them with joy. They were perfectly crisp with a slightly sweet\
  \ centre.  I smiled towards the cook and said \u201CAsante\u201D meaning thank you.\
  \ I could tell the cook was pleased as he offered me more. I purchased two packets\
  \ wrapped in plastic bags. \n\nI finally arrived at the orphanage to volunteer.\
  \ A little girl dressed in a dirty floral shift that was two sizes too big was standing\
  \ inside the front gates. She was dishevelled and messy but her eyes shined so bright,\
  \ they almost sparkled. I fell for her immediately as my maternal instincts took\
  \ over. Her face was as black as night and her wiry short dark hair lay tight on\
  \ her head. She motioned for me to follow her and we walked together in silence\
  \ through into the orphanage that was filled with children. A lady met us at the\
  \ front door and said hello, introducing herself as Ava, the owner. She said, \u201C\
  This is Alice. She likes to greet everyone who visits.\" I crouched down to face\
  \ Alice and said, \u201CJambo Alice, my name is Janine. I am so happy to meet you.\u201D\
  \ Alice smiled, her eyes sparkled. I gave the bags filled with Muhogo to Ava who\
  \ smiled with thanks.\n\nI spent the day playing with the children and helping out\
  \ with chores around the centre. Alice was always nearby. She would often talk to\
  \ me in her native language. She pointed to her dress. On the front was a purple\
  \ and pink butterfly surrounded by colourful flowers. I said \"Alice you are a beautiful\
  \ butterfly, just like this.\" Pointing at her dress and taping her nose, which\
  \ made her smile and giggle with delight. We danced around as butterflies and other\
  \ kids joined us.\n\nMy time at the orphanage was incredibly special because of\
  \ Alice. Leaving Alice was hard. I wrote her a card and drew a butterfly on the\
  \ front. I wrote: \u201CAsante Alice. I will never forget you. You are a beautiful\
  \ butterfly.\u201D\n\nI remember Alice to this day. I often wonder how life turned\
  \ out for her. She was a beautiful butterfly, an angel, and I will always have a\
  \ place for her in my heart."
