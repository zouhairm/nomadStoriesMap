Text: "It was the first day, I was a foreigner in a city also known as an \u201Coasis\u201D\
  , it was not an imaginary city. I did not know anybody there but I have just followed\
  \ my instincts. I felt as if I was at home, a member of that family.\nLet me talk\
  \ about this beautiful place, about its population, the language, customs and tradition\
  \ and finally the handiwork.\n\nFirst of all, the inhabitants are an ethnic group\
  \ that is called Amazighs (or Berbers). These tribes are from Ifriqiya, Europe or\
  \ East Africa\nSiwa is located in the core of the desert, nevertheless, there is\
  \ a lot of spring of water like the Cleopatra bath (also known as Cleopatra\u2019\
  s eye), First eye, Fifth eye,\u2026 There are also salt lakes. I don\u2019t how\
  \ to describe the pureness of these landscape, it is like a paradise in the heart\
  \ of the desert. \n\nIn addition to that, Siwa is an antique city. There is the\
  \ mount of Dead (Gabal al Mawta), this mountain contains tombs that dates about\
  \ the 3rd century BC, as the tombs of Si-Amun. There are also other archaeological\
  \ sites as Dakrur Mountain, Amoun temple, Alexander the great temple, Shaly fortress\
  \ and many others historical treasures. \n\nOn top of that, Siwa is in the middle\
  \ of the Western Desert, it has the golden and the soft sand. It is the best place\
  \ for the medical tourism. The bath of sand helps to cure rheumatism, rheumatoid\
  \ joint pain, \u2026\n\nSiwa is also famous for the handiwork made by the women\
  \ of this magical city. They make beautiful clothes; for the weeding, for everyday,\
  \ \u2026 They also fabricate carpets, curtains,\u2026 They were clothes that I have\
  \ never seen thus far. When the women go outside, they all wear the same cloth that\
  \ is called \u201CTarfoutet\u201D which means \u201Ccoating\u201D.\n\nI also have\
  \ eaten delicious meal but weird at the same time. The Siwan food has its speciality,\
  \ the most famous are : \u201CAl Makhmakh\u201D, \u201CAl Salig\u201D and many other\
  \ dishes.\n\nThis place is amazing that even the prince Charles and his wife has\
  \ visited it. Siwa is in the top ten place for the isolation. If you want to relax,\
  \ be peaceful and discover a new culture I really recommend you to visit Siwa."
