Text: "I awake to the rustle of fabric and flashing lights darting behind closed eyelids.\
  \ Stretching out weary limbs, I slip out of my sleep sheet, knowing that to linger\
  \ in my cocoon of warmth will only lead to a more strenuous day. In the bed below\
  \ I can hear my mother shifting about, her slightest movements jostling the bunks,\
  \ causing them to sway like boats at sea. I, and all around me, begin to fall into\
  \ well-worn morning routines. Change quickly in darkness and pack up rucksacks with\
  \ scallop shells tied to the front. I move silently between bunks of still sleeping\
  \ bodies and thread around people packing up. We tug on shoes left on shelves, a\
  \ jumble of boots, runners and worn laces. I catch eyes with my mother and we both\
  \ slip through the darkened doorway and into the night. \nMy joints creak in the\
  \ cool still air as I switch on my headtorch to illuminate the way ahead. Footsteps\
  \ echo on cobblestones, crunch across stones and patter along sanded dirt tracks.\
  \ Our mornings consist of a soft silence, eyes searching for yellow arrows painted\
  \ on rocks or walls to guide us. Rustles in the tall grasses signify night creatures\
  \ scurrying away, shrouded in dim moonlight and always accompanied by the gentle\
  \ chirp of crickets. Birdsong preludes the first rays of sunshine and around us\
  \ the sky swirls into a symphony of vibrant pinks, pale purples and vivacious oranges.\
  \ Light illuminates our surroundings; rolling green hills, endless fields of startling\
  \ red poppies, vineyards bedecked in still-green grapes and all awash with golden\
  \ light, casting our shadows onto the ground before us. With the rising sun comes\
  \ the first tentative tendrils of heat. It sinks into the ground and gives way to\
  \ the scent of dew and warm earth. We pause to pull off fleeces, tuck away headlamps\
  \ and calculate how many miles to go until a cup of coffee. \nWe stop in the first\
  \ town with open caf\xE9s, white walled and red roofed buildings set against the\
  \ background of a now azure blue sky. In these sleepy Spanish villages sparrows\
  \ spiral around church spires, darting and tumbling through the air. Other times\
  \ it\u2019s a stork\u2019s nest that rests precariously above the church, with the\
  \ great white birds acting as flags for town centers. The cafes are usually crowded\
  \ with other pilgrims, all chattering and sharing tables. Most sit outside and bathe\
  \ in the half-light, some dangling smoking cigarettes in their hands, others pouring\
  \ over guide books and planning the day ahead. We slip in amongst them, setting\
  \ down heavy packs and easing ourselves down onto chairs as people shuffle to make\
  \ room at small round tables. We sip on creamy caf\xE9 con leche, accompanied by\
  \ still-warm flakey croissants or grilled baguette doused in melting butter. Our\
  \ respite is brief for we are always aware of the ever-rising sun and hope to evade\
  \ the stifling beams of the midday sun. We set off once again, amidst shouts of\
  \ \u2018Buen Camino!\u2019 from both other pilgrims and locals alike. Passing through\
  \ the village, wooden shutters open and shopkeepers turn down chairs. Old men, tanned\
  \ a deep brown with wrinkles wizening their faces wave at us as we pass, bags of\
  \ fresh bread dangling on their arms. \nThough always an early-riser, I didn\u2019\
  t expect to derive such joy or tranquility from these early morning hours on the\
  \ Camino de Santiago. A witness to the transition of the world moving from sleeping\
  \ and stillness to awake and beating. Also known as the Camino de Compostela or\
  \ The Way of The Stars, it seems fitting that to walk under these stars in the hours\
  \ before dawn should replenish both the body and mind. When I returned to every-day\
  \ life I carried with me these morning memories and often when I glimpse pink skies\
  \ at dawn or catch a whiff of fresh bread from bakeries in the greys of Dublin city,\
  \ I\u2019m transported back to the North of Spain, with nothing but a bag upon my\
  \ back, the earth beneath my feet and my one prevailing thought of putting one foot\
  \ in front of the other."
