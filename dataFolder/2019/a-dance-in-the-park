Text: "Today was quite diverse in cultural experiences, despite being only my first\
  \ full day in Hai Phong.\nI got up about 9am. Which seems to be fairly early in\
  \ either backpacker or Vietnam world as others slept a lot longer, in Ha Noi shops/cafe\
  \ didn't really open till 10am and closed almost 10pmish (I didnt stay up to check).\n\
  While I was drinking my morning tea on the couch Del and Dan (names anonymised \U0001F605\
  )came commenced a yoga session and I joined in. Del is an Indian girl, lawyer turned\
  \ Yoga instructor. She was very focused on the hips and the emotional history they\
  \ hold (like how stress and anxiety is 'stored' in shoulders). Great class! She's\
  \ so flexible. \n\nDel then gave me a lift around town a bit for veggies and laundry.\
  \  I did some work for 3 hours on social media. As usual taking a lot longer than\
  \ it should \U0001F62B\U0001F92F. Read a little fiction. And had a nap \U0001F605\
  \ Woke up about 3.45 and set out to head to the pool ~6 km/75min walk. A little\
  \  scary as walking along side semi trailers. But in general a nice walk. So far\
  \ I've seen 2 building shaped like boats, including the hospital. Interesting architecture!\
  \ \nAnd some great plant manicures around! Trees trimmed in cloves, Angel's and\
  \ whale tails.\nI eventually got into the usual streets, with smaller traffic and\
  \ more \"shops\".\nBut I never made it to the pool. As I got to the centre I passed\
  \ a park and noticed some ladies exercising.  So again, I joined them. Because experiencing\
  \ other lives is what I am here for. I started with a group of older ladies doing\
  \ pretty low intensity stuff until another group started with some dancing so the\
  \ instructor sent me there way. I received lots of amused smiles and nods, and returned\
  \ them. I suck at dancing and don't usually enjoy it but this was fairly simple\
  \ with mostly lots of arm swinging and hip moving and I copied the instructor the\
  \ whole time. At  the end of the class the instructor had a participant take a photo\
  \ of us, so happy to have a random foreigner join in! So of course I passed them\
  \ my phone as well.  Another instructor commenced a new session but I had to leave\
  \ to pick up my laundry \U0001F605."
