Text: "In early 2016 I had developed the crazy notion of riding my 5 speed peugeot\
  \ city bike to Italy. I was in Paris at the time, and it was clear to everyone that\
  \ it was a mad idea. So I told them I would start by riding to Lyon, and decide\
  \ there if I could make it over the Alps. I built a trailer out of scrap, and was\
  \ nearly ready to go when a snapped crank left me with some cracked ribs and severe\
  \ bruising. I'd need to wait for a bit, and just as well because a professional\
  \ bike guide saw the peugeot and laughed so hard I replaced it with an 80 euro,\
  \ second-hand Decathlon 24 speed. On august 24th 2016 I set a course directly for\
  \ Lyon. This would take me through le parc naturel  r\xE9gional du morvan, this\
  \ would be my first challenge, but if I could ride through those mountains, then\
  \ I could manage the alps.\n I didn't know how far the ride would take me. I knew\
  \ I wouldn't stop in Lyon as I had told my friends, but the route, and the final\
  \ destination, where unplanned; I hoped to make it Rome. Of course I had no idea\
  \ what this would entail, maps are flat. By the end of September I was riding into\
  \ Pompeii and making plans to get back across the mediterranean. \n Leaving Lyon\
  \ I ditched the trailer, placed on a solid front carrier, replaced the tires, and\
  \ half-way up the alps I covered the seat with padding.\n This was an exploration\
  \ of the spaces between the cities of Europe. An investigation of the landscapes\
  \ in which cities, villages, and towns grew. There were long periods of endurance\
  \ and pain, and periods of boredom, but these were always broken by breath-taking\
  \ landscapes, and the appearance of old castles and towns, cathedrals and cities.\n\
  \ Walking into the vestibule of Vezelay Basilique to the sound of a choir, winding\
  \ through the coastal towns after Genoa, pausing in Pisa, watching a medieval fortified\
  \ town emerge in the landscape like some natural formation, seeing the dust rising\
  \ from the quarries at Carrara, stopping in Rome to explore the city, and to be\
  \ walking in the ruins of Pompeii, all of these things combined with the physical\
  \ disciplines of riding, finding a camp, putting up a tent, sleeping, rising at\
  \ dawn, packing down, mapping a route, to put me in the context of the country and\
  \ culture in a way that flying never had.\n By the end of that ride I was in a position\
  \ to understand what it could mean to feel happiness and well-being. We can make\
  \ these spaces in life, and we should take even space as an opportunity. When you\
  \ travel in this way you are in a good position. The daily routine is not accompanied\
  \ by the monotony of an over familiar landscape. The brain does not have an chance\
  \ to shut that window on the world. Every new vista is packed full of detail, and\
  \ when you have a task to perform, like riding a bike, the choice has often to be\
  \ made that this scene is one to remember through direct experience. When you are\
  \ flying down the side of a mountain, and stretched before your eyes is the most\
  \ spectacular landscape you have ever seen, here-in lies an opportunity to experience\
  \ all of life in the here and now. Riding over the col du mont ceni into Italy was\
  \ just such a moment. After three days of nothing but uphill to go from the crest\
  \ of the ranges to the road leading to Turin in less that an hour, with the Italian\
  \ landscape in miniature below you, here is an experience that will embed itself\
  \ in memory of every level."
