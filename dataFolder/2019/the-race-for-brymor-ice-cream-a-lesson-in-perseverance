Text: "Our morning started in the classroom. By early afternoon, we were photographing\
  \ the Fountains Abbey in Ripon, England. Edwin, our group leader had promised that\
  \ we would go to Brymor Dairy in Masham for ice cream afterwards. Signs for Brymor\
  \ ice cream are seen throughout the Yorkshire Dales. \n\nThe plan was to meet at\
  \ the entrance to Fountains Abbey at 5 PM, depart, and make the half hour drive\
  \ over to Brymor before they closed at 6 PM. Then, we would continue on to our dinner\
  \ reservations at the Black Sheep Brewery.\n\nFountains Abbey is owned by the National\
  \ Trust and is the largest monastic ruins in England. The Studley Royal Water Garden\
  \ is also on the property. The grounds are extensive, and as one of my fellow workshop\
  \ participants noted, \u201C\u2026a place like this needs to be absorbed slowly.\u201D\
  \ \n\nA few members of our group got lost on the grounds, and we didn\u2019t all\
  \ re-convene until 5:15 PM. We decided to try and reach Brymor Creamery anyway.\
  \ GPS was telling us it would take approximately 35 minutes to drive the 17 miles.\
  \ The roads in England are narrow and twist, adding an extra layer of challenge,\
  \ and more time to any trip. \n\nAs we set off, I noticed that several occupants\
  \ of the third car were still putting cameras into the trunk. This wasn\u2019t a\
  \ good sign. Edwin, our driver, went as fast as the roads allowed; it was a hair-raising\
  \ ride.\n\nWe drove around a corner and over the crest of a hill and saw a stunning\
  \ landscape view. Oh, if only we had time to stop for a few more photos. While driving\
  \ past the Black Sheep Brewery, Edwin said, \u201CI would stop now if it weren\u2019\
  t for the third car.\u201D  \n\nThe entire van watched the clock as we drove, and\
  \ hypothesized about our arrival time. We pulled into the parking lot with six minutes\
  \ to spare. Sam was trying to jump out of the van before Edwin had a chance to park.\
  \ She ran inside, and came back to say they would serve us. We cheered, and piled\
  \ out of the van. We ordered our ice cream as the staff quietly closed down around\
  \ us.\n\nI wandered around outside to be out of the staff\u2019s way while I was\
  \ eating my chocolate cone. There was a sign on the front of the building with the\
  \ history of Brymor.\n\nIn 1984, milk quotas were introduced in England, and Brian\
  \ Moore had spare milk from his Guernsey cows. He and his wife Brenda perfected\
  \ an ice cream recipe, made ice cream in the morning, and sold it in the afternoon\
  \ from an eight-foot hut on their farm in Weeton. The ice cream became incredibly\
  \ popular, and neighbors began to complain about the traffic. Brymor moved to High\
  \ Jervaulx in lower Wensleydale in 1992.\n\nIn 2011, Brenda and Brian passed away,\
  \ and their son Robert assumed leadership of Brymor. He unexpectedly passed away\
  \ in 2014, and managing the farm and business was too much for his wife and daughter.\
  \ They sold the farm and business; the herd of registered Guernsey cows moved to\
  \ a farm down the street. Robert\u2019s daughter, Nicola assumed a management position\
  \ at Brymor, and remains committed to her grandparents\u2019 recipe.\n\nToday, Brymor\
  \ has over 300,000 visitors annually. Standing there eating my ice cream and reading\
  \ the history of the farm made me incredibly sad for the Moore family who had been\
  \ through so much. But their story is also of perseverance. Despite all of the challenges,\
  \ the Moore family kept moving the farm forward as best they could, even realizing\
  \ that the future wasn\u2019t with them as owners.\n\nPerseverance is defined as\
  \ \u201Cpersistence in doing something, despite difficulty or delay in achieving\
  \ success,\u201D by Dictionary.com. Each of us has our own level of perseverance\
  \ and limits we will go to for what matters most. For the family at Brymor, it\u2019\
  s the dream and legacy that Brian and Brenda built, and the present family\u2019\
  s commitment to that dream. Our white knuckled ride was a reminder of the rewards\
  \ of perseverance, not just in the ice cream we enjoyed, but also in the story of\
  \ Brymor."
