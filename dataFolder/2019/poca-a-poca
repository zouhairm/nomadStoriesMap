Text: "In life it\u2019s who you know and what you know. I knew I wanted some time\
  \ to myself and to experience somewhere new. My Uncle Peter suggested staying in\
  \ his house in Spain and said he knew a wonderful family who lived close by who\
  \ would help me settle in. My plan was to teach online, teach English to the locals,\
  \ whilst learning Spanish myself. Plan made. Flight booked. Let the adventure begin!\n\
  I arrived at the airport and I was greeted by Blanca, the daughter, with my life\
  \ in two bags. Her Father, Carlos was waiting by the car. He was wearing a bold\
  \ floral shirt and a smile on his face. Despite his minimal English, he communicated\
  \ with his ease. He sang in the car and asked his daughter to translate what I was\
  \ saying. He oozed charisma and self-assurance. I think I was going to like this\
  \ family.\nOnce back at their city apartment I inquired about installing the internet\
  \ at my Uncle\u2019s place. It wasn\u2019t \u2018impossible\u2019 but not \u2018\
  possible\u2019. I needed a Spanish bank account, to pay for installation and to\
  \ be committed to contributing to monthly installments. Also, it was difficult to\
  \ teach English in the village and if I really wanted to, I would need a car to\
  \ work at a local academy.  Oh. Cue the feelings of inadequacy, stupidity, and lack\
  \ of forward planning. I\u2019d seemingly missed the small print for my new life.\n\
  \u2018No worries! You can use the internet at our house,\u2019 said Blanca, \u2018\
  Poco a poco.\u2019 The literal translation of \u2018Poca a poca\u2019 is \u2018\
  little by little.\u2019 Words are precious and can either elevate or devastate a\
  \ person in their time of need. The sharing of this inconsequential Spanish phrase\
  \ had provided me with a change of perspective. I sipped my tea and sighed. Everything\
  \ was fine. It was all going to work out, little by little. \nBenilloba is a small\
  \ village, around a one-hour drive from Alicante airport. The roads are steep and\
  \ windy, not for those with a fear of heights or a queasy disposition. It is surrounded\
  \ by the Alcoy and Serrella mountains. In the village, there is one bakery, a hairdresser\u2019\
  s, two banks and a few pubs. The 3km path is where the locals congregate of an evening\
  \ to either walk and gossip, to admire the views of the almond blossoms and the\
  \ crimson sunset or to work up a sweat. \nThe house I would be residing in was built\
  \ by an Englishman, named George, who had stumbled across the small Spanish village\
  \ whilst travelling from France in his van. It\u2019s a place that would be described\
  \ by an estate agent as having \u2018character\u2019 and being \u2018cosy\u2019\
  . You enter through a large wooden door and you are confronted by the living area.\
  \ You continue through to the kitchen. It\u2019s like stepping into a cave. Cold\
  \ and dark. The cold that gets into your bones.  It\u2019s dilapidated with style.\
  \ Everything has a story and a place. Whilst exploring I noticed the cupboards were\
  \ dirty and full of old tins and jars, the earliest from 1993. Mouse droppings were\
  \ scattered on the floor and thick grease lined the fridge. I opened the back door\
  \ to allow some light in. The garden was overgrown. I saw the potential. \nWith\
  \ the help of Blanca, we cleaned and added some much-needed life back into the place.\
  \ The place required some love. The love of someone living, cooking and being there.\
  \ The house was built over three floors with two verandas. I knew I would have to\
  \ become a human solar panel to survive. Play a game of chase the sun during the\
  \ day to ensure I would retain enough heat for the evenings. I opted to sleep in\
  \ the self-proclaimed \u2018pent house suite\u2019 at the top. I started to unpack,\
  \ and my nervous system began to acclimatise to the surroundings. I took a deep\
  \ breath in and whispered, \u2018Poca a Poca.\u2019"
