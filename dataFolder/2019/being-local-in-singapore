Text: "It was 2015,  my uncle invited my family and i to attend \u201C Perjumpaan\
  \ hari raya \u201C or family gathering. To be honest this is my very first time\
  \ going abroad, and i never thought that they will invited us to Singapore because\
  \ we\u2019ve been separated for years. I was born in the middle of java province,\
  \ when I was little my mother told me that one of my family member live in Singapore\
  \ at that time it was really far from java.\nThe first generation of Haji Tahir\
  \ Bin Sardi ( which is my grandma\u2019s brother) family migrated from java to Singapore\
  \ in 1914, and set up their roots in kampong renjong. In 2015 Singapore celebrated\
  \ 50 years of independence day, but their family has been in Singapore from 101\
  \ years ago. \nAlmost 3 hours fly from Jakarta, we arrived at Changi Airport Singapore.\
  \ The only problem I thought how do I find my uncle? While we never met before.\
  \ After immigration Checking, while waiting for luggage, A man around 60 years old\
  \ standing right in front of me and calling my name \u201Cismi from Indonesia\u201D\
  \ I suddenly notice that voice, it maybe one of our relatives in Singapore. Then\
  \ I ran into him and talk to him \u201C yes , I\u2019m ismi and u must be pak cik\
  \ ( uncle ),right ?\u201D then he immedietly hold my hand and say \u201Cyes this\
  \ is me, long time no see, ya ? you already grown up. I don\u2019t know why I was\
  \ touched, we never met before but he recognize me well ,maybe he saw my photo first.\
  \ After that \u201Ctouching meeting\u201D we are all heading to apartmen at Serangoon.\
  \ \nIn the upcoming day, we trying to mingle around with all of the family member,\
  \ although they live in Singapore for a long time, some of them can speak javanese\
  \ fluently. We also tried authentic breakfast menu \u201Cnasi lemak\u201D, it is\
  \ rich flavour rice with vegetables, boiled egg, salted fish and sambal. After it\
  \ my relatives and I will visiting Mustafa Center to buy some groceries and other\
  \ stuff. Mustafa center is one of the 24 hours store in Singapore , u can find almost\
  \ everything with affordable price. We use  MRT to reach it, As I can see along\
  \ the way the city was clean, and everything was automatically. I was impressed\
  \ by the city. In the afternoon we had lunch at Pakistani restaurant we order murtabak\
  \ dan teh tarik, It taste good and it is a little different than murtabak in Indonesia.\
  \ \nIn the next day, we are all together at UE Convention Center to attending the\
  \ family gathering. Everyone is come, from the second generation until now. It was\
  \ a big challenge to get everyone together ( and also to capture everyone in the\
  \ photo) and the organizers did a great job in bringing all of us together under\
  \ one roof to \u201C mengeratkan silaturahim dan ukhuwah\u201D."
