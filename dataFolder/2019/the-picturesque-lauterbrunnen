Text: "Going to Lauterbrunnen, Switzerland is one of the blessings I got in 2018.\
  \ A heaven on earth. It becomes the most amazing place I\u2019ve ever been to. The\
  \ more I remember every detail of that moment, the more I realize that nothing can\
  \ beat the beauty of mother nature, not even the man-made ones.\nLauterbrunnen is\
  \ one of the villages in Jungfrau region, the heart of the Swiss Alps, Switzerland.\
  \ It is one of my favorite destinations in Europe. Clean air, breathtaking scenery\
  \ and other essential things we can\u2019t get in the city are the ones that Lauterbrunnen\
  \ promises to give.\nHow to get there\nThis depends on where you start from. My\
  \ friend and I started from Florence, Italy. We took train as we had Eurail Pass.\
  \ The route was Florence-Milan-Brig-Spiez-Interlaken-Lauterbrunnen. The view during\
  \ the train ride must be the one everyone has been looking for. Oh, a tip for you!\
  \ Don\u2019t forget to take a few minutes during the transit to go outside the Spiez\
  \ station to see the beautiful lake.\nThe Eurail Pass only covers the train ticket\
  \ to Interlaken. We had to buy train and one-way cable car ticket from Interlaken\
  \ to Murren via Lauterbrunnen. It included in one ticket. It costed CHF14,2 as there\
  \ was a discount for Eurail Pass holder.\nThings to do\nTake a hike or walk. Some\
  \ people said that Lauterbrunnen is a hiker\u2019s dream. Unfortunately, we weren\u2019\
  t able to do so due to the limited time. But we did a gentle walk up the valley\
  \ floor as some travel blogger suggested. It took us to see a scenic outlook. We\
  \ also witnessed an everyday village life like taking a walk or riding a bike, feeding\
  \ their pets, watering their plants, etc. We saw some cows and mountain goats during\
  \ the walk and we thought it\u2019s not only humans who are happy living there,\
  \ but also the animals. No kidding, but the animals look happy and healthy \U0001F600\
  \nTake a ride. Lauterbrunnen is also famous for its mountain biking, but be careful!\
  \ Some valley sides are steep.\nSee Staubbach Falls. I consider Staubbach Falls\
  \ as the signature waterfall of Lauterbrunnen valley. It\u2019s very iconic. You\
  \ can walk up the valley to see it. The waterfall has an impressive flow with a\
  \ mist of spray."
