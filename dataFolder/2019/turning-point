Text: From my childhood itself, I really wanted to do an interesting and enthusiastic
  job with lots of excitements. However, as the time passed, my journey turned to
  a different field. But still my passion is inside. So I really wanted to travel,
  to move and to change every single day. What ever the problem comes, I determind,
  that somehow I will fullfil my dream. Finally I worked for apparel industry and
  I really enjoyed it and wanted to learn more on same. By then, according to my parents,
  espeacially my mother, I have to find my soul mate and marry need to lead a marriage
  life. So I obey them and they selected me the guy and married. By that time, he
  was abroad and after the marriage I have to travel with him. Actually, by that reason
  I really did not want to marry that guy. As time flew, I got my Visa and I had to
  leave my motherland and parents. Somehow, I changed my mind and decided to go. Now
  I'm also living abroad, having one son. Living, facing all the life challenges alone
  and I still believe the best yet to come and did not forget my final destination.
