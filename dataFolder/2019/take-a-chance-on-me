Text: "There wasn't much I feared, as a 25 year-old girl looking for a break from\
  \ my dutiful life. After caring for my grandmother and losing her to Alzheimer's,\
  \ it felt right to want to go live with a young couple in Cyprus I had met two years'\
  \ prior for only a few days before my holiday ended. It was totally unlike me, yet\
  \ felt totally right. I quit my job at an advertising agency, begged some money\
  \ off my parents, and arrived in Larnaca without a worry. My new friends happened\
  \ to own a beachfront hotel, yet lived in nearby apartments in the tourist village\
  \ of Ayia Napa. \n\nWe looked at each other with excitement and nervousness and\
  \ my two friends asked, \"So what do you want to do here this summer?\" I knew Constantinos\
  \ and his wealthy family were well known and he had asked me on the phone about\
  \ things I enjoyed. I said I loved to write. \"I have a friend with a little tourist\
  \ newspaper you can meet,\" he offered. \"I've done voiceover work on our local\
  \ radio station back home and a bit of reading for the blind too,\" I added. He\
  \ and his wife, Morena, laughed at my giddiness. I remember so clearly how happy\
  \ I was to have a chance to do such fun things in a sunny beach town without another\
  \ care in the world for the first time in my life. Constantinos let out a deep chortle\
  \ I came to know so well and said, \"Ok, we know the people who own the radio station\
  \ too.\"\n\nAs the blazing hot summer came on full-force and 42-degree heat became\
  \ almost (but not quite) unbearable, my bike rides to the top of the hill in the\
  \ dead of night to learn the music board inside the dark, deserted radio station\
  \ were such a triumphant journey. I think of all that dead-air the drunk holiday-goers\
  \ suffered through if they listened in the early morning hours, as I bumbled through\
  \ my show those first weeks and I laugh out loud at the memory. Such a novice, but\
  \ full of enthusiasm, always. The writing was the most enjoyable part, actually,\
  \ as I could tell a story about anything I wanted, edit it myself, and help the\
  \ publisher put the paper together for printing each week for the village hotels.\
  \ \n\nIt also happened that a bunch of New Zealanders had been hired by Constantinos\
  \ and his business partners to run a bungee over the water at his hotel, and he\
  \ asked if I'd mind sitting around there in the afternoons, just to be sure they\
  \ weren't cheating him. And so I did. Five Kiwi boys who'd come from Gold Coast,\
  \ Australia to set up Bungee Downunder were quite the attraction to the European\
  \ and Scandinavian girls. Each of them were nice enough, but surely thought themselves\
  \ more attractive than a mirror would prove. One of them took a liking to me for\
  \ some reason, and wouldn't leave me alone. Meanwhile I was busy each morning with\
  \ my radio show and also making deals with scuba diving companies and tourism operators\
  \ to write about their ventures in exchange for free opportunities to try each one.\
  \ Bungee jumping into the Med, scuba diving to earn my Padi license, and cruising\
  \ to Lebanon to see the birthplace of my grandmother who, at 94 years old and in\
  \ her most latent stage of Alzheimer's disease, could vividly recall the majestic\
  \ limestone cathedral her father had built next to the sea. I saw every stunning\
  \ bit of it myself. Then, most life-changing of all, I surrendered to the pestering\
  \ Kiwi for a date. \n\nThat magical trip that saw me completely let go of my inhibitions\
  \ and find out what I was made of, changed my life's direction. The next 30 years\
  \ included a marriage (yes, to the Kiwi), the loss of both my parents, two baby\
  \ boys, a move to New Zealand for a 13-year life stint that was a revelation in\
  \ the beauty of living simply, and finally, a move back to the U.S. without a husband\
  \ and father. And so, onward I go. Can't wait to see what happens next."
