Text: 'I am a brazilian girl. I always traveled a lot inside my country but I had
  never had a opportunity to know another country. That was my dream. So I worked
  a lot to save money but I didn''t know to which country I will finally choose. One
  day, watching tv, I saw three girls travelling around Europe at summer. I was astonished!
  I decided to go to Europe at summer, of course, but when I begun to plan the trip
  I forgot which country those girls were. So I begun to search in youtube, google,
  everywhere, because I would like to go to that country! And finally I found! It
  was Croatia! Oh, Croatia! But I didn''t know anyone that had been there, so I couldn''t
  some friends to go with me because people didn''t trust that my chosen destiny was
  amazing. Finally two friends agree to go with me. I was really really happy! I dreamt
  evereday to be there. I planned all of things of trip: tickets, hotels, tours. I
  was afraid to communication there because I am not sure the croatians spoken english
  or if they could understand me but all was perfect! And when I finally was there
  I feel that I was the best choice because I am sure that trip was the best of my
  life. I did this trip in 2012 and nowadays Croatia is a trend destiny in Europe
  and I have already sent my itinerary for more than 30 people so far. After Croatia,
  I have already been in more 15 countries and I always choose something exotic place
  or destiny to inspire my family, friends and all people around me. I was definitely
  born to travel and share my experiences with everyone. I''m so happy about that.'
