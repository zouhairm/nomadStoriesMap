Text: "After almost six years, which I perceive mainly because of my gray hair, I\
  \ return for no apparent reason to Brazil, specifically to Brasilia, without having\
  \ any idea of \u200B\u200Bwhat to expect. Six years that have helped me to realize\
  \ that I still live in Buenos Aires, and that in just a few months I will be ten\
  \ years of being stranded? in the south of the continent.\nEvery time I have faced\
  \ Brazil it has been necessary to predispose myself to reality with the tools of\
  \ an enchanted ethnographer: Brazil is such a powerful spell that one forgets that\
  \ one is dreaming.\nThis is my first weekend in Brasilia and I have already been\
  \ invited to a \"love\" party in a winery that functions as a brothel on weekdays.\
  \ Surprisingly, the architecture of the city is striking, which is almost identical\
  \ everywhere where there are room and business houses: a kind of premises on the\
  \ ground floors of the buildings where people gather to drink, dance or sell products.\
  \ As far as the naked eye is concerned, bisexuality is something recurrent, people\
  \ are muito legal and the good vibes seem straight out of paradise.\nThe first thing\
  \ that fascinates Brasilia, once you have reached the Monumental Axis that contains\
  \ the emblematic works of Oscar Niemeyer, is the size of silence: in this strange\
  \ landscape only clouds can feel comfortable, grazing in their beautiful starched\
  \ sky or perhaps improbable giants of a civilization to come. Because nothing in\
  \ this urban project is thinking for the human being, but for giants, otherwise\
  \ it is not explained how someone would plan a 16 kilometer axis that goes from\
  \ the Bus Station in the center to the Square of the Three Powers without trees\
  \ to the round and therefore without shade, which prevents that in the middle of\
  \ so many tons of concrete and with an oppressive heat someone can sit down to rest.\n\
  Walking these strange spaces -if something looks like capital Brasilia is of the\
  \ Unknown Dimension- seems something halfway between a lunar landscape and a strange\
  \ symmetrical horror focused on the search for beauty and social justice, the delirium\
  \ of a species that tried to build for beings that do not exist a hell without measure.\
  \ The buildings where people live are similar to the images of future civilizations\
  \ that I have glimpsed in some trips of DMT, but without the clarity of those colors\
  \ of psychedelic delirium. Brasilia seems built with the thick and hopeless stuff\
  \ of nightmares: a place crossed by immense desolate highways like the silence that\
  \ stifles it at night. Surely David Lynch would love it.\nSomething apocalyptic\
  \ is the place: with the buildings closed, the dirty facades, the Library without\
  \ books and all hope of sociability reduced to shopping, Brasilia is the present\
  \ of the past of a future that never came. The spell that comes from the monuments\
  \ reveals something less pleasing: this is not a city but a mystery.\nThe megalomania\
  \ of Oscar Niemayer was to build a model to be photographed, not lived, that not\
  \ only denies the idiosyncrasy of the Brazilian people but that of the human being:\
  \ here the street has been thrown into the street and that is why we walk outdoors.\
  \ This sensation becomes evident because, after a short time of touring it, one\
  \ feels that there is nothing to do here; but not in the manner of boredom of any\
  \ city in the West, but with the tragic tinge of the irremediable: because the so-called\
  \ Pilot Plane of the city has been considered a Historical Heritage of Humanity,\
  \ Brasilia can never change. If this fact is added the finding that Brasilia is\
  \ a city without corners can give a pretty finished idea of \u200B\u200Bwhat it\
  \ means to be lost. Although accurate I would say denatured.\nThe distance that\
  \ separates the nightmare from dreams is usually diffuse, sometimes barely perceptible:\
  \ you end up forgetting if you were ever awake.\nNever as in Brasilia one is forced\
  \ to suspend everything he thought he knew of a city: this place is the gateway\
  \ to the Babylon of the tropics. And that is the story that I come to tell."
