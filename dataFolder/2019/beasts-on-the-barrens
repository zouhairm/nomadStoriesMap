Text: "\"Wow,\" I thought. In my wildest dreams I wasn't expecting to see something\
  \ like this.\n\nIn several pick-up trucks, they collected all of us. We were the\
  \ non-locals, the resident kabloonaks, in the tiny village of Holman, now known\
  \ as Uluhaktok, population 340, nestled on the northwest shore of Victoria Island\
  \ in Canada's Western Arctic. \"Bring your cameras,\" they shouted. So, there we\
  \ were. A group of about 10 nurses, managers, teachers and others clinging to the\
  \ backs of the trucks as they careened down the road toward the airport. The trucks\
  \ turned off to the left onto a road that just leads off onto the tundra. In short\
  \ order, we started to see a crowd. As we approached, it became very clear that\
  \ they were all ooo-ing and ahh-ing at three mature musk oxen who must have wandered\
  \ close to town. \n\nElders were busy talking about musk ox and their importance\
  \ to local culture. Nikons and Canons and Sonys, some in their owners' hands and\
  \ some on tripods, were pointing and shooting, focusing and videoing. The excitement\
  \ of seeing musk ox for the first time was palpable. Learning about their importance\
  \ in local culture and how the various parts of the animal would be used was absolutely\
  \ fascinating. In particular, one of the types of craftwork for which Holman is\
  \ well known are carvings made from the distinctive horns adorning these majestic\
  \ beasts. The wool, or qiviut, is carefully separated from the fur and is spun into\
  \ yarn, prized for its softness and insulation value.\n\nWhile the elders shared\
  \ stories of interactions with musk ox in the past, several local hunters prepared\
  \ to take their shots. Now that all the kabloonaks had had their opportunity to\
  \ see musk ox in the wild and to learn more about them through the stories told\
  \ by elders, the hunters took aim. Bang! Bang! Bang! Almost in unison. All three\
  \ beasts tumbled to the ground and teams of local Inuit descended on their prey\
  \ and started preparing the meat, hide and carcasses for transport into the village\
  \ some three kilometres away. Not a scrap was left behind. Every part of the animals\
  \ had a use.\n\nIt was interesting watching them work. They knew exactly what they\
  \ were doing and it looked as though they had been working together for ages. Some\
  \ of them may very well have done just that. Meat was being cut into manageable\
  \ cubes, about 2-3 kg for each piece. As pieces were cut, they were assembly lined\
  \ by a group of kids to the nearest truck and stacked carefully on liners of plastic.\
  \ \n\nLater that night, as many of us were back safely in our own homes reminiscing\
  \ about the day we saw musk ox, relating the stories by phone to loved ones many\
  \ thousands of kilometres away, a knock came at the door. I went to see who it was.\
  \ As I opened the door was one of the women from the musk ox group with a package.\
  \ It contained one piece of musk ox meat, maybe about 3 kg. She beamed as she handed\
  \ it to me. To be honest, I'd never in my life even considered eating musk ox, and\
  \ now I and all others in town had a care package. It would become dinner the next\
  \ day for a small group of us and, I have to tell you, musk ox is absolutely the\
  \ most tender and tasty meat I've ever eaten. \n\nI've never again eaten any musk\
  \ ox, but it was such a wonderful experience being included, first as a tourist,\
  \ then as a student, and finally as a community member. I learned a lot that day\
  \ - about musk ox in general, about their connections with Inuit villages and culture,\
  \ and about how communities pull together to celebrate the wondrous things that\
  \ arrive by chance and how to share those experiences with friends and family.\n\
  \nI wish every person could experience wonders like my musk ox laden afternoon in\
  \ Holman. This has emerged as one of my all-time favourite stories to share. The\
  \ world has so much to share and we all have so much to learn.\n\nWow!"
