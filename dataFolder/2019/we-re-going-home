Text: "\u201CSay goodbye to your friends,\u201D my mom said as she held my little\
  \ hands in her palms. \u201CWe\u2019re going home.\u201D\n\nI saw my mother\u2019\
  s eyes widen and felt her grip on my hands tighten as she said these last three\
  \ words. I knew something significant was happening \u2013 the look on my mom\u2019\
  s face gave that much away. But as a five year old American-born child of immigrants,\
  \ I didn\u2019t quite understand what she meant. \n\nTo me, home was the suburban\
  \ Illinois house where I grew up eating cereal and watching Bear in the Big Blue\
  \ House every morning.\n \nHome was where I\u2019d go on shopping trips to Walmart\
  \ and throw tantrums when my mom wouldn\u2019t buy me every toy on both sides of\
  \ the aisle at Toys \u201CR\u201DUs. \n\nHome was where my cousin would ask her\
  \ teacher for flashcards that she used to teach me the English alphabet \u2013 an\
  \ activity I dreaded with every ounce my tiny being. \n\nHome was where my best\
  \ friend was a blue-eyed, blonde-haired boy named Scott who\u2019d tell me stories\
  \ about school \u2013experiences that were alien to me. \n\nAs the days went by,\
  \ our doorbell started ringing more frequently. Some days it was our neighbors that\
  \ walked through the door carrying gifts of all kinds \u2013 home-baked meals, flowers,\
  \ hand-written cards, you name it.  Other times, it was my mom\u2019s friends hugging,\
  \ laughing, and tearing up all within a few minutes. \n\nMost often, however, it\
  \ was Scott and his mother at the flip-side of the door. As Scott would hand over\
  \ everything from stuffed toys to bags full of candy, my mother and his would have\
  \ serious conversations in muffled voices. Too young to know or care about what\
  \ was happening, Scott and I would eat our sweets and wipe our hands on our shirts,\
  \ giggling at what children that age giggle about \u2013 nothing and everything.\
  \ \n\nAnd just like that, the visits stopped \u2013 or I probably just felt that\
  \ way because we were always out of the house; buying one thing, returning the other.\
  \ \n\nA few days later, I woke up to find that my mom had pulled out four large\
  \ suitcases that she filled with everything from clothes to crockery. That same\
  \ night, my uncle came home with four tickets in his hand. O\u2019Hare International\
  \ Airport to Jinnah International Airport, each one of them read, with four different\
  \ names on them \u2013 names of me, my mother, and my siblings. \n\nAnd that\u2019\
  s when I put all pieces together.\n\nIn just a few hours, I\u2019d be on an airplane\
  \ to a place that I knew nothing about; a place where they probably spoke a different\
  \ language, and didn\u2019t watch Sesame Street. \n\nA place where my best friend\
  \ wouldn\u2019t be a light-skinned boy whose last name I\u2019d forget over the\
  \ years. \n\nA place where young girls with Pakistani features and American accents\
  \ were the odd ones out. \n\nI broke down.\n\nEvery moment I spent in the United\
  \ States as a five year old from that point on are just a blur. I\u2019m not sure\
  \ who drove us to the airport or carried our luggage. I don\u2019t know how many\
  \ people bade us farewell or tousled my dark black curls at the airport. I don\u2019\
  t remember how long I waited to board my flight to this place my mother was evidently\
  \ ecstatic about going back to. \n\nWhat I do remember, though, is how I got off\
  \ the airplane at Karachi\u2019s airport, ranting endlessly about how long the flight\
  \ was and how terrible the food was \u2013 all until a familiar figure appeared\
  \ in the distance.\n\nThe closer I got to it, the less I believed my eyes. My father\
  \ stood before me with his arms wide open \u2013 my parent who I hadn\u2019t seen\
  \ in almost two years. \n\nIt was at that very moment that I threw my little backpack\
  \ on the floor and ran into his arms.\n \n\u201CWelcome back,\u201D my dad grinned.\
  \ \n\nI was home."
