Text: "\u201CThe French are known for their rudeness,\u201D my grandmother told me\
  \ matter-of-factly one day over lunch. \u201CDon\u2019t even bother talking to them\
  \ unless you are fluent in French,\u201D my uncle added in a warning tone. I had\
  \ never actually met anyone from France until 2012, when my parents and I travelled\
  \ to Europe for the first time. During my stay there, I met an elderly couple who\
  \ would teach me an unforgettable lesson about stereotypes.\n\n\tEverything started\
  \ in Paris. It was our last night there, and my mother was \u2013 in her own words\
  \ \u2013 in desperate need of a new pair of boots. As we walked along the Champs-\xC9\
  lys\xE9es, she explored several stores until she found just the right pair of leather\
  \ ankle boots.  After her purchase, we had dinner at a restaurant which had a magnificent\
  \ view of the Arc de Triomphe. As soon as we finished eating, we returned to the\
  \ hotel since we had to wake up early the following morning to take a bus to Tours,\
  \ a city in the centre-west of France. It was around midnight \u2013 right after\
  \ my mother opened the shoe box \u2013 that the merde hit the fan. As expected,\
  \ inside the box were the brown ankle boots she had bought \u2013 except that only\
  \ one of them was brown, while the other one was black. Upon a quick internet search,\
  \ she learned both that the store was unsurprisingly closed, and that that particular\
  \ shoe brand was only available in Paris. Frustrating as it was, there was nothing\
  \ we could do.\n\n\tThe following day in Tours, my mother acted as though she had\
  \ completely forgotten about the whole ordeal, faking a smile and talking just about\
  \ anything other than the boots. After having visited the Cath\xE9drale Saint-Gatien\
  \ and the Mus\xE9e des Beaux-Arts, my parents were rather tired and decided to rest\
  \ at a caf\xE9. I refused to sit with them, however, and reminded them that we still\
  \ had two hours left before taking the bus to Bordeaux. Thanks to my stubborn attitude,\
  \ they gave me permission to explore the city by myself, as long as I promised to\
  \ meet them at the bus station at five o\u2019clock on the dot. I decided to bring\
  \ the shoe box with me, just in case.\n\n\tAccompanied by Google Maps, my camera,\
  \ and the boots, I wandered through the centre for some time, taking in the buildings\
  \ and houses which had a fairy tale resemblance that made me want to know every\
  \ corner of the city. As I still had plenty of time left, I entered a kids\u2019\
  \ clothing store in order to buy a present for my cousin Martina, who was four years\
  \ old at the time. There were no other customers inside, and the only people I spotted\
  \ were an old couple who I assumed owned the place. We chatted for a while \u2013\
  \ I mostly addressed the man in Spanish, who then provided the French translation\
  \ to his wife \u2013 and the topic of the Parisian boots came up. After listening\
  \ to my story, the man assured me that they would help me, and then his wife called\
  \ the shoe store. Although I was not able to understand a single word the woman\
  \ said while on the phone, her tone was strong and demanding. Once the conversation\
  \ ended, the man explained to me in Spanish that they would give me the money which\
  \ had been spent on those boots, and that the next time they saw their son, who\
  \ lived in Paris and visited them every weekend, they would give him the boots and\
  \ he would return them to the store, where he would get a refund.\n\n\tAfter thanking\
  \ them for all the trouble, I checked the time again and realized I had to leave\
  \ immediately if I wanted to get to the station at five o\u2019clock. Unfortunately,\
  \ as I left in a hurry, I forgot to ask for their names or to write down the name\
  \ of their store. Nevertheless, every time a friend of mine asks me about my stay\
  \ in Europe, rather than thinking about the Eiffel Tower or the Colosseum, I fondly\
  \ remember the kind-hearted couple who helped me without expecting anything in return."
