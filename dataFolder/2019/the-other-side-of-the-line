Text: "\u2018Pakistan Murdabad\u2019 (Death to Pakistan) chants a shoe seller in his\
  \ successful bid to attract customers and of course the limelight of media. In the\
  \ aftermath of a devastating terror attack on the Indian security forces claimed\
  \ by a Pakistani terror outfit, matters got quickly escalated with a loud war cry\
  \ among Indians desperate to seek revenge from their \u2018eternal enemy\u2019 Pakistan.\
  \ In this heated environment of jingoistic fervor anyone who utters the word peace\
  \ is immediately adjudged a traitor. Only a few brave to point out the rationality\
  \ of accord. As the war cry gets louder by the day & tempers high, the land of Mahatma\
  \ Gandhi silently weeps while I make a quick prayer for sense to prevail. The world\
  \ seems to fade away in irony as an imaginary line drawn by foreign men merely 70\
  \ years ago has fabricated a tale of perpetual acrimony on the very land which sung\
  \ songs of Hindu-Muslim fraternity.  As I shut my eyes in contemplation with my\
  \ mind engaged in myriad thoughts, I ride back to some sincere realizations of the\
  \ past.\n\u201CIf you have a Pakistani Visa on your passport you better forget getting\
  \ a US or European one\u201D my cousin had mocked. His words did scare me a bit\
  \ but not enough to vitiate a long cherished fantasy to explore the other side.\
  \ I had been nominated by my school to attend a MUN in Lahore. There is an old saying\
  \ from before partition \u2013 The one, who hasn\u2019t seen Lahore, hasn\u2019\
  t seen anything. God was I not excited to visit the land that no one in my acquaintances\
  \ had and probably never will set foot on.\nAstride the minibus, a cocktail of thoughts\
  \ sprang to my mind \u2013 what sort of people will they be? What if they hate me?\
  \ \u2013 And the like. These negativities instantaneously vanished as I stood with\
  \ one foot on either side of the Wagah border, valiantly posing for a picture, feeling\
  \ no less honored than the astronauts who had set foot on the moon. \nAt my destination,\
  \ the humble greetings in Urdu got me stunned. How could a language, sweeter than\
  \ sugar possibly construe evil words? Having been put up in a dorm with girls from\
  \ another Pakistani school, my mentor reminded me to put on more conservative clothing\
  \ given their orthodox views. I was dumbfounded to see those Pakistani ladies in\
  \ shorts for the night. I couldn\u2019t help thinking if I would be judged for my\
  \ overly covering clothes (the only sort I had packed for the trip). \nAs I entered\
  \ the committee meeting room next morning I noticed a girl fully covered in a white\
  \ \u2018burkha\u2019. I felt sorry for this reticent lady who was subjugated to\
  \ wear such clothing, forever chained under the weight of patriarchy. But perhaps,\
  \ I had been too quick to judge. In an instance, this very lady effortlessly took\
  \ over the entire attention of the committee by her powerful speech.\nIt was during\
  \ an informal interaction with my committee mates that I confronted the most unforgettable\
  \ dialogue of my journey. One of them hesitantly asked, \u201Cwhy do you Indians\
  \ hate us\u201D?. I was numbed, a thousand thoughts ran in my mind \u2013 wasn\u2019\
  t it Pakistan who always hated India, what made him think otherwise. With no answer\
  \ at hand I vigorously tried to find one. A sudden realization that back in India\
  \ everyone would confidently and proudly acclaim their core hatred towards Pakistan,\
  \ but on what basis, perhaps no one knew. As he stared at me still waiting for an\
  \ answer I managed to address a polite lie, \u201C No, we don\u2019t hate you\u201D\
  . In a moment\u2019s time all the blabber of years and years of war mongering came\
  \ to a crushing defeat. I couldn\u2019t think of a single reason why either side\
  \ should hate the other. Why two nations who had unimaginable number of poor people\
  \ dying of hunger and disease everyday were spending billions on guns and artilleries.\
  \ Who did we want to fight, our own selves? What cloak of ignorance had we been\
  \ wearing which couldn\u2019t see the same culture and ethos that existed on either\
  \ side? All this just because of the 70 year old line."
