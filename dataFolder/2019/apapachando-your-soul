Text: "How fearful I was of travelling by myself to a new place, Asia. Little did\
  \ I know, that experience would open my eyes to somewhere new and to fall in love\
  \ with people who I talked and sing just for a few hours. \nBack in January 2018,\
  \ I decided to make a 'list' of places I would love to visit, amongst my top 10,\
  \ for some reason, was Thailand, somehow by mid June, I had bought my ticket to\
  \ Thailand. \nI was so fearful, I knew very little about the country and culture,\
  \ and going solo, oh my, what was I thinking, I knew close to anything about their\
  \ religion, their do's and do not's, food, culture, well basically I knew nothing,\
  \ I just have heard about somewhere called Ko phi phi, some islands people go on\
  \ their honeymoon, and so. \nThe airline had cancelled my flight, my opportunity\
  \ to get my money back, but something was off, my guts where screaming to go there.\
  \ Many days went by and the idea of either changing the flight or definitely cancelling\
  \ the trip was still on my mind, so I spoke with a friend, she said: 'go, one of\
  \ the best places I've ever been'. So, I did, I changed the schedule of the flight\
  \ instead of cancelling it. It was December 14th, I was on my way, Mexico city-Japan-Bangkok-Phuket,\
  \ man!, I was tired!.\nOnce I got to my taxi (who expected me at the airport) I\
  \ decided to roll down the windows and gasp some air, I was there, flights where\
  \ great, so far, so good.\nLet me tell you, my hotel, 4th floor, sea view, terrace,\
  \ night, waves crashing on the shore, clean room. That. It was it, I had fallen\
  \ in love with the night in Phuket. Next day, breakfast, wow! from fruit to soups\
  \ and salads, eggs, bacon, thai food, noodles, you name it. It was time to go to\
  \ meet the elephants to an elephant sanctuary. I spent my whole day feeding, bathing,\
  \ cleaning, and playing with elephants, learnt about their different species, cooking\
  \ original thai food, 2nd day, Koh Phi Phi Islands, oh my!, what a view, beautiful\
  \ place, big green island, crystaline warm ocean waters, white sandy beaches, so\
  \ many fish, so many corals. That place, for a honeymoon must have been amazing,\
  \ but riding it solo, it was my very own experience, I felt drunk in emotions, savoring\
  \ every single second of it.\nThe People, I met so many people who where amazingly\
  \ nice, I thought I new friendly people as a mexican, but people from thailand and\
  \ phillipines... what a delight! They would offer you a friendly smile every second,\
  \ they will assist you, guide you, invite you, thank you just for being there. They\
  \ even put me on a karaoke at a restaurant just to listen to my horrible spanish\
  \ singing accent at the beat of Luis Fonsis' 'despacito'. But at the end of the\
  \ night they would invite me to come again tomorrow, having a great smile and a\
  \ big hug at my disposal.\nThailand, that was it for me, I had fallen in love with\
  \ the place, the moon, the waves, their many islands, the so kind smiley people,\
  \ the  delicious flavors of their food, the upbeat music, the multicultural streets,\
  \ the wonderful beaches, the great elephants, the culture, temples, the eveything.\
  \ \nThailand is the experience, going solo, or on a trip with friends or in your\
  \ honeymoon, it has it all, but most of it, it has a kind warmth that you can't\
  \ really have anywhere else."
