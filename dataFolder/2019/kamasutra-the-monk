Text: "After repeatedly saying that his name was Francesco Totti, the Burmese youngster\
  \ with shaved head finally revealed his real name. We were not even sure if we\u2019\
  d heard it correctly. My Italian travel companion called him \u2018Chemistry\u2019\
  , but I thought it sounded more like \u2018Kamasutra\u2019. The rough morning suddenly\
  \ became so much brighter the moment we met him along the U-Bein Bridge, in our\
  \ effort to catch sunrise for the umpteenth time.\n\nSunrise, for late sleepers,\
  \ provoked a furious battle each morning when the alarm clock shrieked. It was a\
  \ fight between the determination to not miss one of the most breathtaking panoramas\
  \ and a strong temptation to pull our blanket over our head and plunge back into\
  \ blessed oblivion. It was even harder after a long trip in a small minibus that\
  \ smelled like shrimp paste the night before, so we found it extremely challenging\
  \ to be excited about anything. Fatigue, sore throat, and a clogged nose had made\
  \ me grow almost indifferent towards any beauty Myanmar could offer. But having\
  \ seen so many monks in their unique robes, one of my few wishes left was to know\
  \ more about them and their solemn life.\n\nThe encounter with Kamasutra taught\
  \ me that sometimes you\u2019re lucky enough to have your wish granted in the blink\
  \ of an eye. Instead of maintaining a distance with the two female strangers, he\
  \ struck up a conversation with us in decent English. Note that eight out of ten\
  \ people we stopped on the street to ask for directions literally escaped from us,\
  \ shaking their heads to show us that they did not speak our language, while the\
  \ rest were bold enough to help with nervous gestures. That\u2019s why meeting someone\
  \ with understandable pronunciation was like finding a treasure.\n\nKamasutra opened\
  \ our eyes into a glimpse of monastery life, a secluded world he\u2019d entered\
  \ at the tender age of 16. \u201CIt was my own choice\u201D, he emphasized, after\
  \ saying that his daily routine was like a prisoner\u2019s life (a good prison,\
  \ though, he added), consisting of mostly meditation and studying of Buddha\u2019\
  s teachings, which he summarized into four main ones: no sexual pleasure, no stealing,\
  \ no killing, and no bragging.\n\nHe sat with us during breakfast but only took\
  \ a cup of coffee when we offered to buy him something to eat. \u201CThank you,\
  \ it\u2019s not that I do not want to eat with you, but I am really full,\u201D\
  \ he refused politely. We then learned that they eat breakfast and lunch at a specific\
  \ time, without dinner. \n\nWe gladly accepted his invitation to come to his monastery\
  \ nearby, where around 1,200 monks live. As we continued chitchatting we grew fonder\
  \ of his great sense of humor. When asked whether he missed his family, he sighed\
  \ and told us about his twin brother who works in China and comes home once or twice\
  \ every four years.\n\n\u201CAnd yeah, I also miss my girlfriends sometimes,\u201D\
  \ he sighed again.\n\n\u201CWhat??? You have a girlfriend?\u201D we stared at him,\
  \ totally scandalized.\n\n\u201CMany,\u201D he giggled with beaming eyes, clearly\
  \ pleased with the effect of his joke. And there\u2019s much more where it came\
  \ from. He loved making shocking statements, but then his cute giggles betrayed\
  \ him.\n\nWhen I saw some robes hanging on the rope outside their dorms, I could\
  \ not help but asking him how many he possessed.\n\n\u201CI actually have a lot,\u201D\
  \ he answered. \u201CUmm\u2026 like three or four.\u201D\n\nNo giggles this time.\
  \ A pang of remorse gnawed at me mercilessly. I remembered so many times when I\
  \ stared at my crowded wardrobe and complained that I had nothing to wear! \n\n\u201C\
  I don\u2019t have much,\u201D he said, as if able to read my mind. \u201CBut I feel\
  \ rich.\u201D\n\nIndeed. People like him, who know how to be content with what they\
  \ have, no matter how little, are rich at heart.\n\n\u201CI will never forget you,\u201D\
  \ he said, shortly before we said goodbye. \n\nAnd as I still have a clear mental\
  \ picture of him giggling with those mischievous twinkles in his eyes, I realized\
  \ that the unforgettable one is him, not us. We were lucky to have crossed paths\
  \ with him that blessed morning."
