Text: "My visits to Goa would be every once or twice a year. Seeing my relatives,\
  \ watching my cousins grow, admiring the garden so beautifully maintained by my\
  \ Godmother was something indelible. My hometown is in the South of Goa. It's not\
  \ the place donning in neon lights or budging with paint-faced people dancing to\
  \ the blasting tunes of Electronic Dance Music at 3 am. \n\nIt's quiet, most of\
  \ it. The weather would always be humid, with warm Arabian winds swaddling the atmosphere.\
  \ The wind would blow so hard, that the sweet smelling palm trees would oscillate\
  \ aggressively, letting you breathe them in, all at once. The sea would reek of\
  \ fish and the endless amount of salt that was embodied in her. Most of all, the\
  \ sand would be cold and grainy, making your palm feel empty, as it tried to escape\
  \ from the tiny gap it had. \n\nAt most times, I'd be home, reading a book while\
  \ gaping at the view of a gorgeous field, with sounds of frogs, foxes and other\
  \ insects unknown. I'd hear my grandmother call out to her grandchildren, like an\
  \ alarm clock, reminding them of regular meals and tea-time intervals. \n\nGoa,\
  \ to most tourists, is an enchantress, hoarding tons of cheap alcohol, rave-filled\
  \ nights with music and endless intoxication. To me, it was an escape from the ordinary.\n\
  \ \nRapes, drug overdose and murder, most of them in the north of the state. These\
  \ made for regular headlines in most publications of Goa. The memory of relatives\
  \ narrating blood-curdling incidents of the catastrophes happening in that part,\
  \ would always give me goosebumps. I had never spent a significant time in the north\
  \ of Goa. This time, I wanted to. \n\nMy journey began with my first stop at Arambol,\
  \ a tiny village, with more people than it can hold. The lanes of Arambol looked\
  \ busier than ever during the day, with street vendors selling, bidding and bargaining\
  \ with customers of every colour, size, shape and language. The communication skills\
  \ of the vendors made me question my own. I walked up a hill and witnessed my first\
  \ sunset from over the top, only minutes before the majestic fiery ball was swallowed\
  \ by the salty sea. I walked down again, wondering what the dark side of it was\
  \ like. \n\nI left the lit lanes of Arambol on my dusty scooty with a broken headlight,\
  \ to reach Anjuna, the place my relatives warned me about. The place that promised\
  \ to never return someone, who delved in too deep. Shiva Valley, located right at\
  \ the heart of Anjuna beach, one of the most propitious places for Trance lovers\
  \ all over the world. Light thumping bass, groovy tunes, adrenaline rush and paper\
  \ blots of used acid lying all over the place. Quite close to what my relatives\
  \ described, in layman's words. \n\nAt once, I knew I was at the wrong place, filled\
  \ with thousands of people wearing painted neon-lines across their faces and half\
  \ naked bodies pirouetting to the sounds of what felt like a heart, beating three\
  \ times faster than it should. The only remorse was getting there alone. Even the\
  \ sea, right beside the bedlam had its waves crashing to the rhythm of the musical\
  \ reveries.\n\nWhen I thought it couldn't get worse, a man, with deep blue eyes,\
  \ shining like the sapphire in the earrings that my aunt Tereza once wore, circled\
  \ me and started to dance like a madman. I was flustered, embarrassed at the same\
  \ time, seeing someone dance with so much passion, with me being the crux of his\
  \ performance. \n\nHe saw me and said, \"Would you dance with me?\" At this point,\
  \ the maniac's face turned into the smile of someone who didn't have a care in the\
  \ world. His painted face started to look like that of a child playing with colour\
  \ for the first time. \n\nI didn't even notice my feet grooving to the beat of the\
  \ music I had despised my entire life. I simply looked at him and replied, \"I'm\
  \ already dancing with you.\"  He smiled back and continued. There are ten better\
  \ places in Goa, but the high spirit is what I found here, without even finding."
