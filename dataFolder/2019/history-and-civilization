Text: "Report my trip to Istanbul Turkey\nIstanbul is one of the most beautiful Turkish\
  \ cities and has many tourist places, making it a destination for tourists as it\
  \ enjoys the beauty of nature and scenic views, museums, historical and archaeological\
  \ sites and places to shop Making travel a real pleasure.I started the journey to\
  \ Istanbul when I arrived at Istanbul International Airport famous Ataturk Airport\
  \ has been going to the hotel and there are many hotels and distinctive in Istanbul\
  \ and I chose a hotel in the European part of the site of Booking and Taksim is\
  \ a very vital area and the hotel is distinguished The next morning, the tour began\
  \ by visiting the Sultanahmet Mosque or the Blue Mosque, where the walls are known\
  \ in bfrom 1609 until 1616. The mosque is open for visits from 9 am until evening\
  \ prayer.And then went to the entertainment center Aqua Floria and there you enjoy\
  \ watching fish of different types and sizes swim around you and take pictures beside\
  \ the fish lue. \nThere are things you would not expect in travel just be quiet\
  \ and enjoy\nThe tour is well worth the time of the trip schedule and well deserved,\n\
  \nSea air, sea view, birds are all factors to improve the psychological and change\
  \ the mood!\nSearching for entertainment while providing a positive image of the\
  \ country and society\n\nI do not think that the failure of the Turks to speak Arabic\
  \ or English is a major obstacle to enjoying the trip\nBut on condition that you\
  \ are a good planner and reader for the country before your travel ... and you will\
  \ find someone who speaks Arabic or English a little\nIn the latter I advise you\
  \ to travel where fun and knowledge of the moments we read in the books go yourself\
  \ and discover the splendor of these peoples past and present"
