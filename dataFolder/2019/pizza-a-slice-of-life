Text: "In a river of cheery human faces passing through that tipsily cobbled route,\
  \ my eyes caught his. There was nothing particularly conspicuous about him. His\
  \ scarred downward-cast face and unassuming presence could have been replaced by\
  \ an inanimate object and the rest of the world mightn't have noticed.\n\nAround\
  \ this time last year, the streets of Ottawa were buzzing with the influx of tourists,\
  \ flocking from all over the world towards the annual Tulip Festival. I was one\
  \ of them. Flying from India to Canada for 22 hours straight, I arrived with a sense\
  \ of thrill that successfully made me forget the need for a cup of coffee to avoid\
  \ the infamous jet-lag. Canadian summer felt like my winter back home \u2013 windy,\
  \ chilly and yes, cold too!\n\nThat evening, some friends took me out for food and\
  \ drinks to the most spirited part of the city. Nestled in a bustling alley between\
  \ Irish pubs, Moroccan parlors and Greek restaurants, we visited a local Italian\
  \ diner, stuffing ourselves with delicious pizza even native Italians would\u2019\
  ve been proud of! \n\nWhile my friends lounged lazily against the graffiti\u2019\
  d wall of our hostel, I went exploring. After walking a good few minutes with keen\
  \ eyes, I realized I was in a \u201Cdeveloped\u201D country with far less impoverished\
  \ humans than I'd grown accustomed to. Maybe no one was in need of the slice of\
  \ pizza I was carrying? \n\nJust as I was about to take the warm pizza box back\
  \ to the hotel, I saw him. \n\nSitting on a square piece of cardboard, a man twice\
  \ my size had shrunk himself to avoid touching the freezing and unevenly wet cobblestones.\
  \ His hand wasn\u2019t out, he wasn\u2019t begging \u2013 in fact, his body language\
  \ suggested he was actively trying to avoid the human race altogether. He didn\u2019\
  t look drunk nor high on drugs nor disabled, and he certainly didn\u2019t look like\
  \ he was at the right place. Intrigued by his gnawing mysterious presence, a blip\
  \ in that constant of passers-by, I found myself gravitating toward him cautiously\
  \ and apologetically, yet unwaveringly. \n\n\u201CHi! Would you like some pizza\
  \ if you haven\u2019t eaten? Portion sizes in your country are huge!\u201D\n\nHe\
  \ looked up with a strange expression I had yet to see in my life - a faint mixture\
  \ of skepticism, gratitude and amusement. \n\n\u201CAre you sure?\u201D  \n\n\u201C\
  Absolutely!\u201D\n\nAnd he stretched his arm out hesitatingly to reach for the\
  \ box, with the tiniest hint of a smile. \n\n\u201CYou\u2019re not from around here,\
  \ I can tell from your accent. Where are you from? \u201D, he said between mouthfuls\
  \ of pizza.\n\n\u201CIndia. A long way from here\u201D, I said, laughing at the\
  \ thought of how time-consuming my journey had been. \n\nAfter a few minutes of\
  \ small talk in the crispy Canadian air, I gathered the nerve to ask him about how\
  \ he'd reached this particular spot - physically & metaphorically. The conversation\
  \ that ensued is one I won\u2019t forget for a long time. \n\nWhile people stared\
  \ at us edgily, he opened up and traced out his life for me - his impressive education\
  \ and prestigious job in coding, the discovery of a malignant tumor and the subsequent\
  \ Butterfly Effect on his life. From losing his family to the loss of his most socially-rewarded\
  \ motor skills; from adventurous camping in Alaska to the torn tiny bag his worldly\
  \ belongings now fit in - he miraculously still hadn't given up hope. We even discovered\
  \ a shared love of poetry! Soon, his embarrassment gave way to vulnerability and\
  \ his spirit moved me. In his insightful stories I saw shades of every poverty-stricken\
  \ person I'd ever come across back home. \n\nWalking back alone to the hostel, looking\
  \ at the festively-lit Parliament Hill and lovers walking down the canal with tulip\
  \ stalks, all I could feel was gratitude for that fleeting encounter and beautiful\
  \ human connection - like between old friends from different worlds. In a foreign\
  \ land, my humbled mind had journeyed beyond his defenses and traversed into his\
  \ inner world. The night felt warmer as I went on to join my friends. A simple experience\
  \ had become a spiritual one.\n\nOnly later did I realize, that lost in conversation,\
  \ we hadn't even asked each other's names. But did that really matter?"
