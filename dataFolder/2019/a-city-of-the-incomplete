Text: "I've been working as a volunteer in Germany for six months already. I help\
  \ refugees from north Africa and middle east in a school where they complete the\
  \ two years of studying before getting an \"Ausbildung\", a technical carreer where\
  \ they study and work, their way into the german system, which means safety, prosperity,\
  \ opportunities, or at least that is the way it seems.\n\nI work in Freiburg, the\
  \ \"southest\" city on Germany, it proudly holds the title of the sunniest and warmest\
  \ city in this country. Wheater is an important issue that makes the immigrants\
  \ that come from the south stay in Freiburg because they are used to the heat and\
  \ they can't bear the german winter. Also me, coming from the cold mountains of\
  \ Bolivia, I've found the beauty of this city most of all in the nature that surrounds\
  \ the city, the Black Forest. This forest is beautiful in winter and summer, changing\
  \ colors from time to time, always mantaining mistery and staying in peace. \n\n\
  Freiburg mighr be the best kept secret of Germany, it is actually not as big as\
  \ the main cities in Germany, but the landscapes and the enviromental and academic\
  \ achievements of Freiburg have gotten many people interested in this place. There's\
  \ a lot of people coming to Freiburg each year, the newcomers create an unbalanced\
  \ housing situation, there is just not enough place for  all these new people. Finding\
  \ a place to live in Freiburg is a hard task, in deed.\n\nThis newcomers in Freiburg\
  \ are the main carachter of my story, not only the immigrants, I talk mostly about\
  \ the refugees that get in Freiburg. These days, european media can't write news\
  \ with the word \"refugees\" if the word \"crisis\" is not near, it is one of the\
  \ most important topics in the german and european society. This event is causing\
  \ a variety of effects on the german society, mainly because there are many types\
  \ of refugees here.\n\nMany of them are already part of the german way of living,\
  \ they speak fluid german, they celebrate german holidays and they listen to \"\
  Deutschrap\". Many of them have fit in this place. Here many cultures live together,\
  \ youth german culture is quite flexible. A bunch of different ideas are influencing\
  \ themselves at the same time. \n\nBut there other cases, where people just can't\
  \ manage to get into this wheel. And it is not about speed, it is about finding\
  \ so many things strange, it is about a lenguage that resumes the way people think,\
  \ the strictly logical construction of saying things as they look or they are, with\
  \ no further appreciation. \n\nThe way things work and the way the things are called\
  \ is somethinf I get frecuently asked when I help in the german class, and most\
  \ of the time I don't have any right answer. And many times there are no explanations\
  \ at all. Most of the teacher would often say \"Das ist Deutschland\", that is germany\
  \ and this is the way things are, no further explanation, no further appreciation\
  \ of the things.\n\nNevertheless, the refugees situation is not something we can\
  \ simplify and evoid explanations. There is no way to do a diagnosis by finding\
  \ just a couple symtomps. Every case is particular, the stories of these travelers\
  \ is unique for each one. Managing their situation case by case is somethong monumentaly\
  \ big, but making each person just a number and an adress is also a risky choice.\
  \ \n\nLeaving everything, having nothing, comtemplate all the opportunities. Going\
  \ for everything. We all loose so much when we get here. We become children, struggling\
  \ to talk and to figure out things, feeling lost but curious at the same time, feeling\
  \ scared when we find ourselves alone. \n\nUnderstanding this people is not easy,\
  \ how can we get to know them all? All the things they have lived, how can I imagine?\
  \ They have so much to say, and while I am understanding more I feel like loosing\
  \ questions I have to ask left. \n\nThis is a long trip, a marathon of daily discoveries.\
  \ The changes are more important than the information, learning is more important\
  \ than answers. Listening is more important than asking."
