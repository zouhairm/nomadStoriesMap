Text: "The Taj Mahal is the most iconic landmark in India and it attracts nearly two\
  \ million visitors every year. However, there\u2019s lots more to the historic Taj\
  \ City than just this majestic ivory-white mausoleum. Here are the best things to\
  \ see and do in Agra, beyond the Taj Mahal.\nAgra has a rich history and reminders\
  \ of this are spread throughout the city. One of the finest historical sites is\
  \ the 16th century Agra Fort, which is reminiscent of the Mughal era. A Unesco World\
  \ Heritage Site, the fort is built using red sandstone and beautified with inlay\
  \ work in white marble. Inside the fort lies stunning structures, like Khas Mahal,\
  \ Jahangiri Mahal, Shish Mahal, Diwan-e-khaas, Diwan-e-aam, Moti Masjid  and Nagina\
  \ Masjid, which are truly mesmerizing. Another striking fort is the Sikandra Fort\
  \ that lures visitors in with its stunning architecture, which is a blend of Hindu\
  \ and Muslim styles, intricate carvings and exquisite marble work. The tomb of a\
  \ powerful Mughal Emperor, Akbar, also resides in this fort.\nThere are two tombs\
  \ that were built before the Taj Mahal, Akbar\u2019s Tomb and theTomb of I\u2019\
  tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah, but both are often overshadowed by it. Beautifully preserved,\
  \ the tombs are historical and architectural marvels that provide an insight into\
  \ the bygone era. Spread over a sprawling 119 acres of land in Sikandra, Akbar\u2019\
  s Tomb contains the remains of the Mughal Emperor, Akbar. Speaking of the design\
  \ aesthetics, the tomb is a four-tiered pyramid made of deep red sandstone and enhanced\
  \ with white marble, intricate carvings and calligraphic and floral designs. Just\
  \ a stone\u2019s away from Akbar\u2019s Tomb lies another tomb, the Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani\
  \ (wife of Emperor Akbar and mother of Jahangir).\nAnother tomb worth visiting is\
  \ the Tomb of I\u2019tim\u0101d-ud-Daulah, which is an antithesis to the characteristics\
  \ of Mughal architecture. It was the first mausoleum to be built out of white marble\
  \ instead of red sandstone (this exemplifies Mughal architecture). Also called \u2018\
  Baby Taj\u2019, the tomb has been built with the same cut-out stonework (Pietra\
  \ dura) and elaborate carvings as the Taj Mahal. A particularly appealing feature\
  \ is the 13 metre-tall hexagonal towers at each corner of the structure. Surrounded\
  \ by beautiful gardens, this mausoleum is an equally opulent structure that oozes\
  \ beauty from every corner.\n\nJama Masjid\n\nBuilt in 1648 by Mughal Emperor, Shah\
  \ Jahan, Jama Masjid, also called Jami Masjid, is one of the largest mosques in\
  \ the country. This majestic red sandstone mosque took six years to complete and\
  \ can accommodate over 25,000 devotees at any given time. It is an impressive architectural\
  \ masterpiece with intricate white marble decorations, four towering minarets and\
  \ a stunning courtyard adorned with high arches. Also, there are several chattris\
  \ over the sanctuary, which add to its appeal. \n\nThe Mehtab Bagh\n\nTo the north\
  \ of the Taj Mahal lies the picturesque Mehtab Bagh, which is a four garden (char\
  \ bagh) complex. Nestled on the embankment of the Yamuna River, the garden is home\
  \ to a wide variety of plant species. Its crowning glory is its breathtaking view\
  \ of the Taj Mahal from the garden, especially during sunrise and sunset \u2013\
  \ it\u2019s a sight to remember!\n\nThe Taj Nature Walk\n\nSituated approximately\
  \ 500 metres from the east gate of the Taj Mahal, the Taj Nature Walk is a serene\
  \ and quiet 173-acre park that features beautiful walking trails, watchtowers and\
  \ rest spots. The highlight of the park is its glorious vista of the majestic Taj\
  \ Mahal from different angles. Also, while wandering through the park, you\u2019\
  re likely to encounter beautiful birds, such as hoopoes, peacock and more. There\
  \ is an entry fee of INR 100 ($1.56) for foreign national and of INR 20 for Indians.\n\
  \nFatehpur Sikri\n\nAn hour west of Agra lies the historic city of Fatehpur Sikri.\
  \ Founded by Akbar, it was once the capital of the Mughal Empire but was abandoned\
  \ following a water shortage in the region. Today, the city is home to several ancient\
  \ structures, waiting to be explored. Highlights include the 55-metre tall Buland\
  \ Darwaza, the Tomb of Salim Chishti, the Panch Mahal, the Elephant Tower (Hiran\
  \ Minar) and Birbal\u2019s house."
