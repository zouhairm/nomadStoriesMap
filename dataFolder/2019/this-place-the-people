Text: "We\u2019d stolen only a handful of moments alone together when I agreed to\
  \ follow him home. He came from Monterosso, a medieval town in Calabria, and I travelled\
  \ all day on three different trains to get down to the toe of the boot. Now, one\
  \ hand holding his cigarette out the window, the other steering, he drives us up\
  \ the mountain, winding closer towards my first glimpse of his tiny hilltop town.\n\
  \n\u2018This place, the people, it is a little bit strange.\u2019 \n\nHe chooses\
  \ his words carefully and rounds them off with a nervous smile. \n\nHe once said\
  \ he knew why I liked him; because he wasn\u2019t like other Italians. And it was\
  \ true. In all my visits to his country, I\u2019d never met anyone quite like Piero.\n\
  \nHis gold and blue features are rare in the south, but it wasn\u2019t this that\
  \ I fell for. It was his dreams for the world and his place within it. They were\
  \ of change, equality and peace.\n\nHe wants to share with me that which has shaped\
  \ him and the people who\u2019ve raised him. For several weeks we swap languages\
  \ and stories, music and sides of the bed. We cook, we eat, we walk. Hand in hand,\
  \ between stone houses and up and down stairs, ducking under strings of clothes.\
  \ We are greeted again and again. A wave, a smile, a car horn sounded twice. The\
  \ men prepare porcini for me, the women buy me gifts. I am the girl from the other\
  \ side of the world, here with their favourite son.\n\n\u2018But you know, really,\
  \ I am alone,\u2019 he tells me one day. \u2018There is no one here who understands.\u2019\
  \n\nHe is a young man bursting with aspirations, born in a town without work, no\
  \ money to leave, and far too much time to think. In this region, the unemployment\
  \ rate is one of the worst in Europe. Choking and disintegrating under the power\
  \ of the \u2018Ndrangheta, Monterosso offers glorious vistas of what exists beyond,\
  \ but Piero is trapped within its crumbling walls and the narrow views of its people\
  \ who have never left. \n\nFor those who want to escape, the motorways leading out\
  \ of the south have been construction zones for decades and the rail lines are slow.\
  \ They are a manifestation of embezzled government funds and a reminder that escape\
  \ is not easy. And so, the people of Monterosso, despite their warmth, and unwavering\
  \ devotion to each other and their town, live an insular existence where home is\
  \ everything and there is nothing more to do than raise children who think the same.\
  \ \n\nTime after time, when most have staggered home, Piero finds someone willing\
  \ to share one last drink and cigarette. Their conversation slips into dialect and\
  \ while I can\u2019t always catch their words in the clouds of smoke, I know Piero\
  \ is telling them of his travels and the life he\u2019s tasted, the opportunities\
  \ he\u2019s seen, and what they too can have if they only try.\n\nOn our final evening\
  \ together, wrapped in scarves and a veil of red wine, we sit with the group of\
  \ friends who have come to accept me as one of their own. Amidst the laughter, I\
  \ see Piero wiping tears from his eyes.\n\n\u2018Why?\u2019 I ask. \n\n\u2018You.\
  \ Here. With my friends, in my strange little town. It\u2019s a wonderful, magical\
  \ thing.\u2019\n\nI squeeze his hand because I have no words. Our bond is true,\
  \ but deep down we both know his tears are not of happiness. He is tethered to this\
  \ place by a force stronger than I, one that outsiders may never fully understand,\
  \ and I am leaving him behind."
