Text: "Unlinke anywhere I have ever been, the twinkling streets were a chaos of activity,\
  \ people with unique missions and aromas of delicious food. The street markets were\
  \ abuzz with unique merchandise and the quality of the street food was Michelin\
  \ star like. Yet, amongst all this chaos, beautiful gardens were just a short train\
  \ ride away. I have never felt so much peace before and you can hardly imagine that\
  \ it\u2019s just a 10 minute train ride away, right in the city the most peaceful\
  \ gardens to stroll through and meditate. The privilege of visiting ancient temples\
  \ is something that North Americans lack and Japan granted this privilege to me\
  \ for the shirt time I was there. I began all my days with a visit to a temple or\
  \ a walk to a shrine, humming positivities, taking in all the red that decorated\
  \ the temples. I was enchanted by the bells, the lanterns and the gold leafed diety\
  \ structures. The temple markets served as excellent souvenir shopping spots far\
  \ away from the city and sold authentic Japanese artifacts and food that I munched\
  \ on as I made my way through the temple. \nI have been explaing Tokyo so far, but\
  \ Japan distracted me with Kyoto long before Tokyo had become familiar to me. Kyoto\
  \ was a beautiful juxtaposition of the new and the old. There are cobbled stone\
  \ streets that traditional Japanese clothing clad locals stroll through going about\
  \ their business. There were many photo shoots witnessed by me alone on my way up\
  \ to the shrine. A lady with a red parasol caught my eye and I followed her photo\
  \ shoot around for a while. My walk included delicious fried hot treats and sticky\
  \ rice balls on a stick soaked in a sweet sauce. The tea shops are magical and food\
  \ options numerous. It seems like the whole world found it\u2019s way to Kyoto.\
  \ It\u2019s traditional and small but the little bamboo alley ways prove otherwise.\
  \ The civilization exists deep inside these alleys, living deep inside in peace\
  \ far away from the touristy chaos of the main street. \n\nSolo travel should be\
  \ experienced by us all. I\u2019m Japan, where I didn\u2019t know the language,\
  \ I felt more sure of myself than I ever had. I was content in my own company and\
  \ my favourite experience was munching on high quality beef within a futuristic\
  \ part of Tokyo. I will go back again."
