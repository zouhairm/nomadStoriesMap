Text: "\u201CKNOCK KNOCK\u201D, I awoke startled and disoriented to loud banging on\
  \ the door.  Where was I? What was happening?  The voice on the other side of the\
  \ hotel door urged, \u201CMaam everyone must get out of the building.\u201D  \n\n\
  \u201CMaam?\u201D  I always hated being called, \u201CMaam\u201D it makes me feel\
  \ so old. I looked at my phone what time was it?   4:10 AM.  Nooo, it had been less\
  \ than two hours since the last earthquake tremor and I had JUST gotten to sleep.\
  \ Staggering to find my way in the dark, I blindly walked towards the voice and\
  \ opened the door.  With a solemn expression on my face.  I sheepishly looked at\
  \ the dark-skinned man before me.  His body visibly trembling. With a thick Indonesian\
  \ accent, he repeated himself albeit with a quivering voice, \u201CYou need to leave\
  \ the building NOW\u201D  \u201COK.\u201D I managed to mumble.\n\nHaving grown up\
  \ in Southern California I wasn\u2019t new to earthquakes but seeing the large cracks\
  \ in the walls around me and dust scattered down the hallway told me this was far\
  \ more serious than anything I\u2019d ever experienced before.  Would this building\
  \ crumble to the ground?  Does my world nomad travel insurance cover this natural\
  \ disaster? I pushed the dreaded thoughts out of my monkey mind.  I must appear\
  \ strong for my daughter. \n\nJust hours ago Zoe and I were giddy about our plans\
  \ to celebrate her 16th birthday on the island of Gili Air, a small island in Indonesia.\
  \   No motorized cars allowed.  I imagined riding bicycles around the island with\
  \ our basket filled with tropical fruits, a beach blanket, and snorkel gear.  Swimming\
  \ with whale sharks and manta rays was all I could keep thinking about ~ up to this\
  \ moment, anyway.\n\nHours before our fast boat was canceled due to high seas. We\
  \ had no choice but to take the dreaded six-hour ferry boat, called the \u201CIron\
  \ Miracle,\u201D built over 35 years ago.  Its condition screamed it should have\
  \ been retired years ago and I thought it truly would be a \u201Cmiracle\u201D if\
  \ it didn\u2019t sink. The smell, rancid with the pungency of urine and puke permeated\
  \ my nostrils, yet, had I known what fate would have waited for me If I had caught\
  \ that fast boat I would not be complaining.\n\nGili Air was hit with a 7.0 in magnitude\
  \ earthquake which killed over 563 people, injuring 1,000 more.  Still not knowing\
  \ the severity of what was happening just a few miles away, Zoe in the midst of\
  \ people panicking and screaming convinced a bus driver with her broken Indonesian\
  \ to take us collectively to a hotel in the next town over which we hoped was safer.\n\
  \nI looked around in a sea of predominantly Muslim people all lining the streets\
  \ staying clear of any shaking buildings.  Most wearing robe-like dresses.  The\
  \ women wearing a hijab, a scarf covering their head, neck, and shoulders. I felt\
  \ surely out of place. This was certainly not the white sand beaches I had been\
  \ longing for.  However,  it was during these long hours while we waited that I\
  \ met a local woman, Liya, who openly shared with me about her culture as her two\
  \ small children lay sleeping on the trembling asphalt next to her.  She shared\
  \ about her life and opened my eyes to a very different culture than my beach town\
  \ upbringing.\n\nWhen the street lights turned back on I offered to help Liya return\
  \ home a few miles away.  The four of us piled onto her scooter. I handed Zoe my\
  \ water, a bag of wasabi peas, and cash telling her I\u2019d be back as soon as\
  \ possible. It was through the chaos and unfortunate circumstances that I was able\
  \ to for the first time sit with a Muslim woman and exchange stories of our different\
  \ lives. It was compassion that tied us together even if our religions did not.\n\
  \nMidnight struck and myself and those around me broke out in a song of Happy Birthday\
  \ for Zoe. I looked around, getting out of my comfort zone was surely the driving\
  \ force that kept me traveling and this was certainly one of those times."
