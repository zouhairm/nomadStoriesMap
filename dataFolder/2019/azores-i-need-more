Text: "In the land of exuberant vegetation, abundant wildlife, intricate vineyards\
  \ filled with lava rocks, and the vibrant souls of many people is the island of\
  \ Terceira, just 9,000 miles off the coast of Portugal. Two months prior, I had\
  \ never heard of the Azores archipelago, an open-ended mystery I was ready to dive\
  \ into and explore. I knew nothing, except that my flight was leaving from Boston,\
  \ Massachusetts near midnight and I would arrive just at the break of morn. I had\
  \ traveled to the Dead Sea and hiked the stairs of Masada, I have been into to the\
  \ reefs of Belize, graced my eyes with the scenery of Switzerland, but Terceira\
  \ trumped all the rest. As the plane landed I reckoned precise squares placed amongst\
  \ the island and evidently cows, everywhere, near the plane runway. This was captivating,\
  \ an anomaly in itself because the inhabitants of the Azores cultivated their own\
  \ land and wildlife as their own. Over the course of eight days, I emerged myself\
  \ into the bare necessities of the local inhabitants, perplexed and amazed that\
  \ this is an obtainable lifestyle. I have found my haven, this is the place I have\
  \ been searching for all along. I knew not a soul that has experienced this type\
  \ of magic, but here I was, unfathomably existing in the presence of pure perfection.\
  \ From all corners of the island, I was always craving more. Angra do Hermoiso was\
  \ lined with cobblestone paths, vibrant colored buildings, and the most obscure\
  \ artistry that never cease to amaze. The pier, lined with yachts and boats, attracted\
  \ sunlight, people and the most glorious fish. Praia da Vit\xF3ria had similar,\
  \ enticing features but it was here I emerged into a cultural love, American soccer.\
  \ As I sat at a bar, drinking the island local beer, Super Bok, I watched island\
  \ natives scurry to the small beach hoisting up a large screen. Within no time the\
  \ World Cup was being played live and I emerged in the cheering, laughter and occasional\
  \ uproars when a poor call was made. It was in this moment I realized that it did\
  \ not matter if anyone knew one another when a common love is shared, love is shared\
  \ on this island. Biscoitos holds my heart forever because it graced me with a self-revelation\
  \ that I needed at this moment in my life. From the natural pools surrounded by\
  \ configurations of remnants of a volcanic explosion, the depths of caves (where\
  \ there should be the Jurassic Park soundtrack playing as you enter), to the top\
  \ of a hill where a massive cross stood, blessing the island for all of its natural\
  \ glory. Words cannot suffice the magnificence of the island natural beauty, but\
  \ Biscoitos held something more. As I sat in the home of an island native, opening\
  \ her home to make authentic Portuguese food, my family and I gathered around a\
  \ large table. Reminiscing on events that happened just hours before over win, blood\
  \ sausage, patata fritas, sweet potatoes, and the most creamy cheesecake I have\
  \ ever consumed, we were together sharing a commonality of pure amazement. As I\
  \ harassed the waiter, or the son of the household, asking a thousand questions\
  \ about the food, his life, the language, the culture, and everything in between,\
  \ I realized my curiosity was never going to dim. Asking these questions filled\
  \ my soul and ignited an even bigger question to follow. It felt like I was in the\
  \ pursuit to build a puzzle, but there is always a missing piece and I have to find\
  \ it. Question after question he looks at me and laughs muttering the simple phrase\
  \ that has been engraved into my mind, \"you will never know, Miss\". This small\
  \ island held so much heart, love and unknown, but this is just a portion of what\
  \ the mainland, Portugal, is. No matter where I go, I am never satisfied because\
  \ my curiosity propels me into adventure, situations beyond my comfort, and ignites\
  \ my love for the world's complex, enticing differences."
