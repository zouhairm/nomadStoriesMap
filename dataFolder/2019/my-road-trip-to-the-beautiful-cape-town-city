Text: "My journey allowed me to be in the wonderful city called the Cape Town, South\
  \ Africa.\n\nMy first thought about this place was how in the world did they get\
  \ to conclude that this is actually a Lion's head, is it something that is man-made\
  \ or nature made? Being in Cape Town for the few days that I had planned, I sure\
  \ knew a lot was to be seen and experimented.\n\nOn the first day after arriving\
  \ at the Cape Town International airport was that I never thought it actually looked\
  \ like how they described it in the pictures. This place is rich and filled with\
  \ so much livelihood. Get welcomed by locals teaching you how and what to see and\
  \ when to see the beautiful land.\n\nThe hotel that I had stayed at has over 483\
  \ guest rooms to choose from, I would love to believe I had chosen the best one\
  \ as it directly faces the beautiful sea. The magnificent view was just beyond what\
  \ I would say living the dream.\n\nDuring my stay here I should say I have seen\
  \ what people have been bragging about and wanting to explore mostly. Take a leap\
  \ of faith and go hiking up the table Mountain, and obviously don\u2019t forget\
  \ to take a jersey with you as it is cold up there and as you get there don't be\
  \ shocked as you literally see the whole city from just a mere look down there.\n\
  \nCape town is commonly known to have more coloured race population then any other\
  \ race. Take a trip down some of the townships, there is a lot to see and maybe\
  \ a lot to learn from. With so many cities to choose from and enjoy the support\
  \ and company. Be sure to ask the locals what really makes this place a beautiful\
  \ place and be shocked at what you can find.\n\nThere are a couple of activities\
  \ you may be willing to feature in. Try either hiking, scuba diving or just some\
  \ history walks and indulge yourself in some of the most delicious well-prepared\
  \ restaurants near you. For the first timers visiting this magnificent place in\
  \ Cape Town be sure to visit one of the 20 best places to see and experience. Chapman\u2019\
  s peak, Table mountain, Yours truly, Kalk Bay, the V&A waterfront, Camps bay, 4Roomed\
  \ Ekhasi culture, Muizenberg, Franschhoek wine tram, Boulders beach, Wembley road\
  \ house, Cape point, Zeita Mocca and the Silo district, The Bo-Kaap, Blouberg beachfront.\
  \ The sea point promenade, Oranjezicht city farm market, Groot constantia.\n\nSuch\
  \ places are for people to see and believe with by themselves whilst also having\
  \ fun. It is a home away from home and a definite culture worth exploring. Gold\
  \ chains and leather shoes are a common culture style for us the Cape Tonians that\
  \ is what they call themselves here. See us in one of those shiny million coloured\
  \ shirt strips, we know we are trending for the right reasons.\n\nWhat haven\u2019\
  t you tried and wished to try? Metrorail and some township experience, some chicken\
  \ feet or chicken intestines and then come back to me and let me know how that went.\
  \ A lot of people are sceptical about trying such things and at the end of trying\
  \ they actually want to eat some more and experience it again.\nDriving through\
  \ the Chapman\u2019s peak is one amazing route as you get to see the magnificent\
  \ sea which is approximately 9km along South Africa\u2019s Atlantic coast. We left\
  \ the restaurant and our trip beyond the country road and between paddocks were\
  \ ringed by log fences, whilst admiring the very nature it has given us.\n\nI must\
  \ confess that being in this place is really something I definitely needed and would\
  \ say come and experience as I don\u2019t believe that there could be any other\
  \ area like this one. One of the most interesting things about this place is its\
  \ friendly people, speak to anyone and engage in a debate of any and see the passion\
  \ that comes from them. The joy of seeing people live like they free is soothing\
  \ for another.\n\nA good way to return and come and experience the adventure and\
  \ the people again."
