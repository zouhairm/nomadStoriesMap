Text: "As I swing back and forth on a multi-colored, rope hammock with the ocean breeze\
  \ whipping the white capped, crested waves toward the shore, I hear the laughter\
  \ of my classmates\u2014from Loras College in Dubuque, Iowa\u2014in the distance\
  \ as we all enjoy the warmth of Belize. \n\nBack home, the snow and cold are awaiting\
  \ our return.\n\nLooking back on the adventure of understanding Belizean culture\
  \ thus far, I contemplate what we have learned: how the people of this country interconnect\
  \ and how we all communicate with one another.  For instance, I have learned that\
  \ the Creole language is the foundation of the whole country, and in fact it is\
  \ indeed the glue that holds Belize together; however, the culture of Belize is\
  \ much more than just language.  What has stood out to me the most is the emphasis\
  \ on the non-material\u2014the welcoming we receive from Belizeans at each place\
  \ that my classmates and I have traveled to, their hospitality, joy, enthusiasm\
  \ and willingness to teach our group their traditions, and by sharing their stories\
  \ with us.\n\nNow glancing toward the horizon, the sun has finally peeked out from\
  \ behind the clouds\u2014 sailboat in the distance.  Yesterday, school children\
  \ welcomed us at Coconut Row in Hopkins with traditional Garifuna singing and dancing.\
  \  Afterward, I was politely asked to dance and our entire group moved to the beat\
  \ of the drums on a happy whim.  The boys and girls are energetic and just as curious\
  \ to know where we live as we are to learn about them.  They are passionate about\
  \ sharing their personalities and excitement with us just as the instructors at\
  \ the Living Maya Experience were about teaching us how to make the similar kind\
  \ of hammock that I am currently sitting in.  Though, I cannot fathom how they started\
  \ to learn the ways and nuances of each plant and animal in the jungle.\n\nZipping\
  \ through the twists and turns of the river, the boat we took to get there has finally\
  \ reached Lamanai. Exploring and climbing up the colossal steps, this experience\
  \ and the entire trip leaves me in awe of my surroundings.  I am fascinated by the\
  \ entire process of how they built these ancient ruins.  As my classmate Betsy states,\
  \ we are \u201Cexploring a world that I couldn\u2019t even imagine!\u201D\n\nWhether\
  \ the experience has been having a conversation with a Belizean, watching the scenery\
  \ whiz by on the bus rides, petting a jaguar at the Belize Zoo, learning the daily\
  \ life of students while teaching them a lesson in division and pronouns, or hiking\
  \ to the Bocawina waterfall to fall\u2014rappel\u2014into its basin, the culture\
  \ of Belize is so much more than just a tourist destination. The people of Belize\
  \ show their vibrant passion through their way of life that goes at its own pace.\
  \ So, listen to the stories and soak in as much as possible. Enjoy the colorful\
  \ atmosphere that is Belize."
