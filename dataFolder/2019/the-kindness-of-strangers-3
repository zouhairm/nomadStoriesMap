Text: "We raced frantically down the narrow train aisles, our over-sized packs almost\
  \ clobbering several passengers. Finally, we found the ticket inspector, whose shiny\
  \ black shoes and burgundy uniform made him distinguishable from other travellers.\
  \ An older gentleman with grey hair, he looked intently through the glasses balanced\
  \ on his nose at the small tablet cradled in his aging hand. \n\u201CCan you help\
  \ us?\u201D pleaded Mahn\xE9e, my travel companion and best friend. \nThen speaking\
  \ a mile-a-minute, she explained our plight.\n\nThe train was meant to take us from\
  \ the Roma Termini to Leonardo da Vinci Airport, marking the end of our five-week\
  \ escapade through Western Europe. However, the voiceover indicated that the train\
  \ was headed to Milan, far from where we needed to be. We had a 4pm flight from\
  \ Rome to Sri Lanka so that we could attend a wedding. Missing our flight could\
  \ mean missing the wedding!\n\nThe train inspector scrolled through his tablet for\
  \ what seemed like an eternity.\n\u201CSee here,\u201D he said, his accent thick.\
  \ \u201CYou miss change.\u201D \nHe extended the tablet toward us, his wrinkled\
  \ finger pointing to the train we should have been on. No one told us about the\
  \ change when we asked for help back at Roma Termini. The panic on our faces must\
  \ have been clear because the inspector immediately took out his mobile phone, which\
  \ resembled an indestructible Nokia from the 2000s. \nHe conversed loudly in Italian,\
  \ then hung up and said, \u201CTwo hours. Next train two hours.\u201D \nIt was past\
  \ 2pm. The situation began to look dire. \n\u201CMaybe there\u2019s a bus or taxi\
  \ we can catch?\u201D Mahn\xE9e wondered aloud. \n\nAs we pulled into the next station,\
  \ a young man with dark hair and eyes stepped forward to disembark. He looked to\
  \ be in his mid-twenties like us, and wore running shoes and a backpack with his\
  \ shorts and t-shirt. The inspector spoke briefly with him, then turned to us and\
  \ explained apologetically that this man would help us.\n\nThe heat hit me like\
  \ a hairdryer blast as we exited the air-conditioned train. The sign on the tiny\
  \ platform read \u201CTarquinia\u201D, which a quick search revealed was 79km north\
  \ of the airport. As we followed the young man out of the station, Mahn\xE9e desperately\
  \ tried to rectify the situation. \n\u201CWill you please drive us to the airport?\
  \ We will pay you!\u201D she implored. \nSeemingly amused by Mahn\xE9e\u2019s resolve\
  \ the stranger smiled, my fears of following a possible axe murderer settled by\
  \ his warmth. \n\u201CI only have a bike,\u201D the young man explained in near\
  \ perfect English. \u201CThere is only a bus from the station to the town, but someone\
  \ there might know more.\u201D \nHe wished us luck and walked away. We were left\
  \ alone in the middle of nowhere. It was 2:15pm.\n\nAfter many minutes, the arrival\
  \ of a large blue bus caused us to quickly scramble from our spots on the dusty\
  \ ground. The doors opened, revealing a plump, middle-aged woman. \n\u201C60 cents,\u201D\
  \ she stated, eyeing our stressed faces and heavy packs. \nWe paid the money, then\
  \ proceeded to make a spectacle of ourselves as we unloaded our saga on this poor\
  \ woman and all her bus passengers. She handed Mahn\xE9e her phone and cited a number\
  \ for a local taxi that may be able to drive us. Once again, Mahn\xE9e emphatically\
  \ relayed a now well-rehearsed story, but to no avail. Everyone disembarked in town.\
  \ People asked what they could do for us, called people they knew and tried to help.\
  \ Never before had I encountered so many people in one day who would help strangers.\
  \ \n\nEventually, having exhausted all options, we took the bus back to the station.\
  \ The driver pitied us and let us ride for free. We trudged onto the deserted platform,\
  \ drained of hope. As we watched 4pm tick by, I reflected on the past two hours\
  \ and my newfound belief in the kindness of strangers."
