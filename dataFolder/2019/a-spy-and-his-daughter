Text: "'My father used to be a spy here'.\n\nThese are the first words she says to\
  \ me. We're standing at the entrance to the Stasi Museum in Lichtenberg, just on\
  \ the outskirts of central Berlin. The outside of the building is unremarkable;\
  \ you'd never know that one of the largest and most repressive spy missions in Europe\
  \ was orchestrated within the brown walls in front of me. I guess that's the point.\
  \ \n\n\n'Well, not here, ja, but in the DDR. He was forced to\u2019. \n\n\nI had\
  \ been standing outside the building alone when she approached me, seeking a brief\
  \ respite after 5 hours inside trawling through photos and information boards jam-packed\
  \ with text. I look at her somewhat incredulously as I reply. 'Oh. Um, really? You\
  \ mean he was a Stasi man?'\n\n\n'Genau. Yes. I'm Christa, by the way. I was just\
  \ dropping off some papers'. \n\n\nI introduce myself to Christa and immediately\
  \ begin probing her on her fathers history. I have never had much tact for discretion\
  \ and my questions are more upfront than I would usually like, but Christa is kind\
  \ and her generous answers bolster my confidence. Her words are peppered with confusion\
  \ and mixed emotion about the history of her country. As I try to conceal my shivers\
  \ and the shade of blue starting to creep over my knuckles, Christa offers to continue\
  \ the conversation with a drink in a local bar where we'll be surrounded by cheap\
  \ beers and heating. Who can refuse?\n\n\nThe winter sun falls behind blocks of\
  \ identical apartments as we walk along Frankfurter Allee. The buildings are imposingly\
  \ large and overbearing, an accurate portrayal of the ideology they were designed\
  \ to reflect. Christa tells me about the current political climate in Berlin; about\
  \ how there are more individuals sympathetic to certain aspects of the old East\
  \ German regime than expected, about the differences between Berlin and the 'rest'\
  \ of Germany, and about the small pockets of the city that have seen a recent swell\
  \ in anti-immigration protest. Not for the first time today, I look at her in shock.\n\
  \n\n'Really? Here in Berlin?'. I had spent the past few days reflecting almost hourly\
  \ on Berlin\u2019s now celebrated and established culture of diversity.\n\n\n'Ja,\
  \ of course. They are still overwhelmed by their opposition, but they are slowly...um...climbing.\
  \ It\u2019s very dangerous'.\n\n\nI ponder this for a second and wonder if the concern\
  \ for the steady growth that Christa speaks of is perhaps amplified by her deep\
  \ connection to the politics of this country's past. The persistent cries of my\
  \ history teacher linger - 'find as many angles of interrogation as possible, then\
  \ take the bat to them'! I start to question Christa again, conscious of my luck\
  \ at this chance connection and desperate to get as much information as possible.\
  \ I ask her to explain the mental mechanics to me - how the Stasi often operated\
  \ to torture their victims by forcing them into situations where they would think\
  \ themselves crazy. \n\n\n'They would come in whilst you were at work and, say,\
  \ move your toaster, or lock your bike to a different post'. She pauses. 'Of course,\
  \ that on it's own is not maybe the worst...sometimes we just have moments of madness.\
  \ But when it happens 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 times...well. You would go insane. They had\
  \ schools to train people in how to do this, how to make you paranoid'. \n\n\nAs\
  \ the night draws on, Christa tells me personal stories; things she knows her father\
  \ did and later, things that were done to her family. I'm repeatedly shocked to\
  \ find myself in her company, and still more shocked to hear her tales shared so\
  \ willingly. Why is the past so much more appealing when it is so visibly attached\
  \ to the present?\n\n\nAlmost 8 hours later and with the promise of another catch\
  \ up before I leave Berlin, I bid Christa farewell with a long hug. Buoyed by beer\
  \ and an overflow of information, I decide to walk home instead of catching the\
  \ train. With my phone clutched between my shivering hands, I text my family back\
  \ home. \u2018I just met the daughter of a real Stasi spy\u2019!"
