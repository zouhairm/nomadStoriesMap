Text: "I haven\u2019t checked the calendar but it\u2019s 7:48pm\nHeavy with layers\
  \ of winter, I shove myself head first into the car. This isn\u2019t even a journey\
  \ \u2013 it\u2019s a long sleep on wheels.\nHeadphones in, Grace Slick singing me\
  \ into a trance and I doze off. This is travel,\nmillennial adventurer edition.\n\
  \nStill in a trance, 3:07am\nIstanbul, I blend with you slowly, into your tea-flavored\
  \ embrace, into the paradoxical (or\nnot so paradoxical) feeling that I\u2019m finally\
  \ home. My two seas, my Bosphorus. When I\ncrossed it, something inside me broke,\
  \ an umbilical cord of sorts that stretched effortlessly\nthroughout my travels\
  \ across Europe, but became delicate and fragile as soon as I left the\nold continent.\
  \ Now I can be free.\n\nDay 1, New Delhi\nClouds of dust, clothes drying on the\
  \ clouds of dust, they are building a metro, in two years it will be ready and in\
  \ five \u201Cwe will have surpassed the population of China!\u201D(Do the children\
  \ sleeping in the street really count?)\nThe columns of the temple with the name\
  \ of Allah carved on them, ninety-nine times and\nnever a hundred because no earthly\
  \ creation can achieve perfection. The dead are buried\nseven feet in the ground,\
  \ that is where the entryway to paradise begins. They are buried\nnaked, so that\
  \ the earth can become their shroud.\n\nDay 2, Mandawa\nThe Ganges, or Mother Ganga,\
  \ is the earthly extension of the divine.\nShe starts in heaven and flows down to\
  \ the people to collect our prayers and cleanse our\nsouls.\nThe walls of houses\
  \ in Mandawa are painted to life, like the pages of Ramayana. They too\ntell stories.\
  \ Emperor Akbar married a Hindu princess. Buddha reached enlightenment at\nfour\
  \ in the morning. Me, I was still sleeping.\n\nDay 3 (or rather, night), Jaipur\n\
  Brahma is the creator, Vishnu is the protector, and Shiva \u2013 the destroyer.\
  \ There are hardly\nany images of Brahma; temples revering Shiva abound \u2013 we\
  \ are the earthly embodiment\nof his element.\nKrishna is a seducer, he has many\
  \ wives and lovers. He is most often seen with Radha.\nHe loves her most of all,\
  \ with all his divine blue heart.\n\nDay 4, Jaipur\nThe Palace of Winds is a lavish\
  \ honeycomb of red and pink sandstone erected to shelter\nthe queen and other ladies\
  \ of the court from the prying eyes of the crowd, while allowing them to\nobserve\
  \ everyday life. A monument to voyeurism, romanticized by the royal fascination\
  \ only those living in democracies can harbor.\nTo impress a bored Prince Albert,\
  \ the entire town was painted pink. The resulting nickname is still fitting, as\
  \ the cotton candy fort continues to grace the arid Rajasthani desert.\n\nDay 5,\
  \ Bharatpur\nA bird sanctuary. The morning chill yanks me out of a trance conjured\
  \ on another\ncontinent. Soon I am running by the trishaw to warm up. A bird on\
  \ a nearby branch begins observing me, likely looking down on my decisively inferior\
  \ means of migration.\n\u201CWhy did we have to come at six in the morning?!?\u201D\
  \ \u2013 I ask.\n\u201CMiss, at nine, the cobras will join\u201D.\n\nDay 6, Agra\n\
  The Taj Mahal. Enough with words, scribbler, don\u2019t try to capture the exaggerated\n\
  grandeur of this monument to the extremity of love and grief.\n\nDay 7, Agra\nEmperor\
  \ Akbar selected the site for his tomb before his death. He planned the\nconstruction\
  \ according to his idea of paradise \u2013 tranquil clear waters and lots of green.\
  \ His\nbody lies in a bare room with whitewashed walls, somewhere underground (seven\
  \ feet?).\nThe acoustic is worthy of an angelic choir. What a waste that no one\
  \ is singing.\nI spent the whole day in the park. I read the initials that lovers\
  \ have carved in the red\nsandstone of a hidden wall. This closeness of love and\
  \ death is captivating, the former\nintrusively vandalizing the quiet perfection\
  \ of the latter.\n\nAnd back\nSuddenly, without noticing, I find myself in Istanbul,\
  \ eating dinner and drinking Italian wine\nin an attempt to mend my connection with\
  \ Europe. A symbolic gesture \u2013 the Turkish one\ntastes better.\n\n* * * * *\n\
  A desert rain chant\nis flooding the Bosphorus\nWhen I turn ninety-nine\nMy life\
  \ will begin"
