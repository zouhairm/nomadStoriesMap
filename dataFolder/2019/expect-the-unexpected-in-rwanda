Text: "I traveled to Rwanda in 2006 to help to some of the poorest people on earth.\
  \  The purpose of the trip was to work in a boys home near Kigali that offers food,\
  \ shelter, and education to street boys that suffer from the continued fallout of\
  \ the horrific genocide that had occurred over a 4 month period in 1994.  I expected\
  \ to find people with a great deal of need that would benefit from the love and\
  \ knowledge that I could bestow upon them.  I expected to help in any way possible;\
  \ teaching basic computer skills, distributing clothing and helping care for the\
  \ boys in the Umuryango Childrens Network home.  I expected to give of myself and\
  \ to be completely outside my comfort zone.\nWhat I found was very different from\
  \ what I expected.  The staff and children of the boys home were very welcoming\
  \ as were the people that lived in the surrounding village.  While most of the people\
  \ were living in very poor subsistance conditions, I found that they were joyful\
  \ and more than willing to share anything that they had to give.  They shared their\
  \ culture, their food and their love freely and unconditionally.  They were people\
  \ of great faith that joyously went about their daily struggle to simply survive\
  \ with limited food, shelter, utilities and resources.\nDuring the second week we\
  \ were there, my wife and I went up to an area of the village that was in the shade\
  \ of a large tree.  The village women gathered at this place during the heat of\
  \ the midday sun to talk, relax and nurse their babies.  None of the village women\
  \ could speak english and we were not able to speak more than a few words of their\
  \ native language, Kinyarwanda making verbal communication very difficult.  Nevertheless,\
  \ we were able to communicate non- verbally through hand signals and the universal\
  \ language of smiling.  As we got comfortable with the group, my wife went to sit\
  \ down in the dried grass and dust with the other women.  As she started to take\
  \ a seat, one of the village women held out her hands in a gesture that clearly\
  \ indicated that they wanted her to wait.  One of the women got up and unwrapped\
  \ her outer skirt revealing an underskirt that appeared to made of an old burlap\
  \ bag.  She proceeded to lay out her outer skirt on the ground to provide a clean\
  \ place for my wife to sit.  Both my wife and I were stunned and impressed by this\
  \ simple act of generosity.  We were beyond humbled by this gesture of sharing what\
  \ was likely her only garment for a guest who had far more that she had.  This simple\
  \ act nearly brought us to tears.  Both my wife and I were taught the real meaning\
  \ of sharing and being a good host.  We saw first hand the sense of community had\
  \ binds a culture that was very different from what we experience at home in the\
  \ United States.\nWhat I expected to find in Rwanda  was poverty and we certainly\
  \ saw this everywhere we went.  What I didn\u2019t expect to learn was the real\
  \ sense of communtity and the generous spirit of a group of people that have so\
  \ little.  I was humbled and embarrassed when I thought about myself and wondered\
  \ if this simple gesture for a visiting stranger would have even crossed my mind\
  \ if the roles had been reversed.  I learned a lot about myself that trip and developed\
  \ an understanding that people everywhere can share moment of peace and understanding\
  \ even if they are unable to communicate verbally.  I also learned that the simplest\
  \ of gestures can have a profound affect on others and change their life.  I owe\
  \ debt of gratitude to the village ladies of a small village in Rwanda.  I visited\
  \ their country expecting to give of myself and found that I received so much more\
  \ than I gave to them.  I have a great respect for the Rwandan people and am envious\
  \ for their generosity and for teaching me how to be a better person."
