Text: "Hello, \nSo I planned my trip to Dubai with 3 of my girl friends. To be honest\
  \ Dubai wasn\u2019t my first go to option but I\u2019m so glad I picked it. So a\
  \ brief of my 5 nights 6 days trip. We were staying at Deira although would suggest\
  \ anyone to stay at Bur Dubai, since most of the happening places are there. Tour\
  \ went something like Dubai - Atlantis - Abu Dhabi and back. First day had a city\
  \ tour where we literally witnessed the different countries benchmarks (not literally)\
  \  like the twin towers in Singapore, the humongous skyscrapers like Newyork and\
  \ so much more, the day ended with us at the dhao cruz. Of course there after we\
  \ went to this \u201Cdesi\u201D club budvoir and danced till we dropped. Next day\
  \ spent at the Jumeirah beach relaxing from where we could see the Burj Al Arab\
  \ probably the only 7star hotel in the world so clearly and then comes the best\
  \ part of my entire trip Atlantis Water park!!! The most fun I ever had. Right from\
  \ the people working there to the rides, loved it all. Also finally got a chance\
  \ to eat at the famous Gordon Ramsay Kitchen right outside. No matter what kind\
  \ of taste you have you will love the food. Also visited the Atlantis Marine museum.\
  \ \nNow come the day at the Abu Dhabi, hands down I was blown away by the infrastructure,\
  \ So spectacular, neat and clean. Visited the most beautiful Sheikh Zayed Mosque.\
  \ I swear I felt I was in heaven. My words won\u2019t do justice to its beauty.\
  \ On our way saw the amazing infrastructure of this place, mesmerised by how huge\
  \ the sheikhs  holiday homes were let alone their own houses! Abu Dhabi. And now\
  \ comes the adventure part of the day \u201CFerrari World\u201D yes you got it right\
  \ which has the worlds fastest roller coster and I sat in it! Followed by other\
  \ amazing rides and of course most of the iconic Ferrari\u2019s for the show. Once\
  \ we were back in Dubai, to complete our ritual as I say, went for a party at the\
  \ club \u201CBaristi\u201D this club is on the beach! Need I say more ? Here comes\
  \ the fourth day, should I say saving the best for the last! \nThe Dubai Mall and\
  \ Iconic Burj khalifa \u201Cat the top\u201D followed by dancing fountains. And\
  \ obviously lots of shopping! Nope you can\u2019t roam the entire mall I\u2019m\
  \ one day like oh my god it is humongous! \nComes our last day where we went to\
  \ Meena bazar for more of cheap shopping! Guys if you\u2019re looking for things\
  \ to take back home soveniers for friends and family this is the place! I also visited\
  \ the Gold souk, the dates market on our way don\u2019t really remeber which days.\
  \ I never thought I would say this but Dubai you will have a piece of my heart.\
  \ A place where my girls and I got even more closer. I would also like to say that\
  \ I would visit Dubai again since there are so many places for me yet to see and\
  \ I think every time You visit Dubai has something new to offer. Oh yes one important\
  \ thing I wanted to add I am a pure vegetarian and no it was not at all difficult\
  \ for me to find veg food. Since it was 700 words only this is like a brief, would\
  \ love to make a ppt on my trips. Concluding with how much I LOVE to travel, explore\
  \ and share my experiences. I would be obliged to be a part of this scholarship.\n\
  Thank you  for reading it this far. \nRegards \nLekha Gadda"
