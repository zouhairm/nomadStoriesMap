Text: "Naran is a high point (altitude of 2,409 meters (7,904 ft)) in the Mountains\
  \ of Karakoram on the north side border of Pakistan (Gilgit\u2013Baltistan region)\
  \ and on the southwest side border of China (the region of Xinjiang). It\u2019s\
  \ one of the wonders that lies in the northern areas of Pakistan, a country full\
  \ of wonders to explore. Every person in and out from Pakistan wishes to visit northern\
  \ areas of Pakistan once in his/her lifetime. Same is in my case, which inspired\
  \ me to visit these areas. My journey started with my uncles, cousins and family\
  \ persons. People there use heavy 4x4 vehicles to visit these areas but due to limited\
  \ funding and financial sources we chose our motorcycles of daily use to cover a\
  \ long winding Karakoram highway on two wheels. Because love for travelling has\
  \ no limitations. We selected to start our journey at night because one can easily\
  \ cover more distance in a short interval due to less traffic. Everyone was excited.\
  \ We left our homes at 12:00 AM approximately after having a light amount of dinner.\
  \ We refueled our bikes and made the tank full. After a long ride drive, we covered\
  \ distance of 140 km out of 300 km Approximately. We stayed at a hotel near Abbottabad\
  \ to have some meal and take rest. After a stay of one hour approx., we continued\
  \ our journey towards the gateway of wonders. Everyone enjoying the ride and in\
  \ parallel sun is rising and mountains near us started to gleam. A combination of\
  \ shinning and dark mountains was making everyone delight. It\u2019s now 8:00 AM.\
  \ After a continuous ride, we reached Kaghan valley, a place reflecting natural\
  \ beauty and creation of Allah. Everyone was feeling ravenous and went to a local\
  \ hotel to have some breakfast. Everyone felt amazing and remarkable after having\
  \ a cup of tea with some bread and fried eggs, a breakfast of a true Pakistani.\
  \ After having a stay of an hour, we continued our journey and went to Shogran valley\
  \ (a top of Kaghan mountains). Here we are the only people on the bikes everyone\
  \ else was on a car or a 4x4 vehicle. But we managed to reach the top after a slow,\
  \ rough and continuous drive on bikes. After reaching the top, we took some selfies\
  \ and photos like every traveler do. Took a short nap and lunch. Stayed in the nature\
  \ for a while. Enjoyed light puffs of natural air. This made our souls fresh. We\
  \ took a short stay up there because we are on bikes and two-wheel vehicle took\
  \ large amount of time in travelling then a four-wheel vehicle and we have to go\
  \ further. We managed to cover the remaining hilly road and reached our destination.\
  \ We stayed there and laid on the grass near Saiful Muluk lake and enjoyed the fresh\
  \ water. The lake is at an altitude of 10,578 feet above sea level. The lake is\
  \ one of the highest lakes in Pakistan and located above the tree line. Tourists\
  \ from all over the world come to see the natural beauty of the lake and valley,\
  \ both, every year. It\u2019s now 2:00 PM. We left towards our home. After a continuous\
  \ driving, with very few stays then coming, we reached home at night at 10:00 PM.\
  \ The journey was successful without any accident, we managed to reach home. Since\
  \ I was five years old, I wished to move out of the limits and restrictions in which,\
  \ such as all children of my age are kept. I always wished to travel and explore\
  \ the areas within Pakistan and around the whole globe. I made my first journey\
  \ of my life and ready for more travelling in the future. Finally, I want to say\
  \ that I\u2019ve only two interests in my life, one is travelling and second is\
  \ tasting different foods, and I\u2019m ready to follow my dream of travelling in\
  \ the future."
