Text: "Peaceful morning, humming birds, dancing trees and happy faces. Mouth-watering\
  \ breakfast with strong tea. What a perfect combination for a perfect start of a\
  \ day. Rida and I were standing in the balcony holding a plate full of fresh, red\
  \ cherries enjoying the beauty of Hunza Valley. It was three days continuous drive\
  \ from my city Islamabad to Hunza, but the landscape along the roads were mesmerizing.\
  \ We arrived in the evening and fell asleep right after checking into the hotel\
  \ room. My morning started seeing the breath-taking views of Hunza Valley from my\
  \ balcony at fourth floor of the hotel at the top of Karimabad Town, Hunza. The\
  \ view was perfect. I can see local ladies cleaning their houses, little children\
  \ going to school and the young men and women both working together. Hunza is a\
  \ beautiful valley in Gilgit Baltistan region in Northern Pakistan with immense\
  \ snow-caped peaks, wonderful faces, and with 100% literacy rate. I guess they are\
  \ so lucky to be surrounded by such beauty. My plate of cherries was finished and\
  \ I couldn\u2019t realized that I have to get ready to visit the The Baltit Fort.\
  \ The weather was warm so we ended up wearing simple cotton shirts along with casual\
  \ sandals. The Baltit Fort\u2019s street were mostly like the streets in Santorini,\
  \ Greece. Beautiful, charm and magnificent right at the top of a mountain. It was\
  \ standing with all its grace between those mighty mountains. \nForgetting all my\
  \ stress, I was living my best days in Hunza and of course the Khunjerab Pass, the\
  \ highest crossing border between China-Pakistan. It was on my bucket list to visit\
  \ this place and for someday I\u2019ll cross this border. The Karakorum Highway,\
  \ I can say it\u2019s the eighth wonder of the world for sure due to its sharp and\
  \ dangerous structure. It stretch towards the Khunjerab Pass passing by the Hunza\
  \ Valley and Gilgit city. So, according to the plan Khunjerab was our next stop\
  \ after Hunza. The next day we depart early in the morning after having the \u2018\
  anda-paratha\u2019 a half cooked omelet yet so yummy and of course my morning pill,\
  \ Tea. Rida was resting on my shoulder while I was capturing the fascinating views\
  \ outside the car\u2019s window. The greenery was gradually decreasing as we were\
  \ going towards the height and cold. Finally we reached the entrance of Khunjerab\
  \ National Park after three hours of continuous drive from Hunza. I thought that\
  \ we\u2019re almost there but my bad, it was fifty-two kilometers away from that\
  \ entrance point. But never mind, travelling is a refreshing thing for me. I can\
  \ sit for days and nights without getting tired. So, I was just enjoying the beauty\
  \ and thanking God for this trip. Along the road there were such massive glaciers\
  \ and highest peaks among the world.  So, we finally reached the Pass. The places\
  \ was covered with snow looking like a white carpet and smooth road passing through\
  \ the Pass. We were at the border of Pak-China, divided by the boundary and a gate.\
  \ Snow, hailing, raining, and sunshine; all these I witnessed during two hours stay\
  \ there. It was fun playing with the snow-balls. Rida lay down on the snow as she\
  \ was laying on her bed but we couldn\u2019t stop her. How could we because it was\
  \ her dream to visit this place. Her lips turned blue but she didn\u2019t come out\
  \ of the snow. Ifrah and I were running around but my parents were sitting by the\
  \ side. Khujerab Pass is at 16,010 feet above the sea-level, so the air pressure\
  \ in high. Even the tea there is cooked in pressure cooker. Unfortunately, I couldn\u2019\
  t ask for the tea. It\u2019s amazing that how travelling could change weather, location\
  \ and even mood by moning from one place to another. One day in Hunza, enjoying\
  \ fresh-red cherries with just cotton shirt on, to the next day at Khunjerab with\
  \ icy-cold weather and long boots and jackets. Well I couldn\u2019t be more grateful,\
  \ so I just rest my head on the backseat and enjoyed the view."
