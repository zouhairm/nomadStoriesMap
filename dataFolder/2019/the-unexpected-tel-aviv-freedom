Text: "We all hear the same news and all believe the same thing: Israel is in constant\
  \ war with every Arabic countries surrounding it and therefore is living in fear\
  \ and just protects itself. Well, everything that we've been assuming based on the\
  \ media has honestly been quite biased and untrue. How would I know? I visited the\
  \ country with my own eyes and never felt happier. \n\nYes, the country is in a\
  \ war but this doesn't seem to stop its residents to enjoy their lives to their\
  \ fullest.  In fact, I find Israelis to be some of the most free spirited people\
  \ I've ever met, especially in Tel-Aviv.\n\nThe popular city is located close to\
  \ the Mediterranean and has a constant beautiful weather. The advanced tech city\
  \ welcomes everyone in its surroundings - from Jews to Muslims to Christians and\
  \ more - and hosts one of the biggest Gay Pride parade every year in June.\n\nI\
  \ wasn't really sure what to expect when I first went to visit it. Maybe religious\
  \ people all over the streets? Perhaps a city resembling to somewhere in the south\
  \ of France? Really, I had no clue that actually Tel-Aviv was a mix of Montreal\
  \ and Miami. I know, weird mix but between the downtown looks of the Israeli city\
  \ mixed with the sea, that's what first came to my mind.\n\nAnyhow, aside of the\
  \ looks of the city - what I found later astonished me even more than the looks\
  \ of the city.\n\nJust like any other 20 something year old, I went out with my\
  \ new-made friends in Tel-Aviv in the infamous club Shalvata for a few drinks and\
  \ a lot of dance. The moment we entered the club I couldn't believe what I saw -\
  \ everyone seemed to have the time of their lives. Unlike most clubs in other central\
  \ cities, Tel Aviv's Shalvata seemed like an ongoing Bar Mitsvah were girls and\
  \ guys were both dancing together in a party atmosphere and not just a grinding\
  \ environment. \n\nYou see, the North American night clubs often will look like\
  \ something like that: girls keeping to themselves while the guys will unsuccessfully\
  \ try to dance with them without really asking. Now, from what I got in Israel,\
  \ it's a little different. \n\nEveryone was dancing face to face like a respectable\
  \ party until some would agree to do some more heavy dancing. It was really fun\
  \ and the pressure to find one person to dance with was completely non-present.\n\
  \nI spent the whole night wondering why was this so different than any other country\
  \ I went to party at and came to the obvious conclusion that most of these young\
  \ adults are either soldiers or are coming out from the army and so they don't waste\
  \ time to have a good time. They want to party with their brothers, their sisters,\
  \ their friends, their lovers, strangers - everyone! They just want to have fun\
  \ and they include everyone in their party, which was honestly a culture shock for\
  \ me. \n\nI loved the idea of actually having fun at a club and partying and dancing\
  \ like no one was watching - because no one was! They let you being you and it was\
  \ a beautiful experience."
