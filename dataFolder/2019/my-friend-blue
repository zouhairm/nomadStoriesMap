Text: "3 Homosexual men: Horror bestselling novelist, holistic healer who swears like\
  \ a sailor and international crossover singer sensation Blue get moved together\
  \ by circumstances. \n\nEach hiding his own fears. Singer is buying time by revealing\
  \ his homosexuality because he's hiding being HIV positive. Seemingly from public\
  \ but later revealed from his mother who has cancer, was single parent, came from\
  \ nothing and don't want her to feel at end she failed. Cancer mindset vs HIV mindset.\n\
  \nA younger character will also be in the mix. He will represent the young part\
  \ about homosexuality, the reasons behind what can publicly appear like disapproving\
  \ behaviour.\n\nMy excitement about this book is that it will inspire people, flush\
  \ and refill their emotions. It will be a sensational book because if you could\
  \ never explain to your parents what homosexuality is, how you can embrace both\
  \ spirituality and religion, the fears of being gay, this book explains those. It\
  \ is even a plea on behalf of us hounding the celebrities, invading their lives,\
  \ a reflection of how intrusive we are.\n\nDance of the Rain, my launch book is\
  \ in its final stages of being ready to be published online with Amazon. Dance of\
  \ the Rain took me 19 years to write: About 10 times by hand when I was supposed\
  \ to do school work, twice on 2 different laptops I bought exclusively to work on\
  \ my manuscript on, one-and-a-half times on an old electronic typewriter I found\
  \ at a second-hand store. I was devastated when I could not find replacement ink\
  \ cartridge for the machine. On two different occasions I retyped this work into\
  \ my aunty Lorna's computer. She asks me about it all the time. She really deserves\
  \ having that book dedicated to her. In support of my application, I am happy to\
  \ supply you with a free copy.\n\nMy friend, Blue (the travel book) is set in Cape\
  \ Town but one of the lead characters is an international music success and he has\
  \  een everywhere so knowledge of many places will definitely be to my advantage.\
  \ Personally, I've already had the privilege of visiting South America, Abu Dhabi\
  \ & Dubai.\n\nThe bestseller writer is very well travelled too, so most of the experience\
  \ I gain from this trip, if you choose me, would be from the writer's point of view.\
  \ That is perfect! I can even build the younger character's existence around it.\
  \ I will acknowledge this trip in very favourable and if you like, promotional ways,\
  \ in My friend, Blue.\n\nEven though the current location of the book is Llundudno\
  \ Beach is Cape Town, South Africa, this is a matter very much open to consideration\
  \ and amendment. I am particularly thinking of something resembling the manmade\
  \ island Eden where so many South Africans life. I have not had the privilege of\
  \ visiting it yet and I'm one of those writers that NEED to experience the environment\
  \ in all its totality available to best describe it.\n\nPlease, take me? Since childhood,\
  \ I've dreamed of being and international bestseller travelling sensation and I\
  \ will visit locations for extended periods of time to really become one with the\
  \ environment you need to describe. Like Wilbur Smith! It's an incredible kind of\
  \ magic.\n\nThe first moment I fell in love with books is when I read To Kill A\
  \ Mockingbird. It was the most incredible literature my eyes had ever come across.\
  \ I was hungry for reading. I NEEDED more. I read profusely. It fascinated me. In\
  \ school I would get a kick out of creating book reports for colleagues and the\
  \ teachers fell for it. Every report was perfectly suited to personality. I'd even\
  \ sneak in appropriate spelling mistakes, grammatical and punctual errors. That\
  \ was long before the days you could Google everything - Life was incredible then!!!\
  \ I was alive!\n\nThe moment I knew I had no chance but to write was when I read\
  \ The Pillars of the Earth by Ken Follet. I had NEVER read such a marvel. It awoke\
  \ within me the greatest desire to write in such a magical way, that one no longer\
  \ reads the story, you view it!\n\nI got that feedback on Dance of the Rain, thank\
  \ you!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
