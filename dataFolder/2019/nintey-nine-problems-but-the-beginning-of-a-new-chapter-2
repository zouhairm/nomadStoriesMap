Text: "You know that part in the Disney animated classic Alice in Wonderland when\
  \ she is falling down the rabbit hole and you see all the wonky stuff happening\
  \ around her and then she gets to Wonderland and everything is crazy and weird and\
  \ cool\u2026yeah, me too. In a lot of ways Alice in Wonderland describes my trip.\
  \ In the Summer of 2014 my Spanish teacher offered his classes a chance to travel\
  \ to Europe for a month to travel to 9 different countries (and the includes the\
  \ Vatican). Awesome, right? Absolutely! I didn\u2019t see any possible problems,\
  \ after all the teacher was taking care of everything and my grandpa was kind enough\
  \ to give me the money I was missing to pay for the trip. Great! Everything started\
  \ to go down hill at the airport. That is where I realized the two of my best friends\
  \ had parents coming along and I didn\u2019t get to sit next to them on the plane.\
  \ Fine, I could deal. We arrive in the United Kingdom and as any American who has\
  \ never been \u2018across the pond\u2019 will do we were in awe about driving on\
  \ the left side of the road. Then we got to the hotel and my friends were told they\
  \ had to share a room with their parents and I was stuck with a roommate I didn\u2019\
  t know in a new, albeit awesome and scary place. So, I did what any introverted\
  \ teenager would do\u2026 I called my mom. I was homesick. Another problem to add\
  \ to my growing list. We talked while she was at the store (time differences, you\
  \ know) and I was charging my phone. Feeling better I went to bed, little did I\
  \ know the problems to await me in the morning. Truthfully the morning started out\
  \ fine. My phone was charged, and I went downstairs to meet everyone. Luckily one\
  \ of my friends didn\u2019t have his parents along so we hung out for a bit. I learned\
  \ that complimentary breakfast is slightly different in London, but that\u2019s\
  \ fine I could deal. Everything was going to look up. It was my first trip out of\
  \ the country how could it not. We took the Underground, so we could see the Westminster\
  \ Abbey\u2026 and it started to rain. I know what your thinking, what kind of traveler\
  \ doesn\u2019t bring their umbrella to London? The one who forgot hers on a box\
  \ in the garage as she was leaving for the airport. I could deal with this too,\
  \ right? I shared an umbrella with one of my friends. We then took selfies with\
  \ Big Ben in the background after we left the Westminster Abbey gift shop. By the\
  \ end of the day my phone was at 15% for the constant photo use, but I was happily\
  \ tired, so I plugged my phone in and went to bed. Only to see the next morning\
  \ that my phone didn\u2019t charge. Why? Because, for some reason, my outlet converter\
  \ broke. My outlet converter! I felt like crying. Truly. One problem after another,\
  \ in a place I really had no idea about. Luckily one of my friends was able to convince\
  \ her mom to allow me to borrow their outlet converter for a little bit so I could\
  \ charge my phone (though that became a very hard process later in the trip). It\
  \ was then I realized something. These problems alone happened in just a two-day\
  \ period of a month-long trip. The problems didn\u2019t go away. I was alone a lot.\
  \ I had to basically beg every night to borrow an outlet converter. Even at the\
  \ end of the trip a virus corrupted my computer, erasing all of the travel pictures.\
  \ All of these problems allowed me to learn, learn to be on my own, learn to be\
  \ somewhere new, and learn to adapt. My crazy Wonderland trip was the best experience\
  \ I have ever had, this leap into the unknown taught me to adapt in a way that I\
  \ could never have done at home. It opened the world up to me and left me wanting\
  \ more."
