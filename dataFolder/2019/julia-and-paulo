Text: "She played music on her phone as she walked absorbing the details of everything\
  \ close to her.\nShe was about to fall when two strong hands caught her. She found\
  \ herself looking into the face of handsome man that she had ever seen. He gazed\
  \ into her eyes and then said with an amazing accent 'Not sure who is happier me\
  \ with you or Isaac Newton with his apple?!'\nJulia felt light headed and flattered,\
  \ but despite that found herself yelling 'I beg your pardon.' Freeing herself from\
  \ his solid grip.\nAgain he said with that masculine beautiful accent of his 'Wrong\
  \ response, you should be thanking me for saving your life.' \nHe stood before her\
  \ while extending his hand 'Let me introduce myself, Paulo Olivier.'\nJulia laughed\
  \ and said 'And is that how you meet your victims? Pretending to have saved their\
  \ lives?'\n'Excuse me what are you saying? To be clear just like you, I was enjoying\
  \ a night out.'\nShe looked intensely at him, and just like Cinderella but without\
  \ leaving her shoes behind so her prince charming be able to find her she flee without\
  \ uttering a single word.\nShe heard him shouting back at her asking for her name\
  \ and telephone number, she wanted to go back and give him her phone number, but\
  \ told herself that she is here for a job interview to become rich not to fall in\
  \ love with strangers wandering around the city."
