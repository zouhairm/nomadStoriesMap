Text: "\u2018You have very soft hands. Do you do any chores at all?\u2019 Fatima asked\
  \ me as she skillfully squeezed the henna paste from the cone onto my hand, making\
  \ elegant shapes with it, every stroke well calculated, connecting each pattern\
  \ to the next.  \nI laughed. \u2018Of course I do\u2019 \n\u2018I don\u2019t think\
  \ so\u2019 she quipped. \nAt 27 she looked much older than her age. The creases\
  \ around her eyes more prominent every time she smiled. Her father, Mohamed worked\
  \ as a manager of the guest house where I was staying. She cooked, cleaned and did\
  \ the laundry. \n\u2018Do you cook for your husband?\u2019 she asked \n\u2018I don\u2019\
  t\u2019 \n\u2018You don\u2019t cook?\u2019\n\u2018I don\u2019t have a husband.\u2019\
  \nShe stopped and looked at me for a minute, raising her eyebrows. \u2018At your\
  \ age? Why?\u2019\n\u2018I haven\u2019t met the right guy yet\u2019\n\u2018Met the\
  \ right guy? Aren\u2019t your parents going to find someone for you?\u2019\nShe\
  \ had been lucky. Her father had adamantly refused to have her and her two sisters\
  \ circumcised as was the tradition in their home town and most parts of Somalia.\
  \ He could not have his relatives know this though, so he arranged to have an elderly\
  \ woman come to the house one day. The girls were taken to one room with her and\
  \ their mother and instructed to scream at intervals, one after the other. They\
  \ stayed in the room for a few days, hardly going out. A couple of days later, they\
  \ rejoined the rest of the family. The older women in the household congratulated\
  \ them for having become real women. \n\u2018How did you meet your husband?\u2019\
  \ I asked as she reached out for my second hand. \n\u2018My mother just told me\
  \ one day that they had found a suitor for me. I didn\u2019t meet him until three\
  \ months after we were married. I was here and he was in Nairobi on business. I\
  \ sat with my parents, uncle and aunt and an Imam performed the nikah. After the\
  \ ceremony was over I was told that I was now married\u2019 \nShe readjusted her\
  \ headscarf and pinned back wisps of hair which had come loose. \n\u2018You know\
  \ I had never really seen a man without a shirt on until Ahmed. The first day we\
  \ met I was sitting on the bed after dinner. He came into the bedroom and suddenly\
  \ started taking off his shirt. I screamed and ran out, to the living room. He followed\
  \ me and asked me what the matter was. I asked him why he was taking off his clothes\
  \ in front of me. He said it was okay because we were married. I didn't think it\
  \ was okay. Every night after that I would sit in the living room watching the TV\
  \ until I heard him snoring. Then I would creep into bed and sleep.\u2019 \nShe\
  \ giggled and looked up at me. I smiled slightly. \n\u2018All done. Just let it\
  \ dry for about thirty minutes then wash it off.\u2019 she announced a few minutes\
  \ later and held up my hands for me to see\n\u2018Thank you, I love it! How much\
  \ do I owe you?\u2019\n\u2018Oh come on! You are my sister. I can\u2019t charge\
  \ you for this\u2019 she said as she got up to leave. \n\u2018You need to get married\
  \ soon. Before it\u2019s too late. I can ask my father to find someone for you.\
  \ Somali men are good.\u2019 She said as she gingerly walked out of the room, leaving\
  \ the scent of her musky perfume wafting in the air."
