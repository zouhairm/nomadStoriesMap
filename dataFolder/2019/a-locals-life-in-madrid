Text: "The heat crept up and embraced us as soon as we got off the plane. I gripped\
  \ the hand of a lover, who was as a eager to embrace this country for a couple of\
  \ days and immerse himself in the culture as I was.\n\nMadrid had always took me\
  \ for a vast city, hazy memories of park day visits with basking heat and sweet\
  \ sunshine. My travel partner had ageed to return to the city with me, having the\
  \ strong desire to find local cuisine, bars and notorious spots.\n\nWe passed a\
  \ local fruit shop on the way to our hotel. Gripping my bag full of mixed fruits,\
  \ the first bite into my peach exploded feelings of hydrating, sweet nectarine.\
  \ It reminded me the familiarity of how fresh and renewed every new place I travelled\
  \ had rewarded me with.\n\nThe food and drink markets of Spain always fascinated\
  \ me, with Madrid being no exception. The buzzing crowd of the markets excited and\
  \ enthralled me. As a self confessed foodie and slight red wine addict, I was very\
  \ much a child in a sweet shop. From filled croquettes to satisfying sangria, my\
  \ senses felt alive with smells and sounds filling the air. It\u2019s a great time\
  \ to mix with locals, testing our broken Spanish with gratitude and love in eyes\
  \ of the community... \n\nThe bars however were my favourite part of the whole trip.\
  \ We were lucky enough to be around during the time of the World Cup. The atmosphere\
  \ in sports bar was incredible. We made friends with the main behind the bar named\
  \ Carlos. We used google translate to interact and ended up scoring plates of free\
  \ food and booze. It was yet another night I still dream of when thinking of Madrid\
  \ and all it has to offer. \n\nDay drinking, sun, glorious food and exploring are\
  \ certainly on the agenda for anyone lucky enough to pay this city a visit."
