Text: "\"This is Hollywood, what's yo' dream? Everybody who comes to Hollywood gots\
  \ the dream. What's yo' dream?\"\n \nI am in Long Beach California, looking for\
  \ an internship for college credit. Unbelievably, I get an interview with MGM Studios.\
  \ I can't believe it. I think all the other film students want to kill me (\"Good\
  \ Luck Jess!\" but I saw the venom), and I'm fantasising was too hard - YAY opportunity\
  \ of a lifetime, they are going to hire me, make me a movie star etc...it was only\
  \ about an hour into my pool-boy and cadillac fantasy that I realise I have no idea\
  \ what the job actually IS. .\n \nSo two trains, two buses, an earful of YO SUGAR\
  \ I'LL TAKE YO ASS DOWNTOWN and passing through Compton, I get to Hollywood. Have\
  \ to admit I feel really posh (as I slip out of my sandals and into my borrowed\
  \ heels...) with a VIP pass and everything. I go in, and the man is like a Vegas-hotel\
  \ owning caricature from a movie: pinstripe suit and one of those diamond rings\
  \ that could knock you out. He is interviewing while simultaneously watching the\
  \ football game on the huge TV behind me.\n \n\"So Jessica, why do you want to work\
  \ for MGM?\"\n\"Uh...\"\nI had been so busy stressing out how to get to Hollywood\
  \ from Long Beach on public transport that I had forgotten to prepare for the actual,\
  \ you know, JOB INTERVIEW. I just make a whole bunch of stuff up - I'm the manager\
  \ of my local cinema, I won the media prize for the state, made the top Short Film\
  \ in the country, you know, small white lies.\nHe keeps nodding, so I keep rambling,\
  \ and RAMBLING (I was actually nominated for an Emmy, etc...) until he stops me\
  \ and goes, \"Wow. You are SO NERVOUS right now. Girl, just chill.\" \nHOW NERVE-RACKING\
  \ IS THAT?!\nSo I kind of figure out during HIS rambling (this is the real world\
  \ baby, you gotta network, start at the bottom, insert cliche here, etc...) that\
  \ the internship is for the MGM channel, and I would need to screen films to make\
  \ sure they are appropriate and write the synopsis for them for the TV guide. \n\
  \ \"So Jessica,\" he continues,  \"Here, we screen films. I need to know how you\
  \ feel about content. I will be asking you, in this film, do we have TNA, do we\
  \ have violence, do we have-'\n\"I'm sorry..uh...what's TNA?\"\n\"Tits and ass,\
  \ hun. As I was saying, you will need to check for breasts, are they up close, are\
  \ we getting one, do we get two? Is there nipple? And if so, is it close up or just\
  \ a suck and squeeze? And with sex, are we talking just with eyes, rocking motion,\
  \ or (claps hands quickly to make that awful noise) full-bloodied pounding? I need\
  \ to know, are you comfortable with that?\"\n\"Uh...it's...9am...\"\n\"Great! Also,\
  \ this is a shared compound, which means we share the lot with Playboy Inc-\"\n\"\
  ...\"\n\"So every other day there will be women walking around, sometimes in nothing\
  \ but a thong, maybe some tan, and they might be shooting you know, full adult content\
  \ in there. When you're doing your screenings there might be 24 television sets\
  \ in the room, one for your movie for MGM, and the other 23 could be full-blown\
  \ porn. Hell, there could be a porno being filmed right now as we speak! I'm not\
  \ saying I approve, I'm saying that's what's here. Are you ok with that?\"\n\"I...\"\
  \n\"Great! Well, let me give you a tour...\"\n \nAfter wanting to cut my feet off\
  \ (I'm not a size 7, learn something new every day...) I get a tour and tea as we\
  \ watch some porn. After hearing of my travels, he doesn't want me to take three\
  \ hours to get home. And so this is how the head of MGM studios hops in his Rolls\
  \ Royce and gives me a lift back to Long Beach State. I also find out during our\
  \ hour long ride that he enjoys fishing and researching Asian architecture in his\
  \ spare time. \n\nWill I take it? No. But thanks for teaching me about TNA, Hollyweird."
