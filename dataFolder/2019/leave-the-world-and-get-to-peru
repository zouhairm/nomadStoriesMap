Text: "There are irrevocable and unavoidable decisions. My decision to travel to Perut\
  \ was at midnight, I had a broken heart and I wanted to leave this world, at least\
  \ the one I was living. Thus, however, no one or a place to travel to a country\
  \ was known. I did not have a route, the only one I wanted to follow was a life\
  \ that would take me away from the sadness and pain that I felt at that moment.\
  \ I did not know if I would dare but I did.\n\nI traveled alone for the first time\
  \ outside of my country. I fulfilled a ritual of a woman traveling alone: rent a\
  \ lodging in a shared place, fill a suitcase as light as possible, make friends\
  \ from other countries talking about the same trivialities as projects to change\
  \ the world, discover that broken hearts are understood speak different languages.\
  \ I arrived in Cusco with the sole purpose of knowing Machupicchu and returning\
  \ home, but everything was different. My trip had no other destination than to unveil\
  \ the mysteries of the Inca culture to escape the clouds that were inside me. Cusco\
  \ received me as a perfect stranger: silent, cold, surrounded by stone but with\
  \ an indescribable beauty.\n\nI let myself be carried away by the rhythm of a new\
  \ city ready to forget, heal and meet me again. I arrived at 6 am to my room with\
  \ shared bathroom rented by Airbnb, in a house of the ancestor century, where the\
  \ stairs creaked in each step, as my emotions about to collapse. The laughter of\
  \ Jackie, the owner of the house, made up for everything. There everything was happiness,\
  \ it was like arriving with an aunt that I loved in childhood and I did not see\
  \ in years. Fresh bread every day, guarana jelly, coca tea, steaming local coffee\
  \ and avocado (which they call palta) for breakfast. She pushed me literally to\
  \ leave her house to the new world and walk a new route: the Andes mountain range,\
  \ the Sacred Valley and all the paraphernalia that always falls short because contemplating\
  \ that landscape is the best cure for a bundled soul. There was more to know, beyond\
  \ Machupicchu.\nI bought daily tours to know the areas surrounding Cusco by a tourist\
  \ guide who was also familiar: as a lost uncle found in the South American cone:\
  \ The first destination was Ollantaytambo and its intimidating location, as well\
  \ as the conservation of the site with those walls bordered by roads that let you\
  \ look at an imaginary world where you can sit and contemplate the mountains and\
  \ the sky painting in front of you and in your mind all that can happen through\
  \ it in a game without time; then we went to Pisac where I made hundreds of mental\
  \ calculations to understand the perfection and iteration of its parallel lines\
  \ and where I learned that the cultivation of potatoes not only gave the old Incas\
  \ a fruit to eat but profound knowledge about the behavior of the earth and his\
  \ romance with the sun and the love triangle that forms when the rain appears. What\
  \ a festival. \nA brief visit to Chinchero with no time to lose in its terracotta\
  \ tones, its inhabitants attached to the naturalness of its history and the comfortable\
  \ mountain and resting at the back of the stage, as if demanding its dominion, its\
  \ command and much of the admiration of those out there pass. Salina de Maras was\
  \ a silent scream at the top of the mountain, traveling along the edge of the cliff\
  \ living between the beauty of the deep hill and the nightmare of an imaginary avalanche\
  \ and finally Moray with all its perfection, circles and circles in a symphony endless\
  \ that I had the opportunity to walk before a drizzle that later became a storm\
  \ forced us to return to the city. Each place was a meditation, a trip to the interior,\
  \ because now that I remember there I was in each place seeing myself, admiring\
  \ my perfection, seeing how despite the storms, the weather, the space, the invasions\
  \ and the abandonments it is possible to rebuild, found and preserve beauty."
