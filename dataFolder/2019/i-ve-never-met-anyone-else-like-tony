Text: "\"I've never met anyone else like Tony.\"\n\n\"Staying with Tony was a once\
  \ in a lifetime experience\"\n\n\"I will never forget my time with Tony.\"\n\nIn\
  \ 2015 I spent 11 months travelling throughout the United Kingdom, Israel/Palestine,\
  \ Eastern Europe and Eurasia. I had recently gone through something truly horrible\
  \ and heartbreaking at home and went to find myself, as if overnight during the\
  \ assault I had been dissected and spread out, piece of piece across the world,\
  \ like some kind of fucked up scavenger hunt. The length of my trip required being\
  \ extremely frugal and financially creative, as I continued trying to piece myself\
  \ back together, one shawarma at a time. In hopes of cutting down on hostel costs,\
  \ I found myself exploring the free networking service Couchsurfing. This is how\
  \ I met Tony.\n\nPrior to my first Couchsurfing experience, I learned techniques\
  \ surfers use to stay safe during trips, many of which focus on how to vet a host\
  \ for credibility and ensuring your values somewhat align. Tony's profile checked\
  \ all the boxes: multiple of photos of himself and his home, a lengthy and charismatic\
  \ biography, hundreds of friends, and copious reviews. I couldn't believe my luck;\
  \ staying with a local Turkish artist in a hot-pink mansion atop a hill in Istanbul?\
  \ What a unique and authentic way to get acquainted with Turkey and some of its\
  \ residents. After all, travelling is about the people you meet. Tony and I chatted\
  \ on Couchsurfing for while and agreed he would be happy to host us in exchange\
  \ for some help around his house and garden. He provided his address and we agreed\
  \ on an arrival date.\nThe first surprise we experience during our time with Tony\
  \ was that he did not live in Istanbul but moreso in a small, sleepy suburb that\
  \ felt more like a village than a community near an infamous cosmopolitan city.\
  \ It took about 3.5 hours on various streetcars, buses, boats and walking streets\
  \ with no names to reach his house from Taksim Square. Luckily, the description\
  \ of his house was accurate; the hot pink mansion peeking through the thrush and\
  \ looming over the village was difficult to miss. After the guard dogs ceased their\
  \ barking and the first two security gates buzzed us through, we were invited into\
  \ the house in broken English from an older woman that turned out to be Tony's elderly\
  \ stepmother. We watched Tony arrive slightly after us through the window. It took\
  \ a whole 2 minutes for us to realize we had trapped ourselves with a misogynistic,\
  \ temperamental, eccentric and entitled man who had a penchant for weapons, slut-shaming\
  \ and medicating his self-diagnosed bipolar disorder with home-grown marijuana while\
  \ sharing stories that seemed unbelievable, yet endlessly seemed to be proved by\
  \ photographs, lawsuits and fear from the neighbours and other memorabilia collected\
  \ over Tony's 40 years spent living in Mongolia, Brooklyn, LA as a young adult and\
  \ Turkey. \nBackpackers often think of Turkey as a living artefact of the Ottoman\
  \ Empire; a place of history, Islamic art, with delicious delicacies tucked away\
  \ on side-streets explored by the likes of Anthony Bourdain, and largely as a place\
  \ with an obvious and rigid sense of what constitutes moral behaviour. Tony defied\
  \ these social norms and expectations with ease. This story will detail what happened\
  \ during my week with Tony, and just how right the Courchsurfing reviews I read\
  \ were, just not in the way I expected."
