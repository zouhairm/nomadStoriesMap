Text: "I\u2019m sticky and sweaty. You can tell I\u2019m not from here, not only by\
  \ my fair complexion and the perpetual, slightly confused expression on my face,\
  \ but also by the fact that I\u2019m not used to the heat. The rickshaw driver drops\
  \ me off in the middle of nowhere. A bus picks me up next and we make our way outside\
  \ Mumbai, where I am to visit a tribal school. The tribal school is a house made\
  \ of clay with one room and 20 students. They\u2019re so scared and nervous, as\
  \ am I. They\u2019re very cautious around me, they\u2019re like tiny, fragile sparrows,\
  \ when I know very well, that life will make Bengal tigers out of them. Such is\
  \ the Indian grit and perseverance. \nWe warm up to one another and use body language\
  \ to say what we mean. I mean well-please believe me. \nFootball is used as a bonding\
  \ tool. So is jumping rope. Amazing how little it takes to make children roar with\
  \ laughter- I live vicariously through them. It\u2019s been a long time since I\
  \ last felt happy. Everyone calls me didi, but that\u2019s all right- my name has\
  \ too many vowels, I\u2019ll take Didi. \nCows are mooing, the earth is scorched\
  \ by the heat, I feel nostalgic and miss my grandparents. But a young Indian girl\
  \ yanks me out of the moment and demands my attention. Takes my hand and leads me\
  \ on the field. We thrown a ball and count in different dialects blended together,\
  \ almost as if making up a secret language that only we understand. We both want\
  \ this moment to last forever- me because I never want to return to society and\
  \ a life that conditions me, confines me, defines me, robs me of moments like these.\
  \ Her because she loves me.\nI braid her greasy hair and want to give her a hug,\
  \ but I\u2019m scared that if I\u2019ll pull her into a hig, she\u2019ll disintegrate\
  \ and this memory will slip between my fingers like sand on beaches that I\u2019\
  ve never even walked on. It\u2019s soon time for me to leave and she knows it. I\
  \ can feel the tension in her heart - she wants me to know she\u2019s courageous,\
  \ she\u2019s not going to cry. My lionhearted girl. She walks me to the gate, hugs\
  \ me, kisses the sweaty back of my neck and doesn\u2019t wipe her mouth. If that\
  \ ain\u2019t love then I don\u2019t know what love is. \nAs I walk towards the bus\
  \ station, I hear her shrieking, her fists around the grates of the gate, \u201C\
  Didi! Didi\u201D, she yells. I turn around to look her in the eyes, I\u2019m crying,\
  \ but she\u2019s not.\nOn the bus I sit next to a woman who smells like jasmine.\
  \ Didi means \u201Colder sister\u201D in Hindi."
