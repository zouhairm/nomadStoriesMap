Text: "I hadn\u2019t felt her since that day. The day she woke with the crows, and\
  \ flew away in the murder. \n\nIt was a cold dreary morning, the kind of cold that\
  \ seeps into bones, dead or alive. \n\nHer legacy flowing from the pool of tears\
  \ my grandfather let fall, as he said goodbye to her. A goodbye in tongues, my seven-year-old\
  \ brain didn\u2019t quite understand. \n\nHe grew up in Nazi Germany as a Jewish\
  \ boy. She grew up in Paris, France under the watchful eye of a seamstress and the\
  \ Cath\xE9drale Notre-Dame de Paris. \n\nTo this day, I still don\u2019t know what\
  \ he said to her\u2212burned with her ashes. \n\nAt that age, I didn\u2019t really\
  \ understand death. I still don\u2019t. \n\nBut if my life were captured within\
  \ the confines of a classic novel, then I just exchanged my innocence for the reality\
  \ that I would no longer hear her sing Fr\xE8re Jacques, I would never again run\
  \ away to her arms and, one day, I would forget the sound of her voice and the smell\
  \ of her embrace. Her touch lost to me. \n\nI hadn\u2019t felt her since that day.\n\
  \nUntil last summer, the summer I packed my Osprey 46L Porter, bought a single one-way\
  \ ticket to Dublin and explored Europe for the first time. \n\nFrom herding cows\
  \ in Mullinavat, Ireland; finding book exchanges in Friedberg, Germany; sailing\
  \ along the Danube in Budapest, Hungary, cliff-jumping in Zadar, Croatia \u2013\
  \ to eating my way through Brussels, Belgium; couch-surfing in Porto, Portugal;\
  \ kayaking in Catalonia, Spain. But, my trek through Europe\u2019s vastly diverse\
  \ cultures and subway systems, didn\u2019t end with the paella in Barcelona.  \n\
  \nIt ended in France. \n\nThe place it began for her, the birthplace of my first\
  \ best friend. \n\nI didn\u2019t realize my travels were leading me here, to her,\
  \ but the subconscious has a funny way of guiding, like blindly following trail\
  \ markers along El Camino de Santiago.  \n\nI took an 11-hour Flix bus route from\
  \ Barcelona, Spain to Aix-en-Provence, France. \n\nWith only one full day to explore\
  \ the beige city, I wandered. I wandered until I stumbled upon Au P\u2019etit Quart\
  \ d\u2019Heure. A little wine bar etched into the city\u2019s aged foundation. A\
  \ welcoming presence as the doors opened wide and spilled seating out into the warm\
  \ June air.\n\nOver the sounds of drinks flowing, passing conversations and heels\
  \ meeting the worn cobble, I heard her.\n\nI heard her in the accent of the bartender\
  \ who offered a free glass of red wine and meat p\xE2t\xE9 to a quiet party of one\
  \ in the corner. His name was Samuel, and his kindness felt like hers\u2212consuming\
  \ me. \n\nAnd later, I stepped off another bus. This time in the heart of Lille,\
  \ a northern city hugging the French and Belgium border. \n\nIn Lille, I saw her\
  \ through the eyes of my great-uncle Michele, her brother. He welcomed me into his\
  \ home, just like she did, when I was running from the monsters of my childhood.\
  \ He stumbled through English, and I tripped over my high school French. But, we\
  \ shared laughter over mussels, cheese and wine, as the sunset over the hedges of\
  \ his quaint home nestled in the countryside. \n\nWe didn\u2019t talk much about\
  \ her, until he gave me all I needed. Something I didn\u2019t even realize I needed.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou look like her.\u201D\n\n\u201CWho?\u201D\n\n\u201CFran\xE7oise.\u201D\
  \n\nHer name. \n\nLike a wooden bridge carved into a hiking trail, he gave me a\
  \ moment alone with her, a flowing waterfall of his memories from their childhood\
  \ cascading through my journey into adulthood. \n\nBack on the bus to Paris, the\
  \ last stop. \n\nShe grew up running along the Seine.\n\nI now walked along its\
  \ banks, in a cloudless, sky dress, wondering if she once wore a dress like mine.\
  \ \n\nShe fell in love with my grandfather under those lampposts that belong in\
  \ the backdrop of the early-nineteenth century. \n\nStanding under one, as I waited\
  \ for a friend, I felt her pass through me as if she too had been here before, waiting\
  \ for him, my grandfather. \n\nWhen she began her journey to America to start my\
  \ family, she watched the Eiffel Tower fade in the distance. \n\nI walked towards\
  \ it."
