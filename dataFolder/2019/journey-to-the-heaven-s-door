Text: "The adventure started at the \"Yin & Yang\" country. Where the good is always\
  \ alongside with the bad and vice versa. In this full of philosophy country i taken\
  \ the leap to the Tianmen Mountain, First impression, well, i cannot even see the\
  \ top of this mountain it is a way too high, it shock me a bit that we took a minibus\
  \ to get to top, well, 10 minutes after waiting, not enough time to wonder about\
  \ it, it is show time ! we are taken to the roller coaster ride up to the top !\
  \ Guess what ?! it took 99 hair pin turns to get to the top. Lucky, i went up with\
  \ an empty stomach. It feels fun at first 30 turns then feel dizzy afterward but\
  \ along the way the higher it gets there are more to see and it gets more beauty.\
  \ \n\nFinally, i had arrived, almost near the top. hiked a little bit more to get\
  \ the view. i start to saw half of his beauty then i faster my feet to the tip of\
  \ the edge to saw it clearly. UNBELIEVABLE view ! for the very first time i am above\
  \ the clouds ! 4700 feet high, no wonder i cannot see it from under. i feel my heart\
  \ beating fast and from my lungs i want to scream out a freedom. \nThat is not the\
  \ end yet and it takes me more to the beauty highlight of this journey which is\
  \ the heaven's door itself. The journey need to go a little bit higher and saw it\
  \ from below i am in awe already. A huge cave, hole in the middle between two peaks\
  \ with 30 meters high. Looks like almighty door way with the view above those cave\
  \ is the sky it looks better because after small rain it makes fog come out from\
  \ those door. However, again, nothing is worth comes that easy fellas. Below those\
  \ gate there steep stairs with the total of 999 steps to finally reach heaven's\
  \ door. There is an instant way to get to the top, well, life sometime have an offer\
  \ for a shortcut to reach the top to reach this heaven's door is not an exception.\
  \ They also make a hole out the cliff and make an elevator not far from the stairs.\
  \ That is a good temptation, Well, i am a fan of number 9 since i was in high school,\
  \ proudly using that number as a my back number in my basketball jersey. So, i chose\
  \ to take the stairs with a belief that it brings more satisfaction to the victory\
  \ to reach the Heaven's door. In my heart i said maybe that is right it took more\
  \ determination and hard work to reach my victory but it is always gonna be worth\
  \ it.\nThis journey become a memorable and unforgettable for me that i didn't expected\
  \ not only the beauty but it also carries a lot of life lesson behind this journey."
