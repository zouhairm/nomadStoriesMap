Text: "Another hot and sticky day, much like everyday here. My friends and I are waiting\
  \ for a taxi on a bustling corner, to head outside of Havana for a skateboard contest.\
  \ We pile into the next available car, a bright purple 1950\u2019s Pontiac for which\
  \ I\u2019ve called shotgun, fair and square. The driver questions our destination\
  \ though, saying that there is nothing there except for a dilapidated complex. Indeed\
  \ it was, an old military schooling and sport facility thats been long abandoned\
  \ and falling apart. We explained to him that in the last few years, local skateboarders\
  \ have been building their own ramps and obstacles there to be away from the eye\
  \ of the public and police. Its much safer too, and kids of all ages go there to\
  \ skateboard or paint murals. He was happy to hear about this as his son recently\
  \ tried skateboarding and fell in love with it- but is still missing many parts\
  \ to make his own board. \n\nWe continue driving along the Malec\xF3n, a wide street\
  \ and seawall that serpents around 10km of Havana's northern coastline. It was built\
  \ over 100 years ago to protect the city from the ocean swell, where waves still\
  \ batter against the wall over 50ft high at times. Right now though, the waves are\
  \ crashing just over the wall, misting us with refreshing seawater as we drive by\
  \ with the windows down.\n\nWhile passing an intersection with a main avenue the\
  \ driver starts telling us a story. His friend and fellow cabbie recounts that a\
  \ few years ago he was driving on this same avenue, and the car in front of him\
  \ had a skateboarder holding onto the undercarriage and riding alongside. They were\
  \ going really fast he said, when suddenly the kid hit a pothole, fell off and was\
  \ almost ran over. Happening just in front of his face, the driver slammed the brakes\
  \ and skid around the still tumbling skater. \n\nI start grinning because I know\
  \ this story, because I\u2019ve lived it. That story was about me, while I was here\
  \ on a trip two years ago. I remember vividly the moment when I hit that pothole,\
  \ how the hot asphalt scraped skin off of my legs and arms and how long it took\
  \ to heal. I even remember that car which barely avoided me, a beige Lada sedan,\
  \ that was in fact the same car of his friend! He said that story has been widely\
  \ told over time, always wondering how everything panned out. What a small world,\
  \ we thought, and all started laughing in disbelief for the remainder of our ride.\
  \ Arriving at the weathered entrance of the complex we took a photo together. We\
  \ also remembered what parts his son was missing and rummaged through our bags-\
  \ found them all, brand new, and gifted it to him. We shared the kindest farewells,\
  \ and took down an email to send him our photo upon returning stateside. Months\
  \ went by without reply and we ended up forgetting about it, until almost a year\
  \ later we received an email. \u201CMuchisimas gracias\u201D it said, and attached\
  \ was a grainy photograph of his son skateboarding and using the parts we had given\
  \ him, still in love with skateboarding to this day."
