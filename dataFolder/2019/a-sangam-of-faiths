Text: "\u2018Are you sure of going alone ?\u2019 I know why my mother was worried.\n\
  \nI\u2019d decided to attend Kumbh Mela, the largest human congregation in the world.\
  \ This year 200 million pilgrims visited Triveni Sangam, a confluence of the rivers\
  \ Ganges, Yamuna and the mythical river Sarasvati, to bathe, with a hope to wash\
  \ away their sins and attain salvation. Nonetheless, it was uncommon to find a female\
  \ travelling alone to Kumbh.\n\n\u2018But you're not even religious\u2019. True.\
  \ Her words always had the power to make me rethink my beliefs, also question why\
  \ we had different faiths. I had to do this for myself.\n\nIt was supposed to be\
  \ a cold winter morning, but the sun was fiercely unkind, and shined bright over\
  \ our heads. I took off my fleece to wrap it around my waist. The path I\u2019d\
  \ to tread was far from easy as the roads were extremely filthy and damp from last\
  \ night\u2019s rains. I could hear religious chants all around me. Those hymns gave\
  \ strength to the pilgrims, as they had to walk in a procession for another couple\
  \ of hours to reach Sangam. \n\n\u2018Was it a foolish decision to be a part of\
  \ this?\u2019 I was definitely thrown out of my comforts, and was desperately looking\
  \ for a silver lining. My legs were failing me, and I was mentally exhausted to\
  \ be in the crowd for hours. As I walked closer to Sangam, I could hear the cries\
  \ of children and adults, asking for help over the loudspeaker. They were lost.\
  \ This year\u2019s Kumbh was the biggest of all and it was spread over a massive\
  \ 3200 hectares! Despite having high security all around me, I felt so anxious and\
  \ insecure. I clasped onto my bag tightly.\n\nAs I approached the riverfront, it\
  \ was even more unsettling to be around people in dripping wet clothes. I was completely\
  \ on the fence and I stood there for a minute. The river itself was invisible to\
  \ me, just a massive crowd of pilgrims taking a holy dip. But I could smell the\
  \ water as a gust of wind blew across my face.\n\nMy dilemma was finally put to\
  \ ease as a huge flock of birds soared above the water. It was unbelievably comforting\
  \ to me. There were hundreds of them and it was marvellous to see how they were\
  \ gliding as free as they could! As I stood there with my mouth wide open, unable\
  \ to contain my excitement, I saw a CISF officer walking towards me with a smile.\n\
  \n\u2018Incredible, right? These are Siberian birds, madam,\u2019 said Tarsem Singh,\
  \ a tall, middle-aged man with a long beard.\n\n\u2018They've come to bathe here\
  \ like the pilgrims\u2019. I smiled.\n\nThough there were 9000 CISF guards like\
  \ him, deployed to manage the crowd, his work wasn\u2019t any less challenging,\
  \ he explained. He had to stand near the barricades for almost 12 hours with hardly\
  \ any rest. However, the most difficult part of this job for him was staying away\
  \ from his family, who were in Punjab. \n\nAs he spoke of his daughter and his dreams\
  \ of her future, I could see his eyes gleaming with excitement. \u2018You must go\
  \ on a boat before leaving Kumbh.\u2019 He affirmed as I walked closer to the banks.\
  \ But he couldn\u2019t leave without getting me some sugarcane juice and fried pakoras.\
  \ I believe he was reminded of his daughter. In those moments we spent together,\
  \ I felt a fatherly love I have been missing all these years.\n\nTarsem waved at\
  \ me as the boat oared away. This small boat had pilgrims who were excited about\
  \ bathing in the river. On the contrary, I was there to witness the disparate sight\
  \ of the serene flight of birds and the chaos of pilgrims on my either side.\n\u2018\
  People long for this opportunity, you know?\u2019. A lady was perturbed to see that\
  \ I did not bathe when everyone else in the boat did. I was content even without\
  \ immersing myself in Sangam.\n\nThis trip was filled with uncertainties, however,\
  \ it reaffirmed my belief in kindness, love and humanity. Tarsem\u2019s words echoed\
  \ in my mind, \u2018You\u2019ve got to be good at heart, even before bathing in\
  \ Sangam\u2019."
