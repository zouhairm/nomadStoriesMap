Text: "I cut nervously through the emerald waves in the very old, very small kayak\
  \ lent to me by my Air B&B host:  a perk of staying in the 1970s style camper at\
  \ Campeggio Calo Cavallo on the Costa Smeralda, Sardinia.  I continued through the\
  \ choppy water, eager to pass the rocky outposts and explore as much of the coast\
  \ as I could in my tiny vessel.  To the North of me was Isola Tavolara; an impressive\
  \ slab of limestone stretching across this portion of the Tyrrhenian Sea.  Behind\
  \ me, the small stretch of beach dedicated to the Camp had begun to disappear. \n\
  \nIn my zeal, I had foregone the very practical use of a life jacket.  As the beach\
  \ grew smaller behind me, it became evident that in the increasingly wild and deep\
  \ waters , I could very well tip over, my too wide hips trapping me under the sea.\
  \  I considered those I would leave behind, as well as the weeks of adventure ahead\
  \ of my.  I turned myself around and headed to shore.\n\nThis was the first real\
  \ adventure I had embarked on since I had met my Air B&B host Massimo on the side\
  \ of the road 2 days prior.  Following a 13 hour journey from Toronto via London,\
  \ I wandered the scorching Olbia Costa Smeralda Airport parking lot, finally locating\
  \ the local bus that wound through the roads that passed near the camp.  On the\
  \ bus, I nervously followed my journey via the map on my phone, anxious that I exit\
  \ at the appropriate stop.  Soon I was at the outpost where I greeted Massimo, who\
  \ welcomed me with a warm hug before launching my suitcase into the back of his\
  \ car. \n \nPrior to our arrival at the campsite, Massimo treated me to a panoramic\
  \ view of the surrounding area.  From the vantage point of Belvedere a Capo Coda\
  \ Cavallo, I admired the expanse of Tavolara in the distance.  At its most Western\
  \ tip, secluded beaches were evident. To the East was Monte Cannone, it\u2019s highest\
  \ point.  Beyond the island in the distance was the small port city of Olbia.  The\
  \ sea directly below was dotted with sailboats both grand and simple in between\
  \ the island and the nearest beach. Among the tanned Italians that roamed the lookout,\
  \ I noted my pasty early summer complexion and visualized it\u2019s transformation\
  \ over the coming weeks.\n \nBright purple oleander canopied the gravelly roads\
  \ of the campsite that led to my personal site.  Nestled behind a hedge of native\
  \ flowers and plants was a spacious and private terrace complete with a simple kitchen,\
  \ dining table and lounge area. The vintage camper held a double bed to one side\
  \ and a dining table cum single bed to the other.  To the right of the camper was\
  \ that of my host.  Each morning I awoke to the sound of he and his wife chatting\
  \ in smooth Italian.   \n \nIn the days that followed, I alternated between hinging\
  \ my person to the ropey partition that separated the swimming area from the wilds\
  \ of the sea, and climbing the surrounding craggily rock faces.  In the early morning\
  \ I strolled the surrounding paths that snaked through the neighbouring brush before\
  \ swimming as far as I could in the salty water to safely gaze at Tavolara.  Following\
  \ a nap, I would tear up the soles of my feet seeing how close I could get to the\
  \ warm pools that hugged the rugged shore.  In the evening, I strained to hear the\
  \ entertainment located at the camp bar where Italian campers, young and old, sang\
  \ and danced as a DJ played Italian hits of yesteryear.  \n\nAfter Campeggio Calla\
  \ Cavallo, I found myself in Olbia; itself a welcoming small city with vibrant streets\
  \ and friendly locals.  From my hotel I craned as far as I could out of the hotel\
  \ window, taking in the local sounds and Tavolara well beyond the harbour.  My eyes\
  \ were never wide enough to absorb the light, the shades of blue, the flowers, the\
  \ people. Tavolara, with each passing hour revealed itself differently: the sunlight\
  \ sinking into its craters uniquely under the shifting sun."
