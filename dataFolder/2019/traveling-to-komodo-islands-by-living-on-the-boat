Text: "Born in a big city like Jakarta, has shaped me into who I am today. Living\
  \ well, went to a decent school and university got a decent job. I even don\u2019\
  t have to cross to another island by the boat or to hike another hill only for a\
  \ living. I am not trying to underestimate people who are doing that way, I even\
  \ really appreciate what they do.\n\nAt least, that\u2019s what I thought when me\
  \ and my husband travelled to Labuan Bajo, Flores. We really appreciate people who\
  \ are starting to make money in there, that is why no wonder if the price in Labuan\
  \ Bajo and surrounding island, not much different compared to Jakarta. In some things,\
  \ the price even higher. As we know, it might not easy for them to get some of the\
  \ food products in their area, because lack of accessibility and availability to\
  \ get all of the food products.\n\nThe first night we stayed in the small boat,\
  \ with limited electricity, no AC or fan, no wifi, even worse no phone signal, makes\
  \ me realize two things. First, how hard my life as if I have to do it for 7 days\
  \ without those things. And the last, the positive sides, me and my husband tried\
  \ to live with those limitations with our own way, we talked and laughed more, we\
  \ shared stories.\n\nI was very happy that I finally visited the Pink beach. The\
  \ pink beach was already on me and my husband's bucket list. And I can\u2019t believe,\
  \ after 2 years made the bucket list together, we finally made it there! I was speechless\
  \ and happy at the same time, I feel like I don\u2019t want to leave the beach.\
  \ After snorkelling for 15 minutes, then I just sat on the beach, felt the pink\
  \ sands and the sea water on my skin. That was very PINKISH! The wave was a bit\
  \ strong at that time, which made me and my husband were carried by the waves a\
  \ few times.\n\nAfter we also went to Rinca island. This island looked wilder than\
  \ in Komodo island itself, they also have a seashore. We can also easily found reindeer,\
  \ monkey, wild boar, and beautiful birds on this island. Actually, our tour guide\
  \ already mentioned that we can\u2019t expect to see Komodo dragons a lot in here,\
  \ because many of foreigners complained that quite rare they could see Komodo dragons\
  \ on this island.\n\nBecause last time it was already a bit late in the afternoon,\
  \ like around 3 or 4 pm, we decided to take the short trek one. After 5 minutes\
  \ walk, we found at least 3-4 Komodo dragons which were in the middle of the forest.\
  \ Foreign tourists were gathered with their groups and exchange to take pictures\
  \ with the Komodo.\n\nSo we did too!\n\nThe sun slowly sets, after accompanying\
  \ my husband to buy some Komodo souvenirs, then we back to the boat to enjoy our\
  \ last night in our Garuda boat. We were so lucky that we had a brand new boat with\
  \ 2 nice crew boat and a very good captain! When we parked our boat on the other\
  \ side of Komodo island in which a place where the house of villagers lived in,\
  \ all of sudden came two little kiddos who paddled their \u2018boat\u2019 which\
  \ was only made of thick styrofoam, came close to our boat.\n\nYes, they came to\
  \ our boat to sell their souvenirs. They brought small Komodo dragons, pin and magnetic\
  \ refrigerator. I was very amazed yet feel pity for them at the same time. After\
  \ school, they have had to help their parents making money for their lives. With\
  \ very limited English that they have, they tried to persuade my husband to buy\
  \ their souvenirs.\n\nWhen I looked at them, I suddenly had mixed feelings. I still\
  \ feel so lucky, blessed, grateful with my life but at the same time, amazed by\
  \ them. They really inspired me to live my life even we have to face many difficulties,\
  \ obstacles and challenges. I really wish they will always be healthy, growing as\
  \ smart kids and enjoy their childhood while they can."
