Text: "It was my first time in a black market. I scanned the street expecting threatening\
  \ vendors, crowded stalls in darks corners and contraband hidden conspicuously behind\
  \ sheets. Instead families gathered around tables of fruit, sodas and books, holding\
  \ bags of goods in the open and laughed as they greeted each merchandiser like an\
  \ old friend. \n\nI followed Roberto as he walked with purpose around the street\
  \ corner and into a narrow alleyway, which was draped wall to wall with fresh clothing,\
  \ shoes and other consumer goods. Brands such as Nike and Adidas laid amongst the\
  \ stalls of stationary and vegetables. These items became even more apparent juxtaposed\
  \ to portraits of Fidel Castro and the Cuban flag. Roberto caught my gaze. \u201C\
  A country of contradictions amiga,\u201D he laughed.\n\nWe continued through downtown\
  \ Havana, along the cobblestone streets and into different baroque style buildings,\
  \ reminiscent of the previous European influence. The outline of Spanish, French\
  \ and Italian styles were overshadowed by the vibrant Cuban colours that had unfortunately\
  \ faded with age. Each corner brought new stores and a barrage of new faces all\
  \ eager to sell their illegal goods. \u201CViagra Viagra,\u201D one man yelled,\
  \ \u201Cseis horas arriba amiga!\u201D I laughed and continued across the path in\
  \ search for our desired product.\n\n\u201CRemember what we need,\u201D Roberto\
  \ said as he searched ahead of me. I nodded.\n\nRoberto was the owner of my hostel\
  \ in Havana. Or more accurately, I was one of the traveling guests in his own home\
  \ as hostels are not present in socialist Cuba. In my eyes, he was the embodiment\
  \ of his country. There would be nights at the dinner table that Roberto would engross\
  \ his guests in socialist discussions, pro-government ideology and anti-American\
  \ mantra, all the while ironically running his own private capitalist enterprise,\
  \ the guest house, or \u201CCasa Particular\u201D. It was a side hustle, Roberto\
  \ liked to say, if I was to ever point out the irony. \n\nMost Cubans do have side\
  \ hustles however, whether it a Casa Particular, selling goods on the black market\
  \ or driving guests in \u201Ccollectivos\u201D to different cities. According to\
  \ the locals, it is necessary due to the government\u2019s wage and ration system\
  \ which was put in place after the revolution. \n\nWe continued winding between\
  \ stalls of milk, fresh water and magazines, below the beaming sun, until eventually\
  \ an hour had passed and still we had no luck.\n\n\u201CNo sorry amigo, everyone\
  \ is looking for it today. Good luck,\u201D a vendor said to Roberto, and turned\
  \ back to help another woman searching for bananas.\n\n\u201CAmiga\u201D, he turned\
  \ to me, \u201CEnjoy the city and I will continue.\u201D He wiped sweat from his\
  \ forehead and looked toward the expansive array of vendors he was yet to confront.\n\
  \n\u201CBuena suerte amigo,\u201D I replied.\n\nI awoke in the next morning in Roberto\u2019\
  s Casa Particular with the several other travelers housed in my room. A faint smell\
  \ of fried eggs wafted from the kitchen. He found the eggs."
