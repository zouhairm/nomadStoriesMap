Text: "It was 4 in the morning, December 21st 2015. I was laying there on the 2 inch\
  \ pad against the wall on the second floor of the shaking house, wondering how I\
  \ had made it into this situation. A long haired, unshowered ambitious 21 year old\
  \ with nothing but a giant red backpack that never lost its smell of fish and a\
  \ journal. Allie and I were on an adventure. \n\nThree weeks before we had sat down\
  \ at a Thai restaurant in Auckland New Zealand. Tempted by the five dollar meals,\
  \ this turned out to be the best Thai food that I had ever eaten! The green curry\
  \ was perfectly simmered from freshly chopped vegetables and served in a bowl so\
  \ big it proved to be an impossible feat to finish. In fact the food was so good\
  \ that I felt the need to compliment the chef on his delicious cooking! I confidently\
  \ marched into the kitchen singing praises for the delicious experience I just had.\
  \ The chef was pleased with my compliments and smiled in return. From the corner\
  \ of my eye, I noticed there was a sign saying the restaurant would be closed December\
  \ 18th through the holidays. Curious, I inquired further into the family\u2019s\
  \ plans for the break! \n\n\u201CAre you going anywhere for the holidays?\u201D\
  \ I asked. \n\n\u201CTo Thailand, home.\u201D He responded.\n\n\u201CSo fun! I want\
  \ to go!\u201D I quickly retorted without putting much effort into hiding my excitement.\n\
  \nThrough broken conversation, Allie and I got an invitation to stay with him at\
  \ his home in Thailand! Lost, adventurous and eagerly spontaneous, we agreed!\n\n\
  Fast forward through our epic hikes in the Fiordland mountains and moped rides along\
  \ the coast in Phuket, Allie and I share a twin size cot on the train headed east.\
  \ Fueled by the excitement of seeing Thailand past the touristy elephant rides and\
  \ cooking classes, we travel to Surin as the only people on the train who do not\
  \ look or speak Thai. When we arrive, Pui and Boontham are there waiting with a\
  \ pork sandwich for each one of us. A sigh of relief escapes me as I see their smiling\
  \ faces.\n\n\u201CHello hello! Welcome to Surin. We need pick up wedding photo for\
  \ tomorrow and we go home\u201D Boontham excitedly exclaims.\n\n\u201CGreat! Happy\
  \ to see you.\u201D I retort absentmindedly. \u201CWait, whose wedding is it?\u201D\
  \n\n\u201COurs\u201D Pui responds. \u201CWe are getting married!\u201D\n\nHaving\
  \ just arrived in a foreign city, with quasi strangers, far away from anything that\
  \ felt remotely familiar, we were now part of the wedding party!\n\nThe next three\
  \ days were a whirlwind of events. We arrived at their home which consisted of a\
  \ two story concrete building, void of windows, doors or running water. For many\
  \ people, we were the first foreigner they had ever seen! I had never met anyone\
  \ so fascinated with my white skin or Allie\u2019s dirty blonde hair. Yet, we were\
  \ welcomed in as family; meaning that along with the perks of being housed and fed\
  \ we were expected to help prepare for the wedding! Countless hours were spent chopping\
  \ green papaya for salad, cleaning fish for stew and flipping Thai doughnuts for\
  \ the entire village to enjoy!\n\nFinally the day had arrived. Pui was dressed in\
  \ her beautiful pink gown, seated under the wedding awning as Boontham dressed in\
  \ his traditional robes was danced into the tent by his friends. The event was like\
  \ nothing I had ever seen, full of joy and communal celebration enjoyed by all.\
  \ It completely redefined the neatly packaged view that I had of a wedding ceremony.\
  \ Towards the end of the evening when everyone was fed and sufficiently intoxicated,\
  \ instead of having a first dance like they do in most western weddings the couple\
  \ had their first Karaoke song, beautifully sealing their marriage vows and the\
  \ commitment they made to one another. And the Karaoke did not stop for the next\
  \ 24 hours.\n\nAs I lay there staring at the ceiling in the house, shaking from\
  \ the blasting karaoke, I was content knowing that a compliment could open my eyes\
  \ to a new way of life so different from mine and yet so happy."
