Text: "Turkey, you can find everything that even you can not imagine. I was born there\
  \ and live but I am still discovering it. Let us start to find something different\
  \ in here. \nThere is a city which is called \xC7orum, in Turkey. In addition, it\
  \ is center of Earth according to the researches. It has a historical district which\
  \ is called Hattusa, also capital of the Hittite Empire. It includes a long history,\
  \ a culture, natural beauties.\nWhen I go there I feel that I am passing another\
  \ country or I am doing time travel. Because it is place like that have truly different\
  \ climate, geography and ambient within a small area.\nCar is climbing the roads\
  \ we are going uphill. I reminded me of the Divine Comedia by Dante. That climb\
  \ has resemblance to the phenomenon in there. The giant beautiful rocks are seen\
  \ with glamorous green trees. Wind is floating on your face, skin. It cause to forget\
  \ the burning sun. You are deeply feeling in there. It is like a time travel for\
  \ me. Your sense of time is fading away. I sensed I leave from world for a moment.\
  \ \n\nThen, at last you reach the history. It is placed top of huge rocky mountain.\
  \ There are lots of sculptures with many beautiful details. History comes to life\
  \ again. You are trying to dream the people, kings, sculptors which live and touch\
  \ there in the past. \n\nThen, when you learn history of Hattusa it becomes more\
  \ worthful. The king of the Hittite is \u2018Hattusili I\u2019 carried the capital\
  \ city to Hattusa. Because, he thought it is pretty precious place. He believed\
  \ that Hattusa has invaluable wealth. Perhaps Hattusa does not have underground\
  \ sources but it has a charming and dizzy natural beauty. Furthermore, Hattusa is\
  \ also called thousand Gods city. It demonstrate how they were universal and respectful.\n\
  I am top of the mountain. All city is under my view. Clouds settled down on the\
  \ horizon. My hairs is flying with soft wind. In that moment, I am missing something\
  \ but I can not know what. A sense in the deep of my heart. I am a lucky one which\
  \ have a chance to see this place, Hattusa. \nNext, it is time to go. Leaving from\
  \ there is really hard. How I can manage this? I know I will make it live in my\
  \ dreams. We are going downhill and my eyes stay behind. We are leaving from there\
  \ on a road which wrapped around."
