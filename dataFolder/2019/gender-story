Text: "Following the signing of the Agreement for the Resolution of the Conflict in\
  \ the Republic of South Sudan, between August and September 2015, and since discussions\
  \ around its implementation began at the National Women\u2019s Peace Dialogue (November\
  \ 2015); more than 500 women from all States of South Sudan have adopted a 7-point\
  \ agenda on how to implement a gender-responsive peace agreement.\nThis adoption\
  \ came at a National Women\u2019s Peace Conference from 25\u201326 May in Juba,\
  \ entitled \u201CWomen Strive for Unity in Diversity\u201D, which drew participants\
  \ from most women\u2019s organizations working on peacebuilding that have been advocating\
  \ for peace in South Sudan.\nThe discussions focused on the importance of integrating\
  \ women\u2019s voices in the implementation of the peace agreement and in the formation\
  \ of the Transitional Government of National Unity (TGoNU).\n\u201CWe are here to\
  \ look at effective strategies to implement the peace agreement, a gender-responsive\
  \ peace agreement! This agreement is not for the Government alone. It is for everybody\
  \ and women are part of the agreement,\u201D said Dr. Priscilla Joseph, founding\
  \ member and Chair of the South Sudan Women\u2019s Peace Network.\nParticipants\
  \ adopted a 7-point agenda, The South Sudan We Want, which will seek to ensure that\
  \ the implementation of the peace agreement includes, and works for, women. They\
  \ also resolved to establish a Women\u2019s Peace Think Tank to monitor gender-responsiveness\
  \ in its enforcement.\nKey recommendations for all parties, detailed in a communiqu\xE9\
  , include the need to:\nFill the 25 per cent quota for women provided for in the\
  \ peace agreement\u2014including in 14 institutions and bodies of government that\
  \ still have no women\u2014and open space for women to compete for the remaining\
  \ 75 per cent of positions;\nImplement the ceasefire in all areas; consult women\
  \ on security reforms, and include women in teams monitoring the ceasefire;\nEnsure\
  \ that the constitutional reform process includes at least 25 per cent women and\
  \ that all members receive gender-sensitization training;\nEnd sexual violence against\
  \ women, girls and boys; establish holistic psychosocial services for survivors\
  \ of violence; and take immediate action to hold perpetrators accountable;\nInclude\
  \ at least 30 per cent women in all institutions for resources, finance and economic\
  \ management, and undertake a land policy review;\nTranslate the agreement; educate\
  \ the public on its contents; and provide peace training and peace dialogue for\
  \ citizens in all States;\nRespect freedom of expression of women and the media.\n\
  Participants also recognized the need to address the root cause of the conflict\
  \ to achieve national reconciliation and healing. UN Women spoke directly to some\
  \ of the participants, about their views on the way forward and what challenges\
  \ they foresee in ensuring the peace agreement is truly gender-responsive.\n\u201C\
  Women need to be one. Our tribe, our party, should be called women. We need to speak\
  \ from the same voice and represent views of all women and the entire nation. \u2026\
  That is why we need to do a lot of lobbying and not get tired of it.\u201D \u2013\
  \ Yolanda Awel Deng, Secretary-General, Women\u2019s League Sudan People\u2019s\
  \ Liberation Movement/In Opposition; and Women\u2019s Block\n\u201CThe adopted strategy\
  \ and the Peace Agreement need to be translated into local languages so that every\
  \ woman, every South Sudanese is able to fully understand what they entail. This\
  \ would speed up the truth and reconciliation process... If women are not fully\
  \ informed then this plan will not hold holistically.\u201D \u2013 Ayak Chol Deng\
  \ Alak, Spokesperson, National Youth Union Suzy Matthew Othow Deng.\n\u201CThe implementation\
  \ of the set quotas should be pushed forward and a system should be put in place\
  \ so that even women in rural areas could be able to understand what the resolutions\
  \ and the Peace Agreement are all about. If this Peace Agreement process is pushed\
  \ with women of South Sudan involved, then things will get done.\u201D \u2013 Suzy\
  \ Matthew Othow Deng, Headquarters Fire Brigade Officer Dolly Anek Odwong.\n\u201C\
  The Government needs to recognize the importance and impact of including women in\
  \ the Peace Agreement. Women should be part of the whole system, even part of the\
  \ Joint Monitoring and Evaluation Commission, and they should not be left behind.\
  \ A country without women and girls does not exist!\u201D \u2013 Dolly Anek Odwong,\
  \ Deputy Chairperson of South Sudan Women\u2019s Peace Network"
