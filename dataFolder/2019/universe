Text: "Her face was smashed by a huge sign that says \u201Cstay away\u201D. Her curiosity\
  \ drove her thoughtlessly. She took a long breath and started climbing down the\
  \ stairs. She was led to a place where air was heavier. As if she could hold it\
  \ with her hands. She touched the ground with her bare feet. A new land where houses\
  \ were carved out of skeletons. With no residents as if it was built for void to\
  \ inhabit it. She stared at her hands to find the color of her skin changing from\
  \ pure white to a gradient of cold colors covering her veins. Her skin was flipped\
  \ and her internal veins started to appear on her outer organs. She walked with\
  \ her gentle nerves touching the air. A drop of water touched her neck. She screamed\
  \ as it felt like actual hell. She felt an urge to give up her sensations to stop\
  \ the pain.She called with a shaky voice \u201CIs there anyone here to help?\u201D\
  \nSilence was the master. She stared at the faces of passers - by for the time span\
  \ of 3000 breath. Creatures looked similar to humans but they were not merely human.\
  \ She glanced quickly to find a pair of hundred and forty eye penetrating her existence.\
  \ She rushed to the first creature she could meet, walking hesitantly. The ground\
  \ was very hot. She gathered the remains of her voice to say \u201CDo you live here?\u201D\
  \ He turned to her with no facial signals of comprehension.\nHe gazed at her intensely.\
  \ She felt hijacked with his pair of eyes. Her soul got narrower. She was able to\
  \ steal a couple of breaths of the heavy air. Trying to move her lips to initiate\
  \ a conversation was impossible. It felt as if her voice ran away from her. She\
  \ felt her soul touching a brown ground between his eyelids. She glanced at the\
  \ world around her to find the rivers with a coffee like color and the trees felt\
  \ like autumn with the brownish leaves. \nShe came back to conscious and noticed\
  \ that his lips were buried under the skin of his face. Two steps backward. She\
  \ escaped before he could blink.\n\nShe found herself in a blue space staring at\
  \ the light around her, at the water particles. She gazed to the right to find a\
  \ skinny woman lying next to her. The woman approached her but remained silent.\
  \ She looked back at the woman. Her left eye was blue as if it was a part of the\
  \ ocean. Her right eye was black like the darkest part of night. She heard herself\
  \ saying to the woman \u201CI think I know you, Do you know me\u201D? The woman\
  \ smiled. A soft music started to play from the direction of the ocean. The woman\u2019\
  s left eye was moving in all directions as if it was dancing with the music. The\
  \ girl blinked twice after that, The woman was gone. \n\nShe noticed a long road\
  \ with green sand. Creatures were covered by black skin. They were all running terrified\
  \ of something. A young girl was sitting under a tree staring at her from a distance.\
  \ She approached until she could smell remains of gunshots coming from the child.\
  \ Her hair was vibrant red like a fire in he head. She had empty eyes with no pupils\
  \ inside. The little girl used her hand to point to a cave emitting light which\
  \ was a few meters away. \n\nThe earth moved to carry her to the cave. She arrived\
  \ at an empty door made of pure gold. It was glowing to the extent that it changed\
  \ the color of air. She called for help but only heard her eco. The walls were cold\
  \ and smooth made of granite. The cave was opaque except for small golden shapes.\
  \ The walls of the cave started getting tighter with her in between. She heard a\
  \ breaking sound close to her ribs. She took a breath as deep as the ocean. The\
  \ ground disappeared, She fell strongly to a deeper earth. She stared at the sky,\
  \ The cave walls closed then disappeared and also did their memory."
