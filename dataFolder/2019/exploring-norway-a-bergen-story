Text: "The best trips often begin with a local connection. In the fall of 2017, two\
  \ of my best friends and I had the opportunity to study abroad in Trondheim, Norway.\
  \ One of our goals was to explore the country as much as possible by planning our\
  \ own trips. One that stands out as particularly special was the very first trip\
  \ we planned together.\n\nWhile we wanted to explore as much as possible, we had\
  \ to keep it within a college student\u2019s budget. This meant either camping or\
  \ staying in an Airbnb. For this first trip, we decided to travel to Bergen in southern\
  \ Norway. From Trondheim (in the middle part of the country), this meant a ten-hour\
  \ drive on winding, bumpy roads. The three of us were new to Norway and had very\
  \ little idea of what we were getting ourselves into. We rented the cheapest car\
  \ we could find, booked an Airbnb and got ready for our first weekend adventure.\n\
  \nThe drive, while brutally long, turned out to be one of the best parts of our\
  \ escapade. Norway is one of the most beautiful countries in the world and driving\
  \ allows you to see many of the in between parts of the landscape that would otherwise\
  \ be missed. We drove over mountains and rivers and through what felt like hundreds\
  \ of tunnels (by chance driving through the longest tunnel in the world, L\xE6rdal\
  \ Tunnel). After ten long hours, we reached our Airbnb, which we soon realized was\
  \ farther from Bergen than we initially thought. It was dark by the time we arrived,\
  \ so we had no idea what to expect when we woke up the next morning.\n\nWe woke\
  \ up the next morning to a beautiful Norwegian day. We were staying in an apartment\
  \ on a sheep farm. We briefly took in our surroundings, met the owner of the farm\
  \ and headed into the city. We enjoyed a day of walking around the city of Bergen\
  \ with its tremendous history dating back as far as the Vikings. In the middle of\
  \ the city, Mount Fl\xF8yen is about an hour hike to the top and gives you a view\
  \ of Bergen and its surroundings. By early evening, we were exhausted and ready\
  \ to head back to the sheep farm. We stopped at the famous fish market, then headed\
  \ back to cook dinner. On the drive back, we had the chance to take in our surroundings.\n\
  \nThe sheep farm was located on a smaller ocean inlet about 30 minutes from downtown\
  \ Bergen. The farm was surrounded by rolling, green hills, and it felt like an escape\
  \ from the bustling outskirts of the city. We ate dinner and headed outside to walk\
  \ around. That evening turned into one of our most memorable experiences of the\
  \ semester.\n\nThe owner was outside with his daughter and was excited to show us\
  \ the farm. He took us to the edge of the sheep pasture, whistled and the sheep\
  \ came running to him. Our two hosts knew each sheep by name. As we were being introduced,\
  \ the owner gave us a quick tutorial (in English) on the business of sheep farming.\
  \ We absorbed as much as we could and realized we were seeing a part of Norway that\
  \ is not apparent to routine tourists. Our experience was exhilarating and a prime\
  \ example of the advantages of leaving the \u201Cbeaten track\u201D. Had we been\
  \ staying in the city, we would have missed the chance to learn about a different\
  \ and fascinating way of life. Our adventure showed me that there is so much more\
  \ to a location than what you see as a \u201Cperipheral\u201D tourist. Driving 20\
  \ hours for a weekend trip was a bit crazy, but the experience was made special\
  \ by discovering a local connection, a connection that created a lasting memory\
  \ and one of the best trips during our time spent abroad."
