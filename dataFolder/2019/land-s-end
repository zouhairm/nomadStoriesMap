Text: "It was the end of 2018. After saving for a year, I was ready for my big trip\
  \ to Europe. I bought train tickets for different countries and started my adventure.\n\
  I visited Madrid, San Sebasti\xE1n, Boudreaux, Paris, Brussels and Bruges, so it\
  \ was time to move towards the Netherlands.\nThe obvious city choice was Amsterdam\
  \ and I loved that city, but I wanted to go somewhere else, somewhere maybe calmer\
  \ maybe crazier. To be honest, I didn\u2019t know much about the Netherlands so\
  \ any city could be a new adventure.\nI looked at the train map, found a little\
  \ dot in the very north and the name: Den Helder. I packed my bag and went north.\n\
  The landscape was one of the mos beautiful ones I have ever seen. Green hills surrounded\
  \ the shore and only after you climbed them were you able to see the sea, the immense\
  \ sea. I walked its streets with little houses with huge windows where you could\
  \ observe their lives, no one covering their windows with curtains. I peaked a little\
  \ bit, people having dinner, kids playing in the living room.\nWherever I walked\
  \ to, people on the street said hi to me. Supermarket employees were patient and\
  \ nice.\nOne day, I walked on the hill towards the harbor. There it was, a submarine,\
  \ a real one. \nMy dad is a submariner so I knew he was going to be excited about\
  \ my discovery. I entered the Marine Museum and visited the submarine. I also learned\
  \ about the history of the Dutch Navy.\nI took pictures of me inside the submarine\
  \ and sent it to my dad. He cried a little bit. I kept walking and I saw a sign\
  \ that read: Land\u2019s End. And I thought, for centuries Dutch adventurers departed\
  \ from this very same place. It was indeed the end of the known world. I couldn\u2019\
  t help but wonder how my little trip intertwined with the dreams of other sailors.\
  \ I was ready to take my next train and start a new journey."
