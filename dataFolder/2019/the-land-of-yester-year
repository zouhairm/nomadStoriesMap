Text: "Once the white knuckle ride of the flight is out of the way you enter a country\
  \ that is not only lost in time but also has the most profound effect on you both\
  \ spiritually and emotionally. The calmness, lack of materialistic things, the smiling\
  \ and welcoming nature of the people  means  that you immediately leave the stresses\
  \ of every day living behind and start to question why we put so much importance\
  \ on what we own. \nNestling in the foothills of the majestic Himalayas, Bhutan\
  \ offers the traveller many opportunities to explore the numerous dzongs where monks\
  \ enjoy sharing their day to day lives and if you are really lucky, get invited\
  \ into their inner sanctum to witness the rhythm of their chants and instruments\
  \ which have a slow, melodic beat that draws you into an almost trance like state.\
  \ The offer of butter tea and maize flakes also makes you feel humbled as you sit\
  \ on the floor with monks as young as 10 who are clearly just happy to be sharing\
  \ with you.\nBy contrast, the colour and flare of the festivals is an event to remember.\
  \ The people from all the surrounding villages come together for song, dance and\
  \ music and perform from dawn until dusk. Jester like characters run around with\
  \ wooden penises, placing them upon the head of locals and tourists as a symbol\
  \ of fertility. The men, dressed in beautiful and bright costumes,with masks of\
  \ animals and spirits, perform dances which are energetic and well rehearsed and\
  \ the women stand in lines singing meaningful and sometimes emotional songs. Young\
  \ locals take pleasure in buying plastic guns and shooting at each other with them\
  \ ( so unfitting for such a calm race) and enjoy the gifts bestowed upon them like\
  \ bubble blowing and lollipops. \nThe driving around the country is very challenging\
  \ at times but one soon forgets the narrow gravel road with a 2000 meter drop as\
  \ you reach your next destination. Staying in local villages gives you the opportunity\
  \ to not only experience traditional home cooked food but also explore the area\
  \ on foot and interact with the locals ( even when language is a barrier).  The\
  \ sound of children playing in the streets with hoops and balls makes one realise\
  \ how quickly times have changed at home and how the next generation are becoming\
  \ so engrossed in materialistic possessions that mean they often do not leave the\
  \ house.\nReturning to the hustle and bustle of everyday life makes one yearn for\
  \ a more simplistic life and leaves you with the feeling of what is this all about\
  \ and where do I really belong?"
