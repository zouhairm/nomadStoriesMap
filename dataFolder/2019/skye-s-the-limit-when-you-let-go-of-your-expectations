Text: "I have always had a very clear vision of my first big solo trip. I would travel\
  \ from castle to castle all across Scotland, taking flawless photos (despite having\
  \ no experience with a legitimate camera) and ending my days unwinding in pubs and\
  \ restaurants in the company of locals that would become lifelong friends. \n\n\
  I don't know how I ever thought I would execute this plan on the salary of a seasonally\
  \ employed food service worker. Still, I went to Scotland this past October because\
  \ I couldn't wait any longer. I had a surface-level Scotland experience six years\
  \ prior to this trip as part of a study abroad program - a unique exchange that\
  \ sent students abroad as first-semester freshmen. That being said, I was far too\
  \ busy being a first-year college student to truly appreciate where I was at the\
  \ time. A return trip had been on my mind from the second my plane landed in New\
  \ York back in 2012, but I thought it would be best to wait for the right time to\
  \ go.\n\nI've since trashed the idea that there is any such thing as the \"right\"\
  \ time. My recent travels through Scotland were limited by my funds, which led to\
  \ some serendipitous adjustments to my original route. I ditched a few stops on\
  \ my twelve-stop itinerary and stayed in Inverness, the largest city in the Highlands,\
  \ for over a week. There was something relaxing about cooking dinner in my hostel\
  \ more nights than I went out, familiarizing myself with local grocery stores, historical\
  \ sites, and anywhere I could get to by foot and explore for free. However, I promised\
  \ myself that I would see the Isle of Skye and made it my mission one night in my\
  \ hostel to arrange that trip.\n\nTo go from Inverness to the Isle of Skye, you\
  \ need a car. There are tour buses available, but some buses don't run during the\
  \ off-season, or run on a very limited schedule, and nearly all of your options\
  \ cost quite a bit of money. Faced with this discovery, I expressed my frustration\
  \ to the few travelers lounging around the hostel. I had just about given up on\
  \ the trip when a German traveller around my age offered to drive me to Skye, as\
  \ it was also on his list. Gauging that he was a non-threatening enough young man,\
  \ I took him up on the offer. \n\nWe departed Inverness early the following morning\
  \ and Thomas, my hero, quickly proved to be one of the most lovely humans I had\
  \ ever met. We swapped stories and blasted Tom Misch while heading down through\
  \ the mountains towards Fort Augustus, stopping for fresh air and photos beside\
  \ the lakes lining the road. I grew up in a valley, but never before had I been\
  \ on such a breathtaking, golden drive. Sidenote: Never let anyone tell you that\
  \ there's no sunshine in Scotland. \n\nOnce in Portree, we grabbed lunch at Cafe\
  \ Arriba and began our route up the east coast of Skye, planning to come back down\
  \ the west side while catching the sunset. We were so distracted by the views of\
  \ the sea that we were startled when we came across The Storr. The Storr is a rocky\
  \ hill with a steep cliff face and is one of the most iconic landscapes in Scotland.\
  \ Knowing that we were extremely lucky to be at The Storr on such a gorgeous day,\
  \ Tom and I decided to embark on the Storr walk. Neither of us were dressed for\
  \ a hike, but we spent about two hours climbing to the highest points accessible,\
  \ basking in our incredible good fortune. \n\nTo sit with a stranger on top of a\
  \ cliff, looking out over rainbows and the vibrant jewel tones of the isles and\
  \ sea was a scenario I never could have envisioned. We followed the sun to the west\
  \ coast, holding our breath as we navigated Tom\u2019s car down the single pass\
  \ roads, dodging more sheep and cows than cars. Two broken shoes, three pints, and\
  \ one stargazing pitstop later, I arrived at my hostel with an experience under\
  \ my belt where reality trumped my daydreams - my newfound definition of success."
