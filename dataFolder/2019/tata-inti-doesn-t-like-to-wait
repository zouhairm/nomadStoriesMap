Text: "July was coming to an end. The narrow, unpaved streets of Amaicha del Valle\
  \ were dark and deserted. The only light I could see was coming from one of the\
  \ low, adobe houses that flanked my limited view. My curiosity, rekindled by the\
  \ array of local chicha drinks offered to me by my landlord, drew me towards the\
  \ sound of zambas and chacareras coming from the place.\nAs I reached the glowing\
  \ entrance to the patio, a man came out of the dark carrying a few logs; my heart\
  \ gave a jump, and I apologized instinctively. \u201CYou looking for someone?\u201D\
  \ he asked, warmly. It was his house.\nTaken aback, I mumbled something about looking\
  \ for the square, wanting to see the Pachamama Day\u2019s celebrations \u2013although\
  \ I had begun to think the town was empty aside from the few inebriated gentlemen\
  \ back at the fonda.\nHe sized me up briefly. \u201CWell, we are just starting ourselves,\
  \ here. Would you care to join us?\u201D he said. \u201CBesides, all you will end\
  \ up seeing at the square is a bunch of drunken tourists.\u201D At that, I did not\
  \ need any more incentive. \u201CMy name\u2019s Daniel Andrade, by the way,\u201D\
  \ he added, shaking my hand. \u201CPleasure to meet you.\u201D\nHis family was gathered\
  \ around a big crackling fire, surrounded by vines and other dry vegetation. Daniel\
  \ introduced me to Celia, his mother, the eldest woman in their little tribe and\
  \ so its most revered member. A moment later, I was offered with a steaming cup\
  \ of rue tea, and the party was resumed.\nI was curious to know about the rites\
  \ that followed these festivities and thinking I might not get a chance to partake\
  \ in what was a much more intimate and religious ceremony, I tried to inquire about\
  \ it, to no avail. All I was told was that the ritual would take place when Inti\
  \ (their sun god) came up from behind the mountains in the East.\nEventually, I\
  \ got a chance to sit with Daniel and talk. I could now observe him more closely.\
  \ His long, dark hair was tied back, showing his brownish, weather-beaten face.\
  \ He had strong features and pitch black eyes that suddenly seemed to me pervaded\
  \ by an immense sadness, even though he was wearing his habitual tired smile.\n\
  I reflected on the fact that he was one of the last descendants of the Calchaqu\xED\
  \ tribes that once populated this vast area of northern Argentina, known today as\
  \ the Calchaqu\xED Valleys \u2013an ancient indigenous people whose population,\
  \ as I would later find out, dropped from almost 450,000 to barely 20,000 by 1650,\
  \ after less than a century of Spanish intervention.\nHe was telling me the word\
  \ Amaicha derives from an old quechua expression meaning \u201Cto come together,\u201D\
  \ and after that night, I could see the spirit with which the village was founded\
  \ was still very much alive. At the same time, however, my mind wandered back to\
  \ a feeling I had gotten before our fortuitous encounter; everywhere I went, the\
  \ town seemed desolate and sorrowful, almost haunted.\nThen, I recalled my brief\
  \ visit to the near site of the Quilmes Ruins, the remains of a settlement whose\
  \ community saw an even worse fate than that of Daniel\u2019s forefathers , and\
  \ a testimony to the brutality with which colonizers stormed these aborigine civilizations\
  \ without a second thought.\nI felt compelled to ask him how it was that they had\
  \ so openly accepted me into their home, offered me drinks and company, when it\
  \ was my own ancestors who had teared apart their cities and families not that long\
  \ ago. I wanted to at least thank him for such a meaningful gesture of forgiveness.\n\
  My expression must have given away my thoughts, however, as he cut me short even\
  \ before I could say anything. \u201CIt\u2019s getting cold, and late,\u201D he\
  \ told me, gently. \u201CWe should get some sleep; the sun will come up in a couple\
  \ of hours.\u201D And then, as if to clear my doubts, he added, playfully: \u201C\
  You\u2019ll have to be here by seven, Tata Inti doesn\u2019t like to wait for anyone.\u201D"
