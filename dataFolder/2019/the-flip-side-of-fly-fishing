Text: "I wiped the grime from my face with a sodden sleeve, but the vicious rain was\
  \ blinding. Thunderous cracks swallowed my whimpers as lightning illuminated bloody\
  \ fingers, broken nails and wrinkled skin. Flopping into the water, I accepted the\
  \ inevitability of giving up. \n\nAt that moment, I was in the Ashley river, in\
  \ Canterbury, New Zealand. Tom and I had driven along this shingle stretch earlier\
  \ with windows down, lungs filled with the perfume of spring flowers, the sunroof\
  \ a square of deep azure blue. Watching him waddle off, waders-deep in the crystal\
  \ clear waters of an excellent fly fishing river, I'd settled into position: feet\
  \ in the flow and nose in a book. This was our happy, slow routine of van life,\
  \ and I'd come to accept the vague answer of: \"Babe, I'll be somewhere 3km upstream\
  \ or downstream from here\" on an almost daily basis. This afternoon had begun like\
  \ most others. \n\nWhat I had not expected was the black wall rolling in from the\
  \ mountains, engulfing the van and me in ominous shadow and wiping out the sun,\
  \ as I obliviously faced downstream. Eyeing it apprehensively, I knew that without\
  \ phone signal there was nothing to do but await Tom's return. So, swapping sunshine\
  \ for a duvet, I sunk once more into the realm of fiction.\n\nPlunk\u2026 Plunk\u2026\
  \ Raindrops as fat and heavy as my book jerked me from The Luminaries' world of\
  \ 19th century Hokitika back to the present. Plunk\u2026 Plunk Plunk PlunkPlunkPlunkplplplplplppppp\u2026\
  \ \n\nMy skin prickled with unease\u2014this river drained large mountainous areas\
  \ of Arthur's Pass and Lake Sumner national parks\u2014and I was a sitting duck.\
  \ \"Thank God!\" when knuckles finally rapped the window; \"I was beginning to think\
  \ your waders had filled up!...\" Now I could begin the task of getting us out of\
  \ there \u2013 pronto. We bumped along, and for some time the incessant rain-hammering\
  \ was only broken by curses and bangs from Tom's attempt to dress in the back. But\
  \ when the front wheels plunged violently into an unseen ditch, we both swore in\
  \ synchrony.\n\nThe next three hours were a blur of desperate digging, without success;\
  \ the wet sand had swallowed us and the wheels were now under a foot of water. The\
  \ river was rising\u2026\n\nWalking away was one of the hardest things I've ever\
  \ done: home, transport, and all our possessions had to be abandoned. After all\
  \ the physical effort, it took deeper\u2014psychological\u2014digging to let go\
  \ and muster the energy to run the few kilometres back to highway 1. Our shaking,\
  \ aching forms finally embraced the solidity of tarmac, but New Zealand roads are\
  \ quiet at the best of times. Imagine: midnight, in a storm\u2026 Occasionally,\
  \ yellow glimmers of hope approached, and passed. Evidently, two utterly bedraggled\
  \ strangers weren't ideal hitchhikers. My faith in humanity faltered. \n\n\"WATCH\
  \ OUT!\" A rainwater tsunami drenched me as a car coming from the other direction\
  \ screeched into a huge handbrake turn, skidding to a halt a few metres ahead like\
  \ something from a film. The window rolled down revealing a grinning young man in\
  \ his early twenties, wearing a rough hoody and camouflage trousers. \"Well that\
  \ was a bit of a laugh ay! Are yous folk lost? Need a lift?!\" We thanked our lucky\
  \ stars. \n\nBefore taking us anywhere, he insisted on 'seeing the damage', so we\
  \ found ourselves unwillingly river bound once more. Shutting my eyes, I prayed\
  \ he could navigate the groundwater without another breakdown. \"Don't worry, it's\
  \ chill \u2013 I like to come down here sometimes to rag this baby about!\" \n\n\
  And that he did. At nail-biting speeds, our van emerged from the darkness. \"Got\
  \ yourself in a right mess haven't ya?!\" he laughed. \"Better chuck some stuff\
  \ in the back and let's skedaddle.\" Not sharing his good humour, I resignedly opened\
  \ the boot:\n\n\t- A rifle\n\t- A dead Possum\n\t- A tow rope !!!\n\nNot what I'd\
  \ expected to find, but apparently such standard Kiwi boot contents that it had\
  \ been forgotten about. His ego practically glowed at the challenge, and miraculously,\
  \ within twenty minutes we were out. \n\nI thought we'd lost everything, but next\
  \ time I'll have more faith \u2013 people are \"sweet as\"."
