Text: "F*cking flies.  Malditas moscas.  Triers of patience and ruiners of good moods,\
  \ capable of pushing the most zen of us over the edge, flies are found in almost\
  \ all countries and climates of the world.  There are many living species (besides\
  \ the obvious human) that I have come to marvel at for their resilience and adaptability\
  \ in the rather unceremonious quest that binds all living organisms together: our\
  \ drive to survive.  My radar however, had failed to register flies as candidates\
  \ of such, nor had my heart ever considered the possibility of admiring these winged\
  \ poop-eating vermin.\nIt's dark and drizzly along the Pacific coast of Baja Sur;\
  \ the low lying winter clouds make it appear like it's 5:00 pm all day long. All\
  \ I could think about on my way back from my chilly morning walk was how very perfect\
  \ a warm mug of hot chocolate cradled in my hands and pressed against my chest would\
  \ be whilst lazing in my cozy little camper van.  Upon return to my house-on-wheels\
  \ however, I opened the sliding side door to reveal a cacophonous cloud of black,\
  \ swarming abomination covering so much of my van's normally beige seats and ceiling\
  \ that the upholstery itself seemed to have come alive.  Instantaneously overwhelmed\
  \ I violently jerked back, and in that moment a lone fly found my left nostril.\
  \  I immediately lost my shit.  A war cry of bilingual expletives ejected from my\
  \ mouth as I grabbed the first article of clothing my hands fell upon\u2014a favorite\
  \ old worn out pink sweatshirt\u2014by the sleeve and began to swing it maniacally\
  \ like a helicopter blade over my head, smacking the ceiling, walls, and windows,\
  \ smearing fly guts everywhere.  My rational brain kicked in after ten seconds and\
  \ I opened the driver and passenger doors so the flies could have an out as I continued\
  \ to wield my cloth weapon in a vain attempt to herd them towards their evacuation\
  \ routes.  The poor bastards kept circling about and insisted on smacking relentlessly\
  \ into the front windshield.  I thought of that Einstein meme that reads that the\
  \ definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting different\
  \ results and wondered if he had ever exorcised a horde of indoor flies (and if\
  \ he in fact had actually said that).  \nIdiots! Can't you see the three open doors\
  \ leading to light and salvation?!? Why the hell do you all incessantly bang your\
  \ bodies against the only unopenable glass window in here? Do you not see there's\
  \ a part of me that\u2019s attempting to save you before the escalating warpath\
  \ side of me takes off her flipflop?  \nFUERA!  I scream at them, half in growing\
  \ anger, half in disbelief, all the while swinging my beloved sweatshirt around\
  \ by the sleeve, feeling much like a psychotic rodeo clown on a rampage, until its\
  \ hood inadvertently caught on the passenger-side headrest and my final yank on\
  \ it tore it along the armpit's seam. \nThen the flipflop came off. \n\nThe slaughter\
  \ is over.  I lie on my mattress in my own private battlefield, flipflop still in\
  \ hand and surrounded by fallen fly cadavers, each a reminder of how I lost my cool.\
  \  Sheepish and ashamed, I reflect on diptera, mosca, fly, and quietly punish myself\
  \ by acknowledging that they are integral pollinators, fabulous decomposers, food\
  \ sources for many animals (and even some carnivorous plants), and no less at fault\
  \ for wanting to survive than my own expansive species.  Punishing myself further,\
  \ I humanize flies and imagine them shrieking in panic, not stopping to contemplate\
  \ the invisible forcefield that was my windshield.  They technically came into my\
  \ van to help me clean it up. \nWho was more insane then: the flies or me, the explosive\
  \ human who inadvertently painted the inside of her van with smeared black, red,\
  \ and cream innards?  Forgive me, winged composters.  At least your stains shall\
  \ serve as a reminder that all forms of life, no matter how gross, play a role in\
  \ our global ecosystem and that I am constantly offered invaluable lessons every\
  \ day from Mother Nature and her Divine Designs; all I have to do is have the willingness\
  \ to perceive them."
