Text: "Building Businesses in Nicaragua: \n\n\nThe largest and second safest country\
  \ of Central America.  Nicaragua or Republic of Nicaragua as its officially known\
  \ as. The land of Coffee, Rum and Cigars. \nWhen you arrive in Nicaragua, you will\
  \ be overwhelmed by the humidity, the mass of taxi drivers, and the sudden change\
  \ of time zones. \n\nOh well that\u2019s why I\u2019m here, to discover the true\
  \ Nicaragua, The Heart of Central America\n\nCold bucket showers, Long drops and\
  \ rice and beans for breakfast are just a few things that made this trip memorable.\
  \  It all began on a cold, dark winter morning in February when we were heading\
  \ to the deepest depths of Nicaragua with a full ICSE team.  People choose ICSE\
  \ (International Citizen Service Entrepreneur) programme as a personal development.\
  \ I chose to work with Raleigh International - a sustainable development charity\
  \ that tackles health, environment and poverty issues in different program schemes,\
  \ to discover not only to go on a personal development journey but to discover the\
  \ raw beauty of Nicaragua and by doing something good at the same time by allowing\
  \ young entrepreneurs to enter the programme, a team of ICSE volunteers help them\
  \ to make a business idea into a successful business plan. We work with them for\
  \ 3 months to initialise, develop and promote their plan to becoming successful\
  \ business leaders for their community.  \n\n15 hours and a lay-over in Houston\
  \ later, over packed and onion layered with winter clothing, we arrived in the humidity\
  \ of Managua. Quick four hour sleep and its back on the road -next destination:\
  \ Esteli - 150km north of Managua. Land of cigars.   \u2018Where have you come from\
  \ and What do you want to get out of this were  very common questions amongst my\
  \ other fellow travellers travelling north to Esteli in a classic yellow school\
  \ bus, where we were to spend a week training before being known which communities\
  \ we were to be based at for the next three months. \n\n Coyolito y Chichicaste\
  \ - Communities with a view! \n\nArriving at the bottom of the hill, I inhale and\
  \ exhale deeply ready for the steep climb to the community houses.  The first few\
  \ corners I steamed on ahead as if i would reach the top in no time. All those times\
  \ cycling uphills back in the UK, I thought this should be a breeze with no push-bike\
  \ to manage and only a 50L backpack to carry. \n\nWhich soon I was to be proved\
  \ wrong! \n\nWe\u2019d flown into Managua a week before to acclimatise to the humidity\
  \ and dramatic change of time zones. Chugging water at every sign of desperation\
  \ became a subconscious need to mentality nourish my body for the stony path and\
  \ to keep me from dehydration. Quite frankly, I wasn\u2019t quite as ready as I\
  \ initially thought and I hadn\u2019t paced myself. \nI really  wanted to get to\
  \ know the community family members but \u2018Ya llegamos?\u2019 is all I could\
  \ manage under exhausted breathe just to conserve any remaining energy I had left\
  \ to be used for every step to reach the top. \n\nAbout half way up and with my\
  \ hands on my knees to catch my breathe, a younger kid (who I later discovered was\
  \ to be my younger brother for the next three months) skipped past me carrying more\
  \ luggage than his own body weight, \n\u2018Casi llegamos\u2019 as he bounced on\
  \ ahead of me as the older ladies behind me carrying bed frames and mattresses clearly\
  \ in their late fifties snickered back. \n\nCoyolito - Northwest Nicaragua. High\
  \ up in the mountain side under the true depths of Nicaraguan skies. I've never\
  \ felt closer to the stars as I have here. This is where I\u2019ll be based for\
  \ the next three months.  Back in the UK, 6 am starts was a chore, however when\
  \ you have the rooster,  palm-slapping tortillas being made, the chopping of the\
  \ wood and the wood-burning smoke pouring through your \u2018bedroom\u2019 walls,\
  \ it\u2019s like setting four different alarms on your smartphone just to miss that\
  \ pre-commute rush."
