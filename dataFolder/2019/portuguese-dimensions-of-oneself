Text: "Whenever one travels or lives abroad there is a huge chance of finding other\
  \ dimensions of the self on that unknown places. I want to tell the story of that\
  \ girl that had a Portuguese name and family \u2013 Maria Almeida Moro -, but had\
  \ no connections with Portugal, thought Portuguese people there were obtuse and\
  \ close minded, never had stopped to listen to a Fado and had an awful first impression\
  \ of Portuguese people when she was stopped at costumers accused of illegal immigration\
  \ and to be a prostitute just because she was born Brazilian. Maria had suffered\
  \ a terrible trauma back in Brazil \u2013 her beloved brother committed suicide\
  \ in front of her, not standing anymore the prejudice against his sexual choices\
  \ \u2013 and she feels she has no home anymore, since her family is destroyed by\
  \ that tragedy and she feels like he has taken with him a deep part of her soul.\
  \ At first, she had this chocking experience when arriving in Portuguese soil, but,\
  \ through Portuguese Literature, she was able to cross that difficult bridge of\
  \ uncertainty and disillusion. She found other dimensions of herself walking amid\
  \ strangers, visiting the no place of being a foreigner in a country where one speaks\
  \ the same language but cannot communicate."
