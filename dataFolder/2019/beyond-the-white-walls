Text: "Here I am again, struggling to pour those words out just as I did a few months\
  \ ago. Surrounded by white walls, admiring the daffodils glowing as the sunlight\
  \ peered through the window pane. Boredom had built a shack in my brain, waking\
  \ up every day to fuel myself up for hours on the laptop, envying those out on isolated\
  \ lands, smiling with people they had never met the day before. I wanted to be there,\
  \ I wanted to imbue myself with the stories people shared as I made my way through\
  \ unfamiliar narrow streets. After a motivational conversation with the woman of\
  \ my dreams, I pleaded my brother for his bag, packed the house and booked a one-way\
  \ ticket to sleepless nights, a broken 128GB memory card and one hell of a site\
  \ to dive off, I was a lost soul backpacking to the south of France. \n\nIt was\
  \ 5 a.m. and I was on my way to a popular yet surprisingly deserted spot in Marseille\
  \ - Calanque de Sugiton. Proposed to me by a fellow passenger, if I was looking\
  \ for an experience, tourists steer clear of, this was it. And she was right! Following\
  \ the rocks marked by red crosses, I embarked on a 2 hr long journey to the top\
  \ of the hill and down to the other side. I could hear it, the blue water crashing\
  \ into the rocks that surround it, I knew this was it, I was going to jump off a\
  \ cliff. And I did! All it cost me was my phone and a toenail. After a few days\
  \ of sharing a snack with the kind people of Marseille I was back on the road with\
  \ a group of 3 awesome women who were kind enough to take me to the coastal city\
  \ of France - La Rochelle. The infant sun had flooded the streets with a golden\
  \ hue, I was dumbfounded by the beauty that embraces your senses and all it asks\
  \ for you is to get off the bed at 5.\n\nAfter walking a thousand steps I was famished,\
  \ so I told myself just around that last corner, then I\u2019d go grab a baguette\
  \ and sip on a small cup of caf\xE9. Little did I know there existed a place as\
  \ I had never seen before. A caf\xE9 that felt like home, tables covered by magnificent\
  \ and intriguing works, walls decorated by 18th-century maps, corners hidden by\
  \ rare brass lamps and nightstand complimented by glowing globes. Bricolites, a\
  \ place where an invaluable is turned valuable again. I followed the scent of freshly\
  \ brewed coffee, \u201CIs this a caf\xE9?\u201D, I asked, not sure whether I was\
  \ trespassing or not. \u201CYes! Come in.\u201D, a voice echoed from the kitchen.\
  \ Naomi guided me to a small room surrounded by vintage bookshelves and a lot of\
  \ offbeat items begging me to observe and unfold the stories it held. After an insightful\
  \ conversation with Emmanuel and Naomi, Emmanuel introduced to his workshop. A place\
  \ where he brought in all that was broken and sold at flea markets and gave them\
  \ a new purpose in his artwork or sometimes fixing it completely, adding a few years\
  \ to its life. He explains why it meant a lot to him and he emboldens the use of\
  \ his workshop by other creators to explore their ideas and construct them. His\
  \ desk felt like a novel with each square inch representing pages from a book yet\
  \ to be formed. Bricolites felt like a place I dream to call home. \n\nI was finally\
  \ there, I did it! I was among people who never knew me a day before but now make\
  \ me feel nostalgic. I had discovered places I\u2019d never find on the web, I met\
  \ people who inspired me and I walked a thousand steps to catch up to myself in\
  \ the realm of fantasy."
