  \ woman traveler sitting next to me. \n\u201CI think this is a scam.\u201D She repeated.\
  \ \u201CI read about it online. The travel office you buy your bus ticket from takes\
  \ your money, pockets it, and puts you on a bus with bags of rice, chickens, and\
  \ all local people.\u201D\nThere were no chickens, but definitely a lot of boxes\
  \ shoved under seats, stacked in the aisle, in any overhead space available, mostly\
  \ locals and at least one bag of rice.\n\u201CI bought a ticket for a VIP bus. I\
  \ think this is a scam, but I don\u2019t know what to do.\u201D\n\nWe woke before\
  \ dawn. Standing on the curb, we waited for the transport to our bus heading to\
  \ Vietnam from Paske, Laos. Andrew, the family expatriate and my eldest brother,\
  \ and I stood with our backpacks in front of the rundown hotel where the night clerks\
  \ laid curled up sleeping in the lobby. \u201CHow are we going to contact the guy\
  \ who sold us the tickets this early if no one shows up for us?\u201D I ask into\
  \ the crisp morning. Silence. A cold breeze picks up. A black sedan rolls up and\
  \ stops right next to us. There is no move to speak to us or take us to the bus\
  \ station. One bus a day leaves Pakse and crosses into the Vietnam border. I prayed\
  \ we wouldn\u2019t miss the bus. We had a list of things missed while traveling\
  \ together. We missed a plane in Chiang Mai,. We missed multiple turns cruising\
  \ on a motorcycle exploring the Bolaven Plateau. We missed a river taxi in Bangkok.\n\
  \nA truck pulled up. Mostly Laotian and Vietnamese, but there were two young European\
  \ women among the crowd of faces packed in the truck bed staring out into the morning.\
  \ We wedged ourselves into the crowd. As the truck pulled away, I stared out of\
  \ the back hoping I wouldn\u2019t fall into the street. Eventually, we made it to\
  \ the van that would take us to Vietnam. Cramming inside the driver\u2019s helper\
  \ directed me to the back row. I cringed at the thought of every bump and curve\
  \ I would feel sitting wedged between my brother and the Finnish woman at the tail\
  \ of the van. \u201CCan\u2019t I sit in another spot?\u201D The driver\u2019s helper\
  \ ignored me as he directed others where to take a seat. The journey through the\
  \ wet, muddy jungle of Vietnam had me wondering about the war. I saw remnants of\
  \ that time in the military uniforms at the immigration checkpoint and in the simple\
  \ questioning room where I was asked about my citizenship. Laotian women carried\
  \ an ATM in their purse. In a quick transaction your kip becomes dong. Yet, it was\
  \ with the lone dollar I had in my wallet, I paid to use the restroom, not knowing\
  \ if we would ever stop again. Trying to buy one pack of crackers, I am forced to\
  \ buy a whole dozen. Everything feels lost in translation and the man in the military\
  \ uniform shakes his head at me every time I attempted to ask a question. Tracking\
  \ in mud, we piled back into the rundown van continuing full speed. I down one of\
  \ my many packs of crackers, it will be all I eat that day. After eight hours and\
  \ a guardian angel, who enjoyed practicing his English with us and generously ordered\
  \ us an uber, we made it to our hotel in Da Nang. My head ached. My body questioned\
  \ the journey. \n\nIt came on fast, the wave in my stomach. \u201CSign here.\u201D\
  \ I signed the receipt quickly. Clenching my jaw I ran out into the rain. Leaning\
  \ over the curb, the wave came rushing out of me, joining the downpour flowing through\
  \ the street. Suddenly, I noticed a pair of black sneakers next to me. Once the\
  \ wave and the pain in my head subsided, I looked up. The hotel lobby guy was holding\
  \ an umbrella over me. A simple gesture held with care and kindness. I was VIP."
