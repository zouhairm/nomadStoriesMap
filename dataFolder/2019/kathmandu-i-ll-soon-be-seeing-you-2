Text: "In 1975, near a Tibetan monastery at 13,000\u2019 in the Himalayas, my mother\
  \ and father, age 21, met, discovered they shared the same birthday, and fell in\
  \ love. So in 2017, during a thirty-hour bus ride from New Delhi to Kathmandu, I\
  \ secretly hoped to cross paths with my own soul mate. Instead, I found a Nepalese\
  \ family and a shamanistic ceremony waiting for me.\n \nWhen I reached Kathmandu,\
  \ two Nepalese sisters welcomed me into their home. Under a full moon, we fasted\
  \ and cleansed for the goddess Shree Swasthani. We laughed with neighbors, prayed\
  \ with monkeys by rivers, and went from temple to temple with red dye on our foreheads.\
  \ The next day, in the nearby town, Bhaktapur, we bought matching turquoise bracelets,\
  \ and my Nepalese sister taught me the word, aatmiya sathi,  \u201Csoul mate.\u201D\
  \ Though I didn\u2019t find my soul mate, as my parents had, this new sisterhood\
  \ would do. \n \nMy journey to Solukhumbu was cold but beautiful. At last minute\
  \ I\u2019d joined a weeklong trek into the foothills of the Mount Everest. Our mornings\
  \ greeted us with Himalayan peaks bathed in the candescent sun. We trekked past\
  \ mossy rocks, golden brown cows, blooming rhododendrons, and breezes carrying the\
  \ smell of pine trees and sweet orchids. Our afternoons included weaving through\
  \ endless trails of frosty ferns past stones engraved with mantras like \u201COm\
  \ Mani Padme Om.\u201D We stopped at clay houses with blue wooden roofs and drooped\
  \ marigold flower chains to converse over Tibetan bread, dal, and black tea. Our\
  \ evenings were cold but beautiful.  \n \nOne morning, we climbed (ogalo) and descended\
  \ (oralo), crossed a suspension bridge, and then ascended up up up. It felt as if\
  \ I were flying from one mountainside to another, like in the western Nepali song\
  \ \"risum phreedeedee.\u201D At times I climbed alone, but never entirely alone,\
  \ encountering local women carrying wood on their backs. On a stone bench between\
  \ two pine trees, I sat and breathed Om into the wind. I turned to my left and suddenly\
  \ there was a man with blood dripping from his cheeks standing on a rock. After\
  \ a nervous \"Namaste,\" I looked away, and then turned around to find he\u2019\
  d disappeared, leaving me to wonder if he had been real. Higher and higher we went,\
  \ finally reaching Lokhim, hometown of our guides Jagat and Nanda. And I felt as\
  \ if were transported into a fairy tale. Cottages; cows, pigs, and chickens; banana\
  \ trees, coffee plants, and children playing volleyball.\n \nWe arrived at a two-hundred-year\
  \ old clay home for a simple meal: bananas, sweet potatoes, and coffee. We met Jagat's\
  \ family - who was basically the entire village and the next.  In the room where\
  \ Jagat and Nanda were born, their grandfather's shaman drums hung in corner, not\
  \ to be touched. As the sun sank below the mountains, we sipped Roxy (Millet rum),\
  \ sang, and danced. That evening, their mother tucked me into bed- I couldn\u2019\
  t remember the last time I was tucked in bed - curing my homesickness. Grateful\
  \ to have found this home away from home, I drifted into a dream of ice covered\
  \ Himalayan cliffs. \n\nThe next day: a farewell dance, the taste of Chang, more\
  \ dancing, and their thanks to us \u201Cwho have come from across the horizon!\u201D\
  \ In the neighboring village, we spent the day with a healing Shaman, who danced,\
  \ banged beaded drums, hummed mantras, and \u201Cflew,\u201D calling spirits from\
  \ all over Nepal. He performed a ritual that involved slicing a holy ginger root\
  \ charred with coal in order to tell our fortunes. If the sliced ginger landed coal\
  \ side up three times, it meant catastrophe. If it landed with the white side up\
  \ twice, it meant good luck. Nanda\u2019s face fell when he listened to the prediction\
  \ of his daughter and parents\u2019 misfortunes. To my inner horror, this led to\
  \ them sacrificing a baby pig and rooster to keep the demons at bay. The next day\
  \ was \u201Cmarket day.\u201D As we wandered through stalls, I relived the ritual.\
  \ \n\nI carried these memories of Nepali culture \u201Cacross the horizon,\u201D\
  \ leaving a piece of my heart in Lokhim as I journeyed back to my sisters in Kathmandu."
