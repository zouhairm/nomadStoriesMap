Text: "Traveling and running are awesome hobbies for me. Traveling, I love and enjoy\
  \ do the trip but actually I hate sports until I found some reason to do - healthy\
  \ and I can eat anything. I ever pretended to faint when my teacher told to relay\
  \ run, once I hit by basketball because I don\u2019t perform the dribble technique\
  \ well, and also my school report got bad result for this subject. I laugh when\
  \ I imagine that happened in my school time LOL. Time passed, some of my friend\
  \ are appalled that I bring a running shoes every traveling or work meeting. \n\
  I'm just an ordinary runner, not a PACER. I do it in between work time which is\
  \ quite dense. I usually choose the time to run in the evening or early morning\
  \ of the day. Why I choose to run instead of other sports? It is cheaper than others.\
  \ In my addition, I work area in a rectangular chamber \u2013 sometimes I felt a\
  \ bit stuck of productivity. I need space to move more freely and it can be done\
  \ in this round place because we have the earth for free natural space. I would\
  \ like to prefer the run in a city jogging track or on a road with nature view.\
  \ \nMostly, make a running movement is difficult for newbie like me. I feel very\
  \ slow, get easily tired and bored. Setting the time when I wake up in the morning\
  \ or after work in the evening is like an exam of my running plan. \nBut when I\
  \ look at the numbers on the scales with no hard diet that remains me to do this\
  \ sport. Running is not a matter of a quick finish or a medal also, but I had to\
  \ train myself to achieve consistency of goals. These goals are my medals. Not only\
  \ that, I build a network through friendships among fellow runners. I run through\
  \ a lot of reunited friends who have similar goals, eventually I met a coach who\
  \ remind, help, and support me to keep the spirit of running.\nWhen I choose this\
  \ subject, I realize that I have to prepare my self before. It is going to be my\
  \ first run out of my country. Writing my traveling while running. I browsed about\
  \ Portugal and found some information about running activity in this country. For\
  \ example, Lisbon has some place for running, jogging track, and of course delicious\
  \ food. About the weather on August, Portugal has similar temperature condition\
  \ like Indonesia. It is about 15-30 degrees Celsius. \nI hope I can discover this\
  \ country while running. It isn\u2019t easy, is it? But let\u2019s do the best and\
  \ let God do the rest. \nDoing these two things-traveling and running at the same\
  \ time in around the world always be my dream make it happen. It is a special reason\
  \ for me, telling how consistency wins."
