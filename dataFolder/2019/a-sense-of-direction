Text: "If you were to ask anyone close to me to list a quirk I have, it would most\
  \ likely fall along the lines of, \u201Cthat girl has got a HORRIBLE sense of direction\u201D\
  .\n\t\nIt\u2019s true. I get lost anywhere and everywhere. I have gotten lost in\
  \ the town in which I grew up. The population of this town, by the way, barely hovers\
  \ above 2,000 people.\n\nAnother defining characteristic of myself is that I am\
  \ obsessed with travelling. As an eight year old child, captivated by my globe one\
  \ day, I discovered that the capital of Morocco is \u201CRabat\u201D. I giggled,\
  \ thinking it sounded like \u201Crabbit\u201D. I then told myself I would visit\
  \ this city someday. Twenty-some years later, I kept that promise.\n\nNow, the nice\
  \ thing about having a truly terrible sense of direction is that it makes for care-free\
  \ travelling. I get lost all the time, so I do not find it stressful at all being\
  \ in a new environment. I will get lost; this is a fact. I am used to it; it does\
  \ not faze me.  Getting lost allows me to see things that other people may not.\
  \ My sense of direction, or lack of it, is a gift. \n\n My first stop in Morocco\
  \ brought me to Casablanca, Morocco\u2019s largest city. My first full day there\
  \ I just walked and walked, exploring the city on foot. I\u2019m not sure in which\
  \ direction I went; in fact, I think by the end of the day I must have gone in every\
  \ direction. An app which tracks my physical activity told me that by the end of\
  \ the day, I had walked 39,097 steps, or 28.4 kilometers. \n\nWhat surprised me\
  \ most about Casablanca was its truly amazing street art. The first piece of art\
  \ I stumble across covers an entire building. The main focus of the painting is\
  \ a girl, wearing a red dress. Though she is young, she is physically a giant, her\
  \ enormous feet larger than the cars and busses below her. Her physical being towers\
  \ high above the buildings of the city. Her hands cover her ears, as she tries to\
  \ block out the sounds of the city. Despite her size, the city is still too loud\
  \ for her. \n\nAnother fascinating art piece is of a boy, hunched over with a wearied\
  \ look on his face. There is a key in his back, like a wind-up toy. He is completely\
  \ surrounded by various social medial logos. He is helplessly controlled by them.\
  \ \n\nYet another piece of art covers the entire side of a building near a market.\
  \ An elderly veiled woman is hunched over with a cane. On her back she is carrying\
  \ an entire city. \n\nThese art pieces conveyed powerful social messages. Though\
  \ localized, they were applicable to society in general. I may have been in another\
  \ continent, but with these visual cues I felt very much at home. The art, to my\
  \ delight, was not limited to Casablanca. In Rabat (or \u201CRabbit\u201D, as a\
  \ young Janel would say), I walked around the capital like it was an art museum.\n\
  \nIn Rabat, I randomly (how else?) end up in a market, and see a group of woman\
  \ rummaging through a bin of clothes. Each item in the bin is 35 Moroccan dirham,\
  \ which is about the equivalent of $5 Canadian Dollars. I quickly run over and join\
  \ in.\n\nTen minutes later I am the proud owner of a sweatshirt featuring a cartoon\
  \ picture of the famous German fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld. \u201CKarl\u201D\
  \ is written under the picture, in English. Underneath that, in Arabic, I am told,\
  \ is the word \u201Chandsome\u201D. How on earth did a shirt like this come to be?\
  \ I wanted to know everything about it. It remains, to this day, one of my prized\
  \ possessions. I wear it regularly, despite the fading (it was only 35 dirham, after\
  \ all).\n\nI ended up travelling around Morocco for two weeks, visiting different\
  \ cities and towns. At each location, I had experiences just as rich as the ones\
  \ I have described above. And at each turn, I was unconditionally thankful for my\
  \ terrible sense of direction."
