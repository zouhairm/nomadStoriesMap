Text: "Most people think that the landscape is the main factor makes you enjoy your\
  \ travel. But, I found out that who you travel with is more important. To escape\
  \ from the boring job without any motivations, we decided to book flights to Da\
  \ Nang in one second. Three of us, we didn\u2019t have any plan for our travel.\
  \ We just wanted to go there. But, never before have had I had a good feeling for\
  \ this trip. \n Arriving in Da Nang at midnight, we tried to borrow a minsk bike\
  \ from the owner of the hostel to ride around the city. And, we all knew why people\
  \ call this place the most worth-living city in Vietnam. It\u2019s a tourist city\
  \ but not tourists at all. All stores close at 11. And, the streets are peaceful\
  \ and clean. We stopped at a store. We all thought this store is dedicated to clothes\
  \ only. But, not until the trip ended, we knew that it\u2019s a caf\xE9. \nThere,\
  \ we met a really cool guy. He\u2019s local so he knows everything about this city.\
  \ And, this lovely guy was willing to be our guide although he is not unemployed.\
  \ He showed us the place to have the best Mi Quang in Da Nang. No tourists know\
  \ because it\u2019s located in a small and zigzag alley. Then, we had coffee in\
  \ a caf\xE9 where we couldn\u2019t find any tourists. We all felt that we had great\
  \ luck ever. \nDa Nang is so small and there are lots of bridges. We crossed the\
  \ most beautiful bridge in Da Nang to reach the other side of this city \u2013 Son\
  \ Tra peninsula. I can say that this part of the city is extremely different from\
  \ the other. Most of the scenery we admired is forest, mountains, and a long coastal\
  \ line. Riding around this peninsula only took us 30 minutes. We stopped on a beach\
  \ where local use for barking their ships. It\u2019s a good place to dive. However,\
  \ we didn\u2019t because we don\u2019t know this interesting sport. \nAt the end\
  \ of the day, we headed to Hoi An \u2013 the most amazing ancient town in Vietnam.\
  \ We missed our bus. But, it brought us luck when we met a nice driver who was willing\
  \ to drive us to Hoi An with a little extra fee. We were all tired but still tried\
  \ to figure out what we would do that night. I can say that there is nothing better\
  \ than traveling with my girls.\nHoi An is nostalgia and memories. The whole old\
  \ quarter is preserved really well although I found out that they changed a little.\
  \ The streets are organized to lead to the small river. All wooden houses are in\
  \ good conditions. We walked around this area the whole night. And, we ended up\
  \ sitting in a bar. It\u2019s a Hoi An-style bar. We are not allowed to smoke because\
  \ this bar is a wooden house. \n We spent the next day to discover every corner\
  \ of Hoi An. Actually; we walked around and found the places where everyone takes\
  \ photos. Faifo caf\xE9 is the place that we all see people taking pictures of Hoi\
  \ An from above. This place serves nice coffee and teas, too. There is a small alley\
  \ which is opposite to this caf\xE9. This alley is also a nice background. I recommend\
  \ you to wake up early in the morning before all the stores and shops open to take\
  \ photos. \nWe tended to visit Cu Lao Cham island in the afternoon; however, we\
  \ missed it because we had to come back to Da Nang for the flight in early morning.\
  \ Our last night in Da Nang was amazing. We also met lots of new friends who are\
  \ really cool. We chilled out at a local pub while we all were thinking about finding\
  \ a job in Da Nang. \nIt was a flash trip. We rushed for everything on this trip.\
  \ But, we all had a good time there. After this short vacation, one of my friends\
  \ moved to Spain for the Aupair program. And, we already had a plan for the next\
  \ trip when she comes back."
