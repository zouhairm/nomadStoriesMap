Text: "Papua New Guinea (PNG) is a wild and wonderful country. From sweeping, cloud\
  \ covered mountain ranges to tiny atolls freckling its seas, extraordinary biodiversity\
  \ and a rich history and culture, PNG demands a full range of emotion unlike any\
  \ other country I've ever been to.\n\nI first worked in PNG in 2015, developing\
  \ an emergency response to a crippling drought caused by that year\u2019s El Ni\xF1\
  o weather event. It was tough work because we were developing a program that would\
  \ eventually criss-cross the highlands and stretch from the border lands of Daru-Kiunga,\
  \ down to where the Highland ranges plummet towards the sea. Eventually the program\
  \ would bring a short term relief to the many who had lost so much from the record\
  \ breaking cold, dry weather, a mere band-aid in the relentless march of climate\
  \ change.\n\nMy colleagues at the time were a wonderfully warm, fiercely proud and\
  \ intellectually savvy bunch of women - a spice farmer\u2019s daughter turned Protection\
  \ specialist, a young mother whose childhood home perched at the base of an active\
  \ volcano gave her a passion for humanitarian work, an Indian nun transplanted many\
  \ decades before to a tiny corner of the Highlands, whose heart and soul now firmly\
  \ belonged to the red soils of PNG. On the eve of my first trip, I was nervous,\
  \ as well I should have been. This is not a country to take lightly. But having\
  \ these women beside me, sharing their stories and their secrets about PNG quickly\
  \ turned my trepidation into fascination and a life-long love affair was born.\n\
  \nI\u2019ve only visited a handful of times and I didn't make it very far into the\
  \ country: consultations in Port Moresby; training workshops on the edge of the\
  \ sea in Madang; and a few team meetings in sturdy old church buildings in Mount\
  \ Hagen. But it was enough to get under my skin and leave me with indelible memories\
  \ I will carry with me for life.\n\nThe first time my tiny plane circled down into\
  \ Mt Hagen, the lush, green mountaintop valley not yet touched by the harsh drought\
  \ that was creeping up the ranges. Sitting outside at the Highlander Hotel, watching\
  \ creamy clouds spill over the sides of the ranges like an overflowing cappuccino.\
  \ A highland storm spitting lightening strikes so close the whole hotel would shake.\
  \ The next day we saw the twisted remains of its unfortunate victim over on the\
  \ Catholic mission, a still smoking charred stump where just yesterday had stood\
  \ a decades old tree. \n\nSheets of rain sweeping across the bay in Madang, as we\
  \ sat at the end of a long day, languidly slapping away mosquitos and watching as\
  \ the lights of the fish processing plant shimmered in and out of the low clouds.\
  \ The haunting and uplifting chorus of daily Mass echoing across the still, early\
  \ morning sea.\n\nThe excitement of the 40th anniversary of independence, as shared\
  \ pride in a diverse country lit up the streets and skies of Port Moresby in celebration.\
  \ An explosion of national culture converging on the streets of the capital. The\
  \ unexpected sight of an Asaro Mud Man in full dress of clay mask and body paint,\
  \ bow and arrows slung over a shoulder, dropping in to see a friend at our hotel.\
  \ He stood and stared at us ominously for a moment, before chuckling and waving\
  \ jovially as he slipped out into the night, clearly taking great delight at the\
  \ shock on the faces of the two white women at the bar.  \n\nEverywhere I go in\
  \ the South Pacific, I am constantly reminded that there is so much more to the\
  \ world than we know. I sometimes whimsically refer to this as magic, but in reality,\
  \ this is just our vast and wonderful planet. These days my work doesn't take me\
  \ to PNG but its hooks are still there, deep inside me, waiting for the day the\
  \ magic calls me back."
