Text: "What is there in a name if not to differentiate Tom from Dick and Harry from\
  \ John? Yet, inspite of all the difference in names, when Dick died they did not\
  \ fail to bury Tom because they both looked alike. So, just try to guess the dilemma\
  \ of a stranger, who in his efforts to reach Tagore Park, finds himself parked at\
  \ Tagore Garden ; after this happened a score of times to my guests, I decided to\
  \ develop the habit of adding a post-script to all my friends and relatives instructing\
  \ them to insist upon 'park' when they get to Delhi and not be led away by the people\
  \ who say \"after all 'park' and 'garden' means the same.\"\n\nActually Dame Delhi\
  \ after being built and rebuilt nine times, has either run out of names or become\
  \ slightly hoyti-toyti in its mind.All the leaders, historical characters and general\
  \ array of names fighting for attention of the illustrious Dame have scattered themselves\
  \ all over the city. One finds alike names at the most unlike places and distances.\
  \ Sardar Patel has, undoubtedly, reserved a large part of the city to himself. There\
  \ is Patel Nagar and connected to it is Patel Marg. Now, that is quite acceptable\
  \ because a person on Patel Marg knows he is somewhere in the vicinity of Patel\
  \ Nagar. But how does one justify the existence of Sardar Patel Marg connecting\
  \ Dhaula Kuan and Willington Crescent or another Sardar Patel Marg running parallel\
  \ to Maurice Nagar off Mall Road in North Delhi? And where do you suppose is the\
  \ famous Patel Chest Institute? Nowhere near Patel Nagar, I assure you. It is near\
  \ the Delhi University. \n\nAnother mischief maker is the Panchsheel, Panchsheel\
  \ Marg, Panchsheel Park, Panchsheel Colony. Scattered artistically all over the\
  \ southern part of Delhi, can lead a person to a fine merry-go-round. Once, there\
  \ was a sale of miscellaneous impoted goods advertised in a Local newspaper. The\
  \ address given was a house in Panchsheela ( just that, mind you, no colony, no\
  \ marg, nothing). So, after a hurried morning tea, I started for the place. Myself,\
  \ being being unaware of the jigsaw puzzle of this South Delhi city, enquired innocently\
  \ at the bus stop and was directed to board a bus that took me to Panchsheel Marg\
  \ in Chanakya Puri. There I walked from one end to the other unable to locate the\
  \ house. Then, I boarded another bus and, after much harrasment and several enquiries,\
  \ finally landed at the correct address looking like something the cat found in\
  \ Tutankhaman's Tomb, around mid-afternoon. There, a pretty girl informed me that\
  \ the sale was over, while an equally pretty dog blinked from the folds of a deep\
  \ sofa. I blinked back & walked sedately out.\n\nMy only consolation is that others,\
  \ in the same circumstances, would look like I did or may be worse. Add to this,\
  \ a handful of Vivekananda Margs, Mandir Margs and Church Roads and you have Dame\
  \ Delhi in all her eccentricities. As for schools and colleges, like their students,\
  \ they have a way of being where you least expect them. The Indraprasta College\
  \ is nowhere near Indraprasta Estate. Inspite of so many Sardar Patel Margs, The\
  \ Sardar Patel School stands all by itself in Lodi Estate.\n\nIf you have had enough,\
  \ you would learn to be suspicious of names. Names are not to trusted in Delhi."
