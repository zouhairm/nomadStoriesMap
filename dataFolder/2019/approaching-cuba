Text: "Given my travel resum\xE9 (33 countries, Communist states included), I approached\
  \ Cuba with the same strategy as I do every other country... with a general concept\
  \ of the socio-political climate, purchasing power parity, list of things to do\
  \ and places to visit (non-tourist areas included) and best social practices.  Like\
  \ most third world countries I expected to see poverty, grafiti, and black market\
  \ businesses however with Cuba something was different , there was no barter culture\
  \ nor desire to produce/ contribute to individual livelihood; unlike travel to other\
  \ communist states such as China and Vietnam, Cuba was unique for one reason, their\
  \ extensive economic censorship. \n\nOne of my favorite aspects of traveling has\
  \ always been the public transportation system...getting by the way the locals do\
  \ albeit bikes, motors, horses, etc... the reason being its the perfect way to meet\
  \ the locals and truly immerse yourself in the \u201Ccountry\u201D experience. Given\
  \ that, I chose not to coordinate or pre-book transportation services and figured\
  \ worse case scenario I could always book a last minute classic cuban car. Boy was\
  \ I in for a rude awakening! Given Cuba\u2019s egalitarian state and extensive economic\
  \ censorship the public is not incentivized to produce or work which in turn meant\
  \ no means for last minute in country bookings for transportation; thats how we\
  \ met Carlos our cab driver. \n\nCarlos was a former militant and had served in\
  \ Fidel\u2019s military academy and shared the same jesuit value of equality and\
  \ emulated the spirit of the Cuban Revolution. During our trip in Cuba he offered\
  \ to be our country guide in exchange for gas and to listen and tell the story of\
  \ why the spirit of Fidel would live on through the people. He explained how communism\
  \ promoted equality and eliminated competition thereby stripping jealousy or the\
  \ need to steal and instead exchanged it for collectivism and a communal society.\
  \ He explained how all of these ideals were seen and expressed through the countries\
  \ street graffiti in radiant colors and images of people standing strong always\
  \ looking up. \n\nHe showed us murals and highlighted why authors such as hemingway\
  \ found it so easy to write there, because the public was in a constant relaxed\
  \ social state due to their lack of need making it an ideal retreat for tourists\
  \ escaping capitalism. \n\nOverall our trip was different because of Carlos, he\
  \ romanticized and helped us understand the spirit of the Cuban Revolution and why\
  \ Fidel was able to stay in power for so long. It wasn\u2019t because he was authoritarian,\
  \ it was because he never sold out to western capitalism and stayed true to the\
  \ spirit of the Marxist-Leninist vision. He created his Utopian society inspite\
  \ of being embargoed by imperialist trade powers and never compromised his ideals\
  \ for status or titles."
