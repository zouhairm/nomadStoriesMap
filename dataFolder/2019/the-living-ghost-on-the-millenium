Text: "I was in London, walking down the Millenium Bridge. It was a sunny but chilly\
  \ day, without a sign of clouds in the sky, unsual to London. My visit to the Shakespeare\u2019\
  s Globe had gone wrong after I arriving at two o\u2019clock p.m. and finding out\
  \ they only had tours by the morning. Not feeling like heading back to the suburban\
  \ old-stylish house I was staying at, I walked around Southwark by the shore of\
  \ the Tamisa, no destiny ahead.\nBy that time of the trip, I had meet amazing people,\
  \ had breath taking experiences, bought more than I should have. I was walking down\
  \ the Millenium Bridge, only intending to go by the other shore when there is this\
  \ woman selling portraits at the platform. She was tiny, middle-aged, caucasian,\
  \ punished by time. Immigrant if I had to guess. She wear this shabby, old brown\
  \ coat on top of a chess blouse with a purple hat, also stale and threadbare. Her\
  \ eyes were defeated. Her breath was tired. She could be a dead body right in front\
  \ of my eyes. Why was she like that I never know because I never asked.\nI walked\
  \ past by, the way tourist walk: slowly, no worries in mind, just killing in time.\
  \ I observed their paintings and they were good. All landscapes of London; the Big\
  \ Ben, the London Eye, a pub. I walked by, was amused but didn\u2019t stop. A few\
  \ steps later I stopped, turned around and come back to her. She looked at me like\
  \ she didn\u2019t see me. Like I was a dead body too.\n\u201CHi\u201D. She didn\u2019\
  t answer, just keep staring at me. I kneel on the floor to get a better look at\
  \ the images. Finally this one caught my eyes: all painted in gray, except for a\
  \ telephone cabin and an umbrella, painted in red. There was a couple underneath\
  \ the umbrella walking by the Big Ben on a wet paviment. The simple black hand-writing\
  \ on the right corner said \u201CAquanu\u201D.\nI got up and asked her how much.\
  \ She looked at me for a while and said \u201Cfive\u201D. I open my wallet while\
  \ she put the portrait on a silver bag. I gave her a ten pounds note that she guarded\
  \ in a money belt on her waist. That was it. No \u201Cthank you\u201D, no \u201C\
  have a nice day\u201D. Nothing. I nodded my head and moved on.\nThat moment and\
  \ that woman were supposed to be forgotten by the time I got home, lay my head on\
  \ my pillow and felt asleep. But it never did. That woman and her eyes, her lack\
  \ of life, were stucked in my brain. Maybe because I saw myself on her and she saw\
  \ herself in me. Differente backgrounds, different languages, different appearences\
  \ and the same lack of life.\nI never forgot, the living ghost that looked like\
  \ on me on the Millenium Bridge in a sunny London day."
