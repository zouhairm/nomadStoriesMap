Text: "Namaste.. friend ! \n\nA warm and joyful thanks to all readers for joining\
  \ in a journey of time lapse of 700 footsteps which will give you a virtual experience\
  \ of my travel on ground of great Kings, Maharajas, Queens, Forts, Cultures maintained\
  \ on the pillars of bravery , sacrifices and loyalty of soldiers and people known\
  \ as Rajasthan, India.\nI was welcomed with greetings in form of Vermillion blessings\
  \ on my forehead and cultural music of \"Padhaaro maare desh mein !!\" which means\
  \ Welcome to my country. In Chittorgarh fort, I was fantasised with the great and\
  \ strong wall which was even for Khiliji to difficult to penetrate and invade with\
  \ his mortars and tops (tank). High and strong build Vijay Stambh , Johar well where\
  \ all married women of soldiers die by jumping on fire after defeat in war to beautiful\
  \ palace of Rani Padmavati with blossoming garden took me to beautiful, horrific\
  \ and proudly aspect of history.\nNext stop of my journey was Kota , city with educational\
  \ importance and popular for it's varieties of food. Kota has a cross road  which\
  \ is famous for a large and magnificent statue of Maharaja Maharana Pratap Singh\
  \ sitting on his favorite horse, Chetak. Few distances out of city, Garadia Mahadev\
  \ temple is situated on bank of Chambal river with terrific and pleasuring view\
  \ of Mother nature. Infact with day end, I visited all 7 wonders of world without\
  \ Visa.\nThen I took my footsteps towards Udaipur, City of Lakes where my meal was\
  \ Rajasthani thali which make my stomach and my day happy and worthful . Morning\
  \ sightseeing of Lake Pichola , Fateh Sagar lake and Cable car ride to hilltop temple\
  \ gave a fabulous view of city. City Palace museum , gardens in Saheliyon ki Bari,\
  \ boating at Lake Pichola , Under the Sun art museum and Lake front dining were\
  \ few of the \"not missing things \" list in travel plan. Out of city for historical\
  \ and spiritual view, Haldi Ghaati , Maharana Pratap museum , Sahastra Bahu temple\
  \ , Eklingji temple and famous Nathdwara temple were my next spots to enjoy.\nAs\
  \ City Palace of Udaipur is beautiful , Umaid Bhawan palace of Jodhpur is not less\
  \ but more spectacular and masterpiece architecture for selfies. Topview of Blue\
  \ city from Mehrangarh Fort & Shopping from Sardar Market are in my \" Must Do things\"\
  \ list.\nTo enjoy and experience desert life of Rajasthan, I crawled towards \"\
  \ The Golden city, Jaisalmer\". The Golden City Fort , Patwon ki Haveli , Badal\
  \ Mahal and Nathamal ki Haveli were some of the famous tourist spots. Most astonishing\
  \ fact about Patwon ki Haveli was that in 18th or 19th century, Haveli was bought\
  \ by a family of amount which is in today's date of around Rs. 40,000 - Rs. 60,000.\n\
  My journey came to end with doing \" Must Do things\" i.e., Camel Safari in That\
  \ desert, Jaisalmer Sunset point view and Rajasthani Cultural folk dance and music\
  \ program under the starry sky of desert. The last one which was enjoying both music\
  \ and silence under sky with stars showing our past , history and heritage make\
  \ my soul and body free from all lethargy , anxieties , pain , tension and other\
  \ negative factors.\nAt last I want to conclude my travel story by welcoming all\
  \ other travellers and friends to visit India and specially Rajasthan.\n\" Padhaaro\
  \ maare desh mein\""
