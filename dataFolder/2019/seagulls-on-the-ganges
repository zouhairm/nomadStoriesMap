Text: "The night of my husband\u2019s passing, I glanced a brooding seagull on our\
  \ beach house balcony. Hours later, still there, the whispers of my heart questioned\
  \ might it have come to escort my husband home?  Since then, 12 years of solo travelling,\
  \ criss-crossing the globe have made me a braver woman, but at 65 I never imagined\
  \ I would travel to the sacred city, Varanasi, in the heart of the Ganges valley,\
  \ in North India, alone. \n\nOn the city\u2019s outskirts, my driver slowed navigating\
  \ the narrow, bustling, broken streets. Palpable poverty all around me, air putrid,\
  \ horns constantly honking, I broke my gaze from the chaos around me to study a\
  \ photo I carried from home. In the photo, seagulls flew low on the holy Ganga chasing\
  \ after a bajara (classic wooden boats) carrying holy men scattering ashes on the\
  \ river. What did it all mean?\n\nI embarked a bajara on the river and traveled\
  \ 20mins downstream to reach the 18th century BrijRama Palace, where I stayed. Along\
  \ the way, we passed other bajaras, carrying families scattering ashes, and I watched,\
  \ mystified, as hundreds of seagulls followed after them. My photo continued to\
  \ speak loudly to me. One of the oldest cities in the world, Varanasi is the centre\
  \ of faith for Hindus, and a spiritual pilgrimage for millions of world travelers.\
  \ Hindus believe immersing ashes of the deceased in the Mother Ganga cleanses sins\
  \ and paves the way toward Moksha - the freedom from the cycle of life and death.\
  \ \n\nThe restoration of BrijRama Palace, the oldest building in Varanasi, situated\
  \ on the Darbhanga Ghat, took 18 years to complete, bringing a glorious, regal period\
  \ to life once more. Impressive, it was such a contrast to what I had just experienced\
  \ on my journey down Mother Ganga. \n\nFrom the hotel\u2019s terrace, overlooking\
  \ the river for as far as the eye could see, I sipped Chai tea, thinking about a\
  \ faith so strong that it ignored a river full of raw sewage, plastics, discarded\
  \ idols, partially cremated corpses, ashes of the deceased, flower garlands, as\
  \ well as female hip bones and male chest bones that don\u2019t burn during cremation.\
  \ It was a leap of faith for me to come, but the urge to more deeply understand\
  \ the mysteries of the afterlife and explore the idea of seagulls on the Ganga being\
  \ conduits carrying spirits from the river, from one life into their next made me\
  \ look beyond the fact that India was an unknown destination to me.\n \nMy search\
  \ for answers began at the Manikarnika Ghat (the main cremation in Varanasi). Clarity\
  \ on how a Hindu processes the journey from cremation to the river, from one life\
  \ into the next, would hopefully allow me to finally, fully, let my husband go.\
  \ On the way, dodging holy cows, stepping over steaming piles of dung, skirting\
  \ small boys chasing cheap, paper kites, I stopped for a quick photo opportunity\
  \ with the long, grey-haired, orange-robed Sadhu (holy men). Below us, in the river,\
  \ half-naked men bathed and women in colorful saris washed clothes. Varanasi was\
  \ indeed an eclectic cosmos.\n\nAn elderly Indian gentleman stepped forward, guiding\
  \ me out of harms way as a mourner in white robes and shaven head made his way to\
  \ Shiva\u2019s fire to light an armful f grass to carry down to a pile of wood covering\
  \ a body waiting cremation.  Purportedly Shiva\u2019s fire was started some 5000\
  \ years ago and has never been extinguished. \n\n\u201CSorry,\u201D I say.\n\nTelling\
  \ me everything is fine, the welcoming man shared how Hindus travel from all over\
  \ the world to die in Varanasi and have their ashes scattered on the Ganga. He pointed\
  \ to a body on a stretcher being carried to a new fire site, telling me, \u201C\
  The bodies are massaged with scented oils, wrapped in colored silks, then covered\
  \ with garlands of flowers in preparation for a dipping in the Ganges before cremation.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI would learn how the ashes are thrown over a left shoulder, into the river,\
  \ and the family never look back, setting both the spirit and them free.\n\nLeaving\
  \ Varanasi, thinking of my husband, I threw a handful of birdseed over my left shoulder,\
  \ and I never looked back."
