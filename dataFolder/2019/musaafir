Text: "The journey begin with late night discussion in a whatsapp group of college\
  \ friends and instantly we came up with the idea for going for a trip. The place\
  \ was decided just in a short moment ,Which was the visit to karnataka as we all\
  \ friends were boys who agreed for this plan we decided to go via Road. On 6th of\
  \ May that is just after 2 days when our plan was confirmed all of my 4 friends\
  \ were ready with their bikes all set for the journey. We started our journey early\
  \ morning around 5 o'clock . As we were ridding our bikes it was a feeling like\
  \ being free from all the sort of Strees in the world. The journey was of 1050km\
  \ long and instantly we planed for Goa. We all decided to have hault in Goa for\
  \ 2 days. As we were ridding we met some lovely people in dhabas in highways with\
  \ such great food and their hospitality around 3 o'clock we were in Goa .we checked\
  \ in a lodge in Panjim and luckily it had a pool on the first day we went around\
  \ some places which had lovely Goan cusien and culture we drank , ate ,danced and\
  \ had a clubbing night well were each of us were trying to hit some girls \U0001F602\
  \ but all ended up having our own company hahahahha after that night we decided\
  \ to do some water sports in the baga beach that was a freaking feeling.\n     \
  \  After that me and my friends gathered our selfs and got ready for the futhur\
  \ journey to karnataka. We left to karnataka around 6 in the morning and we travelled\
  \ through the highway on our bikes witj the speed almost touching to 120+ km/hr\
  \ we again had a hault for couple of mintues for regaing ourself and had a snack\
  \ break after which we continued with our bike rides. Around 2 or 3 o'clock in the\
  \ afternoon we reached our destination we checked in  to a local lodge in Udupi\
  \ we went to some temples around manglore and the famous temple in dharmastala.\
  \ After spending 2 days in Udupi and manglore around some holy places we went to\
  \ the beaches which were mostly croweded. As we were returning back to Mumbai we\
  \ decided to visit Hubli which had some ancient and historical places such as humpi\
  \ . As we were coming back to Mumabi we all saw an wedding in Karnataka border place\
  \ we all went in there as an guest without knowing anyone and had our dinner there\
  \ and went on for the search a lodge the strets were so dark without any stret light\
  \ me and my friends got so worried that we started to play bhajans on phones and\
  \ around 12 in the night we found a lodge we were so tired that we jst went for\
  \ a sleep . Early morning we started early as we usually do we all got done with\
  \ our breakfast and continued with our journey around 7 in the night we reached\
  \ Mumbai and we all were like this trip will be remembered for lifetime. And we\
  \ decided to plan a trip like this once again and named our whatsapp group as southern\
  \ souls.........."
