Text: "Last May, it was the first time for me to travel abroad, I went to Paris to\
  \ attend a conference in the UNESCO headquarters, it was a dream for me to travel\
  \ abroad and I didn't expect that the first country where I will travel; will be\
  \ France. when I arrived there, I didn't believe myself that I am REALLY in Paris;\
  \ it took me a full day to realize that I am really there. My first day was a tour\
  \ in the City of Light, I visited Eiffel tower, Champ-Elise, Louvre Museum and Arc\
  \ De Triumph, when I went back to me hotel, I fall asleep, and when I woke up in\
  \ the second day, I didn\u2019t believe myself that I am still in France, I thought\
  \ that it was just a dream for me. I stayed there five days, attended the conference\
  \ for three days and spent the other two days traveling and walking through the\
  \ streets in the City of Light, on my last day there, I went on a tour to say good\
  \ bye to Paris, I woke up, got dressed, took my breakfast and went to Notre dame\
  \ and Eiffel tower for the last time. I stood there in front of the tower and imagined\
  \ myself returning back home and viewing it from Google Earth application on my\
  \ iPad, then I realized that the time has come to return home. During my visit there,\
  \ I participated in educational trips to various places, from which I learned the\
  \ traditional costumes of people around the world, I found a lot of commonalities\
  \ especially in the pure human feelings and beliefs and I saw the reflection of\
  \ different cultures and local themes of countries in the whole world."
