Text: "People often say that life without expectations is full of pleasant surprises.\n\
  \nIt was a time when I was at a very important stage in my life - I had to decide\
  \ my future career. But the constant planning became overwhelming. I knew a spontaneous\
  \ adventure would clear my mind.\n\nThe following weekend I and my mother jumped\
  \ in our tiny car and left the city of Kaunas before sunrise. We made a deal not\
  \ to plan anything ahead and let the road surprise us. \n\nOur journey began at\
  \ the crossroad where two great Lithuanian rivers meet. We decided to continue alongside\
  \ the river Nemunas, following the scenic Panemune route. On the way, we explored\
  \ the historic mounds of Veliuona and Seredzius, where breathtaking views of the\
  \ river basin let our imagination run wild. These hillforts are unique to the pagan\
  \ Baltic culture.\n\nIt made a lasting impression as we discovered ancient castles\
  \ and churches, that endured centuries of Teutonic attacks to tell the stories of\
  \ grand dukes and kings of Lithuania.\n\nDriving further towards the West, the landscapes\
  \ were exhaling the air of serenity. From dense forests to mossy marshlands, our\
  \ Lithuanian road trip whispered us promises of unforgettable memories.\n\nAs the\
  \ sky changed from light blue to hazy purple, I felt tranquil at last. \n\nHowever,\
  \ the sunset was a reminder that we still had to find a bed for the night. It was\
  \ getting alarmingly late and the nearest town was more than two hours away! We\
  \ set out to find ourselves a remote campsite, so we turned on the next side road,\
  \ towards the ruins of Pakuta church.\n\nDriving our car deeper into the dark woods\
  \ we were finally greeted by a silhouette of a tower. To our surprise, what seemed\
  \ to be an entire village appeared in front of our eyes. We passed by a small wooden\
  \ amphitheater followed by stables and houses.\n\nFurther down the road, we came\
  \ across an old graveyard and finally, the Pakuta church. However, it appeared far\
  \ from ruined or abandoned. \nAn uneasy feeling ran through me, but curiosity and\
  \ thirst for adventure kept us going further. We stopped the car, got out and slowly\
  \ approached an old rusty gate. A faint song could be heard from inside. Was this\
  \ all an illusion, a hallucination after driving the whole day? Abruptly,  just\
  \ like it started, the mysterious song stopped. The church grew completely quiet.\
  \ The heavy gates creaked and opened slowly. We saw a small group of people. They\
  \ quietly left, seemingly unaware of our presence.\n\nLuckily, my mother stepped\
  \ forward and took the chance to say hello. The salute turned into a passionate\
  \ and vivid conversation with the locals.\nWe learned that the church had been fully\
  \ restored by people recovering from addiction. They had also built the whole surrounding\
  \ village. Nowadays here summers are filled with camps, concerts, and religious\
  \ activities. A secret sanctuary built and nurtured in the middle of nowhere.\n\n\
  As the dark night was approaching, villagers kindly offered us to stay in their\
  \ homes. Our journey was indeed full of blessings and surprises! \n\nThe next morning\
  \ we were greeted by local monks, who rarely left their solitary houses. We were\
  \ invited to join them for breakfast. \n\nOur conversations at the table opened\
  \ a door to a completely new and unseen world of the monks and revealed the wisdom\
  \ and passion for life that flourished in the small town of Pakuta.\nHowever, the\
  \ celebrity of our interaction turned out to be a melon that we brought from the\
  \ city. The monks had never seen anything like it before! The breakfast was filled\
  \ with awe, laughter, and most importantly - gratitude. \n\nWe were accepted in\
  \ the local community as old friends, even though we were complete strangers. This\
  \ genuine human interaction in the middle of the Lithuanian forest had brought so\
  \ much happiness and hope. We never expected to find grace in such a wilderness.\
  \ Kindness is all around us - it can be found even in the most remote of forests!\
  \ We were proven again that life without expectations is full of pleasant surprises.\n\
  \nThe memory of it still inspires me to keep traveling and discovering new kind\
  \ worlds."
