Text: "The final bell rang and I headed out into the crowded hallway still chatting\
  \ with my best friend Stephanie, both coming to a sudden stop as we saw my mother\
  \ scanning the faces of passing students in clear search of... me? Us? What unusual\
  \ event might have happened for her to appear here at school? We paused at my locker\
  \ and as she walked towards us I tried reading her body language for a clue, anything...\
  \ from her huge smile I knew it must be good, and there! That! There was an envelope\
  \ in her hand. The butterflies in my stomach threatened to carry me away as I opened\
  \ it, clueless as to how this one decision made by strangers would change the course\
  \ of my entire life. YES, I was accepted as an exchange student! I had to be reminded\
  \ to keep reading to find where I would be living for the next year. \"Paraguay!\"\
  \ I yelled excitedly. \"I'm going to Paraguay! Where's that?\"\n\nRacing home, I\
  \ checked the map and poured over my notes in search of clues as to WHY I had written\
  \ down Paraguay as one of my choices. Yes, they speak Spanish, ok. Ahhh, there it\
  \ was. The city the exchange was offered in is located on the border of Brazil and\
  \ Argentina, providing a very good likelihood to visit not one, not two, but three\
  \ countries while living there. That had definitely been the selling point to a\
  \ girl who had never been on a plane before, let alone out of the country. So after\
  \ Spain and France, little-known Paraguay had been written down as a third choice.\
  \ Apparently those European spots are quite sought after, and so there I was, 17\
  \ and on a plane to the unknown in a time before technology made communication home\
  \ quite as simple as it is now. As I traveled through the clouds it was impossible\
  \ to imagine what the future would hold: the 9/11 attacks the day after the city\
  \ was shut down due to protests over inter-country bridge repairs, racing through\
  \ partitioned streets to be reunited with the other American exchange student and\
  \ anxiously attempting to contact home. Walking to the gym in the Arab section of\
  \ town in the weeks after, and realizing just how obviously American I was in a\
  \ town suspected of helping fund the attacks. Participating in the cultural tradition\
  \ of a \"debut\" to society. My first kiss. The realization that cultural differences\
  \ are less important than family lifestyle and despite my easy-going ways, that\
  \ did not ensure a good fit in any family. Cute little lizards and terer\xE9, a\
  \ \"new\" family that felt like home, new friends I couldn't imagine leaving and\
  \ oh, so many, many changes.\n\nOn that plane ride I could not imagine that it would\
  \ only be the beginning. That I would return to the U.S. feeling like a stranger,\
  \ anxious to go \"home\" to Paraguay.  That years later I would return to live and\
  \ work and form a life there, marrying a \"paraguayo\" and delivering our first\
  \ child there. That the very name of one of my children would come from the native\
  \ Guarani language- Amar\xFA, father of the rain. \n\nI am often asked how I can\
  \ bare to leave my children home and travel. \"Your son is so young! I could never\
  \ do that, I would miss my kids too much.\" The judgment implied is harsh: they\
  \ love their kids more. I sigh at the presumption. Kindred spirits will understand\
  \ that travel is a necessity. Without such trips I would suffocate and drown just\
  \ as surely as if I were tossed into the water chained. It is a part of me. I need\
  \ it to breathe, grow, LIVE. It is a defining characteristic that has formed my\
  \ life in a myriad of ways. \n\nNo, sitting on the plane, staring out the window\
  \ at 17 years of age, I could never have imagined.\n\nHolding that letter... Para-where?"
