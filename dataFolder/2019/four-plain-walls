Text: "When I was 17 years old, I was selected to represent a youth programme I was\
  \ involved with at an international conference for development through sport in\
  \ Zambia. \n\nThere were many new experiences I had on that trip that I could relate.\
  \ My first time seeing a waterfall (somewhat up close), which is especially memorable\
  \ as I am terrified of heights. My first international conference, where my opinions\
  \ and contributions mattered as much as the adults attending. My first time crossing\
  \ that spectacular line where night meets day in an airplane thousands of miles\
  \ high. My first time having a plane\u2019s landing gear malfunction and circling\
  \ the airport for an hour hoping the fuel didn\u2019t run out before we could safely\
  \ land. Eeeek.\n\nBut I remember most was my visit to a local village. I wish I\
  \ could say I remember the name but I can promise you that there are many a face\
  \ imprinted on my memory that I will never forget. As I exited the bus that ferried\
  \ is to the village, I noticed what we would call a \u2018benab\u2019 back home\
  \ in Guyana. Four walls and a thatched roof of palm leaves. It may have been a wooden\
  \ roof, to be honest, but I can\u2019t recall. There was no glad in the windows\
  \ and no furniture inside. \n\nTo the left of the building, a few hundred feet away,\
  \ I noticed some lines drawn in the sand. It appeared to be a large rectangle. One\
  \ of the locals with us explained that the building was their new school and the\
  \ children near by excitedly related something to him. His face broke into a big\
  \ smile as he told us that they had told him how excited they were to have a building\
  \ to learn in. These children were excited to have a school. I spent a lot of my\
  \ high school years trying to find ways to avoid sitting in a class and to these\
  \ children it was the best part of their day. I had never before thought about what\
  \ a privilege it was to be able to go to a school where I could sit in a chair and\
  \ learn new information. I agonised over how restrictive my school uniform was and\
  \ why time seemed to pass so slowly between the hours of 8 and 5, Monday to Friday.\
  \ \n\nAfter doing our presentations/demonstrating how our programmes worked by running\
  \ various activities with the children, they led us over to the big rectangle I\
  \ noticed earlier. Suddenly, two poles were erected on either end, in the middles\
  \ of what I realised were baselines. The poles had no backboard but each had a bucket.\
  \ Looking to the centre of the rectangle, I saw a circle and noticed that the \u2018\
  court\u2019 had been divided into thirds. It was a netball court. With basically\
  \ no actual equipment besides an old netball, we played one of the most spirited\
  \ and excellently umpired games of netball I have ever enjoyed in my life. \n\n\
  I\u2019d like to say that I kept this in mind and moved through life with more of\
  \ a sense of gratitude than before. Alas, I am not that good a person. But I do\
  \ recall it from time to time and I remember that you can find immense joy in little\
  \ things and it is a comfort when I am struggling to find happiness in my life today."
