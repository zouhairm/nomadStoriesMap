Text: 'The stroy is about to our life''s and become interacting travel people with
  travel. What does we feel in travel tour and what people think in their own ways
  of travel. The safar is indian word it means travel.so what we suffer in travel
  and what others story to make us story. The most considerable thing is my story
  is lots of combination of other people suffer in their own life. Because travel
  is only way to become all flash back of our life. All incident of the safar (travel)
  is briefly about our own life because life is a travel everyone safar in the life.
  Just one word safar (indian word means "travel) is always stuck in every one''s
  life. The local peoples story and combination of our thinking made a new story of
  travel. Suppose they all are very trustful because we met him for short time, so  we
  can make a story of "safar (indian word means "travel) in sufer". And even they
  tell us lie so a new story is always beginning . So that is a criteria of my story
  of "safar in suffer".


  Respecly sir my thinking is childish but a childish thinking is made best of the
  story. So please think about my story.'
