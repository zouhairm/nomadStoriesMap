Text: "I am a backup! \n\nRacing mountain bikes down hills is crazy stuff.  I spend\
  \ all day driving up and down narrow twisty roads - while Jake, my grandson blasts\
  \ his way, in a matter of minutes, down steep mountainsides - at break-neck speed\
  \ - waiting for his backup to take him back to the top. I am used to wacky stuff\
  \ where my grandchildren are concerned but as a backup, I\u2019m the person who\
  \ deserves the medal! \n\nNow, I am a tourist in Canada, no backup for me today.\
  \ Jake, my obsessed mountain biker grandson, is showing me the sights of Squarmish\
  \ in an old beat-up van his boss has loaned him for the weekend. Guess what? His\
  \ boss owns a Bike Shop!\n\nSquamish is 30 miles inland from Vancouver. It\u2019\
  s a small unexceptional town but has the distinction of being a Canadian centre\
  \ for a number of extreme sports \n\nThe scenery declares the spot to be a world\
  \ ranking mountain biker's paradise. I am glad I am not a backup in Canada. The\
  \ mountains are twice as rugged and high as compared to those in New Zealand!\n\n\
  However, Kitesurfing needs no backup. We stand mesmerized watching them speed across\
  \ the bay. Many are enjoying the sport but few can manage the return run. Most tumble\
  \ and fall into the sea. One guy is exceptional. He manipulates and manoeuvres his\
  \ balance and sail so cleverly as he gracefully turns and speeds back across the\
  \ top of the water at an incredible speed.\n\nI prefer terra firma so Jake and I\
  \ climb to the top of the South Peak of Stawamus Chief, a hill of rock culminating\
  \ into a wide expanse of smooth shiny rock at a height of 500 meters. The rugged\
  \ track has either rock or built-up wooden steps almost all the way. Breath catching\
  \ encouragement plateaus are almost nonexistent. The climax is the last few meters\
  \ where, with the aid of a rope, we clamber up a vertical rock surface to the top\
  \ of the Chief.\n\nThe view over the bay and town? Worth every breath-catching step\
  \ of the way.\n\nLater, with Jake at work, I decide on a leisurely wander along\
  \ the riverside. My morning adventure has completely depleted my day\u2019s energy\
  \ supply.\n\nI come to a sign pointing to a bush track, \u201CBurgers and Fries.\u201D\
  \  Only a ten-minute walk, the sign proclaimed. Perhaps a \u201CSubway?\u201D Ah\
  \ yes, a big fat burger is just what I need.\n\nI follow the track, muttering under\
  \ my breath, \u2018please God, no more hills today!\u2019\n\nOn the way, I meet\
  \ a couple who look as if they have come from an outer planet. Carrying ropes with\
  \ jingling metal clips dangling from a waist harness they look quite impressive.\n\
  \n\u201CHow far to reach the burgers\u201D?\n\nThey look at me oddly.\n\n\u201C\
  Five minutes and you will be there,\u201D the guy said, his face beaming a grin\
  \ from ear to ear.  \n\nHe looked so happy. They must be good burgers I am thinking\
  \ as I walk on.\n \nThen I hear voices and come to a clearing with high rock cliffs.\
  \ The flat shiny wall is alive with rock climbers, most anchored to a person on\
  \ the ground. Now that is the kind of backup I would like to be.\n\nI watch. Marvelling\
  \ at their fitness and expertise \n\nThey offer me a try. They are all decades younger\
  \ than I. Alas, with their safety equipment and instructions I make it no further\
  \ than a few feet - but it is fun.\n\nHowever, I need sustenance. My adventures\
  \ of the day have depleted my inner resources.\n\nI ask, \u201Chow far to the burger\
  \ and fries?\u201D \n\nMy new friends burst out laughing.\n \nIt seems, many years\
  \ ago, someone had a warped sense of humour. \n\nAs for me? I can see no connection\
  \ or the faintest likeness of those cliffs to a burger and fries.\n\nI certainly\
  \ didn\u2019t expect, and yes I\u2019m rather disappointed, to find my burger and\
  \ fries is a rock cliff!"
