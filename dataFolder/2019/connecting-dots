Text: "\u201CThere\u2019s a time and a place for everything\u201D... I said to myself\
  \ for more than 4 years, expecting to find the must unrealistic life changing experience.\
  \ Of course this sounded ridiculous in my head, almost imposible, till I went to\
  \ Croatia.  \nI\u2019ve always wondered what would it be to make that journey of\
  \ finding yourself, well... being there made me realized there is in fact a time\
  \ and a place for everything... and it\u2019s funny how sometimes you need to be\
  \ far from home to feel really at home... tricky right? Well... also amazing. I\
  \ started connecting all the dots... all the things I needed to clear in my head,\
  \ in my life. In a place full of history, islands, magical sunsets, I found myself\
  \ truly and deeply. There are no words to describe the beauty of the journey, in\
  \ the most realistic and non superficial way, the journey where I started to love\
  \ myself, to love life, God, everything around me, even the negative things. Sounds\
  \ ironic but traveling often does that to people, at least that\u2019s what I\u2019\
  ve heard... I\u2019m a Mexican girl who has a dream, a dream of changing the world,\
  \ the rules, the bad for the good... and sometimes, if we\u2019re lucky, we can\
  \ change people, circumstances, mistakes... but the most important change is when\
  \ you change yourself, for good, for better, when you grow and become the person\
  \ you\u2019ve said you\u2019ll be, the person you have admire you\u2019re whole\
  \ life... that\u2019s what Croatia left me, being there, meeting wonderful people,\
  \ doing a lot of introspection made me realized that maybe you\u2019re not so far\
  \ from home, maybe where you\u2019re looking is just a superficial space in the\
  \ universe, where your true journey begins when you find yourself, inside your heart,\
  \ your mind. \n\nHave a wonderful day!"
