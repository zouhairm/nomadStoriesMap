Text: "My driver dropped me off and pointed down towards a long, dirt road. He proceeded\
  \ by giving me the universal \u201Cshh\" gesture, without actually making the sound.\
  \ My intuition was telling me that he was not only insinuating to be silent, but\
  \ inconspicuous as well. I nodded, wrapping up the nonverbal agreement between myself\
  \ and a middle aged Thai man. As he drove off, I knew I wasn\u2019t supposed to\
  \ be here. I knew it was deemed a horrible place to be, especially for a person\
  \ like myself who recently gained the knowledge that I did. I was here for a simple\
  \ reason but knew it was going to be far from a simple effort. I had to retrieve\
  \ cash from an atm machine, considering the one back at my accommodation was out\
  \ of order and this was the only one for miles.\n\nI stood at the base of the road,\
  \ in absolute fear. It wasn\u2019t fear of being physically harmed in anyway, but\
  \ fear of being mentally harmed. It\u2019s similar to seeing something that cannot\
  \ be unseen, igniting a heinous emotion within you, causing pain to live in your\
  \ heart forever. I soberly knew just what I was getting myself into, and then began\
  \ to wonder if I actually needed to go through with this, but I did. I had a bus\
  \ to catch to Bangkok and without cash, I wouldn\u2019t make it home. So on I went,\
  \ like a shield ready in defense. \n\nAs I made my way on foot, I felt my senses\
  \ become heightened. Time slowed down, and everything became more conscious, as\
  \ if I was supposed to savor this awful experience. After what felt like ages, I\
  \ made it to the end of the road. Right in my sight was a baby elephant. He had\
  \ to of been no more than a year old, vulnerable as ever. I could see that the elephant\
  \ was swinging his trunk back and forth. To the naked eye, one would think that\
  \ the baby was conveying happiness, but I undoubtedly knew that he was far from\
  \ a happy place. He was experiencing pure terror, for what he endured in his past\
  \ and what was to come in his future. The elephant had his spirit taken away, enough\
  \ to cause him harm yet a small amount left behind as a reminder of what\u2019s\
  \ been harshly robbed of him. And I knew for certain exactly how his spirit was\
  \ taken, every gruesome detail of it. \n\nDuring my time in Thailand, I learned\
  \ about the cruelty that elephants face in Southeast Asia. There is a tradition\
  \ called \u201CPhajaan\u201D where young elephants are rendered submissive to their\
  \ handlers through a well thought out process. The elephants are tied up, caged,\
  \ and brutally beaten, as their spirits slowly deteriorate over the course of weeks.\
  \ The elephants are then left lonely and confused until their \u201Csaviors\u201D\
  \ arrive to \u201Crelease\u201D them, manipulating a bond between the two. It is\
  \ then that the handlers achieve full control. \n\nMy senses still intensified,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t turn my sight away from the baby elephant. I could hear a large\
  \ crowd cheering in the far background, and a microphone with a man on the other\
  \ side of it as if he was providing entertainment; entertainment for the ignorant.\
  \ I could smell sweet treats being sold for profit to patrons with smiles on their\
  \ faces, not a clue of the reality. It was far worse than I imagined. It was a circus.\
  \ \n\nThis experience created a heightened sense of awareness for me in a place\
  \ that completely lacked just that, awareness. A place that continued to rob the\
  \ spirit of these animals without having the awareness of what a spirit actually\
  \ is, and what weight a spirit can hold. \n\nAs I was walked back down the road,\
  \ without the cash I came for, I was in tears. I found myself wondering why my senses\
  \ were so sharpened back there, forcing me to gain this vivid perception that I\
  \ will never forget. It was in my broken down spirit that I realized that it was\
  \ all for the little spirit left in that baby elephant. Awareness is powerful and\
  \ needs to be spread."
