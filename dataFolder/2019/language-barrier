Text: "Languages had always been a part of my life. I loved words and stories from\
  \ a young age, which, once I entered school, led to a natural passion for accumulating\
  \ foreign languages. First Japanese, then Spanish, both of which I took to like\
  \ a duck to water. However, for many years, I never imagined that I would ever step\
  \ foot in a foreign country. \n\nSo when the chance came for me to finally travel\
  \ to Japan, one of my immediate thoughts was one of panic. I had given up Japanese\
  \ the year before and my skill with the language had deteriorated quite a bit since\
  \ then. How on earth would I survive in a country that spoke only that language?\
  \  \n\nUpon arrival, my fears were not alleviated. Everywhere I looked, everything\
  \ I heard was in Japanese. Barely any English existed there, in my opinion. \n\n\
  In spite of this and just as I thought, I absolutely loved Japan. The dimly-lit\
  \ cobblestone streets of Kyoto which wound between wooden buildings, some sharing\
  \ walls as seamlessly as if the newer buildings next to them had been there for\
  \ centuries. The bustling cities of Tokyo and Osaka, filled with people, brightly-lit\
  \ neon and delicious aromas arising from hundreds of restaurants and food vendors.\
  \ The quiet trains with their unspoken etiquette, strictly observed by all passengers.\n\
  \nEverything was wonderful and I loved it all. \n\nNavigation around Japan was a\
  \ new experience, but less panic-stricken than I had imagined. It helped that the\
  \ Japanese people were some of the friendliest I had ever met, because I was constantly\
  \ asking them for directions. I didn\u2019t think I remembered any Japanese at all,\
  \ but I found myself using one phrase a lot: \u201CWhere does this train go?\u201D\
  \ One man even jumped off his train to check the screen and ensure it was the right\
  \ one for me! \n\nOn the way to visit the Arashiyama Bamboo Grove, I became worried\
  \ that I had accidentally taken the wrong train, despite my constant vigilance.\
  \ Leaning over to a Japanese man in the seat next to me, I asked him in Japanese\
  \ whether this train went to Arashiyama or not. To my surprise and mortification,\
  \ he answered, in a bemused voice, \u201CSorry, I don\u2019t speak Japanese.\u201D\
  \ \n\nHis accent jarred with his appearance, shocking me. After apologising profusely\
  \ for my mistake, I discovered two things: one, that he and his friend were actually\
  \ American and two, that this was the train to Arashiyama. I settled back into my\
  \ seat, determined to not speak to anyone ever again, when I found myself listening\
  \ in on their conversation. I realised it was in Spanish and, within seconds, had\
  \ joined in. \n\nLater on at my hotel, exhausted from my action-packed day, I shared\
  \ an elevator ride with another Caucasian woman also staying there. Halfway up,\
  \ I noticed that she was carrying a Woolworths bag. Becoming excited at the prospect\
  \ of another person who spoke English, I asked her if she was from Australia. She\
  \ said, very casually, that she had just been to Sydney, hence the Woolworths bag,\
  \ but she was actually Argentinian. I immediately switched to Spanish and we spent\
  \ the remainder of the elevator ride in conversation, discussing her overseas travels\
  \ and my experiences in Japan so far. \n\nI began my holiday fearful of the language\
  \ barrier I would face. In actual fact, the only reason for my fear was the assumption\
  \ I, someone who had never travelled overseas before, had made. I had assumed that\
  \ everyone in Japan would speak Japanese, despite knowing that there were many people\
  \ in Australia who didn\u2019t speak English. And yet, this was not unexpected.\
  \ It was learning that there were people in Japan who spoke Spanish that truly stunned\
  \ me. \n\nMultilingualism isn\u2019t just an idea to me anymore. It\u2019s a reality,\
  \ one I am eager to experience again."
