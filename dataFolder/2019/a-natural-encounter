Text: "The Zambezi is unusually crowded for early November. The rains are late and\
  \ the river is one of two accessible watering holes at Mana Pools. The third has\
  \ been completely taken over by large numbers of crocodiles who chose the shades\
  \ of a hidden dam over the open expanse of the river which winds through six Southern\
  \ African countries. Though this would make one more confident to canoe along the\
  \ banks of this nortoriously unpredictable body of water, the resident hippos remind\
  \ my partner, the guide and myself that the crocodiles are not the only danger.\
  \ We are unwelcome guests and must respect the waterways as we begin the journey\
  \ upstream. \n\nIt\u2019s a gentle ride, with barely any wind to steer us off path\
  \ or provide a break from the sweltering heat. Thomas, our young guide and captain\
  \ on this journey, is a pleasant fellow with a confident disposition and plenty\
  \ of stories of the rivers from his childhood. We are completely enchanted as we\
  \ enjoy an undisrupted view of the river ahead. Well, almost undisrupted as I am\
  \ sitting in the middle with my partner at head and Thomas behind us, passionately\
  \ navigating his most experienced canoe through the deeper pockets of the Zambezi,\
  \ which are close enough to the ridge for us to swim to safety yet far enough not\
  \ to accidentally capsize us.\n\nIt\u2019s been an hour of enjoyable conversations,\
  \ witnessing the precarious crossing of a rather unbothered female elephant from\
  \ Zimbabwe to Zambia, and rare engagement with some buffaloes who are quick to turn\
  \ their backs in annoyance. The residents of Mana Pools, wild as they are, have\
  \ approved the occasional company of human visitors in their natural home. So the\
  \ week we have spent camping by the River provides an unmatched engagement with\
  \ African nature. \n\nBy now we have found the perfect rhythm to appease our hippo\
  \ hosts: a bang or two on the canoe, use the oar so you know where to go. The vibrations\
  \ \u2018encourage\u2019 the resting hippos close by to come up from under the water\
  \ so we can cautiously avoid disturbing their rest and go around the safer way.\
  \ We are all very relaxed and ready to enjoy a slow ride downstream back to camp,\
  \ sun at our backs. Without warning, a slight loss of rhythm and dilussions of a\
  \ non eventful afternoon lands us on the back of a completely agitated fully grown\
  \ hippo. Three meters long and averaging about one meter in height, the only way\
  \ to go from impact is up; hippo, canoe and crew. After a brief but high elevation,\
  \ gravity kicks in and the canoe with all its passengers still on board lands hard\
  \ on the river. The hippo is relentless and as soon as it recognizes our relief\
  \ (in my case shock), it opens its jaws so wide I can clearly see how deep it\u2019\
  s throat goes, the density of its toothless gums and because of the adreline rushing\
  \ through me, I can estimate that without any effort this hippo will easily break\
  \ our canoe in half. Before there is time to formulate a single survival scenario,\
  \ Thomas drops his oars and reaches for the AK47 which I had forgotten was resting\
  \ with its barrel end pointed towards me but now finds itself pointed directly into\
  \ the hippo\u2019s mouth, cocked. Two things are racing through my mind as I stare\
  \ at Thomas\u2019 back and directly at the hippo: I have never been this close to\
  \ a cocked gun or an angry hippo in my life and I can\u2019t decide which is more\
  \ frightening. I don\u2019t want to die, I don\u2019t want the hippo to die and\
  \ I definitely don\u2019t want the group of kids who are staring at us in astonishment\
  \ from the safety of the shore, helpless, to witness this animals death. At that\
  \ thought, the hippo reasons and retreats, slowly closing its mouth and submerging\
  \ itself to live another day. Thomas puts the safety on, picks up the oars, smiles\
  \ at our bravery and begins our second hour journey downstream. We excitedly recall\
  \ the beautiful experience we have lived on the river Zambezi as we continue passing\
  \ the bemused friends of our hippo."
