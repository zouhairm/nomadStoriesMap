Text: "Couchsurfing. What did I use to say about why I do it? To meet locals, to discover\
  \ places from an intimate point of view and to learn how native people do things.\
  \ To do activities that are not listed on guide books or blogs, because they have\
  \ been passed on only through a generational word of mouth.\nWell, that is very\
  \ romantic and praiseworthy, but it\u2019s not the truth.\nI did it because I was\
  \ a sort of unemployed student on a sabbatical year (if that exists) and, to be\
  \ honest, my budget was very tight.\nCouchsurfing sounded like the solution I was\
  \ desperately looking for: a cheap way to visit the United States. My road trip\
  \ was going to be a month long, and my expense list was already long enough: removing\
  \ the accommodation from my costs was a big step ahead.\nThe Big Bend National Park\
  \ was one of the stops of my itinerary, and Terlingua (Texas) looked like the closest\
  \ town I could use as a base camp for my hiking plans.\nIt was my first experience\
  \ on Couchsurfing.com and while I could see tons of hosts for big cities like Houston\
  \ or Austin, there were not many options for this little village.\nEd, a 75-year-old\
  \ eclectic Texan, was the only host available. According to his bio, he lived his\
  \ life as a tour guide through Europe and the USA and decided to spend his last\
  \ couple of decades in Terlingua, as a happy (and hippie) retired man.\nI didn\u2019\
  t know Terlingua was a hippie community, but as soon as I saw Ed\u2019s pictures\
  \ on his Couchsurfing profile I had a sense this experience was going to require\
  \ a very open mindset, but since I had so much to organize for my trip, I decided\
  \ not to care too much about Ed until I actually got there.\nThe weeks went by,\
  \ and so the day had come. \nI messaged Ed when I was a couple of hours away and\
  \ all he had to say was \u201CThe house is always open. Drop your stuff and meet\
  \ me at the porch downtown. Beers in the fridge\u201D.\nHearing that my bags were\
  \ going to stay in a house which never gets locked was the confirmation of my feelings:\
  \ this character was an absolute joke. But don\u2019t get me wrong, he was an absolutely\
  \ great joke!\nHis house was full of knick-knacks and trinkets. There were posters\
  \ from the 60s and 70s on every wall, pictures and psychedelic art, stuffed toys\
  \ and dreamcatchers coming down from various corners of the ceiling. It looked like\
  \ someone unlocked The Sims cheats and started furnishing and decorating this house\
  \ in the weirdest possible way. Oh boy I had never been in such a fairy-tale place.\
  \ It was shockingly marvellous.\nThe outside, which can be simply described as \u2018\
  dusty\u2019, was decorated as well. Ed\u2019s favourite hobby was collecting stones\
  \ to create pyramidal figures. I\u2019d say the result was a bit less amazing than\
  \ the interior and a bit creepier, but hey, it contributed to the whole astounding\
  \ atmosphere.\nEd couldn\u2019t be any different from his dwell. There he was, proudly\
  \ standing on the porch - the only porch in this ghost town - waving at me with\
  \ a beer in his hand, a \u201CSunday Fun-Day\u201D t-shirt and colored toenails.\
  \ How do I know? He was barefoot, as he would have been for the following 48 hours\
  \ and, as he said, like every other day of the year. \nI had never met anyone like\
  \ Ed, especially not that age. He was sunny, cheerful and playful all the time.\
  \ He didn\u2019t even let me pay for dinner and he gave me a lot of tips for my\
  \ hike. His white mane stood out among all the peasants, but his smile and warm\
  \ heart is what I\u2019ll treasure forever.\nHe was hosting people for free because\
  \ he loved human beings and he wanted to feel less lonely. I was getting hosted\
  \ for free because I was broke. But that was until there. Suddenly I could see what\
  \ was really behind this service: I made a local connection, and I left with a new\
  \ old friend for life."
