Text: "I ran away to New Zealand for love. I met him in a Canadian kitchen last summer,\
  \ we were working together at a rafting resort, and we were both in other relationships\
  \ destined to fail. He had plans to return to New Zealand to work at an upscale\
  \ resort as a chef and I couldn\u2019t resist putting plans in place to follow him.\
  \ When our separate relationships failed, as I knew they would, we began a spiralling\
  \ romance without knowing where it would lead. It took us to Cuba at first, and\
  \ then New Zealand. \nEveryone I knew told me I was crazy to leave my life behind\
  \ for New Zealand, but I ignored their warnings and hopped on a plane. After 21\
  \ hours of flying from Canada to Queenstown, I wasn\u2019t sure what to expect when\
  \ I landed. I was doubtful about my perspective because I hadn\u2019t seen him in\
  \ 60 days and phone conversations are never the same as they are in the flesh. \n\
  I had been with him for just six months and I had hoped the depression lingering\
  \ in my mind would go away during the trip. I had suffered 12 years in a verbally\
  \ and emotionally abusive relationship and it had been just as long since I had\
  \ been in a relationship with someone other than my ex-partner. I wasn\u2019t sure\
  \ how I was supposed to act, or how I was supposed to feel and it was different\
  \ to be with someone new. \nWhen I landed in the tiny airport, I got off the plane\
  \ filled with anxiety, trepidation and nervous anticipation. I had been waiting\
  \ for this moment for so long and I just wanted to run back to the plane and not\
  \ face him. \nHe was standing in the airport waiting for me with a big smile on\
  \ his face and as he pulled me in for a hug and a kiss, the first one we had for\
  \ two months of separation, I felt a feeling I was at home again with him. I couldn\u2019\
  t stop myself from touching him to make sure he was real. The first night we spent\
  \ together was magical and breathless, a night filled with love and fulfilled expectations.\
  \ I will never forget it. \nAfter that, he pulled me into his whirlwind, dramatic\
  \ New Zealand life;  an adventure of camping, gold panning, hiking up mountains,\
  \ getting drunk in the middle of the night, walking through the park, waiting in\
  \ line for famous burgers, travelling to places where movies were filmed, walking\
  \ up canyons in freezing cold water, and living the life I had only imagined from\
  \ my cold winter home where I had been hibernating. \nHe introduced me to his friends,\
  \ a myriad of wonderful humans from many different cultures; Australia, Germany,\
  \ New Zealand, Scotland, Finland, United States, and our native Canada. \nHe taught\
  \ me so many things when I was here; how to trust, how to accept love from someone,\
  \ how to be myself without worrying what other people thought, how to take chances,\
  \ and how to smile and laugh. \nHe helped me out of the depression I was suffering\
  \ from due to my past relationships and I was able to forgive the people I had been\
  \ unable to forgive for so many years. I saw the most beautiful landscapes and spent\
  \ hours hiking up mountains I didn\u2019t think I could climb, but with his encouragement\
  \ I felt able to tackle anything. \nI realized how important it is to cherish and\
  \ value the little moments in life from him; from filling up the car with gas, buying\
  \ me a small present because he wanted to see me smile, to bringing me a coffee\
  \ when he knew I had to work early mornings. \nI had the courage to return to Canada\
  \ with a smile on my face and a positive attitude and I knew I could face the last\
  \ few weeks we would be apart because we would be together again.  The magic of\
  \ our new life fills my soul and I could never go back to the way things were before\
  \ I came to New Zealand."
