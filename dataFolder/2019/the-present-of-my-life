Text: "28th June 2018. It was my first time abroad so I was really excited. I was\
  \ going to Stockholm, Sweden, on my college vocations and I\u2019ve been dreaming\
  \ with that trip for months but I really didn\u2019t expeted find what I found there.\
  \ I stayed at my aunt\u2019s house. She lives there with her husband. Their names\
  \ are Regina and Christer.\n\nI have knew that I would travel to Sweden since December\
  \ 2017 and when I looked for places to visited or things to do in Stockholm on the\
  \ internet, I always imagined we three going to museums, restaurants or riding by\
  \ bike. And for me these things would be so nice. But actually we would do more\
  \ than that. \n\nWhen I came there, they were still working but I could go alone\
  \ in some museums I wanted to visit. One of the museums I visited was The Vasa Museum\
  \ and it was incredible. Everything looked like real and the technology used is\
  \ amazing. But some days before that we went at a Christer\u2019s friend\u2019s\
  \ house. It was his bisthday so he was having a party. There were so many people\
  \ there and I thought I wouldn\u2019t talk to anyone but make new friends was easier\
  \ than I thought it would be. First of all, I got really surprised because the conversations\
  \ flowed spontaneosly so this way I could practice my English skills and, at the\
  \ same time, I could realized most of my English skills were good and I didn\u2019\
  t know. Secondly, people were really kind and friendly with me and I thought swedish\
  \ people weren\u2019t so kind like they were.\n\nAnd on the second week the travel\
  \ surprises started. Firstly, I have to say that I never knew what we are going\
  \ to do or what we are going to go. Whatever it was. So, one day my aunt told me:\
  \ \u201CPack your bag. We are leaving tomorrow afternoon. I will tell you what kind\
  \ of clothes you should wear.\u201D And I just said ok. We left house at the appointed\
  \ time and when we arrived at our \u201Cdestine\u201D, I could\u2019t believe it.\
  \ We were going to Finland by ship. It was a unforgetable trip. I have never been\
  \ on a ship before. But I didn\u2019t know that this was just the beginning.\nOn\
  \ the following weeks more surprises came. I went to the Grona Lund, the amusement\
  \ park in Stockholm. It is relatively small, but at the moment I saw it I wanted\
  \ to visit it. My aunt said that it was expensive so I stopped talking about it.\
  \ But on a Wednesday morning we two were going to there and I didn\u2019t suspect\
  \ anything. It was my first time on a park also so it was really amazing fo me.\
  \ \n\nThen, Sunday came and we were going to somewhere I didn\u2019t know where\
  \ it was. I only knew when we got there. We were in Lilla Edets municipality in\
  \ V\xE4sterg\xF6tland. There was a lake there, called Pr\xE4ssebosj\xF6n, and we\
  \ stayed in a very cosy house. We got there for one week and we also visited others\
  \ cities around. We went in Trollh\xE4ttan and Sm\xF6gen where I could try one of\
  \ the most delicous seafood meal and appreciate a walk along the boardwalk. \nSo\
  \ we were leaving Lilla Edets on a Saturday and I thought I would stay at home for\
  \ a moment. But for the second time I was wrong. We are traveling again on a very\
  \ early Sunday and I only knew where we were going on the way to the airport. We\
  \ were going to Berlin, Germany. We got three days there and when I thought we were\
  \ coming home we were going to other place. This time they said where we were going.\
  \ Prague, Czech Republic. I got so excited that I couldn\u2019t sleep at night.\
  \ Prague is a really nice city and we stayed there for four days. Everything there\
  \ is incredible. I got really delighted. \n\nAnd we spent my last weekend in Sweden\
  \ in Flen. It was a really funny and amazing weekend. I learned how to play some\
  \ swedish games and how to play pocker also. So incredible!"
