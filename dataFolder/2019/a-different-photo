Text: "I visited Iran in summer 2017 knowing it would have been a country with a culture\
  \ quite different from mine and from that of other countries I visited. \nTo travel\
  \ also means to accept compromises: you are a guest in somebody else's home, therefore\
  \ you have to respect your host, and I knew I had to adapt to a different body language,\
  \ different social rules, a different dress code. In a way, I had to hide my self.\
  \ \nStill, as I found out during the days, I was a privileged one, with my European\
  \ passport and my fair eyes and complexion. \nEverywhere people spotted me as the\
  \ other, the stranger: I was an attraction, and everyone wanted a photo of this\
  \ attraction. Sometimes photos with me, but mostly photos of me. I was experiencing\
  \ what it feels like to be on the other side of the lens. \nI found myself in the\
  \ strange contraddiction of being a tourist, but a woman, a combination that placed\
  \ me in a somewhat uncanny position. \nWhile visiting a palace or walking through\
  \ the streets I was something that attracted them, something different that deserved\
  \ being photographed. Moreover, as a western tourist, I was granted a level of freedom\
  \ Iranian women were not allowed to. But seating in a restaurant or talking to a\
  \ taxi driver was a different matter: if it was possible to deal with a man, men\
  \ preferred not to talk to me, they avoided my gaze. It was like being stuck within\
  \ a photograph: still and mute as a monument. \nBut what struck more about that\
  \ was that this conflicted attitude towards the female genre in no way affected\
  \ their hospitability: the guest was sacred, and everybody everywhere was more than\
  \ eager to help you in any way, share their meal with you, open their house to you.\
  \ \nThey were conservative and welcoming at the same time, as if they wanted to\
  \ keep you close and distant, and the pictures they loved to take represented both\
  \ this aspects: they secured the strangeness on the film, rendering it harmless\
  \ and safe to look at, and therefore lessening the distance with what was depicted,\
  \ the representation of a world so far and yet so near. \nThe story of another photograph,\
  \ one in which I was not the main character, crossed my path in the middle of my\
  \ trip. \nWhile in Shiraz, I could not miss a visit to Persepoli, the ancient capital\
  \ of Persia, that was only 60 km from the city. I entered one of the local travel\
  \ agencies and booked a tour, and early in the morning the day after I was on an\
  \ old little bus, with some ten other tourists and Al\xEC, our young guide. \nDuring\
  \ a pause right after the first part of our tour, he looked back at the mythical\
  \ animals guarding the remains of the place, and started recounting something happened\
  \ to him few days before. \nIn one of his tours there was this French woman who\
  \ took a picture in front of the magnificent beasts of Persepoli. There was nothing\
  \ strange in it, as that was one of the most popular spot in which taking a picture\
  \ in the whole site, but actually she had a different aim: she wanted to retrace\
  \ the travel made by her mother in the early '70s, before the revolution. That picture\
  \ was taken in the exact spot her mother chose so many years before. In both cases,\
  \ next to the woman, stood the dignified guardian, eternal relic of the palace burnt\
  \ down almost two thousands years ago. \nIn the unchanged landscape of the picture\
  \ was possible to recognise the evolution of the country in the last forty years.\
  \ One of the photos depicted a smiling woman, with a top tank, and her hair flowing\
  \ freely on her shoulders, while in the other one there was still a smiling woman,\
  \ but in a more conservative attire: the only visible part of her body was her face,\
  \ and her hair was covered by a hijab. This last one was the more recent one. \n\
  Time flows, but, sometimes, not in the direction expected."
