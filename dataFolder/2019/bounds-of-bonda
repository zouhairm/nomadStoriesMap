Text: "Rough, calloused bare feet are stepping down a terracotta road. Their scrawny\
  \ naked hips are swaying to the silent beat of the procession. A dirty sack packed\
  \ with goods or a shiny massive jar of alcohol rests on their heads. Beautiful beaded\
  \ necklaces and an empty canvas shopping bag are in their hands. These are the women\
  \ of the Bonda tribe who are determined to get to the market to meet the inhabitants\
  \ of surrounding villages.\n\nI am in Odisha, India. I stand on a halfway to the\
  \ Onucadelli market in a remote part of the state. For many kilometers of vast lands\
  \ around there are only villages of primitive tribes and the nature. The market\
  \ itself is a small patch of land on a hill, where all sorts of barter items are\
  \ laid out right on the ground.\n\nI am with a guide: tourists are forbidden to\
  \ appear here alone. Essentially, the market is the only place where we can witness\
  \ Bonda: the entrance to their villages is strictly limited by the state, and the\
  \ tribals themselves are not fond of strangers. The Bonda people are short-tempered\
  \ and get angry easily. For example, my guide warned me that I must not take pictures\
  \ of men. A snapshot can cost an arrow from a Bonda man's bow straight into my heart.\n\
  \nFortunately, the Bonda women are more loyal: tourists are a great source of income\
  \ for them. Should you wish to take a selfie, pay 10 rupees and she will strike\
  \ a pose and smile to the camera. Rare tourists who manage to get to the place eagerly\
  \ pay for the imprintable experience of the aboriginal burlesque: the Bonda ladies\
  \ are semi-naked.\n\nUnlike men, only the Bonda women are dressed traditionally.\
  \ Their attire is a very short skirt called ringa, multiple strings of bids, thick\
  \ silver or bronze neck rings, and big earrings. As it is winter, many of them also\
  \ have a blue shawl knotted in front. \n\n_Ramayana, the famous Sanskrit epics of\
  \ ancient India, says that once upon a time Sita, the goddess of good fortune, prosperity,\
  \ success, and happiness, was bathing at a pond in the Bonda hills. Some Bonda women\
  \ chanced upon her and sniggered. Sita was furious and cursed them to a life where\
  \ they would be condemned to remaining naked and having their heads shaven. The\
  \ Bonda women pleaded forgiveness, and the generous Sita took pity and gave them\
  \ a piece of cloth she tore off her sari, the ringa that covers their waist._\n\n\
  The upper body of a Bonda woman is covered with long necklaces of colourful beads\
  \ which they collect in forests or buy on the market. Very persistently, they try\
  \ to pitch the necklaces to the tourists. They mutter the price walking along the\
  \ market with a bundle of beaded strings. Bonda mostly speak Remo, their own dying\
  \ language, and know only a few words in Oria, the language of Odisha. Along with\
  \ their primitive feisty sales technique, it is just as much as they need to get\
  \ the business done. \n\nAloof a dozen of the Bonda women surrounded a strapping\
  \ strong Dutch man like a tiny harem with the armful of gifts for their master (the\
  \ Bonda people are relatively short, about 1.5 meters tall). Suddenly it hits me\
  \ how much surrealism and comedy the contrast between the Dutch and Bonda adds to\
  \ the scene. Yet, hardly could I do something more real and authentic then being\
  \ here in Onukadelli. \n\nAfter the trading is done, the Bonda start drinking alcohol\
  \ which they produce from coconut palm, rice or a local flower. My guide explains\
  \ that the alcohol means a lot to them. It is more important than food. In fact,\
  \ it\u2019s the booze that makes the whole tribe extinct rather than the cultural\
  \ assimilation or depletion of resources. Straight away, I see them greedily swallowing\
  \ the content of improvised pots made of a local fruit shell \u2013 portion by portion.\
  \  \n\nIn the afternoon, certainly much less elegantly than in the morning, the\
  \ bare footed Bonda will walk back about 13 kilometers home. The following Thursday\
  \ they will take the same journey until the very end of every Bonda\u2019s life."
