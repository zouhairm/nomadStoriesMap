Text: "Protests in P\xE9rigord: \nHow I accidentally became an environmental activist\n\
  \n\u201CDo you see him up there? That\u2019s J\xE9r\xE9mie.\u201D My host Django\
  \ pointed at a small figure standing on a makeshift wooden platform several meters\
  \ up in the crane. Beside him, a white banner hung down, flapping gently in the\
  \ brisk November wind. On it were written messages of defiance in red and black\
  \ paint. \n\nWhen I had pictured my visit to France, I hadn\u2019t imagined that\
  \ I would find myself involved in an environmental protest. Yet, throughout my stay\
  \ of just over a week in the P\xE9rigord region, Django, his mother Danielle, and\
  \ I made the trip down to the riverbank to visit the site of the ZAD nearly every\
  \ day (the original acronym \u201CZone \xC0 D\xE9velopper\u201D \u2013 designated\
  \ project areas assigned by the government \u2013 had been given new meaning by\
  \ the environmentalists and protesters: \u201CZone \xC0 D\xE9fendre\u201D).\n\n\
  We drove down winding roads \u2013 past castles, fields and countless farmhouses\
  \ of beige stone. As we emerged from the treed hills, the Dordogne river valley\
  \ opened up before us. The earth rose comfortably on either side of the flowing\
  \ water, gently framing the river from a distance like a soft embrace. \n\nThe crane\
  \ in which J\xE9r\xE9mie remained camped for several days stood immobile, waiting\
  \ patiently to resume its work on a bridge \u2013 one of two which had been planned\
  \ by the local government to connect a new road. The new route had been deemed necessary\
  \ by regional officials in order to eliminate traffic congestion during the market\
  \ season \u2013 a time spanning but a couple weeks in July. At an informational\
  \ meeting hosted by the environmental protest group in the town of Sarlat-la-Can\xE9\
  da one evening later that week, I would learn that this new road would save the\
  \ commuter only a few minutes at most and would be of little value for the remaining\
  \ 50 weeks of the year. \n\nEach day, it grew colder. When I awoke, still chilly\
  \ under seven layers of blankets, my thoughts went to J\xE9r\xE9mie, who had spent\
  \ another night exposed to the elements. I imagined him up there in the dark, shivering\
  \ on his small platform, nothing but his backpack of diminishing food and water\
  \ to keep him company, and the policemen pacing below. \n\nMy peaceful days of tending\
  \ the garden, feeding the ewes, and going for long runs and walks among the rolling\
  \ hills were broken up with the high thrum of revolutionary energy. It was felt\
  \ at meals as Django discussed ongoing issues in the country and developments at\
  \ the ZAD while we ate bread and homemade pumpkin soup. The energy was an electric\
  \ current among the group of twenty or so loyal protestors, offering food, water\
  \ and moral support at the protest site, or holding a banner in a town street, painted\
  \ with bright fish in all the colours of the rainbow and the words: \u201CSauvons\
  \ la Rivi\xE8re\u201D (Save the River). That same banner would be held in front\
  \ of the gendarmerie when J\xE9r\xE9mie was eventually caught and brought into custody.\n\
  \nOn my final day at the farmhouse, I walked through the surrounding woods. I climbed\
  \ up land shaped into flat tiers like a huge staircase with each step edged by walls\
  \ of stone. When I asked Django about this, he said that the levels were most likely\
  \ built hundreds of years ago by the family who owned the farmhouse above at the\
  \ time, in order to create flat ground on which to grow grapes.\n\nIn a place where\
  \ things felt so ancient, so constant, it was hard to imagine that there existed\
  \ a fragile ecosystem which could be destroyed beyond the point of no return. \n\
  \nDown in the valley, the river flowed on in the evening glow, unaware of the power\
  \ it possessed to give life or take it away. Thankfully, upon its banks stood those\
  \ willing to fight for it."
