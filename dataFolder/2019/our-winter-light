Text: "She came at us so fast, we didn\u2019t have time to move. Covered from head\
  \ to toe in glitter, she left a blaze of sparkles behind her as she slithered back\
  \ and forth. The woman, draped in bits of fabric and Mardi Gras beads, jingled as\
  \ she circled us, hissing and waving her hands. The crowd pressed together, as far\
  \ away from the scene as they could, leaving us trapped between a light post and\
  \ on-coming traffic. Suddenly, she reared back, as if to strike, before throwing\
  \ herself at my friend. Unsure as to whether she was going to bite her or snatch\
  \ her bag, I shoved the women into the wall of people. Then we ran, not stopping\
  \ till we were sure she was far behind us. Out of breath and hopelessly lost somewhere\
  \ in Soho, we looked at each other and burst out laughing.\n    We later joked we\
  \ had been cursed. What had started out as a pretty straightforward day of sightseeing\
  \ suddenly turned disastrous. After a series of incidents involving Indian food,\
  \ a phone charger, and the British Museum, the day culminated in us running 8 blocks\
  \ to catch an overnight bus to Edinburgh, only to find the last remaining seats\
  \ were up front next to the driver. Exhausted, we collapsed into our chairs as the\
  \ driver turned around with a big grin and said, \u201CIt\u2019s good to have people\
  \ to talk to on these overnight drives.\u201D I could hear my friend groan inwardly\
  \ as we settled in for a very long night.\n    Traveling with a friend is always\
  \ risky. The person I enjoy meeting for coffee on a Saturday is not necessarily\
  \ the same person with whom I\u2019d choose to roam the streets of London, under\
  \ a cloud of black magic. My friend and I had known each other a long time-long\
  \ enough to anticipate each other\u2019s idiosyncrasies. She is always so fierce\
  \ and determined, not easily swayed from whatever she sets her mind to. I am a little\
  \ flakey, at best. The trip could have gone either way, really.\n    Our lives had\
  \ mirrored one another\u2019s in the rapid succession of major life events that\
  \ had occurred since we met in college. At some point along the way an opportunity\
  \ arose. She stayed and bought a house with a garden. I went, venturing out into\
  \ the world in search of the kind of beauty she chose to create right where she\
  \ was. My life became increasingly nomadic, as hers became grounded. Maybe we both\
  \ envied one another a bit over the years. There were times when I craved deep roots\
  \ like the ones she had established. I sensed she sometimes wished for the freedom\
  \ and flexibility only a family with no real home can know.\n    \u201CNow is the\
  \ time to travel and explore while we are young,\u201D a wise, 20-something-year-old\
  \ traveler from Australia announced to us in a hostel one night. \u201CThis will\
  \ all be much harder if we have families and real jobs someday.\u201D My friend\
  \ and I suppressed a smile, recognizing advice we would have given ourselves a decade\
  \ ago. The girl had no idea how right she was.\n    As we climbed Arthur\u2019s\
  \ Seat, high above Edinburgh, I thought about how I didn\u2019t expect to find a\
  \ friendship like this in what has turned out to be a somewhat lonely way of living.\
  \ There has been no shortage of people in my life, but with friends scattered across\
  \ the globe, it is hard to know if that friendship is built on anything more substantial\
  \ than the thrill and impulse of travel.\n    Our trip had been planned around so\
  \ many things other than Scottish weather patterns, but we were lucky. A deluge\
  \ of mid-November sunlight enveloped us as we reach the top of the mountain. For\
  \ a brief moment, our parallel lives occupied the same space. We were both just\
  \ travelers, exploring new places. This time was special and we both knew it would\
  \ be hard to come by again. We knew each other well enough not to say a word. It\
  \ was enough to sit in the wonder and beauty of the diffused, winter light."
