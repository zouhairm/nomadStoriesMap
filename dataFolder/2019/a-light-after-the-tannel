Text: "Born in the midst of a twisted world, a world caught between Black and White,\
  \ freedom and oppression.\n\nA young boy who was brought to this world right in\
  \ the center of it all, had to adjust to all the mix match, choose what path to\
  \ go by, even the whole world was confused.\n\nGrowing up was taught and challenging\
  \ for a young black man, nothing they ever do is right in the society's eyes, and\
  \ it will never be. He grew up with two other siblings his father the only male\
  \ finger he has ever know left when he was only 6 years old. Raised by a single\
  \ african woman might seem easy but it\u2019s taught . Their mother had to work\
  \ two jobs to make ends meet. Her kids moved around from relative to relative while\
  \ the mother had to work day in a day out, years went by with the same circle of\
  \ moving around their own home lost its value,  each relative help themselves with\
  \ whatever they wanted that was in their family house one of them literally employed\
  \ the house down and the onlything that was left was the walls with no roof.\n\n\
  By this time His mother work at a farm that was 500km away from home, and was only\
  \ able to visit for two days once a year, his sisters out of control doing who knows\
  \ what as they don't know which is which or what is what. Even though he was the\
  \ middle child, he had to act old and man\n\n*to be continued *"
