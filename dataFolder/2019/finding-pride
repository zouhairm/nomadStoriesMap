Text: "This is a mistake. There's still time to go back. I don't have to do this.\
  \ These and countless other doubts swam through my mind as I approached the festival.\
  \ I've never been fond of crowded places; the noise, smells, filth, potential pickpocketing,\
  \ and the churning, chaotic mass of bodies bring out my inner agoraphobic. Over\
  \ the last year, I'd been making an effort to go to more events and open up. I knew\
  \ I couldn't grow as a person otherwise. I was in luck, too; San Francisco is always\
  \ bursting with events by the time June arrives. I had dozens of options, free time\
  \ to spare, and no excuses. But this... This was different.\n\nThis was Pride.\n\
  \nYou've probably seen the photos and videos. The rainbow flags, drag queens, sparkly\
  \ costumes, and all those other staples that make LGBTQ culture recognizable and\
  \ palatable to outside audiences. It's more complicated than that, of course; as\
  \ an event, Pride can have as many meanings as there are people who attend. For\
  \ me, it was about taking a risk. Not just because I dislike crowds, but due to\
  \ my lack of self-acceptance. I'd known as I was different for as long as I could\
  \ remember. If the terms 'non-binary' and 'genderfluid' had been better understood\
  \ 30 years ago, I might've grown up a happier person. But that didn't happen.\n\n\
  As I waded deeper into Pride, I felt like I'd gotten lost. I'd hiked those same\
  \ streets by Civic Center dozens of times, but now it looked like another planet.\
  \ There were nearly a million people crammed into a few blocks, dozens of booths\
  \ lining the sidewalks, countless food and beer stands, costumed dancers and pop\
  \ music roaring over loudspeakers on massive stages, the early summer heat shimmering\
  \ on the pavement... It was too much. I held my camera with an iron grip and shuffled\
  \ through it all in a self-conscious daze. I wasn't fabulous and flamboyant enough\
  \ for this swirling sea of rainbows, glitter, and raw exuberance. Why was I even\
  \ here?\n\nI caught my breath at a souvenir stand. Like any festival, Pride thrives\
  \ on the merchandise. A kind, older lesbian couple had a great selection of t-shirts,\
  \ key chains, banners, the usual. I was more drawn to their huge variety of pins.\
  \ They had some representing each flag of the LGBTQ community, as well as a handy\
  \ little sign explaining the designations. I must've been staring awkwardly for\
  \ too long, because one of the women walked over and gave me a smile.\n\n\"Nice\
  \ pins, huh? Which would you like, sweetie?\"\n\nI took a step back. I hadn't planned\
  \ on being noticed. I scanned the sign and picked up a couple of pins, one for each\
  \ part of my identity that I'd never verbalized before.\n\n\"Um, these ones.\" Why\
  \ was I mumbling? Why was this so hard?\n\n\"Non-binary and genderfluid. Got it,\
  \ let me just ring you up...\"\n \nAs I drifted away, I gazed silently at the little\
  \ trinkets in my hand. I didn't have to do anything with them. I could just take\
  \ them home, put them in a box, and let them collect dust. No one would know...\
  \ But I would. I would know that I had come to this wonderful, crazy festival, acknowledged\
  \ an aspect of myself that I'd kept hidden for so long, and faltered at the last\
  \ second. I'd never forgive myself for stopping now. I needed to grow. So I stuck\
  \ both pins into my backpack straps where they'd be perfectly visible to everyone,\
  \ and kept walking. \n\nI expected some kind of attack or confrontation - I'd survived\
  \ and won my fair share over the years - but none came. I was just another LGBTQ\
  \ person celebrating themselves and others like them. Ironically, the very thing\
  \ that made me feel like an outcast in my childhood now made me blend in perfectly.\
  \ After a few hours of wandering the festival and taking photos, I wearily trudged\
  \ back to the subway for the ride home. As the train rumbled to life and left Pride\
  \ behind, I sat back, closed my eyes, and breathed out.\n\nI should've done this\
  \ a long time ago."
