Text: "I met Vicente on the 8 bus in Madrid after two weeks of living in Spain. It\
  \ was my first day of teaching at my K-5 bilingual school, and I was a bundle of\
  \ nerves, barely knowing Spanish or where I was going. The latter was my real concern,\
  \ as I glanced anxiously at the bus stops as they ticked pass, looking for my own,\
  \ but not quite confident that I was going to make it off the right one to connect\
  \ to the bus that would take me an hour outside of the city. An older man in a fashionable\
  \ overcoat and a dark blue beret looked up at me slyly over his El Pais newspaper,\
  \ clearly sensing my utter confusion. \"Sabes tu parada?\" he gently asked me. I\
  \ froze, aware that my elementary Spanish would fail me at any moment. \"Matador,\"\
  \ I whispered back. His face lit up and he exclaimed, \"Es mio, tambien!\" and I\
  \ breathed a sigh of relief, but not for long. Unfortunately, he mistook me instantly\
  \ for a well-versed Spanish traveler, which I was not, and continued in a rapid\
  \ succession of Spanish that I could understand --- nada of. After a minute of my\
  \ blank stare and awkward \"No entiendo,\" he took the hint. \"Vale, vale, estamos\
  \ aqui.\" We had made it to our stop. I breathed again, shook his hand, passed him\
  \ a timid \"gracias,\" and never expected to see him again.\n\nLittle did I know\
  \ that for the next 10 months, I would see Vicente every day, Monday through Thursday,\
  \ on bus 8 on my way to school. Looking back, this is no shocking coincidence of\
  \ fate (I saw multiple of the same people daily as we shared the same work commutes),\
  \ but what WAS an act of fate were the small moments that came to follow that would\
  \ form a lifelong friendship between seemingly vastly different people. \n\nIt began\
  \ as most interactions with passing familiar faces do, a nod and a \"buenas dias.\"\
  \ After a few weeks of that, one day Vicente asked if he could sit beside me on\
  \ the bus, which I happily obliged. He spoke to me in the slowest, most patient\
  \ Spanish he could muster (he didn\xB4t speak a word of English), and told me about\
  \ his family. His wife Peppa worked for the government and was \"la jefa\" (the\
  \ boss) of the family, his daughter Julia lived in South Africa and spoke perfect\
  \ English, and his son, who was a brilliant mathematician, had decided ultimately\
  \ to become a professional clown. I told him about my family too and my hopes for\
  \ my time in Madrid and my future. As the months passed, I learned about his wilder\
  \ days as a young boy in Valencia, he knew all the names of my most precocious Spanish\
  \ students, and about a week before the winter holidays kicked into full swing,\
  \ he invited me to dinner at his home and to meet his family.\n\nNow, I know what\
  \ you may be thinking. 25 year old, American girl meets 60 something Madrileno on\
  \ the bus who invites her to dinner, must be sketchy, right? Wrong. The thing that\
  \ I learned quickly after moving to Spain was that this country was very different\
  \ than my own. People offer you a helping hand even when you may not speak their\
  \ language, and when they offer you a meal and a chance to meet their families,\
  \ its not just a dinner invite. Its an offering to be a part of a family. That evening,\
  \ after a few months of meeting Vicente, I stepped inside his quaint home to be\
  \ greeted with joyous besos from Peppa, a warm, and perfect English greeting from\
  \ Julia, and the overwhelmingly aromatic smell of fresh paella in the kitchen. I\
  \ sat down with this family I had just met and instantly felt I had found a second\
  \ home in the city I wanted so desperately to be apart of. When I was heading for\
  \ the door, Vicente handed me a bag full of fresh oranges he and Peppa handpicked\
  \ in Valencia. \"Para ti, Victoria, y gracias por tu compania.\" \"No,\" I wanted\
  \ to tell him. \"Thank you for yours.\""
