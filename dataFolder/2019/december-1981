Text: "Long ago in December of 1981 I was returning from Italy to the US the way we\
  \ did back then on limited funds: the train to Brussels then a flight to NY. The\
  \ train ride was long and cold with frequent stops and delays due to the snow. When\
  \ we arrived in Brussels at 11 pm my plan of sleeping in a chair at the airport\
  \ till my flight the next morning was cancelled.  With a few internationally recognized\
  \ words, sign language and facial expressions the woman sitting behind me told me\
  \ the airport closes at night. With no place warm to go, no local money in my pocket\
  \ and not speaking the local language I became a bit disoriented.. Sensing this\
  \ she instructed me to go with her. So I went, I really had no choice. I was not\
  \ dressed for the winter in Brussels and the long walk through the snowy streets\
  \ lugging my yellow suitcase (no wheels of course) was difficult. Then we arrived.\
  \ Up the stairs with the luggage into what seemed to be a scarsly heated apartment.\
  \ Her boyfriend, I assumed that was who he was, became furious and animated as she\
  \ explained why I was there. I didn\u2019t understand a word they were saying, which\
  \ was to my benefit, but he obviously didn\u2019t trust me. Who was I?  She smiled,\
  \ waved his apprehensions away and  proceeded to serve me tea, bread and jam, then\
  \ showed me to a room to sleep. It was dark, but I could see some guitars and musical\
  \ stuff. Before retiring I showed her my plane ticket and pointed out what time\
  \ my plane departed.  I didn\u2019t sleep a wink it was so cold. But early the next\
  \ morning she came and knocked on the door. We had to leave. I had no idea how to\
  \ express my gratitude for her hospitality, kindness and trust in me and for saving\
  \ me from the frigid cold. All I could do was emply my pockets of the remaing few\
  \ Italian Lire I had and put them on the kitchen table..  She was surprised probably\
  \ not expecting anything, probably because it was not a sought after currency back\
  \ then. We left the appartment and she showed me how to get to the airport and left\
  \ me standing on the street corner. I used the rest of my train ticket from the\
  \ previous night and made it to the airport. \nOver the years, I have often thought\
  \ about this magical experience :  having to trust a total stranger with whom you\
  \ cannot properly communicate.  I was so lucky and blessed .......   someone was\
  \ watching over me that night."
