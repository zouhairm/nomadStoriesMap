Text: "I reassured him that I wasn\u2019t alone; I had him.  Stolidly, my fianc\xE9\
  \ didn\u2019t agree with me traveling with such compromised health, \u201CIt will\
  \ take 6 hours if we don\u2019t stop at all. You don\u2019t need to go back there,\
  \ for someone else.\u201D He peered at me the way the female beggars in burka did,\
  \ with strong hope I\u2019d give him something. Anything. \n\nCertainly my silence\
  \ to such a viable subject seemed brutish, but there was a more effeminate undercurrent\
  \ flowing within me. Being in my first trimester of pregnancy with an enthralling\
  \ hunger for being brave I wished to source and solidify the kind of mother I would\
  \ be. I hadn\u2019t been able to keep anything down after contracting a stomach\
  \ bug in the rural waters of Doukalla, El Jadida two days before. \n\nThe sound\
  \ of the dusty Dacia Sandero car door closing and further requiring to be pushed\
  \ in to its entirety struck a monologue in my mind paralleling the motivation of\
  \ this trip. I watched my fianc\xE9 walk towards the cryptically arched entrance\
  \ of the Rabat medina to purchase cumin heavy, divinely charred chicken quarters\
  \ for me to help sustain me for the remainder of the drive.\n\nWe were set out to\
  \ continue to Essaouira to meet Danielle who had embarked on an 18th century tall\
  \ sailing ship from Lunenburg, Nova Scotia and had been at sea for four months in\
  \ conditions she described as holding a negative mind set matching the age of the\
  \ ship and filled with toil. Our mutual friend set up this meeting stating it was\
  \ imperative that us two relentlessly wonder-filled, women meet. \n\nI requested\
  \ Danielle bring me Jamaican curry powder and any English book from her previous\
  \ port stops. Only Arabic script was available, reminding me how displaced I was.\
  \ The many Jamaican curried dishes I made while in Morocco helped me win hearts\
  \ when culture came between us. I would surely need more when I would announce to\
  \ my fianc\xE9s parents that I was with child.  Danielle requested we bring her\
  \ tea. \n\nMy stubborn intuition told me this re-travel was disparate and exigent\
  \ in air.  As we took to the highway, I opened the most recent email from Danielle.\
  \ She shared that she had fallen ill from stress and was considering quitting the\
  \ journey at this port. \n\nWe arrived late in the morning to the once Portugese\
  \ colonized port of Essaouira, in the daring moonlight - no soul yet up for prayer.\
  \ A reluctant \u201Csemtar\u201D (rental agent who dangles keys in the main arteries\
  \ into the city \u2013 waiting to be picked up for hire) took us to one home where\
  \ the woman fearfully declined.  \n\nThe semtar\u2019s barritone register vibrated\
  \ quintessential questions beneath remarking, \u201CYou both are not yet married.\
  \ No one wants any trouble.\u201D The triune of committed stares that followed were\
  \ marred with pleas of different origin. They converged. The semtar promised he\
  \ would find a willing renter \u2013 which he did. \n\nThe next day, Danielle picked\
  \ us up in a Dinghy boat and gave us a tour of the pirate-like vessel. Every misplaced\
  \ splint and squeak of sweat-filled wood echoed her troubled stories. My fianc\xE9\
  \ was in existence-shifting awe being on the water for the first time. He decided\
  \ to bring Danielle to Imsouane (a near-by surfer town perched on the edge of a\
  \ cliffside to show her a mood-altering sunset we had once experienced. Danielle\
  \ felt terribly land sick along the travel. As if scanning for ammunition mid-battle,\
  \ I quickly searched my bag for Valencia grape juice and Oulmes carbonated water\
  \ to share with her. Imsouane lost electricity that night. The now candle-laden\
  \ town accompanied by its intrinsic mahogany-tinged sunset cast out all question\
  \ of why we had been called to meet. Our share presence was the mirrored healing\
  \ we equally didn\u2019t know we needed.\n\nPerhaps the days you feel like avoiding\
  \ the next step are calls instead, to go the complete distance. We shared a collection\
  \ of small exchanges destined from afar that painted a once-taken journey brand\
  \ new with hope to face the challenges that remained ahead and revealed that there\
  \ is unsung wonder in having nomadic eyes, twice."
