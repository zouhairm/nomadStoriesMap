Text: "Once upon a time, in the nation of hunters, a bird was very famous and popular.\
  \ The bird\u2019s name was Simurgh, all the people had heard of it but no one ever\
  \ saw it. Simurgh is a Dari word whose meaning is a bird of 30 wings which was mysterious.\
  \ It was a rumor that the bird lives in the highest mountains and anyone who has\
  \ ever gone to find it, had never returned back. Moreover, people used to talk about\
  \ the bird\u2019s traits, such as anyone who eats the meat of Simurgh will gain\
  \ the power 30 Ironmen, anyone who carries a pair of Simurgh's legs at house no\
  \ disasters will come to that house, the skeleton is worth thousands, clothes made\
  \ of the feather of Simurgh will be warm in winters and cold in summers and a hundred\
  \ more traits. But among those people, it was a dream to find one and sell it with\
  \ a very high price.\n\nIn the same city, there was a farmer who had nothing with\
  \ the hunting and birds, he went to the hills and mountains to collect some rare\
  \ plants called Samaruq, so he went to the mountains for one month. He had two children,\
  \ Happy and Natasha, Happy was 7 and Natasha was 5, the farmer loved them a lot.\
  \ One day, when the season of plants arrived, the farmer said that he was going\
  \ to the mountains to collect some Samaruq. Happy and Natasha who had never seen\
  \ an enormous mountain before were very eager to explore one and experience it.\
  \ The farmer who knew the dangers and difficulties of the high mountains didn\u2019\
  t agree with the children. They went to their mother Dilaraam and asked her to convince\
  \ him to let them go. She talked with the farmer and after a long argument, she\
  \ succeeded to convince him.\n\nAutumn, the season of beautiful colors, when the\
  \ leaves leave the trees, when the birds migrate when the sky brings the news of\
  \ winter and snow; along with their weak donkey and wheelbarrow they started their\
  \ one-month journey to the mountains. The first 3 days were just passed walking\
  \ upwards. The fourth day, they arrived at the beginning point of the area that\
  \ Samaruq was visible, the farmer told his kids to go and find some plants but don\u2019\
  t go so far. Happy and Natasha started looking for Samaruq and were successful in\
  \ finding some. They came to the farmer and showed him the plant and he became extremely\
  \ happy, they ate some boiled eggs and wheat bread and slept. The other days, they\
  \ were more motivated to find more plants, Happy and Natasha started a competition\
  \ of the most plants. So every day each of them tried to fetch more plants to make\
  \ father happier. By the passing of each day, they climbed higher in the mountains\
  \ and tried harder to find Samaruq. It was the 10th day, as usual, they went to\
  \ fetch plants, this day Happy and Natasha went together.\n\nIt was almost the last\
  \ parts of the area that Samaruq could be found, they were collecting the plant,\
  \ all of a sudden they heard a loud roaring sound, they got scared and hid behind\
  \ a stone looking for the source. Happy was looking at the ground, but Natasha told\
  \ him: \u201CLook up\u201D. There was a giant luminous orange-colored bird that\
  \ they haven\u2019t ever seen in their lives. Happy said: \u201Cwhat is this?\u201D\
  \ Natasha replied: \u201CDon\u2019t you know? It\u2019s Simurgh\u201D They followed\
  \ the bird and reached to her nest, there were 2 eggs. The bird put some firewood\
  \ and flew away. The kids took the eggs and escaped.\n\nThey didn\u2019t say anything\
  \ about it to anyone, but they carried the eggs. Happy was too impatient, so broke\
  \ the egg and got nothing. But Natasha carried the egg with herself for 17 months\
  \ and took care of it and kept it warm. One day she heard the egg making some noise\
  \ and the bird broke the egg from inside and it was a Simurgh.\n\nMoral: If the\
  \ egg is broken by outside force, life ends, if broken by inside force, life begins.\
  \ Great things always begin from inside."
