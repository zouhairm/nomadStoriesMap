Text: "Silence. \n\nDharma and I had been sitting in silence all evening. It was a\
  \ quaint home-stay, 7200 feet up in the Himalayas, in the happiest country of the\
  \ world. My solo journey through Bhutan had taken many dramatic turns so far. But\
  \ this evening was in sharp contrast to those last couple of days. Absolute silence.\n\
  \ \nI enjoyed the peace for a while. My host at the home-stay was young and stout.\
  \ She maintained a straight face while clearing up the living room. She moved with\
  \ quiet footsteps on the thick woolen carpet. Without asking, and without being\
  \ asked, I did my share of work. I stacked up the books and arranged our shoes near\
  \ the door. I was the only guest staying there that night. Perfect silence. \n\n\
  How do you know when silence crosses the fine line between serene and awkward? \n\
  \nI was exhausted after the long journey. Perhaps Dharma was tired too. Polite smiles\
  \ were exchanged once in a while, after which eyes quickly focused back on the pages\
  \ of the magazines that we were flipping through. Do I start a conversation? How?\
  \ Would she be interested in talking? I needed to stay awake long enough to maintain\
  \ my sleep cycle. Should I retreat into my room? Would it be rude to do that? The\
  \ living room was nice. The warmth of the living room came from the carpets, the\
  \ color on the walls, the wooden architecture and the traditional artifacts all\
  \ around. I focused on these in an almost meditative state, taking in the smallest\
  \ of details in my current environment. Many little statues of Buddha. A tapestry.\
  \ An elegant low table with seating all around. The sound of insects. My nose was\
  \ starting to feel a little cold. I think there was something on the glass of my\
  \ spectacles. Was it dust? A slight itch. \n\nA sudden bright light drew me out\
  \ of this trance. \n\nAt 8.30 pm, it was time to switch on the television. I turned\
  \ my attention to Dharma who was browsing through an array of channels and settled\
  \ comfortably into her cushion after stopping at a movie channel. I believe that\
  \ the smile that came to my face was involuntary and instant. I was expecting a\
  \ local Bhutanese channel, perhaps the daily news, but Dharma\u2019s choice confused\
  \ and amused me at the same time. The dashing actor Suriya was staring at the two\
  \ of us intensely through the screen and delivering sharp dialogues in Telugu. Neither\
  \ the girl from the Himalayas, nor the one from the Northern Plains of India understood\
  \ what this super star of South Indian cinema was going on about. I think it was\
  \ an intense family drama unfolding in front of us. I didn\u2019t understand, but\
  \ I was smiling nonetheless. \n\n\u201CYou see South Indian film?\u201D Dharma broke\
  \ the ice between us. Her na\xEFve question turned my polite smile into a genuinely\
  \ happy one. \n\n\u201CThree times I see this film.\u201D So Dharma was a real fan!\
  \ Now I was the awkward girl trying to find the right words to respond with. \n\n\
  Again. \u201CI love Suriya. This actor. So handsome.\u201D I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but laugh with joy. Dharma and I had discovered our shared appreciation of South\
  \ Indian actors with sharp jawlines and beards. \n\nI nodded frivolously, \u201C\
  Yes, yes. Very handsome. What is this story about?\u201D \n\nShe brought me up to\
  \ speed about the story-line during commercial breaks. Through smiles, shrugs and\
  \ broken English, we \u201Ctalked\u201D into the night \u2013 about Delhi, about\
  \ Paro, about airplanes, about shopping, about friends, and about food. Plurals,\
  \ conjugations and pronouns did not matter anymore. The rules of grammar which made\
  \ us jittery during school exams became irrelevant that evening. Instead of being\
  \ an art to be mastered, language became a mere tool to be used. All we needed to\
  \ communicate was our clear intention, confidence and a few simple words. We were\
  \ connected by a language that neither of us considered our own. But in belonging\
  \ to neither of us, English belonged to us both. \n\n\"Very late. Sleep.\" Dharma\
  \ was right. I needed to start my trek early the next morning."
