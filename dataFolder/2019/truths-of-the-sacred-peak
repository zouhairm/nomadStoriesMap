Text: "I am a skeptic believer. I always look for a new truth to redefine my pre-conceived\
  \ understanding and belief. So, I packed my bag and off I go on a solo journey to\
  \ the sacred peak, hoping to find one.\n\n***\n\nNuwara Eliya, Srilanka\n\nIt\u2019\
  s called Adam\u2019s peak. One would expect to find one of Prophet Adam\u2019s on\
  \ its peak. And yet after climbing its 5.500 steps for 3 hours in the middle of\
  \ a cold Christmas night and reach the summit, I found there lies an officially\
  \ acclaimed footprint of Buddha instead of Adam\u2019s, stored inside a white walled\
  \ and golden cone Buddhist temple.\nAdam\u2019s peak stands at 2,243m tall making\
  \ it the 2nd highest point in whole of Srilanka. Pilgrims have been attracted to\
  \ walk its path for over 2000 years. Alexander the Great and Ibn Batuta are two\
  \ big names who were recorded to have climbed it. The local call it Sripada or the\
  \ Sacred Footprint to honor the 1,8 m (5ft 11 inch) footstep mark on a rock at the\
  \ summit. The Hindus claim it to be one of Lord Shiva\u2019s. The Moslems and some\
  \ Christian thinks that it\u2019s Adam first set foot on earth after being exiled\
  \ from heaven. Some other Christians say it belongs to St. Thomas the apostle who\
  \ brought Christianity to South Asia. The Buddhist believe that the footstep was\
  \ left by Buddha when spread his teachings in Srilanka. Despite of these differing\
  \ beliefs, the Buddha version is the official one adopted by the Sri Lankan government\
  \ an obvious logical policy from a country which sets Buddhism as its official religion,\
  \ practiced by around 70% of its citizens.\n\nLike many other people, I started\
  \ the climb at around 2.30 am, leaving from Nallathaniya village at the foot of\
  \ the mountain, taking the shortest and easiest 2.2 kilometers track to reach the\
  \ peak. It was christmas morning, national holiday, a peak season for pilgrims.\
  \ On a night like that you can climb with almost no logistic. You won\u2019t even\
  \ need a headlamp to climb as all the path is light up, nor you would need a trekking\
  \ pole as the stairways were well built with iron stanchions to hold in some steep\
  \ elevations. There are also many tea houses all along the way, you can stop by\
  \ anytime you feel hungry or thirsty. One of the benefits of openly letting each\
  \ belief hold their own version of truth about the peak is that it attracts so many\
  \ pilgrims from every different religions. From economic stand point, it\u2019s\
  \ a good business decision.\n\nJust before the sunrise at 5.30 am, I arrived with\
  \ lines of tourists and pilgrims at the temple\u2019s entrance gate on top. Thousands\
  \ of us were concentrated only within 5 meters wide pathway, leaving no space between\
  \ bodies. It\u2019s far more packed than a busy Monday morning train in Tokyo. I\
  \ had to imagine myself to be a slick eel while cruising through the wave of pilgrims\
  \ exiting the temple. After almost an hour, I finally made it to the peak. I found\
  \ myself in a basketball-field sized slope with a charming Buddhist temple stood\
  \ in the middle. Chant of pilgrims, the sound of the bell ringing in a constant\
  \ interval fill the morning air with a sense of calmness. Colourful prayer flags\
  \ were erected from all over the corners. For a moment I felt like I was in Nepal\
  \ instead of Srilanka. I put myself in a queue to enter the main room of the temple\
  \ to see the footprint. Only one person at a time and no picture allowed. Two guards\
  \ with moustache were watching the line. When my turn finally came, my eyes searched\
  \ the floor of that 2x2m room to find the foot print shape. I almost couldn\u2019\
  t find it as it was all covered with flowers, brass pots, mantra papers and a lot\
  \ of coins and bills. As the guard told me to move fast, I walked out. I felt nothing\
  \ spiritual and sacred about the footprint.\n\nOn my way descending back to the\
  \ village, I talked to myself, did I found the truth I was looking for? Well, I\
  \ didn\u2019t find just one. I found many instead."
