Text: I didn't expect that ill get out of anxiety and depression and find myself.People
  now adays are so busy that they dont have time for themselves and they arent aware
  of it that they are harming themselves.I took a step out from my daily routine and
  travelled to the most peaceful place of India that is Manali.I met lots of unknown
  people in my journey and got a chance to know them,to know their language,culture
  and it made me so happy,i got connected with them so soon.When i reached Manali..i
  just closed my eyes and took a deep breathe and believe me my body felt so fresh
  and rejenuvenated.I felt so light and peaceful seeing the mountains covered with
  snow ,white roads,big pine trees,breezy and cold winds.That was super amazing.I
  felt myself..i felt like i got a chance to relive my life back..i felt i found myself
  back.I started loving myself and explaining myself tha my life isnt that bad as
  i think.It's not the bad life it's how you live your life.How u give your life a
  meaning.To travel is to live.Take every chance you get in life,because some things
  only happen once.One should go,fly,roam,travel,explore,journey,discover,adventure.Just
  go and travel,Before you run out of time.
