Text: "True to the bone known to be a wide open mind, knowing humans. Apart of the\
  \ fact of the universe is told and seen. It is more, it is an item that is gifted.\
  \ It is incredible being brought to and getting to learn. Nothing more than itself,\
  \ beauty from start to finish. The culture has shown me, I, Shantelle Tello that\
  \ you are one and there is more to see. Truly seeing the differences through the\
  \ humans eyes and falling in love. Monday morning, of the month of June of 2018,\
  \ it all begun. Adventurous looking for flights through the safari web, planning\
  \ the picture perfect trip. Hostals searching, rental car looking. Mindshare, was\
  \ brought when I booked my flight and took off. Locals were apart of the special\
  \ take off known in history. Mindless flight, flight attendant attending the role\
  \ call. Throughput at stops in the United Kingdom. Founded in the airports of Australia,\
  \ with a sign that singled out the others. The grateful driver, apears to be welcoming.\
  \ Drives through Australia in the time frame of two hours. Arrived and jaw dropping\
  \ so for sure that my impressions were jumping. Keeping it up, filing the details\
  \ in a small brown journal. Loving the viewing room, windows all three walls. Rain\
  \ coming down and setting the mood. Bed comfortable that it has made me sink in\
  \ deeply. Low lights, relaxing music playing. The ink glinding on paper that has\
  \ been recycled, organic lifestyle. Beginning with the date of the start day of\
  \ the summer. Contrasting with the origin of my hometown, comparing the day with\
  \ other days. Thoughts separating on paper and called. Nature\u2019s perfect offer\
  \ for the human eyes, green landscape. The greens were justified by the way they\
  \ were parked. The soundtrack of the night long-standing was outstanding. The movement\
  \ of the trees uprooted the world. Glazing and photographing the beauty in the universe.\
  \ Continuing, on to the next few mornings as a set stone lifestyle. Waking up and\
  \ falling asleep in the comfort of the days. Touring around Australia, Sydney, as\
  \ a significant other. Photos and videos being able to deliver on social media.\
  \ Laying on sand that multiple days we\u2019re passed and looked over. Hunger upon\
  \ the human body, given \nas a long terminology. Trading in the same day food to\
  \ a wrap of Sydney, Australia food. Teaming with significant others for their work\
  \ course, pleased. After day and night for two months of a lifelong journey, the\
  \ knowledgeable brain cells were being awoken. Eventful,events completed by the\
  \ hours passing."
