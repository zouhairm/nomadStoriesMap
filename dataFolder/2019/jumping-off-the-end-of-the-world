Text: "My niece and I stood at The End of the World, an infamous diving cliff near\
  \ Kualanui Point, just outside Kona, Hawaii. Far below us the ravenous Pacific roiled\
  \ and crashed against jutting tumbles of boulder. Charcoal clouds cast shadows over\
  \ the sky. Salt wind whipped our hair in our faces.\n\u201CAuntie Kimm, I want to\
  \ jump!\u201D Kaley yelled.\n\tOf course she did.\nWhen she was small, my sister\u2019\
  s youngest girl was the one whose pink tennies inched closest to balcony edges,\
  \ who leaned farthest over the aardvark enclosure at the zoo, who skipped with the\
  \ most obliviousness over the slick stones of a mountain stream. She was always\
  \ recovering from some accident or another; she could go, without thought or warning,\
  \ in any direction whatsoever. When our two families went on outings together, even\
  \ though there were six wiggly kids, including my own, it was always the jacket\
  \ loop at the back of Kaley\u2019s neck I kept hold of.\n\u201CWhat do you think?\u201D\
  \ she said.\nShe had managed to stay alive until the age of 18. To celebrate that,\
  \ and as a companion for our daughter, who was a year younger, my husband and I\
  \ had brought her along on this trip. I looked down at the black waves smashing\
  \ into white shards far below. Kaley was now a legal adult; I couldn\u2019t really\
  \ stop her. What was more to the point, she had undressed as she spoke and was now\
  \ wearing only a bikini and a towel. There was no jacket loop I could grab. \n\u201C\
  I think if I lose you off the end of the world your mom will kill me.\u201D \nTo\
  \ get here we\u2019d driven until we were sure we were lost. Wound down a narrow\
  \ road etched over swaths of hardened lava so lean it looked as if wind had blown\
  \ itself here and solidified. Screeched to a stop in a puff of gravel parking lot,\
  \ then climbed over razor sharp boulders until there were no more to climb. Ahead\
  \ of us now was absolutely nothing but the sea. I stood, at an end and a beginning,\
  \ and imagining I could see the curve of the earth. \n\tTo our right, on a flat\
  \ rock jutting out over the plunge, stood a darkly muscled young man. He glanced\
  \ back towards a group of others who stood shivering, waiting their turn. He gathered\
  \ himself, he leapt. Arms pointed skyward, then curved in a parabolic arc downwards,\
  \ and with a silent sluice the ocean swallowed him. Waves crashed against rock,\
  \ recoiled and then smashed again into more incoming waves. After an age a dark\
  \ head popped up. The young man whipped wet hair from his eyes and began climbing\
  \ back up.\n\u201CGo ask that guy for pointers,\u201D I said. \nThe drop at The\
  \ End of the World is, I learned later, only about 35 feet high, which looked plenty\
  \ high enough at the time, but is not actually what makes it risky. The surf is\
  \ unpredictable, often simply too high, and there is no easy way to climb out and\
  \ up. The spot is unsanctioned and considered dangerous. Several people, mainly\
  \ tourists, drown or are injured there every year. \nI didn\u2019t know any of that\
  \ then. I knew that my niece had become an expert swimmer and lifeguarded at the\
  \ city pool every summer. I knew that, unlike when she was small and leaping thoughtlessly\
  \ onto horses and off moving subway cars, she had asked, if not my approval, at\
  \ least my advice. This was new. \n \u201CHe says it\u2019s a good time,\u201D she\
  \ said, coming back from consulting the dripping diver and his buddies. \u201CThey\
  \ come here a lot. The waves aren\u2019t too high. He can jump again and then wait\
  \ down there for me to go after. He says just jump out as far as I can.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Just jump, eh?\u201D I said. But she wasn\u2019t. She was thinking first. Considering\
  \ the risks, taking reasonable precautions. And only then jumping off the cliff,\
  \ into adulthood.\nI smiled, and she grinned back and tossed me her towel."
