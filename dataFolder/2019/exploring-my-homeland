Text: "We arrived in St.John's,Newfoundland early Sunday morning. We considered the\
  \ amount of time we slept on the planes to be enough sleep as we were already behind\
  \ in our adventure. We picked up our rental car and headed to my friend's apartment.\
  \ A couple of hours later my brother came and picked the 3 of us up. My brother\
  \ took us around the city and showed us a couple of cool hiking spots. My brother\
  \ loves hiking and being outdoors so it was a great way to start our vacation. We\
  \ explored all over the city for about 5 hours before heading back to my friends\
  \ place. Although it was a Sunday, me, Pascal and a couple of my high school friends\
  \ headed to George Street that night to find a place that would screech Pascal in.\
  \ For any of you who don't know what it means to get \"screeched in\", it is a Newfoundland\
  \ tradition that anyone from outside of Newfoundland can partake in. It varies slightly\
  \ depending on who conducts the ceremony for you but for the full ceremony you eat\
  \ newfie steak (bologna), eat seal penis (vienna sausages), drink screech (a newfie\
  \ rum), repeat some newfie sayings and kiss a cod (yes, the fish). After checking\
  \ a couple of bars we finally found someone who was willing to do it and that night\
  \ Pascal became an honorary Newfoundlander.\n\nThe next day we continued on to Gros\
  \ Morne National Park. Gros Morne mountain is the second highest peak in Newfoundland,\
  \ at 806m. After a long 4-5 hours of hiking up a rocky mountain side, we finally\
  \ made it to the top and we were not disappointed. It was everything I remembered\
  \ it being, maybe even windier. We decided to camp on the side on the mountain on\
  \ our way down and spend the night. When we woke up the next morning, we were greeted\
  \ by a moose outside our tent. He was very peaceful and watched us before walking\
  \ up the mountain (and making it look like hiking that mountain was a joke).  We\
  \ started our descent down the mountain to make it to our scheduled ziplining in\
  \ time. I had done the ziplining the year before but the views were so beautiful\
  \ I could zipline the same lines every year and never get bored. It is a series\
  \ of 9 lines that take you back and forth over a waterfall. Anyone who knows me\
  \ knows that waterfalls are one of my favorite things about nature. It has the highest\
  \ zip-line in Canada which I think is pretty cool in itself.\n\n\_After our ziplining\
  \ adventure, we drove on to Sandbanks Provincial Park. They are known for their\
  \ long, sandy, white beaches. Although I lived in Newfoundland for 18 years, I never\
  \ got the chance to check it out until this trip. Being by the ocean always has\
  \ a way of making me instantly happy. We spent the evening running along the beach\
  \ and chasing the waves. The simplicity in it was what made it one of my favorite\
  \ moments. We spent the night camping there before heading to Baie Verte, my hometown.\n\
  \nWe spent that weekend in Coachman's Cove, where our family cabin is. I don't think\
  \ I really appreciated the cabin and Coachman's Cove when I was growing up. There\
  \ is no cell phone service or internet there so I used to dread going. Now it is\
  \ a blessing. My dad took us out in boat and me, Pascal and my parents spent the\
  \ morning cod jigging. It was Pascal's first time fishing this way and he was blown\
  \ away by the size of the fish. Once we got to shore, my dad taught Pascal how to\
  \ gut and fillet the fish. That evening for supper we had a variety of seafood,\
  \ all delicious. My favorite was definitely the stuffed squid that my aunt made,\
  \ a Newfoundland tradition. \n\n\_I loved growing up here because of how safe I\
  \ felt. Everybody knew everybody. Sure, it can be a pain sometimes when everyone\
  \ knows your personal business as well, but for the most part it was good. It was\
  \ peaceful and my heart will forever be in Newfoundland."
