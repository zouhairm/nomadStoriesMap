Text: "I remember waking up that early morning with plans for the day.  Yesterday,\
  \ I spent the whole day at the farm and today it is still going to be the same.\
  \  We have been able to finish adding compost to the soil; hopefully the rain will\
  \ fall soon so that we can start farming.  Usually there is no internet at the farm;\
  \ therefore I always make sure I wake up early enough so that I can handle my online\
  \ business before going to the farm.  One unread inbox got my attention and I dived\
  \ into it to know the content, surprised it was from the Australia Awards Africa\
  \ with a congratulatory mail that I have been selected for a fully funded short\
  \ course award that will be taking me to Australia, through South Africa and then\
  \ Kenya.  I had to read the mail again to finally comprehend the content, it is\
  \ indeed true what it says, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the\
  \ Australian Government is paying my bills and stipend to attend a short course\
  \ in Australia and Kenya.  The short course was on \u201CIrrigation and Water Resources\
  \ Management for Agriculture\u201D.  I have not travelled outside my country before\
  \ and I have never been on an airplane in my life.  I had to share the mail with\
  \ my family first, everyone was initially sceptical about it, some said things about\
  \ organ harvesting but I have the final decision and I chose to follow it up.  The\
  \ plane journey will make a full novel but after three days on the road and air,\
  \ I arrived in Sydney in the morning.  Another connecting flight took me to Brisbane.\
  \  This is the city were I will be spending 32 days of my life, it started with\
  \ the welcome dinner and there was good food everywhere, the leap into the unknown\
  \ all of a sudden started becoming interesting.  The accommodation was out of the\
  \ world, even after a year of the trip, I will close my eyes and see myself back\
  \ in the room.  Then the exposure to Australia was an opportunity to experience\
  \ Australian culture and way of life including geography and sights of south east\
  \ Queensland, and university life.  A trip to Darling Downs, Queensland where we\
  \ learnt about the University of Queensland Gatton facilities and salinity problems\
  \ at Darbalara farm, including a soil pit assessment where we checked the soil nutrient\
  \ content, at the Ghost Gully  we learnt about the hydroponics systems. I was really\
  \ amazed by the way farming and irrigation is being handled in Australia.  We also\
  \ visited the National Centre for Engineering in Agriculture (NCEA) at the University\
  \ of Southern Queensland, where we were opportune to see new irrigation innovations,\
  \ Irrigation systems and water use efficiency, water dosing, irrigation scheduling\
  \ . A trip to the Sunshine Coast, saw us visiting the Irrigated Pineapple production\
  \ in Peri-urban areas , Sandy Creek Organic Farm, Coochin Creek Framer Coop.  We\
  \ had to travel 400km to Bundaberg to be at the Department of Agriculture and Fisheries\
  \ (DAF) and also to witness the management and irrigation of Macadamias and other\
  \ fruit trees and horticulture, then another 600km travel to Emerald which took\
  \ a whole day  where we visited Government offices and farms in Emerald region and\
  \ we discussed with local agronomists on nutrient management & salinity also met\
  \ with equipment suppliers to discuss their business model and services , we also\
  \ visited the Marathon and Codenwarra irrigated farms (flood & pivot), where we\
  \ discussed about practical water spreading and contour furrowing ,  I will not\
  \ forget to mention the BBQ organised by the McCosker family, my love for good food.\
  \  We later flew back to Brisbane in order to present our work plan on return and\
  \ also prepare to go back home to Africa. I was already itching for my African food\
  \ which I have not seen for over a month now. Then there was the goodbye party and\
  \ everything seems to just happen like that.  Indeed it was a leap, a rare opportunity\
  \ to enhance my skills and knowledge, gained competence and also boost my career.\
  \ Currently back home with the gained skills and knowledge."
