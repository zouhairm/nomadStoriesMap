Text: "After spending some comfortable days enjoying the beauty of Queenstown, I convinced\
  \ myself it was time to experience the classic new Zealander ritual of tying the\
  \ ankles to a rope and jumping more than 40 meters from a bridge. In other words,\
  \ I was about to bungee jump. \nOn the way to my (possible) last living experience,\
  \ I intrigued questioned my friends the reasons the first person ever thought about\
  \ jumping from a high altitude tied only by the ankles. And surprisingly, I found\
  \ the origins of the first bungee jump just around the South Pacific Ocean, where\
  \ I was staying, as part of a centenary ritual. \nAt the Pentecosts Island, in the\
  \ current country of Vanuatu, the men of the Nagho tribe used to tie vine all over\
  \ their feet and jump from trees as proof of their bravery. This ritual got known\
  \ by the world in 1954 when a group of journalists from National Geographic produced\
  \ the documentary \u201CLand Divers\u201D. From that on, bungee jumping became a\
  \ sport and started to be commercialized. The first commercial one was introduced\
  \ by A.J. Hackett, which as well as the men from the Nagho tribe, proved his bravery\
  \ by jumping from the Eiffel Tower in 1987. And it was his bungee that I had the\
  \ opportunity to jump from. \nStanding on the top of the Kawarau Bridge, staring\
  \ the same named river, I was in the exact position as many others who craved for\
  \ a moment of adrenaline. The horizon was wide and felt endless. Under my body,\
  \ only rocks, water, and a little lifeboat with the staff responsible for untying\
  \ me. Behind, a bunch of people screaming \u201CJump, jump, jump!\u201D just waiting\
  \ for me to give one step more. And after the \u201C1, 2, 3\u201D countdown I shook\
  \ my body to infinity.  \nDuring those long 10 seconds, I had the opportunity to\
  \ appreciate the landscape from a completely new perspective. The rocky cliffs all\
  \ around me were so far, even though I thought I could touch them. The river dancing\
  \ along its way was cold as ice, and I could confirm it because the rope was a bit\
  \ too long for my height and I had this shivering experience of touching the top\
  \ of my head on the water. From the distance, I could see the green shrubs, or Kawarau,\
  \ in the language of the M\u0101ori people, outlining the scenery. And for a moment\
  \ I felt like a bird. But not any bird. A Kiwi bird, the flightless bird native\
  \ to New Zealand, unable to spread my wings and fly towards the clouds.\nHeld on\
  \ my ankles by a single rope, I had a lapse on my mind of those old cartoons in\
  \ which they depicted the people of countries on the other side of the globe as\
  \ they were upside down. Far away from home and living such a different reality,\
  \ I wondered if the inverted world would be here or there. \nI came back to myself\
  \ as soon as the bungee jump staff screamed: \u201CHold the stick!\u201D, in a reference\
  \ to the security equipment. Shaking in adrenaline, I was lead to a lifeboat, where\
  \ they untied me while chit-chatting about some random stuff I can\u2019t remember\
  \ now. Already on safe land, I felt like one of those Nagho men, with the same bravery\
  \ as someone who could not be held anymore."
