Text: "This wasn\u2019t my first solo adventure, but it was my first time in Barcelona.\
  \ It was a toss-up between Barcelona and Madrid, but it was the beach that drew\
  \ me. To my shock, I later found out that the sand had been imported from Egypt.\
  \ However I quickly got over the news, as I continued my journey in this new land.\
  \ \n\nBarcelona wasn\u2019t meant to be a \u2018chill\u2019 holiday. I wanted experience\
  \ and adventure so I intentionally stayed in a hostel, instead of the usual comforts\
  \ of a fancy hotel.\n\n\nAfternoon \n\nThe Cheetah Girls 2 movie, a favourite of\
  \ my childhood, had been filmed in Barcelona, and an iconic scene was filmed in\
  \ Park G\xFCell. Four friends singing and dancing, in front of a beautiful backdrop\
  \ dreaming of boys and romance. Park G\xFCell was definitely on the \u2018must-see\u2019\
  \ list. \n\nHowever procrastination caused a delay in ticket booking.\n\nThankfully\
  \ in the hostel I met Michelle, a lovely lady from Singapore. She was proactive.\
  \ Exactly the same age as me, we quickly became friends. For the next few days we\
  \ would look out for each other. A blessing.\n\nWould it live up to expectations?\n\
  \nSomehow I was running late. On the bus the old people didn\u2019t smile much.\
  \ They had wrinkly and weathered faces; you could tell they had lived well in the\
  \ sun. The little ones were bright and chirpy. I enjoyed the sweet sound of Spanish,\
  \ but it had been a while since I\u2019d heard it so concentrated. There was also\
  \ the new, strange sound of Catalan, spoken with pride and boldness.\n\nWinding\
  \ slowly uphill, so many people packed into this tiny bus. Although I\u2019d noticed,\
  \ personal space wasn\u2019t really a \u2018thing\u2019 for the tactile Spaniards.\
  \ Everyone huddled together like it was nothing.\n\n\u2018How and when am I going\
  \ to get off this bus? Please can you step on it driver!\u2019\n\nI nearly missed\
  \ my stop, but fortunately made it to Michelle just in time.\n\nPark G\xFCell felt\
  \ like a secret 1920\u2019s palace, filled with roaring decorated stones. Lost in\
  \ a beautiful fantasy land, I tried to imagine what was going on in Gaudi\u2019\
  s mind, as he dreamt of this wondrous creation. \n\nJewel coloured mosaics of blues,\
  \ yellows, greens and more - we had to take photos by the Iguana de Escalera.\n\n\
  There were times when we seperated, strolling and taking photos: some to treasure,\
  \ and others to share on Instagram!\n\n\nLunch \n\nMichelle and I noticed a seemingly\
  \ popular seafood restaurant by the beach. I thought I\u2019d try their Paella (I\
  \ know such a touristy option). But this was a different kind. Not the typical yellow\
  \ rice, sprinkled with prawns and vegetables - like in the magazines.  No. This\
  \ was brown and murky coloured. Thick rice in a fragrant stew, with some unknown\
  \ sea creatures. Rich and flavourful; it tasted traditional. Maybe it wasn\u2019\
  t actually \u2018paella\u2019; they tricked me.\n\nIt was a huge bowl, that had\
  \ to be shared. The waiter desperately tried to upsell more options, and whilst\
  \ I was tempted, there was only so much we could eat.\n\n\nNight\n\nA large group\
  \ of us from the hostel, were ready for a night out in Barcelona.\n\nTo start we\
  \ went to a laid back, yet surprisingly fancy cocktail bar, in the Eixample neighbourhood.\
  \ The drinks were strong and pretty. The bartender was either Latin American or\
  \ Asian, or both perhaps? Beautifully tanned, and covered in artistic, semi-tribal\
  \ tattoos- he had a lovely smile.\n\nFinally we reached the club. The music was\
  \ kind of trash. A Euro-pop, EDM mashup. But what happens when the music isn\u2019\
  t your vibe, but you want to stay and have a good time anyway? You make it a cardio\
  \ night! \n\nYou could tell there were people with money in the club. And the glossy\
  \ floor and tables suited them. But it wasn\u2019t pretentious. I just thought it\
  \ was cool that this place was on the beach. \n\nIt was a nice club, as clubs go.\
  \ A simple place for recreation. A whole squad of us, dancing and happy, strangers\
  \ yet friends.\n\n\nMorning\n\nIt was already the next day. A shared taxi back,\
  \ then back to bed. To sleep, rest, recover and reflect, on a new lifetime memory."
