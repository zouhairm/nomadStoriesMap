Text: I left for exploring the northern part of my country the state of Himachal Pradesh
  touristy but most of it was and is on a lot of scales one of the most untouched
  part of India which was alien to me in more ways than one I never saw snow nor I
  have experienced the shrill beauty of nature the extent of which I couldn't have
  actually imagined till I saw it with my own eyes. as I was entering my destination
  in bus driving up the rolling hills I could see the snow-capped peaks which reflected
  the suns rays and was glowing like a crown I was just awestruck by it, to say the
  least as I settled down in Shimla I went down from my hotel to buy some refreshments
  it was the first time I felt such cold in my life it was totally foreign to me the
  beauty the untouched nature I didn't have it down south I thought I was in an alien
  country but I realized that the scenes might be alien and foreign but when I met
  and made friends with the people of Shimla I knew the first time I talked to a local
  I felt I was in India the people  the way they talked, the way the suggest things
  the way they handle daily mundane stuff I knew this was my home too they were just
  like people back home  spent the first day like a kid left out to explore the mountains
  I trekked where I felt like going where there were no path nor any restrictions
  I never really explored stuff that way everywhere I went there were huge peaks surrounding
  me which is a feeling that I never felt back home everything was flat  if I was
  surrounded it was by buildings. that night  as I drove through those hills from
  one hill to another it was totally strange in theory I was going from one block
  to another while, in reality, I was going from one hill to another that's how people
  live there on top of those hills it anything but practical I guess my fundamental
  philosophy was very much different there were no street lights but when I looked
  out the window I knew my route as there were lights like stars on those hills I
  was guessing which cluster of stars would google guide me to.the next day I set
  out to a small hamlet in the Himalayas called kasol as I reached kasol it was raining
  heavily spent the night in my tent shivering with cold I took a nap . when i woke
  up and came out of tent it was cold and i could feel speck  of warmth from the rising
  sun under which was one big snow cover peak having that glowing effect due to sun  on
  its both sides were lush green i couldn't believe that calm serene beauty of the
  nature that sense of lushness you get from seeing some breathtaking views still
  can't shrug off that feeling took my water bottle left my campsite followed the
  river which was just beside my campsite taking in all the view drank some water
  from the river that was so pure which is a dream back home the river in my city
  is highly polluted and if you may we can call it dead then  found a bridge crossed
  the bridge went to the other side of the river  some school kids were on their way
  to school talked with them told them I was from south they didn't know where I was
  from anyway they were small houses filled with people like you find anywhere in
  India. some locals offered me some tea traced my way beside the river till i reached
  a hot spring which i didn't knew existed in India they were in a gurudwara a holy
  place where Sikhs come to pray I knew the traditions inside the temple as I went
  to many of them before I was spiritual and like best thing in any gurudwara anywhere
  in the world they offer free Punjabi food which is a synonym to delicious food  .
