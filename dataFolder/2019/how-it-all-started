Text: "I got cold feet. I know this feeling and I don\u2019t like it. You know, when\
  \ you have been fantasizing about something for so long that the idea of it becomes\
  \ more pleasant than the reality. Now that it is real, I started to consider all\
  \ the things that might go wrong and all the creative ways I can find to ruin it,\
  \ because I know at some point I will. \n\nSo here we are. What choice do I have\
  \ now since I\u2019ve already told everyone about it? I can abandon the project,\
  \ do nothing, choose the easy way out and make up some bullshit excuse for my cowardice;\
  \ or I can go for it, keep failing but carry on until I manage to get somewhere.\
  \ The first thought that crossed my mind when I walked into the van was: \n\n\u201C\
  How the f*** am I supposed to turn this huge piece of rusty metal into a home?\"\
  \n\nI watched hours of tutorials on Youtube, read a couple of books on van conversion\
  \ and even learned all the theory\u2026 and that\u2019s the problem: it\u2019s only\
  \ theory. It may seem easy to some people, but for a lazy-ass like me who\u2019\
  s never gotten his hands dirty that is an immense task involving lots of knowledge,\
  \ practical skills and hard work, none of which I have.\n\nA bit of background on\
  \ this adventure. I\u2019m a digital nomad, meaning I can do my job anywhere in\
  \ the world as long as there is a decent internet connection. There is also this\
  \ huge movement called #vanlife where people post the best 5 minutes of their day\
  \ on Instagram: breathtaking pictures of wonderful scenery, things we all long for.\n\
  \nThe issue is that they only show the tip of the iceberg. And when a large number\
  \ of people do it, as a spectator you believe that every day will be like that:\
  \ purple sunsets, white sand beaches, crystal clear waters and so on. I am a dreamer,\
  \ someone who sees the 10% of good and jumps in head first. I saw magic in the van\
  \ life and decided to give it a shot.\n\nI have to be honest though, there is a\
  \ flip side to the story. I wanted to use this crazy adventure as bait to get back\
  \ someone I lost. I fell in love for the first time at 27 years old, with a charming,\
  \ wild and funny French horse trainer, Eloise. She was witty, smart and never took\
  \ herself too seriously, a happy soul. The kind of person with whom you can never\
  \ be bored, that makes a four-hour date feels like ten minutes.\n\nWe lived a passionate\
  \ and short love story that I managed to ruin by being too selfish (duuuh!). Even\
  \ though we broke up, we kept talking as \u201Cfriends\u201D for about two years.\
  \ I was fooling myself and living in the past emotionally, secretly hoping I could\
  \ get her back somehow...not a good thing. So last summer, I decided to grow some\
  \ balls and tell her I still had feelings for her. In my head, it could go two possible\
  \ ways:\n\n\u2022\tA (5% chance): She feels the same and is ready to kick some life\
  \ back into our dead relationship. I would then move to Paris and try not to make\
  \ the same mistake again.\n\n\u2022\tB (95% chance): She moved on and I need to\
  \ heal. I would live the van life for a while and go explore the Americas; get distracted\
  \ enough to forget about her. Maybe even write a book!\n\nIt is strange how when\
  \ we are exposed to danger, imaginary or real, our body tries to prevent us from\
  \ being harmed. I thought I would record myself before calling her, just in case.\
  \ It was painful to hear, just like the intro of Lose yourself: \u201Cpalms are\
  \ sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy\u201D and this was only the practice session!\
  \ After rehearsing for a while, I managed to phrase my feelings without choking.\
  \ I called her. She did not pick up; I was relieved. There is still hope. \n\nLater\
  \ that day, I rang her again and she picked up...heavy breathing. That was it, the\
  \ moment of truth."
