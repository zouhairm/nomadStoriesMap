Text: "As most people are tucked in warmly under their duvets and probably enjoying\
  \ their fourth dream, I am braving the chilly Nairobi wind. My neck dissolves into\
  \ my body and my hands find refuge in my jacket sleeves. I am determined for the\
  \ wind not to meet any part of my skin. The whistling wind from the trees and cars\
  \ driving by are the only sounds registered that early in the morning. The dark\
  \ sky seduces the moon and undresses it to offer scant light before its brighter\
  \ cousin, the morning sun, would soon replace it. I stand next to a street light.\
  \ My shadow, silent as it is, tries its best to keep me company as I wait for the\
  \ others to arrive. \n\n\u201CThese guys said 5 am, surely!\u201D The cold infects\
  \ me with impatience as I am running out of distractions. I arrive on time. No,\
  \ I arrive early to avoid being on time but am remiss to the infamous \u2018Kenyan\u2019\
  \ time the others subscribe to. I check my phone and it is 5:08 am. If I was Japanese\
  \ (famous for their pedantic punctuality), now would be the time to turn as red\
  \ as a ripe tomato and simmer with polite anger! What more can I do? I just have\
  \ to wait.\n\nThere are very few people pacing up and down the lonely road. Most\
  \ of the activity occurs across the street in the Supreme Court parking lot. Vendors\
  \ defy the morning cold and dark to set up for the weekly Maasai Market. In a few\
  \ hours, sunrise will pierce through the dark of dawn and intense bargaining exchanges\
  \ will evict the current silence. Splashes of colour will emerge as vendors display\
  \ their ornate wares, African printed clothes and bags. On Saturdays, it is always\
  \ buzzing with activity as locals and foreigners stream in and disperse into the\
  \ various rows of stalls.\n\nThe gate entrance of Reinsurance Plaza is where I seek\
  \ my refuge from the cold and boredom. A tall, lanky security guard clad in navy\
  \ blue uniform squeezes himself and keeps warm inside a wooden booth. After noticing\
  \ me, he steps out and makes his way in a slow but assertive stride. I assure him\
  \ I am not staying long and am waiting for friends. He assures me he was just following\
  \ protocol, doing his job and ensuring I wasn\u2019t being \u201Cidle\u201D.  It\u2019\
  s a Kenyan \u2018offense\u2019 I\u2019ve failed to understand and appreciate. How\
  \ is being \u2018idle\u2019 a crime? Our conversation is curt but peppered with\
  \ banter and jokes. He returns to his booth when the cold becomes too much. \n\n\
  I entertain a dose of pessimism and figure if anything were to happen my cries for\
  \ help would not take long to reach him. Lately, theft has returned to Nairobi CBD\
  \ making citizens uneasy and unusually alert. An innocent elderly man and his shadow\
  \ appear very suspicious under the Nairobi moonlight and dim street lights. \n\n\
  If the soles of my shoes were dipped in paint and the pavement a canvas, my nervous\
  \ steps would have produced an abstract art masterpiece likely to be mistaken for\
  \ a Matisse or a Basquiat. \n\nBack to my lonesome, I resign to my thoughts and\
  \ hear footsteps approaching me.\n\n\u201CRay? Sema? Pole\u2026we\u2019re late!\u201D\
  \ (Ray! Hi! Sorry, we\u2019re late!) I hear a familiar voice."
