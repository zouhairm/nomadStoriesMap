Text: "You have never done this. \n\nFirst times are so exciting and scary! That\u2019\
  s your first time not just for one but for two things: it\u2019s the first time\
  \ you travel alone and it\u2019s the first time you will go just by foot (for who\
  \ knows how many kilometers). The plan is to start form Turin, the city you live,\
  \ and travel along the Via Francigena. Just like the Camino de Santiago (also known\
  \ as the Way of Saint James) that\u2019s an ancient pilgrimage route and it connected\
  \ Canterbury to Rome. You\u2019re not religious or anything, it\u2019s just that\
  \ you wanted an adventure to test yourself and there was this one right nearby.\
  \ Today you have to do 20 kilometers and arrive to Chivasso, your final stop will\
  \ be Vercelli: the city where some months from now you\u2019ll start university.\
  \ You\u2019re taking it as a sort of symbolic \u201Crite of passage\u201D.\n\nYou\
  \ don\u2019t know if you\u2019ll be able to do it but for no reason you\u2019ll\
  \ back down.\n\nYou prepare your backpack, put your walking shoes and just when\
  \ you step out of your home, the journey begins! First you have to walk through\
  \ the city centre and it\u2019s really incredible how the simple act of traveling\
  \ changes completely the perspective you have on the city you have known for your\
  \ entire life. You notice things you never thought were there and appreciate again\
  \ the beauty and the elegant atmosphere of Turin. You cross the bridge that goes\
  \ over the Po river and you start to coast it: for a long stretch it will be your\
  \ companion. It is not the most beautiful of rivers, it has that green-mixed-to-grey\
  \ color of pollution, but its nostalgic majesty and its gentle sound are the perfect\
  \ background.\n\nOne of the reasons that pushed you to take this journey was to\
  \ have time and space to think. And now you\u2019re able to do just that! As buildings\
  \ are replaced by trees and the road composition changes from cement to gravel your\
  \ mind wanders to new places. When you\u2019r struck by a particularly interesting\
  \ thought you immediately write it down. In this manner the first hours slide peacefully.\
  \ You pass by some small villages where the people look at you with curiosity. You\
  \ also exchange a few words with an energetic old man has done the Via Francigena\
  \ before. When you have done 10 kilometers, half of your scheduled trip for today,\
  \ you rest a bit to eat while looking at the countryside.\n\nIt\u2019s when you\
  \ start down the second half that things go south.\n\nAt first it\u2019s just a\
  \ little annoyance at your sole\u2019s foot but gradually it grows in an unbearable\
  \ pain. Later you\u2019ll learn that you had done too much: if your not used to\
  \ walk for long stretches you should do a maximum of 10 kilometers and then increase\
  \ gradually. By the time you do 15 kilometers every step feels like a nail is struck\
  \ in your foot and you\u2019re waking on it. You\u2019re obliged to rest every one\
  \ hundred steps and take off your shoes to have a little bit of relief. And every\
  \ time it requires an immense willpower to put them on again. The last kilometers\
  \ really are tremendous. If at the start of the journey your mind was wandering\
  \ freely, now it is trapped by the pain and the thought to finally get to the destination.\
  \ You\u2019re not able to appreciate the beauty of the landscape anymore, you just\
  \ see more annoying obstacles between you and Chivasso. \n\nBut you don\u2019t allow\
  \ yourself to give up.\n\nThe joy you feel when you finally get to the gates of\
  \ the city is maybe a little excessive but certainly deserved. Luckily you can be\
  \ hosted by some family friends for the night. You\u2019re almost unable to walk:\
  \ do you consider it a failure? Not at all! You have made your leap into the unknown,\
  \ and some troubles are part of the fun! Tomorrow you\u2019ll rest, and then you\u2019\
  ll resume your journey more conscious and prepared than before."
