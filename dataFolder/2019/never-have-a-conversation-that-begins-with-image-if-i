Text: "Hard to believe that it has been five years since the unexpected conversation\
  \ that most definitely help shape my future up until this point. It was February\
  \ 2014, I was three months from college graduation, and sitting in another tedious\
  \ advertising class. Advertising definitely pulled the short straw on the list of\
  \ my favorite classes. It not only began at 1pm on Friday, causing me to be late\
  \ for 3pm lacrosse practice, but it also had the glorious ability of putting me\
  \ to sleep almost immediately. However, walking into class today I noticed a cute\
  \ blonde sitting in my seat. She looked familiar and it wasn\u2019t until I walked\
  \ over and sat next to her that I remembered meeting her the previous year. Katherine\
  \ was the sister of a girl my buddy was dating, and she attended my school the previous\
  \ year before dropping out. Our previous meeting was brief and non rememberable,\
  \ but I was intrigued enough by her to begin asking what she was doing in class.\
  \ She proceeded to tell me that she was just sitting in class because she was contemplating\
  \ coming back to school. Now for my real question\u2026 why did you drop out? To\
  \ my amazement she started telling me a story about how the idea of traveling to\
  \ Africa just popped into her head one day, and she decided to just go for it. Amazing,\
  \ I thought to myself, to just up and leave to another country by yourself just\
  \ blew my mind. Up until that point the farthest I\u2019d been from home was a nice\
  \ little resort in Mexico where I was surrounded by family. \n\tFast forward six\
  \ months and I am now a full time employee at Sarbari Technologies, a software company\
  \ that designs applications for the restaurant industry. I am sitting at my desk\
  \ eating lunch when all of a sudden an advertisement pops up on my Facebook. \u201C\
  Live with Lions in Africa\u201D, I clicked the link and read about a volunteer trip\
  \ to South Africa where you\u2019d spend two weeks helping a lion conservation take\
  \ care of their big cats. I sat there for a moment and immediately thought back\
  \ to advertising class and that girl brave enough to venture off to Africa on her\
  \ own. It\u2019s a sign I thought, I have to do it. I signed up and three months\
  \ later I was on a plane to South Africa. \n\tThe first week of my trip was a blast,\
  \ spending time with the animals and meeting new friends was amazing. However, the\
  \ second week is when my life changed in a big way! Georgia arrived on Monday which\
  \ was the beginning of my second week of the trip. She was a gorgeous girl from\
  \ England, accent and all, and she immediately grabbed my interest. The feeling\
  \ was mutual and by the end of the week it was harder saying goodbye to her than\
  \ I ever thought possible. I returned home, and we immediately made plans to see\
  \ each other again. George is English but she lived in New Zealand, so off I went\
  \ spending a month with her where we explored New Zealand together. We spent the\
  \ next two years traveling the world; England, France, New Zealand, South Africa,\
  \ and all over the USA. Our relationship became so serious that she planned to move\
  \ to the United States, so we could start a life together. Unfortunately, what I\
  \ thought was a passion for her I learned was more a passion for travel, and we\
  \ parted ways as friends. \nTake chances, do things that others think is crazy,\
  \ live a life without regret, and never give an opportunity the ability to come\
  \ up in a future conversation directly after, \u201Cimage if\u201D. Since George\
  \ I\u2019ve been all over the world. Next month I\u2019ll be going to Malta then\
  \ Everest. If Katherine was never in that advertising class, or if Georgia never\
  \ made it to South Africa maybe I\u2019d still be in search of my passion, or not\
  \ know it existed. Never take an opportunity for granted, and certainly never take\
  \ people for granted because you never know who will step in your path and change\
  \ your life for the better."
