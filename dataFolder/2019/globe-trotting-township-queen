Text: "I don't expect to find that beyond the dusty streets of my location, there\
  \ would be more. I didn't expect to find out that beyond the sunset, there was something\
  \ beautiful. I didn't expect to find out that, beyond my area, you could learn more\
  \ just by being exposed. It was exciting and my nerves wouldn't let me sleep the\
  \ night before.\n\nI woke up with an expectation of this new area I wanted to see\
  \ my whole life. I'd heard of it before... But this time, I would be seeing it with\
  \ my own two eyes. Sitting on the she of my bedside, I realized that actually, I\
  \ have made one of my dreams a reality. \n\nI was all packed up and ready to go\
  \ to my favourite place in the world, the airport. There so much you see and learn\
  \ there! Years that resemble the last goodbye after ten years of friendship, the\
  \ warmth of a hug from the arrival of a grandchild, who has never see their kokwane\
  \ (gran in the Tsonga language) and most of all the nerves of a young black girl\
  \ going on an 18 hour flight, to realising her passion for arts at UCLA.\n\nI look\
  \ in awe and take it all in, this is the one place that connects people from all\
  \ over the world in one place. I wait anxiously for what's next, curious as to what\
  \ I will find on the other side. Could it be my destiny? I ask myself. \n\nI take\
  \ a deep breath and close my eyes for a minute, trying to take it all in. Next thing\
  \ I know... I'm fastened on my seat and ready to become little Dora the explorer.\
  \ I thought no I've always loved the thrill of travelling, new spaces and new languages.\
  \ I mean what else would I need other than that and a couple of a thousand Rand's\
  \ to make it a reality.\n\nEasy right? Well, No way's!!! I'm broke and exhausted\
  \ and have a wild imagination. Okay, back to it. The plane is ready for take off\
  \ and boy oh boy... I'm holding to my seat tightly, just in case something happens!\
  \ Funny enough, when you're black, this is what happens all the time! Atleast for\
  \ me. We are off the surface of the earth and soaring in the blue skies like an\
  \ eagle.\n\nI overlook what's beneath me, and the higher we go, the smaller it becomes.\
  \ I mark off the difference on land and water and try see if I can spot my house\
  \ in the screen in front of me, by constantly zooming in! I then realise that I'm\
  \ far away from my every day struggles and ready to Bea whole new person, even if\
  \ it's just for two weeks.\n\nI'm excited to learn the cultures of this country,\
  \ ready to be directed by the wind to an area full of diversity, as much as home.\
  \ I'm ready to be a master of learning, so that I have tons to share on my WhatsApp\
  \ and Instagram accounts. I get a taste of the food in the new country I'm about\
  \ to explore, and I immediately fall in love. It's something familiar and tastes\
  \ really good... After eating I look at the flight attendant and ask her for seconds.\
  \ (I mean who serves up great food in small portions right?!!!)\n\nTen minutes till\
  \ landing they say... Then 5 minutes and then down we go! Personally, I hate those\
  \ because they are scary. All of a sudden I became aware of this new place I'm in...\
  \ I unlock my phone and become really ready to take a few snaps! I'm joyful and\
  \ tell the person to me how excited I am... I'm finally here.\n\nA beautiful young\
  \ girl working in emigration looks at me with the most beautiful smile and says\
  \ to me: Karibu Sana, welcome to Nairobi..."
