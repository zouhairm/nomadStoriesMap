Text: "\u2018Oh, Luce,\u2019 my host mother sighed when I\u2019d told her I was going\
  \ out to a sushi bar on my third night in Verona. At 21, I wasn\u2019t used to having\
  \ to ask for permission. \n\u2018I don\u2019t think you should go out with the other\
  \ girls,\u2019 she smiled, taking my hand. \u2018They aren\u2019t like you, see,\u2019\
  \ she said \u2013 as though I am some great beacon of virtue and not a young woman\
  \ who could drink the devil under the table. \nValentina spiraled into a long, relentless\
  \ rant about the previous au pairs she had encountered and how I should be very\
  \ careful not to be corrupted by their wicked ways. Especially Americans. Oh, she\
  \ told me all about American girls and how disgustingly fake they are with their\
  \ plastic nails and bleached hair, about how Australians are all immoral atheists,\
  \ and how French girls are bisexual, the lot of them.\nShe whispered this to me\
  \ as I nodded, folded my hands and acrylic nails behind my back, made sure to remove\
  \ my religious views from my social media accounts, and made a mental note to never,\
  \ ever, let on to her that I would actually be very pleased to meet some bisexual\
  \ French girls. Girls are hot.\nBy the second night I felt as though I knew my host\
  \ mother better than anybody I\u2019d ever known in my life \u2013 oh, she could\
  \ talk \u2013 yet I\u2019d never felt more unlike myself. I nodded along to her\
  \ racist comments and faked laughter when she joked about \u2018the gays\u2019.\n\
  Valentina hated tattoos, alcohol, Buddhists (seriously), \u2018fat people\u2019\
  , and told me not to go to Venice because gypsies would push me into the canals\
  \ for a laugh. She had panic buttons in every room of her apartment in case \u2018\
  migrants break in to steal the washing machine\u2019 and wouldn\u2019t let me outside\
  \ after dark because she was convinced that I would get kidnapped, even though they\
  \ lived in the safe city centre. \nI\u2019d gone to Italy to live out a long-held\
  \ dream of sipping wine on warm summer evenings, flirting on balconies, riding around\
  \ the city on the back of a moped and taking shopping trips at the weekends. What\
  \ made it worse is that that is exactly how it was for the other girls in Verona.\
  \ \nThere were 16 of us there, and 15 of them were living like they\u2019d fallen\
  \ into an indie film with golden filters over every frame. I watched them live out\
  \ the life I\u2019d imagined through the green glow of WhatsApp messages. They invited\
  \ me out to Venice to fill their sketchbooks with gondolas, to see if we could spy\
  \ celebrities at fashion week, and even just to get coffee in the shop below my\
  \ apartment, but my host family wouldn\u2019t let me go.\nI\u2019d been so worried\
  \ about adjusting to life abroad that I\u2019d forgotten to value my own independence.\
  \ I\u2019ve lived alone for years, but never travelled alone. I\u2019d never even\
  \ flown before, yet sooner than expected I was capably hauling 30kg of luggage half\
  \ way across the country via so many buses and trains I lost count, just to escape.\n\
  Verona is a beautiful city. On the days I managed to go out, I met incredible people\
  \ on park benches, toured the city, and even took myself for a full dinner in the\
  \ expensive shopping district. I wouldn\u2019t have had the courage to do this if\
  \ I\u2019d had the choice, and I\u2019m so glad I didn\u2019t. I uploaded selfies\
  \ via Gucci Wi-Fi, accidentally got a military escort to Aldi after asking a soldier\
  \ with a rifle for directions, shared ice-cream with a poet, and spent four hours\
  \ talking with an elderly lady from Finland about politics whilst sitting in the\
  \ stalls of a roman arena.\nBut in the end, the negatives of life with my host family\
  \ won. I taught English to their children for 10 hours a day at the weekends, had\
  \ no privacy, and endured hate speech. I sat on the steps of a cathedral in the\
  \ rain purely because I had nowhere to go and felt uncomfortable in their apartment,\
  \ cried in an alcove at a night market, and spent the last of my savings getting\
  \ a flight home.\nI was unlucky with my au pair experience \u2013 most au pairs\
  \ do not end up living with the Italian version of Katie Hopkins, but I\u2019m weirdly\
  \ glad I did. Yes, I came home early. Yes, it wasn\u2019t what I imagined, but whilst\
  \ there I realised that I don\u2019t need anyone to hold my hand. I don\u2019t need\
  \ a host family to look after me. \nI am more independent than I thought. From now\
  \ I\u2019m going it solo."
