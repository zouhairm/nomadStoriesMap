Text: "My eyes looked down on the slim legs and bare feet of two young boys of Urang\
  \ Badui Dalam. These seven-year tiny boys and the adult ones would carry our backpacks\
  \ and logistics for our stay at their village.  They all wore saroong that is half\
  \ folded to their waist so they could move easily. On tops they put on only two\
  \ colors either black or white coarse cotton blouses that their women wave and dye\
  \ naturally.  Another distinguished appearance is the white headdress that they\
  \ wear. \n\nIt was my very first encounter with Urang Badui Dalam, a Sundanese ethnic\
  \ that leads a secluded life in Kanekes village, Lebak District, Banten Province,\
  \ Indonesia.  Following their ancestral belief, Sunda Wiwitan, they have isolated\
  \ themselves from all modernity and superficial and materialistic world.\n\nThey\
  \ have protected their area of living from the outsiders by not constructing any\
  \ access road. In order to reach their residential hamlet, one needs to walk on\
  \ foot for 6 hours. In my case, since my guide is considered a family of Urang Badui\
  \ Dalam we got a shorter distance that took about 2-hour walking. Under the bright\
  \ sky, we exercised our breath on the natural red earth paths. Some were flat, the\
  \ others  were undulating with sharp inclining and declining. But our physical tiredness,\
  \ at the same time, met with natural beauty that entertained our visibility  along\
  \ the way. \nMy sneakers raced with energetic steps of the young boys, who\u2014\
  as I observed, never drank or took anything as we walked.  Despite their small figures,\
  \ their back bones are strong to carry 10 kg backpack. Their bare feet have been\
  \ the friends of the red earth since in their early age. They use to walk bare feet\
  \ from the point to the outside world to their hamlet several times in a day.  When\
  \ twigs blocked our way, they chopped them with the knife that they insert on the\
  \ belt.  \n \nAfter crossing three bamboo bridges over the rivers, we reached Cibeo,\
  \  our destination. It is one of the hamlets of Urang Badui Dalam in Kanekes village.\
  \  Any visitor should keep their electronic gadget as soon as entering  Badui Dalam\
  \ area.  All connection with the outside world was completely removed.\n\nThere\
  \ was a sense of serenity as I was entering the residential area.  The residential\
  \ area is a cluster comprising around 20 stilted houses, which are made of wood\
  \ and bamboo. It is located by the river and is surrounded by a forest.\n\nTheir\
  \ thatched roof houses are neatly arranged on unsymmetrical elevation.  Urang Badui\
  \ Dalam do not change the land  contour when they construct their  houses. The children\
  \ were playing in a small open space in the middle of the cluster. Like the adults,\
  \ they wore unbuttoned clothes knitted by hands. \n\nI was mesmerized with the lifestyle\
  \ of Urang Badui Dalam that does not contaminate the nature.  They do all the washing\
  \ including shitting in the river. Therefore, they split the river area into zones\
  \ where to take water for drinking and to wash.  They use no chemicals at all instead\
  \ they use  the plant leaves as soaps.\n\nWhile I have only read about their lifestyle,\
  \ now I experience myself.  Taking shower in a half-opened site. Surrounding me\
  \ is the trees. Without hesitation, I scooped the water using half-cut coconut shell\
  \ from water container made of a half-cut wood trunk with a big hollow in the middle.\
  \ The fresh cold water is supplied 24 hours from a fountain that is channeled by\
  \ a bamboo trunk.  It was an authentic experience of taking natural shower.\n\n\
  My short stay with Urang Badui Dalam really boosted my awareness how to live simple,\
  \ and how to integrate my life with nature, at least by protecting it instead of\
  \ exploiting or contaminating it."
