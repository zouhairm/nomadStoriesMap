Text: "Sometimes we are attentive to the itineraries that take us out of our state\
  \ or country, and forget that close to us there are unique and unforgettable beauties.\
  \ In 2018, I decided that I would spend my holidays at the end of the year in Galinhos,\
  \ a little place located on the tip of a peninsula, in the state of Rio Grande do\
  \ Norte, Brazil. Right from the start, the untouchable beauty of that place surprised\
  \ me, its land access is formed by beautiful soft dunes of fine and clear sand that\
  \ gains different colors depending on the time of day. Therefore, the only way to\
  \ get in is by boat. Popular buses and cars can\u2019t enter, people leave vehicles\
  \ in the parking lot outside the peninsula, and await their vacancy in the boats\
  \ that constantly transport the residents and tourists who come and leave city.\
  \ One of the most fantastic things is that when taking the boat we can already contemplate\
  \ the beauty of the river navigation and see its encounter with the sea. Beside\
  \ the flora of a mangrove being the cradle of several species of animals that are\
  \ present because that\u2019s where they belong. When descending in the Pier, we\
  \ are greeted by wagons that make the transport in the city, as there are no cars,\
  \ they adopt a silent transport and without pollution and with well-kept animals.\
  \ He perceives the peace that exists in that place, stands out the sounds of nature.\
  \ When we travel, there is always a certain concern if you will give time to visit\
  \ the whole place and see everything it offers. However, Galinhos is a small place\
  \ with a population of only 400 people and exact 500 meters in diameter make in\
  \ a short walk can enjoy the sea bath on one side and river on the other. The dunes\
  \ of Galinhos are simply incredible, in some localities, lagoons are formed between\
  \ them, giving calm to the seawater to take a good bath. In other places you can\
  \ see enormous dunes made of salt, because in nearby municipalities there are large\
  \ industries, and it can be explained by the salty content of seawater being high\
  \ in that region. However, for me the key point of the trip was to see the sunset,\
  \ we walked to the lighthouse at the edge of the city, which has a small size, an\
  \ old red and white design. From there we can have a view of where the peninsula\
  \ ends and in the middle of that sea, to see several wind energy towers to the horizon.\
  \ When the sun began to hide, everything gained a different color, the sea became\
  \ blue, the sand and the sky of orange tones. It was the the most beautiful sun\
  \ I've ever seen in my life, that contemplation for me was very special, lacking\
  \ words to describe. On the walk back, with everything already dark, it was possible\
  \ to see several lights shining on the high seas. It was beautiful and very peculiar,\
  \ when I asked for the locals residents, I discovered that they were platforms of\
  \ oil. When I got to where I was staying, I reflected on how to know that place\
  \ was important to me, because beyond the incomparable beauty, in the present day\
  \ where I see my country having a complete disrespect for nature, destroying it\
  \ to get the most out of it. I got many sometimes thinking that the human being\
  \ would never respect the natural spaces, but that place possesses so many natural\
  \ riches and is linked with the economy in due way. This makes small municipality\
  \ work, as I have been able to enjoy the safety and health system for example, and\
  \ nature being preserved, is currently something very significant. Finally, in this\
  \ my local connection, I finished my happy, enchanting and hopeful journey."
