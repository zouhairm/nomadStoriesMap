Text: "Although April was only around the corner, there was a thick blanket of snow\
  \ on the ground, which only added to the Transylvanian charm and general fairy-tale\
  \ feel of the place. \n\nHaving marvelled at the majestic castles nearby only the\
  \ day before, I\u2019d taken this opportunity to catch a glimpse of beautiful Brasov\
  \ from Mount Tampa, high up above the medieval city below. \n\nIndeed, guidebooks\
  \ and travel blogs repeatedly referred to the stunning panoramic views to be enjoyed\
  \ from this vantage point. However, there were none to be had on this particular\
  \ day, as the low-hanging fog enveloped the city in an eerie shroud-like mist. At\
  \ ground level, it was less pronounced of course, but the cable car ride to the\
  \ hill above felt like an ascension into a different world. Accompanied by a solitary\
  \ member of staff, Brasov slowly disappeared from sight as the cable car trundled\
  \ slowly upwards, making the experience seem even more surreal.\n\nHe pointed to\
  \ what looked like midday on his watch face. \u201CYou are number four, after\u2026\
  \u201D, leading me to believe that I was only the fourth visitor to drop by in the\
  \ previous three and a half hours. Peak season it definitely wasn\u2019t, but that\
  \ was fine by me. \n\nIgnoring the adjacent caf\xE9 after alighting, I was cheerily\
  \ waved on my way and left to my own devices. I headed towards the famous Hollywood-style\
  \ \u2018Brasov\u2019 sign perched on Mount Tampa \u2013 an unmissable landmark that\
  \ can be seen for miles around. \n\nDue to less footfall, the snow was thicker up\
  \ here and crunched tantalisingly underfoot. A path widened ahead, and a sign pointed\
  \ towards the tall lettering that had become such an iconic feature of Brasov. I\
  \ walked the narrow white corridor of earth that crept up behind it, but there was\
  \ nothing to see except the stanchions that supported the six letters; beyond those\
  \ only pea soup fog. Meanwhile, the faint whirr of traffic below was all there was\
  \ to be heard, only adding to an agreeable feeling of detachment and relative isolation.\
  \ \n\nI walked back, lingering here and there to take some photos of my picture-postcard\
  \ like surroundings. It was then I noticed movement in the distance \u2013 ever\
  \ so fleeting, but definitely the presence of something that didn\u2019t appear\
  \ to be shaped like a human being. \n\nTentatively moving towards a clearing, a\
  \ beast of some size appeared in front of me and stood, jaw clenched and head raised.\
  \ Appearing more wolf-like than anything else, it froze, eyeing me curiously. In\
  \ turn I froze, though purely out of fear than some sense of inquisitiveness. \n\
  \nBefore I could decide whether to walk on unperturbed or head back the way I\u2019\
  d came, a man in a heavy coat came into view, grabbing this formidable looking creature\
  \ by the collar and gesturing for me to pass.  With neither of us seemingly familiar\
  \ with each other\u2019s native tongue, I swapped pleasantries and sidled past the\
  \ pair, all the while seeking some kind of reassurance, lest I be mauled and suffer\
  \ a rather unfortunate fate.   \n\nMercifully, there was no mauling and I was able\
  \ to reach the caf\xE9 unhindered, with 15 minutes to spare before the next cable\
  \ car was due to head earthwards again. I used the time wisely, purchasing a local\
  \ beer to sooth any nerves and ingratiate myself with the two locals present. \n\
  \nWorking behind the bar of the caf\xE9, Nicolae spoke fair English and was able\
  \ to answer my queries about the impressive beast I\u2019d just encountered. It\
  \ was actually a Carpathian shepherd dog belonging to his friend \u2013 a breed\
  \ he said was capable of fighting huge bears that roamed the Carpathian mountain\
  \ range. He went on to assure me that their general threat to people was minimal,\
  \ with these particular dogs being incredibly loyal and devoted. \n\nThese words\
  \ and a clinking of glasses brought me both comfort and relief, yet I was truly\
  \ humbled to have encountered this magnificent animal in such a wonderful setting.\
  \ \n\nI was then beckoned towards the waiting cable car and made my descent through\
  \ the mist, all the while vowing to visit Brasov again soon, when visibility was\
  \ a little clearer perhaps."
