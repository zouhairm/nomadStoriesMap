Text: "The spirit yearning \nThe soul bloating \nThe streets yelling my name \nIm\
  \ home floating. \nOn depression.\n\nSeeking to break free \nChained by loss\nCaught\
  \ in the net \nWithout a gross\nThe wages of my love \nWasted in grief\nDigital\
  \ pages \nQuenching on QWERTY \nIm found spilling \nMy spiritual beans in disbelief.\
  \ \n\nMy name is Melikhaya September i live in South Africa in the Eastern Cape\
  \ Province at a small town called King Williams Town in Dimbaza. \nDeep down in\
  \ my heart of hearts im a travel writer by nature i love and enjoy writting poetry\
  \ and music i love traveling along the coastal South Africa as a performance artist.\
  \ I observe the surroundings with a keen eye. I enjoy reading and Currently reading\
  \ Ben okri's \"In Arcadia\", Travel guides and art journals.\n\nIn 1986 i had an\
  \ accident at a very young age where i was burnt by a petrol bomb that left me with\
  \ still visible scars on my face left hand my stomach. That on its own changed the\
  \ pattern of my life and i was in some way kept on a motherly suitcase and brought\
  \ up in a way im still yet to Overstrand. I reflect back on these moments spent\
  \ in hospital with my Mother on my bed site sleeping on a bank stool for weeks on\
  \ end refusing to go home and leave her son behind.\n\nIt was the matters of my\
  \ country. South Africa was on fire in the 80's \nThe air was thick with teer gas,\
  \ burning tires necklaced on people called Impimpi (Traitors working with the police)\
  \ and houses.  \n\nThen there was School time i was culture shocked and habit shook\
  \ like a new window of consciousness was swung open for my mind to see. Children\
  \ don't care and children  don't know like my eyes couldn't see what other children\
  \ saw when looking at me me looking at my self or what id later known knowing my\
  \ self. I was confused an identity paradigm was shifting everyday. \n\nOne day father\
  \ came from work with a cardboard full to the brim with books of different genres\
  \ my life changed. I found refuge i found a way to look through the growing world\
  \ around me a lens that transcends the metaphysical of my own. Throught books i\
  \ was able to travel. To feel how and what others felt..\n\nGood god i started writing..\n\
  \n\"\nHits lands and valleys \nCuts rivers mends them back again giving way to the\
  \ eternal flow of things.\nCircumclimbs mountains noons and moons already envisioning\
  \ the summit it envisioning him. Bumped a cliff at the neck of it \njust for the\
  \ heck of it.\nStill searching for that 'I will never forget' reflection he saw\
  \ on the pool one day.\nA Bird. \nA Great white Bird Flapping Above Him looking\
  \ down at the pool of still waters like the mirror  of reflection \nThe mirror of\
  \ truth. \nThe unclimbed clif at its feet he waited in defeat. \nBeaten.\nLost.\n\
  Weeping.\nLaid in his own stupidity \nHis unequal inequity. \nDying slow last breath\
  \  paused by the white feather falling down the breathtaking  african sunset to\
  \ his faint touch..\""
