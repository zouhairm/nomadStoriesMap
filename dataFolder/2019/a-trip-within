Text: "A Trip Within\n\nThe night was thick with humidity, the pungent smell of fish\
  \ sauce, and the kind of energy that only exists in cities inhabited by millions.\
  \ My boyfriend Chris and I were seated at a street stall soaking in the insanity\
  \ of Khao San Road, the \u201Cbackpacker ghetto\u201D of Bangkok, sipping \u201C\
  pi\xF1a-colada\u201D buckets (filled with a liquor I\u2019m sure wasn\u2019t rum).\
  \ Food hawkers sold barbecued insects, street stands advertised two-for-one liquor\
  \ buckets, and local Thai tuk-tuk drivers made popping noises with their mouths\
  \ to lure travelers to Bangkok\u2019s famous \u201Cping pong\u201D shows. It all\
  \ was a shallow spectacle for the thousands of Western backpackers, excitedly, drunkenly,\
  \ ambling the street. It was one of those places one could disappear in forever,\
  \ as easily as never needing to experience it again. \n\n\u201CBangkok is crazy,\
  \ isn\u2019t it?\u201D a young man said next to us, initiating conversation.\n\u201C\
  It really is,\u201D I agreed. \nWe exchanged the familiar traveler dialogue of where\
  \ we were from and where we were going. His name was Ren\xE9, and he was a veterinarian\
  \ from Chile. His dark wavy hair hung suavely over his kind eyes and relaxed facial\
  \ features. Even though we\u2019d never met, I felt a strange kinship with him.\n\
  He confided to us that this trip was his first time leaving South America, and considered\
  \ himself new to the \u201Cvagabond lifestyle\u201D.\n\u201CWhat made you decide\
  \ to take the plunge?\u201D I curiously inquired.\nHe smiled, and answered, \u201C\
  I had a spiritual awakening. Simple as that. My life revolved around my career.\
  \ With the help of DMT I redefined what I wanted out of life, and now I want to\
  \ help others do the same.\u201D \nI was surprised he was speaking so casually about\
  \ an illegal drug. But honestly, my curiosity was piqued. I\u2019d heard about the\
  \ potent, therapeutic psychoactive from a variety of sources at that time, everything\
  \ from click-bait headlines to peer-reviewed journals. \nRen\xE9 read the thoughts\
  \ wrestling in my mind. \u201CWould you guys like to try some?\u201D He asked playfully.\n\
  Chris and I exchanged skeptical looks.\n\u201CYou mean, you have some? How did you\
  \ get that in Thailand?\u201D I asked, more impressed than put-off. \n\u201CI brought\
  \ it from Chile,\u201D He said with a mischievous grin.\n\nAt that point, the night\
  \ could have unfolded in either of two ways: play it cautious and politely refrain;\
  \ or leap into the unknown, swallow the proverbial red-pill, and say yes. My mother\u2019\
  s worried voice echoed feebly in the back of my mind, encouraging me to make the\
  \ \u201Csensible\u201D choice. Oh well. Curiosity won. Before I knew it our buckets\
  \ were empty and we were en route to Rene\u2019s hotel to smoke DMT. An anxious\
  \ anticipation rose in my chest.\n\nI volunteered first, and was prompted by Ren\xE9\
  \ to lay on the bed. He prepared a pipe with a crystal powder and instructed me\
  \ to inhale, as deeply as I could, and hold it. I closed my eyes and the room melted\
  \ away, with only Ren\xE9\u2019s voice connecting me to the reality I normally resided\
  \ in. My mind spiraled through various images constructed of geometric fractals,\
  \ and presented thoughts in a dream-like manner. An ancient matriarchal figure appeared\
  \ and validated that I was on the right path in life, despite my uncertainties.\
  \ I slowly slipped back into the physical world and allowed myself to orient my\
  \ thoughts. The overall experience felt like hours, but the clock revealed only\
  \ minutes had passed. I sat in silent reflection as Chris went on his personal journey,\
  \ and then Ren\xE9 himself. Outside, Bangkok\u2019s chaos raged; inside was still;\
  \ intimate.\n\nAs we left the hotel room, I felt a sense of tranquility. There was\
  \ an unspoken bond created between us, and I marveled at how our own individual\
  \ experiences coalesced into one united whole. This experience was impossible to\
  \ anticipate, and strangely liberating. Travel isn\u2019t confined to the borders\
  \ of countries, it extends past the deepest corners of our minds; it\u2019s a way\
  \ of thinking: to travel is to passionately embrace the affirmative. To say yes.\
  \ \n\nIn a foreign city, vastly different from my home country, I crossed a frontier\
  \ even more wild, one within myself."
