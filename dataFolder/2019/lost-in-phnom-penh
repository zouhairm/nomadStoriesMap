Text: "It started with a simple beginner's error -first time overseas in South East\
  \ Asia and I forgot to bring the Cambodian translation of our hotel room. My VERY\
  \ experienced at travelling friend/housemate's mistake was to rely on me to get\
  \ us back to the hotel!  This was off the back of nearly three weeks travelling\
  \ Burma without a hiccup!  \n\nNeedless to say, after three hours exploring the\
  \ city, eating lots of delicious local food, buying countless souvenirs and knowing\
  \ we needed to pack and leave early the next day...... we were ready to relax in\
  \ our splurge hotel room!  \n\nTwo hours in a tuk tuk later (our drive in was 20\
  \ minutes max) and we could see our driver steaming with rage. We were completely\
  \ lost, but could tell although we were in the general area, we were driving in\
  \ circles.  \n\nAt about 11pm, in the dark back streets, it appeared we were being\
  \ stranded at a school (our tuk tuk driver had given up).\n\nWe were shuffles into\
  \ a fancy car by some monks previously met when asking directions. \n\nWe THOUGHT\
  \ kidnapping may be a real thing, but as it happens they dropped us home about 30\
  \ seconds later, prayed with us and wished us good night.   \n\nLesson learnt: always\
  \ write your address in the local language.  \n\nRegrets: None!!!"
