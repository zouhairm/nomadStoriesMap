Text: "I couldn\u2019t tell you the exact moment I fell in love with him. I was in\
  \ denial for months, until one day he told me he was seeing someone and I felt like\
  \ I had ran into a brick wall.\n\nHe was one of the first people I met at University.\
  \ I remember thinking how funny and attractive he was, but we seemed to click more\
  \ as friends. We started hanging out in the same group, then began spending time\
  \ together one on one. He would pop round for a coffee and we\u2019d just talk about\
  \ our days, it was a casual friendship to begin with. However as the year went on,\
  \ we started to share more, and soon he was the first person I turned to for advice\
  \ and vice versa. When we said goodbye for Christmas, the thought of not seeing\
  \ him for a month affected me more than I thought it would. Out of all my friends,\
  \ I found saying goodbye to him the hardest.\n\n \n\nBy Christmas I knew I was in\
  \ love with him, but denied it until the beginning of summer when we said goodbye\
  \ again and I cried. Even though we spoke every day, I still missed him. I told\
  \ my friend from home all about him, and although I was aware that when I spoke\
  \ about him I did gush a little, I thought that was because I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ someone as amazing as him was my best friend. When she declared \u2018you\u2019\
  re in love with him\u2019, I laughed her remarks away, but after that I couldn\u2019\
  t help but feel like she was right.\n\nAfter that, I went into denial. I knew I\
  \ was in love with him, but he was my best friend and our friendship was more important\
  \ than my feelings. I\u2019m not proud of how I coped during this time because I\
  \ slept around, thinking that would somehow make me realise it wasn\u2019t true.\
  \ We came back to University and for the first couple of weeks I was so elated to\
  \ be back with him. To see him happy because he had started to see this girl he\
  \ really liked, that I didn\u2019t even realise how much I was hurting.\n\nAfter\
  \ a couple of days crying and feeling confused I decided to tell him the truth.\
  \ It\u2019s the most terrifying thing I\u2019ve ever done. We had a massive argument\
  \ and he denied everything I said. When he was finally convinced that it was real,\
  \ he said he needed time to think about things.\n\nNow we\u2019re back to being\
  \ best friends. He said he was sorry for how he acted, and our friendships is one\
  \ of the most important things to him. Even though I know it\u2019s going to be\
  \ hard, and I\u2019ll probably fall in love with him even more; I just want him\
  \ to be happy. That to me is love- putting another person\u2019s feelings before\
  \ your own."
