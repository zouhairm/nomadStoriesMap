Text: "When you travel, keeping in mind the journey of your, well, mind can be just\
  \ as an intensive and rewarding experience as the world around you that you have\
  \ just found yourself in.\n\nThat's what happened to me last year. I went to England\
  \ to find a purpose. A really far way to go in order to do and and not a cheap one.\
  \ I'd like to imagine that in another version of myself I could connect with somewhere\
  \ closer to me like New Zealand or Singapore, that way my bank account might not\
  \ be drained and my body so exhausted. I went to London, as nearly every Aussie\
  \ person does, to find meaning. I had just been discussing studying abroad for part\
  \ of my degree and felt confident that I could find a uni to undertake. \n\nWhat\
  \ I was not prepared for was two and a bit weeks of crying, confusion and complete\
  \ amazement. I didn't check out any of the units I was planning to see, I barely\
  \ saw any of the landmarks everyone tells you to see, but I remember one day, I\
  \ went to see Windsor castle. I've always had a fascination with old histroical\
  \ bulidings and the people who lived there. I think it's a unique way to feel connected\
  \ to the past. Just walking in the footsteps of people hundreds of years before\
  \ me made me stop suddenly in my tracks. \n\nI had spent the past week, dumbfounded\
  \ by my choices, feeling like I could never find the right time to study there,\
  \ or that I even wanted to study my major there. I didn't want to waste my time\
  \ or my money on something just for the sake of essentially \"getting out of the\
  \ house for a bit\". I was confused about what I really wanted to do. I didn't know,\
  \ and I realised that changing my life to another country wasn't going to change\
  \ that all on its own. I had to decide that for myself, and I stopped in my tracks.\
  \ There were thousands and millions or people before me, who didn't have choice,\
  \ who lived their entire lives in castles, farms single towns and never got to experience\
  \ anything like what I was currently experiencing.\n\nWe live in the age of choice,\
  \ and as a young person trying to figure themselves out this can be overwhelming.\
  \ However, remembering the people before us who had no choice and still some, to\
  \ this day have no choice, we can chose to chose. We can chose our choices, make\
  \ decisions and have the capalticy to achieve our goals. Sometimes the best thing\
  \ to do is to wait and keep trying, untill you find something that speaks to you.\n\
  \nI rushed into my trip to the UK last year, now I have had time to think and breathe\
  \ and I have found my calling, and I will work for as long and hard as it takes\
  \ to get there."
