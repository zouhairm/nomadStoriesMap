Text: "I got a message on Snapchat, seems like this app crushes in Qatar. My friend\
  \ asks, \"I'm excited to go to Qatar National Day. What do you think?\"\nWell, why\
  \ not? In three years coming and going to Qatar, I'm always present on Qatar National\
  \ Day, but I've never been in the events. Two years ago I slept too much and missed\
  \ the time. Last year they had canceled in solidarity with Aleppo during the offensive\
  \ of the Syrian government forces to retake the city of the rebels. This year I\
  \ was prepared! I turned on the alarm to play near the time, I separated the camera\
  \ and I already warned at home: \"I don't have time to return\". Everyone knows\
  \ that the traffic is chaotic by itself, so on an event day things get worse. \n\
  Thinking it wouldn't  be a big deal, I chose to wear a basic outfit. Tennis, pants,\
  \ a white shirt and a red bag to honor the country. When I came across my friend,\
  \ wearing Christian Louboutin heels and an abaya with the colors of the Qatar flag\
  \ (white and red), I was sure. It would be an important event.\nAll that was well\
  \ talked about in social networks. Filters dedicated to the day, messages of love\
  \ to the motherland. I posted a photo with the hashtag #qatarnationalday and it\
  \ wasn't long before five people showed up asking where we were going to be and\
  \ what car we were going with. I don't know how they would differentiate cars, since\
  \ most Qataris drive Land Cruiser. By the way, I would go in one and sarcastically\
  \ I said I would be in a white one. Almost all are.\nWe went in five people. Arriving\
  \ on the main street of the city I could already see the movement. We were in a\
  \ car parede. A salesman came offering flags. We decided to buy the biggest he had.\
  \ Bullshit. We repent. There wasn't enough space in the car for five people and\
  \ a gigantic flag.\n\n- \"What now?\" I ask.\n- \"Now we can climb the sunroof and\
  \ sit up there. I divide my abaya with you. \"\nMy friend was really excited. She\
  \ looked like those kids who are going to win the toy that they begged to receive\
  \ at Christmas.\nThe driver of the round put in the last volume the National Day\
  \ theme song. We went up. I dressed one side of the abaya. \n\nI won't lie. I was\
  \ scared. I felt that wind in my hair and every descent I thought I would fall from\
  \ the top of the car. Children waved, none were afraid to fall. I found out that\
  \ I'm afraid.\nWithin five minutes of the first half, four different cars asked\
  \ to take a picture of us and several others called us the whole time. We were killing\
  \ it, we'd be celebrities the next day, sure.\n- \"Pack the flag!\" A driver shouted.\n\
  It was at this time that I realized that I was committing a huge absurdity instead\
  \ of being devastating as I had imagined. I was sitting on the greatest symbol that\
  \ a country can have. I was sitting on the giant flag.\nABOUT QATAR NATIONAL DAY:\n\
  Qatar National Day is celebrated annually on december 18. This holiday is destined\
  \ to celebrate the historic event of 1878, when Sheikh Jassim, the founder of the\
  \ State of Qatar, succeeded his father, Sheikh Mohammad Bin Thani as Emir. However,\
  \ it was celebrated as Qatar's national day, after 1893 only, when Jassin freed\
  \ Qatar from Turkish influence by winning the Al-Wajbah battle."
