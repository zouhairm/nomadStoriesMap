Text: "The shy mountain was hidden behind a thick grey cotton like clouds that only\
  \ opened around its top, framing it for few minutes, meanwhile I was in the bus\
  \ from Chureito Pagoda towards Oshino Hakkai. The main reason to go to Fujikawaguchiko-Machi\
  \ in November was to see the Mt. Fuji framed by the red autumn leaves of the maples\
  \ trees, the view I was hoping for, was probably more like those great pictures\
  \ that appear in the touristic magazines, however what I got was this quick glimpse\
  \ that I enjoyed and admired from the bus window, it showed its top bathed by the\
  \ sunlight and covered in snow, so smooth that it looked like a big meringue peak.\
  \ \n\nAfter expending the day checking the Mt Fuji World Heritage Tour Bus places,\
  \ I returned to Fujikawaguchiko-Machi, ready to look for a restaurant to get a nice\
  \ dinner. I walked from the bus station towards the shore of the lake, when a rumble\
  \ of drums beating in perfect synchrony, like a thunder, captivated my curiosity,\
  \ where the sound comes from? I knew it was a \"Taiko\" performance and I was determined\
  \ to find the source of it, as what better place to experience it than in Japan.\n\
  \nFollowing the sound through the streets, I found an alley with some food and drinks\
  \ stands leading to a Buddhist Temple called Entsuji Temple. \"Taiko\" has always\
  \ been associated with religious ceremonies or local festivities and is common to\
  \ find them at Shinto Shrines and Buddhist Temples, so I assumed that the sound\
  \ was coming from there.\n\nWith respect I passed the doors of the temple and gather\
  \ close to the public contemplating the drummers and the ceremony in place. I was\
  \ very exited to be able to enjoy the performance and I was wondering what was the\
  \ meaning of it. The drummers were very young, making it even more impressive as\
  \ they beat the drums with such coordination and expertise that showed the hours\
  \ they must past training and perfecting their technique. \n\nThere was a monk wearing\
  \ a white robe with gold and red ornaments, he was standing in from of a bed of\
  \ burning coals and ashes where some red heads of different sizes were burning.\
  \ He seamed to be saying some pray and was making some reverences. From where I\
  \ was standing the monk has behind him a light post which emanating light beams\
  \ surrounded and gave him a magic appearance.\n\nTowards the end of the ceremony,\
  \ people walked in between the bed of coals, ashes and dharma dolls, meanwhile the\
  \ drums keep beating and making the moment so magical and definitely a great cultural\
  \ experience I didn't expected to find.\n\nThere was a stand selling those red heads,\
  \ which are called dharma dolls, they are made of paper mache and the most common\
  \ color is red, which signify victory and success and they represent the ability\
  \ to overcome any set back in order to achieve your dream, is like your reminder\
  \ to never give up your dream. Every year people write a wish into the right eye\
  \ of the doll with black ink, once the wish comes true they fill the left eye, if\
  \ during a year the wish didn't come true, they bring the dharma doll into the temple\
  \ to burn it, as a purification process to set free the \"Kami\", which is the spirit\
  \ inside the dharma doll and as a renewal, that the wish will be preserved in the\
  \ year to come.\n\nThis ceremony in Japan is performed by the monks once per year,\
  \ which make it so special and me so grateful to be in the right place at the right\
  \ time in order to presence it. The Mt. Fuji didn't show to me his full magnificence\
  \ view as all the days I expend in the area were rainy and cloudy, well I will take\
  \ it as an excuse to return back, maybe I will try to frame Mt Fuji with the cherry\
  \ blossoms."
