Text: "Standing, crowded and competing for space in the passport security line amongst\
  \ my fellow plane travellers I stand intimidated and fearful upon my arrival in\
  \ the airport of Gdansk. Awaiting me, a grossly overweight, bearded, bald Polish\
  \ security officer standing between me and my entrance into Poland - at this point\
  \ in time I regretted ever choosing this as a destination to come to. The grossly\
  \ overweight, intimidating security officers first words forcefully asked \"why\
  \ Gdansk? Most people your age have no reason to come here\" - at this point my\
  \ only reasonable and justifiable answer that I had the courage to produce was \"\
  the flights were cheap\". It was at this very moment that that answer was going\
  \ to become so futile and irrelevant beyond what I had ever realised. \n\nI managed\
  \ to pass through security after a rather traumatising and belittling experience\
  \ and myself and three friends stepped into what looked not too dissimilar from\
  \ a London black cab towards our hotel. As we drove in the taxi, the first thing\
  \ that came to my awareness was the open roads, which were not only spacious but\
  \ also extremely clean and well maintained. As we drove into the Old Town where\
  \ our hotel was situated, the buildings beamed with colour and dazzled with their\
  \ intricate architecture, much reminiscent of that of Copenhagen. At the epicentre\
  \ of the town was a canal of which boasted an 18th century ship standing proud and\
  \ elegant for all to see as they crossed the bridge into the town. Beyond the bridge\
  \ was the most magnificently constructed archway of which formed the gateway into\
  \ Gdansk. The street, much like the roads was very wide with buildings of colour\
  \ shining down on each side. Outside the buildings was a plethora of restaurants,\
  \ who's tables and food spilled out into the street, accompanied by extremely welcoming\
  \ waiters. My curiosity made me walk over to a menu to get a feel for what was available\
  \ - what struck me was the fact you could purchase a steak for the equivalent of\
  \ 6 pounds, which to me was unbelievable and only excited me more about the prospects\
  \ of the food I could indulge in on this holiday. \n\nBefore embarking on my adventure\
  \ to Poland, a country of which I had never been enthusiastic to explore before,\
  \ I was warned of its danger and constantly bombarded with the question \"why\"\
  \ - not only with friends and family from the United Kingdom, but even the local\
  \ Polish people. Thankfully, after having visited both Gdansk and Sopot I can give\
  \ a fruitful and meaningful answer to that question. \"Why Poland?\" - of which\
  \ my answer would be the pure allure of the coloured buildings, the wide welcoming\
  \ streets, the extremely amicable people, the rich history and affordability of\
  \ the place, enhanced further by its beautiful broad walk and beach in Sopot make\
  \ it a place everyone should consider and desire to visit. It is a place that defies\
  \ stereotypes and that is what made me so grateful to have disregarded opinions\
  \ and gone to see it myself."
