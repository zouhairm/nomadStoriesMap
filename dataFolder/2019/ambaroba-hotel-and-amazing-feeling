Text: "Ambaroba Hotel that the name of our hotel in Toba Lake. We had that journey\
  \ to full fill our assigment to pass the test. Don't know what we found and with\
  \ whom we met. Excited, worry, and need big courage to join. Cause i am afraid of\
  \ water. Can't swim.\n   Finelly we get that place in save, need three big bussess\
  \ to get all of us go there. Each bus have 3 guardians lecturers. I can't slep well\
  \ in night way. So i keep my eyes opened and listen to the radio. From bus, get\
  \ into boat, and find our big hotel. Each rooms can fit 3/4 people. Sleep for relax\
  \ our muscles in 5 hours journey.\n    The next day we wake up and go to school\
  \ for teaching practice. The angkot take us in time. Until there we met the teachers\
  \ and asked for time to take care their students for 2 days. In 2 days we taught\
  \ them to fill our test and they were happy to gave us that time. Teaching them\
  \ were new for us.\n    Ambaroba hotel has good facilites and nice view, have some\
  \ motorcycle, bicycle to rent. Near from that hotel have banana boats, speed boats.\
  \ We hire it to fun. So exited. Scared to face the deep lake. Danau Toba is famous\
  \ of the beauty and the deepest. Lucky i have some friends to ask me join in banana\
  \ boat. One banana boats can suit 8 peoples. Have safety clothes and the driver\
  \ can make sure me to join. No harm he said. And i never regrats to join. Even i\
  \ feel nervous when the banana falls down to the water to make people on it also\
  \ falls. My face in first time get into water. Shock, only my head can see on the\
  \ surface. My legs were fly, no land to feet. Panic, i reached my friends around\
  \ me. They were shouted \" don't hold like that sis, we get drawn soon, just quite\
  \ there, we will help you soon\". No choice to accept that offer.\n   Not satisfied\
  \ with the moment, i hired a speed boat to ride. The driver stand on in front of\
  \ speed boat and have some action to interest the visitors. He is so amazing, keep\
  \ do this for long time make him so expert. Wow momet i felt. Love this journey.\
  \ \n    We also went to Tomok, so many souvenier and foods that indentic with the\
  \ ectnic. Ofcource we must bring a lot of money there. No bank and ATM over there,\
  \ cash all. Batiks, statue,ulos, salty fish, accesories etc. And have tombs over\
  \ there. The tombs of Batak's king, Si Gale-gale, white sand etc. Not enough one\
  \ day to do all. We only one day to Tomok.\n    I just bought hair bend, my money\
  \ not enough, after rent banana boats, speed boat and bicyckle. I need buy souvenir\
  \ food for my family. I choose Dodol to bring home. We transit on Bengkel. Bengkel\
  \ is dodol store, so many kinds of dodol. Original, durian, pandan and pineapple.\
  \ I choose original and durian. One bar is 40.000 so i spent 80.000 for two of them.\n\
  \    In way of home, were sang and dance. They were not shy to dance, not ordinary\
  \ dance but funny dance, make us loughting a loud. And when night we stoped for\
  \ a while, find rest rooms,ate, watched tv and chated.\n    Some of friends were\
  \ find their love in this moment. I am happy for them. Best moment to find your\
  \ soulmate. I have best moment to find stranger there. We take some pictures and\
  \ sharing phone numbers.\n    My family were happy with my food seveniour. Tasty\
  \ and fresh. I hope i can back again with my family someday. To feel again the fresh\
  \ air, water, boats etc.  I sugest if you want cheap travel just prepare your food\
  \ on bags. And maps to guide your directions. \n   I have dream can travel to another\
  \ country and document it. With some photos and video. Amazing to travel and meet\
  \ new people, find the beautiful place, foods, habit and etc. When my dreams becomes\
  \ true. I will glad to get travel scholarship, and prepare all that i need."
