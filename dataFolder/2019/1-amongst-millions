Text: "The hot Indonesian air stuck to my entire body, head to toe, as I trudged through\
  \ the airport with my giant luggage bag. Ngurah Rai International Airport was swarmed\
  \ with cab drivers shouting and holding signs for their parties to arrive. My friends\
  \ and I are overwhelmed as we are caught in the middle of the oddly organized chaos.\
  \ We find our cab driver, Dony, who was our tour guide for the weekend as well.\
  \ We spot him and call his name, attempting to shout over the many people surrounding\
  \ him. He spots us out of the corner of his eye. Climbing out from the sea of people\
  \ standing around baggage claim, we were greeted with hugs and cold water bottles.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHi all, my name is Dony! Pleasure to meet you,\u201D he said with a\
  \ smile while walking us to his van in the parking lot. \n\n\tWe pile into his car\
  \ with our bags and drive off to our hotel. Dony was a 20-year-old born and raised\
  \ Indonesian who had more energy than a 6-year-old after having sugar. He told us\
  \ every fact he knew about Bali and mentioned all the places he has taken tourists\
  \ in the past. He even told us more information about the areas we wanted to travel\
  \ to. A 30 minute drive felt like 5 minutes with Dony. We paid him for the first\
  \ of many trips and said we would see him tomorrow for our drive to see the famous\
  \ rice fields and monkey forest.\n\n\u201CSee you tomorrow, friends! 8:30 in the\
  \ morning, bright and early!\u201D Dony waved goodbye and got into his car.\n\n\
  I thought about Dony and his kindness as we checked into the hotel. We knew him\
  \ for less than an hour and he already called us his friends. In a country where\
  \ we didn\u2019t know anyone and felt so small, it was nice knowing one person who\
  \ was so outgoing.\n\n* * * \n\nAs he learned more about us, he opened up to us\
  \ about his family and friends and he showed us pictures of his journey\u2019s throughout\
  \ the years. He told us about his likes and dislikes. He even told us about every\
  \ tattoo he had including this new one he wants to get that he\u2019s been drawing.\
  \ Everywhere that we traveled that weekend, Dony came with us. At first, he was\
  \ hesitant about intruding on our activities and meals. We told him that he wasn\u2019\
  t our tour guide that weekend, but he was our friend we were going to experience\
  \ Bali with. Meals, tourist activities, and car rides were spent with him. Dony\
  \ took us to secret areas only the locals knew about, like a hidden waterfall or\
  \ a restaurant amongst the forest that looked over a beautiful rice field. We were\
  \ so lucky to have Dony with us. \n\nOn our last morning, we were picked up before\
  \ sunrise for our drive to the airport. We got into his van and we reminisced on\
  \ our weekend, talking about our favorite meals we had and sights we saw. We arrive\
  \ at the airport and ask him how much we owe for the ride. He looks at us and shakes\
  \ his head and seems confused. \n\n\u201CPicking you up from airport was me doing\
  \ my job. But dropping you off at airport is me saying goodbye to lifelong friends.\
  \ Dony won\u2019t accept,\u201D he says.\n\n\tWe look at him and tell him how much\
  \ he deserves to be paid for everything he has done for us. We say our goodbyes\
  \ and when he wasn\u2019t looking, we throw a well deserved $100 in his car. We\
  \ figured that could go into his new tattoo he told us about."
