Text: "I love Chinese food, in particular dumplings, so I\u2019m always on the hunt\
  \ for the juiciest xiaolongbao parcel or the softest pork bun pillow; ladies and\
  \ gents I think I\u2019ve found the holy grail of authentic Chinese food.\n\nChinatown\
  \ Noodle Restaurant is a hole in the wall, found in Haymarket and is one of Sydney\u2019\
  s hidden gems. However, I\u2019m sure when you visit this establishment, you\u2019\
  ll immediately think, \u2018I don\u2019t think this is the place.\u2019\n\nLeave\
  \ your first impressions at the door because what you see and what you taste is\
  \ unparalleled, even though you can\u2019t help but wonder what on earth you\u2019\
  ve gotten yourself into. \n\nYou\u2019ll be seated at a cramped table, your elbows\
  \ touching your neighbours. Be ready to raise your voice as at times you\u2019ll\
  \ be shouting over the chefs in the kitchen banging the noodles against their benches.\
  \ Your interactions with staff can be questionable at times, often wondering if\
  \ you understand each other, but let me tell you the food is heavenly!\n\nNow before\
  \ we continue, in the vicinity there is Chinese Noodle House, Chinese Noodle Restaurant\
  \ and several other combinations of Chinese + Noodle + Establishment name. Chinatown\
  \ Noodle Restaurant is opposite Woolworths on Quay St before you hit Thomas Lane,\
  \ not to be mistaken with the venue with the same name on the actual corner- clear\
  \ as mud, right?\n\nThe food is cheap and it\u2019s easy to imagine this is how\
  \ locals dine back home in China. No fuss, just good food, the way dining should\
  \ be! If it\u2019s your first time visiting, I\u2019d ask your waitress for their\
  \ recommendations, as they usually point out items you didn\u2019t even realise\
  \ were on the menu. Otherwise, if you want my advice, you cannot go past the lamb\
  \ and onion dumplings or the steamed pork buns.\n\nThe dumplings are fresh, steam-filled\
  \ pockets goodness, infused with spice and flavour, and the pork buns are fluffy\
  \ cloudlike pillows, filled with a gooey saucy centre.\n\nLooking for something\
  \ a little different? Check out the beef and shallot pancake. A northern Chinese\
  \ snack that is not at all what you\u2019ll expect, as the pancake resembles more\
  \ noodle than a pancake.\n\nAfter eating here, it\u2019ll be tough to justify paying\
  \ loads for Chinese again because you can easily eat for two people here under $50!\
  \ Best of all its BYO so make sure you remember to bring a bottle of wine- I\u2019\
  d go for a Riesling if I were you."
