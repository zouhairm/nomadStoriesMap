Text: "As I sat, uncomfortably on the suitcase perched against a beam of the shed\
  \ we were asked to wait under, I looked around, trying desperately to memorise every\
  \ detail of the place that had turned out to be such an unexpected haven. \n\nFour\
  \ weeks prior, I had landed in Victoria Falls, an impulsive decision fed by a hunkering\
  \ desire to escape reality. Fraught and claustrophobic, seemingly trapped in my\
  \ own skin, I had scoured the Internet, until I found a volunteering program deep\
  \ within the heart of Africa. Less than a month later, I had arrived. \n\nThe unbearable\
  \ heat, the music from gravel crunching under heavy boots, lips cracked and bleeding\
  \ regardless of how ferociously you applied chap stick, it had all become so comforting.\
  \ The symphony of howls and cries emanating from animals mere metres away from the\
  \ gates that kept them at bay, the natural alarm they had become for me at the crack\
  \ of every dawn, it all seemed almost habitual. Faint as it was, I could hear the\
  \ pitter-patter of Delta\u2019s footsteps. The only child of the Head Ranger, she\
  \ was the first person I met upon entering the reservation. Red hair, like a halo\
  \ around her head, perpetually barefoot, my Little Cheetah as I liked to call her,\
  \ was an unpredictably feisty six year old who had me wrapped around her dainty\
  \ fingers. One look at her and everyone would agree that she truly was the daughter\
  \ of the wild. \n\nHer gift of guinea fowl feathers lay tucked in the pocket of\
  \ my handbag, next to the hairband gifted to me by Ekwefi, a young girl at the school\
  \ we aided by helping build classrooms. Wordless, she would hold my hand regardless\
  \ of what chore I did and would not let go until it was time for me to depart for\
  \ the day. Even though her farewell too had been silent, the embrace we had shared\
  \ was anything but. \n\nTapping my foot against the cracked pavement, I looked at\
  \ the boys sandwiching me. My indomitable pillars, the two had become my fast friends.\
  \ There was nothing we hadn\u2019t done together, almost as though the three of\
  \ us were tied at the waist by some invisible magnetic force of nature. \n\nBreathless,\
  \ we had run for more than a mile when we got too close to a wild elephant that\
  \ seemingly had enough of us on our first day on Zimbabwean soil only to have another\
  \ elephant chase us once more on our last day of work. We had leapt off bridges\
  \ with nothing but a sturdy rope tied around our ankles, screaming as we soared\
  \ over eight hundred feet in less than five seconds. Not finding that to be enough,\
  \ we had voluntarily locked ourselves in a cage, submerged in freezing water, surrounded\
  \ by crocodiles, one of which happened to be an albino. \n\nEverywhere I looked,\
  \ I knew I\u2019d find a memory and it was comforting to know, I was taking it all\
  \ with me, on the voyage back. Yes, many had come before us and more would come\
  \ after we had left, but the stark white walls with countless messages scribbled\
  \ on it, stood spectator to it all. Walls that welcomed our own writing as we departed,\
  \ a tiny space, witness to our time spent there, the lessons we learnt and the minute\
  \ ways in which we grew, unaware of it at the time. \n\nNo other place could be\
  \ so unpredictably beautiful. And this journey with its majestic wildlife, passion\
  \ for life and thrill for adventure had unknowingly put me back together.\n\nThe\
  \ tires squealing to a halt jolted me out of the reverie I was immersed in. Inhaling\
  \ the dry, coarse air one more time, trying to remember how it felt, I embarked\
  \ on the trip back with the same two humans I had begun it with. Not only had this\
  \ country filled me with life once more, it had given me the greatest gift of all;\
  \ friendships that would stand the test of time. And with that came a sense of calm\
  \ because I knew regardless of life and its hurdles, I would be fine. We would all\
  \ be just fine."
