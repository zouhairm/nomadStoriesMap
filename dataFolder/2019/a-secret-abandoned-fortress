Text: "There was no doubt about it: I was lost. Mind you, I had expected, indeed planned\
  \ to get lost, so it wasn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. I have found, when traveling,\
  \ that getting lost is the best and fastest way to allow a city\u2019s particular\
  \ veins and synapses to merge with one\u2019s own body\u2019s circulation system.\
  \ I enjoy this process of osmosis.\n\nAs I traversed both the high and low parts\
  \ of Sorrento, memorizing the pastel colors and intricate pathways, I worked up\
  \ a light sweat. I navigated with growing ease and confidence the crowded, mostly\
  \ pedestrian-filled streets in my sundress and sensible shoes. The only thing to\
  \ watch out for was an occasional tiny automobile that whirred past crowds in unbelievable\
  \ abandon.\n\nOn this particular late afternoon, I was alone, my father having stayed\
  \ at our rented villa for a nap. The trip to Italy was his idea. Having chosen an\
  \ unprofitable career path, he worried that I would never travel if left to my own\
  \ devices. So that\u2019s how we ended up in the orange tree capital of the world.\
  \ \n\nSo far, our travels were mostly disaster-free, with the exception of a cancelled\
  \ flight, getting lost twice, and a slight accident trying to park. \n\nEarlier\
  \ in the day, we took a bus to a nearby town called Baia Marigliano. The bus driver,\
  \ I am fairly sure, was drunk, or at least seemed to enjoy the near scrapes with\
  \ death as he weaved in and out of traffic, whistling along the way.\_\n\nWe had\
  \ exerted ourselves hiking a treacherous, downhill climb. We referred to it as \u201C\
  Walk 13,\u201D its title in my father\u2019s guidebook. The entire time I had worried\
  \ my dad\u2019s 6\u20192\u2019\u2019 frame would slip on the rocks, but we managed\
  \ to reach the hidden cove at the bottom. After a light caprese salad and beer for\
  \ lunch, we headed back to our lovely hotel where he laid on the couch waiting to\
  \ drift to sleep, and I set out alone for more wanderings. \n\nSorrento has a buzzing\
  \ energy. I had fun peeking into the shop windows. The fashion here, I assumed,\
  \ was several years ahead of anything I had seen in Minneapolis. I walked the cobblestone\
  \ streets, smelling the french cigarettes of passersby. I weaved in and out of packs\
  \ of tourists. I just love this, I thought: the street musicians, the endless sidewalk\
  \ caf\xE9s, the stylish women with sculpted hair, heels and sport coats, and the\
  \ cute bartenders. \n\nI realized that I was getting hungry. I check my phone to\
  \ see how close it was to the time I should make my way back to the villa. I was\
  \ nearly out of batteries, which meant I should try fo figure out where I was soon,\
  \ or I\u2019d be in real trouble.\n\nI was walking down Via Fuorimura when I saw\
  \ it. I had walked down this particular road several times since our arrival, but\
  \ it had been evening, and didn\u2019t see the view. In the distance, in a deep\
  \ valley below, I saw the most incredible thing I had ever seen. It was like a giant\
  \ castle floating in a cloud of moss. Looking at it, I felt like I was looking through\
  \ a special lens of a camera. Was this real? \n\nI found out later that it wasn\u2019\
  t a castle, but actually a mill that\u2019s long been abandoned since the building\
  \ of the Piazza Tasso, the main square of Sorrento where I stood. The building of\
  \ the square cut the mill off from the ocean in the mid-19th century, and the mill\
  \ was closed for good in the 1940s. \n\nI imagined myself climbing down into that\
  \ green-covered place\u2014 I was transfixed by it. I resolved to visit it each\
  \ day for the remainder of my trip\u2014 just so I could take in its mystical beauty.\
  \ \n\nI imagined there are folks who illegally enter into the valley to explore\
  \ that ruined building\u2019s secret spaces, but I am not that kind of person. For\
  \ me, it will forever be my most favorite architectural structure I\u2019ve never\
  \ actually been inside.  It\u2019s as alive for me as any place I\u2019ve ever been."
