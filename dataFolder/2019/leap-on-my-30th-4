Text: "I travel to experience what the place has to offer. With no plans, no expectations,\
  \ but only one thing in mind to do, to take the leap at 13,000 feet. \n\nArrived\
  \ on the first day of February, I was pretty surprised about the weather. Cool enough\
  \ that i didn\u2019t expect that cold. People misconception about this country is\
  \ a damn hot place all throughout the year. My friend accompanied me with her friend\
  \ that I met for the first time. Been to many places, Burj Al Arab, Alseef, The\
  \ Pointe, and see Atlantis from their Tram.\n\nSecond day, 2nd February. To the\
  \ thing I really wanted to do. All alone that I get so nervous going to spot. Nerves\
  \ are shaking, the feeling is unexplainable. Am I really going to do this? And then\
  \ boom! Get off from the plane 13,000 feet in the sky. Was so happy, I did it! As\
  \ i didn\u2019t know the feeling, cold air through my face, literally face warped\
  \ from free fall. As the parachute was deployed, get to see the beautiful Dubai.\
  \ I cried and can\u2019t express how thankful I am.\n\nThird day. To the country\
  \ capital, Abu Dhabi. I travel by bus. While on the journey, left and right, sands.\
  \ I didn\u2019t feel I am away from my country. Everywhere I go, there are always\
  \ \u201Ckabayan\u201D (people used to call from my country, Philippines). Meet my\
  \ friends I haven\u2019t seen for years. I am blessed! It rains that day! They say\
  \ that rains only happen once or twice per year. We see the Grand Mosque, amazed\
  \ by the architecture, intricates on the wall. Everything was perfect, unique and\
  \ realized this country is rich. Talk and laugh all throughout. Day passed, I need\
  \ to go back to Dubai.\n\nFourth day. To where all beauty lies. Dubai Miracle Garden.\
  \ With my friend friend, now we call each other bes (bestfriend). I didn\u2019t\
  \ expect. In such hot place, how they manage to bloom such beautiful flowers. Took\
  \ photos, eat and laugh. To Global Village afterwards where I got a chance to experience\
  \ a lot of country in one place. Amazed, excited, happy.\n\nFifth day. With bes.\
  \ To Souk Gold. Gold here, gold there and gold everywhere. We just managed to take\
  \ photos. Find a store with kabayan, asking for discount. I didn\u2019t plan to\
  \ get one. But something\u2019s telling me to get one. And not just one, but I got\
  \ 5 pieces! Bes and I laugh, talk, walk and eat most of times. Then, to Desert Safari!\
  \ Dune bashing, camel ride, sunset, belly dancing, foods, firedacing. All in one!\
  \ Went back to the city, another friend I\u2019ve never seen for over 3 years showed\
  \ up. Talk, eat and laugh. Amazing day it was.\n\nSixth day. Early flight going\
  \ back. I felt sad going out of this country. Thankful for the great and amazing\
  \ five days. Thinking of the memories this country gave me. Walk away. Smiling."
