Text: "\u201CWhat\u2019s the meaning of a short encounter with someone you\u2019ll\
  \ never meet again?\u201D A friend asked me on our way back home after drinking\
  \ with some people we just met at a soup sharing event in Istanbul. Her words hit\
  \ my heart. Sometimes I would be afraid of meeting people because I don\u2019t like\
  \ the feeling of missing someone I will never meet again. Looking outside the window,\
  \ the warm street light ran backward along the bus\u2014like all the memories, they\
  \ can never come back again. From that day on, I started trying to find the answer.\
  \ \n\nMet a German boy on the hill of Tbilisi on a warm afternoon. Watching over\
  \ from the centuries-old fortress, Mtkvari river cuts the colorful city into two,\
  \ stretching from the ancient Eurasian crossroads to the modern vibrant part.\n\u201C\
  Where are you from?\u201D His voice broke the silence.\n\u201CI\u2019m from China.\
  \ What about you?\u201D\n\u201CGermany.\u201D He smiled.\n\u201CAre you traveling\
  \ here too?\u201D\n\u201CI work for a German airline. My flight landed in Tbilisi\
  \ this morning. It\u2019s my first time here. I just came out to look around and\
  \ will go back tonight.\u201D\n\nAs an air attendant, he usually flies long distance,\
  \ but every four months he must fly a short distance. This time, he chose Tbilisi,\
  \ the peaceful capital four hours away from Munich.\n\nDoing a job that always travels\
  \ among countries, he must have met so many different passengers with some interesting\
  \ stories. Would there be a time, he was talking with someone from China as well,\
  \ but up in the air?\n\n\"Have you ever flown to China?\"\n\u201CYes, I\u2019ve\
  \ been to Shanghai five times. It\u2019s a nice city, very young. I really like\
  \ the underground shops there. The food in Shanghai is tasty too. Really love the\
  \ dumplings! Every time landing there, I\u2019ll eat some dumplings first. It\u2019\
  s my treat on arrival.\u201D\n\nFlying to China five times, with all the Chinese\
  \ passengers he met, he has found some interesting changes: young people can speak\
  \ better and better English and are more and more open-minded \u2014 they are willing\
  \ to try coffee and wine instead of tea, which is strongly favored by older people.\n\
  \nAfter a short pleasant chat, we set out to continue our own explorations. Thinking\
  \ it is very likely that we would never meet again, a pale of sadness suddenly spread\
  \ in my heart. On my way leaving, I began to think about my day before meeting him:\
  \ I was planning to go to the old capital of Georgia, but because of getting up\
  \ late, I decided to go to Tbilisi again to see the places I haven\u2019t visited;\
  \ on my way to the old town, I suddenly changed my mind to buy the train ticket\
  \ to Yerevan first; coming out from the metro station, a church (church of Metekhi)\
  \ standing on the elevated cliff first caught my attention. Hesitatingly, I decided\
  \ to go up the hill first; getting off the cable car, there\u2019re two paths, one\
  \ leads to the statue, mother of Kartli, one to Castle Narikala, I picked Narikala\u2026\
  \ There\u2019re so many choices waiting for me at every fork, one by one, they eventually\
  \ pointed me to the specific place at the specific time. I believe it was the same\
  \ for him. Multiply all the probabilities of our choices together, it\u2019s a miracle\
  \ that we can meet. Realized how hard it is to meet someone, even if it\u2019s just\
  \ a short encounter, I feel lucky that we can meet, also lucky that at least it\
  \ happened.\n\nOn the way back, I came across him going back to the old town again.\
  \ We smiled at each other.\n\u201CI just went to Metekhi,\u201D He pointed the cross-cupola\
  \ church overlooking Mtkvari river, \u201Clovely church with some weddings going\
  \ on. You can go to have a look.\u201D\nThinking of my last choice that morning\
  \ before going up the hill, I smiled: \u201Csure! I\u2019ll check it out. Have a\
  \ nice flight back later.\u201D"
