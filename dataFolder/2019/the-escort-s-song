Text: "\u201CIN THE WATER!\u201D shouts our Tongan guide.\n\nWith those three words,\
  \ a frantic rush begins. Snorkels and masks get strapped to heads, fins are fitted\
  \ to feet and with a splash, we jump off the side of the boat and into the deep\
  \ blue.\n\nIt is obvious as soon as we enter the water \u2013 the sound vibrates\
  \ throughout my entire body, getting stronger and stronger as I swam towards them.\
  \ It is a song.\n\nThere were three humpback whales surrounding me; the mother,\
  \ her calf and an escort. Mature male escorts often join a mother and calf in the\
  \ clear waters of Tonga to help fend off predators and protect them from danger\
  \ in their tropical nursery from July to November every year. Often, they are out\
  \ of the way, deep below the surface. Sometimes, you don\u2019t even know that they\
  \ are there until they make their presence known.\n\nThis escort, however, wasn\u2019\
  t hiding from anyone. Although when I first entered the water, I couldn\u2019t see\
  \ him; but his song carried through the ocean like an electric shock. With my eyes\
  \ focused on the mum and bub, I swam closer, hearing the melody of the escort\u2019\
  s song rise up from the depths. It wasn\u2019t until I could really feel it pulsing\
  \ through my body that I looked straight down and managed to gasp through my snorkel.\
  \ Beneath me was the escort, visible only by the whites of his tail, singing his\
  \ tune. \n\nThe gentleness of a humpback whale is apparent the moment you enter\
  \ their world; they\u2019re ever conscious of your presence in the water, but also\
  \ very welcoming. As we slowly approached the gentle giants, it was clear that they\
  \ were comfortable sharing their space with us.\n\nThe humpback calf got the confidence\
  \ to swim away from mum and begin to interact with us like a frisky puppy wanting\
  \ to play. His inquisitive nature was apparent as he swam close to us, checking\
  \ us out for the first time. We\u2019d wave our arms through the water, and he\u2019\
  d replicate us by waving back, rolling around and flashing his belly. He moved through\
  \ the turquoise water with the grace of a ballerina but also darted around like\
  \ a toddler unsteady on his feet. The energy that the calves have in the water is\
  \ contagious; their playful spirit is obvious in the way they curiously check you\
  \ out, spinning and twirling just metres from you.\n\nAt one point, he swam so close\
  \ to me that if I\u2019d reached out and given one big kick, I\u2019d have been\
  \ tickling his belly with my fingers. The way he moved, you\u2019d almost expect\
  \ that this was exactly what he wanted me to do. I made eye contact with him, and\
  \ I could see him looking back at me, taking me in and looking me up and down. It\
  \ almost brings me to tears to think of this moment; it was possibly the most incredibly\
  \ special animal encounter I have ever had in my life.\n\nOnce playtime was well\
  \ and truly over, the escort swam up from the depths and with a few big swishes\
  \ of their flukes, the three whales dove deep and gently disappeared into the big\
  \ blue, leaving nothing but a beautiful memory in their wake."
