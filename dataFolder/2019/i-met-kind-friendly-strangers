Text: "I arrived in Singapore a week after my 26th birthday, this was my first ever\
  \ solo trip and the second overseas travel that I had over the 26 years of my life.\
  \   \n\nAt the Changi Aiport MRT station while waiting for the train, I struck up\
  \ a conversation with a Malaysian man who was standing right beside me. \nHe said\
  \ that he visited Singapore often and this time around he was here to visit a relative.\n\
  \n\u201CWhere are you from? Are you here by yourself?\u201D he asked me.\n\n\u201C\
  I\u2019m from Indonesia and yes I\u2019m traveling by myself,\u201D I answered.\n\
  \nThe train finally arrived and both of us entered the car and stood near the door\
  \ while continuing our conversation. He was a bit surprised by the fact that I was\
  \ there by myself, I mentioned that I had never taken an MRT before and he happily\
  \ explained to me about the routes the places in Singapore that I should see.\n\n\
  His station was earlier than mine, we parted goodbyes and he wished me luck for\
  \ my trip. \n\nOn the same day, I spoke to a waiter at the legendary Indian-Muslim\
  \ restaurant Zam Zam where I tried its murtabak. The man first greeted me by saying\
  \ \u201CWelcome to Zam Zam!\u201D and he ushered me to a table on the roadside that\
  \ was facing directly to the popular Masjid Sultan.\n\nHe took note of my order\
  \ and was kindly answering all of my questions about the menu there. After a few\
  \ minutes he came out with my food and told me to enjoy it.\n\nThe murtabak was\
  \ deep fried and stuffed with chicken meat and vegetables, it was served alongside\
  \ pickles drenched in red sauce and small plate of curry sauce.\n\nThe murtabak\
  \ was too much for me to finish it by myself and I only managed to devour half of\
  \ it. As I was about to leave the friendly waiter came back and asked me why I didn't\
  \ finish my food and with regret I told him that I was full already.\n\nI could\
  \ tell by his face that he was a bit sad by answer but nonetheless he smiled at\
  \ me and said that I should come back another time and tried other dishes.\n\nThis\
  \ encounter-with-a-stranger happened to me quite a few times and it was what I found\
  \ to be the most memorable thing throughout this journey.\nBefore departing to Singapore\
  \ I had my own doubts about traveling solo, especially as a female I was raised\
  \ with the belief that it\u2019s a tough world out there for women and walking alone\
  \ at night is never okay let alone solo traveling.\n\nAnd yet this trip to Singapore\
  \ shattered all of those preconceived notions, this whole journey taught me about\
  \ myself, it opened up my eyes to different cultures and ways of life and most of\
  \ all I met people that made me see the world differently now."
