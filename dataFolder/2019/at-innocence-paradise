Text: "In a bursting summer in India month of May I traveled Nepal which is low budgeting\
  \ country, with a question, 'How Innocence they are?'\n\nWhen i Travel always make\
  \ an abstract with hypothetical question following a small research. Since my childhood\
  \ I have been listening story of Nepal as Innocence Paradise. Thanks to the time\
  \ I got an opportunity to visit from a sponsor.  My flight landed in the mid-noon\
  \ suddenly I felt very happy that I relieved from Bursting Heat of India. Nepal\
  \ climate is moderate in Summer, no Fan needed.\n\nAs I checked out airport, group\
  \ of taxi drivers surrounded me with their quotation to to Kalanki Hotel, 500, 600,\
  \ 700 NRS, but i saw an old man was just quite. I was motivated by him and said,\
  \ 'Uncle, what is your price!'  He replied with 300. I was excited with the offer\
  \ and immediately booked. On the way I asked why he charged so less. He replied,\
  \ 'Kalanki is only 2 miles Sir, this is only legal fare. I only take which is correct,\
  \ why I should exploit foreign tourist. These new youths learned cheating nowadays.'\n\
  \n   I was really impressed by him because a white cloth among 100 of black clothes\
  \ highlights truth. The same way an innocence old man kept aloft the pride of paradise\
  \ aloft. I reached hotel, paid him 100 bucks extra out of my pleasure.\n\n That\
  \ evening I visited Swyambhu temple, the famous Buddhist Tomb in world at top of\
  \ hill. I saw a very beautiful beggar girl. I thought why she was not working as\
  \ she fit and fine. I hesitated to give her any pie not to encourage beggary. I\
  \ roamed in temple two hours till night approached. I observed that she earned enough\
  \ then with that money she bought bread packets in a good quantity then reached\
  \ at down of temple. I was astounded seeing around 50 of stray dogs with number\
  \ of puppies surrounded, some lactating and some pregnant, She fed them all her\
  \ earning.\n\nI felt sorry for my bad opinion and very cordially said, 'Sister,\
  \ you spent all your income on stray dogs!'\n'Brother' she replied, 'I can work\
  \ for my self but these innocent dogs can't. For me begging is work these creatures.'\
  \ \n\nThe reply enhanced my vision of humanity. 'How innocence the girl is untouched\
  \ by practicality of life but truly she is leading great life,' i too think now.\
  \ I donated her 1000 bucks and saying namstey joining palms gone back hotel with\
  \ beautiful memory.\n  The Nepal trip has given very beautiful memories and proved\
  \ my hypothesis 'Yes, it is innocence paradise!'"
