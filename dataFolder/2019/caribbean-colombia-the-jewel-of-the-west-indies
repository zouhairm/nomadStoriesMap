Text: "Most solo travellers have their apprehensions prior to travel, and I was certainly\
  \ no exception. It\u2019s just a short 27 hour hop from Manchester to Cartagena;\
  \ a real tale of planes, trains and automobiles. After avidly watching 3 series\
  \ of Narcos, I had plenty of time to contemplate, \u2018what on earth are you doing,\
  \ heading to a country synonymous for drug lords, civil war and abhorrent tales\
  \ of violence\u2019, oh and not to forget, all by myself! But something enticed\
  \ me to look beyond the bloodshed and chequered past, and boy, am I glad I did.\
  \ \n\nAfter 10 restless hours hurtling across the Atlantic at 36,000 ft, we began\
  \ approach. Arriving in the dead of night, the darkness ominously cloaked the world\
  \ outside my window. Thud.  I\u2019d made it; although part of me wished we hadn\u2019\
  t. What have you done? There really is no going back now. \nBefore I knew it, I\
  \ was through arrivals and dashing across the long corridors of a deserted airport\
  \ terminal hopelessly trying to locate the gate to catch my connection to the final\
  \ destination. And there my first interaction with a Colombian occurred. \u2018\
  Help, where\u2019s my plane \u2019, I said frantically, in a strong Spanish accent.\
  \ The novelty of a \u2018gringo\u2019 speaking Spanish with a Castellano accent\
  \ was enough to quickly draw a small crowd of customer service assistants.  They\
  \ would have given me their house if they could. They walked me to my gate, re-assured\
  \ me and proclaimed I was heading for paradise. My anxiety fell from a 10 to an\
  \ 8. Good start. \n\nMy second flight gave me my first glimpse of the Colombian\
  \ landscape. Vast, wild, and mountainous, the highland wilderness of central Colombia\
  \ stretched out as far as the eye could see. A lush paradise blanketed in nothing\
  \ but rich green vegetation.  It was Eden. We descended through towering clouds\
  \ which rose majestically like chimney stacks through the morning sky. Then dead\
  \ ahead through the thick tropical haze came my first view of what was to be my\
  \ home for the next month. Cartagena, a latin manhatton, where high rises hugging\
  \ the shores of the long golden beaches. \n\nThe plane door opened and I was greeted\
  \ by a comforting wall of heat. The air was thick and steamy like a warm bath. And\
  \ then there was the arrival terminal, more akin to a botanical garden than an airport.\
  \ The pungent aroma of flowers lay heavy in the air, and the song of exotic birds\
  \ rang gently in my ears. \u2018It is paradise\u2019, I thought. This pocket of\
  \ tranquillity wasn\u2019t to last, chaos confronted me at the taxi rank. It was\
  \ bedlam. People, cars, and animals everywhere. I found a cab, and off I went into\
  \ the unknown. The fear back again with a vengeance, soon to dissipate as I began\
  \ to take in the unfolding scene. There in the stillness of the morning was Cartagena.\
  \ Busy beaches filling with fishermen, vendors and tourists alike, going about their\
  \ Colombian ways, enjoying the serenity of the symmetrical waves which gently crashed\
  \ on the beaches by the roadside. Tower blocks to the left, the ocean to the right,\
  \ this just didn\u2019t seem right? Is this not Benidorm? \n\nDead ahead, like the\
  \ scene from a Disney film, the old town loomed. Great castle walls stretched for\
  \ miles along the road side and the true essence of Cartagena began to reveal itself.\
  \ The taxi sped through a little arch and it was then that I knew I\u2019d made\
  \ it; Paradise. I had gone through a time warp, I thought. A multitude of colours\
  \ greeted me. Every building, each uniquely shaped, draped in flowers, with balconettes\
  \ and tonnes of character, all with their unique colonial charm. There I found myself\
  \ in the main square dominated by its magical yellow clock. The melody of Latin\
  \ Spanish filled the air. The infectious beat of salsa bellowed out from every corner.\
  \ I was overwhelmed by the rhythm, not just of the music, but of the people too.\
  \  Stalls laid out in the streets brimming with the most unfamiliar fruit I\u2019\
  d ever seen. This was the true Colombia, a rich tranquillity a far cry from the\
  \ tales of Narcos."
