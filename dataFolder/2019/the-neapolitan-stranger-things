Text: "\u201CAre you still in doubt? Naples is a kaleidoscope of bizarre realities,\
  \ all merged into a sourdough tasty Margherita\u201D- Francesco told me after we\
  \ re-emerged from a Neapolitan slum. We were walking through the narrow streets\
  \ of the city centre and chatting about the area, in between bites of our wallet-pizza.\
  \ As I discovered, a wallet pizza is a medium-size round pizza, folded twice as\
  \ if it was a wallet \u2013 which you have as street food. Anyway, before I get\
  \ lost in the sensorial experience of tasting mozzarella and tomato, let\u2019s\
  \ rewind to the moment I met Francesco.\n\nIt was in the archaeological museum,\
  \ where he used to study the Pompeii's mosaics for his thesis on Belle Arti. He\
  \ noticed me looking intensively at the statue of the Venus Callipygian and asked\
  \ me why I was so focused. He must have thought I was living a serious artistic\
  \ debate in my head, while I surprised him with: \u201CI haven\u2019t seen such\
  \ a great butt in hundreds of fitness influencers\u2019 profiles on Instagram. I\
  \ wonder how they stayed so fit in ancient Rome.\u201D He laughed and invited me\
  \ to grab an espresso.\n\nBy that time I was living in Naples for three weeks, working\
  \ in a 3-bedroom hostel by the sea. On a Sunday morning, the owner, signora Maria,\
  \ was cooking Rag\xFA \u2013 thick tomato sauce with meat that takes ages to cook.\
  \ I could smell the basil like it was growing in my nostrils and hear Mrs Maria\
  \ screaming at her husband in their dialect as if she was right in my ear. As sleeping\
  \ was no longer an option, I decided to leave my tiny bed and go meet Francesco.\
  \ \n\nWe were supposed to meet exactly in the middle of Spaccanapoli, this extremely\
  \ long and extremely narrow street that divides Naples in the middle. As we decided\
  \ not to use Google maps, the computation of the exact middle of the street was\
  \ a bit more challenging. I had to ask each and every shop keeper in broken Ita-English,\
  \ which made communication hilarious \u2013 thank God they do use their hands a\
  \ lot. I arrived first, with the disappointment of the late native Neapolitan Francesco,\
  \ who justified himself by saying he was buying me a pastry \u2013 it is always\
  \ about the food!\n\nA bit further down from where we met, there was the entrance\
  \ to the underground \u2013 40 meters deep, rarefied air and porous tuff rock. We\
  \ were entering an ex anti-bomb refuge, and passing by the skulls and bones left\
  \ by the 700th-century plague (which Neapolitans used to adopt and take care of\
  \ believing that the skulls soul would bring them luck). \u201COddly peculiar\u201D\
  \ was ringing in my head as a description for the unbelievable upside-down life\
  \ Naples developed in its underground through the years.\n\nOnce we were back on\
  \ the ground floor, with the sky above our heads, Francesco lead me to the slum\
  \ \u2013 a truly modest urban house, where more people live than what is humanly\
  \ possible. \"Why this house should be interesting?\", I asked once we were inside.\
  \ \u201CCome over. See how this wall is different from the others, doesn\u2019t\
  \ it look more Roman?\u201D. \u201CWell, Italy, Romans, why is this impressing?\u201D\
  \ And at that moment Francesco, with a touch of magic, pushed the bed aside and\
  \ revealed a trapdoor that leads to the ancient Roman theatre, destroyed by a fire\
  \ in the 500th century. We were simultaneously in a poor house and on an archaeological\
  \ site, where the imperator Nerone performed his pretty terrible singing shows!\
  \ What\u2019s singular is that before the municipality discovered that place was\
  \ actually the ancient theatre, the inhabitants were using it as their personal\
  \ cellar! \n\nBeing still disoriented by the teleportation from one century to another\
  \ and the upside down world of the underground, I had to agree with Francesco\u2019\
  s kaleidoscopic theory - \u201CWhen visiting Naples you end up \u2018visiting\u2019\
  \ a way of life, the Neapolitan way of life: chaotic, random, intense. I mean, there\
  \ were people unconsciously living above an ancient Roman theatre until 2003. Can\
  \ you believe it?\"\n\n \"I can - I am from here\", he replied charmingly smiling.\
  \ \"Let's go grab another espresso\"."
