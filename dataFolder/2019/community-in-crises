Text: "I always find it so bittersweet: returning to my home country. As I travel\
  \ through Muldersdrift, past the Cradle of Humankind, a battle commences in my mind\
  \ - between the regret of abandoning such a beautiful nation, and the relief of\
  \ living elsewhere as it crumbles. \nSouth Africa is arguably one of the most beautiful\
  \ countries on the planet. Rich with history, stunning scenes of nature, and a variety\
  \ of diverse cultures, it truly offers a unique and incredible experience. But it\
  \ can also be treacherous \u2013 especially for tourists. Without local contacts,\
  \ who is there tell you not to take public transport? To be more vigilant at traffic\
  \ lights? To never walk alone at night. The desire to visit is constantly rivalled\
  \ by a concern for safety.\n\nDespite all of the country\u2019s political complications,\
  \ though, there remains a very true, strong sense of community. Those that haven\u2019\
  t emigrated elsewhere have formed indestructible bonds built on trust and a mutual\
  \ empathy. My reason for travelling through Muldersdrift stems from this, in fact.\
  \ I was lucky enough to be invited to a beautiful wedding last weekend, where I\
  \ met a Boer family with a myriad of stories to tell. They extended an invitation\
  \ to myself and my family for coffee the following day, and this where we are now\
  \ heading. The drive is littered with safari parks and farms housing all kinds of\
  \ game; times are tough for farmers, who are paid less for their game and constantly\
  \ face the fear of losing their property under unjust circumstances. The family\
  \ we are going to visit are farm owners. Even in times of struggle, locals open\
  \ their hearts and offer their time for strangers. \nPlenty of caves pop up at intervals\
  \ along our journey, with the Cradle of Humankind boasting the most notable network.\
  \ South Africa is renowned for its natural phenomena, and there is no question why.\
  \ \nAs we finally arrive at the farm, the first thing that strikes me is the beauty\
  \ of the area; the sun is setting over a vast, tree-cloaked lake and bathing all\
  \ the wildlife in a calming orange glow. The father of the family greets us at the\
  \ entrance and we walk through the expansive living area (houses tend to be quite\
  \ large due to the amount sparsely-populated area). The son offers each of us something\
  \ to drink as we marvel over the giraffes wandering ever closer to the house. Everything\
  \ seems so surreal here \u2013 like an image straight off a postcard. I am abruptly\
  \ brought out of my daydream and into a conversation about the crime in the local\
  \ area; this is unfortunately a common topic of conversation amongst farmers \u2013\
  \ the worst affected. We continue to discuss the family\u2019s recent personal encounters\
  \ for a while: the father\u2019s near face-to-face collision with a bullet, and\
  \ the future of the children who will likely not be able to develop a strong career\
  \ if they remain. Before I realise it, we have stayed a few hours (having been invited\
  \ for a 30 minute coffee catch-up) and they are making a braai (bbq) for dinner.\
  \ I nudge my family as a signal to leave, and we attempt say our goodbyes, thanking\
  \ them for their kindness and stories. \nAs we get up to go, however, the father\
  \ tells us he has made us food! One of the most remarkable things about South African\
  \ culture is the hospitality of locals. Despite having increasing less and less,\
  \ there is always enough to go round for others \u2013 even strangers."
