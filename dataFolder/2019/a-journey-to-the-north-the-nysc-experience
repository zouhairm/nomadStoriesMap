Text: "\u201CI\u2019m finished! I\u2019m finished!\u201D howled everyone of us, especially\
  \ the ladies. Whoops! We have been stripped of our long nurtured expectations. Had\
  \ we known that the clarion call could spell life this hard, we might have opted\
  \ for an Exemption Letter. We were not briefed that the country harbours an unsafe\
  \ county as this. Had we known all the knowable, we sure would have taken the available\
  \ steps to avert any leap into this harsh unknown. Alas! No escape route anymore!\
  \ \n\nUniversity education finally concluded in Nigeria! \nHere comes the forty\
  \ six year old National Youth Service Corps (NYSC); the unavoidable that landed\
  \ me on the most incomprehensible inter-state voyage. \n\nLeaving my dingy ghetto\
  \ apartment to the garage under the thin layers of that dark early morning, we all\
  \ summoned in a terrain of the world\u2019s \u201Cpyramid of uncertainty.\u201D\
  \ For most of us, that was the first exit beyond our native states, and for many\
  \ other corps members, it was the first entrance into another linguistic zone, where\
  \ our mother tongue, the Igbo language, suffers dominance in the hand of the widely\
  \ spoken Hausa language. \n\nWhile the journey ate deep into the hours of the day,\
  \ we headed into a desolate tract. \u201CIs this still Nigeria?\u201D queried the\
  \ most scared among us. In utmost bewilderment, we watched some dreadful arid regions,\
  \ the herdsmen\u2019s tents, some long-limbed nomads and variously sized cows competing\
  \ for space by the two sides of the deplorable road. \u201CWe are now in the Northern\
  \ Nigeria!\u201D announced a voice from the back. Beyond this, all we could see\
  \ waving at us were bare lands punctuated by perennial plants on whose bodies the\
  \ Northern harsh weather glowed glaringly. At some points, our amazement was \u201C\
  why are there no trace of the cassava plants and palm trees among this vegetation\
  \ blossoming here?\u201D Just when we thought we were finally in-the-know, we ran\
  \ into drays and coaches carrying men, women, goats and in some cases, cows, all\
  \ in one vehicle. \u201CCould these still be Nigerians?\u201D reframed the same\
  \ voice from the back. \n\n\u201CSee Zuma Rock! See Zuma Rock!\u201D excitedly railed\
  \ our driver. On the spot, all of us quickly giraffed through the windows. Being\
  \ the Nigeria\u2019s spectacular tourist attraction whose igneous intrusion reads\
  \ about 725 metres above ground level and 3.1 kilometres in circumference, the Nigerian\
  \ Zuma Rock is twice as high as the Australian Uluru Rock and more than four times\
  \ as high as the NECOM House. Its mystifying view avails the Madalla area of Suleja\
  \ a desirable royal presence. The reason behind the cloudy smoke oozing out of the\
  \ iconic creature remains a mystery to both geologists and us, the corps members.\
  \ At that spot, seeing became believing, as each of us quickly brought out the hundred\
  \ naira note in their possession, just to compare the Zuma Rock faintly drawn therein\
  \ and the Zuma Rock hanging like a haze before our very eyes. It was indeed a wow\
  \ sight. The unknown that dreaded us the most was the fact that the monolith has\
  \ a human face and flames with a scary fire under heavy rain falls. \nFinally, we\
  \ have safely arrived Niger state!\n\nSo terrified at the sight of these two mad\
  \ women, I ran to take refuge in our platoon officer\u2019s wife, Mrs. Ahmed who\
  \ hurriedly ran out with two-edged machete. \u201CWhere are they? Where are they?\u201D\
  \ she queried impatiently. In great astonishment, I stumbled between two opinions:\
  \ \u201CDoes Mrs. Ahmed not see these two naked mad women staring her in the face?\
  \ Or, could these be apparitions seen by only me?\u201D While still ambivalent,\
  \ the three women started exchanging pleasantries. \u201CRachael, meet my Kambari\
  \ friends, Amina and Aisha\u201D said Mrs. Ahmed. I became dumbfounded. It was then\
  \ I knew that I was only swimming in the ocean of the unknown. The little I unraveled\
  \ afterwards was that those \u201Cmad\u201D women hailed from Kambari, a rural community\
  \ in the state who still practises nudity as a culture. \n\nBelieve me; the clearest\
  \ picture we can ever boast of knowing, all through our trip to NYSC orientation\
  \ camp in Niger state can simply be called the unknown. Thank God; it was only a\
  \ leap!"
