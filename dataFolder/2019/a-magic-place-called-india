Text: "Ready and thinking if I will see with my eyes what I used to read on my grandfather\
  \ books the journey started in Delhi, here I discover the majestic art of driving\
  \ in every possible lane without the concern of speed or transport or in sometimes\
  \ a cow , \"please horn\" was written in the back of some urban vehicles so they\
  \ can be aware of the other one, simply stressful and amazing ,Streets are a dress\
  \ with people, sounds, barrels full of spices and flowers, I use to stop at times\
  \ to not lose details of this amazing place.\n\nTwo days later we were on our way\
  \ to Udaipur the transportation was what we called the \"bollybus\" an eccentric\
  \ old bus with Spread Ganeshas, sparkling threads, and velvet seats. The bus stops\
  \ on the roadway just a local market and a place to eat and that was it, literally.\
  \ With a hand in my heart, I can say this was the best place to eat from all the\
  \ places we visit, just incredibly delicious samosas, butter chicken, naan and lassi\
  \ we forgot the long trip and just enjoyed this little place on the road almost\
  \ forgotten and the most special in India.\n\nHoli festival was an explosion! colors,\
  \ music, dance and happiness you can feel overwhelmed at times and drop a few tears\
  \ listening to the chantings as while friends hug each other and say at loud \"\
  Holi hai\" which means \"Happy Holi\" this festival should be recommended as an\
  \ antidepressive therapy, is about to connect leave the moment and being grateful,\
  \ is not about a fancy dinner or fancy party , just a bunch of powder colors thrown\
  \ into the air and to your face at the end you look like a blended rainbow, stiff\
  \ hair, clothes that you will never see again but the fun, oh the fun is worth every\
  \ minute. This festival celebrates the victory of good over evil and spring arriving.\
  \ \n\nGetting up very early to see the most famous proof of eternal love placed\
  \ in Agra the \"Taj Mahal\" its beauty is not questionable is simple perfection\
  \ the calligraphic inscriptions on walls are breathtaking, speechless  admiring\
  \ the creation of a man who was deeply in love of his favorite wife, who promises\
  \ to make something as big as his love to remember her and the happiness she brought\
  \ into his life. \n\nAfter she passed away, his broken heart decided to start with\
  \ his promise and make it real, It passed 20,000 workers and 22 years to finish\
  \ this majestic piece of architectonic art which is a mausoleum. Taj Mahal and its\
  \ symmetry is just a poem made of Marmol, sandstone and precious stones. The stories\
  \ say that even the name is in honor of his beloved wife (Mumtaz-i Mahal), which\
  \ means pearl palace. Seated at sunset watching the Taj everyone was asking \xBF\
  how will it feel that someone loves you in that way? well, that's the power of Taj\
  \ Mahal.\n\nI passed from an exuberant promise of love to Varanasi, where you can\
  \ see love demonstrated in its raw and rustic way, its a different poem but a poem\
  \ indeed. I was at the stairs of Ganges river taking pictures with my camera and\
  \ with all my senses, watching people who lost someone loved getting rid of their\
  \ hair, little plates with flowers and candle as an offer to Ganga, everyone turned\
  \ to see the grey clouds  \"oh they're burning the bodies, and they will throw the\
  \ ashes to Ganga\" \xBFwhy? I asked (Pedro as he called himself told me ) \"Ganga\
  \ is a goddess every Hindu wants to come here at the end of our lives and finish\
  \ the journey and not reincarnate. He saw hundreds of questions in my eyes and then\
  \ he grabs my hand and says \"look, river alive, alive like you, alive like me\"\
  .  Then I understood it wasn't dead what I was watching it was just transition passing\
  \ thru every element fire, water, air, and earth. there's no crying there's no sad\
  \ moment just appreciation and great fullness for the opportunity to have this experience\
  \ of being alive."
