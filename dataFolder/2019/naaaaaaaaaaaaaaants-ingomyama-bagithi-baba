Text: "That\u2019s Zulu for \u201CThere comes a lion,\u201D in case you were wondering\
  \ what the words from Circle of Life actually means! As my first post on my unexpected\
  \ adventures in South Africa, I felt it fitting that it be about the safari. Quoting\
  \ Circle of Life lyrics in the title is about as close as I can get to referring\
  \ to Lion King since I saw every character except the lions. Seriously\u2026I spent\
  \ a month there and I didn\u2019t see a single lion. Other people in my safari group\
  \ did, but they were in a different jeep. Oh well, I am not finished with my African\
  \ experiences by far. I will be back and I will see lions!\n\nI embarked on a 4\
  \ day, 3 night camping safari in the Kruger National Park with African Budget Safaris.\
  \ I had never done anything like this and honestly had no clue what to expect, but\
  \ I decided to take a leap into the unknown yet again, as I have been doing throughout\
  \ the entire month traveling across South Africa. \n\nOne day, there were a few\
  \ elephants crossing the road right in front of us. Cool! Except not cool because\
  \ they are very protective of their young when the young are around. They were.\
  \ The male stopped in the middle of the road, turned towards us and started walking.\
  \ The guide said \u201COkay everyone, stay quiet and still, we are just going to\
  \ wait here and hope he doesn\u2019t charge at us.\u201D The girl in front of me\
  \ ducked her head and let out a faint squeal in terror. Dude it\u2019s an elephant.\
  \ If it\u2019s going to charge, we are all dead. Ducking your head won\u2019t do\
  \ much. Eventually the elephant turned and completed his trek across the road to\
  \ meet his family on their merry way towards the empty water hole. \n\nBefore the\
  \ first game drive, you sign a waiver. That way, if you die, you can\u2019t sue\
  \ them! Standard procedure of course. \u201CHere is a pen so you can sign your life\
  \ away,\u201D the guide said, to which I responded with, \u201CMan if I had a nickel\
  \ for every time I do that, I could travel without working for years!\u201D I know\
  \ that is not comforting to my boyfriend and family. I obviously survived as I am\
  \ writing now. \n\nI was mostly satisfied with my experience. I saw four out of\
  \ five of the Big Five (lion, elephant, buffalo, rhino, and leopard). If you want\
  \ a guarantee that you will see animals, go to a zoo. But don\u2019t go to zoos,\
  \ they are typically terrible for animals. Go on a safari hoping for the best, knowing\
  \ you may need multiple trips to see everything you want! Each day is different.\
  \ Each hour is different. Every second is unknown. Safari guides communicate with\
  \ each other so they have a good idea where the activity is. Unfortunately though,\
  \ though there\u2019s activity at the time Guide A saw something, doesn\u2019t mean\
  \ there will be when Guide B arrives to that exact spot. Go, but don\u2019t expect\
  \ to see anything and you\u2019ll be pleasantly surprised when you do!\n\nSometimes\
  \ you will see only plants during an hour of driving, but then all of a sudden ten\
  \ elephants decide to cross the road in front of you (with the potential of charging),\
  \ a white rhino marks his territory, three hyenas sleep on the side of the road,\
  \ or a leopard feasts on an impala in a tree. If I can guarantee you\u2019ll see\
  \ anything in Kruger, it\u2019s impala. Seriously. So. Many. Impala. It\u2019s entertaining\
  \ to see people on their first game drive get excited when they see impala, as they\
  \ don\u2019t yet realize that they will always see impala. After two drives if anyone\
  \ hears any rustling or sees something running and gets excited, the excitement\
  \ quickly turns into a sigh accompanied by \u201CNope, just more darn impala.\u201D\
  \ They\u2019re delicious to eat as jerky though! Oh don\u2019t give me that\u2026\
  there is no shortage of impala here. And besides, it\u2019s unusual and exotic to\
  \ foreigners so of course I\u2019m going to eat it! Any opportunity to leap into\
  \ the unknown and try something new, I\u2019m your girl!"
