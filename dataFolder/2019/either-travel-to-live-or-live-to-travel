Text: "No one was ready to go with me, so i bought a  tickets for myself and started\
  \ my journey towards Pak-China Border known as the Kunjerab Pass which is one of\
  \  the Highest border crossing on Earth.\n\nI left Islamabad in Evening because\
  \ of the Bus timings, so i was not Happy because i don't like to travel in Night.\
  \ But it was the best timing, because  we crossed the Rushy Cities in Night time.\
  \  \n\nMy first stop was Abbottabad (137 KM from Islamabad), the driver stopped\
  \ the buss at a local restaurant for 1 Hour and started driving again.  After a\
  \ 7 hours of continuous traveling in Dark Night. \n\nI slept and woke up at around\
  \ 14,000 feet high above sea level with the first Sun Shine. The driver stopped\
  \ the bus for a while. We were at \"Babusar Top\", a valley that connects Gilgit\
  \ Baltistan with KpK Province of Pakistan. As i cam out of the bus i saw a huge\
  \ wave of Mountains down in Front of me and they were soo Green. \n\nThat's when\
  \ i realized that the night journey was a better decision as you will get a surprise\
  \ once the beauty begin. Now the actual journey begin. I was fresh to enjoy a full\
  \ day of traveling on the most beautiful Karakoram Highway. So the highway was getting\
  \ beautiful more and more as we headed towards Gilgit. \n\nThe most interesting\
  \ part was that, the bus was full of different people from different cities, so\
  \ we were almost all Strangers to each others. We Arrived at hunza, which was the\
  \ final destination of the bus. \n\nHunza is a valley in the GB Region of Pakistan.\n\
  It was like a beautiful Garden Green in the Bottom and white on top because of Snow.\
  \ I started hicking towards the Baltit Fort which is located at the highest point\
  \ of the valley. It was about an hour of hike and i arrived at the fort. Another\
  \ surprise was waiting for me. I could see the whole Valley like a garrden bed in\
  \ front of me with the most beautiful sunset. I stayed for a while,  ate some local\
  \ food and a cup of tea with Salt instead of sugar in it.  Yes they use Salt in\
  \ Tea. \n\nI stayed at a Low priced hotel, the drive way was covered with grape,\
  \ apple trees and some other fruit trees. Even tough it was cheap,  but a great\
  \ place to stay with a beautiful view from the window.\n\nNext morning i met a man\
  \ with his son,  who were in the same hotel. They were planning to go to Kunjerab,\
  \ so i joined them. \n\nAnother Amaizing Journey was a head. We hired  Car and started\
  \ moving, we stayed at Attaabad Lake,  Passu Glacier, a lot of small towns and valleys\
  \ and at some river Points.  It was a 6 Hours unforgettable Journey with Naturw\
  \ so beautiful that it couldn't be captured with a Camera. \n\nWe Arrived at Kunjerab\
  \ Pass.  There were so many Travelors. The place has turned into a Picnic point.\
  \  \n\nKunjerab Pass is at 16,000 feet above sea level.  It has the highest ATM\
  \ of the world, and it was working of course. It was October and the time when the\
  \ snowfall starts. Kunjerab remains closed from December to April due to heavy Snowfall.\n\
  \nKarakoram is the highest paved highway of the World.\n\nI couldn't make it to\
  \ K2 region due to time shortage,  so i came back to Islamabad by Air the Next day."
