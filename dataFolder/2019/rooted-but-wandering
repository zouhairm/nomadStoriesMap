Text: "\u201CNo rooms available tonight.\u201D Exhausted and hungry, these were not\
  \ the words I had hoped to hear after a two-hour hike through uninhabited jungle.\
  \ The only hostel in Nongriat was full. I had nowhere to stay the night in this\
  \ remote tribal hamlet. I shivered thinking of the large spiders I\u2019d spotted\
  \ on the way down. \u201CAre you looking for place?\u201D a voice interrupted my\
  \ thoughts.\n\nThe girl was small and slight. She\u2019d draped her saree unlike\
  \ anything I\u2019d seen before \u2013 over a white t-shirt and pinned up neatly\
  \ on the side. We looked each other up \u2013 a local Khasi girl and dishevelled\
  \ traveller in need of a bath. \u201CI can give you room,\u201D her smile widened.\
  \ Behind her, two kids played on the porch of the mud home. A man was rolling tobacco\
  \ into his pipe. \u201CI make food too,\u201D she said. The magic word. I nodded\
  \ and smiled, following her into her home. \u201CThank you,\u201D I said. \u201C\
  Santina, my name,\u201D she replied.\n\nThe room was tiny. The bed crammed against\
  \ 3 walls. No fan. A small window allowed enough light to see cobwebs hanging from\
  \ the wooden ceiling. I dropped my bag and turned to see Santina watching. \u201C\
  I take you to bath now,\u201D she said.  \n\nAfter a cup of honeyed tea, we walked\
  \ to the river, she several steps ahead of me on the sloped terrain. Her stride\
  \ effortless. Steady. \u201CHow do you know English so well?\u201D I asked, panting,\
  \ trying to catch up. \u201CMy mother became Christian when they came to our village.\
  \ They teach us,\u201D she said. She meant Christian missionaries who, during the\
  \ colonial period, spread across Indian villages. \n\u201CYou alone? No husband?\u201D\
  \ she asked. \n\u201CI\u2019m not married.\u201D\nShe slowed her pace. \u201CYou\
  \ should soon. Husband is good to have.\u201D \nI stopped in my tracks. \u201CYou\u2019\
  re married?!\u201D\n\u201CYes, you met my children at home.\u201D I had assumed\
  \ they were siblings.\n\u201CWait, how old are you?\u201D I asked. \nShe thought\
  \ for a while. \u201CI think 25. I don\u2019t remember.\u201D She laughed.\n\u201C\
  You look so young!\u201D I said. She laughed more.\n\nWe walked, side by side. She\
  \ spoke of her kids, her fisherman husband and her dreams to build a hotel business.\
  \ We reached the double decker root bridge, famously endemic to this region, woven\
  \ entirely from live banyan tree roots, groomed and tended to by the Khasi tribes.\
  \ I stepped gingerly onto the bridge, caressing the sides. The roots originating\
  \ from one bank laced across the stream, linking with roots from the other end.\
  \ \nWe sat by the banks waiting for the privacy of darkness and solitude. \u201C\
  I will wait away,\u201D Santina said, walking away. In total darkness, I waded in.\
  \ Into the strange sensation of gentle cold water caressing me. I let myself free,\
  \ to float in nature, knowing Santina would keep watch.  \n \nThe next morning,\
  \ I woke up to find a dainty china tea cup placed on the window sill. Sipping the\
  \ tangy lukewarm tea, I walked into the backyard. Santina was peering through smoke\
  \ into a pot, while her daughter scrambled trying to catch a kitten on the loose.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m making poori,\u201D she announced. \nI watched as she conducted\
  \ her daily business, feeding Maggi to hungry travellers and calculating daily profits.\
  \ \u201CFood is my main business. But many people don\u2019t notice this place,\
  \ like you. You walked without seeing here till I called you!\u201D she laughed.\
  \ I went outside, and for the first time noticed the scribbling on the wall. \u201C\
  Santina\u2019s homestay\u201D, it read, almost merged with the mud wall. \n\nThat\
  \ afternoon, using her kids\u2019 crayons we made a small name board using the back\
  \ of a discarded Maggi carton. While we coloured, we spoke. Of my career, my home\
  \ in Chennai, how I travelled thousands of kilometres to visit her home. The sun\
  \ set too soon that night.\n\nAs I packed to leave the next morning, Santina sidled\
  \ up to me. \u201CEveryone who stays here talk to themselves. But you came without\
  \ husband, and you talk to me. That\u2019s good, no?\u201D she laughed. \u201CI\
  \ feel like I have travelled to Chennai too!\u201D \n\nWalking back up, I thought\
  \ \u2013 aren\u2019t we just like the root bridges. Rooted in one place, reaching\
  \ to another."
