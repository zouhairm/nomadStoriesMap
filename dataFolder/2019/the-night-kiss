Text: "I still wonder if we had failed to notice there was no public lighting in Pushkar\
  \ or if it had been one of the frequent power cuts that I had experienced during\
  \ those months in India. They usually happened in the dead of the night, which thus\
  \ far had not made a difference to me in terms of seeing because, usually, I was\
  \ in bed by then.\n\nThis was a different night though. After a few months of traveling\
  \ solo, my friend John, also known as the Rabbit, had joined me for a few days before\
  \ making his way to Delhi, where he had grown up. We got two rooms at a cheap guesthouse,\
  \ which miraculously provided en-suite bathrooms within my meager budget. We then\
  \ took off on a sunset stroll of the town. Pushkar looked lavish, with its blue\
  \ houses languidly dipping their feet into the water, like local women bringing\
  \ offerings to the lake. Taken by the beauty, we walked awhile. It was a torrid\
  \ day, and hardly anyone was outside. \n\nOr, rather, hardly anyone human. During\
  \ our stroll, the Rabbit and I had to wade across herds of the biggest specimen\
  \ of Indian cow I had encountered on my trip. Placid and white, they crowded the\
  \ small town streets, and towered over us as we crossed their path. In a narrow\
  \ alley, the Rabbit and I were forced to U-turn as one of the primeval beasts lounged\
  \ with its imposing body extending from one wall of the lane to the other. \n\n\
  As dusk approached, we celebrated our reunion at a small restaurant on the first\
  \ floor of a turquoise haveli. We lost track of time chatting, and it was only when\
  \ the waiter brought candles to the table that we realized that, apart from a few\
  \ houses lit by generators, the whole town had turned pitch black. The Rabbit and\
  \ I took to the street, in naive search of a cab. As not a soul had ventured out\
  \ during the day, the few cab drivers of Pushkar had thought better than fruitlessly\
  \ leave their homes. We were left with no choice but to walk. \n\nThankfully, I\
  \ thought, I was carrying the wind-up flashlight that my mother lovingly had imposed\
  \ on me before my trip. Not for lighting purposes, but because the contraption operated\
  \ also as a phone charger. As the Rabbit and I realized that the jalopy -which charged\
  \ phones just fine- only shed light enough for us to see the tip of our noses, a\
  \ deep moo filled the night air. I felt the Rabbit tense up. \u201CDidn\u2019t you\
  \ grew up here?\u201D I half reproached him. The truth was I grew up in a big city,\
  \ and I had never been close to a cow that was not enclosed. Let alone a herd of\
  \ free, elephant-sized ones. \n\nWe had no choice, but to proceed. Immediately,\
  \ we had to reckon with another cow-related issue. Since, unlike me, that night\
  \ the animals did not benefit from an en-suite bathroom, soon enough the Rabbit\
  \ and I had our feet ankle-deep in dung. But that was not our main source of concern.\
  \ As we took a narrow alley, the Rabbit, who had kept an uncharacteristic silence,\
  \ finally whispered: \u201CDid you see any bull, on the way here?\u201D\n\nI stood\
  \ frozen, unable to proceed. The Rabbit tried everything to reassure me, including\
  \ inventing a local law whereby bulls were enclosed at night.  I wasn\u2019t moving.\
  \ After attempting a standing plea (no kneeling in the dung), the Rabbit decided\
  \ to use force, and gave me the gentlest pat on the back. I was on such an edge\
  \ that I shrieked and jumped ahead. And smashed into something big and hairy. \n\
  \nAs I tried to regain my balance in terror, I turned around and saw, lit by the\
  \ dim light of the flashlight, a muzzle approaching me, in one fast movement. I\
  \ braced for impact, hoping that the horns would go straight to the hearth, and\
  \ I would not suffer. And I was hit. By the most forceful lick I had experienced\
  \ in my life. \u201CShe kissed me...\u201D I kept murmuring in a daze, as the Rabbit\
  \ dragged me back to the guesthouse."
