Text: "Last fall, I decided I wanted to change my life and break out of my comfort\
  \ zone. I signed up to do this workshop organized by Seminaria Sogninterra, in a\
  \ small village near Formia, Italy called Maranola. Maranola is a small town of\
  \ nearly 4000 inhabitants, in an area of Italy where the Altino mountains and the\
  \ gulf of Gaeta merge. The town is situated only 3 kms away from the sea, yet the\
  \ Malanolesi possess a culture better integrated with the mountains.\nMy time in\
  \ this small village was spent in this beautiful, medieval house with four other\
  \ girls, which we dubbed \u201CThe house with the bathroom\u201D, because of the\
  \ incredible bathroom downstairs that could rival any spa. Only three minutes walking\
  \ distance from where our other friends were staying, \u201CThe pink house\u201D\
  . Every morning, I would go up to the terrace to gaze at this surreal view of the\
  \ sea and the mountains, enjoying my coffee and a few too many cigarettes. Around\
  \ 11, the group would meet at the main square of the town to discuss our land art\
  \ installation ideas to incorporate into the town\u2019s infrastructure next June.\
  \ During one of these regular meetings, an old inhabitant of Maranola decided to\
  \ join our conversation: Signor Angelo. He lived his entire life in Maranola and\
  \ is in love with the town. He asked us to guess his age. I guessed 63, someone\
  \ said 70-80. We wered shocked to find out that he was a man of 93 years! Living\
  \ in a small town with a sustainable lifestyle sure adds years to one\u2019s life.\
  \ They produce their own olive oil, cheese and salame beside everything else here!\
  \ After our meetings, usually everyone would take some quite time and walk around\
  \ the town, exploring, finding inspiration in the cracks, the nooks and crannies\
  \ of this old town. We would regroup in \u201Cthe house with the bathroom\u201D\
  \ to enjoy dinners together. A dinner staple during some of these nights: a delicious\
  \ plate of Carbonara. After around 10 pm, we would take the party to \u201Cthe pink\
  \ house\u201D, and share a lovely evening with some locally produced red wine. During\
  \ this trip, I for the first time experienced mountain climbing. The air was so\
  \ clean, I had trouble breathing. My lungs weren\u2019t used to it. I was able to\
  \ take in the beauty of a medieval church built high up on the mountains. I learned\
  \ how olive oil was made during the medieval times. I grew closer to my friends\
  \ from the academy, met some amazing local people but what striked me the most out\
  \ of everything I saw in this trip was the \u201CCripta della Madonna del Latte\u201D\
  , the Crypt of the Nursing Madonna. Coming from a more oriental culture in Turkey,\
  \ I wasn\u2019t aware of the imagery of the Nursing Madonna before I set foot in\
  \ Maranola. I found it to be such a powerful and current symbol, when even today\
  \ women are shamed for breastfeeding in public. This crypt in Maranola possesses\
  \ at least nine different depictions of the Nursing Madonna which just leaves me\
  \ in awe. Being an art student, we always find inspiration in the most uncertain\
  \ places but I certainly didn\u2019t expect to find it inside the Crypt of the Nursing\
  \ Madonna. In one of the previous editions of Seminaria Sogninterra, an artist painted\
  \ his own version of the Nursing Madonna which was a piece that was later bought\
  \ by the people of Maranola and has become a staple of the town. After seeing the\
  \ crypt, everything fell into place for me. It all makes sense now. I understand\
  \ the town\u2019s connection to the imagery but it also inspired me for my project\
  \ for next June in Maranola."
