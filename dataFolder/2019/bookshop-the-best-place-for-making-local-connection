Text: "Checking the Google Maps in my phone, when the tram approaching Eastern Street,\
  \ I knew it's time to get off the tram.\nLooking at the steep slope, I realized\
  \ why was this area called Mid-Levels.\nThe bookshop I was heading to, is situated\
  \ on the slope.\nThe small signboards on the roadside, showing the steepness of\
  \ different parts of slope as 1:5 and 1:6 respectively.\nThe long pavement on the\
  \ left hand side, with the wall beside it and the trees planted there, formed a\
  \ nice view.\nOn the other side of the road, there were graffitis and murals on\
  \ the wall in an alley. \nThere was a piece of clothing hanging up on the wall,\
  \ perhaps it was an installation art.\nAfter ten to fifteen minutes of walking,\
  \ I saw the red brick wall,  here it is, Book & Co.\nThe staff said hello to me,\
  \  and I ordered coffee and spaghetti, which costs me merely 50 Hong Kong dollars.\n\
  I put my bag on the chair next to the window, and started to browse through the\
  \ bookshelves.\nI saw the Norwegian Wood Book 2 on the shelf, I wonder where the\
  \ Book 1 was.\nThere were quite a number of preloved CDs and magazines, The New\
  \ Yorker was one of them.\n Esther, the staff who served me coffee and food, talked\
  \ to me about the education system and housing issues in Hong Kong.\nThen, two university\
  \ students Joey and Alson came, all four of us sat in a circle and started to chat,\
  \ like we were in a group discussion in school.\nI do not speak fluent Cantonese,\
  \ so I used English and Mandarin for some terms I was not familiar with.\nI asked\
  \ them how to pronounce the name of the author Liu Yichang, one of my favourite\
  \ writers, in Cantonese. He passed away a month before.\nThey told me, the \"Chang\"\
  \ is pronounced as \"Cheung\" in Cantonese. \nBefore I left, Esther whispered to\
  \ me, saying the location of this bookshop, which is away from the populated areas,\
  \ making it a great place for us to chat without worries of any troubles.\nI think\
  \ visiting bookshop, is indeed the best way to make local connection."
