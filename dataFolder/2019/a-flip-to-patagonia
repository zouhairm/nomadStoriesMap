Text: "The flip of a coin is what took me to Patagonia. After five days in Buenos\
  \ Aires, I could either continue straight west to Cordoba or southwest to Bariloche.\
  \ I threw a one Peso coin into the air and its underside (a sun with a round, Grecian\
  \ face, neither smiling nor frowning) sealed my fate: I was going to Patagonia.\
  \  \n\nTruthfully, I didn\u2019t expect somewhere like Patagonia to be in Argentina.\
  \ I thought Argentina was a \u2018hot\u2019 country, with arid deserts and dense\
  \ rainforests. However, the chilly bite in the air as I got off the 21-hour bus\
  \ confirmed that I was wrong. The bus was an experience in itself: my feet, swelled\
  \ from sitting and jammed into my trainers, felt like puffy paws. As I regained\
  \ the use of my knees, I took in the town\u2019s backdrop: jagged, snow-topped mountains\
  \ and a wide, pulsing lake.\n\nOver the next few days, I did a lot of hiking. (A\
  \ first for me \u2013 I\u2019d previously only \u2018hiked\u2019 a rather large\
  \ hill.) The scenery was incredible, with green pastures a la Sound of Music, frosted\
  \ mountains reaching to the sky and glacial rivers rushing feverishly across smooth\
  \ stones. \u2018A bit like the Alps,\u2019 casually noted a European far more continental\
  \ than me. It was sunny then cloudy, still then windy. Jacket on, jacket off. \n\
  \nIn the middle of a sudden rainstorm, I sought refuge in a wooden cabin with a\
  \ crackling fire. The Argentinian owner, an athletic-looking man with flushed cheeks,\
  \ served up an earthy tonic of Malbec accompanied by chocolate fondue.  \n\nAfter\
  \ Bariloche, I spent the next four weeks travelling through Argentinian and Chilean\
  \ Patagonia. I hitchhiked down the Carretera Austral, which was not the five-lane\
  \ superhighway I had imagined, but rather a quiet dual carriageway. After being\
  \ left in the middle of the road when our bus broke down, my boyfriend and I were\
  \ offered a ride with a man named German Hipp, who waved us to the car, and without\
  \ a word, threw our bags into the back as we jumped in.\n\nGerman was a deep-sea\
  \ diver with a pickup truck who didn\u2019t care that our shared vocabulary consisted\
  \ of thirty words. After the long drive, we retired to Casa Azul, a hotel run by\
  \ a friend of German\u2019s that was decorated with numerous blue glass trinkets\
  \ and stuffed animals.\n\nOver the next month, I hiked miles and miles of dusty\
  \ trails, crossed swaying footbridges and waded through snow to stand beside turquoise\
  \ lakes, looking up at mountain peaks wrapped in ribbons of cloud. I saw glaciers:\
  \ one rough, powder-blue and stretching as far as the eye could see; another in\
  \ the middle of the mountains that looked as though iridescent wax had been poured\
  \ over the slopes. I watched horses running free through lush meadows and the sun\u2019\
  s rosy retreat at 11pm. \n\nI didn\u2019t expect to find what I saw in Patagonia,\
  \ but moreover, I didn\u2019t expect that it would inspire in me a love of nature."
