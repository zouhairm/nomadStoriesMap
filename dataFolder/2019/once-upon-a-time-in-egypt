Text: "Most people usually travel to Egypt to discover the notorious Pyramids , and\
  \ they are not to blame , as the Pyramids are one of humanity's most mesmerizing\
  \ creations . But what I have found during my ten days visit to this beautiful country\
  \ is that Egypt has more to it than just the Pyramids and the Pharoahs. I did of\
  \ course go see them , which is the first thing, anyone who goes to Egypt , should\
  \ do,  but as I was walking the streets of Cairo , the capital of Egypt , I have\
  \ come across many other places that left me in utter awe , the most unorthodox\
  \ place among which however , is probably the local market \"Khan Al Khalili \"\
  ,  just a few blocks from downtown Cairo . The beauty of the experience amplifies\
  \ if you were to go at night , since the streets are then decorated with colourful\
  \ lanterns from the Arab golden age , and the open air restaurants are starting\
  \ to be crowded by tourists from all over the globe . The cab driver dropped me\
  \ next to al Azhar mosque since there was not enough room for cars and from there\
  \ I had to go on foot in what is to be one of the most amazing experiences of my\
  \ life . The sun has just set and the air was cooling , I had to avoid mobile merchants\
  \ who would grab you by the hand and ask you to check their merchandise , in fact\
  \ , if you just say hello back , they would ask you to come in and buy what they\
  \ offer. You could easily start to smell the mixture of cinnamon , cloves , and\
  \ coriander seeds as you make your way through the crowded streets. I stopped by\
  \ to have dinner in one of the open air restaurant , oriental music was being played\
  \ by a group of fairly middle aged men , and you could hear couples and families\
  \ chatting with different accents and languages , it was as if the whole world agreed\
  \ to send one representative to this place to discuss cultural exchange issues.\
  \ After I had Muloukhia and pigeon , apparently the most common meal in the country\
  \ , I started making my way again through the Khan , and I was frankly startstruck\
  \ , hundreds if not a thousand traditionally buit shops from both sides of a norrow\
  \ street , selling all kinds of goods , clothes of all designs and eras , jewelry\
  \ of all prices and shapes , souvenires for tourists , caf\xE9s playing music while\
  \ people smoke pipes and banjos , sweets and candy of all tastes and colours , and\
  \ spices of all origins and smells. You could even find children walking around\
  \ holding mobile libraries and selling books . It is funny that I bought Crime and\
  \ Punishement by Fyodor Dostoyevsky , a writer who refused secularism , from a child\
  \ in a country that once rejected but is slowly embracing it . Another unexpected\
  \ thing I came across while I was walking the streets of the Khan is that once I\
  \ reached the end of the street , I directly entered another market called Al Ataba\
  \ , which is the complete opposite of where I had just been , the Khan has a nineth\
  \ and tenth centuries vibe , wheras the Ataba market is very twenty first century\
  \ , very modern and only trades modern goods , you would find supermarkets , suites\
  \ and t-shirts displayed on glass built shops . Some other places I would recommend\
  \ people to go see are the national meuseum , which contains a marvelous collection\
  \ of ancient Egypt's finest artifacts , you would get to see mummys , statues ,\
  \ ancient weaponery and agriculture tools . As for those who prefer luxurious tourism\
  \ , Sharm al Sheikh is their best option , it is the Egyptian Las Vegas. The coastline\
  \ in that city is quite beautiful and the variety of hotels and resorts leave you\
  \ with a good number of choices . You could also enjoy the company of belly dancers\
  \ , have fun at Aqua Park , go partying in dance clubs , scuba dive , or relax in\
  \ massage centers . All in all , I did not expect Egypt to be this culturally and\
  \ touristically diverse and I would definitely recomment people to visit , preferably\
  \ during spring as summer is pretty hot ."
