Text: "For those of you who don't know, the southern stretch of Thailand\u2019s ravishing\
  \ coastline is a geographic masterpiece of touristic destinations for the conventional\
  \ tourist who\u2019s seeking a fulfilling getaway and an anomalous, riveting culture.\
  \ Though celebrated for its pristine soft sand beaches and nifty jungle bungalows,\
  \ the magical island of Koh Phangan is where most people flock to for its intoxicating,\
  \ unprecedented dance parties. \n\nThis fascinating landmass is the monthly occupier\
  \ of the Full Moon Party, a rave so popular and mind-bending that it draws in backpackers\
  \ and vacationers alike from all around the globe. It\u2019s a rousing night of\
  \ psychedelic neon colour, trance music reverberating deep inside the ventricles\
  \ of your heart and fire dancing that is so mesmerizing that people seem as if they\u2019\
  re under an enchanting, pyromaniac spell... all while being hypnotized by the vibrant,\
  \ rip-roaring glow of an amazingly large, white-hued, full moon above. They think\
  \ to those around them, \u201Cshall we dance.\u201D \n \nAt night the whiskey-drenched\
  \ beach is crowded with intoxicated 20-something-year-olds stumbling back and forth\
  \ to the sound of thumping bass music. People walk the beach with tribal neon paint\
  \ smeared across their bodies \u2014 this paint ritual, with streaks of blue, green,\
  \ red and yellow, is usually commenced back at the hostel during the pre-drinking\
  \ phase of the night where friends slather one another like an artistic canvas.\
  \ Most do not look at their technicolour masterpieces until arriving at Haad Rin\
  \ Beach later that evening where thousands are scattered along the sandy shores,\
  \ dancing like vivid, luminous fairies under the lively moonlight. \n \nLarge, thickly,\
  \ woven ropes are then doused in gasoline and struck with a match, engrossing the\
  \ braiding as if to create a jump rope of fire. The lucky survivors who do not severely\
  \ burn themselves, or by now were not too intoxicated to walk, move onto the next\
  \ challenge, a fire limbo. Watching the fire games is almost as intoxicating as\
  \ the people who compete in them. It\u2019s safe to say that fire is one of the\
  \ most significant, symbolic elements of the Full moon party \u2014 once the fire\
  \ is out, the party is over. \n \nKeeping in mind that Full Moon is an all-night\
  \ commitment, the locals insist that, \u201Cthou shall party until the sun comes\
  \ up.\u201D So, when that sun does come up to sit high in the sky around noon the\
  \ following day, the beach is a barren wasteland of deserted whiskey buckets, eclectic\
  \ glow sticks and broken flip-flops. \n\nBy: Alexandra Wilks"
