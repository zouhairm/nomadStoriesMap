Text: "My stepfather warned me in the beginning \"why do you want to go to Byron Bay,\
  \ it has the highest crime rate on average per capita in Australia\". \n\nI followed\
  \ my heart; Leaving the graffiti street art that dotted along the railway lines,\
  \ thinking of the paint dripped streets and creative alleyway culture, missing the\
  \ bustle of the markets and modern cafes of an aristocrat society. \n\nI said goodbye\
  \ to Melbourne and began a new journey, the plane flew out over the ocean and to\
  \ the north. Along the coast towards the most easterly point of Australia. New beginnings\
  \ with only a small pack to hold my worldly possessions. \n\nI held a cup of hot\
  \ coffee to warm my cold fingers, I allow the bitter sweet smell of the grinds to\
  \ drift into my nose and invigorate my body. I had arrived too early to check into\
  \ my hostel but was able to leave my backpack amongst others in locked area under\
  \ the stairs and had ventured back into the town only metres away to explore.\n\n\
  It was early on an April morning in Autumn that I arrived, a thin layer of cloud\
  \ blocked out the sun and I had to wear a cardigan to shield my torso against the\
  \ chilly and salty sea air that kissed my cheeks then danced around the footpath\
  \ and up the trunks of nearby Palm Tree\u2019s that swing to the sound of their\
  \ own music. On the foreshore there are a couple of large evergreen Norfolk Pines.\
  \ I listen to the Rainbow lorikeets sitting in the branches chiming happily and\
  \ sweetly singing to one another, greeting the day.\n\nByron bay seemed like a long\
  \ lost cousin an instant love and a soul mate. I knew I was right where I needed\
  \ to be in that present moment and felt more alive than ever before. The sun begins\
  \ to shine out from behind the clouds and blue sky slowly appears.\n\nThe township\
  \ is smaller than I expected, the ocean meets the North of the main street and is\
  \ alive with people starting their day, tie dyed hippies selling theirs wears off\
  \ a simple sarong on the ground. Talented street musicians playing gypsy tunes and\
  \ busking on the corner, barefoot surfers grabbing a breakfast juice or smoothie\
  \ after catching a wave. \n\nOn the beach the turquoise waters gently lap against\
  \ the sand, an old ship wreck peers out above the water and a dolphin pup plays\
  \ and glides along a wave with his pod not far behind. Early morning risers head\
  \ east along the sand towards the lighthouse, everyone is smiling and happy and\
  \ every person greets you with warmth.\n\nByron bay is in the rainbow region and\
  \ the streets are saturated with colour and surf culture. As I walk through the\
  \ park I'm curious about a palm reader and fortune teller sitting in the shade with\
  \ a book and wonder what the future does in fact hold for me in the palm of my hand.\
  \ A Krishna religious group is singing and dancing all dressed in simple non embellished\
  \ clothing along the footpath weaving around others singing love to the beat of\
  \ the drum with a few tambourines thrown in for good measure. Smiling and laughing\
  \ loudly as they jive up and down. There are a lot more people that do not wear\
  \ shoes here, Perhaps they are more connected to our Mother Earth. My feet are too\
  \ soft and I enjoy wearing my thongs. \n\nI learn from the local tourist information\
  \ centre that the local indigenous community, The Arakwal people have been coming\
  \ to this sacred and spiritual place for 20,000 years and it is known as  Cavenbah\
  \ \"the meeting place\". It is the spiritual capital of Australia. I'm not surprised\
  \ I was naturally drawn here. Many locals tell me stories that Byron Bay is surrounded\
  \ by Crystals. \n\nLater that day I connect with my first friend in the area, her\
  \ name is Tanaya and when I tell her about my awakening, she tells me \"we are a\
  \ conscious collection of aware people here, Byron will heal you and once you are\
  \ healed you have to leave, if you stay it is your job to help heal others\" this\
  \ resonates within me and I am in awe of the beauty and focus on positive thoughts\
  \ to manifest into reality.\n\nByron bay was formed when Tweed volcano erupted 23\
  \ million years ago, is situated with massive belts of obsidian crystal underfoot\
  \ and also has supposed ley lines although I do not know much about that, however\
  \ I do believe that the Byron Shire is an energetic vortex, you can feel it within\
  \ your soul, she will offer you an opportunity to a deeper connection into which\
  \ you can move very quickly toward your soul\u2019s purpose. Each new day I am inspired\
  \ by nature\u2019s beauty. \n \nI feel what many others feel when first arriving\
  \ to this beautiful place, I am surrounded by love. I am love. \nIn this moment\
  \ i am happy and I have found where I belong.  My first day in Byron Bay."
