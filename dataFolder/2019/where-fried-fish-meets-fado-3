Text: "The caf\xE9 was dim and dingy, tucked into the corner of a forgotten shopping\
  \ mall where everything else was closed. The instructions to get there were appropriately\
  \ cryptic: find the bus station; next door there\u2019s a long hall; it\u2019s at\
  \ the end, on the left. After walking in circles for an hour I arrived, afraid I\
  \ was late for the show.\n\nI\u2019d come in search of fado, the legendary musical\
  \ genre that\u2019s rumored to be ripe with saudade: that untranslatable sense of\
  \ collective nostalgia that defines the Portuguese spirit. Someone had told me this\
  \ was the place to hear it in Porto, every Sunday afternoon.\n\nInside, everything\
  \ was straight out of the mid-twentieth century, from the faded wallpaper to the\
  \ people who populated almost every chair. No one else in the room was under 60\
  \ years old. Their eyes followed me as I found an empty seat: a tan tourist, sweaty\
  \ and stressed from a half-baked scavenger hunt for which this crowded caf\xE9 was\
  \ the prize. The ancient owner shuffled over to me and I ordered a glass of vinho\
  \ verde, which turned out to be a pitcher. \n\nI sipped. They stared. No one sang.\
  \ Was this even the right place?\n\nEventually a woman welcomed the crowd and introduced\
  \ two men who had appeared with guitars. I relaxed a bit and waited for her to begin,\
  \ but instead she handed the mic to a man from the audience, whose friends slapped\
  \ him on the back as he stood. \n\nHe took a deep breath and launched into a song\
  \ unlike anything I\u2019d ever heard: all unadulterated emotion, sorrowful notes\
  \ and inscrutable lyrics. It was slow, and somber, and aching. It was beautiful.\
  \ \n\nOne by one, the audience members stood up to perform. The others closed their\
  \ eyes, swayed, and let the notes wash over them. I tried to do the same. But despite\
  \ this incredible thing I was witnessing, I couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that\
  \ I shouldn\u2019t be here; that I was an unwelcome intruder on some kind of sacred\
  \ ritual.\n\nAnd then a man at my table slid a small miracle toward me. It was a\
  \ deep-fried ball of something, sitting on a grease-stained napkin. I looked up\
  \ to confirm that this was meant for me. He smiled and didn\u2019t say a word. \n\
  \nThe something turned out to be shredded cod, combined with potatoes and spices\
  \ and fried until crispy. It was lukewarm and heavy, rich but not especially flavorful\u2026\
  \ and yet somehow delicious. I devoured it, and soon another fritter followed.\n\
  \nThat did it. Apparently the others had witnessed this peace offering, and soon\
  \ I was being passed portions from every table in the place. A woman with a Tupperware\
  \ full of homemade cake sent a slice my way. Another one, not to be outdone, did\
  \ the same. \n\nBaked goods, croquettes, crusty bread, salt cod in oil with olives,\
  \ all washed down with wine and accompanied by halting conversation, inhibited\u2014\
  but not discouraged\u2014by a considerable language barrier. They suddenly wanted\
  \ to know my name, where I was from, if I liked the music and, perhaps more importantly,\
  \ the food.\n\nSeveral hours later, one of the men took the stage and cleared his\
  \ throat. \u201CFor the young American girl,\u201D he said in Portuguese, then proceeded\
  \ to sing straight to me. Maybe the empty wine pitcher was to blame, but I nearly\
  \ cried.\n\nFado may not have the infectious rhythm of flamenco or the feel-good\
  \ melodies of other genres. But in that caf\xE9, I got it. I felt the sense of community\
  \ and nostalgia that these people were sharing\u2014saudade in its truest form.\n\
  \nWhen I emerged into the daylight, tipsy and teary, I was once again an outsider.\
  \ But with a little ball of greasy cod, that had changed for one afternoon. I had\
  \ been welcomed into a generation and culture that I would never belong to, and\
  \ allowed to witness a tradition that did not belong to me. This group of people,\
  \ who could\u2019ve been my grandparents, who owed me absolutely nothing, gave me\
  \ this gift. \n\nAnd I\u2019ve never looked at fried fish the same way again."
