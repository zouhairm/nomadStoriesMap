Text: "This is first time I'm going alone without friends or family. Honestly I'm\
  \ scared, nervous, I don't know what should I do there. But I'm trying to be fine\
  \ and try my best, because we don't know what will doing in the future before we\
  \ do it.\nSingapore, yes. This is the country I visited in 2017. Literally it's\
  \ near from my country Indonesia just need 2 hours by plane. But honestly it's first\
  \ time for me going by plane and I feel so scared, but it's ok believe me I can\
  \ handle it. Finally arrived in Singapore, there's so much people in the airport.\
  \ I'm just thinking \"Ok, First what should I do?\" The answer is \"WiFi, you need\
  \ internet for send text to your parents\" .\nOk, Connected ......\nAnd I've idea\
  \ for buying tickets for train and bus (cause taxi is so expensive). \nHonestly,\
  \ my English is too low. So I'm going to write some words to translate for buying\
  \ the ticket :(\nTranslate is success.... Time for buy ticket....\nAnd buy ticket\
  \ is success .....\nOk, time for going to me HOSTEL not Hotel. Without WiFi hold\
  \ in, I'm just thinking what should I say to receptionist in my Hostel? Should I\
  \ say \"Hi, I'm Sekar from Indonesia, I want to chack in. This is my print out of\
  \ booked\" ok i said like that.\nFinally arrived at Hostel, and telling like that\
  \ to receptionist, and I'm so happy he's understand what I say.\nJust for you know\
  \ guys, hostel is the best choice for stay why? Cause you can find another roommate\
  \ from another country!\nAnd see.... I have a roommate from France wow how lucky\
  \ I am. I can learn my English with her. She's teaching me, she's understand my\
  \ English and sometimes she's fixed it. Thank God !!\nTomorrow in the morning...\n\
  Oh, I'm forget, I'm going to Singapore for 4D3N.\nIn the morning, I got free breakfast\
  \ from my hostel. Almost 20 peoples who stay in the same hostel doing breakfast\
  \ together. Including me.\nAfter that, I have a plan for going to Merlion Park,\
  \ Marina Bay Sand, etc. (Free places in Singapore I've visited)\nIt's amazing, I\
  \ can do it. Without any friends, without family. I can do it with my low English.\
  \ Yes I try my best for talking or asking for the way.\nIt's really make me out\
  \ from my comfort zone in Indonesia!!\nMeet much of new peoples, new rules, new\
  \ experience. Amazing!!\n\nSo I feel, no problem dear you can do it !!\n\nSo for\
  \ second day until the last day, I do the same things. Visited many places, trying\
  \ foods, walking in the night cause you know Singapore is safe while you walking\
  \ alone in the night. Explore a new experience it'sso awesome, know another culture,\
  \ the most happiness is you can see so much peoples from another country there.\
  \ And practice my English.\n\nThat's all my travel story, hope you enjoy read it.\
  \ And keep learning, explore and stay humble..\n\nRegards\n\nSekar"
