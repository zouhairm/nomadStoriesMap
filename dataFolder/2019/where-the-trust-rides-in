Text: "Dark clouds were looming above Minca. Dan and I sensed time was up to return\
  \ to the hostel. We had been diving and backflipping at the Pozo Azul waterfalls,\
  \ a principal attraction of this charming little village. Even though Pozo Azul\
  \ was a mere five hundred meters from our lodge, we somehow managed to get lost\
  \ at a fork in the path. We found our misfortune so baffling and hilarious that\
  \ we turned into grinning cats, circling back and forth, pondering the right direction\
  \ to follow. The clock was ticking. We made a choice and picked up the pace. We\
  \ had less than thirty minutes to grab our belongings, hop on the motorbikes and\
  \ ride to the town's plaza to meet our Colombian driver. The first droplets began\
  \ to hit the ground.\n\nDan and I first met our driver the night before, on Wednesday,\
  \ November 22. When, earlier that day, we felt ready to move from the sweltering\
  \ lushness of Tayrona National Park to the coolness of Minca, we were certainly\
  \ not inspired to repeat the hefty hike we carried out on Tuesday. Instead, we chose\
  \ a bumpy boat ride that dropped us in the fishing village of Taganga. It was twilight\
  \ when we stepped off the boat at this rather dirty, unimpressive port. I approached\
  \ a passerby to ask him where we could catch our connection to Minca; we had just\
  \ missed it. A husky man by the corner of the road called our attention. \u201C\
  Taxi?\u201D he yelled. \n\nHaving no other obvious option, Dan and I agreed on the\
  \ taxi. Our Colombian driver came across as charismatic and curious. He engaged\
  \ us with enough conversation to glide through the hour-long sinuous journey up\
  \ to Minca. The unpaved road to our hostel was so jerky that for a moment it seemed\
  \ to intimidate even our vigorous driver. \n\n\u201CWhere are you off to tomorrow?\u201D\
  \ the driver asked before we said goodbye. \n\n\u201CWe need to be in Cartagena\
  \ by the evening. We fly to Medellin on Friday afternoon.\u201D\n\nMinca, as petite\
  \ as it is, is not a town you want to breeze by or come to unprepared. Its mountainous\
  \ location at the foothills of the Sierra Nevada means no bus can access it and,\
  \ if you prefer not to take a taxi, then you're at the mercy of collective vans\
  \ that may be full just when you need them. \n\n\u201CI propose this,\u201D he suggested,\
  \ \u201CI can come back tomorrow to pick you up and drive you to the terminal where\
  \ you can catch the last direct bus to Cartagena. But we must leave at two. Oh,\
  \ and I\u2019ll bring a larger car. For your stuff.\u201D\n\nIt was Thursday, almost\
  \ two o\u2019clock. A downpour outside. The motorbikes that minutes earlier were\
  \ riding through mud puddles left us where we agreed to join our driver. No taxi\
  \ in sight. I noticed a silver sedan parked in front of the church that sits at\
  \ the center of the plaza. From it, our driver came out and waved. As we approached\
  \ the sedan, I gazed at its pitch-black windows. My skin crawled.   \n\nDan got\
  \ in. I was half inside when I saw a man with bulkier and grimmer features occupying\
  \ the passenger seat. My heart sank. With one leg out of the car, I questioned the\
  \ driver about the unexpected passenger. He said this was his brother\u2014who glared\
  \ at me as if sniffing fear. Here I was with a beloved friend, about to embark on\
  \ a trip with two strangers twice our size combined. The driver tried to get us\
  \ to stay. I asked for his license\u2014he didn't have it. Dan, staring at my haunted\
  \ expression, asked, \"What do you want to do? Whatever it is, I support you.\"\
  \ \n\n\"Let's go,\" I replied. We stepped out swiftly but careful and walked towards\
  \ The Lazy Cat, a vegan joint across the street. \n\n\"Are you alright?\" Dan asked.\
  \ I nodded quietly while I felt my eyes welling up. My friend trusted me enough\
  \ to put our Cartagena trip at risk. To be frank, I wasn\u2019t sure what just had\
  \ happened. Yet, I sensed this was the right direction to follow. We now needed\
  \ to pick up the pace."
