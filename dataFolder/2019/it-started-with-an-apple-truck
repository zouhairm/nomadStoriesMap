Text: "It started with an apple truck. The back of an apple truck, to be precise;\
  \ weaving its way from the port at Cherbourg through the pancake-flat plains of\
  \ Northern Normandy. We could take as many apples as we liked, the driver told us.\
  \ Next, a sports car. Shiny. Tiny. We squeezed in, backpacks on laps, from Caen\
  \ to Le Mans. He was polished and poised. He didn\u2019t look like the kind of man\
  \ who would pick up hitch-hikers. He bought us lunch. Our third ally was a lady\
  \ who reminded me of my mother. Drawn in by our smiles and our signs, she had kind\
  \ eyes. We spoke in French, of our families and our futures. She drove us through\
  \ the Loire Valley and left us with an invitation to dinner and a warm place to\
  \ stay should our fortune run out. It nearly did; but, as night began to fall, the\
  \ rumble of a lorry. A window wound down to a worn, weathered face. Then a shrug,\
  \ a smile. Plenty of space for a few more, we thundered down toward Bordeaux and\
  \ then, the border. Our first night was spent adjacent to the autoroute; a two man-tent,\
  \ three people. It wasn\u2019t the traffic noises or the close quarters that kept\
  \ us from sleeping; we were full of frenzy and friendship and faith. \n\nThe next\
  \ morning, a sunrise stroke of luck! A minibus of Portuguese tourists; driven erratically\
  \ but generously, humorously, into Spain and the sunny side streets of San Sebastian.\
  \ We heard our next ride before we saw it; the revs and roars of a rally car \u2013\
  \ another unlikely accomplice - which rallied us to Pamplona. After a day to enjoy\
  \ the old town\u2019s old ways, a serenely still Sunday morning started slowly and\
  \ crescendoed in kindness. A stranger in a station wagon, going to visit his sister.\
  \ He had floppy hair and a gentleness that betrayed his stature and he drove us\
  \ three hours out of his way. We stumbled our way through clumsy Spanish, but gracias\
  \ did not feel like enough. As Valladolid and Salamanca swept by, the rugged terrain\
  \ of central Spain swelled toward the boulevards and baroque buildings of the capital.\
  \ A Monday in Madrid. It was easy to arrive, and to exit. But we weren\u2019t prepared\
  \ for what came next; a ride from a well-meaning white-collar worker left us liftless\
  \ and listless in Toledo. I called my mum (of course I did) and she shared some\
  \ wise words (of course she did) about highs and lows, which propelled us over train\
  \ tracks and down hills towards E-roads and Plan-Bs.\n\nWe arrived in Seville at\
  \ dusk. It was Semana Santa and the city streets were rife with revelry; the roads\
  \ like rivers. As we ate ice-creams and careened through the crowds in search of\
  \ our guesthouse, we became swept up in the swell of the parade, floating amongst\
  \ the floats with only our backpacks for buoyancy. Our sleep that night felt like\
  \ we were at sea, gently rocked to sleep to a soundtrack of celebration. And awaking\
  \ felt equally festive; outlined with outdoor cafes and orange trees. And then,\
  \ on we went. Marina had jet black hair and a scruffy dog. She ushered us from Seville\
  \ to Jerez and she wore purple. \n\nIt started with an apple truck, and it ended\
  \ \u2013 well, this part of the story, at least \u2013 in a surfer\u2019s van. He\
  \ was young and tanned and chasing the swell and, nestled between his boards, he\
  \ transported us to our final stop, Tarifa. As we approached the port and gazed\
  \ across the strait to our next cluster of curveballs, we \u2013 my friends, the\
  \ surfer and I - bit into our last adornment of apples. The surfer looked at me,\
  \ smiling: \u201CIt tastes sweet!\u201D. I still remember that. It still does."
