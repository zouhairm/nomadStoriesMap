Text: "Escaping the thronging crowds of the city and the crippling heat of India in\
  \ July, I traveled to the mountains of Kerala for a bit of breathing space.  Now,\
  \ surrounded by tea and coffee farms and small villages, I could relax for a bit\
  \ in my month-long trek across the Indian Subcontinent.\n\nOne afternoon, I found\
  \ myself at a Hindu temple on a rural, back road.  One of those ancient stone beauties\
  \ with multitudes of gods and goddesses carved in rock.  The temple complex was\
  \ mostly outdoors, with only a small enclosed building to house the main god.  Though\
  \ there had been several cars in the parking lot, but I found myself alone with\
  \ the deities as I toured.  \n\nThen I noticed voices coming from the the river\
  \ that flowed along the boundary of the temple.  That\u2019s where the people were.\
  \  I wasn\u2019t surprised.  It\u2019s not unusual to find ancient temples at natural\
  \ locations, like a river.  In Mumbai I had seen a temple in the middle of a crowded\
  \ city with an ancient tree growing through it.  When I hiked to the top of a mountain\
  \ near Bangalore, I found Shiva\u2019s trident at the crest.  How old this place\
  \ was, I wondered?  The stones were ancient.  The statues were ancient.  But the\
  \ river, how old was the river?  What was it about this spot in the river that inspired\
  \ the ancients to build this beautiful temple?\n\nAnd the river was still the destination.\
  \  That's where the people were.  Lonely for company, I walked towards the voices\
  \ and found ghats - stairs leading into the water.  I sat on the ghats, looking\
  \ out at the multi-generational families picnicking, swimming, enjoying a beautiful\
  \ summer day.  The women were fully covered.  The men bare skinned from the waist\
  \ up, except for the cord of the twice born along their torso - the sacred symbol\
  \ worn by the upper castes.  I took out my lunch and joined the scene.\n\nA young\
  \ woman came and sat with me.  She was a university student who hoped to go to graduate\
  \ school in the U.S.  She told me how her family liked to come to this temple. \
  \ How it was important to immerse themselves in the waters and be here together.\
  \  I told her I could feel the sacredness of this place.  She assured me that it\
  \ was holy and swimming in the river was a way to be close to god.    \n\nAs we\
  \ talked, she pointed out the fish in the river.  \u201CLook how big they are,\u201D\
  \ she said. \u201CBecause this is sacred water, these fish are sacred fish too.\
  \  No one will catch them or eat them, so they live to be old and grow large.\u201D\
  \  Indeed, the fish were huge!  Happily swimming in the clear waters of the mountain\
  \ river, alongside the people.  \n\nI wondered at this ancient ritual of immersing\
  \ oneself in waters - a ritual found in so many religious traditions in the world.\
  \  What was the human need to ritually cleanse ourselves?  I wondered at the sense\
  \ of the sacred I felt in this place.  I wondered how this young woman would long\
  \ for these waters when she moved to the United States.  I wondered at the vastness,\
  \ yet intimate nature of our world, where I, a woman from Kansas could meet a woman\
  \ from Kerala and have a conversation about fishing."
