Text: "My wife and I traveled to Baja, Mexico a few years ago and we were pleasantly\
  \ surprised at the beauty of this country. As an ocean lover, the Todos Santos area\
  \ fit all my travel needs: beach, sunny warm days, great food, friendly people.\
  \ We had a casita steps from the ocean and took many walks on the beach, even spotting\
  \ whales off shore! It was relaxing and just what was needed after escaping the\
  \ harsh Vermont winter.\n   We decided to venture to a restaurant that had a pool.\
  \ I was not sure what to expect. We drove down a long, windy, dirt road and found\
  \ the spot. There was a beach nearby that looked pretty popular. There was some\
  \ construction going on and the workers looked quite busy and definitely had sun\
  \ protection which stood out. We went up a flight of stairs into the main dining\
  \ area and were seated. What struck me and totally captivated me was the pool. It\
  \ looked warm and inviting and it looked like it extended over air! \n   After a\
  \ delicious meal, we ventured into the pool. It was amazing. You could just get\
  \ in and swim towards the balcony like you were swimming into a body of water elevated\
  \ in the air-which it was. I have never swam at a restaurant. It never occurred\
  \ to me that this was even possible. It created an air of bonding when others ventured\
  \ in and was fun to watch people swim towards the horizon. This was a place I would\
  \ happily return to!"
