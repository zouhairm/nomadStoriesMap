Text: "Too many days, I finish up work already focused on things I have to do at home\
  \ or just wanna get away from the maddening crowds. Then there are days when I get\
  \ reminded of, well, life.  When the thing that was missing at those times when\
  \ one feels something is missing but just can't quite pinpoint it, is now in front\
  \ of you, you're in the middle of it, living it. No explaining yourself. You needn't\
  \ anyone else telling you what it is because the clarity of it is undeniable.\n\
  It would have been one of those U-Bahn rides which tend to be a prime example of\
  \ dull. Yes, the very same ride that was new, fast-paced and exciting when I was\
  \ in a \u201Cdating phase\u201D with the city. Such commutes, packed with sad-faced\
  \ people, really make me doubt my decision of making a big city my temporary residence.\n\
  I\u2019ve decided my last cents would go to the guy playing a couple of catchy but\
  \ hearty singalongs. With my singing, I seemed to be as much a part of the performance\
  \ as he was. Then, just as my stop was coming up, he was to play 'Feeling Good'\
  \ by Nina Simone: \u201CWell ain\u2019t that just the song I need to hear right\
  \ now!\u201D I slouched into the nearby seat, made myself real comfortable, gazed\
  \ up to where the stars should be and listened to him butcher the song for another\
  \ two or three stations. It was awful. I should have been rolling my eyes but I\
  \ couldn't help simply smiling. One can only spoil a classic to a point. Whatever\
  \ change I\u2019ve had in my pocket, ended up in his beat-up mandolin case. As an\
  \ add on I offered a cheese crusted bagel, which he denied. His bag could have been\
  \ full of food already, as he claimed, or perhaps he was vegan and didn't want to\
  \ seem ungrateful.\nStepping off the train I found myself at an unknown station.\
  \ In the distance, a promising graffiti was grabbing my attention so I flew down\
  \ a flight of stairs while pirouetting around a slow walker, avoiding the smell\
  \ of stale piss, only to be caught by a breeze that pushed me towards a piece of\
  \ street art. The day didn't stop herm however.  Thebreeze strengthened to a wind\
  \ that guided me onto another street where I found myself a bit at a loss on where\
  \ to turn. The neon lights from nearby shops and falafels, the streets lights and\
  \ car lights all reflected in the puddles of the afternoon torrential rain. The\
  \ air was cold and crisp. I was in no hurry to go home. Looking up and down the\
  \ street, I spotted signs of life through a nearby window. My explorer instinct\
  \ kicked in, ushering me inside a through a door, hoping to find that Skatalites\
  \ album I was grooving to last night on the other side. I flipped through various\
  \ covers and various prices, trying to find my champion, looking around to locate\
  \ someone more knowledgeable than myself. \nI found him in the form of a perfectly\
  \ ordinary gentleman behind the counter. What was to follow surprised both of us.\
  \ Not so much what we were talking about but the way we acknowledged each other\
  \ as human beings, rather than a means to an end. What was only to be a simple question\
  \ about having a certain record, turned out to be a meeting of kindred spirits.\
  \ A meeting of two generations, starring at the age gap between them, knowing full\
  \ well of it's vastness yet still going forth with laying down the cornerstones\
  \ of the bridge of mutual respect. It was in this very record shop I was once again\
  \ reassured that Berlin, despite it's ways of bringing me down, is a place I belong\
  \ to while at the same time being that missing something I could not pinpoint."
