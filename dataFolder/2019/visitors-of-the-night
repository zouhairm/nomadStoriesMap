Text: "I experienced this while staying in a small town in the African bush. This\
  \ was my second time outside the U.S., with the first having been Germany for a\
  \ much shorter period. We were sleeping/visiting places to which I was not accustomed.\
  \ This night I decided to read, then use the bathroom after everyone else had gone\
  \ to sleep. When I returned to the bedroom, I saw something that I\u2019d not seen\
  \ up to that time or since. Bugs all across the floor, some making their way up\
  \ the walls, a few on the ceiling. Bugs, of types and sizes, that I\u2019d never\
  \ seen! I had quite a conundrum on my hands. Do I turn out the lights, thus welcoming\
  \ more visitors, or keep the lights on and see exactly where and what these creatures\
  \ go and do. Realizing that I\u2019d be slightly more comfortable with the unknown,\
  \ I turned out the lights. Low and behold, I awoke the next morning! Perhaps I ingested\
  \ some added protein in the night. I\u2019ll never know and don\u2019t think that\
  \ I wish to.\nThis night taught me several things about traveling (and life). Do\
  \ not alert others to your worries if they would exist happily otherwise. I had\
  \ the initial urge to wake a friend. Why?! To feel better in the moment, but keep\
  \ them from sleep. I didn\u2019t awaken anyone, nor tell them the next day. They\
  \ slept peacefully and were none the wiser. I was also able to see what others are\
  \ capable of and likewise what I can overcome and am capable. We are a resilient\
  \ species with the capacity for a wealth of experience. What holds us back, ourselves\
  \ and a past that tells us otherwise. Look forward to waking up in the morning,\
  \ knowing that your fears did not conquer you."
