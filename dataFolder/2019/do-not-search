Text: "I dreamed of visiting Barcelona. And once this dream came true. Barcelona literally\
  \ \"knocked me down\" with its charm and atmosphere. Of course, the creations of\
  \ Gaudi were the first in the list of required places to visit. I noted in advance\
  \ on the paper map all the required and possible places that I would like to see.\
  \ Sagrada Familia, the houses of Gaudi - they all conquered me, and I was so full\
  \ of man-made beauty that I wanted to dilute it with the beauty of nature. So the\
  \ next day I went to Mount Tibidado. From it, I decided to walk down the dusty road,\
  \ on which I sometimes met runners. At the bottom, Barcelona was visible, the sun\
  \ was shining brightly, and around it was silence and peace. At some point I decided\
  \ to cut a long way and go down the path that turned out to be a path for mountain\
  \ bikers. It is good that they noticed me and did not shoot me down. And below was\
  \ already a wide road, beyond which houses, gardens and people could be seen. I\
  \ noticed a small building that looked like a temple, standing out from the rest\
  \ of the houses. I went to him, although I was tired. Coming closer, I realized\
  \ that this is Torre Bellesguard, one of the works of the great Gaudi. At that time,\
  \ this building was not so popular, and just recently opened for tourists. I bought\
  \ a ticket and wanted to enter the building. But it turned out that you can visit\
  \ it only as part of the tour. Next to the house, in the garden there was a small\
  \ fair where they cooked food, served wine and sold jewelry and clothes. There I\
  \ waited for my excursion. Inspired, I walked behind everyone and only in the house\
  \ I realized that the guide spoke Spanish. And I do not know Spanish. But you know,\
  \ surprisingly, when the guide described the house, its structure, it seemed to\
  \ me that I understand it. I understand everything that the great architect wanted\
  \ to convey and why he did everything that way. Could this \u201Ccollective unconscious\u201D\
  \ that Jung talked about worked?\nIn the evening, I shared my impressions of my\
  \ day with my friends from Barcelona. They were surprised at my story about Torre\
  \ Bellesguard, because there was little mention of it. And I opened my map and found\
  \ a note that I would like to visit this place.\nAnd in life it happens. Unconsciously,\
  \ by intuition you go to something, but when you find it, you understand that you\
  \ have been looking for exactly this for a long time."
