Text: This is not just an ordinary travel story. I am a teacher, who has a hobby of
  traveling. However, no one who has compilation will travel. Peswat tickets, places
  and so on. My first tour might be quite unique and at the same time became my first
  experience of riding fast. Begins with a dream. And even that big dream manifests.
  In September last year, a dream to travel to the island of Gods / Bali became a
  dream. My first tourism journey was obtained from the ASEAN science teacher nomination
  as one of the winners in the award for education competition in the 2nd KHD Award
  2018. And it was a gift from God to me, and my dedication was supported to advance
  education which led me to use free tours to Bali - Indonesia. Bali is very interesting
  and becomes the dream of every person in the whole world. Bali to me is one of the
  paradise gardens that has fallen to earth. Travel for me is not just a trip. Tourism
  is a medium to rediscover lost spirit, improve a mood that is saturated with daily
  routines. With a face I can find new friends, beautiful new places, as well as be
  grateful for the blessings and blessings God has given me. There I can learn new
  things, enjoy the local wisdom of the local people. Bali for me is not only a geographical
  area, it provides a complex tourist spot. There we can find the tranquility of a
  pampered soul with a beautiful panorama. By registering and taking part in this
  2019 Travel Writing Scholarship to Portugal, I hope to gain new knowledge offered
  in the field of writing travel. Thank you World Nomads
