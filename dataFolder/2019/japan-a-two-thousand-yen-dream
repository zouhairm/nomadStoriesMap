Text: "I am so interested in all of about Japan, especially the language. I bought\
  \ some tutorial books of Japan language to learn it by myself when I was in my senior\
  \ high school. I was so happy to get the gift from my former lecturer. He finished\
  \ his doctoral in Japan last September in 2011. He announced all of the student\
  \ in his research group to meet him. He gave me 2000 yen and said to me that I was\
  \ not allowed to exchange them in rupiahs. He asked me to keep them. Suddenly I\
  \ thought by my self \u201Cif I keep to save them, could I go to japan like you,\
  \ Sir?\u201D. \nOn 2017 last November, my friend asked me to go to Japan with her.\
  \ There was a Japan Fair in \u201CKota Casablanca\u201D mall. Many airplane ticket\
  \ promos were offered there. From Soekarno Hatta International airport to Narita\
  \ airport plus vice versa were only four millions rupiahs. \u201CWow, that\u2019\
  s amazing!\u201D. Of course yes, I took the offering. We took the departure on 8th\
  \ January 2018. We had 2 months for preparing all of necessary stuffs to go to the\
  \ place we have never been yet, booked the suitable hotel from Airbnb website which\
  \ was suitable with our budget, surfed the informations of recreation places, booked\
  \ an one day tour to Fuji Mount, bought winter fashion in Lazada application such\
  \ as winter coat, winter shoes, winter gloves with airproof, etc. \nThe first adventure\
  \ in Japan begun. We arrived safely in Narita airport on 8th January at 5 pm in\
  \ Japan time. After our arrival, we tried to follow the signs with English words\
  \ in it till we found the identity checking place of the airport. I wondered what\
  \ the people did with the card at the locket. That\u2019s the form of our identity\
  \ to entrance Japan. We must fill in the form completely with the address of our\
  \ booking hotel in Japan and the contact person of the owner. With so long queuing,\
  \ finally we passed the gate. One problem was finished, another problems came, what\
  \ should we do!? Where is the exit!? So amazing! This airport likes a labyrinth!\
  \ Enough for making us dizzy, in addition to many people didn\u2019t understand\
  \ about English. With my understanding of Japanese language a little bit and with\
  \ using google translate we made it to the train station at 11 pm in Atsugi Prefecture\
  \ where our hotel took place. We used google map to search our hotel by walking.\
  \ We walked around almost 4 hours in the rain. Well, google map could become error\
  \ sometimes, and we were the victims of it. Family Mart which is open 24 hours was\
  \ our last hope. We followed the directions he gave with still using google map.\
  \ And finally we arrived in our hotel at 3 am with the temperature of the weather\
  \ was 4 degree Celsius. So tired due to the long night we got and long journey to\
  \ Shinjuku Prefecture, we were late to join the tour we already booked. We decided\
  \ to enjoy our sadness in this prefecture until we met new Japanese friend. She\
  \ was a senior high school, so kind person with fluently English. She guided us\
  \ to Tokyo tower and told us many things about Japanese culture especially about\
  \ \u201COmikuji\u201D near the temple close to the tower. I took a paper of Omikuji\
  \ which was tied at the nets. She told me that\u2019s the voice of the God for the\
  \ people who tied the paper there. About 2 hours we walked around there, the time\
  \ for goodbye coming. I gave her like what my former lecturer gave to me but with\
  \ different value and currency. I told her \u201Cmaybe it will not so precious for\
  \ you, but with 6000 rupiahs I would like to share my dream for you so that you\
  \ can go to Indonesia like you dream on. My lecturer did the same thing I did by\
  \ giving me 2000 yen\u201D. The sweetest moment I have ever got in my life. With\
  \ bravery, I could get the precious experience becoming stranger in the new place\
  \ and also get new Japanese friend who I didn\u2019t expect to find."
