Text: "Whenever I'm asked where I'm from I hesitate, searching for the right answer.\
  \ The most obvious choice seems to be the city in which I was born. Yet my family\
  \ moved when I was just eight, beginning a series of moves throughout my childhood\
  \ and teen years as my father pursued a new career path. The next best answer seems\
  \ to be the place I currently live, which incidentally is the place I've lived the\
  \ longest. Yet it doesn't seem to bear justice to say this is where I'm from since,\
  \ in my heart, it doesn't always feel like home. But what is home? \n\nMany years\
  \ ago, I found myself on a plane having set out on an impromptu trip to Chicago.\
  \ The trip's purpose: to see a band who had recently found me and captured my heart.\
  \ Experiencing this music live would be what I saw as the culmination of my heart's\
  \ love story. As soon as I stepped foot onto Chicago's streets, I felt home. For\
  \ the first time. As I found my way to Bucktown and into the heights of this music\
  \ and arts festival taking place in its lively streets, my ears filled with the\
  \ music that pulled me there. I pushed my way throughout a maze of moving bodies,\
  \ a sea of arms and legs propelling me forward and back until I reached the stage.\
  \ During that 90 minute concert I was free to live in the moment of what felt like\
  \ home. The music at times invigorated and at times tore down, an endless whirl\
  \ of emotion that had me holding hands with a stranger who wept beside me. \n\n\
  Years later I found myself a stranger in a new land. I had come to Italy, a fish\
  \ out of water on my first international vacation. I never expected to feel so lost,\
  \ though I expected a language barrier and inability to use my beloved GPS to navigate\
  \ me along the journey. Yet the simplest things became mountains to climb. Antique\
  \ skeleton keys frustratingly kept me locked out of apartments I'd rented. Maps\
  \ were no match for the dizzying, unmarked streets and alleyways of each new city\
  \ I entered. I despised Naples: a torrential rainstorm kidnapped my umbrella and\
  \ turned my city map into a soggy, ink-blurred mess. Sitting in the center of a\
  \ piazza I sobbed as hard as the rain, despairingly wishing to be home. \n\nThen\
  \ in the subterranean jungle of a foreign metro I heard the sound of song. A diminutive\
  \ woman sat at a tattered piano, pulling long melodious notes from its creamy keys.\
  \ I recognized the tune, a song of my childhood. Instantly I was transported to\
  \ the living room of my birth home, dancing in slippery socks on the hardwood floor\
  \ to the tune my father played as he sat proudly at his ebony piano. In this metro\
  \ basement, with terms of people all speaking foreign languages, I felt home again\
  \ with the realization that music is the same in any language. \n\nThat music lifted\
  \ me up and propelled me forward: to Florence. As soon as I stepped out of the train\
  \ station and onto the cobbled streets of this city, I felt home, that same feeling\
  \ deep in my heart I felt those first moments in Chicago what seemed a lifetime\
  \ ago. My Italian Chicago. Once again I found myself in a torrential downpour, only\
  \ this time there were no tears. I ducked against the side of a building.  The door\
  \ opened, and a tall man with glasses welcomed me inside, out of the rain. Looking\
  \ up at the sign, I saw it was a cafe. With a Michelin star. Perhaps not a bad place\
  \ to escape the rain. Many meals I had there over the coming week, the staff and\
  \ ambiance my own version of Cheers, welcoming me daily. It was here I finally understood\
  \ the concept of home. Perhaps home isn't a physical address, but a feeling, an\
  \ experience. It's in the spaces and faces of our travel, the hands of weeping strangers\
  \ we hold in our hearts regardless of where time takes us."
