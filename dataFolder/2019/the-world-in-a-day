Text: "Disgruntled, weary and uncomfortable, nine Irish girls sat draped on the benches\
  \ of Berlin Central Station. It was 5am and we had disastrously miscalculated our\
  \ train times. Having left Amsterdam seven hours ago, we only had twenty-four more\
  \ until we needed to be back to catch another train. When we had planned our interrailing\
  \ journey, we forgot to factor in sleep. Now, we needed to experience Berlin, the\
  \ epicentre of European culture, of global history and strength, in just one day.\n\
  \nWe emerged from Berlin\u2019s Hauptbahnhof to saturated streets. Even our Corkonian\
  \ storms paled in comparison to the bad luck which pelted the concrete ahead of\
  \ us. With the clock ticking, there was no time to let the rain subside as we arrived\
  \ in the towering Tiergarten district. Looking more like we had swam the Spree than\
  \ arrived by metro, I spluttered our first destination to a receptionist - \u2018\
  die Berliner Mauer?\u2019\n\nDiligently manoeuvring the directions of \u2018links,\
  \ und gerade\u2026 und recht,\u2019 the monochromatic streets of Berlin\u2019s bad\
  \ weather gave way to technicolour as we approached the East Side Gallery. The 1316\
  \ metre long remnant of the Berlin Wall, painted by artists as an ode to the magnificence\
  \ which can grow from darkness, made us forget about our soaked heads. \u2018Many\
  \ small people who in many small places do many small things that can alter the\
  \ face of the world,\u2019 a translated portion reads, resonating literally and\
  \ figuratively with the girls that stood at its feet. As the deluge descended and\
  \ we aligned Google maps with our next location, it hit me how tiny we really were\
  \ in this grand scheme of things - but, for once, it didn\u2019t scare me.\n\nFeeling\
  \ the clothes grow heavier on my back, the metro ride to Mitte was welcomed by all\
  \ of us. Ascending from the station, Berlin was brighter. The sun made a beacon\
  \ of the Reichstag roof as we meandered through midday crowds to reach the city\u2019\
  s Holocaust memorial. Entitled \u2018Memorial to the Murdered Jews of Europe,\u2019\
  \ the structure consists of 2711 blocks of concrete all varying in size. I felt\
  \ the heaviness of my heart rather than clothes as I stepped into the labyrinth\
  \ and tagged along to an English-speaking tour. \u2018The architect has never defined\
  \ the meaning,\u2019 she said, \u2018and that is it\u2019s metaphor in itself. Without\
  \ true meaning or warning, millions of Jewish people were captured and incarcerated\
  \ in concentration camps. They felt disorientated, trapped\u2026.\u2019 The guide\
  \ trailed off as I attempted to locate the other girls. Wandering between blocks\
  \ which rose and eclipsed the sun, history felt terrifyingly tangible. Racism, hatred,\
  \ evil, all exist as we exist, it is not some extinct force which died when the\
  \ war did. Emerging from the darkness, I remembered an old Irish idiom as the eight\
  \ other girls appeared from within; \u2018N\xEDl tuile d\xE1 mh\xE9ad nach dtr\xE1\
  nn\u2019 - there is no flood, however great, that does not ebb.\n\nAbandoning Google\
  \ Maps, we savoured our Grey City as we arrived at Berlin\u2019s Breitscheidplatz\
  \ district. The doors of the Kaiser-Wilhelm-Ged\xE4chtniskirche, a ruin of a church\
  \ disfigured in a 1943 bombing raid, are open and singing. The chorus echoes across\
  \ the dimly-lit square as the Goldener Riss memorial severs the pavement. It is\
  \ the site of the 2016 attack on the Breitscheidplatz Christmas market, of which\
  \ there was twelve victims. The church, unrestored as a reminder of the war, has\
  \ remained a site of pain, and of heartbreak. But as I listened to the music, I\
  \ recalled the quote on the Berlin Wall - \u2018Viele kleine Leute die in vielen\
  \ kleinen Orten viele kleine Dinge tun k\xF6nnen das Gesicht der Welt ver\xE4ndern.\u2019\
  \n\nA city as imbued with tragedy as it is hope, in Berlin I found proof that goodness\
  \ will always triumph and that all floods will ebb. Now, as pink and apricot hues\
  \ infused the Berliner skies, we finally slept - we had run out the clock."
