Text: "I am an American, but I have always been fascinated with other cultures. So\
  \ it would make sense that I would get my BA in Sociology. Italy was the third country\
  \ I had traveled to, but my first study abroad experience. I fell in love with the\
  \ language, food, the passion for life, the people, and the beauty that surrounded\
  \ me. \n\n There are many stories I could share of my two and a half months of living\
  \ in Italy, but here is one that I still think about. One night I was walking alone\
  \ in Rome, back from our classroom, where we had watched an Italian movie. I was\
  \ hearing Italian as I walked along, paying attention to the interactions around\
  \ me, looking at the exquisite architecture, and breathing in the night air. Then\
  \ I was the only one walking in the area, and I realized I was alone. At one point,\
  \ I looked up at the sky, and I noticed how many stars I could see. Then it hit\
  \ me, I was alone, but I did not feel alone. I did not feel sad, or lonely. Instead,\
  \ I felt excited and fulfilled. I felt at home, and yet I had only been in Italy\
  \ a few days. I had never experienced true happiness like this before, and it was\
  \ not a person who gave me this feeling. It was an unfamiliar culture that made\
  \ me feel more at home, then I had ever felt anywhere else. A culture I was just\
  \ getting to know.\n\nSo much of my life has been spent rushing here and there,\
  \ with rarely a time to slow down. The workaholic mindset of the American culture.\
  \ In Italy, even though I did have classes, I was able to adopt the Italian way.\
  \ To work hard, but to slow down and enjoy life. Enjoy a meal with your family,\
  \ friends, or neighbors. See, hear, taste, feel, and experience life. Italians know\
  \ how to live life to the fullest, and I had forgotten how to do that. I had lost\
  \ the child inside of me that had a zest for life, and a healthy curiosity. That\
  \ is until I came to live in Rome, and experience Naples, and Florence. I have so\
  \ many other places I wish to explore, but there is no doubt in my mind that I will\
  \ return one day, to the culture I felt at home in."
