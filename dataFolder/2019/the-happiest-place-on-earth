Text: "There are tiny red, yellow, green, white and blue squares waving with the wind,\
  \ greeting me through the window. What I had mistaken for power lines, until we\
  \ came closer. Thousands and thousands of little flags tied together, the power\
  \ of a nation in pieces of delicate thin cloth. \nThe wheels drop down with a heavy\
  \ clunk and the airstrip landing comes closer, closer as huge green mountain ridges\
  \ begin to envelop the windows. Music plays, a soft woodwind Asian sound. The landing\
  \ feels too narrow, too short - but with a gentle pull we are on land safely and\
  \ I learn that this is one of the most difficult landings a pilot can make. \n\n\
  Welcome to Bhutan - a secret from tourists for thousands of years, a country that\
  \ defiantly refuses to give up their traditional values. You won't find an ATM that\
  \ works here. No shopping malls or fast food places. The capital city employs a\
  \ man to direct the traffic; he stands in an ornately decorated shelter and points\
  \ the way. So, no traffic lights here either.\n\nDriving along unsealed roads ruled\
  \ by stray dogs and meandering cows, I spy a pair of eyes. The eyes are painted,\
  \ fixed in an upturned smile, on the face of a large truck. 'Long Live Our King'\
  \ and 'Horn Please', the truck proclaims.\n\nThis is the 'Happiest Place on Earth'.\
  \ \n\nA man with a round face and smooth brown skin greets me, smiling. It's not\
  \ the bold and wide type of smile I see back home in Australia. His smile is quiet,\
  \ reassuring and reserved. He's wearing what looks to be a patterned long coat wrapped\
  \ around with white cloth underneath. His name is Payza and he will be my guide.\
  \ Bhutan is different - in an effort to protect their country, all tourists must\
  \ be guided by a local.\n\nThe best thing I encountered during my week here was\
  \ not the devoted locals circumambulating stupas in prayer. Nor was it the intense\
  \ hike through the clouds, up to the stunning Tiger's Nest monastery. It wasn't\
  \ the photogenic dzongs or the quiet chatter of monks.\nIt was a simple meal, sitting\
  \ on the floor around a small coffee table, enjoyed on my last night here. \n\n\
  My guide and new friend Payza invited me to dine with his family and closest friends.\
  \ \"This is not a normal inclusion in the tour guides,\" he laughs. This is my first\
  \ solo travel adventure and I'm a little apprehensive about going to the private\
  \ residence of people I've only known for a few days. I swallow my nervousness and\
  \ agree; my instincts tell me that he is a trustworthy and honest man. On the drive,\
  \ he offers the disclaimer, \"it is not much, but we are happy\". He apologises\
  \ for the mess. I see the village they live in and their pet dogs. I do not think\
  \ it is messy. It feels familiar.\n\nOver dinner, I meet his little girl who practices\
  \ her English with me. Busy in the kitchen is his wife, she shares her dreams to\
  \ one day own a beauty salon, a business of her own. We gather around the table\
  \ and share chilli and cheese, a Bhutanese specialty, alongside cooked fragrant\
  \ greens and hot tea. The family gets out their acoustic guitar, confessing that\
  \ they love to eat but what they truly love is music. We try out Waltzing Matilda,\
  \ with the help of a Youtube video with lyrics so all can sing along. They sing\
  \ me a traditional mountain song of the yak herders. \n\nWe clap the beat together,\
  \ communicating through the language of music better than our spoken words.\n\n\
  I'm back at the airport, the little prayer flags waving goodbye to me. Onwards I\
  \ go, to a solo adventure across the globe.\nI could not think of a more perfect\
  \ place to begin this journey than with you, Bhutan. \n\nYou taught me to see the\
  \ best in people. You proved that spirituality is something we live, not speak about.\
  \ You reminded me that strangers are friends we haven't made yet. Over the next\
  \ five months, believing in the goodness of others, I Couchsurfed across the world."
