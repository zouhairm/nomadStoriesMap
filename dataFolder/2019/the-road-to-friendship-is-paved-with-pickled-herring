Text: "\u201CThe forest comes right up to the beach,\u201D Ramona said as she drove\
  \ us to the Baltic Sea. She kept calling it by its German name, the Ostsee. This\
  \ was our first trip outside Berlin since my husband and I had moved to the city\
  \ two months earlier.\n    It was also our first car trip in two months and Ramona\
  \ sped up to 150 km/h to give us the full German Autobahn experience. Tall pines\
  \ with peeling orange-brown bark flashed by outside the window. They were spindly,\
  \ top-heavy trees whose branches only started two-thirds of the way up their trunks.\
  \ \n    \u201CThe beaches on the Ostsee,\u201D Ramona sighed. \u201CThat\u2019s\
  \ what I picture when I think of Germany.\u201D \n    What did I picture when I\
  \ thought of Germany? Berlin, because it was the only part of the country I\u2019\
  d visited. And Bavaria\u2014men in lederhosen and Alpine chalets\u2014because that\
  \ was the stereotypical image of German culture I\u2019d internalized growing up\
  \ in the US. Spending time with Ramona was quickly complicating my understanding\
  \ of what was typically German. \n    \u201CMmm, and you know what we\u2019re going\
  \ to do first, right?\u201D Ramona asked.\n    \u201CFischbr\xF6tchen?\u201D I said,\
  \ tripping over my pronunciation of the German ch. \n    \u201CLecker!\u201D She\
  \ replied. (Tasty!)\n    Fischbr\xF6tchen was Ramona\u2019s favorite food. The last\
  \ time she was at the Ostsee, she texted my husband and me a photo of it. We had\
  \ no idea what we were looking at because it\u2019s not the most attractive dish.\
  \ It\u2019s a fish sandwich, and, at its most basic, is a filet of lightly-pickled\
  \ herring and white onions on a roll. Often there\u2019s a remoulade and pickles,\
  \ too. Perhaps a leaf of lettuce. When Ramona first described fischbr\xF6tchen to\
  \ me, she was having trouble translating the ingredients. \n    We were sitting\
  \ on the lawn in front of the Berlin Cathedral eating ice cream. Berliners love\
  \ their green space, and the wide expanse of grass was packed with people enjoying\
  \ the spring sunshine. We were waiting for my husband to finish work and join us.\
  \ He was the only reason I knew Ramona, after all, and I was still getting used\
  \ to spending time with just her.\n    Ramona and my husband met when she was a\
  \ German exchange student at his high school. By chance, over a decade later, we\
  \ moved to Germany and got in touch with her. She was applying for work at the time,\
  \ happened to find a job in Berlin, and moved to the city a few weeks after us.\
  \ It all felt very serendipitous. And resulted in us getting to know each other\
  \ over ice cream and a discussion of traditional Northern German food. \n    \u201C\
  The fish is raw,\u201D Ramona said.\n    \u201CLike sushi?\u201D I wondered.\n \
  \   \u201CWell, it\u2019s\u2026 pickled, pickled herring? Is that the right word?\u201D\
  \n    \u201CI\u2019ve heard of pickled herring,\u201D I said. Although, most of\
  \ the time, I heard it used as an example of a gross, old-person food. \n    \u201C\
  It\u2019s soaked in vinegar?\u201D Ramona continued. \n    \u201CI mean\u2026 that\u2019\
  s pickling,\u201D I said. \n    \u201CIt\u2019s okay if you don\u2019t like it,\u201D\
  \ she assured me. \u201CBut it\u2019s my favorite food.\u201D When my husband joined\
  \ us, we told her we\u2019d be happy to try it. \n    And now, here we were, en\
  \ route to the Ostsee, ready to make good on our promise. Ramona took us to her\
  \ favorite place to get fischbr\xF6tchen, Fisch 13 in Greifswald. I wanted the full\
  \ experience, so, I copied her order: a pflaumen august. It was the classic fischbr\xF6\
  tchen with a twist: plum jam. Yup, pickled herring, raw onions, and plum jam on\
  \ a roll. Sounds delicious, right? \n    But it hardly mattered if it tasted good\
  \ or not. Ramona was showing us her Germany, and inviting us to make it ours. The\
  \ point was to try it, to embrace this friendship and this different understanding\
  \ of our new home.\n    I ate the whole thing."
