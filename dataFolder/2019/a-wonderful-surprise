Text: "I have always been curious and that is the main reason I love travelling: you\
  \ get to know different places, people, cultures and another yourself too. It is\
  \ a moment in life in which routine is put aside and everything becomes an adventure.\n\
  \n\nIt is impossible for a six-year old child to know all of it, but I remember\
  \ how much I had been wondering about the world beyond my little birthtown. \nAll\
  \ the questions I thought of got the answers during a normal day, all of a sudden.\
  \ My parents would go in Italy for a short period to work, leaving me and my four\
  \ year-old brother Robert in our grandparents\u2019 care. Then they would come back\
  \ in Roumania, with some gifts for us. At the beginning, I suffered from their absence,\
  \ but I knew we would stay all together in the end, so the pain faded.\nThe last\
  \ time they came back in Roumania though, they told us we would all go to Italy\
  \ during the summertime.\nI was over the moon and my imagination flew up high, without\
  \ limits, thinking about this unusual place.\nIn the end, we left our home and I\
  \ leapt in the unknown in a bright summer day.\nI cannot remember much about my\
  \ first plane journey, thinking about the next future. What comes up very clearly\
  \ to my mind is the moment after the landing. \nIn fact, there were my mother\u2019\
  s friend, Graziella, and her two daughters, of my brother\u2019s age, waiting for\
  \ us.\nThey have been the first Italian people I got in touch with. What struck\
  \ me was their physical appearance: I had imagined Italians as blond and fair-skinned\
  \ people, whereas they were quite small and dark-skinned. I was a bit anxious because\
  \ of my shyness, but their smile and warmness made me feel better.\n\nI am sure\
  \ the girls were looking forward to seeing me and my brother, because they immediately\
  \ asked our names.\nI could not catch a word of Italian, so I did not answer. However,\
  \ the younger between the two thought I was not able to hear her. So, she came very\
  \ close to me and articulated the sentence very slowly and very loudly too. I tried\
  \ to make my mum translate it, but she was not listening. \nThe little one went\
  \ on speaking and she mimed her words too. At that time, I thought she was a bit\
  \ crazy, even though I laugh about it all now. \nEventually, mum explained me everything\
  \ and the conversation kept on going. Since then, I made an effort to learn as much\
  \ Italian as I could to be able to speak. \nGraziella took us to her home to eat\
  \ with them and after that we went home. It was little and with the basic furniture,\
  \ but mum made it cosy.\nThe following days were quite strange, because many things\
  \ were new to me and completely unknown. First of all, pasta.\nIt took me quite\
  \ a lot to eat it without bread, which is served in Roumania with almost everything.\
  \ Anyway, I learned to love every kind of pasta, as well as Italian cooking, full\
  \ of genuine flavours.\nApart from food, another surprise, which took away my breath,\
  \ was sea.\nI saw it two days after my arrival and I went with mom, Robert, Graziella\
  \ and her daughters.\nThe cold, salty water and the gentle breeze all along the\
  \ shore were a relief in the hot and dry summer air. The soft sand under our beach\
  \ towels and the big coloured umbrella above us are sweet memories of an unforgettable\
  \ day.\nSea was also a challenge for me, unable to swim and that day I put my legs\
  \ in the water. I learned little by little every day, facing my fear to drown, until\
  \ I swam like a little fish at the end of the summer.\nThat summer Robert and I\
  \ have got two new friends: Graziella\u2019s daughters and this friendship was going\
  \ to last.\nIn fact, at the end of the summer I found out I was going to live in\
  \ Italy forever.\nBut that is another story\u2026"
