Text: "Last year in the middle of grand hotel adorned with chandeliers hanging down\
  \ in a cascading light of shimmering crystals i noticed an old man, well there were\
  \ plenty but he seemed to be full of wisdom. His skin sagging around his neck, his\
  \ hair white or was it gray, i couldn't tell because of the lighting in the ball\
  \ room where we were received to be introduced to our families in a home-stay style\
  \ of getting to know Japan and its cultures. \nHe was short, always smiling and\
  \ had a bald spot he had this Saint Nicholas look. I like him immediately. \nOne\
  \ night  and a day was hardly enough, i was more interested in being immersed into\
  \ it head first using all tools imaginable to the human ability. I had to settle\
  \ for the home-stay. \n\nHe smiled at us shook our hand and hugged us, he spoke\
  \ in short brief sentences, an architect who was part of the reconstruction process\
  \ of the city in ruins after the nuclear devastation at Hiroshima.   \n\nWhat is\
  \ your name? he asked me and what does it mean? Welcome to Japan, i do not bite!\
  \ he would always throw jokes into the conversation unexpectedly. Hilarious little\
  \ jokes he would throw when least expected. \n\n''Japan Post war reconstruction'\
  \ was his presentation, he did it with a tone that was somber yet reassuring and\
  \ with promise and glitter in his eyes that said \"it will be well\" subliminally.\
  \ My family all died, as he scrolled through his presentation, my sister, my friends,\
  \ my parents, i was young......he kept narrating as the black and white photos were\
  \ projected onto the screen his melancholy voice carried me off into the story,\
  \ i drifted and teared until i looked around the room only to realize i wasn't the\
  \ only one.\n\nHis story of resilience, his building designs and constructed structures,\
  \ he says he will always be proud off because he contributed to the development\
  \ of his community in a way that will let his legacy remain for generations to enjoy\
  \ and know that it is possible. \n\nThat morning we set off to Miyajima island.\
  \ The ferry was cold, wet, just like the weather that day.  The clouds grey and\
  \ threatening, showers trickeld down on our head. We arrived, the smell of sea food\
  \ grilled, boiled or roasted, made no difference it made me sick to the pit of my\
  \ stomach but i was sure it smelt like a piece of heaven to its locals. Our host\
  \ gathered us around refusing to let us join the larger group he took us on a trail\
  \ up the island that allowed us to actually mingle and talk with the locals and\
  \ we even dined in a Japanese style restaurant on a green tea and rice cake snack\
  \ that send my taste buds protesting in refusal over the lack of a sense of salt\
  \ or sweetness that i was used to, i had to embrace this experience i thought while\
  \ my colleagues bawled down in laughter at my bland expression. Our host was gracious\
  \ to laugh along but kept encouraging me to keep being adventurous and try out new\
  \ thing. 'its good for the soul would he would say!\" \nWhen the stay was over he\
  \ said i know you feel helpless but do something anything it goes a long way. \"\
  \ i wish all the best. While hugging onto his cane and dear wife.\n\nHis disposition\
  \ always threw me off, he was always jolly, and very concerned. I still keep his\
  \ beautiful  photo looking into the distance over a flight of stairs on the Island\
  \ that on a backdrop of beautiful statues."
