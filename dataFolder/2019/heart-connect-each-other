Text: "Local people was so nice. I was joined a summer camp activity in Kamareddy\
  \ about 160km from Hyderabad in South India. First time visit this country and came\
  \ as a volunteer of english teacher for 2 weeks summer camp. \n\nMeeting local people\
  \ was always nice.. some of them didn't speak English but we still try to communicate\
  \ with body language. Even when asking for public toilet.. we need to discuss it\
  \ about more than minute. \n\nGoing through school activities not just story telling,\
  \ drawing and playing football. Join the local marketing activity was so superb!\
  \ They go to sururb area which locate about 20-50km from the school. \n\nFirst they\
  \ keep looking at me, like i am alien! I think there is no other tourist before\
  \ me. As i look a bit Chinese, their mimic told me like wow! you are different from\
  \ us! who are you? I just keep calm and smile as much as i can :)\n\nI try to connect\
  \ with them by smiling and shaking my head like what many indian does. Try to say\
  \ hello in English. We took Jeep into more sururb area.. Most child didn't go to\
  \ school. They play in the ground some of them play just in front of their house.\
  \ Olders gather along together with happy face.\n\nSuddenly realized that happy\
  \ just as simple as daily life. I follow some of them to marketing their school\
  \ into local parents, educate them to send their kids with us. \n\nI think 38 degrees\
  \ at that time we go around the local houses.. only few kids speak English and they\
  \ are warm welcoming me. Keep trying to talk something with me. Some asking for\
  \ photos as well.\n\nOne suburb moving to other suburb take around 1 hour. Lunch\
  \ time, we look for a big trees, get off from the jeep, sit on the mat, take out\
  \ all the food we have, eating together as usual with hands :) So memorable to forget\
  \ that happiness is such a simple thing.\n\nWe keep moving around the suburb area\
  \ till afternoon.. man go to work in the field and woman stay in the house with\
  \ kids and olders. A lot of cows in the street and if they cross the road, our jeep\
  \ need to stop. Because cow represent God, so common people must pay respect for\
  \ them.\n\nTime flies as my summer camp life is come to the end. That part was just\
  \ amazing, we can connect even with language barrier. Sometime heart is work, we\
  \ know each other through it.\n\nI learned how to draw henna, i know how to write\
  \ my name in Telugu, dance with traditional songs, wearing kurthi and sari!! So\
  \ different from modern lifestyle but it worth! .. and so far what is the most important\
  \ thing? they serve vegetarian foods everywhere!! Love the small little green mark\
  \ which mean vegetarian meat free products!\n\nI hope all of you enjoy my short\
  \ story here. It was so nice to keep talking with people with different language\
  \ and know their culture. Good thing if you getting to know local people and adapt\
  \ with their daily life. Such an experience!!"
