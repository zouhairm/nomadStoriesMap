Text: "This is the best feeling ever! What have I been missing out for the past 2\
  \ years.\n\nThat was the first time I flew out of my state uttarakhand , and the\
  \ first trip with friends.\n\nA trip that changed my life.\n\nBefore that last minute\
  \ trip (we made the decision a day ago), I\u2019ve never given much thought to travelling.\n\
  \nThroughout my childhood, I\u2019ve travelled probably once a year with my mum\
  \ and uncle, staying in the nearby regions of uttarakhand.\n\nUntil 2011, when I\
  \ was called to serve the nation and my precious annual leave were saved for whatever\
  \ activities a 16-year-old thought were cool.\n\nOh boy, what a bad choice. I never\
  \ knew what I gave up.\n\nNo travels. No exploration..\n\nTurning Point\nSince that\
  \ gwalior trip in 2012, I\u2019ve caught the travel bug and been in and out of uttarakhand\
  \ seven times each year for the next two years.\n\nThe two craziest years of my\
  \ life - striking off item after item on my bucket list, meeting people from all\
  \ over the India and pushing myself out of my comfort zone.\n\nI\u2019ve jumped\
  \ out of the bus and woundering that place and took lunch in a beatiful resto and\
  \ go ahead for boating which is held on the lake of kashipur of uddam singh nagar\
  \ district. I enjoyed the 4 days in kashipur too much."
