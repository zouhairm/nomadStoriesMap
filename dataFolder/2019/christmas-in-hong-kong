Text: "Christmas night and I was lying in bed in a small hotel room in downtown Hong\
  \ Kong with my 80-year old grandmother.  It was late but I could still hear sounds\
  \ from people celebrating in the streets below. I looked over to my grandmother\u2019\
  s side of the bed and she was already fast asleep. It had been a long and eventful\
  \ day for her. \n\nFirst trip abroad, something she had wanted to do all her life.\
  \ A dream she kept putting off because of her seven kids, a full-time teaching career,\
  \ and babysitting some of her grandchildren after retirement. But she never stopped\
  \ talking about it and so when the opportunity came, I booked a 3-day trip for the\
  \ two of us to go to Hong Kong. It seemed like a great idea at that time, tickets\
  \ were cheaper to fly on Christmas Eve, and it was only a short flight from our\
  \ island in the Philippines. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t anticipate was the sheer number\
  \ of people, locals and tourists, who were also in Hong Kong for the holidays. My\
  \ grandmother lived in a small coastal town most of her life and I was afraid it\
  \ would overwhelm her. All the colors, flashing neon signs, navigating public transportation,\
  \ and walking on crowded streets. \n\nBut she loved it all. Like a wild-eyed child,\
  \ she took everything in. We rode the famous tram to Victoria\u2019s Peak and marveled\
  \ at the panoramic views of Hong Kong\u2019s skyline. She had \u201Cfancy\u201D\
  \ coffee at Starbucks and was shocked at how expensive it was. I took pictures of\
  \ her standing in front of luxury boutiques so she could show it to her church ladies\
  \ back home. We explored the busy street markets of Mong Kok, where merchants kept\
  \ pulling on her arm, asking her to buy fake designer handbags and perfumes.\n \n\
  And like every other Filipino mom I know, she bargained hard until she got the price\
  \ she wanted. It was all done with hand gestures and head shakes because the store\
  \ owners barely spoke English. My grandmother would pretend to walk away and they\
  \ would call her back, offered a lower price using their calculators, back and forth,\
  \ until finally she got what she was willing to pay for. It was quiet an interesting\
  \ exchange and I was so proud of her. \n\nLater we attended an evening mass at St.\
  \ John\u2019s Cathedral. Even if the mass was mostly in Cantonese and I hardly went\
  \ to church anymore, something about sharing the familiar rituals with my grandmother,\
  \ the smell of incense, and the choir singing \u201CO Holy Night\u201D brought tears\
  \ to my eyes. \n\nAfter mass we waited for the bus that will take us back to our\
  \ hotel, only to find out it ran on limited service because it was Christmas Day.\
  \ There were no taxis in sight, so I decided that we walk to the closest train station,\
  \ which was half a mile away. I was too busy looking at my map to make sure we were\
  \ on the right street, that I didn\u2019t notice my grandmother was already walking\
  \ slower. And then she said, \u201CI don\u2019t think I can keep walking.\u201D\
  \ \n\nI was filled with guilt and fear. What if something were to happen to her\
  \ while we were in a foreign country? I kept saying \u201CI\u2019m so sorry\u201D\
  , and she apologized for slowing us down, which made me feel even more guilty. \n\
  \nI remembered my first day in Kindergarten. How I cried so hard and refused to\
  \ go back to the classroom after recess. My grandmother was teaching sixth grade\
  \ at the same school and they had to call her over because I was inconsolable. I\
  \ don\u2019t recall the details but I remembered holding on to her so tight while\
  \ she talked me into walking back to class.\n\nAnd there I was, many years later,\
  \ holding on to her tightly just like when I was little. We found a bench where\
  \ she could sit and rest. All around us were twinkling lights and people trying\
  \ to go somewhere. We stayed there for a while, before walking hand in hand again,\
  \ to find the train station."
