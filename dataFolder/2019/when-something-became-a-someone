Text: "Legend says that there is a hidden treasure in Brazil. To find it, you have\
  \ to be a little crazy; choose Curitiba over Rio, Sao Paulo or any other typical\
  \ place. Then, ring the bell of a place called Casa Brasileira.\n\nI lived there\
  \ for five months and I can assure you this place doesn\u2019t exist. It is unreal,\
  \ full of extraordinary characters and situations: some of them fly, some fall in\
  \ love, language loses its meaning, and yet those who arrive, will find an own way\
  \ of communicating. I can definitively guarantee that each character that arrives\
  \ there, will be transformed.\n\nYou have to be really careful.\n\nYou can\u2019\
  t go there if you want to maintain your identity, it its highly probable that you\
  \ absorb so much that you cease to be the person you were before entering the Casa\
  \ Brasileira.\n\nThe randomness of life can lead you to that house, but if you can\
  \ control yourself, do not enter there, go on with your life, do not look back,\
  \ do not ask yourself what could have happened there, for God\u2019s sake, go away.\
  \ Because they say that one or two fools entered there, and when they left, they\
  \ lost a part of themselves, they changed, they weren\u2019t themselves since that\
  \ day. But anyone you\u2019d ask, will not regret having stepped on the wooden floor\
  \ of the Casa Brasileira.\n\nCasa Brasileira is a house of students at first, but\
  \ the more you live there, the more you realize that is not a something but it is\
  \ a someone. It is someone a little bit old, brown-skinned, red head, huge, a little\
  \ bit dirty, reliable, trustworthy and very wise.\n\nWith Casa Brasileira I learnt\
  \ Portuguese, a little bit of French and a little bit of Italian. Also I learnt\
  \ that moments have their date of expiry, moments are finite. I will always remember\
  \ the times I was with Casa Brasileira, laughing, dancing, drinking, having the\
  \ moment of my life, with an Italian in front of me, a French by my side, in the\
  \ other extreme a Brazilian dancing and two Spanish playing ping pong in the distance.\n\
  \nI did not expect to find out that even though we were from different cultures,\
  \ different religions and different languages, we all understood each other when\
  \ we were at the Casa. Everything and everyone was connected, everything made sense:\
  \ Brazilian music, the flag colors, the shoes that were hanged on the wall, the\
  \ red lights that illuminated the barbecue. Casa Brasileira erase all borders, there\u2019\
  s no race there, no language barrier. Every gap that could separate us, Casa Brasileira\
  \ didn\u2019t care about it, and unite us as one.\n\nIn the streets you can hear\
  \ some people saying that the house, was just a simple anti-hygienic place where\
  \ you\u2019ll get a disease, and those who live there will only interact with each\
  \ other. \u201DThey have another language\u201D, \u201Cthey do not go out from there\u201D\
  . The truth is that you can go to R\xEDo de Janeiro, Foz de Iguaz\xFA, Sao Paulo,\
  \ Bah\xEDa, but if you didn\u2019t find the hidden treasure of Casa Brasileira in\
  \ Curitiba, I won\u2019t believe that you have lived the real Brazilian experience."
