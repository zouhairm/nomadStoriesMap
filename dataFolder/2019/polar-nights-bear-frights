Text: "\u201CVlad!\u201D \nThe group halted as our hiking guide, Katya, waded through\
  \ the knee-deep snow to confer with guide number two. I followed the direction of\
  \ their gazes and leaned in, nervously trying to pick up the tone of their conversation.\
  \ \u201CI thought I saw... that could be... no, probably not.\u201D Katya turned\
  \ around and chirpily addressed the group. \u201CWe thought maybe we would meet\
  \ the bears just now, but we think it\u2019s probably just some deer. Shall we continue?\u201D\
  \ \nI found myself nodding feebly as I looked again in the direction Katya had been\
  \ pointing. We had left the town lights of Longyearbyen behind us and what stretched\
  \ ahead was a seemingly infinite tundra of ice and snow. The heavy snowfall made\
  \ land indistinguishable from sky and although it was somewhere around noon, the\
  \ polar night cast us in constant pitch-black darkness. It was hard not to imagine\
  \ how ridiculously easy it would be for a two hundred kilo polar bear to hurtle\
  \ from the shadows and pick off a member of the group for lunch. \n\n\u201CYou will\
  \ protect us, won\u2019t you Nina?\u201D Vlad asked our reluctant guide dog as we\
  \ prepared to continue trekking. She looked up at him, dolefully. \u201CShe says\
  \ she wants to go back to bed,\u201D someone said. Everyone laughed. \n\u201CHa.\u201D\
  \ I tried, and failed, to join in. \n\nBy this point in my trip, worrying about\
  \ a polar bear attack didn\u2019t feel like neurosis \u2014 it was totally justified.\
  \ It was my second day in Svalbard and every interaction with a local so far had\
  \ included a cheerful warning along the lines of: \u201CPolar bear and two cubs\
  \ somewhere about. Don\u2019t know where they are now. Be careful!\u201D \nAlthough\
  \ this information had sent me into a tailspin of increasingly violent and biopic-worthy\
  \ visions of death-by-bear, it had not come as a total shock to hear. At around\
  \ 78\xB0north and just over one thousand kilometres from the North Pole, the Norwegian\
  \ archipelago of Svalbard is well and truly arctic. Polar bears come with the territory,\
  \ and I couldn\u2019t deny that the possibility of meeting one in the wild thrilled\
  \ me as much as it terrified me.\nKeen for an adventure in the wilderness of the\
  \ far north I was more surprised to discover just how accessible Svalbard really\
  \ was. I flew into Spitsbergen airport by budget airline, booked activities a few\
  \ days in advance on my phone and even slept amongst fellow backpackers at a cheap\
  \ youth hostel. As my husky-sledding guide, an Australian named Tanya, pointed out:\
  \ Svalbard offers something to visitors that people seem to crave. \u201CSome will\
  \ try to live here and the darkness, the cold \u2014 it\u2019s too much,\u201D she\
  \ told me. \u201CBut lots of people fall in love with it. I came here for a week-long\
  \ holiday and now I\u2019ve been here for two years.\u201D\n\nOn my final night\
  \ in Svalbard, I sat disappointed in the hostel. After one cancelled flight and\
  \ three nights of wind and snow, the final blow had just been delivered to my dream\
  \ of seeing the aurora borealis. In a last-ditch show of optimism I had booked a\
  \ \u201CChasing the Northern Lights\u201D bus tour, only to be informed that the\
  \ bus was now unfortunately buried in snow. There would be no chasing tonight. \n\
  Just I was preparing to wallow in self-pity, one of my dorm mates, Laina, burst\
  \ through the door. \n\u201CI\u2019ve seen them!\u201D she cried. \u201CThe lights!\u201D\
  \nAs Laina hurriedly warmed up with a mug of instant coffee, I threw on several\
  \ extra layers of clothing and soon we were out the door. A hundred metres from\
  \ the hostel the lights of the town dropped away and the elusive aurora borealis\
  \ was suddenly there before our eyes. For forty minutes we watched the green lights\
  \ drift and dance across the sky until they slowly melted away. Staring into the\
  \ sky at what was now just fog, I understood the appeal of living in darkness and\
  \ ice; there was something magically freeing about mother nature\u2019s total obliviousness\
  \ to our presence. I shifted my gaze into the blackness surrounding us, thinking\
  \ again of polar bears. \n\u201CI think I\u2019ll go back to the hostel now.\u201D"
