Text: "While I can't write about the time I've seen a fashion show in Milan, or the\
  \ time I performed a sacred ritual in Japan with a couple of Monks.. I can say I\
  \ have seen a bit of convivial locations in my lifetime.. The strangest part of\
  \ all? I didn't have to travel outside my home country to experience them! \n  Now,\
  \ living in the US, most people have traveled down into the magical tourist triangle,\
  \ that is: Central Florida. Lots of shops, theme parks, resorts, golfing and best\
  \ of all.. The insane amount of tourism and overall citizens! However, I can't complain,\
  \ I had the most unique time living there for roughly 6 months. Also, after the\
  \ short time there, I met a wide range of those people! From many different cultures\
  \ and races. Being from New Jersey, I'm used to many different cultures, from visiting\
  \ New York.. But it was a bit more personal in Florida.\n There was a time I stayed\
  \ down at a resort with my family. We were already living in the area, but it was\
  \ my sister's birthday. We wanted her to have a unique experience! We stayed at\
  \ the Nickelodeon Hotel & Resort. It's a neat little place. Lots of games, two water\
  \ parks, private clubs exclusive for tweens and up, great food options, etc. Anyway..\
  \ One day I was hanging at the pool after playing with my younger siblings, when\
  \ I decided to go check out the slime area. I stayed close to my family, being only\
  \ about 11 years old at the time, but I wanted to mingle and meet some new kids..\
  \ So I ventured out a little into the deeper section of the swimming pool. I came\
  \ across a young girl, maybe a few years younger than me. She seemed kind of lonely,\
  \ so I tried talking to her. She didn't say much but body language back, but I figured\
  \ it was due to the loud music.. She just smiled, and signaled for me to swim with\
  \ her. We did a few dives and games of tag, before her father stood at the edge\
  \ of the pool, yelling over to her to \"get out\".. Except one thing, it wasn't\
  \ in English. I felt so stupid! I didn't realize that infact, her and her family\
  \ were from eastern Mexico and indeed spoke mostly in Spanish. All I could think\
  \ of to say were words like, \"Adi\xF3s\" or \"\xBFC\xF3mo est\xE1s?\".. The words\
  \ I've learned in elementary school. But when I ready to say them, she was gone.\n\
  \ Some time past, before I was later playing basketball in the arcade.. And kept\
  \ thinking about how to talk to \"the girl\" (as I yet don't know her name), and\
  \ try to remember the light Spanish I knew. After awhile, I started to get bored\
  \ of the same games, and decided to take off to get together with my family for\
  \ dinner. On the way there, I tripped over a toy on the floor. When I started to\
  \ fix myself, I was lended a hand from above me. It was the young girl again.. This\
  \ time, she spoke to me! She said, \"I apologize for earlier, my dad told me I should've\
  \ said a goodbye. I wanted to.. I'm just really shy.\". And I being naive, stupidly\
  \ asked the question, \"You speak English, I thought you-\". She giggled. The girl,\
  \ now with a name, Isabella, went on about how her it was her family's first time\
  \ in America. She had been studying English from watching her favorite shows in\
  \ Spanish on (get this), Nickolodeon, with English subtitles! Her family weren't\
  \ as fluent as she was, but tried to say as much as they could remember from hearing\
  \ others. I made a new group of friends that day (and picked up some Espa\xF1ol)!\n\
  \ While I haven't seen Isabella or her family since the visit to the hotel, I have\
  \ kept that experience with me forever. I noticed how many people were actually\
  \ foreign in Florida. A lot of those \"tourists\", became a huge learning opportunity\
  \ for me to grow culturally.. And that is now why I want to learn and travel, indefinitely!"
