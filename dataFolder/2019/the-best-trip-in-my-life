Text: "Date of Trip: August 2010\n\nThe Best Trip in My life!!!\n\nI\u2019m happy\
  \ to tell you about my trip Swat KPK Pakistan. We travel as a group of 8, and every\
  \ year we go to a different place. Money permitting, we love to travel, but we tend\
  \ to stay away from organized tours in the usual sense of the word since so often\
  \ they tend to protect from really getting into the places, skipping from one tourist\
  \ attraction to the next. This year we decided to go to Swat KPK Pakistan, mainly\
  \ because it seemed inexpensive, but after the vacation, we were definitely in love\
  \ with the place.\n\nWe flew into  Sawet and were impressed immediately upon arrival\
  \ by the airport building: its incredible roof outside is like lace and the sun\
  \ shines through it, casting beautiful shadows on the pavement: there already was\
  \ an incredible atmosphere greeting us. We took a taxi for 6 (a minivan) and for\
  \ 500 Pakistani rupess with hundreds of scooters speeding around us! Our hotel was\
  \ right off the Kumrat Valley \u2013 orderly chaos of smells, colors and sounds,\
  \ by day and into the night! We hadn\u2019t yet learned to not fall for taking pictures\
  \ of guys with Cobras (after you do they demand money), but that is how it started!\
  \ We spent 2 days in Kumrat Valley visiting the traditional tourist destinations\
  \ before we were met by the travel guides that we had selected for the real tour\
  \ and said. From the outset, we found Hassan an incredible person, full of joy,\
  \ outgoing, but never intrusive.\n\nWe left  Kumrat Valley where we visited the\
  \ Mahodand Lake and then off to Bahrain. Here we stayed in a hotel built in the\
  \ caves! How wonderful! If you want I can give you its name. The next legs of our\
  \ trip were the classic ones: Erfoud, Merzouga, Rissani, Zagora, and Ouarzazate:\
  \ you can do them with any tour operator, but what we experienced is unforgettable.\
  \ At Erfoud we had lunch at home with Hassan\u2019s family: What a welcome! We ate\
  \ couscous the way they make it and drank REAL mint tea, his sister\u2019s friends\
  \ were doing henna tattoos, and did it to us, too. The next evening we headed for\
  \ a desert oasis on camels, to spend the night in a Berber tent distinctly counting\
  \ every star in the Milky Way (well, almost all). How can we forget, while at his\
  \ family\u2019s home, how Roger \u2018vomited\u2019 from having drunk milk in his\
  \ morning coffee?!?!? But that mishap actually led to an interesting experience!\
  \ Hassan \u2018s mother massaged special points of Roger\u2019s wrists and feet\
  \ with \u2018magic\u2019 oil, and incredibly, somehow, after a quarter of an hour,\
  \ Roger was good as new.\n\nAnd how can we forget our stop on the way to Malam Jabba,\
  \ stopping to take a picture, when suddenly 2 children leaped out from nowhere offering\
  \ a pony made of mud, they had made with their hands, in exchange for some candy!\
  \ And when they accompanied us through the tiny dark inner passageways of a small\
  \ town in the south, revealing the meaning of poverty, enabling us to quietly and\
  \ respectfully peek into the everyday life of people. And how can we forget our\
  \ lunch, eating Berber pizza, in a small rug factory, sitting in the midst of all\
  \ those dancing colors and so many types of fabric! I could go on for hours recounting\
  \ the feelings, more than the places we visited. Thanks to Hassan(organizing everything\
  \ down to details like cool drinking water, snacks, SD cards for my camera and making\
  \ us always feel safe in places that are so strange to us in culture and language)\
  \ and to said, who, though silent and not speaking our language and understanding\
  \ little, was an incredible and fun travelling companion.\n\nFeelings, understanding\
  \ the land and the people of the Swat we are visiting are what we seek when we travel\
  \ and that is definitely what we got this time."
