Text: "Dear Isaac,\nMy old classmate- it has been seven years since the last time\
  \ I saw you. You're sitting in the police car parked outside our school in handcuffs.\
  \ We hardly know each other, come to think about it we never spoke. I will never\
  \ understand why you did what you did to me. But I want you to know if you knew\
  \ what I was thinking in that moment, you would have kept your hands to yourself.\
  \ Darkness and confusion invade my life, I can not forget that haunting look in\
  \ your eye. An overwhelming force consumes my heart spitting anger, guilt, and denial\
  \ toward every humanly encounter that comes my way. Broken and covered in filth\
  \ I lay down my life to a mysterious sense of light. With no proof, I trust the\
  \ empty air and enter a mysterious journey of pain and love. I am chained to the\
  \ hurt you have caused me and the pounding in my head does not stop. Over and over\
  \ I long for comfort, over and over I long for healing. Over and over I terminate\
  \ you from existence in my head. All I want to do is hurt you, but I am taught \"\
  Forgive us our tresspasses as we forgive those who trespass against us.\" So I am\
  \ writing this letter to you Isaac, to tell you, if you knew what I was thinking\
  \ right now in this moment.\nIt is okay. I forgive you.  \nSincerely,\nMichelle"
