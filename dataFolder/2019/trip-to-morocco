Text: "Many cities in the world are many diverse, colourful and different, but Moroccan\
  \ cities keep their own charm as the cities of history, tradition, originality,\
  \ civilization and uniqueness in handicrafts.\nIt is not possible to visit all the\
  \ beautiful cities of Morocco in one trip\n\nThat's why I signed My choice (Casablanca,\
  \ Rabat, Marrakech, Fez). It was not a random choice, but it meant these cities\
  \ precisely because they are colorful cities. Casablanca by its position lying on\
  \ the chest of the Atlantic Ocean, the sea gave it the colour of its blue gown,\
  \ earning it beauty above its beauty, and Rabat, which became the capital of the\
  \ state in the late 20th century where the capital was in Fez\nThe sea overlooks\
  \ it with its blue gown, although it leans on its shoulder! But she was spinning\
  \ from the peasant, her gown is bright and beautiful.\n\nMarrakech was in it for\
  \ its red soil, spinning its gown and weaving it from the soil of the desert  \"\
  Blessed \" color, an inner city called the red City  \". The city of Fez, the White\
  \ City, is the most characteristic of the whiteness of its houses, which climb the\
  \ Atlas mountains so seems thee that it will retreat and fall on its face from the\
  \ steep slope of the Atlas Mountains\n\nThen we arrived in a city next to Meknes,only\
  \ a few food shops, while the rest of it is forgiven in a deep sleep a few hours\
  \ earlier, and in that it is not much different from its twins on the other side\
  \ of Meknes, soon we went to the highway, and it was a darkness that only reflected\
  \ the light from the searchlight. On the side of the road, the driver exchanged\
  \ the edges of the conversation with the \"Walid \", and the latter resists drowsiness\
  \ with great difficulty, while I succumbed to him completely and did not wake him\
  \ until we stopped in front of a small building, found in the dark scarcely a plate\
  \ on his entrance bearing his name  \"Hotel Mall Idrees  \", see on the opposite\
  \ side a high rocky plateau while the road climbs west of the hotel to further heights\
  \ knock at 3:00 in the morning, while our hands knock on the glass window of the\
  \ door of the hotel, a short man Bedouin of the features I drove on a sofa in the\
  \ hotel lounge to open the door, he  Walid reminded him of the reservation and asks\
  \ us about our late smiling at the idle sleeper and handing us the keys.\nWe go\
  \ upstairs to our opposite room on the first round. Waking up dates for the next\
  \ day, and each of us defends the stones in a hurry, small is our room with two\
  \ small beds, a clean medium sized bathroom, and there was a high-volume square\
  \ device that settles in one of the corners, and comes out of a tube revolving next\
  \ to the walls of the room Returns to connect again to the box device.\nAt 8:30,\
  \ we were ready to go. I think the eagerness to see new places, providing us with\
  \ an inexhaustible reservoir of adrenaline, helps us in turn to endure the hardships\
  \ and continuous activity for many days, we went out to the street and we stood\
  \ in front of looking for a taxi, but my friend Walid decided to leave Walk to see\
  \ the beautiful city, before traveling to the city of Fes\n\nThe city was full of\
  \ history, and the magnificent Islamic monuments, after more than five hours of\
  \ walking, we decided to draw our strength from a Moroccan food meal, and fortunately\
  \ we found a restaurant nearby, suggesting its appearance that from the last century,\
  \ with a beautiful Moroccan d\xE9cor,came a middle-aged man with the mango written\
  \ in French language and We can not read it we asked him to bring a Moroccan couscous\
  \ meal\nThe beauty and uniqueness of Fez's Antique city has been included in the\
  \ UNESCO World Heritage List. It has also been characterized by the originality\
  \ and authenticity of various handicraft and handicrafts industries. All artisan\
  \ schools are located in Fes."
