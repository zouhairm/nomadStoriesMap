Text: "I need to pack, probably pack light cause that\u2019s what they say. Flight\
  \ leaves at 740 in the morning Bwi airport and I can\u2019t be any more excited\
  \ for it. Some of the blood that flows through my veins came from Poland. I get\
  \ to up drive up and wait to board the plane. People yell and yell \u201Cit\u2019\
  s just to early for all that\u201D, as I think that I\u2019m my head there is a\
  \ fight that breaks loose and it gets hectic \u201Cwhy in a airport\u201D they tell\
  \ me to board quickly and I do of course. The flight was long but I slept through\
  \ it and made sure to not get traveling sickness. I land 25 hours later in KRK airport,\
  \ and right off the get go it looked so amazing it was so stunning, the buildings\
  \ were amazing. There was one big problem I don\u2019t know the language and I need\
  \ to convert my money and I\u2019m not sure how to do that I\u2019ve only flown\
  \ domestic. So I looked on my phone to find places to take money out of and use\
  \ as cash. I travel around looking up hotels places to eat because I am famished\
  \ for sure, but I go to a bank and deposit money and I was so thankful. I ride over\
  \ to a fine hotel called \u201CINX design hotel\u201D it\u2019s very nice and cheap\
  \ for how good it is it surprised but of course I didn\u2019t understand a word\
  \ the desk man was saying. We went back and forth and I finally got to a truse with\
  \ him it was annoying but I actually kinda liked it in a way it was fun. Got to\
  \ my room unpacked my book bag and I just payed on the bed thinking and thinking\
  \ what am I going to do now. I\u2019m in a foreign country, don\u2019t know the\
  \ language, and I\u2019m all alone. *Knock Knock Knock* there was someone at the\
  \ door. Got up drained and dragged my feet to the door I opened it and it was a\
  \ beautiful woman. \u201COh I\u2019m sorry I thought you were my friends room.\u201D\
  \ She spoke English but she most definitely had a polish accent. \u201C no no you\u2019\
  re fine\u201DI said very nervous. \u201C well I will not bother you no more mister\u201D\
  \ she said embarrassed, not sure why tho. \u201CNo wait uh so uh I\u2019m not really\
  \ from here, Poland ha so uh would you have any time maybe get a coffee and tell\
  \ me the ins and out of this place maybe cause you know English obviously (chuckled)\u201D\
  \ I said holding myself from shaking the whole hotel down to the ground. \u201C\
  Actually yes I would be glad to, see I\u2019ll give you my phone number is this\
  \ okay\u201D she said gleefully \u201CYES that is very okay I will be happy to call\
  \ when I need a tour guide\u201D I said with my heart popping out of my dang chest.\
  \ \u201C You better(laughs beautifully)\u201D she says and walks away skipping and\
  \ I close my door, my heart pounding, my palms sweating, knees weak, I\u2019m thinking\
  \ in my head what if we get married and as I am clenched on to the door of my hotel\
  \ room I say \u201CI didn\u2019t expect to find her\u201D"
