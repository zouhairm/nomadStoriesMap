Text: "THE MITIGATION MEASURES OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND HOW AFRICAN CAN LEAN\n\nClimate\
  \ change is an important global issue. Without action to reduce global greenhouse\
  \ gas emissions, global warming is likely to exceed 2\xB0C above pre-industrialised\
  \ levels, and could even be as much as 5\xB0C by the end of the century. This would\
  \ have a huge impact on the world's landscape and sea levels. \n\nThe story will\
  \ help review the 2030 climate and energy framework, The 2030 climate and energy\
  \ framework sets out a policy framework for EU climate and energy policies in the\
  \ 2020-2030 period. It contains a number of measures and targets to make the EU's\
  \ economy and energy system more competitive, secure and sustainable. The framework\
  \ also aims to encourage investment in green technologies, which would help create\
  \ jobs and strengthen Europe's competitiveness. the story will help give what African\
  \ can copy from the framework, how some of the EU countries are implementing such\
  \ framework, thew importance of the framework, impart of the framework on African.\n\
  \n2. EU ETS and its reform, The EU's emissions trading scheme (EU ETS) was set up\
  \ to promote the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions in a cost-effective and economically\
  \ efficient way. It restricts the volume of greenhouse gases that can be emitted\
  \ by certain industrial sectors. Emission allowances are capped at a level set by\
  \ the EU, and companies either receive or buy individual allowances. \n\nThe economic\
  \ crisis has lowered demand for these allowances, which has contributed to the build-up\
  \ of a large market surplus. To address this, the Council and the European Parliament\
  \ recently adopted a decision to create a market stability reserve for the EU ETS.\
  \ The market stability reserve aims to make the scheme more resilient to imbalances\
  \ between supply and demand of emission allowances. It will be established in 2018\
  \ and operate from 1 January 2019 onwards. So the story will help explain such policies,\
  \ what areas can Africa learn, the implementation and how the policies can help\
  \ Africa fight climate change on as global point of view.\n\nThe Commission has\
  \ also presented a proposal for a broad review of the EU ETS. The aim is to ensure\
  \ it remains the most efficient and cost-effective way to cut the EU's emissions\
  \ during the next decade. The  proposal is also the first concrete legislative step\
  \ towards implementing the EU's commitment to reducing greenhouse gas emissions\
  \ by at least 40% domestically by 2030.\n\n3. International agreements on climate\
  \ change, The global nature of climate change means that cooperation and action\
  \ at international level is important. The EU has therefore helped to push forward\
  \ international climate change negotiations. It was a key player in developing both\
  \ the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) and the Kyoto Protocol\
  \ and most recently the Paris Agreement on climate change. the story will help review\
  \ how nations are being compliant with such agreements, the importance of such agreements,\
  \ there effects and how Africa is doing in comparison with the rest of the world."
