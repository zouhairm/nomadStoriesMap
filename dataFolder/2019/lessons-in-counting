Text: "There may be people in this world for whom the days unfold like a carpet. For\
  \ whom life is sure to keep rolling out in front of them with every step they take.\
  \ There may be people in this world who never really touch life, who are able to\
  \ move linearly - sempre dritto - head up, shoulders back and forward, always forward.\
  \ There may be those people, but not here. \n\nMy apartment was on the first floor,\
  \ it was old but as charming as you\u2019d expect. On the second floor lived a young\
  \ family with their 18-month old son, Diego.\nIn the mornings, footsteps down the\
  \ stairwell were accompanied by a cautious tally; \u201Cuno\u2026due\u2026tre\u201D\
  \ each number met by the landing of his little feet on the speckled terrazzo floor.\
  \ It\u2019s easy to forget that we all had to learn that. We become so complacent\
  \ in our footing, easily irritated when things don\u2019t come fast to us. For a\
  \ month, I\u2019d been attending language school five days a week, four hours a\
  \ day, immersing myself in another tongue as wholly as I could. Still, progress\
  \ was slow. Diego and his morning strolls came to me as daily encouragement, an\
  \ undercover cheerleader. We had a lot in common, Diego and I, both feeling out\
  \ this new world. \u2018Go slow\u2019, he seemed to say, \u2018these things take\
  \ time\u2019. \n\nIt was February and fog loomed over the island like a spell, stretching\
  \ a low wool ceiling over the lagoon. From my window a small square lay empty to\
  \ the left. To the right, a calle snaked into darkness beyond the street lamps.\
  \ Often the city seemed like a trick. You\u2019ve seen a million images of it before,\
  \ is this another one or could it be the real thing? Its beauty is suspicious, it\u2019\
  s streets, too - maze like and conspiring. It takes patience learning how to navigate\
  \ them. My confidence in serene geography comes after a long week of being terribly\
  \ lost. When I found myself rushing home from school I\u2019d be reminded of Diego.\
  \ \u2018Go slow\u2019, I\u2019d tell myself, or \u2018pian pianin\u2019 as they\u2019\
  d say in Venetian dialect. I\u2019d look up at the stories played out in the facades\
  \ of churches. I\u2019d trace the stone walls with my fingers as I walked. I\u2019\
  d stop to notice the seaweed that clung to the bricola like eels, witches fingers\
  \ that curl with the tide. Climbing bridges and counting \u201Cuno\u2026due\u2026\
  tre\u2026\u201D with each step until I could cross them blindly.  \n\nWinter on\
  \ the island is a strange time. The crowds of holidaymakers cease and what is left\
  \ is a sparse population of people, beauty\u2019s crusaders. A people unwilling\
  \ to leave, in spite of the impracticalities life on their flooding island brings.\
  \ The extreme weather, unreliable public transport, mass tourism and lack of residential\
  \ housing make \u2018La bella Venezia\u2019 a difficult place to live. \nDespite\
  \ this, they stay. A slow resistance, these people do not rush. They know that beauty\
  \ only exists in slow motion, in process. They make time to chat before work, fish\
  \ for their dinner and walk the long way home just to see the bruising sky as it\
  \ sets pink and purple over the Grand Canal. Nothing is easy here, no, but for 5\
  \ minutes under an empty sotoportego, when the moon is reflected plump and glossy\
  \ in the water, I understand. They stay as a political act against a world that\
  \ spins always faster. \n\nOn my last evening in Venice I took a nap, and woke up\
  \ to find snow cloaking the campo. I couldn\u2019t believe it. There was Diego,\
  \ in a similar state of disbelief, patting a snowball between his red mittens like\
  \ it was something rare and precious. \u2018Is Santa coming back?\u2019 he enquired\
  \ sincerely to his parents. They laughed, shaking their heads. But I understood\
  \ his question, because to find yourself in this strange place requires belief in\
  \ something magical. A belief in the beauty of getting lost; a belief in process,\
  \ asking silly questions, being curious. Venetians have always known this. \nAs\
  \ they made their way inside, Diego\u2019s mother held his hand, steadying him in\
  \ the snow, \u2018pian pianin\u2019, she said, \u2018pian pianin\u2019."
