Text: "Bali, a small island that has always been a dream for everyone. The island\
  \ that has many attraction to every human being in the entire world to explore,\
  \ to live, and a place to find identity by its natural and wellness lifestyle.\n\
  My journey starts by exploring the underwater of Menjangan Island, an island that\
  \ surrounded by a lot of beautiful coral reefs and various kinds of marine life\
  \ that can make everyone feel amazed and relentless to look at. This place is magical.\
  \ Beautiful scenery of the mountain, a cool breeze from the ocean, a dance from\
  \ the coconut tree, making you feel that you live i the paradise. And of course\
  \ it Summer all the year.\nMy journey continues to a village that authentically\
  \ Bali, Munduk Village. A Villages that still keep cultural traditions for generations,\
  \ and very famous by its natural beauty of the mountains, waterfalls and plantations\
  \ such as coffee, chocolate and nutmeg. I can feel the fresh air blowing my skin,\
  \ a fresh air which still not contaminated by pollution, makes me really lovethis\
  \ place, a place that always inspires and give a lot of bright ideas. I can tell\
  \ that wake up up in the morning, sit for a moment in front the guest house's terrace\
  \ where i stay and enjoy a cup of black coffee that produce by local farm and processed\
  \ also by the local people, making your mind more refreshed and releasing all the\
  \ stresses of life in the city life.\n40 minutes from the Munduk village, a cultural\
  \ preserve namely Jatiluwih Village. The village which is famous for its farming\
  \ systems and beautiful rice terrace. It makes this place one of the patents inherited\
  \ by UNESCO. If we see from a distance, jatiluwih will look like a large park with\
  \ a background of Mount Karu. This rice terrace system has become a culture of local\
  \ people in Bali since long time ago to support their farming and water irrigation.\
  \ On the way to the south of Bali, i stop at Tegalalang, Ubud. A cultural village\
  \ located in the middle of the island of Bali. A place where people learn and experience\
  \ a way of cultural, healthy and basic lifestyle. \nMy journey ended in a sub-beach\
  \ with a beautiful cliff, called Uluwatu Beach. a place that has a rhythm that is\
  \ released by the sound of the waves, with views of Uluwatu Temple and amazing \
  \ sunset. A place that makes everyone fall in love at first sight."
