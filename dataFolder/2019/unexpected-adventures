Text: As I flew in to the Lisbon airport I didn't know what I was getting myself into
  but when I travel outside to go to my Airbnb I was whisked away into the world as
  Colour and beautiful architecture the streets were bustling at the time it was dinner
  hour and I felt a bit jet-lagged so I went to a local eatery to get a little bit
  of food and I was in for a treat I had lamb with a nice Pinot Grigio on the side
  and it was a beautiful meal something I never knew I could get in this wonderful
  of course you can get lamb anywhere but for some reason I must have stumbled into
  an amazing little restaurant as I finished my meal I walked around and looked at
  the building's the cobblestones or something different but very elegant beautiful
  as well as all the different colored buildings some old very old and some new when
  you go to Portugal you realize that the little Villages are so different from the
  United States and that the fact that it's so much older then the United States that
  I realized that there's so much more history involved I highly recommend this place
  to anyone who's looking to travel to an amazing place in Europe that they've never
  been to traveling is an amazing wait to see the world and when you can write about
  it and it's even better memories are something that has humans we can only comprehend
  so much and amazing experience.
