Text: "Finally, I was starting to doze off. It was just past midnight though it seemed\
  \ much later. How many hours did I already spend on this godforsaken bus, was it\
  \ 10, 15, 20? We picked seats on the second level, directly in the front so we had\
  \ an amazing view, an impeccable scene to get lost in a day dream. We were traveling\
  \ from Valpara\xEDso to San Pedro de Atacama by bus.\nThe poor infant who cried\
  \ bloody murder for what seemed like eternity, ultimately settled to rest. I was\
  \ coming down from a wine haze, because that is what you do on a bus when you have\
  \ hours to kill. You drink Malbec until your teeth turn a faint shade of red, you\
  \ laugh deep from your belly as you try to sing along to the four reggaeton songs\
  \ on repeat. You make the most out of it.\nAs we came to a stop, my travel companion\
  \ turned towards me, I could see his eyes widen in the dim light the bus offered\
  \ during sleeping hours. In my exhausted state, no longer wanting to think about\
  \ anything especially the logistics of travel, I merely listened to my travel buddy\
  \ to get off the bus.\nAs the driver handed us our bags, everyone else continued\
  \ to sleep soundly. I was jealous of them as I shivered in the desert\u2019s night\
  \ chill. The bus driver looked at us with eyes of uncertainty, but decided not to\
  \ share what he was thinking or perhaps he didn\u2019t know how to say it in English.\
  \  As soon as the bus drove into the darkness ahead we immediately knew, without\
  \ saying a word. Internal panic ensued.\nOf course, no one was at the bus station\
  \ it was after 1am in the middle of nowhere. But lucky us, there was a bar across\
  \ the dirt road which appeared to be open. As we approached, I could hear loud dance\
  \ music blaring from the place, and could see neon lights aglow from the few small\
  \ windows.\nAs I opened the door, everyone stopped talking and stared our way. We\
  \ clearly were out of place. At this point, it didn\u2019t matter to me. I found\
  \ a table to throw my densely full pack, I needed relief. What next?\nCerveza! It\
  \ seemed like a good idea. It was apparent the language barrier was going to keep\
  \ us there for the time being.\nAfter a few moments, the patrons started to garner\
  \ interest in us. Soon we were laughing and enjoying ourselves. Internal panic subdued.\
  \ Following some use of Spanglish on both sides, the group of Chileans understood\
  \ our predicament.  An older gentleman, in his early 50s, got up from the table\
  \ without saying a word.\nMy travel companion and I glanced at each other confused,\
  \ did we perhaps offend him in some way. When another patron offered up that the\
  \ gentleman had a car and was going to drive us the 50+ miles to San Pedro. Smiles\
  \ gleaned across both our faces. We said goodbye, threw our bags over our shoulders\
  \ and followed the gentleman towards the door.\nI\u2019ve since forgotten the gentleman\u2019\
  s name, but not his face. He was worn by hard work and the harsh weather of the\
  \ desert. His wrinkles were deep; his lips big, his skin a comforting light brown.\
  \ He didn\u2019t smile much, but he didn\u2019t look bothered either.  \nI put my\
  \ head back and for the first time noticed the night\u2019s sky. The mixed pale\
  \ colors of the galaxy lay above us, all those other worlds and their stars. The\
  \ driver saw us in awe; he pulled over and turned off the car. We obeyed his request\
  \ and got out. The three of us stood there still, with the wind blowing softly.\
  \ I didn\u2019t want to leave; I didn\u2019t want to be anywhere else. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find such wonder there on a lonely road in the middle of the night smack\
  \ dab in the heart of the Atacama Desert with a man I hardly knew who was no longer\
  \ a stranger."
