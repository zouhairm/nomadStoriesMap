Text: "- \u201COnly Muslim people can pass here\u201D! -Five armed policemen said\
  \ in a very firm but broken English. They looked particularly unfriendly and made\
  \ me feel uncomfortable straight away. Almost pointing at me with massive rifles\
  \ they somehow explained that the visiting hours of the Temple Mount which made\
  \ Jerusalem third holiest city in the world after Mecca and Medina are only from\
  \ 7 to 10 in the morning.\nThe road was closed and my dream to see the iconic Dome\
  \ of the Rock started to fade away. \nI turn back and soon reached a pleasant chaos\
  \ of colors, spices, souvenirs, traditional sweets and smells - the beauty of the\
  \ Muslim Quarter. I spend there a couple of hours before entering the Jewish Quarter.\n\
  There are no signs or separated walls, but everyone knows where one quarter ends\
  \ and another begins. It is impossible to make a mistake. The atmosphere suddenly\
  \ changed, the buzz of vendors was gone, and I saw many Jewish solders with loosely\
  \ strapped guns on their shoulders just walking around or having lemonade and a\
  \ sandwich in a cafe. Some were happily posing with tourist and having a great time.\
  \ They looked very smart but somehow innocent in perfectly fitted uniforms, especially\
  \ young girls with high waist trousers revealing slim figures. \nI passed the security\
  \ check point and reached the Western Wall \u2013 the place of prayer and pilgrimage\
  \ sacred to the Jewish people. I saw the line separating men and women, but it wasn\u2019\
  t in the middle. Males had a lot more than half of the space so they could freely\
  \ stand and pray but females were so squashed and not all of them were able to touch\
  \ the wall and had to pray just looking at it. \nWhen I entered the Christian Quarter,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t believe I was in the same city. For the first few minutes I didn\u2019\
  t see a soul. It was unusually quiet that you could hear a pen drop. For a moment\
  \ I thought I entered some forbidden land but soon enough spotted a father and son\
  \ entering the house, so my worries disappeared. Every door was marked with crosses\
  \ and portraits of the Saints. The air felt so peaceful and calm. \nArmenian Orthodox\
  \ Quarter is the smallest in size and population, and it is the only quarter not\
  \ dedicated to a world\u2019s major religion. Even though it was the end of January,\
  \ Christmas trees, lights and decorations were still in full glory. Almost every\
  \ house had an Armenian flag which showed ownership and pride. The corner houses\
  \ of the streets had the most beautiful ceramic tiles stopping everyone to admire.\n\
  The Church of the Holy Sepulchre is known to all religions which believe in Jesus.\
  \ Millions of people come to touch the tomb of Christ.  I have never been anywhere\
  \ where you can inhale a wave of hope, prayer, love, sadness and joy at the same\
  \ time.  I looked around and in the corner of my eye I saw something truly spectacular.\
  \ An Armenian woman came to consecrate a bundle of white handkerchiefs. She was\
  \ praying and touching every single one of little embroidered ones and carefully\
  \ folding them up in a little pile. She was kneeling and looked totally immerse\
  \ in her own world of worship. I didn\u2019t dare to photograph this moment. It\
  \ was too pure and too beautiful to invade. I just stood in a far end and let it\
  \ be.\nBefore I visited the old town of Jerusalem, I had no idea what I fill find.\
  \ I can honestly say I was blown away how different the place was! In one day, I\
  \ felt scared, happy, sad, astonished, intrigued and fascinated. If I had a wish,\
  \ I would want Jerusalem to stay in peace forever with no wars, conflicts or disturbances."
