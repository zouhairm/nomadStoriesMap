Text: "The day I visited Minas Gerais I found out that I had never really seen gold.\
  \ Seeing churches fulfilled with gold statues, walls, murals is quite an experience.\
  \ But what I found out being there is that the place goes beyond all the famous\
  \ colonial constructions. While we were almost climbing one very steep street of\
  \ Ouro Preto (a city which name translates to Black Gold) on our way to visiting\
  \ a church, our guide warned us that below all those old cobbled streets were lots\
  \ and lots of tunnels. He joked the \u201Cmineiros\u201D (a word that in Portuguese\
  \ means both the people who live in Minas Gerais and those who work in mines) liked\
  \ cheese so much they lived above one. We didn\u2019t understand it at first.\n\
  After a long and tiring walk, we got to the Nossa Senhora do Pilar church, which\
  \ is the second richest church in Brazil, ornate with 450 kilograms of gold. And\
  \ there we shared the space with literally hundreds of people. It was a really beautiful\
  \ building. But to be honest I don\u2019t remember the details about it. What I\
  \ do remember is the Gege Mine. There we found out what the tunnels our guide mentioned\
  \ were: the hundreds of mines that fed the gold frenzy a few centuries ago. If you\
  \ don\u2019t look for where the gold comes, you\u2019ll never know. Because, just\
  \ like those tunnels, the story of the miners that worked on them keeps hidden from\
  \ the visitors. \nSo, in a group of about twenty students, we entered Gege. If seeing\
  \ tons of gold was quite an experience, this was even stronger. The gold is everywhere,\
  \ but when you go deeper and enter in that narrow, dark, smelly mine with rarefied\
  \ air it strikes you: that's where all the richness comes from. And you can't help\
  \ but see in front of you all the enslaved people in unhealthy conditions that constructed\
  \ Minas Gerais. We heard a story inside the mine that people always kept birds inside\
  \ when working there, because they are the first to die when there\u2019s not enough\
  \ air to breathe, warning the workers they had to leave. And that was not one of\
  \ the worst mines to work. After that experience, not a single one of us felt good\
  \ in the churches we visited.\nWe continued our journey to the city of Mariana.\
  \ A city that completely changed in the last four years after a tailings dam broke\
  \ and spilled iron ores through the fields where hundreds of people lived. The city,\
  \ once filled with tourists, was empty, we were almost alone in that very tidy city,\
  \ with incredible churches. However, one of the most important people we could meet\
  \ was there. A man whose life went from riding horses in the field with his daughter,\
  \ eating what he planted and waking up to the sound of birds; to a deep depression\
  \ and feeling an outsider in his own home town. All that because his house was completely\
  \ wiped out because of the tailings. Not a fish in the Doce river survived, few\
  \ birds still sang. The company responsible for the dam is a mining company. \n\
  After returning, we got the news that a new dam broke. A dam owned by the same company,\
  \ now in the city of Brumadinho. Another river died, now it was the Paraopeba river.\n\
  In Portuguese, Minas Gerais means general mines. And till this date, its history\
  \ is stained with mining tailings. But I personally think their History is much\
  \ more related to birds. To all the birds that could not breathe, that was buried\
  \ in tailings. But mainly because birds are a symbol to hope. Getting to know the\
  \ \u201Cmineiros\u201D made me certain that the cities are not built over tunnels,\
  \ their foundation consists of resilience."
