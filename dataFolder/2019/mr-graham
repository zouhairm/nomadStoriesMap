Text: "\u201CMr Graham, I hate you. I hate you so very very much.\u201D\n\nThis is\
  \ the thought that\u2019s pushing me up this steep-as-hell path under the scorching\
  \ hot sun. I haven\u2019t seen anyone in the last two days, I\u2019m muttering death\
  \ threats under my breath and all I have to sustain myself is a bag of disgustingly\
  \ salty lentils that I forcedly shove into my mouth every few minutes. \n\nEmbarking\
  \ on a three-day hike of the Freycinet Peninsula didn\u2019t seem like such a challenging\
  \ task, at first. And it wouldn\u2019t have been, if it wasn\u2019t for a series\
  \ of very poor decisions on my behalf: starting with the trust I put in a bearded\
  \ guy at the visitor centre, who assured me there were \u201Ctons\u201D of rainwater\
  \ tanks along the way. \u201CProbably not full in this time of the year\u201D, he\
  \ said, \u201Cbut enough to get you going\u201D. Well, the tanks were definitely\
  \ there; the rainwater wasn\u2019t. What\u2019s more, trusting the bearded man was\
  \ only the first brilliant idea, the second one being my decision to pack a light\
  \ backpack, which resulted in both my water and my food supplies running low far\
  \ sooner than expected. On the morning of my third day, I had the most infamous\
  \ idea of them all: to cook my last food, a bag of lentils, in sea water. How salty\
  \ can it be?, I asked myself. \n\nSo now I\u2019m fighting my gag reflex and facing\
  \ my last trial, the fearsome Mt Graham, that in my epic struggle for survival has\
  \ become Mr Graham, my sworn enemy. \u201CYou think you can take me down?\u201D\
  , I diss him, \u201COh, you have no idea. You have no idea, Graham.\u201D Yet deep\
  \ inside me I\u2019m praying for a miracle, a spring from the rocks, a stream, a\
  \ sudden pour of rain. I\u2019d even settle for a puddle. But no one\u2019s listening.\
  \ The land stays dry and the sky clean: it\u2019s just me, me against the mighty\
  \ Graham. \u201CYou won\u2019t have me\u201D, I say, now almost crawling. Sunrays\
  \ are beating on my head and I\u2019m so dizzy the path starts wobbling; but I can\
  \ see the end. \u201CYou won\u2019t have me\u201D, I whisper.    \n\nAs the mirror-like\
  \ surface of Coles Bay opens wide before me, I finally shut up. The trance I had\
  \ entered is wiped out by the vision of blinding spreads of water in every direction\
  \ and islands rising up from the horizon like constellations. I\u2019m soaked in\
  \ sweat, light-headed. And victorious. I fall to my knees, trying to embrace the\
  \ peak with my arms, and in a surge of kindness I forgive Graham for all he\u2019\
  s done to me. That\u2019s when I hear voices. An answer? No, they\u2019re not in\
  \ my head, this time: they\u2019re real voices, real voices from real people. People!\
  \      \n\nI have thanked Mt Graham many times after that. Because the people those\
  \ voices belonged to ended up being far more than two or three (unbelievably pleasant)\
  \ gulps of fresh water. Seeing how excited and cheerful I was, the five hikers thought\
  \ I\u2019d be a perfect fit for their crew. They took me to their sailboat, we had\
  \ drinks, then the skipper, an old Australian sailor, popped the question. \u201C\
  Those islands\u201D, he said, \u201CDo you want to walk on them?\u201D I told him\
  \ I needed to think about it. Too many bad decisions had been made in the past few\
  \ days. \n\nBut there, in the loneliness and silence of my tent, the right choice\
  \ was clear. In the morning, I bid my farewell to Tasmania and hopped on the sailboat\
  \ Bomoh, setting off as a deckhand across what remains, to this day, one of the\
  \ saltiest seas I\u2019ve ever tasted."
