Text: "The crowd is frenetic, surging forward in a collective stomping of feet and\
  \ bobbing of heads and waving of hands. Swept up in the throng, I join in the singing:\
  \ \u201CYo yo yo yo-yo\u201D, my voice muted by the roar of sound around me. \"\
  We'll be in the pipoca,\u201D my friend Jorge told me earlier, as we jumped out\
  \ of the taxi and began the short walk to Largo do Campo Grande to join the start\
  \ of the parade. Pipoca means popcorn. Now I understand what he meant. It\u2019\
  s a pressure cooker here: a hot, carnal mix of skin-on-skin, ear-splitting acoustics\
  \ and wild, unabashed exuberance.\n\nIn Salvador, capital of Brazil\u2019s sun-drenched,\
  \ northeastern state of Bahia, locals laugh as they tell me: \u201CCariocas (residents\
  \ of Rio) don\u2019t know how to party!\u201D Sure, Carnival in Rio is undeniably\
  \ iconic and spectacular, but Salvador\u2019s Carnival offers a different experience\
  \ \u2013 something grittier, rowdier and arguably more authentic. Unlike Rio, where\
  \ the most popular way to take part in Carnival is to watch the samba school parades\
  \ in the Samb\xF3drome, or to buy a costume and join in the dance competitions,\
  \ in Salvador, it\u2019s all about the blocos - frenzied street parties consisting\
  \ of thousands of people following huge, slow-moving trucks fitted with enormous\
  \ sound systems and with their favourite bands playing on top. These trio eletricos\
  \ wend their way through the city streets along three main routes, each of which\
  \ takes between five to seven hours to complete. \n\nWe\u2019re following the trio\
  \ eletrico of local singer Saulo performing Ax\xE9, a high-energy music style blending\
  \ Afro-Caribbean rhythms with Brazilian street music and modern pop. The music epitomises\
  \ the vibe of this part of the world, with its myriad of cultural influences. Founded\
  \ by the Portuguese in 1549, Salvador was Brazil\u2019s first capital, and the destination\
  \ for an estimated 1.2 million slaves brought from Africa to work on the region\u2019\
  s sugar plantations. Today, this tropical city remains the heart of Afro-Brazilian\
  \ culture, and despite its sobering history, its people exude a laid-back, carefree\
  \ spirit. \n\nThe parade takes us past crumbling buildings in pastel hues of salmon\
  \ and turquoise, examples of the 17th and 18th century Portuguese colonial architecture\
  \ found throughout the city. Salvador\u2019s historic centre, Pelourinho, with its\
  \ Renaissance and Baroque-style buildings and elaborate gold churches, was considered\
  \ to hold such outstanding universal value that it was declared a world heritage\
  \ site by UNESCO in 1985. Yet it has a dark past: Pelourinho, meaning pillory, was\
  \ named after the wooden whipping post where slaves were once brutally punished\
  \ for transgressions. Nowadays, the colourful city centre charms tourists with its\
  \ cobblestone lanes, lively plazas, street stalls and souvenir shops. \n\nAs we\
  \ make our way along Avenida Sete de Setembro, locals hang out of terrace windows\
  \ above us, waving the Brazilian flag and cheering us on. The sky is an intense\
  \ blue, broken up by silhouettes of palm trees. Huge, burly Afro-Brazilian men,\
  \ bedecked in pearls and beads, and wearing the beautiful white Baiano dresses usually\
  \ reserved for women serving acaraj\xE9, a local Bahian street food, leap around\
  \ taunting and teasing us, laughing and blowing kisses from their red lipstick-stained\
  \ mouths. \n\nI marvel at the ceaseless energy of the Brazilians; renowned for their\
  \ ability to party, it\u2019s little wonder Carnival lasts almost a week, with many\
  \ locals taking part in the festivities every day. Music and dance is part of the\
  \ fabric of life here; everyone seems to have an innate rhythm, with the ability\
  \ to move seamlessly from one dance style to the next as the music changes.   \n\
  \nThe parade ends at Pra\xE7a Castro Alves, overlooking the magnificent Baia de\
  \ Todos os Santos - Bay of All Saints - the largest bay in Brazil. A sea of humanity\
  \ stretches out before us; beyond that, the huge expanse of ocean sparkles in the\
  \ afternoon light. After more dancing and revelry, the crowd begins to dissipate,\
  \ so we trudge back along the cobblestone streets in search of a local eatery. As\
  \ the sun dips low in the sky, we devour acaraj\xE9 and slurp down sugary Guarana,\
  \ Brazil's favourite soft drink, while trails of partygoers head home to recuperate;\
  \ no doubt they'll be back to do it all again tomorrow."
