Text: "Waking up at the foot of the Virunga Mountains\u2013a massive chain of volcanic\
  \ mountains that borders Rwanda, Uganda and the Democratic Republic of Congo\u2013\
  the first thing I saw was an impenetrable cloud cap covering the peak of Mount Karisimbi.\
  \ Up in the jungle of these beautiful mountains resides the greatest concentration\
  \ of mountain gorillas left in the world.  With the mysterious and verdant mountain\
  \ range looming up before me, I had a great sense of anticipation.\n\nWith the advent\
  \ of gorilla tourism, 8 gorilla families out of 17 in the Virunga Mountains are\
  \ habituated to humans. Tourists interested in seeing the gorillas may hike into\
  \ the mountains in small groups and can, for one hour, quietly observe a gorilla\
  \ family in its natural habitat. Gorilla tourism has been instrumental in decreasing\
  \ gorilla poaching as many of the poachers are now employed as trackers and porters\
  \ and are therefore invested in preserving their gorilla population. \n\nMy group\
  \ of six trekkers was assigned to the Ngambara gorilla family. Starting off at over\
  \ 8000ft above sea level, our lungs struggled with lower oxygen levels and the steep\
  \ climb quickly left us out of breath. After several hours of hiking, our group\
  \ veered off the main path into the thick jungle. Above us, Tarzanic vines hung\
  \ in ropy masses and tall trees rose up like quiet giants. The stinging nettles\
  \ grew so densely here that they were now almost impossible to avoid. \n\nAfter\
  \ some time of hiking through this denser jungle, our guide, Felicien, stopped us\
  \ at a large tree and told us to put down our backpacks. \u201CWe don\u2019t want\
  \ the gorillas to smell any food you have with you,\u201D he explained. He then\
  \ lead us further into the thicket. Suddenly, Felicien began making a series of\
  \ low grunts. Earlier, he had demonstrated a variety of sounds gorillas use to communicate.\
  \ We all stood tense, full of excitement mixed with a what was perhaps an evolutionary\
  \ sense of fear.\n\nMoments later, I got my first glimpse of a mountain gorilla.\
  \ He was a large silverback sitting quietly and cradling his head. He sat so close\
  \ to us, I could see the flutter of his eyelashes and smell his pungent gorilla\
  \ scent. I was mesmerized. Felicien told us that there were three silverbacks in\
  \ this family group and that this one was second in rank. Nearby, a smaller female\
  \ sat in a clump of grass. Apparently, while females are off-limits to the lower-ranked\
  \ silverbacks, they will sometimes sneak away from the family group and mate with\
  \ them. If the top silverback catches them, the duplicitous couple is punished.\n\
  \nNearby the dominant silverback lazed on his back with a mass of female and baby\
  \ gorillas around him. One particularly infant--a 3 month-old with sticking-up punky\
  \ hair--climbed all over his mother and demanded her attention while she tried to\
  \ nap. Slightly older gorilla babies playfully rolled around, pulling at each other\u2019\
  s hair and somersaulting over the bodies of the adult gorillas. \n\nI completely\
  \ lost all sense of time watching the gorilla family. I was struck by the humanness\
  \ of their interactions\u2013the gentle grooming, the playful tumblings and affectionate\
  \ intertwining of gorilla bodies. While I\u2019ve seen a lot of wildlife in my time\u2013\
  primarily as a child growing up in South Africa and later on trips to Asia and Africa\u2013\
  there was something particularly powerful and elemental about this experience. We\
  \ were in the gorilla family\u2019s intimate space with no glass window or car door\
  \ between us. In such close proximity, it was easy to grasp how much we have in\
  \ common. Specifically, we share 98.6% of our genetic code with gorillas and like\
  \ us, they prioritize family, have human-like hands, have an almost nine month gestation\
  \ period, communicate using sound, are susceptible to the same diseases and have\
  \ a very similar sense of smell, taste and sight. \n\nIn the final moments before\
  \ we had to leave, I watched as the mother of the smallest infant engulfed her son\
  \ in an embrace. She looked up at my camera and stared directly at me. Her expression\
  \ was so strikingly human in that moment and I saw in her eyes something universal\
  \ and profoundly expressive."
