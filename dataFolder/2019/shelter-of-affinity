Text: "Every journey invariably offers us a chance to learn, grow and reach out for\
  \ our dreams. The places never meet but people do! and if we've met people,  we\
  \ bring a part of that place within our heart as exquisite memories. The sweetest\
  \ memory i have is when i was traveling to Madurai : city of temples in Karnataka\
  \ state of India. \nIt was beautiful morning, seems like nature itself is playing\
  \ mesmerizing music and wind is its instrument. I woke up feeling a new freshness\
  \ and excited mind. I walked to door of train and opened it, with a sudden the cold\
  \ wind kissed my chicks with the otherworldly breez. I could feel the eldritch touch\
  \ of nature and getting my every single body part influenced by it. The train stopped\
  \ at next station and the peace was replaced by exclaims of tea-coffee sellers.\
  \ Meanwhile my attention was carried off by a savory, fetching and charming mid\
  \ age lady. She seemed like source of redolence of positive energy of nature. I\
  \ was stupefied with the rattling face with surreal smile. I could imagine that\
  \ this lovely morning has taken a shape of lady with innocent face, wrapped in a\
  \ beautiful saree with garland in her tied hairs. Her nose pin seemed like rising\
  \ golden sun and her charming smile spreading the glimmer. All of sudden she asked\
  \ in Kannada (language) that i could not understand. I was wondering when did she\
  \ come close to me. I replied \"Kannada barala\" (i don't know Kannada)  the little\
  \ i knew. She gestured and asked \"Madurai \"?\nAnd i said yes. I picked up her\
  \ luggage and hoisted at the place she wanted. Again she grumbled with smile in\
  \ a gesture of permission. I understood and nodded my head in approval. She settled\
  \ down on my seat and enshrouded herself with my blanket. All the time i was smiling\
  \ on her innocence. She tapped on seat and asked me to sit beside her while shaking\
  \ her head in tone of song she was singing. She was staring at me and when we had\
  \ an eye contact, she started telling me something. Although i did not understand\
  \ a single word. I was just listening to her likeable voice with beautiful gesture\
  \ and raising eyebrows and blinking eye with perfect line of kajal. I was totally\
  \ astound. After half and hour of her talks, she touched my knee and asked something\
  \ with wet eyes in which tear drop was struggling to come out and her expression\
  \ with expectance. I nodded my head for approval. She immediately washed her hand\
  \ and  took out and opened the box filled with 'Kesaribath'(a sweet dish). I was\
  \ still astound. She took a morsel with a hand while holding the box in another.\
  \ The kesaribath was hot, she tried to cool it down with puff and brought it close\
  \ to my mouth. I couldn't resist myself as i was under the love and overwhelming\
  \ smiling motherhood  wanting to feed me. I tasted that piece of heaven with her\
  \ fingers touching my lips and some of my front teeth. I felt that she is my mother\
  \ and i am her 5 year old son. She finished the box all by feeding me. I was sitting\
  \ struck with cordiality. Rest of the journey, about 1 hour she kept telling me\
  \ so many things and i didn't got to know when Madurai station has come. I wish\
  \ this journey to go on forever. We get off from train,  i touched her feet (indian\
  \ traditional to show respect). She has the same charming smile with tears in her\
  \ eyes. She kissed my forehead and gave blessings with both palm on my head and\
  \ left. I was standing still. Then a person who was sitting in front of my seat\
  \ came to me and said \"did you understand what was she told? \"\n\"No\"\n\"she\
  \ told you about her son. You look like him. She saw her son in you. Feeding you\
  \ gave her feeling that she is feeding her son, who is in army. \"\nMy heart melted\
  \ and explosion could be seen in eyes. I ran here and there to find her but couldn't\
  \ find her."
