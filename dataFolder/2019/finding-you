Text: "\"Como puedo tener la otra mitad de tu corazon? (How can I have the other half\
  \ of your heart?),\" my friend asks a petite blonde waitress inside a crowded bar,\
  \ an isthmus among a sea of bars, connecting locals and and tourists alike on a\
  \ cool Friday night in La Condesa, the stylish, tree-lined neighborhood in Mexico\
  \ City. His words tumble out unevenly, his pronunciation and words slightly off,\
  \ a sign to the waitress that while his interest and desire are genuine, the words\
  \ are not. The gold half-heart necklace she wears around her neck shields her from\
  \ any further mangled sentences (of which thankfully there are no more coming).\
  \ As his words boomerang back to him, the moment is too much for our other friend,\
  \ who uncontrollably spits out his drink in laughter. We all laugh, including the\
  \ waitress, and a memory is etched, one almost certainly forgettable for her but\
  \ indelible to us. My friend, the romantic, closes the scene with a declaration:\
  \ \"I'm going to learn Spanish before I head to a Spanish-speaking country again!\
  \ Just watch.\" \n\nMexico City -- there is something different and unique about\
  \ this sprawling metropolis, this capital city that's more than 7,000 feet above\
  \ sea level. No defined cliches about about needing to go \"beneath the surface\
  \ to find the 'real' city and citizenry that provide the beating heart of the city.\"\
  \ Or how the city \"exudes a history that you can reach out and  almost touch.\"\
  \ Or being a city that \"when it grabs you, it never lets go.\" While you might\
  \ be able to close your eyes and match another city or three to one of those phrases,\
  \ any and every cliche and application of it to this place would dull what is Mexico\
  \ City. Maybe it is a city dueling between what it was, what it is, and what it\
  \ could and hopes to be. And one could point to decrease in pollution from previous\
  \ decades, the rise in tourism, or even the name itself [from DF to CDMX]. Ultimately,\
  \ though, Mexico City just is.\n\nOccasional trucks slowly driving down wide boulevards\
  \ in the southern part of the city, with men yelling from megaphones, \"Microondas,\
  \ lavadoras, secadoras! Microondas, lavadoras, secadoras!\"\n\nTeenagers freestyle\
  \ rapping in the evenings on the steps of the Angel of Independence \n\nOlder people\
  \ dancing on a sun-draped Sunday afternoon in Allende Park, located in the famed\
  \ Coyoacan neighborhood in the southern half of the city\n\nThousands of kids, adults\
  \ young and old, and tourists and locals biking, skating, and rollerblading down\
  \ Avenida Paseo de la Reforma (this street and others are closed to cars every Sunday\
  \ from 8am - 2pm) as hundreds of people, led by zumba instructors, dance the morning\
  \ away\n\nVendors at a Cruz Azul La Liga Mx game selling ramen noodles (yes, the\
  \ same Styrofoam cups from your childhood) and snacks you would never find at your\
  \ local NBA or NFL game\n\nI didn't expect to find so much in Mexico City. But I\
  \ did. And the beauty of all of it is that in finding so much, I found the singular\
  \ thing that mattered the most: myself again. \n\nMaybe my friend will return to\
  \ Mexico City one day, perhaps to find the waitress he fell in love with. Perhaps\
  \ to confirm his fluency in Spanish. Or perhaps he will return to find himself again,\
  \ and discover how he can make what he felt for four days in Mexico City permanent\
  \ back in Chicago where we live now. And maybe I'll do the same."
