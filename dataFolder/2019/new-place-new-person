Text: "I was looking for a place, which could impact socially, I found AIESEC a company\
  \ in charge of making social exchanges, which showed me Mexico to work with children,\
  \ being there my life changed, I could appreciate other faces, accents, ways of\
  \ seeing the world, all embodied in people, those people who day by day moved through\
  \ Mexico City, colossal structures, new architecture, every moment in my stay was\
  \ captured with my camera.\n\nWorking with older adults was very pleasant, his way\
  \ of transmitting his life and his way through the world fascinated me, every moment\
  \ I was with them was an opportunity to personally feed me, because I am a pessimistic\
  \ person who always looks for buts with the purpose of understanding the world,\
  \ but have your words and phrases capture them with my camera made today can repocicionarme,\
  \ because the photo makes me remember every moment with them and their words\n\n\
  being in a city just photographing the city day and night while also approaching\
  \ me from the danger that involved doing this, it just made me feel more excited,\
  \ throw me to the floor, spin around, leave the tripod just to be able to get myself\
  \ out in a photo, It was fantastic, the people around did not understand what was\
  \ happening, they did not know that I was just taking a picture, a photo that was\
  \ all that was good, because this trip was the first one that I was alone and I\
  \ could not waste it, I had to record every moment\n\n\nIn the end, in their amazing\
  \ Mexican accent, they asked me if I was from around here, to which I answered no,\
  \ they were very happy and they told me that it was very interesting what I was\
  \ doing, not everyone was on the floor to take pictures for that zone, I'm talking\
  \ about the less common areas of the city, because in the angel of independence\
  \ everyone takes photos.\n can not express in words when I took a picture and edited\
  \ it, I was uploaded to social networks and my intention was to show the world from\
  \ my perspective where I was and what I was doing, really exposing the photographs\
  \ full of motivation to the people and that was what I received once I returned\
  \ to the country, words of comfort and motivation to travel, because what they saw\
  \ reflected in my photos some today made them travel around the world, some more\
  \ went to Mexico just to see in person the photos I could capture, for my part I\
  \ became a traveler, I do not have the resources necessary to travel, but it will\
  \ not be a problem because with every safe savings I will travel again, all my income\
  \ is currently to pay for a trip, motorcycles, cars and house do not interest me\
  \ , I'm only interested in being able to travel, it's something I have to take advantage\
  \ of because I still live with my parents."
