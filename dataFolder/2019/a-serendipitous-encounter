Text: "I never imagined it would be so difficult.  You see, I had planned with anticipation\
  \ for many months my first solo trip abroad, choosing Buenos Aires, Argentina. Recently\
  \ divorced and with kids in college, I was finally free, to rediscover the spontaneity\
  \ of my youth, reengage my passion for travel, and celebrate middle age with new\
  \ experiences.  Frankly, I wanted to get out of my comfort zone, to prove to myself\
  \ that I wasn\u2019t too old to have new adventures. I just knew that I would enjoy\
  \ this beautiful, romantic city, one with dramatic music, a rich and vibrant culture\
  \ and history.  I would sample Argentine asado at an authentic estancia and ride\
  \ horses with handsome gauchos.  I would learn the mystery of the Argentine tango\
  \ and dance the night away with a suave and debonair hombre.  I would take in all\
  \ of the famous sights, such as Caf\xE9 Tortoni, Teatro Colon, Plaza Mayo, Palacio\
  \ San Martin and La Recolata, the final resting place of many wealthy and prominent\
  \ individuals, including Eva Peron.  Bags packed and pesos in hand, I stepped off\
  \ the plane and to begin my adventure.  \n\nI found Buenos Aires to be an interesting\
  \ city and it checked every box on my must have list. As much as I enjoyed my daily\
  \ explorations, I was surprised to find myself feeling so lonely as the week progressed.\
  \  I stayed in an apartment in a residential area, and encountered few people. I\
  \ didn\u2019t know anyone in the country and my attempts at intermediate Spanish\
  \ were met with strange looks or laughs.  The tours I took were in Spanish and filled\
  \ with many tourists from other countries, where I found that English was not spoken\
  \ nor attempted as much as I would have expected. I craved to understand the dialogue\
  \ of the Spanish telenovelas and learn the reasons why workers were blocking the\
  \ freeways and picketing all over town on the nightly news.  Honestly, I really\
  \ just craved to connect with anyone.\n\nIn doing my research, everyone said not\
  \ to visit La Boca, a barrio in the south eastern part of Buenos Aires and home\
  \ of La Bombonera, the stadium of the beloved Boca Juniors soccer team.  It was\
  \ too dangerous for a single person, especially a woman, to visit, they said.  But\
  \ the vibrantly colored scrap metal shacks called my name from the seat of the hop\
  \ on hop off bus.  With combined excitement/apprehension, I disembarked the bus.\n\
  \nI followed the music to El Caminito (little walkway), cobblestone streets well\
  \ known in the neighborhood.  I explored quaint shops filled with soccer and tango\
  \ souvenirs, spirited music and enjoyed tango demonstrations.  Compared to most\
  \ of the week, which had been gloomy and cloudy, I found bright blue skies and weather\
  \ unusually warm on this beautiful spring day.  \n\nWhile walking down the street,\
  \ I approached La Rueda, a brightly colored restaurant adorned with authentic art\
  \ and outdoor seating.  I was greeted by Niles, a British expat, mid thirty, blond\
  \ and slim.  He had the formidable job of bringing customers to La Rueda.  Niles\
  \ would earn a commission for every guest that dined at the restaurant of his friend,\
  \ the owner. \n\nNiles had just moved back to Buenos Aires from Britain; he had\
  \ been feeling desperate as he been working diligently but had not \u2018made a\
  \ sale\u2019 in his first week at the job. And, then I appeared.  Initially, I was\
  \ very skeptical of his \u2018sales pitch\u2019, but as we continued our friendly\
  \ banter, I found him well traveled and authentic. Niles made his first pesos when\
  \ I agreed to have lunch at La Rueda and I finally had an interesting connection.\
  \  \n\nNiles insisted later that we have a photo taken together to celebrate our\
  \ serendipity and the joy of unexpected encounters. \n\nLater, I sat at my table\
  \ and listened to the poignant sound of a lone violin.  I enjoyed a delicious lunch\
  \ of carne, papas fritas and a glass of wine on a beautiful spring day, and I couldn\u2019\
  t have ever imagined a more perfect ending to my Buenos Aires adventure."
