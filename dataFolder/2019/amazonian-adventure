Text: "Travelling on a boat through the Amazonian rain forest is a memory of my life\
  \ that would be hard to ever forget. During my exchange-year in Brazil, I had the\
  \ chance to spend ten days in the untouched nature of Rio Preto, one of the two\
  \ main rivers uniting into the Amazonas \u2013 the world\u2019s largest river by\
  \ volume. With about fifty other exchange students we travelled on three boats into\
  \ the heart of the jungle, sleeping in hammocks and eating local specialities of\
  \ this South American paradise. We spent our days hiking in the rain forest, visiting\
  \ some of the oldest trees of the world, swimming in the river, getting to know\
  \ indigenous legends, observing animals and rare plants such as the Victoria Amazonia.\
  \ It is the world\u2019s largest water lily, its leaves being so huge that a small\
  \ child can easily stand on it. Anacondas, iguanas, alligators, apes and sloths\
  \ were only a few of the wonderful creatures we met. \n\nThe most breath-taking\
  \ experience was visiting a waterfall with special importance to the indigenous\
  \ people of Amazonia. It was deep in the forest, where enormous rocks formed a half-circle\
  \ with trees on their top. The crowns of a few trees were grown over the rift, seeming\
  \ to hang in the air, ready to fall at any moment. But they stood steadily, the\
  \ only movement was that of the waterfall, the cascade falling down from between\
  \ the roots of a huge tree, in one single jet. The sun shone through the crystal-clear\
  \ water which made a tremendous sound landing on a huge rock, surrounded by a little\
  \ lake. Behind the waterfall, there was a cave; black and deep, where light simply\
  \ disappeared. It is not surprising that the indigenous people regarded it to be\
  \ a sacral place, where they came to \u2018wash\u2019 their soul to get rid of any\
  \ evil and become clear again. We all took our turn in the ritual of stepping under\
  \ the column of water, going through a certain form of purification. With my legs\
  \ shaking under the incredible force of the waterfall, I could barely stand on my\
  \ feet: It was our initiation to the jungle-adventure, a lifelong memory. Returning\
  \ to the boats, the sun slowly disappeared behind the trees and the sounds of diurnal\
  \ animals were taken gradually by the creatures of the night. The second movement\
  \ of the rain forest\u2019s concert has started.\n\nAfter arriving to the boats\
  \ and having delicious dinner, we put up our hammocks getting ready to sleep. The\
  \ boats anchored and as the engine stopped you could feel the last wave of vibration\
  \ running through the body of the boat. For a second, there was complete silence.\
  \ Then, once again, the symphony of the night has started; the sweet noises of the\
  \ nocturnal animals filled up our ears with the beautiful music of nature. The sound\
  \ of gibbering apes, singing birds and chirping crickets all melted into a peaceful\
  \ melody.  Being far from any city, the sky above us full of stars looked like if\
  \ we were under a sieve, light coming in through its holes. The heat and the humidity\
  \ took away all our energy, but we were all awake yet, being aware of what a special\
  \ experience we were having. We simply didn\u2019t want to let it go. You could\
  \ feel the excitement of these young people realizing the uniqueness of the moment,\
  \ a memory that they were going to guard as some sort of secret treasure through\
  \ their whole life. But slowly, the exhaustion overcame our excitement and we all\
  \ fell asleep under the stars of Amazonia."
