Text: "A cultural experience through local food in California\u2019s desert.\n\n\n\
  \nMy eyes follow along the windy road as far as they can see; they locate where\
  \ the pavement holds the sky. The breeze softly blows through my hair as if it is\
  \ sweeping another decade behind me each mile traveled. Decades soon become centuries\
  \ and my mind can\u2019t help but wonder about those who traveled this land before\
  \ me, those who knew the land like the back of their hands and connected to it with\
  \ the soles of their feet. I think back to a time when its inhabitants relied on\
  \ starlight and these beautiful red-tinted landmarks to my left to guide them to\
  \ their destinations, instead of these road signs to my right. But today, it\u2019\
  s only the mountains in the distance and I, just before the sun begins winding down\
  \ for rest.\n \nI make my way past the delta, miles of crops and soft grassy plains,\
  \ and finally arrive at the Blue Sky Center, a camping oasis tucked within the beautiful\
  \ desert of Cuyama Valley, California. As I step out of the car onto the dirt road,\
  \ the serenity of silence wraps around me like a warm blanket and I am convinced\
  \ that the years did in fact roll back on the way. I see prairie wagon-styled camping\
  \ huts, wooden picnic tables, hammocks, and a full seven-course dinner, with ingredients\
  \ from local farmers, being cooked over a fire\u2014all surrounded by nothing but\
  \ the wide-open landscape. \n \nThe host, Alana, welcomes me and offers me a cocktail:\
  \ a sweet red concoction of fresh juices swirled with a cinnamon stick. It\u2019\
  s just as refreshing as the country air. I engage in conversation with other guests,\
  \ and we accompany each other to a table displayed with appetizers such as salt\
  \ cured lamb tartare and oysters. I pick up a charcoal roasted oyster topped with\
  \ a creamy red sauce made from overripe Hachiya persimmons, splashed with barrel\
  \ aged sherry vinegar, and paired with dried sage and rosemary. My taste buds are\
  \ ravished in delight and I pick up another.\n \nThe sun soon sets and the sky blushes\
  \ gorgeous shades of pinks, deep oranges and violets. The campsite glows in the\
  \ light of candles, lanterns, and the campfire. I proceed towards the picnic table\
  \ dressed in rustic elegance and take my seat on a handmade Native American-patterned\
  \ cushion. The flowers and candlelight set a very warm and welcoming tone. A sweet\
  \ and tangy Pinot Ver is served and shortly followed by a steaming plate of smoked-on-the-stock\
  \ Brussels sprouts paired with a rich goose mayonnaise is served. The zesty mayonnaise\
  \ complements the slightly charred sprouts very well. They quickly disappear, scoop\
  \ by scoop, until only singed flakes remain.\n\nThe next course is placed before\
  \ me: a fall sachet of parsnips, sweet potatoes and sliced lamb sausage. The light\
  \ game in the lamb highlights the caramelized sweet potatoes and is one of my favorite\
  \ dishes. After we finish, it is time for the first main dish; fire roasted Kanaloa\
  \ swordfish is served on a bed of delicata squash with a ver jus butter sauce. Beef\
  \ shin braised in bourbon with cornbread creme beans follows. Each dish is so exquisite\
  \ that I can\u2019t decipher whether the one I\u2019m eating tastes better or the\
  \ one that came before!\n \nToasty autumn desserts are ushered to the table; first,\
  \ delicious cinnamon roasted Cuyama apples and oats, and then a plate of cheddar\
  \ cheese filled dates and fresh honeycomb. Afterwards, we are warmed by coffee and\
  \ embers while enjoying the song of crickets.\n\nAs we sip our coffee, I think about\
  \ all the guests that traveled here tonight, from high and low, far and wide, to\
  \ find our seats here at this very table. Us, complete strangers came together and\
  \ enjoyed a feast filled with so much laughter and warmth, and for that I am thankful.\n\
  \ \nThe campfire crackles behind me and I watch the stars. Together, they hold the\
  \ moon perfectly in place. I smile, knowing it will guide me home tonight."
