Text: "I  emerged myself in one of my lovely interrail trips three years ago in Ireland.\
  \ I had already aquainted myself with the main highlights of the country seeing\
  \ as I have always wanted to visit it...\nMy feet always try to dance to their music\
  \ which makes me think that in another life I may have been Irish.\nThe idea is\
  \ that once I arrived in this gothic architectural, Guiness driven world by night,\
  \ with red cheeks, cheerful people savoring their days in lively pubs with my favorite\
  \ music, I knew I wanted to experience more of their culture. Even though Dublin\
  \ is a multicultural city because of the wide variety of travelers or immigrants,\
  \ you can easily spot Irish locals with their red hair, the well-known accent and\
  \ the friendly energy.\nThe Irish language still remains a mistery to me as to how\
  \ to pronounce any words written on their signs but luckily they were all translated\
  \ in English.\nAfter two days of wandering the streets of Dublin, I went on to visit\
  \ Cork with its museums and then Cobh, or the old Queenstown, the last port of call\
  \ for Titanic, a small town dominated by a lovely cathedral surrounded by houses\
  \ set in perfect order colored in rainbow. In the seaport you can see the White\
  \ Star Line sign, the former ticket office for boarding the Titanic.\nIn pursue\
  \ for more of the specific green fields, I wanted to see the entire Ring of Kerry,\
  \ but my vacation wasn\u2019t long enough to do so, hence I took a train to Kilarney,\
  \ the closest point from the ring.\nThis is a very small, charming city with lots\
  \ of souvenir shops, but it\u2019s beauty comes from the very near natural park.\
  \ I took a quick stroll through it just so to make it in time for the last train\
  \ to Kilkenny. The scenery was amazing even in the bit rainy weather at times, with\
  \ a herd of deer in the background on one side, and thrills of birds and I swear\
  \ i think I saw a Leprechaun  because he came out of nowhere and disappeared just\
  \ the same. At the end of one of the many routes there was Ross castle, a lovely\
  \ 15th century tower house.\nThe trainride to Kilkenny  was quite lovely as well,\
  \ as the trip was taking place in May, besides my favorite shade of green, there\
  \ were fields of flowers. In Kilkenny, besides roaming the castle and the gardens,\
  \ you can find a beautiful private house covered in green, which at that point was\
  \ under a rainbow since it had been raining, which made it all the more special.\n\
  The next day, I was embarking in a new part of the interrail, in Northern Ireland,\
  \ starting with Belfast. The people were a bit more serious and sophisticated, as\
  \ was the city, which had more futuristic buildings and a modern seaport, nevertheless\
  \ it gave me a bit the impression of Scandinavian life (higher percent viking influences\
  \ maybe?) but it was certainly impressive.\nFrom Belfast, I went on to Coleraine,\
  \ another small town, connecting train lines, but with its own charm, only to arrive\
  \ tommy favorite destination so far, the Giant\u2019s Causeway.\nThis is a coastline\
  \ sightseeing where you can witness the ocean\u2019s waves breaking onto volcanic\
  \ prefectly shaped hexagonal columns, for which you have to pay a small entrance\
  \ fee. However for me , Giant\u2019s Causeway meant much more, because from there\
  \ I went to Carrick-a-Rede, a high rope 20 m long and 30 m above rocks slim bridge.\
  \ But the trip towards it was simply  amazing, on the edge of the cliffs, with the\
  \ high strong wind in your hair, on a yellow flower paved track, even some cute\
  \ little wild rabbits encounter on the way. I would return there anytime.\nAfter\
  \ this, the train took me to Londonderry, another lovely, but short experience inside\
  \ the city walls.\nI most certainly will return at least for visiting Galway and\
  \ Cliffs of Moher, the rest of Ring of Kerry and Wicklow Mountains National Park.\
  \ I just didn\u2019t expect to be engulfed in such a diversity of pleasant feelings\
  \ in this forever green land."
