Text: "Salt water rained down on me, soaking through my leopard-print towel. Relentless,\
  \ frigid wind numbed my fingertips. I felt like a miserable, chilled sardine. And\
  \ sardines are the worst, absolutely nothing appealing about them. I wasn\u2019\
  t sure if my quivering was from temperature or the sea sickness that was slowly\
  \ consuming me. It\u2019s laughable really, considering where I was. \n\nThe Galapagos\
  \ Islands are not only a UNESCO World Heritage Site, but Ecuador\u2019s prized jewel.\
  \ I easily convinced two of my best friends to visit me before my two-year contract\
  \ was up. I was not about to leave without experiencing the land of blue-footed\
  \ boobies and giant tortoises. But above all, I desperately wanted to swim with\
  \ sea lions in their natural habitat.\n\nThe screeching of aircraft brakes had never\
  \ sounded so melodious as when we finally touched down on the island of Santa Cruz.\
  \ We pranced across the tarmac towards the world\u2019s first ecological airport,\
  \ lungs filled with sea breeze and the citrusy, resinous scent of palo santo wood.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThe Galapagos are an incredibly bio-diverse archipelago, home to the\
  \ largest abundance of species not found anywhere else on Earth,\u201D Xavier, our\
  \ guide and chef, explained. His vast knowledge and deep reverence for the islands\
  \ at the ripe age of nineteen was as impressive as the divine ceviche he meticulously\
  \ crafted. \n\nOur small snorkel group had just climbed back aboard the Isabella\
  \ after exploring yet another snorkel location, equally vacant of sea lions as the\
  \ previous two. While heading back to port, nausea set in soon after my disappointment.\
  \ The waves grew larger but our petite vessel kept a fast pace, resulting in a horrendously\
  \ turbulent boat ride. While everyone else took cover from sea spray under the enclosure,\
  \ I sprawled out on the stern of the boat, trying to deep-breathe and white-knuckle\
  \ my way back to shore. Just when I thought I had successfully fought back the urge\
  \ to vomit, my friend Stefanie flung her body on top of mine. \n\n\u201CI\u2019\
  m going to be sick!\u201D she shouted over the engine.\n\nWe held each other like\
  \ Jack and Rose floating on an over-sized fiberglass door, freezing, clinging to\
  \ hope. She took out a plastic bag and emptied the contents of her stomach into\
  \ it. The sound of retching and the smell of bile put me over the edge and I instinctively\
  \ grabbed the bag out of her hands. I\u2019m sure you can guess what happened next,\
  \ and it wasn\u2019t exactly my finest moment. I immediately burst into laughter.\n\
  \n\u201CAre you laughing right now?\u201D she asked incredulously. \n\n\u201CWe\
  \ just shared a barf-bag\u201D I said, laughing even more.\n\nShe shot me a look\
  \ of disgust before she began to laugh too. I knew then, there was no other person\
  \ I wanted to share the misery of that moment with. \n\nSuddenly, the engines cut\
  \ out and everyone swarmed the right side of the boat.  \n\n\u201COver there, on\
  \ the rocks \u2013 a whole colony of sea lions!\u201D Xavier exclaimed as people\
  \ nearly trampled us to get to their snorkel gear. I quickly tied off the bag of\
  \ our twice-baked ceviche and fought through my queasiness to do the same.\n\nOnce\
  \ in the water, something magical happened. The sea lions, aware of our arrival,\
  \ dove from the rocks in succession like synchronized swimmers, as if they had been\
  \ expecting us all day. I shoved my face under the water to marvel at them. They\
  \ were curious and some even brave enough to get close. One of the sea lions would\
  \ swim up to my mask, then jet away flirtatiously. We continued to dance this strange\
  \ but thrilling oceanic salsa, moving close and then apart, pivoting and twirling\
  \ to a rhythm seemingly familiar to both of us.\n\nI don\u2019t know how much time\
  \ had passed, but at some point, I realized that I was the only person left in the\
  \ water. When I finally surfaced, I could hear Xavier calling me back to the boat.\
  \ I began swimming towards the Isabella, a small pearl in the distance, nestled\
  \ between the blue equatorial sky and the emerald green Pacific. I glanced back\
  \ at the rocks and caught the eye of a lone sea lion, munching on a chilled sardine."
