Text: "Lebanon, not a common destination, far from the mainstream. Passionate about\
  \ Levant countries' rich culture and history, teenager, I used to dream about Baalbeck,\
  \ Tyr, Byblos, symbolizing glory and magnificence. It was time for me to experience\
  \ it for real and not daydreaming anymore, time to walk on one the greatest civilization's\
  \ footsteps: the Phenicians, who left behind them an unparalleled heritage which\
  \ Lebanese are still proud of as they still tend to call themselves the Phenicians.\
  \  \n\nAmongst the oldest cities still inhabited in the world, Lebanon has four\
  \ of them: Beirut, Tyre, Saida, and Byblos. \n\nThe Cedars country bordered by the\
  \ Mediterranean sea was in the '60s considered as THE place to be, labeled as \xAB\
  \ The Switzerland of the Middle East \xBB it was a very attractive touristic destination.\
  \ Mentioned and glorified in the Bible for its natural patrimony composed by mountains,\
  \ valleys, its land offers ingredients which contribute to make worldwide renowned\
  \ gastronomy. A legendary music scene, their iconic singers such as Fairouz and\
  \ Sabah pride of Lebanon are both watching us in Hamra and Gemmayze under the form\
  \ of street art.   \n\nAugust 2017, I landed in Beirut.\n\nMy first impressions:\
  \ density, noise but vibrant and intoxicating.   \n\nLebanon isn't schizophrenic\
  \ but carries a lot, its past and present, conservatism and modernity, multi confessionalism,\
  \ cosmopolitism, all of this nestled in a delicate geographical position that gives\
  \ a scary face but far from being fearful I decided to embrace this land. I saw\
  \ two faces of Beirut, the disfigured one with its stigmas from a long-lasting 25\
  \ years war (bullet traces on some building) and the reborn one through the Downtown's\
  \ brand new streets and buildings. Two sounds as background noise, the Muezzin's\
  \ prayer call from Al Amin mosque following by the bells of the Maronite Saint Georges\
  \ church.\n\nI could feel that somehow they do hold a grudge regarding what they\
  \ call \xAB a war which was not ours \xBB. Despite the war aftereffect there is\
  \ undeniably a thirst to celebrate life, the colourfull Mar Mikha\xEBl proves it,\
  \ during the week-end festivity takes all its sense among the numerous bars on Armenia\
  \ Street.  \nMonot Street in Ashrafieh, Saturday night, The Whole in the Wall bar\
  \ host live performers, that night Nour Nimri hit the stage on Coldplay's and Pearl\
  \ Jam's songs singing along with a young and fashionable crowd. I carried on in\
  \ Hamra, bars are packed, more likely with a mid 30's crowd but whatever the age\
  \ range Beirut will not sleep tonight. \n\nLebanon awakened all my senses, starting\
  \ with my taste buds, pampered during my entire stay. Beyond the traditional hummus\
  \ and tabouleh, I discovered exquisite dishes from Fishnak Kebab (meatball and sour\
  \ cherries) to Kebbeh Sajiye (beef onions and hot spices). As a breakfast, Abraham\
  \ my Airbnb host brought me a Kunefe, a phyllo dough with cheese soaked in syrup,\
  \ hearty and delightful. \n\nMy sense of smell was stimulated by the zaatar spice\
  \ along with the jasmine in the village of Deir Al Qamar, and Beiteddine palace,\
  \ Chouf District, my dearest places in Lebanon. \n\nTyra, Byblos I didn't miss any\
  \ of them. Baalbeck, finally I was there standing in front of the very well conserved\
  \ Bachus and Jupiter temple, mesmerizing. \n\nMy immersion with the indigenes was\
  \ unforgettable, through a glimpse of conversation shared in taxi service, a lunch\
  \ generously offered by Georges in Deir Al Qamar, from his rooftop terrace facing\
  \ a gorgeous view on the valley. Raed, a young man who took me for a ride to Beiteddine\
  \ and shared with me his extraordinary secret place overlooking the Chouf. Abraham,\
  \ a wise erudite man who taught me so much about Lebanon. Generous, benevolent,\
  \ cultured and outgoing are the Lebanese.  \n\nOn my last night, I walked down the\
  \ streets, back to Ashrafieh, in this darkness Virgin Mary and other religious icons\
  \ were all enlightened, this mystifying atmosphere put me in a halo of protection\
  \ and well being, a communion between me and this country.\n\nThe Lebanese poet\
  \ Khalil Gibran said \xAB  If Lebanon was not my country, I would have chosen it\
  \ to be. \xBB Lebanon, I made it mine for ten days and it was not a farewell."
