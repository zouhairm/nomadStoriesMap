Text: "Truth be told, I didn't know what to expect when sneaking into the abandoned\
  \ Nazi Airport, Rangsdorf on Halloween. But I got much more than I had bargained\
  \ for that day on the outskirts of Berlin. Venturing with three of my friends, one\
  \ of us was an urban photographer, the other an urban artist. \n\nWe had recently\
  \ read a blog on how to get into the Airfield and decided to catch an Uber there\
  \ for an obscure tourist experience. Once we had reached our destination we would\
  \ stealth through overgrown tracks and do not enter signs to make our way in. Approaching\
  \ buildings in the facility, we found ourselves in the administration block, scattered\
  \ with old files from the war and a few pieces of furniture. It was gut-wrenchingly\
  \ eerie, to say the least. I was the advocate behind this brave with the confidence\
  \ of past endeavours, but this time I was wrong to put my friends in this situation.\
  \ \n\nWhilst exploring the deteriorating staircases and forgotten rooms peeling\
  \ grey, we heard something. A slight movement outside, panic was in the air and\
  \ an instant regret started to grow inside. A friend who was outside the building\
  \ shakenly said: \"I think someone is here\". It wasn't too soon before we heard\
  \ a car circle past the building across the lane from us.  \n\nHesitation was the\
  \ collective action; the car had now slowed to a stop outside the building we were\
  \ in. Now or never was the only thought in my head. I whispered to my friends \"\
  We need to run\" I didn't know who was out there, but knew it couldn't be good.\
  \ Hearts racing, all of us started running down the weed-covered road, laced with\
  \ potholes, dodging rusty old barbed wire along the way, in the background you could\
  \ hear incoherent German. It felt like something out of the movies, we managed to\
  \ get off the property over the fence we had come through. At last, after fifteen\
  \ minutes of winding down, it was decided that we were in the clear. It was unexplainable\
  \ the feeling of guilt I felt in this moment. \n\nA leap into the unknown turned\
  \ into a learning experience about the foolishness that comes with venturing into\
  \ dangerous parts of the world. It wasn't too long before an Uber was back to pick\
  \ us up, with a kind German man who was explained the whole story. Back in the comfort\
  \ of society, this man told us to stick with the normal tourist experiences next\
  \ time and to find ourselves some currywurst. \n\nEver since then my adventures\
  \ have been taken with a strong sense of moral guidance and an added safety precaution,\
  \ but I am more wander-lusted than ever."
