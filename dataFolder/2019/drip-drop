Text: "Sun: rising.\nWind: blowing.\nWater: still, in the bag.\n'Sky water': on my\
  \ face.\n\nWalking past the streets cleaned with rain, the three of us, having our\
  \ last conversation, at least in a while, feeling a not so sudden bite of sadness\
  \ from the quick and melancholic 'good-byes' with guys just 15 minutes ago \u2014\
  \ I thought we couldn't be all into this conversation, a basic sharing of thoughts,\
  \ \u2014 mainly because, I was sure, there were some each one wanted to keep to\
  \ himself.\n\nNeat, pastel houses, regulated, rubbish-free roads and an expected\
  \ calmness of the early morning together made a perfect snippet of a respectable\
  \ middle-sized German town, which Augsburg was. With each step that couldn't be\
  \ imprinted in the solid asphalt we were closer and closer to our train station.\n\
  \nTo depart was sad.\n\nIt was sad to borrow my new friend's waterproof jacket \u2014\
  \ wearing it felt so good \u2014 for the last time. The very feeling of me standing\
  \ outside the hostel with NN, in light legit summer-ended-yesterday rain, having\
  \ one sweater for chilly days (who knew German August could be that cold?) and no\
  \ umbrella (in a short trip? what for?), being given his clothes without a sound\
  \ \u2014 he knew, with a familiar it's-not-the-first-time-I-do-it-'cuz-it-was-me-who-started-it-all\
  \ gesture, that putting this on made me feel safe and significantly lowered my chances\
  \ to catch a cold.\n\nHuman nature is a bit weird, to tell you the truth.\n\nI can't\
  \ remember the landscape well. I can't describe the station geometrically precisely.\
  \ It feels like not my eye but my heart captures the moment.\n...\n\nFrom the moist\
  \ air we slipped into the long train.\n\nYet, the space didn't seem closed or suffocating,\
  \ as in the trains of where I am from. Indeed, the almost-silence was tender to\
  \ ears. As the train ran through the fields, we found out we were almost alone.\n\
  \n'That's what I don't like in our German trains,' said Phillip. 'They are usually\
  \ empty to the extent of becoming economically inefficient. And what about the environment?\
  \ I'd prefer them to be full'.\n\n'Ah, you don't know what you're talking about',\
  \ I thought. Then, I put it somehow more politely.\n\n'I believe a happy medium\
  \ would be perfect'.\n\nRecalling the old, dirty, stifling, stuffed with passengers\
  \ post-Soviet trains I knew well \u2014 the ones that make you uncomfortable right\
  \ when you first step in \u2014 was unwanted and thus omitted.\n\nI knew the trip\
  \ was to be short, and we had 40 or something minutes until Munich to nicely wrap\
  \ our whole 6-day experience up.\n\nNN put on a sleeping mask to take a nap before\
  \ her flight. The space so seemed to have grown even bigger \u2014 as if putting\
  \ empty sheets of paper between the two of us, for each to fill in with final remarks.\n\
  \nIn a bluish morning light we talked about this and that. We had almost no time\
  \ left, so everything felt important and not worth mentioning at the same time.\n\
  \n'Oh, my wishes for you! I totally forgot', he smiled and gave me a small piece\
  \ of paper with hardly identified handwriting. It was indeed a tradition to leave\
  \ such notes for each other as a reminder of happy times.\n\nHe had already got\
  \ mine earlier ('Oh, you wrote so much! I guess I need time to read it haha'), so\
  \ it was my turn for compliments and nice words then.\n\nI started reading, pausing\
  \ to ask for every second word (the handwriting, yeah). My heart meanwhile felt\
  \ warm. I smiled, maybe, blushed. A message was simple and sincere.\n\n'I am grateful\
  \ for all our time. I really like you', he said, this time out loud.\n\n...\n\n\
  The subway is where we were to separate. I was heading to the airport, NN was to\
  \ meet someone in the city before her flight, and Phillip was going to stay there\
  \ for a couple of days. I didn't know how a crowded space could be [that] intimate,\
  \ I was emotional as always. We got close, our shaking voices said it all. The last\
  \ tight hug was when my train came.\n\n'Take care! See you somewhere in Europe!'\n\
  \nI stepped in.\n\n...\n\nCould I stay?"
