Text: "I collected my check-in baggage after arriving at the Riyadh airport and started\
  \ walking towards the exit while thinking how the world outside the doors of the\
  \ airport would be! When I agreed to come for an assignment in Riyadh on short notice,\
  \ I barely got time to gather information about the culture and people here. I simply\
  \ had the basic idea of Saudi Arabia as a conservative country and regulated society.\n\
  \nA conversation with a co-passenger on flight about the ban on variety of things\
  \ including alcohol generated anxiety in me about whether I would love spending\
  \ my time here. It was also very shocking for me that there is segregation of gender\
  \ at events and restaurants. But most importantly, I was curious about my social\
  \ do\u2019s and don\u2019ts to follow which I had heard about while living in this\
  \ country. Men wearing white long shirts and women wearing black gowns at the airport\
  \ started giving me an idea about the attire of people here.\n\nAs I came outside\
  \ lost in my thoughts, I could hear a warm voice calling me repeatedly by the name\
  \ of a famous Bollywood actor.  And for most time of my stay, it was always like\
  \ that, everyone calling me by that name owing to the popularity of Bollywood, and\
  \ being very cooperative and inviting. That\u2019s exactly how I have found Riyadh\
  \ to be, people and culture quite different from the place I belong but very polite,\
  \ friendly and welcoming to a guest from another country.\n\nAfter reaching my place\
  \ of stay, I decided to hit to the nearest mart to grab some essentials only to\
  \ find out that it is closed for next 20 mins because it\u2019s an official prayer\
  \ time.\n\n5 times a day for 20 mins each, people in Saudi Arabia leave aside their\
  \ work, office, shops and go to the mosque for prayers. The nation literally stops\
  \ all the activity. It is an interesting to watch everyone stop doing whatever he\
  \ is occupied with and walk to the nearest mosque to do their prayers. Initially,\
  \ it was very difficult for me because the restaurants, shops, office work, almost\
  \ everything would be closed and many-a-times I had to wait if I forgot to look\
  \ at the timing!\n\nInitially I presumed that people do their prayers because it\
  \ is mandatory, but to my surprise I witnessed something unusual when I was travelling\
  \ with a Saudi friend to a nearby place. We were in the middle of a desert travelling\
  \ on a dusty road with no sign of person or car around. Looking at his watch, he\
  \ stopped his car. \u201CIt\u2019s time. I need to pray\u201D he said as he came\
  \ out of the car and went to nearby shed to perform his prayer. I looked around,\
  \ there was no one in that desert. It could not occur to me why anyone could be\
  \ so disciplined about praying especially there is no one to check on you. I kept\
  \ pondering on this question the whole day. Later at dinner, while sitting crossed\
  \ legged on a mat, savoring the delicious Arabic food, I asked him casually about\
  \ the reason for his prayer. He laughed and said \u201CPrayer is for your own mind,\
  \ to make you realize that you are much important than your money and other worldly\
  \ possessions\u201D\n\n\nIt\u2019s fascinating how as a society they have given\
  \ more importance for spirituality over the materialistic aspects of life. What\
  \ intrigues me more is the possible benefits of such habit on mental health. When\
  \ the rest of the world is hosting a rat race for materialistic things and when\
  \ competition has fueled less regard to human aspect of life, it will be interesting\
  \ to see how this country would be able to continue with this practice."
