Text: "I had spent the weeks after my stepfather\u2019s funeral anxious about the\
  \ trip, which I\u2019d booked months before; before I\u2019d had any warning the\
  \ cancer would come back and rip through him so quickly. \n\n\u2018I completely\
  \ understand,\u2019 Lara reassured me down the phone from her scorching Dubai balcony.\
  \ \u2018Only come if you can.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t until the morning I was due\
  \ to fly that I decided to make the journey from my dark, cramped flat, dishes piling\
  \ up in the kitchen, to Gatwick Airport. \n\nPorto is split into halves by the Douro\
  \ River which runs broad between them. Pastel-coloured opposing slopes are joined\
  \ by the Dom Luis Bridge which stretches like a spare leg of the Eiffel Tower. We\
  \ could see its arch from the window of our terracotta apartment. \n\nAfter several\
  \ past\xE9is de nata washed down with strong coffee, we began our slow meander through\
  \ the steep, narrow streets of the Old Town. The light darted and funnelled around\
  \ corners and behind everything hung the rattle of yellow trams. \n\nI wasn\u2019\
  t myself; I\u2019d barely spoken and every now and then Lara placed the flat of\
  \ her hand on the small of my back. \n\nI heard the shouting before we turned the\
  \ corner to the sun-filled square, where, from adjacent balconies two women were\
  \ screaming and pointing at each other with the fury of sworn enemies. We understood\
  \ only a handful of words in Portuguese, but slipped into the shadow of a doorway\
  \ to listen to the torrent of their voices. Something about their rage appealed\
  \ to me.\n\nAs we emerged onto the boulevards which lined the river, the city rose\
  \ crooked behind us and we arched our necks to look at what we\u2019d have to later\
  \ climb. White tablecloths of the waterfront restaurants billowed in the salty-breeze\
  \ and performance artists drew crowds with their noise and colour. We spent the\
  \ afternoon drinking glass after glass of local green wine and lazing over plates\
  \ of just-caught bacalhau. \n\nPretty soon, our conversation returned to the argument,\
  \ taking turns to invent stories of unfaithful husbands and stolen customers.\n\n\
  A woman with clouds of black hair leant over from the adjacent table. \n\n\u2018\
  But the Portuguese are external people. You English keep everything inside. It\u2019\
  s more honest our way, no?\u2019 \n\nThe woman, who turned out to be Ana, waited\
  \ with a raised eyebrow for our response. And for a few hours it was the three of\
  \ us. \n\nAs the sun went down the waiter lit candles, brought more wine. Lara went\
  \ home but I decided to stay with Ana. We went dancing in a near-empty bar and,\
  \ for a while, I lost myself in tinny electronic music and cheap drinks. \n\nMuch\
  \ later she found me sitting in the corner. The great sadness in me had won. \n\n\
  She spoke passionately of the city\u2019s social deprivation which forced the young\
  \ to move down the coast to vibrant Lisbon or for tourist work in the popular South.\
  \ But, and there was ease in her voice, \u2018I enjoy Porto,\u2019 she said with\
  \ palpable fondness.\u2018How is life in England?\u2019 \n\nNormally I\u2019d have\
  \ nodded, muttered a \u2018fine\u2019, but I opted for honesty. It was a slow confession\
  \ and my first experience of how easy it can be to tell a stranger the truth. She\
  \ listened to every word with her hands clasped gently in her lap. \n\nAs I walked\
  \ home alone on the tram tracks to our apartment, I half-expected to hear sailors\
  \ singing shanties as they sucked clams from their shells and untangled their fishing\
  \ nets on the river banks below. \n\nI thought of the tile in my mother\u2019s kitchen,\
  \ the pressed blue of its broken shells, which my stepfather had bought here, years\
  \ before. Now I could imagine him finding it in the bustling market, the morning\
  \ after drinking port, smoking and talking to locals in the shadowy caves across\
  \ the water. \n\nMy talk with Ana had left me brighter, less numb, and after climbing\
  \ the punishing hill, I stopped on the Dom Luis to look over the city. I imagined\
  \ him standing here too, watching the river curve beyond his line of vision until\
  \ its boundaries lapsed, wondering what lay beyond them."
