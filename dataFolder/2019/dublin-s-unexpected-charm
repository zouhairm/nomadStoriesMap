Text: "In what could easily be a rom-com plot, when I was \u201Con the edge of seventeen\u201D\
  \ as Stevie Nicks would sing, I had a giant crush on a young and very blond Irish\
  \ sailor. I think it was the first time in my then short life that I broke my own\
  \ \u201CI do not like blondes\u201D rule. Although thoroughly romantic, we promised\
  \ to meet at his next port of St. Thomas \u2013 and we did, this story does not\
  \ have a happy ending, because I never saw each other again after that (I think\
  \ his next regatta was in New England). Although he came to the Caribbean in search\
  \ of adventure, I was the one who was always eager to know his mythical land, where\
  \ the rainbow must end (or start?), the people are supposed to be very lucky (although\
  \ a deep look at the history of the country would suggest otherwise), you toast\
  \ with whiskey (Sl\xE1inte!) and you can find four-leaf clovers: Ireland.\n\nBy\
  \ then I already knew a mythical rock band from Dublin, who sang about violence\
  \ in Northern Ireland, mentioned Martin Luther King, Jr. in their songs and were\
  \ already idols for me: U2. In other words, Ireland already lived in my dream destinations\
  \ of \u2018someday\u2019. Someday took a while to get here. It was only this year\
  \ that the stars aligned for the visit to materialize. I figured supposed I would\
  \ like it. I did not anticipate that I would fall madly in love.\n\nIt was a coincidence\
  \ that I found out that some very good friends were going to be there, so then I\
  \ made plans to meet up with them. There are many places that I have visited \u2013\
  \ and very much enjoyed, by myself. But Dublin is much more fun with friends (although\
  \ I dare to guarantee that, even if you are alone, you would make friends there),\
  \ so this was a happy twist of fate.\n\nDespite having a complicated and long-suffering\
  \ history, being a country founded by Vikings, but at the same time being relatively\
  \ young (it only became an independent republic on December 29, 1937), its capital,\
  \ Dublin, is an infinitely cheerful city. On any the day that you decide to explore\
  \ its streets, you will find live music of all types: typical Irish, hard rock,\
  \ dive bars, current pop music with an Irish flair, in short, something for all\
  \ tastes. You can toast with a good Irish whiskey or try their world-famous beers.\
  \ This is not to say that Dublin is simply a party town; on the contrary, it has\
  \ such a rich history that it takes several days to go through everything you need\
  \ to know and see when you visit it. And that\u2019s just Dublin. If you visit the\
  \ whole island, you should visit Cork, the cliffs of Limerick, Killarney, Blarney\
  \ Castle\u2026 you\u2019ll get lost in its green landscapes and in a topography\
  \ unlike any I\u2019ve seen in the world. Today will tell you about Dublin, the\
  \ capital city, a cradle of musicians, dramatists and writers, and Galway, a coastal\
  \ city on the western coast of Ireland that is about a three-hour drive from Dublin.\
  \ I missed so much to see! But as I was planning my first trip to Europe, one of\
  \ my very best friend\u2019s dad, who worked for many, many years in his own travel\
  \ agency, told me \u201CWhen you go to Europe, always go thinking that you will\
  \ return. If not, you will be overwhelmed because you\u2019re going to want to see\
  \ so many things, that you\u2019re not going to see anything well\u201D. Thank you,\
  \ Don Roberto, for that great piece of advice that I have applied ever since.\n\n\
  So, let\u2019s get down to business, what to do in Dublin? Before leaving, I asked\
  \ a college professor of mine who lives in Europe and he told me \u201Cthe best\
  \ thing to do in Dublin is to get out of Dublin\u201D. Well, I have to disagree.\
  \ While the West Coast and the Wild Atlantic Way are truly impressive landscapes,\
  \ getting lost in the cobblestone streets of the capital city is an attraction in\
  \ itself. As for any European destination, wear comfortable shoes. So that you don\u2019\
  t end up like me, basically stealing tennis shoes from my travel mate pretty much\
  \ for the duration of our trip. You\u2019re going to walk and walk and well, you\
  \ do not cross the Atlantic to go to sleep! The good thing about traveling with\
  \ like-minded but flexible friends is that you do not necessarily have to do everything\
  \ together at exactly the same time, all the time. For example, do you know which\
  \ is the number 1 tourist attraction in all of Ireland? No, it\u2019s not the Cliffs\
  \ of Moher or Blarney Castle; it is the Guinness Brewery tour. It is said it is\
  \ because of the beautiful views of the city from the rooftop, but let\u2019s be\
  \ honest, it\u2019s the most famous Irish beer in the world! And in Ireland, you\
  \ can find good beer and good whiskey. And a good song that talks about whiskey\
  \ and beer! In addition to comfortable shoes, to visit Irish pubs, I recommend learning\
  \ a classic song from The Dubliners, an Irish folk group founded in Dublin in 1962,\
  \ responsible for making Irish music known throughout the rest of Europe: The Wild\
  \ Rover. After a night in Dublin, you will already know the chorus and when and\
  \ how you should clap. It says in part: \u201CI\u2019ve been a wild rover for many\
  \ years and I\u2019ve spent all of my money on whiskey and beer / But now I\u2019\
  m returning with gold in great store / And I never will play the wild rover no more\
  \ \u2026 \u201C. You could spend entire nights bar hopping in the city and I guarantee\
  \ that you will sing this song more times than you will care to remember."
