Text: "I remember the way the summer breeze fell through the olive trees whilst I\
  \ was under the Roman sun.\nSurrounded by once the worlds greatest empire was now\
  \ stuck ruins which was the Imperial Forum.\nI decided to leave the seat under the\
  \ olive tree made of marble and to head to the balcony.\nGazing out upon it all\
  \ looking around me as the hollow auditorium of my chest began to expand I couldn\u2019\
  t help but feel nothing but gratitude because my heart and eyes could not believe\
  \ my dream came true.\nI saw it all and took it all in which was the beauty and\
  \ exciting historical landmarks of Italy from the fields of yellow flowers in Tuscany\
  \ to the bluest waters of the Amalfi Coast to the volcanic ruins of Pompeii to the\
  \ Vatican the remarkable Sistine Chapel to the Coliseum, Trevi Fountain and Imperial\
  \ Forum all the things I dreamed of seeing my entire life I finally saw.\nAs I was\
  \ reflecting and taking in all the beauty surrounded by me at once I felt like I\
  \ was running out of time and all I wanted to do was stay forever.\nAs I left the\
  \ imperial Forum I realised the streets of Rome was an endless stream of beautiful\
  \ chaos a stream of humanity flooding the streets, seemingly endless traffic, a\
  \ horse and carriage whilst musicians playing music for money on the side walks\
  \ you can\u2019t help but feel at one with the culture.\nThere was nowhere I\u2019\
  d rather be than on the streets of Rome soaking it all in, the life this city had\
  \ to offer me.\nSo sad I had to leave the next day but my dearest Italia you\u2019\
  ll always be in my heart forever."
