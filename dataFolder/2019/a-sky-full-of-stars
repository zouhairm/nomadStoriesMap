Text: "When I decided to travel to Sana, a little village hidden between Macae's mountains,\
  \ 4 hours away from Rio, I thought I knew what I was getting myself into. A place\
  \ filled with waterfalls, no phone reception and less than 500 people may not seem\
  \ like the best place to spend New Year's Eve in, but it was one of the best experiences\
  \ I've ever had. The best part of it, thought, wasn't the things I've mentioned,\
  \ but something that wasn't on the travel guides or comments from travelers: the\
  \ sky. \nSo beautiful that it felt unreal, the stars painted every single part of\
  \ the sky, sparkling like I've never seen in my life. Shooting stars suddenly became\
  \ normal - if you stared at the sky for more than 20 seconds, it was certain to\
  \ see a few -, and it was almost imposible to look somewhere else. While walking\
  \ around the small town, passing through the one bakery and one drugstore they had,\
  \ watching the artwork hanging from wallks and beautiful paintings on the floor,\
  \ the sky was always what I yearned to look at. \nThose stars lit up a fire inside\
  \ me I thought was already on. It made me realize how small we are in this huge\
  \ world. It made me want to travel more, to know different places and, mostly, made\
  \ me want to look at the sky in every single angle possible on Earth. Before I check\
  \ all those perspectives, I can guarantee: Sana's the most beautiful one yet."
