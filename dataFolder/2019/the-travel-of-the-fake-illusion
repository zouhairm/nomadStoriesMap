Text: "I bought the plane tickets without thinking, the only thing that mattered me\
  \ was to see him. I knew that once that I arrive in Basel, it would take me an hour\
  \ to see him, however, it was not like that. I arrived alone to a place I had never\
  \ planned, without knowing the language and without having an idea of what I could\
  \ find there. After 13 hours of flight crossing the Atlantic without sleeping, I\
  \ finally arrived.\nAs I could, I asked in English how could I get to Freigburg.,\
  \ the cold reached my bones when I left the airport, I had never felt such a hard\
  \ winter, but other people did not seem to mind the cold wind that hit their cheeks.\
  \ \nI took a bus to the main train station. When I arrived and looked around, I\
  \ saw how the messages came alive with all the instructions that he had given me,\
  \ there was a bridge, park and church. \nAt the hostel, I felt calm but, at the\
  \ same time, I spent the saddest new year eve, far away from my family and friends,\
  \ waiting for him at phone.\nFinally, four days later he arrived. I was scared because\
  \ I had not seen him in 12 years but, when we saw us, I felt peace and his smile\
  \ calmed my fears. We walked by the cobbled streets of Freiburg crunching the snow.\
  \ \nI have to say that all days, upon waking up there was a breakfast waiting for\
  \ me at the table, some scrambled eggs, German sausage, bacon, coffee and toast\
  \ with butter and French strawberry jam, my favorite. That really made my days happy,\
  \ followed by a warm kiss.\nThe days passed in calm, I used to travel by tram, and\
  \ I remember how I hated the drastic temperature changes in it. Outside the temperature\
  \ was below zero and inside it was 25 degrees Celsius, it was like going from winter\
  \ to spring in a couple of seconds. I also remember that I used to smile at people\
  \ although most of them did not get me a smile back.\nThe city was always quiet,\
  \ and a white landscape covered \"the black forest\". Those places seem at the same\
  \ time new and well known because he used to send me photos of them.\nI could not\
  \ make friends there, my only company was him, but I did not need more. He made\
  \ me feel safe, I\u2019m proud and admire him, he was my voice in all the places\
  \ that we visited. He surprised me with his ability to speak in four languages.\
  \ I felt so bad for just speak one. \nI\u2019m not a good traveler. Travelers fall\
  \ in love of their trips and I fell in love with him, however, in our last date,\
  \ with a snowy landscape, he told me that he doesn\u2019t want a commitment, he\
  \ doesn\u2019t believe in long distance relationship.\nThat moment was like a slap\
  \ that hit me even stronger than the icy wind of the first day in Basel. I cried\
  \ all that night. We had bought tickets to Zurich for the next day, so I forgot\
  \ the words of the previous night and I took his hand, next to him everything seemed\
  \ warmer.  The trip was fun, we drank and sang.\nOnce again what I liked the most\
  \ about Zurich were not those bridges, nor those rivers, nor the Fondue, was him,\
  \ his company. The last day of my stay there, I became strong and kept my distance,\
  \ I did not ask for anything in return, I was still broken. \nI can\u2019t understand\
  \ why he didn't know that neither Germany, nor Switzerland nor France were the reasons\
  \ for my trip. Everything ended with a brief hug, a phone full of photos, and a\
  \ mind trying to explain why things happened in that way. \nHe makes me feel like\
  \ home, he makes my soul feels happy. This wasn't my dream travel with a happy ending,\
  \ but it let me know that for love don't matter cross an ocean or being in a new\
  \ land. Love needs a brain that doesn\u2019t overthink too much and his brain has\
  \ a chronic overthinking"
