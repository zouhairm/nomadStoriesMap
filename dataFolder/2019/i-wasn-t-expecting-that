Text: "As much as I hate to admit it, my ideas of Jordan were partially based on an\
  \ array of stereotypes. The generalised and preconceived notions of the Middle East\
  \ being dangerous, scary and a place where a 21 year old female should not visit\
  \ sat in the back of my mind. \n\nHaving travelled before I knew that all of this\
  \ wouldn't be true, but how different it would be I was completely blind to. \n\n\
  We stood there gawking up at the building that is Petra. It\u2019s magnificence\
  \ emphasised by the incredible Siq or softly carved walls leading up to it. It was\
  \ surprisingly peaceful. For a place where I thought hundreds of tourists would\
  \ gather, stood only 15, snapping photos before moving further into the ancient\
  \ city. \n\nThis is where we met the Bedouins. Whilst the B\u2019doul no longer\
  \ live in the city of Petra, it\u2019s easy to believe that they still do. Running\
  \ tours such as donkey and camel rides, their attachment to the city is as bold\
  \ and clear as their eyeliner.\n\nIt was when we were bartering that I came to realise\
  \ that just like any other tourist destination, I was on guard. Trying to ensure\
  \ we didn't get scammed, I stood back and watched my friend barter with them in\
  \ Arabic. Happily, I was taken aback. This wasn't the kind of encounter where people\
  \ yelled out and over one another or have an underlying aggressive tone. Instead,\
  \ they looked more like two friends trying to reach an agreement.\n\nFrom friends\
  \ and photos, we knew that there was a way to see Petra from above. Maybe it was\
  \ because of Instagrams influence or my genuine love of heights but my skin crawled\
  \ with excitement. Now, with a 14 year old guide, we were able to navigate the rocky\
  \ passage. \n\nThe view from above captures the Treasury\u2019s calmness and stature.\
  \ With rugs laid on the edge of the cliffs, it is a trip worthwhile so long as you\
  \ can make it back down. This proved more scary for some as we past grown men giggling\
  \ and screaming whilst their teenage guides bounced from ledge to ledge down the\
  \ gorge. \n\nAfter dark we visited Petra by night, a spectacle that is special in\
  \ ways I didn't expect. The flashy coloured lights didn't do it for me but rather\
  \ sitting in a group, listening to music in a language older than Arabic with a\
  \ dog nestling into my leg was what was special. \n\nWondering around and peering\
  \ at the hundreds of candles after the show I felt a tap on the shoulder. \u2018\
  \u2018Watermelon seeds\u2019\u2019 a voice asked followed by an open hand. Admittedly,\
  \ I was startled. I turned to see the boys from earlier that day, not there as tour\
  \ guides but there as friends. \n\nHere, on my fourth day of visiting Jordan the\
  \ kind and friendly nature of the people once again through the two young men. \
  \ They took our photos and held our wallets whilst we posed, laughed and admired\
  \ the scenes around us. The fear I had of the danger this country held suddenly\
  \ felt silly. This is not to say to trust everyone, I have had enough bad experiences\
  \ to know otherwise. But rather, how destructive stereotypes can be and how freeing\
  \ it is to see people as people, as individuals before all else.\n\nThe Bedouin\
  \ people of Petra were not who I expected to connect with arriving in Jordan. Nor\
  \ did I expect to feel such care from a man selling tea on the side of the road,\
  \ or the shopkeeper who offered us cold drinks when he saw us sweating. Stereotypes\
  \ are perpetual, they exist. As travellers, it is our responsibility to experience\
  \ a place without letting these hinder our views. \n\nBy visiting Jordan I was reminded\
  \ of the deeper connection you make to people when you include the element of trust.\
  \ I was reminded to actively separate stereotypes from my perspective and how much\
  \ better the world can be when we trust and understand one another. I don't know\
  \ what I was expecting to experience in Jordan. I do know however it was so much\
  \ better than I could have ever imagined."
