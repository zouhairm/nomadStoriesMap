Text: "Lisse did not speak for a month after her husband died. He fell to the floor\
  \ one day after doing some shopping, and never got up. Her daughter, whom she could\
  \ not recognize, had to admit her into a mental institution. \u201CI felt like I\
  \ had been hit by a shock grenade\u201D, she described. Slowly, she began to fix\
  \ her eyes again, and with time, she regained speech. But when she got home, she\
  \ could not stand it. Her husband had been an architect, and had built that house\
  \ for them, just as they had dreamed for many years. Then, she sold the house and\
  \ flew from Denmark, her home country, to Norway, where she lived in a convent for\
  \ six months. When that experience was over, she decided to go to Cuba and learn\
  \ Spanish. And that is where we met.\n\u201CExcuse me, can you help me get to this\
  \ street?\u201D a woman asked a Cuban boy in the streets of Trinidad. He looked\
  \ confused and stared at the card before trying to explain, in Spanish, how to get\
  \ to the address.\n\u201CI don\u2019t understand!\u201D She protested, still in\
  \ English. Some locals in the street laughed. I walked to her and offered my help,\
  \ since I had a map. \n\u201CI get so lost in this city, I\u2019ve been looking\
  \ for my hostel for ages!\u201D she explained. What she called a hostel was actually\
  \ a beautiful colonial house in which the owners rented a room, as many families\
  \ in Cuba do. I ended up walking with her to her Casa Particular, while she told\
  \ me that she had had an awful time in Havana, and this was her first day in Trinidad.\
  \ She was fascinated: the colorful buildings, the narrow cobblestone roads, the\
  \ calm. The dim light cast by the sunset made Trinidad a magical place. When we\
  \ came to her doorstep, she was really thankful, and suggested we should eat something\
  \ together after she took a shower.\nLisse already had a favorite caf\xE9 in Trinidad.\
  \ It was near Plaza Mayor, and it had enchanting Christmas lights hanging from the\
  \ trees. We ordered two mojitos and started talking. A twenty-four-year-old girl\
  \ from Chile on her first solo journey, and a woman in her sixties from Denmark,\
  \ both speaking in English even when it was neither our mother tongue nor the language\
  \ spoken in Cuba. Still, it was the meeting point.\nWhen Lisse arrived from Norway\
  \ to Denmark, she spoke to a distant friend of hers, who happened to know someone\
  \ in Cuba. She recommended a Spanish program that lasted eight months and told her\
  \ she would find accommodation for her in Havana. But when Lisse arrived at the\
  \ house, the trouble began. Her room was humid, and the walls covered by moss. Also,\
  \ the house was really far from the city center, so she couldn\u2019t go anywhere\
  \ walking, which led to her feeling isolated and depressed. On her eighth day in\
  \ Cuba, she got really sick, and had to go to the hospital.\nDue to her condition,\
  \ she missed the first week of the course, and decided she was not capable of staying\
  \ where she was for eight months. She wrote to her friend, saying the house was\
  \ terrible and that she had to leave soon, but she got no reply. So, she decided\
  \ to go back to Denmark, forget all about Cuba, and plan another adventure. \n\u201C\
  I actually had a plane ticket for today\u201D, Lisse smiled over her half-empty\
  \ mojito, and added \u201CI met a couple from my country, who insisted I could not\
  \ leave thinking Havana was Cuba. That I had to see other cities. And that\u2019\
  s why I\u2019m here. I changed the plane ticket and extended my stay for two more\
  \ weeks. It was by far the best decision\u201D.  \nWhen Lisse finished her mojito,\
  \ she confessed: \u201CI think that this friend of mine hates me. She had always\
  \ been in love with my husband. She was sure he was the man of her life. So, she\
  \ set me a trap in Havana. If she could see me now, enjoying life here in Trinidad.\
  \ I know he always loved only me\u201D."
