Text: "Insatiability led me to the single-maned Bangladino.  Overheated from the Sicilian\
  \ sun, I was a temporary resident in his dimly lit shop. Both slightly curious about\
  \ our similar complexion and evidently foreign Italian accents, I had to ask about\
  \ saudade.  Saudade as I explained, is a Brazilian word that describes a profound\
  \ melancholic longing for something.  There are no words in English that can capture\
  \ this emotion, but maybe in its Latin relative, it\u2019s essence would persist.\
  \ Surely the global political climate evoked this deep emotion across oceans, like\
  \ a wave of smog creeping across the sand.  But in our microcosm, he debunked an\
  \ entire misconception through the subtlest adages. \n\t\u201CThis is my home now\u201D\
  \ - said in the most romantic languages spoken in the world.  With conviction, it\
  \ encapsulated the ethos of the land. Sicily was a place that absorbed, understood,\
  \ and loved.  Deep-rooted in its past, the island exuded fragments of cultures and\
  \ stories that forever left their mark. It's inhabitants had a mutual understanding\
  \ with the land.  In some unspoken agreement, they seemed devoted to find a way\
  \ to give back the abundance the island had given them. \n\t\u201CI am Sicilian\u201D\
  \ - was his next comment, which felt neither forced nor feigned. His conviction\
  \ had the undertone of centuries of wisdom, which through time were able to dispel\
  \ the notion of nostalgia. Conscious of my non-existent poker face, I tried to grasp\
  \ the simplicity of the argument.  It was one predicated on the kindness of humanity,\
  \ found on the pearl of the Mediterranean.  But this idea had been pummeled to the\
  \ ground and cast away. It's resilience was reasserted by individuals like him,\
  \ that forge paths and by building tiny steps into the future. \nWe thanked each\
  \ other for the chat, and I exited his shop.  He stayed, providing a home for any\
  \ wandering traveler listening for truths."
