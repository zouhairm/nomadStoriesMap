Text: "The English film About Time tells the story of a young man who discovers that\
  \ he has the power to go back in time, in the beginning such fact is regarded by\
  \ the character as a divine gift for resolutions of his problems, but throughout\
  \ the narrative he realizes that such  act causes several negative changes in his\
  \ life, passing the moral lesson to all interlocutors that life should be lived\
  \ at all time because it is brief and short.\n   Unfortunately the current society\
  \ is registered in a cybernetic context and is  always worried about the next story\
  \ or post in Instagram, not really enjoying life the way it is. The Internet ends\
  \ up having a strong influence in the life of the individual, including in their\
  \ social and political choices and even in the destination of travel. A good example\
  \ is the Maldives Islands, a road map until 2 years ago unknown that today becomes\
  \ the most desired destination for influence of celebrities and personal influencers.\
  \ Most people no longer travel to see a historical place such as the Roman ruins\
  \ or the medieval castles scattered throughout Europe, there is always the virtual\
  \ question behind many trips, whether in the restaurant that all the bloggers go\
  \ to in Paris or the a nightclub frequented by celebrities in Los Angeles.\n  When\
  \ I was 6 years old a Geography teacher declared the group during a tour that we\
  \ all lived a trip once, for all this seems to be a logical preposition but for\
  \ that little girl of 6 years such  phrase was a watershed and also a great lesson,\
  \ which would reflect directly on how the world would come, with such a phrase popping\
  \ up in my mind over the years and being of fundamental importance in my growth\
  \ as a person.\n  A good example of such  lesson is the memory of a car trip at\
  \ age 12 with my parents for  the birthplace of their relatives. At that time the\
  \ town was small, it could be considered a village, my grandmother was still alive,\
  \ I spent a week getting to know a lot of people, there was a foot of blackberry\
  \ which I ate at least 15 every day during my stay, besides the fact I got on so\
  \ well with a cousin that I had never seen. Today I find myself wondering just how\
  \ unique it was to such a trip, because we will never live a moment again. Currently\
  \ the city looks the same in its physical form but it is like if it were a totally\
  \ different place for me. My parents divorced, so the trip was only my father and\
  \ I, since I am already qualified I was the driver, my grandmother is no longer\
  \ alive, my cousin does not live there anymore because she went to college in another\
  \ city and the foot of blackberry no longer exists, leaving only the good memories\
  \ and longings of the last trip and the structuring of new memories with the new\
  \ trip made to the place. And in the future I will be able to return to the city\
  \ with my husband and my children who knows, or else in a more distant future I\
  \ will still be able to return without the presence of my father, with only the\
  \ memories in my head, cause  this is the cycle of life.\n  So  we should always\
  \ make the most of each place visited because it is not possible to go back in time\
  \ as the character of About time because the only thing that belongs to us are the\
  \ memories. A place will never be the same twice because we are constantly changing.\
  \ Every trip should be used as much as possible because as said by my professor\
  \ of Geofrafia she will be unique. Meet new people, make friends, try typical dishes,\
  \ visit tourist points, take a day without a script so that you get lost and dive\
  \ deep in the city, finding in the future your own favorite place and living your\
  \ experience. Finally live every moment."
