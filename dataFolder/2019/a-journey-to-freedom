Text: One night scrolling through my social apps my roommate walked into my room and
  told me he was planning to go on a trek to Kalawantin near mumbai. He had plans
  with  his other friends and another roommate of mine.. All of a sudden the other
  one canceled his plan and i was persuing him to go within fraction of a second while
  convincing him i decided that i would go on the trek.. And that so far was the best
  decision i ever made.. We started off early morning the next day and reached Panvel
  around 6 and began our trekking at 7.. The nature heals everything.. Amidst the
  mountains ,the cold winds ,the greenery i found out what i was searching for a long
  time.. PEACE. Whatever happened to me that day made me realize that happiness is
  not in the materialistic world.. All you got to do is what makes you happy.. And
  this trip did.. Even though my legs got sore because the shoes ripped apart.. I
  still wanted to keep going the decision i made at the bottom of the mountain made
  me go with the same zeal for the whole journey.. And the hill top was worth it..
  The silence the serenity.. It calmed my mind.. And made me go for what was going
  to come next...
