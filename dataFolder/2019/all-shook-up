Text: "The wind was fierce that day.  I don't mean the kind of wind that will lift\
  \ your skirt or make you chase a dollar bill down the street. I'm talking: \u2019\
  we're not in Kansas anymore\u2019.  My husband and I had just moved from my home\
  \ in New York to his in Adelaide, Australia.  On a two week road trip in the Blue\
  \ Mountains, a few hours outside Sydney, we hiked to a famous rock formation known\
  \ as The Three Sisters.\n\nWe descended down a fairly steep staircase into the valley\
  \ \u2014 a land of grottos and waterfalls where Eucalyptus oil creates a blue mist.\
  \  The trail reminded me of an Indiana Jones movie, narrow but gentle and exotic,\
  \ missing only a giant bolder speeding toward us. \nThe first two and a half hours\
  \ were a literal walk in the park, and then we arrived at something called \"the\
  \ Giant Stairway\".  It looked old, narrow, and completely perpendicular to the\
  \ ground we were standing on.  Finding out it was old, (built in 1909) narrow (only\
  \ one person could be on the stairs at any given point) and that it was the only\
  \ way to get to the Three Sisters gave us a tiny thrill of excitement typified only\
  \ by tourists who don\u2019t know any better.\n\nWe started our climb up the steel\
  \ and stone steps and the higher up we got, the more intense the wind got.  Halfway\
  \ up I noticed my hands were sweaty, my heart was pumping and I was becoming increasingly\
  \ worried about falling off the staircase.  At the closest rest stop (which is just\
  \ a small landing located every 30 steps or so - to let people pass each other on\
  \ the narrow death ladder) I sat down and looked at Luke.  For a minute I was at\
  \ a loss of words, I mean, what really could I tell him.  Going back wasn't an option,\
  \ we could only continue and finish the 800 steel and stone steps.  I turned to\
  \ Luke and said \"remind me to tell you something when we get to the top\".  Lovingly,\
  \ he played along and said \"ok\".  \n\nWe finally got up to the level of the Three\
  \ Sisters (still not the top of the staircase) and the gusts were swaying Honeymoon\
  \ Bridge which leads from the ladder to just under the first sister.  Tourists can\
  \ cross the bridge and take pictures and selfies on a 300-million-year-old landmark.\
  \  Here is where my trip became really memorable.  I remember thinking, \u201CI\
  \ do not need to cross the bridge, I could send Luke while I stand here with my\
  \ death grip on the railing and anxiously wait and envy him for having this experience,\
  \ rueing myself when we get to the top, or, I think I can quickly make it to the\
  \ other side of the bridge, sit safely on the bench and say that I did everything\
  \ a 300-million-year-old landmark one kilometre above sea level had to offer\u201D\
  .  \n\nI would like to say that after choosing to face my fear I was able to walk\
  \ calmly back over the bridge, up the remainder of the stairs able to slow down\
  \ and enjoy the climb and the view.  In reality I took my shaky legs, my rapid heartbeat\
  \ and my new-found fear of heights up the rest of the stairs as quickly as I could,\
  \ without looking back or down.  After finally ascending to the top of the staircase\
  \ and telling Luke about my deathly fear of heights, (or possibly Ancraophobia,\
  \ the fear of wind) he asked why I hadn\u2019t said something earlier.\n\nThe truth\
  \ is I realized is being afraid doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t do something. I was\
  \ surprised that my fear is still with me.  I didn\u2019t still can\u2019t climb\
  \ the highest mountain without shaking all over but I do know if I really want to\
  \ I will definitely give it a go.\n\nI celebrated at the top with remarkable enthusiasm,\
  \ on solid ground of course, jumping for joy! I even snapped my selfie from the\
  \ safe and secure overlook, with a big smile and the wind blowing my hair across\
  \ my face."
