Text: "I am little bit strange girl. If we speak about travelling you ned to know\
  \ two facts about me. First- normally I am travelling only by busses and trains\
  \ in Europe. I use flight option only when people order me flights. Why busses and\
  \ trains? There are 5 \u201Cbecause\u201D: price, no clues at the airport, no taxi\
  \ from airport (that normally are far from main attractions), real feelings of travelling-\
  \ you know when you skip the boarder, you feel the \u201Ctime\u201D, you see (!)\
  \ all road, you need to plan wisely,  you are more into to meet strangers- actually\
  \ you feel like you are traveller from the XIX century. Like, you also have an option\
  \ to travel and to travel in \u201Ctime\u201D.\n\nSecondly, I have \u201Cpuzzle\
  \ map\u201D principle when I am travelling. What does that mean? Please, imagine\
  \ a map with national borders. Then colour countries that you have been visited.\
  \ (The term \u201Cvisited\u201D is on you). Can you see problem here? I can. Those\
  \ are counties you haven\u2019t. Can you see bigger problem? Those are counties\
  \ you\u2019ve been hooped. Last year for me the hooped one, the missed piece of\
  \ puzzle was Moldova. I\u2019ve been visited Ukraine and I was planned to go to\
  \ Romania. Can you imagine this on map? I NEED to visit Moldova!!! So, I did. And\
  \ this is story about how I did.\n\nThanks to some overslept nights, I realised,\
  \ that there are some days, when bus from Warsaw goes to Chisinau, the capital of\
  \ Moldova. And exactly from my beloved Warsaw West (Zachodnia) bus station. So,\
  \ I ordered bus from Riga to Warsaw West and second one from Zachodnia to Chisinau.\
  \ I waited 3 hours in Warsaw and till the end I couldn\u2019t believe this bus exists.\
  \ So long story short- it\u2019s 14 o\u2019 clock and I am in the bus. I am lucky-\
  \ I have 2 seats I can sleep like in a hostel. Around 30 passengers there are only\
  \ 5 women, including me and another young girl. And only 2 women are travelling\
  \ alone- me and that girl. But she had a Moldavian passport. NERVES AND STRESS increases\
  \ because of the Russian thrillers were shown on TV there. Old bus without WC. But,\
  \ ok, driver is super nice, handsome and quite young. And people are telling a lot\
  \ of personal stories. A lot of them are from mixed families. So about me too, actually.\
  \ Live family stories are worth to jump out your comfort zone, especially when you\
  \ are historian. But not only.\n\nI woke up. Someone says, in 10 minutes we will\
  \ be in Chisinau. I am afraid - I do not know where to go. Yes, I do know about\
  \ google maps. Yes, I had an opportunity to charge my phone in the bus. But no,\
  \ I do not have SO much money to spend on internet.\nOne man from the passengers\
  \ sees, that I am lost. He introduces himself in Russian and orders me a taxi-driver\
  \ service. I agreed. Well, I am young lady travelling alone, why did I? Well, I\
  \ have some \u201Cfeeling\u201D on people. He doesn\u2019t seem so strong. I am\
  \ strong and little bit trained to act in emergencies. Result: he took me to other\
  \ bus stop I wanted to, by his auto (he is a former taxi-driver), he helped me to\
  \ exchange money, to buy ticket for my next destination- Bucharest, helped me to\
  \ leave my luggage in storage room, gave his number for emergency call for only\
  \ 12 euros. He ordered also to took me to the centre, but I wanted to explore city\
  \ by myself.\n\nWhen you do not have Google maps and Internet connection, \u201C\
  local connection\u201D is the best, priceless experience. I meet a lot of people\
  \ just to ask where to go, what to see, what to eat, etc. Almost everyone spoke\
  \ Russian, almost everyone asked about my country, my Latvia. Not everyone really\
  \ knew the answer, bur everyone I talked with, was a part of my puzzle to make memories.\
  \ Trip to Chisinau is one of the best memories I made, but this is the other story\
  \ to tell you."
