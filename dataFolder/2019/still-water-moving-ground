Text: "The wave built toward us, a slate blue wall eclipsing first the craggy cliff\
  \ in the distance and then the wooden boats tied to makeshift buoys right in front\
  \ of us. I wasn\u2019t ready, but Oza didn\u2019t care. He turned my board to face\
  \ the shoreline and pushed until the wave caught me. I tried to stand up, but my\
  \ foot slipped. I tumbled over, back into the murky blue. I could just see the surface\
  \ and I scratched at it, but my board yanked me further under. When the ocean stilled\
  \ and my surfboard lazily floated back toward me, I wanted to scream at it, rip\
  \ it from my bandaged foot and let it float out to sea. Instead, I got back on and\
  \ paddled toward the beginning. \nOza was waiting for me there, and he signaled\
  \ for me to sit up next to him and relax. I gave him by best approximation of a\
  \ smile. Oza\u2019s board was longer than him at barely five feet, though he looked\
  \ much older than his height might suggest; years of sitting under an overbearing\
  \ sun.\n\u201CThat was a lot,\u201D I said. \n\u201CYour first time, you do well.\u201D\
  \ \nI looked out toward the oncoming set of waves, these ones bigger than the last.\
  \ \nBefore I could respond, Oza turned me around and pushed me into the swell. This\
  \ time I body surfed the whole way. When I reached the shoreline, my knees were\
  \ stiff with salt and I was shaking all over. \n\n I hadn\u2019t planned to learn\
  \ to surf in Lombok.\n\nThe night of the earthquake, I was eating dinner on the\
  \ beach. This lesser known island in Indonesia was my last stop before heading home.\
  \ I was pulling apart my barbecued red snapper when my chair started to shake. I\
  \ remember thinking the stray cats must have been fighting for scraps under my chair\
  \ until I saw the pool at the hotel next door crack open like a chest cavity, its\
  \ contents gushing into the sand. I laid down and gripped the earth as if it were\
  \ trying to shake itself rid of me. Four hundred people died and almost every home\
  \ in northern Lombok was destroyed. Still, I lived, and though the dirt under my\
  \ nails stayed there for months, I was unharmed. \n\nOne day later I made my way\
  \ farther south to Kuta with a band of travelers, where the aftershocks were less\
  \ intense. Aboard a van of locals who\u2019d agreed to take a few of us down, we\
  \ pooled our guilt with survival stories until our mouths were tired. I felt ashamed\
  \ by our conversation while the locals pointed out their flattened homes as they\
  \ drove us. With tears in my eyes I wondered if the most useful thing I could do\
  \ was simply hop a plane. Still, it felt important to stay in Lombok. When I did\
  \ go home, I wanted to be able to do this place more justice than stories of my\
  \ fear could. Thus, on the day after a magnitude seven earthquake, I learned to\
  \ surf. \n\nI paddled back toward Oza again, proud of myself for making progress.\
  \ He looked at me with concerned eyes. \n\u201CYou must let go. Stand up. Trust\
  \ the board.\u201D \n\u201CI don\u2019t know, Oza. I\u2019ve never surfed before.\u201D\
  \ An airplane far overhead spun its white ribbon of cloud across an otherwise unblemished\
  \ blue sky. Oza sighed. \n\u201CIt is not so hard, you have been through worse only\
  \ yesterday, no?\u201D He laughed. I stared at him without blinking and pressed\
  \ my palms into the ocean\u2019s skin. I suddenly felt unmoored, as if I didn\u2019\
  t quite recognize myself anymore. I looked down at the board between my legs and\
  \ imagined that it held someone more capable. All around me it seemed there were\
  \ people who would stand up no matter how many times the ground slid out from underneath\
  \ them. \n\nThe ocean was gun blue, cold, and it made me feel new, like maybe this\
  \ could be who I was from now on, too. Oza turned my board around. Screaming, \u201C\
  Go, Go, Go!\u201D He pushed me into the wave, and I paddled hard without looking\
  \ back."
