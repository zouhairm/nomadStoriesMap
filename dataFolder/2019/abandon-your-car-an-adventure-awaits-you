Text: "I  wasn't a huge fan of commuting, truth be told. The idea of being on a bus\
  \ or train surrounded by strangers was enough to make the vultures in my stomach\
  \ dance like crazy. I didn't like to ride the jeepney--where commuters have to be\
  \ like sardines during rush hours. So imagine my surprise when my mom told me she\
  \ won't drive me to school anymore.\n\nI almost fainted.\n\nThe first few weeks\
  \ of my commuting journey was terrible and horrible. The LRT was filled with a sea\
  \ of unfamiliar faces. We were like sardines in a can. My private space was nowhere\
  \ to be found. It flew out the window together with my serotonin. We were all standing\
  \ so close to one another that we almost switch faces. The ventilation was poor\
  \ and beads of sweat covered my face. The train was as slow as our internet connection.\
  \ I was freaking out the entire ride. \"What did I get myself into?\"\n\nI was grumpy\
  \ every single day. My eyebrows resembled the letter V whenever I get home. I was\
  \ irritated at everything. \n\nBut as the weeks fly faster than the speed of light,\
  \ I realized looking like Hulk for weeks was exhausting. I thought to myself, \"\
  Why don't you look on the bright side? Surely you don't want to be a bitter person\
  \ forever.\".\n\nSo I did.\n\nFrom then on, I spent my commuting hours people-watching.\
  \ What other way to keep yourself sane than watching strangers? \n\nI make up theories\
  \ in my head about what their lives look like. It usually goes like this--maybe\
  \ that old woman with a bag full of candies and chips has a mini canteen. Or perhaps\
  \ that tired looking student wearing glasses that were too big for his face was\
  \ a fan of anime like me. I was bombarded with thousands of theories that I almost\
  \ got late to school. \n\nI never knew commuting could be a fun and fascinating\
  \ journey. It was an eye-opener for me. I took things for granted and never really\
  \ appreciated their worth. But I'm a different person now. I'd get instantly mesmerized\
  \ with the smallest of things. The old me would shiver in horror.\n\nI don't think\
  \ I'd get a driving license anytime soon."
