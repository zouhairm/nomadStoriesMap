Text: "Here I am, divided from my home by this huge body of water, immersed into this\
  \ forever changing and never ending new culture and lifestyle, without having a\
  \ single clue how I got here, all that, and at the same time, feeling right at home.\
  \ People so lovable that they have made me forget my defensive personality, to surender\
  \ myself to love and comprehension and embrace what this new chapter brings. I now\
  \ guide my self with a quote from the danish philosopher S\xF8ren Kierkegaard, \u201C\
  Life can only be understood backward, but it must be lived forwards\u201D. There\
  \ has never been a more objective and influential sentence than this one, I\u2019\
  ve learned to take what life throws at me and I\u2019ve also reshaped my perspective,\
  \ Turing expectations into appreciation and learning to read the small messages.\
  \ I somehow managed to find this ideaa of a trip to portugal, it was something I\
  \ had planned with my closest friends, a new place we\u2019ve never seen before,\
  \ bombarded with street art, and rich in history with beautiful trams which unfold\
  \ into the sea. Sadly because or many unexpected sircunstances we haven\u2019t been\
  \ able to pick a date, as soon as I stumped into this, it meant one of to possiblities,\
  \ either the NSA is checking my browser history, or this really is, a new chapter,\
  \ which I would without a doubt inners mylself into. Thanks, Andr\xE9s."
