Text: 'One day, i and my friend decided to go to bali for a week holiday, for most
  of the people, it was just a normal trip, not for me.. my strict parents, never
  let me go to bali, its far and yes so much vulgal things there, people can say i
  was born in religious muslim family, where woman is not able to walk alone in the
  night, not able to go anywhere except with her husband, not drink alcohol, not cover
  the hairs because they are sins, meanwhile in bali, there are lot a woman using
  bikini, alcohol everywhere, and they are something that unfamiliar for my parents,
  in their mind, it would be hard to find a good food that it accept in muslim, another
  bad things that they created in their mind also and its my first time traveling
  far with my friends, and i had to face my parents a night before i left. It was
  expected, i called them for asking a permission, yes, they didnt let me go, they
  scream, they scared me with lot things, turned me down, they closed the phone, i
  cried alot and wishing that i was like other people, take things and go. I cried
  all night, but then i decided to go and i said to my self "if its not now then when",
  and i just ran from my hostel and go.

  After i arrived in bali, i just called my mom and say i landed safely and she shocked
  and closed the phone suddently.

  It made me sad, at that time i was thinking i wouldnt enjoy my trips at all, i was
  wrong.

  It was incredible time, since i step outside the airport, the locals with unique
  clothes came to me and ask me to rent his car for a day, i was truly amazed to see
  how beautiful bali is, the people the building, because we arrived at morning, we
  could even see the woman prays in front of her home and some the shops and put things
  on the road, i smell unique sesajen "ritual offering" and we headed to our first
  destination tanah lot. It was 8 am in the morning, we see lot people,the woman wears
  kebaya and the man wears "baju safari" a white shirt, and it was unique and obviously
  something new for me where hindu is only in bali, a man there says something in
  bali language and they are praying, in front of beautiful scenery, the ocean and
  if we walk for 5 mins theres a pura on big reaf and under it, there is a pure water
  that they beliefs it can erase the sins. After finish admiring the scenery and taking
  some selfies, we headed back, in way back there are lot local shops sells, everything
  about bali, scarf, clothes, and a wooden hand craft. After that we will go to beratan
  lake that it an hour a way from tanah lot, beratan lake is located above the mountain,
  so while we are going there i have seen so beautiful scenery of bali, the house
  the road, locals there build a prayer place infront of their home, and we arrived
  i felt amazed it was beautiful, a lake that mountains around it, so beautiful and
  i said to my self "if at that time i loose and prefer to stay home, i would be regret
  this in my whole life" i smiled and i have no worries about my parents after i see
  how beautiful bali, it just worth, we stayed there for a week there and there were
  sooo many gorgeous place we visited like ubud, uluwatu, nusa penida and many more.
  I spent most of time enjoying my self smiling and admiring every single place without
  worrying about what my mom will say to me after i back. Thank you bali, you have
  my heart'
