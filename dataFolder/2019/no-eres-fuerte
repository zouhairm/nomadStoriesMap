Text: "I had been living deep in the Guatemalan highlands of Alta Verapaz for some\
  \ time, and felt I was learning the ropes of daily life. I had perfected doing laundry\
  \ in the rocky stream and greeting passers by in their local tongue, Q'eqchi'. I\
  \ had learnt how to make chocolate from our neighbour's cacao beans, and tortillas\
  \ from locally harvested ma\xEDz. I had even discovered that children would point\
  \ and laugh if I wore gumboots to the village, so stuck to my sandals for our weekly\
  \ trips to buy groceries. I had not, however, even begun to grasp the innate knowledge\
  \ - and strength - that comes with being raised and living a life in the jungle.\n\
  \nLocated a 40 minute hike from the nearest road, which was in turn a 30 minute\
  \ truck ride from the village, we lived remotely but comfortably. Thin muddy paths\
  \ and run-down rope bridges led through the jungle to our small settlement; a few\
  \ scattered cabins filled with handmade bunk beds, an open air kitchen complete\
  \ with a fridge and stove run on solar power, as well as hot showers and clean toilets.\
  \ These appliances and materials, luxury items in such a remote setting, did not\
  \ magically appear in this ancient valley. They were carried by local men. I was\
  \ told that one man, Chepe, had carried the refrigerator there by himself - a claim\
  \ so farfetched to me that I assumed exaggeration for the sake of an impressive\
  \ story. I nodded along, not knowing that I would soon see similar feats first hand.\
  \ \n\nGravel was being brought in from the village to create better paths throughout\
  \ the property, and I was eager to lend a hand. First, the bags of gravel were sent\
  \ down the turbulent Cahab\xF3n River on a plastic boat, men on either side steering\
  \ and balancing the load. Next, they were unloaded and carried along a slippery\
  \ path and up the hill to the main house. I waited as the bags were unloaded, and\
  \ watched carefully as the men hauled them onto their backs, leaning forward and\
  \ gripping them from underneath to steady themselves. I grabbed the hessian sack\
  \ and went to follow suit. Nothing happened. The bag didn\u2019t budge. I looked\
  \ up to see Chepe, in his soggy white underpants with a cigarette dangling from\
  \ his mouth. \u201CNo eres fuerte\u201D, he chuckled as he swung another sack onto\
  \ his back and lunged towards the muddy path.\n\nI tried a few more times, but it\
  \ quickly became obvious that I was no help at all. Chepe had done multiple trips\
  \ by the time I gave up, and I made some excuses in broken Spanish as I skulked\
  \ back to the main house. As I pretended to clean, embarrassed at my incompetence,\
  \ it occurred to me that I lacked the basic skills needed to survive in this world.\
  \ Without the internet, I could not Google how to start a fire, or how to treat\
  \ a dog that has ingested toad poison. I couldn\u2019t drive to a hardware store\
  \ and buy a wheelbarrow. I couldn\u2019t call the local council and ask that the\
  \ paths were maintained - this area didn\u2019t even have a single police officer.\
  \ I was like a child, relying on the knowledge and skills others for my very existence.\
  \ I realised that almost everything I had learned in school and university was,\
  \ here amongst nature, rendered useless, and it seemed almost comical to me that\
  \ I once thought my AutoCAD abilities so important.\n\nWe all learn skills specific\
  \ to the worlds we live in. Specific to survival in our own unique environments.\
  \ Now that I\u2019m home, I long to grow and transplant banana trees the way Chepe\
  \ taught me, but banana trees don\u2019t grow here. And the footpaths are tar-sealed."
