Text: "Maybe the story theme should have been \u2018trying to make a local connection\u2019\
  . Not with a negative connotation of course. Just because the first thing I had\
  \ to accept was that Russian people barely speak English and russian stands at italian\
  \ as soup stands at pizza, just to not forget stereotypes. This was sad: language\
  \ differences are like walls ( thanks English for breaking down them). Meanwhile\
  \ it was already some interesting thing to find out: why a nation so important storically\
  \ and economically is so \u2018isolated\u2019 relatively this stuff? I was pretty\
  \ convinced that the answer was inside the well-known conflict with USA (it\u2019\
  s human tragic instinct!) and I was very surprised when a guy in a jazz pub in Saint\
  \ Petersburg gave me his personal answer. \u2018Russian people don\u2019t like to\
  \ study\u2019 he told me laughing. True or not, it was a point of view of an indigenous\
  \ (really smart plus) and it caught me. This gap wasn\u2019t enough to hide that\
  \ lava chocolate earth of those people, so many times someone  offered me a not\
  \ requested help when I was looking for the right direction in a metro station!\
  \ Even if they couldn\u2019t speak english ( and i was unequivocally a tourist!).\
  \ An hot chocolate heart in the cold.\nIn Moscow is like you can\u2019t find the\
  \ \u2018end\u2019. Everything is bigger and the space is boundless. Palaces are\
  \ bigger, streets are bigger, squares are bigger and you are a ant. In another planet.\
  \ Signs in Cyrillic everywhere give you that feeling of diversity, but that Burger\
  \ king down the street is ready to make you feel at home again. Russia defended\
  \ itself well, but at last it had to surrender. \nWhen I got to the Red Square,\
  \ just few minutes before they closed it (an handsome soldier is ready to put barriers\
  \ at the end of the day), it sounded familiar. \nIt\u2019s like when you see Tour\
  \ Eiffel or Christ Reedemer, they are marked in your mind as symbols. And symbols\
  \ speak the language of emotions and explain things that words can\u2019t even imagine.\
  \ I felt that feeling or courage and revolution, of firmly believeng in ideas. Not\
  \ the right ideas, just ideas. And I enjoyed those feeling standed few minutes more\
  \ in front of St. Basil\u2019s cathedral, \u2018Candy shop\u2019 to friends.\nIn\
  \ Saint Petersburg I coudn\u2019t stop the cd of Anastasia\u2019s soundtrack in\
  \ my mind. When in Palace square a horse-drawn carriage paraded in front of the\
  \ Winter Palace volume was at full tilt. Nevysky Prospekt was abuzz and so was I,\
  \ so many times I tried to imagine it reading Dostoyevsky! Saint petersburg is an\
  \ elegant lady, a young one: it dates back just to 1600! But the Tsars were clearly\
  \ in love with neoclassical style, you blame them? Saint Petersburg is a pride lady.\
  \ \nMaybe it\u2019s because I was born by the sea, or because I was about to live,\
  \ but the most emotional moment of the entire trip was when after crossing the immense\
  \ garden of Peterhof Palace, almost scary in that pitch black at 7:30 p.m., I sneaked\
  \ up in front of the Gulf of Finland and I almost cried.\nAs long as the sea will\
  \ kiss the ground, I will always feel at home."
