Text: "In the midst of a landslide, broken roads and zero means of communication,\
  \ the energy that made us reach to the most enchanted place, \"Narayan Ashram\"\
  , was absolutely unimaginable. \n\nThe holy place far from the city chaos was built\
  \ to provide a put up for pilgrims. Surrounded by a valley of flowers I had never\
  \ seen, for that covered the mountain of Kanchanjanga was truly mesmerising. \n\
  With the ancient carvings over the domes, single bed room to a small museum with\
  \ the collection of the antique that were used during Narayan Swami's stay.\n\n\
  Located far from Pithoragad, dist. Kailash.\nTourist department have taken the utmost\
  \ care by providing the lodging right below the Ashram to avoid the chaos and disturbance.\
  \  \n\nJust a treck above the Ashram is 'Shunya Kutir' (zero presence), which leads\
  \ you to an attic of a hut type dome. Just as much that one can sit providing the\
  \ view to the beautiful mountain of Kanchanjanga through a small window. Nothing\
  \ but I heard my breath tuning with my heartbeats.  I could hear it loud and clear.\
  \ Seating almost for an hour, I went down to give my volunteering services as I\
  \ cleaned the temple area, went to pick the organic vegetables and cooked for 'Bhandara'\
  \ food for free, for almost 30 pilgrims.\n\nInstead of a jeep ride, I preferred\
  \ to walk bare food over the meadows and I insisted on a horse ride to discover\
  \ an untamed jungle of Deodar. Birds chirping, wind was playful over the green lush\
  \ forest. It was unbelievable to discover a place where it gave opportunity to discover\
  \ your ownself. \n\nBy the dusk I was back at my put up at Ashram, preparing for\
  \ an evening ritual of 'Bhajan Sandhya ' chanting of the shlokas that echoed the\
  \ surrounding.  Vibration were so pure, enough to put a wavering mind to peace.\n\
  \nThere are few tourist who visits Ashram every year just to provide education and\
  \ 2 time meal  to the village kids.\nI went there as they celebrated their  annual\
  \ day, which never meant to be the end of their academic year but to celebrate the\
  \ presence that of a teacher. \n\n15 days....wow the time was pacing faster than\
  \ I imagined, my bags were packed and so were my tears as all the localites felt\
  \ hard to face a good bye, promised to visit them soon.\n\n\n\n\nI never felt to\
  \ go back home leaving"
