Text: "I dreamt of hiking the Appalachian Trail, so after spending the 4th of July\
  \ in NYC I booked a one way flight to Charlotte, NC. I rented a mini cargo van as\
  \ the most practical means to navigate remote Appalachia at my whim, while also\
  \ providing a secure and mobile place to sleep amidst the unplanned, unfamiliar,\
  \ and remote travel ahead.\n\nI later made my way to Asheville, NC deciding to rent\
  \ a bike to explore town and Pisgah National Forest. I googled some shops, but the\
  \ rates were high, the availability low. I called some places on Craigslist, leaving\
  \ messages since no one picked up. The odds weren't looking good. I was getting\
  \ fed up with the hunt so I took a break to get some food at one of the local craft\
  \ breweries.\n\nWhile sipping a juicy IPA, I received a hilarious text from someone\
  \ named \"Brewce\" using an unfamiliar number. The relationship escalated quickly\
  \ when he text me a risqu\xE9 photo of a bike he had for rent. I called him and\
  \ set a time to swing by. He promised to meet all my requirements for time, equipment,\
  \ and price...\"no problem.\" It seemed too good to be true.\n\nI drove over to\
  \ his little unit in a storage facility just before the posted closing time. Brewce\
  \ had the bike set up ready to go. Brewce, had steel-blue eyes, effortless shoulder\
  \ length salt and strawberry hair, and like many cyclists, was trim, had perfect\
  \ thrift-store style, sun-kissed skin, and an ageless smile. \n\nFriendship is an\
  \ unexpected thing, part vulnerability, part circumstance, one hundred percent magic.\n\
  \nWhen you connect with a stranger who immediately makes you curiously aware of\
  \ your weaknesses and strengths, your frustrations and your passions, the before\
  \ and after of your life disappear. Whatever you had imagined as possible is changed\
  \ forever.\n\nBrewce's rawness and humility stripped me bare, and wrapped me in\
  \ generosity and humor. What was left was space, infinite space, free of secret\
  \ scripts, and imagined barriers. The byproduct of that vulnerability was intimacy,\
  \ the intimacy that exists in friendship that usually takes years to build. This\
  \ mirror allowed us to appreciate one another as part of the same beautiful, ridiculous\
  \ whole.\n\nI ended up renting the bike and staying in Asheville for longer than\
  \ I had anticipated thanks to Brewce's hilarity, hospitality, and friendship.\n\n\
  One day, Brewce invited me to join him and his girlfriend to go floating on the\
  \ tree-lined French Broad River. Jennie Lou was a voluptuous and radiantly lively\
  \ women with a personality that matched her curves. She was the woman I imagined\
  \ Brewce would be with, a woman the original Hollywood dames would have drank  beer\
  \ with. There we were under a highway bridge drinking beers as we chatted and filled\
  \ up inner-tubes. It begin to rain, but just the perfect amount for a float in the\
  \ hot, humid days of a Blue Ridge summer. The regal, yet flat and muddy French Broad\
  \ was unlike the creeks and dry drainage channels we have in deserts and mountains\
  \ of Southern California where I am from. \n\nWe carried on like old friends as\
  \ we drank beers and enjoyed the cloud-filled sky, cool water, and warm intermittent\
  \ rain. Brewce told stories as we drifted down the river like tied-up Cheerios in\
  \ a bowl of chocolate milk: A woman drove off the bridge landing there four years\
  \ ago. They just removed the car last year. Our place is over there. It's kind of\
  \ a dump, but it's cozy and the landlord doesn't suck. Home prices/rents have skyrocketed\
  \ due to the breweries and artist moving in.\n\nWe landed at a perfectly situated\
  \ river adjacent saloon where we dried off and enjoyed beer and food as banjo music\
  \ played.\n\nOn my last day in Asheville I stopped by Brewce's shop to say goodbye.\
  \ The bike, the money I handed him, formalities. I told him he should charge more.\
  \ I had found so much more than an affordably priced bike on Craigslist. We drank\
  \ a few beers in his shop, and generally just enjoyed each other's company and existence\
  \ as we floated in the river of life that makes up this vast, mysterious world."
