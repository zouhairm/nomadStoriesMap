Text: "I had always wanted to see different countries I always believe that travelling\
  \ one of the most thing if you have a chance to do it then you should do it, my\
  \ journey latterly started when we decided to came to Australia. I started to search\
  \ for education institution , restaurant, places, event, and much more. I was remember\
  \ that I am really excited to see the other word, having a lot of planning. But\
  \ sometimes whatever you prepared or plan to that moment something will be missing\
  \ you will never know until you try as we said the story is not like vision.\n\n\
  Australia, spicily Sydney the first impression was the nature it was charming, you\
  \ can not arrived to this country without visiting Beaches, watching sunset, or\
  \ even when you have that bad day you just want to go to the beach set  have that\
  \ long breath, then you will feel you are like in heaven. And the most popular things\
  \ was the cafe there are a lot more than you need, I remember funny thing it took\
  \ me time to get used to it, when I ordered coffee there are many type of coffee\
  \ which is so popular, like mocha, late, flat white, and cappuccino, and black.\
  \ But the different comparing with my country at the overseas we say about regular\
  \ coffee American coffee wither here in Australia long Black it so funny when you\
  \ use to accept the other people culture.\n\nOne of the amazing at Australia is\
  \ the diversity you can fined hundred fifty nationality, and every nationality have\
  \ there own culture and traditional. When I arrived I have to took some classes\
  \ to improve my English language so in that campus I met a lot of people I was remember\
  \ my friend from China she is so polite and giving person love to help others. This\
  \ was one of the beginnings to learn about other cultures. And for knowledge there\
  \ are many people from China in Australia I think more than four million people,\
  \ depend on that trade is to important between two countries, also I vested a China\
  \ town it was huge at Sydney area, you can fined whatever you want you suddenly\
  \ you started to feel like you are in China. \n\nIn the same place I met a student\
  \ from Vietnam, India, Russian, Brazil, Portages, Spain, Turkey, Japan, all of these\
  \ nationalities I never met before but it was a pleasure to know each one of them,\
  \ and I have a chance to try there food, like Turkish bread it so delicious fluffy,\
  \ you can try it once and I can guarantee you will try it again, also there is a\
  \ type of food in Spain I think they are so popular called Tortilla Espanola, let\
  \ me tell you some about it. It is one of the most famous and easiest Spanish dishes\
  \ in the preparation, which is the omelette and consisting of eggs, potatoes, onions,\
  \ salt and pepper, my friend from Spain he made it, and the beautiful thing is to\
  \ share your culture, knowledge, and your thought to others. I think one of the\
  \ best things happened to me is met people from different countries, that diversity\
  \ change my thoughts, and contribute of changing my attitude too.\n\n Another wonderful\
  \ thing here in Australia there is an annual celebration held in all companies specifically\
  \ in 21/March, it called a harmony week, they celebrate of being one of the most\
  \ successful  multiculturalism countries  I have a chance to engage in one of them.\
  \ We prepared our food from different cultures, we dressed our customs and we made\
  \ a newsletter that we talk about our identity and shared our opinion through Australia\
  \ and our experience too. It was an amazing experience in my life and that made\
  \ me more opining to the future . Added to my personality a lot of positive things,\
  \ it is amazing adventure and  unique."
