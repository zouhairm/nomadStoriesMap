Text: "Imagine this. You were living your dreams -\ntravelling to different countries,\
  \ immersing yourself to new cultures, finally living your life out of the 7 to 4\
  \ or 8 to 5 office life you didn't want. And then it was time for you to go home\
  \ and face your reality. Your family was disappointed on you, your relationship\
  \ with your long time boyfriend was starting to hit rock bottom, you were seeing\
  \ your friends attain their success, buying condos and cars, living the way they\
  \ wanted with careers that you no longer see yourself having. But the worst part\
  \ is, you were broke, you were stuck, and you were lost. You started questioning\
  \ yourself, \"where did I go wrong?\" and \"what can I do to change this?\" And\
  \ then one day you said to yourself, \"I need a break from everything\" so you left\
  \ with the goal of finding yourself again.\n\nIt was that moment of pure sadness\
  \ and loneliness that I decided to go with my friend and see the legendary Apo Whang\
  \ Od, dubbed as the last and oldest \"mambabatok\" of the Kalinga ethnic group and\
  \ was awarded with the Philippines' Dangal ng Haraya award for Intagible Cultural\
  \ Heritage on manwhatok aka tattoo folk artist. \n\nTruth be told, it was the hardest\
  \ and most exhausting trip I ever took my entire life. I had to sit on a bus for\
  \ nearly 10 hours with a few breaks here and there, topload on a mini bus and jeepney,\
  \ ride habal-habal (motorcycle), and hike a steep mountain just to experience a\
  \ little break from everything that was making me forget who I really was in the\
  \ first place. But when I reached the mountain province, there was no denying that\
  \ everything I had to go through just to see this place was worth it. Everywhere\
  \ I look, all I could see was sunlight, trees, rice terraces, and rivers. I inhaled\
  \ the fresh air and I exhaled all the negative emotions I've been keeping inside\
  \ my chest for a long time. The people was so friendly and full of light, happiness,\
  \ and kindness. And in that moment, I wished to be free and be brave to be who I\
  \ really want to be.\n\nNow, the thing is, I went there with the mission of finding\
  \ myself but what I didn't know was when I get out of there, I would be a different\
  \ person with a new and fresh perspectivein life. I got three tattoos while I was\
  \ in Buscalan, Kalinga. One is sun which symbolizes life, the other one is arrowhead\
  \ that symbolizes movement/direction, and of course, the three dots or ellipses\
  \ which is Apo Whang Od's signature that symbolizes continuation/infinity. Why these\
  \ three, you may ask? Simple. It's my very own reminder to myself that whatever\
  \ happens, whatever I decide to choose in life, whatever heartbreaks I might experience,\
  \ I will always move towards the continuity of life. It wasn't the end for me if\
  \ my family is disappointed with the decisions I made, if my longtime boyfriend\
  \ saw the changes in me as negative, and if everyone around me is attaining their\
  \ goals and success in life while I am still figuring out who and what I want to\
  \ be. This is my life and I'm going to continue finding sunshine everytime the storm\
  \ clouds are above my head. This is my life and I will always get up, go up, and\
  \ never stay down."
