Text: "Nasir is ruggedly handsome and aging gracefully. He has a square jaw, dimpled\
  \ cheeks, a shock of shiny black hair despite his middle age, and a robust upper\
  \ body. He wears the khaki apparel common to serious outdoorsmen and nature show\
  \ hosts\u2014his is a short-sleeved shirt that stretches a bit too tightly over\
  \ his slight paunch and shorts that constrict his muscular thighs.\n\u201CWe won\u2019\
  t come back to the lodge today until we see some dolphins. How about that?\u201D\
  \ he beams at me.\nI feel reassured by this. Seeing a pink river dolphin is a box\
  \ on my list, but my two friends and I missed out on an entire day of the 4-night\
  \ \u201C360\u02DA experience\u201D we\u2019d booked in the Ecuadorian Amazon. One\
  \ of them had had a violent reaction to the malaria pills she\u2019d taken and we\u2019\
  d missed our flight out of Quito.\n\u201CThat\u2019s a shame because those pills\
  \ really aren\u2019t necessary,\u201D a Swedish medical student in our tour group\
  \ had said when my friend told him what happened to her.\nLike we\u2019d done the\
  \ day before, the twenty or so of us scramble into a large, motorized skiff tethered\
  \ to the lodge\u2019s wooden pier and set out with Nasir at the helm. The sound\
  \ of the outboard motor thunders through the trees as we navigate the waterways.\
  \ Smoke trails in our wake. Every so often, Nasir stops us somewhere and enthusiastically\
  \ directs our gaze up toward the canopies at some stubbornly elusive bird or monkey.\n\
  We disembark on a densely vegetated bank, and Nasir plucks some fruit from a nearby\
  \ tree. He hands it out for us to share. The meat inside the leathery green pods\
  \ is white, sweet, and sticky. Monkey candy, he calls it. During our trek through\
  \ the jungle, he points out more noteworthy plant life. Cinchona bark, he says,\
  \ has historically been prized for its ability to treat fevers and malaria, and\
  \ it is used by members of the local tribes to this day.\n\u201CDo they not have\
  \ access to medical professionals?\u201D asks the Swedish student.\n* * * * *\n\
  While visiting the Siona people, I volunteer to be cleansed by their shaman. He\u2019\
  s the only villager dressed in traditional attire. I sit at his feet while he chants\
  \ over me. After selfies with the shaman, Nasir splits us up by gender for our next\
  \ activities. I don\u2019t want to chop wood with the men, so I move to join the\
  \ women, who are getting ready to make yuca bread with the village matrons.\n\u201C\
  That\u2019s a woman\u2019s job,\u201D Nasir cautions me. I tell him I don\u2019\
  t mind.\nPeeled yuca root is long, slick, and tapered. It has to be ground down\
  \ and then strained to make the flour for the bread. I grip one tightly\u2014they\u2019\
  re slippery\u2014and begin vigorously triturating it with a grater. It turns out\
  \ I\u2019m quite adept at this, and I am soon out-pacing the girls. Nasir wanders\
  \ over and marvels at my skills.\n\u201CJorge\u2019s ready for marriage!\u201D he\
  \ announces to the group.\n\u201CI\u2019m very domestic and good with my hands,\u201D\
  \ I reply.\nOn our way back, Nasir stops the boat in a wide confluence and turns\
  \ the motor off.\n\u201CLoud noises frighten them!\u201D he says excitedly. Then\
  \ turning to me, \u201CI told you we\u2019d find them!\u201D\nA few dozen feet from\
  \ us, near the treeline, a pink river dolphin and her calf breach the surface. Their\
  \ movements are more subtle than I expected\u2014I can barely tell they\u2019re\
  \ there. Botos, as the dolphins are called, used to be a more common sight in the\
  \ floodwaters of the Ecuadorian Amazon, Nasir explains, but the destruction of their\
  \ habitat has made them harder to find. The rainforest is so massive it might seem\
  \ immutable, eternal, he goes on, but it\u2019s really up to us to safeguard its\
  \ future.\n\u201CBut how can we contribute to conservation efforts?\u201D inquires\
  \ the Swede.\n\u201CYou can tell your friends and everyone you know to come visit,\u201D\
  \ answers Nasir. \u201CTo come here and see what you\u2019ve seen, to experience\
  \ what you\u2019ve experienced.\u201D\nThe sounds of the Amazon are drowned out\
  \ by the roar of our motor starting up again. It\u2019s almost sundown, so we speed\
  \ back to the lodge."
