Text: "Think of a big parade. Everybody in a costume, drinking, dancing and laughing\
  \ and then, imagine me in the middle of it not knowing what to do. \n\" You have\
  \ to make a joke but using a rime,\" Ricardo Told me. Yes, I was part of the parade.\
  \ Yes, I was wearing a costume. Yes, I was a little drunk. \n\nBy the time I arrived\
  \ Latacunga in Ecuador I didn\xB4t know it was the time of the year they are on\
  \ Holidays, so it was a little shock to me seeing all people getting ready to celebrate\
  \ the \"Mama Negra\" Festival. \nA few days later, I had become friends with a local\
  \ guy, I had managed to get a costume and participate first hand. All citizens get\
  \ involved as Latacuga is not a big city, the parade covers almost all along from\
  \ north to south, and the streets are full of people,  both the participants and\
  \ watchers. \nPicture a lot of groups formed by family and friends, all dressed\
  \ up as traditional characters that intend to pay tribute to a local deity. In one\
  \ of those groups, there was my character, they gave me an interactive one. I was\
  \ one of the \"Loeros,\" dressed as a soldier with a painted face and a bucket full\
  \ of local liqueur.  The \"Loero\" has one mission, to make people laugh and make\
  \ them drunk, but it is not so easy as it sounds, the joke has to be said as a rime\
  \ and very out loud. So, there was I, people on the sidewalk yelling at me.....!Loa\xA1\
  \ !Loa\xA1 !Loa\xA1, asking for a drink and a joke.  I was already part of the festival.\
  \ By the end of the day, I had walked all across the city and I remember asking\
  \ my fellow participants what happens after the parade is finished. Surprisingly,\
  \ there is more to tell. \nI accepted an invitation to a traditional dinner, where\
  \ several traditional dishes were served alongside some rare booze made of cane.\
  \ That was the end of one of the craziest days of my life. \n\nIt was not planned\
  \ like this, but Latacunga turned out to be a perfect central base in order to visit\
  \ some of the great places located in the Sierra region of Ecuador.  So, the rest\
  \ of the trip I get to travel to some mountains that are located near the city as\
  \ Cotopaxi Volcano where visitors are allowed to camp and do some climbing. Quilotoa's\
  \ Lagoon is a Volcano with a natural crater full of water, you have to walk down\
  \ the crater almost an hour to get to the lagoon and there you can kayak and if\
  \ there is time do some camping. Here I have to warn you, climbing the crater is\
  \ very physically demanding and it is almost a two hours walk. \n\nFinally, I have\
  \ to say that the food I tried during this trip was crazy and excellent. I have\
  \ not seen this much of culinary variety in other countries. Having said that, the\
  \ city of Latcunga in Ecuador is a must if you are traveling through South America.\
  \ You certainly will find new friends, you will eat some of the craziest dishes,\
  \ and who knows? You can even be part of a traditional Holiday's Parade."
