Text: "When we stopped at Mallow, four people gathered their bundles and descended\
  \ the steps onto the platform.  I was thankful the car was quiet.  Just then a group\
  \ of five 20-something-year-olds rushed into the train, laughing loudly and pushing\
  \ each other for seats.  Two males and three females.  Two of the ladies were wearing\
  \ short skirts with black nylons.  One wore tennis shoes while the other had laced-up\
  \ ankle-high boots.  The third  lass wore cut-off shorts over dark blue nylons and\
  \ low-heeled shoes.  All three had long hair, one blondish, one auburn and one dyed\
  \ bright sky blue.  One guy had long ash-blond hair that looked as though it hadn\u2019\
  t been washed in a while.  He was wearing jeans that were torn at the knees, military-style\
  \ boots, a t-shirt and a sheepskin vest.  He had a gold stud in his right earlobe.\
  \  The passengers could tell the other guy was the leader of the group.  With curly\
  \ black hair that fell down over his green eyes, he was attired in chino pants and\
  \ black leather boots.  His white shirt some embroidery in dark green along the\
  \ sleeve plackets and cuffs.  He had a couple of days\u2019 beard growth.  After\
  \ they scuffled for their seats, the leader produced a bottle of Jameson.  I had\
  \ an uneasy feeling that these might be hooligans.  I began dreading the next leg\
  \ of the journey.  The four followers playfully, but aggressively, tried to grab\
  \ the whisky from the leader as he taunted them.  At that moment I noticed a mother\
  \ holding her two children closer to her side, trying to slide to the edge of car\
  \ seat.  She appeared to be fearful of what these ruffians would do to her and her\
  \ children - or of their influence on her two young boys.  The laborer sat very\
  \ still with his eyes watching the proceedings.  He was perched, tilting a bit forward\
  \ with his open hands resting on his knees.  He was ready to stand up and defend\
  \ himself or anyone else from these raucous delinquents.  I felt relieved he was\
  \ there to protect us.  \u201CCome on, man, let me have some of the good stuff!\u201D\
  \  The blond guy again reached for the bottle.  The leader, replied, \u201CHey,\
  \ man.  You should\u2019ve brought your own.  You can\u2019t bogart mine!\u201D\
  \  Then, I realized they were American.  Their Midwestern accent gave them away.\
  \  I cringed.  I felt embarrassed that they were from the USA.  I had traveled extensively\
  \ in Europe, and too many times I saw the \u2018ugly Americans\u2019 on the streets,\
  \ in cafes, in bars.  These guys seemed oblivious to the etiquette of the respectful\
  \ quietness of the Irish people traveling at this time of night.\nI hoped these\
  \ individuals were only riding to the next stop.  The leader commenced to slap his\
  \ thigh.  At first, he slapped his left leg slowly.  Then he sat up straight and\
  \ started to rhythmically hit both of his thighs with both hands.  Pat, pat, whack,\
  \ pat, pat, whack,...  His companions began clapping.  The guy in jeans was clapping\
  \ the exact same rhythm as Green Eyes.  The ladies clapped a syncopated beat that\
  \ dove-tailed nicely.  Then the leader burst into song.  \u201CI\u2019ll tell me\
  \ Ma when I get home, the boys won\u2019t leave the girls alone.  They\u2019ll pull\
  \ my hair, they stole my comb.  Well, that\u2019s alright till I go home\u2026\u201D\
  \  When the chorus of the song came, all five were gyrating rhythmically and singing\
  \ together.  \u201CShe is handsome.  She is pretty.  She is the belle of Belfast\
  \ City.  She is courtin\u2019 one, two, three.  Please won\u2019t you tell me, who\
  \ is she?\u201D  I didn\u2019t know what to make of it.  They still appeared to\
  \ be drunk, and they were too loud for the already-established relaxed decorum of\
  \ the train car ride.  However, their voices did not suggest they were ridiculing\
  \ the Irish people or the song; they appeared to simply enjoy singing.  I recognized\
  \ the song and knew they weren\u2019t saying things with double meanings that could\
  \ offend my train companions.  \u201CShe\u2019s as nice as apple pie.  She\u2019\
  ll get her own lad by and by.  When she gets a lad of her own, She won\u2019t tell\
  \ her Ma when she gets home.\u201D"
