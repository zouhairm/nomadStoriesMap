  \ smile, like they have never been hurting. They smile and it\u2019s looks so natural.\
  \ If they smile - does it mean that they do it honest?  Or may be it\u2019s true\
  \ that in America is nothing honest - just money and smiling..\n\nWe went hiking\
  \ on the top of the word, the trees so big! Like I am kid and they are huge like\
  \ everything else around! And mountains are huge! Clouds were under my foot, could\
