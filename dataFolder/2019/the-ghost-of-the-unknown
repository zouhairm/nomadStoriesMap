Text: "The mesmerizing lanes of Benaras were making me lose my sense of direction.\
  \ Any navigation system on one\u2019s smart phone goes for a toss when one enters\
  \ this amazing maze. The narrow lanes are just around a couple of meters wide, happily\
  \ crunched, making one feel cozy, sometimes overwhelmed.  One has to make way through\
  \ the cows standing in the middle of the streets, people wanting to go ahead of\
  \ you and bikes honking continuously and the riders giving you an angry look which\
  \ suggests, \u201CThe street belongs to the ones with vehicles. Move away!\u201D\
  \ \n\nAnd then suddenly, I was shooed away by people carrying dead bodies on their\
  \ shoulders on their way to the way to cremation. This city attracts people to die\
  \ as according to Hinduism, it is considered very auspicious to get to die here!\
  \ Suddenly the whole craziness in the lanes transcends one into a different state\
  \ of mind altogether where one starts wondering about death, life and life after\
  \ death\u2026 What is there after the leap into the unknown?\n\nThis is a usual\
  \ part and parcel of life in Benaras. The city affects one in so many ways that\
  \ no wonder it is written about a lot since time unknown. It is a city of temples,\
  \ faith, the sacred river Ganges, the dead and the cows. But the ghats (a flight\
  \ of steps leading down to a river)\u2026\n\nThe ghats in Benaras are magical. \
  \ As it is a city of temples, there are many temples on the waterfront. While roaming\
  \ on the ghats, I spotted a temple which was on a higher altitude. There were steps\
  \ leading up to the temple. As I climbed up and breathed in the beautiful view of\
  \ the river, the ghats and admired the beauty of the intricate work on teak wood\
  \ on the temple, I still wanted to see more. Generally the temples or religious\
  \ places in historical cities have houses of their followers around it, which reflect\
  \ their traditional way of life, the negotiation of spaces for religious activities\
  \ and what not!\n\nI got out the temple complex from the other door which was opposite\
  \ to where I had entered from, hoping to find some houses and people busy living\
  \ a unique life in these unique surroundings. I was excited and already trying to\
  \ imagine what I would see and preparing myself for the best. But to my surprise,\
  \ I stepped into rubble! The houses which I was dreaming about were under demolition.\
  \ The skeletons of the buildings were still there in the rubble, like a half dead\
  \ creature counting a few last breaths waiting for death. The skeletons had all\
  \ kinds of marks of life on it expressing what it witnessed for 100 or 200 years\
  \ or may be for more than that. There were colorful patches of paints indicating\
  \ different rooms; there were beautiful wooden door and window frames now shattered\
  \ and lifeless.\n\nAs I kept walking through it, I spotted a person in the rubble,\
  \ sitting in front of a half-demolished wall where the statues of his deity were\
  \ kept traditionally as it showed the marks of being there for a really long time\
  \ in his family. He was performing religious activities in the sea of the rubble!\
  \ I wondered what he must have been feeling. The demolition drive was supposedly\
  \ to \u201Cbeautify\u201D that part of city by erasing the living history. \nAccording\
  \ to Hindu philosophy, birth and death is cyclical. But the death of a city, a neighborhood,\
  \ a way of life, a culture and tradition is irreversible. The concept of beautification\
  \ of a city in this way is the same as the bike rider\u2019s idea of who the street\
  \ belongs to. The person worshiping in the rubble took me to the same state of mind\
  \ as mentioned before. I could see the mourning in his action. And I peeped into\
  \ the ghost of the \u2018unknown\u2019\u2026 The haunting living history that would\
  \ have once dwelt happily in that space..."
