Text: "I used to read about discovering ages when I was about 13, I remembered that\
  \ I always felt sick about the idea of spending more than a few hours in a trip.\
  \ The ocean was like another galaxy, from where I was not sure I could come back\
  \ home. It was not just a teen\u2019s fantasy at all. Nowadays, I think that I was\
  \ about to understand that the ocean brings a magical mistery, a kind of third dimension\
  \ that takes us to the deepest reality inside us every time we dare to go across\
  \ this.\nOk. Next chapter. Almost 20 years after, I was avoiding organizing a trip\
  \ to Portugal. Lisbon, Porto, Alcoba\xE7a, Braga... it was a great list of great\
  \ places to visit. But the idea of going across that kind of portal, from where\
  \ I was not sure I\u2019d come back home...this was freezing me! Elephants, when\
  \ they stay the whole life under arrest, are afraid of freedom, even if they are\
  \ arrested by a line, a thin line. Backpack, solar protector (it was July, euro\
  \ summer!), bags, passport! All ready for seven hours inside an airplane.\nI remembered\
  \ what I saw, as soon the plane landed on Lisbon: a beautiful, shining and extraordinary\
  \ sun rising in front of me. I finally got to the other side of the ocean, just\
  \ like Cabral did before me, more than 500 years ago.\nI could describe how I saw\
  \ Ipanema streets tattooed around the places the taxi explored; or about lots of\
  \ facade building that remembered me about many other Brazilian capital cities.\
  \ I won\u2019t do that, because my eyes and my whole soul were first absorbed by\
  \ Dom Pedro IV Square, or Rossio Square, my first stop after leaving the bags at\
  \ the hotel.\nI was too hungry, it was about 7 and we could see some cafes opened.\
  \ I forgot how starving I was for a while, just to walk by that beautiful square.\
  \ The weather was nice and that was one of the most beautiful places I had ever\
  \ seend in my life. Some old guys and ladies were passing by; they greeted me, making\
  \ me feel part of that all.\nI sat at a cafe, ordered for a cup of tea, an orange\
  \ juice, or \u201Csumo\u201D as they say and a fruit salad. A few people were jogging,\
  \ some group of families coming and ordering their breakfast, or \u201Cpequeno almo\xE7\
  o\u201D: little lunch is the correct translation for the Portuguese expression.\
  \ It\u2019s not difficult to understand why do they call breakfast like this: in\
  \ Portugal you eat very, very, very well. All kind of food, patisserie, breads and\
  \ many other things is offered with all different prices, places and tastes. Ok,\
  \  I need to say that the best croissant of the world can be eaten in Portugal,\
  \ at a place called Paul!\nAfter having my \u201Clittle lunch\u201D, I took my backpack\
  \ and went for a walk by one of the streets around the square. Rossio square is\
  \ located in downtown of Lisbon and many of the streets that surround it take you\
  \ to a great meeting with Tejo river.\nAt about 8:30, there were many people walking\
  \ on the streets. Portugal is a very touristic country and receives many people\
  \ from all around the world. The sun was showing us its power, but the cold breeze\
  \ I felt in my face, made me take a deep breath, just like I was trying to inhale\
  \ all that place, and make that part of my soul.\nWalking down the street, many\
  \ stories, many people, food, street artists ( lots of them!) all well arranged\
  \ on very charmed sidewalks, covered by that typical mosaic made with rocks, Portuguese\
  \ rocks, as well. \nI was on Augusta Street and I could feel as Dorothy, in the\
  \ yellow brick road. She was looking for the Oz Wizard; I was being taken by the\
  \ spirit of Tejo, the great Tejo. Each of my steps took me to  a place I\xB4d never\
  \ come back from: the meeting with Tejo, was a meeting with the deepest side of\
  \ me."
