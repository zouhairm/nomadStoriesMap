Text: "My back gently sways in my seat as the many fields and onion-domed churches\
  \ of the Isental pass slowly before my eyes. A journey I have made many times before,\
  \ I breathe in and gaze out onto the landscape looking for something new; which\
  \ I always find. The train arrives in M\xFChldorf am Inn and after a brief connection,\
  \ I am only 20 minutes away from Neumarkt- St. Veit. The single-track railway goes\
  \ further into the hinterland. Traveling through tunnels of trees and shrubs, until\
  \ finally the open valley emerges, and the tower of St. Veit can be seeing dominating\
  \ the skyline.  The station building is a very old red brick, and the words \"Neumarkt\
  \ an der Rott\" can be faintly seen inscribed on its walls; a name no longer used.\
  \ I make my way down a pebbled path to the street where I undoubtedly will see at\
  \ least one tractor or no cars at all. I reach the main square which is flanked\
  \ on either end with a short tower, only passable for one car at a time. I stop\
  \ briefly to go inside the Johanneskirche; opening its heavy wooden doors as to\
  \ not make a sound. Walking down the nave, I pause to genuflect and admire the vaulted\
  \ ceiling, brightly colored statues, and golden woodwork. I sigh as a moment of\
  \ memories flood my senses. I leave the church, again being mindful of the heavy\
  \ doors. I continue past the shops, one selling toys, the other bags and umbrellas.\
  \  Schloss Adlstein, which has now been converted into the city hall; on my right\
  \ as I make my way down the pebbled path to the bridge which crosses the Rott. The\
  \ striking, yet humble dome of St. Veit comes into view. Standing high above the\
  \ Rott and fields, the cloister and its importance long forgotten. The sandy path\
  \ continues, becoming a street and then a dirt road with no name. After only a short\
  \ way I reach the bottom of the hill. I look up and see the four-sided traditional\
  \ farm perched midway up in my panorama, the lawn and fields spread out in all directions.\
  \ That feeling of intimacy again; a place I lived only briefly but return to as\
  \ a second home. I head for the entrance road which winds round the back, past the\
  \ little pond and boat house, up to the Kapelle (Chapel) hidden under the cherry\
  \ tree. I cross the field, grass swishing at my ankles; taking a moment to sit on\
  \ the bench under the tree. Time to breathe in again, I marvel at the view. Everything\
  \ stands still, the faint sound of birds chirping, the train horn in the distance,\
  \ perhaps the calling out of a cow or two. Before me is St. Veit, and Neumarkt down\
  \ below. The farm house to my right and open fields to my left, the chapel only\
  \ a few feet behind me. The idyllic stereotype of what it means to be in Bavaria.\
  \ I turn and go into the chapel, my neck bent down as I light the candle and find\
  \ the most recent guest book.  Memories. I open the guest book to see the inscriptions\
  \ of many visitors, myself included. I am not the only one to take in this small\
  \ trek, nor the last. I grab the pen, balancing the book as I write the date and\
  \ begin my inscription. The words flow onto the page, I sign my name below.  I turn\
  \ one last time towards St. Veit and snap a few quick photos before I head back\
  \ down the hill.  Neumarkt disappears behind the treeline and back buildings as\
  \ I walk into the courtyard, already seeing the glistening eyes, my arms automatically\
  \ outstretched to receive the embrace of those you call family."
