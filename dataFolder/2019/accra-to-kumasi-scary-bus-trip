Text: "I took a large van from the dusty red dirty bus depot on the bumpy side of\
  \ the aging town of Accra. Richard, my newfound friend and employee at La Palm Royal\
  \ Beach Hotel, offered to drive me, but, as was understandable, his car broke down\
  \ on the way to pick me up.  So, as a solo traveler, and having to risk trust, I\
  \ climbed into the van's back seat where the only two seats available were located.\
  \  The people already seated were working class business folk wanting to get to\
  \ their destination in the most jiffy time. The bus meandered from the lot and found\
  \ it's way to the one lane road for the three hour journey.  As riders dozed while\
  \ others talked quietly or read, I tried to acclimate.  \n\"The bus is going too\
  \ fast\", I shouted quietly to Richard.\n\"What are you talking about?\" he responded,\
  \ as if not witnessing the speed.  We were now traveling upwards of 100 miles per\
  \ hour.\n\"This is widely reported in the U.S. as reckless driving and the van could\
  \ flip over\", I informed him.\n\"If you tell the driver to slow down, everyone\
  \ will be mad at you,\" he warned me friendly. \nI began to strategize. Surely this\
  \ was illegal.\n\"What's the speed limit?\" I inquired, to prove a point.\n\"We\
  \ don't have a speed limit,\" he said, unphased by my fear.\nAnd so, I decided I\
  \ would pray.  My answer was that I would give the driver 1.5 hour and I would then\
  \ say I had to use the restroom.\nAfter my heart landed back in its cavity, and\
  \ like Cinderella,  at the appointed time, my independent I-am-woman hand fiercely\
  \ raised, and I loudly and succinctly announced a need for a bathroom.  The driver\
  \ practically slammed the brakes, stopped, and opened the door.\n\"Yes, miss, you\
  \ may go.\"\nI looked around.  The area was more populated than most we had seen\
  \ along the curvy dangerous road.  I had seen women with large platters of deep-fried\
  \ fish and long flowing skirts of colorful African fabric, just squat.  There were\
  \ trenches along the sidewalk in Accra.  I had visited the slave castles already\
  \ in Cape Coast.  I had seen the disgusting living/holding quarters for women and\
  \ men.  I saw trenches or dugouts for waste matter.  Atrocious.  So when this driver\
  \ slammed the brakes and I was to exit, the world was suddenly a lonesome place.\
  \  I rose to exit.  Surely I was taking advantage of keeping my heart intact.  And\
  \ just like Moses crossing the Red Sea, the folk on the bus all got off.  We walked\
  \ back to therest stop, a City block and-a-half back.  I gained confidence, did\
  \ my thing,  and got back to the bus with Phillip.  We made it to Kumasi and I was\
  \ enthralled at the Kente factory.  My purpose for coming was to purchase a Kumasi\
  \ doll.  Phillip took me to the woodcarver.  He said he could make the doll.  \n\
  We then went to the police station.  Just being true to my position, out came my\
  \ camera to take pictures.   Ah, the lady in the tower, perfect shot.\n\"Miss, do\
  \ you want to be arrested?\" she shouted, scaring me.\nPhillip came to the rescue.\
  \  \"This is police area and you cannot take pictures.\"\n\"I'm so sorry,\" I responded\
  \ to the lady. \nAt that moment, Phillip's friend, a brown-skin handsome slim officer,\
  \ approached us.  \"We will take her to the spot!\" he said, beaming with excitement.\
  \ \n\"Yes,\" Phillip agreed.  \"Let's go to the spot.\"\nWe piled unto the tiny\
  \ four seater and drove out of town and along the highway with slopes and valleys.\
  \  After twenty minutes, we started to make our descent.  There was a lake,  a village,\
  \  and a large building with an equally large porch.  It was pouring rain.  A major\
  \ onslaught.\nAs we approached the porch for shelter,  I realized I was a minority.\
  \ Stepping up to join everyone, they were all men.  They were super happy to see\
  \ an American girl.\nWithout shame,  the grown men came over.  Poised and polite,\
  \ one asked if I had any American coins.  I did.  They were happy.  The end"
