Text: "Peeling back the cascading tangle of leaves to squeeze through the slight gap\
  \ in fence, we were greeted by the leering grin of the Laughing Buddha. A sign of\
  \ contentment and abundance, he stands incongruously guarding a dilapidated amusement\
  \ park in Yangon, Myanmar. \n\nWe had arrived in Yangon two days earlier with little\
  \ knowledge of the city \u2013 our only guide was a tattered notebook found in our\
  \ hostel lobby, filled to the brim with scribbled tips and tricks from previous\
  \ travellers. Urban exploring was not something I had done before, and I certainly\
  \ did not expect to find such a gem in the centre of a Burmese metropolis. \n\n\
  It would have been easy for us to miss the hidden entrance were it not for the gestures\
  \ of the knowing locals, waving us through to Yangon\u2019s secret garden. \n\n\
  From the buddha\u2019s clearing the path wound off in multiple directions to reveal\
  \ the remains of the park\u2019s rides, reclaimed by the jungle. Mosquitoes and\
  \ flies hovered around, and a wall of nettles barred the way, yet nothing could\
  \ hold me back from my adventure. The thrill of being somewhere I wasn\u2019t supposed\
  \ to be was overpowering. \n\nTo the left, we discovered an arcade, filled with\
  \ broken games leaning together for support, their names rusted away to oblivion.\
  \ Nearby, a washing line hung from the towering red tracks of one roller-coaster\
  \ to the cart of another, a sign of the former employees who now inhabit the deserted\
  \ shops and restaurants. We split up to explore further. \n\nFollowing the lead\
  \ of the winding roller-coaster track I reached a carousel, its once magnificent\
  \ white steeds flaking away to a dull brown. What had stood the test of time, however,\
  \ were the gold accents, which brought to mind images of it in its former glory.\
  \ Amazingly, when I climbed aboard a horse, the platform shook, and I realised that\
  \ the carousel could still spin. The child in me was delighted. \n\nClose by lay\
  \ the dodgems in their ring \u2013 some had been tossed to the side, stacked up\
  \ like unwanted books on a shelf; others were left where they were last driven,\
  \ filled with dust and brown mulch. From behind this arena came a bark and I swiftly\
  \ turned to follow a different path. We had been warned that the park had become\
  \ home to a pack of wild dogs, so I was keen to avoid them if possible.\n \nBack\
  \ the other way, I reunited with my sister to explore a hot air balloon ride whose\
  \ gate was so rusted, we had to hop over the fence to gain access. The legible parts\
  \ of the rusted ride name stated \u201Cdream\u201D and \u201Cfly\u201D, where employees\
  \ and excited visitors must once have done so. \n\nPast a crooked concession stand\
  \ whose Burmese placard gave little indication of the treats it once sold, I climbed\
  \ aboard the swinging cart of another ride, and truly had my wonderland moment.\
  \ Looking up to the sky, the foliage intertwined with the infrastructure of the\
  \ ride leaving a little sunlight peaking through. It would not be long before this\
  \ ride was completely consumed, but for that moment, my cart swung back and forth\
  \ gently in the breeze. \n\nThe mood was broken with a bark. \n\nWe peered further\
  \ down the path to a sea of gleaming eyes appearing one by one from under the base\
  \ of a ride. We had ventured too far into the territory of the wild dogs, and we\
  \ were no longer welcome. \n\nThe park stood as an oasis in the middle of a bustling\
  \ city, where, for once, nature triumphed over mankind. \u201CHappy World\u201D\
  , as it was known, was a ghost of its former self, and its long-forgotten wonders\
  \ would soon disappear further into obscurity \u2013 its only saving grace, the\
  \ curiosity of intrepid explorers and the dependency of those employees that never\
  \ left. \n\nAs we clambered through the gap to return to the cacophony of the street,\
  \ I realised that without its bitter descent into the wilderness, the beauty of\
  \ the park would be lost in a flurry of candyfloss and children\u2019s laughter.\
  \ Instead, my adventure simply became one of the many secrets those ten acres hold."
