Text: "Techno music bounces around the bones of the Thai monastery like an angry teen.\
  \ Lying there on my rock hard bunk bed in a basic, concrete dorm I am cruelly reminded\
  \ that in Koh Pha-Ngan the party never stops. The aggressive beats disturb any moments\
  \ of sleep right up until my 4 am wake up call. It's time to meditate.\n\nI ask\
  \ myself why I came on Vipassana? To find peace, to find stillness? Yes, but also\
  \ to find an authentic experience on this otherwise tourist dominated island. This\
  \ is an island where the local people smile at but do not mix with, their invaders.\
  \ I don\u2019t blame them. Neon beach warriors, Chang beer in hand, crawl all over\
  \ the place searching for the next party. Castaway-chic new agers congregate nightly\
  \ at the drum circle on Zen Beach. Yoga bunnies pranayama their way through Hatha\
  \ Flow classes that cost the same as a good deal back in London. It\u2019s high\
  \ season and the island feels more like a theme park, the locals its staff.\n\n\
  So there I sit in Wat Khao Tam\u2019s meditation hall, dawn yet to break and techno\
  \ still blaring. I turn to my teacher, a very old, dying Buddhist monk. Discharged\
  \ hours before from hospital for severe dehydration, I wonder if he has the physical\
  \ strength to deliver his teachings. But he tries. In broken English, he speaks\
  \ to us, a healthy sea of travelers flung as far apart as Tokyo, Moscow, and Colorado.\
  \ Gentle, unconditional love seeps out of him like a warm apricot mist. I want to\
  \ listen to him with all of my heart, to somehow absorb the ancient knowledge that\
  \ he has worked so hard to obtain.\n\nBut after four days, it is too much. The Vipassana\
  \ is lost in translation. I return back to the island. Back to my place as a tourist.\
  \ Back to being a simple punter. Bitterly I reflect on being English, hailing from\
  \ a country built by forcing itself and it\u2019s language onto others. A twist\
  \ of guilt punctures my frustration in not being able to understand the monk. I\
  \ resolve to accept that perhaps in some places tourists and locals do not mix.\
  \ Perhaps it is the local\u2019s one last remaining defence.\n\nWith new acceptance,\
  \ it\u2019s time to keep moving and try an unknown place for dinner. Chaloklum beach\
  \ has tourist families aplenty but somehow the banana-shaped fishing boats give\
  \ it an anchor in something like authenticity. The Pad See Eww is delicious and\
  \ the night is warm. However, it is the second right turn on the way back home that\
  \ brings the magic.\n\nAt the start of the pier is a tiny, bustling Sunday night\
  \ market complete with a local, Thai reggae band playing songs about paradise. Satay\
  \ chicken, BBQ fish, and doughnut stalls modestly line the perimeters. Thai and\
  \ western families eat, drink and relax.  In a glorious moment, the division is\
  \ lifted and authenticity permeates. With relief, I see that Koh Pha-Ngan does still\
  \ have something left untouched by the madding crowd, still real, still raw and\
  \ still humble. As I drink it in, I privately hope that it remains so."
