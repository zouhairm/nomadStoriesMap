Text: "A scenic sunset spin through the winding hills of Kigali should have been my\
  \ preamble to how Rwanda would steal my heart. The three of us sharing a cab don\u2019\
  t speak much on the drive from the airport to the Marriott. Rather, we take in the\
  \ views. Our driver pointing out landmarks, us occasionally interrupting him with\
  \ 'oohs' and 'aahs'. Already, we\u2019re mesmerised. I'm only supposed to be here\
  \ for a 2-day business trip. A networking event for female entrepreneurs, then back\
  \ to Nairobi to the harsh realities of life. However, on a whim, I immediately extend\
  \ my trip and book a cute little apartment for some downtime after the conference.\
  \ Little did I know, what was intended to be a quiet, solo vacation was about to\
  \ morph into an experience I'd never forget. \n\nAfter days spent learning, sharing\
  \ and networking I am feeling challenged, inspired, and motivated. The last thing\
  \ I want to do is spend time alone catching up on my kindle book list. Instead,\
  \ I walk away from the Kigali Marriott ready to accept any challenge that comes\
  \ my way. And as if to prove this to myself, I leap all the way out of my comfort\
  \ zone and cancel my booking. Flanked by my new bestie, Eva, and armed with nothing\
  \ but a Google search history and our carry on suitcases, we jump into a cab and\
  \ make our way to the Nyabugogo Taxi Park to find a bus to Kibuye\u200A\u2014\u200A\
  an idyllic little town located on the shores of Lake Kivu near the border of Congo\
  \ and Rwanda.  Three hours or so later, we arrive. While attempting to navigate\
  \ a tough language barrier at the Kibuye bus station, a bus operator named Damacine\
  \ comes to our rescue. He first ensures that we book our return trip to Kigali after\
  \ which he introduces us to a lovely young boy who offers to escort us to our hotel\
  \ which is a short, albeit steeply uphill, stroll away. \n\nThe lake is remarkably\
  \ beautiful from up here, a stark contrast to the cemetery that lines the hillside.\
  \ The Church St Jean that sits on this very hill is the infamous site (now Memorial)\
  \ of one of the largest massacres of the 1994 Rwandan genocide with over 11,000\
  \ killed in one day. One can\u2019t help but notice the anonymous mass graves along\
  \ the road and the skulls that frame the church windows. It is beyond surreal. \n\
  \nBefore I can even begin to deeper contemplate my emotions, we arrive at our hotel.\
  \ A friendly manager welcomes us at the gate, taking our luggage and leading us\
  \ to the front desk. After a rather quick check-in process and a quick tour of the\
  \ premises, we grab some dinner on the porch and soak in the sunset views. At the\
  \ behest of our hotel manager, we book an early morning boat ride with a tour guide\
  \ named Olivier. The manager insists that we cannot experience Lake Kivu unless\
  \ we chart her waters and I think we agree just to get him to leave us alone. And\
  \ so, before dawn, still groggy cause we chatted away late into the night, Eva &\
  \ I make a long descent downhill to the lake to find Olivier eagerly awaiting us.\
  \  \n\nLike a throwback to the cab ride from the airport, the first few minutes\
  \ are spent in silence allowing me to reflect on the events of the past few days.\
  \ Somehow it feels serendipitous. As if this was some divine chosen sequence of\
  \ events. \n\nAs the cool morning air gently caresses my face I am overwhelmed by\
  \ strange waves of emotions. It is at this moment I realise what it is about Rwanda\
  \ that I love. It\u2019s the fact that despite everything she has been through,\
  \ she has risen like a phoenix from the ashes. It\u2019s that even though she still\
  \ carries scars, she knows that healing is a process. It\u2019s her desire to defy\
  \ all odds and use the very things she was denied; a unified identity and culture\
  \ to heal those wounds. And finally, it\u2019s the fact that she does not try to\
  \ hide her past, but she doesn\u2019t dwell on it either. Still, she rises."
