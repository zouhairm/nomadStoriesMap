Text: "I knew from the time I first started traveling that I didn\u2019t want my trips\
  \ to only be about visiting the fun, happy places. There were good and bad sides\
  \ of every country, and I didn\u2019t want to just filter out the bad parts. That\
  \ was why, on my first day in Cape Town, I hopped on the ferry to Robben Island.\
  \ I already knew some about apartheid in South Africa, but I was not prepared for\
  \ what I saw in that former prison. More than anything, I wasn\u2019t prepared for\
  \ Jama, my tour guide. \n\tHe was a middle-aged man with that thick South African\
  \ accent that a lot of Americans don\u2019t like but I adored. The first thing I\
  \ noticed was that he had a strong resemblance to Mandela himself, but what nearly\
  \ stunned me speechless about Jama was when he told us that, after participating\
  \ in an apartheid protest in his twenties, he had been a prisoner at Robben Island\
  \ for a decade. I told him that if I was him I would\u2019ve wanted to get as far\
  \ away from this place as possible after that, but he replied that he felt an obligation\
  \ to tell people first hand about this brutal part of his country\u2019s history.\n\
  \tEvery tour stop was shocking, like the dusty limestone quarry where the prisoners\
  \ had to work (Jama explained that a lot of the prisoners ended up with eye and\
  \ breathing problems working in the quarry due to the dust) and the barren, meager\
  \ graveyard where prisoners were buried. What nearly brought me to tears, though,\
  \ was the building that served as the prison itself. \n\tJama led us around the\
  \ maximum-security prison turned museum, explaining as we went. He went into great\
  \ detail with each area, but did so in a way that never lost my interest. The fact\
  \ that he\u2019d been a prisoner there meant he could give us facts and details\
  \ that others couldn\u2019t, like the fact that the prisoners had to shower with\
  \ seawater, or describing the pitiful-sounding food that they were given. I\u2019\
  d already known some about the dark history of South Africa and apartheid, but walking\
  \ around Robben Island and seeing it for myself made it real in a way that books\
  \ and documentaries just couldn\u2019t achieve. The entire building seemed to just\
  \ ache, as if all the suffering that had gone on inside had left an emotional weight,\
  \ even though it hadn\u2019t served as a prison in decades. \n\tThe tour ended at\
  \ the cell where Nelson Mandela had spent eighteen years of his life. Looking at\
  \ the tiny cell, the thin straw mat that he slept on, and the metal plate that he\
  \ ate so many unappetizing meals off of made me understand why Mandela was so celebrated\
  \ in this country. I couldn\u2019t understand how someone could spend nearly two\
  \ decades living there without going totally insane. Just looking at the cell made\
  \ me feel claustrophobic, and I wasn\u2019t even inside. \n\tAfter the tour, I quickly\
  \ came up and asked for a picture with Jama. I wanted to remember the man who had\
  \ made my day so special. He seemed taken aback when I asked, but happily posed\
  \ with me for a few pictures. Then he looked at me and said something absolutely\
  \ heart wrenching. His voice broke slightly as he said, \u201CPeople almost never\
  \ ask for that.\u201D Tears stung my eyes as I gave him a hug and thanked him for\
  \ the tour. As I rode the ferry back to Cape Town, I told myself that I\u2019d never\
  \ stop visiting places like Robben Island, and I\u2019d never stop appreciating\
  \ people like Jama."
