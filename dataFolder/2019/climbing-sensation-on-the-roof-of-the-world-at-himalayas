Text: "The stunning Himalayan mountain range has always been a magnet for adventurers\
  \ in various parts of the world. One of them is Annapurna Base Camp which offers\
  \ the sensation of climbing the Himalayas to an altitude of 4,130 masl. Climbing\
  \ to Himalayas is one of my dream destinations since 9 years ago. ABC is the starting\
  \ point for reaching the summit of Mount Annapurna which rises at an altitude of\
  \ 8091 masl.Beside the view is so beautiful, ABC is also popular with friendly hiking\
  \ trails. The difficulty level is moderate, not as heavy as the tracks on the long\
  \ Annapurna Circuit.\n\nHowever, don\u2019t underestimate this climbing path. Mature\
  \ physical preparation must be done before climbing anywhere. I choose to climb\
  \ in October because October is one of the best seasons of climbing. Armed with\
  \ an ABC map and various information that I got from friends who first completed\
  \ trekking, the route on ABC was quite clear so that without any guide climbing\
  \ could be done safely. From Motkyu, my climb began. The first point that I went\
  \ from Motkyu was Chomrong which is at an altitude of 2210 masl.The village is located\
  \ on a hill that has a charming view. The Annapurna mountain which is covered in\
  \ ice can be seen clearly from one of the favorite villages of these climbers. \n\
  \nI need about 3 hours to climb from Motkyu to Chomrong. Before reaching Chomrong\
  \ the village that was passed was Jhinu which was located at an altitude of 1760\
  \ masl. At Chomrong, there are 15 inns available and I stay at a guest house with\
  \ price of 200 per night. The next day on October 6, at 8 am I continued the journey\
  \ from Chomrong to Dovan and stopped before it got dark.\n\nFrom Chomrong, the hiking\
  \ trail crosses Sinuwa village (2340mdpl), Bamboo (2400 masl) until it finally reaches\
  \ Dovan at an altitude of 2600 masl. From Chomrong to Dovan I trekking for almost\
  \ 8 hours. Climbing 7-8 hours a day is a reasonable target for me with a very short\
  \ itinenary. Only 5 days. In Dovan there are only 3 lodgings so there are not many\
  \ choices. I get a lodge with a price of NPR 200 for 1 bed.\n\nOn October 7 at 7:30\
  \ a.m. I continued my journey back from Dovan to Macapuchre Base Camp.To go to MBC,\
  \ the area that must be passed is the Himalayas (2920 masl) and Deurali (3230 masl).\
  \ After lunch break at the Himalaya post, on the way to Deurali, I met 3 Nepali\
  \ climbers and we walked together until MBC. MBC which is 3700 meters above sea\
  \ level is the last village to stay before reaching ABC.\n\nThe four of us stayed\
  \ at one of the lodges on MBC. Climbers are advised to spend the night at MBC before\
  \ continuing the climb to ABC with the aim of acclimatization. If you don\u2019\
  t do acclimatization before, climbers will be vulnerable to altitude sickness or\
  \ Acute Mountain Sickness (AMS). So, to reduce the effects of this altitude sickness,\
  \ acclimatization is mandatory. Especially for climbers who live or are accustomed\
  \ to being in the tropics.\n\nOn October 8, I along with 3 friends from Nepal woke\
  \ up at 3am and made preparations to head to ABC from Macapuchre Base Camp at 4am.\
  \ We walked together to reach ABC at an altitude of 4130 masl. It took 3 hours to\
  \ reach ABC which was the culmination of this climb. Along the MBC hiking trail\
  \ to ABC, on the right and left side of the track is covered with beautiful snow.\
  \ The height of ABC is slightly below the Cartenz Pyramid, Papua, Indonesia but\
  \ higher than the peak of Mount Rinjani in West Nusa Tenggara and Mount Semeru,\
  \ the highest point on the island of Java.\n\nAll the fatigue paid off when I finally\
  \ reached the ABC with difficulty. On the ABC view point there are many colorful\
  \ prayer flags or sacred prayer flags. The climbers took many photos at the spot\
  \ as markers reached the Annapurna Base Camp point. With a variety of limitations,\
  \ dreams to reach ABC are finally achieved and provide many valuable life experiences\
  \ and lessons."
