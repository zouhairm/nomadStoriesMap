Text: "I didn't expect to find my brother on a beach in Greece. Oh, I've met my brother\
  \ \u2013 we grew up in the same house with six other siblings, all homeschooled.\
  \ I spent many hours with my brother, often under protest. But I never found him\
  \ until the night we shared a bottle of  rum on a beach in Mykonos.\n\nI was living\
  \ in Scotland when my brother told me he would be visiting Europe and that we should\
  \ take a trip somewhere cool. Being in grad school I was completely broke, but due\
  \ to E.U. economic policy and favorably priced Easyjet flights, it looked like I\
  \ could barely afford to go to Greece.\n\nWe've shared many things, my brother and\
  \ I, everything that comes with the territory of siblinghood \u2013 clothing, food,\
  \ parents, personal space \u2013 but I had never realized how much we shared as\
  \ people before this trip. Like an inability to get out of bed and leave the hostel\
  \ before 11am, no matter how much we had planned. A fascination with the rules of\
  \ former empires and the foundations of our civilization.. An ease in talking to\
  \ strangers that drew travel companions. The belief that sitting on a sunny beach\
  \ with nothing to do was the height of luxury. And a willingness to try anything\
  \ once.\n\nThe last day of our trip, on Mykonos, sunburnt and down to our last Euros,\
  \ we rented an ATV and drove around the island taking photos of ourselves on tiny\
  \ rock ledges, poised to jump over a turquoise sea. Believing that maps detracted\
  \ from the overall experience, we mistakenly chose a nudist beach as our morning\
  \ swim stop. I couldn't afford any of the island restaurants so we bought a giant\
  \ wheel of sesame bread and a vat of tzatziki to last us through the day. That evening,\
  \ after dropping off the ATV, Graham insisted that we stop at the grocery store\
  \ for a bottle of rum, claiming it was his lifelong goal to drink rum on a beach.\
  \ \n\nOn the beach, we climbed a wedge of twisted black rock that ran down to the\
  \ water and sat in a crevice watching small waves crash below us, drinking rum from\
  \ the bottle. And my brother started talking. Thoughts and stories that I had never\
  \ heard from him before started coming out. He talked about the stress of the constant\
  \ moves during our childhood, about unresolved issues with our parents, particularly\
  \ an angry and usually absent father, about the loneliness of becoming an adult\
  \ and the difficulty of connecting with other people after leaving the forced closeness\
  \ of our family unit. The sun was setting red when we arrived at the beach and it\
  \ quickly went dark as he continued to share thoughts that I had believed I was\
  \ alone in having. Then suddenly he stopped and announced it was time to go in the\
  \ water, climbing down the rock and rolling up his pants before wading out into\
  \ the Aegean Sea, singing repeatedly \u201CYo ho ho and bottle of rum!\u201D\n\n\
  Walking back to the hotel, guiding him around the fissures and potholes in the road's\
  \ surface, and with multiple reassurances that I did in fact remember the way back,\
  \ I realized that I had met someone I never knew that night. You meet many people\
  \ when traveling. Paths cross, continue for a short way together and then diverge\
  \ again into the distance. The small moments of connection with another human are\
  \ those that I treasure the most from my many trips. But I never thought that moving\
  \ thousands of miles across an ocean to escape a family that felt suffocatingly\
  \ present my entire life would bring me closer to them.\n\nTraveling, the escape\
  \ from the familiar, the changing backdrop of different cultures and countries,\
  \ will inevitably bring us face to face with ourselves. With our roots, our beliefs,\
  \ our definition of ourselves outside of the culture and circumstances in which\
  \ we happened to be born. Travel will always, in a sense, bring you home, but I\
  \ never expected one of my best connections to be with family. I didn't expect to\
  \ find my brother on a beach in Greece."
