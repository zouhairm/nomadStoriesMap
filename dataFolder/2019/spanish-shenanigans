Text: "November 2018\u2013I remember the last time I looked at my social media before\
  \ turning my phone on airplane mode.\nI wouldn\u2019t be able to contact anyone\
  \ for approximately nine hours. I had wondered if my dad questioned where I was.\
  \ I hadn\u2019t told him I was flying across the world by myself, leaving the only\
  \ country I\u2019ve ever known. I\u2019m not dumb enough not to tell anyone at all,\
  \ in fact, my whole family knew, just not my dad. I just didn\u2019t want to hear\
  \ the \u201Cyou\u2019re too irresponsible\u201D and \u201Cyou make dumb decisions\u201D\
  \ from him, because this is what I really wanted. I realized this reckless decision\
  \ was worth it when I finally made it to the top of Bunker del Carmel. It was inching\
  \ closer to 9 pm, and I was sipping cheap wine as I stared at the bright lights\
  \ of the city. I was tired as hell after walking what seemed like hours to make\
  \ it to the top, but the crisp, November air and the warm bread and cheese I had\
  \ bought from a market before the journey resting in my lap made it easy to relax.\
  \ Part of me wanted to scold the other part. I liked being here because I like the\
  \ unfamiliar language and cultures and fashion. I adored being surrounded by something\
  \ I have not grown to understand. The chaos of breaking routine and traditions seemed\
  \ to be my poisonous fruit. Being forced to always be aware made something boil\
  \ inside my stomach and everything was surreal. Earlier that day, I had almost gotten\
  \ pickpocketed. My friend had noticed it and slapped his hand away,\u201DNo!\u201D\
  \ It was all she said because that was the appropriate word they our two languages\
  \ had shared. Tasting foreign words is such a sweet yet savory taste. I pried my\
  \ eyes open to add onto my mental list of new experiences I had encountered. I\u2019\
  d do anything for this life."
