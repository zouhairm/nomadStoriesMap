Text: "I've recently revisited the city of Guangzhou \nin the Guangdong province of\
  \ Southern China, where my grandmother currently resides. Having taken regular trips\
  \ every two or three years since I was born to visit her, I thought I was already\
  \ quite well informed about the main attractions of the city.\n\nHowever, on the\
  \ very last day of my recent visit, it was clear that my assumption was wrong. The\
  \ third largest river in China, Zhujiang (or Pearl River), is composed of four river\
  \ systems which converge in the Guangzhou city. Iconic views and skyscrapers adorn\
  \ both sides of the river, perfect for an evening river cruise tour, especially\
  \ when the coloured lights on the buildings and bridges shine on into the night.\
  \ \n\nIn comparison, you would think that the river tour at day time would not be\
  \ as popular as the evening river cruise tour. As I was walking along the port of\
  \ Fangcun that afternoon, I felt a sudden adventurous impulse to take the ferry,\
  \ with the intent to only cross the river to the opposite side. To my surprise,\
  \ I was able to use my transport card (like an Oyster card in London) to pay for\
  \ the fare, which cost 2 yuan (approximately 20 pence)! After around 10 minutes\
  \ of waiting in a lounge of plastic chairs and wondering in disbelief on why it\
  \ was so cheap, I got on the ferry. \n\nI did not follow the other passengers into\
  \ the seated area, and instead, stood outside by the fence to look out into the\
  \ water as the ferry headed on. I was soon marvelling at the view I saw despite\
  \ the cloudy weather. Huge metropolitan office buildings, 5-star hotels and industrial\
  \ factories appeared one by one, passing through traditional Chinese architecture\
  \ and a contrastingly European quarter. Making the most of my 2 yuan and having\
  \ no plans for the next few hours, I stayed on the boat for an hour and a half until\
  \ it reached the last port, stopping right beside the infamous Guangzhou Tower in\
  \ Zhuhai District. It was a great place to end the tour, as everyone got off the\
  \ ferry to take their photos. \n\nAll in all, spontaneous decisions made when traveling\
  \ often lead to things you don't expect to find; and on this occasion, I found an\
  \ inexpensive ferry tour in a familiar city that I will definitely bring friends\
  \ to the next time I visit."
