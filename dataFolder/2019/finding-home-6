Text: "As an immigrant from a country plunged into poverty like Venezuela, I had to\
  \ learn to find my home in the places that surround me, without thinking about the\
  \ possibility of returning to my original place. I found \u201CHome\u201D in Buenos\
  \ Aires, the capital of Argentina, where I\u2019ve been living for two years. However,\
  \ it was only a few months ago that I lived an experience that made me reconnect\
  \ with my home in the least expected place, in one of the humblest and simplest\
  \ places I have ever been.\n\nAt the beginning of this year, I visited Victoria,\
  \ a small town in the province of Entre R\xEDos, where my boyfriend used to live\
  \ before moving to the big city. There is something wonderful about going to places\
  \ you did not know existed before, or you wouldn\u2019t imagine being there even\
  \ in your most elaborate dreams.\n\nUnlike metropolises, there are never many expectations\
  \ when you visit a small town. Unless it\u2019s a place where history stopped to\
  \ be the cradle of some significant human being or event, visiting a town is usually\
  \ not exciting.\n\nBut this is not my case. As an immigrant, I appreciate any intimate\
  \ experience I can make with this culture. Every time I\u2019m in contact with something\
  \ local, I go into a contemplative and pleasant state. That\u2019s why I\u2019m\
  \ grateful to be in a relationship with an Argentinian, because it allows me to\
  \ get to know the cities and its hidden gems, from the knowledge of a villager and\
  \ not from the tourist restlessness of someone who just arrived.\n\nAt first, Victoria\
  \ looks like any other small town. I believe its common notion that \"all small\
  \ towns look the same\", at least in some places in Latin America. Little had I\
  \ traveled, I started to remember Cagua, a town of inclement and incessant heat\
  \ in Aragua, Venezuela, where I spent a part of my childhood. There, in Cagua, lives\
  \ my grandmother and part of my family. Here, in Victoria, lives the grandmother\
  \ and part of my boyfriend's family. Both places are distant from each other, but\
  \ the resemblance of its images and the feelings they evoke are uncanny. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s knowing the doors at your Grandma\u2019s house are always wide open. It\u2019\
  s that big, trembling hug, but with a firm grip that squeezes you hard because she\u2019\
  s happy to have someone visiting her. It\u2019s sitting in the porch, in the living\
  \ room or the balcony and talking about the people from the town, the family that\u2019\
  s absent or asking how things are going in the big city. In Cagua you always drink\
  \ beer. Here the \"mate\" is the one who orchestrates each meeting. Either way,\
  \ you get to sit down, talk, and be part of the simplicity that small towns always\
  \ offer you.\n\nVisiting Victoria and walking through their humble paths, with its\
  \ narrow streets that go up and down thanks to the hills that support the city,\
  \ it\u2019s something that I value because it made me reconnect with my own memories,\
  \ but also gave me first time experiences.\nIt was the first time I ever rode a\
  \ motorcycle, the first time I went to an Argentinian wedding, the first time I\
  \ danced \"cumbia\" until my legs gave up, the first time I met an Argentinian family\
  \ and realized their love and kindness is incomparable.\n\nHowever, it\u2019s in\
  \ these moments of connection with the unknown that I appreciate being forced to\
  \ leave my comfort zone, because for me, getting to know new places and encounter\
  \ new people expands my sensibility, and it\u2019s something I can translate into\
  \ writing, and into art. Affection and reflections come from unexpected places,\
  \ letting me know that being far away from home will always be worth it."
