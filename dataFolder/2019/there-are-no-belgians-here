Text: "If you\u2019re studying political science, European or international affairs,\
  \ communication or even European law, and you\u2019re not too keen on becoming a\
  \ politician yourself, chances are you have considered a career in Brussels \u2013\
  \ the \u201CEuropean bubble.\u201D\n\nBeing no exception, I too was fascinated by\
  \ the glamorous institutions circling Rue de la Loi or facing Place du Luxembourg.\
  \ The flags, the titles, the big-lettered forefronts and the army of men and women\
  \ in suits that administered, reformed and oversaw the continent intimidated me\
  \ greatly. But I also wanted to see it up close.\n\nAs such, you can imagine my\
  \ joy and excitement when it was announced that I had won the first edition of EUinMyRegion\u2019\
  s contest for bloggers, and had received as a prize 3 weeks of training in the heart\
  \ of Europe. \n\nBefore reaching the city, however, I had to overcome a rather small\
  \ \u2013 but persistent \u2013 problem, namely my dislike of flying. Tarom, the\
  \ Romanian national carrier, transported me from Timisoara to Bucharest, from Bucharest\
  \ to Strasbourg (where it dropped off several of Romania\u2019s MEPs, who then went\
  \ on to argue with one another in the European Parliament\u2019s Committee on Civil\
  \ Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) with regard to the government\u2019\
  s repeated breaches of the independence of justice) and finally from Strasbourg\
  \ to Brussels.\n\nI stepped off the plane sporting a rather greenish skin color\
  \ and went on to my next Herculean labor \u2013 pushing, dragging and forcing my\
  \ sizable luggage around the Zaventem Airport, onto the train, then a bus, and finally\
  \ on the streets, until I reached my new home for 3 weeks.\n\nPatiently guided by\
  \ the project coordinator, Anna, my 60-kg managed to pull all the 20-kg worth of\
  \ clothing to a flat in Avenue Louise, located in a central and rather fancy part\
  \ of in Brussels. From up on the 9th floor, my new home overlooked the Abby Park\
  \ and revealed the skyline of the city, and it was also 40 minutes away from the\
  \ center by foot, or 20 minutes by tram (the trusty tram no. 93).\n\nThe first week\
  \ passed within a breath\u2019s time. Every morning I would go to work like any\
  \ other inhabitant of Brussels, and that alone was a reason for pride. In the evening\
  \ I would visit the city center and indulge in my love for waffles. \n\nAt the same\
  \ time, I got to know my flatmates, the other two winners of the competition \u2013\
  \ the cheerful and active Mari and my fellow political science major and friend,\
  \ Amaury. Similarly, the third week passed in a second, as we patrolled the Parliament\
  \ and Place du Luxembourg, eating, listening and learning side by side with interns\
  \ and journalists. \n\nSurrounded by journalists, typing away time-sensitive articles\
  \ on their laptops, and officials of the Commission, I was dazzled by the world\
  \ of the \u201CEuropean bubble.\u201D Portuguese, Germans, French, Spanish, Polish,\
  \ Romanians and so many others went before me, talking about agriculture policies\
  \ and measures against pollution, ways in which to allocate development funds and\
  \ the local needs of various regions across the continent. Together they were connected\
  \ in interest and exuded competence. They seemed like a new nation, brought together\
  \ by needs of the Union, with their own dress code, language, and habits of the\
  \ mind, now disconnected from their places of origin.\n\nSimilarly, when I would\
  \ wait in line at a store or enjoy a meal at a restaurant, six or seven languages\
  \ would spark up around me, only to be then replaced and complemented by a perfect\
  \ English or French. The young people I met and made friends with, just like the\
  \ older officials and journalists, came from all over Europe and refreshed and re-vitalized\
  \ the bubble once more. This was a nation of immigrants, but it was a fresh and\
  \ daring one, competent and aware of its task \u2013 governing the European Union.\n\
  \nAnd eventually, I realized \u2013 I had spent three weeks in Brussels, the capital\
  \ of Belgium, but hardly met a Belgian. The bubble was populated by so many nationalities\
  \ that it was hard to find a local. There are no Belgians here, I thought. But there\
  \ are a lot of Europeans."
