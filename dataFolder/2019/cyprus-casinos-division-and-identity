Text: "I was certainly dragging the trip back to my mundane, academic life across\
  \ the ocean. Visiting this tiny island after such a long time had brought back so\
  \ many memories. As I was trying to absorb the sunlight through the window of the\
  \ plane, I found myself feeling nostalgic about Nicosia, the world\u2019s last divided\
  \ capital. The barbed wires and check points that separate the northern and southern\
  \ part of the city and the sluggish life in the heat of the old part of the town.\
  \ My lingering on the colors and the smells of Nicosia came to an abrupt halt when\
  \ I noticed that someone was staring at me.\n\tI tried to ignore the intense looks\
  \ of this stranger sitting across the plane. I could sense that he wanted to initiate\
  \ a conversation. I was reluctant to talk about where I was from, as I was feeling\
  \ so guilty about leaving my birthplace. Neither did I want to talk about my final\
  \ destination, the United States, as I was tired of hearing assumptions about how\
  \ wealthy I must have been in order to be able to study there. Thinking about these\
  \ questions irritated me. If only I could have direct flights! Unfortunately, I\
  \ always had to first stop in Turkey as it was the only country that recognized\
  \ the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC).\n\u201C\u2013 Are you a foreigner?\u201D\
  \n\u201C\u2013 No, I just happened to have blue eyes.\u201D (reluctant)\n\u201C\
  - Oh, you are a Cypriot? You speak Turkish with a cute accent.\u201D\n\u201C\u2013\
  I come here almost every weekend! The casinos, you know\u2026\u201D (simpering)\n\
  \u201C\u2026..\u201D\n\u201CWhat is your favorite thing about Cyprus?\u201D\n\u201C\
  -Its diversity and historical places.\u201D\n\u201C-Historical places? In Northern\
  \ Cyprus? You are a funny girl! The only historical places I know in TRNC are casinos\
  \ and night clubs.\u201D\n\tI felt a knot in my throat. I did not expect to find\
  \ out that someone whom I shared the same ethnicity and language (though I seemed\
  \ to have a \u201Ccute accent\u201D) knew so little about Cyprus. And yet, I grew\
  \ up hearing repetitively the notorious quote of Mr Denktas, the founder of the\
  \ unrecognized TRNC. According to him, those living on the island were \u201Ceither\
  \ Turkish or Greek,\u201D and the only living beings who could be considered \u201C\
  Cypriots\u201D were the wild donkeys that lived on the Karpaz peninsula. \nAnd yet,\
  \ how could I feel so distant to this guy? How could he fail to know about the Gothic\
  \ structure of the Church of Agia Sophia, which was converted to today\u2019s Selimiye\
  \ Mosque? How could he fail to acknowledge the roots of the historical building\
  \ of Bedesten, which go all the way back to the 16th century and include not only\
  \ Ottoman but also Byzantine, Lusignan and Venetian characteristics? Was he not\
  \ even aware of the more recent historical places, such as the Great Inn and the\
  \ Arabahmet Quarter, which consists of the finest examples of the typical Ottoman\
  \ architecture?\n\tEven though I was trying to look aloof, I was getting more and\
  \ more restless in my head. Did this guy know anything about pilavuna, our traditional\
  \ pastry with cheese and halloumi? Was he willing to taste it at Asmaalti Bereket\
  \ Firini, one of the oldest bakeries of Nicosia? Has he ever heard of molohiya,\
  \ the jute leaves that local women sort together with their neighbors while sitting\
  \ outside their houses in the summer? \n\tI realized that portraying the separation\
  \ in Cyprus solely as an ethnic division between Turkish and Greek speaking Cypriots\
  \ was too simplistic. It is true that Cyprus is divided. It is also true that there\
  \ are casinos, night clubs, and Turkish military bases in the north. Nonetheless,\
  \ there is so much more that makes Cyprus, Cyprus. Its languages \u201Cwith cute\
  \ accents,\u201D its ethnicities, its architecture, and its history consist of an\
  \ amalgamation of various civilizations. What a fascinating, complex, tiny island!"
