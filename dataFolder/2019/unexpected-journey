Text: "Jaipur, the largest city of Rajasthan was founded by Jai Singh II in 1727.\
  \ The landscape of Jaipur takes your breath away, the city is not only well maintained\
  \ but very clean. After the mad rush of Delhi NCR, Jaipur acted as a soothing balm.\
  \ The city has a rich cultural heritage and an amazing architecture. Every spot\
  \ in Jaipur has a story to narrate and one can see a sense of pride in common people\
  \ when they describe the city past. An ideal Jaipur tour should be of four days,\
  \ in which 3 days can be spent exploring Jaipur and rest one day can be spent visiting\
  \ Ajmer and Pushkar.\n\nQuick Tip: Few of the must-see places in Jaipur are Hawa\
  \ Mahal, City Palace, Jantar Mantar, Jal Mahal etc. In forts, one can see Amer Fort,\
  \ Jai Garh Fort, Nahargarh Fort \u2013 for all these one can easily get a consolidated\
  \ ticket of Rs 100. It is always advisable to go for a consolidated ticket as it\
  \ not only provides value for money but also saves a lot of time.\n\nHawa Mahal:\n\
  Hawa Mahal is made of pink sandstone and is five stories tall. The legend behind\
  \ Hawa Mahal says that the royalty built the Mahal so that the royal women folk\
  \ can see the whole city from the Mahal without being observed by commoners. It\
  \ was truly fun peeping through the Jharokha, with a knowledge that you can watch\
  \ everyone, without being watched. Does this sound something out of Sherlock Homes\
  \ movie??\n\n\n\nCity Palace:\nThe next spot to be covered is City palace, very\
  \ near to Hawa Mahal, almost walking distance. It is right in the center of old\
  \ city. This is the palace where the royalty still lives, so half part of the palace\
  \ is unapproachable. It has got Chandra Mahal and Mubarak Mahal, also it contains\
  \ a museum. I would suggest spending some time over here, and see the beauty not\
  \ only of the architecture but also carvings on the door and walls.\n\nJantar Mantar:\n\
  Jantar Mantar is definitely an astronomical marvel. It was built by Sawai Jai Singh\
  \ II, who himself took a keen interest in the movement of sun, moon, and planets.\
  \ It is the best-preserved observatory. It contains the equipment\u2019s used by\
  \ the royalty to study the planetary positions. One can also view Hawa Mahal from\
  \ here. The Samrat Yantra\u2019s or in other words the giant Sundial, its shadow\
  \ can easily tell the time of the day.\n\n\n\nAmer Fort:\nThis fort is located 11\
  \ kms away from Jaipur and was originally build by Meena Rulers. The fort is located\
  \ on top of the hills.\n\n\n\nQuick Tip: A word of caution is that many travel packages\
  \ will tell you that you can cover all the three forts in one day, but practically\
  \ it is very difficult. No doubt that the forts are located very near to each other\
  \ but covering one fort requires at least 3 hours and a lot of stamina.\n\n\n\n\
  Best Time To Visit Jaipur:\nThe best time to visit Jaipur is from October to March,\
  \ after that it gets very hot.\n\nAdvice: Also would suggest doing good research\
  \ before visiting any spot so that one knows a bit of History about the place in\
  \ advance. It would be good if one can hire a guide for Jantar Mantar and Amer Fort.\n\
  \n\n \nMarket: In the evening one can visit Bapu Bazar, Nehru bazar for shopping.\
  \ The streets are lively and well-lit bazaars are filled with bright turbans and\
  \ ethnic attire, hand-dyed and embroidered textiles, pretty jewelry and delicious\
  \ food.\n\nFood: Amazing street food is present, do enjoy that. The food of Jaipur\
  \ is yummy but it might be oily and too spicy for some. The food is not very expensive\
  \ over here, one can eat a good meal in Rs 150/-"
