Text: "I am a 19 y.o girl studying international relations with lots of interest in\
  \ getting to know people outside my own society. But this story will begin with\
  \ a bit of twist. All i did was signed up on Tinder--of course not to travel--but\
  \ to find 'someone'. I know it sounds very na\xEFve, but at that time i was very\
  \ interested to explore a whole new world of dating. Long story short, I matched\
  \ with this guy who is a foreigner but i thought he is just a normal immigrant,\
  \ i didn't expect anything. As time goes, i found out that he is an asylum seeker\
  \ originally came from the Middle East, and moved with his family to a city called\
  \ Puncak. I have been to the city once because they have the biggest zoo in Indonesia,\
  \ and the most popular one as well. We keep in touch until now, and there was one\
  \ time when i decided to meet him in another city between my city and Puncak, which\
  \ is Bogor. I commuted from my uni to meet him in Bogor for 45 mins and it was also\
  \ another whole world for me, i never been there unless going with family by car.\
  \ The view from the train i ride in was so different with the railway running throughout\
  \ Jakarta. \n\nHe finally came after i waited for him nearby the station for a good\
  \ 15 mins. I thought we were just going to hang out in Bogor and i was wearing dress\
  \ so i thought it wouldn't be somewhere else other than mall. But, then he brought\
  \ me to a 3 hours road trip with his motorbike, which i never done in my entire\
  \ life. It was amazing, my life was never been that exciting. We had a good conversation\
  \ as well, especially when he found out that i know some things about what is going\
  \ on in his country and in that region. When we arrived at a villa, nearby his house,\
  \ i was introduced to his cute little brother named Muhammad. I'm just amazed to\
  \ the fact that I'm lucky enough to meet them. I am lucky to meet all these beautiful\
  \ kind people who look foreign but very Indonesian in the heart. And also! The Food!\
  \ I finally tried the Middle Eastern dessert that i couldn't find back in Jakarta,\
  \ which as i expected, tasted good. I also got a chance to see his mom and dad,\
  \ but unfortunately didn't talk to them because they don't really speak Indonesian.\
  \ Only their sons do. He kept asking me if i was happy to be with him and to be\
  \ 'taken' to a place i have never been before, and I answered, I am beyond happy!"
