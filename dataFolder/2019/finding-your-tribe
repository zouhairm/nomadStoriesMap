Text: "Swerving through rush hour traffic in Hanoi, I gripped the straps of my backpack\
  \ as tightly with my hands as my knees locked on to the seat beneath me. \u201C\
  You\u2019ll only need a shirt, maybe a rain jacket,\u201D said my driver aka my\
  \ connect to the Sapa mountain trek I\u2019d signed up for. I\u2019d stuffed my\
  \ toiletries, a thin thermal, a jumper, my camera, and a rainproof sleeve encasing\
  \ my computer into the small knapsack. The rest of my luggage had been stored in\
  \ a random hotel lobby, where I\u2019d been reassured my belongings would be kept\
  \ safe. Dropping me off at the train station to fend for my own, the driver bolted\
  \ off. I\u2019d only been in Vietnam for a few short hours and yet the adventure\
  \ was already in full swing. \n\nTaking an overnight train to the northern mountainous\
  \ region of the country, I linked up with my guide: a tiny framed woman named May\
  \ from the indigenous Dzao tribe. She suggested I swap out my freshly minted Nikes\
  \ for a pair of rainboots. Though part of me resisted, I decided to lean in, trusted\
  \ the local, and rented myself a pair of highly fashionable rubber boots. As soon\
  \ as they were strapped on my eyes glanced up to meet the rumble of a relentless\
  \ downpour. Let\u2019s hope that waterproof laptop sleeve lives up to its name.\n\
  \nWe scaled up a shoddy makeshift hiking trail for six hours through frigid temperatures.\
  \ Sideways rain smacked our faces while we cautiously traversed dangerously slick\
  \ jungle terrain. My heart pounded a drum solo that only a squirrel on Adderall\
  \ could keep up with. Lactic acid built up enough to burn the hair off my legs.\
  \ My occasional asthma flared up briefly, asking for a hit of the rescue inhaler\
  \ I\u2019d fortuitously packed. At a certain point I questioned what I got myself\
  \ into, but on the other side of the inquiry the rain let up and massive expanses\
  \ of natural wonder answered, offering breathtaking views of cascading landscapes.\
  \ \n\nAt sunset, we arrived at the accommodations for the evening - May\u2019s family\
  \ home. We unwound by the fire pit, cracking jokes and sharing tales from our personal\
  \ lives by way of my elementary Vietnamese language skills and charismatic storytelling.\
  \ Dining upon simple meals full of homemade goodness, I was whisked back to sense\
  \ memories reminiscent of the upbringing provided by my grandparents. This household,\
  \ one so many thousands of miles away from my own in America, felt so close to home.\
  \ We raised toasts of backyard brewed rice wine as they welcomed me in under their\
  \ roof as one of their own. \n\nDescending the mountain the following day, the obstacles\
  \ presented by the environment couldn\u2019t challenge the full value of this experience.\
  \ I could go home now and be completely satisfied with my stay in Vietnam. Reaching\
  \ the endpoint of the adventure, I offered May and her family a gift of thanksgiving\
  \ for the moments of reconnection with my heritage. These are the kinds of memories\
  \ I will forever carry on in my spirit. She loosened a silver bracelet from her\
  \ wrist and fastened it onto mine. \u201CSo we can always be with you,\u201D she\
  \ said. \u201CRemember, you always have family up here.\u201D No cold couldn\u2019\
  t break through the warmth of our parting embrace. \n\nA part of me wanted to stay.\
  \ From the way this family has moved my heart, a part of me will never leave Sapa."
