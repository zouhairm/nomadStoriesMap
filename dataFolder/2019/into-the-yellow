Text: "I tugged myself in his arms a little tighter. My body was sore from being stationed\
  \ in the same position since hours and it was only 12 in the afternoon. Feels like\
  \ living many days in one, experiencing every moment pass me by. \n\nWe were at\
  \ a safari just this morning, chasing elephants and disappointment. The coach slowed\
  \ the jeep and shushed us, a group of 5 crammed together. My boyfriend and I had\
  \ met this lady who was accompanied by her two daughters, outside the ticketing\
  \ counter of Bandipur National Park. I, on his suggestion volunteered to ask her\
  \ if they wanted to pool a jeep. Thrifty goes with my personality, I guess. So here\
  \ we were, a bunch of strangers, sharing binoculars and raincoats, to protect us\
  \ from untimely rains. Gasping together as the younger daughter spotted a blue glistening\
  \ kingfisher from a considerable distance. \n\n\u2018Good eye,\u2019 we called out\
  \ in unison. \n\nThe coach was convinced that there was a tiger in the vicinity.\
  \ We sat in the stationed jeep, brimming with anticipation, rising an inch from\
  \ our seats every time we heard the leaves crackle. He then reversed the vehicle\
  \ trying to move towards the sound of the deer call. \n\n\u201CThey are warning\
  \ all the others in the herd about the threat nearby,\u201D he stated. \n\nThe threat\
  \ I couldn\u2019t faintly sense or see and apparently neither could the one with\
  \ the \u2018good eye\u2019. We waited for over an hour for the big cat to surface,\
  \ but now even the deers had gone distant and silent. \n\nWe decided to head back.\
  \ Our safari was over. We \u2018almost\u2019 spotted a tiger at a tiger reserve.\
  \ \n\nI was secretly relieved. Having given in to the boy\u2019s obsession towards\
  \ exploring the wild, had me sleeping at a lodge last night that was accessible\
  \ by boars. Wild boars, if I may add. I had spent the night jumping to the edge\
  \ of the bed at the slightest sound. Imagining that a knock and grunt on the door\
  \ would follow. I wanted to utilize the next 2 few hours in our cab from Bandipur\
  \ to Mysuru, the final city of our tri state trip across Southern India, for that\
  \ one thing I was obsessed with \u2013 sleep. \n\nI positioned my head on his lap,\
  \ instructed the driver to not subject us to any more raunchy music and stick to\
  \ the mellow. The music here clearly lacked moderation. I was comfortably asleep,\
  \ till my body got sore. It was just 12 and felt like I had lived my day already.\
  \ \n\nI sat up to straighten my back and looked ahead to the road. We were just\
  \ passing a signboard that read \u2018Welcome to Gundlupete\u2019. A small city\
  \ on the way I thought and looked to my right squinting my groggy eyes. \n\n\u201C\
  Sir, could you stop please.\u201D, I immediately instructed the driver.  I shook\
  \ the boyfriend out of his sleep and frantically squeaked \u201CLOOOK!\u201D. \n\
  \nWhat we witnessed were miles of sunflower fields in full bloom, staring at us\
  \ on both sides of the road. As far as we could look, all we saw was a riot of yellows,\
  \ browns and greens melting right into the blue sky, freshly bathed after a rain\
  \ shower. They stood in solidarity, facing the sun and calling out to us to stand\
  \ with them. We jumped right out the car and ran towards the fields, like two kids\
  \ in Legoland; only this was the Legoland for grown-ups. It was nature in its full\
  \ force, almost mocking us with its unfiltered beauty. No concrete marvel could\
  \ soothe the soul the way walking across the field did. The petals of the flowers\
  \ dipped in the brightest yellow I had ever seen, curled inside. They were acknowledging\
  \ our presence and now acting coy. I walked across the field of flowers that stood\
  \ almost as tall as me. Taking in a whiff of that bittersweet smell that transported\
  \ me to Saturday evenings spent with grandma applying grounded sunflower oil to\
  \ my hair. \n\nMaybe years later, I\u2019d be transported to this memory. To the\
  \ wonder I could have missed but didn\u2019t.  \n\nI am never sleeping on a road\
  \ trip again."
