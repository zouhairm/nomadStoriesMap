Text: "The Mirabilia\nOn a certain Sunday, in October 2018, my friend Maddy and I\
  \ decided to meet in Pune, a cosy city in Maharashtra, India. Pune is seven hours\
  \ away from where I live, I was excited to meet Maddy and visit Pune again, thus\
  \ chose the fastest mode of travel, just an hour in a flight and I meet this city.\
  \ I was packing my bags, two days prior my travel and I received a phone call, it\
  \ was Maddy, he said that he couldn't make it as he had received an interview call\
  \ from a company, he had awaited to work with for a long time. I felt exhilarated\
  \ and anxious at the same time, he was about to make his dreams come true, but now,\
  \ I was at a nodus; whether to continue or cancel the trip. I continued packing\
  \ my bag obliviously, while wishing him luck and hung up. I saw a well organised\
  \ day-pack, ready to be zipped, the moment I returned to my reality. It took me\
  \ few seconds of closed eyes contemplation and then I smiled and said, \"It's my\
  \ first solo.\" \n'Backpacker's Panda' was the hostel, we had chosen as our haven\
  \ in Pune. I didn't know that a hostel would entice me more than any luxurious hotel.\
  \ I saw people with eyes full of vivid experiences; age, nationality, culture, religion,\
  \ sex seemed obsolete. The cute guy at the reception table showed me my room, I\
  \ told him that it was my first time in a hostel, he told me, welcome to self-dependency,\
  \ \"aahaa, impressive\", I thought.  The extrovert in me thought of going out there\
  \ in the books laden lobby and start a conversation with all the cool travellers,\
  \ the introvert in me thought of resting in the room. I being an ambivert, decided\
  \ to go for a stroll, in the lane where Backpacker's Panda resides. It was an early\
  \ evening hour and a peaceful vicinity with less commutation and more trees, I hadn't\
  \ been in this part of the city ever, I walked in the faintly lit lane with soothing\
  \ greens, I was unaware of the life long journey I was about to embark. I touched\
  \ every tree I walked by, I told this certain tree, \"Isn't true luxury realising\
  \ existence\" and then I pause, I heard something, I turned around, with my hand\
  \ still in touch with the birch; nothing in sight. Suddenly, I felt a jolt of energy\
  \ pass through me, I felt sheer joy, I was in rapprochement with this primitive\
  \ connoisseur. I could feel its colossal presence, syncing with the peck of each\
  \ existential spectre in me. I felt the realm change, I experienced an orgasm, but\
  \ it wasn't physical, it was emotional, I felt dew drops of my tears roll down my\
  \ cheeks. Then, it let me free, it let me move forth, I move farther and continued\
  \ my journey, with my head held high and tears of joy rolling by; I didn't realise\
  \ that I had spectators, a couple, who were passing by, staring at me, unaware at\
  \ what point they caught me in my trans, I smiled at them and started to return\
  \ at my temporary haven. Besotted but I had to return to the reality. \nThe cool\
  \ backpackers were still at the lobby, some reading, some smoking, some rendezvousing;\
  \ I stood in the centre of the lobby and said, \"Hi, I am Prachi, going to spend\
  \ few days here and I intend to know your stories.\" I hear a second of mute and\
  \ then, 'Hi, I am Natasha, come over, sit with us.\"  \n           I was packing\
  \ my bag, on the fourth day of my stay in Pune, it was my day of return. I heard\
  \ a knock at the door, Natasha, Vikram, Chris and Micheal were at my door with hands\
  \ full of leaves, I recognised the leaves, these were the leaves of the same trees\
  \ that spoke with me, I had shared my experience with them, they knew what it meant\
  \ to me, they hadn't asked for any explanation or hadn't judged my experience. Natasha\
  \ told me that I travelled realms. I didn't expect to find a realm of my own."
