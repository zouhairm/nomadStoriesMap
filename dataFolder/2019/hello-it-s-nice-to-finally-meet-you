Text: "Traveling was never a foreign concept to me. Planes, airports, strangers and\
  \ the unfamiliar were in many ways familiar. But also tied with family. Never a\
  \ bad thing, but travel often meant family vacation, family gathering\u2014family-related\
  \ something.\n\nTraveling tied with solo was what was as foreign as the man who\
  \ spoke no English next to me on my first international flight alone. It was exhilarating\
  \ and scary\u2014my body had goose bumps for the entire flight. \n\nEyelids rising\
  \ and the plane descending, I knew it was time for me to prepare for landing. It\
  \ was like no other flight I\u2019ve taken because this time I was in a land that\
  \ had to tied to the word family. Weird. \n\nShuffling out of the narrow hallway\
  \ to the mouth of the plane\u2014brought new feelings I\u2019d never met before\
  \ within myself. A stranger to my body that my mind had never met before. I trusted\
  \ it, I trusted you. Whatever it was that lead me out of the plane, gave me a high\
  \ and I was hooked. \n\nThe breaking through of levels of comforts I never knew\
  \ I had capabilities to break. I was the fish out of water, I was an American in\
  \ France. A lone American in France. A stranger to myself and those bustling around\
  \ me. \u201CLet\u2019s acquaint ourselves,\u201D I said to myself, France, and to\
  \ travel."
