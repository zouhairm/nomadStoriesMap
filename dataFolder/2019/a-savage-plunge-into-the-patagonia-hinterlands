Text: "He\u2019s dead now, but I\u2019ll never forget the moment I met him. It was\
  \ a balmy, traffic snarled mid-afternoon somewhere along the bustling Av. Roque\
  \ S\xE1enz Pe\xF1a in the old port of Buenos Aires, Argentina. The French doors\
  \ opened to a sun-drenched third-floor patio and the Chileans I found on the internet\
  \ were leading me on a tour of the flat I had just handed over a month\u2019s rent\
  \ for. \n\nAs they took me into the kitchen, a lanky, nervous looking creature emerged\
  \ from the back room. The first thing I noticed besides his wild hair, were his\
  \ eyes. They had the look of genuine restlessness. I sensed that behind those eyes\
  \ was a kind of raw wisdom that made me uncomfortable.    \n\nBut there was something\
  \ curious about those eyes. Something magnetic. \u201CAh\u2026\u201D, the younger\
  \ Chilean said gesturing towards the guy, \u201CThis is Michal. He\u2019s from Poland.\u201D\
  \ I smiled and nodded as he passed us in the hall.\n\nSince I had already paid,\
  \ and the apartment was right in the beating core of it all, I told the Chileans\
  \ that I was happy with it and we shook hands.\n\nMy girlfriend at the time, a local\
  \ journalist, helped move me in a few days later. After I got settled I went out\
  \ for a smoke on the balcony. Sirens blared in the distance as I hung over the metal\
  \ railing staring out at the Rio de la Plata, barely visible in the hazy distance.\
  \  \n\nI came back in and plopped down on the couch. The Polish guy with the eyes\
  \ came in and sat down across from me. I couldn\u2019t remember his name. I nodded\
  \ and smiled awkwardly. We spoke in Spanish because I wasn\u2019t sure if he knew\
  \ English. He told me his name and how he had been living in Dublin for over a decade.\
  \ \n\n\u201CSo, then you speak English?\u201D I asked with a grin. He smiled mischievously\
  \ and said in Spanish, \u201CYah, but I don\u2019t like speaking English.\u201D\
  \ It didn\u2019t take long for us to develop a unique kind of trust. \n\nOne night\
  \ a few days later we polished off a bottle of Cuban rum and walked down to the\
  \ narrow, cobblestoned streets of the hip San Telmo district a few blocks away.\
  \ As we moved from patio to patio, bar to bar, I was impressed by Michal\u2019s\
  \ insatiable desire to communicate. He was capable of engaging with anybody. The\
  \ bartender, the patrons, the musicians on the street, and even the local plaza\
  \ \u201Cborrachos\u201D (Spanish for \u201Cdrunks\u201D). \n\nBut what impressed\
  \ me the most about Michal was that everybody he talked to seemed to be taken by\
  \ his charm. You could call him a diplomat of sorts. But he was also an enigma.\
  \ He was never satisfied with stasis, and always preferred to move. For him, life\
  \ wasn\u2019t about simply finding one place and staying put. Life was movement.\
  \ Movement was life. \n\nEarly that morning we both had our fill of the nightlife.\
  \ We finally stumbled back to the flat in the pre-dawn hours like crazed rum-soaked\
  \ castaways. I noticed some early commuters dart across the street to avoid our\
  \ boisterous advance. \n\nBack at the apartment we continued our revelry. We spoke\
  \ passionately of freedom. Of life. Of movement. Of adventure. We were howling drunk\
  \ on the thought that life could be so much more if we were only big enough to step\
  \ out the door of the apartment and seek out something greater than ourselves. \
  \ \n\nAt one point Michal looked at me and throwing his hands in the air he said,\
  \ \u201CI just want to feel alive!\u201D \n\nWe were way too loud that night and\
  \ the Chileans took notice and we were evicted. \u201CMy brother needs the room.\u201D\
  \ The younger Chilean told me. \u201CSorry about the short notice.\u201D I took\
  \ the hint. \n\nThe eviction was inconvenient, but it was the exact spark we needed.\
  \ So, we decided that we\u2019d set off on an adventure. To Patagonia. All the way\
  \ to \u201Cel fin del mundo\u201D, the end of the world, in Tierra del Fuego, the\
  \ \u201CLand of Fire\u201D. \n\nSo we did. And this is the story of our journey.\
  \ A journey to world\u2019s end:"
