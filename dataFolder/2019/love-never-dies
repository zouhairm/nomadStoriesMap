Text: "A simple and unassuming cemetery lay by the side of a two-lane road, just a\
  \ short walk from the center of a small town in northern France. A low stone wall\
  \ surrounds the grassy piece of land which serves as a resting place for Commonwealth\
  \ soldiers from the Second World War. Uniform rows of gravestones on either side\
  \ of the center walkway mark over 4,000 lives lost. \n\nAs I walked alone through\
  \ the cemetery on that Friday afternoon, I was struck by one line on their headstones.\
  \ They had the usual details of their name and rank, but beneath that, a line of\
  \ text told their age. Most all of the men who had fallen in the summer of 1944\
  \ were just teenagers or barely more. The ages of most of the men were 18 \u2013\
  \ 21 years old. That day, I was just 21 years old and couldn't imagine making the\
  \ sacrifice that they had.\n\nThousands died on the D-Day beaches in Normandy. Some\
  \ died fighting in the countryside trying to liberate the towns. Most had been given\
  \ a proper burial, first in the countryside and then in cemeteries. But for some,\
  \ their bodies were never to be recovered.\n\nAcross the road from the cemetery\
  \ stands a monument to those men whose bodies were never found. 1,808 names chiseled\
  \ onto the walls of the seven alcoves. Stone benches sit beneath the names to give\
  \ comfort to those who visit. \n\nWhen I arrived at the memorial, it was the middle\
  \ of July. About six weeks after the annual remembrance of the landing at Normandy\
  \ on June 6, 1944. As I walked up to the memorial, I noticed on the benches there\
  \ were a few small handmade crosses sitting left on them. My eyes glanced at the\
  \ crosses, then stopped at one that made my heart stop. It said - \u201CTo Freddie,\
  \ Your loving wife and brother.\u201D My god, it had been 49 years since Freddie\
  \ had left them. The made the journey from England to pay their respects.\n\nThen\
  \ I wondered, where is his name? It's here somewhere. My eyes searched the two walls\
  \ of the alcove where the bench was under I finally found him. Frederick he was\
  \ listed as. I can't remember his middle or last name, but I remember it was such\
  \ a long name. Unexpected since they simply called him Freddie. Somewhere I have\
  \ a photograph of his name.\n\nI've wondered if somehow Freddie's wife and brother\
  \ are still alive. It's not impossible, although it has been 26 years since that\
  \ day I saw the cross they left to him. \n\nNo matter how you lose someone, be it\
  \ from war, an accident, illness or old age, we carry those we love in our hearts\
  \ because love never dies."
