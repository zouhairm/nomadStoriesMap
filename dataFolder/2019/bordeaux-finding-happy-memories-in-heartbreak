Text: "A month before our trip to Bordeaux, I found messages on my boyfriend\u2019\
  s phone between him and another girl. I was, of course, devastated. But also still\
  \ very much in love. So in love that I thought I needed to fight to save something\
  \ that maybe wasn\u2019t there anymore. So, we decided to try. And in trying, head\
  \ on a weekend away to Bordeaux, France. \n\nTo be totally honest, the real reason\
  \ Bordeaux was chosen was the insane price of the flights: \n\n\u201CThey\u2019\
  re \xA320.\u201D\n\n\u201CEach way?\u201D\n\n\u201CNope.\u201D\n\n\u201CWhat?! Book\
  \ book book!\u201D\n\n\u201CWe don\u2019t even know what there is to do there!\u201D\
  \n\n\u201CAh we know there\u2019s wine, there\u2019s cheese \u2013 what else do\
  \ we need?\u201D\n\n\u201CGood point\u2026 Bordeaux it is!\u201D\n\nAnd he was right.\
  \ Wine, cheese, and a smidge of culture - what more do you need for a holiday? And\
  \ what more do you need to save a relationship..? \n\nWe flew out on Easter weekend,\
  \ and the city worked its magic straight away. The sun came out, and we spent the\
  \ first day wandering down cobbled streets, our only aim to find somewhere half\
  \ decent for dinner later, or maybe for another wine. \n\nThe city itself is quite\
  \ stunning. Set on the banks of the Garonne, and most famous for this gorgeous reflecting\
  \ pool on the Place de la Bourse (aside from the wine, of course), it feels homely\
  \ straight away. It\u2019s the kind of place you can see yourself in in countless\
  \ situations \u2013 an apartment to live in while you weekend at local vineyards;\
  \ a city to visit once you\u2019ve won the lottery and own one of said vineyards,\
  \ maybe a place to retire in. It feels relaxed, in that typical French way of long\
  \ lunches, hour-long coffees, and the odd midday glass of red. \n\nBack in the apartment,\
  \ this feeling continued, and we ambled around naked, glasses of wine in hand, leisurely\
  \ getting ready for dinner. It felt like us again. Like we could forget everything\
  \ that had happened over the last month or so, and just live in this lovely little\
  \ French bubble forever. \n\nIn the evening, the city maintained that slow, relaxing\
  \ vibe, but with a little added buzz. The lights were on, restaurants full, and\
  \ bars spilling out. We spent the evening indulging ourselves in a gorgeous little\
  \ place we\u2019d come across earlier. For the food in Bordeaux, there\u2019s so\
  \ much I could say. It\u2019s classic French, as you\u2019ll never experience in\
  \ a London bistro. Steaks so rare they might still be mooing, or duck, rabbit, fish.\
  \ Breadbaskets full of the freshest, most rustic bread, to go alongside beautifully\
  \ curated charcuterie boards, and all washed down with that famous Bordeaux red.\
  \ \n\nWe ate and drank and talked, like we hadn\u2019t in a long time. We told each\
  \ other how much we loved each other, and thought about where our next trip should\
  \ be, as this one was proving so wonderful. \n\nFor three days, we repeated this\
  \ new routine of strolling around (or maybe rolling by day three) this city, full\
  \ of class and romance, not worrying what the time was, or what was waiting back\
  \ home. \n\nAnd then, suddenly, we boarded a plane home, and once we hit the tarmac,\
  \ the bubble burst. Gone was the time and luxury to not think of our regular lives\
  \ at home, and I realised that not even a weekend as fantastic as that, in a place\
  \ so beautiful, could fix this. \n\nI later found out that while I was full of blissful\
  \ ignorance, he\u2019d been checking his phone for messages from the girl the whole\
  \ time. Gutting, but somehow it hasn\u2019t tarnished my view of the city. I still\
  \ remember the trip as real moments of happiness before the sadness took over. It\
  \ might not be much, but in the midst of heartbreak, a bit of joy is the last thing\
  \ you expect to find. To be able to keep those good memories, and write about them\
  \ now with a nostalgic smile, rather than bitterness, is nothing short of a triumph.\
  \ So thank you Bordeaux, if you can make me feel like that then, I can\u2019t wait\
  \ to see how you feel when I\u2019m happy before I get there."
