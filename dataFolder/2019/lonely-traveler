Text: "India is a country with lot if culture and festival traditions and similarly\
  \ i have heard about the festival of holi celebrated in the konkan areas if Maharashtra.\n\
  So in this march i decided to explore and to know what this festival actually means\
  \ to the people who celebrate holi with lot of enthusiasm and happiness.. \nThat\
  \ was a morning i started my journey with the public transport and then rushing\
  \ for a seat and then communicating with lots of people telling them about our rituals\
  \ and then knowing about there's and was a great fun.As after reaching there the\
  \ houses with roofs and the people playing lots of games which i never heard of.....\n\
  And really the place where i stayed was the heave like the women who treated me\
  \ with lot of respect  and care and then the traditional dance and burning of the\
  \ sacred holika ,the rushing of the people of the villega and then having the proper\
  \ traditional fish curry with rice bhakaris was just awesome.on the same night the\
  \ visit to the cultural program was something new as it took place at 12 at night\
  \ and the whole jungle the silence of the village it was just awesome.the next day\
  \ then returning back to home  holding 3big big dabbass means the tiffins consisting\
  \ of various delicious dishes made me so  happy. The people where very best ...\
  \ As humanity still exist. The memories of the trip were really the heart filling\
  \ memories  of my life"
