Text: "That feeling in the pit of my stomach lingered and the intense muscle tension\
  \ remained as I tried to calm myself in the unbalanced bentwood chair. What had\
  \ been an incredible week long trip in Paris had suddenly turned into a nightmare.\
  \ I was completely alone, with no access to funds except for the 5 euro and 60 cents\
  \ I had found at the bottom of my backpack. Feeling utterly miserable, I rested\
  \ my elbows on the small round table in front of me and pushed my fingers through\
  \ my hair, breathing a deep sigh of exasperation. Everyone I\u2019d spoken to, and\
  \ all the blogs I had read online had warned me. Watch your stuff. Keep your pockets\
  \ zipped up. But after days of nothing but pure happiness, in my naivety I had made\
  \ myself believe that nothing would happen. Now the striking brown supple leather\
  \ wallet I\u2019d brought in Orvieto, with the engraved leafy vines was gone. Along\
  \ with my credit cards, my ID cards and that caf\xE9 discount card with nine out\
  \ of the ten squares stamped. Spending hours speaking with the local police, and\
  \ being on hold with my bank to activate my back-up card (which was still yet to\
  \ happen) had drained me of energy. \nNeeding respite from the chaos in my hostel,\
  \ I\u2019d found a small bistro near Gare du Nord and took a seat near the window,\
  \ requesting the cheapest thing on the menu. The bitterness I felt despite my own\
  \ carelessness was no doubt having an impact on the wait staff, who had kept their\
  \ distance since hastily taking my order. Then he spoke in a thick accent. \u201C\
  Do you like football?\u201D After a moment\u2019s confusion I looked up.  On the\
  \ table across from mine, also against the window, was an older man with grey wiry\
  \ hair. He glanced through the glass pane and I looked out at the world cup fans\
  \ he was indicting to on the pavement outside, with French flags draped around them\
  \ like capes. My guard was up, and talking to strangers was the last thing I felt\
  \ like doing, but I gave a half shrug and a grimace to indicate that I was indifferent\
  \ to the sport. \u201CNot really\u201D I said apologetically. He just smiled perceptively\
  \ and told me about his wife. She had never \u2018really\u2019 liked it either.\
  \ I listened as he spoke to me about how he had just been to visit his wife in an\
  \ inner-city care home, something he did a few times a week before returning to\
  \ his home on the suburban fringe. \nThe waitress at some point brought my dish\
  \ over, a small bowl of Garbure and stale bread. While I ate, the man asked me how\
  \ I liked France, and told me about places in the city he used to love to visit\
  \ with his wife.  All too soon I watched the man looking at his watch, before promptly\
  \ standing up and donning his hat. He gave me a knowing smile and an \u201CAu revoir\u201D\
  \ as he left the caf\xE9. I stood up to go too, reaching into my pocket to look\
  \ for the 5 euro and 60 cents I had scourged earlier as the waitress went past.\
  \ Noticing she turned to me \u201COh non. C'est pay\xE9\u201D, giving a nod out\
  \ the window to where I had watched the old man stumble across the street and walk\
  \ into the station. My baffled look made her translate this for me. He had already\
  \ paid. \nI thought about going after him, but knew that between getting across\
  \ the busy street and entering a station like Gare du Nord the chances of finding\
  \ him would be slim. So instead I just smiled, thanked her and made my way to the\
  \ exit. It was only then that I realised that all of the tension I\u2019d previously\
  \ felt was gone, and I felt a jolt of guilt. Despite my animosity the man had succeeded\
  \ in bringing me back from my feelings of irrational resentment toward the French\
  \ people, and I had never even asked him his name."
