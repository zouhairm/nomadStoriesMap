Text: "It was the end of December, in Paris. The weather was brisk, but sunny as I\
  \ stood in line for the Ferris wheel at the Place de la Concorde. \n\nThere was\
  \ a long line in front of me. Couples and larger groups of people chatted together,\
  \ looking at maps and guidebooks and cell phones, pointing things out to each other\
  \ while they conversed, presumably making plans for what they would do next.\n\n\
  I took notice of the woman directly in front of me. She looked like she was a couple\
  \ generations older than me. She wore a simple, plain brown wool coat and had a\
  \ gray silk scarf, folded in a triangle, wrapped around her head and tied under\
  \ her chin. She was straight out of one of my grandmother\u2019s photo albums, pulled\
  \ from the black and white photos from the 30s and 40s of distant relatives recently\
  \ arrived from Poland or Russia and now standing on the steps of their new home.\
  \ \n\nShe waved to a man standing outside the queue, to show him where she was in\
  \ line.  He pointed at his watch obviously wanting to move his day along and not\
  \ happy to take time out for her desire to ride a Ferris wheel. Much as my grandmother\
  \ would have, she brushed her hand through the air, shrugging her shoulders as if\
  \ to say, \u201Cpssh, you can just wait.\u201D After pushing aside his complaint,\
  \ she looked up at the Ferris wheel and seemed mesmerized by its daunting size as\
  \ it loomed over us. She had a glint in her eye like a young child, excited and\
  \ eager to ride. \n\nAt one point I caught her eye and we smiled at each other.\
  \ I suspected that we didn\u2019t speak the same language, but attempted in my limited\
  \ French to talk to her, \u201Cvous \xEAtes juste un?\u201D and I held up my forefinger.\
  \ I don\u2019t think she understood my words, but she knew what I asked. She nodded\
  \ and held up a finger as well, yes, one.  And we smiled. \n\nThe line continued\
  \ to move forward. The attendants filled the gondolas with at least four people\
  \ in them, not letting just one or two people ride alone. \n\nAs we got closer to\
  \ the ride, two women were seated in a car but had no one else with them. The attendant\
  \ looked ahead in the line for another small group. He called out holding up two\
  \ fingers of his right hand. The woman in front of me eagerly raised her hand to\
  \ catch his eye and turned to me with a big smile. She pointed back and forth between\
  \ me and herself, nodding, \u201Cyes? we ride together?\u201D I don\u2019t know\
  \ if I smiled more in agreement to cut ahead in line or at seeing her excitement.\
  \ But, yes, I nodded \u2013 we can go fill the ride together. \n\nWe smiled in greeting\
  \ to the two other women in the gondola and then we all turned to look out our own\
  \ side of the car. \n\nThe other two women and I had our cell phones out, snapping\
  \ photos at each new angle and different height. But my friend from line just sat\
  \ quietly, enjoying the ride and admiring the view, looking out over the streets\
  \ of Paris with a content smile on her face. I took a cue from her and put my cell\
  \ phone down on the second revolution and just watched as the kaleidoscope of the\
  \ city emerged. The Tuileries Garden sat directly below us. The Champs Elysees boldly\
  \ strode towards the Arc de Triumph. The Eiffel Tower rose up majestically in the\
  \ distance. \n\nAfter the ride, departed the gondola and the woman\u2019s companion\
  \ was waiting for her at the exit, ready to pull her away immediately. I didn\u2019\
  t catch her eye again, but I always remember her excitement for the ride and seeing\
  \ the beauty of the city with her at that moment before life swept us back up into\
  \ everyday life."
