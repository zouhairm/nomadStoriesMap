Text: "Exactly 303 days, 15 hours and 42 minutes ago, I graduated from college with\
  \ a degree in Zoology, debt my career plan could never afford and a dream of making\
  \ the world a better place for wildlife. In the time since then, I've moved from\
  \ internship to internship from North Dakota, to Alaska and back to my home state\
  \ of Minnesota. \nI was driving through downtown Duluth, my much-loved \"The 1975\"\
  \ album blasting through the speakers when suddenly it hit me. The artist behind\
  \ the voice I've been listening to since 2014, I haven't the slightest clue who\
  \ that person is. Like a crash, a misplaced feeling floods under my skin and I dissociate\
  \ from the city that has been my home for the past month. I see anew the smokestack-topped\
  \ grey buildings that I pass everyday on my way to work, highlighted by the perfectly\
  \ tinted sunlight of winter's 4:30pm. It occurs to me that for someone else in this\
  \ city, those buildings are their everyday; where they go to work, where they fall\
  \ a little bit more in love with Laura in the break room, where they dream of seeing\
  \ the golden tower of the Pena Palace. Yet for me, that building is and will likely\
  \ remain for the next two months before I move again, a mystery. \nAbove me, the\
  \ Enger tower stands watch-guard over the city like a turkey vulture roosting at\
  \ the top of a tree. Moving my eyes down the rest of the tree, I make out all the\
  \ little buildings that coalesce to make the city of Duluth petioled onto the relatively\
  \ mountainous terrain of the city. \nThe frozen snow-dunes of Lake Superior spans\
  \ out into the distance as far as I can see, and my little white car glides up to\
  \ the light blue bridge that will shoot me out into Superior, Wisconsin. \nIt occurs\
  \ to me just how amazingly large our Earth is. I've lived in four different states\
  \ in the last year, but that means I've only lived in four cities. I've only worked\
  \ at four different places, and I've only seen the world through two eyes. My eyes\
  \ can never look into another's mind. Into another world."
