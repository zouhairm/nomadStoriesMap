Text: "he night never sleeps in Phi Phi Island.\nEspecially during the celebration\
  \ of the New Year's Eve.\nIt was the night between the 31 December and the 1st January\
  \ of 2015 and it was my 30th birthday too. Yes, I am one of the lucky people born\
  \ at the end of the year \u2013 actually, lucky means unlucky! But, this is another\
  \ story.\nFor that special birthday, I decided to take a trip. My cousin Andrea\
  \ was a Muay Thai fighter, he had some friends in Thailand and he already visited\
  \ this incredible paradise lost. So we planned to travel through the State during\
  \ December till the end of the year, ending with a cool finish in Ko Phi Phi Island,\
  \ the reign of thai entertainment.\nI've never thought to see so many people on\
  \ a beach after the sun went down! From the sunset till the dawn (and after) a continuous,\
  \ colored, amazing party went on all over the beach, the restaurants, hotels, and\
  \ especially the people, both tourists, and residents.\nI can safely say that I've\
  \ seen all the kinds of street performers, dancers, musicians, artists, and fire-eaters,\
  \ performing themselves on that incredible night, playing with fireballs, glasses,\
  \ poles, all sorts of ukuleles, enjoying themselves and the audience. People were\
  \ crazy, drunk, filled with an infectious enthusiasm and escaped forever the ghost\
  \ of my lost youngness! \nI've danced, talked, flirted and also did yoga with a\
  \ nice without-name boy came from Mexico that I've lost after a wrong asana.  into\
  \ the breach at 4 am. Probably I also have promised fallen in love once or two that\
  \ night, with some of my casual mad dance partners. The most part of the time I\
  \ was stumbling between awe and wonder asking myself where did Andrea ended up!\
  \ Yes, he was a fighter, but he still is 4 years younger than me, so I felt a little\
  \ responsible. We both had our little apartment's keys, so we were able to come\
  \ back on our own.\nAnd, about 5 a.m. I decided to leave the party \u2013 it was\
  \ enough for me! Surprise surprise, when I entered the room I found my younger cousin\
  \ already sleeping in his bed! I can congratulate with myself- I've thought smiling\
  \ to myself! The time to lay my head on the pillow that I've fallen asleep as I\
  \ haven't slept from years. \nAfter what I thought that was approximately 15 seconds\
  \ I heard some strange noise coming from the window. I went on sleeping, but the\
  \ noise was still here. It seemed to be like a strong wind because it whistled and\
  \ shaken the apartment. I heard it on the window glass but also on the roof, in\
  \ different points. The apartment was built on the rocks, on the highest part of\
  \ the entire island, nothing behind us, and you needed to climb for getting the\
  \ door. There was a little patio, where we usually left our towels and shoes. Inside\
  \ there was a large room with two beds taped to the window and a small bathroom\
  \ with shower. No kitchen, no living room, no bedrooms: essential, almost clean\
  \ and furnished in the classical wild style made of bamboo and osier.\nThe noise\
  \ was going to be annoying. I felt Andrea moving in his bed.\u201CWhat is this?\u201D\
  \ The watch marked 7:30 am. The discomfort became immediately fury: I thought some\
  \ idiots was going on with his party here on my porch, so I stood up to end their\
  \ party.\nTwo monkeys were jumping in the patio, throwing I don't know what to each\
  \ other. Andrea! I cried. I was not frightened, I was astonished! And obviously,\
  \ my anger turned into laughs. I know the Monkey Island was close, but this stroke\
  \ of luck coming directly the true nature of the island was unthinkable. Oh gosh,\
  \ my bag! These were Andrea's words looking at the scene: our joker mates were playing\
  \ with it, probably left on the patio yesterday night.\nLooking at them I realized\
  \ that we definitely had our start with a bang for the new year."
