Text: "Going to Peru to hike the the Inca trail was a vacation that showed me the\
  \ natural wonders this Earth has to offer. The Inca trail itself was an experience\
  \ that was adventurous, yet still had some luxury. The trip was broken up into five\
  \ days, all which had intense hiking, incredible views, and good company. The hiking\
  \ itself was a cycle of exhaustion and awe. When it seemed like the hiking was getting\
  \ too tiring, we would reach a viewpoint that restored all mental and physical energy\
  \ to keep on trekking. As we hiked, our guide Abel made sure to stop and explain\
  \ the flora and history of the area. His enthusiasm and passion for this expedition\
  \ was unending throughout the whole trip. When we finished the first half of day\
  \ one and were getting ready for lunch we came across arguably the best part of\
  \ the trip: the food. I didn\u2019t expect to have a hot meal in the middle of the\
  \ jungle, but the porters and the main cook Segundino made sure we had a full course\
  \ meal three times a day. It amazed me how the cook and porters could hike all day\
  \ carrying all the luggage, arrive at camp, set up camp, and then start cooking\
  \ an excellent meal. The porters made what seemed like a rough outdoor trip extremely\
  \ luxurious.\nFor me personally, the untouched nature we experienced made hiking\
  \ more than just a walk to a destination. The constantly changing weather would\
  \ make it so when we first starting hiking there would be a thick fog that occupied\
  \ the whole valley. The fog was so thick that if you wouldn\u2019t have known if\
  \ you were walking on the edge of a cliff. As we climbed up through the valleys\
  \ and passes the blanket of clouds would start to clear out and we could finally\
  \ see where we were headed. The clouds were easily the most beautiful part of the\
  \ trip. They added so much more to the already stunning scenery and since they moved\
  \ so much, the views never got old. \nOn our fourth day of hiking our effort finally\
  \ paid off and we finally saw Machu Picchu. On the way to our final destination\
  \ we encountered a torrential downpour. Everyone in our group was worried that the\
  \ rain and fog would completely obscure the ruins leaving us with nothing but memories\
  \ and pictures of fog rather than Machu Picchu. Out of an act of the Inca Gods,\
  \ however, as soon as we reached the Sun Gate (the first place Machu Picchu can\
  \ be seen from) the sun started to creep out and we saw the ruins in all its glory.\
  \ The effort that I had put in to see the view of Machu Picchu surrounded by steep\
  \ green mountains shrouded in low hanging clouds created a sense of reverence towards\
  \ the environment around me. \nThe phrase \u201Cit\u2019s the journey not the destination\u201D\
  \ definitely applies to the Inca trail and Machu Picchu. Hiking through the jungle\
  \ for four days often made me forget what we were hiking to simply because I was\
  \ so captivated by the colors, shapes, and sounds that I was surrounded in. Not\
  \ to discount the engineering genius of Machu Picchu, but I found myself more excited\
  \ by the experiences leading up to seeing it rather than the Machu Picchu itself.\
  \ Going into the Peru trip I had no idea what to expect, however this trip was an\
  \ experience I\u2019ll never forget. From sleeping in a tent for four days straight\
  \ to eating a freshly baked cake prepared by the porters at 13,000 ft. everything\
  \ was new and memorable. Each day there was something exciting and beautiful to\
  \ see. The rainy season (December) definitely made the trip more beautiful because\
  \ you could only appreciate certain views for a few minutes before they were completely\
  \ covered in clouds. In the future I can see myself doing more of these treks and\
  \ experiencing more of the world for how it is."
