Text: "It is said to be likened to Victoria Falls on the Zambesi River between Zambia\
  \ and Zimbabwe in respect to its whiteness and the mist it emits when it's at its\
  \ fullest. Farin Ruwa which means white water in Hausa language is a waterfall in\
  \ Wamba council area of Nasarawa State in Nigeria. Having chased waterfalls in Nigeria,\
  \ my country, I put Farin Ruwa on the list of my next hike. \nResearching my destination\
  \ and mapping out a list of what to do is always top of my to-do list whenever I\
  \ am embarking on a trip. I had read up about Farin Ruwa but I discovered there\
  \ was not enough information out there that can educate people about the place,\
  \ thus my curiosity to visit and write my own story.\nThere are little villages\
  \ on the way such as Mama, Marhai, Kulere and Wamba, the terrain to the waterfall\
  \ gets dusty and challenging as you go further in. Your real journey starts when\
  \ you cross the first stream which is the most active of all the streams that you\
  \ will have to cross to get to the Waterfall. About 15km from the fall, you will\
  \ witness a wonderful view of the fall as it flows against the large flat chested\
  \ rocky terrain. It gives you an illusion of been closer to the waterfall, but alas,\
  \ your journey has just started. \nThe first bridge is built with concrete slabs\
  \ and is quite strong. It can take bikes but not wide enough for cars. The climb\
  \ up and down the hill starts. I tried to compare this terrain to the one of Owu\
  \ waterfall in terms of the challenges faced in getting to them. They both seem\
  \ to be the farthest into the hinterland so far for me in terms of roughness. We\
  \ passed six streams before getting to the waterfall. There are some rocks that\
  \ were laid in the streams for people to walk on making a rocky pathway exception\
  \ of the first one with a bridge. I did walk through the rivers for I was wearing\
  \ plastic shoes. Advisable when hiking where water is, get good crocs with good\
  \ grip soles.\n\nOn your way, about 5km to the fall one would notice some abandoned\
  \ uncompleted buildings on the far left. I later learn from the tour guide, Mr Emmanuel\
  \ Agalti, a staff of the Tourism Ministry that they were supposed to be chalets\
  \ for guests to stay in. But like the sad story of all the Tourism spots we have,\
  \ it's an abandoned project.\n\nI met the guide on the way as we were about to cross\
  \ the first stream. He lives in one of the villages we passed on the way, and once\
  \ we were spotted as strangers, he heads out to meet us.\nAt some point, I will\
  \ come down from the bike, walk a few distances and then climb back again, drive\
  \ some few metres and down again. On getting to the last bridge which is an iron\
  \ bridge, we parked the bike and then walk into a spaced forest with trees left\
  \ and right forming an umbrella above. From here you will start hearing the sound\
  \ of the water, you have to keep walking and then you see some stairs that lead\
  \ down to the fall. The first close sight of the fall is amazing.\nIn October, it\
  \ is not at its fullest but one can see and feel the force of the water. Surrounding\
  \ and leading to the waterfall are high range hills.\n\n\"Farin Ruwa was discovered\
  \ during the reign of Abdullahi Adamu, a once civilian governor in 1999. The source\
  \ of the fall is in Plateau State. On the other side of the hill is Plateau State.\
  \ \nNasarawa was created on October 1st, 1996, it was split from Plateau State.\
  \ If you have been you Kurra or Assop falls in Plateau State, you will notice the\
  \ same rock structures, formations, patterns and colours with Farin Ruwa.\nFarin\
  \ Ruwa was indeed worth the effort of chasing, moving through seven streams, passing\
  \ through tough terrain was indeed worth it."
