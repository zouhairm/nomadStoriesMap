Text: "It was no secret that  I was moping around Pittsburgh, comparing everything\
  \ in Pittsburgh unfavorably to Porto.  They have prettier bridges!  They have beautiful\
  \ vineyards along the river valley and we have \u2026..waterparks and abandoned\
  \ steel mills. Where can you buy decent Olive Oil in this town?  In hindsight, my\
  \ post-Fulbright behavior was pretty obnoxious, and I think that there was a collective\
  \ sigh of relief among my family and friends when I was asked to a conference in\
  \ Porto:  \u201Cmaybe now she will shut-up about it\u201D I am sure was their response\
  \ to plans to return.\n\nI must admit that Portugal took on a sheen of perfection\
  \ when I returned home.   In my recollections I forgot about how lonely I was, particularly\
  \ in the early weeks, and how Alan Carr and Australian Master Chef became my therapeutic\
  \ interventions to treat homesickness.  Memory is rarely accurate or emotionally\
  \ faithful. But in my homesickness for a place that was not really my home, the\
  \ cats of Paranhos played a major role.\n\nI had been walking to the University,\
  \ thinking about the lonely day ahead and then I heard\u201C MERROW\u201D .  \n\
  \ Where was that sound coming from?  Porto, like any major city has a sizable population\
  \ of feral cats living on the streets.  The Portuguese treat these cats humanely,\
  \ co-sharing space with them although both Portuguese and the cats were losing space\
  \ weekly due to the building boom in Porto.\n\u201CMERROW .\nI looked above me and\
  \ on the top of the wall, a black cat with olive green eyes was staring down at\
  \ me as if waiting for something.  \u201CSo, are you the spokes cat\u201D I asked\
  \ although I\u2019m not sure if he understood English. But he did understand tuna\
  \ and cat food which I carried in my backpack.  He was joined by a petite tortoiseshell\
  \ cat, a female, shortly after the tuna was offered.  \u201CSpokesy\u201D and \u201C\
  tortie\u201D became part of my daily routine.  After breakfast, I would visit the\
  \ parking lot next to the abandoned house which is where they seemed to live.  Spoksey\
  \ was always waiting for me (and tuna), usually joined by his sister.  Knowing that\
  \ they were waiting for me gave me a routine, a purpose outside of the academy,\
  \ and a little friend circle, albeit a  furry one.  Shortly after meeting them,\
  \ I discovered their caretaker, an elderly gentleman with a dog.  I named him Senhor\
  \ Cao because I never could understand his accent well enough to discover his real\
  \ name.  But like clockwork, he could be seen walking down the street,  bags of\
  \ cat food one hand, an umbrella in the other, trailed by his elderly dog.  We would\
  \ converse, but I never fully understood him.  He called me Professora Americana\
  \ and he knew that I loved his cats.  That was our common language.\n\nWhen I returned\
  \ to Porto, the first thing that I did after landing was to go to the location of\
  \ Spokesy and tortie. As I emerged from the metro, my heart sunk.  In the place\
  \ of the abandoned lot was a building under construction, with a tremendous amount\
  \ of noise.  In a city like Porto, with a booming tourism industry, and in a University\
  \ area, every bit of space is needed for housing, parking and space for classrooms.\
  \  But this was the cats place --their HOME.  How could they have survived this?\
  \  I tried to maneuver around the building site but it was impossible, and then\
  \ to my utter joy, I saw Senhor Cao!  I never fully understood the phrase \u201C\
  time stood still\u201D until the moment of seeing him, with umbrella and cat food\
  \ in hand, walking towards me, the dog limping next to him.  Clearly time had passed--\
  \ there was a new building where a parking lot and an abandoned house once stood\u2014\
  but seeing  them felt miraculous at that moment.\n\u201CWhere are the cats Senhor?\
  \  Are they still alive\u201D?  \n\u201CYes, Sra Americana, follow me\u201D\nThere\
  \ inside the building site (which he navigated with ease), he showed me that there\
  \ was still a place for the cats and their feeding station.  Like clockwork, Spoksey\
  \ arrived at the scene.  \u201CMERROW\u201D .  Thankfully, I had tuna in my carry-on."
