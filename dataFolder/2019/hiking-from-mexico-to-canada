Text: "I first heard of the Pacific Crest Trail in 2012, when I met a Triple Crown\
  \ hiker. (She completed the three major US long distance hikes). I was fresh out\
  \ of college, and managed to score a seasonal job in Juneau that involved working\
  \ with sled dogs on a remote ice field. The hiker was my coworker. At that point,\
  \ I didn\u2019t know what thru-hiking was, and the idea of walking thousands of\
  \ miles sounded insane.\n\nIt also sounded extremely intriguing. Her stories of\
  \ the PCT resonated with me the most. After that summer, I got a job as a dog trainer\
  \ for a major pet store chain back home. I started putting away money and doing\
  \ occasional trail research, but I never intended to go through with the idea.\n\
  \nI did, however, start hiking with friends more, and collecting backpacking gear.\
  \ It was nothing serious, and I didn\u2019t go on my first backpacking trip until\
  \ I visited Maui in 2014. About a year after that trip, there were some policy and\
  \ management changes at work that made it clear it was time for me to move on. \n\
  \nMy mom woke up early on April 21st, 2015 to drive me to the airport. The plane\
  \ ride from the Seattle to San Diego is pretty short, maybe about an hour or two,\
  \ and it was during this time reality hit me. I didn\u2019t panic too much, but\
  \ I was definitely second guessing myself. I was suddenly thinking, \u201CAm I really\
  \ doing this?\u201D\n\nAfter I arrived in San Diego, there was no one to drive me\
  \ to the border. Instead, I took public transportation. I had read that there were\
  \ trail angels who would help me, but at that point I wasn\u2019t comfortable asking\
  \ for help when I could do something myself. So I took a bus, and then a trolley,\
  \ and then another bus.\n\nOn that final bus I met my first thru-hikers. We talked\
  \ about gear and our PCT plans on the bus ride. It was fun, and it helped me calm\
  \ down. The bus dropped us off about a mile from the Mexican Border. We filled up\
  \ on water at the local Fire Station, and made or way to the terminus together.\
  \ I left the border thinking that maybe I really could hike to Canada.\n\nI did."
