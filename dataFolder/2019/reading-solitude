Text: "There\u2019s always a time in life wherein you want to cut down from everything\
  \ and find your self worth.I didn\u2019t expect to find my solitude in The Netherlands.\
  \                   Leiden was the place where I stayed and just writing the word\
  \ itself brings a huge smile and whole lot of nostalgia. Being a historical and\
  \ a canal town, the place is quiet and blissful altogether. A windmill at the backdrop,serene\
  \ canals all round and centuries old architectural wonders are the primary sights\
  \ you will find. The smell of freshly baked stroopwaffles and a walk around De Valk\
  \ makes you all pumped up for the day!                                         \
  \          Ever smiling strangers who greet you every day made me wonder that life\
  \ is short and we must enjoy every moment! I understood how much value the people\
  \ of Netherlands give to their family that it is a ritual to sit down together for\
  \ dinner and share your everyday musings. Health is another factor for which dutch\
  \ are serious about and you would see people jogging even at night! There is a Saturday\
  \ market where all of ys used to buy our weekly fresh supplies directly from the\
  \ farmers. They being generous enough to give us cheese tasters with a big grin!\
  \ Travelling do teaches us how to take care of ourselves and be more vigilant! One\
  \ must never miss a sunset at Scheveningen beach. Apart from beaches, there is the\
  \ world famous Amsterdam for all the cannabis lover and adventure freaks! Amsterdam\
  \ is the home for heineken and there is a musuem dedicated to Beer. How cool is\
  \ that!  I was lucky enough to spend my first ever cold winter Christmas at Leiden.\
  \ There were makeshift shops on the ice rink itself with giggles and skates all\
  \ around. There were churches holding their xmas mass and  those left me awestruck.\
  \   Travelling to Leiden has given me a feeling that happiness which I will cherish\
  \ forever!"
