Text: "It was a cold morning and I looked out through my windows to find the beautiful\
  \ nostalgic domes of the historical site next street. They reminded me of the igloo\
  \ houses on the snow but differed having four windows and grasses growing on them...\n\
  \nKayseri is a beautiful city in the Central Anatolia in Turkey. I was there for\
  \ a week to participate in the International symposium on Ecology at Erciyes University.\
  \ The Erciyes mountain gifted a breathtaking moment every morning when we embarked\
  \ on our journey to the University. However, it wasn't a witness to my beautiful\
  \ nights. I found Turkey very cold but people were very warm and loving. Indeed,\
  \ I was a bit hesitant to interact with the locals because of my preconceived notions\
  \ about the country. \n\nI was driven by an unknown force in that morning to take\
  \ a walk in the lesser known streets. I grabbed my fleece and put on my hunter boots,\
  \ the valuables of a minimalist. It was so early that very few people were on the\
  \ street opening their shops. I  moved to the interiors of city where the gullies\
  \ looked like as that of Delhi but cleaner. I was able to locate the old building\
  \ with the domes which I was fancying about almost everyday. The entrance had two\
  \ old vine tree with gorgeous trunks and mature leaves. It felt medieval and so\
  \ capturing once I was inside the building! It had corners wherein the history of\
  \ Turkey was told in pictures, stalls of traditional rugs and carpets and artefacts.\
  \ I realized it was to early for the museum to be open and had to leave with a heavy\
  \ heart. But as soon as I  got outside, I got to see three shopkeepers cleaning\
  \ the street and sipping on Turkish tea and bread. I was truly a bit afraid considering\
  \ the remote area and how isolated it was. I wanted to take a photo of the area\
  \ and as I proceeded, the old man among them called me towards him. I went ahead\
  \ and in their broken English they learned that I am from Hind (India). It was wonderful\
  \ what happened next. This man asked me to sit with him, offered a fresh cup of\
  \ tea and bread. It was when I struggled to munch on the dry bread without the help\
  \ of a curry, he removed his fleece and put it on me, saying 'it is cold outside,\
  \ you are not wearing proper clothing!'. I was so flabbergasted and grateful at\
  \ his thoughtful act. I asked the second man to take a picture of the old man and\
  \ me. It came as a shock to me, an Indian when the man kissed on my cheeks as a\
  \ traditional Turkish practice. I was surely not expecting that! \n\n\nToday, I\
  \ realize that what that man did was an amazing act of kindness. It taught me lessons\
  \ of empathizing with people and being kind always. I am a young woman today more\
  \ grateful for the blessings life offered to me. I want to keep spreading love and\
  \ have a heart with no biases towards a country or a community. Its just not that\
  \ he fed me ,clothed me and hugged me, became a good Samaritan. He became an alchemist\
  \ on the my journey of life!"
