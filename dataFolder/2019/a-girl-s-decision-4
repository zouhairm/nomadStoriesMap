Text: "Have you ever found yourself in a very difficult situation without knowing\
  \ what choice should you make? \nIn a situation that you must sacrifice something\
  \ but you are not sure whether you should follow your brain or your heart?\nIf the\
  \ answer is yes, you may find interesting the following story about a decision that\
  \ would change a girl\u2019s life for good.  \n\n\u201CI come from a small European\
  \ country characterized as \xAB \u0391 jewel of the Mediterranean Sea\xBB. Cyprus,\
  \ the island where Greek goddess Aphrodite was born.\nIf you asked me about myself,\
  \ I would describe me as a shy introverted girl. \nNot really the adventurous one.I\
  \ can\u2019t really remember myself traveling a lot as a child. \nIn fact, I don\u2019\
  t remember myself traveling at all. \nMy only travel experience must have been when\
  \ I was about three years old with my parents to our neighbor country, Greece. That\u2019\
  s all.\n\nI always wanted to travel abroad but never really had the chance. So you\
  \ can imagine my excitement, when I learned one day from a professor about some\
  \ projects of European Union that gives the opportunity to young people like me\
  \ to travel abroad. \nAs soon as I found out about these projects, I started searching\
  \ for more information and applying in every single one that was available. \nSuddenly,\
  \ a whole new world opened to me. A world so usual and fascinating at the same time\
  \ that I definitely wanted to explore.  \n\nAfter a long period of waiting and getting\
  \ quite disappointed from all the rejections, I finally saw that email that would\
  \ made a dream of mine come true. I was accepted to a project in Croatia! I couldn\u2019\
  t describe how happy and excited I was.  \nBut just like fairy-tales my happiness\
  \ was about to end soon\u2026It only took one moment for my dream to collapse. \n\
  \n\u201CSilly me!\u201D I cried. \u201CWhy did I ever believed that I had a chance?\u201D\
  \n\nMy parents wouldn\u2019t let me go. They were so overprotecting with their little\
  \ girl and completely against the idea that she would travel alone. My boyfriend\
  \ had also threatened me that he would broke up with me if I choose to go.\n \n\
  I was so depressed during the next days. That must have made my parents\u2019 heart\
  \ melt and made them reconsider their decision. So when, I got their approval, I\
  \ started to prepare everything for the trip. \nTo be honest, I didn\u2019t really\
  \ mind to break up with my boyfriend. I mean why should I even be with someone who\
  \ is not supporting me? \nBut suddenly it hit me!\nI realized that I would be all\
  \ by myself for two whole days in two completely strange for me countries! First,\
  \ I would have to stay at Vienna for a day because there was no direct flight from\
  \ Cyprus to Croatia. Then, I would have to wait for my other flight from Vienna\
  \ to Croatia\u2019s capital, Zagreb that was early in the morning and finally, I\
  \ would have to spend the night at Zagreb and take the bus at the following morning\
  \ to get to the meeting point with the other participants, at Split. \n\nMy second\
  \ thoughts about the travel lead me to a huge dilemma and I didn't know if I should\
  \ follow my brain and stay or if I should follow my heart and go.\nBut that was\
  \ my dream! \nWhy give up my chance to travel?\"\n\nIn case you are wondering, that\
  \ girl is me. That was the story about my leap into the unknown.\nAs I see things\
  \ now, I am sure that I made the right choice back then.  Sometimes, it really worth\
  \ to follow our heart and take that leap. It\u2019s never easy but you have a lot\
  \ to learn from that. When I returned home, I was not that shy and scared girl anymore.\
  \ \nDuring that trip, I took some of the most valuable lessons. I learned to push\
  \ my limits, trust myself and not to be afraid to reach my goals. Since then, I\
  \ have traveled six more times and seen places that I couldn\u2019t even imagine\
  \ how beautiful they are.\nAnd all happened because of that leap."
