Text: "The airport in Corfu was tinier than we had expected.Some areas were marked\
  \ off for construction. There wasn't the smell of coffee lingering in the air, the\
  \ rush of people trying to make it before the gates closed and the food court was\
  \ not open. It looked more like a coach station than an airport. Olerato and I did\
  \ not say it out loud, but our expectations had plummeted. I wish someone had said\
  \ to us at that moment- do not judge a city by its airport because the beauty we\
  \ later discovered was not only in the scenic environment but also in the hearts\
  \ of the people.\n\nWalking carefully the next morning trying to find the bus stop\
  \ for buses going into the city, we were intrigued by the simplicity of the houses\
  \ in the neighborhood. They reminded me of our home in Botswana- peach painted houses\
  \ with galvanized iron rooftops, a line of different houses in no ordered pattern\
  \ whatsoever. If its anything like my country, then it must be a reflection to some\
  \ extent of the differences in architectural taste and the size of the pockets of\
  \ every home owner, I thought to myself as my friend and I were trying to acclimatize\
  \ to this new place.\n\nWe made our way into the main road and that\u2019s when\
  \ the magic began. People were looking out of their cars at us, waves, smiles, hellos\
  \ and wows. All this attention! -What is happening?, I wondered to myself. The bus\
  \ did not have many people. There was an air of calmness, serenity. It was something\
  \ I had never experienced before. A lady got into the bus a few stops after we had\
  \ got on and she came and stood next to us. Before we knew It, she was already telling\
  \ us how she had spent all her money in Paris when she was younger, and she was\
  \ already inviting us to her home to make Souvlaki's- the Greek equivalent of a\
  \ sandwich.There was something welcoming in the people\u2019s silent acknowledgement\
  \ and on their faces. \n\nWe spent that entire day walking around Corfu mall, intrigued\
  \ by the small colorful shops, the laughter reverberating around and the music-there\
  \ was just music everywhere. Everything about it was engulfing, welcoming and yet\
  \ so foreign. Olerato and I took more than 500 pictures that day. We were trying\
  \ to capture every angle of the sea, every statue, every food outlet we wanted to\
  \ capture it so much we were always torn between reveling in it and capturing it\
  \ so that it can always be there.\n\nBeing a black person in Europe comes with its\
  \ own unique challenges.I noticed this when i first moved to the UK. Somehow you\
  \ feel you are invisible or that you are unwanted .This, I have realized, tends\
  \ to eat at a person's self esteem. I went to Corfu not expecting anything less\
  \ than the cold stares, the smiles that always appear forced and an existence which\
  \ seems to go unnoticed. In that island however,I found the fire that ignited self-love\
  \ and appreciation. The turquoise waters and the pebbles under my feet, the sound\
  \ of water waves as they made their way to the surface-it was like with every single\
  \ sweeping over my foot, all the negativity within was dissipating with the current.\
  \ I looked around me at the distant mountains, the wide expanse of water, the empty\
  \ beaches and I tried to breathe it all in and I remember thinking to myself- 'this\
  \ is what it must feel like to be alive'. For the first time in a long time I felt\
  \ an inexplicable surge of joy. This is not to say that I  wasn't aware that I was\
  \ different, no, I did, but this time my difference felt like something I can own\
  \ proudly, something that made me belong.The  people of Corfu had taken a keen interest\
  \ in wanting to know my story and  that made me feel alive.I was excited to go to\
  \ Corfu, but I did not expect to find the beauty in who I  was in a place far from\
  \ home."
