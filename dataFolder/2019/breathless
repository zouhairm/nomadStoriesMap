Text: "\u2018Wow\u2026 It\u2019s like being high,' the dreadlocked German girl gasped\
  \ after her head broke the surface of the water. Andrew, our dark-haired, clean-cut\
  \ instructor, laughed and agreed.\n\nI was definitely not feeling any kind of high.\n\
  \nBobbing a few meters away in the gentle sea, holding lightly onto the floating\
  \ rope that joined the buoys, I was trying to breathe quietly and deeply, trying\
  \ to trick my body into thinking I was relaxed, that this was easy, this was fine.\
  \ Slow deep breaths, slow heart rate. When it was my turn again I would breathe\
  \ in, filling my lungs from the bottom of my stomach to the top of my chest, and\
  \ dive downwards, following the rope until I reached the metal plate 12 metres down.\n\
  \nI\u2019d seen several freediving schools advertised as I\u2019d meandered from\
  \ island to island in Indonesia. Freediving is diving with no extra gear to help\
  \ you breathe. The courses had all promising the feeling of flying underwater, of\
  \ being part of the silent blue world unencumbered by heavy, bubbling scuba equipment.\
  \ I'd been entranced by these promises, had imagined undulating through the sunlit\
  \ depths in a state of blissful transcendence. Perhaps a school of rainbow fish\
  \ would swirl around me, probably a whale would slide by. Basically, I would be\
  \ a mermaid.\n\nMy mermaid visions had dissipated like sea foam as soon as I was\
  \ in the ocean. From out in the centre of the bay we could see the smoking cone\
  \ of Mount Agung, the active volcano that looms over the drowsy seaside village\
  \ of Amed on Bali\u2019s north-eastern coast. The volcano's flanks level off into\
  \ gentle, vividly green fields at its base, but the sea floor echoes the steep volcanic\
  \ slope. We weren\u2019t far from the shore when, despite the clarity of the water,\
  \ all I could see beneath me was a haze of sun-streaked blue.\n\n\u2018How deep\
  \ is it here?\u2019 I asked Andrew. \u2018Have you been down to the bottom?\u2019\
  \n\u2018Oh yeah, it\u2019s only about 50 metres down,\u2019 he replied cheerfully.\
  \ \n\nOnly. Sure. \n\nAndrew had talked us through how freediving works in his deep,\
  \ soothing voice. He'd explained how humans can dive down to depths of over a hundred\
  \ metres, how a deep breath can hold enough oxygen to keep your body pulsing for\
  \ the minutes you're submerged in the ocean. That tight, uncomfortable feeling in\
  \ your chest that makes you desperate to breathe is just your body\u2019s urge to\
  \ exhale carbon dioxide. Freediving is far more mental than it is physical. Your\
  \ body can do it, but whether your mind believes that is another story.\n\nMy mind\
  \ was completely unconvinced. I'd done my breathe-up, the three slow, deep breaths\
  \ to fill my lungs with oxygen, and dived under. But when I tried to use the rope\
  \ to pull myself, head downwards, towards the weighted plate, I just panicked. I\
  \ couldn't equalise to relieve the building pressure in my ears, and I couldn\u2019\
  t breathe to relieve the swelling tightness in my chest. I spun and shot upwards\
  \ to the surface and gulped in air. \n\n\u2018Just go down right way up,\u2019 Andrew\
  \ told me imperturbably. \u2018And close your eyes, you\u2019ll find it easier.\u2019\
  \n\nThe other two girls in my group went down easily, all the way to the end of\
  \ the rope. Damned mermaids. When it was my turn again, I did as Andrew said. Right\
  \ way up this time, I slipped under the water and started to slither down the rope.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019m so calm, I told myself. No need to breathe. Oh god I have to breathe.\
  \ Nope, so calm. Down the rope. Equalise. And down. Very calm. I am one with the\
  \ ocean. Where the hell is this plate? Need to go faster. No. Calm and slow. \n\n\
  I opened my eyes as my feet touched the plate and released the rope. I looked up\
  \ at the surface, 12 metres above me. Ignoring the pressure in my chest, I floated\
  \ up gently through the blue-lit water. My body could do it. I was so calm, and\
  \ it was so quiet. Actually, I almost felt a bit high."
