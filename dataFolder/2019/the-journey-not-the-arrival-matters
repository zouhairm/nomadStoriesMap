Text: "A perfect weather for a perfect adventure, gazing at the beauty of mother nature,\
  \ as the sun rays strike on my window,ready to embark on our journey, our bags already\
  \ packed just like our minds where filled with excitiment,Finally this day has come\
  \ ,reaching to the unknown curiosity,excitement,that urge felt like trying to find\
  \ a treasure.Our travel was heading to Cape town,We could not even take sight away\
  \ from the places that were so mind refreshing it was the power of visual appeal,\
  \ the beautiful places and the extraordinary spots .When we checked in to our hotel\
  \ we didn't even stay for a micro minute we were already rushing to see the scenic\
  \ places, on our way out we saw how people everywhere want authentic experiences\
  \ , the first place we went to was the Seapoint Promenade a very good place for\
  \ sundowner hangouts , our camera couldn't be kept away from our hands it was more\
  \ like a new born baby, this place was perfect for sunset views, we were already\
  \ starving so we went for lunch at One Huisie, a little fish and chips restaurant\
  \ right next to the beach on stadler road, and nothing beats the across sea looking\
  \ at the flattop of Table Mountain view just after our feast we went to Chapman's\
  \ peak drive one of the world\u2019s best known nine kilometres of cliff-hugging\
  \ road and 114 bends and we discovered it was where the Mercedes Benz and BMW filmed\
  \ their adverts what was more fascinating was that those cars are one of our favourites\
  \ to cool off. We went to Noordhoek one of the jaw dropping sceneries we had seen\
  \ other exceptional views around the corner as we went back to our room, we were\
  \ ready for yet another day to explore all the places because we had only three\
  \ days to enjoy our delightful moment, The Cape is dotted with all the charming\
  \ places to visit its filled character rich small towns and villages waiting to\
  \ be uncovered,towns brimming with history-rich character, quaint guesthouses, and\
  \ interesting places to eat. Our finally day came it was really hard to leave but\
  \ we had the most amazing time, discovering history,the beauty of nature and mostly\
  \ a leap of the unknown."
