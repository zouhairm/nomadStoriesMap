Text: "It was a day I was waiting for half a year. I\u2019ve arrived to Taiwan! \n\
  Before from the internet, I\u2019ve seen pictures of temples, Chan Kai Shek square,\
  \ monuments etc. However, as they say \u2018Better once to see, than 100 times to\
  \ hear\u2019. So, I arrived to Taoyuan international airport, it was cute, clean.\
  \ I saw many charges for telephones (iPhone, Samsung etc.) for peoples\u2019 convenience.\
  \ In our country they would be stolen \uF04A People were so polite and peaceful.\
  \ Then we took a car to Taipei. I was surprised to see beautiful modern buildings\
  \ along with ancient historical temples. They manage to combine their deep history\
  \ with modernity & innovation. I didn\u2019t expect to see such great university\
  \ campuses; interesting building; nice buses, train stations etc.\nThey are hard\
  \ and smart working people. They produce laptops like Acer, Asus; smartphones HTC.\
  \ Foxconn is Taiwan based company.  \nWhen I went to a caf\xE9, I\u2019ve seen people\
  \ sitting there and reading a book, a newspaper, or students studying their subjects,\
  \ doing homework/projects. Whole families come and everyone is reading something.\
  \ So classy. When I passed by a library at 8.55am (which opens at 9.00am) there\
  \ was a queue! They were waiting a library to open, as if reading was their whole\
  \ life. Moreover, they\u2019d feel so shy when they cannot speak English well. Just\
  \ knowing their language, is like knowing 6000 characters. So hard language. I loved\
  \ their society in general. \nI\u2019ve stayed in Tainan city for two years. It\u2019\
  s a city full of temples, like in every street. People are more religious and simple\
  \ than in Taipei. Once, in the morning, like 6am, I was on my balcony, and saw a\
  \ woman praying for a statue at the entry to temple. She prayed for a good working\
  \ day I guess. She put some pineapples and tea in front it. Then she sat to her\
  \ motorcycle and went to work. During the day nobody touched that food, in the evening\
  \ she came and took it away. It was weird for me, but then I thought, maybe she\
  \ is feeding the statue symbolically and showing her respect in such way\u2026\n\
  One day, I was passing by this temple, there was a black iron bin near it, I thought\
  \ it\u2019s a garbage bin and threw my garbage there. Then a man came out and started\
  \ to be little bit angry to me, I couldn\u2019t understand him. Apparently, it was\
  \ sacred bin where they burn sacred papers (with sacred words). Culture shock happens,\
  \ then you have just sweet memories of it. \nAnother day, I was crossing the road\
  \ when two motorcycles crashed into each other. One of the drivers hurt his arm.\
  \ Two drivers hugged each other, sat on sideway and started to soothe each other\
  \ while waiting for ambulance. I didn\u2019t expect them to behave in such way!\
  \ I thought they\u2019d yell and even have fight.\nIn the shops, supermarkets, salesman\
  \ would bow to you, show his respect to a customer. I love this tradition to bow\
  \ to each other. So unique and special. When I went to a shopping mall and needed\
  \ to use elevator, I saw a pretty young lady inside it. I came in, she asked, which\
  \ floor I needed to go, then she pressed the button. When we arrived to that floor,\
  \ I went out and she slowly bowed to me, thanked me. It was her job \uF04A amazing.\
  \ \nAnother topic is food\u2026 so many new things. I\u2019ve tried snake soup,\
  \ fried octopus, some seafood (I don\u2019t know even the names) salad with bamboo\
  \ etc. of course, I had diarrhea later, but had interesting experience \uF04A the\
  \ smell is also weird but after some time you get used to it. They live lots of\
  \ rice and seafood, thus live long and healthy. And you have to learn eating with\
  \ chopsticks. In most cafe there are no spoons, forks.\nI didn\u2019t expect to\
  \ see drunk people outside, and I didn\u2019t! I didn\u2019t expect to see angry\
  \ and aggressive people, and I didn\u2019t! All these whole two years. I\u2019ve\
  \ made so good friends there, I miss them. I fell in love with Taiwan."
