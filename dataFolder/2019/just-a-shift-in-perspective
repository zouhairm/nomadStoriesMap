Text: "Never have I thought that I would go to Taiwan. In Asia, best places to visit\
  \ on my list are Korea and Japan. It started when my friend asked me to join a student\
  \ exchange program this year. One big question popped up on my mind when I knew\
  \ I was accepted in this two weeks program. \u201CWhat could be enjoyed in Taiwan?\u201D\
  \ The award of best street food goes to Korea. The award of home to numerous different\
  \ ethnic groups, languages, and religions goes to Indonesia. The award of various\
  \ traditional arts (including tea ceremonies, calligraphy, and flower arranging)\
  \ goes to Japan. Therefore, I didn\u2019t have any high expectation that I would\
  \ be excited to stay in Taiwan. Long story short, I landed in Kaoh Siung International\
  \ Airport then it took an hour to arrive in Tainan, the former capital city of Taiwan.\n\
  \nAn-Ping Tree House is one of the local famous attractions. It used to be a warehouse\
  \ for Japan Salt Company built for almost ten years by Qing government. Then, it\
  \ was abandoned causing the banyan three around it started to spread its branches\
  \ and roots around the building. That\u2019s an essential point I could clearly\
  \ remember from what the local tour guide said. So it\u2019s basically a quite large\
  \ unoccupied house with huge roots and branches around which is open for public\
  \ as a tourist spot. Not impressed enough, I decided to roam inside hoping I could\
  \ find something that caught the eyes. Enormous ice cream shop brightened my gloomy\
  \ day! I couldn\u2019t believe there was one inside a tree house. In the level two\
  \ of the building, there\u2019s a small library making the tourists engrossed in\
  \ reading while enjoying the cold breeze as it\u2019s on the rooftop. On the corner\
  \ of the room, a thousand of hand-crafted accessories were displayed. Each of them\
  \ tells a different story.\n\nLocating on Hai\u2019an Road, north district of Tainan\
  \ City, Garden Night Market opens at 7pm. The unique thing about this place is it\
  \ only opens three days a week \u2013 on Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday. When I\
  \ first arrived, I couldn\u2019t resist the temptation to try all the food since\
  \ the smell was mouth-watering. It was so crowded that I needed to put my bag in\
  \ front to reduce the possibility of pick-pocketing. From the first aisle, I bought\
  \ oyster omelet and sticky tofu. Oh my God, I would definitely be willing to eat\
  \ these two for the rest of my life; too good to be true. The oyster didn\u2019\
  t stink and the tofu was soft. I\u2019m not sure why the tofu is called \u2018sticky\
  \ tofu\u2019 but the ones I ate weren\u2019t sticky at all. On the second aisle,\
  \ I spent my money on candied guava and spicy duck blood. The only reason why I\
  \ wanted to try duck blood was because I heard that long time ago it was consumed\
  \ by a poor man who lived in a suburb of China then it brought luck to him and his\
  \ entire family because two months later he became a billionaire out of sudden.\
  \ Ever since, Chinese people have put duck blood soup in the menu mixing it with\
  \ vermicelli. I know it sounds too superstitious but why don\u2019t you give it\
  \ a try? Nobody knows what the future holds so give it a shot. Last but not least,\
  \ I sipped Taiwan\u2019s special bubble tea.\n \nApparently 14 days aren\u2019t\
  \ enough to explore Tainan yet it has already succeeded to make me feel like home.\
  \ There are a lot of things to learn. I keep in mind all the good stuffs so that\
  \ I can reminisce them once I start to miss Tainan. I love how the locals are so\
  \ friendly that they wouldn\u2019t mind greeting every stranger they meet and I\
  \ remember how they grinned from ear to ear when I tried to speak their language.\
  \ The cleanliness of the city is 10/10. I won\u2019t forget how the weather put\
  \ me into a good night\u2019s sleep during my stay. In a nutshell, I can say that\
  \ Tainan is where my heart belongs. See you in the near future, dear Tainan."
