Text: "Two unpredictable sophomores like Amira and I have been thumbed up by some\
  \ of our friends due to our flocation of June 2018 which took place in Yogyakarta\
  \ city, Indonesia without needed a lot of planning but capital of determination\
  \ and well-managed finances to vent our fatigue third semester' soul emotions. Indeed,\
  \ since in the beginning of holding the title of freshmen, we have initiated to\
  \ explore this historical and magical, 'The Student City'.\nThat was not just about\
  \ imagining, but realizationing.\n\nLet me ride you in!\n\nPrecisely the fourth\
  \ day has sedated us to the culture by visiting Taman Sari Water Castle located\
  \ on Jalan Taman. We arrived at the tourist site at half past two in the afternoon\
  \ western Indonesia time. We were in a hurry to explore this one-hectare area because\
  \ it closed at three o'clock.\n\nTaman Sari Water Castle was a site of a former\
  \ garden inherited from the era of Sultan Hamengkubuwono I, as the leader of the\
  \ Yogyakarta regional empire, in the period of 1758 to 1765. Simply by paying an\
  \ entrance ticket of five thousand rupiahs, we could feel its historical greeting.\
  \ The visitors were welcomed by a pool which was been a bathing place for Sultan's\
  \ (a call of Moeslem\u2019s king empire) concubines and grand old architecture denominated\
  \ by Hindu-Buddhism culture by the hands of a Portuguese.\nShortly after we took\
  \ a look at the splendor of the site, a friendly old tour guide came along while\
  \ started to explaining the site\u2019s information until the end of our trip.\n\
  Once, we were ushered into a room which was known as the bedroom of Nyai Roro Kidul,\
  \ the queen of the south coast of the Java sea and believed to protect the site.\
  \ An open-room without doors allowed the air circulation freely. For the time being,\
  \ the doors are saved to avoid from damage or the thefts, and some are even auctioned,\
  \ as informed by the guide. Stepping my feet unto where the door frame located,\
  \ being smelled a fragrance which loosened the brain nerves for a moment.\n\nThe\
  \ flowers aroma!\n\nThe situation of this room was very different from the others.\
  \ How strange! How could an open-room without doors had a very bold flowery aroma?\
  \ During our guide explaining, I found Amira, throwing her eyes at me also summing\
  \ up a sweet smile. I was sure she also relished it.\n\nThis high curiosity delivered\
  \ my feet to find the source of the fragrance. What did I find? There was no air\
  \ freshener, flower, or anything as an excuse to make this room smelled good! So\
  \ magical! I kept locking my mind hoping to get additional information about the\
  \ fragrance. However, there was no concern about that.\n\nFurthermore, we continued\
  \ the journey to a room that was considered as a kitchen where a century old well\
  \ placed and believed to never out of water stock. The water is used as a medium\
  \ for cleaning the sacred Keris (a type of dagger for warfare, a complementary object,\
  \ or jewelry) back, belonging to the Yogyakarta palace on a first Suro night so\
  \ that the Keris keeps sticking on its place. Keris is believed to have a spirit\
  \ that can move it. If the Keris is not cleaned at that time, the peoples believed\
  \ that there would be a big disaster for the palace and so would the entire Yogyakarta\
  \ area, such as a natural disaster.\n\nAs soon as we went out from there, Amira\
  \ questioned that had been held back before, about the fragrance in the bedroom\
  \ of  Nyai Roro Kidul. \"Oh, the fragrance came from that room? There is something\
  \ who \u2018guards', known as the disciple of Nyai. All who guard this palace, including\
  \ that room, are all women. The fragrance came from them. Cantilever aroma. The\
  \ fragrance signifies they are present. They are good if we don't do something bad\"\
  , the guide informed.\n\nIt didn't take minutes or seconds, I immediately ambushed\
  \ Amira's pupils who spoke a lot in just a matter of time.\n\nThe not a dime a dozen!"
