Text: "There are times where life throws unexpected adventures at you, other times\
  \ where you have a plan to be somewhere, start somewhere and find yourself somewhere\
  \ completely different. In 2013 life took me and to how I felt then, threw me in\
  \ Northern Cyprus for the next 4 years of my life. It was that first moment I arrived\
  \ and left the airport where I thought I realized this have got to be my worst nightmare\
  \ coming to life.\n\nI walked into a dessert, no buildings around, no walking humans\
  \ around and my heart sank to the thought of is this where I will be living? Is\
  \ this where I will spend whats supposed to be the best 4 years of my life? The\
  \ taxi driver kept on driving me to my destination and that was to a city called\
  \ Kyrenia, It was only the moment we stepped into Kyrenia that my heart felt relieved\
  \ to what it saw.\n\nAs we arrived, I was surprised by the beauty it was hiding\
  \ on your way to it. It's like it didn't want to be exposed, it wanted to be hidden\
  \ to those who wanted to explore and to those who believed that there is beauty\
  \ under hidden.\n\nI started to waltz around the city trying to discover it. Wanting\
  \ to understand it's beauty and its hidden gems. My first stop was the harbor as\
  \ it was too close to the house i stayed in that it only took me 7 minutes walking\
  \ distance to get to it. I was mesmerized by the boats surrounding the sea, by the\
  \ pedestrians walking and enjoying the sun, the music and the food, people dancing\
  \ in the streets enjoying what had to be the last few days of summer. \n\nTwo months\
  \ in the city and I was learning more and more, day and night. I explored different\
  \ villages with green mountains and stray dog houses, others by the sea, Ghost towns\
  \ and historical cities. It was truly astonishing what a place can hide. Churches\
  \ and mosques next door, and most importantly a lifestyle that was for everyone,\
  \ young or old, married or single. It was the perfect getaway to tourists and even\
  \ locales, the place you'd never want to leave even though it's years and years\
  \ behind other countries in infrastructure and leisure.\n\nMy four years were spent\
  \ accordingly, filled with beautiful discoveries and unforgettable memories. It\
  \ was only then that I learned a lesson to never judge a book by its cover. In this\
  \ case, never judge a country by what it lacks, rather by what it hides."
