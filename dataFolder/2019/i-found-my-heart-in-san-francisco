Text: "I left Chicago in the summer of 2015 with a shredded green camping backpack,\
  \ stuffed with essential belongings, and a whole lot of problems.  I didn\u2019\
  t have a game plan.  All I knew was that I needed to GO NOW \u2013 before it was\
  \ too late.\n\nAt some point, while living in Logan Square, working as a legal assistant\
  \ at a law firm in the Loop where the running joke was to sarcastically answer \u201C\
  How are you doing?\u201D with \u201CLiving the dream!\u201D, I had suddenly realized\
  \ that My Life was a 25 year-old trail of confusion, cowardice and stupidity that\
  \ had snowballed into one big massive Mistake.\n    \nI needed a change.  So, I\
  \ cut all my ties and I hit the road.\n  \nI went to Milwaukee, where I spent two\
  \ months channeling Jim Morrison\u2019s ghost in a production full of psychedelic\
  \ lights, booming ethereal music, colorful spoken word, and a whole lot of menthol\
  \ cigarettes and alcohol that played in the basement of a mega-mall.  I went back\
  \ home to Urbana-Champaign, where David Foster Wallace and I both came of age (albeit\
  \ at different times) and got drunk and high with my high school mates.  We drove\
  \ down to New Orleans and did more of the same.  I went to Austin and hid out with\
  \ a queer poet.  We wrote, fucked, did yoga, saw live music, ate Torchy\u2019s and\
  \ played board games.  For a minute, I thought that maybe I\u2019d found my place,\
  \ until I remembered that she was a lesbian, and it was time for me to leave, anyways.\n\
  \nFrom there, I shacked up in Santa Cruz with an old acquaintance.  We hooked up\
  \ despite my better judgment, because my mind had lost the privilege of steering\
  \ the wheel back in Chicago.  We took acid.  I walked along the shores of Seabright,\
  \ lost in alternating spells of great joy and deep anguish.  I almost took a job\
  \ as a P.I., until I freaked out.  We went down into the southern California desert\
  \ for Thanksgiving, where I collapsed into the deepest malaise I\u2019d ever felt.\n\
  \nI was empty, lost and pointless.  I\u2019d tried to lift myself up, but had fallen\
  \ back into the same depressive hole.  I wanted to run away to Nowhere and disappear\
  \ into an empty oblivion.  But every place that I came to turned out to be Somewhere,\
  \ Somehow, with its own new-yet-so-familiar set of troubles.\n\nI was running out\
  \ of options.  My thoughts were getting darker every day.  I felt that I didn\u2019\
  t have much time left before I joined the others from my youth who had made their\
  \ own leaps \u2013 from the tops of buildings, or from the platforms of train stations,\
  \ or onto the needle \u2013 into the certain embrace of an early grave.  I didn\u2019\
  t want to end up there, but I couldn\u2019t stay here either.  As my physical health\
  \ returned, I resolved to make one last leap into the unknown, and see where I\u2019\
  d end up.  I bought a one-way ticket to Oakland, leaving another mess in my wake.\n\
  \  \nI arrived just before noon.  By sunset, I was standing on top of a skyscraper\
  \ in SOMA, high on mushrooms, gazing upon the vast expanses of sky, clouds, mountains\
  \ and sea that lay beyond the cityscape.  I looked with wonder upon the glittering\
  \ freeways that snaked across the urban body like so many arteries.  In the sight\
  \ of it all, buzzing with psilocybin-induced euphoria, I was suddenly struck by\
  \ its beauty and I felt something that I hadn\u2019t felt for a long while: joy.\
  \  I became convinced that I had reached the Promised Land.  I felt that this was\
  \ Heaven on Earth.  That this was a place of real magic where true miracles could\
  \ occur, and, God help me, I could finally heal.\n\nOver the next three years, I\
  \ slowly found myself.  In a city of rejects and weirdos, a (dying) haven for artists\
  \ and transient people that don\u2019t belong anywhere else, I found a home.  And\
  \ along the way, I learned that living \u2013 true, proper living \u2013 requires\
  \ one to stop caring what other people think, open your heart up to the infinite\
  \ possibilities of the future, and continuously make leaps into the unknown."
