Text: "Hi, my name is Cesar, but that is not importabt now, i am an environmental\
  \ lawyer who work for the ministry making public policies; a good cause but so fucking\
  \ boring. \n\nThat\u2019s my formal side, but i have another one that i love tue\
  \ most, a wild side, a lonely backpacker, a rock climber, a clif jumper, a surfer,\
  \ a risk taker, a dreamer. \n\nThis story is about how i give a fuck all my formalities,\
  \ quit my job, take my backpack and just go anywhere to be happy living day by day,\
  \ first step, Thailand, in south east asia.\n\nWhen i arrive bangkok i didnt like\
  \ it, it was just another typical city, so i take a bus to krabi and then a boat\
  \ to railey beach. It was soo beautifull but this time i wasn\u2019t looking for\
  \ paradise or party, i was looking for amazing big mountains, woods, be connected\
  \ with nature, climb everything that i can, so i walk to te other side of the beach\
  \ with my things, cross the woods with a lot of care, and finally arrive to Tonsai\
  \ Bay. What a place!!\n\nAmazing rock formations of 200 meters, lot of caves, spots\
  \ for deep water soloing, hippie vibrations, and wild nature. It was my paradise.\n\
  \nIt is a long story to tell in this square, but lnow this. I left all my life to\
  \ be happy climbing in the most beautifull places. I didn\u2019t care about what\
  \ people think about that, For me being happy is feeling freedom and connection\
  \ in soul.\n\nThe greatest risk i ever took qas going against people\u2019s expectations"
