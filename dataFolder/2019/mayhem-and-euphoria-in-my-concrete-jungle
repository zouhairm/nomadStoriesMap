Text: "Twenty six hours and a little bit of jet lag and I finally made it to New York\
  \ . \n\nWide eyed and ready for my Sex and the city experience it\u2019s usually\
  \ what girls think when coming to NYC . \n\nLittle did I know that I\u2019d be growing\
  \ as a person and a friend , being allured by the sounds and life of this amazing\
  \ city . Something you immediately learn in New York is that you will find at least\
  \ one person that speaks the same language as you because it\u2019s a home to so\
  \ many different types of cultures and languages . \n\nThis is really strange and\
  \ kind of amazing I thought . Cabs honking every other second , these weird clouds\
  \ of smoke coming from the tar which I have yet to figure out what they are for\
  \ . Strangely enough that doesn\u2019t scare you , you feel awake and present as\
  \ you\u2019re senses are overwhelmed by so many sents of food and accents . \n\n\
  Then you make your way to the infamous Times Square and you are immersed with Buzz\
  \ light year , Mickey Mouse and who could forget Andy from Toy story . This is probably\
  \ a kids wildest dream come true if you like being around way too many tourists\
  \ . Regardless it is a sight to behold . \n\nWhen you go to the different bourghs\
  \ you start to r\xE9alise that New York is it\u2019s own little world . \nBrooklyn\
  \ is for the millennials and\u2019 the hipsters . All the Street Art and the street\
  \ style is widely different to that of Manhanttan or Queens and yet they all come\
  \ together some how . \nWhen walking around in the city you feel this uncontrollable\
  \ need to keep looking up because the buildings are all different you could walk\
  \ down the same street and find a Mediterranean building , then a super modern slique\
  \ sophisticated building and then a really old but homey building . \n\nIf you\u2019\
  re the type of person that I am and you fall in love with places and buildings and\
  \ culture you\u2019d never want to leave NYC .  You\u2019re spoiled for choice for\
  \ art galleries and history . \n\n\xC8ven a mundane thing like taking the subway\
  \ Is a little adventure because there is so many types of people down there and\
  \ it\u2019s insalely hot in the summer , contrastingly cold in the winter a concept\
  \ I haven\u2019t figured but out yet as well . \n\nGetting winter kisses on your\
  \ face by the frosty breeze in the city or just watching people for hours as they\
  \ walk to their respective places and jobs . You could literally sit in Bryant park\
  \ and just watch people and fall I love with the way they dress . If you have a\
  \ string interest in fashion NYC is definitely a must see . \n \n\nIf you can survive\
  \ the mayhem that is New York you can surely lake it anymore"
