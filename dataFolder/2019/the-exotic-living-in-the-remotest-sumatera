Text: "It is the area far away from Medan. It takes about 12 hours to reach that village.\
  \ It has a tribe called \"Mandailing\". Based on the Central bureau of Statistics\
  \ 2010 that there are 10.16 percents Mandailing tribe dwelled in Medan. This ethnic\
  \ is originally from the village in the corner Medan. It is still debatable of where\
  \ the ancestor of Mandailing comes from but most believe it is from kampung Mandailing\
  \ which begins from Angkola to near of Pasaman (West Sumatera).  Lots of special\
  \ things at this living. It is located hillside and the scenery is awesome. It really\
  \ feels like you merge yourself to nature. Its nature supports the culture people\
  \ hold makes the village considerable great. If you ask me, how good is it ? It\
  \ is unbelieveable. Its nature is really amazing and its culture at Mandailing is\
  \ crazy tremendous. It is my father's hometown. It is in a region called \" Sibanggor\
  \ Jae\" which i don't really understand what the meaning of it. The only thing I\
  \ know that it serve me a bunch of best things to tell. \n   Therefore, I love the\
  \ way how people treat some visitors. The serve strangers like a relative that belongs\
  \ to them. It feels really close and intimate. For instance, you get into several\
  \ doors for handshaking and small talk because Aid day ( Feast day for Moslem that\
  \ celebrate it after a month fasting. Usually people Will serve the best food on\
  \ their dine to treat people who come to their house such as cake, traditional food,\
  \ dodol ( name of one traditional food) and etc) but conventionally you have to\
  \ take the offer from the host to have big eating with them. They give us an honor\
  \ to feel being their family. No matter how many houses that you have visited, you\
  \ have to sit around them and taste the food they Made. The visiting Will be ended\
  \ up at your house the last house you go. But it could be afternoon after having\
  \ some undeniable treatment by the native. You will get really full at Aid day (\
  \ and the worst is you  can't even sleep), albeit the moments you only get in a\
  \ particular time but don't worry , every time visitor come they will serve you\
  \ well.\n   However, eating is not the only thing we can obtain at the village.\
  \ The nuance and the hospitality will suddenly make you fall in love to this residents.\
  \ Ini spite of the economy runs very slow ( most dweller are Farmers), you have\
  \ to declare the atmosphere you find is memorable. We would find no Shred fat tools.\
  \ If we want to have some exercises we will hike a jungle. Following them work,\
  \ going to forest as their routine if you have fit enough stamina. Once I have ever\
  \ found my uncle through river with a gony of harvest burdened his back and he successfully\
  \ did it. By helping them we will get into their world, knowing how the paddy has\
  \ a complicated process before reaching our mouth and appreciating every sweat for\
  \ it.\n   Moreover, there is a moment that I really fond of. It is called \" Mamungkas\"\
  \ which means the owner of a fish pond will dismantle his own fish pond, then uniquely\
  \ all the neighbor or even whoever pass by can come and join the event. All we can\
  \ catch the fish that we find except particular fish that belongs to the owner such\
  \ as goldfish. I am fond of that habit and significantly fall into the event to\
  \ catch some. It is a bit difficult for one who is not accustomed to. It is really\
  \ enchanting.  We are having fun together at the sametime we fetch the fish. When\
  \ dark comes we can take a bath at authentic hot pool or attain to Mushalla ( a\
  \ building looks like Mosque but smaller). Most of inhabitants are Moslem it must\
  \ be the reason that every time to worship it will be full of people. It is a place\
  \ that people will assemble ini every occasion. We take a bath there ( the water\
  \ is really cold), chit chat, worship and etc. Living there is really joyful moment.\
  \ Come to see and prove it."
