Text: "The American Dream\nIve just met Freddy were both travelling to Tijuana Mexico\
  \ on a bus from Mexico city a long stretch through harsh terrain where Tijuana cartel\
  \ easily bury bodies, two half day journey bound for The United States of America.\
  \ Only thing is I have a passport Freddy doesnt  his final destination is Colorado.\
  \ \nWe connect second day in Mazatlan. Freddy is 42 glowing brown Mexican skin,\
  \ wears a belly, clean clothes, days facial growth a cap a lovely warm friendly\
  \ smile, his english is fluent. Hes from El Salvador he contiues answering engaging\
  \ in our conversation he was deported from America less then a year ago but had\
  \ lived 20 year life in the states, got caught through car parking fines. He doesnt\
  \ know El Dorado and has no family there, only fears the gangsters the robberies\
  \ the violence the stabbings the shootings,  he left that life long ago. He lost\
  \ everything being deported, a good job, a girlfriend, his home, his stable safe\
  \ life, now he wants another chance at a better life so he risks everything or risks\
  \ nothing for everything? He humbly smiles as he answers my curiosity, his grey\
  \ hair and finger fumbling wear the anxiety at wat risks lay ahead for his illegal\
  \ journey to freedom. He tells me hes witnessed someone been shot dead trying to\
  \ cross the border, by military, he fears for this could happen to him, he has no\
  \ bags just a blanket to keep him warm as he tells me this is a cold venture and\
  \ could take days hiding in desert harsh landscape, hes done this before and been\
  \ deported before, he has no money. I offer to buy him lunch he accepts. Hundreds\
  \ of people a week try this crossing illegally with no papers,  he sais for wanting\
  \ a better life than Mexico can give. The American Dream... .\nI now know why I\
  \ took this treacherous bus ride the harder way with 7 check points military searching\
  \ bags bodies for any illegal activity, instead of easy flight. My intuition told\
  \ me take the risk buy the ticket, it was well worth it meeting Freddy.. there were\
  \ others too travelling that day on the bus ....\n."
