Text: "I was around 12 when my parents sent me to your house in Bogota to spend my\
  \ summer holidays, as I would usually do at that time of the year. However, this\
  \ time was an exception - I was on my own. My brother had decided not to come leaving\
  \ me bored beyond doubt. Sitting by the window of your living room, whilst watching\
  \ the cars pass by, you entered.\n\nOut of the blue you broke the silence with a\
  \ few notes of the piano, your beloved piece of life. You didn\u2019t say anything\
  \ whilst I looked at you challengingly as always - like saying \u201CGranny, it\
  \ is not gonna be easy, I\u2019m bored\u201D - and without another word, you clever\
  \ old woman - pointed to the stairs and as a rule of our silent game, I followed\
  \ you. You took me upstairs, to the room that belonged to mum, and enticingly opened\
  \ one of the big wardrobes. Out came a medium-sized cookie box, which you handed\
  \ over to me and with a big smile you began to tell me how romantic grandad used\
  \ to be. I opened the box to find it full of pictures and letters. I rummaged excitedly\
  \ as one would in pursuit of a rare treasure, when I found a picture of what I thought\
  \ was the piano in your living room. You confirmed it, but I couldn\u2019t understand\
  \ how it got to your house in Bogota because I could see \u201C1945\u201D at the\
  \ bottom of the picture and I knew was a European piano. It didn\u2019t make any\
  \ sense to me that an instrument as expensive and rare at that time in our country\
  \ could possibly be in your living room.\n\n\u201CIt was a luxury indeed\u201D you\
  \ said, but you also mentioned that you were obsessed with\nClassical music and\
  \ that my grandad saw it as an opportunity to make you smile. So he got in touch\
  \ with a guy in Calamar, Bolivar (a town situated on the Magdalena River) who owned\
  \ the only piano in the region. It took him letters and trips to convince him to\
  \ sell it, and he finally did. But you were located in El Guamo and I brought up\
  \ the obvious question - I needed to know how in the middle of the XX century, in\
  \ a land that was starting to know about electricity and without paved roads, he\
  \ transported something as big as a piano. So  you explained to me that it was indeed\
  \ the difficult part. \u201CBy mule\u201D you said and I couldn\u2019t believe it.\
  \ I thought it was the most beautiful, powerful and ridiculous image that ever came\
  \ up in my mind. You talked during the whole afternoon about the adventure - as\
  \ you also heard it- because it was a surprise for you. You told me that memories\
  \ were better than reality because they have a sepia tone in your brain, and I couldn't\
  \ agree more.\n\nThat day with the innocence of my young age, I promised you I\u2019\
  ll make the journey in the mule\u2019s memory. At that point you thought I was just\
  \ crazy, and you died before I was able to show you, or tell you about it.\n\nYet,\
  \ here I am. I\u2019ve been walking for 2 hours and my legs are aching. Jacinto\
  \ (the guy listening to my story and old enough to remember the road 74 years ago)\
  \ tells me that we have at least 4 more hours left. I can feel the blood rushing\
  \ to my socks; how 30\xBAC burning my skin had become a pretty paradox, wondering\
  \ what\u2019s the point, why I didn\u2019t bring the camera, if I was ever gonna\
  \ be able to write a story about this, if my notebook is going to be enough, standing\
  \ in a land I heard of, but had never seen before, but moving forward because of\
  \ your guide, listening to you as the breeze passes by as a whisper of reprieve,\
  \ I can hear you saying \u201Cin the mule\u2019s memory\u201D I can hear you playing\
  \ the piano, I can hear you telling me that it is ok to cry."
