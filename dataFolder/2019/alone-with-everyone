Text: "Being alone means a lot of things to a lot of different people.  When you\u2019\
  re alone it brings out different thoughts and emotions.  But when you\u2019re truly\
  \ alone with those thoughts and emotions is when you decide who you really are as\
  \ a human being.  \n\nFor me this moment came back in the beginning of 2018 when\
  \ I took my first ever solo trip to Bali Indonesia.  For me this was a big step,\
  \ I had not taken a jump like this before.  When you go out on your own wherever\
  \ that may be, you\u2019re forcing yourself to go out and be vulnerable, but that\
  \ might be the best part.  It\u2019s scary, nerve  racking and flat out intimidating\
  \ to go into the world with just a backpack some clothes and no real sense of home.\
  \  \n\nBut even though those all might seem like negative things, all the reasons\
  \ your shouldn\u2019t to go on a trip alone. They actually are all the reasons you\
  \ should, all the reasons it makes solo travelling an incredible experience.   You\
  \ really do let go of your comfort zone when you leave behind everything that you\
  \ know, all the friends that you have and all of the comforts and regularities that\
  \ your daily life gives you.   Once you release those fears and realize that being\
  \ comfortable is just a state of mind, your life changes immensely.  \n\nWhen I\
  \ started my travels in Bali, I had absolutely no idea where I was going, what I\
  \ was doing or what I wanted to see. What I did have was a rough outline of the\
  \ type of trip I wanted to have and a positive mindset.   I know I wanted to see\
  \ beautiful locations meet amazing people and have an incredible experience.  All\
  \ three of those things came true, just by putting myself out there and letting\
  \ my true character come out.  \n\nMy first week in Indonesia I stayed in the town\
  \ of Ubud, a beautiful hippy yoga town in Bali.   I remember being very excited\
  \ when I arrived, the hostel looked incredible, it had everything you wanted a pool\
  \ a great view and an incredible energy about it that made it feel like home.  It\
  \ turned out that me booking that very hostel on that very day was the best decision\
  \ that I could have made my whole trip.\n\nI remember the first night I stayed there,\
  \ I was nervous as most, if not all of the people there had groups of friends already\
  \ that they had either started travelling with or met along the way.   But as the\
  \ night progressed I started socializing and realized that there was no reason to\
  \ be nervous.  We were all there for the same reason, we wanted to see the beauty\
  \ of Indonesia.  During that night, I met a girl from Australia, she had many of\
  \ the same goals as I did when it came to what we wanted to see around the area.\
  \  We travelled around Bali for the week together seeing the  beautiful scenery\
  \ that Bali has to offer (and oh it is SO beautiful).  But during that time I made\
  \ connections with others, a group of Swedish girls, that I eventually travelled\
  \ with around the beautiful Gili Islands for a week.  A German girl that I spent\
  \ that last few days with in Bali, even climbing a volcano with on my last day in\
  \ the country.  I consider all of those people good friends that I still talk to,\
  \ to this day.  And I met them all of these amazing people in that one hostel in\
  \ Ubud, all because of that one night when I decided to stop being nervous and put\
  \ everything else aside and started being social and putting myself out there, that\
  \ is when everything started and my joinery began.  \n\nI think it just goes to\
  \ show you, that when you put your fears behind you and stop thinking about what\
  \ everyone thinks, you start to open up and be comfortable with yourself.  I truly\
  \ believe that everyone should go out on their own and travel the world.  Just to\
  \ see where it takes them."
