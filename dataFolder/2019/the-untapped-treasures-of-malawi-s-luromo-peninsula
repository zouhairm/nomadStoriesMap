Text: "To the local inhabitants, it is normal seeing a piece of land stretching into\
  \ a lake and sometimes, the lake stretching into a piece of land. To them, such\
  \ a place is unknown and holds nothing special. \nIn sub-Sahara Africa, in the Northern\
  \ Malawi, there is such a place, \u2018Luromo\u2019.\nLuromo Peninsula meaning \u2018\
  higher ground\u2019 which is 3 kilometres long and nearly 900 metres width stretches\
  \ into Lake Malawi and is bordered by water on three sides of it.\nThe place is\
  \ not just an ordinary piece of land but is a beckoning beautiful place located\
  \ in Karonga District of Malawi, with an estimated terrain elevation 505 Metres\
  \ above sea level.\nA visit to the peninsula one would appreciate the scenery from\
  \ a far in both the sides of the lake and the Tanzanian Mountains seen far beyond\
  \ the horizon.\nBut all these Physical features are an admiration of how much beauty\
  \ the peninsula holds in between the people\u2019s eyes.\nPeople traveling from\
  \ the Northern Malawi City of Mzuzu to the district are greeted by the beauty of\
  \ Luromo peninsula which is seen beyond the Chiweta escarpments.\nA distance of\
  \ about 8 kilometers from the Motor1 Road after Uliwa Trading Centre road block\
  \ will take you to Luromo peninsula.\nThe Peninsula is not a mere stretched piece\
  \ of land into the lake, but it is such a unique gold left hanging in the water,\
  \ with beautiful sand and rocks that holds it in beneath. \nThe topography inside\
  \ the peninsula is a little flat with Sunday-loam soil and the inhabitant\u2019\
  s marvels at the land as they have turned the larger portion of it to grow cassava.\n\
  Majority of People from Group Village Headman Mwandovi who covers a small portion\
  \ of the Peninsula; found solace to live in the area as they benefit from the lake\
  \ proceeds such as the Tilapia fish.  \nHistorical importance \nHistorically, the\
  \ peninsula holds a lot of stories in as far as Ngoni and Ngonde tribes are concerned.\n\
  The place, located on-higher ground was ideal for ngonde tribe because they could\
  \ see their enemy from both directions of the lake.\nTo present day, \u201Cthe peninsula\
  \ has some old broken pots which the ngonde people used to cook their food while\
  \ they hid from the ngoni tribe.\n\u201CApart from the tribal wars with the ngoni,\
  \ the place was also used by the elders to pray for rains when it\u2019s completely\
  \ scarce,\u201D said Chief Wasambo of the area\nBack in the years, the place had\
  \ also rare type of snakes which were very friendly to people who frequently visited\
  \ the place.\nTourism opportunity\nIn other countries, Peninsula offers a great\
  \ deal in terms of tourism industry and trade.\nFor instance, United Arab Emirates\
  \ and Qatar inside the Arabian Peninsula, offers a peaceful and perfect haven to\
  \ a number of culture, religion and trading wonders which Malawi can emulate from.\n\
  Luromo Peninsula in Karonga could be another opportunity to Malawi\u2019s tourism\
  \ industry.\nThe place is a huge asset that yawns to swallow potential tourism investors\
  \ who are ready to turn the place to a flying land inside the waters of Lake Malawi.\
  \  \nThe geographical position and both the topography is conducive and viable to\
  \ huge tourism investment.\nBeneath Luromo Peninsula, there is Chilumba jetty, an\
  \ Aerodrome and National oil Reserve Company of Malawi, which is very strategic\
  \ of how potential the place is, in terms of tourism investments.  \nThe place Peninsula\
  \ is quite exceptional and smart and is ideal for big hotels and other exciting\
  \ tourism investments that can boost Malawi\u2019s economic development.\nDespite\
  \ being an attractive place, the peninsula has been lying idle with no tourism investment.\n\
  This has led to some pieces of the land completely turned into farmland for cassava\
  \ and grazing cattle.\nCurrent economic tourism impact\nAccording to 2018 Travel\
  \ and Tourism economic impact report, the direct contribution of Travel & Tourism\
  \ to Malawi\u2019s GDP in 2017 was 3.5% and is expected to rise by 2.8% and 4.7%\
  \ in 2018-2028 respectively.\nHowever, Luromo Peninsula in Karonga could be another\
  \ untapped resource hanging in the air that has a direct contribution of Travel\
  \ & Tourism to Malawi\u2019s GDP."
