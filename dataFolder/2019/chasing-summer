Text: "24 years and I was ready to see what was outside of South Africa, all of this\
  \ different people here from different countries made me wonder how it was like\
  \ back home, in their home lands.. So my friend and I decided to save up and travel\
  \ to Mozambique \U0001F1F2\U0001F1FF for 10 days, mind you we've never been outside\
  \ of South Africa. The excitement was building up as the days grew closer, so was\
  \ the anxiety, the nerves, 2 girls going to a foreign country alone, but the excitement\
  \ was just too much, it outweighed all the uncertainty. Our passports came out and\
  \ it was go time. We used the cheapest mode of transportation (bus) spent about\
  \ +- 12 hours to get to the boarder, then got onto a local taxi from Maputo to Nyambane\
  \ which was another 12 hours, so we literally spent a whole day traveling, our backside\
  \ was painful from all the sitting. We decided before crossing the border gate to\
  \ call our families and tell them that we have decided not to roam and if they don't\
  \ hear from us in 9 days they should send a search party.\n\nMozambique was everything\
  \ we read about, everything we heard about, the beach was beautiful, the weather\
  \ was lovely and hot, but mostly the people were as friendly and ever, I have never\
  \ met such wonderful, helpful people in my life. We decided not to use our money\
  \ to their kind of food, go out to their hangout places, get the whole experience\
  \ and yes we did.\nWhile on our way to buy groceries, as we booked our selves into\
  \ a self catering, we met this guy who gave us a lift to the market, he also offered\
  \ to show us around.\nLet's give him a name and call him Mr X\n\nMr X came to pick\
  \ us up lunch time and we went to a local restaurant which had the best sea food\
  \ the vibe and people made it such a plessure to eat there, later on that day we\
  \ went clubbing, we actually walked to the club because that place is just that\
  \ safe. Then we went partying by the beach, there is this nice thing that they had\
  \ going on when it is a full moon they celebrate by the beach, amazing.\n\nI'm a\
  \ nutshell I had the time of life is Mozambique, experiencing their culture, eating\
  \ their food, learning their way of life and creating wonderful memories that I\
  \ want to share with the world.\n\nSummer"
