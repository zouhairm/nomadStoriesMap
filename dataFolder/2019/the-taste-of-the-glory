Text: "There is a country where things are very tight at this time, but nothing different\
  \ from a big part of the world in 2019, so one of the best experiences you can have\
  \ is to visit Argentina. \n\nHigh gastronomy, high fashion and culture. People are\
  \ original and have an ambitious lifestyle that makes it possible to continue with\
  \ their dreams in life, there is also a wide variety of places, cities and provinces\
  \ for the small trips you can make throughout your visit to this country, \nPlaces\
  \ where you can taste the flavor of glory with the most delicious meat cuts ever\
  \ seen,  the best beers, high cualities chocolate or ice cream and desserts also,\
  \ the best vegetarian restaurants and the most exquisite \"Facturitas\" that contain\
  \  sweet or savory ingredients for your demanding palate\nas a delicious craving\
  \ that you can not miss on your trip.  All the ingredients of any restaurant in\
  \ this country are original and exquisite. My recommendation would be to try the\
  \ strip of roast and the gizzard of the cow, a very bizarre but delicious dish,\
  \ the famous \"choripan\" and the crumb sandwiches, the Fugazzeta pizza, a delicious\
  \ apple struddle or a typical Italian pastafrola if we want to try other influences.\
  \ \n\nThen, we can find all types of entertainment for all ages, from water parks\
  \ to zoos and nightclubs for night lovers. The country is all year inviting its\
  \ artistic and popular events that always leave much to talk about and little to\
  \ criticize, also  one of the best countries to study in the world, Argentina has\
  \ one of the greatest general stories and its people are pleased to Tell us what\
  \ it feels like to live in one of the most developed countries in South America\
  \ today.  I'm Edward and this is my travel story from my time in Argentina."
