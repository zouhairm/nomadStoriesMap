Text: "2016, two months in, I and my girlfriend wait over the looming spring-break.\
  \ We had just planned a trip to \u2018Chicago\u2019, the cold and windy; it was\
  \ her choice. All tickets were paid for, and reserved.\nThe day had arrived almost\
  \ a month after our reservations, and I was unprepared. Was i excited? Maybe for\
  \ Chicago: I was an international student like her from Pakistan, living, and visiting\
  \ the States. The complication was we had just broken off in the last few weeks.\
  \ Now, we were to sit together, I hoped with compromise but to my likeness, this\
  \ was not the case.\nWe entered Chicago, and entered an Air bnb she had booked.\
  \ She had just booked into a couple's house, and I almost already felt something\
  \ was not right here. We were to stay a week in Chicago, in the same bed, in a clustered\
  \ space, with a ceiling smaller than mine, and her own height. The room was least\
  \ of my worries. \nThe next day I woke up, and realized she had left without me.\
  \ I felt awful but I had no choice but to be in this city she chose on my own. I\
  \ had no idea Chicago could, and would be so cold, and windy. It was a disguised\
  \ appearance similar to Yiyun, my girlfriend. \nA city as cold as her, and I was\
  \ living on a tight budget. I cried in this very city on a cold night in downtown\
  \ while walking past a woman freezing on a bridge holding a placard saying \"I\u2019\
  m pregnant, plz help me\", and I walked passed it twice, to read, to understand\
  \ I was not alone, the misery ran deeper. I turned towards her, went to the bridge,\
  \ walked again as if I had just come, pulled out 4 dollars from my pocket and gave\
  \ her, rushing away, crying across, and praying to God. \nThis feeling was not to\
  \ be matched with my aloof girlfriend, who I\u2019d only see in bed (as we shared\
  \ one) in the night. \nThis was grief, this was a question to God. Before a week\
  \ could pass in this cold city, I had come across some genuinely kind people. I\
  \ went to an Aquarium below downtown, and used my student card for a cheaper way\
  \ into the building. I then stood in line for a photo, complimentary, I felt I had\
  \ no reason to smile, I do not smile at the camera for no reason, that it would\
  \ be an ugly, centric picture. I asked one of the man, the staff who kept the line\
  \ straight to be my friend, and have our picture taken. Great! We both shake hands\
  \ after the picture. \nI made my way to the booth after, and asked for my picture.\
  \ I stared on the screen as he mentioned the minimum of a $40 for the picture. I\
  \ was shocked and immediately said No! Until ten seconds later I see my friend I\
  \ took the picture with. He said, \"Come on man\" take it, here you go, and he pulled\
  \ off $40 from the price. No tags, and I smiled with joy I had not expected.\nI\
  \ left the museum, and made my way elsewhere. I waited for my bus in a stand sitting\
  \ with an old man who had just come out of Church.\nHe did not talk much, and left\
  \ me with an extra hoodie, saying that I should have it. I came home, my day was\
  \ made, and my week was made. \nI remember this I remember this city for its kindness\
  \ for its love for when I needed it the most it shared with me. I felt everything\
  \ in that one week in Chicago, and what I had felt when I entered the air bnb house\
  \ was just as true. The couple hosting us were amazingly going through what I and\
  \ Yiyun had just been in, a separation.\nThey broke off, but for me they, the staff\
  \ at the Aquarium, the old man at the bus stand, my girlfriend, remain to this day\
  \ a reminder of the good in ugliness, of hope in misery, and of joy in wind."
