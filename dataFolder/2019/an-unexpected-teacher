Text: "On march 2016 i travaled along with my mom to Chihuahua, M\xE9xico and i found\
  \ out that true love is the best teacher. Our guide took us to a hidden place that\
  \ wasn't on the schedule because we asked if he could show us something else before\
  \ we took back home. He turned on a hidden road down the highway and we entered\
  \ a place full of trees and life, the view was amazing and as we were going down\
  \ the road we saw very humble and simple houses at the end of the road. Once we\
  \ parked neer the houses a group of people came out to say hi to our guide and he\
  \ introduced us to them, they were the keepers of the place. \nMe and my mom were\
  \ very impressed of the size of the trees and our guide told us there was a cascade\
  \ hidden in that place that could not be seen in the highway. Before he could take\
  \ us to see the cascade a boy bigger than me in age, maybe 25 came running and hugged\
  \ our guide. This boy was very happy to see him and so we knew our guide had a special\
  \ relationship with the people that kept the cascade and the forest safe. \nThe\
  \ boy followed us through our journey into the forest. The road was very rocky but\
  \ we got safe and sound to the edge of a cliff and we saw it, the cascade, \xA1\
  it was astonishing! \nMe and my mother were very happy taking pictures until the\
  \ boy started to pull from my shirt, i didn't know what he wanted until our guide\
  \ told us he couldn't speak due to a malformation in his tongue, he wanted me to\
  \ follow him. My mom encourage me to go, i thought the guide would come with us\
  \ but he said he had an injured in his knee  and that the road to the cascade had\
  \ tired him. \nThe boy and me started to go down a stony road, i was getting a little\
  \ bit tired as i saw the boy go all the way down without stop, my heart started\
  \ to beat real fast and i had to stop to take some air. Before i could turn and\
  \ look for the boy he was infront of me helping me get up and with slower pace we\
  \ continued our journey.\nI found myself as happy as one can be, we were right in\
  \ the base of the cascade, i saw my mom and the guide up in one side of the edge.\
  \ I smiled and ran and jumped and took a couple of photos, i felt a very deep peace\
  \ within myself. The boy was looking at me very happy and we began the road back\
  \ up. \nBefore our guide took us home we said goodbye to the people living in that\
  \ magic hidden place, i saw the boy that accompanied us pick the garbage that was\
  \ on the floor  on our way to the van and put it in a trashcan without complain\
  \ and always with a smile. I understood that that was the power of the universal\
  \ love for life and i hugged him very strongly because he had taught me that no\
  \ matter what are your life conditions, if you decide to be happy for yourself and\
  \ love yourself and others around you, you transmit such a positive energy that\
  \ you change the world.\nI'll never forget this boy, his name i don't remember,\
  \ but his face, teachings and smile will forever be in my heart."
