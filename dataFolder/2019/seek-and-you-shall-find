Text: "It's about 7pm on a warm February night in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, and I'm\
  \ not exactly sure where I'm going as I hop off the bus near the central square.\
  \  While I don't speak Spanish, I do speak French fluently, so I've been wandering\
  \ around Cabo for the past two weeks almost understanding what's going on around\
  \ me, but not quite.  I'm trying to find a boxing gym where, as I understand it,\
  \ some local Lucha Libre wrestlers may or may not be training.  \n\tAfter an abysmal\
  \ 2018 slogging through my daily life in Vancouver, BC, I was relieved and delighted\
  \ when my parents invited me to accompany them to Mexico for a month.  My only worry\
  \ was that I would miss a whole month of training for the only thing that was really\
  \ sparking joy in my life: an independent wrestling show called \u201CGlam Slam:\
  \ Wrestling vs Burlesque\u201D.  New to 'proffesional' wrestling, I'd participated\
  \ in three shows, and was highly anticipating my fourth, I'd even changed my flights\
  \ so that I'd be back in time for it.  But I was nervous.  How good would my performance\
  \ be if I took a whole month off of training?  Would my risk of injury increase?\
  \  Would I forget everything I had learned?  \n\tI knew that Lucha Libre wrestling\
  \ was popular in Mexico and I hoped that maybe I could find some Lucha Libre wrestlers\
  \ to train with while I was there.  I asked around in my local wrestling community,\
  \ but no one had ever heard of wrestling in Cabo, and everyone agreed that Lucha\
  \ Libre was far more commonplace in Mexico City and Monterrey.\n\tOne evening while\
  \ walking along the marina, I saw four Mexican guys performing a skipping show with\
  \ a light up rope.  Except they didn't just skip, they flipped while skipping. \
  \ They jumped from their hands to their feet and back again, did back tucks in the\
  \ air, did rotating front flips, never missing a beat.  I approached them after\
  \ the show and ask one of them \u201CHablas ingles?\u201D but he shook his head\
  \ no.  I manage to string together a sentence about training, asking where they\
  \ do it, but I'm not making sense, or they don't train here.  Finally I pull out\
  \ my phone and play a clip of me wrestling. \u201CHay Lucha aqui?\u201D I ask. \
  \ Ahh si! my new friend exclaims, and now he's phoning someone else, connecting\
  \ me with people on Facebook, giving me phone numbers.  I leave with a date, a time,\
  \ and a location where he thinks the luchadores are meeting next.\n\tSo I'm here\
  \ at the appointed place, appointed time but I'm nervous.  No one responded to my\
  \ text messages or friend requests, so I'm not sure what I'll find.  And this is\
  \ crazy anyway. I hardly speak Spanish. And what if I'm the only woman?  The place\
  \ is a small concrete building next to the running track.  It's a boxing gym.  There's\
  \ a ring in the corner and bags hanging all in a row against the wall, and about\
  \ 25 people practice their punches or skip or stretch.  \n\tEveryone looks at me,\
  \ because I'm obviously new.  A young boy of about 18 approaches me and asks what\
  \ I'm looking for.  I'm fumbling to explain what I'm doing there and older man with\
  \ an air of authority comes over.  I try to explain that I'm a luchadora.  His eyes\
  \ widen.  You're a luchadora he asks?  Yes, and I pull out my phone to show him\
  \ my demo reel.  It's about 3 minutes long, but he watches maybe 15 seconds. \u201C\
  Ok\u201D he says and he motions to the ring.  \n\tThe language of movement is a\
  \ relief.  Lucha style is different, but it's ok, but I don't need words to understand.\
  \  I can just watch and learn.  My eyes are all I need.  We work for about 15 minutes\
  \ and he says ok. I'm welcome to come and train with them for my whole stay in Cabo.\
  \  As I leave, I feel like a hero, like my own hero.  I had been feeling so nervous\
  \ that I almost didn't leave the house, but in the end I found exactly what I was\
  \ looking for."
