Text: "More or less, travelling through my continent was much like travelling through\
  \ similar shades of the same colour. All of them different yet represent the same\
  \ tint. What made this journey special was the leap into the completely different\
  \ shade. The one I had never ever encountered let alone lived in for a certain amount\
  \ of time. Without fear I embarked. I have thrown my heart and just after that I\
  \ have jumped. Journey to Morocco took place right after I finished my studies.\
  \ \nThe real, raw and out of the zone of comfort would be the proper description\
  \ of that journey from this point of view. From that point of view it was everything\
  \ but. It seemed surreal that I would find myself couple of thousand of kilometres\
  \ away from my home, in the biggest dessert on the planet, sleeping with the bedouins\
  \ and dozen of other students from around the world. I couldn\u2019t quite grasp\
  \ what would it mean. But can we actually ever grasp any of the adventures we throw\
  \ ourselves into before they happen?! Do our expectations really shape our experiences\
  \ or are they shaped in the moment and the memory of our expectations just fade\
  \ away?! From this stand point I cannot make up my mind. I didn\u2019t expect any\
  \ of the things I faced in the hot, red Marrakech. Being striped away from the comfort\
  \ I knew my whole life and left with the bare necessities did feel like a punch.\
  \ It made me sober and aware. Life back home seemed so shallow compared to the quality\
  \ of presence in a completely different setting. It was like I was living for the\
  \ first time. Being part of Christian and non-religious youth and then put in the\
  \ heart of Islam culture was extremely challenging. Raised quite liberally on pretty\
  \ much all topics and then put in the constricted culture where you are not allowed\
  \ to question nor to freely express, is difficult. It makes you challenge your own\
  \ notions of society and how it is supposed to look like. It makes you work harder\
  \ to be understood. Expands your mind in finding creative and different ways of\
  \ resolving problems and building bridges. It shows you that there are so many realities\
  \ and that all of them are quite legitimate. \nI was young, shaped person who just\
  \ graduated yet somehow I was no one and had a blank page. I had the opportunity\
  \ to create myself all over again. Away from all of the expectations that surrounded\
  \ me, away from all of the things awarded to me, physical and non-material. All\
  \ the flaws, all of the qualities of character and all of the things that made me\
  \ me, were left behind. Much like the cliche phrase about the layers of an onion\
  \ that represent the inner life of our being. On the surface we are whole, we look\
  \ shiny and just by looking at it one cannot tell if the inside area holds anything\
  \ at all, and if it does, is it pretty or not. What if one finds rotting and damaged\
  \ pieces inside? Only by daring to rip the first layer are we able to discover the\
  \ smaller one inside that might again hold something or it might not. One can, then,\
  \ take those discoveries and deposit them into the conscious mind, that builds a\
  \ picture of oneself and the worlds around them, and use them in the future as tools\
  \ for better life navigation.  The first layer of an onion was peeled. And It felt\
  \ liberating to be seen from new perspective. It allowed me to be break the chains\
  \ of the past. It helped me get rid of the things that weighted me down and gave\
  \ me fresh easiness of being. The one that was child like, playful and not determined\
  \ by all the things I was. That was the discovery of new layers of my own being.\
  \ To this day I find it the most important event to have happened to me. The journey\
  \ made me question what do one relays on when all of the material has been taken\
  \ away. To this day I am still finding the answers."
