Text: "At the base of a great volcano in Costa Rica,  an unknown animal wandered up\
  \ to me, wanting food.  With a snout and a smile,  it sniffed me.  It looked part-bear,\
  \ part-dog, part-rodent.  I wasn't sure what it was.  My boyfriend explained that\
  \ it was a Coati. He said it was obviously used to being fed by tourists but that\
  \ we shouldnt oblige him, no matter how cute and friendly he seemed.  \n\nWe climbed\
  \ a nearby mountain and the air went from hot and humid to crisp and cold in a matter\
  \ of moments.  From the peak,  we overlooked an entire village with fields of corn\
  \ and coffee.  \nIn the forest, I heard a high-pitched screech, like an alarm. It\
  \ was a howler monkey making his presence known. He threw shit at us  from the trees,\
  \ howling with laughter at the silly joke.\n\nReturning to the center of town, \
  \ sloths lazily hung from the gazebo. There were birds of vibrant colours and stray\
  \ dogs roaming the streets.  \nOn the doorstep of the beach house where we were\
  \ staying,  were a dozen raccoons scavenging around, waiting for us to return with\
  \ treats.  \n'These animals sure aren't shy' I told my boyfriend and he agreed.\
  \  He had to shoo them away with a broom.  \n\nWe spent our nights dancing at the\
  \ town festival and drinking Mojitos. Our days,  splashing around in the warm oceans\
  \ with a gentle current and playing Frisbee on the sand. \n\nWe ate plantains, avocadoes\
  \ and mangoes that had never tasted so fresh.  We watched the townspeople parade\
  \ their horses down the street to the sound of Latin salsa music. It was a magical\
  \ and diverse experience I'll never forget."
