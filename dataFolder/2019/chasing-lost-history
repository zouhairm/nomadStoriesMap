Text: "The rotund ticket man, undisputed lord of the small bus station counter, possessed\
  \ a thick mustache and thin patience. Through bluish wisps of cheap cigarette smoke,\
  \ he grumbled,\u201CIt leaves at 3:00, returns tomorrow at 1:30. OK?\" \n\nBut alas,\
  \ it was not OK. I had already booked a room and left my bag in Tatvan, a city on\
  \ the western shore of Lake Van, far in the east of Turkey. Now having spent part\
  \ of the day journeying to this tiny town at the north of the lake, the wisdom of\
  \ my furtive expedition had been thrown into doubt. \n\nDays earlier, flipping through\
  \ the guidebook on a sweltering August bus ride near the Iranian border, I had come\
  \ across an intriguing side-trip: the Manzikert battlefield. As a passionate layman\
  \ history reader, my eyes had lit up. This 11th-century battle saw the army of the\
  \ Byzantine Empire routed by the invading Seljuk Turks, opening the door to Turkish\
  \ conquest of Anatolia. The guidebook's breathless conclusion promised that those\
  \ who did make the trek out, while venturing well off the beaten path, would be\
  \ rewarded with a sight that few tourists see. \n\nHell yes. I would be one of those\
  \ brave few, and claim my reward!\n\nBut I hadn't counted on this scheduling snafu.\
  \ Now my little history-nerd odyssey didn't seem worth getting stranded in a village\
  \ in the middle of nowhere. It just wasn't meant to be.\n\n\u201CNah, I'm not going,\u201D\
  \ I said, turning away from the counter.\n\nI was stopped by a loud, derisive snort.\
  \ I turned back to find the ticket man's cigarette butt smoldering between his fingers,\
  \ his beady eyes boring through me. Then came the explosion. \n\n\u201CWhat??? You\
  \ came all the way from America to see this battlefield, and now you're going to\
  \ turn back when you're this close? What's the matter with you???\u201D\n\nI was\
  \ appropriately humbled, as I saw that my blunt, mustachioed friend was right. Was\
  \ I really about to let a lame double-booked hotel room kill my adventure off the\
  \ beaten path? \n\n\u201CNo, I'm going! Give me that ticket!\u201D \n\nSeveral hours\
  \ later, I stood in front of a weathered brown stone fortress, with a much clearer\
  \ understanding of why this was \"a sight that few tourists see.\" I'd arrived in\
  \ a rickety white van, meandering through a half-dozen sparsely populated Kurdish\
  \ villages. A kind woman sipping tea by the fortress gate had deputized her teenage\
  \ son, busy munching a bag of sunflower seeds, to be my tour guide. With my limited\
  \ Turkish abilities, I was able to understand about twenty percent of his tour,\
  \ a percentage that unfortunately did not include whether the structure had been\
  \ built by the Byzantines or the Seljuks. \n\nBut as my young guide led me up the\
  \ final rampart, I found myself at long last beholding the battlefield from the\
  \ pages of history that had fired my imagination. \n\nAnd...it was a field. A big,\
  \ empty field. \n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, there was nothing particularly unique\
  \ or \"historical\" about it. Though undeniably lovely, with shaded patches of green\
  \ undulating off to the horizon, it would likely have looked equally at home in\
  \ Poland, China, or the U.S. Midwest. \n\nI tried to conjure that similarly scorching\
  \ August day nearly a millennium prior. Two great armies coming to death grips,\
  \ swords clashing, blood spilling. Countless men falling, never to rise again. Yet\
  \ all I could see was the peaceful green field staring back at me. My guide shuffled\
  \ beside me, doubtless impatient to get back to his seeds. \n\nI ended up returning\
  \ to Tatvan just fine that evening, thanks to an overly enthusiastic young taxi\
  \ driver who raced me out to intercept one of the big intercity buses on the main\
  \ highway. We made it despite his frequent hard braking, accompanied by sighs of\
  \ longing, each time we passed a group of women walking along the edge of the road,\
  \ adorned in colorful headscarves and Kurdish robes. \n\nAnd lying in my narrow\
  \ hotel bed that evening, thinking not of absent medieval armies, but of the eclectic\
  \ cast of characters that had generously helped me along throughout the day, I realized\
  \ that I did indeed feel rewarded by the journey."
