Text: "It is all relative\u2026\nBy: Stephanie M. Smith\nThe paths you choose and\
  \ the rabbit holes you go down are everything when it comes to travel. One such\
  \ rabbit hole I was driven to go down, on my first solo trip, brought me face to\
  \ face with my families long forgotten past in Edinburgh, Scotland.  It happened\
  \ in a place called Mary King\u2019s Close, just off the Royal Mile. This place\
  \ is full of ghost stories and supernatural occurrences.\n\u201CFollow me\u201D\
  \ our guide Ava called over her shoulder.  I was a few people back and could only\
  \ see her lantern light descending down into a labyrinth of alleyways, with apartments\
  \ on each side that had at one time reached up eight stories. At one time these\
  \ alley walkways had opened up to the sky above. When the Royal Exchange was built\
  \ on top of them, shutting out every last bit of light in 1753, it became airless,\
  \ dark and oppressive. \n Ava began explaining, \u201CThe Close allowed the inhabitants\
  \ access from the main street level into their apartments.  It was a small gated\
  \ neighborhood that allowed the gates to be locked at night, to keep out undesirables.\
  \ The Closes were named after trades or famous neighbors. This Closes namesake,\
  \ Mary King, was a well to do merchant, seamstress, and purveyor of fabrics on the\
  \ Royal Mile, and married to a Burgess.\u201D   \nA Scottish gentleman, next to\
  \ me, introduced himself as William Craig.  I said \u201CHello\u201D. Thinking to\
  \ ask him more, as Craig was an ancestral family name I was pursuing, but the tour\
  \ was moving along. Our guide continued, \u201CThese poor inhabitants had to deal\
  \ with the wretched smell and stench of raw sewage, as well as, any waste from butchers\
  \ or tradesman coming off the Royal Mile. Edinburgh had become hopelessly overcrowded.\
  \ The city walls prevented expansion out and the granite hill they built on prevented\
  \ building down. This Close was near the bottom of the Royal Mile & was closest\
  \ to a swamp, filled with bio-gases, Nor\u2019Loch. Perhaps that added credibility\
  \ to the strange apparitions seen here.\u201D\nAs we were walking through a lower\
  \ level tenement that had once housed livestock, Ava commented, \u201CWithout proper\
  \ sanitation and plumbing people were forced to throw their chamber pots into the\
  \ streets. If you had the means, in those days, you would have sought to escape\
  \ to the higher level apartments.\nThe saddest history of this place was the plague.\
  \  It was estimated that a quarter of the entire city died.\u201D Iciness crept\
  \ over me at the sad tableau of the dead family in front of me. William said under\
  \ his breath, \u201CA horrible way for anyone to die in such misery and poverty.\
  \ Many of them were my kin.\u201D I felt another chill.  \nBefore I could ask about\
  \ our possible relatives, Ava continued. \u201CThe plague was carried by flea covered\
  \ rodents, who thrived in this environment. Dr. George Rae was one of the few doctors\
  \ who came here. The town council had agreed to pay him well for his services, never\
  \ expecting him to survive. But survive he did, partly due to his very bizarre costume.\
  \ It was made of leather to prevent flea bites and the head was like that of a crow.\
  \ He would stuff the long beak with protective sweet smelling herbs, to combat the\
  \ noxious odors.  Dr. Rae never received payment for his services.\u201D \nThe people\
  \ living there were quarantined, then built on top of, and closed off to the light\
  \ until a 19th century excavation.  As we ended the tour, there was a wall with\
  \ the names of those who lived in the Close. It was there that I noticed the name\
  \ Craig. The hairs on the back of my neck shot up. I looked around for William,\
  \ but I never saw him again. \nReturning from my trip, I was intrigued to find out\
  \ more about Clan Craig. I discovered there had been a William Craig, a merchant\
  \ in this Close, during the plagues. Even more astonishing, his son, James, was\
  \ one of the architectural designers of the New Town of Edinburgh.  It really is\
  \ all relative to me."
