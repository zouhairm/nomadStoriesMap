Text: "The first time I went to Venice I was seven years old. It must have been spring\
  \ break. To this day I don\u2019t know why my father decided to take me and my ten-year-old\
  \ sister to Europe, while my mother and baby brothers stayed home. \nI remember\
  \ the apartment we stayed in, a local\u2019s apartment, something uncommon in the\
  \ days before AirBnb. I remember the smells: the faint scent of sewage that occasionally\
  \ rose from the canals, the damp streets freshly wet from April rain, cigarette\
  \ smoke hazily drifting by at outdoor terraces. I remember the food: the funghi\
  \ pizzas that my sister unfailingly ordered every night, the prosciutto sandwich\
  \ that I ate in a restaurant where we were the only (and admittedly unwelcome) tourists,\
  \ the squid ink pasta, black as carbon, which both disgusted and intrigued me. I\
  \ remember a seemingly endless stream of churches that my dad, a history lover,\
  \ forced us to stop in, my agony reflected on the faces of multiple Saint Sebastians.\
  \ I remember standing in Piazza San Marco, arms outstretched for pigeons to land\
  \ on, crying out when one got stuck in my curly hair. I remember taking a water\
  \ bus, marveling at the fact that a city could exist without cars. I remember the\
  \ feeling the city gave me, something magical and mysterious yet slightly melancholy.\
  \ \nI recently returned to Venice with my sister. Sixteen years after our first\
  \ visit, and three weeks after our father\u2019s funeral. The trip, we had planned\
  \ for in advance. The loss, we hadn\u2019t. I thought that perhaps I had misremembered\
  \ the city from my first visit, that as I child I had invented things that would\
  \ look different through an adult\u2019s eyes. It was remarkable how many things\
  \ seemed to remain exactly the same. The gondolas gliding effortlessly down the\
  \ canals, leaving gentle ripples in their wakes. The throngs of tourists outside\
  \ of San Marco\u2019s Basilica (though the pigeons were notably absent). The dark\
  \ narrow alleyways, difficult to navigate even now with our smartphones. It was\
  \ almost as if Venice had been preserved in a snowglobe. \nAnd yet, for us, so much\
  \ had changed. My father\u2019s absence was a ghost walking alongside us. We had\
  \ no one to tell us about the unique Venetian architecture or to give us a historical\
  \ account of the noble families that once ruled the city. No one to drag us into\
  \ church after church, no matter how small or how similar it seemed to the last\
  \ one. \nWe went to places we had been before, and were awed at things that we hadn\u2019\
  t remembered. We also went to places we had never seen, and made new memories in\
  \ a city that was stuck in time. As we sat outside at a caf\xE9, my sister gestured\
  \ to the sun setting over the lagoon, \u201CDad would have loved this.\u201D I nodded\
  \ sadly. She continued, \u201CHe would also love to see us here, together.\u201D\
  \ We toasted our cappuccinos to him and sat contemplatively in the December sunlight.\n\
  At the end of our day, we stopped at the Bridge of Sighs. I remembered the story\
  \ my dad had told us years ago. When prisoners were being led to their cells, they\
  \ would have one final view of Venice through a tiny window on this bridge, and\
  \ the beauty of it would make them sigh. I never confirmed if this story was true,\
  \ but it has stuck with me for almost two decades. My dad, a romantic, liked to\
  \ believe it, and so did I.\nWatching the greenish water lap against decaying stone\
  \ steps, I imagined a future where Venice would be fully underwater and all that\
  \ would remain were the stories people told about it. How could our memories be\
  \ enough to keep something so special alive? Could we let it go with just a sigh?\n\
  For me, Venice remains magical and mysterious, and has grown even more melancholy.\
  \ But something about its eventual submersion makes the city all the more enchanting.\
  \ Even this place, so rich with art, history, food, culture, and memories, will\
  \ have an end. And so we must appreciate it all the more while it\u2019s still here."
