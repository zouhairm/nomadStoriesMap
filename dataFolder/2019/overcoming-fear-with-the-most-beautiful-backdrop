Text: "Travel is for adventure. It can be jumping off a cliff, trying a local delicacy\
  \ or maybe facing your fears. I unknowingly signed up for the latter. \n\nThailand\
  \ has many different facets, and an eco tour where you canoe in the ocean is definitely\
  \ something different. It\u2019s called  Phang Nga Hong by Starlight. When you can\u2019\
  t swim and think you will probably drown... it makes for a stressful day out. \n\
  \nThe day started out well. We were given a run down of the day and (importantly)\
  \ I made sure the life vest fit. It did - Great start! Getting on the canoe was\
  \ daunting. There is a trick to getting on without tipping, and unfortunately my\
  \ partner didn\u2019t seem to listen to instructions - nothing like adding to the\
  \ nerves. That process never got easier the more I tried. All I could picture is\
  \ falling out and sinking like a bag of rocks. We had a guide who was actually doing\
  \ all the canoeing - and making sure I didn\u2019t fall in! \n\nThe tour itself\
  \ was amazing... you are canoeing into caves... needing to lie down to enter some\
  \ of them. The rocks are so sharp we are warned to be careful as the rock can cut...\
  \ \u201Cbut it\u2019s ok, if you need plastic surgery to fix it, Thailand has good\
  \ surgeons\u201D. As you lie back on the person behind you you can literally see\
  \ the light at the end of the tunnel. The insides of the cave are a stark contrast\
  \ to the outside. The exterior, all you see is just rocks, but the inside is vibrant\
  \ green plants climbing up and down the walls of the cave, and the floor is muddy\
  \ but like quicksand. We are advised don\u2019t get out or we lose a shoe. It was\
  \ like we were entering an ecosystem of its own. It was quite surreal.\n\nOur second\
  \ cave we meandered through the cave until we were able to reach a spot that we\
  \ could get out and walk around. It was here we were able to spot baby hermit crabs...\
  \ and take quite a few photos as well. As you are standing you are only then understanding\
  \ how small you are in comparison to your surroundings. It\u2019s a very humbling\
  \ experience. \n\nWe see three caves in total, learn about Loi Krathongs and make\
  \ our own to release into the final cave. Ours was definitely the prettiest with\
  \ kissing lovebirds... maybe this Loi Kratong was a sign.\n\n(Loi Krathongs are\
  \ to make an offering on the full moon in November to get rid of last year\u2019\
  s bad luck and ask for good luck for the year ahead.)\n\nWe arrive into the final\
  \ cave to release our offerings. It is a beautiful moment for us to be involved\
  \ in, as this activity was actually done on the full moon. As it was an eco tour,\
  \ the Krathongs are then recollected and brought back on the boat, as to not leave\
  \ waste.\n\nFor someone who was so scared of the experience, to be able to witness\
  \ bioluminescent plankton I was like a little child in a pool for the first time.\
  \ I was in awe of the neon colour radiating out of the water for a brief moment.\
  \ There was squeals of delight as I tried to figure out how to make the plankton\
  \ illuminate for longer as I splashed all the water around. Splash, splash, splash,\
  \ there has to be a way.... nope, we are going back to the boat - now I\u2019ve\
  \ missed my chance. \n\nAlthough it was an experience of growth for me going into\
  \ the unknown... little did I know it also would become a step into the unknown\
  \ for my partner. That night he would ask me to be his wife... it was definitely\
  \ a day where we both leapt into the unknown and came out better on the other side."
