Text: "As I touched down in London town, it was almost midnight, and I was pretty\
  \ terrified of the city. I wasn\u2019t scared due to the fact that it was dark,\
  \ but I was more confused than anything. I hopped on the last train to the city\
  \ center, made my way to the double decker bus, and walked about a mile to my hostel.\
  \ As I was walking, I felt a little more comfortable, there were young adults just\
  \ hanging around and partying like you see anywhere else. Yes, I got lost a couple\
  \ of times, but still managed to make it to my hostel at a reasonable time. As I\
  \ entered my room and laid at the top of my bunk bed, I couldn\u2019t sleep one\
  \ bit, but I knew that I was ready to embark on a journey of a life time. When I\
  \ woke up the next morning, I was very excited to eat the free breakfast that the\
  \ hostel provided. Turns out their breakfast only consisted of breads, cheeses,\
  \ and some fruit. Culture shocked, you can say, because in America we will never\
  \ be satisfied by a breakfast like this, but I\u2019m not in America anymore. Anyways,\
  \ I was really lost and felt like the best way for me to know this city is to go\
  \ on a free walking tour provided by the hostel, and so I did. Mind you, I have\
  \ planned an itinerary for my time in London, but wasn\u2019t brave enough to experience\
  \ all of this on my own yet. While on the walking tour, we pretty much visited all\
  \ of the attractions that were on my list for the first and second day on my itinerary.\
  \ I even ventured out to explore more of London after the walking tour, and learned\
  \ about Brexit, visited historical museums, ate a traditional English dinner, and\
  \ even had some conflict on the tube. But all of it was worth it because I felt\
  \ like I could truly blend in with the locals. \nOn my third day, I met another\
  \ American that was from Los Angeles, who was staying in a bunk bed next to mine.\
  \ Surprisingly, London was his first stop too, and we talked 10 to 15 minutes about\
  \ what we are looking forward to on our Euro-trip. I never thought I would talk\
  \ to him again, until I realized that he made friends with a girl I met earlier\
  \ that day from Australia. She asked if I wanted to eat burgers with her and the\
  \ new friends that she made, so I said yes. There I met a guy from Melbourne, two\
  \ guys from Montreal, a girl from Argentina, and the Angeleno that I met earlier\
  \ in my dorm. We had a blast, we got burgers from a restaurant in Soho, we went\
  \ to Tesco to buy alcohol, and we socialized in the lobby talking about everything.\
  \ We talked for hours and hours, watched the World Cup, reminisced about music festivals,\
  \ bonded over our favorite artists, and even went out to a nightclub. The next day\
  \ was my last day in London, and I didn\u2019t get out of bed until 2 in the afternoon,\
  \ but I eventually did do the last bit of exploring that I had on my itinerary.\
  \ I eventually came back to the hostel to talk to my new friends and as I expected,\
  \ we went out again. We did almost exactly what we did yesterday, except we could\
  \ no longer drink in the lobby, so we drunk in one of the dorms upstairs. That night\
  \ was different from the night before, we decided to take on the town, we danced,\
  \ talked, and listened to music. It was like a scene from a movie, we talked to\
  \ people as we were passing by them, and they even knew the lyrics to a lot of the\
  \ songs that we were playing. We even got lost and had to find our way back to the\
  \ hostel without a working cell. Unfortunately, this was everyone\u2019s last day\
  \ in London, but luckily it wasn\u2019t the last time we\u2019ll see each other."
