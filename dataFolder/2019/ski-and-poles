Text: "Sitting now in a hostel full of people who want me to go away, I\u2019ve got\
  \ few money in my pockets and many many challenges ahead. Sitting now in a hostel\
  \ full of people who want me to stay, I\u2019ve got thousands of pictures and many\
  \ many challenges behind. \n\nI came here a week ago knowing literally nothing about\
  \ this country called Switzerland. I may swear you won\u2019t find a word below\
  \ about the beauty of this place, traditional cousin and touristic traps. Traveling\
  \ have never been about visiting places and putting ticks for me. \n\nIt would not\
  \ lie saying that this trip is the most challenging experience in my life and the\
  \ most disputable stamp in my passport...\nThere are 50 of us staying in a chalet\
  \ in the mountains literally in the middle of nowhere. This is the first time we\
  \ met each other and mean to stayed here all together sharing rooms, bread and slopes.\
  \ But in only few days we started to share insults, tears and rumors. Suddenly I\
  \ found myself being involved into some conflicts and you may easily imagine the\
  \ way the community changed and split into small groups. Groups which are forced\
  \ to stay together. Forced by several obstacles and circumstances starting from\
  \ the fear of losing a job and ending with the fear of a snowstorm lasted few days\
  \ already.\n\nIt sounds like a totally negative story but at the same time it\u2019\
  s not. It\u2019s a story about trying to tame not only mountains but also yourself.\
  \ A story about finding your balance and your speed not only skiing but also living\
  \ the moment and adapting to it. I fell and hurt myself every day, I had a drink\
  \ and made it all even worse every night. Being so far out of a comfort zone I was\
  \ not able to control my mind same as I wasn\u2019t able to control my body rolling\
  \ down the slope losing poles. But there was no way to escape and I only might let\
  \ it go, practice, grow, evaluate and improve a little bit more than it\u2019s possible.\n\
  \nI remember myself playing snowballs and laughing on the very top of the mountain\
  \ with a young and charming guy from the States. I remember myself hiding, whispering\
  \ and making jokes instead of making complaints with a new friend from Serbia. And\
  \ I remember myself sliding down with a speed of light and staying alive knowing\
  \ that a big gentle giant from Holland is next to me to give a hand and another\
  \ piece of advice. I couldn\u2019t describe with words how much I\u2019m grateful\
  \ to all of them for being my poles these days. Especially the one and only who\
  \ was miles away in Sicily but always on the phone trying to support me in any possible\
  \ way. Well... traveling have never been about geography or covering a map with\
  \ Facebook contacts for me. But all these people from different cultures and generations\
  \ created a peace out of a war, turned the red color into white and put a huge smile\
  \ sticker upon my grumpy face. They are responsible for making me stronger, kinder\
  \ and much much happier.\n\nThat was my leap into the unknown and I\u2019m extremely\
  \ proud about its results. Cause now sitting in a hostel full of people who shared\
  \ moments with me, I call myself \u201Clucky\u201D for getting and using a chance\
  \ to explore more than just a country but my limits and for doing more than sightseeing\
  \ but overviewing myself. And it\u2019s time to go back downstairs to give them\
  \ a hug..."
