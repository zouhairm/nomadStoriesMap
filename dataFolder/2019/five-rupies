Text: "Five rupies in my pocket. \"This is it\" I thought as I roamed like a dead\
  \ man through crowded Kathmandu. My sandals torn and a mixture of mud, blood, burned\
  \ garbage and who knows what else going deep into my toenails. The derelict environment\
  \ soothed me somehow, the mingled wires, the wandering cows, the dirt and the smoke\
  \ all reminded me how things don't always work as planned in life. So much information\
  \ was going through my head that suddenly it all went blank; up the stairs of Swayambunath\
  \ temple I exhaled the deepest breath I've probably ever taken. \nMonkeys ruffling\
  \ and stealing fruit from the tourists, kids playing with the rolling Buddhist scripts\
  \ that surround the stupa, some monks chanting and some old wrinkled locals chatting\
  \ away in fast dialect while keeping a close eye on the movement of people. How\
  \ long have I been living in this country? Is it possible that my fate is now forever\
  \ intertwined with the Nepali folklore?  The smell of fresh cucumber caressed my\
  \ nostrils with its earthy scent making my starving stomach pur like a wild cat.\
  \ How many days since I last ate a grain of rice? How have I managed to become so\
  \ miserably poor? That's when I looked around jingling my last coin, that worthless\
  \ piece of metal that wouldn't even buy me a meal and realized I needed piety more\
  \ than ever. I wanted to cry but I didn't, I just walked down the infinite stairs\
  \ of the temple with my head tilted down and dragged my feet as If I were a ghost.\
  \ A man stood in front of me and I lifted my head to dive deep into his watery eyes;\
  \ he smiled and without any words he put a cucumber on my hand. Even though I tried\
  \ to keep it together, I broke down and cried. I felt as dirty and humid as the\
  \ world I was living in but I didn't care anymore, I just sunk my fangs into that\
  \ cucumber as fast as I could and felt a smooth release of my unbearable hunger.\
  \ When I looked up the man had left. I looked all around searching for those clear\
  \ eyes that were like an oasis amidst the sun kissed roughness of his skin but found\
  \ myself in an ocean of colorful dresses and dark hair. I smiled for the first time\
  \ in a long while. I smiled because those five rupies now felt like a fortune, my\
  \ poverty felt like the entrance to a new world much bigger than money, much bigger\
  \ than any western preconception. \nI had come to Nepal in search of truth, in pursuit\
  \ of mankind at its purest state and that is exactly what I had just found; when\
  \ there is nothing left to loose, when all you have is yourself, people will see\
  \ you exactly as you are. I thought about this lesson of life while I walked back\
  \ to the city center looking for some shelter to spend the night and felt so light,\
  \ so empty of worries that everything started to work out. A man tossing chapati,\
  \ with a swift movement of the hand fed me, a woman with beautiful eyes gave me\
  \ coffee and a little boy whom I had seen often in the streets led me to his home\
  \ where I spent the night on a little corner of the room close to the red ambers\
  \ of the cooking fire. Suddenly I was the richest man alive and I knew it. \nI found\
  \ work in a farm and lived among the truest human beings, there I learnt the worth\
  \ of 5 dollars which was my daily salary for the toil that started at dawn and ended\
  \ way past the starry nights of the Kathmandu valley. A month had elapsed since\
  \ that moment I held my five rupies with despair when I fell on a ditch full of\
  \ water while working the night shift at the farm; I looked around to see nothing\
  \ but peace surrounding me, going through me, breathing me in; at that moment a\
  \ swarm of fireflies surrounded me and I knew I was blessed to be alive."
