Text: "I\u2019ve always been a big fan of walking. It\u2019s simple, it\u2019s free,\
  \ it\u2019s easy. I\u2019d never bother with another form of transport when something\
  \ is within walking distance. \n\nYou can see things, too. Spot an animal in the\
  \ bushes that you\u2019d never have noticed had you taken the train or maybe overhear\
  \ a conversation between two strangers on a first date. \n\nYet, I had realised\
  \ that my walk to work had become mundane and no longer exciting. I had stopped\
  \ seeing everything that once amazed me. I had stopped appreciating the city that\
  \ had been my home for less than three months.\n\nThree months it had taken me to\
  \ acclimatise to Nagoya. Within a month, I\u2019d done all of the tourist nonsense,\
  \ I\u2019d visited the castles, taken pictures at the zoo, and been up to the top\
  \ of the tallest towers to take in the nighttime view of the city. Then I found\
  \ a job and that had lead me to this (almost) daily 40 minute commute. \n\nAnd heck,\
  \ it was a walk I enjoyed. Never before had I been able to see so many things, take\
  \ in so many sights in one walk. The sun was often beginning to set as I made my\
  \ way towards work, giving everything a hazy glow. Pair the sky with the tall, overpowering,\
  \ skyscraping apartment blocks and you can bet that I was stopping to take pictures\
  \ every couple of yards, where the buildings framed the sunset just right. \n\n\
  I\u2019d seen enough sunsets, however. In fact, I was beginning to feel like I\u2019\
  d seen it all. \n\nI\u2019d been starting to spend time looking for \u2018things\
  \ to do in Nagoya\u2019 and not finding anything that excited me. I\u2019d seen\
  \ countless Japanese gardens, temples, shrines and castles. My Instagram was littered\
  \ with shots of cityscapes. Ordering food based off pictures alone had become the\
  \ norm. \n\nIn short, I was no longer travelling, seeing new sights, and enjoying\
  \ myself. I had settled in one place and had accepted the mundanity of daily life\
  \ in Japan. \n\nWhich is sort of what I had hoped for, in a way. I didn\u2019t want\
  \ to be one of those \u201Cgap yah\u201D girls, whose experiences in India and Singapore\
  \ had changed them, allowed them to find their true selves. I wanted something grittier,\
  \ more akin to real life. As it turns out, though, real life in another country\
  \ is just, well, life. \n\nI was musing over this on my walk to work, as when you\
  \ stop seeing what\u2019s around you on a walk, you being to reflect on what\u2019\
  s inside you, when I saw her. \n\nNow, I\u2019d seen her a few times, always dressed\
  \ in shorts and a black coat, hair as matted as a neglected fluffy dog. I would\
  \ assume she was homeless, though I couldn\u2019t be sure, and as far as I was aware,\
  \ her daily routine consisted of moving peoples bikes from one place to another\
  \ and watching with amusement as they struggled to find their bike. \n\nWe made\
  \ eye contact, regarding each other with curiosity. I passed and continued along\
  \ the familiar road, but my inner dialogue had changed. \n\nI continued thinking\
  \ about the strange woman, whose presence was almost as bizarre as the man who wore\
  \ a Power Rangers costume, who, by some weird coincidence (at least, I hope it is\
  \ coincidence), I frequently see when I\u2019m on a date. \n\nThen I thought about\
  \ all the other people I\u2019d met in my short time here; my coworkers who were\
  \ more like family members, tinder dates who had become close friends, expat neighbours\
  \ who had stories to tell, and I realised something. \n\nMy time out here would\
  \ not be feel fulfilling with me searching for the next Instagrammable sightseeing\
  \ destination or tourist attraction that would make a popular blog post. \n\nIt\
  \ would be people, and lots of them, that would fascinate me, and take me to underground\
  \ bars that play heavy metal music or tiny tea shops that serve only one type of\
  \ tea. People that would tell me stories, and listen to mine. \n\nDestination does\
  \ not matter, when you\u2019ve got no one to guide you and no one to guide. \n\n\
  Nowadays, I rarely walk home alone."
