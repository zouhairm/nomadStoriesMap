Text: "\"Nona, I'm going to Italy, your home!\" are the last words I remember telling\
  \ my grandmother, and those words were bouncing in my head the whole journey from\
  \ Rome to Naples.  However, after visiting the provinces of the North Italy, that\
  \ promise stopped feeling a desire and the happiness I hoped to find by knowing\
  \ my roots were gone. Alone, with the lost look in the window of that train and\
  \ without knowing why, I felt disappointed, empty, and deceived by that tourist-Italy\
  \ that in spite of being the fashion capital of the world, despite its beautiful\
  \ rivers and canals, its ancient history and its architecture, nothing made me remember\
  \ my Nona.\n\nNoisy, Dirty and messy were the first feelings that Naples generated\
  \ in me when I first noticed the honks, the yells among merchants and the wet clothes\
  \ lying on the windows of the houses left to dry by sunlight. \n\n\u201CYou must\
  \ take care of yourself, the south is dangerous\u201D my aunt insisted for almost\
  \ six times when she called me. However, I didn't get prejudiced and all that chaos\
  \ was beginning to please me, and I felt comfortable in it.\n\nAnd it was a matter\
  \ of minutes in that city to affirm the deception of the North-tourist Italy and\
  \ to have faith in my promise again. My Argentine jersey made me a kind of ambassador,\
  \ a witness of the prophet, the distant relative whom they always wanted to meet.\
  \ It was a matter of walk a few blocks until the natives welcomed me shouting out\
  \ \"Viva Maradona!\" inviting me with no words but with theirs eyes to talk about\
  \ that player, to talk about soccer and the blood connection (I would dare to say\
  \ brotherhood) between Argentina and Italy. I even got a slice of free pizza for\
  \ bringing back to them the memories of their idol.\n\nGrandmothers preparing homemade\
  \ tomato sauce to sell at the street fair, the homemade pasta left to dry on the\
  \ shelters, the smell of freshly made pesto, all reminded me of my childhood when\
  \ we met for lunch, every Sunday, at my Nona's house.\n\nEven though my Nona was\
  \ from Cattanzaro, even further south, and that for different reasons my trip ended\
  \ in Naples, I understood that what people say about Italy being divided into north\
  \ and south was not only a football myth, it was real and I could immediately notice\
  \ it in the affectionate warmth of its people. \n\nAs Goethe once said \u201CSee\
  \ Naples and then die\u201D."
