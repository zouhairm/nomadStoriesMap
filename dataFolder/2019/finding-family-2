Text: "Entering a speedboat with fifteen strangers to a hostel sitting in the middle\
  \ of the San Bernardo Islands on the coast of Colombia. I could smell the salt in\
  \ the air as I took one last look around the docks, watching as other boats took\
  \ off to their destination. The skies were the clearest I had seen while there,\
  \ and the sun had the perfect blaze. The locals were still attempting to sell us\
  \ passengers everything, from hats, to water shoes and sunglasses. They were the\
  \ humblest people, with the biggest smiles.  As we buckled our seat belts and secured\
  \ our life vest, I glanced over my shoulder and admired the postcard-like panorama\
  \ of the breathtaking waters ahead. \nWe quickly picked up speed. Crashing into\
  \ the waves the water constantly splashed into our faces. I eventually got used\
  \ to it and enjoyed the wind along with the slight splashes of saltwater hitting\
  \ my face. For almost two hours it felt like I was on the wildest roller coaster\
  \ ride. The free fall made me feel weightless, while the harsh landings brought\
  \ me back to reality. With all this free time, away from social media and any other\
  \ form of communication, I was left with a lot of time to just enjoy the natural\
  \ scenic views. Even though the sound of the wind and water were extremely noisy,\
  \ it was easy to tune it all out with the breathtaking sights I was along the way.\n\
  As the boat began to slow down, I began to look around eagerly for the hostel. In\
  \ the distance, I could see it, just as it looked in the pictures. As we got closer,\
  \ we experienced a warm welcome from the current guest and staff there at Casa en\
  \ el Auga. After being shown where to eat, poop, pee, and shower, I decided to go\
  \ upstairs to drop my things off in my room. Before I made it up the stairs, I was\
  \ stopped by two guys that asked me \u201CAre you going to Isolate?\u201D I looked\
  \ at them completely puzzled. For one, they had heavy German accents. Secondly,\
  \ I had no idea what \u201CIsolate\u201D was. \nAfter a short explanation, and sharing\
  \ backgrounds of where we were all from, one guys says to me, \u201CYou must go\
  \ to Isolate, I promise you, it is nothing like you\u2019ve ever seen before.\u201D\
  \ He pointed across the water, and in the distance, I see this small island. After\
  \ hearing a little about it, I wasn\u2019t too impressed. I figured it was a small\
  \ island that dealt with poverty. As I declined one last time, two little boys arrived\
  \ to the hotel on a boat. They came over from Isolate. They helped catch fish and\
  \ other seafood to serve to people at the surrounding hostels. Something about their\
  \ smiles and demeanor made me have a change at heart. The boat ride over to the\
  \ island was a moment I will never forget. On arrival, the locals smiled and waved.\
  \ Walking on the island I stayed near the back of the group and got lost in my own\
  \ world. I know very little Spanish but during my time there I learned that a smile\
  \ is a universal language. I played soccer in the narrow pathways with children,\
  \ and shared snacks with them. A worker from the hostel translated for me so I could\
  \ talk with some of the local woman about where I was from and the many differences.\
  \ We talked about our families and a woman introduced me to her daughter who was\
  \ the same age as me, and resembled a lot. On my departure, I hugged so many people\
  \ who were an hour ago\u2026just strangers. We shared so much without being able\
  \ to speak the same language. I left the small island with something that I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find. Family."
