Text: "She was waving her arms around, swinging them wildly from side to side. \u201C\
  Get ready to pa-pa-pa-pa-partayyyy!\u201D She repeated rhythmically to the music\
  \ blasting from the DJ\u2019s Segway, circling her as she danced around the hall.\
  \ As the music changed, her moves shifted to a more house dance style, a staccato\
  \ jump from foot to foot like some video game figure. \n\nHer co-worker was pulling\
  \ out her Brazilian dance moves. She pumped her fist, her fanny pack lurching up\
  \ and down, stopping only to high-five the attendees as they walked through the\
  \ maze of stanchions, ready to board the bus to take them to the capstone event\
  \ party at the Vegas Festival Grounds. \n\n\u201CKeep going!\u201D I called out,\
  \ alternating with, \u201CHave fun!\u201D \n\nOne attendee laughed and replied,\
  \ \u201CAre any of you even from Vegas?\u201D \n\n\u201CMaybe?\u201D I said. \n\n\
  It was a fair question. Day four into the weeklong tech conference in Vegas, and\
  \ we\u2014 the crazed, sleep-deprived dancing lunatics working the event\u2014 were\
  \ a mixed bunch. Our team consisted of a dancer from San Francisco, a voiceover\
  \ actress from LA who did the Portuguese dubbing for Disney films, a nomadic photographer\
  \ just returned from Bali, and a newly pregnant small-town California mom intent\
  \ on hiding her pregnancy. The annual tech event brought in nearly 50,000 attendees\
  \ spread across six hotels, and to accommodate the volume, staff was flown in from\
  \ all over the country. I could only think of a handful of fellow staff I\u2019\
  d met who lived in Vegas, the most notable being a Denver native. She had told me\
  \ she was tired of all her Denver shops closing. \u201CSo I asked God,\u201D she\
  \ said, \u201Cwhat will never close? And he told me: Vegas.\u201D \n\nOur team was\
  \ tasked with providing shuttle directions and keeping the mood upbeat. This involved\
  \ making sure attendees found the right bus, yelling (enthusiastically), and standing\
  \ in a parking lot from sunup past sundown. By the end of our 14- to 18-hour shifts,\
  \ our feet were numb, our hands dry and crusted with desert dirt, our eyes bleary.\
  \ \n\nThis was not the glitz and glam of Vegas; it was the grit and grind. It was\
  \ a side I hadn\u2019t seen before. \n\nMy first time in Vegas had been for my birthday,\
  \ all hotel and casino, an endless maze with no clocks, stilettos marching in air-conditioned\
  \ alertness. A neon night and smoky dream that evaporated the next day. I\u2019\
  d barely left the resort, save for a brief hungover jaunt on the Strip, which left\
  \ me sunburnt and retreating back to the safety of indoor caf\xE9s and gelaterias.\
  \ This time, I  stayed at an Airbnb a few miles off the Strip\u2014 a suburban Vegas\
  \ that had previously laid beyond my imagination. It was only a 10-minute drive\
  \ away, but the Strip\u2019s shiny international corporatism quickly morphed into\
  \ motels, fast food, discounted all-you-can-eat buffets, and 80s fitness centers\
  \ frozen in time. Drive the other way, and you'd hit boho cafes, art galleries,\
  \ and reggae bars that created a Portland-esque Nevada.  \n\nOn my daily commute,\
  \ I met a parade of Uber drivers from elsewhere. They\u2019d moved to work the blackjack\
  \ tables, retired from tenured professorships for warmer weather and cheaper cost\
  \ of living, relocated from the Bayou to work in the antique business. \n\nTo be\
  \ from Vegas is to be from somewhere else. And while Vegas has always been a paradox\
  \ on-paper\u2014 abundance in the desert, a land of former divorce ranches coexisting\
  \ with little wedding chapels\u2014 as the conference wound down, I\u2019d seen\
  \ the paradoxes played out in real life. I\u2019d driven the long boulevards, flat,\
  \ wide, and perfect for biking, yet un-bikable due to poor lighting and fast cars.\
  \ I\u2019d seen people from all walks of life, diverse yet equalized because, ultimately,\
  \ it\u2019s the commonality of money that talks. I\u2019d meandered from hotel to\
  \ hotel, an apparent dazzle of architecture and themes but owned by the hands of\
  \ a few. It\u2019s a place to pa-pa-pa-pa-partayyyy, to work, to seek your fortune.\
  \ It\u2019s a slice of America, a whisper of the American dream."
