Text: "\u201CWhere exactly are we going, again?\u201D I asked James as we were leaving\
  \ the Monterrey airport breathing in the slightly sweet mountain air. The taxi cab\
  \ driver, who assured us he accepted credit cards from what I could ascertain in\
  \ my broken Spanish abilities, needed to know where he was taking us. We showed\
  \ the driver the address of our hotel, loaded our bags into the trunk and got into\
  \ the backseat of his compact car. Coming along on this jaunt to Mexico was not\
  \ something I had done much research into, as I\u2019d only had 3 days notice, nor\
  \ had I expected to be so enamoured with the view from my curtained window...the\
  \ sunset\u2019s palette of ombre reds fading into the burnt browns of the clearly\
  \ defined jagged mineral faces visible from the road which was clearly cut from\
  \ the mountains which surrounded us at every turn. Falling rocks were kept from\
  \ their descent with only a thin netting we seemed ought not to become reliant upon.\n\
  \nIt became clear our driver knew where he was driving sooner than either of us.\
  \ Our arrival at the hotel in Saltillo, had taken us nearly an hour and brought\
  \ us into an entirely different state of Mexico, Coahuila, the capital city in which\
  \ I now found myself was not our destination, \u2018or not the one I had intended\
  \ to explore,\u2019 I thought. But, I decided to make the best of my now foreign\
  \ surroundings and my usual train of thought led to explorations of my tastebuds.\n\
  \nThe concierge at our hotel advised some of the American-style restaurants on premises\
  \ would be close and very safe, but I had been surprised when I had seen signs for\
  \ local breweries upon our drive into the city. I asked if she thought those might\
  \ be of interest, which she replied, \u201CMost of our guests aren\u2019t looking\
  \ for local spots,\u201D referring to the automotive industry influence in the entire\
  \ region, \u201Cone is just down the road with burgers and locally brewed beers.\
  \ Just don\u2019t drink anything with ice or unfiltered water.\u201D \n\nGuidelines\
  \ in mind and destination set, we woke up the next morning and set off on foot.\
  \ Saltillo is a mountainous desert city and winds often become the main source of\
  \ worry when one has prepared for the heat of the sun. The wind had picked up on\
  \ the first half of our trek and the inexact nature of our destination resulted\
  \ in a few wrong turns hoping to catch sight of that sign I had seen to guide us.\
  \ There it was flapping audibly, bright white and navy blue in the sun, \u201CBREWERY\
  \ TURN HERE.\u201D We only faced the challenge of crossing the elevated pedestrian\
  \ bridge across the 6-lane highway lined with car dealerships, empty buildings,\
  \ billboards advertising fast food, and passing clouds of dust between us and local\
  \ gastronomic delights.\n\nI bounded down the formerly grassy barrier to come up\
  \ looking southwardly at the narrow grey concrete ramp with shoulder-height rails\
  \ which went upwards at what seemed a steeper than usual angle. It was a new and\
  \ very secure looking, like a bunker\u2026 I thought as I continued skyward. The\
  \ wind hit me forcefully as I reached the final catwalk, full of the dust and grit\
  \ fallen from the factory stacks I could see for miles, as it found its way through\
  \ the steel which suspended us above the cars whizzing by on the roadway below.\n\
  \nAided by the steep grade of the mirrored ramp, we quickly found ourselves not\
  \ more than 15 steps away standing in front of the Cerveceria Huerfana. From the\
  \ road, it looked like any other stripmall. But through the doors, we were invited\
  \ to a view of greyed wood paneling an open air but sheltered-from-the-sun space\
  \ filled with bright light from the patio full of steel frame furniture in a pleasing\
  \ but not memorable aesthetic; but mostly, the smell of grass-fed burgers cooking\
  \ mixed with the faintest hint of fermentation. \n\nThe clearest sign we had found\
  \ the place was hung above the myriad of taps, chalked in pithy names with percentages,\
  \ IBUs and pairings enticing us to take just one more unexpected flight."
