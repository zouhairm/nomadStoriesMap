Text: "What comes to your mind when someone mentions Sri Lanka casually? A tear-drop?\
  \ Cricket? Tamil Tigers? Jayasuriya? Sangakarra? Pretty much the same for me, except\
  \ that all this was towered by the presence of a friend\u2019s uncle in the country,\
  \ who had extended invitations to us to visit the country. The plans made in the\
  \ dark and full-of-terror nights of house job ultimately fell prey to procrastination.\
  \ But, eventually, desperation triumphed. Landing a job you want to take-off from,\
  \ taking a lot of exams and awaiting the results of just as many has its way of\
  \ warping your head. The next thing I knew, I was off with a friend to Sri Lanka,\
  \ the pretty islandcountry in the heart of the Indian Ocean. Before I take you to\
  \ visit Lanka with me, here\u2019s a little thank you note to people who made it\
  \ possible. Ikram Zeb Khan, for injecting this crazy idea into my head, and for\
  \ being an infectiously crazy person generally. Haroon Ashraf, for taking the call\
  \ and agreeing to this trip on the go (How do you do this, man? I need ten months\
  \ to understand a thing, and another twelve for planning).\nNayela Naviz, partly\
  \ for who she is (half Sri Lankan) and partly for what she did (helped us with the\
  \ visa process). And since I\u2019ve been tricked into the mood already, let me\
  \ take it out of my system by doing something I\u2019ve never done before. Thanking\
  \ my parents, for loving me enough to let me go. Anytime, anywhere!\nP.S: The line\
  \ was Arundhati Roy\u2019s, but the feelings were mine.\nP.P.S: My dad did look\
  \ down upon Lanka and then on me, but anyway.\nAs you land in, pronunciations aside,\
  \ the Bandaranaike Airport, a little off the capital Colombo, the acreage of the\
  \ coconut trees and tropical climate welcomes you to the country. The capital is\
  \ like any other metropolitan centre, and we entered it amidst the constant complaints\
  \ of our driver on its bad traffic. \u201CIs this what you call bad traffic?\u201D\
  \ my Abbottabad and Lahore genes asked in unison, looking at the mildly congested\
  \ roads and cars following their lanes. \u201CSweet!\u201D We later came to know\
  \ that a reason for following traffic rules might be the heavy fines imposed for\
  \ not following them. In a country that passes for generally being quite cheap,\
  \ 30,000 Sri Lankan rupees (roughly 21,000 of ours) for not wearing a passenger\
  \ seat-belt! Heck, here they chalan us for 500 rupees for driver\u2019s belt and\
  \ we\u2019re still trying out ways to get around that! After we had checked in to\
  \ our hotel, having canvassed through the breadth of the city, there it was: the\
  \ horror. The more things change, the more they remain the same. A Lankan daily\
  \ looked me in the eye, with the header declaring the upsurge of dengue cases in\
  \ the country. The ghosts of my medicine ward had decided to accompany me across\
  \ the seas. Not being in the mood from giving dengue treatment in one country to\
  \ getting it in another, I coated myself with ample mosquito repellant before we\
  \ went to walk through the city. When we returned, we had met many polite Lankans,\
  \ and experienced a lovely downpour, so things started looking up. They especially\
  \ looked up when we had rested and eaten; fresh as energiser bunnies the next day\
  \ to embark upon an adventurous voyage. I was surprised to the point of skepticism\
  \ when the immigration authorities in Colombo took quite a while to scrutinise the\
  \ papers of the white couple before me, but passed me in a minute with a smile.\
  \ \u201CPakistani? Here for visiting? Enjoy your stay!\u201D Where are those fabled\
  \ \u201Cgreen passport\u201D insults, I wondered. I consoled myself they were to\
  \ come later. They never did. Every person who came to know we were Pakistani was\
  \ very cordial to us. It will be very unfortunate if it lands into another conundrum\
  \ after battling one for so long. There are way better places for sure, but this\
  \ place has its way of growing upon you and becoming yours. For all the experiences,\
  \ memories and endearing recollections of the same, I\u2019m very grateful to the\
  \ country and its people."
