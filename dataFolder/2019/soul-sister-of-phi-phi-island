Text: "It was the spring of 2006 and as a 22 year old transgender woman, I was feeling\
  \ equally fearful as I was excited. I had my suitcase packed, my passport ready\
  \ and a one way ticket bound for London via Thailand! \n\nI had never been overseas\
  \ before and my best friend Beau and I had just arrived at Sydney International\
  \ Airport. We were thrilled for the adventure ahead and I knew this would be the\
  \ trip of a lifetime. We said goodbye to our friends, dropped off our bags and boarded\
  \ the plane. Deep breathe girl, first stop Bangkok! \n\nWe landed in Bangkok 10\
  \ hours later and I was in awe of the lights, hustle and bustle, Thai culture and\
  \ adoring people. I was drawn to the Kathoey (also known as ladyboys in western\
  \ culture) of Khao San Road and was humoured and shocked when they pointed at the\
  \ tall blonde girl (me) and cheekily screeched \u201Csame same, same same!\u201D\
  \ Beau and I couldn\u2019t help but laugh as we made our way to our hotel through\
  \ the crowd of this humid, polluted, overcrowded and completely spellbinding city\
  \ that was Bangkok. \n\nAfter 4 days in Bangkok we travelled further south and discovered\
  \ the tranquillity of Phi Phi Island. The majority of South East Asia were still\
  \ recovering from the 2014 Boxing Day Tsunami, which was apparent as the tidemarks\
  \ lined the cliff tops above the piles of debris covered landscape below.  This\
  \ visual clearly resembling the natural disaster of recent times, however the trained\
  \ welcoming smiles shaded any doubt in newly travellers as we were welcomed by staff\
  \ with a Pina Colada and a key to our bungalow. \n\nWaking up to the crashing waves\
  \ of the Andaman Sea was a peaceful alarm to tell us it was time to awaken and replenish\
  \ for the day ahead. Beau and I head to breakfast and were slowly approached by\
  \ a tall, slender, flat chested girl with chalked on black eyebrows and wispy long,\
  \ dark hair. \n\nAs the girl drew closer, I heard the words of the Bangkok Kathoey\
  \ repeat in my head \u201Csame same, same same\u201D. Our waitress introduced herself\
  \ as \u201CIce\u201D in a deep husky voice and like the Kathoey of Bangkok, I could\
  \ see she had also realised that this blonde girl was just like her, relief. \n\n\
  Ice and I connected immediately. We spoke of our cultural differences, struggles\
  \ as transgender women and future aspirations. I told Ice that I was a hairdresser\
  \ and I was planning on getting work in London. I could see Ice\u2019s excitement\
  \ as she had not cut her hair in quite a while. \n\nAs a gesture to Ice\u2019s hospitality,\
  \ friendly demeanour and polite nature, I offered to give Ice a haircut. Ice humbly\
  \ and eagerly accepted my offer and although I could tell this was probably not\
  \ customarily acceptable, she was clearly enthusiastic and I was more than willing\
  \ to help a sister in need. \n\nLater that afternoon, Ice invited myself and Beau\
  \ to her hut in the mountains. We walked up a steep hill in the dawning sun, scissors\
  \ in hand while Ice and her friend giggled at their mischievous behaviour. Once\
  \ we got to the hut we were welcomed with tea and broken conversation while I cut\
  \ Ice\u2019s hair into a long bob, just beneath the collar bone. I handed Ice a\
  \ nearby handheld mirror and she was thrilled with the result. \n\nAs a thank you,\
  \ Ice offered to take us to party that evening. We met later that evening and trekked\
  \ through the jungle to a secluded beach hut, covered in fairy lights and greeted\
  \ by friendly party goers gathered around a bon fire upon the shoreline. \n\nAs\
  \ we danced in the moonlight, laughing and carefree, I realised that the most precious\
  \ moments are the ones that are unpredictable, spontaneous and connected just like\
  \ the one I was sharing with Ice in this very moment, my soul sister of Phi Phi\
  \ Island."
