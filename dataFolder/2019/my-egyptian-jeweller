Text: "Hot. 47 degrees hot. The kind of hot that makes you sticky with every step,\
  \ and no amount of bottled water can cool you down. Location: Cairo, Egypt. Season:\
  \ the dead middle of summer. Sporting a loose, long-sleeve tee and a blue skirt\
  \ that falls past my knees in order to remain conservative, I trudge through the\
  \ crowded marketplace in search of juice, some water, or a bit of shade to take\
  \ refuge from the sun. \n\n\u201CWelcome to my country\u201D. \n\nAmongst the screams\
  \ and yells in Arabic, the muted words in English were the loudest to me. \n\n\u201C\
  Where do you come from Miss?\u201D\n\nNestled between the tea maker and an oil shop\
  \ was a furrow-browed man with soft eyes and calloused hands. He sat behind a carefully\
  \ set up table of silver-plated rings. \n\n\u201CAustralia\u201D\n\u201CAh, land\
  \ of the kangaroo\u201D. \n\nAnywhere I visit in the world and mention my ethnicity,\
  \ kangaroos are spoken about without fail. That, and my apparent inherent ability\
  \ to know how to surf. I am always too embarrassed to declare that I have never\
  \ actually seen a kangaroo in the wild, and the combined fact that living extremely\
  \ far from the beach and lacking any kind of balance prohibits me from being an\
  \ adequate surfer. \n\n\u201CHave not seen tourist in very long time. Please, I\
  \ hope you enjoy my country\u201D.\n\nIn 2010, the number of visitors to Egypt was\
  \ at 14.7 million, an all-time high. However, since the Arab Springs protests in\
  \ 2011, Egypt\u2019s tourism industry took a huge hit due to political instability.\
  \ In 2015, a charted Russian plane crashed in the Sinai Peninsula in an alleged\
  \ terrorist attack, and with it, the number of tourists fell to its lowest: 4.8\
  \ million. \n\n\u201CCome. Look what I offer. I have not made a sale all week\u201D\
  . \n\nMy empathy kicks in and I move a step closer. One large stone in particular\
  \ grips me.  \n\n\u201CFrom Yemen this stone. Smuggled across the border by a Syrian\
  \ refugee all the way to Egypt.\u201D \n\nTrue or false, his marketing pitch inevitably\
  \ rose a degree of intrigue. Who was the refugee? Where did he find the stone? How\
  \ on earth did it get to you? His gesture for me to try it on keeps me silent. It\
  \ is far too big. I begin to politely decline and scramble for ideas on how to get\
  \ myself out of this situation without having to pay for a ring that I will never\
  \ wear. He knows what I\u2019m thinking. \n\n\u201CI am jeweller! You really want\
  \ it, I make it fit you\u201D. \n\nI did want it. He speaks to his stall neighbour.\
  \ I assume to ask him to man the shop while he is gone, and then leads me to his\
  \ work station. The tools look ancient and barely usable, but his steady hands slice\
  \ the ring in half, shave down the width, reattach the parts, and polish it up.\n\
  \nWe exchange money and the item. A cheeky grin. He puts his number in my phone\
  \ and records the contact as \u2018My Egyptian Jeweller\u2019. \n\nI leave with\
  \ a new friend, a ring, and promises to tell all I meet how grand a country Egypt\
  \ is to visit."
