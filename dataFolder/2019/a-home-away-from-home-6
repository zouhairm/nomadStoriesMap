Text: "I had a love affair with a small town in Switzerland eleven years ago. My heart\
  \ still yearns for the town of Interlaken, a place that stole my heart during my\
  \ first backpacking trip in 2008. A whimsical summer romance, twenty days of staying\
  \ in one single hostel. I grew close with the staff and the many travelers that\
  \ came and gone every day. A makeshift family so to speak, I promised I'd come back\
  \ to work and live there one day. I worked hard through college and figured out\
  \ that I was able to obtain an European passport through my Italian lineage. Six\
  \ years worth of research and paperwork, I was granted my EU passport. I'd sit in\
  \ my college classes doodling in my notebooks, \"Europe\", \"Switzerland\", \"I\
  \ love Switzerland\", it'd put me in such a daze that I could feel like I was backpacking\
  \ again. If I could vision it, I knew I could make it happen. \n\nAfter graduation,\
  \ I chose to book a one way ticket, with no plan of having a job or a place to stay.\
  \ I chose to fly on the act of faith, I hadn't seen these people in six years. I\
  \ wasn't sure if they would they remember me or if I'd make it. People thought I\
  \ was out of my mind but I've been told, \"leap and the world will throw you a net.\"\
  \ This was my first time traveling solo, I was used to having a partner and it scared\
  \ me. How was I going to do this? Am I crazy for doing this? I took the same bus,\
  \ I took six years ago, I sat and pulled out my old room keys I kept in my wallet\
  \ as determination to go back. I walked into the front lobby, it still had the same\
  \ old look to it. I didn't recognize the new guy they hired, but I asked if it was\
  \ possible I could stay in the same room I had. To my luck, it was available. I\
  \ slid my card to open the door and a flush of emotions came over me. It was like\
  \ I went back in time, I could see all my roommates and the bed I originally slept\
  \ in. The window sill, I sat on to write in my travel journal about how I couldn't\
  \ leave this place. Joyous tears ran down my face, I quickly gathered myself and\
  \ went to find the staff around back. \n\nI remembered the night before I left to\
  \ go back home to the states, I was sharing a beer with the manager Roger and I\
  \ told him how much I love it here and want to work here. He said, \"You can. Get\
  \ your EU passport and you'll have a job.\" \n\nI said, \"Roger? It's me Laura,\
  \ I'm not sure if you remember me, I told you I'd come back.\"  Before I could finish\
  \ explaining who I was, he immediately remembered me and gave me the biggest hug.\
  \ He offered me a job and a place to stay. My room faced the beautiful Jungfrau\
  \ region of the Swiss Alps, pristine lush greenery could be seen for miles, I could\
  \ even see the snowcaps on the mountains, I felt like I was living inside of a postcard.\
  \ Unsure of what was to come, I had to pinch myself to make myself realize I was\
  \ back home. Despite not knowing the language and trying to figure out how I would\
  \ stay there long term, I trusted that I was in the right place. Things were not\
  \ the same as they were back when I first traveled there. It seemed run down, it\
  \ wasn't lively anymore. Roger said, \"It hasn't been the same since that Summer\
  \ of 2008.\" I wanted to bring the hostel back to what I know it can be. It turned\
  \ out to be more difficult than I thought. Maybe, that summer was a time that could\
  \ never come back, a memory lost in time. It's been five years since I left Switzerland\
  \ and there will always be a pang in my stomach that wishes to be back, like wanting\
  \ to hug your mother when you're sick; homesick."
