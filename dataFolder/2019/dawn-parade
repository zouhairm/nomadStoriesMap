Text: "DAWN PARADE\n\n\n\tI emerge from the darkness of the park beneath the redwood\
  \ trees and step out onto the lake shore. Even in the pre-dawn hours, there is always\
  \ a plethora of photographers huddled in the curve of Roy's Bay, stalking #thatwanakatree\
  \ in the mist. Roots surrounded by water unless the dam gates open and the Clutha\
  \ floods, the lonesome willow still stands long after history might have claimed\
  \ it. The camera crowd cluster together facing the water, unified by a singular\
  \ purpose, and I wonder how far they have traveled in order to arrive here, on this\
  \ day at this precise time. Do they know what this twenty-fifth day of April represents?\
  \ From the log cabin which faces west, I make out the fierce strains of a lone bagpipe,\
  \ calling a crowd to assemble. \n\nI leave the photographers behind as my boots\
  \ scrunch over the small rocks and worn pebbles that line the lake, left by retreating\
  \ glaciers millennia ago. I make my way towards the township\u2019s foreshore, disturbing\
  \ a gaggle of ducks as I pass by, and they take to the air from rocky perches and\
  \ swoop to land on the water\u2019s surface. Ahead I can see the soldiers trooping\
  \ onto the small hillock near the willow trees, and the sleepy crowd falls silent\
  \ as the first rays of sunrise frame the edge of Mt Iron.\n\nSuddenly I hear it.\
  \ The clear tones of a solitary man singing. First, the Australian national anthem\
  \ followed by our New Zealand anthem, sung in te reo M\u0101ori and then in English.\
  \ I come to a halt on the shore, standing a little way off from the service, pulling\
  \ off my woollen beanie and coming to attention to bow my head and listen, tears\
  \ rolling down cheeks pink with frost.\n\nI think then of my Australian grandfather\
  \ \u2013 James Cemp Ewing, 7th Reinforcements, 11th Australian Light Horse Regiment\
  \ \u2013 lying now at peace among fallen comrades, with the smell of war and the\
  \ dirt of trenches still beneath his fingernails, dust of the Heliopolis desert\
  \ clogging his nostrils, the fragment of shrapnel still lodged in his thigh. He\
  \ carried it home with him on the troop ship, his badge of honor shadowing him in\
  \ pain for the rest of his life, and they buried his bravery with his body. I think\
  \ of him, limping around the ranch, smiling sternly through all those years he raised\
  \ my mother as his own child; the daughter of another soldier, Robert Leonard Twemlow.\
  \ I can imagine them now, cantering their horses around the heavens together, wind\
  \ dashing through their hair and the glow of freedom in their young eyes.\n\nMum\
  \ didn\u2019t know about her parentage until she applied for a passport, the year\
  \ they first required documents for trans-Tasman travel. Her roots were covered\
  \ with murky water, and it took a long time to swim beneath, looking for truth.\
  \ My grandmother carried the family secrets with her when she passed, so Mum spent\
  \ the last of her seventy-two years searching for her biological father.  A transparent\
  \ ghost, an empty limb on the family tree; the only evidence a black-and-white portrait\
  \ in the ANZAC archives.\n\nA single bugle cuts the air, and the heavy flags of\
  \ our two countries \u2013 blues and whites and reds, stars woven together with\
  \ the blood of many \u2013 are slowly lowered as the haunting notes of The Last\
  \ Post ring true. The steps of the attendant soldiers die away, and all that is\
  \ left behind are poppy wreaths and green garlands adorning the memorial stone.\
  \ The remaining crowd \u2013 the mayor, the schoolchildren and teachers, the parents,\
  \ the tourists and the curious backpackers \u2013 all trickle away to the coffee\
  \ shops and breakfast.\n\nTurning southward, I leave the township behind me, cool\
  \ sun at my back, and follow the curve of the lake once more, scattering ducks in\
  \ my wake. When I reach the graceful willow, its swooning branches beckon me. Ignoring\
  \ the cluster of cameras, I step carefully over the wet roots and reach softly around\
  \ the trunk. Its girth reminds me of my gentle gruff grandfather, and I squeeze\
  \ my arms a little tighter in a farewell hug. \n\nI remember him. I will not forget."
