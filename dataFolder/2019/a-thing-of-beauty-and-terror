Text: "The wooden boat sways gently under my feet as I purchase for balance. It\u2019\
  s handmade with bright colorful mosaics adorning its frame, similar to those found\
  \ on trucks across Pakistan\u2019s highways. Three more people hop in, while our\
  \ guide patiently gazes on. His face is weathered, deep lines giving him a gaunt\
  \ look, his eyes misting over from time to time. Once everyone is on board we set\
  \ sail. I take in my surroundings, the chaos of the past few days trekking through\
  \ Hunza in stark contrast to this strange halcyon silo. As our guide starts speaking,\
  \ I\u2019m hoping for some commentary on the beauty of the landscape peppered with\
  \ local legends. I wait for tales of romance, of jinns and fairies, and lovers reunited\
  \ in the vicinity of the lake\u2019s magical waters and high sierra. \n\nThere are\
  \ no romantic stories to recommend Attabad lake, however. Rather stories of loss,\
  \ of nature\u2019s warnings, of human negligence. It is a thing of beauty but also\
  \ terror. \n\nOn January 4, 2010, a catastrophic landslide led to the destruction\
  \ of Attabad village in the Hunza valley. The initial impact of the landslide severed\
  \ road ties between the small communities and the rest of the country. But that\
  \ wasn\u2019t all. More than 1600 people became homeless in the blink of an eye\
  \ and more than twenty people lost their lives. In the wake of the disaster, rescue\
  \ teams were mobilized to relocate those affected. People were moved to makeshift\
  \ camps, their future a terrible question mark, a blip in the horizon. \n\nThe aftermath\
  \ of the landslide birthed this lake that now tourists from all over the world visit.\
  \ Inspired by its Instagram worthy grandeur, tourists flock here to take rides on\
  \ the lake\u2019s many boats and snap photos. It\u2019s hard not to fall in love\
  \ with the picturesque lake. Surrounded by majestic mountains on all sides, a play\
  \ between light and shadow, its turquoise water a stunning vista. \n\nBut beholding\
  \ the beauty of the lake, I am also reminded of the sublimity of nature. I had seen\
  \ pictures of the lake before, of course. The vast expanse of the clear, beautifully\
  \ tinged water as far as the eye could see while we floated on the ruins of people\
  \ who came before us. The threat of the lake bursting and causing unimaginable flooding\
  \ still hovers in the distance. I wonder how many destroyed homes are we currently\
  \ embanked on, of ruined hopes and dreams. If I walk through would I be walking\
  \ over graves?\n\nBut perhaps that is how places function, how lives are lived,\
  \ how homes are built and lost. How easy it is to get attached to the idea of a\
  \ place, to greedily consume its aesthetic, while forgetting the terrible loss and\
  \ heartache associated with it. In the end, we make our own meanings. Perhaps we\
  \ are all loops, careening in the same nooks, and we substitute feelings more than\
  \ we let on. \n\nI went to Hunza seeking adventure. Terrifying jeep rides as tires\
  \ barely hover on narrow winding roads, trekking to basecamps looking for elusive\
  \ mountains, the rush of life mediating with tranquility only achievable at high\
  \ altitudes.  \n\nWhat I found instead was pockets of silence nestled in between\
  \ the movement of life. \n\nWe end our boat ride near a submerged building. It peeks\
  \ through the enchanting water, desolate in its stasis. There\u2019s a network of\
  \ roads nearby, also sunken, the last remaining witness. The sun will set soon.\
  \ In the distance, I can see a group of Chinese tourists armed with selfie sticks\
  \ climb down to where the boats are moored. A hover of trout swims past us as we\
  \ exit the boat, dwellers of a space that would never be the same."
