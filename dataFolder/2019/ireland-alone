Text: "So at 35 I took my Dream Trip...alone!  I'd never been outside Canada alone,\
  \ and as a woman I was a little terrified.  That's didn't stop me though.  For 16\
  \ days I drove in a foreign country, stayed in 3 castles and explored this beautiful,\
  \ impossibly still green(it was November) land.  \nSome sighs made me weep, the\
  \ cliffs of moher and st Patrick's cathedral.  Walking through centuries old castle\
  \ ruins and graveyards like Glendalough was like stepping back in time.  You could\
  \  Field of history. Places like the Giants Causeway just made you feel insignificant\
  \ and I didn't  know that I really needed to feel insignificant in my own life for\
  \ a little while. I made my way around the country travelling roughly 3000 km on\
  \ roads that were the opposite of what I'm used to.  FINALLY getting the hang of\
  \ those damnable roundabouts!  \nI went all alone and it was so scary that for true\
  \ first few days I wouldn't go outside after dark, but then I grew into my own sense\
  \ of self determination and got to see the sunrise over the River Liffey, the sunset\
  \ over The Sky Road.  I chatted with and shared a bag of crisps with a red spray\
  \ painted sheep on the narrow mountain pass of Connemara national park.  \nI was\
  \ my own Galway girl watching street musicicians with voices that SHOULD be on the\
  \ radio.  \nI turned 35 in Ardmore, a place I'd read of in my favourite books for\
  \ 21 years.  I was magic that day as I traced the footsteps of my favourite literary\
  \ heroines. There I sampled the best damn calamari I've ever had...and I'm a chef!\
  \ \nThe one thing that still baffles me is the lighting.  The natural light makes\
  \ Ireland abphotographers dream.  Cloudy, misty, and sunny all at once!  And during\
  \ these times it seems as if the rays of light only touch what's oldest, most precious,\
  \ what holds most history.\nI walked the hill of Tara and FELT Amy foremothers walking\
  \ besided me.  Whispering their ways, their history, thier secrets.  \nI squeezed\
  \ myself into the central chamber of Newgrange and marveled at the 5000 year old\
  \ structure which has never let a drop of water in.  \nI tested my will at the Carreick-a-rede\
  \ rope bridge and I WON!\nI was a shameless flirt with a cutie in a suit of armour\
  \ in my first castle.  He was interested at all, had a heart of iron I guess \U0001F602\
  . \nI spent two nights alone in a castle tower with a narrow circular staircase\
  \ where I was a queen.  Drinking coffee on a turret, reading a first edition lord\
  \ Byron.  \n I chatted with an 3000 year old Egyptian princess in ulster museum.\
  \  \nI befriended deer and ravens in Phoenix park. \nThis was the tip of my iceberg.\
  \  My fear or being and traveling alone ended in Ireland.  I found a strength in\
  \ exploring that inexplicably verdant country that I didn't know I possessed.  \n\
  I know I can do more, will do more, want to do and see more."
