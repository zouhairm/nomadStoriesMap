Text: "I woke with a start. The eloquent phrase \u201Cuh oh\u201D fluttered through\
  \ my tired brain.  We had made the high altitude hike up and over Dead Woman\u2019\
  s Pass that day. We all felt triumphant and in awe of the mountains that hugged\
  \ our view.  Now, around three A.M., I felt a cold panic. I scrambled out of my\
  \ sleeping bag as quietly as one could be expected to be whilst emerging from a\
  \ zippered cocoon.  The ultimate tent debate quickly happened in my mind; to unzip\
  \ ever so slowly or grab and quickly open the flap like ripping off a Band-Aid.\
  \  Our neighbouring tents were less than a few feet away; they were going to hear\
  \ the noise either way.  Hopefully they were all too tired from our trek to be woken\
  \ up. \nI went to exit the tent but the bottom of both doors had been pinned down\
  \ instead of just one.  Without any choice I wiggled through the zippered slit,\
  \ like I was being birthed.  Luckily the moon was bright, as I had an obstacle course\
  \ of tent lines, stairs, and a rock path to the bathroom-such as it was.   \nI had\
  \ practiced squat toilets over the previous couple days, so I was basically a pro.\
  \  As my body purged itself of everything I had eaten that day I enjoyed the simple\
  \ views of my commode.  Moonlight made its silvery way through the square hole in\
  \ the wall.  Thankfully it did not reach the corners, so I could pretend there were\
  \ no Peruvian creepy crawlers accompanying my mid-night adventure.  If I was at\
  \ home, I would have curled up around the toilet; save myself a trip later.  As\
  \ it was, I did not want to fully think about what was on the bottom of my shoes,\
  \ so I pulled myself together and started my journey back to my makeshift bed. \
  \ \nShivering from cold and feeling weak, I rummaged like a mouse through my bag\
  \ to hunt down the pills I had brought just in case this happened. I am nothing\
  \ if not prepared while travelling. I added my toque to my night attire and hunkered\
  \ down in my sleeping bag, willing the pills to start their job.\nOn the way back\
  \ from my second trip to our distant facilities, I stopped on the bridge that led\
  \ across a river.  The water washed over grey stones, making perfect stream noises.\
  \  The air was fresh and clean, if not a touch chilly.  An assemblage of travelers\
  \ slumbered upon the hill to my right, but I was so peacefully alone in the dark.\
  \ I stood, hands on the railing to steady myself, and appreciated this wonderfully\
  \ meditative space before returning once again to bed.\nI woke the next morning\
  \ wondering if I could call in sick to our hike that day; rain check anyone?  Feeling\
  \ like I did, I would normally hype myself up to make the trek from bed to couch.\
  \  Today the distance between bed and couch was sixteen kilometers, up and down\
  \ mountains.  The sounds of our camp being packed up made me hide deeper in my sleeping\
  \ bag.  Bless our porters, as they adapted their schedule to leave my tent until\
  \ the very last moment.\nThe start to our day\u2019s hike was a very nauseous climb\
  \ that felt as if we were aiming for the clouds.  Private facilities are few and\
  \ far between along the Inca Trail.  I just kept putting one foot in front of the\
  \ other pleading with my stomach to calm down.  I was propelled along by Dory the\
  \ fish\u2019s famous mantra and the support of our travel companions.  Within the\
  \ past couple weeks we had quickly become a strong support group.  Exploring new\
  \ places, sharing stories and experiencing a beautiful country and its history brings\
  \ people from different backgrounds together in such a natural way.\nI can\u2019\
  t see that I will ever have the opportunity again to vomit while kneeling beside\
  \ ancient ruins, looking at clouds rolling around magnificent mountains that dipped\
  \ into stunning valleys.  I would never trade this life experience for staying home.\
  \   My lived wisdom to others is this, \u201CTravel prepared, but travel none the\
  \ less. And just keep swimming.\u201D"
