Text: "It\u2019s hard to love something you don\u2019t know. Although I was born in\
  \ Sabah, I never had an affinity for it. I spoke with a Peninsular accent. I\u2019\
  d grown up in a suburb of Kuala Lumpur, a near three-hour flight away in Peninsular\
  \ Malaysia.\n\nI may as well have grown up in a foreign country.\n\nWhen I was 6\
  \ or 7, my father took us on holiday to Mount Kinabalu \u2013 it\u2019s the veritable\
  \ symbol of Sabah. Local belief is that the souls of our ancestors resided in the\
  \ mountain. From a young age, I\u2019d observed the attachment that my father (and\
  \ many Sabahans) had to the land, but I never quite understood it. \n\nAt 19, I\
  \ went back. My brother and I had decided to make the 2 hour drive up to the mountain\
  \ from the state capital of Kota Kinabalu. The scenery on the drive up was\u2026\
  unremarkable, to say the least. There was foliage thick enough to hide a body on\
  \ one side and a steep drop on the other. For some excitement, there are stretches\
  \ of road without crash barriers, so you can experience the tingles resulting from\
  \ the slight anxiety induced by the sheer drop on the other side. One sharp turn\
  \ of your wheel and \u2013\n\nI was not keen to experience the drive down. And as\
  \ luck would have it, on our drive back, it started to rain. My brain blared alarms:\
  \ DEATH TRAP X2. So we stopped at a rest house, figuring that we\u2019d wait out\
  \ the rain. \n\nThe sky was grey, the air was wet. A little old Dusun lady came\
  \ to ask us if we wanted anything to eat. We were the only customers there, so we\
  \ made small talk. Amidst the conversation she said, \u201CDi Kinabalu ada emas.\u201D\
  \ There is gold in Kinabalu. I widened my eyes, raised both eyebrows, feigned surprise.\
  \ It was just an old wives\u2019 tale. \u201CReally?\u201D I asked in my Peninsular\
  \ accent. She nodded knowingly. \u201COnly Sabahans can see it,\u201D she said.\n\
  \nWe must\u2019ve been at that rest house at least an hour. It was still raining,\
  \ but the sun was beginning to set. I hustled my brother back into the car \u2013\
  \ night time drives down a mountain road with little to no streetlamps is more perilous\
  \ than wet asphalt.\n\nMy view on the drive down was, yet again, foliage and asphalt\
  \ \u2013 typical for this mountainous region of Sabah. I wasn\u2019t paying much\
  \ attention when my brother said, \u201CLook.\u201D I turned to my left, all I saw\
  \ was him and rows of trees beyond him. I scrunched my forehead \u2013 look at what?\
  \ He clicked his tongue in annoyance. I\u2019d missed something. \n\nThen again,\
  \ \u201CLook.\u201D\n\nAnd this time there were no trees, no crash barrier. We were\
  \ driving maybe two feet away from the edge of the carved mountainside. I should\u2019\
  ve panicked. But instead, I vaguely registered that my brother had slowed the car\
  \ down, and then at some point, he pulled over to the side of the road and stopped\
  \ it completely.\n\nBefore me was a sea of gold \u2013 or, more accurately, a valley\
  \ filled with trees as far as the eye could see, awash with the golden light of\
  \ the setting sun. In the rearview mirror, I could see a mountain peak. The drizzling\
  \ rain softened the glow of the setting sun, such that the light looked liquid on\
  \ the mountain fa\xE7ade. \n\nThough I\u2019d never before been able to pick Mount\
  \ Kinabalu\u2019s peak from the various others that blended together along the drive,\
  \ my heart moved and was sure that that was Aki Nabalu \u2013 \u201Cancestor\u2019\
  s mountain\u201D.\n\nMy heart moved again. \u201CThere is gold in Kinabalu. Only\
  \ Sabahans can see it.\u201D\n\nI had never before understood the tie that my father\
  \ had to this land, but sitting in that car, in the shadow of my ancestors, they\
  \ whispered to my heart, \u201CThis is home.\u201D\n\nI spoke with a Peninsular\
  \ accent, and I\u2019d grown up in Peninsular Malaysia. I may as well have grown\
  \ up in a foreign country. \n\nBut I was not foreign. I was a Sabahan."
