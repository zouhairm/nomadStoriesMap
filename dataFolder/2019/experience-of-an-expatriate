Text: "I was a Nursing Student in Nigeria until failures and disappointments set in.\
  \ We found out to have been admitted into an unaccredited program. So i decided\
  \ to relocate to South Africa where i could complete my study. I made preparations,\
  \ obtained a visa, contacted someone in Pretoria with applications made to a university.\n\
  \nI arrived South Africa and it is beautiful country with diverse of cultures. Whites\
  \ and Blacks dominated. The whites were said to have immigrated from Europe while\
  \ the Blacks are the local residents. Surprisingly, there's a line drawn between\
  \ both races. The margin was obvious in every corners of the country. This would\
  \ be a story for another day.\nAfter a long time, I was admitted to study Biomedical\
  \ Sciences at the University of South Africa. \n\nI thought life would be better.\
  \ I met friends who had lured me in peddling drugs but i declined their advice.\
  \ One Christmas, i was alone and bored. I was working as a security guard in a complex.\
  \ That was the job i could get in order to fend for myself. I regretted why i left\
  \ my country as i would never be a guard back home. I had no cents, no friends,\
  \ no relatives, no one in my new country of abode. A resident in the complex where\
  \ i was guarding sent his son, Philip to offer me a plate of food. I was so joyful.\
  \ It was a plate of rice, Broccoli, Chicken and Mayonnaise. With Joy and tears rolling\
  \ down my face, i almost wiped the plate with my tongue. It was the first good meal\
  \ i had after nine months in South Africa.\n\nAlong the line, she would check on\
  \ me and rendered help in whatever way she could. I was transferred back to Pretoria,\
  \ where i worked for about three months before i swap jobs.\n\nLife is Pretoria\
  \ was much better than it was in Johannesburg. The locals are busy with their lives\
  \ and had no time to see if anyone was crying or sad. I had to fend for myself anyhow.\
  \ The city is lite with lights at night, a glowing city. On both sides of the roads\
  \ are trees, whose leaves come together at the top, forming a beautiful scene of\
  \ photography. The city is sometimes called Jacaranda City base of this.\n\nAs much\
  \ as there is crime, there is also poverty. Some locals were found sleeping on the\
  \ street, some would eat from the bins. During the day, you'd find them parking\
  \ cars, washing cars, picking bottles for recycling, and some begging for coins.\
  \  Lots of activities are going on in the city.\n\nIt is the residence of the President\
  \ of the country, yet the cost of living is high. \n\nI'm currently Studying and\
  \ taking a gap-year to save up funds. I hope this would afford me the opportunity\
  \ to travel and write stories.\n\nThank you."
