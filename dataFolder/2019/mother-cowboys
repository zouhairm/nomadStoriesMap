Text: "On our last day in Kyrgyzstan, we stop for lunch at the bazaar in Osh. It\u2019\
  s a maze of surprise and delight: endless aisles of dried fruits, knock-off sneakers,\
  \ vintage sewing machines, handmade saddles, dusty electronic parts and diamante-studded\
  \ tracksuits. My friends and I lose ourselves for hours among the stalls of glorious,\
  \ pointless stuff before we finally find the mini manty that we came for.\n\nManty\
  \ is a type of steamed dumpling filled with minced lamb or beef. Kyrgyz manty are\
  \ usually enormous \u2013 two to four times the size of the Chinese dumplings we\u2019\
  re used to \u2013 and filled with minced lamb or beef. But these mini manty are\
  \ dainty little things, more like wontons except that they seem to be filled with\
  \ a combination of potato and cheese. They\u2019re delicious.\n\nWe sit down at\
  \ a shared table and several young women try to strike up a conversation that immediately\
  \ hits a hurdle when they realise that we speak neither Kyrgyz nor Russian. But\
  \ the three of us are used to this by now. We pull out a phone, and ready ourselves\
  \ for the same questions we\u2019ve been asked every day for two weeks.\n\n\u201C\
  Where are you from?\u201D displays the faithful voice translation app.\n\n\u201C\
  USA, Australia, the Netherlands,\u201D we say in turn. \n\nI\u2019ve learned by\
  \ this point that China is not the correct answer to this question, though that\u2019\
  s where we all live. The truth is, when the travelling party is a Chinese-speaking\
  \ white guy, my gender-ambiguous Asian-looking self, and my ethnically ambiguous\
  \ girlfriend (who is biracial-Eurasian not Eurasian-from-Eurasia), there\u2019s\
  \ no easy way to respond to this question, which is really an invitation to explain\
  \ your faces.\n\n\u201CAre you tourists?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes.\u201D\n\n\u201CDo you\
  \ like Kyrgyzstan?\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, it\u2019s beautiful.\u201D We parrot off\
  \ a list of the places we\u2019ve been. I\u2019ve grown to wonder whether the Kyrgyzstan\
  \ tourism bureau pays locals to conduct these impromptu consumer satisfaction surveys\
  \ of every foreign-looking person who passes through. \n\n \u201CHow long have you\
  \ been in Kyrgyzstan?\u201D\n\n\u201CTwo weeks \u2014 we\u2019re crossing the border\
  \ into Uzbekistan tonight.\u201D\n\nThe girls explain that they are Kyrgyz while\
  \ the older women running the shop are Uzbek. We chat a little about Uzbeks in Kyrgyzstan\
  \ and start to feel a little bit successful about how the conversation is progressing.\n\
  \n\u201CMother Cowboys or Butt Sprasivaet?\n\nThe old faithful translation app seems\
  \ to hiccup. The girls repeat their question, pointing to me. We change the language\
  \ from auto-detect to Kyrgyz to Russian. We try voice and type. The app produces\
  \ no intelligible results.\n\n\u201CMother Cowboys or Butt Sprasivaet?\u201D the\
  \ screen continues to display. By now the girls are giggling and whispering, and\
  \ the Uzbek women have joined the conversation. They point at me, then to my girlfriend\
  \ J, then to our male friend K. Some of the girls blush, while another keeps typing,\
  \ rephrasing her words to no avail. She gestures to our hands and points to her\
  \ own ring.\n\nK thinks that they want to know what our relationships are to one\
  \ another. We tell the women that we are not married. They shake their heads \u2014\
  \ that wasn\u2019t the question. \n\n\u201CAna girl or boy asks,\u201D the app offers.\
  \ I think they\u2019re trying to guess my gender. I\u2019m right.\n\nI tell them\
  \ I\u2019m neither. I don\u2019t know how to say that I\u2019m full in Kyrgyz, let\
  \ alone that I\u2019m genderqueer. But months later, I still glow when I think of\
  \ the new gender I picked up on that trip. \n\n\u201COh, I\u2019m not a boy or a\
  \ girl,\u201D I imagine myself answering with a polite, helpful smile. \u201CI\u2019\
  m a butt cowboy, mother sprasivaet.\u201D"
