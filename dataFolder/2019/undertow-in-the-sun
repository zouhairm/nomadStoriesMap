Text: "I'd heard the skies were always blue and that a friendly face was on every\
  \ street corner. I'd heard the culture was as rich and the location was cheap, I'd\
  \ heard the food, the drink, the scenery were all worth it. But would Portugal live\
  \ up to the standard set by others?\n\nWhat's not to love about an affordable holiday\
  \ when you have a shoe-string budget to work with, I thought.\n\nWell. \n\nThe Atlantic\
  \ ocean, as I'd later come to find out was a reason. I couldn't fully explain why\
  \ but I was always in love with a body of water bigger than my bath but oceans,\
  \ seas, Lochs, rivers, fisheries, I love just relaxing next to water and watching\
  \ it's rhythm that I felt an affinity towards. I was a good strong swimmer and spotted\
  \ a large cone shaped rock that I fancied swimming around among other wee challenges\
  \ I could spot on the Google map as I scoured Praia De Rocha.\n\nAnd in Praia Da\
  \ Rocha, a very affordable, not to mention stunning location was it. I gazed at\
  \ photos of the beach, I was in love. I couldn't wait. I seen the cliff faces that\
  \ rolled onto the sparkling sand and into the almost tropical waters where I knew\
  \ I'd spend 40% of my holiday. \n\nWe arrived, checked-in and went for a meal but\
  \ as it was late we didn't reach the beach that night so we enjoyed the inland delicacies,\
  \ burgers and beer, hardly a throw away from the Scottish burgers I'd sampled the\
  \ night previous but I was reluctant to dive straight into the Mediterranean diet.\
  \ \n\nThe next day I was like a kid on Christmas. I hurried my wife and daughter\
  \ to get dressed and packed everything we needed for the beach. Over the rise of\
  \ the street I saw the water,  then the sparkling sands that flew off to the east\
  \ where these monumental rock formations laced the cliffs. It was perfect. \n\n\
  Within 5 minutes of being here I was slathered in suntan lotion and bouncing about\
  \ the surf as the ocean provided my 4-year old daughter with ample joy that kept\
  \ us entertained. All the time I was looking further down the beach towards that\
  \ cone rock. As if it were taunting me, I had too. I had to see what this was all\
  \ about. I told my wife that I was away for a swim, and parted.\n\nGoogle maps didn't\
  \ paint the correct picture, perhaps the tide was further in than normal, it looked\
  \ like a healthy challenge but I didn't hesitate for around this cone rock was another\
  \ part of the beach previously unseen, I had to see it.  I waded in knowing I shouldn't\
  \ but I couldn't back down. This was it.\n\nI made it around the cone rock easily\
  \ and explored the other beach for a few minutes before coming back around. \n\n\
  Portugal is stunning but as I waded around I found out it's not too be messed with.\
  \ The tide had came-in a few feet more by the time I was confidently passing the\
  \ rock, suddenly, an undertow bounced off the rock and pulled me out to sea a few\
  \ metres at a time. I began to panic. All my lifeguatd training meant nothing, as\
  \ strong a swimmer as I am, I couldn't beat the undertow. In around a minute I was\
  \ at least 50ft from shore and gaining pace. I was on thr verge of screaming for\
  \ help but with luck I found a sandbar. I was able to touch and dig my feet in as\
  \ I timed the undertow pulling me out, after a minute I was able to judge when it\
  \ would pull me out and stay where I was while swimming a few metres into shore\
  \ inbetween the towing. I made it ashore. Nothing had changed on the beach and no-one\
  \ had even noticed my calm panic while being dragged out. I sat with my wife and\
  \ daughter and promised never to underestimate or confuse beauty with danger again.\n\
  \nThe rest of the holiday was magical and everything was perfect as we strolled\
  \ along the beach night after night. Portugal. Stunning. Scary. Fun."
