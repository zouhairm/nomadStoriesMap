Text: "I found a lovely couple to exchange apartments with at homexchange.com and\
  \ my first big adventure abroad all by myself was really happening! I was so excited\
  \ and pumped up! I spent the first few heady days days exploring favorite haunts\
  \ all over the city. \n\nThen, I hit a day of panic. I could not decide what to\
  \ do. In fact, I felt paralyzed for a whole day just deciding and then changing\
  \ my mind until I exhausted myself. Nobody expected me anywhere, any time and I\
  \ just could not make a decision and had no reason to. I surfed the internet, watched\
  \ movies, ruminated about my life. I did walk around the neighborhood a bit but\
  \ felt lonely, bored and tired of the efforts I had to make speaking my broken,\
  \ touristy French. I came back disappointed in myself, ate the cheese and bread\
  \ I had and drank wine until I went to bed early.\n\nWell, I woke up the next day\
  \ to another beautiful spring day in my cozy neighborhood in the 19th arrondissement\
  \ and had coffee on my balcony listening to birds and the city wake up in Paris.\
  \ It might have been only pride and stubbornness, but I become suddenly determined\
  \ to do what I needed to do to enjoy and appreciate my trip. I needed a strategy.\n\
  \nI needed three things: some structure, connection and to just relax and enjoy!\
  \ Well, the following strategies are what got me unstuck.\n\nFirst, I found a cooking\
  \ class, in English online to schedule. I also signed up for a meet-up at meetup.com:\
  \ \u201CLet\u2019s Practice Our English.\u201D That sounded perfect! I love practicing\
  \ my English! I do it everyday.\n\nSecond, I decided to have a cup a coffee at the\
  \ cafe I liked right on Canal St. Martin every morning and just relax, plan my day\
  \ day and watch the sun reflecting off the water for a bit. I decided to go there\
  \ every morning just for the satisfaction of being a familiar person to the staff\
  \ who greeted me.\n\nMost importantly, I needed to relax into the trip. I didn\u2019\
  t need to be busy or do exciting, big things. I just need to take it in and appreciate\
  \ all the small pleasure: the vibrant spring flowers, the richness of the coffee,\
  \ the hidden gems of quiet picturesque streets with stunning heavy ancient doors\
  \ painted lush colors, the couples picnicking by candlelight right on the bank of\
  \ the Seine... In a sense, I needed to get a little bored and then get to the other\
  \ side of the boredom where your senses open up and you see the city and everyone\
  \ and everything in a whole new light. I found an English bookstore and stocked\
  \ up on books so I could just relax, read and make myself at home wherever I found\
  \ myself in the city.\n\nI fell in love with the Parc du Buttes Chaumant and my\
  \ neighborhood in the 19th arrondissement. There was a nearby farmers market on\
  \ two days a week and I found the best bakery and fromagerie in the neighborhood\
  \ (the ones that always had the lines). I regularly took  sandwiches to picnic in\
  \ the parc and admire the glorious spring flowers. In fact, I went crazy for the\
  \ super dark purple tulips I have since learned are called \u201CQueen of the Night.\u201D\
  \n\nAfter the cooking class and meet-up, I now had friends to meet with in the city.\
  \ So all of a sudden I had a small social life in Paris and I had a bit of a routine.\
  \ I lived in a lovely part of Paris that wasn\u2019t even on the tourist maps. (In\
  \ fact, I was told recently by friends from Paris that Parisians have re-discovered\
  \ this neighborhood, too and it had become quite trendy.)\n\nThis trip went from\
  \ being a possible big mistake to one of the best trips I have ever taken. It made\
  \ me change the way I travel from then on and I still feel nostalgia for my temporary\
  \ home in Paris."
