Text: "Contradictory Naples, in the shadows of Vesuvius, swelters and teems with loud\
  \ motorcycles and loud people. Its people are a special breed. But one forgets the\
  \ young refugees making their lives in camps across the city. World Refugee Day\
  \ in 2018 renewed my faith in humanity as I worked at the heart of the festivities.\n\
  \nOn that day, and the days after, I heard the proud stories told in their voices\
  \ at last. Tales that they were keen to tell, that no one else was listening to.\
  \ The media made them what they wanted, unskilled scroungers off the state. Italy,\
  \ Salvini, had not been kind to them. We have all been on journeys, but for the\
  \ refugees I met, their dislocation, trauma and longings were real and present.\
  \ Their travel stories are not frivolous. Refugee. Immigrant. Asylum seeker. Loaded\
  \ and unforgiving. \n\nWe headed slowly through the heat through three camps. Surrounding\
  \ the courtyard in the first were the square of buildings where they lived, clothes\
  \ dangling out of the windows in the sunlight. They updated us on their siblings\
  \ in their home countries, bandying about pictures on their cheaply purchased phones.\
  \ We showed visitors the storerooms, musty, dank and brimming with heaving piles\
  \ of old donated clothing to be sorted into men\u2019s, women\u2019s and children\u2019\
  s. This dark cool room the emblem of the charity tossed at these boys, a necessary\
  \ but empty gesture. You can have my old things. That doesn\u2019t equal acceptance\
  \ into my society. \n\nWe sat with the bright multilingual boys in each and they\
  \ wanted to practice their English, egging each other on and laughing at their attempts.\
  \ There they sat, in Europe, their bodies and minds the evidence of a long history\
  \ of empire, war and suffering, but triumphant and persisting cultures. They were\
  \ used to a long slew of Western volunteers who would come and go, but this didn\u2019\
  t deter them from probing deep into our lives and theirs. They spoke of their aspirations.\
  \ Germany, America, Canada, England. They could see the divide; we were privileged,\
  \ they were not. They hadn\u2019t asked for their formative experiences. Ours would\
  \ come from those we sought out. \u201CTravel\u201D, one boy told us. \u201CKeep\
  \ travelling and you will become wise. You will learn about people and we will become\
  \ one\u201D. \n\nAn Ethiopian man, older than the rest, sparked up a conversation\
  \ with me. He had not seen his children in three years. \u201CYou are Indian? You\
  \ know Shah Rukh Khan?\u201D, he proceeded to hum the tune of a song whose notes\
  \ have been ingrained in me all my life. We reminisced over our favourite films;\
  \ a Brit and an Ethiopian in Italy, laughing over the joys of Hindi cinema. Transnationals,\
  \ whose stories came together, giving him space to speak in a country that called\
  \ him alien.  \n\nAn oasis of learning and sharing, removed from those heady Napoli\
  \ streets, where the vegetable vendors and men on the street coercing tourists into\
  \ entering the \u2018oldest pizza restaurant in the world\u2019 did not know the\
  \ hidden stories of their fellow Neopolitans. A class of spunky long-legged school\
  \ children were the warmest in attendance. They drew us an image. Naples as a pizza\
  \ with a slice missing. The circle completed by a refugee boat sailing towards the\
  \ centre. \n\nTwo days later, we learned that one of the boys we knew well had been\
  \ shot on World Refugee Day. Not fatally, but out of malice, cackling hatred. That\
  \ afternoon as we gathered on the grand but crumbling Piazza Plebiscito, hurt amalgamated\
  \ with anger, consternation, hope. Refugees from every camp across the city marched,\
  \ singing and smiling but steely, to the piazza by the sea. All of us in a place\
  \ that wasn\u2019t our home. It was a place we embodied and took hold of. In the\
  \ crowded mel\xE9e, the thick Naples air and cigarette smoke enveloped me. I felt\
  \ physically sick but unable to wrest myself away from standing fast with the boys.\
  \ Finally, some Westerners wanted to hear. The Neapolitans having their Thursday\
  \ afternoon dip in the grimy gulf metres away, heard our chants."
