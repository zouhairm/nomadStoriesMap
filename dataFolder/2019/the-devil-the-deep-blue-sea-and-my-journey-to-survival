Text: "It was a rather sunny Sunday morning at Jabi Motor Park as I made my way to\
  \ a dark blue 7-seater Volkswagen Sharan car in the section of the park labelled\
  \ \u201CAbuja-to-Bauchi\u201D.\nI was the first passenger and quickly secured my\
  \ favorite sitting position in front, next to the driver\u2019s seat. Over time,\
  \ I was joined by five other travelers \u2013 a woman who looked like she was in\
  \ her early sixties, a much younger lady and three middle-aged men.\nWe finally\
  \ set out on the 6-hour road trip to Bauchi at about 11:30am. The first four hours\
  \ were as seamless as it could get as we breezed through the potholes of Nasarawa\
  \ state and the forests of Kaduna State. We finally made it to Jos city in the rocky\
  \ Plateau state (the last state before Bauchi, my destination).\nAll of a sudden,\
  \ we were accosted by a police officer on the roundabout at the entrance to the\
  \ city. He stopped us and sternly warned that if we proceeded any further, we would\
  \ be doing so at the expense of our lives.\n\u201CThey are killing people on this\
  \ road especially travelers. I will advise you not to continue this journey and\
  \ if you waste too much time here, the riots will catch up with you,\u201D he cautioned.\n\
  At this point, my heart was in my mouth as I quickly recited Psalm 23. The reason\
  \ for my apprehension was not far-fetched. Jos in Plateau state is known for violence\
  \ especially against travelers, with many high profile victims in the past including\
  \ a retired Army General.\nThe warning issued by the police officer seemed to perplex\
  \ our driver who immediately parked by the roadside. Visibly scared, he made a frantic\
  \ call to someone familiar with the terrain to ascertain if the road was clear for\
  \ us to return back to Abuja. \nHowever, the report he got was gloomy. The driver\
  \ was informed that we were even lucky to have passed safely to that point as there\
  \ were killings going on in some of the villages behind us.\nAlas, we were stuck\
  \ between the proverbial devil and the deep blue see; unable to proceed to our destination\
  \ and also incapable of returning to our point of departure. Not able to go forward\
  \ or backwards, we decided to proceed sideways and detoured to a nearby community\
  \ on the advice of a local who met us in our confused, stranded, and static state.\
  \ He assured us it was safe there.\nDespite the hesitation expressed by the eldest\
  \ woman in our midst, the driver started the car in a jiffy and headed for the community;\
  \ that was how my journey to survival started!\nWithin 15 minutes we arrived at\
  \ this community where the people wore a tensed look haven learnt of the carnage\
  \ going on close-by. At this point, I was also hesitant to enter a place where I\
  \ had never visited and knew no one. \n\u201CI could be killed in this community\
  \ and no one would know I ever stepped a foot here,\u201D I said to myself as I\
  \ stood at the entrance of the community alongside the other passengers for another\
  \ two hours. We finally made the collective and brave decision to seek refuge in\
  \ this unknown community and pass the night with total strangers!\nIt was 6:30pm\
  \ and getting dark when we entered the community. The people were very pleasant\
  \ as a woman offered to accommodate me and my co-travelers in her small house. It\
  \ was a very long night! My sleep was murdered at around 1am when I heard a loud\
  \ gunshot that froze me to the small cushion chair that had become my bed for the\
  \ night. \nI kept vigil till morning when the community made contacts and arranged\
  \ for two trucks of armed soldiers to escort us out of Plateau state. As we drove,\
  \ I saw many burnt cars belonging to travelers who were not lucky enough to be forewarned\
  \ of the danger ahead.\nFinally, I got to my family house in Bauchi at about 10.30am\
  \ on Monday, some 23 hours after I set out on a 6-hour road trip but I was just\
  \ happy to be alive!"
