  \ weather, it was the first place i\xB4ve traveld and i got wonderfall expierence.\
  \ I traveled with may grandmother when i was 12, we stayed in hotel frinde\xB4s\
  \ of her, a great hotel open to the nature and with great foods, when we got out\
  \ to know a part of the city i realized how hot was the city, North Juazeiro it\xB4\
  s localized in the Brazilian Northeast so it\xB4s one of the most hot place in brazil\
  \ with a tropical weather, we were to know the Statue of Padre Cicero on the hill\
  \ of Horto, and it\xB4 was so big to me and at this age i was tinny but up there\
  \ a could see another city, a tinny city, that, i don\xB4t remenber the exactly\
  \ name, next the statue there was a musem showwing the pertences of the padre CIcero,\
  \ the clothes, his room and many others things and to i know  at least a part history\
  \ of a person and the place beacause the person made part of th place was very gratifying\
  \ and to know that it is not just the weather of the place that it is hot but dicovery\
