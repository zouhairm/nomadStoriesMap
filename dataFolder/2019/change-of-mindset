Text: "There was a girl once who went to Mexico with her mom. She knew she was going\
  \ to stay mainly in Tijuana and travel from there to the US, that was what she was\
  \ more excited about. \nWhen they arrived, some family friends picked them at the\
  \ airport and on the drive home she did not understand why there was a huge fence\
  \ next to the highway. Driven by her curious nature, she asked. They told her that\
  \ was 'the border' to the US and that the little crosses represented each one of\
  \ the people that tried to cross it and did not make it. \nThat was the first shock\
  \ of reality.\nShe spent the first few days getting to know Mexico and the country\
  \ exceeded her expectations. The landscapes, the museums, the food, the bright colors\
  \ and the smile that she could see in most people faces. Locals were friendly, always\
  \ open to talk, tell their stories and willing to help them enjoy their 'home'.\
  \ \nWhile waiting in line to cross the border for the first time, there where a\
  \ lot of people selling popsicles, their home made food and other goodies that could\
  \ make the wait more enjoyable and give them some profit.\nAfter waiting for a long\
  \ time and answering a lot of questions to the border police, they made it to the\
  \ states. It felt like she had teleported to another world. Everything was tidy\
  \ and the roads where the ones she had seen in movies, wide and without and end.\n\
  San Diego, San Francisco and the other cities she discovered during the trip stole\
  \ her heart but they also made her start to wonder about deeper things. About how\
  \ unfair and how many less opportunities a kid has by just being born in one side\
  \ or the other, about those families that spend years and years without seing their\
  \ loved ones because of a document. \nThat kid opened her eyes, she researched,\
  \ she read. She was able to have a strong funded opinion and to stand for her principles\
  \ at a young age.\nI can say for a fact that that trip was a lifetime lesson and\
  \ I know it because that girl was once me."
