Text: "The landscape looked the same as we watched the sun set over North Korea. All\
  \ the distinctive mountains, pine trees, even streams, reminding us these countries\
  \ used to be no different.\n\nIt had been a long hike. The trails of Bukhansan had\
  \ been filled with packs of Korean hikers on their way down. To my surprise, I remained\
  \ one of the few ascending late into the afternoon.\n\n\u201CDo you have a torch,\u201D\
  \ a fellow hiker had asked. \u201CBe careful,\u201D another had warned, the concern\
  \ genuine.\n\nAs I approached the lower of two peaks, the drum of the megacity seemed\
  \ lost, despite the continued presence of the all-consuming infrastructure. Extending\
  \ far beyond the constraints of the Han, Seoul\u2019s skyline, encroached on the\
  \ city\u2019s various mountains, offered no sign of slowing down anytime soon.\n\
  \nEmbracing the rare silence, I set out to explore the small landing. Apart from\
  \ a life size 'H,' presumably for helicopters, and an older Korean in his late 40s,\
  \ the peak remained bare. \n\nAcknowledging my presence through simple English,\
  \ the man points to what appears to be a nearby power station.\n\n\u201CNorth Korea,\u201D\
  \ he says, \u201Cjust beyond that river,\u201D his other hand wrapped around a beer\
  \ can.\n\nOf course I knew the border was close to Seoul. Yet up here, with a view\
  \ of the progressing mountains, it seems more or less the same, despite the lack\
  \ of skyscrapers.\n\n\u201CWhere are you from,\u201D he asks, eyes locked on the\
  \ power station.\n\n\u201CHoju (Australia),\u201D I say, joining him at the bottom\
  \ of the rock, both our backs turned against the south.\n\nSomething so distant\
  \ and different in every way possible finally sits before us. The thought of human\
  \ life obsolete, but clearly hiding there further north.\n\n\u201CReunification,\u201D\
  \ I broach, not knowing whether it is appropriate or not.\n\nInstinct shows he\u2019\
  s annoyed at the question, but he maintains an expressionless face.\n\n\u201CIt\u2018\
  s complicated,\u201D his voice trails off, \u201Cwe\u2019re different now.\u201D\
  \  \n\nHe continues to list the differences in cuisine, language, attitudes and\
  \ so on. Despite the support for reunification in the near future, his scepticism\
  \ suggests otherwise.\n\nAs the lights begin to consume the metropolitan area behind\
  \ us, the northern counterpart darkens immensely. With any continuation of the peninsula\
  \ lost, the man draws a last sip of his beer.\n\n\u201CYou should go soon before\
  \ it is too dark,\u201D he offers with a slight head nod.\n\nWe acknowledge each\
  \ other one last time not knowing entirely what the other is thinking. \n\nThe international\
  \ media tends to be fixated on reunification. By day, it\u2019s reports on Donald\
  \ Trump and Kim Jong-un\u2019s meetings. By evening, it\u2019s turning a blind eye\
  \ to what is really happening in the darkness before us. But one thing we continue\
  \ to overlook, are the voices that matter most."
