Text: "The cool breeze softened the muscles on my face. My eyes were closed and the\
  \ sun beamed down greeting my skin with an abundance of Vitamin D. I was floating\
  \ in dazzling emerald green waters, my feet dangling along in the fresh, warm Sicilian\
  \ sea. As a child I always felt safer in a swimming pool, but I\u2019m older now\
  \ and less dramatic. Plus I had a trustworthy rubber ring float, that\u2019s definitely\
  \ not made for five year olds. The Mediterranean Sea was clear as day, overlooking\
  \ stunning rocky cliffs. I felt calm, relaxed, at absolute ease. That was until\
  \ my friend toppled my ring float over and I fell down, down, into the petrifying\
  \ abyss. Although gravity meant that I floated back up as quick as I fell down.\
  \ The sea salt stung my eyes and I spat the remaining water out like a fountain\
  \ with a broken nozzle. I splashed my friends in a spur of revenge and waddled my\
  \ way through the heavy sea back to the shore.\n\nSyracuse, a remote and unusual\
  \ part of Sicily is where we escaped to. Home to the mafia, sunshine and cheap booze.\
  \ Seventeen years old and our first group holiday abroad without adults. My parents\
  \ were quite trusting. The sense of freedom was liberating. I clasped my toes beneath\
  \ the sparkling, crystalized looking sand and took a deep breath in of fresh, unpolluted\
  \ air. I stretched my neck to the furthest point It could look and viewed the perimeter\
  \ of the beach. A breath-taking stretch of golden sand, not a dead crab to be seen\
  \ anywhere like in Dublin beaches. This, this is my happy place I thought. \n\n\
  We were greeted in the airport by a middle aged man with a wrinkled forehead who\
  \ had virtually no English, holding a limp sign with my name on it. Our trusting\
  \ friend booked the large taxi van from a questionable website. We were driving\
  \ on an unlit, remote stretch of road in the middle of nowhere. The driver was silent,\
  \ giving just an occasional glance over his shoulder every so often, with a blank\
  \ expression on his face. We turned and went in the opposite direction to the Syracuse\
  \ sign, the other two girls were riddled with fear in the leather back seat assuming\
  \ we were about to be human trafficked. Whilst the lads were hysterical, cracking\
  \ jokes of all the brutal ways we could possibly die. I myself was trying to remain\
  \ calm and not let the paranoia creep its way in. \n\nAfter almost two hours we\
  \ arrived to our destination. We were situated in an ancient, run down area. On\
  \ the corner of the building just before our hostel, we viewed ladies of the night\
  \ in revealing, laced clothing preparing for business. The old historic building\
  \ had steep, dark staircases, difficult to climb up after having a few too many\
  \ Jack and Cokes, while hoping not to perish to an untimely death. \n\nSyracuse\
  \ was like a ghost town during the day. Yet at night families and friends would\
  \ gather and celebrate until all hours, infants up and full of life at 2am. In this\
  \ strange place there were no bars or wild night clubs as promised, yet ice cream\
  \ shops, selling the best gelato and liquor that Sicily had to offer. Pints of straight\
  \ Jaeger burnt the back of my throat as it went down, but there was cool ice cream\
  \ to balance it out. \n\nOn our last night we were informed by locals of a restaurant\
  \ that was turned into a lavish nightclub on a Saturday night. We danced on wobbly\
  \ table tops, bought expensive alcohol and puked our hearts out. We were a big hit\
  \ with the Sicilian people, singing \u2018Irelande drinke grande\u2019 all night\
  \ long.\n\nSyracuse was a one and done kind of place. We experienced what they had\
  \ to offer and created some hilarious memories that left a permanent imprint on\
  \ our hearts.\nWe could have gone to Ibiza or Magaluf like any other group of young\
  \ people, but for some perverse reason Syracuse was calling out to us and we answered\
  \ that calling with open arms."
