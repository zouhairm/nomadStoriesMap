Text: "\u201CMagically\u201D, or better to say after five hard travelling days with\
  \ every kind of transportation I arrived in Mala, 10 Km away from Cobu\xE9.  A spectacular\
  \ and remote place at the Shore of Malawi Lake, or better known in Mozambique as\
  \ the Niassa Lake, or the Lake of the Stars. \n\nIf you have a look on an atlas,\
  \ the spot is so insignificant. The first genuine question is, \u201Chow did you\
  \ know about this spot?\u201D and \u201Cwho showed you such a well-kept secret?\u201D\
  \ There are different r answers, \u201Cit came out from one of my dreams\u201D and\
  \ then by chance I could follow my instinct and find it, \u201Cout pure great luck\u201D\
  . Probably in the end it happened to be a mixture of both these factors. The difficulty\
  \ of reaching such a destination made me feel so close to the legendary time of\
  \ the Portuguese discoverers of Bartolomeo Dias  or the mythical research of the\
  \ Nile sources, held by Doctor Livingstone and Henry Morton Stanley.\n\nMy astonishment\
  \ was great when I started appreciating a white sandy beach, blue water looking\
  \ more like the Caribbean Sea encompassed by mountains, which offered a nice protection\
  \ from every kind of intrusive presence. \n\nThe kindness of the locals was touching,\
  \ especially because I was unexpected and unannounced. I showed up one morning on\
  \ a motorbike, with a local driver and a backpack fixed in a strange way. Francis,\
  \ an elegant tall man, the owner of the Lodge, asked me if I was looking for somebody\
  \ or if he missed one of his emails. I surprised him by telling him I was just looking\
  \ for a quiet and nice spot where to recharge my batteries. It looked like the perfect\
  \ location to swim in the lake with the kids\u2019 supervision, as there are still\
  \ crocodiles in the lake and enjoying the peace, created by such natural beauty\
  \ and lack of pollution. \n\nIn the evening I was enjoying time with Francis and\
  \ his family by the fire, after appreciating a red and purple sunset, taking so\
  \ many pictures and meditating about my next travelling itineraries. Everybody met\
  \ up enjoying a cold drink. We started admiring a sheltering sky, they started showing\
  \ me different stars with incredible names, \u201Cbut I looked really lost to say\
  \ the least\u201D, I could not even recognize the South Cross.\n\nWhen the Giraffe\
  \ story was told, according to an old Bushman legend. \n\u201CIn the beginning of\
  \ the time, the sun did not know really well its way around. The Creator decided\
  \ to ask the giraffe to check the sun direction to help it to follow the correct\
  \ itinerary. The giraffe took real seriously her duty that the sun never made any\
  \ mistake, the Creator decided that this animal should be rewarded and therefore\
  \ he changed some stars position, to let the stars having  a giraffe shape in the\
  \ sky. This shape helped so many African travelers to find their path in the night\
  \ by following Tutwa(Giraffe) the Southern Cross\u201D. \n\nI was amazed by this\
  \ story and I become more and more eager to hear more old African stories. Unfortunately,\
  \ bed time was announced and everybody retired to their cottage. In that moment\
  \ by walking I realized that my \u201CMal d\u2019Afrique\u201D was justified by\
  \ the beauty of such powerful nature and about the wisdom of its people and their\
  \ traditions. \n\nThe following day I did a challenging trek in the forest to get\
  \ more inspiration. I realized that the magic ancestral world brought me by the\
  \ 2000 years old baobab next to the village. \n\n\nI started reading the African\
  \ stories book Francis lent me, after confessing the source of his story teller\
  \ skills and so I checked the reason why  the Baobab received such a rare shape.\
  \ It was punished by the Creator for being so demanding and jealous of other plants,\
  \ of the palm tree for its shape and length, of the flame tree for its beautiful\
  \  red flowers, of the fig tree for its delicious fruits. God decided to punish\
  \ his arrogance by replanting him upside down and not allowing him to compare his\
  \ shape to other plants and avoiding the tree seeing his reflection in the lake."
