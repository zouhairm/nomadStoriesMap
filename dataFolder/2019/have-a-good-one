Text: "My family and I were walking through the narrow streets of London suburbs,\
  \ talking about the sunny Italian weather we had traded for a few days of drizzle\
  \ and clouds. My sister was telling us about how much she loved the unpredictability\
  \ of the climate in the United Kingdom, she said it is one of those places where\
  \ you can experience all the four seasons in one day. The period of time that elapses\
  \ between enjoying the sun in short sleeves and looking for a place where to shelter\
  \ from chill wind and rain could be surprisingly short. \u201CThis is one of the\
  \ reasons why you could never get tired of London!\u201D, she added with a smile\
  \ which showed her perfect white teeth, almost of the same colour as the sky she\
  \ was looking at. As for me, I have always preferred those places in which you could\
  \ sunbathe all the year or, at least, wear something without worrying about feeling\
  \ like someone who has been catapulted from the other hemisphere twice a day. However,\
  \ I had to admit I was enjoying London, and the lights and decorations made it even\
  \ more magical than in the pictures I had seen. Our talk was interrupted by my mother\
  \ saying she wasn\u2019t sure we were going in the right direction. The line on\
  \ her forehead became more pronounced while she looked at the street back and forth\
  \ and compared it to the road map. \u201CI still can\u2019t believe that the underground\
  \ is not working\u201D stated my father while taking his phone out of the pocket,\
  \ \u201Cbut we should have thought about it, it\u2019s the 25th of December!\u201D\
  . Luckily the city centre was at walking distance from the hotel, it would have\
  \ taken less than an hour, but it was already late for lunchtime according to the\
  \ English standards and we didn\u2019t want to eat at food trucks, again. While\
  \ my mom and my sister were trying to get their bearings by looking at the map,\
  \ I was helping my father set the satnav. \u201CWhat are you looking for?\u201D\
  \ whispered a voice behind me, coming from below. I turned and saw a guy who was\
  \ just getting up from the step where he was sitting, in front of a closed shop.\
  \ His dog followed him as he came towards us, \u201Care you lost?\u201D bubbled\
  \ him in a weird way while trying to make a shield with his hands, in order to light\
  \ the cigarette he was holding between his lips. His fingers were extremely slender\
  \ and so was he, you could see he was scrawny despite the width of his worn out\
  \ clothes. \u201CUhm\u2026 Piccadilly Circus, from here?\u201D answered my dad with\
  \ a strong Italian accent, trying to fill the knowledge gaps in this strange foreign\
  \ language by gesticulating. \u201CCome with me\u201D nodded the lad after having\
  \ blankly stared into space for a while. As he was walking us to what seemed to\
  \ be a bigger street, he asked where we were from and if we were enjoying the city,\
  \ \u201CLondon can make you feel alone sometimes\u201D told us before breaking into\
  \ laughter. His teeth, the ones he still had, could as well remind the sky but,\
  \ unlike my sister\u2019s ones, they had the same colour of the clouds before the\
  \ storm. He was so consumed that, at first sight, you would say he was in his early\
  \ forties but after a careful look I could definitely conclude he wasn\u2019t more\
  \ than thirty. The wrinkles around his kind eyes were only caused by tiredness.\
  \ As my father told our improvised tour guide that he was beginning to recognize\
  \ the area, we passed in front of a small caf\xE9 we had already seen the day before.\
  \ \u201CHang on\u201D muttered the young man so quietly I wasn\u2019t even sure\
  \ he had spoken, and he got into the bar. While we were wondering if we had to wait\
  \ for him or just go by ourselves, he came out with a large cup of takeaway coffee\
  \ and offered it to us \u201CI am sorry but I just could afford one, share it on\
  \ the way to warm yourselves up. Merry Christmas, have a good one!\u201D"
