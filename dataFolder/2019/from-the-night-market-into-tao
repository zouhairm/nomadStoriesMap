Text: "I was in Europe and she was across the Ocean in Argentina, South America. We\
  \ met at this big annual world wide congress in Buenos Aires and we decided to attend\
  \ the next meeting in Taiwan. Ana flew from Buenos Aires to Amsterdam, I flew via\
  \ Dubai to Taiwan. The arrival : Taipei. Two different airplain companies, both\
  \ of us planned to arrive in aproximatley the same time in Taipei. 6 hours of driving,\
  \ I get in my plain to Dubai, and I find out they have this \"wifi in the sky\"\
  \ possibility for connection. First time thing. Once I acces it, I read millions\
  \ of messages how all flights might be cancelled due to a thaiphoon in Taiwan. I'm\
  \ finally in Dubai. June. 47 C. My flight cancelled. Ana arrives to Taipei. I have\
  \ acces only to my handbag, which this tike was emptier than usual. What a luck.\
  \ 2 days after, I arrive to Taipei. \n\n\nI love this weather. Warmth. Some people\
  \ would hate this, but for me...it was like a hug. Every morning I woke up and I\
  \ left the cold airconditioned buildings feeling like somebody is hugging me. That\
  \ constant heat, that amazing warm weather which made me smile every morning, felt\
  \ like being able to wash away any problem. I'm still jetlegged, tired and I'm having\
  \ sleeping issues. I can't sleep...it's 5 in the morning. I stay in this building\
  \ which looks up intro the wild, perfect view, a big garden, birds singing, a lake\
  \ and a huge temple above. Every day the same view. Red, yellow, green and blue.\
  \ Warmth and silence. Exotic. 6 in the morning. I'm heading the mountain in the\
  \ early morning and I step on 300 stairs. In the early morning, this view of the\
  \ wildness down intro the valley towards the city, reminded me how small we are\
  \ and how high we can get. I see this temple, and smoke, and people praying in this\
  \ perfectly balanced environment of warmth and green, hidden and exotic place. The\
  \ heaviness to walk up there gives to everything a stronger reason of existance.\
  \ I suddenly wanted to know more. \n\nAs the night came, I wanted to see what means\
  \ this street market means for the asians. They have something for cooking on the\
  \ streets. I am right there at the beginning of the market and I feel this smells\
  \ as a new born child who feels for the first time the smell of a food. Everything\
  \ was new. The air was a mix of ingredients, spicy and fried...I could say sometimes\
  \ too different for my limited but very sensitive olfactive sense. I see all this\
  \ people's faces, they are used with this. It seems so natural for them. They smile.\
  \ I smile. Like this maybe, we can feel more familiar to each other. Still...I would\
  \ rather run from here. In the end we are so different. I barely support these new\
  \ smells at the moment. I maybe...need to get used. We are different. \n\nAt the\
  \ end of the market I see this temple. Tao. Cupidon. People burning this scented\
  \ bars and having high connections with their Gods. I feel...I arrived at the right\
  \ place. I try to follow them, follow their habits, do the same. Non sense. I need\
  \ to ask what all these means. Smoke, connections to the Gods, questions and answers\
  \ in wooden pieces, the God of love. I found out. Spirituality. Faith. Unity. Now\
  \ I know...I came here to find out, we was never different. We are one. We believe\
  \ in nothing, in everything or in one, in science or technology, in humanity or\
  \ in nature, in doesn't matter what, but when we search strenght, when we need help\
  \ to clear our thoughts, we are not the tourist from the Night Market and the locals,\
  \ we are not the differences between me and them, we are all the same, we are humans,\
  \ we are one. We are searching for the same things, for the same wellbeing, for\
  \ the same smile on our faces, for peace and love. From the Night Market...to the\
  \ Tao Temple."
