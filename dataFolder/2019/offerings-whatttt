Text: "Visiting a new place always gives a new experience. At that place, you face\
  \ many new and different things or incidents. But some are so weird that you can't\
  \ hope or imagine. That gives an everlasting impression on your mind.\n        \
  \       Something similar happened to me, when I got a chance to visit a monastery,\
  \ located in the heart of Dehradun city, on my trip to Uttarakhand in August 2015.\n\
  \               The place is heaven for the folks seeking peace. The 170 feet tall\
  \ golden standing statue of Buddha, which can be seen from far away, spreads peace\
  \ around and provide calmness to observer. The fully green campus has its own aura.\
  \ \n               The monastery is a fine example of Tibetan architecture. It has\
  \ 220 feet high central stupa and other small stupas. I got lost myself in that\
  \ peace.\n               Well, when I reached there, firstly I walked throughout\
  \ the campus capturing light of beauty of the campus and lastly I reached the main\
  \ temple at the time of prayer.\n          In the main temple which have scintillating\
  \ carvings on it's walls, there was a golden statue of Buddha and beside him there\
  \ was a sitting statue of the golden man worshipped by Han monks.  \n         Prayer\
  \ started. I sat there. All monks were praying in unison. They were singing in Tibetan\
  \ language. At a particular interval, they rang bells together. Spirituality was\
  \ flowing there. I had lost myself in that spiritual flow.\n          At the end\
  \ of prayer I came outside. Then a young monk came to me and say to me,\"Please,\
  \ take this Prasad( offerings to god during worship).\" When I saw at his hand,\
  \ I was amazed. He had a packet of chips, a packet of biscuits and a bottle of coke\
  \ in hand. I looked at him surprisingly. He gave those offerings to me with a smile\
  \ mixed of hesitation. I accepted those things and walked away smiling.\n      \
  \       No one can normally thinks about such things as offerings to God. When we\
  \ say about offerings or prasad, usually we have images of various fruits and traditional\
  \ things in our mind. But that day! Oh! That was completely unexpected to me. At\
  \ a moment, I didn't believe on my eyes.\n               Now, whenever those memories\
  \ knocks, I have a smile on my face. For me that was also a new discovery that how\
  \ the faith is also changing in this new and changing world."
