Text: "Amritsar! Euphoric thoughts race through my head... As I mulled over the city,\
  \ which takes its name from Amrit Sarovar, a rush of adrenalin passed through my\
  \ body. An easy smile played on my lips, on recollecting those beautiful moments\
  \ of absolute belonging and bliss. \nLanding is the least favorite moment of my\
  \ journey; it makes me feel terribly dizzy and not right in my stomach. I looked\
  \ at the comparatively small airport filled with turbaned men, and women, some sober,\
  \ some loud. Tugging at my turquoise trolley, I went ahead looking for a cab to\
  \ reach my destination. In a good forty minutes, I reached Shivaay Grand, the hotel,\
  \ which was located in the heart of the old market area.\nAmritsar in the early\
  \ hours, with all its shutters down, appeared to be an extremely quiet place. For\
  \ the early morning ceremony of the Palki Sahib, the owner of the hotel directed\
  \ me to the Golden Temple complex.  Harmandir Sahib was a long walk from the hotel.\
  \ The labyrinth of streets posed a challenge. Heads either covered in chadars, big\
  \ white handkerchiefs or turbans rushed towards the sanctum. I left my slippers\
  \ out as most do and cleansed my feet in a small pool of cool water. Engulfed in\
  \ a sense of otherworldliness, I shuffled through the crowd. There lay in front\
  \ of me a serene Sarovar (a bathing pool believed to have healing powers) that reflected\
  \ the purplish sky and the surrealistically lit Golden Temple. It seemed like the\
  \ Golden Temple was afloat. \nI rushed straight to join the queue, women and men\
  \ alike were chanting prayers, waiting their turn patiently. There were thousands\
  \ of people and surprisingly decorum was maintained throughout, while the Kirtan\
  \ \u2013 the Shabad Kirtan (holy songs accompanied by a tabla and harmonium) played\
  \ on in the background. Finally, my long wait had ended, content with my prayers,\
  \ I found myself straying away from the queue, heading towards the Sarovar, if not\
  \ for the tap on my shoulder. I turned around and came face to face with an old\
  \ Sardarji holding onto a big utensil ready to serve me the Karah Prasad, halva\
  \ made of whole-wheat flour. I accepted the Prasad with cupped hands and thanked\
  \ him. \nWrapping my chadar properly around my head, I leisurely walked towards\
  \ the Sarovar. I sat on the marble parapet, dipping my fingers into the cool water\
  \ of the Sarovar. My thoughts led me to a land incorporeal and tranquil. I closed\
  \ my eyes and relaxed my body, breathing in the spiritual energy. I was pulled out\
  \ of my reverie soon, somebody had been calling me, \u201CBhenji, bhenji, uth jaiye\u201D\
  \ (Sister, sister, get up). I sprang up almost instantly, uttering several apologies.\
  \  Sri Guru Granth Sahib was being escorted in the Palki or the palanquin, laden\
  \ with flowers and all the devotees were singing the Gurbani kirtan (hymns). Within\
  \ a stretch of an hour, everything was calm again and people started to sit. Some\
  \ absorbed in seva (cleaning the Golden Temple); some busy capturing the picturesque\
  \ scene and other early risers taking a dip in the inky lake. \nThe orangish-golden\
  \ medallion like sun transfixed me. The quietude of the moment left me intoxicated\
  \ and filled me with a Zen-like peace. To a person looking at the view from above,\
  \ it would appear to be a site of pure beauty merged with devotional hymns proclaiming\
  \ Ishq (highest form of love) for the divine. \nSoon it was time for the langar\
  \ (a communal free kitchen). After grabbing my steel plate and cup, I sat cross-legged\
  \ on a chatai (a mat), humbled, awaiting my share of the langar. A man in a yellow\
  \ turban served steaming chai (tea). The muddy brown chai was sickeningly sweet.\
  \ A boy, of about 10 years, shyly held out a steel plate of elaichi toast from which\
  \ I took two. Sated at having had my fill, I slipped out of the hall, still in the\
  \ daze of an exhilarating experience, muttering to myself, \u2018Subah ho gayi\u2019\
  \ (It is morning)."
