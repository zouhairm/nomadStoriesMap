Text: "From Morocco to Iran the area known as the Middle East or the Middle East North\
  \ Africa region (MENA) is now more than ever subject to curiosity from the outside.\
  \ The region invokes intrigue for the vast amount of history that has taken place\
  \ in it; the cradle of civilization the birthplace of the three Abrahamic religions\
  \ and vast swimming pools of oil. Turkey is one of the countries that socially and\
  \ culturally tied to the MENA region but is situated in both Europe and Asia making\
  \ it too Western for some and too Eastern for others. Where does Turkey fit in this\
  \ not so \u2018new\u2019 but remixed global paradigm of East meets West? This is\
  \ not a new question and there still don't seem to be clear answers. \n\nThis dichotomy\
  \ is what makes Turkey unique and gives it the je ne sais quoi that has attracted\
  \ millions of tourist a year. Stepping off the plane in Istanbul there is a sense\
  \ that modernization has met antiquity in the perfect binary that so defines the\
  \ capital city. From shisha cafes on the street corner where old men are spotted\
  \ meeting up with tea in their hands and smoke in their lungs to large shiny shopping\
  \ malls where the newest designer labels are plucked off the shelves with as much\
  \ speed as Rodeo Drive. \n\nWhile there are many tangible examples of this East\
  \ meets West phenomenon in Istanbul the hammam is one that stands out the most.\
  \ The hammam is one of the oldest traditions that has withstood the test of time\
  \ and continues to be a beacon of old in a city that is starting to look newer and\
  \ newer. As time passed the role of the hammam in  Turkish social life changed and\
  \ adapted and more and more hammams opened on the streets of Istanbul welcoming\
  \ men, women, and children. One of the most breathtaking is the K\u0131l\u0131\xE7\
  \ Ali Pa\u015Fa Hamam created by the architect Sinan between 1578-1583 as part of\
  \ the mosque and school complex that flank it today. The hammam is a symbolic building\
  \ famous for its architectural ingenuity, majestic dome, and rich history providing\
  \ those on the inside and outside a reminder of all that has been and all that is\
  \ to come. \n\nK\u0131l\u0131\xE7 Ali Pa\u015Fa Hamam was renovated for seven years\
  \ to restore, refresh, and rebirth the public space that had been a pillar of the\
  \ Ottoman Empire. The renovations represent seven years of hard work and passion\
  \ and as the silence of the hammam engulfs visitors they are swallowed whole into\
  \ the architectural masterpiece with its high white walls, marble floors, domed\
  \ roof and the whole time there is a strong sense that this is more than a luxurious\
  \ bath. The hammam has always been more than a bathhouse but now more than ever\
  \ it feels like a small act of defiance towards those that hold negative sentiment\
  \ towards the region. Disrobing, lying naked and vulnerable on a heated slab of\
  \ marble, then having a stranger wash and scrub as if you were a child brings to\
  \ mind just how important these small acts of resistance are. The ritual itself\
  \ has changed little over the years and today there are many hammams in Istanbul\
  \ that welcome visitors with open arms. Smoking a shisha pipe, adorning oneself\
  \ with oud, and stripping down to be cleansed in a hammam are all ways that Turks\
  \ are saying that they are going to continue being themselves whether outsiders\
  \ in the region and abroad understand or not. \n\nModern doesn\u2019t have to be\
  \ synonymous with Western and having to conform to Western standards is no longer\
  \ the case in many MENA countries as a new generation of architects, artists, and\
  \ innovators are taking back their culture and the history embedded into it. Turks\
  \ are proud of their home and willing to share its hidden and not so hidden gems\
  \ with those who are willing. Entering a hammam is an act of resistance, an act\
  \ of preserving history, and an act of solidarity."
