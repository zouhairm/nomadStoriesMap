Text: "It all started in Punta Cana when i was younger. The restaurant that had windows\
  \ in the floor so i could see the splendid marine creatures made me want to go back.\
  \ Then, the road trips with my father throughout Colombia taught me to love my country.\
  \ We used to jump from the vibrant capital, Bogot\xE1, to Cartagena, an ancient,\
  \ colonial and warm coast city, with loving people and great music. Many years later\
  \ i returned to the coast, and i ended up in Taganga, fifteen minutes aways from\
  \ Santa Marta. This magical beach has the most crystalline water I have ever seen\
  \ in my life. And i have to admit, after touring the great state of Florida a few\
  \ years later after Santa Marta, and then moving there for a long time, i thought\
  \ i had life figured all out. Since my first trip to the United States with my father,\
  \ i fell in love with the different colors of the great ocean, the smell of oranges\
  \ every time we drove by the entrance of a new town, the beautiful sunsets that\
  \ had different colors every season:  intense red in the summer, a mix of grey,\
  \ light blue and orange in the fall, yellow and dark blue at winter, and clouds\
  \ with light purple, soft pink and a turquoise green in breezy spring. These colors\
  \ got more intense when i lived there, and when it rained, the strong sound and\
  \ the smell of the ground, somehow always reminded me of home. At the moment i knew\
  \ i had to come back, the strange feeling of abandoning my future and leave behind\
  \ the greatest moments of the sand in my foot, the way the guy i loved looked at\
  \ me in the eyes, a great part of my family and my school, made me want to give\
  \ up, but suddenly it all came to me: sometimes the best choice is to go back out\
  \ again to the place that saw you become the person you are now, so you can remind\
  \ yourself why is necessary to travel and jump from a place to another and to never\
  \ stop. People talk about how easy is to leave to a foreign country, whether you\u2019\
  re traveling or moving away, but no one says that is hard when it\u2019s time to\
  \ return. The beautiful country of Colombia is prodigious, filled with art and culture,\
  \ small and big places with amazing worldwide cuisine distributed inside Bogot\xE1\
  , it\u2019s full of surprises. Cold nights and warm days with the aroma of the best\
  \ coffee in the world, including a unique charm with great vitality and a pleasant\
  \ place to be happy whether you\u2019re living or visiting.  I was about to quit\
  \ but later on i remembered why i started, because i have always been two thousand\
  \ six hundred metres closer to the stars and to my wishes to fly. The only obstacle\
  \ of my beloved Colombia is that the huge risk of traveling to this magical place\
  \ is wanting to stay. Home is always a great idea, but traveling is getting out\
  \ of your comfort zone because is experimenting different changes in yourself, in\
  \ the way you think about every moment you\u2019ll have for the rest of your life.\
  \ It is also going out to the world, or just a little but significant piece of it,\
  \ and the best part but the hardest one, is always coming back, and that is why\
  \ i love to travel, and that is the main reason why i do it all over and all over\
  \ again. I didn\u2019t expect to feel an intense wish to keep moving, a strange\
  \ but meaningful motivation to have the connections i had with people from another\
  \ culture, the places that watched me be extraordinary with my self, with no attachments\
  \ to objects or some (toxic) people in my old life. If someday somebody decides\
  \ to make you feel worthless or not powerful enough to travel to the places you\
  \ love the most, you have to remind yourself that no one has truly lived like you,\
  \ your heart is always making you feel and you mind makes you realize the things\
  \ that are coming for you."
