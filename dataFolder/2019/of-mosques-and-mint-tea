Text: "\u201CNo come in, only Muslims. Please go.\u201D\n\nA local fiercely stopped\
  \ me from entering the premises of the mosque. It immediately became apparent that\
  \ the inside of mosques in Marrakech were strictly off limits to visitors, non-Muslim\
  \ ones at least. I tried explaining that I too am a Muslim and my intention was\
  \ simply to carry out prayers. He eyed me from head to toe, heavy with suspicion.\
  \ Pretty sure the manbun I was spotting, and my dressing did not help my case. His\
  \ stare reminded me of my presence as a tourist in a foreign land. I was not one\
  \ of them.\n\nWe had arrived a couple of hours ago, armed with backpacks and a sense\
  \ of jubilation. This rose-tinted city visually greeted us just like how we imagined\
  \ it to be \u2013 buildings in the most beautiful shades of pink, intricate architecture\
  \ that arrests your attention and souks just beaming with colours and vibrancy.\
  \ \n\nThe excitement was short-lived as we soon became overwhelmed with our surroundings\
  \ and our obvious identities as tourists. Every few steps, local young guys would\
  \ walk alongside us and offer directions, in hopes for exchange of money. Food vendors\
  \ physically pulled us into their restaurants whilst shopkeepers enthusiastically\
  \ called upon our attention. Though none of the acts were ill-intentioned, our senses\
  \ were quickly heightened. We slowly became drained and our enthusiasm no longer\
  \ matched the city\u2019s vibrancy. We headed to a local caf\xE9 to seek refuge,\
  \ both from the summer heat and the bustle. We sat in silence, weighted by this\
  \ sense of uncertainty. \n\n\u201CYou, Muslim?\u201D\n\nI nodded. Full of reservation,\
  \ the elder gestured me to enter with him, his steps soon punctuated with doubtful\
  \ side glances. He brought over a pail of water and watched closely as I carried\
  \ out my ablution. I had done this a thousand time but never once under such pressure,\
  \ each movement now calculated. He nodded after I finished - a strange sign of validation\
  \ - and I shadowed him into the main prayer hall. He went one way and I, the other.\
  \ \n\nAfter performing my prayers, I sat and basked both in the silence and beauty\
  \ of the white marbled interior, both far cries from the bustling streets outside.\
  \ From the corner of my eye, I saw the elder walking, accompanied by a younger man,\
  \ towards me. Had I overstayed my welcome?\n\nThey sat next to me and the younger\
  \ man introduced himself. He passed on the message that the elder hope that I do\
  \ not take offence to our interactions earlier. I smiled in return. He shared that\
  \ for them, especially the older generation, the influx of tourists is still something\
  \ they are grappling with. As much as they are proud and love sharing the beauty\
  \ of Marrakech to the rest of the world, they began to see how the world\u2019s\
  \ presence brought about changes to their beloved city. It became less of Marrakech\
  \ they were once familiar with and now, more of a city catered to tourists. This\
  \ probably explained why they were protective of their mosques \u2013 it wasn\u2019\
  t the sanctity of religion per se but rather the sanctity of their identities. Undeniably,\
  \ it was a hard position for them to be thrusted into and one that they are still\
  \ learning to make sense of. \n\nThe elder placed his hand on my shoulder, the same\
  \ hand that earlier pointed me out of the mosque albeit now much more comforting.\
  \ In that moment, it established a similarity between us: we were all discovering\
  \ Marrakech. As tourists, we yearn to experience this enigmatic city for ourselves\
  \ and witness narratives it contains. As locals, they too are (re)discovering Marrakech\
  \ in a new light with their culture now in flux.\n\nI invited them to meet my friends\
  \ who had been waiting at the caf\xE9. What ensued was a conversation over mint\
  \ tea where we shared about our respective hometowns, families and the best local\
  \ places to eat tagine. The conversation was simple, but enough - enough for us\
  \ all to learn different perspectives and accompanying anxieties, enough to inculcate\
  \ a sense of empathy for the other and lastly, enough to show how mutual respect\
  \ is truly the common language between humans alike."
