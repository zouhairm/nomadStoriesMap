Text: "In January, I had the opportunity to visit India because I was chosen to be\
  \ a delegate for my country at Telangana Jagruthi International Youth Conference\
  \ 2019. I was jumping for joy at that time because India is one of my travel bucket\
  \ lists and the best things I've got is my airfare funded by my campus and all the\
  \ accommodation and transportation when I in India provided by the committee during\
  \ the conference. The conference was held in Hyderabad, one of the biggest city\
  \ in South India. I arrived at Rajiv Gandhi International Airport at midnight and\
  \ incidentally, I met another delegate for the conference from China and Cambodia\
  \ because we are on the same plane actually. After that, I realized that one of\
  \ the Cambodian delegates was sitting next to me when we're on a plane and we're\
  \ not having a conversation there at all, but now he is one of my best friends abroad.\
  \ So when the committee drove us to the hotel, me and two Cambodians (they are Tana\
  \ and Pong) sat together in a car and we had fun conversations and we decided to\
  \ sightsee together because we had one free day before the conference began. This\
  \ is how the story begins.\n\nSo when the morning came, my Indonesian friend (his\
  \ name is Meidi) belled my room to wake up me and asked me to had breakfast together.\
  \ We're very confused much when we took our meals (it's totally Indian cuisines)\
  \ because we don't know how to eat them in a proper way so we just sit in dining\
  \ table first while waiting someone took the meals, and we follow them how they\
  \ put it. The dishes were truly extraordinary, it made my first day feel very happy\
  \ and couldn't wait to sightsee. I told him that I had the plan to sightsee with\
  \ Tana and Pong and ask him to join, but he can't join us because he has to finish\
  \ his thesis, what a heck.  No longer after that, Me, Tana, and Pong shredd the\
  \ city together. \n\nThe first destination was Charminar. We use tuk-tuk (three-wheel\
  \ vehicle and it's one of public transportation in there) to get over there. It's\
  \ one of the old heritage Muslim buildings in India and it's also one of the Hyderabad's\
  \ icon. It completely makes me feel like I'm in India as well because it's crowded\
  \ enough in there and many people who sell fabric and gem in there. We also tried\
  \ local biryani in there together and it's mostly cheaper than we thought. After\
  \ we ate the biryani, we facing one serious problem enough, when we go to sim card\
  \ store we can't purchase the sim card because we have to own India Identity Card\
  \ it means we can't have internet connection while we're in India except using wifi.\
  \ So we just rely on the people at that time for the direction and information feel\
  \ like we're at the 2000s. We continued our trip to Nehru Zoological Park, it's\
  \ not really far from Charminar. The last destination on that day is Golconda Fort.\
  \ \n\nGolconda Fort actually quite far from Nehru Zoological Park. Golconda Fort\
  \ is a very broad building and old fortress in South India. We came here at the\
  \ right time, in the afternoon, where the sun was halfway down and it was very nice\
  \ to have the sunset here. Suddenly there's a miracle and touchable moment for me.\
  \ Well, I have heavy burn scars which were my body damaged. So when I paid the entry\
  \ tickets, the officers didn't accept my money and they said you \"don't have to\
  \ paid because your hand damaged\". This is certainly a moment that touched me with\
  \ India, although many people think India has a high crime rate, slum, dirty, and\
  \ other things that are not good, but behind that they actually have extraordinary\
  \ goodness they give new enthusiasm to people who are disabled and provide convenience\
  \ as a form of love and care for them. After spent around 2 hours there, ridiculous\
  \ thing happens to us. We forgot to write our hotel address while we didn't have\
  \ any internet connection, so we felt like three idiots in there."
