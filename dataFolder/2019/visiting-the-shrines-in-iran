Text: "When I had the opportunity to go to Iran for a month I was both excited and\
  \ scared of how different it would be. That journey, however, changed my choices,\
  \ my views,my life. \n\nAfter much planning, we finally took off. The long flight\
  \ made me even more excited, and also nervous because there was family waiting that\
  \ I had never met. I was afraid they wouldn't accept me, or that I wouldn't be able\
  \ to speak their language. I really didn't know what to expect. I couldn't even\
  \ imagine how my family would feel because it was first time we were traveling to\
  \ iran.\n\nWe made stop after stop until we were just an hour away. I took deep\
  \ breaths as I watched a lady wipe off all her makeup and put on her veil; it seemed\
  \ everything had changed. I didn't understand why she was doing that, but I learned\
  \ that if she had left the airplane wearing makeup, the women in Iran would have\
  \ been disgusted. I was going to a country where women must be fully covered,revealing\
  \ only their faces.\n\nFinally, we arrived in Iran and everything was different,\
  \ I felt out of place as people stared. We got through customs and I saw a young\
  \ girl scream my name. Who could that be? I wondered. It was my friend. My friend's\
  \ family grabbed us and hugged us as if this were the last time we wouldever see\
  \ each other. They were so excited to see us that standing in the middle of everything\
  \ hugging didn't matter one bit. As I gazed at my surroundings,feeling scared and\
  \ out of place, I took my uncle's hand.\n\nThe next day when I awoke, I heard a\
  \ lamb fighting for its life. As I watched two men slaughter it, my eyes shattered\
  \ into darkness. What was going on? My uncle assured me nothing was wrong; it is\
  \ the custom when a family member visits to kill a lamb. I turned away as they gutted\
  \ and skinned the lamb, my stomach turned inside out. I couldn't possibly eat what\
  \ had been killed. I was lost; there were people in and out of the house, and people\
  \ I had never seen before were kissing me. I loved being in Iran.\n\nAfter a week,\
  \ I started getting used to everyone, and the customs. I went out on the streets\
  \ for the first time with my grandmother. I was amazed at how similar it was to\
  \ home. I encouraged myself to enjoy, because this would be an experience I would\
  \ want to remember. There was so much to see, and so much to do. I went to get fresh\
  \ bread for breakfast one morning - we walked because it was so close -and it cost\
  \ as little as one cent for a whole sheet. It was amazing. \n\nI began to enjoy\
  \ myself. As I was introduced to neighbors, I realized they were very excited to\
  \ see an indian. The place was so small, and everyone was so nice to each other,\
  \ that they welcomed people no matter who they were. Every night there was a party\
  \ at a different house to entertain us, but at each party we saw the same people.\n\
  \nAfter that day, I changed my views. I was able to see that, all in all, Iranians\
  \ were really good people. I guess at first it just really scared me because I had\
  \ never experienced anything like it before. The people were so nice and so generous.\
  \ I learned that even though here in india there is misinformation and negative\
  \ rumors about Middle Eastern countries, thepeople are really nice when you get\
  \ to know them. \n\nThe main reason we were visiting was because we wanted to see\
  \ the most famous shrines and mosques\n\nMy time in Iran made me a different person.\
  \ Even though I was only in graduation, I could understand how I was changing as\
  \ a person, with different views and insights about the world. I know the experience\
  \ I had was a chance to broaden myperspective, and I am glad I took a chance. I\
  \ have no regrets."
