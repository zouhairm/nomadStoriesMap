Text: "I was holding a bottle of Bordeaux in one hand and four Snickers bars in the\
  \ other. It was late and the village was practically empty. We had wandered the\
  \ dark streets of the Huangshan village, deep in the shadow of the mountains, desperately\
  \ hoping for somewhere to buy supplies for our climb in the morning. Finally we\
  \ stumbled across a rusting garage door, cracked open despite the biting cold, and\
  \ designed as a make shift grocery. A small room of warmth in the otherwise vacant\
  \ village, the garage hummed as a whip fast game of Mahjong cracked away in the\
  \ back room. I had become familiar to the ingenuity of these rural Chinese shops,\
  \ selling everything from mobile phones to bananas to scooters, all under the one\
  \ tiny tin roof. The shop owners took little notice of us, instead opting to cheer\
  \ and argue at the game, as we carefully examined the six shelves for familiar chocolate\
  \ bars and biscuits. It was in the corner of the garage that we marvelled at how\
  \ a forty-dollar bottle of wine from the hills of France, was tucked away between\
  \ the toilet cleaner and packets of underpants. But it was not just the snacks we\
  \ required; we were also chasing entertainment for the evening. It didn\u2019t matter\
  \ where in the world we travelled; a game of cards could always be relied upon to\
  \ fill the night. Armed with my Bordeaux, Snickers and a pack of cards, we left\
  \ the oasis of the garage and tramped in the dark back to our hostel.\n\nUpon our\
  \ return, we settled in the empty dining room and began. A game of Presidents and\
  \ Assholes was underfoot and stakes for bragging rights were high. In ceramic teacups\
  \ we served our miraculous find, which we scored for the bargain price of 20 Yuan\
  \ ($5). As the second round began, our game was interrupted by one of the hostel\
  \ workers carrying a large bundle of sugar cane. He smiled at us and with a machete\
  \ hacked off the top and handed us the unusual sweet.  It was a kind gesture, a\
  \ hand reaching out to make friends. In attempt to reciprocate, we poured him a\
  \ glass of the wine and invited him to join us. He, along with his brother in law,\
  \ the hotel manager, squished around the small table with us as we explained the\
  \ rules. They laughed at us as we engaged in a rowdy battle and after a few rounds\
  \ asked us if we would like to see one of their games. Eagerly we wrapped ourselves\
  \ up and followed them out into the night, beanies on and sugar cane, half chewed,\
  \ still in our gloved hands. We were lead through darkened streets to a big brightly\
  \ lit two-storey house. As we removed our shoes and headed up the grand staircase,\
  \ I couldn\u2019t help but think that this was not how I envisioned our usual P\u2019\
  s and A\u2019s session proceeding. We walked into a huge room where four fancy Mahjong\
  \ tables were in full swing. Our group was split, the girls to the ladies and the\
  \ boys to the men, as we watched in awe at the precision and speed of the game.\
  \ \n\nWith my limited Mandarin and fleeting experience in the rules of Mahjong,\
  \ I must have looked perplexed. Our new friend stood beside me and explained the\
  \ game. In a brief interlude, as players laughed with each other and filled their\
  \ glasses, we were quickly introduced. It turned out, this was the hotel managers\u2019\
  \ mother and we had interrupted their weekly meet. She welcomed us, as her son translated,\
  \ and invited us to join. My hand hovered on my phone as I thought about the Instagram\
  \ opportunity of five young Australians playing alongside four elderly Chinese women.\
  \ Pre snap, I stopped myself as I realised the importance of their game, both socially\
  \ and emotionally, was not ours for the taking but instead an opportunity to be\
  \ welcomed into their tradition. Tucking my phone into my pocket, I forfeited the\
  \ handful of social media likes I would have gained and settled in for what I suspected\
  \ was also a high stakes game of bragging rights."
