Text: 'Travelling solo is not new for me, though it can be challenging for an asian
  , Philippines passport holder like me. Travelling to Thailand was not my first solo
  trip but the experience I got there was refreshing, experiencing new things is the
  reason why I love travelling especially alone. Pictures are mementos of every travel,
  but for me the experience I had will always be the best treasure, travelling makes
  me forget who and what I am for 5 days or so, I can be a free spirited invidual
  for just a moment. So going back to the days I travelled in Thailand, from day 1
  which I panicked because I can''t see my pick-up and the relief I felt when I was
  safely check-in in the hostel, what a mixed of emotion I got there, the place I
  stayed was cheap but very conveniemt for temple hoping being an asian tourist in
  asian country was fun though!they thought I was a Thailander so they are speaking
  to me in their local tongue and I was like " wait a sec I am Filipina" and they
  said "oh you have white skin" haha that racist you know! Kidding aside, temple hoppings,
  great food, nice people, cheap clothes and that elephant ride was a blast. Hope
  to travel again soon my target will be greece this year, and after watching korean
  drama encounter I had this urges to visit cuba.

  Cheers to more travel! Chow!'
