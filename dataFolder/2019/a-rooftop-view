Text: "I'll put it out there straight away. A lot of people travel to Mexico, however,\
  \ a lot of people travel to beach resorts and hotels for the sun, sand and sea.\
  \ Myself, I have done this twice, and loved it both times. Met the girl who would\
  \ become my girlfriend at one of these such hotels, and I'm always happy to stay\
  \ at one.\n\nThis isn't a story about that though. I make a tradition of travelling\
  \ to Mexico every December to visit my girlfriend and live with her family. This\
  \ story is about the time we visited Guanajuato.\n\nWhen you get to Guanajuato,\
  \ you can instantly tell that you're there by the distinctive building colours and\
  \ some of the narrowest roads of any city. When we arrived at the house we would\
  \ be living in for the next few days, the first thing that we did was walk out onto\
  \ the brick red roof. Under the beating sun that day, we shaded our eyes to gaze\
  \ out across the undulating, multitude of homes that spanned the colour spectrum.\
  \ Simply amazing. The city lies on and around hills, almost unlike any city I had\
  \ seen in Britain. If you looked in any direction there was a sprawling mass of\
  \ buildings and fantastical architecture which, (as someone who lives in a relatively\
  \ small town, and never felt at home in a city) was a strangely calming experience.\
  \ Despite being able to witness the bustling city below me filled with tourists\
  \ and residents rushing around as one and the same, I stood there, and just relaxed.\n\
  At that point, I realised that I've never seen somewhere as busy, yet calm. Beautiful\
  \ yet rugged. So open to tourism, yet such a natural place. I couldn't do anything\
  \ but grin in a strange, Cheshire cat type way.\n\nLooking out from a rooftop is\
  \ beautiful, but walking around in a city is so very different. The urban sprawl\
  \ was beautiful from our perch on our house, but it was equally incredible to venture\
  \ through the streets.\nWhen I had been looking from the roof, we could see everyone,\
  \ but down here, we were everyone; we were part of this entity flowing through the\
  \ streets, encompassed by the sheer height of the buildings. \nThis was not Birmingham\
  \ or London where it's everyone for themselves, each jockeying for a position on\
  \ the pavement to get to and from a 9-5 job. Here it was a smooth machine of each\
  \ individual passing by without any stuck-up British animosity. \n\nStanding on\
  \ that roof with my girlfriend was one moment, just a fraction of the time I would\
  \ spend there with her, and a minuscule section of my visit to Guanajuato, but it\
  \ is one of the most memorable moments.\n\nI never expected to be standing on the\
  \ roof of a building in a city of a country that I didn't speak the language of.\
  \ \nI never expected to have felt as comfortable as I did in a city.\nMost importantly,\
  \ I never didn't expect to look out at this city and feel like I belonged in that\
  \ moment.\n\nFor me, I believe that truly special moments may occur a few times\
  \ in life, but never occurring too often. They are distinct and discernable from\
  \ everything else. \nI know, that this moment was completely unexpected, but it\
  \ was supported by the people that I was with- my girlfriend and her family- just\
  \ as much as the people who wandered the streets at the same time as me in Guanajuato."
