Text: "I was about to do the most free-spirited think in my life and for some reason\
  \ and I wasn\xB4t even afraid. All I could feel was a great excitement of what was\
  \ coming \u2013 10 days of travels with no fixed plans and no money with a guy I\
  \ have just met. I was in Prague at the start of the Low-Cost Race where you travel\
  \ in pair to the checkpoints spread out around whole Europe fulfilling crazy challenges\
  \ on the way. I\xB4ve always enjoyed challenging myself, leaving the comfort zone\
  \ and doing something out of ordinary and I knew this race was a great chance to\
  \ enhance my confidence and to collect a series of unforgettable memories.\n\nTo\
  \ go on such an adventure with an unknown guy (my friend\xB4s friend to make it\
  \ more accurate) might not have been my original intention, but since I couldn\xB4\
  t find anyone courageous enough among my friends and I felt like the experience\
  \ I could gain from the race was worth the risk, I decided to with Pavel, even though\
  \ I\xB4ve never met him before. We named our team Strangers in Crime and were ready\
  \ to set off. \n\nAs I\xB4ve always been fascinated by the beauty of Switzerland,\
  \ we decided to make it our first goal. And because we were not allowed to use money\
  \ (we only had 100 euro for emergency reasons and we would get minus points if we\xB4\
  d come back with less) it was time to get my very first hitchhiking experience.\
  \ It took almost an hour of standing on a burning sun until a driver stopped for\
  \ and we almost didn\xB4t make it out of the Czech Republic the first day. But just\
  \ as we were losing our last hopes, looking for a place where to pitch a tent close\
  \ to a petrol station, we found another driver and ended up sleeping in the open\
  \ lake by a stunning lake in Germany just a couple km beyond the borders.\n\nThings\
  \ didn\xB4t go as we planned the following day or the day after, and the day after.\
  \ But that\xB4s where all the magic was. We would always wake up into a day full\
  \ of new stories, we couldn\xB4t plan who will we encounter, what will we eat, who\
  \ the next driver would be or where we will sleep and it forced us to live in the\
  \ moment, which was the best thing that could have happened to me. Yes, it was frustrating\
  \ sometimes. Standing for three hours on the road hitchhiking with no success is\
  \ tough especially when it\xB4s getting dark and you have no place to sleep, but\
  \ it was exactly at these moments when I would completely lose hope when something\
  \ magical would happen, and people would save us from the hopeless situation. I\
  \ could talk for hours about all the stories that we\xB4ve experienced, but it\xB4\
  s not just the stories, but it\xB4s the life-lessons that Low-Cost Race taught me,\
  \ which value the most.\n\nHitchhiking for over 8 500 km throughout Europe made\
  \ me experience, there are still many good people in this world, willing to selflessly\
  \ help strangers. I\xB4ve learned that where you travel to doesn\xB4t determinate\
  \ your experience nearly as much as what\xB4s your attitude \u2013 if I wanted other\
  \ people\u2019s help I had to bring along positive energy, I had to get out of my\
  \ comfort zone and reach out for help when I needed it. It made me believe in myself\
  \ more and it also made me live in the present moment more (how can you live in\
  \ the future if you don\xB4t know what comes next minute?) and appreciate the daily\
  \ blessings like getting a free ice cream, walking around Berlin with a local or\
  \ being invited for a lunch. And mainly, it taught me, that hard moments are followed\
  \ be the happy ones and I should never give up on myself and my dreams.\n\nI would\
  \ truly like to encourage everyone to fight their fears and do the same to go hitchhiking.\
  \ It will teach you a lot about yourself and the world, and you will get the kind\
  \ of knowledge, a school could never give you."
