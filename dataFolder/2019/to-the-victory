Text: "The music suddenly stopped playing. A strong and masculine voice quickly announced:\
  \ \u2018El Comandante ha muerto\u2019. \nWe looked at one another confused and stood\
  \ there frozen trying to digest what we just heard.\n\nEveryone stopped dancing.\
  \ We could see some people embracing their friends, others, tourists like us, probably\
  \ just thinking that there was a problem with the sound. We all started to leave\
  \ the club feeling disconcerted. \nOutside, in the streets of the lively and colourful\
  \ Trinidad, there was a silence. People walking out from the rest of the bars, whispering\
  \ about what just happened, but not a loud word uttered. \n\nIt was 12.30 AM local\
  \ time when we connected to the public, and only, wifi available in the city, which\
  \ we got for two pounds after queuing for half an hour under the Caribbean Sun that\
  \ same afternoon. \nThe news had not yet broken but for one of the main online encyclopedias\
  \ where it surprisingly stated: \"Fidel Castro - Died: 25 November 2016, Havana,\
  \ Cuba -\". \nAnd there we were, in the middle of one of the biggest days in the\
  \ history of not just Cuba but the World. \n\nThe next day, we woke up as every\
  \ morning during the past two weeks, with the smell of natural coffee and fresh\
  \ fruit, however, we promptly remembered what happened the night before. The revolutionary\
  \ and longest president of the country had just passed away, leaving the enemies\
  \ of the past, Communism and Capitalism, closer than they had ever been before.\
  \ \nDefinitely, this was a very different day than any other in over 52 years. \n\
  \nThe silence remained on the old worn streets. The owners of our \u2018casa particular\u2019\
  , an elderly skinny woman with long white hair and dark skin, and her exuberant\
  \ daughter, Yanet, were submerged in sadness and fear of the future to come. \n\
  That television, old as the government, was only showing documentaries of Fidel\
  \ Castro\u2019s life on repeat.\n\nWhile she was serving us the breakfast on the\
  \ main table upstairs, next to the rustic balcony, Yanet was explaining to us what\
  \ she thought may happen to the Cubans from now on, showing in every word her heartache\
  \ and respect for the regime. \n\"We will now be okay as Raul is still in power,\
  \ although he is closer to the United States than his brother was. They say that\
  \ when Raul will no longer be here, this new young man will take the power and everything\
  \ will change, for the worst\".\n\nThe neighbours were overwhelmed with grief. Maria,\
  \ who became a teacher thanks to Castro\u2019s allowance to free education, was\
  \ telling us in tears how grateful she and her husband were to the Commandant because\
  \ of their valuable jobs.\n\nJust one week before, in a blue American 50s classic\
  \ \u2018taxi colectivo\u2019 from Vi\xF1ales to Cayo Jut\xEDas (3 km-long blanket\
  \ of sand and turquoise waters), our driver, Salvador, was waiting to receive the\
  \ call from the Government to have the final interview after his application to\
  \ legally leave the country which could only be done under family reunification\
  \ circumstances. \n\nWhile we were arriving into paradise, he was relating how his\
  \ family had left the country unlawfully by boats, tired of the repression and lack\
  \ of basics in the supermarkets. They arrived in Miami seeking freedom; they were\
  \ now there living the American dream.\n\nSalvador\u2019s day consists of driving\
  \ tourists from their accommodation to their next stop, 50 km away. As the trip\
  \ is too expensive to return, he spends his time shading himself under a tree until\
  \ the passengers are ready to go back to town.\nAlthough this sounds like a dream\
  \ job, I clearly understood his reasons to leave the country, as well as I sympathized\
  \ with the tears of Maria and Yanet. \n\n\"There is a fear that this will tear Cuban\
  \ society apart\", Raul Castro."
