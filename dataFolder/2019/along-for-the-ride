Text: "There's a wonderful bridge that crosses over the top of the tracks at the Galle\
  \ Fort station in Colombo. Locals in their bright colours unload from the trains\
  \ below me, off to work, off to school, and some back into another carriage. A mass\
  \ swarm of energy moving. Everyone just trying to get somewhere else. \n\n I arrived\
  \ at the train station early incase the line for a ticket was long. And to observe.\
  \ \nThe bridge is the perfect place to stand and wait: above the trains and out\
  \ of the way, watching the comings and goings, the chaotic order. \n I see other\
  \ tourists arrive, flustered, determined. They run for their platforms wanting to\
  \ be first in line for a seat and the incredible views on route. \nThere's a local\
  \ man I notice, perched by the tea room waiting, he's watching me watch. I see him\
  \ and I smile. He returns it. \n\nTime goes on, my train comes and we somehow all\
  \ clamber on dispersing among its great length. Having a small amount of luggage\
  \ in transit is a bonus here, because trains are popular and the likelihood of having\
  \ a seat (or extra space) is little to none. The minimal belongings I have are packed\
  \ into an even tighter close unit so it doesn't drape off the side of the bag racking\
  \ in second class ...lesson learned. I ground in my standing spot behind a young\
  \ couple. One hand on the top of her seat, one grasping the hanging strap. Someone\
  \ tries to squeeze behind me, I've been here long enough to now know we can always\
  \ fit one more in. \nI blink my eyes shut and breathe, clinging on. Inhaling Sri\
  \ Lanka and embracing it, \n\nAs the train moves on, I glance around, surrounded\
  \ by people living their day to day lives. This is why I'm here, to join the adventure,\
  \ living mine."
