Text: "Do you know the meaning of \u201Cprecious\u201D? Ok, i\xB4m going to tell you.\
  \ Excellent, worthy of apreciation, with high value, so beautiful.\n\nI just travel\
  \ to Cuba and doing a comparation with other trips that I\xB4ve made and I realized\
  \ that Cuba was totally different. From US and Canada I brougth souvenirs, I learned\
  \ the education level that they have, I enjoyed to see their houses and streets,\
  \ I love Disneyland (it\xB4s a magic place) but Cuba, it\xB4s a different story.\n\
  \nTheir people is incredible, cheerful, they talk to you as if you were a friend\
  \ of years, they love that you love their country, actually they really love their\
  \ country. The cultural and academic education level that the cubans have is really\
  \ awesome.\n\nWhile I were in the Che Guevara\xB4s bar called \u201C\xC1ngel del\
  \ Tejadillo\u201D, I met Mr. Jos\xE9, he started telling me the Cuba history and\
  \ how cubans are so grateful about the existence of Mexico, thanks to that, the\
  \ Cuban Revolution began. In Tuxpan, Veracruz Che Guevara and Fidel Castro met each\
  \ other and sailed on the yacht called Granma, this yacht is in the Revolution museum\
  \ carefully protect, like a treasure. While Mr. Jos\xE9 was telling me this story\
  \ his eyes were shinning, I felt the passion and proud in his heart so I decided\
  \ to invite him a \u201Cmojito\u201D (the typical beverage in Cuba). I arrived at\
  \ the bar at 3pm and I left at 6pm. \n\nI was in Cuba on January 8, the day that\
  \ Fidel Castro arrived in a caravan announcing that the revolution won, so every\
  \ person was reunited in front of the Revolution Museum commemortating the date.\
  \ A beautiful woman was singing in honor of the persons who gave their lifes for\
  \ their country. After a speech full of love and proud the celebration ended. \n\
  \nInsecure or harassment? Those words doesn\xB4t exist. Those acts doesn\xB4t exist.\
  \ You can walk at 3am without problem or fear, you can enjoy their streets at night\
  \ with people singing and dancing with a speaker on their shoulders with the volume\
  \ at full.\n\nTheir beaches shows you what is the meaning of peaceful and color\
  \ blue. You can rest in a trunk and enjoy the sound of the waves, the sand is so\
  \ fine that when you put your feet in the sea it feels like quicksand and you sink\
  \ little by little, everything surrounder with the purest blue in the water and\
  \ in the sky. \n\nOther day I went at \u201CHotel Nacional\u201D a classic of La\
  \ Habana, incredible inside and out. Destiny takes me to the bar, in my defense\
  \ I wasn\xB4t look for it. I try the best mojito ever, prepared with two \u201C\
  rones\u201D (the typical alcohol of Cuba, like tequila in Mexico <3). I took a sit\
  \ and I started to enjoy my mojito like it was the last one on desert. Suddenly\
  \ two beautiful ucranian women arrive at the bar and one of them say \u201Chi\u201D\
  \ and I was like \u201C who? me?\u201D. After a couple hours we started to dance\
  \ and sing, they invited me a Cohiba pure, better known as \u201Chabano\u201D, Cohiba\
  \ was the favourite of Fidel Castro. Two mojitos and two daiquiris after three musicians\
  \ came with us, I don\xB4t know how or where they como from but my new friends paid\
  \ them to sing any song for us. \n\nLet\xB4s take a moment here and imagine the\
  \ scene: emblematic Hotel Nacional, in the bar with sea view, with a mojito of cuban\
  \ ron in a hand, a Cohiba pure in the other and with cuban music play by cubans\
  \ musicians while we danced and laughed. It was THE moment.\n\nI could invite you\
  \ a cup of coffe or tea and talk all day about this magic and beautiful country\
  \ and make you feel like you was there with me. And in Cuba there is no internet\
  \ so you live every moment, really, you live it, you live Cuba.\n\nSo, what did\
  \ I brought from Cuba? Magic moments, peace, happiness, history, the joy of cubans\
  \ when they know that I am mexican, their music, their nights, their passion and\
  \ love for life."
