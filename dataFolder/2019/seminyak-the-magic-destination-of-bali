Text: "Travel notes from one of the most mesmerizing Indonesian cities, Seminyak.\n\
  \nThe world is full of incredible spots, but Mother Nature gifted humanity with\
  \ a dreamy magic land, located between the Java and Lombok island: Bali. \nThe island\
  \ represents the perfect geography of paradise on Earth. \nNo wonder why this treasure\
  \ is called the Island Of The Gods. Its strong religious spirituality blends with\
  \ thousands of temples that are on the island.\nThere are many incredible Indonesian\
  \ destinations not to be missed, such as Ubud, Denpasar, Kuta, Sanur. \n\nFasten\
  \ your seat belts, your are about to land on Seminyak, the modern city located in\
  \ the south west coast of Bali, Indonesia, just north of Kuta and Legian. \nNgurah\
  \ Rai International Airport, also known as Denpasar Airport, is the closest one\
  \ nearby Seminyak. \nYou just forget the sad grey city you left behind with the\
  \ breathtaking ocean view.\nThe stamp on the passport is the entry ticket to heaven.\
  \ And it designs a natural smile on your lips.\nI have just few days here in Seminyak,\
  \ thus the best has to be experienced and discovered. \nMagic words are: discovery,\
  \ adventure, colors, culture, ocean view, spirituality, traditions.\n\nWhat about\
  \ accomodation? Magic begins in the moment you step into amazing peaceful villas.\
  \ The incredible view of vibrant green belonging to a landscape garden welcomes\
  \ you in the best way. It looks like Mother Nature is keeping all the luminous light\
  \ in this place. Wooden roof, small pool, guardian statues to watch over you, dreamy\
  \ bedroom and open space is better than a 5* hotel. \nEspecially at night, when\
  \ you look up to the sky and million stars are above your head, right before your\
  \ very eyes. \nBalinese architecture has the power to instill a calm and relaxing\
  \ feeling, a peaceful atmosphere, and be interconnected with the earth and balance\
  \ the inner energy while enjoy mother nature. \nThis is pure luxury.\n\nForget sneakers\
  \ or fancy shoes, put on your flip flops. Adventure is calling.\nGoing around Seminyak,\
  \ there's this caf\xE9+restaurant called Caf\xE9 Bali, located on Oberoi Street.\n\
  Perfect interiors, design, and style. A peaceful mood and a warm atmosphere, good\
  \ food and nice smiley people working in this beautiful place.\nFresh marigold flowers\
  \ fill the rooms. \nIt's time to have breakfast just near by the flowered Ganesha\
  \ Hindu Elephant God statue triumphant on water. \nGanesha represents the God of\
  \ Good Fortune, the Lord of Beginnings and the Remover of Obstacles. \nEveryone\
  \ should have breakfast here. Not just a place, but a state of mind. \n\nAnother\
  \ place to stop by is Pandawa beach, located on Bali\u2019s southern Bukit Peninsula.\
  \ You can rent a motorbike or you can bargain a good price with the taxi driver\
  \ who can wait for you while you dive in the cristalline blue ocean waves. \nWelcome\
  \ drink is a delicious coconut water and a peaceful front row to the ocean view\
  \ show. Nothing else to add.\n\nSeminyak represents also to taste delightful exotic\
  \ dishes, to go shopping and breathing an everlasting feeling of blend of western+eastern\
  \ atmosphere, from architecture to stores. \nWalking on the streets, you see locals\
  \ with big warm smiles, Poleng checked cloth draped over the statues and small decorative\
  \ square-shaped palm basket filled with colored flowers, symbols of religious gratitude\
  \ and protection. \nDo not forget to experience Padang Padang Beach, locally referred\
  \ to as Pantai Labuan Sait, located on the north-western coast of the island\u2019\
  s Bukit Peninsula. Padang Padang means 'slowly slowly'. So, take your time, take\
  \ it slowly, and simply enjoy what happens at the sunset time, around  6.15-7 pm.\n\
  When the sun goes down, the sun kisses the rocks, turning them into gold, and its\
  \ show ends when all the soft shades of violets, purples, greens and cyans shine\
  \ and radiate pure love. \nAn emotional work of art.\nBali means also treat: a traditional\
  \ spa at Bodyworks, plus a drink after at La Plancha, La Favela, Ku De Ta, W Bali\
  \ Seminyak, etc.\nI am blessed and full of gratitude.\nYou will be grateful for\
  \ everything you will experience here.\n\nBali is a pure work of Art, painted with\
  \ all the most beautiful colors.\n\nTerima kasih (banyak) (it means 'thank you so\
  \ much') Seminyak!"
