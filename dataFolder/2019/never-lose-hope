Text: "It has been a year when my Dad just passed away from serious ailment. Very\
  \ sad to tell that promised suddenly just disappear after long time working in a\
  \ foreign land but apparently his leaving us. It was the moment I keep on asking\
  \ myself \u201CI suppose to do it the soonest\u201D before things gonna happen.\
  \ I am always keep on blaming myself why I did not do it when he is still alive.\
  \ Losing someone special is like loosing half of my life. Things change and everything\
  \ gonna happen for a reason. I came back to Dubai withh a grief of memories but\
  \ I did not give ul. I know Dad is very happy when I am happy. The love of Dad\u2019\
  s traveling is what I love too. I did not give up. So I decided myelf to travel\
  \ alone, to see myself again. To see and conquer the world with the happiness bringing\
  \ on me and my family. First trip which I did by myself from booking airline to\
  \ accommodations was traveling to Malaysia and Singapore. Ive been staying in kuala\
  \ Lumpur for two days and heading to Singapore for a week. I am so lucky to explore\
  \ this small country. By the time I step in the airport it is totally blown me away.\
  \ Changi Aiport was huge, fully carpeted and is well organize. Everyhting is fully\
  \ detailed. I can Imagine, this is just the airport how much more the rest of Singapore.\
  \ One thing I notice in common is that old people are still working, which makes\
  \ me wonder and still walking with a question. Commuting is not a hassle, rail line\
  \ is already connected from the airport and throughout the city. Very easy cor the\
  \ solo traveler like me. Unluckily I book a cheap lodge but not a big deal as long\
  \ as I can sleep and continue exploring the place. Tourist attractions are just\
  \ connected as well, very easy. You can walk around freely and safely. Evrything\
  \ is clean and orderly. Singaporeans are really discipline. I went to see the merlion\
  \ on the first through walking, which is just quite near, walking along boat quay\
  \ which offers variety of pubs and restaurants. You will see fresh lobster, crabs\
  \ and other seafoods everywhere. Before reaching to merlion, I dropped over to one\
  \ Indian Restaurant which cooked delicious and spciy Nase Goreng. After filling\
  \ my stomach I go across tall buildings and finally the Merlion Park which their\
  \ land mark and just 10-15 minutes away, I reach Marina Bay Sand and at the back\
  \ is the beautifu Gardens by the Bay so relaxing. Second day, I went to Sentosa\
  \ which is home of Universal Studio and exciting beach getaway. Did not stay for\
  \ so long,since Im getting bored. I headed back to Little India and Chinatown which\
  \ I spend longer busy looking for souvenirs . Its quite interesting lot of choices.\
  \ Third day , i went to The Orchards garden to get to know more of orchid specie,\
  \ beautiful and close nature. Its a huge park good for families outing. Neigboring\
  \ place is the orchard street which is home of some luxurious shops and where my\
  \ \u201Ckabayans working as well. Most importantly I had met my cousin as well.\
  \ Sibgapore is one of my favorite place so far which brought to my attentiin to\
  \ come back with my Mom and my Siblings. Wonderful place and highly recommended"
