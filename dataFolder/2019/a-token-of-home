Text: "Books, clocks, trains-I had chased them all in London. Tirelessly. Endlessly.\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t recognise a Sunday if it stared me in my face. Insanity was lurking\
  \ nearby. \u201CGet out before it\u2019s too late!\u201D  So I packed my bags and\
  \ embarked upon a spontaneous, hastily planned solo trip (my first ever!) on a modest\
  \ budget, in a country without the prying eyes of distant Indian relatives. Alone\
  \ but liberated. \n\nThe afternoon sun penetrated the airtight windows and pierced\
  \ my half-open, drowsy eyes as I lay in my seat. The heat felt familiar, reminding\
  \ me of Indian summers. Deep blue water sparkled under the scorching Croatian sun,\
  \ almost within reach as the bus wound down the rocky green hills. Below, a few\
  \ quaint houses with red terracotta roofs and white walls, clustered together hugging\
  \ the sea. \nA sudden halt jolts both serenity and sleep out of me. A pale skinned,\
  \ tall built man with distant grey eyes, stiff lips and dull brown hair entered\
  \ the bus and made his way to my seat. Written in white across his navy blue uniform\
  \ was \u2018Policija\u2019. I didn\u2019t know any Croatian but understood it meant\
  \ Police. \n\u201CIdentity.\u201D\nSlightly intimidated, I asked \u201CPassport?\u201D\
  \nHe nods. Rummaging through my bag, I handed him my passport nervously. Taking\
  \ it, he opened the visa page, stared at me, then turned wordlessly and left the\
  \ bus! Disquieted at the separation from my passport, I could not dare to call him\
  \ out. Instead, I turned to a friendly looking Canadian named Ben seated close-by\
  \ who was on a backpacking trip across Europe. \n\u201CWhy did he take our passports?\u201D\
  \n\u201CBecause this is the Zaton Doli checkpoint. We are entering Neum in Bosnia.\u201D\
  \n\u201CWhat! Isn\u2019t this bus headed to Split?\u201D\nHe smiled. \u201CYou must\
  \ pass through Bosnia to reach Split. There\u2019s no other way.\u201D\nBaffled,\
  \ I checked the map of Croatia on my phone, realising what he meant. While we waited\
  \ at the busy checkpoint, Ben turned out to be quite chatty; he talked of the Bosnian\
  \ war in the early \u201890s when Yugoslavia was dissolved, and the conflict between\
  \ Croatia and Bosnia during that time. I listened to how ego and power politics\
  \ added one more war in history, with the same outcome. Genocide spilling blood\
  \ that was red in the end. The irony was that this was done to create a \u201Chomeland\u201D\
  \ of one ethnicity, the cost of which was forced emigration and the loss of countless\
  \ homes to create a new one. \n\nIt was a while before it struck me that the bus\
  \ had been moving all this time, and I DID NOT HAVE MY PASSPORT! Panic seized me,\
  \ while all reason escaped me. Frantically, I turned to Ben. He had dozed off in\
  \ his seat. Straining my neck to see if he had his passport, I saw none. But then\
  \ again who keeps a passport on display! Maybe he had his. Perhaps everyone had\
  \ it except me. As that unsettling thought sank in, a wave of loneliness drowned\
  \ me. Although suffocated and subdued in India, now trapped in a country that offered\
  \ liberation, I wanted to be home, only it felt even further away in that moment.\
  \ \u201CThis trip was a bad idea!\u201D Dismayed, I curled up in my seat, tears\
  \ gushing down my face.\n\nWhen the reservoir ran dry, I resolved to confront the\
  \ driver. I marched to the front of the bus and somewhat shrieked at him, demanding\
  \ we go back. It was pointless. He didn\u2019t speak English. Unwilling to give\
  \ up on my home, I pleaded to go back, hoping emotion would overcome the language\
  \ barrier. He frowned, looking right behind me. I turned to see passports strewn\
  \ on the front seat which had completely evaded my vision in my march of fury to\
  \ him. A passport with the Indian emblem peeked at me. I flopped in the seat next\
  \ to it, flooded with relief. Gazing out of the window at the few solitary fishing\
  \ boats bobbing merrily in the blue waters of the Adriatic sea, all tension dissipates,\
  \ my body unwinding at last. Just then, the bus approaches the exit checkpoint at\
  \ Klek, my piece of home safely and tightly clutched in my hand."
