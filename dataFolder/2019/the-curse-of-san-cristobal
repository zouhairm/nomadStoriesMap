Text: "San Crist\xF3bal de las Casas, the birthplace of the Zapatista movement and\
  \ the southern capital of amber stones, is also the setting of a defiant duel between\
  \ embracing my past and the greatest aluxe protecting the city in between the mountains\
  \ against anyone who doesn\u2019t respect San Crist\xF3bal\u2019s mysticism.\n\n\
  My father\u2019s family was born and raised in this under 200.000 resident city.\
  \ Sometime around the \u201980s, they moved to Tuxtla Guti\xE9rrez, 30 minutes away\
  \ from San Crist\xF3bal. Since I live in Mexico City, whenever we would visit the\
  \ family they would encourage us to take a one-day trip to San Cristobal due to\
  \ its remarkable charm. \n\nThe thing is that, as I mentioned before, the protecting\
  \ force of this allegedly charming city was forbidding my entry in the form of multiple\
  \ diseases. Every time I would go to San Crist\xF3bal I would get really sick. First,\
  \ it was stomach aches. Then, it was headaches. Once I started peeing blood for\
  \ no apparent reason, which then stopped as I went back to my hometown. I even remember\
  \ lying in bed all night screaming because of unbearable joint pain on my knees\
  \ two years ago. It would all happen after visiting San Crist\xF3bal. It would all\
  \ happen as I watched all my family staring at me with disbelief. \n\nLast year\
  \ my best friend and I planned a trip all over southeast Mexico which would obviously\
  \ include San Crist\xF3bal. This time, we would stay for at least two days straight\
  \ wandering around its alleys and steep streets and visiting nearby indigenous towns.\
  \ One of which, wouldn\u2019t allow any pictures due to the local residents' belief\
  \ that photographs can take away a person\u2019s soul. \n\nShortly after arriving\
  \ I started feeling a little lightheaded. The spirit of the aluxe was awake.\nThen,\
  \ we were looking for a hotel to stay in. None would look reasonably comfortable\
  \ and cheap and most of them were in full capacity. Now the spirit was throwing\
  \ obstacles in our way. We then decided to make one short trip to an indigenous\
  \ town 20 minutes away to have one new memory to share. But the aluxe was determined\
  \ to not let us find the little brown bus that would take us there for 17 pesos.\
  \ Locals would tell us that the situation was very unlikely and we should be able\
  \ to find it in short notice. \n\nWe were about to give up and go back to Tuxtla\
  \ when we found the bus around the corner just about to exit. We hopped in and were\
  \ in San Juan Chamula in a matter of minutes. No pictures allowed. Predominantly\
  \ indigenous town. Few people in the main plaza. The church was the only thing in\
  \ front of us. As we entered we were guided by a man who would explain the rituals\
  \ of the people living in Chamula whilst showing the slaughtering of a rooster happening\
  \ in the background. That would serve as an offering hoping to cure a sick child.\n\
  \nInstead of feeling afraid, for the first time, I felt a lot of relief. In spite\
  \ of the no photos policy, a lot of tourists had snapped a picture while no one\u2019\
  s watching. The ones that are found online can never fully embody how the overall\
  \ spirit of community felt at that church, which was no traditional one. Full of\
  \ candles, leaves, fruits and undoubtedly, protecting spirits.\n\n\nI realized that\
  \ the rooster perishing was, in a way, also the fear I had melting away. That big\
  \ \u201Cmonster\u201D had always been on my mind and through my eyes, I would see\
  \ everything with an unrealistic horrifying filter, nurtured by a lack of empathy.\
  \ The sick me was just the Antonio who wouldn\u2019t accept my heritage linked to\
  \ the city. A part of me that was feeling relentlessly rejected by a town who had\
  \ been part of my origins, and someone who had never opened his eyes to a place\
  \ of such power. A place that by testing my health was just trying to make me as\
  \ strong as its residents. \n\nNeedless to say, after that evening I've no longer\
  \ felt sick while being in San Crist\xF3bal or by connecting with my empowering\
  \ Chiapanecan roots."
