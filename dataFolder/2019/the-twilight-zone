Text: "After eight days, three in Fez and five in the Sahara, we felt like we had,\
  \ 'traveling Morocco' in the bag.  \n\nOur small group in Fez. led by a local guide,\
  \ who also slept at our Riad, stood by our sides as we negotiated, led us to the\
  \ best restaurants and hammams, grew more confident as each day passed.  We all\
  \ purchased djellabas and headscarves so we could blend into and respect the local\
  \ culture, and mastered some essential words with which to order food, a room, and\
  \ say thank you, 'shukaran', 'afwan'. \n\nOur guided drive from Fez to Hasselblad\
  \ was beautiful and uneventful, stopping to eat or stretch in pre-arranged villages\
  \ which were obviously expecting us, refreshment in the form of mint tea, couscous,\
  \ and tagines....and shopping for babouche slippers, honey, and argan oil.  In Hasselblad\
  \ and at our Sahar Camp we 'roughed' it ....glamping!  flush toilets, beds, cotton\
  \ sheets, showers, and amazing food,  at least we could boast having traversed the\
  \ sand dunes by camel.  So, when we emerged from our dessert experience  (I do now\
  \ write this with tongue in cheek)  we felt ready to embrace the next leg of our\
  \ journey 'The Atlas Mountains', solo.\n\nThree inconspicuous middle-aged, very\
  \ white, blue-eyed women driving a bright blue rental off into the mountains with\
  \ a map, lonely planet guide, a few snacks and bottles of water. What we knew was:\
  \ the roads through the mountains are somewhat unpredictable, judging distances\
  \ can be challenging and don't drive at night.  We were free, free from our families\
  \ our children, our guide, our lives, we were together on an adventure, for once\
  \ we had no plans, flying by the seats of our pants and loving it until we weren't!\
  \  \n\nThere is limited accommodation in the 'off the beaten path' villages through\
  \ the Atlas Mountains and without a booking turning up at dusk expecting to find\
  \ something resembling comfortable, by western standards, a little challenging,\
  \ but we embraced the dormitories offered us and celebrated our new found liberation\
  \ until we came to a village not far from Imlil.  It was dark, we had left it far\
  \ too long to find somewhere to sleep, and there were no signs to indicate rest\
  \ stops, when, out of nowhere, a beacon of light, brilliance drawing us into......a\
  \ hotel, a hotel in the absolute middle of nowhere, a huge, marble faced hotel with\
  \ a Scarlet O'Hara staircase which led us to an enormous, decadent foyer, gleaming,\
  \ inviting and....empty.  A beautiful young Moroccan Woman shyly and hesitantly\
  \ welcomed us in.  They had rooms available, we were thrilled, showers, comfy beds,\
  \ dinner, we had landed the jackpot.  Our room was impressive, huge and ornate,\
  \ but it wasn't gleaming, the beds were crumpled, not the hospital corner, taut\
  \ look of a freshly made hotel bed, not the sparkling shower cubicle and new soap\
  \ bar, something wasn't quite right.  We enquired of our host, were taken to another\
  \ room, same look, same feel, then another, and another....we entered the twilight\
  \ zone, three floors, 10 rooms on each floor, none were clean and there were no\
  \ linens on the premises.  Cockroaches were following us from room to room, as were\
  \ the eyes of the two men we had caught a glimpse of packing bear into crates and\
  \ out the back door.  Something wasn't quite right.  From the corner of our eyes\
  \ we could see a Women approaching, could see her hair, her arms, her skin, she\
  \ embraced us and whispered...Chikhat, Abu Hurayrah - Our 'Lady of the Night' was\
  \ encouraging us to 'speak what is good and beneficial; at the same time warning,\
  \ cautioning us to be careful in what we say, lest we say something that is harmful\
  \ or false.  We left the men and women of this Bordello to their evening adventures,\
  \ climbed the stairs, put a chair against the door of our room and slept."
