Text: "Traveling to a new country is always weird: different people, different language,\
  \ different streets. You go with a hope to find the ideal dream you were imagining.\
  \ Reality is different, it\u2019s scary and grey, unless you look at it from a different\
  \ angle. \n My first trip to China land of pandas and great food, great wall and\
  \ avatar park.  What can go wrong? A dream trip.\n Started my traveling 2 days before\
  \ my birthday, had 16 hours flight to Beijing city, spend the night in a strangers\
  \ home with cockroaches all over the place, spent my birthday on a nine hour train\
  \ ride to Fujian Province, God it was memorable.  \n Was disappointing and sad,\
  \ my mom called me to wish me a happy birthday, I have started weeping.  I have\
  \ reached my destination, someone picked me up took me to my apartment. We have\
  \ got there and she had a candle and a cupcake for me. The world turned upside down.\
  \ I looked at the light and my mind went back to the first day: met a Chinese movie\
  \ maker, who was traveling in Spain with his crew, on my 16 hour flight to Beijing,\
  \ stranger who picked me up at the airport was a girl who hosted me that night for\
  \ nothing in exchange, scary guy sitting next to me on the train was the guys who\
  \ helped me to find my stop. \n I blew my candle and my wish was to see the bigger\
  \ picture.\nI stayed in the unknown land for two years, leaving the place was harder\
  \ then arrival."
