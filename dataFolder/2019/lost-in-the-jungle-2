Text: "It was evening in Bangkok when I took the train to go to Chang Mai, in the\
  \ north of Thailand, my incredibile adventure started with a 14 hours train trip\
  \ during the night.\n\nI went to Thailand to meet a friend of mine, she lives and\
  \ work in Bangkok in a bank, she was on vacation and we traveled across the country\
  \ for 10 days together, 10 unforgettable days.\n\nBack to the train, it was the\
  \ first time that I experienced a night trip in a train like that, we had our bedroom\
  \ and it was comfortable even if it was cold inside the train.\nI felt very excited\
  \ because every time that I looked out I was able to see natural landscapes shining\
  \ with the moonlight, a lot of vegetation, lost in a country from the other side\
  \ of the world, I didn\u2019t mentioned, I\u2019m italian.\n\nWe woke up early in\
  \ the morning and we enjoyed the trip, we were lost, peaceful and we spend a lot\
  \ of time looking outside of the windows, I\u2019ll never forget that feeling, like\
  \ kids during a dream.\n\nWe arrived in Chang Mai, it was about midday and I knew\
  \ she booked the accomodation for us, she said she had booked something special\
  \ for the following day, then we ate delicious local food and we spent the day in\
  \ a cool hotel with the swimming pool and we visited some temples and viewpoints\
  \ and finally the university and its fantastic lake.\n\nThe following day we woke\
  \ up very early as always and we went to the bus station, we had to go to the north,\
  \ Chang Dao and Chang Rai, not so distant from Myanmar and Laos.\n\nThe trip was\
  \ adventurous and we ate in a tipical old thai restaurant before to take a taxi,\
  \ I mean a small old bus that brought us before to visit some beautiful caves, then\
  \ on the top of a mountain, in a small village with a difficult pronunciation name,\
  \ a camping where nobody spoke english, no foreigners, I felt completely lost in\
  \ the wild and I liked that feeling.\n\nI was surprised, even more when a young\
  \ man who was sitting in a kind of reception point showed us our accomodation, a\
  \ old and tipical small house of the jungle, imagine it and connect with the situation\
  \ to understand my feelings, I felt very happy and a little bit shocked but I had\
  \ only good feelings.\n\nDuring the afternoon we explored the village, we met wild\
  \ cats and dogs, very cute animals, we ate barbecue sitting outside of our little\
  \ house, looking the sunset then the shining stars, being careful of all the animals\
  \ around we finished soon to eat and brought the food back to a small shop we found\
  \ there, it wasn\u2019t a shop, it was a house where a family used to cook barbecue\
  \ for the tourists in the camping or the village, we discovered it only because\
  \ we walked around the area.\n\nI was a little scared at night after a fantastic\
  \ and relaxing day because we could heard all the jungle sounds, majestic place\
  \ full of wild life.\n\nIn the morning I didn\u2019t expect to find something like\
  \ that, the best view that I\u2019ve ever seen, we opened the door and the sun was\
  \ rising and shining everywhere in the valley, I felt grateful and connected to\
  \ the nature.\n\nI experienced the freedom and we shared a fantastic breakfast outside\
  \ with the company of a small cat we ate a omelette and some vegetables with hot\
  \ tea.\n\nI went for a walk and I felt so good, I spent some of the best time of\
  \ my life there, in some hours after a cold shower we prepared to continue our trip.\n\
  \nWe continued our trip and I visited other incredible places during my vacation\
  \ there but I\u2019ll never forget that jungle, that freedom.\n\nEverything is connected\
  \ and we have to be grateful to be alive and share our world with positivity, this\
  \ trip changed my life in a better way and I hope this story could ispire other\
  \ people to grow and live adventures around this beautiful world."
