Text: "When embarking on an adventure you\u2019ve been planning for over a year there\
  \ is always the danger of disappointment. Disappointment is the enemy of adventure\
  \ in the way that you are constantly fighting the desire to look back and compare\
  \ your experience to what you expected instead of focusing on what\u2019s right\
  \ in front of you. Argentina was almost like that for me. During my 10 month stay\
  \ I had expected to explore the country, have wild adventures, and return home almost\
  \ like a character from a movie, breathtakingly wise and full of stories. What I\
  \ found was something that should have been incredibly obvious to me, it was life.\
  \ The narrative of travel stories is so often full of exoticism, a never ending\
  \ highlight reel of good food and funny cultural quirks, gorgeous sights and larger\
  \ than life natives. What every traveler has to learn at some point is that no matter\
  \ what country you go to, the people are just people, they\u2019re just living.\
  \ I was eighteen when I left for Argentina. I had travelled before when I was younger\
  \ and had been waiting eagerly to go somewhere, anywhere, to get out of my Pacific\
  \ Northwest city. When I walked out into the airport of Rosario, the city that would\
  \ be my home for the next 10 months, I saw a crowd of people I had not expected.\
  \ Two host families, two exchange students, another family that I wouldn\u2019t\
  \ live with but would become very dear to me simply because like all of them they\
  \ cared about me. This caring was something overwhelming I had not expected and\
  \ didn\u2019t know how to understand or accept at first. I was used to cynical big\
  \ city passive aggression, not this automatic love that I received. I had long conversations\
  \ with another exchange student, a Danish boy who I became good friends with, about\
  \ this very topic. We would sit and discuss this affection and whether it was genuine\
  \ or not. We both had a hard time understanding this aspect of the Argentine culture.\
  \ After almost a year with these people though I learned to see the different layers\
  \ to it. I learned to express my love for my families the way that they expressed\
  \ their love for me. This love protected me from falling head first into the expectations\
  \ I had set for my trip and the dissapointment that lurked nearby always. The struggle\
  \ of feeling like I was experiencing *enough* to really be called a traveler. The\
  \ connections I formed were worth more than any flashy story I could tell to my\
  \ friends back home. Because of the bonds I made I was able to do what I hadn\u2019\
  t realized before was ultimately the goal, which was to just live. Traveling shouldn\u2019\
  t be like a competition to see who can see more impressive things (although those\
  \ are fulfilling as well) it should be to build connections and find love in whatever\
  \ form that takes. I will never compare my travels to anyone else\u2019s because\
  \ I know that the worth I find in them is what I get out of them. Disappointment\
  \ and comparison have no place in the relationships I form and I would never give\
  \ those relationships up for anything, as I know now that they are what makes it\
  \ all worth it."
