Text: "Just imagine my inhuman excitement when I realized that I was going to Sziget\
  \ - my dream event - alone. I knew my friends were going there as well but we traveled\
  \ separately and I was on my own most of the time.\n\nI'm a risk-taker and I usually\
  \ book accommodation, flights etc on the \"deadline\" and it always goes well. But\
  \ this time I wasn't that lucky. \n\nI was a bit over-self-confident to find a hotel,\
  \ apartment or a single room in August when the largest European music fest is in\
  \ 2 days. Who on Earth would think it was all booked month in advance? \n\nThanks\
  \ to his majesty Internet and all the kind people over there, I knew that there's\
  \ such a helping hand as Couchsurfing. Neither my parents nor my boyfriend knew\
  \ I was going to Hungary with no accommodation booked. And that made my trip mu-u-u-u-uch\
  \ easier. No one even wondered if I had booked a hotel or something. (The less they\
  \ know - the better)\n\nSo I anxiously started searching for someone who could host\
  \ me for those several festive days in Budapest. It didn't take a lot of time, but\
  \ still, it was intense. What if I hadn't found any place to live? Spending three\
  \ nights in a box didn't seem a nice option. Even in Budapest. \n\nThe other stressful\
  \ point was that I don't know those people. What if they're maniacs, killers or\
  \ just bad and unfriendly? But once again, my luck is my treasure. \n\nIn less than\
  \ a couple of hours, I found a nice guy living in the very downtown. And he offered\
  \ me to live there for free. Thank God, there's Couchsurfing! There was no better\
  \ option than that. I immediately agreed.\n\nWhat surprised me is that people offered\
  \ me to stay at their places even more than I asked. They wrote to me, and not I.\
  \ It's cool that you can write in your profile about your following trip and people\
  \ do offer me. The world isn't out of kindness!\n\nStill, the anxiety didn't disappear\
  \ completely. When I arrived in Budapest and reached my destination, I couldn't\
  \ help but overthink: what if I made the wrong decision? Who could help me if something\
  \ went wrong? But then I met my host and sighed with relief. He was shorter than\
  \ me and very skinny (so that I could defend myself easily, haha). \n\nTo say that\
  \ I had a marvelous time in Hungary is to say nothing. My host was friendly and\
  \ not that talkative (and it was cool as I was usually tired each time I returned\
  \ home), the flat was minimalistic and I loved it! In the very heart of Budapest,\
  \ it couldn't be better. And that's all for free, amazing! \n\nThis was my first\
  \ Couchsurfing experience and it was fantastic! All my fears were absolutely unjustified\
  \ and all the expectations - completely fulfilled. This was a real leap into the\
  \ unknown and this was worth it. Definitely."
