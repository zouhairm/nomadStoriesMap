Text: "Transportation in India is tricky. Sometimes it doesn\u2019t matter how far\
  \ in advance you book things; trains and planes will cancel on you just like that.\
  \ The key is adaptation. Traveling through India will show you who you really are,\
  \ how short your temper is, and how fast you can think on your feet. \nOur train\
  \ from Agra to Jaipur was terminated, and the employees at the train station had\
  \ no idea what to do. They were googling tickets and times just like we were. Luckily\
  \ for us, a group of friendly South Africans gave us the number of a reputable driver.\
  \ It would cost way more than the train, but in the end we decided it was worth\
  \ it to know we would actually reach our destination. \nWe were eating for our friends\
  \ inbound flight to meet up with her, but the flight was canceled. She was able\
  \ to find another one quickly, but we\u2019d have to wait an extra couple of hours.\
  \ Because of that we found this beautiful restaurant called Blue Spice where we\
  \ could relax, drink, and look out not the street. We made friends with the miniscule\
  \ servers and took pictures together, and had a good time, something that would\
  \ have no happened if the flight was on time. \nSometimes when things go wrong you\
  \ have to adjust your mindset to see how they went right. That\u2019s how you survive\
  \ traveling in India."
