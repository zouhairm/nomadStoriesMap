Text: "It is an amazing country,right? I mean your own country, your people. Exploring\
  \ those unknown areas. That happened to me last summer, when we decided, with my\
  \ best friend Marina, to visit Jujuy, a province of Argentina. \nOnce in my life,\
  \ two years ago, I had the incredible chance of visiting Australia, but nothing\
  \ compares to Jujuy. Wow! Spechleess. \nThe people. The community is really genuine.\
  \ One time we decided to walk alone to the\" Garganta del Diablo\"( devil's throat)\
  \ and we had a really long journey on foot. At one point, we got lost; we did not\
  \ know if the path we were taking was right. So, in the middle of the mountain,\
  \ under that heat, that sun, with nothing to drink or eat, we saw a small house.\
  \ It was so petit and beautiful. Inside there was this woman with her daughter.\
  \ They had some fruit and water. They sold empanadas, which is a typical food from\
  \ the province. They make it with goat cheese. After being offered something to\
  \ eat and drink, I had to ask them if they new where garganta del diablo was; to\
  \ this, the young girl, points with her fingers to one path, and says :\"por ahisito\"\
  . And my heart melt. That is an expression these people use; it would mean something\
  \ like :\"that way\" but in a really short way(diminutive manner). That is when\
  \ I realised that these people are extremely sweet and so incredibly humble. With\
  \ such a small word you coul tell the register they use when talking with people.\
  \ \nI also notice they do not look at your eyes when speaking. They normally look\
  \ down. When taking an excursion, we, as clients, had to ask them how much we had\
  \ to pay for the service; otherwise, they would not ask for it themselves.\nIt was\
  \ an extraordinay way of learning about their community. It gave me a deep feeling\
  \ of guilt and anger too, to know that they do not stand for themselves and do not\
  \ have a voice; they are really shy and as a consequence do not have character.\
  \ \nI reall wish that every time we travelled, could see the people in the area.\
  \ But really SEE them; see the way they live, their backgrounds. To truly understand\
  \ why they are the way they are; the history behind. \nYou leave the place with\
  \ a sense of a deeper love and understanding. You would not look that spot the same\
  \ way as a simple tourist does. You would feel like one of them; you would feel\
  \ humble, caring and kind. I believe that trying to be in their shoes, could change\
  \ the perspective of your trip completely. It would give you more than you could\
  \ ever imagine.\nI will never forget the way this community made me feel."
