Text: "It was always my dream to travel to Hawaii. And out of one of my deepest depressions\
  \ the birth of my dream became a reality. My mother could hear it in my voice I\
  \ was hopeless lost, didn\u2019t want to live anymore, and didn\u2019t know what\
  \ to do. She offered a trip to Hawaii, and before I knew it I was there. It was\
  \ almost magical, every day I went snorkeling with the fishes, took yoga classes\
  \ that were impossibly hard but left me with the best high I have ever felt. Went\
  \ on a horseback ride Through the jungle. Found secret waterfalls and forests. Went\
  \ on sacred grounds and prayed. This trip didn\u2019t just fufull my dream it healed\
  \ me deep within & transformed my soul. I have been to many oceans, but there was\
  \ something so magical about this place I cannot put into words. I also did not\
  \ know this would be the last trip I would take with my mother. She took her own\
  \ life a year later.  So wherever you are whoever you are don\u2019t just treasure\
  \ where you\u2019re at, Treasure who your with because life is short and unexpected.\
  \ You never know when your time is up. So take a leap of faith into the unknown\
  \ and do what you\u2019ve always dreamed of. There\u2019s so much magic just waiting\
  \ to be found."
