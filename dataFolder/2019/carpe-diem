Text: "Life is for the living. I have experienced this first hand since I left home\
  \ at 17 to explore the world. With two weeks I applied for my passport, visas and\
  \ organised my itinerary for the following weeks and months to come. It is so easy\
  \ to get overwhelmed by the day to day buzz of trying to maintain an acceptable\
  \ standard of living, without experiencing life itself. The world is there to explore\
  \ with so many cultures, places and experiences to indulge in. I have been so many\
  \ places and met a lot of fascinating people. People need to experience life through\
  \ the eyes of other people. Be empathetic and understand perspectives and opinions\
  \ relative where you are or visiting. Before I knew it, a decade had passed. What\
  \ I can remember from this time is nit things but experiences, places and people.\
  \ Technology is shrinking the world, however being \u2018connected\u2019  is another\
  \ debate; we are being transfixed to our devices without taking part. I recently\
  \ got my act together and saved, knowing I am going to pinpoint on an atlas and\
  \ travel there, not planning but experiencing what the location had to offer. Jamaica\
  \ is paradise for just that. Two weeks got me addicted. I have soome exquisite places\
  \ encompassing paradise. I have mental images that I carry with me. We explored\
  \ the country and met so many amazing individuals who have become friends. Life\
  \ is for sharing and the most sacred part is how we connect as humanity. My soul\
  \ was fully charged and have become enriched by what I have gone through. From idyllic\
  \ places and forests and mountains and waterfalls and soul warming culture and music\
  \ and biodiversity.... do I need to continue? Snorkling to cliff diving to scaling\
  \ a 300 ft waterfall overhung by foliage riddled with gigantic \U0001F577! The trip\
  \ was overwhelming and my body warm from the spirit, I received, both physically\
  \ and mentally! Jamaica houses some of the best rum in the world paired with reggae\
  \ and tropical fruits, the best way to start a day in the Carribean sun! One love\
  \ Jamaica \U0001F1EF\U0001F1F2 \U0001F31E"
