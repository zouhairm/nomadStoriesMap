Text: "A round face with crinkled eyes and hands that weren't soft. The air was sticky\
  \ with the oncoming monsoon season, neighbourhood cats lounged lazily on the terrace\
  \ and buses ran outside. The mosquito netted door banged softly as we sat on the\
  \ bed, my grandma, a stern woman, with a hard bed. My first visit to Nepal as a\
  \ teenager, the unforgettable humidity that hits you as soon as you land in Kathmandu,\
  \ the streets dusty and strewn with litter and spittle, and the country, the epitome\
  \ of the colour green and blue. \n\nThe buddhist temple Swayambhu -still my own\
  \ personal little mountain - sat 10 minutes away as my grandma spoke to me, a vague\
  \ memory of stories of my parents, stories of our childhood and smiling eyes getting\
  \ smaller. A hard woman with a hard life and quite possibly the most well-dressed\
  \ lady I know. My ghar ko mom. My grandma from my dads side. My maitha ko mom, my\
  \ grandma from my mums side, sat in Balaju Kathmandu. 80 years old, sitting on the\
  \ marble floor and smilingly passing banana chewing gum to her grandchildren. A\
  \ woman who used to sneak behind buildings to smoke with my grandpa since the age\
  \ of 14 and still smokes to this day.  A woman with a lined face, partially wrapped\
  \ hair and a gummy smile. \n\nMy aunt brings me dhuy sweetened with Indian sugar\
  \ while the adults drink tea with puffed rice. There are no birds in the sky as\
  \ the misty rain coloured the air yellow. \n\nMemories come of my great grandfather\
  \ sat on the terrace in the sun with a blanket lightly covering his lap. Snippets\
  \ of me and my sister sat at his feet as a blurred face gave us sugar rocks. Huge\
  \ misty coloured rocks that contained the sweetness of sugar canes and the unidentifiable\
  \ taste of something else. It wasn't the season for sugar canes yet, monsoon season\
  \ never is. Unripe greenish canes sold by vendors, the green skin meant to be pulled\
  \ by teeth and the yellow lined reed to be bitten and chewed to suck out the flavour.\
  \  Chewed reeds spat onto the street as more skin is pulled to reveal further sweetness.\n\
  \nStories told by the girl downstairs of the house on the mountain still alight\
  \ even as the country's power goes out, the sight of lamps being lit, the burning\
  \ smell of swirled incense mosquito repellent. Sitting on the roof, tending to chickens,\
  \ playing marbles, eating khulfi and trying to remember Nepal. \nI sit with my maitha\
  \ ko mom on the marble floor, me with my sweet dhuy, her with her cigarette, she\
  \ holds my hand and we sit."
