Text: "What should I tell about New York that has not been said before. Coming from\
  \ India I compare it with \u2018 Mumbai\u2019 a mid western city located in India\
  \ which is most commonly called \u201D Mayanagri\u201D in Hindi. So is New York\
  \ for me, city of dreams. With high significance of fast pace life and full spectrum\
  \ view of day to day life I would say New York is an oasis for people looking for\
  \ traveling, multi cultural experience and food.\n\nLooking at well dressed New\
  \ Yorkers and mass population seen at restaurants and bars, I believe someone has\
  \ carefully  curated the lifestyle of this city. However its just what it looks\
  \ like, glamorous, outreaching, diverse and empowering. I love New York for its\
  \ lifestyle, strength to sustain in the worst weather yet see summer coming and\
  \ most importantly I love it for what it offers. It offers opportunity to everyone\
  \ regardless of race, ethnicity and culture, it supplies a lot of power into you\
  \ by making you competent enough to fight the odds yet hope for the best and also\
  \ generates and develops emotions like love, agony, loneliness and acceptance.\n\
  \nMany people ask me, why New York? why did you choose NYC out of so many other\
  \ beautiful places in America? My answer to them is, I have not chosen New York,\
  \ it chose me which is very rare because New York welcomes only those who are ready\
  \ to give up everything that is easy and comfortable in order to fulfill their dreams\
  \ and explore. It is not the draft beer or pizza vendors or times square that attracts\
  \ tourists, It is the energy that exists in the air. It is an overwhelming experience\
  \ for foodies across the globe, since this city has all cuisines under one umbrella\
  \ called the big apple of America.Ranging from milkshakes of \u201D Black Tap\u201D\
  \ to Artichoke pizza, shaved ice cream and  chocolate deserts of \u201D Max Brenner\u201D\
  \ food is the new culture of this place. from small condos to rooftops and from\
  \ storage hubs to eating on the roads is a crucially required part of being a New\
  \ Yorker.\n\nI am not only inspired on daily basis but also drawn to experiment\
  \ with myself, my beliefs, strengths and weaknesses.I had to overcome my delusional\
  \ behavior and set a benchmark of progress in order to cope up. To sum up I would\
  \ say come to explore New York and you might end up exploring more than New York."
