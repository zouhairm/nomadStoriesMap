Text: "I fulfilled one of my fondest desires in life, to experience the vastness of\
  \ this planet.  I traveled to over 180 countries from late 2009 to early 2011. I\
  \ watched colors I had never imagined in the distant seas of New Caledonia, listened\
  \ to melodies played by folk musicians in Uzbekistan, smelled intense scents in\
  \ Ethiopian streets, tasted every single edible part of a cow in Argentina, felt\
  \ the cold air punish my skin in Iceland, and heard thousands of stories throughout\
  \ the continents. And I didn't expect to feel completely lost after traveling the\
  \ world. That last sentence seems like an off-putting way to begin a story like\
  \ this, right? But back in 2011, I felt I had failed even though I achieved things\
  \ I had only dreamed of. \n\nI wanted to share the experience with utter honesty\
  \ and without filters, but I couldn't do it. I was involved in a social media project\
  \ put together by a company which had a very specific way of understanding life\
  \ and its dynamics. The company provided a platform where I could share content\
  \ on a daily basis, but the editorial outlines were restricting. I'm not going to\
  \ pretend I didn't know the type of project I was embarking into. I wasn't working\
  \ for a newspaper or a magazine. I knew that even though I was carrying out journalistic\
  \ duties, writing articles, filming videos, and taking pictures, I was also engaging\
  \ in brand ambassador duties.\n\nSure, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.\
  \ If I were to travel back in time, I'd do it all over again. But now, as I type\
  \ this, I ponder upon the choices I made during that time. I learned, just like\
  \ many travelers before have and many more will, that traveling is discovering others\
  \ and oneself. The journey to the many paths that cross this complex, yet beautiful\
  \ planet, is one worth taking. I witnessed really luminous aspects of human nature,\
  \ but also deeply somber expressions of what we humans can and will do under dire\
  \ situations and I didn\u2019t get to share the experience as it happened.  \n\n\
  I felt I was losing my voice and style in the process of traveling through the entire\
  \ planet. I was sacrificing things about myself in order to visit distant lands\
  \ and experience things by first hand. I was lucky to hear a myriad of stories.\
  \ I learned so much about them but at the same time, also felt I was leaving behind\
  \ who I used to be. For a time, I felt lost because of that.  Now I know I wouldn't\
  \ change a single thing about it because I learned I want to tell stories as they\
  \ are.     \n\nThe dust has already settled and now, years after the odyssey ended,\
  \ I've come to the realization that I want to begin a new journey. I don't want\
  \ to set out on another adventure if that means holding back the words and stories\
  \ I can share with others. I believe words tend to find a way, especially if they're\
  \ true. They can shed light upon those places obscured by sorrow and ignorance.\
  \ Words should spark curiosity in readers, and I'd like mine to do that. A curiosity\
  \ which is willing to face fear even when there isn't a speck of certainty that\
  \ everything will go according to plan or how we want. \n\nI remember Cavafy's famous\
  \ verses: \n\n\"as you set out for Ithaka\nhope your road is a long one,  \nfull\
  \ of adventure, full of discovery.\" \n\nI recognize that discovering my words will\
  \ be a long journey on its own. Probably one that will take a lifetime, with no\
  \ guarantee of arriving at my destination. I want to travel to distant lands once\
  \ again to listen to all of the stories out there expecting to be told, and this\
  \ time tell them as they should.  Will I succeed in this endeavor? I don't know,\
  \ but I'm willing to embark into this trip, hoping to arrive in a new and different\
  \ port. I've already foundered before. This time around, I want to learn a different\
  \ way of doing things, and I need to be mentored along the way. \n\n\n\nAntonio\
  \ Carlos"
