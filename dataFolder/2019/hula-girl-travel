Text: "Day 1 - Nothing like a getaway after an eventful Christmas with the endless\
  \ barrage of Yuletide happenings. This was an hour and half from my mom\u2019s house\
  \ in Vienna, VA who joined us on this little weekender. The drive was completely\
  \ enjoyable, though the car a bit cramped with five people and two dogs in my sedan.\
  \ The ride was pleasant though, passing through the beautiful East Coast towns of\
  \ Lovettsville, Brunswick, & Frederick.\n\nThe Airbnb rental, the Gardenview, a\
  \ Craftsman style house on 1.35 acres nestled quietly behind old town Boonsboro\
  \ was magical. We loved everything about it. From the koi pond on the side of the\
  \ house with a statue of Buddha, the front porch and balcony, to every nook and\
  \ cranny of the house with antique furniture painted a coral blue and fashionably\
  \ distressed. It was made out of the stuff you dreamed of in your childhood.\n\n\
  We dined at Dan\u2019s Restaurant and Tap House. Unfortunately, we did not make\
  \ reservations. There was only a 35-minute wake but my diabetic mom had already\
  \ taken her insulin shot. Plan ahead kids and call restaurants before assuming.\
  \ As we waited, we walked about and took a look at the various gift shops and other\
  \ tourist spots.\n\nDay 2 - From our Boonsboro, MD stay we took a day trip back\
  \ to one of our favorite haunts, Harper\u2019s Ferry, WV. This time we left the\
  \ dogs behind so we could walk inside many of the niche local stores. As usual,\
  \ the town was busy and full of tourists who shared the same idea of visiting the\
  \ quaint town.\n\nThe train station, the tunnel through the mountain, the Shenandoah\
  \ River on the bank side are all historical markers with the town on the mountain\
  \ in the beautiful backdrop. Right after the Christmas holiday, the day was warm\
  \ and sweet. People walked on the streets with their puppies and families. We parked\
  \ by the train depot and took the steep stairs up to the main road across the street\
  \ from the parking area.\n\nHarper\u2019s Ferry is the perfect go-to destination\
  \ for holiday cheer. It reminds me of all those water towns in nostalgic films I\
  \ grew up watching like Mystic Pizza. Here are some photos from the day that we\
  \ took as we enjoyed the day.\n\nDay 3 - It was interesting to hear my mother\u2019\
  s story of how as a young woman she worked at Luau Hut. She had followed my biological\
  \ father to the states after university in Taiwan. My father attended the University\
  \ of Maryland at College Park. My mother worked as a cashier and listened to many\
  \ classic Hawaiian songs almost every day.\n\nAll of this was news to me. I formed\
  \ a dance company based mostly on the success of the the Polynesian Dance Arts.\
  \ My mother have never informed me about this segment in her life before. The subject\
  \ came up nonchalantly as we drove from Boonsboro to Hagerstown for some Indian\
  \ cuisine at the famed Mango Grill. For some reason, the thought occurred to me\
  \ to ask her if she ever lived in Maryland before. It so pleased me that during\
  \ the popularity of Hula in the \u201960\u2019s to \u201980\u2019s, my mother was\
  \ a part of that community. It must have been wonderful!"
