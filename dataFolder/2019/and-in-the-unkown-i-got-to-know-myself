Text: "The floor is shaking, my heart is beating, ready for take off! No idea what\
  \ will happen but eager to find it out. \nIn my first night I lost everything: First\
  \ my hope, but then also my fears, my expectations and somehow myself. I had no\
  \ clue what to do when I was standing there all on my own, no idea where to go.\
  \ What the hell am I doing here?\nAfter a confusing night in which I was looking\
  \ for something without being aware of what I wanted to find some locals turned\
  \ out to be my new companionship. Even if we didn\u2019t understand each other it\
  \ felt like we have never been with someone else. \nDusk. My first dusk in paradise.\
  \ Awakening next to our little campfire, with the mystique symphony of the nature\
  \ while squirrels and monkeys jumping through the branches over our heads. Walking\
  \ barefoot through the jungle and feeling the warm earth under my feet. Slowly the\
  \ sun began to rise. The jungle was dipped in beautiful colors and the sky looked\
  \ as if it is set on fire. This was the moment where I finally arrived on the magical\
  \ Island Sri Lanka, the tear of India. The sound of the birds, which sang my welcomehymne,\
  \ the screams of the peacocks and the breath of Mother Nature brought me to the\
  \ moment and gave me everything I needed. Still amazed by this paradisiacal theatre\
  \ I was convinced: Everything will be fine! And this gave me courage and hope because\
  \ if everything will be good in the end, then there is nothing we have to worry\
  \ about in the present. Everything will come to you as soon as you are ready to\
  \ receive, so just lean back and enjoy what\u2019s now!  With this new feeling of\
  \ encouragement I was following my new friends to a busy restaurant full of tourists,\
  \ they brought me to the backdoor and behind a little local outdoor kitchen was\
  \ waiting for us. Surrounded by giant palmtrees we were sitting on the floor and\
  \ eating with our hands while telling stories without speaking the same language\
  \ and they gave me confidence and safety by their eyes. \nThe best memories always\
  \ started when I had no idea how to go on. When I had nothing life offered me the\
  \ best opportunities. Everytime I left the path of comfort gained so much.\nAnd\
  \ so I found freedom within myself. I don\u2019t know if complete freedom is possible,\
  \ human beings may always be determined by so many factors but you can give yourself\
  \ the freedom to follow your intuition and then you will find the beauty of the\
  \ world, the magic of life.\nWhile travelling I didn\u2019t only see new places,\
  \ I also got to know all these different versions of myself. I am like a puzzle\
  \ and I found my bricks all around the globe. In the unknown I get to know myself.\
  \ I found my silence in the voice of nature. I found myself in everybody. I found\
  \ home in all these little moments of joy, I found home in all those trustful eyes,\
  \ I found home in my own heart. And the whole world is my family: All those beautiful\
  \ souls who inspired me, the ones who showed me where to look, the ones who gave\
  \ me hope and opened up their hearts for me, the ones with the glow in the eyes\
  \ even when the lights are out. \nIf you are tired maybe it is not because of a\
  \ lack of sleep - maybe you need to wake up and live. Destroy all your doubts and\
  \ fears, all those barriers that keep you away from what you really want. Do things\
  \ that set your soul on fire, meet people who bring out the best in you. Step out\
  \ of your old tracks, explore your wilderness, open up your heart and trust, then\
  \ life will give you everything you need. Go with the wind and he will show you\
  \ all the amazing places where he is blowing through. Dance in the rain and cherish\
  \ every moment because happiness comes from within. Don\u2019t wait for anyone or\
  \ anything. Your time is now!"
