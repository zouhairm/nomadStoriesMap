Text: "I was late getting to Beomeosa Temple and honestly a little embarrassed to\
  \ be so off-schedule, even though my solo-traveling self was the only one affected.\
  \ By the time I had walked far enough up Geumjeongsan Mountain for the front gates\
  \ to finally be in view \u2013 it felt wrong to let myself be carried to a temple,\
  \ and also I had low confidence in my foreigner's navigation of the Busan bus system\
  \ \u2013 the sky was already starting to shade to the pale orange-y gray of past-sunset.\n\
  \nDespite knowing that this temple remained open to the public later than most,\
  \ I quickened my pace, still hoping to actually see the place in the light of day.\
  \ Sure enough, as I passed through the first set of gates, it was clear that the\
  \ other tourists were heading in the opposite direction. They'd already taken advantage\
  \ of the daylight hours... but I realized that my being late also meant that I was\
  \ almost alone.\n\nAnd then it grew dark. And quiet.\n\nBeomeosa was lit sufficiently\
  \ to allow you to still see many of the compound's beautiful features, and you certainly\
  \ weren't at risk of being lost in the night. But those lights only drew attention\
  \ to the depth of the surrounding darkness on the forested mountain, where no technology\
  \ or human residence polluted the view. Also absent were the sounds that accompany\
  \ those things, and whereas the small lights only made the darkness feel greater,\
  \ the surrounding silence amplified the temple's small sounds. I was overcome by\
  \ hearing: tiny bells on the corner of the tiled roofs, strings of stiff paper lanterns\
  \ fluttering in the wind, the step of my own shoes across the stone walkway.\n\n\
  The quiet darkness on the mountain contrasted sharply with that sunny afternoon\
  \ months ago in Fort Tryon Park where, with the sounds of shouting and laughter\
  \ and dogs and not-so-distant traffic jostling around me, I'd sat on a green wooden\
  \ bench and muscled back tears that threatened me with the idea that I cared as\
  \ my mother told me the names of my birth parents. I'd been adopted from South Korea\
  \ but never made a return trip until now, when an offer to work on an opera in Tokyo\
  \ provided me with the opportunity to make a side journey of my own. With barely\
  \ a half-year to prepare, I knew that the chances of my being able to find any birth\
  \ family were low. Still, I felt the need to prove myself to someone in the pettiest\
  \ of ways, like the strangest thirty-second year high school reunion, showing everyone\
  \ that I'd only gotten hotter, smarter, and more successful since I'd left. Or not\
  \ since I'd left, since even in my most self-deprecating moments, I think that I\
  \ could beat most three-month-old babies on those counts. Instead, I was competing\
  \ against who I might have been \u2013 if. \n\nA thunderous drumming erupted nearby.\
  \ \n\nLater that night, sitting in a dumpling shop back at the bottom of the mountain,\
  \ I would search for information about Buddhist drumming on my phone. It turned\
  \ out that what I had witnessed was a ritual for the purpose of liberating all sentient\
  \ beings in the universe, with four percussion instruments being used for the beings\
  \ on earth (beomjong, the temple bell), in the water (mokeo, a wooden fish), in\
  \ the sky (unpan, the cloud gong), and in heaven and hell (beopgo, the dharma drum).\
  \ That four-instrument samul ensemble is actually considered as the possible origin\
  \ for the traditional samul-nori music that I'd grown up watching in Korean culture\
  \ camp and other events meant to connect me to my roots.\n\nIn that moment in the\
  \ dark on the mountain, however, knowing the reason why was the last thing on my\
  \ mind. I stood there alone, late but on time in ways that I never could have planned.\
  \ I'm no Buddhist master, though, and that presence of mind couldn't last forever.\
  \ Eventually, I grew self-conscious about over-staying my welcome and walked myself\
  \ back down to the waiting area by the temple entrance.\n\nI hopped on a bus to\
  \ return myself to the rest of the world, a little bit freer."
