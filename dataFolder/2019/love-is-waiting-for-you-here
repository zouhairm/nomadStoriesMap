Text: "I was a poor lonely Mexican girl lost in Toronto, with nothing left but full\
  \ of hope. Everyone told me it was difficult, it was impossible, that I was too\
  \ young, that I am a woman, that I wasn\u2019t that strong... but I was there looking\
  \ for, I don\u2019t know what but looking for something. The first week I didn\u2019\
  t have a place to live, no friend in that giant city, not even one soul to trust.\
  \ The time kept running, and every day I was more poor, the city was becoming too\
  \ cold, but how Could I give up? I needed to try one more time, but I was tired,\
  \ a lot of people took advantage of me there, my roommate stole my money, my boss\
  \ tried to fuck me, literally fuck me. I got sick in bed, my boyfriend cheated on\
  \ me and I got herpes, I got lice. People think that this is not supposed to happen\
  \ in Canad\xE1, but it does my friends. But I don\u2019t need 700 hundred words\
  \ to describe my journey, it was funny because after all, I was the happiest girl\
  \ on earth. It\u2019s priceless to see a group of kids playing between each other,\
  \ they don\u2019t know how to judge if his friend is Chinese, portugu\xE9s, Italian,\
  \ black, yellow or ilegal. It\u2019s priceless to se a dog playing with a squirrel\
  \ in the snow, it is priceless to walk on those streets knowing that no drug dealer\
  \ is going to rape you. And there is no gold on earth that can compared with that\
  \ sky, oh Lord! That sky that make you feel alive, that sky that make you smile\
  \ like an idiot, and that second of happiness, when you see the moon through the\
  \ buildings, it\u2019s when you fall in love with life, and make you fall in love\
  \ yourself for being that brave, for being that strong for never stop believing\
  \ that you deserve the life you always dream."
