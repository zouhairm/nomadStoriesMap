Text: "I got some extra money that I didn\u2019t expected, from a trial I never even\
  \ thought that I could win. So I bought a ticket to travel alone for 10 days. The\
  \ day 9 one, with a new friend made in the road I went to a local club to dance\
  \ local music. In the middle of the night i found someone that looks like anything\
  \ I ever seen before and, at the same time familiar. I dear to ask him to dance.\
  \ The connection is immediate. We dance for 5 hour non stop. The night is coming\
  \ to an end, so our story.\nWe live 12000km away from eachother... we decide to\
  \ kiss goodbye.\nHe walk me to the hotel and i got the felling that i will dance\
  \ with him again.\n6 months later we start to text. In my country is day in his\
  \ is night, in my is winter, in his is summer. In mine I can\u2019t stop thinking\
  \ on him, in his apparently is the same story. \nI got an invitation to a festival\
  \ in a country that is exactly in the middle of our countries.  \nHe says \u201C\
  I meet you wherever I want\u201D\nWe decide to spend a week together in Spain.\n\
  If it doesn\u2019t work we are saved. But, sadly, we are perfect for each other.\
  \ The last day I explain how hard It Can be for me, with an Argentinian salary to\
  \ afford this kind of relationship.\nHe answers \u201CI know that is risky, I want\
  \ to tale that risk\u201D\nHe visited me twice in Argentina, I work  12 hours a\
  \ day for 6 months and make enough to visit him in Sweden.\nIt\u2019s been 2 year\
  \ of love in the distance. I spend months not even touching him and I never felt\
  \ so loved and cared in my life.\nHe is my couple, and the love of my life, I wanna\
  \ ask him to marry me. Portugal would be the perfect escenario."
