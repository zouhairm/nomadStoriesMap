Text: "I arrived in Poland in the fall of 2015, all the city was covered in autumnal\
  \ colors. The streets were embraced by the naturalness that was transcending from\
  \ the trees to the buildings made of stone. I suddenly understood that I was going\
  \ to live in a place where nature is in balance with the city. \n\nI am not a romantic\
  \ person myself, but I discovered that living in such a coquet city can turn on\
  \ the romantic vibe. However, beyond anything else, Wroclaw, the city that I called\
  \ my home for a year, opened my eyes. Beyond its streets marked by the war and the\
  \ scars of the obsolescence of the communism a magical place reveals itself.  \n\
  \nTruth to be told, just a few people from outside Poland actually know that Wroclaw\
  \ exists. It is a small city, where life turns out to be a little different than\
  \ what I knew. Stories about dwarfs, mysterious figures in the night and secret\
  \ churches within a church are hidden in this small city where I began my new life.\
  \ \n\nSince my first day, I was encouraged by my teachers to wander around and be\
  \ aware of the beauty of the city. Maybe that is why, without noticing it, I made\
  \ a habit of going out in the afternoon to the island of the churches to surprise\
  \ the mysterious guy who still ignites the street lights one by one. The city has\
  \ two islands within the center, and one of them has all the street illumination\
  \ as it was since the oldest times, with gas. It feels like time never moved on\
  \ since the interwar and the feeling grew stronger inside me when I found out that\
  \ one person lights the fire every evening. Many people strived to see the mystical\
  \ figure and some never succeeded even after a couple of months. For me, its presence\
  \ felt closer to Santa Claus than to a real person. \n\nWhile waiting to discover\
  \ the mysterious worker I noticed so many times the lockers on the bridge that leads\
  \ to the island. I never quite understood why people declare their love by locking\
  \ up something. Love should be represented by something that grows freely, not by\
  \ something that gets stuck, so the padlock on the bridge was never a symbol of\
  \ appreciation to me. Maybe that is why I always smiled when seeing the authorities\
  \ cleaning them to leave more space for the unforgettable love of other couples.\
  \ \n\nHowever, love travels around the city, no matter what. Wroclaw is called the\
  \ little Venice of the North, along with four other cities in Poland. Not a memorable\
  \ sobriquet, but truth to be told, the city has its life strung to the sides of\
  \ the river. Many romantic dates were proclaimed on the promenade of Odra, many\
  \ adventures started canoeing against the current, many stories were told on one\
  \ of the 130 bridges while watching the birds flying high over the city. Along its\
  \ way, the Odra river touches the wilderness of its forests, the gray suburbs marked\
  \ by the industries, the vibrant island of the youngsters and the godliness of the\
  \ island of the churches.\n\nWhen I moved to Wroclaw I knew almost nothing about\
  \ the city, so it came as a surprise to discover that every street has its hidden\
  \ dwarf. Hidden is an unfortunate word because they are in plain sight, but they\
  \ are integrated so well within the city that many times I passed by without even\
  \ noticing them. Those little statues spread along the city through the years becoming\
  \ its symbol. Their story began not as a branding tool, but as a symbol of a movement\
  \ against the communism, however, nowadays they serve as a marketing symbol for\
  \ any company willing to pay for creating one.\n \nThere are so many places to see,\
  \ so many streets to discover, but at the end of the day, I understood what makes\
  \ Wroclaw a place I crave to live in. It is the connection between the past and\
  \ the present, the joy to live and the strong desire to overcome whatever impediment."
