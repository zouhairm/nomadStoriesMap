Text: "\u201CI GOT US TICKETS TO PARIS JESS!!!!!\u201D was the message I received\
  \ at 4:23 on a Thursday afternoon in March from Karissa, one of my best mates I\u2019\
  ve made along the years. We had flight tickets to one of the most renowned countries\
  \ on the planet and we were both ecstatic and smiling from cheek to cheek. After\
  \ months and months of planning and Skype sessions, the time had finally come. We\
  \ had planned on couch surfing our way through France but didn\u2019t really make\
  \ too big of a deal of finding a house to stay at because we were sure luck was\
  \ on our side. We landed in Paris; excited, anxious, and lost as to where to go\
  \ from the airport. All we knew is that we were grumpy, exhausted, and that 18 hour\
  \ flight was not a good look for the two of us. So with our bags strapped across\
  \ our shoulders and our head in a daze we start walking until we come across something\
  \ with enough nutrients to keep us going! We eventually stumbled across this pizza\
  \ shop that smelled like freedom and luxury baked into the shape of a pie. Our waiter,\
  \ Theo was a charming 20 something who had a cigarette hanging out of his mouth\
  \ when he took our order and nodded to every local he saw on walk in. \u201CDude,\
  \ I\u2019m going to ask him if we can stay at his place until we know where we\u2019\
  re going\u201D my friend Karissa exclaimed. \u201COh okay yeah great idea, two young\
  \ women in an unknown country staying with a stranger. Great idea.\u201D I responded,\
  \ not really that invested in the conversation because of how loud my stomach was\
  \ grumbling. My friend and I somehow ended up having a pretty long conversation\
  \ that ended his shift until we found ourselves roaming the streets of Paris together.\
  \ He asked us if we had a place to stay and we looked at eachother and laughed at\
  \ our inablitity to properly plan. Theo then invites us to stay a few nights at\
  \ his apartment with his lovely girlfriend who would eventually wake us up in the\
  \ morning with fresh jam and bread. Every morning whilst staying with the lovely\
  \ couple they would take time out of their day to show us around the cool areas\
  \ of Paris and we would end the day by falling asleep in parks nearby. It was an\
  \ unlikely meeting that turned into a beautiful friendship that shall last forever."
