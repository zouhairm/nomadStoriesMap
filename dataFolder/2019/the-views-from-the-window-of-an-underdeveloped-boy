Text: "Coming from an underdeveloped country, doing an international trip is a luxury\
  \ of the few. At 16, I had the opportunity to leave the country for the first time,\
  \ going to England to study English. In the school I was, there were students from\
  \ 16 countries, each with its culture, its people, its jokes, its songs and all\
  \ with that desire to always tell a little of its history, so that the foreigners\
  \ feel a little native also.\n\nSince the airplane landed in Birmingham, my eyes\
  \ were glazed on every window I could see. Upon entering the transfer that would\
  \ take me to the campus, I took my cell phone and started an endless video showing\
  \ every detail of the English streets. It was all so new, so organized, so dreamy\
  \ ...\n\nWhen I arrived at the school, I spent 15 days listening to foreigners talking\
  \ about Ayrton Senna, Felipe Massa, Neymar, Daniel Alves and Michel Tel\xF3. To\
  \ sing \"Mas Que Nada\" and to know that it is a Brazilian song. Trying to learn\
  \ foreign languages \u200B\u200Bjust by approaching new friends. My Brazilian boy's\
  \ eyes sparkled, it did not seem real to be in such a new, beautiful and historical\
  \ environment.\n\nI was able to visit 4 English cities, Ludlow, London, Birmingham\
  \ and Liverpool. As a music lover, I could not miss the Cavern Club, the first place\
  \ the Beatles played. The timing was special. Every song that played at the museum\
  \ reminded me of childhood moments. The first song I learned to play on the piano\
  \ was Hey Jude, which, although only from Paul MCcartney, was played several times.\n\
  \nIn Birmingham I had contact with an immense library. I had never entered a library\
  \ other than the small book room of my school. There were titles in several languages,\
  \ and the architecture of the place drew attention to its differentiation.\n\nIn\
  \ London, I burst into tears at the sight of Big Ben. When I was 11, I watched the\
  \ London Olympics glaze on television, trying to understand every historical reference\
  \ of the opening and closing ceremonies, singing together the songs of the English\
  \ classics, admiring the beauty of a country so striking in world history.\n\nAlready\
  \ in Ludlow, I had contact with a quiet country town. Its architecture and organization\
  \ attracted attention. The population there was quite simple, ethical, and organized.\
  \ The city's clean air filtered my lungs meditationally. There I watched my first\
  \ film entirely in English, and realized simple values \u200B\u200Bof the interior\
  \ life that I never had access to.\n\nI was also surprised by the climatic differences.\
  \ I still do not understand how English summer is so cold. Accustomed to 40 degrees\
  \ in the summer, temperatures as 9 degrees were freezing.\n\nUnderstanding these\
  \ important changes in different societies makes us hope for better days in our\
  \ home country. I could not return to Brazil without keeping with me the desire\
  \ for change and activity to improve the living conditions of the population. I\
  \ was told that international travel was \"rich people's business\", however, the\
  \ only thing that reverberates in my mind is the wealth of knowledge that comes\
  \ into them, and how much they instigate the individual to growth."
