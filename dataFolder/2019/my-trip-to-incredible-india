Text: "I arrived in India in the first week of October 2015. It felt like a leap into\
  \ the unknown more so with the different culture I would be experiencing for three\
  \ weeks. Mark you India is notable for her cultural diversity.\nI landed in India\
  \ via the Mumbai Airport which was quite big compared to Uganda\u2019s Entebbe Airport\
  \ where my journey had begun. The dress code at the airport was a mixture of Indian\
  \ and Western style.\nMy impression about the country was changing given all that\
  \ I had known about India such as the religious and cultural diversity, as well\
  \ as historic significance in Asia. My orientation to life in India was quite enriching.\
  \ It was in such a way that my stay in India would not in any way be complicated.\n\
  As with all the countries I have been to, I was looking forward to a personal view\
  \ of India which would require domestic travel within India. \n\nMy journey to India\
  \ was not without challenges, as it took me some days to recover my baggage that\
  \ had gotten misplaced due to a rescheduled flight plan. Given the residence location\
  \ I was at in Gual Pahari, Gurgaon, New Dehli, I had to adjust to being in India,\
  \ without personal effects and close confidants to turn to in such a dilemma. I\
  \ had to remember so many of the things I learnt from my time as a boy scout, among\
  \ them the motto: Be Prepared.\nMore to that, remembering that no man is an island,\
  \ I had to get in contact with the people I met at my place of residence as to forge\
  \ networks that would prove useful during my stay in India. I appreciated that the\
  \ dynamics were different for me in India than in my homeland, Uganda \u2014 I had\
  \ to make life easy for myself in a foreign land. \nAs alluded to, my first few\
  \ days in India were quite challenging, but I slowly adjusted to the new life experience\
  \ while looking forward to travelling to the different iconic places of India. I\
  \ looked forward to taking in as much as I could while travelling, and also posting\
  \ my experiences on my Facebook page. \n\nI started off my tour experience with\
  \ a visit to Dilli Haat, which is a permanent paid-entrance open-air food plaza\
  \ and craft bazaar located in South Delhi, run by Delhi Tourism and Transportation\
  \ Development Corporation. I was made to understand the rich Indian cultural heritage\
  \ and trade linkages.\nAs well, I visited Mukteshwar Uttrakhand which is on the\
  \ Himalayan mountain range. It took proper acclimatization to avoid altitude sickness.\
  \ Among the precautions taken was to drive slowly on the winding roads. This leg\
  \ of my India tour enabled me appreciate the community-climate interactions. I got\
  \ an opportunity to visit sites with models of sustainable technologies implemented\
  \ in different villages. The experience of the Himalayas ended with a return journey\
  \ to Delhi using the Indian Railways operated train.\nMy next memorable moment happened\
  \ when I arrived at the world famous Taj Mahal in Agra. While there, I kept reminiscing\
  \ how anxious I felt at the start about my leap into the unknown. I remember gazing\
  \ towards the Yamuna River and realizing there was a lot to see about India from\
  \ my remaining days there.\nWith four days left in India, on October 19, 2015, I\
  \ paid a visit to the Toilet museum. I had not foreseen such a tourist attraction,\
  \ and could barely imagine what it looked like. But there I was, at an initiative\
  \ of India\u2019s leading NGO (Sulabh International Social Service Organisation)\
  \ that fulfils Mahatma Gandhi\u2019s unfinished task to restore human rights and\
  \ dignity to the \u2018untouchables\u2019 while providing affordable sanitary facilities\
  \ to masses throughout India.\n\nAfter 3 weeks of networking and touring in India,\
  \ I headed back home to Uganda to get ready for a trip to the Rainbow Nation."
