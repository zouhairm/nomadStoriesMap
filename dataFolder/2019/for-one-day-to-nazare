Text: "The dream called \u201CWaves in Nazar\xE9\u201D was presented to me by a guy\
  \ from Tinder. It was a standard meeting, when after 10 seconds I want to leave.\
  \ But as the plan of escape was not ready, I had to act according to the principle\
  \ \u201Cfind something good in the current situation\u201D. The good thing about\
  \ this meeting was definitely: it gave me a dream! \nAfter 3 years, the dream began\
  \ to acquire real features. February 1, 2019, leaving the car on a hill, we headed\
  \ towards the lighthouse. At once it became clear that rubber boots and a raincoat\
  \ precisely wouldn't prevent. Slowly moving in the direction of the fort, I passed\
  \ the weighing (it turned out that a couple of extra kilograms are simply necessary\
  \ not to be carried away by the wind), my hair was styled with a 5000W hairdryer,\
  \ then under the test was the maximum level of noise that I am able to publish in\
  \ a state of delight, excitement, curiosity, fear and even horror. For some reason,\
  \ a specialist in neurology did not meet us at the entrance to the fort. His office\
  \ was at the top, right next to the lighthouse, where there is only a low concrete\
  \ fence between you and the ocean.\nThe hardest thing was to force myself to get\
  \ out of the fortification. Climbing up the stairs leading to the observation deck,\
  \ a wild, unbridled wind energy struck in the face, rushing the waves of the ocean.\
  \ Not giving the right to inhale and exhale, it stunned, abducted the volume of\
  \ the spoken exclamation interjections, rustling down the jacket. Wind asymmetrically\
  \ played with cheeks, burying all hopes for a beautiful photo for instagram.\nJudging\
  \ by the fact that I crawled to the edge of the fort, the neurologist assessed the\
  \ state of mind as adequate, noted the love to life and a moderate degree of adventurism.\
  \ Ahead was the boundless Atlantic... It was possible to observe how the wind flow,\
  \ gaining demonic strength, circled and waltzed the surface of the ocean. It was\
  \ thrown out on the cape suddenly so that it continued to circle in confusion over\
  \ the lighthouse, as if collecting the applause of the hall.\nI looked where the\
  \ bottom of the canyon rises abruptly near the coast, where they are born - giant\
  \ waves, YouTube stars. One by one, they rolled and shot up the sea of splashes.\
  \ The most purposeful drops flew to the open parts of the body. And then, in the\
  \ first row of the stalls, looking at the vast expanse of the ocean, I wished my\
  \ children would come here one day.\nAs soon as we had time to get used to the wind,\
  \ the sky above Nazar\xE9 filled with clouds, which in an instant began to shed\
  \ their \u201Cyeast\u201D tears into the ocean. By establishing a symbiotic relationship,\
  \ the ocean began to foam. White fluffy lambs rolled out from its depths to the\
  \ coastline. The ocean slept restlessly, constantly tossing and turning under the\
  \ unquenchable force of rain and wind. In just a couple of seconds, the slanting\
  \ rain turned me into a cold biscuit soaked in salty syrup on one side.\nIn order\
  \ to digest a little bit of emotions and dry up, we moved to the cafe on the first\
  \ line. The life cycle began to repeat again and again: the bright sun was replaced\
  \ by the shower with a cloudy watery veil, the black dots - the figures of people,\
  \ were on duty at the lighthouse, then disappeared into the safe walls of the fort.\
  \ I did not want to return from the warm room to the lighthouse, especially since\
  \ the ocean was raging 50 meters away from us, rolling foamy waves all the way to\
  \ the cafe.\nIn the evening we returned to Lisbon, and the next day we were already\
  \ at home. All the way back, I inhaled the smell of hair, even winding them around\
  \ my nose. Thousands of Atlantic particles turned out to be easy-going travelers.\
  \ They easily suffered a trip and stayed overnight. This night I dreamed giant \
  \ waves in Nazar\xE9 again and I inspired salty breath of the ocean\u2026"
