Text: "I was tired. I had visited Prambanan, Borobudur, Ratu Boko, Mount Merapi and\
  \ Mangunan in just three days.  Walking up and down the stone stairs of the temples\
  \ at UNESCO World Heritage Sites and ancient ruins of what was once a palace had\
  \ started hurting my knees. The jeep ride to Merapi volcano that erupted few years\
  \ ago had humbled my body and mind. The pretty photobooths at Mangunan forests were\
  \ gram worthy. The vast green spaces were refreshing. The open minded and warm hearted\
  \ conversations with strangers were uplifting.  I could go home after that. But\
  \ I didn\u2019t.\n\nI had booked my flight tickets and hotel for Bali. The original\
  \ plan was to spend three days at a resort in Ubud and two days at a beach hotel\
  \ in Kuta. But I didn\u2019t feel like changing hotels unpacking and packing my\
  \ stuff all over again. I wanted to stay in one place. I needed rest.\n\nI am glad\
  \ that I felt so. A volcanic Tsunami suddenly struck shores between Sumatra and\
  \ Java islands. Alerts were issued to avoid going to any of the beaches on other\
  \ islands as well. Ubud being in the centre of Bali was safer. I spent next two\
  \ days having a laid back time exploring the swimming pool, spa and restaurant at\
  \ the resort. \n\nBut soon boredom crept in. I wanted to learn Bahasa Indonesia.\
  \ But there weren\u2019t any short workshops available. I had seen the Monkey forest.\
  \ I didn\u2019t have the energy to learn Balinese dance due to fatigue. I had already\
  \ done Yoga classes, Reiki, Charka Journey and Art of Living in India. \n\nPondok\
  \ Pekak Library and Learning Centre, I discovered accidentally while looking for\
  \ places to eat. They had classes on wood carving, playing a musical instrument,\
  \ kite making and other such activities of cultural significance. \n\nI reached\
  \ there in the afternoon. I was hungry. A wood carving class had just finished.\
  \ Nothing was scheduled for next few hours. But the kind souls took pity on me and\
  \ arranged a music class which would start in half an hour. I immediately registered\
  \ for it. To my delight, my registration fee included lunch and a drink. Over the\
  \ next 15 minutes my lunch was ready. Soon thereafter my teacher arrived. \n\nParman\
  \ was the name of my teacher. He was a kind, gentle looking, patient man with a\
  \ pleasant demeanor. He showed me the area where musical instruments are kept. On\
  \ the elevated platform rested a few red and golden pieces of wooden bed tray like\
  \ structures, flanked by red umbrellas with long handles fixed on the ground and\
  \ red drapes hung from the ceiling in the background. It looked like a place of\
  \ worship. I thought it was a temple.\n\nWe sat in front of instruments called Rindik.\
  \ It\u2019s a bamboo xylophone from which music is created by striking its tubes\
  \ with a mallet. I held one mallet in left hand and one in right. He began to teach\
  \ me a melody from the composition Gilak Dung. Its a composition that strengthens\
  \ and protects. I struck one tube twice with left hand and two different tubes simultaneously\
  \ with the right hand. This was repeated for next set of tubes. Once I got a hang\
  \ of the pattern I got the music playing. I had heard Gamelan at Sultan Palace in\
  \ Yogyakarta. It was an orchestra of traditional instruments that played music during\
  \ religious occasions and important ceremonies. The music was deeply resonating\
  \ and brought me to a stand still.  But playing one of those instruments would be\
  \ this tough, I realized later.   \n\nParman asked \u201CWhere are you from in India?\
  \ I have been to Delhi and Raipur\u201D. Did he say Raipur? Was he there on 1st\
  \ Nov? He said he was! He had gone for a performance. I told him \u201CI am from\
  \ Raipur!\u201D He was amazed.  He had gone for the foundation day celebration of\
  \ the State of Chhattisgarh of which Raipur is the capital.\n\nWe continued to strike\
  \ mallets on Rindik to create music. Meanwhile the sound of Rindik continued to\
  \ strike conversations that created connections. The connections that feed the soul\
  \ of universe, the way music feeds a human soul."
