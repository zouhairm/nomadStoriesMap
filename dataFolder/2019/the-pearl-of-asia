Text: "I arrived in Cambodia knowing next to nothing about the culture, the history\
  \ or the people. I had just spent forty-eight hours in Hong Kong, retracing my steps\
  \ to the Hospital where I\u2019d been born nearly twenty-five years ago. It was\
  \ now time to move on and have another adventure. I arrived in the dead of night\
  \ at my hotel in Siem Reap, Sala Lodges. The open plan welcome lobby and restaurant\
  \ were dimly lit and the only light on the pathway to my room was the concierge\
  \ torch. Every hotel room at Sala Lodges is modelled on a traditional style of house\
  \ from Cambodia, making every visitor\u2019s experience unique and special. \n\n\
  The following morning I awoke early, keen to start reading my guidebook. I made\
  \ myself a refreshing cup of tea but as I opened the shutters of my window, I noticed\
  \ a figure with a straw hat dart out of sight. I wondered who could have been sitting\
  \ below my window at this time of day. I sat on the terrace, tea in one hand, guidebook\
  \ in the other and turned to the vocabulary page at the back of the book to get\
  \ to grips with some basic Khmer (pronounced \u201Ck\u2019my\u201D - the local dialect\
  \ in Cambodia) phrases. Below are some of the phrases I attempted to use during\
  \ my stay.\n\nHello\u2026 Soo-a s\u2019day\nGood morning\u2026 A-roon soo-a s\u2019\
  day\nHow are you?\u2026 Nee\u2019ak sok sa bai gee-ar dtey? (Try and say that quickly\u2026\
  )\nPlease\u2026 Som\nThank you\u2026 Or-koon\nYes (spoken by male/female)\u2026\
  \ Baht/jahs\nNo\u2026 Dtay\nMy name is\u2026 K\u2019nyom chmoor\u2026\n\nAt breakfast,\
  \ the Juice of the Day was called a Royal Dragon. In Cambodia, there is a tradition\
  \ to associate a colour with each day of the week and a god to protect that day.\
  \ Hindu mythology is at the root of this tradition and each day influences the colours\
  \ that are worn in traditional dress such as at weddings and other special occasions.\
  \ Sala Lodges followed this tradition with a daily Healthy Juice and a cocktail\
  \ which corresponded with the colours of this tradition. Today\u2019s colour was\
  \ dark purple. I was told that the Royal Dragon prevented coughs and asthma and\
  \ supported liver detox function.\n\nA while later, I met my tour guide who took\
  \ me on a hike to Kabul Spean, a waterfall which cascaded over stone engravings.\
  \ It is believed that once it has flowed over the engravings, the water is considered\
  \ holy. It was a sweaty hike up to the waterfall but the climb was exciting. I spoke\
  \ to my tour guide who told me about his upbringing during the Khmer Rouge era and\
  \ how he and his friends would play with landmines\u2026 As you can well imagine,\
  \ this left me speechless. \n\nOnce we reached the top, I paused to take in this\
  \ spectacular sight. The cracks in the stone reminded me of the Stone Table from\
  \ The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe by C.S Lewis. Yet the water seemed to wash\
  \ over the carvings in slow motion. I had a hand towel on me, soaked with sweat;\
  \ I felt this could be the perfect opportunity to cool off. With my tour guide\u2019\
  s permission, I approached the waterfall, rinsed out my hand towel and wiped my\
  \ forehead with the holy water. \n\nThe following day, I explored Siem Reap on my\
  \ own. As I walked along the bridge to the entrance of the temple Preah Khan, I\
  \ noticed a woman on the side of the road selling some kind of artwork. I asked\
  \ her what they were and she told me her bas-relief rubbings on rice paper. There\
  \ was one in particular that caught my eye. This painting showed men on elephants,\
  \ women carrying baskets and people wheeling their carts to and from the market.\
  \ \n\nThe painting hangs above my piano at home. It reminds me of the children who\
  \ grew up in a war zone, the women who work in the markets earning money for their\
  \ families and the gardeners who work long days, maintaining the beautiful grounds\
  \ of the hotel and who occasionally seek shelter in the shade below my bedroom shutters."
