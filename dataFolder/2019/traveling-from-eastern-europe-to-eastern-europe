Text: "Our world became small, like yesterday. The day before yesterday, traveling\
  \ was not something common or easy, and then - BOOM - give or take a few hundred\
  \ years, and you can travel several thousand kilometers with the snap of your finger.\
  \ Easier than planning the shopping list of groceries or figuring out small talk\
  \ topics with your mother-in-law. Traveling within the European Union became something\
  \ domestic, like visiting your grandparents in the countryside. \"Real travel\"\
  \ begins when you switch at least one continent. Really? Think again. Even sticking\
  \ to one region can turn your world around, if you have time and the focus to be\
  \ present. ***\nMy plane landed in Riga on the 1st of September, like a lame back\
  \ to school promotion. Warm wind hit my face after I have left the airport building,\
  \ that kind of weather which stretches from the Sommer to Autumn, that unimaginable\
  \ 'one month' somewhere around August and September that I can not live without.\
  \ But in the Baltics? Sure, thanks a lot climate change, I owe you for that, get\
  \ back to me as soon as you can! After jumping in a van which was labeled public\
  \ transport, we were bound to the city central to my Airbnb flat. I did not know\
  \ back then that after some adventures I will be spending 5 more weeks there. The\
  \ radio was on and a Rolling Stones tune was playing, it almost felt like a private\
  \ taxi, something cosy, familiar, welcoming. Welcome to Riga, my friend, pleased\
  \ to meet you. I can see in your eyes that you have a sympathy for the devil. ***\
  \ \nAnother 10 hours straight in the kitchen. After a while, you get to know all\
  \ the small details. It is like you are high on LSD (or at least that is what I\
  \ am told), you can smell the colors and hear the sounds of the smell, which is\
  \ ventilated from the ground floor 24/7 pizza delivery to your 5th floor flat. I\
  \ have never worked as a remote freelancer before so it was a quite nice learning-by-doing\
  \ hands-on experience. Whenever I had enough, or my head was too full to think clearly,\
  \ I just stormed out of the flat to the central station to catch a train to Jurmala.\
  \ I could not resist the call of the sea anyway. It may sound as a clich\xE9, but\
  \ wait until you live in a country without a sea. I am a truly lucky guy. I have\
  \ walked along the beaches of South Beach Miami and Venice Beach L.A, but I have\
  \ never experienced something so 'zen', filled with peace and harmony lasting forever,\
  \ that I have had there, on the sandy beach of Jurmala, Latvia. Even as the cold\
  \ arctic winds started to knock on the door in October, I still could not resist\
  \ to pay a farewell visit to the shores of the Baltic before leaving this unknown\
  \ and beautiful country, that is much more than meets the eye. I guess you will\
  \ never know, until you travel from Eastern Europe to Eastern Europe."
