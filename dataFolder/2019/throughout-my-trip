Text: "Little by little the trips became a passion ... But from the first time I knew\
  \ how to write chronicles ... The trips started with the school, to know my beautiful\
  \ Argentina during 56 days ... And soon my university studies concluded with the\
  \ reading from a book where I travel in the time, seeking to touch each site to\
  \ the nomadic evolution Inca... Today, ten years after that trip I have known Argentina,\
  \ Bolivia, Peru, Brazil, Italy, Spain, France, Portugal, Tenerife, Indonesia, Kuala\
  \ Lumpur, and many airports ... Writing and recounting each place ...\nIn each place\
  \ I decided to know the seas, its waves and surfing as a common thread ...\nI will\
  \ stop here to tell you that \"worldnomads\" has told me again << YEAH!!, Portugal\
  \ >> and there I will come back this year to continue exploring this beautiful country\
  \ of the sea, to tell every details of those places that are not known, to give\
  \ them life and prominence in many stories of new travelers.\nMy time in Portugal...\
  \ \nA great destination for surfing, knowing cultural traditions, and so many legacies\
  \ from the times of wars and political persecutions, that we should not miss to\
  \ understand its history.\nWith a little more than 800 km of coastline, it offers\
  \ the most beautiful sunsets, the best view of the Atlantic Ocean and the largest\
  \ & biggest wave in the world.\nThroughout my trip I was able to enjoy the most\
  \ tasty gastronomy of the sea. With its cod cakes and the freshest seafood.\nIf\
  \ we enter the continent we will find a culture so old and so entrenched that today,\
  \ it takes us to enjoy those little streets full of colors; or those tram rides\
  \ that teleport us to a past so exciting that it leaves us open-mouthed and, if\
  \ you love photography how like me, you'll have to have a good set of batteries,\
  \ because the best angles to portray and immortalize your trips are here!!.\nOn\
  \ my arrival at the airport, a rental car waited for me, and in 12 days I managed\
  \ to travel from Lisbon to Nazar\xE9, passing through Ericeira and Peniche to enjoy\
  \ the best waves, mounted on my surfboard; We traveled to a renowned surf tournament\
  \ with more German backpackers that were in the hostel; and I traveled all over\
  \ the interior of Portugal on my return to Lisbon.\nOnce in Lisbon I returned the\
  \ car and in 6 hours was missing to take my flight, I ventured to discover, walking,\
  \ all the historic center using also the public transport that offered me to get\
  \ from the airport to the most beautiful tourist sites, in a Circular route that\
  \ returns to the airport in just 1 hour and 15 minutes.\nI could go down and up\
  \ to the next buses stops how many times I needed it, but when I started to walk\
  \ its streets, I chose to walk, since at the airport I had left all my luggage in\
  \ a locker.\nI recommend Portugal and there I will return to tell each landscape,\
  \ each flavor and tell you about the warmth of the local hosts.\nBrunel Doubre"
