Text: "I didn\u2019t have a plan, or a mission. I simply wanted something new. I booked\
  \ a ticket to Spain in hopes of finding more to life in a humid summer afternoon\
  \ sitting in my aunts\u2019 bland concrete covered backyard.  Barely having a friend\
  \ left around, I had constant communication with my cousin who lives in Salamanca,\
  \ Spain. Not only my urge to see this country continued to built on strong but it\
  \ also became now an option to move there.  \n\nI had no idea what I was expecting.\
  \ I didn\u2019t Google the city of Salamanca or Spain or seen any films that inspired\
  \ me to go, I just knew that I wanted to go far away and this was the right destination.\
  \ When I finally landed, my cousins who traveled three hours to Madrid to pick me\
  \ up at the much-deserted airport were waiting for me. A giant red bus ready to\
  \ take us to Salamanca awaits for us. Surreal. I didn\u2019t even know what I was\
  \ going into but I wasn\u2019t nervous or processing anything, matter of fact, till\
  \ this day I still haven\u2019t processed it yet. \n\nSerene ruminations of cream-colored\
  \ buildings built hundreds of years ago pulled me under their spells in the streets\
  \ of Salamanca. Around 4pm a man with black shades and a fedora tunes me out of\
  \ reality as his fingers effortlessly play the notes in Asturias by Isaac Albeniz.\
  \ The intense Spanish heat waves swing in the air in harmony with the compelling\
  \ notes. I can feel summer dancing amongst the streets. Making my way to him, I\
  \ feel my body getting lighter. I place one euro in the inside of his wine red velvet\
  \ guitar cover and he kindly thanks me with a rich magnetizing smile. \n\nThe whole\
  \ time I was in Spain I felt na\xEFve. I was seeing new things, hearing new words,\
  \ learning about traditions, all which fed what I longed for, newness. My stay in\
  \ Salamanca lasted for about a month. I visited Madrid, Santander and two other\
  \ small towns with nothing in mind but to simply be. Though everything seemed vague,\
  \ I grew certain that I belonged to discoveries. Launching myself to go to Spain\
  \ seemed so simple to me and natural almost like I have done it before except I\
  \ didn\u2019t. All of my excitement was there but because I was so in tuned with\
  \ the happiness and freedom I was gaining out of it, my emotions rested at peace.\
  \ \n\nStreets are uneven and the sun is coming down; giving the city a touch of\
  \ some sort of Mediterranean exotic mystique. In my eyes this is another world.\
  \ Picture perfect viewed from an angle at the end of the Roman bridge, you can see\
  \ the main cathedral of Salamanca aligning with the other great ancient architecture,\
  \ giving it a cinematic shot of a place that holds enchanting memories. Provocative\
  \ and indulging to the point to where you wonder what it would be like to be the\
  \ city itself. I imagined even the possibility of becoming the city on a next life,\
  \ as if let\u2019s say you could have your soul and existence reincarnated into\
  \ a city. I suddenly thought to myself amidst the summer wind, \u201Cto have my\
  \ soul live and feed of the magic of the streets?\u201D now that\u2019s something\
  \ I would love. \n\nEntering my last days in the city, I have gotten used to the\
  \ life there. I enjoyed the quiet almost solitary streets at 3pm, the set time for\
  \ a \u201Csiesta\u201D meaning nap, for native Spaniards. I found myself taking\
  \ naps during this time a few times too, even. I knew where the tidy small grocery\
  \ stores were, bus stops, how to get around the center of the city and so on. Moments\
  \ like finding a winsome old records and books shop, to sitting in the middle of\
  \ the plaza, to seeing two young lovers go for a swim at a tiny lake amid an empty\
  \ vegetative park became small memories and observations that live close to me when\
  \ reminiscing about my encounter with this once unknown city. They live so close,\
  \ they almost become a dream I dreamt of in my sleep."
