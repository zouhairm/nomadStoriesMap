Text: "From Paris with love\n\nYou know how you get those typical French phrases\u2026\
  ..?\n\u201CParis is always a good idea\u201D OR\n\u201CWe\u2019ll always have Paris\u201D\
  \ \u2026\u2026\nOh wait ...the best\u2026.\u201DJe Taime Paris\u201D....\nI Je Taime\
  \ you Paris???\n\nWe let me tell you my side of this love-hate affair of a story\u2026\
  \u2026.. \n\nSo my bestie, Tarryn and I, were on our last 2 days of our European\
  \ whirlwind adventure as we arrived in PAreeeee\nThe city of baguettes, love, glorious\
  \ food & french kisses!\nWe couldn\u2019t wait to roam the streets to experience\
  \ all the classical dishes I was trained on as a chef.\n\nFrom macaroons, croissants,\
  \ artisan breads, cheeses, you name it, we tried it all!\nExcept for Foie gras &\
  \ Cabaret.\nThat afternoon I got my foie gras fix on warm brioche for lunch.\nIt\
  \ lived up to all my dreams\u2026.smooth, rich, creamy & delicate!\n\nWe thought\
  \ to pre-book our shuttle at the hotel to get to the airport at 7am the next morning.\
  \ As we got to our room, the construction work next door was so hectic, that I went\
  \ into a coughing attack from all the dust. The receptionist couldn\u2019t offer\
  \ another and so we decided to check out & find a hotel up the road.\n\nFor dinner,\
  \ we found this quaint little restaurant, Le Petit Chatelet...straight out of a\
  \ movie scene.\nWe had wine, duck pie and a lobster salad\u2026..It was delish!\n\
  To top the evening off, we decided to go to an underground Cabaret show. \nWhat\
  \ an experience\u2026.they danced on tables right in front of us and it was just\
  \ amazing to experience.\nWe managed to get back to the hotel and set our alarms\
  \ first thing as we had to be at the airport at 6am and we still had to walk down\
  \ the road to catch the shuttle at the other hotel as we pre-arranged.\n\nLittle\
  \ did we know what the next 24hrs withheld from us\u2026\u2026\nThe next moment\
  \ when I opened my eyes & looked at the time, it was 6:30am!\n\u201CTarryn!!!!\u201D\
  \ I screamed!!! \u201CWE **^&$&&&%% missed our flight!\u201D\nI realised Tarryn\
  \ wasn\u2019t responding much as she was kind of looking green and making slow movements.\
  \  She had been throwing up during the night and was in and out of the bathroom.\n\
  I realised quickly she wasn\u2019t even able to function so I arranged for a doctor\
  \ to come to the hotel room. Once again, like a movie I tell you!!!\nAs the doctor\
  \ injected her in the buttocks to stop the vomiting, I realised I wasn\u2019t too\
  \ stable myself. I literally ran and dove into the bathroom.\nThe doctor diagnosed\
  \ us with food poisoning!\nFood Poisoning\u2026.but we are in PAreeeee! How can\
  \ that beee? We realised that we shared everything and it was either the foie gras\
  \ of my dreams or the lobster salad\u2026.who knows?\n\nThe doctor gave us tablets\
  \ & we slept for a few hours until we felt human again.\n\nAs we arrived at the\
  \ KLM helpdesk at the airport, we explained the situation. \nThe lady informed us\
  \ that the only seats available are on business class & costs $3000 per person.\
  \ \n$3000???? Tarryn and I looked at each other all teary. \nOur travel insurance\
  \ doesn\u2019t even cover half of that & I have have like $1500 left on my credit\
  \ card. The lady then told us that the only next available flight in our price range\
  \ is in a week\u2019s time as it was peak season but it departs from Amsterdam.\n\
  \nAmsterdam? But we are in Paris!\nWe realised we had to think about our options\
  \ very quickly and make a decision.\nIn the process of this shock and horror, I\
  \ started vomiting so badly, that I ended up on a drip in the airport\u2019s emergency\
  \ room. \n\nWe decided to email our bosses, ask for another week\u2019s leave and\
  \ flew to Amsterdam that night where we spent the week with one of Tarryn\u2019\
  s good friends, Caitlyn. We ended up having some of  our most amazing times in Amsterdam!!!!\n\
  \nWhat can I say\u2026.one story for the old age home one day while we gracefully\
  \ sip our wines out of our tea cups.\nYes for sure\u2026.how does the phrase go?????\
  \ \u201D WE will always have Paris!!!\u201D"
