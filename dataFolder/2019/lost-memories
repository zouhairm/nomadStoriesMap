Text: "\u201CStables\u201D read the sign above the entrance. My friends and I crossed\
  \ the street and walked in the yard of cobblestones. Besides the three of us, there\
  \ were only few people strolling around. We didn\u2019t expect to find the largest\
  \ market in London so lonesome: with its over 1000 places to shop and eat, Camden\
  \ Market is known to be always crowded. \u201CCyberdog is closed. Awkward!\u201D\
  \ said Valeria returning from a massive door with two giant robots in shining armour\
  \ on the sides. \u201CYou\u2019re too early, ladies\u201D told us a man in a yellow\
  \ jacket, who was sweeping the floor behind us. \u201CMany shops don\u2019t open\
  \ until 11\u201D. It was nearly 10 o\u2019 clock.\nMy mates and I had to take pictures\
  \ of contrasts for a photography course and we were suggested to visit Camden because\
  \ of the variety of the merchandise, from creative handmade crafts and vintage retail\
  \ to modern objects and music instruments. \u201CSince we\u2019re already here,\
  \ why don\u2019t we wander around until the opening?\u201D suggested Alessandra.\
  \ As soon as we reached a narrow passage through brick buildings, both Alessandra\
  \ and Valeria stopped and started shooting photos. I lingered for a while but couldn\u2019\
  t find any inspiration, so I decided to go on, alone.\nFollowing the street of cobblestones\
  \ leading to the entrance of a low tunnel, I imagined the horses clopping to the\
  \ stables at the time when Camden area was an important industrial site. I thought\
  \ I got lost meandering through the tunnel when I noticed something curious almost\
  \ blended in with the brown brick wall. It was a small circular cast-iron stove,\
  \ with a tortoise rounded by the motto \u201Cslow but sure combustion\u201D on the\
  \ top. Judging by the patina surrounding the surface, it must have been manufactured\
  \ more than 100 years ago, maybe more. How many lads had their hands warmed over\
  \ the stove? How many winters had passed by since the stove had been last ignited?\
  \ In less than an hour, tourists would have swarmed the tunnel and it would have\
  \ been nearly impossible to spot the Portway tortoise stove. How many people are\
  \ aware of the history behind Camden Market\u2019s stalls?\nAbsorbed in these thoughts\
  \ I reached a larger space packed with shops and stalls. I found myself back into\
  \ the 90s among elaborated furs, bizarre coats, denim shirts, colourful pullovers.\
  \ Looking at a shocking purple and red sweater, it occurred to me that somewhere\
  \ in my parents\u2019 loft there must have been such a piece of clothing. While\
  \ I was giggling to myself, something bumped into my back. I turned around: a thin\
  \ woman holding a chair and wearing a large trucker jacket, just like the sort of\
  \ garment hanging in the stall aside, was waiting to pass. \u201COh, sorry\u201D\
  \ I said, stepping back and giving her some space. I watched her walking up to a\
  \ high stall wrapped in dustsheets. She put the chair down, stepped on it and started\
  \ to uncover the stand. Displayed on the shelves, there were many old cameras in\
  \ line, different types of lenses and a lot of rolls (rolls! It had been a long\
  \ time since I last saw one). The stall looked like a photography gallery in miniature\
  \ and in my opinion, it was a pity to sell some rare items such as the antique cameras.\
  \ The more the woman exposed, the more I got impressed.\nI glimpsed a cartoon suitcase\
  \ laid open in a corner, with a card reading \u201Ceach 50p\u201D. What could have\
  \ been sold for few pence in a business like that? I moved closer to the bag: it\
  \ was filled with dozens of small and large, black-and-white, photographs. The inside\
  \ of a church, a woman holding a baby on the beach, a smiling family posing\u2026\
  \ I was rummaging through the photos when someone called my name. \u201CSerena!\
  \ There you are\u201D. Alessandra and Valeria wanted me to go with them; they said\
  \ I couldn\u2019t miss the horse bronze statues and the shops in saddle row. \u201C\
  Let me take a picture first!\u201D. I had finally found the contrast I was looking\
  \ for, where I least expected to find it: a stack of lost memories crammed in a\
  \ second-hand suitcase."
