Text: "In the little town where my husband is from, just a dot on the map on the Ligurian\
  \ coast, there are 400 total year-round inhabitants. \n\nLike countless other Ligurian\
  \ towns, this little town is a summer town, and once summer comes to an end, it\
  \ goes into hibernation. The restaurants and cafes close, shutters are drawn as\
  \ the Milanesi head home, and beach umbrellas are stored until the following year.\
  \ The only people left are the residents and travelers passing through on their\
  \ way to bigger places, north to Portofino or Genoa, or perhaps down to the Cinque\
  \ Terre.\n\nItaly is aging. This means that the residents in these little towns\
  \ are usually older. Younger Italians migrate to bigger towns and cities and even\
  \ further afield to study and to look for work. The Italian government is constantly\
  \ coming up with new ways to attract and retain its youth, but it\u2019s proven\
  \ to be an uphill, and sometimes awkward, battle.\n\nFor most of these older residents,\
  \ however, they\u2019ve been in these little towns for a long time and they\u2019\
  re not going anywhere. They know each other, speak the regional dialect, know the\
  \ rules of their local card games. They are already home.\n\nAt some point on any\
  \ given day, sitting on the green benches just off the main piazza of this little\
  \ town, you can find the usual suspects on either one side of the street or the\
  \ other. The chosen side depends on the sun. And the chosen topic of conversation\
  \ depends on the season. \n\nOne of the most important times of year is mushroom\
  \ hunting season. This takes place beginning in late summer and continues through\
  \ late fall, with peak season depending on the weather- the amount of rain, the\
  \ cold and the heat, the humidity, the winds. \n\nLiguria is a narrow region tucked\
  \ between the sea and the mountains and it is up into the mountains that everyone\
  \ treks to hunt for mushrooms, leaving pre-dawn and aiming to be back before 1pm.\
  \ That\u2019s lunchtime. Clothes covered in mud, leaves, and the occasional tick\
  \ or two are expected. The hunters bring back their mushrooms, compare their loot,\
  \ and share their stories. Hunting locations are shared only after the hunt, of\
  \ course. And these are often falsified.\n\nMy husband doesn\u2019t live in his\
  \ little town anymore, but his parents do. He, like many other Italians, has left\
  \ to find work, and now we live a few hours away. \n\nBut he still loves to go mushroom\
  \ hunting with his dad. He can tell by sight which mushrooms are edible and which\
  \ ones are not.He speaks the regional dialect, genovese, which he learned from his\
  \ nonna. And he\u2019s taught me how to play cirulla, the local card game, which\
  \ his dad taught him. \n\nHis mom, like me, is an immigrant to Italy. She is from\
  \ Holland, but has learned to speak fluent Italian without ever having taken a language\
  \ course, can make a genuine pesto alla genovese, and can give you an accurate prediction\
  \ of the weather based on the direction of the wind and the type of waves out at\
  \ sea. \n\nEventually, I know we will go back to live near his little town; to be\
  \ closer to his family and to his friends. And in this sense, not only is he like\
  \ many other Italians who have moved away from home, but he is like countless others\
  \ around the globe. There is always a pull to go back home. To end up back near\
  \ the people you love. To get some good home-cookin\u2019. \n\nOne day my husband\
  \ and I will be part of the aging Italian population. He will be one of the locals\
  \ sitting on one of the green benches, sharing his mushroom hunting stories. I will\
  \ learn how to speak Genoese, how to make a decent pesto, and how to interpret the\
  \ winds and the waves. Hopefully.\n\nAnd maybe one day we will start a family here\
  \ and we will teach these things to them. And about how it is possible to make a\
  \ new home in an old place."
