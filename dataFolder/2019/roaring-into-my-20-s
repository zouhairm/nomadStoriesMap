Text: "I was 19 and learning how to say, \"can I please have a chocolate croissant?\"\
  \ in French. This was how I was going to survive in Paris during my study abroad\
  \ trip in the summer of 2013. I had grown up admiring artists such as Van Gogh and\
  \ Claude Monet, so I knew my heart belonged in the city of art. I invested all my\
  \ savings into this study abroad trip and was finally going to see Paris! When I\
  \ first landed at the Charles de Gaulle Airport, I was in immediate awe of a specular\
  \ city with their fast public train transportation system. As a born and bred Los\
  \ Angeles gal, I was very excited to finally have a fast public transportation system\
  \ to rely on. I had an apartment about a 15-minute walk away from the Luxembourg\
  \ Gardens which was also close to my academy. The trip was filled with chocolate\
  \ croissants for breakfast, art history classes in the morning and visits to different\
  \ museums in the afternoons. The streets of Paris were elegant and there was beauty\
  \ in every corner of the city. From the Arc De Triomphe, the farmers market trips,\
  \ getting lost on the train and my stops for Nutella crepes along the way-it was\
  \ all a dream. The Orangerie Museum of Claude Monet\u2019s paintings were the most\
  \ incredible canvases of art I had ever laid my eyes on. It was love at first brush\
  \ stroke! Finally seeing Monet\u2019s famous Water Lilies painting was like a whimsical\
  \ journey of bright colors. Every day I was exposed to new adventures that have\
  \ lasted me a lifetime of memories. However, one night was very different from the\
  \ rest of my trip. One Tuesday night my friend Alex knocked on my door at 9 pm with\
  \ a bottle of champagne. I looked at him in confusion and all he said was, \u201C\
  midnight in Paris, come!\u201D.  If you have ever watched the film Midnight in Paris\
  \ by Woody Allen, you would know the famous steps in front of the Saint \xC9tienne-du-Mont\
  \ Church that faces the Panth\xE9on. Owen Wilson plays the main role and sits in\
  \ front of the church at midnight to find a 1920\u2019s entrance gateway. My friends\
  \ and I joked around about the thought of an entrance gateway into the 1920\u2019\
  s, but wanted to relive in the moment! So there I was at 9 pm, walking down the\
  \ streets of Paris with eight of my friends. That night was filled with magic. As\
  \ we made our way to the steps, our laughter and excitement only increased. For\
  \ hours, we talked about our life stories that led us to this point in time and\
  \ how it would have been like to be friends with Zelda and Scott Fitzgerald. We\
  \ counted down as the clock was striking midnight, like we were waiting for a new\
  \ year to ring in. When the clock struck midnight, we popped the champagne and that\
  \ was the moment I knew I was ready to roar into my 20\u2019s with new adventures,\
  \ inspiration and passion."
