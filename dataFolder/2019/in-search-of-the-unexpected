Text: "After so many years we were all reunited in family and we decided going to\
  \ the beach like any other family on vacations. We were only two hours of there\
  \ so it was easy to say \"tomorrow we are going to the beach\". Until there everything\
  \ normal. So, we prepared the car and went out for a beach day. But what a surprise\
  \ The beaches are full and we can not go to the islands near beacuase of the wheather.\
  \ We continue to another twon where we could find a beach but we found something\
  \ even better.\nA local told us that was the last beach available to swim but in\
  \ that town that is not the main attraction. Not everybody hear daily about a swamp,\
  \ or at least I did't have hear a lot about it. The local offered us a tour in canoe\
  \ through the swamp. After this moment all about the trip start to take a new meaning.\n\
  Being in that canoe seeing the perfect of the nature, seeing how the ecosystem is\
  \ self-sustaining and every piece of it is put in the perfect place is inexplicable.\
  \ But in the same time hear about how the human have been destroying it, and the\
  \ effort of the local population fight against everything for save their treasure\
  \ in the middle of nature.\nEntering the swamp is impressive. the flora around surreded\
  \ us and the fauna in perfect harmony. Slowly at just in fron of us start to appear\
  \ a house. Yes, a house in the middle of the swamp, in the middle of the water,\
  \ in the middle of nothing more than nature. But before we arrived ther we have\
  \ a on more adventure. Get to a dock and get off the canoe to see even more closely\
  \ the flora of that place. \nWhen you get to the houseboat, you can see the insignificance\
  \ of that house becuase all the protagonism is taken for the swamp.\nAfter that\
  \ is time to return to the town, leave the perfection of the nature behind and realize\
  \ that was an incredible unexpected trip that you would never change."
