Text: "When you are riding the BR 381, witch destiny to the state of Minas Gerais,\
  \ in Brazil, around the MG 458 (if you know about roads), there is a small entrance\
  \ to another road called Renato Nascimento. If you pass trought it right now, it\
  \ seems like a road like any other, but I remember the very first time I rood there\
  \ with my father, and nothing about it was like any other road. \n\nThat road leds\
  \ you to a small town called Lambari \u2013 in portuguese, is a fish name, probably\
  \ related do the big lake where the town builts around -, and is where my father\
  \ and all his sibbilings was born and raised \u2019till they aged enough to come\
  \ to S\xE3o Paulo with their parents and built a life here. \n\nI remember being\
  \ so exited about getting to know that place, I remember how all my father\u2019\
  s and uncle\u2019s stories had me thrilled to that trip, and I remember having the\
  \ time of my life going on my first road trip ever. But then, there was that road,\
  \ and I don\u2019t want to discourage you from visiting the place, that is exactly\
  \ the oposite of what I want, but I must warn you: that road is infinite, ever ending,\
  \ boundless. \n\nIf you google about how long a road trip from S\xE3o Paulo to Lambari\
  \ takes, it will tell you it takes around 4 hours, but I promise, we spent a lifetime\
  \ on that road. \n\nGladly, as a imaginative child, the long road was not a problem\
  \ to me \u2013 and not even to my father that was the happiest man in the world\
  \ on coming back to his homeland-, and I could appreciate the beauty around the\
  \ no-longer-mud road that surrounded me. \n\nWhen you live in a city like S\xE3\
  o Paulo, where buildings and skyscrapers are all over the place and the sky is blue\
  \ but not as blue as he could be, everything that shows itself a little greener\
  \ looks like paradise. And that was that road: timber fences surrounding the wide\
  \ farms fields we were passing trought, cows looking at us trought the car windows,\
  \ a thousand shades of green on the hills above and the wind shaking the leaves\
  \ like they\u2019re on a trip of their own. \n\nTo most of the people, the moment\
  \ of arriving the destiny is the most expected, and believe me, when we arrived\
  \ in Lambari, I was completely amazed by the small place that carries so much history\
  \ and hides the most beautiful waterfalls and the most vivid people, but honestly,\
  \ there\u2019s nothing like the ride. \n\nI come back to Lambari every year to see\
  \ my father\u2019s family and I\u2019m completely in love with that place and the\
  \ stories every citizen has to tell, but also every year I capture everything I\
  \ can with my curious eyes about the road and the wonder it has to show me. Every\
  \ year, there is more to discover from a long road that, for those who are willing\
  \ to see, has brand new eye catching experiences to offer."
