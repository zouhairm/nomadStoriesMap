Text: "As the plane swooped over Marrakesh I wrote in my journal that the ground was\
  \ a patchwork of neatly segmented dusty reds and browns, the turbulence sending\
  \ my pen skidding across the page. My time in Morocco was just as turbulent as my\
  \ landing.  I\u2019d buy kilos of sugar-snap peas from shrivelled old women who\
  \ patted my hands, their turquoise rings clamping loose skin to swollen bones. I\
  \ left trails of pea-shells through the medinas as buzzing tourist touts forced\
  \ chained monkeys onto my shoulders and, squeezing my bum, demanded an outrageous\
  \ price. A street vendor with a daughter my age sat and drank cup after cup of sweet\
  \ mint tea with me. When I returned to my hostel a man followed me and we had a\
  \ tug of war over the hostel door. The chaos of Marrakesh and Fez exhausted me,\
  \ and I asked the hostel owner where I should go to catch my breath. \u201CMoulay\
  \ Idriss,\u201D he said around his cigarette. \u201CYou should go there.\u201D He\
  \ spilt ash over my map as he stabbed his cigarette at me. \u201CMy cousin owns\
  \ a guesthouse there. I\u2019ll let him know you\u2019re coming, he\u2019ll give\
  \ you a good deal.\u201D\n\nMoulay Idriss is one of Morocco\u2019s most important\
  \ pilgrimage sites. Nearby lie the ruins of Volubilis, an ancient Roman and Berber\
  \ town. A glinting amber necklace had already pushed me over my budget, so I decided\
  \ to walk to the ruins along a rocky country road which seemed to snake in the right\
  \ direction. For half an hour I was completely alone among the olive trees. The\
  \ stillness was broken by two young men on pushbikes who called out to me in English,\
  \ then in French, and then in a jumbled combination of the two. When I mentioned\
  \ Volubilis they patted their handlebars triumphantly, offering me a ride. An awkward\
  \ scramble later my bum was taking a beating as we jolted down the rocky road, the\
  \ Moroccans laughing and pointing things out and shouting explanations in turbulent\
  \ Fren-glish. I kept my arms firmly through the straps of my backpack.\n\nAt the\
  \ entrance gate the Moroccans stopped to argue with the guard over the ten-dinar\
  \ entrance fee. I paid mine and was swept away from them in the flood of flashing\
  \ cameras disgorged by a tourist bus. As I passed a bath house my eyes brushed a\
  \ guard sitting on a low wall. When I smiled and said \u201CSalam,\u201D he jumped\
  \ down, shook the hand I offered, and demonstrated how the Romans would have sat\
  \ in the baths. \u201CYalla, yalla!\u201D and he led me deeper into the town, plucking\
  \ purple wild flowers as he went. By the time we reached the agora he\u2019d twisted\
  \ them into a wreath which he plonked triumphantly on my head. He yelled \u201C\
  naughty, naughty!\u201D at a chubby American boy climbing a wall, then he helped\
  \ me scramble onto a broken column and posed me for a photo, crouching to get the\
  \ angles right. He held down the rope which protected the most famous mosaics so\
  \ that I could walk over the ancient tiles. He showed me a stone slab topped with\
  \ a carved penis, and gleefully insisted I straddle it for a photo. As we clambered\
  \ over walls he\u2019d take my hand to help me, and his smile developed a slight\
  \ edge which made me want to take a step back and cross my arms over my chest. I\
  \ mentioned my husband waiting for me at the visitor\u2019s centre, and with a brief\
  \ hug farewell I left him standing beside a shattered column, squinting into the\
  \ sun.\n\nAs I headed towards the road home the Moroccans wheeled their bikes towards\
  \ me. \u201CFrankie! Frankie!\u201D they called, waving me over. Pulling me in close,\
  \ they opened their backpack and we all peered inside. Quivering next to a glowing\
  \ orange was a baby rabbit. Its wet nose wrinkled with terror when they placed it\
  \ in my hands. Kneeling in the dust, we released it and watched it dart back towards\
  \ the ancient town. We added each other on Facebook when we got back to Moulay Idriss.\
  \ They still send me declarations of love from time to time."
