Text: "I was taking my young daughter for a walk in the pram on Saturday in the suburbs.\
  \ It was not a particular Saturday at a particular time, more so hundreds of Saturdays\
  \ rolled into one. Every week, we strolled past endless starched white residential\
  \ properties, with their harsh lines, like a poor Picasso replica. This all to familiar\
  \ orchestrated mass of cement accompanied by the same families, getting their Saturday\
  \ lattes, was becoming a terrifying Groundhog Day. Each corner that I turned showcased\
  \ the same mundane, predictable \u2018modern simple\u2019 designs and lives. Even\
  \ the symmetry of the trees that lined the roads left little to the imagination,\
  \ there was no wilderness, no surprise. \nEach Saturday, I tried to connect with\
  \ my local world, embrace my privilege without success. At such a time, one embarks\
  \ on a holiday. But where does one go as a single female traveller when they wish\
  \ to truly connect? Well, for starters, I was adamant to avoid the Eat, Pray, Love\
  \ clich\xE9. Any clich\xE9 really. It was my mother who thus suggested Turkey; she\
  \ was convinced that it was the \u2018safer alternative\u2019 to Egypt and of course\
  \ the birth place of Civilisation itself. I was convinced.  \nThe long-haul flight\
  \ was predictably tedious and finally I arrived at my destination. I selected Trabzon\
  \ to start my journey, a small town that lies on the north eastern coast of the\
  \ country on the Black Sea. One is tempted by the delights of the Western coast;\
  \ of course, the majestic dome of Hagia Sophia with walls lined with marble sourced\
  \ from numerous quarries across the Middle East and the romance of Justinian I and\
  \ Theodora which inspired such an offering to the heavens never fails to impress.\
  \ Or the splendour discovered further down the eastern coast of the ruins of Ephesus,\
  \ one of the Ancient wonders of the world where all that remains is one single pillar,\
  \ which even somebody with a thick soul would find ever so poignant. \n Instead,\
  \ however, I was drawn the eastern delights of the country. Trabzon, a medieval\
  \ multicultural town due to its old place on the Silk Road, is curiously devoid\
  \ of Western travellers. Perfect. I spent the morning strolling the city centre,\
  \ stopping every so often for a Turkish tea (or cay as one calls it, the first Turkish\
  \ word I learnt) and a cigarette (because everybody smokes in Turkey, or so the\
  \ locals tells me). Everything seemed to slow. I\u2019m unsure if it was the fascination\
  \ of the unknown, or simply the joy in pure anonymity. \nThe hotel steered me in\
  \ the direction of the Sumela Monastery. I eagerly accepted a tour to the site,\
  \ especially noting that the tour would not be in English. I was happy to allow\
  \ the space to speak for itself, Turkey is like that. One doesn\u2019t need all\
  \ the information spoon fed through headphones and an audio guide. In fact, the\
  \ experience does not call for it at all. The drive up to the monastery is purely\
  \ magnificent; the landscape of the Altindere National Park changes with every turn\
  \ and is ever undulating. It\u2019s hard to know where one is sitting in respect\
  \ to sea level as we traversed and descended constantly. \nAnd so, we finally arrived\
  \ at the Sumela Monastery, gloriously nested on an isolated cliff face, a construction\
  \ that boggles any engineer. One can \u2018google it\u2019 and still find it awe\
  \ inspiring, but in the flesh it is almost mystical in it\u2019s beauty. It took\
  \ little effort to imagine the stories of the Greek monks who first inhabited it;\
  \ I wonder if they ever experienced the flatness of suburbia that we all feel in\
  \ \u2018modern life\u2019. As I explored the old Rock Church, chapel and domestic\
  \ buildings, I was so deeply moved by the lives these people would have lived. Not\
  \ an easy one by any means, but perhaps a more inspired one. A more connected one.\n\
  Turkey is spectacular. It mended a splinter in my heart that I did not even know\
  \ existed."
