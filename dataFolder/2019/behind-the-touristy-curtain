Text: "The grass at the Ayers Rock Camping Ground was scant and yellowish, dead. Planted\
  \ close to the sacred rock Uluru, and part of the Ayers Rock Resort, our camp had\
  \ strong showers, and rustic wooden tables in an open-air kitchen featuring a row\
  \ of fridges. The price wasn\u2019t bad either.\n \nMy boyfriend and I set up our\
  \ tent in time for a quick shower before hitting the main square of the resort.\
  \ The Aboriginal dance was scheduled at five; I didn\u2019t want to miss a thing.\
  \ We were finally standing on land where the Dreamtime, the Aboriginal understanding\
  \ of the Sacred World, came to existence some 40,000 years ago. \n\nThe Resort Town\
  \ Centre wasn\u2019t hard to find, its asphalt bursting with people in and out of\
  \ the shops. Some cued at the ATMs and others looked obsessed at the Tour & Information\
  \ Centre. There, we learned about changes in the schedule; the ritual dance was\
  \ postponed for Tuesday as a part of the New Year\u2019s celebration. We walked\
  \ back, past an art gallery and the astronomy club, all very touristy looking.\n\
  \  \nIn the distance, from the arid landscape, a cry from a wedge-tailed eagle filled\
  \ the air.\n \nWe were almost at our car when near-by chatter caught my attention.\
  \ The smoky voice and the strong burst of palatal consonants belonged to a man with\
  \ a scraggy greyish beard. He wore a red cloth wrapped around his waist. The chalk-white\
  \ lines on his arms looked animated as he spoke to two elderly women sitting in\
  \ the shade of a leafy tree.\n \nThe women had canvases spread in front, and while\
  \ they clenched their paintbrushes, neither paid much attention to the man. He felt\
  \ my stare and when his eyes found mine; he grinned. Next, he was inviting us over.\n\
  \n We approached, and the two women gave us a quick once over. They wore sullen\
  \ pouts and loose clothes with bright colours that contrasted their skin and matched\
  \ the dotted pattern on paintings.\n \nThe man offered us their art; his price was\
  \ a bargain. We quickly agreed, and I enquired about the Dreamtime symbols on the\
  \ paintings. \n\u2018Give me a beer?\u2019 the man interrupted, and mumbled something\
  \ about a lower price. \n\u2018You want to have a beer?\u2019 He took me by surprise.\
  \  \n\u2018Let\u2019s grab some from the car and have one with them,\u2019 my boyfriend\
  \ offered and our new friend followed us to the car where we opened our overloaded\
  \ boot. \n\u2018Put them in a bag,\u2019 he said as I reached for the six-pack in\
  \ the esky. Actually, he insisted, the muscles in his jaw tightening. \u2018We need\
  \ a bag,\u2019 he repeated and then he started rumbling through our stuff while\
  \ looking over his shoulders. \n\u2018What are you doing? Calm down!\u2019  My boyfriend\
  \ didn\u2019t like the intrusion into our private space, and neither did I. The\
  \ man was acting weird. But, he was also persistent.\nI freed up an Aldi plastic\
  \ bag, and a smile returned to his wrinkled face. On our way from the car, grasping\
  \ the bag with both hands, he wanted to know if we were getting more beer tomorrow.\
  \ \n\u2018We go together.\u2019 He sounded desperate.\n Back in the shade, as soon\
  \ as we sat on the grass, the two women stood up, their eyes glinting. With raised\
  \ voices, the three of them split our six-pack in a hurry. Each took two beers,\
  \ and the women wrapped theirs like a secret in their clothing. Then, without a\
  \ word, they left. The two small artworks, depicting hunting scenes from the Dreamtime,\
  \ abandoned on the grass next to us.  \n\nWe returned to our tent in silence.\n\n\
  In days that followed we learned that Ayers Rock Resort was a \u2018dry zone\u2019\
  \ where Indigenous people caught drinking\u2014if they couldn't afford a hefty fine\u2014\
  \ ended up in prison. Alcohol abuse in the Northern Territory was the main culprit\
  \ for packed jails and high rates of early death among the Indigenous population.\
  \ I would have never guessed that the oldest civilisation of our planet was seriously\
  \ struggling with substance abuse. And that I, like many white men before me, would\
  \ contribute."
