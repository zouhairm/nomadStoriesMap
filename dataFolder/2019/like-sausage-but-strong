Text: "The most interesting building I ever drew was on the island Hvar, Croatia,\
  \ near the elbow of a bay a little inland. It\u2019s a small, hunched building with\
  \ a lot of stones you could miss entirely if you didn\u2019t have two hours to sit\
  \ and look. The woman who ran the place purchased the drawing from me with dinner.\
  \ We sat over it and she told me about every century every brick represented. The\
  \ shingles were by far the oldest, when a chain used to run across the bay to keep\
  \ ships away from the little town Stari Grad. The building was a restaurant now.\
  \ She made me Pa\u0161ticada, a local beef stew that always curled my toes.\n\n\
  The trickiest drawing was of Il Duomo di Firenze in Florence, Italy. I had never\
  \ seen it before and I would be lying if I didn\u2019t say it looked freakish. It\
  \ stands in a square flocked by literally everyone who visits the city, and by pigeons\
  \ and soldiers and violinists. You could see it over any rooftop you choose and\
  \ you couldn\u2019t eat a gelato slowly enough to walk along one side of it. That\
  \ ink drawing took 4 hours and was one of the hardest things I remember ever doing.\n\
  \nBut by far the hardest thing I ever did in pen was write a short note.\n\nI was\
  \ writing goodbye to my hosts Marko and Jelena just outside the walls at Dubrovnik,\
  \ a few years before Hollywood unsheathed that corner of the country. I had seen\
  \ a picture of it at work, booked a flight, and spent a week drawing a lot of it.\
  \ The houses there are like children at a school. Clean with bricks all a sunset\
  \ beige, and the floors shining. Upright and uniform until you get to know them.\n\
  \nYou won\u2019t find ruins today. You could, then. One midnight after dropping\
  \ his brother off at the barracks, Marko took me to a military hotel, or the rubble\
  \ of one after the last war. We lit the place in cellphone light and scrambled up\
  \ broken tile and stone to stand where a balcony used to be. We faced south and\
  \ the moon was up, so I could almost imagine Italy on the other side of the dark\
  \ blue Adriatic. Sisters of a kind, Italy and Croatia.\n\nMarko also taught me the\
  \ secret to a long life, and in all irony this was why that note took forever to\
  \ write.\n\n\u201CYou start,\u201D Marko said, \u201Cwith five yoga poses.\u201D\
  \ He showed me the poses. \u201CThen you take shot of rakia.\u201D\n\nThe hell is\
  \ rakia? \u201CCroatian liquor, is very good. You know the grappa?\u201D\n\nAh.\
  \ This, I knew.\n\nGrappa is alcohol made of leftover gunk that comes out of making\
  \ other alcohol. Like sausage, but strong. When grapes were stamped and done with,\
  \ their peels and stems and all the mush made this heinous stuff on the cheap. The\
  \ Croatians I asked didn\u2019t like it much.\nBecause, said Marko, \u201Cit doesn\u2019\
  t taste like anything.\u201D If you didn\u2019t count fire. \u201CSo we put stuffs\
  \ inside it for few months.\u201D\n\nBy \u2018stuffs\u2019, he meant herbs like\
  \ sage or dill or mint (they make travarica), or strawberries, walnuts, figs, rose\
  \ petals, mistletoe, anything that works with sugar and each with its own name.\
  \ My error was to ask how many flavours there were and how best to try them.\n\n\
  On my last night, Marko and Jelena stayed in. My flight left at noon the next day.\
  \ I\u2019d miss them when they left work so I needed to leave a note, a good one.\
  \ But right then I needed this one wall. I\u2019d gone to try a few rakia and was\
  \ several deep. Carob, roga\u010D, had been particularly nice. It was by then four\
  \ in the morning. I was almost home but the cliff spun, and the door had gone off\
  \ in the night.\n\nI know I made it, though I remember only clutching my pen like\
  \ an eagle for a very long time.\n\nMarko and Jelena still keep that page on their\
  \ wall. The last words on it: \u201C-or just come in.\u201D\n\nThe rest of it couldn\u2019\
  t even make rakia."
