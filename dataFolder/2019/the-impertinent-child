Text: "I craved for my father's approval and now i will never have it!\n\nI was 16\
  \ when i first fell in love with Pyramids and the Egyptian mystery. I can still\
  \ remember, the sleepless nights where I read history and fantasized about the Egyptian\
  \ lore under the bed covers aided by a torchlight. My love has not faded even after\
  \ 14 long years but my safe, secured and unadventurous upbringing didn't prepare\
  \ me for the struggle, I would have to face to travel to this beloved but estranged\
  \ destination. \n\nWhen I turned 18, my father had agreed to grant me permission\
  \ to travel to the land of Pharaohs, ALONE and i actually believed him. I should\
  \ have known better. He was a man of few words, many emotions but sadly a lot more\
  \ conservative ideals. To him, letting his eldest daughter solo travel in a Muslim\
  \ country was not only a matter of paternal concern but also a reckless abandonment\
  \ of the patriarchal system. It would set a precedent which unfailingly my younger\
  \ siblings would also follow. So instead, I got married at 23 and all but forgot\
  \ the dream to see the full moon rising over Nile.\n\n7 years have passed and from\
  \ where i stand today, neither am i the subservient daughter anymore nor am i scared\
  \ to reach out for what i want. But everything has changed and the battles are not\
  \ the same anymore. 2019 is the year which brought in this sense of determination\
  \ to finish what i started. I applied for my Egyptian tourist in January for my\
  \ solo travel but i was accosted with different queries THREE times under the pretext\
  \ of getting \"No Objection Certificate\" from a male member of my family , ideally\
  \ father or husband, proving that i am capable of financing my travel (I am a qualified\
  \ chartered accountant, self dependent and fairly traveled) and finally when i was\
  \ sanctioned visa, it arrived on the day i was supposed to depart. So i cancelled\
  \ the entire trip. All through my struggle this past month, I kept on thinking that\
  \ this is happening to me because I am not adhering to the wishes of my father.\n\
  \nToday, i have my visa, my passport, my travel ticket in my hand and i will be\
  \ travelling next month but i still don't feel the satisfaction set in because i\
  \ do not have my father to share this to. I lost him last year to heart attack and\
  \ since then my every step has been to make him proud. It's probably my worst imagination\
  \ that somehow if i undertake this travel and come home safe and sound, I will probably\
  \ win his approval. He is not present in the most basic physical form to see, feel\
  \ and hear what i am going through. But i am hoping against hope that all i do,\
  \ all i am, will make him proud.\n\nIt is only recently i have realized that this\
  \ journey was never about me, it was always about him. About how i wanted him to\
  \ see me. About how i wanted him to have faith in me. Trust me to take right decisions\
  \ and stand by me when I could not. So here i am all ready to take this momentous\
  \ decision with a heavy heart because i know\n\nthat\n\ni will never have his approval\
  \ anymore!"
