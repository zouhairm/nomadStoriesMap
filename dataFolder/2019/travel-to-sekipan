Text: "Indonesia has so many the best places with a good view. Everyone must agree\
  \ with that statement because it\u2019s the truth. Not only because have many cities,\
  \ many places but also have so many great tour places that we can visit every time\
  \ we want to. Every year, Indonesia always show up in new places. For example in\
  \ 2015, Indonesia with proud open the new tourist place called Sekipan. Even though,\
  \ Sekipan including new places but it\u2019s already being Instragamable places\
  \ for everyone who like to take a selfie with great places. I\u2019m being one of\
  \ the people who actually ever been there. Last week, I went to Sekipan with my\
  \ family. By using the bus, it takes 3 hours and luckily we don\u2019t get any traffic\
  \ jump during that. To be able to reach Sekipan, we must take another minibus and\
  \ since Sekipan still being a new object, people don\u2019t really or talk a lot\
  \ about that. Once I arrive at Sekipan, right that place can be one of the Instragamable\
  \ places. They actually have many spots object to take selfies. For example, we\
  \ can take a selfie with our 7 presidents and we can take selfies with a replica\
  \ from wonders of the world like Eifel tower, Pisa tower, Twins Tower and many more.\
  \ Not only we can take selfies but we also can enjoy many things there. We can watch\
  \ 8D about zombie\u2019s movies with a duration of at least 10 minutes and after\
  \ watch 8D, we can see a mini zoo. After that, I still do other things there and\
  \ I decided to ride a roller coaster, flying ships and bomb-bomb car. Sekipan is\
  \ really one of the recommended places for a short holiday and not only has that\
  \ Sekipan also had a small cottage called Japan villages and with using name \u2018\
  Japan\u2019, but the cottages also have used name Japan cities like Tokyo, Osaka\
  \ and Kyoto. The cottages are really comfy and clean. After full of journey on Sekipan,\
  \ I decide to go to look around and yet I found another places for us to take a\
  \ good selfie. Actually there one of selfies places called horror island and by\
  \ that call, that places have many replica of haunted house like Dracula, vampire,\
  \ and many more. Even though, I\u2019m one of the person who hated ghost, I decide\
  \ to go there and actually one of employee decide to dressed like a ghost and the\
  \ little boy who became a ghost actually nicer than I thought. After I took a pictures\
  \ with them, I joined with my family to have a lunch together. After I had lunch\
  \ with my family, I went along again to explore and around 2, I start to gather\
  \ myself since we have to leave, honestly I won\u2019t leaving that place yet since\
  \ I found that place actually nicer and comfy however I have to leaving with my\
  \ family."
