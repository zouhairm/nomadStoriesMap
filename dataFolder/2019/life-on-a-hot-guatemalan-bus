Text: "I was on a local bus in Guatemala. We had just left a village with a Mayan\
  \ name with thirteen letters consisting of five Os, three Is and two Zs. The heat\
  \ inside the bus was sweat heavy hot. Even with the windows down there was no relief\
  \ until the bus reached 30 km and then the bus sprang to life with ventilated souls.\
  \ The bus was filled with men who wore cotton dresses and carried machetes. All\
  \ the men were lean and there was not a harder body on planet Earth. They were a\
  \ uniform dark tan. All their hair was cut crudely short and stuck out here and\
  \ there in patches. The men saturated their hair with coconut oil and their hair\
  \ shinned. The girl I was with said these people believe they descended from monkeys\
  \ in the jungle. The men stared straight at me over their shoulders and some with\
  \ blatant stares. I wasn't about to make friends with smiles. I had my game face\
  \ on, that is, I had my blue eyed white game face on.  I stared straight ahead out\
  \ the driver window intend on the next turn in the road. Expressionlessly I was\
  \ the sojourner, the rover, the man one with the road and the ride. \nThen the bus\
  \ down shifted and braked and came to a stop. The driver and many of the passengers\
  \ go off and looking out a window I could see they were all taking a group pee break.\
  \ I decided to join them too. I stood near the rear of the bus, zipped down my fly\
  \ and...well, you know. That is when I looked up and saw faces pressed against windows\
  \ and people staring out open windows at me. One man and stuck his body half out\
  \ a window to get a better look. I moved to off the road and some meters into the\
  \  jungle.\nThe heat crushed us again as we all got back on the bus and headed deeper\
  \ into the jungle, volcanic peaks out of cracked window glass. The whine of the\
  \ gears and squeaky brakes were somehow reassuring. Then the bus picked up enough\
  \ speed and the wind gashed threw the open windows and again the world was sweet,\
  \ real and now. The magic bus flew down the road, the fastest it traveled all day\
  \ and the wind roared through windows and hair flew and dust rose and it made you\
  \ feel weightless as you sped down the road. For one moment you are lost to the\
  \ world... And I felt alive.\nThen the bus returned to a stop and hot, cool and\
  \ go routine and I was the again the determined traveler. Nothing could stop me\
  \ now. But I was wrong.\nSoon the bus came to a stop and I looked up and we were\
  \ surrounded by soldiers with rifles. The bus door creaked open  and soldiers in\
  \ green fatigues and M16s got on and they walked down the bus aisle looking at everybody\
  \ with close inspection. That is when i knew this white face and great smile would\
  \ not help me. Nor would the steely look of the ancient mariner get me out of approaching\
  \ doom. Quickly my blue eyed soul was standing outside on the road while two soldiers\
  \ went through ny backpack like children on a sugar high  on Christmas morning opening\
  \ presents. I looked up and the windows again were filled with faces. This was high\
  \ entertainment. \nFinding nothing of interest in my backpack of dirty clothes and\
  \ odd assortment of angles and dents, they let me hurriedly stuff all the stuff\
  \ back into my backpack. When I got back on the bus I looked down the bus and froze,\
  \ every face with mouth open stared at me again like I had escaped the devil. Maybe\
  \ I had."
