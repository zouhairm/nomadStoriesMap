Text: "I\u2019d never shared a bedroom with a strange man 30 years my senior before.\
  \  And certainly not at the top of a mountain.\n\nYet here I was with Enrique, a\
  \ retired businessman from Barcelona with small round glasses perched on his long,\
  \ straight nose. Truth be told, I was happy for a roommate after a long trek on\
  \ three modes of empty public transit.   \n \n                                 \
  \                         ------------                             -------------\
  \                       ------------\n\nEarlier that day, the Catalan Pyrenees finally\
  \ came into view.  Sunlit rock facades, filled with as many intricate folds as a\
  \ crumpled paper bag, rose into the spring-blue sky.  \n\nI sought the solitude\
  \ of nature after five days in Barcelona.  So that morning, with little planning,\
  \ I booked a hostel far from the city: Pic de l\u2019\xC0liga, accessible only by\
  \ foot or the mysterious-sounding cremallera.\n\nMy train rolled into Ribes de Freser,\
  \ the end of the line.  The last cremallera was in two hours, so I traced the river\
  \ towards town.   Several  bridges spanned the icy water, and on the other side\
  \ lay boutique hotels and ski shops nestled among castle ruins.  Yellow ribbons,\
  \ the mark of the Catalan independence movement, streamed from the railings of every\
  \ bridge.  \"LLIBERTAT,\" proclaimed the ribbon from a blasted-rock hillside.  A\
  \ Pyrenean peak rose from the valley beyond, a giant\u2019s head that swallowed\
  \ up the river.  Even the giant couldn\u2019t see Madrid from here.  \n\nI\u2019\
  d come to Spain solo craving my own independence.  But the language barrier soon\
  \ felt isolating, and I longed for deeper conversation.  \n\nI might have called\
  \ the cremallera a \u2018trolly\u2019 at first sight, but as it climbed deeper into\
  \ the Pyrenees, I decided this was no tame carnival ride. To my right I saw nothing\
  \ but a sheer cliff drop that spiked my adrenalin.  Each twist and turn up the Riu\
  \ N\xFAria gorge wrung the loneliness out of me. \n\nWe lurched to a stop in the\
  \ Vall de N\xFAria. Sharp glacial air swatted my face. In the bowl of the valley\
  \ sat a sweeping grey structure resembling an army barracks. The sanctuary-turned-ski\
  \ resort dated back to an 8th-century pilgrimage site frequented by shepherds. \
  \ \n\nI clambered onto the gondola for the last leg of my journey.  I was the sole\
  \ rider on a Sunday eve after the close of ski season. The sun began to sink rapidly,\
  \ turning snowy peaks into shadowy crags.  I was tired and cold.  I began to wonder\
  \ if my quest for \u2018independence\u2019 was just a way to mask loneliness.\n\n\
  The only other guests in the barebones hostel that night were a group of squirrelly\
  \ students and their chaperones.  Enrique and I bonded over tea in the cafeteria,\
  \ discussing life, work, and his plan for a month-long alpine hike in the summer.\
  \  \n\nI asked him about the yellow ribbons. With a nationalist movement brewing\
  \ back home, I couldn't understand the desire to close off to the world when the\
  \ privilege of travel had enriched my own life so deeply.\n\n\u201CYou see,\u201D\
  \ Enrique said, \u201Cthe Catalan people have nothing to do with Madrid.  We don\u2019\
  t share the same language.  We come from different cultures.  They do not understand\
  \ us.\u201D  \n                                                         ------------\
  \                             -------------                       ------------\n\
  \nThe next morning, we said goodbye after a breakfast of ham and bread.  I plucked\
  \ my way slowly down the steep rocky trail, hearing only the cascading N\xFAria.\
  \  The Giant was moody at times, mottled gray by shadows or by turns inviting where\
  \ sunlight bathed rock in oranges and golds.  Side paths lead to grottos and shrines\
  \ left by pilgrims.\n\nAs the green valley floor neared, the air softened.  The\
  \ trail flattened and gave way to pastoral hills dotted with thatched-roof stone\
  \ houses.  I heard a gentle clinking of cowbells upwind, and knew I was not alone:\
  \ a dozen blond beasts with gentle eyes were lying in the grass.  \n\nI arrived\
  \ back in Ribes de Freser.  Maybe the people tying yellow ribbons all over Catalonia\
  \ weren\u2019t just pulling away from people that seemed different.  Maybe they\
  \ desired to inhabit their language and land, their history and culture, in rich\
  \ solitude.  Maybe they were trying to give space to their own sense of identity,\
  \ so that they might feel the great comfort of belonging.  \n\nMaybe sometimes,\
  \ it is independence that makes us feel we belong."
