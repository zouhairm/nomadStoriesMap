Text: "Born and brought up in the former Portuguese Indian territory of Goa, I moved\
  \ out for the first time ot of my native place at the age of nineteen for a period\
  \ which lasted for upto five long years in the South Indian city of Chennai,formerly\
  \ known as Madras under British India.\n\nIn an already diverse nation of India,this\
  \ South Indian metropolis of the majorly Tamil community was just the right challenge\
  \ for an individual to make a connect with a city that was way different then the\
  \ rest of the Indian metros where the Indian language of Hindi is widely understood\
  \ and spoken.\n\nSo just striking the chord to make a local connection; the mothertongue\
  \ of the city was my first target to accomplish,a language that sounded so unfamiliar\
  \ to the sound of the languages that I was familier with be it Konkani the native\
  \ Goan language; English the language of the Colonial India; Portuguese the language\
  \ of the Colonial Goa,Marathi the language of our neighbouring state similar to\
  \ my native tongue or Hindi the language of the majority of the Indian people. \n\
  \nAlong with these languages and the corresponding cultural influences I ventured\
  \ on my journey to make a connect with the local population where majority of its\
  \ people communicated in Tamil,a language so unfamiliar to me both in its written\
  \ and verbal form.\n\nBuilding the connect was not just about bridging the gap of\
  \ the dissimilarities with the place but also filling the voids with the similarities\
  \ which I discovered with the city compared to that of my native place noticeably\
  \ the spicy seafood and other non vegetarian dishes & the wide influence of the\
  \ Christian religion in the city along with other predominant religions of Hinduism\
  \ and Islam which undoubtedly made me feel more at home rather then in a different\
  \ city.\n\nBut however in a place where minute the person next to you knows you\
  \ cannot communicate in their local language you are just overlooked, it was without\
  \ doughbt the only option to make them feel you are one of them; and this could\
  \ only be achieved by having a tongue that could blend with their own mother tongue.\n\
  \nStarting with the basics to converse with autodrivers to bargaining in the local\
  \ market to striking a conversation with a fellow Chennaite in a friendly respectful\
  \ word like saying hello brother and thank you sister in the Tamil Language.It was\
  \ a just a dip in a distinct culture and it's people of a one of the cities of the\
  \ diverse India,a nation as vast and diverse as Europe and it's unique countries.\n\
  \nSo words started entering my vocabulary through translations that compared a word\
  \ or phrase of English to that of Tamil which in turn  compared to my mothertongue.One\
  \ to Une to Ek,Two to Rende to Donn,three to munn to teen...water to tanni, Brother\
  \ to Anna ,Sister to Akka,How are You to epdi irka, Thank you to Nendri and my favourite\
  \ phrase 'I love You' which in Tamil was naan unai kaadalekerin with the word Kadaal\
  \ meant Love..\n\nThe love that helped and encouraged me to keep strengthing my\
  \ local connect with the city in all its beauty,grace,glory at the same time embracing\
  \ its distinct unfamiliar flavour that only nurtured me as a better human;because\
  \ there goes a saying among the cityfolks that If you survive in Chennai you can\
  \ survive in any other city of the sub continent and it actually holds so true..\n\
  \nIt's only when you venture out in the unknown one starts embracing the known...and\
  \ starts cherishing the unknown as the new known; all well accomplished by making\
  \ that connect with the heart and soul local tribe with the best vibes.\n\nVibes\
  \ that come out only if we experience the place by indulging in it by blending in\
  \ the best way possible."
