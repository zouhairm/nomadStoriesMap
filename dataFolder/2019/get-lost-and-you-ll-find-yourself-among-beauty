Text: "Traveling the world, stepping into a different world, creating memorable experiences,\
  \ spoiling yourself to a luxury of a lifetime, admiring historic and cultural sites,\
  \ or whatever your intention is, vacations are just simply remarkable.\n\nBut what\
  \ if the destination that you have carefully planned is too crowded? The beach in\
  \ Nice that you planned to lay down all day was too crowded so you couldn't even\
  \ find a place to sit, waited in long lines just to get in to the Louvre Museum,\
  \ too noisy, too stressful, perfectly ruining your expectation.\n\nThanks to the\
  \ digital era, the most popular destinations get crowded with tourists nowadays,\
  \ from winter to summer, who outnumber locals by many multiples, selfie-sticks are\
  \ everywhere and ruining the scenery. The massive growth of internet, social media,\
  \ especially Instagram in recent years has changed the way we travel. The power\
  \ of social media in some aspects may bring positive impact like boosting the local\
  \ economic growth and supporting potential job creation, but too many tourists can\
  \ have negative impacts on the quality of life and the essence of traveling itself.\n\
  \nInstagram photos are changing the way we travel. The way we plan our list of must-see\
  \ sites are more likely to be defined by a photo seen on Instagram rather than we\
  \ research ourselves. Some people choose their destinations based on what\u2019\
  s currently trending on social media, while others just following wherever their\
  \ favorite celebgram went for holiday and try to produce the same picture with the\
  \ same angle to be posted on Instagram.\n\nIndeed, usually we will choose to visit\
  \ the major popular cities at the first time, stopover to the world's most visited\
  \ tourist attractions. However, there is a price we must to pay, we will spend more\
  \ time struggling through tour group with annoying tour guides\u2019 voice via a\
  \ megaphone than enjoying the atmosphere of the city.\n\nTraveling for me is not\
  \ focusing on where I want to end up, but to take life a little less seriously,\
  \ unplanned, just enjoying the present in the moment. So, when the place I visit\
  \ is being extremely crowded, then I like to avoid crowds and liberate myself to\
  \ get lost. Walking away from crowded top-listed recommended destination that circulated\
  \ online. It is the time when I can rethink about my life, rediscover my goal, while\
  \ I have lots of time to explore the city, take mesmerizing photos, and create my\
  \ own experience. \n\nYes, we all want those iconic Eiffel Tower in the same spot\
  \ as seen on Instagram, or postcard back in the old days. But it is like a ballet\
  \ performance, don\u2019t sit too close to the stage because you get a much better\
  \ picture of the whole from further back in the audience. When I decided to get\
  \ away from the crowded popular tourist destinations, I could see overall beauty\
  \ of the place that I visited, a fascinating aesthetic of Alexander III bridge can\
  \ only beautifully capture from a distance, not on it. And that was moment I said,\
  \ \u201CWow, I didn\u2019t expect to find this beauty!\u201D\n\nHow many of you\
  \ have witnessed that a lot of people get the chance to visit Louvre Museum to see\
  \ Mona Lisa but just to see through the display of their own smartphone rather than\
  \ looking directly at the painting. The snapshot-and-post immediately attitude has\
  \ become the primary experience, been there, done that, got the snapshot, and posted\
  \ on Instagram to prove it.\n\nInstagram creates a fake world, just want us to show\
  \ the better part of things with filtered. Because that edited image is the one\
  \ that will gain more likes and followers. Sometimes when we travel, we\u2019re\
  \ trying too hard to impress everyone that you have been in the popular top must\
  \ visited, waiting for likes and loves, but forget to create our own story. Don\u2019\
  t be afraid to be alone, walk a little or more miles from popular sites, you will\
  \ be amazed eventually when you should see the beauty you will find on your path,\
  \ and that will make your journey becomes much more meaningful. It\u2019s not about\
  \ the destination, it\u2019s the journey that really matters, your journey."
