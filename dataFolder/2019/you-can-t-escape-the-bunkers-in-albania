Text: "They're everywhere. UFO-shaped ones dot the roadside throughout the country,\
  \ great cavernous ones are carved into the sides of mountains and web-like tunnels\
  \ weave beneath the city streets. Between the 1960s and the 1980s, more than 170,000\
  \ were built. In a country about one eighth the size of The UK, you really can\u2019\
  t escape them.\n\nWhen I reached Gjirokast\xEBr, I\u2019d been in Albania for nearly\
  \ a month. I\u2019d seen bunkers turned into museums, art galleries, coffee shops\
  \ and bars. I thought I'd seen everything a bunker could be. I\u2019d left the town\
  \ for the short hike to the Ali Pasha bridge, an Ottoman bridge crossing a small\
  \ valley, now mostly used by shepherds. It was the height of summer and the valley\
  \ the bridge spanned was parched. At the bridge, I bumped into another hiker. His\
  \ name was Rasmus and he was volunteering at the hostel I was staying in. The hostel\u2019\
  s owner had given him directions to some deep, unexplored bunkers about an hour\u2019\
  s hike into the mountains from where we stood. More bunkers.\n\nThe directions weren\u2019\
  t as helpful as we\u2019d hoped. After three hours we\u2019d almost had enough and\
  \ were ready to head back to town. Then, we saw them. Two glorious black holes dug\
  \ into the side of the mountain, looking at us like a pair of empty eye-sockets.\
  \ We had no idea if these were the bunkers we were looking for or some of the other\
  \ 173,370. We didn\u2019t care.\n\nWe climbed down to them. There we two parallel\
  \ tunnels, drilled into the sheer face, reinforced with concrete. In front of them\
  \ was a flattened area of concrete with signs of an old fire and some empty beer\
  \ bottles. We walked into the first one with only our phone lights to see by. The\
  \ light from the gaping openings only seemed to make it a few feet before being\
  \ beaten back by the blackness. We walked further in, shifting aside broken glass.\
  \ Ahead of us we could make out the shape of a second doorway. We moved closer and\
  \ could see something in it. It looked like someone had left a coat hanging there.\
  \ It stank. We got closer and could see that whatever it was had fur. Our phone\
  \ lights reflected back at us from the creature\u2019s eye. We saw its snout and\
  \ its teeth where it\u2019s cheek had decomposed. It was hanging by its neck from\
  \ a chain attached to a hook in the centre of the doorway. It was a dog. We backed\
  \ off. We tried to stay quiet until we got close to the daylight of the tunnel opening\
  \ and then sprinted out.\n\nWe were both a little shaken but had no idea what to\
  \ make of it. We headed in to the second tunnel. We edged in, more cautious this\
  \ time, until our eyes adjusted and we could see. The tunnel had the same layout\
  \ as its neighbour. Our eyes knew what to look for and, sure enough, in the second\
  \ doorway we saw the carcass of a dog hanging by a chain. It was fresher than the\
  \ last one and had not yet begun to decompose. \n\n\u201CLook down\u201D, said Rasmus,\
  \ shining his light to the side of the tunnel. There were more carcasses. At least\
  \ two. It was difficult to tell. They were heavily decomposed with pieces of green\
  \ wire around their necks. We ran back out into daylight.\n\nWe thought it a good\
  \ idea to hike back to town. On the walk back we threw out theories: kids messing\
  \ about? The den of a budding serial killer? Warnings put up by people living in\
  \ the bunker? They all sounded ridiculous but what else could explain what we\u2019\
  d seen?\n\nLater that night, an American man came up to us at the hostel. He\u2019\
  d heard our story and said he had a friend who was a journalist back in the states.\
  \ I didn\u2019t understand what I\u2019d seen, but Albania was the country I\u2019\
  d always felt safest hitchhiking in, always been made to feel welcome. We refused\
  \ to tell him the directions, not wanting to be responsible for a clickbait article\
  \ encouraging a Western audience, already primed\u2014 wrongly\u2014 to fear Albania."
