Text: "Last year me and my boyfriend Kanat decided to travel from Astana, the capital\
  \ of Kazakhstan, to Almaty, former capital city. The plan was to celebrate my birthday\
  \ and have an incredible summer experience in one of the most beautiful cities of\
  \ our country. Having seen restaurants, pools, theaters, museums and even clubs,\
  \ we were eager to see something new and decided to go to nature, more precisely\
  \ Kolsay lakes. \nWe searched internet, found \"travel +\" company and our vacation\
  \ started the next day. The bus driver drove all night long and early in the morning\
  \ we reached the place. \nKolsay lakes are located high in Kungey mountains and\
  \ we were settled in the village right next to one of the lakes. Since it is a small\
  \ village and there are no hotels and we were hosted by Kulash tate (aunt in Kazakh)\
  \ in her house. Kulash tate welcomed us very warmly and was very hospitable. She\
  \ gave us spacious room full of light and made delicious food for breakfast: baursaks,\
  \ homemade strawberry and raspberry jam, fresh salad that she had grown in her backyard,\
  \ yogurt, and plov and made sure we ate everything. \nAlong with shay (national\
  \ tea) Kulash tate told us some legends about the place and stories of the past\
  \ days. One of the stories was that there were two families that had been friends\
  \ for years. One family had one son and the other family had three daughters. All\
  \ three girls were in love with the boy and the boy could not choose any of them.\
  \ When they all came with this problem to their parents, the parents decided to\
  \ turn daughters into lakes and the boy into a river. Today they are known as Kolsay\
  \ lakes and river.\nThe village turned out to be located 7 kilometers away from\
  \ the first lake and we went for three hours. The road was muddy after the rain\
  \ and we were all wet and dirty, but still cheerful and happy because of magnificent\
  \ scenery that unraveled before us. I was stunned. The mountains, forests and cold\
  \ river were so pure and beautiful I could not stop staring and sighing. \nStep\
  \ by step mountain roads widened and we reached the first lake. It was crystal clear\
  \ and a lot of the tourists made a sip of water from it. Looking at the bottom of\
  \ the river I saw some trees deep deep down in the blue waters that fell from the\
  \ forest located above probably forced by some natural calamity. Above the water\
  \ there were thick dark clouds that changed their forms as if trying to terrify\
  \ us. In a minute it started to rain.  The view was breathtaking. Meanwhile some\
  \ of the tourists got undressed under the rain,  entered ice cold water and enjoyed\
  \ themselves. \nWe moved forward. In an hour we reached the second lake which was\
  \ as beautiful as the first one, but larger The horizon was virgin, not many people\
  \ could reach this place due to the distance and dull weather. We found an abandoned\
  \ road that led us to an old bridge. Having crossed the bridge we found ourselves\
  \ above the lake at the most romantic place you can imagine. \nWe were willing to\
  \ go to the third lake, but it turned out that it is located in the territory of\
  \ another country and we were not allowed to trespass. We walked back as quickly\
  \ as we could to keep warm and run away from the rain, but still managed to come\
  \ back to the village a few hours after the sunset. On seeing us cold, hungry and\
  \ dirty Kulash tate decided to show Kazakh hospitality and made monsha (Kazakh sauna),\
  \ so that we did not fall ill. Later we had dinner and had a lot of tea. Summer\
  \ evening turned into a dark night, but it was warm with a cup of tee and your loved\
  \ one by your side. Long conversations followed. Kulash tate said that she is one\
  \ of a few interpreters in the village and that she wants to go \"online\" in order\
  \ to show Kazakhstan and the beauty of Kolsay lakes to everyone."
