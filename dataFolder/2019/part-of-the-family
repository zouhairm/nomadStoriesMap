Text: "Dusk was settling in around us, as we drove through the salt flats, trying\
  \ to discern the most recently traveled path. In the fading light, it was increasingly\
  \ difficult to tell which track led where, and which led to a silty mess. Every\
  \ few moments, my husband stopped the truck, and got out, moving away from the vehicle\
  \ with caution, and sliding through the slick sand. \"Nope.\" He said with concern,\
  \ each time he returned. \n\nHe backed the truck up and tried path after path until\
  \ he found one that seemed safe. It was fully dark now, and the moonless night folded\
  \ around us like a blanket. The somewhat worn road twisted before us and seemed\
  \ like the right one, but my stomach did somersaults with anxiety anyway. It felt\
  \ like being in the climatic peak of a B-Movie, and not in a good way.\n\nWe drove\
  \ for what seemed like forever, going slowly as to avoid any surprises, common on\
  \ Baja backroads. Cows, potholes, slick salt that turns quicksand-like without warning.\
  \ Anything and everything can happen if you are overly cautious off-roading in Baja.\
  \ My apprehension was not fading, even though the road was good. The dark horizon\
  \ was concealed in a thickening mist, making the night even more ominous. \"Are\
  \ you sure this is the right way?\" I asked, trying not to sound negative.\n\nInstead\
  \ of answering, he stopped the truck and we sat in silence for a few moments. The\
  \ kids were asleep in the back, their soft snoring the only sound in the vehicle.\
  \ It was quiet, peaceful. I felt like maybe we should just camp here. Suddenly,\
  \ the flash of headlights darted across the road behind us. Another vehicle was\
  \ approaching, and fast. My heart skipped a beat. \"This proves it's the right road,\"\
  \ I tried to tell myself. But my stomach knotted tighter. This was what you read\
  \ about in worst-case-scenario stories. \n\nMy husband felt differently. He got\
  \ out of the truck and flagged down the other vehicle. It was a beat-up pickup,\
  \ towing a panga. They were fishermen, and they were headed home for the night.\
  \ Home was the town we were looking for. They offered to lead the way, for a beer,\
  \ and we were on our way. I still felt unsettled but trusted my husband's instinct.\
  \ \n\nWe followed as the pickup raced over dunes, and twisted through the salty\
  \ desert until the lights of a small village came into view. A wave of relief washed\
  \ over me, my stomach let go of its knot, and I sighed. The twinkling lights of\
  \ the homes was like a ticker-tape parade. The fishermen led us to their home, and\
  \ we all introduced ourselves. We asked where we could camp for the evening, and\
  \ Rudolfo gestured widely to his back yard. \"You'll stay here, with us!\" \n\n\
  He then brought us inside, to meet his wife and daughter, and showed us their cozy\
  \ home. They shared a neighbor's birthday cake with our kids, and we spent an hour\
  \ or so trading stories. When it was time to sleep, Rudolfo insisted we stay in\
  \ his home, where we would be warmer. His daughter happily gave up her bedroom for\
  \ us, with her soft bed, and set up cushions and blankets on the floor for our kids.\
  \ \"You're part of the family, now,\" Rudolfo exclaimed. \"Family doesn't sleep\
  \ outside.\" We couldn't refuse the generous hospitality. \n\nWe slept deeply in\
  \ the comfortable confines of their humble beachside bungalow. In the morning, the\
  \ family was insistent that we have a good breakfast before heading out. Rudolfo\
  \ rode his bicycle to the corner tienda, and returned with eggs and bread, while\
  \ his lovely wife made fresh coffee and squeezed oranges for juice for the children.\
  \ The feast they prepared was fit for family. \n\nI didn't expect to find family\
  \ that evening, but the universe had other ideas."
