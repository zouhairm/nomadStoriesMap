Text: "\u201CHey, we were here first!\u201D, I heard from the other side of the street\
  \ as I sat down in front of the door of the tiny currency exchange office to wait\
  \ until it would open. I looked up and saw a bald middle-aged man in sunglasses.\
  \ He was pointing to the senior in a loose shirt chewing on a toothpick and a young\
  \ woman holding a bicycle in shorts and a black T-shirt that said \u201Csexy\u201D\
  . I was completely confused as they weren\u2019t even close to the door and I had\
  \ thought that they were just hanging around\u2026 Apparently, I was wrong. \nThey\
  \ came over and I stood up as quickly as a child caught red-handed. I had broken\
  \ the holy rules of the queue! The man looked up at me, as I was a bit taller, and\
  \ explained in Spanish that my turn would be after the woman\u2019s. Having seen\
  \ me accept that, he turned to her shaking his head and said, \u201CShe doesn\u2019\
  t know how we queue here\u201D.\nBy here he meant Cuba, one of the few communist\
  \ countries left after the collapse of the Soviet Union. I decided to visit this\
  \ Caribbean island mostly to check out the newest salsa moves; thought that it would\
  \ also be interesting to see how people lived in a different system, but wasn\u2019\
  t expecting much more than that. Little did I know that this ten-and-a-half-hour\
  \ flight on a plane with \u201CLa Habana\u201D proudly written in the front had\
  \ taken me back to my parents\u2019 youth \u2013 the times when only one point of\
  \ view was allowed, when people called each other through payphones and when shops\
  \ didn\u2019t have enough goods to fill up the shelves. After so many years of just\
  \ hearing what life in the Polish People\u2019s Republic (short in Polish: PRL)\
  \ was like, I was standing in one of the ubiquitous queues just like my parents\
  \ and grandparents did. \nUsually when I\u2019m waiting, I\u2019m busy on my phone.\
  \ Here, my phone had no connection and WiFi was accessible only in parks with a\
  \ special card, so I watched the queue build up. It was like observing a social\
  \ event unfold. New guests were arriving and greeting those present, while others\
  \ just showed up, remembered their spot and went away to run some other errands\
  \ before it would be their turn.\n\u201C\xBFLa \xFAltima?\u201D, a young, handsome\
  \ man asked who was the last one in line as he approached the growing group. Given\
  \ an answer, he jumped off his bike and engaged in a chat about the family\u2019\
  s health and how it\u2019s impossible to save any money when one doesn\u2019t even\
  \ have enough to make it to the next month.\nI watched them and felt like a time-traveler.\
  \ In a way, having collected experiences so typical for the everyday life in Poland\
  \ some decades ago brought me closer to my own roots, to my own culture and to my\
  \ own family. I was no longer one of the lucky kids that would treat their parents\u2019\
  \ stories like phantasy books and ask in disbelief: \u201CSo you mean that there\
  \ were empty shelves in Carrefour?\u201D. I was now the one going to a shop that\
  \ lacked goods as basic as water, and having to queue for what felt like forever\
  \ for a box of cookies. I was the one walking down the street and seeing (almost)\
  \ completely empty stores and, a couple of meters further, huge lines that made\
  \ me wonder what stock had just arrived. I was the one eating cheese that my host\
  \ had gotten on the black market, because it was the only way to get it that day.\
  \ \nOne of the bored-looking exchange office workers wearing the black-and-white\
  \ short uniforms opened the door, and the seemingly chaotic group entered in the\
  \ exact order of arrival. Soon, I exchanged my money and continued my time-travel\
  \ to collect even more experiences I could share with my parents later to all of\
  \ which they would react the same way:\n\u201CYeah, just like in the PRL.\u201D"
