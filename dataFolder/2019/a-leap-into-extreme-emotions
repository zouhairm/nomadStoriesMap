Text: "It was too late to give up. The plane had already spiraled up, shaking all\
  \ over. A little single-engine aircraft with only the pilot cabin and four passengers'\
  \ places, without any seat belts for us, without any seats at all. \n\nThe early\
  \ rain was over and the day was getting sunny. The remaining clouds were scattering\
  \ the light, painting the sky with different shades of blue, from the turquoise\
  \ to the indigo. As much as I've had already flown over Fortaleza several times,\
  \ being on a non-pressurized airplane, very close to those clouds, actually touching\
  \ them, and feeling the temperature going down while we were going up, was an entirely\
  \ new experience. \n\nI also have more than a small square window, which gives me\
  \ a panoramic view of the whole capital and the places as far as the eye can see.\
  \ Fortaleza, my hometown, is a seaside city in northeastern Brazil, known for its\
  \ beaches. So from east to north, the Atlantic Ocean; from west to south, the hills\
  \ of Pacatuba and Maranguape and in all other directions an endless flat green land\
  \ with small lagoons and a bunch of buildings showing civilization.\n\nWhen my friend\
  \ Rachel invited me to parachute, I firstly said \"Oh, I would love to do it, but\
  \ I'm letting that adventure for my seventies. You know, there are too many things\
  \ I would like to do before I die.\" She laughed and insisted. \"Let's go! I know\
  \ you are adventurous.\"  She was right, who I was kidding? Indeed I love adventures,\
  \ and that was the only thing I was looking for when I said \"Okay\": an exciting\
  \ experience.\n\nBut I panicked! My leap was not only into the sky but also into\
  \ extreme emotions unknown. I panicked when Comandos, my tandem master, started\
  \ to connect my skydiving suit to the harness attached to him. I panicked when he\
  \ reminded me of the instructions - head back, chest forward, knees arched. I panicked\
  \ when he opened the plane's door.  \"I DON'T NEED TO LEAP.\" \"THIS AIRCRAFT FLIGHT\
  \ IS GOOD ENOUGH.\" \"LET'S GO BACK SAFE,\" I screamed, and he pretended not listening.\
  \ \n\nMy carotid was jumping before me. What a stupid idea! He is calm because of\
  \ his experience. He knows what to do if anything goes wrong. The parachute is attached\
  \ to him. I don't have my own. Not even a step one. What if my gear is not tightly\
  \ connected to him? What if I do something wrong? Did I lock the door? What if...\
  \ JUMP!!!!\n\nA thousand thoughts were gone in two seconds of the looping. The mind\
  \ is clean while the brain works hard trying to process a situation for which our\
  \ anatomy is not ready: fly. We're about 250 km/h in freefall. Time after time the\
  \ fear is replaced by happiness until I may not hide my biggest smile anymore. My\
  \ instructor deploys the parachute, suddenly stopping the fall, making me feel held\
  \ as if some force was pulling me to intentionally protect myself. Now we were smoothly\
  \ floating.\n\nMy heartbeat decreases as we approach the land. The adrenaline slows\
  \ down, and a calm that I didn't know existed radiates from the inside out.  We're\
  \ not on solid ground yet, but I already feel a serenity as we gently finish the\
  \ descent with the parachute open. From the most breathtaking experience to the\
  \ most relieving, a feeling of gratitude for being alive and reacting with all my\
  \ senses to what life has to offer every second.\n\nThen a little bit more adrenaline\
  \ induced by the acceleration necessary for the landing and we finally arrive. Safe\
  \ and sound. And so, all these different emotions occurring in such a short period\
  \ remind me that none of them, whether pleasant or not, last forever."
