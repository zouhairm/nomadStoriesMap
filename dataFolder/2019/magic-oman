Text: "In recent years I had the opportunity to travel to United Arabs Emirates to\
  \ join an International Education Convention. I travel with a friend and we wanted\
  \ to visited another place after the Convention. We did n\xB4t know too much about\
  \ the countries who limits with Emirates, so following an advise of a a known person\
  \ we took a plane to Oman. This is a country that borders the United Arab Emirates\
  \ to the northwest, with Saudi Arabia to the west and Yemen to the southwest. Its\
  \ capital is Mascate, the oldest city in the Persian Gulf.\nWhen we arrived  we\
  \ had no hotel reservation. We took a taxi and the chofer didn \xB4t speak english,\
  \ we said \"Mascat Hotels in the centre\" and he took us to the oldest hotel in\
  \ the city. It is dated from 1972 when the country changed its Sultan and its name.\
  \ The hotel it was so nice and picturesque that we decided to stay there. So we\
  \ went out to know the place. We walked a lot under a strong sun. Outside the houses\
  \ we met local women very smiling and kind, but they also did not speak English.\
  \ A young woman invited us to drink coffee and eat tradictional sweets with her\
  \ family. She was an university student of chemistry and she was bilingual. We learned\
  \ a lot about local customs and she and her sisters told us about role and opportunities\
  \ of omani women. I was surprissed because they have the chance to pursue higher\
  \ education. Then she drove us to the principal buildings, highlighting for its\
  \ beauty the Palace \"Al Alam\" residence of the Sultan. This is the only building\
  \ painted in colors, sky blue and gold, since the rest of the buildings are white.\n\
  The next day we had lunch in front of the sea and we met a local tourist guide.\
  \ He drove us to the most beautiful landscapes that I have seen before, seriously!\
  \ beyond the phrase. We met a lost beach in the desert inhabited only with birds,\
  \ a great crater left, according to legend, by the fall of a star and a cave that\
  \ can only be reached by swimming. We swam toward adventure.At first I had a lot\
  \ of fear but I didn\xB4t think to much and I let myself go for the moment. If I\
  \ looked up I could see the sky through a large hole in the rock of the cave. We\
  \ returned Mascate after a long walk in the heights and crossing in a deteriorated\
  \ Little boat. The Guide was  very friendly and requested, like all the omanies\
  \ we met.\nAt night we dinner in the hotel bar and we finished the night playing\
  \ pool with local customers. All of them were men because most women stay at home\
  \ at night in this arab country.\nThis travels was amazing for a lot of reasons\
  \ and I am grateful that in addition to knowing fabulous places I was able to get\
  \ closer to the locals and experience a little bit of their culture so far and different\
  \ form mine."
