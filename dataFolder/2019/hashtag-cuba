Text: "#HavanaVieja, where I have \"my house\" with the owner Alfredo who calls me\
  \ MI AMOR and says that I have the \"good luck\" thanks to my \"big smile\"; where\
  \ I always meet Toby and Angela, my neighbors on the plane; where I was lovingly\
  \ tricked by a Cuban guy who by chatting and chatting has convinced me to buy him\
  \ four \"rations\" of milk powder for 20 CUC and for this Ernesto, my personal guide,\
  \ will always remind me: \"he talked to you for 5 minutes and you bought him the\
  \ milk. If he talked to you for two hours you married him \"; where I met Ernesto,\
  \ my guide to survival, who never asks anything but is always present \"to do what\
  \ you want\", he does not drink does not smoke, does not dance. He who laughs a\
  \ little but reads Bukowski, Nietzsche and Kafka. He who has a secret that I managed\
  \ to discover and \"you are the first person in my life who asked me\", he told\
  \ me, while El Carnaval was heard playing in the background and a train of tourists\
  \ formed, amused and drunk with mojito and cuba libre that went down like water.\
  \ My little pays in the warmest and most magical ciudad of this corner of the world.\
  \ \n#Trinidad: \"it is high season in Trinidad you will not find a room easily,\
  \ you should take the first one that happens\", so it is Trinidad, full of tourists\
  \ but in the end it tooks ten minutes to find a room. All thanks to Teresa, a 40-year-old\
  \ Cuban woman who earns 10 cuc per month and who always wears white because white\
  \ is the purity\u2019s color in her religion. Trinidad is a small holiday village\
  \ where you start drinking mojito in the morning and you ends in the evening. It\
  \ seems to be in some seaside town of the Amalfi coast, with shops full of summer\
  \ clothes, canvas bags, postcards. Everything is tourist-friendly here. Fortunately,\
  \ we have Teresa who occasionally brings us back to reality and to Cuba, with her\
  \ Spaniard, her laugh and her spontaneous singing every time she hears a song coming\
  \ out of the stereo. In the evening the dance floor is all for los hombres that\
  \ point you, pull you and it is immediately salsa! \"Before leaving, I want to give\
  \ you a present\", Teresa told me and arrived with a little stone and whispered\
  \ to me \"it's for good luck, you need it and it will help you\". Encantada Teresa.\n\
  #SantaClara: Che's mausoleum, Che's statue with child, Che's T-shirts, Che's photos\
  \ in stores. For me, however, Santa Clara was a walk along the old railway, between\
  \ abandoned trains and hens that ran freely; a beer in the park near the bus station\
  \ and a plate of ham offered by the house \"to the only woman in the park\", that\
  \ was me; a conductor who asked us to delete a photo \"because you can photograph\
  \ all but not me, because if I go on the internet and see that I'm reading the newspaper\
  \ ...\" and then he invited us to dinner; Oasis Wonderwall along the way; a delicious\
  \ dish of \"ropa vieja\" at Hostal Florida; ice cream with meringue-flavored cream.\
  \ Santa Clara is a town on a human scale as Trinidad or Cienfuegos, but with much\
  \ less tourism (yes, because here the tourists pass only to see the statue of Che\
  \ and then they go). and at the same time cuban\u2019s life that exudes from the\
  \ streets, as it happened to feel in some corners of Havana. Santa Clara greeted\
  \ me with a 0.25 pesos for a coffee and our old white-haired taxi driver blue eyes\
  \ and burnt skin with a tight, tight accent, which me wished feliz nuevo a\xF1o.\
  \ Hasta Siempre C-lara."
