Text: "My legs burned with every step I took on the steaming pavement.  My heart raced\
  \ in panic as I combed through the jungle of people as I raced after my black bag\
  \ that was getting further and further out of reach.  As each second passed, my\
  \ body began to wear as it's deprived of oxygen.  My eyes sting as my sweat mixed\
  \ with tears.  In five minutes flat, I've lost everything.  My clothes, my laptop,\
  \ and my spirit were lifted when I lost the thief in a sea of people.\n\nI was alone\
  \ in Barcelona.  And at that moment, I remembered what my now former boss said just\
  \ before I left him earlier that morning.  \"You're nothing. I always get my way.\
  \  I will find you, and I will make your life a living hell.\"\n\nWhat should have\
  \ been a beautiful day, felt like I was melting under the Sun, evaporating into\
  \ nothing on the concrete walkways.  Swimming in my own sweat, I wandered in the\
  \ streets with my remaining belongings I had on me (my phone, passport, and wallet\
  \ with a few notes in it).  I stopped seeing the beauty I only saw a few moments\
  \ ago.  Colorful architecture, delicious foods and their aromas, and rhythmic language\
  \ I was once excited to learn had faded into the background.  I was devastated.\n\
  \nAs the asphalt cooled down, night life began and I found myself in a cozy little\
  \ eccentric bar with tasty drinks, a cute little downstairs theater hall, and even\
  \ better people.  The night before I had gone to an open mic night, and there I\
  \ met Ashley and Jake.  We became fast friends, and they invited me back to attend\
  \ an improv show that they were hosting for the first time that night.\n\nWe drank,\
  \ laughed, and when the show was over, went out for tapas.  Spending time with them\
  \ ebbed away the anxiousness I felt earlier in the day.  But as our evening began\
  \ to come to a close, Ashley noticed something off in my waning excitement.\n\n\u201C\
  What\u2019s wrong?  We\u2019re having a great time!\u201D\n\nThat alone opened a\
  \ floodgate that I had been holding back all day.  I recounted to them of the theft\
  \ and my more than inappropriate boss\u2019s advances towards me that ruined what\
  \ was supposed to be a month long gig in Spain.  She simply says, \u201CWe\u2019\
  ll figure it out.  You can stay with me until you do.\u201D\n\nThat weekend, they\
  \ helped me find a hostel in my price range and completely turned my sour mood into\
  \ an enjoyable one with their generosity and kindness.  Since they were just starting\
  \ improv, they attended multiple shows hosted by BIG (Barcelona Improv Group), and\
  \ encouraged me to come along.\n\nI attended wanting to support my new friends,\
  \ but found myself enjoying a new form of art I just discovered with each new show.\n\
  \n\u201CFirst rule of improv,\u201D one of BIG\u2019s performers announced at the\
  \ beginning of each show, \u201Cis to say yes.  Always say yes.\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  And the last rule of improv,\u201D another performer finishing their introduction\
  \ to the audience, \u201Cis that there are no mistakes, only opportunities.\u201D\
  \n\nWe hollered with laughter as they came up with side-stitching games, and giggled\
  \ when someone was singled out for a few of their sketches.  Everyone was having\
  \ a good time, and the mood was infectious.  The passion they had to entertain made\
  \ me forget most of my troubles.\n\nOne night as the show came to a close, everyone\
  \ stayed in the bar, having drinks as the actors mingled with the guests who strayed\
  \ behind.  I built up the courage to approach one of the performers that night to\
  \ compliment her show, and she regaled me with a tale of how improv changed her\
  \ life and how she was living here full time now to pursue her passion.  \"You know,\
  \ we offer workshops to show what improv is all about.  There's one tomorrow.  Do\
  \ you want to come?\"\n\nAfter everything since arriving, I had met more people\
  \ and found opportunities that I would have never known about had I wallowed in\
  \ self pity, and it turned my whole perspective around.\n\nRemembering the first\
  \ rule of improv, I simply say, \"Yes.\""
