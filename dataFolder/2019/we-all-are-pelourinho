Text: "Joyful streets filled with tears and blood that eyes can\u2019t see. This could\
  \ be a definition of Pelourinho, a neighborhood at Salvador, Bahia, Brazil.  It\
  \ is placed right in the center of Brazil\u2019s first capital. This city had the\
  \ honor of many politicians, artists, business man and other relevant people, call\
  \ it home. Vinicius de Moraes, one of the composers of \u201CThe Girl from Ipanema\u201D\
  , lived here for many years of his life, just to give one example. \n\nWalking my\
  \ feet and eyes through there made me feel so alive for jumping into nearly 500\
  \ years of history. There are people from all races. The ancient buildings in baroque\
  \ style are very colorful. All this not to mention the coolest Subway I have ever\
  \ seen. It was right in one of these building. Both Catholic Church and African\
  \ religions are very present. In the matter of spirituality, I don\u2019t believe\
  \ there is one religion not present in this city. \n\nAt every public square you\
  \ are bombard with culture, either through dance, like Capoiera, or music, with\
  \ Olodum, and definitely very talented people doing juggle. It is all contagious\
  \ and pulsing, inviting you to stay there and watch. It defines how Brazil is. A\
  \ very culture-race mixed people who embraces the different.\n\nHowever, I remember\
  \ when the streets of Pelourinho started to get narrower and my local guide told\
  \ me something about the way we were going through. It helped me see that not all\
  \ those flowers there were roses, sadly.\n\nHe explained that slaves were taken\
  \ to be punished, tortured and humiliated at Pelourinho, the rock column they were\
  \ tied in. I was surprised to see that there is nothing, besides the name, to refer\
  \ to this \u201Cjustice tool\u201D anymore. Some believe that keep the neighborhood\u2019\
  s name is enough to sustain the remembrance about this ugly side of history, others\
  \ disagree saying that history will be ignored even more if concrete actions come\
  \ out soon.\n\nCertainly, this place carries a relevant part of Brazil\u2019s history,\
  \ but it seems to me that efforts, especially those done by governments, are focused\
  \ to distance the ugly side from the beauty present ever since. A leap in the unknown,\
  \ every day, for thousands of people. Both tourists and locals. \nAlthough that\
  \ kind of slavery was abolished many years ago we can still see in those streets\
  \ the fruits of it, social inequality. The rich who used to live there left to other\
  \ places, leaving behind society\u2019s \u201Cdross\u201D. This intensified drugs,\
  \ prostitution, violence and poverty. \n\nThey all can sing Michael\u2019s Jackson\
  \ song:\n\u201CAll I want to say is that\nThey don't really care about us.\u201D\
  \n\nAt some extent we all are like Pelourinho. Beauty on the outside, but inner\
  \ wounds covered. We can\u2019t change history, but we must deal clearer with our\
  \ past so that those marks won\u2019t remain bleeding, and us pretending it is not.\
  \ There is a lot to tell about this place, much to be known. I would greatly rejoice\
  \ if this story inspires someone else to teach present and future generations about\
  \ this wonderful place."
