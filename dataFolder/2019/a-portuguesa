Text: "Reading Extract: \n\n[...] On the morning of her departure, Maria Terreira\
  \ asked me to join her. To the door, to the train\nstation, to Porto and to the\
  \ end of her life. I also wanted to want that, but I didn\u2019t even make it to\n\
  the station because the metro rides right in front of her house. Maria Terreira\
  \ remained\nmonosyllabic most of the time, but in her farewell, she said to me in\
  \ Portuguese that she had\nreally enjoyed the time with me (I think), and in English\
  \ that my heart isn\u2019t blind but wears\nmirrored sunglasses, which look cool\
  \ but are only there to protect from the self and the sun. But\nshe couldn\u2019\
  t take them off me. When the Blue Line drove her out of my life, it became clear\
  \ that\nshe was gone like the desire she had come with. I felt miserable on my short\
  \ trip home. As the\ndoor, which Maria Terreira had just opened, shut behind me,\
  \ I didn\u2019t need any of my twelve\nmorning espressos to feel alive. I asked\
  \ myself if I wanted a life that\u2019s dependent on overly\nhuman feelings, or\
  \ rather to live in freedom that feels like a greenhouse in which identical red\n\
  strawberries sprout. Should I relinquish my imagination for reality? [...]\n\nKonstantin\
  \ Arnold studied photography and journalism. The stories of the 28-year-old abduct\
  \ us into poetic worlds decorated with analogue imagery. They narrate adventurous\
  \ journeys across the globe, as well as everyday life - his written words always\
  \ dancing like short intense waves. He moved to Lisbon in search for true inspiration\
  \ & muse. Here he will also publish his first book, \u201CA Portuguesa\u201D in\
  \ Portuguese through Emportium Editora. The stories revolve around his life in Lisbon,\
  \ give insight into Portuguese society and portray the eclectic Lisboetas. Short\
  \ excerpts from his addressless letters are regularly published on his blog: bynd-mag.com\
  \ - you\u2019ll find a short reading extract in English on the next page. The author\
  \ also works for international magazines (Vice, Der Spiegel,..) and renowned newspapers\
  \ (Frankfurter Allgemeine, Neue Z\xFCrcher Zeitung, Zeitung, Die Welt,..).\n\nA\
  \ man without a smartphone but with a typewriter. A writer who moved to another\
  \ country to be free and perceive things that don't stand out at home. Someone who\
  \ looks strangers in the eye and smokes red Marlboros. People like Konstantin Arnold\
  \ hardly exist in today's world. Everything is\nuniform, adapted and always perfectly\
  \ arranged for Instagram. Konstantin is not just free from social constraints, but\
  \ also conceals a treasure of inestimable value, an inner wealth, something precious\
  \ that is lost if it is not packed into real sentences. \n\nThere will also be a\
  \ short film produced in Lisbon in 2019. Here the Directors View: \n\nWith \"Libertin\"\
  \ I want to bring the author's innermost to the outside. Put the authenticity of\
  \ his words\ninto pictures. Inspire with an artistically dreamy visual language\
  \ and touch with the poetry of the\nvoiceover. A vignette film that makes use of\
  \ the author's stories, arranging them in episodes and\nre-arranging them to provide\
  \ an entertaining insight into a special life. The film plays with lost profiles\n\
  and hints in order to always leave enough room for one's own imagination.\nThe short\
  \ film starts restlessly and introduces a story that is told by unaddressed letters.\
  \ Of\nsomeone who wants to break out of the impersonality of a life that is too\
  \ fast, to find his ideals in\nthe reality of everyday life in Lisbon. We meet people\
  \ of the city, like the charming old bookshop\nowner, with whom Konstantin likes\
  \ to play Backgammon. Throughout the story we\u2019ll discover\nnumerous authentic\
  \ treasures of Lisbon.\nA declaration of love to a city follows with a hidden love\
  \ story to a Portuguese girl (Climax). Places\nand streets fill with events. Memories\
  \ spread to large squares. Lisbon is Konstantin\u2019s personal\nrevelation: the\
  \ place where he ultimately finds muse, settles and publishes his first novel.\n\
  A film about ideals, love, devotion, literature and the power of a city, it\u2019\
  s culture and people.\n\nThere is a Movie & a Book Outline. Can be send on request."
