Text: "The first time in the sea, it wasn't red as i thaught when i was a child. It\
  \ was dark in that time of night when i arrived, but i felt it.\nSewakin island\
  \ there like an old wido staring with great ego and pride .\nIt was the 6th of march,\
  \ the end of winter and the very early beginnig of spring are the perfect times\
  \ to visit  Red sea. As the sun was rising , the torquoise water was an extraordinary\
  \ veiw for us who never saw awater surface but the great Nile with it's vital brown\
  \ water that flow shraply from the ethiopian highlanda.\nThe locals were donig there\
  \ morning swim, they told us that  it's aroutine to keep them healthy. They are\
  \ convinced that the salty water is a heal for their bodies and a blessing for their\
  \ souls. \n \"The women are the loins of their families \" that how the sheihk of\
  \ sewakin answerd us when we were wondering why we barely saw a woman since we arrived.\
  \ This speach made us with our faceless veils and tight jeans feel the worse.\n\
  The ghosts stories around the camp fire is not a very good idea as we spent the\
  \ day watching a goat drinking soft drinks and eating fish. The locals were insist\
  \ this goat is haunted and all the fat cata around us are able to talk.\nRudyard\
  \ kipling poem about the brave fighters of sewakin ubon the English occupation was\
  \ repeated aday after another . between the different translations and accents that\
  \ the poem was told with,  you cant help but to feel the greetings of sewakins fuzzy\
  \ valiant ghosts."
