Text: "I live in the confines of my own imagination, no sign of anxiety like mountains\
  \ dripping waterfalls of ambition, excitement and courage. I can always picture\
  \ anything...\"Make sure you take all your particulars, we are running late\", these\
  \ were my mother's words as she hopped into the car.\nI quickly snapped out of it\
  \ as I reluctantly nodded. \n\nI hastly forced a few clothing items into a small\
  \ bag.\nI had never been to our rural areas, the land of our forefathers all my\
  \ life so it was more special than any other adventure because it is key to who\
  \ I am as an African. When I heard my parents were leaving something told me to\
  \ tag along. We had embarked on many other adventures from camping to canooing and\
  \ so much more.\nI finally finished then took a step, the car swallowed me in and\
  \ we took off.\nI had just leaped into a horizon of curiosity and excitement so\
  \ I trusted dad to safely drive us till we reach our destination.\nBeknown to me\
  \ were the scorching boarders of Botswana we had crossed multiple times before,\
  \ just after leaving home or at least what I had called home all my life a blazing\
  \ hot Rustenburg in the North West Province of South Africa.\nWe drove past Botswana\
  \ headed towards our destination.\n\nHome is many things to many people and I was\
  \ about to erase my understanding of the word as I learn it once more. The drive\
  \ was a long one almost 17 hours so we had to start it in the afternoon so we arrive\
  \ in the early hours of the morning.\nWe were going to have many pit stops every\
  \ 4 to 5 hours just to eat,refresh and relax.\nI slept and woke up, repeated the\
  \ same process from dusk till dawn.\nAs we were leaving the congested city of Harare,\
  \ my eyes were greeted by vast stretches of green crops for it was a growing season.\n\
  Soon the farms faded slowly into dry bushes and scattered mud houses started appearing,\
  \ our drive was often disrupted by livestock crossing the dusty roads.\nI could\
  \ smell wild roses and a different scent, it was as if I'm in a new galaxy. \n\n\
  We went into a certain round mud hut roofed with dry grass,the sting of smoke that\
  \ arose from a fire in the center of the house with a large clay pot guarding it\
  \ made me sneeze and my eyes started watering.\nAll the ladies in the hut knelt\
  \ down as we greeted the elders, this is considered a sign of respect in the Shona\
  \ culture.\nWe were only spending a night there so I quickly freshened up, to my\
  \ disappointment I had to bathe in the stream nearby it was scary yet exciting.\n\
  Grandfather and I went to milk the cow and I just couldn't get it right.\nMuch to\
  \ my surprise what was served for breakfast was boiled corn mixed with boiled nuts\
  \ from a clay pot, the tea we drank was made of the warm milk we had just milked!\
  \ It was unbelievably delicious, it tasted way better than it looked.\n\nI was excited\
  \ to embark on all farm adventures and I couldn't help but be amused by the view,\
  \ trees revealed a fresh breeze and the sunkissed my skin. We left to plant some\
  \ seeds with a yoke tied to a cow.\nNetwork coverage wasn't great so I couldn't\
  \ immediately show my online friends the new lifestyle I had been exposed to.\n\
  When heritage is mentioned scenery of majestic rich soil, clear waters and loads\
  \ of vegetation flashed my mind but this time it was connecting with my roots in\
  \ the land of my forefathers.\nI retired to bed after an exciting day and oh what\
  \ I'm referring to as bed is a mat of smartly knitted dry grass with blankets on\
  \ top!!\nSeems like I had no reason to be anxious, fearful or uncertain.\nIf anything\
  \ it was the total opposite!\n\nA leap into the unknown led me here! Home sweet\
  \ home, Guruve a small district in the Mashonaland Province in Zimbabwe."
