Text: "Ibn Battuta famously quoted \u2018traveling \u2013 it makes you speechless\
  \ and then turns you into a storyteller\u2019. To travel the world is a privilege.\
  \ It unlocks new experiences and opportunities, teaches us far beyond what is learned\
  \ in a classroom, and it forces us to grow. Oftentimes it\u2019s an exciting highlight\
  \ reel of curiosities and realisations, stunning locales and beautiful new friends.\
  \ In a difficult light however it serves an honest truth; a string of incredibly\
  \ raw visuals that undoubtedly demonstrate the disconnect and disparity of our world.\
  \ Travel forces our eyes wide open, it ignites our senses and if we let it, it brings\
  \ out the best in us. It teaches us to connect and accept, no matter our roots,\
  \ and it reiterates the most basic responsibility of the human race. To turn up\
  \ for each other and to do better.\n\nPreviously in Buenos Aires, I posted an excerpt\
  \ of a bigger issue to social media about a man named Diego. It stemmed from a frequently\
  \ asked question:\n_\n\nMany people ask us \u2018what is the best thing about travelling?\u2019\
  \ Every time, it\u2019s the people and their stories. Where they come from, the\
  \ occurrences of their everyday, and what life offers in their shoes.\n.\nThis is\
  \ Diego. Or between broken language, his many missing teeth and gummy grin, it\u2019\
  s my interpretation of his name.\_\n.\nIn a bustling La Boca, a colourful barrio\
  \ that stems a rich history, and unless better understood it\u2019s non-other than\
  \ a tourist trap of bright facades, souvenir shops and street performances; Diego\
  \ sat silently offering his goods. His manner showed signs he was unwell and had\
  \ endured a tough life.\n.\nIn the mass of people surrounding, there were tourists\
  \ with their many long-lensed cameras, shiny shoes and purses of seemingly endless\
  \ cash, street vendors with beautiful stalls who would pull you in, and then, Diego.\
  \ Just there, probably unattractive to most, without any interest from the public,\
  \ offering what were clearly second-hand goods from 2015 and prior. Bless him.\_\
  \n.\nThis isn\u2019t the first time in my life I\u2019ve noticed disparity. We know\
  \ you don\u2019t need to leave home to see otherwise, but the streets of the many\
  \ countries outside Australia absolutely demonstrate the struggle for survival.\
  \ It\u2019s a harsh reality check to how lucky and privileged the majority of us\
  \ are. Even if it\u2019s no more than clean water, a roof, an education and love.\
  \ It\u2019s all we need and far beyond what others have.\n.\nMy question is, how\
  \ did we let this get so bad? When did society become \u2018above\u2019 others to\
  \ afford all that it has, to leave others with so little? And importantly, how do\
  \ we fix this?\_\n.\nAnd so, we bought a magnet from Diego, it\u2019s battered and\
  \ broken, but it has a story. Our small offering is unquestionably not going to\
  \ change his world, but it made him smile, he was incredibly gracious and that\u2019\
  s a start.\n_\n\nThe post received more engagement than anticipated, and it initiated\
  \ the discussion that I had hoped for\u2026 \n\nHowever, in a busy La Boca and many\
  \ other corners of the world, it\u2019s easy to look past people like Diego and\
  \ reassure yourself that he, and others like him are not our problem. To brush them\
  \ off and wrongly assume comfort in believing \u2018there are systems in place to\
  \ help\u2019. \n\nPoverty, homelessness and the displacement of society is all of\
  \ our problems. One that mankind created and we contribute to, every damn day when\
  \ we don\u2019t slow down, notice them and offer the smallest token of kindness.\
  \ A smile, a sandwich, a dollar, a conversation. Because with that, there is hope,\
  \ which stems change for a better place. For them, and all of us. \n\nWholeheartedly,\
  \ the best thing about travelling is the people and the impressionable connections.\
  \ A fleeting moment, a lasting friendship; the standing together in a single moment\
  \ in a place that brought us together. The locals and their stories, which become\
  \ our stories. The people like Diego who turn up everyday to share beautiful keepsakes\
  \ of our travels. \n\nPerhaps misunderstood by many, though his sincerity and prolonged\
  \ touch has a permanent effect on me."
