Text: "\u201CWhere are you from?\u201D We were sitting in the shade behind the Spanish\
  \ pavilion \u2013 that\u2019s where the charging stations were \u2013 when I asked\
  \ that question all travelers ask each other when we meet on the road. Or in this\
  \ case, on a patch of fake grass at the 2015 World Expo in Milan. Chen* told me\
  \ he was from Taiwan. I didn\u2019t recall seeing a Taiwanese pavilion on my map\
  \ of the Expo. \n\n\u201CThat\u2019s because there is no Taiwanese pavilion,\u201D\
  \ he said. \n\nI\u2019d spent all day wandering from point to point on that map,\
  \ marveling at the glorious display of architecture, culture, history, art, and,\
  \ yes, food. Food was the highlight of every pavilion. After all, Expo Milano\u2019\
  s theme was \u201CFeeding the Planet, Energy for Life.\u201D Over 140 countries\
  \ registered for the Expo, attempting to answer the question: \u201CHow will we\
  \ feed the growing global population?\u201D Taiwan was not one of those countries.\
  \ Chen explained why. \n\n\u201CWe were so excited when we got the invitation to\
  \ be part of the Expo,\u201D he said, \u201CWe wanted the world to know about Taiwan.\
  \ We wanted to share our culture, our food, our ideas!\u201D But the invitation\
  \ came with a stipulation: Taiwan couldn\u2019t have a country pavilion, only a\
  \ corporate pavilion. The Italian government didn\u2019t say why, but everyone knew.\
  \ \n\nChina.\n\nThanks to Chinese interference, Taiwan has only participated in\
  \ one World Expo since 1970: the 2010 Shanghai Expo. The invitation to participate\
  \ wasn\u2019t the diplomatic olive branch it appeared, though. China listed Taiwan\
  \ among the Chinese territories on the official Shanghai Expo website and placed\
  \ the Taiwanese pavilion between Hong Kong and Macau, further pushing their \u201C\
  one China\u201D narrative. While less serious than the threats of military violence\
  \ Taiwan has endured from China, this insult to their sovereignty made on the global\
  \ stage was not the simple misunderstanding China claimed. Five years later, Taiwan\
  \ refused to be slighted again at the Milan Expo.\n \n\u201COur government turned\
  \ down the offer because Taiwan is not a corporation,\u201D Chen continued. \u201C\
  We are a sovereign country. The Ministry would rather Taiwan have no pavilion than\
  \ be insulted.\u201D\n\n In his place, I think I would have boycotted the Expo.\
  \ \n\n \u201CBut you\u2019re here,\u201D I said. \u201CWhy?\u201D \n\n\u201CBecause\
  \ if I\u2019m here, then Taiwan is here,\u201D he responded. \u201CSo, we don\u2019\
  t have a pavilion. Fine. I will be the pavilion.\u201D\n\nLater I would learn that\
  \ there was a Taiwanese pavilion in Milan, just not at the Expo. A group of volunteers\
  \ got permission from the city to build one in the Piazza del Duomo. For the six\
  \ months that the Expo ran, they worked out of their tiny pavilion, sharing recipes,\
  \ food, and history with passersby. Their traditional dress \u2013 in the green,\
  \ white, and red of Italy\u2019s flag \u2013 marked the volunteers as ambassadors\
  \ of Taiwan.\n\nI didn\u2019t visit that pavilion, though, and the ambassador I\
  \ met was just wearing jeans and a white T-shirt. Chen didn\u2019t have stacks of\
  \ pamphlets in his backpack or a memorized speech or a name-tag. But he did have\
  \ a phone charger, which he let me borrow. We sat cross-legged in our invisible\
  \ pavilion, the fake grass prickling against our calves, and he told me about his\
  \ home. No official building could have represented the dignity and resilience of\
  \ the Taiwanese people better. \n\nWhen I think back to my whirlwind day at the\
  \ 2015 World Expo, I think of the hundreds of photographs I took: the henna tattooed\
  \ on the back of my hand in the Qatar pavilion; the hanging herbs in the French\
  \ pavilion; the kimchi rolled up into a decorative rosette at the Korean pavilion\u2019\
  s restaurant. Each instant is immortalized, a bunch of pixels on my hard drive;\
  \ an easy crutch for memory; a highway for the colors, sounds, and smells to come\
  \ flooding back. Yet four years later, this is what I remember best: this quiet,\
  \ unphotographed moment. \n\nNext year, Dubai is hosting the World Expo. Once again,\
  \ Taiwan will not be in attendance. At least, not on paper. I have no doubt, though,\
  \ that Taiwan\u2019s ambassadors, will show up.  \n\n*Chen\u2019s name has been\
  \ changed to protect his identity."
