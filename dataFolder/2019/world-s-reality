Text: "It all started with that beautiful feeling of adventure and get more knowledge\
  \ about the planet that we live on.\nWas a perfect scenery, we had money saved,\
  \ we where a happy couple and the flight tickets where quite cheap, so, \nWhere\
  \ to go? Somewhere hot with beautiful nature and miles to discover.\nLooking at\
  \ the Mapa Mundi, it looked good to travel from the fronteer of Venezuela with Colombia,\
  \ until the fronteer with Panama with Colombia. Of course we did not think much\
  \ about fronteer issues, politics, rainy seasons, drug traffic, roads, details.\n\
  \nHere we go, 3 month for an adventure that was about to tell us how the world works\
  \ nowadays.\n\nPersonally, I have been traveling a lot, so I was pretty confident\
  \ about this new rode to ride. But life will always show her new faces.\n\nFirst\
  \ stop, Santa Marta, Colombia, get a bus, a truck and a ute 4x4 to make it to the\
  \ fronteer with Venezuela, beautiful massive dessert with unknow beaches and one\
  \ of the most ancient cultures still alive, then we started realizing the reality\
  \ of this people that has been oppressed by capitalism, drug traffic and the plastic\
  \ Era, they where trying to keep it clean, but turism wasnt doing a big favor. So\
  \ we kept our journey, and every beach we visited was worst than the one before,\
  \ what are humans doing to our planet we asked our selves so many times.\nWe had\
  \ that hope, that when we get to the fronteer with Panama, everything was going\
  \ to be different, not many people knew about that place, it was difficult to get\
  \ there, take 2 buses and 2 boats to get to that paradise, we where traveling in\
  \ low season, so good deals, but the weather and the mosquitoes where doing their\
  \ things. 3mts waves, seasick and backpains. Until we make it there after 2 month\
  \ traveling thru Colombia's reality, deep cruel reality. We felt good, beautiful\
  \ hikes, pure nature and lovely beaches, but it wasn't real paradise, plastic on\
  \ the shores, boat containers washed out siting on these white sand beaches. We\
  \ still had some hope, let's go diving, the water looks clean, but there you see,\
  \ dead corals everywhere...\nWe where not searching for paradise, just lookin to\
  \ share some time in nature, but even that is difficult now. Where to go next?"
