Text: "I remember the first time I saw a picture of Colombia\u2019s breathtaking mountains.\
  \ Somehow, in that moment, I knew that Colombia would be the next place I found\
  \ myself. I sat in my living room repeatedly clicking the down arrow, scrolling\
  \ through photo after photo. Butterflies fluttered in my stomach as I imagined what\
  \ it would be like to see these places in real life. My dad\u2019s and sister\u2019\
  s eyes were glued to the television screen; Mine were glued to a country I could\
  \ hear calling my name through my laptop. In May of 2016, I made it happen. Despite\
  \ the many looks of disbelief, the \u2018Are you sure?\u2019s, and the \u2018Please\
  \ be careful\u2019s, I made it happen. My best friend and I took off for a 10-day\
  \ trip to a country exploding with beauty, the same country that 26 years after\
  \ its dark past, still does not get a fair chance in the game. \n\nTwo years later\
  \ I was again, deboarding the cold JetBlue plane into the Equator heat, this time\
  \ not with my best friend, but with my Osprey backpack (arguably my other best friend).\
  \ This summer I was challenging myself to experience what it would it be like to\
  \ just be...and to do it alone. There was something about the Cartagena heat that\
  \ lit me up inside. I felt my smile grow across my instantly sweaty face. I\u2019\
  m here. \n\nOn the fifth day of my journey I woke up with a heaviness, dragging\
  \ my feet my entire way to the airport. One last stop for an arepa with eggs and\
  \ cheese, before I found myself sitting in the emergency exit row of an Avianca\
  \ plane. The flight attendants walked the aisles, their smiles complete with red\
  \ lipstick stretching across their faces. They were nice. I couldn\u2019t help but\
  \ wonder if the people of Medell\xEDn would be nice too.  \n\nThere were so many\
  \ reasons why I came to love Cartagena\u2014it was familiar; Medell\xEDn was not.\
  \ I knew how the coste\xF1as spoke, I knew the plazas, where to go, where not to\
  \ go...As my eyes were getting heavier by the second, I wondered if maybe I should\u2019\
  ve just stayed where I was comfortable. My stomach fluttered again but this time,\
  \ it wasn\u2019t with excitement. As we lifted off the ground, I forced myself to\
  \ drift off into a dream about Cartagena once more. \n\nMedell\xEDn\u2019s energy\
  \ was a shock to my system. Unlike any other place I\u2019d ever seen, the valley\
  \ that cradles the city of Medell\xEDn contains more life than I could have ever\
  \ let my mind fathom before being there. For one week, I was entirely captivated\
  \ by what Medell\xEDn had to offer my unexpecting mind. Here was a city that didn\u2019\
  t have a minute in time to spend on anything other than being awake. Awake is how\
  \ Medell\xEDn made me feel.  \n\nThe view of the city from the cable car left me\
  \ with no words. The lights, the voices, and the movement below me never lost life\
  \ through the late-night hours and into the next day. My heart was as full as my\
  \ stomach. The street vendors fed me well in those late hours, even in the pouring\
  \ rain; Chorizo and choclo were plentiful, as were my choices in getting around\
  \ the city. The light rail swiftly took me here and there. I wandered between the\
  \ solar paneled buildings of downtown and into several museums that offered me understanding\
  \ of the history of a city I realized I knew very little about. The street art was\
  \ never scarce and told vibrant stories of the calles of Medell\xEDn. Parque Lleras\
  \ showed me that paisas knew how to party. It also proved true that even though\
  \ I was 23, I wasn\u2019t too old to jump in a ball pit and to have an exhilarating\
  \ time doing it. Who knew? Every morning, I woke up with the sun and with the voice\
  \ of the man with a megaphone who persistently tried to sell breads to whoever would\
  \ listen. I was listening. Every day, I listened to what that city had to share\
  \ with me, and it had so much to give."
