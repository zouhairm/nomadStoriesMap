Text: "During the final days that I spent by myself in Rome, an acute sense of melancholy\
  \ inhabited my being. At first, I thought it was just the expected sadness - the\
  \ dawning realization that I was nearing the end of my month-long journey through\
  \ Europe. But the more I thought about it, the more I felt that the sadness had\
  \ come from outside myself, and that the stone towering above and holding firm beneath\
  \ my feet had placed a small, heavy wisdom on my soul.\n   Everyone who has heard\
  \ of Rome knows that the city is steeped in anthropological richness: art, architecture,\
  \ and divinity have always had permanent residency, and I travelled there to see\
  \ if I could appreciate these things to the utmost degree. I strode alongside high\
  \ garden walls that bespoke old aristocracy. I allowed myself to stand and watch\
  \ sunlight sprawl across grand staircases leading to even grander structures. I\
  \ let the chapels with stained glass masterpieces rekindle a childhood fascination\
  \ with magic. I drank at the ornate fountains providing my lifeblood in June's sweltering\
  \ heat. I added my own sweat to the winding cobblestone streets only to discover\
  \ that while Rome is rich in written history, the city is even more so utterly soaked\
  \ in memory. This discerning feeling dawned on me, that every new sensation I had\
  \ taken in - every new axiom of wonder, every fresh step I took where I had not\
  \ stepped before - had likely been perceived, awed, and stepped by thousands of\
  \ other someones before me. It was as though some entity of stone, sweat, and time\
  \ had added a brick to my backpack. Perhaps as some kind of routine cleanse, Rome\
  \ has to impart these bits of wisdom, these memories, onto unsuspecting travellers\
  \ - lest it collapse under the weight of its own experience. Or perhaps, just the\
  \ opposite: for every puny human realization that occurs underneath some stunning\
  \ fresco, Rome rejuvenates itself and cultivates its permanence in a world that\
  \ is becoming more frenetically transient all the time. \n    I wondered: was there\
  \ anything the city had not been witness to? Was it more than just an inanimate\
  \ observer? Had Rome had been involuntarily selected as a stage for, and a purveyor\
  \ of, the wide spectrum of humanity\u2019s experience? I balked at the thought:\
  \ without ever having moved, the city had seen more of humanity than one person\
  \ could hope to see in a hundred countries or a thousand lifetimes - and I was envious.\
  \ Suddenly, I was dissatisfied with my own travel experience. I could not help but\
  \ isolate myself by personifying the city, and I felt strange and small with the\
  \ revelation Rome had imparted to me. \n    Unpacking my bags only took the length\
  \ of an afternoon. As I reluctantly returned to my job, my subconscious continued\
  \ to unpack everything else. When I was somewhat readjusted to the 9-5, I thought\
  \ about the smallness I had felt in a place that was supposed to only instil awe\
  \ and wonder, and I realized that my loneliness had given way to something else!\
  \ A quiet, humble bump in my mind: a oneness, a wholeness of sorts. I understood\
  \ that if I had subtracted everything I expected Rome to be and instead simply went\
  \ to receive, the spirit of the place would become apparent before anything else.\
  \ Perhaps by shedding preconceived notions of a place that can easily be personified,\
  \ I could have avoided the dread and gone right to the bliss of feeling interlaced\
  \ with the rest of humanity. So, I aim to always be a traveller, to sympathize with\
  \ these poor cities who are forever doomed to watch humanity unfold within them.\
  \ Unless I continue to go and be humbled by stone and interpret what the city has\
  \ seen, the cities will become jaded and grumpy and uninformative to those people\
  \ who do not have the luxury of leaving."
