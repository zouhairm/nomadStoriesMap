Text: "Every time I hear Joni Mitchell\u2019s voice, I\u2019m transported to the back\
  \ seat of our hideous hire car, mind drifting as I gaze out the window, watching\
  \ California\u2019s Highway Number One roll by. I am looking up, almost always looking\
  \ up at the huge craggy mountains, the giant sequoias or the deep, winding ravines.\
  \ Drinking in the strangeness of it all; roads that went on forever dotted with\
  \ bizarre little roadside motels and restaurants that served gigantic portions of\
  \ food on paper plates with plastic cutlery. \n\nMy parents had planned a round\
  \ trip flying into and out of San Francisco. They had worked there before and knew\
  \ we\u2019d love it; I\u2019d never seen so much energy in a city, so much life.\
  \ From San Francisco we did a 1000 mile circuit, taking in Yosemite, Kings Canyon,\
  \ Sequoia National Park then out to the coast returning on Highway 1. Out of the\
  \ three weeks we spent in California, Kings Canyon left the biggest impression and\
  \ involved several unexpected finds.\n\nThere were four standout moments in Kings\
  \ Canyon, three of which were close encounters of the bear kind. Our first run in\
  \ with a black bear caught us with our pants down, literally. We were out hiking\
  \ when my mum, my sister and I all needed a pee. My dad was our lookout, so when\
  \ he started jumping and waving we assumed some other hikers were headed our way.\
  \ We reassembled ourselves, grabbed our backpacks and scrambled back down to the\
  \ path where my dad explained that there had been a curious black bear heading right\
  \ towards our pee spot. Luckily, with all the commotion she had lumbered back into\
  \ the forest.\n\nThe next bear encounter was at a small lake, not far from the Lodge.\
  \ After a long day of walking we had stopped to have a dip. My dad and I swam to\
  \ a rock that jutted out in the middle of the lake and, after a lot of persuasion,\
  \ I leaped off into the cool clear water. Having done this a few times, we both\
  \ lay out on the top of the rock to warm up in the sun. We noticed that the beach\
  \ was deserted so we swam back to find my mum and sister. They ran up to us from\
  \ their hiding spot behind some trees to tell us that, while we\u2019d been splashing\
  \ about, a big black bear had shambled over to the waters edge for a drink. Once\
  \ again we had been lucky as the bear had been completely indifferent to us. By\
  \ this point I\u2019d had two unexpected bear encounters but was the only one left\
  \ who hadn\u2019t actually seen one. However, on the way back, I was surprised and\
  \ overjoyed to find a bear crossing the road. We had to stop the car to let him\
  \ pass. It was magnificent! I finally got to see a black bear up close and from\
  \ the relative safety of the car. \n\nUnexpected bear encounters make for good stories\
  \ but my fondest memory came a couple of evenings later. Despite the bears, my dad\
  \ and I headed out for a night-time stroll to see the stars. There was no artificial\
  \ light near us as the lodge was 35 miles from the nearest town. This meant we only\
  \ had a short walk before there was no light pollution. Once we decided we had walked\
  \ far enough for complete darkness we turned off our torches, sat on the soft damp\
  \ grass and looked up. As my eyes adjusted, more and more stars kept appearing until\
  \ it seemed as though there was more bright white than black in the night sky. I\
  \ had never seen stars like it and I was overcome with a feeling of insignificance\
  \ and clarity. I will never forget that moment.\n\n\nCalifornia was awe-inspiring,\
  \ the vast fields of grapevines and watermelons, the giant Sequoias and the looming\
  \ gorges. It was just how it comes across in the songs, sun-soaked and full of soul,\
  \ with the occasional unexpected bear."
