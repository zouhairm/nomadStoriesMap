Text: "A trip to a new country is always exciting. A trip from -30C to +30C is a miracle.\n\
  In December 2017, my friend and I decided we would run away from Kazakhstan, its\
  \ snow and frost at least for ten days. Goa was an affordable and reachable destination.\
  \ We booked a room in a three-stars hotel, asked a tour agency for help with visas,\
  \ and in about two weeks we left our cold country.\nI had mixed expectations about\
  \ Goa. I\u2019ve seen many negative comments warning that water is polluted, mosquitos\
  \ are infectious, and people are strange. My parents were sure that Goa could be\
  \ a dangerous place. Others said that Goa is a paradise with beautiful sunsets.\
  \ It also seemed a good place to start discovering India, which always was a must-visit\
  \ country for me because I do yoga and I am a vegetarian.\nWe arrived at the airport\
  \ in the evening, so the first impression of the place was still ambiguous. A taxi\
  \ brought us to our hotel, driving along dark, unlit streets. I couldn\u2019t see\
  \ properly and only felt that the air was damp and hot, but not too much.\nThe hotel\
  \ room was spartan: white walls, a minimum of furniture with a layer of dust on\
  \ it. There was a small balcony, which was not big enough to do yoga on it, as I\
  \ imagined. I laughed hysterically, but we were so tired and decided that life would\
  \ get better in the morning.\nAnd it actually did. The sun was shining brightly\
  \ like I hadn\u2019t seen for a long time. When I went to the balcony, there was\
  \ a beautiful view of palms and the courtyard. It was unbelievable that there was\
  \ winter many kilometres away. I was happy like a child to see so much green everywhere\
  \ and to smell salt in the air. \nThe breakfast was as austere as our room, but\
  \ the dish we had for lunch, thali, was authentic, big and spicy, so hot and spicy\
  \ that I couldn\u2019t feel my tongue. Next time we asked a waiter to put fewer\
  \ spices in the dish, and he said, \u201COkay, not spicy, special for foreigners!\u201D\
  \ In the evening, we chose a cafe on the shore, and there was only one free table;\
  \ when we asked a waiter to wipe the cloth, he just turned it upside down and said,\
  \ \u201CIndian style!\u201D\nYou might get annoyed about such things on the first\
  \ day in Goa. You might feel that trash and dirt are everywhere around. You might\
  \ get angry about motorcycles, the absence of rules on the road, and the constant\
  \ noise. But you get used to the \u201CIndian style\u201D in a couple of days because\
  \ it means being calm and living today rather than worrying about unnecessary things.\
  \ I realized that when I saw the sea for the first time in my life.\nThere are many\
  \ beaches in Goa for anything you prefer: if you are a party person, you should\
  \ stay at Anjuna, if you are like flea markets, go to Arambol. During that week,\
  \ we went to yoga classes several times, visited a waterfall, went to a techno-party,\
  \ and did so many other things we would never do if we stayed at home."
