Text: "Summer 2017: The turquoise ocean, the sea winds and the golden beach basked\
  \ by sun, a scenery I never thought to witness but with the stroke of luck I was\
  \ there. I stood there and saw a life totally foreign to me, the natures combination\
  \ of gold sand being splashed by aquamarine water while glorious sun shone vehemently,\
  \ people in swim suits were laughing, sunbathing and swimming in sea while children\
  \ messing around in sand and splashing water nearby. Every detail that my eyes caught\
  \ made me wonder of how travelling offers you diversity and opportunity to discover\
  \ new side to oneself.\nSo, coming from a rather conservative Asian Muslim background,\
  \ I being female wasn\u2019t allowed to learn swimming or have any aspiration of\
  \ performing water sports. This primarily is based on the perception that \u2018\
  swimming is not for females as wet clothes dishonors their body by exposing feminine\
  \ physique\u2019 thus, never ever giving me chance to get in contact with water\
  \ bodies.\nIn Kemer that day, with my first exposure to beach I was overwhelmed\
  \ or better said over empowered I set to challenge myself. I opted to go for \u2018\
  scuba diving\u2019 with another Pakistani peer with me.\nSo, we got on to the dock,\
  \ a bit distanced from the main hustling beach, paid 90 Turkish Lira, wore that\
  \ scuba diving suit and finally we were preached by the instructor the do\u2019\
  s and dont\u2019s of the scuba venture. Listening to instructor gave me goosebumps\
  \ and with little wrong Turkish I told him that I don\u2019t know how to swim (Ben\
  \ Hayir Swim), he laughed and told me that it\u2019s okay and no need to worry about.\
  \ With this and diver communication signs, I remember I was strapped up with heavy\
  \ oxygen cylinders on my back I was in queue to go in 20 feet water. \nWell the\
  \ instructor dropped me in water as one drops treasure chest in ocean and my reaction\
  \ was \u2018WHERE IS THE DAMN EARTH!\u2019I literally barked that \u2018I can\u2019\
  t feel the ground\u2019 and started to pant heavily which got so worse that instructor\
  \ insured me that \u2018there are no sharks underneath, you can relax\u2019. I guess\
  \ I did regain my composure, I went into the water and my heart just stopped, I\
  \ could never imagine the world like that, deep blue sea with sun rays piercing\
  \ the water to illuminate the way as we descended, I focused on breathing while\
  \ my eyes gawked at the sight and I wondered that was I in Atlanta from Disney\u2019\
  s cartoon \u2018Aerial\u2019 ? It all made sense yet this trans fantasy experience\
  \ panicked me after 15 minutes and I conveyed to instructor to take me back to the\
  \ surface. \nComing back to surface felt like entering another portal, primarily\
  \ which felt more like home; safe and cozy. With three hours of break I made sure\
  \ to dry hair and was pretty done with this astounding yet startling experience\
  \ for someone like me. Later on, instructors mentioned that now we would go for\
  \ 80 feet scuba diving and I could feel my heart pounding again. But I didn\u2019\
  t refuse my slot and again got ready for the dive. This time peer told me that \u2018\
  consider this your last opportunity ever for scuba diving and enjoy it as one\u2019\
  , this hit me hard. While going underneath I kept these words in mind and viewed\
  \ the marine life from a deeper and philosophical perception. It was all water with\
  \ shade varying from light blue to black, the coral reefs brought vibrant color\
  \ in majestic environment, the fishes of varying sizes and colors showed the busy\
  \ underground lifestyle which we humans were interfering felt like coming to Nemo\u2019\
  s world. In this dive my soul was the one who saw the wonders of nature with such\
  \ awe and eagerness.\nWith sunset around the corner and ending this venture got\
  \ me wondering that how blessed I was to witness this side of nature. I broke the\
  \ stereotypes that hamper my capability and allowed myself to discover the world\
  \ through my own spectrum. I felt empowered and more connected to myself than ever\
  \ and I surely got good share of stories to tell my grandchildren about."
