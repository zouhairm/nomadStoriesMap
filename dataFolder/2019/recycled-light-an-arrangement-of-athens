Text: "Airports, Plane, trains, boats and buses. This time its island hopping in Greece!\
  \ \nNew cities, hopeful as the start, still require courage. Myth, magic, might,\
  \ and Me! First, Athens. Named after Athena \u2013 the goddess of wisdom. There\
  \ is legend in this naming. Poseidon, god of the sea and Athena rivaled for this\
  \ challenge. Poseidon struck a rock and produced a salty spring. Athena produced\
  \ an olive tree. The olive tree being fundamental to the livelihood and trade of\
  \ Athens, won favor for this Goddess.\n\nAthens was the ancient cultural hub of\
  \ artist, poets, sculptors and warriors. A birthplace of philosophy and politics.\
  \ Alas, modern day Athens has no Gods dueling battle in the sky, philosopher kings\
  \ or heroes of yesteryear. I stare at dingy streets marked with graffiti and buildings,\
  \ stained with pollution. If only they were still passionate about the olive tree.\n\
  I wander around ancient grounds and dirty streets. Poverty is apparent in Greece.\
  \ The economic crisis has left this a hardened place.\nToday I have a guide. Vicki\
  \ -The patient. She says, \u201Chow do you find Athens?\u201D. I reply with woes\
  \ of disappointment. \nI tell her the food is drowned in oil and honey and I can\u2019\
  t find the beautiful warrior race in these faces, nor the art and enlightenment\
  \ that I thought would have filtered through the ages.\nShe says, \u201CWhat would\
  \ you like to eat?\u201D. Some seafood please.\nWe take a long walk. I stop, a little\
  \ stunned. In an idle street tucked between other less interesting tiny shops, unexpectedly\
  \ is a salami maker. The size of a supermarket. I am fascinated! Hanging from the\
  \ ceiling is an abundance and variety of salami.\nA few blocks further, is a cobbler\
  \ who specializes in traditional Greek sandals that was even used in Broadway productions.\
  \ \nI find myself taking a ton of pictures. My curiosity seems to be awakened.\n\
  It\u2019s a strange city. To a foreigner the streets are quiet, deserted and dirty.\
  \ No cosmopolitan glamour here.\nI stumble across a brightly placed tea room. My\
  \ sight has to adjust to take in the vision in front of me. There are ladies conversing,\
  \ dressed in bright \u201CAlice in wonderland\u201D kind of frocks. A gilded carriage\
  \ is outside and candy-striped curtains at the windows. \u201CLittle Kook\u201D\
  \ looks like a ton of fun. Vicki says, \u201Ccome along \u2013 you wanted sea food\u201D\
  . \nJust a bit further. O my, what an eclectic street we come to. In between the\
  \ buildings, discarded light fittings and shades have been strung, \u201CRecycled\
  \ light\u201D.\nWe proceed on our path.\nStill this distasteful graffiti. I ponder\
  \ on the notion of damaging buildings with this obscenity. \nDisturbed, I mention\
  \ this to Vicki.\n\nShe tells me about a revolution that has sprung in the city.\n\
  It has begun as a response to the economic crisis.\nThis building, which has a dog\
  \ sprayed onto it, is against the government who were planning to close down the\
  \ oldest theatre in Athens. The artists decided to express their response. \n\n\
  There it has been! All along in my face, it has been staring me in the face. In\
  \ challenge of my expectations, discomforting, confrontational, but nonetheless\
  \ clear in expression. There was the warrior spirit! There was the art! There, was\
  \ the politics, philosophy and enlightenment. What is will always be and will always\
  \ come around again. It was not latent or dead. It was Art. I could not see it initially.\
  \ I had turned away from it. It was real. I needed context.\nGraffiti provokes a\
  \ feeling of distastefulness, stemming from the illicitness and aggression it carries.\
  \ What is Art. It has been said that art\u201D should comfort the disturbed and\
  \ disturb the comfortable\u201D. It is an expression, a language, a story, an awakening\
  \ of the spirit. Its use is more than decoration. It has purpose in individual and\
  \ collective expression. It provides a voice.\nHere is an entire city dedicated\
  \ to the ideals of what Greece represented. The artists, poets, writers, philosophers,\
  \ warriors and masons were not dead or latent. They were very much alive, in modern\
  \ Athens. The spirit of Greece had transcended time and translated herself. It had\
  \ made its way through, after all."
