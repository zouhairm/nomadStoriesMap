Text: "Munnar is beautiful beyond words. There is much more to Munnar which meets\
  \ the eye. People visiting Munnar stick to hotspots or often follow the guide\u2019\
  s instructions. The journey is more enjoyable due to vivid sceneries, lush green\
  \ forest and it does get cold on the way to the top. Travelling for almost 4 hours,\
  \ I finally reached Munnar at 4.00 in the evening; I could actually notice tea selling\
  \ shops. They serve tea in a huge glass almost like a milkshake, price may differ\
  \ from one shop to another i.e. (10-15 rupees) but the quantity is almost the same.\
  \ The town is crowded and obviously commercial, filled with hotels, motels, shopping\
  \ districts. However Munnar is also special for home stays which cuts you off from\
  \ the regular routine and takes you deep into the jungle and Tea estates which have\
  \ been hardly explored. Home stays also have pick up and drop facilities but it\
  \ is chargeable. However the first pick up and the last drop does not come under\
  \ the payable category. The stay is peaceful and beautiful since it is surrounded\
  \ by greenery and small river streams.\n\n Echo point, tea museum, flower garden\
  \ and Eravikulam Park are the major hotspots but Munnar has much more to offer than\
  \ these usual places.\n\nThe caretaker of the home stay, Tony picked me up from\
  \ the bus stop and drove me to the room, on the way it was really difficult for\
  \ tony to drive because of the thick mist which blurred his vision. We couldn\u2019\
  t see anything ahead up to 10 meters. I enjoyed being covered in nature\u2019s arm.\
  \ There were several children waving at me and it really felt heartwarming and welcoming.\
  \ As soon as I reached the room I had a hot water shower and took a power nap, woke\
  \ up at 5.30 in the evening! Tony had a surprise waiting for me and asked me to\
  \ get ready and he drove me to a small auditorium.\n\nThe first thing I noticed\
  \ was that the stage was not at the center and it also had a muddy ground suitable\
  \ for Kabaddi which added to my surprise.   Kathakali is a known dance form around\
  \ the the world but many don't know that it is also the home of kalaripayattu. It\
  \ is a martial art which originated as a combat technique in Kerala.\n\nKalari basically\
  \ means battlefield or combat arena. The weapons used in this form of combat are\
  \ spear, shield, machetes, tridents and swords of all types. The elite warriors\
  \ of the Sangam period or dynasty dating back to 2nd century B.C are known for this\
  \ combative techniques used in the warfare. It is still practiced in Kerala and\
  \ many parts of the country. Well it really was breathtaking and a feast to the\
  \ eyes. I could watch both the shows kathakali and kalaripayattu for just 400 rupees.\
  \ The performing artists were humble and obliged for a few photographs.  I felt\
  \ privileged to have watched their irrefutable talent live. This also gave me Goosebumps\
  \ since the weapons used in the show were real and super sharp. I thanked tony for\
  \ this great experience. We drove and packed some food on our way back.\n\nNext\
  \ on my list was a beautiful waterfall fondly known as Lakkom which was about 23\
  \ kilometers from Carmelagiri. Tony helped me rent a bike for 300 INR which came\
  \ as a surprise since tourist could only hire an auto, jeep or a taxi. This is because\
  \ the labor unions have an understanding with the local people, which prevents them\
  \ from providing bikes on rent. This seemed reasonable because their business and\
  \ livelihood would be hurt. I was indeed lucky to get the bike and was all alone,\
  \ it was the ultimate freedom. Riding a bike in the Western Ghats is all together\
  \ a whole new experience.\nMany of us go far away seeking solace and it also depends\
  \ on what one finds solace in, maybe sometimes all we need is to take a break and\
  \ do things that we are fond of and that will bring to happiness into our lives\n\
  \nThe true intent of a traveler is not to arrive anywhere. It is the ultimate freedom.\
  \ My journey has just begun but every boundary; every border I cross leaving my\
  \ footprints on the map seems like a good way to go!"
