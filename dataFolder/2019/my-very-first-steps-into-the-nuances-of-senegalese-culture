Text: "Dear All,\n\nWhat\u2019s cooking at your end? Hope you\u2019re enjoying the\
  \ cool breeze of autumn.I am boiling here in West Africa! I went crazy ethnic. It\u2019\
  s my third week in Senegal and it feels like am settled. Time flies! I don\u2019\
  t know where to start\u2026\n\nFirst of all, the flight- I took a plane from London,\
  \ via Milan, to Dakar. 7 hours, 3 airports, Alitalia airlines (read: chaos and relaxation).\
  \ Obviously the most annoying thing happened- lost baggage! It\xB4s probably my\
  \ own fault. I changed planes too fast and my luggage couldn\u2019t keep up with\
  \ me. Get this- Senegalese airport at midnight, about 40 degrees in my jeans and\
  \ probably 100 in my boots, no luggage and a crowd of taxi drivers offering their\
  \ pushy services in Wolof, a language which sounds like nothing I\xB4ve ever heard.\
  \ I decided to bribe a policeman with xalis (money) to call my hotel and check what\
  \ happened to my pre-booked shuttle transfer. This was my first time bribing an\
  \ official- 2 bucks used for a good cause. Then again, would you consider it a bribe\
  \ if the person in question actually asked for it? \n\nI managed to reach the hotel\
  \ called \u201CVia Via\u201D (sic!) in Yoff, a tiny village near the airport. A\
  \ small cosy bunch of rooms surrounded by a tiny garden with palm trees and hammocks\
  \ for the tired travellers. If you could see the colours everywhere! People say\
  \ Americans are attached to their stars and stripes but this is just amazing! Even\
  \ the walls and stones are painted in the colours of the Senegalese flag. I\u2019\
  m surrounded by colours- the houses, the dresses, the food.\n\nI\xB4m tough- try\
  \ sticking (literally) around in jeans, boots, and the same T-shirt in boiling heat.\
  \ Just so you know- night-time is not light-time despite the (non)cooling electric\
  \ fan hanging dangerously above your head. I decided to play the part. The \xB4\
  lost in Senegal\xB4 European went to lodge a formal complaint to Alitalia and guess\
  \ what? Madam Zelda gave me 50,000 CFA for the inconveniences like lacking clean\
  \ clothes, towels, soap, you name it. This generosity paid dividends in happiness\
  \ on both sides and a hotel room for 2 nights after which my beloved suitcase arrived.\
  \ I moved to the city centre to Hotel Continental. Don\xB4t let the name mislead\
  \ you- it was as continental as English breakfast these days! I got acquainted with\
  \ my fellow room mates- some big fat cockroaches. There were constant water cuts.\
  \ \n\nStill, truth is I\u2019m trying to experience Senegal as a whole, which is\
  \ arduous but mesmerising. It stays in your memory for life. No wonder they say\
  \ that once you\xB4ve been to Africa you will be forever longing for it. Every little\
  \ thing is meaningful and each adventure memorable. For example, last weekend I\
  \ set off in a local bus called the \xB4driving coffin\xB4 to visit Lac Rose (pink\
  \ lake) and check for myself if it\u2019s really pink. The colour was a bit disappointing\
  \ at first. It was just too early, even thou it was the beginning of the season\
  \ for pinkiness (dry season, November-July). Nevertheless, the very phenomenon of\
  \ a lake as salty as the Dead Sea was worth it. I saw the salty village with its\
  \ inhabitants and a salt collector took me in his boat to the middle of the lake\
  \ so I could admire the dunes and the finish line of the ex Paris-Dakar rally. I\
  \ also had a dip in the salty waters. People say it\u2019s like a spa for your skin-\
  \ very true. \n\nIs it the right time for lunch? Today I\xB4ll have bouye or baobab\
  \ juice- interesting taste, specially developed for the purpose of optimal thirst\
  \ quenching, and yassa poulet- basically chicken in onions fried just like my granddad\
  \ used to make it! I also recommend Thieboudienne- delicious fish with rice. \n\
  I bet you have enough and got hungry- bon appetit!"
