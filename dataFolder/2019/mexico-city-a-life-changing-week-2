Text: "In 2015, I was making work for what would be the third year of a street photography\
  \ project I was creating with a colleague. In the two previous years, we had travelled\
  \ to London and New York City making work - cities where the culture was mostly\
  \ familiar to us. For year three, we wanted to travel somewhere we would be less\
  \ comfortable, somewhere we could engage with a culture we knew little about. We\
  \ wanted to immerse ourselves somewhere we would have to be creative generally,\
  \ and in terms of communicating, as neither of us speaks Spanish. \n\nMexico City\
  \ was built upon the ruins of an Aztec city located on an island in the centre of\
  \ an ancient lake. It is not an exaggeration to note one is literally walking on\
  \ history in Mexico city, sometimes known as DF (Distrito Federal). Some of that\
  \ history is being revealed through excavations, one of which, Templo Mayor is located\
  \ in the Zocalo, or il centro, about half a kilometre from the Palacio Nacional\
  \ located on the site of the ancient Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. \n\nAs a traveller\
  \ from a young city in western Canada, where the oldest building was built most\
  \ 150 years ago, and where there is a certain order and relative quiet, stepping\
  \ out of the airport and taking a taxi to our hotel was an unforgettable experience.\
  \ On our arrival at our hotel, after the seven-kilometre, bumper-to-bumper, horns\
  \ blaring drive from the airport, we stood there, gaping at each other; if that\
  \ short ride was that intense how much more so the week?\n\nThe city is crowded\
  \ and noisy. It can be hot, smoky, and stinky. The scents of street food, the pungent,\
  \ airborn oils of two-block-long cheese and meat markets, and the wafting burnt-sugar\
  \ smell from corner churros carts dance with the air pollution from 40 million people\
  \ and their cars, all settling into the basin into which the city is crammed. \n\
  \nThe streets are always busy and people spend much more time outside than they\
  \ do where we live (it's cold here six months of the year). The endless, musical\
  \ white-noise of voices and conversations, dominates the space. This effect is much\
  \ heightened by not understanding the language; not knowing the words forces one\
  \ to hear the cadence, ebb and flow of speech of people eating with and talking\
  \ to strangers at the counters of ubiquitous taquerias lining the streets. I was\
  \ struck by how generally happy and contented people are in that huge, crowded city.\
  \ \n\nAt some point during the week, I had a conversation with the manager of a\
  \ restaurant we ate at. In order to gain some context for the images I was shooting,\
  \ I wanted to understand day-to-day life. I was struck into silence when he explained\
  \ a good - a really good - monthly salary is equivalent to about $250 USD, about\
  \ $300 in my country's currency. \n\nIn that instance, I understood deeply how monetary\
  \ wealth is not true wealth and that one's happiness cannot be based on such a fleeting\
  \ standard. This moment caused an intense shift in my perspective about how I live\
  \ in the world generally; it earthquaked my understanding of success and value and\
  \ wealth. That moment has never left me and continues to impact my life on the day-to-day\
  \ in a big, oil-rich city, where many are rich with coins in the bank; but  impoverished\
  \ by loneliness and starving to catch up to some manufactured ideal of success.\
  \ \n\nDoubtless people have similar experiences in other places, but Mexico City\
  \ was my Alamo. I travel quite often, but Mexico City is the only place I have left\
  \ in tears, with the regret of not having more time to let the truth of that ancient,\
  \ intense culture and the lives of those millions settle more deeply on my soul."
