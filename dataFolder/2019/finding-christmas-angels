Text: "As the ageing stagecoach trundled away from me, so filled with Christmas travellers\
  \ that their cheeks pressed up against the window glass, I knew I had to develop\
  \ a plan quickly. The sun had yet to rise in Calama, an impoverished mining town\
  \ in Northern Chile, and I had just been denied entry on to the only bus to the\
  \ Bolivian border. I had arrived in Calama late the night before, and had believed\
  \ the inebriated man that stood at the ticket stall who had assured me that, even\
  \ though the bus was sold out, I could come and just hop on. \n\nI watched the bus\
  \ leave without me and the dust began to settle. Where there had been a cacophony\
  \ of noise just minutes before, it was now silent, apart from distressed, broken\
  \ Spanish of a young woman not so far away. I looked up the road and could see the\
  \ girl arguing with a taxi driver. I walked over and introduced myself, understanding\
  \ we were in a similar situation. She was Brazilian. Her face was covered in mosquito\
  \ bites, but that couldn\u2019t cover her look of fear. We were both panicking,\
  \ and suddenly I felt a responsibility to get both of us wherever we needed to go.\
  \ \n \nA mistranslation got us into the car of the man she was arguing with. I had\
  \ understood that he could take us to some different busses closer to the Bolivian\
  \ border. He drove us two hours and left us in a town made of ramshackle buildings\
  \ along a mud track. 20 minutes later, the bus we had been unable to get on in the\
  \ early hours of the morning drove passed. There would be no new, different busses,\
  \ just a second chance to try the bus from that morning again. My Spanish had let\
  \ me down. We put out our thumbs, but the bus didn\u2019t slow. That was it. We\
  \ were now further away from civilisation, further away from options to help ourselves.\
  \ \n\nIt was then I learnt my new friend had only brazilian reales for money. No\
  \ chilean pesos, no dollars, no bank card. If I was stuck, she had no hope. Us two,\
  \ unable to communicate properly, were no sat by the roadside with our heads in\
  \ our hands and nowhere to go, just two days before Christmas. I knew our best chance\
  \ was to get us back to Calama and start again, so we found a tiny mini-bus that\
  \ was heading to the city.  On that journey my Brazilian friend told me she thought\
  \ I was an angel sent to save her. I wondered where my angel was. When we got back\
  \ to Calama, I changed some money and arranged a taxi all the way to Chile-Bolivian\
  \ border. \n\nWhen we arrived I woke a border guard who was sleeping in the afternoon\
  \ heat, unused to people walking up sporadically to his post. After reassuring him\
  \ we knew what we were doing, we began the walk from Chile to Bolivia, across a\
  \ wide open stretch of desert road. As we walked, myself in flip-flops that were\
  \ rapidly disintegrating, I remembered how we were not far from the Atacama Desert,\
  \ the driest place on earth. I had only drunk half a bottle of water that day. I\
  \ had 20kg on my back, and had taken the Brazilian girl\u2019s bags in my hand.\
  \ The sun was high, and a hot wind battered my face. I was so thirsty, but my mind\
  \ took over. We were literally in a no-man's land between two countries, and I couldn\u2019\
  t see how anyone would come to help us if we got into trouble. \n\nEventually I\
  \ burst through the door of the Bolivian guardhouse. A man overheard me explaining\
  \ our story, and offered to take us all the way to Uyuni in his air-conditioned\
  \ Toyota. Finally, my angel. \n\nWe got to Uyuni late that night. I swapped the\
  \ girls brazilian reales for my last US dollars so that she had some money. She\
  \ took the first bus on to La Paz that night. She thanked me emphatically, but we\
  \ would never see each other again. \n\nIt was that Christmas that I learnt what\
  \ angels really are."
