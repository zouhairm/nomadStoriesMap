Text: "You'll find yourself bang in the middle of it, no intros, no romance. Hampi\
  \ gives you the pleasant shock of a place you\u2019ve always known, but never saw\
  \ in your life: it feels like the Eternity.\n\nLooking for crocodiles and jaguars,\
  \ we found unknown creatures gathered at sunset.\n\n\nWhen we arrived, six in the\
  \ morning, it was already hot. The ruins woke me up, they were very close.\nAll\
  \ around me was golden dust and a dense sense of untouched.\n\nI had joined a group\
  \ of Californian backpackers, all aiming to the Goan Corner. Surrounded by temples,\
  \ monkeys, holy cows, we waited for a Coracle, a bowl-shaped boat to cross the river;\
  \ a celebrity baby elephant was bathing in silver waters.\n\nOur destination was\
  \ the opposite corner of the greenest rice field we\u2019d ever seen, overlooked\
  \ by millenary palms; it was refreshing for the eyes, and for the hearts. After\
  \ renting an hammock, I had a cold shower and relaxed in the vibrant garden, sipping\
  \ banana lassie, studying the colours and sounds of the imminent Hampi night.\n\n\
  \nThen everything happened very quickly: I got absorbed in this Jurassic time, enchanted\
  \ by a\nprimordial jazz with a firm feeling of sharing something unique. I jumped\
  \ in a dream. ..Have you seen\nthat jaguar in the night? that flash in the rice\
  \ field? Was that true, or were you dreaming?\n\nIt\u2019s early in the morning,\
  \ it\u2019s hot. You're on a stranger\u2019s bike; he follows a group of bikes,\
  \ eating kilometres of uncontaminated landscape, towards the Salted Lake. Quickly\
  \ it\u2019s sunshine, heat, mist. Locals climb rocks like lynxes, you are feeling\
  \ clumsy and European, buy a frozen Kingfisher, alcohol helps, with the sun melts\
  \ your fear and makes you brave; the rock is burning under your feet, you take your\
  \ friend's hand and you two jump into the water.. dark, silver, dirty, brown waters:\
  \ up up, out of it. You are dry in a minute.\n\nBack on the road, looking for the\
  \ Juice man: mixed fruit juices for you all, he will lead to the Secret beach..\
  \ Half hour walk, this beach is different: it feels like Purgatory, an abandoned\
  \ coracle on a magnetic route towards a near waterfall, only minutes away, lianas,\
  \ a snake caresses the surface like an S. Out of it, dry in a minute. On the way\
  \ you stop for a Thali with your mates, it takes hours but you are enjoying the\
  \ bare feet under the table.\n\nRiding back the breeze makes you smile; on a hill\
  \ you see the Monkey Temple, populated and scary. The bikes through the village\
  \ are honking - Please Honk.  We stop for an \"Ayurveda massage\u201D, \u201CThey\
  \ will squeeze unnecessary thoughts away\u201D Grandad said. You enter another dream..\
  \ Hands, feet, incense; a whole body on your back: this good demon is over you,\
  \ cleaning your aura. You feel New. Ready for Sunset.\n\nYour body smells of sandal\
  \ and coconut; you wear local jewellery, dress your wrists and ankles, undress your\
  \ feet. Try your best to cover your body with colours, not to look too sexy.. But\
  \ \"Light\" and \"Hot\" are with you tonight: you got the gold of the sunshine and\
  \ the beauty of nature, and now you breathe intensely and smile loudly, it's impossible\
  \ not to shine. The rocks in the horizon are populated now, like Human Temples.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYou see? All the people there? Saying Hello to the Sun\u201D, says a\
  \ little girl. And you follow them: Shanti, Kayeri, Prema, Chinni, you follow the\
  \ masala girls, towards the 'sun show'.\n\n\nThe human beings are gathered around\
  \ Galidurugappa for the sun salutation: someone sits, someone prays, someone plays;\
  \ Gali is playing a Hapi Drum, a tuned vibrating tongue of steel which creates sound\
  \ waves. How can you feel younger, and at the same time wiser? \n\nYou sing with\
  \ the kids a song in another language, the Kannada language, it\u2019s like when\
  \ you were a kid, it doesn\u2019t really matter. You are part of the collective\
  \ surprise, a human tear in an unusual corner of the world, where the past, the\
  \ music, the sunset and the beauty all sit together.  \n\nLike when we were kids,\
  \ when we'd all smile, and no need to know why"
