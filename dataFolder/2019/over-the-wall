Text: "The night air grows cooler, but it\u2019s not the climate making me shiver.\
  \ Earlier, children ran about, laughing, in the streets, but not a soul remains.\
  \ Slivers of light break free of curtained windows, while darkness obscures bullet\
  \ holes in the walls of nearby houses. No street lights guide my way, and the looming\
  \ 8m-high concrete wall barricading Israel against the diminutive West Bank casts\
  \ an imposing shadow. I\u2019m walking back to my homestay in Aida Refugee Camp,\
  \ alone, and it\u2019s later than I had planned.\n\nI first set foot in Aida 24\
  \ hours earlier, accompanied by my host, Ahmed, whose wife, Islam, runs cooking\
  \ classes for tourists. Wanting to learn to cook and to understand the ongoing effects\
  \ of the Nakba, in which thousands of Palestinian Arabs fled their homes, I had\
  \ arranged to spend two nights with the couple, within the walls of the camp.\n\n\
  Ahmed met me at the entrance to the area, which, with its cream-coloured, concrete\
  \ houses, and sealed, if potholed, roads, surprised me in its permanence: I had\
  \ naively pictured canvas tents and impromptu paths, despite the camp being nearly\
  \ 70 years old. The night was quiet, and on the short walk to Ahmed and Islam\u2019\
  s house we made small talk; commonplace topics, in this most unusual of settings.\n\
  \nA short time later, when Islam arrived home, she unwrapped the brightly-coloured\
  \ cloth of her hijab and stepped out of the full length abaya she wore in public,\
  \ revealing trackpants and a t-shirt; an action that startled me with its vulnerability.\
  \ Having shed these layers of protection, Islam began to talk. About her family\u2019\
  s village, which she had never seen. Ahmed\u2019s arrest by the Israeli Defence\
  \ Force, which forced her to raise their children alone for four years. Their son,\
  \ Mohammed\u2019s, cerebral palsy and the challenges of accessing medical care and\
  \ education.\n\nIslam\u2019s stories, so dark and filled with trauma, seemed remote\
  \ from her bright, clean, living room, packed with children giggling, asking questions,\
  \ and clamouring over each other to tell their father about their day.\n\nNext morning,\
  \ a community volunteer gathers the day\u2019s students for a walking tour of Aida.\
  \ Graffitied resistance slogans, including the words \u2018coexist\u2019 and \u2018\
  #unoccupy\u2019 adorn cinder block walls, and a giant key \u2013 symbolic of a return\
  \ to hastily-abandoned ancestral homes \u2013 dominates the skyline. Stories of\
  \ tear gas being used against children throwing rocks, the fatal shooting of a young\
  \ boy on his balcony and, only the previous week, a woman\u2019s preventable death\
  \ from a gas-induced asthma attack, claw at our hearts.\n\nWatchtowers in the Separation\
  \ Barrier provide a constant reminder of the Israeli military\u2019s presence, but\
  \ the sky is blue, and a light breeze on our skins reassures us that, for now at\
  \ least, everyone is safe.\n\nIn Islam\u2019s kitchen, the world outside falls away\
  \ as we set about baking bread, rolling vine leaves, and stuffing spiced rice into\
  \ zucchinis. There is laughter, chatter, and the simple pleasures of cooking, and\
  \ eating, together.\n\nIn Bethlehem, after the class, hours pass in tourist oblivion,\
  \ and the sun sinks lower in the sky.\n\nThere are no soldiers in the camp when\
  \ I return. No one is in the streets at all. Yesterday, this was unextraordinary;\
  \ today, slightly menacing. I wonder what would happen if a soldier came across\
  \ me walking through the camp. Would my dark hair and eyes be enough to avoid drawing\
  \ attention? Would my inability to speak Hebrew or Arabic put me at risk? Would\
  \ my presence create danger for Islam and Ahmed, who welcomed me into their home?\
  \ The thoughts make me shiver involuntarily.\n\nI came to Aida to learn, but it\
  \ isn\u2019t until that moment alone in the street, that I finally, if fleetingly,\
  \ appreciate what it means to live in Palestine. Not knowing when soldiers will\
  \ come, or how they will react when they do; hypervigilance to potential threats;\
  \ an acute awareness that there is no way to control the future.\n\nI realise then,\
  \ that underneath the laughter, the stories, and the food, this fear haunts the\
  \ lives of all those who cannot escape.\n\nCriminal. Illegal. Queue jumper. Terrorist.\n\
  \nIf that constant state of panic was my alternative, I\u2019d be looking over the\
  \ wall too."
