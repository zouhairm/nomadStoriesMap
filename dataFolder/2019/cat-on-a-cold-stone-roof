Text: "The bookshop was small, warmly lit. Inviting. Exactly what I needed. I had\
  \ just finished a hike along the cliff tops from Fira to Oia on Santorini, timing\
  \ the trip to end up in the famously picturesque village for sunset. I was exhausted,\
  \ deeply ready to sit, and, having finished my battered copy of The Hitchhiker\u2019\
  s Guide to the Galaxy (which had lasted me from the Netherlands to Bulgaria), itching\
  \ for something new to read. \n\nI could happily plan all my travels around a search\
  \ for bookstores, and this one was a beaut: cozy, eclectic, and organized somewhat\
  \ haphazardly. I moved between the stacks, trailing my hands across the old, mostly\
  \ cracked spines. Did I want something ancient and epic, to get me in the spirit\
  \ of adventure? Or something slower, more contemplative, perfect for the moments\
  \ I\u2019d sit in some sidewalk cafe for hours, nursing an espresso while people-watching?\n\
  \nLost in thought and decisions, I stumbled as I rounded the corner past \u201C\
  Greek Classics.\u201D Curled up at the base of the shelf, on a pillow clearly reserved\
  \ for it, was a rather large cat. It looked up at the shop like a monarch surveying\
  \ his domain, half-closed eyes seeming disdainful at my clumsiness, with the judgmental\
  \ air with which cats seem to be born. I\u2019d just turned away to give it the\
  \ space it so clearly desired when a salesman strode over, surprised to see me;\
  \ the shop had emptied completely as I browsed. \u201CWhat are you doing back here?\u201D\
  \ he asked. \u201CWe\u2019re closing shortly, and you\u2019re missing the sunset.\u201D\
  \ I had known I was losing track of time, but I\u2019d so been enjoying my exploring.\
  \ I worried I\u2019d probably missed the best of the sky.\n\nHe must have seen the\
  \ disappointment in my face; he took pity on me. \u201CWe have a roof here, you\
  \ know. It\u2019s got a great view.\u201D This was perfect! I could nip up, catch\
  \ at least the last few minutes, and generally feel like I\u2019d accomplished something\
  \ I was \u2018supposed\u2019 to do in Santorini. I followed where he pointed. I\
  \ clambered up the dusty white-washed steps, settled onto an overturned barrel,\
  \ turned toward the ocean, and momentarily lost my breath. \n\nI like traveling\
  \ alone. I like choosing where I go, what I do, answering to no one but myself.\
  \ I\u2019m happy being my own travel companion, but every once in a while, I see\
  \ something that feels so big that I want to be able to share it with someone else.\
  \ I want to be able to turn to them and ask, do you see that too? Do you feel that\
  \ too? This sunset was one of those things. \n\nHaving been raised on the California\
  \ coast, I\u2019d always thought I was somewhat immune to sunsets, had already seen\
  \ the most beautiful ones I ever would. Santorini proved me wrong. I was just high\
  \ enough that my view of the water was mostly unobstructed, marked only by a line\
  \ of the classic white huts and blue roofs. The sky was cotton-candy pink, vivid,\
  \ deeper and peachier by the bright spot of the sun. The space just above the horizon\
  \ was a moody blue, and the only way I could tell where the sky ended and the sea\
  \ began was in the way the waves glittered in the dying light.\n\nI sat, drinking\
  \ it all in, unable to get my fill. Bursting with wanting to share it with someone,\
  \ anyone. Looking around the roof, feeling just slightly bittersweet, I spied the\
  \ cat, scaling the wall, headed vaguely in my direction.\n\nWell. It would have\
  \ to do. \n\nI waved my hand at it, making tsking noises, looking generally ridiculous.\
  \ The cat kept climbing, leisurely, jumping its way from one structure to the next,\
  \ moving obstinately away from me. Determined, I kept up the noises and the silly\
  \ gestures, until it slowly made its way, circularly, towards me. Nonchalantly,\
  \ it settled against my side, graciously allowed me to pet its head, and looked\
  \ directly at the sky. We watched, together, as the pink faded away completely and\
  \ the moon appeared. We watched until that moment when everything, just like island\u2019\
  s beautiful roofs, was blue."
