Text: "We first meet Tanaka after a series of mis-translated messages, shivering outside\
  \ a train station draped in silver Christmas lights. He looks lost, but then again\
  \ so are we. He helps us move our luggage and in a series of broken conversations\
  \ and single word translations we begin to unravel the mystery that is Tanaka. \n\
  We pull up to a large traditional style house, adjoining tea room overlooking the\
  \ red hills of Nagano. The house is filled with light, centered around an internal\
  \ fire stove where you can smell the lingering embers from a recent night spent\
  \ by the fire. There are two pairs of slippers, one blue, one pink at the entrance\
  \ to the stairwell.\nWe ask him where we should go. He relays the popular spots\
  \ quickly, without glancing up; the shrine, the castle, the local ryokan and then\
  \ pauses hesitatingly before asking \u2013 \u201Cdo you like trees?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Yes\u201D we reply, \n\u201CThere is a shrine\u2026but it\u2019s far\u201D\n\u201C\
  Go on\u201D\n\u201CI like it best\u2026but it is not popular\u201D\n\u201CPlease\
  \ show us\u201D, was all it took for his brown eyes to dart back to ours willingly\
  \ for the first time since we met. \u201CTomorrow morning?\u201D he asks slowly,\
  \ as if to make sure. We confirm.\nHe is up early. Scuffling through the house in\
  \ his blue slippers we wake up to breakfast, he eagerly wrings his hands in the\
  \ tea towel as he watches us sit and take our first bites.\nThe car starts before\
  \ we\u2019ve finished our meal as Tanaka spirits us away up a narrow, winding mountain\
  \ road. He speaks freely for the first time. \u201CI grew up here, I like the mountains.\
  \ I lived in Kyoto for forty years, but I came back to take care of my mother\u201D\
  , for a moment, the pink slippers pass through my mind, \u201Cshe was very sick,\
  \ forgot me, but when she passed, I wanted to go back\u201D. He pauses between sentences,\
  \ searching for words and perhaps as if hearing his own story out loud for the first\
  \ time, remembered something he\u2019d long forgotten. \u201CBut then my sister\u2026\
  she had a bad fall\u2026but I love the mountains\u201D and leaves it at that. \n\
  We stop at a small car park, Tanaka quickly sliding out of his seat and finding\
  \ the beginnings of a mountain trail. For a brief moment he is ageless. He walks\
  \ and climbs with incredible agility, greeting every face we pass along the way.\
  \ We pass through a wooden archway guarded by dragons into a corridor of giant redwood.\
  \ \n\u201CThere was a fire, long ago, these are new \u2026planted three hundred\
  \ years ago, before our ancestors they looked after the trees for thousands of years.\u201D\
  \nWe finally reach the end, rewarded with a small, modest shrine perched on the\
  \ top of a series of stairways overhanging a waterfall. Others pray, Tanaka does\
  \ not. He simply turns around and faces the sea of redwood and patiently waits.\
  \ \nWe decide not to let him linger on our account, and after taking some simple\
  \ photos begin the trek back. His pace quickens as if wanting to be rid of the redwoods\
  \ he was enchanted by only moments ago. Soon he is some distance ahead before I\
  \ decide to utter a few simple words,\n\u201CTanaka-san! Shashin?\u201D\nHe stops\
  \ in his tracks and turns to face me as I hold a single hand in the air signalling\
  \ 3 \u2013 2 \u2013 1 and snap. A polaroid whizzes out and Tanaka is bewildered\
  \ as I hand him a small white square. \nWe stop and watch as the colours appear\
  \ slowly. The redwood passageway forming first, followed by a sea of green and a\
  \ white halo in the centre. Then at the very bottom Tanaka\u2019s visage appears\
  \ last. Slowly, the image of an elderly man with a shy smile appears. He laughs\
  \ lightly for the first time since we\u2019ve met, \u201CI am like the trees.\u201D\
