Text: "Porto\nThe city in which magic becomes real.\nHave you ever wonder from where\
  \ writers and poets get inspired to create their art, fill their book with life\
  \ and transport us to magical places?\n\nEn b\xFAsqueda de un lugar con gente hermosa\n\
  llegu\xE9 a Porto\nsu centro es una gema preciosa\nsu noche es una c\xF3mplice deliciosa\n\
  Oh Porto Porto \nAqu\xED siempre el tiempo queda corto\nWalter Esteban (the original\
  \ poem was in Spanish)\n\nAdaptation\nLooking for a place with beautiful \nBeautiful\
  \ people\nI got to Porto\nThe center is a precious gem\nAnd the night is a delicious\
  \ compliant \nOh Porto Porto\nHere time is always too short\n\nPorto is the city\
  \ in where JK Rowling lived when she wrote Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone\
  \ mean while she was working in a coffee shop. If you observe Porto with attention,\
  \ you will see the details from where she got inspired to add sparks and magic to\
  \ her book. A similar process as how Steven King got inspired from his stay at the\
  \ Stanly Hotel and the isolation that winter brings to write The Shining.\n\nIf\
  \ you want to live the magic go to Porto! Their beautiful street, their delicious\
  \ food, their wine and mainly their beautiful people will make your trip magical.\
  \ If you have seen Harry Potter and you have seen the outfit that magic students\
  \ use to go to Hogwarts, compare it with the praxe, the typical outfit of the Portuguese\
  \ students. Then you will know what I am talking about.\n\nI Porto magic becomes\
  \ real.\n\nWith love Wally\nWalter Esteban"
