Text: "My name is SaidRahman, I was born in Afghanistan. I am a graduate in international\
  \ economics and trade from Lanzhou University of Technology. Currently, I am pursuing\
  \ my Masters in Accounting in the same university. \nLife is about sharing moments.\
  \ Moments that we don\u2019t want to forget. During the 2018 winter break at around\
  \ January, I was lucky enough to travel around Thailand for two weeks. This is a\
  \ beautiful country that everyone would want to visit. The weather is hot most part\
  \ of the year which makes it a very favourite destination for most tourists. Thailand\
  \ boasts of over 20 million tourists in any single year.\nI went to Thailand with\
  \ my friends from different countries. Our journey began from Lanzhou where I have\
  \ been staying for a couple of years now. We needed to get visa from Xian in Shaanxi\
  \ province, china, which is a nearby city. We got there on bullet train and enjoyed\
  \ the beautiful scenery of one of the oldest Chinese cities. Our flight left Xian\
  \ Airport at midnight and it took about 5 hours to get to Bangkok, the capital of\
  \ Thailand. When we arrived at Bangkok airport, we took a taxi to our hotel which\
  \ we had already made reservations. It was amazing how travelling to different locations\
  \ can change the way we see and value things. \nWhen we arrived at the hotel and\
  \ we got a very good Thai reception. The room was very comfortable and clean. After\
  \ taking a shower, we headed out for a bite and see around. Nana Street was just\
  \ round the corner and this is where we had our first experience of what Bangkok\
  \ night life can be. One of the coolest things in Thailand is use of those small\
  \ like motor-vehicles called locally as tuk tuk. On that very first night, we went\
  \ to a friend\u2019s place (by tuk tuk) for dinner. I was a bit nervous to be honest\
  \ but the food was delicious and suitable for all. \nOn the next day, I visited\
  \ the Grand palace and Emerald Buddha Temple. I loved the Emerald Buddha, although\
  \ was a little disappointed because I couldn't get a better photo of it. This is\
  \ a must-see point of interests for tourists who are interested in travelling to\
  \ Thailand. After visiting Grand Palace.\nThe following day we headed to Pattaya\
  \ city which is very close to Bangkok. We spent a lot of time swimming and relaxing\
  \ in a pool or beach. We also got to visit and island called khao lan. On this particular\
  \ day it was so hot. The temperature was approaching almost 40 degree. We spend\
  \ about 5 hours at khao lan swimming, parachuting and interacting with other foreigners\
  \ who were at this place. I happened to take part in one of the water sports which\
  \ is quite common in this area. \nI also happened to take part in deep sea diving.\
  \ In normal cases, people from one boat go together so they can do the activity\
  \ at least for 30 Minutes. We also got to go to Coral Island. Coral Island was beautiful\
  \ and amazing beach. White sandy beaches with crystal clear water which was really\
  \ warm. Different countries have different kind of international restaurants because\
  \ of the fact that most people visiting Thailand come from all over the world. \
  \  \nThe sunrise and sunset in Pattaya are stunningly gorgeous when you are watching\
  \ them from the white-sand-beaches. The mornings and the evenings we spent there\
  \ were worth every penny we spent. We headed to Bangkok after a couple of days to\
  \ enjoy rest of the city life.\nI did some shopping when I got to Bangkok because\
  \ most things were very cheap and good quality. The people in Thailand are amazingly\
  \ kind and very friendly. You get alot of smiles and bowing down say \u201Csawadee\
  \ kap\u201D which is a form of respect as they greet you. The atmosphere is certainly\
  \ certainly relaxed and chilled. Its easy to get familiar with the people in this\
  \ part of the world. Most of the people talk good English which makes it easier\
  \ to communicate with foreigners."
