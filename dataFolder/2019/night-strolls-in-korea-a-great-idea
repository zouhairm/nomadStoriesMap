  \ \u201CWinter in Korea? What a great idea!\u201D I swapped out my Aussie summer\
  \ for a winter studying abroad. It was my third night in Korea. My first \u2018\
  ordinary\u2019 night. The first night after two welcome dinners when my roommate\
  \ and I ate off of plastic serving trays in the school\u2019s cafeteria. \n\nItching\
  \ for something more, I suggested to Ally we go for a walk. She declined. Her intermediate\
  \ Korean class required a lot more work than my beginners\u2013 but going out alone\
  \ didn\u2019t phase me. I pulled on my coat and started with the familiar streets.\
  \ The ones with people, the ones that were well-lit. By contrast, I realised the\
  \ street I\u2019d wandered onto was strangely silent. Foreign conversation and a\
  \ soft radio crackle, trickled toward me down a gap between buildings. Enticed by\
  \ a splash of red, and the warm glow of street lights on the other side, I wedged\
  \ myself around a bike, curved around wet pipes and ducked under air-conditioning\
  \ units until I came out upon a street market. Tables were lined up under marquees,\
  \ covered by red tablecloths and plastic wrapped snacks and side dishes. I recognised\
  \ the pale rounds of lotus roots, and the wet yellow masses of pickled radish. I\
  \ stared at all the kinds of rice cakes\u2013 long and thin, rolled up into balls,\
  \ coloured, powdered. I was even fascinated by the dried fish that were hung up\
  \ on display by their wide, gaping mouths. Spurred on by the find, I kept walking.\n\
  \nI trudged uphill until I was engulfed in a residential area. A mad expanse of\
  \ brick walls, cracked and crumbling\u2013 each with a blue address plate pinned\
  \ beside their gates. It was then that I began to feel lost. As I stood in the quiet\
  \ street, nervously loading a map on my phone, my screen blacked out. I blinked.\
  \ My stomach dropped. Battery life had been my issue with my phone for the two years\
  \ I\u2019d owned it, I knew to make sure I\u2019d have enough! I thought maybe it\
  \ had overheated but the phone was cool in my bare hand. I had used it so much it\
  \ should have been hot. Could the opposite have been true? Could my phone have been\
  \ too cold? The weather would have undoubtably been below zero but being swathed\
  \ in winter wear and having walked myself into a sweat, I hadn\u2019t noticed.\n\
  \nI quickened my pace and came up against a wall. A literal, 5 or 6 metre high wall\
  \ that spanned the length of the road I came out on. It was left or right from here\
  \ and all I could see was grey stone wall. I heard the clack of heels and practically\
  \ jumped on the young woman walking behind me. In what must have sounded like the\
  \ most abrasive Korean I bewilderedly uttered the name of my university and the\
  \ word: \u201Cwhere.\u201D\n\nI\u2019d failed to see it before but right by the\
  \ T-intersection we stood at, was a bus stop. The woman ushered me forward and spoke\
  \ to me as she pointed at a bus route. Her words were just as much a blur as the\
  \ lines that made up the Korean writing on the sign. She kept speaking to me as\
  \ I shook my head and tried to recall anything besides how to count to 5 when, in\
  \ the next moment, a green bus pulled up beside us. She gestured that I get on board\
  \ and spoke hurriedly to the driver as I took my seat. He looked at me in his mirror\
  \ and smiled, nodding to the woman.\n\nI sat on edge, patient but afraid. A couple\
  \ stops later I recognised the university hospital and finally, I relaxed. I\u2019\
  d gotten more than I bargained for that night: the sights, the culture, the language,\
  \ the wonder, the fear and the kindness. The bus driver gave me a signal when it\
  \ was time to get off and I waved as he drove by, laughing up at the Orion constellation\
  \ because the familiarity of it totally balanced out the strangeness of my night.\
  \ What a great idea."
