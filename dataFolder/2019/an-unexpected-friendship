Text: "As I am casually strolling across the bright hotel lobby walking by South African\
  \ statues and paintings of women I spot a beautiful turquoise sofa and a boy sitting\
  \ on it looking out the window across the hall. He seems as if he is lost in his\
  \ own reality or  perhaps wanting to escape out of the building and be somewhere\
  \ else. His eyes are searching for a way out. I wonder what he's looking for. He\
  \ seems very young nineteen maybe twenty his dark glossy hair catches my attention\
  \ there is an alertness in his eyes, behind the glasses that sit crookedly on his\
  \ nose. I smile at him encouragingly and introduce myself. He adjusts his glasses\
  \ his expression is still fixed on the window as if all the answers are written\
  \ there. \nI glance at the direction only to feel his eyes on my shoulders  and\
  \ a sense of curiosity as I turn around our eyes meeting. His dark eye are reassuring\
  \ and peaceful. We engage in conversation about the resort, the trip, our families.\
  \ His eyes are filled with worry as he tells me how nervous he is about talking\
  \ to other people. As the clock ticks and time flies we are sharing past experiences\
  \ everything that shaped and formed us into the two people who are.\nAs we continue\
  \ talking our eyes lock in  shared understanding we both get the feeling as if we'd\
  \ known each other for years.\nDo you want to eat? he asks as he peers down the\
  \ hall where everyone else has took their place at the breakfast table.\nWe have\
  \ arrived to a java conference with our families but both of us are outsiders still\
  \ high school students admiring all the adults, longing to be a part of their world\
  \ as if again we became little children.\nWe can get our own table I suggest and\
  \ his face relaxes I lead the way smiling and waving at everyone as we find our\
  \ own time, world, space.\n\nWe spend the rest of the week at the beach or near\
  \ the pool him hiding from the sun sitting under big umbrella's burying his head\
  \ in a book. And me close by exposing my skin to the burning sunlight enjoying the\
  \ warmth and tranquility of a hot summer day. At night we walk under the stars,\
  \ In every direction I tilt my head, gazing upward, eyes more open than they can\
  \ be in the fullness of day, not looking at one star, yet somehow seeing them all\
  \ at once.\n\nStars he said at once I don't get to see them a lot living in the\
  \ city he looks at them with joy and tries to reach up to catch one. \ni could stay\
  \ here forever I say.\nUnfortunately the weeks flies by days turn into hours and\
  \ hours into minutes as I wave my new companion good bye and look back just once\
  \ more as he enters his suite with all the new memories following him."
