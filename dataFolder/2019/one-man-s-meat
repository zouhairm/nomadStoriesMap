Text: "Bernard had called me that afternoon excitedly to tell me that he\u2019d found\
  \ land that would suit my farming project, adding that the location was as close\
  \ as my lips from my nose. \n\n\u201CA boda-boda (motorbike used for quick transit\
  \ around the city) will get us there and back in less than an hour\u201D, he\u2019\
  d assured me. \n\nWhat I imagined would be a half hour journey triples in time,\
  \ results in three people stranded in the middle of nowhere with a busted bike and\
  \ black nimbus clouds gathering fast in the distance. The last home we have seen\
  \ is a good mile out and the nearest town, the only place we can get a good mechanic,\
  \ is a probable six to eight miles away.\n\n\"Do you know any mechanic nearby?\"\
  \ I implore the motorbike owner who shakes his head sulkily. \n\"Maybe we can call...\"\
  \ Bernard the land agent starts but I interject\n \"We are surrounded by a forest\
  \ of eucalyptus trees for miles and there\u2019s no cell phone reception.\"\n\n\
  There\u2019s a sound of an approaching motorbike and within no time we are waving\
  \ down a skinny adolescent boy. We plead with him to send a mechanic our way and\
  \ give him a few shillings for his troubles.\n\n\"Hmmm, I don\u2019t know who will\
  \ come in this rain\", he gestures at the sky. \u201CI\u2019ll try my best but please\
  \ stay under this tree. It\u2019s not safe around these parts,\u201D he cautions\
  \ as he speeds off towards town.\n\nThe sky rumbles like a giant empty belly as\
  \ two men ride towards us. They promise to send a mechanic. In Uganda, light drizzles\
  \ quickly become fat heavy raindrops and in a matter of minutes we are drenched.\n\
  \n\u201CDo you even know where we\u2019re going? You said it was a stone\u2019s\
  \ throw away, that a car would be a waste of fuel!\" I snap at the Bernard. \nLightning\
  \ and thunder drown him out and punctuate our argument.\n\nUpset, cold and wet,\
  \ I walk off towards the town. The other two follow; our shoes squelching and caking\
  \ with more mud with each step. Twenty minutes later, we spot smoke coming from\
  \ a grass thatched mud and wattle hut. A little lady, old but sinewy, meets us outside.\
  \ She expresses her sympathies and offers us some tea as she sets up a mat for us\
  \ to sit by the warm fire in her hut. Oh the benevolence of rural folk! \nA little\
  \ boy, about eight, shirtless with tattered shorts saunters in, in his eyes, an\
  \ expression I cannot read. He runs out and starts to peer at us from the small\
  \ window in the shy manner of all rural children. After a few sips of the tea I\
  \ start to yawn. It\u2019s been a long day. \n\nSuddenly, I recall the boy who told\
  \ us not to seek shelter under any circumstance and jolt up from the mat, sending\
  \ the cups flying. As Bernard moves to save them, the mat caves in and he begins\
  \ to plummet into a hole in the ground.\nThe boda-boda rider scrambles off the edge\
  \ of the mat just in time. A scream loud enough to wake the dead reverberates around\
  \ the hut and it\u2019s later that I realize it came from me. The little peeping\
  \ Tom emerges, wielding a machete. The boda rider shouting, picks a piece of burning\
  \ wood from the fire and waves it around the boy frantically.  Out of thin air,\
  \ the two men who pretended to check our bike join him and come at us. The lady\
  \ inches towards me, a knife in hand, the kindness from earlier replaced with a\
  \ cold glare.\n\nI hear loud shouts and calls coming from outside.\n\n\"Great, more\
  \ people arriving for the feast\".  My heart is thundering, head is spinning and\
  \ the ground rises to meet me. \n\nSomeone shakes me violently and I open my eyes\
  \ to see the young lad from earlier with two other men. \nHe later narrates that\
  \ he had returned with the mechanic and on hearing the scream, the other rural dwellers\
  \ had come to our aid. An angry mob was hunting down the savages who\u2019d retreated\
  \ in the woods nearby.\n\nWe lived to see another day."
