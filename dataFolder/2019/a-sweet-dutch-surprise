Text: "The best part of Amsterdam is not what you think. \n\nIt's not the Mary Jane.\
  \ It's not the grass. Not the green. Not the reefer, either. The best part of Amsterdam\
  \ was a light, fluffy and unexpected surprise. I'll get to that later. \n\nAt the\
  \ start of the trip, all I wanted was to experience a new country and a new culture.\
  \ We were a small group of teaching assistants taking a bus from Paris to Amsterdam.\
  \ It was the end of October.\n\nA cheap, 7-hour bus ride. A cheap, 6-bed hostel\
  \ room. Shortly after we arrived, we were off to the first coffee shop. Barney's.\
  \ A tiny, quiet establishment where locals and tourists alike casually smoked joints.\
  \ \n\nThat night we also tried out a place called Wonder Bar, a local watering hole\
  \ about a five-minute walk from the Amsterdam Centraal Station. Fluorescent lights\
  \ and bright decor belied the bar's chill, relaxed atmosphere. The bartenders were\
  \ kind and patient with tourists in a city so overrun with them it would be easy\
  \ to become frustrated. \n\nI try to make a point of eating the local cuisine when\
  \ I go to a new country. I ordered a gouda cheese sandwich and bitterballen, a type\
  \ of Dutch meatball. I bit inside, expecting the usual ground meat and found it\
  \ was gooey inside instead! I washed all this down with a Heineken, of course, the\
  \ national \u2014 albeit overrated \u2014 beverage of the Netherlands.\n\nNext,\
  \ we took a stroll along the red light district. It wasn't what I expected. I was\
  \ picturing a cabaret, open-spirit vibe. Instead I felt for the workers, who seemed\
  \ exhausted by the sheer magnitude of leering tourists. \n\nTo our surprise, tourists\
  \ packed the city even on a Monday evening in October. Ourselves included. I believe\
  \ that was the night a tipsy British woman handed us free cans of Heineken on the\
  \ cobblestone streets. I took a beer back to the hostel, where they also had Heineken\
  \ in the vending machines. \n\nThe next morning, we toured downtown. Bike riders\
  \ everywhere. There were beautiful bridges above the canals. The sky was grey overhead,\
  \ but the water sparkled still. At Dam Square, the local picturesque plaza, a beautiful\
  \ recording of Vivaldi's Winter blared through the speakers. Or so I thought. \n\
  \nI turned around and instead saw a small group of string players. They sounded\
  \ like an entire orchestra. I stopped to marvel at the performance, then we continued\
  \ to walk down the city streets. \n\nThe biggest surprise came next. \n\nWe found\
  \ a culinary delight amid the coffee shops and canals. That day, I decided the best\
  \ part of Amsterdam was their pancakes. \n\nWe went to the Happy Pig Pancake Shop,\
  \ home of the self-proclaimed \"best pancakes in Amsterdam.\" On the menu: mini\
  \ puff pancakes filled with gouda cheese and fig jam. A server brought out a long,\
  \ narrow tray with several bite-sized, rolled up pancakes, melted cheese spilling\
  \ out of the side while fig jam and powdered sugar dotted the top. \n\nI took a\
  \ bite. \n\nIt was too good to be true. So warm. So soft. But not too sweet. The\
  \ perfect balance of sugary and savoury. In that moment, I realized my trip had\
  \ hit its peak. It was all downhill from there. \n\nI had reached my own, personal\
  \ high in Amsterdam.\n\nAnd \u2014 surprise, surprise \u2014it had nothing to do\
  \ with weed."
