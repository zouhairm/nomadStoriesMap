Text: "I rode out in a four by four with friends from the Moroccan village of Merzouga\
  \ into the Sahara desert to have tea with a Berber family.  Hakim was sitting under\
  \ his tent weaving a new wool panel to replace one worn out by the desert winds.\
  \  He rose to greet us and called to his wife, who came out carrying their young\
  \ daughter.  Together they welcomed us and invited us into the tent.  Even with\
  \ the flaps raised, the air was stifling, and I could see why they spent most of\
  \ their time outside or in the cooler shade of the small mud house that they had\
  \ nearby.  \n\nAs we took our seats on the carpet, Hakim\u2019s wife, Lalla, left\
  \ the baby with her husband and went to the mud house to get our tea.  She returned\
  \ with a tray laden with glasses and a tea pot, and she went around the circle and\
  \ poured the mint tea into our glasses.  She then settled near her husband with\
  \ their little girl, Tamimt, on her lap.  As neither Hakim nor his wife spoke English,\
  \ our guide served as translator as we shared tea and conversation.  \nHakim told\
  \ us that he also had a son, aged 10, who was off working with his uncle taking\
  \ care of their camel in Merzouga.  They rented the camel out to tourist camel trains\
  \ at the nearby hotels for their overnight adventures into the Sahara.  I would\
  \ be leaving on such an adventure that evening, and I wondered if by chance I would\
  \ ride on their camel.\n\nHakim grew up living as a nomadic shepherd, but now, he\
  \ told us, he was considering leaving that life behind and moving into Merzouga,\
  \ a small town nearby.  He wanted his children to have the opportunity to go to\
  \ school, and he hoped to be able to find steady work and be able to provide for\
  \ his family in a permanent home.  There was sadness in his voice as he told us\
  \ this, and I sensed that he was apprehensive about leaving the life he had known.\n\
  \nThrough our translator, I said \u201CI am a teacher.  When I speak with my students,\
  \ what would you like me to tell them about you and your way of life?\u201D  He\
  \ thought for a long time as we all sipped our tea.  Finally, he said, \u201CI want\
  \ them to know that this life is hard, but it is a good life.  When I was young\
  \ we herded our sheep over there (he pointed to the dunes in the direction of the\
  \ nearby Algerian border) But now the border is closed and we cannot cross.  I no\
  \ longer have enough pasture for my sheep.  I must find a new way to take care of\
  \ my family.  Going to school will also be good, but I am sad for my children that\
  \ they will not grow up in the way that I have.\u201D\n\nNow it was our turn to\
  \ think quietly for a while. He had found ways to adapt: renting out his camel,\
  \ taking in tourists for tea, and ultimately considering giving up his nomadic lifestyle\
  \ permanently.  I was grateful to be sitting under his tent and talking with him\
  \ about his experiences. I realized that his way of life may soon be memory, something\
  \ seen in photographs and history books, and I too was touched by sadness.\nMeanwhile,\
  \ I savored the tea, played with baby, smiled at Lalla, and enjoyed the moment.\
  \  I may not be able to change the politics which closes borders or slow down the\
  \ fast pace of the modernized world, but I could be present in that time and place\
  \ and honor Hakim and his family for their friendliness and sincerity, and I brought\
  \ his story with me as I returned to my home."
