Text: "A Traveller\u2019s Lament. 1. Movement\n\nWe all try to build a conceptual\
  \ model outlining our journey - our itinerary. This document pertains all the necessary\
  \ and important information that could potentially lead to significant events in\
  \ our life. It teaches us what we should do but essentially it taught me one invaluable\
  \ lesson, to lose custody of my expectations. I was no longer held captive to the\
  \ inevitable disappointment that comes with plans falling apart but emancipated\
  \ from the tyranny of travelling with a litany of presuppositions.\n\nMy lecturer\
  \ once said if there\u2019s only one book you read in your life it should be Gulliver\u2019\
  s travels. I never understood at the time why he prefaced that book over the many\
  \ literary classics. However, now that I\u2019ve experienced a little bit of travelling\
  \ first hand I understand that just like Gulliver\u2019s Travels the prose focuses\
  \ on human nature and travel. If anything travel is often portrayed as an adventure\
  \ story but the true experience is often in reality a misadventure. Our human nature\
  \ truly expresses itself through the latter, true to form I\u2019ve had a series\
  \ of mishaps but there is a port in every storm.\n\nSomething as simple as flying\
  \ in an airplane was akin to a mission to outer space. I was awestruck at how new\
  \ everything was to me as this was as much a part of my journey than the destination.\
  \ My maiden voyage was to Hua Hin, a quiet fishing village on the Gulf of Thailand.\
  \ You know you\u2019re in a foreign place because it assaults your senses, the air\
  \ was heavy and polluted in combination with the heat it feels as if you\u2019re\
  \ suffocating on the very thing that keeps you alive. I didn\u2019t expect to find\
  \ that I would trade my clean western air for that putrid smell of an intoxicating\
  \ aroma of freedom. No clutching my purse close to my body or looking over my shoulder,\
  \ I was safe walking alone at night and I didn\u2019t expect to ever experience\
  \ that privilege.\n\nHua Hin left an imprint on my psyche just like their mosquito\
  \ bite both painful and pleasurable. The roads were full of stray dogs and you\u2019\
  ll always have a friend around every corner. They don\u2019t interfere they keep\
  \ to themselves but its almost as if you have an audience watching your life play\
  \ out, its both daunting and comforting, guardian angels looking to protect you\
  \ and magistrates that will divinely determine judgment.\n\nI didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to discover that I carried baggage besides that of my luggage. Travelling alone\
  \ is like having a built in best friend and your worst enemy. I crossed an ocean,\
  \ I entered a different time zone and I didn\u2019t expect to find that the complex\
  \ matrix of our lives exists in between time and space. Graft vs host. A condition\
  \ where a donor\u2019s stem cells view\u2019s the recipient\u2019s body as foreign\
  \ and therefore attacks it. It is capable of going away once the body has grown\
  \ accustomed to the invasion. Taking myself out of a familiar environment I never\
  \ expected that I would undergo a transplantation of an acute and varying kind.\
  \ Travelling a myth of movement that will soothe the existential dread. The art\
  \ of travel is the most complex of symphonies, compositional elements ranging from\
  \ high to low, an unadulterated euphoria and the resounding accompaniment of melancholy.\
  \ My travel repertoire is nowhere near completion, you could say I\u2019m in Schubert\
  \ territory, It\u2019s my big \u201Cthe Unfinished\u201D. We all know at least one\
  \ person who goes on a diatribe against travelling to certain places, whether it\u2019\
  s the promise land or the wasteland, you\u2019re in the bosom of blessed hope and\
  \ travelling is the heavenly dread that befalls us if we\u2019re lucky enough. So\
  \ lament brave travellers, development requires motion. The movement the rise and\
  \ fall of it all is ultimately to live. \n\nThe most important lesson of them all\u2026\
  \ I didn\u2019t to find that the grass isn\u2019t greener on the other side just\
  \ a different shade of green and I didn\u2019t expect to realize that when my plans\
  \ fail, it doesn\u2019t mean I did. At first you are a transplant, but then your\
  \ foreign body will adjust."
