Text: "This past summer I got the opportunity to explore the continent of Africa for\
  \ the first time! On my first day in Morocco, I was dazzled by the donkey carts\
  \ riding\_down\_one of the souks decorated with a plethora of colorful dyes, exotic\
  \ spices and lanterns. As much as it was a magical experience, it was also a culture\
  \ shock for me to be at the busy center of Jemaa El Fna in Marrakech, one of the\
  \ biggest cities in Morocco. Having heard rumors about scams in the big square,\
  \ I was apt to avoid the Hanna lady who would grab my arm and demand payments for\
  \ the unwanted doodling. I also made sure I didn\u2019t pause to take a picture\
  \ of the snake charmer who would demand a fee for including his precious creature\
  \ in my photograph.\n      Just a few blocks away from the main square, a nice local\
  \ was enthusiastic to show me the tannery that was supposed to happen once a year,\
  \ and today would be the last day to see it. I had never heard of this event from\
  \ my friends, but I found myself asking \u201Cwhat could go wrong if I check it\
  \ out?\u201D. I was lured deep in as this guy kept walking and leading my way, all\
  \ too casually asking how my day was. When we arrived, we did a tour around the\
  \ tannery, all the while the pungent smell of curing hides bombarded my nostrils,\
  \ and the dirty feathers dripping in blood made me anxiously reflect again as to\
  \ why I decided to go there in the first place. I was then guided to a three-level\
  \ shopping mall, but while there I made sure I didn\u2019t buy any of the precious\
  \ hand-dyed leather goods. At the end of the tour, this guy demanded money from\
  \ me in hostile manner for having \u201Cguided\u201D me around: 200 dirhams (20\
  \ USD). I didn\u2019t agree beforehand about the exchange of money for the \u201C\
  tour\u201D, but I was also disadvantaged to be in a narrow aisle with nearly no\
  \ public visibility, except a few whom I suspect to be of the same party as the\
  \ \u201Ctour guide\u201D. I used a magic sentence and that got me out of the situation,\
  \ and paid nothing for the \u201Ctour\u201D. Can you guess what this magic phrase\
  \ is? \n\t Later in the day, I used Google Maps to look for a restaurant while a\
  \ youngster followed me and demanded another 200 dirhams for having \u201Ctaken\
  \ me\u201D to the right spot. I had enough sympathy to offer him food, but he refused\
  \ and hassled me for coming from a wealthier country. I ended up giving him 50 dirhams\
  \ (5 USD). At the end of the day, I could have spent 250 dirhams on scams if I did\
  \ not know the magic phrase.\n\tNot all cities in Morocco, however, are filled with\
  \ hassles and scams. The next day I traveled to Agadir, a beautiful beach town just\
  \ two-hours\u2019 drive away from Marrakesh. It was a vibrant city with a wide range\
  \ of activities ranging from riding camels at the beach, watching imported Nile\
  \ crocodiles spinning down a slide, riding buggy cart at the desert, and enjoying\
  \ cheap, delicious fish fresh from the Atlantic Ocean with attentive service.\n\t\
  Traveling is for me both a magical and humbling experience. As a young female always\
  \ on the go, there is need to avail myself of any fresh and innovative tools there\
  \ are to help navigate risky and troublesome adventures abroad; there\u2019s a constant\
  \ need for information while dealing with ins-and-outs of exotic destinations. For\
  \ this reason, I want to share my experience, to helps travelers to be mentally\
  \ and financially prepared even before stepping foot onto a new continent. \n\t\
  I hope my Morocco excursion serve as useful insight for would-be travelers who are\
  \ exploring the world in 2019 and beyond. With the power of sharing, we are make\
  \ traveling fun and hassle-free for every individual, thus benefiting the traveling\
  \ community as a whole."
