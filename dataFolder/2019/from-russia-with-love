Text: "Travelling has always been a part of my life and I feel it is a huge privilege\
  \ to get to explore the world the way I intend to.\n\nI had already set foot on\
  \ at least 40 countries when I felt it was the right time to fulfill my biggest\
  \ dream: crossing Russia through the Transiberian Railway. I didn't just want to\
  \ get on a plane to Russia and sit on the train for 10.000 km. My dream was much\
  \ greater than that.\n\nSo I started learning Russian. The idea was to familiarize\
  \ with the cyrilic alphabet and learn a few things for basic communication, but\
  \ I ended up taking it a bit too seriously and doing 6 whole semesters. To me, travelling\
  \ has never been just going places. Speaking the language is an important part of\
  \ understanding the culture. Of course I didn't master the Russian language in 6\
  \ semesters, but I got the idea and bought a travel guide.\n\nThe more I read about\
  \ the railway and the country, the less I knew about it. So yes: I took Russian\
  \ geopolitics classes. Suddenly things started making sense: the physical greatness\
  \ of the country, the culture, the people. The 100th anniversary of the Russian\
  \ Revolution was near: it was time for me to go.\n\nThe flight to Vladivostok was\
  \ long. It was my first time flying with a Russian airline, the first time I was\
  \ putting my skills to test... and everything was just fine. I chose to travel westbound,\
  \ from Vladivostok to Moscow and it was a very good choice. Vladivostok exists!\
  \ - It's not just a region which allows you to conquer the U.S.A. through Alaska\
  \ on the map of the board game Risk.\n\nNo words can describe how powerful it felt\
  \ to have the first Transiberian train ticket on my hands. My dream was finally\
  \ coming true. Russia is big. They have 11 different time zones and the trains run\
  \ on Moscow time. I was 7 hours ahead of Moscow and this meant arriving at the train\
  \ station 6 hours after the time shown on my ticket. It was crazy.\n\nThere are\
  \ 3 compartments on the train: first, second and third class. The third class is\
  \ the cheapest and probably the safest for solo women travelers as the beds are\
  \ all together in an open space unlike the second class where every 4 beds are located\
  \ in a smaller compartment with a closed door. Third class was my choice so I ended\
  \ up travelling with the military all the way. Most of the time I was the only female\
  \ apart from the provodnitza taking care of the wagon. If felt weird, but not dangerous\
  \ and the guys would come talk to me not expecting me to understand them, but happy\
  \ I did. A guy asked if I had left my man in the far east of if was going to meet\
  \ him in Moscow. Later I found out they assumed I was married to a marine because\
  \ I have a lighthouse tattooed on my arm. \n\nIt's amazing how nice strangers can\
  \ be. People had never seen me, we would communicate because all parts wanted and\
  \ there they were: offering me food, covering me with a blanket during the night,\
  \ showing me videos of their families, giving me their phone number if I ever stopped\
  \ by their tiny little village in siberia. On my way to Novosibirsk I was literally\
  \ hypnotized by a therapist who wanted to confirm he could do it even if I couldn't\
  \ understand the language completely, I played with a little girl for hours without\
  \ speaking a word, I got sick and was taken care of by an old couple from Kazan.\
  \ \n\nThe train took me from the Far East to Europe, through buddhist, muslim and\
  \ orthodox Russia. I crossed the beautiful Baikal lake and did not meet a single\
  \ foreigner on the train. As I reached my final destination, I could only be sure\
  \ that Russians have hearts as big as their homeland and I had now room for other\
  \ dreams as this one had become reality."
