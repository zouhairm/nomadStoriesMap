Text: "Deciding to open that window inside me, to see and recognize that fear, and\
  \ to accept the panic and terror it still produces in me, caused me to isolate myself\
  \ in my new bedroom, dark and welcoming, for three days.\n\n\u2018Getting back on\
  \ the bike\u2019, as they say, is a key lesson when learning to ride a bike. That\
  \ lesson seemed to materialize itself into one of the most self-challenging situations\
  \ I have confronted, as I returned from my first day of work in a new city. Even\
  \ now I can only attempt to piece together the events of that day. \n\nAs I regained\
  \ consciousness, my instinctive reaction was to try and rebuild what had happened\
  \ within the last few hours.\nI felt the wave of anxiety surge through me, prickling\
  \ my skin and making me dizzy, as I forced my brain to reassemble a narrative. Another\
  \ wave, stronger, as I couldn\u2019t seem to piece things together, my memory pierced\
  \ by mental lagoons.\nAs I looked out the Urgency Hall window, I realized it was\
  \ night-time. The last I could remember, I had been turning onto Rue du Tondu. It\
  \ had been daytime.\nI noticed I was lying on a paper covered stretcher. I gazed\
  \ at my passport, which was tucked into my backpack, and turned around as someone\
  \ moaned. I froze.\nA reddish half-dried stain the size of my head smeared the top\
  \ of the stretcher. I immediately touched the back of my head and then stared at\
  \ my hand in disbelief. My bloodied hand seemed to fall limp onto my lap.\nAnother\
  \ violent wave of anxiety shook me, prickling my skin with gooseflesh as an overpowering\
  \ dizziness washed through me, again.\nOnly when I touched my cheek with my other\
  \ hand, did I feel the hot stream, acknowledging the tears.\n\n\u201CGood evening\
  \ Monsieur,\nPlease excuse me for my absence. Yesterday, returning to my home, I\
  \ had an epileptic seizure on the street.\nThe doctor at the Urgency has given me\
  \ indications to rest completely.\u201D\nI sent the email to my boss. I hated having\
  \ to expose myself, explain my uncomfortable and seemingly unreal situation, but\
  \ simply disappearing wasn\u2019t an option.\n\nHaving arrived four days ago in\
  \ Bordeaux, struggling with the language and my current situation, just the thought\
  \ of leaving my room and having to walk out onto the street again, made my stomach\
  \ clench and my face tingle with an odd numbness.\nSo after only four days, I had\
  \ a choice to make- to simply put back down everything I\u2019d picked up and accepted\
  \ by coming to this new city, and return home to my comfort zone, or force myself\
  \ to get up every morning against that panicked voice in my head, walk out onto\
  \ the street, and simply make it through another day.\n\nTravelling to Bordeaux,\
  \ what I most looked forward to, was the freedom and independence one experiences\
  \ as a solo traveller. An incredibly joyful silence, or maybe peace, filled me that\
  \ first weekend, as I submerged myself into a new culture and city with no expectations\
  \ or loads, only carrying with me that which I considered valuable, and letting\
  \ myself be filled with new experiences.\n\nHowever, that independence quickly became\
  \ a miserable solitude, making me yearn for security and company, after that night.\
  \ I had such a strong urge to fly home I felt desperate, limited, scared. Most of\
  \ all, I hated the vulnerability and absolute lack of certainty. \nAnd yet I knew\
  \ this struggle was a strenuous wrestle only I could come to terms with.\n\nAnd\
  \ so, travelling exposes you, whether one is willing to be or not.\nIt exposes you\
  \ to beautiful, enriching cultures, people and landscapes, but can also expose you\
  \ to yourself, forcing you to visit those deep, hidden fears, wrestle until you\
  \ come to terms with them, and reemerge molded by those experiences, grateful for\
  \ having been able to grow through them.\n\nI have now been living in Bordeaux for\
  \ over a month. I\u2019m simply grateful for the pure joy I feel at being able to\
  \ get on my bike and ride through the beautiful city, everyday."
