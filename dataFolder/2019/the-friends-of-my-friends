Text: "It's 2 a.m. in Bairro Alto. Cobbled streets teem with life as students, expats,\
  \ locals, and tourists mingle, forgetting the impermanence of relationships built\
  \ on vacation. The air rattles with a kind of laughter that topples language barriers.\
  \ I watch Nuno fervently pour another pint of Sagres, pairing it with an unexpectedly\
  \ refreshing shooter of vodka, amarguinha (almond liqueur), and a drop of lemon\
  \ juice. Lisbon feels like Bacchus\u2019 summer home.\n\nAs a Bolivian man and I\
  \ discuss the sociology of drug legalization, my attention is stolen by a glimpse\
  \ of someone in the periphery. I pivot, coming face-to-face with Anita: a young\
  \ woman I once worked with in Toronto, Canada. Our eyes widen and our jaws drop\
  \ as we recognize each other through the crowd. \"What the fuck!\" we belt, double-taking\
  \ to make sure we're sane and sober; it's been nearly two years since we last saw\
  \ each other. While we were never the closest of work friends, we'd bond over the\
  \ occasional quip at the expense of a garishly dressed customer. And here we are\
  \ \u2013 in the same foreign country, on the same Friday night, standing outside\
  \ the same bar. \n\nWe catch up. Anita mentions her flight to Paris the following\
  \ morning and introduces me to her Brazilian hostel-mate, an honorary local, and\
  \ my next liaison: Livia. The night peters out. I exchange phone numbers with Livia\
  \ over shawarma (fun fact: Portuguese shawarma is tastier than the Israeli counterpart\
  \ \u2013 who would've guessed). A smile creeps across my face as I fill my lungs\
  \ with the balmy June air. I imagine every possible tomorrow.\n\nThe following day\
  \ starts like every other; with an obligatory pastel de nata. The tart's creamy,\
  \ flaky, sweetness balances a dark, full-bodied espresso. I'm a man of many vices,\
  \ but those edible palm-sized delights bring more satisfaction than the next dozen\
  \ on my list. I digress. \n\nAfter breakfast, I walk to Pra\xE7a do Com\xE9rcio,\
  \ which is outfitted with an astroturf field and movie-theatre-sized screen to broadcast\
  \ the 2018 FIFA World Cup. I find Livia sitting outside a coffee shop, surrounded\
  \ by the people I was about to meet. She introduces me to Sol and Maria. It\u2019\
  s often hard to describe those kinds of people who understand letting go of the\
  \ illusion of control and allowing time to take them where they need to be.\n\n\
  Sol is olive skinned, and his name translates literally to, \u201Csun.\u201D The\
  \ 5-foot-6 firecracker has a head of thick, black, windswept hair. Warm, honey-coloured\
  \ eyes adorn his prominent brow, and last week\u2019s 5 o\u2019clock shadow frames\
  \ his elongated face. His late-twenty-something jawline is toned by years of singing\
  \ and dancing, but don\u2019t think of him as a performer. Performers sing to live;\
  \ Sol sings to sing. He walks with a humble, confident tenacity and speaks to understand.\
  \ We bond over a shared passion for dancing aggressively to loud music.\n\nIf Sol\
  \ is the sun, Maria is the moon. Her black, sun-kissed, chest-length hair drapes\
  \ over her round face, slender frame, and dark, walnut skin. Her inviting, hazel\
  \ eyes shine with the excited glimmer of youth. She speaks with the resolute voice\
  \ of maturity. Her head, balanced on an elegant neck, conveys an inner calm \u2013\
  \ an insightful dignity, free from pretension. She also likes to surf.\n\nI spend\
  \ the next two weeks getting to know the pair. I piece together their backstories,\
  \ wholly unaware of how quickly and deeply I would bond to those two soulful individuals.\
  \ They become my locals, and I, their tourist.\n\nAt 3 a.m. one evening, the local\
  \ nightclub, Lux becomes the topic of conversation. We enter, go down a flight of\
  \ stairs, past soundproof windows, and into a dark room, joining the sea of bobbing,\
  \ bouncing people. Raving ensues.\n\nI lose track of time and escape to the balcony\
  \ in search of air. I find my extended family already there, arms folded over the\
  \ railing, watching a yellow sun, rising over the Tagus River to dissolve the night's\
  \ excitement.\n\nThey don't notice me as I approach, continuing their Portuguese\
  \ conversation. While I don\u2019t know the meaning of their words, I wholeheartedly\
  \ understand what they say. Sol dances lazily to a non-existent tune as Maria discusses\
  \ breakfast."
