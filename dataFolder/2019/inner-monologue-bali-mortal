Text: "This is the real story,\nthe beginning of my traveling, \na journey that Universe\
  \ prepares for me to understand the meaning of life.\n\n2018, December 15th - Bali,\
  \ my first destination. \nUsing the train, I left my comfort zone, my hometown.\
  \ Left my family, friends, good job, and even left behind all the luxury I could\
  \ get there.\n\nI have a little savings to survive for at least a year, of course\
  \ I prepare for this trip, because this is not a sudden decision. I have been thinking\
  \ about solo traveling while writing a book for the past year. \nYes! While writing\
  \ a book, Universe wants me to write about everything I learned in this journey,\
  \ and share that knowledge with all the inhabitants of the earth in words.\n\nBut\
  \ I forgot,\nBali is too charming to not to taste its pleasures. The first week\
  \ here, I spent traveling around to see the beauty of this island. Starting from\
  \ west at Gilamanuk, north at Lovina, east at Amed, and south at Uluwatu. Very beautiful\
  \ and amazing, this place is truly a paradise of this world.\nBeaches, mountains,\
  \ waterfalls, lakes, villages. Makes a unbearable desire for making love with it.\
  \ Until I forget, what should I do here. And one day, someone stole my MacBook.\
  \ The most valuable asset for writing. However, I didn't pay attention to it, I\
  \ still thought I could buy a new one with my money.\n\nAnd I'm complacent again,\n\
  The second week, I spend partying and spree. Too many night\u2019s lifes that make\
  \ my adrenaline stick out. Until one night at the ATM, I saw that my balance in\
  \ my account was only 5000 Rupiah, equivalent to 0.35 USD. The origin is I still\
  \ have 72,000,000 Rupiah or 5000 USD. I can't say anything, someone scammed my bank\
  \ account. And I understand, Universe was mad at me.\n\nI did not know how to survive\
  \ without money, so I was busy looking for other jobs that could sustain my finances\
  \ until I had the provision to continue this journey again. But again, I was deceived\
  \ by the situation. I spent one week for nothing, without writing.\n\nUntil I realized,\
  \ I had a promise to the Universe, I had to learn something and write it. For that,\
  \ I decided to go to Ubud, a place where spiritualists gather. They can certainly\
  \ help me interpret this life, I thought.\nI met great peoples like Mathias and\
  \ Coleen who would always be my mentors. \n\nAnd, \nI found love here.\n\nI met\
  \ Scott, a British guy who also traveled to find inner peace. We spent 36 days together,\
  \ I was crazy about him, I really madly in love with him more than anything. Until\
  \ his last night in Bali, Universe showed who he really was. I broke, shattered.\
  \ I didn't realize when I with him, I forgot to loving the Universe.\n\nThat night,\
  \ while crying I left Scott. \nHe is Vanya, a Russian guy who is very beautiful,\
  \ and very sincere. He hugs me warmly and wipes my tears. \nHe replaced Scott, \n\
  I didn't fall in love with him, but for 20 days I was very happy with him. Until\
  \ finally he had to continue his trip to Portugal. \nand He is gone, like Scott.\n\
  \nI cried again. \nI was alone, I thought. \nI have nothing, and I'm stuck on this\
  \ island of gods. I think the Universe is angry to me.\n\nBut not,\n\n2019, February\
  \ 26th - still in Bali\nThe Universe came to me last night, and said \"You have\
  \ learned, how to be mortal. That's life. About losing.\u201D\n\nI want to be angry\
  \ at the Universe because he took everything from me. But I understand, that was\
  \ my first lesson.\n\nToday I got the possibility of getting money from the savings\
  \ that I forgot. Not too much, but it's probably enough to continue this journey.\
  \ I'm ready to leave, thankyou Bali for your mortalism. \n\nMy next, Nepal."
