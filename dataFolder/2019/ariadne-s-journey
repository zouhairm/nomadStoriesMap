Text: "Last fall with a wish and a hope I packed a borrowed backpack and booked a\
  \ flight to Heraklion, Crete setting out on a journey to reconnect with my truth.\
  \  For the past 4 years I\u2019ve been attempting to build a business focused on\
  \ encouraging people to clear their old stories and embark upon their mythic journey.\
  \ It is a bold choice to live the life you dream of but have been scared to embark\
  \ upon! I realized I have been in a cycle of embarking upon this journey myself\
  \ and then running back to the safety of old patterns that no longer serve my chosen\
  \ path. The old way of relating was through playing small and stuck in victim mentality.\
  \ I can tell you from experience this is not the path to freedom, self-actualization,\
  \ or joy. This path opens you up to enmeshed relationships, and a multitude of icky\
  \ feelings steeped in half truths, compromise, and resentment. This is not how I\
  \ want to relate to people. It seemed I walked away from most relationships feeling\
  \ depleted and mourning broken promises. But in the end I realized I had no one\
  \ to blame but myself because I did not listen to that small voice i side myself\
  \ that eventually started screaming at my through chronic pain, depression, and\
  \ a multitude of pent up emotions. I had not been setting my boundaries, speaking\
  \ my truth, and trusting myself. I had deminished my own self worth. I was playing\
  \ small, hidding, and protecting myself.  It was time to face the fears, rebuild\
  \ a secure relationship with myself, and move forward. When I wrote my business\
  \ plan in 2014 through Women\u2019s Economic Venture\u2019s I was inspired by the\
  \ story of Ariadne. She gave the golden thread to Theseus to help him in his quest\
  \ to defeat the Minotaur and return safely from the Labyrinth Maze at Knossos Palace.\
  \ Theseus has set out on this quest to free the innocents of Athen\u2019s that were\
  \ sent as sacrifices to the Minotaur every 7 years. This story serves as a metaphor\
  \ for one entering the psyche or mind, confronting your shadow, and slaying it to\
  \ save your innocence. On a personal level it served as a metaphor for me saving\
  \ myself from my own inner monster. \nOn another level Theseus had made a promise\
  \ to Ariadne that he would take her to Athens if she helped him defeat the Minotaur.\
  \ She knew helping him would exile her from her people and family because the Minotaur\
  \ was her half-brother. Minos, her father, had been rumored to be a tyrant, so it\u2019\
  s easy to see why Ariadne would want to escape. However abandoned on the Island\
  \ of Naxos she was overcome with grief. Theseus has used her and broken his promise.\
  \ She could not go back to her home on Crete and in her grief she lept into the\
  \ waters below the Temple of Apollo. Dionysus, the God of wine, ecstasy, and theatre\
  \ had watched her in her grief and descended into the underworld to ask Hades aka\
  \ Pluto for her release. He was grated this and promoted her to Goddess status.\
  \ I felt this was my story. Time after time parents, lovers, and supposed friends\
  \ had promised home, stability, and protection in exchange for what they wanted\
  \ and needed only to leave and abandon me. What I realized was that really I was\
  \ abandoning myself. I was not setting and honoring my boundaries. During my trip\
  \ I came across an article that told a new story of Ariadne. It is thought she was\
  \ the great Goddess of the Minoan people. Her story had been altered when the sky\
  \ gods became more important to people and to keep her around she was paired with\
  \ Dionysus. But originally she was likely a priestess, mistress of the labyrinth,\
  \ serving the people from a place of honor. Through my journey from Crete to Naxos\
  \ to Athens, I began to set my boundaries and forgave myself,  recommitting to my\
  \ core values, principles, and dreams. Replacing my own soul expression in a place\
  \ of honor.  For me, stepping into the unknown provided clarity of what I knew on\
  \ a soul level."
