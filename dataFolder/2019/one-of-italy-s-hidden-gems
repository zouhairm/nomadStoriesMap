Text: "Approaching Treviso, the surroundings seem like the outskirts of any town,\
  \ nothing special. Be patient\u2026a magical city awaits you. Once you enter the\
  \ walled area of the old town your senses awaken and the charm and beauty overtake\
  \ you.\nWinding, cobblestone streets, dotted with cafes, tavernas and shops, lead\
  \ you from piazza to piazza, passing by churches and basilicas drenched in frescos\
  \ and beautiful stained glass windows.\nOnly 30km from Venice, Treviso is a star\
  \ in it\u2019s own right; the birthplace of Prosecco, Tiramisu, Casatella cheese\
  \ and famous for it\u2019s radicchio. The fashion houses Sisley and United Colours\
  \ of Benetton also hail from the city.\nTreviso is warm, vibrant and beautiful.\
  \ The immaculate streets and glistening canals wrap their way around the multitude\
  \ of galleries, markets and cafes. Urban modern art is scattered through out the\
  \ walls  and alcoves of the historic centre, contrasting sharply with the faded\
  \ frescoes still visible on the exteriors of the many Romanesque, Gothic and Venetian\
  \ style buildings.\nThe markets are a staple in the life of a Trevisan. People arrive\
  \ on foot and on bicycle to collect their goods and to socialize within the community.\
  \ The famous fish market is a bustling meeting place on Fish Island, held almost\
  \ everyday; fruit, antique and flea markets are held Tuesday and Saturday. \nSteeped\
  \ in history, one could spend days exploring Treviso but it would be impossible\
  \ to resist the temptation to visit the incredibly beautiful towns only a few kms\
  \ away. \n\nConegliano, 30 km north of Treviso, boats a 10th century castle and\
  \ is the birthplace of popular Prosecco, now becoming an integral hub for the cyclist.\
  \ The newly opened cycling trail from Munich to Venice is almost 600km long, linking\
  \ the Bavarian Alps to the Adriatic Sea. The Canon d\u2019Oro specifically caters\
  \ to the cyclist offering 10% off if you arrive with a bike. The hotel is equipped\
  \ with bike storage, a bike maintenance room and provides energy bars and other\
  \ incidentals needed to take to the road. Believe it or not, the stunning hotel,\
  \ complete with beautiful gardens, terraces and lovely frescos adorning it\u2019\
  s entranceway, is a Best Western Hotel.\n\nFollina is where you will find a 12th\
  \ century abbey just 35 km NW of Treviso . The beautiful olive trees grace the periphery\
  \ of the stunning and whimsical cloister within. After walking the cobblestone streets\
  \ , treat yourself to a luxurious dinner at Ristorante La Corte, one of the few\
  \ Michelin Star restaurants  in the area\n\nVittoria Veneto and Asolo with their\
  \ magnificent vistas are two of the most beautiful Gothic towns definitely worth\
  \ a visit. They both transport you back in time with their grand churches and castles,\
  \ narrow pedestrian roads and canals.\n\nFonte is for the Prosecco lover! Prosecco\
  \ vineyards sweep the Veneto region but it is here that you will find Dal Bello\
  \ vineyard and some of the best Prosecco ever tasted. Book a tour of the vineyard\
  \ and cellars then wander across the road to their tavern for a scrumptious lunch\n\
  \nTreviso is the ideal spot to use as a base for day trips not only these wonderful\
  \ towns but also Venice! Just a short 20 minute train ride from Treviso, one can\
  \ enjoy the excitement and energy of this incredible city without the expense and\
  \ often frustration of acquiring a hotel room.  The Adriatic Sea is also just 30\
  \ km away for those who like to dip their toes in the water or to walk the promenade.\
  \ With so much to do and see, Treviso is truly a place to return to over and over\
  \ again."
