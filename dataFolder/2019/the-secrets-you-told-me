Text: "You are 28 and a rebel. Divorced parents and violent grandparents with exceptional\
  \ intellectual last names. Oh Berlin. When you opened the door, your nose was powered,\
  \ and your jeans were ripped and the streaks of skin beneath them had ink black\
  \ figures. I was hypnotized by how your straight blue hair swung back and forth\
  \ with the entry of the subway. But once the yellow underground world opened up,\
  \ I snapped back, because I was in for an unrestricted, progressive, expressionist\
  \ ride where history was buried for everyone to see.\n\nYou had some secrets. What\
  \ did you cover up? You took me to the west side: A fire in a rusty barrel was the\
  \ front desk of an abandoned spy tower, on top of Teufelsberg (a man made-hill,\
  \ also called \u201CDevil\u2019s Mountain\u201D) there was a combination of Disney\xB4\
  s Epcot icon, TV towers and futuristic globes. Entering implied being at your own\
  \ risk. The geodesic spheres on top were actually what used to be one of the largest\
  \ listening stations of the US National Security Agency, supposedly part of a global\
  \ intelligence gathering network. But underneath it lied a 260 ft tall accumulation\
  \ of debris from war memoirs, and underneath that, an unfinished Nazi Military Technical\
  \ College. Now the abandoned buildings became more rubble on top of the hill, perfect\
  \ canvases for graffiti. We climbed up and you took a puff of glory smoke inside\
  \ a bathtub left behind, and planted a new flag.\n\nAfter travelling through stairs\
  \ and frozen colorful places on the insurgent summit with a spraying can in your\
  \ hand, you pushed me to the east and showed me a beautiful gallery of paintings\
  \ in a wall, or was it really another confession? Did we not see the genocide under\
  \ the mist or were we asleep when the concrete barrier rose? All nonsense and broken\
  \ glasses. Not innocent. Not me, not them, not you. Let the books never burn, let\u2019\
  s dance naked in gay clubs with last night\u2019s confetti from artists\u2019 project,\
  \ let\u2019s endeavor between east and west with a one euro frozen beer. Before\
  \ and after. Finally, you inserted a needle that left a trace of tattooed graffiti\
  \ in the middle of my chest, running through me at the pace of techno. Auf wiedersehen.\n\
  \nThey say you are the best city for millenials, you are 28 and a rebel."
