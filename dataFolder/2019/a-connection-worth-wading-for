  \ large tour group to the register. Next. \u201CCounter 2 is open.\u201D Next. Counter\
  \ 3 is open. \n\nAs we got closer and closer to the front of the line, I felt my\
  \ heart flutter; we would soon be dipping our toes in the 100-degree water\u2014\
  the water that I knew would at first sooth my achy muscles, and soon after, prune\
  \ my malleable skin. Next. It was our turn. Finally. Tagged with our bracelets-turned\
  \ locker keys, we were ready to experience the infamous Blue Lagoon. \n\nAfter stowing\
  \ away our valuables and rinsing ourselves off, we stepped onto the pool deck. The\
  \ first sight was breathtaking. The second\u2026was overwhelming. There were hundreds\
  \ of people, all wading around different pockets of the lagoon, getting face masks,\
  \ drinking cocktails, and posing for photos. Admittedly, I would soon be doing the\
  \ same. But as I watched them from a distance, I thought to myself, this couldn\u2019\
  t possibly be the best thing that Iceland has to offer. \n\nAnd to my delight, it\
  \ wasn\u2019t.  \n\nThe following day, we went on a hike. As we approached a steep\
  \ incline, I thought to myself, Next. Next. Next, with each step we took up the\
  \ mountain. We stumbled over rocks, crossed over creeks, and tested our limits as\
  \ we creeped to the edges of cliffs (leaving my mom very disgruntled). We came across\
  \ horses and goats and sheep and breathed in clean, crisp air. \n\nAs we walked\
  \ further through the grass and up the dirt hills, the air became clouded, and the\
  \ pungent smell of rotten eggs (otherwise known as sulfur) filled our nostrils.\
  \ We continued to walk until we got to a hot river that was safe enough to dip into.\
  \ Eagerly, I slung my bulky backpack off my shoulders, and stripped down to my bathing\
  \ suit; off came three layers of sweaters, one rain jacket, two layers of pants,\
  \ socks, gloves, a scarf, and a hat. I eased myself into the tepid water without\
  \ any worry as to how I would get all of my clothes back on after. \n\nI submerged\
  \ myself in the water and played my own version of Marco Polo as I searched for\
  \ the hottest spots in the river. I could feel my muscles relax, not just from the\
  \ water\u2019s temperature, but from the near magic I could feel surrounding me.\
  \ When I re-emerged, I could hear the sound of sheep baaaa-ing and feel the cold\
  \ air whip my exposed face. I watched as my skin began to wrinkle, indicating that\
  \ it was time to go. \n\nAs I made my way out of the water, the wind kissed my legs\
  \ in such a way that I could not be angry. And I realized then the connection that\
  \ I had made. \n\nI didn\u2019t make the connection with the cashier at the Blue\
  \ Lagoon or the waiter at the highly-acclaimed restaurant that my brother made reservations\
  \ for three months prior; I didn\u2019t make the connection with the host at our\
  \ Airbnb or the tour guide who took us snowmobiling. \n\nI made the connection with\
  \ the country, with the land, and of course, with the goats. And I realized then,\
  \ those were the most important connections I could have made.\n\nBecause without\
  \ connecting with the places you visit, without having the appetite to indulge in\
  \ the unknown, without acknowledging your privilege and uninhibitedly embracing\
  \ the local experience, why travel?"
