Text: "Weren\u2019t you scared of riding a scooter? Waiting in the night rainfall\
  \ along the highway? Sleeping in a beat-up hostel on the lost Daskalakis Street?\
  \ Climbing a craggy mountain and swimming to \u201Cthose fa-ar stones\u201D? Saying\
  \ YES as an expression of sensibility, not sense? Crete for me meant making a step\
  \ to the adventure again and again. I listened to my heart to hear: \u201CNo fear\u201D\
  . \nLet it go and let it be. Grab your sneakers with a barely wet swimsuit and go\
  \ exploring the west. Make a start from lifelike Malia to businesslike Heraklion\
  \ and from Heraklion to dreamlike Rethymno. Welcome the city with friendly \u201C\
  \u0393\u03B5\u03B9\u03B1 \u03C3\u03BF\u03C5t\u201D and run to a sun-drenched beach.\
  \ Eat your sandwiches covered in salty sea spray and feel at home. Admire the city\
  \ skyline from enigmatic Fortezza. Enjoy! \n...Come aboard and set off for exotic\
  \ Balos lagoon. The view of turquoise and vivid blue water is fantastic! Hide your\
  \ passport deeper and cross the lake. Act, it\u2019s shallow! Save yourself from\
  \ heavy rain crowding under the single umbrella on the area. Has it cracked?! Hold\
  \ the edges better and try to survive. Laugh! \n...Find rocky paths and head to\
  \ the mountains. The higher you go the farther you see. Even multicoloured sea!\
  \ (Everybody encouraged by nature becomes a little bit poets) Get off the wide roads\
  \ to watch something \u201Cauthentic\u201D. Take a stroll in the olive grove in\
  \ Sissi, rest on the step of a narrow Neapolis street, come in tiny churches and\
  \ have a cup of coffee in tavernas uptown. Open up!\n...Get acquainted with the\
  \ locals and tourists. Be \"Russian lady\" or \u201CRussian mafia tratatatatata\u201D\
  \ and have fun. Lie on the beach and let your skin feel hot rough sand. Dance in\
  \ the clubs, in your hotel and on the street. Taste spicy moussaka, delicate Dorado\
  \ and savory tzatziki. Use familiar words and \u03BC\u03B9\u03BB\u03BF\u03CD\u03BD\
  \ \u03B5\u03BB\u03BB\u03B7\u03BD\u03B9\u03BA\u03AC that means \"speak Greek\u201D\
  . Go on a date with the most handsome guy in Crete (correction, in Greece!). Even\
  \ if your plane takes off in three hours. Live! \nUnreasonable risks give reasonable\
  \ pleasure. Only one rule to follow - NO FEAR. No matter you or your companion says\
  \ it. But telling the truth...the second option is a million times better!"
