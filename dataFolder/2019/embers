Text: "My mother likes to tell stories, especially those of when she was young and\
  \ travelled through India.\nAmong her favourites is the one about the time she parted\
  \ from her travel group, which was going to see the Taj Mahal, and followed a huge\
  \ crowd of people instead.\n\nShe likes to tell it as the story of \"The time I\
  \ went to the funeral of Indira Gandhi without intending to\".\nIt's a classic,\
  \ never gets old.\n\nNow it's March 2019 and we've been travelling through Japan\
  \ for the past two weeks, together with a friend of hers.\nThe age piramide goes:\
  \ 31 - 55 - 65, with my mother on the top.\n\nIt's been quite tiring, I have to\
  \ admit it, but when I started to plan a trip to Japan and thought of her, last\
  \ summer, I knew this was probably going to be the last time she'd accept to do\
  \ such a long trip on such a faraway land and I decided to give her a chance of\
  \ making a wish come true.\n\nShe's been dreaming about the Japanese culture since\
  \ I gave her a collection of ha\xEFkus  on her 49th birthday.\n\n16 years later\
  \ we finally made it, and arrived at the Nara JR station with the 4:03 regional\
  \ train from Kyoto.\n\nWe barely had the time to leave our luggage at the Airbnb\
  \ and buy our bento at the minimarket (which the locals call konbini) that our clock\
  \ was already ticking.\n\nI told everyone that the takeaway meals were on 50% discount\
  \ after 6pm, so we went crazy on the sushi, and we hit the road to the Todai-ji\
  \ temple with my backpack full of groceries.\n\nThe special ceremony that we were\
  \ hoping to attend is called Omizutori, and it is said to be quite spectacular:\
  \ the monks light up fires and move them along the perimeter of the temple, having\
  \ hundreds of embers falling down to the crowd.\n\nWatching the embers attracts\
  \ good luck for the whole year and the ceremony is extremely popular. \nSo popular\
  \ that we found ourselves walking alongside a Japanese girl who painfully told us\
  \ we wouldn't see a thing.\nWhich proved to be right.\n\nThe whole event was extremely\
  \ well organised; we weren't though, and we weren't the only ones.\nUnorganised\
  \ tourists from in-Land and out-Land gathered at the bottom of the temple.\n\nWe\
  \ were all cueing and freezing; looking in the same direction; trying to perceive\
  \ something and get an idea of what was happening up there (the Todai-ji is a huge\
  \ complex on the top of a hill), and a series of obstacles were standing between\
  \ us and the object of our curiosity - just like in a videogame - obstructing the\
  \ view.\n\nI, for instance, had found a spot to direct my eyes between a tree, a\
  \ warning sign about deers - typically drown in a funny way - and an informative\
  \ board I couldn't possibly understand.\nLuckily for me, I'm tall.\n\nTwo persons\
  \ approached: a father and a daughter.\nShe was surely in her fifties and the man\
  \ must have been at least 80 years old.\nHe was holding a compact camera - an old\
  \ model - tenaciously trying to take a picture of the temple.\nNow, not only were\
  \ the pictures too dark, he was also too small to place the camera above the fence\
  \ that we were facing, and so was she.\n\n\"Kumenasai\", I started, \"would you\
  \ like me to take a picture for you?\" \nThey were both very happy. \nTo my great\
  \ surprise, the woman replied in a very good English.\nI'd met a university teacher\
  \ of British history from a Japanese town I'd never heard before. \n\nHer father\
  \ slowly raised his hands above his head and freed his neck from the lanyard that\
  \ attached him to the camera.\nI took a few pictures for him and gave the camera\
  \ back.\nShe smiled at me.\n\n\"Do you know what's going to happen?\"\n\"No,\" she\
  \ said \"we're here for the first time.\nI wanted my father to see it.\nAre you\
  \ travelling alone?\" \n\"No,\" I answered \"I came with my mum.\"\n\nShe gave me\
  \ her card and the crowd moved.\n\n\"Oyasumine\".\nHave a good night."
