Text: "Going to Malawi for the first time at the age of sixteen was a real eye-opener.\
  \ The bumpy roads, shoeless passerby's, naked children, crippled beggars, mud-huts\
  \ and hanging animal carcasses - all seemed to be quite like I had expected. I certainly\
  \ enjoyed my stay and took in the experience. But in the third-world, much of life\
  \ is imbued with suffering. \nOne of the most painful memories of my life to date\
  \ was walking through the hospital in the town of Ntcheo. It was an open room, full\
  \ of the ill and dying (and I'm sure the already dead). No proper walkways, no curtains\
  \ for privacy \u2013 In a haze, I walked through the maze of people, a feeling that\
  \ only embodied suffering can afflict on the heart. Sick people crammed together,\
  \ some on beds, some on mattresses, and many on the cold floor. After visiting a\
  \ few of the patients with my family, seeing the struggle and the sorrow, I was\
  \ overwhelmed with grief, and I had to leave - holding back tears as I went outside\
  \ to catch my breath. \nOn my second trip to Malawi, my Dad devised a plan for just\
  \ the two of us to do something unique together. Early one morning, we woke up before\
  \ the rest and set off with our driver and translator, Julius, to the market. My\
  \ dad was quite the haggler but wanted to share his spoils - we bought big sacks\
  \ of corn from various vendors, but he wasn't willing to be made a fool. Often walking\
  \ away from vendors who would ask for far too much. My dad refused to do business\
  \ with those who looked to take advantage of others. When the crowd saw what we\
  \ were doing things got a little overwhelming. We became surrounded by vendors hoping\
  \ to sell large amounts of corn to these rich, white men, who seemed to be buying\
  \ far too much. He and Julius kept the mob at bay, while I loaded the van, and we\
  \ made it out with a few hundred pounds of corn and some anxious laughter.\nWe travelled\
  \ down the road a way, where my dad got Julius to pull over. The two of us grabbed\
  \ a couple of sacks each and started walking into the thicket. after about five\
  \ minutes of walking, we found ourselves in a small village made of mud and straw.\
  \ Naked children and topless women anxiously backed away, so we stopped. A large,\
  \ older-man emerged - the chief of the community. It seemed I was just as anxious\
  \ and curious as the women and children, as the two men looked intently at one another.\
  \ With no words exchanged, at my father's lead, I put down the sacks of corn from\
  \ off my shoulders, backed off and walked back with him to the vehicle. Arriving\
  \ back to the family, my father received a fair amount of grief over our impromptu\
  \ expedition. Everyone was surprisingly upset! I guess it was warranted - leaving\
  \ without telling them and coming back far later than we had hoped. But I remember\
  \ seeing the look of content on my father\u2019s face, experiencing our own little\
  \ taste of Africa, an adventure just for us, father and son.\nMy third trip to Malawi\
  \ was just myself and my Grandfather, Papa-D. The agenda was to oversee the drilling\
  \ of two new wells. The first being a well drilled in honor of my recently deceased\
  \ father. He had such a heart for the people in the village of Ntcheo, and it feels\
  \ good knowing that not only did he touch the lives of so many people there while\
  \ he was alive, but also that the well drilled in his name continues to provide\
  \ fresh water for those who desperately need it. After my dad's passing, my mother\
  \ found solace in collecting heart-shaped rocks and making crafts out of them. As\
  \ Papa-D engraved the fresh concrete of my father\u2019s new well, I took one of\
  \ her rock\u2019s that I had packed and hid it in the rafters of the orphanage just\
  \ steps away from. I hope the next time I visit, I will see it right there where\
  \ I left it."
