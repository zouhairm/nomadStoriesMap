Text: "I strolled through the maze of the Fes medina, entranced by every smell, every\
  \ sound, the wonder of which stall or merchant would be around the next corner.\
  \ Tired but excited, I arrived at my riad, a beautiful house whose unassuming door\
  \ was hidden beside a small grocer; upon entering, it presented an ornate green\
  \ tiled entrance hall and reception room, where I received the warmest welcome of\
  \ mint tea and spiced cookies. I was in awe of the splendour of the mosaics, the\
  \ banners which lined the walls, complementing the heavy doors speckled with gold\
  \ and elaborate carvings. I settled into my bed that night, feeling full of the\
  \ delicious lamb tagine and sumptuous chicken pastilla I enjoyed on a quiet veranda\
  \ overlooking the twinkling medina, strangely sombre despite the flurry of activities\
  \ hidden in the city beneath.\nThe next morning, refreshed and ready for the day\
  \ ahead, I enjoyed breakfast on the riad rooftop terrace. It was a beautiful sunny\
  \ day, with the Atlas Mountains providing a glorious backdrop and the sounds drifting\
  \ up inviting me to explore this ancient city. The first stop of the day was to\
  \ the Madrasa of Al-Karaouine, a stunning yet modest structure which is the oldest\
  \ operating university in the world, followed by a trip to the Chouara Tannery.\
  \ The sights of large stone vats filled with colourful dyes was fascinating, as\
  \ I observed men working fiercely in the midday sun as they soaked animal hides,\
  \ clutching at my bunch of mint leaves so that the odours did not impair my enjoyment!\n\
  The rest of my day consisted of sampling the delights that Fes had to offer in its\
  \ souks; the most lavish dates and pastries, tea and succulent meat, occasionally\
  \ hopping aside as cries of \u2018BELEK!\u2019 indicating heavily-laden donkeys\
  \ advancing through the narrow streets. The marvels of the spice souk were next,\
  \ as the aromatic scents tickled my nostrils, a new fragrance wafting from every\
  \ doorway and stall, amber pyramids of spices adorning every surface as merchants\
  \ haggled for the best price. I filled up on sweet-smelling herbs and spices, tart\
  \ green tea leaves and luxurious Argan oil. I browsed the beautiful blankets handmade\
  \ by Berbers, resilient enough for the harsh desert but soft enough to lay down\
  \ and fall into a peaceful slumber. After much deliberation I selected an emerald\
  \ green blanket, embellished with a simple white and black diamond in the center,\
  \ and tastefully adorned with matching tassels and patterned diamond trim. My final\
  \ stop was to one of the many leather merchants, where I marveled at the remarkable\
  \ quality of the inexpensive sandals and satchels I purchased \u2013 the shopkeeper\
  \ insisted I sit and have some mint tea, reinforcing the warm and exceptional hospitality\
  \ I had indulged in since I arrived.\nEventually my growling stomach directed me\
  \ towards the tempting smells of the food market. One soup kitchen drew my attention\
  \ as I noticed a single white round table behind the vendor, appealing to my aching\
  \ legs from my day\u2019s rambling. As I settled down to enjoy my steaming bowl\
  \ of harira soup, I was joined by an elderly couple, who spoke little French but\
  \ enough to welcome me to Morocco which warmed me more than the soup I was devouring.\
  \ The quiet was broken only by the sounds of us relishing our food, distance sounds\
  \ of the bustling market and efforts to converse until our valiant attempts were\
  \ abandoned. As we finished our meal, the elderly gentleman took out a brown paper\
  \ bag from the inside pocket of his weathered coat, though crumpled I could see\
  \ it was full. He offered the bag to me with a smile which I was delighted to see\
  \ was full of little almond pastries. I graciously accepted, and we continued to\
  \ sit in a comfortable silence as I savored this treat and the delights of the market\
  \ around me until I thanked them and went on my way. This was the moment which I\
  \ remember fondly, when I shared a meal with two strangers, who made me feel so\
  \ welcome without needing to speak the same language. It summarized the kind nature\
  \ of the Moroccan people which made my trip so special."
