Text: "\u201CWhat part of Thailand are our students from, again?\u201D I asked Ken.\
  \ \n\n\u201CThey\u2019re not from Thailand, they\u2019re from Burma.\u201D He replied\
  \ in a distracted, busied manner refusing to call the country by its new name, Myanmar.\
  \ He was director of a nonprofit in Thailand that I was working for, and running\
  \ programs in several other Southeast Asian countries.\n\n\u201CThere are schools\
  \ in Myanmar, right? Why would they need to come here to study?\u201D I asked, perplexed\
  \ by their situation.\n\n\u201CThey\u2019ll come here to study because their social\
  \ status in their home country doesn\u2019t allow for education.\u201D He replied\
  \ gruffly, a bitterness in his tone that only comes from years of the hard realities\
  \ within the nonprofit sector. \n\n*\n\nThis conversation led to me sitting in the\
  \ bed of a rickety, but sturdy, old truck alongside two of my students, Hsa Khu\
  \ Wa and Moo Nay Pa. It was the beginning of summer term, and I was headed to Myanmar,\
  \ to experience the living conditions of my students for myself. Although I understood\
  \ that my students were from an extremely oppressed tribe, my endless questioning\
  \ to Ken seemed only solve-able through a first hand experience. After some convincing,\
  \ he was willing to let me see the conditions for myself. \n\nThe sun nearly baked\
  \ us as we traveled farther away from the border of Thailand into the heart of a\
  \ wild, unknown land. I quickly learned that roads here were a privilege, not a\
  \ standard, as we crossed rocky desert scapes and drove straight into rushing rivers.\
  \ I was glad to touch the bare ground when we arrived to the hometown village of\
  \ my students. Could this be it? I wondered, looking around. I was expecting a village,\
  \ whereas this was a mere cluster of huts along the bank of a river. \n\n\u201C\
  You will stay in best house in village.\u201D Hsa Khu Wa smiled. She ushered me\
  \ inside a hut, and giggled embarrassedly at her own English. There was a small\
  \ man to greet me, with his tiny wife, both adorning wide smiles. Their teeth were\
  \ black and mouths blood red from chewing betel nuts, a habit of most locals. \n\
  \nAfter quickly getting settled, Hsa Khu Wa and Moo Nay Paw ushered me to their\
  \ \"most beautiful place\", warning me to stick closely to them on the path to avoid\
  \ the land mines still buried in the terrain around us. I gulped hard, and mimicked\
  \ their steps precisely. We arrived at the bank of a dirty river, and they scampered\
  \ up a tree as naturally as I would have walked up a flight of steps. \n\n\"Come\
  \ up here, teacher!\" they summoned, laughing. \n\nAfter a small struggle, I found\
  \ a low branch to perch on. I followed their wistful gazes to the scenery below,\
  \ and beheld a different view than what I saw reflected in their eyes. Trash floated\
  \ with the current towards the village families who were downstream bathing and\
  \ beating their clothing against the river rocks. I felt suddenly small then, and\
  \ quite embarrassed at my disbelief at the severe poverty of their circumstance.\
  \ School children sang in the distance in angelic tones as I observed their \"most\
  \ beautiful place\". It was ravaged, cherished, and mysterious; it was a beautiful\
  \ hell.    \n\n*\n\nAfter a single day, my strength started to dwindle. The smiles\
  \ on the faces of the villagers and the pureness of their spirits made me want to\
  \ push through, to win against the climate fighting against me. I lay through the\
  \ wicked heat of the days and shivered through the chill of nights, eating what\
  \ I could to try and regain my strength. On the fourth day, I awoke vomiting. \n\
  \nHsa Khu Wa ran out behind me, \"Teacher, you alright?\"\n\n\"I am completely fine,\"\
  \ I said in a weak voice. \n\nHer face was set and determined. \"No, we go back\
  \ to school. We must get you back to school.\" \n\nI was loaded back into the bed\
  \ of a truck, defeated. The mind may be ready for things that the body is not, I\
  \ realized. Myanmar had spit me out, leaving my questions unanswered, and my experience\
  \ half done. Too soon, we tend to forge into places unknown."
