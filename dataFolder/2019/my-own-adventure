Text: "I had always been fascinated by my parents' stories about parts of our country\
  \ that seemed taken out of a fairy tale. It appeared as though they saw something\
  \ that I couldn't, something hidden beneath the concrete. Our country was transformed\
  \ by their words, and I listened in awe as they modeled it, playing with words the\
  \ way one would play with clay. I grew up listening to stories about mountain tops\
  \ and meadows, and when time finally came to have my first trip alone with my friends\
  \ I was ready to thread my own story. \nThe adventure begun when a few of my friends\
  \ asked me to join them in an attempt to explore a remote village in the Cerna mountains,\
  \ near Baile Herculane city. We embarked on the train with heavy backpacks and a\
  \ head full of dreams, following the same path our parents followed about ten years\
  \ ago, ready for our own adventure. We started climbing near Cerna river, slowly\
  \ but surely nearing Prisacina village. As we grew tired, we spotted a small cottage.\
  \ A nice old man opened the door and welcomed us into his humble abode. He offered\
  \ us pancakes, the best cheese I ever had, a glass of water and a place to set up\
  \ our tents for the night. They ran the only mill the village had, a still-functioning,\
  \ old-fashioned water mill, a delight for us to see, as they have become quite rare\
  \ after the communist regime was established in our country. \nThe next morning,\
  \ we said goodbye to our kind saviors, and set out to conquer the Arjana mountain\
  \ top. It was a two-day trip, but another villager accepted to be paid in our traditional\
  \ beverage, tzuica, for a one-night stay on his land. We became much more united\
  \ after all those days when we had to stay together, cook and talk. Early in the\
  \ morning, followed by a new addition to our group, a dog cleverly named Caine (the\
  \ romanian word for dog), we started our journey towards Arjana. We seemed to be\
  \ surrounded by fields of blueberries, which prolonged the trip with about two hours,\
  \ as everyone stopped to eat some once every three steps. \nAfter an arduous four\
  \ hours, sweetened by the wild blueberries, we got to the top. Everything seemed\
  \ so small. The wind was blowing so hard that ot made you think that spreading your\
  \ hands would make you fly away. I felt on top of the world. Standing there with\
  \ my friends, singing songs that not even we could hear because of the wind, I understood\
  \ why my parents' stories seemed so out of this world. There is something about\
  \ the hidden parts of a country, the parts that live in the past and haven't even\
  \ heard of concrete, that makes it that much more valuable, and I'm so glad I realized\
  \ just how valuable my country is."
