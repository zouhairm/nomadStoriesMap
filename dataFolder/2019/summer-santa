Text: "I always loved Christmas time. It seems like the perfect opportunity to make\
  \ great decisions, expect the unexpected and discover some truths about ourselves.\
  \ For me, this holiday always comes with a bright sunny day, with something around\
  \ a 39\xBAC degrees wave of heat and lots of ice cream. As a brazilian girl born\
  \ and raised around the coast area of S\xE3o Paulo, Christmas was never like those\
  \ holiday movies from the US. \nHowever, in the second semester of 2016, I was in\
  \ a exchange program in Portugal. With the predictions of a stone cold winter and\
  \ the thought of my first holiday away from home, I couldn't be happy for Christmas.\
  \ All I wanted was to get my traditions back, along with my parents and friends.\
  \ \nMy roommate saw me crying at lunch and stopped to see what was wrong. As I shared\
  \ some of those insecurities, she looked deep into my eyes and burst into laughing:\
  \ \"do you want summer? Okay. Stop worrying and pack your stuff. We'll go after\
  \ it\". She went online and started searching through Couchsurfing, looking for\
  \ a place to crush on Christmas' eve. \nI immediately thought this was a bad idea.\
  \ I mean, who would open their house for two strangers? Specially on Christmas?\
  \ We were at Coimbra, and she was looking for places everywhere. Suddenly, we were\
  \ sending messages to hosts at Lisbon. As we did it, I kept thinking to myself:\
  \ \"how the hell she's planning to bring back summertime?\"\nWe had other three\
  \ brazilian and one european friend alone and sad about Christmas. As they heard\
  \ about our little expedition to chase the summer, they reunited with us and helped\
  \ looking for a place to stay. We were all into Couchsurfing and Facebook' groups,\
  \ talking to every possible host who was available to receive us.\nAfter one day,\
  \ we received three replies: Leslie, a canadian girl who was receiving guests at\
  \ her Airbnb at Lisbon, politely declined by conflict of dates; Jorge, a portuguese\
  \ student at the Catholic University of Lisbon, was at the United States by our\
  \ travel time; the last one was Roberto, who told us to call him by his phone.\n\
  As we spoke, Roberto just wanted to know how many of us were coming and how far\
  \ were we. He was 100% right about hosting us, but his concerns were more about\
  \ the logistics of our trip. He managed to skip work earlier and took us at the\
  \ bus station at Lisbon, by December 23rd. As we met, we immediately bonded like\
  \ seven strangers who were about to spent the most familiar holiday together would\
  \ never imagine.\nBut his house wasn't exactly on Lisbon. Roberto's home was in\
  \ Costa da Caparica, a coast city that was 16km far from it. As we took our places\
  \ in his cars - he drove one and his mother drove the other -, we could feel the\
  \ cold slipping away from us as we went by the road. The picture of the sun setting\
  \ down by the mountains was breathtaking, and all we could feel inside was a great\
  \ heat coming up around our cheeks. \nWe spent the most amazing three days at Roberto's.\
  \ Besides getting us to surfing lessons and teaching us how to drive motorcycles,\
  \ Roberto took care of everything and made us feel lile home by Christmas' Eve.\
  \ We celebrated it with a big supper, reuniting around the table with all of his\
  \ family. As a special treat, they made us some brazilian desserts, just to be sure\
  \ that everyone could feel like home.\nEven in a 10 hour distance by plane of my\
  \ hometown, I could put my feet on the sand and watch one of the most spectacular\
  \ sunsets I had ever seen in that Christmas. As for Roberto, we remained friends\
  \ ever since, never forgeting to send our best wishes every holiday. \nIn the 25th,\
  \ I wore my special Christmas hat and a red dress. In the words of my european friend,\
  \ in that day I was Summer Santa. And from that weekend on, I never quit chasing\
  \ the sun everywhere I go around any season. Even the froasting places may have\
  \ the warmest sunsets."
