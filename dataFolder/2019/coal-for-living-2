Text: "Coal for living is a short documentary about Subsistence coal mining, climate\
  \ change, environmental rights, struggle against poverty and unemployment in Mpumalanga\
  \ South Africa. According to statistics Mpumalanga produce more than 80% of the\
  \ total amount of coal in South Africa. Indigenous energy resources base is dominated\
  \ by coal, about 77% of South Africa\u2019s primary energy needs are provided by\
  \ coal. \n\nMpumalanga is also home to eleven coal power stations that are providing\
  \ electricity for South Africa. The power stations have a devastating and lasting\
  \ impact on the environment and the health of local people. Mining licenses are\
  \ granted by the South African government on the condition that mines follow strictly\
  \ defined Environmental Rehabilitation and Social Development Plans, which are meant\
  \ to safeguard the ecology and allow local people to benefit from the mineral wealth\
  \ of the country.\n\nIllegal mining cost South Africa R5bn per year, even though\
  \ it could be argued that informal mining pre-date formalized industrial mining\
  \ as we know it today, and that illegal miners, just like subsistence farmers in\
  \ South Africa\u2019s rural villages and townships, are simply continuing a culture\
  \ that has existed for many thousands of years. \n\nA community of Wesselton Mpumalanga\
  \ defied the public image of illegal miners as ragged, gun-toting men ready to kill\
  \ at any time. Men and women continuing subsistence mining culture by digging for\
  \ coal, working long hours a day and earn between R500 and R1500 per shift, risking\
  \ their life\u2019s to put bread on a table for their families. \n\nThrough a series\
  \ of on scene footage and interviews with prominent figures in the South African\
  \ climate change, Center for environmental rights, government officials and community\
  \ members who are benefiting from this subsistence mining operation, We hear characters\
  \ share their personal stories, speaking passionately about climate change, environmental\
  \ rights, hard work and anticipation, heartbreak, fear, and hope. Although deeply\
  \ saddened, the\ncommunity\u2019s spirit was not shaken. We follow two community\
  \ elders who are the main artisanal behind operation. We also interview environmental\
  \ rights activist, we find out how much harm subsistence coal mining does to environment.\
  \ We also tell story of coal power stations and their contribution to global climate\
  \ change and the havoc they wreak in Mpumalanga itself which was one of the hardest\
  \ hit during the droughts of 2015/2016 which provides water for most of the interior\
  \ of South Africa. The aim of this project is to look at both the macro issues like\
  \ pollution, poverty and climate change while also personalizing the experience\
  \ of the local people who are on the front lines of this crisis and provide us with\
  \ a glimpse of what the future could be like for the country and indeed the SADC\
  \ region if this problem continues unchecked."
