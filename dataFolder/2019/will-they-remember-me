Text: "I step out of the airconditioned building through the sliding glass doors and\
  \ a wall of evening heat hits me. Sweat. Summer. Memories. A foreign land. Home.\
  \ It is all there, in the evening air. A friend was going to pick me up from the\
  \ airport, but he got ill. A girl who was on my flight is being picked up by her\
  \ boyfriend. They need to go to a different place and their car is already full,\
  \ yet they offer to help me. Her boyfriend is a local, a Nica, and discusses the\
  \ taxi fare with the driver since they tend to overcharge tourists. Eventually,\
  \ I get in a taxi and drive the 40 minutes from Managua to Granada, Nicaragua\u2019\
  s colourful cultural capital. The windows are open, the radio is on quietly, I chat\
  \ to the driver about his life, there is a slight wind in the lush trees outside.\
  \ I lean back in my seat. The sounds, the streets in the dark, the feeling of the\
  \ air \u2013 all of it is familiar. Very much like the first time I came here. \n\
  \nThe next morning, I take a stroll around town. Again, the feeling of familiarity\
  \ is overwhelmingly present. The colourful houses and jewellery stalls on the main\
  \ street. The crumbling houses and stray dogs on the side streets. The yellow chicken\
  \ buses. The Donkey-drawn carriages. The lake. The plantain chips and sour mango\
  \ slices. I was a little bit afraid to come back, but now I can\u2019t help but\
  \ feel at home. I sit at the Parque Central and watch the people. Vendors and their\
  \ children. Backpackers. Workers on their lunch break. I breathe it all in and try\
  \ to capture the moment. I want to take this moment and lock it into a marmalade\
  \ jar which I can open and smell on days that I am feeling less well. I decide to\
  \ get a passion fruit-orange-banana smoothie at the Garden Caf\xE9 (my favourite),\
  \ where I sit in one of their hammocks. The water softly runs down the fountain\
  \ in the middle of the little garden. The ceiling vents cause a light stream of\
  \ fresh air. I decide that it is time. \n\nI start walking away from the beautiful\
  \ city centre of Granada. Through the local market, across the bridge over the river\
  \ full of trash. Past an incredibly tasty comedor (a street food restaurant). I\
  \ am confident that I can still find the way to Education Plus, a project I used\
  \ to volunteer at that gives children from one of the poorest neighbourhoods in\
  \ Nicaragua better educational opportunities, a daily lunch, and a safe place to\
  \ be at. It is around noon. The sun is in zenith and it is hot. The houses get smaller.\
  \ The streets scruffier. The trash more. The tourists less. While I am a little\
  \ nervous, I enjoy my walk. I take a left, then a right. I should be passing a car\
  \ paintery soon. Very soon. I think the car paintery should have come up by now.\
  \ Maybe it was right then left, not left then right? I am suddenly unsure of where\
  \ exactely I am. Definitely in the middle of El Pantanal, Granada\u2019s \"slum\"\
  . The few people I pass by look at me, confused. Two girls come up to me shouting:\
  \ \u201Cchela, chela, que haces aqu\xED? Sos voluntaria? Es peligroso! Ven, te acompanamos\
  \ a la escuelita.\u201D \u2013 \u201Cwhite girl, what are you doing here? Are you\
  \ a volunteer? It\u2019s dangerous. Come, we\u2019ll accompany you to the little\
  \ school.\u201D I don\u2019t know these girls. But, honestly, I am quite happy they\
  \ found me and offered their help. As we walk I realise that I was definitely lost.\
  \ I had never walked this way before. Even though my Spanish is a little rusty,\
  \ we chat until we reach the school. I enter through the gates in the bright red\
  \ concrete walls that separate the school from its surroundings. There are many\
  \ faces I don\u2019t know. I stand there, lost, for a few seconds, in the tumultuous\
  \ routine of the school. Then I spot some faces I know. Children come running up\
  \ to me, hugging me. I hear my name being shouted. They remember me."
