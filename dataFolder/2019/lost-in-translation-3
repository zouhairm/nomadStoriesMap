Text: "It happened three years ago, but it feels like yesterday. Really \u2013 it\
  \ is still on my mind almost every day. This is a story about the good things in\
  \ life. But not in general \u2013 finding love, being happy, becoming a parent.\
  \ This is a story about the small gestures in our lives. Some of us haven\u2019\
  t seen them for a long time. \nHave you tried to go out of your comfort zone lately?\
  \ I push myself sometimes. Just to test myself. And it works. Always and everywhere.\
  \ \nThe year is 2016 \u2013 the place is \u2026 strange. I could say that is in\
  \ the middle of nowhere. No, too much. I was on an Erasmus + Project in Hungary\
  \ for two weeks. It was a training course, connected to soft skills and developing\
  \ relationships between people in the community. One of the activities was outdoor\
  \ training for three days. But it was not so simple. There was a small secret. We\
  \ were alone in the forest. For three days. Without mobile phones, without money,\
  \ without food or water. There was also good news \u2013 I was not alone. There\
  \ were four people in a team. But again, a little secret \u2013 we were from completely\
  \ different countries. So no Bulgarians. We were obliged to talk in English. Cool,\
  \ hm? I was not prepared for such an adventure. No one was\u2026\nWhat shall we\
  \ do? What are we going to eat? Will we survive?\nIt was somewhere between four\
  \ or five Hungarian villages. Of course, the people there could not speak English.\
  \ What did we expect? Imagine if your old relatives in the Rhodopi mountain were\
  \ fluent in English. Can\u2019t believe it!\nWe started with a scandal in the team.\
  \ Typical for Bulgarian, Greek, Turkish and Portuguese people. And of course, we\
  \ did not make an effective strategy how to handle the situation. An hour later\
  \ we started to make serious suggestions what exactly we can do in the hopeless\
  \ situation. We started with simple conversations with the local people. Have you\
  \ ever tried to explain in the languages you know? Also, by showing some pictures\
  \ or using hand gestures. Yes, it is extremely funny. Not so helpful in every situation.\
  \ But the information was not enough. Where were the food and the place for the\
  \ night? \nI absolutely did not expect it to happen so quickly. I can say now, years\
  \ later \u2013 \u201CThat escalated quickly\u2026\u201D I think some real angels\
  \ came to help us. With almost everything. \nWhile we were arguing on the street\
  \ of a small village, an old woman just approached us and invited us to lunch. So\
  \ strange \u2013 she even could not understand what exactly we were talking about.\
  \ She made us sandwiches with natural and fresh butter from milk, goat cheese and\
  \ jelly. She had also picked for us tomatoes from her garden. It was the most delicious\
  \ lunch in my entire life. Their language is so difficult for me. I really tried\
  \ to understand and to say a word for the two weeks on the project. Of course \u2013\
  \ it was a mission impossible. \nWhy have we stopped being good to people we don\u2019\
  t know? Why do we forget about the feelings of others ? That story brings more hope\
  \ for the future than many social or environment causes."
