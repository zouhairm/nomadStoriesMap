Text: "Everything this far north seems to grasp the concept of survival of the fittest;\
  \ the hardy people, the animals, the pine trees that flash past our windows, each\
  \ one growing a prolific cluster of pine cones bigger than the last. Tiny towns\
  \ sit like exclamation points to the long, run-on sentences of wilderness between\
  \ them.\n\nClay and I alternate driving and napping as we speed north on the Alaska\
  \ Highway. We stretch our legs in Watson Lake, wandering through thousands of stolen\
  \ street signs and license plates nailed up on posts by visitors around the globe.\
  \ A neon orange BUMP sign, Entering Yakima, three handmade signs stacked on top\
  \ of each other: Sin Not. Obey Jesus. Repent. \n\n\"We were here,\" the signs say.\
  \ \"Remember us.\" It\u2019s an easy emotion to understand. I\u2019ve felt myself\
  \ shrinking in comparison to the landscape. We nail a Wyoming license plate into\
  \ the chaos and roll on. \n\nLong stretches of the Alaska Highway are built right\
  \ across the permafrost. In the Yukon, the road sinks, swells and cracks. The trailer\
  \ we\u2019re pulling catches air once or twice before I begrudgingly slow our Toyota\
  \ down. \n \nFinally, we hug and kiss in the midnight dusk, elated to have reached\
  \ Alaska at last. But the celebration doesn\u2019t last even a quarter mile. Something\
  \ doesn\u2019t sound right.  \n\nOur rental trailer has a flat and it didn\u2019\
  t come with a spare. Most trailers won\u2019t be drug 3000 miles over bad roads\
  \ at ninety miles an hour. Cell service is non-existent. We nurse the trailer back\
  \ up the hill to the border station where we\u2019re told gruffly to use the pay\
  \ phone and no, absolutely not, you cannot park here for the night.  \n\nWe pitch\
  \ our tent in a turnout down the road from the border and fall asleep in the mud.\
  \ Eight hours later, a we\u2019re back on the road with a new Canadian tire. Two\
  \ hours after that, the other trailer tire blows. This time, we miraculously have\
  \ cell service. Two Alaskans in an 80\u2019s sedan bring another spare. One man\
  \ jacks the trailer, loosening the lug nuts while diving into a terse monologue.\
  \ \n\n\"If you\u2019re unprepared out here, you\u2019re gonna die. You aren\u2019\
  t in Wyoming anymore. Bring a damn spare when you travel and stop wasting other\
  \ people\u2019s time.\" We listen humbly before explaining that we\u2019re headed\
  \ to Anchorage for a new start. \n\nThe man bent over the tire snorts but doesn\u2019\
  t look up from his work. \u201CAnchorage. That place is full of scum suckers.\u201D\
  \ We\u2019re relieved when his irritation  turns on Alaskan politicians instead\
  \ of us. Still, we\u2019re left assuming we must be scum suckers too. \n \nGentleness\
  \ seems to be worth little this far north. But now I understand, grit is something\
  \ you won\u2019t survive without."
