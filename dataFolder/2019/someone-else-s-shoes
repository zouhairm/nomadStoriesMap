Text: "We had already been on the island of enchantment for three day, and with the\
  \ sun on our shoulders and red hibiscus in our hair, my three girl friends and I\
  \ were pleased to find that Puerto Rico lived up to its nickname. To our surprise\
  \ we had really not seen much evidence that hurricane Maria had torn through here\
  \ eight months prior to our arrival other than some trees down or a few building\
  \ with broken windows. On our drive back into the city from jumping cliffs in Arecibo,\
  \ our uber was filled with laughter and the thumping of reggaeton music. Our panama\
  \ hat wearing driver nearly crashed into a paletas cart when he excitedly turned\
  \ his head after hearing me sing some of the words to a song and we roared with\
  \ laughter. He asked us what our next plans were and we told him about heading out\
  \ to the bio-bay just before sunset. \n\t\u201CExcelente! Yes, there the water plants\
  \ will glow in the dark for you. It is amazing and people come from all over the\
  \ world to see them!\u201D He beamed with pride.\n\tSuddenly, as we pulled around\
  \ a cobblestone street, there was an enormous crowd of people before a large building\
  \ and a mass of shoes laid out in rows between them all. \n\t\u201CWhat's going\
  \ on?\u201D I asked and our driver sighed,\n\t\u201CToday there is a protest by\
  \ the people to encourage the government to count our country's dead from the storm.\
  \ I believe it is unknown still how many we have lost.\u201D We politely asked to\
  \ be let out ahead of the crowd of people and thanked him for the laughs. Outside\
  \ we began walking toward the plaza, slowly, quietly, together. When we got there\
  \ each of us stopped in various places; one in front of a little girl with a sign\
  \ that read, \u201Cmi pap\xED fue uno,\u201D my dad was one.  There were brothers\
  \ tucking flowers in the soles of Nike high tops and daughters slipping pictures\
  \ under worn salsa heels. They were here to lay down their loved ones' shoes and\
  \ would not leave until the government knew that each one of those hundreds of vacant\
  \ soles would not be forgotten. \n\tAn older woman with a tomato juice-stained apron\
  \ appeared by my side, and with a wrinkled smile she ran her hand down the flowered\
  \ tattoo that is engraved in my shoulder and reads 'I carry you with me' in Spanish.\
  \ \n\t\u201CIt's beautiful, what is it for?\u201D She asked leaning in with curiosity.\n\
  \t\u201CIt's for the people that are far from me that I always hold close,\u201D\
  \ I answered, brushing my hair away so she could see better, \u201CI carry them\
  \ with me.\u201D\nShe went over it again as if reading braille, her eyes heavy as\
  \ she looked up at me, \n\t\u201CI carry mine too, hermana.\u201D For a moment we\
  \ watched people hug and hold up signs. There were others who simply knelt before\
  \ their shoes, tucking in the laces or straightening up the straps, presenting a\
  \ place where their people once stood. She squeezed my shoulder one more time and\
  \ told me,\n\t\u201CEst\xE1s bienvenida aqu\xED,\u201D you are welcome here, before\
  \ walking away back to her shoes filled with flowers and memories. \n\tPuerto Rico,\
  \ you are not the same since the waters reached your homes. Now, you have fuerza,strength,\
  \ and paint it on the walls of your buildings in the colors of the flag for all\
  \ to see. I came to you eager for your rhythm and sugar bread rolls, not knowing\
  \ I'd find in every intricately flowered tile the story of the hands that painted\
  \ them. Your people are your pulse and you are not a stranger; you are the small\
  \ family bakery that stays open late so that one more person gets a chance to taste\
  \ your sweetness. \n \tOn the night of the protest we went to Vieques to kayak the\
  \ bioluminescent bay where microscopic ocean organisms glow in the dark when water\
  \ shakes. So we went out after sunset, holding hands with strangers to keep our\
  \ boats together, and then splashed the water to find the universe still glitters\
  \ for us even in the darkness."
