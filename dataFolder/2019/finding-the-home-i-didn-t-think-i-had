Text: "When one travels alone for a 21st birthday in the middle of the winter, I\u2019\
  m sure there are many destinations that come to mind. Was Berlin one of those destinations\
  \ that came to yours? If so, maybe you are just like me- in need of isolation, in\
  \ need of something new, in need of a new friend.\n\nLiving in Prenzlauer Berg for\
  \ a week right on the edge where the Berlin Wall once stood, that is where I set\
  \ my sights on my new journey. As a young gay American from Brooklyn, New York I\
  \ was looking for friendships and experiences. 21 didn\u2019t mean anything to these\
  \ Germans as the legal drinking age was 18. That didn\u2019t matter to me, all I\
  \ needed was acknowledgment and validation away from my stomping grounds. \n\nIn\
  \ the end, my best friend that I didn\u2019t know I always had, this person who\
  \ was once unrecognizable to me, who I didn\u2019t think I knew was myself all along.\
  \ It was me who took myself out on my birthday and it was me who would get lost\
  \ at unknowingly hours of the morning with a dead iPhone and find myself back home\
  \ again. All along, home was whereever I was. I did not need to go to Berlin to\
  \ find home although it became a second home to me. Wherever I was and wherever\
  \ I am, that will always be home."
