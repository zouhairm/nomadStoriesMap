Text: "Beads of sweat forming between my shoulders and squished uncomfortably close\
  \ to a stranger, my two companions and I ride north towards Gangtok, the capital\
  \ city of Sikkim.\n\nConsidering that it used to be its own country, it\u2019s annual\
  \ foreign tourist count was around fifty thousand in 2017 and it\u2019s the first\
  \ state in India to declare itself fully organic, Sikkim remains relatively unknown\
  \ to most of the world. \n\nWe have just 5 days to explore as much of Gangtok and\
  \ the western district of Sikkim as possible. On our agenda: Nathula, Tsomgo Lake\
  \ and Rey Monastery. First things first; we call Reuben, our makeshift tour guide,\
  \ who arranges a car and our permits for the next day. We are going to Tsomgo lake,\
  \ 17 km from Nathula the Chinese-Indian border. \n\nTwo things are evident in Sikkim,\
  \ the first; tourists are sensitive property. In total we had to get three different\
  \ permits while travelling in this state (on top of our Indian Visas), we routinely\
  \ had to check-in to police stops and border areas? Forget about it, especially\
  \ Nathula, this is out of bounds much to our disappointment. The official reason\
  \ for this; it is not a safe area for foreigners. The unofficial reason: the government\
  \ fears foreigners are trading secrets with chinese operatives.\n\nThe second thing\
  \ we notice is the oppressive army presence throughout the cities, villages and\
  \ mountains that lead to the lake. I couldn\u2019t help but feel a weight of guilt\
  \ and uneasiness created by their presence, I\u2019m reminded of the sensation of\
  \ checking your rear vision mirror only to notice a Police unit has begun following\
  \ you. Not breaking the law, but under suspicion nonetheless.\n\nThe car ride to\
  \ Tsomgo lake was significantly less crowded and stuffy than our journey the day\
  \ before and far more entertaining. The Border Road Organisation, more commonly\
  \ (and humorously) known as BRO, have installed surprisingly witty, thought provoking\
  \ roadside safe driving signs. My pick of the bunch being \u201CMake Love Not War\
  \ But Nothing while Driving\u201D because I wasn't expecting smutty humour from\
  \ BRO and \u201CSafety On Road, Safe Tea\u2019 At Home, Drive Slow\u201D because\
  \ I adore a cup of tea.\n\nLocated 3700 meters above sea level the lake is snow\
  \ covered and inaccessible for large parts of the year. Making it a hard life for\
  \ villages and the locals. A tourist activity, the gondola also seems to be punished\
  \ by the harsh conditions of the area, rickety and terrifying we decided to take\
  \ a ride. In good weather you can see a panoramic view to Kanchenjunga, the Third\
  \ Highest Mountain in the World. Unfortunately, it was not our lucky day, absolutely\
  \ freezing and barely able to see five meters in front of noses at the summit, we\
  \ quickly climbed back into the gondola for the stomach dropping trip back down.\n\
  \nThe drive back toward Gangtok brought back the same tension of being watched or\
  \ followed. Our next few days pass similarly, we find a constant army presence and\
  \ a complete lack of foreign tourists. \n\nWhen it finally comes time to head back\
  \ across the border into the state of West Bengal, we are both sad our time in Sikkim\
  \ has come to a close but looking forward to the relief we will feel of being out\
  \ of high security zone. Our next destination, Darjeeling, a place known for its\
  \ highly coveted and widely exported variety of Tea.\n\nYou could say, we are heading\
  \ back to Safe Tea."
