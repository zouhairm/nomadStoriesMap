Text: 'I was working on a cruise ship, my family is from Argentina, we are very poor
  but with a huge sacrifice they help me to catch that dream, was my first port, my
  cabin mate and I were having a good day on-board we joined to the ship at Malta
  and our next port was Mykonos, we decided to walk all day long, we went to a place
  when we buy spices, I bought 2 box, one for me and other to my brother, he love
  to cook as me, but we have different styles, I preferred soft food and he prefers
  spicy food, 50% chilli peppers, anyway, then we went to a restaurant, all day walking
  and buying food we started to be starving and we went to a amazing restaurant, we
  ask for local food, but cheap, we were spending our money and we haven''t had enough
  to all week until they pay us a few money for our job.

  Waitress came with a huge piece of meat and chips, my friend drink beer and I ask
  for a coke, we started to talk until earth move and we start to feel fear because
  we never felt a movement like that, it was strong and to us was like a huge shake.

  Waitress came to us and he ask if we were fine, he told us Greece is a country with
  a lot of days like that day, and we start to eat our food but always paying attention
  just in case we must go to the ship again, we start to talk to meet each other with
  my cabin mate and she told me about she is only child, her mom is very nice with
  her, she want to have brother''s but she never took about that with her mom and
  things like that until an stranger man came to us and start to talk to us in other
  language, I suppose he didn''t speak English because he was talking to us in his
  language and I look at his table and I saw he has a French friend, I started to
  talk with him in French (my cabin mate only speak in English) and he invited us
  to his yacht, we accepted because he look very nice and we pay our meal, I told
  to our waitress we were very thankful for his attention, he was very nice, I left
  him a tip, a good one and we went to that hatch, that guy was a millionaire, he
  owned half Greece, he was very nice with us, he invited us to Greece next time we
  were there, he wanted to show us Greece because he thought we will be there more
  than a few ours, then we went to the ship and our ship wasn''t there, thing was
  we confused the place we were docking and we arrive 10 minutes earlier than we should
  be at the ship, he give us his phone number to call him when we came back to Greece
  but we never came back to Mykonos again, was a lovely day and we won''t forget that
  fantastic day, was a great adventure, I hope to visit again Greece, it was a lovely
  day.'
