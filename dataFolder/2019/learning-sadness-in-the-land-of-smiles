Text: "Facing away from the loud and dusty Bangkok streets, sitting in a small restaurant,\
  \ I had just finished my dinner of tofu pad thai when I got the text message.\n\n\
  \t\u201CAnty kaythi [sic] passed away\u201D\n\nAfter visiting my mother\u2019s relatives\
  \ in Myanmar a month ago, having departed to Bangkok only that day, I had grown\
  \ close to her sister, my aunt, in that time. Reading my step father\u2019s words,\
  \ I felt confused, shocked, and suddenly saddened.\n\n\u201CDoes Mom know?\u201D\
  \ I asked, knowing my mother was in the process of multiple layovers, foreign airports,\
  \ and hours in the sky back to Canada. I kept thinking about her, trapped in a small\
  \ cabin with strangers, everyone finding out about the death of her sister, except\
  \ her. \n\n\t\u201CNot yet\u201D\n\nNo way to communicate with her, no one for her\
  \ to talk to. \n\nI sat, sobbing, at my table for twenty minutes, my food finished\
  \ long ago. Wiping my eyes, I was grateful the two women running the restaurant,\
  \ appearing to be a mother and daughter, had given me space and averted their attention.\
  \ I typed out a message on a translation app, wanting to apologize and explain myself,\
  \ and passed my phone to the server who came over.\n\n\u201CMy family just told\
  \ me my aunt died this morning. I just saw her a few days ago. My mother doesn\u2019\
  t know yet and it\u2019s going to break her heart. / \u0E04\u0E23\u0E2D\u0E1A\u0E04\

  \u0E01\u0E2A\u0E25\u0E32\u0E22\u201D\n\nThe written Thai message bewildering to\
  \ my own eyes, I watched her scan the text, hold the phone up to her ear and listen\
  \ to it, and upon reading it again, recognition flashed through her eyes. In that\
  \ second, by repeating what I\u2019d been told, I turned tragedy into reality, and\
  \ started weeping again. With deep sorrow and sympathy in the knit of her brows\
  \ and frown of her mouth, she wrapped her thin arms around my shoulders, and pulled\
  \ me into her chest, relaying the message to her mother and beginning to console\
  \ me in Thai.\n\nShe continued to speak to me in warm words, cradling me. With no\
  \ knowledge of Thai beyond \u201Chello\u201D and \u201Cthank you\u201D, I could\
  \ not translate her words, but in this unadulterated moment of pain and comforting,\
  \ her intent was clear to me. \u201CIt\u2019s okay. This is the way of life. I am\
  \ so sorry for your loss and my heart aches with you.\u201D\n\nAfter finally composing\
  \ myself, following many false starts only to break down again, I thanked them both,\
  \ bowing slightly, and left. I walked back through the streets, still noisy and\
  \ full of energy despite the late hour, tears drying, streaming, and drying on my\
  \ face. I thought about my mother, the thirteen hour time difference between my\
  \ friends and family at home, and how I was in busy, big Bangkok, all alone.\n\n\
  Back at the bridge by Sathorn Pier where I had crossed in the sunlight that afternoon,\
  \ awed by the skyscrapers and bustle of Bangkok, I could not find myself able to\
  \ cross. Dreading going back to my hostel where I was a stranger, I neared the soccer\
  \ field to my right, where a boy, hair shaven down to his seven or eight year old\
  \ head, was kicking a ball around. What are Thai customs? How do they respond to\
  \ strangers? Despite my worry, I approached and pantomimed, pointing to the ball,\
  \ to myself, to us. \n\nWe played multiple games, him giggling as I jumped with\
  \ the ball between my feet, laughing as he maneuvered around me, and sharing high\
  \ fives when he scored well-deserved goals. His parents smiled at me from the grassy\
  \ field edges.\n\nI left Sathorn Park with lightness. The Land of Smiles had granted\
  \ me one of my own.\n\nI was alone in a city of eight million people, surrounded\
  \ by honking cars and gasoline-scented streets, but in the night, when I needed\
  \ it, I was not alone. People became my family, supported me, shared joy and love\
  \ with me, and made me feel less of a stranger to Bangkok, and to mourning."
