Text: "I spent the better part of the day wandering the streets of Varanasi on my\
  \ own. \u2018Street\u2019 is probably too generous a term for the narrow alleyways\
  \ crowded with cows, vendors and motorbikes abruptly honking their way through the\
  \ bustling chaos. Spiritual electricity pumped through my veins as I navigated the\
  \ maze alone. My ultimate goal was to reach the famous \u2018Blue Lassi\u2019 \u2013\
  \ which is basically a hole in the wall shop serving up freshly made lassi of the\
  \ most exquisite flavours including coconut pomegranate, chocolate banana and tropical\
  \ pineapple. They\u2019re made right in front of you and garnished so magnificently.\
  \ I opted for the basic mango lassi, knowing that I could compare it to the mango\
  \ lassi at the local Indian restaurant back home. There\u2019s a reason why this\
  \ shop comes so highly recommended and the d\xE9cor of a million tiny travellers\u2019\
  \ photographs collaged on the wall simply adds to its magic. I\u2019ll be returning\
  \ tomorrow to sample a more adventurous combination. \n\nRather than walking back\
  \ through the alleyways, I chose to walk alongside the Ghats, beginning at Dashashwamedh.\
  \ I offered a blessing by the riverside under an umbrella. This involved the Sadhu\
  \ painting my forehead with stripes of different coloured clay, repeating chants\
  \ after they were sung to me, splashing my right hand with blessed water from the\
  \ Ganges, placing flowers and leaves onto a little stand and then stating the names\
  \ of my family before being told to pay him. I didn't exactly feel awashed of my\
  \ eternal sins but I was definitely intrigued by the mysticism. \n\nOn my way back\
  \ to the hotel I was confronted by a young, frail woman with a sleeping baby slung\
  \ across her body. Rather than money, she requested a meal for her baby and this\
  \ pulled on my heartstrings. She led me down one of the alleyways to a vendor shop\
  \ that stocked baby food. I bought her a large box for a little less than $4 and\
  \ while we waited we conversed a little \u2013 her name was Mala and her baby\u2019\
  s name was Ali. The way she articulated her baby\u2019s name sounded so similar\
  \ to \u2018Halle\u2019 (my youngest sister\u2019s name) and I felt like I was led\
  \ to help her for a reason. The chances that I could have been that 20 year old\
  \ woman, bearing my own child in such unforgiving circumstances were all too real.\
  \ \n\nEarlier today I also saw a woman with a toddler who had the most painful looking\
  \ sores embedded all over his body.  The flies gravitated toward them and she asked\
  \ me for 10 indian rupees, I handed it to her frail son and his face lit up. Toddlers\
  \ back home wouldn\u2019t know the value, let alone the purpose of a 20 cent coin\
  \ and yet here, the little boy knew exactly what it meant for him."
