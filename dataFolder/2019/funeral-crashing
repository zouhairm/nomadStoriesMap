Text: "What does one wear to a funeral for someone they\u2019ve never met who has\
  \ been dead for two years? A question that strangely I\u2019ve never had to ponder\
  \ before now. \n\nI arrived in the highlands of Toraja just a few hours ago and\
  \ already I\u2019ve been invited to go to one of the elaborate funerals that this\
  \ area is famous for. I solve the wardrobe question with a black shirt and leggings\
  \ and rush downstairs where my driver is waiting. \n\nI hop on the back of his motorcycle\
  \ and we\u2019re off. Once we\u2019re out of the city the landscape changes immensely.\
  \ A combination of mountains, rice fields and palm trees like nothing I\u2019ve\
  \ seen before. The hills seem to go on forever and are scattered with the odd house\
  \ that looks too picturesque to even be real. I spin around on the motorcycle to\
  \ try and take it all in; thankful that having lived in Java for the better part\
  \ of the last year has given me more than enough practice riding on the back of\
  \ motorcycles. \n\nWe park in a field and trek for a few minutes through the mud\
  \ to get to the funeral grounds. On one side of us are wooden platforms, each big\
  \ enough to fit twenty or so people sitting cross legged, built in the traditional\
  \ style of the houses I\u2019d seen on the way here. My guide tells me the legend\
  \ is that when the Bugi\u2019s people first settled in the highland of Toraja they\
  \ built their houses to mimic the great ships that had brought them here. I\u2019\
  m surprised when he tells me that the platform we\u2019re sitting on was built especially\
  \ for this particular funeral and will be dismantled afterwards. On the other side\
  \ of us is a dirt arena surrounded by more raised platforms (these ones permanent)\
  \ filled with people sitting around talking and eating. This is where the bull fighting\
  \ will be later. \n\nGuests are continuing to arrive. Truck after truck keep rolling\
  \ in and from each of them eight or nine men pile out of the back carrying live\
  \ pigs strung up between bamboo poles. The whole thing reminds me more of the rodeos\
  \ back home than the funerals I\u2019m familiar with. Men sliding through the mud\
  \ in their boots, lit cigarette in their mouth, trying to get a screaming pig to\
  \ the appointed butchering spot. \n\nSuddenly a pig lands on its back a couple feet\
  \ from where I\u2019m sitting. The boys carrying it have apparently gotten tired\
  \ of its whining. They exchange a few words and then with a shrug, the boy closest\
  \ to me grabs a machete and slices the pig\u2019s throat. There\u2019s a giant spurt\
  \ of bright red blood and the animal is silent. The boys pick it back up again,\
  \ finding it much easier to transport now. Canada and Java are both starting to\
  \ feel like different worlds.\n\nSoon it\u2019s time for the casket to arrive. It\
  \ appears in the distance, having been carried by more than twenty men all the way\
  \ from the widow\u2019s house to the funeral grounds. The men reach me and the rest\
  \ of the guests, set the casket down and crack open a case of beer. They all drink\
  \ a beer with their departed loved one before moving him to the tower where he will\
  \ stay for the duration of the multi-day ceremony, until enough pigs and buffalo\
  \ have been slaughtered to go with and protect him in the afterlife. \n\nI\u2019\
  m soon caught up in the festive atmosphere. A member of the family dressed in a\
  \ white suit and hat hops up next to the casket and starts to share some stories.\
  \ I can\u2019t understand a word of it but the enthusiasm in his voice is unmistakable\
  \ and it makes me smile. I watch the kids laughing as they chase chickens through\
  \ the mud and think about how much time and effort has gone into this celebration\
  \ of a man\u2019s life. And how much fun everyone seems to be having. I sip the\
  \ beer someone hands me and just marvel at the incredible ceremony I\u2019ve somehow\
  \ been allowed to be a part of.I wonder what tomorrow will bring."
