Text: Well I'm a guy from a very small town ajmer and growing up in amber is a quite
  fun because i remember that how i used to hear some traditional horror tales so
  when i applied and selected for a college in vadodara in gujarat i used to tell
  stories to people like some serious horror stories do that's whenever found put
  that image some good stories to write and could get some good content from different
  places so when i was in vadodara i sit with some who i don't know much but i used
  to tell them a story which o gave a title of " the tale of an unexpected traveller"
  this story was about a bridge which is known as martinal bridge in ajmer and at
  midnight there's a red car which comes and forces you to go under that bridge and
  if you'll enter in that bridge you'll see ghosts with no head are trying to catch
  you and abusing you so that they could sit with you and cross that bridge and when
  i told them that story thery were like that's one hell of a story and those guys
  are now my best friends
