Text: "I know it's very known, the name - 'The Taj'. But here i like to disclose the\
  \ other facts about it and the city. \nThe city revolves around the centre where\
  \ the Taj is, seems very beautiful from the top. Afterall it's a gem. But when you\
  \ step up in the city, you'll find some unpleasant truth which is unexpected from\
  \ this reputed city. Cows near garbage, and most of the garbage on the roads is\
  \ one of them. Children expect to be in schools or playground, I found them in corners\
  \ doing local drugs. I saw a drunken man lying on the road like that was his bed.\
  \ I observed the very sorrow thing over there is 'their people are the one destroying\
  \ their pride' . I wished I could interpret in all that matters. I tried once too,\
  \ when I saw a child doing drugs in the corner , I called 1098 which is the child\
  \ helpline. Well, they supported me and suggested to take him to any nearby police\
  \ station. I did as per them. By the help of some good peoples, i took him to the\
  \ police station, and after some formalities i thought i've done my part and came\
  \ back. But the saddest thing i saw the next day after this incident - 'the same\
  \ boy, doing the same thing, at the same place' . That's what I got. \nNow whenever\
  \ I remember about that scenario and of course the whole trip, undoubtedly 'The\
  \ Taj' is beauty. But if I could help that boy to reach any kinda childcare or any\
  \ boarding school, that could be my best trip. Hope , I'll do the same one day."
