Text: "Having seen half of Europe, the time for Africa came. Having travelled with\
  \ a big noisy company, this time I am taking off alone. Having loved rain, I am\
  \ seeking for the sun. \nGoing through the crowd, I am coming to the doors of the\
  \ airport and looking for the familiar face that I cannot recognize. Maybe he is\
  \ not going to meet me? (Ah, I see you! You scared me).\nSince the first look, it\
  \ seems like another world. Everything is different - continent, religion, culture,\
  \ language, the unique perception of the world, people, and life. But why do I feel\
  \ as if I am at home? \nHere not everyone knows what a pedestrian crossing is, few\
  \ throw trash into the dumpster and not on the ground, women do not wear shorts\
  \ and all of them are scared of dogs, people are kiss-lovers (if no, how to justify\
  \ that fact when you meet a new person you do not say \u201Chi\u201D as usual but\
  \ kiss on the cheek 4 times?), buses run not according to the schedule but when\
  \ the seats are occupied, and the taxi does not mean you will go alone without any\
  \ company. \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s go to the beach side!\u201D I heard and my brain\
  \ started creating pictures. In a while, I woke up.\nIt was my first time when I\
  \ saw the ocean, wild, powerful and calming at the same time. When you are waiting\
  \ for the water to reach your feet, you feel butterflies in the stomach, and when\
  \ it finally does, you are scared and feel as if you are going to lose consciousness.\
  \ It can take you to the ocean depth in a second but gives you a chance to feel\
  \ that you can resist this water element and the idea \u201Cwhy to not take up surfing\u201D\
  \ pops up in your head. \n\n\u201CLet\u2019s go to the market!\u201D\nFood\u2026\
  \ I see tons of fresh fruits and veggies (did I die and woke up in paradise?). Thousands\
  \ of different cookies (I can try all of them, really? Wait, what herbs do they\
  \ add there? It\u2019s incredible). \nWalking around, we found a small shop with\
  \ antique jewellery. Since the moment I entered that small place of history, I fell\
  \ deep into the 17th century, I imagined those women wearing self-made bracelets\
  \ and rings, accepting stone necklaces and earrings from their men as gifts (such\
  \ places must be called museums and the shop-keepers must be guides there). Then\
  \ my gaze fell upon crockery with patterns\u2026 The men are painting it for hours,\
  \ all are unrepeatable and adorable. Here are adults look like kids in a candy shop,\
  \ standing and staring confused in order to choose what to buy. \n\n\u201CWait\u2026\
  \ It is Africa. Where are lions, zebras and elephants? There are only camels and\
  \ donkeys!? Not interesting\u2026 Look! Donkey! Can I hug it?\u201D \nThat is the\
  \ small story of how I met a real donkey in the wild, actually almost the same story\
  \ was with a camel but unfortunately, I saw it only from afar.\n\nIt was just one\
  \ ordinary day in a small city in Morocco but it was my leap into the unknown and\
  \ I liked it. \nTo be continued..."
