Text: "After a half-an-hour's drive from Singtam market, we reached South Sikkim's\
  \ Chalamthang village. Breathtaking beautiful valleys wrapped up with lust greenery\
  \ and the spectacular views of mountains beside the two sides of the road made the\
  \ whole-route so pleasant! There was no cacophony of city-life in the atmosphere.\
  \ It seemed to us that we were gradually getting lost in the lap of mother nature.\n\
  \nActually, we had no plan to visit Chalamthang. Mr. Piku, a humble zip-driver from\
  \ Singtam, suggested that we should spend at least one day in the rejuvenating ambience\
  \ of Chalamthang and assured--\"It's a remote tourist-spot and mid-August is off-season.\
  \ So, you might easily get rooms in the local hotels\" So, the next day, we set\
  \ out for Chalamthang with him.\n\nChalamthang is a little-known village located\
  \ at an average elevation of 5,800 ft. and the local homestay ( known as Amrit's\
  \ Homestay) is 50 stairs up from the motor-able road. So, we had to go upstairs\
  \ to arrive at the main location. Mr. Piku was correct. The homestay was totally\
  \ unoccupied. Therefore, we didn't face any problem to get shelter. Mr. Amrit, the\
  \ owner of the homestay and his sisters cordially welcomed us (we were a group of\
  \ five people including my parents and I from Balurghat, West Bengal) by offering\
  \ Khadas (Khada is a traditional ceremonial scarf\_of Sikkim). The neat and clean\
  \ rooms, thatched roof & the aesthetically decorated Machaan (a place for sitting)\
  \ hanging at a corner of the homestay captivated our minds at first sight. Singtam\
  \ town closed to Chalamthang was covered by the thin layers of the clouds but it\
  \ was peeping behind them frequently as if it was following our activities. \n\n\
  Mr. Amrit's mother is a fanastic cook. She prepared delicious traditional veg cuisines\
  \ for us. After having a grand lunch, each one of us sat on the Machaan in the cloudy\
  \ afternoon and engaged in adda (gossip) with Mr. Amrit and his family. We found\
  \ picturesque Ranipool river that crosses a large distance before its copulation\
  \ with Tista at Singtam. Mr. Amrit introduced Sang & Padam mountain, Zuluk and snow-capped\
  \ Nathula to us.\n\nThe appearance of the village completely changed after sunset.\
  \ The lights of the mountainous inhabitations created a magical contrast with the\
  \ dark mountains. I felt that a whole night can be easily spent sitting on the Machaan\
  \ and watching the bo-peep's of light and darkness. The whole surrounding was looking\
  \ like the dreamland of a fairy-tale. At 8'o clock, Mr. Amrit's elder sister served\
  \ the dinner. Her mother told us the story of \"Dai Festival\" and requested to\
  \ come during the festival. She said in broken Hindi \" December ka mahine me jarur\
  \ aana\" ( please do come in the month of December). From her, we came to know that\
  \ \"Dai Festival\" celebrated in the middle of December (15-20 December) is one\
  \ of the most colourful festivals to the residents of this village to exhibit the\
  \ uniqueness of Sikkimese culture to the outer world. \n\n\nThe day was very brief--\
  \ like an incomprehensible illusion. Each one of us was relishing every single moment.\
  \ However, as we had no pre-plan to go there, we had to leave Chalamthang the next\
  \ day with a sense of profound gloominess. Mr. Amrit was waving at us again and\
  \ again until our car went beyond his vision.\n\nThree years have passed but I can\
  \ still visualize that amazing day in my mind-eye. Sometimes, I become confused.\
  \ Does this place really exist within our familiar world or it's a product of my\
  \ imaginative mind? Then, the photographs and Internet remind me that it can't be\
  \ just a fantasy. Living picture-postcard Chalamthang really exists with its sweet\
  \ drunkenness and impressive tranquillity. But, it doesn't exist in our regular\
  \ world; it's just like a dreamland that discloses itself to the strangers all of\
  \ a sudden but doesn't allow to capture it. I never expected that I would be able\
  \ to find such a magical place in such a mini trip. It was really a gift of God.\
  \ That incomparable tranquility along with the panoramic views of mountains and\
  \ river Tista, that magical night, the Machaan and moreover the impeccable hospitality\
  \ of Amrit-family will last in my mind forever."
