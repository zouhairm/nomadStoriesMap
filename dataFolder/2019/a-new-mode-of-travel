Text: "This was a mistake. None of us would say it, but the thought was quietly hanging\
  \ in the air above our group, along with our crystallized breaths in the 5 AM air.\n\
  \nWe were heading towards Cafe Cambronne, fifteen minutes from our Airbnb. Just\
  \ a couple months earlier in Los Angeles, the four of us sat in the lobby of a friend's\
  \ apartment complex frantically making reservations for shelter and activities.\
  \ As new runners, we jumped on the opportunity to take a \"sight-jogging\" tour\
  \ through Paris.\n\n\"We should keep up with our training while on this trip,\"\
  \ Maria reasoned, with me in her corner.\n\n \"And it looks like there'll be a lot\
  \ of breaks, so we should be fine,\u201D I added. \u201CIt\u2019ll be so fun!\u201D\
  \n\nTwo months, an eight-hour layover in Reykjavik, and five hours of sleep later,\
  \ Maria and I were eating our words as we led Naomi and Tasha further from the comforts\
  \ of our adopted beds, past densely-parked cars. After we made a wrong turn, Naomi\
  \ texted our guide to let him know we'd be a few minutes late. \n\nAs we speed-walked\
  \ under the dark sky hoping the 13\u20AC we each spent didn't get wasted, Maria\
  \ breathlessly joked, \"Are we sure this isn't the jog?\" \n\n#\n\n\nLaurent, a\
  \ lean man in a runner's cap and shorts, was the only person on the corner when\
  \ we finally arrived. In a heavily accented, no-frills manner, he greeted us. \n\
  \n\"Normally, we would do about 18 kilometers, but we will see how much we are able\
  \ to do with our time.\" Before I could calculate that distance into Imperial measurements,\
  \ we were off. \n\nLess than one meter into running, I was painfully aware of the\
  \ pizza, wine, and jet lag that had taken up residence within my muscles. The intrusive\
  \ voice in my head nagged, All I see are cobblestones and red storefronts. Paris\
  \ isn't for running; it's for wine and amazing bread. Why are we doing this, again?\n\
  \nWe turned left onto the long, lush Champ de Mars. At the other end of the green\
  \ stretch was the Eiffel Tower.\n\nOh, yeah. That's why.\n\nMonths ago, we weren\u2019\
  t obsessed with the iconic tower while scheduling our time abroad. It's huge, touristy,\
  \ and impossible to miss. Yet, in the purple light with nobody around, it was breathtaking.\
  \ \n\n\"I'm taking a photo of this shit,\" Maria mumbled. \n\nWe came to a brief\
  \ stop, gasping and in various states of crumble. Laurent, both amused and concerned\
  \ for our welfare, assured us that we were about to get much better photos soon.\
  \ We pushed on. \n\nSoon, we were crossing the gray-green Seine. When we reached\
  \ the foot of a palatial multi-story building, the sun was barely rising. Laurent's\
  \ jewel-toned head led us up wide stairs. \n\nWe\u2019d reached the broad Place\
  \ du Trocadero, which holds a deep history of civil demonstrations. I fought the\
  \ urge to start my own protest against early morning runs. The tingle in my legs\
  \ was unshakable; there was no way I\u2019d make it back down those stairs.\n\n\
  Right when I was about to bow out and head to a cafe, we walked into the kind of\
  \ view I\u2019d only seen in films. Someone - I can't remember who, because we were\
  \ all thinking it simultaneously - gasped, \"Oh, my God.\" \n\nThe Eiffel Tower\
  \ stood bright against an ombre sky, above thousands of slowly dying stars in the\
  \ streets. Low buildings and networks of leafy parks stretched infinitely into the\
  \ distance. At this hour, we were among a small handful of people moving through\
  \ a city of 2.2 million people. From here, it felt like we could see them all. \n\
  \n\"I told you, you'll get better photos up here!\" Laurent smirked, knowingly.\
  \ He let us take our requisite Instagram photos and stroll the square before prompting:\n\
  \n\"Okay, ladies. Ready to go?\"\n\nI didn't take the question for granted. We had\
  \ a lot of ground to cover - was I ready?\n\nOne more look over the balcony, though,\
  \ and I knew; this was more than a convenient training run. This was an introduction\
  \ most people won't have. This was travel. \n\n\"We're ready. What's next?\""
