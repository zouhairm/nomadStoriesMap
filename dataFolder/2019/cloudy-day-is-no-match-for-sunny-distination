Text: "After this long and tiring bus trip, we finally arrived at our destination.\
  \ My mum, my cousin Imane, \nand I. They both planned for this trip a month ago.\
  \ But to get to see what? The sand, really?!\nWell, at first I did not agree to\
  \ come, as there are many other interesting places I would like to \nvisit. However,\
  \ my mum has its own way to always convince me. It took her no more than four \n\
  words, Amira, you are coming!\nI sat down exhausted on the squishy soft sand admiring\
  \ the gorgeous purchase I got on our way\nin absolute joy. A small hourglass with\
  \ bright glittery yellow shiny sand that was so mesmerizing \nto observe. I wasted\
  \ more time than preserved, looking at it. Suddenly, my cousin caught my \nshoulder\
  \ from behind and sat next to me. \n\u201CDo you want to release it back to its\
  \ natural inhabitant?\u201D She joked. \n\"Imane, you know it is never too late\
  \ to apply for that comic job.\" I replied sarcastically. \n\"Why are we here?,\
  \ you cannot tell me that you did not find any other place to spend our holiday\
  \ visiting?\"\n\u201CNo! I want to get to the top of these sand dunes and admire\
  \ the view, take some photos and \nhave a lovely picnic with my lovely cousin.\u201D\
  \nMore of a horrible picnic, it is just sand. I thought.\n\u201CBesides I have a\
  \ surprise for you later. You are going to love it.\u201D She added.\nI stood up,\
  \ put the hourglass back in its box, then in a plastic bag that I tied to my small\
  \ purse. \n\u201CWhen you love something so much, you will end up losing it, you\
  \ know?\" Imane said.\n\"But not if you guard it with your own life, you don\u2019\
  t. \"\n\u201CGirls, if any of you would like to have something to eat, should come\
  \ fast.\u201D My mum shouted.\nLet us race. I said. \nIn the afternoon in Bechar,\
  \ we were ready to climb up these sand mountains. The sand was warm \nand shimmering\
  \ with the sun, and impossible to resist the temptation of playing with it. It brings\
  \ \nyou back all these memories you once had, making you feel like a child again\
  \ in a giant sandbox.\nWe started climbing up the sand dunes. At first, you are\
  \ annoyed by it, getting into your pockets, \nyour hair, your shoes, staining yours\
  \ sucks, and you even start to feel it between your teeth. But \nthen you get used\
  \ to it, and you could see everyone bare feet with their stuff thrown around \n\
  wherever doing backflips and pushing each other and fighting,it was like an outdoors\
  \ under the sunshine slumberparty. I was continually stopping to \nmatch how other\
  \ people are doing. Old men had to stop every two steps to catch their breath. \n\
  As for each step they take forward, the sand took them back four steps behind. Looking\
  \ at them \nmade me realize that most of them wanted to experience being a child\
  \ again. After a while of \nclimbing the sand, we finally reached the top, oddly\
  \ without breaking a sweat, but dusty.\n\u201CSurprise!\u201D Imane shouted. \n\
  At the top, was the beginning of the Algerian Sahara, the sand there was dense,\
  \ hard and cold. \nAll kinds of attractions were laying in front of us. Sky supplies,\
  \ camel rides, cart rides.\nImane and I went to ride the camels, something I have\
  \ never experienced before. We almost fell \ndown when the camel started to stand.\
  \ I made sure to keep holding Imane as my life depends on \nit. And it does. The\
  \ camel started to move in a very strange way, that even after we got down, \nwe\
  \ still feel it in our body.\nThey started to play some local music with instruments\
  \ made by them. Then, they served us some \nlocal drinks and food. As it was close\
  \ to sunset, Imane and I climbed up the highest sand mountain \nwe found around.\
  \ We sat at the top watching the sunset, as it reflects all its beautiful colors\
  \ on \nthe sand. The weather started to be cold, and the sand felt like snow. I\
  \ held Imane hand and said, \nand here is my surprise. We skied."
