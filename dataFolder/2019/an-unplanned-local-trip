Text: On a Beautiful summers day deciding to leave the busy city for the beautiful
  quite town of rawsonville. It started off as a joke but turned into a beautiful
  yet scary experience as one would think that leaving the city for the Winelands
  would be as bored as living without a television.. It ended up being one of the
  most beautiful experiences of my life. About to leave Cape Town a few friends and
  I decided a journey outside of the city would be good, as we were about to leave
  I could hear one asking the other "if we are really doing this as not one of us
  knew where to go or which turns to take".. Eventually we took off driving into the
  unknown as all of us would usually be accompanied by an older person when going
  on holiday, however we had decided to take this trip ourselves. Eventually leaving
  through the beautiful hougenot tunnel where pitch black hits you and eventually
  exiting and seeing green nature everywhere, it would have been a pity not to get
  out to take pictures at every second beautiful scene. we would stop and take a picture
  because that's what youngsters do for the gram especially coloureds haha. Eventually
  we ended up at the beautiful Goudini spa resort where we spent the day in amazing
  man-made pools, great scenery and excellent staff. There was something about hearing
  birds chirping everyone, little children running around and jumping in the water.
  A sense of peace came over me and I was as relaxed as a leave blowing gently through
  the wind.
