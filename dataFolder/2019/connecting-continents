Text: "One year ago today four friends and I converged upon Hvulukani in the Mpumalanga\
  \ region of South Africa.  This small village a stones throw from Kruger National\
  \ Park at the intersection of two dusty roads in the Northeast region of the country\
  \ was our destination. Two Americans and three French.  The two Frenchmen had come\
  \ by boat on a stop on a round the world sailing trip. I had come from Chicago,\
  \ another from San Francisco and another from Calais.  We were invited to stay in\
  \ the homes of a local teacher and friend.  They welcomed us as if we were family.\
  \  We broke bread with them in their dining rooms and got to know their families.\
  \  On our first day we went to a local school to start helping build a library.\
  \  The school had no fiction books or WiFi.  With cameras in hand we met the students\
  \ and staff at the school and immediately started to connect using the cameras.\
  \  We taught them how to use them and asked them to document their lives and show\
  \ us the photos they took.  This started conversations about life and family and\
  \ struggles. We got to know them in a way that would never have been possible otherwise.\
  \  Meanwhile our companions started to work on the library by ripping out floors\
  \ in a dilapidated mobile classroom.  We bought flooring, paint and wood to make\
  \ shelves.  We worked with a local bookseller to buy books for the finished space.\
  \  Later we ordered sofas through a local furniture maker in hues of red and blue\
  \ to make the space inviting.\nThe principal, teachers and students were thrilled\
  \ and thanked us in many rounds of song.  It\u2019s amazing how a concerted effort\
  \ to accomplish a goal can bring people of many cultures together.\nWe are all more\
  \ alike than different.  I feel blessed to have had this experience."
