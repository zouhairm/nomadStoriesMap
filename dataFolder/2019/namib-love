Text: "December 2018. Excitement took the hold of me when I went to Namibia for the\
  \ first time.. I was curious about the culture, people and hungry just about everything\
  \ of this country.\n\nI took the road early morning and passed the boarder at Noordoewer,\
  \ Northen Cape border of South Africa. First thing I noticed was the long distances\
  \ between little town.\n\nFriendly people. Most of them pretty poor, with big hearts.\
  \ I also noticed how immaculately clean towns were.\n\nAt Windhoek I saw Herero\
  \ women. Oh oh! I wanted to take a picture with them? Not that easy? Here you will\
  \ pay to get anything on camera. Well, I guess you will pay for everything in Namibia.\
  \ I tried to talk to them? No? They have a translator. You will talk through him\
  \ and for information, you will pay.\n\nThe history of the hereroes are beautiful.\
  \ The traditional gowns of women are a big trend in the fashion industry. With a\
  \ population of one hundred and fifty thousand, they are quite a unique bumch of\
  \ people. These cattle breeding, traditional people, formely lived in a country\
  \ of water and reeds.\n\nThey have a chief that's like a king to them. Some of them\
  \ actually are Christians. I believe most of them are found in the capital of Namibia,\
  \ Windhoek. Beautiful city.\n\nThe hereroes have an annual festival on the closest\
  \ Sunday of August 23rd, held in Okahandja. Okahandja is next town from Windhoek,\
  \ about 140 kilometers west, on the coastal route.\n\nI booked myself in in an fine\
  \ guesthouse in Windhoek. Arrebbush country lodge. In the middle of the wild. I\
  \ sat on the back patio a wild bucks were walking nearby. I unwined and just listened\
  \ to the stillness of the night. Later I took a shower and went to a comfy queen\
  \ size bed.\n\nThe breakfast the next morning was out of this world. Boerewors,\
  \ pap (traditional porridge) With tomato and onion gravy. This was devine. The host\
  \ was an Ovambo man, very friendly and helpful. \n\nEn route Swakopmund, the surroundings\
  \ got a little deserty and cool. With 1000 kilometers behind me, I'm now even more\
  \ excited to get to Swakopmund, the coastal capital of Namibia.\n\nIn  way it makes\
  \ me think of Los Angeles. Beautiful and majestic building. Wow! Germans everywhere.\
  \ What's going on here? In Swakopmund desert meets ocean. I wish I could upload\
  \ photos here. Here I found Damaras, Ovambos, germans, Portuguese, Spanish-speaking\
  \ peoplee and of course the Afrikaans speaking busters.\n\nI lived everything about\
  \ Swakopmund. How will I become a citizen here? I understand now why Brat Pitt and\
  \ Angelina Jolie came here to adopt a child.\nI was at a seafood restaurant on ocean\
  \ itself!, surrounded by water, you can hear sea and feel the waves breaking underneath\
  \ you. Best food ever!\n\nThe nightlife in Swakopmund is on another level. Car racing\
  \ and popping wheels a sport the young people loved.\n\nWalsvisbay is just 30 kilometers\
  \ south of Swakopmund and Hentiesbay North. Walvisbay is a little smaller then Swakopmund\
  \ but also very beautiful... The coastal road between Swakopmund and Walvisbay is\
  \ where the Namib desert meets the Atlantic ocean... It's a spectacular view. You\
  \ can not go to Namibia and miss this, never!\n\nCamel riding and quad biking on\
  \ the dunes are a big, big must.\n\nThere are so much to do in the beautiful country.\
  \ Next time I will go up North. I  didn't have much of the wild life of Namibia.\
  \ First time was only the coastal towns.\n\nThis country is full of heritage, culture,\
  \ traditions and so much more. The president of this country is a Sam Nyoma. I wish\
  \ I could get the opportunity the thank him in person for this clean and organized\
  \ country. The streets of all towns are so clean. And they say the crime is pretty\
  \ low.\n\nWell this is it from me Cara and my visit to Namibia\n\nI hope I will\
  \ soon hear from you\n\nCara"
