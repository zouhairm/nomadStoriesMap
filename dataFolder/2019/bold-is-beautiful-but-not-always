Text: "Rishikesh is pristine and mesmerising... the river Ganga can be intimadating\
  \ and at the same time one can keep adoring it\u2019s charm and gigantic aura....\n\
  I have always been adventurous, one of the kinds who literally believes \u2018fate\
  \ loves the fearless \u2018 which I still very much do. After arriving at Rishikesh\
  \ and hitting the river with our required wherewithal we decided to capture a river\
  \ front and make it more like our beach... there was laughter, admiration for the\
  \ place, happiness and thrill in the air till I decided to awaken my little adventurous\
  \ kid yet again... \njust to give a little background to the ordeal I am a national\
  \ level swimmer hence was I guess a bit overconfident in my shoes... the adventure\
  \ was seen and predicted till the unforeseen unpredictability took place...\nMe\
  \ and my cousin who is 5 years younger to me decided to swim in river Ganga and\
  \ touch a huge stone which lay right in the middle of the river this was around\
  \ 150 metres from the front where we stood... not much I know and that\u2019s exactly\
  \ what I thought?l and on the count of steady, go we both started to swim. Reached\
  \ the stone and touching it obviously along with a few clicks by our friends still\
  \ waiting for our successful return was an obvious fact... after spending 15 odd\
  \ minutes, posing with the formidable stone and it\u2019s beauty, it started to\
  \ get chillier and we decided to swim back... now by this time the waters were fried\
  \ and tested as well, hence fear whatever little bit had famished even... while\
  \ on our way back, my\nCousin happened to gather more energy and swim after than\
  \ me, and I\nCursed myself being 5 years older, grrrr, and suddenly I realised something\
  \ that wasn\u2019t quite right, something that demanded my oh yes bloody immediate\
  \ attention, something that made rush and made me panic and that was when I lost\
  \ nearly all controls over my legs... no matter how much or how hard I tried the\
  \ under currents of the river in this 15 minutes had got so strong that I was helpless\
  \ and couldn\u2019t swim at all... panic started to set in and once realising that\
  \ this actually will be it or else I should shout, I\nYelled at the top of my voice,\
  \ so far taking it as a joke my friends realised the fear in my Boyce and expressions\
  \ started to run here n there but honestly there was nothing much they could have\
  \ done anyways as they were fairly far away from me.. I took a deep breath and with\
  \ all the force and power I had I tried to swim again but to no avail.. tears had\
  \ started rolling already as I could see my death right in bring of my eyes... suddenly\
  \ my cousin who swam safely to the front shouted and trust me his voice was no lesser\
  \ than the angel calling, \u2018grab that bloody stone in front\u2019, and all I\
  \ could see, feel and think of was that BLOODY stone.... being my last chance before\
  \ I had hit the massive rapids, I grabbed the stone with my full faith, prayer and\
  \ courage... of course if I am writing this then of course I am alive however in\
  \ this ordeal I ended up hurting myself pretty bad with a fracture in my leg and\
  \ a few nails broken \U0001F62C but the one lesson that I learnt was to be fearless\
  \ but sensibly... after I was rescued from the stone I clinged to like I won\u2019\
  t even hug the hottest guy, we all were back to our hotel SAFELY.... my cousin opened\
  \ the champagne and all was said was, \u2018to the new chapter of our lives\u2019\
  , and the tag line for the same was \u2018SENSIBLY FEARLESS \u2018 \U0001F61C\U0001F92A\
  \U0001F913 thanks for reading... keep smiling as life is short...."
