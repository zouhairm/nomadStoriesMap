Text: "Even standing in the pocket of sun near Platform 6, the wind billowing through\
  \ the train station was sharp and numbing. I\u2019d been in Newcastle for two months,\
  \ but this was my first train ride, so I was too scared I\u2019d miss it to sit\
  \ in the waiting room. \n\nThe train barreled in the station exactly on time: 12:34pm,\
  \ but I had yet to figure out my seat number. I noticed a lady moving toward the\
  \ train while staying isolated from the crowd. She had long, velvety, almost dark\
  \ purple hair that covered the rest of her face that wasn\u2019t already covered\
  \ by her scarf. With my hand on my chest and a soft voice, I apologized for bothering\
  \ her and asked if we were to just sit anywhere since I didn\u2019t get a seat number.\n\
  \n\u201CYes. Anywhere.\u201D\n\nHer tone suggested she was mocking me for having\
  \ to ask, and again for being so sheepish about it. I could tell from her accent\
  \ that she was from Spain. \n\nI sat down in the first row on the half-full train.\
  \ I was used to people here being particularly conversational, but everyone immediately\
  \ put in their headphones. Over a scratchy speaker, all I could make out was \u201C\
  Carlisle,\u201D so I was on the right train. \n\nA crescendo grew as the train bowled\
  \ out of the station. I was excited to finally see the beauty of the northeast countryside\
  \ of England. That\u2019s the real reason I decided to travel by train.\n\nGraffiti\
  \ lined the walls of the tracks lofted high above the Tyne River that separated\
  \ Newcastle from Gateshead. The Tyne is 73 miles of currents. I could see every\
  \ varying current and how they intertwined in depth. \n\nOutside of the city, the\
  \ sun trying to pierce the clouds shaded rolling hills in a rose-gold hue. Those\
  \ hills went on forever. Some more rose, some more gold, some more shaded, some\
  \ more illuminated, and all perfectly trimmed. \n\nWe passed a block building that\
  \ stood in the middle of a hill. It had no doors, no roof, and none of the walls\
  \ were even at the top. I could still tell that each block was placed purposefully,\
  \ patiently in its place, and I didn\u2019t question that it was there for a reason,\
  \ even if I didn\u2019t know what that was. No two blocks looked the same. None\
  \ of them had sharp corners or straight edges. They were all grey, but none the\
  \ same shade. The plaid pattern of flawless, freshly cut grass continued through\
  \ the building. It was a rugged, but gently beautiful scene. \n\nI was interrupted\
  \ by the attendant asking for my ticket. After me, he asked the woman across the\
  \ aisle for hers. He scolded her for not having the card she supposedly bought her\
  \ ticket with for him to authenticate it. \n\n\u201CJust make sure you have the\
  \ card next time.\u201D\n\n\u201CI usually have it in my purse,\u201D she replied\
  \ as she continued to shuffle through her bag in vain.\n\n\u201CAlways,\u201D the\
  \ attendant emphasized.\n\nI turned back to my window. Now the fields were filled\
  \ with cows. A lot of them were laying down, and as the myth goes, the mist surely\
  \ turned into rain. I saw the airy blue sky softly ombr\xE9 into an orangish-pink\
  \ color that met the drizzled hills at the horizon. It rained almost every day here.\
  \ It felt obligatory at this point. \n\nThe brakes wailed again before we came to\
  \ a stop. An hour and a half for 59 miles, not bad for a train ride to my first\
  \ English date. Passengers walked past me with squinted eyes and suppressed yawns.\
  \ \n\nI stepped out of the cabin into wind that was as unforgiving as Newcastle\u2019\
  s. \n\nI saw a distant wave through the sea of winter coats and walked toward the\
  \ exit of the station.\n\n \u201CHey, how are you? How was your drive?\u201D \n\n\
  I walked slowly since I didn\u2019t know which car I was looking for. I grabbed\
  \ the left door handle that ended a scratch about a yard long on a tiny, spacey\
  \ blue car that was parked diagonally to the station. \n\nRealizing I didn\u2019\
  t listen to the answer, I asked, \u201CHow was your drive?\u201D"
