Text: When I had the chance to visit Mexico, the thing that impressed me the most,
  apart from its colours and flavors, was the kindness of its people's heart. Mexicans
  will always treat you politely and be willing to help you with anything you need,
  from an enquiry to get to a place, to the explanation of how a meal is preapared
  and which ingredients and spices it takes. People are quiet and respectful in the
  bus, in the streets and in hotels and restaurants where they receive you like you
  were at home. Apart from that warm welcome, the span of colors  you can find in
  the textiles they show and in the country's architecture where finding blue orange
  or yellow in the facades can be often a flash to your eyes, is a remarkable experience
  for those who like me, adore aesthetic plus historical views. You can find the maya
  and azteca's art in every little corner you gasp, as well as, much more modern works
  like spectacular Diego Rivera's murales. Last but not least, are their meals, frequently
  spicy but each of them with unique tastes like their special broths or their flowered
  waters to calm the thirst after witnessing so much beauty and warmth in a place
  I can asure your retine will never forget.
