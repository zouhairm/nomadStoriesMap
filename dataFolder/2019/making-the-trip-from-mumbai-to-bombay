Text: "On the wee hours of a December Friday, I found myself de-boarding on to a deserted\
  \ platform at the Sandhurst Road station. I was coming into the island city from\
  \ the eastern suburbs on the first morning local (train) \u2013 the city\u2019s\
  \ exhausted public transport system. As I climbed up to the main platform deck,\
  \ I was joined by a throng of commuters and together, we emerged out on the western\
  \ gate of the station and waited, as a line of kaali-peelis (cabs painted in black\
  \ and yellow) pulled up to us as drivers called out destinations \u2013 \u2018Chor\
  \ Bazaar\u2019, \u2018Do tanki\u2019, \u2018Dongri\u2019! I squeezed myself into\
  \ the backseat of an old Fiat Padmini with three other people and as the middle-aged\
  \ driver revved up his engine, Mohd. Rafi blasted out of his fine-tuned speakers.\n\
  \nGiven, the odd hours, the traffic was bare minimum and in no time, I reached Do\
  \ Tanki, where I got off and waited for Anjali, my tour guide for the morning. It\
  \ was around 4:10 am when Anjali, dressed in a pink salwar kameez with a red dupatta\
  \ tightly wrapped around her head and face, made her appearance. I had met Anjali\
  \ through an NGO with who I worked on a community development project. Anjali, a\
  \ 20-year-old girl from Kamathipura had been a great resource person for us in navigating\
  \ the field of study and had become a fast friend. It was she, who offered to take\
  \ me around the rather infamous, night markets of Old Bombay.\n\nAs she tightly\
  \ clasped on to her dupatta, hiding two-thirds of her face, we entered Kamathipura,\
  \ the red-light district of the old city, though most of the soliciting work now\
  \ was carried out only in the 13th  lane of the district yet the area had its reputation\
  \ and it was not at all desirable for two young girls to be seen roaming the streets\
  \ at such a time. The night market stretched from the first to the third lane finally\
  \ converging on to an open public ground. The sellers laid most of their wares out\
  \ by the side of the streets, on blue tarpaulin sheets laid on the ground. Their\
  \ wares mostly comprised of footwear of different kinds and makes \u2013 sports\
  \ shoes, sandals, formal shoes, loafers made in canvas or leather featuring logos\
  \ of popular global brands! Back in the days, shoes and chappals picked up from\
  \ various religious precincts like temples and mosques across the country found\
  \ their way to this market. However, the market, today is teemed with locally made\
  \ counterfeit goods or export reject surplus items getting sold at dirt cheap prices\
  \ starting at 100 rupees a pair. It is said that if luck favours, one can actually\
  \ go back home with an original pair of Clarks or Ted Baker (with of course defects\
  \ but minuscule for a human eye to detect), dispensing only a few hundred bucks\
  \ from one\u2019s pockets! Along with footwear sellers, there were also a number\
  \ of vendors selling electronic goods \u2013 from iphones to speakers to fitbits\
  \ to whatnots, at one-third the price! While the authenticity of these goods were\
  \ highly debatable, yet these sellers seemed to be attracting many customers! By\
  \ 4:30 am the market was gathering a crowd as it got difficult to move around without\
  \ running into one another and  the air grew thick with noises of buyers haggling\
  \ with the sellers. Majority of the buyers were young and middle aged men; workers\
  \ in the city or in the nearby towns who were looking to cut the best of the deals;\
  \ few of the buyers were traders themselves who would purchase these items in bulk\
  \ from here and sell them off at far flung towns and villages at double the price.\n\
  We went about checking out the various wares at display, occasionally enquiring\
  \ on their price and quality until the market was started closing down by 7:30 am\
  \ when we walked out to the main street and ended our tour by having a heavy early\
  \ breakfast at one of the many old Iranian cafes at Null Bazaar, a grease-laden\
  \ keema pav and a sugar laced chai each!"
