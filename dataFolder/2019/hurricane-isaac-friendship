Text: "In August 2012 i left my job due to voluntary redundancy to finally achieve\
  \ my dream of backpacking around the world, the plan was to start in the USA then\
  \ China and then end up in New Zealand. In August 2012 after travelling through\
  \ Brooklyn and Philadelphia i found myself in what i would call my first major adventure,\
  \ New Orleans Louisiana. Out in the middle of nowhere i thought, nothing mainstream\
  \ like New York, once i checked into my Hotel (There were huge problems finding\
  \ a hostel in New Orleans back then), i found myself wondering the backstreets of\
  \ New Orleans, like a complete tourist searching for the french quarter, encountering\
  \ Pimps, prostitutes and CD Peddlers.\n\nI finally found the french quarter and\
  \ Bourbon street, enjoying the kind of night thousands of others have, Hurricanes,\
  \ Lap dancing bars, getting to know strangers. The following morning a bath was\
  \ interrupted by dozens of cockroaches in my poorly chosen hotel, so i scrambled\
  \ outside only to encounter the kind of weather i had never seen in Britain before,\
  \ Heavy swirling wind and rain, the kind that knocks a man of his balance, with\
  \ the hangover i really thought nothing of it, the following day i ventured into\
  \ the hotel bar for a couple drinks getting to know the barman and watching the\
  \ weather report, it very quickly became apparent, my travel plans were in trouble\
  \ and so was New Orleans, i remembered the scenes on the news back home when watching\
  \ Hurricane Katrina, i was due to fly out the from New Orleans the following day\
  \ to Chicago, but the news informed my that the airport was shut, the barman advising\
  \ me to get my things and arrange urgent transport as quickly as i could, i ran\
  \ as fast as i could to the Amtrack station, getting the last available ticket to\
  \ Los Angles, a trip taking 47 hours!\n\nAfter much rushing around a frenzied 7/11\
  \ where people were wiping the stock clean, i hope on board the Sunset Limited,\
  \ upon reaching Lafayette i saw a beautiful girl getting her suitcase on board and\
  \ in a complete 360 of what would ever happen back home, upon being caught...erm....\"\
  looking\" the girl Jennifer came and sat down next to me, a real life American beauty,\
  \ complete with the Louisiana accent, we got talking, she along with the rest of\
  \ the locals on board (most evacuating the storm) were amused at my tiny portable\
  \ DVD player and 'Married with Children' boxset i was carrying. Me and Jen spent\
  \ hours sat next to each other watching, Houston, San Antonio and Del rio pass by,\
  \ with me smitten with Jen but also dying to get off at each stop and uncover America.\
  \ \n\nAt the Houston stop a guy name Jake came on board with his young son Braxton,\
  \ Jake also took a shine to Jennifer pestering me to leave them alone even though\
  \ i know Jen didn't want that and leaving me (a stranger!) to babysit Braxton, all\
  \ four of us even got off for a bear and a under the bridge harmonica sing song\
  \ in San Antonio, during a train refuel.\n\nMore stops passed by Tuson Arizona,\
  \ Lordsburg, as a huge fan of the west i yearned to get off at each stop but didn't\
  \ want to leave Jen. The whole train even had a sing a long and games on board as\
  \ there was a real sense of community on board as the majority had got on in Louisiana.\
  \ As the train whistled towards Palm Springs, which was to be Jennifers departure\
  \ to meet some friends, i stupidly declined the chance to get off there, for some\
  \ unknown reason caring more about my small deposit on a Hollywood Hostel than continuing\
  \ a detoured adventure \n\nWe eventually hugged goodbye and a little teary eyed\
  \ passed Facebook details back and fourth as i watched Jennifer depart. I arrived\
  \ in LA a little sad but i look back on the trip fondly still sending messages to\
  \ Jen even to this day dreaming one day of seeing Louisiana and her again!"
