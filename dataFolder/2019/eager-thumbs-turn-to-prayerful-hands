Text: "Whilst my previous days research told me my bus from Rivas to Playa Gigante\
  \ was due at 2pm, the vivacious Nicaraguan locals tried to persuade me otherwise\
  \ on arrival. They began pouring promises that there was in fact no bus travelling\
  \ there today, instead offering their trusted taxi services to take me for a nominal\
  \ fee. \nA fellow attractant of the cheerily eager locals, a young German named\
  \ Severin, assured my withering confidence that the bus at 2pm did exist and that\
  \ he would accompany me until then. After a quiet beer and the standard travellers\u2019\
  \ introductions, he suggested that while we wait for the bus to arrive, we try our\
  \ hand at hitch-hiking to the playa. A veteran of the craft, he assured me it was\
  \ standard practice in the country and regaled his previous successes. Still green\
  \ and excited to have made my first solo travel partner, I acquiesced. \n\nSingle\
  \ direct routes branched off the main road a few miles inland to each beach along\
  \ the coast like the arms of a grasshopper crawling along the shores. Along its\
  \ body we strode for all of thirty seconds before thumbing our first truck and hitching\
  \ a ride in the tray, as he too was headed for Gigante. We hopped in, collecting\
  \ a young family along the way who huddled into the back with us, grinning widely\
  \ at our pale skin and broken Spanish. They seemed excited by us, enthused by our\
  \ accents, or perhaps my blonde curly hair and wispy moustache. Arriving at Playa\
  \ Gigante, electric with excitement after my first ever hitch-hike, I tossed my\
  \ bag off the side of the truck and thanked the driver in the most sincere Spanish\
  \ I could muster. His white teeth shone amidst his dark, caramel skin. \n\nFollowing\
  \ three nights repose, coastlines further north beckoned me onwards. I marched towards\
  \ the one direct route out to the grasshoppers back and began trudging along its\
  \ long, spindly legs. An immediate thong blowout* did little to quell my motivation\
  \ and beaming positivity. A 1.5 hour walk and three successful thumbs later, I arrived\
  \ in Popoyo beach completely hooked on my new mode of transport. Days later I trudged\
  \ along the beach further, arriving in Guasacate where I settled with some old friends\
  \ before making plans to travel to Leon, a 3-hour straight drive from where I was\
  \ stationed.\n\n(*Thong Blowout: Australian idiom- to break the straps on a pair\
  \ of flip-flops/sandals)\n\nHere I met Hanneke who also had plans to travel to Leon\
  \ the following day and still beaming from my recent success, I assured I could\
  \ have her seated in a hostel dorm before sundown, riding simply on the kindness\
  \ of this country\u2019s strangers. Setting off amid amber skies, our first ride\
  \ came within seconds but only took us a few miles. \nFive scorching hours of luckless\
  \ walking later, it was clear I had oversimplified our trek. I had failed to realise\
  \ my chosen route was as barren as it was desolate, only used for local traffic\
  \ delivering fruit to isolated homes. We spoke endlessly on our walk- Hanneke told\
  \ me of her relationship with her father whom shared her love for exercise and the\
  \ outdoors, assuaging my guilt somewhat for having dragged her along with me. As\
  \ temperatures rose, optimism fell. \n\nOur thumbs soon became prayerful hands,\
  \ begging for cars to stop and take us with them. I apologised relentlessly for\
  \ promising so much and Hanneke grudgingly accepted, offering a meek but sincere\
  \ reception. Until one stranger granted me the ability to fulfil what I had promised.\
  \ She was heading to Managua, the nations\u2019 capital, and could take us as far\
  \ as the highway turn off. As we swung our bags into the tray, nothing could compare\
  \ to our shared, overjoyed relief. Hanneke leaned over and hugged me tightly as\
  \ the car took off and through stiff, nervous exhales I apologised again, assuring\
  \ her that once we were on the highway I was happy to concede defeat, find a bus\
  \ station and pay for the rest of our journey into Leon. \nShe beamed, \u201CActually,\
  \ I\u2019m happy to keep thumbing if you are\u201D"
