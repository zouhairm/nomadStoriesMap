Text: "We were high up in the sky with the dazzling white snowy landscapes below disappearing\
  \ gradually out of sight. We  left severe wintry Ukraine behind and were heading\
  \ South where January was mild and brought sunkissed tangerines, clear blue sky\
  \ and neat dry pavements. My mind though wasn't much occupied with the trivial ideas\
  \ of what amazing pleasures the Mediterranean climate would offer to such plain\
  \ nomads as we actually were. Then we had some other life challenges to face. The\
  \ matter of mere hours, I estimated. The whole life and the whole inner world of\
  \ my dearest living creature, who was now excitedly looking into the sunlit Boeing\
  \ window, were at stake. The cottonlike clouds outside looked cozily soft which\
  \ made it seem as if the plane was being carried away by the mysterious heavenly\
  \ powers. \nMy thoughts were eventually interrupted by a gentle voice. It sounded\
  \ very polite so undoubtedly must have belonged to one of the cabin crew. With his\
  \ pleasant smile on, a young male flight attendant offered us something to drink\
  \ and eat. Travelling with budget airlines means you are the one to choose between\
  \ paying extra for the luxury of having snacks and beverages or just keeping a three-hour\
  \ fast. So I simply went for two carton cups of boiling water and grabbed out of\
  \ my tote bag our thoroughly packed lunch with cold sandwiches, cherry croissants,\
  \ tea bags and sugarsticks. The passenger beside me, who was a middle-aged woman\
  \ with a kind face, obviously got astonished so much that she immediately asked.\n\
  'Is it allowed to take food with you on board?'\n'Of course,' I replied and jokingly\
  \ added: 'That's how, in fact, we survive here. By the way, would you like some\
  \ tea, too?'\nShe refused explaining she had already taken her medication and at\
  \ this point we started making conversation. I felt I was not just passing the time\
  \ of the day but I was sincerely interested in what Oksana told me about her life\
  \ in Greece for over 15 years.  She was a Ukrainian migrant working in a fish tavern\
  \ in Nea Makria, a vibrant coastal area of Athens, much popular with wealthy locals\
  \ and picky foreign tourists. \nTime flew together with the aircraft and soon my\
  \ son Yan exclaimed, 'There is the water below!' I leaned over to the window. Greece,\
  \ which we last visited almost 9 years ago, had still its special charms, I thought.\
  \ With its thousands of paradise islands, blue salty waters all around, priceless\
  \ artefacts of the greatest ancient civilization, fresh seafood and unique roast\
  \ lamb this country would remain second to none for many years to come.\nAfter landing\
  \ at Eleftherios Venizelos we took an aerobus to the huge white airport terminal.\
  \ Looking at the directions on the blue signs inside I felt anxious and when we\
  \ approached the passport control area I could hardly stay calm. As holders of Ukrainian\
  \ biopassports we could travel visa-free within Shengen but as non-European nationals\
  \ we had to go through routine border procedures. Waiting in a queue with our carry-on\
  \ luggage and warm coats on made it even more unbearable. My hands were shaking\
  \ nervously when it was our turn to go through the control. The border officer was\
  \ a young dark-haired man who looked indeed friendly. He asked me a question about\
  \ where we had arrived from, typed something on the computer, stamped our passports\
  \ and wishing us good luck gave them back. \nAt the moving luggage carousel, just\
  \ before stepping outside the white automatic door, I asked Yan to hang on for a\
  \ while.\n'Look, Yan, just behind that exit, there is a person waiting for us,'\
  \ I started with a lump in my throat.\n'I know I have to behave myself, mum. I promise\
  \ I will,' he hurriedly commented.\n'That's not the point, son.' I was almost crying\
  \ but taking a deep breath went on. \n'He is your father.'\n'Really?' he stared\
  \ at me in disbelief.\n'Yes, he is.'\n'Great. Now I can tell everybody at school\
  \ I've got a father!'\nWithout saying anything, I picked up our bag, took Yan's\
  \ hand and we left to enter a new chapter of his life."
