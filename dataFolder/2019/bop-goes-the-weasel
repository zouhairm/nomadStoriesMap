Text: "The air was cold and grays filled the sky on the morning that we had set out\
  \ to see The East Side Gallery of the infamous Berlin Wall. We\u2019d heard about\
  \ how artists had flocked to paint their murals onto it soon after it was broken\
  \ down, to shed light on its haunting history, that the River Spree that flowed\
  \ behind it culminated the experience perfectly. We were excited to finally see\
  \ what we had read about in our history books all these years.\n\nAs we were making\
  \ our way to the metro station, I got a call from my mother:\n\u201CKeep your wallet\
  \ in your front pocket.\u201D She warned me.\n\u201CDon\u2019t carry too much money\
  \ around and stay together at all times.\u201D\n\n\u201CYes, yes don\u2019t worry\
  \ Ma, we\u2019ll be fine!\u201D I assured her, knowing very well I had clumsily\
  \ stuffed my entire \u2018Trip to Germany\u2019 allowance into my wallet.\n\nWe\
  \ got down at the M\xFChlenstra\xDFe station and headed to the Gallery to see it\
  \ being flocked by tourists. The murals were beautiful and diverse \u2013 from artists\
  \ celebrating their hobbies to political satires. We overheard tourist guides telling\
  \ tragic tales about separated families and lost lovers.\nAs we continued to walk\
  \ along the wall, I heard a funny noise that came from a distance:\n\n\u201CBOP\
  \ BOP BOP BOP...\u201D\n\nI looked in that direction to see a man surrounded by\
  \ a swarm of people. My friend walked passed them as I curiously made my way through\
  \ the crowd. I got to the front to find a man in a black coat and brown pants on\
  \ his knees, switching 5 or 6 overturned cups at high speeds, going \u201CBOP\u201D\
  \ for every switch that he made. I learned that there was a ball under a cup and\
  \ the person who could point out the cup under which it was would win 100 Euros,\
  \ but one guess would cost 50 Euros. It sounded like a good deal to me and I\u2019\
  m not quite sure what made me conspicuous in the crowd but the man looked up at\
  \ me:\n\n\u201CWant to win money?\u201D \n\n\u201CYes\u201D I hesitated.\n\n\u201C\
  50 Euros, tell me where the ball is\u201D\n\nSo I anxiously grabbed my wallet out\
  \ of my pocket and handed him a 50.\n\n\u201CPay close attention\u201D he warned\
  \ me, as he pointed out to my nervous eyes and then to the cups.\n\n\u201CBOP BOP\
  \ BOP BOP..\u201D he went on as I tried my best to keep my eyes on the cup over\
  \ the ball, and just before he stopped, I saw the ball under one of the cups.\n\n\
  \u201CWhere is the ball?\u201D he interrogated.\n\n I pointed out to the cup confidently,\
  \ all ready to win some extra money for my trip in Germany, and he lifted it only\
  \ to reveal that it was empty. I was in shock:\n\n\u201C50 Euros.. that is\u2026\
  \ um\u2026 how much is that in rupees? Um\u2026 1 Euro is about 80 Rupees.. that\
  \ means 50 into 80.. um... that\u2019s 4,000 Rupees.\u201D I began freaking out\
  \ in my head.\n\n\u201CBOP BOP BOP BOP..\u201D he went on with his game as people\
  \ lost and won money.\n\nHe caught me in my daze and asked me if I wanted to win\
  \ my money back, and I agreed, I thought that maybe I had made a mistake the first\
  \ time and that I would win this time, and just as I said \u201CYes\u201D he snatched\
  \ 150 from my wallet:\n\n\u201CJackpot, Jackpot! 500 Euros if you win!\u201D and\
  \ in my daze, it still sounded like a good deal, but before I knew it, I had lost\
  \ 200 Euros. An Old Dutchman put his hand around my trembling shoulders and nudged\
  \ the crowd away to pull me out.\n\n\u201CYou haff loshd a lod ouf money. He ish\
  \ cheading you.\u201D He said and walked away. \n\nI walked the rest of the Gallery\
  \ until I reached the River, and sat there as I stared at the water reflecting the\
  \ grays of the sky. Little did I expect to find myself at the Berlin Wall; a place\
  \ where artists have spent years trying to erase the haunting memories, only to\
  \ create a memory that would haunt me forever."
