Text: "I didn't grab the camera in time. I continued to stare at every detail to instead\
  \ engrave the image in my mind. It was raining and we were driving back from Hangzhou\
  \ beside the serene West Lake. There were mountains in the far background with a\
  \ layer of fog, that was not covering the view,but instead enhancing the sight of\
  \ the large rain drops. People were walking in a single file; it was evident the\
  \ path was narrow enough for only one person. Each person was carrying a umbrella\
  \ - colorful umbrellas scurry across this mystical view. \n\nWe were headed back\
  \ to Yiwu, China, where we were staying and what the locals referred to as a \u201C\
  town\u201D even though it has a population of over a million. However, that wasn't\
  \ the thing that struck me as odd, it was the fact that every sign and banner in\
  \ Yiwu was not only written in Mandarin but also in Arabic. This fact was ironic\
  \ because I was on this trip with my mom and aunt who were fluent in Arabic, me\
  \ not so much being born and raised in Canada. Here I was with my tourist book in\
  \ one hand and mandarin to English google translate on my phone in the other hand\
  \ and all did not matter. It turns out a majority of the people spoke arabic; the\
  \ locals refer to all of them as foreigners. Thinking I would be relying on locals\
  \ to guild us, here we were relying on foreigners to translate from Arabic to Mandarin.\
  \  \n\nWe spent a large amount of our trip at Yiwu International Trade Building.\
  \ During lunch, in front of the building, there was a lady wearing a hijab searing\
  \ meat on sticks. The handwritten sign hung from the grill read \u201Chalal meat\u201D\
  . This was only one encounter with a foreigner. Each encounter different but each\
  \ story similar relating to how they have immigrated from their homeland to China\
  \ to find work and to provide for their families. \n\nWhen the day was finished,\
  \ we stepped outside the building only to realize it was pouring rain. We stood\
  \ in the rain and tried to get a cab as we saw hundreds of locals all with umbrellas\
  \ or raincoats even those riding motorcycles had giant raincoats in the style of\
  \ a poncho covering two passengers as well as the motorcycle itself. A cycle rickshaw\
  \ powered by a motor stopped and asked if we need a ride. Although questioning its\
  \ safety we decided to get in. My aunt started laughing saying she came to China\
  \ to ride on a \u201Ctuk-te-ka\u201D which was what they called these driving wagons\
  \ in Syria. We laughed at the experience as my aunt reminisced on her childhood\
  \ memory of riding a \u201Ctuk-te-ka\u201D in Syria. \n\nBack at the Yiwu Byland\
  \ World Hotel, I sat at the lounge, where instead of serving you cold water like\
  \ in Western countries, they serve you hot water. Sipping on my hot water, the waiter,\
  \ whom was a local, said \u201CMarhaba\u201D which translates to \u201CGreetings\u201D\
  \ in Arabic. I told him my mom caught a cold and that I wanted to get her some soup.\
  \ He repeated the words \u201Cno problem no problem\u201D and abruptly pulls out\
  \ a small note pad that had random scribbles and numbers makes a call to a takeout\
  \ restaurant that was near by. We step outside of the lobby and it was raining.\
  \ Out of nowhere, he opens up a black umbrella and holds it over my head. I smiled\
  \ at his kind gesture. \n\nIt is only now that I have compiled the vivid memories\
  \ of the trip that I realized the best ones were in the rain. What connects us all\
  \ is the hustle of working for our basic needs, having similar goals related to\
  \ family, the stories that the foreigners exchanged that related to the same stories\
  \ as my mom and aunt's immigrating to Canada. These periodic struggles of living\
  \ and surviving parallel the way we scurry through the heavy rain trying not to\
  \ get too wet and continue through our path until we reach our next dry and comforting\
  \ destination."
