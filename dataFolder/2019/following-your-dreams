Text: "Where to began......I have always been a dreamer, I set goals for myself and\
  \ it takes me a long time to make those goals a reality. In 2017 I finally decision\
  \ to stop talking about it and just do it, so I booked flights to New York City\
  \ to try and chase my dreams of having one of my theatre plays performed in New\
  \ York. It was scary, especially doing this all alone. I have never been alone overseas\
  \ before, I have been overseas heaps of times but I have never been alone. It's\
  \ scary, but it's something that has made me grow up and become a better person.\
  \ \n\nWhen I first arrived in New York City, I found out how huge the city is. The\
  \ line up just to see the airport staff was huge and I mean huge! I waited about\
  \ two/half hours in line. I finally got to the front of the line and if you know\
  \ me I get pretty nervous and the airport staff member knew I was nervous. He didn't\
  \ know me all he could see was a nervous twenty-eight year old with a beard and\
  \ a backpack trying to get through customs. So he called over his co-worker and\
  \ I got more nervous because I didn't know what was going on. I was called into\
  \ a room and I was told to wait until my name was called. It was so scary. \nI looked\
  \ around and I could see a couple of people just waiting for there name to be called,\
  \ I was thinking I am no criminal, I haven't done anything wrong. Anyway after 30mins\
  \ I finally saw the guy at the desk and he asked me three questions, I must have\
  \ answered them really well because I was finally able to leave. \n\nIt was about\
  \ 12:30am and I was in the tax to my accommodation I wrote down the address to give\
  \ the taxi driver so that was all sorted I can finally relax. The taxi driver must\
  \ have got confused because he was driving around for a long time, he finally gave\
  \ up and told me it was just around the corner and I will be ok. So I got out of\
  \ the car and started walking around the neighbourhood in the middle of the night\
  \ with my big backpack and no idea where I was going. I reckon I was walking around\
  \ for about an hour trying to find this place. Anyway I eventually found it and\
  \ I eventually got to sleep in a comfortable bed. \n\nThe next day, I said to myself\
  \ this isn't happening again I am getting a sim card with GPS on it so I don't get\
  \ lost again. I did get lost so many more times on my trip but I learnt to be calm.\
  \ So I did, throughout my New York City trip I learnt a lot, I learnt to have plans\
  \ after plans after plans. If one of your plans fails then go to your backup plan\
  \ and keep going. I learnt that I can do things on my own and I am stronger then\
  \ I thought I was. \n\nThe beautiful thing about this whole trip is I got to share\
  \ my play with creatives in New York City and Philadelphia which is a dream come\
  \ true for me. All those hard times I experienced in my trip was all worth it. Don't\
  \ give up on your dreams"
