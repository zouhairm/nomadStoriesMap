Text: "Happy birthday! These screams awoke me to smiling faces and water-holding hands\
  \ ready to wash off the old year and present me brand new to my new age. This was\
  \ more than a dream so let\u2019s go some hours back.\n\u201CMr. Marvel\u201D...\
  \ I stood up from my seat in the waiting lounge of the bus terminal where I was\
  \ waiting with fellow delegates, to greet my friend who sent me the link to this\
  \ opportunity in the first place. \u201CEmmanuel\u2026\u201D was all he said as\
  \ we shared a warm embrace to cover for the past sixteen months we hadn\u2019t seen\
  \ ourselves. We made light conversation as we welcomed other delegates and got ready\
  \ to move. Voices I had chatted with for over three months were finally being matched\
  \ with their beautiful faces. These were my fellow delegates for the Model ECOWAS\
  \ Summit 2018 edition holding on Ghana, we were team Nigeria and this was our road\
  \ trip to Ghana.\nWe passed through the Benin Republic where life seemed \u201C\
  easy and carefree\u201D. Checkpoints passed, onward bound, we sailed to Togo. Oh,\
  \ how we longed to make a stop at the beach that held promises of fun, water, and\
  \ laughter, but we had a clock to beat. I made a mental note to stop by this beach\
  \ on our return trip, even if I had to talk everyone into it, I later discovered\
  \ that this thought was harbored by my fellow delegates. Finally, we got to \u201C\
  Aflao border\u201D at about 16:00 hours and now had five hours to beat, we were\
  \ headed for Accra city. Suddenly, the relationship between Naira and Cedis became\
  \ real to us as we saw the glaring difference, no one needed to tell me \u2013 every\
  \ \u201Cpesewa\u201D mattered; but this trip still had much to offer.\nLights! This\
  \ was the sight that greeted our eyes (then I knew for sure that the stories about\
  \ Ghana\u2019s constant electricity were, in fact, true). This was much appreciated\
  \ since we arrived in the night. We met other delegates upon arrival, and the Ghanaians\
  \ too, it was a mind-blowing moment to share. Later on, with sights on my mind and\
  \ joy in my heart, I forgot that I hadn\u2019t eaten since noon \u2013 I drifted\
  \ off to with a smile on my face.\nBirthday. I felt loved, joyful and elated to\
  \ be celebrating a new age with friends (old and new), team members, and a new nation.\
  \ But most importantly, I felt challenged \u2013the first time I stepped outside\
  \ the shores of my country was on the day of my birth, it dawned on me that this\
  \ was some sort of rebirth for me and a tradition I would have to uphold every other\
  \ year. But my thoughts were just for me as we sped through the day in the speed\
  \ of light from sight-seeing and touring landmarks (like the Kwame Nkrumah Mausoleum)\
  \ to an amazing dinner at a place called \u201CBOSPHOROUS\u201D.\nFinal day. At\
  \ this point, I was full of new experiences, friends, and memories, but one particular\
  \ moment stood out for me. I went outside the conference hall to take some pictures\
  \ with team members, then one of my new-found friends walked up to me and one thing\
  \ led to the other, forty-five minutes sped by. On the way of returning to our lodges,\
  \ she thanked me for a wonderful time of listening and sharing. In her words \u201C\
  \u2026at a point in your life, you need friends that when you look back after ten\
  \ years, you are still friends\u201D. Right there, our connection deepened and I\
  \ unknowingly replied: \u201C\u2026not often are we blessed with this miracle, let\u2019\
  s beat history\u201D. The rest, they say, is \u2026 not history, but our reality.\
  \ \nHonestly, my trip to Ghana was a leap into the unknown and indeed I made some\
  \ local connections with the land, the people and the culture (especially at the\
  \ museum where I saw Africa in capital letters \u2013 say Africapitalism). But I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find a ten years friendship challenge. Now in Present day,\
  \ a few months down the line, our friendship still borders through distance and\
  \ time. And you may ask \u201Cwhat about her name?\u201D\u2026 I\u2019ll tell on\
  \ the next trip."
