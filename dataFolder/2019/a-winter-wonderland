Text: "The second you land at the airport, you are taken back to being 9 on Christmas\
  \ Eve. You have landed in Santa\u2019s town. Walking through the airport doors the\
  \ icy atmosphere hits your rosy cheeks and all you can see roads, cars and trees\
  \ covered in billions of white snowflakes. The first thought that went through my\
  \ head was the scenes in the movies ARE REAL!! First stop from the airport was visiting\
  \ Santa\u2019s Village In Rovaniemi. You can spot the red roof villaiage with the\
  \ million fairy lights miles away. It\u2019s like a dream come true. You will find\
  \ two shops filled with Santa toys and memorabilia, on the other end you will find\
  \ a small little store which is referred to Santa\u2019s post office, here you can\
  \ buy post cards and post it back home, you can also write your own letter and and\
  \ post it here, your family will\nHave a letter with a stamp on stating from the\
  \ North Pole Santa\u2019s village!! The best part is yet to come ... meeting Santa!!\
  \ Santa speak every single language, here you will stand in line to be able to sit\
  \ on Santa\u2019s lap, tell him what you would like for Christmas and take a photo\
  \ with him. I absolutely love Christmas and there isn\u2019t any better way to start\
  \ a Christmas holiday off than meeting the real deal! Once you done meeting Santa\
  \ the next stop can only be, what Santa uses to visit the entire world on a Christmas\
  \ Eve - meeting rudolf. Although I think at this stage being inside the article\
  \ circle my nose is much redder than Rudolfs. At the rain deer village you get to\
  \ sit inside a proper self build wooden teepee around a flaming little fire, where\
  \ you get to hear all the stories and history about all Santa\u2019s reindeer\u2019\
  s while sipping on finish coffee. The real excitement started when we were told\
  \ we going to be able to go on a rain deer slay ride through the magical forest!\
  \  You would think being in the lowest of low degrees of -12 outside that you will\
  \ be a snowman but you won\u2019t... haha you get to sit on a soft rain deer skin\
  \ and you will be wrapped up in the softest wool blanket. Being all Cosied up you\
  \ will be led through the magical first, with the sun only being up for 2 hours\
  \ a day in winter it\u2019s the perfect time, the million white snow flakes will\
  \ look like blue glitter as been melted into them with the sun rays shining on them.\
  \ It\u2019s the most peaceful, relaxing atmosphere, some guest even took a snooze,\
  \ I think that demented the most how relaxing the experience is. After the ride\
  \ we were invited to Lucky Ranch, they make their own ice igloos to sleep in, how\
  \ can you not go for the full experience in this magical country?! For dinner we\
  \ had a proper finish braai where Anti the ranch owner made us the most succulent\
  \  salmon and raindeer I have ever eaten. Raindeer was the first but really worth\
  \ a try. Apparently there are more raindeer than people in Finland but still hard\
  \ to get past the thought that it\u2019s Santas helper. This is really an experience\
  \ that you cannot go without trying. Living in the fairy tale we all dream about\
  \ as kids meeting Santa and his raindeer, there isn\u2019t a better way to spend\
  \ Christmas with your family or if you are like me Christmas craze I would immediately\
  \ book tickets to come and life out and experience the fairy tale you have always\
  \ dreamt about as a kid! It\u2019s worth every penny."
