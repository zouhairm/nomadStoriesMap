Text: "\u201EOne day,... I saw the sunset forty-four times. You know - one loves the\
  \ sunset, when one is so sad...\"*\nSo maybe I was really sad. I thought while repeating\
  \ the Little Prince's words in my mind. I felt this unreciprocated love for nature\
  \ while it was being so cold to me in January. These abnormally short days and long\
  \ nights and vice-versa, created such a spectacle of colours in the skies of Helsinki.\
  \ I had never experienced the importance of light and its magic, until I realized\
  \ that I had been taking it for granted. I stood there, staring at the shore from\
  \ the steep Kaivopuisto park on the Southern extremes of the city. The beauty in\
  \ front of me kept me from freezing. I had never thought that a breathtaking scenery\
  \ could make one so resistant to everything that could crush one physically. The\
  \ apogee of colours made me forget I existed. My mind was full of first world problems\
  \ that got wiped away while appreciating every drowning sun-ray below the horizon\
  \ at the Baltic shore. My body began to heat up from what my eyes were transmitting\
  \ to it. And I felt the warmth again. The epic spectacle of the darkness taking\
  \ over the day was everything but sad. I embraced the sun once more before it went\
  \ to sleep, and I left.\n\n...\n\n- Drive a bit faster, please; we need to arrive\
  \ before they go to bed, so we can make our way to the island.\n- But it\xB4s okay,\
  \ it\xB4s early...- I said.\n- It is almost eleven p.m.!\nMy jaw dropped to my knees\
  \ while we were approaching the cabin on one of the small islands within the Pielinen\
  \ lake in North Karelia. It was July in the North. We had been travelling for hours\
  \ without seeing anything else but pine trees and immerse quantities of light. On\
  \ the following day I met the glorious Sir Johnathan - a seagull, who returned to\
  \ the floating bridge at the island's front-line every summer to enjoy some of the\
  \ food that his fluffy ginger fellow Sulo- the cat, would leave untouched. They\
  \ both became my local friends. Detached from all utilities that facilitate our\
  \ daily life, I discovered the \"Kalevala\"** which revealed to my imagination the\
  \ mysterious world of the creation of the Finns. I then realised that Nordic minimalism\
  \ and humbleness were just an attempt to show sobriety that conceals a whole different\
  \ dimension of spiritualism and curiosity for what's beyond the obvious. By the\
  \ end of this journey, I was convinced that the dark cliffs, formed by powerful\
  \ ancient upheavals in Karelia\u2019s National Park Koli, were sleeping rocky giants\
  \ covered with moss. It felt like they were breathing below my feet - and no wonder\
  \ they all had human names. This land was so overwhelming with mystery and glory.\n\
  - See these trees?\n\_I nodded.\_\n- Aspen trees- we call them \u201Chaapa\u201D\
  . They look as if their leafs are dancing with the wind. My mom loved the sound\
  \ they are making.\nI found myself in the middle of nowhere, feeling like every\
  \ branch was talking to me, while this handsome blond man with plump red lips was\
  \ pointing up, looking surreal in the infinity of the day. No wonder Finns got stigmatized\
  \ for being cold. Their bright, reflecting the light, eyes would always somehow\
  \ create a barrier to their delicate souls, hidden under tens of woollen layers.\
  \ A year was not enough to completely understand them but I had to leave.\n\n*\"\
