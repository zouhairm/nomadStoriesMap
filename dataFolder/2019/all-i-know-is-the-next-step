Text: "Victoria had her life planned, and the plan was going swimmingly. She was less\
  \ than two months away from finishing her college diploma, and even had a job lined\
  \ up for work in her field that would start right after her graduation. She had\
  \ worked so hard to get to where she was, but the day after her twenty-first birthday\
  \ everything fell apart. She was forced to make the difficult decision to withdraw\
  \ from school, and forced to turn down her official job offer the same day she signed\
  \ the withdrawal papers. This was also the day she found out she had been accepted\
  \ to a gap semester program in Thailand that she had halfheartedly applied for two\
  \ months prior. With life seeming aimless, and no contingency plan for life after\
  \ she returned home, she accepted her place in the gap semester and prepared to\
  \ move from Canada to Southeast Asia for three months.\nShe had always dreamed of\
  \ travel, and even of living abroad, but never had she anticipated something like\
  \ this. She had thought she\u2019d move to somewhere in Europe and work in her field\
  \ in an English-speaking country. Now she was pouring over the pages of her Thai\
  \ language phrasebook, trying to learn a tonal language when no one around her could\
  \ speak Thai. At only twenty-one years old and living with her parents to save money,\
  \ she had never lived independently; now she was preparing to live in another country\
  \ where she wasn\u2019t sure what her accommodation setting would be, only that\
  \ she would be living in community with five other women in their late teens that\
  \ she had never met before. When she arrived in Thailand and began to spend every\
  \ moment of every day with these women, she realized they were all there for a common\
  \ purpose: to find answers, and meaning for their life.\nThe gap semester would\
  \ be twelve intense weeks studying and getting hands-on experience in the Red Light\
  \ District in Phuket, Thailand. She had never seen anything like it, nothing could\u2019\
  ve prepared her for what she saw walking down Patong Beach. She was struck by how\
  \ normalized the sex industry was, how the Moulin Rouge nightclub was located right\
  \ beside a McDonald\u2019s restaurant. Couples walked down the street, holding their\
  \ children. People stood with their baskets in the street, selling toys inspired\
  \ by Frozen and the minions from Despicable Me; when right beside them would be\
  \ cigarettes available for purchase and someone waving a sign advertising the sex\
  \ shows in their club. She would look at these signs, and then look into the eyes\
  \ of the person holding it. What she saw was completely devoid of emotion; she felt\
  \ as though she was looking into the eyes of a corpse. These people had no joy or\
  \ sadness in their eyes, they had lost all sense of purpose for themselves, let\
  \ go of their dreams; all they wanted was to earn enough money to send home to their\
  \ families. Through her gap semester program, Victoria had the opportunity to see\
  \ restorative efforts made to help the girls in the bars on Patong.\nThe very same\
  \ week she had arrived in Thailand, two vocational schools had begun in the same\
  \ building she was living in; four Thai girls learning to be bakers, and four learning\
  \ to be hairdressers. The building is also home to a Child Advocacy Centre, that\
  \ has the goal of rescuing children from traffickers and providing the help that\
  \ the children need. The organization also partners with the FBI and the Thai police,\
  \ working to bring justice to the people who would dehumanize and traffic these\
  \ women and children. Seeing the work being done to help these oppressed people,\
  \ Victoria feels a call to action. Perhaps she will pursue a degree in psychology\
  \ and work with exploited women and children. Perhaps she could become a hairdresser\
  \ herself and return as a teacher in the salon. Or maybe her place is to share the\
  \ story of the incredible work she\u2019s seen being done in Thailand. And that\
  \ brings her one step closer to finding answers that she travelled so far to find."
