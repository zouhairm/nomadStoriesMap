Text: "She was with us in Egypt, she was with us in Spain. She laughed and joked with\
  \ me and my siblings while crossing the Old Bridge in Heidelberg, and she loved\
  \ to drink \"caf\xE9 Le Walt\" with my dad in Paris. But this time, when we showed\
  \ the boarding passes to get inside the plane, there wasn't a pass with her name.\
  \ My mom died of a very rare disease and this was our first christmas without her.\
  \ Therefore, we decided to go away from M\xE9xico, where we live, in an attempt\
  \ to leave the sadness behind us so we ended up in New York to spend the holidays.\n\
  \nNaturally we went to all the tourist places and ate a lot of hamburgers and those\
  \ street hot-dogs that appears in the tv shows, but we also tried to explored the\
  \ city. One night, while my dad stayed in the hotel to rest, my brothers and I walked\
  \ until we found a bar that made you feel like you were in the 20\u2019s and decided\
  \ to try it out. We were talking while my siblings drinked beer and I, an abstemious\
  \ tiny woman, had a lemonade. It was the first time in a long time that we were\
  \ truly relax. There wasn\u2019t the stress of my mom\u2019s disease, no school\
  \ or job, we didn\u2019t had to deal with nothing except for what would be the next\
  \ drink\u2026 It was all calm and joy in a Manhattan bar with brown and warm light,\
  \ a lot of woodwork and an empty counter with a quite barman.\n\nThe days passed\
  \ and finally the Christmas night arrived. We didn't knew where to have dinner and\
  \ the tiredness was such that there wasn\u2019t energy to look for a place. We ended\
  \ up in a restaurant that my dad remembered in Broadway; it\u2019s name was \u201C\
  Brasserie cognac\u201D and a friendly South American waiter attended us and told\
  \ a few funny comments in spanish. Everyone was happy and comfortable, so I thought\
  \ \u201CWhy not?\u201D and drank a strawberry-tini and listened to the talk while\
  \ being surprised of not \u200B\u200Bbeing sad in that city, in that day and without\
  \ her.\n\nBut the most unexpected peaceful moment, for me, during the travel was\
  \ the time we went to Madison Square and my dad saw a shop in the corner crossing\
  \ the street, so I went with him inside while my brothers continue going to The\
  \ Garden. At the moment we enter, a charismatic man said hello to us; his name was\
  \ Rahman, a pakistani who sold fine hats. He tried to convinced my dad to buy two\
  \ hats and made the uncomfortable mistake to assume that I was his partner; we immediately\
  \ corrected him and pointed out that we were father and daughter. A few minutes\
  \ later, my brothers arrived and Rahman got really excited. He told us that he has\
  \ four sons and one daughter (his little princess) and seeing our family makes him\
  \ happy; then, without leaving his smile of his face, explained that he missed his\
  \ country (specially the fields with cows and horses) and complained about the occidental\
  \ families being small, but ours was just like his.\n\nHe immediately related with\
  \ us and, to be honest, I never thought that I would relate with a man from Pakistan\
  \ in a shop full of hats and coats in New York. In Mexico, families are one of the\
  \ most valuable relationship in your life; and for what it looked like, it seem\
  \ that for Rahman a family is also one of the greatest treasures you can have and\
  \ must keep.\n\nSo there I was, in the middle of the shop, watching my dad and my\
  \ brothers trying to decide between a brown and grey hat, keeping an eye to the\
  \ field photos behind the counter (that I assume were from Pakistan) while being\
  \ happy and laughing with all those men who, in one way or another, always knew\
  \ how to made me smile in what I thought would be the saddest holiday of my life.\
  \ I don\u2019t have a mother anymore, but I'm making a lot of amazing new memories\
  \ with the rest of my family."
