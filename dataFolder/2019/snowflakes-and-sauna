Text: "My head is woozy and spinning from the vodka and desert-heat of the sauna.\
  \ The sting from the birch leaves lashing my back is almost welcome for its sobering\
  \ effect, despite the tiny lacerations that have turned my back into a cartographer\u2019\
  s map of fresh, red ink. \u201CThat\u2019s enough, I think\u201D I sputter to my\
  \ friend Masha in Russian. Despite, having lived in this exact apartment building\
  \ for half of her life and speaking fluent Finnish, she complains that her Finnish\
  \ counterparts still label her more \u201CRussian\u201D than Finnish. \"That\u2019\
  s one thing about living in Finland,\u201D she confided, \u201Cis that you will\
  \ never become Finnish, no longer how long you stay.\"\nA neighbour who also happens\
  \ to have signed the rota for sauna today, asks me in Russian, \u201CWhere are you\
  \ from?\u201D\n\u201CYou probably wouldn\u2019t know it- a small place in America\
  \ called Rehoboth beach, Delaware\u201D I quipped, sure that would end the line\
  \ of questioning.  \n\u201COh, no way. I worked there selling ice-cream one summer\u201D\
  \ the neighbour responds in natural English over our gasps.\nI shouldn\u2019t have\
  \ been surprised. Almost everyone I met in Helsinki thus far spoke in flawless English\
  \ with Friends-honed American accents that sent shivers down my spine. The number\
  \ of coincidences like these left me with the impression that Finns are some of\
  \ the best-travelled people in the world.\nMarja the neighbour offered us some refreshing-looking\
  \ cucumber-water, which in fact turned out to be vodka. I couldn\u2019t bring myself\
  \ why to ask the girls why, when practicing the art of sauna, it is customary to\
  \ fill one\u2019s body with toxins at an equal rate as you can sweat them out. \n\
  I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s a survival mechanism to survive the harsh climate,\
  \ or a manifestation of the Finnish self-proclaimed national spirit \u201Csisu\u201D\
  \ (interpreted as resilience, inner-strength, or the desire to overcome challenge),\
  \ but my perception of Finnish women is that they are fiercely loyal, independent,\
  \ and capable. All I know about Suomi men, on the other hand, is that they like\
  \ their privacy. My new Finnish friend Marja explained to me that men in her country\
  \ speak like they have a quota of words allowed per year and they don\u2019t want\
  \ to use them up all at once. \n\u201CIt\u2019s time!\u201D Masha said, running\
  \ for the exit. Not the door to the bathroom or shower as you might imagine, but\
  \ the exit to the outside world. In January. In Helsinki. She heaved open the heavy\
  \ door against the howling wind, allowing stray snowflakes and steam to fill up\
  \ the entry. On the count of three, the three of us streaked naked to the snow-bank\
  \ that piled up to our knees. Three snow angels later, we stood up icy and refreshed.\
  \ I looked up at the city sky, which incredibly boasted sparkly stars. One of them\
  \ winked at me, as if we shared a secret between us now and He wouldn\u2019t tell\
  \ anyone what he saw."
