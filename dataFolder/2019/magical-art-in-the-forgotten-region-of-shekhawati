Text: "working and saving for 9 years, I decided to quit my job. I wanted to give\
  \ time to myself, spend time with family, and travel to different places.\n\nFirst\
  \ destination on my mind was Rajasthan. I was so enthusiastic to explore the majestic\
  \ Rajasthan that I spent 1.5 months exploring Jaipur, Ranthambore, Bundi, Ajmer,\
  \ Pushkar, Chittaurgarh, Udaipur, Jodhpur, Jaisalmer, and Bikaner. \n\nWhen I was\
  \ in Bikaner, I met a rickshaw guy who was talkative. He was curious to know what\
  \ all I had seen in Rajasthan and after hearing about them he said - \"Sister, if\
  \ you do not visit Shekhawati region, you will miss out one of the most beautiful\
  \ regions of Rajasthan\".\n\nI returned to hostel and booked bus to Nawalgarh. I\
  \ neither had any insight about the region nor any expectations and I decided to\
  \ keep it that way.\n\nIt was a pleasant day of March and I arrived at Nawalgarh.\
  \ The place blew my mind. Almost every other house is an old haveli and each of\
  \ them are adorned with beautiful fresco paintings. Some of them are pristine where\
  \ as most are in deteriorated conditions.\n\nThe local guide said if you want to\
  \ see the glory of Nawalgarh you must visit 3 havelis - Morarka Haveli, Bhagat Haveli,\
  \ and Uttara Haveli. And trust me he was absolutely right.\n\nOur next destination\
  \ in Shekhawati was Mandawa which was equally beautiful as well. Jhunjhunwala haveli,\
  \ murmuria haveli, Bhinsidhar Nevatia haveli, Goenka Double Haveli and Mandawa fort\
  \ stood out among hundreds of havelis scattered around the area.\n\nThe third place\
  \ we explored was Fatehpur which was mind-boggling. Though we had seen many havelis,\
  \ Fatehpur surprised us with its simplicity. People were lovely and the city was\
  \ welcoming. Kedia haveli, Singhania haveli, Hanuman Prasad Nevatia haveli, and\
  \ Nadine Le Prince were among the best from the town.\n\nWhile I explored these\
  \ havelis I noticed that the subject of these paintings were mostly Indian. And\
  \ the paintings were mostly from 19 century.  Most paintings involved Lord Krishna.\
  \ His childhood and his incarnations being the most depicted of all. There were\
  \ also fresco paintings depicting scenes from other Indian mythologies like Ramayana\
  \ and Mahabharata. Local legendary stories, illustration of local culture, and many\
  \ other variety of paintings covered the walls of these extravagant havelis.\n\n\
  One most frequently noticed painting is the local legendary story of Dhola-Maru.\
  \  Dhola and Maru were married as children. Dhola returns to his village as an adult\
  \ to take his wife back. While riding on a camel they are attacked by bandits and\
  \ the brave Maru turns back and attacks them with arrows. \n\nOne must see these\
  \ fresco paintings to believe them. Some are so intricate and fine that art lovers\
  \ will be lost in them.\n\nThe city of some paintings were so fresh that I was wondering\
  \ how the colors remained so vibrant even after so many years.  And upon asking,\
  \ the guide shared an interesting information. The artists used only natural colors\
  \ mixed in lime water. The colors were beaten into the plaster of wall while it\
  \ was still wet so that the paintings became part of the plaster. That way the colors\
  \ survived all weather conditions even after hundreds of years.\n\nMost of the havelis\
  \ are abandoned by their owners as they settled in bigger cities. Some havelis are\
  \ looked after by caretakers, some locked down, and few converted into heritage\
  \ hotels. \n\nIf you are planning to visit Rajasthan State of India, make sure to\
  \ include Shekhawati in your list. This region will pleasantly surprise you with\
  \ its art, where as most other regions are about palaces, lakes, architecture and\
  \ desert.\n\nAnd when you are there make sure to contribute to the livelihood of\
  \ the locals. Buy from local shops and help the local businesses survive. \n\nIndia\
  \ is Incredible and I hope you enjoy the exploration of Rangeelo (colorful) Rajasthan.\
  \ Happy Travelling."
