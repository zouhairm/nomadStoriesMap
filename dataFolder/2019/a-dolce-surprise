Text: "A \u201Cdolce\u201D surprise.\n\nIn August 2017 I left my home and continent\
  \ for the first time since ever. As an Architecture student I risk to say  everyone\
  \ of us that study every day cities and their respective constructions arround the\
  \ world have a tremendous curiosity in discover new places, their organizations\
  \ and particularities.\nBut meet a new spot in the world it\u2019s not just \u201C\
  being there\u201D. I believe to make the experience being complete you have to live\
  \ that place, live the local\u2019s routine, to attend not just the touristic spots,\
  \ but also the little-known ones, those that are extremely valuable for who dwell\
  \ that space. I say that because two years ago I had the prove that this is the\
  \ best system used to be able to know a new city for sure.\nMy first exchange happened\
  \ in Florence, Italy, where I lived for five months while was studying Interior\
  \ Design in a really special school famous by there. \nGet inserted on a new culture\
  \ can be a really toilsome process or incredible easy, it\u2019s up to you and your\
  \ goals. I though travel and visit new places was just a hobby in my life, however\
  \ the reality changed completely when I saw myself making plans during the days\
  \ in order to feel like \u201CI make part of this society\u201D, seeking became\
  \ as citizen of that city as anyone who was born there.\nMy first attitude to make\
  \ me feel being part of that new space was meet the language. I always had curiosity\
  \ and facility to learn new languages (already can speak English and a little of\
  \ Spanish) and my relation with the Italian speech was pretty special, a very pleasure\
  \ process, I really loved could spoke this language that I particularly think it\u2019\
  s beautiful. For being a Latin language, a lot of words and the orthography are\
  \ similar to my birth language (Portuguese), therefore the learning process happened\
  \ so fast and in a couple of months I was could easily speak in popular spots in\
  \ the city, like stores, coffee shops, supermarkets, etc.\nTalking about popular\
  \ and regular activities inside the cities, this was the second thing I invested\
  \ to advance in the process of include myself in a new culture. Making shopping\
  \ in locals\u2019 supermarkets, to attend bakeries and \u201Ctake a coffee\u201D\
  \ before start the day activities were habits that made me feel part of that society\
  \ operation. \nThe habits power is incredible big, his repetition in different groups\
  \ get people closer and create new relationships. In my case, for example, the habit\
  \ I established of went every day to the coffee shop take my \u201CLatte\u201D,\
  \ surrendered to me a new friendship with an Italian girl who also attended the\
  \ same place and gave me too a closer relationship with the workers on that shop.\
  \ \nHowever, after I crossed the obstacles of insertion into a new culture, just\
  \ happened one of the bests experiences a trip can offer to you: the relationship\
  \ with new people from other countries, that also are there in the same situation\
  \ as you. Each one of those people have their particularities and their own cultures\
  \ and you be able to absorb a little bit of each one of those it\u2019s incredibly\
  \ special. \nTherefore, the advice I give after all this experience I lived in Italy,\
  \ far from home, family and my reality is: leave your comfort zone. Travel to a\
  \ new place and meet a new culture is always a great surprise and a personal and\
  \ cultural growth. You discover yourself as a new person, with new goals, new ambitions,\
  \ and tastes. \nI always feel extremely happy and excited to know I\u2019m about\
  \ to find new people, new constructions, foods, habits and mores. The time we take\
  \ to make a trip shouldn\u2019t be seen just at a pause and \u201Ctime to do nothing\u201D\
  , and yes as an opportunity to meet history. One of the bigger sources of knowledge\
  \ are people and the histories they have to tell, acting like the best mechanism\
  \ to extend and contribute for our experience\u2019s bag keep growing, just as the\
  \ surprises we have in every different place we know."
