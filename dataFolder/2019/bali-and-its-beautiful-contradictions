Text: "At the beginning I felt a bit lost seeing contradictions wherever I went. Bali\
  \ is fast, but at the same time slow and relaxed; it seems to be messed, but everything\
  \ works well; there are temples everywhere that look luxurious but the people do\
  \ not have much money; like this and so on\u2026\nThe first thing were the prices.\
  \ One simply needs to trust or ask more than twice to know the real ones. \nI was\
  \ coming from Nusa Penida to Ubud in a tropical rainy day. Just beginning to get\
  \ use to everything when at the exit of the ferry, maybe about eight people started\
  \ offering me transport. I didn\u2019t even noticed when I was sat in a car. Suddenly,\
  \ two German girls from outside invited me to join them in their cheaper car. I\
  \ left the car and the driver got very angry, telling me that I was a liar. I told\
  \ him that he was charging me four times than the real price when he pushed me to\
  \ the floor with my backpack on. He seemed out of control and his eyes were super\
  \ red. \nIn few seconds I \u201Ctrip\u201D to my higher self and I thought that\
  \ Bali would become an interesting travel experience...\nQuickly I got back to my\
  \ human self with the feeling of vulnerability and frustration.\nThe two following\
  \ days I just spent the time walking around. My attitude was like if all the ubudians\
  \ were guilty for what happened with that driver. Just I decided to say a resounding\
  \ \u2018NO!\u2019 to anyone who offered me something on the street, it didn\u2019\
  t matter if it was taxis, restaurants, massages, tours, etc... I guess just I wanted\
  \ to be in my own world and protect myself from who knows what or maybe from the\
  \ possible eschar that resonated within...\nBut something magic happened. A sensation\
  \ of freedom and self confidence that I didn\u2019t felt before. I realised that\
  \ I was learning to say \u201CNo\u201D. I used to keep inside most of the feelings\
  \ and thoughts. Even having a strong personality, this side of the \u201CNo\u201D\
  \ wasn\u2019t very developed.\nI appreciated that opening eye situation. First check,\
  \ this time Bali was an ego killer.\nAfter that, everyday was less hard to get involved\
  \ in the contradictions so I decided to move again. A friendly local drove me to\
  \ Canggu by scooter. What a freedom of travelling one hour in the middle of little\
  \ villages surrounded by rice fields, all green for one side and grey temples for\
  \ the other full of yellow flowers. The families were getting ready for a ceremony,\
  \ wearing their long \u201Csarong\u201D and perfectly tidy hair and soft makeup\
  \ on the women\u2019s faces. The wind brought to me the smell of incense that made\
  \ me feel a deep respect for their tradition. Second check, this time Bali showed\
  \ me that faith has different colors and purposes.\nI arrived in Canggu at an eco\
  \ house. It was a detoxification since the very first second when I put my feet\
  \ there. To swim in the gentle pool in the middle of the night with the stars falling\
  \ on my face, to fly in the yoga hammocks at the sunrise and eat the healthiest\
  \ food of my trip, were the magical instants that remind me the pleasure of being\
  \ part of the earth. Exactly that was my third check, Bali made me feel grounded\
  \ again as if I were back home.\nCouple of days later, I went to the Gili Islands.\
  \ Since I arrived I felt in love even though the next contradiction was in front\
  \ of my eyes. This time I just observed it. The hard work done by the people on\
  \ the boats, carrying our bags one by one. \nBig smile and naked feet quickly I\
  \ rode a bicycle and toured the Gili in 360 degrees. At the last tip of the island\
  \ I made friends. Two locals and a Californian scientist with whom I played dominoes\
  \ all afternoon. The last check? Bali gifted me an observational scenario, flowing\
  \ to the rhythm of the beauty of the different. I left promising to back always\
  \ to the simplicity of myself.\n\n\nNamast\xE9"
