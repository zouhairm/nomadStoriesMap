Text: "Life has moments where you draw an epiphany of actual realization. My epiphany\
  \ came from one sunset while staring off into the calm waterfront off the edge of\
  \ Nyhavn, Copenhagen. From the three continents, fifteen countries, and countless\
  \ cities I\u2019ve travelled, this little spot in Denmark had an overwhelming wave\
  \ of fresh air I never breathed before. My life will always go side by side with\
  \ travelling. I decided to start my journey with finding new and exciting ways to\
  \ make my travels more meaningful and captivating. \n\nHow can travelling become\
  \ more meaningful and captivating? It\u2019s not a matter of perfected itineraries\
  \ or continuous spontaneous decisions, but a combination of choices. I have travelled\
  \ with both mindsets of having a set and strict itinerary and also spontaneous destinations\
  \ but never both at the same time. \n\nThis is a habit I found was very difficult\
  \ to break. Paris, Edinburgh, Tokyo or New York, all major cities that raised perfect\
  \ opportunities to break out of my habit and this was one of the most difficult\
  \ tasks I was facing. It wasn\u2019t until Copenhagen and Croatia that I broke out\
  \ of this spell. I found myself visiting piers that wasn\u2019t scheduled in my\
  \ itinerary or sailing from Croatian island to island. One day I rented a scooter\
  \ on a whim to ride towards the top of the hill to overlook the Adriatic Sea. I\
  \ was in complete and utter bliss. \n\nHow could I miss such a beautiful opportunity\
  \ my entire life? That\u2019s the key to having happy habits, it doesn\u2019t hit\
  \ you until it finally does. When you have that life changing moment to finally\
  \ connect your true desires and happiness with an intangible feeling that can only\
  \ be experienced. It alters all of your perceptions you always held and your view\
  \ on life itself resets back to square one. \n\nSince that moment I have never looked\
  \ back. \n\nInterests and passion play a huge part of life because the interests\
  \ may not always reflect back on passionate cravings. A typical Toronto girl found\
  \ herself connecting her interests of meticulous planning with her love for travelling\
  \ and adventuring outside her she would never have dared to before. \n\nWould you\
  \ believe I came to this realization in that one moment I visited Copenhagen in\
  \ that one day? Seems farfetched but that\u2019s the thing about feelings, it can\
  \ only be true to the person feeling it. All it took was one day in the twenty-three\
  \ years of life I have experienced. One day to change my mindset and start living\
  \ a life that was meant for me. \n\nHaving happy habits start with listening to\
  \ that soft voice calling out from deep within your heart and soul. It cannot be\
  \ planned, scheduled, or loured out by any means. One day it will immerse itself\
  \ from the place that kept it hidden for so many years. One day you will hear the\
  \ voice that has always been calling out to you for so many moons. One day you will\
  \ break the bubble that kept your inner voice sheltered and stare out into the distance\
  \ to finally realize that there is something out there desperately calling for your\
  \ name. \n\nIt all starts with having happy habits and on that day, I heard, \u201C\
  Robin Ha, this is your bliss\u201D. Combining my habits have brought me true happiness\
  \ that cannot be replicated. Knowing what I know now, my travel plans have grown\
  \ into plans that can be altered at any time. My bucket list includes many beautiful\
  \ countries such as Thailand, Australia, or Portugal. Along the way if I find myself\
  \ taking the next flight out to Myanmar, New Zealand or Spain, then so be it. \n\
  \nThis is a simple concept I find complete and utter bliss in and for some it may\
  \ seem so easy but sometimes these simple thoughts are repressed due to the idea\
  \ that it is so easily attainable. I find it is the simple things that gets pushed\
  \ aside and rarely visited. My happy habits dive straight into the simplicity of\
  \ things and thus nourishes a stronger feeling of content within. \n\nMy name is\
  \ Robin Ha and this is my take on having happy ha-bits."
