Text: "Sitting on a cold winter evening, sipping my chocolate banana smoothie with\
  \ my friends in a small shop on the streets of Banaras made me feel content about\
  \ life. Originally known as \u2018Blue Lassi\u2019, the shop was famous because\
  \ of the traditional style of preparation and unique flavors. The narrow street,\
  \ which only had the capacity of one person to walk at a time was not only a source\
  \ of income for various foot vendors but also a home to the cows and the dogs moving\
  \ around. I couldn\u2019t muster what my friend was trying to say to me over all\
  \ the noise created by the locals around, but then within a few seconds everyone\
  \ went silent and only the chant could be heard.\n\n\u201CRam naam satya hai, Ram\
  \ naam satya hai, ram naam\u2026\u2026 \u201C\n\nEveryone made place for the people\
  \ chanting. They were carrying a dead body to the cremation ghats (a series of steps\
  \ going towards the river), Manikarnika. This was the first time ever I had seen\
  \ a dead body. But the silence only lasted a couple of seconds. The moment after\
  \ the body passed us, everyone went back to their routine. \n\u201CHow many dead\
  \ bodies do they take to the ghat in a day?\u201D I asked the owner of the shop.\
  \ 40, he said. He told me how the Manikarnika ghat was a sacred place, it has been\
  \ dedicated to cremating bodies since centuries. The ghat had a deep history to\
  \ it. It is believed that while bathing in the river, Lord Shiva, one of the Hindu\
  \ Gods, lost his ear ornament in the river. The name \u2018Manikarnika\u2019 is\
  \ a combination of three words \u2018Mani\u2019 (meaning \u2013 bead), \u2018Karnam\u2019\
  \ (meaning \u2013 ear) and \u2018Angad\u2019 (meaning \u2013 ornament). People believed\
  \ that if someone is cremated at the ghat, they will get salvation. \nWe decided\
  \ to visit the Manikarnika ghat. The big gateway and the temple on the right marked\
  \ the entrance of the steps going towards the river. We could witness four bodies\
  \ being cremated side by side. I could spot the four men who took the last body\
  \ of the day to the ghat, they were bathing in the Ganga river as a traditional\
  \ practice of bathing after burning the dead. We were asked to leave immediately\
  \ as according to the Hindu mythology, presence of a female on the cremation ground\
  \ is considered unholy.\nWe decided to go back, we continued walking on the Ghats.\
  \ Kashi had about 500 ghats marking the edge of the city. All of these ghats were\
  \ connected, one could walk from one side to the other side without leaving the\
  \ river. We reached another one of the holy ghats named Dashashwamedh, meaning ten\
  \ horses. We could see people getting ready for the big ceremonial prayer of the\
  \ river Ganga. There were about 500 people from the city and the tourist standing\
  \ ready for the ceremony, ready with all the things that they wanted to wish during\
  \ the prayer, success, divinity, wealth and peace.\nI glanced at the woman besides\
  \ me, she was a mother of two boys. The smaller one had one hand in his mouth and\
  \ the other tightly clutched by his mother in the fear of losing him in the crowd.\
  \ She prayed with her sons, swirled some flowers above their head and immersed the\
  \ petals into the river, probably hoping for a better future.\nAnd I wondered then,\
  \ that how people served the river with petals of jasmin and ashes of the dead at\
  \ the same time. How they pray for a successful future and of salvation to the same\
  \ waters.\nI looked at the brightly lit Ganga. I closed my eyes and prayed for the\
  \ river, prayed for its survival from the burnt ashes and excessive greedy wishes."
