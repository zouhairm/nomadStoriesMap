Text: "I love making new friends but it\u2019s my first time in a tiny town in Russia,\
  \ so here things are quite different. I\xB4m done with work; I\xB4m heading back\
  \ home, as usual, but this evening I\xB4m about to have one of the most memorable\
  \ experiences in my life. \nWalking in the snow helps me to keep fit, and I also\
  \ enjoy it when the wind slaps my face while I trudge through the snow. I\u2019\
  ve never lived in such a place surrounded by tons of crunchy and slippery snow but\
  \ I got used to it, so now I adore the sound of my boots on the ground made by each\
  \ step. \nAt the beginning it was amazing. Everything on the street became white\
  \ and I felt like I was living in Narnia. Nonetheless, after three months my admiration\
  \ for the snow-covered city wore off and my walk to and from work became tedious.\
  \ \nWhat can I cook for the dinner? Oh sure, potatoes is the best choice here. Yes,\
  \ Russia has the best potatoes so far. However, there are not many fresh veggies\
  \ to make a good salad; nor good olive oil for a dressing. \nIt\xB4s already been\
  \ six months since I came to Neftekamsk, the place of the Kama River in the heart\
  \ of the Bashkortostan Republic in Russia. Baked potatoes with cheese on top and\
  \ -fresh chopped cucumber, cherry tomatoe and sliced yellow pepper-salad with a\
  \ side of brown bread and dinner is ready.\nI appreciate a good meal in a tranquil\
  \ and charming environment. However, today is different; someone is knocking on\
  \ my door while I\u2019m eating. \nI didn\xB4t pay any attention to it, but that\
  \ someone insisted, so I decided to open the door, and there she was: a furious\
  \ real Russian lady who started shouting at me as if I were her deadliest enemy.\
  \ \nI\xB4m learning Russian but of course I\u2019m not good enough to keep an argument\
  \ in Russian, but I tried my best and I apologized without reason in order to make\
  \ her calm down. \nHowever, it didn\xB4t help. She kept yelling and I kept apologizing.\
  \ I\u2019ve never said sorry so many times in my life, not even when I lived in\
  \ Canada. But, finally, she got exhausted and she left. \nSuddenly, I began to laugh\
  \ insanely.  I experienced that kind of laugh that at the end makes you explode\
  \ in a couple of tears down your cheeks. That was hilarious and I had to tell somebody\
  \ about it. \nI phoned my workmate, Anastasia who said: \u201COh, she only wants\
  \ to be your friend\u201D. You must be kidding, Nat, I replied. No, no, she said:\
  \ some people here have different ways to approach foreigners. Now, it\u2019s your\
  \ turn to visit her, but first you need to bake an apple pie or some other dessert,\
  \ then you should find the right time to knock on her door. \nI\u2019ve lived in\
  \ other countries, and I\u2019ve never come across such an unusual way to make friends.\
  \ Nonetheless, it\u2019s my first time in Russia so I think this is the way here,\
  \ perhaps not in the whole country, but in Neftekamsk it might be right.\nI enjoy\
  \ cooking, and when I do it for somebody else, it\u2019s much better. I wanted to\
  \ make a cheese cake for her, so spent the whole afternoon making a blueberry cheese\
  \ cake and finally I got ready to go see her.\nIn Russia, most people live in flats\
  \ and I didn\u2019t know which one my neighbour lived in, so the only way to find\
  \ it out was knocking all the doors in my building. After four attempts, I found\
  \ her. She saw me and she ran to me with the most sincere smile I\xB4ve ever seen\
  \ in my entire life. \nAnastasia was right: she just wanted to be my friend. Her\
  \ name is Lubov and since that day I have a new friend and also a Russian teacher,\
  \ yes. Every Sunday we meet up for a cup of tea while she teaches me Russian. Her\
  \ goal: to have a chat with me without using Yandex translator, my goal: to learn\
  \ as much as I can from her,  including her language."
