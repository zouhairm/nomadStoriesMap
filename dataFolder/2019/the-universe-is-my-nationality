Text: "The summer of 2018, when I decided to go on my first trip with my friends.\n\
  Marmaris was our destination, I loved every single detail about it, maybe it\u2019\
  s not Marmaris that was so special, but my excitement and eager to see and feel\
  \ more.\nThe moment our plane landed, my usual busy life was on hold, and a new\
  \ me was born. It was so hot, but so beautiful, I decided to live every moment and\
  \ keep it inside of me.\nThe moment we arrived, we met a group of Turkish students,\
  \ we came together to have dinner. After enjoying a Shawarma loaded with chicken\
  \ and Vegetables, our new friends started to play some music, and everybody started\
  \ singing on Turkish songs. The most impressive part of the whole night, however,\
  \ was something different. Have you ever seen 1 Billion stars? This is how we felt\
  \ whilst watching the clear sky while relaxing on the beach. I have never seen so\
  \ many stars.\nHave you ever tasted the air? Have you ever enjoyed the scent of\
  \ clear sea water? I did in Marmaris, I gazed at everything my sight caught and\
  \ saved some captions of the sea laying beneath the mountains. \nI never thought\
  \ that humans could ever have super natural powers, but I was wrong, me and my friends\
  \ had powers back then, we overcame our common fear of heights, and went parasailing\
  \ on our first day, \u201Cand when I say super natural powers, I mean it for people\
  \ who were terrified to look down when sitting on a 2nd floor balcony, but they\
  \ were excited to be towed behind a boat and parasailed 400 feet in the air\u201D\
  . We soared high above the clouds, staring at the water beneath. I looked down,\
  \ terrified. My friends followed my eyes and became scared as well.  But then they\
  \ told me to look at the horizon, the colors, the ships, and the birds. It was at\
  \ this point that I stopped praying and started looking! It was breathtaking! I\
  \ was a bird, looking at the beautiful world below me. The water was blue, pink\
  \ and green, taking its hues from the sky, plants and sunlight. \nI remember before\
  \ Marmaris, I was a different person, I usually never have coffee without milk,\
  \ I hate to be touched by cats, and I hate really hate not having enough sleep.\
  \ But all that changed! As is I were a different person! An upgraded version of\
  \ myself, and the most important thing is loving this new self of mine.\nI lived\
  \ the following moments of my trip by being a part of the place, and that is when\
  \ I decided that borders and human-draw lines between countries are not real, they\
  \ were never real. This whole universe is ours, to love it and live it and cherish\
  \ it, as long as human kind will exist."
