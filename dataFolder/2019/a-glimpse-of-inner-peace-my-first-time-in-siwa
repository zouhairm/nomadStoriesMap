Text: "You expect experiencing new cultures when travelling, but you never expect\
  \ as much when you travel within your own country. I\u2019d heard many tales of\
  \ Siwa Oasis and its serene beauty, but I'd never gone there. What got me even more\
  \ curious was the fact that you wouldn\u2019t hear the name Siwa mentioned without\
  \ their Festival of Reconciliation. I did a little digging and found out that the\
  \ celebration was 160 years old \u2013 but it didn\u2019t start out with festivities\
  \ and peace; it started out with a war.\n\nFor years the eastern and western dwellers\
  \ of the oasis were at war, until a Sufi Sheikh decided to end the dispute by gathering\
  \ the elders of all tribes and having them eat together. After that, they could\
  \ fight no more. Since then, whenever the moon is at its brightest every October,\
  \ the people of Siwa gather at Dakrour Mountain to celebrate peace and harvest for\
  \ three consecutive days.\n\nWhen I got the chance to visit Siwa in the time of\
  \ the festival, what really stood out to me immediately was how much the place and\
  \ the people weren\u2019t phony or contrived. There was a genuine warmth and coziness\
  \ to the place, so much that it felt like home to a first time visitor like myself!\n\
  \nWitnessing the preparations at the mountain side, you won\u2019t find a fancy\
  \ red carpet leading to some sophisticated quarters; you\u2019ll find people sitting\
  \ on the floor, preparing food while chanting and praising God. In the midst of\
  \ it all, you\u2019ll find a hero making tea for the bustling crowd in the Siwan\
  \ way. Everyone\u2019s smiling and content; no one\u2019s pissed off because they\u2019\
  re cooking with roaring fires under the heat of the sun, or because they\u2019re\
  \ up at dawn preparing.\n\nAround noon of the first day of the festival, a person\
  \ calls unto people to assemble. In a few minutes, the people of Siwa gather in\
  \ front of the mountain in small circles, elderly and younglings alike, and eat\
  \ together amidst a tranquil, simple ambiance.\n\nStill, the festival is not just\
  \ about the people gathering to eat and celebrate peace; on this occasion, any dispute\
  \ between Siwans is resolved. Every year, the elders of Siwan tribes gather to settle\
  \ any conflict in the city, whether the conflicting parties like it or not.\n\n\
  That touched me the most. Not many would disagree that we live in a conflict-riddled\
  \ world, be it for ideological, religious, or whatever reasons people find to hate\
  \ one another. So, to find people amidst it all going through great lengths to keep\
  \ the peace and spread love and tolerance was something I didn\u2019t expect in\
  \ a million years, and it was overwhelming.\n\nNighttime is different during the\
  \ feast; after Night Prayer, the people gather at the mountain in a Sufi gathering,\
  \ which gradually grows in size to include all those present from the people of\
  \ Siwa, everyone chanting and praising god. I can\u2019t lay claim to being a spiritual\
  \ person, but regardless of your beliefs, I reckon you\u2019d be unable to help\
  \ feeling some spirituality, under the moonlight by the mountainside, while witnessing\
  \ the people of Siwa in a large circle holding hands and chanting as one.\n\nPeace\
  \ of mind is one of those things you hear about in movies or read about in books;\
  \ the protagonist is always searching for it; driven by it. Personally, I\u2019\
  ve long searched for it \u2013 I still am, and probably always will. In Siwa, I\
  \ saw what peace of mind looks like on the faces of the people; I saw simplicity,\
  \ satisfaction, and contentment with much and little alike. I honestly don\u2019\
  t know what peace of mind really is, or if I'd be able to find it; what I do know\
  \ is that I caught a glimpse of it in Siwa, and what I\u2019m certain of is that\
  \ Siwa is one of two places in my life where I slept without being overwhelmed by\
  \ dark thoughts or the past and future keeping me turning all night. If peace of\
  \ mind means sleeping with a clear mind and a heart at ease, then that is a favor\
  \ I\u2019ll owe Siwa eternally \u2013 even if our paths don\u2019t cross again."
