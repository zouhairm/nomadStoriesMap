Text: "Morocco is a country I\u2019ve been consistently cautioned about by female\
  \ travellers, so much so that even after seven years of solo travelling through\
  \ the other inhabitable continents and over forty countries, I was still wary of\
  \ travelling there. A few months ago, I had two weeks in Europe I intended to use\
  \ to explore somewhere new. Googling did little to abate my fears: I found blogs\
  \ detailing the country\u2019s sights and splendour, yet several solo female travellers\
  \ wrote of relentless harassment which cut their trips short. I\u2019ve been harassed\
  \ in many of the places I\u2019ve been to, and over the years I\u2019ve developed\
  \ the ability to promptly yet politely shake off most strangers who\u2019ve unnerved\
  \ me. \n\nDespite this, the thought of going to Morocco genuinely stressed me out,\
  \ which I hadn\u2019t experienced since my first solo trip aged 17 years old, where\
  \ I\u2019d developed a nervous eye twitch that lasted for two weeks. Yet the Skyscanner\
  \ search had pulled up an alluringly cheap flight, and months spent in the distressing\
  \ icebox known as Canadian winter had me desperately craving sun and t-shirt weather.\
  \ Morocco was the only warm place within my budget, otherwise I was doomed to sub-freezing\
  \ temperatures in the Baltics or Scandinavia. \n\nI needed another opinion from\
  \ the source itself: a girl I\u2019d met months earlier in New Orleans was studying\
  \ abroad in Morocco for a year, and we\u2019d fortuitously followed each other on\
  \ Instagram. I sent off the first message asking how she was finding Morocco. A\
  \ rapid-fire of reassuring messages came forth, and I booked the flight that night,\
  \ comforting myself with the fact that I could just miss the flight if I felt too\
  \ stressed. Truthfully, the fact that I\u2019d be meeting up with this fleeting\
  \ friend the day after my arrival was the trigger, which hadn\u2019t ever been a\
  \ factor in my travels before. I distinctly recall thinking that I could also fly\
  \ immediately out of the country if necessary. \n\nI didn\u2019t flee Morocco \u2013\
  \ I stretched out my stay and cancelled plans to visit Gibraltar and London in favour\
  \ of staying in a country I didn\u2019t think I would be able to enjoy. Some snapshots:\
  \ the winding medina in Fes resistant to Google Maps I somehow managed to navigate,\
  \ sunrises on riad rooftops, pampered street cats at every turn, feasting on tagines,\
  \ intricate mosaics fit for royalty, the thousand shades of blue painting Chefchaouen,\
  \ the pungent yet mesmerising Fes tannery, the Grecian feel of a small coastal town\
  \ called Asilah, horses on the beach, sunset at the ruined fortress \u2018Tombe\
  \ dei Merenidi\u2019 in Fes, stumbling onto a restaurant in Tangier visited by Anthony\
  \ Bourdian \u2013 \u2018Restaurant Saveur de Poisson\u2019 \u2013 both sans price\
  \ and a menu and reaching peak gastronomic bliss, swinging on a hammock looking\
  \ out at Spain to the left, camel burgers at \u2018The Clock Caf\xE9\u2019, vivid\
  \ carpets and fabrics temptingly laid out at every turn, ostriches posing for selfies,\
  \ people watching from cafes whilst sipping mint tea, bumper cars at a fairground,\
  \ carts heaped with raspberries and avocados \u2013 just to name a few.  \n\nAll\
  \ the Moroccans I met were kind and welcoming, and my fears of harassment were unrealised.\
  \ There was the occasional whistle, greeting, offer for directions, but there was\
  \ no relentless tide, as I\u2019d imagined. A factor is that I befriended people\
  \ in hostels, movie cinemas and cafes: in the four cities I visited over ten days,\
  \ I was often with people exploring, Moroccans and tourists alike. I never expected\
  \ to love Morocco, and now, it\u2019s somewhere I can\u2019t wait to return to.\
  \ \n\nThere are more streets to explore, and even if that\u2019s done, sitting on\
  \ rooftops furnished with plush cushions in every Moroccan city will never cease\
  \ to be an enthralling activity. I went to Morocco expecting the worst, and instead\
  \ found a place that has became familiar enough to feel like home. The writer William\
  \ Burroughs spent years in Tangier, writing: \u201Ca paranoid is someone who knows\
  \ a little of what\u2019s going on\u201D \u2013 it seems like those other bloggers\
  \ only scratched at Morocco\u2019s surface, and perhaps I\u2019m \u201Ca rational\u201D\
  \ \u2013 I\u2019m someone who realises that the North African country has a whole\
  \ lot of good going on."
