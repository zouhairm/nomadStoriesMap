Text: "It had been a long morning. I'd woken up in Paris, sunlight soft on my face\
  \ with a view of the Sacre Coeur through the window. It had been quite the adventure,\
  \ catching a train alone from Gare Montparnasse to Rennes with beginner's French.\
  \ However, I can read the language far better than I can speak it, so thankfully,\
  \ I didn't end up in the wrong place. \nI'd never been to Paris before this trip,\
  \ and I'd always longed to visit. My father, however, was not as enthusiastic about\
  \ visiting the city of romance on our French family road-trip, so, it was decided\
  \ that I'd visit the capital then catch a train to join the family in Brittany.\
  \ I wasn't let down by Paris, although there was a slight incident on the Seine\
  \ which proved, I did still suffer from sea-sickness. \nI gazed out of the window\
  \ of the TGV train as the Parisian suburbs flashed by. It was onwards to Aurey,\
  \ Brittany with a stop in Rennes to meet my Mum and Dad, who had set off a week\
  \ earlier and driven through Normandy. I've often said living in my little family\
  \ is like living in a comedy sketch, and I couldn't wait to hear their attempts\
  \ at speaking the local language. Dad had assured me he did not sound like Del-Boy,\
  \ but I wasn't convinced. \nThe train journey went quickly and without fuss, the\
  \ carriages considerably fancier than the rickety Northern rail efforts I'd become\
  \ accustomed to at home in the North of England. As we pulled into Rennes, I grabbed\
  \ my bag and stepped out onto the platform. There's always a strange excitement\
  \ and intrigue about being in a foreign country, especially when you can't quite\
  \ understand what all the signs mean. Despite a slight language barrier, I spotted\
  \ my Mum waving by the stairs and she wrapped her arms around me in a soft embrace.\n\
  \"How was Paris? We missed you!\" She greeted me.\n\"Exactly how I imagined!\" I\
  \ replied, \"Where's Dad?\"\nApparently, they'd had quite the experience locating\
  \ the station carpark, the details of which I was filled in on whilst we walked\
  \ through the length of the station and to the car. I was listening, but I was also\
  \ quite distracted with the ham and cheese baguette I'd been given by my Mum. The\
  \ French do know how to do baked goods. \nTwo hours later, and we arrived at our\
  \ apartment where we'd be staying for three nights until we ventured onto \xEEle\
  \ d'Ol\xE9ron, a small island off the West coast. I'd also been told, a couple of\
  \ days ago, that my Dad had mixed up the island and accidentally booked a hotel\
  \ on the wrong island, but what was a family trip without the excitement of not\
  \ quite being sure of whereabouts you're staying. \nWe should have noticed something\
  \ was off when we first walked into the lobby of our apartment block, but we were\
  \ sidetracked by my Dad's folder of meticulously organized booking confirmations\
  \ and a minor confusion of whether we wanted breakfast in our room or in the communal\
  \ area. It was solved after asking them to please parler plus lentement (speak a\
  \ little slower), so we took our bags upstairs and unlocked our home for the next\
  \ few days. \nIt was a lovely apartment...almost too lovely. Modern and spacious,\
  \ and even a weekly chalkboard in the kitchen. \n\"Do they think we need help remembering\
  \ what day it is?\" My Dad joked. My Mother was not amused.\n\"Something's not right\
  \ about this place, Dave.\" She said, her face masked by a scowl. \n\"Don't be silly.\"\
  \ He told her. \"It's lovely!\"\nAs I walked into the kitchen, I spotted an odd\
  \ magazine on the side: the French equivalent of 50 plus. Then I realized what had\
  \ been strange about everyone we'd walked past on our way up to our room. They were\
  \ all quite elderly. \n\"Dad,\" I whispered, \"Mum's right.\" I picked up the magazine\
  \ and slid it across the table. Something had been lost in translation on Booking.com.\
  \ When we realized, my father and I burst out in laughter. \nWe'd accidentally booked\
  \ ourselves a room in an old people's home!"
