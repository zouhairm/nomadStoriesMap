Text: "My camera was perched on my nose. I peered through the viewfinder. I had my\
  \ shot. This worn and tiny, yet colourful wooden house was perfectly set in my frame.\
  \ As my finger was set to push the shoot button, suddenly a curious old man flung\
  \ the rickety, front, wooden screen door open. I hesitated. He had what seemed to\
  \ be a serious and almost agitated scowl draped on his face. I was embarrassed and\
  \ couldn\u2019t take the shot, but my finger remained firmly perched on the button.\
  \ I yelled out from the other side of the street:  \u201CGood afternoon sir, could\
  \ I take a picture?\u201D\u2026 \n\nIt was a Friday and after a five hours drive\
  \ from Mexico City I was finally in my desired destination: the Port of Veracruz.\
  \ The gulf coast city famous for being Mexico\u2019s busiest port and the site where\
  \ the Spanish conquerors first set foot on Mesoamerica, has always tugged on my\
  \ curiosity strings. \n\nI admit the city is kind of neglected, dinghy, and half\
  \ eaten by the humid, warm and salty sea air. All that is metal is rusty. However,\
  \ it is charming, humble and doused in a good dose of joyful vibes. People go out\
  \ in their finest dress to dance danzon  or latin tropical music in the public plazas.\
  \ It isn\u2019t a show organized for tourists, it\u2019s just Veracruzanos enjoying\
  \ themselves in an every weekend activity. \n\nYet the scowling old man planted\
  \ in his doorway was not anywhere near the charming sights. I found him in a semi\
  \ desolate, working class neighbourhood called La Huaca. Huaca comes from the word\
  \ \u201Chuacal\u201D which means wooden crate. The neighbourhood is made up of wooden\
  \ shacks, once the improvised homes of Veracruz\u2019s fishermen. \n\nThe old man\
  \ responded to my request: \u201CGo ahead!\u201D and he tucked himself inside his\
  \ house, leaving the rickety screen door half open.\n\u201CNo! I want you to be\
  \ in the shot,\u201D I yelled out. \n\nBewildered, the old man peered out the door\
  \ again. His scowl was fortuitously tarnished by a solid grin. I took the picture.\n\
  \n\u201CWhy do you want a picture of me?\u201D he asked. \n\n\u201CBecause of the\
  \ grin.\u201D I replied.\nIn a formal tone he introduced himself as \u201CMadera\u201D\
  \ which means wood. Now I was perplexed.\n\n\u201CMadera?\u201D I asked, hoping\
  \ that he was in fact being formal and not trying to mix in some double entendre.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYep! That is my nickname, everyone calls me madera. I actually don\u2019\
  t think anyone around here knows me by my real name. Heck, I sometimes forget my\
  \ real name!\u201D\n\nMadera says he acquired his nickname from his father, also\
  \ known as Madera, who was a railway worker who often travelled in freight cars\
  \ filled with wood. Madera says his son is also  known as Madera, that\u2019s the\
  \ way it is in La Huaca.\n\nProud to be the character of my photographs, Madera\
  \ invites me to stroll through La Huaca with him. He gives me an 8-block tour, filled\
  \ with possibly factually inaccurate historical anecdotes. He streams through a\
  \ list of bygone Mexican celebrities that supposedly found their roots in the neighbourhood.\
  \ Whether his claims are fact or fiction is irrelevant to me, his excited grin and\
  \ eagerness to tell a good story is enough.\n\nAfter several hours had passed and\
  \ all 8 blocks of La Huaca covered, Madera shamefully tells me he needs to go to\
  \ an important appointment. It was getting dark and I too had plans. I wanted to\
  \ catch some evening salsa and cumbia scheduled in one of the public plazas by the\
  \ harbour. We share our goodbyes and I march off. \n\nTwo hours later I was  at\
  \ the Plaza \u201CLa Campana\u201D, ready to start dancing some salsa,  what was\
  \ my surprise that all of a sudden in the middle of the crowd was the familiar grin\
  \ of Madera. He made it to his important appointment. As he twirled to the music\u2019\
  s rhythm I thought to myself what a way to live out the twilight years."
