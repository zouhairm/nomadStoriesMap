Text: "A musty clay-like smell followed thick clouds of fine ochre dust as we pulled\
  \ up to the battered fenceline of Ltyentye Apurte. 80 kilometres of jagged, unsealed\
  \ roads left our jaws jittering, but the rich red landscape flecked with towering\
  \ gum trees made the trip worth every bump. \n\nMy high-school had planned this\
  \ two-week trip for months, researching the help that we could provide the Indigenous\
  \ camp that would prove useful and desired. The decision was a clean-up after a\
  \ horrific dust storm, as well as delivering art packs to the children who attended\
  \ the small school there. There were six of us who made the trip, plus two teachers.\
  \ There was almost a sense of liberation, as though we were on our way to help these\
  \ people out of a third-world lifestyle.\n\nSlowly guiding the late 90s Toyota Landcruiser\
  \ Troop Carrier through the narrow \u201Cstreets\u201D of this Indigenous camp,\
  \ we drew a lot of attention. Children stopped and stared, some followed on their\
  \ ramshackle bicycles, and a countless number of stray dogs followed, barked, some\
  \ nipped at the tyres. Our accommodation was not much more than a rectangle of bricks\
  \ with a corrugated iron roof, the windows were old glass louvres - open and immovable.\
  \ I felt queasy. The mountainous red landscapes were spectacular, but it was such\
  \ a strange juxtaposition against what looked like housing poverty.\n\nThe night\
  \ passed and the following morning we were invited by the Brothers of the camp to\
  \ attend the Church choir and a traditional Indigenous smoke cleansing ceremony.\
  \ Not quite sure what we were in for, we made our way to the Church \u2013 a small\
  \ hand-made \u201Ccave\u201D like room, it was painted brightly by locals and smelled\
  \ of earth. We sat, hot, cramped sweating, and smelly, and then experienced something\
  \ more magical than words can express. The women of the choir began to sing, and\
  \ I began to sob. Completely ethereal, the voices coming from these women were those\
  \ of empowerment, of love, of strength and toil and a wholesome passion for their\
  \ livelihoods, which still felt so otherworldly to me. The spherical room provided\
  \ an unparalleled acoustic backdrop for their angelic voices which danced over the\
  \ painted walls, as a Mother would frolic with children. Completely overcome with\
  \ these feelings of unconditional love, tears fell from my eyes as the angelic voices\
  \ danced their way into my head. \n\nLater, the smoke ceremony was another unfamiliar\
  \ experience. We quietly made our way inside a natural cave, the dense earthly perfume\
  \ slowed my heart-rate and I felt an instant sense of security surrounded by the\
  \ clay. We moved into a circle around an old tin barrel of leaves and the Elder\
  \ Mother began to set alight leaves of a glossy deep green. She began to push the\
  \ smouldering \u201Cbush medicine\u201D into our souls; smoke travelling up our\
  \ arms, into our chest, permeating our hair and our nostrils and our clothes. Overwhelmed,\
  \ the experience was as if Mother Nature was whispering to me herself, maternal,\
  \ nurturing, safe.\n\nAfter just this first day, my opinions were transformed. When\
  \ I stepped on to the soil of Ltyentye Apurte, I held my head high as a charity-worker,\
  \ someone who would provide some sort of relief from the lives that the Indigenous\
  \ must be living here; the run-down shop which was more of a shed with a barred\
  \ window, the one demountable building that they called a school, the dilapidated\
  \ bicycles that the children rode around, the dirty torn clothing that the individuals\
  \ wore \u2013 I believed it was borderline third-world.\n\nI did not expect to find\
  \ myself lost in their world so quickly, completely wound up in Mother Nature and\
  \ taken aback by the simplicity of the Indigenous\u2019 lifestyle. Leaving, I would\
  \ be envious."
