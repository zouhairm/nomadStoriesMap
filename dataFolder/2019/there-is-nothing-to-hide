Text: "\u201CBelieve it or not, but back then this is what we would have called Airbnbs.\u201D\
  \ It was impossible not to pay attention to the man in front of us. Pointing with\
  \ his green phosphorescent, wooden handled umbrella, at the numbers inscribed on\
  \ the head of the balconies and telling us about the bull fights in 1723. The rooster\
  \ on his cap contrastated with his severe beard, which was starting to whiten at\
  \ its extremities. We were in the center of Donostia \u2013 what the locals call\
  \ San Sebastian \u2013  at the end of February, on a Tuesday morning.\n\nBut Tuesday\
  \ morning is not actually the best time for a group of nine people, that certainly\
  \ may seem small for some, to lose themselves on the streets of Donostia. We understood\
  \ this since the first honk came up, until we arrived at the statue of a soldier,\
  \ beating his drums in front of a rock bord, on which were inscribed the lyrics\
  \ of \u201CMarcha del San Sebastian\u201D. The light was strong and the shadow of\
  \ the soldier was casting  the perfect shape of a pregnant (wo)man. At the feet\
  \ of the soldier, right in front of us, the remains of a McDonalds hamburger were\
  \ sitting quietly. \n\nAnd quietly was David too when he started to march right\
  \ in front of us, moving his legs and arms in perfect harmony. It was the start\
  \ of another story. The one about the french soldiers who occupied San Sebastian\
  \ during the nineteenth century and about the local women, carrying water in their\
  \ carafes, imitating and joking about the soldiers who were watching them nervously.\
  \ The one about the death and the Tamborrada, that time of year when everyone wears\
  \ uniforms, not costumes \u2013 as David emphasized three or four times, to be sure\
  \ that we understood his meaning \u2013 of the chefs and the soldiers and the women\
  \ with carafes. \u201CTo some, it might seem crazy that we wear soldier uniforms,\
  \ since they did to us what they did. But we celebrate life. We turn sadness into\
  \ happiness. As the song says, we are always happy. The Tamborrada is about continuing\
  \ to live.\u201D Continuing to live in a city that was burned and rebuilt. Burned\
  \ and rebuilt. \n\nThis is, maybe, why, no matter where you find yourself in the\
  \ body of the city, towards the ocean or next to the beach, towards the summit of\
  \ the hills or towards the buildings that are tickling your so-called aesthete's\
  \ eyes, or even towards Pesito de Pescadores  de Nuestra Se\xF1ora del Carmen, the\
  \ pulse is the same. The same creole child runs after a white, deflated ball among\
  \ the restaurants situated on a narrow street, where the tourists search for the\
  \ best pinchos. The same green shutters, slammed against the walls, the same windows\
  \ opened wide, with no curtains at all. The same laundry \u2013 trousers, skirts,\
  \ T-shirts, even underwear \u2013 hanging in the soft breeze of the ocean, right\
  \ next to the church. There is nothing to hide. An old lady listens to the news.\
  \ The sound of the TV crackles in the head of passersby. \n\nWe had arrived in Donostia\
  \ only one day before. Our trip had been quickly planned and had taken the shape\
  \ of a four-hour ride from Bordeaux, the city we were studying in for a semester.\
  \ We had arrived there and gone directly to the ocean, taking off our shoes and\
  \ letting our feet deepen in the sand, the way they always do it in the movies.\
  \ The water had been cold and bitten our skin, on which still remained the traces\
  \ of our socks. And now what? the boys had asked."
