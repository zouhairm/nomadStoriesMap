Text: "Having been introduced to traveling very early in life - I'd visited perhaps\
  \ all of Middle East and the Gulf with my parents. I'd never travelled without them\
  \ and a tour guide let alone explore by myself.\n\nIn late 2015 and early 2016,\
  \ I married the man I loved the most and we were planning our honeymoon (of course).\
  \ Indian weddings are a big , fat , expensive affair. We had run out of most of\
  \ our income but wanted to take our first holiday anyway. \n\nMy husband and I are\
  \ opposites. He's laid back while I love getting to plan things. I was barely 24\
  \ years old then.  I took it in my hands to have a customised, tailor-made amd in\
  \ budget honeymoon. (Mind you it was our first !)\n\nI booked tickets for Maldives\
  \ , which had a stop over at Sri Lanka. That way we explored 2 countries together.\
  \ We landed Sri Lanka on 7th February 2016 and explored four cities in four days.\
  \ Negombo, Colombo, Bentota , Kandy and Nuwara Eliya. We had our fun share of white\
  \ water river rafting, cliff diving, water sliding, kayaking etc. We visited the\
  \ temples , sat on elephants, looked around tea plantations and historical sites.\
  \ On 10th February we reached Maldives. Anyone who has visited the Maldives know\
  \ it's a cluster of islands - with one hotel on each island. (Even the airport is\
  \ on one island and so is the Capital Mal\xE9 on another). Traveling to and fro\
  \ is an expensive affair. So we stayed at Hulhulmale Island ( a connecting island\
  \ to the airport by a bridge) and went Island hopping from there. Whilst in Maldives,\
  \ we went Scuba Diving , fishing and snorkelling. I'd requested the hotelier for\
  \ an upgrade since we were on our honeymoon and hence even got the Suite to ourselves!\
  \ We visited a deserted island too and also explored Mal\xE9 city. Maldives is a\
  \ beautiful country - a must visit! Tranquil, crystal clear waters, white sandy\
  \ beaches, mesmerizing sunsets and sun downers - it is a must if you're a water\
  \ baby like me. Maldives is breathtakingly beautiful than most countries I have\
  \ visited even today. Words can hardly do its pristine waters any justice. It was\
  \ our first time - experiencing traveling alone, undertaking water sport activities,\
  \ our first trip, even our first fight! (Haha), the first time we stepped out of\
  \ our comfort zone and most importantly we had explored two countries in 7 days\
  \ for 1000 dollars (including both our flights, visas, stay, meals, sight seeing,\
  \ activities, excluding our shopping expenses) That's what (honestly) brought the\
  \ actual smile on our faces. \nAfter that trip we've made sure to explore at least\
  \ one country in a year and we do it in budget (and style) too! Since 2016 , we\
  \ have visited Dubai - again completely planned by us - we took the metro to most\
  \ places to make it an economical one! , Egypt - our first wonder of the world,\
  \ Israel & Jordan. \n\nWe realised one thing through traveling though - it only\
  \ made our bond stronger and helps us plan the next one's better. It was completely\
  \ a leap into the unknown for us - from the cuisine , to the sightseeing, the cultural\
  \ differences but we did it and we will continue doing it! \n\nWe obviously never\
  \ forget our firsts."
