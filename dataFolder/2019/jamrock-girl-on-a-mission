Text: "In August 2013, I came to the United States. This was my first time living\
  \ away from home. Before coming here, I did not realize how vastly different our\
  \ cultures were - Jamaica and the United States. My mission along the way, was to\
  \ understand enough about development to make contributions to development around\
  \ the world. It was with this vision in mind that I'd thrust myself into studies\
  \ in economics, public administration, and sustainable development. And in the future,\
  \ international relations. \nIn the US, I met people from almost every continent\
  \ and a variety of countries and cultures. I have realized and appreciated my own\
  \ growth as a result. Cultural exchanges really does open your mind's eye to so\
  \ many different perspectives. As a global citizen, what better way to develop these\
  \ exchanges and promote mutual understanding one person at a time, than to travel!\n\
  In my Facebook friends list where I previously only had Jamaicans and a few Americans,\
  \ I now have Mexicans, Nigerians, one Romanian, at least one Kyrgyz, Indians, Thais,\
  \ Indonesians, Saudi Arabians, Jordanians, Germans, and a host of other nationalities.\
  \ Usually, as a Jamaican, the idea of other cultures and languages excite me. But\
  \ prior to coming to the US, I was so sheltered that I did not know that Saudi Arabians\
  \ could come to the US due to constant administrative conflicts. I was pleasantly\
  \ surprised by this. \nTwo nights ago, I attended a cultural show on campus. There\
  \ were dances and performance from countries all over the world; even populations\
  \ I did not know existed on this campus, like Greeks (from actual Greece), Nepalese,\
  \ and Bangladeshis. For the latter two, you could see the striking resemblance of\
  \ their performance to that of the Indians; there was a vivid similarity - the dress,\
  \ the makeup, the style of dancing. And you can just tell that they were at some\
  \ point closely connected. Then there was the performance of the Chinese, whose\
  \ orthodox culture provided balance to the various exciting dances. Then there was\
  \ Africa - an entire continent, where sadly, the beautiful rendition of poetry echoed\
  \ pain, pride, self-respect, and the feeling of the the need to proclaim one's humanity.\
  \ As a Jamaican, I obviously feel a strong connection to my African roots. As a\
  \ descendant of slaves, I have heard the stories of oppression and know that feeling\
  \ all too well.\nIt is with this growth and personal development, that I can see\
  \ things through very different lens than I did five years ago. I understand now,\
  \ the importance of being our brothers' keeper. I understand now that we share this\
  \ earth, and one is not better than the other. I understand now, as a human being,\
  \ that people who took boats from Haiti and braved death, were coming to Jamaica\
  \ where we already didn't have much to offer - because they were so badly in need\
  \ of a better life that even the possibility of dying was worth it. \nAs someone\
  \ (borne from my sheltered upbringing) who has traveled to the US and has come closer\
  \ to understanding racism and xenophobia, I now understand a little bit more about\
  \ the sacrifice of immigrants. My previous views that supported sending Haitians\
  \ back to Haiti from Jamaica - where they would often meet certain death, is now\
  \ replaced with sheer compassion. After all, we never know when any unfortunate\
  \ circumstances will leave us at the mercy of others. \nIt is with this growth -\
  \ which I owe to my brothers and sisters from across the globe - that I can return\
  \ to Jamaica and impart knowledge and understanding to others, with the hopes that\
  \ one day, the world will be a better place. A place where we do not feel the arrogance\
  \ of determining the humanity of others based on any factor that defines them. Because\
  \ whether it comes in our accents, language, color of our skins, religion, culture,\
  \ sexuality, or even how we think as individuals, diversity is strength. And it\
  \ is an Oh So Beautiful thang! #OneLove"
