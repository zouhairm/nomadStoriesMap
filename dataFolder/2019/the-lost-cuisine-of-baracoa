Text: "Baracoa, a small city on the eastern tip of Cuba, is where Christopher Columbus\
  \ landed in 1492.   La Farola Highway, a serpentine road carved though a foreboding\
  \ mountain range, is the only road that leads to the town.  Prior to 1965, the only\
  \ way to reach Baracoa was by boat.  I was headed there for the food, said to be\
  \ different from everywhere else on the island.\n\nMy first stop in Baracoa was\
  \ Buen Sabor, a paladar that came highly recommended.  My waiter, Jairo, served\
  \ me an amazing, meal.  I thanked him and told him about my passion for international\
  \ cuisine and my quest to explore the world through food.  This began a dialogue\
  \ about Baracoa cuisine.  He told me about a local woman named Inalvis Guilbeax\
  \ Rodriguez, who has written the only cookbook on this cuisine.  He said he knew\
  \ her and offered to try to set up a meeting.  \n\nLater that evening, I received\
  \ exciting news.  Senora Rodriguez (Inalvis) would be at a presentation in town,\
  \ where the powers that be were working to get Baracoa Cuisine listed as part of\
  \ UNESCO\u2019s Intangible Cultural Heritage.  Without hesitation, I rearranged\
  \ my plans for the next day.\n\nI arrived that morning to see a room filled with\
  \ chefs from all the local paladars.  Many brought traditional dishes they felt\
  \ should be included in the presentation to UNESCO.  Then, Inalvis appeared and\
  \ the room stood still. She was a petite, dark haired, elderly woman with a smile\
  \ to light up a stadium.  I was introduced to her by Jairo and she insisted I sample\
  \ all the unique Baracoa dishes.  Inalvis later invited me to her home.  \n\nHer\
  \ home was an unassuming typical Cuban abode.  I felt immediately at home.   I asked\
  \ about life growing up in Cuba and where she found her love for cuisine.  She began\
  \ telling me about her quincea\xF1era, and how she was gifted her first cookbook.\
  \  One year later, at just 16, life took a dramatic turn. Her mother died unexpectedly.\
  \  Being one of seven siblings, she needed to help in the kitchen.  \n\nShe was\
  \ from a family of teachers, but her dream was to be a doctor.  That, however, would\
  \ not be her fate.  In 1958, the year she would start her studies, the revolution\
  \ happened.  Bombs were everywhere and her father forbid her to go to Havana to\
  \ medical school; it was simply too dangerous.  Instead she too became a teacher\
  \ just when Fidel Castro took over and \u201Ceducation for all\u201D, was the new\
  \ mandate.  She signed up to teach in the countryside with just one room and a blackboard.\
  \  She began teaching 15 and 16 year olds, first grade studies.  Prior to the revolution,\
  \ the people in the countryside received no education.  She said this experience\
  \ was the most rewarding of her life; seeing the progression of learning and the\
  \ momentous changes in these students.  \n\nAfter Fidel took over, the United States\
  \ imposed an embargo that stopped trade with Cuba.  Then, \u201CLa Libreta\u201D\
  \ or \u201CThe Ration\u201D book was introduced.  The USSR was supporting Cuba with\
  \ 5-6 billion dollars per year until their fall in 1991, when that subsidy abruptly\
  \ stopped.  Soon the rations were rationed; food was hard to come by and instead\
  \ of five eggs per person per month, it was two.  This is when Cuba entered what\
  \ Fidel named the \u201CSpecial Period\u201D.  It was during this time that Inalvis\
  \ discovered the \u201Clost cuisine of Baracoa.\u201D  \n\nSuddenly it was the country\
  \ folk, who became prosperous.  They knew how to live off the land.  The animals\
  \ they raised, the fish they caught, the fruits and vegetables they grew, were in\
  \ high demand.  Inalvis recalls the city folk giving the clothes off their back,\
  \ and their worldly possessions as trade, for food.  It was also when the true Baracoa\
  \ cuisine was rediscovered.  Dishes that were from a bygone era, re-emerged out\
  \ of necessity.  Inalvis was there to research and record this cuisine for her cookbook.\
  \  Dishes like teti', bacan, cucuruchos, and casabe, are now dishes served as delicacies\
  \ and treasures of Baracoa cuisine.  Dishes, that because of one woman\u2019s work,\
  \ just may put Baracoa cuisine on the world map."
