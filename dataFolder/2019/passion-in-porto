Text: "If Paris is the city of love, then Porto is the city of passion - as flamboyant\
  \ as the orange motel walls which surround frenzied lovers as they impatiently tear\
  \ off each other's clothes within 60 minutes of introducing themselves.\n\nFrom\
  \ the minute I set foot upon Porto's cobble-stoned alleyways for the first time\
  \ since I left my homeland for South Africa back in 1991, my heart was set on experiencing\
  \ the uncensored flavour of this vibrant city as an untamed, adult woman. Surrounded\
  \ by swarthy, devilishly handsome men who undressed me with their eyes against the\
  \ backdrop of coruscating walls, it was with this thought in mind that I set out\
  \ towards Praia da Luz in Foz, Porto.\n\nAs I reclined on the sun lounger, growing\
  \ friskier with each sip of champagne, I decided tonight would be the night of exploration\
  \ without expectation. I would be a lone wolf on the prowl, embracing the night\
  \ and all the adventures it had to offer. Later that evening, I roamed the streets\
  \ of Rua Galerias de Paris, one of Porto's hottest nightlife spots paved with lively\
  \ bars and clubs at every turn. In desperate need of resurrection from my sunshine\
  \ and champagne induced coma, Vodka and redbull would be the order of the night...along\
  \ with some cheeky tequilas.\n\nIt was at the Cento & Dezasseisthat club that I\
  \ met him, standing nonchalantly on the sidelines as a flock of Spanish bachelorettes\
  \ beckoned for me to dance with them. *Jorge, my dark and mysterious rogue, like\
  \ me had embraced the night in solitaire fashion. I introduced myself, apologising\
  \ for the national embarrassment that is my Portuguese, to which he gently reassured\
  \ me that my efforts merited nothing but warm endearment.\n\nWe began to dance,\
  \ merely swaying as separate entities at first. But as the blue lights danced across\
  \ his face, casting shadows which outlined the curves of his nose fit to smell the\
  \ roses, I flung my arms around his neck and whispered: \"How do you say, 'I want\
  \ to f**k you' in Portuguese?\"\n\nAnd then, we were kissing...\n\nHand-in-hand\
  \ and drunk with desire, we hailed a taxi. I unbuttoned the collar of his shirt\
  \ and ran my fingernails across his chest, my lips quivering at the electricity\
  \ of a purr arising from his throat. His veined, muscular hands caressed my thighs,\
  \ rummaging beneath the folds of my skirt as I hungrily bit his lower lip. I must\
  \ admit, I still feel sorry for the driver who despite the odds of disruptive symphonies\
  \ of ecstasy broadcasting from the backseat, remained focused enough to drive us\
  \ to the safety of a downtown motel. \n\nOnce in the privacy of a rather elaborate\
  \ room which could arguably give a 5 Star suite in London a run for its money, our\
  \ passion raged like the eruption of Vesuvius. Curled backwards over the bed's edge,\
  \ submerged in bath water, bent over the sink and pressed up against the mirror,\
  \ we left no corner of the room unturned. If it weren't for the toils of age and\
  \ too much alcohol, I am convinced we would have lasted forever. Even as we grew\
  \ more fatigued with each round, our hands had plans of their own. \n\n\"You really\
  \ are an awesome girl,\" he drawled in a thick Portuguese accent, his eyes locking\
  \ with mine before we fell into each other's arms all over again. \n\nAfter what\
  \ seemed like an eternity of vigorous love-making, the cold light of day launched\
  \ us back to reality. He called a taxi, and accompanied me to Sao Bento train station,\
  \ his rugged hands tenderly enveloping my own which seemed petite and dainty in\
  \ comparison. Somehow, I knew this intimate connection would be locked in the present,\
  \ never to be continued through the tediousness of digital correspondence. \n\n\
  In truth, I would have it no other way. For it is the fleeting nature of life\u2019\
  s most exhilarating experiences which inspire a sense of deep appreciation within\
  \ my heart, as I embrace spontaneity and delight in the afterglow of romance untarnished\
  \ by the rigours of a committed relationship. \n\nWith a final and lingering kiss,\
  \ we said our goodbyes."
