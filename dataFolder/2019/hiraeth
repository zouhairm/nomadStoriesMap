Text: "Ancient Berbers, Imazighen, proud and unconquerable guardians of their heritage\
  \ and the beauty of their country throughout the centuries. Free People.  Beautiful\
  \ hearts. Happy. Strong. Natural. Fierce. \n\nGolden sands of the Sahara softly\
  \ absorbing the chaos of the world, the serenity gently soaking into my soul. Calming.\
  \ Soothing. Healing. The beat of primal drums and deep, raw voices coursing through\
  \ my veins, bringing me to life. Pulsing. Rejoicing. Calling to me. Crackling fires\
  \ by Kilims covering the sand under the endless stars warming my heart, melting\
  \ hidden walls. Relaxing. Mesmerizing. Reaching to the stars. Welcoming smiles framed\
  \ by brightly colored turbans, making me feel at home.  Ele. Fatima Berber. Aisha.\
  \ Beautiful hand-woven fabrics gracefully flowing along the ancient sands, brightening\
  \ my spirit. Blues. Yellows. Oranges. \n\nGiant dromedars slowly lumbering along\
  \ the ageless dunes, tiny specks in the distance. Palm trees clustered by the oasis;\
  \ figs, herbs, crops methodically planted amongst them, precious water from wells\
  \ precisely guided to nourish life, all carefully tended by the families who depend\
  \ on them. Survival.\n\nThe simple peace of the countryside.  Dirt and rocks, rugged\
  \ mesas marked with pride for all to see. Raw, craggy clay mountains reaching to\
  \ the sky, snow-covered in the distance. Ancient kasbahs rising out of the clay,\
  \ then returning to the earth. Towns of sand and rock filled with hard-working people,\
  \ living their lives without our modern-day conveniences. Women of the mountains\
  \ tediously weaving their stories into beautiful Kilims. Goats, sheep, cows dotting\
  \ the landscape accompanied by their shepherds.  Donkeys tirelessly helping their\
  \ masters. Nomads and their herds in the desert and in crumbling caves. Green tree-covered\
  \ slopes, olives, oranges, Argan, pomegranates, apples, cactuses, dates, figs. \
  \ Snow-capped windy peaks with snaking treacherous paths for cars that don't belong.\
  \  Bright city of blue perched amongst the dark craggy peaks, reaching into the\
  \ clouds.  Fresh, clear air gently scented by cedar forests, Barbary Apes calling\
  \ in the distance. Salty ocean air with the smell of freshly caught fish being peddled\
  \ by the side of the docks, waves gently lapping against crumbling walls. \n\nAncient\
  \ bustling Medinas surrounded by modernity, winding ancient souks filled with skilled\
  \ artisans tirelessly crafting their ageless arts by hand in tiny little stalls.\
  \ Smells of exotic spices and foods, bright colors, noises of daily life, music,\
  \ haggling, laughter, beautiful languages, Muslim calls to prayer.  Ancient mosques,\
  \ arches, mosaics, gold, intricate carvings, beautiful doors to tiny homes filled\
  \ with life and love.\n\nHard existence. Full of simple unsurpassable beauty. Reminder\
  \ of the important things that get lost in our modern lives. Inspiration to live\
  \ with true meaning. Proud Maroc. Beautiful hearts. Free People. Love. Rebirth.\
