Text: "The night air smelled of market fish and spices, and the intense humidity mixed\
  \ with the sweat dripping down my face made me feel as if a layer of film had covered\
  \ my skin. I looked shiny under the fluorescent streetlights. Never had I imagined\
  \ I\u2019d find myself dancing in a place like this. A neighbourhood in Cebu that\
  \ displayed a rusty garage door and barbed wire fencing as its central point on\
  \ Google Maps.\n\nWorkout gear contrasted against the rustic backdrop of old cars,\
  \ low-hanging electricity cables, tired buildings, corrugated iron houses, and overcrowded\
  \ streets. The atmosphere was set alight by the tunes blasting through the sound\
  \ system combined with singing, laughter, and cheering. My friends and I were touring\
  \ the Philippines with our dance fitness programme from New Zealand - the founder\
  \ of which was a Philippina. This event was run by local dance groups for the community,\
  \ and we\u2019d been invited along. \n\nPeople of all ages had grouped together\
  \ outside the court to watch the night unfold. As I tried to follow the leader of\
  \ one of the local dance troupes, I couldn\u2019t help but watch my feet at the\
  \ same time, to ensure I didn\u2019t fall off the slightly slippery limestone stage.\
  \ I felt the eyes of the children watching us with excitement and eagerness. They\
  \ were dancing on the roof of a ute parked behind the fence, far less concerned\
  \ about falling off it than I was about falling off the stage. The rumba and heavy\
  \ bass had brought together the most unlikely people in an equally unlikely location.\
  \ \n\nI joined my team on the ground for the next few songs and interacted some\
  \ more with the little ones behind the fence. As the children pushed their tiny\
  \ fingers through the gaps, giggling as they copied my dance moves, I suddenly noticed\
  \ a boy with a ripped blue t-shirt standing to one side. His hands were crunched\
  \ into a ball, making circles over his tummy. The feeling of excitement to heartbreak\
  \ in a split second overwhelmed me in a way I cannot describe. \n\n\u2018Food?\u2019\
  , the boy next to him asked me, shyly. My frustration at my inability to help him\
  \ gave me a wave of all sorts of emotions, but I couldn't let those emotions overpower\
  \ me because I knew that my response could either add to his sadness or turn the\
  \ situation into something memorable for him, in a different way. He seemed a bit\
  \ distant from the other kids, and I realised the only thing I could do, at that\
  \ point, was to try to lift his spirits.\n\nI reached out my hand and showed him\
  \ how to do a high-five. Reluctantly, he came towards me. Before long we were pulling\
  \ silly faces at each other, and I gestured for him to dance with me. His mind was\
  \ diverted away from his hunger for those few minutes, and a hearty laugh left his\
  \ mouth. Though his joy was only temporary, something told me that this experience\
  \ would stay with both of us for a long time. It was as if every sad moment had\
  \ a flip side to it. Bonds formed in such a short space of time with children who\
  \ were reminding me just how much impact one simple interaction with another person\
  \ can have. \n\nAs the dancing ended, the children came rushing onto the court.\
  \ A short-haired little girl in an orange t-shirt as bright as her smile brought\
  \ me to her level and took my hands in hers. Before I realised what she was doing,\
  \ our hands had created a heart shape. Once I\u2019d mastered the technique, I was\
  \ engulfed by the cheers from her friends.\n\nCebu was a bustling hub of colour,\
  \ busyness, and horn-honking that equated to orchestral performances. A hybrid of\
  \ beauty and chaos. One the outskirts of its jungle of streets and busy people,\
  \ the music had taken me on a journey with children who seemingly had nothing yet\
  \ were so immensely rich in spirit and warmth. They showed me the rawest parts of\
  \ their little hearts and reminded me that no matter our background, we are all\
  \ the same, with a mutual need for connection."
