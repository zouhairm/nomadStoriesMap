Text: "There is no doubt, that each country has its own characteristics. In the world\
  \ we will not find completely identical cities. Therefore, a trip to a new place\
  \ is an adventure, during which you can find something unusual. But it'll make you\
  \ fall in love at first sight.\nWhen I was going on a trip to the Arab Emirates,\
  \ I didn't think, that I would get to Venice. The area, which is named \"Madinat\
  \ Jumeirah\", is a breathtaking local Venice with artificial channels. Here you\
  \ can boating or you can just sit on the shore in the shode. Also, you can walk\
  \ through the narrow streets of the local market. The market is built as an ancient\
  \ city in Europe with floating streets and low stone buildings. There is no glass\
  \ and concrete, everywhere there are greenery, canals and Arabic flavor.\nThis picturesque\
  \ place is able to please everyone. Shoppers will be able to bargain in the market\
  \ and buy unusual things. Lovers of quiet rest will be able to sit in a Cafe and\
  \ enjoy the views, there is no noise of megacities. Lovers of delicious food will\
  \ provide a large selection of dishes. The special atmosphere will not leave anyone\
  \ indifferent. \nWhat is more, in the evening this place turns into a fairytale,\
  \ when quiet streets of Arab Venice are illuminated by the warm light of lanterns.\
  \ \nArab Venice is a small miracle in the desert, that will surprise the most experienced\
  \ traveler."
