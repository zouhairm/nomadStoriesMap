Text: "Since childhood I wanted to travel the world, meet new people, see new places\
  \ and create new lasting memories \u2013 only thing that we actually have forever\
  \ preserved in our minds and souls.  I visited a lot of places in Europe, also I\
  \ was in America, but I have never expected that one day I will go to Australia\
  \ and  especially, to live here.  At once my social surrounding completely changed,\
  \ and I\u2019ve found myself living with people from all around the world with different\
  \ cultures who live together in peace.  In the very beginning I spent  most of the\
  \ time relaxing and exploring beautiful Melbourne. I didn\u2019t have any friends\
  \ or acquaintances here, only my boyfriend who works for the Australian bank. \n\
  It was a real challenge for me, to be honest, the one who decides to leave family,\
  \ friends and job in my lovely Montenegro. I knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy, but\
  \ it would be a lifetime experience and an amazing adventure. \n \nHowever, I would\
  \ like to focus on this amazing city. My idea is to tell more about Melbourne and\
  \ new promised land- Australia. Although I only started exploring the city and the\
  \ country itself, my first impressions is something that I want to sum-up and share.\
  \  After a couple of weeks I would say that this is a country of happy and free\
  \ people who try their best to live their lives in the right way. \nMelbourne is\
  \ a very big city, but without the stress of big cities. One can only feel happiness,\
  \ freedom and democracy. If I try to compare it with my homeland, Montenegro is\
  \ also one of the most beautiful countries in the world \u2013 rather small by its\
  \ size but with a breathtaking wild nature, but because of its hard past and traumatic\
  \ historical events \u2013 people are different.  They don\u2019t live how they\
  \ deserve. \n \nIn Australia it\u2019s completely fine to be different - you can\
  \ have blue or green hair, you can dance on the street, you can be totally weird\
  \ but nobody will look at you- \u201CWhat\u2019s wrong with you?\u201D Australia\
  \ accepts you as you are, without question \u201CWhat is your religion?\u201D or\
  \ \u201CWhich political party you belong?\u201D This is exactly what gives everyone\
  \ a possibility to be themselves, to work on their personal development and thereat\
  \ create healthy living environment. \n \nOne of the things that amazed me is the\
  \ nature.. You have everything- ocean, mountains, rivers\u2026 Australia is famous\
  \ for numerous beaches; I was awed with incredible sunsets, clear water and golden\
  \ sand. The experience further intensifies through new enthralling activities such\
  \ as surfing, swimming with dolphins or sharks. Also, you can choose between many\
  \ zoos with safari and make sure not to miss the chance to see the most popular\
  \ animals from Australia- kangaroo and koala. \nOn the other hand, in case you are\
  \ a fan of road trips you can just rent a car and go on a long drive along the great\
  \ ocean road with incredible view. Last weekend we did it and visited 12 apostles-\
  \ witness of a power of nature. This is a breathtaking place where you can just\
  \ stop, watch and be grateful to Mother Nature. \nOn the other hand, if you don\u2019\
  t have a car you can stay in one of the local parks bring your coffee and a book\
  \ and enjoy your time. \nOne thing you can never know in Melbourne is the weather\
  \ and temperature. Mostly it feels like you have four seasons in one day. \nHowever,\
  \ this is just a short overview of the paradise on the Earth, the ultimate point\
  \ in the world that you have to visit."
