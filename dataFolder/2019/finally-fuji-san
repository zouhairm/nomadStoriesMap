Text: "I had never felt so in love with a mountain until I saw Mount Fuji.  \n\nIt\
  \ was like seeing young Brad Pitt or Thor's Liam Hemsworth for the first time. \
  \ Star stricken, or on this case, mountain stricken I thought I would never get\
  \ over from this mountain fall figuratively speaking, ever again!\n\nMe and my sister\
  \ were on a family home visit in Davao City.  As a side trip, we instinctively booked\
  \ a five day visit to Tokyo, Japan as both of us shared some childhood fascination\
  \ with the Japanese culture, and had never been to. To see Mount Fuji at least once\
  \ in our lifetime was in fact on our priority bucket lists.  \n\nThe almost 3 hour\
  \ comfortable early morning bus ride from Shinjuku to Kawaguchiko presented a view\
  \ of transition from the ultra modern high rises of the city to an array of suburban\
  \ houses sprouting like grey samurai warriors at the battlefront.  Then slowly we\
  \ started seeing small trees, vegetation, farms and neatly manicured rice fields.\
  \ Old village houses seen while cruising along modern motorway that cut crisply\
  \ through mountains and rugged terrain.\n\nA day before we discovered this bus trip,\
  \ we took a day trip by train and bus to Hakone to see Mount Fuji via a ferry boat\
  \ in Lake Ashi but the heavy clouds and rainstorms at the lake stopped the ferry\
  \ from departing.  Drenched wet, we took a bus to the train station back to Tokyo.\
  \  We were totally sad and dismayed.   That night, we googled and checked other\
  \ ways to see Mount Fuji and found this very easy bus ride to Kawaguchiko.  \n\n\
  Second time lucky we were. \n\nThe first big passenger drop was on a theme park\
  \ hotel with an all white ferris wheel.  We could not understand our chubby but\
  \ friendly bus driver who was entertaining us with his soft teddy bear voice in\
  \ Japanese.  Every time he spoke on the speaker phone, we giggled delightfully as\
  \ we could never decipher what he was going on about.\n\nThe bus was just leaving\
  \ the hotel quickly from a maze of pine trees along the curvy road.  And then it\
  \ happened.  Some girls screamed \"Mount Fuji.... !!!\", and there we saw in an\
  \ instant the big picture that is Fuji-san, like we we were standing in front of\
  \ it.   The magnificence, ice capped against the baby blue sky,  in all its fame\
  \ and glory, the god mountain itself revealed looking at us.  And in a quick seconds\
  \ as the bus turned,  he was gone leaving us standing in awe, breathless, incapacitated.\n\
  \nWe have never imagined it was that gigantic but so real, so handsome, so sacred,\
  \ so god like.  No wonder it is the symbol of Japan.  The scene was like  looking\
  \ at the sky and if it is clear, imagine Mount Fuji appears in front of you and\
  \ really close and personal.  That was a surreal arresting experience we just had.\n\
  \nWe were stunned and then the bus stopped at the destination station and we we\
  \ were still searching for his perfect cone shaped appearance.  We found him again\
  \ now from a distance but still so serene, elegant and clean shaven with some clouds\
  \ hovering now and then.  We took another one hour tour bus to a location with a\
  \ lake and garden.\n\nMount Fuji was like a regal London palace guard on duty and\
  \ we could not imagine how it erupted in 1707.   As it was late April, we missed\
  \ the cherry blossoms festival but the grass flowers in fiery pink expanse provided\
  \ a carpet stark contrast as we sat, posed and savoured the moments.   \n\nThe garden\
  \ park was designed to pay homage to Mount Fuji-san and every plant, flower and\
  \ trees pointed towards their beautiful god.  There was no better time and place\
  \ where I truly appreciated nature in all its splendour.\n\nAfter a hundred and\
  \ one Iphone photos and videos, my sister and me were totally in love with Fuji-san.\
  \  As we took our bus back to Tokyo like two adrenaline high teenagers from a Maroon5\
  \ concert,  we planned our next visit again.   \n\nWould it be possible to come\
  \ closer and even hiked the god mountain?  I supposed so."
