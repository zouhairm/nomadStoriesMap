Text: "The winds were howling, the morning sky dark as night, the palm trees horizontal\
  \ as their fronds dripped with soggy downpour. After days of bluebird skies, I didn\u2019\
  t even think to look at the forecast. Had I done so, it may have altered the course\
  \ of my 5 day life awakening adventure.  \n\nWhen I arrived at the Mooloolaba marina,\
  \ the woman working advised me absolutely no boats would be leaving the harbour\
  \ that afternoon. I had a choice, I could listen to my rational mind and turn around,\
  \ never look back, get into the cozy car and call it a day. I was just a spare set\
  \ of hands anyway, bringing a feminine je-ne-sais-quoi balance to an all male, 5\
  \ person crew. But I couldn\u2019t walk away. Following my inquisitive heart, I\
  \ had to brave the open ocean, a dream since childhood while sailing with my dad\
  \ on a micro-sized river in Canada's capital. The lady was wrong, we were the only\
  \ boat that left the harbour that afternoon. \n\nWe had a time crunch, with just\
  \ 5 days to deliver the captain\u2019s 32 foot catamaran to the Whitsundays roughly\
  \ 600 nautical miles up the coast. I imagined pristine clear turquoise waters, dolphins\
  \ jumping in our wake as we sailed through rainbows towards the great barrier reef,\
  \ like all the quintessential images you\u2019ed expect to find in a google search.\n\
  \nWas I ever wrong. The moment we left the harbour, all hell struck loose as we\
  \ were met by a wave that had us all nearly catapulting into the shark infested\
  \ Tasman sea. The wave of doom was just the beginning to a seemingly endless chain\
  \ of inconceivable events. Among many, the captain losing his footing falling through\
  \ the canvas roof, after he had shown us - whatever we do, do not do that. To then\
  \ him and another crew member becoming violently seasick as they cleaned the galley\
  \ of shattered dishes and our non-seaworthy secured food supply. Then possibly the\
  \ most courageous/brainless man ever volunteering to be hoisted up the mast in a\
  \ 10 metre swell to retrieve an escaped halyard, whom I suspect secretly was vying\
  \ to be the next cirque du Soleil acrobat as he lost ahold and his exposed head\
  \ vigorously circled the giant metal pole while the boat rocked and rolled through\
  \ the ocean\u2019s madness. I couldn\u2019t bare to watch. Thankfully he grabbed\
  \ ahold and repelled down the very minute an ominous squall struck. \n\nWe then\
  \ foolishly set sail into the ferocious surf with rains so thick you couldn\u2019\
  t even see your elbows. One crew member passed out as he slipped on the slippery\
  \ deck\u2019s surface, all of us attending to him thinking the worst. He came to,\
  \ as I then proceeded to become ferociously ill.\n \nWith only 2 remaining capable\
  \ men standing to keep the boat upright and headed in the right direction, I questioned\
  \ my life as it flashed in fast forward before my eyes. For 48 hours, I lay on the\
  \ deck, exposed to the wild elements. A shivering statue unable to move as the untamed\
  \ sea illness took over my entire body, my hands and legs thoroughly numb, completly\
  \ soaked. I started praying for our safety and to see the light of day while imagining\
  \ my body held by solid ground. How did I get here, why did I write my will the\
  \ day before(!!), was this really it? It felt like the universe was laughing in\
  \ the face of my dreams. Could this nightmare be the finale to my life\u2019s story?\n\
  \nNope.\n\nWith nothing left to purge, I dry heaved over the side of the boat. And\
  \ then I saw the glow. The ocean sparkled as bright as the midnight sky, the bioluminescence\
  \ was out in full bloom. In the depths of my despair, I could see the world\u2019\
  s boundless beauty through the raging seas surface. I was humbly reminded that there\
  \ is always magic and light to be had, even in the darkest of moments. Had I not\
  \ been nauseated, I would have missed the most magnificent site I had ever seen.\
  \ The glimmering phenomenon gave me hope. For life, love, adventure, humanity, and\
  \ to never ever question your dreams."
