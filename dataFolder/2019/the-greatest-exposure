Text: "Ever since I was a little girl I dreamed about traveling overseas. Strange\
  \ lands, exciting places and new cultures have always fascinated me. I have always\
  \ wondered that it would be like to speak another language, to grow up learning\
  \ different customs and to live in a completely different way than I do now.\nThough\
  \ my dream didn't come true but we had a trip here in my country Tanzania we are\
  \ still have beautiful places to visit ,so I  with my friends decided to take a\
  \ visit and went to a camping trip last two years.The four of us drove out to peace\
  \ River ,where we rented some cancoes and rowed down the river  camping out at different\
  \ spots every night.The entire trip was absolutely amazing.\nOne day in particular\
  \ however, will remain in my memory forever. I will never forget the beautiful images\
  \ I saw and how I felt. The day began just like any other.  I woke up, stepped out\
  \ of my tent and observed all the beauty surrounding me . The sun was shining, the\
  \ birds were singing, the alligators were croaking and the bugs were buzzing ,without\
  \ saying a words we all sat down and had our breakfast and drank our special tea.\
  \ I looked around at everyone just then and I realized that it would be a day like\
  \ no other. \nThe water was so calm that day , the trees were more colourful than\
  \ ever before and with no help from the wind , they vibrated in the clear blue sky\
  \ . Everything was silent then , we were all too overwhelmed to really say anything.\
  \ All you could hear were the songs like sounds of nature. I swore that I could\
  \ make out a melody from those sounds and as I listened closer , the melody become\
  \ louder . Then I looked into the trees again and noticed they were still vibrating,\
  \ when I took a closer look I began to notice patterns in the leaves. Suddenly I\
  \ realized you can really find beauty in anything, All you have to do is look close\
  \ enough.\nAt that point I decided that I wanted to take a closer look at everything\
  \ surround me . I started passed the mirrored surface of the water and discovered\
  \ a whole new world laying beneath me.\nLastly the trip was marvelous and of it\
  \ is still vivid in my memory, it instilled faith in me and built camaraderie amongst\
  \ my peers and it has given me memories that I will cherish them forever."
