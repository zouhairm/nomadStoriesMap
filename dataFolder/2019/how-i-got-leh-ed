Text: "The Himalayas\u2026 If you listen carefully, the mountain winds will tell you\
  \ stories of the past. Stories of courage and sacrifice and hardships and love.\
  \ The flowing river\u2026 the only lifeline for the people living there. Nature\
  \ shows you, who you really are. How insignificant you are in this whole design.\
  \ A higher wind gradient level may trigger a landslide, a little higher temperature\
  \ may melt the glacial rivers and flood the roads earlier than expected. Every moment\
  \ of our life\u2026 nature\u2019s charity.\n\nAnd yet, for me, the only way to visit\
  \ those beautiful yet unforgiving mountains is on a bike. Ride your way to guts\
  \ and glory. Earn bragging rights for the rest of your life. Let nature take you\
  \ closer to yourself. One step closer to understanding who you really are. Realise\
  \ your priorities and understand that rest is all smoke in the grand scheme of things.\n\
  \nOf people and places\n\nYes, a ride through those roads can teach you a lot. And\
  \ if you are willing to listen\u2026 it can even guide you through the rest of your\
  \ life. Only if you are willing to listen. The terrain and the mountains will test\
  \ you. They will tease you, make you feel that you are nothing, totally helpless.\
  \ And then throw you a lifeline if they see fit. And yet, you return a more responsible\
  \ individual, a person with purpose, a better human being.\n\nDrawn by sights and\
  \ food\n\nPangong is a sight to behold and unlike anything you\u2019d have seen\
  \ before. The humungous Indian flag that flutters near the lake is a sight to behold.\
  \ Apart from the terrain and sights, another element I thoroughly enjoy during these\
  \ rides is the food we get along the way. To enjoy the evening breeze near Pangong\
  \ Lake with some hot chai and noodles is something I look forward to even today.\
  \ The reflection of the lake on a full moon night makes you feel closer to God.\n\
  \nOn the road\n\nThe terrain is as beautiful as it is dangerous. It changes completely\
  \ once you cross Rohtang and move forward. From the green slopes of Manali and Marhi,\
  \ the landscape changes to that of a cold desert after Rohtang. As you ride, you\
  \ will come across many waterfalls and patches of green on far-off slopes (be sure\
  \ to keep your eyes on the road or you might end up riding off the cliff!).\n\n\
  Into the nitty-gritty\n\nNow that I have the superlatives about the ride out of\
  \ the way, let\u2019s talk about the logistics of the ride. We started off from\
  \ Delhi and reached Manali on the second night. We stayed over in Manali for two\
  \ days before hitting the higher terrain. From Manali, we rode to Pang in two days\
  \ with one pitstop in between. Pang to Sarchu, again, took a day for us and from\
  \ Sarchu, it was all the way to Leh.  In all, we took four days for our bike trip\
  \ to Leh from Manali. There are riders who do it in less time.\n\nWe had lots of\
  \ punctures in between and, I fell sick for a night, so we decided to take it slow.\
  \ This is probably the best strategy to adopt while riding, as you need to factor\
  \ in for the unfactored as well. With Leh as the centre, we rode to Pangong Tso\
  \ and back in two days, and had a ride to Khardung La. After five days in Leh, we\
  \ rode to Srinagar and then to Jammu, and from there to Amritsar. By the time we\
  \ hit the plains, the ride became boring with monotonous highways. We decided to\
  \ wrap the ride up at Amritsar and took a train back to Delhi.\n\n\n\nA Ladakhi\
  \ saying which goes \u201Cthe land is so barren and the passes so high that only\
  \ the best of friends or the worst of enemies visit us\u201D. This is one ride where\
  \ you make friendships that last a lifetime. I know I have. We ended our ride with\
  \ a solemn promise to go back there again. When? We know not. But we will. Till\
  \ then, I have the fond memories of how I got Leh\u2019ed to keep me company."
