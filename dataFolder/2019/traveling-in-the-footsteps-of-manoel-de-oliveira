Text: "In a career that spanned nine decades from the 1920s to the 2010s, Manoel de\
  \ Oliveira was without question one of the most prolific storytellers in cinema\
  \ history. In terms of Portuguese cultural history, Oliveira was less a figure of\
  \ flesh and blood, but a fixture as timeless as the rocks and ocean swells along\
  \ the country's seaboard. His life story is a truly inspirational tale of drive\
  \ and persistence that I closely identify with. One of my favorite quotes from Oliveira\
  \ in regards to the nature of cinema goes like this, \"\u201CCinema is a mirror\
  \ of life. I believe that it is not one simple mirror, there is no other! Filmmaking\
  \ is the only reflection of life! As well as being a reflection of life, it is also\
  \ a record of life.\u201D This travel story would require me to first travel to\
  \ Oliveria's native Porto and then across the country to see where his film career\
  \ and Portugal's tumultuous twentieth century history intersect. \n\nThe mirror\
  \ between my own career as a filmmaker and Oliveria's will also be a running theme\
  \ in this work. He attempted to make his first film when he was nineteen, an unfocused\
  \ and overly ambitious project about Portugal\u2019s role during the First World\
  \ War. After a rainstorm destroyed the film equipment he rented from an exchange,\
  \ his cast and crew abandoned him, and Oliveira was left with a substantial debt\
  \ to repay the damages. When I was nineteen I formed a small independent production\
  \ company in my small university town in Pennsylvania. My involvement in local theater\
  \ circles and the university\u2019s communication\u2019s department gave me access\
  \ to all the tools I needed to bring to life a feature-length screenplay I had written\
  \ called The Filmmaker. Mirroring de Oliveria\u2019s own experience, on the second\
  \ day of what was supposed to be a three week long shoot to complete my first feature\
  \ film, I planned to film an elaborate scene on an abandoned railroad bridge, which\
  \ resulted in a torrential downpour that damaged much of the borrowed film equipment.\
  \ \n\nIn the time that it took to repair the rain-soaked equipment, my cast and\
  \ crew moved on to other projects, my credibility as a capable artist was shattered,\
  \ the film collective disbanded, and I spent the rest of my Junior and Senior years\
  \ of college paying an installment plan to cover all of the damages. For some such\
  \ an experience would likely have been taken as a sign to pursue another career,\
  \ but I have continued to persist, and perhaps more inspiring, so did Oliveria.\
  \ A few years later in 1931, he continued to dabble in the cinema, and appeared\
  \ as an actor in Song of Lisbon (1933), Portugal\u2019s first talkie. He made his\
  \ first directorial debut with a short documentary film, a genre that he would continue\
  \ to work with for the rest of his life.  Yet it wasn\u2019t until 1942 when he\
  \ was thirty-four, that Oliveria attempted to direct a feature film again.\n\nLater\
  \ in life, Oliveira was to divide his career into two phases. The first, which he\
  \ called \u201Cthe stage of the people\u201D, ran from 1931 to 1971. It consisted\
  \ mainly of documentaries and realistic dramas of the life of the poor and downtrodden.\
  \ Although the second phase of his career is where his greatest works would come\
  \ into the popular consciousness for the first time, I am at this time too far removed\
  \ to see how far-reaching the mirror of our lives will ultimately extend. What I\
  \ can certainly appreciate from examining the struggles that emerge from the first\
  \ four decades of his life, is his emphasis on recreating the truth to be found\
  \ in every-day life, as well as addressing a number of socially conscious subjects\
  \ that represent what he described as \u201Cparables of human solidarity.\u201D\
  \ It is the humanism in his early career that I would most like to emulate. By revisiting\
  \ the landmarks of his most notable films and attaching the his life story to my\
  \ own, I intend to tell a nuanced story of one of Portugal's greatest cultural contributors."
