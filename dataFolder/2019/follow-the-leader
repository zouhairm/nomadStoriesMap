Text: "Numazu, Japan.  Summer, 2003.  \n\nMariko has taken me to Johoku High School\
  \ with her, and now I'm surrounded by calligraphy students, listening to Sensei\
  \ explain the day's exercises, trying to pick out familiar words.  I speak enough\
  \ Japanese to carry a conversation with another person who's just beginning to learn\
  \ Japanese (these conversations never seem to get beyond the weather), but the sound\
  \ flies off a native speaker's tongue so quickly I can't tell when one word ends\
  \ and another begins.  I know I hear \"mina-san\", which means \"everyone,\" because\
  \ Hauptman Sensei says that many time a day, desperate to get our attention.  Mina-san,\
  \ mii-te kudasai.  Mina-san, kii-te kudasai.  Everyone please look.  Everyone please\
  \ listen.\n\nMy shoes are somewhere else.  You're not allowed to wear shoes inside\
  \ the building, so we've left them in a cubby down at the school entrance, and I'll\
  \ be able to get them back when Midori, Mariko's mother, picks me up for lunch.\
  \  Now I've got school issued slippers on my feet, wishing I had worn socks.  Mariko\
  \ brought her own pair from home - they're a bit more festive than my baby-girl\
  \ pink ones.  \n\n\"Do you know any kanji?\" Mariko asks.  I do.  I take the brush\
  \ laid out in front of me, and paint the handful of simple kanji I know.  Eye. \
  \ Sun.  Fire.  Water.  Child.  I write my name in katakana in the bottom right hand\
  \ corner, then again in hiragana, just to show off. \n\nIt's time to paint.  Sensei\
  \ draws the first character on the blackboard.  It's much more complicated than\
  \ anything I've had to do in my level two Japanese class.  I watch my host sister\
  \ deftly put the ink to paper, drawing the delicately complicated figures.  I pick\
  \ up my own brush, holding it awkwardly between my thumb and forefinger, the way\
  \ the other students do.  I copy Mariko's movements exactly.  Mine may not be as\
  \ confident as hers, but it's cleanly done.  Precise.  You can tell what it's supposed\
  \ to be.\n\nSensei stands behind me, waiting to approve my work.  He shakes his\
  \ head at my paper.  \"Too neat,\" he says.  \"Calligraphy is about brushstrokes.\
  \  We should see them.\"  He loads up the brush with ink and paints like a pro.\
  \  His kanji looks different than mine.  Just enough to make it look human.  \"\
  Like that,\" he says, and hands me the brush.\n\nI load my brush with too much ink,\
  \ and move too slow across the paper.  The ink leaves big wet blotches on the paper,\
  \ shapes bleeding together until the form is almost lost.  Sensei nods his approval,\
  \  and writes \"GOOD\" across the top of the page in red cursive.  His penmanship\
  \ is better than mine.  I\u2019m a little jealous.   \n\nSensei projects the list\
  \ of to-be-practiced kanji up on the wall; Mariko shows me the stroke order; every\
  \ kanji has a natural stroke order, and to not follow it would be to draw the kanji\
  \ incorrectly.  My technique improves just a little bit, but I'm not anywhere as\
  \ skilled as the other students.  The boy on my right flies his brush across his\
  \ paper.  He\u2019s been doing this for years.\n\nMariko waits until I finish the\
  \ last stroke, then crowds in to paint translations in the corners of my papers.\
  \  This one means \"smile.\"  This one means \"blue sky.\"  Tanoshii means \"funny.\"\
  \  Kokoro means \"heart.\"  Sensei circles back around with his red pencil.  He\
  \ writes a few quick notes on Mariko's own pages, then a second round of Good on\
  \ my papers, above what I consider my sloppiest kanji.  A paper like that would\
  \ get thrown out in my language class.  He must see how confused I am, because he\
  \ leans close and says, \"Calligraphy is human.  It is always beautiful, especially\
  \ when it is not so pretty.\"   \n\nAt the end of the class, Sensei gathers up my\
  \ good and not good papers, and layers them between sheets of newspaper.  He hands\
  \ me the bundle with a kind smile.  \"Good work,\" he says, and throws me a thumbs\
  \ up.  I might be a little proud.\n\nMariko takes my hand, and leads me back to\
  \ my shoes.  Midori is here to take me to lunch."
