Text: "Deep within the Midwest is a city often overlooked by many Americans, including\
  \ myself. Over the summer temperate weather and lush greenery brings everyone outside\
  \ where friendly faces and a multitude of activities wait to greet them; but the\
  \ true heart of Minneapolis, Minnesota emerges in the winter. In addition to the\
  \ token hospitality, the center of the Midwest spirit is their ability to not only\
  \ tolerate, but find ways to enjoy freezing temperatures. In conditions where most\
  \ other people simply attempt to survive, citizens of the Midwest have learned to\
  \ thrive. This became evident in 2019, as a polar vortex brought unprecedented,\
  \ far below zero temperatures. Seemingly apocalyptic weather to most, people of\
  \ cities like Minneapolis not only braved the weather and continued their day to\
  \ day activities, but many challenged themselves to find the humor at -50 degrees\
  \ Fahrenheit. Creating trends such as, throwing boiling water and watching it freeze\
  \ mid-air or freezing jeans until they stand up straight.\n\tAs a Florida to Colorado\
  \ transplant, I am accustomed to a mild winter at best, and my visit to Minneapolis\
  \ fortunately came after the vortex had passed. Even without the vortex, a Minneapolis\
  \ winter is far from mild. Over the past few years I had visited the city in July,\
  \ and been pleasantly surprised by how enjoyable it was. So finally, after three\
  \ years of a timid flirtation with the Midwest, an opportunity arose to dive right\
  \ in and experience what I thought would put a hard limit on my love for Minneapolis.\
  \ My tour guide, a born and raised Midwesterner, determined that the main event\
  \ of my stay would be the 10th Annual Winter Beer Dabbler, an outdoor beer festival.\
  \ In addition to what was an already intimidating feat, a snow storm decided to\
  \ grace Minneapolis the morning of the event. Arriving to the location of the event,\
  \ a desolate white landscape, in what appeared to be an abandoned fairground, welcomed\
  \ us. Through the snow trudged a line of people, bundled and determined. Following\
  \ the crowd through the snow, we finally came upon the event, far from desolate\
  \ or abandoned. Over 180 breweries and cideries brought booths to the event along\
  \ with an array of food trucks, and at the center was a silent disco and giant beer\
  \ pong. I quickly forgot about the cold, not only because of the beer, but because\
  \ I was fully entranced by the Midwest spirit. Looking around there were only smiling\
  \ faces, again possibly partly due to the beer, but also the comradery of people\
  \ making the best out of a seemingly bad situation. \n\tAfter sampling a fair share\
  \ of delicious beers, we made our way to the food trucks only to be greeted again\
  \ by exceedingly friendly people working the event. The Midwest spirit continued\
  \ in their love of cheese, an entire truck dedicated to gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches.\
  \ In an effort to fully be immersed in Minneapolis culture, I was obliged to order\
  \ one. As I enjoyed my warm mac n\u2019 cheese grilled cheese sandwich, I couldn\u2019\
  t help but think about how under appreciated Midwest culture is to many Americans.\
  \ Many don\u2019t venture to this part of the States outside of obligation, to visit\
  \ family or friends or for work, but it truly has so much more to offer. Not only\
  \ does it offer events and activities, but a culture of people who are able to make\
  \ it feel like home. At the Beer Dabbler in Minneapolis, people came together to\
  \ be outside and transform what others treat as cold and uninviting into a warm\
  \ and welcoming atmosphere. The Midwest city is a hidden gem, whether it\u2019s\
  \ a lovely vacation on a lake in the summer, or the heart of a vibrant culture that\
  \ surfaces in the winter. My love for the Minneapolis will definitely continue,\
  \ and it has taught me that sometimes the next beautiful place or exciting adventure\
  \ is right in your own backyard."
