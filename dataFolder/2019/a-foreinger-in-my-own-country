Text: "When I decided to study to be an English teacher, I wasn't completely sure\
  \ about how I was going to explain my students the huge opportunities that learning\
  \ a new language brings with it until I traveled to Salta.\nI'm from Chaco (in the\
  \ northeast of Argentina) and Salta is a North-west province in my country. It's\
  \ famous for its colourful views; when I mean views I'm not only talking about the\
  \ sightsees and mountains but also about very lively images of foods, vegetables,\
  \ fabrics, carpets, and the like.\nI was really excited to go around the city and\
  \ the surrounding places but when I got to the hostel with my friend we realized\
  \ that we were almost the only Argentinians in an Argentinian hostel; it was fullfilled\
  \ with Americans and mostly Europeans. I felt really anxious because this was a\
  \ great opportunity for me to practice my speaking skills, but my friend didn't\
  \ understand a word of English.\nThe first day went through with no problems at\
  \ all, but my friend started to feel annoyed at night, when everyone usually gathers\
  \ at the hostel to have dinner, barbacue or to go out. I started to drink beers\
  \ and to chat with everybody and I felt really joyfull because I never expected\
  \ to be practicing the language with English native speakers in my own country.\
  \ I tried to be gentle with my friend and started to translate everything to her,\
  \ but she was really upset for the situation and didn't bother to understand what\
  \ people were trying to say even with body gesture.\nThe next day we had a tour\
  \ to the saltworks and the other two women that were going with us were French.\
  \ The tourist guide explained absolutely everything in English of course, because\
  \ it is the universal language. Again I was delighted and my partner felt uncomfortable.\n\
  And the days passed and we wandered for about a week visiting historical centers,\
  \ learning about pre-Columbian Inca culture, seeing colorful and wonderful landscapes,\
  \ eating local delicious food and appreciating the people who work so laboriously\
  \ their land that respects so much, their Pachamama. Pachamama is a concept that\
  \ comes from the Quechua language. Pacha can be translated as \"world\" or \"Earth\"\
  , while mom equals \"mother\". That is why it is usually explained that the Pachamama\
  \ is, for certain Andean ethnic groups, Mother Earth.\nWe learnt a lot about their\
  \ race, and we realized that despite being so close, we are such a big country that\
  \ we have many differences in terms of uses, customs and above all things: moral\
  \ values. The people of the northwest take advantage of every bit of land they have\
  \ to plant whatever the land can give them.\nWhen we returned, I was still studying\
  \ at the teachers training college and because of this trip I was given a lot of\
  \ ideas in my head about how to approach the language to my potential students,\
  \ since they always state that learning a foreign language would not help them at\
  \ all; that they will not have the opportunity to travel abroad. As most of the\
  \ students in the public schools of the neighborhoods or the outskirts of the city\
  \ are of low class and very humble they do not see how profitable it can be to study\
  \ a language. \nThanks to that trip, I not only knew a beautiful part of our country,\
  \ but it also helped me and marked me to learn to transmit that knowledge to my\
  \ students that you do not have to travel so far to communicate with a person in\
  \ another language. And thanks to that trip my friend not only became my best friend\
  \ but also started to be my pupil."
