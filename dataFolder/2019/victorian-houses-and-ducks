Text: "It was a Monday. I woke up in the forenoon, still knackered from working 7\
  \ days straight. I grabbed a banana, dolloped the porridge in a bowl, and made myself\
  \ a cup of tea for breakfast. I sat on the footstool, and chatted with my friend.\
  \ Life\u2019s choices, consequences and chocolate chip cookies. I dwelled on the\
  \ choices and the cookies. \n \nI've been feeling like I've been making poor life\
  \ choices. I started to blame it at work, and then it snowballed to my decision\
  \ to leave the Philippines. My dream, my big plan. To travel across the world to\
  \ the land of Harry Potter, scones and tea time. These thoughts were responsible\
  \ for my then recent string of cookie binges.\n\nIt was 17oC in London. The sun\
  \ was calling. But so was the bed. But the sun. Oh, the sun. The days of living\
  \ in a tropical country. I showered, put on anything comfortable that I found and\
  \ stepped out. The sun did not disappoint.\n\nI live in Somers Town, Camden, Central\
  \ London. Camden is a famous haven for tourists and urban explorers: bustling with\
  \ quirky spots, off-license stores, and charity shops. I\u2019m a 3-month resident\
  \ but I have not explored anything aside from the occasional visits to the grocery\
  \ to buy a loaf of bread or fresh produce for my favorite sour pork soup.\n\nThat\
  \ day, I wanted to go to Camden Market, one of the largest and most famous London\
  \ food markets. One thing about me: I get excited about traveling but I'm naturally\
  \ poor with directions. I swear, streets are altered during nighttime and daytime.\
  \ So I made sure I remembered my friend\u2019s simplified instructions: Go straight\
  \ and turn left at the fork in the road where HSBC is. Landmark: American Candy\
  \ store. I succeeded and while I celebrated my mini victory, my eyes feasted on\
  \ the sights: Enormous trainers hanging on a store, a black-and-orange dragon sprawled\
  \ on the wall of a Chinese restaurant and a series of tattoo, art, and souvenir\
  \ shops. \n\nI knew I was getting closer to my destination. I could smell grilled\
  \ fish, barbecue, and grease. It started to get congested. There were tents, tables,\
  \ and people everywhere - on the sidewalk, on the steps, literally anywhere that\
  \ they can stand to shove food into their mouths.\n\nBut as much as my senses were\
  \ enthralled by all of these, I got sidetracked by the less trodden path to Regent\u2019\
  s Canal.\n\nRegent\u2019s Canal is a long stretch of water lined with boats and\
  \ ducks gracefully gliding through. It was a welcome refuge from the city, within\
  \ the city. I found my spot on the row of benches on the towpath. I sat there for\
  \ half an hour. I felt a sense of peace, as though hope had just knocked out the\
  \ chaos in the world. After finishing the packet of rice crackers I brought with\
  \ me, I was off again. \n\nI happily walked past the back of the zoo, an aviary,\
  \ Victorian houses, and some cyclists when I saw them. Two large birds along the\
  \ towpath. I am scared of big birds. I fear they\u2019ll attack me with their sharp\
  \ beaks. The up close sight of them gave me shudders. With my heart racing, I walked\
  \ past them, holding my breath, anticipating a defensive sprint. Nothing happened.\
  \ I continued my journey with a sigh of relief.\n\nThe end of the canal was still\
  \ a long way off. The sun was setting and I did not want to miss dinner. I decided\
  \ to make my way back. Armed with my newfound bravery from passing the birds, I\
  \ dared myself to choose a different route. No way was I going to go back for a\
  \ second bird encounter. \n\nShortly after, I was back in the familiar. As I weaved\
  \ through people going about their daily, I looked back on my day and my choice\
  \ to migrate. I realized any worthwhile journey had distractions, discoveries and\
  \ deterrents. But if you keep on going, you keep daring, you eventually end up where\
  \ you\u2019re supposed to be.\n\nAs I buzzed myself into our flat, I found myself\
  \ thinking. \u201CThis is London. This is home.\u201D"
