Text: "I like to think I\u2019ve got an open mind when it comes to other cultures.\
  \ I am fascinated by how different people think, eat, dress, celebrate and survive\
  \ around the world. Humanity is endlessly diverse, and usually, I am all for it.\
  \ However, while in Korea I was confronted with a scene that put my acceptance of\
  \ cultural differences to the test.  \n\nIt was a crisp autumn evening, the moon\
  \ was full, and I was enjoying the short walk from my hotel to Deokcheon, a small\
  \ district outside of Busan with a bustling nightlife. As I made my way, I wandered\
  \ past a traditional market and was instantly intrigued. The bright lights, wafting\
  \ smells and hustle and bustle of local life tempted me inside for a quick detour.\n\
  \nI browsed several of the wide aisles, taking in all the sellers had to offer.\
  \ Fresh fruit and vegetables, meat and seafood, kitchen supplies, piles of plastic\
  \ slippers, steaming corn on the cob in metal cauldrons, huge plastic sacks of rice\
  \ crackers and large vats containing more types of kimchi than I\u2019ve ever seen\
  \ before. Everything was arranged neatly and lit up by exposed lightbulbs dangling\
  \ from the rafters above. The variety was overwhelming.\n\nIt was getting late and\
  \ the stalls were closing for the evening. It was time to get back on my way to\
  \ the nearby bar street. I took a shortcut out through a small alleyway and instantly\
  \ felt on edge. \n\nAlong the wall, there was a large cage raised off the ground\
  \ by stilts with several dogs inside. I braced myself for their loud, angry barks.\
  \ I was sure they\u2019d be wary of a stranger passing through their territory.\
  \ But the barks never came. Instead, the dogs remained curled up, only glancing\
  \ at me for a quick second. \n\nI took a few more steps and saw more cages with\
  \ more dogs. That\u2019s when it hit me. These were not guard dogs; they were meat\
  \ dogs. I had wandered into the dog meat section of the market. The look of complete\
  \ misery and despair on their faces said it all. I was horrified. \n\nUp to this\
  \ point, I had always thought eating dog was acceptable. I didn\u2019t plan to ever\
  \ try it myself, but that wasn\u2019t to say that other people in different parts\
  \ of the world shouldn\u2019t. When you\u2019re hungry, you eat, and for some people\
  \ that might mean consuming dog.\n\nBut then, seeing an animal that had so clearly\
  \ resigned itself to death, huddled in a cage surrounded by the stench of those\
  \ slaughtered before it, really made me question the morality of eating dog. I was\
  \ brought up with pet dogs and know how to read their emotions. It was incomprehensible\
  \ to me that anyone could look at these dogs and still have the heart to eat them.\n\
  \nMy first instinct was to try and open the cages to set them free. How could I\
  \ just leave them there? It\u2019s one thing to have an animal look at you with\
  \ puppy-dog-eyes to beg for a snack, but it\u2019s a completely different experience\
  \ when it\u2019s begging for its life. \u2018I should come back with bolt cutters,\u2019\
  \ I thought to myself.\n\nI hurried out of there, almost running out of the market,\
  \ no longer interested in any of the shops that were still open. Once I was a few\
  \ blocks away, I took a moment to calm myself down. This wasn\u2019t my culture\
  \ and it definitely wasn\u2019t my right to interfere. I just had to accept the\
  \ fate of these dogs. Anyway, where exactly was I going to find a pair of bolt cutters?\
  \ \n\nI decided to put it out of my mind. Yet, as I sat drinking ice-cold hof and\
  \ nibbling on fried chicken, all I could feel was shame. Shame at the people who\
  \ trade dog meat, shame at the people who eat it, but most of all shame at myself\
  \ for having reached the limit of my cultural understanding. Korea had presented\
  \ me with a serious challenge and somehow, I had failed."
