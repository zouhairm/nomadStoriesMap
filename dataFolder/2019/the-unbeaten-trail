Text: "Shivering inside a thick fur blanket & sipping a  hot coffee wouldn't calm\
  \ my craving for excitement which was for the hiking trip I took early in the morning\
  \ through the dense rain forests of Western ghats in India to reach one of its highest\
  \ hill peak called Narasimha Parvatha.\nMy mind was shouting to do it all over again.\
  \ My eyes rolled towards the phone lying nearby, I smiled as this holds the proof\
  \ of moments & memories of the wild adventure I had. Thoughts triggered recalling\
  \ the journey experience beginning with a bumpy ride to Kigga village from where\
  \ I started my hike, finding a local boy who knew the path to reach the mountain\
  \ top through rain forest, bribing the forest guard to let me through ( trekking\
  \ to some parts of western ghats is banned during rainy season), hiking along the\
  \ mountain trails, crossing small streams, walking beneath the thick canopy of overgrown\
  \ trees, avoiding the brier patch, making way through the high rise grass, climbing\
  \ rocky boulders till I finally reached the mountain top.\nUp above it's a different\
  \ experience altogether. The untouched nature was so lush green and wild.  A small\
  \ stream had a very fresh water which I happily refilled to my water bottle. The\
  \ view of  green mountains, the drizzling rain, breeze of fresh air  makes body\
  \ and soul lighter. I spent hours sitting & staring at the nature up there.  Shared\
  \ my lunch with the boy who was my guide for the day. \nHeavy rain started as we\
  \ began our decent back to the village. Half way through, I took a wrong turn  &\
  \ went to a different path. Got lost for more than a  hour. It was getting darker\
  \ and all trails were looking same to me.  Something made me feel that I was in\
  \ the wrong direction. Somehow I started back to the place where I took wrong turn.\
  \ Through out the journey, there is no mobile network but one place by the rock,\
  \ there was a strong signal. I made a call to the forest guard whom I met in the\
  \ morning. He assured my rescue. \nThe jungle was in complete darkness. Sounds of\
  \ animal crying could be heard from far away mad me fear. Even the rain was getting\
  \ worse. i was totally drenched. I waited in darkness. After an hour, the search\
  \ party arrived. The guide boy was also there. He was sorry for me.  We hiked back\
  \ to the village.\nDue to my delay in return trip, I missed the bus back to my home.\
  \ The guide boy invited me to his home and offered me the night stay. I took a hot\
  \ bath, and wrapped myself with a thick fur blanket. Though I felt angry and bad\
  \ for getting stuck in the jungle, sipping the hot coffee I  started thinking...\n\
  If I had not thought of taking this trek, I wouldn't have experience the wild and\
  \ unplanned adventure through an unbeaten path of Western Ghats.\nIts always best\
  \ to thoroughly pre-plan the adventure hikes in advance but sometimes little mis-adventures\
  \ bring more happiness..."
