Text: "One day I was washing my bike and I thought \"it's time to do crazy with her\"\
  . \"The donkey\", as I usually call her, it's very simple: it's a blue bike, iron\
  \ frame and comfortable saddle. She's my travel companion.\nI live in Cartagena,\
  \ a city of sun and beach. I wanted to know Medell\xEDn, the \"Capital of the mountain\"\
  , the only city with metro in Colombia. \"How will I get there? I'll do it on the\
  \ donkey\", I said.\nI set up a seven-day travel schedule in which I would sleep\
  \ every day in a different municipality, in stays.\nThe first day of travel I woke\
  \ up at five in the morning and went out at six in the morning of Cartagena heading\
  \ to San Onofre, Sucre. Inside my shoes were my card and some money, I didn't want\
  \ to be stolen. The Road was eternal: 104 km in six hours and 31 minutes. That day\
  \ I saw a duck and his children on a lake.\nIn San Onofre I withdrew money that\
  \ my mom sent me (so it was every day), I located in the park, had lunch in a restaurant\
  \ and then looked for lodging in front of the road.\nMy next destination was Sahag\xFA\
  n, C\xF3rdoba. During the tour I met the monument of a hat in Chin\xFA, C\xF3rdoba.\
  \ That day I met a christian man who told me about God and invited me to church.\
  \ I accepted.\nThe next day I saw the broken glass of a bus covering the Cartagena-Medell\xED\
  n route. Inside it was a great friend who survived an accident in which five people\
  \ died before my first day of travel. When I arrived in Buenavista, C\xF3rdoba,\
  \ I was in a hairdresser. While my hair was cut I was told that a Brazilian had\
  \ walked from his country to Medell\xEDn.\nThe fourth day of my tour I met a very\
  \ beautiful city called Caucasia, located next to the river Cauca. Crossing over\
  \ very big bridges on my bike and contemplating the paradise of nature was very\
  \ pleasant despite fatigue. I slept in Taraz\xE1, the last place located in flat\
  \ terrain.\nMy skin was darker than usual because every day was between five and\
  \ seven hours exposed to the sun. That ended the fifth day because I started to\
  \ climb the mountain on my bike, the more it was less hot. Climbed 19 km that day.\
  \ My effort was rewarded with the view of the huge mountains and clouds by my side.\
  \ It was 1300 meters above sea level, in a municipality called Valdivia, Antioquia.\n\
  The sixth day was higher than the previous one. I traveled 38 km up. I could see\
  \ that the mountains arise small cold water currents. It's very delicious. That\
  \ calmed my fear, because that day was in areas controlled by Colombian terrorist\
  \ groups; I didn't want to lose my life. Every kilometre tour was slow and a gain\
  \ for my legs. During the tour my mind repeated a song called \"The poet and the\
  \ pendulum\" by the Finnish band Nightwish. I slept in Yarumal, Antioquia, 2300\
  \ meters above sea level.\nThe last day of travel was very long and full of elevations\
  \ and decreases on the road. I thought a lot about a story they told me: a peasant\
  \ had defeated several professional cyclists in a competition. That motivated me\
  \ to pedal more while I was leaving cold steam from my mouth. Besides the mountains\
  \ by my side, I was able to meet the tree tomato tree, the ingredient of a very\
  \ delicious juice.\nI saw people practicing paragliding in the heights of a very\
  \ big hill. Then I went down about 25 km in which the curves on the road were a\
  \ hard challenge: my hands and my brain were connected, always thinking about not\
  \ crash.\nBefore arriving to the city the bike suffered a puncture on the back tire.\
  \ Repairing it was a drama that took like two hours. After this i advanced almost\
  \ 20 km, proud to see a notice that said \"welcome to Medell\xEDn\", after 10 hours\
  \ 38 minutes of tour. That day I slept with a smile on my face."
