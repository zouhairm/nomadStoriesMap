Text: "Well, I could start saying how much was exciting my first trip outside my country,\
  \ but it's not true. It was just a way to learn alone how to plan my next trip,\
  \ let me explain:\nI just decided to travel to Chile because I was very stressed\
  \ in my company, with less money and it was my time to risk a travel.\nI think that\
  \ it would be a easy trip, because spanish looks like portuguese (in my mind), Chile\
  \ it's close , not expensive and I already stay in hostel in some trips here in\
  \ Brasil, soooo that's fine.\nWhat I couldn't know it's: everything is different,\
  \ some words in spanish is very difficulty to understand and the chilean people\
  \ speak so fast that you feel like listening a music from Eminem... so lost, the\
  \ food have others seasonings and the weather is really different from Brazil.\n\
  The city os Santiago del Chile is like S\xE3o Paulo, much cars and people, various\
  \ stores but one think I really appreciate: they have a lot of beautifull squares...\
  \ You can just sit and chill a little and you will see other people doing the same\
  \ and take some time, anda the most impressive is people wich differente types:\
  \ a business man, a mom with kids, a group of girls just getting out from school,\
  \ homeless people and tourists like me, and I loved! \nThe weather... You really\
  \ need payu attention not just with it will rainy or not, need to know better about\
  \ altitute, how dry or not is the air and how to survive when your body feel theses\
  \ differences. In my case, I suffered because i have rhinitis and Chile is more\
  \ high and dry than Brazil so, was really difficulty to breathe there and I felt\
  \ some headaches during the tours.\nThe food and water: Hummm, the food is very\
  \ good and they cook a lot of \"pollo\" or chicken ( Breaking Bad saving my life\
  \ when I remember \"Pollos Hermanos\" and figured out that pollo is chicken ) but\
  \ I missed the beand form Brazil, a lot! The meat is wonderfull but a little expensive,\
  \ and my plan was: I want one day of my trip to go to a traditional restaurant and\
  \ eat like a boss, so the other days I went to a market and by my own food and cooked\
  \ in hostel. I made it, I ate the most delicious steak that I ever ate in my life\
  \ in my last day there.\nWhat you dont expect it's the water, they have a sort of\
  \ types of water! They have alkaline water, normal water m water if a little gas\
  \ , water with more gas, water with low sodium and normal sodium... and my first\
  \ time of course I was just thirsty and just took the first water that I saw, bad\
  \ mistake, alkaline water.... not good my friends, not good!!!! \nAbout the hostel:\
  \ I learned if you travelling alone, stay ina closer and nice hostel, pay a little\
  \ more but you can make more friends and can just go out fora a walk and it will\
  \ be better than my experience. I took a hostel in downtown , not so close and with\
  \ a few people, and basically I stayed alone...I really didn't liked and learnd\
  \ the experience.\nTourist Tour: Because it was my first time, I was prepared to\
  \ be the traditional tourist, so I bought tours EVERYDAY! I was exciting to know\
  \ everything about Santiago, Val Paraiso, Vi\xF1a Del Mar e Embalse Y Eso... That's\
  \ its a wrong way to tourist, because you can make tour in the city for free, it\
  \ some guides for there in hotel, hostel, airport, these packages for tourist begin\
  \ so early that u cannot enjoy a good breakfast and wake up hurry and you feel very\
  \ tired in the end of the day. \nWell, what I learned is to speak with other people,\
  \ search a lot and reserve some days for you, to explore the city and citizens and\
  \ to rest too! Because it's a fact : U will not know everything about your trip\
  \ in one week."
