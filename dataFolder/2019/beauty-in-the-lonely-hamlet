Text: "Many parts of Romania are still unknown and exploring them is like going back\
  \ in time to the dark ages. Me and two friends of mine decided to escape the city\
  \ and go hike the western Carpathian mountains. So with the tents on or back and\
  \ everything else we might need, we took a train to a fairly remote mountain aria.\
  \ The woods gave us a sense of spiritual peace, you could feel the wind caressing\
  \ the skin as you inhaled the pine scented breeze. After two days of hiking and\
  \ exploring iced filled caves we decided to move further to a place that was not\
  \ on our map, estimating it will take about seven hours.  Going deeper into the\
  \ woods we slowly realized that we might be lost but after about four hours we finally\
  \ came upon a man gathering wood. Approaching him we asked for directions but the\
  \ man seemed strange and amazed to find hikers in those parts of the woods. He assured\
  \ us that this was the right way and it would take us only a couple of hours to\
  \ get to our destination one of the most spectacular glacial caves in our country\
  \ named Sc\u0103ri\u015Foara. However, the way the man spoke kind of spooked us\
  \ and after about a couple of hours we did not arrive at our destination instead\
  \ we reached a remote hamlet on top of some hills. There were about ten houses,\
  \ but they all seemed abandoned and as clouds were gathering and it started raining\
  \ the only thing you could hear were dogs barking in the distance. The fog emerged\
  \ from downhill but just when everything was as gloomy as it could get we stumbled\
  \ across an old woman with her grandson. Happy to finally come across someone, we\
  \ offered them some cans of meat that were getting a bit to heavy in our rucksacks\
  \ and the kind woman offered us in exchange fresh milk and bread baked in a stone\
  \ oven. We thanked her for the hospitality and gave her grandson a chocolate bar,\
  \ he was so happy, you have to understand these houses did not have electricity\
  \ or running water so the young child might not even known that particular sweet\
  \ taste. It was a beautiful moment in the middle of nowhere that showed us the beauty\
  \ of the human spirit can be found anywhere even in remote and isolated places such\
  \ as those. We said goodbye and wished them well and after about twelve hours in\
  \ total we reached our destination. In the end everything made our journey wonderful,\
  \ the woods, the mountains, the caves, the serenity ... but the thing that was most\
  \ memorable for me was the meeting of two different worlds through the beauty of\
  \ sharing and finding human warmth in a place forgotten by time."
