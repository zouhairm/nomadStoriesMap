Text: "A small notebook had influenced our decision about where to spend the holiday.\
  \ Dating from 1923, it belonged to Jos\xE9 Dias, my husband's grandfather. He had\
  \ come to Brazil from Cape\_Verde. In Brazilian lands he\_got\_married and had 3\
  \ children. In his notes,\_few\_informations about his trajetory. Just\_some streets\
  \ names from the capital of S\xE3o Vicente, Mindel, baptism records of their 4 children\
  \ born there, dates of his displacements to Santo Ant\xE3o (his native island) and\
  \ rather non sense phrases such as \"skipping a stick\" and \"stick a\_nickel\_\
  with a needle\".\nWhat did we know about the country? Not much. That it had been\
  \ a colony of Portugal, and\_this\_somehow\_\"united us\" . A country made up of\
  \ 10 volcanic islands, which official language\_is\_Creole and had a mild climate;\
  \ which history and landscapes were eternalized in the voice of Ces\xE1ria \xC9\
  vora.\nThe curiosity to enter African lands, and our ancestrality would lead us\
  \ to an unknown contact. We bought tickets, booked accommodation and the rest would\
  \ be given spontaneously\_through the 7 days ahead.\nUpon arrival the scenery amazed\
  \ us. A sea of a very clear blue, surrounded by high hills. On the seashore many\
  \ shells and the wind blowing incessantly.\nThe following days, we walked in a beautiful\
  \ landscape, with few buildings, a free horizon and where we felt safe.\nWe visited\
  \ food and handicraft markets, the coast, cultural centers, galleries and museums.\
  \ We had delicious salmon slices accompanied by boiled vegetables and fresh juices.\n\
  At night we went out in search of the mornas, coladeiras and funan\xE1s, traditional\
  \ Cape Verdean rhythms.\nEven in the midst of this pleasant journey we felt that\
  \ the search for the family\_roots was a loud voice inside our heads.\nThen we proceeded\
  \ to follow indications given by Jos\xE9 in his notebook;\_Esperan\xE7a Street was\
  \ one of them\_, where one of his daughters was born.\n\_An unpretentiously walking\
  \ took us to a simple house\_with no gates\_- like many in the city -\_an open wooden\
  \ door motivated us\_to address those who lived there asking for clues of possible\
  \ members of the Dias family. A very solicitous man said he didn't know\_anything\_\
  about it but he took us to meet other people, that might have any information about\
  \ the subject, but equally, unsuccessful.\nSo we were advised to go to the local\
  \ radio station to express our desire to meet some relatives. Taken from an investigative\
  \ spirit we went to the radio, where they welcomed us in a very cordial manner and\
  \ with interest in the\_story. After telling them\_about what\_took\_us there, a\
  \ lady led us to the studio, where my husband talked about her ancestors and asked\
  \ to any likely relatives of Dias family to manifest themselves in any way.\nThe\
  \ next day, visiting the municipal library, we received a call from a radio employee\
  \ warning us that a possible relative had gone in search of more details. So we\
  \ set the meeting to be held a few hours later.\nWhen this woman came across us,\
  \ we could notice that her features didn't hide the resemblance to the Brazilian\
  \ part of the Dias family. She had brought some photos and from the conversation\
  \ about the family tree of both, we realized that they were cousins. And the biggest\
  \ surprise came when she told us that her aunt named Bia, one of Jos\xE9's daughters,\
  \ was a 90 years old lady, and lived in Mindelo. It was my husband father's sister.\n\
  We were ecstatic, barely able to wait for the moment to meet her. So we went, to\
  \ the Ch\xE3 of Faneco, a neighborhood considered peripheral in the city.\nWhat\
  \ a magical moment we found Aunt Bia! Also when we saw the portrait of her father\
  \  on the wall of her house; it was the photograph that had always been a reference,\
  \ also, to the family he formed in Brazil! When we crossed the Atlantic Ocean we\
  \ had no idea that we would return to our country with the bond, which had been\
  \ broken for about 80 years, restored."
