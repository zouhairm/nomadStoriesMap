Text: "I was walking on the rails of an old railroad, balancing myself, feeling the\
  \ breeze, the sun, hearing the swinging trees and birds and people around me, with\
  \ a distant sound of a stream. Sounds of a good saturday. It was a weekend camp\
  \ and trekking trip, and I had met most of the group at the day before. At that\
  \ moment we were returning to our camp, sun was setting. After the whole trip, I\
  \ remembered of when I was so shy and introverted that I probably wouldn't have\
  \ conversations with so many new people. I used to have a feeling of loosing myself,\
  \ of being unable to be me and part of a group at the same time. But many things\
  \ changed, and these interactions became some of my favorite things. \n        \
  \    Back to balancing myself on the rails. I was really concentrated. After a day\
  \ walking, everybody was tired, the group had split a little bit, and I was with\
  \ the slower guys \u2013 it was so good to hang out in that ambience that we didn't\
  \ want to hurry.  I always enjoyed trying to balance myself on the curb. I associate\
  \ this habit with a deeper desire to find my own way, in the middle. Do I prefer\
  \ being alone in nature or surrounded by people in the city? Both, while trying\
  \ to avoid the extremes of identifying too much with one or another. Adaptation.\n\
  \            We reached one viaduct, with green mountains at both sides, rivers\
  \ at distance, a blue sky with soft white clouds. It was high, but the sinuosity\
  \ of the land gave the sensation of being in the middle, not just at the top. I\
  \ stopped for a moment and leaned on the small concrete wall, my group kept walking.\
  \ Looking at that imensity, feeling that warmth, the trees swinging gently with\
  \ the wind... I felt that I was too swinging gently. That feeling of connection\
  \ the yogis talk about? A glimpse of it. A fulfilling sensation of no-time and no-space,\
  \ everything was everything, tranquil joyfulness. \n            I stayed there for\
  \ a few moments, just breathing and being there, untill I thought of following my\
  \ fellows. I returned to balancing myself on the rails, even happier then before,\
  \ and a few meters ahead was one of the best moments  of the whole trip: they were\
  \ talking, seated on the trail, waiting for me. I never expect no one to wait or\
  \ do something for me, even and especially when I do something for them, and at\
  \ that moment I saw that I didn't need to expect that, really. There is a thing\
  \ called exchange, and it is so simple and powerful, and so natural. It can happen\
  \ anywhere if I\u2019m open to it and fortunate to encounter other people willing\
  \ to connect. As an ex-introvert (althought I still am in some ways) that scene\
  \ touched me. Because I was feeling so good, their simple act of waiting for me\
  \ got a new meaning: friendship, partnership, and I felt that happiness comes first,\
  \ and then everything\u2019s alright.\n            We went back to our way home,\
  \ which was our camp that weekend, talking and enjoying the end of the day (soon\
  \ it would become very cold, and we would look for shooting stars wrapped in our\
  \ blankets). I didn\u2019t expect to have such lovely feelings towards people I\
  \ had met so recently. But it wasn\u2019t something so directional, it was about\
  \ finding my balance between my proper way, my timing, and that of the people around\
  \ me. Of feeling good, and then seeing everything good. My authenticity in the way\
  \ of my silly balancing on the rails alone and a silent agreement that I was part\
  \ of a group, as an individual."
