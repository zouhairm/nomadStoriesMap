Text: "Expectation, they say, is the mother of all disappointments. Because here I\
  \ was, in the city of love, where the smell of freshly baked croissants decorated\
  \ the air, yet all I felt was discontent. Paris didn\u2019t take my breath away,\
  \ it instead caused the collapse of a simple childhood dream.\n\nThe streets were\
  \ lined with piles of garbage, simply lying there in the open. Masked against the\
  \ debris with cotton sheets struggling to survive the cold were squatters. They\
  \ huddled around a fire they had made, each opening their palms toward the heat,\
  \ then aggressively rubbing them together as they created their own warmth. This\
  \ was not the Paris I imagined, this was not the Paris I long dreamed of.\n\nIntent\
  \ on making the most of my journey, I woke up the next day filled with optimism\
  \ and excitement. I decided to visit the 984 feet Eiffel Tower, but before I did,\
  \ I wanted to get the perfect picture and the place for this was the Trocadero Gardens.\
  \ This beautiful open space created a picturesque image of the city whilst showcasing\
  \ the beautiful monument, an engineer\u2019s dream. As I ascended the skyline of\
  \ the beautiful Eiffel Tower, the aerial view of the city was almost illusory as\
  \ it showcased the detailed thought and planning given to the urban design. \n\n\
  I decided to also see the masterpieces of the renaissance paintings and sculptures\
  \ at the Louvre Museum, it is here that the famous Mona Lisa is located. Truth be\
  \ told, it\u2019s smaller than I expected and it was hard to catch a good glimpse\
  \ as it was surrounded by  onlookers. Despite \u201Cnot living up to the hype,\u201D\
  \ I was overjoyed to just be photographed with it, so maybe it did. \n\nDuring my\
  \ day out, I was told that several roadways had been blocked by protesters- the\
  \ \u2018Yellow Vest.\u2019 The demonstrations, in its 13th week, was a way to showcase\
  \ citizen\u2019s  disapproval of the government and their plans. There were cases\
  \ where marches ended in violence, but I was fortunate enough to not experience\
  \ such debacle. I was instead inconvenienced by the lack of public transportation\
  \ which saw me walking for over three hours before finally getting to the railway\
  \ station.\n\nAs I stood at the station waiting to purchase my ticket, I felt something\
  \ robbing against my hip, so subconsciously I grabbed it was and realised it was\
  \ a hand. I turned to see two startled blue eyes staring at me. Recognising his\
  \ intention to steal my phone I exclaimed, \u201COh my God,\u201D while he retorted\
  \ in French before running off. I was alone in my astonishment, as pickpockets are\
  \ a dime a dozen in Paris, it was simply just another day.\n\nMy soul is full of\
  \ adventures and doing the daring. So when I heard that popular delicacies in France\
  \ were frog legs and snails I simply had to try. To make the experience even more\
  \ memorable I added oysters as a part of my meal. \n\nThe snails were still in the\
  \ shells and I had a neatly designed fork for the purpose of pulling them out. It\
  \ was quite tasty. If you\u2019ve had conk before it tastes almost just like that.\
  \ The oysters were my favourite, but my Nigerian friends were disgusted at the feeling\
  \ in their mouth before they swallowed. I will say that the frog legs tasted like\
  \ chicken wings, but happened to be bit soggy. You are reminded that it\u2019s not\
  \ chicken with the after taste, as a weird lingering flavour garnishes your palate,\
  \ one that you most likely won\u2019t forget. \n\nWith each experience, I appreciate\
  \ my life more, as things I have taken for granted prove to be gems. I\u2019ve decided\
  \ on my next travelling opportunity, I will go with an open mind, because with that,\
  \ you won\u2019t be disappointed."
