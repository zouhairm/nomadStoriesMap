Text: "\u201CSorry we can\u2019t put you up,\u201D Jim, an old friend, greeted me.\
  \ His wife\u2019s house in Hoi An, a riverside town in Vietnam, had French shutters\
  \ and pots out front growing chilies, okra, and tomatoes. \u201CSome neighbor might\
  \ tip off the police to earn a favor.\u201D\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s police business if\
  \ you have friends stay over?\u201D I laughed, removing my shoes.\n\n\u201CEverything\u2019\
  s police business! Darn Communists, driving around with their iPhones and their\
  \ Mercedes Benzes!\u201D Jim ushered me in to meet his wife, Tien \u2013 they\u2019\
  d met at a Buddhist monastery in Nepal. Their baby daughter, Nguyet, explored the\
  \ house with impunity, scaling two landings of stairs, hands slapping against stone.\
  \ Neither parent batted an eye.\n\nTien was much shorter than me, but moved with\
  \ a purposefulness that made you want to jump out of her way. She marched us out\
  \ of two restaurants, giving the waiters what-for. \u201CThey see two Westerners,\
  \ they try to give us tourist menus,\u201D she scoffed. \u201CNo way!\u201D\n\n\
  Finally, Tien settled on a venue and ordered us a platter of crispy chicken. She\
  \ ate one-handed, breastfeeding Nguyet with the other. When I mentioned that I wrote,\
  \ Tien\u2019s face sparked excitement. \u201CI was a journalist for Saigon\u2019\
  s largest newspaper. Eighteen years, but I quit\u2026 I was too angry. They don\u2019\
  t print anything against the Party.\u201D\n\n\u201CTien won\u2019t be shut up,\u201D\
  \ Jim bragged. \u201CYears ago the government took her father\u2019s land to redistribute.\
  \ Tien represented him in court because no one else would, and she won. Against\
  \ the government. That doesn\u2019t happen here.\u201D\n\n\u201CI like arguing.\u201D\
  \ Tien nibbled a chicken head between her chopsticks. \u201CThe other lawyer resigned\
  \ in disgrace.\u201D\n\nThe next day was sticky-hot, the Thu Bon river an oily green\
  \ where we met. I crouched down to offer Nguyet a toy giraffe (she gravely accepted),\
  \ then Tien took us for cau lau. Local to Hoi An, cau lau consisted of thick, chewy\
  \ noodles and slivered pork in savory broth, topped with deep-fried noodles that\
  \ cracked and crunched between our teeth. Fresh herbs \u2013 mint, coriander, Thai\
  \ basil \u2013 gave the soup a verdant fragrance. Slivered chilies ignited my mouth,\
  \ opening my pores. \n\nIn the marketplace, we ate sweet bean porridge ladled from\
  \ bubbling tureens, alien fruits smashed over shaved ice, chicken kebabs painted\
  \ with plum sauce and rolled up in pancakes. We squeezed onto Jim\u2019s motorbike,\
  \ Nguyet on the handlebars, and drove to an outdoor barbecue where we masticated\
  \ ribs grilled over half an oil drum and threw the bones on the ground.\n\nEverywhere\
  \ strangers cooed over Nguyet and chucked her under the chin. One woman chatted\
  \ with Tien in vowels and diphthongs wholly unfamiliar to me. \u201CShe asks,\u201D\
  \ Tien confided, \u201C\u2018Who\u2019s the foreigner?\u2019 I say you\u2019re Jim\u2019\
  s sister!\u201D We laughed conspiratorially at this, the best joke ever.\n\t\nOn\
  \ my last evening, we sat in a vintage coffeehouse, repainted army green and slapped\
  \ with Communist kitsch. \u201CUncle Ho.\u201D Tien sarcastically saluted a poster\
  \ of Ho Chi Minh. We drank coffee with sweetened condensed milk, and Nguyet mustered\
  \ the daring to touch my arm. \u201CWhy are you shy?\u201D Tien laughed. \u201C\
  Say, \u2018hello, Auntie Anna!\u2019\u201D Mortified, Nguyet buried her face in\
  \ her mother\u2019s collarbone.\n\nDusk fell, and we meandered past luminous fleets\
  \ of paper boats bearing wish-candles downriver, lanterns like hot air balloons\
  \ overhead. Shopkeepers erected altars, laden with candles, bowls of fruit, sweets,\
  \ and fake banknotes. They set the money on fire and dropped it into metal braziers\
  \ on the ground. \n\n\u201CHang ma,\u201D Tien explained, \u201CSpirit money \u2013\
  \ full-moon offerings to ghosts.\u201D I felt a sticky nudge against my finger and\
  \ looked down. Nguyet gazed up at me, unsmiling, and snuck her hand into mine.\n\
  \n\u201CNguyet sleeps with her giraffe,\u201D said Tien. \u201CShe wakes up, first\
  \ thing she says: \u2018Where\u2019s Anna?\u2019\u201D I smiled, rueful \u2013 for\
  \ flying home in the morning, and for home being so far away. If I ever saw Nguyet\
  \ again, she\u2019d be very different, and wouldn\u2019t remember me at all.\n\n\
  The moon\u2019s reflection shivered on the water as hang ma smoke rose to meet the\
  \ ghosts. Down on the ground, we were the opposite of ghosts. Tien took her daughter\u2019\
  s other hand and \u2013 one, two, three! \u2013 we picked her up and swung her like\
  \ a bell."
