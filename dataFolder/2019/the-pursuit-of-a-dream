Text: "On Jun 2017, in S\xE3o Paulo, while serving at church in a normal Sunday, I\
  \ met a swiss guy who was also part of the same church, but in Zurique, as it is\
  \ a global church. We spent the whole day together and got in touch with each other\
  \ for a few months till the day he cut me off. \nYet, I couldn\u2019t take him out\
  \ from my thoughts and neither from my heart. So I planned a travel to Europe with\
  \ a few excuses in order not to reveil anyone that swiss guy was the reason why\
  \ I was crossing the oceans.\nI let him know I was coming, we set the dates together\
  \ and he agreed to show me around at night besides the Sunday we would have together\
  \ at church.\nThe moment I arrived in Zurique, after two hours getting lost, I found\
  \ the Airbnb apartment I had booked. I was arriving from Paris and he was arriving\
  \ from Cape Town as he was on holidays with a couple of friends in South Africa.\
  \ It was a Saturday, but I realized he didn\u2019t want to meet before Sunday at\
  \ church. So I walked around Zurique alone that day and went to bed really early\
  \ as I would have to be at 7:30 am at church.\nSo after getting lost again, I was\
  \ there, before 7:30 am to see him, and when I see him coming from afar I got terryfied\
  \ and could stare to long for him. I \u2018ve been single for a very long time,\
  \ at the time it was about 10 years alone, and I guess I don\u2019t know how to\
  \ act in this sort of circunstance.\nI dont know what happened but he had moments\
  \ he despised me, moments he was a sweetheart, it was defenitly the definition of\
  \ a bittersweet encounter. I had the feeling he panic by having me around.\nI had\
  \ planned to be in Zurique 5 days so we could know each other better. But all I\
  \ really wanted was at least one moment alone with him just to tell him that since\
  \ the day I met him, I could never take him out of my mind. Everyday at the metro,\
  \ walking in the streets, going to bed, or even at church, he was the constant image\
  \ I could think of. But I couldn\u2019t. The other four days in Switzerland he didn\u2019\
  t text or call me at all, even though he had said he would.\nSo I tried to do some\
  \ sightseeing, some turistics stuff as my heart was crushed. While feeling the freezing\
  \ wind at the Rigi-Kulm, I started to wonder with myself how someone could be coulder\
  \ than those winds.\nI spent all nights crying and the days hoping to get over that\
  \ nightmare. And since that day I always pray for a inner Paradise in me as places\
  \ are only places just like love is not found anywhere.\nYet, I don\u2019t regret\
  \ a thing. I like to think how I fought for him and the Peace I feel whenever I\
  \ remender I did everything I could to have that dream come true."
