Text: "Endowed with unrivaled natural beauty and a heavenly climate, picturesque Kashmir\
  \ has often been described as paradise on Earth and \u2018Switzerland of the East\u2019\
  . With so much cultural wealth, archaeological sites, monuments and centuries-old\
  \ wooden and stone architecture, unfortunately Kashmir being at the heart of the\
  \ India-Pakistan conflict has been more mentioned in the global media for the violence,\
  \ deaths and destruction than its unmatched beauty and rich heritage.\nFast-flowing\
  \ streams of fresh water, chirping birds, mighty hills and a cool, gentle breeze\
  \ blowing down from the snow-capped mountains enchant everyone, especially those\
  \ who come for the first time from the hustle and bustle of major cities to experience\
  \ the natural beauty of Kashmir.\n\nAlmost every part of Kashmir, a divided valley\
  \ between India and Pakistan has rivers, streams and lakes with crystal clear water\
  \ which adds its breathtaking natural beauty and sweet-scented surroundings.\n\n\
  I want to write a travel story on Azad Kashmir, the part which is being administered\
  \ by Pakistan. \n\nHere is the brief introduction of the intended story site:\n\n\
  Azad Jammu and Kashmir abbreviated as AJK and commonly known as Azad Kashmir, is\
  \ a nominally self-governing and polity administered by Pakistan. The territory\
  \ lies west of the Indian-administered state of Jammu and Kashmir, and was previously\
  \ part of the former princely state of Jammu and Kashmir.\n\nAzad Kashmir is part\
  \ of the greater Kashmir region, which is the subject of a long-running conflict\
  \ between Pakistan and India. \n\nThe territory shares a border with Gilgit-Baltistan,\
  \ together with which it is referred to by the United Nations and other international\
  \ organizations as \"Pakistan administered Kashmir\".\n\nAzad Kashmir is one-sixth\
  \ of the size of Gilgit-Baltistan.  The territory also borders Pakistan's Punjab\
  \ province to the south and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa province to the west. To the east,\
  \ Azad Kashmir is separated from the state of Jammu and Kashmir by the Line of Control,\
  \ the de facto border between India and Pakistan. \n\nAzad Kashmir has a total area\
  \ of 13,297 square kilometers (5,134 sq mi), and a total population of 4,045,366\
  \ as per the 2017 Census.\n\nThe 2005 earthquake killed 100,000 people and left\
  \ another three million people displaced, with widespread devastation. Since then,\
  \ with help from the Government of Pakistan and foreign donors, reconstruction of\
  \ infrastructure is underway. Azad Kashmir's economy largely depends on agriculture,\
  \ services, tourism, and remittances sent by members of the British Mirpuri community.\
  \ Nearly 87% of the households own farms in Azad Kashmir while the region has a\
  \ literacy rate of approximately 72% and has the highest school enrollment in Pakistan.\n\
  \nThe northern part of Azad Jammu and Kashmir encompasses the lower area of the\
  \ Himalayas, including Jamgarh Peak (4,734 m or 15,531 ft). However, Hari Parbat\
  \ peak in Neelum Valley is the highest peak in the state. Fertile, green, mountainous\
  \ valleys are characteristic of Azad Kashmir's geography, making it one of the most\
  \ beautiful regions of the subcontinent.\n\nThrough my travel story, I will introduce\
  \ Pakistani administered Kashmir to the international tourists. I will provide in-depth\
  \ information to the visitors who will be traveling to the region first time.\n\n\
  It is worth mentioning here that Azad Kashmir is the safest, secure and peaceful\
  \ part in the entire sub-continent with zero percent crime rate, away from the extremist\
  \ elements and always welcoming to the international tourists.\n\nRecently, the\
  \ government of Pakistan has allowed the international tourists to freely move to\
  \ the Kashmir and no additional permission certificate required to them.\n\nAbout\
  \ Me:\n\nI am MPhil student in Mass Communication and writing is my passion. Here\
  \ are few of my published travel pieces.\n\nhttps://www.dawn.com/authors/7425/mubashar-naqvi\
