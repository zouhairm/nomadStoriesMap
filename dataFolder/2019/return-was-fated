Text: "The trip back to Pokhara Nepal began on our return flight from our initial\
  \ visit to Kathmandu and India. A local woman was on the plane and as people do\
  \ started to ask about what we had experienced. She was from Pokhara and her description\
  \ of the lakes area and mountains ensured we came back to see what we had left out.\n\
  \nOur trip to Pokhara, had us seeing the sights but very few mountains as they all\
  \ seemed to be hiding as vague shapes behind a thick cloud mist. The mountains here\
  \ are not as high as those in the true Himalayas but there are 30 peaks ranging\
  \ from 6000 metres to just over 8000 metres in height. The Annapurna Massif is 55\
  \ kilometres long and Pokhara sits on its south face, so the peaks should be visible\
  \ shouldn\u2019t they?\n \nOn one of our hikes through a mountain village we happened\
  \ on a couple who were riding bikes through the area. They had been living in Pokhara\
  \ for some time and knew the climatic conditions well. They had suggested that what\
  \ was really needed to clear the mist and fog was a rain storm. That evening as\
  \ a mass of people from all over the world were experiencing the joy of Holi in\
  \ the streets and restaurants, with colour and water everywhere, that rain storm\
  \ happened. The next morning the curtains opened to reveal, for the first time,\
  \ a clear and uninterrupted view of the Annapurna range. A truly magic sight.\n\n\
  After 4 days of tramping through the countryside surrounding Pokhara our guide suggested\
  \ that because we had finished the itinerary walks early there may be one more hike\
  \ we really should undertake before heading homewards; a really \u2018must see\u2019\
  \ experience. Having hiked for quite a lot of the time and then walking into town\
  \ of a night did we really want to spend our last day hiking again? \nCuriosity\
  \ won the day and the hike was set up for the next morning. We left early and met\
  \ a new guide who bundled us into a car to join the start of the climb up a mountain.\n\
  The climb was quite steep with a meandering path through local villages and farmland,\
  \ with the sun now out it was now very warm. As we gained elevation the vegetation\
  \ changed and the local houses thinned out but continued to meet other walkers on\
  \ the path.\nAs the summit of the climb was getting close there was an enclave of\
  \ small huts and rock houses and on the final incline as the summit was reached\
  \ the mountain we were on plateaued into a vast green meadow with a group of chalets\
  \ built on the edge \u2013 we had reached \u2018Australia Camp\u2019. It is a series\
  \ of chalets/hostels built in the late 60's by different countries around the world\
  \ for their trekkers who flock to this area for the superb views and Annapurna treks.\
  \ The meadow was a vibrant green, looking directly at Machhapuchhre (Fishtail Mountain)\
  \ in all its glory. Snow covered, standing out against a vivid blue sky, it looked\
  \ close enough to touch. The surprise of this was enough but adding to the atmosphere\
  \ and contrasts was there was a big group staying on the plateau that night and\
  \ there were people erecting magenta tents for the group to stay in that night.\
  \ The greens, blues, whites and magenta made for a magic combination of awe and\
  \ majesty. The photos were amazing!\nA chance in timing made it possible to view\
  \ and experience the presence of these extraordinary mountains and have one of the\
  \ best mountain experiences in Nepal."
