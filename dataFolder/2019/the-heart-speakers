Text: "As a curious observer, I have a habit to take notes of everything. Having travelled\
  \ around Hungary, I got a new scribbling pad to catch details for a story which\
  \ wouldn\u2019t leave indifferent any reader.\n\nThe desire to escape from the hustle\
  \ and bustle of Budapest, led me to the island of Margit. \n\nHaving stepped on\
  \ an enchanting land of the island, I felt the mild whiff of a tickling breeze which\
  \ was a sign of a future intimate conversation with a person whose story can stir\
  \ up the diminished colors of our inner world. That sign has always been my personal\
  \ connection with nature. When something enormously exciting is going to happen,\
  \ this playful windflaw circulates all over my body.\n\nSitting on the lawn in the\
  \ middle of a noble park, full of flowering bushes, I was listening to the lulling\
  \ sounds of jolly splashes of water reaching from the fountain. Like a child waiting\
  \ for a candy, I was on the edge of my seat because of that desire to put on a paper\
  \ something really significant. So, having taken the position of a careful gazer,\
  \ I was immediately attracted by a nice old couple resting beside me. On a glance\
  \ they were a common octogenarian people but it was only the first impression.\n\
  \nThe fortune favored me and I became an attentive listener of the story how these\
  \ two loving hearts became one.\n\nA young man, travelling about Rome, found an\
  \ old damp diary in the nook of the ancient monastery. The only understandable written\
  \ thing for him was the name Margit and the old-world postcard of Hungary. Being\
  \ a keen historian he gave these notes to the translators, they discovered that\
  \ the found manuscript was a lost diary of the Hungarian Princess. For him, this\
  \ find, meant a breathtaking expedition in search of the second part of the scripture.\n\
  At the same time in another part of the Europe, a young lady found the extension\
  \ of the lost records. Being a Hungarian, she understood what was written there\
  \ at once. Suddenly she was determined to set out to Budapest to look for the first\
  \ part, feeling that this diary would bring her happiness and that feeling didn\u2019\
  t let her down.\n\nAn initial story begins in the 13th century with the life of\
  \ Princess Margit. Father sent her to the island so that she became a nun. Everyone\
  \ thought she was a lonely girl devoid of love and it was the common fact until\
  \ these two finders revealed the truth about her internal life having read her secret\
  \ thoughts. She had a beloved person who was a helper of her father. She met him\
  \ on the island and could no longer forget. She was a person whose body and soul\
  \ belonged to the Almighty. The poor thing tried so hard to eradicate her feelings,\
  \ but all that was in vain. That diary became the only refuge where her heart could\
  \ burst out everything that she couldn\u2019t say aloud. But that bleeding heart\
  \ left on the pages was taken away by elder nons and spread over the world. Even\
  \ not being able to put down her pain on just a piece of paper, she consequently\
  \ fell ill from anguish and passed away at the age of 29.\n\nComing up to our travellers,\
  \ Budapest met them on the first day of spring, when nature began to wake up and\
  \ bloom. \n\nThey met. Accidently? No. Fatefully.\n\nWhen they saw in their hands\
  \ the extracts from the life of Margit, they realized that all those pages, written\
  \ many centuries ago, miraculously brought them together.\n\nThey got married in\
  \ the miniature church of Saint Michael located in the island. Every year they come\
  \ there to the grave of Margit with words of gratitude and leave her favorite bouquet\
  \ of delicate red daisies. The third part of the diary is still lost but they haven\u2019\
  t been despair in their willingness to make a happy end of Margit's story.\n\nFor\
  \ more than 50 years, the couple has believed Margit carefully guards their love\
  \ from heavens like a pure angel of love.\n\nWho knows how many more love stories\
  \ the mysterious Budapest hides?"
