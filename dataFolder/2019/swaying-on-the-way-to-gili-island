Text: From Kuta we had someone who will pick us from Hotel to Padangbai harbour. It
  was included to the ferry boat service that we booked. it was two hours drive and
  nice road, of course it is Bali. Finally we arrived in the harbour. It was crowded.
  After we arrived, we were not directly take the boat, but we need to re-registered
  again and had to wait for the boat to be ready to sail. 30 minutes later, thwy announced
  that we were ready to sail and all the passenger need to board immediately. We got
  our seat and the boat start to move. It was unexpected because the weather was crazy.
  The air was really strong. the wave was really high. A lot of passanger felt seasick
  even the traveller who sat next to me asked for plastic bag. it felt like we took
  a rollercoaster, jumped in the sea and flew to the sky. I tried to hold every feeling
  in my head and stomach, prayed for everything to be over. Suddenly the engine stopped,
  I though "what?! Something happen?". When I saw out from the window, wow, we were
  arrived. the island is so beautiful. we anchored on the beach. So we needed to go
  down by stairs. Finally we arrived on the island.
