Text: "A traditional Korean (Darye) tea ceremony isn\u2019t usually conducted in sweatpants.\
  \ My host, Jun, however, didn\u2019t seem to be bothered by his lack of propriety\
  \ as he poured a thick stream of water from the cooling bowl into the teapot. \n\
  \n\u2018Nothing makes life simpler than a cup of tea\u2019, he stated, carefully\
  \ arranging the curled-up leaves on the rippling surface of the poured water. Jun\
  \ was a journalist, and an artist. And in the delicate movements of his hands and\
  \ his careful attention to detail, this showed. \n\nDarye tea ceremonies are supposed\
  \ to be held in disciplined silence. So naturally, the television roared in the\
  \ background as Jun poured the tea into our little cups. \n\nTea culture was brought\
  \ to Korea by the Buddhists, I was told. In the old days. The days of the Koryo\
  \ dynasty. \u201CIt is not japanese\u201D, I was sternly reminded. \u201COur tea\
  \ is purely our own.\u201D\n\nSomething on the television suddenly caught Jun\u2019\
  s eye. He turned his head  and \n tilted it towards the screen, trying to catch\
  \ words I presume he missed. \nI craned my neck to examine what had captured his\
  \ attention. It was live footage of a solidarity event in support of reunification.\
  \ \n\nI\u2019d been used to such events by now. Post the historic cross-Korea meeting\
  \ of April 2018, pamphlets, slogans, and whispers of re-unification greeted me everywhere\
  \ from Incheon airport to suburban Goyang where we now sat with our tea. It seemed\
  \ like every middle-aged South Korean had begun to feel an allegiance to their brothers\
  \ in the north. \n\n\u201CDo you believe that re-unification will happen?\u201D\
  \ I asked, while Jun, his attention now back to the tea, gathered the used leaves\
  \ in the teapot and doused them in a fresh dose of water. \n\nHe smiled and nodded\
  \ his head slightly . \u201CI hope\u201D. \n\nAs the leaves infused and darkened\
  \ the water to the same light-earthy color of the cups, my lessons continued. \n\
  \n\u201CA tea ceremony can mean many things\u201D. Jun explained, tilting his head\
  \ and raising his eyebrows in instructive emphasis. The ritualizing of tea drinking,\
  \ the formation of the darye, began after the Korean war. In an attempt to revive\
  \ a way of life that had gotten lost in the region\u2019s bitter struggles with\
  \ Japanese colonialism and internal ideological conflict. \nBuilding a tea ceremony,\
  \ according to Jun,helped rebuild this Korea. \n\n\u201CSometimes we need symbols\
  \ to make us feel like a people\u201D. I nodded in understanding. He poured me the\
  \ second cup. \n\nBut ahead of our sips and the roar of the television an unspoken\
  \ implication sat heavy in the air. 'This' Korea. The tea ceremony rebuilt a Korea\
  \ that was distinctly South. The Korean war left the world with two different Koreas,\
  \ two different rebuildings, and two different regimes.\n\nHaving grown up with\
  \ the India-Pakistan conflict, I know how borders tear people apart and how the\
  \ tantalizing the promise of peace sounds after decades of senseless enmity and\
  \ bloodshed. But unlike tea, politics isn\u2019t simple. With a fundamental difference\
  \ in political ideology between them, would the two nations ever really be able\
  \ to unite? \n\nAs Jun poured the final round, I accepted the cup with a sad smile.\
  \ Perhaps it was alright to hope."
