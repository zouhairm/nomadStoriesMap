Text: "The traces of faded henna painted on my toes reminds me of another home. The\
  \ markings nearly gone, but the memories engrained. The mystery of how it came about\
  \ I\u2019ve stopped trying to solve.\n\nAt the Chavan family farm, Mama along with\
  \ her daughter-in-laws Monali and Nayan, pressed the leaves of the henna plant onto\
  \ the palms of their hands, creating an orange stain. Seeing my intrigue, they decorated\
  \ my finger tips with wrapped-leaves like bandaids. In ten minutes time, I had orange\
  \ caps on my fingers. \n\nThe next night Mama invited a family friend over for Mehendi,\
  \ what we know as henna tattooing. Immediately she got to work on my hands and then\
  \ my feet. She created the most intricate designs as if she were tracing lines already\
  \ beneath my skin.\n\nNot realizing how long it would take for the henna to dry,\
  \ Mama saw I was having trouble sitting still. \u201CAre you hungry?\u201D She asked.\
  \ \u201CYes,\u201D I said.\n\nShe spoon-fed me mango puree and (knowing I was wheat-free)\
  \ home-made rice roti with her right hand. I couldn\u2019t remember the last time\
  \ I\u2019d been fed more than a bite or two of food by anyone. \n\nI imagine that\
  \ in most homes you\u2019d have to wait to eat something. Or perhaps you\u2019d\
  \ be given a bite of something to tide you over. But this home was different. This\
  \ was Mama Chavan\u2019s home. It\u2019s foundation, walls and rooftop were plastered\
  \ with love. And it became my home, too. \n\nDespite my stand-out white skin and\
  \ blonde hair, I somehow fit in. Although Mama welcomes every living creature with\
  \ love, she took me in as her daughter. When I was hurt, both Mama and Papa Chavan\
  \ drove me to the orthopedic doctor. In my recovery, Mama and the women looked after\
  \ my every need. When my face was dry, Mama joyously gave me an aloe vera facial.\n\
  \nAs the henna was drying, I was overjoyed with the results, expressing my desire\
  \ to have a henna artist at my wedding one day. \u201CI\u2019ll take a class,\u201D\
  \ Mama Chavan said, \u201CI will do for you.\u201D"
