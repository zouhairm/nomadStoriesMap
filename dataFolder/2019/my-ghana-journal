Text: "It's March 4, 2018 I'm getting on the plane for my missinary trip to Ghana\
  \ a nation on West Africa's Gulf of Guinea. I don't know a lot about this country\
  \ but what the USA school books taught me and all the sad stories I see on television.\
  \ I'm doing this for me and the great unknown for us Black Americans. I hear I will\
  \ come back a whole new person and have better understanding of my biblical beliefs.\
  \ \n\nMarch 6. I've arrived here in Africa and it is beautiful and muddy. I've seen\
  \ the what the resort life has to offer me and now it's time to take on my missionary\
  \ work outside of the resort.  I was told to stay with my group and pay attention\
  \ because I attracted attention with my American look; I had to get out of my native\
  \ vacation closes. As the group stopped at a local food joint, I couldn't but ponder\
  \ on my clothing. There was a shop with more island clothes. A kinda older women\
  \ and her sister helped me get a Kente with bold colors and circles on it. I ditched\
  \ my purse and put everything in my pockets, they said it helped dodge muggers and\
  \ criminals looking for tourist. The women were kinda they took my purse as payment\
  \ and I was grateful. \n\nMarch 7. I did it I manage to fit in or blend in with\
  \ the people in Ghana and I felt as if the other resort guest starring at me and\
  \ chatting me up in their conversation. I needed to see more and step out only,\
  \ although I've been told it's not safe. I look just like the people here, crunchy\
  \ hair, deep darkskin and big lips. Everyone was live everything was live; there\
  \ was so many people walking on the street well not really street but dirt roads\
  \ and I thought I was gonna see wild animals and trees everywhere but that is the\
  \ opposite of what American showed me. The was a lot of buildings not so tall but\
  \ shops and food markets it was exciting to be out. I found myself miles away from\
  \ the resort when night fall was approaching. I felt as if I was being followed\
  \ but the crowd behind me was very loud, grabbing me by the hand a woman walks next\
  \ to me. I was beyond nervous but she assured me the local teens are always up to\
  \ no good. We walked back to her home; it was a pretty big hut. This waste just\
  \ a hut it was not made of mud and sticks like I thought. Her family was nice and\
  \ they children kept giving me gifts for me to wear that they've made. I stayed\
  \ for dinner because the woman insisted no one would leave her home without a full\
  \ belly. I felt as if I was at home with my parents arms wide open. \n\nMarch 9.\
  \ My trip is almost over and I've spent more time in my new familys community then\
  \ with my group at the resort. I've came to learn sounds and how to play instruments\
  \ such as the Mbira and the talking drum. These people aren't sadly struggling they're\
  \ lives seem more peaceful than back home. I couldn't have learned about how music\
  \ brings everyone in the community out of their homes in one area; back in the States\
  \ that would cost for a live concert. Food is given to the neighbors children, everyone\
  \ is sisters and brothers in the community. I love this feeling to see people together.\n\
  \nMarch 10. It's time for me to leave and I'm given a sort of going away parade\
  \ in honor of my home going. Everyone insisted when I return I must not stay in\
  \ a hotel I must come and stay with them in their homes. I felt the love of everyone\
  \ so fast just by holding a stranger's hand at night. Going back to the States is\
  \ sad for me I love these people and there homes.  \n\nThe end of my journal. Till\
  \ my next adventure."
