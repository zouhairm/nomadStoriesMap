Text: "The French Dream\n\nIn 2008, there I was arriving in Europe, the old continent.\
  \ I first went to Italy to apply for my Italian citizenship, which I happily did\
  \ in a charming little town near Venetia.\n\nWhen I got all my European documents\
  \ I felt this freedom combined with a thirst of traveling and exploring different\
  \ countries.\n\nThat\u2019s when Barcelona came to mind, because of its well-known\
  \ fun atmosphere. I loved it so much that I end up living there for a whole year!\
  \ \nWhat a wonderful place to be, especially when you are on your early twenties\
  \ as I was. Beaches, parties, sun, beautiful people, history, art, culture, culinary,\
  \ all combined with this incredible multicultural happy vibes. What an experience!\n\
  \nI\u2019m from Brazil, I finished my High School in United States, and after being\
  \ in Italy and Spain, I was ready to proceed with my search for\nmore world adventure.\
  \ That\u2019s when Paris comes along.\n\nI studied Fashion Design, so when I found\
  \ a job opportunity in Paris (the capital of fashion) in this beautiful five stars\
  \ hotel near the Arc de Triomphe, I went for it with all my energy. After all Paris\
  \ is\nalways a good idea!\n\nI moved from Barcelona to Paris not knowing anyone\
  \ there and not knowing a word of French. All I had was a good job and many dreams\
  \ in\nmy young mind of this beautiful \u201CFrench dream\u201D which was so charming\
  \ and of course \u201Cso chic\u201D.\n\nMy first day of work was one of a kind,\
  \ which I will never forget. I had to start at 6:30AM for the Hotel opening. But\
  \ the thing was, I lived in small town near Versailles, which is one hour from Paris.\
  \ So\nI woke up very early in the morning (or in the middle of the night) to catch\
  \ up the five o\u2019clock train to Paris.\n\nGetting at the train station, it was\
  \ still dark with no one around. I clearly see that there was something wrong. All\
  \ the TV panels that display the train\u2019s arrivals and departures were not working\
  \ properly.\nThere was no UBER back then, so I was about to miss my first day of\
  \ work, which was very embarrassing. My boss trusted me so much for this job opportunity,\
  \ and not showing up on my first day of work was just terrible, and maybe even the\
  \ end of my work contract.\n\nWhile I was starting to panic about it, I saw very\
  \ fare away a police car passing by. I waved to them showing that I wanted to ask\
  \ something. They stopped and came out of the car. The communication was very hard\
  \ because they speak very little English. With mimics they realized that I was going\
  \ to miss my train because it was not working, so they invited me to go to the nearest\
  \ train station in Versailles to catch my train.\n\nNow picture this, there I was,\
  \ getting in this police car with these police mans all dressed up in uniforms,\
  \ with the red lights on, as if they were in a important mission. It really felt\
  \ like a movie scenario!\n\nWhat it could be a disaster, ended up being the most\
  \ memorable first day of work ever! \nThanks to the kind help of these police mans,\
  \ I was able to go to the next train station, and arrive in time to my first day\
  \ of work in this beautiful hotel in the heart of Paris.\n\nWhat an adventure! And\
  \ guess what? I\u2019m ready for lots more adventure around the world! \n\nTraveling\
  \ to different cultures has always been my passion, and I really want to make a\
  \ living out of this passion. Looking forward to hearing from you to make it happen\
  \ together! \n\nWith my kindest regards,\n\nCLARA VARGAS"
