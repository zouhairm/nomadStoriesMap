Text: "It was my first time in Italy, it was 2014.\nMy father and family live there,\
  \ I live with my mother in Guatemala instead.\n\nI didn't plan anything, I let my\
  \ family surprise me with some local beauty. I am much more atracted to roadtrips\
  \ and adventures than making a cosmopolitan visit. In fact, I love escaping from\
  \ reallity.\nWe made a roadtrip to Umbria, one of the 20 italian regions, where\
  \ my family came from, actually. \nIt was spring almost begining summer.\nWe entered\
  \ into a valley surrounded by wildflowers. I saw some women laying over the valley,\
  \ waiting for the sun to kiss their skin, and some people were eating on one side\
  \ of the road. \nWe got off the car and it felt a little chilly, pure fresh air\
  \ invaded my lungs and my eyes were amazed with the landscame in front of me. \n\
  We were at Castelluccio di Norcia. \nI've never felt so connected with nature as\
  \ that spring. I've never loved the wildflowers as I felt inlove that day. And that\
  \ trip opened my eyes and let me found my true self been surrounded by montains,\
  \ by nature, by beauty; letting me reconnect with all the noble forces of life.\n\
  \nCastelluccio will always be one of my favorites places on earth, because of the\
  \ breath that took me away and the way it fulfill me with love instead."
