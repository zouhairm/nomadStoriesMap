Text: "I was so enraptured by the moment I didn\u2019t mind having to see the bare\
  \ chest of that old woman bounce while the four of us danced around the fire. We\
  \ hopped in circles under the stars while I loudly strummed my guitar; I couldn\u2019\
  t shake off this visceral, almost tribal, soporific glee that took over me that\
  \ summer night at the cusp of Florida\u2019s Key West.\n\nWhat I did not expect\
  \ to discover, soon afterward, was that the lovely, unusual couple I had met and\
  \ spent those mesmerizing moments with, had split up. Gladly, I had nothing to do\
  \ with the divorce\u2014I might have delayed it a tad further for all I know.\n\n\
  I'll rewind.\n\nMy friend and I were doing our dreamed coast-to-coast road-trip.\
  \ It was a 4-hour drive there from Miami, where we\u2019d been before. We left the\
  \ city\u2019s concrete walls and symmetrically arrayed palm trees for a road swallowed\
  \ by naturally crooked green and scarcer residencies. Bridge after bridge, the sky\
  \ seemed to blend with the turquoise water, getting larger, larger, and any two\
  \ seconds staring out the window made you feel that sky and sea were one\u2014we\
  \ were just a dot, following a thin verdant line inside an infinite bubble blue.\n\
  \nWe arrived at our campsite, set up our paraphernalia, and I took out my guitar\
  \ for a little jam. As we finished playing More Than Words, by Extreme, we hear\
  \ a \u201CWow\u201D coming from the neighboring campers.\n\nThe shallow voice belonged\
  \ to this older woman, bearing many of the reminiscing articles a former hippie\
  \ would\u2019ve. She sat embraced on a much younger man\u2019s lap whose long hair\
  \ and brawny frame suggested a rather contrasting background from his date.\n\n\
  Her \u201Cthank you guys,\u201D sounded heavy and sincere. \u201CWe\u2019ve been\
  \ through a rough patch in our relationship recently,\u201D she continued. \u201C\
  That song just took everything away for a moment.\u201D\n\nDespite the precocious\
  \ personal sharing, she struck me as so heartfelt and honest I felt more touched\
  \ than violated.\n\n\u201CWell, hi.\u201D I managed to say.  \u201CIt\u2019s our\
  \ pleasure. You two been together long?\u201D\n\nThey had, and not only that same\
  \ song had played on their wedding, but they\u2019d also been coming to that same\
  \ campground for the past 4 years for their anniversary, on that same date.\n\n\
  Had serendipity not been enough to make the occasion memorable, I had only to turn\
  \ my head sideways and watch seagulls lazily waft against Key West\u2019s postcard\
  \ sunset.\n\nWe shared meals and stories. Carrie was a nurse and lived a couple\
  \ of towns away. Also, she\u2019d actually been a hippie. Max was an eccentric artist\
  \ from Mexico and told me readily how he felt that all living creatures are as one,\
  \ connected through this indescribable timeless energy \u2014 '...perhaps the same\
  \ force that placed the four of us here, tonight.'\n\nThe firewood cracked next\
  \ to us. Flames shone against Max\u2019s serious face and long hair making him look\
  \ like a Native impersonated, ancient and wise, schooling me on humanity.\n\nChat\
  \ turned to laughter, evening into night, and we started dancing when I took the\
  \ guitar out again. I had been warned about the liberty of garments people took\
  \ down in The Keys, though I didn\u2019t expect it would really happen. It did,\
  \ but it felt natural. I had yearned for uniqueness, suppose I found it: me, a Brazilian,\
  \ my Ukrainian mate, a flowery Floridian, and her Mexican chief: all bare-chested\
  \ cavorting in the moonlight.\n\nWe left early the next day. The mid-summer sun\
  \ wasn\u2019t hospitable inside the tent. Our neighbors looked a lot less mystifying\
  \ that morning, perhaps less alike an alien tribe, more like friends.\n\nAlas, a\
  \ few weeks later I found out through Facebook they were splitting the sheets. It\
  \ saddened me greatly that civilization had caught up with them free-spirited ones\u2014\
  \u2014I suppose some things aren\u2019t made to last. I\u2019d felt kin to them\
  \ in just one night, and the road had taught me to let go. They\u2019d had years\
  \ of each other; they too would get through it.\n\nGiven what Max told me, they\
  \ were connected nevertheless. And even though sometimes we feel naked against the\
  \ world, today I find it easier to feel we're with it instead."
