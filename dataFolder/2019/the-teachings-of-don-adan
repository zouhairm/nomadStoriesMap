Text: "\u201CYou\u2019re sweating already?\u201D Don Ad\xE1n asked.\nWe had only been\
  \ on the steep, red clay trail to his coffee field, and my shirt was already soaked.\n\
  \u201CDon\u2019t worry,\u201D I wheezed, \u201CI feel fine.\u201D\nAs I said this,\
  \ I slipped and fell on my ass.\n\nLESSON #1: THESE TRAILS ARE NEARLY VERTICAL.\n\
  \n\u201CCareful,\u201D Don Ad\xE1n said. \u201CYou\u2019re going to have a hard\
  \ time working, if you\u2019re already tired.\u201D\nMy host was well over 60, but\
  \ he had no trouble navigating the steep mountain trail. I had come to the coffee-farming\
  \ town of San Juan Coatz\xF3spam, in the mountainous highlands of Oaxaca, Mexico,\
  \ in search of ancient magic and mystery. It was the summer of 2006, I had just\
  \ read \u201CThe Teachings of Don Juan,\u201D and I was ready for my own personal\
  \ Carlos Castaneda experience. Before I learned shamanism, though, I needed a more\
  \ basic lesson: how to survive. How to farm coffee.\nWe hiked straight downhill\
  \ for more than an hour. As the morning sun shone brighter, the fluffy, white clouds\
  \ slowly rose up from the valley far below, caressing our skin and rising higher\
  \ into the mountains. Twittering birds filled the ancient trees with an elaborate\
  \ song that descended down the musical scale. The lower we descended on our hike,\
  \ the more humid and tropical the landscape became: massive, waving fronds of banana\
  \ plants; wasp nests; giant spiders crouched in their webs. \nFinally, Don Ad\xE1\
  n stopped and hung the yellow plastic water jug on a tree branch. \n\u201CWell,\u201D\
  \ he said, \u201Chere\u2019s the coffee field.\u201D\nThe term \u201Cfield\u201D\
  \ was a bit of a misnomer: the shoulder-high plants grew right out of the steep\
  \ side of the mountain. I looked down at the razor-sharp machete in my hand and\
  \ wondered how I would keep from falling on it.\n\nLESSON #2: DON\u2019T IMPALE\
  \ YOURSELF WHEN YOU\u2019RE FARMING COFFEE.\n\n\u201CSo what\u2019s our job today?\u201D\
  \ I asked Don Ad\xE1n.\n\u201CWe need to clear the underbrush. If we don\u2019t,\
  \ the other plants will choke out the coffee, and it won\u2019t grow.\u201D\n\u201C\
  Got it.\u201D\nI watched my host work. He slashed at the underbrush close to the\
  \ ground, pulling the cuttings into big piles with one foot. I imitated him. After\
  \ two minutes, he scolded me.\n\u201CDon\u2019t cut down the coffee plants! Just\
  \ the weeds.\u201D\n\u201CSorry,\u201D I said. \u201CI\u2019ll be more careful.\u201D\
  \n\nLESSON #3: WHEN FARMING COFFEE, TRY NOT TO CHOP DOWN THE COFFEE PLANTS. \n\n\
  After an hour of work, I was panting. Don Ad\xE1n gestured toward the yellow plastic\
  \ jug. \n\u201CHave a drink if you want,\u201D he said. \u201CYou sure do sweat\
  \ a lot.\u201D\nI greedily guzzled from the jug, pouring half of it down the front\
  \ of my shirt. As I screwed the cap back on, I leaned against a tree and stared\
  \ at the valley below. The early morning clouds had burned away, and I could see\
  \ for miles, all the way down to the tropical lowlands. The river shimmered in the\
  \ distance, snaking through the valley. \n\u201CWould you like some water too, Don\
  \ Ad\xE1n?\u201D\n\u201CNo thanks. Lots of work to do still.\u201D He hadn\u2019\
  t even broken a sweat.\nWe kept slashing. My throat went bone dry and my lower back\
  \ ached. After another hour, my thighs burned. Two hours, and I couldn\u2019t feel\
  \ most of my body anymore. Three hours, and I was begging God to throw me off the\
  \ face of the mountain and give me a merciful death. \nGod did not answer my prayers.\
  \ We kept working. Don Ad\xE1n showed no sign of tiring. While I took longer and\
  \ longer water breaks, he kept chopping nonstop. \nThe sun seemed to hang directly\
  \ overhead forever, never getting any closer to the Western horizon. I started to\
  \ wonder if this mountain was like the hotel in \u201CThe Shining\u201D: Maybe we\
  \ were lost souls, condemned to spend all eternity up there. Finally, miraculously,\
  \ Don Ad\xE1n said we had done enough. \n\u201CLet\u2019s head back up to town.\u201D\
  \nA ragged sigh of relief rattled out of my pitiful lungs. I sheathed my machete,\
  \ grabbed the yellow jug, and followed him up the muddy trail.\n\nLESSON #4: FARMING\
  \ COFFEE IS HARD WORK... AND DON AD\xC1N IS A BADASS."
