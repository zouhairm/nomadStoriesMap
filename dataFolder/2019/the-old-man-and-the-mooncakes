Text: "Hsinchu was the kind of concrete, neon-splattered city where modernity was\
  \ in a hurry to establish itself. It was also the kind of place where children still\
  \ tugged at their parents\u2019 sleeves to point out the w\xE0igu\xF3 r\xE9n (foreigner)\
  \ across the road. \n\nI\u2019d just moved to the Taiwanese city to teach English.\
  \ Directed by my new address in poorly-scrawled Chinese characters, the taxi pulled\
  \ up at the corner of a noisy intersection trapped in the shade of towering apartment\
  \ blocks. The buildings looked as if they\u2019d been folded inside-out, grime-covered\
  \ tiles coating their facades. The driver pointed towards a grey monolith that was\
  \ fringed at the bottom with plump, brined ducks hanging out to dry.  \n\nI made\
  \ my way towards the side gate where, on the boundary, an antique man was perched\
  \ on a stool. His hands were clasped over his walking stick, his face shaded under\
  \ a dusty peaked cap. Long, white hairs fountained out of a mole on his cheek. Intent\
  \ on making some ties in my new home, I gave a broad smile and my best attempt at\
  \ a greeting, but this was met with a blank stare. He could have been carved out\
  \ of stone, but his eyes moved as they followed me suspiciously over the threshold.\
  \ I decided, then, that it was my mission to make the old man my friend.\n\nIn the\
  \ following months, I crossed his station at the gate each time I came or went.\
  \ I\u2019d lift my helmet\u2019s visor to nod and smile as my bike clattered over\
  \ the gate-rail. I\u2019d offer greetings as I pumped drinking water into giant\
  \ cartons which I\u2019d have to lug up five flights of stairs. In return, all I\
  \ got was a disdainful stare. \n\nIn the steaming summer months, he melted into\
  \ the shade of our building, sometimes scratching through the garbage in search\
  \ of discarded treasure, sometimes shifting the legion of parked motorbikes into\
  \ more regimented lines. I tried bringing him bags of fruit from the market, or\
  \ sticky steamed dumplings from the corner shop, but he\u2019d always point them\
  \ away from him, to a spot near the garbage bins. The rejections wore away at me\
  \ until, one day, I finally felt defeated. Fine, I thought. You win. \n\nWhen the\
  \ monsoon season started, fat drops of rain sizzled on the tarmac before the assault\
  \ began in earnest, when sheets of rain formed torrents down the edges of the streets.\
  \ The drops snatched at the heady smells that usually lay over the city, pulling\
  \ exhaust fumes and the thick, sweet-and-sour scent of decomposing food into the\
  \ drains. I would watch the old man scowl from under the eaves of the little gate-house\
  \ roof, the bottoms of his pants stained dark by the rain. \n\nWhen a typhoon lurched\
  \ through the city, the winds screamed through the spaces between the high-rises\
  \ and swept motorbikes onto their sides, dragging them down the street. I watched\
  \ the frenzied choreography from the fifth floor and wondered where the man would\
  \ be. \n\nDuring the Mid-Autumn festival, neighbours I\u2019d never met knocked\
  \ at my door, bringing me decorated boxes filled with sugary mooncakes. I invited\
  \ them inside for tea and finally had the chance to ask someone about the old man\
  \ at the gate \u2013 did they know who he was? Could he speak? Why did he always\
  \ seem so angry?  \n\nThey told me he\u2019d been a Chinese soldier, one of many\
  \ young men sent over from the mainland after World War II. He\u2019d expected a\
  \ brief posting, to be brought back home after the Japanese surrender, but he'd\
  \ been abandoned here, stranded on this island ever since. In those earlier decades,\
  \ the locals had only contempt for the foreign occupiers, and now \u2013 well, he\
  \ had no trade, no money. He'd only ever been a soldier. There was no place for\
  \ him here. \n\nBarricaded from his homeland by the gaping sea, and locked out of\
  \ the community around him, he\u2019d become something of an island himself. \n\n\
  When I next descended the stairs, I took the mooncakes with me. I nodded to him,\
  \ more deeply this time, and obediently put them in their designated spot near the\
  \ garbage bins."
