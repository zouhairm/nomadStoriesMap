Text: "I was born in Venezuela, and then I moved to Colombia, but since five months\
  \ ago I decided to move to Argentina, Buenos Aires to be specific. The thing that\
  \ drove me here was these rumors about being a piece of Europe in South America,\
  \ about the richest culture of tango and that the wine and the men were quite...\
  \ attractive. And they were right, actually, the architecture resembles Madrid,\
  \ sometimes if you just look up (be careful where you do this) you can place your\
  \ mind in La Gran V\xEDa in Madrid, just plug your ears for a bit so the accent\
  \ doesn't let you remember where you are.\nAbout the tango, well, I think this is\
  \ the only place where there is a culture of this dance, of this rhythm, this is\
  \ very rich if you think about it, to go to a place that is unique in something,\
  \ that even is a lifestyle, cause you have to feel the tango, the lyrics can speak\
  \ to you in many ways, is not only the bandoneon, it's the looks, it's the passion,\
  \ it is a MUST you can experience. And there is, of course, the men... you might\
  \ think there is a pleasant mixture of handsomeness and expressionism, well you\
  \ have Argentinian men. They can be very attractive and receptiveness to foreigners,\
  \ its a culture very well adjusted to be in contact with different kind of people\
  \ all the time, and they can also be very social, they like to go out, to be in\
  \ contact with others and value a LOT what it really means to share things, stories,\
  \ time, hobbies... that an awesome characteristic they really do have and I was\
  \ amazed by this, and truth be told, I'm not so social, I'm not that kind of relax\
  \ guy that does different things and that goes with the flow, but Argentina seems\
  \ to be changing that, seems to making me more spontaneous, to re-set some things\
  \ I used to do different, to be less robot when schedules are done... and I'm going\
  \ to bed reaaaally late, life here is for people who love the nightlife. Definitely\
  \ a huge yes if you enjoy being awake at 4 am like if it is 3 pm in the afternoon...\
  \ Amazed is a weird word, I never thought I could be enjoying so much of changing\
  \ myself, my way of reacting, my hour to go to bed... yeap, Amazed, in here, can\
  \ be a very weird word because it stops being what I thought it was, and now what\
  \ amazes me is something really different."
