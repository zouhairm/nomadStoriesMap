Text: "By Brooklyn Connolly\n\nFeathers poke out from books, Chinese art scatters\
  \ the walls and plants flood the floor of Shahab Rowshan\u2019s apartment, where\
  \ he\u2019s lived since 1997. He offers me a pair of slippers as he mops the floors,\
  \ and I wonder what led him here. \n\n\u201CI\u2019m married \u2013\u2013 but I\
  \ didn\u2019t know!\u201D \n\nRowshan continues on to tell me that he left for Iran\
  \ in 2014 to renew his passport, in doing so, the paperwork came back stating that\
  \ his marital status was, indeed, married. Without the time or patience, he left\
  \ a married man.\n\n\u201CSo, my wife doesn\u2019t clean, I have to do it all myself!\u201D\
  \ He gently laughs to himself, while water splashes off of the mop, and onto the\
  \ floor. \n\nI first met Rowshan at the Neighbourhood Witch General Store, a shared\
  \ smile turned into almost an hour of conversation, and left me with many questions.\
  \ \n\nHe identifies by a Muslim, by choice, explaining that in his earlier years\
  \ he didn\u2019t follow the religion so closely. \n\nIt was then that he delved\
  \ into his deep, Wiccan roots. \n\nIn 1985, Rowshan\u2019s sister realized that\
  \ she can read Turkish coffee grinds, thinking that runs in families, he gave it\
  \ a shot. The coffee grinds didn\u2019t end up being more than that, but on a whim,\
  \ he read his roommates palm with such ease, it was as though he was reading words\
  \ from a book.\n\nAt this time in his life, he was studying psychology with a minor\
  \ in mathematics. Reconciling that with his wiccan traits, he began specializing\
  \ in psycho-neuro-biology; a beat that can be used to justify magic spells, scientifically.\n\
  \n\u201CThat\u2019s basically where I am with it scientifically, spiritually is\
  \ a bit more complicated,\u201D he explained. \n\nIn 1994, Rowshan took a class\
  \ on jewelry making. He made his first piece, a silver ring, in under 30 minutes,\
  \ while his class-mates took almost 2 hours. \n\nWith that silver ring, still snug\
  \ around his left pinky finger, Rowshan continued on, telling me about his encounter\
  \ with a past-lives channeler.\n\n\u201C[she said] \u2018you were a jeweller, you\
  \ lived in England, some of the pieces of jewellery that you have made are in the\
  \ British Royal Museum and are still around.\u2019\u201D\n\n25 years later, and\
  \ Rowshan works in the record department of the hospital. Although, his business\
  \ card cites him as a jeweller. \n\nIt wasn\u2019t until I visited his apartment\
  \ and saw his office that I realized, past, present and future, Rowshan continues\
  \ to make jewellery.\n\nInterestingly enough, the channeler continued to tell Rowshan\
  \ that in a past life he was a Buddhist monk, living in solitude for years.\n\n\
  He didn\u2019t think much of that, until attending a lecture at Rebecca Cohen in\
  \ 1997. The lecture was presented by a Buddhist monk, who travelling all the way\
  \ from Tibet to share his knowledge.\n\nWithout really thinking, Rowshan stretched\
  \ his pinky finger, ring intact, out to the monk. Years later, Rowshan read that\
  \ accomplished Buddhist monks make a silver ring, place it on their left pinky,\
  \ for when they become enlightened.   \n\nThat was enough proof for Rowshan to fully\
  \ believe in reincarnation. \n\n\u201CFor me, that was a 15-year process to actually\
  \ have proof,\u201D he explained.\n\nThis is when he began to connect his beliefs,\
  \ experiences and culture to his religion.\n\n\u201CI\u2019m a believer, I\u2019\
  m a Muslim. But, the religion doesn\u2019t really say there\u2019s no such thing\
  \ as reincarnation\u2013\u2013 the church does, the mosques do, the synagogues do,\
  \ but not the books.\u201D \n\nIt is not uncommon to believe in multiple religions.\
  \ In fact, in the mid-century it was very common. Early hieroglyphics prove that\
  \ Egyptians prayed to many gods, similar to paganism today. \n\nNone of this has\
  \ stopped Rowshan. Dancing to the beat of his own drum, he carries on, a complete\
  \ contradiction.  \n\nAs the clock slowly passed 5:23pm, Friday\u2019s 5th Muslim\
  \ prayer time, Rowshan looked up from the cleaned floors and whispered, \u201Cwhat\
  \ the fuck do I know,\u201D with a gentle laugh. \n\nThough he forgot to pray, there\u2019\
  s one thing that can be learned from Rowshan; following your heart, contradictory\
  \ or not, will lead you to enlightenment, bliss, or as Rowshan likes to say, \u2018\
  what have you.\u2019"
