Text: "I sat down onto the wooden sun lounger with a thud and wondered if the weathered\
  \ planks would hold. My soul was leaden, as if attached to an anchor thrown overboard\
  \ into the Gulf of Thailand. The same body of water which now stretched out before\
  \ me. Images from the Choeung Ek Genocidal Centre still lingered on my conscious,\
  \ just like the fragments of clothing fabric that still lingered in the ground,\
  \ occasionally writhing out of the mass grave pits, some 40 years later. \n\nI\u2019\
  d been in Cambodia for a week and the sorrow of the past was apparent in every forced\
  \ smile and greeting.  The sadness was oppressive. I needed to escape. I needed\
  \ isolation.\n\nThat\u2019s how I found myself now on Ortes Beach 2, the furthest\
  \ beach away from the hedonistic, twenty-something backpacker destination of Sihanoukville.\
  \ Before me gentle waves lapped at the fine white sand. I was the sole occupant\
  \ lounging under all the greyed palm treed umbrellas. I couldn\u2019t be happier.\n\
  \nMy peace was short lived.  \n\nJust as I opened my book, a young boy sat down\
  \ next to me. He had coal black hair and coffee coloured skin. He wore a pair of\
  \ pocketed jean shorts cut off at the knees. His malnourished arms dangled like\
  \ limp spaghetti from his bare chest. He started intently at me and smiled. I pretended\
  \ to read my book, but each time I glanced over, he was still there smiling, staring,\
  \ not saying a word.\n\nEventually, my protective outer layer melted.  I picked\
  \ up a stick and wrote my name in the sand. With gusto, the boy grabbed the stick\
  \ from me and carved out the letters \nD A M. We shook hands. \u2018Nice to meet\
  \ you!\u2019 I said, even though I know he didn\u2019t understand the words. I pointed\
  \ to the water and gesticulated with my arms: \u2018Do you want to swim?\u2019 Silently,\
  \ he wrapped his arms around his bare chest and shivered saying: \u2018No!The water\
  \ is freezing!\u2019 \n\nHe then put his fingers to his mouth and said, \u2018Khnhom\u200B\
  \ Nhoam.\u2019  Even without knowing that the words meant \u2018I Eat\u2019 in Khmer,\
  \ his actions were unmistakeable. Reluctantly, I offered him a banana.  He snatched\
  \ it out of my hand and began eating it ravenously. We sat in silence for several\
  \ minutes after he finished eating, before Dam got up, waved goodbye, and ran barefoot\
  \ across the field. I watched until he was out of sight.\n\nThe next morning, I\
  \ resumed my position on the dilapidated sun lounger. Like the day before, I had\
  \ only read about a page of my book before I felt a tap on my shoulder.  I swivelled\
  \ my head around to find Dam standing there, looking identical to the day before.\
  \  With a big smile I waved \u2018Hello.\u2019  He smiled an even bigger smile,\
  \ stretched out his thin arm and uncurled his fingers slowly.  Nestled in his palm\
  \ were some roasted crickets, a delicacy of the region.  I knew instantly that it\
  \ was an offer of friendship.\n\nWith the sun blazing down, we agreed to go for\
  \ a swim. Bored with that, we built sandcastles using discarded toothbrushes to\
  \ replicate flagpoles. Creation complete, I decided to rent a kayak. We paddled.\
  \ We capsized. We caught a crab.  We dodged a black jellyfish.  We laughed until\
  \ our sides ached.\n\nAfter the hour kayak rental was up, we headed to the beach\
  \ side bar for a rest. I settled into the wicker bar stools and ordered a draft\
  \ Angkor served up in an ice cold pint glass. Dam again pinched his fingers together\
  \ and brought them to his mouth saying \u2018Khnhom\u200B Nhoam.\u2019  The resident\
  \ chef to take his order. He settled on rice and chicken and a bottle of coke.\n\
  \nBefore long, the azul sky turned to wisps of pink, orange and purple.  I bide\
  \ farewell to Dam and went back to my lounger to try once again to read. This time,\
  \ as I floated down on to the white wooden sun lounger, my heart full and as light\
  \ as a balloon."
