Text: "The ancient world vs the modern world. And there\xB4s the new list. I haven\xB4\
  t seen them all. But I\xB4ve seen a lot of wonders that totally impressed me during\
  \ my trips around the world. Here\xB4s my 7 wonders of the world. \n \n1. THE RUINS\
  \ OF ANGKOR WAT, CAMBODIA\nWhen seeing the sun rises over the great temple. It\xB4\
  s hard to explain the feeling. It need to be experienced! The amazing feeling tone\
  \ down a bit when seeing a thousands selfie sticks up in the air. But except that.\
  \ STUNNING. The temple city of Angkor is so big it\xB4s hard to understand, you\xB4\
  ll need at least 2 days to even try to explore it all. The ones I found most interesting\
  \ was Bayon - with the four faces of Buddha, Ta Prohm, where Tomb Raider was recorded\
  \ and the main Temple, Angkor Wat. To get a grip how big it really is - enjoy the\
  \ view from a hot air balloon. \n \n2. THE HIGH UP MONASTERIES IN METEORA, GREECE\n\
  The landscape. WOW. 400 meter high rock formations. I can\xB4t stop wonder how someone\
  \ came up with the idea to built monasteries on top of them. That\xB4s what I call\
  \ a wonder. In the beginning there where 20 monasteries now there\xB4s only 6 left.\
  \ Meteora is listed on UNESCO World Heritage Site - I think it should be listed\
  \ as one of the seven wonders. \n \n3. JUNGLE ADVENTURE IN TIKAL, GUATEMALA \nI\
  \ love a good jungle adventure. And I love that they kept so many of the ruins still\
  \ hidden under the vegetation. It really is a place where you can explore for hours,\
  \ days even. The coolest part is that you still can climb up top of some of the\
  \ temple. But I guess it won\xB4t take long until they close that possibility down.\
  \ Don\xB4t ruin the ruins. \n \n4. LOST CITY OF PETRA, JORDAN\n...forgotten for\
  \ hundreds and hundreds of years - later on it turned out it was a hidden city that\
  \ the beduin people in the area were well aware of. I\xB4m not gonna tell the story\
  \ (google can tell). It was so much bigger then would have imagined! We didn\xB4\
  t even seen half. A good reason to come back some day. In another season, winter\
  \ was freezing. Don\xB4t believe everything you see in social media (what really?)\
  \ - the influencers dressed in dresses standing in front of the famous Treasury\
  \ is just ****shit. 1. You should be covered up in religious places. 2. It\xB4s\
  \ cold in the winter. But hey, isn\xB4t it all lies on instagram? The ancient city\
  \ of Petra is not a lie thou - it\xB4s magical for real. \n \n5. THE STORY OF TAJ\
  \ MAHAL, INDIA \nI was amazed when I got there, it was so white and shiny it hurt\
  \ my eyes. This is a love story, a true love story between emperor Shah Jahan and\
  \ one of his wives, Mumtaz Mahal. As a proof that she was his all time favourite\
  \ wife she asked, on her death bed, when giving birth to their 14th child (yeah\
  \ you read it correct, 14!), that he would do something that no one has done before\
  \ - in loving memory of her. So there he goes, building the most expensive mausoleum\
  \ ever seen. Voila! \n\n6. BLOODY COLOSSEUM, ITALY \nThe whole of Rome should be\
  \ listed as a wonder. So many beautiful buildings - Colosseum is one of them! I\
  \ don\xB4t agree with the things it was built for, the bloody killing of both men\
  \ and animals for all the wrong reasons - simple entertainment. But I can\xB4t close\
  \ my eyes for the fact that it\xB4s still a fantastic building that we can enjoy\
  \ in modern time - without the killing. \n  \n7. THE PYRAMID OF CHICHEN ITZA, MEXICO\
  \ \nOk, I will not lie. I was not completely head over heels in love with this place\
  \ but it is an amazing pyramid and I\xB4m really really happy to have seen it live.\
  \ Since I\xB4ve already been to the mayan ruins in Guatemala, this was a little\
  \ bit\u2026ok, thats all? The best thing about this visit is that we where almost\
  \ alone, so great pictures without any tourist destroying my photos. Happy like\
  \ a true travel blogger."
