Text: "Unlike most Singaporean university students, I did not have a 6 months exchange\
  \ in a foreign country.\n\nNor did I quit my job and travel the world like so many\
  \ travel bloggers and people I met on my travels.\n\nInstead, here's my story.\n\
  \n\nI had a moment of realization while gliding through the air on the flying fish\
  \ (pictured above) in Kuta Beach, Bali.\n\n\"This is the best feeling ever! What\
  \ have I been missing out for the past 3 years?\"\n\nThat was the first time I flew\
  \ out of Singapore in three years, and the first trip abroad with friends.\n\nA\
  \ trip that changed my life.\n\nBefore that last minute trip (we made the decision\
  \ a day ago), I\u2019ve never given much thought to travelling.\n\nThroughout my\
  \ childhood, I\u2019ve travelled probably once a year with my mum and brother, staying\
  \ in the nearby regions of Asia and Australia.\n\nUntil 2011, when I was called\
  \ to serve the nation and my precious annual leave were saved for whatever activities\
  \ a 20-year-old thought were cool.\n\nOh boy, what a bad choice. I never knew what\
  \ I gave up.\n\nNo travels. No exploration. Nada.\n\nTurning Point\nSince that Bali\
  \ trip in 2014, I\u2019ve caught the travel bug and been in and out of Singapore\
  \ seven times each year for the next two years.\n\nThe two craziest years of my\
  \ life - striking off item after item on my bucket list, meeting people from all\
  \ over the world and pushing myself out of my comfort zone, trip after trip.\n\n\
  I\u2019ve jumped out of a plane in Brazil, dived in the beautiful oceans of Malaysia,\
  \ ran off a cliff in Vietnam, scaled the highest volcano in Indonesia, took a helicopter\
  \ ride above the majestic Angkor Wat temples in Cambodia and couchsurfed in Australia.\n\
  \n\nI\u2019ve travelled solo in multiple cities, travelled as an uncle with my adorable\
  \ nephews, travelled for the first time with my father in 25 years, travelled with\
  \ lovers, travelled with friends old and new, and even travelled for free, with\
  \ a 5-star hotel stay.\n\nI\u2019ve gotten lost, gotten robbed, gotten sick. Been\
  \ drunk on the streets. Starved till I couldn\u2019t speak. I\u2019ve cried and\
  \ smiled, loved and lost. And yet I yearn for it more: The feeling of plunging into\
  \ the unknown. The freedom that comes with exploration and living each day to the\
  \ fullest. The feeling of waking up every single day excited."
