Text: "Portugal is a land shaped by its love, the Atlantic Ocean. This ocean has brought\
  \ Portugal fame, riches and cultural diversity. I want to go to Portugal so that\
  \ I can capture the clicking of the cobblestones of Evora that bury the city\u2019\
  s Roman past. I want to convey the sensory overload caused by pondering golden plains\
  \ of the Alentejo to my reader. I want to take my reader to a boteco in Ericeira\
  \ where the deep melody of a soulful Fado takes you to a time that is closer than\
  \ one might think. \n\nThis trip would be an ideal opportunity to connect with the\
  \ locals through the language of Fernando Pessoa. I would strive to share the magic\
  \ that Portugal has to offer. \n\nI have always viewed Portugal with intense fascination,\
  \ not only for its inspiring landscapes but also because of its intense blend of\
  \ cultures. I often imagine myself walking through the alleyways of Alfama, following\
  \ the familiar twang of the Portuguese guitar to an unknown location. I feel that\
  \ the country\u2019s Moorish and Jewish past have shaped the country\u2019s culture\
  \ and people in such a way that this lasting influence is apparent in a simple interaction\
  \ with the locals. \n\nI would love to uncover the nuances of Portuguese culture\
  \ through intense reflection. This trip would be the ideal opportunity to seek the\
  \ kind of inspiration that can only come from immersion."
