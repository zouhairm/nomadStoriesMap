Text: "Miguel knew as much English as I knew Spanish - which was hardly enough to\
  \ get by. Our language barrier became apparent to us immediately after I had to\
  \ break the news to him that I had taken the wrong bus, almost two hours prior.\
  \ The news had sent him into a panic, that much was obvious, as he gripped my phone\
  \ tightly and paced back and forth outside. I was assigned to seat number two, located\
  \ directly behind his drivers seat and had the perfect view of his miniature meltdown.\
  \ Unsure of what it was exactly that sent him spiraling, I waited patiently as helped\
  \ the last of the other travelers claim their luggage. It could have been that my\
  \ dark features and caramel skin mislead him into thinking I was a fluent Spanish\
  \ speaker or that my osprey backpack/sidekick was my very own scarlet letter shouting\
  \ to the world that I was traveling alone. Whatever it was Miguel had now taken\
  \ on the task of getting me to my final destination even though I protested that\
  \ I could just take a taxi. An idea he instantly scoffed at, while pointing at me\
  \ and sternly telling me, \u201Ccancun no es bueno for you.\u201D \n\nMiguel never\
  \ let our ride together slip into silence. Trying his best to piece together his\
  \ broken English the best he could, he attempted to find out where I had come from\
  \ and where I was going. When I told him I had just come from Tulum he was already\
  \ in hysterics at his own joke, \u201Cyou love hipsters!\u201D Neither of us could\
  \ stop laughing for quite some time. He tried his best to tell me a story of another\
  \ female traveler who had been lost before and said that I was a much better off\
  \ because she was only able to communicate with him using sounds and pointing gestures.\
  \ Because our words were limited his story was mostly conveyed by him acting out\
  \ what had happened. His imitation of her girly grunts and flamboyant gestures had\
  \ both of us in tears from laughter. \n\nAs we got closer to where I was to catch\
  \ the next bus, the right bus, he gave me specific directions. When he told me I\
  \ was only to take bus one or two I jokingly replied, \u201CTres y cuarto, si.\u201D\
  \ He wasn\u2019t impressed. So per his request I repeated \u2018Uno o Dos\u2019\
  \ until he felt I had understood the severity of the situation. Afterwards I was\
  \ given directions to tell the next bus driver where I was going before I sat down.\
  \ When I told him the name of where I was staying we practiced that too, but my\
  \ poor pronunciation of the Spanish double r caused him a lot of worry. Up until\
  \ that moment I was fully confident in my ability to roll my r\u2019s, so when he\
  \ leaned down to pick up a piece of paper and took a pen out I was more than embarrassed.\
  \ He wrote two letter r\u2019s down and right under it he wrote a single one. Pointing\
  \ to one he\u2019d stress the proper pronunciation and wait for me to mimic the\
  \ sounds and then he moved on to the next. This mobile lesson went on for quite\
  \ some time until he pulled over right in the middle of traffic and told me it was\
  \ time to go. \n\nAs the red ado bus sped off, leaving me behind, I began to cry.\
  \ In a moment of reflection, I remembered how my home country was treating the people\
  \ of Mexico. Back home I was told there was nothing but danger waiting for me across\
  \ the border but, as I repeated \u2018uno o dos\u2019 faintly out loud I knew how\
  \ wrong they had been. Mexico and Miguel were the reason I was safe."
