Text: "Three thousand, one hundred and sixty eight kilometres, three african countries,\
  \ four old bastards and a naive support crew with a pipe dream bucket list, setting\
  \ off in the peak of the African sun, straddling the saddle in sub saharan Africa\
  \ on a journey with immeasurable change and a serendipitous epiphany far beyond\
  \ what i could imagine. Ironically Eric \u201Cchicken legs\u201D De Jong, lanky\
  \ in nature but with a metabolism of a kid in a candy store, and a mouth that could\
  \ sell ice to an eskimo was the leader of this wolf pack.  \n\nAfter one phone call,\
  \ i had solidified my spot on this African cycle tour that was set to kill two birds\
  \ with one stone, ticking off a bucket list, and raising funds for a good cause.\
  \  As a photographer and documentary filmmaker, ready for a travel adventure of\
  \ a lifetime, This was it, it was my time to shine, and reassure my new found passion\
  \ for travel storytelling all in hopes of making a difference. \n \nOne day into\
  \ the tour just outside Harare, Zimbabwe, with a logistically flawed plan, mapped\
  \ out like a bull in a china shop, i couldn\u2019t help think, what was i getting\
  \ myself into? I would be stuck on the thirty day tour with a generation preceding\
  \ my age. A giant leap into the unknown, my role as a photographer quickly developed\
  \ into a \u2018qualified\u2019 tour operator, logistics manager, public relations\
  \ expert and kitchen boy all at once. Social skills had to quickly be re-evaluated\
  \ and adapted for a sense of unity in the pack. Fit in or be outcast. \n\nRoughly\
  \ ten days in deep into rural Botswana, we found ourselves crawling towards the\
  \ finish goal. One day forward, two days back, as every kilometre brought about\
  \ a new experience, a new sight and a new found respect for mother nature. Unexplored\
  \ territory for the most of us, this now travel adventure \u201Cstory\u201D was\
  \ becoming harder and harder to conceptualise. Waking up every morning, under the\
  \ African skies, i read a quote i had scribbled in the front of my notebook. \n\n\
  \u201CTravelling is education. If you are paying attention, travelling across Africa\
  \ gives you a doctrine in culture.\u201D -Unknown\n\nUp until the last day of the\
  \ tour, this quote never resonated with me. It was becoming more prevalent that\
  \ this was going to be more than just a travel adventure. The days seemed to get\
  \ longer and harder, with challenging obstacles occurring almost daily. Chicken\
  \ legs, blas\xE9 to this, on this given day, sent me off ahead of the pack, with\
  \ one  definitive goal, Find us a place to camp for the night. Newly appointed PR\
  \ spokesman, in the heart of Rural Botswana and uneducated in Tswana, the local\
  \ language, i didn\u2019t expect to find myself, according to customary culture,\
  \ sitting on a small crate in the \u201CKgotla\u2019 or homestead, outside the kings\
  \ door. Sweating, not from the African sun, but how was i going to ask permission\
  \ and cross cultural bridges imposed on me. \n\nThe king comes out, in African time\
  \ (a phrase dubbed by the lack of urgency) and stares bewildered. As this is all\
  \ a new experience for me, the king too has never had a foreigner come request refuge\
  \ in their 'Kgotla.' This was the stepping stone to seeing us, with The kings blessings,\
  \ tented in the centre of the village in the Kraal (communal hall) with eyes on\
  \ us from all directions, like a celebrity on tour. \n\nAccomplishing this had given\
  \ me new hope for any obstacles the tour could throw our way. Roused by this accomplishment,\
  \ sitting under the local camel thorn tree, taking in what has just happened, opening\
  \ my notebook, glancing at the quote gave credit to what we were doing, and solidified\
  \ the reward. The reward bridging the gap, albeit a small step, in a cultural divide,\
  \ far outweighed the three thousand two hundred journey. I found my why.  The reward\
  \ for education is immeasurable. I didn\u2019t expect to find my love of travel\
  \ influenced by culture."
