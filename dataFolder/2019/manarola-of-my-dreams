Text: "One day I had a dream. A real one. While sleeping I crossed the ocean and I\
  \ went to visit Manarola without even know it\u2019s name is Manarola and it\u2019\
  s location is Italy. When I woke up that image of lots of colourful houses around\
  \ the mountain surround the ocean did not disappear from my mind and the last phrase\
  \ I said while I was still sleeping was \u201C This is my favorit place\u201D. It\
  \ was only a dream, another one. But, for some reason, I did not forget it. It was\
  \ good to stop and think about that image, the image of my favourite place. Days\
  \ went pass by and checking the Facebook page of a friend, I see something I have\
  \ never thought it could really exist. One picture seen made my mind stop for awhile,\
  \ my breath accelerate and my heart to be felt. It made me regress to a distant\
  \ dream I had once and remind me my favourite place. That was it. The same colourful\
  \ houses at the mountain surrounded by the ocean. I couldn\u2019t believe what I\
  \ was seeing. That was my favourite place and it has a name and location. This place\
  \ existes. Manarola, Italy. The place of my dream. It took 351 days for me to cross\
  \ the ocean and put my feet in Manarola. I counted every single day. Everything\
  \ I though during this 351 days was I need to be in my favourite place. My sweet\
  \ Manarola. I won\u2019t never forget the day I finally met Manarola. There it was.\
  \ Magnificent, colourful, magic. Tears rolled from my eyes. I closed them for a\
  \ while and thought about my dream ( a real dream I had while sleeping) and how\
  \ I worked hard to turn it more real, by crossing the ocean and putting my feet\
  \ on there. Being present not only in soul, but also in body. I opened my eyes again\
  \ and appreciated everything I was seeing at that moment. I understood the phrase\
  \ I said while dreaming \u201C this is my favourite place\u201D, because I have\
  \ never seeing such magnificent place in my whole life. I just dreamt with Manarola\
  \ once. Time enough to buy the tickets and run to this place. I left Manarola with\
  \ the certain that I do not need to dream again with this place to come back here.\
  \ At the end I realised that it might not just have been a dream...it perhaps was\
  \ a memory from another time, perhaps another life when I first been in Manarola.\
  \ Sweet dream of mine."
