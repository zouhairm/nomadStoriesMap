Text: "Who doesn't like to sit on the bank of a river with half dipped legs in the\
  \ water, listening to the sound of the river flowing and the cold winds cruising\
  \ through one's body?\nWell, jump back to 2018 when I sitting ideal in the summers,\
  \ doing nothing but just scrolling my Instagram. I saw a post of a famous photographer\
  \ he was wandering on the banks of the great Ganges in  Rishikesh and in a snap\
  \ of the second I thought of why not going to Rishikesh where I have never visited\
  \ before. I and my brother packed our bags and rushed to the 'yoga capital of the\
  \ world' infamous for Ram jhula and Lakshman jhula and has a lot to offer in terms\
  \ of spirituality and adventure, but beware of the notorious monkeys you'll find\
  \ there.\nWe reached Rishikesh in around 6 hours from Delhi by our personal vehicle,\
  \ one can easily find a decent hotel in Rishikesh as there are lots and lots of\
  \ them present in every corner of the city or you can also stay at an ashram at\
  \ a very cheap rate.\nAs both of us were exhausted we had a decent sleep and woke\
  \ up at 5 in the evening to attend the 'Ganga Arti' at the Parmarth Niketan Ashram\
  \ which is well known for the ghat side aartis that takes place at dusk and the\
  \ famous Shiva statue. After attending the aarti we went for some window shopping\
  \ in the local market of Rishikesh. For locals like us, the market was not a very\
  \ wonderful place as all the market stuff was common for us. But for shopping enthusiasts,\
  \ the market is like a paradise where one can find mesmerizing paintings and wooden\
  \ furniture. Then we went to the Triveni Ghat which is the confluence of Ganga,\
  \ Yamuna and Saraswati and the main ghat of Rishikesh to take a holy dip in the\
  \ pure water the of river Ganga and there we lit a floating candle which gave a\
  \ very pleasant feel to the soul and the mind with this we ended our day and went\
  \ back to our hotel. \nThe next day we woke up early in the morning and went for\
  \ some adventure as we know Rishikesh is very popular with the adrenaline junkies\
  \ who are lured by the white rapids of the Ganges and after a very great rafting\
  \ session we were starving for food, which was again lured by a very famous restaurant\
  \ of Rishikesh that is The Chotiwala which is an age-old family run business that\
  \ deserves a visit for sure. By that time it was dusk again and we were eager to\
  \ visit The Lakshman Jula and The Ram Jhula and to take some good shots, as it was\
  \ our last night in Rishikesh we visited all the temples possible which included\
  \ The Neelkanth Mahadev Temple and the Trimbakeshwar Temple. While we were walking\
  \ back to our hotel we felt we were missing something, we went back to the ghat\
  \ to grab that feeling which healed all the negativities and impurities of our minds\
  \ just by sitting in a corner with half dipped legs in the water listening to the\
  \ sound of the river Ganga flowing and yes the cold wind cruising through us."
