Text: "I don't like crowded and commercialized mountain trails. I want challenge!\
  \ \n\nAnd then, Mt. Napulauan welcomed me with open arms. \n\nDubbed as one of the\
  \ toughest mountains in the Northern region of the Philippines, my overconfident\
  \ self signed up for a climb after scaling the country's highest three months prior.\
  \ It is true that if one has finished a challenging climb, the next would be a cinch.\n\
  \nI kid myself. Mountains are deceiving, mountains had the last laugh.\n\nWe are\
  \ a group of seven climbers; four of them had been to the Himalayas. I have been\
  \ to Mt. Apo and scaled its toughest trail. I think this wouldn't be as much as\
  \ intimidating.\n\nUnexpectedly, the jump off point up to the summit would require\
  \ a non-stop, uphill walk. Not a leveled ground in sight for relief.  This was different\
  \ from my previous climbs as my legs were burning by each hour. Every five minutes\
  \ I would catch some breath. And curse. The trail was silent, gloomy, mossy-forested,\
  \ eerie and one should quit imagining things. Looking at the skies made it worse,\
  \ here comes our \"always unwelcoming guest\". The rain.\n\nThe ascent up to the\
  \ summit would take about ten hours at a very relaxed pace but we made it at seven.\
  \ Would I be proud of my new record when all I could think of was getting a cardiac\
  \ arrest that night? I still am backed by confidence when my stamina gets the better\
  \ of me. \n\nMorning came and rain didn't subside, I have been sleepless. Outside\
  \ was a dissapointment. My purpose of climbing was to see the best sunrise and here\
  \ I was, feeling deprived of a well-deserved view after yesterday's agonizing trek.\
  \ However, as we began to pack up, there was a sudden crack in the clouds and sun\
  \ peeked through. The surroundings began clearing up and clouds settled around us,\
  \ in a cottony sea that one would reach for his camera and click away. Everybody\
  \ cheered and sent their drones. Everybody bathed in the glorious golden hour. We\
  \ are practically children awed at the sight of a well-lit Merry-Go-Round. The feeling\
  \ was blissful but not for long. After fifteen minutes, everything was unseen again.\
  \ Like a blink of an eye, we're transported back to Silent Hill. But at least the\
  \ fleeting moment got us our dose of sanity.\n\nOur descent probably was insanely\
  \ the best part. That's my sarcasm right there. I wasn't prepared for a detour that\
  \ I thought was easier and safer. Yesterday was enough but prepare for another surprise!\
  \ By the looks of a two-inch wide and slippery trail that you have to gingerly side-step\
  \ downwards, you are a crying kid inside. If you were an animal, you'd wish to be\
  \ a gecko. \n\nYou'll find yourself bleed eventually, not just from cuts but leeches\
  \ making their way to feed on you. The bloody mess isn't something to worry about\
  \ as the steep drop from your side is literally \"death\" upon falling. Not a better\
  \ way to die.\n\nWhile your focus is solely trained at your own safety, you'll hear\
  \ a cry from a stumbling colleague but the adrenaline rush was quick enough to grab\
  \ onto some grass, in a preventive fashion. It was a mini heart attack to witness\
  \ so you'll start praying and cursing at the same time. Bend, crawl, sit. Repeat.\
  \ The obstacle course is endless and there's no room for carelessness. And close\
  \ calls.\n\nAs expected in any mountain climbing activity, the end was always sweet.\
  \ We are bloody, sore, rain-drenched yet feeling accomplished.  To some, we are\
  \ hard-bitten fools who are never introduced to comfort. But among ourselves, we\
  \ are bruised mortals who enjoy being tested; engaging all our senses to function\
  \ freely in tricky and challenging routes and see the fun in misery. We want to\
  \ feel brand new. And if feeling brand new would mean seeing new heights and venturing\
  \ into the unknown then you know where to find us.  We enjoy being out of whatever\
  \ emotional penitentiary we are confined in and be exposed in the vastness of punishing\
  \ landscapes but promising enough to offer us their ephemeral yet soulful pleasure.\
  \ And then, we call it home."
