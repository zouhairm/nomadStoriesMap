Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find a greater love for my country in the exploration\
  \ of other countries. I expected to find shame in our political scheme while touring\
  \ the United Kingdom. I expected to find envy of the rich, relaxed and established\
  \ culture of Europe. I expected to find more of the harsh judgements we heap upon\
  \ ourselves at the mistakes made by our government and forefathers in the company\
  \ of expatriates living in central America. I expected to feel disappointment in\
  \ the juvenile cityscapes of even the oldest of American cities as I walked the\
  \ streets of ancient Munchen or Lisboa. \nBut I didn\u2019t. Instead, I found curiosity\
  \ in the current events and personal feelings of Americans towards their political\
  \ leaders and decisions from multiple individuals across a variety of government\
  \ representation. I found Europeans full of shame or disappointment for their own\
  \ government\u2019s actions. I found respect and admiration of the premise of the\
  \ American government from a former soldier that fought for freedoms for his countrymen\
  \ in the dictatorships of Nicaragua. I found an eager thirst for the American work\
  \ ethic in the work schema of multiple European countries. I found an eager thirst\
  \ for learning about my \u201Cculture\u201D from the middle class and destitute\
  \ of Costa Rica. I found city after city that had survived or rebuilt after horrifying\
  \ disasters- natural or man-made. I found the facades of Munchen, while appearing\
  \ ancient, were frequently rebuilds after the destruction of World War II. I found\
  \ dedications for Viking archeologic sites destroyed by the machine of advancement\
  \ in Dublin. I found bits of ancient walls of medieval castles hugging new, more\
  \ modern buildings in multiple cities. I found freeways through the midst of Neolithic\
  \ stone rings in the UK. I found the same struggles, fears and shame in different\
  \ countries, with different background stories. I found a mutual hope and desire\
  \ for advancement and betterment from historical errors at all sites of travel.\
  \ I found areas where America has done well, and areas where we could learn to do\
  \ better. I found us to be different. Not in a bad way. Not in a better way. In\
  \ a way brought about by different experiences, different topography, different\
  \ challenges and adaptations. Yet we are similar in our hopes, dreams, desire for\
  \ improvement and well-being, and curiosity. We are a beautiful rendition of the\
  \ struggles in growth of any culture, and I love us all the more for having experienced\
  \ other culture\u2019s stories and lives."
