Text: "I had never been naked in front of so many people before. \n\nFrom the moment\
  \ I stepped off the plane, I knew people were watching me. Men were watching me.\
  \ Something in their eyes made me want to crawl back into my own skin. At that time,\
  \ I was clothed. I wore dark straight-legged, high waisted jeans and a gray long-sleeved\
  \ turtleneck. My fingers fell from my sleeves. The light olive-toned Irish-Italian\
  \ skin on the tops of my ears poked through my hair. Nothing more was exposed, but\
  \ I was. \n\nI was 21, on a weekend trip to Rabat, Morocco, to visit friends during\
  \ my semester abroad in Madrid. The night before, I dug into tortilla Espa\xF1ola\
  \ while my host mom, Puri, danced as she cleaned the dishes, all the while ranting\
  \ in rapid-fire Spanish about the Catalonian independence movement and the likelihood\
  \ that her son, Surgio, would one day marry, all in the same breath as if one were\
  \ related to the other. That afternoon, in another continent, I sat next to my friend,\
  \ Brianna\u2019s, round-bellied and smiling host father as I sank into a plate of\
  \ couscous large enough to feed an army. I caught the words \u201Cmange\u201D and\
  \ \u201Cfemme\u201D and ate with my fingers.  \n\nBrianna waited until that morning\
  \ to share the day\u2019s itinerary. Maybe she wanted it to be a surprise. Maybe\
  \ she thought I\u2019d say no. It doesn\u2019t matter\u2014I now stood in front\
  \ of her, cool limestone radiating through the soles of my feet and warm moisture\
  \ from the air settling into my hip creases. \n\nIn public hammams, dozens of nude\
  \ women amble through three rooms of warm steam, hot, dry air and jets of cool water.\
  \ They talk as they scrub their skin, absolving themselves of physical and spiritual\
  \ impurity. For Muslim women, it\u2019s a place for socializing and ritualistic\
  \ cleansing. It is a tradition that has held its importance in the faith since the\
  \ Ottoman Empire. Wars rages, nations changed powers, people died and babies were\
  \ born, but through hundreds of years, people still needed to bathe. And so, hammams\
  \ persisted. \n\nThey\u2019re a place for women to be free, and to be free in a\
  \ strong, patriarchal society, even for an hour, meant something. I had already\
  \ seen and experienced so many beautiful things far outside my realm of familiarity--dates\
  \ rolled in coconut shavings, leather bags hanging from metal hooks in the market,\
  \ intricate Arabic symbols carved into the keystone arch of a neighborhood passageway--but\
  \ I learned to quiet my hearing in the street. Come here my white lady, let me marry\
  \ you. I bet you taste good. Just one touch, please. Open your legs for me. Open\
  \ your legs for me. Open your legs for me. In the market. In restaurants. On the\
  \ beach. Fully clothed. I had never before been so aware of my gender. \n\nOf the\
  \ country\u2019s 9.5 million women, 6 million women ages 18-65 have experienced\
  \ violence, according to the Moroccan High Commission for Planning. Women living\
  \ in urban areas like Rabat were three times more vulnerable. That isn\u2019t to\
  \ say that many of these women didn\u2019t have loving husbands, loyal male friends\
  \ and chivalrous sons who treat women with love and respect. It\u2019s to say that\
  \ women often don\u2019t want to go into the streets alone without trusted men by\
  \ their sides. \n\nBut in this hammam, there was no fear. Women massaged oils and\
  \ thick, mud-like creams into my skin. Layer by layer, they lifted dirt and shame\
  \ and fear. I closed my eyes and traveled onto the streets of Rabat, ignoring the\
  \ catcalls, and back to the United States, where I let go of magazine covers and\
  \ fitness ads and diet plans. I recognized my body in ways I had never seen it before,\
  \ without cultural baggage or judgment, the soft rush of the cooling water a stark\
  \ difference from the baritone notes of society's voices. \n\nI laid on a marble\
  \ slab as a bare-chested Moroccan woman cleansed every inch of my body, and I mean\
  \ every inch. I marveled at the freedom havened within these cool limestone walls\
  \ as the woman\u2019s soft nipple brushed against my bare shoulder."
