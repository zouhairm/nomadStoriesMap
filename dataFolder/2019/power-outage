Text: "I had no expectations about the place. After all, all I wanted was to be away\
  \ during my birthday, to meditate, enjoy myself and get lost in a totally different\
  \ world.\nThe first day I went to the beach, walking along the coast, enjoying everything\
  \ so carefully I could always remember the colors of the sea, the sound of the frogs\
  \ croaking and the smell of fried plantains. I spotted an abandoned building, where\
  \ some locals were just having sunbaths. Everything was quiet I couldn\u2019t believe\
  \ I was in the Caribbean.\nThe second day, the guide I hired showed up to take me\
  \ to a remote national park, we would hike, visit some caves and shower in the beautiful\
  \ falls. My guide was friendly but not enough to \u201Cbreak the ice\u201D. As we\
  \ approached the city traveling back in his car, we noticed everything was dark.\
  \ Frightening dark. \nWe turned on the radio to realize the whole county had a power\
  \ outage. However, my hotel had its own power plant, so he decided to drop me there.\n\
  The next day Jorge, my guide, text me. His apartment had no electricity, so he offered\
  \ to drive me around. I had the most amazing day of my life.\nWe went to the south\
  \ of the Island, where the sea turns pink, visited the sugar plantations, the old\
  \ wall surrounding the city, the art district to admire the colorful graffiti and\
  \ drank beer at the viewpoint facing the rainforest. As the night fell we headed\
  \ the beach, that wasn\u2019t quite anymore. People with radios using batteries\
  \ set some music, and the neighbors started sharing the drinks and food on their\
  \ fridges. We danced, we played volleyball lightened by torches\u2026 I remembered\
  \ that we are meant to be together, to live and help each other.\nThe light never\
  \ came back. I was able to fly back to my home. My plans didn\u2019t go as I expected.\
  \ Just as I wanted."
