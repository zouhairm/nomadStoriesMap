Text: "\u2018\u2019You ok?\u2019\u2019 asked Captain, \u2018\u2019I\u2019m fine. I\
  \ think.\u201D \u201CAsante sana\u2019\u2019 \u2018\u2019thank you\u2019\u2019,\
  \ I replied, with one hand on the outrigger of the modernized dhow, rocking like\
  \ a wooden bassinet. I was numbed by torrents of rain and the warm calm below. The\
  \ Lagoon, mother nature\u2019s paradox.\n\nThree days ago, I arrived on Unguja Island,\
  \ commonly known as Zanzibar. Rich in spices and a once thriving base for traders\
  \ of the Arab world and the east, a lineage I share with this Island, with the occasional\
  \ European influence as all family trees go. This \u2018spice\u2019 island, reminiscent\
  \ of an abandoned antique shop, walled by a jungle of majestic palm trees and a\
  \ roof of large white cumulus clouds grasps a timeless harmony which has made it\
  \ a popular destination.\n\nThe south-east coast, an hour-long taxi ride from the\
  \ airport was going to be my sunny, humid oasis, except in the afternoons, when\
  \ the wet monsoon dumps some unforgiving rain on the Island. Jambiani village lacked\
  \ everything you\u2019d find in most generic travel brochures, but it was the perfect\
  \ backdrop for my five-day pilgrimage. As we drove through the country side filled\
  \ with coconut palm trees and the flat green grass covered plains, I remembered\
  \ her, the local farm-girl I shared a name with, an uncommon name for Swahili culture\
  \ but a tale the customs officials were about to share with me until it was abruptly\
  \ ended by the swarm of fresh tourists. This elusive tale would consume my thoughts\
  \ for the next few days, which I had enquired about amongst the locals at my hotel\
  \ and after three days and no ending to my story, I had finally taken a break from\
  \ my investigation to snorkel the turquoise lagoon with the highly recommended local\
  \ guide and appropriately named \u2018Captain\u2019. A short man in denim shorts,\
  \ t-shirt and umbrella. A sanguine with a penchant for Swahili riffing as we walked\
  \ along the warm white beach.\n\nAfter our duet of \u2018\u2019Mambo, mambo jambo\u2019\
  \u2019, \u2018\u2019do you have issue, do you have issue hello\u2019\u2019, we headed\
  \ through the low tide toward his anchored dhow. During the low tide the ocean bed\
  \ was filled with rocks covered in neon green sea grass beds, seaweed and starfish\
  \ which made the additional walk worthwhile, except for the \u2018\u2019urchins!\
  \ look out for the urchins\u2019\u2019, Captain shouted as he led the way. \u2018\
  \u2018Have you ever stepped on an urchin, Captain?\u2019\u2019, \u2018\u2019Yes\u2019\
  \u2019, he replied, \u2018\u2019painful?\u2019\u2019 I asked, \u2018\u2019no pain,\
  \ my feet are too hard\u2019\u2019, he replied jokingly. The unflattering evolution\
  \ of island life I suppose. After a strenuous game of chess with sea urchins we\
  \ finally reached the dhow, a traditional sailing vessel which had a mast and triangular\
  \ sail, and additional outriggers. The sails were set and with the first gust of\
  \ wind we were off, with the helpful push from two local fishermen. We headed to\
  \ the edge of the lagoon where grey clouds were gathering in preparation for the\
  \ afternoon rains. Unperturbed, we carried on with our morning snorkel in emerald\
  \ green bath water.\n\nAfter twenty minutes of gawking and snapping pictures, the\
  \ reef has suddenly gone from a bustling bazaar of brightly colored sea creatures\
  \ to an abandoned town. I popped my head back up from below the surface to find\
  \ the entire lagoon was fogged by dark clouds, wind and thunder in the distance.\
  \ The over-eager rain clouds have moved in over the lagoon sooner than expected.\
  \ Struggling to make my way back to the vague silhouette of a dhow through the choppy\
  \ waters, relentless sheets of rain were unleashed from above. I stopped to and\
  \ stayed still for a while to admire the formidable natural splendor, until a familiar\
  \ and welcomed melody in the distance. I pushed closer in that direction and there\
  \ he was, perched under his umbrella singing some mumbo jumbo. He waved and laughed\
  \ hysterically. \n\nSwaying from side to side alongside the dhow, nausea had taken\
  \ over but the rains had finally taken a break. We rested for a few more minutes.\
  \ \u2018\u2019Captain, what\u2019s the story Jehan, the girl from here?\u2019\u2019\
  , I asked, out of breath and slightly fatigued. He shrugged his shoulders, \u2018\
  \u2019didn\u2019t she survive this storm?\u201D We smiled."
