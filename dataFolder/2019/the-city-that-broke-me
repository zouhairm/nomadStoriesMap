Text: "There I was, all alone, in a strange town that I will soon call home.\n\nIt\
  \ was a cold wet windy winter night when I stepped out of the airport. I immediately\
  \ regretted my decision to wear a breathable cotton shirt when the breeze hit my\
  \ skin. Albeit, nothing can overpower the silence that greeted me. Apart from other\
  \ passengers, it was just me - in the middle of Perth airport, waiting for my friend\
  \ to arrive.\n\nPerth is a peculiar city to the foreign eye. Boutique stores close\
  \ at 5 pm and most pubs and bistros shut at 1 or 2 in the morning. It can almost\
  \ feel like a ghost town at certain parts of the suburbs. Meanwhile, I was raised\
  \ in a loud and rambunctious city. Manila is never shy to turn up the volume at\
  \ 4 in the morning when it comes to karaoke. Everywhere you go and whenever it may\
  \ be, there's always going to be a restaurant or a store to accommodate you. It's\
  \ almost a city that never sleeps. \n\nIt was a big adjustment to live in Perth.\
  \ I didn't know anybody outside of my friend, his girlfriend and his family. I slept\
  \ on a couch for a month with nothing, but a pillow and two blankets to defend myself\
  \ against the cold. I went to interviews and work trials only to be rejected countless\
  \ times. I didn't have a job for six months and my savings were almost gone, so\
  \ I once walked for almost two hours just to get home after missing my last trip.\
  \ Finally, despite my best efforts, language was still a barrier. I wouldn't understand\
  \ a local even if they had said 'water' three times. How else am I supposed to ask\
  \ for a direction? Everything was unlike anything I've ever experienced before and\
  \ if we had to go into the minuscule detail, I even had trouble getting the washing\
  \ machine to work. You might be thinking that's ridiculous, but this was never my\
  \ life.\n\nIn Manila, my mother took care of everything. I didn't have to cook or\
  \ prepare meals, wash the dishes, buy groceries, budget my finances, clean the house,\
  \ pay the rent or wash my clothes. Everything was done for me. To add fuel to the\
  \ fire, I never had any trouble getting a job. I was always a big fish in a small\
  \ pond and I felt suffocated and incompetent. I didn't know any life skills to survive.\
  \ I was just there - sleeping.\n\nPerth was the city that woke me up. It was the\
  \ city that taught me gratitude. It was the city that showed me hard work. It was\
  \ the city that demonstrated what real independence is. It was the city that taught\
  \ me how to fight for what I believe in. It was the city that guided me in finding\
  \ a voice again. It was the city that lives in different cultures and thrives. It\
  \ was the city that gave me purpose, motivation and drive. Most of all, Perth was\
  \ the city that broke me and I wouldn't have it any other way. It was the city that\
  \ made me feel again, and through that, I am finally alive."
