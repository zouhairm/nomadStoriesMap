Text: "In the middle of a bed, in the centre of a tipi, in the middle of a forest,\
  \ I lay still. Aided by the faint glow of the little solar-powered lamp, staring\
  \ at the netting, hazy as if in a dream, I fall asleep to the sound of raindrops\
  \ hitting the canvas one by one. I dismiss the mouldy smell of the damp earth inside\
  \ the tipi. I dismiss the buzzing outside the net. And slowly as the rain makes\
  \ its way back to the earth, my worries of being eaten alive by bugs were washed\
  \ away too. \n\nI wake up to the sound of the birds and cicadas while the warm morning\
  \ light chased the dampness out. I can see an insect was caught in the netting.\
  \ It seems that the world has turned without my knowing, overnight. And here I am\
  \ just fine. I was so anxious about this trip. It was the first time I\u2019ve ever\
  \ gone completely on my own and the closest I\u2019ve ever been to nature*. When\
  \ you are alone, you have to look out for yourself. But when you are alone, you\
  \ are just yourself. It\u2019s like running into someone you knew a long time ago\
  \ and taking them for a much-deserved catch-up.\n\nI walk a fair length of Manu\
  \ Bay barefoot. Black sand beach and freezing water. The waves weren\u2019t as big\
  \ that day and the surfers were few. I was on the edge of the shore, just close\
  \ enough to the water that I could not leave any tracks. The voices fade away eventually\
  \ and all I hear is the water, ebbing and flowing. Breaking and putting things together.\n\
  \nI was having some sort of life crisis when I decided to go. Raglan was the last\
  \ stop before I head back. I have never felt so at peace than when I was just walking\
  \ by the beach, the water magnifying my every step. I literally drew a line in the\
  \ sand that morning, and the sea has taken away all that came before. I could have\
  \ walked the whole day, aimless but satisfied. There is nothing like the infinite\
  \ sky overhead, miles of coast on either side of me, and a great big body of water\
  \ running all the way to the horizon that makes one feel so small and inconsequential.\
  \ And, by extension, all the worries one holds so trivial. For how can we be so\
  \ small and yet carry so much baggage? I could have walked the whole day and even\
  \ with my legs getting heavy I would still have felt ethereally light.\n\nI was\
  \ going to start by telling you come to Raglan and go surfing. It is a sleepy beach\
  \ town with more environmentalists than tourists.** But I couldn\u2019t tell you\
  \ about the surf or the volcano or the hiking trails because I\u2019ve never been\
  \ there. I was going to tell you to just sit by the water and listen. And find joy\
  \ in that. I was going to tell you not to expect epiphanies but that would be a\
  \ lie. Travel throws that at you anyway no matter where you are regardless of whether\
  \ you\u2019re in the middle of a medina, a castle on a hill, or a small town in\
  \ the north island of New Zealand (which everyone says is not as beautiful as the\
  \ south).\n\nIn Maori, New Zealand is known as \u2018Aotearoa\u2019, the long white\
  \ cloud. Raglan is 'Whaingaroa', the long pursuit.\nI came here because I put down\
  \ in my list that I should go camping. I put it down because of Kerouac's Dharma\
  \ Bums. Kerouac was too convincing. What I didn\u2019t know was how quietly true\
  \ it all was. Swap Desolation for the bay, a cabin for a tipi, and the sense of\
  \ liberation remains the same.\n\nIf you\u2019re ever in the north island of New\
  \ Zealand, come to Raglan. It is a dreamy place. I met myself there. Maybe you will\
  \ too.\n \n*As opposed to being in the middle of a busy metropolis in a hotel with\
  \ indoor plumbing and room service\n**Don\u2019t quote me on this"
