Text: "The Northern Italian spring time is a magical part of the year. The weather\
  \ quickly turns from a brisk chill to a warming hue, the grass turns greener and\
  \ the cicadas come out of their hiding spots to endlessly chirp away. The streams\
  \ glisten and flow wildly as the alpine snow begins to melt and the water trickles\
  \ down to fill up the streams, creeks and lakes. There is renewed activity on the\
  \ streets, balconies and little lanes as the people come out of their winter hibernation\
  \ to take in the morning sun. Little old ladies wake up early to put out their washing,\
  \ humming away and with a click and a clack of pegs the apartment blocks and terraces\
  \ are covered in sheets, towels and clothes being warmed through with the gentle\
  \ heat. They start to chatter incessantly to their neighbors, sometimes mere metres\
  \ away sometimes on the next block. Raising their voices and with a flourish of\
  \ hands and arms they put the world to rights as old women always do.\n\nI had spent\
  \ nearly two weeks in Lodi. I was invited to visit by a friend and had spent the\
  \ best part of my time in a little terrace apartment built in the latter part of\
  \ the twentieth Century, sometime after the war. It was built of shabby, red brick\
  \ and caked with dust.\n\nThe kitchen was covered with flour after the mornings\
  \ cooking and large bunches of salami and ham hung from the ceiling, gently swaying\
  \ in the breeze.\n\nAlready a spread of cheeses, ham and antipasti were sitting,\
  \ in great numbers, on the dining room table, much more than the household could\
  \ eat but this was the way of Italian meals, they serve for ten when a meal for\
  \ three would do. We sat and ate and talked, albeit in my broken Italian, and briskly\
  \ wolfed down the savory salamis and the gooey, smelly cheeses spread on crusty\
  \ bread. A thimble of limoncello, sticky and sweet, went down easily and refreshingly.\
  \ \n\nA walk around the town at this time of year was a delight. The cobblestoned\
  \ streets took in the heat of the day, glistening and shining and creating an echo\
  \ of footsteps from the morning rush. The sounds of click, clack rang around with\
  \ business men in their sharp, black suits walked briskly down the main thoroughfare\
  \ speaking quickly and with purpose on their phone. \n\nThe city was old and a tad\
  \ worn, but had the ancient charm that these little backwaters do. Old men stood,\
  \ hunched over their balconies smoking and squinting as the sun broke through the\
  \ trees, they didn\u2019t say a word, just puffed and waved with gusto at anyone\
  \ they knew ambling down the street. \n\nA walk down to the river that sits at the\
  \ towns rear brings with it all the joys of an Italian spring. The waterway is lined\
  \ with a sprinkling of silvery, grey olive trees and surrounded by coarse, green\
  \ grass. A few fishermen sat at its banks sitting on wooden crates and staring intently\
  \ into the rush of water below. They didn\u2019t seem fussed or stressed, I dare\
  \ say they didn\u2019t even care if they got a bite, they just sat there in silence\
  \ whilst the cicadas chirped loudly and the trees bristled with the activity of\
  \ little birds.\n\nOn the walk to the train station to say my goodbyes little old\
  \ ladies were shutting the cream painted metal shutters on their houses, with a\
  \ chorus of noise they all rattled shut to keep the apartments cool. \n\nThe train\
  \ station was a small, nineteenth century structure, coloured in a salmon pink and\
  \ stood proudly from another time. There was no one about and the only noises were\
  \ the papers and bottles being pushed against their will down the street with a\
  \ clatter by the wind. I took one last look down the main street as the shadows\
  \ crept along it and knew then that i wanted to return. The town was sleepy, old\
  \ and worn yet had a hue of mystery and rural charm that would keep me connected\
  \ to it even now."
