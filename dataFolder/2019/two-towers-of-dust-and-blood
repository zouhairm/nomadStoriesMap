Text: "In the heart of Porto Alegre, Brazil\u2019s southernmost capital, located 600\
  \ miles from S\xE3o Paulo, a local legend involving the first church of the city\
  \ goes through the centuries and feeds the belief in an ancient curse. Lying only\
  \ 10 meters above the sea level, Porto Alegre was founded at 18th century. It started\
  \ as a small peninsular village on the banks of Gua\xEDba, the main watercourse\
  \ of the region, about which even nowadays there\u2019s no consensus if it\u2019\
  s a river or a lake \u2013 in fact, due to the divergence, the locals prefer to\
  \ call it just Gua\xEDba. \nOnce the city grew and expanded itself from this water\
  \ basin, the Historical Centre of Porto Alegre flourished on its surroundings, not\
  \ properly on its geographic center, but on its limits to the west. Not far from\
  \ these waters, the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows stands on the downtown's sidewalk\
  \ as an inheritance from the Brazilian\u2019s colonial era and all the tragic events\
  \ that witnessed since its fundamental stone was laid, in 1807.\nThe Church of Sorrows\
  \ \u2013 how the parish is called \u2013 always captures people\u2019s attention\
  \ because of its stairways. Even though one of the oldest buildings of Porto Alegre,\
  \ the name is unknown to many, who refer to the parish as \"the big stairs church\"\
  . There are 63 steps until the entrance porch and the two towers, lifted in gothic\
  \ style, each reaching 62 meters high. Despite of their grace, for two centuries,\
  \ both carry a curse.\nThe towers were raised with the forced labour of slaves who\
  \ were lent by their masters, whom were very close to the brotherhood that has founded\
  \ the temple. In the 1850s, the church accused a constructor, a slave called Josino,\
  \ of stealing bricks of the building. Although he had alleged innocence, Josino\
  \ was considered guilty and sentenced to death. \nOn the 9th of November of 1854,\
  \ there was no cars neither the paving stones today so typicals to the Historic\
  \ Centre of Porto Alegre. In that day, a cortege left the church by the Grace Street\
  \ \u2013 the current (and busy) Andradas Street \u2013 towards the Armoury Beach\
  \ until the Hanging Place, the execution\u2019s square. It takes just a five minute\
  \ walk between the parish and the grove where Josino was hanged, place which today\
  \ is considered one of the Black Territories of the city in honor to the slaves\
  \ who have died there. \nIn line with the historian S\xE9rgio da Costa Franco, author\
  \ of the historical guide of Porto Alegre, before ascending to the gallows, Josino\
  \ prayed a plague: in proof of his innocence, his master would never see the parish\u2019\
  s towers concluded, because he was not the thief. Until then, the towers\u2019 edification\
  \ had already took fifty years and would take a half century more to be concluded.\
  \ In the meantime, they were strucked by a lightening and a fire, and one of the\
  \ towers collapsed days before the inauguration. \n\u201CThe west tower only got\
  \ ready on december of 1900 and the east side one, on 1901\u201D, says Franco in\
  \ his book. \nTherefore, neither the Josino\u2019s master nor his executioners came\
  \ to see the towers concluded \u2013 what helped to strengthen the curse's story.\n\
  According to the Church of Sorrows\u2019 museologist Caroline Zuchetti, meanwhile,\
  \ there\u2019s no mention to none slave Josino in the parish archives. Registers\
  \ talk about another slave with a similar name, the constructor Joselino, who was\
  \ also accused for stealing building materials. Besides, the documents boost the\
  \ strong conexion between the church and the hangings.\n\u201CEven the gallows were\
  \ supposedly kept in the church's basements\u201D, explains the museologist. \n\
  Meantime, a specific study about the hanged people in Porto Alegre, headed by Franco,\
  \ reveals the existence of a slave who'd cursed the church, not called Josino but\
  \ Manoel. According to the search, he belonged to one of the rich families of the\
  \ city that now and then made donations to the parish. \nIn the end, the curse was\
  \ a good smokescreen to a very, very seasonal charity of this benefactors. Even\
  \ today, the parish struggles for internal completion and maintenance. Between the\
  \ rituals and septanaries which the Church of Sorrows hosts throughout the years,\
  \ its incompleteness helps to keep alive the legend."
