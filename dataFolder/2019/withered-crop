Text: "The funny thing about the story that I am going to write it is that it is written\
  \ in an abstract way, a figurative and poetic arrangement of words, because that\
  \ my style when I write and that\xB4s how exactly the ideas and feelings came inside\
  \ my head when I visited this amazing place that now I want it to become my future\
  \ home:\n\nWithered Crop\n\nWithered skin of cork oak, beautiful leafy green adhered,\
  \ horizontal light in incomprehensible distances, give me your mystery, wrap in\
  \ a dark of reddish earths and ruby-colored vines. Although the deep ground is ancient\
  \ soul, your blue blood periphery professes a millenary dialect of navigators and\
  \ usurpers of the Seven Seas. Visiting gaze, humble gaze, accompany me to the extenuating\
  \ astonishment of an eternal and so bizarre diffusion radiant with glimpses into\
  \ feelings of belonging, almost false belonging.\n\nI do not believe in the equality\
  \ of my language, I believe in the beauty of singing touching in my ear, song of\
  \ female nations, notions of melancholy and guitar, guitar of maidens. Twilight\
  \ almost stormy eyes, cloudy light delight and sun-rimmed among the relief figures.\
  \ So I get the name of the ancient west, peninsula fishermen and navigators nascent.\
  \ Streets flavor ship, population view misunderstood in the race, modernity smell\
  \ versatile and the mystery is within the abandonment of your windows, the wood\
  \ that from within looks at your avenue, avenue of fire rising and moderate ears\
  \ listening, no language of additions wasted words. At the end of the crooked gorge\
  \ of the nobles, let the juice of your vines run down my throat, vines with sweetness\
  \ and splendid old-age demonstration, stale opaque perfection, leave your essence\
  \ in my mouth and remain in my body, melancholy port, you are from my west."
