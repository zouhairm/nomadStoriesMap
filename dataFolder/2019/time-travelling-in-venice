Text: "Time travelling in Venice\nTo discover a place you have to get lost, avoid\
  \ all the crowded, touristic spots. Choose a street, the most hidden one, the darkest\
  \ one and follow it until its very end.\nThat was my philosophy when I arrived in\
  \ Venice. It was a hot day in August, the city was full of people from all over\
  \ the world, all of them following the same way: straight to San Marco square.\n\
  I saw on my left a narrow street between two buildings with bars on their windows,\
  \ no one going there. Not a place to go for a tourist, a possible spot for a traveller,\
  \ for the difference is: a tourist seeks for superficial beauty, a traveller looks\
  \ for adventures, new things waiting to be discovered, new cultures and hidden beauty.\n\
  I went there finding myself in a sort of maze: high buildings surrounding me, hardly\
  \ no sunlight. Going ahead I started hearing music, traditional music, and road\
  \ signs in Jewish language, nothing I could understand. \nKeep going that music\
  \ got louder and louder until I found myself in a square, full of light, full of\
  \ people dancing and singing, dressed as if we were back in the 30s. In that moment\
  \ I really understood and felt like Dante\u2019s getting out from hell: \u201CLo\
  \ duca e io per quel cammino ascoso/ intrammo a ritornar nel chiaro mondo;/ [\u2026\
  ] tanto ch\u2019i\u2019 vidi de le cose belle/ che porta \u2019l ciel, per un pertugio\
  \ tondo./ E quindi uscimmo a riveder le stele//\u201D. Stargazing. From darkness\
  \ to light, the light of something unknown but surely mesmerizing.\nI was astonished\
  \ by all of this, it felt like coming back with time and, at the same time, finding\
  \ myself in a totally different country. I asked a girl around my age what was going\
  \ on \u2013 it\u2019s Saturday, we celebrate Shabbat \u2013 she answered.\nI ended\
  \ up right in the middle of one of the oldest Jewish communities in Italy. To protect\
  \ themselves, their culture and their story they tend to be close towards strangers\
  \ but surprisingly I found myself at ease between those people.\nThat girl gave\
  \ me some focuses on her own life in the community, she was born there, she went\
  \ to Jewish schools since she was a little girl. In Venice every Jew speaks his\
  \ ancient language fluently, finding Italian a little difficult. In fact, they tend\
  \ to speak English also with Italian people.\nAll those people sat together at long\
  \ tables in the middle of the square to share a meal, singing and talking about\
  \ their lives, their week and their experiences. It really moved me for I had never\
  \ experienced something so full of life and love as that scene. They acted like\
  \ a huge family with a strong sense of cohesion and sharing.\nToo soon my trip went\
  \ on, I had to leave that little fragment of the city to dive in the present time.\
  \ \nI crossed all the ghetto to the northern part of the city finding university\
  \ students having the classic \u201Caperitivo\u201D celebrating the end of the exams\
  \ session. \nWalking I ended up in another timeless spot: Acqua Alta bookshop. It\u2019\
  s a little building under the sea level where you can easily find all sort of books,\
  \ from novels to essays, also ancient books about the city and its history. Right\
  \ behind the shop there are stairs made of books. If you walk them, you find yourself\
  \ at the sea level on one of the many channels that cross Venice.\nThere isn\u2019\
  t a univocal meaning behind this \u201Cpiece of art\u201D, I like to think about\
  \ it as an ascesis from darkness to light through culture and literature. Knowledge\
  \ comes from the past, what remains of the past is what our ancestors wrote.\nInteresting\
  \ is that near this little spot there is San Marco square and all the luxury shops.\
  \ \nAt the end of the day I realised how Venice is a melting pot as well as common\
  \ metropolis even if it\u2019s very small. It is a collage of past and present.\
  \ Tradition is a crucial part of citizens\u2019 lives, it envelops every person\
  \ that ends up there. Unknown things are always behind the corner."
