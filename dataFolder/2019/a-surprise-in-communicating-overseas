Text: "Born and raised in Melbourne, Australia I didn't expect that I would have the\
  \ opportunity to live anywhere else let alone Germany. From a middle class family\
  \ where travel was an extreme luxury, the thought of moving countries seemed like\
  \ a fantasy I would only ever read about or see others live out in movies. But here\
  \ it was, the chance to leave the place I have called home for 25 years.\n\n\nI\
  \ knew very little of the culture except the unfortunate Nazi stereotypes and those\
  \ that paint Germans as very boring and emotionless. I had no idea what to expect,\
  \ and what I discovered and experienced was way more tham I had bargained for and\
  \ definitely more than I had hoped for.\n\nFrom the full history to the indescribable\
  \ and intricate detailing in their architecture, I found so many befriending me\
  \ speaking my native language of English.\n\n\nFrom imitations of British and American\
  \ accents to German and European accents speaking English, I was left relieved that\
  \ I was able to communicate quite easily with this group of people who have lived\
  \ such a different life than mine and also not all that different.\n\n\nGermans\
  \ are a different kind of party people. Germany is of course famous for Oktoberfest\
  \ but they have all kinds of carnivals and festivals throughout the year. They love\
  \ colour and they love to be involved in their communities. Whilst overall they\
  \ are a reserved group of people, speaking generally of course, the Germans know\
  \ how to throw a party and they know how to do it extremely well. For me, the experience\
  \ was so unexpected that I was left shocked and amused at how different the people\
  \ I came to know would present themselves in these varying environments compared\
  \ to the workplace or a more average social situation like drinks at a bar.\_\n\n\
  \nThe Germans are a very formal group of people which is very present in their language.\
  \ Feeling like a fool after learning this, I was genuinely humbled by the fact that\
  \ any German I had come across prior to this had given grace to my ignorance and\
  \ had not corrected me. To further explain, it is standard practice in Germany to\
  \ refer to one another as Herr or Frau which is Mr or Mrs respectively and the individuals\
  \ surname. Rarely is a first name offered in professional work settings. Colleagues\
  \ who have known each other for 20 plus years still refer to each other as Herr\
  \ or Frau, always maintaining the professional distance.\_\n\nI was made aware that\
  \ this cultural norm is slowly dying out with the youngest generation finishing\
  \ high school currently and the growing influence of the English culture in Germany.\n\
  \n\nI then was lucky enough to have had the opportunity to teach English to Germans\
  \ and other Europeans living in Germany at varying levels. What a humbling job to\
  \ see people in such vulnerability. So smart and knowledgable in their own language\
  \ and yet they struggle to find the right word in English leaving them feeling incompetent.\
  \ I know the feeling well. It's the same gut wrenching feeling I get when I don't\
  \ know the word in German and am not sure how I am going to communicate what I want\
  \ or need. These days we have easy access to software like Google translate but\
  \ I sit and wonder in awe at the people who migrated years ago like my grandparents\
  \ did; how did they do it back then?\n\n\nI have found many Germans fascinated by\
  \ my home country, is it dangerous, is it not, is it as beautiful as in the pictures?\
  \ It is so far away. And yet, here I am fascinated by their culture, the opportunities\
  \ that they have available and how exposed they are to other cultures. I find myself\
  \ at times feeling entitled, how can I speak English and expect others to speak\
  \ English in a non English speaking country and yet here I was, speaking to native\
  \ Germans in my own native language of English able to communicate easily. What\
  \ an unexpected and yet humbling surprise."
