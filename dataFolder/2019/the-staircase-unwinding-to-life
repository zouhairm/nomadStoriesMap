Text: "Breathing the fresh whiff of scented trees and musty locale, we finally reached\
  \ Dehradun - the city where every emotion finds peace. It had been nausea driven\
  \ 7-hour long journey, through the bending roads in the cut of the hills. Moreover,\
  \ we had preferred a state-transport bus, so as to enjoy the view whilst we reached\
  \ our destination. Little did we know that one designated pee-break in between would\
  \ halt our plans for the evening. As the night descended, the first thing we searched\
  \ for was our driver, who was paid to take us to Kanataal - a small town in the\
  \ hilly regions of Uttarakhand. By now, all of us had given up on food and survived\
  \ only on the leftover chocolates, bought at Delhi's Kashmere Gate Bus station.\
  \ Unsatiated, we relied on the immediate measures, but our stomachs angered more\
  \ when the driver went missing. After frantically calling him for another 45 minutes,\
  \ he showed up, a little drunk. This time, we were sure that our plans are not in\
  \ the mood to toast us, but have a bottoms-up in this situation. Nevertheless, with\
  \ his confidence and our prayers, we moved ahead to complete about 3000 ft upward\
  \ distance to our hotel stay. \n\nTo reach Kanataal, the transport needs to be taken\
  \ through a jungle and many risky and tricky roads that can result in people plummeting\
  \ to deaths as well. \n\nOur desperation to reach hotel had piqued by now. It wasn't\
  \ because we wanted to get comfortable and take some rest, which we did, but that\
  \ wasn't the only real motive. It was to save money, as the hotels in Dehradun were\
  \ expensive, this time of the year and we had a tight schedule to cover as many\
  \ places as possible in the bleak window of 4 days. \n\nThe guards assigned by the\
  \ Government stopped us at the checkpoint and refused to let us move forward. However,\
  \ our persuasion and the right cards, let them give in. With zero visibility to\
  \ our future, we charged on. Each bend had our throats come to our mouth and gulp\
  \ a sigh of relief as we passed. After gradually moving on for about 3 hours, we\
  \ reached a town. Unfamiliarly, it was pitch dark to make out whether we had reached\
  \ a correct place. Also, going down wasn't an option now. The driver had already\
  \ given us his verdict on the same. So, we thought we could now only search for\
  \ the hotel to know whether we were right and do gown tomorrow if we think we aren't\
  \ in the right place.\n\nHave you ever felt the jibe of something cold, sharp pass\
  \ through your heart, if you were ever cheated?\n\nWell, multiply this feeling with\
  \ a 100 to the amplification of it coming from 5 individuals in the wee hours. Not\
  \ easy! Absolutely, not. We were stranded in a deserted colony, not knowing what\
  \ to do. Plus, the hotel turned out to be a hoax. There wasn't even a single person\
  \ in sight. We now urgently looked for options to pass the night. \n\nWe measured\
  \ the lengths and the breadths of the colony where the echo of wind blowing and\
  \ lights being on in the house, but none answering their doors for help, scared\
  \ us further. This time, one of the bravehearts led us to knock a few more houses,\
  \ till a man, in his undershorts and a t-back, agitatedly told us that we have just\
  \ one lodge - Anand and that may be full too. But ask the owners maybe they could\
  \ offer you a place till the morning.\n\nThe door bangs were so loud that the entire\
  \ lodge got disturbed, but not the owners. Sinking into their deep sleep with each\
  \ passing minute, they were least bothered. Finally after shining torches on their\
  \ windows, making plea stories and begging for help, did they allow us. The ordeal\
  \ came to an end.... or at least that is what we thought. After all, just a roof\
  \ over your head doesn't solve all your problems."
