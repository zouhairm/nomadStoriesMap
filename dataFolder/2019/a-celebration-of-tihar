Text: "More than fifteen adults crowded into a cramped concrete cube and hundreds\
  \ of excited eyeballs belonging to young Nepali children stared through the holes\
  \ in the walls nosily. Six British victims sat shoulder-to-shoulder on a single\
  \ wooden bed frame while the locals whispered secrets in a foreign language. \n\
  Across the grey, sandy floor lay the only blanket the family owned, topped with\
  \ melting candles and bowls handmade from leaves and twigs holding what seemed like\
  \ a mix of paint and uncooked rice. I had watched my host grandmother spend hours\
  \ manufacturing the bowls stick by stick, leaf by leaf after dinner each night,\
  \ wondering what they would be used for. Finally I know. She was the first to start\
  \ singing in a screechy, wailing tune as she strode into the bedroom swinging an\
  \ armful of colourful, handmade flower necklaces. \nOne by one she called on us,\
  \ cheering and giggling while the others in the room continued the traditional song,\
  \ swaying and staring indulgently. Our host sister- didi- knelt down and picked\
  \ up the multi-coloured, paint-covered rice and smiled to us in her childish manner.\
  \ \n\u201CTika\u201D she whispered.\nA thumb was dipped into the red tika and blobs\
  \ were smeared on our foreheads with precise accuracy, then, orange, then yellow,\
  \ then green in a lumpy, multi-coloured snail trail to the centre of our eyes. Once\
  \ we were tika ready, our little sisters- buhinis- skipped in, giggling and launched\
  \ pale flower petals over our heads and across the room. Our grandmother waddled\
  \ back in and handed us each a thirty centimetre wide leaf and twig bowl containing\
  \ bananas, selroti, rice, potatoes, roti, beans, guava and more ranges of food I\u2019\
  d never heard of or seen. More than they probably ate a week and definitely more\
  \ ingredients than they could afford. But they did this for us. \nMy host sister\
  \ took my hand and I put the bowl of food on the bed, while munching on a crispy\
  \ selroti, and she led me outside while other villagers took the hands of the other\
  \ Brits. Our house stood on the top of a Nepali mountain surrounded by a village\
  \ which twisted and turned, concealed by green forests and overgrown bushes, weeds\
  \ tangling around concrete. Sleeping on our porch was a ragged looking brown haired\
  \ dog with a makeover- his tika matched mine but reaching from between his ears\
  \ on the top of his head to between his eyes and a flower necklace hung off his\
  \ neck. He looked as if he felt ridiculous, similar to me.\nThe local villagers\
  \ led us to a grassy open space where men and women already danced to drums and\
  \ more wailing songs. Saris swayed around the women\u2019s bodies and wrists twisted\
  \ elegantly moving to the beat while men clapped their hands and stamped their feet.\
  \ The group expanded into a perfect circle and they nudged us in, keeping up the\
  \ beat and staring expectantly, bright eyed and shining teeth on show. \nI grabbed\
  \ my host mother\u2019s hand and pulled her in to dance with me, copying as she\
  \ swayed her hips, tapped her toes and raised her arms. She looked beautiful in\
  \ a red patterned kurtha and matching trousers, tika striped down her head and lips\
  \ pursed together, trying not to laugh at my feeble attempt at dancing.\nThe villagers\
  \ started a new song and they all sang along to make an out-of-tune choir, before\
  \ setting up a modern speaker system in the background which played bubbly Hindi\
  \ music mixed in with Asian covers of modern pop songs. We partied until midnight\
  \ when a campfire started to sizzle and the villagers kneeled in their usual manner\
  \ with a plastic reused bottle filled with homemade rice-wine which streaked their\
  \ eyes red and burned their lips. The village chatted as a family, the girls ran\
  \ their fingers through my hair and asked about our clothes. The men invited us\
  \ to play games with them on the top of the mountain and we thankfully agreed. Some\
  \ people just asked us to take photos of them and to spread them throughout social\
  \ media and make them famous. \nNot once did I feel uncomfortable though because\
  \ we were officially part of the family."
