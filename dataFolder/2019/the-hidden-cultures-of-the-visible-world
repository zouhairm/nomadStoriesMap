Text: "Having lived all my life in Accra, the capital, it was an exciting news in\
  \ itself to be asked to tag along on a trip to Obuasi, miles away into the unknown.\
  \ I couldn't hide my joy. I prepared thoroughly, packed some bags and waited patiently\
  \ for the main day. Myself and my boss Dr. Steve met at the bus terminal. After\
  \ some swift processes, we were en route. The country side was beautiful with greenery.\
  \ The people along the passing townships emitted some perfect ambiance as some of\
  \ the kids waved at us. We waved back and smiled. The journey was a 6 hour drive.\
  \ I just know i slept through.\n\nVoila! we had arrived. Steve tagged at me. I had\
  \ slept soundly without a care in the world. We exited the bus and grabbed our bags.\
  \ The township was a busy one. There were many people all over, with drivers shouting\
  \ frantically in order to attract passengers. Some taxi drivers forced their way\
  \ into the gathering of just-in passengers. Two of them almost engaged in a scuffle\
  \ just because one claimed the other had snatched his potential client. We grabbed\
  \ our bags and found our way past the commotion. Mina was our host. After multiple\
  \ attempts to reach her, she called back and gave us directions to our hotel. We\
  \ beckoned on a taxi and we were on our way once again. The driver was calm and\
  \ helpful. He talked to us and showed us around. He spoke English and other local\
  \ languages. He told us about when he got to this town and how he started working\
  \ and for how long. We engaged him too. You know how taxi drivers can be very chatty.\
  \ Alas, we were there. A magnificent edifice well situated in the township. The\
  \ environment was serene and at once you knew this is homey. The driver helped us\
  \ with our bags and after taking his fare, he sped off. \n\nWe were in a hurry to\
  \ check out the township so we quickly unpacked, changed and set out one more time.\
  \ This time Mina was around. We went to one restaurant so we can grab some local\
  \ bites. It was well hidden from the usual hustle and bustle of town, but it was\
  \ near a market. We had to queue up and wait for our turn. We ordered the favorite\
  \ delicacy \"fufu\" and goat soup. Halfway in between the meal, there was mayhem.\
  \ We could hear shouts and scattered running. Almost instantaneously, all others\
  \ who were eating in the canteen got up and also started shouting. We didn't understand\
  \ the language. Then Mina explained that they were pursuing a thief. The noise grew\
  \ closer and we washed our hands hurriedly in order to catch a glimpse of the commotion.\
  \ Mina led us to the gathering. Many people had surrounded a 19 year old boy, the\
  \ alleged thief. Some would throw a slap in the middle of the questioning. One elder\
  \ man took it upon himself to do the questioning. The boy was wounded all over.\
  \ He had swollen lips and eyes and he looked lanky. While the women folk were begging\
  \ them to forgive him and let him go, some others insisted on meting out the proper\
  \ punishment - some strokes. We got scared for the boy as Mina told us that some\
  \ thieves get beaten and then burnt alive. That was eerie. Mind you, this isn't\
  \ a 9-1-1 situation. The woman whose phone had been stolen identified her phone\
  \ and took it back. She was asked what she'd like to be done to the lad. She asked\
  \ that they let him go. Some others still wouldn't agree to that. He received some\
  \ few more slaps. Then, immediately a voice shouted from the back. it was a police\
  \ officer. They accompanied the boy to the police station nearby. Then the mayhem\
  \ died. Everyone left as they had come. We enjoyed the spectacle all the same. What\
  \ a way to start our stay in Obuasi. \n\nThe rest of the stay was a mixture of sightseeing\
  \ and medical outreach. It was an amazing experience worth repeating."
