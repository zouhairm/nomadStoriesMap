Text: "I was recommended a visit to Sintra, Located 30 minutes train ride from Lisbon.\
  \ I thought it would be an old town with medieval homes serving best of Portuguese\
  \ food. Which it surely was, but what I didn't expect to find is A Palace! \nPena\
  \ Palace, coloured in bright yellow,red and purple colours, it is said to be holiday\
  \ home of the king! Surrounded by royal gardens for king and queen to roam around\
  \ palace with three different viewpoints located within the garden overlooking Pena\
  \ Palace, this place was one of the best places I've visited across the globe! \n\
  What makes it special is the design of the palace which is quite unique and being\
  \ on hug points you can enjoy birds eye view of Sintra town. The Gardens of Palace,\
  \ filled with pounds and ducks, lots of unique trees provide you with fresh air\
  \ and all the nature. \nAlthough it takes nice two hour walk to the palace itself\
  \ through garden, it is surely an amazing place to get lost. Even with a map and\
  \ if you're carrying bottle of red Portuguese wine and baguette like me, it'll take\
  \ some more time but it will be a memorable lunch spot! \nGoing through each view\
  \ point and looking at the Palace from all the different angles and getting near\
  \ and near to it, you'll be tempted to rush to the Palace. \nAfter going through\
  \ Gardens and View points when you arrive at the Palace, you're greeted with huge\
  \ Gate which was used for elephants to get into the palace! Majestic!! It takes\
  \ at least an hour or more, to go through all the interior and exterior of the palace.\
  \ So colourful as if it's a Disney movie palace coming to life!! \nSeeing it in\
  \ real-life is every bit as amazing as the photos led me to believe. It\u2019s one\
  \ colourful Portuguese masterpiece!\nIt kinda begs the question as to why all other\
  \ European palaces and castles aren\u2019t as colourful as this! (Fine, I know why\
  \ but still\u2026 \U0001F600 ) Maybe it was the wine or it was the colorful castle,\
  \ but that feeling you get once you are the palace is truly the one taking you back\
  \ in time. \nAs you stroll through the palace (which, by the way, is also a castle\
  \ \u2013 palaces were typically built to display wealth, castles were more for defense\
  \ and protection), you can easily see why this is a UNESCO World Heritage site.\n\
  The palace isn\u2019t quite as colourful inside (not that it matters) but is still\
  \ pretty special! (What did surprise me though was how small some of the rooms in\
  \ here were \u2013 I just always assumed they would as big as the palace looked\
  \ on the outside).\nThe palace has so many facets to explore on every side and especially\
  \ at the back, when the setting sun bids us farewell by painting the sky in colors\
  \ of red, it's a treat to see the palace glow in orange shades and see the sun setting\
  \ over the sea! \nI believe visiting Sintra and especially Pena Palace should be\
  \ planned for a day when you're in Lisbon or else the trip to Portugal and Lisbon\
  \ is incomplete without having to see this hidden Gem. \nEventually, we made our\
  \ way back out, thoroughly impressed with Pena Palace and so grateful that it had\
  \ totally made our day special! \nEven though Palace has Caf\xE9 and restaurant\
  \ my advice would be to take Portuguese wine and baguette with you to enjoy your\
  \ sunset and walk through the gardens if Pena Palace."
