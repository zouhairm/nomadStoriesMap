Text: "I keep asking myself what is it, that makes us to who we are? Our ancestors,\
  \ experiences, stories? I started this journey to reconnect with myself. Could his\
  \ story be one of the stories that helps me with it? \n\nI am chilling in a hammock,\
  \ here in paradise \u2013 yes, this is how people call this place. For me it simply\
  \ is one more of these beautiful, Brazilian touristy places. A breath taking, long\
  \ sandy beach, crystal clear blue waters, palm trees and many Caipirinhas shops.\
  \ \n\nI am listing to my favourite chillout music, thinking about the people my\
  \ paths have crossed with and their stories. Most are great at hiding their stories,\
  \ possibly to protect themselves. But sometimes they do open up \u2013 maybe it\u2019\
  s easier to share experiences with strangers - here in paradise.\n\nWe had this\
  \ shallow conversation with these same boring questions when you\u2019re on the\
  \ road. Where are you from? Where have you been? Next destination? \nHe, a mid-twenties\
  \ man from Israel, now traveling for a few months after serving the army. \nI\u2019\
  m super interested in his opinion regarding the current situation. I\u2019m slowly\
  \ approaching and starting to ask questions. He thinks it would be good if Israel\
  \ and Palestine would exist as two different countries. I\u2019m asking how he feels\
  \ about the attacks? His respond is short and on point \u201CIsrael doesn't attack,\
  \ it just defends itself\u201D.\n\nAs the conversation becomes more profound, we\
  \ start talking about his time at the Israeli Navy. Stories such as that they stopped\
  \ a boat that transported hundreds of missiles while the captain didn\u2019t know\
  \ about them. What has happened to those who knew remains unclear\u2026\n\nAs he\
  \ looks like a happy, young man, I'm very interested in how the killing has changed\
  \ him. I feel an inner hesitation to ask. Do I cross a line by asking it? But he\
  \ encourages me to be direct, so I ask: \"How was it like to take a person's life?\"\
  \ He interrupts me, noticing my hesitation and repeats the question more directly:\
  \ \"How is it to kill someone\"? I nod, feeling relieved. A slightly strange feeling\
  \ remains. I'm nervous and curious about his answer. \n\nBefore he responds, he\
  \ points out that as a \u201Chuman being\" he wouldn\u2019t do such things, but\
  \ as a soldier it\u2019s his duty to defend his homeland. He\u2019s responsible\
  \ for the security of his country ... You can literally see how he deeps into his\
  \ thoughts before answering. The first and third time (I feel that there were more\
  \ - I don't ask) it was a strange, woozily feeling in the stomach area. He also\
  \ expresses it with body language in pointing to that area. He continues: Then,\
  \ the whole body is shaking, and you take a deep, deep breath. It is always the\
  \ same feeling after each killing.\n\nI look into his eyes. It\u2019s important\
  \ to see his facial expression, his body posture. Since an answer like this seems\
  \ more intense with body language. For some short moments we did\u2019t have eye\
  \ contact. I can see how he's reviewing events to answer as honest as possible.\
  \ I wasn\u2019t expecting such a detailed description of what was going on in his\
  \ body while taking a human\u2019s life.\n\nWe also talked about how it feels like\
  \ to lose your friends, transporting their bodies, to hand them over to their families,\
  \ standing there, watching how they burst into tears and feelings helpless. Yes,\
  \ they died for their country! \nHe seems like a very positive, open minded person\
  \ that hasn\u2019t lost his positive attitude through these horrible experiences.\
  \ The only time his moods changed was when he talked about children with munition\
  \ on their bodies. That is just too absurd \u2013 he lights his first cigarette\
  \ this evening!\n\nNowadays, he is very committed and wants to change things. He\
  \ plans to go into politics and find a solution to positively end this conflict.\n\
  \nNever judge a book by its cover, never!  I\u2019m grateful for his openness and\
  \ trust. I think about my life, people I met and how they influence us. They surely\
  \ do, every conversation/interaction shapes our own behaviour. How this conversation\
  \ has shaped mine? I\u2019m less judgemental, grateful and more curious. Thank you."
