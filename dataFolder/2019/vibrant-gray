Text: "I took a breath, full and unrestrained. Filling my lungs to the brim with the\
  \ foreign atmosphere. Smells I\u2019d never known. Turmeric. Ghee. Jasmine. Incense.\
  \ Spectacular. My mind, it churned with beautiful things. Henna and silk and buttered\
  \ daal over rice and chapati. Golden jewelry spanning from nose to ear. The charming\
  \ ring of small bells around the ankles of walking women. Excitement forced my heart\
  \ to beat. And oh it beat, matching the rhythm of the Bhangra dance music blaring\
  \ through my driver\u2019s speakers. Already the colors brought joy to my soul,\
  \ and like a lamp, they brightened my view. I was altogether captivated. Reds, deep\
  \ with the ability to romance the eye. The oranges and yellows and pinks. Same like\
  \ the colors of the fading day reflecting over a vast ocean. The moments before\
  \ the world is blanketed in darkness and the colors of fire fill the horizon. Warmth\
  \ lived there. \n\nBut in the same breath, a dark and cold resided also. Musk. Rotted\
  \ trash. Cremating flesh. Urine. Dreadful. Panic flared up within my belly. My thoughts\
  \ were torn to rags. Things I\u2019d heard, movies I\u2019d seen, fears I\u2019\
  d learned. Stories of food sickness, Slumdog Millionaire, and human trafficking,\
  \ all at the forefront of my mind. And oh, the sounds! Car horns and cries of children\
  \ lost in the crowds of people, and cows and motorbikes. Bells of street vendors\
  \ and screams of monkeys. Dust and smog and smoke threatened my lungs. The world\
  \ was grayish-brown and worn out. Where was I? I\u2019d left my world and comfort\
  \ behind. And in a moment my entire being was focused on the hands around me, grabbing\
  \ and begging. Rupees. Food. Clothing. Anything. Overwhelmed. Broken people with\
  \ broken limbs. Sickness and homelessness and wearied faces. Curious eyes full of\
  \ questions and judgments boring into my foreign soul. Who was I? My heart, it broke.\
  \ \n\nAnd upon the exhale, I descended from the auto-rickshaw and took my first\
  \ step onto Indian soil, unsure of what to expect."
