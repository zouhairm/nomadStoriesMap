Text: "Her black skin gleamed in contrast with the hot pink nail color. The shea butter\
  \ gave her skin a rich, glossy complexion. Each of her small fingers felt delicate\
  \ yet strong as I angled them against the nail brush. I looked up from my work to\
  \ see her smiling down at the simple luxury of having a manicure. I smiled back\
  \ and continued painting. I thought about the times I begged my mother to paint\
  \ mine, but she never obliged. I taught myself to give myself the perfect manicure\
  \ and I loved sharing the talent with those I cared for. After a week of volunteering\
  \ at the Creche, I asked the girls if they'd like me to bring my nail polish the\
  \ next time I saw them. \n\nThe creche was located behind a chain linked fence along\
  \ a dirt road. Across the road was a convenience store where several men stayed\
  \ out to drink after work. The property was guarded but I wondered how effective\
  \ it was. On the property were two buildings, a church and the children's living\
  \ quarters.  They were sponsored by the plantation owners where their parents worked.\
  \ The children were orphaned, either by neglect or their parent's bout with AIDs.\
  \ A steady stream of volunteers came on 3 to 6 week contracts and that seemed to\
  \ be their solution for the neglect. \n\nI spent three afternoons a week helping\
  \ with their chores - sweeping the floors, folding laundry, tidying the kitchen,\
  \ or tending the chickens. The chicken coup served as income to cover their school\
  \ costs for uniforms and books. We worked until dinner but I never ate with them.\
  \ I waited until they were done so we could enjoy some free time. They taught me\
  \ Zulu and we practiced English. We played tag or ran around the yard with the chickens.\
  \ They loved to listen to music and most of all they loved to be with me. They enjoyed\
  \ playing with my hair and asking me questions and I'd tell them everything they\
  \ wanted to know. Joy and laughter filled our time together and I thought how wonderful\
  \ it was that with me they got a chance to be children again.  \n\nWhen I was done\
  \ painting her nails, we took turns blowing on each of her hands and she fanned\
  \ them out to quicken the drying process. As she admired her freshly painted nails\
  \ I noticed through her smile that tears streamed down her cheeks. She said something\
  \ in Zulu and the older girl translated. \n\n\u201CShe\u2019s never felt so much\
  \ love.\u201D \n\nShe\u2019s never felt so much love.\n\nI hugged her. I told her\
  \ she was loved. Then we continued our usual evening antics of singing, dancing,\
  \ and gossiping, but that night as I returned home the feeling of unease remained.\
  \ I'd leave in a week and I would never see these children again. The deep affliction\
  \ a short term volunteer causes struck me. I chocked back my guilt and enjoyed the\
  \ rest of my time with the children but I couldn't shake the feeling that all my\
  \ help might have done damage. \n\nOn the plane home, I thought about the hot pink\
  \ nails that would tend to the chickens and I hoped more love found her. I hoped\
  \ the next volunteers would consistently bring more joy and I hoped the next volunteer\
  \ would bring some nail polish remover."
