Text: "Traveling to Cuba means traveling to the past, at least 60-70 years ago, and\
  \ discovering not only its amazing culture and traditions, but also, a country where\
  \ its people is still living offline! They are not connected 24/7 like we do in\
  \ most regions of the planet. \n\nAs Cuba is still a communist country, and giving\
  \ their internal policies, the cubans have very limited access to internet, usually\
  \ in the government offices only. Given so, it is magical to go back to the times\
  \ were connectivity didn't ruled our lives! Having real connections, real conversations,\
  \ meeting authentic people out of filters and photoshop. Going to Cuba has definitely\
  \ been one of the most beautiful experiences I've lived!\n\nI had the opportunity\
  \ to travel alone, and stayed in one of the local houses, meet the local people\
  \ and became friend with them. Cubans are warm good hearted people. They live threatened\
  \ by a government that has used the country's resources in the benefit of a small\
  \ group, delivering in poverty and making the cubans live under very narrow circumstances.\
  \ However, even when they struggle to meet their basic needs every day, they don't\
  \ lose the magic and the sparkle of their caribbean essence. It's unbelievable how\
  \ they are always in a good mood, singing, dancing and welcoming new people to get\
  \ to know more about them and their culture. \n\nCuba is also a must if you are\
  \ into culture and history. Not only its beach, architecture and people are amazing,\
  \ Cuba has a strong historical legacy to be shared. They've been a fighting people\
  \ for decades, and they still don't give up! Despite their economy, Cuba has some\
  \ of the best professional educations in Latin America for its citizens for free,\
  \ so they are well prepared people, looking for an opportunity to improve and become\
  \ better persons and professionals.  \n\nArt has been other of the areas cubans\
  \ have excelled, making this a way of expressing their social situation, creating\
  \ beautiful masterpieces, so if you are into Art, you'll find great local museums\
  \ and markets to delight.\n\nI could never finish of giving you all the reasons\
  \ why you should visit Cuba, but definitely you won't find any other country like\
  \ this!"
