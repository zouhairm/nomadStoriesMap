Text: "I was a bartender in a 2 and a half star Greek restaurant, clocking in 80 hours\
  \ a week, under the dictatorship of a misogynistic boss. Sound dramatic? Yes, but\
  \ true all the same. *heavy sigh trying imagine how to possibly put the debauchery\
  \ that followed in the next 650 words.* \n\nI quit, I walked out the door, I had\
  \ my last straw. Naturally, I pulled up Skyscanner, cause ya girl needed some new\
  \ scenery. And Lima,Peru came up round trip less than 200 dollars, my thumbs moved\
  \ faster than my brain, and I had 2 days to pack for my time in South America. \n\
  \nI flew into Lima with 100 dollars cash, and a couple hundred on my debit card.\
  \ Zero plans made, zero friends on the continent. But I walked into the first airport\
  \ bar I saw so I could get my hands on the oh so acclaimed pisco sour lonely planet\
  \ could not get enough of, and my card was declined. I paid in cash, sipped my drink\
  \ and called the bank immediately. \u201COh sweetheart, you have to come into the\
  \ branch in person to fix that\u201D \n\nI begged and pleaded and cried, but they\
  \ were relentless (and utterly useless) I wasn\u2019t getting any money from that\
  \ account. I wandered into the cold Lima air and sat for what I believe was about\
  \ six hours. Thinking, planning, condemning my impulsivity. In that moment a taxi\
  \ driver pulled up and screamed some location I\u2019d never heard of, but I shrugged\
  \ and sat in the back of the taxi, off to god knows where. \nI must have cried 3\
  \ times during the 15 minute ride, I have never seen terrifying driving the way\
  \ I saw it in Lima, and I still shudder when I think of it today. The driver stopped\
  \ and let me out at the most adorable public park I\u2019ve ever seen and I blinked\
  \ a couple of times before I began looking around the eccentric town. The first\
  \ recognizable location was a hostel, it seemed nice enough so I wandered to reception\
  \ and inquired about volunteer opportunities. \n Sergio, the tall, confident Peruvian\
  \ man demanded, \u201CDo you have bartending experience?\u201D I couldn\u2019t help\
  \ but laugh, thinking Do I ever??? \nThat night I started my new position on the\
  \ rooftop bar making pisco sours and passion fruit chilcanos with the good looking,\
  \ South American bar manager. \nBy the time my return flight date was approaching,\
  \ I had managed to hold on to the 100 dollars I came into the country with, saving\
  \ on drinks and accomodation. I was volunteering at a local English school, and\
  \ spending my nights at the bar with my now boyfriend, Franco. I had met a best\
  \ friend, adopted a dog, and made a daily routine of buying ceviche from the old\
  \ woman across the street. \nWhat business did I think I had going back to Florida?\
  \ \nI walked into the airport to change the departure date on my flight, or cancel\
  \ it all together, when I was informed that I already overstayed my visa. My jaw\
  \ dropped to the floor when the Peruvian airport attendant told me I owed 300 dollars\
  \ USD and had 24 hours to depart the country. \nMy eyes welled with tears and she\
  \ told me in Spanish I could ask the \u201Cnice white family behind me to lend me\
  \ the money\u201D I choked my pride away, and thanks to them I avoided a night in\
  \ a South American prison. I went back to the hostel to collect my things and wrote\
  \ a note to the people who had become family to me, as I knew deep down I would\
  \ not be returning soon to Lima. \nI was \u201Cdeported\u201D by all technicality,\
  \ from a place I still feel homesick for to this day."
