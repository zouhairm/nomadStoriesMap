Text: "It is typical of travellers to narrate their visual treats. Without doubt Ladakh\
  \ is one such destination where no amount of words or photographs can do justice\
  \ to re-creating this magnificent beauty for its audiences. As a matter of fact\
  \ I will let a few adjectives and metaphors in my blog do the talking while I leave\
  \ its interpretations to the reader\u2019s imagination. My narrations of this place\
  \ come packed in the stories I have about my unexpected encounters with humanity\
  \ \n\nIn 6 days of riding expedition, we had our rendezvous with Humanity. While\
  \ I can back this up with a whole bunch of experiences, I will stick to 3.\n1. \
  \      We lived at iJigmet Guest House in Leh, Jigmet being the owner of this place.\
  \ This place is located closer to the market making daily commute easy for a leisure\
  \ traveler. The balcony of the rooms open to a surreal view of snow capped mountains\
  \ at a distance with some sun kissed glitter added to the trees. The Hotel\u2019\
  s own Kitchen garden that grows enough vegetation including an Apple tree roofing\
  \ us while we sipped our evening coffee. Just when we thought we couldn\u2019t have\
  \ asked for more, Jigmet organized this special Ladakhi treat on the last day of\
  \ our stay. The Ladakhi treat by itself was fine but the gesture of hosting it at\
  \ his home took us all by surprise. As Management students, we talk about customer\
  \ satisfaction and delight. Marketing teams in our organizations spend months and\
  \ thousands of dollars in wooing the customers to delight. Failing to realize that\
  \ \u201CDelight\u201D is not always about complicated strategies or Fancy jargons.\
  \ It is much simpler and this act is just an example. \n2.       As fancy as riding\
  \ sounds, aspiring riders must/might also know the hassles of riding on terrains\
  \ like these. This ruggedly masculine grandeur created by diverse landscapes offers\
  \ more adventure than simply riding through unfinished roads. A rider in this topography\
  \ will find himself sinking into the beauty of an everlasting valley on one side\
  \ and humungous mountains absorbing him on the other. S/He may be welcomed by a\
  \ lush green valley of vegetation OR at times a river may be kind enough to graciously\
  \ escort the rider to his/her destination (enroute Drass from Kargil). The rider\
  \ will also have to cross small rivulets that cut across the roads which already\
  \ are rocky. At one such patch one of our bikes was partly submerged in water while\
  \ crossing it. At altitudes like these where even walking becomes a test of your\
  \ stamina, pulling a bullet out of water can be like a task worth some special brownie\
  \ points. While we were figuring out our way of this, a local trespasser was kind\
  \ enough to come for our rescue without even being asked. He perhaps knew we were\
  \ not going to be able to handle it without help. He helped us pull out the monster\
  \ and walked away once the job was done. What was amusing about this gesture was\
  \ the gentleman came in and helped without being asked, with no motive or interest\
  \ of his own and silently walked away like as if he didn\u2019t want to be noticed.\
  \ I am not sure if they are probably used to such scenes OR it is because I am comparing\
  \ it to a typical road accident we would see in one of our Metro and tier 2 Metro\
  \ cities wherein the number of on-lookers is more than even the number of injured\
  \ in the accident, that I am amused. In any case we have something to learn from\
  \ here.\n3.       My last incident is more about people in general (tourists and\
  \ locals) in Ladakh. It was fascinating to watch everyone on the streets exchange\
  \ smiles and hi \u2013 fives without having to know each other. A certain amount\
  \ of unsaid amity was in the air and what\u2019s more\u2026 It\u2019s contagious\
  \ too!!! Language, race, geography \u2013 no bar. Ironically enough at a place that\
  \ has a history of being in socio \u2013 political unrest (Kargil War, Kashmir issue)!\
  \ It came as a pleasant surprise.  A common interest can break the ice and unite\
  \ people\u2026why is Humanity NOT a common interest then?"
