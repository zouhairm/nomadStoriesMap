Text: "As I grew up, my mother had always tried to incorporate her Haitian culture\
  \ into my upbringing. From the food, festivals, church services, and even French\
  \ and Creole lessons, my mother  made sure my sister and I were familiar with our\
  \ Haitian roots. \nHowever, it wasn\u2019t until the summer of 2017 I that was actually\
  \ able to go to the beautiful island of Haiti. I had no idea what to expect, and\
  \ when I arrived it was much better than I had ever imagined.\nEverywhere I looked\
  \ were people who looked like me. As we drove into the capital city of Port au Prince,\
  \ it was difficult not to be distracted by the garbage littered streets. However,\
  \ what caught my eye and held my attention was the busy merchants and their colorful\
  \ vending stands. I was intrigued by the way they conducted business and by what\
  \ they were selling. \nDuring a portion of the trip, I experienced the mountainous\
  \ terrain that encompasses a large amount of Haiti. For twelve hours, I sat in a\
  \ car being tossed about by the gravel path. It was not my favorite part of the\
  \ trip, but definitely memorable. \nI was also able to visit my grandma\u2019s birth\
  \ city and see the land that she had bought in Haiti. We picked ripe mangoes from\
  \ the surrounding trees and my mother and grandma showed us the proper way to eat\
  \ them. Haitian mangoes are definitely the best mangoes I have ever tasted. \nDuring\
  \ my time spent there, I was often mistaken as a native due to the way I look. I\
  \ asked my mother to teach me how to say, \u201CI don\u2019t speak Creole,\u201D\
  \ but the people would often switch to French and continue trying to speak to me.\
  \ Although it was frustrating being unable to understand or speak the language,\
  \ I was able to learn more about a part of myself that I hadn\u2019t paid enough\
  \ attention to. \nThe last few days in Haiti were spent in a beautiful resort on\
  \ the beach. The water was clear and warm and the sand was spotless and white. The\
  \ mountains that we had just drove through days before was visible in the distance,\
  \ and seeing them gave me a feeling of nostalgia. \nWhen my trip to Haiti came to\
  \ end, I was not ready to leave. I wanted to stay longer and explore the culture\
  \ and the food. However, I know that I will go back again."
