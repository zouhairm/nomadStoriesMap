Text: "Hello.\n\n I was born in a family of 5 children. All my siblings died when\
  \ I was still young, and my father also passed away after them. \_My mother left\
  \ our house, and she wanted to take me with her of course. But my father\u2019s\
  \ family refused, and they instead took me to live with another woman. I spent a\
  \ horrible childhood in her house, where I was abused, but I am trying not to cry\
  \ today, so I will not tell you details about that.\n\_\nI had never had happiness.\
  \ So when I was 16, I got married. I thought marriage was the only thing that was\
  \ finally going to make me happy, change my life. I had an amazing husband, and\
  \ I loved him. But just after we had our first son, he came up with this idea that\
  \ we could get rich fast if we went to witchcraft. I refused, but he said he wasn\u2019\
  t going to change his mind. So I had no choice other than leaving him, and going\
  \ back to my grandmother\u2019s.\n\_\nShe then forced me to marry another\_man,\
  \ much older than me (in his fifties). He had just chased away his wife, the third\_\
  one by the way, and so, I was the forth.\n\nJust when I was pregnant with my first\
  \ baby, he started abusing me. He started beating me up quite many times. And when\
  \ I told my grandmother, she told me \u201CCome on! That is how men are, it is going\
  \ to go away\u201D So I kind of got used to that.\n\n\nWe then had 3 more children\
  \ together, all girls. I then started telling myself that, maybe he is not happy\
  \ with the fact that I only \u201Cgive him\u201D girls. Then I was pregnant of my\
  \ fifth child, and things got even tougher. As I wasn\u2019t working anymore, he\
  \ started bringing no more food for us. He just ignored me completely, like I was\
  \ not there anymore, yet that is when I needed him most.\n\_\nThe night when I gave\
  \ birth, he came home and I told him that I really needed to go to the hospital.\
  \ He didn\u2019t reply me but instead went to his room and locked himself in. I\
  \ ran to my friend\u2019s house, and told her how things were. She then took me\
  \ to the hospital. Thank god the delivery went very well. But I had no money and\
  \ hospital bills needed to be paid. So my friend\u2019s husband went to my husband\
  \ to tell him that I gave birth to a boy. I was telling myself that, as this time\
  \ it is a boy, maybe he is going to be happy for me. Maybe things are going to go\
  \ well with us. But all he did is that he gave money to my friend\u2019s husband,\
  \ and never even bothered to come to see his baby.\n\n\_\nI  had no choice other\
  \ than just leaving him. I rent a one room house where we stayed for quite some\
  \ time. I had nothing, and I had no one. An empty room, with my hungry children\
  \ on my sides. My heart was broken and I thought about suicide so many times. But\
  \ when I looked at my children, I could not. \n\nI later on was admitted in a women\
  \ promotion project, and there I was supported to start a small business. I knew\
  \ I had to wisely manage the profit that I was getting. Little by little things\
  \ started to get better. Now, I am able to satisfy all our primary needs as a family,\
  \ and last year, I was able to start building my own house, which is in its final\
  \ stages now.\n\n\nI have never been any happier in my life than I am now. I will\
  \ never marry again. I think I have had enough with marriages. My children are my\
  \ happiness now. I do my best to provide them with what they need. They all go to\
  \ school now, and my only goal in life now is helping them to become autonomous\
  \ and important people.\n\nMy name is Laina."
