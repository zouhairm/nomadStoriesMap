Text: "We both lost the bus, for different reasons, but we lost it. It was a quarter\
  \ to five in the afternoon and you were there, wearing your winter hat and putting\
  \ on your gloves. It's cold outside, you told me, it's always cold in the afternoon.\
  \ At five o'clock it closes this place where now we shelter from the cold English\
  \ evening and we have to wait outside for another bus to pass.\n\nYou went out in\
  \ front of the station, while I held the door still absorbed in my thoughts and\
  \ focused on my mobile phone, my trip was long and I was angry because I would also\
  \ lose the reservation of my train to Oxford. You started asking me where I was\
  \ from, what I was doing, and I with my common attitude of avoiding people I gave\
  \ short and direct answers to somehow make you understand that I wanted to end the\
  \ conversation. My eyes went once more to the phone, the terrible connection in\
  \ the centre of the city. We both exhaled smoke from the cold and humidity, but\
  \ you still talked to me.\n\nOnly the two of you sitting on a bench in the station,\
  \ you told me about your daughter, about your granddaughter, about how has a lot\
  \ of housemates, how hard and expensive life is, and I began to observe you, the\
  \ wrinkled features of your forehead, the listening device in your ear, the hands\
  \ rubbing together to preserve the heat, and I began to listen to you. \n\n-Let\
  \ me lay down on this tree, being sitting down kills me. I used to play golf but\
  \ that he can not even do it for this damn sick leg. Years do not pass by unnoticed,\
  \ he tells me as he seeks to settle against the tree while holding his suitcase.\n\
  \nFor a moment I forgot everything, that I had lost the bus, the money for the next\
  \ train and I listened to you for almost an hour. We were shaking because of the\
  \ cold and I asked you about your route and your daughter, why were you travelling\
  \ that night. Adjusting the hearing device and partly trying to understand my bad\
  \ English accent told me that he missed her so much and that was a mutual feeling\
  \ since she visited him frequently since his wife died.\n\n-Today is two years after\
  \ her death, the house is not the same without her. My daughter visited me recently\
  \ and was surprised at how clean and tidy everything was. More than fifty years\
  \ together. \n\nThe station has been filled with people, the bus has more than forty\
  \ minutes late. \n\n-The only thing I would have liked is to leave before her. When\
  \ we were young we lived in London, but then we got married, we had children, we\
  \ came to live here. It's close but it's not the same. You know that even in animals\
  \ when they mate for life when one dies the other dies almost at the same time.\n\
  \nI could not contain a tear finally poking out, quickly wiping it so he would not\
  \ notice it, and although in almost an hour he seemed to age, I told him that he\
  \ was still strong. He looked at me, took off his hat and said, yes, but I do not\
  \ have her \u2026\n\nThere was a short silence with a bittersweet taste, both with\
  \ clouded eyes as the bustle of the street grew around, the people desperate because\
  \ the bus was not arriving, and we were talking with the time stopped. \n\n-Fall\
  \ in love, he finally tells me, there is nothing better than having a travel companion\
  \ in this life. Lying still with his back against the tree, he takes the suitcase\
  \ back in his hand and tells me he is going home.\n-It's too cold I'll go to London\
  \ tomorrow. Have a good journey, he tells me ... and I, still looking like a fool,\
  \ only manage to answer, \"You too.\"\nHe smiles at me, takes his suitcase and walks\
  \ away. Two minutes later the bus arrives."
