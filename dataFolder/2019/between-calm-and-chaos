Text: "Ah Morocco, such a sensual and contrasting country. In the streets our strange\
  \ faces are greeted by smiles and a lovely \u201Cwelcome.\u201D Where the Riads\
  \ and Dars (traditional houses) are an orange blossom and rose petal oasis amidst\
  \ the hum of the medinas. Perceived time slows down. Everything happens \u201CInshallah\u201D\
  \ which translates directly as \u201CGod willing,\u201D but sometimes means \u201C\
  Likely never.\u201D I\u2019ve found it\u2019s really best not to fight it or you\u2019\
  ll find yourself ground down to inevitable submission. And when you decide to return\
  \ to Morocco, you\u2019ll realise you came back to relax in the frenzy.\n\nThe first\
  \ time I traveled the country, my older sister had just moved to Ifrane, a quaint\
  \ Northern town straddling the edge of the Atlas mountain range, 5400ft high. Think\
  \ Moroccan Alps with monkeys. One day off, we decided to visit Azrou, a neighbouring\
  \ town where there was a school for carpet weaving and handicrafts. The Government\
  \ of Morocco has done a great job of preserving Moroccan traditions by housing and\
  \ teaching women the traditions of the craft. We arrived at the school, which was\
  \ closed for the day, and since my sister had to go into work, I decided to come\
  \ back on my own time.\n\nThe next day I was dropped off in the early afternoon\
  \ at a grand taxi station for my solo adventure. Grand taxis are different than\
  \ petit taxis in that they\u2019ll take you from town to town. It\u2019s such a\
  \ Moroccan thing to stuff too many passengers or animals into a taxi or truck and\
  \ I was keen to join into the local custom. When I got in, a lovely and robust Arab\
  \ woman said to me, \u201CIt\u2019s ok, you can put your arms around me.\u201D I\
  \ was quite relieved at her graciousness, looking at the 6 other people shoved into\
  \ this tiny, old, rusty green Mercedes. \n\nA man in the front seat took notice\
  \ of me right away, and then started in on marriage proposals and how many camels\
  \ he\u2019d give for me (it was 3). After the initial thrill of the trip, about\
  \ 20 minutes into the drive, I wanted out. When I exited the car in Azrou, I felt\
  \ like all eyes were on me. After all, it is the main square and grand taxi stand,\
  \ so I imagine it was some of the local\u2019s best people watching part of town.\
  \ \n\nStanding in the busy square I tried as much as possible to pretend I knew\
  \ where I was going (I didn\u2019t). A handsome man walked up to me right away and\
  \ asks me, \u201CDo you speak English? I study film at the University of Meknes\
  \ and want to practice.\u201D His name is Hamza, he looks more African than Arab,\
  \ with a button nose and non-ironic hipster style. He\u2019s about 10 years younger,\
  \ none the wiser but very sweet. \u201CDo you want to go to see the market? It will\
  \ be easier with me,\u201D he says, and he\u2019s right. \n\nThe market magically\
  \ appears on Wednesdays with rows and rows of blankets laid on the ground. The stalls\
  \ are filled with fresh fruit and veggies, trinkets and clothing. Hamza leads me\
  \ through the maze and picks out some oranges while I stop to take photos. I explained\
  \ to Hamza that I was there specifically to find a carpet, so he offers, \u201C\
  Let\u2019s climb the mountain to see the view, and then I can take you to the school.\u201D\
  \  \n\nWe walked up behind the town, through favela-style houses with miles of hanging\
  \ laundry, big angry dogs and shepherds herding their flocks. We found a quiet spot\
  \ and sat above the village. Hamza tied his cheche, a light indigo coloured scarf\
  \ used to block out the wind, over my hair and face. We laughed at my Canadian/Berber\
  \ style and sat admiring the vast expanse of Atlas mountain range.\n\nWatching the\
  \ people and the bustle below reminded me again of the duality in this country between\
  \ calm and chaos. I\u2019d also thought about the risk I took climbing the mountain\
  \ with Hamza, but the rush of seeing something so beautiful and unique to Morocco\
  \ in such an authentic way was too great to pass on."
