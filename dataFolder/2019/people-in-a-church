Text: "I always enjoy visiting churches whenever I'm abroad, I feel like the interior\
  \ in itself is a work of art, the slow stride of visitors and tourists, all with\
  \ their cameras in hand, making sure not to make too much noise as to not disturb\
  \ the saints and the angels is a calming experience.\n\nDuring my semester aboard\
  \ in Copenhagen, I tried to widen my horizons, I tried to say yes to any and all\
  \ plans, not wanting to limit my experience in any way. During the weekend my friends\
  \ and I would usually go to a bar, enjoy a few drinks and talk about our cultures\
  \ and our different backgrounds, a topic that surprisingly would never get old.\
  \ \n\nOne weekend, near the end of my stay, when I would reflect a lot on my time\
  \ away from home and what this short but vital journey had taught me, I decided\
  \ to spend Friday night by myself, walking through downtown Copenhagen, taking in\
  \ my surroundings. \n\nI found myself standing in the December cold of Copenhagen,\
  \ in awe of the huge building before me, the half dome and the tower at the end\
  \ made me want to step inside, I was in Our Lady's Church. Little did I know that\
  \ this would be one of the most memorable nights of my life.  \n\nThe thing that\
  \ strikes me most about my visits to churches is that the most churches have the\
  \ same smell. This time, I could smell the church while standing on the gravel road\
  \ ten feet away. I inhaled the odor of sanctity so familiar to churches. That perfect\
  \ mix of oils, candles and a hint of flowers, a smell that's heavy and makes your\
  \ eerily aware of your sins, yet wanting to purify yourself by sitting in the pew,\
  \ looking up at huge statue of Jesus Christ and just thinking about redemption.\n\
  \nI walked into the red-lit church, surprised to find people everywhere - it was\
  \ packed. They also weren't your typical church goers, they weren't sitting in the\
  \ rows like you'd expect to see them during Sunday mass, they were everywhere. They\
  \ were on the floor, sleeping and sitting. They we standing or swaying form side\
  \ to side. But what caught my attention wasn't the size of the crowd but what they\
  \ were doing. Some were crying, others were smiling; some were meditating while\
  \ others were very still, looking up at the ceiling, you could see they were lost\
  \ in wonderment. \n\nBut they all had one thing in common. Everyone was silent;\
  \ even if they were there as a group, they respected the sign outside that said\
  \ \"don't speak, just listen to the music.\" And I loved every minute of it.\n\n\
  Before I even realized it, I had spent two hours there; not speaking, just listening\
  \ to the different types of music that filled all corners of the church. I could\
  \ see how the power of music and how it touched everyone differently."
