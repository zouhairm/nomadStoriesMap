Text: "The silent village suddenly wondered where this sound is coming as we entered\
  \ with our bullet. They welcomed us with a sweet smile. We realized What sadam,a\
  \ policeman told us was true when we saw that the beauty of nature was increasing\
  \ as we cover distance. This is a story of our visit to gurez , a paradise in India...\n\
  We opt a house boat stay in Dal lake when we reached Srinagar. The moment we reached\
  \ there we were searching for some good internet connection so that we could plan\
  \ our 4 day stay there. We were extremely happy when the house boat owner shared\
  \ the wifi password. We took Kashmir travel guide and started googling places to\
  \ travel. It showed pahalgam, sonamarg etc... We saw some pictures of one place\
  \ which is 130 km away from Srinagar called gurez valley. When we asked our boat\
  \ owner he said it is too much risky to travel there because of the militants presence.\
  \ The moment we heard the word risk we decided to go there. We went to bus station,\
  \ taxi stand etc but no one agreed us to take there. From there we went to one bullet\
  \ renting guy named basharat. He was super excited to hear about our trip plan to\
  \ gurez valley. He said take one bullet and just go , \"you will cross through militant\
  \ areas, you will see machine guns welcoming you, you will see serious faces of\
  \ soldiers, you will meet some innocent souls there\" bashrat continued.\nWe started\
  \ our journey next day morning itself. Some of the things bashrat said was right\
  \ but some other things was really really different. We received morning wishes\
  \ from machine guns and as we continued we were asked to stop for military checking.\
  \ In our mind a soldier there will be so serious, so we were also serious in our\
  \ look. But we got amazed to hear that friendly talk from soldiers. When we said\
  \ we are from Kerala they were so happy because we are from the other extreme end.\
  \ Yeah Kashmir to Kerala India is one. They offered a coffee and we said no thanks.\
  \ They become serious at that point of time and They said you will go forward only\
  \ after experiencing our care and love because you are our guest. That sentence\
  \ made us agreeing them. We had coffee from the hands that save india. We continued\
  \ our journey after having coffee and biscuits. It took more than 8 hours to finish\
  \ 130 km as we went off-road more. \nThe next thing we experienced was the beauty\
  \ that we were searching for so long. We saw a silent village in front of us...\
  \ The villagers welcomed us with a sweet smile. We reported our presence at gurez\
  \ police station and had a good conversation with the inspector. He send a police\
  \ officer with us to find a good stay. He arranged the stay at the guest house.\
  \ A sweet and beautiful stay near kishan ganga river. Where ever we looked gave\
  \ peace in our mind. \nNext day we took our bullet and started our journey to see\
  \ line of control. On our way we crossed a mystic village called chorwan. We saw\
  \ few kids waving hands at us. We couldn\u2019t resist these teeny-tiny eyes staring\
  \ at us while we were riding casually through chorwan. Their glowing smiles, fun\
  \ filled actions and surprised look made us stop there for a chat, which actually\
  \ turned into a lovely few hours with them , warm welcome to their house and a cup\
  \ of tea and snacks filled with warmth and love of their whole family. This family\
  \ like any other family in Gurez, didn\u2019t even hesitate a second to treat us\
  \ like one of them. Humans who only learned to spread love, that\u2019s what we\
  \ saw in Gurez. \nThe main trip planned was Srinagar to Manali bike ride but after\
  \ visiting gurez we realized that this is going to be the highlight of our trip.\
  \ Gurez valley is a place less people travel so it is so clean and neat. I hope\
  \ people who visit this place in future will keep it clean and neat."
