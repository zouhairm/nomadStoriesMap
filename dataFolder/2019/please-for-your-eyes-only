Text: "I thought Meteora would have been a meteor impact crater. I was far from correct.\n\
  \ \u201CAt first we had twenty four monasteries. For certain construction materials\
  \ were brought there manually,\u201D briefed Foivos, an old-friend turned local\
  \ guide, whilst pointing far as we began our hike. Ha!\n\u201CNow only six are left,\
  \ and still settled; four for the male monks and two for the nuns.\u201D\n\nMeteora\
  \ was not entirely added to my itinerary by choice.\nThe last three days I had quenched\
  \ my thirst towards ancient Greek mythology; revisiting Zeus in Acropolis and Apollo\
  \ in Delphi and binge snacking on spanakopita \u2013 spinach pastry. I was that\
  \ typical tourist (with fan-girl attitude) from Jakarta, so Foivos initiated an\
  \ adventurous intermezzo.\n\nMy head tilted up every once in a while, paying attention\
  \ to shades of coral and terracotta which stood out among vegetated gigantic sandstones\
  \ and clear blue sky.  Birds were chirping along mumbles in indistinctive languages,\
  \ and within one narrow bridge plus two hundred stair steps later, we arrived at\
  \ the Monastery of Varlaam; the second largest but according to Foivos is most likely\
  \ to be favored by first-timers. \n\nThe main building \u2013 Eastern Orthodox church\
  \ per se - was majestic itself, overlooking such breathtaking landscape where I\
  \ noticed some visitors posed victoriously, raising their arms, on top of less tall\
  \ plateau. Worth an activewear commercial (has anyone done it?) or simply an Instagram\
  \ post. Without the presence of inscribed-crosses endowing the church gate, I might\
  \ mistake this fa\xE7ade for one belongs to beautiful Mediterranean villas: traditional,\
  \ but grande. Mezzanine porch? Checked. Wooden benches and dwarf conifers? Snapped.\
  \ Circular patio? Lounged. \n\n \u201CExcuse me,\u201D a middle-aged man, wearing\
  \ piped velvet cloak approached calmly as I reached out my phone; just about to\
  \ treasure decorative relics from Late Byzantine in digital format. \u201CNo photos\
  \ inside\u201D. I apologized, in awe, wondering; did I just meet one of Varlaam\u2019\
  s seven remaining monks? Wow. Or he\u2019s a staff? Still wow. \u201CPlease, for\
  \ your eyes only.\u201D then he nod me goodbye.\n\nFoivos, upon his frequent visits\
  \ taking other friends from all over the world, already slipped on his own and waited\
  \ at the church exit. Prior leaving he suggested a mandatory clique pic with the\
  \ backdrop of another monastery on slightly taller cliff \u2013 it is okay to take\
  \ pictures in the churchyard. \n\u201CYou see? For your eyes only?\u201D I questioned,\
  \ \u201Cwhy is ev\u2026-,\u201D and within the same second he showed his phone screen;\
  \ displaying search results of Roger Moore in such familiar scenery, and movie posters\
  \ bearing 007 pictoral logo. Ha!\n\u201CAh yes! That For Your Eyes Only!\u201D.\n\
  Some great journeys happen when you least expected (and Googled) it.\nHappened to\
  \ me with solitude, 400 meters above the sea level.\n\u201CRical, you tired already?\u201D\
  \ I didn\u2019t respond to Foivos verbally. Instead I mimic a handgun, point shooting\
  \ at the tall cliff behind him."
