Text: "I always felt attracted to North Africa, its culture, its landscapes. Years\
  \ ago, I spent a whole of September in Tunis, in the Sahara Desert and in the city\
  \ of Tozuer, placed in an oasis at the border with the desert. However, visiting\
  \ Marrakech has been my greatest dream for a long time. I was very curious about\
  \ the fusion between ancient and modern, and the crossing of ethnicities, languages\
  \ and cultures: Arab, Berber and sub-Saharan, the mixture of social, economic and\
  \ religious entities. When I found out a friend of mine just moved to Marrakech,\
  \ I suddenly realized that the time had come to organize my trip; I arranged it\
  \ in a few days.\n\nIn the Medina, there are no road signs, direction of travel,\
  \ traffic lights, stops and other signage: people just find their narrow spaces\
  \ to slip in, apparently at random, even though there must be some non-written rules\
  \ I don\u2019t know yet. People move so harmonious, proud and sure in this confusion.\n\
  When I arrived at the Sun of Kech Riyadh, Hicham kindly welcomed me. He\u2019s my\
  \ friend\u2019s husband. He offered me an excellent mint tea, as by tradition. He\
  \ explained that the teapot must be kept high on the glass, and \u201Cif there is\
  \ no froth, then it\u2019s not a good tea\u201D. Icham and I talked about the city\
  \ and his idea to give a new life to the Riyadh, and I took the chance to rest and\
  \ delight a delicious tea.\nOne hour after my arrival, my Italian friend Chiara\
  \ arrived and gave me some important information to start going around the city:\
  \ a detailed city map and the important places not to miss. When you have some clear\
  \ points of reference, it seems quite simple to walk in the Medina, but as I said\
  \ before, there are no road signs, traffic lights, names on the streets, or even\
  \ streets, actually.\n\nIn Marrakech you must get lost. After the first while, I\
  \ suddenly decide to put my map in my pocket and simply go around: Medina is a real\
  \ labyrinth where you\u2019d better follow your instinct, or just use your map to\
  \ ask information to somebody who knows the city. From the second day on, I kept\
  \ the map in my pocket, loving to get lost in the souk. My Riyadh is located in\
  \ the Medina, and I mainly went around in this area, literally getting lost in smaller\
  \ streets, souks, till the Jamaa El Fna square, the most famous. You should not\
  \ miss it out during your first visit in Marrakech. In the early morning hours,\
  \ Jemaa el Fna turns into a lively fruit and vegetables market. Mid-morning, the\
  \ market quickly disappears and the square gets full of snake charmers and street\
  \ artists: storytellers, dancers, painters, jugglers, henna tattoo artists; you\
  \ can even buy teeth. If you are not interested in buying, do not care about these\
  \ people, they are not there for free. Travelers are often exhausted by merchants\u2019\
  \ pressure, but that\u2019s the way to trade in Marrakech. Let yourself get involved\
  \ by these people: if you lose 5 or 30 minutes for a talk, a tea, they will share\
  \ beautiful stories with you. Young people will surprise you (all speak English\
  \ and French) with their way modern way of thinking. \n\nI recognized the importance\
  \ of \u201Cgetting lost\u201D in the Medina, as well as the importance of being\
  \ wary and to say \u201Cyes\u201D or \u201Cno\u201D, even when talking to the same\
  \ person. I saw all I could, I walked till I got blisters on my feet, I talked to\
  \ anyone could give me any information. And that was not enough. \u201CMorocco:\
  \ love it or hate it\u201D, I was told at my arrival. I didn\u2019t fully catch\
  \ what they meant, but I truly intended to figure it out. In the first days I had\
  \ missed the point, but I still didn\u2019t decide now, I loved it and hated it,\
  \ and still don\u2019t know why. I will be back to clear up my mind, but I am sure\
  \ about the feeling I brought back to Italy."
