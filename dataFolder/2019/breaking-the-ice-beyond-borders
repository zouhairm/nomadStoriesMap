Text: "When I booked my ticket to Paris to celebrate my fortieth, I didn\u2019t want\
  \ a tourist experience.  I had no official plan for the month, except to meet some\
  \ locals and immerse myself in all things \u201Coh la la.\u201D\n\nI suppose because\
  \ I\u2019m both the kind of person who likes meeting new people and someone with\
  \ a history of humorous misadventures, it shouldn\u2019t come as a surprise that\
  \ within an hour of arrival, both of these qualities converged into a fortuitous\
  \ kurmuddle\u2026.actually, it was the access gates of the metro that converged\
  \ onto my suitcase with vice-like force and my reluctance to spend a month in Paris\
  \ without a change of undies that precipitated the call for help and led to my making\
  \ friends quite quickly.\n\nSince the lovely couple of first responders were unable\
  \ to pry the doors off my suitcase, I recruited a crowd of burly men who were hot\
  \ on their trail.  With ten arms, we managed to liberate the luggage.  (Tip for\
  \ the uninitiated: roll your suitcase through first).  The thank you\u2019s led\
  \ to a conversation with the group, who turned out to be Canadians too.  Coincidentally,\
  \ the following day, while on my way to buy a SIM card at the Orange boutique, I\
  \ bumped into the guys on rue de Rivoli.  Paris is big, but not so big!\n\nThe local\
  \ SIM card with data pass allowed me to navigate the city on foot using Google Maps,\
  \ which also led me to meet French people who mistook me for one of their own and\
  \ would stop to ask me directions.  Step one of my French immersion complete.  Je\
  \ parle fran\xE7ais!\n\nWith my new connectivity, I took advantage of dating apps\
  \ to fill my afternoons and evenings with social interactions.  I\u2019m sure I\
  \ saw a side of Paris that I wouldn\u2019t have seen otherwise.  One evening I was\
  \ invited to a cool Absinthe bar called La F\xE9e Verte and another evening L\u2019\
  Entre Potes, which is a cosy French interpretation of an American dive bar.  With\
  \ other people I met on the apps, I visited various caf\xE9s and brasseries and\
  \ saw an exhibition to the Pompidou. \n\nSome of the most memorable encounters happened\
  \ when I went out alone.  One evening I got chatting with a fellow in a bar in the\
  \ Marais who invited me another day to a speak-easy style cocktail bar called the\
  \ Candelaria (cool place).  Another evening I met a couple of French fellows while\
  \ sitting at the bar of a restaurant waiting for my date.  When my date arrived,\
  \ we all got talking together and the French friends invited another Dutch friend\
  \ who was passing through town.  It was one of those spontaneous evenings that magically\
  \ happened.  Other times, I met people when I went out to hear live music at places\
  \ like the Duc des Lombards, le Caveau des Oubliettes or L\u2019Atelier Charonne\
  \ (where I met a French bartender who was about to move to my home town of Vancouver).\n\
  \nThe most surprising night was my 40th birthday.  It was a chilly Monday night\
  \ in November and I decided that evening I would test my luck and venture out alone\
  \ again.  After chatting with a friendly businessman from the C\xF4te d'Azur at\
  \ an Australian bar called the Lizard Lounge, I enjoyed the rest of my wine and\
  \ resigned myself to calling it a night.  As I was putting on my coat, I was invited\
  \ for a drink by a fellow who\u2019d been sitting at the bar with his friends. \
  \ I accepted, since it was my birthday and the night was still quite young (as was\
  \ he at 25), and off we went to begin our birthday circuit.  Later he invited me\
  \ to La Compagnie des Vins Surnaturel (two thumbs up) and soon after on a road trip\
  \ to Brugges\u2026and that\u2019s how my serendipitous trip to Paris began an adventure\
  \ beyond the borders of France.\n\nWhatever it was that called me to Paris that\
  \ autumn (perhaps the wine?) also moved me to immerse myself in French culture,\
  \ to meet wonderful Parisians who remain friends, and to create my own unique memories\
  \ of a beautifully buzzing metropolis.  And the adventure continues\u2026I now call\
  \ Paris home."
