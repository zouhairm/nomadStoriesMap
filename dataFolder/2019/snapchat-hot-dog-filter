Text: "We were sending memes to each other as the S-Bahn train rushed back from the\
  \ airport into town. Thirty-five minutes to Praterstern, then another twenty minutes,\
  \ with the U2, to Hardeggasse. Out of the window, the countryside slowly being replaced\
  \ with suburban apartment blocks, the first streetlights sliding away from my gaze.\
  \ The wagon was deserted. A display of empty seats, camouflaged in their 90s looking,\
  \ bright, woolly seat covers. My green-ish backpack and the robotic voice, n\xE4\
  chste Station: Zentralfriedhof, as only companions. \nShe sent me a selfie of herself\
  \ going through the security check, I answered with a video of myself acting dramatic,\
  \ wiping imaginary tears, singing in the empty train, this is the end, my only friend,\
  \ the end.\nWe both had arrived on the 13th of July, but my scholarship covered\
  \ four weeks of german courses, while she was to leave after three weeks. I never\
  \ thought it was going to be that big of a deal: three weeks together seemed like\
  \ a huge time, and the fact that it only took us two days to decide I was moving\
  \ to her college room comforted us with the idea that we hadn\u2019t lost a single\
  \ minute. The host family I had been assigned to (college rooms in the city centre\
  \ were too expensive for me) watched me as I came and went, basically sponging off\
  \ meals and speaking as much german as I could to keep myself in practice. I think\
  \ they liked me. In my defence: I\u2019d always do the dishes, and I brought dessert,\
  \ a couple of times.\nPlane\u2019s about to take off sweetie, text you when I land\
  \ home.\nThe entire S-Bahn ride was perfectly fine, in the sense that I didn\u2019\
  t start crying until I reached Praterstern station. There I started sobbing, a cadence\
  \ I kept until I reached Donaumarina station, where we once had spent a sunday evening\
  \ on the riverside, the sun fading and mirroring in the Danube, just as clich\xE9\
  \ as it can get. That\u2019s where I started crying, like, real crying.\nI got home\
  \ and my host mother was surprised to see me around at a time that was too late\
  \ for dinner and definitely too soon for breakfast. \n\u201CWhat are you doing here?\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CGuten Abend Frau Berger, I don\u2019t even know anymore\u201D.\nWhen,\
  \ one hour later, she texted me \u201CGot home - safe and sound - how are you?\u201D\
  , I would have loved to answer \u201Cthis whole city makes no sense without you\u201D\
  \ but I thought, and I still think, that would have been just a tiny bit over the\
  \ top. \nI sent her a video of myself dancing to the Snapchat hot dog filter, instead."
