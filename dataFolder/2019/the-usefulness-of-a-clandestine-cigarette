Text: "Long sloping roofs of thatched palm tiles glistened in the sun, as if announcing\
  \ that their purpose was more than to just protect the airport, built in the manner\
  \ of other buildings in the region, against the raging monsoon that the state of\
  \ Kerala was famous for. But on that summer day, there was no rain. There would\
  \ be none on the three days I intended to stay. And yet delusionists such as myself\
  \ who had braved this journey in the middle of an arid most March, could fool themselves\
  \ that the glistening served to forewarn their arrival, if not forbid it. But I\
  \ had saved enough money to pay for a trip on my own for the first time, from my\
  \ art-world job and decided in that selfsame delusion that what I needed as respite\
  \ from it was \u2013 more art. \n\nFor a mass congregation of a certain class of\
  \ cool \u2013 the tote bag carrying savants and the white cube kowtowing \u2018\
  artistes\u2019 \u2013 the Kochi-Muziris Biennale proclaimed to be anything but.\
  \ As one rode to any of its venues, typically old trading compounds and colonial\
  \ shipyards in state of chic ruin, peppered along the easily cyclable town of Fort\
  \ Kochi, it was impossible to miss the words \u201CIt\u2019s my biennale\u201D plastered\
  \ on the crumbling patina of walls that bore photographic renditions of everyone\
  \ from the nuns of Santa Cruz Basilica nearby to a doe eyed burqa clad couple, to\
  \ even the Guerrilla Girls. Art events of this large a scale suffer the risk of\
  \ becoming exclusive entry clubs, as they do in Delhi where I live and work long\
  \ gallery hours. But here in one of the last surviving Communist run states of India,\
  \ the biennale dubbed by Anita Dube, the feminist curator of its eighth year edition,\
  \ as \u201CPossibilities for A Non Alienated Life\u201D had found a way to weave\
  \ itself seamlessly into both the life of this historically syncretic town, and\
  \ into the highbrow contemporaneity of art. I suspected there was something warm\
  \ in the air, and that it was not just the March humidity.  \n\nI was less quicker,\
  \ however, to suspect that this great equaliser that is art is what I had come to\
  \ find. Behind the parade ground walls adorned with lithographic prints, the braying\
  \ tones of schoolchildren confirmed that while some were here to see art, some others\
  \ were getting on with the business of the day. Oblivious to the sea of hipsters\
  \ that had suddenly thronged its sleepy streets with their pierced septums and their\
  \ faux vintage typewriters, Kochi was a town that awoke intermittently from that\
  \ slumber; not with indifference but with warmth.\n\nSuch pervasive a sleepy wakefulness,\
  \ was perhaps what prompted me to not buy a ticket to see the installations right\
  \ away. I could always go on a Monday, the weekly free entry day, I told myself.\
  \ Meandering the narrow lanes of Jew Town I headed instead to the Seagull Restaurant\
  \ by the pier. Seated next to me amongst many Ayurveda enthusiasts was an elderly\
  \ Keralan man. Our eyes met half a dozen times and despite noticing that he was\
  \ mildly chatty with the neighbouring tables, the stern look ensured I kept my distance.\
  \ Doing what I always do to discover a new town, I rolled a cigarette and lit it\
  \ clandestinely. I must\u2019ve not noticed the disapproving waiter walk in my direction,\
  \ when the stern Keralan waved to me and motioned I hide my lighter away. \n\nOver\
  \ the next two days I would amble through the Biennale, asking for more respites\
  \ from art than I had begun with. I would dine at the only restaurant in the country\
  \ to still have a waiters\u2019 union. I would lose my bicycle lock and have half\
  \ of that trade union help me look find it. But I wouldn\u2019t have that share\
  \ that all-knowing grimace-wink of the Keralan gentleman again. \n\nI would go back\
  \ to the pier to smoke alone. The sea that was cerulean when I arrived, would then\
  \ become streaked with the orange sun, each hue riding on a wave as if to deliver\
  \ to you your own private glisten, and the knowledge that perhaps some encounters\
  \ are best left brief to learn."
