Text: "The world is calling, epic adventure awaits and I will always answer. \n\n\
  Who knows where the desire to be in a foreign place with no plan and only time came\
  \ from but here we are. \n\nAs a young female it wouldn\u2019t be the first time\
  \ people asked me why I can\u2019t settle down, meet a man, have children and buy\
  \ a house. Many people warn that time is running out to achieve these things. People\
  \ have always questioned my sanity when travelling alone. I never fit into that\
  \ type of life, the life that fits perfectly for some but I have always had a desire\
  \ to do more. There is so many experiences out there, so many new places to see\
  \ and memories to be made. All I can say is I\u2019d rather be with 20$ to my name\
  \ and breathing in every moment of life than to be be working that picture perfect\
  \ 9-5.\n\nGrowing up as a millennial it would be said I have had every opportunity\
  \ handed to me on a silver platter, it hasn\u2019t. I started travelling very early,\
  \ working hard, growing up with a single mother who made sure I had every opportunity\
  \ to see the world outside my small neighborhood and sometimes the small minds that\
  \ lived within its confines. She pushed me to be and individual and supported all\
  \ my crazy plans of where I was headed to next. \n\nI\u2019ve climbed volcanoes,\
  \ watched sunsets that would give you goosebumps, seen temples surrounded by jungle,\
  \  been chased by singing dolphins on sunny day, watched waves crash against cliffs\
  \ so high you thought you might fall forever. \n\nThat first moment where I promised\
  \ myself a life of travelling was sitting in the back of an old land rover, I was\
  \ 17 and had a long day both physically and emotionally exhausted, I had been volunteering\
  \ with World Vision in a small village in Tanzania. Driving down that bumpy dirt\
  \ packed road listening to a old cassette tape playing softly in the background,\
  \ I was trying to process all the things I has seen. Children with HIV/AIDS, mothers\
  \ with babies strapped to their backs walking hours for clean water or medical attention,\
  \ schools full to the seams with children hoping for a better life. The memory still\
  \ gives me chills as the realization set in, the world is such a bigger place than\
  \ my problems of adolescence, fitting in or being accepted in high school. As the\
  \ dirt billowed up into the air and the golden sun set, life went on as people walked\
  \ along side of the road, and then I felt it deep within, the need to truly experience\
  \ life.\n\nThe funny thing is now those people who told me I should settle down\
  \ are saying they are envious of my adventures and living vicariously through my\
  \ travels. They always ask \u201Cwhere to next?\u201D I have dedicated myself to\
  \ travelling and seeing the world through open eyes, taking those experiences along\
  \ with me to the next destination. Every chance I get I'm adding places to the list,\
  \ it doesn't have to be major tourist destinations, off the beaten path has just\
  \ as much appeal to my nomad heart. I could live forever with only my backpack,\
  \ journal and my camera. \n\nLife is about living, many get wrapped up in the little\
  \ day to day things and forget to enjoy what the world has to offer. The things\
  \ I once thought I needed to be happy have melted away and in its place is the desire\
  \ to learn something new, meet amazing people, exploring and making a difference\
  \ along the way. After all these years and over 51 countries later, one thing I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find was peace within myself, the simple joy I feel watching\
  \ the world pass by sitting at a coffee shop. Looking back I might not have had\
  \ the opportunity to view the world with such perspective if I didn\u2019t leap\
  \ outside of my comfort zone. Travel does something to you, it pulls you, inspires\
  \ you, travel can mean something different to everyone but for me it is how I live\
  \ my life one passport stamp to the next."
