Text: "in 2017 I went through a lot. The end of a nine year relationship, working\
  \ three jobs while going to University full time, all while living on my own and\
  \ paying for a car I had just bought. Randomly, one snowy January morning I decided\
  \ to look at flights to the UK. Looking turned into buying and buying turned into\
  \ the beginning of the rest of my life. I booked a two week trip to the UK which\
  \ eventually turned into a short backpack trip in Europe. I was completely unprepared\
  \ for this trip, I didn't even own a passport yet. I had never travelled anywhere\
  \ on my own but shockingly I wasn't scared. \nFast forward to May 2017, I landed\
  \ in London and my adrenaline was through the roof. I took the hour long tube rude\
  \ to Soho which was where my very first hostel experience was going to be. How was\
  \ I going to make friends? Were people going to like me? Would I like them? This\
  \ was my biggest concern, friends. \nOn that trip trip, my first ever solo trip\
  \ around Europe, I made a plethora of friends. Every city I went to, every hostel\
  \ I stayed in, I made new friends and fell in love with new people everyday. I realized\
  \ this was why I travelled and this was going to make me continue to travel. Don't\
  \ get me wrong, I love soaking in the culture of countries I visit, eating the food\
  \ and visiting the historical sites but meeting new people from all over the world\
  \ has become my biggest passion. \nI have been on a few more solo trips since the\
  \ first and have many more planned for 2019. I used to book my trips thinking about\
  \ what I wanted to see and where I wanted to go. I now book my trips so loosely\
  \ hoping I will make a friend to explore with and experience new cultures together.\
  \ Staying in hostels is thrilling. People come in and out everyday. New faces, new\
  \ adventures and new opportunities. Many people don't understand my passion, in\
  \ fact some are even turned off by the hostel life alone. I would give the world\
  \ to turn my passion into my job. To be able to travel full time and meet as many\
  \ people as I can is my dream. It all started from heartbreak and the courage to\
  \ say \"F*ck it!\"."
