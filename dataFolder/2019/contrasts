Text: "Once upon a time, India was called the \u2018Golden Bird\u2019. It was the\
  \ wealthiest land in ancient times before the British invaded it so ruthlessly that\
  \ today it is counted among the Third World countries. It is a country of contrast:\
  \ the extremely rich people live next to some of the poorest. India is an interesting\
  \ country for a traveller in every possible way.\nMumbai is a city in India that\
  \ shows traces of British rule in its architecture. The British architecture is\
  \ a work of art: buildings that have withstood ages of storms, silent spectators\
  \ to the highs and lows of India\u2019s progress. My friend and I were strolling\
  \ in the by-lanes of Mumbai on one lazy afternoon. The street was directly behind\
  \ the Taj Mahal Palace, Mumbai\u2019s most historic hotel. Not only is it an iconic\
  \ building, having opened in 1903, but it is also the place of the terrorist attacks\
  \ that shook India on 26th November,2008. The mighty structure faces the vast Arabian\
  \ Sea, the end of land for a long, long time.\nIt\u2019s ironic, really, how two\
  \ starkly different worlds co-exist in harmony. My friend and I were discussing\
  \ how it would feel to be able to afford to dine in and stay at the Taj, when I\
  \ noticed a poor family of three on the street. The man was lying on the pavement,\
  \ probably for an afternoon nap. The woman sat beside him, with their child, who\
  \ seemed to be around 3 years old. Surprisingly in the woman\u2019s hand was a takeaway\
  \ box, with a large slice of pizza in it. I remember saying to my friend, \u201C\
  Lucky day for her today. Someone was kind enough to give her their leftover pizza,\
  \ possibly even from the Taj.\u201D I wish I hadn\u2019t said it. I wish I hadn\u2019\
  t seen at all, the scene that followed.\nShe picked up the slice in her hand, and\
  \ the very next moment, a crow swooped in from nowhere, took the slice out of her\
  \ hands, and flew away. I couldn\u2019t hear the sound of her heart break, but I\
  \ saw it. I saw it so clearly, on her face, which crumpled in an achingly sad tiny\
  \ smile she gave me as our eyes met for one second, which felt like eons to me.\
  \ I heard a loud sob from around me, and took me a moment to realize that it came\
  \ from within me. My friend steered me away as I started crying, not sure what all\
  \ those tears were for. At that moment I hated everything. I hated the crow for\
  \ snatching her meal. I hated the world for allowing poverty and homelessness and\
  \ hunger to exist. I hated the woman for appearing before me. I hated my friend,\
  \ for telling me to let it go. I hated myself the most. I wasn\u2019t able to do\
  \ anything as I stared at her. I didn\u2019t have any food in my bag. There were\
  \ no affordable food places around. I couldn\u2019t just offer her money. For once,\
  \ money seemed absolutely useless.\nAs people who have had enough to sustain ourselves\
  \ and thrive well, we often tend to take for granted a lot many things that are\
  \ a luxury to a large bit of our population. Because we have enough, we have so\
  \ much more than enough, that letting some go waste does not even make us want to\
  \ feel guilty. I am a food-lover, but I am also very picky about it. This incidence\
  \ knocked me to my senses, and how. It's an issue we all know too well. But it's\
  \ an issue most of us can only sympathize, never empathize with. It's an issue too\
  \ real in its consequences.\nWars aren\u2019t always against other nations. There\
  \ are some wars which exist within, against lack of basic human rights. Wars within\
  \ ourselves, when we feel helpless, but conscious enough to think about what we\
  \ can do to change the situation. Like the war in my mind, before I knew that I\
  \ didn\u2019t really regret being there at that time, because it made a small change\
  \ in my life in a huge way."
