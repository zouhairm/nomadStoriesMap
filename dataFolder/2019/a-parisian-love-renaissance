Text: "It was in the city of love that my parents\u2019 love died. It died somewhere\
  \ among the Parisian streets. Maybe floating over the Seine. maybe weaving through\
  \ the arrondissements. It was a sudden and unexpected death, but it lingered in\
  \ the air.\nBefore its death, my mother and I embraced Paris. We rode bikes around\
  \ Versailles enjoying its grandeur and greenery. We wandered the Louvre and stared\
  \ disappointedly at the Mona Lisa. We ordered Pain au Chocolat from the boulangerie\
  \ around the corner from our apartment near Place de la Republique. \nThen there\
  \ were the boys\u2014the French men\u2014with whom we became infatuated. We searched\
  \ them out; they were easy to find. We lusted over a chiseled boat driver on the\
  \ Seine who hated Paris.  We flirted with a young guide in Saint-Chappelle who corrected\
  \ our elementary French. We attempted inconspicuous photos of as many cute French\
  \ men as we could to imagine a possible romance between a French man and an American\
  \ woman. \nI like to believe it was excess romance we had been consuming that inevitably\
  \ forced the pendulum to shift the other way. Maybe it was the August heat. It happened\
  \ as we were standing in line for the Musee de l\u2019Orangerie, home of Monet\u2019\
  s Water Lilies; the infamous impressionist painting that caused emotional transcendence\
  \ with their colors and brilliance. \nWe were waiting in line outside, flanked by\
  \ the Seine and the Jardin de Tuileries. The line stretched down a pavement path\
  \ far from the entrance. People were waiting in line around us. We were just another\
  \ pair of tourists. \nThe air settled. \nMy mother unleashed the breathless words,\
  \ \u201CI don\u2019t love your father anymore.\u201D \nThe moment broke through\
  \ the air as though shattering my dimension of reality back in America with my fantastical\
  \ dimension in Paris. I was forced to let the two intersect as she spoke on about\
  \ marriage and love and its dissolution between her and my father.  \nOur dimension\
  \ in Paris had mutated our relationship into friendship. I could have acted as a\
  \ friend, how we had acted the whole week, and consoled her and told her everything\
  \ was going to be okay. I could have acted as though we were equals. But I reacted\
  \ like her daughter. Like a child whose illusion of family was splintering. \nIt\
  \ was as though in the first arrondissement, the core of Paris, disorder in my life\
  \ was unleashed by her words spiraling out in Paris through the arrondissements.\
  \ It ran through tainting the facades of the Parisian buildings as it swept by them.\
  \ \nShe and I entered the mus\xE9e absorbing the Picassos and Cezannes and Gaugains.\
  \ I tried to let the artwork separate the collusion of my realities, but to no avail.\
  \ Finally, we entered the infamous room with curved white walls where Monet\u2019\
  s water lilies of Giverny hung. They were blue. Very blue. All I saw was blue. \
  \ \nI should have resented the city where my parents\u2019 love had died. I should\
  \ have left the city believing Paris was nothing but a glitch of my reality that\
  \ did not need to exist back home in America. Paris should have been dead to me.\
  \ \nDespite it all, I had fallen in love. I fell in love enough to avoid the part\
  \ that had broken that day. I fell in love with Paris, French, and the reprieve\
  \ from reality traveling provided. \nSix years later, I did not expect to find that\
  \ what had died was not meant to be immortal. The tradition of marriage was not\
  \ conducive to ever-changing feelings of love. Love between people can fade, wither\
  \ and die. \nSince then, I have fostered a renaissance of my own loves. I study\
  \ French at university. I have lived in two new countries. I hope to one day live\
  \ in a small Parisian apartment in the 4th arrondissement where I can write by the\
  \ sun light with breaks at a caf\xE9 down the street. \nParis is the only true love\
  \ I have ever had. Paris is not the city that celebrates love between two people.\
  \ Love between two people can always die. It is the love between man and city, which\
  \ will always be immortal."
