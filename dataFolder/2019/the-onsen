Text: "My son Gunnar and I took the two-hour bus ride from Takayama Station in the\
  \ Gifu Prefecture to the end of the line. Our destination was the Okuhida Onsen\
  \ and the Shinhotaka Ropeway just a few strides from its\u2019 base. The climb to\
  \ the Japanese Alps was stealthy; the bus navigating curves of road suspended like\
  \ drawbridges over rushing streams thirty feet below. \n\nFrom the bus windows we\
  \ observed the sleepiness of thatched-roof minka; \u201Chouses of the people\u201D\
  , their window blinds drawn. Clutches of maple bushes and rows of wasabi were soon\
  \ replaced by mint-green moss slick on boulders, and barren trees heaving across\
  \ the road. \n\nWe were off-season, visiting the onsen in late July. I had put it\
  \ at the top of my travel list to Japan: do an onsen, however it\u2019s done. I\
  \ had read about tattoos, ubiquitous in the U.S., but banned in most onsens. Tattoos\
  \ were viewed as, at minimum anti-social, and at worst, gangster-related. My tattoo\
  \ was insignificant, I decided. A small olive-green and black headed finch, pecking\
  \ at something near my tailbone. \n\nThe hotel staff greeted us solemnly, as if\
  \ we were late to the first act of a play. It was so quiet in the 1970s-era carpeted\
  \ lobby we could almost hear the echo of other guests\u2019 slippers down the hall.\
  \ The Ropeway it seemed, was under repair, and we would only be able to take it\
  \ halfway up Shinhotaka. Gunnar displayed extreme and comical disappointment at\
  \ this news, shaking his head and wending his arms around my middle like a three-year-old.\
  \ He had just turned 18. \n\nWe unloaded our backpacks on the tatami mats in our\
  \ room and walked the short path to the Ropeway ticket booth. The cool air around\
  \ us was tight and crisp. The afternoon sun patted the mountain peaks above us like\
  \ a doting grandparent. Inside the gift shop we picked up overpriced sake, sweets\
  \ and other sundries, pushed at t-shirts and jackets on the racks. The clerks left\
  \ us alone.\n\nIn the lift, it was just us, and a young Japanese couple and their\
  \ daughter. The little girl swayed along with the ventricular, as if in a playground\
  \ swing. Occasionally she would launch against her parents\u2019 legs holding on\
  \ as to a pole on the subway, one eye lingering on Gunnar and me. The parents ignored\
  \ her, as well as the snow dotted peaks behind us as we ascended. They were fixated\
  \ on each other, their eyes flickering gold and black in the summer light. \n\n\
  I turned to watch the mountain rolling out behind us like a carpet of twine and\
  \ dry grasses. There was so little snow.\n\nIt was customary, we discovered, to\
  \ wear the kimonos and slippers provided by the hotel, always, like a lazy weekend\
  \ in one\u2019s pajamas. After observing several guests venturing to the dining\
  \ room that night for dinner so attired, we showed up for breakfast the next day\
  \ in our own navy-blue kimonos patterned with a flock of cranes. The breakfast was\
  \ advertised as \u201Ca morning meal that\u2019s both delicious and gentle on the\
  \ body\u201D, I suppose to not upset the delicate state of restfulness one has achieved\
  \ in the Japanese hot spring known as the onsen. Gunnar and I had separated ways\
  \ the evening before; he to the male side and I to the female. We read carefully\
  \ the instructions for onsen etiquette posted discretely on several walls, accentuated\
  \ with cartoon-like drawings. \n\nThe onsen was a mix of indoor and outdoor spaces\
  \ (roten-buro). As I rested nude against a warm rock, my sore traveler\u2019s feet\
  \ soaking in the warm water, I had the sense of being inside a giant fish tank,\
  \ flora and fauna rising through the mist.\n\nLater that day I sat on the futon\
  \ in our room with a cup of tea, looking up towards Shinhotaka. I saw  Gunnar exit\
  \ the front door of the hotel, still a boy, in his kimono yukata and slippers, his\
  \ arms tucked into his sleeves against the breeze. He walked meditatively, in a\
  \ slow straight line, and I watched him idle along the edge of the rushing stream\
  \ that followed the lines of the hotel and the onsen in between."
