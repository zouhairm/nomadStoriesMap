Text: "There is no better way to discover countries than doing it the same way local\
  \ people do. Traveling by car I thought would give me the best opportunities to\
  \ explore and come the closest to authentic life. \nRaised by a father who loves\
  \ 4WD's, the moment my eye fell onto this red old Dodge Ram Charger across the road\
  \ from my hostel was love at first sight.\nNegotiating with the garage wasn't even\
  \ necessary. For as little as 900$ it would be mine. I was on top of the world.\
  \ It was the first car I ever bought and for it to be this spectacular I was excited\
  \ the least said!\n\nBut problems arose as soon as I hit the first border with Guatemala.\
  \ The car's paperwork  didn't match its license plates and customs wouldn't let\
  \ me pass. As a foreigner it soon turned out to be impossible to get new plates.\
  \ But to every problem there's a solution my positive brain said! I took the plates\
  \ off and reported them stolen at the local police station. 4 days later and with\
  \ 8 stamps more in my passport I finally crossed into Guatemala without license\
  \ plates.\n\nCharger took me to amazing hidden places and made me meet the kindest\
  \ local people who were very curious about this white girl driving a bad ass car\
  \ without plates. But it wasn't all sunshine and fun. The roads in Central America\
  \ are terrible as their governments don't care enough about them or the tourism\
  \ that drives along them, bringing a lot of work and money to their countries. \n\
  Potholes everywhere made the first burst inevitable. Luckily I had a spare with\
  \ me which solved the problem pretty easily, although it took me 5 minutes to realise\
  \ what just happened. The next 2 followed shortly after that while I was in the\
  \ middle of nowhere. After waiting in the hot afternoon sun a local took me to the\
  \ next garage to pick up some new tires. And drove me back to help me mount them.\
  \ The man was so lovely to offer me a place to sleep as the night was falling. I\
  \ ended up at his tiny house in La Ceiba. He had a wife and 4 kids and as a fisherman\
  \ obviously didn't have too much to spend. Still they shared every part of their\
  \ meal, house and life for that night with me. I was happy to be able to speak some\
  \ Spanish to even moreso bond with them. The little girl cried the next day when\
  \ I left. \n\nSpeaking Spanish helped me in many ways along my travels in these\
  \ beautiful countries. The most important to be able to connect with local people.\
  \ But it came also very useful as driving without plates not only called the attention\
  \ of local residents but apparently also of all police and armee that are everywhere\
  \ in this area. They tried to rip me off, saying I had to pay to drive without plates.\
  \ I knew I was okay with the police report from Mexico. Once I overheard a cop pretending\
  \ to have a conversation with his boss on the phone. He threatened he was going\
  \ to confiscate my car. I would always start of pretending not to understand Spanish\
  \ and this way 7 out of 10 times they would let me go because they got bored quickly\
  \ trying to explain themselves. I guess this guy in particular liked my car as he\
  \ was persistent to take it from me. As soon as I realized it was a fake conversation\
  \ I made clear to him in by then almost fluent Spanish I fully understood what he\
  \ was trying to do and that I would go to my embassy to report him if he wouldn't\
  \ let me and my ride go. Story done. 'Buen viaje hermana.' Gracias amigo! \n\nIn\
  \ Nicaragua I put on 2 tractor wheels as I was tired of changing tires all the time.\
  \ This hilarious sight brought me more friendships and took me further into the\
  \ continents' beautiful untouched countryside. \nBesides all trouble, Charger took\
  \ me inside local life. Life I will never forgot to have seen."
