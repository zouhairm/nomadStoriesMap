Text: "I didn\u2019t travelled much in my childhood, my single mother never had enough\
  \ money to see the world, but I remember really well my first time out of my birth\
  \ country, it was to go see my mum\u2019s family side in Serbia. We went by car,\
  \ that\u2019s a family tradition, my grandma on the wheel her dog beside her and\
  \ the rest try to survive in the back, I think it took us 3 days, 3 full days of\
  \ traditional Yugoslav music blasting through the old speakers of a 11 year old\
  \ Ford Car, it was long but not so painful when you see Europe flash before your\
  \ eyes, we arrived and let me tell you, I fell in love with the mountains of Novi\
  \ Pazar, driving through the hills, seeing goats at every turn, I did not care if\
  \ we were 100 of meters up, the only thing I could see was the nature and the bluest\
  \ of skies , as if I could touch the sky if we went higher, I had my fair share\
  \ of opportunities to go to the mountains because we always traveled to different\
  \ cities to go see some far away family members who didn\u2019t even know me, for\
  \ some reason we often drove in daylight when the weather was so hot the Sahara\
  \ would be jealous and something I didn\u2019t except was to see my beloved mountains\
  \ all around me, on fire... yes they were beautifully dressed in red and yellow\
  \ flames, burned with help of the deadly sun, it was crazy but oh so magnificent,\
  \ and it wasn\u2019t my last time seeing them on fire but a day remember clearly\
  \ was when my grandma and mum decided to go on one of those mountains that stopped\
  \ burning, the ones covered of the ashes of dead trees and bones of the wild life\
  \ as  a witness of the massacre, it was my call back to reality and frankly I still\
  \ cannot hate burning mountains, it was an image ingrained in my heart that I couldn\u2019\
  t hate even if I tried but it made me love even more the lively and green mountains,\
  \ the one where life is a seigneur, where trees reigns and wild forest are even\
  \ more beautiful than a dead fire.\nSerbia is full of flaws but it\u2019s nature\
  \ is breathtaking and so full of life that I would always recommend anyone to go\
  \ see Serbia\u2019s countryside."
