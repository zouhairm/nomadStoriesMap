  \ cliffs above. The place can get crowded though during weekends so to avoid them,\
  \ plan your trips on weekdays.\nOnce I arrived here and I can say that this place\

  I am from donsol sorsogon, and I'm proud of this place in the beautiful and natural\
  \ addictive beaches we have here, and the most exciting here is the manure with\
  \ the big butanding or known in the whaleshark, my dad is one of the tourguides\
  \ who accompany the guests swimming and explains the do and dont's for safety and\
  \ fun interaction with large ocean creatures.\nIt is perfect in the summer season\

  \ are coming out. Swim with the butanding is one of the fun and unforgettable moments\
  \ of my life.\n5. Subic beach matnog, still in Sorgoson Subic Beach is terrific.\
  \ A one kilometer long cove, the white sand has a very slight pinkish. This beach\
  \ has a pink sand, yes a PINK sand! What I liked the most about this place was,\
  \ not only that it has a majestic view, but people here were also very nice and\
  \ welcoming. We initially planned to stay and watch the beach under the trees but\
  \ they let us stay in one of the cottages for free.\n\nI still have so much to tell\
  \ you about the beautiful and mysterious beaches that have the country of the Philippines,\
  \ the places where you can find and experience it.\nbut the most important thing\
