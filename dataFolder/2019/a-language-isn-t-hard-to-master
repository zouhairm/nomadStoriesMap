Text: "Whenever I travel I find communicating the most important tool. Portugal used\
  \ to be our mother land so it is the same language and it isn\u2019t . Bus has a\
  \ different name so does the train whether you catch one or not it is a matter of\
  \ speaking with the right accent . What\u2019s the right one ? You only find that\
  \ out through the inumerous \u201Cmistakes\u201D and mispronounced words along the\
  \ way . \nThe place where eating a \u201C pastel de Belem \u201C is a trip itself\
  \ . Though the word pastel means something entirely different in Brazil. My mobile\
  \ insists it is Brasil with as \u201Cs\u201D. I keep correcting it . Which reminds\
  \ me mobile is celular over here and telem\xF3vel over there . The taste of different\
  \ sounds , the Portuguese with sugar ( as they say in Portugal ) we speak is as\
  \ different as the taste of octopuses that melt in your mouth over there . Ah the\
  \ food . Portuguese food will make you fat but very happy indeed . Every bite is\
  \ a remarkable experience , every step in the Streets of Porto puts you in the right\
  \ direction and the perfect mood . The city smells like the wine . Strong and sweet\
  \ . Harsh too sometimes. Through the Douro river you think you can fly. Wine tasting,\
  \ strolling around with nobody but yourself , wandering the place just for a moment\
  \ and you definitely get lost , if not in translation in sweet thoughts . Portugal\
  \ is a country with another language though it is the same in so many respects .\
  \ I didn\u2019t expect to find so many idioms and new words that somehow sound very\
  \ \u201C old\u201D for us . In this antique mood I fell in love . Coming from the\
  \ \u201C colony\u201D which once was , I found myself overwhelmed with the smell\
  \ and the people : a must go . A destination not to miss . A country not to dismiss\
  \ . Happy travels ."
