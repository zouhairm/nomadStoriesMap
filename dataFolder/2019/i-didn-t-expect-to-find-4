Text: "Once I loved a man so much that I decided to leave my spot in Paradise - the\
  \ sun, the sea - to pursue the dream. Travelling miles and miles away from where\
  \ I was born. Gone from all that I knew, from the warm embraces, from the soft and\
  \ supporting comfort that only good friends can give to you. I took a plane and\
  \ ended up, literally, on the other side of the world.  \nI arrived at night, after\
  \ what seemed an eternity, but in reality were two days and four different airports.\
  \ I had to wait a few hours to step into my new city, Melbourne, and my brand-new\
  \ life. \n\nNext morning, I caught the tram to the city centre where I had to pull\
  \ a cord to give notice that the next stop was mine: to pull a cord, literally,\
  \ or to get rid of my umbilical cord once and for all, figuratively? The doors opened,\
  \ and I stepped into the asphalt and glanced up. The sky was a magnificent blue.\
  \ The sidewalk, full of the tallest skyscrapers I had ever seen. My eyes opened\
  \ fully, and my mouth wide. \u201CThis is your home now; do not look like a tourist,\u201D\
  \ \u2013he said. He was right, and I started walking  those streets with all the\
  \ certitude I could bare in my feet.\n\nWhen you travel, when you\u2019re out of\
  \ your comfort zone, out of all you once knew, you\u2019re more alive than ever,\
  \ you\u2019re vigilant. Socket holes are different, house configurations are different,\
  \ smells and lights are different. The lifestyle is different. I got used to stumbling\
  \ into spiderwebs. I started eating porridge and being thankful for parties that\
  \ finished at 2am. I built from scratch a whole family with complete strangers,\
  \ a family who I went on to celebrate not only two Christmases with but also our\
  \ successes and our failures. \n\nMonths passed: a road-trip by the East coast,\
  \ a visit to the biggest sand island of the world, and a koala hug later, we had\
  \ to come back. To start over. Again. We returned to the place that was our home\
  \ before\u2026where everything was still in the same spot but us, but me. My spirit\
  \ had grown bigger: could it be contained in this space again? \n\nThey say once\
  \ you read a book and open a new aspect in your mind, you cannot go backwards. I\
  \ reckon that was exactly what happened. \n\nI found a job and tried to have a routine.\
  \ However, I kept looking for a better position, trying to find myself once more.\
  \ My prayers seemed to be answered. I lived the second winter of that year in \xC9\
  ire, where the green felt new, more vibrant than any other shade of green. Yet I\
  \ had the greyist winter of all. \n\nThis time it was just me for the adventure.\
  \ My tears, my broken heart and myself. Trust me, two winters in a row instil a\
  \ coldness within your bones\u2026 \nYet, I turned back to Paradise and expected\
  \ to fill my lungs with the old, good, fresh air, even for a while. But it was not\
  \ enough. Of course not. Curiously, being surrounded by my own language at any time,\
  \ made me freak out. The place I had called home for so long didn\u2019t seem to\
  \ be any more. \n\nMaybe that was the problem. I was, obviously. What to expect\
  \ then? I needed a real solo adventure, new experiences, to push my common limits\
  \ to truly believe in my capacities and myself. \n\nI landed in Rome in the next,\
  \ early autumn. The Coliseum took my breath away and finally, after what seemed\
  \ so long, there was warmth within my veins and my heart started beating again.\
  \ I started learning Italian from scratch. I created my third, fourth or fifth family.\
  \ I felt at home: finally, I felt like I was standing on my two feet again.\n\n\
  And it all started with my one-way trip. My story is like many others, I fell in\
  \ love and felt love profoundly. What I didn\u2019t expect to find was a bigger\
  \ love, a bigger connection. \n\nHe loved me, he dumped me, and I, I found myself."
