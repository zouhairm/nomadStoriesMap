Text: "A strange shiver ran down my body as I entered Philippi Township, \u2018Crime\
  \ Capital\u2019 of Cape Town city. The tourists usually avoid this unexplored area\
  \ due to high crime rates. \n\nI walked to the food truck run by the community to\
  \ have an early lunch \u2013 vetkoek and rice. And that\u2019s when I met Anathi,\
  \ a local entrepreneur. \u201CWe want the best lives for the kids of our community\u201D\
  , he said, as we watched the kids play and dance near the colorful refurbished containers\
  \ that the local entrepreneurs use as shops or office. I followed Anathi as he sat\
  \ down on the stairs. He continued, \u201CAnd that is why I started my IT business.\
  \ I have a computer that kids can use to access internet. You know the internet\
  \ is expensive here and I want to make it accessible to my community.\u201D I think,\
  \ \u201Cexpensive\u201D is an understatement for $140 a month for unlimited internet\
  \ vs. $2 in India. I would have rather used \u201Ccrazy expensive\u201D. \n\n\u201C\
  Go ahead. Have your lunch.\u201D Anathi nudged me back into the real world without\
  \ completing his story. \u201CSo, what are your plans about your business?\u201D\
  \ I had to ask. Being a management grad, I thought I could help. Anathi continued\
  \ from where he had left. \u201COh, I want to open a food joint with paid Wi-Fi\
  \ access. People already come to me to help them with paying the bills and assisting\
  \ their kids for their school work. But, internet can inspire them, you know. Help\
  \ our community grow, learn and be in touch with the rest of the world.\u201D \n\
  \nI thought he needed funding and that\u2019s where he was stuck. But, no, there\
  \ was so much more to the story than I had imagined. \n\n\u201CNO. I do not need\
  \ funding.\u201D It was as if I had just hurt his ego. \u201CI just do not know\
  \ how to do it. I know the final state, BUT NOT THE STEPS! I am not so great with\
  \ financials and planning the business. I am not sure if I can do it. But, it is\
  \ also not fair to wait for someone else to do it, when I am the only IT expert\
  \ around here, right?\u201D\n\nThere was a long pause. I was trying to think how\
  \ to answer that. \n\nI took out a notepad from my bag and started jotting down\
  \ few business details like revenue drivers, expense heads, projections, etc. As\
  \ I started, Anathi took the notebook from my hand and started writing everything\
  \ in further details. He put numbers across heads and ways to grow the business.\
  \ He even mentioned a friend we can partner with to help with food items. I was\
  \ just this happy kid who did nothing but did everything at the same time. \n\n\u201C\
  Ummm\u2026.. Well, doesn\u2019t really seem like you needed help to plan the business,\
  \ eh?\u201D \n\u201CI think I just needed some validation and a small push, I guess.\u201D\
  \n\nWe just smiled sitting there, again forgetting about the vetkoek waiting to\
  \ be had. \n\n\u201CSo, the next step would be capital investment and you will be\
  \ one step closer to your dream!\u201D, I asked just to close out the discussion.\
  \ Suddenly, Anathi\u2019s face turned red and sad. I had NO IDEA what had just gone\
  \ wrong in a matter of seconds. \u201CBut, if I invest in capital and buy more IT\
  \ equipment and furniture, they will think I am rich and \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\
  .\u201D, he stuttered. \n\nImagine a door in front of you with your dream world\
  \ on the other side. But, then it has your biggest fear waiting for you right behind\
  \ that door. Opening the door is not going to be easy. Some brave souls let go of\
  \ their fears to see their dreams for the society come true. I had seen the hope\
  \ in the gleaming eyes of Anathi."
