Text: "\u201CWhen in Spain\u2026\u201D\n\nIt would be impossible to describe one year\
  \ in Spain with just a phrase, but this one would be perfect. \n\nI started my one-year\
  \ Erasmus without even speaking Spanish and wondering what I was doing in Spain.\
  \ Was it for its history? The language? It must have been the second one, giving\
  \ my passion for foreign languages. Still, I was confused, excited, frightened,\
  \ happy. Yes, all at once. \n\nThat lasted for about one week, and then it came\
  \ the time in which I started getting late to classes, kissing people on the cheek\
  \ starting from the wrong side, taking long siestas, eating (maybe too much) tapas,\
  \ and shouting wrong phrases to my friends which sounded completely fine in Italian\
  \ but not in Spanish (that earned some weird glances, thinking that maybe I could\
  \ be pregnant when I just wanted to tell them that I was embarrassed). \n\nClich\xE9\
  s? I don\u2019t think so! Find out that maybe my guide animal is a sloth. A Spanish\
  \ one. I don\u2019t know if this can be described as finding myself, though. \n\n\
  The best part of all the year have been the trips around Spain, especially the Nochevieja\
  \ (New Years\u2019 Eve) in Salamanca, which is now celebrated before Christmas by\
  \ students. The tradition is to eat one grape for each chime of the bell at midnight.\
  \ Needless to say, I broke tradition since I just ate 4. In my defence, I will say\
  \ that it is quite an impossible feat to achieve. \n\nAnd thus the story ends, but\
  \ I can say that I came back knowing that I could not be the same person as before,\
  \ for many reasons: I grew up, overcame my insecurity, l lived alone without burning\
  \ down my house, met people from all over the world that I will never forget and\
  \ met two of the best friends I could ever dream of. And of course, now I speak\
  \ Spanish. That was the journey of my life, not just a year abroad. \n\nBy the way,\
  \ I passed all my exams."
