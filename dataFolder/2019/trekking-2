Text: "Pangarchulla Peak Trek\n\n\n\nTrekking is my first love. I have done few treks\
  \ previously but I didn't share my story because I love to keep my stories to myself\
  \ or share with my close ones. This is the first time I am writing my experience\
  \ on the       blog.                                                           \
  \                               \n\n\n                                         \
  \                                         I love trekking and there is no particular\
  \ reason for that, I just love it. There is something about mountains and i can\
  \ not explain that in words. It's just MAGICAL!!  We hear the stories about mountains\
  \ and while climbing them we make our own. Being on a mountain makes someone energetic\
  \ and positive and full of gratitude. In one moment you are not speaking anything,\
  \ just sitting and enjoying  the view. And in another moment you are talking; Talking\
  \ to the wind, the sound of water and what not, you are talking to the mountains.\
  \ People often asks Why Trekking?? \nAnd I  say If you never go, you will never\
  \ know.\U0001F60A                                                              \
  \                                                                              \
  \                     \n\n\n\n\n\nSo it was my fifth trek,  The Pangarchulla Peak.\
  \ It was a 5 day trek and I did this with TTH Team. Each day was amazing and I had\
  \ lot of experiences. But in this blog I will be sharing my Day 4th experience where\
  \ I climbed the summit. So here you go.....\n\n\nDay 4 - Pangarchulla Peak\n\n\n\
  \                          \nIt was 4th day of the trek and we ( the whole group)\
  \ had to climb the summit. We left the campsite at 4 am and it's gonna be a difficult\
  \ day because of the altitude. I woke up around 2 am and was bit nervous because\
  \ of the previous day weather condition. When we started the trek the weather was\
  \ calm and the sun was shining brightly. We did face some breathing problems because\
  \ of the altitude and till the basecamp  it was a smooth trail. But in mountains\
  \ the weather changes so drastically and after sometime we were struck by the storm\
  \ and  were at the altitude of around 14,500 ft. The last patch was definitely very\
  \ difficult and the snowfall and storm made it even more difficult. We did climb\
  \ the peak and would have spent 5 minutes on the peak.Those 5 minutes were amazing;\
  \ the feeling you are on the top of the mountain is a bliss. \n\n\n\nAt the time\
  \ of descend it turned out to be a life threatening experience. I was scared and\
  \ inside just hoping that the sun shines again and we should reach our camp safely...\
  \ \n\n\n                    \n\n\nAfter some time the sun was shining again and\
  \ we all were safe. And now there is one more experience added to my experiences\
  \ and i ll remember this forever. No matter what the peak was worth climbing and\
  \ that feeling when you capture the peak is amazing\U0001F495"
