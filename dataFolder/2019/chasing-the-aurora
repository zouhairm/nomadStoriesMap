Text: "Another wet sock, another change of clothes. This was getting ridiculous. From\
  \ the outside it probably looked like we were in that part of the horror movie with\
  \ everybody screaming \"DON'T GO IN\" or  \"STOP WALKING\". Regardless we walked,\
  \ no light, no guide, no map but we followed our innate desires thinking they would\
  \ lead us to our destination. That night we were Pocahontas. We heard waves but\
  \ saw no beach, this was getting weird. The only lights we could see were the ones\
  \ from the graveyard we had just parked beside. (In Iceland, they have a tradition\
  \ of using light up crosses on grave stones, the horror movie develops!). Right\
  \ now it was surely the land of ice more so than fire. We were wet, beyond freezing\
  \ and miserable but driven by our mission to do what we came all this way to do.\
  \ We looked, we stayed and we almost chanced pneumonia by lying down on the wet\
  \ straw. \n\n\"Hey!\", well to say I got the fright of my life would be an understatement.\
  \ Turns out it was the friendly guide from a tourist bus telling us we just missed\
  \ out but if we came back in two hours they might be there. As a group of five it\
  \ was a difficult decision to make on a 'might' , reluctantly we traveled back to\
  \ a petrol station. Pulling off our drenched clothes, was it worth it? Should we\
  \ just go back and go to bed? The tension could be cut with a knife but the decision\
  \ was final.\n\n \"Hey!\", ok this time it had to be a murderer. Thankfully it was\
  \ Henk, the wonderful tour guide we had come across on our earlier expedition. He\
  \ had returned on his own to take some shots. We joined him on the derelict walk.\
  \ A native Icelandic man, I was stunned by his standard of English, of course I\
  \ began asking questions. Henk set up his tripod and camera and we all waited. However,\
  \ the waiting didn't seem so long when three Irish girls and an Icelandic man spoke\
  \ about lives and worlds that were so different, yet so alike at the same time.\
  \ We ended up lying chest first on the ground as a shield from the horrendous winds\
  \ and bitter cold, that would freeze any part of you that was exposed in ten seconds.\
  \ (I wish I was exaggerating). That is one thing I will never forget about that\
  \ night, the possible onset of both hypothermia and frostbite at any moment. Minutes\
  \ pass. Suddenly, a scream. \n\nJust as we were about to throw in the towel, our\
  \ wildest dreams came true. Our reactions were not what I had envisioned, I have\
  \ to admit. Jumping, screaming and hugging like lunatics. We didn't see the greens\
  \ and purples from the images seen on Instagram, however, what we witnessed was\
  \ so much better. The most astounding white lights danced above us in the black\
  \ sky, teasing us, dipping in and out of our vision and it was real, forever ingrained\
  \ in my memory. It was a light show, our own private light show we had paid to see,\
  \ it was magical. The atmosphere was truly electric. Henk took kindly took professional\
  \ pictures of us. Then, all fell silent, in a flash it was gone. What seemed like\
  \ a stoppage in time for us was no more than a five minute miracle.\n\nI could feel\
  \ my heart and head explode with love and joy. Yes what we had just witnessed was\
  \ atonishing, but what I will remember is the waiting, the 'not so fun part'. The\
  \ laughter, shaking with the cold and the conversations. Henk kindly sent us on\
  \ our pictures free of charge the next day, souvenirs of the painful but incredible\
  \ night. It puzzled me though, how do people not search for these moments and travel,\
  \ all their lives?\n\nAfter reflection, I realized that sometimes travel is suffering\
  \ (in this case through horrendous weather and possible death) to get to that one\
  \ moment, that one view, or that one stranger never to meet again that you will\
  \ remember for the rest of your life."
