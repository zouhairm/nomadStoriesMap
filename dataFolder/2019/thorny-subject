Text: "I expect Big Bend to be beautifully desolate. Driving south, gray blue hills\
  \ hazy in the distance, a sea of yellow prairie grass sways below an enormous sky.\
  \ In the clouds I see sharp-beaked eagles with wispy wings as the parched landscape\
  \ gradually empties of all but Mesquite trees, stubborn cactus and glimpses of roadrunners.\
  \ Sixteenth-century Spanish explorers called this place el despoblado, \u201Cthe\
  \ uninhabited.\u201D We enter the park at Persimmon Gap. \u201CIt takes a special\
  \ kind of person to love the land out here,\u201D says our guide. \n\nBound for\
  \ the river carving the divide between Texas and Mexico, I am a budding writer on\
  \ an adventure. I am Huck Finn heading down my Mississippi. A spring break trip\
  \ organized by the University of Texas\u2019 Rec Sports, a dozen of us will paddle\
  \ 90 miles down the Rio Grande. In six canoes, we\u2019ll camp along the water\u2019\
  s edge as stars shoot across the night sky, brilliant as the city lights of Austin.\
  \ \n\nAt last, it\u2019s time to get in the water. My partner and I are sweeper,\
  \ the last boat in the line. I crouch in the bow through the rapids, balancing on\
  \ my knees, trying to avoid a cane ride through the narrow spots. Cows meander along\
  \ the banks of the river, barely giving us a passing glance. But the first day on\
  \ the big river takes an unexpected turn when helicopters buzz overhead, upsetting\
  \ our quiet glide. \n\nWhen a hovercraft whirs past I feel more like a bewildered\
  \ Alice than an intrepid Huck Finn. There\u2019s a body in the river, we\u2019re\
  \ told. \u201CIt\u2019s probably just a Mexican national,\u201D the border patrol\
  \ agent says. \u201CKeep an eye out?\u201D He zips downriver, leaving us blinking.\
  \ There\u2019s no way back. The current presses on, relentless as dread. \n\nIn\
  \ this remote expanse, the river is the lifeblood, washing the banks of all it touches\
  \ with welcome green. The river delivers us to him. It is not our eyes but noses\
  \ that alert us. Later, I learn the rancher died February 11. They say he told the\
  \ cartel to stop smuggling across his property, so they shot him and threw him in\
  \ the river. He drifted there for weeks before we helped pull him out. \n\nUnder\
  \ a black velvet sky gleaming with silent stars, when I finally fall asleep that\
  \ first night I dream of helicopters divebombing our campsite. \n\nOn the morning\
  \ of day four, I stumble across something else I didn\u2019t expect to find while\
  \ hiking Santa Elena Canyon. Rising up majestically on either side of river, ancient\
  \ limestone ridges tower as high as 1,500 feet. And there it was. A lone size nine\
  \ women\u2019s high heel shoe.\n\nRed as a prickly pear flower, jarring as a cactus\
  \ spire, it lodged like a splinter under my skin. Who would wear those to hike a\
  \ desert? And, looking down at my boots, who could keep going with just one shoe?\
  \ Did I stumble onto the footsteps of a human trafficking chain? Should I be looking\
  \ for another body? I scan the horizon but there\u2019s only the sun rising. \n\n\
  I never discovered the rancher\u2019s name. No mention was made of it that I could\
  \ find in the papers. A writer for the student newspaper, The Daily Texan, when\
  \ I wrote about my Big Bend trip, I left that part out. At the time, I thought nothing\
  \ I could write might make sense of it. A decade later, I am compelled to try. \n\
  \nBig Bend\u2019s beauty lies in its stark, elemental openness, sweeping mesas and\
  \ limitless sky. Nothing could ruin it faster than walling it up. I\u2019ve slept\
  \ on the opposite side of the river. The water carried me back and forward on my\
  \ journey. A wall only leads to an end."
