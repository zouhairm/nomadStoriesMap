Text: "Israel: a country that sits on the axis between the three major world religions,\
  \ a complex geopolitical struggle, and two major cultural influences, both Jewish\
  \ and Palestinian. As such, Israel is unique in the ways in which it blends the\
  \ Middle East with the Western world, both modern and timeless. I had the opportunity\
  \ to visit Israel in December 2018 with a diplomatic mission, and while I spent\
  \ my days musing over the implications of conflict, I couldn\u2019t help but find\
  \ myself day dreaming about the contrast between the country\u2019s rolling green\
  \ hills to the North along the Sea of Gallilee, desert crevices to the South along\
  \ the Dead Sea, and bustling night life in both Tel Aviv, a tech hub, and Jerusalem,\
  \ a cradle of civilization. \nThe food? Unparalleled. Waking up to an Israeli breakfast\
  \ every morning with fresh tahini, tomato and mozzarella salad, shakshouka, and\
  \ hummus galore was a mediterranean foodie\u2019s dream. As for sightseeing, there\
  \ really was something for everyone. Part of me wanted to curl up on the sands along\
  \ the Dead Sea for a full week, soaking in its world-renowned minerals that are\
  \ hailed for their rejuvenating effects. Another part of me could have spent my\
  \ entire time dashing between open-air markets, bartering using sheckles to try\
  \ and find the perfect little treasure\u2014like a woven rug, local spices, or maybe\
  \ just some fresh pomegranate juice. \nWhat really caught my attention while in\
  \ Israel was the fact that no matter where you were in the nation, you are playing\
  \ witness to a story much larger than yourself\u2014stories that people have dedicated\
  \ their lives to and that wars have been fought over. The power of religion, faith,\
  \ and belief is hard to deny when you walk the streets between the four quarters\
  \ of Jerusalem, observing the dedication of pilgrims and locals alike as they trek\
  \ to some of the holiest sights in the world. \nThe Dome of the Rock, one of the\
  \ holiest sites in Islam, really is something to behold. Capped with a massive gold\
  \ dome and adorned with intricate blue mosaic tiles, devout observers poured in\
  \ and out of its walls. The Western Wall was another intense experience. As I approached\
  \ the Wall, the holiest site in the Jewish faith, I saw women and their children\
  \ gathered around, some with their faces pressed against the wall, others their\
  \ hands, all praying feverishing with some to the point of crying. When I visited,\
  \ Shabbat was to be called in 15 minutes\u2014and when it was, a loud bell tolled\
  \ across the city, while thousands of people flooded to the Wall to pray. This mass\
  \ demonstration was a beautiful site to witness.\nThe Church of the Holy Sepulchre\
  \ was my last stop on the religious portion of my tour. As someone who had been\
  \ raised in the faith but considered myself agnostic, even I felt the hairs on my\
  \ arms raise. Here was the place that people believe Christ was crucified, died,\
  \ and was buried. These events have forever shaped the course of human history,\
  \ and religious belief aside, is . A little overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of\
  \ what this site meant, I meandered away from my group, walking through the nearby\
  \ market. I admittedly got a little lost, but when I looked up, I saw that I was\
  \ on St. Francis St.\u2014I myself being a graduate of St. Francis Xavier University,\
  \ where the practice is to take a picture with your class ring (the \u201CX Ring\u201D\
  ) while travelling to remind yourself of how far you\u2019ve come. I stopped, took\
  \ my snapshot, and immediately felt my experience come full circle.\nIsrael is a\
  \ country like no other. Billions of people feel a connection to a small plot of\
  \ land that at one point is only 15 kilometres wide. Yet those hills and those deserts\
  \ have played witness to some of the most important events of human history, as\
  \ well as a current conflict, and you can\u2019t help but feel a little lost (yet\
  \ maybe a little found) while paying homage to a tiny strip of land with a big role\
  \ to play."
