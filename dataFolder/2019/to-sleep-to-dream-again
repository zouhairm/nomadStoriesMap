Text: "I open my eyes from a dreamless sleep as the plane descends into Chennai, India.\
  \ After so many years, it still bugs me that, somehow, I just can't remember my\
  \ dreams. Maybe this is what city life does to you.\_\n\nI\u2019m on my way to spend\
  \ some time in Auroville, an experimental township known as the City of Dawn. It\
  \ was founded in 1968 by Mirra Alfassa (\"The Mother\") and designed by architect\
  \ Roger Anger. When the Mother founded Auroville, she was laying down a utopian\
  \ vision of new forms of individual and collective life.\n\nThe East Coast Road\
  \ takes me from Chennai to Auroville. Running for long stretches beside the Great\
  \ Salt Lake, my spirit begins to soar as I am serenaded by green India; verdant\
  \ groves of trees and the wide, open space of padi fields.\n\nWhat am I hoping to\
  \ find there? I\u2019m not sure. But I know I need a break from bustling Singapore.\
  \ The promise of a completely different way of life in Auroville is fascinating;\
  \ one that blends technology and spirituality, where people live closer to the land\
  \ and depend on seasons, not supermarkets.\_\n\nEventually, I turn into a side road\
  \ that grows narrower even as the trees grow denser. Communities with intriguing\
  \ names like \u2018Discipline\u2019, \u2018Aspiration\u2019 and \u2018Surrender\u2019\
  \ slide by. This is the Fertile Forest, the green belt of Auroville. It is all the\
  \ more spectacular because when the government first allotted the land to Auroville,\
  \ the place was barren, a literal wasteland.\n\nAnger's master plan was for Auroville\
  \ to be shaped like a galaxy. Several lines of force unwind from the centre: the\
  \ Matrimandir. Radiating beyond are four zones, each focusing on an important aspect\
  \ of the township\u2019s life. There\u2019s a cosmic otherworldliness here, and\
  \ most of it centres around the Matrimandir, the physical and spiritual heart of\
  \ Auroville.\_\n\nIt could be called a temple, but that\u2019s probably far too\
  \ simplistic. 37 years in the making, my first glimpse of it leaves me awestruck.\
  \ \_It seems alive, radiating with energy that pulses off the golden discs that\
  \ cover its surface. The Matrimandir is not a tourist experience. There is no entrance\
  \ fee. Entry is by appointment and only 76 people are allowed in at a time. People\
  \ visit to spend time meditating and connecting with an elemental self.\_\n\nWe\
  \ are bussed to a different gate from the viewing point and are led to a small garden.\
  \ Up close, the Matrimandir is a golden alien orb, startling against the blue sky.\
  \ \u2018Please remain quiet\u2019 a sign remonstrates, but already there is a low\
  \ murmur of anticipation. One woman breaks the cell phone ban and snaps pictures.\n\
  \n\u201CAuroville is here to realise human unity,\u201D shares our guide. We sit\
  \ under a large tree facing the dome. He asks the group, \"What will you do to realise\
  \ human unity?\u201D Be kind, get organised, forget social status. One man shouts,\
  \ \u201CEat and share good food!\u201D That gets a laugh.\n\n\u201CIt\u2019s time,\u201D\
  \ our guide says. We walk down a ramp between red sandstone petals that double as\
  \ meditation rooms. The Matrimandir hangs above us, suspended like a roosting alien\
  \ ship. A soft bell chimes. It is our turn.\_\n\nIn an antechamber, we wear white\
  \ socks to protect the marble floor then walk up a ramp into the inner chamber.\
  \ The whole space resonates with light and is so surreal that it wouldn\u2019t be\
  \ out of place on the set of Blade Runner. In the centre, a large crystal hums with\
  \ tangible energy. A single beam of light, guided by a heliostat on the roof, shines\
  \ down. We are asked to concentrate on the crystal for fifteen minutes. No chanting\
  \ or movement is allowed.\_\n\nAfterwards, we walk by a giant banyan tree that is\
  \ the physical center of Auroville. It is a natural companion to the Matrimandir,\
  \ a leafy sage that watches benevolently as we file by.\_\n\nThe next morning, I\
  \ am stirred by an eager rooster from a vivid dream where I\u2019m walking on the\
  \ shore of the Coromandel coast. Here in Auroville the sun is beginning to warm\
  \ the day, along with the joy of realising that something has changed. I remember\
  \ my dreams again."
