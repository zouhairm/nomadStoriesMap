Text: "Halfway across the world, 4,000 miles from the refuge of home, I was lost.\
  \ Cell phones were still relatively rare at this time, and there was no map to consult,\
  \ no number to call, no purpose in hopping in a cab and praying someone spoke English\
  \ - I did not even know Dedushka Lev\u2019s address. Still, anxiety would only hinder\
  \ my effort to navigate my way back to my grandfather. It was time to dig into my\
  \ memories. \n        I remembered the Intercity Express bullet train between Munich\
  \ and Straubing blowing past miles of barren winter countryside. Factories pumped\
  \ mushrooms of steam into the air. The train pushed me closer to the small city\
  \ along the Danube. \n\tA cab pulled up to a 10-story brick apartment, a blocky\
  \ structure that stood out from the pastel houses of Bavaria. As my family and I\
  \ entered the apartment, I took in the sunlight burning through the lace curtains.\
  \ The sun illuminated a bookshelf full of china teacups and matryoshka dolls. Toward\
  \ the wall, a table presented dozens of cuts of salami and bread. It was tea time.\
  \ The old man, smiling as he sunk into the couch, had officially welcomed us to\
  \ his home.\n\tA white wreath of hair nested atop the man\u2019s wrinkled forehead.\
  \ He seemed to perpetually wear a dark sweater to keep warm against the drafts common\
  \ to south German winter. This was my first time seeing him in person - all else\
  \ was legend relayed by my parents. They told me he had built up his puppetry business\
  \ in Ukraine (the country where I was born) before settling in Straubing. \n\tA\
  \ chilly alpine wind brought me back to my present condition. Dead leaves somersaulted\
  \ around the cobblestone town square. I walked past the onion-dome church and looked\
  \ at the hills. Finally, a spark in my synapses. His apartment was up there, crowning\
  \ the winding roads. I wove through the buildings whose burnt sienna rooftops blocked\
  \ out the distant Alps, and when I finally arrived at the apartment door, I knew\
  \ by instinct that there was family inside.\n\n\tA decade after my family\u2019\
  s trip to Germany, my mother was returning to the former Soviet Union to support\
  \ her ailing mother, whom she had built a resentment towards. Babushka Larisa constantly\
  \ pleaded for money from her daughter, who had to remind her that the American government\
  \ didn\u2019t ship boxes of cash to our doorstep. There was not much for my mother\
  \ back home besides estranged family, unpleasant memories, and a brewing conflict\
  \ with Russia. But Larisa was, after all, her mother. So, despite the volatile politics\
  \ of Ukraine, my mother was returning. Fearing that she might not make it back home,\
  \ she revealed the family secret - Dedushka Lev was not my grandfather by blood.\
  \ \n       For a moment I felt disoriented, a sense of the same confusion and panic\
  \ that took hold when I was lost in the maze-like roads of Straubing. But as I thought\
  \ back to those December days, I remembered the anecdotes Lev told, the warmth with\
  \ which he had greeted us, the effort he had taken to make sure we were fed and\
  \ given plenty of Haribo gummies and Kinder chocolates for dessert. I recalled what\
  \ my parents told me about how his puppet studio funded my father\u2019s engineering\
  \ studies at the local polytechnic institute, which afforded us the skills to immigrate\
  \ to America and settle in Brooklyn. And as I reminisced on the brief moments we\
  \ had together, I felt a sense of warmth and even kinship with the man I called\
  \ Dedushka Lev. \n      He was, after all, my grandfather."
