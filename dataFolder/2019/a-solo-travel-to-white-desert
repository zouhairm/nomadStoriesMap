Text: "On a normal work day i call to my dad, start crying and started telling my\
  \ problems. Due to work pressure i went to seviour depression and started using\
  \ sedatives. After 1 hour he transfer some amount of money to my account and message\
  \ me \"Go & find what makes you happy!\"\nIn next minute i switchoff my mobile and\
  \ started my journey to Rann of Kutch (located near indo pak border), Gujrat in\
  \ India on 22nd nov 2018 from Hyderabad by train. I met lotsof people in that 32\
  \ hrs of journey! Listening to their stories & their pains i came to conclusion\
  \ my worries are too small!\n After 32 hours train journey i departure at Bhuj which\
  \ is little town in Gujrat and book a local tent camp in a small village near to\
  \ bhuj. I reach the camp (in desert) by 7.30 pm and took fresh bath after 34 hours\
  \ of hard journey. After a delicious dinner they give me a small open top tent so\
  \ i can experience night sky. I found aromatic candel in my bag and lighted that\
  \ in my tent. Feeling that sandalwood aroma, watching night sky and in my heart\
  \ thanked my social teacher who say me about this place when i was 11 yeara old!\
  \ That desert makes me feel better for sleep without taking any sedatives!\nNext\
  \ day i woke up by 3.30 am and rent a bike from camp organizer, started my journey\
  \ to White desert i.e, Rann of Kutch which is 100 kms away from our camp. I reach\
  \ Great rann by 6 am and to experience sun rise at crystal clear white desert. I\
  \ feel like that is the edge to earth and waiting for sun to raise from that edge.\
  \ After 10 mins golden rays fall on me and slowly sun rises from that edge. I sat\
  \ there in padmasan position (yoga) for an hour and forgot all my problems. By feeling\
  \ eternal happiness i started my journey to India bridge (first bridge in India)\
  \ through a road surrounded by desert via khavda!\nI reached India bridge by 10.30\
  \ am and met BSF soldiers (Border security force) and listen to many stories about\
  \ 1961 indo-pak war. From there i visited kalo dhungar (Black hills) highest point\
  \ at white desert (above 460 altitude from Rann) and watch overall view of white\
  \ desert!\nBy 5 pm i came back to Great Rann to experience sun set. Out of my syllabus\
  \ that day is super moon day. So i experienced half red coloured sun (sun set) in\
  \ west side edge and half gold coloured moon raising from east side edge (on full\
  \ moon day)\nMemorable experience! I rented a place to keep my bike there and by\
  \ 10.30 pm i started my journey to Dholavira 250 kms away from Great rann by bus.\
  \ I reached there by 5 am nxt day and visit little rann (other side of white desert)\
  \ and experience sun raise again. There i visit rann lake which is present in middle\
  \ of white desert \nand found some winter guests from Russia and Serbia i.e, flamingos.\
  \ Without any disturbance i sat peacefully there for 2 hrs and started printing\
  \ that scenery in my brain. A small mountain in middle of that lake at White desert,\
  \ flamingos and seagulls in that lake, that mountain covered wid greenery... That\
  \ memory still makes my soul happy! Later i visited ancient Harappan city nd experience\
  \ heritage there! By 1 pm i started my journey to mandvi by sharing taxi. We reach\
  \ mandvi beach by 5.30 pm to experience India's last sun set. From there i went\
  \ to Great rann to collect my bike and return that bike to organizer at 11.30 pm\
  \ nd started my journey to Ahmedabad to catch flight to Hyderabad!\nAfter coming\
  \ to home i receive a letter from my dad \" I may not be with you all time, but\
  \ i can give you freedom that every daughter expect from her father! \""
