Text: "\u201CThat\u2019s a BIG one right there,\u201D Franks voice booms out. \n\n\
  Eight of us are clustered on a weathered termite mound in the middle of the South\
  \ African Sabi Sands Game Reserve. Ages ago, termites had used their feces and plant\
  \ matter to construct, mouthful by tiny termite mouthful, this impossibly hard (now\
  \ abandoned) dwelling riddled with tunnels and at its core, a fungus farm basement.\
  \ Taller than any of us, it provides a superb line of sight to the herd of a dozen\
  \ elephants only a few jeep lengths ahead of us.  \n\nMinutes earlier, as he drove\
  \ us through the bush, our safari guide Owen was lecturing us in his burnished accent\
  \ on the merits of vegetarian versus carnivorous diets for weight loss. \u201CLook\
  \ at elephants. They eat plants all day and they\u2019re huge. Whereas lions\u2013\
  \u201D He interrupted himself to stop the jeep, pick up the radio, hold a brief\
  \ conversation in Afrikaans, then turn to look back at us. There was a herd of elephants\
  \ nearby, he said, and \u2013 while he didn\u2019t do this often \u2013 he was going\
  \ to take a risk and lead us on a bush walk to see them. \n\n\u201CGather round,\u201D\
  \ he said, as he loaded hollow point bullets into his rifle. We hopped out of the\
  \ jeep obediently. \u201CWhen you shoot an elephant, you shoot to kill - too risky\
  \ to try to disable the beast,\u201D he explained. \u201CTheir tough hides and thick\
  \ skulls leave me only the option to shoot it between the eyes. That\u2019s why\
  \ it\u2019s important that we\u2019re extremely quiet. Elephants have poor eyesight\
  \ but keen hearing. Any loud noises will put them on alert and then they may charge.\u201D\
  \n\nWe all nodded that we understood. Even Frank.\n\nTracking the elephants through\
  \ the bush was easy. In their lumbering wake they left thick underbrush steamroller\
  \ flat, interrupted only by denuded tree limbs. We walked silently along the elephant-made\
  \ boulevard for several minutes, avoiding heaps upon heaps of clumpy elephant dung,\
  \ then followed Owen up onto the termite mound.\n\nThere they were. The elephants\
  \ swung their pendulous trunks up and down up and down, the only sounds the crush\
  \ of plants beneath large feet and the whooshing crackle of supple trunks stripping\
  \ leaves from branches then depositing them into mouths in one motion. As we watched,\
  \ more members of the herd emerged shepherding two babies and working their way\
  \ towards us. Their ears flapped contentedly as they took down helpings of the hundreds\
  \ of pounds of greenery they munch each day. \n\nGradually, out of the trees authoritatively\
  \ sauntered a large female elephant, the herd\u2019s matriarch. \n\nWebs of communications\
  \ wend throughout the bush, guiding the behavior of its native residents, yet mostly\
  \ unobservable to us. Elephants send rumbling messages at frequencies too low for\
  \ our human ears to hear. Acacia trees release wind-blown pheromones to warn its\
  \ fellows that elephants are grazing and to therefore increase the unappetizing\
  \ tannin levels in their leaves. Elephants, in return, monitor wind directions and\
  \ graze against the wind. \n\nWhat is not common to the network of communication\
  \ that the residents of the bush regularly monitor, however, is the sound of Frank\
  \ exclaiming, \u201CThat\u2019s a BIG one right there!\u201D With that exclamation\
  \ he shoots a red flag up into the web of communication and disrupts the matriarch\u2019\
  s grazing. With two young vulnerable elephants in the pack, she is now on high alert.\
  \ \n\nShe freezes. We freeze.\n\nHer ears flare wide as she stares in our direction\
  \ and listens intently. Owen shoots a warning look at us as he quietly cocks his\
  \ rifle. \n\nFor a loopy few seconds we seesaw between \u2018will she, won\u2019\
  t she?\u2019 Are we silly humans about to be responsible for our deaths or the death\
  \ of this formidable matriarch? \n\nLater, after the matriarch elephant determines\
  \ we\u2019re no threat and resumes grazing... \n\nAfter Owen tensely escorts us\
  \ off the mound and back to our jeep... \n\nAfter a checked tablecloth is spread\
  \ over the jeep\u2019s hood and cocktails handed around....\n\nLater, we will ask\
  \ Owen to act out his spirit animal. And, as the sun coasts below the horizon, Owen\
  \ will charge at us, trumpeting loudly with his arms spread wide like two enormous\
  \ ears."
