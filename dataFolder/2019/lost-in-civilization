Text: "Turning around the corner, I had to admit to myself what I had already known\
  \ a few blogs earlier: I was lost. Carrying a heavy 80-liter backpack on my back\
  \ and another daypack at the front, I felt as if the huge, grey concrete buildings\
  \ where closing in on me. The rain came pouring down, the floor was covered by bubble\
  \ gum, pieces of paper and needles and there was an indefinable smell in the air.\
  \ Pulling my hood closer, I desperately tried to make a connection between the San\
  \ Francisco I was experiencing now and the one that I had been to just two years\
  \ ago and remembered as a beautiful, colorful and vibrant place full of kind and\
  \ cheerful people. \n\nThe only ones I came across now were homeless people eyeing\
  \ me with a mixture of curiosity and greed; old men showing their yellow teeth in\
  \ a suggestive smile, winking at me. Despite feeling sorry for them, I was scared\
  \ too, so I considered it best to simply walk on. Having been awake for 36 hours\
  \ now, I could not recall the directions to the hotel which I had memorized on the\
  \ plane. Unluckily, I could not count on my phone either which went dead some time\
  \ ago. At first, I did not consider this to be a problem since after all, I wasn\u2019\
  t in the middle of nowhere but in huge and vivid San Francisco. It seemed natural\
  \ to me that I would meet someone who could show me the way. However, I soon had\
  \ to realize that the area where the hotel was located (or at least where I thought\
  \ it would be since I had no idea where I was anymore) did not seem to be that frequented\
  \ but by all the homeless people now seeking shelter in entrances as the air cooled\
  \ down. Many of them were taking drugs, inserting long needles into their already\
  \ bruised arms. \t\t\t\t\t\t   \nDusk was about to fall; the rain became more and\
  \ more intense and fog came drifting up the streets from the water front. Not wanting\
  \ to be here in the dark, I walked on more quickly, heading for the next deserted\
  \ crossroad with its broken traffic lights dangling across. The rain became so heavy\
  \ I couldn\u2019t make out the street sign until I stood right below it. Again,\
  \ it read a name that I couldn\u2019t remember ever having come across when memorizing\
  \ the directions. Filled with despair, I almost cried out loud. How on earth was\
  \ it possible that I got that lost in a huge, civilized city?\n\nBlock after block,\
  \ I walked on, my feet starting to hurt, my shoulders having gone numb a while ago.\
  \ When I suddenly heard a car approaching me from behind, slowing down as it came\
  \ closer, I turned around horrified, adrenaline rushing through my veins. Due to\
  \ the fog, I could not make out the man stepping out of the passenger\u2019s door.\
  \ Almost inaudible through the rain, I heard him shout \u201Cwe are police. You\
  \ should not be here at night, come over and we will take you somewhere saver.\u201D\
  \ Carefully, I approached the car, preparing myself to run away any moment. I cannot\
  \ describe the feeling of relieve when I realized he was indeed wearing a uniform\
  \ and holding his badge out towards me.\n\nWhen the two incredibly kind police officers\
  \ dropped me off at my hotel half an hour later (which meant I had been more than\
  \ in the wrong area), I was still shaking, my mind racing around, trying to make\
  \ sense of what just happened and thinking about what could have happened if I had\
  \ not been picked up. The officers had told me some facts about the area I had been\
  \ in and, despite it being a horrifying experience to be completely lost, I started\
  \ to think about it in a different light too. In a straightforward and shocking\
  \ way, I had learned about San Francisco\u2019s divide, it\u2019s second face many\
  \ people don\u2019t know much about. After all, there is more to a city than its\
  \ main shopping street and that is something we should always keep in mind."
