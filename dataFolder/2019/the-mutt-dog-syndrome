Text: "I was at a supermarket in Lisbon with my big sister and we were taking up the\
  \ courage to buy wine. Age wasn't the problem, as we were old enough to do so and\
  \ had been for a while, but purchasing alcohol in a country that wasn't Brazil felt\
  \ weird. So, through the aisles of sardinha fish and olive oil at the supermarket,\
  \ I wondered. My everlasting 15-year-old appearance had nothing to do with it: looking\
  \ young never made me shy at home or in any other country I had bought drinks from.\
  \ Then, it hit me. The problem with me buying wine wasn't the wine itself, but where\
  \ I was buying it. \n\nAs a brazilian, being in Portugal was fun, exciting, inspiring\
  \ and always\u2026 slightly uncomfortable. There's something to be said about walking\
  \ down the beautiful streets of Chiado and casually bumping into a statue of some\
  \ king who colonized our country, changed our language, took away our gold and went\
  \ home okay. Trying to buy wine in portuguese lands gave me a problem of uncontrollable\
  \ low self-esteem. I felt like an intruder at country that had intruded mine.\n\n\
  In Brazil, we have a name for those inferior feelings towards our \"founders\":\
  \ mutt dog syndrome. We are bigger than they are. We have more people than they\
  \ could fit into the Iberian and I still felt like, somehow, I was bothering the\
  \ whole country trying to buy that wine for 70 cents. Like the lady working at the\
  \ market would make fun of my colonized accent when I told her obrigada or that,\
  \ perhaps, she would think all brazilians are like me,  tasteless with their beverage\
  \ and coward with their ways. There was nothing wrong with her; she was smiley and\
  \ told me to have a good night. Unfortunately, we don't choose how we feel, and,\
  \ at that moment, I felt second-class to everyone but my brazilian sister. No matter\
  \ how light you pack, heritage is something you can't leave out of your luggage.\
  \ \n\nMaybe brazilians like Lisbon so much because it's everything Rio de Janeiro\
  \ fails at: it's right next to the wealthy countries, it's safe and it even snows\
  \ sometimes, which is the fanciest thing a tropical weather can dream of. The feelings\
  \ of disdain towards ourselves make us smaller. By definition, Brazil is an emerging\
  \ country \u2014 emerging as an expectation that never rises up to its potential,\
  \ a mix of things trying to fit in with the popular guys who don't actually care\
  \ about them. We try so hard to copy the european ways we forget there's beauty\
  \ in our big, confused land. \n\nLater that day, two guys approached us at Mirante\
  \ do Adamastor, the observation deck we were in. I, filled with bravery after one\
  \ cheap wine too many, talked to them for about five minutes until I made a remark\
  \ about the island I was born in the south of Brazil. I was interrupted, as if I'd\
  \ said something so absurd it wasn't worth finishing: \"Oh, you guys are\u2026 brazilian?\"\
  , they stared at us, so surprised it surprised me. \"Us too!\".\n\nI was disappointed\
  \ we didn't unravel each other sooner. Maybe after all the years of pretending to\
  \ be Beagles and Golden Retrievers, the mutt dogs have lost their sniffing abilities."
