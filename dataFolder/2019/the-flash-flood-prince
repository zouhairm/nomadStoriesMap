Text: "The first storm of the year came at night, cracking the sky like a windshield.\
  \ There seemed to be invisible bombs falling on the city of Barranquilla, turning\
  \ into debris everything we\u2019d known\u2014the wobbling fruit carriages; the\
  \ color-splattered buses, aka saunas on wheels; and even La Troja, the high temple\
  \ of a Colombian party.\n\nAwakened, I joined my roommates in the living room of\
  \ our shared apartment. We gaped with a mix of fear and fascination at the violent\
  \ river forming in front of our house.\n\n\u201CIs this Doomsday?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \n\u201CNo, just the beginning of the rainy season,\u201D my roommate said. \u201C\
  And here\u2019s your long-awaited arroyo.\u201D\n\nI\u2019d heard legends about\
  \ arroyos, streams of water taking over the entire city. As Barranquilla didn\u2019\
  t have a sewage system, even small rain would change roads into fierce rivers. They\
  \ flew through the town, carrying trash, motorbikes, cars, and sometimes people\
  \ if they were careless enough to leave their homes. Arroyo was a local disaster\
  \ and life had to stop in the face of the wet death. There was no appointment, no\
  \ class, and no exam important enough to go out when it rained.\n\nQuickly enough,\
  \ I learned myself what it meant to be caught up in flood. I got stuck on a small\
  \ bus on the way to work. The mad current was pushing us down, but the driver knew\
  \ exactly how to park his vehicle so it didn\u2019t end up on the pile of cars we\
  \ could see from afar. The water level was rising with every minute. The ceiling\
  \ was leaking. A little girl sitting next to me cried. Strangely, I wasn\u2019t\
  \ scared. I was mesmerized.\n\nTwenty long minutes later, the bus was out of the\
  \ flash flood, unharmed. But the worst was still before me\u2014crossing the famous\
  \ arroyo of Carrera 44. On foot! \n\nObviously, it was a mission impossible. Even\
  \ if the current didn\u2019t pull me down, I would end up with a foot fungus at\
  \ best. So I stared helplessly at the other side of the street where the secretaries\
  \ and students cramped on the school\u2019s stairs. So close, yet so far. I couldn\u2019\
  t believe I was about to be late for work anyway. My boss would understand. In the\
  \ case of rain, both teachers and students were excused from their absences. But\
  \ for me, it was a matter of pride. I had to cross that street. But how?\n\nYou\
  \ know what they say\u2014when the damsel in distress is ready, the knight on a\
  \ white horse appears. Or something like that. So there he was, the man for the\
  \ job, my hero\u2014a mototaxi boy. I looked at him, he looked at me, and we both\
  \ knew what was going to happen. He pointed at the seat behind him, and I obediently\
  \ jumped on the back of his motorbike. Was I really ready to die in the depths of\
  \ dirty water and trash? Hell no! I loved Mother Earth, and She loved me back.\n\
  \nHalf of the school observed in shock as we pushed against the current, my feet\
  \ almost on the handlebars. My Prince Charming pressed the clutch and swiftly drove\
  \ onto a concrete block on the other side. We made it. I kissed his cheek and entered\
  \ the school, with a smirk of pride and madness. My reputation of la gringa loca\
  \ was proven once again. \n\nWould my mom approve of that reckless behavior? Probably\
  \ not, just as she wasn\u2019t happy about me moving to Colombia in the first place.\
  \ But I didn\u2019t care. I loved Barranquilla, with all its dangers and joys. Indeed,\
  \ it was easy to die in the city where mototaxi boys turned into daredevil captains\
  \ on the raging waters of flash floods. But it was even easier to feel alive."
