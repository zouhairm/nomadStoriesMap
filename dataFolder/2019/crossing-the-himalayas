Text: "The black, rusting carcass of another Jeep laid upside down over the edge of\
  \ the snowy cliff. Every corner we took we felt too close to crashing for comfort.\
  \ No traffic lights, no lines, no road rules, there was barely a road. We relied\
  \ on our Tibetan refugee driver Namgyal to maneuver us through the highest and most\
  \ dangerous roads in the world on our journey to Leh, India.\n\nI had never planned\
  \ on going to India so soon, let alone a disputed territory like Kashmir. I was\
  \ eighteen and it had only been a few days since I had left Canada on my own for\
  \ the first time to backpack through Southeast Asia. I had no idea what I was in\
  \ for when a group of five travellers asked me, \u201CDo you want to come with us\
  \ to India?\u201D We had met at a hostel in Pai only ten minutes before we were\
  \ buying plane tickets together.\n\t\n\tTwo days later I was boarding a plane from\
  \ Bangkok to New Delhi with five strangers, where we would begin our long and rough\
  \ journey north to the Himalayas. I had researched for months the destinations I\
  \ planned on visiting before I left for this trip, but India? I could not have been\
  \ more unprepared for what was to come.\n\n\tThe long, uncomfortable drive was something\
  \ I will never forget. The Jeep had no seatbelts which added some adrenaline to\
  \ the journey, but also unfortunately resulted in a smashed face and nosebleed at\
  \ one point. Not much you can do about yaks running in front of your vehicle. Once\
  \ we made it out of the most intense traffic jam of my life and achieved a higher\
  \ elevation, the Himalayas were breathtaking in every sense. \u201CI\u2019ll take\
  \ another altitude pill,  please.\u201D\n\n\tLeh was the destination, but the two\
  \ day journey was the real adventure. This was the experience I had been dreaming\
  \ of, but never expected it to come so soon. \n\nHalfway through the trip we stayed\
  \ the night in the small village of Keylong. As the only travellers in the only\
  \ guest house, we were treated like family. The mountain air was crisp and aromatic\
  \ with the scent of delicious butter chicken our host was cooking up. \n\n\tThe\
  \ next day began at sunrise to return to another lengthy drive. This early in the\
  \ morning the mountain peaks glowed an incredible pink and gold that kissed the\
  \ turquoise sky. A few more hours of driving and we stopped at a blue tarp tent\
  \ on the side of the road. There was a bitter chill in the thin air as we were greeted\
  \ by an enthusiastic smiling man in the tent. He fed us a fried egg and warm masala\
  \ chai, just what we needed. We chatted under the cold tarp with our new friend\
  \ for what seemed like ages. For such a low budget accomodation, it felt so comfortable\
  \ and blissful. That is hospitality I will always remember.\n\n\tAs we continued\
  \ on, we drove through some of the highest motorable passes in the world, over 17,500\
  \ feet. Snow-capped mountains always make me smile, but these ones a little more\
  \ due to the overjoyed Indian families in their 80s snowsuits attempting to make\
  \ snow angels in five centimeters of snow. \n\tThe signs marking the passes truly\
  \ embodied the experience. Taglang La, the second highest pass in the world, had\
  \ one that read, \u201CUNBELIEVABLE IS NOT IT?\u201D and I think everyone who passes\
  \ through will understand. Being up so high on those roads and looking out to see\
  \ only snowy peaks for miles made me feel like the world was ours. The landscape\
  \ had such a magnetic attraction to it, you could not keep your eyes off it. This\
  \ was the moment I felt the true sense of adventure. I had leapt into the unknown\
  \ and this was where it got me. Unbelievable, is not it?"
