Text: "Darwin, Northern Territory, Australia.\nIn this ending dry season, a bloody\
  \ hot day. I can see the stream of my own sweat surrounding me while I walk back\
  \ from the lagoon.\nAs soon as I will leave the dwelling, I will be back on the\
  \ road. Red, dusty, wallabie\u2019s carcass on both sides.\nWherever you are, the\
  \ air is heavy, smelling death. No wind. Not even a little breathe. And too many\
  \ flies to keep calm. Time goes slower up North but not for flies. They love it\
  \ here.\n\nSince I put a foot in this wild territory I feel the living essence of\
  \ every being multiplicated. The sound of the Galahs in the trees, the geckos screaming\
  \ always more than three times, the thunderstorms scratching the sky during the\
  \ wet season, as loud as if Zeus himself would have yelled to us. Everything is\
  \ more.\n\nA sense of danger specific to the North. Like living with Crocodile Dundee\
  \ back to his time. It\u2019s impossible to swim in the sea, full of saltwater crocodiles.\
  \ Impossible to go for a proper tramping due to a severe risk of dehydratation and\
  \ no mountains around anyway. Not even a peak.\nIt\u2019s different. Somehow delightful.\
  \ It seems that being alive has more importance there. That life has been taking\
  \ another dimension already. Another form of respect, deeper, more intense.\n\n\
  It\u2019s not about the buildings and all the concrete used to create this charming\
  \ city center with fountains and palm trees. This lagoon and its modern waterfront\
  \ with small cafes and trendy shops. It can be like that at this precise moment.\
  \ What is present here has no timing. It\u2019s the spirit of this place, of this\
  \ tremendous land where I can feel in the atmosphere a vibrating intensity.\nIt\u2019\
  s how the living has been settling over there, the desert at its right, the crocs\
  \ at its left, for so long\u2026\nThe magnificence of life and death all around.\
  \ The monism of our world perfectly represented between the toughness of the red\
  \ immensity surrounding the contagious knack of the dwellers.\n\nNavigating through\
  \ the desertic streets, looking at the common aboriginal faces lying under the shade\
  \ I think about the concept of life. How these aboriginal tribes endured so much\
  \ for so long with this undefectible pride, this honor and this love for their land\
  \ ? Meanwhile white people to whom I belong, had the time to destroy so much of\
  \ our world, desecrating the very meaning of life, entertaining ourselves instead\
  \ of learning and growing?\n\nNavigating through Darwin as I navigate in my mind\
  \ nebula, I feel blessed and a bit sad to leave the top end of my chapter in Australia.\n\
  I came across the emptiness of deserted immensities. Across loneliness and nothingness\
  \ of dark nights always full of stars.\nI came through swarming rainforest with\
  \ abounding wilderness hidden everywhere, to running streams of towering ferns.\n\
  It was like living a whole existence in a period of time divided by ten. And the\
  \ same wilderness came along my thoughts and feelings, teaching me how to apprehend\
  \ life and surrender myself to what can\u2019t be controlled.\n\nWaiting for this\
  \ cab coming in few minutes to drop me to the airport, browsing around a last time\
  \ I realize that Life has been taught to me in my Western World in a wrong way.\
  \ \nThere are so many perfections in life because there are so many perceptions.\n\
  By travelling I found the passion that would became my trade for a time. This allows\
  \ me to travel and work everywhere I wanted to go. Digging deeper as the kilometres\
  \ away were increasing. Ignorance is not bliss and I left home trying to find a\
  \ meaning to my life, a purpose. By just following the flow, like a lot of travellers.\
  \ Nothing really surprising so far!\nThe Australian top end was my unconscious north\
  \ star. Not knowing what I didn\u2019t know, by travelling I\u2019ve learn how to\
  \ live. And by learning how to live, I\u2019ve learned myself. I found out I was\
  \ a I. And I wasn\u2019t living. Only being.\nI left thinking to find What and How.\
  \ I found Who at first.\nDarwin, perfect catalyser of the human genesis."
