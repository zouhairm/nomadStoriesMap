Text: "I had the opportunity to get to know Dubai during my trip to live in Australia,\
  \ it was some days ago actually but I won't never forget it.\nI can assure you that\
  \ in my life I had never dreamed of seeing a beauty as exuberant as the ones I saw\
  \ in the streets of Dubai. The first sensation I had was to dive into a television\
  \ screen, I did not know if I could use a remote control and play video games with\
  \ all those incredible cars and unimaginable landscapes, or if I was just dazzling\
  \ buildings from a movie set futuristic. \nThe Burj Khalifa was undoubtedly what\
  \ struck me most with its fantastic architecture, the grandiose work and the beauty\
  \ of the estate that before I saw it I thought it did not exist. Also, I could hardly\
  \ believe when I was in front of the Burj Al Arab in the middle of the sea which\
  \ years ago it was just desert. \nI met people, I knew their stories, part of their\
  \ culture, I learned a lot about the local religion and included myself within this\
  \ reality. I observed every detail of that place, its riches, all gold and moral\
  \ and cultural values existing there.There was still time to do some shopping in\
  \ the Dubai mall, the largest shopping center in the world, located in the Burj\
  \ Khalifa complex.\nLastly, I can not miss out on this story the moment I find out\
  \ Dubai Marina located on the edge of the largest artificial marina in the world\
  \ that is among one of the best regions of Dubai to stay and also to walk. The Dubai\
  \ Marina has a calm climate, a beautiful promenade, is full of cafes and restaurants\
  \ and, from the break, it is very close to the sea, I must go back there to have\
  \ some coffee. Travelling to United Arab Emirates, It was my first international\
  \ trip and I do not know if that was the reason it became the most unforgettable\
  \ of them all.\nLights, architecture, culture, history, tourism and an incredible\
  \ scenery to enjoy. Dubai was not part of my plans, I have never imagined knowing\
  \ it but doubts it was the experience that opened my eyes to realize the grandeur\
  \ of our world. \nThis was the most unforgettable day of my traveling history."
