Text: "During one of the coldest nights in South Korea, in 2018, my boyfriend and\
  \ I were looking for something warm to fill up our stomachs. He asked me if I would\
  \ like to have a spiced chicken soup.\nAs I have agreed we went on a journey though\
  \ the darkest alleys in the center of Seoul. I felt like a character from a Korean\
  \ drama who was about to run into a killer. After a while, and many brief stops\
  \ after almost falling due to the slippery streets, we finally arrived in front\
  \ of a narrow metal door were some men were smoking. We passed by those men and\
  \ got into a very busy restaurant.\nThe steam of the food on the tables, and from\
  \ the doorless kitchen, took over the entire place; the sound of conversations had\
  \ everyone screaming every time they needed something from the old ladies serving\
  \ the place. \nWe sat down at one of the smallest tables I have ever seen so I had\
  \ to sit on top of my own coat as there was no where else for it.\nThe soup got\
  \ to our table incredibly fast. The fisrt bites were fine, but soon enough I was\
  \ feeling too hot and couldn't get enough water. \nWhenever I remind myself from\
  \ this place I miss how live it was and how good the food tasted. The only thing\
  \ I don't miss about it was the toilet in the middle of the restaurant which was\
  \ only hidden by a door and was equipped with one of those old Asian toilets that\
  \ are actually just small holes on the floor.\nAfter leaving the place, my boyfriend\
  \ told me that place was actually a very old restaurant which was very much unknown\
  \ by most Seoul habitats, so it was obvious why there weren't any foreigners in\
  \ there - I was the only one, so I had many customers staring at me. :)\nAs I am\
  \ going back to Korea this summer, I hope I can visit this same restaurant again."
