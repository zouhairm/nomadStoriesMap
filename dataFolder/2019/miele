Text: "I knew it wasn\u2019t good the moment I heard the sobbing outside of my room.\
  \ A most gentle, quiet, almost repressed sobbing. I had left behind at Nova Icaria\
  \ the bristly sandy breeze, the merriment of beach-goers, and the penetrating warmth\
  \ of the sun only to be met with the grayness that filled this house. All in the\
  \ company of strangers. The sobbing continued later that evening as I folded and\
  \ packed away my gently worn shorts and t-shirt, but I refused to step out to interrupt\
  \ what I imagined was a private family matter. Even though Fernando and Paolo had\
  \ demonstrated to be perfectly friendly and likable people, they were still strangers\
  \ to me. I refused to engage. \n\nThe radiance that pierced through my bedroom window\
  \ the next morning made me question whether or not I had given Barcelona enough\
  \ time. Though at the same time, I felt like an intruder. So, I carried on with\
  \ my departure plans, but not before an unknown impulse compelled me to do what\
  \ I did. I nervously broke the ice with one of my hosts as I was finishing breakfast.\
  \ He sat across the room with his laptop in front of him, clacking away at the keyboard.\
  \ But I wondered if his mind was elsewhere.\n\n\u201CFernando,\u201D I started,\
  \ \u201CIs everything ok? Last night I thought I heard crying.\u201D I regretted\
  \ my decision almost instantly. Miele, my hosts\u2019 stunning, impeccably white\
  \ Persian cat was quickly losing his battle at a nearby veterinary hospital. This\
  \ explained the mysterious pee accident I had discovered with my bare feet two days\
  \ earlier. A lump began to tightly form in my throat, and I could already feel the\
  \ tears creeping up. As Fernando proceeded to open up his heart, I learned that\
  \ Miele was in fact his partner Paolo\u2019s cat. He had been passed down by his\
  \ mother just before she passed. It was clear in that moment that this was more\
  \ than someone\u2019s dying pet. This was a piece of Paolo\u2019s mother that had\
  \ lived on long after she died. He was now on the verge of losing what was left\
  \ of her. Our conversation was abruptly cut short as Paolo entered the room and\
  \ greeted me with an obligatory \u201Cgood morning\u201D. I returned the greeting\
  \ and took a sip of my coffee, noticing through the window what a gorgeously bright\
  \ day this would be again for Barcelonians and tourists alike.  \n\nWith backpack\
  \ and suitcase packed to the seams, I took one last look around the room to make\
  \ sure nothing of mine was left behind. I found both my hosts in the living room,\
  \ but Miele was still nowhere in sight. I had no idea if this meant that the worst\
  \ had happened by now. What was evident was the emptiness in Paolo\u2019s eyes.\
  \ When our eyes met, I started to make my way toward him. And without a single word\
  \ I hugged this stranger I had only met a few days earlier. Our embrace was firm\
  \ and steady. Very unlike my typical, socially awkward \u201CI-just-met-you\u201D\
  \ hug that I would normally give someone. I wanted to be sure he knew I hurt with\
  \ him. And his quiet cries on my shoulder let me know that we were on the same page.\
  \ \n\nI was risking missing my train, but I didn\u2019t care. Blue skies and a light\
  \ spring breeze surely enveloped all of Barcelona that morning, but I didn\u2019\
  t care. I didn\u2019t feel I was missing out on anything. I was where I needed to\
  \ be in that moment \u2013 a world away from home in the middle of one of most love-filled\
  \ hugs I have ever shared with another human being. Willingly taking part in his\
  \ darkness."
