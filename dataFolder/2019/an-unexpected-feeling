Text: "I did not think it could exist\nIt was 16 pm. I had just landed at the airport\
  \ and still did not believe it. When you fly for 14 hours, you arrive tired but\
  \ happy, because you do not know what you will find. It's a fantastic feeling that\
  \ reaches your heart and fills you with adrenaline. You can not wait to get off\
  \ and run towards the exit! The only thing you want is to see what awaits you once\
  \ outside. And I did not think there could be such a place. I did not think it could\
  \ provoke those reactions in me ...\nLanded in Bangkok, I did not know what to expect.\n\
  in the internet I had only seen some photos of the crystalline sea, imagining myself\
  \ on those white beaches to sunbathe.\nBut who could believe that in the end my\
  \ life would have changed completely?\nNot me. \nYet it took only a few seconds\
  \ to change my mind: first I did not even know where Thailand was.\nA month later\
  \ I found myself there, ready to welcome with open arms any sensation coming straight\
  \ to my heart. It was like a warm wind that caressed my face.\nThere, in that wonderful\
  \ land with its thousand smiles and its thousand colors, I realized that my life\
  \ could have been enriched with thousands of fantastic moments: when you travel\
  \ and meet new cultures something happens to you. Something extraordinary.\nYou\
  \ can not understand it, neither can the others.\nOnly you know what happens to\
  \ you.\nInside you, you think you never got to travel, you stayed at home and you\
  \ were satisfied with what you had.\nIn Thailand I spent 17 wonderful days: I visited\
  \ temples, monuments, rice fields, shot in the car with a fantastic guide, savored\
  \ local food, made thousands of photos...and I fell in love!\nPeople have a beautiful\
  \ sweet face. They warm your heart by giving you their best smile.\nThais are colorful\
  \ and multi-toned people. Walking through the streets I jumped in the eyes all those\
  \ wonderful bright colors of the stalls: the clothes, the souvenirs, the decorations\
  \ of the temples embellished with gold .... And the color also dominated outside\
  \ Bangkok.\nAfter staying a few days in the capital, I took the car to taste even\
  \ better the uncontaminated, tropical and green nature. I did not believe there\
  \ were such beautiful flowers. I heard birds sing and many other sounds; it was\
  \ a crazy situation.\nAs the fabulous landscapes flowed through my eyes, leaning\
  \ my head against the window, I thought how lucky I was to be there in that car.\n\
  I had the chance to travel and I was happy!\nI finally arrived in a particular place,\
  \ where I had the privilege of seeing the famous giraffe women: extraordinary women\
  \ with necks stretched by heavy iron rings, a practice used several years ago. I\
  \ was thrilled by the story of our Thai guide who made us understand how it worked.\
  \ We walked through the small village and saw young girls with their children. I\
  \ approached to greet one and saw that he had a strange ointment in his face. I\
  \ asked her what it was and she replied that it was a natural remedy against mosquitoes:\
  \ that was one of the most significant moments for me. I lived on my skin an \"\
  intimate\" moment with a person of different customs. He took some of the cream\
  \ with his fingers and put it in his face. Immediately afterwards he told me: \"\
  You are really beautiful like that\"\nI laughed. I was happy.\nA few days later\
  \ I was in Chang Rai. I got out of the car and was kidnapped by the extraordinary\
  \ spectacle I had in front of me: the beautiful temple of Wat Arun or the famous\
  \ \"white temple\", famous for its strange and imaginative decorations.\nIt's that\
  \ kind of temple you would never think of meeting in your life.\nI stood still and\
  \ incredulous in front of that sight. I do not know if you have had the chance to\
  \ see it but if you have not been there yet, trust me, you will be amazed."
