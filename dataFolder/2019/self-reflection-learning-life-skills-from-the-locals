Text: "Once the plane landed in Medell\xEDn, fear began to balloon in me. My mom made\
  \ sure I knew every crime that occurred in Colombia within the past 12 months before\
  \ I left; all which were easier to dismiss while I was safe in a city I knew. Now\
  \ that I was in what was once the murder capital of the world, every violent act\
  \ my mom described came back vividly. The large police presence didn't do much to\
  \ soothe the anxiety. Silently muttering all the prayers I knew, I joined the queue\
  \ for taxis.  As we were zooming down towards the city, I tried striking a conversation\
  \ with my driver to ease the feeling of imminent doom. He became excited once he\
  \ learned it was my first time in the country and I knew rudimentary Spanish. He\
  \ recommended various activities and restaurants I had to experience during my stay.\
  \ His enthusiasm and love for his city was palpable. He was eager to show it off\
  \ to the rest of the world. At various points he event stopped so I could take in\
  \ the views and record what I was seeing. I felt welcomed. And ashamed. The media\
  \ often paints the Global South in black and white; dangerous or safe. I should\
  \ have known better than to judge. \n\nAfter settling in at my hostel, I was ready\
  \ to explore. On my way to the metro station to meet my friend, I hopelessly lost\
  \ my way. After 20 minutes of walking in what felt to be the wrong way, I gave in\
  \ and asked someone for directions. He didn't just point to where it was, he insisted\
  \ on walking with me to make sure I arrived at the station safely. While walking,\
  \ we began to talk - me in Spanish, he in English. While neither of us was anywhere\
  \ near close to fluency in the other's language, we made it work. He told me about\
  \ his life and was curious about mine. After reaching the train station, I thanked\
  \ him profusely for taking the time to show me where the station was located. It\
  \ really made me think about my interactions with tourists in my city. Instead of\
  \ complaining about how slow they walk, maybe I should practice patience. Instead\
  \ of just pointing people in the right direction, maybe I should walk a few blocks\
  \ with them. It's scary being in a new place, especially if you don't speak the\
  \ new language. I could be more helpful to tourists in my city. \n\nAfter the train\
  \ ride, I went to meet up with my friend who had already been in Colombia for a\
  \ few days. She needed a new pair of jeans and was convinced Colombian-made jeans\
  \ would highlight her booty best (side note: she was right). While she was trying\
  \ on pants, the shopkeepers struck up a conversation with me. They with three young\
  \ men, around the same age as me, who'd never left Medell\xEDn. As they saw me struggling\
  \ with Spanish, they began to speak in English. Their English was worse than my\
  \ Spanish, but they were still willing to try. My lack of conversational Spanish\
  \ skills was causing me to grow increasingly embarrassed, yet they embraced their\
  \ flawed English, and instead of switching back to their mother tongue, they insisted\
  \ on persevering. Despite the fact that I was the one exploring a new country, they\
  \ were the ones full of adventure, immersing themselves in a new language. I decided\
  \ I should not be overly conscious either and jumped back into the conversation,\
  \ making all sorts of mistakes. We laughed at each other and with each other. Once\
  \ I decided to let go, I began having a much better time and felt more engaged.\
  \ I didn't have to be perfect, but I did need to put in some effort. \n\nI expected\
  \ to come back more worldly from my trip. I didn't expect to come back a better\
  \ person. I thank the Colombians who guided me for teaching me how to be better,\
  \ both abroad and at home."
