Text: "My husband and I followed a wall with ivy snaking along each brick until it\
  \ dipped gradually down, revealing Sorrento a thousand feet below. Through a line\
  \ of trees, the setting sun glinted gold on the bay. I inhaled, trying to harness\
  \ the moment.\n\nAt the end of the path, the foliage gave way to a quaint village.\
  \ We strolled the cobblestone streets, glancing in shop windows and observing the\
  \ community. Locals greeted one another, conversing heartily without a glance at\
  \ a phone or watch.\n\nWe approached a storefront window with shelves of Limoncello\
  \ in artistic glass containers, neon liquid highlighting the dim backdrop. Close\
  \ to the doorway, a long-haired black dog rested his muzzle on the curb with a calico\
  \ cat snuggled into him, black fur cascading over her like a blanket. The final\
  \ pack member, a cute Chow mix with a toothy grin, stood expectantly with his tail\
  \ flailing and his front paws at the door jamb.\n\nAlthough the door was wide open,\
  \ no animal entered, as if a magic spell shrouded the place.\n\nWe petted each furry\
  \ head before walking in. My heart tugged as it always does when meeting homeless\
  \ animals. We smiled sadly at one another.\n\nA young woman in an apron and bouncy\
  \ ponytail greeted us. I inquired about the Limoncello in a bottle shaped like a\
  \ cello (I\u2019ve always been a sucker for a good pun). She took it down from the\
  \ shelf and handed it to me.\n\n\u201CIs that your dog?\u201D My husband motioned\
  \ to the Chow.\n\nShe shook her head. \u201CNo, no.\u201D She gestured her hands\
  \ in a circular motion and said something in Italian, then translated: \u201CHe\
  \ is all our dog.\u201D Her arms went wide, indicating the street front. \u201C\
  Bruno,\u201D she said, pointing to the smiling mutt. \u201CBuio, and cat is Bella.\u201D\
  \n\nShe spoke to Bruno in Italian and his tail picked up speed. I motioned to the\
  \ Limoncello in my hands. \u201CQuanto costa?\u201D\n\nShe put up one finger, a\
  \ question on her face, and walked to the rear of the store. We heard her speak\
  \ to another woman before returning with a bowl in hand.\n\n\u201C17 Euro,\u201D\
  \ she said. Then, she scooched passed us and walked out to the street. All the animals\
  \ stood at attention. \u201CBruno! Buio!\u201D The little pack followed to where\
  \ she was scattering meat from the bowl.\n\n\u201COh my God,\u201D I whispered.\
  \ \u201CThere\u2019s going to be a brawl.\u201D \n\nWe watched intently as Bruno\
  \ stayed back, tail still wagging, while Buio nibbled bits of meat and Bella nosed\
  \ at it. When Buio had gotten his fair share, he stepped aside and Bruno finished\
  \ up.\n\nThis selflessness baffled me.\n\nThe young woman smiled at us as she came\
  \ back to the doorway. \u201CBella!\u201D she called. The cat came running, entering\
  \ the store as if the spell had been broken. She jumped up on a nearby shelf and\
  \ devoured an open can of tuna while I paid at the counter.\n\nAs I slipped the\
  \ Limoncello in my bag, a choir of voices rose up behind us. Even in Italian, I\
  \ immediately recognized it as a Catholic hymn. Eight priests, dressed in maroon\
  \ robes, led a group of congregation workers and townspeople, some holding books\
  \ of prayer or giant wooden crosses while others held torches. They walked methodically,\
  \ singing as they made their way down the long narrow street to a stone church.\n\
  \n\u201CNight mass,\u201D the young lady said.\n\n\u201CEvery night?\u201D I asked.\n\
  \nShe nodded and gave a little wave. \u201CCiao.\u201D\n\n\u201CCiao,\u201D we echoed.\n\
  \nAs we returned to the walking path, we spied Buio, Bella, and old Bruno making\
  \ their way to the next storefront. An elderly couple welcomed them, chatting with\
  \ the pack like they were old friends. Bruno smiled. The man stepped back into the\
  \ restaurant and returned with a plate of food. \n\nI glanced back at the scene,\
  \ wondering if this isolated haven represented what the world was capable of."
