Text: "You can find yourself or you can find another part of yourself. You can try\
  \ to get all you want or you just have a look and yourself comes in the eyes of\
  \ a local taxi driver in kathmandu that explain you that life can change in one\
  \ second, like this. In nepal you don't need to talk, you need to see. Nepal teached\
  \ me one thing: if you open your eyes time is just an illusion, you don't have to\
  \ look at clock, you just live the moment and enjoy life. In nepal you arrive and\
  \ lose yourself in a bus in a street in a temple. They don't speak much English,\
  \ so you 'll learn to find yourself alone, and understand that efforts are the meaning\
  \ of a trip. I decided to take local bus, go on the market, live in the nepali house,\
  \ meditate in the temple, eat on the road, enjoy the traffic jam, smile in front\
  \ of the pollution. You will wallk in the middle of nowhere, you will feel in old\
  \ middle age, without shops, bank, iPhone. You will be between Budda and Shiva,\
  \ lord Krishna and Hanuman. They sayed: we are like a flowers born in the middle\
  \ of two stones, one chineese and one Hindi. They smile, and they work every day,\
  \ to get 20 dollars a month. They invite you at home, they enjoy with you a cup\
  \ of tea and they are curious, they wanna know you, what brings you there. \nNepal\
  \ has his own big energy, made of music, food, meditation, culture and architecture,\
  \ peace and tollerance. Nepal has no roads, but mountains, and they show you the\
  \ sky, the sun and the love. Pure unconditional love. There, out of your efforts,\
  \ out of your comfort.zone, exist one love, that is one language, one peaople, one\
  \ face. Out of your thoughts exist something without time, something without beginning\
  \ and end. Everything, has one home, one place where to live, and is called heart.\
  \ Inside your heart you will find what you were looking for travelling around the\
  \ world. Be in peace, is a magic atmosphere that I realized in the middle of noise,\
  \ in kathmandu. I found history in Baghtapur, architecture in Patan, middle age\
  \ in Kirtipur, simplicity in Pushapatinath, kindness in Boudhnath, love waiting\
  \ the bus, gratitude enjoying a chai with okd mens in the street. \nYou will meet\
  \ sadhu, bhramin, monks, simple mens in the taxi and in the market wiser then others.\
  \ You will lose your belonging at your country when you bring in the backpack just\
  \ your eyes. In the children, in the women, in the street, inside the poor reality\
  \ you will find richness. Everything is in front of you, this moment. Inside you,\
  \ forever. \nIn the house in nepal.they dont care about hot water, they bring water\
  \ from the street, from the lake. They don't need heater. They don't need English\
  \ to communicate, enough is a simple gaze. Compassion travel inside your shoes when\
  \ you open your heart. In the bus, you are almost without air, is not cleaned and\
  \ has no air condition. But, if you leave mobile phone, money and kacket they run\
  \ to give you back all. Simplify our life is this. Be together, hel each other,\
  \ be happy of what we have. Food is very spicy, sometimes too much. If you ask no\
  \ spicy, they will no understand. If you ask hot water, they will no understand.\
  \ If you accept what you don't like, you'll become a guru of yourself. That's what\
  \ they teached me. Be in silence, don't be stressed, take it easy, don't run, have\
  \ a relaxing time every day, a coffee with friends, walking in the nature, enjoying\
  \ the sun. \"Life is what happened while you are making other plans. \".John Lennon.\
  \  \"Life is too important to take it seriously\". Oscar Wilde.\nI enjoy bed without\
  \ bed. Nepal is a big simle of Budda that make in one second a true sense of the\
  \ whole life. Is a. Monkey that push me to have my food. Is be patient and tollerant.Our\
  \ Life is a part of the world, is not the world.love"
