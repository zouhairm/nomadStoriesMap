Text: "Jolly Harbour is not exactly the best name for the Americanized, gated community\
  \ for retirees, but it did have the best Airbnb prices. Situated on the West Coast\
  \ of the Caribbean island, Antigua, we jokingly called this community, \u201CSleepy\
  \ Harbour.\u201D It has its own grocery store, ATM machines, your fair share tourist\
  \ traps, too many speed-bumps, and we called home for two weeks. \n\nFour of us\
  \ from Mississauga flew from Toronto\u2019s Pearson International Airport, not in\
  \ search of a beach getaway from the cold Canadian winter, but to visit our good\
  \ friend Kris. Kris has lived in Canada since he was 18 and needed to return home\
  \ to Antigua and Barbuda to complete his Permanent Residency application with the\
  \ Canadian Government. We thought it would be the perfect chance to see where he\
  \ was from and maybe (definitely) enjoy the beautiful beaches of Antigua.\n\nWe\
  \ did all the things that you would expect a group of five, twenty-somethings to\
  \ do. We cruised the island\u2019s turquoise waters, danced in Half Moon Bay with\
  \ a crew from a chartered yacht, and partied the night away at the Shirley Heights\
  \ Lookout in English Harbour. \n\nThe morning-after, we would lounge on our town\
  \ house patio, sip delicious coffee, and relive the evening\u2019s events while\
  \ staring at the mesmerizing clear blue water with the lapping of the waves soothing\
  \ any discomfort we may have felt. \n\nWe didn\u2019t sit long, we had places to\
  \ go! Packing ourselves into an electric blue Jeep Wrangler, we headed out to Gina\u2019\
  s \u2013 our morning ritual. Driving on the left side, in sweltering heat, we passed\
  \ the lavish condo gardens in Jolly Harbour, houses on stilts outside of the gated\
  \ community, and natives casually walking the streets, machetes in tow. Driving\
  \ along the coast we could just make out the foggy outlines of Montserrat and Guadeloupe\
  \ while cars tooted friendly honks to those who passed. \n\n\u201CMy friends!\u201D\
  \ Gina would call to us when we pulled up to her yellow, wooden kiosk. Decorated\
  \ with pineapples, watermelons, bananas and the words \u201CGod is love\u201D and\
  \ \u201Cpeace, hope, joy, love, faith and grace;\u201D this was \u201CGina\u2019\
  s Shop.\u201D \n\nThis little store on the side of the road, close to the beach,\
  \ was the only place we wanted to eat. Not because we couldn\u2019t find good food\
  \ elsewhere on the island, but because of the relationship we built with Gina and\
  \ her family. Each day she would tell us when to arrive so that we would be get\
  \ the daily special before she ran out. Fall-off-the-bone jerk chicken with Gina\u2019\
  s home-made hot sauce (only a drop or two), Goat Water (a stew that was so good\
  \ it often sold out before 8:00am), sweet plantains and the world\u2019s best Rice\
  \ Pudding! \n\nWe could spend hours at a time here, playing and reading with six-year-old\
  \ Kiante, he loved to yell \u201Cmore white people!\u201D when tourists came by.\
  \ A lot of personality for a six-year-old. \n\nDuring our time with Gina and her\
  \ family, we learned that they had relatives in Hamilton, a suburb very close to\
  \ us, in the Greater Toronto Area; maybe we all had more in common than we thought.\
  \ \n\nThroughout our trip, with Kris as our unofficial tour guide, we experienced\
  \ authentic, Antiguan culture, and were introduce to his lovely family. However,\
  \ Gina was the experience that stood out. It was a very natural relationship that\
  \ we developed with these locals. They showed us unexpected hospitality. They had\
  \ no obligation to give us such a warm welcome and they gave us the chance to learn\
  \ that the Caribbean should be known for more than just their beaches. \n\nWhile\
  \ in search of food and a cold Wadadli, we had made friends at a shack on the side\
  \ of the road in Antigua. Every time I look at the picture of us and Gina Thomas\u2019\
  \ family outside the shop, I can still feel the tang of her hot sauce and her warmer,\
  \ welcoming smile."
