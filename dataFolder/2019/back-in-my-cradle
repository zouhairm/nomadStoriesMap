Text: 'Two years ago I went to visit Lisbon with my schoolmates for our last year
  of high school. It was simply incredible! That was the last adventure of the old
  me, because when we came back we all changed: the final exams were close and we
  never been together in five years like after that trip to Lisbon, I became friends
  with my bullies and I felt happier to go to school but also to go to my music and
  dance class, I didn''t know what I was gonna do after the exams but I knew it was
  gonna be different, I felt the change happening. Well, a couple of weeks after that
  trip I dyed my hair black (and when a girl changes her hair the hurricane is already
  happening), I passed my exams, found the love of my life in a beautiful woman who
  made me jump out of the closet and question all previous decisions...Skipping forward
  to now: I am a military wife, living in Florida, doing what I love and traveling
  with her around this beautiful side of the world, but always missing home, missing
  my Italy and all the things I did or did not discover. What would this trip to Portugal
  represent to me? I don''t know, that''s what I''m curious to know. Who will I find?
  Myself in the past, in the present or in a new future?'
