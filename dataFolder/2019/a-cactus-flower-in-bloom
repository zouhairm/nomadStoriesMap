Text: "I was about to hit the Arizona border from Southern Utah when the monsoon hit.\
  \ I grew up in a small logging town in Western Washington just south of the Olympic\
  \ National Forest so I am no stranger to relentless downpouring rain. Pink Floyd\
  \ played in synchronicity with dazzling lightning bolts that periodically dominated\
  \ the sky.  However, I have to admit I was slightly intimidated as we passed \"\
  Flash Flood Warning\" signs, my husband growing sleepy eyed in the passenger seat\
  \ while I gripped the steering wheel tighter than usual. \n\"Is that going to happen\
  \ any time soon?\" I wondered. On a subconscious level, I was looking for this.\
  \ There is an unspoken magic of the desert, that is why so many people write about\
  \ it the way an artist emanates their invisible muse. Those of us who are drawn\
  \ to the unknown are equally drawn to the feeling of vulnerability. As I drove through\
  \ that blackened highway, I became increasingly aware of my own mortality. \nWe\
  \ stopped in Moab, UT earlier that day. I once worked at a used, non profit bookstore\
  \ that ran primarily on donations. I was fortunate enough to sort through the donations,\
  \ set aside whatever book I found appealing and pay for it another time. I think\
  \ I became one of those people who bought books for the sake of owning them, my\
  \ personal stack in the back room increasing simultaneously with my thirst for knowledge.\
  \ One of the books that caught my eye was \"Desert Solitaire\" by Edward Abbey.\
  \ A part of me has always felt sheltered by this lush, temperate rainforest that\
  \ I call my home. There is a whole other world out there, wide open spaces... the\
  \ desert. It was the opposite of everything I had ever known. I was immediately\
  \ drawn to it. After reading the novel, I couldn't stop daydreaming about Utah.\
  \ It was Mars and I was Major Tom. Commencing countdown, engines on.\nYou would\
  \ think that my favorite part of Moab was the otherworldly Arches National Park,\
  \ but it wasn't. It was on the outside and it was a direct pull-out from the highway.\
  \ This was the moment I truly enjoyed the most simply because of its spontaneity.\
  \ I am thoroughly convinced that some of the best (and probably the worst) moments\
  \ in our lives happen when we least expect them. You can see it from the small parking\
  \ lot, Wilson's Arch. The parking lot itself looks like a spot where slow drivers\
  \ would pull over and lost travelers would turn around. Low and behold, if you take\
  \ the time to stop, there is a trail. It's a quintessential slick rock trail of\
  \ Southern Utah, so it's not actually a marked trail like you would expect in the\
  \ vegetative landscape of my home state, it's more of an invitation. Halfway through\
  \ I opted out of wearing shoes. Our feet were better adapted for walking on this\
  \ liveless soil than my look-alike Vans sneakers. Then I felt it... I felt the earth\
  \ under my feet in a way I hadn't known before. There is nothing but the earth in\
  \ it's most purest form. Earth that has been casted and changed by the surprising\
  \ power of water that shapes our land, by the mistress of time. Endurance. Perseverance.\
  \ Adaptability. That is what I believe in, what keeps me alive. I daydream of that\
  \ immaculate place the way I once pondered of it years ago...\n\nIn my mind there\
  \ is music\nfrom a dusty apartment\nit drowns the noise of the city\nin sound wave\
  \ after sound wave\nI am swimming in a bottle of wine\nI close my eyes and I am\
  \ carried\nto massive red canyons\nthe hot desert dirt on my naked feet\ndelighted\
  \ at the sign of new life\na friend in the sparseness and desolation\nI am a cactus\
  \ flower in bloom\n\nAs each plant held it's own place in the stark and wondrously\
  \ strange world of the Utah desert, I found mine."
