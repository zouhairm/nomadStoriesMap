Text: "\"We have to hurry!\", Fang loudly whispered to me. We had struck up a conversation\
  \ at the hostel where she worked and a little over an hour later, I ended up pushing\
  \ my way into a crowded temple gate with someone I barely knew. She stepped to the\
  \ side and carefully leaned her still folded up paper lantern on a tree and instructed\
  \ me to do the same. \"They are not allowed inside the temple complex,\" her way\
  \ of explaining what she was doing. I obediently followed her example. She then\
  \ saw I had my shopping bag with my krathong inside. \"You can bring that in, it's\
  \ fine.\" I trusted her, not having any choice, and did as was told.\n\nFang's small\
  \ frame easily passed through gaps in the crowd and I squeezed myself in after her,\
  \ afraid to get lost and at the same time excited by the palpable energy in the\
  \ warm night. With no idea what was happening or what to expect, I followed Fang\
  \ as she lead me nearer and nearer to a massive tree, colorful lanterns decorated\
  \ its branches giving the scene a whimsical air.  \n\nIt was my first backpacking\
  \ trip without any detailed plans and as luck would have it, I arrived in Chiang\
  \ Mai in time for the celebrations. With Fang's enthusiastic explanations, I learned\
  \ that Chiang Mai was celebrating two festivals. The first was the Loy Krathong\
  \ which literally means \"floating banana trunk\". Fang gave me discs of banana\
  \ trunks which I had to decorate with folded up banana leaves, fresh flowers and\
  \ candles, all secured by small bamboo sticks. I went about folding the intricate\
  \ designs and thoroughly enjoyed the idea of making something beautiful and have\
  \ it float down the river Ping. The second festival, Yi Peng or the lantern festival\
  \ is ubiquitous in Asia, celebrated in countries like Taiwan, Korea and Myanmar.\
  \ Lanterns are lit and released into the sky in the thousands. \n\nThe festivals\
  \ are religious occasions and this why Fang found it necessary for me to start the\
  \ festival by joining hundreds of people in Wat Phan Tao temple to hear the monks\
  \ pray. The crowd was respectful and patiently waited for the ceremony to start.\
  \ We sat on the dusty ground, different nationalities united by the same goal, eagerly\
  \ waiting, with me waving my fan frantically to get some air flowing. We waited\
  \ until whispers of \"the monk is coming, it will begin shortly\" started to be\
  \ heard and finally, monks slowly paraded to the base of the huge tree, arranged\
  \ themselves majestically into their meditation poses as a senior monk started chanting\
  \ prayers. It was solemn and beautiful. Fang explained that the prayers were not\
  \ in Thai, that they were in an older language. I did not understand the prayer\
  \ but I felt it in my heart.\n\nAs the ceremony drew to a close, Fang motioned for\
  \ me to start moving towards the gate. We collected our lanterns and started the\
  \ trek to the Ping River where the crowds had started releasing lanterns. There\
  \ was a sense of camaraderie as people cheered for successful launches and commiserated\
  \ with the ones that crashed into the water after being sent up too early. We lit\
  \ our lanterns and when we felt the tug of warm air wishing to rise, we let them\
  \ go along with our wishes and hopes for a better tomorrow. We watched as thousands\
  \ of lanterns lit the sky like twinkling stars, it was magical. \n\nFang then brought\
  \ me to the riverbank and explained that traditionally, nail clippings and hair\
  \ are placed on the krathong with the idea that by floating them down the river,\
  \ the people show respect and gratitude to the life-giving river, while also asking\
  \ for forgiveness for misdeeds. I lit the candle on my krathong and placed it carefully\
  \ on the water, reflecting on the symbolism and appreciating the chance to wash\
  \ sins away. It was an actual letting go of the bad and welcoming the new and the\
  \ good. \n\n\"Do not look at your krathong,\" I heard Fang say. I smiled. By then,\
  \ Fang was no longer a stranger. I looked her squarely and said, \"Khob khon ka.\""
