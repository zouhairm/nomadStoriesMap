Text: "After around four hours sitting inside an aircraft from a six-hour flight,\
  \ I looked through the window and I saw mountains blanketed with white snow. I knew\
  \ I am close to my destination and my excitement went up through the roof. When\
  \ I landed, all my feelings could be expressed as \"My vacation is finally here,\
  \ no skyscrapers and fast-paced metropolitan life, life couldn't be better than\
  \ this\". However, not everything went well as I planned. The problem emerged in\
  \ passport control; yea the struggle of third-world passport holder when entering\
  \ first world countries, is real. In my case in Bulgaria.\n\nI do not have a free-visa\
  \ to Bulgaria, but I did apply for the visa process and obtained the visa. I have\
  \ valid proof of everything needed, yet the visa stamp from their embassy seems\
  \ to not be enough. I was being held in the office, perhaps the passengers from\
  \ three other flights that arrived after me have checked out and left the airport\
  \ and I was still there sitting on the bench looking at the passport control booth\
  \ while other passengers keep on passing by and wondering what kind of crime did\
  \ I commit into. Beside me, there is also a young adult who was being held, from\
  \ the passport color I could guess he is from one of the countries in Africa.  I\
  \ could guess that his age is around 21. We didn't go have any conversation. I can\
  \ see he is upset from his facial reaction. Deep inside I wanna tell him I feel\
  \ the same as well.\n\nAfter sitting there for quite a whole. the officer finally\
  \ arrived. I was being guided to another office. It was empty there, there were\
  \ two computers but only both of us were inside. I was being interrogated but I\
  \ did not panic, I know the struggle is just real even though I did not expect this\
  \ scenario. I was asked about the reason why I come while he kept on flipping my\
  \ passport pages. While explaining the reason he saw a Swiss visa there and asked\
  \ what did I do there. For the study, I replied. Again another question such as\
  \ where am I gonna stay, my return ticket and how much money I bring keep on coming.\
  \ Given a valid proof and answered everything he asked me to wait outside the office\
  \ while another staff entered the room and they were discussing something over my\
  \ passport. No longer than five minutes he came out and my passport was finally\
  \ stamped and I was allowed to pass by the immigration. I felt so relieved and keep\
  \ positive thought that this will be the only worst part of my vacation, the rest\
  \ will turn out great.\n\nFrom the airport, I took a taxi and showed the taxi driver\
  \ the location of my apartment that I booked through airbnb. Another problem came\
  \ as the address did not include the number, only the name of the street. I convinced\
  \ him to just drive through there and we will figure it out later. I thought it\
  \ would be that easy. I was not that wrong, arriving in the street and this country\
  \ for the first time I did not have any internet nor did I buy any card in the airport\
  \ to be able to make a phone call to the host. The only thing that I prepared was\
  \ the screenshot of the location and the number of my host. \n\nMy vacation did\
  \ not start that smooth but I know it would end up good. The odds be in my favor,\
  \ I knew it as the cab driver was willing to call the host and explain the whole\
  \ situation to him. Sofia was welcoming me with snow, even though I did not like\
  \ snow that much but it just feels really welcoming and I felt so peaceful. I spent\
  \ my nine days in Sofia just wondering around the city without any fear that I would\
  \ get lost in between the street. I really had a great time there and regardless\
  \ of the trouble I faced in the airport, I did leave a piece of my heart in Sofia."
