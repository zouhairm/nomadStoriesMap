Text: "It was the summer of 2017, and just like everyone else my girls and I had the\
  \ same plan, to get that summer tan, and while Bali and the Andaman Islands felt\
  \ too heavy on the pocket, Goa seemed more in reach. Thus the inevitable Goa whatsapp\
  \ group was created. One week of planning and the reality started sinking in, one\
  \ by one everyone backed out leaving my friend and I to fend for ourselves. Goa\
  \ now seemed like a far-fetched dream, and the infamous Parvati Valley seemed more\
  \ chill for just us two. We had heard from our friends that there is a waterfall,\
  \ called the Kheerganga waterfall, in the Parvati Valley, which would be a four\
  \ hour hike and should not be missed. Thus the whole plan was made around it. It\
  \ was the last week of June with the monsoon just around the corner, we knew it\
  \ would be tough to hike if in case it rained, but we took our chances. We did our\
  \ research and found that on our way to the village, Barshaini (where the hike to\
  \ Kheerganga begins) we would be passing by the villages, Kasol, Manikaran, and\
  \ Tosh. Since there were no direct buses to either of these places, we booked a\
  \ bus for the 23rd of June, leaving from Kashmere gate, Delhi at around 11:00 in\
  \ the night which would drop us in the morning at around 11 at Bhuntar, a town roughly\
  \ an hour away from Kasol. It\u2019s a 12 hour journey from Delhi to Bhuntar, and\
  \ being wiser and with the intention of saving time, we booked an overnight bus,\
  \ so we would have more time the next day to go around. Local buses for barshaini\
  \ (which is the last stop) leave every half hour from Bhuntar, we therefore had\
  \ no trouble catching a bus. We spent a day each in kasol and Tosh (a 10 min walk\
  \ from barshaini) on our way. After relaxing for a good two days, early morning\
  \ we started for our hike to the kheerganga. It\u2019s a 14 km hike from Barshaini.\
  \ The Hike was difficult to say the least, laden with difficult terrain and rocks,\
  \ we would often have to get down on all fours and make our way uphill, using the\
  \ branches of trees and plants as support. There are two routes to reach the waterfall,\
  \ one from the inside which is relatively easier, as the other one goes around the\
  \ hill, with narrower paths and nothing but what seemed like a fall of 1000s of\
  \ feet on the one side. But the hike was worth every bit, as I went along I took\
  \ mental pictures of the mesmerising views that the kheerganga hike offered, with\
  \ gorgeous deodhar trees lined along the pathway. Halfway through the hike falls\
  \ the  kheerganga waterfall, we rested here for some 30 mins, soaking our feet in\
  \ the clear water of the kheerganga. The trail becomes a tad difficult after crossing\
  \ the waterfall, though the paths are well marked there is little chance of one\
  \ losing their way, the uphill climb however is definitely tiring. It's another\
  \ 7 km to the top and after a 7 hour long hike we were lucky enough to reach the\
  \ top while the Sun was still up. Catching our breaths we laid down on the grass\
  \ and saw snow capped hills surrounding us on three sides, and clouds sitting on\
  \ top of them like crowns. It was the most beautiful thing I had seen till then,\
  \ but then again it was my first hike. On our way up, we had overheard a passerby\
  \ telling someone else to turn back around, and that they'd be disappointed if they\
  \  continued up, I  wonder if he would have had waited just a little while longer\
  \ he would never want to leave this place. We rented tents for the night and the\
  \ next morning packed up stuff and startes downhill. We were lucky enough to catch\
  \ the last bus leaving at 5:00 in the evening from Barshaini, got down at Kasol\
  \ and spent the night there to relax our aching bodies and the next day carried\
  \ on our way to Delhi."
