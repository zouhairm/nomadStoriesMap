Text: "The End of The Road \u2013 Thailand Connections\n\nMaking connections with\
  \ the locals is easier when your Dad has become one. Our holiday in Thailand was\
  \ punctuated by a replenishing time at the beautiful mud-brick home Dad and his\
  \ partner, Nanna, built. \n\nTheir land in Chum Phae has a river running through\
  \ it and every tropical fruit tree you could imagine planted amongst the teak and\
  \ bamboo. A haven they created that Dad calls \u2018The End of The Road\u2019. I\
  \ hate the name, despite the restful place being literally at the end of the road.\
  \ For me the double meaning - with the suggestion of his life coming to an end -\
  \ is something I choose to live in denial about.\n\nThey spent two years building\
  \ and planting and sculpting the environment, with the locals of Chum Phae coming\
  \ in droves to look at what was happening. The organic approach, the worm farming\
  \ and the irrigation.\n\nNanna\u2019s sister, Nid, loved the miraculous fertiliser\
  \ of worm farming so much, that she began to farm her own worms. Word got around\
  \ that she had some pretty powerful worm juice, and she began to sell it to the\
  \ neighbours. Word got around\u2026 and she got Government support. Nid expanded\
  \ her business and now she provides fertiliser to farmers around Chum Phae.\n\n\
  When Dean (my new partner) and I arrived at \u2018NormandNannaland\u2019 (another\
  \ affectionate name Dad gave the sanctuary) we were greeted by Nanna\u2019s family\
  \ saying, in songful welcoming voices, \u201CSawadee Ka\u201D and \u201CSawadee\
  \ Khrap\u201D. The repetition of \u201CSawadee Ka\u201D and \u201CSawaddee Khraps\u201D\
  \ circulated back and forth between us all repeatedly. Then - and intermittently\
  \ throughout our whole visit. With a smile and a laugh.\n\nThat night Ya (Nanna\u2019\
  s brother in law) cooked for us. Fish he had caught earlier in another nearby river.\
  \ A river we had strolled along in search of Nanna\u2019s fat uncle\u2019s pig farm.\
  \ We had looked out across the sugar plantation, past the soom (Dad\u2019s name\
  \ for a little outdoor room) and heard the rustle and snort of the happy pigs. Fat\
  \ uncle Ha was content as he lay in the shade of the soom, meditating on another\
  \ way he might be able to con my dad.\n\nDean and I sat on cushions surrounded by\
  \ family and friends. We laughed and ate and drank outside amongst the fruit trees\
  \ and bamboo as the sun went down and the plans for our ventures into the local\
  \ community were made. \n\nWhen you have local connections hiring a motorbike aint\
  \ that hard. You just roll up to the neighbour Mad Mal - who has three sitting in\
  \ his loungeroom. The couch and chairs are out front being used by his wife\u2019\
  s extended family as they cook and laugh and chatter in Thai - singing \u201CSawadee\
  \ Ka\u201D and \u201CSawadee Khrap\u201D with a smile as we pass. \n\nDean looks\
  \ bewildered as I ask Dad if the motorbikes are safe. His reply is, \u201CThey\u2019\
  re as safe as any you\u2019ll get around here.\u201D \nI look at him questioningly.\n\
  \u201CNot that you\u2019ll get them anywhere else around here,\u201D he chuckles.\n\
  \nAs Dean tries unsuccessfully to kickstart the bike, Dad cheers him on saying,\
  \ \u201CThat\u2019s it, that\u2019s the way. Keep going.\u201D \n\nAnd Dean did\
  \ keep going until he got the engine turning over. I jumped on the back before it\
  \ konked out again and waved \u201CSawadee Ka\u201D and \u201CSawadee Khrap\u201D\
  \ - laughing with our extended family of onlookers.\n\nWe rode around the countryside\
  \ of Si Chomphu, past concrete and bamboo two-storey houses. The bottom section\
  \ the garage and store room - upstairs the home. Then, to the Buddhist temple. Nanna\u2019\
  s mother is a Buddhist nun \u2013 the temple her home. Her room a separate building,\
  \ small and sparse with just a tiled floor and rattan mat. We sit and bow hello\
  \ to her smiling, gentle face (she was once the beauty queen of Chum Phae), with\
  \ Dad quietly letting us know not to point the souls of our feet towards her. Good\
  \ manners.\n\nOur visit ended in the same nourishing, joyful, soul-replenishing\
  \ vibe \u2013 snuggled together under the mosquito net, the river running past our\
  \ outdoor bed in the soom at \u2018The Last Resort\u2019 (another name I\u2019m\
  \ not sure I like)."
