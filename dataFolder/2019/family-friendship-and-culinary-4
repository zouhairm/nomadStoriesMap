Text: 'It''s been a while, the story begins in 2014 when i was accepted into one of
  Taiwan private universities, never come to my mind if i could get the scholarship,
  time flies so fast until i had to leave my family and the lovely one, in 2015 i
  went to Taiwan with my friends and we didn''t know anything about their tales and
  stories, when we arrived at that time, it was still winter season, we even can''t
  feel the cold(maybe because we were to happy...LOL), but the next morning was the
  hard part, it''s freezing outside.


  The things about Taiwan i love the most are Culinary, Friendship And the Family
  bonds, about culinary, i really miss the chicken crispy(chi phay), the pork rice
  (Paikut fan) and pork rice with soy sauce (lu ro fan), in point of fact i still
  can feel and scent the flavor and delicacy...:D


  Onetime i was following the student trip held by one of Taiwan agencies, it was
  a fun time, i can enjoy the scenery, culture and the most important i get family
  here (foster parents), they treat me like their child, the thing that not everyone
  can get and called "FAMILY".


  About Friends, i got many friends with different and unique characters, i have a
  friend who is a LGBT (no offense) she is kind and cool, right now she move to USA
  (hope you get a nice life :) ), and i have a friend who loves to drunk and easily
  to get mad, but he actually a softhearted and smart man, and the last one, the married
  girl...heheheh... the sweet and helpful, she doesn''t stayed for long term cause
  she moved, for those time when i was there i can feel their kindness and love, such
  a nice friends, thanks for having me...:)'
