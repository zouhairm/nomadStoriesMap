Text: "Every great journey has a message you didn\u2019t know you needed. The Annapurna\
  \ circuit is one of these journeys. Far from the chaotic urban life of Kathmandu\
  \ stands the Annapurna mountain range and city of Pokhara with its idyllic lakes,\
  \ pagodas and exotic wildlife. With a good chance of altitude sickness, frequent\
  \ landslides and treacherous paths the circuit sees daily air rescue missions.\n\
  \nSetting off from Besisahar, the first few days of walking took us through the\
  \ rural village of Karte, past tropical fields, waterfalls and steep Himalayan hillsides.\
  \ From the 1900m elevation of Dharapani the trail is lined with amazing panoramas,\
  \ cliff-side paths and steep but rewarding ascents.\n\nEverything in the Himalayas\
  \ is a half hour walk, regardless of how long it actually ends up taking. We came\
  \ to learn that this is the way of the Nepalese people. Everything they do, they\
  \ do with calm resolve, from driving around narrow cliff-edges to helping less able\
  \ trekkers along the trail. \n\nAs we pushed on with the trail, one of our group\
  \ came down with a violent fever. Mistaking it for acute altitude sickness, he stubbornly\
  \ decided that we should keep going. As we trekked a little further onwards, he\
  \ collapsed and was unable to walk any further. After walking a couple of kilometres\
  \ back on ourselves we set up for the night in an idyllic Himalayan homestay.\n\n\
  Several hours into our stay, the electricity shut off entirely. Ritesh, our host\
  \ told me of the reality of living in such a remote location. He told me of leaving\
  \ the city to find a more peaceful life, and that, however incredible the surroundings,\
  \ you never forget the excitement of Kathmandu and Pokhara.\n\nThat evening while\
  \ lying in bed listening to the Himalayan dogs trying to break into the room, the\
  \ Nepalese sense of fearlessness began to make sense. Life and death is treated\
  \ with a fierce brashness by the Nepali people. Everything from the landscape to\
  \ the weather and even the economy pose a set of extremes which are constantly traversed\
  \ and forgotten about.\n\nAfter arriving at Pisang, a town we had heard much about\
  \ on the treck, we slept solidly until day eight of the treck. Subsequently, we\
  \ passed through a little village named Humde which looks over the world\u2019s\
  \ highest commercial airport. We decided to walk on to Manang and leverage ourselves\
  \ an extra day of acclimatisation. As the final town before the pass, Manang is\
  \ surprisingly large. More surprising is the cinema with a range of disaster movies\
  \ on offer, from Into The Wild, to Everest; the people of Manang take this opportunity\
  \ to make light of the journey ahead.\n\nThe two day treck to the infamous Tilicho\
  \ Lake sounded lengthy and crowded, and the weather was too lousy for it. We opted\
  \ for a less touristy trail past the impossibly blue Gangapurna Lake which led us\
  \ up to 4000m altitude where we could acclimatise for the forthcoming Therong La\
  \ (5416m) pass.\n\nThis route took us past an icy glacier sat behind a mass of alpine\
  \ trees. The view of the lake, glacier and highest city I\u2019ve ever been to,\
  \ built up to one of the most inspiring moments of the journey. At the top, sat\
  \ an old yak farm and an amazing amount of silence.\n\nFor two hours we sat in total\
  \ silence admiring the amazing landscape and the absolute blissful quiet. This was\
  \ a silence quieter than anything I\u2019d heard before. The mountain breeze came\
  \ only in waves of five or ten seconds, before relinquishing to restore the quiet.\
  \ The aches and pains of the previous days seemed to leave immediately and the air\
  \ breathed a clarity which taught me more than any self-help book, or moment profound\
  \ self-awareness. \n\nFor me, this discovery was the Tibetan appreciation of nothingness;\
  \ a place I can always go back to, where if nothing else brings me a sense of joy,\
  \ there is this momentary peace amidst the chaos of the twenty-first century. In\
  \ the days to follow, the city of Pokhara would solidify my desire to travel back\
  \ and spend a good portion of my life in the peaceful wake of this amazing landscape."
