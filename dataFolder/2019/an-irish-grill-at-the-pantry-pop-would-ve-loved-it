Text: "The moon-faced customs official with the kind blue eyes asked if I had family\
  \ in Ireland. \u201CNah mate.\u201D He smiled, stamped my Aussie passport, \u201C\
  Trust me, Liam Joseph Carroll, you do.\u201D\n\nI know now that I\u2019d misunderstood\
  \ his question. To have family in Ireland is not to have relatives alive this very\
  \ day. It\u2019s to have Gaelic blood coursing your veins, Emerald Isle soil woven\
  \ tight in your DNA. I know this now thanks to a moment in The Pantry at Kilkee,\
  \ a moment that brought me closer to my Pop, Joseph, than I\u2019d been since he\
  \ passed away many years earlier.\n\nKilkee is a small beach town on Ireland\u2019\
  s west coast, in County Clare. My girlfriend, her sister and I were on our way to\
  \ the Cliffs of Moher, getting peckish. We tried a pub first. 10am. Nothing available\
  \ yet but Guinness or tea or to join three old ladies playing cards in the corner.\
  \ \n\nI asked them where a good spot for breakfast was. \u201COh, bless you, a strapping\
  \ young lad with these two fine lassies, best be down to the Pantry. Ask for the\
  \ Little Pantry Grill. Lovely. The best in Ireland.\u201D The other two nodded along,\
  \ \u201CThe best in Ireland. Oh yes.\u201D \n\nI needed clarification, \u201CThe\
  \ pantry? Someone\u2019s pantry?\u201D The leader of the trio whacked me hard in\
  \ the shoulder, \u201CJust walk down yonder laddie. You\u2019ll soon enough understand.\
  \ Remember, the Little Pantry Grill, the best in Ireland.\u201D \n\nAll smiles.\
  \ Off we trotted. \n\nThe Pantry stands like a time capsule, as though the spritely\
  \ grandmother you remember from your childhood is alive and kicking, running a cafeteria\
  \ in the back of her house; the basics of age-old culinary delights done right,\
  \ d\xE9cor done cheap, and blessed with prices low enough to make my penny-pinching\
  \ heart sing. \n\nThe Little Pantry Grill is bacon, sausages, eggs, tomato and beans,\
  \ grilled. It\u2019s sensational. Before tucking in, I thought best go to the bathroom,\
  \ wash my hands. I felt Pop by my shoulder, like way back when, \u201Cgive your\
  \ hands a tub before dinner now, Liam, come on.\u201D\n\nIn the bathroom was the\
  \ replica washbasin I\u2019d only ever seen at Nan and Pop\u2019s; two taps at each\
  \ end, hot and cold, an awkwardly narrow basin, near impossible to fit your hands\
  \ in to. I was overcome with emotion, suddenly filled with a true understanding\
  \ of Pop and the Irish ancestors I\u2019ve never known.\n\nWhen I was five, Pop\
  \ showed me, with much reverence at his Sydney home, how to wash my hands properly\
  \ before dinner, to load the basin up with hot water and fully soap my hands and\
  \ forearms, all the way to the elbows, to really \"give your hands a tub.\" I looked\
  \ at him like he was such a goose. What the hell would you ever need to do that\
  \ for? Just wash the palms, give the fingers a quick scrub. Let\u2019s get rocking\
  \ and rolling and eat some pork chops!\n\nBut there, in Ireland, understanding the\
  \ entrenched history of poverty and starvation, I realised the highlight of Pop\u2019\
  s day, his father\u2019s and grandfather\u2019s and many more before him, after\
  \ toiling in the bitter cold, consumed by manual labour drudgery. Waiting at the\
  \ end of all that misery was the heavenly embrace of a steaming warm washbasin to\
  \ drown your filthy hands and forearms in. \n\nI wiped the tears from my eyes and\
  \ finally washed my hands with the reverence Pop had tried to instil in me all those\
  \ years ago. I used that narrow, dinky basin for all it was worth, enjoying the\
  \ soapy warmth the way nature intended. My hands sparkled all the way to the elbows\
  \ as I went back to devour, just as the ladies had said, the best Little Pantry\
  \ Grill in Ireland, oh yes.  \n\nPop\u2019s long gone from this world but the fact\
  \ he was ever here at all means I\u2019ll always have family in Ireland. I didn\u2019\
  t expect to find his cheeky smile and beautiful soul staring up at me from the most\
  \ unassuming washbasin in The Pantry, Kilkee, County Clare. But, thinking about\
  \ it all now, that\u2019s exactly where I should\u2019ve been expecting to find\
  \ him."
