Text: "The first thing that hits the mind hearing about traveling is \"Yes I need\
  \ to\".\nSmall or big,boy or girl, serviceman or businessman each need a vacation\
  \ and so did I. And the place I chosed was \"Pondicherry\" \nSouthern beauty of\
  \ India is not a hidden trap but it attracted me so much that I didn't seem to wanting\
  \ to return to my hometown.  I was so mesmerized by the beauty of the city and the\
  \ culture their. The most happening part of the story was the night at the a beach\
  \ restaurant. So calming So peaceful So satisfying that I just didn't wanted that\
  \ night to end.  \nPeacefully lying there on stones with breezy winds and stars\
  \ gazing all over. Thinking about life, people, career, relationships and you end\
  \ up meeting a stranger, just like in a fairy tale. Out of no where that person\
  \ came, sat beside and it bonded like this birth was reincarnation only for our\
  \ meeting. More the stranger a person is more deeper you talk about yourself and\
  \ so did we. \nIt was all so delightful and gracious confront for us that hardly\
  \ made us realise that it's dawn time in an hour and of course \"My_Birthday\" which\
  \ was the basic reason for going there. \nAnd soon that conversation ended and we\
  \ left that place reluctantly without realizing that we forgot to exchange name\
  \ and numbers of each other \U0001F604 \nYes! The short span of life spent with\
  \ him was so enduring that it made us forget the basics but there wasn't any regrets\
  \ because the last greeting of our conversation was \"Happy Birthday\" with a hug\
  \ \u2764\nAnd I had a feeling of fulfillness in that moment. \nSo this was my most\
  \ sacred and beautiful travel story. \nI hope to see myself winning this trip!!\
  \  Thanks n love \u2764"
