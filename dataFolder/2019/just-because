Text: "\"Welcome to Havana! Are you traveling just by yourself?\"\n- He asked me when\
  \ I was picking up my passport. I felt misplaced when I answered yes. He directed\
  \ me his glance with a subtle smile and with a peculiar tone of voice, to hide his\
  \ feeling of pity.\n \nMy trip wasn't even started and I already felt awkward for\
  \ been there.\nNo, it was not my first solo trip; but I felt the \"why am I doing\
  \ this? tingling\" since I get down of the plane. The same ones that I felt when\
  \ my family mocked me saying: \"Oh God, please, get a Cuban boyfriend!\"\nI felt\
  \ I had been given a duty. Now, I was already programmed to find my soul mate in\
  \ each place I visited, in every opportunity I had, instead of been surprised for\
  \ my destiny.  For some this is the most logical thing to do when you travel alone,\
  \ get a mate.\n \nArriving at my accommodation, again:\n\"It's just you?\".  -The\
  \ girl who lent me a bedroom, my Airbnb hostess.\nHonestly, I understood why she\
  \ asked me that. I rented a flat for 2 and, well, it's just me showing up. But the\
  \ way she asked bothered me.\nMaybe it was the intriguing and curious tone she used,\
  \ maybe it was the voice of my mom asking me the same thing a couple of weeks before.\n\
  \ \nAfter more chatting, she told me:  \"Traveling alone in Cuba can be dangerous\
  \ for a woman.\" - Ok, maybe now everything starts to make sense.\nI left the flat\
  \ thinking about what just happened.\nCould it be that everything is in my mind?\
  \ Or maybe, the load of being a girl in a not so \"girl friendly Word\" teases me?\n\
  I know that every tourist should be careful when traveling alone to another country.\
  \ Doesn't matter if is he or she; but in some way, it feels arduous when you are\
  \ a solo girl.\n \nNow you might be telling yourself: \"Ok. You're a girl traveling\
  \ alone and everyone told you how dangerous was and what to do. So?\"\nAnd that\
  \ \"so\", that annoying \"so\" marked the rest of my plans. Because from that point,\
  \ I started to choose my activities thinking: Would I be safe? Would I found love\
  \ over there? Is that tour just for one? How late is late at night?\nInstead of\
  \ enjoying my trip I started to be afraid, to question, to overthink...\n \nUntil\
  \ I met Meiby. Oh Meiby, God bless Meiby!\nEverything changed when I mustered her.\n\
  \"Laura? Hi, I'm Meiby. It's so cool that you're traveling alone, what a blast!\"\
  \  -I organized this trip with the goal of visiting places where my expectations\
  \ could be fulfilled. Meiby was the right girl.\nShe was our guide to get into Havana's\
  \ nightlife. I booked into a party of 8, only 2 of us made it.\nMike, the other\
  \ tourist, was 54 years old. He only stayed until 11pm. By midnight it was just\
  \ Meiby and me. Awesome.\n \nMeiby was just like me: a free fulfilled woman who\
  \ wants to live, who looks for new experience, wants to be surprised and enjoy life,\
  \ just because.\nI was in a typical hangout with a bestie, my Cuban best friend.\n\
  With her, I forgot I was in another country, about my duty of looking for Mr. Right,\
  \ and how dangerous Cuba was for a girl.\n \n\"I wish more girl got the spirit like\
  \ yours and travel alone.\"\nWe keep talking about my new plans on Havana for the\
  \ next 4 days. Suddenly she told me: \"Actually, you reminded me about a Cuban urban\
  \ song that talks about this girl who doesn't give explanations to no one and has\
  \ nobody tell her what to do. She just does the things that she likes, fearless,\
  \ like you.\" I smiled.\n \nExpectations. We seek them when we plan a trip. Expectations\
  \ made us had the typical itinerary full of clich\xE9s and the same \"to do list\"\
  \ to check. Wouldn't be marvelous if we just travel to surprise us?\nWouldn't be\
  \ astonishing if we travel for the \"because\"?\n \nNow, I'm a \"just because\"\
  \ traveler girl."
