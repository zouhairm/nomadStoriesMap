Text: "It was the Fall of 2011.  I wanted to celebrate my 40th birthday in a memorable\
  \ way.  I knew instinctively that it had to be New York City.  I discovered that\
  \ Andrea Bocelli was performing a benefit concert for PBS in Central Park.  I got\
  \ so excited for the chance to see this world-famous tenor, and the free ticket\
  \ would fit my budget perfectly.  Even though this was a complimentary concert,\
  \ I still had to obtain a golden ticket.  Like the Willy Wonka movie, I was willing\
  \ to eat thousands of chocolate bars.  \n     I immediately went to the reservations\
  \ website, but missed this opportunity by way more than a New York minute.  Although\
  \ I did not currently possess a coveted concert pass, there was certainly no reason\
  \ to give up trying.  On the evening of the show, I walked to Central Park and cemented\
  \ myself outside of the entrance venue.  Unfortunately, no one had an extra ticket\
  \ and my heart was sinking deeper than Bocelli\u2019s vocal range.  \n     As the\
  \ concert began, I heard Mr. Bocelli greet the massive audience and start to belt\
  \ out his Italian bravado. At that moment, I decided that I would no longer be the\
  \ person on the outside looking in, but rather, get into the game.  It became a\
  \ powerful catalyst for future change in my life.  My husband was aware of the agony\
  \ that I felt, as I had expressed that to him on many occasions.  \n     Fast forward\
  \ to February 14th, 2019.  Hubby slipped an envelope to me and insisted that I open\
  \ it immediately.  As I opened the Valentines Day card, out fell 2 tickets for the\
  \ Andrea Bocelli concert happening that evening in Miami.  There I was holding passes\
  \ to the most anticipated concert in South Florida.  However, the sting of those\
  \ exclusionary feelings from so many years ago came rushing back. \n    My excitement\
  \ was mounting as we drew closer to the venue.  Suddenly, our GPS added 45 minutes\
  \ onto our arrival time.  There was an accident and we were about to be late for\
  \ the most important validation concert of my life.\n     Our next barrier was to\
  \ find non-existent parking. When traffic came to a complete standstill, I could\
  \ see the arena in the distance. In pure desperation, I snatched one of the tickets,\
  \ kissed my husband, jumped out of his truck, and told him I\u2019d meet him there.\
  \  I literally began to run down the side streets of Miami.  When my stilettos began\
  \ to fail me, I whisked them off and continued barefoot.  I was confronted with\
  \ the promise that I made to myself so long ago and I wasn\u2019t willing to sideline\
  \ again.  \n     I sailed through security, and my mission was to find my seat located\
  \ in the 3rd balcony. Since there were long lines for the escalator, I took the\
  \ back stairs.  Maneuvering through the massive crowd was a tremendous challenge.\
  \  While approaching the second floor, I heard the announcer welcome everyone and\
  \ introduce the orchestra.  Security was screaming at me to slow down, but I couldn\u2019\
  t.  As I arrived at my section, I pushed my ticket into the usher\u2019s face and\
  \ frantically asked, \u201CWhere am I sitting?\u201D  He pointed at 2 empty seats\
  \ in the middle of the row.  I accidentally stepped onto everyone\u2019s toes while\
  \ trying to find my throne.  Just as I sat down, the orchestra was harmonizing to\
  \ B flat.  I made it in just the nick of time and began to sob uncontrollably. \n\
  \     My husband finally arrived into Bocelli\u2019s second song.  He looked frazzled\
  \ from his fight with Miami traffic.  We both eventually calmed down as the result\
  \ of the melodic music.  His singing was a lullaby that miraculously melted the\
  \ stress away.  It was hard for me to believe that I finally got into the game and\
  \ was no longer looking in from the outside.  \n     For his final song, Bocelli\
  \ sang, \u201CTime to Say Goodbye.\u201D  Coincidentally, I also said good-bye that\
  \ evening to those feelings of being excluded.  Thank you, Mr. Bocelli, for the\
  \ realization that I possess a powerful literary gift to pen this tale, and the\
  \ opportunity to leave a writing legacy for many to enjoy in the future."
