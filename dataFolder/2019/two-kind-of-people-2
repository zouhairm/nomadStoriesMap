Text: "It\u2019s been two days since I\u2019m back from France. I keep complaining\
  \ all day going back and forth from bed to the sofa. Mr Pexy has enough of it. He\
  \ thinks I\u2019m crazy.\n<< You only should have been in France, then you could\
  \ get why I keep complaining like this>>, he meows to reply to me. I look at the\
  \ animal thinking that I\u2019m sad cause I did not bring him with me. I want to\
  \ remedy at this error. << I tell you now everything I experienced there!>>. I pick\
  \ him up and I start petting him. << I know you would hear about Paris Mr Pexy but\
  \ let me say that I appreciated Bordeaux so much more! It\u2019s a magic city, every\
  \ spot has his own reason to exist and each street has nice stories to tell you.\
  \ \nIt might happen that while you are focused on admiring the lights that shine\
  \ close to the Garonne, you just turn back getting shock from the beauty of the\
  \ Place de la bourse. \nJust walk around the corner and look to the left side! No\
  \ darling, you are not in Paris, but you are in front of the Saint\u2019andr\xE8\
  \u2019s Cathedral. You got tired now, did\u2019t you? But hold on a bit more so\
  \ you can get the Grosse Cloche. It\u2019s a tower with a huge bell. You would have\
  \ so much fun ringing it. \n\nDo you want to know now which kind of people you can\
  \ find there?>> My cat has closed his eyes from a while, maybe he\u2019s trying\
  \ to imagine that wonderful city. << In Bordeaux there are two kind of people only:\
  \ the ones that walk looking up \u2013 seeing the monuments - and the ones that\
  \ look at the ground. It\u2019s obvious that the first ones are tourists \u2013\
  \ cameras and maps suggest it to you. The second ones are locals. They walk fast\
  \ starring the phone and they are focused on their own thoughts only. They grew\
  \ up surrounded from the beauty, but they don\u2019t appreciate it. \nThere\u2019\
  s fortunately a small amount of them that recognize what\u2019s the art, but not\
  \ because of this we can call them artist. \nDo you know what? I talked with one\
  \ of them, his name is Clem\xE9nt Beuselink. He draws Bordeaux c\u2019est gave bien\
  \ on corks, which somehow means \u201CBordeaux is damnit beautiful\u201D. Moreover,\
  \ he told me about Anthony Gornely that build Les hommes de bronze. Those are big\
  \ statues placed in front of the entrance of monuments to draw people\u2019s attention.\
  \ I laugh so bad when he said this to me. How can you not notice huge monuments\
  \ like them, Mr Pexy!?\nI asked him the reason why Anthony built them and laughing\
  \ he said to me \u201Che didn\u2019t do it for tourists but for locals. They have\
  \ always lived here but they forgot how beautiful Bordeaux is\u201D>>.\n\nI pet\
  \ my cat for one more last time before he goes out complaining. I smile saying <<\
  \ I told you about it!>>"
