Text: "Tottori - the place where you 'catch birds', if we trust the meaning of its\
  \ Japanese name. I did not pay much attention to birds though. What I found instead,\
  \ were sand dunes, wild irises, really tasty food, a ladies' club, curls and a generous\
  \ bookseller - all these within 24h.\n\nIn 18 days we had visited 11 cities on the\
  \ Honshu island and Tottori was the least known to us. Only Japanese, South-Korean\
  \ and Chinese tourists come to visit this place, us being the only Westerners in\
  \ the region. My Brazilian friend Marisa Nakamura, with whom I was travelling, was\
  \ seeking for her roots, since her 90 year old grandmother was born here.\n\nTottori\
  \ has about 197,000 inhabitants and is a seaside city in the northwest of Japan,\
  \ 674 km away from Tokyo, the capital. The locals are comparatively unconcerned\
  \ and for the first time we saw overweight Japanese, which was a relief to us, since\
  \ we are women and still love to eat.\n\n4pm. We enter a bookstore and meet the\
  \ first person who speaks English since we arrived. Marisa is looking for a book\
  \ in Japanese for her grandmother and asks for a title by Kawabata Yasunari, who\
  \ was the first Japanese writer to win the Nobel Prize for Literature back in 1964.\
  \ The bookseller asks curiously, why my friend would have such an interest in that\
  \ specific author and she lets him know the story of her family emigrating to Brazil\
  \ in the 1920s. He nods but unfortunately he doesn\u2019t have the book at hand\
  \ and asks us to come back at 2pm the next day. We thank him and agree on stopping\
  \ by the next day. \n\n5pm. We are walking uphill on a hidden path, we discovered\
  \ after having visited the ruins of the central castle. The hike is quite difficult\
  \ but all worth it. Once we reach the top, we see a garden of wild irises and behind\
  \ it, the sun is setting over the city with the dunes and seashore visible in the\
  \ background. A perfect moment!\n\n8pm. Back to the center, we are trying to find\
  \ a restaurant. A spicy smell catches my attention and I sniff around like a street\
  \ dog until we reach a traditional, dirty Japanese canteen, which is unusual in\
  \ tidy Japan. The menu is written all over the wall - in Japanese. We observe what\
  \ the other guests chose and just point with our fingers at different foods when\
  \ the owner takes our order. And there it comes! A mix of eggs, vegetables and bacon\
  \ which we steer and fry on a hot plate in front of us. Oishii (delicious)! \u201C\
  Okonomiyaki\u201D, we say. \u201CVery good!\u201D is the only English the owner\
  \ knows. It means \u201Ceverything you want\u201D, which indicates that traditionally\
  \ one uses leftovers of vegetables and meat to prepare it. \n\n10pm. When leaving,\
  \ we see an entertainment house on the other side of the street, specialized on\
  \ a female clientele, showing young men on their outdoors. \u201COho! This is unusual!\
  \ Let\u2019s check it out!\u201D Marisa and I go to the door and are already keen\
  \ to give it a try but our lack of Japanese makes it difficult for us to figure\
  \ out the rules and the pricing. We giggle and leave. \n\n3pm the next day. We finally\
  \ arrived at the bookstore and feel ashamed for being late. The bookseller just\
  \ smiles. \u201CGood, that you came back! I got your book!\u201D He grabs into his\
  \ brown leather bag and takes out a third edition copy of Yukiguni  (Snow Country).\
  \ When Marisa asks how much she would owe him, the seller just answers: \u201CThis\
  \ is a present for your grandmother.\u201D We feel very grateful but also a bit\
  \ uncomfortable, since this one came from his private bookshelf. Marisa writes down\
  \ his address and promises to send him a Brazilian novel translated to English in\
  \ return. \n\nWhat an incredible place, where people have curly hair, speak no English,\
  \ happily gain some extra pounds and help others in incredibly unusual ways. Thank\
  \ you, Tottori! I shall see you again!"
