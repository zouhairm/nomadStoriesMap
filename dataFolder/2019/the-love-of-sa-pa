Text: "The first time I set foot into a place called Vietnam, exactly Sa Pa, the feel\
  \ that recorded in my mind is the aroma of the species, the aroma is exactly the\
  \ same aroma of my mother's cooking, a traditional Chinese pork stew, funny thing\
  \ i travel far from home, but this place reminds me of my own home. The warmth of\
  \ the Sa Pa peoples greets me is one of the best things. This city is small but\
  \ holds a lot of magnificence landscape, the mountains surrounded this city, fresh\
  \ air, and the colorful traditional clothing which most of the women wear it makes\
  \ this journey more exciting.\nFirst wandering in Sa Pa city starts with meet the\
  \ guide for mountain trekking randomly in the city hall, this is a common way. A\
  \ lot of locals with a traditional cloth will approach and offering their guide\
  \ service for mountain trekking with a very affordable price if you agree to use\
  \ their service, they will give you a woven bracelet and set the time to meet again\
  \ in city hall to start trekking. \nMeet The Local.\nI met Zis, a local guide with\
  \ a minim English skill but still understandable. Zis and I start trekking the mountain,\
  \ which is the place that she and her family live, start going through a traditional\
  \ market place which sells a variety of meat include horse meat and then continue\
  \ to an uphill footpath entering expanse of trees and weeds. \nThe first hour of\
  \ the trekking my eyes treated to see a joyful view of rice field and greet by the\
  \ warmness of the local who is in the busy time doing daily work in a rice field.\
  \ \nSee The Culture\nWhile we taking a break from the walking, Zis explain to me\
  \ about their culture in Sa Pa. She said to me that girls in Sa Pa just allowed\
  \ to cut their hair twice in their lives. They used to grow their hair so long and\
  \ twist it around their head, I see it just like a Frida Khalo hairstyle. It's their\
  \ culture women always have long hair to be a pretty one. I saw Zis long hair, it\
  \ almost touches her knee!  Zis have a metal little comb made by brass, she told\
  \ me that her father made it by himself. A brass comb and woven are the most popular\
  \ craft from Sa Pa, they use to make it handmade. Men make the metal craft and the\
  \ women make a woven colorful cloth (they love to use bright red, blue, or green)\
  \ or an indigo cloth. \nOn my way to the top of the mountain, we passed children\
  \ play in the edge of a steep mountain, livestock running around that owns by the\
  \ local, but the most interesting part of this trekking is in the top of the mountain,\
  \ we found a big square of a marijuana field. This is the first time I see it in\
  \ my own eyes, I just feel like I'm in a set of Narcos series!. But Zis explain\
  \ to me that marijuana is a common basic material that they use to make a textile,\
  \ they make their own cloth and dye the cloth naturally with indigo color that they\
  \ found from plants. It explains why while in this trekking I found a lot of barrels\
  \ of indigo liquid. Zis told me that Sa Pa peoples used to sell the cloth and other\
  \ craft in Ba Cha market, that always held on Sunday morning, not so far from Sa\
  \ Pa area or they sell directly to the tourist. \nEnd of Journey\nFinally, arrive\
  \ in Zis home. She offers me tea while we catch our breath from six hours of trekking.\
  \ It is really a simple home, made by a thin wood and the floor is directly the\
  \ soil. She lives in her husband family in one house, and they are so kind as to\
  \ teach me how to woven and cook a simple local noodle. The beautiful view of the\
  \ mountain landscape, a warm noodle, and laugh of Zis family make me always wanna\
  \ go back there, to the small city of Sa Pa."
