Text: "I had gone to Amsterdam for a job interview at a contemporary art organzine\
  \ and ended up fishing with local fishermen in Seychelles. Rolling out of bed I\
  \ made my way to the bathroom before the other girls woke. Brushing my teeth and\
  \ washing my face my main focus for the day was protecting myself from sunburn.\
  \ After bathing in sunscreen I made my way to the kitchen. While cleaning the Moka\
  \ pot my boss and the girls grunted their good mornings. Sinking into their chairs\
  \ at the kitchen table I realized there wasn't a morning person in sight. Right\
  \ before the sun rises is my favorite part of the day, the crisp air and halo lighting\
  \ gives off this enchanting feeling of serenity well the rest of the world sleeps.\
  \ We arrived fifteen minutes early giving us just enough time for photos catching\
  \ the sun kiss the horizon. Jean-Francois, Curtis, and Walter arrived right on time.\
  \ Waving from the boat they pulled onto shore in their motorboat before taking us\
  \ out to the fishing boat that was anchored. Once on the fishing boat, the guys\
  \ started to clean and prepare breakfast while Curtis, the captain, started to bring\
  \ us out to sea. I've always enjoyed the open waters. Breathing in the salt water\
  \ breeze I soaked up the morning rays while basking at the moment. These are the\
  \ memories I live for, the solitary moments of adventure where I know only a few\
  \ have had the chance at this experience. Finishing up our canned chicken on white\
  \ bread and tea we had been sailing about an hour before Curtis stops at our first\
  \ fishing spot. With three girls and three fishermen, we break off into teams so\
  \ the guys can show us how to set up our line.  \n\nThey fish with one long line\
  \ that has five hooks tied onto it with a weight at the end, they drop the weight\
  \ until it hits the ground, where the fish stay by the coral and then wait until\
  \ they feel a pull before bringing up the line. Having only ever fished with a pole\
  \ I was excited about this experience. Though having soft baby hands I was worried\
  \ about what the weight of the line would do. Even after having them taped it was\
  \ a risk that the line would cut my fingers and create small calluses that were\
  \ an easy fix compared to the calluses the guys had built up over time. \n\n\nIsolated\
  \ from the group in the back of the boat, Curtis was teaching me how the monitors\
  \ tracked the fish and how to stir the boat to those coordinates. In between fishing\
  \ spots I asked Curtin what they normally talked about while out on the sea. He\
  \ told me that on good days they didn't do much talking because they raced from\
  \ spot to spot trying to catch as much fish as they could. But on days when it was\
  \ slow, they talked about everyday life, the drama, love, and just joking around.\
  \  \n \nWatching Curtis fish was an intriguing experience, checking the monitors\
  \ he makes sure the fish are around the bout before yelling to the guys to drop\
  \ in their lines. When the line has finally stopped running through his hands Curtis\
  \ quickly reels in a little and then he waits.  He looks off into the distance as\
  \ he raises his hand making sure that he will feel the weight of the pull once the\
  \ fish takes the bait. Once there is a bite Curtis pulls the line up as quickly\
  \ as he can then dropping it back down again to see if he can catch a fish for every\
  \ hook. The speed at which Curtis pulls the line seems inhuman to me, though I could\
  \ understand how you'd build the skill and muscle after years of practice. \n\n\
  Surprisingly my favorite part of fishing is actually taking the fish off the hook,\
  \ though as an animal lover I hate to kill them the experience of being with locals\
  \ catching your own food, see all the different beautiful fish, and being able to\
  \ sail the boat home made me extremely grateful for the experience."
