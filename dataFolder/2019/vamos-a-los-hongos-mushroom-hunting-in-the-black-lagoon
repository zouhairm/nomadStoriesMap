Text: "\"Vamos a los hongos?\", Jos\xE9 asked. \nWe were sitting in a bush camp not\
  \ far from la Playa Grande in Punta Del Diablo, Uruguay. Jos\xE9, our guide in this\
  \ psychedelically motivated adventure, finished eating a campfire roasted quarter-chicken\
  \ and placed his leftover onions and potatoes in the same type of blue torn plastic\
  \ bag he used to store his Paraguayan Marijuana.\n\"Si?\", he said while placing\
  \ the bag underneath a log next to dying campfire. Jos\xE9\u2019s camp was transient\
  \ at its core, rigs for laundry, hanging pots and pans, various empty plastics,\
  \ and a beer bottle filled with guava juice.\n\nOur group, consisting of my girlfriend,\
  \ a German born carpenter named Nick, and I all answered \u201CYes\u201D at the\
  \ same time.  A solution of excitement and apprehension hid in our answer as we\
  \ all stood up to leave.  That day, in the calm of the afternoon sun, we would hunt\
  \ for mushrooms at the Black Lagoon.\n\nThe day before, Jos\xE9 emerged out of the\
  \ woods randomly walking towards my girlfriend and I as we headed to the beach.\
  \ We thought was just another foot-path drive-by but moments later he was showing\
  \ us large nuggets of pressed Paraguayan weed, organic, seeds and stems included.\
  \  It was not what we were looking for.\n\nDays earlier Duolingo taught me what\
  \ I needed to know.\n\u201CHongos?\u201D I said.\nJos\xE9 replied with the characteristic\
  \ Uruguayan, \u201CSiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\u201D.\nSpanish speakers in Uruguay have a\
  \ dense and layered manner of saying \u201CSi\u201D. It starts low and travels upward\
  \ before finishing at a pitch of absolute certainty. It means \u201Cyes\u201D, \u201C\
  absolutely\u201D, \u201Cwhy not?\u201D, and \"of course\"; all at the same time.\n\
  \nWith that one \u201CSiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\u201D we knew magic mushrooms were in our\
  \ future. Jos\xE9 told us to come back the next day. That evening the Atlantic pushed\
  \ in a strong storm, then the morning blessed us with a strict regimen of sunshine.\
  \ Ideal mushroom growing conditions. \n\nEight hours after that midnight rain Jos\xE9\
  \ had us in front of an Earth-ship (well worth a Google). A man with a hollow brown\
  \ set of teeth greeted us and Jos\xE9 began to talk in rapid Spanish. Then the teeth\
  \ told us exactly where to go: La Laguna Negara (The Black Lagoon).\n\nThe reason\
  \ being the creature of Punta Del Diablo\u2019s Black Lagoon; the cow. Cow paddies\
  \ are perfect incubators for mushrooms; like quartz to gold and where there is one\
  \ there is the other, and cows roam free around the Black Lagoon in spades.  Jos\xE9\
  \ then led us to Highway 9, where we fished for a ride to the Lagoon with our thumbs.\
  \ \n\nWhere hitchhiking is common, such as in Uruguay, it is not seen as a potentially\
  \ life threatening endeavour, but a good idea and a good deal. All the horror stories\
  \ and urban legends holding many of us negatively influenced travellers back have\
  \ yet to reach this place. Hitchhiking is a courteous and simple transaction that\
  \ can be a wondrous way to see a country like Uruguay. But with anything, don\u2019\
  t be an idiot and exercise caution.  With a little generosity and faith hitchhiking\
  \ can get us all to the place we need to be. \n\nOur ride dropped us off at a road\
  \ leading off Highway 9 towards the Black Lagoon. Flanked by hills and creeks pot\
  \ marked by hoove-shaped holes left by the dozens of large wild cows. Trees and\
  \ underbrush leaning lazily courtesy of the salt tainted wind from the nearby salty\
  \ lagoon. Cow paddies were everywhere.  Jos\xE9 gave each a quadrant to search,\
  \ divide and conquer. We began to work.\n\nOne out of every seven mushrooms found\
  \ was the right stuff, with only 30 minutes of searching we each had at least five\
  \ grams of psychedelic mushrooms. The rest of our time at that Black Lagoon was\
  \ spent watching the sunset, which is the main reason why tourists and locals visit\
  \ the Lagoon.\n\nYou have all seen a sunset, I need not describe, but the sunset\
  \ over the Black Lagoon that evening was particularly awesome. The lagoon\u2019\
  s huge mass of black water mirrored a vast array of colours I swear I have never\
  \ seen before, or maybe it was just the mushrooms?"
