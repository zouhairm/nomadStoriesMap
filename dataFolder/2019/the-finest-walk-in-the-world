Text: "It\u2019s day three of our four day hike through the Milford Track, appropriately\
  \ named the \u201Cfinest walk in the world\u201D. The track, at intermediate level,\
  \ is located in the Fiordland National Park in the South Island of New Zealand.\
  \ It stretches 53.5 kilometers and at its peak reaches 1154 meters above sea level.\
  \ The track winds through valleys carved out by glaciers, rainforests thick with\
  \ native wildlife, and cascading waterfalls that make you feel as though Avatar\
  \ is real and you\u2019re living in it.\n\nStanding at the bottom of the Mackinnon\
  \ Pass, the climb ahead seems overwhelming. The track is narrow, ascending at cruel\
  \ angles. There are boulders that can only be climbed over, and precarious looking\
  \ sections threatening slips. About two thirds of the way up, the mountain disappears\
  \ amid the low-hanging cloud. A steady drizzle has impeded my vision and I wish\
  \ I had windscreen wipers for my glasses. My pack - weighing 11.5 kilograms - tugs\
  \ heavily on my back and my shoulders are expressing their discontent more and more\
  \ loudly with every minute. However the pain in my shoulders is a welcome distraction\
  \ from the equally uncomfortable pain in my lower back.\n\nThe track is well kept.\
  \ The Department of Conservation rangers from all three huts are responsible for\
  \ maintaining the track either side of their location. Sections of the track that\
  \ run through waterfalls and along cliff faces were forewarned as being more challenging.\n\
  \nAs our group of ten begin our ascent, I feel the air getting thinner. I breathe\
  \ deeply; the cool damp air stings my lungs with its chill, and tastes of rich soil\
  \ and moss. \n\nWe walk in silence, in single file. Although we don\u2019t speak,\
  \ it\u2019s never quiet. The surrounding bush is alive with native birds - Tomtits\
  \ the size of golfballs, Black Robins who come and sit on your hiking boot if you\
  \ stop for a minute, and Kea who hang around threatening to pick apart your pack\
  \ if you leave it unattended. Their chatter and the crunch of gravel beneath our\
  \ boots punctuates the sound of a thousand waterfalls.\n\nPulling myself up the\
  \ near vertical incline by tree roots and rocks, I\u2019m reminded of exactly how\
  \ unfit I am. However, looking out as the view gets more and more sprawling, I\u2019\
  m stunned by the beauty of this country. So perfect and still. So remarkably untouched.\
  \ \nI\u2019m at the back of the group - being the most out of shape - and my mother\
  \ in law is kind by staying back with me.  We don\u2019t talk, but her presence\
  \ is appreciated. My thighs are screaming in protest from the climb. My lungs are\
  \ burning and my cheeks are on fire. \n\nThe mountain feels alive beneath my feet,\
  \ as though she has been gracious enough to share her beauty with us. With each\
  \ tug of a tree root and each foothold found in a crevice, it feels as though we\u2019\
  re connected and she\u2019s guiding me up.\n\nWe pause every hundred meters or so\
  \ to have a drink of water from our bottles, filled with water from the streams\
  \ we pass along the way. It\u2019s the freshest, cleanest, most delicious water\
  \ I\u2019ve ever tasted. As we drink, we take in the surroundings and I\u2019m again\
  \ blown away. \n\nAt the top of the pass there\u2019s a bone-chilling wind and rain\
  \ blowing horizontally, however I\u2019m met with a 360 degree view of paradise.\
  \ Rolling mountains thick with fifty shades of green. The valley that we\u2019ve\
  \ spent the last two and a half days walking through stretches vastly, peppered\
  \ with low-hanging cloud and high, thin waterfalls that appear to fall from heaven.\
  \ Kea swoop and soar through the sky, full coloured feathers on display and for\
  \ a moment I forget that they pose a very real threat to the lunch I\u2019m eating,\
  \ and my pack sitting beside me.\n\nThere\u2019s a toilet at the top. Someone has\
  \ thoughtfully built a window in the door so as you sit and do your business, you\
  \ can gaze upon the valley below. \n\nWe refill our bottles, pack away our lunch\
  \ and make our way towards the track to continue the last day and a half on the\
  \ finest walk in the world."
