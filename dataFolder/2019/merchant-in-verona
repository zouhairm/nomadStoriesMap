Text: "Staring into the deep abyss of possible locations to head towards, the struggle\
  \ to transgress that into a booked option seemed unthinkable. Yet three weeks later\
  \ (and a weekend off from college); I\u2019m clutching my flight ticket and sighing\
  \ as my water bottle falls and splits on the airport floor, in my mind setting an\
  \ overall precedent for the week. \n\nThe other end isn\u2019t much better, thrashing\
  \ with rain, but I change my focus. I find beauty in the sculptures I stop to gawk\
  \ at. The view of the city by the river is kind blowing and golden hour illuminated\
  \ the architecture like some kind of extortionate photo technique. The lapping of\
  \ the waves interacting with the harsh rock beneath it echoes in my ears like a\
  \ beating drum coaxing me into continuing. \n\nThat\u2019s the thing, my first trip\
  \ had this expectation of impossible perfection I had ascribed to it. Once I settled\
  \ and chose to navigate around and in spite of the myriad of complexities, such\
  \ as weather and the seeming lack of vegan options, the trip suddenly became spun\
  \ with a more detailed and exciting web. The Roman arches soak up the rain like\
  \ deep sponges of history; the issues of food becomes a thrill to seek a solution\
  \ too (a delightful cafe caked Zazie being this dear solution). \n\nJust as I\u2019\
  m leaving, Verona lashes me one last bone for me to sink my teeth into, keeping\
  \ me eager to travel and get to explore this flavourful culture again. The sun is\
  \ dripping through the park near to my train station and painting the trees and\
  \ this mammoth like intricate sculpture, a swan song emblematic of my overall outtake\
  \ of the trip. \n\nThe merchant in Verona who succeeded was the man who navigated\
  \ the difficulties of the sea and kissed the waves whilst he tangled with them.\
  \ Not the man staring blankly from the shore inside the confinements of a concrete\
  \ box wishing he was instead out there battling with the elements firsthand."
