Text: "Repetition, repetition and repetition.\nMy first few weeks in this new cage\
  \ which smells like ocean and sea food, is all about repetition. It took almost\
  \ 24 days to learn that it is not \u201Cestoy turca\u201D but more like \u201Csoy\
  \ turca\u201D. I know that \u201Csoy\u201D is for the things that you cannot change\
  \ from birth. Everything is about repeating whatever they say. If you go to market\
  \ at 2 p.m, you won\u2019t have your leche because it is siesta. If you repeat the\
  \ same mistake for 16 days, you will learn to eat your dinner at 10 p.m, not at\
  \ 6 p.m. If you are brave enough to come back home from fiesta before midnight,\
  \ you will miss your chance to see that it is not a real kebab over and over again.\n\
  Quiero una estrella, por favor.\nThis new cage does not wear fez, but it wears a\
  \ lot of stuff in carnivals. It does not drink Turkish coffee, but it has coffee\
  \ machines for cafe con leche. I imitate whatever they do. I watch football on Sundays\
  \ and shout \u201Cvamos\u201D for Deportivo. I tell people that this is how we do\
  \ in Galicia. This is how we are from two years. Just like them, now I check translator\
  \ when I have to say Hungr\xEDa in Turco. \nOne of my friends suggested me to get\
  \ a budgerigar. When I teach him Turco, I will be able to speak my language. \n\
  Quiero periquito, por favor.\nRepetition, repetition and repetition. I see myself\
  \ being a teacher in one of those language courses. I named the budgerigar \u201C\
  \u0130zmir\u201D. I said \u0130zmir a few thousand times for it to imitate finally.\
  \ When I learnt how to do paella, \u0130zmir learnt to say my name. When I knew\
  \ a few \u201Cjoder, jodete\u201D, \u0130zmir knew how to play with a small ball.\
  \ When I knew every single tapas bar in A Coru\xF1a, \u0130zmir knew every single\
  \ room in my casa.\nWhen I knew \u0130zmir was becoming me, \u0130zmir knew I was\
  \ Galicia. \nQuiero ir, por favor.\nI feel it is more like \u201Cestoy turca\u201D\
  \ now."
