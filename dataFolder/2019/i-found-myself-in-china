Text: "My life got messed up last year, so I decided to go to China. The conditions\
  \ were pretty good. I was supposed to work for half a year, but I spent there for\
  \ only two months. This time was the most challenging in my life but also the most\
  \ meaningful. \nWhen I came to China, the agency told me that I have to work with\
  \ a travel visa for a month, then extend it for one more month, then go to Hong\
  \ Kong and so on. But everything went wrong. My permit was extended for eight days,\
  \ and I was able to take it only on the fourth. There were no train tickets to Shenzhen\
  \ (the city bordering Hong Kong to the south) before the last day of my visa. The\
  \ road took me 9 hours and a half. When I arrived in Hong Kong's border, they didn't\
  \ let me in. They kept me at the immigration police station for two hours and interrogated\
  \ me without any reason. I was nervous and cold. The police officer on the crossing\
  \ point told me to try to go to Macau, so I went there next morning. I came to Zhuhai\
  \ by train, this where the crossing point to Macau is. This time China didn't let\
  \ me out, because my visa was expired. The officer on the border told me to go back\
  \ to the city I was living in and extend my visa one more time than leave the country.\n\
  There are no straight trains from Zhuhai to Luoyang, the city I worked in, so I\
  \ had to go to Guangzhou at first. But there weren't any trains from Guangzhou that\
  \ day, and I had to wait till morning. The fastest train was a 17-hours one, with\
  \ NO SEAT. But the good thing is that the Chinese are very foreign-friendly and\
  \ they let me sit on their seats. At the public security bureau, I was told that\
  \ I should go back to Ukraine in ten days or I will have to pay the fine. So I bought\
  \ the nearest tickets and went back home. But there is another part of the story.\
  \ \nThe first day I came to Luoyang I went out to buy some water in the evening.\
  \ When I was going back home, a tall Chinese guy came along and talked to me in\
  \ Chinese. I knew one phrase from his speech that I had learned on my way to China.\
  \ It was \"listen to a song\". I was answering him in English, that I'm tired, I'm\
  \ going home, but he didn't understand. He kept on inviting me to his pub. So I\
  \ said \"fine\" and went in. I was wrapped in a cloud of cigarette smoke. There\
  \ were lots of people inside, and everyone wanted me to sit with them and treat\
  \ me. Nobody could speak English, so we added each other on Wechat and talked by\
  \ using instant translation. There also was a boy playing the guitar. Somebody asked\
  \ me if I could sing and I said that I could, just a little. So the next moment\
  \ I was sitting on the stage playing my song. \nThe next evening, I came back again,\
  \ and that guy was playing random chords, and I was singing the poems I had written.\
  \ We decided to create a band together. I came there every night, and we sang songs\
  \ along. He didn't speak any English, but we could understand each other. Then he\
  \ introduced me to a friend of him, and her English was perfect, so she helped us\
  \ to communicate. She also helped me a lot with other things. She is my best friend\
  \ now, and so is he.\nI didn't expect to find real friendship in China. I also didn't\
  \ expect to find myself in learning Chinese. I wanted to communicate with them,\
  \ so I started learning. Now, after half a year we are sitting at the pub we first\
  \ met, and I feel like I\u2019ve never left this place, everything has remained\
  \ the same. The only difference is that I'm talking to them in Chinese, and I feel\
  \ like I belong here."
