Text: "When the opportunity to take this trip came to me, I thought: \"Ok, a little\
  \ town near Edinburgh will be interesting\". I just expected to visit Edinburgh,\
  \ take pictures on the city and maybe taste a Scotch. \nWhen we arrived, the weather\
  \ was awful. I had to wait until my partner finish some buisness in this city, so\
  \ I had two free days to walk through the Glasgow rain alone. Instead, I took the\
  \ city tour to not get a cold. \nSuch a surprise! The victorian sytilish buildings\
  \ were there for me to be inmortalized in my memory and in my cellphone camera.\
  \ The second and not the last surprise, it is not a little town, actually is the\
  \ biggest city in Scotland. The history is is printed in every building or construction,\
  \ sometimes with global history events, sometimes with scary ghost stories. But\
  \ it was not only old buildings, also there are awesome architectures, such as the\
  \ new bridge, the weather tower and the concert hall named for the neighborhood.\
  \ A particular and beautiful detail around the city is the street art, that gives\
  \ the colorful touch to a gray landscape. \nThe third surprise it was a really funny\
  \ touch: A statue with a traffic cone in its head! The Wellington statue is iconic\
  \ in the city, I also bought a magnet with its picture! It is not only funny, actually\
  \ is also the representation of the neighborhood mood. \nSo, a beautiful city, full\
  \ of culture and story, that has nothing to envy to Edinburgh."
