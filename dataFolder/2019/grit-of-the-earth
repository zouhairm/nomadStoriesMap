Text: "My young hands feel the arthritic cramping of elders, or those whose iron grip\
  \ encircle pickaxes. As I work, my mind occupies both past and present. I try to\
  \ envision how the ancient sunrise must have looked when buildings were whole and\
  \ smoke rose, born from the bellows of metalworking shops. I feel Mother Gaea\u2019\
  s heat, roiling within the layers separating us from her smoldering heart. Here,\
  \ I am connected. My calloused fingers graze sherds, each different in size, shape,\
  \ and ornamentation, yet each add clarity to a piecemeal story. Here, I am content,\
  \ uncovering mysteries from humanity\u2019s past, hoping they may give insights\
  \ to the future in exchange for their liberation. \n\tEvery chip, scratch, sliver\
  \ of paint, each subtle change in the composition of soil, every rock, they all\
  \ have their place. Yet oftentimes, the most wonderful discoveries are in the shambles\
  \ fondly referred to as \u201Cthe pit of despair\u201D. Each piece of the puzzle\
  \ which is felt by our hands, seen by our eyes, and touched by our hearts, leaves\
  \ an impression upon us, not only shaping our perceptions of the past, but also\
  \ how we confront our future. Humanity\u2019s story is not a puzzle of defined boundaries,\
  \ of beginnings and ends. It is a tale building upon itself. The pieces overlapping,\
  \ obscuring, missing. This is a tale we know in our heart of hearts, a song whose\
  \ lyrics are momentarily forgotten, and we need the answers we glean from the pieces\
  \ to sing those lyrics back to us, to remind us of who we are, and what our shared\
  \ past entailed. We use the tangible items uncovered to discern the ancients\u2019\
  \ thoughts, and how they tackled the problems they encountered; this knowledge helping\
  \ to recreate humanity\u2019s past in our search for meaning, in the hopes that\
  \ we may apply what we learn to the present. \n\tThe past is not a foreign entity\
  \ carved in stone, it is like the supple branches of the willow. Bending in the\
  \ breezes and gales which generations of humanity have subjected it to. It is flexible,\
  \ yet sturdy and graceful. It holds time, humanity\u2019s greatest teacher and foe,\
  \ within its grasp. It is subject to change, and yet, it creates fortifications;\
  \ patchwork walls within which the empire of mankind protects itself, masking swirling\
  \ patterns of complex thoughts, wonderments, and deceits. \n\tLife\u2019s great\
  \ tapestry is woven of shining threads and riddled with beautiful mistakes. Our\
  \ world\u2019s story is not seen in one light. There is no single way to interpret\
  \ its trials and tribulations, victories or defeats. I believe that individuals\
  \ must supplement physical records with their own version of the story, utilizing\
  \ their unique perspectives. Only then may the tale of the world be told in all\
  \ its glory; only then may it be truly seen, though it is never complete, ever growing,\
  \ and ever changing. Even our work here leaves a mark. However, it is not about\
  \ uncovering the clearest trail. It is about finding the answers and willingness\
  \ to allow them to lead us unto more, as of yet, blocked paths, more seemingly unanswerable\
  \ questions. Only through this, may we see what has been laid before us through\
  \ the avenues of the past. \n\tOur lives revolve around the telling of these stories,\
  \ and in continuing to find more ways to express them; uncovering paths to the future\
  \ within the knowledge of our past. Within these stories I find solace, and comfort;\
  \ discovering the unknown, understanding the tangled, and loving the imperfect.\
  \ And I believe that within the telling of these stories we may discover the ringing\
  \ laughter of friends in a blackened night, the gentle swaying of golden grasses\
  \ in soft currents of summer wind, and the silence belonging to sherds of broken\
  \ pottery; that which speaks to us through the rhythms of history.\n\tI break away\
  \ from my reflections and lay myself gently back in the present as my comrades and\
  \ I enter our daily predawn ritual, hastening to beat the others to the best shovels\
  \ and brushes. A slight atmosphere of competition pervading our ancient haven as\
  \ each hopes to have the \u201Cfind of the day\u201D. \n\n\t04:38am 26 July 2012\
