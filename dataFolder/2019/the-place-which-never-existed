Text: "An enormous, at least two-metre thick double door slides open, and a dark and\
  \ cool throat of the mountain is almost sucking me in. My jaw has dropped. No, I\u2019\
  m not reading you an extract from some thriller novel and my name is not James Bond.\
  \ \n  \t I\u2019m standing on the doorstep of the once top secret facility on the\
  \ Black Sea and now the naval museum complex Balaklava on the south-east of Crimean\
  \ peninsula, just a stone-throw away from the city of Sevastopol.  \n   \tFrom elegant,\
  \ marble white cities of ancient Greeks to invasion of Scythians\u2019 nomadic tribes,\
  \ from Byzantines\u2019 Orthodox churches in Chersonesus to mosques in Bakhchisarai,\
  \ two wars, numerous military conflicts, constant change of power\u2014this tiny\
  \ piece of land has seen them all. \n \t This megalithic underground submarine base,\
  \ carved deeply into Tavros Mountain, has been here on  high alert during the whole\
  \ period of the Cold War, when two mega-powers\u2014USSR and the USA\u2014tried\
  \ to control the whole world. \n   My guide snatches me back from my reverie and\
  \ invites to follow her into the dark concrete tunnel\u2014a silent witness of all\
  \ secrets of this place.  \n\tIt feels a good ten degrees cooler inside this subterranean\
  \ mega structure, but I\u2019m not surprised at all. Some 126 metres of the solid\
  \ rock above my head protects this place well not only against any weather conditions,\
  \ but even against nuclear fallout.  I\u2019m embracing my shoulders instinctively.\
  \ Despite its impressive size, this underground city seems claustrophobic to me.\
  \ Visiting it on my own without a guide or, at least, a detailed map, I would probably\
  \ got lost in the endless labyrinths of tunnels, chambers which served as warehouses,\
  \ repair shops, and dry docks, where submarines, equipment, torpedoes, and other\
  \ weapons used to be stored or repaired. \n\tOne of the tunnels opens to a channel\u2014\
  a resting place for submarines. I must admit I\u2019ve always been captivated by\
  \ these dark, slim, elegant, but deadly sea guards. There is something mysterious\
  \ in their existence deep underwater\u2014undetectable, inaudible, and unpredictable.\
  \ Now, I can see their \u201Cnest\u201D, the whole subterranean city where they\
  \ came to rest, to be repaired, and looked after. \n\tYes, to look after for almost\
  \ fifty years\u2026 Object 825 GTS was not just a maze of some industrial premises.\
  \ It was a high-security compound completely isolated from the external environment\
  \ which provided autonomous air supply, equipped with powerful diesel generators,\
  \ fuel and water lines, an underground rail road, housing for staff, dining room,\
  \ kitchen, bathrooms, showers, rest rooms, command posts, and nuclear shelter\u2014\
  everything and everybody here was absolutely prepared for a nuclear disaster. \n\
  \tHowever, even a nuclear attack seemed less dangerous for the USSR government those\
  \ days than the information leaking out to the west. The employees of Object 825\
  \ GTS couldn\u2019t disclose their real employer even to their families and close\
  \ friends. \n\tCamouflaged from the sea by the naturally curved shape of Balaklava\
  \ Bay, hidden deeply into the mountain, classified top secret project\u2014this\
  \ place has never existed until the early 2000s. \n\tA pleasure boat full of tourists\
  \ is entering slowly the channel. Some people are waving to us, and I\u2019m smiling\
  \ and waiving back to them. The channel opens to the dark blue waters of the bay,\
  \ where dolphins jump out of the waves, playing and following boats. Their black\
  \ streamline bodies remind me of submarines. \n\tI\u2019m squinting because of the\
  \ bright sun and smiling to myself. The uncertain, paranoid times of the Cold War\
  \ are over. Now, nature not the weapons controls these waters."
