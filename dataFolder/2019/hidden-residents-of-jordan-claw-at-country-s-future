Text: "The heaviness of the hot Jordanian sun beat down from above, as a warm, gentle\
  \ breeze stirred dust down one of Amman\u2019s winding street towards us. A faint,\
  \ high meowing seemed to be coming from behind a nearby dumpster. I thought the\
  \ heat and jet lag \u2013 combined with my second qahwa aswaad of the day (\u201C\
  black coffee\u201D in Arabic) \u2013 seemed to finally be getting the best of me.\
  \ Was I really hearing kittens? I thought to myself. I hadn\u2019t seen a single\
  \ one over the previous four days of orientation and sightseeing in the Hashemite\
  \ Kingdom. \n\nWith no heed to my reluctance and protests about traversing down\
  \ the side street in search of the source, my animal-loving friend Kate trudged\
  \ eagerly ahead until she stopped at the dumpster. A few soft meows on her part,\
  \ and moments later, a small, gray-and-white-striped cat cautiously emerged and\
  \ approached my crouched friend. As I stood there watching the interaction, continuing\
  \ to sweat through my light-colored linens, I found myself bending to greet our\
  \ new friend. His soft fur stuck to our damp legs and, as he warmed up to us, Kate\
  \ and I were treated to a few sandpapery licks.\n\nPasserbyers gawked at the sight\
  \ of two obviously foreign women stopped to give attention to a cat, animals we\
  \ later discovered to be consider little better than a pest. When we finally dragged\
  \ ourselves away from his imploring face and back to our group\u2019s meeting point,\
  \ our guides dismissed our excitement as a strange Western fascination with animals,\
  \ alien to the Jordanians. My initial skepticism about petting a stray, street creature\
  \ in this foreign country soon melted into a curiosity about the feline secret of\
  \ the city.\n\nMonths earlier, one of my professors at Northwestern University,\
  \ a veteran journalist of the Chicago Tribune who reported in the Middle East in\
  \ the 1990s, joked with us that he\u2019d always wanted to write a story on the\
  \ cats of the region, that they could even be the key to forging peace. While I\
  \ laughed in the moment, my sightings of these skittish street animals on the outskirts\
  \ of cafes and amongst the rocky brush beside the road would make me reconsider\
  \ my view of a possible feline litmus test.\n\nIn the mornings before our commute\
  \ to school, Kate would feed pieces of her ham and cheese croissant to some of the\
  \ stray cats milling around the trash cans. From behind the screens of their smartphones\
  \ or through the clouds of cigarette smoke that perfumed the patio, our fellow patrons\
  \ varied their responses from preoccupied indifference to incredulity to open disgust.\
  \ \n\nOur host families, familiar with Western impositions on their culture, fell\
  \ on different points of the spectrum of attitudes towards their feline residents.\
  \ Kate\u2019s family initially had unsuccessfully tried to warn her against interacting\
  \ with these possible carriers of disease. Eventually, they warmed enough that they\
  \ began leaving out leftovers and scraps for one their host students named Montaz\
  \ (\u201Cexcellent\u201D), Kate would excitedly to me as she tore off bits of her\
  \ breakfast to hand feed to a skinny orange tabby sitting underneath her black metal\
  \ Starbucks patio chair.\n\nMy host family, to my surprise, kept a massive white\
  \ stray in their home as their own. Raed (\u201Cthunder\u201D) lived up to his name\
  \ with a low, rumbling purr that was infrequent but also strangely soothing. His\
  \ presence in the home was mostly thanks to my host brother, Samir, who loved animals\
  \ and lived at home after returning from higher education in America and Israel.\n\
  \nBy the time I was packing my bags to return home, I understood these many attitudes\
  \ towards Jordanian street cats as an indicator of the many views of change slinking\
  \ into the nation from their strong alliances with the West despite a culture deeply\
  \ rooted in a traditional Middle Eastern identity. Strays represented the hidden\
  \ prospect of a globalized Jordan that would be able to participate in the world\
  \ economy if it was willing to house some progressive ideas that upset social norms\u2014\
  \ a Jordan that many feared, few acknowledged and even fewer welcomed. Like faint\
  \ meows on a side street, I almost missed it."
