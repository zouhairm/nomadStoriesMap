Text: "It is a well known fact that exploring world  is a dream of  every individual\
  \ soul.Few people can only  come out with the possibilities of traveling around..And\
  \ so I am..My name is Vaibhavi Vyas..I am born and raised in Gwalior the province\
  \ of Madhya Pradesh..the city well known for its history and  traditions.. which\
  \ creates a sense of curiosity to know more about the world.. Since childhood I\
  \ was so passionate  about  visiting new places, communicating with the local people\
  \ which helps me grasping more about that particular place,I always keep my stuff\
  \ ready..and whenever I get the chance from my schedule I step out  to witness new\
  \ places. Here I would like to share some of my experiences which I collected during\
  \ my trips..\n As far I look  back my journey of exploring India was started from\
  \ North India where we began with road-trip from  Delhi to Haridwar where I  felt\
  \ myself connected with the holy spiritual activities..then we went to Rishikesh\
  \ where I experienced water sports like river rafting etc.that was actually an adventurous\
  \ moments of my life.then we  head towards Dehradun Masoori,Shimla and Kullu Manali..where\
  \ I captured heavenly nature scenes,ravishing water falls and snow falls. Then,I\
  \  visited  the most enchanted place named Goa along with my  cousins ..And if we\
  \ look back in the history of Goa it was surrounded with Portuguese..and till date\
  \ it shows the reflection of Portuguese culture which delighted me with all its\
  \ beautiful colours..\nAfter this trip I went to Chennai to visit my cousin's place\
  \ ..also to reconnoitre the South Indian lifestyle and fast corporate life .. there\
  \ is a long list of my explorations which I pen down in my travel dairy  till date\
  \  and  yet more adventures to come .."
