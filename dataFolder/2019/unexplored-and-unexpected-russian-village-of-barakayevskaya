Text: "As my Flight prepare to land in krasnodar airport a city in south of russia\
  \ , I look through the flight window and see small powder of snow falling, my heart\
  \ has a mixture of excitement and worry, I am thinking will I be able to cope with\
  \ the sub-zero temperatures of russia which is famous around the world and then\
  \ again I am saying to myself,  I came to russia to experience this harsh and challenging\
  \ conditions. I collect my luggage and head out of the airport the snow fall starts\
  \ to get heavy and its around 4:10 p.m, it's start to get dark. Language is the\
  \ biggest challenge that I will face, I knew from my summer visit. \nBefore leaving\
  \ home I had contacted Veronica, in the village of 'Barakayevskaya' through the\
  \ internet and she and her 3 kids accepted my request to host me for 3 weeks in\
  \ my quest for russian adventure. The village is Located around 225 kms from the\
  \ city of Krasnodar and veronica had arranged a blah blah car for me to reach the\
  \ village, but unfortunately the car won't take me all the way to the village and\
  \ I have to reach a town called 'Mostovskoy' which is around 28 kms away from 'Barakayevskaya'\
  \ my final destination and where a friend of her will pick me up to take me to my\
  \ final destination. Remember I have never met this people before in person who\
  \ has chose to host me or take me to my destination.\n\nAs I stand near a cafe outside\
  \ the airport, where I was asked to wait and enjoy the snowfall, I see a guy comes\
  \ running towards me from the other side of the road as soon as he reached near\
  \ me, in his russian accent asks me ' wasim' Mostovskoy, I say 'Da' and he grabs\
  \ my rucksack and takes it to the other side of the road for a minute I was confused\
  \ and then realised he is my driver so I run behind him and upon reaching the car\
  \ just put my hand luggage in the back of the car and get in the car for my journey.\
  \ As we start driving the darkness has already descended and the snowfall getting\
  \ heavy, I am on my way to the unknown and as we drive through the city I see the\
  \ snowfall in those orange street light and reminds me of stories that I have read\
  \ in my school days. After a Journey of 3 hours and 40 minutes I reach the town\
  \ of 'Mostovskoy' around 8 p.m and the ride cost me around 800 rubles. The driver\
  \ drops me in front of an ATM near the town mall as instructed to him and leaves.\
  \ In a small town at that time of the evening you will hardly find anyone, all confused\
  \ and shivering from cold wind I go inside the ATM and take respite from the cold,\
  \ where suddenly an army man walks in, getting scared after what we hear about russian\
  \ army I avoid eye contact but he initiates a conversation in broken english and\
  \ me with my broken russian tell him about my destination and that I am waiting\
  \ for a friend to pick me up. After waiting for 20 minutes I step outside to see\
  \ if someone is coming to pick me up and in that moment a shabby looking car stops\
  \ in front of me and a guy with big beard comes out and  ask me 'wasim' I go da\
  \ and he opens the back of his car, I just put my bags and get in the car. As we\
  \ start driving and leave the town he introduce himself as 'Sergey' . After driving\
  \ for 40 minutes, we reach a small bridge and after crossing it I see few houses\
  \ but most of the parts I just see forest next to the river. I was scared but also\
  \ excited and after 10 minutes I reach the house in the middle of the forest where\
  \  I would spend amazing 3 weeks with my host family and once I meet them I feel\
  \ more relaxed and finish my journey to the unknown."
