Text: "Taking the plunge off of the zodiac into the Pacific Ocean, the cold waves\
  \ swallowed me whole. Opening my eyes to the depths of the ocean, sea lions and\
  \ schools of fish circled my view. As the sunlight glistened, I could feel the warmth\
  \ on my back as I snorkelled between the Galapagos Islands. Cloud nine revealed\
  \ itself to me in the form of nature and all that was Charles Darwinian. I had never\
  \ visited South America, nor had I ever experienced such pristine environmental\
  \ conditions. \n\nAt sixteen, I was searching for adventure. I was looking for a\
  \ way to satisfy my craving of wanderlust. The opportunist that I am, I left for\
  \ Ecuador without my family, travelling for the first time without my parents. I\
  \ was lucky to study biology for a month and make the islands my home away from\
  \ home. The Galapagos Islands, to me, were one big question in which I was searching\
  \ for an answer. Everything about the Islands were unknown, with such small populations,\
  \ barely any tourists, no media coverage, and thousands of species I had never heard\
  \ of. \n\nWith one step off of the zodiac, I had entered another realm of life.\
  \ The wildlife of the Galapagos Islands are respected by the people in the same\
  \ way that they respect each other. The underwater realm was untouched compared\
  \ to the water that I had experienced near my home. There were thousands of fish\
  \ and only a few humans taking in the astonishing beauty. It was the first time\
  \ I felt like an intruder, forcing myself into an underwater home.\n\nWith only\
  \ my own thoughts to accompany me during my snorkel, I was able to take in the ultimate\
  \ beauty that surrounded me. It was impossible to feel alone when sea lions only\
  \ wanted to be my friend. Of course, we shared one similar quality; we were both\
  \ incredibly curious creatures swimming in the vast sea. They were unfazed by my\
  \ fragile teenage human body. They weren't confused or fearful. They were magnificent.\n\
  \nI felt so guilty that I was able to uncover the open ocean and islands while the\
  \ majority of the world will never have the same opportunity. Its beauty deserves\
  \ to be seen by the world, but making it known would only destroy the pristine environment.\
  \ It was a secret best kept to myself and those I was with. Our guides made this\
  \ very clear.\n\nBefore I knew it, I was back on the zodiac speeding toward the\
  \ main boat to dock on the nearest major island, Santa Cruz. We left behind the\
  \ newly uncovered underwater world. With the smell of salty air, wind in my hair,\
  \ sun on my face, memories flooding my mind, and sea turtles circling the boat,\
  \ I knew I made the right decision of where I wanted to spend the summer. The unknown\
  \ finally became familiar."
