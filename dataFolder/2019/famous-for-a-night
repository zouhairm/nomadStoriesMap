Text: "Famous for a night\n\n\n\nImagine that for approximately 20 minutes you are\
  \ the star of the show. Imagine 33,000 persons looking at you, clapping at you.\
  \ TV cameras staring at your face and that translates into millions of eyes over\
  \ you. \nYou are the soul of the party, you must encourage the crowd to clap, sing,\
  \ dance with you. A dream!\n\nWell, when I was in Sao Paulo, Brazil, I had the opportunity\
  \ to participate at the parade of a Samba School, Imperador do Ipiranga during Carnival\
  \ season. \n\nA group of Mexicans were invited to participate in this colourful\
  \ and fun event as in that year this school was going to represent Mexico in their\
  \ parade. Brazil must always mark presence in the enredo (song), so the only link\
  \ was when in 1970 Brazil won the World Cup celebrated in Mexico. Enough! It was\
  \ double powerful to be able to represent our own country in a very Brazilian event\
  \ as the Carnival.\n\nWe first went to the rehearsals, on an area in S\xE3o Paulo\
  \ where normally you won\xB4t go as it is catalogued as risky area. Most of the\
  \ samba schools are immersed in poor areas and this gives the parade a very significant\
  \ touch, as no matter whom you are, once you are disguised you can be the queen\
  \ of the school, the best honour someone can have.  And talking about these ladies,\
  \ as a woman I could only see the real meaning of perfection on a body standing\
  \ over immense heels. \nThe origin of Samba remotes to when slavery was present\
  \ in Brazil, so this was something that came with Africans and therefore forbidden,\
  \ but with time, it became one of the references of this great country.  \n\nFor\
  \ big part of the participants, the parade is all about party and fun, while for\
  \ the leaders of the samba school represents the goal of their life, year through\
  \ year. Our contact takes his annual break from one month in advance before Carnival\
  \ season in order to devote his time to imagine, think, organise,  breath and work\
  \ on what they will represent during the parade. It is not just a tradition, but\
  \ a life style. \nAfter all, for both cities, S\xE3o Paulo and Rio de Janeiro, this\
  \ samba school parades are the biggest competition among all. \n\nOn the day, before\
  \ the parade starts, the leaders are really looking for all the little and invisible\
  \ details. Needle on hand they will attend any last-minute adjustment. You are not\
  \ allowed to wear jewellery, or any kind of accessories that is not part of the\
  \ fantasia (disguise) as they are looking for unanimity and perfection.\n\nMy wing\
  \ was representing the soldiers of Mexican Independence; therefore, we were wearing\
  \ a suit that looked like a uniform, with trousers, long sleeves and boots. All\
  \ fake, all so real, not dull at all, but cheerful, colourful, full of feathers,\
  \ bright and charm.\nWe were very lucky to be the second school to perform so our\
  \ time at the concentration area was not so long, but enough to see a lot of drunken\
  \ people, who were going to dance in the next hours. Just imagine on which conditions!\n\
  \nSo finally, we were ready, all in position. I was able enough to get the edge,\
  \ so I could be seen by my family, but also to be closer to the crowd. \n5, 4, 3,\
  \ 2, 1\u2026. The gigantic gates were open, and the music of the school started\
  \ to roar. The hole school, 2,500 persons with five allegoric cars started to perform.\
  \ We had to sing, dance the choreography learnt, interact with the audience in order\
  \ to make the most cheerful, most noisy, most clapped, most everything best performance,\
  \ as this represents a grade for the school.\n\n530 meters and 60 minutes for the\
  \ hole school to dance, sing, feel and experience deep in your marrow the passion\
  \ of this Brazilian party. With people interacting with you, with all the participants,\
  \ but feeling that is you who they came to see. TV cameras passing a few centimetres\
  \ from your face, confetti falling over you, and joy, joy, joy. A memorable experience,\
  \ a once in life must do."
