Text: "I rode bus number 14. On the screen of my phone a big blue arrow was slowly\
  \ tracing the road. I placed my two fingers to zoom out the map and the road shrank,\
  \ revealing intricate networks that made up this digital impression of Tokyo. I\
  \ zoomed in and out, all the while the blue arrow always kept its original size.\
  \ I admired how unbothered it was by the changing scale of things.\nI had about\
  \ forty minutes of bus time, which I spent mindlessly watching the scenes outside.\
  \ On this bus wheeling through the neighborhoods of Mitaka I was a blue arrow, a\
  \ passenger and a viewpoint. Also, a first-time visitor of Tokyo and a first-time\
  \ solo traveler, on her way to her first onsen.\nSoon enough I found myself stepping\
  \ onto a sidewalk. Two other passengers also got off the bus, but they scurried\
  \ away in an instance. I stayed there to study my map. Next to me, hovering a few\
  \ meters above the ground was the Chuo Expressway. It laid perpendicular to the\
  \ road on the ground, sending down ripples of whooshing sounds made by invisible\
  \ vehicles. From this point I was supposed to walk for another seven minutes.\n\
  I crossed the road and passed a few houses before turning right, entering a street\
  \ adjacent to the rows of concrete footings of the highway. On my screen the blue\
  \ arrow was on track, casually making its way alongside the yellow expressway. Down\
  \ here, next to the four-pronged claws of the giant gray structure, I felt very\
  \ small.\nI arrived to feel slightly underwhelmed. I thought an onsen would be bigger,\
  \ but to me the bathhouse sat there looking almost like another house in a row of\
  \ houses. I closed my map, climbed the wooden porch and walked through the screen\
  \ doors. Once inside, I did everything as per my research: stored my shoes, got\
  \ the locker key and towels, and made sure I entered the right bathing area (I checked\
  \ for the kanji sign for female).\nThe water was really black. It sounded cool online,\
  \ black water onsen. Black, suggesting mystery, energy, the universal.  Black, like\
  \ it contained ancient wisdom. But to me it was first black, like the dirty, mosquito-larvae-infested\
  \ sewer in front of my grandparent\u2019s old house that I visited so many times\
  \ as a kid.\nNevertheless, I got over my initial repulsion quickly. Soon I was submerged\
  \ in the cola-colored hot baths, snoozing away. I made a point to try out every\
  \ pool both indoor and outdoor. I paid multiple visits to the ones shaped like big\
  \ clay pots which could only fit one person at a time. Curled inside the pot, I\
  \ felt like a baby in a womb.\nI ended my bath with a visit to the sauna, followed\
  \ by a quick seated shower. I dried myself, put on my clothes and sat there for\
  \ some time to finish the bottle of juice I had had in my bag since morning. Afterwards\
  \ I sat in front of the mirror to dry my hair. The woman next to me used a very\
  \ generous amount of the provided body lotion and I did the same.\nI left the onsen\
  \ slightly hungry but because I had to save money I decided to skip the in-house\
  \ dining. I stepped outside and sat on the bench at the front, not quite feeling\
  \ like leaving yet. Before long another woman, one I recognized from inside the\
  \ bath, appeared. She also sat on the bench, and for a while we both sat there,\
  \ quietly. \nOnce I decided to leave I walked slowly\u2014passed the rows of houses,\
  \ the parking lots, the vending machines. My phone with its map and its unbothered\
  \ blue arrow was somewhere inside my backpack.\nIt was summer in Tokyo. The day\
  \ was shyly shifting into night and the sky was serving its bluish-purple shade.\
  \ The waves of highway noises were louder and more frequent than before. I saw some\
  \ children and thought about the children of this neighborhood growing up, possibly\
  \ leaving this place only to realize how much they could miss the sound of rubber\
  \ wheels zooming a few meters above the ground."
