Text: "As soon as you arrive in Basel, once you are asked about the highlights of\
  \ the Swiss city divided by the Rhine into two parts, you will be surprised by a\
  \ phrase that will be repeated frequently in your ears: \"Here in Basel, you can\
  \ have dinner in Switzerland, Drink your coffee in France and complete your shopping\
  \ tour in Germany. \"\n\nIf you ask how this will happen, the answer will be answered\
  \ by a quick look at the map of Basel you will get once you arrive at any hotel\
  \ in it. Then you will discover that this city is a point of convergence with the\
  \ Swiss border with Germany and France. The language of the people of Basel is Dreil\xE4\
  ndereck, meaning \"the corner of the three countries\".\n\nIf you stand at the head\
  \ of this triangle, which is located on the Swiss territory, Germany will be on\
  \ your right, France on your left, and the Rhine is the common factor between the\
  \ three countries. While Germany connects with France bridge bridge on the banks\
  \ of this river, the German-Swiss border connected to the ground , While the Swiss\
  \ citizen needs to go to France to enter the German border through the bridge, which\
  \ arrives in France or through the boats that will pass to the French bank from\
  \ the Rhine, as well as another group of tunnels linking the three countries for\
  \ the transit of cars.\n\nIn this border triangle between Switzerland, Germany and\
  \ France, she investigated this unique phenomenon at the border between nations\
  \ and explored the experience of people in this region in coexistence and how they\
  \ were able to break the barriers that governments put between human and human,\
  \ Even cultures.\n\nThe taxi drove us from the heart of Basel to the monument in\
  \ the Swiss part of the Drawn Lloyd Rick, the first thing you would see in this\
  \ monument other than the arrows pointing to the direction of each of the three\
  \ countries by putting their flag on the private stock This is the charming phrase\
  \ of the famous Indian poet and writer Sri Chinmoy, who says, \"Through inner peace,\
  \ we can reach freedom.\" As if this monument was built and written on it, it was\
  \ meant to become a symbol of peace, which can only be achieved If peoples are free.\n\
  \nNature was at the top of its brilliance last Monday morning as we stood in front\
  \ of this monument, which refers to the three countries. You feel as you contemplate\
  \ this region that it is like a charming smile on the face of a Swiss virgin. The\
  \ greenery and the sturdy trees that envelop the place can heal the eye wounds.\
  \ Its blind nerve, and \"Rhine\" with its youth and violence barely shudder the\
  \ silence of this terrible silence that hangs on this magical spot as people are\
  \ busy doing their work this morning.\n\nIn the minutes we took as we moved towards\
  \ the German border, from where we would go to France, I asked the driver about\
  \ the nature of human relations in the three countries, who live in this region\
  \ bilingual (German and French), and sometimes with an inheritance of fire, blood\
  \ and tears (France and Germany) \"People here melt with each other. They move freely.\
  \ Germans and French work in Basel, Switzerland, as an industrial city full of factories.\
  \ French and Swiss shop from the German side of the border for cheap prices. Germans\
  \ and Swiss eat their food in the French part.\n\nIt was close to 11 am when we\
  \ arrived on the German side of Dreil\xE4ndereck, Without any introductions, we\
  \ found ourselves in front of the \"Three Nation Bridge\" built on the Rhine, which\
  \ links the German West Bank with its French counterpart and the winner of the Best\
  \ Design Award in 2009, the date of its opening.\nOn this pedestrian and bicycle\
  \ crossing bridge you can observe the cross-crossing between the German and French\
  \ sides of the border. \"Life in this region has been an example of peaceful coexistence\
  \ among peoples for hundreds of years. Some of the love stories that have crossed\
  \ the border in this region."
