Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find my culinary awakening deep in Mexico\u2019s narco\
  \ territory. \n\nMy cousin, Elena, and I had arrived in Dolores, Chihuahua, a small,\
  \ idyllic rancho where our family was from. It was nestled in a lush valley within\
  \ a fortress of nauseatingly winding dirt roads, deep canyons, and the jagged, jutting\
  \ cliffs of the Sierra Tarahumara. The mountains enveloped Dolores in a tiny oasis\
  \ consisting of slanted green hillsides, pristine fertile soil and - we would soon\
  \ find out - dangerous activity. We wouldn\u2019t know it, but Dolores was located\
  \ inside The Golden Triangle, an area that was unofficially cordoned off by the\
  \ druglords du jour, as a remote location for hiding and growing fields of marijuana\
  \ and poppies for heroin production.\n\nAs we groggily unpacked our bags from the\
  \ back of the janky pickup truck we rode into town, swaths of Jeeps loaded with\
  \ young men in military green rode toward us, strategically slowed down to get a\
  \ look at the new women in town, then sped up and drove down the main dirt path\
  \ that led up to the green fields beyond the town. Their brows, like their German\
  \ rifles, gleamed under the Chihuahuan sun. \n\nThat evening, our aunts and uncles\
  \ put on a welcoming feast of freshly-killed pig: crispy fried pork skin that looked\
  \ like stained glass, and unctuous, salty pork meat all wrapped in thick, handmade\
  \ tortillas. The rich soil, so coveted for its drug-growing abilities, was also\
  \ known to cultivate the finest sugar cane stalks, which Dolores was known for.\
  \ They were turned into an unrefined, crystalline brown sugar known as piloncillo,\
  \ which was melted down and drizzled over the contours of the flan we ate for dessert\
  \ that night.\n\nAn old man, an unknown uncle, handed me a water bottle filled with\
  \ a clear liquid that smelled acrid, intoxicating. My hands squeezed the flimsy\
  \ crackling plastic as I took it up to my lips and drank. In that moment, I became\
  \ aware of what it meant to physically burn from the inside of your throat. This\
  \ moonshine, lechuguilla, was smoky, rough, and organ-searing. After a couple more\
  \ swigs, I was drunk.\n\nBeyond the blurry lights of the festivities, the moonlight\
  \ shown down on the young military men on patrol in the distance off the main dirt\
  \ artery. They were constantly there, a haunting specter that became normalized\
  \ within the town. The inhabitants, my family, had no choice but to tolerate their\
  \ presence.\n\nIn my drunken euphoria, I decided that I wanted to walk back to the\
  \ house we were staying at. I began to make my way up the dirt road in the dark\
  \ mountain stillness, passing soldiers by as they stood in the shadows of the adobe\
  \ awnings. Their rifles also caught the moonlight briefly, a reflection so smooth\
  \ and shiny like the grease dripping off the pork skin from earlier.\n\nAfter walking\
  \ more than expected, I realized I was lost. It was only a 3-minute walk to the\
  \ house, but I was drunk and alone in an unknown place. Panic and paranoia set in,\
  \ as now I felt footsteps behind me. I was being followed.\n\nI walked a couple\
  \ more steps when I heard a voice. I ignored it and walked faster.\n\n\u201CHey!\u201D\
  \n\nAgain, I ignored it.\n\n\u201CHey!\u201D They said, now louder. \n\nI began\
  \ to run.\n\n\u201CHey!\u201D \n\nThey caught up to me and grabbed my arm. I turned\
  \ around abruptly and saw Elena\u2019s exasperated face.\n\n\u201CWhy are you running?\
  \ You\u2019re going the wrong way, you know?\u201D\n\nI smiled wide and was relieved\
  \ to see her, as I thought it was surely a soldier chasing me. Or even a narco.\
  \ I overheard my uncles saying that sometimes, you couldn\u2019t really tell the\
  \ difference between them.\n\nWe made our way back to the house and ate the softest,\
  \ most flavorful handmade whole wheat bread that was punctured by melted piloncillo\
  \ pockets; it soaked up the moonshine and dropped the adrenaline rush. The impossibly\
  \ earthy and rich caramel flavors of the sugar reminded me that ingredients, food,\
  \ and the people who make it can be some of the most important and indelible expressions\
  \ of a place. That\u2019s how I wanted to remember Dolores."
