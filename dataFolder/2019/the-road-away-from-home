Text: The road away from home,it was one of the ordinary normal day,I didn't knew
  I'll end up travel to those places I did travel to,so much experiences and meeting
  a lot of people in just a couple of hours.it was Friday afternoon when I received
  a call from my older brother saying I must come to his place he need me to accompany
  him somewhere,this was no amaze to me because it wasn't the first time for him to
  ask me to accompany him.we got into the car and we traveled to Durban,a coolest
  city filled with lots of people and different experiences,an hour and a half passed,we
  got into a car again and by that time we were heading to Portshepton,that where
  it went down,people were having fun, music was playing loud everyone was having
  a good time,we joined the party and it was lit.i got got tired,went back inside
  the car to chill,next thing I was sleeping,at around 4am I woke up,then boom,I was
  in a new spot,new area and that was Stanger where we chilled at around 11 am we
  then drove to town,we met Dj fresh there,hour later on our way to our home town,at
  a garage we then met Black coffee,and for me that was an amazing experience,the
  one I didn't knew will happen in just a matter of hours.
