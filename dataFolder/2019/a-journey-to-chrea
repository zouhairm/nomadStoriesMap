Text: "One of my best decisions in my life was to visit Chr\xE9a. I thought it was\
  \ going to be a fun journey to discover a whole new region and to know more about\
  \ the native Berbers' culture, but it was way more than just this. It was like discovering\
  \ myself again. As a youngster, I was excited to begin my journey in one of the\
  \ most beautiful places in Algeria. I was looking forward to camp there, willing\
  \ to enjoy my solitude and clearing my mind. \n    I packed my belongings and hit\
  \ the road, excited and overwhelmed to climb the mountain. As I reached my destination,\
  \ I started mediating the area. Green fields as far as the eye can see, the leafs\
  \ of trees dancing by the rhythm of air creating a wonderful orchestra. My plan\
  \ was to find a place up on the mountain where I can erect my tent. So I started\
  \ climbing the mountain, I was astonished by what I saw. The way the mountain was\
  \ shaped is a piece of art and that made me wondered to the point where I accidentally\
  \ marched on a group of ants. I interrupted their highly organized structure of\
  \ work. Th  small ants were holding objects that were double their size. Everyone\
  \ of them was doing its job perfectly in tangled lanes. I was impressed with what\
  \ I saw, I was amazed by what such small creatures can do. I discovered that we're\
  \ living in such a complicated world where even the small things that cannot be\
  \ noticed most of the time can find its way to survive in such world. This group\
  \ of ants is a motivation to every human being on hard work and organization. \n\
  \    I continued my walk till I found the perfect spot for camping. I arrived at\
  \ sunset  and what a view it was. Two humongous mountains are divided by a river\
  \ with pure water and the orange light of sun was breaking the two mountains and\
  \ reflecting on the river drawing a beautiful masterpiece of mother nature. It was\
  \ a great occasion for me to take a photograph of a view that cannot be described\
  \ by words. \n    At night after erecting my tent, I went out looking at the stars\
  \ , drawn in my own thoughts about life and the purpose of it. It was like discovering\
  \ myself again. It was so calm and peaceful but interrupted by the low sound of\
  \ instincts which made it even more peaceful and relaxing. \n    The next day I\
  \ woke up feeling like hangover,  that's because I wasn't familiar with spending\
  \ the night out. Sleeping outside wasn't my most pleasurable experience and that\
  \ was my only downside of the trip. I went back to the Chr\xE9a National Park where\
  \ I was expecting to find some native Berbers. Unfortunately for me I didn't find\
  \ anyone except for some tourists jus like me. I was a bit frustrated due to the\
  \ fact that I wanted to have a chat with natives and know more about their cultures\
  \ and discover them in person. It was a let down for me, time didn't help me either.\
  \ With that frustration, I went back home. \n    All in all, my journey to Chr\xE9\
  a has paid off. I really liked spending the night in the open air. It made me think\
  \ deeply about life and helped me get over my depression. I didn't expect to find\
  \ this beautiful landscapes which words cannot describe. I was a bit disappointed\
  \ not to meet some natives, but it was a great experience as I felt after it that\
  \ I'm wiser than before because I now appreciate smaller things. These kinds of\
  \ trips makes people meditate and clear their minds. Finally,  I liked this experience\
  \ a lot and I will visit Chr\xE9a again as soon as I can."
