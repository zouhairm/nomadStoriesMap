Text: "I do not expect to find a rave in a cathedral, but here I am, and I wonder\
  \ if it is a sin to be tipsy in a holy space in the early hours of the Sabbath.\
  \ A little earlier I had sat passing around cheap bottles of wine, one huddle of\
  \ friends among many spilled out on the sloping square in front of the Pompidou.\
  \ I bought a crepe from a nearby vendor, and then another, the melting Nutella and\
  \ delicately crunching sugar grains marvelously sweet on this cool night. I can\
  \ still taste the crepes\u2019 warmth as the merlot turns the air around me to velvet.\
  \ Strobe lights pulsate to the rhythm of techno beats. The soaring stone walls are\
  \ soaked in magenta, then bleed into electric blue, then green, the supplicating\
  \ pilgrims on the stained glass windows bathed in an eerie glow.\nThis is Nuit Blanche,\
  \ or White Night. It\u2019s an all-night art festival in Paris where art installations\
  \ are scattered throughout the city center: a giant glowing eyeball suspended over\
  \ a pool; an opera singer performing in a church; a documentary about torture projected\
  \ in a park; glittery dance groups and luminous art. It\u2019s surreal. \nI am with\
  \ Sulafa and Kim, whom I met six weeks ago\u2014 we are all studying abroad together.\
  \ Sulafa has a sunny laugh and loves chasing sunsets; Kim is effortlessly stylish\
  \ and easy going. They\u2019re both adventurous, which is why they were down when\
  \ I suggested that we not get accommodation for the night. After all, hostels are\
  \ expensive in Paris, and Nuit Blanche is supposed to go from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m.,\
  \ so why not just stay up? It\u2019s the kind of crazy thing you do when you\u2019\
  re 20 years old and close to broke. \nI am not tired as we leave the cathedral.\
  \ Not with this road spread out in front of me like slick oil that will carry me,\
  \ slipping and laughing, to unexplored corners and alleys of Paris. It is long past\
  \ midnight, and the city sleeps, and the street is silent and dark and damp. We\
  \ try and fail to get into overcrowded jazz bars, but stumble onto 2000s-era karaoke\
  \ at a brasserie instead, where we nurse espressos and sing Rihanna with giggly\
  \ Parisians. As the night grows later the city softens. It\u2019s nice to be out\
  \ in this in-between time, after nightlife and before dawn. The main streets that\
  \ were so choked with crowds 12 hours earlier are now completely empty. The Notre\
  \ Dame is like a gentle monster hulking against the night sky, keeping watch over\
  \ its ghost city. We pass emaciated figures frozen on a bridge. At 4 in the morning\
  \ we walk along a moonlit Seine and see a single swan float by, stark against the\
  \ dark water. \nNow I am tired. We all are. It is two hours until dawn and most\
  \ of the exhibits have closed and our feet ache. We are on a mission to find a McDonald\u2019\
  s or Starbucks open at 5 in the morning, because if anything is open it will be\
  \ a franchise, and this night needs to be talked about over hot food, in bright\
  \ light where we can see each other\u2019s wide eyes and lingering smiles. But this\
  \ is Sunday in France, which means that nothing is open. The next few hours are\
  \ filled with waiting and buses, and by the time we get back to Reims we are so\
  \ numb and hungry and thirsty and exhausted that we don\u2019t feel anything at\
  \ all, and we talk about college and being bold and doing something just to do it,\
  \ and I remember a few hours earlier, drinking wine straight from the bottle with\
  \ Sulafa and Kim, easy laughter tumbling from our lips, Paris glimmering around\
  \ us, and how I didn\u2019t expect to find that among all the glowing eyeballs and\
  \ raving churches the thing that left me most wonderstruck was inside myself: a\
  \ warmth deep within my chest that felt so bright surely rays of light escaped from\
  \ my mouth, and the happy tears collected in the corners of my eyes must have left\
  \ golden trails down my cheeks."
