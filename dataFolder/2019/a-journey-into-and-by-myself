Text: "As a child, I grew up watching, and subsequently, admiring travel films and\
  \ content. I remember coming back from school as an excited 9 year old, only to\
  \ grab a glass of cold lemonade in my knickers, hop in front of the TV screen, and\
  \ switch the channels to TLC, where pretty girls with pretty clothes went on exciting\
  \ adventures every day -- I never considered living a life like theirs, perhaps\
  \ owing to the limiting realism which often strains my imagination, but I do remember\
  \ admiring them greatly. \n\nFast forward to years later, I was pursuing Journalism\
  \ at the best arts' college in India and some internships later, also had enough\
  \ money to afford to go on adventures of my own. What I didn't have however, was\
  \ the company of girlfriends to go on adventures with. I was never particularly\
  \ close to any of the people in my batch and found myself in a fix -- and although\
  \ I never addressed it consciously back then, I do feel a sense of defeat when I\
  \ think about it now. Regardless, I had two options: to put my plans on hold, or\
  \ to go on a trip, solo. I picked the latter, although admittedly motivated more\
  \ by a hurt ego than by a passion to travel. \n\nThe first long weekend in October,\
  \ I packed my bag, and hopped on to an overnight bus which went went onwards to\
  \ Old Manali. There was, of course, a sense of pride associated with this act of\
  \ rebellion.  I made it a point to document (and share) the food I ate on the way,\
  \ the mountains I saw, the sounds of birds chirping at 4 am, in the most attractive\
  \ fashion, to prove to my peers that I was capable of having \"fun\" by myself.\
  \ But this had to change when I ultimately reached the little cottage I was to stay\
  \ in for the next three days. \n\nThe cottage was located at the most scenic location,\
  \ away from the noise of the main city, perched on top of a hill, breaking through\
  \ a body of clouds that surrounded it in bits and pieces. Seeing the cottage after\
  \ an hour long trek from the bus stand was an accomplishment in itself, and of course,\
  \ one that I had to document. I instantly took my phone out and tried taking a snap\
  \ or two, but alas -- \"No Network\". I hardly had a moment to gather my thought\
  \ on this no network situation, when it started pouring -- and it did not stop for\
  \ the next three days. \n\nThe next three days were thus spent inside the cottage.\
  \ My plans of having a pretty girl gang had been foiled long ago, but the plans\
  \ to go hiking and exploring were in a muck as well, and quite literally so. There\
  \ was a little library by the fireplace and an energetic mountain puppy in the cottage\
  \ who kept me company, and was the reason I got to talking to its owner, the cottage\
  \ caretaker. The days went by and before I knew it, it was time to leave. I clicked\
  \ a polaroid for the caretaker, and gave it to him. He was quite intrigued by the\
  \ idea and thanked me several times. That was that, and before I knew it, it was\
  \ time for me to leave. \n\nSeveral years later, my mother and her boyfriend went\
  \ to stay at the same place and saw the polaroid sitting atop the caretaker's desk.\
  \ \n\nI know that at this point, you must be questioning the nature of this travel\
  \ story: there is no adventure and mis-adventure, unlike the travel on the show\
  \ I used to watch. But perhaps we need to understand that most of travel experience\
  \ is internal, and not an accessory to beautify life with. When I started the journey,\
  \ I felt terribly lonely -- I did not have a single friend to accompany me and this\
  \ trip was to serve as proof of my abilities to entertain myself. But I found more\
  \ than just revenge -- I found acceptance, and that's more than what I was hoping\
  \ to get. And what's better than a little cottage in a quaint village to experience\
  \ that warmth."
