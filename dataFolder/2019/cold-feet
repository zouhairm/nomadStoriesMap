Text: "It was snowing on my drysuit. \n\nI was in no man\u2019s land\u2014Silfra.\
  \ The North American and Eurasian tectonic plates diverge at this quiet spot in\
  \ Iceland. It is the only place in the world where one is able to snorkel a narrow\
  \ passage between continental plates. The water in Silfra hovers around 2 or 3 degrees\
  \ Celsius year round but, because water is constantly flowing in, the water never\
  \ freezes.  You can see for hundreds of feet with absolute clarity, which makes\
  \ sense given the decades it takes for the water to travel through a lava rock aquifer\
  \ before reaching this spot. And yet, despite this clarity, I was unsure. \n\nI\
  \ am known in my social circles as the look before you leap type. My mother describes\
  \ my early attempts at walking as studious observation of others followed by intentional,\
  \ trepidatious attempts at ambulation.  I soberly observed my early failures and\
  \ cautiously kept at it.  This fearful baby grew into a wallflower teenager\u2014\
  the kind who slowly waded into the shallow end at pool parties rather than jump,\
  \ feet first, into the fray. I was no less shy as an adult. And yet, here I was\u2014\
  gearing up for an icy plunge. \n\nIceland had been a stunning transit into the seemingly\
  \ unknowable. I had spent the last week winding my way through unthinkably beautiful\
  \ landscapes. Geysers so hot they could kill you and so powerful, they left you\
  \ feeling humorously weak. Waterfalls that appeared to emerge from nowhere; hot\
  \ springs that seemed powered by the underworld. On the drive to Silfra, at the\
  \ northern end of Thingvellir National Park, I could hardly tell where the horizon\
  \ was\u2014the snow blanketing the hills as thick and luscious as the snow falling\
  \ from above. And on my last day in this dreamy landscape, I found myself perfectly\
  \ primed the unknown. \n\nI looked like a busted tin of biscuits in my drysuit.\
  \ Chubby cheeks pushed out of the mask, snow falling on my lips. I had arrived in\
  \ two pairs of fuzzy leggings, a thermal shirt, and a sweater. They put me into\
  \ a full body quilt when I arrived and handed me a pair of flippers, a set of gloves\
  \ with three finger pockets (\u201Cthree of your fingers will have buddies to keep\
  \ them warm, your thumb is fine alone, and your index finger will just have to tough\
  \ it out\u201D), and a set of goggles I was instructed to spit in to prevent fogging.\
  \ I was promised cookies and hot chocolate afterwards.\n\nWe trudged over to the\
  \ drop in point where I was instructed to put on my flippers. Happily, this wasn\u2019\
  t a \u201Cjump in with both feet\u201D scenario. The silky mud would puff into clouds\
  \ and distort our view. I went in, one penguin-footed step after another. Slowly,\
  \ yet suddenly, the unknown became knowable. \n\nI grew up in mountainous Arizona\
  \ but nothing could have prepared me for the craggy, brilliantly spooky, terrain\
  \ of this in-between space. Gloriously silent\u2014except for my rapid breath and\
  \ snorkel-muffled gasps\u2014I entered a state of auditory deprivation as my body\
  \ attempted to acclimate to the bone-chilling water. We wound our way through chambers\
  \ of the fissure\u2014corridors varying in their depth and width but all of them\
  \ making me feel distinctly uneasy. It was as if some water-dwelling giant had entered\
  \ a forgotten space and tried, haphazardly, to shore it up with imposing boulders\
  \ tucked into place with splinters of igneous rock. The masses near the top glowed\
  \ rusty orange which faded into bronzed green before disappearing into deep navy\
  \ blues.  My breathing slowed as I gently propelled myself forward, eager to see\
  \ every bit of it; forgetting that this would mean putting it behind me. In what\
  \ seemed like moments, we had reached the end. I popped my head out and, with lips\
  \ several times larger than usual, asked my guide to let me swim around a bit more.\
  \ \n\nI completed a few tiny laps before emerging as I entered\u2014slowly yet suddenly.\
  \ With sharp clarity, I realized that steady steps into the unknown, buttressed\
  \ by leaps of self-belief, are powerful partners."
