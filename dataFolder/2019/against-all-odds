Text: "November 2014\n\nIt was a misty and cloudy morning as I stared at the plane's\
  \ window. I just landed in Frankfurt, Germany, the first European country my feet\
  \ had stepped in. Nope, I was not visiting this city, I just had a few-hour transit\
  \ before I reached my last destination, Paris, France.\n\nHundreds of people lined\
  \ up to get off the plane, I was there alone, trying to figure out what to do next\
  \ since it was my first long-haul flight to the unknown. Yes, it was my first trip,\
  \ my first journey taking a plane and my first visit to the other country and continent.\
  \ I had always been afraid to get on the plane, but that day, the excitement outweighed\
  \ the fear, the joy conquered all the horror.\n\nFrankfurt airport is a huge place,\
  \ I myself was so much bewildered by its magnificent view, not to mention that it\
  \ has so many passageways and I was also lost to find the immigration gate.\_\n\n\
  I finally saw the queue through the gate and I held my passport with me. As my turn\
  \ came in, there was one big guy standing in front of me asking a few questions.\
  \ He interrogate me what I was going to do in Paris and asked me for some additional\
  \ documents to prove my visit. I handed him a pile of documents I brought with me\
  \ and he read them thoroughly.\_\n\nAs my passport stamped, he let me go through\
  \ the gate and continue my journey to catch a connecting flight, which was less\
  \ than an hour to go. I was in hurry and looking for the next gate to board. I probably\
  \ didn't notice that I had to go to another line and conducted a security check,\
  \ and there I was. After running through the alleys, I found out that I had to go\
  \ through the scanner. I was in line with other hundreds of passengers before we\
  \ caught our flights.\_\n\nThere was one female officer asking me to take off my\
  \ jacket, boots and cap. She searched my body as if I had something illegal. I was\
  \ with one other middle-eastern woman standing next to each other while being scanned\
  \ by the officers.\_\n\nAs a moslem traveler, traveling overseas has always been\
  \ a daunting situation regarding to that islamophobia spread out in the entire world.\
  \ My appearance can obviously be seen as a moslem because I wear my headscarf or\
  \ hijab on me.\_\n\nAfter everything was checked, the officer let me go and luckily\
  \ I could get on the plane 10 minutes before it took off.\_\n\nThe journey from\
  \ Frankfurt to Paris took approximately an hour. I was like the only moslem girl\
  \ on the plane and everyone I saw there was white European people. But the journey\
  \ went well till I reached Paris around 10 am.\_\n\nI was waiting for one of my\
  \ friends to pick me up. I was still perplexed and couldn't believe myself to have\
  \ reached the continent, also to have reached one of the most favorite destinations,\
  \ Paris.\_\n\nMy friend took me to the designated place someone has set for me and\
  \ I got few hours to rest. Again, I told you, I was beyond happy and there was nothing\
  \ called jet lag at that time. In the evening, my friend enthusiastically took me\
  \ out to see the most iconic tower in Paris, the magnificent Eiffel tower. I was\
  \ just stunned and enjoyed the sparkling tower at night and chilled for a few minutes\
  \ before taking a stroll to the Louvre museum. \_\_\n\nI didn't use to travel. In\
  \ my family, we didn't have that privilege to visit other countries because of the\
  \ expenses we have to deal with. However, I felt that my life was too tedious that\
  \ I had to break the rules. And I did. It took me days and months to convince my\
  \ parents about the journey, and they agreed on the huge leap I would take to travel\
  \ and also to learn something.\n\nTherefore, my journey to Paris was not only for\
  \ traveling, but also for studying. I had a 70-day permit to stay and study in a\
  \ course in Paris. It was like killing two birds with one stone.\n\nIn Paris, I\
  \ went to a TEFL course to get my English teacher certification. I met some amazing\
  \ new friends from several English-speaking countries. It was definitely a self-rewarding\
  \ moment that I had always dreamed of.\n\nAt school, I was the only moslem girl\
  \ and they had probably thought that I was different. But hey, I didn't feel intimidated.\
  \ I explained everything about islam, including the 5-time prayers I have to do\
  \ everyday. They let me pray. Sometimes, in the middle of discussion and prayer\
  \ time was on, I went to a tiny space near the toilet and prayed there. Nothing\
  \ was wrong, I felt appreciated. Besides, France, or more specifically in Paris,\
  \ I heard that there were many moslems living there, so I guess being a moslem in\
  \ Paris is not a big deal.\n\nMy 70-day living in Paris has taught me many lessons\
  \ and it's a life-changing as well. There, I learned how to accept differences,\
  \ how to live in diversity and how to appreciate people. Moreover, this journey\
  \ was the first move I took, against all odds."
