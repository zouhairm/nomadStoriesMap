Text: "I became one of 100 young ambassadors of ExpoFrance2025. Together with other\
  \ ambassadors I laid out the capsule of Kyrgyzstan in Paris last year.\n\nWorld\
  \ Expo is an international exhibition of technologies. First World Expo in France\
  \ was in 1889, when the Bureau of International Exhibitions (BIE) was founded there.\
  \ The Eiffel Tower was built for this event, which is today the most photographed\
  \ sight in the world. Last Expo in France was way back in 1900. No wonder, France\
  \ is serious to win the bid to host the 2025 World Expo. Russia, Japan and Azerbaijan\
  \ have also applied to the Bureau to hold the Exposition.In spring 2017, I accidentally\
  \ filled out the application. In July of the same year, I received a letter of invitation\
  \ to Paris with the notation \u201Call expenses covered\u201D. I suppose that I\
  \ am the only one who applied from Kyrgyzstan what is good for representation of\
  \ our country. Neighboring countries, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan, for example, were\
  \ not represented.\n\nI do not speak French, but it was not a problem. The organizers\
  \ acted wisely and covered more countries, even those who do not study French. Everything\
  \ was translated into English. I met young people from all over the world. We could\
  \ easily find a common language, despite the territorial distinctions. We were all\
  \ part of a globalized world. All the ambassadors were bilingual and spoke at least\
  \ one foreign language.\n\n\nFirst impressions of Paris?\n\nParis is a dream. We\
  \ settled in a 10 minute-walk distance from the Eiffel Tower. This is an area with\
  \ narrow streets, cosy restaurants and markets. Parisians love to decorate apartment\
  \ balconies with curly flowers, which suit the antique architecture there. The streets\
  \ are sensated with rich history and romance is in the air. The further you get\
  \ from the city center, the wider avenues are and industrialised.\n\n\nThe people\
  \ I met were friendly. The organizers and the service workers made the best impression\
  \ on me. In the city you always need to be on the alert. There are a lot of beggars\
  \ and speculators in touristic places. We were instructed not to buy souvenirs,\
  \ jewelry and flowers from street vendors in Paris. They are poor quality or stolen\
  \ counterfeits. We met several men walking with red roses in environs of Notre Dame\
  \ de Paris. They complement and present a rose as a gift, if you accept they start\
  \ asking for money and threatening. So, this is quite dangerous in Paris.\n\n\n\
  Paris is indeed the capital of fashion: men and women of all ages look stylish.\
  \ Unlike our fancy women, French ones prefer natural beauty.\n\nYouth Week\n\nThis\
  \ week was very busy. The program was competently planned and organized that we\
  \ could both enjoy the city and hone our ambassador roles. Before dinner we had\
  \ workshops on social media marketing tools, after we had excursions to the partners\
  \ or Expo legacy sights. At nights we had our own cultural program, walking Paris.\
  \ Unfortunately, after 5 p.m. all cultural places are closed and only bars are open.\
  \ The French work hard during the day, and in the evening they go to the bar to\
  \ rest and exchange some information. On the second day we went to the beautiful\
  \ countryside to see the territory of the future Exhibition. After the Expo, this\
  \ place will become the center of a new city.\n\nLike the tendency of last exhibitions,\
  \ ExpoFrance2025 aims at developing of green technologies too. The ExpoFrance2025\
  \ message is \u201Cknowledge to share, a planet to protect\u201D and I fully support\
  \ this concept. Cultures should exchange their best practices to sustain the world.\
  \ There are already world research centers of solar energy and one of the leading\
  \ universities on environmental studies Saclay there. We visited Saclay, its loft\
  \ style reminded me AUCA, but several times bigger. We also watched a scientific\
  \ movie \u201CA beautiful planet\u201D in a sphere. Ironically, I had already watched\
  \ this movie by AUCA\u2019s invitation. For one more time I reminded myself how\
  \ glorious our planet is, and vulnerable at the same way.\n\n\nI would suggest my\
  \ peers to learn languages, do what they passionate about and travel the world."
