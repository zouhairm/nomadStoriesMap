Text: "Well, what can I say? \n\nI really didn\u2019t expect to be so clich\xE9. I\
  \ didn\u2019t expect to find a kind of heart in Paris - a trembling center, a flashing\
  \ light, a lost murmur in the streets (oh, the beautiful streets). \n\nI mean, who\
  \ doesn\u2019t find a certain amount of love in the City of Lights? \n\nI certainly\
  \ did, back in 2012, when I backpacked around Europe with two college girlfriends\
  \ on my first adventure abroad. I was 21. Of course it was a sunny and super crowded\
  \ July. We were three young girls gasping for air and hope in the great Old World,\
  \ the last chance to really do something with ourselves before our real lives begin,\
  \ whatever that meant. \n\nEverything conspired for the most clich\xE9 events ever.\
  \  \n\nAnd yet. I didn\u2019t expect to fall in love, like basically everyone in\
  \ history, under those pinkish parisian skies. \n\nSure, Prague was almost overwhelmingly\
  \ beautiful, and I also fell head over heels in love with Lisbon, Amsterdam, the\
  \ historic Madrid. With dirty clothes, all sorts of travel parafernalia and funny,\
  \ dull, epic drunk stories, I was living my big dream in 10 countries and 32 days.\
  \ \n\nIt\u2019s funny, because I\u2019ve always thought that \u201Cmy place\u201D\
  \ would be London. I\u2019ve always had a thing with castles, and something about\
  \ the monarchy or the typical english sobriety made me believe that it would be\
  \ the destiny I would really dig. \n\nAnd there was the Big Bang, River Thames,\
  \ Kensington Palace, everything - and there was no \u201Cit\u201D. In a way, I obviously\
  \ loved it (I was simply ecstatic everywhere). But no, no spiritual voices calling\
  \ me and telling me that London was, in some mystical way, my \u201Csecret dream\
  \ spot\u201D. \n\nSo we arrived in Paris. And our hostel was located in Montmartre,\
  \ the celebrated bohemian hood that kept us just right there for the most part of\
  \ our parisian journey (there were a million things to see, but have you ever seen\
  \ Montmartre?!). \n\nAnd then my heart began to sink, in the most decadent, tender,\
  \ childish and purest way, all at once. In spite of all the glorious fame of the\
  \ city, I had also heard about Paris\u2019 somber side, the dirt, the cigarette\
  \ butts, the mass tourism, the foggy fact that the city of lights was not always\
  \ so dignified of its own beauty and literary mentions. \n\nMy cousin had told me,\
  \ \u201CIt\u2019s dirty, it\u2019s not as you imagine it at all\u201D. \n\nBut,\
  \ once I was there, I was ultimately helpless. I couldn\u2019t avoid the romanticism\
  \ I\u2019ve been trying to banish from all my life areas, because the truth is it\u2019\
  s so easier not to care at all, about anything, with such a deep level of feeling.\
  \ \n\nBut Paris made me want to peel off all my layers of adult cynicism just to\
  \ touch the naked skin of the earth. \n\nAnd I\u2019m not even talking about all\
  \ the museums and famous spots. Because the memories of Paris make me corny, I\u2019\
  m even daring to speak of a city\u2019s soul, a city\u2019s spark, something endearing\
  \ in the air. \n\n\"Paris est une promesse\", I can\u2019t remember where I\u2019\
  ve read it. \n\nParis was a feeling (maybe a definite metaphor of that summer, that\
  \ season of life), and Paris was a promise of everything I could feel, everything\
  \ that could be (not just there, but everywhere - suddenly I knew I could rescue\
  \ it even as a state of mind), and it was my secret treasure, my own Europe\u2019\
  s traveller clich\xE9. \n\n7 years later, I mainly remember colors, laughs, impressions\
  \ of being seated here and there, the beauty that exists in every tiny thing that\
  \ you lay your eyes on the streets (the bridges!), the love padlocks at Pont Neuf\
  \ (that made me think, almost sobbing inside, as corny as can be: \u201CIt really\
  \ means something to be in Paris and in love\u201D). \n\nYou know what? \n\nWe didn\u2019\
  t even go to the Louvre. We were late, it was our last day. We were sort of ashamed,\
  \ but not at all sorry. Of course I still wanna check Monalisa out, but I long the\
  \ most to find such beauty and sense of belonging on the predictable again. Who\
  \ knows?"
