Text: "\u201CAmira do you know him?\" \n\"No we just met, he wants to sell us art\"\
  \ I observe the tall handsome man and I feel unsettled yet interested. We are at\
  \ the edge of China Town entering Little Italy, when a woman on a city bike passes\
  \ with a large hat; it's the first sunny day in weeks.\n\n\"My friend's gallery\
  \ is right over in that apartment\" his thick Brooklyn accent betrays him. I know\
  \ a hustler when I see one and so for a moment I feel inclined to walk away, but\
  \ the spring breeze ebbs away my better judgment as we follow this complete stranger.\n\
  \n\"So where are you guys from? I noticed an accent\u201D he continues as we cross\
  \ the street, the apartments are towering cramped blocks of limestones and red bricks\
  \ \"Trinidad\" I reply. \u201COh for real?! I know someone from Trinidad\u201D he\
  \ says excitedly. I give Amira a look, everyone knows someone from Trinidad. \u201C\
  Her name is Veronica Adams, do you know her?\u201D I just slowly shake my head,\
  \ Trinidad is a country not a small community as people oftentimes mistake it for.\n\
  \nWe enter the building and walk up two flights of stairs when I whisper to my friend\
  \ anxiously \u201CI thought this would be a proper studio, it\u2019s his damn house!\u201D\
  she shrugs. \n\nInside the apartment it is thick and warm but the two occupants\
  \ seem unaffected by the choking heat.The first is a Hispanic man holding a camera\
  \ sitting on a chair, the only piece of furniture, and the other a pale blonde guy\
  \ with an opened shirt and cap standing and shredding a newspaper - the artist,\
  \ \"Hey\" he says casually like we are returning friends.\n\nWe look around and\
  \ there are framed art displaying shredded newspaper collages, priced at four thousand\
  \ dollars.\n\"How much is this piece?\" it's a painted white crate with the words\n\
  \ (My mother told me to wear black and move to the city) written on it.\n\n\"It's\
  \ a piece from a good friend. It's original. Two thousand\" this man is delusional.\n\
  \n\"There are more paintings in the back\" he leads the way into a room that appears\
  \ to be where he sleeps, there\u2019s a narrow mattress with crumpled sheets tucked\
  \ away in the corner. On display are several pieces of art work in different stages\
  \ of completion lined up on the wall. The most arresting picture is an image of\
  \ a woman crying with the paint smudging around her tears, her fair skin looks bruised\
  \ under pain. \n \nThe door slams shut suddenly  behind us and I jump.\"It's just\
  \ the wind, these old buildings are drafty\" he senses our discomfort, and gently\
  \ picks up the image of the woman as he smiles awkwardly. \"Beautiful isn\u2019\
  t it\"\nI nod but my eyes are focused on the only window in the room, remembering\
  \ that there must be a fire escape in case of an emergency.\n\n\"It's my Mother\"\
  \ he gently touches the paintings face\" She died when I was seven. Cancer. She\
  \ was in so much pain in the end and that's all the memories I have of her\".\n\n\
  \u201CWe should-d go\u201D Amira nervously stutters.\n\n \u201CYou could take my\
  \ number\" the artists says as he opens the bedroom door and leads us back to the\
  \ living room. The heat has suddenly become even more unbearable.\n\n\"Yeah sure\"\
  \ Amira responds quickly.\n\n\"Provided that you meet someone who may be interested\
  \ in my art\" he smiles slowly revealing perfect white squares. He reaches in his\
  \ pocket and  hands her a crumpled piece of  paper with his name and number scribbled\
  \ on it.\n\n\"No problem, I\u2019ll be sure to contact you\u201D she almost snatches\
  \ the paper from his hand.\n\n \"Are you sure?\" \n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n \n\"\
  Are you sure that you'll contact me?\" he says insistently.\n\nAmira smiles and\
  \ laughs nervously \"Yeah I will\"\n\nOutside on the streets of Manhattan once again,\
  \ I see the world around me differently. This city is so driven and hungry with\
  \ passion that it\u2019s difficult to ignore.\n\u201CThat was insane\u201D Amira\
  \ comments  \u201Cin New York everyone is trying to sell you something\u201D\n\n\
  I think for a moment \u201Cbut next time let\u2019s not follow a stranger to get\
  \ it\u201D"
