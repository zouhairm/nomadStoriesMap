Text: "On the summer of my first year in the university, which can be traced back\
  \ to 2017, I attended the university\u2019s Buddy Project and made some new friends\
  \ who I have never thought I could love them so much, two of them are Vietnamese\
  \ and one is Thai who is in the same college as I am. Before my Vietnamese friends\
  \ went back to their country, we had made a promise to pay them a visit if my Thai\
  \ friend and I have time. Fortunately, the day has come faster than we thought.\
  \ On June 2018, we flew to Vietnam.\n\n\u201CNo. I did not want to go there.\u201D\
  \ My voice inside my head started to whisper to me.\n\u201CWhat to do in Vietnam?\u201D\
  \n\u201CIt is not a good idea to go there. It is going to be the worst decision\
  \ ever.\u201D\n\u201CEspecially only two girls on board!\u201D\n\u201CThere are\
  \ some rumors that Vietnam is bad at those, Vietnam is horrible at these.\u201D\n\
  But as a promise, good friends do what they say, and here we are\u2026 Ho Chi Min.\n\
  \t\n\tThe plane landed and I felt like I could no longer hold my breath, so I let\
  \ it go and tried to be relaxed. Since we were here and there was no turning back,\
  \ everything is going to be just fine. I told myself that so many times and I could\
  \ not care to count because as soon as I stepped out of the airport, the new territory\
  \ is standing out there for me and my friend to explore. The first thing we did\
  \ was taking a bus to our hostel. Who on earth would care to take a bus instead\
  \ of a cab after having a nervous time on their flights? Especially with their carry-on\
  \ luggage? But here we were, tried to relax. \u2018When in Vietnam, do what the\
  \ Vietnamese do\u2019 is my moral.\n\n\tWe checked in our hostel and it was too\
  \ fabulous to be this cheap, a lot cheaper than average hostels in Thailand or any\
  \ countries I have been so far, which made us appreciate Vietnam more than we thought.\
  \ The best thing was not yet to come until we tried \u2018Vietnam Grab Bike.\u2019\
  \ If you have heard about Vietnam\u2019s traffic and seen the craziness on the road,\
  \ you would probably not try it. However, we were running late for our appointment\
  \ with our hostel\u2019s roomie, so we had no choice but got on the bike.\n\n\u201C\
  This is crazy. I am going to die. No. I am too young to die like this.\u201D This\
  \ was my first thought when I first got on the bike. Crazy.\n\n\tWe learned that\
  \ the drivers were smaller than us, although they were all men. In Vietnam, you\
  \ can be a little bit too big to sit at the back of the bike and feel safe, even\
  \ if you are Thai girls who live so close to this strange country. Surprisingly,\
  \ Vietnamese are all good at riding and driving. It was better and made us feel\
  \ a lot safer than taking a motorbike in Thailand! \n\n\tI went to Vietnam with\
  \ absolute no expectation, but I have earned a whole lot of good experiences. Vietnamese\
  \ food was so amazing that I would want to open a Vietnamese restaurant in Thailand.\
  \ The transportation was not that bad that I have heard about. There were many places\
  \ and people to make some new experiences with. By the end of the trip, I did not\
  \ just meet my two friends but many friends who took a very good care of the two\
  \ crazy foreigners like us and we were thankful for that. Before we said goodbye\
  \ again, I knew I was a pessimist, but more truthful than any time in my life, I\
  \ said: \u201CI have never thought I could love Vietnam this much.\u201D  I promise\
  \ by heart, I will definitely come back again."
