Text: "I have never felt more at home in another part of the world, than I did in\
  \ the beautiful city of Prague. \n\nI lived amongst the locals - ate with them,\
  \ danced with them, drank with them. They pulled me in with open arms, eager to\
  \ show me their world. My, what a beautiful world it is. \n\nCzech beer appears\
  \ to be worshipped by locals and visitors alike. I have never in my 21 (little)\
  \ years been a beer-drinker. The mention of beer would turn my face sour. What a\
  \ pleasant surprise I had while visiting the famous Beer Museum and tasting the\
  \ variety of beers. I was apprehensive at first, but one beer after another, I actually\
  \ began to enjoy it! I am still unsure as to whether it was because I had become\
  \ more intoxicated so I cared less, or if the beer was actually enjoyable. We\u2019\
  ll just assume the latter for now! \n\nPrague appears to be big on art, there is\
  \ an artist on every corner. A stroll across the Charles Bridge will have you in\
  \ awe of the pure talent Czech artists possess. You could never miss an opportunity\
  \ to take a picture in front of the Lennon Wall either. While \u201Cnormal\u201D\
  \ people would admire the artwork, I tend to question, \u201Chow do people get up\
  \ that high?\u201D It is impressive, to say the least. \n\nWinter nights in Czechia\
  \ call for a heart (and stomach) warming bowl of, national favourite, goulash with\
  \ bread dumplings. It is so delicious I could eat this delicacy over and over, day-in-day\
  \ out. Don\u2019t forget to wash it down with a cup of grog! (I had to ask a bartender\
  \ what this was, I kept seeing it everywhere and the curiosity near enough killed\
  \ me. It\u2019s basically black tea with a slice of lemon and shot of whiskey or\
  \ rum to finish it off. Quite pleasant, 10/10 would recommend). \n\nChristmas time\
  \ is such a magical time to visit Prague. Everybody gathers in the Old Town Square\
  \ to witness the Christmas tree light up, beautiful performances, and bask in the\
  \ Christmas joy! The market stalls are quaint and inviting, with so much to gawk\
  \ at - plenty of food and drink as well lovely little trinkets and souvenirs for\
  \ you to take home and cherish on your Christmas trees forever. \n\nThe Czech Republic\
  \ really has become my home away from home. A beautiful place with even more beautiful\
  \ people. I would encourage anyone to visit. I would love to go back one day, maybe\
  \ even to live."
