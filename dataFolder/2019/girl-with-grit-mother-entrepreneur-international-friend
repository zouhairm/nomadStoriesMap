Text: "I first met Chi Xiong in 2015 in Thailand where an international group of Hmong\
  \ women were planning a Hmong women\u2019s conference. The Hmong are a hill tribe\
  \ in SouthEast Asia who fought in the Secret War on behalf the Americans during\
  \ the Vietnam War. We quickly built a friendship, she was young, 25, and learning\
  \ how to speak English. She was peppy, full of life and energy.\n\nIn 2018 I decided\
  \ to visit Chi in Vietnam with my husband, Jim. We took an overnight train from\
  \ the city of Hanoi. It was an incredible experience. Not only did it save us from\
  \ paying for a hotel room, we were able to watch the city go by from our sleeper\
  \ car. We paid a little extra to reserve a private bunker, but it was well worth\
  \ the money as the sleeper cars are very small to begin with. \n\nWe arrived in\
  \ Lao Cai where Chi\u2019s uncle met us. It was an hour drive to Sapa Valley, where\
  \ Chi worked as a tour guide. She met us at the hotel she reserved for us. She looked\
  \ different from the way she did just three years ago. She looked tired, less peppy\
  \ and a lot less energy. As we were catching up, I learned that she married at age\
  \ 26 mainly because in the Hmong community, she was becoming an old maid. She married\
  \ a younger man and moved into his family\u2019s home where she quickly had two\
  \ children, both boys, a year apart. \n\nThe first floor of the local shopping mall\
  \ housed Vietnamese vendors, while the dark and cramp second floor housed Hmong\
  \ merchants. The elders wore headlamps so they could work on the intricate sewing\
  \ they did by hand. We met Chi\u2019s mother, who had a booth. We also met Chi\u2019\
  s youngest son, just a few months old, and did not yet have a name (we suggested\
  \ Jim). More than half a dozen Hmong women approached me and tried to sell me an\
  \ array of items. It hurt my heart to have to turn down these elders as I couldn\u2019\
  t buy from each of them.\n\nAs we exited, where we were promptly bombarded by merchants\
  \ ranging from 5-year-old girls selling crafts to 70-year-old women selling fabric.\
  \ Every step we took, we were asked to purchase items or hire a guide. Tourism was\
  \ the number one way of making a living in Sapa, a Vietnamese city surrounded by\
  \ Hmong villages. Hotels were constantly being built. Hmong villagers were offering\
  \ their modest homes as \u201Chomestays\u201D so westerners could experience what\
  \ it was like to live in a home with thatched roofs and dirt floors. There were\
  \ almost no jobs for the men except driving taxis, or offering rides on their motorcycles/scooters.\
  \ Other men traveled to local construction sites to offer their services. \n\nChi\
  \ took us to the home she shared with her in-laws. Her husband pulled up on the\
  \ family scooter with their 2-year-old son standing and holding onto the handlebars.\
  \ We climbed down a steep and scary mountain; somehow Chi did it with one son strapped\
  \ on her back and holding her other son. I sat with Chi as she made a fire and lunch\
  \ in the corner. They lived in a three room home with an outhouse, no electricity\
  \ and curtains for privacy. But they had cement floors, an upgrade. They raised\
  \ pigs, pigeons, chickens and had a dog running around (who had no name, they called\
  \ him \u201Cdog\u201D).\n\nAfter a delicious home-cooked meal, we made our way back\
  \ to town through the villages. I witnessed a lot of things I had seen in other\
  \ Hmong villages I had been to. But there were a lot more westerners, many were\
  \ backpacking and hired guides like Chi from the side of the road to lead them.\
  \ \n\nBack at our hotel room, we reflected on the amazing grit the Hmong women of\
  \ Sapa had. They bore children, raised them on their backs while trekking, learned\
  \ English just by working and listening to tourists. They were the breadwinners.\
  \ They were, indeed, incredible women."
