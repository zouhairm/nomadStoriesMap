Text: "Imagine a National Park in the American South West.\nImagine the sound of water\
  \ falling down from great heights.\nImagine a path with stairs made of stone, where\
  \ Humans try to weave their desires with Mother Nature`s laws.\nBorn and raised\
  \ in a city, my eyes still couldn't get used to that stunning magnificence.\nIn\
  \ many areas, the ground was slippery and muddy, so I carefully tread on the path,\
  \ letting my gaze to open up to the natural beauty, without focusing on any particular\
  \ detail.\nAll of a sudden, a few steps ahead, a sight captured my attention.\n\
  An elderly lady, slowly and prudently, was coming down from the same path where\
  \ i was, on the opposite direction. She was more or less in the middle of the trail,\
  \ totally absorbed by each small movement of her feet. In that moment, i thought\
  \ i had noticed her because of the walker, this strange, metal device which made\
  \ possible for her to scramble the footpath up to the waterfall.\nNow i know there\
  \ was something more.\nI continued on my trail, keeping her on my right and following\
  \ the roar of nature. Under the waterfall, thousands of tiny drops created fugitive\
  \ rainbows and a freezing sensation on my skin.\nThen, i started little by little\
  \ to go back to the forecourt, where the trail started. With no hurry, i let my\
  \ friend A. go ahead in order to capture some pictures of him and taking my time\
  \ to look around once more.\nPrecisely in the moment when I was looking through\
  \ the lens of my camera, i saw her again. The \u201CLady with the Walker\u201D was\
  \ having troubles with the last stairs, and just in that moment A. and another man\
  \ ran to her aid.\nI took a moment to notice how long she had been struggling with\
  \ that irregular ground, and how strong was her will to explore, her courage to\
  \ go out from the safe path of a predictable daily life.\nThen, i continued walking\
  \ to reach them and join the company.\n\u201CHi, my name is Peggy\u201D she said.\
  \ \u201CWould you like to play with us?\u201D.\nWith no clue on what she was talking\
  \ about, i shook her hand, looked at my friend and answered a curious and trustful:\
  \ \u201CYes\u201D.\nShe sat down on a stone wall, using the walker in front of her\
  \ as a peculiar desk. From her bag, as an unexpected Mary Poppins, Peggy drew two\
  \ flutes, a small bottle and a tissue. Then she started to clean the mouth of the\
  \ instruments like a ritual she had repeated numerous times and, once she had finished\
  \ with those preparations, she offered us two plastic flutes, getting her special\
  \ wooden one to show us the rules of the game.\n\u201COk, so you guys cover the\
  \ first hole with this finger, than the second and all the way down to the last\
  \ one. This is a typical Native flute, so you have a different scale. The only thing\
  \ you have to keep in mind, is to never take off the fifth finger of your left hand.\
  \ Then, you can play as you want with the rest of the notes. Easy, no?\u201D\nIt\
  \ was true. No matter how we played that scale, following her rules the sound came\
  \ out with the perfume of an ancient, native song. \nHer patience with our shaky\
  \ attempts made me understand she was used to share with every curious person on\
  \ her path the gift of music.\nNo word about her trembling legs. No self-pity, nor\
  \ anger in her voice.\nJust passion for nature, music and old rituals.\nShe spends\
  \ her life travelling through National Parks, going back home in California just\
  \ for medical reasons. Alone, on her way, she shares joy and wonder and love for\
  \ life.\nI thought it was just for her strange walker, but now i know why I already\
  \ loved her."
