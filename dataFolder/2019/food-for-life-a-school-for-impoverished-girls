Text: "As the tuk-tuk draws nearer to the school, the chaotic street noise is quickly\
  \ consumed by the joyful sounds of singing. Young girls dressed in boldly colored\
  \ uniforms, wave at us from another tuk-tuk.  They hop out and scamper through the\
  \ school gate to join their classmates in the morning ritual. The music is amplified\
  \ as the group grows. \n\nA week in India has already sensitized me to the reality\
  \ of life in a developing country; I have been approached by many barefoot begging\
  \ children. I have seen the slums where some of these children live. I feel overwhelmed.\
  \ Despite this, there is a different energy inside these walls. Even though these\
  \ girls come from poor families with limited options for food, clothing and shelter,\
  \ they are filled with delight. Every single child is participating in the morning\
  \ routine of song and dance, even the teenagers. There is a sense of respect for\
  \ the institution. The students tame their long locks into braids; their nails are\
  \ clean and trimmed. Their smiling eyes show no sign of struggle. \n\nIt is not\
  \ long before I am invited to the circle by a kindergartener. With a firm grasp\
  \ on my hand, she mitigates the crowd and delivers me to her circle of peers. Her\
  \ deep brown eyes gaze up at me while she demonstrates the movements. Her warm smile\
  \ encourages me to keep trying, even though I struggle to catch on to the choreography.\
  \ She tells me her name, but that is the extent of our conversation. We connect\
  \ through music, laughter and singing. \n\nWhen the students line up to go to their\
  \ classrooms, we meet the director of the school for a tour. She states mother-of-factly\
  \ that these girls would probably not attend school at all, if not for this establishment\
  \ and the generous donations that keep it running. I have a sudden desire to redirect\
  \ my earnings toward tuition here, knowing that just my coffee budget would pay\
  \ for one child's tuition. \n\nAt that time, breakfast is served to the children\
  \ and I am humbled to help by passing out milk to a group of shy toddlers. As a\
  \ former preschool teacher, I am amazed by the 40 plus kids lining the walls waiting\
  \ patiently without a peep. Later, we walk through the school library and visit\
  \ a few classrooms. The hallway is decorated with vibrant student artwork framing\
  \ their visions for a cleaner, greener future. For a moment, I envision my own kids\
  \ at home and our family values. As humans, we all share the same basic desires.\
  \ We are all connected. \n\nThe tour continues and I get a look at the ox-pulled\
  \ carts that serve as transportation for most of the girls; nothing more eco-friendly\
  \ than animal-powered school buses! The director provides helpful insight on the\
  \ importance of equipping students with relevant skills. In addition to the basics\
  \ of math and literacy, the girls learn crafts like sewing and embroidery. With\
  \ these skills, more opportunities are available in the labor market. Poverty-stricken\
  \ girls who do not attend school are likely to be forced into early marriage or\
  \ sold into sex trafficking. This education is life-changing in the truest sense.\
  \ To imagine the countless girls living a life of abuse is disheartening, but to\
  \ know that these girls have a chance of a better life brings a minute sense of\
  \ solace."
