Text: "It was a Wednesday afternoon. While I had lunch I was looking at my cellphone\
  \ with no purpose whatsoever, just another normal boring day. Out of the blue a\
  \ Skyscanner add pop's into my screen advertising cheap flight tickets. I clicked\
  \ on the add just out of curiosity, after all I didn't have money to travel. I was\
  \ scrolling through the promotions when one caught my eye, a round trip to South\
  \ Africa departuring from my city in four months for only 370 dolars (and it was\
  \ a direct flight). Coincidentally that amount matched exactly with my credit card\
  \ limit. Then without a second thought or a blink of an eye I bought it. \n\nHowever,\
  \ the thing is that I knew absolutely nothing about South Africa at the time, as\
  \ a matter of fact I never ever had thought of going there someday. It was a completely\
  \ impulsive decision and today I can say for sure that I regret nothing about that\
  \ moment. The mistake (or not) was already made, so I started to plan the trip and\
  \ hoped to find something more than safaris (yes, such a stereotype by my part I\
  \ know). Meanwhile I told a friend about my crazy trip adventure in Africa and he\
  \ had the same spontaneous (or impulsive) attitude that I had and just bought the\
  \ same promotional ticket that I did. It was a seven days trip and we decided to\
  \ divide the journey between two cities: Cape Town and Johasnnesburg. We planned\
  \ to stay 4 days in the first one and 3 days in the second one. \n\nBy the time\
  \ we got there I already discovered that the country had so much more to offer than\
  \ I could ever imagine. Cape Town is a real gem for all kinds of travellers. Among\
  \ the many activities that we did the highlights were: \n1) Watching the sunset\
  \ in Camps Bay Beach (a beautiful beach surrounded by a amazing mountain range);\n\
  2) A one day trip to the Cape of Good Hope (where many shipwrecks happened in early\
  \ centuries) with a lot of beautiful stops in the way (specially Bouderls Beach\
  \ where we could see penguins);\n3) Boo Kap (a street where all the houses have\
  \ different vibrant colors);\n4) V & A Waterfront (a place with many restaurants,\
  \ shopping malls and the Cape Wheel);\n5) Table Mountain (there is the most stunning\
  \ hiking trail to the top).\n\nAfter that we headed to Johasnnesburg. The city has\
  \ many historical spots and one definitely worth a visit is the Aparteid Museum.\
  \ Despite all the many other activities that South Africa can offer we still really\
  \ wanted to go to a safari and so we did. We booked a two day trip in Kruger's National\
  \ Park and it was incredible. I felt like I was inside a Lion King movie for real.\
  \ Nature there is different from anything that you ever saw and being that close\
  \ to those gigantic animals was a one in a lifetime experience.\n\nIn conclusion\
  \ I believe that all destinations have something to offer and are worth your while,\
  \ you just have to apropriate travel plan. A leap into the unkown can provide the\
  \ most unexpected and exciting adventures of all times."
