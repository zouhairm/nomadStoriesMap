Text: "It\u2019s hard to describe the feeling of epiphany, but when it comes, it was\
  \ pure bliss. It\u2019s a sudden rush of excitement and joy. Suddenly, everything\
  \ seems clear. The last time I had a great epiphany was last summer.\n\nMy mom loves\
  \ travelling and she could spend the last penny for it. So when an opportunity to\
  \ Europe came up, by no time we had already booked our tickets, packed our bags,\
  \ and grabbed a taxi to the airport. We even left our dad because he couldn't leave\
  \ his work. It took us hours to get there and more hours on the transit. We jumped\
  \ from town to town, simply enjoying ourselves. Eating every delicacy, visiting\
  \ every sites, and spent our time simply experiencing the local culture that they\
  \ could offer. We even met someone who was kind enough to show us around his town.\
  \ All of this was new and exciting. However, there was one place I could never forget\
  \ and that place was in Switzerland.\n\nMy expectation of Switzerland was a crowded\
  \ yet this exclusive town full of sophisticated elitists wearing red bottoms and\
  \ driving sports car and honestly, I never imagined it to be so peaceful. In fact,\
  \ cars were hard to find. The people were humble and everything seemed modest. but\
  \ while it all looked classy, there was nothing too extravagant.\n\nOn the last\
  \ day,  we wanted to go around the town one last time. We were just passing by when\
  \ something caught my mother's eye. There, in a park, white tents everywhere, people\
  \ were bringing their kids, families, and even their dogs to what seemed to be a\
  \ fair. There were food vendors, people selling vintage clothing, and what intrigued\
  \ me the most was that there were antiques ranging from painting to 60-90's toys.\
  \ They were unique and different. If my father was there, he would have been ecstatic.\
  \ I could see the history of this town and go through what it had gone through over\
  \ the years. The story of the living and maybe even the dead residents resonated\
  \ through their photos and writings. I saw an elder wearing hat and long coat smiled\
  \ when he came across old CDs while his granddaughter was whining because she wanted\
  \ to get some ice cream. My mom tried on an old leather jacket from Versace and\
  \ all I could think of was how this jacket was worn by a proud owner at the time.\
  \ I was in awe. \n\nAnd while my mom wander through clothes and shoes, I wander\
  \ through time."
