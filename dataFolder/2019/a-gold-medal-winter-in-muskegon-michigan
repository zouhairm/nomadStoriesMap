Text: "If you\u2019ve ever watched the Winter Olympics from the comfort of your couch,\
  \ judging athletes with your hand in a bag of potato chips, then you and I could\
  \ probably be friends. So I was as surprised as anyone to find myself lying horizontally\
  \ on a luge, fingers gripping the frozen push handles, and ready to slide down a\
  \ track made entirely from ice. \n\nJust 30 minutes outside of Grand Rapids, Michigan,\
  \ is the Muskegon Winter Sports Complex. It\u2019s home to ice skating rinks, a\
  \ fun sledding hill popular with families, and the ultimate daredevil attraction:\
  \ An ice luge. There are only a handful of ice luges in the United States, and Muskegon\
  \ boasts one of the few that welcomes the public to try it out. For a few weekends\
  \ each winter, you can sign up, pay a $49 fee and get a few hours of ice luging\
  \ practice.\n\nThe whole experience is daunting, right from the moment you step\
  \ into the heated yurt adjacent to the track and get asked for proof of health insurance.\
  \ That was when I realized that perhaps this was a little more intense than I was\
  \ expecting. I was told to grab a helmet and some arm pads, and I got ready for\
  \ what I assumed would be a full lesson with plenty of safety tips. Instead, a 13-year-old\
  \ boy ran us through the basics of steering with our feet. In minutes, we were grabbing\
  \ sleds out in the snow and climbing three flights of stairs to the top of the track.\n\
  \nThe first brave soul asked, while at the top of the icy track, \u201CWait - how\
  \ do I see if I have to lie flat on the luge?\u201D The response? A comforting,\
  \ \u201CYou can\u2019t see. You\u2019ll start to learn the turns\u2026eventually.\u201D\
  \n\nOnce it was my go, I feigned a coolness that matched the subzero temperatures\
  \ of Michigan in February. A firm push and I was away! Although top speeds that\
  \ day were apparently about 25 miles per hour, it felt much, much faster. The sides\
  \ of the wooden track sped past the sides of my face, and on the first big turn\
  \ my luge lifted up and then slid across with a whack to the other side of the track.\
  \ As I neared the finish, I heard a concerned voice yelling, \u201CNo, no! You look\
  \ like a ping pong ball!\u201D \n\nI have bruises from that first run down the ice\
  \ luge, and I still don\u2019t know if it was fun or terrifying. What I do know\
  \ is that I went down the luge four more times that day, and I\u2019ve got it marked\
  \ on my calendar for next year. \n\nAn added bonus? The end of each luging sessions\
  \ ends with a cheesy and still somehow nerve-wracking awards ceremony - complete\
  \ with bronze, silver and gold medals for the fastest lugs runs from the day. \n\
  \nThe Muskegon Winter Sports Complex is within a two-minute walk of the Muskegon\
  \ State Park, which has well-equipped and heated cabins for rent. Although the shores\
  \ of Lake Michigan are packed in the summer, experiencing the snow-covered dunes\
  \ in the solitude of winter is far more memorable. Plus, the stillness of the empty\
  \ lakeshore is the ideal way to decompress after the adrenaline-including afternoon\
  \ of ice-luging!"
