Text: "After all of my nuclear family died, only traveling made sense. I planned a\
  \ safari in the Okavango Delta near Maun Botswana, one of the premiere locations\
  \ for viewing Africa\u2019s majestic animals. Before safari, my partner and I cared\
  \ for our safari agent\u2019s (Glen), house and pets for three weeks. With Glen\u2019\
  s loaned car, we lunched with his friends and attended community celebrations. But\
  \ it was the benefits of my volunteer work at the rape crisis center, initiated\
  \ by Glen, that was the most surprising. Twelve hours taught me far more than all\
  \ my previous study about Botswana and I was set for a deeper safari experience\
  \ and though I didn\u2019t know it at the time, a new future.  \n\tBotswana is a\
  \ matrilineal culture, meaning that wealth is passed down through the mothers\u2019\
  \ line. I learned about divorce, adoption, death and inheritance practices by listening\
  \ to the counselors\u2019 stories so we could better categorize them for data tracking.\
  \ The government gives every citizen a plot of land, something possible because\
  \ diamonds were discovered in 1967. Botswana is now one of the most financially\
  \ and politically stable countries in developing Africa. I felt the peace and acceptance\
  \ but it wasn\u2019t until talking with the counselors that I understood why.  \n\
  \t My learning carried over into safari. For five jam-packed days, we were the only\
  \ guests in Lucky\u2019s Four Runner.  Lucky, owner of \u201CGifts of the Kalahari\u201D\
  , is a gentle spirit with a twinkle in his deep brown eyes that invited us into\
  \ his bottomless love of the delta. And skilled! His jeep is first at most leopard\
  \ sightings. Each day, we would rise before dawn, gobble breakfast and leap into\
  \ the jeep for sunrise viewing. Graceful long-necked giraffe silhouetted against\
  \ the rising sun, troops of baboons swinging from branches and stealing fruit, the\
  \ skillful leap of gazelles as they kick back their legs almost to a handstand in\
  \ a karate-like move -- I imagined them working out to survive a lion charge. With\
  \ unlimited access to Lucky and his deep reverential knowledge of the entire ecosystem,\
  \ we became friends. I learned Setswana from the \u201Cwalkie walkie,\u201D the\
  \ radio used by all guides, and that many of the white guides refuse to share tracking\
  \ information with African guides.   \nFor five days, we lived in an eight-foot\
  \ square tent with adjoining smaller open-air bathroom. We slept on army cots, and\
  \ used the pit toilet dug for us by two camp hands. Revenge, the camp chef, made\
  \ lavish four-course meals over a wood fire and half smiled as she told of her 18-month\
  \ old child at home with her father. Women all over Africa tell of hiding money\
  \ from their male partners, in Botswana\u2019s case, to protect inheritance but\
  \ for others, to keep the men from drinking all the family\u2019s income come payday.\
  \ Before bed, heated water was delivered to fill our bucket shower. Warm water rinsing\
  \ off road dust beneath endless twinkling stars might be too rustic for some, but\
  \ for me -- heaven. Frequent footfalls, guttural grunts, and heavy heaving breaths\
  \ often punctuated the night, but with the flaps on the tent firmly closed, we knew\
  \ only come morning which animals had passed by in the night. I can now recognize\
  \ the throaty call of lions and identify elephant, hippos and zebra by their footprints\
  \ and scat, but somehow, I never stopped to consider why the small kerosene lantern\
  \ placed outside our tent had kept the carnivores from attacking us. \n\tVolunteering\
  \ in Botswana inspired me to take a 2-month service trip to Uganda and Kenya to\
  \ use my leadership skills to benefit organizations in the developing world. I provided\
  \ management and fundraising consultation plus staff and board development for a\
  \ medical program in Uganda and two orphanages in Kenya. The immediacy of loss is\
  \ passing and I\u2019m finding my footing in life again. In Botswana, I opened the\
  \ door to marry service and travel. In Uganda and Kenya, I learned that my skills\
  \ align best with a medium-sized organization, to preplan activities and that having\
  \ control of my living situation is critical.  And, I also witnessed thirty lions\
  \ on safari in the Maasi Mara in Kenya."
