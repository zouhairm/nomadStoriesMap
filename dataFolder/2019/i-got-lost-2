Text: "She was right in front of my eyes.Her soft skin touching my feat and her dark\
  \ blue eyes looking at me.I could feel a connection;a connection with an innocent\
  \ creature i had never seen before.I wanted to talk to her,to listen to her story\
  \ and to hold her in my hands.However,with a wave of fast-moving water she was driven\
  \ away from me.I could not let her go so i decided to follow her.This was not part\
  \ of my plan on the trip but i told the jeep driver to start the jeep and follow\
  \ the road by the running water.The more and more I went ahead I realized that i\
  \ had left my friend and her world far below.I asked the driver to stop.I jumped\
  \ out of the jeep and standing by the roadside I had a look at the water running\
  \ below.Where was it going?It was the water that took my friend with it.Maybe this\
  \ water led to her home.In the blink of an eye i made a plan to explore my friend\u2019\
  s world.The place was new for me so i asked the jeep driver if he could help me\
  \ find a diving spot.The next day he took me to that spot.I was assigned a trainer\
  \ and my training began.When my trainer asked me the reason for diving,all I could\
  \ say was that I want to see my friend\u2019s world.After a day or two of training\
  \ I was ready to dive under the supervision of my trainer.I was very excited.Being\
  \ a nomad in the true sense,I have travelled a lot of places on earth.From high\
  \ snowy mountains to lush green fields and sandy dry deserts,my thirst for travelling\
  \ has never been quenched.However,this was something new.For the first time,I was\
  \ going into the world of unknown:under the water.I was about to jump into the river\
  \ with the hope that I could see my innocent friend once again.I closed my eyes\
  \ and jumped.In a second the I hit the water and went straight down.Now it was time\
  \ to open my eyes.She was in front of my very eyes.I dont know if she was the same\
  \ fish or not.All I knew that it was a new world.The fish turned and started swimming\
  \ away and i started following her.It was all dark with some sun rays piercing into\
  \ the deep water.There were so many uniques creatures:small big all of them.Their\
  \ were plants or something green atleast.I was actually lost in the beauty of the\
  \ place.It was quite mesmerising.The water touching my face.I had forgotten that\
  \ I was a human being.I thought I was a fish too.I had no worries in my life.No\
  \ violence no failures no suffering.All there was silence:a deafening silence.Now\
  \ I know why my friend was so innocent.I could have spent my whole life there when\
  \ my trainer asked me to move up.I just bade goodbye to the beautiful world with\
  \ the promise that I will be back soon.And I was confident making this promise because\
  \ I am a traveller and a traveller can only promise of coming back and never staying\
  \ at one place.I started this trip as an ordinary trip to a new place but I did\
  \ not know this would become an experience of a lifetime for me. And this story\
  \ cannot end without thanking Mustafa,my jeep driver,who took me to the diving spot.But\
  \ the story does not end here.My next destination is K-2 peak climbing.I\u2019ll\
  \ be embarking on the journey soon so that i can return to my friend deep into the\
  \ water soon."
