Text: "You lean on the pillar under the overpass, watching the crowd moving slowly\
  \ over the distant pier. The sunset reflects everyone into a shadow.\n\nWhat a glorious\
  \ sunny day. You think of the golden gleam on the eaves of the Grand Palace, which\
  \ you can't tell from the same dazzling sunlight \u2014\u2014 Have these people\
  \ seen it? Do they enjoy that magnificence? You have no ideas, actually you didn't\
  \ step in there at all; you just walked around the exterior wall, by the traffic,\
  \ on anonymous roads. You are always more easily touched by those small fragile\
  \ things; famous attractions like the Grand Palace will confuse you like, where\
  \ should you start to explore.\n\nThe crowd are getting closer. You see someone\
  \ holding a familiar bag of small pineapple. Yours have already been in the stomach,\
  \ while his still leaves half. The juice is shaking in the bag; chatting with friends,\
  \ he can't hear those little brats keep shouting \"Please eat me!\" Well, sounds\
  \ like your stomach's words. Is your friend working overtime tonight? You turn to\
  \ another side, where stands a streetlamp with gentle glow.\n\nWhy did you come\
  \ here? Why did such a dislike-the-crowd you go to a typical tourist attraction\
  \ like the Old City? As a future anthropologist, don't you always believe wandering\
  \ in different places helps little about deep understanding of the world? You criticize\
  \ the gaze of tourists, avoid catching fragments or being opinionated to treat everything\
  \ as symbols; aren't those roads with fewer people certain symbols? Didn't you wait\
  \ for ten minutes at a bus stop just to seize a perfect \"wait\" moment?\n\nYou\
  \ recall your own field work, six months in a serene valley. From total strangers\
  \ to intimate friends, you built deep connections with local people even every tree\
  \ and flower there; they all became a part of you. During that time, you rarely\
  \ thought of the camera or pen to record anything consciously; you just became a\
  \ part of there too, at extreme ease. You even felt improper when you worked on\
  \ your dissertation, which you thought was a kind of disrespect. How do you give\
  \ up to make that connection now? Because you just stay here for a few days?\n\n\
  The sky is already dark, oozing coolness. People are surging into the subway and\
  \ being transported to different nests. Having Stood for quite a long time, you\
  \ throw the bag on the ground and sit cross-legged beside it. Then you find there\
  \ are two guys opposite you with a wooden box and a musical instrument, something\
  \ like a Guzheng, or a dulcimer; anyway, a kind of traditional thing. \n\nThe short\
  \ one is sitting on the ground and the tall on the box. They smile at each other\
  \ and the melody flows. Familiar American pop songs, but adapted to their own version;\
  \ love songs can also be beaming. You sit exactly across from them, shaking your\
  \ head and body for five or six songs. Immersed in such great pleasure, you get\
  \ up and put all your change into the cloth bag in front of them. After another\
  \ song, you ask them what the instrument is; they look at you and smile embarrassedly,then\
  \ you know they can't speak English. It's OK, you smile back, and sit beside them\
  \ for more melody.\n\nOf course they don't mind; after some water, they restart\
  \ their performance. There are fewer people under the overpass, but their passion\
  \ become more and more soaring. You can feel the joy of their drumbeats is constantly\
  \ accumulating, so that the guy who beats the box suddenly stands up and invites\
  \ his heels to join the tempo together. How can you still sit there? You learned\
  \ dance from a little girl! You begin to dance around them. Familiar melodies make\
  \ the rhythm stand out; all of you dance to it; your steps ripple the night, with\
  \ great delight.\n\nThe phone rings in the bag; your friend's message says she would\
  \ arrive soon. But she may find that there's no you or them anymore, just the joy\
  \ of dance glitters with the moonlight."
