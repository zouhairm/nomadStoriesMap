Text: "Nothing quite compares to travelling by train in India, an experience that\
  \ engenders wonder, nervous anticipation and heady exhilaration in equal measure.\
  \ Today (2/03/2018) marks the first day of travelling by train alone in India! I\
  \ must say, it was quite an experience. I got a ticket to Kadur and boarded the\
  \ train \u202Aat 12:30pm\u202C. My friend, Aashritha had come to the station and\
  \ was there till the train departed. Just as the train slowly started moving, she\
  \ luckily found out I had to change trains in between the journey and informed me\
  \ immediately that I had to change it in a place called \u201CChilajur\u201D. \n\
  I did manage to get my way through but I will admit there is much scope for improvement\
  \ \u2013 a better website, cleaner loos (and a population that is more educated\
  \ about hygiene), cleaner stations, safety measures, and a plethora of other things.\
  \ But the Indian Railways definitely has a charm of its own, one that I find irresistible\
  \ and I am certain I will keep going back.\_I feel a strong connection with India\
  \ while I travel by train \u2013 perhaps because of the people I meet as native\u2019\
  \ places are discussed, common ground is discovered, and everybody relaxes once\
  \ the initial ice is broken or the glimpses of seemingly impenetrable acres of land.\
  \ Perhaps because of the station vendors selling food at the window.\nPerhaps it\u2019\
  s because of station names that surprise me every time I find one that I hadn\u2019\
  t heard of before. Perhaps it\u2019s the impulsive and sudden kindness of strangers.\
  \ Perhaps it\u2019s the rich landscape that ranges from dry deserts to lush green\
  \ hills or perhaps it\u2019s also the reality check and the questions that come\
  \ with witnessing beautiful fields lead into dirty, trash-strewn town outskirts.\n\
  All in all, I feel more grounded when I travel by train. I can\u2019t say the same\
  \ about air travel haha. Cannot wait what my next experience on an Indian railway\
  \ has for me."
