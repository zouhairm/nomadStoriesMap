Text: "An Airbus plane, two stories high, three aisles wide. A flight attendant with\
  \ a blonde ponytail struts by, her red polished hands running along the overhead\
  \ compartments. The safety video drones on in the background. The voice sounds grainy,\
  \ an effect caused by the low quality speakers the plane is equipped with. The plane\
  \ rumbles. Its gears grind and its engine purrs, all in prep for the nine-hour flight\
  \ to Toulouse.\n\nThe plane begins to move towards the runway, and I realize with\
  \ surprise that I have hit the jackpot of oversea flights: the seat next to me is\
  \ empty.\n\nAn empty seat.\n\nThe luxury of an empty seat on a trans-Atlantic flight\
  \ surpasses any first class benefit. There\u2019s the added element of surprise\
  \ that comes with the discovery, which tastes just as sweet as any complimentary\
  \ mimosa.\n\nThroughout the flight, the things that were once stuffed under the\
  \ seat in front of me found themselves on the chair next to me. First, my headphones.\
  \ Then, a blanket. Then, The Stranger by Albert Camus. Finally, I succumbed to watching\
  \ Eat Pray Love via Lufthansa\u2019s complimentary movies as I waited for the melatonin\
  \ to kick in.\n\nEven though I had brought 500 distractions along, nothing brought\
  \ me as much ease as the adjacent empty. No polite hellos, no forced conversations.\
  \ Or worse, none of that stiff silence that lasts for nine hours while each passenger\
  \ tries to ignore the other\u2019s existence.\n\nNope. Just an empty seat.\n\nAs\
  \ the nine hours passed, I didn\u2019t sleep a wink. My mind flashed back to my\
  \ last flight abroad \u2014 Kristen, a blue-eyed bartender from Austin, and I had\
  \ stayed up all night, giggling over glasses of wine, discussing W.B. Yates and\
  \ theories of the universe. Her fianc\xE9 slept next to her, mouth agape, complimentary\
  \ eye mask sliding down the side of his cheek. Kristen and I exchanged our life\
  \ stories with each other, sharing our greatest fears and how they had made us great.\n\
  \nThere\u2019s something sacred about the conversations that take place on flights.\
  \ The comfort of opening up to a stranger, the secureness in knowing you might never\
  \ see them again, the safety you feel while going 550 mph some 35,000 feet above\
  \ the Atlantic Ocean. A snippet of yourself boiled down into nine hours, given more\
  \ freely to this person than to most people you interact with daily. \n\nThis is\
  \ one of the beauties of traveling: immediacy and intimacy. \n\nThere\u2019s a certain\
  \ element of immediacy in traveling, in needing to do exactly what you wish to do\
  \ as soon as you wish to do it (because that chance can disappear faster than the\
  \ flight attendant\u2019s smile when you ask for a snack during non-snack times).\
  \ There\u2019s a certain level of intimacy, of empathetic understanding found in\
  \ a person who feels familiar in such an unfamiliar place. \n\nBut on this Lufthansa\
  \ flight #447 to Toulouse, there was none of that. The seat next to me was empty,\
  \ asking me to fare my own way through these next six months. Immediate intimacy\
  \ was not found, and the seat next to me asked me to find it within myself: to spill\
  \ my books and headphones over into that seat and fill it with my own self rather\
  \ than search for something else to comfort me. \n\nThe seat next to me asked me\
  \ to take these nine hours to reflect, or should I say, \u201Cpre-flect,\u201D over\
  \ the journey that lay ahead. These six months in Toulouse, although accompanied\
  \ by a cohort of students all seeking study abroad experiences, although bound to\
  \ be filled with blissed and blessed memories, although a time for me to grow and\
  \ expand beyond limitations I don\u2019t even know exist, will be a solitary sojourn.\
  \ An inner odyssey.\n\nAnd that is what the empty seat next to me whispered in my\
  \ ear the entire flight. I found comfort in the space I was gifted with to expand.\
  \ I slid my eye mask over my face, leaned back in my aisle seat, and breathed out\
  \ a sigh that probably lasted longer than my six months in Toulouse."
