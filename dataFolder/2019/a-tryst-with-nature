Text: "Lombok. It was quite a journey I had there. I still remember the excitement\
  \ then the anguish of missing the flight. The dilemma whether to go or not. The\
  \ impulse to swipe my credit card to buy the next flight ticket. The solace when\
  \ I finally stepped out from the plane to a waiting tour guide.\nMy adventure began.\
  \ First stop, an island named Gili Trawangan. Going with a boat, it was riding through\
  \ the wave with the blue sky as background. The water sometimes touch my arm as\
  \ if she wanted to welcome me. Nearing the side of the island, the boat stopped\
  \ and I had to walk through the water to get there. Followed by the long bike riding\
  \ through the sand to Ombak Sunset, the villa the company booked for this outing.\
  \ It means \u201CSunset Wave\u201D. It was a perfect hideaway. Lush green trees\
  \ inside the complex and a white sand beach in front. With the sun started to set\
  \ down bringing the orange glow to life. A treat to my sore eyes. A friend came\
  \ by and took me to my designated villa. \nIts front occupied with statue and rattan\
  \ sofa greeted me. Inside it was spacious with a king\u2019s bed in one side and\
  \ sitting room then there was this door at the back. Never I imagined it led to\
  \ an open bathroom. Clustered by wall and trees, there was a bamboo shower in the\
  \ left and toilet at the right with a small garden patch in the middle. Panic came\
  \ to me thinking of taking a bath or peeing in the night. Surrounded by the blackness,\
  \ the sound of crickets and night creatures, the feeling that something lurking\
  \ in the tree above. I casted my eyes downright to the floor rushing towards the\
  \ room. Safe at last.\nMorning came. Time to head off to another place. Second stop,\
  \ Pantai Kuta Lombok. Located in Central Lombok, it is a mixed of beaches and hills.\
  \ With a friend, we decided to rent a motorbike to explore the beaches. The road\
  \ was pretty good. Bottled in my memory was the view; it seems like we were riding\
  \ to a clear blue ocean. Time seemed to still and in a sudden I saw black and a\
  \ scorching pain in my arm and knee. I was blank in a moment until someone talked\
  \ to me and helped me to stand. I needed time to understand what happened. It turned\
  \ out that my friend driving the bike lost its balance and we felt. We had an intimate\
  \ encounters with the asphalt. I felt that life could be snatched away quickly.\
  \ It was the power of nature. We were lucky to escape with only bruises and there\
  \ were no other vehicles. After thanking the villagers, we continued the journey."
