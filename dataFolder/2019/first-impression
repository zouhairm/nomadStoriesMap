Text: "I wake up in the morning on the 2 February. Warm and sunny weather makes me\
  \ happy. It is our first day in Hong Kong. My boyfriend Nikita and me are going\
  \ to Victoria peak. We have fast breakfast so that to start observing as soon as\
  \ possible. \nThe day is supposed to be long and unforgettable. There is a big line\
  \ on the legendary tram, that leads to peak. I watch people around me. I hear different\
  \ languages. People from all over the world want to look at Hong Kong from the bird\u2019\
  s eye view. The way is exciting. Old tram goes cheerfully at so steep angle, that\
  \ it seems we can roll back. Hong Kong shows all the beauty from the observation\
  \ deck. I can not see any space between these high buildings. It is actually stone\
  \ jungle. While we are picking the best spot for a photo, a man is coming to us.\
  \ He asks if we don't mind to take a picture of him. He is very polite. His gray\
  \ hair and open look strike my eyes. \nThe man says with proud: \"I am from New\
  \ York City\". I do not usually meet people who loves hometown as strong as he does.\
  \ I am pleased to talk to him about Russia and USA, Hong Kong. It is great, that\
  \ americans are easy to communicate. We agree that Hong Kong is \"asian New York\"\
  . Nikita and me offer the man to travel to Moscow or Saint Petersburg.He says unexpectedly:\
  \ \"I wonder if it is safely in Russia\". I am shocked. It is funny and shameful.\
  \ We are trying to persuade him that our country is safe, especially for tourists.\
  \ \"Russians are very hospitable. You will fall in love with our culture\". We say\
  \ good bye to each other. However this silly feeling of disappointment is still\
  \ with me. Why does he think in this way? Some of Russians consider the USA is insecure.\
  \ Again I am glad I have been to America and I am upset these countries have not\
  \ cordial relationships.\nWe walk down to the city. A path is winding and steep.\
  \ Our legs are bound out of habit. But we are not in a hurry, observing marvelous\
  \ plants with giant leaves and thorns. While I am hanging on my boyfriend, hoping\
  \ he can share my fatigue, students are running by. Maybee it is PT class. I remember\
  \ we skied in the forest in a winter time. The way seems endless. New level appears\
  \ suddenly, when we think it is finish. Then I understand that Hong Kong is arranged\
  \ unique. Districts are located on the different height levels. A street always\
  \ goes up or down. \nWe enter a park and see lemurs. We have found out that there\
  \ is a free zoo here. I am surprised. No crowd. People are walking around calmly.\
  \ They used to see all these animals and birds. This tropical garden is right in\
  \ the center of city. You can come and take a break from the noise, enjoy the atmosphere.\
  \ It is exotic for Russians. \nWalked enough we come to busy street. I have heard\
  \ before that some Michelin restaurants for affordable prices are here. We want\
  \ to try something racy. We are in \u201CDim Dim Sum\u201D. In my mind Michelin\
  \ restaurant is luxury place with superior service. Here the hall is small. Adjacent\
  \ table is so close, that I can read a book, which the girl holds. To make an order\
  \ we need to mark a dish on the paper. Everybody recommends to eat here. So, quality\
  \ of food is the most important now, nothing else. The teapot stood here since we\
  \ had come. I take a sip. It should be tea, but smells like hot water with soil.\
  \ I see people drink it with pleasure. As accepted in China every dish goes with\
  \ soy sauce. Our dumplings with shrimp and chiken and rice balls with beef and vegetables\
  \ are really delicious. \nWe go to the hotel by double-decker bus. Our seats are\
  \ by the window and we have evening tour. High buildings, harbor, little cafes,\
  \ different people are everywhere. Citizens hurry on their business."
