Text: "\u201CHey!\u201D It was her message after a long period of almost a month.\n\
  \u201CHey dear! What\u2019s up?\u201D I rushed my fingers over my phone\u2019s screen\
  \ and typed the words, but soon stopped to reply immediately. Because our relation\
  \ was sadly not that way frankly\u2014I had to hold my self-esteem by replying not\
  \ so instantly; I had to show her I was not all the way waiting for just her texts\
  \ while I was. My tongue could never express my feeling for Mahrukh. \n\u201CAll\
  \ good.\u201D She replied when I sent my text after a while. \u201CGet your guitar\
  \ in tune and make your team ready for a grand performance. See you in the department\
  \ tomorrow! Bye!\u201D A number of emoji showed she was excited.\n\u201CI didn\u2019\
  t get it. What performance about are you talking?\u201D \nBut the double grey tick\
  \ never turned blue until tomorrow. By the next morning, I hanged my guitar backside\
  \ my shoulder and made my way towards university excitedly; I was expecting something\
  \ exceptional. Mahrukh greeted me in front of our classroom along her friends. On\
  \ the spot, I was informed Islamia College University Peshawar had to participate\
  \ in several competitions, which included Battle of the Bands, Painting, cinematography\
  \ etc. in a seminar held at Islamabad, and I had to represent my university playing\
  \ music. Knowing my position, I asked about the date when the competitions were\
  \ holding? And I flabbergasted knowing that those just two days after that day.\
  \ \nI thought were they mad to have asked me to jam in just a time of two days for\
  \ a competition at the country level, while I had not touched any instrument since\
  \ our last welcome party, and also, I had no team ready at all then, but I said\
  \ I was ready. That was ever first time Mahrukh had asked me for collaboration;\
  \ I could simply not refuse. \nRight, that day, I missed all my classes to gather\
  \ players; and hardly found three guys to have shared the band. Aqsa, luckily very\
  \ phenomenal at drums, and the rest two; Shehzad and Ahmad were just into music,\
  \ Vocalist and Rababist respectively. While I, being the leader, decided to share\
  \ the stage with them as a composer, lyricist, lead guitarist and backing vocalist.\
  \ Though the team members were not much seasoned, and so the performance was wholly\
  \ dependent on me and the drummer Aqsa. The rest of two were just made understood\
  \ to play just few particular keys, otherwise, they would spoil the song; and so,\
  \ the song was kept simple and short for the purpose. And yes, every band had to\
  \ play their original songs. \nEarly in the morning, including all the girls and\
  \ boys we were 18, got onto the bus to leave for Islamabad on the given date. Moving\
  \ on M1 towards Islamabad, guys played music in the bus, danced, cried; simply enjoyed\
  \ the life on its peak.\n\u201CYou didn\u2019t sing?\u201D She asked me when I finally\
  \ made it possible to have asked her to sit beside her if she\u2019d not mind. I\
  \ found her concern a sweet one, she wasn\u2019t a self-oriented girl as I had expected,\
  \ but much lovely and expressive. Her concern felt me something melted in my chest.\
  \ \nI answered I was not good at singing and my voice was not that good\u2014like\
  \ those who have their heart broken. Being so smart of her, she acquired was my\
  \ heart yet not broken? With her question, my years fell red and my voice obstructed\
  \ in my throat. I smilingly answered that my heart might be soon broken but not\
  \ until. As at the time, I was thinking to propose her at our way back Peshawar.\
  \ And at the time, I calculated she was getting I was feeling for her. \n On the\
  \ stage, we first warmed up for a minute and then a mediator announced that our\
  \ time was started. The crowd clapped and cried for us while I was anxious for getting\
  \ start. In a moment, as our Rababist just hit the first string, a sort of current\
  \ blew in my head; he was hitting wrong notes I found, but the crowed was yet waiting\
  \ for something amazing. In another moment, the crowd and juries completely disappointed\
  \ when the vocalist also started singing not in a row with Rabab\u2019s notes\u2014\
  as he had no sense to get in flow with other instruments. The awkwardness was touching\
  \ heights that I suddenly came over near the vocalist and understood him a new plan\
  \ through my position\u2014I exchanged my backing vocalist role with his leading\
  \ vocalist. Our plan somehow vivified our presence on the stage, and we got a chance\
  \ to rock, and even few lines of lyrics completely distorted but could managed on\
  \ the spot. \nAt the end, our band received incredible appreciation but secured\
  \ sadly third spot\u2014as expected. But when I moved my gaze at Mahrukh during\
  \ announcement she was clapping and smilingly, and the came at my side and said\
  \ that I was better than she had expected. Those were some grateful feelings of\
  \ my life ever. \nOn the way back, being tired off, very late at night, I took a\
  \ seat next to her and pronounced her name,\u201D Mahrukh!\u201D If she was awakening.\
  \ I knew she was sleeping but she pretended she wasn\u2019t. We talked for a long\
  \ time and kept each other laughing so much, while I was much hopeful. \n\u201C\
  I want to tell you something... before I go backseat.\u201D I asked her reluctantly\
  \ and she presumed, \u201CYes! Please!\u201D\n\u201CI love you, I love you so much!\u201D\
  \ I said heartedly, but she excused she was already committed to someone else. I\
  \ was a nice guy\u2014that\u2019s it\u2014she said, while she\u2019d loved to stay\
  \ by me, but she couldn\u2019t. I made an intelligent nod and stood to step back.\
  \ \n\u201CHey!\u201D She addressed me with a lovely concern as I got off. \u201C\
  I hope you win the next music competition.\u201D \nPerhaps, she had listened the\
  \ voice of my heart breaking."
