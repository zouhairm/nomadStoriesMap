Text: I started alone from Trichy,  Tamilnadu, India to New Delhi, India. It was a
  day long travel in train. First I took a train from trichy to chennai and then from
  chennai to Delhi. Before I reach Delhi I enquired few details regarding the cheapest
  stay in the Delhi through online, and found one ideal place " youth hostel association
  of India" - YHAI. As soon as I got down in the H. Nisamubdin railway station I reached
  to the nearby metro station and headed towards YHAI. I took a sharing dormantry,
  I relaxed for few hours and then went out for dinner. And collected few details
  of local sight seeing and the timing to visit those places. In 3 days I completely
  finished my local sight seeing by moving around in rickshaw and local metro. All
  the delhiliet was wonderful to hang on. It was a wonderful to travel around Delhi.
  Then I planned to go to Rishikesh to enjoy the adventure activities. I made a single
  day trip to Rishikesh. Started the on late night and reached next day early morning.
  There are lots of activities going on in the river bank sides. I gave a try in river
  rafting, para jumping, bunji jumping, and had good tasty food. And visited the temple
  by evening and started back at night. Reached next day morning to Delhi. And on
  the same day I had a return train to  chennai and then from chennai to trichy my
  home town. I started this trip with lot of fear and confusions. But at the end of
  the trip I was feeling so good. Am now brave and fearless. To explore the city in
  the late evening was little fear full but it was an amazing experience. To have
  the view. It was an wonderful trip in my life. First ever solo trip.
