Text: "I walked in with my huge 55-liter backpack, my day pack in front, and a ukulele\
  \ by my side. After my hour-long journey from the airport to the house and my 12-hour\
  \ trip between Florida and Portland, I finally arrived at the place I would call\
  \ 'home' for the next three weeks. They were about to eat dinner and I was invited\
  \ to the table. Trying to deal with the butterflies in my stomach, I talked a lot\
  \ and tried to get everyone to talk \u2013 my defense mechanism for when I feel\
  \ uncomfortable. Dinner was pleasant and fulfilling but nothing could have prepared\
  \ me for all the laughter, sad stories, and good food we would make and share around\
  \ that table. \n    Arriving at a new destination feels like the moment a plane\
  \ takes off. Taxing in the runaway is when you decide to go and start preparing.\
  \ Then the pilot aligns the metal giant with the runaway marks and presses the gas\
  \ to give it speed. That's when you're actually embarking on the adventure. You\
  \ pack your bags, go to the airport, and get to your destination. As the plane starts\
  \ gaining velocity, it's exhilarating to feel your body adjusting to the abrupt\
  \ change while your mind tries guessing the exact moment the landing gear will leave\
  \ the ground. That pinch in the stomach when you realize the ground is not supporting\
  \ you anymore parallels to the moment you have just arrived somewhere new. The first\
  \ impression, your tourist eyes in foreign lands, and the first interaction with\
  \ the locals. That's when your body feels the change in pressure and tries to adjust\
  \ to it both in the airplane and at the start of your new adventure.\n    Portland\
  \ was the pinch in the stomach I was waiting on for months. I went there to stay\
  \ in what's called an \u201Cintentional community.\u201D I had no idea what that\
  \ meant but I didn't question it as they would provide me a place to stay and food\
  \ in exchange for a few hours of work a day. When I decided to take off for 4 months\
  \ without much money, I knew I had to adjust to whatever came my way. And on my\
  \ way came the Bremen House. Similarly to the tale of a donkey that decides to become\
  \ a town musician and picks up other unlikely musicians along the way, the Bremen\
  \ House was a safe haven to misfits and a place of intersection where everybody\
  \ was welcome. Since the first wall I painted in the basement, I felt physically\
  \ connected to the house. I've lived in many places but I've never felt connected\
  \ to the brick and mortar on a spiritual level. \n    Living in an intentional community\
  \ meant that instead of just paying rent, having your labeled shelf in the fridge\
  \ and cooking for one, we shared all the food around, cooked for the whole house,\
  \ and shared our joys and struggles with one another. Even though I only stayed\
  \ there for three weeks, I got to connect to \"strangers\" in a way that had never\
  \ happened to me. This experience brings me back to the moment of takeoff. That\
  \ sweet spot between ground and air when your brain hasn't fully adjusted and you\
  \ feel uncertain. Despite being inside a plane hundreds of times, every time it\
  \ starts gaining speed I like to close my eyes and let the experience consume me.\
  \ Portland and the Bremen House gave me the most intense and consuming feeling yet\
  \ and that's how traveling should feel every time. That's the best feeling in the\
  \ world."
