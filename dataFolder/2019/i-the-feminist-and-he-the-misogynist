Text: "Messages ping-ponged on the WhatsApp group faster than the flight of greater\
  \ flamingos we intended to shoot at BHIGWAN, India. Profound tech messages, combating\
  \ one another, over the winning combination of ISO, focal length, shutter speed\
  \ and lens. \n\nAfter waiting for over forty eight hours, I finally found a crack\
  \ when someone enquired about the mode of transport. Grabbing the opening, I tendered\
  \ my singular submission on the group, \u201CHi guys, we have not been introduced\
  \ yet. I am new to photography and birding. If it is alright, could I take one of\
  \ the front seats please? It is a long tricky dive and I am prone to travel sickness.\
  \ I am so sorry.\u201D\n\nAfter twelve hours of pin-drop-silence, our local guide\
  \ and mentor, Shamsher, responded, \u201COf course Anuradha, sit wherever.\u201D\
  \n\nThe only comforting factor was that my age, 52, wasn\u2019t an outlier in that\
  \ group of ten. The other nine (including Shamsher), aforementioned men, had been\
  \ on many such birding together. \n\nShamsher\u2019s call on the night of departure\
  \ put me on the qui vive, \u201CDon\u2019t don\u2019t pack too much. Just pack one\
  \ change and keep one extra\u2026.there will be no time for anything\u2026.and reach\
  \ the meeting point in time. 6:30 am, sharp.\u201D Rest of the conversation became\
  \ blur\u2026isn\u2019t 07:00 hours, the time printed in the itinerary?!! \n\nMy\
  \ feminist flag fluttered. It\u2019s been more than twenty years of lone battle\
  \ against the likes of him. My daughter was five when I metamorphosed to working\
  \ woman after my husband succumbed to a road accident.\n\nI finally decided I won\u2019\
  t let the bigot win and agreed to pick up Vasant (a groupie) en-route. At daggers\
  \ drawn, when Shamsher called sharp at 06:20 hours, I didn\u2019t let the opportunity\
  \ go. Wide eyed Vasant played along as I cooed, \u201CI am delayed. Really Sorry\u2026\
  will definitely start in fifteen minutes\u2026now please hang up so that I can book\
  \ Uber. Don\u2019t leave without me.\u201D\n\nPrecisely seven minutes later, the\
  \ misogynist scanned my tiny backpack and broke into a heartwarming (sic) smile,\
  \ \u201CI had started to fear it is the beginning of delays\u2026 ladies\u2026makeup\u2026\
  shakeup\u2026no?\n\n\u201CNO,\u201D I fumed as I quietly occupied the front seat.\n\
  \nIn no time, Shamsher and others got busy enjoying the trip, pulling each other\u2019\
  s leg while I sulked with my bladder threatening to burst.\nIt was just the beginning\
  \ of my woes. Looking at my camera grip, the group didn\u2019t need Sherlock Holmes\
  \ to guess my skill level...( I will hold the camera the way I want!!) \n\nSheepishly,\
  \ I unpacked my five pound tele-lens and mounted it on an archaic body that somehow\
  \ supported it. \u201CYou should buy a shoulder strap and invest in shoes\u2026\
  ,\u201D I let it pass, glad I didn\u2019t carry the bean bag my daughter lounges\
  \ on (after spending considerable time calculating that the bottom of the boat can\
  \ be adequately padded with other nine).\n\nAfternoon Sun blazed over 100 degree\
  \ Fahrenheit as the men in khaki took positions near the water body. Swallowing\
  \ my pride, I asked the one next to me, \u201CWhat should I look at?\u201D \n\n\
  Shamsher, the smug, came to my rescue. Inspecting the camera settings he beamed,\
  \ \u201Chmmm\u2026mmm\u201D and pointed the lens deep in the bush. I instantly fell\
  \ in love with the magnificent little Red Avadavat. \n\nBy evening, post a flock\
  \ of flamingos flew across the setting sun, my arms refused to lift the bulky apparatus\
  \ anymore. No endorphins rushed while my brain staged a coup. Thankfully the day\
  \ was over. \n\nWhile others animatedly shared their monitors and \u201Cooh..ed\u201D\
  \ and \u201Caah..ed\u201D, I switched off mine with overexposed, underexposed and\
  \ blurred images. \n\nThe only incentive of being the only woman in the group was\
  \ that I had the room to myself and all I wanted to do was go hide in there.\n\n\
  Shamsher, immune to excuses, insisted on attending the debriefing and urged me to\
  \ edit the exposure. Endorphins returned with a big bang as I saw the results. Though\
  \ still clumsy with constantly changing lights and required settings, my journey\
  \ had officially started.\n\n\u201CBehind the camera, there is no man or woman,\
  \ only a photographer,\u201D Shamsher added with a wink. \n\nOur mutual admiration\
  \ club is still alive and kicking."
