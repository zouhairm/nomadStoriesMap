Text: "A leap into the unknown. \n\n\tAlong a dusty and dirty road in a windy part\
  \ of the Arizona desert, I and my 8 year old son contemplated what to eat next,\
  \ what to experience next, if anything, conjured as if by magic. I looked long and\
  \ hard at his soft cherub face and knew he would eat or sleep wherever he believed\
  \ he had the best magical adventure. I learned to have the insight necessary to\
  \ walk along that dusty and windy dirt road in a happy gait that only a wandering\
  \ traveler could have. I had made a leap into the unknown world with billions of\
  \ bodies around me, all traveling. \n\n\tSo many travelers to serendipitously bump\
  \ into it is quite colorful, numbing and a bit spirited. The wind upon our faces\
  \ instead of our backs, the sun in our eyes and our bodies wanting nothing more\
  \ than rest. Me, however and my son could not rest or resist what was coming next,\
  \ our next adventure. We were traveling on foot down a dusty windy road to the next\
  \ town. We were walking inside our souls to our new understanding of the world,\
  \ even if that world was only 1,500 people big. We breathed cold winter air and\
  \ pressed forward.\n\n\tHaving made up our minds to not stop moving, we wondered\
  \ how we would be greeted and if by sundown we would have made friends or unknown\
  \ enemies? Would the small town of 1,500 greet us with words of wisdom or would\
  \ we learn harshness through differences of culture and language? You know you are\
  \ a true traveler when you have embraced both the warmth of a hug from a stranger\
  \ and the harsh sting of their culture driven actions. \n\n\tNot knowing what we\
  \ will encounter upon any travel path is just part of the education. Better than\
  \ any school program, unexpected adventures I have heard often lead to unexpected\
  \ friends, new foods and even unexpected miracles.  Me and my son of course hoped\
  \ for all of that and imagined that much of what we would see would be anything\
  \ but ordinary. Often times, we would experience not just new sounds and new tastes\
  \ but new colors as well. A sure sign of spiritual enlightenment I would imagine\
  \ from the \u201Cmanuals\u201D of so many Gurus among us. \n\n\tHaving spiritual\
  \ beliefs of an eclectic nature means that nature is a large part of sustaining\
  \ life and travels that occur inside of life. Our very breath on the dirty windy\
  \ and dusty Arizona road was filled with more than painful particles of rocks and\
  \ tumbleweeds, it was filled with the bright light of adventure! Unexpected life\
  \ happiness and unexpected changes that could be a bit painful as similar to the\
  \ growth of a small child are such a welcome to me and my son. We are a team of\
  \ wanders, lusting after new travels, unstoppable world experiences without borders\
  \ and knowing an untold amount of new friends and family awaits us. A beautiful\
  \ beach in Greece, a church in Rome or maybe wine in Spain? All we need to do is\
  \ start taking our first steps down that Arizona road. \n\nAlong a dusty and dirty\
  \ road in a windy part of the Arizona desert, I and my 8 year old son contemplated\
  \ what to eat next, if anything where to sleep next and who we would meet next.\
  \ I looked long and hard at his soft cherub face and knew he would accept and integrate\
  \ any experience wherever he believed he had the best adventure. I learned to have\
  \ the insight necessary to walk along that dusty and windy dirt road in a happy\
  \ gait that only a wandering traveler could have. I had made a leap into the unknown\
  \ world with billions of bodies around me, all traveling."
