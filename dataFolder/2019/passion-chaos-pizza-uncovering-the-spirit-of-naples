Text: "Nothing quite prepares you for Napoli. Stepping out of the metro station on\
  \ the Via Toledo, I wasn\u2019t quite sure what to expect. I came here for a long\
  \ weekend solely on the recommendation of my Italian tutor. I had heard the rumours\
  \ about Naples; chaos, rubbish piled high, petty and organised crime are some of\
  \ the stereotypes that are frequently bandied about. What I found though, was a\
  \ city of sheer unbridled energy and passion. \n\nNever have I been anywhere and\
  \ felt so energised just from the atmosphere.Walking the narrow, historic streets\
  \ was like receiving 100,000 volts of electricity through my entire sensory system.\
  \ Life in Naples is lived at 100 miles per hour with the riotous cacophony of car\
  \ horns and shouting locals as the soundtrack. The entire city is a piece of avant-garde\
  \ theatre played out on the magnificent stage of the gulf of Naples with Vesuvius\
  \ as the backdrop.\n\nI stayed in the Quartieri Spagnoli (Spanish Quarter), an area\
  \ made up of tight, warren-like streets. Standing on my balcony watching life play\
  \ out below me was a show in its own right. Vespas zipped through the claustrophobic\
  \ alleyways and washing hung between the balconies, swaying in the breeze. Groups\
  \ of young men were standing around, smoking and discussing the football, gesticulating\
  \ wildly whilst doing so and Italian mammas sat outside in the sun watching the\
  \ world go by. \n\nMy time in Naples is a collection of fantastic memories. Crossing\
  \ the road was an adventure in and of itself. Waiting at a zebra crossing here was\
  \ exactly that: waiting. You need to simply walk across the road and hope for the\
  \ best. The cars and motorbikes don\u2019t slow their approach, they just slightly\
  \ adjust their course around you. It was scary yet perversely exciting and I was\
  \ surprised at how quickly I adapted, crossing the road with reckless abandon like\
  \ a local in no time.\n\nAn unmissable Neapolitan experience is going to Sorbillo\u2019\
  s for a pizza. Naples is the birthplace of pizza and it\u2019s considered an art\
  \ form here. You cannot make a reservation so I arrived 10 minutes before the restaurant\
  \ opened and joined around 30 people waiting in the queue. More and more people\
  \ began to arrive as the sky darkened and the streetlights flickered on in the Via\
  \ dei Tribunali. A scrum of around 60 people began to cluster and push around the\
  \ door. It was carnage. The guy with the clipboard was struggling to maintain order,\
  \ shouting at people to calm down in his harsh Neapolitan accent. At one point it\
  \ seemed as if a riot was about to break out. Luckily my name was called and I slinked\
  \ inside and left the mob behind.\n\nMy fondest memory was taking the funicular\
  \ up to the Vomero district from Chiaia, the most affluent neighbourhood in Naples.\
  \ I had saved the best for last. This high up you have the most stunning views of\
  \ the city with the curving bay and the great hulk of Vesuvius spread out before\
  \ you. It is the most beautiful panorama I\u2019ve ever seen. I was tired and my\
  \ feet hurt but I stood there for a good 20 minutes, finally enjoying some peace\
  \ and quiet, realising I had loved every minute of my time here. The view punctuated\
  \ the incredible time spent in this incredible city.\n\nI had arrived in Naples\
  \ not quite sure what to expect. I was even slightly cautious because of the negative\
  \ things I had heard, but I discovered a captivating city with an unrivalled zest\
  \ for life. \n\nCome here with no planned itinerary. Put any notion of organised\
  \ crime and danger out of your mind. The only thing you really need to worry about\
  \ is the kamikaze driving. I guarantee you\u2019ll find the most exuberant, exhilarating\
  \ and exhausting city you\u2019re ever likely to visit. It is criminally under-rated\
  \ amongst the great Italian cities. For a country with an embarrassment of cultural\
  \ riches, Napoli may well be itsgreatest masterpiece."
