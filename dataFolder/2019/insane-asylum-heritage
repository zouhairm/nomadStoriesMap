Text: "I found myself in South Rio de Janeiro\u2019s countryside for a scientific\
  \ congress that I was so luckily accepted to present my work. Because I am very\
  \ underprivileged I was staying with other fifty students in a big room with only\
  \ one bathroom and no other area nor furniture. The experience wasn't being so exciting\
  \ until almost all students went to a party that only me and two other people couldn't\
  \ afford. Being young and poor we connected and decided to go out, even without\
  \ much money in our pockets. \n\nWe got out for eating A\xE7ai, a typical fruit\
  \ eaten a bit like ice cream. We went out in our pajamas and while having much fun\
  \ eaten our treats I listened some party songs coming from the building across the\
  \ street. I suggested we went there to see what was going on and so we did without\
  \ questioning much about it. It was one of the best nigths of my life - the song\
  \ came from a birthday party and everyone there welcomed us in our unusual outfits.\
  \ We danced hard with professionals, since the birthday party was at a dancing school\
  \ for one of their teachers. Afterwards we took photos in the middle of the road\
  \ and chased each other to the place we were staying. We bragged about our night\
  \ while everyone else complained their party was not fun.\n\nWe slept but the day\
  \ to come reserved even more adventures.\n\nSpontaneously we decided to investigate\
  \ the University campus and suddenly we were at the medicine building. I don\u2019\
  t know how my friend (made in the night before) knew anything but he said we should\
  \ see the corpses there. I hesitated a lot but eventually got in. A guy that didn\u2019\
  t seemed to care much gave us gloves and went getting some huge boxes with a white\
  \ old fabric above it. When he uncovered it we saw parts of bodies, skulls and fetus.\
  \ I was terrorized. I kept thinking on the mom that never saw her baby grew, what\
  \ that man was like, how long they were there, why these particular people did to\
  \ end up in such place. So I asked the inexpressive guy about the bodies' origin\
  \ and what was my shock when he told \u201CThere was an insane asylum in the 80\u2019\
  s at the hill top and when the patients died they ended up here. But since the asylum\
  \ closed we use the same bones ever since\u201D. He said that so naturally and with\
  \ quite a disappointed tone for not having more of those bones that I was just petrified\
  \ for a few seconds thinking on how people can be apathetic.\n\nI couldn't eat after\
  \ what I heard and went getting the bus feeling dizzy, shameful and guilty for compacted\
  \ with that.\n\nExactly two months afterwards I was hospitalized at a psychiatric\
  \ ward because of depression. I was in such a bad shape I couldn\u2019t eat or do\
  \ anything other than cry. \n\nI remembered those bones.\n\nI saw all these new\
  \ friends I made at the ward. V\xE2nia was bipolar but she was also a proud mom\
  \ and a great masseur. Beatriz was suicidal but she loved reading and riding a bicycle.\
  \ Marcelo self-harmed but he was one of the funniest people I have ever known...\
  \ I imagined how our bones would look like in boxes."
