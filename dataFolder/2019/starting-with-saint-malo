Text: "When one decides to travel for their birthday, Saint-Malo is not exactly the\
  \ first place to come to mind, despite its beauty. It especially doesn\u2019t come\
  \ to mind if your departing station screams Paris loud and bold in jet black. And\
  \ yet, hours before I turned twenty-two, I stretched the earth tight between all\
  \ the cliches you can conjure in the city I had been fighting so hard to be a part\
  \ of, and the asphalt- whose current sped me toward a walled city.\n\n5 hours later,\
  \ we were walking up the Grande Plage du Sillon, breathing in the sand on a windy\
  \ October evening. As our scarves tightened around our necks and the clouds hung\
  \ low, I turned to Sapna, my co-traveller, only to follow her gaze \u2013 fixed\
  \ on the distance. Against the gloom of the heavy skies stood an island \u2013 trees\
  \ and shrubs still as though untouched by the wrath of the cold. We stood still,\
  \ anchored to one place by the weight of our boots on the sand.\n\nA boy in an orange\
  \ jacket ran past us and toward a barely recognisable path that seemed to lead up\
  \ to what we later learnt to be the island of Grand B\xE9. He followed the route.\
  \ From behind, the boy was walking on water \u2013 his father cutting a rather comic\
  \ figure with his red face beaded with sweat, one hand holding his son\u2019s rainbow\
  \ tricycle over his shoulder while the other grasped his son gently by the neck.\
  \ The two often disappeared behind a thick spray of water or waves that licked the\
  \ very ground their feet had just touched.\n\nWe stood in one place, but we followed\
  \ the son and father as they reached the island\u2019s shore, only to be swallowed\
  \ up by the foliage.\n\nThe intermittent route was enticing, almost offering a journey\
  \ back in time \u2013 a time as close, yet as grey and obscure as the very waters\
  \ of Saint-Malo.  Our boots and hesitation were not for the occasion, and thus we\
  \ decided to return better prepared the next day.\n\nWe walked the narrow streets\
  \ of the town, seeing all that the walled city had to offer. From crowded art galleries\
  \ to spacious coffee-shops, our feet still felt the numbing pain the next morning\
  \ as we found ourselves on the familiar ground of Bon Secours beach.\n\nWe held\
  \ our hands over our eyes to be sure of what stood against the sun. The very road\
  \ we sought to take was now a gushing chaos of waves as the tide pulled the water\
  \ much closer to our feet than before. We gulped down our regret and moved on, consoling\
  \ our inability to access the thriving piece of land with paintings we found in\
  \ a store.\n\nAnother\u2019s work became our imagination."
