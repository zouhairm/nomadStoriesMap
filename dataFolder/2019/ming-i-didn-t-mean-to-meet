Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to find myself somewhere on the border of Cambodia and\
  \ Vietnam without passport and with just 10 bucks in my pocket. \n\tOn that day\
  \ me and my soulmate, eating the frog legs, philosophically looked into the distance\
  \ and thought about how great it would be to stay here, in Cambodia, for at least\
  \ a day, as it is so cool and tasty here. But we had a bus from Phnom Penh to Saigon\
  \ and then 5 more cities onwards, before the flight back home, so we had to go further.\
  \ Only in the bus we suddenly knew, that due to the Vietnamese Visa regulations,\
  \ we can enter Vietnam only after 2 weeks. No way\u2026How is that possible\u2026\
  But we have a return flight from Saigon in 5 days\u2026That\u2019s a catastrophe!\
  \ We started to ask our guide on the mixture of regular English and Asian English\
  \ about how can we solve this problem, are there any opportunities to deal with\
  \ customs and so on. He phoned somebody couple of times and finally said: \n\n-\t\
  You can make express-visa with the help of police, but you have to spend the night\
  \ on the border, because the Embassy doesn\u2019t work today and tomorrow is Sunday.\
  \ And it is 200 dollars for 2 Visas. \n\n200 dollars\u2026 Extremely expensive,\
  \ but still better, than going back to Phnom Penh, waiting for the attendance in\
  \ the Embassy, all this paper stuff, loss of time. Ok, let\u2019s do it and forget\
  \ this shame soon. \n\nBorder station. Our guide takes us aside and introduces us\
  \ to a suspicious-looking man: \n-\tThis is Ming. He will solve your problem, give\
  \ money to him, please.\n\nIt seemed like shade enterprise, and we asked for our\
  \ passports to be returned to us to figure it out by ourselves. \n\n-\tYour passports\
  \ are already on the way to Phnom Penh with our colleague. And Ming will bring your\
  \ passports with new Visas here tomorrow, at 2 p.m. \n\nAfter long attempts to clarify\
  \ the situation and get at least some guarantees, we gave the last cash to this\
  \ person. Of the guarantees we received only his phone number, written on a pink\
  \ sticker with a pencil. And the night in the hotel near the border for a very cheap\
  \ price. \n\nWon-der-ful. Our passports are with some unknown Cambodian on the moped.\
  \ Almost no cash and no ATMs nearby. We are in the almost empty hotel, owned by\
  \ some Chinese. A good start for a movie. Yes, on that sleepless night I was thinking\
  \ about movies. I imagined in colours the scene, that some thugs would break into\
  \ our room and take us into slavery by Cambodian mafia, sell us on organs or something\
  \ worse. \n\nTo the place of the intended meeting with the mysterious Ming we came\
  \ a bit earlier. 2 hours earlier, actually. After 1 hour we got really nervous.\
  \ Started to google about what to do in a foreign country, if you remained without\
  \ documents. Not a pleasant process. In the Embassy of Russian Federation it is\
  \ quite hard to prove that you are who you are. It is a whole quest. After half\
  \ an hour we nervously walked back and forth. \n\nAnd exactly at 2 o\u2019clock\
  \ I felt someone\u2019s hand on my shoulder. That was Ming. With a wide smile and\
  \ 2 passports with 2 Vietnamese Visas. He loaded both of us with our huge backpacks\
  \ on his moped, and we, being in a state of euphoria and happiness, blown by the\
  \ dusty wind, moved towards the border and further travelling with low budget. \n\
  \nWe wanted to stay in Cambodia for one more day and we did that. Wishes come true,\
  \ if you want. Maybe I should organize trainings and webinars on this topic?"
