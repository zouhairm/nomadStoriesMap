Text: "What if I fall? Oh but my darling, what if you fly? -Erin Hanson\n\nIt wasn\u2019\
  t just ticking off a thing on my bucket list, as I'd thought it would be. My first\
  \ ever Skydive was an experience inexpressible.\n\nWhile planning our Europe trip,\
  \ all I had fantasized was walking romantically in the medieval lanes of Seville,\
  \ admiring Gaudi\u2019s arty architecture in Barcelona & the masterpieces by Renaissance\
  \ and Baroque masters at the Prado in Madrid. I couldn\u2019t wait to experience\
  \ the cultural highs of the incredible bullfights, the Spanish sangrias, the authentic\
  \ paellas & of course the ever so passionate Flamenco. \n\n\u201CI want to Skydive\u201D\
  , my husband said a week before we took off. \u201CDo you want to do it too?\u201D\
  \ With a mumble, I said, \"Mmmm Sure, why not!\u201D not knowing what to expect.\n\
  \nSome countries just sweep you off your feet instantly while some make you fall\
  \ in love & conquer you eventually. For me, Spain was one of them. After wandering\
  \ through some of the postcard cities in Spain, we finally arrived in Barcelona.\
  \ Our Skydive was scheduled at Empuriabrava in two days. Excitement, nervousness,\
  \ thrill and a hell lot of things! There was an enthusiasm bomb in my head waiting\
  \ to explode.\n\nOn our train journey en route Empuriabrava, we met this girl from\
  \ France, who was also heading to Empuriabrava. \u201CAre you going to Skydive too?\u201D\
  \ I asked her with gleaming eyes. \u201CIt\u2019s going to be my 4th solo jump\u201D\
  \ came her euphoric response. \u2018It won\u2019t be so bad\u2019, I convinced myself\
  \ so.\n\nAfter arriving at the destination, we saw a lot of people taking off in\
  \ their planes one by one, disappearing in the clouds, all thrilled & excited for\
  \ their tandem jumps. On one side, I could see a group of jumpers practicing their\
  \ Skydive formations; and here I was with a panic attack building up inside me.\
  \ Before I could absorb all that I was feeling, we were strapping on our harnesses\
  \ & heading towards our plane. \u201CSo, who jumps first?\u201D asked one of the\
  \ instructors.\u201CME!\u201D was my impulsive response. I knew if I see my husband\
  \ jumping off the plane 15000 ft. above the ground, there was no way I would jump.\n\
  \nThe engines started & I could feel my heart in my mouth. Literally!! I knew it\
  \ was going to be one of the most ecstatic moments of my life, but what I didn't\
  \ know was, what am I going to do once this door opens? The plane was gliding swiftly,\
  \ crossing feet above the other. The striking panoramic view of the coastline meeting\
  \ the mountains was now visible. My instructor started strapping himself firmly\
  \ to me while running through the safety instructions again. His words were a blur\
  \ amidst the voice in my head telling me that the moment of truth was about to come.\n\
  \nThe doors opened. My instructor pushed me slightly to ensure I was sitting on\
  \ the edge and Oh boy, I realized that the edge is where the magic happens. The\
  \ air was gushing into my face & before I could soak in the moment, I WAS FLYING!\
  \ The earth\u2019s authority of gravity was the reality & my untamed heart came\
  \ alive like never before. No amount of words can do justice to what I felt when\
  \ I kissed the sky. One moment I felt like a powerful creature who could fly against\
  \ the will of nature. I felt like I could rule this moment. And the next, I realized\
  \ what a tiny speck of dust I am in this massive cosmos created by the almighty.\
  \ It was surreal.\n  \nIn no time the parachute opened & we were floating dreamily,\
  \ soaking in the scenery of Costa Brava.\nThe reality of surviving & the fact that\
  \ \u201CI did it\u201D were giving birth to mixed emotions. To my surprise, my instructor\
  \ helped me spot my husband from the air who had already landed before me. I couldn\u2019\
  t wait to land & share my experience with him. As I touched down & we ran towards\
  \ each other, we realized we both had tears of gratitude flowing.\n\n \nAt that\
  \ moment, we knew we would take this leap into the unknown again."
