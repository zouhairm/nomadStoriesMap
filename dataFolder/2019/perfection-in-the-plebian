Text: "Years ago, I road tripped with a friend through Germany. The second we hit\
  \ the Autobahn I took our rented Mercedes to whoop-worthy speeds, shouting out the\
  \ conversion of clicks to mph. The car was smooth and steady, solidly gripping the\
  \ earth, a contrast to my carefree elation. The exhilaration made us giddy, we were\
  \ lost within the first thirty minutes, but didn\u2019t slow until we reached snow-slicked\
  \ roads.\n\nA decade has since past. Now, as we left the Autobahn and entered the\
  \ A36 in France, my husband was driving and I found myself a passenger. In a Renault.\
  \ I glanced in the back seat and smiled at my two young daughters, \u201Cwe\u2019\
  re in France!\u201D My grip on the armrest relaxed as I welcomed the respite from\
  \ the teeth chattering that occurred every time a Mercedes blew by our econobox.\
  \ I am a very different person now.\n\nI haven\u2019t completely lost myself. This\
  \ very road trip across Western Europe was all about capturing a sense of freedom.\
  \ Freedom from the daily grind and bitterness that began chipping at my marriage\
  \ and giving sparks of wariness to my daughters' eyes. Twelve to fourteen hour days\
  \ in a pressure cooker job had taken its toll. So I quit. I remembered the ebullient\
  \ feel of the Autobahn; a road trip would be our antidote, bringing adventure as\
  \ a salve. Unexpectedly, it was in the most unassuming of places, the French rest\
  \ stops, that we found our joie de vivre.\n\nEntering France, our pace slowed to\
  \ Renault approved speeds. Teeth stopped chattering and eyes widened at the beautiful\
  \ large brown signs announcing every passing village with a pictorial representation\
  \ of the region. Why yes, we would stop and meander by the depicted river and enjoy\
  \ the local cr\xE9mant. No river? No problem. It turned out the French rest stops\
  \ often had pastoral ambiance for enjoying local bubbly.\n\nIn France, there is\
  \ bureaucracy, so tolls were a given. However, these tolls bought the most extensive\
  \ and well-kept offerings of respite and, unbelievably, fun one could imagine. Just\
  \ as every village was artfully identified, there were clearly marked signs that\
  \ seemed to appear every five kilometers or so, announcing the exact type of rest\
  \ stop amenities a traveler could expect to enjoy.\n\nThe most basic had only toilets\
  \ and picnic tables but were still equipped with music playing, supplying that extra\
  \ touch of French refinement. Others\u2019 had small wooded areas to picnic within,\
  \ use the restroom and burn off energy at a sparkling clean playground. At one of\
  \ these, we came across a green caterpillar with white tooth-brush like spikes and\
  \ a tail. For twenty minutes, we marveled, all four of us on the same page of wonder,\
  \ courtesy of the most humble of travel locale. The granddaddy of all were the French\
  \ truck stops. I dined on a fresh fruit and cheese plate, followed by a full dinner\
  \ of lasagna, green salad, and baguette. This was no convenience store roll because\
  \ in France small pleasures are culturally embedded into the mundane. My husband\
  \ and I enjoyed apr\xE8s dinner coffee on the deck, splitting the accompanying cookies\
  \ with our children.\n\nThanks to the rigor of the French government, we traveled\
  \ for days, stopping in wonderful, and well marked, small towns, secure in the knowledge\
  \ that a clean bathroom and play area would be available to meet the demands of\
  \ five-year-old bladders and restlessness. That knowledge alone, relaxed us. We\
  \ listened to audio books, practiced our French, stopped at anything that looked\
  \ interesting, discussed where we\u2019d been and where we were going. Whoop-worthy\
  \ exhilarating adventure? No, but it allowed for sweeter, softer discovery.\n\n\
  Apparently, you can\u2019t escape bureaucracy, nor the spirit of the Autobahn. Two\
  \ months after we returned to the US, two speeding tickets arrived in our mailbox.\
  \ I recalled our trip. Picking flaky rest-stop croissant crumbs from my lap, secure\
  \ in the knowledge a good cup of coffee would be only a well-marked, 5K away. Mostly,\
  \ I recalled the feeling of a Renault-sized family cocoon, sort of not speeding\
  \ down gorgeous French roads, delivering us, unexpectedly, to the very sense of\
  \ togetherness we sought. I gladly paid the fine."
