Text: "It was always a dream of mine to study literature and writing at the oldest\
  \ university in the world. \n\nMy first late January still winter day in this small\
  \ town, I say small not because of the 150,000 or so estimated population. Because\
  \ of the cities spaced areas.  The centre is actually quite small ten blocks or\
  \ so. And the city stretches out in the countrysides in all directions. Walking\
  \ out of the brand new Westgate Mall on the centre of the city, exiting to King\
  \ St, the Main Street were no cara would dare to enter because there are so many\
  \ people walking in every direction. I was heading over to the cornered market.\
  \ I understood. I finally understood why this town has been famous for its knowledge\
  \ base and intelligent community. I mean even the homeless read as many books as\
  \ they can.  Besides the breathtaking arquitecture, not only the beautiful colleges\
  \ . But all the little corners that seem to have appeared from a 17th century painting.\
  \ I had a combined feeling of traveling back to the past and imagining the everyday\
  \ of the former then young students in their classic uniforms waitin for their carriages\
  \ and then the globalized community it has developed. With more bikes parked than\
  \ bees on a beehive. All chained to the most prestigious parking spots if available.\
  \ They come and they go as they please. A most classic and popular venue is Blackwell\u2019\
  s book store. It never lacks people and never lacks books. It\u2019s philosophy\
  \ of reading is so strong you can come in, grab a book, sit down and read it. Just\
  \ like that. You don\u2019t have to buy it exactly. But you are going to want to.\
  \ \nThere are so many ethnicities living and surviving here from local, to Spaniards,\
  \ French, Asian, Arabs, Indian, Scotish, Mexican, American, German, etc. All walking\
  \ about deciding what place to visit. The restaurants are as varied and ethnic as\
  \ it\u2019s people. From Thai, and Japanese and French cuisine. I was even gladly\
  \ surprised that there was only one small little starbucks but as always KFC has\
  \ a half block of line. Maybe they are tired of the fish and chips and want more\
  \ chicken and chips. \nWandering at night is when the small town shows more amicable\
  \ colors. Preferably George St. where all the bars and pubs are, You can just walk\
  \ around and see still many people waking, some girls wearing nothing but a skit\
  \ and a shirt going to the club even if it is 0 degrees. Those poor creatures. Some\
  \ pubs might be full, or others have live and there is one or two roofstops with\
  \ tempting sounds."
