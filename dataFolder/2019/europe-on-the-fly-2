Text: "Back in the Paleozoic Era, Charles Kuralt was the \u201Con the road\u201D reporter\
  \ for CBS News. This was decades before he anchored CBS Sunday Morning, and eons\
  \ before they discovered he had a second family \u201Con the road\u201D in Montana,\
  \ but that\u2019s another blog.\nKuralt traveled the country looking for interesting\
  \ little stories in out-of- the-way places. Any time a Rotary Club got wind that\
  \ he might be in the area, he was invited to a luncheon. It happened so often that\
  \ he produced a film about what he did and how he did it, so he wouldn\u2019t have\
  \ to give the same talk over and over. \nThe film began with the camera on a distant\
  \ hillside showing a tiny speck of a motor home, gradually getting larger as it\
  \ wound its way through the countryside. In due course, Kuralt\u2019s baritone voice\
  \ explained: \u201CThis is how we travel. We go slowly, so as not to miss anything\
  \ insignificant.\u201D \nWhen we decided to take our first trip to Europe, I had\
  \ that film in mind and took note of the quirky, unusual and insignificant. If you\
  \ are looking to me for advice on what to see and where to go, you\u2019re in the\
  \ wrong blog.\nIt starts in London. Actually, it starts at home. Then Los Angeles\
  \ and then to London. It took up a good part of that day and half of the next, given\
  \ the time change. Upon finally approaching Heathrow airport the pilot announced\
  \ \u201Cwe will be landing in 30 minutes, local time.\u201D And this the man we\
  \ had trusted to fly us across the Atlantic.\nWe settled in and went to an Indian\
  \ restaurant, because, well, English food. \nWith a day before our tour started,\
  \ we set out walking. Everywhere we turned, people apologized for the horribly unseasonable\
  \ weather. It was 74 (23 C), and completely unlivable in an economy reliant on cashmere.\
  \ People in the UK, as you no doubt know, drive on the left, or wrong, side of the\
  \ road. People in the rest of Europe, except Malta and Northern Cyprus, drive on\
  \ the right, or right, side of the road.  \nWe stopped at a pub for lunch. I ordered\
  \ a toastie. A grilled cheese panini covered in butter. It is food in the way a\
  \ county fair concession stand is a restaurant. \nA word about pubs. Do not enter\
  \ one when Liverpool is playing something called football in something called the\
  \ Champions League Finals. Hard to find a seat. Hard to hear. Hard to understand\
  \ why so many people are so interested in something so uneventful. \nForget what\
  \ you\u2019ve come to believe, no one in England knows how to make a martini. I\
  \ ordered one and got a glass of dry vermouth on ice. \nEwww. \nHaving learned,\
  \ (or learnt, as the Brits would write) I asked for a glass of gin. Never mind the\
  \ olives and the proper cocktail glass. He poured a gin and tonic. Later in the\
  \ trip, at a nice restaurant where we stopped for lunch, I gave it one more try.\
  \ \nMe:   \u201CDo you make martini cocktails?\u201D Taking no chances to be confused\
  \ with Martini and Rossi.\nShe:  \u201CNo I\u2019m sorry, we don\u2019t.\u201D \n\
  Me:   \u201CReally.\u201D\nShe:  \u201CYes, I\u2019m sorry.\u201D\nMe:   \u201C\
  This is England, right? Winston Churchill? James Bond? Shaken not stirred, all that?\u201D\
  \ \nShe:  \u201CI\u2019ve heard of that but I don\u2019t know.\u201D \nAny true\
  \ martini drinker knows that stirred is the correct answer, but it is not one that\
  \ has been practiced in any bar anywhere since Sean Connery uttered the improper\
  \ directive in 1956. Shaking shatters the ice and dilutes the gin. Stirring gently\
  \ produces a much better cocktail. Cooling the glass and pouring gin directly into\
  \ it, better yet. (No matter the recipe, it is only necessary that vermouth be in\
  \ the same room).  \nWhen you order a drink in Europe, by the way, the bartender\
  \ always asks \u201Csingle or double?\u201D To them, a single is 25 milliliters,\
  \ or about enough to coat the bottom of a shot glass. It is carefully measured into\
  \ a metal thimble and poured from there. Just so you know."
