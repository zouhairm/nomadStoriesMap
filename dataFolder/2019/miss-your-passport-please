Text: "Maya is a tiny woman, with two big intense blue eyes from which you can read\
  \ all the strength and passion that her role in the Jungle gave her; plus, a phone\
  \ in her hand continuously ringing.\nFour kilometres separate the port of Calais,\
  \ in the north of France, from the Jungle, as it is called the largest refugee camp\
  \ in Europe, after Idomeni. \nI went down that road with some of the guys who had\
  \ been living in the camp for endless months in the attempt to illegally cross the\
  \ English Channel, in search of a better life in the United Kingdom.  Many other\
  \ young people lived there. Almost all of them were between 15 and 25 years old,\
  \ coming from Afghanistan, Kurdistan, Eritrea, Pakistan, Iraq, Sudan, Egypt and\
  \ other African countries.\n\nOnce I have passed the military trucks, the barbed\
  \ wire and the controls, I was finally in the Jungle. \nWalking through the alleys\
  \ of tents and the improvised shops, a feeling of mistrust in the glances I came\
  \ across was mixed with a feeling of being welcome as tourists. And this is precisely\
  \ that of being an uncomfortable tourist.  \nAfter a few hours spent wandering around\
  \ in the streets of the camp despite the extremely prohibitive conditions, however,\
  \ a sense of normality came. Everyone said hello to me, there were those who invite\
  \ me to eat in their tent or to enter their \"shops\", those who offered me a glass\
  \ of sweet tea. \nThe Jungle was really a lieu de vie as the signs on the sheets\
  \ of almost all the shacks said.\n\nThe main avenue could be imagined as the most\
  \ important commercial street in a city. The largest barracks were used as restaurants,\
  \ ranging from Afghan to Indian cuisine, with large carpets inside where you sat\
  \ barefoot. Other smaller barracks served as bars, cafes, various shops, barbers\
  \ and even bookshops. The only difference was that instead of prices and menus in\
  \ the shop windows and restaurants there were messages of freedom and hope.\nIn\
  \ the camp Maya knew everyone, she was constantly stopped by people who greeted\
  \ her or had something to ask her. She was a volunteer and activist of the association\
  \ L'Auberge des migrantes, and without her my understanding of the place would have\
  \ been little.\nShe took me to a small sand hill from where it was possible to see\
  \ the extension of the camp. In front of my eyes, an expanse of tents and shacks\
  \ opened up, almost floating on mud and rubbish slime. On the horizon, there was\
  \ a barbed-wire fence. On my right, dozens of blinding white containers stacked\
  \ on top of each other. This was, as Maya told me, the reception centre built by\
  \ the French Government, which cost 18 million euro. There was nothing else inside\
  \ but white containers of 12 beds each for a total of 1500 places. Few people have\
  \ decided to use it, all forms of socialization and community life there was basically\
  \ non-existent.\n\nA few meters from the containers, another \"neighbourhood\",\
  \ that of families living in caravans. It was here that the female part of the population\
  \ of the Jungle mainly lived.\nVolunteers had installed a vintage double-decker\
  \ bus here, which became the camp's beauty centre on Saturdays. \"The beauty day\"\
  , as the volunteers called it, was a moment strongly desired by the women of the\
  \ Jungle where for a few hours they dedicated themselves to body care with massages\
  \ and manicures.\n\n\xABMiss, your passport please!\xBB. I shook my head as if awakened\
  \ from sleep and showed my documents to the customs clerk at the Stansted airport.\
  \ I was no longer in the Jungle, I was travelling to England for my own pleasure.\
  \ While I realized this, the clerk looked at me a bit strange and repeated to me\
  \ \xABMiss, your passport please!\xBB. He was right. I was showing him a little\
  \ booklet of the French writer Emmanuel Carr\xE8re entitled \"A Calais\". I looked\
  \ better in my purse and gave him my passport.\n\nIn October 2016 the Calais camp\
  \ was cleared and all its inhabitants relocated to other centres around France.\n\
  Today there is almost nothing left of that lieu de vie."
