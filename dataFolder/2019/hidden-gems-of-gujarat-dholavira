Text: "The allure of a full moon night at the great Rann of Kutch has attracted many\
  \ a tourists, photographers and even locals month after month year on year. The\
  \ experience is definitely unmatched. The silver sky above and a silver land beneath!\
  \ But the experience we got at Dholavira was like none other. One, we were all by\
  \ ourselves with no one, absolutely no one around to break the continuity of the\
  \ snow globe we were floating inside. The occupants of just one car and the moon\
  \ and the white desert! Two, it was a full moon night obviously and was pretty late\
  \ in the night with the moon almost being overhead.\n\nThe long drive to the resort\
  \ where we were booked to stay seemed like a never-ending trail. The sun had already\
  \ set and there weren\u2019t many vehicles to give us company on the 100 odd km\
  \ long stretch to Dholavira from the closest city of Rapar. An odd blue bull somewhere,\
  \ a stray camel, eagles ominously hovering above us as if signalling to their teams\
  \ about the arrival of life from somewhere far away, a single road lined with thorny\
  \ bushes with absolutely no sign of inhabitation around it and us in our white tourist\
  \ vehicle with an enthusiastic driver to keep us amused. To be a little honest here,\
  \ there was a little apprehension somewhere deep inside with all this atmosphere\
  \ around us.\n\nWe moved on with google maps of course ; though it wasn\u2019t needed\
  \ as there was only one road to take us to our destination. Nonetheless, we city\
  \ dwellers like to know where we are heading so we kept our map on. The map showed\
  \ a large expanse of \u201Cblue\u201D on our way with our road cutting across it.\
  \ Google map \u201Cblue\u201D is normally a water body and we wondered as to what\
  \ were we about to cross to reach our destination. To add to that anxiety, our destination\
  \ is called Khadir Bet where Bet means an island!\n\nAnxiety levels rising with\
  \ the moon we reach the \u201Cblue\u201D which looked \u201Cblack\u201D and just\
  \ as we entered the zone it magically turned grey to silver. This sight compelled\
  \ us to stop and soak in this so so amazingly dream like scene. The \u201Cblue\u201D\
  \ turned out to be the white Rann of Kutch. The pristine white, not trampled upon\
  \ by human feet. Cool November breeze and this magical sight, we wanted to camp\
  \ there itself! But the anxiety soon returned and we felt it best to reach our resort\
  \ on time. After the \u201Cblue\u201D stretch got over, we entered a village which\
  \ too was eerily silent with no one around to even ask for directions. People in\
  \ rural India and especially in such remote villages wind up early and truly follow\
  \ \u201Cearly to bed and early to rise\u201D principle. Some BSF signages and a\
  \ couple of boards mentioning our resort\u2019s name gave a sigh of relief. We were\
  \ headed in the right direction!\n\nTea on my mind, some turns later we entered\
  \ the massive gates of the Resort. We parked outside a round hut which looked more\
  \ like a villager\u2019s humble abode than a reception of a resort. Two lady travellers\
  \ in the white tourist vehicle exchanged glances and wondered if they should actually\
  \ step out and stay in this place which was in the middle of nowhere with just a\
  \ few men hanging around and just a couple of light bulbs winking away at them.\
  \ But going back meant hundred km on the same route with no one around and we weren\u2019\
  t sure if Rapar had any decent places to stay too. Shaky confidence on our tired\
  \ faces, we stepped out to a very warm welcome from a gentleman who we later found\
  \ out was the owner of the resort. Tea was immediately served, without even asking\
  \ for it. We were immediately put to ease, all anxieties vanished and we had the\
  \ most delicious home cooked meal that night. Next morning was spent in making friends\
  \ and sightseeing. A truly unforgettable experience for us which left us with a\
  \ want to keep going back!"
