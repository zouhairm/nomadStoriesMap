Text: "\u201CTiene un drone?\u201D Edgar asked me with a trace of awe and more than\
  \ a little curiosity as he watched my husband filming the artwork in the hostel\
  \ where we were staying in Humahuaca with his drone. \n\u201CSi\u201D I replied,\
  \ silently grateful for the language my Spanish parents had ingrained in me while\
  \ growing up. Of course, that wasn\u2019t to be the end of the conversation.  A\
  \ question and answer session ensured between this larrikin Argentinian and my husband.\
  \ I was a stumbling interpreter because, as any Spanish speaker will tell you, Argentinian-speak\
  \ has some curious inflections and idioms that are different to Castellano Spanish.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHow high does it fly?\u201D \n\u201CHow far can it go?\u201D \n\u201C\
  Does it take good pictures?\u201D\nDarren answered this last one by showing some\
  \ footage he had taken elsewhere on our Argentinian travels. \n\nSuitably impressed,\
  \ an idea began to germinate in Edgar\u2019s mind.  You see, Edgar who is a self-proclaimed\
  \ nomad, was in Humahuaca to help Juan, the owner of the hostel, realise a new project.\
  \  A bar on the outskirts of the town. \nIt would be the only one in town with views\
  \ towards the mountains.  \nSome drone footage could be just the thing that to promote\
  \ the opening of Malegria on their Facebook page. \n\u201CIn exchange we will treat\
  \ you to an Argentinian asado!\u201D he bargained enthusiastically. \nI guess he\
  \ reasoned that an Argentinian asado would be something any tourist to the country\
  \ would want to experience. Darren was happy to oblige, asado or not, but Edgar\
  \ was adamant. This was the deal offered and it would be honoured. \nSo here we\
  \ were, two Aussies who\u2019d come to northern Argentina to go and see the Serrania\
  \ de Hornocal and who\u2019d now unwittingly gained a \u2018client\u2019 and payment\
  \ was an asado with the family who owned the hostel. \nAll it took was a drone and\
  \ a bar in the making. \n\nIt should be stressed that an Argentinian asado is not\
  \ your run-of-the-mill sausage sizzle. \nIt is a rite. \nIt is akin to preparing\
  \ to receive a religious sacrament.\nIt is probably no coincidence that like many\
  \ Christian celebrations it usually held on a Sunday. A rule we broke by having\
  \ it on Saturday. However our sin was absolved because according to Juan, \u201C\
  Every day is a Sunday if you want to have an asado.\u201D \n\nUsing a gas fired\
  \ BBQ to cook an asado is a sacrilege. Grilling must always take place over an open\
  \ fire. Meats typically put on the grill or parrilla are tira de asado, vacio, bife\
  \ ancho or lomo, but other delicacies that seldom grace an Aussie BBQ are also often\
  \ in the assortment. Chincullines (intestine), morcilla (blood sausage), ri\xF1\
  ones (kidney), and mollejas (sweetbreads) are just some of the things that might\
  \ be presented on the asado platter.  The asado is a social event, a time for getting\
  \ together and enjoying food preferably with a glass of fine Argentinian Malbec.\
  \ \n\nOur parilla was on the roof of the hostel which incidentally was also where\
  \ the laundry was hung out to dry. Access to the rooftop altar was via a precarious\
  \ ladder propped up against the side of the building. Up went the vacio, tira de\
  \ asado, chorizo and chichulines to be offered up to the great Parilla God by Juan\
  \ the asadero. Meanwhile Juan\u2019s mother and I prepared the table and a simple\
  \ garden salad or ensalada criolla to accompany the asado. Eventually Juan descended\
  \ from his rooftop dedication with the asado feast. At last it was time to partake\
  \ in the holy sustenance. \nAfter the customary aplauso para el asadero, (a round\
  \ of applause for the cook), we all tucked in with gusto. I braved the chinchulines\
  \ and found them to be crispy and utterly delicious. Who would have thought that\
  \ we would have been given mana from heaven in the form of an asado in Humahuaca,\
  \ Argentina\u2026\u2026\u2026.\n\u201CBut what about the video?\u201D I hear you\
  \ ask. Darren duly delivered his part of the deal and it was published on their\
  \ Facebook page. These days it can be found on uTube and Edgar has moved on. I still\
  \ follow his adventures via his webpage Chacay Arte."
