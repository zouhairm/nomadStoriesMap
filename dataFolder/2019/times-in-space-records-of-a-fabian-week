Text: "TUESDAY, 03.05.2019, 01:07-01h33A.M.: FLORA\u2019S ROOM.\n\nThere\u2019s so\
  \ much. Today, as Andreia said, was the rebellious one, when we both accessed revolting\
  \ feelings towards patterns, people, episodes. We keep on going through this catharsis\
  \ together. I wake up around 9am and she\u2019s reading news from the computer in\
  \ the living room. We talk and I stretch my body so it starts to wake up, too. Then,\
  \ a 3-hours-long breakfast: lots of coffee for me and cheesy tapiocas for all. Andreia\
  \ prepares fried cookies and I finally get to wash my clothes \u2014 a tough mission\
  \ in a 4-children-house with limited water supply. Later, by the bridge with no\
  \ river underneath, I connect with this trusting happiness. At the end of the day,\
  \ night-dreams are shared and we laugh at the rain-shower on our way back from the\
  \ National Park dirt road, where we went to see the stars. There\u2019s no moon\
  \ in the sky. I felt afraid of the dark and the primitive energy on those rocks.\
  \ I wonder if I'll always have this kind of Fear and where it comes from. \n\n\n\
  ____\n\nSATURDAY,  03.09.2019, 8:37-9:42P.M.: GARDEN. \n\nWe're facing our second\
  \ night with no water straight. Laying down in the hammock beneath the mango tree,\
  \ I put some piano music on my earphones and let feelings come. I watch them. There's\
  \ Tiredness, some Loneliness and a bit of Stress, too. A deep wish for Touch and\
  \ Protection, thoughts about my ex and that other boy I've met early this year.\
  \ So, that's it: I\u2019m out of my comfort zone. Not exactly nice, but I take it\
  \ as a good sign. \u201CJust let it come and have some rest\u201D, thinks my Inner\
  \ Me. \n\nI'm writing from Fabi\xE3o, a small rural community where everyone's family.\
  \ Or almost: I\u2019m an outsider and a second-time-visitor. This is where I spent\
  \ my longest non-interrupted season of 2018: from July to October, I\u2019ve worked\
  \ as a volunteer for ICMBio \u2014 the government agency responsible for the recently-opened\
  \ Perua\xE7u Caves National Park, which entrance happens to be here. This known-only-by-a-few\
  \ place holds some of Brazil\u2019s biggest and most beautiful caves. On their walls,\
  \ rupestrian paintings dating some thousand years ago indicate it's been inhabited\
  \ way before the Portuguese decided to call this land their own. \n\nLife\u2019\
  s not easy and here is no different. We are in the northern zone of Minas Gerais,\
  \ a state bigger than France and incredibly diverse. A country by itself, one could\
  \ say. I was born here, but in its southeastern part, where \"Economy does better\"\
  . It\u2019s so different back home. This is Brazilian Outback \u2014 or \u201CSert\xE3\
  o\", as we call it. Poetic, indeed, beautifully described by some of our best writers,\
  \ but hard, hot and dry. We do have some big rivers around, but... Well, water is\
  \ delicate issue. Perua\xE7u River, once big enough to create all those breathtaking\
  \ caves, is drying out. That\u2019s a smaller portrait of what\u2019s been going\
  \ on with the S\xE3o Francisco Basin, one of the biggest in Brazil. \n\n____\n\n\
  SUNDAY, 03.10.2019, 11:08P.M.: FLORA\u2019S ROOM. \n\nI laid down on a road for\
  \ the first time tonight. Shiny stars, warm pavement and darkness, altogether, make\
  \ everything seems right. It\u2019s the end of the rainy season and a windy storm\
  \ cut off part of the village\u2019s light. We\u2019re coming back from C\xE9lio\u2019\
  s place after a delicious lunch at K\xE9scia\u2019s Inn. The Yellow House \u2014\
  \ a beautiful space he and Andreia are creating together \u2014, the power of this\
  \ land and the mysteries of its original people nourished some goosebumping conversations.\
  \ I guess he\u2019ll join us for the trip. C\xE9lio is a local guide and has suggested\
  \ an expedition to mystical Montalv\xE2nia before I leave on the 22nd. That\u2019\
  s when the Umbuzeiro\u2019s Walk begins: 55km throughout another Outback, this time\
  \ in Bahia, where the Portuguese first arrived. A new biome, too: I\u2019ll leave\
  \ Cerrado to finally arrive at Caatinga, the \u201Conly truly Brazilian\u201D ecosystem\
  \ \u2014 and probably the most forgotten one. We\u2019ll follow the steps made by\
  \ our newborn Republican Army more than 100 years ago. They were about to perform\
  \ one of the biggest massacres in Brazilian History: the Canudos episode, when over\
  \ 20,000 peasants were killed between 1896-1897. It's an intriguing story. It feels\
  \ like an open sea."
