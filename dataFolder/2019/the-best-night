Text: "The entire evening had been magic. The weather was great. There was a slight\
  \ end of summer breeze cooling off the large crowd. My seat was further back to\
  \ the left of the amphitheater. I had my Tegan and Sara show tee clutched in my\
  \ hand and I had been on my feet for almost three hours and didn't even feel it.\
  \ Too giddy from the concert to notice. Everyone's eyes were tuned into what was\
  \ going on on the stage. Dallas Green had taken the stage for his encore and as\
  \ the final song of the night was about to get underway, Canadian rock legend Gord\
  \ Downey took the stage for a surprise performance of \"Sleeping Sickness\" which\
  \ Gord was featured. The ovation was thunderous it felt like all of Canada had shown\
  \ up to see the rockstar perform next to his equally talented stage partner. As\
  \ the music kicked in I was transported back to the first time I had wanted to go\
  \ to Canada. I remembered why I so desperately wanted to experience the country\
  \ I had spent years fantasizing about. It was this, the moment of pure togetherness.\
  \ No one was angry, no one cared what part of the world you were from. We were all\
  \ here to listen to some of Canada's best. As the chorus came crashing in, Dallas\
  \ sang \"Someone come and save my life,\" as I attempted to sing along an overwhelming\
  \ sense of happiness took over my body. Tears flowed down my cheeks and I had to\
  \ mouth along to the rest of the song as I could no longer find my voice. Sudden\
  \ emotional upheaval had stolen it away. As the last chords of the song played out,\
  \ the amphitheater started to head home. Throngs of people all slowly finding a\
  \ path back to their cars talking about their favorite moments and about how Gord\
  \ had come out for the end of the night. I sat, still clutching my t-shirt in my\
  \ hands and waited or the deluge of concert goers to clear a bit before taking my\
  \ leave. As I soaked in the majesty of what I had just experienced all I could feel\
  \ was pride. I had bought a concert ticket, saved up airfare and hotel money, flown\
  \ from Los Angeles to Toronto all on my own; and here I sat in the afterglow of\
  \ the best concert of my life in one of the most welcoming cities I had ever been\
  \ to. \n\nSince stepping foot onto Canadian soil, I knew I was in for a treat. The\
  \ food was great, the art and architecture were impressive, but it was the people.\
  \ The bus drivers, hotel attendants, and more importantly the people I had surrounded\
  \ myself with for almost five hours at Molson Amphitheater, that hold the strongest\
  \ place in my heart. They welcomed a lost little girl into their home with open\
  \ arms and open hearts and led me to an unforgettable experience. I had no idea\
  \ what money I was spending on the bus system, or where to go once I left the airport,\
  \ and the people of Toronto stopped what they were doing to give me a hand. It was\
  \ those people that I was surrounded with as we sang along and loved the same music\
  \ for different reasons. It is those people that I talk about with utter delight\
  \ every time I retell the story of my favorite concert experience and it is the\
  \ people of Toronto whom I speak highly of whenever someone needs a recommendation\
  \ on a place to visit and why."
