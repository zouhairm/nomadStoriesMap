Text: "Once upon a time, in the Mughal Empire, Emperor Shah Jahan had just lost his\
  \ third wife whom he loved madly, Mumtaz Mahal (meaning light of the palace), and\
  \ who was to give birth to their fourteenth child. So that this love which he bore\
  \ to her survived through the ages, and in the most beautiful manner, he decided\
  \ to offer her the most beautiful mausoleum of all time. It was therefore, 22 years\
  \ of construction, 22000 men to task, 12000 elephants carrying the best marble of\
  \ a city from the depths of India, which gave this architectural gem: The Taj Mahal\
  \ or Palace of the crown. Legend tells that he has been imprisoned by his successor,\
  \ and that from his prison he could admire the mausoleum, where he now rests alongside\
  \ his beloved.\n\nMy guided tour of the Taj Mahal\n\nIf today the Taj Mahal is one\
  \ of the 7 Wonders of the world and the most visited site of India, it is thanks\
  \ to its knocking-down-architecture ; Entirely made of marble, and mosaics, without\
  \ paint and added material. Several texts borrowed from the Koran are engraved on\
  \ all sides, reminding visitors of the importance of faith, and the misfortunes\
  \ awaiting the infidels. You can also observe that this marble has this intriguing\
  \ that it is essentially porous and reflects light through, such as a lampshade.\n\
  \nMy visit started with the gardens of the south entrance, marveling me with their\
  \ grandeur and their beauty. If the mausoleum is the most famous monument, it must\
  \ be noted that there are several other buildings to admire: the vast and beautiful\
  \ gardens, the houses of the servants, those of the maids, the wall leading to the\
  \ mausoleum, which is also an incredible architecture, the Mosque is still in use\
  \ today. From the beginning, I am greeted by texts from the Koran. They are located\
  \ in several places in the garden. The text at the entrance invites me to enter\
  \ Paradise, \"the abode of the faithful and the reward of the righteous\" (Thanks\
  \ to my guide for translation). So the adrenaline rises and I am more than anxious\
  \ to arrive at the mausoleum. The gardens offer me a taste of paradise...\n\nI sat\
  \ there and I forgot everything\n\nAfter passing the great gate leading to the mausoleum,\
  \ I did not expect it at all. Well, it is standing right in front of me, standing\
  \ majestically up to the sky. It is an impressive and intriguing palace. It is both\
  \ complete and empty, it seems both strong and fragile. He resisted the time, the\
  \ looting, we would like to understand it so much, but we do not manage. The Taj\
  \ Mahal is so special, and it represents so perfectly love. Is even more intriguing,\
  \ the contrast between the feeling of peace and gentleness that offers you the sight\
  \ of the mausoleum, and the severity of the Quranic texts chosen to decorate it\
  \ (they speak of the eternal torments of the infidels).\nI sat on a bench and did\
  \ not stop to contemplate it. I could have stayed there all my life admiring it.\
  \ This monument is certainly the most accomplished work resulting from a heartbreaking\
  \ love story. Once at his feet, one feels as inspired, as hopeful, recharged, with\
  \ a revival of good humour.\n\nHow to get there\nThe Taj Mahal is open every day,\
  \ except on Friday, the day of prayer of the Muslims. To spare some time, you will\
  \ need to take a rickshaw from the main gate to the checkpoint. The entry will cost\
  \ you 1000 Indian rupees (nearly \u20AC14), which is 40 times more expensive than\
  \ nationals. But that saves you from the queue, which can be very long sometimes,\
  \ you are also given a bottle of water and you do not have to get off your shoes\
  \ at the entrance of the mausoleum like the others, you have plastic bags (from\
  \ recycled materia) that you put on your shoes.  The best hours to take good pictures\
  \ are the sunset and the sunrise.\nIt wasn't in my bucket-list, but I loved it."
