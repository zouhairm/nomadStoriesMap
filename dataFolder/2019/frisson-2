Text: "Thrill shivers. A shudder of arousal. The icy hot tingle of being immersed\
  \ in an awesome moment, in an awesome place, where the air pulsates with ancient\
  \ promises and whispers secret wisdom into the nape of your neck. I had felt it\
  \ at Machu Picchu, Stonehenge, Petra, The Great Pyramids\u2026my journeys to these\
  \ places have challenged me, frightened me, and demanded my expansion. But none\
  \ more profoundly than a nudist resort in Kissimmee, Florida.\nAll I wanted was\
  \ to go for a late-night swim on my birthday. As I began my search for available\
  \ swimming pools at 10 p.m. on a weekday, I hardly imagined that a serendipitous\
  \ lack of other options would culminate in me taking my birthday swim in my birthday\
  \ suit, in a pool of naked strangers.\nAfter a 30-minute drive from my home, I arrived\
  \ at a non-descript enclave full of someone\u2019s grandparents and their RVs. It\
  \ looked like a typical Central Florida RV park, only the grandparents were not\
  \ wearing pants. It was not unlike landing in a far-off country\u2014or planet\u2014\
  where surroundings are somehow both familiar and foreign, and demands are made on\
  \ your most deeply held mores and ability to observe without judgement. \nThe first\
  \ rule of etiquette in most modern societies is that we hide our genitals from one\
  \ another during polite and platonic encounters. Here, apart from all the private\
  \ parts on display, the rules of acceptable social behavior are not much different.\
  \ It\u2019s a family friendly place. Lewd behavior and public sexual activity are\
  \ not tolerated. \u201CIt\u2019s not polite to stare\u201D is perhaps an even truer\
  \ adage in a nudist colony.\nPeople with Santa-Clause-beard colored pubic hair made\
  \ eye contact and waved, and it was clear I was going to have to adapt quickly.\
  \ I grappled with four or five stages of culture shock in a matter of minutes. It\u2019\
  s not that we could all see each other\u2019s private parts. It\u2019s that we had\
  \ all tacitly agreed to be comfortable with it. There was a lot to unpack in a place\
  \ with so little baggage.\nAfter signing in at the front office, I chose a spot\
  \ by the pool and quickly peeled off my breezy cotton armor. With a manufactured\
  \ confidence, I sauntered into the bar and ordered a drink special. With every bulge,\
  \ dimple, scar and stretch mark on display, not only does no one recoil or deride\
  \ me like I feared, but I am treated politely and apparently viewed with the same\
  \ regard as I would if I walked into a bar in jeans and a hoodie. I begin to believe\
  \ I am the young, hot one on the premises, for once in my life. Men in the bar ogle\
  \ me with about the same restraint I would expect if I were fully clothed. \nI return\
  \ to the pool and immerse myself. This is what I enjoy most of all, skinny dipping\
  \ without fear of being scolded. Every sensation of being alive is enhanced, and\
  \ somehow, I feel reunited with myself. Parts of my skin that usually miss out on\
  \ the tactile pleasure of flowing through water with the rest of my body, perceiving\
  \ subtle changes in temperature, or simply getting enough oxygen, are now uncovered\
  \ and free to join in. As I reconnect with my own body, I connect with the sky,\
  \ the moonlight, and the ocean of molecules that surround me, until I perceive only\
  \ a lack of distinction between myself, the body of water I\u2019m swimming in,\
  \ and the bodies of other people swimming in it as well. I begin a friendly conversation\
  \ with people nearby. \u201CPeople are just nicer when they\u2019re naked\u201D\
  , someone remarks. Their simple observation gives me chills. I ponder the power\
  \ of vulnerability, and how many ways there are to travel to places that break down\
  \ the walls that fragment us. Sometimes it begins when we take off our clothes.\n\
  My fear of public nudity was once so primal that it haunted my most chilling nightmares.\
  \ Now I know how little there is to fear. I crave the feeling of breeze against\
  \ my skin, where the air pulsates with promise, and the wind whispers secret wisdom\
  \ into the nape of my neck."
