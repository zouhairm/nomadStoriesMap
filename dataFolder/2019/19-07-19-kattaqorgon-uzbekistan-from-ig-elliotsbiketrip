Text: "Our day in the park. \PWe rolled into the Alisher Navoiy Park in Kattaqorgon.\
  \ A green park with tall trees and flowers. It looked perfect for a day of rest\
  \ before our final night ride to Samarkand.\P Named after the great Turkic poet,\
  \ writer, politician, linguist and painter. A 16th century show-off.\P I set my\
  \ bike down against a tree next to ice cream stand. A young lad came over and asked\
  \ about us. He spoke good English and I explained that we were looking for a place\
  \ to rest. He invited me immediately to the ground by the tree near his stand and\
  \ bought over a carpet that was covering the spare bottles of water he had at the\
  \ stall to keep them cool. However, his father had seen this and berated him. He\
  \ looked at me and apologised. I said there was no need and helped him put the carpet\
  \ back.\P I sat down at the table and bought a cola from him whilst Arthur went\
  \ in search of a more permanent resting spot. As I sat, a man came over and introduced\
  \ himself. Tahir, was the Park Director. He had plans to develop the park further.\
  \ An ex-military commander he was a stern man with a soft heart. His joy was now\
  \ found in seeing people enjoy the park.\P I told him about our bike trip and he\
  \ pointed to a building that Arthur had walked over to. It was a social hall for\
  \ the elderly of the town. They gather to discuss social affairs. We walked over\
  \ to the building where Arthur had met Zaffir, a man who seemed to be in charge\
  \ the building.\P We set our mats down under the canopy and dozed. The heat grew\
  \ and I woke up to find a sweat silhouette of my calves on my thermarest, yuk. \P\
  Zaffir showed us inside and told us we could use the kitchen and shower! We hadn\u2019\
  t showered in four days! I cooked spaghetti and explained to Zaffir that we had\
  \ been ill so we couldn\u2019t eat at the Chai Hanna in the park.\P The day had\
  \ other plans for us. Zaffir invited us to a party in the park and slowly guests\
  \ arrived. The mayor arrived at the hall and asked if we would have our photo taken\
  \ for the Kattaqorgon Gazette, a weekly paper that is distributed around town. Love\
  \ that, absolutely yes! Then, the boy from the drinks stall shouted us over. Two\
  \ girls wanted to talk to us to practice their English. We went over and spoke to\
  \ them about life in Kattakurgan. They were going to be studying English Language\
  \ at Samarkand University in September and were excited. They were happy to see\
  \ tourists visiting their city as not many tourists visited their city with Samarkand\
  \ receiving more attention.\P Then, whilst Arthur player football with the boy and\
  \ his friends, I spoke with Tahir. We spoke using Google translate. It\u2019s so\
  \ powerful and I am lucky to be travelling with this technology in my pocket. \P\
  We discussed family. He had recently lost both of his parents and told me that I\
  \ was incredibly lucky to have such close relationships to my parents and grandparents.\
  \ I was missing them. He showed me architectural plans for the park. His dream was\
  \ to create and open air theatre for summer showings of movies and drama performances.\
  \ The plans looked amazing and we exchanged contact details so that once complete\
  \ he could send me photos. \PWe walked over to the meeting hall where more people\
  \ had arrived. It was dusk and a large frying pan was being prepared to cook a large\
  \ amount of Plov, the national dish of Uzbekistan. Rice cooked with carrot and spices\
  \ topped with lamb. In Kattaqorgon, it is called \u201COsh\u201D and the guys laughed\
  \ heartily when I used the local name. \PVodka bottles appeared and we knew better\
  \ than to refuse. We gave up on plans to start riding that night and the after a\
  \ few more shots gave up on plans to even set an alarm.\PWe said goodnight just\
  \ before midnight and slumped on to our sleeping mats. Go and enjoy your local park."
