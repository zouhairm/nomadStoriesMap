Text: "I have spent the last 6 years living across the pond as they say, first in\
  \ the United Kingdom and now in Italy.  Over 4000 miles from my family in America,\
  \ and yet I am closer to them than ever before.\n\nWhat often scares people the\
  \ most about living away from home is the loss of connection and the loneliness\
  \ that would accompany such a loss.  I do miss out on family gatherings, the day\
  \ to day conversations and nuances.  Sometimes I wish I could be at my nephew\u2019\
  s birthday party, be eating pumpkin pie with my family on thanksgiving, or watching\
  \ Survivor with my sister and her family, commenting on this or that players ultimate\
  \ demise.  I have had conversations that are interrupted with \u201Coh, I must have\
  \ forgot to tell you\u201D more times than I care to admit.  While it is true that\
  \ my time is limited with my loved ones to short spurts once or twice a year, the\
  \ time is cherished and soaked in the kind of quality time that leads to deep connection\
  \ and lasting memories only traveling together can offer. \n\nI\u2019ve celebrated\
  \ with my two oldest niece\u2019s their high school graduations zip lining from\
  \ Spain to Portugal.  My sister-in-law and I took a long walk on a snowy trail in\
  \ the beautiful Dolomites, the mountains and conversation bringing us closer than\
  \ ever.  I had a 5 course symphony of an Italian meal with my father and stepmother\
  \ overlooking the Basilica of St. Francis of Assisi.   I met one of my cousins for\
  \ the first time in his home country of Sweden, connecting him to other family members\
  \ when we all met in London.  I drove my brother and aunt over the impossibly small\
  \ bridge over the impossibly teal waters of Lago di Barcis, keeping jet lag at bay\
  \ with a bit of adrenaline.  My favorite memory of my nephew is his smile, at 18\
  \ years old and college bound, drinking a German sized beer while riding a bicycle\
  \ through the Englischer Garten park in Munich.  Laughing hysterically with another\
  \ niece in Iceland as we try to get the perfect slo-mo video of the geyser\u2019\
  s much anticipated but unpredictable eruptions.  With my mother, I watched horses\
  \ dance in Vienna, Flamenco dancers in Barcelona and gondolier drivers glide through\
  \ the Venice canals, with her planning her next visit before she had even left.\n\
  \nWhen I moved to Europe 6 years ago, I didn\u2019t expect to become closer to my\
  \ family members than I was living just a short drive away from them.  When I recently\
  \ told member\u2019s of my family that I am considering taking a job that would\
  \ have me living back in America and close to home, there was no doubt in my mind\
  \ that that they too cherish the time they have spent traveling with me just as\
  \ much as those day to day moments I sometimes feel I\u2019m missing.  The most\
  \ common reaction has been \u201Cwe\u2019re happy to have you home, but we\u2019\
  ll miss visiting you\u201D."
