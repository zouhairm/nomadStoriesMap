Text: "Who says that love at first sight is a myth? I've always been open minded but\
  \ never in a million years would I think that a journey to find myself would result\
  \ in me finding the love of my life. I've always had wanderlust and started traveling\
  \ immediately after I started making money as a waitress while attending college\
  \ to become an interior designer. \n\nI started out with big plans and made my way\
  \ to Greece, alone, when I was a young woman of 23. There it was where I encountered\
  \ a Gipsy fortune teller who honed in on me and insisted that she tell my fortune.\
  \ I agreed, gave her 5,000 drachmas and listened intently as she told me, \"you\
  \ will travel far from where you live now (Ft. Lauderdale at that time), it will\
  \ be the best thing you'll ever do in your life and affect you for the rest of your\
  \ life. Also remember the name, Juergen, because he is 'the one'! \n\nI thought,\
  \ Juergen, that sounds German and I don't have any plans to travel there. I had\
  \ escaped Western Pennsylvania to get away from gray and cold weather and had no\
  \ desire to visit a place that was similar. \n\nSo I remembered what the gypsy had\
  \ told me as the years passed. Once again, at 29, my wanderlust urged me on and\
  \ I decided that I wanted to live in Rome for a summer to immerse myself in the\
  \ language and culture of my forefathers. So I told my boss that I was going to\
  \ Italy, packed all my belongings into a storage locker and rented out my condo\
  \ to two friends. As chance would have it, I met a German man who owned a textile\
  \ mill, which was the business I now was involved in. He invited me to work a few\
  \ weeks in Germany and that's what I did. I thought that was odd since I indeed\
  \ ended up in Germany. \n\nAfter a stint there, working in the mill, I decided to\
  \ fulfill my real dream and finally live in Rome. I took my beat up car and drove\
  \ over the Alps and into Italy, ending up in Rome and staying there a year, doing\
  \ odd jobs and fending off a slew of Italian suitors. After an ultimatum from my\
  \ father who was tired of sending me money and a feeling that it was time, I decided\
  \ to return to the U.S. \n\nI made my way back to Germany, to get rid of my German\
  \ car and went a party on my LAST NIGHT I was there. I looked across the room, and\
  \ there was a good looking guy smiling back at me. It was love at first sight. He\
  \ approached me and when he told me his name, I almost fell over. \n\nHis name was\
  \ Juergen. THAT was the name the gypsy told me. Finally , after eons and many, many\
  \ lifetimes, I had met the one who made me feel complete. He was 23 at the time\
  \ and I was 31. It was an unexplainable feeling but it was true. I knew in an instant\
  \ that he would be my husband. \n\nWe had a long distance romance for a short time\
  \ but eventually he moved to America and we married and had two beautiful sons.\
  \ We still talk about this story today, after 24 years and can't believe that it\
  \ really happened. But it's true. \n\nThere have been good and bad times for sure\
  \ in our life, but we have a bond that people only dream about and know for sure,\
  \ that there is indeed 'love at first sight', as we are living examples of it happening.\
  \ \n\nI am a firm believer that if you dream it, you can achieve it as well as a\
  \ belief in the laws of attraction. My curiosity and wanderlust has led me on an\
  \ incredible journey which isn't over yet. I just go with the flow, traveling where\
  \ the wind and fate takes me and telling my story when I can. \n\nWhat's important\
  \ is not how you get there but who you meet along the way."
