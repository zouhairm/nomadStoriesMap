Text: "I wake up suddenly as my head bumps against the window when the van stops.\
  \ My legs are numb and cramped from the 15-hour drive from Leh for we got the back\
  \ seats of the mini-van to save 300 rupees. It's pitch black outside; commotion\
  \ rules the streets as we get off. A man grabs me by the arm and tells me to get\
  \ off the streets - \"it's dangerous in Kashmir at 4:30 am and prayers are about\
  \ to start. Come with me\". I look to my companion, we shrug shoulders, smiling\
  \ naively we obey.\n\nThis man, around fifty, walks confidently and quickly. Suddenly\
  \ he walks down underneath a bridge, we hesitate, a bit anxious and confused but\
  \ can't be bothered, we're too tired from the overnight trip on a nerve-wracking\
  \ road. We continue towards a boat house. Knock the door and wait with a mix of\
  \ excitement and alarm - the kind of rush I used to get as a kid when ringing people's\
  \ doorbell to run away as quickly as I could. A kind man with hazel eyes opens the\
  \ door and welcomes us in. No need to run. He lays a mattress on the floor inviting\
  \ us to rest until the sun comes out. It's mid-October and it's cold, so we lay\
  \ down - my heart feels a rush, half nervous, half in faith.\n\nWe wake up to saffron\
  \ tea, eggs and a biscuit. Gulam offers us a room with meals for 500 rupees per\
  \ day at his rental room on the boat a deal we can't resist, plus a full tour of\
  \ Srinagar if we stay. We hesitate so he provides extensive proof with detailed\
  \ reviews of past guests. We take another cup of the elixir and we're seduced by\
  \ our charming host.\n\nIn the rush of leaving Leh in a last minute decision we\
  \ didn't plan much for Kashmir nor we had a guide book at all. Embassies the world-round\
  \ have red flags on this part of the world, a no go zone for many, an invitation\
  \ to explore in my language though. Our first tourist spot was famous Chashma Shahi\
  \ Flower Garden that overlooks Dal Lake where beautiful Kashmiri people indulge\
  \ in picnics and photoshoots, food sharing and making out - a scene out of Bollywood.\
  \ \n\nThis is no India though, people look, speak, dress and eat differently! The\
  \ tension in the streets is palpable as Indian military cover the streets with various\
  \ checkpoints - the soldiers still indulge us with selfies with my companion and\
  \ me, Gulam laughs and shoots my camera masterfully while cracking jokes and mocking\
  \ accents. They call themselves Kashmiri, not Indian, not Pakistani: free people\
  \ of their own and self-sufficient. My companion is the center of attention wherever\
  \ we go, for her blonde hair is as rare a find as a blue whale in this part of the\
  \ world.\n\nThe tour proceeds to the market to eat typical Kashmiri food: lamb cooked\
  \ in yogurt, the cook is delighted to serve us with his bare hands. We stop shrines\
  \ to offer prayers to Allah while facing in the direction of Mecca, our new friend\
  \ Gulam is patient and passionate, we are in great hands always feeling safe. The\
  \ next day we go early morning to a famous carpet shop where they receive us with\
  \ saffron tea and biscuits. I couldn't resist and I bought six handmade Kashmiri\
  \ carpets and shipped them back home. Kashmiri's know how to seduce.\n\nThe adventure\
  \ continues into the mountains - the only shrine Gulam believes in - at a riverside\
  \ village of authentic gypsies that prepare for the last days of warmth before leaving\
  \ the countryside for the winter. We sit by the bukhari - wood stove - to cook authentic\
  \ mountain food: rice and lentils with vegetables. We top it with chai and a half-understood\
  \ conversation with the locals. Gulam feels like a good old friend, he understands\
  \ the traveler for his eyes shine to know people all over the world. He's a passionate\
  \ story teller and the kindest of hosts.\n\nGulam and I keep in touch and the carpets\
  \ remind me fondly of Kashmir and our endless cups of tea."
