Text: "As strong as an impenetrable fortress she rose above us, all five feet of her.\
  \ Armed with argan oil and a loofa, she kept watch that all movement was conducted\
  \ in accordance with the rules she had set in place. This was her realm \u2013 the\
  \ place where she could show herself as Allah truly made her. \n     I had been\
  \ studying in Andaluc\xEDa for a year when I had the pleasure of relaxing in what\
  \ I believed to be authentic Arabic baths.  On tours I had wandered through the\
  \ star-lit, cavernous ruins of the hot and cold rooms of centuries past in La Alhambra\
  \ and Los Reales Alc\xE1zares. I imagined myself immersing in a tradition that had\
  \ taken place in the land since the Muslim invasion of 711. Candles hanging from\
  \ stained glass lanterns shone the way from pool to sauna as melodious tunes echoed\
  \ along the marble walls. I was unaware of being enraptured in a modern day illusion\
  \ of false grandeur that had captivated me until I visited a hammam in Morocco a\
  \ month later.\n     I had never set foot in Africa and quickly accepted my roommate,\
  \ Sara\xB4s, invitation to join her on a trip to Meknes. Remembering my recent spa\
  \ indulgence, I convinced her to come with me to the local hammam. After passing\
  \ through the gates, we entered a small, yet tidy changing room. As I fetched my\
  \ suit I tried to calm my excitement about the pools behind the door. Suddenly,\
  \ Sara and I were approached by a rather thickset woman who demanded we return our\
  \ swimsuits to the lockers. There was a confused exchange of glances, but we knew\
  \ this lady au-natural was not someone you\xB4d want to disobey.  Our eyes followed\
  \ her as she passed through a beaded partition and we caught glimpses of several\
  \ other unclothed women sitting to tea. Tentatively, we got undressed and proceeded\
  \ through the door.\n     We were hit by a steamy wall which further increased my\
  \ anticipation to see what lay hidden beyond. Eventually, among the clouds, we could\
  \ discern a large, dark shadow. It seemed to be consuming the space around it until\
  \ I could see that it was the same woman from before. She shoved small packages\
  \ of what appeared to be some kind of soap into our hands and pointed through a\
  \ clearing in the fog to a series of pipes lining one of the walls. We approached\
  \ the metal tubes and found small wells carved into the floor below them. They were\
  \ too shallow to be baths and had no stoppers for the drains at the bottom. Before\
  \ I had time to process my surroundings, the robust woman was upon us, raising a\
  \ loofah above her head like a Statue of Liberty proclaiming cleanliness for us\
  \ all. She quickly descended upon Sara\xB4s back, going back and forth until red\
  \ splotches began appearing. Another glance was stolen between us as I hesitantly\
  \ took my soap and attempted to scrub my own back. Our sighs of relief added to\
  \ the surrounding steam when the matron moved on to a different bather. We finished\
  \ washing before she could return.\n     Back in the locker room, Sara started to\
  \ feel unwell and needed to lie down. In an instant, the loofa woman was by her\
  \ side, one hand on Sara\xB4s head and the other on her wrist. I thought I witnessed\
  \ another emotion appear behind her steel fa\xE7ade, perhaps one of compassion,\
  \ but she was on her feet with complete determination before I could get a better\
  \ look. She flew in and out of the beaded curtain, a small silver pot in hand. She\
  \ spoonfed its contents to my friend then rushed for a glass of water. She stayed\
  \ by Sara\xB4s side until she regained her strength and sent us off with a shot\
  \ of Morrocan whiskey - very sweet mint tea. As I took one last look into the room,\
  \ I felt we were leaving some odd family home. It was definitely not the hammam\
  \ experience I had been expecting. Instead, it was the treatment of a long forgotten\
  \ mother who would never cease to care for those who stopped by for a visit."
