Text: "It was the quietest palace I had visited thus far, quieter than Unhyeongung\
  \ in the gentle summer rain, far quieter than Gyeongbokgung had been as my classmates\u2019\
  \ feet shuffled along beside me on our class trip. The kind of place that made me\
  \ want to tiptoe as I wove through the crooked trees, along a small bridge over\
  \ a still green pond, between buildings painted in the traditional dancheong style.\
  \ From behind one of the buildings, I heard the sound of a dog\u2019s leash as a\
  \ groundskeeper slid open a door, but the silence returned as quickly as it had\
  \ gone.\n\nAs soon as I left the palace grounds, the world came back to life. The\
  \ insistent songs of cicadas rose up from rice paddy after rice paddy. A car passed;\
  \ an ajeossi with a sunburnt face stared as I nodded hello, then continued on his\
  \ way.\n\nWhat they don\u2019t tell you about traveling alone is that there is a\
  \ very real chance you\u2019ll be too shy to use your butchered Korean to ask if\
  \ your T-Pass from Seoul will work down here in Gyeongju, and the nearest visitor\
  \ center will have hours based on an algorithm that King Gyeongsun himself must\u2019\
  ve taken to his grave. You might end up walking seven hours to Poseokjeong just\
  \ to think \u201CWhere\u2019s the rest?\u201D, only to find out that really is all\
  \ there is. You might look at your phone and realize how long you\u2019ve been walking,\
  \ bark out a laugh and plop down in the welcome center with a Pocari Sweat.\n\n\
  What they do tell you is the location of a tiny temple you might as well stop at\
  \ on your way back\u2014it\u2019s en route, after all.\n\nBunhwangsa, it was called.\
  \ Built under Queen Seondeok around 634 C.E. Strings of colored paper lanterns crisscrossed\
  \ overhead; small Buddha statues lined the edges of the pagoda, stacks of coins\
  \ placed in front of them as offerings. My eyes wandered to a nearby Buddha carved\
  \ of light grey stone. I took out my wallet and placed a few hundred won next to\
  \ him, wondering if the sense of peace that spread through me was coincidence or\
  \ not.\n\nAfter half an hour, I wandered out a side entrance and followed signs\
  \ to what looked like an empty field.\n\nOnly up close did I notice squares of stone\
  \ embedded in the grass, the surfaces patterned in the distinct way of cracked stone\
  \ worn down by the elements and soles of shoes over the years. There was something\
  \ in the air that was both electrifying and impossibly ancient. I made a beeline\
  \ to a nearby sign in hopes of figuring out what it was.\n\nPeople often speak of\
  \ how humbled they felt when they first witnessed the sheer size and beauty of the\
  \ Taj Mahal, when they first saw photos from the Hubble telescope or stood in front\
  \ of Gaudi\u2019s Sagrada Familia. \n\nBut standing there, reading that those dull\
  \ stone squares once bore the weight of a magnificent temple later ransacked and\
  \ incinerated by Mongol warriors...I found what I had been chasing. The Grand Symphony\
  \ of Humanity, in which\u2014as with any symphony\u2014certain sections played louder\
  \ than others, then piped down until it was their time again.\n\nI closed my eyes.\
  \ I felt the breeze dry sweat on my cheeks. \n\nAnd I walked back towards town until\
  \ I came to a small kalguksu shop, where I stopped for supper. \n\nWhat they don\u2019\
  t tell you about traveling alone? That the owner, an elderly woman with a kind face,\
  \ will laugh and try to educate you on the proper way to eat mandu. That you\u2019\
  ll shift contentedly on your lumpy floor mat, listening to the gleeful shrieks of\
  \ the owner\u2019s granddaughter as her father chases her around with a stuffed\
  \ animal. \n\nThat as you sit smiling softly, the words of Haruki Murakami will\
  \ come to mind\u2014ironic, given the historical animosity between Korea and Japan,\
  \ but they will come nonetheless. \n\n\u201CBeing alone in two senses of the word\
  \ was maybe like a double negation of isolation. In other words, it made perfect\
  \ sense for him, a foreigner, to feel isolated here. The thought calmed him. He\
  \ was in exactly the right place.\u201D"
