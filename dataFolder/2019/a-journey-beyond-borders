Text: "I hail from a small town in South Africa in the North West Province called\
  \ Rustenburg \nnever have i really thought of leaving my home and taking a trip\
  \ out of the country,i wanted to see nuce places like Cape town and Durban but if\
  \ I had money i would have toured the world as i love adventure and art and new\
  \ memories,but sometimes talking is hard to explain,i always dreamt of going our\
  \ of my home country even if its a neighboring one and God said yes madam you will\
  \ go and please return with the answers you seek..I borded the bus from Johannesburg\
  \ park station second main town in Gauteng ,I did not know what the trip would have\
  \ in store for me.It was a sudden choice to wonder North and make the best of it\
  \ was going to  Malawi but somehow landed in a simple yet beautiful country and\
  \ city called Lichinga, a town north of Mozambique and as i was told was a few kilos\
  \ from Tanzania.Wondering alone into a strange world, calling it an adventure meanwhile\
  \ it was a trip to find myself and to get peace of mind,Feeling weak and like and\
  \ under achiever and unable to face the world i told myself im not running away,i\
  \ am simply just walking away and trying to find peace of from the pieces i threw\
  \ away.I had to go.Unlike my elder siblings who done well in school and got many\
  \ accolades and medals.I was the unbright one but good in sports and art and i loved\
  \ to climb trees and mountains just to sit on top and watch the sun rise or sun\
  \ set.At night i would talk to the stars.But according to the world im from Art\
  \ a d sports is something that get you no where in life.Only Doctors and engineers\
  \ fo well .I passed 3 borders to reach Malawi via Zimbabwe route.It was the first\
  \ time i went accross borders and my heart was in my throat.The adrenalin kicked\
  \ in when i saw the beautiful nature that surrounds us and then my breath went.I\
  \ was amazed..i grasp for air not due to shock but due to the magnificent lake that\
  \ i saw..Lake Malawi.Its colours were like a oceanic blue with a mixture of teal.Truely\
  \ the earth without art is eh.I spent 10 days in Malawi at Club makokola,sun and\
  \ sand and cape maclear holiday resorts,canoe,fishing and swiming it was different.Compared\
  \ to the places we have here in South Africa.The culture is diffrent and also there\
  \ are two tribes of Malawi i know off The Yao and Chewa.Yao is muslim follwers and\
  \ the Chewa is Christian.There are also other tribes who follow traditional beliefs.I\
  \ learnt how to make smalk talk and greet in the Yao language.I laughed at myself\
  \ also because i sounded funny.The locals of Mangochi were hospitable and friendly.I\
  \ even wore a nsalo which is a cloth malawi women use to wrap around the bodies.I\
  \ was in the village area.Here i saw that life is not like the way i have it back\
  \ home also the food is amazing,especially the fish.I got to like fish and beans\
  \ because of the people.After 10 days i journeyed north and went into Mozambique\
  \ the area is Nyasa province.The pepple in the area were so welcoming,they spoke\
  \ a language which sounded like swahili.Having a rich history of Portuguese conquerors\
  \ and islamic history i decided i want to see the place.I spent 7 days which was\
  \ not enough because i did not get time to explore.Even so the place is surrounded\
  \ by beautiful mountains and and nature.Even the fruits of Lichinga was so sweet\
  \ and it was like a delicacy.It was then i realised that anytime i should return\
  \ i will find family because these people do not care who you are or where you from,all\
  \ they see is a brother or sister and they treat you like family,tget show you love\
  \ and give you .security.This what I didnt expect to find love friendship and brotherhood\
  \ on my journey across borders.But if u had to repeat this  trip i surely would\
  \ and this time,i will surely stay longer and create more fun filled,Amazing and\
  \ definitely adventurous memories"
