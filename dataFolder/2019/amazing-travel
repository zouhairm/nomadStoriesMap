Text: "Lahore: I visited Lahore in 7-10 November 2009. I satyed in Avari Hotel, the\
  \ security is extremely tight, 6 layers of security will check you before your car\
  \ will reach the lobby.\n\nArriving in Lahore airport was ok, changed some money\
  \ at the airport money changer. On other days, we changed money at Western Union.\n\
  \nI visited Lahore fort, Badshahi mosque was impressive, has some similarity with\
  \ Jama masjid in Delhi. Next day was Iqbal day, so there were some extra security\
  \ in the fort which caused some delays in getting entrance to certain areas etc.\
  \ But the security folks were very friendly and welcoming. We also visited the Pakistan\
  \ Minar and then on to Jahangir\u2019s tomb. It was not in great shape. Next to\
  \ it was the tomb of Mumtaj Mahal\u2019s (Taj mahal is named after her) father which\
  \ was crumbling down. We wanted to visit the tomb of Nur Jahan but the road leading\
  \ to the tomb was closed and it was not well preserved either. One afternoon, we\
  \ went to Wagah border to witness the closing ceremony of the border gates. The\
  \ road leading to Wagah is quite bad in certain areas, it took close to 2 hours\
  \ to reach there. Watching the ceremony was fun and the view from men\u2019s stand\
  \ is not great as it is located quite far away. We did some shopping in Gulberg\
  \ in a mall next to the Macdonald and also in the Liberty market.\n\nMy company\
  \ rented a car from Travel Walji with a driver. Some drivers are good and some are\
  \ not that good. SO I had to ask for a change of driver at one point as the existing\
  \ driver was driving quite badly.\n\nInitially I was planning to stay in Hotel Melrose\
  \ Inn, they promptly responded to my emails. But my company decided to pay for my\
  \ hotel and booked as at Avary Hotel, which was nice.\n\nIslamabad: Drive from Lahore\
  \ to Islamabad was great. Eight lane highways, very smooth with rest stops were\
  \ excellent. It took 4 and half hour to reach Islamabad with a rest stop. We stayed\
  \ at Serena Hotel. This is the best hotel in Pakistan with great ambience and service.\
  \ Security was extremely tight, makes people feel uneasy at times. Food was great\
  \ but had no time to check out the pool or sauna. We went to see the King Faisal\
  \ mosque, then to Shakarparian to see the Pakistan Monument. Both were gorgeous.\
  \ At night, we had dinner at Restaurant 1969 in Shakarparian with friends. There\
  \ were few Americans in the restaurant as well. Despite all the security scares,\
  \ people were having fun too.\n\nNext morning, we took a PIA flight to Karachi.\
  \ Plane left on time, service was ok.\n\nKarachi: Karachi airport is quite nice,\
  \ recently built. Arrival was hassle free, was transferred to Sheraton Karachi hotel.\
  \ We were given a suite in the old wing. Did not like the suite as it was quite\
  \ old with worn out furniture and damp smell.\n\nWe visited the monument of Quaid\
  \ Azam, then visited the Clifton beach. We had diiner at Student\u2019s biriyani.\
  \ Karachi has no security scare but all the secuirity checks were in place at the\
  \ hotel entrance. We went to Gulf shopping mall in Tin Talwar (3 sword) area for\
  \ shopping. Also visited the Park mall and \u201CGeneration\u201D boutique store\
  \ at Clifton area. Bought some nuts from old Karachi town area and had breakfast\
  \ in one of the whole in the wall shop at Burns road. My friend bought some sweets\
  \ for my from \u201CDilpasand\u201D sweet store. On our way back, arrived at the\
  \ airport about 2 1/2 hour before flight time to ensure smooth check in.\n\nOverall,\
  \ we enjoyed our trip to Pakistan very much. The food was great, the shopping was\
  \ excellent. If the security situation gets better, we will go back to visit Peshawar."
