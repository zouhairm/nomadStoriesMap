Text: "In March of 2018 me qnd my friend Nastya were young and hungry for adventures.\
  \ Then we decided to go to Amsterdam - city of freedom.\n\nFirst city in Netherlands\
  \ was Eindhoven. While we were expecting \"perfect Europe\" we idealised it too\
  \ much (i guess), so when we found q lot of garbage right on the street we felt\
  \ disappointed.\n\nBut we have gone through. Next stop was Hertogenbosch. The city\
  \ were lived our couchsurfing host. There we felt like we're already close to the\
  \ Amsterdam. City lights, coffeeshops and totally different people.\n\nNext morning\
  \ we were in Amsterdam. City of freedom, tolerance and legalization. City with millions\
  \ of stories and hundreds of cyclist's. When the night came out we have gone for\
  \ a walk. At first sight it was a total party city, but then we noticed that only\
  \ at one street. \n\nWe were really part shoked and part disaappointed, but the\
  \ capital of hard parties was just a normal city. With the same streets, with ordinary\
  \ people which live their ordinary life.\n\nAs it was one of the first trips we\
  \ were kinda shoked and when we shared it in Lublin our klhost told us \"it is better\
  \ to have no expectations. Always\""
