Text: "When I was at the college I worked for a local sports newspaper here in Rome\
  \ and I had the possibility to travel by train all along the centre of Italy in\
  \ order to comment some amateur football matches of the weekend. I did it for several\
  \ years. At the beginning, I lived my train travels on my own: I slept, I listened\
  \ to the music with my earphones and I looked often outside the window mixing up\
  \ my thoughts with the hits of my Spotify playlists. But as time goes by, I started\
  \ to look inside the train and I noticed something really interesting. In a single\
  \ train car you can see many different kinds of people: families, young couples,\
  \ business men, workers, tourists and obviously some lomesone travelers like me.\
  \ Those people all have their personal story and their specific peculiarities. I\
  \ didn't expect to find this huge variety of \"characters\" in such a tight space,\
  \ it was really a miniature of the humanity. Among all this people coming and going\
  \ there have been a few stories of which I have been fortunately a witness. Once\
  \ I saw a girl crying and discussing at the phone with her boyfriend and then, a\
  \ few hours later, I saw the same girl laughing and joking after she made peace\
  \ with him. The following weekend I spotted a girl who was probably preparing a\
  \ job interview. She was speaking to herself, trying to calm down, but she seemed\
  \ very anxious. I hope her interview went well. Another time I travelled next to\
  \ a young couple, she was pregnant and they spent all the trip discussing about\
  \ which name would have been the best for their future son. Once they noticed that\
  \ I was listening to the conversation they asked me which one was my favourite.\
  \ I said \"Luca\", of course. It was very funny. However, the story to which I am\
  \ more attached is the following. \n\nA few years ago I was on the train from Rome\
  \ to Milan and I saw this scene: a 30/35 year old man approached a woman (probably\
  \ younger than him) sitting in front of him. She was reading a book and the man\
  \ started to tell her how deep and moving he found that novel. Then, they began\
  \ to talk about their lives, their jobs and their personal taste. After almost ten\
  \ minutes, the man sat beside her and they continued to chat merrily. I watch them\
  \ for a long  time and I was really impressed by their empathy. The way they laughed,\
  \ the way they looked each other into the eyes was amazing. They were nothing but\
  \ strangers an hour before, but they acted like they have know each other for a\
  \ lifetime. I felt like I was in front of the beginning of a new love story, but\
  \ I could not have imagined what happened a few moments later. We were close to\
  \ the arrival at Milan train station when they suddendly stopped talking, they looked\
  \ one another intensively and then, after many seconds of silence, they kissed each\
  \ other. Once we arrived in Milan they got off the train together and they walked\
  \ out of the station hand in hand. I thought this scenes only to happen in romantic\
  \ films, but sometimes reality is better than the fiction."
