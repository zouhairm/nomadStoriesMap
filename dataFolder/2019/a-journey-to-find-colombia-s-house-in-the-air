Text: "I spent the better half of the night drenched in sweat letting vivid imaginations\
  \ of my anxious mind run wild. Ten fellow travelers, many of whom were on their\
  \ first trip abroad, had trusted in me to guide them through rural Colombia. Opting\
  \ out of the busy tourist hubs of Medellin, Cartenaga, and Bogota, we set our sights\
  \ on Bucaramanga and Chicamocha National Park, a rural and mountainous region of\
  \ Eastern Colombia. \n\nThe story begins in a rock climbing gym on Michigan's west\
  \ coast in early winter. A handful of us spent our usual afternoon working on varies\
  \ bouldering problems, often taking long breaks to swap stories among coffee and\
  \ snacks. Max, a young climbing friend, voiced interest in taking his first trip\
  \ abroad. \n\n\"You commit and I'll make it happen,\" I said. \n\nColombia was a\
  \ top contender based on its affordability and diverse landscapes. My experience\
  \ navigating thirty-some countries installed confidence in Max to trust in this\
  \ unknown journey. We needed six people to commit to the trip to maximize affordability\
  \ within the group. Knowing how intensely tricky it had been to get a handful of\
  \ adventurous friends to commit to a weekend away in Northern Michigan, a light\
  \ and airy dream was quickly replaced by a heavy weight on my shoulders to meet\
  \ our personal quota. \n\nThree months later, an astounding eleven tickets were\
  \ booked. Among them, over half had never been out of North America. A giddy excitement\
  \ came over me. Even my older brother, a man of endless dreams with minimal commitment,\
  \ booked a ticket.\n\nHowever, in the days leading toward departure, I began to\
  \ feel the magnitude of our (my) ambitious planning. Beyond our first night in the\
  \ small city of Bucaramanga, our group fell in love with a 17-sleeper mansion perched\
  \ on a cliff 4500ft above the floor of Chicamocha National Park. The expansive estate\
  \ reminded us of something found high in the California hills, except this slice\
  \ of luxury in the middle of Colombia's Yosemite dented our pockets by a mere $11\
  \ a night.\n\nThe week leading up to the trip included a bombardment of emails/texts/messages\
  \ from me to the group asking for a consensus if they wanted to rent three cars\
  \ for five days or attempt to taxi over two hours into Colombian high-country. The\
  \ frantic begging proved to no avail, as on the second morning of our trip we were\
  \ standing in the common room of our hostel (where we were the only guests), still\
  \ undecided of our next step. \n\nAfter some abrasive decision making, two hours\
  \ later we packed ourselves into two taxies and one illegal Uber outside a grocery\
  \ store. Bags of eggs, pasta, and beer spilled over our laps and piled to the ceiling\
  \ of each small compact car. Grocery shopping from our mountain oasis included riding\
  \ in the back of a farmers truck to the nearest bus stop, followed by over an hour\
  \ of bussing through rough and uneven terrain to Los Santos, a tiny mountain town\
  \ of 12,000. \n\nWe had one final hurdle, which proved quite a feat. Our house,\
  \ aptly named La Casa en El Air, had no exact address. This wasn't uncommon in rural\
  \ Colombia but led to our three taxies chasing a red dot on a pre-loaded map like\
  \ an ill-fated treasure hunt. Our stomachs churned as we sped up steep mountainsides,\
  \ veering past recent mudslides that often blocked half the road. After nearly three\
  \ hours, the world opened. In front of us, a large white mansion, perfectly perched\
  \ above a valley that stretched for miles in every direction. We had arrived, but\
  \ one taxi was missing. Roughly two hours later, the engine sputtered down the driveway\
  \ with the last three members of the group, defeated after failing to find the house\
  \ and traveling off-course for nearly an hour.\n\nFinally all together at our destination,\
  \ I let out a deep exhale. We had made it. Eleven of us stood on our deck taking\
  \ in the view, each with a feeling of pride after successfully managing to navigate\
  \ Colombia with basic Spanish and minimal resources. I cracked a local cold brew,\
  \ proud of me and proud of us \u2014 an adventure of a lifetime awaits."
