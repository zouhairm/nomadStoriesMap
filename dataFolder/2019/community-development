Text: 'There is serious need for sustainable community development, considering the
  fact that crude oil producing communities in Bayelsa state have been neglected by
  both the government and the multinational corporations operating is these areas.
  Some communities visited are lacking behind the set Sustainable Development Goals
  (SDG''s), because of massive corruption going on in the extractive industry. As
  host communities to International oil companies (MNC''s), the term "International
  Best Standards" is supposed to be the label or sign post in these communities, but
  rather what we see is devastated communities with uncleaned pollution''s from pipelines
  and illegal refining of crude oil popularly called "KPO FIRE" that have massively
  destroyed sources of living for community that relied fully on the produce of their
  farmlands, creeks and ponds for food. The government have so much excuses to give
  why sustainability of local communities is a problem, but with the intervention
  of the oil companies who really understand the negative impacts from oil exploration
  on the  community if standards are not taken into considerations....i wonder what
  the excuses will be .....because collectively these communities are too small to
  be kept on a sustainable developed state.

  Illegal refinery is as a result of lack of employment for the youths. Graduates
  are roaming about in the communities as the companies will to grant them employment,
  permanent/contract or even temporary . it is a pathetic situation in these communities.
  The rights of these communities have been infringed upon...we are preaching for
  considerations from the international communities to come out to the aids of these
  marginalized communities....dont allow what is suppose to be a blessing to be converted
  into a curse by some greedy individuals at the detriment of many.'
