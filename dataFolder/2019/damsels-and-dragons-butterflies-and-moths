Text: "An excerpt from walking the SW west Coast path of England.\n\nThere is no single\
  \ Cornwall to write about nor a single time period. From July 20 till September\
  \ 10, English children are on vacation so the families arrive for their bucket and\
  \ shovel, paddle and surfboard, bathing and wet suit, sunburn and tattoo vacations.\
  \ Time is divided between school-in and school-out. From July 1 to July 19 school\
  \ is in and it is a quiet time. After that, it is school-out and anything but quiet.\
  \ \n\nThere is no single landscape to write about. We pass through tropical and\
  \ sub-tropical, grazing and farm lands, bogs and wind-swept flats, sand dunes and\
  \ beaches, green and rocky cliffs, flower-lined streams and picturesque waterfalls.\
  \ We hug cliff sides and climb up and down steep hills. Trails have reopened after\
  \ major rockslides, giving us the opportunity to practice our bouldering -- a skill\
  \ I could have personally lived a lifetime without. After portions of the trail\
  \ fell  (or as the English say, the land slipped as though there was a banana peel\
  \ involved), we are re-routed into pastures, pastures with my nemesis cows, sigh,\
  \ yes, cows.\n\nWe pass through villages famous for their famous chefs or famous\
  \ for TV and movies, or famous for their surf or not famous at all. We pass through\
  \ villages with pubs and churches dating back to the 1400s and towns dating back\
  \ to last week. There are surf beaches and family beaches. There are elitist sailing\
  \ harbors and working fishermen's harbors. There are family-friendly villages with\
  \ affordable chippies, pasties, clotted cream ice cream and of course, the oddly-named\
  \ family-friendly pub. There are villages popular with couples with romantic restaurants\
  \ and distinctly un-family-friendly pubs -- in fact, they even mix very un-family-friendly\
  \ cocktails. There are villages popular with clubbers who barely realize they are\
  \ near the sea. The towns have delicious seafood or nothing more than fish and chips\
  \ with that mystery concoction of mushy peas. A beach town, only two miles up the\
  \ road from a harbor town, has almost no fish because all the fish are apparently\
  \ in the towns with harbors. Most villages have cider and some even have cider\u2019\
  s roughneck relative, scrumpy. \n\nBut there is two constants throughout Cornwall.\
  \ The Damsels and Dragons, Butterflies and Moths that dance around us like phantom\
  \ sprites. Blue-green translucent single and double winged Damselflies and Dragonflies\
  \ appear and disappear. Did we even see these wisps of color darting across our\
  \ path? The glowing red Burnet moth challenges the commander wing-stripes of Admiral\
  \ butterflies for our attention. These are not the dull clothes moths I tried to\
  \ protect my closets against before I left. Our path is a superhighway of motion.\
  \ Sometimes a butterfly alights on a flower long enough to let us know what we are\
  \ missing. \n\n\nThe other constant companion is the Atlantic with waves arriving\
  \ in a steady rhythm to white sandy beaches or rock formations of long narrow stones.\
  \ The sound is a continual and soothing whoosh whoosh. On the beaches the sun worshippers\
  \ set up their chairs, umbrellas and colorful windbreaks according to the tide charts\
  \ not the available beach since at high tide the beach will be less than one fourth\
  \ of the beach at low tide. In the harbors, boats lie stranded in the mud. There\
  \ is something forlorn about dozens of boats leaning this way and that as they wait\
  \ for the seas to return and put them upright again, much like a child's basket\
  \ of forgotten toys. \n\nAfter five weeks, 430 miles, I am finished, and a bit sad\
  \ to no longer wake every day to the challenge of the walk and new discoveries along\
  \ the way but more than that, the sense of awe -- of damsels and dragons, butterflies\
  \ and moths, of flowers and foliage and their changes from buds to blooms to seeds\
  \ and fruit, of the sea in all its marvelous sounds and colors, of the trail itself.\
  \ \n\nWhy do I walk? I walk for the damsels and dragons, butterflies and moths and\
  \ the pleasure of awe."
