Text: "People passed by in front of me. They are local residents also my neighbors\
  \ that were evacuated here, on the second floor of Langgar Mosque few days ago.\
  \ We are now waiting for the flood to recede, might spent weeks. We live together,\
  \ for now, it\u2019s the third day, never forget to count it every day. Charities\
  \ never stop coming to help us, we cook and eat together. This place goes into the\
  \ area known as the Old City, located in West Jakarta. Known as that because the\
  \ former Dutch colonial buildings were still standing up to the present, including\
  \ the largest railway station building here. This mosque was also established in\
  \ the same period. Langgar Tinggi mosque is one of few mosques here. The hundred\
  \ years European, Chinese, and Javanese architecture building still standing firmly\
  \ all alone not putrified by time.\n\nI still remember every word that Aba told\
  \ me. When he was a teenager, he could walk with his hands while his legs floated\
  \ on the ceiling. He walked with both hands from his house to the large mosque at\
  \ the fork in the road, approximately 200 meters. People here have known Aba and\
  \ his family quite well, obviously because his big house had been lived by more\
  \ than 3 generations.\n\n8 years after his marriage, not far from the house left\
  \ by his parents, Aba moved to the smaller house and it\u2019s below Langgar mosque.\
  \ At that time I was only 5 years old. We lived at the third of four houses. Previously,\
  \ each house was used to study for kids and teenagers around this village, but along\
  \ the time has changed, some teachers died, some moved. Since then, no one is taking\
  \ care, the houses were just empty until they are used as waqf houses, anyone who\
  \ needs them can occupy.\n\n\u201CThis river was wider than it is now, the water\
  \ was clean, there were lots of fish. I even could be fishing. Watercraft passed\
  \ every day, not as you see now, it\u2019s smaller, it narrows, the color is sometimes\
  \ dark green or black, full of garbage until now we are displaced because of flooding.\u201D\
  \ He recalls while staring at the river that has been merged with the highway behind\
  \ this building. Water drowns all of his hometown as high as 70cm. From the balcony,\
  \ in front of the second floor of the Langgar Mosque, I could see how people down\
  \ there were walking slowly against the water that covering their feet.\n\n\"After\
  \ entering college, you will live in a dormitory, focus studying there,\" Aba said\
  \ while looking at the bright sky behind a dark brown wood-fenced window inside\
  \ Langgar Mosque. The fact is we do not even know which college will accept me.\
  \ I think Aba wants a better life for me. Religious education in the East that he\
  \ did not achieve due to her parents' requests to work, made him support me to study\
  \ as much as I want.\n\nThat was the last yearly flood that I spent to be refugees\
  \ with Aba. It\u2019s 7 years ago. Aba died before he founds out I was accepted\
  \ in a most favorite University in this country. I lived in a dormitory. After graduation,\
  \ I moved and leave Aba's hometown. The flood-plagued that city once after the lasts\
  \ time. After that, the floods no longer came. The river becomes cleaner. The water\
  \ parks above Old City\u2019s river also has been built, the old buildings are reactivated\
  \ into shops as well as restaurants."
