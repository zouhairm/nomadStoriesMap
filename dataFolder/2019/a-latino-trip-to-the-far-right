Text: "\u201CI am sure that they even eat people down there\u201D, a friend warned\
  \ me, very seriously.  I was an exchange student back then in 2015 at the Hamburg\
  \ University of Technology, pursuing a career in robotics.  Naturally I got very\
  \ excited when a major company offered me an intern opportunity for doing extremely\
  \ nerdy stuff.  Excitement that everybody seemed to share until I told them where\
  \ was that job located:  Chemnitz, Saxony;  According to them, the last bastion\
  \ of the harmful ideas that the Germans desperately try to leave behind.      \n\
  \nMy drive to take the opportunity did not diminish nor the tiniest bit, it actually\
  \ increased.  After all, my homeland, Colombia, carries a very heavy burden of prejudices\
  \ too.  It was my chance to prove to a lot of people what Chemnitz, and I, were\
  \ really about. \n\nThe day came.  First I took a very fancy high-speed train from\
  \ Hamburg to Berlin; then transferred to a slower, yet comfy, train to Leipzig;\
  \ where finally I took my last ride: a very different, visibly old, diesel train\
  \ to Chemnitz.  Most people would have considered my journey as a metaphor of what\
  \ was about to happen to my life\u2026  I did not.   \n\nThat way I came to a city\
  \ full of monolithic and mostly dark-colored buildings, with some really wide streets\
  \ and renewed old factories every now and then.  And, as if that was not enough\
  \ to create the perfect soviet-like ambience, I ran across a 13 meters-tall, grey,\
  \ metallic Karl Marx\u2019s head.  At that point I realised that a 5 hours ride\
  \ was enough to get someone into the cold war.       \n\nFully aware that I was\
  \ in a very different place than used to, I headed to the job with all my best intercultural\
  \ communication tools in handy.  My surprise was, I was not going to need them.\
  \  Those people were practically German-speaking latinos.  \n\nThrough my stay and\
  \ journeys across Europe, nobody had made me feel more welcome than those guys did.\
  \  They introduced me to their customs, their delicious food, some incredibly good\
  \ beer and their beautiful women (wink wink). \n\nBut fairy tales are not good if\
  \ they lack of a dramatic climax, mine came when I got accidentally trapped in the\
  \ middle of a far-right-wing political demonstration. It was me, surrounded by approximately\
  \ 15 policemen, surrounded themselves by hundreds of protesters that clearly did\
  \ not wanted me there.  \n\nDespite the stressful situation, my focus was never\
  \ on the protesters that were yelling the hell out of their souls, but on a police\
  \ woman that stayed all the time by my side and kept saying: \u201CThe problem is\
  \ not with you, you are going to be ok\u201D\u2026  What problem?  Whom is that\
  \ problem with?  What in this world does PEGIDA mean?  Was that what everybody was\
  \ afraid of?\u2026  I kind of got obsessed with those questions, so naturally I\
  \ needed answers.  \n\nThe next day I was scolded by my friends and co-workers,\
  \ even though I just wanted to go to the city center for a haircut, not getting\
  \ into a hate demonstration.  After all the worries and security tips, someone invited\
  \ me to another event, just to \u201Csee that not everyone in the city is like that\u201D\
  .  I was extremely thankful for the invitation because well, that was what I was\
  \ trying to prove since I first got there.\n\nSo I went to a concert for people\
  \ promoting tolerance and open-mindedness.  The city center was so full of people\
  \ that it was hard to spot the giant Karl Marx, and trust me, missing that is hard.\
  \  The event gathered thousands of people, way more than the PEGIDA demonstration.\
  \  We sang, we had fun, we left a message. \n\nSome years later, in 2018, back in\
  \ Colombia, I needed to select a university to study my Master.  My decision was\
  \ obvious: I was coming back to the fun, the food, the beer and Marx\u2019s strangely\
  \ giant head.  My family were still worrying because of a new far-right political\
  \ movement that was beginning in the area, but I told them:  \u201CDon\u2019t worry,\
  \ it\u2019s not like they ate people over there\u201D."
