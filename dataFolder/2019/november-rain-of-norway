Text: "Coming from a country that lies in the equator has giving me a very broad perspective\
  \ of how this trip has enlighten me. Not just how difference the weather was but\
  \ also, the sun is not always shine at the same amount of time. When I was there\
  \ in November, the sun only shines for 4 hours. It rise around 10 in the morning\
  \ and set around 2 in the afternoon. And yes, I wasn't prepare for this. I understand\
  \ that I will find a very cold weather and maybe snow, but the limited amount of\
  \ sun? That doesn't sound like a good time for traveling.\n\nWhat can I say? The\
  \ show must go on. I remember all the brochure and website that I've seen is all\
  \ beautiful and sunny, but then I realize it's all taken in a different sets of\
  \ season, which we all know which season is that. So if you're into outdoor activity,\
  \ November is definitely not a good weather to visit Norway. I remember visiting\
  \ Fisherman Village Museum in \xC5 around 1 o'clock. I still can see the sun when\
  \ I'm going in. When I go out, it's dark and rainy already. I thought it was 9 o'clock\
  \ at night considering there's not much people around. Even though that this is\
  \ a good season for northern light, but to be honest with all the rain and haze,\
  \ you just have to work hard enough to catch them. \n\nMy adventure in Norway starts\
  \ in one of the most populous region far north, Troms\xF8. My reason for this part\
  \ of the region is for the Northern light. Because the further north you go, the\
  \ better you get the chance to see it. Also Troms\xF8 has a very interesting touristic\
  \ site and public transport that you can use if you're a solo traveller like me.\
  \ Renting a car for yourself is quite expensive but if you have the budget and brave\
  \ enough to drive, there's plenty of secluded spot that you can visit. You can do\
  \ a whale or deer hunting (in terms of picture). In my visit to this beautiful place\
  \ I was so unlucky because it was raining in 2 days out of 3 days trip. So I end\
  \ up decided to do an indoor activity which is going to the University of Troms\xF8\
  \ to see the history of northern light on day one and going for a whale hunting\
  \ on day two. Because of a constant rain on that day, we're not so lucky to find\
  \ any whale. But, we're lucky enough to enjoy a traditional waffle lunch provided\
  \ by the blow glass artist which lives near one of the biggest fjord in Troms\xF8\
  . On day three, I got lucky again. The next door guy that I rent place at airbnb\
  \ is kind enough to show me around the places I stay. It's 30 mins from Troms\xF8\
  \ city centre called Kval\xF8ya. Near that place there's a frozen lake which you\
  \ can skate on - if you're up for it. In my case, since it's my first frozen lake,\
  \ I'm lucky enough that I didn't fall on the slippery ice. \n\nNext destination\
  \ is Reine. Yes, that beautiful place surely look as beautiful as the postcard in\
  \ the clear weather. But when it covers with fog, well at least you still get the\
  \ serene feeling about it. The whole trip to Reine is actually famous area called\
  \ Lofoten Island. It's known for their distinctive scenery of mountains and peaks.\
  \ To be honest I didn't realize that it was an island because it only take a bus\
  \ from Troms\xF8 to get here. When I have to take the plane or ferry to one of the\
  \ airport in order to connect me to Oslo,  I just realize that the route is connected\
  \ from island to island. Too bad it was dark during the scenic road trip by bus.\
  \ If I visit it during the midnight sun, I'll bet I would manage to see the whole\
  \ beautiful view along the road."
