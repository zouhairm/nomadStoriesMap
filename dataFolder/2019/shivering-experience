Text: "I didn\u2019t expect to come face to face with death \u2026 and totally not\
  \ realize it. \n\nI spent two months in Bogota, Colombia. Before I left everyone\
  \ was scared for my safety, which I understood and deep down I was a bit but, I\
  \ figured I couldn\u2019t judge Colombia before I went there. Overall my experience\
  \ was great. No one stole from me, I wasn\u2019t physically hurt or scared for my\
  \ safety. \n\nAlthough, one night as me and some of my friends are walking back\
  \ from dinner to our apartment some guy pulls a knife on 2 of my friends. Me and\
  \ the other girls were walking a few feet behind our two guy friends, and next thing\
  \ we know (probably should say she knows because I personally didn\u2019t see it)\
  \ this guy takes a knife out and demands they give him money, in Spanish, of course.\
  \ Sam simply says no and kept walking and next thing you know the guy leaves. Now\
  \ during all this, I am completely oblivious to it, which was probably good because\
  \ I definitely don\u2019t know how I would have reacted on the spot. \n\nWhen we\
  \ got back and told the rest of our friends the story, I finally got to hear it\
  \ from their point of view, which was great because my point of view was boring\
  \ and uneventful. I think out of all their points of view, my favourite was Charlotte\u2019\
  s, who was walking beside me.\n\nThe way she described the \u201Cexperience\u201D\
  \ goes as so: \n\u201CWe were walking and all of a sudden a guy approaches two of\
  \ our friends in front of us and he pulls out this small shiv, tries to rob them\
  \ with no success. I mean if you\u2019re going to rob someone at least commit to\
  \ it!\u201D \u2014 Charlotte.\n\nOverall, Colombia was a great country to visit.\
  \ I would definitely return and hope this story didn\u2019t discourage you to visit\
  \ it."
