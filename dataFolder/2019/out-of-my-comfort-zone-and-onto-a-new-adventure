Text: "If someone were to ask me what my most life changing experience was in my twenty-four\
  \ years of life, moving to Australia for six months would be the first thought to\
  \ come to mind.  Being a new college graduate, who had done little traveling outside\
  \ of the country, this was a big decision. I would be living with a brand new family\
  \ as an au pair, knowing no one and being away from everything that I had known.\
  \ This turned out to be quite an adventure but a learning experience as well. I\
  \ was blessed with getting to spend my Monday-Fridays with two amazing kiddo's,\
  \ planning fun activities for us, having picnics, going to the beach, and learning\
  \ about them, as they learned about me. On the weekends I would explore the country.\
  \ There were many weekends spent in Sydney, one in Melbourne and a few in cute,\
  \ random towns outside of Sydney. I threw myself out of my comfort many times, skydiving\
  \ on the beach was definitely something I wouldn't have seen myself doing 5 years\
  \ ago. Camping on a random beach with 4 other people I barely knew was a great experience\
  \ as well. We all came from different countries and would share stories from our\
  \ home towns and our au pair experience so far, while sharing marshmallows and boxed\
  \ wine. I learned that Australian people eat Kangaroo and called \"bell peppers\"\
  , capsicum. So, I gave kangaroo a try (even though I felt a little guilty about\
  \ it) and started speaking the way that the locals do. Through some of these experiences\
  \ I learned that I will try almost any new experience, once and that there is so\
  \ much about the world that I don't know, just from seeing one country. \n     \n\
  From these experiences, I started a short blog. I wrote one about the crazy desserts\
  \ in the different parts of Australia that I had tried. I also wrote one blog about\
  \ tips for moving to a new country. This included, what to bring, how to prepare\
  \ physically and mentally being away from what you had known and a few things that\
  \ I had learned along the way. Traveling has inspired me so much and my love of\
  \ working with children, that I now find myself teaching English in South Korea.\
  \ My time in Australia triggered this curiosity in me to keep seeing the world,\
  \ learning about different people and cultures, while doing what I love and helping\
  \ children."
