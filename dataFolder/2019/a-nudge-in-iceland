Text: "The snow crunching underneath our boots became more apparent the farther we\
  \ got from the bus. Underneath the glittering Icelandic sky my companions and I\
  \ trekked the plateau, a flask of cheap whiskey tucked in my breast pocket. Green\
  \ ribbons above moved like slow-motion octopus tentacles, illuminating the surrounding\
  \ cliffs with an ethereal and ghastly glow. The Northern Lights, contrary to popular\
  \ media, are green and look more like a gaseous jelly to the naked eye. We learned\
  \ two days prior that it is because human eyes can't adjust to the frequencies transmitted\
  \ by the deflected solar flare.\n\nWe were told this so we would not get disappointed.\n\
  \nBut how can one get disappointed when the headlights of the bus fade and leave\
  \ the lot of us underneath all the stars in the world? How can one be disappointed\
  \ when a ribbon dances in the night sky next to Orion\u2019s Belt and the Dippers,\
  \ its form longer than even the tallest person\u2019s wingspan? The Northern Lights\
  \ are a force beyond us; the Earth\u2019s last line of defense against solar strikes\
  \ which will inevitably doom us to oblivion. It is a testament of our relationship\
  \ to the Earth, of how naturally beautiful and miraculous an invisible field over\
  \ our small little rock can be. It makes one wonder how we, as a race, got so darn\
  \ lucky and that if our planet was not strong enough, we would be screwed. \n\n\
  It is easy to feel so insignificant while coming as close to the sun in such a frigid\
  \ environment. Underneath a sky with more stars than black, resistant to the corrosion\
  \ of light pollution that I have gone accustomed to from my Brooklyn window, it\
  \ is the first reaction to feel minimized by the presence of those green, dancing\
  \ ribbons. I get it. I felt that way at first as did my colleagues on our return\
  \ to the hostel. But when I looked up at those lights, moving in slow motion and\
  \ spanning across my entire vision, I wondered how anyone could ever remain so cynical.\
  \ To me, the Northern Lights are the slight nudge in any adventurer\u2019s story\
  \ that perhaps all the myths, stories, and legends of magic are true."
