Text: "Nothing compares to the thrill of exploring somewhere new and having the adventure\
  \ of a lifetime.\nPortugal has become hugely popular among European tourists- with\
  \ beautiful beaches, great\nnightlife and lots of sun to soak up it\u2019s not hard\
  \ to see why. If you\u2019re looking for a more adventurous\nbreak, you won\u2019\
  t be disappointed. So, grab your new wetsuit and head to Portugal as soon as\npossible!\n\
  \nSurfing\n\nPortugal is famous for its long sandy beaches, but did you know that\
  \ you can also find the perfect\nsurfing conditions on the Silver Coast? Whether\
  \ you\u2019re a beginner taking your first wobbly steps on\nthe board, or have years\u2019\
  \ of experience carving through the waves, you\u2019ll find surfing conditions to\n\
  suit all year round. There are plenty of schools for beginners to give the sport\
  \ a go under supervision\nand you\u2019ll find a welcoming surfing community on\
  \ the most popular beaches, such as Peniche\nPortugal.\n\nScuba Diving\n\nThe coastline\
  \ of the Algarve is arguably one of the most popular and busy parts of Portugal.\
  \ This\ndoesn\u2019t mean there is a lack of secluded spots and natural beauty to\
  \ see though. In fact, the ocean\nhere is rich with sea life. On a good day, you\u2019\
  ll find everything from octopus to sea turtles. There are\nplenty of dives for beginners\
  \ but, if you\u2019re serious about the sport, you can choose to complete a\ncourse\
  \ to become PADI qualified. The cost of the 1-2 day courses average at around \u20AC\
  300.\n\nHorse Riding\n\nLusitano horses are famous in Portugal due to their long\
  \ history in the country. Visitors can ride on\nthe back of one along the incredible\
  \ Costa Azul, in the south of the country. The trail runs for miles,\nthrough pine\
  \ forests and alongside beautiful blue lagoons. You\u2019ll be far away from the\
  \ crowds here,\nmaking it a great way to enjoy the remote and untouched sandy beaches\
  \ and flower-filled fields.\nMost visitors agree that horse riding is an unmissable\
  \ way to explore the more remote areas of\nPortugal.\n\nCycling\n\nIf you\u2019\
  re not confident on horseback, hit one of the many cycling trails instead. You can\
  \ go alone or\nwith a guided tour, there are even eight-day long routes which for\
  \ real adventure seekers!\nRegardless of how far you choose to cycle, you\u2019\
  re sure to stumble upon some beautiful Portuguese\nscenery. Beyond the beaches and\
  \ sand dunes, you\u2019ll find lighthouses and marinas where the fishing\nboats\
  \ moor up.\n\nHiking\n\nAway from the coast, Portugal has some stunning forests\
  \ and mountainous landscapes. Be sure to\nvisit one of the many parks and take a\
  \ hike to see some stunning views across Portugal. Remember,\nin summer temperatures\
  \ reach around 25\xB0C, so walking can be challenging for even the fittest of\n\
  people if you\u2019re not used to it. However, the rewards are well worth it. The\
  \ Auroca Geopark in Arouca is the perfect place for a hike. The Paiva Pathways are\
  \ routes which follow the Paiva River for over 8km, through forests and past sites\
  \ of historic interest."
