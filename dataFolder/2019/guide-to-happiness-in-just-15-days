Text: "I was a lonely kid, never had many friends or many adventures.\nI was the classical\
  \ \"good boy\" who lived a complex childhood and grew up alone in his room doing\
  \ homework for the next day. I never cared much about finding a girl or hanging\
  \ out with friends during the weekend, I had everything I was needing. But the 16\
  \ of July 2015 something changed, I had my first \"solo trip\" in the UK. Everything\
  \ started when an old family friend invited me to a study-trip with lots of other\
  \ teens set in Egham at the beautiful Royal Holloway college.\nWhen I accept this\
  \ offer my life was quite difficult, but I had enough money to pay this one travel.\
  \ What I was not knowing was the fact that this trip changed my life in many ways.\n\
  Like I said before I never had many experiences as a teen and I think that from\
  \ a psychological point of view what I lived in the UK  started many processes that\
  \ change me and my nature for the rest of my days.\nWhen i arrived with the group\
  \ at the Heathrow Airport, we lived one of the most beautiful moments of our life,\
  \ we saw by the window of the plane an incredible sunset.\nIt was so much different\
  \ from the typical sunset that we saw for all our lives, my heart was beating like\
  \ an African Voodoo Drum.\nA perfect welcome. \nThe next day we lived a typical\
  \ college day we ate all together and start knowing each other, we visited the college\
  \ and the city.\nAt the end of that first day, there were already factions inside\
  \ our group.\nI found a faction on my own with an already set leader, the daughter\
  \ of the teacher that was accompanying us, she was sort of charismatic and very\
  \ manipulative, never liked her.\nI start watching around while presenting myself\
  \ to the group and then I saw her, one of the most beautiful human beings that ever\
  \ walked in front of my eyes.\nI was shaking and my heart was exploding.\nShe was\
  \ perfect: curly brown hair with blond locks, green eyes, and the most beautiful\
  \ smile ever existed.\nHer name is Gaia and she was my first love.\nIn the same\
  \ faction, there was this guy called Gabriele and he felled in love too with Gaia\
  \ the same day, I start hating him and I even called him Don Giovanni as an insult,\
  \ at the end of the trip we became best friends. \nThe next day we went to London\
  \ and I saw in just one look The London Eye, the Thames, and Big Ben. Just 3 hours\
  \ later I was at the top of the Lond Eye while taking with Gaia, loving her every\
  \ moment a bit more.\nDuring the next days we returned a few times in London seeing\
  \ some beautiful places, we visited other incredible cities like Brighton, Oxford,\
  \ Cambridge and many many more.\nDuring this study trip, we obviously studied and\
  \ this was also an incredible experience.\nMy class was formed by persons from every\
  \ part of the world: there were people from Kazakhstan, Russia, Spain, Nigeria,\
  \ Greece and lots more, we interact in such different ways, with different accents\
  \ and cultures background, but at the same time, we were so much similar.\nThere\
  \ I understand that sometimes humans are not so different \nThe most beautiful moment\
  \ of my life was on this trip at the Farewell Party.\nA disco inside a boat on the\
  \ Thames during the sunshine going to the Tower Bridge. (Never enjoyed much disco)\n\
  I can clearly see in my memory the moment where the Sun was between the 2 towers,\
  \ while teens from all over the world were dancing, I took Gaia with me and I kissed\
  \ her.\nDuring this adventure I fell in love, I understand friendship and what being\
  \ alive and happy means.\nIt changed my way of seeing life, in just 15 days I start\
  \ being a different human being.\nTraveling change always your way of seeing the\
  \ world.\nAnd if you change in something better, maybe you should try to change\
  \ the world."
