Text: "Beads of morning-dew conjured on the blades of the grass as I walked into the\
  \ entrance of Rajesh\u2019s farmhouse in Hampi.\n\nHis two ferocious Golden-Retrievers\
  \ barked at me as eyes popped out of their sockets. I was an intruder in their territory.\
  \ And they didn\u2019t like it. They were ready to break their chains and charge\
  \ at me. Scared that I am of all dogs, chained or open, I was about to turn away\
  \ from the idea of staying in Rajesh\u2019s \u2018Couchsurfing\u2019 home. Better\
  \ be away from dogs than staying for free.\n\n\u201CCome, Come!\u201D a man said,\
  \ appearing out of the house, \u201CThey not bite. Yash right? Welcome in my home!\u201D\
  \ Rajesh was heftier than his photo revealed on the Couchsurfing website.\n\nI walked\
  \ into the courtyard and the dogs grew more hysteric as did the pounding in my heart.\
  \ Rajesh howled at them with large eyes: \u201CAyyyyy Salttt! Pepper!\u201D\n\n\
  The two demons subsided into licking their body-parts, and gave up on me.\n\nThe\
  \ last day, I stepped into the dark sanctum-sanctorum of Kadalekalu-Ganesha temple.\
  \ The tall idol of Elephant-God towered above me like a sleeping ghost. In 1509,\
  \ Krishnaraja had built this temple as a monument-of-victory after defeating the\
  \ Bijapur Sultanate. Years later, when the Sultanate sacked the city of Hampi, the\
  \ attacking army chiselled away a deep cut on the rotund belly of Ganesha as a sign\
  \ of revenge. It is amusing, I thought, how monuments first symbolize the military\
  \ victories, and then face the wrath of fighting kingdoms. The city of Hampi had\
  \ burnt for months, leaving nothing but ashed roofs and unfinished temple gopurams.\n\
  \nFor many years, as my Autowala turned tourist-guide described to me, scores of\
  \ people visited this Ganesha temple before walking into the \u2018world-famous\u2019\
  \ Hampi market, that sold silk and spices attracting traders from as far as Europe.\
  \ Today, the temple housed me alone. The primary Virupaksha temple was quite a distance\
  \ and not many ventured far from there. I walked further into the dark sanctorum,\
  \ as bats squealed above my head, warning me to harbour caution in their \u2018\
  home\u2019. The air inside was cool and smelled of bat-droppings. And then I made\
  \ a discovery in that darkness! My eyes fell upon the lower-back of the idol. A\
  \ few shades of red were still visible on the otherwise colourless idol. Even after\
  \ 500 years, that portion of the statue had retained some colour! This, I thought,\
  \ was due to the sunlight and wind never reaching this part of the temple. Is it\
  \ even documented somewhere? I didn\u2019t care. In a world where every inch of\
  \ land is already scaled, I left the Ganesha-temple with my own happiness of discovery.\n\
  \nFor when I trekked into a valley led by a local pandit, I found a Sadhu sitting\
  \ before a tall anthill. Its height seemed equal to two men put on top of one another.\
  \ I bowed in a Namaste, not in devotion to the abode of the Snake-God, but in awe\
  \ of its grandeur. I had never seen a bigger one. \u201CLegend says\u201D, said\
  \ the Sadhu with an outstretched palm, \u201Cthat this anthill is owned by the snake\
  \ of Shiva. Who visits it in the months of Saawan. And disappears without a trace.\
  \ May he bless you.\u201D I put a five rupees coin in his palm, wondering if the\
  \ Sadhu was blessing me or scaring me.\n\nWhen the evening fell, I returned to my\
  \ host\u2019s farmhouse after a day of several \u2018discoveries\u2019. I mustered\
  \ courage to approach the two dogs chained to the tree. I walked near and Salt leapt\
  \ forward to place her front legs on my chest. She looked into my eyes and wagged\
  \ her tail ever so softly as her lofty tongue hung out from the mouth. She discovered\
  \ that I was not there to annexe her land and I discovered that she didn\u2019t\
  \ hate me for any reason. She took a leap of faith. I too.\n\nToday, revealed to\
  \ me were the ancient colours of an age-old Ganesha temple, a huge anthill guarded\
  \ by a mythical snake and a pair of Golden Retriever whom I was no more afraid of."
