Text: "This is the story of traveling adventures to find something no ones have experienced.\
  \ I rode my bike to Margalla hills pf Islamabad, I heard there\u2019s a way lead\
  \ to murree from Pir sohawa. But when I started My journey on a not trustable bike\
  \ to that way. I wandered into some very beautiful valleys. There were no people\
  \ around. Only the nature mountains, Grean trees, shurbs and birds chirping. The\
  \ sound of water flowing through little streams made that environment so peaceful.\
  \ That I left the whole world behind and felt, I\u2019m flying, waving, and felt\
  \ light. the sun was going down, the weather was getting cold, I wasn\u2019t thinking\
  \ of getting back. Because I was feeling so restful at that moment. I just don\u2019\
  t wanted to lost the moment. But I couldn\u2019t stay in that wild place even though\
  \ it\u2019s so beautiful. So after getting a little dark I decided to get back to\
  \ Islamabad, but later I chose to go through murree. So I took a very narrow path\
  \ through some small villages to Gorha Gali, Murree. That was the epic adventure\
  \ because my bike\u2019s tire burst on my way back so I had to face some problems\
  \ reaching back. But the valley I found lying in between two cities worth the struggle.\
  \ I love wandering to the least known places or not know places. Please hit me up\
  \ if there are any places you want me to visit to. With this epic adventure call.\
  \ I\u2019m signing off now."
