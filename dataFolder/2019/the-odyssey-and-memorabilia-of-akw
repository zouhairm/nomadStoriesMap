Text: "The holiday season in 2016 was the most breathtaking journey I have ever had.\
  \ I did not expect this would happen with the perfect companion, my father. I was\
  \ in an exuberant ambiance because of it. A day before my father told me that I\
  \ had to accompany him. I was just wondering about it. He always talked about his\
  \ intention directly. Then the day was coming, I prepared myself in the morning\
  \ to accompany him. Meanwhile, he checked the motorcycle. He said he would take\
  \ me to a beautiful unknown place as the reward for my achievement as the first\
  \ rank school.\n    My odyssey was begun. We rode a motorcycle to the Alam Kandung\
  \ Waterfall. We have not been there before, so we used Google Maps to guide us.\
  \ Located in Rejotangan, the south side of my city, Tulungagung. We went through\
  \ about 30, 6 Km for almost one hour. When I was on the road I felt so joyful and\
  \ refreshing because of the fresh air from the rice field. I thought that we would\
  \ always through an easy road, but I was wrong. We had to overcome some steeps road.\
  \ Of course, it decreased my happiness and made me complaining. \n    Finally, we\
  \ reached the destination, Alam Kandung Waterfall. The entry fee only Rp. 5K for\
  \ one adult and the parking fee also same. I thought the waterfall just the same\
  \ as other common waterfalls. Otherwise, it was totally different and unique. It\
  \ had many streams and some lake, its color looked like a blue sea. The stone in\
  \ the waterfall had a lining that reminded me with coral reef, it was very bizarre\
  \ and scenic. The air was very fresh because of high trees grew and far from the\
  \ crowded city. I saw butterflies and heard bird twittered. Maybe this is the voice\
  \ of nature. I also surprised by a flying fox in there, I did not suppose it in\
  \ this area. \n    All of the panoramas incredibly amazed my eyes and calmed my\
  \ mind. I almost forgot to explore it with my father. He asked me to climb the peak\
  \ of the waterfall. Actually, I was afraid to climb it because I never climbed a\
  \ waterfall before, but my father told me that the stone was not slippery. So I\
  \ started to climb and it was so fun climbing until the peak of the waterfall for\
  \ the first time with my father. I asked my father to take some photos of me. I\
  \ soaked my feet into the water and I stepped on something weird. I took it from\
  \ my feet, it was a diaper trace. What kind of people who did this unresponsible\
  \ act? I would throw it to the dustbin, but I did not find any dustbin there. Afterward,\
  \ I got down from the peak of the waterfall and continue to explore it. I walked\
  \ into the main waterfall, there is a big lake below it. Some people challenged\
  \ their adrenalin by cliff jumping. People also swam in the lake happily. Unfortunately,\
  \ I could not swim, so I just took some photos.\n    When we tired of exploring,\
  \  we decided to take a break. We bought some snacks nearby and we ate together.\
  \ I looked around the area while eating. It was regrettable that the toilet was\
  \ not in good condition, very dirty and not functional well. I also found a mysterious\
  \ ancient statue outside the waterfall. My curiosity asked me to approach it. Suddenly\
  \ I realized one of the rules given by the tour guide, no one allowed to approach\
  \ the ancient statue area. I did not know why, but I should obey and respect it\
  \ because I believed it was for our safety. After we felt satisfied with Alam Kandung\
  \ Waterfall, we went home. On the way to home, I thought that I got many lessons\
  \ to struggle for my goal, not complaining, not giving up, conserve the nature and\
  \ grateful for everything that life provide for me. Someday I wanted to back there\
  \ to do research about the stone and watercolor of Alam Kandung Waterfall. I also\
  \ intended to identify the ancient statue in there."
