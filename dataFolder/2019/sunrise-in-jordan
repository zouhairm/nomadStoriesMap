Text: "I traveled to Jordan to fulfill a lifelong dream of visiting the ancient city\
  \ of Petra. \nThe first glimpse of the Treasury, which comes after a long walk along\
  \ a twisting path, is nothing short of magical. It is an image that will forever\
  \ be inked onto my mind. One that makes me smile and remember the feel of the sandstone\
  \ walls beneath my hand as I follow their curves in the pre-dawn light. It makes\
  \ me recall the excitement building in our little group as we round one corner after\
  \ another, constantly teased with the promise of finding the hidden city just beyond.\
  \ Until, finally, there she is - peeking out between the rose-coloured walls. Protected\
  \ and safe, she appears to slumber until you discover her behind that last curve\
  \ in the wall. There is something intimate about finding Petra: her sudden reveal\
  \ is pure delight and you are filled with joy and excitement.  \nPetra was everything\
  \ I imagined and more. \nAfter the wonder and majesty of Petra, I didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to fall any further in love with this beautiful, ancient land of Jordan. Then\
  \ we travelled south. To Wadi Rum. \nWe arrived late in the afternoon to the campsite\
  \ where a traditional dish of lamb, cooked for a day buried deep in the sand, was\
  \ presented to welcome us. After filling our bellies and as the light faded to darkness,\
  \ our Bedouin host Ahmad offered to introduce us to the desert. \nAfter pulling\
  \ on warm clothes, we are escorted out into the night with nothing but our guide\u2019\
  s bobbing lantern to follow. Nothing, that is, except the full majesty of the Milky\
  \ Way spreading out above our heads. We traipse through the sand, putting distance\
  \ between us and the lights of the camp, until we round a sand dune and find ourselves\
  \ seemingly alone in the desert. \nWe settle ourselves onto the cold sand and watch\
  \ as Ahmad creates a small fire with the twigs he has been collecting and begins\
  \ to boil water. Along with generous spoonfuls of black tea, he throws a handful\
  \ of sage into the teapot and lets it steep for five minutes before spooning in\
  \ copious amounts of sugar. He passes around the hot sweet beverage and we sit,\
  \ sip and listen to his wonderfully poetic stories under the twinkling canopy of\
  \ the brilliant night sky. \nLater, in our carpeted tents, we tuck ourselves into\
  \ bed, and fall asleep, dreaming of princes and princesses of times long past. \n\
  And there are still more charms of Wadi Rum to be discovered. \nIf you can rouse\
  \ yourself from your warm bed and venture into the cold pre-dawn air, if you can\
  \ sneak through the slumbering camp and not wake a soul, if you can clamber up a\
  \ sand dune ignoring that for every two steps you sink back at least one, you will\
  \ be further rewarded. For it is at the top of the mountain that the wonder of this\
  \ land is fully revealed. \nIt is here I sit, cross legged at the ledge, looking\
  \ out onto the desert. It is quiet and calm: reverential even. From this high vantage,\
  \ Wadi Rum appears to be reaching out in every direction, creating a feeling of\
  \ space, of expanse and strangely, of inclusion. I breathe in the cool air and watch\
  \ the colours play \u2013 they change from pink to orange, brown to red and yellow\
  \ to gold. The palette of this wakening desert is incredible; it makes me wish I\
  \ knew how to paint. I sit, enveloped by the desert and patiently wait for the sun\
  \ to fully appear, tracking a caravan of camels moving sedately across the foreground\
  \ as I do so.\nThere is such peace here. Such harmony. \nAs I sit and await the\
  \ dawn, I consider the emotions the desert has created in me and the tranquility\
  \ it makes me feel.\nPetra will always be my first love, but it is the serenity\
  \ of the Wadi Rum desert that has taken hold in my soul."
