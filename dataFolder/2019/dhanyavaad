Text: "We are a few hours away from our destination when the first mutterings of a\
  \ storm reach us. \n\nThe signs are subtle at first. The darkening sky, the wind\
  \ stirring through our hair, the air pressing ever-so-slightly differently against\
  \ our skin. Our faithful guide Raj sniffs the air and traces the horizon with discerning\
  \ eyes. He tells us it would be best to find shelter until the storm passes. We\
  \ do not have much recourse but to agree. \n\nEven now, it is hard to feel uneasy.\
  \ Surrounded by mountains swathed in mist and majesty, the hike through the foothills\
  \ of the Himalayas leaves me breathless at every turn. With nobody in sight beyond\
  \ Raj and Jitka, this side of India is a world away from my impressions of the dusty\
  \ chaos of Delhi. Our path clings to mountainsides and winds through valleys, and\
  \ with Raj navigating ahead my eyes are free to wander through the sweeping green\
  \ expanses of my surroundings. The swelling curves of the mountains fade into the\
  \ distance, interposed with the jutting edges of rock faces and crags. From afar,\
  \ we are afforded glimpses of Everest itself, broody and imposing. The peace that\
  \ has stolen over the three of us is profound; we are all spellbound by awe of being\
  \ immersed in such wild, raw beauty.  \n\nThe rain begins hesitantly, intermittently,\
  \ testing its capabilities, then grows in confidence. Soon my rainjacket is soaked\
  \ through, and I am making an unpleasant squelching sound with every step as my\
  \ hiking boots take on water. My glasses are more of a hindrance than a help, and\
  \ the others are not faring much better. \n\nBlindly following Raj and endeavouring\
  \ not to sprain an ankle in the process, I scramble over rocks and roots made treacherous\
  \ by the rain. I do not realise we have left the main trail until Raj motions for\
  \ us to stop while he forges ahead. I exchange a wry glance with Jitka as we take\
  \ in each other\u2019s sodden state. My stomach growls in a poor imitation of the\
  \ thunder rolling overhead, the roti eaten in the sunshine of the morning a distant\
  \ memory. \n\nRaj returns before long, beckoning us onward. We are led up a narrow\
  \ path that twists through the undergrowth, and when I chance to glance up, I am\
  \ surprised to see the regular edges and joined corners of a man-made structure\
  \ ahead. The promise of respite from the rain drives us eagerly forward. \n\nIt\
  \ turns out to be a stable of sorts, piled with hay and musty with the smell of\
  \ its animal occupants, and our saviour its owner. He awaits us, solemn-faced, a\
  \ cigarette puffing from his lips as he gestures towards two rickety plastic stools\
  \ amongst the hay. Jitka and I gratefully abandon our dripping backpacks and sink\
  \ down, exhausted. He and Raj remain standing, exchanging pleasantries in Hindi\
  \ and the occasional low laugh. \n\nPresently, Raj nods to us \u2013 wait here \u2013\
  \ and follows our host out into the downpour. We cannot see far past the deluge,\
  \ and the drumming of the rain drowns out nearly every sound. Even the occasional\
  \ bray of the donkey beside us seems strangely muted. When they return, they are\
  \ bearing four steaming cups of chai between them. Despite the temperate September\
  \ climate, I am beginning to shiver, and the cup is a hot blessing to wrap my hands\
  \ around, its fragrance warming my lungs as I breathe it in to thank our host. The\
  \ sweet spice of the first mouthful works its way down my throat and heats me from\
  \ within. \n\nThe two men squat amongst the hay to wait out the storm; soon we join\
  \ them, Jitka producing a pack of cards in the process. She previously taught the\
  \ game of gin rummy to Raj and me, and as we play, our host follows the game with\
  \ interest. Before long, we have a fourth player, and huddled together somewhere\
  \ in the Himalayas, my world is reduced to the play of card after card, the taste\
  \ of chai still lingering in my throat, and the rumbling of the storm outside, all\
  \ lit by the kindness of a stranger."
