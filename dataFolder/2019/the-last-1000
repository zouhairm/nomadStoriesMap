Text: "It\u2019s taken me realizing that the amount of money I have left in my bank\
  \ account equals exactly what I owe on my credit card to ring the alarm. I am broke.\
  \ The travel fund is empty.\n\nThe first realization was that I could not keep traveling\
  \ on my own the way I had been as a couple the last year and a half; the second,\
  \ that I possibly couldn\u2019t keep traveling at all. I had no plan B to begin\
  \ with, no safety net. Have been on the loose in Asia for over a year. \n\nFor the\
  \ last four months, I have been sustaining myself by volunteering at a guesthouse\
  \ in Malaysia for accommodation and eating free food at a Sikh Temple while I come\
  \ up with a new plan. I also had to borrow $1000 while I turn myself back around.\
  \ It is great time to rethink the how.\n\nIt\u2019s unfortunate. But sometimes,\
  \ it takes me hitting rock bottom to realize that I need to take measures to change\
  \ a situation. And this is what is happening now. I am not desperate, don\u2019\
  t get me wrong. In fact, I feel a sense of calm. The thing that I dreaded happening\
  \ when it hadn\u2019t happened has happened. So now, I am rising to its challenge.\
  \ I am seeing a great opportunity for change through this, and it\u2019s exciting\
  \ to have but no choice to do something about it. One thing I am asking myself a\
  \ lot right now is: how much does one really need to be happy? As I am finding out,\
  \ the answer is: not a lot. And so, rather than buying a flight home with the last\
  \ $1000 and come home defeated, I have decided to dare myself to grow. I am broke\
  \ but thirsty for adventure \u2013 and it\u2019s a good combination.\n\nI have fundamentally\
  \ always been a conformist. A cog in the machine. I defined myself by my job, by\
  \ what I did, what I looked like, what I bought. I worked not only to define this\
  \ mind-made self more clearly, but also to maintain some form of security for the\
  \ future \u2013 most of it material \u2013 and to save enough to allow me to travel\
  \ \u2013 also in the future. We\u2019re all guilty on different levels of building\
  \ our lives for the future, along the way forgetting that we live in the now. But\
  \ does seeking security for the future bring us happiness in the present?\n\nEverything\
  \ is impermanent, even security. At one point, we are bound to lose everything:\
  \ our family, our partner, our money, our job, our own life. What will there be\
  \ left when everything else goes? The world is not a safe and comfortable place.\
  \ It is full of challenges and hurts \u2013 and to think that we can ride it unharmed\
  \ is a misconception.\n\nSo I am stepping out of my comfort zone. I have done just\
  \ enough work in the last couple of months to sustain myself for a little while.\
  \ And part of that last $1000 was used to buy a bicycle. I have decided to let go,\
  \ look at all this uncertainty right in the eyes and accept that the only certainty\
  \ is that everything in uncertain. It\u2019s sounds scary and crazy, and in some\
  \ regards it kind of is, but it was one of the simplest decisions I ever made. There\
  \ is no plan B, there never was. I will succeed or I will fail, and whatever the\
  \ outcome, I hope to be able to see that either is great, because I will learn and\
  \ I will grow. I want to live with less, challenge myself, see what I am made of,\
  \ feel the wind of independence on my cheeks and live so fully that it will hurt\
  \ me to leave when it\u2019s all over. I want to show myself that nothing really\
  \ matters as much as I used to believe and that I am an infinitely small part of\
  \ a much greater whole. The universe has got my back. Our hours are counted and\
  \ the best we can do is to stop worrying and ride this great big wave called life."
