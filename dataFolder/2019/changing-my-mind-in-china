Text: "\xBFWhat i need to go to China?\n\nThat was my first question when some close\
  \ friend asked me about to travel to China. \n\nFirst all of you need know, in my\
  \ country (M\xE9xico City) only 2% of people have the opportunity to go to China,\
  \ \nfor that reason when you think in China you only can think an impossible dream.\n\
  \nThat year was 2017, i remember i was walking on the street, and that friend called\
  \ me,  At the beginning i laughed a lot, but of course my first answer was \u2026\
  \ Yes.\n\nHe said \u201Cyou need only your musician talent\u201D, i felt really\
  \ fortunately because I started to learn music when i was 11 years, but in that\
  \ moment i was 27 years old, and finally i was watching the results of many days\
  \ of study.  I remember since that question my life changed. \n\nWe started the\
  \ process.\n\nFirst: i needed send a video to show my music talent\nSecond: we need\
  \ send a blood studios, to they can check that i don\xB4t have any diseases of sexual\
  \ transmissions\nThird: Send a paper whit no criminal record.\nFour: when they received\
  \ all documents, i need wait for invitation from China government to start the process\
  \ with work visa here in M\xE9xico City.\n\nAfter three months i was on the airplane\
  \ to go to China, but i need had three stops before; first stop was Canada, second\
  \ stop was in Shanghai and after 31 hours i arrived to Xiamen City.\n\nXiamen Island\
  \ is on the south of China, belongs to the province of Fujian.\n\nI traveled whit\
  \ many ideas about Chinese people ( dirty people, rude people, we believed that\
  \ they eat rats) but that ideas it was only because in the past here in M\xE9xico,\
  \ people from China started to come here and work, and after few years we had many\
  \ Chinese people; Since that moment the Mexican people started to said: \u201CThe\
  \ Chinese people came here and they take our jobs\u201D, and the government had\
  \ to provide support, in 1907 people and Mexican government started to attack the\
  \ people from China whit racist comments, in 1917 they started to catch Chinese\
  \ and put in jail.\n\nWe were born with that racist idea, but In that moment i though\
  \ It\xB4s my chance to change my imagen about Chinese people, New life, new adventure,\
  \ and i was there. \nXiamen is an Island and you can find there temperatures around\
  \ 38\xBA C and 41\xBA  C, surrounded by sea and mountains you can feel the purity\
  \ of the air; The Chinese currency is Yuan, you can eat in Xiamen for 20 Yuan (\
  \ 2.98 USD ) or drink a beer for 7 Yuan ( 1.04 USD ) and, for the first time i saw\
  \ the power of Typhoon, when the sky start to put dark, the wind is very strong\
  \ and you can smell the sea in the air, you need prepare all your things because\
  \ the typhoon comes, and all the music that you can listen in Xiamen is the music\
  \ of the rain.\nMy work in China was Music Director of Percusi\xF3n, We had a big\
  \ show with different people from different countries , for example: Dancers form\
  \ Russia, Africa and India, clowns from Russia, Acrobats from China, singers from\
  \ Colombia and Philippines.\n\n2017 i lived there for three months and in 2018 for\
  \ six months.\nIn two years i had the power to change my mind about China, find\
  \ me with my self, know more about Chinese love, about essence of people, religion,\
  \ music, traditions and culture; i can say many thing about China, but i think it\xB4\
  s better if you have the opportunity to investigate more about them, in fact is\
  \ not only with China, it\xB4s with all the cultures around the world; Maybe you\
  \ can find more answers about life.\n\nI love China\xB4s culture and i love live\
  \ there, for me that country is the dragon that wake up now, and they can looks\
  \ like whatever that you want, but in their minds only exist the idea to be the\
  \ first potency in the world."
