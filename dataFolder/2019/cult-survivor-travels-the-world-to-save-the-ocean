Text: "Don\u2019t know much about Marine conservation? No worries, neither did I.\
  \ I was a self-proclaimed witch last living in New York with a cryptic past and\
  \ found myself in Thailand with 9 future scientists (honestly not even sure how\
  \ I got accepted) without a clue as to how to \u2018pass\u2019 as some semblance\
  \ of normal. \n\nSo I didn\u2019t.  I wasn\u2019t there to make friends, I wanted\
  \ to make a difference. For too long I\u2019d been haunted by thoughts of polar\
  \ bears standing on melting icebergs and plastics accumulating, surpassing the size\
  \ of landmasses. \n\nBut that wasn\u2019t all I was haunted by. When you leave an\
  \ close knit community, there is no manual on how to integrate with society. It\
  \ was a long, awkward process, a bit like as portrayed in The Unbreakable Kimmy\
  \ Schmidt, but I had no Tidus. \n\nThe days were full of diving, curry and sunsets\
  \ but still the darkness slipped in. It occurred to me, if that depression can sneak\
  \ up on me in paradise, I must really be in trouble. \n\nI was guided by my love\
  \ for the sea and fascinating with sharks, and as a digital nomad, I could continue\
  \ as long as I could keep my head level. Many calls to my childhood caretaker back\
  \ in Oregon helped and I managed to train all the way to Dive Master, despite being\
  \ unfit and lazy my whole life prior. \n\nWhen I was in Thailand, I fell in love\
  \ with an Australian, then several months later, I moved to Melbourne. Everyone\
  \ told me that ship had sailed, but somewhere in my heart, I knew we\u2019d be together.\
  \ \n\nThe moment I arrived it was like we were married. But I noticed feelings of\
  \ distrust and fears of abandonment arise, and instead of communicating it like\
  \ a healthy person, I turned to the only method I knew, self-sabotage. I forced\
  \ the relationship to be \u201Copen\u201D and started dating a woman and a few months\
  \ later, both connections fell apart. \n\nWhen I first arrived, I missed my witch\
  \ collective in New York and started a women\u2019s organization, finding myself\
  \ somewhat of a cult leader. \n\nI went back to Thailand, he followed me there.\
  \  We had a tumultuous affair, but ended with love and my returning to the US. I\
  \ was invited to set up a conservation program with Cristina Zenato, a shark expert\
  \ in Bahamas in exchanged for dive instructor training. From there, I got a job\
  \ as an instructor and conservation consultant in Barbados. I lived by Rhianna\u2019\
  s dad in an area I was told not to leave the house at night. All along, I missed\
  \ Asia. I just love it so much there.\n\nWhen I was in the US briefly, I saw my\
  \ father for the second time since I was 7. It was the first time I really saw him\
  \ as the really broken person he really is. He'd always been the villain in my life\
  \ just to see him as a man with trauma and regrets it was one of the most heartbreaking\
  \ moments of my life.\n\nI picked myself up and kept going. I got a job in Malaysia\
  \ working for an ocean documentary studio doing social media and PR. That job crumbled\
  \ to financial hardship, but I got a diving job the next day in Indonesia. My body\
  \ couldn\u2019t handle the constant diving, I was getting sick constantly and my\
  \ boss wouldn\u2019t grant me time to recover. One day, after dancing all night\
  \ on mushrooms with a hot stranger and only having 3 hours of sleep, I lost it on\
  \ an unruly customer and my whole life fell apart.  \n\nI was haunted by my childhood,\
  \ my head was spinning and all I wanted was to escape. I\u2019d hit my lowest low.\
  \ In the years leading up to this, I\u2019d struggled to stay passionate about conservation,\
  \ for it too was amounting to my depression. Every tourist with a plastic water\
  \ bottle complaining that there was too much trash around was getting to me.  \n\
  \nI had to lose everything to find myself. Just like in an airplane emergency you\
  \ put the oxygen mask on yourself first, you can\u2019t save the world before you\
  \ save yourself."
