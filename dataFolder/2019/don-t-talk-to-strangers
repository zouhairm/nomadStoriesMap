Text: "Like any good American kid, I learned early that one of the golden rules of\
  \ childhood was not to talk to strangers. Honestly, though, what else are you supposed\
  \ to do when you\u2019re trapped next to a chatty one for two hours at night? \n\
  \nI was living and working in Dalian, China, and flying back from a weekend trip\
  \ to Xi\u2019An. My seatmate was quite excited to be mere inches away from a captive\
  \ native English speaker. \n\n\u201CI studied English in school!\u201D she exclaimed.\
  \ \u201CI\u2019m opening an English school for children! My husband is helping me.\
  \ Would you like to see my wedding photos?\u201D\n\nHer enthusiasm was explained\
  \ as she described how their ceremonies had taken place mere months before. Ah,\
  \ newlyweds. We scrolled and scrolled through engagement photos on the beaches of\
  \ Dalian and in meticulously manicured gardens. There were pictures of her in a\
  \ white western-style wedding gown, as well as the more traditional bright red qipao\
  \ embroidered in elaborate gold designs.\n\nShe explained the images of silly games\
  \ her husband and his groomsmen had to play the morning of the event in order to\
  \ reach her and earn the honor of marrying her, like walking barefoot over lego-like\
  \ objects. Men in suits beaming. Girls in soft pink dresses giggling. Portly family\
  \ members toasting. \n\nThe joy and togetherness she showed me felt so similar to\
  \ weddings I\u2019d attended in the states. She had officially piqued my interest\
  \ and warmed my heart. I fought my natural tendency toward introversion and my midwestern\
  \ upbringing telling me to mind my own business and began to ask her questions.\n\
  \ \n\u201CHow did you choose your colors?\u201D \n\nThere\u2019s a reason why the\
  \ national colors of China are red and yellow, and she wasn\u2019t just feeling\
  \ particularly patriotic on her wedding day. Red symbolizes luck, joy, and good\
  \ fortune while yellow was commonly associated with royalty and is considered powerful\
  \ and fortunate as well. \n\nAnd the soft pink bridesmaids\u2019 dresses? \u201C\
  I just like pink,\u201D she laughed, \u201CI think it\u2019s pretty!\u201D\n\n\u201C\
  What does your husband do?\u201D\n\nSimple enough, answer: he\u2019s a police officer\
  \ in Dalian. Not so simple? \u201CIt made our honeymoon difficult to plan, because,\
  \ you know, he cannot leave China.\u201D No, actually, I did not know that at all.\
  \ I received an unexpected lesson about the expectations of law enforcement under\
  \ China\u2019s government. \n\n\u201CHow did you meet?\u201D\n\nShe spoke of their\
  \ parents being work acquaintances and thinking they would be a good match. \u201C\
  Your parents really do know best in the end,\u201D she nodded sagely. She spoke\
  \ candidly about the pressures to marry well and not embarrass the sacrifice the\
  \ generation before them had invested in their success. \u201CWe are the only child,\
  \ so much of their hopes rest in us,\u201D she told me. Which, due to over three\
  \ decades of a one-child policy, is true for so many young adults in China. \n\n\
  As our plane descended into Dalian, I expressed my nervousness about cabs being\
  \ available to take me home, due to the late hour. She brightened. \u201COh! My\
  \ husband is coming to pick me up, we can give you a ride no problem!\u201D My mind\
  \ quickly flashed to my dad\u2019s only kind-of joking words full of caution and\
  \ love: \u201CDon\u2019t get kidnapped, kid. Don\u2019t make me have to come over\
  \ there and kick some ass.\u201D \n\nI crossed my fingers and went with my gut.\
  \ \n\nNot surprisingly, her husband was just as lovely as she was, albeit a little\
  \ more nervous due to his less-than-fluent English. Before we parted ways, I had\
  \ been invited to their home for dinner. I could feel my dad\u2019s nervousness\
  \ oceans away. \n\nLater the next week I traveled to a part of the city I would\
  \ have never known about and ate dumplings, played board games, and cuddled a new\
  \ puppy. All while continuing our conversation about the similarities and differences\
  \ of being young adults in two worlds on opposite sides of the planet.\n\nSorry,\
  \ dad. I talked to a stranger. Got in her car. Went to her house. Ate her food.\
  \ I definitely did not mind my own business.  I may have technically risked kidnapping.\
  \ \n\nHow else are strangers supposed to become friends?"
