Text: "Stomach swelling anxiety or a batch of dodgy pastel de nata, I couldn\u2019\
  t tell. What I could tell was that expanse of nothing was a few metres from my bare\
  \ feet, on frigid and soggy sand. Don\u2019t get me wrong, the ocean was stunning\
  \ \u2013 both to look at and ponder- with its captivating, often surreal creatures\
  \ and cryptic depths, but it irked me. I\u2019d never been comfortable with the\
  \ sea at more than knee depth. This moment of my trip to Portugal had been burning\
  \ the neurones in my mind for weeks. I would not only be more than knee deep, but\
  \ fully submerged; I was petrified.\n\nThe whole trip was novel; I\u2019d never\
  \ been abroad, or anywhere for that matter, without older adults. For the first\
  \ time I was afloat on my own, suspended without a life line, and it was terrifying.\
  \ I was with friends who\u2019d push me into this experience. They revelled in water\
  \ and enjoyed surfing, it\u2019d be stupid to assume they wouldn\u2019t drag me\
  \ in.\n\nRenting surfboards and wet suits was the beginning. Baleal Beach was a\
  \ stretch between the mainland and a small peninsula. One day it would be swallowed\
  \ by the sea and that day would be awe inspiring yet intimidating. The wet suits\
  \ were skin tight, much like skinny jeans I\u2019d wear at home, with none of the\
  \ comfort and with all the suffocation of a python. The same anxiety python that\
  \ had been eating me up about this moment all week. \nSurfboard under my arm and\
  \ with trusted, if not rambunctiously misguided, friends by my side, we waded into\
  \ the water. With each step I took, climbed a chilling dread that washed through\
  \ my wetsuit, much to my dissatisfaction \u2013 I was under a strange delusion that\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t feel the water. I could swim well, but this didn\u2019t dissuade\
  \ my paranoia of being suspended in nothingness, miles away from any discernible\
  \ solid ground. \n\nI was barely chest deep into the water, before I was on my toes\
  \ avoiding the inevitability of being submerged. I was a mortified child and Mum\
  \ was nowhere to be seen; holding a random adult\u2019s hand would have been met\
  \ not with understanding but Portuguese ramblings about the creepy, pale, man-child\
  \ that hugging their legs. My friends, witnessing apprehension, looked at me. Steely\
  \ determination in both their eyes. My pasty complexion likely mimicking deep-sea\
  \ ghost sharks that inhabited my mind, circling that small child whom refused his\
  \ current situation. \n\nMy feet left the ground. My chest turned to granite and\
  \ I clung to the surfboard, like a little boy to a teddy bear in the darkness. I\
  \ summoned strength to climb atop the board and paddle with my friends towards the\
  \ surmounting waves, despite every ounce of sensibility screaming that this was\
  \ a stupid idea. My friends, seasoned surfers- at least in comparison to me \u2013\
  \ readied themselves for the oncoming wave, turning and paddling away, ready to\
  \ ride it back to shore. I, being my stubbornly simple self, sat tight with my feet\
  \ dangling off the surfboard, suspended. In the seconds before the wave obviously\
  \ knocked me off the board, my feet had become entangled in a wad of seaweed. Of\
  \ course, the sea sensed my fear and like any borderline sadistic creature would,\
  \ it took advantage of me. Asshole.\n\nI struggled, lungs burning from inhaled sea\
  \ water and face frozen from Portugal\u2019s ironically wintery waters. The seaweed\
  \ at this point, decided I\u2019d suffered enough and relaxed its hold on my ankle.\
  \ I floated to the surface and inhaled sharply. Blue skies above filled my view.\
  \ For the first time, I was afloat on my own, suspended without a life line, and\
  \ it was liberating. Relinquishing control and letting the water guide me back to\
  \ the shore, surfboard in tow. My chest burned, my body ached, and I was icy cold;\
  \ however, I was alive, my spirit insatiable, I wanted to go again. Fear diminished\
  \ and anxiety quelled, I continued to make leaps, and dives, into the unknown."
