Text: "In the Amber Spyglass by Philip Pullman, a former nun compares falling in love\
  \ to travelling to China. Once, she had accepted that the 'treasures and mystery'\
  \ of a such a country were not for her, and in her state of aloneness believed herself\
  \ to be happy. But confronted with the absence of god, she realised that there was\
  \ no one to bless or condemn her; that she had turned her back on love for no reason;\
  \ that \u2018Heaven was empty\u2019. But China is not.\n\tI came to China as a single\
  \ woman via an eight-hour sleeper bus from Hanoi, three days on the back of a friend\u2019\
  s motorbike, a dirt track leading to a nondescript ridge, and a barbed wire fence\
  \ with a hole in it. On the other side of that barbed wire was a country I never\
  \ thought I\u2019d visit. What else might appear on the horizon of my life, if I\
  \ could stand in the sunlight of the impossible on an ordinary evening in April?\n\
  \tHa Giang is Vietnam\u2019s northernmost province, and 90% of its population are\
  \ members of ethnic minorities including H'M\xF4ng, T\xE0y, Dao, and L\xF4 L\xF4\
  . We passed washing lines strung with items of various traditional dress: embroidered\
  \ tunics, tasselled coats, aprons bright as rainbows. Children in beaded headdresses\
  \ worked in the fields with baby siblings strapped to their backs. Old women padded\
  \ by us on the road, their bodies bent permanently double from lifetimes of carrying\
  \ bundles of long grasses on their backs. A girl waded through the diamond-bright\
  \ sparkles of a river, and I twisted around on the bike to watch her until she disappeared,\
  \ swallowed by a wall of rock.\n\tWhen we stopped for gas at a tiny pump in a harsh\
  \ stone valley, a woman with a baby in a sling smiled at me. I pointed to the elaborately\
  \ decorated sling\u2014pink velvet embroidered with neon green embroidery\u2014\
  and said, \u2018This is beautiful.\u2019 The woman looked down and backed away.\
  \ Later, I would learn that such items are intended to disguise babies as flowers.\
  \ By drawing attention to the sling, I had potentially attracted evil spirits to\
  \ the baby. The chasm between me and the people of that province was so vast that\
  \ there was no end to the depths of what I didn't know.\n\tWith every hour and mountain\
  \ we left behind, the distance grew between us and any concept of home or reality.\
  \ We ascended and descended through mountain passes between impossibly steep slopes\
  \ cut with rice terraces. Wind shook the branches of firs bordering the road and\
  \ tore holes in the valley mist, bringing us glimpses of a mint-green twist of river\
  \ far below. Every hairpin bend brought a moment in which the bike would either\
  \ cling to the s of the mountain or soar off it. \n\tExamining an online map of\
  \ the region on his phone, Bren pointed out a trail between Vietnam and China that\
  \ was marked \u2018illegal border crossing\u2019. As the sun was lowering in the\
  \ sky, we bumped up a track to a stretch of rusted barbed wire. A tablet engraved\
  \ with a skull and crossbones warned that landmines left over from the Sino-Vietnamese\
  \ war in 1979 could still explode along the border. I got off the bike and walked\
  \ forward alone, into China.\n\tFor a long time, I sat on the ledge of road with\
  \ my legs dangling over what I would later learn was Yunnan Province. In the evening\
  \ light, the valley's patchwork of fields glowed and softly swelled around a wooded\
  \ hill where a mild wind stirred leaves with an ancient sound. Even at this distance,\
  \ I could hear it. In the most precious book of my teenage years, being in love\
  \ was compared to going to China. I had been in love before. But if I had held to\
  \ that love, I never would have walked into China as a single woman and felt moved\
  \ beyond recognition by the potential my life still held. Somehow, all roads had\
  \ led to this illegal trail, and the only right I had to the world I looked on now\
  \ was to walk over the cliff edge, into the abyss. Still, I continue to fall."
