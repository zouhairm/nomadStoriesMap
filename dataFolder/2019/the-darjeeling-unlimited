Text: "I travelled to Darjeeling to escape. It was a hot summer days in Rangpur, Northern\
  \ Bangladesh, with the humidity level touched the sky. Most of the Bangladeshi were\
  \ fasting and waiting impatiently for the biggest muslim celebrations after completing\
  \ their Ramadhan. I was flooded with sweat everyday and every night since air conditioner\
  \ was still considered rare and special, especially in a rural area. That\u2019\
  s how I started my plan to travel somewhere cooler and not too far from Bangladesh.\
  \ \n\nThen, I found Darjeeling from Wes Anderson. His movie, \u201CThe Darjeeling\
  \ Limited\u201D, dragged my curiosity to explore the real Darjeeling. After all,\
  \ the name itself, Darjeeling, sounded so musical for me, and I also like the famous\
  \ tea from there. Spending a week in the foothill of Himalaya would be great! Soon\
  \ I got a week of Eid Al Fitr holiday, I started my fascinating routes. I took a\
  \ shared jeep which was much cheaper than a private taxi even though I had to cram\
  \ with other 15 passengers, with four people each rows. The guy next to me had to\
  \ spread his arm so we could seat more comfortably. I didn\u2019t mind because I\
  \ knew that he was trying to save more space. At least, I was lucky enough to get\
  \ a window seat. The trip was totally paid off with the cooler and nicer weather\
  \ welcoming me on that evening of my arrival. It was not even more than 24\xB0C\
  \ in summer! It was heaven for me. The town itself was so alive with its hilly roads\
  \ full of busy jeeps honking to each other and lots of beautiful hiking trails were\
  \ just around the corner. For me, it was a perfect combination of what I was looking\
  \ for a summer escape. \n\nThe next day, I took Darjeeling Himalayan Railway with\
  \ its famous Toy Train, a return trip from Darjeeling to Ghoom which covered almost\
  \ 5 miles with a train track was so closed with the stores and houses. It travelled\
  \ so slow that I could imagine that it would be easy if you forgot something and\
  \ someone helped you to hand over it through the train\u2019s window. The rest of\
  \ my stay was full with hiking and made friends with locals. Everyday I went for\
  \ a long walk and hike in the woods full of green tall trees. Sometimes I went on\
  \ my own, some other times with my new friends. They spoke Nepali to each other\
  \ and spoke English to me. I didn\u2019t know why, but maybe it was the matched\
  \ combination between the chill whether and the warmth of the friendship they offered\
  \ me that made Nepali sounded so soothing for me. There was something poetic in\
  \ their tone that comforted my mind. The local food was amazing. I loved cha, the\
  \ milk tea and momo, the steam wontons with various filling of chicken, beef, or\
  \ vegetables. My favorite thing was sitting on a balcony of my hostel, staring the\
  \ Kanchenjunga snow mountain in front of me while sipping a hot and thick local\
  \ Darjeeling tea. It was healing. I finally found my quest for cooler weather during\
  \ almost unbearable hot summer in South Asia region. \n\nAs a bonus, this trip surprised\
  \ me with one sided love affair between me and one Darjeeling gentleman. I fell\
  \ for him too deep and left his hometown with full of heartbeats of romance. Two\
  \ months later, I never imagined that a heart could be so fragile that it was scattered\
  \ into zillion pieces simply because of a single reply of a long distance text.\
  \ However, it didn\u2019t lessen my love to Darjeeling. It has undeniably stolen\
  \ my heart and I will definitely return to conquer the Himalaya."
