Text: "\"Everything ok?\" She asked from her car window, pulling out of the driveway\
  \ slowly enough not to cover me in a cloud of dust.\n\nA reasonable enough question.\
  \ It's highly unlikely she'd seen a lone female cyclist on this stretch of quiet\
  \ and desolate farm road before, let alone one gingerly propping her bike against\
  \ a flimsy branch lying dead across the ground.\n\n\"Yes thanks. Just taking a photo\"\
  \ I responded, equally as surprised to see not just a random homestead, but also\
  \ a car emerging from it. I indicated my photo\u2019s subject by a glance towards\
  \ my bike and beyond to a black Angus cow lazing against the property\u2019s barbed\
  \ wire fence.\n\n\"Her name's Maui\" the driver said, rolling on past. Yes, of course\
  \ it is. And why wouldn't it be?\n\nI couldn't think of a scene further removed\
  \ from the sapphire blue waters of ocean turtles and ripper surf breaks. For late\
  \ summer, it was a surprisingly bleak, crisp morning here in Australia's Southern\
  \ Tablelands, amidst straw-yellow pastures merging into ominous grey skies.\n\n\
  Turns out Maui was also intrigued, slowly lumbering to her feet and sauntering my\
  \ way.\n\nI like cows. They\u2019re quite picturesque. From a distance.\n\nUp close\
  \ and personal they\u2019re harmless enough, I know. But still there's something\
  \ I find just a little unnerving about a 400kg beast heading my way, even if just\
  \ to say good morning. I quickly took the photo \u2013 Maui now having compromised\
  \ my carefully composed frame -, politely thanked her all the same, re-saddled and\
  \ pedalled off again on my merry way.\n\nJust me, my bike, the rolling pastures\
  \ and gravel road unravelling ahead. The occasional dead Eucalypt, now nothing but\
  \ a grey trunk with witchy, twisty, gnarled branches reaching into the sky. Too\
  \ many cattle grids to count, each one demarcating a new paddock, though likely\
  \ still a single property. At one junction I was unsure if the road continued or\
  \ became private driveway, such was its width and level of maintenance. The maps\
  \ suggested a public thoroughfare, so I continued. It was too enjoyable not to.\n\
  \nThis is my happy place. The solitude; the ease of each pedal stroke \u2013 assisted\
  \ by prior training and acquired fitness, the lack of breeze and the relatively\
  \ flat terrain; the world seemingly unto myself; the quiet. The beauty of the drab,\
  \ understated nothingness. This is my reward for all those other days in the saddle,\
  \ both near and far, battling headwinds, stinging needles of rain, the numb and\
  \ painful depths of sub-zero winter mornings, the sweat and flies of summer\u2019\
  s heat, the traffic passing way too fast and too close for my liking, the power\
  \ wattage efforts where my lungs near explode. Not today.\n\nI say I can\u2019t\
  \ meditate. And in a sense, it\u2019s true: I can\u2019t sit still. But here, on\
  \ my bike, I have no thoughts. I simply am. \n\nGiven that today\u2019s ride commenced\
  \ only an hour\u2019s drive from my front door, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking\
  \ I ride here often, noting the changing seasons, the different times of day and\
  \ light, sometimes with friends, sometimes alone, but always exploring.\n\nNope.\
  \ This was a debut and an almost accidental surprise; a work assignment to identify\
  \ and document bicycle tourism opportunities within the shire. The intent being\
  \ to then market these experiences to others.\n\nI think I\u2019m onto something.\
  \ And I think my client should be quite pleased with the opportunities awaiting\
  \ discovery by emerging \u2018groaders\u2019 \u2013 the cyclists buying gravel bikes\
  \ as a hybrid between road and mountain biking, keen to explore country roads off\
  \ the beaten path but within comfort.\n\nFor me, this place is the overlooked and\
  \ underestimated no-man\u2019s-land, the middle ground. Too far to roll out of bed,\
  \ don lycra, clip in and pedal straight from the front door. Yet not far enough\
  \ for a sense of real travel and adventure. \n\nWhile I still desire to pack my\
  \ bike and head to Spain, Portugal and Morocco for exploration of road, coffee and\
  \ cuisine, I\u2019m also quite contented to realise there\u2019s still a world of\
  \ possibilities right here in my own backyard. And that hours\u2019 drive to get\
  \ here? \u2013 That\u2019s time to down at least two coffees en route!"
