Text: "Life is a long journey where we experience countless events, but sometimes\
  \ one occasion is enough to make us grow up overnight. And that occasion often comes\
  \ from the time when we are on the road. After many years, the blur of people who\
  \ have crossed your paths will settle in the corner of your memory. Yet you will\
  \ always remember that brief conversation you had with a local stranger when you\
  \ were travelling in an exotic Caribbean island some years ago. The words from this\
  \ stranger are still giving you the wisdom of life. \n\nOn my second day in Cienfuegos,\
  \ I was lining up in Etesca for buying an internet card. Standing behind me was\
  \ a local Cuban girl. She greeted me and we started a conversation. She was there\
  \ to use the computer service and send emails to her foreign friends. She could\
  \ only do so once per week as that was the only day of the week that she had time\
  \ to stand in a long line to wait for the computers at the internet cafe, the only\
  \ place for most of the Cubanos to connect to the internet. \n\nThe line was still\
  \ long ahead of us. However, realizing that I hadn\u2019t visited the Malecon, she\
  \ said: \u201CLet\u2019s get out of here and I\u2019ll bring you to the Malecon\
  \ before the sun goes down.\u201D \n\nWe sat on a bench along the Malecon, watching\
  \ the sun setting over the Caribbean Sea. \n\nShe asked me: \u201CSo what made you\
  \ come a long way to Cuba alone?\u201D \n\n\u201CI\u2019ve had a traumatic break-up.\
  \ I just wanted to get away.\u201D I answered, surprised by my honesty with this\
  \ stranger whose name I hadn\u2019t even asked for. Although the trauma was still\
  \ there, it had been a while since the last time I talked about it with someone.\
  \ \n\n\u201CYea, I noticed you looked sad when I first saw you. That\u2019s why\
  \ I decided to leave my emails for next week and bring you here. You looked like\
  \ you really needed someone to talk to.\u201D She said. \n\n\u201CDo I?\u201D I\
  \ gave an embarrassed smile. I went on and told her my story. It had been a few\
  \ months already, but it only got worse every day. Now that I had travelled thousands\
  \ of miles to seek salvation from the crystal blue Caribbean Sea, yet the pain was\
  \ still following me around. \n\n\u201CThings happen for a reason. It may seem something\
  \ bad at this moment, but who knows, it might be a start of something good. In our\
  \ life, love comes and go. Especially in the Caribbean, maybe it\u2019s because\
  \ of the climate, passion is often fast and brief.\u201D She said. \n\n\u201CIsn\u2019\
  t it sad?\u201D I asked. \n\n\u201CWell, we have a life to survive. We have come\
  \ a long way since the 60\u2019s, when we couldn\u2019t produce anything because\
  \ we had no petrol, and children died of diseases because we didn\u2019t have any\
  \ medical technology. Now we have survived isolation and become self-sufficient,\
  \ but life is still a battle that we have to get by. There\u2019s nothing else that\
  \ can distract us.\u201D She answered. \n\nFair enough. The core of life is survival.\
  \ Without a living, there\u2019s nothing that love can depend on. \n\nWhen survival\
  \ is no longer a pressing issue, we forget about the essence of life and let ourselves\
  \ be defined by additional matters. \n\n\u201CNevertheless, to oppression, plundering\
  \ and abandonment, we respond with life.\u201D Said by Gabriel Garcia Marquez in\
  \ \u201CThe solitude of Latin America\u201D. \n\nMaybe this is how life is supposed\
  \ to be. In front of traumas and damages, the basics of life are where we resort\
  \ to for the primitive happiness. \n\nWe continued chatting while looking at the\
  \ sun sinking into the sea. The sky had now turned to a deep orange flame. More\
  \ Cubanos were coming and sitting along the Malecon, talking and laughing, ending\
  \ their day there. There was a fresh breath of simplicity pervading the Caribbean\
  \ evening air. In my heart, something started to be let go. Burden started to be\
  \ released. I guessed I finally had my moment of epiphany in this Caribbean town\
  \ full of the vigor for life."
