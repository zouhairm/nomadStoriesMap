Text: "\u201CShould we go?\u201D We were three 21-year-old American women discussing\
  \ an invitation to midnight riverside drum and dance lessons from young Senegalese\
  \ men.  Our most adventurous friend, Zoe, announced that she would be going with\
  \ or without Sara and me; so we relented \u2013 after all, going together seemed\
  \ the safest option.  We were studying abroad for a semester and enjoying a one\
  \ week sojourn to Toubakouta; visiting NGOs and rural businesses.\n\nThe rest of\
  \ our peers had retired to their straw-thatched, air conditioned huts, but Zoe,\
  \ Sara, and I were itching for adventure. Besides, how could we resist a request\
  \ from the beautiful, well-muscled drummers we had witnessed slapping taught animal-skin\
  \ djembes; their sweat-beaded chests glimmering in the torchlight?\n\nA Senegalese\
  \ painter had divulged to me that the secret to West-African skin tone was purple\
  \ and gold. I had watched the boy with purple-gold skin, long twisted dreads, and\
  \ a bright-endless smile, pound on his drum. When we met beside the driftwood fire,\
  \ I shook his swollen, calloused hand. \u201CNanga def?\u201D A Wolof greeting translated\
  \ as \u201Care you here?\u201D The reply is \u201CManga-fi rek\u201D \u2014 \u201C\
  I am here only.\u201D My efforts were often met with a surprised and joyful laugh,\
  \ \u201Cthe Toubab has learned Wolof.\u201D \n\nOur lessons began with a repeat-after-me\
  \ drum session from the five men who had constructed the bonfire. The three of us\
  \ paired off with three of them; the two additional men wandered home with long\
  \ faces. My new happy friend stuck by my side. He was my age. I was attracted to\
  \ his gentle, curious demeanor.\n\nNext came the dance lessons. The men were very\
  \ impressed with our skills; we hadn\u2019t mentioned that we had been studying\
  \ drumming and dance back at the school in Dakar. Malik instructed me to put my\
  \ hand against my ribcage, to feel my heartbeat and allow it to match the drumming,\
  \ then to let my feet join in. Next comes the hips. I felt the heat of the fire\
  \ and the breeze from the water, saw Malik\u2019s shining golden-brown eyes and\
  \ heard the giggles of my companions. When our moves were eventually deemed adequate\
  \ by our free-spirited teachers\u2014we dashed crazily for the water, ripping off\
  \ our long skirts, and retaining our undergarments in an act of mock modesty.\n\n\
  The men trailed behind excitedly \u2013 Malik dove beside me in the salty water.\
  \ I submerged myself completely, becoming one with the water, and rose to face his\
  \ toned, warm body. We gazed at the millions of stars visible in the inky black\
  \ sky. I asked if he gave out many late-night lessons to tourists, but he promised\
  \ we were the first women to oblige. Something in his huge kind eyes and shy manner\
  \ made me believe him. In this Muslim country, men and women do not casually intermingle\
  \ and intimacy is reserved for marriages with someone of the same cast and ethnicity.\
  \ \n\nMalik and I held each other with goose-bump covered arms. I felt safe with\
  \ him beneath the infinite universe that was made ever more infinite reflected on\
  \ the dark waves around our hips. I felt the blood pulsing in his lips as we kissed,\
  \ his yearning soul touching mine. \n\nOur kissing session was disrupted by Sara\
  \ who called to us from an abandoned rowboat floating nearby. We climbed aboard\
  \ the soaked wooden panels and stood on the bow, dancing closely now, with abandon-filled\
  \ love in the land of Teranga. We talked about the importance of pursuing art, even\
  \ when it is difficult and undercompensated.\n\nThese men who work 14-hour days\
  \ in rural West Africa, with souls as expansive as stars, and hearts that beat to\
  \ the calls of the birds and the trees, cannot be found anywhere else. They could\
  \ not make enough money in a year to buy a plane ticket, and if they did leave,\
  \ Western culture would wring out the light in their eyes with its hunger and fear.\n\
  \nWe held hands on our way back to shore and dried ourselves by the fire. We promised\
  \ to see each other again one day, inshallah \u2013 \u201Cif god wills it.\u201D\
