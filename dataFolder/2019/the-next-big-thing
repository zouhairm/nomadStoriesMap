Text: 'Traveling is not my profession, it''s my passion.It''s my hobby & my daily
  routine.Last days, I have been selected for a conference in Karachi which is the
  historical city of the World.I started my travel of 2200 km on Buses, Trucks, Train,
  Rickshaw, Pickups, Taxi, & Car. I reach the conference point by enjoying the journey
  of 60 hours. During this time I meet the diverse people of country & I have explored
  the 7 ethnic group, 15 cultural groups, 30 foods, 9 languages people and much more.
  I have got a chance to make a connection of 120 people network for whole life which
  belonging to diverse areas & backgrounds.I too enjoyed the deserts, seas, mountains,
  & glaciers during this traveling.

  This traveling has changed my life & will be changing the whole world in the coming
  times.I have met a person which will work with me as a project manager.I reach to
  found business idea & that person will help me reach out at my vision. Without my
  traveling, it''s was impossible to meet the new people.I will give the advice to
  people that If anyone wants to learn something new, he should travel in the world,
  he should explore the nature.

  One gold medalist winner columnist of Pakistan, Javed Chaudhry says, I have not
  learnt from my book as I learn from the traveling of world.Beauty of world gives
  spirits to you to explore the things.This is all for human.'
