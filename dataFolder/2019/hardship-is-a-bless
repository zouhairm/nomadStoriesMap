Text: "Here I am, after more than 14 hours on the boat, finally, we could see Barcelona\
  \ on an early morning of 8th September 2017.\n\nI made a lot of friends on that\
  \ boat; French Algerians mostly, one shared with me a dinner, another old man shared\
  \ with me tips, he assumed that I won\u2019t come back to Algeria, I still remember\
  \ how he used to tell me; women will save you, even God won\u2019t, no one will\
  \ but women.\n\nI helped some French Algerian get three packs of cigarettes (legal\
  \ number) out of the seaport. He gave me one for free that I sold for 38 \u20AC\
  \ later in Carrer de l\u2019Hospital, in Barcelona.\n\nI was walking for the first\
  \ time in Europe, it was 8 AM or so, just trying to process the idea; that all this\
  \ what I\u2019m seeing now is less than 800 km from my hometown back in Algeria.\
  \ Yet, very different, emphasis on \u201Cvery different\u201D.\n\nNow, I had to\
  \ look for cheap accommodation, noting that I had only 100 \u20AC on my pocket,\
  \ yes, one bill, and two packs of Isabelle tuna, 3 cans each, 6 total, and some\
  \ traditional bread.\n\nSo my plan was spending the first night in the cheapest\
  \ hostel to shower, clean myself up, and get prepared to the misery that was coming.\n\
  \nI was still walking, excited, yet, stressed on the situation, I was thinking,\
  \ what the heck I put myself in, what a challenge! I am not made for this, I\u2019\
  m a rational guy, always taking rational decisions, who never takes risks, I put\
  \ order first. Yet, I had to live that experience, I had to be rebellious, to feel\
  \ the misery, because pain is a form of pleasure.\n\nOn a narrow street, I heard\
  \ someone speaking in Arabic, I was surprised, I instantly jumped on him, asking\
  \ him if he knows any cheap hostel; he literally said: \u201CI think God sent you\
  \ to me, I am staying in a hotel for 15 \u20AC a room per night, I had a dispute\
  \ with my Spanish wife because she wants kids, and I don\u2019t.\u201D, I thought\
  \ he was joking when he said 15 \u20AC, and I had to ask again if it was a hotel\
  \ or hostel.\n\nWe walked down to Pla\xE7a Reial, in some narrow street, there was\
  \ indeed a hotel on the second floor, owned by a Spanish lady who doesn\u2019t speak\
  \ English at all, so I had to use my broken Spanish.\n\nHe told me that you will\
  \ find a Moroccan guy who\u2019s some sort of a manager there, his name is M, tell\
  \ him that an Algerian traveler sent you from Mostaganem ( a city in Algeria). M\
  \ then approved my stay and sent me to the Spanish lady.\n\nCu\xE1ntas noches, she\
  \ said, I replied: \u201CUna\u201D\n\nVery clean, comfy, and surprisingly, in the\
  \ heart of Barcelona. \n\nPla\xE7a Reial, later on, became my QG, I loved that place,\
  \ the fountain in the middle, the tourists, the fancy restaurants, Moroccan guys\
  \ performing street art, an Asian guy playing freestyle football, someone singing\
  \ in Spanish; what a beautiful voice he has, the birds, the sounds, the music, the\
  \ air, the clouds, it\u2019s just amazing. Life was indeed felt there.\n\nI walked\
  \ so many kilometers in Barcelona that day, I memorized most of it, it\u2019s so\
  \ easy in Europe, everything is square, everything is labeled. From El Poblenou\
  \ to Park Guell.\n\nI see tourists; families, couples, a lot of them seem trapped\
  \ in their comfort zone, it\u2019s hard to explain the feeling I had, coming from\
  \ a place like my hometown, everything is improvised, risk takers, life survivalists.\
  \ it\u2019s like I always wanted to sense the genuine, free, out-of-comfort-zone\
  \ life, that hardship, that joy from painful obstacles in life, and yet there are\
  \ people in the other side of the Mediterranean living a different life, not better,\
  \ but different.\n\nBecause at the end of the day, I didn\u2019t choose my way of\
  \ life, I gained it. I didn\u2019t choose where to be born, the more I experience\
  \ or discover, the more I\u2019m grateful. If tomorrow an apocalypse happens, we\u2019\
  re the readiest on the planet. Hardship is a bless."
