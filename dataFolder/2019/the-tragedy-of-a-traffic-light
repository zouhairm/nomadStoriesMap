Text: "while passing by the Sacre Coeur in a short visit to Paris a French tour guide\
  \ stopped me suddenly and asked: \u201CThere are two kinds of travelers in this\
  \ world; those that travel to live and others that live on traveling and sharing\
  \ what they witness..what person are you?\u201D. I could not find an answer that\
  \ day and it took me a while until I found it. I admit I fall into the latter tribe.\
  \ \nOver the last five years, I have traveled to many countries in Europe and Asia\
  \ and also visited the US, and as a writer and journalist I kept asking myself,\
  \ should I write about my experiences traveling.\nI believe that travel literature\
  \ has regressed in recent decades due to the evolution of technology. Nowadays,\
  \ anyone can just Google a country, then watch, listen and read everything about\
  \ it instead of buying a book; this was the most challenging issue.\nThus, I always\
  \ determine how the conflict of culture-shock is really the key to writing about.\
  \ I am coming from a middle-eastern country with a different background. Those culture\
  \ gaps are not seen by any mean except a human eye and mind. emphasis the ironic\
  \ tone in the comparisons of Egypt to other countries, especially when discussing\
  \ how an Egyptian, got by in Europe.\nI want to shed light on the differences and\
  \ the huge cultural gap between us and them in every aspect of life; from food,\
  \ bathrooms, transportation, zoos, airports, revolutions, to the leadership and\
  \ our histories.\nMaybe sharing this  funny and embarrassing story would give a\
  \ hence:\nIn 2014, I visited a small French town to mingle with the European countryside.\
  \ The remote town was an austere beauty. Simplicity was the theme. Small colorful\
  \ houses, every group of them shows a circle of symmetric elegance. It was like\
  \ a middle-ages castle, The streets were heavenly quiet, a kind of an ancient interlock\
  \ texture passways, shops were amazing tiny underground halls like eastern markets.\
  \ Moreover, local pedestrians were ecstatic overwhelming to welcome me, however,\
  \ they usually do not witness foreigners.\n I decided to wander around the town,\
  \ on a kind of self-guided tour. I was impressed by the rule-keeping, as well as\
  \ the infrastructure of the countryside; even the farmers were highly educated,\
  \ acknowledged by speaking multi-languages. But what was noted mostly the way they\
  \ showed great respect for the traffic lights.\nI wanted to give the locals a good\
  \ impression of Egyptians so, however in my country roughly anyone can find a traffic\
  \ light in the street, and if you did find one, mostly no one would give it any\
  \ attention. \neven though there were no cars, I decided to wait for the red traffic\
  \ light to turn green in order to cross the street. Ten minutes passed\u2026 then\
  \ 20. Not a single car had come down the road and the traffic light was still red!\
  \ I thought that the lights were broken so I attempted to fix them when a small\
  \ boy appeared out of nowhere and pushed a button. The traffic lights immediately\
  \ changed to green. As the boy was crossing the road, he turned and gave me a strange\
  \ look that I understood well: the look you only give to a complete idiot, who does\
  \ not know how to use a traffic light."
