Text: "I am guy age 18  who is just trying to figure out all about inner world and\
  \ so outer. It was my first time when I was traveling alone  till now I have my\
  \  parents \"my back pusher's \"I had faith that if something goes wrong they will\
  \ save me. Now this time yeah it's me who gonna play the hero role. I stepped into\
  \ a city named BHUBANESHWAR and it's in eastern part of India. Before I countinue\
  \ my story let me tell you this  that.i a from northern part of India. So just imagine\
  \ yourself  in a place where no one knows you. You don't know the language .Basically\
  \ people over here speak oriya because it's come in state of orissa and I am telling\
  \ you even Einstein can't Disipher this language lol. But I  understood. Ya I did\
  \ the language of emotions. People are very nice over  here. And  as we all live\
  \ in 21 century I checked every thing about the place.and you know what there is\
  \ a place where I always wanted to go.. And yeah here I got it. That's \" Beaches\
  \ \" I just love it. Cold brezzes   sitting by cold sand having some waffers and\
  \  drinks and just thinking about nostalgic moments and you smile. No you actually\
  \ laugh... And then again see \" Never ending sea\"... Their are many things I want\
  \ to tell but I would love to  share everything in person... Till then I will keep\
  \ those stories to my self. And ya  I know I am not a very good writer but ya I\
  \ know things I live on emotions feel. And I think if you write something. Reader\
  \ should feel the exact same feeling .it cab be sadnes.\n It can be excitement it\
  \ can be astonishment  and yeah every feeling matter's to me  atleast Because i\
  \ think feeling is what makes us human.  So  yeah we should express it..  That's\
  \ all from my side. Will be waiting to meet up. Till then tc."
