Text: "Just last year, I bought a one way ticket to Bali, Indonesia. The paradise\
  \ island. I had no plan on what I'm going to do, besides working. So I was working\
  \ for IT Company, they hired me as a consultant and a translator. The best thing\
  \ about my job is, I could work anywhere remotely, (sending my work through email).\
  \ I have never been to Bali before, and also I didn't know how long I will stay\
  \ there, but I spent 5 great months living in Bali with no regret at all. My project\
  \ in Bali was already finished within 2 months I was living there, but then I decided\
  \ to extend my stay for the next 3 months. Just because I fell in love with the\
  \ island, the people, the food, the culture, the parties, the beaches, the vibe,\
  \ etc. \nThe first day I arrived, I took a solo trip to Ubud, as I was so curious\
  \ about that place. I went to see the rice terrace, and some waterfalls. I went\
  \ back home to Canggu to try all the food as I was really hungry from the trip,\
  \ I ate 5 times on that exact day. It was freaking delicious! Some of the dishes\
  \ I tried are Nasi Campur, Ayam Betutu, some smoothie bowls and vegan burgers.\n\
  After I spent almost a week spoiling myself with the trip and the food, and I realize\
  \ I need to go back to work. So, I applied for a membership at this co-working space\
  \ in Bali, where I met some people with bizarre jobs ever. I met a guy who was on\
  \ that day is sitting next to me, asking me about what kinda job I've been doing\
  \ and we had a little chats during our working hours on our each laptops. He told\
  \ me he's having an online business working as a masseuse, he's performing a Yoni\
  \ Massage for woman. And he's trying to expand his business all over Southeast Asia,\
  \ because he said Bali is one of the biggest market. And I met a girl from Germany\
  \ who is working as a sleep coach. Well, apparently some people do hiring professional\
  \ like her to teach them how to sleep better. And she took me out to volunteer at\
  \ the beach to collect all the plastics that has been washed out to the shore, which\
  \ is surprised me in a lot of ways about how could be this beautiful island are\
  \ so contaminated with plastic and garbage. \nOn the weekend, I was trying to figure\
  \ out what to do, so I installed my Tinder app. I had a match with this cute Dutch\
  \ guy, and he picked me up on his scooter at my guest house, and we went on for\
  \ a drink and some tacos. After that we decided we don't wanna go home, because\
  \ we were so connected and we kinda want to spend more time to see the nightlife\
  \ in Bali. We went to a beach club and we were too drunk to go back home, we were\
  \ making out and went skinny dipping at the beach, and it was already 2 AM. And\
  \ yeah, we were hooking up by the side of the beach, we woke up the next morning\
  \ only to realize our clothes were washed off by the waves, and we went home on\
  \ a scooter on the bright day light completely naked. \nDespite the crazy weekend\
  \ I had, I was planning to make a trip to Medewi for surfing. I took a trip it's\
  \ likely almost 3 hours from Canggu to Medewi, it was worth all the effort, and\
  \ Medewi is one of the most beautiful places in Bali. I'm surprised that not so\
  \ many tourists are aware about this place, there were some tourists but mostly\
  \ locals. The waves was crazy, I called it The Devil's Waves, perfect for surfers.\
  \ \nI love Bali so much, and I understand why so many people from all over the world\
  \ decided to settle there. I made the most of my time in Bali, trying to keep it\
  \ balance between work and pleasure. But still, the pleasure was what I have the\
  \ most."
