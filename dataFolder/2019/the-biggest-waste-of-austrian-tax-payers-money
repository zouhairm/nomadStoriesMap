Text: "Chocolate-box medieval buildings and stately baroque ones sit side by side\
  \ in enchanting harmony. The city is surrounded on all sides by breathtaking mountains\
  \ which lend a clear and crisp air, even in the summer when it is weighed down by\
  \ tourists. In short, Salzburg is a sort of Eden. However, my overwhelming memory\
  \ is not of classical elegance or the tacky Mozart souvenirs. People make travel\
  \ and there\u2019s a museum warden who\u2019s indelibly seared her vivid self into\
  \ my mind.\n\n\nThe Mirabell Palace was a lovers gift, from the prince-archbishop\
  \ Wolf Dietrich to Salzburg belle Salome Alt. The couple were wildly in love, given\
  \ the 15 children they had and the extravagance of their pleasure palace. \n\nAt\
  \ the time I was visiting Salzburg I had period cramps and I was still recovering\
  \ from glandular fever (mono for any Americans or the kissing disease as my mother\
  \ fondly calls it) but it\u2019s not often someone finds themselves in a city of\
  \ such aching beauty and, without knowing when I would be back I had to take advantage\
  \ of it. I unwisely decided to wait until after seeing a few sites to go to the\
  \ pharmarcy to pick up some painkillers.\n\nAudioguide in hand, I wandered open-mouthed\
  \ in wonder. Lavishness and craftsmanship never cease to amaze me. The decadence\
  \ of the marble hall, the philosophy of more being more, gold, mirrors, tapestries,\
  \ all in excess- they can make our modern world seem stale and dull. After room\
  \ upon room, I began to tire. Each ornate and elaborate chamber started to melt\
  \ into one and I felt dizzy. I sat down. \n\u201CWas machst du gerade?\u201D\n\u2018\
  Ehhh.. Iche no spreche deutsch\u201D\n\u201CWas machst du gerade?\u201D\n\u201C\
  Eh I\u2019m sick\u201D\n\u201CSick! I will get doctor\u201D \n\u201CNo, no, really\
  \ there\u2019s no need. Danke.\u201D\n\u201CFive minute!\u201D The short, plump,\
  \ middle-aged security lady held her hand, five fingers outstretched. She did so\
  \ with great gusto. \n\u201CEh\u2026 Ok.\u201D\nIt was going to be awkward to explain\
  \ to a medical professional that I had cramps and desperately needed a nap.\n\n\
  After five minutes she returned with an electrician and a pair of scissors. \n\u201C\
  Sick?\u201D the electrician asked. I nodded. \n\u201COk\u201D, he did a thumbs up\
  \ and left. Security lady used the scissors to cut the rope across a museum settee.\
  \ She said something in German while pointing at me and then the chair. \n\u201C\
  I don\u2019t need to lie down danke.\u201D\nFirmly, she held my elbow and guided\
  \ me from the chair museum wardens sit on to the sofa that made up part of the museum.\
  \ I lay down. Two Asian tourists took a picture of me and I recall an American saying\
  \ something to the effect of \u201CGeee! What\u2019s going on here?\u201D In another\
  \ bizarre turn of events, the electrician returned, with a Toblerone and blanket.\
  \ I wanted to leave at this stage but neither seemed to have any English. The electrician\
  \ went at great lengths to tuck me in and while doing so the museum warden returned\
  \ with a Bluetooth headset. \u201CDoctor in 10 minute!\u201D, she did the same hand\
  \ gesture as earlier but this time with two hands. The electrician nodded gravely.\
  \ He left and returned with some newspaper to put under me in order to protect the\
  \ museum furniture and then re-tucked me in. I offered him some Toblerone. He declined.\
  \ \n\nIt was at this point my brother, my travel buddy, arrived. He was not sympathetic.\
  \ He laughed and took pictures. The security lady asked him to leave but after some\
  \ pointing, gesturing and saying \u201CBruder\u201D repeatedly he was considered\
  \ inner-circle along with herself and the electrician. Suddenly, she touched her\
  \ Bluetooth piece and started shouting excitedly: \u201CDer Krankenwagen ist da!\
  \ Der Krankenwagen ist da!\u201D.  This apparently means the ambulance is here.\
  \ \nYes. \nAn ambulance was called because I had period cramps. \n\nI had a sliver\
  \ of Salome Alt\u2019s life, chocolate, people waiting on my every need and getting\
  \ to lounge on palatial furniture. Maybe the modern world isn\u2019t so sterile\
  \ after all."
