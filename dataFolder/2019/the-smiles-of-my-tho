Text: "Getting to the village was an adventure in itself. After a taxi to the bus\
  \ station, a grueling wait for the bus, an hour\u2019s ride in the reclined seats\
  \ of one of Southeast Asia\u2019s ubiquitous sleeper buses, and a motorcycle ride\
  \ with some dubious old Vietnamese men, we finally arrived. A teenage girl in glasses\
  \ and pink pajamas approached us with a warm smile. \n\n\u201CHello. I\u2019m Hang.\u201D\
  \n\nI had agreed to the trip on a whim. When I had suggested an overnight trip to\
  \ the Mekong Delta to a new acquaintance at my hostel in Saigon, I had imagined\
  \ one of the bus-and-boat trips that are easily accessible and foreigner friendly.\
  \ But Lital had found a homestay opportunity in M\u1EF9 Tho, where a local girl\
  \ would guide us and let us stay with her family in exchange for some English practice.\
  \ \n\nHang\u2019s house was humble, with only a few rooms, rudimentary plumbing,\
  \ and some noisy fans to keep the constant heat of southern Vietnam at bay. Adorning\
  \ the main room was an old-fasioned sewing machine, Hang\u2019s English books, and\
  \ an altar with family photos and incense as well as an icon of Jesus and a small,\
  \ fake Christmas tree. \n\nUpon meeting her mother, it was easy to see where Hang\u2019\
  s smile came from. Since she spoke no English, she communicated with us solely through\
  \ smiles and laughter. The first thing she did, after setting down a plate of succulent\
  \ watermelon and a basket of small, sweet bananas, was to share some of her prized\
  \ possessions: baby photos of her children and her own wedding album. I gently turned\
  \ the pages, containing photos of her in white standing with her tall, serious husband,\
  \ her beaming smile drawing my eye in each one. \n\nWe accompanied them to church\
  \ that night, a first for me. While I didn\u2019t understand a word of what was\
  \ happening, I was struck by the sense of ritual, and the large presence of song\
  \ and chanting throughout the service. Not so different from the Jewish services\
  \ of my youth. \n\nLater, after devouring a home-cooked dinner and slurping down\
  \ fruit smoothies at a shop that repaired automobiles during the day, we were taken\
  \ to Hang\u2019s uncle\u2019s house, to meet members of her extended family. I was\
  \ led to the back of the house, to a simple, stone-floored kitchen. There I found\
  \ a stout, old Vietnamese woman frying bananas over a wood-burning stove. The cousin\
  \ explained to me that even for this village, this was unique, as most people had\
  \ switched to gas stoves. \n\nI had never seen anyone cook this way, and asked the\
  \ grandmother about her banana recipe, with the cousin translating. Grandmother\
  \ stared into my eyes, a cheerful grin on her face, and asked me a question. The\
  \ cousin burst out laughing.\n\n\u201CWhat did she say?\u201D I asked.\n\n\u201C\
  She asks if you\u2019ve ever fallen in love with a Vietnamese boy!\u201D\n\nSitting\
  \ cross-legged on the floor of the main room, squished between various cousins,\
  \ we tried Granny\u2019s fried bananas. They were soft and pillowy, a perfect harmony\
  \ of sweet and savory, the best kind of grandmother food. \n\nAnother cousin arrived,\
  \ a gawking, bespectacled youth. His presence caused a flurry of conversation and\
  \ laughter from the family members. I caught the words \u201CAmerica\u201D and \u201C\
  California\u201D. \n\n\u201CSay hello, speak English!\u201D barked Hang\u2019s uncle.\
  \ \n\n\u201CHello,\u201D the poor kid muttered as he blushed a vibrant shade of\
  \ red. \n\nIt seemed Granny had found me a Vietnamese boy after all. \n\nThat night\
  \ felt like the sleepovers of my youth, with us girls side by side on thin mattresses\
  \ on the floor in Hang\u2019s house. We chatted into the night, bonding over Youtube\
  \ videos. Hang is a truly remarkable person. At only 18 years old, she is boldly\
  \ chasing her dreams of using English to travel and connect with people from around\
  \ the world. But although she has these big dreams, she is still a simple village\
  \ girl who loves her family and her God. \n\nNot so different from me."
