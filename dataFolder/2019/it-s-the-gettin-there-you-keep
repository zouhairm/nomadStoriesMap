Text: "It\u2019s the Getting\u2019 There You Keep \nBy Andrew Stites, Tulsa, OK\n\n\
  My father taught my brother and I to ride motorcycles as kids. I remember crawling\
  \ onto the R80RT BMW that rarely left the garage (and I eventually rode from Tulsa\
  \ to the Daytona 200 through both an ice storm and the \u201CDragon\u201D at Deals\
  \ Gap}. My brother and I learned throttle control and clutch operation on a 250cc\
  \ two-stroke Yamaha Trials bike. \n\nDespite countless  stories of riding adventures,\
  \ the 15,000 mile round trip from Oklahoma to Denali (via Moto-GP in Laguna Seca)\
  \ proves the most epic. Over 5 weeks, my brother, father and I averaged nearly 500\
  \ miles a day on two R1150GS\u2019 BMW motorcycles and one R1150GSA. The extra gas\
  \ in the GSA paid off in Oregon when the non-Adventures ran out of gas \u2013 twice!\
  \ \n\nWe saw the North Rim of the Grand Canyon, the \u201CNarrows\u201D of Zion\
  \ National Park, John Ford\u2019s Monument Valley, Hwy 101 from Monterey north to\
  \ the turn off to Eugene, OR. We camped at Bodega Bay (where Hitchcock filmed \u201C\
  The Birds\u201D}. We paid $12/liter for gas on the Alcan Highway in the Yukon, changed\
  \ tires in Anchorage, ate fresh halibut on the \u201CSpit\u201D in Homer, AK, spent\
  \ a cloudless day spotting bears, wolves, and the truly awesome peaks of the mountain\
  \ in Denali National Park. And that just covers the way there!\n\nWe rode the Dawson\
  \ Highway on our return {being sure to hang a sign in Dawson Creek}. Throw in some\
  \ Canadian hot springs, the plains of Saskatchewan, Banff, Glacier, all the Harley\
  \ Davidsons being trailered to Sturgis, and the adventure came to its bittersweet\
  \ end.\n\nIf anything is taken from this journal, please let it be this: Live Now!\
  \ If an opportunity presents, don\u2019t think twice. Life will always intervene,\
  \ and as I write this, I haven\u2019t seen nor spoken with my father or brother\
  \ in years. I am grateful and blessed to have these memories of better times.\n\n\
  Ride safe!"
