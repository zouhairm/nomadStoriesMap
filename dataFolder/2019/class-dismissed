Text: "There is something unmistakably eery about an empty place that should be rightfully\
  \ populated by children; a playground at night, a forgotten amusement park, or in\
  \ this case: an abandoned school. Like walking through a fading memory my footsteps\
  \ echo awkwardly, almost unwelcomely though the lifeless hallways.\n\nThe tide marks\
  \ that hug the walls of the second floor pronounce themselves to me as I make my\
  \ way higher up inside the building. Although it is largely a grey day outside;\
  \ the sun still tries its best to shine through what gaps it can find in the clouds.\
  \ It is as if there is a landscape-wide set of blinds, opening and closing, illuminating\
  \ in pockets what remains of the innards of the school. Or rather, the sun acts\
  \ as an unwelcome and indecisive spotlight, appearing only occasionally to highlight\
  \ what is missing: seats with no children, a blackboard with no teacher and hallways\
  \ with no laughter. Some blackboards even have chalk markings remaining from that\
  \ fateful day. Children\u2019s drawings remain on the walls and a display cabinet\
  \ houses the damaged clock from the destroyed school gymnasium. The clock permanently\
  \ stuck on the time when the waters breached the school, exhibits a moment of disaster\
  \ frozen in time. \n\nThough, it could have been much worse\u2026\n\n\u201CThank\
  \ you, Arahama Elementary School\u201D greets a sign hung above the school\u2019\
  s battered entrance. The school itself, which has the dimensions of an enlarged\
  \ 2x4 Lego brick and the colouring of a white t-shirt worn too many times, saved\
  \ the lives of 320 people when the Great East Japan Earthquake and its following\
  \ tsunami ravaged this small coastal town back in March 2011. Though 700m from the\
  \ coast, the strength of the waves were such that they managed to reach the school\
  \ and blast their way through the lower levels. Students, teachers and other local\
  \ residents managed to escape to the roof of the building moments before the hallways\
  \ and classrooms were to be flooded with rubble, cars and other debris. Looking\
  \ at photos from that day it is as if the school was in the centre of a colossal\
  \ flowing river; biblical in scale. Those who sought refuge on the school rooftop\
  \ made the wisest decision of their lives, as the school was one of only a handful\
  \ of buildings in the town to survive the tsunami. \n\nI step onto the rooftop and\
  \ see the bleakness which covers the earth surrounding the school. If you were to\
  \ look at a satellite image of the area today you would see a real-life blueprint\
  \ mapped out on the terrain; empty plots and shapes of homes where there are none.\
  \  The sun is still sifting its beams through whatever gap it can find amongst the\
  \ clouds. It is one of those days where with a flick of a switch the weather could\
  \ either turn into a torrential downpour or subside into a sun-soaked vista. The\
  \ sky appears melancholic, indecisive, unsure how to move on, much like how anyone\
  \ would feel after a tragedy, how an entire town has struggled to move on after\
  \ a tragedy. The residents of this town have had to look elsewhere to get by, leaving\
  \ their homes and memories behind so that they can survive. \n\nNo wind is blowing,\
  \ but the air carries a chill. This abandoned school reminds me of how I felt when\
  \ my family began to clear out my grandmothers home after she passed; empty walls\
  \ and the shadows of furniture. You don\u2019t miss those items or spaces per se,\
  \ but how the people you loved used to interact with them. You feel the potential\
  \ these places once had and what possibilities are now lost. \n\nTragedies happen\
  \ to us all, but what counts is how we remember these moments and cope in our own\
  \ individual ways. This school shows that even when things appear their bleakest,\
  \ there is always something to cling to. Though class is long since dismissed, this\
  \ school remains strong in the mind like a bittersweet memory. Frozen in time like\
  \ a clock in a display cabinet."
