Text: "\u201CEuropitzi lakweyah?\u201D I asked in badly mangled Kurdish, this time\
  \ to an older gentleman with smiling eyes who was in the process of offering me\
  \ a sample of lokum.  The shopkeeper\u2019s wooden tongs held the gelatinous candy\
  \ aloft as he tried to decipher my question.  Without cell coverage or access to\
  \ Google translate, I had been hoping the phrase roughly translated to \u201CEuropeans\
  \ where?\u201D but had had no luck finding a helpful answer.\n\nLost and separated\
  \ from my group following a number of small but meaningful miscommunications, I\
  \ had been searching frantically through the acres of haphazard rows in Erbil\u2019\
  s Qaysari Bazaar for nearly an hour. Although the ceilings were high, the limited\
  \ natural light made the pathways seem narrower than they were.  I had moved quickly\
  \ through the crowds of people, attracting curious looks as I passed.  \n\nThe appearance\
  \ and clothing of the members of my group were noticeably foreign. While traveling,\
  \ I prefer to try to blend into the local crowds.  But as western travelers in the\
  \ Kurdistan region of Iraq, our obvious differences gave me a glimmer of hope that\
  \ I could quickly return to my friends.\n\nUnlike some bazaars in large cities in\
  \ the Middle East, the Erbil bazaar did not sell glittering, plastic tourist products\
  \ or t-shirts emblazoned with the name of the region on the front.  Dating back\
  \ to the Ottoman period, this was where locals came to shop.  At every fork, I had\
  \ calculated the likelihood of my friends choosing to peruse cloth over home goods,\
  \ nuts and dried fruits over decorative wares.  An aisle smelling strongly of ammonia-based\
  \ cleaning products was a no go.  The row filled with stalls displaying delicate\
  \ glass tea sets provided cautious optimism.  However, my queries had been met with\
  \ quizzical, yet compassionate looks and accompanying shoulder shrugs.  \n\nWhen\
  \ the lokum-salesman motioned for me to wait, I dared to hope he had my answers.\
  \   The man called over Ahmad, a young, hip Kurd with shoulder-length hair and a\
  \ blue tooth permanently attached to his ear, who spoke a reasonable amount of English.\
  \ Neither had seen my group for a while.\n\nAhmad worked at the kiosk next door\
  \ selling honey and rose water with his older uncle, and both were solicitous when\
  \ they learned of my distress.  Ahmad, offered his phone, water, and a seat next\
  \ to the air conditioning, a welcome break from the oppressive heat.  His uncle\
  \ peppered me with curious questions that Ahmad would translate.  \n\n\u201CWhere\
  \ are you from?  What do you do?\u201D  The questions were not canned attempts at\
  \ small-talk, but sincere interest in me and my life.\n\nOne of his uncle\u2019\
  s statements produced an amused burst of laughter from Ahmad.\n\n\u201CWhat did\
  \ he say?\u201D\n\nAhmad blushed and replied, \u201CI can\u2019t tell you.\u201D\
  \ \n\nA bit of teasing and wheedling finally produced my answer.  \u201CHe said\
  \ that if you cannot find your friends, such a pretty girl could just find a husband\
  \ here.\u201D  He smiled, but then paused and gave me a serious look.  \u201CIt\
  \ is only a joke, we will find your friends.  Don\u2019t worry, you are safe.\u201D\
  \  \n\nSafe.  Even in the panic of being lost, I never felt unsafe.  In the middle\
  \ of this large maze of shops and people, having no knowledge of the local language\
  \ and standing out as a foreigner, I worried that I was holding up my group and\
  \ causing my host needless stress.   But in a region of recent conflict and strife,\
  \ in a location less than 100 kilometers from the war-torn city of Mosul, safety\
  \ was far from my mind.  \n\nAhmad and his uncle provided unnecessary kindness without\
  \ thought, a welcoming compassion for a stranger in distress.  After spending an\
  \ enjoyable half hour together trading information about our lives, smiling and\
  \ laughing, I spotted my slightly panicked local host scouring the market as I had\
  \ earlier done.  As I was saying goodbye, a bottle of rose water and jar of honey\
  \ in hand, Ahmad\u2019s uncle said something to Ahmad, putting his right hand over\
  \ his heart.  \n\n\u201CYou are always welcome here.\u201D  \n\nFor the first time\
  \ in our discussion, the translation was unnecessary."
