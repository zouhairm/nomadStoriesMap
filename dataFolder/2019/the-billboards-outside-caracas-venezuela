Text: "Going from the Caracas airport to the city center one can see billboards citing\
  \ former Venezuela president Hugo Chavez ''Together we can anything'' and ''The\
  \ future belongs to us'', accompanying Chavez and nowadays president Nicolas Maduro\
  \ portaits. The future belongs to them, jokes my driver Jose while we moving closer\
  \ to the center. ''Why you have chosen him as a president'', I asked. ''Who chose\
  \ him?'', Jose said, ''Just imagine your wife asking you prefer beef or chicken\
  \ for dinner. You says - beef, but the same day there is only chicken on the the\
  \ table. How it can be? But you wife stays calm and says: dude, you just had a wrong\
  \ desire''.\nThe main obstacle for foreigner in nowadays Venezuela is lack of access\
  \ to local currency. After denomination launched in August 2018, there is almost\
  \ no exhange black market in the country, but people don't have enough cash. In\
  \ order to pay for anything even chewing gum or toilet paper somebody needs to use\
  \ local debit card issued by Venezuelan bank and show local ID-card. There is normally\
  \ no other way to make payment. \nI got help from Kamal, an owner of the taxi company\
  \ who managed transfers for me, 35-year old architect and urban designer. His father\
  \ is from India ad mother happened to be from Venezuela, so he spent all his life\
  \ in Caracas. He has the main constructing business, some contracts with the city\
  \ and its own taxi company. There is not so much competetion in nowadays Caracas,\
  \ as he says.\nIf you don't have a local bank account you can make so called transferencia\
  \ \u2014 to transfer money to local account and use its debit card for a fee \u2014\
  \ normally around 30 per cent. I ve used a local debit card several times as well\
  \ as copy of local id-card, according to that my name was Kamal. If somebody didn't\
  \ believe me, I would show a short written-in-Spanish story that I am engaged to\
  \ Kamal's sister and came to Venezuela to visit my fiancee family. But everybody\
  \ bought me being Venezuelan and never asked any questions. \nCaracas itself appeared\
  \ to be really green city with a lot of green parks but the main problem as lack\
  \ of safety. Once in the past Hugo Chaves supplied slums inhabitants by arms, despite\
  \ limited arms turnover in the country. That's why mos robberies in Caracas are\
  \ armed. Police never intervenes neither in robberies nor in muggings but creates\
  \ the huge traffic jams on the streets hampering luxury cars for bribes. These cars\
  \ are often driven by Spanish and Italian descendants with blonde hair. That's why\
  \ locals joke police is being hunting for blonds. \nYou don't have to pay for gasoline\
  \ on Venezuela, it is almost free, to fill a SUV's tank takes less than 1 US cent\
  \ or even an apple. But you also can't purchase any repairs for your car, oil or\
  \ tyres, as all the prices in this field are regulated by government. That's why\
  \ most people in Caracas can't afford to own cars and the roads are pretty empty\
  \ for 2-mln city. If there is a traffic jam ahead it means only that somewhere police\
  \ stopping cars for bribery.\nThere is popular joke in Caracas, that venezolanos\
  \ invented carnecirias in carne and panaderia sin pan, meaning butcher shops without\
  \ meat and bakeries without bread. Everybody is trying to find some part-time job\
  \ in order to support his family. My driver Jose has been working full time job\
  \ as economist, but in the everning turns to be a taxi driver. There some old decent\
  \ looking people demanding the food on the street, that's why Jose always has candies\
  \ or fruit for them. The rich becoming richer and poor becoming poorer. On once\
  \ far-famed Margarita island one can see bunch of people waiting around dumpsters\
  \ and in the same time three business jets parked at the local airport. \nAfter\
  \ coming back to Caracas I ve me some Russian couple in the hotel and asked them\
  \ about the purpose of their visit to Caracas. ''What you mean the purpose'', they\
  \ were a bit surprised, ''it seems to be the most dangerous city in the world''."
