Text: "When anyone hears \u201C Touring in London\u201D, all they think about is Big\
  \ Ben, The Eye, Westminister Abbey and all the other featured tourist attractions.\
  \ But this story is more about the some of the obscure and quaint little spots in\
  \ the City of London.\nThis is about a Walking Tour, starting outside St. Paul\u2019\
  s Cathedral, which can be seen from the riverside. The big dome can be seen from\
  \ far-away and is one of the signatures of the London Skyline. In 1666, when The\
  \ Great Fire broke out, the Cathedral was nearly destroyed. Sir Christopher Wren\
  \ rebuilt it, along with the rest of the City of London.\nAcross the street from\
  \ the Cathedral, there is a mall, where the terrace is open to the public.  In case,\
  \ anyone can\u2019t go all the way up the dome of St. Paul\u2019s, for whatever\
  \ reason, this terrace is the next best place to get an equally good panoramic view.\
  \ \nNext up, the church of St. Mary Le-Bow, a simple church with a really high Bell\
  \ Tower, with a golden dragon on top.\nNearby is the Swiss Bank and The Guildhall\
  \ Art Gallery. The gallery and the bank are part of the same compound, outlined\
  \ by a black border, for a supposed colosseum, remnant of an amphitheater, from\
  \ the Roman Empire in Britain, which was excavated.\nNext is the Mansion House,\
  \ the official residence of the Lord Mayor of London. It is recognizable by the\
  \ huge chandelier and fancy drapes and bit of walls, leading to guess either a Study\
  \ or a Dining Hall. Every year, a new Lord Mayor is elected and occupies this residence.\n\
  The London Stock Exchange, also known as the Royal Exchange, founded by Thomas Gresham,\
  \ is right across. Initially named after him, his family handled the stock exchange\
  \ for a few generations. Now it is with the Bank of England. The Bank houses gold\
  \ bullions, even today. The Bank Presidents thought that no one will be able to\
  \ break into the Bank. But a sewer worker proved them wrong by finding a way through\
  \ the sewers. The sewer worker left a note to the Bank Presidents on the front door,\
  \ telling them to meet him in the bullion room at night. The Presidents decided\
  \ to indulge him. So they were in the bullion room in the night and he entered through\
  \ the way he found. The Presidents were shocked, but they were moved by his honesty\
  \ and rewarded him.\nIn front of the Bank is a war memorial dedicated to the fallen\
  \ soldiers of World War I.  Behind, there is a clock tower with a golden grasshopper\
  \ on the top. Below it is a statue of Thomas Gresham.\nThrough the old alleys, there\
  \ are many old fashioned taverns and restaurants, one of which was The Simpsons,\
  \ an old restaurant dating back to the Middle Ages, which is open only for lunch.\
  \ The interesting thing about this restaurant is that there is a ghost waiter, who\
  \ takes orders and never brings the food.\nAnother tavern, The Jamaica Wine House,\
  \ is famous for wines and coffees, built during a time when people hated coffee\
  \ and thought it was too expensive.\nNext is Leadenhall Market, featured in Harry\
  \ Potter and the Philosopher\u2019s Stone, where Harry and Hagrid walk in while\
  \ going to The Leaky Cauldron and Diagon Alley. The market, street and door that\
  \ was the entrance to the Leaky Cauldron in the movie can be seen.\nNext up, the\
  \ Business District, which had a lot of modern building, up to the bakery that started\
  \ The Great Fire in 1666. A plaque was there which told the story, that baker had\
  \ left his oven on, which started the fire. The baker and his family escaped the\
  \ fire and even the number of casualties of the entire fire was not so much. Near\
  \ this bakery is the Memorial for the lives lost in that fire. On top, is a golden\
  \ statue of the fire. \nThese were a few facts of some of the hidden places in London,\
  \ where a modern city is seen mixed with history clearly. This shows that there\
  \ is a lot more to explore than just the obvious places."
