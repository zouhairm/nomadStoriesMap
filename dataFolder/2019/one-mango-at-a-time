Text: "I absolutely love mangos. To me, the color, flavor, texture, and juiciness\
  \ of a perfectly ripe mango are almost preternatural.\n\nIn 2010, a former boss\
  \ of mine \u2013 and perhaps the most impactful teacher and naturalist I\u2019ve\
  \ ever known \u2013 told me: \u201CThe only real way to eat a mango\u2026 Is sitting\
  \ naked in a stream.\u201D\n\nYears later, I would later learn first-hand that this\
  \ maxim is not only true but self-evident. \n\nIn 2014, I had the immense honor\
  \ of traveling to Brazil for four weeks \u2013 still my longest travel stint to\
  \ date \u2013 through my local Rotary Club. As part of a now-defunct exchange program\
  \ for young professionals, I was selected among my peers to participate in an all-expenses-paid\
  \ journey to the southern state of Paran\xE1, which is bordered on the north by\
  \ S\xE3o Paulo, on the east by the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by Argentina, and\
  \ on the west by Paraguay. \n\nOf course, mangos are traditionally a tropical fruit,\
  \ so my first reaction after learning I was accepted into this program was to instantly\
  \ daydream of my beloved. After all, I\u2019d never before traveled anywhere tropical,\
  \ no less south of the equator.  \n\nA few weeks later, I embarked on an immersive\
  \ journey into the heart of South America with three of my peers and a Rotarian\
  \ chaperone. Over the course of our stay, we visited schools, factories, non-profits,\
  \ and local Rotary clubs across Paran\xE1. In a word, it was sublime.\n\nOf course,\
  \ I could elaborate at length on the astounding hospitality of each and every Brazileiro\
  \ we met along the way; I could fawn over the sumptuous meals our ever-gracious\
  \ hosts prepared with love; I could even wax poetic on the natural beauty of this\
  \ sub-tropical climate and its colorful flora and charismatic fauna. While I reveled\
  \ in each and every one of these experiences \u2013 through which I learned to open\
  \ my heart, expand my mind, and leave my comfort zone behind \u2013 none were as\
  \ impactful as my time spent with an elderly woman that could have doubled as my\
  \ Brazilian grandmother.\n\nRosa, the live-in mother-in-law of one of our Rotarian\
  \ host families, was 93 when I met her. Immediately upon our arrival, and before\
  \ we exchanged more than a simple greeting, she scurried off to her kitchen and\
  \ returned a few minutes later bearing freshly made smoothies.\n\nWhether she was\
  \ tipped off by my avowed love of mangos or possessed a keen, borderline mystical\
  \ intuition, I\u2019ll never know. I smiled from ear to ear as I accepted her gift,\
  \ savoring the fresh, sweet taste of what \u2013 to me, at least \u2013 was edible\
  \ bliss. \n\nOver the next five days of our stay, in the small town of Curitiba,\
  \ Rosa made sure that every breakfast was served with various drinks made from different\
  \ cultivars of local mangos. Each of her creations was a true revelation. Never\
  \ before had I experienced such an outpouring of love \u2013 a union of natural\
  \ sweetness and human affection \u2013 that both my stomach and my heart were satiated\
  \ in toto.\n\nCulinary and spiritual fulfillment aside, it was on the morning of\
  \ our last day that I would come to learn a lesson that I\u2019ve cherished ever\
  \ since. Just as I and my fellow travelers were climbing into the van that would\
  \ take us to our next destination, I heard a loud but tender pronouncement from\
  \ Rosa, which our guide immediately translated from Portuguese as:\n\n\u201CRemember,\
  \ Aaron, you can only eat one mango at a time!\u201D \n\nIn life, as in travel,\
  \ we can only take things as they come. Too much of any good thing \u2013 even the\
  \ best fruit in the world \u2013 can lose its value if we value quality over quantity.\
  \ Instead, we must try and savor every sweet moment as best we can, trusting that\
  \ the world around us is replete with simple pleasures that can change us for the\
  \ better in even the smallest of doses. After all, the whole point of eating a mango\
  \ naked in a stream is to actually enjoy it \u2013 uninterrupted, immersed in its\
  \ sensual pleasures, and absorbed by the aesthetics of our world, all while the\
  \ pulsing waters of life literally and figuratively rush past us."
