Text: I traveled to Chennai recently for a friend's wedding whom I met only once during
  a Ladhak trip which had seventeen women together. Yes sounds like a challenge.  So
  coming back to Chennai.  We landed in the afternoon and it was humid and very sunny.  The
  first place we stopped was a restaurant which had a thaali which means five to seven
  Varieties of curries with dosa(south Indian bread).  Looking at them the first thought
  u get is they look very hard on the exterior but as I stayed there I realized that
  they were pretty friendly and honest helpers.  I came across a rickshaw guy who
  was willing to take me to my hotel as I had less money return and when the guys
  who I asked to drop me said no less money.  But this guy was so generous that he
  offered me a ride with the money I offered me.  The journey was long but because
  he OK a chance of being less paid, I genuinely felt happy that I reached my hotel
  safely and I gifted him my sun glasses for the generosity he showed for me being
  a stranger.  Chennai..  Nandri...  Means Thankyou in Tamil
