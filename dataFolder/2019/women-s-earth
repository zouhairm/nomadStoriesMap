Text: 'To shorten the story, we travel through rural areas in 4 countries: Jamaica,
  Guatemala, Argentina and Brazil. We went "on the road" to talk about the women who
  work on the earth, to the earth with heart. Our wishes are to give them notability,
  visibility and we did it.


  In this tour of inner Latin America, we''ve found strong women and strong images.
  Is impressive how they have a peculiar sense of life, but at the same time represent
  any woman in the world. Because they have all the values that women from anywhere
  are trying to redeem to make life better and easier. I''m talking about unexplored
  female skills like empathy, sense of strength, connection to the cycle, and more..


  These women, of different ages (I try to say they are eternal, and not agelles,as
  they are from 15 to 70 years old) wear themselves gently. That means: with handmade
  clothes, transported by symbols and patrimony. All the colors they have chosen  -
  somehow - are linked to what they are and believe ... in other words with the Earth.


  Theirs relationship to nature is what I call true wealth. Forget "the glamorization
  of poverty". Think of the true wealth of women. t''s about a regional but global
  feeling.  Yes, I am positively amazed. That''s why  I would love to talk to you
  to share this special already published in Vogue Brasil. Find out more here (https://vogue.globo.com/lifestyle/cultura/noticia/2018/10/mulheres-em-campo-uma-viagem-pelas-americas-com-trabalhadoras-rurais-inspiradoras.html)'
