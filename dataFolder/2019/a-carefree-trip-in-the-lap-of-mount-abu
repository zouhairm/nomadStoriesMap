Text: "Once I thought of to tell them that our online waitlisted tickets had been\
  \ automatically cancelled but I did't want to loose this golden opportunity of my\
  \ 1st ever hill station trip with my best buddies. So I started our journey with\
  \ a fear in heart, but with fullest of  enthusiasm to be in the lap of nature alone,\
  \ without parents. But off course destination can't be beautiful without obstacles\
  \ in the journey. Train journey was terrible and had drained my buddies  enthusiasm\
  \ and energy,  but I was already dissolved in the unknown and unseen imaginary beauty\
  \ of Mount Abu. I was extremely excited but had a guilt and had a fear if mount\
  \ abu would stand out on their expectations and would be able to compensate this\
  \ unexpected miserable train journey. \nfinally  put our steps on the land of Hill,\
  \ only hill- station in the desert land  of Rajasthan. We all were tired but with\
  \ the first ray and cold breeze of Mount Abu we are were fresh.we were travelling\
  \ through in between of aravali hills, welcoming us with its incredible natural\
  \ beauty. Blue sky was touching the horizon and land as far as we could see. I took\
  \ my head out of the car window and smelt the freedom, took a deep carefree breath\
  \ of happiness.felt the touch of Nature and peace in the lap of serene and Beauty\
  \ of Aravali hills. We took hundreds of pics but none of our pic was good because\
  \ when you are with the real beauty of Earth it's only the nature who looks like\
  \ a Diva. With every car turning,we all were exclaiming\"wow...stop the car\" .\
  \ our driver Sahid smiled and replied\" this is only ten percent of it's beauty\"\
  . I felt the pain and sweat of those who shaped this rocks into beautiful road and\
  \ heart thanked them for making this heaven explorable for youngsters like us. No\
  \ body can explain even the 10percent of it's beauty because mind had stopped working\
  \ and soul wanted to dive in each smallest fraction of this moment.We trekked onto\
  \ Guru Shikhar and finally we were on the highest peak of the Rajasthan. After a\
  \ whole day of thrilled live shows of nature, excitement and peace we reached at\
  \ Nakki Lake. One of the most recommended place by everyone. But unfortunately we\
  \ didn't find anything that could add more to the Glory of Mt Abu. Mine three of\
  \ the friends chose to have a  round around local market. I and my younger brother\
  \ decided to take one more round of this lake.  Finally I saw a way which might\
  \ be secret door the the undiscovered beauty. We  both started climbing on the stairs\
  \ crushing scattered dry leaves. I hoped that it would not be more than a few steps\
  \ but I was wrong, as we were climbing high, the unknwon destination was climbing\
  \ higher, we were exhausted but then I saw the beauty of lake and called my friends\
  \ but warned them that please don't come because we might end with disappointment.\
  \ But they came and accompanied us. We were climbing and also checking time because\
  \ we were getting late as instructed by Sahid. Our speed geared up like high powered\
  \ motor and finally we reached at the top. We all were paused for few minutes by\
  \ seeing this hidden beauty of My Abu. From this point everything was visible. The\
  \ blue calm Nakki lake, Guru Shikhar, Dilwara temple, clean shinning bluish sky\
  \ and whole Mt Abu. This was the masterpiece. We all would have regretted if would\
  \ have missed this view. We were inside the cab again. I saw glow, excitement and\
  \ happiness on their faces and felt satisfied. Mount Abu was beyond their expectation\
  \ and no one had single second to recall that train incident. I again started capturing\
  \ beauty in my smartphone."
