Text: "The air was very heavy in Bangkok as the PM 2.5 pollutant indicator showed.\
  \ I thought a bit of escape from the world\u2019s most visited city would be nice.\
  \ What a luck! Miss Chaidee, a Thai woman whom I met on social media asked me to\
  \ join her for a trip to a place that Farangs (guava in literal translation, also\
  \ a referral to white foreigners) could not go on their own.\n\nIt took us two hours\
  \ and a half to reach Koh Kham, a beach isle just south of Pattaya but was not as\
  \ popular. A rustic yet somewhat reliable motorboat carried us from Mah Jor Port\
  \ to the secluded island. The boat was packed and we had to sit at the roof which\
  \ was no doubt the perfect place to get a breathtaking view during the short expedition.\n\
  \n\"What do you think?\" she asked as we took our first steps at the wood boardwalk\
  \ at Koh Kham dock. While admiring the view of white sand, coral rocks, feeling\
  \ the rather cool breeze under the scorching sun, I answered: \"It's nice\". \"\
  Yeah, cool\" she replied flatly.\n\nWe rushed uphill hoping to get the stunning\
  \ 360-degree view of the sea. Although there was an obvious clear trail and installed\
  \ boy scout splice rope tied between the trees, the climb to the top was not that\
  \ easy (at least for me particularly, a puffy guy).\n\nI greeted a Thai family that\
  \ we encountered with \"Sa wad dee krub\u201D which means \u201CHi\u201D in Thai\
  \ and they replied the same with some additional conversation in Thai language which\
  \ I, in any way, could not understand. Noticing my confused awkward expression,\
  \ they told something to Miss Chaidee that made her laugh. \"You are in Thailand,\
  \ you look like Thai, why you speak no Thai!\" she translated their words to me.\
  \ As I have the general Asian look, maybe, I wouldn\u2019t have to pay the foreigner\u2019\
  s price up to five times higher compared to local\u2019s fee when entering national\
  \ parks or temples if only I know some Thai words.\n\n\"Whatever it takes!\" Miss\
  \ Chaidee exclaimed as we reached the top point of the island where we could see\
  \ the vast blue ocean with no limit to be seen. She talked about her past, on how\
  \ she struggled to break impossibilities of poverty. She was the only person with\
  \ a university degree from her village. Through scholarship, dating an elderly Swiss\
  \ man who paid for her studies, to changing her major because her lecturer in hospitality\
  \ school said she was too smart. She is now an accomplished programmer.\n\nAs we\
  \ went back to the shore, \"Let's go Kayaking\" she asked, \"I'll pay for it, I\
  \ insist\" I replied. Without a doubt, she could pay on her own but this was one\
  \ way I could thank her for bringing me to this trip. While we paddled farther from\
  \ the shore, staggeringly huge black sea urchins were catching our attention. Ms.\
  \ Chaidee told me that the Royal Thai Navy might lift up the quota of visitors to\
  \ the preserved island because the ruling military junta would need every vote this\
  \ coming March 2019 election to secure the seats in the government. Indeed, there\
  \ is no better place to talk about national politics than in the middle of the sea.\n\
  \nNothing complemented better than freshly pressed orange juice after fun sport.\
  \ \"Cheers for a better Thailand\" amid the battle between the red shirt \"anti-elite\
  \ \u201Cand yellow shirt \"royalist-nationalist\" voters who are going to decide\
  \ the future of Thailand. Whatever happens, I believe that Miss Chaidee and the\
  \ rest of Thai people wants unity. As orange as the juice and the sunset that blended\
  \ in front of our eyes."
