Text: "Tikal. I had never heard of this place before.\nA few years ago, I have traveled\
  \ to Guatemala and discovered this place simply by asking the locals what were the\
  \ most beautiful sites to visit in their country. So it was as I undertook a journey\
  \ of more than 9 hours from the Capital to reach the place that promised an enormous\
  \ connection with nature and the Mayan ancestors.\n\nI was with a Colombian friend.\
  \ To have a full-experience of the place, we stayed inside the Jungle. We arrived\
  \ at night and, therefore, the room had neither light nor hot water. For those who\
  \ are used to the life of the big city... First Shock!\n\nAt bedtime, I see on the\
  \ wall more than one lizard. For those who don't like much vermin\u2026 Third Shock!\
  \ It was not easy to sleep.\n\nClosing the eyes to try to sleep start some frightening\
  \ howls that looked like lions, although they were monkeys. Third Shock! It was\
  \ not easy to sleep.\n\nWe woke up at 4am to make a tour in the darkness through\
  \ the jungle, which led us to the highest point from the ruins to see the sunrise.\
  \ It was one of the most incredible and spiritual places I have been. There, in\
  \ the middle of the jungle, at the highest point of the main center of the Mayan\
  \ empire, watching the sun's rays peek out and gradually of that dazzling view.\
  \ What energy!\nWe returned to the hotel. Happy, grateful and blessed by that luminosity.\
  \ We were tired, sleeping the night before had not been easy and we had woken up\
  \ early, so we decided to sleep a few hours to return to the park to explore the\
  \ ruins.\nWe did not arrive on time and the tour-guide had already left. Therefore,\
  \ we decided to do the route alone, the roads were marked, it would be easy, we\
  \ thought.\nWe went hiking, at our own pace and chatting about life. Suddenly, I\
  \ saw between the green of the forest something that moved and looked at us. For\
  \ a moment, I thought I was hallucinating, for having slept little, but I quickly\
  \ realized that I was seeing well. I stopped. I asked my friend simply: \u2018are\
  \ you seeing the same as me?\u2019, \u2018Yes\u2019, she answered me. It was a cougar,\
  \ those that all tour-guides longed to see every day of his life.\nImmediately and\
  \ intuitively, I turned in the opposite direction and started running. My heart\
  \ was coming out. A puma in front of me. Something I never thought could happen\
  \ to me. I had no more than a cell phone without connection in the middle of the\
  \ jungle. I did not know what should be done in those situations. Fourth and big\
  \ Shock!\n\nBut clearly, the despair was ours. The cougar very slowly did nothing\
  \ but look at us and continue on his way. Running, nervous, we reached the exit\
  \ point of the park. A guide asks us what happened to us? We came running but almost\
  \ paralyzed, scared. We told him that we had just seen a cougar and with his best\
  \ smile he told us \u2018what a blessing!\u2019\n\nFor several hours and even for\
  \ several days, the image of the cougar did not go out of our heads. You never go\
  \ out sightseeing, even in the jungle, thinking that you are going to see a puma\
  \ and that, on top of that, you will be alone not knowing what to do. \nThe next\
  \ day, a group of friends made the same tour of the Park and it seems that when\
  \ one of the people asked: \u2018are there any cougars around here?\u2019 The guide\
  \ answered, \u2018yes, there is. They never let themselves be seen, but yesterday\
  \ one of them appeared to an Argentinian and a Colombian woman who walked alone.\u2019\
  \n\nTo this day I can clearly remember that image and feeling, what a mixture of\
  \ feelings! fear, adrenaline, gratitude. Anyway ... when you leave the famous comfort\
  \ zone you can find and have the most unexpected experiences. This, without any\
  \ doubt, was one of them, something I never thought could ever happen to me."
