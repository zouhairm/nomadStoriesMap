Text: "Lying on the ramparts of Mehrangar Fort, Jodhpur, in a colonial British army\
  \ uniform, was not an experience I envisioned when planning my journey to India.\
  \ Two orange flares and a smoke machine were blowing an inordinate amount of smoke\
  \ into my unblinking eyes as I played dead, trying not to tear up, because I didn\u2019\
  t think corpses cried.\n\u201CCan you move your legs a bit? I don\u2019t want to\
  \ trip.\u201D Not exactly the kind of conversations I had envisioned, either. Then\
  \ again, I didn\u2019t think I would be talking to Katrina Kaif, one of India\u2019\
  s highest-paid actresses. Just a few feet away stood Amitabh Bachchan and Aamir\
  \ Khan, two more of Bollywood\u2019s biggest stars, recognizable to almost anyone\
  \ in the country.\nIt was around 3 a.m. on the set of Thugs of Hindostan and I had\
  \ been acting for nine hours. If you count standing still in military formation\
  \ or lying still, playing dead as acting, that is. \nThis strange circumstance was\
  \ preceded by another about 18 hours earlier. I was waiting for my food at an omelette\
  \ stand outside the fort when a man approached me with an opportunity. Hearing his\
  \ explanation involving his brother and/or cousin, a need for white men, an overnight\
  \ movie shoot, and cash payment, I was hesitant. But I agreed to meet him at the\
  \ fort later, and when I arrived, I saw I was among good company. Well, company,\
  \ at least.\nThere were several dozen other Western travelers, who had heard about\
  \ the shoot in various ways. We were herded towards hair and makeup to receive our\
  \ costumes and makeovers, and get ready for being on camera. I got anxious watching\
  \ some of the other extras getting their beards and mustaches trimmed or shaved\
  \ to look more authentic as colonial soldiers. But luckily my face was left alone\
  \ and I just had to tuck my long hair up underneath my army hat.\nDuring our 2 a.m.\
  \ lunch a number of extras decided to leave, discouraged by the tedium of standing\
  \ still for shot after shot, hour after hour. This left more opportunity for me\
  \ in the more interesting scenes after lunch, and I volunteered to go up on the\
  \ ramparts with the big-name actors when the assistant director asked. \nLying with\
  \ my face not three feet from the smoke-producing devices that were assaulting my\
  \ eyes, I wondered if I had made the right decision. A few minutes earlier I had\
  \ looked over the rampart and saw that the other extras were engaging in mock battle\
  \ with a slew of stuntmen, practicing for another scene. The assistant director\
  \ had seen me doing this, taking the same pose as him as he looked down, and had\
  \ admonished me for putting my foot up on the rampart wall like him. A muscular,\
  \ tattooed South African who probably ate nails for breakfast, he knew how to use\
  \ his authority to frightening effect. But I was glad I was up there, because I\
  \ figured being on camera with the biggest stars was the best way of making the\
  \ final cut.\nI haven\u2019t seen the movie yet, so I don\u2019t know if I did make\
  \ it on screen, but that doesn\u2019t really matter. I\u2019ll always have the experience.\
  \ Interacting with local and foreign extras, directors, special effects technicians,\
  \ makeup artists and global superstars, it was one of the most unique adventures\
  \ in my life. It was also the hardest I\u2019ve worked for $20 in my life.\nI didn\u2019\
  t enter India expecting anything like this, though I shouldn\u2019t have been surprised\
  \ when it happened. India is a country where things like this can happen anytime,\
  \ anywhere. It is a beautiful, diverse, exciting place where the unusual finds the\
  \ traveler at every turn. India surprised me, shocked me, and compelled me to expand\
  \ my views and my inclinations every day I spent there. \nIn fact, I should have\
  \ almost expected the question I received, eight days later and several hundred\
  \ miles away in remote northern Gujarat. I had come across a group of people, all\
  \ wearing the same hats and gathered around expensive-looking equipment. One of\
  \ them approached me. \u201CDo you want to be in a movie?\u201D"
