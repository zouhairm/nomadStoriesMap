Text: "From my bedroom window, I see the blistering winds hurtling rain across the\
  \ dark Roman evening. Every so often, a rumble echoes through the gale. Water steadily\
  \ seeps through the cracks in the shutters. Training couldn\u2019t possibly be on\
  \ in this weather. \n\nMy phone buzzes beside me: \n\n'C'\xE8 il calcio, a presto!\
  \ \U0001F60A'\n \nAnother rumble booms outside. In Sydney, the weather would\u2019\
  ve closed fields for a month! \n\nThe next minute, sporting an oversized raincoat\
  \ and borrowed sneakers, I was walking incredulously to soccer training. \n\nIt\u2019\
  s a short walk from my run-down student apartment to Campo Benedetto XV, the field.\
  \ Along the way, I dash across the tram line, through a rare break in the traffic.\
  \ The pavement is glistening with rain, mingling with shattered glass and streaks\
  \ of rubbish. The path off the main road has no streetlights, and even though it\
  \ is only 6.50pm, its almost pitch black. I pull out my phone, shielding it from\
  \ the rain, and follow its small light along the road.\n\nThe training field is\
  \ enclosed by a tinted pink wall, with rows of graffiti-ed women painted along its\
  \ side. When I first arrived, the mural was pristine \u2013 now, it is scrawled\
  \ with tags and chipped away. There is a new mural, across the road, rallying against\
  \ domestic violence. In the first month I started training with Atletico San Lorenzo,\
  \ the team rallied together in response to the rape and murder of a young girl in\
  \ the local area. The headlights of passing cars illuminate the row of women, steadfast\
  \ as the rain runs down them.  \n\nAs I arrive, I\u2019m confronted by the resolute\
  \ figure of the head coach. She is standing in the downpour, grey hair already soaked,\
  \ lit cigarette in hand, gesticulating to three of the girls on the field. They\
  \ are weaving between themselves, offloading perfectly placed passes, received and\
  \ pummelled towards the goal. They play to a steady stream of Italian.  \n\nAlthough\
  \ I\u2019ve been training with Atletico for the past 3 months, I\u2019m still not\
  \ sure whether to join this pre-training exercise. There is always so much laughter\
  \ and I\u2019m never sure who it\u2019s directed at. \n\nThankfully, the rest of\
  \ the team surges through the fence at that moment, all wearing navy-blue team raincoats.\
  \ The patter of incomprehensible Italian surges. I smile, try not to make eye contact.\
  \ \n\nThen the training begins. \n\nThe core squad, me straggling behind, starts\
  \ with the set pieces. Wisps of fog rise from the rain-soaked players. At a command,\
  \ they break into four lines. One of the girls motions at me to follow her. She\
  \ gestures, between the lines, to the ball, to the goals. I nod, uncomprehending.\
  \  \n\nIn the whole session, I probably understood two words (Passe! and Tira!)\
  \ \n\nBy 10pm, the rain has eased and there are smiles and chattering amongst the\
  \ squad. While the girls huddle and drink, collecting their bags, I realise that\
  \ I am becoming audience to an announcement.\n\nI try to press myself against the\
  \ wire-fence, show I know this was a squad matter. But I could tell that this wasn\u2019\
  t about football. The girls didn\u2019t usually make announcements, and Valeria\
  \ was talking. Her body was stiff and straight-backed, even more so in her fitted\
  \ shirt. She looked smaller amongst the buzzing energy of the warm-down.  \n\nThe\
  \ coach\u2019s reaction struck me first \u2013 usually, with a cigarette or command\
  \ on her lips, she looked harsh, intimidating. Now she looked her 60 years. Next\
  \ to her, the keeper stood shaking her head, unable to look at anyone. \n\nShe had\
  \ tears in her eyes. Her posture was crumbling. As she trailed to silence, the team\
  \ huddled closer. Arms reached out, submerging her. But a moment later, she pulled\
  \ herself free. She backed away as the team crowded her in with comfort - she didn\u2019\
  t want to fall apart. Her voice, even as it made no sense, sounded cracked. She\
  \ disappeared into the dark with a 'ciao'. \n\nEveryone was silent. A few players\
  \ jogged after her. The girl who sometimes translates for me (whose name I still\
  \ don\u2019t know) was frowning to herself. I couldn\u2019t ask, like I usually\
  \ did, for a translation."
