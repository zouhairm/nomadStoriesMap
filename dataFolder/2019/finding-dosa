Text: "In Mumbai, there is an availability of food with quality taste in every second\
  \ lane thus it never occurred to me that I should equip myself before leaving the\
  \ hotel.  Also my tour guide instilled the faith in me that she shall take care\
  \ of my survival. To be rest assured I had clarified, \"No meat, No fish, not even\
  \ eggs....Only vegetarian\"\nSirdi, which at first sounded to me like Shridi. I\
  \ did try to ask her what was the meaning of her name but maybe we had a language\
  \ barrier or maybe she refused to be friendly. She would always cuss whenever I\
  \ made an error while pronouncing her name.\nI was the sole traveler but I had two\
  \ more families with me and they had kids and they were not less than tiny demons.\
  \ They were pure annoyance throughout the day.\nIt was a bright sunny day in Macau\
  \ and only Sirdi had a dome shaped umbrella to her rescue. I wished if she could\
  \ share it with me, she was of my mother's age maybe she could be a little kind.\n\
  \"Just ten minutes to visit the historic temple, If you not here in ten minutes,\
  \ I leave with others\" She said it in her typical accent and we all nodded.\nI\
  \ paid my respects to the divine and I was there near the bus in five minutes. I\
  \ saw her talking over the phone, it was extremely hard to depict what she meant\
  \ in her local language but I could feel she was tense and something was disturbing\
  \ her. When her call ended, I asked her if everything was okay to which she said\
  \ \"Yes, now in the bus, next stop after thirty mins\"\nWe visited few more places\
  \ as we followed Sirdi's strict time limit.  As the sun was setting and our day\
  \ tour was coming to an end she told us in a very commanding voice, \"Either I will\
  \ drop you at your hotel or at the Indian restaurant\"\nI have been starving since\
  \ morning, my breakfast was only two slim slices of bread.  I agreed for the Indian\
  \ restaurant as the food outside is cheaper than the Hotel which was no less than\
  \ a palace where vegetarian food prices were extraordinarily high.\nShe left me\
  \ at the market place and instructed me that I shall find the Indian restaurant\
  \ at the end of the street and I got down and started to walk. As I was walking,\
  \ my stomach made the growling sounds. According to her it was a south Indian restaurant\
  \ and I had already imagined dosa in my head with the coconut chutney.\nI reached\
  \ the end of the street but there were no traces of any restaurant.  I was cursing\
  \ Sirdi for being so mean to a hungry vegetarian human being. \nI guess I would\
  \ have fainted, the worst part was I also lost my way back to the Hotel. It was\
  \ no more fun, I was petrified, it was around 11 am and everything gets very quiet\
  \ by that time.\nNow finding the hotel was more important than the Dosa, somehow\
  \ I was trying to locate the hotel with the meager amount of battery life left in\
  \ my phone.\nI could find few men lurking and mocking with the cigarettes. Maybe\
  \ I should switch the lane or maybe not.  My hands were cold, I was feeble as I\
  \ took tiny steps and then I took a deep breath and took a few rapid steps. In those\
  \ few minutes I could imagine all the worst things that could have happened to me\
  \ but nothing happened.\nNothing happened, I turned back and could see that they\
  \ were joking amongst themselves.  I felt a sign of relief as I reached the hotel\
  \ room and blew up extra dollars for a dosa.\nI pulled the blanket and embraced\
  \ the comfort. I wished Sirdi had given me right instructions, maybe she had a messed\
  \ up life which compelled her to be like that. For a moment I could feel my life\
  \ was at stake but in this pursuit of Finding Dosa I could find that I was capable\
  \ enough to handle the rough situations."
