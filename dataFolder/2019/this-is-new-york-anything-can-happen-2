Text: "I open the door plastered with posters of Nelson Mandela, Nigerian football\
  \ players, Biggie Smalls, and walk in the sound of Yoruba high life music. The room\
  \ is large, long and lit with fluorescents. The walls are the orange of sunsets,\
  \ and golden yellow of ripe mangoes from top to bottom except for an exposed brick\
  \ on the right above which hung was a black sign on which was printed in large block\
  \ letters \u201CMOSHOOD\u201D. The walls were covered in framed photographs. \n\n\
  There is a black man with a white beard dressed head to toe in black, holding a\
  \ bowl in one hand, his right hand dipped in it. He has two rows of small red beads,\
  \ and a large black beads interspersed with brown, holding a large metal pendant\
  \ of the Yoruba face mask. He puts the bowl down, as I enter. I walk the short distance\
  \ to him.\n \u201CHello, thank you. Are you Moshood?\u201D\n\u201CYes, I am\u201D\
  . \nI sigh as I sit and we began to talk about home. \n \u201CSo, you\u2019re from\
  \ here, or from home?\n\u201CNo, I\u2019m from home. I\u2019ve only been here, for\
  \ like, since 2016\u201D\n\u201Cwow, so you\u2019re a real Nigerian?\nI laugh and\
  \ respond, \u201CI\u2019m a real Nigerian woman. \n\u201Cwhat part of Nigerian are\
  \ you from? \nEh? He repeats the question\n\u201CI\u2019m ibo. I\u2019m form Anambra\
  \ state.\u201D\nHe reacts as most people do by asking me a question in my language\
  \ \u201CKedu?\u201D\n\u201CO dinma, \u2026 \u201Cokay\u201D\n\u201CKe ka-imelu?\
  \ \nHe slaps his knee, and looks at me his eyes white, and his teeth flashing against\
  \ his dark skin. \u201CDon\u2019t make me laugh\u201D\nAs we speak I look around,\
  \ the store at the pictures.  Models in various Moshood outfits. There is a woman\
  \ in Moshood tshirt, with see through black bum shorts; another with a Moshood wrapper\
  \ around her waist, her upper body is bare, her nipples were drawn as eyes, with\
  \ the nipples being the pupils, a large, blunt nose drawn down her stomach to her\
  \ belly button, and wide, full lips beneath it.\n\n\u201CHow long has your store\
  \ been here? \u201C\n\u201C25.\u201D \u201C25 years\u2026\u201D \u201CYeh, the store\
  \ is older than you.\u201D\n \u201CCongratulations\u201D I say. \n\u201CThank you,\
  \ thank you.\u201D\n\u201CDid you move here.\u201D \u201CYeh I live here now.\u201D\
  \ \n\u201CI\u2019m wondering what country did you move from?\n\u201CI moved directly\
  \ from Lagos.\u201D \u201CReally?\u201D\n\u201CYes. I\u2019m a Lagos boy.\u201D\n\
  I laugh. Tell him my family and I live in Lagos. \n\u201CSurulere side. Isale eko\
  \ side, I was born there.  Original. I\u2019m areal Mushin boy\u201D.\n\u201COriginal\
  \ omo ni ile\u201D (son of the soil) He laughs, again, stomping his foot severally\
  \ against the g \n\u201CWhen you came did you intend to start this store or I just\
  \ hapopend?\u2019\n\u201Cit just happened.  I was young\u2026 I mean when you come\
  \ from Nigeria like that, starting a store is not in your head, but you have a plan\
  \ to progress. And whatever comes through that, he opens his hand in acceptance\
  \ titling his head to one side, so it happened.\n\n\nSo here I am a Nigerian Christian\
  \ experimenting with kale and butternut squash and steel prongs, searching for a\
  \ story and arriving at blood sweat and tears of Moshood eating with his finishing\
  \ a bowl of soup with fried fish and chicken bone with his hands. rooted in Yoruba\
  \ traditional religion. I have come all the way from Lekki to Brooklyn to face,\
  \ for the first time,  the gods of my city. \n\nIt was like the music, when the\
  \ drum calls, your blood answers. When the drum calls, you feel it in your blood,\
  \ and you answer, your waist sways one way then the other and you know that the\
  \ call is beyond the music. I have been struggling with this dialectic, how to be\
  \ African, and Christian. How does the art exist without the spirits? I don\u2019\
  t know. But I hope I find out. I hope  I find out. I open the door. And leave. \n\
  \u201CIt\u2019s your home now\u201D, Moshood says\n\u201CSafe travels\u201D, Suru\
  \ says\n\nI turn on my Christian playlist of spontaneous worship in Yoruba oriki.\
  \ I wave, I walk out. It\u2019s late evening now. Everyone is still in a hurry.\
  \ The horns honk, a Mercedes turns down the street. People and bicycles riding down\
  \ the street. A police car races and his siren races behind him. A beeline bus,\
  \ turns a corner to pick up more tired commuters. Down jackets and paper bags from\
  \ whole foods walking somewhere, it\u2019s New York! I turn towards the subway,\
  \ going, home."
