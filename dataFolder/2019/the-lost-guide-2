Text: "\u201CWhy are you pulling over?\u201D I ask Namkha, our driver cum guide. He\
  \ does not bother to give me a reply and just gestures towards the road above us.\
  \ I see nothing in a fleeting glance. As I try to fathom what made him stop, my\
  \ sister chimes loudly, \u201COo it\u2019s a convoy.\u201D I take a closer look\
  \ and see the tiny specks of black moving amidst the snowy walls of the Himalayas\
  \ and grey pathways. The convoy is at a distance and the ginormous trucks appear\
  \ to be miniscule. Their distant rumbling noise is analogous to the sound of the\
  \ gyrating Buddhist prayer wheels. I am awestruck by Namkha\u2019s ability to see\
  \ the juggernauts from a distance while they camouflage with the arduous terrain.\
  \ \nThe presence of militia fits well to the strategic jigsaw of Ladakh. Just like\
  \ the Karakoram Ranges the men in uniform stand tall and sturdy, looming over the\
  \ barbed borders. While the presence of the protectors seem to be mundane to the\
  \ land of mystics it continues to intimidate me. My first encounter with the subduing\
  \ began as soon as I set foot on the tarmac of the Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport,\
  \ a mammoth Boeing C-17 Globemaster stood before me. Even from a distance I felt\
  \ like Mercury, beside Jupiter. If not its sight, the grating roar of its engines\
  \ will cover one in goose-flesh.\n When we had planned on visiting the moon landscape,\
  \ I had pictured Lamas\u2019 in Monasteries hauntingly moving about the temples\
  \ humming chants in a language foreign to me. Peace and sanctity impending in the\
  \ surroundings and silence penetrating the walls with the occasional ringing bell\
  \ breaking the enchantment.  Upon witnessing the army deployed there in heaps, it\
  \ offered a stark contrast to what I had imagined and what was in real. The experience\
  \ of watching these armed men at work was exhilarating for me. Several times during\
  \ the journey we had parked ourselves on the side of the road waiting for these\
  \ loaded battalions to pass by and I had noticed Namkha standing there watching\
  \ them with an expression in his eyes that I could not comprehend. What was it?\
  \ Respect? Pride? Or was it something completely different \u2026 desolation? I\
  \ concluded it was all. An intensity in his eyes that spoke more than words could\
  \ articulate but it was still unfathomable.\n The same expression marks his features\
  \ yet again as we take a halt on the roadside. The look marring his features makes\
  \ me curious. I lean on our tour bus gazing at him trying to look for an answer,\
  \ a puzzle I believe I will never solve. Jamyang, a fellow driver of Namkha and\
  \ his best friend stands beside me smoking. Jamyang\u2019s eyes flitter towards\
  \ Namkha and he utters, \u201CHe misses his father.\u201D Jamyang and I feel uncomfortable\
  \ in our silence. He flicks the cigarette butt and walks away while I contemplate.\
  \ The chains wrapped around the truck wheels clam deafeningly now. I glance at my\
  \ father and envision what if one day he left for work and came back wrapped in\
  \ the Tricolour. My heart weeps as my mind banishes the thought."
