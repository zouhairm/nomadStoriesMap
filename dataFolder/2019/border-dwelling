Text: "I hadn\u2019t been back for over ten years. It had become unavoidable the moment\
  \ you said were from the United states. The wall. Tijuana and San Diego, a cultural,\
  \ geographical continuum that has become famous by what divides it. It\u2019s shared\
  \ border is \u201Cthe busiest land crossing in the world\u201D, the panels proudly\
  \ tell you at the border entrances. I vaguely remember this from one of the visits\
  \ we made over when I was a kid - one of those unusual events in childhood that\
  \ you look forward to because of the hustle, the promise of palletas, and the chance\
  \ at hearing your mother speak her native tongue in its full fluency. Tijuana\u2019\
  s skyline disappears into a hilly horizon, and the thick muddle of the city emerging\
  \ from those hills was, back then, just a backdrop. \nThe view is so much vaster\
  \ revisiting it. Tijuana does justice to the word sprawling - thousands of lights,\
  \ signs of so many lives, highlight all the more a thick miasma of streets, buildings,\
  \ highways.\n\nA friend tells us stories over coffee in San Ysidro. The \u201Cmigrant\
  \ caravan\u201D has dispersed, and was now taking up Tijuana\u2019s unwanted jobs;\
  \ at the border life settles and survives.\n\nMy mother lives 15 minutes away. In\
  \ the parking lots outside of Wal-Mart men in dusty hats wait patiently under mid-morning\
  \ suns. They wait on potential employers passing-by, their garden\u2019s parched\
  \ demeanor or their roof\u2019s leaks - promises of a day\u2019s pay. \n\nMy mother\
  \ cares for my grandmother. She has been basking in this sun for decades, but my\
  \ mother wants to move her to her birthplace, east of Baja and slightly into the\
  \ interior. Yet she is old. She curses us in her lilting Spanish each time we try\
  \ to take her outside. \u201CUstedes no me aman, no me cuidan\u201D she says, her\
  \ eyes darkening. \n\nIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day. We take her across the border\u2013\
  \ no passport checks on entry \u2013 to visit our friend and his mother, once a\
  \ young woman close to my grandma, also once living in these dusty streets, trying\
  \ to fund an idea of a worthwhile future. \nOur visit is brief \u2013 their house,\
  \ high in those hills, too small and cold to shelter all of us. We linger in their\
  \ courtyard, among their avocado and lemon trees. \n\nOur friend offers to accompany\
  \ us to the border as twilight falls. It\u2019s line curves through the city\u2019\
  s western boulevards, falls into motorways where cars edge along the emergency lane\
  \ for miles, engines turned off. \u201CI have never seen it come out this far\u201D\
  \ our friend says. \nIt\u2019s New Year\u2019s Day \u2013 we knew that. The government\
  \ is shutdown, and we\u2019ve unwittingly found ourselves in the middle of that\
  \ wrangling issue of over-funding to fill in the border\u2019s gaps eastwards. Ironically,\
  \ border agents may not be working. This is surreal, I yell to a conjured hoard\
  \ of the President\u2019s supporters \u2013 come down and see for yourselves - what\
  \ do your distinctions have anything to do with us, the border-dwellers? I fantasize\
  \ to pass the time. \n\nWe buy churros from street vendors trudging through the\
  \ cars, deep into the night. They are impressive, insistent, everywhere. It must\
  \ be cold outside. \nOur crossing takes less than 2 minutes. We all have US passports,\
  \ that abstract green-light across the border. The agent does not smile, and we\
  \ speed back to the apartment that is less than 15 minutes away from this very spot.\
  \ The neighborhood is quiet, and the liquor shops are closed. It is past 3 am. We\
  \ waited some 10 hours to cross this border. This border, this wall - in one of\
  \ contemporary politics\u2019 most potent arguments, a symbol of simplicity. \n\
  But - I yell, my imaginary voice cracking \u2013 it has always been complicated\
  \ - over here has always been part of Mexico. It won\u2019t change. We have always\
  \ spoken some version of Spanish, and we will always have a family member or friend\
  \ who cannot cross over \u2013 and it will always feel like an unnatural thing.\n\
  \nI leave California, slow-burning, and fly back to London. I am very easily no\
  \ longer a border-dweller \u2013 but many other do not have this luxury. I feel\
  \ lucky, and I feel unlucky."
