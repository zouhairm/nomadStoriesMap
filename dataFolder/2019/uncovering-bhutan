Text: "Uncovering Bhutan\n\nEyes open early, ready for departure to Bhutan's Paro\
  \ Airport. We experience one of the most exhilarating journeys by air in the world.\
  \ Only a handful of highly skilled Bhutanese pilots are accredited to fly this route.\
  \ Flanked by the majestic Himalaya, we commence our approach from the south between\
  \ the forested peaks guarding the valley. Dropping further into the approach path,\
  \ a number of precise corrections line us up with a narrow river valley. By now,\
  \ our wing tips are caressing the updrafts from below, gliding level with the houses\
  \ built along this beautiful valley. Touchdown brings a frisson of adrenalin fuelled\
  \ excitement. \n\nWe are welcomed from the aircraft by our guide Ugyen. He is resplendent\
  \ in the official national dress of Bhutan, the gho. All important business is conducted\
  \ wearing the gho. Dress is paramount and it is important that the white cuffs on\
  \ the outfit should always be kept immaculate.\n\nParo is built in traditional Bhutanese\
  \ style. Ornately carved and decorated exteriors compete for attention. Cameras\
  \ click as we spot a richly ornamented facade, complete with double 'Flying Thunderbolts'\
  \ flanking the doors. These phallic icons, were inspired by the 'Divine Madman',\
  \ a guru who used humour and outrageous behaviour to teach the Buddhist message.\
  \ He was reputed to defeat evil demons by using his powerful member.\n\nUgyen guides\
  \ us to Paro Dzong, a magnificent fortress, set on a strategic hill, guarding the\
  \ river crossing. Inside the internal courtyard is dominated by a tall keep.  The\
  \ outer walls are lined with rooms, opening onto tiered verandas now occupied by\
  \ monks. \n\nShedding shoes, we climb a few steps to the temple on one side of the\
  \ courtyard. Stepping onto the floor, I feel the wood smoothly polished and see\
  \ the gorgeous golden patina of the surface, worn by thousands of feet over the\
  \ ages. \n\nWe revel in the garden of this beautiful Shangri-La while wandering\
  \ down to the river crossing at the ancient covered bridge. We all relax into an\
  \ easy ambience, for tomorrow we start our first acclimatisation hike.\n\nRested,\
  \ we are ready to tackle the reputedly challenging hike to the Tiger's Nest monastery.\
  \ Reaching a meadow at the track head, saddled horses wait patiently to transport\
  \ pilgrims, but we're keen to stretch our legs.  \n\nInto the forest, we come across\
  \ a picturesque water-driven prayer wheel. One may take a peaceful moment of contemplation\
  \ accompanied by the sound of the mountain stream as the flow turns the wheel sedately.\n\
  \nFurther on, we reach a large pilgrim operated prayer wheel, set with a distant\
  \ view of the monastery. The path steepens through the forest now. On turning a\
  \ corner, we are presented with a breathtaking view of the Tiger's Nest from across\
  \ a narrow chasm. The monastery, perched on a precipitous cliff side ledge, is about\
  \ 500m from the floor of the Paro Valley. This is the classic scene depicting idyllic\
  \ Bhutan. We negotiate the narrow steps downwards to reach the incline up to the\
  \ entrance. Here, we are met and searched by friendly but thorough police officers.\
  \ There is a strict no-photo policy inside the buildings. Inside, ornate temple\
  \ rooms are tended faithfully by the few monks who reside there. Higher up can be\
  \ seen hermit buildings which house those who are dedicated to a contemplative life.\n\
  \nThis rocky outcrop is a holy place for Buddhist devotees. Shoes were shed outside\
  \ and a respectful audience heard Ugyen tell the story of Guru Rinpoche. During\
  \ his meditation time here in the 8th century, his female consort was transformed\
  \ into a flying tigress, thus giving the name to the monastery. Rinpoche is credited\
  \ with introducing Buddhism into Bhutan using tantric principles to spread wisdom\
  \ and defeat evil.  At the heart of the monastery is the guru's cave.  The entrance\
  \ is sealed by a golden screen only opened one day per year. \n\nBy now, with a\
  \ sense of awed calm we were all happy to collect our cameras and walk down to lunch\
  \ at the restaurant halfway down the mountain.\n\nLooking back at the bare rock\
  \ outcrop above the buildings, with a good imagination, one can see the face depicted\
  \ in ceremonial masks of the guru"
