Text: "When I was 16, I traveled to Jamaica. The minute I walked the roads, my heart\
  \ sang in my soles. Every step-step in the dirt and mud felt like the right direction.\
  \ Every house we passed felt as if I had been wrenched away from this place and\
  \ finally returned. When I was a child, I asked my grandmother where her family\
  \ had lived before America. She told me our family had come from Jamaica many years\
  \ ago. I felt connected, and years later when I visited, I had the strange feeling\
  \ of being at home in a foreign country. \n\nThere are photographs, though I know\
  \ not where they are. There was money that I gave away. The only things that still\
  \ linger from that trip are the only stamp in a soon-to-be-expired passport and\
  \ that feeling. I've only felt it one other place: my great aunt's farm in Alabama.\
  \ A pull to the earth, to the trees, as if they know secrets I do not. \n\nNow that\
  \ I'm older, my family tells me they do not know where we come from, and my grandmother\
  \ must have been joking when I was a child.  She is older now, does not remember.\
  \ I have no generational records, no paperwork, no way of knowing without what feels\
  \ like years of digging. One day, I will travel to many different countries and\
  \ search for that feeling of home again."
