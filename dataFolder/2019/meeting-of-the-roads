Text: After my graduation, i was only 19, i decided to leave my country and discover
  something totally different. I applied to a mission, i prepared my bag, and i took
  a flight to go to Riga in Latvia. Nobody has never heard about this country. Or
  it's very rare and special to meet someone from there. I was afraid, but very curious
  about  what i was going to see. I was looking for a paradise of nature, and to be
  part of. And step by step on this unknow earth, it was day after days, an extraordinary
  human aventure , taking trains by nights and trying to speaking a russian language..asking
  peoples about their life. Lonely in this little cold country, discovering about
  myself, having doubts, having dream, having loves. Most of the time living with
  a philosophy student. He was teaching me about life, History of the country, and
  geography. More i was moving far, and getting out from my My comfort zone. Almost
  visiting my own spirit. My mother said, never give up. Between festivals, this wonderful
  culture , dinner to local peoples, and hosted by others travellers. To city on city,
  i visited all of them. After 10months, And when the time was up. I said goodbye
  to this paradise, to travel somewhere else, coming back to reality, i should work
  and earn money. But i never forget how much it was nourrishing and exeptionnal to
  live it. Now, i continue to write on it.
