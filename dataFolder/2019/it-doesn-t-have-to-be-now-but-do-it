Text: "You are not going away just to learn another language or whatever you went\
  \ away to do. it doesn\u2019t matter for how long you choose to be away, nothing\
  \ will be the same. Most importantly you learn about yourself. It\xB4s you, being\
  \ put in the most weird and exciting situations only this time you don\u2019t have\
  \ your friends around to laugh with, you are by yourself. \nYou learn to appreciate\
  \ your friends and family and learn how to be alone and away from everything that\
  \ you know. You start missing things that you can\xB4t explain, like the smell of\
  \ their laugh, the sound of their hugs, you facetime with your friends, and you\
  \ miss them, truly miss them, Is that one hug that makes feel like you belong to\
  \ that place.\nYou learn to take care of yourself, in a really healthy way. Suddenly\
  \ you cook, you clean, and you appreciate the people who previously did it for you.\
  \ You get sick, probably will burn something or ruin your clothes in the washer,\
  \ but you are still there cause deep inside you know that is a part of the adventure,\
  \ a part of the process.\nEventually, the most amazing thing happens, being there\
  \ makes you feel like you are capable of great things, of things you didn\u2019\
  t know you wanted or liked. you make friends from all over the world and no matter\
  \ where they come from, no matter how they were raised, what their color is , their\
  \ religion is , they feel like family. You have just met people that speak the same\
  \ language that you do, a connection that doesn\u2019t have a logical reason.\n\
  You learn to love your new friends, even when you thought you had enough real ones,\
  \ and there you are, telling them about you, your dreams, your life, the battles\
  \ that you won and the ones that you lost, learning about them and planning a future\
  \ with no chance of not ever seeing each other again.\nWhen I took that plane, I\
  \ remember how scared I was about leaving my world behind, even when it was just\
  \ for a couple of months, when you say good bye to your new friends, its different.\
  \ Goodbyes are difficult and you know they are coming, but you don\u2019t expect\
  \ to love them that much for when the time comes.\nBeing away changed my life, made\
  \ my soul kinder, my heart and mind more open, my cooking full of spices, my mind\
  \ full of stories, made my facetime a font of happiness and I learn that when someone\
  \ is meant to be in your life, they take a piece of you and you keep a bit of them\
  \ with you.\nI learned that this world doesn\u2019t belong to us. That every corner\
  \ is full of stories, that every single person can teach you something, that you\
  \ should fall in love a hundred times just because, it\xB4s worth it, that nothing\
  \ is worth your peace, that the people who want you in their lives will show it\
  \ to you and that let go it`s a choice made by two.\nGo away, pack your things and\
  \ go, travel, open your eyes, try new food, talk to people, jump that fence and\
  \ fall, kiss the guy over and over again, loose the fear, dance on the beach, feel\
  \ alive, sleep less, laugh with your whole body, enjoy it, live it. Use your soul\
  \ to carry memories, use your mind to remember the way a touch felt and your heart\
  \ to grab all the things you learned and become a better person, not for them, for\
  \ you, just for you. No classroom will teach you how to feel, how to be kind, how\
  \ to be open. Fill yourself with experiences that will make your heart warm.\nDo\
  \ it, doesn\u2019t have to be now, but do it."
