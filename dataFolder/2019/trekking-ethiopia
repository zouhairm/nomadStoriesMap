Text: "Written 3/13/19 at 9:56pm\nAs I pulled my legs up the rain soaked hill, towards\
  \ the top of the mountain, boots and clothes soaked and backpack heavy. We were\
  \ walking behind the guide and behind us was the guard. He carried an Ak-47, or\
  \ at least that\u2019s what I think it was, and also a rainbow colored umbrella\
  \ and sported camo clothing with rubber sandals. Didn\u2019t speak a word of English\
  \ but I think he liked me or at least smiled and nodded. At the moment I was telling\
  \ him to take down his umbrella. There was lightning above and we were on top of\
  \ a mountain in a storm with zero trees. I was doing that thing where you count\
  \ the time between the flash and sound and it was anxiety provoking. The guide translated\
  \ my message and they both stared at me in confusion. Why would we take down our\
  \ umbrellas? The guide was also extremely nice and they took them down and sulked\
  \ on. The two of them could hike like it was nothing. We had been walking for days\
  \ through the Siemien Mountains in Ethiopia. Found a last minute trip and jumped\
  \ on a backpacking trip for a week. Trekking through high mountains greener than\
  \ Ireland. It was a strange land and we were in search of friendly baboons and Ibex\
  \ sightings along the cliffs. Nature was all around us, we were deep in the depths\
  \ of a flora and fauna fantasy. This area receives a lot of rain at this elevation,\
  \ near 11,000ft the air was thin and damp, the plants were strange. Sometimes we\
  \ would be above the tree cover walking through these lush valleys of rocks and\
  \ streams, odd palms about the size of a human. It was mesmerizing. And then there\
  \ were baboons. Mellowed by the effects of the high altitude, just staring at you\
  \ without care as you wander by in awe. They could care less eat sleep and fuck\
  \ was their agenda. We\u2019d come across viewpoints with cliffs and the guide would\
  \ talk about villages down in the valleys. He said the baboons aren\u2019t as friendly\
  \ further down and hence the need for the rifle. Almost it was handy for humans\
  \ that might want to rob or capture us, luckily neither of which occurred.\nWe kept\
  \ trekking through the storm, everything in my conscious was telling me how dumb\
  \ this was to go to the top of a mountain in a lighting storm. But we somehow made\
  \ it. Also at that moment the rain stopped, its as if it was purposely only raining\
  \ when we would hike. We made a fire and they had a cabin to warm up in and dry\
  \ off. But what I was most excited about was food. Not that it was good but that\
  \ I needed it to live to survive in this harsh climate. Everyday I was starved beyond\
  \ belief with the amount of calories burned to food consumed, a state of hiking\
  \ induced hypoglycemia. I had never looked forward more in my life to a meal and\
  \ would fight, hide and pull extreme measure (just kidding) for rations and try\
  \ to get seconds when the time came. In hindsight if I was to ever mountain trek\
  \ again I would bring my own supply of snacks and go hide in the woods and eat them.\
  \ \nWe came across some Ibex one day who was walking along the cliff side. When\
  \ we finally did reach the last camp, which was a small village, we were greeted\
  \ with such welcome. Everyone was exhausted and yet had a surge of energy. We\u2019\
  d made it, the hiking was over we could go back to relaxing on our vacation. Sometimes\
  \ people ask why would you pay and go struggle for a week and suffer in wetness,\
  \ pain, fatigue, blisters, hunger and more on a week of only a couple vacations\
  \ a year. But at this moment it all set in, the endorphins, the adrenaline, the\
  \ passion, the hikers high call it what you will but we felt alive.  They had beer\
  \ for sale and music and a big fire and people sang and danced."
