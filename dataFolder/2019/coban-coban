Text: "It was well into night when my ride dropepd my at the zocalo. The streetlights\
  \ were on in the square, and there were many dark figures laid atop benches, and\
  \ a strange dense quietness that I came to know later was unique to mountain towns.\n\
  \nEverything had a sense of interruption and interlude, as if things were out of\
  \ harmony. The cracked sidewalks bore shadows of tangled telephone wires and soaring\
  \ palm leaves, which themselves looked unnaturally shredded. Different colors of\
  \ tarps and sheets flittered discordantly above vendor booths where woman sat in\
  \ discolored lawn chairs having atonal conversations. I passed under a tunnel of\
  \ scaffolding along a street alive with bad intentions.\n\nFrom a church I heard\
  \ organ music and I crept cautiously towards the door. Excuse me, I said to a pastor,\
  \ do you think I can hang my hammock on the church grounds for the night? No, he\
  \ told me. Go ask the bomberos.\n\nI asked where the fire station was and headed\
  \ that way. The fireman were gathered at the sidewalk with the light of the station\
  \ at their backs, chatting the way men do at night in every Latin American town.\
  \ Buenas noches, I\u2019m passing through on my way to Coban, would it be okay if\
  \ I put up my hammock somewhere for the night? They appraised me, as if I was the\
  \ one out of place. One standing nearby came over and put his arm around my shoulders.\
  \ You can sleep with me, he said. I ducked away from his arm and kept walking.\n\
  \nI came upon a police station. There were three policemen in the office, one behind\
  \ a desk and two nearby. I came upon the desk and repeated my question. The officers\
  \ were alert, sober and inquisitive. Are you alone? How did you get here? Where\
  \ are you from? What are you doing here? I thought it a good question. I backed\
  \ away slowly saying nevermind, thank you, thanks, and went back into the street\
  \ looking for a clue to this string of bad luck. But the night was like a typewriter\
  \ with one key stuck punching a big inscrutable blob. No word, no sign, no message\
  \ in the night for me.\n\nThere were no cars on the road except a camioneta that\
  \ whispered cuidao as it passed, and the night was not getting any lighter. A cruiser\
  \ pulled up with two of the policemen from the station. They offered to take me\
  \ out of the city so that I had a better chance of catching a ride. We rode past\
  \ the city limits, past the district limits, past a fork in the road and over a\
  \ hill, where we could see the lume of alcaldes spread out over the sabana, and\
  \ in between, docile farmlands and a distant sierra.\n\nThey let me out in view\
  \ of the highway and I thanked them. It was too late to continue on the road. But\
  \ the moon was so bright, and the trees were still and casting broad shadows, and\
  \ I felt like walking, and I felt like singing. I\u2019ve been doing some hard travelling\
  \ I thought you know\u2019d... my pack felt heavier than usual. I rummaged through\
  \ it, found some rope I didn\u2019t think I needed anymore, and tossed it aside.\
  \ I threw out my old ripped jeans and a letter I was planning to send to Danny.\
  \ I departed from the highway, and climbed up, up a small hill where two wispy trees\
  \ stood as if put there for my hammock. I felt cool, and placid. I felt nothing\
  \ at all. A sensation of me, in-the-world, shaking the hand of an impassive benevolence.\
  \ \u201CI opened myself to the gentle indifference of the world, finding it so much\
  \ like myself.\u201D Where did I read that? Tonight is a long, long night and I\
  \ have a big desire to set the world on fire.\n\nI woke up at dawn to a group of\
  \ swart indigenous women poking me with a stick. Dormiendo? they whispered, confounded.\
  \ Es una gringa! I had fallen out of my hammock and was covered in dew.\n\nIt was\
  \ time for me to get to Coban."
