Text: "After spending a week in Thailand with my family I was finally heading to my\
  \ first solo trip of 2019. I am not a planner so consequently most of my trips are\
  \ last-minute-bookings-that-aren't-cheap. Traveling solo has always been my safe\
  \ space, my moment, my mental break from society. As I was sitting and waiting for\
  \ my flight to land I couldn't help myself by holding the anxiety inside of me.\
  \ I didn't want to be that person - you know, the person on the plane that doesn't\
  \ stop talking or snores too loud? yeah, I was that person for a moment. I started\
  \ chatting with this lady next me sharing some of the ideas and plans that I had\
  \ for my stay in Bali. She kindly shook her head as of \"ok ok I don't care but\
  \ yeah yeah\". \n\nOur flight finally landed in Denpasar and I got a cab to Ubud.\
  \ I found this great hostel that was one of those \"Luxury Hostels\" and I was amazed\
  \ by this hostel! It is usually the opposite: you see the pictures, read the reviews,\
  \ but this was the first time that the hostel was actually better than the pictures.\
  \ I met the folks that I was sharing the room with, took a shower and my adventure\
  \ begun. There is something very spiritual about Bali and especially in Ubud. Something\
  \ about the people, the bright and positive energy that you can only feel by walking\
  \ through the streets in Ubud. You can feel the calm breeze touching your skin -\
  \ maybe this is how freedom is supposed to feel like or maybe not. \n\nWalking around\
  \ the Ubud Market you can almost get lost with all the bamboo bags and it makes\
  \ you wonder of people flew all the way from their home just to purchase these bags.\
  \ I headed back to my hostel for a barbecue event sort of \"meet and greet\". And\
  \ I did meet great people indeed, from solo travelers, college friends, families\
  \ traveling together but most importantly, people trying to grow as a human being.\
  \ \n\nIf you are in Ubud, you definitely cannot skip the rice terraces and the bamboo\
  \ forest. There are many touristy spots for you to visit, however, I found myself\
  \ feeling more interested and connected by not visiting the most obvious places.\
  \ Having one week it's clearly not enough to explore everything that Bali has to\
  \ offer and I am hoping to come back again soon. But if you looking for a place\
  \ to evolve, connect, and find yourself, then Bali is the place for you. People\
  \ always tend to question why I travel so much, they might think I am trying to\
  \ find a escape out of my own reality - and sometimes it is. But the biggest reason\
  \ I travel, is not to forget to believe in the good in people. Traveling brings\
  \ people together and the belief that we can still believe in kindness.\n\nKindness.\
  \ That is the word I would describe Bali as. \n\nBali, you were so great to me and\
  \ I cannot be more grateful for the experience. I will see you soon!\n\nSafe travels,\n\
