Text: "LADAKH -  A TRAVELOGUE\n\nI was living in a compulsive state of existence,\
  \ when a glimpse at the clock had the power to steer me back to the right direction.\
  \ Ifelt the primal intelligence oozing out of me, one drop at a time.  \n      I\
  \ had spun worlds in  my mind, only to be free for a solitary moment in an ordinary\
  \ day. Such sinful moments of freedom ensure some pretty hopeless activities such\
  \ as skipping a meal or two, or sleeping past my prescribed time limit. So here\
  \ I am trying to pour several such moments within a couple of pages, all the while\
  \ keeping an eye on two young people I could see through the window, overlooking\
  \ my study-table,  the boy with stretched arms and legs drawn apart standing at\
  \ about an arm\u2019s distance from the girl, who, with unkempt  hair, passively\
  \ waiting for the boy to make a move. They have rolled down into a place where you\
  \ and I do not exist. Such are moments that you live for, when the world does not\
  \ exist as something separate from you, but as one that is a part of you. It is\
  \ a sudden slip from the tightrope. The pursuance  for such elusive moments of ecstasy\
  \ was the impetus behind planning a trip to Ladakh  which  made me fall so far away\
  \ from the tightrope I had been holding on to, that I cannot get back up. \n   \
  \      The Kushok Bakula Rimpochee Airport at Leh, Ladakh, welcomed us with a temperature\
  \ of about 10 degree celsius, a scorching sun and clear sky.  After having burdened\
  \ the car with our oversized bags full of heavy woollens, we, the \u201Cgreat Indian\
  \ family\u201D, consisting of four enthusiastic adults and myself, were driven through\
  \ the royal city of Leh, at a height of more than 11,000 feet. The landscape of\
  \ the city was a curious mixture of dusty terrains with sudden stretches of Poplar\
  \ trees along the banks of the Indus river flowing through the valley.\n       \
  \    Let me not give you any more inconsequential details, but jump a couple of\
  \ days ahead to the most thrilling journey of my life. The treacherous bends cropping\
  \ up at unpredictable moments, along with the thrill of encountering a group of\
  \ bikers all eager to cross Khardungla (at a height of  18360 feet  , it is now\
  \ the second highest motorable road in the world, having lost its position to the\
  \ recently commissioned Umlingla Pass, also in Ladakh) on their way to Nubra Valley\
  \ , was itself an escapade. It was also a moment of pity for the weary souls devoid\
  \ of  imagination, unable to embrace a moment outside their immediate experience.\
  \ After crossing Khardungla, we immersed ourselves into the beautiful stretch of\
  \ flat land along the Shyok river. As the river dodged out of sight, the landscape\
  \ reminded me of the foothills of the Andes.\n          \n          The next day\
  \ we reached Pangong. This place almost plays with your emotions,and leaves you\
  \ feeling insignificant. Like an abusive lover, it strips you naked, claws at your\
  \ vulnerabilities, finally turning its back at a moment of weakness. There is a\
  \ moment of realization as you are finally forced to walk away. It doesn\u2019t\
  \ care to call you back. A sense of loneliness invariably follows a betrayal. We\
  \ meekly made our way out of Pangong and back to Leh.The next day we boarded a flight\
  \ which took us back to Delhi. Sometimes a change is so abrupt that you suffer a\
  \ temporary dissociation from yourself. You can observe yourself from a distance,\
  \ as your body gets busy with the matter-of-factness of life. It is finally when\
  \ your corporeality is at rest , that the two dissociated selves are ready to merge\
  \ again and explode. It is perhaps  like this that the human soul reacts to change.\
  \ There is very little resistance. With every such change, you grow a bit older.\
  \ I think that is the way you age."
