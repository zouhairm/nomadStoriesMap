Text: "I was born and brought up in a typical World where people say everyone wants\
  \ something from you. A world where either they want to buy or to sell something\
  \ or another. It felt messed up and started this Quest to find if there is another\
  \ world out there with different mindsets.\nAnd you know what I found one, a world\
  \ of travel. I went all in with no expectations whatsoever. I was curious to see\
  \ what I will find and what I found was an abundance of Kindness. \nA world where\
  \ people will not just open their houses or kitchens for you but their hearts too\
  \ and they don't want anything in return. You can share your stories or laughs in\
  \ order to pay your gratitude and they will be more than happy to receive it. \n\
  One such story of unconditional kindness was getting created in the northeastern\
  \ mountains of India.on a very rainy. Two travelers from two very different countries\
  \ were on a Quest to see whole of Sikkim and meet all the warm humans and hug all\
  \ the dogs \U0001F644 that's what Travelers do. Soon this typical rainy day standing\
  \ under a makeshift shed in the middle of nowhere waiting for a vehicle to magically\
  \ appear so they can reach their destination of that day. As the time their host\
  \ from their last hitchhike was standing in his balcony and observing them. After\
  \ watching them for good 20 mins struggling to get another ride soaking up in rain\
  \ he decided to show his big heart and help them out. \nHe asked his wife to make\
  \ tea for the Traveller kids and he got all ready for a mission to feed the hungry\
  \ distress kids. With trays of tea ,biscuits and bun in his hand he too his wife\
  \ with an umbrella and approached the soaking travellers. Force feeding them on\
  \ roadside in pouring down rain. \nTravellers were shocked by this sudden flood\
  \ of kindness. They were not expecting a tea party in the middle of the road. Happily\
  \ shocked they try to fill as much as tea and biscuit they can in their mouth before\
  \ other ride comes and otherwise to have to leave this and run for it. \nWife which\
  \ was standing there quietly till now decided to wave to the vehicle passing to\
  \ fetch a ride for the stranger traveller kids his husband is so fond off. She wanted\
  \ to help \U0001F64F \nShe finally manage to stop a Car and talked them into taking\
  \ these kids along with them to their destination. \nOverwhelmed by this gesture\
  \ travellers bid their goodbyes with tears in eyes which was partially for the strangers\
  \ who fed them and partially from eating too much. Washing their tears in the rain\
  \ they moved to their destination.\nBut a story left behind, a story of act of kindness\
  \ on an unexpected day in an unexpected place. \nThat day changed something in them\
  \ , they found something they were expecting"
