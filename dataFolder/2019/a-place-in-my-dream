Text: "In many years passed by, way back in the Philippines, i used to see in my dream\
  \ a kind of place which i thought my first life was belong there. I used to see\
  \ the archaic building designs, the scenes and the feelings inside. I tried asking\
  \ myself if why i dreamed this unique place that made me curious about my first\
  \ life (believing that there's reincarnation in me). Maybe for God destined me to\
  \ leave my job in my home country and sought a job here in the UAE, this dream came\
  \ true. \n\nSo, way back August 2018, i and my friend from my old company decided\
  \ to travel in Armenia for fun and answer such curiosity because this place is the\
  \ mouth of most Filipinos who have fun for travel.  To make the story short, we\
  \ bought a plane ticket for back and forth and happily rode in the plane for lots\
  \ of questions in mind to how this Armenia made people interesting to travel.\n\n\
  Here it is, we paid the Visa good for 21 days of stay in Armenia and started to\
  \ mingle and socialize people within the airport vicinity. An excitement filled\
  \ with joy and curiosity prevailed. When we went out from the airport, we saw a\
  \ man held flash card with our names were written there. Oh, what a fantastic day\
  \ it was! He was an Armenia driver who sent us to the hotel where we booked. Along\
  \ the way, i saw a lot of archaic European building designs and the moment it flashed\
  \ and recalled in my mind the scene i saw in my peculiar dream. The land formations,\
  \ the vicinity of the city, perfect! I told to myself, how lucky i am, i went already\
  \ in this place for many times... My friend shared to me that, it is one way of\
  \ knowing that you're one to be a million of people around the world meant to visit\
  \ this place. So, i secretly contemplated and thanked to God for giving this opportunity.\n\
  \nThen we arrived in the hotel and started relaxing myself in great and spacious\
  \ VIP room. Early in the morning, we started the road to visit the 5 most famous\
  \ place in Armenia. The views in the oldest Monastery as well as the geographical\
  \ land forms and water forms in the country were all great and amazing. Foods are\
  \ so much tasty and palatable. Meeting a lot of people from different cultural background\
  \ was experienced within the four days of stay in Armenia. \n\nA fantastic ever\
  \ visit to a place in my typical dream!"
