Text: "So there I stood at the end of the world, trying to think of something profound.\
  \ I desperately tried to summon a Robert Frost poem that would make for a good fit.\
  \ Stopping by woods on a snowy evening? Something about promises to keep and miles\
  \ to go before I sleep? Nope, too cliched. Of course, nothing reflective came to\
  \ mind.\L\LAntarctica is such a hopeful, alluring, and mysterious place. It\u2019\
  s the only place on Earth where nations live together peacefully (on their respective\
  \ research stations) and get along, oftentimes inviting each other over for Christmas\
  \ dinners and costume parties. However clich\xE9d it may sound, there exists inexplicable\
  \ energy here unlike any other part of\_the world. It\u2019s hard to process emotions\
  \ and describe raw beauty in a place so pristine, pure and primal. The landscape\
  \ is Dali-esque,\_it melted my brain, much like Salvador\u2019s melting watches.\
  \ I didn\u2019t come across any life-altering epiphany but \u201Cperspective\u201D\
  \ earned an entirely new meaning.\n\nAs if the \"Drake Passage\" isn\u2019t terrifyingly\
  \ ominous-sounding enough, the adventure to the Antarctic begins long before you\
  \ even see an iceberg. A treacherous channel, connecting and separating the southernmost\
  \ tip of South America to the northernmost reaches of the Antarctic Peninsula, the\
  \ weather is often unpredictable but mostly brutal. These waters are known to be\
  \ the roughest in the world and waves can reach over 10m (33ft). An audition for\
  \ Monty Python\u2019s Ministry of Silly Walks, the sight for the first two days\
  \ to the peninsula is a steaming dish of comedy with a side of puke. Travel Tip:\
  \ \u201CDrake proof\u201D your cabin. This involves making sure everything is stowed\
  \ securely in your room. From personal experience, I highly recommend not leaving\
  \ batteries in your drawer- the incessant rolling back and forth can drive you into\
  \ a straight jacket.\L\LOne of the most exciting moments of the Drake crossing is\
  \ the sighting of your first iceberg. This signals the proximity of the White Continent\
  \ and you find yourself craving for more. You\u2019re hooked, and it feels good.\
  \ The first real taste of this bizarre alien planet, it takes a while to realize\
  \ that beneath your feet is 90% of all the world\u2019s ice and 70% of all the world\u2019\
  s fresh water. This is where your love affair with the land of snow and ice begins.\L\
  \LThat said, in a melancholic juxtaposition, I saw a huge tabular iceberg. Over\
  \ half a mile long and half a mile wide, it had broken off\_the Antarctic Larsen\
  \ B ice shelf, floating in the Antarctic ocean. Our in-house geologist explained\
  \ that much ice would be enough to make ice cubes for two gin and tonics for every\
  \ passenger on board (well over a 100)\u2014everyday for the next 30 years (or something\
  \ like that). While it\u2019s an interesting way to convey the message, it\u2019\
  s definitely terrifying.\n\nA theory states that the ancient Greeks assumed there\
  \ was a land down South since there was one up North. They had a strong concept\
  \ of symmetry and balance. So they named it Antartikos, meaning the opposite of\
  \ the Arctic. I think that\u2019s a pretty beautiful theory. Since it\u2019s so\
  \ unspoiled, it really feels like another planet- a combination of desolation and\
  \ silence. You\u2019re so detached from normal life when you\u2019re there, it\u2019\
  s wild.\n\nSo there I stood at the end of the world, trying to think of something\
  \ profound. It\u2019s very difficult to describe a trip of such epic proportions-\
  \ experiencing the world so far away changes the way you think. It\u2019s Pleistocene.\
  \ Only when you fall in love with a place, can you genuinely want it to stay protected\
  \ and unexploited.\L When you\u2019re at the end of the world, the rest of the world\
  \ stands still. Ordinary problems seem mundane. Untouched by time and humans (mostly),\
  \ this Terra Australis or \u201CSouthern Land\u201D is the harshest, most inhospitable,\
  \ driest, coldest, and windiest continent on Earth. It is also, however, the purest,\
  \ primal, peaceful and poignant. It\u2019s the only place on Earth that is how it\
  \ should be\u2014may it always remain that way.\n\nAnd with that, a haiku:\L \L\
  The deafening roar / Of Antarctica\u2019s silence / Makes a good haiku"
