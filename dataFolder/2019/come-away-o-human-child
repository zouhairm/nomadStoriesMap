Text: "I got lost in the fog when I was fifteen on Capri, Italy\u2019s fabled Isle\
  \ of Dreams. Since then, I\u2019ve been unsatisfied by the aphorism \u201Cnot all\
  \ who wander are lost.\u201D After Capri, I could reply to this cliche that not\
  \ all who are lost are afraid to be.\n\nWe\u2019d left the mainland by hovercraft\
  \ in dismal rain: a dozen pristine, precious Latin Club daughters and me, the thirteenth,\
  \ an unlucky changeling child who\u2019d work for two years to pay my affluent but\
  \ spiteful parents back for the trip. A creaking van drew us up the higher peaks\
  \ into thick fogs one precarious bend away at a time. Every curve I thought might\
  \ kill us drew me closer to the woman I\u2019d leave this island as.\n\nDeposited\
  \ outside a stark yellow perfumery like a stubborn lightship in the mist, the sound\
  \ of waves against concealed cliffs was somehow more immediate at this altitude.\
  \ It was the sound of gravity. While the girls perused perfumes malodorously interchangeable\
  \ with insect repellant, I saw that our teachers were not watching the door. Fog\
  \ had lured me from the toxic tension of my parent\u2019s house in Ontario many\
  \ times before, but half a planet away its irresistible opacity here above the clouds\
  \ was as powerful as a blackhole. I could no more remain indoors on this mysterious\
  \ island than a starving dog can resist a steak; that grey density beyond didn\u2019\
  t give me a choice.\n\nThe fiery perfumery flickered and faded as I was drawn away\
  \ into damp obscurity. Fog framed petite houses, cafes, and tourist kiosks along\
  \ a sloping cobblestone road from which I could see the outline of the island\u2019\
  s shape against the Mediterranean. Little paths branched from the road like elegant\
  \ arteries, alluring as sirens themselves since all escape routes led to the cliffs.\
  \ The inviting mouths of these paths promised to swallow me backwards out of civilization,\
  \ to steal me away from the control of a violent, loathing father.\n\n\u201CCome\
  \ away, O human child, to the waters and the wild,\u201D I murmured, slipping under\
  \ a dripping branch to follow one of these stone veins, long, narrow, and dense.\n\
  \nI smelled the edge of the cliff before it came into view beyond a crumbling brick\
  \ barrier worn by centuries. And looking out at the sea, it clicked: I\u2019d never\
  \ before had a real chance to escape my parents\u2019 brittle, brutal house shrouded\
  \ in its own demonic mists until this moment. \n\nWatching violent waters fling\
  \ foam against rock, I felt the vertigo of a jumper considering her plunge: could\
  \ I truly lose myself in this fog? I already had. But could I stay lost to the chaperones\
  \ I\u2019d come with? To the authorities? Even the Island of Dreams could be cracked\
  \ open, its subconscious secrets spread thin to find a lost child no matter how\
  \ unloved. The fog made me forget that but it also illuminated clearly, for the\
  \ first time, how powerful my desire to escape had burned for years.\n\nAfter an\
  \ hour, a flame cut through the fog behind me as two Italian grandmothers carrying\
  \ their own practical lanterns came along the narrow edge. Scolding, their ferociously\
  \ maternal suspicion drove me back from the edge with dry awareness that there was\
  \ only one way to truly be lost forever. It wasn\u2019t here in this fog, but against\
  \ those rocks to drift alongside naiads for eternity. \n\nI emerged to find the\
  \ road but wound myself more intricately into Capri\u2019s stone labyrinth. I was\
  \ only found hours later a teacher who called my parents that evening threatening\
  \ to send me home if I wandered off again. But I wasn\u2019t a child anymore after\
  \ looking down at those rocks, after seriously considering how I might survive if\
  \ I were to drift from the group again when we rode to infinitely busier Roma tomorrow.\
  \ \n\nI know now that losing oneself is never as simple as the fog makes it seem,\
  \ but having even a slim chance at escape wrought a metallurgical change in me.\
  \ My father believes he lost me when I ended all contact a decade later, but the\
  \ decision was made an ocean away when I first dreamt of freedom on Capri."
