Text: "After days in Myanmar, everything - emotions, sceneries and people \u2013 was\
  \ all overfilled yet I hardly found an adjective to say about it. There was something\
  \ that is very unique, very different from all what I have seen in other places,\
  \ things that cannot be named.\nIt was in a morning of gentle rains, when Nyaungshwe\
  \ town turned into deeply green under the rain. I walked to the boat jetty sharing\
  \ same umbrella with an old man. He was wearing a worn-out shirt and a longyi. Many\
  \ people looked at me and waved on the way. They may know that I was tourist and\
  \ I also waved back to them, put on the biggest smile I could have. Then the old\
  \ man said: Myanmar is poor, but we are always happy! I was suddenly frozen. Happiness\
  \ \u2013 that is the WORD. It is the one that I was looking for to describe this\
  \ country. From taxi drivers, horse cart coachmen, to girls selling stuff, hostel\
  \ owners or even room service staff. They always smile joyfully. Many questions\
  \ popped up in my head in that moment and they were all about Poverty and Happiness.\
  \ Could it be?\nWell, Why Not! IT COULD BE.\nI usually self-satirize that I have\
  \ enough \u2013 enough clothes, enough food. I may not be a rich guy, but I have\
  \ enough justification to call myself happy. That means Happiness is a concept that\
  \ follows material values. It sounds like a fact that would never change. Yet, in\
  \ that morning, on that reddy muddy road, a poor boatman who ferries tourists across\
  \ Inle lake enlightened me about the definition of happiness. There was nothing\
  \ of AQ spirit in what he said. Poverty and happiness seemed to be on two different\
  \ roads, not related to each other. It just meant that whether being poor or wealthy,\
  \ happiness is not the result of any previous action or state. Happy means happy,\
  \ that's it!\nMoney is important, of course. But in Myanmar, there is something\
  \ else that is more important. That is Happiness. Yes, people are not just all about\
  \ money. They always laugh happily. Over a week staying there, going to many places,\
  \ I never heard anyone pick a quarrel with someone else...\nI told my friend to\
  \ pay more money because she let us do early check-in and late checkout. I do not\
  \ want to presume on their kind nature. \"What's it?\", she asked. \u201CWe did\
  \ early check-in and late check-out. However, the point is we want to thank you\
  \ and the two girls for treating us so well\u201D, we explained. \n\u201CIf you\
  \ want to thank, recommend more guests for us. We would appreciate.\u201D and she\
  \ refused the money.\nThen I gave to the two girls. But they firmly disagreed to\
  \ receive too. And when they refused my money, their eyes were sparkling without\
  \ any hesitation. No matter who they are, they don\u2019t do anything to earn money.\
  \ I don\u2019t know why they do so to me, but between happiness and money, they\
  \ chose the former.\n\u201CI work here and get paid. Talking to you is fun. And\
  \ that is more important than money.\u201D Tiha told me. \u201CJust don\u2019t forget\
  \ us. Next time you visit, take my bike. No need to rent one.\u201D\nThe moment\
  \ we left, they all stood in front of the hostel to see our bus leaving Bagan. Before\
  \ turing, I still saw waving hands.\nEveryday in the mornings, noons, afternoons\
  \ or even late evenings before going to bed, I still heard people moaning, included\
  \ me, that \u201Clife is suffering\u201D. But, whenever I recall the magically tranquil\
  \ eyes and calm faces of people I met in Myanmar, I would like to be them, I would\
  \ choose to live the way they live. That is, to be equanimous facing matters. Every\
  \ person we met would teach us good lesson. But this is the first time when I was\
  \ taught that Happiness has nothing to do with Poverty or Wealth. I still can see\
  \ kind peaceful smiles and happy faces of those rough-looking people whenever I\
  \ think of those wandering days in that magic land. Myanmar, land of happiness,\
  \ the place where everybody has happiness in their gene\u2026"
