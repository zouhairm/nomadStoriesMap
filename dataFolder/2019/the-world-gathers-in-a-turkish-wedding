Text: "In many countries, you have to be a rebel to crash a wedding party. I have\
  \ only done it once - it was in Turkey, where this seems to be a normal and authentic\
  \ thing to do. The bride and groom are happy to see strangers joining them at the\
  \ dance floor.\nIt was a Saturday of summer and in the hotel where I was staying,\
  \ on the banks of the Karadeniz -the Black Sea, which is actually green- began a\
  \ fake and traditional Turkish wedding. Khadija, my tutor, had organized the event\
  \ and bombarded us with information about parties, henna night, traditions, the\
  \ old stuff and the new.\nI was wearing a red and gold Ottoman style suit and a\
  \ piece of tulle covered half of my hair. The musicians played instruments of many\
  \ strings and the rattle of the drums marked the rhythm of that mystical habit.\n\
  I had traveled alone to the city of Samsun to study for a few weeks. It was with\
  \ my seventeen classmates with whom I shared a dance in this ceremony. One, two.\
  \ Step forward, step back. The sea wind blew out the candles that I must have had\
  \ lit in my hands. I looked around worried because I did not want to ruin the dance.\
  \ But the same thing had happened to the pair of Latin girls, to the Kenyana, to\
  \ the Asians and the Italians. We looked at each other and I think we all found\
  \ ourselves in the same situation and felt as equal and united as ever... we followed\
  \ the dance in the middle of that connection.\nTo complete the marriage, it is imperative\
  \ for the bride to cry. This shows that she feels bad for leaving home and moving\
  \ into the unknown. Accompanying the supposed future groom were my men classmates,\
  \ dressed in suits.\nThe bride received gold coins from the hand of her mother-in-law;\
  \ the groom approaches her. Then they held hands and shared a dance. We were all\
  \ very connected with the ceremony and that is why Khadija clapped his hands all\
  \ along.\nI felt the wedding had ended too fast, almost as much as the trip - it\
  \ was the last day. It had been a very typical experience\u2026 But in Turkey traditional\
  \ and modern coexist, and this is special in Samsun for being the city where the\
  \ campaign that turned the Ottoman Empire into a democracy began.\nWe were listening\
  \ to music nearby. We followed its sound and there was a wedding: a real one. I\
  \ had already heard that to crash a wedding was also something \"traditional\" in\
  \ the city. We started dancing, one step, two steps... Someone in the family took\
  \ my hand to make a dancing circle. \"Tamam, tamam\" he would repeat, to indicate\
  \ me that everything was ok. Khadija, excited for our interest, helped us understood\
  \ this dance. Suddenly, we were fifteen dancers in the middle of someone else's\
  \ wedding.\nThe couple was happy with this \u201Cforeigner\u201D show. Samsun is\
  \ not in the traditional tourist routes. Almost nobody speaks English in the city,\
  \ nevertheless we managed to convince the DJ to play some \"western\" songs. After\
  \ that we learned the steps of the Turkish summer hits.\nThey handed out balloons\
  \ with the Turkish flag - a flag that is hung in practically every house in the\
  \ country. I danced with the balloon while discovering that the decoration was light\
  \ blue and white, like the colors of my Argentina. I felt at home not because of\
  \ the colors, but because I discovered myself exploring the Turkish life through\
  \ the eyes of my 23 companions \u2013 23 young students from remote parts of the\
  \ world, all of them so different and so alike at the same time, everyone with a\
  \ thousand and one questions to ask each other.\nSamsun is said to be halfway between\
  \ Europe and the Middle East. It was right there, dancing with my new friends and\
  \ with the just married couple, listening to the Erik Dal\u0131 song, drinking \xE7\
  ay (tea) when I felt my connection with Turkey. Right there in the \"halfway\" I\
  \ found that something I had been dreaming of: the world dancing together in Samsun."
