Text: "FIVE REASONS WHY YOU MUST NEVER GO TO THAILAND\n\nTagged as the Land of Smiles\
  \ is the Asia\u2019s top-billed tourist destination \u2013 Thailand. Home of the\
  \ luxurious royal palaces, wondrous beaches, olden ruins and rich temples of Buddha,\
  \ Thailand is considered one of the most beautiful countries in Asia. But why do\
  \ you think you must never try to travel in Thailand? Here are the primary reasons\
  \ why:\n\n1. One-of-a-kind places? You must NEVER travel to Thailand if you do NOT\
  \ want to see picturesque landscape and seascape. If you do NOT want to pamper yourself\
  \ on white beaches, cityscapes, unique-themed coffee and food shops, distinctive\
  \ architectural buildings and interiors, ancient ruins and island hopping, you must\
  \ NEVER go here. Thailand houses many translucent white sand island beaches like\
  \ in Phuket, Koh Fifi, Koh Larn, Koh Samed, Koh Chang in North, East or South part\
  \ of it. It also houses numerous animal tourist destinations which you could enjoy\
  \ playing with elephants, tigers and monkeys.\n\n2. On a budget trip? Travelling\
  \ is fun. You will get to see the beauty of the world first-hand. But how expensive\
  \ is it to explore? In Thailand, if you do NOT want to purchase tour trips that\
  \ only cost $5-$30, then do NOT go here. If you do NOT want to stay in a conducive\
  \ and luxurious hotel rooms for only less than a hundred dollars, then do NOT book\
  \ here. Many products and services in Thailand cost very cheap. If you do NOT want\
  \ to travel more and will only spend less, then do NOT go here. Sounds a heads up,\
  \ right?\n\n3. Food trip anyone? Do you mind eating on the streets? Can you indulge\
  \ in indigenous and authentic Thai street food? Most Asian countries specifically\
  \ Southeast Asian countries have various indigenous food to offer that can only\
  \ be eaten from their place. If you do NOT want to try eating cockroaches, scorpions,\
  \ bugs and worms, then do NOT try to go to Thailand. If you can NOT tolerate spicy\
  \ food, then Thailand is NOT your place. Thais mostly enjoy spicy food and raw dishes.\
  \ If you do NOT want to experience eating those in a cheap price, then Thailand\
  \ is NOT your place.\n\n4. Deep Culture? If you do NOT want to experience deep Buddhism\
  \ culture, then do NOT go here. If you do NOT want to see pride, nationalism and\
  \ patriotism too deeply, then Thailand is NOT the place to visit. Thais have a deep\
  \ respect to their culture and their country especially to their Royal Family. Most\
  \ places have images and emblems of Buddha and their Royal Family which are very\
  \ sacred and respected in their culture. If you do NOT follow the rules, you know\
  \ where you will end. If you do NOT want to experience culture-oriented yet a twist\
  \ of modernization, then Thailand is NOT the place. \n\n5. English-Speaking People?\
  \ If you do NOT want to challenge yourself in speaking different languages, then\
  \ Thailand is NOT the option. Most Thais cannot speak English but it does not mean\
  \ they are poor and stupid. Since their culture is too respected, they want to uplift\
  \ their sense of nationalism by priding their language into the world. If you are\
  \ lazy enough to atleast try to learn their language, then you know what to do,\
  \ NEVER go here. Aside from that, if you do NOT want to be indulged with Thai hospitality,\
  \ helpfulness and generosity, Thailand is NOT the place. Thais, basically, are warm-hearted\
  \ and kind to their fellow Thais as well as to foreigners. They are aware that their\
  \ country is visited mostly from other Asian and Western countries. So they are\
  \ equipped with smile and helping hand to their friends from other countries. Being\
  \ in Thailand for almost two years, I have experienced so many happy and overwhelming\
  \ experiences. I really appreciate their love for their culture and their sense\
  \ of nationalism. Their enchanting places and delicious food are, by far, my most\
  \ happy travel memories. As my second home, aside from the Philippines, I am deeply\
  \ in love with their country in all terms. Thailand is my second home, my second\
  \ love."
