Text: "I\u2019ve always been fascinated by the ways different cultures choose to honour\
  \ their dead (in an entirely non-macabre way). While travelling in Havana, Cuba,\
  \ when I heard there was a miniature city (140 acres) of crypts, vaults, gravestones,\
  \ memorials and about 500 mausoleums (some dating back to the 1800s), I had to go.\
  \ I took the bus to the Cementerio de Col\xF3n, or \u2018Colon Cemetery\u2019 in\
  \ English. That, however, is not the organ I associate it with.\n\L\nI wandered\
  \ in through the huge gate and down the main pathway. Domes and pyramids, ornate\
  \ mausoleums of all shapes and varieties lined the road that led to the chapel in\
  \ the centre. Life-size statues of angels adorned family crypts. Some of the memorials\
  \ were immaculately maintained while others lay neglected, derelict and decaying,\
  \ like much of Havana.\_\n\L\nAs I was walking a quiet side road, I felt the gaze\
  \ of a man a short distance away. I turned to look. He was looking at me. At first,\
  \ I assumed he was a worker but I quickly realised that he was not working, he was\
  \ playing \u2026with himself.\_\n\L\nYes, there in the middle of an otherwise beautiful\
  \ Tuesday afternoon in what was definitely the most impressive cemetery I had ever\
  \ seen, was some sicko with his penis on display. Well, that\u2019s one way to honour\
  \ the dead!\n\L\nMy first thought was: \u201CMaybe it\u2019s not a penis? Maybe\
  \ if I take a deep breath maybe I will realise that it\u2019s something else altogether?\u201D\
  \ My next thought was: \u201CMaybe if it\_is\_a penis maybe he thought he was alone,\
  \ and now that he realises I\u2019m here, maybe he\u2019ll put it back and pretend\
  \ nothing happened?\u201D (The word \u201Cmaybe\u201D seems to run through my head\
  \ a lot in uncomfortable situations.) The thoughts continued: \u201CMaybe when he\
  \ realises that I saw him he will die from embarrassment and then his friends can\
  \ come, pull up his pants, and roll him into the nearest open grave?\u201D I then\
  \ reached my conclusion: \u201CMaybe I should have gone to El Capitolio instead?\u201D\
  \n\L\nI glanced back. It was a penis. It was still out. He definitely wasn\u2019\
  t urinating through it.\_\n\L\nWhen you\u2019re a female relatively alone in a 140-acre\
  \ cemetery in close proximity to a man of questionable mental health displaying\
  \ an erect penis, it\u2019s probably in your best interests to seek the attention\
  \ of other sane people. So, I walked quickly in the direction of the chapel. Inside,\
  \ there was a family grieving in more conventional ways. I didn\u2019t want to disturb\
  \ them. I was disturbed enough for everybody.\n\L\nOutside I found a security guard.\
  \ I told him that a man had exposed himself to me. He responded in Spanish something\
  \ to the effect that there was more to see in the other direction. I didn\u2019\
  t want to see anything else. I had already seen too much! I explained again through\
  \ the digital miracle of google translate. His response the second time was probably\
  \ greater than mine was to the actual event! He walked me to the security office\
  \ where I explained again. About a minute later the police arrived. They asked me\
  \ if I would please go with them around the cemetery to see if I could spot the\
  \ guy. I climbed into their little old retro car with no air-conditioning for the\
  \ second part of my excursion.\n\L\nI got the feeling that if we found the man,\
  \ he was going to be in a lot of trouble. I had heard that beef is so scarce in\
  \ Cuba it is reserved only for tourists and if someone is caught selling it to locals\
  \ they can go to jail. If that\u2019s how much trouble you can get into for selling\
  \ beef, what about displaying sausage?\n\L\nWe didn\u2019t find the man.\_\n\L\n\
  There were a lot of pictures I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t get to take (and some\
  \ I\u2019m okay with). There were a number of mausoleums I would like to have had\
  \ a closer look at (and other things I\u2019m glad I only saw from a distance).\
  \ At the end of the day, I still love Havana and I\u2019m not about to let one dick\
  \ spoil that!"
