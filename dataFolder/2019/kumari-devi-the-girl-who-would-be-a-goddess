Text: "\u201C That\u2019s not part of the tour \u201C said the wiry, grinning guide\
  \ flashing his gleaming white teeth and projecting the reassuring but quiet confidence\
  \ of a boy child who has run up and down the treacherous Himalayan ranges since\
  \ he could stand. This man had given us the introductory welcome speech the night\
  \ before as we were about to embark on our trek to Base Camp in a few days. Our\
  \ itinerary commenced with a day tour of Kathmandu. Feeling surreal, standing in\
  \ the middle of a freshly formed tour group in Durbar Square a sign caught my eye.\
  \ I promptly burst into tears. \n\nThe sun bore down on the back on my newly purchased\
  \ sweat wicking t-shirt, signalling me out as a tourist, one of the thousands that\
  \ come every year to pay homage to Everest, Chamonlungma .The newly formed group\
  \ stood awkwardly trying not to make eye contact with me.  I pointed to the sign\
  \ softly saying, \u201CI know this place although I\u2019ve never been.\u201D This\
  \ was the culmination of a life time of dreaming about trekking the Himalayas and\
  \ the obstacles and turns that had previously prevented this. This was day one after\
  \ a head rush that had led me and an acquaintance to grab hold of an opportunity,\
  \ purchased with trepidation committing ourselves to something we had briefly chatted\
  \ about and sealed with a handshake of,\u201D No regrets\u201D and a fair bit of\
  \ watching every Nat Geo documentary showing Nepal.\n\nAs the heat shimmered off\
  \ the red stones in the small courtyard set to the side of the Square we side stepped\
  \ to catch bits of shade. I burst into a rapid fire explanation, trying to convey\
  \ the tradition of the Kumari Devi or Living Goddess before we had to move on. I\
  \ spun on my heel towards the hand painted, faded wooden sign. The group couldn\u2019\
  t help but listen as I explained the Legend of the Kumari as described by Wikipedia\
  \ as a,\u201D Prepubescent girl selected from the Shakaya caste or Baijacharya clan\
  \ of the Nepalese Newari Community.\u201D A female toddler is chosen, taken from\
  \ their family around age three to live a life of isolation, waited on by minders\
  \ and worshipped by many. The young woman is released from her gilded captivity\
  \ at puberty and returned to her family. The door beckoned. \n\nAs a mother and\
  \ a social worker working with disadvantaged children living in complex situations\
  \ in Australia, I have been torn between the imagined experience of the child Kumari\
  \ and what I imagine her alternative life could have been in a poverty stricken\
  \ country. I was slightly relieved to learn the chosen girl is now permitted to\
  \ obtain an education. Standing there I knew I need to go and make an offering at\
  \ her feet and honour a culture that was alien but strangely hypnotic to me. By\
  \ now the other members of the group, who would grow into a tight knit bunch as\
  \ we trudged up the Mountain later in the week, were also intrigued by this tale\
  \ and unanimously decided they wanted to see her too.\n\nI paid my small entry fee\
  \ in rupiah and waited until one of her minders\u2019 beckoned us into the small\
  \ rendered room which smelt of incense. The blank but regal stare of the heavily\
  \ made up, costumed child on her wooden throne was both confronting, humbling and\
  \ slightly formidable. As instructed, I knelt at her feet and bowed. It was over\
  \ in a flash.\n\nFive years later I regularly think of how her life is turning out.\
  \ I recently read a new Kumari was crowned and the child Goddess whose feet I bowed\
  \ at  was whisked out of the side door at the age of thirteen, no longer a Goddess.\
  \ She has been  reunited with her family and trying to integrate into the world\
  \ .I read she is struggling with this. A new cycle has commenced with a three year\
  \ old child, whose twin brother reportedly cried as his sister was taken from her\
  \ family. A week later we made it to Base Camp, but it was the journey not the end\
  \ that stuck with me."
