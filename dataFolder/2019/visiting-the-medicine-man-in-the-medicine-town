Text: "The medicine man\u2019s family compound, a collection of crumbling stone-carved\
  \ structures, is twenty minutes outside the jungle town of Ubud, Bali. The morning\
  \ air is already heavy and thick with incense, with rooster song. \n\n\u201CHe\u2019\
  ll poke your feet with a stick, or something\u2014the healer,\u201D was all I\u2019\
  d been told before folding myself into the stuffy van that morning.\n\nOn the open-air\
  \ temple dais in the center of the compound, I sit cross-legged with a dozen other\
  \ sarong-wearing Westerners. We\u2019re each holding a palm-size banana-leaf-basket\
  \ offering, three crisp pink rupiah bills slipped between plumeria blossoms\u2014\
  the medicine man\u2019s fee.\n\nI arrived in Ubud, Bali, the month before, an almost\
  \ accidental side trip after a grad school diploma that left stress and weariness\
  \ thick on me like mud. After a rent increase in Seattle, I put my things in storage\
  \ and bought a plane ticket to Fiji to visit a friend. A week before my flight,\
  \ another friend suggested: \u201CYou should check out Bali while you\u2019re over\
  \ there. It\u2019s not too far.\u201D\n\nI found myself googling Bali the next day,\
  \ centering in on Ubud, a place full of digital nomads who work on laptops between\
  \ yoga classes and scooter trips to the beach. A town whose name comes from the\
  \ Balinese word \u201Cubad,\u201D or \u201Cmedicine.\u201D\n\nI bought a one-way\
  \ flight.\n\nThe healer arrives and instructs the first woman to sit on the floor\
  \ with her back against his shins. Then, crablike, his fingers start roaming over\
  \ her skull, cresting her forehead, tapping the pressure points on her temples,\
  \ sinuses, jaw, pressing along her arms as if looking for buttons.\n\n\u201CYou\
  \ are anxious,\u201D he announces, and she nods.\n\nThe medicine man asks the woman\
  \ to lie down on the bamboo mat beside his chair. He crouches his thin, deeply wrinkled\
  \ body beside her feet, pulling out a long but delicately carved stick and starts\
  \ prodding her, methodically, between her toes.\n\n\u201CStomach, liver, pancreas,\
  \ mind, lungs, heart,\u201D he lists as he jabs, her body occasionally going rigid\
  \ with pain. He pauses to look up at her face, pushes a little harder as she writhes.\n\
  \n\u201CThis is your pancreas,\u201D he says. \u201CYou must eat less sugar.\u201D\
  \ He recommends omega-3 to balance her hormones. Tells her to drink less. When he\
  \ presses beside her little toe, and she remains at ease, he says, \u201CLungs,\
  \ good.\u201D Press. \u201CHeart, good.\u201D\n\nHe stands then, suddenly powerful\
  \ at her feet, and moves his arms\_in wide circles toward her body, as if transferring\
  \ his energy to her, speaking in soft Balinese. Healing her.\n\nEveryone is silent\
  \ without being told.\_\n\nHe kneels again as the woman comes up on her elbows,\
  \ smiling contagiously, the memory of pain now far away. He pokes between her toes\
  \ again, and she laughs, her body completely relaxed.\n\n\u201CWhy are you here?\u201D\
  \ the medicine man asks me after I deposit my offering among the growing pile and\
  \ say good morning in Indonesian: \u201CSelamat pagi.\u201D\n\n\u201CBalance,\u201D\
  \ I say. \u201CJoy,\u201D I suggest. I shrug, unsure.\n\n\u201CSit,\u201D he says.\
  \ He brushes my hair to the side, and I close my eyes, waiting for the pain.\n\n\
  His fingers skim over my face, my jaw, my scalp, his hands pausing on my shoulders.\
  \ \u201CWhat do you need healed?\u201D\n\nI think to say: stress, bad sleep, bad\
  \ habits, listlessness. But all those familiar ailments\u2014so omnipresent when\
  \ I was in grad school they became part of how I self-identified\u2014have faded\
  \ away since I arrived in Ubud.\n\nHere, I am open, social, curious, calm. I go\
  \ to yoga, art classes, temples, eat well, sleep deeply, drive a scooter through\
  \ jungle roads, write poolside, wander streets slowly, always say yes to new friends\
  \ and adventures.\n\nUbud itself, it seemed, had already given me my medication.\
  \ \n\n\u201CI don\u2019t know, anymore,\u201D I say.\n\n\u201CMy fingers aren\u2019\
  t picking anything up,\u201D he says. He indicates for me to lie down and then pokes\
  \ between my toes halfheartedly. \u201CYour body is healthy,\u201D he says. \u201C\
  Your mind is healthy.\u201D\n\nHe smiles at me mischievously then, his crumpled\
  \ leather face lighting up the way an old man\u2019s expression can take on that\
  \ of a boy\u2019s, and he says: \u201CLove. You find love, and it will all be even\
  \ better.\u201D"
