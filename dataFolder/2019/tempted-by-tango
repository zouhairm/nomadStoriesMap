Text: "Tango dancing has been a big part of Buenos Aires\u2019 local culture ever\
  \ since the 1880s, brought over by immigrants to the port area of R\xEDo de Plata.\
  \ A few days after landing in Buenos Aires and exploring its many charms, I ventured\
  \ out to the colourful and picturesque La Boca neighbourhood, renowned for its tango,\
  \ football and political graffiti art. \n\nHopping off the local bus to join a walking\
  \ tour, we wandered around the \u2018Disneyland\u2019 streets, its houses splashed\
  \ with panels of primary colours. We listened to an engaging account of the vibrant\
  \ yet turbulent history of the area and its influence on Argentine culture. The\
  \ graffiti art tells many stories, not just of tango but of the 30,000 \u201Cdisappeared\u201D\
  \ people, lost to the military dictatorship of the 1970s and 1980s. \n\nAfter the\
  \ tour we went to El Gran Paraiso, to try a famous \u2018asado\u2019, barbeque.\
  \ We ordered one traditional asado (points for cultural etiquette) and one that\
  \ clearly confirmed our status as tourists - the vegetarian option. Next time you\u2019\
  re feeling playful, try ordering a vegetarian asado in Argentina. The facial expression\
  \ that you will be met with is rather memorable.\n\nIt was as we exited the touristy\
  \ area and strayed to the residential area where we had been warned against (due\
  \ to the risk of pick-pocketing) that I saw my first authentic dancing scene. My\
  \ gaze followed the sound of catchy Latino music across the road where an old school\
  \ stereo was placed on the footpath. Standing next to it were a couple of guys cooking\
  \ meat over a charcoal parrilla, an elderly \u2018abuela\u2019 grandmother sitting\
  \ in a deckchair watching over two kids, aged no more than three or four. The kids\
  \ were mesmerizing, letting it rip with their local dance moves. The rest of the\
  \ world melted away as they grooved to the music with exceptional rhythm pulsing\
  \ through their Latino blood. \n\nInspired as I arrived back at my hostel in Palermo,\
  \ I managed in broken Spanish to convince my new dorm friend to come to a tango\
  \ lesson with me at the local joint. Uruguayan through and through, she had grown\
  \ up listening to tango music, thanks to her grandma. \n\nWaving goodbye to our\
  \ chatty, toothless Uber driver, we ventured through the open door and up the wooden\
  \ stairs to La Catedral del Tango. Upstairs was a room packed with young people,\
  \ sitting and standing in a circle, watching an older man dancing tango with a young\
  \ girl. Older masters partnered with younger apprentices is common nowadays, with\
  \ tango regaining popularity amongst Argentine and Uruguayan youth after a few decades.\n\
  Grabbing a beer and an empanada, we joined the edge of the circle, watching the\
  \ enthralling dancers gliding, twisting, turning, bending. They finished as the\
  \ music changed, and the crowd dispersed. \n\nWe made our way into a larger room\
  \ where the dance classes are held. High ceilings, walls draped with artwork, and\
  \ dim lighting decorated the enchanting hippy style room. We were soon joined by\
  \ what turned out to be a young Danish football team, and several jugs of beer.\
  \ This was the last demographic of people I expected to find at a tango class in\
  \ Buenos Aires. Clearly its charm extends to all sorts! \n\nThe lesson started hilariously\
  \ with a warm-up of sweeping movements, followed by basic tango steps, then instructions\
  \ to partner up. Females were told to close their eyes and \u2018feel\u2019 the\
  \ music, letting the male partner lead. Another unexpected element to the night.\
  \ Despite my enthusiasm to get in amongst the local culture, I lack any trace of\
  \ Latin rhythm in my blood- quite the opposite to the kids of La Boca. \n\nIt turns\
  \ out that closing your eyes, letting yourself move to the music and be led by damp\
  \ hands, is a rather enjoyable experience. The youngest looking of the 21-year-old\
  \ football players was by far the best dancer, and as we glided across the room,\
  \ my eyes closed, I allowed myself to pretend to be that elderly \u2018abuela\u2019\
  \ from La Boca in her younger days."
