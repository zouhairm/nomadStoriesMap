Text: "From the moment I could barely crawl I knew I wanted to adventure, discover,\
  \ look and find anything I had never seen before. That was no different when I was\
  \ 16 and my first plane ride was to China. I fell in love with travel and it was\
  \ a love I wanted to share with anyone who would listen and venture with me into\
  \ the unknown. So Vietnam, my latest pursuit was no different but perhaps even more\
  \ enriching because it was sharing a deep love with the person I love - my boyfriend\
  \ Chris. \n\nChris is also curious minded and passionate about conquering new ground,\
  \ but until recently only within Australia's borders. He was the first to traverse\
  \ the Murray River in Australia, by kayak to its origin Mount Kosciusko. Of course\
  \ meeting a professional Adventurer I felt it was my duty to seduce him into the\
  \ world of overseas travel. What we both could not expect was how we were going\
  \ to fall head over heels for Vietnam!\n\nThe first glance into the country seems\
  \ as chaotic as it may have felt back in it's era of war times - traffic zooming\
  \ around streets like stampedes of antelope. It's a threatening thought just to\
  \ think of trying to cross the street. But to us it was no less than learning to\
  \ walk again only differently. When we did get across and into the depths of this\
  \ humid, foreign land we found warmth that wasn't just from the sun. \n\nAway from\
  \ the crowds of deck chair laden beaches and curtains of lanterns in the streets\
  \ of Old Town Hoi An we came across a truely exquisite gem. We chuffed along a back\
  \ street outside of the tourist centres and drove on our scooter among the houses\
  \ of the Vietnamese. There was no rush here. No queues of traffic to get to a shopping\
  \ centre. No banners of advertising, plastering a sidewalk. There was gardens of\
  \ overgrown fields and tended gardens. There was bright colours of tropical flowers\
  \ gazing at us flying past and there was the front door of a Vietnamese house we\
  \ had to stop at. It was a small verandah that had been set up with tables and chairs.\
  \ Set with table cloths flapping in the breeze and an elderly couple who welcomed\
  \ us in. They were humble and yet an example Chris and I could already look up to.\
  \ Not in terms of height - but the love they seemed to have shared for years. We\
  \ were welcomed in and seated and given a menu. \n\nWe thought we might have found\
  \ a couple items but instead pages of what seemed home made, authentic cuisine they\
  \ made most likely for their own family too. The man helped us pronounce each dish\
  \ we ordered and sitting back in the ocean breeze we couldn't help but notice the\
  \ love and attention they gave to their home despite their humble means. Exotic\
  \ smells filled our lungs as each dish came out. Mango nectar, charred smoky beef\
  \ and refreshing, herbal mint just to name a few. \n\nWithout any English this Vietnamese\
  \ couple's love was expressed through their food, cooking and service to us despite\
  \ being complete strangers to them. It really gave us a sense of the meaning of\
  \ love in it's essence - kindness no matter what background, language, culture,\
  \ religion, colour or appearance. It was an experience and gift we felt money was\
  \ never truly going to deliver the gratitude and love we felt. We gave what we could\
  \ and I felt a tug inside as Chris gave the man a hug and bid him farewell in short\
  \ amount of Vietnamese we could muster. \n\nAdventure and travel can find you feeling\
  \ every emotion any human can experience but there are experiences that reach the\
  \ peak of all of those. An emotion of love that you can find in the person you feel\
  \ most close to but also from a stranger from the other side of the world. This\
  \ is truly why those who roam do not just like to travel, they fall in love with\
  \ travel."
