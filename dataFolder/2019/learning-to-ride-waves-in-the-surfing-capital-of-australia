Text: "Days fresh in Australia, I sat at Bondi Beach, mesmerized. Watching surfers\
  \ is secondhand surfing for me. The moment they catch a wave I too feel the weightlessness.\
  \ And the look. I love the sleekness of ankle to wrist form-fitting black. Or, even\
  \ better, guys with their wetsuits half off, abs exposed, arms of their wetsuits\
  \ hanging. \u201COh yes,\u201D I thought, eyeing the Australian eye candy, \u201C\
  I can get on board with everything here.\u201D \n\nI moved to Torquay, known as\
  \ the Surfing Capital of Australia, where I went to the beach almost daily but only\
  \ swam or sunbathed. Mainly I watched surfers with envy and admiration. When I did\
  \ go in, the water was too cold, the waves too big, the ocean so powerful it would\
  \ inevitably pull down my bikini top. It doesn\u2019t take much gear to surf, but\
  \ still, I needed some gear: a wetsuit and a board. And preferably basic instruction.\
  \ \n\nI signed up for a class at a local surf school. In the days before, I prepped\
  \ by watching YouTube tutorials, doing pushups, and asking my housemates, Australian\
  \ and lifelong surfers, important questions: Can I pee in the wetsuit? Even in a\
  \ rental? How many people have peed in a rental wetsuit? \n\nMy surfing instructors\
  \ were two charming Aussies whom I did not have a crush on at all. After our group\
  \ was fitted for wetsuits, we carried our boards to the beach, practiced the techniques\
  \ of paddling and \u201Cpopping up\u201D on the sand, and got in the water. My wetsuit\
  \ smelled like the YMCA pool of my childhood, but it was a game changer. I wasn\u2019\
  t cold, it didn\u2019t fall off, and I wasn\u2019t grossed out when seaweed clumps\
  \ brushed against me. I felt invincible. \n\nThe instructors said the goal of that\
  \ day was not to stand up. Somehow standing up equates \u201Csuccess,\u201D but\
  \ many people don\u2019t stand up their first (or second, or third) time surfing.\
  \ The goal was to catch a wave and have fun. I caught many waves, feeling that rush\
  \ I had been anticipating, and was told I was having too much fun. I needed to get\
  \ my own wetsuit. \n\nConveniently, a nearby surf outlet was having a sale. Thirty\
  \ minutes later, I was huddled in a warehouse corner, rolling tubes of neoprene\
  \ over my pale, squishy thighs, still clad in shorts, trying to be discreet (Anyone\
  \ who has done the \u201Cpants dance\u201D to squeeze into jeans needs to experience\
  \ the \u201Cwetsuit dance\u201D for a new level of appreciation). \n\nI had my wetsuit,\
  \ my housemates had a garage full of surfboards in various states of disrepair for\
  \ the borrowing, and my sole surf class gave me the confidence to get started. I\
  \ just needed practice.  \n\nSurfing world champion Layne Beachley said surfing\
  \ is like dancing on the ocean. For me, surfing is like dancing only in that the\
  \ learning process instigates harsh self-criticism, social anxiety, and a lot of\
  \ falling. The Australian National Surfing Museum has a section where ClipArt-esque\
  \ images illustrate ways to wipe out. Highlights include The Barrel, where you\u2019\
  re rolled for periods of time that test lung capacity, The Tombstone, where you\u2019\
  re so far underwater that your board is left bobbing vertically at the surface,\
  \ and The Nosedive, self explanatory and apparently my preferred method. \n\nSometimes,\
  \ after I feel like I\u2019ve been thrown through an automated car wash, I wonder\
  \ why I do this to myself. I find scrapes on my feet and bruises on my butt that\
  \ I have no recollection of acquiring. How does falling on water bruise? \n\nThe\
  \ main thing I\u2019ve learned from surfing is how much I don\u2019t know. I\u2019\
  ve met surfers who read the waves like a map, who namedrop all the surf legends\
  \ and shoptalk your ear off, and who carve their own boards with the precision of\
  \ a luthier. \n\nI have a newfound respect for the power of the ocean and the skill\
  \ of those who navigate it. It\u2019s a world I know so little about, but even as\
  \ a beginner, it\u2019s possible to sneak small moments. When I catch a wave just\
  \ right, skimming along the whitewater, I find this lightness and know it\u2019\
  s what I\u2019ve been searching for."
