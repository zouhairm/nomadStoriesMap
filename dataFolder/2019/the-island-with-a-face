Text: "A cacophony of roosters herald the day in Gregory Town, Eleuthera, as they\
  \ call out from yard to yard like squabbling neighbours. The early morning ambience\
  \ is complete with a whistling kettle and the smell of grits while 65 year old Eleutheran,\
  \ Carlie Barrie, pats about the kitchen. The spirit and vivacity of the Bahamian\
  \ island, it\u2019s name meaning \u201Cfree\u201D, was wholly embodied by Carlie\
  \ who opened up her self-built home and showed me every inch of life in Eleuthera.\
  \ It was a breath of fresh air from the flashy, all-inclusive grandeur of the mainland\
  \ Nassau, to be bobbing about in her old red truck on lengthy tree-lined roads distressed\
  \ with potholes. It was in this truck that I was driven the entire 110 mile length\
  \ of the island and bore witness to its endless cultural soul, all the while with\
  \ Carlie stopping without failure to pick up any single piece of rubbish littering\
  \ the roads which she threw in the back of her truck for later disposal. After a\
  \ few days of steep climbing, deep swimming and me trying to keep up, we were destined\
  \ for the far end of the island. On this southern-most tip of Eleuthera, where the\
  \ Caribbean Sea meets the Atlantic Ocean in a magnificent collision of turquoise\
  \ and sapphire, there is an untouched acreage of land cradling an immaculate shoreline\
  \ that is Lighthouse Beach. Thirty-three days in the Bahamas and of all the technicolour\
  \ and masquerade of the place, I found this beach the most authentically stunning.\
  \ Besides the fact that Lighthouse Beach has long been pinned as one of the most\
  \ magnificent sites in the Bahamas, I had another calling to visit. Since I landed\
  \ on the mainland, there had been chattering among locals of the multi-million dollar\
  \ deal Disney had just closed to purchase the land with the intention of building\
  \ another cruise ship port. This sparked my attention and I had to witness the apparent\
  \ slice of heaven that Lighthouse Beach was before it was to fall victim to the\
  \ mass commercial style of tourism that already plagues so much of the Bahamas.\
  \ The key opposition campaigning against such development on Lighthouse Beach was\
  \ the local non-for-profit organisation, the One Eleuthera Foundation, who formed\
  \ under a vision for the sustainable development of Eleuthera and its local inhabitants.\
  \ When we reached out to the organisation their Executive Support & Relationship\
  \ Officer, Robyn Curry, was kind enough to drive us down the off-road trail to the\
  \ shore and share with us how they proposed the land could be responsibly utilised\
  \ to ensure environmental sustainability. Instead, another big-business cruise ship\
  \ port on the fragile coast would mean severe coral degradation, demolition of natural\
  \ bushland and local fauna, exclusive access, and a prioritisation of foreign job\
  \ opportunities and investment. With this in mind, we walked along the beach in\
  \ silence and looked out across the sea as if it was already gone, obliterated in\
  \ some fiery apocalypse and we were the last survivors assessing the damage. I thought\
  \ of Carlie, who was a source of unlimited drive and adventure, someone who could\
  \ turn a life of minimalism and hard work into a wondrous dream that I envied, but\
  \ all of that relied on her ability to roam and connect with the natural world.\
  \ If the largest contributor to the Bahamian economy is income acquired from tourism,\
  \ what then is the result of tourism being prioritised over the wellbeing of the\
  \ local community and land when profitability is favoured over preservation? It\
  \ was clear to me in that moment that the degradation of nature in the quest for\
  \ profit across the Bahama Archipelago would soon force tourist interest to decline\
  \ if there was no natural beauty left to see. Facing the prospect of essentially\
  \ segregated and averting infrastructures of tourism, I recalled how Carlie had\
  \ once stashed an old jar from one of her roadside rubbish pickups, boasting its\
  \ usefulness for storing screws. Everything was a possibility to her. If only the\
  \ essence of tourism here was rooted in the same acceptance to humbly adjust and\
  \ make do in the beautiful reality of where one finds themselves."
