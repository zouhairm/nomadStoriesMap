Text: "The haggling began as soon as we stepped out of the airport. I didn't expect\
  \ that. Marrakesh was the first place I had been where price transparency didn't\
  \ operate as I was used to: unless you asked a local you would probably never really\
  \ know the fair value of what you paid for. I got into the taxi thinking I had probably\
  \ done an alright job at negotiating the fare. Having said that, there had mostly\
  \ been a lot of hand gesturing punctuated by my rudimentary French. I didn't know\
  \ exactly where we were going but I understood from the driver's expression there\
  \ was something dissatisfying about the address.\n\nI rolled down the windows in\
  \ the cab, as I always do. I wanted to absorb every moment of the experience: my\
  \ first time in Africa. The air is different there, the colour of the soil. I watched\
  \ motorbikes passing us on the road and felt a certain stiffness in my own body\
  \ as I contemplated the danger the riders were exposed to on those flimsy frames.\
  \ I smiled at Giovanni, sitting by my side and busily butchering Italian in an attempt\
  \ to make conversation with the driver whilst I sat back and let my thoughts run\
  \ over me. \n\nWe were staying in the Medina, the old city. The car wrapped itself\
  \ around impossibly narrower corners until we came to a small square. The driver\
  \ stopped, indicating that we should get out. A scholarly-looking boy we had passed\
  \ dressed in a blue robe came up to the car, and we were told he would show us the\
  \ way from here. The boy looked young, perhaps fifteen, but had a sharpness and\
  \ confidence about him that I trusted. A second boy appeared also, several years\
  \ older. Something about him aroused my suspicion and set me on edge. They were\
  \ brothers, and yet could not have induced in me a more different instinctive response.\
  \ \n\nThe latter peeled away into the bustle of the square, and Giovanni and I were\
  \ led by the bookish boy through the corridors of street too granular for the car.\
  \ It was a short walk to where we were staying, but we would never have found it\
  \ alone. I constantly looked around for signs I could use to find my way back, but\
  \ my attention was drawn always to avoiding a collision. \n\nWe made a right turn,\
  \ and went deeper into an alleyway, passing by a group of children whose stillness\
  \ I found strangely intimidating. In front of me I saw a tunnel, a slanted entrance\
  \ and water collating on the roof. The older brother had stealthily re-appeared\
  \ and walked beside our guide. He complimented my sunglasses and I smiled uneasily.\
  \ Giovanni stopped ahead of me at the tunnel. 'I'm not going through there' he voiced,\
  \ to whom exactly I was uncertain. \n\nThe younger boy seemed to beckon us forward.\
  \ In an instant, I remembered what I had read about the location online, how it\
  \ was tucked away and challenging to find. I understood why Giovanni had stopped.\
  \ It looked like the sort of tunnel where there would be people waiting for you\
  \ on the other side. Then, I literally saw light at the end of the tunnel and kept\
  \ going. Giovanni followed. \n\nThe two boys safely took us to the door of our Airbnb,\
  \ at which point they began to ask for money. They weren't asking for much, and\
  \ yet it seemed excessive for what had been merely minutes of their time. Part of\
  \ me didn't care about that. One of the boys took out a Nokia with a cracked screen.\
  \  I understood better why he might have thought my plastic discount sunglasses\
  \ were nice. I wondered, for a moment, whether I should give them to him. \n\n'Girl,\
  \ you go inside,' the young boy motioned to me. Money and negotiations were for\
  \ men only it seemed. I didn't expect that. But perhaps that was my mistake."
