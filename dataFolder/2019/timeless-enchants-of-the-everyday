Text: "Travelling across the border from the US and taking in deeply thick sighs,\
  \ an instant gratification of colossal trees into Canada by sight is sense new\n\
  \nRidges that crest upward into mountain ranges, fulfilling, for eyes that yearn\
  \ to seekout nature.\nGiving it's way from very distant treetops to close up evergreen\
  \ along roadside where no other vehicles were traveling was very motivating. Propelling\
  \ under the cumulous canopy moving northbound, toppled the hopes of reaching into\
  \ those smoky, silk billows that confirmed, headily, Ontario was nothing short from\
  \ enchanting, and borrowing, simultaneously, a homely accoutrement.\n\nIt took no\
  \ further than a daydream in the mind to find a park, more of natured means countlessly\
  \ essential of kempt conservational awareness, but nonetheless, exotic as it was\
  \ a mystery. Being a fan to nature, instantaneously, I wanted to run through it\
  \ and within, all these lines of pines. They seem to keep arriving, one after another,\
  \ whenever my eyes shifted. And soon, another park. Until then, I am left to realizing,\
  \ Canada is like many parks only carved into here and there with a few inhabitants\
  \ and modernization tucked among, which kept my energy revved throughout our stay.\n\
  \nAgreeably, we all stopped for the company between and made a short rest through\
  \ one of them that included a small lake and a grassy area to picnic. It was just\
  \ as warm and pleasant on the eyes as it was under the May afternoon sunlight.\n\
  \nFond of the idea to engulf as much as we could by sight before the meeting of\
  \ starfall upon our first night, we never unpacked the car and headed to the downtown\
  \ district of Niagara to exchange monies and seemingly fit into the flowing ebb\
  \ of a casual and kind population. There was an amazing view on Earth of the towering,\
  \ revolving Skylon restaurant and crashing waters we heard nearby simply enhanced\
  \ the vista.\n\nNeeding and coveting a true reveal of the countries\u2019 culture,\
  \ we headed into a local brewery establishment and enjoyed, fully, some pints of\
  \ beer, crafted by the Canadians themselves. And without disappointment, paid in\
  \ our golden dollar coins.\n\nThere, among boutique and shoppes of pubs and restaurants,\
  \ some souvenir spots, we saw the lights of streetlamps put out an authentic display\
  \ of electricity that instead of awe put me into an ethereal trance to intake as\
  \ much by nighttime as any human capable with this shared energy. First, stopping\
  \ into the Ripley's Believe It or Not.\n\nThis was an evident discovery, as not\
  \ many tourists took advantage of enterpassing the entrance seriously but once inside\
  \ awoke all the enticement of seeking out and consuming as much oddity and audacity\
  \ as the time itself nostalgic is best to tour during the dusk without the crowding\
  \ visitors. It took me by surprise how entertaining I found the exhibits, being\
  \ a know-it-all of pop-culture that I am, as it is conceded all was of tasteful\
  \ insight and might seem, otherwise, mundane as an attraction to unbeknown spectators.\n\
  \nNext, we all gathered around a vendor on a sidewalk corner deciding between chili\
  \ cheese dogs or corn dogs on sticks, very convenient, for a nighttime snack, and\
  \ appropriate for the hunger we gathered finding our group and making headway to\
  \ the last destination of the night, Niagara Falls.\n\nOnward, we gaited together\
  \ toward the crushing sound of water, racing between changing colors overhead, all\
  \ without a map, very easily accessible by foot and magnified our anticipations\
  \ by meandering our way upon the lovely and serene peacefulness of a gigantic waterfall\
  \ only Canada could cradle. Ecstatic by it's mirage between water, mist and color,\
  \ undoubtedly nighttime is the best possible way to encounter this wonder of the\
  \ world.\n\nAfter returning past midnight, we emptied our suitcases into an accommodating\
  \ hotel which included a continental breakfast each morning and enjoyed our find\
  \ of positively fine live bands playing until 3 am.\n\nThe next few days we spent\
  \ swerving a path through sidewalks and roadways, wearing matching t-shirts during\
  \ the day and nights, by bicycle, leavening conversations both under the jumping\
  \ neon and illuminating moonlights to visit many new escapes and made the accompanying\
  \ greets of others who partook our friendly banter."
