Text: "Once upon a time, when my friend and I were still just students, we decided\
  \ to go to Morocco. We did not know anything about this country \u2013 only stereotypes\
  \ from old TV-show \u201CO Clone\u201D. We went for the whole week and first couple\
  \ of days were all about sightseeing, looking for new staff on Medina and being\
  \ scared, that we have done something wrong.\n\nWe have dreamed about Sahara desert\
  \ and the ocean, since we do not have one in Russia. Therefore, that is why we went\
  \ to Essaouira with a local driver, who could not say a word in English. There we\
  \ saw the ocean \u2013 it was perfect and we decided to walk along the shore. However,\
  \ before we went to Medina \u2013 white walls, blue doors, narrow streets. Suddenly\
  \ it became very cold and started to rain so hard, so we had to run to our car.\n\
  \nWe had to give up our dream to soak our feet in an ocean waters \u2013 the weather\
  \ was so bad, so it even began to flood. There was so much water that we walked\
  \ knee-deep in it to the car. We needed to go away from Essaouira quickly.\n\nWe\
  \ went outside the city, weather was a lot better now, but we were sad \u2013 all\
  \ trip to Morocco began to look like a total disaster. And in that same moment I\
  \ looked outside the window and saw a got\u2026 on a tree! We stopped our car \u2013\
  \ and there were not one, but several goats! The shepherd told us in a very limited\
  \ English that because of the lack of the greenery in this area goats have to graze\
  \ in the trees!\n\nFrom complete disappointment to the joy of new discoveries! Turned\
  \ out, it was only a beginning of our true Moroccan adventures!\n\nOn the next day,\
  \ we went to Sahara \u2013 in just 2 days away from civilization we found out so\
  \ much new! For example, that without city lights the Moon shines at night as bright\
  \ as the Sun. That those shooting stars are not always meteors, sometimes they are\
  \ satellites! That berber wives live in one settlement, and husbands in totally\
  \ other. That to ride a camel is easy on the first day, and it becomes much harder\
  \ on the second one! That the simplest things can always be surprising, if you expect\
  \ interesting things from a trip and discover new secrets of local life."
