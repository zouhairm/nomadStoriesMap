Text: "Everything starts in a moment, an event leads to a thought and then is up to\
  \ you to make a choice and act. As it happened that night. When voices disturbed\
  \ my acoustic meatus. Interrupting the virtual peace of my sleep.\n\nIt was the\
  \ first time I was traveling by myself, the air was blowing by my side as I was\
  \ struggling to ride my bike as fast as possible, to get in time at the station.\
  \ Stress was overwhelming me, in thought of losing the train. Luckily I made it\
  \ in time, but i still remember my  trembling hands, as I was filling the interrail\
  \ pass. Within me there was this indescribable feeling,  of anxiety interwined with\
  \ the sense of adventure to the unknown, which accompanied me for the trip, as the\
  \ environment changed between the freedom of nature and the strict structure of\
  \ the cities. Lost in this pattern, time passed on the train. Suddenly, the announcement\
  \ of arrival at the Berlin train station came from the loudspeakers. \n\nIt was\
  \ a long day and finally I arrived in Berlin. At first glance, in front of me spanned\
  \ a big city, with large roads crossing imposing buildings, which at the moment\
  \ left me intimidated. After some moments standing lost, I took some deep breaths\
  \ and decided to head towards the hostel that would accomodate me. The hostel was\
  \ located next to Alexandreplatz where the Berlin TV tower stretched out high. I\
  \ lifted my head to look at the top of it but tonight no stars adorned the tower\
  \ but clouds, and the moonlight slightly passed through them . Upon arrival at the\
  \ hostel I headed directly to my room, which was empty at the time. I layed down\
  \ in my bed. As a sense of loneliness overwhelmed me,  my mind wandered to my friends\
  \ and the warmth of my family. Minutes later exhausted, I found sleep in the coziness\
  \ of my quilt.\n\n\_\_Time passed, when suddenly the door of the room opened and\
  \ light  spread throughout  the room. But it was not the light that interrupted\
  \ my sleep, but the two punk styled Irish men that rudely entered the room after\
  \ their night out. Quarreling in such a loud manner, that made it impossible to\
  \ not wake up. Funnily, after disturbing the sleep of everyone nearby, they calmed\
  \  down and decided to leave for one more drink. My irritation was obvious, through\
  \ my constant movements in my bed like a whirlwind, predisposing the rest of the\
  \ night. \n\nIn no case I could sleep anymore. So I decided to go for a stroll.\
  \ It was after midnight, in early September, and while there was a gentle air, causing\
  \ me to shiver, I would not characterize the climate cold. In the silence of the\
  \ city when the only sound that interrupts it, is that of light traffic, the sense\
  \ of loneliness started to emerge inside me again. In need to confront this feeling,\
  \ as well as in search of temporary relaxation I headed to the closest mini-market.\
  \ There I drank two beers of Berlin origin, their intense taste created an unprecedented\
  \ pleasure in my palate, as alcohol helped me relax. With renewed spirit I decided\
  \ to further stray in the streets in search of a place for my night out.\n\n My\
  \ quest led me  in front of  House of Weekend, a well established techno club of\
  \ Berlin. I succesfuly managed to pass the trial of the fierce looking gatekeepers,\
  \ who checked my attire. Inside the club, you could feel the music embrasing your\
  \ body. People of different stylistic types were dancing expressing  their inner\
  \ self, passion  that was confined inside them due to their daily lifes expressed\
  \ in the form of dance. There, in this landscape of no identification,  I found\
  \ myself enjoying dancing like I never had before. Becoming lost in the music. As\
  \ sweat was running through my body, I smiled relieved.\n\nLater as I was heading\
  \ back, I looked at the sky,  the clouds were gone and under the moon the splendor\
  \ of the city was illuminated. A city build like it was ment for gods to live in,\
  \ beautiful but distant. Part of my memories, part of myself."
