Text: "Few cities provide such a visceral welcome as Makassar. \n\nOnce absorbed by\
  \ the the high-speed highways, it\u2019s a scary and thrilling jolt into island\
  \ life in Indonesia. Deep inside the congested roads leading to the city\u2019s\
  \ pride pantai losari, man and machine coexist in a perplexing show of organized\
  \ chaos. Becak drivers pull their weight along with that of up to two other people\u2014\
  \ sometimes sans shoes\u2014while semi trucks force fume out of their exhaust pipes\
  \ and out into the steaming humid air. The becaks and cars weave circles around\
  \ each other. It\u2019s a dizzying and brilliant show of modernization and tradition;\
  \ a demonstration of the historic once-Dutch port city\u2019s constant evolution\
  \ and movement.\n\nIn Makassar, being a tourist is less common than it is in Bali,\
  \ Sulawesi\u2019s famous island neighbor to the south. Curiosity abounds here and\
  \ the lack of English isn\u2019t a barrier to exchanging pleasantries with locals.\
  \ The people are extremely friendly, radiating the same energy and warmth as the\
  \ searing South East Asian sun. The sunsets in Makassar inspire awe in the way only\
  \ a city perched at the belly of the earth can. Fiery reds, pinks, yellows, purples\u2014\
  each color fights for its few last minutes before fading away behind the Makassar\
  \ strait.\n\nThere are many things to discover in the city, but the most memorable\
  \ past time? Eating.\n\nIn fact, eating at the late-night street markets and open-air\
  \ restaurants is maybe the most Makassar-esque thing you can do. Dining is a festive\
  \ and uniting force not only in Makassar, but in all of Indonesia. One of the first\
  \ questions tourists are asked involves, \u201Chave you tried\u201D? Sitting to\
  \ the table for fish or local specialties promises a spicy, tangy, and fresh showmanship\
  \ of Middle Eastern and Chinese influences."
