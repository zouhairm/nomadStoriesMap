Text: "The nomadic campsite was about one hour drive from the village of Wadi Rum,\
  \ in the Jordanian desert. \nThe camp was a black stain in the red sand. There were\
  \ two big tents. Each tent had a sort of porch and a part that was closed on 3 sides.\
  \ The fourth side was open, but coming up to huge rocks, to prevent people from\
  \ seeing inside. A few men roamed around taking care of the camels and goats. They\
  \ all wore black. Kids ran around like colourful birds. Hidden in the most secluded\
  \ part of the biggest tent was a woman, also wearing black. \nThe days seemed to\
  \ never end. Most of the time was spent sitting on cushions and drinking tea mixed\
  \ with camel milk. It was too hot to move. \nIt was Mazen, an old man I knew from\
  \ Palestine, who had invited me there. Sometimes Mazen and I would go around and\
  \ climb to the top of rocky mountains. \nSometimes we would follow the boys who\
  \ followed the goats. \nThe chief, Mazen's friend, was a desert ranger. His main\
  \ job was driving through the dunes, killing poisonous snakes and visiting other\
  \ nomadic communities. \nHis wife - Noor - never left the tent because men were\
  \ always around. At times her kids would drag me there, and we would play games\
  \ and eat the bread and goat cheese she made. She talked to her husband and kids\
  \ through the black curtain that circumscribed her space.  \n\nOn the second day\
  \ the chief left to take the kids to school in Wadi Rum. Mazen and I remained at\
  \ the campsite. Noor was on the other side of the curtain, as usual. \nMazen suggested\
  \ I go talk to her, he would stay on the porch and translate our conversation from\
  \ there. \nSo I lifted the curtain and joined Noor. I asked her in Arabic how she\
  \ was doing today. She said she was hot. \nI didn't know what else to say. I told\
  \ Mazen, as if hoping that he would allow me to go back to where he was, to the\
  \ rest of the world beyond that black curtain. They spoke for a bit in Arabic, nothing\
  \ that I could understand. Then he invited me to talk to Noor some more; he insisted\
  \ that I tried to connect.\nI felt uncomfortable, but really only because I didn't\
  \ know what to say. It was like being at a friend's grandma's place. Your friend\
  \ goes to the bathroom, and you sit there on the couch for those three never-ending\
  \ minutes wondering what to say, wondering whether you shouldn't pretend that you\
  \ suddenly need to go as well and look for your friend. Then you remember that you\
  \ are a grown up and just find something to talk about. \nAnd that is what I did.\
  \ I told Noor that I really liked her bread, and if she could tell me how she made\
  \ it. She fetched the ingredients and we started kneading the mixture of flour,\
  \ water and goat butter. She calmly dictated instructions that bounced through the\
  \ black curtain and returned to me in a language that I could understand. \nDoing\
  \ something together was the best way to connect. It reduced the need for translation.\
  \ We didn't need Mazen all that much anymore. I knew, however, that he wanted to\
  \ be involved. In the week we had spent together in the village he had often used\
  \ my visit as an excuse to be allowed in the presence of the women so he could talk\
  \ to them. \nOnce the bread was ready, Noor and I sat on the ground. I asked how\
  \ long they had been in that campsite, where they would go next, how long it would\
  \ take to pack their stuff and how they chose their locations. \nMazen was a few\
  \ meters away from us, sitting on the cushions and sipping tea. I knew that sometimes\
  \ he peeked through the curtain to look at her, to get a glimpse of that feminine\
  \ universe that he knew so little about. I knew that he was happy I was talking\
  \ to her. I could feel his benevolent smile through the black curtain."
