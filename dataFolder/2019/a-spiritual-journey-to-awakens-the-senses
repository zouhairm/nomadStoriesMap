Text: "I sense we are closing in on our destination before I even see it out the dust-smeared\
  \ plane window. The air in the cabin suddenly feels thick and sticky, the air-conditioning\
  \ unable to compete with the hot and humid tropical microclimate trailing below.\
  \ Peering out, I see a never-ending stretch of verdant foliage, like a canopy of\
  \ broccoli - thick, deep green in colour and densely clustered. Carving through\
  \ the vast land is a meandering brown river - Rio Madre De Dio - literally meaning\
  \ \u201CMother of God River\u201D. An appropriate name for a river that gives life\
  \ to thousands of unique flora and fauna not found anywhere else in the world.\n\
  \u201CThis is it!\u201D I say excitedly to my husband, who is busily wiping sweat\
  \ from his shiny, flustered face. I had to pinch myself. It was there, we were flying\
  \ over the legendary Amazon, the \u201Clungs of the earth\u201D. I took a deep,\
  \ excited breath. We had arrived. \nA jolty, jumpy bus ride from Puerto Maldonado\
  \ airport to the banks of the Amazon, past small villages with huts built of stones,\
  \ hidden behind overgrown banana palms and papaya trees. Recent rains had washed\
  \ away sections of the road and left our mini-bus clinging to a windy, pot-hole\
  \ ridden dirt trail that the ever-smiling driver carefully picked his way through,\
  \ just like he evidently did every single day he made the journey. Arriving at dock,\
  \ our tour group hops aboard a long, skinny boat and waved off by our friendly bus\
  \ rider. We are seated and given life jackets and its not long before the entire\
  \ group is madly clicking away on their cameras as we start off down the river,\
  \ headed towards our eco-rainforest lodge. I quickly sense this journey will be\
  \ unlike any other. This is where Mother Nature reigns supreme and I was here to\
  \ embrace every single, life-affirming moment. About 10 minutes into an hour-long\
  \ boat ride and I begin to notice the deep, earthy smell of the silted river, a\
  \ rich chocolate brown colour, flowing rapidly, bubbling and gurgling along. We\
  \ listen earnestly to our Peruvian tour guide, Joel, as he fascinates us with stories\
  \ of all the animals you\u2019d expect to hear: piranhas,\nanacondas, macaws, monkeys\
  \ and suddenly: there is silence from the group. All eyes\nand ears straining against\
  \ the sounds beating out from the untamed wilderness. It feels magical, mythical,\
  \ my heart and mind is racing. I desperately want to see something, anything to\
  \ define the moment. At last, a flock of brightly coloured macaws breaks from the\
  \ tree tops and it\u2019s a liberating feeling. Almost like the Amazon has proven\
  \ itself to me, but also reinforcing the notion that I was now officially within\
  \ the depths of the wild, and leaving humanity way, way behind. As we trail deeper\
  \ into our watery journey, the sky takes on a deep orange hue, changing to purple\
  \ and signalling sunet. I notice a sense of stillness as the sounds of animated\
  \ monkeys and various birds get quieter. Suddenly, it\u2019s only the sound of the\
  \ water breaking over the bow. \u201CPeople always ask if anacondas are dangerous\
  \ and if they are always in the water. I tell them the villagers swim in this river\
  \ all the time,\u201D he says, as if to ward off any potential concerns. Mental\
  \ note to myself, regardless of that fact I\u2019ll still happily stay on land whilst\
  \ on this adventure. \u201CKeep an eye out for caimans though, you might see one\
  \ along here,\u201D Joel adds. Keen eyes flit from ripple to ripple, as bubble trails\
  \ and driftwood move along the water. Could it be a stray caiman, the notoriously\
  \ shy creature that lurks beneath the depths of these rapid waters? At last, the\
  \ boat pulls up to what still seems like an impermeable section of forest. We had\
  \ arrived. Goosebumps crawl over my arms and legs, or maybe it\u2019s my body reacting\
  \ to the endless mosquitoes that suddenly appear as we near the forest edges. I\
  \ take another deep breath, ready to be taken into the depths of forest, already\
  \ knowing this would be an experience unlike any other."
