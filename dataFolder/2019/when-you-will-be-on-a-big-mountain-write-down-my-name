Text: "It was that rainy and dark yesterday I could not even put up my tent. Now it\
  \ is sunny and warm morning. Yesterday the whole cafe nearby was really curious\
  \ about me and my way. I packed my luggage and went there. After breakfast, I went\
  \ to a highway.\n\nThe first car brought me just for few kilometers forward, but\
  \ to a much better position to hitchhike. In a few minutes stopped another car with\
  \ a couple who asked cash for the trip. Declined their offer, I came back on the\
  \ road. In a couple of minutes stopped an old car with some materials for building\
  \ inside.\n\nIt was an Orthodox priest. We spoke about my trip, about Siberia I\
  \ just entered, about people and about what's going on in the society. He was quite\
  \ surprised by my journey and my choice, dropping me in a town, he left me 1000\
  \ roubles even though I did not want to receive it. He said that I need it more\
  \ and I will understand everything later.\n\nAfter tea in a local cafe, I came back\
  \ to the highway. I picked a truck driver who listened for load music. It was still\
  \ hot outside and we saw how a rubber of another car got burned. He connected with\
  \ him by radio and that truck stopped to fix it.\n\nIt already was a sunset when\
  \ I arrived at the point I planned to reach that day. I picked a microbus and went\
  \ through Omsk to the city\_center.\n\n\u2018\u2019Despite Omsk is a city with over\
  \ 1 million population, it contains literally only typical Soviet architecture\u2019\
  \u2019, - that was a thing I thought about until I noticed one lady in a microbus\
  \ started crying.\n\nI left the microbus on the Central Railway Station and went\
  \ to explore the city. Its still was literally nothing to watch on. About midnight\
  \ I met a couple who became really qurious about my backpacker\u2019s look. We spoke\
  \ about 30 minutes about my trip and what I already discovered. They asked if I\
  \ need something and even though I told I dont they brought a water and an ice-cream\
  \ (the most expensive over that store) for me.\n\nI continued my way through the\
  \ city of typical architecture and very untypical people. When I went along a sushi-bar,\
  \ some luxury-suited young people showed me thumbs up sign. For sure they recognized\
  \ I am a hitchhiker. These people have funds for luxury suites and luxury places\
  \ visiting, they know where they will lay to sleep this night, but they still a\
  \ bit envy to me.\n\nNext person I payed attention to was a breaking beautiful young\
  \ girl crying on a bus stop. Young, beautiful, crying alone in the big city.\n\n\
  I went through the night and huge city I just became aquinted with. I noticed a\
  \ \_middle-age man goes the same direction like me. He spoke by phone and cried.\
  \ Cried not like men do. The man wept.\n\nA night. A middle age man. On the street\
  \ alone. He cries. I remember all the things happenned with me that day. Priest\
  \ sharing money. People bought ice-cream. Guys simply showing thimbs-up.\n\nI decided\
  \ to go slower. Even though we went about 15 minutes on the same way, he continued\
  \ crying. When he went along me, a street of Omsk cought my question:\n\n\u201C\
  Whats up, bro?\u201D\n\n\u2018\u2019Nothing, I am going to kill my mother now\u2019\
  \u2019 , - he said and continued weeping.\n\nIn the next two minutes, he shared\
  \ that he divorsed and because of his wife and mother cant meet his daughter anymore\
  \ because they do not allow. He did not see any reason to live no more.\n\nWe continued\
  \ to speak. After two minutes he did not cry anymore. Told all the most important\
  \ part of his story, he became very much interested about mine. I shared an information\
  \ about my hitchhking trip, that I am the first time in his city and so on. We had\
  \ an ordinar conversation as we were aquinted in years.\n\nWe went through those\
  \ districts, dark at 3 AM. We spoke like old friends even though one hour ago we\
  \ did not suspect another person exists. Looks like this city, so typical and sleepy\
  \ at that time, accumulated all the emotions around two of us. He offered to bring\
  \ me to the place in his car. He found his car and picked me up. He considered he\
  \ helps me and its matter. When he dropped me on the point outside the city, he\
  \ said: \u2018\u2019Don\u2019t forget kind Omsk people. When you will be on a big\
  \ mountain, write down my name. Omsk. Leonid\u2019\u2019.\n\nI smiled. He smiled\
  \ me back.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRyazan \u2013 Vladivostok hitchhiking trip, Day 8\n\n\
  30 July, 2011"
