Text: "I still remember his laugh. The type of sincere and real laugh that people\
  \ let go of themselves sometimes. \n\nNo shoes on his feet, long hair, a smiling\
  \ and relaxed expression, a mind full of ideas, dreams and vision: an Ecuadorian\
  \ living at the Galapagos Islands who confesses: \u201CI have lived here for so\
  \ long and there is so much more for me to explore!\u201D. He surfs on waters surrounded\
  \ by sharks, has a friend who's a sea lion, and lays above waters full of plankton,\
  \ under a black universe filled with lightened dots. \n\nBut everything has a price.\
  \ For these, he had to renounce to his family heritage, his college studies and\
  \ even a girlfriend.\n\n\u201CI can\u2019t disapprove the system if I\u2019m part\
  \ of it\u201D. He moves his wet and just washed blonde hair away from his eyes.\
  \ Then smiles again. I can feel the happiness, the freedom that comes along with\
  \ the ocean\u2019s breeze. \n\nHe introduces me to his kitchen: a barbecue structure,\
  \ next to a table and plastic chairs, and a type of mini-lagoon that gets filled\
  \ with the Pacific\u2019s water when the tide rises and emptied when it goes down.\
  \ There are some posters on the walls, walls that do not surround his bedroom, as\
  \ he sleeps inside a tent, located under the trees, maybe 8 meters away from the\
  \ kitchen. An organic plant nursery, a hand-made solar panel, \u201Cand the beach\
  \ is only 50 meters away!\u201D, he says, as referring to the blue water located\
  \ ahead of us. \n\nWhat do I admire from him? Authenticity. \u201CFlaca, can you\
  \ check if I have lices?\u201D or \u201CFlaca, I can be called a hippie, but I smell\
  \ so badly now, that I can call myself a real hippie\u201D. \n\nWhen you get a message,\
  \ after months of meeting someone, where you read \u201CHonestly, you are one of\
  \ the persons who really know who I am\u201D, it\u2019s a fact: you did it! For\
  \ that, I smile. Because that\u2019s what I wanted, to get to know him well. \n\n\
  Galapagos. A group of islands full of unique species. The place where Darwin\u2019\
  s theory was developed: where the impossible reaches reality and the sky gets illuminated\
  \ when volcanoes feel it\u2019s time for the solid surface to be expanded. The contrast\
  \ contained at an oasis within the desert, within first and second appearances.\
  \ Slow turtle paces shared among less than two thousand locals. The degrade that\
  \ flows between multiple shades of blue. The paradise where my jungle friend flies\
  \ free.\n\nIf you visit Isabela Island, try to keep your eyes opened and perhaps\
  \ you\u2019ll find him riding on his bike or walking down the flamenco\u2019s path.\
  \ Maybe he\u2019ll be diving and swimming with turtles, sea lions, and possibly\
  \ one or two sting rays at Concha Perla\u2019s crystal-clear turquoise waters. If\
  \ not, ask any local for the \u201CTarzan\u201D of the island. They will easily\
  \ address you to him. Small islands work the old-fashioned way.\n\nHe couldn\u2019\
  t host me those days, but one afternoon, while walking down the dirt street, I got\
  \ a message. I replied. Then heard a voice behind me: \u201C\u2026I\u2019m going\
  \ to eat\u201D. It was the first time we saw each other. He looked just like in\
  \ the Couchsurfing app photos, a bit shorter, I must tell.\n\nLess than a week was\
  \ needed for getting to know him properly. He didn\u2019t expect to make me fall\
  \ for him, neither do I. But while I was waving good bye I got surprised by life.\
  \ Was I in-love with \u201CGeorge\u201D? (I started calling him like this due to\
  \ his similarity to \u201CGeorge of the jungle\u201D). I admired him deeply, and\
  \ true love emerges from that: admiration. Had I felt in-love by experiencing him?\
  \ By being able to connect with the fundamentals, with nature? By having an encounter\
  \ with essence? Had I, once more, experienced traveling?\n\n\u201CAnd what do you\
  \ expect from life?\u201D - I asked. \u201CI don\u2019t expect anything from it.\
  \ I don\u2019t mind about being surprised by life, I want to be the one that surprises\
  \ life!\u201D. \n\nThen, one day, at my hometown, I got to enter into the party\
  \ I\u2019d planned to attend. And there he was. Smiling as always\u2026Tarzan was\
  \ in the city."
