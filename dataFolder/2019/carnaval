Text: "It rained the whole week. This is S\xE3o Paulo, the greatest city in South\
  \ America, so a rainy day means traffic jams, unbearable hot weather and the feeling\
  \ that the city is too crowded. But not in the last days of February, not in Brazil.\
  \ This week is the Carnaval. Today, the country is polarized. A controversial presidential\
  \ election led to a very tense, sometimes aggressive, political climate. Most Brazilians\
  \ are in one of two sides, which are opposites. Like never before, any conversation\
  \ with natives ends up being about the government and why the other political view\
  \ is wrong. As an immigrant is easy to see why such heated discussions are taking\
  \ place. Just by walking at Pra\xE7a da S\xE9 (the city\u2019s main square) the\
  \ contrasty social classes that interact in this complex society is shocking. Besides\
  \ a beautiful and perfectly maintained one hundred years old theater dozens of homeless\
  \ families have their shacks and, in front of one of these, the children of these\
  \ families have a passionate soccer game, just in the middle of the square. In addition\
  \ to the unequal economy, a lot of corruption cases as well as the huge inflation\
  \ and several wrongly handled environmental disasters are some reasons of this phenomena.\
  \ As a foreigner, being a close spectator of such a dramatical moment in the history\
  \ of this country feels like a privilege. I\u2019ve been living in \u201CSampa\u201D\
  \ (as some people call S\xE3o Paulo) for the last three months. Different from other\
  \ cities I have lived in before, this is a megapolis. It took me several weeks to\
  \ get used to the natural but sporadic movement that vibrates through these streets.\
  \ Everybody is getting late to somewhere. Somehow, it seems that the only people\
  \ that are actually enjoying themselves are the elders. They are the ones in music\
  \ concerts, film shows, plastic arts exhibition, lectures or courses. All day, all\
  \ night the city is on, the city is busy. With this in mind, I had no clue on what\
  \ was going to happen in my first Carnaval. Normally, when I get to the subway the\
  \ atmosphere is heavy. Suited businessmen, college students and the casual users\
  \ push each other in order to find a place in the already full train wagons. Yet,\
  \ even with the same amount of people, the feeling is different. There are music\
  \ and laughs in the air. The usual clothes have changed; almost everybody is costumed\
  \ for the celebration. This year theme is the beach, in consequence most people\
  \ are half-naked.  I\u2019m going downtown. A friend told me that there is where\
  \ the best \u201Cbloquinhos\u201D (a random group of people that want to celebrate)\
  \ take place. I leave the station and the burning sun is just in the middle of the\
  \ sky, the music is loud and the multitudes are dancing. The main streets had been\
  \ closed for vehicles, there is people of all ages, all ethnicities, all classes.\
  \ All around, the lines that segregate vanish, the celebration is on and everybody\
  \ is invited. Although I\u2019ve been here a short period of time, it is really\
  \ hard not to relate because you see these people that usually ignore each other\
  \ joining together for not other reasons that just for the sake of it. Carnaval\
  \ is not a party, it is an amazing event where humans that identify as \u201CBrasileiros\u201D\
  \ see themselves reflected in each others faces. They see their problems and choose\
  \ to ignore them, just for a while, because they know they feel the same. I see\
  \ them welcoming me, giving me the chance to understand that, apart from where we\
  \ come from or who we are, we are the same. At least, we are the same for a couple\
  \ of days."
