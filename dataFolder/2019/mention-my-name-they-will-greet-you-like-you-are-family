Text: "It seems travel can reunite us with friends and family, and perhaps reacquaint\
  \ us with our ourselves. I hope you can take away a little inspiration from my story\
  \ and remember that your home is where you feel welcome.\n\nI did not expect any\
  \ of this when I went on holidays. I found myself on a train to Jasper, Canada.\
  \ My friend and I had got on in Vancouver and almost instantly a family from New\
  \ Zealand became our own. We brought in the new year on that train. Someone had\
  \ found a bottle of Scotch. Someone else found the nerve to play a ukulele. In the\
  \ middle of no where, in the middle of the night, we all sung, laughed and became\
  \ family. The whole train in fact joined us. We even met a local duo from Calgary\
  \ who could do a rendition of any jazz or rock classic you could think of. These\
  \ are the experiences that make me realise how enormously rewarding our journeys\
  \ can be if we simply open our eyes and our hearts to the possibilities. But anyone\
  \ could enjoy this, right? \n\nWell I kept my eyes open but my heart closed for\
  \ a long time because most experiences are not that palatable. Yes I loved to travel,\
  \ I had an adventurous step and a keen eye, but, you know when you fly solo, and\
  \ sit in your seat looking down the isle shamefully, hoping the wide load coming\
  \ down will not sit next to you? Well yes, I can honestly say I was that person\
  \ until a man sat next to me in 2016 on a plane headed from Darwin to Perth, via\
  \ what I could only describe as the middle of nowhere, otherwise known as Alice\
  \ Springs. He was massive. He was so tall that I felt he could touch the top of\
  \ the cabin with his head. His shoulders were so wide. I would have bet anything\
  \ he could take up two seats. He smiled and said 'looks like I have the pleasure\
  \ of your company for the next few hours'. Well I did not expect that!\n\nWe began\
  \ to chat about what brought us to Darwin. Within three hours I had found out that\
  \ his grandmother was born in the same part of the world as I, that he was a police\
  \ officer in Alice Springs, and that he loved learning about other cultures. When\
  \ I told him a little about me, my journey as a refugee to Australia, my work with\
  \ multicultural communities in Western Australia and my love of cultures too, well\
  \ I felt like I had just met a long lost friend. It turned out he was a Moari man\
  \ from New Zealand, and in his small town on the north island, he had friends who\
  \ had come through as refugees from other countries, including mine. He said, 'if\
  \ you ever find yourself meandering through my home, mention my name, and they will\
  \ greet you like you are family, well you might be related to my grandma, you never\
  \ know!' \n\nGetting off that flight I had walked away with this thought in my mind\
  \ - I had planned great adventures and holidays with my best friend, but the journeys\
  \ that reconnect us with ourselves often happen when we least expect. So next time\
  \ I travel solo I will greet the person coming through the aisle. They may look\
  \ different, smell bad, speak funny or be standoffish, but each has lived a lifetime\
  \ of adventures which they may share if I greet them like family.\n\nSo having been\
  \ inspired by fate, this April I am finally visiting New Zealand, to meet the lovely\
  \ family I never knew I had."
