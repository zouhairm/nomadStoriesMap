Text: "Assisi, appearing like a sandy castle amongst the green hillside, came into\
  \ view. \n\nI was pressed against the window, mainly because the stranger next to\
  \ me kept warning he got carsick easily, but also because of all things, a freaking\
  \ rainbow was arched over the hilltop town. \n\nOK, this is definitely a dream this\
  \ time. I thought. \n\nThat entire trip I feared I would wake up in my bed at home\
  \ and discover none of this happened. But I didn\u2019t. \n\nIt was my first trip\
  \ out of the country--one of my first trips at all. Growing up in a big family,\
  \ it was financially impossible, and also impossible to get everyone\u2019s schedules\
  \ to match up. So, during March of 2016, I travelled to Italy by myself. It was\
  \ the place I wanted to go the most in the entire world, as if fascinated me, and\
  \ also was the place my ancestors came from. \n\nThe antiquity of everything shocked\
  \ me. Everything was art: the doors, the ceilings, the panels carved with insane\
  \ detail, the cobblestone streets, the cats lazing on the ancient ruins\u2026\n\n\
  Coming from the Maritimes of Canada, this was an entirely new world. \n\nTo be at\
  \ the Roman Forum during the Ides of March, where the Julius Caesar play was being\
  \ held in Italian: I pinched myself just in case. \n\nAn elderly woman next to me\
  \ laughed at something and started talking to me in a friendly tone. I had learned\
  \ some Italian and managed to be conversational with waiters and cashiers, but this\
  \ was something entirely differently. To be honest, I had no clue what she was saying,\
  \ but I could guess, and managed to have a conversation entirely through guessing,\
  \ and yet it worked. I must admit, it also boosted my ego how people assumed I was\
  \ a native Italian speaker, as if I belonged there.\n\nThe first night, I panicked.\
  \ Culture shock mixed with the fact that I hadn\u2019t slept in 48 hours because\
  \ of mere excitement (and my inability to sleep on planes). Before I left, people\
  \ gave  advice on bad situations that might happen and I let myself get paranoid.\
  \ \n\nYet, as each day passed, I became more confident. \n\nI was no longer staring\
  \ at pictures wistfully and saying \u201Cone day\u201D. This was that chance, and\
  \ I wouldn\u2019t let my paranoia of being out of Canada for the first time scare\
  \ me. By the end of the trip, I didn\u2019t want to go home. \n\nFlorence, Sorrento,\
  \ Naples, Pompeii, Rome, Pisa, Assisi. \n\nI walked through the cities by myself,\
  \ taking in the sights. \n\nOne of the things I loved the most was the constant\
  \ sound of church bells. It sounds strange, but there\u2019s no church bells where\
  \ I live. Simple things like a bell tolling filled me with awe.  \n\nGrowing up,\
  \ I went to a church called St. Francis of Assisi, and now I was at the actual Basilica\
  \ of San Francesco d'Assisi. \n\nIt would be easy to get swooned by the tourist\
  \ attractions, yet I found myself more drawn to the little places where no one was\
  \ around where I could find peace. I wanted the authenticity. I didn\u2019t want\
  \ anyone speaking English to me or the crowded sights where you had to elbow by\
  \ people (though I did find the sights beautiful too). \n\nIt was the adventure\
  \ of it all that lit something within me, something that continues today and begs\
  \ to see and explore more. The adventure of wandering around a sleepy village, not\
  \ quite knowing where you are, and stumbling into a 10th-century tiny church with\
  \ not a soul around. \n\nBy the end when I had to, to my dismay, go home, I was\
  \ reassured that I was ready to see the world. This trip was supposed to be the\
  \ scary first one, and now that it was under my belt, my overwhelming wanderlust\
  \ and newfound confidence told me I was ready to face the world."
