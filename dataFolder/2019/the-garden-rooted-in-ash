Text: "The theory of beauty is rooted in an archaic formula that is generically spread\
  \ without conceptualizing the various forms in which its origin stems. Like the\
  \ tree that has paid its dues with its branches that reflect it's many lessons,\
  \ beauty, in its most raw form, has many elements that have been lost over time.\
  \ Traveling to various countries allows our growth and viewpoint of beauty to bloom\
  \ like the rarest flower and grow like the tallest tree. The interaction with the\
  \ local people and the knowledge acquired from the teachings of the elders, helps\
  \ to restore the beauty that is lost in the ignorance of man and media. \n\nUnbeknownst\
  \ to the untrained eye, Guatemala is the embodiment of the rose that blooms from\
  \ the concrete. Violence, poverty and a lack of interest are the ingredients of\
  \ a failed recipe brewed by media's ignorance and irrational fears. Taking a leap\
  \ of faith and embarking on a childlike element of curiosity that never truly dims,\
  \ I ventured to Guatemala to explore its rich history. \n\nFrom the picturesque\
  \ views of their mountains and volcanoes approaching landing, to the professional\
  \ note of architecture that incorporated elements of tribal design, was more than\
  \ we were expecting. Upon landing, my friend and I immediately were taken aback\
  \ on the extent of raw beauty that the landscape offered. Vibrant colors adorned\
  \ the airport and various buildings on our route to our hotel. Sculpted tribal scenes\
  \ brought the untold stories of the ancestors as we followed its storyline on neighboring\
  \ sidewalks. Despite the precaution to avoid violence prior to our departure, we\
  \ alwere thankfully only met with warmth and hospitality.\n\nHospitality is always\
  \ a welcoming ice breaker when you are venturing into a new territory; however,\
  \ so is great food. From the culinary mastery of cuisines that are rooted in their\
  \ ancestor's teachings, our tastebuds went on a welcomed rollercoaster of satisfaction.\
  \ Golden brown fried sweet plantain with refried beans and we'll seasoned scrambled\
  \ eggs was accompanied by freshly squeezed juices and fresh water on a daily basis.\
  \ Warm buttered croissants and tasty pastries were only a ten minute commute to\
  \ the city center and only set you back $5 for a basket full of treats. Not only\
  \ did the cuisine master local dishes, they also incorporated international cuisines\
  \ to create a well appreciated take on well known greats, such as homemade pastas.\n\
  \nWith food, great service and a lovely hotel, we felt greedy to expect more from\
  \ this already breathtaking experience; however, Guatemala had more in store for\
  \ us. Venturing to one of their famous volcanoes, we ventured on a two hour hike\
  \ up the path of an active volcano. One of the most tiring hikes that I've ventured\
  \ on, in all of my travels, I surely felt that the baked goods may have stunted\
  \ my athletic prowess; however, once we made it to the top, it made every panting\
  \ breath worth it. \n\nOver looking the remote city that this volcano was located\
  \ in, we saw, what could easily be compared to, the Garden of Eden. Vibrant colors,\
  \ tall trees, and tranquility assaulted your senses along with the dogs that the\
  \ locals say lay on the warm volcanic rocks. Luckily we were able to see such a\
  \ wonderful site, for the volcano erupted weekend later.\n\nFrom the people, to\
  \ the culture and customs, to the views and the amazing food, Guatemala is a country\
  \ that transformed me. As an immigrant from Jamaica, I have always been able to\
  \ see the beauty in many things that the media and man may not, but after experiencing\
  \ Guatemala, it is now my life's goal to show the hidden beauty around the world.\
  \ This country showed me how their culture, customs and terrain are the elements\
  \ of their garden that can thrive through the ash of people's ignorance and for\
  \ that, I will be eternally grateful."
