Text: The country of diversity on each step from morden amenities of Bangalore to
  elegance and beautiful old city of Jaipur where culture history and technology travel
  hand in hand it left a deep impact on me and the way I look at the city not just
  the heritage places like naharghar ,amerfort add to the beauty but people have there
  own stories related to these places as one can see the wax museum at naharghar to
  the devotional mystic enviorment at Amer fort ,people are what makes this place
  a wonderful journey they are always ready to give you a helping hand and everyone
  is so well wersed and proud of there history ,the people prove that this land is
  truly heaven on earth where peace lies in every heart and soul so is the stories
  prevailed in society every single road has unique name and purpose jhori bazzar
  for instance jhori mean jeweller and so is this market full of jewellers best place
  to buy morden and ethnic jewellery then Lal ji Sandh ka rasta where you can shop
  for books followed by new gate there you can taste the exotic drink neera made of
  dates juice it's a wonderland where at every turn you crosses a little vintage world
  imbibed in to the morden scenario .
