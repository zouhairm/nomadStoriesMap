Text: "\u201CNice how quiet it is innit?\u201D said a wrinkled Caucasian with a thick\
  \ English accent. I had been sitting at a caf\xE9 patio, absorbing Dutch sun with\
  \ another traveller I\u2019d met earlier, Tom, who was looking up directions after\
  \ we\u2019d gotten lost in the Jordaan district. The caf\xE9 was on a quiet intersection,\
  \ the only sounds from the occasional fietsbell (bicycle bell) and the roar of the\
  \ tram going over the canal bridge adjacent to it. Most of the people around seemed\
  \ to be the elderly, leisurely strolling or biking through the streets. It was different,\
  \ and not just different in Amsterdam being an area not as frequented by backpackers\
  \ and tourists. In so many places, North America included, the elderly are hidden\
  \ behind closed doors in a nursing home or hospital, but in Amsterdam it was different;\
  \ the elderly were always seen. \n\nTom answered before me, \u201CYeah, nothing\
  \ like Liverpool, mind you.\u201D The man cracked a smile, revealing his crooked\
  \ teeth and laughed wholeheartedly, taking a puff out of the spliff (a joint mixed\
  \ with tobacco). \u201CYou think that\u2019s bad, try living in London!\u201D The\
  \ next hour he spent describing the years he spent in London. Living in a popular\
  \ place, he said he was always afflicted by what he called \u201Cthe busy-body fever\u201D\
  \ always running around from one point to the next. He loved London, but he didn\u2019\
  t want to be a \u201Cbusy-body\u201D for the rest of his life. \n\nHe reminded me\
  \ a lot of myself, hating \u201Cthe busy-body fever\u201D and wanting to finally\
  \ relax. It was the reason I was here. After finishing my first year of university\
  \ I felt depleted, both intellectually and creatively, having been pushed to my\
  \ limits that year. My parents noticed and insisted on paying for me to travel,\
  \ expecting me to go to Mexico or Cuba with my friends. Instead, I looked at Europe,\
  \ wanting both relaxation and to be able to fully experience a new culture. \n\n\
  The man continued in his story, telling of how his family offered to help him move\
  \ into a nursing home in Cornwall by a beach but he refused, not willing to give\
  \ up the city-life he had grown accustomed to, nor be an elderly person that rotted\
  \ away in a home. After researching a bit, he decided to come to Amsterdam. He didn\u2019\
  t care for the city\u2019s nightlife, or reputation for being marihuana (marijuana)\
  \ central, but he cared about the approaches to elder care that the Dutch government\
  \ had been making to increase the happiness of the senior population, \u201CThey\u2019\
  re not trying to stick us in any old home. The Dutch care about everyone\u2019s\
  \ happiness, not just the youngins.\u201D\n\nOne of these initiatives is a village\
  \ called Hogeweyk, located just outside Amsterdam, made specifically to care for\
  \ seniors with severe dementia, or Alzheimer\u2019s disease. The entire village\
  \ is carefully curated, having facilities such as a town square, theatre and garden,\
  \ interwoven with specialized smaller group homes to give them a more natural environment\
  \ to live in where they can be taken care of. The people involved in this development\
  \ have their focus set on how environment affects gedrag-en stemmingsstoornissen\
  \ (behavior and mood) and with this project they are already seeing a difference\
  \ in their residents, leading better lives than they would in a standard nursing\
  \ home. \n\nBy the time the man had finished his story, the sky had turned a dark\
  \ blue and we had to say goodbye to the man so that we could find our hostel. On\
  \ our way, Tom decided to tell me about how Amsterdam was once commonly referred\
  \ to as Mokum (safe haven, or place in Yiddish) by Jewish people. In the late 15th\
  \ and early 16th century, Sephardic Jews were expulsed from Spain and Portugal during\
  \ the Portuguese Inquisition in 1956 and searched for a place where they could have\
  \ religious freedom. Amsterdam offered them a place to practice religious, social\
  \ and economic autonomy, under the protection of the law. While Tom explained to\
  \ me the use of the word Mokum, I couldn\u2019t help but think of that old man and\
  \ how Amsterdam seemed to be his own Mokum."
