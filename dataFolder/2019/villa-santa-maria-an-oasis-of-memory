Text: "For me, being in Italy feels like being home, the culture, the noise, and the\
  \ food, especially the food is so familiar. So I guess the story starts with my\
  \ brother on the wheel of a small car, with my mom in the passenger seat and a contemplative\
  \ me in the back, admiring the landscapes of Italy\u2019s Abruzzo region. This side\
  \ trip from Rome, developed itself so naturally that none of us refused it. We were\
  \ in Italy just three months after my grandfather had died. And where we were going\
  \ you may ask? A tiny town called Villa Santa Maria, where my grandparents were\
  \ born and lived before they migrated to Mexico. \n\nMy mom hadn\u2019t been there\
  \ in 30 years, I had never been to Villa, even though this was my third time in\
  \ Italy. When I first attempted to visit this ancestral town, everybody told me\
  \ that I would lose my time, since there was nothing there. But now we had a reason\
  \ to go, after my grandfather passed away, in order for my grandmother to get his\
  \ pension money, the government needed an original notarized marriage certificate.\n\
  \nSo we were on the road, going up and down in this mountainous area, when suddenly\
  \ it appeared, the concrete oasis inside the mountain that I had heard in so many\
  \ stories. We parked in front of a hotel that belonged to one of my mother\u2019\
  s uncles, I wondered if in small towns everyone is related. We hesitated, but by\
  \ force of synergy we found ourselves entering the premises, where two old men were\
  \ surprised to see someone going inside after lunch hours. \n\nAfter my mom told\
  \ them who she was, we were instantly seated at a dining area that looked like it\
  \ hadn\u2019t been remodeled since the 70s. We were served dish after dish, because\
  \ in Italy, as we already knew living with my grandmother, if you receive guests,\
  \ it doesn\u2019t matter if they are family, friends, strangers, strange family\
  \ members or even burglars, you give them so much food they won\u2019t be able to\
  \ move after they are finished. \n\n\nThe conversation took weird turns, zio (uncle)\
  \ Euclide and zio Edoardo spoke a combination of Italian and abruzzese, the region\u2019\
  s dialect. There were laughs, tears and mouths full of food that couldn\u2019t get\
  \ any words out. They told us where we could find the Comune where all legal matters\
  \ were treated. So we started walking the steep main street Corso Umberto I. At\
  \ first we saw a ghost town, with nothing open, not a soul in the streets. \n\n\
  As we kept walking, my mother started to remember, and the empty streets became\
  \ alive, the close buildings told us stories. Stories about my grandparents growing\
  \ up, of the life they had before us. Suddenly the gray ambiance was full of color\
  \ and movement and everything made sense, everything was so beautiful to our eyes.\
  \ \n\nNow we had a visual of every story that we had heard, the school where nuns\
  \ educated my grandmother, the church where they got married, the square where they\
  \ used to eat gelato, the cook\u2019s school, pride and joy of the town. We stumbled\
  \ into my grandfather\u2019s old house, now remodeled and with new owners. Almost\
  \ at the top of the hill we found my grandmother\u2019s house in complete ruins.\
  \ So weird to think that they had a life before us. We kept walking, listening as\
  \ my mother remembered the houses of more people related to us in some way or another.\
  \ Every step that I took, I felt like my grandfather was there, so proud of his\
  \ country, of his heritage. We walked for so long that we were hungry again, that\
  \ was a joke, I think I\u2019m still full from that meal. But still, we walked for\
  \ hours, reminiscing on memories that didn\u2019t belong to us, but somehow are\
  \ part of who we are. \n\nWe got back to the small car, with tears in our eyes but\
  \ full hearts. As we hit the highway one more time, we realized we forgot to get\
  \ the marriage certificate, but instead we found this world my grandparents had\
  \ left behind 60 years ago."
