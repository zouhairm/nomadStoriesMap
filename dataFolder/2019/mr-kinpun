Text: "Morning this very bright, I decided for order a taxi to Aung terminal Mingalar\
  \ in the north of Yangon City. Taxi too arrived at the terminal at 10:00 time local\
  \ . After I get the Bus heading Kyaiktyo, bus still should waiting about 30 minutes\
  \ again until the bus is full. After the bus is filled, we too leave the terminal\
  \ heading Kyaiktyo. My goal this time is one of the highlights in Myanmar ''The\
  \ Golden Rock'' or the Myanmar called ''Kyaiktyo\u2019\u2019. It\u2019s well-known\
  \ Buddhist pilgrimage site in Mon State, Burma. It\u2019s a small pagoda with the\
  \ high 7.3 metres built on top of a granite boulder covered with gold leaves pasted\
  \ on by its male devotees. Travel headed Kyaityo eat up time less more than 3 hours.\
  \ \n\nWhen travel headed Kyaikyto, Bus stop at restaurant on the edge Street for\
  \ rest and we take a lunch. The restaurant made from board with low roof so that\
  \ I should rather bow down body for walk in it. Diverse variety of food menus provided\
  \ above the long square table. However no one food was i knew, in part big the bus\
  \ passenger sat and ordered food provided with use Myanmar language, I saw from\
  \ they many who ordered noodles colored white with seasoning (if in Indonesia we\
  \ called it Mie Tiaw ), after saw one one by one food there I decided for eat noodles.\
  \ That\u2019s Not like noodles tiaw Medan, but noodles with texture and weird taste.\
  \ The Sauce colored chocolate as peanuts too feels bland. After ate the food, all\
  \ passenger back to bus for continue the trip. \n\nNot feels three hours already\
  \ passed, after I said \"kyaiktiyo\" Sir, The Driver lower on the edge Street city.\
  \ So down, I didn\u2019t see there is signs Kyaiktyo here, there only lined up shop,\
  \ directly I welcomed by a similar the driver taxibike with vest and hat its distinctive\
  \ color green dingy. I just said to him \" Kyaiktiyo \", and the driver directly\
  \ approached me with the motorbike and brought me to the direction of the destination.\
  \ No worries in myself because I thinking positive that he is a the driver motorcycle\
  \ taxi. \nTen minute already passed, however I didn\u2019t see the signs existence\
  \ of Kyaiktyo. So when I said Kyaktiyo, he would said \"Kinpun, Kinpun \", Incidentally\
  \ I didn\u2019t have the preparation about Kyaiktyo so I didn\u2019t know What is\
  \ ''The Kinpun ''. Three fifty minute we still too is above motorcycle, seen left\
  \ and rigth Street more and more lonely, only there is weeds and land barren, even\
  \ travel more far however signs Kinpun still not yet seen. Four fifty minute passed,\
  \ I asked down from motorbikes and back to point at first that is shop house base\
  \ motorcycle taxi, however he insist that Kinpun already close by. I also hit his\
  \ back signify that I already truly want back only. Debate keep on between us on\
  \ the edge the road, but he promised that I brought to Kinpun not to another place.\
  \ \n\nAfter one hour trip, we started climb Hill and finally we arrived at a village\
  \ that turned out there is some hotels inside. Evidently all hotels and travel here\
  \ offer services travel to Kyaiktyo. After saw around I also relieved, immediately\
  \ I paid handyman motorcycle taxis, which already one hour ride Hill to Kinpun Village.\
  \ I asked, \"how much money I would pay to you?\" The driver taxibike directly waving\
  \ second his hand that he not want paid for. I also replied '' are you sure? '',\
  \ I asked him once more \"please, how much money I would pay to you? Don't be afraid''\
  \ The driver taxibike directly go leave me, I will feel guilty. A motorcycle driver\
  \ that had been I think will kidnap, rob or kill me was not want paid for by tourists\
  \ foreigners. \n\nWhen lie down for a moment I smile and blushed own remembering\
  \ pridiculous that happened this day. A Myanmar citizen who so it's good deliver\
  \ me to hotel I consider someone who intends evil to me. Hopefully I could meet\
  \ hem again with him for acceptable love and ask sorry to him."
