Text: "The sun was high over the western horizon, the air hazy as late afternoon light\
  \ pierced through the drifting dust motes. The black and white ball was badly battered,\
  \ but the boys\u2019 smiles were bright and eager. They held their hands out to\
  \ me, asking me to join their game, and I felt the thrill of fear that only organized\
  \ sports can instill in me.\n\nIt was September of 2018 in Cusco, Peru--and once\
  \ again, I was wandering far off the beaten path. The trip began as the culmination\
  \ of my Spanish major, but it evolved into something so much more. Peru offers a\
  \ vibrant, often-overlooked culture and a wealth of living history. Like the other\
  \ international students, I traveled to the typical, touristy locales, but I knew\
  \ there had to more to the story than what was readily offered up. So one day, after\
  \ classes, I laced up my boots, picked a direction, and started walking. Breaking\
  \ the rules\u2014let\u2019s call them guidelines\u2014the school had laid out for\
  \ me. Again.\n\nPast the city clamor and the last main thoroughfare, there was a\
  \ single lane street winding up the mountainside. The surface was cracked and uneven,\
  \ and there was no shoulder, so I changed over to cement steps nearby. I had no\
  \ particular destination after all\u2014just up. The top of the mountain was still\
  \ a hike away, but I was passing through the last of the residential areas. I was\
  \ less than five kilometers from la Plaza de Armas, where housing has some standards,\
  \ and here these people were suffering from abject poverty. Living in squalor, many\
  \ in houses that lacked roofs. Seeing this, more than anything else in Peru, opened\
  \ my eyes to the truth of the world.\n\nI was crossing through a small, open area\
  \ that looked like a construction zone abandoned years ago when a tattered old football\
  \ (soccer ball to Americans like me) fell from the sky and careened along the cratered\
  \ ground. It rolled to a stop not too far away, at the foot of a raised cement structure\
  \ bordered by a high fence. A boy stood, fingers hooked into the metal wiring, peering\
  \ down at me. \n\n\u201C\xA1Hola!\u201D I called up.\n\n\u201CHola.\u201D\n\nThe\
  \ people and stray dogs clustered around a man frying something ignored me as I\
  \ retrieved the ball and held it up. The sides were ripped and torn almost completely\
  \ free in places, bits of it dangling off. So many feet had kicked it that the thing\
  \ must have been held together more by dreams than stitching. \n\n\u201C\xBFEsta\
  \ pelota es tuya?\u201D Is this ball yours?\n\nHe nodded. \u201C\xA1Tiralo!\u201D\
  \n\n\u201COh, es muy lejos,\u201D I objected. It\u2019s too far. Between the earth\u2019\
  s slope and the fence, I\u2019d have to make it ten meters up.\n\nHe laughed. \u201C\
  \xA1Puedes hacerlo!\u201D You can do it!\n\nI pulled my arm back and whipped the\
  \ ball as hard as I could. As I\u2019d known it would, it fell pitifully short.\
  \ I retrieved it again while the boy laughed. He pointed around the side of the\
  \ enclosure, and I found my way to the entrance. He was standing on a football/soccer\
  \ pitch\u2014the only well-kempt thing around. A group of boys ringed around him.\
  \ I tossed him the ball, but he tossed it right back.\n\n\u201C\xBFQuieres jugar\
  \ conmigo?\u201D\n\nHis invitation to play was sincere, but I knew my ability to\
  \ play football/soccer is even more pathetic than my throwing skills. And yet, I\
  \ couldn\u2019t bring myself to say no. So we played until the sun went down, like\
  \ any group of people anywhere in the world, united under a common cause. And we\
  \ talked\u2014the boys\u2019 grins widening when I said I was American. Despite\
  \ warnings that this part of town was dangerous, they were just out to have fun.\
  \ The world is full of people who simply want to live their lives, and--like seven\
  \ boys with one, destroyed ball--they do their best to make happiness out of the\
  \ little pieces of life they're given.\n\nI couldn\u2019t help but wonder: were\
  \ we visitors told to stick to the main path, not because it\u2019s safer, but because\
  \ the truth of the world\u2014of humanity\u2014is beautiful and terrible, and both\
  \ heartbreaking and astounding to see?"
