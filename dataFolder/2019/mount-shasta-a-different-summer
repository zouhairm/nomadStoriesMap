Text: "It was close to summertime. The holidays were about to start and everyone was\
  \ talking about it. All my friends were planning to go to places like Las Vegas,\
  \ Miami and New York. I like big cities, but by that time my heart wished me to\
  \ go to somewhere else.\n\nSo, what place was that which my heart was expecting\
  \ me to go? It just came out of my mind while I was walking on the mountains, appreciating\
  \ the sunset nearby my home in Tempe, Arizona. Its name was Mount Shasta, a big\
  \ and majestic mountain on the state of California. I had no idea how I would get\
  \ there, but I trust my heart, so I would do it. On the next day I bought a bus\
  \ ticket to Weed, California, the nearest city where the bus would go.\n\nOne hour\
  \ on Tempe\u2019s bus station was enough to get to know some Mexican people and\
  \ eat some tacos with a little Mexican boy that I have no idea what his name is.\
  \ I just know he is about four years old, so adorable and loves eating tacos. He\
  \ ate almost all of the tacos I had bought. That is how the trip began, with feelings\
  \ of joy and friendship.\n\nIt was about six in the morning, when the bus stopped\
  \ at Weed city. From there I took a little bus to the city of Shasta. The bus was\
  \ driven by an incredible woman. She told me everything I should know for camping\
  \ on the mountain. From getting water and food to protecting me from the bears.\
  \ I was lucky for not being found by a bear anyway.\n\nIn Shasta city, I ate a great\
  \ breakfast in a restaurant next to a little market. I bought some food and water\
  \ for the next 2 days. That is the time I had planned to spend on the Mountain.\
  \ Then, after getting some advice from the local forest guard, I was back on the\
  \ road, heading myself to the majestic Mount Shasta.\n\nOn the way to the mountain\
  \ I got a ride with a couple in an old but comfortable car. They were about fifty\
  \ years old. They were going to the mountain to celebrate their wedding anniversary.\
  \ They told me they went there to celebrate their first wedding anniversary many\
  \ years ago and since then they do it every year. When the road ended, the woman\
  \ told me everything I should know to get safely on the camping area.\n\nI spent\
  \ two days and two nights on the mountain. I hiked every trail I could see over\
  \ there. I saw a little deer running on the forest. I saw a little squirrel eating\
  \ some nuts. I met some girls from Guatemala who love talking about spirituality.\
  \ I met a family from Norway. They had two kids who got really excited to know I\
  \ was from Brazil. I still remember their happy faces and bright eyes while they\
  \ were trying to talk to me in English. I met the incredible woman who takes care\
  \ of all the camping area on the mountain. She told me about the secrets of Mount\
  \ Shasta. I met a man who had already been in Brazil. He told me he is a big fan\
  \ of my country. I met an american girl with an unique energy. I can\u2019t remember\
  \ her name, but I do remember her energy. I took showers with a garden water hose.\
  \ And at night, I saw the most incredible sky I have ever seen, full of stars.\n\
  \nThe trip was amazing. I fell in love with that incredible place. And Beyond that,\
  \ I could tell you I did so many trips, not just one. Because each person I got\
  \ to know was like a trip I had made. That is what it means to me to be on the road.\
  \ Open heart.\n\nAfter three days I was back in Tempe with so much energy, bright\
  \ eyes, feelings of love and joy and a sunburned face."
