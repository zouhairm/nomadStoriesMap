Text: "Silent Scream !\n\n\u201CI am sorry I can\u2019t   let you board the plane\u2026\
  \u201D, \n\n \u201CGo to the   police station now!\u201D\u2026.\n\n I was  stunned\
  \  staring  blankly to the airport lady who repeatedly told me that  she can\u2019\
  t let  me board the plane, the most  idiotic moved that I made, as the only thing\
  \ that  matters  to me on  my  first  solo  travel  was my DSLR camera!,  I was\
  \ in a hurry to reach  the busy Dubai airport not knowing  that  my  iqama  ( a\
  \ residence permit issued to those expatriates who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an\
  \ employment visa) was lost!  There\u2019s no  way  that  they  will  let  me board\
  \ the plane, I don\u2019t have the  luxury of  time  to  search for it for I\u2019\
  ve been  to lots of places, taking photos and filming.\n\n I don\u2019t want to\
  \ get stuck in Dubai,  aside from the penalty the trouble that\u2019s awaits me\
  \ for losing my iqama is really insane! I feel that all the  symptoms of impending\
  \ cardiac  arrest with diarrhea hit me right  there in the  middle of the buzzling\
  \  Dubai airport,  my head was spinning!  I got stiff ,I closed my eyes  took  a\
  \ deep  breath  meditating  for a minute, I went  straight  to the corner of  rest\
  \ room , slumped  on the floor while dismantling my  luggage searching for my iqama\
  \ ,tears started to fall but I told myself (no ,don\u2019t cry ! get   up  and try\
  \ your best to talk to the manager) I dried my tears freshen  up and smile at the\
  \ lady on the mirror facing me, \u201CHey beautiful lady,  smile! you can do it!\u201D\
  .\n\nWe ran  at  top  speed with the security on my left  and  the aviation  manager\
  \  on  my right ,  causing  a commotion at  the  airport , as we raced  through\
  \  the  security boarding  gate causing  the delay of the flight.\n\n As I landed,\
  \ the adrenaline rush was still high, I hastily headed to Gudauri , the ski resort\
  \  2200 meters above sea level, south facing plateau of the greater Caucasus mountain\
  \ range in Georgia, which is 2 hours\u2019 drive from the airport, transported \
  \ with a local  taxi driver who don\u2019t speak  English but  rather speak Spanish\
  \ (he worked in Madrid for years).\n\nThe 300 years colonization  of the Spaniards\
  \ in the Philippines save  my  ass,  while an enchanting Georgian  music is playing\
  \ realization struck me that  life is so damn amazing! I didn\u2019t  sleep  even\
  \  if  my eyes is dropping dead I talk to him using my innate skills from my Spanish\
  \ ancestors and told him to change the music to Georgian party music because our\
  \ car seems drunk while he drive since he feel sleepy on that early morning drive.\
  \ It\u2019s 08:30 am still I can\u2019t barely see the  shadow of the sun, but \
  \ I almost see the civilization as we climbed the steep road, I was freezing i don't\
  \ want to get out  of the car , wearing only  a red leather  jacket, a jeans and\
  \ high cut converse, a real ignorant lady, embracing my  first snow experience\u2026\
  \n\nAn impulsive Asian lady who was invited to attend   an event in Courchevel,\
  \ but visa was refused. Rejection  won\u2019t  stop me, so I  booked an  impromptu\
  \  flight to Dubai-Georgia, a  first time  solo traveler, searching for her lost\
  \ self, afraid of the dark , ghost or spirits of the  unknown (a coward bitch haha)\
  \ has travel sickness who throw up like a drunk alcoholic, trying all the crazy\
  \  things I\u2019ve never done before,( my first time to visit a bar, got drunk\
  \ with the sweetest wine with a coke as a chaser few hours before heading back to\
  \ airport  (Dubai-Riyadh) you can\u2019t say that you\u2019ve been to  Georgia if\
  \ you don\u2019t  taste their wine, known as the oldest  wine regions in the world!\
  \ \n\nLife\u2019s lesson learned, If you don\u2019t ask, the answer is always No!\
  \ trying  your  best  is  better  than  not   trying  at all  , the adventure that\
  \ we experience is not  a new place that  we find , but a piece of ourselves that\
  \ we will never lose! \n\nI almost wasted my life due to depression, but embracing\
  \ all my fears, leaping to the unknown, it\u2019s a liberating experience!"
