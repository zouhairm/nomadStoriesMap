Text: "A Trip with the Goddess of Love\n\nThe Greco-Roman mythology is by all means\
  \ no place to look for love life inspiration. The king of the gods is Zeus, the\
  \ god of thunder. He had a lot of extra-marital affairs and ended up breeding heroes\
  \ of the mythology. There\u2019s also Poseidon, who picked a wrong place to date\
  \ a woman. His girlfriend, Medusa, was then cursed to possess hair of snake. And\
  \ don\u2019t forget Hades who kidnapped his dream girl so that he could marry her.\n\
  Perhaps the gods really had a hard time with their love lives. And thus needed a\
  \ deity who devoted her life for love and all the problems it brought. Long live\
  \ Venus!\n\nThe Golden Age of the Greco-Roman mythology might now be long gone.\
  \ But the goddess of love is still watching from above as if standing by to help\
  \ those desperate lovers. We can find her shimmering brightly after sunset and before\
  \ the sunrise. As a planet, she would looked glittered like a star, but would be\
  \ the shiniest of them all. Just like her beauty used to attract all the gods and\
  \ heroes of the mythology.   \n\nAs shining as she may be, finding her is no easy\
  \ task. As an amateur star-gazer, I spent quite a time to observe the sky when it\
  \ was clear. Starry night was sure amazing but I could never really tell which \u201C\
  star\u201D was Venus. Till the day I ride the motorbike under the moonlight of Kenting,\
  \ Taiwan. \n\nI was visiting Kenting with my friends for a weekend getaway. That\
  \ morning, we were going for a sunrise trip. When we left our motel, the sky was\
  \ still dark. The morning wind blew mildly but enough to send chill to my skin.\
  \ We wore jackets, put on helmets, and off we go.\n\nWe were a bit too late. The\
  \ sound of our bike\u2019s engine broke the silence in that dawn. We rode as fast\
  \ as we could. But the light had started to lit in the east. \n\n\u201CWe can still\
  \ make it to the spot before the sunrise end.\u201D I hoped in faint.  \n\nAs my\
  \ vision grew more and more clearly due to the light, I sighed by myself:\n\u201C\
  Ah, we should have wake up earlier...\u201D  \n\nSuddenly, clinging right beside\
  \ the crescent, Venus smiled upon me.\n\nI was struck. \n\n\u201CIs that her? The\
  \ daughter of Zeus and the wife of Hephaestus?\u201D I thought by myself. \n\nI\
  \ took a deeper glance. No doubt, it\u2019s her. Even without any dark background\
  \ around her, she still shone twice or thrice as bright as the other stars, which\
  \ look timid around her beauty. They indeed were opening up the way for the princess\
  \ of Olympus. \n\nThe sunrise trip was indeed a failure. \u201CWe wouldn\u2019t\
  \ get any good picture once we arrived at the hill.\u201D I thought. \n\nYet, riding\
  \ on the motorbike, I had not even a tiny amount of regret. \n\nI gazed at the tranquil\
  \ road ahead of me. Heard the rolling waves not far away. Stared at the blue sky\
  \ above me. Smelled the freshness of the surrounding air. And last but not least,\
  \ having Her Majesty shone bright upon me. What more can I ask?\n\nI lifted up my\
  \ head and glanced at the horizon. I felt content. No excitement like when you suddenly\
  \ meet Rafael Nadal or Lebron James in the street. No euphoric burst of happiness\
  \ as when you win the lottery. Just content. Like when you sip your tea while finishing\
  \ a good book. \n\nAnd I think that\u2019s the whole point of travelling. To be\
  \ content. The main goal is never to visit all the instagrammable spots in the world.\
  \ You\u2019ll ended up wearing up yourself by doing just that. Instead, you aim\
  \ for moments which could be either planned or unplanned, nevertheless, giving you\
  \ the simplest sense of gratefulness for existing in the world and whilst able to\
  \ experience those moments.  \n\nFor my part, that moment came unplanned. I wasn\u2019\
  t expecting any of it that morning. But maybe this is what the goddess of love really\
  \ do. Sharing love, joy and happiness to all creatures of this world. Looking forward\
  \ for my next weekend getaway!\n\n-SA-"
