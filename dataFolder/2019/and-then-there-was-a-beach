Text: "The trip to Barcelona was an afterthought. \n\nWIth the tickets bought separetely,\
  \ my friend and I ended up arriving in Europe on different dates and countries,\
  \ so I had a few days before meeting her in London. Barcelona was relatively close\
  \ to Lisbon - where my flight from Brazil would arrive -, and so I decided to stay\
  \ there for a couple of nights. \n\nOn the way to Las Ramblas, where the hostel\
  \ was, I could already feel that it was even warmer than Lisbon, and that the people\
  \ in the city were really enjoying it: almost midnight, and I could hear the sounds\
  \ and see the sangria jugs on the pubs and bars nearby. \n\nThe first day was Gothic\
  \ Quarter day. Pretty much all that I knew about Barcelona was related to it, and\
  \ I had a great time walking around the narrow streets packed with people with selfie\
  \ sticks, even if it was about a million degrees. The grayish and brownish stones\
  \ that were used on the buildings gave the walk a feeling of having just stepped\
  \ into a movie or gotten inside a book about ancient History. Each corner held a\
  \ little church or museum, that was just as fascinating on the inside as it was\
  \ on the outside. \n\nThe second - and last - day started as per the advice of my\
  \ hostel roomate (a girl about my age, who lived in Switzerland): a visit  to the\
  \ stone cross at Park G\xFCell, that she told me was a nice high point to look at\
  \ the city. Took the subway, and the escalators in the middle of the street to get\
  \ to the top of a huge hill, and she was right, the view was ridiculously beautiful.\
  \ The most amazing thing, though, wasn't the the city itself, but what we could\
  \ see on the other side: Park G\xFCell. \n\nAs I said before, Barcelona wasn't really\
  \ on my plans \u2013 it was more of a pre-trip -, so I didn't really know anything\
  \ about it and its attractions. Needless to say, then, that Park G\xFCell was an\
  \ amazing surprise. The unique architecture, the beautiful gardens, the musicians\
  \ playing different songs on each little nook of the stone: everything put together\
  \ one of the most amazing things I had ever seen. The colors, the tiles, the shapes\
  \ of the constructions: evething is so very unique and, combined, the elements create\
  \ a dream-like place - something almost out of Wonderland. \n\nAs much as I loved\
  \ the Park, my visit to the city was a very short one, and I had to at least go\
  \ crane my neck up high to see the Sagrada Familia Cathedral up close. Eating a\
  \ greese slice of pizza from a corner shop, I walked there in half an hour, but\
  \ the line at the entrance \u2013 and the official website \u2013 told me that I\
  \ wouldn't be able to get inside. The exterior was still stunning, though. It was\
  \ probably one of the tallest buildings I've ever seen upclose, and not even the\
  \ construction equipment - a permanent fixture - took away the feeling of being\
  \ before one of the most iconic and majestic places in the world. \n\nFrom there,\
  \ I decided to walk back, not really looking at a route or anything, and the streets,\
  \ full on a sunday afternoon with people walking their dogs or enjoying the nice\
  \ weather, were very pedestrian-friendly, with big sidewalks and benches along the\
  \ way, where you could rest up for a few minutes, while enjoying some of the summer\
  \ fruit being sold on the street. \n\nThe unpretentious walk led to the best bonus\
  \ I could ever find: the beach! With so many beautiful attractions, I had competely\
  \ forgotten that the Mediterranean Sea was right there. It's almost unfair for a\
  \ single city to have it all.\n\nI stayed there for some time, holding my shoes\
  \ in hand and feeling the waves at my feet, and walked back to the hostel to go\
  \ to the airport. \n\nIt sounds really trivial: a beach that wasn't even nearly\
  \ as beautiful as the ones in my home country, but the experience of finding it\
  \ unexpectedly made it the most beautiful place on Earth. Barcelona is amazing."
