Text: "Few years ago, and if I should be precise, it happened in the summer of 2016,\
  \ I accidentally said yes. A strange beginning of a story,isn't it? Lets have a\
  \ look over it. \n I had the great opportunity to become part of the big family\
  \ which Erasmus + is offering us,so I did! I accidentally applied for a project\
  \ in Hungary where the main goal was to achieve our main aims by using different\
  \ types of media. Still it is rather an ordinary story,I know. I will start from\
  \ the very beginning! It was my first going to the capital of Bulgaria - Sofia,my\
  \ first touch to an airport,my very first flight,and the first time I felt kind\
  \ of alone.\n To begin with I had troubles on the airport. They thought I was some\
  \ kind of terrorist because of my black suitcase. Of course I was so damn into the\
  \ panic and I thought that I am going to die because of all the obstacles I will\
  \ have to face! A few hours later the Bulgarian team gathered up at the meeting\
  \ point,so we took the flight,arrived at Budapest and went to our hostel! We were\
  \ in Budapest 2 days before the project started. It was nice,the project started\
  \ and one week was already over! When the final destination of the project reached\
  \ its limits! We were separated in teams of 5 (there were 9 countries at total participating\
  \ in the project). We had to survive in wild Hungary only by ourselves! They allowed\
  \ us to take only a bottle of water and a vest! So we were rather feeling votive\
  \ than safe. The first day my team and me traveled by foot more than 25 km. Finally\
  \ we went to one small village where we found the mayor and in the most broken Hungarian\
  \ language and a lot of body language we tried to explain her our situation and\
  \ to ask her for an accommodation! She found us something and even though she brought\
  \ us pizza! We were so thankful to her. On the following day we had to travel again...this\
  \ time we did it with hitchhiking because we had to go on about 70 km away from\
  \ where we were at this certain moment! After 2 hours of desperate tries we started\
  \ walking by foot! A few moments later a car stopped and offered us to take us to\
  \ the place we had to go! So out of nowhere! We reached the point so we had to find\
  \ out where to sleep. We saw that there was a camp with some type of circus so we\
  \ told them the exact sentence - \"We offer help for food and a tent!\". They were\
  \ really surprised but they accepted our offer and they did helped us! They gave\
  \ us a tent and even though at the end of the day they bought us pizza,so kind of\
  \ them! The following morning we asked them can they take us with their car to the\
  \ main point where the project was taken because that was the last day of the \"\
  challenge\"! They did took us there and so in return we offered them to wait for\
  \ 10 minutes so we can go to the main department where the project was taken and\
  \ we can give them something! They did waited for us so we gave them a painting\
  \ which our team created before we left the building for the challenge! In the very\
  \ end we were safe,back to the place we begun from and kind of happy to be back\
  \ in the civilization! \n That is my story! A little bit peculiar,a little bit adventurous\
  \ but really,really experiencing ourself! If I had the opportunity to do it again\
  \ now,I would do it for sure,because it just needs one \"YES\" in order to create\
  \ memories!"
