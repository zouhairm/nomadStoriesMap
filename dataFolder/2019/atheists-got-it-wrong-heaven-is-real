Text: "From getting diagnosed with Stendhal Syndrome and witnessing a living proof\
  \ beauty and elegance can co-exist with \"il dolce far niente,\" to finding the\
  \ definition of peace of mind whilst taking a stroll down a small medieval town,\
  \ and falling in love in love ancient history as you sip red wine whilst my eyes\
  \ gaze upon the many little villages, castles, abbeys and hamlets... Tuscany: the\
  \ untold story of real-life heaven.\n\nIn Florence; the capital of Tuscany separated\
  \ into two by the River Arno that flows from the Apennines through Florence and\
  \ Pisa and on to the Ligurian Sea, exists the world's prettiest panoramic view.\
  \ All you need is hike up to Michaelangelo where you get to see the sun sinking\
  \ down,\_drowning on pink and purple floods, in an overwhelming tides of color that\
  \ make all the sharp\_lines dim and faint and turn the solid city to a city of dreams,\
  \ after overdosing on art the Uffizi Gallery, L'Accademia, Pitti Palace with its\
  \ magnificent Boboli Gardens, where you get to follow Professor Langdon's footsteps\
  \ and create your very own Inferno experience, have to offer.\n\nIn the morning,\
  \ take a train to Piggibonsi, and hop on a bus afterwards all the way to San Gimignano.\
  \ Behind the ancient walls of such a spectacular medieval town lies beauty at its\
  \ finest... Having been to the Instagrammable Duomo di Firenze, you would most probably\
  \ think you would never be into a Cathedral that pretty; however, San Gimignano\
  \ is well-known for proving people wrong. You wouldn't be the first to, when you\
  \ walk into its Collegiate Church, where to the end of the hall lies the virgin,\
  \ where faith and art intertwine, bringing together believers, dreamers and thinkers.\
  \ And, given the addiction to beauty you would have developed in Florence, your\
  \ body would be craving its drug... Perfection, and San Gimignano does have the\
  \ world's best dealer; the top of Torre Grosse. Move now? Nope... Tuscan food is\
  \ a must-try; from braised pork with plums, along with Tuscan  red wine, following\
  \ an assorted fine selection of Tuscan cold meats that without any cogitation tops\
  \ Spain's famousbJamon de Bellota, and sheep's and goat's milk cheeses that is miles\
  \ ahead -in terms of taste and texture- of Swiss and French cheese served with honey\
  \ and jam, is only a start, for you can't leave San Gimignano without having a Cantucci\
  \ e Vin Santo; an alcohol lover's heavenly dessert,\_given the crazy balance between\
  \ delicacy and  intensity such a strong, full-bodied, sweet dessert wine with aromas\_\
  of\_hazelnut, caramel, honey, tropical fruit, perfume and dried apricot has to offer\
  \ when served along with the authentic Tuscan almond biscotti that brings heaven\
  \ to your mouth upon the first bite, ex-post being dipped in Vin Santo.\n\nNow,\
  \ you can move... Between the land of Brunello to that of Nobile, your heart will\
  \ get torn between Montalcino, the closest town to Val D'Orcia, with its gentle,\
  \ cultivated hills occasionally broken by gullies and by picturesque towns and villages\
  \ where you must pay at least a single Brunello winery a visit, and Montepulciano\
  \ -home to Twilight New Moon... Yes, you got it right, fanatic. You get to recreate\
  \ the scene where Bella, rushed through the entrance of Palazzo Comune across Piazza\
  \ Grande to save your Edward from committing suicide. But, no, don't take it that\
  \ far. You don't want to risk your acting partner's life cause you both would certainly\
  \ fall in love with the town that you would forget it's only acting... And, trust\
  \ me, your boyfriend wouldn't wanna die whilst craving more beauty. Magical Pisa,\
  \ well-known for its leaning tower that lies right next to one of the world's prettiest\
  \ cathedrals, will ensure satisfying your cravings, but if you truly want to get\
  \ to the full satiation point, you need to devote time for Lucca... Starting from\
  \ the trace of the Roman amphiteater overlooking Piazza dell'Anfiteatro to the archeological\
  \ remains of the 12th century church of Saints Giovanni and Reparata and the 16th\
  \ century towers, you would make that one mistake you made and promised never to\
  \ repeat; that being falling in love.\n\nCongratulations, Julia Roberts shall be\
  \ jealous of your personal, authenticity-packed Eat, Pray, Love experience."
