Text: "Travelling has a different inference for people on various levels. One such\
  \ experience was my trip to Ranikhet, which is sixty kilometres farther from Nainital,\
  \ India.\n\nTravelling is more of an idea to find peace from a life in the city,\
  \ a near escape. Nevertheless, I found my reasons to travel be a little different\
  \ this time.\n\nI wanted to experience Soul searching without even knowing the meaning\
  \ of it all. I wanted to find solace through the big words for I was too na\xEF\
  ve to get it right. Still, it was worth a try to explore the pages of my life which\
  \ were left unturned. Maybe, I could find what I was looking for or face the dilemmas\
  \ I always found myself running away from.\n\nThe first day of the trip was a usual\
  \ cry for help in my mind. I wanted to escape the feelings that made me feel trapped\
  \ but I realised I was trying too hard. I thought about things I wanted to do or\
  \ the \u201Cwhat-ifs\u201D. All this never made me calm and looked nothing like\
  \ I planned.\n\nThe next day, it felt different. I could feel the cold air of the\
  \ place getting through me while I was walking in the narrow lanes of the city.\
  \ I got excited about what lies ahead of me. I was content with the life I was living,\
  \ what I had accomplished. I wasn\u2019t thinking of the future but I wasn\u2019\
  t whining about the past either.\n\nSometimes, a few things strike a chord and embed\
  \ deep into our minds. It\u2019s funny how books can make you do a complete reversal\
  \ on the things that were once sacred to your heart and you thought to be true.\
  \ This happened to me when I was reading a book. It had a simple thought that went\
  \ like this and I quote,\n\n\u201CDid any Samana or Brahman ever fear, someone might\
  \ come and grab him and steal his learning, and his religious devotion, and his\
  \ depth of thought? No, for they are his very own, and he would only give and to\
  \ whomever, he is willing to give.\u201D\n\nThese lines were heart-wrenching. We\
  \ have all had our hearts broken or felt hurt due to some reason. But, these lines\
  \ made a complete opposite perception of how I used to think. What we have acquired,\
  \ or whatever love we have for others can\u2019t be taken away if we never wished\
  \ them to have. Those people were living in a false feeling of accomplishment because\
  \ if we never gave anything, they never had it in the first place.\n\nThis gave\
  \ me an instant redemption from the regrets I ever had. I felt serenity, I believe.\n\
  I felt so energised by my emotional upliftment that I wanted to channelize my thoughts\
  \ into something even bigger. Afterwards, I went to Chaubatia Gardens where you\
  \ would find huge orchards laden with juicy fruits like peaches, apples, apricots\
  \ and much more. It is a beautiful view. The gardener gave us an insight into how\
  \ they predict a rainfall by pointing out to a plant that how it looks dry and that\
  \ means, it is going to rain tomorrow. At first, it seemed like a trivial thought\
  \ and I didn\u2019t pay much attention to it. The next day it started raining and\
  \ I recalled a line from a book called as The Secret by Rhonda Byrne that you get\
  \ what you attract. Suddenly, many things started to make sense and a strange motivation\
  \ to do things differently in my mind crept in.\n\nWe find happiness from the escape\
  \ to the problems we planted. I found happiness by a connection to my own self a\
  \ lot more than before. Which is why I was able to connect with the love from people\
  \ close to my heart. Not only did I understand the affection, but also was I able\
  \ to give back much more. I felt content and serene.\n\nI still don\u2019t know\
  \ if that\u2019s what they mean by soul searching or finding yourself. If all of\
  \ this will matter for that I am too na\xEFve to understand.\nHowever, if given\
  \ a chance, I would do it all over again."
