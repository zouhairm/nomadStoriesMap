  \ tell you what my background is, i am javanese and my friend is half chinese.\n\
  First day in hong kong, i was excited to travel around. And second day i look around\
  \ that they deserve me different than my friend.\nwhen i saw that they give her\
  \ some paper for rent but me....not. I repeat again maybe three times, and i got\
  \ tired so i just sit and look them carefully because i dont know why. \nAt least\
  \ 30 minutes and i know why, because i\u2019m different, they think that i am labour\
  \ because is too much people there as a worker (low price) \nAnd i tell my friend,\u201D\
  \ sit and look\u201D, i will give you some experience of life that when you are\
  \ different from the highest people in there you will be stranger. So if you want\
  \ to be them you need to be them.\n\nAnd my friend answer it,\u201Dso, why dont\
  \ you to be them?\u201D\n\u201CI can\u2019t because my body can\u2019t change like\
  \ money did\u201D\nWe\u2019ve learn something for life that if we were different\
  \ or we were highest commodity in some place we dont need to do like that. We just\
  \ deserve all people as same as we did before"
