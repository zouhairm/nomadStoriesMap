Text: "I remember feeling so much pride for the homeland I had left behind in the\
  \ months of the Euromaidan protests. I had actively kept up with the news, gawking\
  \ in horror at photos of ordinary citizens camped out in Independence Square in\
  \ the cold of Ukrainian winter. I identified with them, I was rooting for them.\
  \ I couldn\u2019t accept that the savage warfare that I was so used to seeing in\
  \ third-world countries was now happening in my birthplace. I fervently corrected\
  \ people when they labeled me as \u2018Russian,\u2019 insisting on a distinction\
  \ I couldn\u2019t fully defend or explain. I even participated in a local protest\
  \ with my parents, showing our support from the other side of the world through\
  \ signs that read, \u201CPutin, let my people go!\u201D \n\nIn 2018, I was ready\
  \ to go back. I was curious to see how much the country had changed, knowing how\
  \ much I had changed since my last visit. I also wanted to see my grandma for what\
  \ I felt would be the last time; Alzheimer\u2019s was consuming what was left of\
  \ her day after day. \n\nThe tears couldn\u2019t help but well up in my eyes as\
  \ soon as I saw her. She was small and unmoving, curled up in an armchair with a\
  \ blanket covering her frail body when I entered. She had lost all ability to care\
  \ of herself, and was now looked after by two full-time nurses. I crouched at her\
  \ armchair in the room where I had spent so many hours doing puzzles and playing\
  \ checkers with her as a kid. The room itself hadn\u2019t changed one bit, with\
  \ the exception of the permanent, padded bed that was now there to accommodate my\
  \ grandma\u2019s limited mobility. She now lived and spent her days in that room.\
  \ I saw the progression of my childhood in a series of dusty photos behind the glass\
  \ of her cupboard, sent courtesy of my parents after our move to America. Me in\
  \ Disneyland, me in a witch costume on Halloween, me ice skating, me at school.\
  \ This was how my grandma watched me grow up. \n\nI wondered what my \u2018babushka\u2019\
  \ would think of the mess that had become her home country if she were truly present.\
  \ The Alzheimer\u2019s had been eating away at her since the start of the conflict,\
  \ and I wondered if she ever had the chance to form an opinion about what was happening.\
  \ I wondered what side she would take, or if she would even take a side at all.\
  \ Would she feel the undying patriotism shared by so many Western Ukrainian citizens,\
  \ or would she express an allegiance to Russia? Or would she just want a sense of\
  \ peace, and be indifferent to its source? I wondered if she would feel the fear\
  \ and uncertainty, perhaps the only factor unifying citizens over the years, or\
  \ if she would feel any semblance of hope. Part of me hoped that she never had to\
  \ ponder these thoughts in the first place.\n\nI took my grandma\u2019s hand, and\
  \ told her that her \u201COlychka,\u201D the endearing name she used for me when\
  \ I was a child, had come to see her. Her blue eyes stared at me blankly, as if\
  \ any remnants of her were buried so deep that it would be impossible to reach them.\
  \ She didn\u2019t take her eyes off of me, as I attempted to summarize the highlights\
  \ of the last five years of my life. I told her about my adventures, my love of\
  \ travel, and how it felt to be back in my first home. \n\nAfter a while, I noticed\
  \ the forced semblance of a smile on her lips, as if she was using all of the mental\
  \ energy that she had left to convey to me that she was listening. And that she\
  \ desperately wanted to hold on to this moment, to this memory. Nothing else mattered.\
  \ Except that her Olychka had returned home."
