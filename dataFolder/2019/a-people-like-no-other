Text: "It\u2019s 5am on a typical Wednesday in the Costa Rican capital. I\u2019m walking\
  \ briskly through empty streets toward the international bus station. I\u2019m a\
  \ few minutes late but I resist running since I'm still recovering from 3 torn ligaments\
  \ in my left ankle and I\u2019m carrying a 65 liter backpack. I spent the previous\
  \ month resting my foot in Puerto Viejo, a laid back surfing town on the Caribbean\
  \ coast. Fortunately, I was traveling with two friends who helped carry me and my\
  \ belongings around when my ankle collapsed. Yet, here I am alone, limping onto\
  \ a bus that will drive me over 10 hours into the poorest and, perhaps, least touristy\
  \ country in Central America. \n\nI had never been to Nicaragua before. I couldn\u2019\
  t speak Spanish, nor did I know anything about the culture I was about to enter.\
  \ This coupled with my injury left my friends concerned. To be honest, I was a bit\
  \ hesitant. But I felt compelled to embark on this adventure. To live in a foreign\
  \ country on my own. To embrace a new culture and language. To take a leap into\
  \ the unknown. \n\nLittle did I know that I was about to enter a country whose people\
  \ and culture would capture my heart like no other. I certainly didn\u2019t expect\
  \ to be conversing in Spanish within 6 weeks. And who could have guessed that the\
  \ safest and most promising country in Central America would erupt into violent\
  \ chaos shortly after my arrival. \n\nHowever, from the moment I crossed the border,\
  \ it was obvious my world was about to change. I saw a country whose military ran\
  \ checkpoints like counselors in summer camp. I took local transport in the form\
  \ of old yellow school buses that weren\u2019t good enough for American school children\
  \ but were transporting up to 100 Nicaraguans consisting of men, women, children,\
  \ their groceries and chickens. The roads weren\u2019t paved, the houses were often\
  \ no sturdier than an amateur chicken coop, and those living in rural areas had\
  \ to commute several hours for work or health care. Yet these people had the widest\
  \ and purest smiles I ever encountered. \n\nThey, who had every reason to complain\
  \ or be jealous of a privileged American, treated me like one of their own. Some\
  \ locals invited me to play baseball with them and then introduced me to their families.\
  \ One woman insisted on doing my laundry - even though I tried explaining that I\
  \ enjoyed washing my own clothes. A boy, who I befriended on the beach earlier that\
  \ day, helped me navigate the city of Leon while it was under siege by pro-government\
  \ militias. \n\nI learned a lot during my 6 week stay in Nicaragua. I learned how\
  \ to dance salsa, deep-sea fish, surf a volcano, evade roadblocks, drink tequila,\
  \ etc. More importantly, I learned what it\u2019s like to travel alone and out of\
  \ my comfort zone. I lived in a straw hut, stood for hours like a sardine on the\
  \ chicken bus, and walked countless miles when anti-government protesters closed\
  \ off the main roads. And I certainly learned how not to ride a horse. \n\nPerhaps\
  \ most importantly, I learned how to give without expecting anything in return.\
  \ I was born and raised in New York, the capital of a capitalist society. I was\
  \ taught to be reserved, emotionally and financially. And there I was, in a country\
  \ where the average wage is $4 a day, yet people opened their hearts and houses\
  \ for me without worry for their well-being or the future of their savings. This\
  \ taught me more than anything the value of an authentic experience and the invaluableness\
  \ of a genuine relationship, regardless of race or finances.\n\nSince this experience,\
  \ I\u2019ve been to 10 other countries in the Americas, Europe, and the Middle East.\
  \ I experienced similar kindness and openheartedness in the few days I spent in\
  \ the Sinai Desert. However, deeply ingrained in my heart is the smiles and triumphant\
  \ spirit of the people of Nicaragua who chose to befriend me, a curious and wanderlust\
  \ traveler, while they chose to fight their own president, an iniquitous dictator."
