Text: "It's 2:30 am and I wake up, still half asleep I put my clothes on, I make my\
  \ hairstyle and put a coat on, ready to take a quick breakfast while I'm calling\
  \ the Uber; it's 3:00 am and I'm walking out the door to my uber, expecting nothing\
  \ but everything about this day, we arrived at the bus and I settle in my seat,\
  \ I know we have a few hours 'till we arrive so I fall asleep. \nI wake up at 9:00\
  \ am and we've arrived at the destination, the coordinator of the group tells us\
  \ the time we\xB4re supposed to meet everyone at the gathering point, 2:00 pm, seems\
  \ like a good hour; he also lets us know that we can hike the mountain or use trucks\
  \ to arrive, my partner and I decided to go walking all the way to the top. \nWe\
  \ began walking and we realize it isn't as cold as we expected, actually is really\
  \ warm, so I remove my coat, my sweatshirt and now I'm only in my sweater, we keep\
  \ walking and taking pictures of the beautiful landscape, we arrive at the harbor\
  \ of the mountain, we read the rules and keep walking, there's a lot of dust, and\
  \ we see many trucks with at least 15 people on them going up and down the path,\
  \ we see a sign we've got 8 km left to go, I ask him if he wants to keep walking\
  \ he says yes, after a while of walking and talking we make a stop to eat some previously\
  \ made mini paninis we eat two, I fix my boots while he pees in a tree, we keep\
  \ walking while we eat a little bit of chocolate, as we walk we notice a couple\
  \ of horses and next to them there are little paths on the mountain that we can\
  \ use to get faster, we take one, it's harder to walk on them but it's more satisfying,\
  \ we see some cyclist on the road and I offer them a couple of oranges, we keep\
  \ walking, and I feel the urge of peeing, I've never peed in the woods, I find a\
  \ tree that seems perfect, I put down my pants and do it, I feel better, we keep\
  \ walking, I don't see snow, or cars anymore, anyway we still go uphill, we see\
  \ a cow on the road, nex thing I know we are at the top, the view is amazing, after\
  \ a while we check the hour 1:30 pm we sit at a rock and eat the rest of the chocolate\
  \ and paninis, we decide is time to go back, so we start walking and I feel the\
  \ urge of pooping, my partner shows me a tree, I walk with fear towards it, I grab\
  \ the tree with one hand and I squat, it comes out, and I feel somehow free, as\
  \ if I was in contact with my most animal self.\n We start going downhill, after\
  \ two hours we decide to go through a path, but at half of the path we see a cliff,\
  \ it's not what we were expecting, we started freaking out, and at that moment we\
  \ heard a voice: \"Hey you guys got lost too?\" It's a cyclist and we go uphill\
  \ again with him, we chat for a while until we find the road. \nIt's getting dark,\
  \ 4:30 pm and we haven't arrived, we don't even have signal, we keep walking, all\
  \ the trucks are full and no one wants to pick us up, I'm exhausted, but I keep\
  \ walking, we stop a taxi driver and he says we need to keep walking for twenty\
  \ minutes, I feel my feet sore and with blisters, I feel the blisters explode as\
  \ I walk, I don't think I can do this anymore. \n\"Sing,\" my partner says, I do\
  \ so, I sing some Lana del Rey song until we arrived at the harbor, there are missing\
  \ people in our group, so we wait there another hour, I'm exhausted, we walk down\
  \ to the bus, when we arrive I go back to our seats, close my eyes and sleep."
