Text: "Cabbies the world over seem to have a moral compass that isn\u2019t easily\
  \ swayed by their surroundings. This was the first thought I had as I wheeled my\
  \ suitcase through the turnstiles of the railway terminal in Makkah, only to be\
  \ absorbed by a gaggle of drivers all angling to transport my family  to our hotel.\
  \ Even in our limited interactions in Saudia Arabia, I knew that the rates they\
  \ demanded were extortionate. I smiled, realising that we may well be in the Holiest\
  \ Land for Muslims but the everyday business of life must go on.\n      In some\
  \ ways, I had expected our pilgrimage thus far to be different. I had envisioned\
  \ our train carriage to reverberate with the impassioned chants of Labbayk-Allaahumma-Labbayk\
  \ (the first verbal declaration of every Umrah-goer), from Madinah to Makkah. Instead,\
  \ I found myself distracted by the chatter of a group of teenage boys huddled over\
  \ a phone playing a video game. This was a far cry from my grandmother\u2019s stories\
  \ of people giving up their life\u2019s earnings to pay their respects at the House\
  \ of Allah or \u201CBait ul Allah\u201D as our Egyptian driver now reminded us before\
  \ breaking into a surprisingly soulful rendition of a religious song. \n      Nothing\
  \ in life prepares you for the humbling grandeur of Makkah, a fact that hit me the\
  \ minute I set foot into The Great Mosque, which surrounds the Kaabah. People who\
  \ turn to religion late in life are known to possess a somewhat poetic disposition.\
  \ My \u201Cawakening\u201D came calling a month shy of my thirtieth birthday.\n\
  \      As human beings, we seek personal connections to every journey undertaken.\
  \ My first sighting of the Kaabah, however, stripped me of every sense of self.\
  \ Circumambulating it, I realised that the emotional outburst I had anticipated\
  \ on being confronted by this ivory tower towards which we prostrated five times\
  \ a day pinning our dreams, disappointments and pleas for forgiveness, was instead\
  \ replaced by awe for the invisible thread that binds worshippers across the world.\
  \ As we walked shoulder to shoulder \u2013 the able-bodied alongside those gnarled\
  \ and weathered by the storms of life, only made less remarkable by the crippled,\
  \ who steered themselves on contraptions resembling skateboards \u2013 I found myself\
  \ understanding the magnitude of the word Subhanallah. \n      Close to midnight,\
  \ a lock of hair was cut, symbolising the completion of our Umrah. We stepped out\
  \ of the mosque only to be accosted by little vendors with exquisitely embroidered\
  \ bags and beseeching eyes who pleaded with an eagerness that seemed to want to\
  \ lure us back into worldly affairs. \u201CAunty, aunty, please. Ten riyals only.\u201D\
  \ \n                                                                           \
  \                                                    ******\nWaking up for the dawn\
  \ prayers had, to date, proven to be the chink in my spiritual armour but in Makkah\
  \ I was a reformed woman.  On our last morning, we completed our prayers and made\
  \ the trek for the \u201Cfarewell Tawwaf\u201D around the Kaabah.\n      \u201C\
  Stick together at all costs\u201D, was the message that had been drummed into our\
  \ heads by my father. Unlike every other pilgrim, who would try to get as close\
  \ to the Kaabah as possible in an attempt to kiss the sacred black stone set into\
  \ its eastern corner, we had been instructed to navigate the outermost circles.\
  \ \n      On reaching the point that signalled the completion of our third round,\
  \ I recited the Shahada. As I declared the words asserting my belief in the Oneness\
  \ of Allah and acceptance of Muhammad as His Messenger, tears streamed freely down\
  \ my face. Looking up, I realised that we had been swept into the innermost circle.\
  \ Weeping, I tugged at my father. \u201CWe\u2019re here, we can touch the Kaabah.\u201D\
  \ Without turning back, I took a step forward and the throngs seemed to part for\
  \ me.\n      We had been told on our first day by our religious guide to not, in\
  \ a desperate bid to get close to the Kaabah, harm or inconvenience anyone. Now,\
  \ as I stood only an arm\u2019s length from it, I wasn\u2019t subject to any jostling,\
  \ struggle or resistance.  The way had been paved for me. As though in a dream,\
  \ I touched and kissed the black shroud covering it. I had come here, grappling\
  \ for something I hadn\u2019t expected to find."
