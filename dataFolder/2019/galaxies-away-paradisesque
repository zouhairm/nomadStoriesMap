Text: "SYNOPSIS\nThis the tale of a journey of six young travellers barely 19 or 20\
  \ years old taking a leap of faith against all stereotypical advices. The mystical\
  \ northeastern state of India, Nagaland, often criticized for its \u2018supposedly\u2019\
  \ hostile environment, treasures a valley that is said to bewitch travellers at\
  \ first glimpse. First contact with the people was comforting as we found the people\
  \ to be kind, helpful, & charming in a city otherwise so downrated by stereotypes.\n\
  \nSTAIRWAY TO HEAVEN\nDzukou Valley is often overshadowed or praised insincerely\
  \ when compared with the clich\xE9 destinations. Some find hardship in the trek\
  \ as an excuse while others are wary of the \u2018so-called\u2019 hostility of the\
  \ region, and among several other reasons to put aside an unfathomable experience\
  \ of a lifetime. To be honest, the question often asked is regarding the difficulty\
  \ of the trek. But what matters more is what awaits us at the end.\n\nTHE CLIMB\n\
  To begin with, the trek on foot starts where the motorable road ends, in the proximity\
  \ of the Viswema village (the second largest village in the state). The journey\
  \ from the Viswema gate to the end of the road took us upwards to the foot of the\
  \ evergreen forest that surrounds the unparalleled greenery of the Dzukou Valley.\
  \ As we looked up we could feel the magical mist around, engulfing the trees and\
  \ bewildering us with awe and amazement. It was as if straight out of a Harry Potter\
  \ novel. With our rucksacks & tripods, we began our ascent but hearing the facts\
  \ from the guides accompanying us actually sent shivers down our spines.\n\nA few\
  \ kilometer steep climb & only the lord knew what awaited us for the hike ahead.\
  \ We were after all, amateurs just fantasizing ourselves as professional hikers.\
  \ However, the thought of giving up would disappear as soon as we would come across\
  \ enthusiastic quotations all along the trek.\n\nI had never been on a climb this\
  \ steep before and was fortunate to have been carrying the weight of only a backpack\
  \ (and off course that of myself). As I looked behind and down the climb I could\
  \ clearly see most of us struggling with the extra weight of the tripods. But the\
  \ promise ahead, that is of a glimpse of natural wonders very few have had the privilege\
  \ to witness, encouraged us all not to give up but to carry on, on a path that undoubtedly\
  \ many would regard as the \u2018stairway to the doors of heaven\u2019. So on we\
  \ went against all odds to enter the gates of heaven.\n\nJOURNEY TO THE BEYOND\n\
  The unspoilt beauty of Dzukou had been hidden by the surrounding forest we had just\
  \ trekked through. This was a much necessary halt for our lunch. We had little idea\
  \ of the terrain for the hike ahead. We were living in & breathing uncertainty.\
  \ The untapped greenery was unrivalled by the likes of anything we had probably\
  \ seen or encountered before. Post lunch, we headed straight for what was to be\
  \ sweeter than all our fantasies.\n\nENDURANCE PAYS OFF\nSo we marched across the\
  \ captivating landscape. The mist whispered a dialect we weren\u2019t familiar with.\
  \ But it felt welcoming. And it was all too much to be true, to be real. By the\
  \ time we reached the campsite to halt for the night, we finally got a complete\
  \ view of the flawlessly dome shaped spread-out of an impossibly green carpet that\
  \ went nearly as far as the limits of the human eyesight.\n\nEXPECT THE UNEXPECTED\n\
  The next day we came across caves, streams and then an almost endless, borderless\
  \ valley of flowers, none of which we had anticipated. We always had a disposable\
  \ bag where we would collect all the plastic trash we came upon. The stereotypes\
  \ originate from the fact that the locals are rude to uneducated & educated fools\
  \ who destroy the valley by dumping plastic everywhere. But to us they seemed kind\
  \ & caring. Our ecstasies, expectations had all been dwarfed by the people, their\
  \ concern for protecting Dzukou from irresponsible visitors & everything about the\
  \ place, it's ambience. We returned with a remarkable tale to tell. But we also\
  \ hoped we made Dzukou a tad bit cleaner too."
