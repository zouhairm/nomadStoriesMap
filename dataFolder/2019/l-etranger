Text: "People always say it will be easy to leave everything behind and get on a plane\
  \ . They don't say what is waiting for you on the other side of the plane journey\
  \ . It\u2019s one thing to plan a journey in your brain and follow paths and see\
  \ dreams come to reality . \n\nI remember it clearly in 2016 when I took my first\
  \ plane journey by myself and it should be something so simple but my throat was\
  \ tightening around the chimes of the clock. My brain swaying to unkown voices trying\
  \ to make sure I didn't miss this plane as for a split second I thought this plane\
  \ was a reflection on my life . If my life were to be successful then surely I should\
  \ have known how to be an adult and navigate my way through an airport.  As I got\
  \ on the plane I saw faces of older people looking at me and I felt my heart beating\
  \ out of my chest of what is to come. \n\nThe gates opened and I found myself lugging\
  \ my suitcases in an unkown country but it wasn\u2019t as unkown as I feared. I\
  \ could understand Italian as I had been studying it for years but for some reason\
  \ I couldn\u2019t remember the technical vocabulary such as passport control. I\
  \ looked up and suddenly the lights and the sky despite it being the same in England\
  \ looked completely different and I was bewildered.  For a week I navigated Rome\
  \ often scared of trying to integrate with others. Time after time I would get lost\
  \ and my heart would beat that little bit faster. Integrating into the country was\
  \ the moment I let go of all the prerequisitions and just started living. I was\
  \ no longer scared to ask for directions or scared to be lost as in a way that is\
  \ all just one piece of the big cake which will call Earth."
