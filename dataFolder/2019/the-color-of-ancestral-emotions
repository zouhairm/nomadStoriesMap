Text: "Portugal is a mental construct, deconstructed and recomposed by a tightrope\
  \ walker. A momentum in the void and a hard but vital landing.\nAs well as his language.\
  \ At first glance it sounds closed, hermetic, inaccessible, if not to the initiates,\
  \ the chosen adepts of the lusophone cult.\nThen instead, it reveals itself in an\
  \ epiphany, with the passing of time, time in which your ego is surrounded and forced\
  \ to surrender by the wild beauty of a place that makes a mockery of its apparent\
  \ immobility while knowingly unleashes its most daring and impetuous character,\
  \ dragging you into a vortex of warmth and welcome.\nLisbon then is a dream set\
  \ on the Tiago. Its dreamlike typology derives from the decadent and avant-garde\
  \ charm of its narrow uphill streets and its colored ceramic facades, from the spasmodic\
  \ slowness of its breath that becomes pure idiosyncrasy for your bold tourist spirit.\n\
  Lisbon does not want light visitors, it rejects the boisterous and superficial rush,\
  \ she wants attentive worshipers.\nIt lets itself be loved only by those who know\
  \ how to grasp the infinite nuances, which seem to escape anyone in that dazzling\
  \ light that leaks from the ether, yet become familiar to your spirit, which suddenly\
  \ finds itself, branded in focus, forever.\nThe sound of fado is a lament and a\
  \ call of love. Saudade, yes, nostalgia.\nMichele, I think, as I smile to my new\
  \ adventure companions, sitting with me on this warm Portuguese night, talking about\
  \ life and making enthusiastic photos, under a statue of the Marquis of Pombal.\
  \ \nOther young people, Portuguese or otherwise, buzz around us, leaning their boxes\
  \ on the ground and improvising in rap lyrics, accompanied by the rhythmic beats\
  \ of the hands that follow the strong beats of the bass.\nIt is two o'clock in the\
  \ morning, the air is clear, the stars shed with life and in the general silence\
  \ of a safe square, the emotional wave of life that raises young people up to immortality\
  \ resounds.\nTime is a sadistic game for framed adults, and to us, rebels in the\
  \ soul, anarchists in flower of the life of the spirit, appears as dilated to the\
  \ maximum, as our absolute portal to infinity and beyond.\nThe sloping terrace on\
  \ the roofs of the city, is the closest horizon to the universe, the sky plunges\
  \ into the Tiago, with its blue velvet night dress, and the waters of iridescent\
  \ silk await him, in their deep ebb and flow slow.\nElisa and I, we get up suddenly\
  \ and decide to reach a small kiosk on the riverfront. So we follow the steep descents\
  \ of an uphill city, with high heels that fit together at each meter, between the\
  \ uneven cobblestones of the road.\nThe buildings cling to each other, like an army\
  \ of walls, which escort our passage, rising upwards, now hiding their vivid colors\
  \ and letting glimpse of some light, from time to time, that floats like a lightning\
  \ bolt, out of the small wooden shutters.\nWe have come down, the waves now more\
  \ insistent and persuasive, lapping the steps of the pier, like long cobalt blue\
  \ tongues, covered with white foam.\nThe laughter, the words are muffled, are softened\
  \ to leave room for the voice of the river, honorary and honored citizen of the\
  \ city of Lisbon. In the distance, the red bridge extends that seems to tend to\
  \ another shore, to another land. The gaze expands in the total vertigo of the boundless\
  \ and wide absence of limits and boundaries. The sweet amarena liqueur, served in\
  \ a cup of dark chocolate, brings back the flavors of a childhood lost in the dawn\
  \ of civilization. The strangeness has happened, the rite of incorporation into\
  \ a land has been accomplished, which welcomes, no one excluded, anyone who loves\
  \ and respects the discreet, all-encompassing beauty of time, history, land and\
  \ sea."
