Text: "Zoe\u2019s long golden hair was whipped into a frenzy by the breeze as we rolled\
  \ our bicycles across the Arno river along the Ponte S Niccolo, the mid-afternoon\
  \ Tuscan sun beaming down. We were being guided around the city by a lovely young\
  \ Florentine named Alessia. \n\nFor the fifteen year-period preceding my arrival\
  \ in Italy, I\u2019d devoted myself entirely to raising my daughter Zoe to the best\
  \ of my abilities as a single father, and we had never been apart for more than\
  \ two consecutive weeks. She is undoubtedly my best friend and my life\u2019s greatest\
  \ achievement. The reason for my melancholy in that otherwise glorious moment in\
  \ Florence was this: in three days I\u2019d be saying goodbye for a year. I had\
  \ been given the opportunity to take a leap into the unknown and travel the world\
  \ as a digital nomad. It was an opportunity that I\u2019d been longing for, and\
  \ one that I couldn\u2019t refuse. \n\nThese feelings continued as we pumped our\
  \ pedals up to the Piazzale Michelangelo, and still further uphill to the Abbazia\
  \ San Miniato al Monte, the highest point in Florence. As I looked out across the\
  \ city, I felt the weight of history, as well as the weight of my decision. We then\
  \ headed out to the countryside, past the grand, gated olive estates and down shaded\
  \ lanes bordered by ten-foot high roughshod stone walls. This route led us back\
  \ into the centre of town. \n\nAfter sharing some delectable Tuscan wine and crostinis,\
  \ I asked our guide where we could find the quintessential Florentine dish, and\
  \ she informed me that we were in luck. The locals love the Lampredotto sandwich:\
  \ the broiled fourth stomach of a cow, served on a brioche bun, dusted with garlic\
  \ salt, a green savoury sauce and finally a red, spicy sauce. There just happened\
  \ to be an excellent shop only a few blocks away. We promptly walked over and pulled\
  \ up a couple of stools at the street-side shop window - where we could see and\
  \ smell the Lampredotto simmering away right under our noses. I ordered a sandwich\
  \ and was treated to a visual feast - the steaming basin of fat where the bread\
  \ was dipped, the Lampredotto being chopped and simmered. Finally my sandwich arrived,\
  \ positively dripping with sauce and juices. The first bite was unlike anything\
  \ I\u2019d ever tasted - an intense, fatty beef flavour with earthy undertones,\
  \ meat that just melts in your mouth, the sauces and garlic coming together in a\
  \ symphony for the tastebuds. I don\u2019t remember much after that first bite -\
  \ only wolfing down the rest of the sandwich in state of bliss - juices dripping\
  \ down my chin, with the light of the setting sun streaming down the alley. \n\n\
  For a few minutes, the Lampredotto sandwich took my mind off the arduous task I\u2019\
  d already begun: saying goodbye. Needless to say, I\u2019ll never forget that afternoon\
  \ in Florence, the feelings and the flavors which will last a lifetime."
