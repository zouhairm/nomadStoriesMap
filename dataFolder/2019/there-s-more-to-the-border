Text: "The Texas state motto is \u201Cfriendship\u201D and yet, I never appreciated\
  \ the friendliness of my home state and the beauty of its diverse landscape, until\
  \ I decided to take a trip to Big Bend National Park with my friend -- a native\
  \ Michigander who was on a quest to cross off another U.S. National Park from his\
  \ bucket list. \n\nWe set off on a cold day in January, on a grey Subaru, to this\
  \ remote park, uniquely situated on the U.S.-Mexico border. Driving through a beautiful\
  \ landscape of cacti, desert flowers, and mountains, we pass several towns including\
  \ Marfa -- where a fake Prada store attracts hipster tourists looking for an Instagram-worthy\
  \ shot and home to the Marfa lights, a mysterious, alien-like set of lights that\
  \ appear occasionally, attracting curious tourists. \n\nFour hours later: It\u2019\
  s dark. It\u2019s freezing. And we\u2019re ravenous. We finally make it to our destination\
  \ -- the White Buffalo Bar, located inside the historic Gage Hotel in Marathon,\
  \ Texas -- known as one of the last frontiers in America. My friend and I walk in\
  \ and while we make our way to the bar, the eyes of strangers follow us. We order\
  \ a Margarita and a hearty buffalo burger (what else would you order in a place\
  \ with a buffalo head at its entrance!) We enjoy our meal while taking notice of\
  \ the cowboy dressed locals, enjoying a beer and a good laugh. We assume they\u2019\
  re locals because they know everyone walking into the bar. We finish our meal and\
  \ head off to bed.\n\nWe\u2019re awaken by the rays of sunshine; we ready ourselves\
  \ for the drive out to the park. We drive across more desert until we see a big\
  \ sign that says we\u2019ve made it. We camp out in the Rio Grande Village and hike\
  \ the Boquillas Canyon trail, a hike up a canyon along the Rio Grande River. The\
  \ hike is moderate but what makes it difficult that day is the blistering wind,\
  \ slapping our faces with dust. Along the hike, we encounter some artisanal crafts\
  \ left on a rock, raising money for a school across the river in the Mexican town\
  \ of Boquillas. One could easily -- with a passport -- cross the border into Mexico\
  \ by taking a boat ride. My friend and I don\u2019t have our passports so we don\u2019\
  t cross. That night, despite the freezing temperatures and bustling wind, I take\
  \ a walk out the tent to stargaze. As an International Dark Sky park, Big Bend offers\
  \ one of the most awe-dropping views of the night sky -- yet another reason to love\
  \ this place. \n\nWe spend the next two days in the Chisos Basin campsite, where\
  \ we hike the Window Trail and the Lost Mine Trail. The Window trail is a 5.6 mile\
  \ hike that is fairly simple to navigate but that has a jaw-dropping view at the\
  \ end -- a beautiful, window-like view of the desert landscape with a gut-wrenching\
  \ drop (if you dare to look down). While enjoying the view before more hikers come\
  \ through, I tell myself to stop looking down. The Lost Mine Trail, on the other\
  \ hand, is a moderate 4.8 mile hike with sweeping views of the Chisos Mountains.\
  \ It\u2019s a scene like no other. We spend some time here, taking in the rays of\
  \ the sun, and enjoying the stillness of it all. \n\nOn our final day, we detour\
  \ out to Santa Elena Canyon to take a quick view of this immense structure and drive\
  \ through the backcountry. Much to our chagrin, the Subaru breaks down somewhere\
  \ between Marfa and Alpine. We\u2019re stuck. In the middle of nowhere Texas. Without\
  \ phone service. Miles away from the nearest town. We have no other choice but to\
  \ hitchhike. We put our thumbs out, and a Ford truck stops. A joyful man, who looks\
  \ a lot like Michael Moore, let\u2019s us onto the bed of his truck that is filled\
  \ with what he proudly describes as hydroponic tomatoes. The man drops us off in\
  \ Alpine but before then, he offers to buy us lunch at a Chinese restaurant -- apparently\
  \ the best in town. We kindly decline -- and immediately call roadside assistance,\
  \ putting an end to our trip."
