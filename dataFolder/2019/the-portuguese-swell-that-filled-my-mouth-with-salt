Text: "The sky started to get dark and there was some rage in the wind. I\u2019m sitting\
  \ on my board taking my breath from that wipeout I just experienced. I am on the\
  \ second peak, the peak on the left has bigger waves but I leave it to the locals.\
  \ It\u2019s a form of respect.\n\nThe ocean just started getting crazy. The set\
  \ I could see coming to me was huge. Beautiful water monsters. I told myself: \xAB\
  \_There\u2019s no way I can take this wave\_\xBB and started paddling as fast as\
  \ I could to the outside. I get over the first five waves but I can feel my body\
  \ shivering from panic. I could barely see the beach as I was so far away from the\
  \ shore. \n\nI see someone paddling towards me. As confident as a fish in the ocean.\
  \ He asks me with a Portuguese accent: \xAB\_Are you okay? It looks like you\u2019\
  re struggling do you need help?\_\xBB I really want to say no but I just say \xAB\
  \_Yes, I don\u2019t have the ability to ride those waves and I don\u2019t know how\
  \ to get back to the shore\_\xBB. \n\nHe grabs the nose of my board and tells me\
  \ \xAB\_Sometimes this happens in Peniche, the series coming now are huge, even\
  \ I sometimes feel uncomfortable with them, just try not to panic, I\u2019ll paddle\
  \ with you to another pic where the waves are smaller.\_\xBB \n\nWe start to paddle\
  \ together to the left whilst the second series of waves gets closer. I am terrified\
  \ and soothed at the same time, I can\u2019t quite describe how I\u2019m feeling.\
  \ \n\nHe keeps on looking back at me to make sure I was following and then tells\
  \ me to paddle quicker. As the set of waves touches the nose of my board, I manage\
  \ to get over the first one as I get slapped by the foam. He gives me a push for\
  \ the second one and as I see this wall about to break on me I say \xAB\_This is\
  \ going to break on me and I\u2019m going to die.\_\xBB I am dramatic but so scared\
  \ that I don\u2019t even know what my body is doing. \n\nIn a matter of seconds,\
  \ he says \xAB\_Get your two feet on your board and jump over the wave\_\xBB I am\
  \ not thinking, I just do what he says. As Im flying in the air over this monster,\
  \ my leach gets caught in the wave and I get pulled down. Maybe thirty seconds,\
  \ but it felt like a lifetime. \n\nI was still on the other side so I reach the\
  \ surface and take the biggest breath I\u2019ve ever taken. \n\nAs we get to the\
  \ smaller pic, he tells me to take that smaller wave. I take off and enjoy my ride\
  \ until I get to the shore. As I\u2019m getting out of the water, my toes touch\
  \ the dry sand. I bend my toes in the sand and realize this is the best feeling\
  \ on earth. He follows me out and I don\u2019t know how many times I thank him for\
  \ helping me. My journey has just begun.\n\nOne second, he tells me his name is\
  \ Pedro. The next, he is showing me around the city.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I was\
  \ nervous before embarking on that trip. I suffered from anxiety and stress the\
  \ previous year like never before. This encounter made everything better. I spent\
  \ the majority of my time in the ocean. Walking, writing and photographing filled\
  \ the rest of my time. \n\nWhen the sun sets, we make a beach fire and play the\
  \ guitar. I sing along \u2018Seven Nation Army\u2019 from the White Stripes. It\
  \ seemed like where I was from didn\u2019t matter, Pedro\u2019s friends were interested\
  \ in who I was. I felt like part of their families for one short second.\n\nPeniche\
  \ is a touristic place known for surf lovers, I\u2019m still going back home with\
  \ an authentic travel experience.\n\nThere\u2019s something about writing it down\
  \ that makes me realize I was brave enough to travel alone and dedicate this trip\
  \ to my passion and to my own self. This trip cured me. I consider myself healed\
  \ by the ocean."
