Text: "Moving to Seville wasn\u2019t entirely a leap into the unknown. I\u2019d been\
  \ to Andalusia most summers during my childhood, as so many Brits do. I was also\
  \ halfway through a degree in Spanish, and had already spent the previous two months\
  \ in Barcelona. This was going to be a piece of cake! Or as the Spaniards say, pan\
  \ comido. \n\nWhat I didn\u2019t bank on, though, was that Seville is not like Barcelona.\
  \ It\u2019s not like anywhere I\u2019d been before, in fact. Barcelona is cosmopolitan,\
  \ worldly, the cool artsy kid at school with a hipster charm that I instantly fell\
  \ for. \n\nSeville is the opposite. It revels in its traditions and history like\
  \ a grand old dame, safe in the knowledge that not only is she still a great beauty,\
  \ but by God, does she have some stories to tell. \n\nEuropean travellers have long\
  \ been fascinated by this beguiling city. The Moorish influence, so clearly marked\
  \ in its architecture, as well as the old saying that \u2018Africa begins in the\
  \ Pyrenees\u2019, made Andalusia a nineteenth-century tourist\u2019s paradise. For\
  \ them, too, it was a kind of controlled foray into the unfamiliar, considered exotic\
  \ enough for the Orientalist tastes favoured by the Victorians whilst still being\
  \ European and, by extension, \u201Csafe\u201D.\n\nQuestionable fetishization of\
  \ the exotic aside, I certainly understood the appeal. Seville\u2019s old-world\
  \ charm truly allows the imagination to run wild; walking down the narrow, labyrinthine\
  \ cobbled streets, passing the Giralda and the Alc\xE1zar, you can practically feel\
  \ the fierce spirit of the city\u2019s infamous Carmen.\n\nMy favourite landmark,\
  \ though not particularly well-known, was the Palacio de las Due\xF1as, a beautiful\
  \ 15th century palace draped in bougainvillea. Here too, I felt that irresistible\
  \ pull into an imagined, idealised past. I was in my element, picturing myself as\
  \ the languid heroine of a romance novel who roams the lush gardens in floaty dresses\
  \ and spends hours reading books in a particular shady spot. I hadn\u2019t felt\
  \ that kind of freedom of imagination in a long time. \n\nThe city\u2019s people\
  \ certainly know the value of their heritage, and the Feria de Abril is testament\
  \ to this love of tradition. Every year, two weeks after Semana Santa, citizens\
  \ don their finest traditional clothes - the full kit can set revellers back several-hundred\
  \ euros - and gather for the fair, dancing traditional sevillanas in the rows of\
  \ marquees, known as casetas, and drinking rebujitos (sherry and lemonade, both\
  \ delicious and dangerous).\n\nI had never even heard of Feria before, I didn\u2019\
  t know how to dance a sevillana, and I certainly didn\u2019t have the appropriate\
  \ costume. But there I was, a pasty British wallflower learning some moves from\
  \ a sassy abuelita and attempting to sing along to songs I didn\u2019t know. That\u2019\
  s just what Seville does to you. \n\nWhat truly struck me about the city, though,\
  \ was its pace. Everything is somehow slower there. Not through lethargy or indifference,\
  \ but rather a sense that there is no need to rush. \n\nMaybe it\u2019s to do with\
  \ that all-consuming heat that makes it feel like you\u2019re walking through treacle.\
  \ The kind of heat that, as a chronically late person who tends to speed-walk everywhere\
  \ she goes, forces you to slow down. \n\nThis even seeps into the way sevillanos\
  \ speak. Words blend into each other, their endings often missed off completely,\
  \ making it very difficult for a foreigner like me to understand at first. The best\
  \ way I can describe it is that they hold phrases loosely in their mouths. They\
  \ speak fast, and the words tumble out unrestricted. By the end of my stay, my Spanish\
  \ was unintentionally sprinkled with sevillanismos, a quirk that I still cherish.\
  \ \n\nSeville showed me that there was a different, less frenetic way of moving\
  \ through life. And for an overworked student, that truly was a leap into the unknown.\
  \ So when I get stressed about a deadline or annoyed with people bumping into me\
  \ on the tube, I try to calm down by remembering what it felt like to walk down\
  \ one of those cobbled streets, sun warming my skin, knowing that I didn\u2019t\
  \ need to race to get to my destination. And usually, it works."
